<h1>Basking in the Warmth</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ghostwriter.html">Ghostwriter</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Amelia sat in the onsen, despondent. She had not heard from Zelgadis since 
the day he left with her bracelet and promising to return to her when he 
had found a cure.

It had been 1 year and 6 months to the day since he left. She almost 
feared that he wasn&#39;t going to return to her. Ever.

With a sigh, she thought of the times she had been with him, rescuing the 
others, being rescued, and in general, all the fun she seemed to have, 
even when they were in danger.

Cephied, how she wished he was there!

The onsen door opened softly, causing Amelia to see who was entering. To 
her joy, Sylphiel walked in slowly, looking for her.

She could relate to Sylphiel easier than the others could, because she 
knew what it was like to be away from a loved one, as well. Poor Sylphiel 
had it worse, though: Gourry Gabriev had given his heart and soul to Lina, 
even if Lina couldn&#39;t see it, the sad look in Sylphiel&#39;s eyes gave away 
that she knew too well that her chances with Gourry were almost as good as 
Sylphiel suddenly being able to cast the Giga-slave.

The purple-haired shrine maiden sat demurely next to her, and she could 
almost feel her heart going out to this nice, sweet person that the rest 
seemed to take for granted. How many times had she been forced to cook for 
not one, but four or five hungry mouths, without being thanked? And the 
thought that Gourry, the densest person in the world would choose Lina 
over... No. She knew Miss Lina had nice qualities, too, but in comparison 
to Sylphiel, Lina seemed the monster the rumors made her out to be.

Sylphiel looked at Amelia shyly. Why was Miss Amelia staring at her like 
that? She seemed to be sad, like something was bothering her.

She blinked, feeling foolish. Amelia was probably feeling lonely for 
Zelgadis, and in she comes, trying to be happy and cheerful, so Amelia has 
to be the good host, and be pleasant, too. Maybe she should leave the 
princess, so that she can get it all out of her system, like Sylphiel 
herself had done a long time ago, when Miss Lina caught Gourry Dear&#39;s eye. 
Maybe...

&quot;Hello, Miss Sylphiel.&quot; Amelia said, playing the part of hostess, &quot;Please 
come in. The water&#39;s perfect.&quot;
Sylphiel returned the greeting, dropping the towel to the onsen floor 
before joining Amelia for a nice, warm soak.

Amelia was surprised. She had never taken a bath with Sylphiel before. The 
purple-tressed girl was not stacked like her sister, but she wasn&#39;t a 
board like Miss Lina, either. She seemed to be perfectly built: Feminine 
softness and Athletic muscle fused together in what one could debate was 
the PERFECT form, unlike her own, top-heavy figure attached to a small 
frame. She blushed as Sylphiel lowered herself deeper into the pool of 
steaming water.

Sylphiel blushed, letting the warmth seep into her. She looked over to see 
Amelia still looking at her, a small blush showing on her face, as well.

It made Sylphiel feel like she was being stared at, but that was 
preposterous! Miss Amelia was a sweet, innocent...

&quot;I can&#39;t believe He picked her over you.&quot; Amelia blurted out, causing 
Sylphiel to blink.

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Sylphiel said, taken aback.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe Gourry chose Lina over you.&quot; Amelia said, still staring 
at her, &quot;You&#39;re so... PERFECT! Your eyes, your smile, your personality...&quot;

Sylphiel was stunned. Amelia was going on, each listed thing sending a 
barb into her heart.

&quot;...Your breasts!&quot; Amelia continued, making Sylphiel wince &quot;Cephied, is 
the man BLIND? Miss Lina&#39;s built like a teenaged BOY, and he could have... 
Could have...&quot;

Amelia blushed, as she realized that she had been speaking her mind too 
openly. The hurt on Sylphiel&#39;s face made it evident that she had probably 
crossed the line of decorum a loooong way back. &quot;Sylphiel, I&#39;m Sorry...&quot; 
she began, but couldn&#39;t continue. She felt like a first-class idiot.

&quot;It&#39;s... It&#39;s all right,&quot; Sylphiel said, trying to spring back to her 
earlier cheeriness, &quot; I... I&#39;m o-over ... him, and... And...&quot; Suddenly, 
her face crumpled into a look of anguish. Without a word, she raced over 
to Amelia, and began crying.

Amelia held Sylphiel as she cried, stroking her soft hair as the tears 
fell from turquoise eyes. Amelia felt a tear hit her shoulder, and slowly 
trickle across her breast. Amelia blinked as a new sensation made itself 
known. It felt good when the tear had trailed across her nipple, causing 
it to become erect. The blush on her face felt like it could heat the 
whole onsen. Unconsciously, a hand slowly wandered its way from the taller 
girl&#39;s shoulder, down to her waist.

Sylphiel stopped crying, feeling something strange happen to her. She 
could feel the soft, gentle hand of the princess of Sairuun on her waist, 
slowly caressing her waist, each time it moved down, it seemed to be 
getting closer to her... her....

Sylphiel blushed. Her face felt like it was a forge fire. She blinked away 
the tears, afraid to look up at the smaller girl that now held her 
tenderly. The princess&#39;s touch was nice, but still, Sylphiel felt 
uncomfortable, though she didn&#39;t know why. She was afraid that the feeling 
might cause Amelia to feel offended, and yet... Yet she found that this 
sensation let her mind wander a little. What was she to do?

What was Amelia to do? She was still slowly caressing her friend&#39;s waist, 
but her arm slowly wended its way lower and lower. Her nipples became very 
attentive: so much so, that she could almost feel them tingling. She 
noticed that Sylphiel had stopped crying, and a &quot;thought&quot; came to her.

Slowly, the princess leaned back, to which Sylphiel responded by slowly 
leaning against her now-closer breast.

Amelia felt as if she had been awakened. She let out a sigh as Sylphiel 
moved lower on her own, even as the arm that had been wrapped around her 
slowly made its way to her other breast.

Sylphiel felt lightheaded. What on earth was she doing? She was now 
nestled on Amelia&#39;s breast, without even knowing how she got there.. 
Everything was a blur, now, and she could feel the warm water lap against 
her nipples, sending her mind whirling in time to the tingling in her 
breasts. She drew her mouth closer to Amelia&#39;s nipple, knowing that, in 
her mind&#39;s eye, she would want to feel the softness of lips on... She 
stopped thinking it, and began to kiss the nipple and all around it, 
almost imagining the same sensation on herself.

Amelia couldn&#39;t stand it, anymore! She felt electric! Her whole body was 
alive just because of this simple touch! And poor Sylphiel! Once again the 
priestess had been giving her an amazing sensation, and she could only 
caress her backside! She felt very annoyed with herself for being so 
selfish, and was going to take care of that RIGHT NOW.

Sylphiel blinked as she felt her head suddenly cradled by Amelia&#39;s soft 
hands. She was afraid to look up, fearing that she had gone too far.

Without words, Amelia came closer to her. She closed her eyes, but opened 
them a moment later when she felt the other&#39;s tongue dance atop her 
nipple. The sensation sent a shiver down her spine, and as soon as the 
sensation was gone, a new sensation slowly emerged as the princess&#39;s hand 
slowly made its way from her behind to her stomach.

Amelia kept caressing Sylphiel&#39;s nipple with her tongue while lightly 
moving her fingers from the priestess&#39;s backside to her stomach. She 
traced circles with her tong as deftly as her hand danced across 
Sylphiel&#39;s abdomen, to which the shrine maiden responded with a gasp. She 
felt Sylphiel&#39;s hands begin to move across her shoulders, to finally end 
up stroking her hair tenderly.

Sylphiel couldn&#39;t help herself: as she stroked Amelia&#39;s hair, she slowly, 
deliberately pressed, against Amelia&#39;s head. To her surprise, she felt the 
princess comply to her gentle urgings and start tracing her tongue along 
her stomach in a way that set her afire. She felt the sensation spread 
from her stomach to between her legs the closer the raven-haired girl drew 
to that spot.

Suddenly, a touch right below her abdomen made her moan, as the tingling 
became a yearning. Why was Amelia taking her time?

Amelia had to pause, letting the sensation of yearning subside. She wanted 
this sensation she was giving to Sylphiel in the worst way! She could 
almost feel Sylphiel&#39;s tongue mirroring her motions, and she felt the 
other girl&#39;s tongue...

The whimper from Amelia sobered Sylphiel up a little bit, as she realized 
that this whole interaction seemed to always be just one-way for each of 
them. She wanted to feel the sensation, yet, she didn&#39;t want Amelia not 
to. It was a quandary that she couldn&#39;t think her way out of.

If only... If only they could both just... Just... She didn&#39;t know! This 
was frustrating! If they could both interact together, instead of one 
doing all the work, then maybe... Maybe... Her head was spinning, and she 
could hear Amelia whimper, causing her to feel even more excited than 
before... What could they do?

Amelia looked at the puzzle form all sides. What they needed to be able to 
do was to mirror the other&#39;s actions, but how? She visualized everything 
she could, but everything seemed to be too bizarre and twisted, and Magic 
really wouldn&#39;t lend itself to this, especially since there was NO WAY to 
keep the concentration needed for such a complex spell, given the 
situation.

Maybe if she thought of this from the bottom-up?

Bottom-up?

That&#39;s it!

&quot;Syphiel,&quot; Amelia said, looking up at the other girl&#39;s blushing, 
sweat-coated face &quot;I would like to try something.&quot;

(Anything!) &quot;O... Okay.&quot; She answered weakly. By Cephied, this had BETTER 
be better than some of the stupid ideas that had been dancing through her 
mind!

Amelia climbed out of the onsen, laid their towels on the floor, and 
beckoned her to follow. She took hold of Amelia&#39;s hand, and gave the 
blushing princess an inquisitive look, even though her eyes kept wandering 
to the other girl&#39;s lush breasts.

Amelia led her over to the towels, and bade her to lay down, to which 
Sylphiel complied.. Maybe this was a better idea: the water could only 
allow so much movement, and too much time in the water could make the 
sensation fade, each time someone had to come up for air.

She was totally surprised when Amelia Sat on her stomach, and gently 
spread her legs apart.

Sylphiel felt her mind whirl. Was this really happening? Fear and 
anticipation filled her. She felt the yearning intensify, as Amelia got 
off her stomach and slid across her breasts, so that her backside was 
almost in Sylphiel&#39;s face. Sylphiel could feel her blush intensify with 
the yearning as she looked at Amelia.

Before Amelia could take the initiative, she felt Sylphiel&#39;s tongue slide 
around the slit in her legs, causing her to squeak in surprise. In an 
instant, the wonderful sensation was gone.

&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; the worried voice of Sylphiel asked. Amelia wished 
she&#39;s just go back to what she had been doing, but it could wait enough 
for her to respond.

&quot;No.&quot; She said, gulping in air, to keep from giving in to pleading, &quot;I was 
just surprised. Just. Surprised.&quot; She gulped again.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Sylphiel said. After a pause she added, &quot;Would you please do that to 
me?&quot;

Amelia almost face-faulted.

Before Amelia could respond, Sylphiel was back to inserting her tongue in 
the most ENJOYABLE fashion into Amelia. She could feel it moving from side 
to side rather nicely. She sighed, until she remembered that SHE had to 
return the favor! She bent down, plunging her tongue into the moistness 
that was Sylphiel.

The flavor was exotic, to say the least, but it wasn&#39;t bad; she found 
herself actually craving the thick liquid that built up the more her 
tongue worked inside her partner in this unusual dance. She felt the 
electric feeling build again, but this time, instead of focusing on one 
place, it spread throughout her system.

That&#39;s when Sylphiel&#39;s tongue landed on that one spot she hadn&#39;t touched 
yet.

Amelia moaned, then decided to return the favor to Sylphiel. She heard the 
other girl moan in satisfaction, but the respite didn&#39;t last, as she was 
once more being touched in that spot.
Strangely, she could feel the sensation building in Sylphiel at the same 
time it grew in her. The rich flavor on her tongue changed slightly, even 
as she felt her body and Sylphiel&#39;s body shiver as if they were caught in 
a chill breeze.

Before long, the shivering built to a point, and she could feel the pent 
up electricity come forth from her mouth in a cry of pleasure. She 
couldn&#39;t be sure, but she could swear Sylphiel joined her in chorus.
Sylphiel opened her eyes, wondering why she felt cold. She turned her 
head, and almost screamed in surprise. Amelia was next to her with a hand 
on her breast, and a blush on her face.

She could understand why: Her face felt aflame as well.

Amelia opened her eyes, noticing that what she had though of as a strange 
dream really had happened.

Both women jumped away form each other, faces burning furiously from 
embarrassment.

&quot;Sorry!&quot; they both said, sharing a mutual feeling of mortification.

Amelia regained her composure somewhat. What they did... What they did was 
a one-time thing! Maybe they could blame it on the um... um... Sake! Yeah! 
That&#39;s it!

Sylphiel was harboring the same thoughts, but fortunately, had more sense 
than the over-hyper princess.

&quot;This,&quot; Sylphiel gasped, trying to regain more composure, &quot;This never 
happened.&quot; She felt sad, but she knew that if it ever got out, then they 
both would just DIE of embarrassment!

She saw Amelia nod her head in agreement, but the look on her face showed 
that the damage had been done. Now, all they could do was pick up the 
pieces, and hope for the best.

There was a ray of hope, though: they could always count on Gourry and 
Lina to ask herself and Amelia Dear to go adventuring with them....

Xellos looked on in annoyance as the two women left the onsen. The magic 
ward was ruined, even after all his meticulous preparation! He was hoping 
to attract Filia in here before anyone else, and then, it was not feasible 
now, and he would have to wait months before he could get the ingredients 
to make that spell work again.

Well, At least it wasn&#39;t a TOTAL Loss: He wondered if he could put the 
notion into their heads to wear glasses the next time...
