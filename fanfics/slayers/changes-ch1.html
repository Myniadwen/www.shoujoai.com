<h1>Everything Changes</h1>

<pre>&#39;Gotta get out of here...&#39; The figure ran panic stricken into the
woods. Why did this happen? All he wanted was a cure... a cure which
wasn&#39;t too hard to ask for. Zelgadis stumbled and fell down a small
hill stopping just an inch from a pool of water. He sit up and looked
at his reflection. &quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot;

---

In another part of the forest, a lonely young woman walked down a path
munching on an apple. She sighed and threw the core over her
shoulder. It had been six months since she had traveled with her
friends and it had been a long six months. Amelia was off doing
Princess things, Gourry and Sylphiel had declared their love for each
other and were planning a wedding, Filia was taking care of baby
Valgaav, Xelloss was off doing mazoku business, Zelgadis was... well
looking for a cure as always. She brushed back her flame, red hair and
wondered about her that one she loved.

&quot;Oh Zelgadis! Why can&#39;t you see how beautiful you really are?&quot; She let
a few silent tears fall down her face and continued down the path.

---

&quot;You know you should have quit when you were ahead?&quot;

&quot;Shut up Xelloss... I so do not need your nagging!&quot; Zelgadis was
pouting and furious. His life had just gone from bad as it can get to
as worse as it can it. &quot;Why me?&quot; Zel sighed and buried his face in his
hands.

&quot;Why? Why not is more like it Zel-kun! You have obsessed over that
little cure for years and now you have been handed the topping to the
cake. However, I think you look better myself.&quot; Xelloss moved closer
with a seductive grin.

&quot;Touch me and die namagomi!&quot; Zel growled and backed away.

&quot;Oh no don&#39;t go away Zelgadis! We can have fun together. I must say I
was attracted to you before, but now I can have a lot more fun with
you. Don&#39;t resist me Zelgadis.&quot; He watched the trembling chimera in
front of him. &#39;It&#39;s so cute watching such resistance, especially when
it&#39;s coming from such a powerless creature.&#39; He chuckled as he stalked
closer.

&quot;Stay away Xelloss!&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you make me?&quot;

&quot;Ra Tilt! ... Wha? Nothing happened... oh damn I forgot.&quot;

&quot;Ironic isn&#39;t it? Your first week as a woman and you start your
period. I just had to take advantage of this quite surprising, but
welcomed situation. Now come on Zel-chan. I want you and I always get
what I want.&quot;

Suddenly and sound was heard from behind them. &quot;Zelgadis get down!
Flare Arrow!&quot;

Zelgadis hit the ground and looked up just in time to see Xelloss
cough black smoke and teleport away cursing. She thanked every god she
could name that she had left her outfit alone. A smile spread on her
face as she looked up to greet Lina. She could cry... oops she
was. &quot;Lina thank you! How did you find us?&quot;

&quot;Zelgadis?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Oh my god! What did he do to you?&quot;

&quot;He didn&#39;t... I sort of brought it on to myself... Do you think we
could go somewhere else and talk?&quot;

Lina nodded and tried to pick up her jaw. &#39;L-sama... he was beautiful
before but... wow...&#39; She blushed when she notice Zel shift
uncomfortably under her gaze. &#39;Geez I need to stop thinking about
it... but she looks... I mean she was a he but she has a better chest
than I will ever have. Especially if I can see it even under all that
baggy clothing. Oops Zel is giving me a weird look.&#39;

&quot;Yeah come on Zel we better get going! There is a inn a few miles down
the road we can talk there.&quot; Zel smiled and nodded in agreement, while
Lina tried to cover up her blush and constant staring. She let Zel go
up the path first frustrated that the cape hid her curves. &#39;Damn... I
bet she is a tease too... What the hell? Inverse get a hold of
yourself... that&#39;s your best friend. Zelgadis who is as hot as a girl
as he was a boy&#39; She slapped herself and caught up with Zel casually
smiling at him. &quot;It&#39;s so nice to see you again in any form Zel.&quot;

Zel looked at her in shock them smiled down at her. &quot;I&#39;m glad somebody
wants me... I missed being with you... guys... So where is Amelia and
Gourry?&quot; Zel looks around to see if anyone else was coming behind
them.

&quot;They aren&#39;t coming Zel... they all left me and I&#39;ve been traveling by
myself.&quot;

&quot;Looks like we have both been in need of companionship...&quot; She takes
Lina&#39;s hand and gives it a little squeeze.

Lina squeaks in surprise. That was the most affection that Zel had
ever given. She was dumbfounded, but giddy with happiness. She smiled
happily at her, then blinked as she noticed Zel blushing.

&quot;I know this is probably not a good time to say this, but...&quot; Zel
stops and takes a deep breath.

&quot;Go on Zel... I&#39;ll listen to you.&quot; Lina smiled, which only caused Zel
to smile a slight sadness in her eyes. She stopped and cupped Lina&#39;s
face with her hands. Lina stopped and looked up only to gaze in those
beautiful pale, blue eyes.

&quot;Lina Inverse... I love you... with every ounce of my being... every
inch of my soul... with everything I am or ever will be... I love
you. That&#39;s why I was trying so hard to get my cure... that&#39;s why I
took the risk of becoming a girl if only to find a cure... for
you... my heart... my soul... the one I&#39;ve always loved... the only
one I will ever love. I promise that I will find a cure and then I
will marry you and take you away... we will live happily and never
have to worry about mazoku or dragons or bandits ever again. I promise
you as soon as I find...&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;No... Zelgadis Graywords I love you for you... and if you are a
chimera and a girl then so be it I will marry you as you are... I&#39;m
tired of waiting. I&#39;m tired of worrying about you... I love you too
Zelgadis... and if you love me than you will stay with me... and if
you want a cure than we will go to better, but I will be the first to
admit that you look wonderful. I can see why Xelloss went after
you...&quot; She knew she was checking Zel out again by the blush that
appeared on those stone cheeks. She smiled. Zel was so cute when he...
err she blushed and right now Lina thought she was
adorable. &quot;Kawaii...&quot; She smiled and leaned forward catching those
elusive lips with her own. She smiled when those lips returned the
gesture kissing her passionately in return. She pulled back to gaze at
Zel. &quot;If you love me... promise never to leave me again.&quot;

&quot;I promise you Lina... I&#39;ll stay if that&#39;s what will make you happy.&quot;

&quot;It definitely will Zelgadis... it definitely will...&quot; She smiled as
she kissed her again finding those lips returning hers warmly.

The End!
