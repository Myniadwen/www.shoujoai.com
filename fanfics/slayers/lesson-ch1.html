<h1>A Strange Lesson</h1>

<pre>&quot;Miss Lina, can you teach me the Dragon Slave?&quot;

&lt;Oh no,&gt; I think, bored, &lt;I was sure she gave up.&gt;

&quot;Amelia, you can&#39;t use black magic, and the Dragon Slave is the most
powerful spell that you can obtain with black magic.&quot;

Amelia looks me with her deer eyes. &quot;Then teach me black magic, please,
Miss Lina, please?&quot;

I roll my eyes, but I know to have lost: &quot;Well, let&#39;s start!&quot;

She is surprised. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because I gave up or because I
start immediately. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good idea, but she is a very
powerful mage and I don&#39;t want her to remain chained by her limitations
as Saylun princess. I continue to repeat myself that it&#39;s the only
reason, but I am lying to myself.

When I met her, she was an intolerable, clumsy little child that wanted
to become a justice paladin. In four years she has become a beautiful,
intelligent, and brave girl, and I have fallen in love with her. I would
become a chimera if it meant she&#39;d watch me more than Zelgadis.

Amelia sit in front of me and I start to tell the differences between the
various styles of magic; I think she knows that but she listens to me and
doesn&#39;t interrupt me, patient at least.

I speak for two hours. I always loved speaking, but especially to her.
When I&#39;ve finished, she doesn&#39;t ask questions, simply gets up and says,
&quot;See you tomorrow Miss Lina.&quot;

&quot;No, wait here.&quot; She stops, &quot;Amelia, let&#39;s start the practice now. Do you
prefer the curses or the attack spells?&quot;

She smiles. &quot;The attack spells, obviously.&quot; I smile as an answer.

The following hours are very hard for me, as we go to a vast plain near
the town and I start to show some spells: I show her a spell, I explain
the spell, and she casts the spell. I&#39;m astonished; I had known Amelia
was good at magic but this is incredible! Well, not really, when the
teacher is me; I&#39;m sure if I was patient, I could teach magic to Gourry.
&quot;Amelia, I&#39;m tired. Let&#39;s relax a minute.&quot; By now it&#39;s sunset.

She looks me. &quot;I&#39;ll go to get something to drink and to eat, wait a
minute!&quot; She flies to the town, and I ask to myself where she gets all
the energy.

I must have fallen asleep because when I wake up there is a tablecloth on
the ground with much food on it. Amelia, with bright voice, chirps, &quot;I
saw that you were sleeping and I thought to lay out the table.&quot;

I hug her, she is surprised but hugs me in return. I watch her; she is
smiling, her eyes so full of love...I kiss her, her soft lips against
mine. I deepen the kiss, and to my delight, she doesn&#39;t flee. When I
stop, I&#39;m shaken. &quot;Amelia, I&#39;m sorry, I...&quot; My voice is low, and I don&#39;t
think she hears my next words, &quot;I love you.&quot;

She blushes; my face is the same colour as my hair. &quot;Miss Lina, I thought
you loved Mr Gourry.&quot;

I cling to her. &quot;I know you love Zel, but, please, don&#39;t leave me alone,
forgive me for today, please.&quot; This is the first time in my life that I
plead, but this is Amelia and I&#39;d die if she started to hate me.

She embraces me and with soothing voice: &quot;I&#39;m happy, I&#39;m very happy about
today. I love Zelgadis, but that&#39;s normal; he&#39;s my cousin. However, I&#39;ll
explain about that matter soon. Now there are other things more important
than that. The person that rules my dreams is you now. I love you, Lina.&quot;

Lina, not Miss Lina. She is not lying; she never decieves. She loves me.
Please, don&#39;t wake me up if this is a dream. She doesn&#39;t love Zel but me.
My heart beats faster. Her eyes are so full of light and love...for me! I
feel happy finally. My life is complete.

In her eyes there is playful shining, &quot;Lina, dare not to eat and I&#39;ll
kill you!&quot;

I facefault, then laugh. We start to eat, enjoying each other&#39;s company.

This is a magic night. It&#39;s only for her and me. &quot;Please, stay with me
this night! Let&#39;s take this night for only us, Amelia.&quot; She hugs me and
we wait till dawn and the life that will come, together.
