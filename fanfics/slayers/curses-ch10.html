<a href="../slayers/curses-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Xel floated beside the bed, a concerned look still on his face. Seraya
was recovering, but she needed a little more time. Meanwhile, Zel was
getting worse. They needed her, but if she wasn&#39;t fully recovered...

&quot;Xelloss-san?&quot; He didn&#39;t look away as Amelia walked in quietly.

&quot;What is it,&quot; he asked, doing his best to keep his voice neutral. So much
had happened to him too, he felt he could sleep for a decade.

&quot;I thought I might be able to at least speed her recovery a little.&quot; Xel
looked up at the princess, eyes closed.

&quot;Then do it, we need her.&quot; Amelia nodded and moved to the side of the
bed.

&quot;... She&#39;s beautiful...&quot;

&quot;Hai, she is...&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Amelia, get a hold of yourself and help her,&quot; he said, a small note of
impatience slipping in. The princess blushed lightly and held her hands
over Ser, startng to cast her recovery spells.

&lt;Why do I have feelings for someone I just met&gt;, Amelia asked herself. One
of Amelia&#39;s spells had a strange effect, and an aura appeared around Ser.

&quot;What&#39;s that aura for,&quot; Xel asked.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure, it&#39;s like.. a low level love spell.&quot; Xel frowned inwardly,
keeping his face neutral.

&quot;Why does she have a love spell on her?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll have to ask when she wakes up.&quot; It was quite a smack in the face
for the Mazoku who thought he had very tight control on his protection
spells. &lt;My love for Seraya... is because of a love spell??&gt;

Xel was considering looking for some quiet pocket dimension to think
about this, but the thought was abandoned when Ser regained
consciousness, whispering his name. Almost by reflex he floated to beside
her and held her hand in his.

&quot;I&#39;m here, Ser-chan...&quot; A look of relief passed over her face, then she
opened her eyes and looked up at him.

&quot;Xel-chan...&quot; He smiled softly, gently squeezing her hand.

&quot;How do you feel, Seraya-san?&quot; Ser looked at Amelia, her eyes pale but
slowly recovering.

&quot;Much better, thank you.&quot; Amelia blushed again, like a young girl when
her crush compliments her.

&quot;It was nothing, rea - &quot; Lina burst into the room, interrupting the
princess.

&quot;He&#39;s getting worse, we&#39;re losing him!&quot; Ser sat up.

&quot;Who? What&#39;s happening?&quot;

&quot;Zelgadis-san was attacked by Zur and we need help to heal him.&quot; Ser
nodded, thinking of what she remembered while under the shadow&#39;s control.

&quot;I can help him, I saw Zur&#39;s attacks...&quot; Ser climbed to her feet, and
tried to take a step but nearly collapsed had it not been for Xel there
to catch her. She smiled and lightly kissed his cheek.

&quot;Let&#39;s get you to Zel-kun.&quot;
