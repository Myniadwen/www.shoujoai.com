&quot;They&#39;re tougher than I thought.&quot; He paused. &quot;That sword... if it could
do this to me, what will it do to Zur?&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Xel nodded, listening to Lina&#39;s summary of the battle. &quot;They&#39;re dark
creatures, so light and white magic will hurt them. The problem is, the
only one near who has that kind of power is Ser-chan.&quot;

Lina nodded slightly, still looking down at Zel. &quot;We need to free her
first, then with her help we can heal Zel and defeat Zur.&quot;

&quot;And Granite, he just disappeared last time,&quot; Gourry remarked in a moment
of intelligence. Xel and Lina glanced up at him, then nodded in
agreement.

&quot;What about Zel? Shouldn&#39;t we get him someplace safe until we can free
Ser?&quot; Xel smirked a moment which turned into a grimace of pain.

&quot;Yes, an excellent idea.&quot; The small group teleported away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Xelloss-san?!&quot; Just hearing the voice again made Lina&#39;s spine tingle.
Amelia&#39;s eyes were wide in shock and surprise, Xel still had nasty burns
all over him.

They had teleported to Sailoon, directly into the palace as to avoid the
guards. &quot;Hello, Amelia.&quot;

&quot;What happened to you?&quot; He sighed quietly, really not wanting to talk
about it.

&quot;Sore wa...&quot; he started to say before she shrieked and rushed to Gourry
who was holding...

&quot;Zelgadis-san!!&quot; Lina sweatdropped and sighed as well.

&quot;Amelia, we don&#39;t have time. We need a place to keep him safe until we
can find Seraya.&quot; The princess was barely listening, throwing every
healing spell she knew at the chimera but none had any effect.

&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; she said quietly after exhausting her knowledge of
spells.

After putting Zel in a guarded room filled with the kingdom&#39;s best
healers, the sorceress, swordsman and priest were ready to return to
battle when Amelia stopped them. &quot;Wait! In the defense of truth and
justice, I will join you in vanquishing the great evil that dared attack
Xelloss-san and my Zelgadis-san!&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s got white magic, we might need her to free Seraya.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t have much of a choice, Xel.&quot;

&quot;... Fine, she can go with us.&quot; He was just about to teleport them when
Amelia interrupted a second time.

&quot;Just one question: Who&#39;s Seraya?&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;My Lord, these opponents are more powerful than we believed,&quot; Granite
reported when he returned to Zur&#39;s side.

&quot;Have no fear, Granite, there is not a white magic caster among them, we
shall defeat them easily.&quot;

&quot;But Lord, they&#39;ve recruited another. She&#39;s a young white mage, the same
as Seraya.&quot; Zur looked down at the blond girl, who was staring blankly
out into the darkness around them.

&quot;She isn&#39;t nearly as powerful. We will defeat her as well.&quot; Granite
nodded.

&quot;Of course, Lord Zur.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The group traveled through the dark dimension, Xel leading them. He was
still visibly injured but was rapidly regaining his power. Lina was close
behind him, keeping a Lighting spell floating above them to discourage a
certain shadowy figure from appearing.

Amelia walked behind them, babbling about &quot;the Truth and Justice Knight
Seraya&quot; she couldn&#39;t wait to meet, or how she would &quot;defeat the evil Zur
in the name of justice, love and Zelgadis.&quot; The others did their best to
tune the princess out.

Gourry brought up the rear, keeping the Sword of Light ready. Granite
could appear at any time now.

Finally charging enough energy, Xel stopped where he was. &quot;I can teleport
us again. Be on guard, Zur and Granite could be anywhere.&quot; The others
nodded and were teleported...

...directly into Hell.
