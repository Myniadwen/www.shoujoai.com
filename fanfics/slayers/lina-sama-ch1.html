<h1>Aishiteru, Lina-sama</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/teh.html">Michael Teh</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Gourry!&quot; Lina&#39;s voice came booming loudly from an inn in a small village.
The inn was not famous, it didn&#39;t have any of the local delicacies which
were considered worth while, but the ever searching Lina Inverse was
always ready to eat, no matter what the place.  Lina smashed Gourry&#39;s
head into the table.  Gourry coughed out a large bone, extremely clean,
not even a spot of gravy was left on it.  &quot;That was mine!&quot;  Lina fumes.

&quot;You didn&#39;t look interested!&quot; Gourry replies as he pulls his embedded head
from the wooden table.  The waitress sighs as she signals the others that
they would be needing a new table soon.  Lina sat back down and sighed,
the side spit was gone, so her meal wasn&#39;t complete.  Lina immediately
ordered more dishes from the kitchen.  The chef was crying a fit when
he heard Lina&#39;s order.  It was rediculous since the only time he would
prepare for such a meal is when an army would roll pass this village.
Amelia gnaws at what was left of the meat on a bone which she had.
Food was sacred when Lina was around.  If you didn&#39;t eat it, it would be
gone before you can even blink.  She sighs as she saw the amount of food
which came rushing out from the kitchen.  She thanked Ceiphied that this
wasn&#39;t going to be charged on her royal account.  Lina&#39;s group had just
raided a large bandit camp, and the loot was plenty, so... Lina decided
to break for dinner.  A dinner that would last most of the night anyways.
So Amelia&#39;s side, Zelgadis just casually sips his tea.  This was his third
cup since Lina started to eat.  And considering how Zelgadis just &#39;sips&#39;
his tea, that meant it was a while ago since they started.  To Zelgadis&#39;
side, Sylphield just sat quietly, meditating and ignoring the constant
arguing coming from Lina and Gourry.  A waitress approached Zelgadis
and Sylphield and refilled their cups.  They didn&#39;t mind since drinks
were considered free by the inn&#39;s standard.

&quot;Your friends sure love to eat...&quot; The waitress smiles with a slight
frown added into it.

&quot;That&#39;s nothing.&quot; Zelgadis replies as he flips open a paper print which
the waitress passed him a while back.  &quot;You should see when Amelia
is hungry!  The three of them could clean this whole village.&quot;

&quot;Zelgadis-san.&quot; Sylphield frowns, &quot;That&#39;s not nice to talk to people
like that.&quot;  Zelgadis just smirked as he went back to his paper.

&quot;But your two friends sure make a cute couple.&quot; The waitress smiles as
she leaves.  Sylphield blinked as she looked at Lina and Gourry.  The two
of them were fighting over a plate.  She looked closer, seeing something
she didn&#39;t want to see.  Even though their faces were grunting and baring
teeths, she could still see a hint of smile and joyous at the antics which
they were doing.  They liked acting like this.  It has become almost a
ritual habit of the two, and it wouldn&#39;t be right if one was not there.
Sylphield looks away casually as not to attract attention to her reaction.
She never admit it, she could never admit it.  Seeing Lina and Gourry
together had been the worst thing to happen in her life behind seeing the
death of her father and hometown by copy-Rezo.  She knew Gourry didn&#39;t
have the same feelings towards her as she does to him, and with Lina,
she may never get Gourry to love her.

&quot;Excuse me.&quot; Sylphield slowly gets up, &quot;I think I&#39;ll turn in now.&quot;

&quot;You feeling okay?&quot; Zelgadis looked up, Sylphield just smiles, nods
and heads upstairs.  Lina and Gourry both paused seeing her leave, then
went back to their eating competition.  This was too much, even for her.
Gourry was so absorbed in their eating contest, he didn&#39;t even inquire
about her departure.  But why would he?  To him, they were just friends,
Gourry just liked her cooking, and that was the only way he could
remember her.  It wasn&#39;t fair.  He remembered Lina through and through,
and yet, the first time they meet back at Sairaag, it took him nearly
a whole minute to remember her.  Which in Gourry&#39;s case was a miracle.
As Sylphield reached the top of the stairs, her walking turned into
a sprits towards her room.  She opened the door and slammed it with a
lady-like gentleness.  She collapse into her bed and weeped the night
away.

&quot;He doesn&#39;t love you...&quot; A voice rang in Sylphield&#39;s head.  &quot;Nobody loves
you...&quot;  Sylphield slowly nodded her head.  She took off her boots
and gloves.  She removes her priestess robe and lay back into bed,
buried her face into the pillow once again.  She continued to weep.
&quot;This isn&#39;t a game anymore...&quot; The voice continued, &quot;If he doesn&#39;t love
you, then he doesn&#39;t deserve your love!&quot;  Sylphield opened her eyes.
&quot;You should find a way to make him PAY!  Make him regret not loving you!&quot;
Sylphield shook her head.  She now recognise the voice in her head.
It was the same voice everytime she saw Lina and Gourry together.
The voice almost screamed when she saw Gourry rush up towards the chaotic
energy to reach Lina during the incident with Hellmaster Phibrizo.  She
was always aware of it, always trying to block its voice from her mind.
Whenever she heard it, it always spoke evilishly about Gourry, or Lina.
Sylphield tried to block out its evil intentions, but as time wore on,
she gotten more and more compelled to agree with the voice.  Sylphield&#39;s
nature itself was slowly being torn apart as she tried to fight the voice.
She is gentle and supportive, and yet, the voice was like an unrequitted
desire that layed deep inside that she couldn&#39;t hide forever.

Sylphield closes her eyes and drifted into a dreamless, restless sleep.
Neither the warm bed, nor the comfortable atmosphere and pillows supported
her sleep as she tossed and turned as the night wore on.  The voice was
now like a whisper, unconsciously growing, coming into the consciousness.
Finally after an eternity of agony, Sylphield woke up from her sleep.
She sat up in bed, looked at the sheets she slept in.  She wiped the sweat
from her forehead and neck.  Her shirt was soaked with sweat and her hair
hung ragged around her.  She looked up towards the mirror that stood in
front of her bed.  A face stared back, but a face she didn&#39;t recognise.
Eyes stared back with a stare that she only got when she faced Hellmaster
Phibrizo; Anger... pure hatred.  But somehow, she liked what she saw in
front of her.  A smile crept on her lips as she looked into the mirror,
the shadow hiding most of her face, but she could still see.  For the
first time, Sylphield was feeling happy.  But it wasn&#39;t a warm happiness,
it was a cold, dark happiness that only she could enjoy.  She knew what
she wanted to do.  She was going to make them PAY!  Gourry and Lina will
face Sylphield&#39;s wraith.  They will now learn the agony and pain they
put her through with each and every day.

Outside Sylphield&#39;s room, a figure slowly smiled as he enjoyed Sylphield&#39;s
agony and building of evil.  This was going to be an interesting
development!  What was he going to do about this?  Sorewa Himitsu Desu!

&quot;Aishiteru, Lina-sama!&quot;
***********************

&quot;Sylphield!&quot; Lina smiles as Sylphield comes down the stairs.  &quot;You&#39;re
up early.  Everyone is still asleep.&quot;  Sylphield smiled as she noticed
that Lina had a napkin tucked under her neck and fork and knife in hand.
That means that she was ready for an early breakfast.

[Perfect...] Sylphield thought to herself as she looked at Lina.
&quot;Lina-san, I have a request...&quot;

&quot;Hai?&quot; Lina blinked as she waited for her food to come.

&quot;I was wondering whether you would like to go out on a walk with me
this morning?&quot; Sylphield walks up to Lina and bends down and whispers
in her ear.  &quot;I want to talk with you in private...&quot;

&quot;O-kay...&quot; Lina nodded slowly.  &quot;Miss, keep that breakfast warm!
I&#39;ll be right back!&quot;  Lina calls to the waitress.  The waitress yawns
and rubs her eyes as she heads into the kitchen to tell the chef.  Soon,
Lina and Sylphield were quietly walking on the grounds behind the inn.
The place was a forest with nice walking paths to guide travellers safely
around the forest.  The morning was cool as due began to form around the
leaves as the sun rises slowly to warm things up.  Sylphield shivered
slightly as she realized that she left her robe in her room.  She was
only wearing her shirt, shorts and nylons.  And the fact that she had
her shirt opened half way last night didn&#39;t help.  Sylphield looked at
Lina as they continue to walk deeper into the forest.  Sylphield smiled
evilly as she saw Lina was staring at her opened shirt and at her chest.

[She was always vain about her appearance, especially her
breast!] Sylphield smiled, [I can work that to my advantage!]  Soon,
Sylphield stopped walking along the path and turned into a small clear
patch of grass behind some bushes.

&quot;So, Sylphield...&quot; Lina paused as Sylphield kneels down so her head was
hidden from view.  Lina followed, slightly curious, so both of them were
hidden from any stroller&#39;s view.  &quot;What is it you want to talk to me in
private for?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s about...&quot; Sylphield switched face to her sad, concerned and afraid
face.  &quot;My feelings for Gourry-sama...&quot;  Sylphield took a deep breath.
&quot;Are things going okay between you and Gourry?&quot;

&quot;Th... things?!&quot; Lina blinked.  &quot;What things?!  There&#39;s nothing going
on between Gourry and me!&quot;  Sylphield smiled as she notices Lina was
almost in a panic state.  &quot;Nothing!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid...&quot; Sylphield sighs, &quot;I&#39;ve lost my interest in Gourry-sama.&quot;
Sylphield shook her head.  &quot;I can&#39;t think of Gourry as my crush and love
anymore!&quot;  Lina&#39;s eyes opened wide as she actually heard Sylphield not
calling Gourry &#39;Gourry-sama&#39; that time.  &quot;Gourry doesn&#39;t seem attractive
to me anymore...  He&#39;s just a big blob of muscles and yogurt.&quot;

&quot;Sylphield...&quot; Lina continues to stare at Sylphield with concern.
&quot;You feeling alright?  You left dinner awfully early yesterday...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; Sylphield said,  &quot;I&#39;m more than fine now that I have my
head cleared after so long.&quot;  Sylphield clasp Lina&#39;s hands in hers.
&quot;All those years, wasted longing for Gourry&#39;s affection, a waste of time!&quot;

&quot;So...&quot; Lina blinked, &quot;You found someone else?  Another Gourry-sama, eh?&quot;
Lina teesed, hoping to catch Sylphield off guard, causing her to tell
her whether she really got over Gourry.

&quot;Yes!&quot; Sylphield nodded firmly, which caused Lina&#39;s face to slack
somewhat, not expecting this.  Sylphield brought Lina&#39;s hands which she
had in her hands towards her face.  She gently rubs the back of Lina&#39;s
hands with her cheek.  &quot;You, Lina-sama!&quot;  Lina&#39;s face froze like a stone.
Sylphield blinked as she felt Lina&#39;s hands suddenly crumble away from
her hands.  Lina&#39;s body had grumbled like a well aged stone that has
been crushed by a hammer.  &quot;Lina-sama...&quot; Lina suddenly pieced herself
together and quickly backed against the bush the best she could.

&quot;S... Syl... Sylphield!&quot; Lina&#39;s face was all a panic and sweat.
&quot;You&#39;re kidding right?!&quot; Lina lets loose a nervous laughter.  &quot;Yeah,
that&#39;s it!  You&#39;re just joking around.  I knew there was no way you&#39;d
loose your interest in Gourry!&quot;  In response, Sylphield crept closer
and wrapped her arms around the sorceress&#39; neck.

&quot;You smell so sweet, Lina-sama...&quot; Sylphield coos as she hugs Lina close
to her body.  &quot;You&#39;re so warm...&quot;  Lina&#39;s face was now so stiff that she
couldn&#39;t let out a single word, her brain was frozen.  Her body tried
to run away, but it couldn&#39;t find any messages from the brain saying to
get up and run like heck until she was as far from Sylphield as possible.
Sylphield slowly brought her face forward and gently brushed Lina&#39;s lips
with her own.  Almost a kiss, but not close enough for it.

&quot;Z... Zelgadis!&quot; Lina screamed, &quot;Amelia, Gourry!  You can stop hiding
behind those bushes... this joke as gone on long enough!&quot;  Sylphield
suddenly pushed Lina back with such force that she broke several branches
on the bush behind her.

&quot;L... LINA-SAMA!&quot; Sylphield screamed, &quot;You&#39;re... YOU&#39;RE A MEANIE!&quot;
She got up and turned around, her voice started to break up.  &quot;I... I
showed you... my feelings... for you... and you... you treat it like
it... was some kind of joke!&quot;  With that she held her hand to her face and
started to cry.  &quot;You&#39;re just like Gourry!  I knew it!  You don&#39;t care!
None of you care!  WHY DID I EVER TALK YOU?!&quot;  She quickly rushed through
the bushes back on to the main trail.  &quot;I don&#39;t want to see ANY of you,
EVER AGAIN!!!&quot;  With that, Sylphield disappeared behind the trees.

&quot;SYLPHIELD!!!&quot; Lina cried out as she tried to rush after her, but she was
held back by a few loose branches which caught her cloak.  She struggled
for a minute or two, but when she finished untangling her cloak, she
knew Sylphield would be long gone.  She paused as she suddenly heard
some noices in some other bush.

&quot;Are you sure?!&quot; A female voice spoke.  Lina blinked as she almost
recognises it.  &quot;Right here?  In public?&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot; A male voice replies.  Lina&#39;s eyes shot wide as she recognises
the male voice.  Her mouth worded the word &#39;Gourry&#39; and then she listened
carefully.  &quot;You&#39;re so beautiful...&quot; Lina was stunned once again as she
heard the two kissing.

&quot;Oh yes...&quot; The female voice moaned, &quot;Right there...&quot;  Lina finally
placed the female voice as Amelia.  She could hear the rustling of
clothes, followed by a few trinkets.  Lina suddenly jumped back as a
sword hilt suddenly fell back right beside her.  Her face began to grow
angry as she recognises the hilt.  It was the sword which Gourry had
replaced for his sword of light.  The moaning started to grow more
intense as the breathing grew heavier and heavier.  There was the
sound of constant repeated movement.  Lina couldn&#39;t take it anymore.
She wanted to shoot up and blast the two of them with a Dragon Slave,
but she refrained herself as she stole back slowly towards the inn.
The two of them were going to pay... DEARLY!

Watching Lina dash away, a figure chuckles to himself as he follows the
angered sorceress back to the inn.

Lina burst into the inn, which at this time had a few customers.
She stopped as her face changed from raging dragon anger, to concerned
weeping willow sadness.  Sitting at the table they sat in last night
was Zelgadis, who was busy sipping his tea, and Sylphield, who was just
sitting there, not doing a single thing.  Her eyes were hidden from
view as she hung her head down.  She cautiously steps into the inn and
sat down beside Zelgadis, away from Sylphield.  Sylphield didn&#39;t even
acknowledged her presence.  After a long moment of pause, and after the
waitress finally brings Lina her breakfast, Lina broke the silence.

&quot;Zel?&quot; Zelgadis looked up from his papers at Lina, &quot;Where are Gourry
and Amelia?&quot;  Zelgadis pondered momentarily.

&quot;Amelia told me she wanted to get a suvenier from the nearest
store...&quot; Zelgadis replies, &quot;Gourry... he said something about getting
his sword sharpened by the local blacksmith!&quot;  Lina&#39;s rage returned as
she had confirmed her fear.

&quot;Is something wrong, Lina-san?&quot; A voice calls from the side.  Lina looks
up at the familiar face.  Purple hair, smile on the lips, closed eyes.

&quot;Xelloss?!&quot; Lina blinked,  &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Xelloss smiled, &quot;I can&#39;t even visit my favorite troops without
stirring some sort of deep dark secret hovering around me?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot; Zelgadis replies as he lost his appitite for the tea as soon as
he saw Xelloss.  Lina started to eat her breakfast without anymore word.
After half the food was gone, Lina frowned.

&quot;What&#39;s taking Gourry so long?&quot; Lina looks towards the inn doors.

&quot;Excuse me...&quot; Sylphield spoke suddenly as she got up and left the inn.
Lina felt like someone had once again slapped her physically, mentally and
astrally over and over again.  Zelgadis raised an eye brow at Lina as he
notices Sylphield leaving.  Lina didn&#39;t pay attention to Zelgadis as she
felt a pain in her stomach, forcing her to lose her appitite completely.

&quot;What was all that about?&quot; Xelloss blinked.  &quot;Is everything alright here?
Why is everyone so silent?&quot;

&quot;Nothing concerns you, Xelloss.&quot; Zelgadis grunted as he went back to
reading his paper.  Soon, Gourry came walking into the inn.

&quot;Yo!&quot; Gourry smiles, &quot;Sorry I took so long, but the blacksmith didn&#39;t open
shop until sunrise...&quot; Gourry paused as he suddenly felt the atmosphere
in the inn dropped below freezing.  The costumers also felt this as all
eyes turned towards Lina.

&quot;So, that&#39;s your explanation?&quot; Lina smiled coldly.

&quot;Y... eah...&quot; Gourry nodded slowly as he tried to move towards the table
in the freezing temperature.

&quot;Why is your hair such a mess?&quot; Lina frowns.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Gourry blinked as he dust his hair, bits of leaves and branches
fell out of his long blond hair.  &quot;I fell down into some bushes along
the way back!&quot;

&quot;And the wrinkled smelly clothes?&quot; Lina grabbed his shirt and stared
at him.

&quot;It&#39;s wrinkled from the heat and steam from the blacksmith&#39;s shop!&quot; Gourry
replies.  &quot;I&#39;m telling you, this sword is a lot more hassle than my
sword of light!  I miss it...&quot; Without further questioning, Gourry
managed to sit down.  &quot;Is this anyones?&quot; Gourry pointed towards the
rest of Lina&#39;s food.  Lina stared at Gourry, and waves her hand, Gourry
immediately ordered three more helpings of what Lina had and started on
the left overs.

&quot;HI!&quot; Amelia burst into the inn with sunshine all around her.  &quot;Sorry I&#39;m
late, but I...&quot; Amelia froze like a popsicle as another wave of coldness
suddenly surges through the inn.

&quot;Damn!  I just got the stove relight!&quot; The chef cries out from in the
kitchen.

&quot;L... Lina-san?&quot; Amelia blinked, &quot;Is something wrong?!&quot;

&quot;Where have you been all morning?&quot; Lina sits Amelia down and holds a
lightning spell over her head.

&quot;A... All over town!&quot; Amelia replies, &quot;I told Zelgadis-san that I was
out sovenier shopping!&quot;

&quot;Really?!&quot; Lina looks accusingly, &quot;And where are all your soveniers?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Amelia choked a little, &quot;I sent them home by royal mail!  That&#39;s
why I took so long!  They don&#39;t open till sun-up!&quot;  Lina sat back,
her anger fueled body drained from overexertion.

&quot;Is something wrong, Lina-san?&quot; Amelia blinked.  Lina just stared.
Amelia and Gourry both looked at each other, shrugged their shoulders
and started on breakfast.  Lina&#39;s eagle eyes constantly baring down
on them, making them extremely uncomfortable.  After a brief moment
of uncomfortability, Sylphield suddenly returned and sat down quietly.
Lina&#39;s gaze shifted towards the priestess who didn&#39;t acknowledge the gaze.
The rest of breakfast went on with extreme tension going all around,
except from Xelloss, who just watched as the tension grew thick and
Zelgadis who casually sips his tea, ignoring the tension since he had
gotten use to the anger fueling during dinner, why should this be any
different.

After breakfast, everyone packed up and headed out.  During the journey,
Sylphield kept as far away from Lina as possible, while Lina was split
between wanting to go over and talk to Sylphield, and staring at Gourry
and Amelia.  Gourry and Amelia both were standing far away from Lina as
possible, and together no less, which increased Lina&#39;s fueling anger.
Zelgadis and Xelloss just walked behind, looking somewhat sheepish.

&quot;Do you have any idea what&#39;s going on?&quot; Xelloss frowns.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t...&quot; Zelgadis replies.  &quot;I thought YOU would know!&quot;  Xelloss
shook his head from side to side, looking a touch baffled.  He quickly
turns away and releases a slight snicker and returned to watching the
drama suspense develope in front of him.  Finally after an hour walk,
Lina decided and walks over to Sylphield.

&quot;Sylphield!&quot; Lina whispers.  Sylphield just kept walking, neither
acknowledging Lina&#39;s presence, nor her calling.  &quot;Sylphield, please
speak to me!&quot;

&quot;Zelgadis-san?&quot; Sylphield looked over to Zelgadis, and stared right
through Lina as if she wasn&#39;t there.  &quot;Did you hear something?&quot;
Zelgadis didn&#39;t want to be brought into this so he kept his mouth shut.

&quot;Okay, that does it!&quot; Lina yelled as she grabbed Sylphield by the cape and
dragged her off into the woods beside them.  Everyone stopped and just
stared as Lina disappeared with Sylphield behind the woods.  &quot;And you
two don&#39;t try anything!!!&quot; Lina&#39;s head suddenly popped back and yelled
at Amelia and Gourry.  Both who which jumped back suddenly.  Amelia was
so scared she jumped into the closes arms, which happened to be Gourry&#39;s.
Lina breathed fire.  &quot;DILL BRANDO!!!&quot;  Zelgadis sighs as Gourry and Amelia
went flying into the air.  He side steps and Gourry collapse head first
into the ground, burying his head and shoulders, Amelia levitated down,
then collapse from the shock of the Dill Brando.  After a quick stroll
through the forest, Lina finally sets Sylphield down in front of her.
&quot;Now... will you please listen to me, Sylphield?&quot;  Sylphield just folded
her arms and looked away.  &quot;Okay... I promise not to make any more jokes
about your feelings... I know they are geniune now.  Please... can we talk
about it?&quot;  Sylphield unfold her arms, looking at Lina, she immediately
burst into tears and buried her face into Lina&#39;s chest.

&quot;Lina-sama!&quot; Sylphield cried, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry... I know it was mean of
me... but I couldn&#39;t help myself... please... forgive me!&quot;

&quot;No, Sylphield...&quot; Lina wraps her arms around the crying priestess,
&quot;It&#39;s me who you should forgive.  I didn&#39;t know... I didn&#39;t know your
feelings for Gourry had changed.  I&#39;m sorry I stole him from you from
the beginning... and I&#39;m sorry I made fun of you.  Please forgive me...&quot;
Sylphield slowly got up and dried her tears with a cloth Lina gave her.
&quot;But I also am sorry, Sylphield...&quot; Lina cleared her throat, &quot;I don&#39;t feel
the same way about you as you do to me... you see... I&#39;m not into...&quot; Lina
looks at Sylphield shyly, &quot;You know...&quot;

&quot;Other girls?&quot; Sylphield sighs, Lina nods silently, &quot;So was I... then as
I got to know you...&quot; Sylphield blushed slightly.  [By Ceiphied... this
is getting too good!  I&#39;ll be making her squirm with displeasure and
hesitation in no time, then she&#39;ll be mine and I&#39;ll drop the bomb
on Gourry, then they&#39;ll regret this!]  &quot;But please, Lina-sama... at
least... give it one try!&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Lina blinked as she looks at Sylphield with confusion.

&quot;Go out on a date with me!&quot; Sylphield replies.  &quot;Just this once!
Please...!  Then if you feel that you don&#39;t like being with me... then
I&#39;ll...&quot; Sylphield turns away, &quot;I won&#39;t bug you, or call you Lina-sama
ever again...&quot;

&quot;Sylphield...&quot; Lina looked worrily at Sylphield, &quot;Please, I don&#39;t want to
make you sad...  You can call me &#39;Lina-sama&#39; all you want.  Just please,
don&#39;t be sad... You&#39;ve already had your home destroyed, your father
killed... Gourry... Please, don&#39;t be sad.  I&#39;ll go out with you!&quot;
Sylphield turned around.

&quot;R... really?&quot; Sylphield blinked.

&quot;Yes!&quot; Lina nods, &quot;I&#39;ll go out with you... as much times as you like!&quot;
Sylphield held her hands together and cried out loud.

&quot;Oh, thank-you, Lina-sama!&quot; Sylphield weeped as she hugged the sorceress
and buried her face against Lina&#39;s shoulder.  Lina returned the hug as
she gently rocked Sylphield.  Soon, Lina and Sylphield returned to the
main path, seeing Amelia hiding behind Xelloss, Zelgadis dusting a dazed
Gourry off.

&quot;I take it one crisis has been averted?&quot; Zelgadis frowned as he looked at
Sylphield&#39;s renewed smiling face.  Sylphield nodded as she walks ahead.
Lina nodded, looking at Amelia and Gourry and joined Sylphield ahead.
Zelgadis looked at Xelloss, who shrugged his shoulders.  They just
walked forward, Zelgadis guiding the still dazed Gourry, and Amelia
hiding behind Xelloss&#39; cape.  Up ahead, Sylphield reached to the side
and held Lina&#39;s hand, much to her displeasure.  She thanked Ceiphied
that their capes blocked the others from seeing this from behind.

That night, they arrived at a large city.  They checked into a local
inn and they all settled down ready for dinner.  Sylphield smiled as
she looked at herself in the mirror.  She changed out of her priestess
clothing and into a sky blue dress with light golden strips of clothes
all arranged here and there.  She smiled at herself.  [This is going
so perfectly!  Lina will play right into my hands, I&#39;ll be the one
controlling her, then Gourry will be devestated so badly that he&#39;ll
leave, heartbroken, alone and wishing that he settled with me in the
first place!]

&quot;So, what&#39;s the plan tonight?&quot; Xelloss smiled as he suddenly appeared
behind Sylphield.

&quot;X... Xelloss-san!&quot; Sylphield whirled around, causing the dress she
didn&#39;t do up properly to fall down in the most inappropriate areas.
Xelloss&#39; eye brows went up when he saw Sylphield.  &quot;Wha...&quot; Sylphield
quickly puts the dress on properly, &quot;What are you doing here?!  If I
weren&#39;t so lady like, I&#39;d be screaming pervert right about now!&quot;

&quot;Oh, you&#39;re one to talk!&quot; Xelloss smiles, &quot;Trying to get revenge on Lina
and Gourry by acting like a lesbian, eh?&quot;  Sylphield blinked as she
saw that Xelloss knew her plans.  &quot;It&#39;s really not like you!&quot; Xelloss
drifted close up to Sylphield.  &quot;Why the sudden change of personality?&quot;

&quot;It is not of your concern!&quot; Sylphield replies.  &quot;I can act any way
I like!  I just realized last night that my life was going to be the
same... over and over again!  Lonely and miserable!  And it&#39;s all the
fault of Lina!&quot;

&quot;Harsh...&quot; Xelloss frowned.  &quot;So in other words, your repressed feelings
have finally surfaced and you couldn&#39;t stand it anymore?&quot;  Sylphield just
looks at Xelloss with dark, cold eyes.  &quot;So... tell me what you&#39;re going
to do tonight!&quot;

&quot;Why should I?&quot; Sylphield turns around trying to get the last few buttons
at the back of her dress.  Xelloss reached and started to do them up
for her.

&quot;Because...&quot; Xelloss looked at Sylphield&#39;s face and opens his eyes.
&quot;I like what you&#39;re doing!  I want to help as best I can!&quot;  Sylphield
turned around after Xelloss finished doing up her dress.  &quot;From one
priest to another...!&quot;  Sylphield sighs as she went over to her closet
and brought out a suitable dark blue overcoat for her dress.

&quot;Okay...&quot; Sylphield replies, &quot;Just keep the others out of my
hair!&quot; Sylphield replies, &quot;Tonight, I&#39;m going to take Lina to dinner,
then we&#39;ll take in the sights of the town.  Then the park... and then,
a nice hot dip in the local hot spring!  That&#39;s when I&#39;ll make the
moves on Lina-sama!  I&#39;ll show her what men will never learn in terms
of pleasuring of the female body!  She&#39;ll be so captivated that she&#39;ll
never want to leave me!&quot;

&quot;And how does a priestess know about the pleasures of the female
body?&quot; Xelloss smiles as he eyes Sylphield&#39;s body, and lick his lips.

&quot;I was preparing for Gourry when I did my first!&quot; Sylphield smiled,
&quot;I&#39;m still a virgin, but then again, I&#39;m not the pure priestess which
everyone thinks I am!  I&#39;m only human, you know!&quot;  With that, Sylphield
heads towards the door.  &quot;I just hope that Lina&#39;s feelings for Gourry
won&#39;t get in the way!&quot;

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about that!&quot; Xelloss smiled, &quot;You know how Lina has been
acting towards Amelia and Gourry?&quot;  Sylphield nodded slowly, &quot;That&#39;s
my doing!  This morning, as you two hid behind some bushes, I guided a
couple towards the nearest bush, I voiced over their voices with that
of Gourry and Amelia, and they made out right there!&quot;  Sylphield almost
laughed at Xelloss&#39; antics.  She smiled and nodded as she headed out.
Xelloss smiles as he disappears from the room.  Meanwhile, Sylphield
approaches Lina&#39;s room.  She taps on to the door.  Lina replies and
Sylphield enters the room.

&quot;Lina-sama...&quot; Sylphield&#39;s voice was caught as she saw Lina.
Instead of the short, boyish sorceress she always sees, Lina now
was dress in a orangish-yellow dress which flows all around her body,
hugging her curves, proving that she wasn&#39;t a boy, but definitely a girl.
&quot;You... you&#39;re beautiful!&quot;  Lina blushed slightly at Sylphield&#39;s comment.
&quot;I don&#39;t care what Gourry says... you&#39;re the most beautiful girl I&#39;ve ever
seen in my whole life!&quot;  Sylphield held out her hand, which Lina took it.
Both of them headed down to the inn&#39;s main floor and started to leave.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Amelia blinked as she saw the both of them, &quot;Why are you dress up
like that, Sylphield-san, Lina-san?!&quot;  Gourry stops eating and looks up
from his food.  Zelgadis looks at both Lina and Sylphield and blushed
slightly, quickly hide his face into a new set of papers he got at
this inn.

&quot;Umm...&quot; Lina blinked as sweat slowly developes on her face.  &quot;Girl&#39;s
night out!  We&#39;re going to see the town!&quot;

&quot;Really?!&quot; Amelia squeels.  &quot;Wait right there!  I&#39;ll put on my dress and
join you!&quot;  Amelia&#39;s feet suddenly halted as Xelloss suddenly appears
in front of her.  &quot;Xelloss-san!&quot;

&quot;That might not be a good idea!&quot; Xelloss smiles, &quot;Remember...&quot; Xelloss
whispers into the princess&#39; ear.  &quot;Lina-san is still upset with you!
Who knows how she&#39;ll treat you during the outing?&quot;

&quot;Oh, Xelloss-san!&quot; Amelia smiles as she twirls around the priest.  &quot;It&#39;s a
girl&#39;s night out!  We won&#39;t kill each other!  That&#39;s the whole point of
the girl&#39;s night out!  To enjoy ourselves, and to get to know each other,
and forgive each other for the things we&#39;ve done in the past!  And general
all the way SHOPPING!!!&quot;  Sylphield gave Xelloss a glare.  Xelloss quickly
vanished in a blink of an eye.  Lina and Sylphield waited at the bar,
which was the polite thing to do, and as to not raise attention as to
their true intention for tonight.  Soon, Xelloss reappeared by the table.

&quot;Yah...&quot; Xelloss sighs as he rubs his head.  &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you know it, the
princess can&#39;t make her mind as to what dress to wear!&quot;  He smiles as
Zelgadis eyes him suspiciously.  &quot;She tried on so many dressed that she
passed out from exhaustion!&quot;  With that he looked at Lina and Sylphield,
&quot;You two go ahead!  Amelia will understand.&quot;  Lina and Sylphield nodded
and left the inn.  Xelloss sat down at an empty seat with Zelgadis
and Gourry.

&quot;Really?&quot; Zelgadis frowned at the priest.

&quot;Really!&quot; Xelloss replies to the chimera.

&quot;Well, that&#39;s believable!&quot; Zelgadis nodded as he returns to his papers.
&quot;Amelia always brought too many stuff... I wonder where she keeps them
as we travel!&quot;

&quot;Sorewa Himitsu Desu!&quot; Xelloss replies.  In Amelia&#39;s room, the princess
was asleep on a pile of her dresses.  The snoore was loud enough to
attract attention, but Xelloss put a silence spell around the room,
so no one will wake her, and no one will hear her.

&quot;Where first?&quot; Lina smiles as Sylphield looks around the town.
The streets were filled with people and markets going all around.

&quot;Shopping fetish!&quot; Sylphield smiles as the two girls went on a shopping
craze, buying anything from clothes to jewelry.  Lina looks towards
Sylphield and smiles as she sees that for the first time in a long
while, Sylphield was actually smiling, genuinely smiling.  Sylphield was
happy, and being with her made Lina feel warm all over as she watches
the priestess quickly stripping down, putting on a dress, making it look
like a fashion show.  When it came to the jewelry, Lina had to pause when
Sylphield bought her a wonderful ruby ring, with gold ring.  The ruby
was so red that Sylphield commented that it matches her wonderful eyes.
In return, Lina bought Sylphield an emerald ring, which composed of
a dark green emerald in the center surrounded by blue crystals along
the outside, all held by a golden ring.  Sylphield looks at it as
Lina commented that it matches her dress and made her look stunning.
Sylphield lets a tear out and says she&#39;ll treasure it forever.  Soon,
the shopping was coming to a close, as both girls had their bags sent
back to the inn and both were too tired to continue.

&quot;So, where do you want to go now?&quot; Lina smiles as she looks about her.

&quot;Somewhere...&quot; Sylphield sighs, &quot;Romantic... solitude...&quot;  Sylphield
paused as she heard Lina&#39;s stomach suddenly growl.  &quot;And a place with
good food!&quot;  Both of them laughed as they searched for a restaurant.
They finally found a fancy restaurant that rents out the roof, which was
high above the bussling streets below.  They came up to the roof, which
had candles lit all around, just enough to enhance the starlights above.
At the center of the roof, there was a single table with two chairs and
a candle between them.

&quot;Wow...&quot; Lina blinked as she looks at the setting.  &quot;What a romantic
place!&quot;

&quot;I thought so too...&quot; Sylphield smiles as she hugs Lina gently.
Lina&#39;s face flushed somewhat as she quickly went ahead and sat down.
Soon a waiter appears beside them.  They ordered and the waiter left.
His purple hair, barely visible by the light of the candle.

&quot;So...&quot; Lina broke the silence quickly, &quot;What do you want to talk about?&quot;
Sylphield just looked gently at Lina&#39;s face.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to talk, Lina-sama...&quot; Sylphield smiles as she looks deeply
into Lina&#39;s red eyes, which flickers with the candle between them.
&quot;I want to look into your eyes...&quot; Lina jumped suddenly as she felt
Sylphield&#39;s feet slowly gliding up her leg, giving it smooth strokes
against her bare skin.  &quot;I want to see all the beauty that is you...&quot;
Lina sat silently, feeling extremely uneasy as she felt Sylphield&#39;s eyes
study every single detail of her body.  She almost felt like Sylphield
could see right through her clothes and was looking at her nude body.
She decided to break the uneasiness by doing to same, that way she&#39;ll
be able to tell Gourry what he missed when he broke Sylphield&#39;s heart,
and as far as she&#39;s concern, he deserves it!  Lina&#39;s eyes trailed from
her purple hair, to her deep purple eyes, her smooth flawless skin
on her cheek, her long, graceful neck, smooth shoulders, Lina&#39;s eyes
finally settles down on Sylphield&#39;s breast.  The heaving of Sylphield&#39;s
breast from her heavy breathing was making it swell and it seemed to keep
swelling with each breath, not contracting as she releases her breath.

[So that&#39;s how Naga keeps it looking like she has twice the size than
it appears to be...] Lina thought as she blushed slightly.  Sylphield
certainly did not lack in that area as her breast filled out the dress,
and looked like it was going to rip with each breath.  That immediately
brought her to her own breast, which were no where near compared to
Sylphield&#39;s.

&quot;Do you like them?&quot; Sylphield smiles.  Lina snaps her gaze and look
at Sylphield.  The blush much more evident on her face.

&quot;W... wha... what?!&quot; Lina quickly replies.

&quot;My breast?&quot; Sylphield coos.  &quot;You know... you can have them this
size too...&quot;  Lina&#39;s ears turned red.  &quot;I can show you...&quot;

&quot;Maybe later!&quot; Lina quickly replies.  Soon, the waiter returns to the roof
with several dozen trays and trolleys of food.  Lina thanked Ceiphied once
again as she realized that the table cloth covering the table stretched
all the way down to the ground, therefore hiding the fact that Sylphield&#39;s
foot had reached up to Lina&#39;s knees and were slowly gliding inward.
The coming of food caused Sylphield to retract her foot to settle
and eat.  The night continued as Lina and Sylphield continued to eat.
After the serving of the last dish, the waiter bows, accepting the cash
which Lina casually reached into her jacket and plopped a bag of gold.
&quot;Shall we be off?!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the hurry?&quot; Sylphield smiles.  Lina quickly jumps up and backs
away from the table as she found Sylphield&#39;s foot was just too far up
her leg for comfort.  Sylphield sighs with disappointment as she got
her jacket and joined Lina and headed back down to the streets below.

&quot;Thank-you.&quot; The waiter bows, &quot;Come again...&quot;  Sylphield looks at the
waiter as he gives her a wink.  Next stop, Lina and Sylphield arrived
at the park.  The sky was dark, illuminated by lights from the moon
and stars.  The flowing river nearby sparkled with darkness and light
as it flows downstream towards a clear dark lake.

&quot;Oh... Lina-sama...&quot; Sylphield leans against Lina, wrapping one arm
around Lina&#39;s waist, holding her close.  &quot;Isn&#39;t this a wonderful scene?&quot;
Lina nodded slowly as she absorbs the whole scene.  Maybe being with
Sylphield here isn&#39;t so bad.  If she was here with a guy, she&#39;d be worried
about his roaming hands and his roaming eyes.  Sylphield still had roaming
hands, but it stayed on her waist, and Lina knew that Sylphield wouldn&#39;t
do anything.  &quot;I&#39;m so happy you&#39;re here with me... my Lina-sama...&quot;  Lina
nodded, but paused as she felt Sylphield&#39;s hot breath breathing against
her ear.  She barely made out what Sylphield said, but she knew it.
&quot;Aishiteru... Lina-sama...&quot;  Lina turned her face to face Sylphield.
Their face was centimeters apart.  Lina looks deep into Sylphield&#39;s
dark eyes.  So gentle and kind, unlike Gourry&#39;s stupid and clueless
eyes.  She leaned closer, wanting to gaze deeper into those eyes, which
held undying love to her.  Sylphield gazed into Lina&#39;s dark red eyes,
which gazed back at her with wonder and excitement.  [Yes!  I have her
now!] Sylphield thought.  Then her eyes started to grow bigger and bigger.
[What wonderful eyes... so beautiful... so lovely...] Sylphield mentally
blinked suddenly, [What am I thinking?!  I have Lina right where I want
her... or does she have me where I wants her?  What is happening... how
can this be happening?!]

&quot;Well, well, well...&quot; A grunting voice startled both of them suddenly.
&quot;What have we got here?!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you ladies know it&#39;s not nice to travel in the park at
night?&quot; Another voice spoke, more higher and like a crow screeching.

&quot;It can be dangerous!&quot; Two more figure rose from the bushes, &quot;Especially
when there could be bandits about this place!&quot;

&quot;Bandits like us!&quot; A large man appears behind the others.  &quot;Get them!
Don&#39;t hurt them... I wouldn&#39;t mind a little sport before we kill them
and take their valuables!&quot;  The group of bandits instantly split into
two groups.

&quot;Stupid bandits...&quot; Lina groans as she points to the first group.
They charged instantly get got into a good position.  &quot;Dill Brando!&quot;
The two bandits instantly went flying into the air and splashed into
the pond.  &quot;Sylphield!&quot; Lina turns around as she sees that Sylphield had
fallen back, she was trembling and unable to fight back.  &quot;Flare Arrow!&quot;
The other two bandits got blown back and were soaking in the river.

&quot;I&#39;ve got you now!&quot; The bandit leader growls as he rushed Lina while
she was distracted by the other two.  Lina whirls around, she suddenly
stopped as she felt her foot slip on a stone, causing her to loose
balance, and therefore couldn&#39;t cast a spell on time.

&quot;LINA-SAMA!!!&quot; Sylphield screamed.  &quot;FLARE-ARROW!!!&quot;  Lina shaded her
eyes as a huge explosion ruptured in front of her, sending the bandit
leader flying straight into the air and disappeared over the horizon.
Lina looks at Sylphield, who lowers her hand from the spell casting.

&quot;Wow...&quot; Lina blinked.  &quot;That was great, Sylphield!&quot;  Lina cheers as
she wraps her arms around Sylphield.  &quot;That had to be a high level Flare
arrow if I didn&#39;t see it!  Even higher than the one I thought you!&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Sylphield gasped, &quot;I just saw you... I wanted to save
you... and...&quot;  Lina smiled as she wipes Sylphield&#39;s face.  She then
giggled as she looked at Sylphield.  &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I think we&#39;d better clean up...&quot; Lina laughs, as she looks at the ground.
They had landed in a muddy place, and all their clothes were soiled and
muddy, including Sylphield&#39;s face, which Lina touched.  They decided to
go to the local hot spring, since Sylphield had suggested it was the
next place they would go.  Above on the tree tops, Xelloss drops the
bag of gold on the unconscious bandits.

&quot;Good job!&quot; Xelloss smiles, &quot;Been nice doing business with you!&quot;  Soon the
two arrived at the hot spring.  The office lady offered to clean their
clothes as they soak in the springs.  Lina and Sylphield both sighs in
relief as they entered the hot spring.  It was late in night and the hot
spring was empty.  Sylphield slowly slide off the towel wrapped around
her body and tossed it on the stone ground.  Lina&#39;s face went all red
when she saw Sylphield do that.

&quot;Sylphield!&quot; Lina protested.

&quot;What?&quot; Sylphield smiles, &quot;There&#39;s no one around... and
besides...&quot; Sylphield glided closer to Lina.  &quot;I want my Lina-sama
to know every inch of my body...&quot;  With that, Sylphield stood up from
the water.  Lina&#39;s whole face turned red, not from the heat of the hot
spring, as she looked at a nude Sylphield standing in front of her.
&quot;Come on...&quot; Sylphield grabbed on to Lina&#39;s towel and started to pull.

&quot;Gah, Sylphield, stop!&quot; Lina screamed.  Sylphield closed on Lina,
pressing her body against Lina&#39;s as she managed to remove the towel
from Lina.  She grabbed Lina&#39;s breast and started to squeeze them.
Lina lets out an unconscious moan as she felt Sylphield touch her.
Sylphield&#39;s hands started to explore along Lina&#39;s body.  Slippery due
to the hot spring water, Sylphield slide Lina over so they were facing
each other.  Lina looked at Sylphield with eyes of both confusion and
wanting.  Sylphield slowly lean forward and kisses Lina fully on the lips.
Their lips glided against each other, parted and their tongues started to
explore the new sensation both were having.  Their bodies slide smoothly
against each other as they embraced and felt each other&#39;s warmth spread
all over their bodies.  Skin sliding against skin, Lina moans like she
never had.  All the treasures, all the food in the world was nothing
in compared to what she was feeling now as Sylphield&#39;s hand started to
explore between Lina&#39;s legs.  &quot;Sylphield... Aishiteru...!&quot;  Lina moans
through her lips as Sylphield continued to massage with her hands.
Sylphield&#39;s eyes went wide as she heard Lina spoke through her gasp
of air.

[She... she loves me!] Sylphield gasped as she felt Lina&#39;s lips increasing
the passion that flowed between them.  Her eyes started to water with
tears.  [She loves me!]  Sylphield could hardly believe it.  She didn&#39;t
want to believe it, but her shattered heart suddenly started to mend,
and it flowed once again with love as she continued to make love to the
person who loved her back.  [No, she doesn&#39;t!] A voice suddenly spoke,
[No!  Don&#39;t fall in love!  Don&#39;t let her hurt you again!]  The voice
started to grow smaller and smaller as Sylphield felt Lina&#39;s legs wrap
themselves around her, her hand removed from between Lina&#39;s legs as they
started to passionately rock gently against each other.

&quot;Watch out, Gourry, you idiot!&quot;  Both girls froze as they heard a crash,
the barrier seperating the men&#39;s side from the women&#39;s side was broken,
as Gourry had slipped on a wet stone and crashed through.  &quot;What are you
two doing here?&quot; Zelgadis blinked as he looked at Lina and Sylphield.
After several screamings from the girls, followed by several painful
screams from the guys, they all started to head inside.  Amelia frowned
as she and Xelloss met them at the entrance of the hot spring.  All four
of them weren&#39;t talking.  Zelgadis, Lina and Sylphield&#39;s face were red
as it was going to get, while Gourry was normal clueless state, though
slightly red for that embarassing situation with the wall.  After an
appology to the owner of the hot spring, they walked towards the inn.
Later that night, Lina walks through a quiet hallway, uncertain as to
the feeling she was having right now.

&quot;Lina...&quot; Lina paused as she heard Gourry&#39;s voice calling her.  Lina turns
around looking at Gourry.  &quot;Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Lina frowned, &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot;  After a few moments, Lina looked
up at Gourry.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; Gourry asked with an extreme gentle voice.

&quot;I&#39;m just... so mixed up!&quot; Lina replies.  Gourry hugs Lina gently.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Lina.&quot; Gourry reassures the red hair, &quot;Whatever the problem
is, we&#39;ll work it out!  You always work it out!&quot;  Lina just rest against
Gourry, letting his strong arms comfort her.

&quot;Even if it means hurting people?&quot; Lina whispers, beyond Gourry&#39;s hearing.
Somewhere down the hallway, a dark figure stood there, watching the two.

[So that&#39;s it...] Sylphield watches the two, [All an act... she really
doesn&#39;t love me...  She was just using me...]  Sylphield went back into
her room and closes the door.  She rips off her blue dress and casually
wore her shirt.  She sat down in bed, and gazed at the emerald ring Lina
bought for her.  Sylphield pulled it off her finger.  She threw it in the
air and raised her hand.  &quot;Flare... Arrow!&quot;  The flare arrow burst into
the air, but before it could hit the ring, it quivered and only popped the
ring.  The ring landed on a nearby candle, melting the wax from the heat,
but the ring was still intact.  Sylphield buried her face into the pillow,
[Well that&#39;s fine!  I don&#39;t love her, either!  I&#39;ll get them!  I&#39;ll get
them... I&#39;ll get them...] A voice just kept echoing through the night.

&quot;Gourry...&quot; Lina whispers, this time, just enough for Gourry to listen.
Gourry &#39;hmm&#39;ed in acknowledgement.  Lina slowly pushed Gourry away.
&quot;I&#39;m sorry... it&#39;s over between us...&quot;  Gourry looked as Lina drifted
from his hands and disappears in her own room.

&quot;I understand...&quot; Gourry nods as he heads to his own room.  A dark purple
hair figure watches the two leave.  Gourry looks at Xelloss and smiles.
&quot;Thanks for putting me straight...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Xelloss replies as he pats Gourry supportingly on the
shoulder and closes the door behind Gourry&#39;s room.  Tonight, two pair
of eyes will shed tears, and one shall not shed any.

Next morning, Sylphield comes down the stairs of the inn.  Seeing Lina
suddenly waiting at the base of the stairs.  Lina saw Sylphield and waited
as she comes down the stairs.  Sylphield took her time as she decended,
looking at Lina with cold eyes.

&quot;Sylphield...&quot; Lina spoke as Sylphield reached the bottom of the stairs.
Sylphield raised a hand and closes it around Lina&#39;s mouth.

&quot;No...&quot; Sylphield spoke with unbelievable coldness.  &quot;Say no more,
Lina!&quot;  Lina&#39;s eyes opened when Sylphield didn&#39;t call her &#39;Lina-sama&#39;
at that point.  &quot;I saw you and Gourry last night...&quot; Lina&#39;s eyes widen
even more as she felt Sylphield&#39;s other hand wrap themselves around her
throat.  &quot;You don&#39;t love me...&quot;  Lina felt her neck being contracted by
Sylphield&#39;s hand, cutting off air from her lungs.  &quot;You never loved me...&quot;
Lina quickly gripped Sylphield&#39;s hand on her throat and tried to pull it
away, but Sylphield showed remarkable strength.  &quot;You were just toying
with my feelings...&quot;  Lina&#39;s lungs started to burn as it desired to intake
air, but nothing came.  &quot;Well then... Lina...&quot; Sylphield releases Lina&#39;s
mouth and used her other hand to increase the pressure on Lina&#39;s throat.
&quot;YOU CAN DIE!&quot;  Lina&#39;s colour was slowly draining from her face.  &quot;I HATE
YOU!  I HATE GOURRY!  I HATE YOU ALL!!!  I&#39;LL MAKE YOU ALL SUFFER!!!&quot;

&quot;SYLPHIELD!!!&quot; Zelgadis suddenly appeared beside them, he grabbed
Sylphield&#39;s hands and pulled them away from Lina.  Lina collapse on the
ground, half conscious, gasping desperately as air starts to circulate
in her lungs.  &quot;What in Ceiphied&#39;s name are you doing?!&quot;  Sylphield
yanked her hands away from Zelgadis and instantly ran out of the inn.
Zelgadis started to give chase when Lina stopped him.

&quot;No!&quot;  Lina coughs out, &quot;Zelgadis... stop!  It&#39;s my fault...&quot;  Lina slowly
got up.  &quot;Don&#39;t blame Sylphield...&quot; Lina lean against the wall, hiding her
face from Zelgadis as tears stream down her face.  Later that day, the
park was deserted.  A lone figure stood by the river / lake view point.
She took off her priestess cloak and braced to rip it into pieces.

&quot;Hey, lady!&quot; A voice grunted behind Sylphield.  &quot;Didn&#39;t you know it&#39;s
not safe to travel around the park?&quot;

&quot;Especially alone?&quot; Another voice spoke, more higher and like a crow
screeching.

&quot;It can be dangerous!&quot; Two more figure rose from the bushes, &quot;Especially
when there could be bandits about this place!&quot;

&quot;Bandits like us!&quot; A large man appears behind the others.  Sylphield looks
back, startling the leader bandit somewhat.  &quot;Hey!  It&#39;s that frail
chick from last night!&quot;

&quot;At least this time she doesn&#39;t have her friend to save her!&quot; The grunting
voice laughs.  &quot;This will be easy!&quot;  Sylphield felt her arms being caught
and tugged behind her back.  It hurt, but she didn&#39;t care.

&quot;You know...&quot; The man with the high voice smiles, &quot;She&#39;s even lovelier
in the light!  Man, is she built!&quot;

&quot;Well, looks like we&#39;ll be having that fun we promised her last
night!&quot; The leader chuckles.  Sylphield closes her eyes as she felt her
feet being tied, her clothes ripped apart.

&quot;Excuse me...&quot; The bandit leader paused as he heard a voice behind him.
Sylphield opens her eyes.  &quot;But... didn&#39;t you learn your lesson last
night?&quot;  Sylphield closes her eyes as tears came pouring out of them.
&quot;MEGA BRANDO!!!&quot; A huge explosion erupted around Sylphield.

&quot;Leave me alone...&quot; Sylphield whispers as tears continue to flow down
her cheek.  &quot;Please... just leave me alone!&quot;  Sylphield stopped when
she felt a hand gently lifts her head by her chin, then a warm, soft
lips made contact with hers.  At first, Sylphield was shocked, then
as she felt a tongue part her lips, she brought her own tongue out and
intensify the kiss.

&quot;Well done again!&quot; Xelloss smiles as he hands two bags of gold to the
unconscious bandits.  After ten minutes of kissing, being held in her arm,
Lina finally broke and spoke.

&quot;You didn&#39;t listen, Sylphield...&quot; Lina whispers.  &quot;I told Gourry... it
was over.  I don&#39;t love Gourry anymore...&quot; Sylphield&#39;s eyes opened
as they slowly adjusted, seeing Lina&#39;s red shirt.  &quot;Aishiteru,
Sylphield-sama...&quot; With that, Lina brought out the emerald ring she bought
and slide it on Sylphield&#39;s ring finger.  Sylphield looks at the ring and
tears started to fall from her eyes.  Lina covered Sylphield with her
cloak and cut away the ropes around her arm and legs.  Sylphield felt
weak as she lean into Lina and Lina helps her back towards the inn.
&quot;Everyone will be happy to see you safe.  Listen Sylphield... even if you
don&#39;t have lovers... you will ALWAYS have friends...&quot;  Sylphield smiles
as she leans her head against Lina&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;And now... you have me!&quot;

&quot;Aishiteru, Lina-sama!&quot;
