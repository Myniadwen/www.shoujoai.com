<h1>Short Story</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rvincent.html">Robert Vincent</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Note: Just count every paragraph as a seperate scene, the area
between the snowflakes is Lina thinking.

/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\

We see Lina walking down a narrow dirt road. Her cape flaps
erratically in the slightly abundant autumn wind. Her face is set
foreword starring at the quickly sitting sun overall creating a highly
dramatic atmosphere. Her pace fails to waver as she walks in silence
and begins to think...

*********************

She rushes down the stairs and straight into her seat next to Gourry.
She sighs pleasantly, a fact that somehow does not go unnoticed on one
as dense as Gourry. He lovingly wraps an arm around her and she sinks
into his embrace.

Just her and Gourry again, it seemed to be happening more and more
lately. The two of them sat in silence, it wasn&#39;t an awkward silence,
they were after all more then a little comfortable with one another.
Gourry, for once, was dressed formally in a tuxedo and his sword was
strangely absent. However she was the real shocker, just as decked out
as Gourry, she was wearing a full length scarlet dress, and looked
absolutely stunning. The whole reason for them dressing up as such was
due to the high standards of the Restaurant Gourry and herself chose to
dine at. They simply sat and stared lovingly into each others eyes, and
when the food came, the normal savage barbarity that was often
associated with the two of them eating was strangely absent. It was, to
herself and Gourry, a perfect night.

They had just defeated hell master and the two were in for some major
celebrating, following the wedding of Martina and Zangoliss. The wine
was flowing freely and as the night wore on she seemed to be feeling a
little tipsy. She worked her way up the stairs and was shocked to see
Gourry just standing there. He turned to her and their eyes locked and
she realized tonight was the night. All she could feel was love...

********************

Lina turned to her side and stared at her traveling companion. &quot;So how
did I end up with you anyway?&quot; Amelia just smiled, then Lina smiled as
they traveled down the winding road and off to the sun.
