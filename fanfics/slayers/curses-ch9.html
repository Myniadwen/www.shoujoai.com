<h1>Curses and Control (part 9 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a>

<a href="../slayers/curses-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Some say Hell is fire and heat. This hell was dark and freezing cold.
None were dressed for the subzero temperatures they appeared in, and even
Xel couldn&#39;t hold back a shiver.

&quot;W-what h-hap-ppened,&quot; Amelia asked through chattering teeth.

&quot;He pulled a dirty trick worty of a mazoku. Dropping the temperature
where he is,&quot; Xel answered, quickly getting used to the cold air.

&quot;B-b-but what ab-bout Ser?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think he&#39;d let her freeze, but this does complicate things a
little.&quot; Figuring they stood a better chance if they could feel their
hands, Xel formed barriers around the others, blocking out the bitter
cold.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Xel nodded absently, staring at something just out of sight for
the others.

&quot;Do you see them, Xelloss-san?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re watching us, probably for our reaction to the cold.&quot; Xel
narrowed his eyes.

&quot;Well, they know that didn&#39;t work for long.&quot; The priest turned, looking
at the other slayers.

&quot;Remember, we&#39;re just trying to free Ser-chan, defeating them will have
to wait.&quot;

&quot;Hai, time is of the utmost importance, especially Zelgadis-san&#39;s time!&quot;
The small group spread out as they had planned, Lina and Amelia preparing
several Lighting spells, the Sword of Light glowing brightly, and the
jewel of Xel&#39;s staff emitting a similar light.

Zur watched them all, a slow smile spreading across his face. &quot;Seraya,
it&#39;s time to finish what you started.&quot; She nodded and started for Xel, a
white energy orb glowing between her hands. Xel smiled brightly.

&quot;Why Ser-chan, coming for me? I&#39;m flattered.&quot; Lina, Amelia and Gourry
prepared themselves. Once Ser had charged her energy they would attack
with every light they could. After that... Xel hadn&#39;t been clear.

The moment came, Ser had almost finished her spell and Zur&#39;s
concentration was strongest on her. At that moment, Granite called out in
warning as nearly a hundred light orbs flew towards them, Gourry charging
with the Sword of Light raised.

Zur glanced towards the new threat and that was what Xel was waiting for.
He swung his staff and another orb of energy flew towards the shadow. Zur
looked back just as it struck him and shattered his concentration, his
spells on Ser being broken.

She froze for a moment, life reentering her eyes, then she shivered and
collapsed curled up to the ground, the white orb floating above her
forgotten. Xel blurred as he rushed towards Ser, scooped her up and waved
his hand all in one motion, he and the others teleporting back to
Sailoon.

The remaining light spells were swiftly dealt with, then Zur turned on
Granite. He growled lowly, his eyes glowing angrily. &quot;How did they do
that?! That spell was unbreakable!&quot; Granite cringed under his Lord&#39;s
accusations. There had been too many orbs of light and he hadn&#39;t been
able to defend his master. &quot;And you! You just stood there!&quot; Zur glared
down at his minion. Knowing better than to disagree, Granite kept his
mouth shut.

&quot;You&#39;re a waste of my time and power.&quot; Granite looked up in shock, then
fear as a red barrier formed around him.

&quot;Wait, my Lord! Please, give me another chance, I beg you!&quot; Zur waved his
hand and the barrier imploded into nothing, the figure formerally known
as Granite reabsorbed completely.

&quot;Now... to get Seraya back...&quot;
