<h1>Not Right For You</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/anji.html">Anji Michalski</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Lina paced the floor nervously, repeating the rehearsed speech that
she had spent all week composing. This time she would say it. No
matter how much it broke her heart to, this had to end. She was
brushing her hair back behind her ears when she was startled by the
feeling of two arms sliding around her waist, two hands linking across
her stomach, soft hair brushing against her ear, and warm lips and
breath caressing the side of her neck.

Lina gulped, very aware of how her neck moved when she did so. &quot;We
have to talk.&quot; There was no answer, but the head moved
inquisitively. &quot;We can&#39;t do this anymore.&quot; The grip around her waist
loosened, and then tightened even more then before, the breathing
growing more audible. &quot;Look, I don&#39;t want to hurt you. But this has
got to end...&quot; The grip was so tight that she could barely breathe
now. &quot;Please, this isn&#39;t love!&quot; Lina gasped a sigh of relief as the
hands left her waist. &quot;I know you think you love me, but you
don&#39;t. You don&#39;t know love yet. You&#39;re far too innocent. All you have
for me is an infatuation, something born out of respect for me, for my
power.&quot;  Lina grabbed the hand before it could wipe away her lover&#39;s
tears, and held it tightly. &quot;Please, you don&#39;t know who I am. You
wouldn&#39;t love who I am. You love the image of me, the savior of
man-kind on multiple occasions. You have to look at me
objectively. You know I&#39;m a cold hearted killer, you know I do massive
property damage without remorse, you know I&#39;m not right for you.&quot; Lina
turned and let her lover&#39;s head bury itself against her
shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s better this way, and you know it. As much as I&#39;ve
loved every minute we&#39;ve been together, this is only going to end up
hurting us both if we don&#39;t end it now.&quot; She held her lover&#39;s shoulder
and peered into the dark eyes. &quot;You know I&#39;m right, don&#39;t you?&quot; She
watched the dark head bob. &quot;Thank you... and I&#39;m sorry... Amelia.&quot;
