	Lina tossed in her sleep restlessly not able to relax enough
to fall into sleep. Her mind was aglow with thoughts and worries, she
was getting carried away and she knew it she was obsessed and couldn&#39;t
control her feelings or desires any longer.

	Lina sighed as she wrapped the sheet around her petite body
and made her way to the window to gaze out into the midnight sky. A
pair of arms encircled her waist pulling her into a warm embrace.

	&quot;Moonlight suits you well dear Lina,&quot; Sylphiel whispered hotly
in her ear. She nuzzled her face into Lina&#39;s neck kissing her softly
as her hands caressed down Lina&#39;s body.

	&quot;Sylphiel,&quot; Lina moaned as her friend and newfound lover
pleased her in a way only she could. Lina took Sylphiel&#39;s hand in her
own and guided it down to her sex, her fingers entwined with her
lovers as Sylphiel slowly entered Lina.

	Her fingers rhythmically pumped into Lina&#39;s pussy, working her
fingers deep into her lover until her legs went weak and she collapsed
into Sylphiel&#39;s waiting arms, breathing heavily her eyes opened and
closed in ecstasy and exhaustion.

	She turned to face her unseen lover, her eyes filled with the
telltale glaze on intense of pleasure. &quot;Lina dear, come back to bed my
love&quot; Sylphiel spoke softly.

	Lina let the sheet covering her naked body fall to the floor
and encircled her arms around her dark haired lover, as took the
offensive in their love making as she took the offensive in battle.

	She raised Sylphiel&#39;s beautiful face to hers and kissed her
softly her tongue exploring the secrets her friend had to offer; Lina
pushed Sylphiel back onto the bed and gently climbed atop of her and
resumed her soft kisses.

	Her body cried out in pleasure as she touched Sylphiel, never
in her sixteen years of life had she felt this way her mind was
reeling her blood was boiling and her body was reacting to Sylphiel
like it never had before.

	Sylphiel pulled Lina down to her pressing her ample breasts
against Lina&#39;s, her hips rose to grind against her lovers. She was
moaning in pleasure now her breath coming in ragged gasps.

	&quot;Lina I need you inside me&quot; Sylphiel cooed softly, she grasped
Lina&#39;s hand and guided her fingers down to her pussy; Lina smiled and
slowly rubbed her hands across her silken mound.

	Lina withdrew her hand from Sylphiel&#39;s now wet pussy, she
licked one finger clean before offering the rest to Sylphiel who took
Lina&#39;s hand and sucked her fingers dry before pulling Lina down and
kissing her hard.

	She felt Lina break the kiss and soon after felt her legs
being spread wide, she looked down and saw Lina&#39;s smiling face from
between her legs, the next thing she felt was an intense bolt of
pleasure that started at her clit and shot through her body, as it
reached her mouth she let loose a scream she knew the entire inn must
of heard.

	She was trashing around wildly as Lina continued to attack her
clit with her tongue, Lina placed her mouth around her clit and sucked
hard causing her lover to cry out even louder.

	Her orgasm was fast and shot through her entire body as if a
thousand pins were piercing her skin at once, she thrust her hips up
to grind against Lina&#39;s mouth. Lina was still licking her as a second
orgasm washed over her and her body arched as waves of extreme
pleasure washed over her.

	Her eyes closed and blackness engulphed her, the next thing
she felt was Lina laying next to her stroking her skin softly and
gently tracing her figure.

	&quot;Its about time you woke up, I see I was too much for you yet
again, like I always say never underestimate Lina Inverse&quot; Lina said
happily as she kissed Sylphiel.

	&quot;Dear Lina you&#39;re never too much for me, I could never get
enough of you&quot; Sylphiel said with tears in her eyes, &quot;but dear
Lina... What are we going to do about the others? I don&#39;t think they
will object, but we need to tell them.&quot;

	Lina thought for a while before replying &quot;I honestly don&#39;t
know what to think; I do know I love you and don&#39;t want to hide that
love... not from Gourry or any of the others.&quot;

	Sylphiel looked pained for a moment after the mention of
Gourry&#39;s name.  &quot;You love him still don&#39;t you? Lina asked.

	Sylphiel turned to face her, &quot;Yes but I love you as well Lina
dear, I don&#39;t know what to think, I don&#39;t ever want to lose you but at
the same time I also love someone else.&quot;

	&quot;I know Sylphiel I know exactly how you feel, I can&#39;t help but
love that idiot no matter how stupid he is,&quot; Lina mused.

	The two lovers lay there for some while their bodies entwined
with a sensuous wrap of moonlight around them. Sylphiel moved her
hands around to cup Lina&#39;s breasts her hands gently squeezed as her
thumbs pressed on her nipples eliciting a moan from Lina.

	Sylphiel moved her hands down lower, her fingers touching and
rubbing Lina&#39;s sex; her mouth was now on Lina&#39;s breast licking her
softly as her fingers slipped over her lover&#39;s mound.

	Sylphiel pumped her fingers in and out of Lina like a machine;
she could feel her lover getting very wet and brought her fingers up
to Lina&#39;s mouth.  Lina&#39;s tongue came out to taste a sample of what she
was offering.

	Sylphiel resumed her masturbation but on herself this time
getting her fingers wet once again she brought them up to Lina&#39;s mouth
and let her taste her this time. &quot;You taste much better than I do
Sylphiel,&quot; Lina said with a giggle.

	&quot;Oh I don&#39;t know Lina I happen to love your taste,&quot; Sylphiel
said with a wink as she lowered her head down between Lina&#39;s legs and
licked at Lina&#39;s pussy, slowly slipping her tongue in and out of her
red-haired lover.

	Moans of sheer pleasure escaped Lina&#39;s lips as Sylphiel&#39;s
talented tongue brought her close to an orgasm. Sylphiel flicked her
tongue over Lina&#39;s clit causing her to shake and raise her hips up to
meet her mouth.

	With a gleam of love and lust in her eyes Sylphiel sucked
Lina&#39;s clit into her mouth and brought her hand up to slip two fingers
inside Lina&#39;s pussy.  The sensation was too much for Lina to take, and
she exploded into a mind blowing orgasm.

	Lina&#39;s legs clamped down upon Sylphiel&#39;s head as she
came. Sylphiel&#39;s tongue didn&#39;t stop and sent Lina over the edge into
another orgasm before she relaxed and feel into the haze of post
orgasmic bliss.

	Sylphiel crawled up to lay beside Lina and kissed her letting
Lina taste herself yet again. Suddenly Sylphiel&#39;s eyes filled with
tears, Lina looked at her quizzically but Sylphiel had no answer.

	Lina caressed her hand across Sylphiel&#39;s face wiping the tears
away; she kissed her deeply as she embraced her lover. The last thing
Lina saw before she fell asleep was Sylphiel&#39;s calm serene sleeping
face as gentle and beautiful as the day they met.
