<a href="../slayers/her-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><p align=center>In this drabble, Sheifyl is thinking of Lina.</p>

<P align=center>Yes, Sheifyl.<BR>
It's not as zarbi as it sounds, though.  At least, I don't think so.
<BR>So here's my explanation, line-by-line:</p>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 border=1>
<tr>
<th>Text</th>
<th>Explanation</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>She is the kind of person you can't help but love.</td> 
<td>As far as I'm concerned, this screams Lina.  Once she makes friends, they <I>do</i> love her, and are very loyal.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>I wonder what it would be like, to draw people to yourself like that...?</td>
<td>Sheifyl seems to be rather timid and shy; therefore, she likely has never drawn people to her quite like the flamboyant Lina Inverse.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>I don't suppose it matters; I don't really <i>want</i> to draw others like she does, just a select few.</td>
<td>One of these select few, of course, would be Gourry.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Like her.</td>
<td>Like Lina.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>It was a stunning revelation, the moment that I realised the truth.</td>
<td>Well, it would've been, ne?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><p>It went against all the plans I'd had, against even what I thought about myself.</td>
<td>It seemed obvious Shiefyl wanted a future with Gourry, that she loved Gourry.  But what if Gourry was more a first love, the kind you never really stop loving, but don't necessarily love with all your heart?</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>I'm not entirely sure <I>how</i> it happened, but it did.</td>
<td>Love is chaotic, after all...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>When I saw her lying on the ground, bleeding, I knew with certainity that I loved her.</td>
<td>When Lina and Company fought Kopii Rezo, Lina took a hit for Sheifyl.  Sheifyl was really upset; couldn't that have been from love, not guilt?</td>
</tr>
