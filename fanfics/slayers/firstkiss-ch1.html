&quot;Sylphiel?!&quot; Lina shouted rather loudly in Gourry&#39;s ear, to his
annoyance and pain. &quot;Hands off girly girl; he doesn&#39;t want anything to
do with you,&quot; she said as she clutched onto Gourry&#39;s arm like a leech.

&quot;Miss Lina, I knew Gourry-sama first and I think I know what he wants
more than you do,&quot; Sylphiel retorted as she clutched Gourry&#39;s other
arm pulling him in her direction.

&quot;Umm... can I go now?&quot; Gourry asked meekly as the two girls continued
their tirade.

&quot;Shut up jellyfish brains; this doesn&#39;t concern you!&quot; Lina shouted as
she continued to pull on his left arm.

&quot;Miss Lina, how dare you talk to Gourry-sama like that!&quot;

&quot;Actually Sylphiel that&#39;s ok...&quot;

&quot;Oh Gourry-sama, please stay out of this,&quot; Sylphiel begged.

&quot;But Sylphiel...&quot; Gourry started.

&quot;GOURRY JUST SHUT UP!&quot; both Lina and Sylphiel shouted at the same time
causing Gourry to sweatdrop.

&quot;Look miss goody two-shoes, if Gourry wanted you he would have told
you right? And has he?&quot; Lina smiled evilly.

&quot;Well no but...&quot; Sylphiel mewed.

&quot;Well that settles it then. Gourry is mine and you can just go right
on back to where ever you crawled out of.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care that Gourry-sama hasn&#39;t told me. He likes me, I love
him, and that&#39;s all that counts right Gourry-sama?&quot; Sylphiel asked.

&quot;Well I guess so but...&quot; Gourry started.

&quot;Shut up you idiot!&quot; Lina shouted as her fist came crashing down on
his head crushing him down to the ground.

*Damn that Sylphiel,* Lina thought. Then an idea struck her. *I know,
if I kiss Gourry right here in front of Sylphiel, she&#39;ll become so
enraged and hit me and I&#39;ll have an excuse to fireball her. I&#39;ll call
it self defense!* She grinned evilly looking over at her rival,
knowing that she would be rid of her soon.

*Poor Gourry-sama. Lina is so mean to him; why does she want him so
much if she is only going to mistreat him...* Sylphiel thought as she
continued to try to free Gourry from Lina&#39;s evil clutches.

Just then Sylphiel had an epiphany. *That&#39;s it! If I kiss Gourry-sama
right here in front of Lina, she will be so enraged she will attack me
and Gourry-sama will come to my defense and rescue me!* Sylphiel
smiled and blushed softly as she thought of what she was about to do.

Gourry, being totally clueless, just wanted to get out of there before
Lina lost her temper.

&quot;Oh Gourry...&quot; Lina said as she reached up to grab Gourry&#39;s face and
pull him down into a kiss. Gourry, being a great swordsman, was able
to react quickly. He saw the look on Lina&#39;s face and it scared him
more than anything he had ever seen in his entire life. He had heard
of the kiss of death and he thought that&#39;s what was happening.

Lina closed her eyes and boosted herself up on her tiptoes to get a
better shot at kissing Gourry. Sylphiel, on the other side of Gourry,
was doing the exact same thing. Leaning in to kiss Gourry, she
suddenly wrapped her arms around him.

Gourry on the other hand never received either kiss. One second he was
sandwiched between the two fighting girls; the next he had slipped out
and was standing across the way from Lina and Sylphiel.

Lina and Sylphiel both collapsed into each other&#39;s arms and embraced
into a passionate kiss that made Gourry facefault.

Lina felt something was amiss; wasn&#39;t Gourry supposed to be taller,
and since when did he grow breasts? Her eyes snapped open and stared
into Sylphiel&#39;s purple eyes.

&quot;What the Hell??????!!!!!!&quot; Lina yelled as loud as she could after
realizing she had just kissed Sylphiel.

Sylphiel on the other hand had fainted outright after seeing that the
object of her affections for Gourry had turned out to be Lina instead.

&quot;Ecchi, hentai! Oh this is just great, I just kissed a girl, I&#39;m a
pervert! Omygod omygod omygod!&quot; Lina yelled as she ran to the river to
wash her mouth out, all the while screaming &quot;ecchi&quot; and &quot;hentai&quot;.

Gourry, not being able to take the sight of Lina and Sylphiel kissing,
had a huge nosebleed and fell over backwards.

A lone figure hidden high up in the trees smiled and laughed as he viewed
the very humorous turn of events that he had just created.

&quot;I love it when a plan comes together,&quot; Xellos said as he smiled and
vanished.

End

[Editor&#39;s Note: An interesting premise. I wonder what would happen in
the aftermath; how would Lina react, and how would Sylphiel
react. Time and inspiration permitting, I may decide to write a sequel
to this someday.]
