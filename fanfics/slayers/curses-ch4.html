<a href="../slayers/curses-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>In her castle, Zelas was waiting for her General Priest to return. She
was also wondering how that girl he had found a few weeks ago was.
&lt;Seraya, wasn&#39;t it?&gt;

Xelloss reappeared on Wolf Pack Island and, without any warning, released
a huge wave of energy, thousands of lower mazoku being incinerated. The
Beastmaster saw this enormous display of rage and simply raised an
eyebrow. &lt;Hmm, seems Xelloss&#39;s upset about something.&gt;

After torching a few more mazoku that tried to feed off his emotions, Xel
reappeared in the castle, most of his anger and frustration cooled.
&quot;What&#39;s happened this time, Xelloss?&quot;

He bowed to her then straightened, leaning on his staff. &quot;Sore wa himitsu
desu, Juuou-sama.&quot; She chuckled softly.

&quot;I&#39;ve taught you too well, but you should know better than to keep
secrets from me.&quot; Before he could respond, Zelas dug into his memories,
reliving the past half hour as if she had been there. Knowing that
resisting would be considered very bad, Xelloss watched her calmly with
his eyes closed, letting her see all he had seen, feel all he had felt.

After the scene played out, Zelas released her priest from her mental
grasp and nodded thoughtfully. &quot;I see. You think Lina-san tried to take
Seraya-san from you?&quot;

&quot;Hai, Juuou-sama. It must be understandable why I was angry.&quot; Zelas
watched him, gazing at his eyelids.

&quot;I don&#39;t believe Lina-san did this of her own will. Did you sense it,
Xelloss?&quot; He frowned to himself, the light smile still on his physical
face.

&quot;What was there to sense? She did it on her own.&quot; Zelas smiled warmly and
shook her head, not saying anything more. &quot;Juuou-sama, what do y - &quot; He
blinked his eyes open in surprise, finding himself teleported out of the
castle and back near the slayers&#39; camp. &quot;Very well, then,&quot; he whispered
to himself, closing his eyes again. &quot;I will watch some more.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;My Lord, the spell was a success. Lina Inverse will be simple to defeat
this time tomorrow,&quot; the shadowy figure reported, kneeled down before its
superior.

&quot;Yes, I am well aware of that, Granite. However, I still sense something
in the back of your mind. What&#39;s happened this time?&quot; Granite hesitated a
moment, then spoke his concerns.

&quot;It&#39;s about the other girl, Lord Zur. She was able to sense my presense
even though it shouldn&#39;t have been possible.&quot; Zur nodded slowly.

&quot;So you are saying she is much more powerful than she seems.&quot;

&quot;It appears so, my Lord.&quot; Zur looked through the dimensional window at
the small traveling group, still asleep even though the sun had just
started rising.

&quot;Well then, a slight change in plans.. before we destroy Lina Inverse, we
will take her friend as well.&quot;

&quot;Do you wish me to go retrieve her now, Lord?&quot;

&quot;No, wait until I give the order.&quot; Granite nodded and stood up again.

&quot;Of course, Lord Zur.&quot; He bowed then disappeared across the dimensions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first peeks of the sunrise had started to bathe the area in light,
and Lina and Ser were still asleep together. The guys, however...

&quot;I still can&#39;t believe it, Lina... can I even call it that? ... she raped
Seraya...&quot; Gourry was in the same state of shock he had been in a couple
hours ago, brain still working on taking in what he had seen.

&quot;She&#39;s a girl... and she&#39;s a girl.... but she&#39;s a girl too...&quot; The
swordsman tried amazingly hard to make sense of it, but the only result
was his fainting.

Zel sighed quietly, wondering what to do. &lt;When they wake it, it&#39;ll be
very awkward...&gt;
