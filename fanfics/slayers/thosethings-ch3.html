<h3>Everything's Crazy</h3>

<div class="black">
<p><span class="xel">"Close your mouth, Zel-kun, you'll catch flies."
</span>
<p><span class="zel">"......"
</span>
<p><span class="xel">"What <I>is</i> the matter?  You look as if you've
seen a ghost."
</span>
<p><span class="zel">".....that."
</span>
<p><span class="xel">"What?....oh, <I>that</i>."
</span>
<p><span class="zel">"And I was worried about <I>you</i>..."
</span>
<p><span class="xel">"...being competition..."
</span>
<BR>&nbsp;
<p><span class="lina">"Look, there's the other happy couple."
</span>
<p><span class="syl">"Perhaps we could...congratulate them, as
well, Lina-sama?"
</span>
<p><span class="lina">"Great idea, Shilfiel!  Hey, guys!  Over here!"
</span>
<BR>&nbsp;
<p><span class="zel">"Did Lina just call for us to go over there?"
</span>
<p><I>Nod</i>.  <span class="xel">"Apparantly so."
</span>
<p><span class="zel">"Great."
</span>
<BR>&nbsp;
<p><span class="lina">"Hi, Zel, Xelloss!"
</span>
<p><span class="zel">"...hello, Lina."
</span>
<p><span class="xel">"Hello, Lina-chan."
</span>
<p><span class="syl">"We just wanted to thank you!"
</span>
<p><span class="lina">"Yeah."
</span>
<p><span class="zel">"Thanks us?"
</span>
<p><span class="xel">"Whatever for?"
</span>
<p><span class="lina">"Well, if I hadn't seen you two together the
other day, Shilfiel and I might never have 
become a real couple."
</span>
<p><span class="zel">"....."
</span>
<p><span class="xel">"What do you mean, "together," Lina-chan?"
</span>
<p><I>Snicker</i>.  <span class="lina">"When Zel was on top of you, and you
two claimed it was 'nothing,' I figured it out.  
Well, you don't have to hide it anymore."
</span>
<p><I>Spluttering</i>. <span class="zel">"Wha-WHAT?"
</span>
<p><span class="syl">"It's all right, Zelgadiss-san.  Lina-sama and
I understand why you two hid your relationship."
</span>
<p><span class="xel">"To what 'relationship' do you refer?"
</span>
<p><span class="lina">"Don't be obtuse, Xelloss.  So just when <I>did</i>
you and Zel fall for each other?  It was one of
those love/hate things, ne?"
</span>
<p><span class="xel">"....."
</span>
<p><span class="zel">"....."
</span>
<p><span class="lina">"Well, it was nice talking to you, but Shilfiel and
I have a date.  See ya!"
</span>
<BR>&nbsp;
<p><span class="zel">"...is it just me, or has everything gone completely
crazy?"
</span>
<p><span class="xel">"It's not just you."
</span>
<BR>&nbsp;
<p><span class="syl">"They seemed awfully shy, didn't they, Lina-sama?"
</span>
<p><I>Shrug.</i>  <span class="lina">"Oh, well.  They probably just need to get
used to the idea that we know the truth.  I know!
Tomorrow we can invite them to go on a double date
with us."
</span>
<p><span class="syl">"What a nice idea!"
</span>
<p><span class="lina">"Well, c'mon, we don't want to miss our dinner 
reservation."
</span>
<p><span class="syl">"Hai!"
