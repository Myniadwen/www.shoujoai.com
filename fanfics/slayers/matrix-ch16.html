<h1>The Slayers Matrix (part 16 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hawk.html">Hawk Shadowharper</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../slayers/matrix-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>           The flat line alarm rings in Seraya&#39;s ears as she leans 
down closer to Lina. &quot;Lina,&quot; she whispers, &quot;I&#39;m not afraid anymore. 
The Oracle told me... she told me that I would fall in love.&quot; The 
smaller woman&#39;s voice cracks but she swallows, needing to finally tell 
the redhead. &quot;She told me that that woman, the woman I loved, would be 
the One.&quot; Tears leak from her light blue eyes, starting to roll down 
her pale face. &quot;So... so you see, you can&#39;t be dead. You can&#39;t be... 
because I love you.&quot; Seraya shivers as she stares through blurry eyes 
at Lina&#39;s still face. &quot;You hear me? I love you.&quot; 
           She leans down and closes her eyes, several more tears 
rolling down her face as she presses her lips to Lina&#39;s mouth, kissing 
her lightly. Hot tears hit the redhead&#39;s face, turning the kiss 
slightly salty. A moment later, Seraya pulls back, staring at Lina&#39;s 
face. Several long seconds pass then the taller woman breathes in 
shakily, the monitor impossibly starting to beep with Lina&#39;s restarted 
heartbeat. Seraya looks up at the monitor, a smile slowly appearing on 
her face. &quot;Now get up, Lina!&quot; 

           Lina&#39;s eyes blink as life reenters them. Valgarv pauses in 
his searching for Xelloss and slowly turns back. His eyes narrow, not 
believing what he&#39;s seeing. 
           Lina stands and crosses her arms over her bloody chest. Red 
lightning seems to envelop her body and suddenly she&#39;s too bright to 
look at. Valgarv turns his head away from the flash of light then 
looks back when it dims. Lina&#39;s body is normal and instead of torn 
black clothing, she has on her own magic outfit. She slowly looks up 
at Valgarv, red eyes blazing with newfound power. 
           The Dragon growls and slashes at the human with his 
still-bloody claws. Faster than he can see, however, she draws her 
sword and holds it in the way. Waves of pain sweep over Valgarv as the 
enhanced blade cuts through his claws, the bloody ends falling 
harmlessly to the floor. The Dragon stumbles back and clutches at his 
injured hand, then looks back up at Lina. 
           Her eyes are closed. Her hands are clasped together. Her 
cape and hair are flying in an unnatural wind. She opens her eyes and 
extends her hands out towards Valgarv with a shout, &quot;Dragu Slave!&quot; A 
huge bolt of red energy explodes from her hands and zooms towards 
Valgarv. He cries out but the explosion drowns his voice, the force of 
the blast splintering the black walls of Valgarv&#39;s creation and 
shattering them, leaving Lina standing in the hotel hallway and 
Xelloss lying on his back in room 303. Valgarv is nowhere to be seen. 

           An explosion overhead wipes the smile from Seraya&#39;s face. 
She and Hawk look up as the first of the robot dragons breaks its way 
inside the main deck. &quot;Lina!&quot; She lifts both hands, one at the plug 
into Lina&#39;s neck and the other at Xel&#39;s neck. 

           Lina looks up at the ruined phone then quickly kneels 
beside Xelloss, holding a hand over his burned chest. Incredibly, the 
burns and blood all disappear in a matter of seconds, Xel&#39;s body 
restored. He grins up at her, &quot;I knew it.&quot; Lina winks back at him then 
stands again, helping the man back to his feet. They both look at the 
ruined phone. 

           Hawk cries out in pain as the robot fires, laser beam 
adding to the burns he&#39;s already received. Through sheer will he keeps 
one hand on the EMP and the other on the load button. He doesn&#39;t know 
how they&#39;ll both be able to get out fast enough. 

           As Lina looks at the phone, its shape seems to shimmer; the 
wires meld back together. The image distorts and splits into two 
images, then solidifies into two separate phones, both ringing. 

           The sentinel finishes tearing a hole wide enough for it to 
go through and swoops down, looking at Lina and Seraya. &quot;Now,&quot; she 
shouts. Hawk closes his eyes and hits the load for the incoming 
signal, waits a heartbeat then turns the EMP switch. An explosion of 
electricity rocks the Dragon Slayer as the charged pulse sweeps 
outward from the core. Seraya pulls both plugs out then throws herself 
over Lina. 
           The hovering dragon raises its arm then shudders to a stop 
when the wave of electricity shocks it. Sparks shoot from it and it 
falls limply to the ground, more clangs sounding throughout the ship 
as the other robots fail. 

           Outside the Dragon Slayer the EMP sweeps out in a sphere, 
deep rumble heard for miles. There&#39;s a bright blue flash, and then 
silence. 

           Seraya slowly lifts her head, looking over at Xelloss. He 
smiles lightly at her, purple eyes open. He then nods his head, 
indicating she look down. She does and finds herself looking into 
crimson orbs. 
           Lina lifts a hand and lightly strokes Seraya&#39;s cheek, then 
slides her touch back to the blonde&#39;s neck, gently pulling her down 
into a kiss.

           Somewhere in the darkness, a phone rings. The phone is 
answered, and the darkness comes to life as computer language appears 
and columns of numbers and symbols zoom by. An error glows at the top, 
&quot;WARNING: carrier anomaly&quot;. 
           &quot;I know you&#39;re out there. I can feel you now.&quot; Teresa F. 
Anderson. The columns shift and change, becoming just ten columns. 
They&#39;re looking for something. &quot;I know that you&#39;re afraid.&quot; The first 
column suddenly stops, showing &#39;3&#39;. It&#39;s the start of an area code for 
a phone number. &quot;You&#39;re afraid of us. You&#39;re afraid of change.&quot; A blue 
wave of energy sweeps across the screen and the columns lock up. 
&quot;System Failure&quot; glows in the middle of the screen. 
           &quot;I don&#39;t know the future. I didn&#39;t come here to tell you 
how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it&#39;s going to 
begin. I&#39;m going to hang up this phone, and then I&#39;m going to show 
these people what you don&#39;t want them to see. I&#39;m going to show them a 
world without you, a world without rules and controls, without borders 
or boundaries, a world where anything is possible. 

            &quot;Where we go from there, is a choice I leave to you.&quot; Lina 
looks at the phone, and then hangs it up. 
           She steps out of the phone booth, mage outfit getting 
several strange looks but she doesn&#39;t notice. She slowly looks around 
at the crowd, at all the people who don&#39;t know. All the people she&#39;s 
going to show the truth, in due time. She smiles and puts on her 
sunglasses, then slowly looks up at the sky. 
           &quot;Mommy! Look! That lady is flying!&quot; 
           &quot;Don&#39;t be silly dear, ladies don&#39;t fly.&quot; 
           Lina soars through the air high above the city, cape and 
hair flapping in the wind.
