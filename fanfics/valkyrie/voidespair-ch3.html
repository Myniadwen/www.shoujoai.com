After Celia had told her story, she looked to the dark Valkyrie for 
response. The day had grown long and slowly cold, for the great star 
above had ran many leagues cross its kingly sky, yet was not quite down 
for its nightly count. The two women took to resting on stones once they 
came within distance of the invisible manor, and waited there as one 
entertained the other with her history of woe. It had been many hours 
since the beginning led to the end, but too few had been spent in rest. 
Celia wondered what the Valkyrie was thinking during the silence 
following.

&quot;So... you have lost something precious to you as well,&quot; she stated 
somberly. Celia nodded.

&quot;You too?&quot; There was an emotional silence, as long and dark as the hair 
of the battle-maiden. She nudged her head down in a little nod, her eyes 
long since lost their rage. &quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;My sister,&quot; came the mumbled response. Celia gave the Valkyrie a long 
stare, quietly searching the face cast down from shame and loss. To her, 
losing somebody as close as a sister would be the same as losing many 
good friends. She picked herself up off the rock and sat very close to 
the Valkyrie, fearing neither the woman&#39;s dark appearance nor her 
possible indignation. She didn&#39;t hear any objection from the close 
contact; Valkyrie barely noticed her companion&#39;s presence, so lost was 
she in thought and regret.

She finally noticed the redhead when Celia placed her hand over her arm, 
comforting the loss in some small way. Valkyrie looked at the hand first 
and then to Celia, who tried her best to smile. Neither could, but they 
saw that as distant and strange their persons were, something as 
devastating as loss could bring them closer than any good friendship. 
Valkyrie touched Celia&#39;s face lightly, accepting the small touch and the 
presence of one in pain. She then closed her eyes, and lost herself when 
she caved into the depths of the other woman with a kiss.

They withdrew from each other, but slowly, and not sure why they had 
both done it. Celia managed a faint smile and blush, although in truth 
she knew she could never love this dark Valkyrie. The maiden warrior&#39;s 
bitter face softened into embarrassment, and a whisper of apology 
escaped as she realized she had done something improper.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; replied Celia. &quot;I think. We both just needed some way 
to pour out what little emotion we had left. There&#39;s nothing really 
wrong with that.&quot;

&quot;I suppose,&quot; managed Valkyrie, still looking shy and flushed. She sighed 
and rubbed her eyes, then took off her helmet to allow the air of 
evening to cool her head. The black bands of hair fluttered like 
miniscule waves in the breeze, the same breeze that had haunted Celia 
back in the cemetery. Celia touched the Valkyrie&#39;s shoulder as she 
observed the other woman staring into the void, much as she had. 
Reminiscing on historical agony would be the unhealthy end of them both, 
perhaps.

&quot;Are you going to be all right?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no need for a human to concern themselves with a god,&quot; replied 
Valkyrie stiffly. &quot;I thank you for your support, but ultimately, it will 
be my doing that solves it. Rest now, for the castle of our enemy has 
yet to appear.&quot;

&quot;All right. Thank you.&quot; The lady Celia was used to sleeping outdoors and 
in harsh environments, and found that a bed of leaves, soil, and dry 
pine branches made for a good bed. She removed her breastplate, greaves, 
and sword-belt, and went to sleep fairly quickly. The Valkyrie kept 
quiet vigil upon the stone, keeping one eye on the invisible part of 
land that would soon bear a castle, and the other on her resting 
companion. Slowly, her naked hand reached out for her companion&#39;s face, 
and gently stroked it into restful submission. Celia was beautiful, yet 
with a heart burdened by many things and a face accustomed not to 
happiness. Valkyrie smiled at how easily she could identify with and 
like the other woman, and caressed her until night.

&quot;Arise,&quot; commanded Valkyrie, shoving Celia&#39;s resting body until it 
stirred back into the waking world. The redhead groaned, but forced 
herself awake when she remembered what her mission was. She rubbed her 
eyes and took a few drinks from her canteen before splashing the rest on 
her face and hands. After quickly hooking her armor back, she stood up, 
stretched until she felt limber, then looked up to the dark sky, where 
something amazing waited.

It was the dread castle of Brahms, returned from the grave of moonlight. 
Celia grew tense at first, but she knew there was naught for loss. 
Venturing forth would bring her bliss no matter what the outcome, so she 
drew out her sword and kept it naked as Valkyrie preceded her. Even her 
dark maiden-leader, who had visited the damned castle many times before, 
exercised caution as she placed her foot upon the steps leading up to 
the front gate. She came upon solid ground. Celia followed, feeling the 
dread well up inside her as she went across the drawbridge and into the 
cavernous doors.

&quot;Our time is short,&quot; said Valkyrie as they came into the distinguished 
manor. &quot;We have til&#39; dawn to send the lord of this place back to the 
everlasting grave. I have explored this place thoroughly over the years, 
so I know it best. Follow me, and no matter what happens, do not stop to 
defend yourself.&quot;

&quot;Defend myself?&quot; Valkyrie glanced back briefly.

&quot;Against the creatures roaming this castle. They are weak but numerous, 
meant to stall intruders and not to kill. Even an army cannot hope to 
wade through them all and reach their master before dawn, so tis&#39; best 
to avoid them. If we are barred any further, force your way through! Do 
you understand?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot;

&quot;Then let us go.&quot; Valkyrie gave Celia a smile, not one of cruelty or 
savagery but of glee, for she could sense that victory was close at 
hand. The two spoke no more as they raced into the depths of the castle, 
for even if all of time was on their side, all words had been said and 
little more were wished.

All mortifications brought on by tragedy melted away down into puddles 
within the confines of doom. There in that castle was falsehood and 
ignorance, where clouds were born that darkened sharp eyes and dulled 
sharp senses. There, doors led to nothing, and everything led into 
nothing, and confusing turns resulted in deadly ambushes from enemies 
beyond mortal comprehension. The eerie light of the full moon taunted 
them with its fanatical speed, and darkness came into many places that 
forced loneliness upon them, wherein fiends came and deadly traps waited 
to ensnare their unaware bodies.

Brahms Castle, the very name which was fear, ate away at Celia like 
nothing ever had. Even the loss of her friends was but a whet, for the 
great devourer of wholesome doom lurked around her as if the very air 
were made of it. The entire castle was a void, sucking the marrow away 
from mortal bones until only ash remained to wither on the cursed 
ground. Valkyrie ran unaffected, but Celia was succumbing to the dark 
powers already. Every movement was a curse, and soon the weight of evil 
would crush her body to the ground.

&quot;Keep moving!&quot; barked Valkyrie, helping Celia trudge along. &quot;Whatever 
you do, do not stop moving! If you keep running, you will not be 
affected by the darkness! Evil preys on what it can catch!&quot; Celia could 
barely feel the tug of the Valkyrie&#39;s hand as she yanked her away from 
the bog, yet her words gave flight to her feet. Feeling such support 
from a stranger gave her newfound power, and slowly the area of evil 
held less control of her. Celia shivered and sped after the quick 
goddess, shedding off blankets of evil that had been piled upon her 
since her arrival.

&quot;Mortals are overcome when they arrive here,&quot; Valkyrie hissed as she 
ran. &quot;The power of evil is too great for them, and they are overtaken by 
it. Only the dead and the gods of the four worlds need not fear this 
place. I do not apologize for bringing you here, though: I gave you the 
choice.&quot;

&quot;And... for that... I am... grateful!&quot; Celia could not speak and run 
like her comrade, so she gasped and puffed out words in spite of her 
good health. The castle of Brahms was long and more treacherous than a 
war, and were the Valkyrie not there to guide her, she would have been 
lost. It seemed an age had passed before they had ascended the stairs up 
to the highest chamber, though it still remained dark out. Enemies had 
come to slow their actions, sure, but a mere snarl from Valkyrie scared 
many of them away. Those thinking themselves brave ended up damned for 
good underneath two experienced blades.

At last, the chamber that led into Brahms&#39; room had been breached, and 
no enemies save the final one obstructed them. Celia became amazed to 
find Valkyrie seemed neither tired nor out of breath from her maddening 
race, and was shamed at her own futile, mortal efforts of catching up. 
The goddess in black had showed immense kindness by waiting, even though 
painful impatience was clear on her bitter face. The goal had been 
reached, though, with hours and energies to spare, and Brahms waited for 
the black battle-maiden atop his throne of blood.

Valkyrie withdrew her sword sharply and pointed it at Brahms in silent 
challenge.

&quot;So, fate causes us to meet again, Hrist,&quot; grumbled the vampire wearily. 
Celia&#39;s eyes darted between the two dark figures--one good, one evil--as 
she was surprised. So, her real name is Hrist...

&quot;Fate will no longer be the arbiter between us,&quot; she spat. &quot;I have come 
to conclude our meetings, demon. Look well upon me, monster, for t&#39;will 
be the last merciful face you see before you are claimed by Hel!&quot; Brahms 
laughed sharply, once, as if the goddess of the Underworld would ever 
have any power over him. He stood, dwarfing both women, and stepped down 
from his dais until he was nearly level with the Valkyrie. He flinched 
not once as his neck came closer to the solid weapon of the warrior.

&quot;I see you have brought a mortal with you,&quot; he growled nonchalantly. 
Celia could not bear to look at Brahms for long, though she did stare 
long enough to assure him of her strength. Even after the darkness in 
her own life, she came unprepared for the fight with the vampire lord, 
and felt hungry for safety again. Aelia and Kashell, no doubt, would 
have been giddy for a fight.

I love a good battle.

Let&#39;s go! I&#39;ll take you all on! Come on, Celia!

&quot;I may be a mortal, but you will not find me an easy foe,&quot; she stated 
quietly. Brahms snarled out a smile and laughed.

&quot;Ah... not many mortals can remain so calm and sure of themselves in my 
presence. Hrist, do you fear your odds against me so greatly that you 
would bring mortals here?&quot;

&quot;It is not the first time you have seen them in my presence, monster,&quot; 
she snarled.

&quot;No, and I believe it won&#39;t be the last.&quot;

&quot;Believe what you will,&quot; she spat hastily, &quot;your death will soon come to 
you!&quot;

&quot;Ha!&quot; Brahms gave the smaller, less dark woman another snarl-smile, then 
cracked his monstrous knuckles as he bared his teeth. Valkyrie held 
tight to her sword with both hands, and Celia prepared herself for the 
worst. After a quick prayer to her deceased friends, she waited and 
watched to see what would happen.

Brahms struck first, slashing at Hrist with his immense paw. The 
Valkyrie lurched backwards and fell to the ground, hard.

&quot;Valkyrie!&quot; Celia stared down at the wounded woman in horror, but 
regained herself quicker than she thought possible as the floor 
shuddered from Brahms&#39; footsteps. He looked upon her as if she were 
nothing more than a meal, and crossed his arms. Celia screamed at him 
with all her might, and ran forth to avenge her lady. She thrust her 
sword deep into his belly, all the way to the hilt, and was nearly 
pulverized from the force. The blade had went through, but quickly 
eroded away into dust as the body of the undead ate away at it. Brahms 
gave Celia a nonchalant smile and slapped her hard, sending her to the 
ground. He rumbled after her and picked her up by her breastplate, 
holding her as if she were a cotton doll.

&quot;I will say this,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;You are stronger than most mortals, and 
I sense you have survived many brushes with death. Your spirit is 
normally dormant, but now I was able to glimpse at its full potential. 
Your life will be a meal which I have missed taking for many ages now.&quot; 
He hissed terribly, creating a sound so revolting that even Celia&#39;s 
screams could not cover it. His hot breath was upon her neck quickly, 
but he stopped suddenly before taking her blood.

Celia was dropped and ignored completely soon after Brahms discovered 
that Valkyrie had jammed a small shard of Celia&#39;s sword into his foot. 
The feral creature glared up at the vampire she hated, and grabbed 
control of her weapon yet again. Being immobile for a few brief moments, 
Brahms could not run from the coming onslaught.

&quot;It shall be engraved upon your very soul!&quot; sang Hrist. A ferocious 
flurry of strikes and swings came after the vampire lord, every one 
cutting his body and sending great spurts of acidic blood gushing out. 
One final thrust sent him into the air, where three divine spears of 
pure energy impaled him. They held him tight as Hrist flew up, up, up, 
spreading her dark red wings with a flash. The great spear of Nibelung 
produced from her palm, and transformed into the sacred dragon Valesti 
midair. It came down and engulfed Brahms with its flame, sending his 
body awash down to his bone.

Carefully, Valkyrie descended to the ground as her enemy recovered. She 
picked Celia up and handed her a sword, one coated in the god&#39;s ether, 
making it completely unbreakable. The redhead became flushed, even 
though Hrist still looked feral enough to rip flesh from bone. Truly, 
the goddess&#39; kindness overwhelmed her hellish appearance; the woman had 
a strong heart beneath all that murk, just as she herself did. Celia 
stood on her own, holding the new weapon in her hands. Brahms stirred 
and stood up after awhile.

&quot;You... have grown strong, Hrist!&quot; he growled. &quot;But it is not enough. I 
think it was poor of you to come here and challenge me. You do not even 
know...&quot;

&quot;The dead should be ever silent,&quot; she lashed out in return, &quot;else I 
shall cut out your tongue on my own!&quot; Brahms frowned, and found that, 
though enemies, he could still pity the Valkyrie for what she did not 
know.

&quot;Oh, Hrist... so cruel, yet so blind... Have you never asked yourself 
why Odin has never used his full power to rescue your sister? Surely you 
realize that if he desired it, the lord over all gods could have the 
third Valkyrie back whenever he wished! Yet she still remains here. Did 
you never stop to wonder how I came to have her in the first place? If 
she were of any value to Odin, he would not have allowed her capture at 
all!&quot;

&quot;SILENCE!!!&quot; she roared, nearly ready to jam her weapon into his throat. 
&quot;You are nothing more than a mere creature begging for a few short hours 
to his life! Stall your demise no longer!&quot; Brahms laughed at this, as if 
the deadly woman were a mere joke. He crossed his arms, regarding both 
beauties with wonder.

&quot;Ah... I am only trying to tell you the truth. Ask yourself those very 
questions once you have found peace, Hrist. You will quickly become an 
apostate if you think about it long enough! Hahaha!!!&quot;

&quot;You are insane,&quot; muttered Celia in disgust. Brahms frowned.

&quot;Odin is insane. He is more fearful than the most pathetic human. He 
fears the Vanir, so he makes war on them. He fears me, so he sends his 
eldest Valkyrie here. Yet he fears the power of the Valkyries as well, 
so he keeps one in suspension deliberately and keeps the other on an 
endless search after her--and the third, ah, he controls fiercely by 
locking her memories away. Ha!! Isn&#39;t it a glorious irony?! The very 
ones that serve Odin...&quot;

&quot;You will speak no longer!!!!&quot; Hrist had been pushed over the edge of 
reason and patience by Brahms&#39; words, and the fanatical sense of loyalty 
and dedication to her quest and master took over what little flame had 
been ignited by the heresy Brahms suggested. She dove after the perverse 
monster, but was quickly overtaken with a lightning-fast jab.

&quot;Who are you to make threats to me?&quot; he grumbled. &quot;You are but a mere 
pawn of your lord, who fears you and wishes not for the rebellion of his 
own to begin...&quot; Brahms spun around quickly, catching Celia off guard. 
She had tried to creep around him as he was focused on Hrist, but 
apparently the vampire lord had very good senses. He grinned once, 
showing his terrible fangs, and lurched after her.

&quot;Now, where were we?&quot;

&quot;We were about to conclude this!!!!&quot; Brahms suddenly felt an agonizing 
jolt rip down his spine as the unexpected attack from Hrist crippled 
him. The eldest Valkyrie had recovered faster than he was accustomed to, 
and hit him when he hadn&#39;t watched. He jerked around to snarl at her, 
but therein laid his next mistake. Celia, whose original intention was 
to attack the vampire from behind, found her opening and took it by 
driving her sword straight through the demon&#39;s back, until it impaled 
his heart and came out the other end.

Brahms froze, more surprised than wounded. That was unexpected.

&quot;Valkyrie!!!&quot; Hrist stood up to her full height, powerful and 
dominating, and took control of her sword. She stared up into the awed 
eyes of the dead before damning him forever.

&quot;Die.&quot; She swung her arm viciously, taking his head off at the neck in a 
single blow. The body remained upright until Celia drew out her sword, 
and crashed down to the floor where it remained. They both took a deep 
breath and cleaned their swords from the black blood that stained them. 
A very, very long silence followed, as if Valkyrie wasn&#39;t quite sure 
what to do next. Finally, after coming over the shock of actually 
killing Brahms once and for all, she blinked and whispered something to 
her partner.

&quot;Thank you...&quot; Celia smiled and bowed her head. She watched in surprise 
as Hrist leaped high into the air and claimed something that had been 
suspending there since a time unknown. When she descended, Celia gawked 
in surprise as she noticed the large crystalline object--and the woman 
held inside.

&quot;Valkyrie, what is that?&quot;

&quot;This,&quot; she identified in a peaceful voice, &quot;is a device borne of the 
darkest of magics. Nothing made by human, elf, or gods&#39; hands can 
shatter it, and no mage save the ones of ancient days can break it. Tis&#39; 
an entrapment of ultimate design, one most suiting to keep the lost, 
poor soul of my beloved sister Silmeria in.&quot;

&quot;Oh! Is this the sister you spoke of?&quot; Hrist nodded sadly. She kept her 
arm around the crystal protectively, as if her sister were already 
there, and extended the other to Celia. &quot;Take it, and we will leave this 
place. It is high time I destroy it.&quot;

&quot;All right, but what about your sister?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s nothing I can do inside this place,&quot; replied Hrist sadly. &quot;The 
darkness is too strong. We must bring her to light, then perhaps Odin 
will find a way. I cannot believe Brahms would be so pitiful in the end, 
using those false words and accusations like that to extend his life. No 
truth ever came from that monster.&quot; Celia said nothing, deciding it 
would be wisest to allow the Valkyrie to brood. She took the hand before 
her and felt herself coming away from the palace as light as a feather 
and quick as a breeze.</pre>
