<h1>Kiss of the Gods</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../valkyrie/index.html">Valkyrie Profile</a>

<pre>Lenneth turned to her left and scowled slightly, the gentle corners of 
her mouth forced down to show a sign of mild discontent. Her fingers 
were held in loose fists, and her body remained relaxed, yet in a 
state of mild tension.

&#147;Freya!&#148; She said, more inquisitive than harsh. &#147;Why have we stopped?&#148; 
She took a look from left to right to see if she had missed anything, 
and realized that her initial reaction was both prudent and 
intelligent. For as far as she could see all that lay before her was 
the rolling grass of a long, low plain. In the distance there 
mountains, but they were far from their location. The scenery was 
simply and plain, a grassy mound that was framed above by a darkening 
blue sky. It was nearly dusk, and the wind was at a slight chill. 
Lenneth frowned a little deeper, and turned back to where Freya was 
floating, just a few feet above the strands of long, waving grass.

&#147;We&#146;ve work to do!&#148; Lenneth called, this time raising an arm to signal 
her friend. The two had just come down from Valhalla, and Lenneth 
required the aide of Freya to guide her until she got accustomed to 
the world of the mortals. &#147;Midgard isn&#146;t long for existence! We must 
be hasty!&#148; For the first time Freya turned to look at the other god, 
and her face was that of mild pleasure. Her blonde hair swept out and 
waved much like the four foot long strands of grass that surrounding 
them on all sides. Her shortened skirt rippled in the wind, and her 
left leg was mildly raised, as was her normal way of &#147;standing.&#148;

&#147;Yes, we&#146;ve work to do.&#148; She stated simply, and then turned back to 
look towards the mountains. &#147;But Midgard won&#146;t die with the urgency 
you speak. There is time for it.&#148;

Lenneth raised a blue-gray eyebrow slowly. &#147;Time for what, Freya?&#148; The 
blonde took a moment before replying, and when she did she faded from 
sight, only to reappear at Lenneth&#146;s side before she spoke. The sight 
of her rippled and faded, and then the air beside Lenneth shimmered, 
as if to announce her soon reappearance. Freya let herself hover in 
the air, only inches away from where Lenneth stayed.

&#147;There is time for friendship.&#148; The blonde spoke in riddles, and 
raised a forefinger up to her lips. &#147;Lenneth, it has been long since 
last we&#146;ve met. My heart was joyful at hearing Odin&#146;s command, that 
you would go to Midgard and I would be at your side. I only wish that 
I could stay with you to assist, but sadly my attention is needed more 
in our godly kingdom.&#148;

Lenneth simply nodded, and for the first time began to understand what 
Freya spoke of. She dropped her frown and let her face return to 
stasis. She turned her head at the neck, and regarded the goddess of 
fertility once more.

&#147;You wish to consummate.&#148; The goddess of death spoke quietly, as if it 
was a question as much as it was a statement. To this Freya simply 
nodded, her focus still upon the mountain.

&#147;The Goddess of Fertility desires it, yes.&#148; The blonde goddess&#146; words 
were just as quiet as Lenneth&#146;s, and her eyes close as she spoke them. 
&#147;I have long missed the touch of other gods. The trouble in Valhalla 
has left all others occupied and worried. In a time of war there is no 
room for love, or even for the touch of passion.&#148; The arms of Freya 
dropped to her sides, and she slowly began to descend to the ground of 
Midgard. She sank down below the grass, and the sound of her boots 
slightly thumping on the dirt could be heard just barely over the rush 
of wind and the rustle of green. Lenneth quietly followed suite, and 
soon the women stood together just feet below where they once hovered 
together.

&#147;I request your time.&#148; Freya stated simply, and turned to face Lenneth 
once again. The grass swept up to nearly the breasts of both women, 
and rustled around them like a consuming ocean. Freya&#146;s fingers 
listlessly swept out and grasped at the blades, her textured skin 
coursing over the green and leaving it bent and bristled. Freya looked 
at Lenneth, who stood to face her with the same basic glance.

&#147;And I request your body.&#148; The fertility goddess made an addition to 
her last statement, and stepped forward to the Valkyrie. Though the 
errand of Valhalla was pressing on their minds, the desires of the 
flesh were a pressing matter, as well. As she stepped down upon the 
dirt Freya reached her right hand outwards, and slipped it inside the 
hand of Lenneth. Strong fingers clasped about her own, and Freya 
realized she had received an answer to her request. She stood only 
inches away from the mighty goddess of death, and smiled faintly.

&#147;Your request will be granted.&#148; Lenneth spoke in her dominating voice, 
and her fingers tightened around Freya&#146;s hand. Without another word 
between the two Lenneth reached her free hand up, and cradled the 
cheek of Freya. Eyes were closed and lips were met, with Lenneth&#146;s 
neck stretching down to press her own into her friend&#146;s. A kiss was 
formed between two gods, and on the mortal world they stood, wrapped 
in passion by a connection of flesh. Tentatively Freya reached her own 
free arm up, and slipped it around Valkyrie&#146;s armored back, pulling 
her closer and deeper into their kiss.

The tongues of gods danced together, moisture shared between lip and 
muscle, saliva seeping from the inward pores. A kiss shared between 
gods was never gentle, and the two forced lips together with passion 
and with lust, for that was what was known quite well amongst the 
sexuality of the gods. Romance was a frivolity that humans created to 
justify their desires, to the gods love was the same thing as 
unbridled sin.

Their hands parted and their arms wrapped about one another, Freya&#146;s 
meeting around Lenneth&#146;s waist and Lenneth&#146;s hands gripping the 
fertility goddess&#146; fair shoulders. Together the two shimmered in the 
darkness, and the air around them wavered as it did when Freya 
teleported. There was a subtle flash of light, and Lenneth now stood 
naked, save for her mighty feathered helmet. Freya remained clothed, 
though her body quivered as she realized the change in her friend&#146;s 
attire. The goddess of death was standing naked in a mortal field, her 
tongue deep within the mouth of another, enraptured with desire and a 
slave to the body&#146;s will.

A rustle in the leaves proceeded a soft thump, and the body of Freya 
had been thrown onto the ground. The Valkyrie was on her without any 
pause, and the kiss had not broken while they both traveled into the 
dirt. What was seconds ago a tender grip became a forceful hold, and 
Freya&#146;s eyes closed tight as she felt the hands of Lenneth squeeze her 
shoulders, with as much might as any male god could muster. Freya&#146;s 
arms dropped amongst the dirt, and the backs of her hands fell into 
the stones and dirt below. As Lenneth squeezed her shoulders with 
strength, she felt as if she could barely breathe, let alone find the 
energy to raise her arms once more.

Without regret Lenneth forcefully pulled her lips away from Freya&#146;s, 
and then let the grip on her shoulders die. She pressed her bare knees 
down into the dirt, and forced Freya&#146;s legs apart by wedging her mass 
in between her own. Valkyrie looked down at the prone body of Freya 
with a squint in her eyes, and she said nothing. Her lips were mildly 
turned down in a dominant frown, and they were covered with what 
appeared to be a translucent fluid, the saliva of the other goddess.

&#147;You requested this.&#148; Lenneth said without tenderness as she then rose 
and stepped out over Freya&#146;s body. She stood directly over the face of 
the other god before kneeling, and letting her bare sex collapse about 
the other god&#146;s lips. Her knees were driven into the dirt beside 
Freya&#146;s face, and her mound had been placed directly along the line of 
her nose. Freya needed no further beckon, and her lips trailed up in 
order to meet the offering.

Lenneth braced herself with her hands upon her knees as she let the 
other god lick her, leaning both forward and backward as her will 
deemed her to. Both of their bodies were hidden in the grass, only the 
few tall feathers in the Valkyrie&#146;s helmet could be seen above the 
rustling blades. The flesh of the plants whipped and cut at Lenneth&#146;s 
naked body, and a few sliced in such a position to cause tiny 
scratches, drawing mild drops of blood from the body of the goddess. 
The action was tiny and no more noticeable than the bite of an insect, 
but in her probed state Valkyrie could feel every blade scrape off 
every cell of skin.

Her hair was long, and a rope of blue gray rolled down along the 
length of her back, past her naked flesh and balling up on the chest 
of Freya, finding a home right between the clothed orbs she possessed. 
The body of a god knelt down harder on the face of another, and 
Lenneth moaned in a low, nearly masculine voice.

Freya herself was hard at work, using her abilities and techniques to 
pleasure the other in as good a fashion as she could. Her eyes were 
closed and her breath was held, as she licked and nibbled at the folds 
of flesh that were offered onto her face. Gray blue strands of 
Valkyrie&#146;s mound of hair tickled her chin and brushed deep into her 
cheeks, but the sensation was mild compared to that her tongue felt. 
As her muscle coursed over the folds Lenneth possessed she could feel 
the texture of the other goddess&#146; skin, every pore and imperfection, 
every ripple and every wrinkle that made the composition of the 
opening of a goddess. Moisture came from both Freya&#146;s mouth and 
Lenneth&#146;s heated sex, and before the end of one minute of attention 
Freya&#146;s mouth was ripe with the flavor of passion. Her tongue ached 
with the taste of Lenneth&#146;s insides, and her teeth quivered as a 
mixture of saliva and juice slipped down her throat and into her well. 
Her lips were sticky and she could feel liquid trailing down her 
cheeks, and her nose was pressed too far into flesh to be able to 
breathe anything more than a scent, a scent pungent with the aroma of 
a goddess&#146; passion.

Freya&#146;s arms were long reached up, and had gripped the legs of the 
Valkyrie just as soon as she had knelt. Her hands were near the 
backside of the other, and she could feel with her fragile hands just 
how powerful the other woman was. Muscles rippled along the length of 
her legs, powerful mounds in the otherwise subtle complexion Lenneth 
possessed. Freya gripped tight to the muscles surrounding her head, 
and reveled in their strength. Even for a god they seemed taught and 
intense, and for a moment she was fearful of Lenneth&#146;s release, 
curious if during her climax she would tremble and clench her legs 
together. The thought of being crushed between the thighs of the 
Valkyrie was unsettling, but just as she was fearful of it&#146;s 
possibility, she was enticed to see if it really could happen. Her 
tongue drove in further and further as she gave attention to her most 
recent lover, and before long she was at a position where she could 
constantly drive it in and out, without the nuisance of having to 
tease and prepare. Repeatedly she drove her muscle to and fro, lashing 
at the insides of the other goddess&#146; sex. Both women moaned, and the 
vibrations from Freya&#146;s lips caused just another ripple of lust.

As her tongue beat violently her fingers trailed up the muscled tone 
of Lenneth&#146;s back, and with a tight grip she located the sides of her 
hindquarters. Her right hand pressed flat against the swell of 
Lenneth&#146;s back, and her left trailed downward, looking for another 
opening to be entreated. Before long she had found it, and her 
forefinger was being tightly squeezed by the second opening the 
Valkyrie possessed. She could only manage to fit her finger inside up 
to the second knuckle, for she feared any further and the tightness 
would consume her. She contented herself to keep it where it was, and 
push hard against the walls on the inside, rolling her finger in slow 
deliberate circles, churning and turning Lenneth&#146;s body from the 
inside.

Before long the panting and moaning of Lenneth become louder, and her 
hands left her knees to reach down, and fiercely grip the long strands 
of blonde hair that hung down from Freya&#146;s head. With force Lenneth 
pulled firmly on the other woman&#146;s strand, and leaned forward on her 
knees, pushing the blunt of her body down harder upon the nose and 
tongue of the treating woman. Lenneth&#146;s body shook, and her body 
trembled with a shockwave of lust. Her entire body sweat from lust, 
and the moisture on her skin glistened as she climaxed. Her southern 
lips trembled and convulsed, and her body let loose with the fluid of 
her desire. The nectar of a god was poured to Freya&#146;s lips, which the 
other god hungrily devoured. Freya lapped at Lenneth some more, 
cleaning and adjusting the still shivering lips, and then her finger 
slowly popped away from the Valkyrie&#146;s backside. For a moment she 
waited, while Lenneth&#146;s hands released her hair and her palms pressed 
into the dirt. The Valkyrie was bent over hard, her back arched in an 
unnatural way as she panted and gasped for the few bits of air she 
could muster. Her hair swung down over her shoulder and landed near 
Freya&#146;s face, and the fertility goddess could see it was damp with 
sweat. Lenneth&#146;s sex remained placed on Freya&#146;s lips while she 
recuperated, panting and moaning in the aftermath of her climax. She 
stayed prone, bent on all fours, for nearly three minutes while she 
regained her composure and attained her breath once more. As she 
recuperated nothing was said between the two, and they both waited, 
pensive and tentative, curious as to what would happen next. Freya 
looked up to the heaving body and Lenneth, and regarded it with a 
slightly arched eye. For a god to be shaken away from her strength and 
to faltered from her stamina, it truly had to be a powerful climax, 
indeed. Freya smiled, and once again trailed her tongue along the 
glistening folds that laid before her lips. The flavor of Lenneth 
filled her mouth once more, and she took her tongue back to her mouth 
and savored the flavor, pleased.

At last Lenneth began to move, slowly at first, as if she was still 
recuperating from her falter. Within seconds she began to move more 
fluidly, and in the time it took for her to pull herself back up to 
her knees, she had regained her initial stature. Her hair once again 
swung back in the middle of her rear, and her legs no longer quivered 
with fatigue, but instead resonated with the incredible strength her 
muscles held. With a strong hand Lenneth reached down, and, while 
straddling Freya&#146;s chest, grabbed her chin in between her powerful 
fingers.

Her touch was hard but her skin was soft, and smooth against the 
slightly moistened flesh of Freya&#146;s chin. The grip held Freya&#146;s head 
in place, and moved it back and forth slowly as the Valkyrie moved her 
arm. She seemed to be sizing up the fertility goddess, examining her 
as if she were a piece of meat. After a moment&#146;s time she let her hand 
swing down to grab a fistful of Freya&#146;s hair, and tug it softly, yet 
demanding,

&#147;Up.&#148; Was all Lenneth said, while she slowly rose to her feet. As she 
rose she forced Freya to as well, as the hold on her hair became a bit 
more commanding than it had previously been. Before long Lenneth had 
pulled both of them to their feet, and now stood face-to-face with 
Freya, the blonde strands still acting as a rope within her mighty 
grip.

Freya fidgeted slightly, the result of her own excitement, and the 
curiosity of what would now happen to her. She was still garbed in her 
celestial gear, her tight fitting green outfit and her long, 
knee-length boots. Lenneth looked her up and down slowly, as if she 
was examining the outfit and the few specks of dirt it had accumulated 
during the last romp they had. The blonde strands were released, and 
Lenneth&#146;s hand dropped down to her naked waist once again.

&#147;I expected no less from the goddess of fertility.&#148; Lenneth formed a 
smile as she regarded Freya, and looked at her from beneath the rim of 
her menacing helmet. &#147;It makes me wonder whether the legends mortals 
tell of your body and actions are true.&#148;

Freya opened her mouth to reply, but Lenneth quickly silenced her by 
pressing a forefinger to her opened lips. Freya&#146;s mouth closed as the 
gesture commanded, and her words died before she could utter them. 
Lenneth slowly turned around, and gradually her naked back faced 
Freya. The long gray blue hair formed a natural barrier to the sight 
of Lenneth&#146;s naked posterior, as it&#146;s thick mass covered any area not 
publicly appropriate. Lenneth raised one of her hands to somewhere on 
her body, but from behind Freya couldn&#146;t quite tell where.

&#147;But...&#148; The Valkyrie&#146;s voice was thoughtful. &#147;What could I do for a 
goddess so versed? Surely a goddess of death is no master of passion. 
Tell me, Freya.&#148; Lenneth&#146;s hand dropped, though she still stood facing 
away from Freya.

&#147;Tell me, what is it you desire of me?&#148; The strong voice continued, 
adamant. &#147;What can my body give to yours...that you have not 
experienced countless times, and have grown bored with?&#148; Freya was 
about to speak, but the words died just as they would have if Lenneth 
had silenced her again. She thought for a moment, and realized that 
the Valkyrie had a point. As a goddess dealing with the potency of 
lust she had experienced all that could be. There was no new desire 
for Freya, nothing unique had been devised in thousands of years. It 
was all quite dull, and all bland. Surely a release could be had in 
any fashion, but at the time Freya could think of no way to make her 
own climax special. She thought of nothing, and simply dropped her 
head to glance upon the ground.

&#147;Nothing.&#148; She replied, dismally. &#147;I&#146;ve experienced all things, 
Lenneth.&#148; The Valkyrie made no motion, though a sound could be heard 
from her, the voice of mild laughter. A soft chuckle grew to a 
moderate laugh, and from there it came to a louder bellow. Lenneth 
laughed, while Freya continued to look down, dejected and now 
depressed. After a moment Lenneth finally turned, and as she did so 
the air shimmered, her armor having returned to her frame in just the 
frame of a second. Her clothing and coverings had been restored to 
place, and she looked as she did just before the two had stopped 
earlier. The grass shuffled about their waists, and Lenneth drew a 
smile to her lips.

&#147;Let me give you what you cannot give yourself.&#148; Lenneth stated 
simply, and reached a hand up to slowly brush away some strands of 
hair. &#147;And what you cannot take from a mortal.&#148; And with that Lenneth 
extended her powerful hand, and smiled almost sweetly to the other 
goddess. Freya looked up, and with hope growing in her eyes slipped 
her own hand inside of Lenneth&#146;s.

&#147;What...&#148; She began, slowly. &#147;What are you going to give me, 
Valkyrie?&#148;

Lenneth&#146;s fingers closed in tight around Freya&#146;s hand, and she stepped 
forward a little to touch the woman&#146;s other hand with hers.

&#147;Something gods don&#146;t believe in.&#148; She said the words slowly, and 
quietly. &#147;Something that we consider a folly of the humans. That&#146;s 
what I&#146;m going to give you.&#148;

Freya tilted her head, and regarded the Valkyrie with more curiosity 
than ever. Her hand trembled slightly within the powerful grip of 
Lenneth&#146;s, and she could feel her throat become dry. For reasons she 
couldn&#146;t determine, her heart felt tight within her chest. She spoke 
once more, though this time the words came out crackled and weak, the 
voice of a woman near desperation.

&#147;What...can...&#148; She swallowed hard. &#147;What can you possibly give me, 
Lenneth? That I haven&#146;t already experienced? What is it...that you can 
give me?&#148; Lenneth bowed her head a small bit, and her hands went cold 
on their place on Freya&#146;s. She took a small step forward, and lightly 
licked her lips before she spoke.

&#147;Romance.&#148; She answered quietly, and then pressed her mouth into 
Freya&#146;s. Their lips met, and two gods kissed, for the first time 
knowing what it meant...to kiss gently.
