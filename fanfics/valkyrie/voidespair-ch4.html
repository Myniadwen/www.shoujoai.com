Valkyrie carefully placed the large cage of icy glass on the ground, 
giving her trapped sister a longing stare. She touched the surface of 
the crystal, aching with terrible passion to touch and embrace the woman 
behind, yet her sense of duty tore her apart from mournful pleasures and 
set her sights on the abandoned castle. She took to the air and raised 
her arms, along with her wings, for Odin and the gods to channel their 
powers through.

&quot;Look away and cover your eyes,&quot; she instructed Celia before beginning 
the destruction. Celia did so, hoping the blast would not damage 
anything it was not meant to. Hrist then focused all her power on the 
manor, and screamed to Asgard above.

&quot;By the power of almighty Odin, All-Father and creator of the Second 
Order of Worlds, I beseech the righteous powers of Asgard to flow 
through my body and send out justice unto the heathen lands! Woe, woe, 
woe unto the inhabitants of the earth, for their doom is now!!!&quot; A 
magnified blast of vermilion-colored energy came gushing out of Valkyrie 
as her prayer was answered, and quickly slammed into Brahms&#39; Castle with 
the force of a meteor. The entire place was torn apart instantly, and as 
the blast enveloped the entire property, every single stone in the 
castle disintegrated into atomic particles. Even the very island that 
held host to the nightmarish place was scorched beyond repair, and from 
a great distance high above, one would be able to see the permanent scar 
made by the wrath of gods.

Celia kept herself hidden until Hrist flew down, touched her, and bade 
her stand. They both breathed another sigh of relief, and Valkyrie 
thanked her comrade one more time. Their focus then turned to the 
crystal barrier around Silmeria, which could not be broken by any simple 
means. Hrist glowered.

&quot;This will be a trickier task,&quot; she said. Valkyrie became silent and 
studied the crystal in hopes of coming up with a solution. Celia obeyed 
the urge to touch it, and placed her hand on the solid surface. It was 
as smooth and cool as glass, but probably thicker than diamonds. She 
heard a faint sizzling sound coming from the crystal, and noticed a wisp 
of smoke rising up. She removed her hand, astonished to find a faint 
impression was still left upon the surface, as if she had melted the 
magic away with a mere touch.

&quot;What is this?&quot; she questioned. Celia looked down at her hand and 
noticed that it still had some blood on it from the fight with 
Brahms--her blood. She scooped up a bit with her finger and pressed it 
against the glass. Smoke rose up as the cage sizzled, and a tiny hole 
was left where she had touched it. The eyes of the Valkyrie widened with 
surprise.

&quot;Of course! Human blood!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;&#145;Human blood is the catalyst of their primitive but ruinous power&#39;,&quot; 
she said, quoting one of the gods. &quot;Tis&#39; the blood of humans which the 
undead seek most; it&#39;s the source of their great strength. The blood of 
the living has incredible powers; Brahms knew this well, and used it to 
his advantage.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot;

&quot;He has known for ages that the Aesir were to battle him,&quot; said Hrist 
with an airy voice. &quot;Lady Freya and I especially, more than any of them. 
He also knows that I, the Valkyrie driven to slay him, seldom takes the 
souls of the dead as Einherjar. He must&#39;ve used this kind of magic to 
lure me and my living warriors to his realm, wherein he would take their 
lifeblood and defeat me in a stronger form. Gah, the villain! He used 
Silmeria to grow stronger!&quot;

&quot;That sounds very complicated,&quot; admitted Celia, &quot;but now that we know 
what will work on this magic, we can use it to free your sister.&quot; Celia 
looked up at the crystal, an object larger than her by about an arm&#39;s 
length, then touched her sword hilt. Valkyrie saw the subtle action and 
chewed on her lip.

&quot;Human, I know what you are planning to do. In truth, a part of me 
wishes that you did not, but ultimately, I know you desire freedom as 
much as I desire hers. We would both acquire what we desired in a single 
action, and you will have found your final good cause.&quot; Celia nodded at 
the Valkyrie and smiled. She was flattered that Hrist, a woman who 
seemed nightmarish and wicked, could have such feelings (but then again, 
she had helped fight Brahms). The redhead helped her mistress lower the 
crystal onto the ground horizontally, and carefully climbed on top of 
it.

She stood upon the surface of clear glass, taking one final look at the 
world around her. Celia recalled Lawfer&#39;s story one more time, and 
couldn&#39;t help but smile. She would not let circumstance control her any 
more. She would go and do what was right, even if it meant her death. 
Dying for justice and lofty ideals no longer seemed so foolish to her, 
now that something similar was there before her.

Do I have any regrets? she asked herself. She did, but her actions would 
remedy them.

With a fatal thrust, Celia drove her own sword into her body, buckling 
underneath the immense pressure. She felt her insides ripping apart and 
turning to flame as the foreign metal devoured them, and her face became 
pale as the blood came out from its fleshly dam. She withdrew her sword 
so nothing could hold the flow, and fainted onto the crystal&#39;s surface, 
watching with dimmed vision as her own life melted away the magical 
barrier.

&quot;Be free,&quot; she whispered, curling her fingers across the deteriorating 
surface. Hrist Valkyrie watched the bittersweet spectacle with a sad, 
somber face, not daring to close her eyes to the noble deeds of this 
unique human. She smiled at Celia as the god of death approached, and 
thanked her a final time before the life was snuffed out. Celia had 
wanted to die smiling, though her body lost all strength not two minutes 
after her selfless act. She breathed her last and was gone, just as all 
the ice melted and the third Valkyrie was freed.

Hrist carefully walked over to Silmeria, nearly ready to cry for the joy 
of her sister&#39;s release. She materialized out of her dark armor and 
scooped up the frozen Valkyrie in her arms, carefully caressing as life 
pulsed back into the blonde warrior. Silmeria stirred, so weak that she 
could barely move, and opened her eyes.

&quot;Hrist...&quot;

&quot;Yes, it is I,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m here for you, sister. I am here, and I 
am... happy.&quot;

&quot;Ah... Hri...st...&quot; Silmeria closed her eyes again, and took in her 
first deep breath in ages as her body renewed itself from her sister&#39;s 
embrace.

Hrist whispered something to her younger sister, and let her go as she 
approached Celia&#39;s body. She smiled lovingly at her greatest Einherjar, 
and touched her heart as she whispered for the woman&#39;s soul. Gently, it 
rose up from her body and entered into Hrist, where it remained for a 
time before being transferred to Valhalla. Hrist watched the soul ascend 
further, smiling brighter and brighter as the light of the dawn came 
back into the world.

Is this what death feels like? Strange... It&#39;s as comfortable as I 
thought it would be. I wonder why so many people are afraid of it. 
There&#39;s nothing to fear. I actually feel more alive now than before. 
Maybe because... I feel no more pain or sorrow...

&quot;Hey! Celia! You&#39;re really here!&quot;

Celia opened her eyes, and for a moment she swore to possessing 
lifeblood again as something akin to a pulse leaped inside her. Before 
her was Asgard, gorgeous and green with life, and further on was the 
golden-white palace of Valhalla, taller and more majestic than her own 
imagination could bear. Yet these were mere decorations meant for brief 
observation compared to the living matter before her, the people that 
had waited for her patiently. Her heart, if the dead had them, fluttered 
wildly as she saw, in a single vision, all her friends and many more 
gathered before her.

Without saying a word, Celia ran towards them and engulfed Kashell, 
Lawfer, and even Arngrim in a huge embrace.

&quot;Whoa!! Hey! I didn&#39;t expect you to do that, Celia!&quot;

&quot;Oh my...&quot;

&quot;Oh, brother...&quot; The three men each expressed their happiness to see the 
redhead (in their own way), and tried to return her hug, though their 
greeting could not compare to the strength she had wielded when, after 
what seemed like ages trapped in the slough of despondency, she had been 
freed and placed eternally in the celestial city. Kashell grinned and 
twirled her around until she laughed out loud, something that Celia had 
only done a few times in life. Lawfer kissed both her cheeks and her 
hand, as a knight would, and Arngrim...

&quot;Yeah......&quot;

&quot;Some conversationalist,&quot; muttered Celia with a smile. The gruff 
mercenary sniffed, shrugged, and walked away so closer friends could be 
with their lost lady. Celia actually squealed as her half-brother and 
close friend engaged her happily, but everything became silent when her 
gaze wandered from their happy faces to the more reserved, more patient 
smile of the Dragonian Aelia, who had stood aside content to watch. 
Kashell and Lawfer noticed where she was looking, and parted without a 
word.

&quot;Hi there,&quot; said Aelia, waving a little. &quot;You look good. Did you have 
trouble finding the place?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; admitted Celia sheepishly. &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no need to dwell on anything now,&quot; said Aelia softly. &quot;You made 
it, and we&#39;re together again, just like we promised.&quot; Celia smiled and 
nodded, then ran over to Aelia and tackled her in a desperate hug. Tears 
came from her weary but joyful eyes as she squeezed the other woman with 
all her strength, refusing to let go until she knew for certain that 
everything around her was real. Aelia returned the love and kissed the 
other woman&#39;s cheek desperately.

&quot;I&#39;m here,&quot; she whispered, so softly that only Celia heard it. &quot;I&#39;m 
here. We&#39;re all here. Welcome home.&quot;

After reuniting with all the ones she thought were lost, as well as 
acquainting herself with a few gods and goddesses of Asgard, Celia 
walked off into a field of lilies with Aelia, their hands locked and 
their pace as calm as the blowing grass beneath them. Valhalla was more 
beautiful and heavenly than she thought it would be, certainly a place 
she would love to spend all of eternity dwelling. Yet even in the midst 
of gods, the presence of her beloved friends and dear Aelia made up 
almost all the heaven; she could&#39;ve been burning in Musphelheim and 
would&#39;ve been content were her friends there. The two redheads stopped 
temporarily in the white meadow to gaze out upon all of Asgard, and 
together squeezed the other&#39;s hand.

&quot;So,&quot; said Aelia in her usual wry voice, &quot;now that you are dead, what 
would you like to do next? There really are no limits, and the war of 
Ragnarok has since been won, so really, you can amuse yourself to your 
heart&#39;s content. Tell me--what is it that you&#39;ve most wanted to do?&quot; 
Celia kept watch over Asgard for awhile as she thought, though it really 
didn&#39;t take long for her to come up with what she conceived as a guilty 
pleasure. She gently rubbed her bare thumb against Aelia&#39;s, and smiled 
shyly as she spoke.

&quot;Well... I have always wanted to fly.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not a problem,&quot; she shrugged. The Dragonian then pointed off 
into the distance, where a grove of peculiar-looking trees swayed in the 
heavenly breeze. &quot;You see those trees? Those are special trees. They 
grow what is known as Orihalcum, a very rare metal that can grant its 
bearer the ability to fly. They&#39;re abundant in Asgard, and free for our 
use just so long as we keep sowing the seeds.&quot;

&quot;Seeds?&quot; she parroted, plainly confused. &quot;Trees that bear metal as fruit 
can have seeds?&quot; Aelia laughed out loud, not meaning to insult her 
friend at all, and grinned.

&quot;Celia, this is Valhalla! As I said, anything is possible! Please, by 
all means, pick the fruit and use it to your liking!&quot;

&quot;Well, all right... but...&quot; Celia smiled shyly again, and gazed down at 
the evergreen road beneath her. Her face turned dark pink as she 
blushed. &quot;I would really like it if you accompanied me. Also...&quot; She 
closed her eyes and reached back, undoing the ribbons and pins that kept 
her hair up. Without restraint, the pale bloody strands fell freely, all 
the way down to her shoulder blades. Celia shook her head until every 
last strand was freed, and gave Aelia the most peaceful, happy, content 
smile she had.

The Dragonian blushed.

&quot;Amazing. You don&#39;t do that very often. You should keep it that way... 
and... you have no need for that armor up here, either.&quot; Celia grinned, 
still blushing a little, and took Aelia&#39;s hand as the two walked from 
the lily field to the grove of Orihalcum trees. On the way, she 
whispered one last request to her friend, one that made even Aelia 
shriek in disbelief. Celia, it seemed, certainly had some strange 
fantasies...

Hand in hand, the redheads Aelia and Celia flew over the world of 
Midgard, the wind fiercely whipping past as they plowed through the 
skies, nearly blind from the speed. To be able to fly was not something 
new to Aelia, though it had been the first time she flew as a human--or 
without a single article of clothing on. She had blushed furiously when 
Celia told her she wanted to fly in the nude, hand in hand with the 
woman she shared herself with, but the experience was all the more 
exhilarating because of it.

Aelia and even Celia, who was usually so quiet, so shy and reserved into 
her world of thought, each let out shrieks and yawps as they dove, 
ascended, and twirled around in a frenzy over the world. It was good 
that they could fly over Midgard in their spirit form--otherwise, 
several people would&#39;ve balked to see naked women hovering around like 
eagles. The thought that somebody could see them made their aerial 
joyride more exciting still, but the firm grasp they had on each other&#39;s 
palms was the greatest of all.

&quot;Oh!&quot; exclaimed Celia, slowing down significantly as she passed over a 
mountain chain. Aelia became awed as well, for before them stood the 
mighty world tree, Yggdrasil, towering as an ageless juggernaut over all 
four worlds. Its roots in Nifelheim, its peak in Asgard, the world tree 
was surprisingly difficult to see unless one knew precisely where to 
look, and only if one had the right tools. Being dead, the two hovering 
women observed it in all its glorious appearance.

&quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to...&quot;

&quot;Stand naked on top of the World Tree?&quot; suggested Aelia playfully. Celia 
smiled and nodded, and guided her friend over to the mighty sentinel. 
They reached the trunk in no time, having but the breeze as their only 
obstacle, and rose higher and higher up the tree, beyond the tallest 
mountain and even the very clouds of Midgard themselves. They broke 
through the barrier between mortal and divine, ending up back in Asgard 
to ascend directly onto the tree&#39;s very apex, wherein they landed and 
took rest.

The entirety of all creation was splayed out before them, as mighty as 
it was the day all life had been born. From their perch, the very earth 
could be seen, and Midgard, for all the villainy that had lived there, 
looked as a shining jewel from atop the Great Encompassing One. Alfheim, 
land of elves, was closer to their eyes, and greater still for the 
purity it had; Nifelheim was invisible, and Asgard before them gave them 
grandest view. Indeed, the four worlds were all before or beneath them, 
and nothing save each others&#39; presence could ever rival that view. Words 
were not needed to express it.

Celia just smiled, then grinned in happiness, before the beautiful woman 
bared before her. She placed her hands atop Aelia&#39;s smooth shoulders, 
beaming with all the love and happiness she deserved to own, and leaned 
in to nuzzle her neck. Aelia took in a deep hiss, and tilted her head 
back as the beloved other rubbed with teasing grace. Celia&#39;s hands 
slowly descended down Aelia&#39;s unbound body, causing the other girl to 
shriek and submit, right there on the high branches of Yggdrasil.

Unfortunately, their sylvan tryst broke the concentration of a certain 
irritable mage who had been hanging from the tree for some time. Her 
focus broken and her yellowy-orange hair askew, she snarled up at the 
two lovers and barked at them with all her aggravated might.

&quot;Hey, keep it down up there! Some of us are trying to obtain 
omniscience!&quot;</pre>
