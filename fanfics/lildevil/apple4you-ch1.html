<h2>a <a href="../lildevil/index.html">Stray Little Devil</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/thornonarose.html">Thorn on a Rose</a><br> </h2>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There was no school for the 
day because it was the day after a series of tests given to the devil 
interns. Those tests will determine if the intern is ready to become 
a full-fledged devil and Pam was so anxious to know the results that 
she was annoying her roommate Raim. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“What if I don&#39;t pass?! I&#39;ll 
have to go through school all over again and then it will be another 
four years before I can turn human again!!”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Kansai-dialect speaking Raim 
has had it up to her single devil forehead horn with Pam&#39;s pacing and 
fretting.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“PAMUCHI! Either stop moving 
around and be quiet or get out! I&#39;m trying to sleep! I stayed up all 
week studying for those exams and now I just want to rest!”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Crimson eyes filled with tears 
as they locked onto Raim&#39;s dark green eyes. “But, but!”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“THAT&#39;S IT!!”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Raim pulled herself up and 
out of the bed and grabbed a hold of Pam&#39;s collar on her sailor suit 
and threw her out the open door, slamming it shut the moment she let 
go. Pam landed face first into the wall opposite their dorm door.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Owww!”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Moving her hands up to rub 
her sore nose, Pam noticed something strange…she couldn&#39;t move her 
face away from the wall! </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Hunh?!” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam then kept trying to push 
herself away from the wall, first with just her hands pressed against 
the cold stones, then with her feet added to the force of her struggle. </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Uhn! Grunt! Arrgh!” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">After a few minutes, Pam decided 
to rest because her head was beginning to hurt from all the tugging. 
So that&#39;s how Vine found her; just kneeling there after attempting yet 
again for the last half hour to free herself from the gray wall.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Pam! What&#39;s wrong? Why are 
you over there?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam couldn&#39;t turn to look at 
the owner of the soft, sweet voice but since it belonged to her other 
roommate, she recognized who it was standing beside her.  <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Vine, I can&#39;t get away from 
the wall and my head hurts from trying to for so long. Can you help 
me please?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Soft, cool hands caressed Pam&#39;s 
forehead, easing the ache and heat temporarily. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Of course Pam. Let me see 
why you&#39;re stuck to the stones.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dexterous fingers shifted through 
bright red hair until they found the base of Pam&#39;s devil horns. Once 
very small stubs, they were now much bigger and longer from her growth 
over the years. Not to mention tough! They curved straight up from her 
head then bent to point straight ahead almost like a bull&#39;s except they 
are spiraled horns and closer to her head. Vine followed the ivory colored 
horns until they stopped short at the stone wall. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Just like the pureblooded devil 
thought, Pam&#39;s horns were stuck inside the wall as if rammed into it.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Pam, it&#39;s your horns. They&#39;re 
what&#39;s stuck in the wall and not allowing you to move away.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Giving a small tug to both 
pieces of bone, Vine found out they were in pretty deep. No wonder Pam 
had a headache!</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“How did this happen Pam?”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So Pam told Vine about how 
she was really worried about the intern exams and Raim got annoyed enough 
to send her flying without the benefit of wings out the door towards 
the opposite wall. Vine giggled a little at the antics of her two volatile 
and odd roommates/friends.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Oh Pam, I&#39;m sure you did 
just fine. With all the studying and cramming we did I&#39;m sure all three 
of us passed.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Really?” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Vine just smiled and crouched 
down to look into Pam&#39;s blood red eyes with her deep brown ones. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Yes, really.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam smiled back as best she 
could and decided not to worry anymore.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Now we just have to get 
you loose. I&#39;ll go get Raim to help.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A few seconds later, Vine came 
back out into the hall with an irate Raim.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Why didn&#39;t you call out 
that you were stuck Pamuchi?!”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Um…I didn&#39;t want to disturb 
your rest or annoy you anymore Raim.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A quick whap across her rear 
with a whip-like tail caused Pam to yelp in surprise.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Stupid! I wouldn&#39;t have 
not helped! Next time something like this happens and I&#39;m near, let 
me know!”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The lime haired girl devil 
leaned down and blushed a little when she caught Pam&#39;s eyes. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“It&#39;s what friends do, right?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam smiled brilliantly but 
before she could acknowledge Raim&#39;s claim of friendship, Raim and Vine 
each grabbed hold of a horn and pulled!</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Pull!”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">All three devil interns flew 
backward when Pam&#39;s horns were released from the wall to land in a heap 
against the thick wooden door leading into their rooms.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Oww…” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam rubbed her aching head 
and horns while Vine and Raim dusted themselves off. Black-haired Vine 
was the one to ask if Pam was ok.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Maybe you should go see 
the doctor Pam.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">One crimson eye opened to glance 
at her gentle friend. “Why not the school nurse?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Raim answered. “She&#39;s got 
the week off to go visit family so you&#39;ll have to go to Urk and find 
one of the doctors in the Guild.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Or if you can&#39;t afford one 
of the devil doctors Pam, one of the volunteer angels in the Chapel 
might consent to see and help you.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Raim snorted at Vine. “I 
doubt that! The Law of Conservation of Luck would be in full force if 
one of the angels helped Pam out.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Vine sighed and crossed her 
arms over her abdomen. “You might be right Raim. No angel would really 
be willing to suffer some bad luck by helping Pam.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Worried brown eyes turned to 
Pam and gentle hands reached out to try and sooth some of the pain away 
in Pam&#39;s head. “Do you have enough money for one of the Guild doctors 
Pam?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Humming at the feeling of Vine&#39;s 
cool fingers against her too hot skin, Pam nodded slightly not wanting 
to lose contact. “I do. Do either of you want to come with me?”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Raim put her hands on her hips 
and looked down for a second thinking about obligations she might have 
today before looking back up and shaking her head. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Sorry Pamuchi. I promised 
Lizyerra I&#39;d help her with her class schedule for the new interns she 
has to teach.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Vine ceased her massage and 
got up, pulling Pam with her. “I&#39;m sorry but I have to meet with Grandfather 
for lunch. Will you be ok?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam cast her gaze down for 
a moment wishing her friends could go with her to the doctor&#39;s since 
she&#39;s never had to visit one outside of the school before. However, 
Pam nodded and happily hugged her friends before grabbing her money 
pouch from inside their room and heading towards the bus stop.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I&#39;ll be alright! Don&#39;t worry. 
I will see you two later tonight!”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And Pam was off. Soon enough 
the fast paced bus stopped and Pam got on. When the driver called out, 
“Our next stop is the &#39;Guild Investigation Headquarters&#39; Pam called 
back for that one. Having gone to the headquarters to find part-time 
jobs over the course of the years, Pam knew her way from there to the 
Guild business districts were she would find the doctors.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Getting down from the bus, 
Pam felt dizzy and almost fell to the ground. “I better hurry.” 
Passing the bulletin boards where the intern part-time job ads were 
posted, the young woman devil pushed open the door that led to the business 
districts in Urk and went through.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Much of her journey was a blur 
of avoiding running into anyone and trying to locate a doctor&#39;s office 
since her headache seems to have increased in pain and the constant 
throbbing was making her faint and staggery. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Stopping for a moment to catch 
her breath and try to focus, Pam found herself in the area where the 
ever fought over boundary line between the powers of the Guild and Chapel 
resides. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I must be near Restaurant 
Ziggurat. Maybe Mr. Manager can help me find a doctor.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam was actually very close 
to the restaurant she used to work at and doing her best to get there 
when she was knocked into the wall of a nearby building by some young 
spirits who were chasing each other and not watching where they were 
going or who they were bumping into.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam&#39;s struggle to stay conscious 
lasted all of 10 seconds before she passed out. Just long enough time 
to catch sight of white, almost transparent wings and worried deep violet 
eyes. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“…Lin…fa…”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Next thing the devil girl becomes 
aware of is lying on a soft surface and white walls around her. Regaining 
her equilibrium and senses, Pam noticed voices coming through a door 
on her left. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“She&#39;ll be fine…horns…hurt…healing…a 
week…”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">That voice she didn&#39;t recognize 
but the one that answered was Mr. Manager&#39;s deeper voice. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“How much…leave…Pam…rest…” </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam quickly fell back into 
oblivion from the amount of energy she didn&#39;t really have that it took 
to stay awake, unaware of the pair of violet eyes belonging to a young 
woman sitting in the chair in the right corner of the room watching 
over Pam. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The owner of those eyes walked 
over to pull up the sheet around Pam to keep her warm and to change 
the cool cloth on her fore head with a freshly dampened one. As she 
was going back to her seat, the angel reviewed what she had overheard 
between the doctor and the manager of Restaurant Ziggurat. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam would be fine; she just 
had a very bad headache and high fever. Linfa tuned out the voices after 
that, feeling relieved that it wasn&#39;t anything life-threatening which 
had made Pam collapse.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Luckily it was I who found 
her instead of a total stranger. No telling what could have happened 
then,” Linfa murmured to herself.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The &#39;Successor to the Aureole&#39; 

had been flying to the Chapel to oversee the revenue report and bring 
back the information to her boss, Aregna, the Chairman representative 
of the Angel Council and most powerful angel, when she caught sight 
of a devil girl with short red hair.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Linfa wouldn&#39;t admit it, but 
she hoped it was Pam for it had been awhile since she had seen the odd 
girl. So when she saw the staggering devil get slammed into a wall and 
fall hard, Linfa immediately forgot her mission and descended very quickly 
to come to the aid of the woman devil. It turned out to actually be 
Pam!</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And Pam must have seen her 
before she lost consciousness because she whispered Linfa&#39;s name. The 
angel&#39;s pale cheeks became quite pink but she shook it off as she laid 
a hand across Pam&#39;s forehead and found a high fever.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“She is sick, but I can&#39;t 
take her to the Chapel. They won&#39;t treat her…” </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Linfa looked around trying 
to figure out what to do when the young woman caught sight of the restaurant 
that was part of a cook-off challenge between angels and devils to gain 
more business in Urk so many years ago. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Maybe that manager&#39;s still 
there.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now the problem was deciding 
if she should leave Pam to go get the restaurant manager or to bring 
Pam with her. Pam chose this moment of enter feverish dreams and called 
out to Linfa again. That decided it.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Linfa got up from her kneeling 
position then crouched down to take the sitting Pam into her arms. Hooking 
one arm under the devil&#39;s knees and the other around her shoulders, 
Linfa hefted Pam up and began walking the rest of the way to Ziggurat. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam unconsciously cuddled up 
to the source of warmth she felt near her and twined her slender tail 
around it. Linfa almost dropped Pam when she felt the red headed devil&#39;s 
tail encircle her waist and two hands clench onto her shirt front. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Hmmm…warm…” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The light blush came back and 
grew slightly darker as she neared the busy restaurant. Spirits and 
devils all stared at the sight of the long blue haired angel cradling 
the shorter red haired devil in her arms.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">An elder devil with russet 
skin and white hair sporting a white chef&#39;s uniform took one look before 
hurrying over to the two. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Miss Linfa! What&#39;s wrong 
with Pam?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This is the manager of Ziggurat 
and Pam&#39;s employer for many years; just the devil Linfa was looking 
for.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I found her collapsed out 
on the street with a high fever. I brought her here so you could get 
her to a doctor in the Guild.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Certainly! Just give me 
one moment to arrange things here and I&#39;ll get her to a doctor nearby.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Manager went into the back 
to tell his assistant chef that he needs to leave for a short time but 
will be back in time for the supper crowd. Coming back out, the old 
devil found Linfa near the door with Pam still in her arms. The red 
devil stretched out his hands to take Pam.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I&#39;m sure you have important 
thing to do &#39;Successor of the Aureole&#39; so I&#39;ll take Pam to the doctors 
if you need to leave.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Linfa just turned her back 
to him and began walking out of the restaurant. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Just lead the way if you 
please. I have nothing of importance to do right now so I may as well 
see this to the finish.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The old chef lowered his arms 
and just smiled at Linfa&#39;s roundabout way of saying she wanted to make 
sure Pam was alright for herself. The light pink in the angel&#39;s cheeks 
merely confirmed to him that she was Pam&#39;s friend…maybe more…</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Then please follow me Miss 
Linfa. And thank you for helping her. She means a lot to me; one of 
the best employees I&#39;ve ever hired and a sweet girl.”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Linfa only nodded to acknowledge 
before following the red skinned devil to the nearest doctor&#39;s office. 
When the question of payment for services rendered popped up, Linfa 
immediately handed over the correct change and told the doctor to do 
his job. Grumbling a bit at the attitude of this uppity angel, the doctor 
went to work examining and prescribing medicine for Pam.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Linfa was brought out of her 
musing remembrances by the door opening and the restaurant manager coming 
in. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I called the school and 
got a hold of Pam&#39;s teacher, Lizyerra, and she said she would send over 
Pam&#39;s two roommates to pick her up and take her home.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Nodding, the angel took one 
more glance at eh resting red head before getting up and leaving. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Then I will leave her in 
your capable hands until they come. Good day.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And Linfa left to go continue 
her work now that she knew Pam was taken care of.</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">----</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam sat up abruptly, nearly 
knocking heads with Raim who was about to feel her friends&#39; forehead 
to see if the fever was going down. Raim leaped back with a yelp, falling 
off her chair and right into Vine. Both devils ended up on the floor 
with Raim&#39;s beet red face in Vine&#39;s full bosom and Vine&#39;s knee treading 
dangerous waters between Raim&#39;s legs. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Linfa!”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">That snapped the two fallen 
girls out of their embarrassed shock and had them scrambling into more 
dignified positions. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“W-what Pamuchi?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam didn&#39;t get a chance to 
reply because that nasty headache from before found her brain again 
and was doing its best to pound the gray matter into mashed potatoes. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“My <i>head</i>!” </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Vine quickly went to the desk 
nearby and grabbed two tablets from the medicine the doctor supplied 
and a glass of water to wash it down. Raim backed away and tried not 
to talk too loudly.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Pamuchi, do you remember 
what happened?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Shaking her head then wincing 
when it hurt too much, Pam gratefully accepted Vine&#39;s offers; swallowing 
the medicine and draining the glass of water.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Thanks Vine.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Vine smiled in return and took 
the empty glass back to the desk. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“What do you remember and 
why did you call out that snobby angel&#39;s name?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Lying back down, Pam closed 
her eyes for a moment and thought back to that dream she was having. 
“I do remember getting off the bus at the headquarters then walking 
through the Guild trying to find a doctor. But I got lost and found 
myself near Restaurant Ziggurat and the Chapel. Next thing I remember 
is being pushed into a wall and hitting my head, then white wings and 
violet eyes.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam ducked her head and blushed 
before continuing. “I think that&#39;s when my dreaming started because 
I remember Linfa carrying me into Ziggurat then into the doctor&#39;s office 
following Mr. Manager. I can hear voices through the door in the white 
room I&#39;m in, and then I feel warmth and a cool cloth being placed on 
my forehead by Linfa. She leaves after Mr. Manager tells her that you 
two were coming to pick me up…”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Looking at the two faces above 
her, Pam finished. “Then the next thing I know, I&#39;m right here.”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Raim sat back and Vine sighed 
in relief. “Well, it looks like your memory is fine.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam&#39;s eyes shot open. “You 
mean that was all real? Linfa helping me and carrying me to the doctors 
and…!”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Raim slapped a hand over Pam&#39;s 
mouth to prevent a headache from developing in her own head. “Yes 
Pamuchi, it was all real or at least what Mr. Manager could tell us 
was.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Unexpectedly Pam&#39;s eyes drooped 
and her face went slack. She was out like a light five seconds later. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Whoa! Vine, what did you 
give her?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Vine shook her head. “I only 
gave her the medicine from the prescription. It&#39;s supposed to make her 
sleep because that way her headache and fever won&#39;t wake her up all 
night. The doctor said that she&#39;ll get better with plenty of uninterrupted 
rest.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Raim shrugged as Vine covered 
Pam with an extra blanket so she wouldn&#39;t get cold then turned and walked 
to her room to get ready for bed. Stretching and yawning, Raim followed 
partway before splitting off to her own room right off the living room 
they all shared, whereas Vine continued further to her room behind the 
kitchen.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Raim paused for a moment with 
one hand on the doorknob before squaring her shoulders, taking a deep 
breath and turning to catch Vine just opening her bedroom door. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Vine!”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The pureblooded devil stopped 
and faced her friend. “Yes?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Looking into those deep brown 
eyes, the once spirit, now devil girl, almost lost her nerve. Luckily 
for both of them, Raim is too stubborn to back down from anything. Strong 
and usually rough hands gently encircled Vine&#39;s upper arms and pulled 
her closer so firm lips could bestow a surprise goodnight kiss.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&#39;Too soon&#39; was on both their 
minds in protest against the kiss ending. Yet Raim released Vine and 
stepped back to give the assuredly startled woman a chance for her mind 
to catch up to what just happened.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Well…Goodnight Vine!”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The lime haired devil just 
about ran off if not for the deceptively strong hand holding onto her 
arm and pulling her back in for another kiss; Vine having decided she&#39;s 
waited long enough for Raim to make a move and now it was her turn.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Both girls moaned at how good 
this felt and didn&#39;t want it to end. Breathing became a problem however 
and they both had to tear their mouths away to gulp down precious air 
before they could dive back in.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">During the time filling their 
lungs they noticed their positions. Vine was against her bedroom door 
a good four feet off the ground with her legs wrapped around Raim&#39;s 
waist and her hands were tangled in the slightly taller devil&#39;s spiky 
lime colored hair, undoing the usual pigtails.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Raim had her tail circled around 
Vine&#39;s slender waist to help hold her up and leave her hands free to 
travel from long black tresses to a pale arched neck and down over full 
pert breasts to squeeze silky thighs before starting all over again. 
A little red appeared on smiling faces but that didn&#39;t stop them from 
kissing and caressing more.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It wasn&#39;t until Vine banged 
the back of her head against her solid oak door arching so Raim could 
have better excess to her neck that Raim and Vine released each other. 
And stand there just breathing…heavily. Slowly Vine&#39;s right hand reached 
out and caught Raim&#39;s left while her own left turned the knob to enter 
the bedroom.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Raim paused on the threshold. 
“Are you sure?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A sweet yet sexy smile and 
impatient tug brought Raim stumbling into the room. “Yes. I&#39;m sure.”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As noises and rustling escalated 
the door was closed by an absentminded wave of the hand and locked with 
a few breathless words before even words were no longer distinguishable 
form the pants and moans that filled the night; except for two screamed 
names and hushed &#39;I love yous.&#39;</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">----</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It was a full week before Pam 
was fully over being sick and able to leave her room without at least 
one of her friends going too. As much as Pam appreciated the concern, 
she was very happy to learn that she was completely healed and given 
free reign once again.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The first thing on her agenda 
(besides get out of the building) was to find and thank Mr. Manager. 
Then she could devote the rest of the day to find and just be with Linfa.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If the angel will let her of 
course.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Since school was still out 
for another week or so Pam had plenty of freed up time so if Linfa proved 
difficult, Pam could just keep trying until she succeeded.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Throwing on tight denim shorts 
with a white tank top showing off her filled out black sports bra and 
tying up the laces of her sneakers, Pam was ready to leave. Going out 
the door, the red head called out to her two roommates.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Raim, Vine! I&#39;m leaving! 
You two behave appropriately while I&#39;m gone! I don&#39;t want stains on 
my couch like last time!!”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“PAMUCHI!!”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Raim&#39;s outraged yell was accompanied 
by non-stop giggles. Pam made good her escape from Raim&#39;s wrath.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">On her way to the bus stop, 
the former human woman decided she would rather enjoy the nice air. 
From out of nowhere popped two full leather wings. Spreading them and 
pumping hard once, Pam rose in the air and sailed through the sky, following 
the road leading to the Guild. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It still seems amazing to Pam 
that she could fly. Just a few years ago she couldn&#39;t even get off the 
ground let alone soar through the endless blue above her head. Pam was 
enjoying herself so much that she almost missed the restaurant on the 
border between the angel&#39;s Chapel and the devil&#39;s Guild.</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Stretching her wings up and 
further back, Pam gently touched down right in front of the building. 
Folding her wings and making them disappear to wherever they go when 
she&#39;s not using them; the cute devil girl joined the afternoon lunch 
crowd that was choosing between eating at Ziggurat or the angel&#39;s Café 
Ishtar. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Not feeling hungry enough yet 
to eat lunch and anxious to find Mr. Manager (ok, she just really wanted 
to eat lunch with Linfa) Pam hurried past the spirits, devils, and angels 
to reach Ziggurat just as the old red skinned devil chef came out to 
open it for the lunch hour.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Mr. Manager!”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The chef smiled at the young 
female waving and coming towards him. “Pam! You&#39;re on your feet again!”</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam giggled and gave her elder 
a quick hug. If his skin shade suddenly darkened slightly on his fact 
no one really took notice, least of all Pam.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I came by to thank you for 
helping take care of me when I was sick.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam backed up and bowed formally. 
“Thank you Mr. Manager.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He bowed back and reassured 
her that her thanks are appreciated but not necessary. “It should 
be the &#39;Successor of the Aureole&#39; that you should thank.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam nodded and blushed. “I 
planned on gong to find her after I had thanked you Mr. Manager.”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The restaurant chef just smiled. 
“Then you better not waste any more time talking to this old devil 
and go find your angel.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Manager laughed at Pam&#39;s 
bright red cheeks as he opened his business for lunch. “And if you 
two happen to get hungry there are two meals on the house waiting for 
you here.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Still blushing, Pam flew up 
again from the newly unlocked front door and waved her thanks and goodbye 
to her favorite employer, receiving a thumbs up in reply.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Jeez!”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Embarrassed but smiling, Pam 
hovered above the restaurant for a moment, trying to think of places 
Linfa might frequent where Pam could meet up with her.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Most of her time is probably 
spent in the angel&#39;s realm and I can&#39;t go there because of the treaty 
between devils and angels to not set foot in each other&#39;s lands. So 
by default that means she&#39;s not in the devil&#39;s realm either.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Slowly floating towards the 
Chapel just across the street, Pam thought she should ask one of the 
local angels or spirits if they&#39;ve seen Linfa today.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“The only place we can really 
meet and hang out is here in Urk, in the districts. And I know she reviews 
the books on the revenue and income by donations for the Chapel so she 
has to come here at some point.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam descended to the street, 
this time on the opposite side of the road, near Café Ishtar, run by 
the angels in direct competition with Restaurant Ziggurat. The crowd 
here was about the same size as that of the one at Ziggurat. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Good. That means there&#39;s 
been no trouble for awhile.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam was recalling the cook-off 
for territory which she participated in during her first year as a devil 
intern. A nearby spirit looked at Pam oddly as she came over.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Why is a devil over here? 
Usually they all go to Ziggurat or other places in the Guild to eat, 
not the Chapel.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam just smiled. “I&#39;m looking 
for Miss Linfa. Have you seen her around here today?”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The spirit was surprised at 
Pam&#39;s answer. “No, I haven&#39;t seen the &#39;Successor of the Aureole&#39; 
today.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam looked so crestfallen that 
the spirit quickly added a tid bit of information. “But she usually 
comes around this time on Friday to grab something to snack on while 
she gathers the week&#39;s data from the Chapel.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam&#39;s crestfallen look transformed 
into an overjoyed grin. “Today&#39;s Friday! Yes!”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam leaped into the air unfolding 
her wings with a snap before turning and shouting her thanks to the 
spirit below her. The red haired devil then proceeded to hover near 
the Chapel&#39;s cafe waiting to catch sight of Linfa since she usually 
arrives by flying in.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It wasn&#39;t long before Pam&#39;s 
pointed ears caught the sound of flapping wings. Her smile was soon 
replaced by a huge grin that showed off her two fangs, as the long haired 
angel came into view. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Linfa wasn&#39;t alone however, 
but that didn&#39;t stop Pam from calling out and flying towards the group 
of three angels.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Miss Linfa!”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam didn&#39;t even really notice 
the other two angels on either side of the older girl; she only saw 
Linfa. The usually serious angel intern had seen Pam hovering above 
the Chapel&#39;s café as she and her two companions had been approaching. 
Linfa wouldn&#39;t admit it but she had been entertaining the idea of asking 
the manager of Ziggurat about Pam&#39;s recovery.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now she didn&#39;t have to since 
it seems Pam found her first. Linfa was glad to see the devil intern 
had recovered from being sick but the angel cursed the timing because 
her boss, Aregna, was accompanying her to conduct his own report for 
the year so he could present it to the other council members and that 
meant she had to stay with him unless he released her from duty for 
the day. Highly unlikely.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The third angel was of no consequence 
since it was just Digitalis who ran Café Ishtar. He was also the one 
to go against and be beaten by Pam in the cook-off. Digitalis was flying 
with them to try and sell a new hare-brained idea of his to Aregna. 
He wasn&#39;t succeeding and Linfa had long since tuned him out.</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As Pam&#39;s approach and shouted 
greeting, Linfa smiled a very small smile for two seconds before her 
facial features smoothed back into their haughty mask. The smile was 
seen though, by both Pam, whose grin grew brighter, and Aregna who just 
noted it before finding his attention focused on Digitalis who still 
harbored a resentment of loosing to the girl when she was younger.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Well, if it isn&#39;t the little 
girl who thinks she&#39;s a chef. What are you doing here? That low-end 
eyesore of a restaurant is on the other side so you better run along 
little girl!”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Can we say bitter! Linfa threw 
a chilling glare at the mocking angel but before he could turn and catch 
it, Pam ignored him completely and latched onto Linfa, almost causing 
both of them to tumble out of the air.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Thank you so much for helping 
me Linfa!”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The words, whispered right 
into her ear on a warm breath, sent shivers down the angel&#39;s spine. 
Aware of the stares from the male angels, Linfa didn&#39;t return the embrace…or 
melt like she wanted to. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She couldn&#39;t stop the blush 
on her cheeks however and, again, Aregna noticed but didn&#39;t comment. 
Firmly, after about 6 seconds locked in the hug, Linfa pushed away from 
Pam&#39;s hold and held her at arms length.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Miss Pam…”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Before Linfa could think of 
anything to say, she was cut off by Digitalis who slashed at Pam with 
the energy sword given to all angels.  <br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Get away from her foul devil!”</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam was thanking the powers 
that be that the crazy angel had bad aim…and that she did not. Nevertheless, 
he did score first blood as evident by the trickle of blood trailing 
down her left cheek and dripping off her chin.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“How dare you attack the 
&#39;Successor of the Aureole&#39;! Begone you filthy creature!” Digitalis 
pointed his sword straight at Pam, ready to attack again should the 
devil move wrong. His bravery, of course, was a show he was trying to 
put on so he could boast how he had defeated a devil defending the angels&#39; 
beloved successor. Then he would be promoted to a more powerful position 
where he could call the shots and no longer be a lackey. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He had this scenario all worked 
out in his head and it was riding on his memory of Pam as a little first 
year intern, not the full-fledged devil woman floating in front of him. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">His mistake.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Being taught by devils gives 
a very unique outlook on being challenged, insulted, and made to bleed; 
one that is much different from the angels&#39; teachings. Devils don&#39;t 
back down from anything like fights, especially when they know they 
can win. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Raim is the reigning champion 
of brawls and knock-down-drag-out fight. Pam is Raim&#39;s only real challenge 
among all the interns and most full-fledged devils. But then, Digitalis 
doesn&#39;t know this…yet.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A pink tongue snaked out and 
grabbed at a few drops of blood dripping from the long wound. A smile 
soon followed, chilling the blood of the sword brandishing angel. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I won&#39;t kill him.”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This was the only thing Pam 
said before she struck! Whether it was directed at herself or the others 
was unknown, but Pam kept her word. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Her tail lashed out and crushed 
the wrist of the hand holding the weapon rendering it immobile and useless 
no mater how hard Digitalis struggled. Pam watched with amused and dark 
crimson glowing eyes. The hand that reached out to grab the male angel 
by his collar had seemed to sprout wicked looking nails and her horns 
seemed to take on extra fine points while gleaming ominously.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Linfa was seeing a side of 
Pam that she only caught a glimpse of once in a while whenever Pam battled 
to make sure none of her friends get hurt by others. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&#39;Wow…&#39; Wide violet eyes took 
in the scene of Digitalis frantically trying to hit Pam with his sword 
and fist but missing and taking all the blows Pam threw at him. It wasn&#39;t 
long before the &#39;battle&#39; was over and an unconscious Digitalis with 
many bruises and cuts was being held in the air only by his collar.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The victorious devil flew back 
over to the stunned Linfa and expressionless Aregna. Turning to the 
only awake male, Pam deposited Digitalis&#39; form into his hands. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Here, you can take him to 
the doctors or something and while you do that, you can give Linfa the 
rest of the day off so she can spend it with me.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Linfa was horrified at the 
way Pam addressed her boss but at the same time trying to hold back 
the laughter at the incredulous look on Aregna&#39;s face. The quiet male 
angel finally spoke.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You do know who I am?”</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam nodded and looked him square 
in the eye. “I do know who you are Mr. Aregna.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The most powerful angel seemed 
to smile without doing so, then turned to Linfa. “I find myself having 
a few unexpected tasks to take care of and your assistance is not required 
so you are free to do as you wish until the following morning when I 
expect you back for class.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">With that, Aregna flew towards 
the Chapel; Digitalis hanging limp by his collar in Aregna&#39;s left hand. 
Linfa bowed her head.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Thank you.”</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As soon as Aregna had landed 
in front of the Chapel and went inside surrounded by various angels 
and spirits who worked there, Linfa brought her gaze back forward towards 
Pam to see crimson eyes riveted on her.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This flustered Linfa but she 
didn&#39;t show it and just raised an eyebrow. “Well?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam smiled. She had been waiting 
to see what Linfa would choose to do. Her question was an agreement 
to spend the rest of the day with Pam. Once again flying closer, Pam 
took Linfa&#39;s hand and pulled her through the sky towards Restaurant 
Ziggurat.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I&#39;m feeling hungry and I&#39;m 
pretty sure you are too since it is just past the lunch hour. And besides, 
Mr. Manager said that there are two house specials with our names on 
them waiting for us.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Why not eat at Café Ishtar?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Because Mr. Manager invited 
us.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Linfa let it drop. The old 
devil had obviously helped take care of Pam so really, she didn&#39;t care 
where they went to eat. Devil and Angel touched down softly on the street 
in front of their chosen eatery, drawing all eyes to them.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It was <i>very</i> unusual 
to see a devil and angel willingly spend time together. Nevermind that 
one was the &#39;Successor of the Aureole&#39; and the other was a fairly high 
ranked devil in her own right. Pam on the other hand is considered an 
odd one and so when the locals recognize her, they take the oddness 
in stride and go about their way.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“After we eat here, we can 
go to the sweets shop just a little further in and grab some candy while 
we walk around the Guild and Chapel districts.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam slowed down her excited 
plans to shyly look at Linfa. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“That is, if it&#39;s alright 
with you Linfa?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Frankly, Linfa didn&#39;t have 
any problem with letting Pam plot out their course; she just felt fine 
being around the energetic girl. The angel wanted to share something 
with Pam in thanks for the day out (she wouldn&#39;t call it a date…even 
if it sounded like one!)</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“There is one place I would 
like to go at sunset…”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam nodded vigorously. “We 
can do that!”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Holding the door open, Pam 
motioned her companion to enter first. They seated themselves in a corner 
booth away from all the stares and so they could both see the entire 
room. Before they could even pick up their menus, Mr. Manager came over 
with two house specials and glasses of water.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">They ate and talked, getting 
more and more comfortable in each other&#39;s presence. Two hours later 
they exited the building after thanking Mr. Manager for the wonderful 
meal, and headed down the road towards the sweets shop.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Heads whipped around to follow 
the sight of the angel and devil traveling together without animosity 
and eyes nearly popped out at the happy and relaxed expressions on both 
girls&#39; faces.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Not to mention quite a few 
looks were driven by lustful thoughts. There was no denying that both 
girls were hot. They were both in their late teens and filled out their 
outfits very well. Each girl had exotic looks but was opposite each 
other in coloring and that made watching them move together like watching 
a most beautiful painting come to life. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The devil girl had a big happy 
smile on her face constantly and was talking away to her partner. The 
angel had on a smile too; a little less wide but still as brilliant 
as her friend&#39;s. And that&#39;s how they were the whole time on their adventure 
in Urk.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Leaving the sweets shop with 
plenty of goodies between them they headed to a devil outfitting store 
and Pam modeled a few looks for Linfa, getting comments and compliments 
back for her idea. Pam eventually convinced Linfa to try on an outfit 
and nearly fell out of her chair at how sexy the skirt and small halter 
shirt was on the blushing angel. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Linfa got a lot of compliments 
on her temporary look from Pam and while she went to change back into 
her white uniform and blue skirt, Pam went to the old woman sales clerk 
and told her to package that outfit up after they left and send it to 
her dorm. Pam paid for it with the idea of giving it personally to Linfa 
the next time they met then went to meet the dressed Linfa and they 
walked out of the store. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">They continued to wander Urk 
until sunset, alternating between the two districts. Initiating contact 
for the first time ever with Pam, Linfa grabbed the devil girl&#39;s hand 
and spread her wings.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Come on Pam, it&#39;s almost 
sunset.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Stunned but relishing the contact 
she didn&#39;t start, Pam snapped out her wings and both girls flew above 
Urk until Linfa set down in a secluded area of the Chapel district. 
They were surrounded by flowering hedges that encircled a tall, old 
tree with branches reaching past the hedges, hiding the small clearing 
with a spring fed pond from most passerby. Bright red apples gleamed 
from between dark green foliage and the setting sun cast patterns of 
red, orange, and gold through the branches to hit the water and bounce 
back.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Linfa let go of Pam&#39;s hand 
and sat down at the base of the tree. “I found this place by accident 
when I was flying one day and ever since then I come here to relax and 
think once in a while. I do not believe anyone else but me, and now 
you, knows about it.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Touched that the angel had 
shared something very precious to her with Pam, the devil girl sat down 
beside Linfa after putting her wings away and gave her a hug. “Thank 
you Linfa.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The older girl allowed herself 
to fall into the embrace and even return it slightly, awakening those 
feelings that have been brewing in her chest all day. And they sat like 
that for some time, just watching the sun settle down for the night 
and the stars come out to play with the bright full moon.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Fireflies were dancing everywhere 
in the surrounding area, creating a very romantic atmosphere that was 
definitely affecting both girls.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam got up from the embrace 
with Linfa and jumped into the tree. Linfa frowned in confusion at Pam&#39;s 
actions and was pleasantly surprised when Pam came back down and crouched 
in front of her presenting a fully blossomed flower and an apple so 
delicious looking that Linfa almost didn&#39;t have the heart to take the 
offering.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But she did and bit into it 
as Pam wove the flower into the long dark strands of hair that crowned 
her head.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“An apple for you so you&#39;ll 
have something for supper.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Linfa lifted an eyebrow. “And 
the flower?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pam blushed. “Because I thought 
it would look beautiful on you…and it does.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Linfa&#39;s cheeks turned pink 
as well and she held out the apple from which Pam took a bite. The trail 
of juice from the apple was stopped by rose colored lips on tan skin. 
Pam stopped moving, stopped breathing. Even her tail froze.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When Linfa pulled back and 
licked her lips free of the juice she had just kissed off of Pam&#39;s cheek, 
the devil&#39;s tail came to life again and wrapped around her angel&#39;s waist 
under the white shirt, pulling Linfa closer.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Feeling the prehensile tail 
squeeze and rub against her bare skin shot electricity up and down Linfa&#39;s 
entire body and brought forth a small moan at the warmth pooling in 
her belly.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Gentle hands took the apple 
from long, lithe fingers and set it down before cupping porcelain cheeks 
and brushing pink lips against rose ones. Linfa&#39;s freed hands reached 
up and tangled in short red hair, pulling for a deeper kiss which Pam 
gladly gave. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The kissing continued for some 
time in between breathing breaks and roaming hands freeing each other 
from their cloth restraints until all they felt was skin on skin.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Linfa&#39;s hands trailed from 
Pam&#39;s toned abdomen up to her small breasts, lingering for a bit and 
bringing forth deep throated growls before continuing over pointed ears 
and through short damp hair until they reached the base of Pam&#39;s horns.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Then they held on for dear 
life as Pam&#39;s lips blazed a fiery trail down a pure white neck to full 
breasts and hard nipples. At the same time a teasing tail brushed along 
sensitive spots around Linfa&#39;s waist and lower eliciting breathless 
gasps and drawn out whimpers of pleasure. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Hotter and hotter things got 
until they reached their climax with their partner&#39;s name coming forth 
from gasping lips.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">After a quick dip in the cool 
water of the spring, they rested in the soft green grass against the 
giant apple tree and finished the forgotten apple. Pam lay on her side 
and pulled Linfa to curve into her embrace with the sneaky tail still 
wrapped around the angel&#39;s waist. It was still bright enough out to 
see the outlines of things and as Pam cradled Linfa close she kissed 
her cheek.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I love you Linfa.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Slender arms rested on the 
ones encircling her and the angel turned her head so her gaze would 
connect with Pam&#39;s.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I love you too Pam.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The hug tightened a bit as 
Pam smiled and brought out one leathery yet soft wing to cover her beloved 
angel and keep her warm. And that&#39;s how they slept until Linfa had to 
leave at dawn to get ready for her lessons for the day.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The angel kissed the devil 
goodbye and they exchanged loving words and touches before they went 
their separate ways; promising to meet up again when the angel had free 
time.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">That entire day, both girls 
had ecstatic smiles on their faces and more than one person speculated 
as to why. Raim and Vine definitely noticed Pam&#39;s absence during the 
night and Aregna noticed the rumpled state of Linfa&#39;s clothing but it 
wasn&#39;t until much later that the devil and angel would tell anyone about 
their relationship. Pam having found contentment in being a devil, and 
the removal of the Law of the Conservation of Luck, asked Linfa to move 
in with her in an old house on the edges of Urk; living happily together 
for the rest of their lives and bringing a peace between Devils and 
Angels.</font> <br> <br> <br> <br></p>
