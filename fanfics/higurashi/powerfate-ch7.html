<h1>The Power of Fate (part 7 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../higurashi/index.html">Higurashi no Naku Koro ni</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mouse0910.html">MousE0910</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../higurashi/powerfate-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><p><u><b>Disaster Awakening</b></u></p><p>"Where am 
I? What is this? Why am I strapped to this table? What is happening?" He didn't remember 
anything. After a while, his memories returned.</p><p>"I see. Irie has put me here. I am 
sick. He has to find a cure for me. It would be dangerous both for me and other people if I 
went out. That's what he told me." Satoshi thought about his strange disease when something 
crossed his mind.</p><p>"Shion!" He tried to raise his head to see if she's here but he 
couldn't move. He was bound too tightly. Satoshi remembered very well how Shion read him 
stories, whispered in his ear, lied her head on his chest. She was so beautiful. It pained 
him to see her but not be able to tell her anything. Satoshi wished he could get out of 
here. He hated the sight of the ceiling. He hated the smell of the room. He hated 
everything in this room besides Shion. Suddenly, Satoshi heard some voices.</p><p>"Yes, 
yes. Thank you for coming, Kasai. I really appreciate it."</p><p>"That's okay Dr. Irie. I'm 
always happy to help."</p><p>"I'm glad I can have you by my side. I really feel safe with 
you."</p><p>"Don't worry. I'm ready to subdue him at any time."</p><p>"Subdue? What are 
they talking about?" Satoshi grew panicked.</p><p>The door opened. Satoshi saw Irie and 
Kasai come in.</p><p>"Hello Satoshi!" Irie greeted him happily. "I have good news. I 
managed to make a cure! Soon, you will be able to return to everyone! We'll untie you now, 
so please, don't panic."</p><p>Irie's words calmed Satoshi down a little.</p><p>"Don't do 
any sudden movements. Your muscles are still very sore from not moving for a long time. The 
only reason you're able to stand now are the muscle stimulants we administered you. Here, 
drink it all."</p><p>Satoshi carefully took the glass from Dr. Irie. His fingers trembled a 
lot and he had difficulties holding it. He forced himself to raise it to his mouth and 
drink a little.</p><p>"Good, good. That's right. Drink more." Irie smiled at 
him.</p><p>Satoshi drank the remaining water and handed the glass back to 
Irie.</p><p>"T-Thank you." Talking seemed unfamiliar to him.</p><p>"You're welcome. Now, 
why don't you come with us, so I can give you the cure.</p><p>Satoshi tried to stand but he 
fell back.</p><p>"Watch out! Kasai, please help Satoshi. It looks like he still has some 
trouble standing."</p><p>"I understand." Kasai quickly ran to Satoshi and helped him stand 
up.</p><p>"Can you walk?"</p><p>"I-I think so..." Satoshi tried taking a few steps. After a 
while, he felt much more sure to walk.</p><p>"L-Let's go."</p><p>"That's okay. We can wait 
for a while before administering the cure. There's no need to rush. Take it 
easy."</p><p>"NO!" Satoshi's hand started scratching at his neck. "Satoko needs me. I have 
to help her. She needs me!"</p><p>"Okay, okay. We'll go now, if that's what you 
want."</p><p>Satoshi calmed down a little but still remained vigilant. He followed Irie to 
a room full of strange equipment.</p><p>"Please, sit here. These tubes will monitor your 
status." Irie pointer to a seat in front of him.</p><p>"O-Okay." Satoshi slowly made his 
way to the seat. Kasai strapped his wrists and legs to it.</p><p>"What are you doing?" 
Satoshi started to panic again.</p><p>"Don't worry. This is just for safety. If everything 
goes well, you'll be out from there in no time."</p><p>"T-Then hurry up."</p><p>Irie nodded 
and checked Satoshi's condition. Syndrome level: 5 suppressed to 5%.</p><p>"That's good. 
Everything looks okay. We can begin. Just relax, Satoshi. It will sting a little but then, 
hopefully, you'll be cured."</p><p>Satoshi nodded and Irie began the process. Kasai stood 
near Satoshi, in case something went wrong. A needle riser behind Satoshi and slowly moved 
to him until it touched his neck.</p><p>"Don't worry. Close your eyes. It will all be over 
soon." Irie continued to reassure Satoshi.</p><p>The needle slowly pierced Satoshi's neck. 
Satoshi screamed in pain.</p><p>Calm down! It's okay. It's okay." Irie checked Satoshi's 
condition again.</p><p>Syndrome level: 5 suppressed to 10%... 15%... 20%... 25%... 40%... 
55%...</p><p>"Kasai, get ready! We're reaching critical levels!"</p><p>Kasai nodded and 
pulled a gun from his holster. Satoshi screamed and twisted in pain. Irie looked at the 
monitor again.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"Satoshi!" Irie screamed when the syndrome gauge 
suddenly moved.</p><p>Syndrome level: 5 suppressed to 70%... 30%... Level 4... Level 3... 
Level 2... Level 1... Syndrome isn't present.</p><p>Irie looked at the monitor 
unbelievably.</p><p>"It worked! It really worked. I have managed to cure the Hinamizawa 
Syndrome! Kasai, please untie Satoshi."</p><p>Kasai looked relieved. He was glad everything 
went without any problems. He started untying Satoshi when something caught Irie's eye. The 
gauge on the monitor moved again.</p><p>Syndrome level: 1 suppressed to 0%. 
Non-activated.</p><p>"That's strange..."</p><p>Suddenly the gauge moved like 
crazy</p><p>Syndrome level: 2... 3... 4... 5 non-suppressed... 6... 7...</p><p>The syndrome 
level raised at an overwhelming rate.</p><p>"Kasai! We have problems," Irie looked on 
Kasai. "I don't believe this..."</p><p>Satoshi now stood completely out of the chair, 
holding Kasai's gun aiming at Kasai's head.</p><p>"Wait, Satoshi! Think about what you're 
doing!" Irie screamed desperately.</p><p>Satoshi looked at him with eyes full of paranoid 
fear. He pulled the trigger with his trembling fingers. Irie saw Kasai's headless body hit 
the ground. He screamed.</p><p>"W-What are you doing? We want to help you!"</p><p>"Shut up! 
Take me to 'Tokyo' immediately!" Satoshi aimed the fun at Irie.</p><p>"W-Why would you want 
to travel out of here?"</p><p>"Don't play stupid! I know everything. Shion told me. You're 
part of an evil organization called 'Tokyo'! Take me to them."</p><p>"The group known as 
'Tokyo' is not a threat anymore. Keiichi and others managed to beat them."</p><p>"Liar! Why 
would Shion cry, then?"</p><p>"Because she loves you. She wants to be with you but she 
can't."</p><p>"N-No! I would never make Shion cry!" Satoshi started scratching at his neck 
viciously.</p><p>"Please, don't do that! You'll kill yourself!"</p><p>"SHUT UP!" Satoshi 
screamed inhumanly. He aimed the gun at Irie and shot several times. Without looking back, 
Satoshi ran out of the clinic.</p><p>"What am I going to do now? I have to find others. 
What did he say again? 'Keiichi and others...' I don't know any boy named Keiichi. He has 
to be a spy from 'Tokyo'. I have to get to school." Satoshi changed his course and made his 
way to school.</p><p>"Okay, everyone. Let's start with the afternoon class." Chie-sensei 
singed happily. She was in a really good mood today. Everybody looked happy as well. It 
warmed her heart to know those kids are safe. She was just in the middle of her sentence 
when somebody slammed the door open. He held a gun. Chie looked unbelievably at the unknown 
guy. He came in and aimed the gun at her.</p><p>"Take me to 'Tokyo'!"</p><p>Chie knew what 
she had to do from her 'Safety Manual for Teachers': "I'm sorry, I don't have any car. You 
can take the train if you want to. No need to aim the gun."</p><p>"Don't toy with me. You 
know what 'Tokyo' is."</p><p>"I really don't know what are you talking about."</p><p>"Wait! 
I know what you mean!"</p><p>Satoshi looked over his shoulder in the direction of the 
voice. He saw a brown-haired boy.</p><p>"No! Keiichi, leave it to me!" Chie screamed 
desperately.</p><p>"Keiichi?" Satoshi scratched at his neck. He screamed inhumanly. "It's 
him!" Satoshi thought as he tried to come up with a plan to get to 'Tokyo'.</p><p>"Please, 
calm down." Chie tried to comfort him.</p><p>"No! If you won't take me to 'Tokyo', I'll 
make you do so. Satoshi had Chie get out of the class, lock it and retrieve some ropes with 
him from the school storage. He ordered her to tie everyone up, firmly. He said that if he 
finds just one loose rope, he'll kill everyone. Chie didn't resist and did as he said. 
After he finished, Satoshi tied her up too and checked the others. She really tied them. He 
was satisfied. Now he has hostages. Sooner or later, 'Tokyo' will have to appear.</p><p>"I 
need a backup plan." Satoshi thought. He went back to the school storage and retrieved a 
fuel canister from it. He went to the class and spilled it everywhere he 
could.</p><p>"Lighter. I need a lighter." Satoshi searched the lockers.</p><p>He got to a 
locked labeled 'Rika Furude'. He opened it and saw a lighter. When he picked it up, he 
noticed there is something written on it.</p><p>'To Rika from Hanyuu'</p><p>"This will have 
to do." Then Satoshi remembered he left his bat in his locker. He opened it and was 
relieved to find it still there. It felt good to have a weapon that feels comfortable. 
Suddenly, the door burst open and a little blonde-haired girl rushed through.</p>
