<a href="../higurashi/powerfate-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><P><U><B>Unexpected Complications</B></U></P><P>It was long night for Hanyuu and Satoko. 
Rika has been "trying" her new powers the whole night. Hanyuu didn't know how many times 
she has been healed by Rika only to get beaten to a bloody pulp again. She didn't believe 
that one can feel so much pain.</P><P>The night seemed like eternity for her. Finally, sun 
came up.</P><P>"Well, I guess that's all for today. We'll continue tomorrow, so be 
prepared." Rika laughed cruelly. Although she has been merely playing with then, she 
actually learned something new. She discovered that she can twist and deform objects with 
her telekinesis if she concentrates enough. When she realized that she tested it on 
Hanyuu's arm. She could hear the bone splinter and saw Hanyuu holding her arm in awkward 
position, screaming in pain. Rika was satisfied with the result and didn't torture Hanyuu 
anymore for that night.</P><P>"Hanyuu, make breakfast." Rika ordered while healing Satoko 
from her last test.</P><P>"Yes, mistress Rika." Hanyuu moved to the 
kitchen.</P><P>"Please... No more... End it... Kill me..." Satoko wailed at Rika's 
legs.</P><P>"No, I won't kill you. I need some good slaves." Rika laughed as Satoko 
cried.</P><P>"This isn't Rika. She can't be. Rika wouldn't do this to me." Satoko rolled 
these thoughts in her head over and over to overcome the pain and sorrow.</P><P>After 
eating her breakfast, Rika ordered Satoko to clean up and had Hanyuu find every possible 
exit in the house.</P><P>"Don't forget, Hanyuu. I can read your thoughts."</P><P>"Yes, I 
won't forget, Mistress Rika"</P><P>While both girls worked, Rika got a bottle of sake from 
her secret stash and began drinking. It felt so good to be evil. Memories of what happened 
rise on her mind. Se remembered Takano trying to shoot them. She remembered how Mion stood 
before them, shielding them, ready to take the bullet. She remembered how Hanyuu took the 
danger onto herself. She remembered the miracle that happened. The bullet missed Hanyuu, 
impossible at such short range. Yet, Takano missed. Rika laughed. Stupid Takano. She was 
too weak. She should have shot immediately. She shouldn't have hesitated. Well, what 
happened, happened. Rika knew that she wasn't going to make the same mistake as Takano. 
Rika knew she couldn't afford to hesitate. It would be the end of her. Anybody could 
discover what was going on at any time. She has to be careful in her next steps. First, she 
had to make sure nobody would ever find anybody in here. The Furude Estate and the Shrine 
would be her only safe spots. She made sure by destroying or blocking every exit in the 
house except for the main door.</P><P>"I have searched the whole house. There isn't any way 
out or in not counting the main entrance." Rika could tell that Hanyuu wasn't 
lying.</P><P>"Good. I think it's time for me to move. Let's pay our dear friend Rena a 
visit." Rika grinned. Come, both of you!" Rika ordered the girls.</P><P>"Yes, mistress." 
Satoko and Hanyuu both replied.</P><P>Rika grinned. Satoko now too understood her position. 
She knew that there was no other way than to obey Rika. Rika could lift things with the 
power of her will and maybe even read thoughts. Satoko didn't see a way out of this 
nightmare. She could only obey Rika in every way and hope that a miracle happens.</P><P>As 
the three girls made their way to Rena's house, Rika thought about her next steps. First, 
Rena. After that, Keiichi. With all of them made into slaves, Mion & Shion would not be 
able to do anything. Rika could always threaten to kill one of them, most probably Keiichi, 
since Mion has some feelings for him. Yes, it's a perfect plan.</P><P>Suddenly, Hanyuu 
tackled Rika and brought her to ground. She started punching Rika in the face.</P><P>"Run 
Satoko, run! Tell Keiichi and the others. We can still save Rika!"</P><P>Satoko knew 
immediately that this is the miracle she has been waiting for. Without hesitation, she ran 
in the direction of the village. Her only hope was to get far away from Rika. Satoko run as 
fast as she could with her heart racing. She looked behind herself. She didn't saw anybody. 
That was a good sign. She only hoped that Hanyuu is alright. Rika will sure be furious and 
maybe will even kill her. Satoko made her legs move even faster. Faster, faster, faster. 
She couldn't afford to slow down. Once she would be caught by Rika, all hope would be lost. 
She couldn't let Hanyuu's risky attack be in vain. Finally, Satoko saw the village. She run 
straight to the school but something didn't seem right...</P><P>Rika was shocked by the 
sudden attack. She didn't believe that Hanyuu could do something like that after she 
resigned on her resistance. Hanyuu had to get the idea mere seconds before tackling her, 
otherwise Rika would have known about it. She wrestled with Hanyuu on the ground, unable to 
concentrate enough to use her powers.</P><P>"Take this! And this! And this!" Hanyuu punched 
at Rika furiously, converting all her pain and sorrow into anger. When Hanyuu managed to 
get a clean hit into Rika's face, Rika started to feel dizzy. She managed to stay conscious 
only by her sheer will.</P><P>Hanyuu didn't expect to be able to actually attack Rika. But 
a miracle happened and Rika didn't notice that Hanyuu plotted against her. It was thanks to 
this miracle that Hanyuu could grant Satoko a chance to escape and get help. It hurt her to 
beat Rika but it was for Rika's own sake. Hanyuu almost stopped when she saw that Rika has 
problems staying conscious. But she couldn't stop her attacks. Her only chance lied in 
making Rika unable to concentrate enough to use her telekinesis. Suddenly something 
happened. Something that made Hanyuu froze in her movements. Rika began crying. She didn't 
try to fight back. She just cuddled and cried. Hanyuu stopped beating Rika and became 
concerned for her friend. She was afraid that maybe she has gone too far.</P><P>"Rika, are 
you alright?" Hanyuu asked and kneeled next to her friend. "I'm sorry I hurt you. I had to. 
Everything will be alright now, you'll see."</P><P>"Yes... Everything will be alright 
now... Now that you have given me such a chance!" Rika grabbed Hanyuu's head and brought 
her knee into it, breaking Hanyuu's nose. Hanyuu squealed in pain. Rika didn't waste any 
time and lifted Hanyuu into the air. She began turning and twisting Hanyuu's legs and arms 
until she heard a crack. Hanyuu shrieked inhumanly. However, Rika wasn't done. She hasn't 
even begun. She will make her suffer dearly for her treason. But that had to wait. Right 
now, Rika's main problem was Satoko. She had to find her. Rika slammed Hanyuu into the 
ground head first, knocking her out. She lifted Hanyuu's body with her telekinesis and let 
it follow her. Then she ran to the village as fast as she could.</P><P>Satoko ran into the 
class, barely catching her breath.</P><P>"Listen to me everyone, Rika..." Satoko then 
noticed that everyone is tied up and gagged. Too late she had realized there is an enemy. 
The last thing she remembered was how somebody slammed her with a bat.</P><P>When Satoko 
woke up again, she was tied and gagged, just like the rest. She could finally look at the 
criminal. But what she saw made her eyes watery. No way... That just wasn't 
possible...</P><P>Rika stopped before entering the school to catch her breath. She looked 
at Hanyuu, who was still unconscious. She had to hide her somewhere close. Rika found an 
empty class and threw Hanyuu's body in there. She then used her telekinesis to lock the 
door and deform the lock, so the only one who could open the door again would be her. 
Satisfied, she made ripped the door off and entered the class. What she saw there made her 
freeze in shock. It was shocking enough to find everyone tied up but what was even more 
shocking was seeing the person who did this... Rika couldn't believe it. That was just 
impossible.</P>
