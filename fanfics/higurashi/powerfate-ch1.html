<h1>The Power of Fate (part 1 of 13)</h1>

fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mouse0910.html">MousE0910</a><br> </h2>
<p><u><b>Hanyuu's Confession</b></u></p><p>"Fate. How long have I been struggling against it? How 
many worlds have I come through? That, I truly do not know. Nonetheless, that's irrelevant 
now. With everyone's help, I have finally managed to beat Fate and now, a bright future 
awaits us."</p><p>Rika opened her eyes and was looking right into Hanyuu's face. Rika 
smiled in a special way, in a way she reserved only for Hanyuu. Then she realized that 
Satoko wasn't laying on her futon. She got up and looked around. Rika felt relieved when 
she heard Satoko whistling from the kitchen. Hanyuu slowly opened her eyes and moaned 
sleepily. She went with Rika to the calendar on the wall and tore down a page. They felt 
relieved when they saw the date. July 1st. They finally did it. They really are free. Rika 
and Hanyuu looked at each other and smiled when Satoko's voice brought them back to 
reality.</p><p>"Are you two up already? Why don't you clean up the futons of you have time 
to sit there or we won't be able to eat."</p><p>"Hai!" Rika and Hanyuu replied 
simultaneously.</p><p>"Hanyuu, we really did it!" Rika happily stated while she cleaned her 
futon.</p><p>"Yes, we did. It's almost unbelievable. We broke the infinite loop." Hanyuu 
smiled at Rika.</p><p>"Can you hurry up a little, I'm almost done!" Satoko signed from the 
kitchen. She was trying to make it look like she was scolding them but it was evident she 
was really happy.</p><p>As they were cleaning the room, Rika shrouded herself into her 
thoughts again.</p><p>When they arrived to school, everyone has been waiting for them 
eagerly.</p><p>"Hey, Rika. How are you?" Keiichi smiled at her kindly.</p><p>"I couldn't 
feel better! Thank you, everyone. You all helped me create a miracle and defeat Fate. 
Nipaa~. I'm so happy! For everyone!" Rika hugged Keiichi and cried tears of joy.</p><p>"I 
told you it is possible to change your fate if you try, didn't I?" Keiichi patted Rika's 
head gently.</p><p>"Yes, you did. You really did." Rika dried her tears and smiled at 
everyone. "Keiichi, Rena, Mion, Shion, Satoko, I have to thank you all, for everything you 
did. You are the best friends I could ever have."</p><p>"I'm glad we made it. Right, 
Onee-chan?" Shion patted Satoko on her head.</p><p>"It's too bad that Satoshi's still 
missing." Mion changed the subject.</p><p>"Where did Satoshi go...? I wonder, I wonder." 
Rena asked the question everyone feared to ask.</p><p>"I hope Nii-Nii is okay." Satoko 
whispered silently and everyone didn't speak anymore in memory of their lost 
friend.</p><p>However, unbeknown to them, one person in their group knew about Satoshi. 
Knew about his condition and whereabouts. Knew why Satoshi disappeared. She knew 
everything.</p><p>Everyday, Shion visited the Irie Clinic to see Satoshi and talk to him. 
She didn't know if he can hear her but she didn't care. Even if he wasn't aware of 
anything, she would always come. Sometimes, she read him books. Sometimes, she just sat 
there for long hours, watching him. That sight was delightful and sad at the same time. 
Shion couldn't be happier to know Satoshi is alive but it pained her heart to see him in 
his condition. One day, Irie will surely discover a way to revert the disease and then, 
Satoshi will return. He will pat her on her head as he used to. He will smile at her in his 
special way that made her blush. He will return. He has to. Hopefully, one day...</p><p>On 
a rainy day, Hanyuu approached Rika after school: "Rika, there is something I have to tell 
you. In private. We'll meet in the Furude shrine. It's very important."</p><p>"Okay, 
Hanyuu, I'll be there. Hey! Wait for me!" Rika hastily ran to her friends.</p><p>"Oh, Rika! 
You're pretty slow, you know? How about we raced each other one day?" Satoko poked Rika 
with her typical laugh.</p><p>"Mii~. I don't mind but don't cry when you lose. 
Nipaa~."</p><p>"He he he. That's a great idea for a club activity. I really like it." Mion 
said with a grin.</p><p>"But wouldn't that be unfair to Satoko, Rika and Hanyuu? Kana? 
Kana?" Rena looked interested in the idea of them having a race.</p><p>"You're right that 
could be a problem."</p><p>Then, Keiichi came up with an idea: "How about we create two 
different groups. One for us, the elder ones, and one for them, the younger ones. Not that 
it makes any difference for Satoko. She will come last anyway."</p><p>"What was that? I'll 
outrun everybody! And if I don't, I'll make sure they won't outrun me. I'm not called Trap 
Master just for laughs." Once again, Satoko's laugh could be heard.</p><p>"Hey! That's 
dirty, using traps in a race!"</p><p>"My, my, Keiichi, are you afraid of losing to a little 
girl?"</p><p>"Of course not, I'll beat you anytime!"</p><p>"We'll see!"</p><p>"Then it's 
settled. This weekend, on the school courtyard at 2:00 PM sharp. The race is on! That's my 
last word as a club leader."</p><p>"All right!" Everyone answered happily.</p><p>Rika was 
looking forward to the race but she wondered why Hanyuu seemed so down. Rika dismissed the 
thought for now. There will be enough time for that later. Nothing can go wrong now. They 
managed to avert The Great Hinamizawa Disaster and there is just no way for it to happen 
now.</p><p>That night, Rika snuck out of their home, leaving Satoko asleep and went to the 
Furude Shrine. Hanyuu was already waiting there.</p><p>"What do you want to talk 
about?"</p><p>"Well, that is... Um... Au... Au..."</p><p>"Hanyuu, it's all right. Whatever 
it is, I'll help you and we can work everything out. Just tell me."</p><p>"Rika..." Tears 
started pouring from Hanyuu's eyes. "Au au au... A great tragedy is bound to happen if I 
don't stop it."</p><p>"A tragedy? What tragedy? How can we stop it?" Rika immediately 
became alert. She fought for this perfect world so viciously... She will defend it using 
all possible means.</p><p>"You can't stop it. Only I can..."</p><p>"Then, how can I help 
you? Tell me! I'll help you divert this tragedy at all cost!"</p><p>"Rika... This 
tragedy... It can be averted only by sacrificing my own life and happiness..."</p><p>"No, 
no... What are you saying Hanyuu?" Rika's eyes became watery. "There has to be a different 
way!"</p><p>"Believe me Rika, if there was any other way, I would gladly take 
it."</p><p>Rika knew that if there really was any other way, Hanyuu would know about it. 
She leaned on Hanyuu's shoulder in deep despair and began crying openly.</p><p>"Hanyuu, oh 
Hanyuu. Why? Why did such a thing have to happen?"</p><p>"I'm sorry Rika. It has been fun 
but now, we must part ways."</p><p>Hanyuu held Rika's head to her shoulder as they both 
cried in their anguish.</p>
