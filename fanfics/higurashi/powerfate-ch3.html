<h1>The Power of Fate (part 3 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../higurashi/index.html">Higurashi no Naku Koro ni</a>

<a href="../higurashi/powerfate-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><P><U><B>Rika's Return</B></U></P><P>After that night, Rika started going to school again. 
Everyone looked surprised when she just showed up, without explaining anything. Everyone 
began to ask her questions but Rika dismissed them all with a smile. Just as they were 
about to begin a new wave of questions, Chie-sensei came in and started the 
class.</P><P>Satoko sat beside Rika, as usual, and whispered to her silently.</P><P>"Rika, 
why don't you speak with us? You keep on smiling but don't explain anything. Why didn't you 
come to school in the first place? It looked like you were in a deep sorrow."</P><P>Rika 
looked at Satoko and giggled a little.</P><P>"What are you talking about, Satoko? I just 
wasn't feeling too well, that's all. Nipaa~"</P><P>"Oh, really?" Satoko knew Rika for long 
enough to recognize that she is lying. "Are you sure it's not because you know about 
Hanyuu's fate?"</P><P>"How... How do you know something like that?"</P><P>"Hanyuu told us. 
We gave her no choice. Don't worry, Rika. We share your pain."</P><P>Surprisingly enough, 
Rika didn't look sad. Satoko wondered why. Suddenly, Rika burst into a huge 
laugh.</P><P>"Pain? I feel no pain. I feel only joy, for I know a way to save 
Hanyuu."</P><P>"Really? That's great news. We have to tell them!"</P><P>The principal rang 
the bell and everyone started packing their things and leaving the class. Satoko began to 
rise when she was stopped by Rika's hand. She looked at Rika and saw a serious expression 
in her face.</P><P>"Don't." Rika said coldly in her mature voice.</P><P>"B-But why? Why 
can't I tell them? I have to tell at least Hanyuu."</P><P>"No. Especially not Hanyuu. She 
must not know about this. Never. Otherwise, there won't be a way for me to save her 
anymore. For this to work, Hanyuu must know nothing about this. Do you 
understand?"</P><P>"Yes. I won't tell anybody about this."</P><P>Days passed and Rika 
almost started to hope that Hanyuu was wrong. That no artifact will ever exist and Hanyuu 
was just letting her imagination run wild. However, deep inside, Rika knew that it was 
real. She was sure of it.</P><P>One late night, when Rika just sat on the window and drank 
her favorite Sake, Hanyuu came to her.</P><P>"Rika... It's time for me. The artifact has 
appeared." Hanyuu couldn't hold her tears back anymore and held to Rika 
desperately.</P><P>"I'm so sorry Rika, for not being able to stay here with you. For all 
the pain I caused you. I hope you will live happily."</P><P>Rika hugged Hanyuu more closely 
and whispered in her ear.</P><P>"Don't worry, Hanyuu. It's not your fault. You don't have 
to apologize."</P><P>"T-Thank you." Hanyuu sobbed and smiled at Rika for one last 
time.</P><P>"Take care of yourself. Sayonara, Rika."</P><P>"Sayonara..." Rika also cried, 
unable to withstand the sudden burden of reality without Hanyuu.</P><P>Just when Hanyuu was 
about to go, she stopped in her tracks and looked back at Rika.</P><P>"Rika... Please, 
don't try to follow me. It will be better for you that way."</P><P>"I understand... I won't 
follow you."</P><P>"Thank you." Hanyuu smiled sadly at Rika one last time and went on her 
grim journey.</P><P>When Hanyuu left, Rika quickly forced herself to stop crying. She could 
not afford to cry now. Not if she wanted to save Hanyuu. Rika dried her tears and quietly 
sneaked out. It wasn't all that hard to find Hanyuu. Rika managed to catch up with her 
before the first crossroad. Hanyuu walked slowly, looking to the ground. Suddenly, Hanyuu 
stopped and looked behind her. Rika only barely managed to hide herself behind a tree. She 
heard Hanyuu mumble to herself.</P><P>"Hmm? Just my imagination? I'm getting paranoid. Calm 
down, Hanyuu. There's no one that would follow you."</P><P>Hanyuu began to walk again and 
Rika moved with her. She carefully sneaked from tree to tree and hoped that Hanyuu won't 
look back at a wrong time.</P><P>Suddenly, Hanyuu stopped again.</P><P>"Why is she 
stopping? Did she see me? This may be bad." Rika squeezed herself behind a tree and peeked 
a little. She saw Hanyuu glow a little. The glow got gradually stronger and stronger to the 
point it was almost unbearable to look at it. Hanyuu lifted from the ground and said 
something in a language Rika didn't understand. It seemed like it's from another world. For 
all Rika knew, it may very well be so. Hanyuu dropped back to the ground and the glow 
weakened a little but it didn't disappear. Hanyuu continued on her route. She now moved 
with greater certainty. It looked almost like she was following something. Rika didn't have 
time to think about it as she had to run in order to catch up with Hanyuu again. It was now 
much harder for Rika to stay unseen, because Hanyuu moved much faster than before. Finally, 
they came to a trash dump. Rika couldn't understand why would Hanyuu go to this place. 
Before she realized it, Hanyuu was already in the center of the dump. A black ball of 
energy levitated before her and Rika immediately knew that this is the artifact Hanyuu was 
talking about. There was no time to spare. She has to act now. Her legs began moving in 
Hanyuu's direction. Rika only hoped she would make it in time.</P><P>Hanyuu slowly made her 
way toward the artifact, thinking about her life with Rika. Suddenly, she heard something. 
Hanyuu immediately jerked herself to stop and looked behind herself. She didn't see 
anyone.</P><P>"Hmm? Just my imagination? I'm getting paranoid. Calm down, Hanyuu. There's 
no one that would follow you."</P><P>Hanyuu went back on her way. After a while, she felt a 
thump in her chest. It's close. Hanyuu focused and tapped into her remaining godly powers. 
She searched for the artifact. Hanyuu felt it and made an abstract line to the artifact she 
could follow. Hanyuu now knew where the artifact is. It was logical. It's the most remote 
place in Hinamizawa. Hanyuu made her way to the trash dump. She located the artifact and 
used her powers to raise it in the air. She could feel the vile aura. Hanyuu took a deep 
breath.</P><P>"So, this is it. This is the end."</P><P>She prepared to absorb the artifact 
when she heard a desperate scream.</P><P>"NO!"</P><P>Hanyuu looked in the direction of the 
scream and blinked in surprise.</P><P>"Rika?"</P><P>Her concentration broke and the 
artifact started to fall to the ground.</P><P>"What are you doing here?" Hanyuu shouted at 
Rika.</P><P>Without wasting her breath on answer, Rika jumped for the black ball and caught 
it in the air.</P><P>"I made it!" Rika thought as she plummeted to the ground.</P><P>Hanyuu 
saw Rika fall and rip open her leg badly on a scrap of metal.</P><P>"Rika! Are you alright? 
What were you thinking? Give me the artifact. You need to go to the hospital."</P><P>Rika 
slowly dragged herself from the ground and smiled at Hanyuu in her own special 
way.</P><P>"Don't worry Hanyuu, I won't let you perish. I will save you."</P><P>Rika 
slammed the ball into herself, absorbing it.</P>
