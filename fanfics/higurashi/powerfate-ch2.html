<h1>The Power of Fate (part 2 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../higurashi/index.html">Higurashi no Naku Koro ni</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mouse0910.html">MousE0910</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../higurashi/powerfate-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><p><u><b>Revelation of a Secret<br></b></u></p><p>Later that day, Hanyuu explained everything to 
Rika in detail. Because Rika defied Fate, a paradox has occurred. Fate is something that is 
decided and shouldn't be changed. However, Rika managed to create a miracle and defied 
Fate. Because of that, a mysterious artifact appeared in this world. This artifact contains 
all sins, madness and evil from both the worlds that already passed and the worlds that 
were yet to come about, should Rika die again. Everything concentrated in this one single 
artifact. It held immerse power. It would be complete disaster if somebody were to find it. 
Although Rika understood how dangerous it was, she couldn't imagine, how it relates to 
Hanyuu.</p><p>"Rika... You know about my life, before I became like this, don't 
you?"</p><p>"Yes. If I remember correctly, you were a shrine maiden, miko, just like I am, 
right?"</p><p>"That's right. However, people of that time were sinful. In order to redeem 
their sins and give them a chance to live, I have been sacrificed."</p><p>"And you became 
known as Oyashiro-sama..." Rika grasped the situation.</p><p>"I am the bearer of sins. It 
is my sacred duty to redeem people of their sins. I have to find and destroy that artifact. 
I am the only one, who can do it. It is my duty."</p><p>"Then... That means..."</p><p>"Yes. 
I have to absorb the artifact into myself. However, it is too powerful to bear, even for 
me. That's why my life is going to end and with it, the artifact will be destroyed. After 
that, you can finally live freely."</p><p>"What are you saying? How can I ever live freely 
without you? I don't want anyone to die!" Then, a thought crossed Rika's mind. "But you 
will return to the 'place between worlds', won't you, Hanyuu? Then, maybe, you could find a 
way to return to this world."</p><p>"I'm sorry Rika, that is not possible. I won't return 
back. I will cease to exist at all. No other worlds, no other chances, nothing. It will be 
the definite end for me."</p><p>"No! No! No. No..." Rika started to weep silently. "This 
can't be real. It has to be some sort of nightmare. This cannot be real. Cannot be. Cannot 
be..."</p><p>Hanyuu couldn't find any words to soothe Rika's sadness. Everything she could 
do was to apologize: "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."</p><p>After 
that, Rika fell into a state of constant sadness. She didn't talk, she didn't move, she 
only cried. Hanyuu had to come several times a day and force her to eat and drink. Rika 
didn't allow anyone else to come close to her. Whenever Satoko approached her, Rika ran 
into the forest and stayed there, until Hanyuu found her and persuaded her to return. 
Hanyuu felt really sad for Rika but she knew that, eventually, Rika will be back to normal. 
However, her friends had different opinions.</p><p>"Hey, Satoko, what's with Rika? She 
hasn't come to school in several days, we're becoming really worried. Did something 
happen?"</p><p>"I don't know. She hasn't spoken a word since she stopped coming to school. 
Whenever I get close to her, she runs away. The only person that is able to speak with her 
is Hanyuu."</p><p>"Hmm. Let's ask her." Mion took lead, as usual.</p><p>"Okay. But where is 
she? Her seat is empty..." Keiichi asked suspiciously.</p><p>"That's strange... She has 
been here a while ago."</p><p>"Hauu~" Everyone turned to the source of the sound. 
"Omochikaeri!" It was Rena, holding Hanyuu closely and spinning around with 
her.</p><p>"Hey, Rena, what are you doing? We have to ask Hanyuu an important thing. She 
may know something about Rika's strange behavior." Keiichi looked angry.</p><p>"I know. I 
have already tried asking her but she doesn't want to tell us anything."</p><p>"Oh. So 
that's how it is. Sorry for being mad at you, Rena."</p><p>"That's okay. I 
understand."</p><p>Mion took the lead again: "Hanyuu, you know something about Rika, don't 
you? Please, tell us."</p><p>"Au au au... I... I... can't..."</p><p>"Nonsense!" Keiichi 
interrupted her. "You can tell us everything. Together, we will come up with something. It 
is important to talk to your friends! That's what we all learned, right?"</p><p>"That's 
right!" Everyone replied simultaneously.</p><p>"Hanyuu, please. Rika is my dearest friend. 
I have to know what happened to her. Please, tell me." Satoko's eyes became 
watery.</p><p>Everyone looked at Hanyuu in expectation.</p><p>"Au au au... Don't look at me 
like that..."</p><p>"Then tell us! What happened to Rika?"</p><p>Hanyuu looked around 
herself. She looked into the faces of her friends and when she saw that they are all 
determined to find out the truth, she sighed.</p><p>"I guess it can't be helped... Very 
well, I'll tell you but promise me one thing in return."</p><p>"Of course. What is 
it?"</p><p>"Look after Rika for me, will you?"</p><p>"S-Sure but why do you ask such a 
thing?"</p><p>Hanyuu slowly raised her head and looked into their eyes.</p><p>"I'll tell 
you then. Listen closely as it pains my heart to talk about it."</p><p>Back at the Furude 
Shrine, a blue haired girl finally stopped crying. She slowly rose from the floor and dried 
her tears. Rika came out and looked at the sky. That's it. That's it! She now finally knows 
a way to save Hanyuu! It is really simple. Why didn't she think of that in the beginning? 
Rika shouted into the night.</p><p>"I know! I know it now! There is a way! Don't worry, 
Hanyuu, I'll save you! I'll save you!"</p>
