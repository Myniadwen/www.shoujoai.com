<h1>The Seeds of Evil: Dragon Rising (part 12 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../soulcal/seedsevildr-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Case Subject:

One Talim, age 15. No last name; born June 15, 1578 in an undisclosed
location within the Philippine islands of Southeast Aisa. Under
heavy influence from the Spanish Empire, the Philippine islands were
losing their original heritage as they were forced to conform to the
will of those with methods of greater force.

However, there were some that decided to keep their ways and
traditions intact... There were a tribe of people who prayed to and
believed in the Wind Goddess. Knowing that the turmoil and upheval
would eventually bring chaos to their own people, they decided to
maintain their balance with nature and the winds for as long as they
could.

Also knowing perfectly well that Talim was to be their last priestess,
the village elder, Kalana, raised her to fulfill such a role. And as
she trained, all around her noticed that her affinity with the winds
was unmatched by any before her. She understood the ebb and flow;
the currents, patterns, and whispers; and soon, she began to hear
voices. Distant conversations from other cities and countries reached
her ears, though faint and almost unreadable.

She was tested and tried in every way, shape, and form, including
methods of defending herself. Using the people&#39;s ceremonial wind dance,
she was capable of utilizing the winds to not only evade incoming
attacks and enhance her own fists, feet, and blades with powerful
air-slicing abilities, but could also read the path and speed of
an attack during the heat of battle, and could thus react accordingly.

During her training excersizes, as her skill improved... no attack
touched her. It looked as if she were simply performing another ritual
dance rather than trying to defend herself from harm.

However, the day would come when her life would be changed forever...

During the year 1589, at age 11, she was reading the winds as she
usually did. Now highly skilled at reading the messages on the air 
currents, she could hear the spoken words as gentle whispers in her
ear, her senses extending further and further as time passed.
Perhaps it was because of her ability to tap into the spiritual
plane via these same winds that it happened.

Overwhelmed by a surge of energy and sheer malevolence from multiple
areas -the nearest one being China, currently in its Ming Dynasty and
undergoing the desecration and destruction of the Ling-Sheng Su
monastery- she was assaulted by an outcry of despair... death...
suffering... unparalleled by anything she had witnessed before.

It was widespread and final, as if the souls of the world, living
and passed on, mourned in unison.

She passed out without knowing why the desecration was happenning.

For three days, she was unconscious... and during all three days,
she was thrown into the void between life and death. It was there
that she heard the voice... not knowing who or what spoke such
words or why it spoke them. She was constantly shown images
of what was happenning around the world- as if she were being
given a front-row seat to the end of days.

The people were beginning to lose all hope that their link to the
Goddess had been severed when Talim finally awoke, tears streaming
from her eyes without any knowledge of why she shed them.

Somewhere deep within her very soul, she was crying for the world
outside. No one, not even Talim herself, knew that she had reached 
a potential far greater than anyone had expected... but at such a high 
cost for everyone else.

It would be four more years before she felt the same thing again. By
this time, her village had been found and negotiations were being made
for trade and resources. The going had been peaceful so far, with
no disturbances- no battles or fights. The compromise of the village
had come quietly and swiftly, as the shamans and elders knew it would.

During this time, a man brought a strange red fragment of metal into
the village, touting it as a vitality charm. Holding the piece of
metal in her hand, she conferred with the elders on her decision to
leave the village. The fact that the shard carried the same evil as
the day she had passed out four years ago was unmistakable.

She was going to resolve this once and for all.

The determination of the Last Priestess of the Wind Goddess shone
fiercely from her eyes as the elders unanimously voted against the
decision. If she were exposed to the outside world, her purity 
would be tainted. However, her parents, for the first time in
quite some time, disagreed.

By experiencing the world and its various cultures, races, and
ways of life, her love for nature would grow- as would her purity.
Having nothing to say in their defense, the elders permitted her to
leave with the shard in hand.

Her senses were so finely attuned with the wind that she could sense
where the other fragments were, though it was a vague thing still.
But the fact that they came from the exact same pieces of metal as
the one in her hand was undeniable.

She had to set things right before it was too late.

However, an unexpected twist in events took place a few months into 
her journey... After coming into the company of a woman known as
Seong Mi-na, she would realize that there were few things more
important than an unbroken will and sheer determination. Though
her words were harsh and abrasive at times, Talim could sense that
deep within, she was a pure soul, untainted by the evils of the world.

Her traveling companion, known as Xianghua, had the same kindred spirit
as Mi-na&#39;s, save for the fact that it was more reserved- much calmer
and deeper. It wasn&#39;t to say that she didn&#39;t cherish them both equally-
she could simply see these things for what they were.

After seeing these things, and following the two of them around for
some time, the Sybil realized that her thoughts were increasingly
lingering upon them... much more so than anyone else. It was worry, 
and warmth, and a sort of light-headedness all at the same time.

She was falling in love with them, without even knowing what love was,
besides the general definition of benevolence and compassion. All she
knew was that she wanted nothing more than to stay by their side until
the journey was complete... and perhaps even further onward than that.

Her faith in the winds however did not wane... as long as they traveled
with her and she could hear its whisper at her ear, nothing was 
impossible. Not even being together with Mi-na and Xianghua forever...

Chapter 12- Shadow War (Part 5)
________________________________________________________________________

Talim walked through the forests surrounding the shrine, her eyes closed
and her arms outstretched, as if to gather the winds that had been left
untainted and pure to her. She was making an attempt to recall the
feeling that she had when her body reportedly lifted from the ground.
If she could do it again, and repeat it...

There was no reason that her logical, rational mind could see to do
this... but logic took a backseat to an almost childish curiousity.
If she could float... perhaps she could fly. It sounded silly, even
to her now awakened sense of adventure, but she had to give it a try.
Spreading her aura through the winds, she attempted to ask them
exactly what she should do- which direction she should take
in order to find what she sought.

Of course, there came a point where she was no longer alone, and the
wind itself spoke to her as something moved through the air. She
lowered her arms slowly, calmly. The Sybil did not open her eyes just
yet- her senses were already extended, and anything that passed through
her aura while it was spread through the air, she could pick up.

Due to the fact that she was training in these special skills since
she was able to walk and speak, she could spread her aura for quite a
distance. And as she did so, the person moving through the area,
leaping from tree to tree almost soundlessly as he or she landed on the
branch with the balls of their feet, was as plain to her as the feel
of the sun on her face.

But she said nothing; did nothing. It could simply be someone passing 
through. However, the air was disturbed again as the sound of something
being thrown through the air was picked up by her preternatural sense of
hearing. The winds spoke to her of an oncoming attack from her
front-right side, and she quickly spun to her left just before the
throwing stars hit, pivoting on her left foot and using the winds to
generate the force needed for her to move quickly.

Taking all this into account, her body was a nondescript blur as she
evaded the shuriken, letting them pass mere inches away from her body.
A voice came echoing throughout the trees as she opened her eyes. The
noise from the projectiles had successfully hidden the individual&#39;s
retreat, who had now been confirmed as a woman by her voice.

&quot;Amazing. You&#39;re as fast as they say. And I&#39;m betting you heard that
attack coming from a mile away, without even seeing it. Well done!&quot;

Talim turned around and looked upwards. A woman who seemed in her early
thirties and dressed in a white body suit with the glint of pale blue
armor on the arms, legs, and chest. Her light brown hair weaved and 
flowed gracefully, unbound and free to move with the wind. A gentle smile
and a graceful bow later, she introduced herself.

&quot;Sorry about the attack, but they say that there are two ways to get
to know someone- dining with them and fighting against them. I happened
to choose the latter.&quot; Talim nodded, understanding perfectly. &quot;You&#39;ve
come to see what I can do, then?&quot; The woman nodded. &quot;Don&#39;t ask for my
name- I don&#39;t have one. I&#39;m just a fleeting shadow among shadows, nothing
more.&quot;

Talim wondered why she said such a thing, and tried to read her emotions
through the winds, but they picked up nothing... an emptiness of sorts.
She radiated an aura of calm and peace that was more like a defensive
wall than anything else. It was a potent one too- Talim could not guess
at her intentions. So she gave a smile of her own and bowed in response.

&quot;I&#39;m willing to learn, then.&quot; The woman seemed satisfied at this and
just about vanished from sight, the only cue being the slight sound of 
the air being disturbed. As she landed on the forest&#39;s earthen floor, 
Talim&#39;s eyes widened in surprise and she reached for her weapons. 
But she was a bit too late; the woman was moving again, her body almost
blurring into nothingness.

This time, the priestess did draw her ceremonial elbow blades, fear
coursing through her veins. (She&#39;s too fast- I can&#39;t read her 
movements!) A tap on her right shoulder made her squeak in surprise 
before she could do anything else. &quot;What&#39;s the matter... can&#39;t you keep 
up with me? What happened to that speed from earlier?&quot; Talim turned and 
cleared her head with a few shakes from side to side before her skin 
flushed in embarrasment.

The kunoichi was right- Talim was supposed to be faster than this. All
that training and preparation for reading the movements of the wind, and 
here was a woman was faster than the wind itself. She took a few deep
breaths until she was able to look the female warrior in the eye again,
then sank to her knees and bowed her head as if in servitude.

&quot;Teach me, please! How can I be faster than the wind?&quot; The woman 
chuckled. &quot;You have the proper attitude for this training, that&#39;s for 
sure. You admit then that you know nothing about moving quickly or 
quietly?&quot; Talim nodded, but said nothing. The woman seemed satisfied 
at this.

&quot;Very well, then. Rise and let&#39;s begin. I want you to refrain from using
those wind abilities of yours until you can get it down pat, understand?
I won&#39;t tolerate cheating.&quot; Talim looked crestfallen. Her entire life
was based around the winds- to abandon them, even for this short while...

But the female ninja was unyielding. &quot;Do you understand?&quot;

Talim hung her head and nodded. This was going to be harder than she
thought it would be, but it was all worth it to help Taki and Mi-na.
&quot;I... understand.&quot;
________________________________________________________________________

The third day...

Taki did not have much to do, besides wait for the team that was sent
out to discern the whereabouts of Hachibei and Chie. The boredom was
driving her insane, and quite possibly was not healthy for her, who
enjoyed being as active as possible. She did not have much to do
besides speak with the members of the Fu-Ma which she called family
now.

It was a surprise what could happen in the course of three days.

In any event, she saw Kilik sitting against one of the walls, his
legs folded in lotus position and his breathing almost unnoticable,
due to the fact that it was so slow that he was barely seen moving.
The only sound that came from him were those of inhalation and
exhalation.

Taki wondered what exactly was on his mind, but knew that she could
not possibly read his thoughts. No one could without violating some
sort of sacred barrier. So she sat down in the same cross-legged
position next to him and began her own breathing in an attempt to
empty her mind and spirit.

For a while, neither moved... then, Kilik opened his eyes, sighing
to himself. He sounded troubled, as he always did. As he turned his
head, he saw Taki there, sitting next to him. Not surprised by the
stealthy manner in which she approached, he simply nodded and greeted
her.

&quot;It&#39;s a nice day for meditataion, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Taki opened her eyes
and nodded, looking towards Kilik with her usual indifference. &quot;Yes,
it is. I was wondering if you had anything you would like to learn
before our time here is over. Perhaps there is something you could-&quot;
Kilik shook his head and smiled diplomaticly. &quot;Thank you for the
offer, but I belive I&#39;ll pass. I wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable sneaking
around all the time. Besides...&quot;

His eyes took on a wistful, sad look. &quot;...I don&#39;t think she&#39;d
approve of it if I trained in these arts.&quot; Taki quirked an eyebrow.
(She? So even a monk has someone that he cares for.) There was
a slight note of teasing in her voice as she asked, &quot;Someone
important to you?&quot;

Kilik nodded. &quot;She was like a sister to me... four years ago,
during the spread of the &quot;Evil Seed&quot;, as they call it, she was...
killed.&quot; Taki&#39;s mild playfulness ceased at once as she listened to
his tale... but he would not speak of anything else on the subject.

He had already told far too many people of how Xianglian died by
his own hand- he did not need anyone else knowing of his shame.
But Taki applied the same determination she used to slay demons
in order to get him to speak. &quot;I see... forgive me if it sounded
like I was trying to pry,&quot; which she still was. He just couldn&#39;t
know it yet. &quot;Might I ask her name?&quot;

Kilik sighed to himself- a name was good enough, for the moment.
At least he could say that without feeling too guilty. &quot;Her name
was Xianglian.&quot; Something within Taki&#39;s mind clicked... it sounded
almost like... but then again, a few names were similar in China-
it could be any Xianglian at all. Still...

&quot;You know,&quot; she said after a while, &quot;That sounds remarkably like
Xianghua.&quot; Kilik&#39;s eyes widened in surprise. (What the... she
knows!? Or does she just have that sharp of a mind that one name
could figure out everything?) Of course, she hadn&#39;t figured out
everything- only the connection between the two names. The look
on Kilik&#39;s face had confirmed what she had thought.

&quot;So then, she has a sister that she doesn&#39;t even know about and
has never met. Considering as such, that would make you a
brother of sorts, would it not?&quot; Kilik&#39;s confusion cleared and
his face became neutral again as he nodded. &quot;Yes, that&#39;s right.
It&#39;s why I&#39;m coming along with them- to make sure she&#39;s safe.&quot;

He mentioned nothing about his own insecurities- those would
not be mentioned again, no matter what. Taki did nothing but
nod in acceptance of this reason. His reasons were not hers
to judge or criticize. Instead of continuing on her line of
questioning, she began her own recollections. He had given her
someone that he cared for after all, and she felt that she could
trust him.

&quot;I have... a friend that I&#39;ve known since we were both children.
Her name is Chie, and just like you, she was a sworn sister to me.
I swear, we were inseparable back then, when things were much 
simpler and much easier.&quot; Kilik was silent as she continued
speaking. &quot;She and Hachibei are my treasures. If I lose them...&quot;
Taki shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do.&quot;

Kilik considered for a moment, then nodded to himself. She 
seemed to be in the same position that he was so long ago- people
that were not family, but might as well have been, were in danger.
She had to protect them at all costs, even her own life. Still...

&quot;I won&#39;t train in these arts, however beneficial they might be.
But I will do this for you: I&#39;ll protect the two of them with my
life, as if they were my own family. I won&#39;t let another person
suffer because of... these evils around us.&quot;

He almost said &#39;because of me&#39;, but caught himself just in time.
Taki caught the slip, but missed the words, and thus did nothing
but nod and smile. &quot;Thank you. This means a lot to me, and I know
you&#39;ll do well.&quot; Kilik nodded, but he wasn&#39;t so sure himself...
________________________________________________________________________

Three days had passed.

Three whole days of damn-near torture. Talim had been pushed to the
brink, training with such intensity that her nerves were frayed and
her body was worn to the point of failure. But she had faced it all
without fear, her tenacity and resolve never fading for a moment.
On this last day... her teacher would have mercy.

&quot;You&#39;ve done well,&quot; she said to Talim while she was on her knees and
had her brown eyes focused on the ninja. Her ankles and calves were
notably stronger and more resilient, though their deceptive grace and
beauty had not been stolen in the process.

&quot;I must say- I&#39;m impressed at your unwillingness to break under the
strain. I have put you under the most stressful and rigorous training
that I could imagine for three days- and you have not once flinched. 
May I ask how you are able to do this?&quot; 

Talim did not hesitate to respond. &quot;Because I know that you are 
trying to help. It would have taken much longer if we had not done 
this with such intensity and pace. Besides, everything in this world 
is connected by the winds- and I believe this will be connected to
something further down my path, just like everything else that led 
to this point.&quot; The kunoichi rubbed her chin thoughtfully. &quot;So it 
was your beliefs that got you through all this, was it?&quot; Talim nodded, 
and did not respond.

After a few moments of silence, the female warrior smiled. &quot;Your
clarity of mind and purity of spirit haven&#39;t left you, even after
what I&#39;ve put you through. I&#39;d say that deserves something special.
So today, on the last day of your training, I&#39;m releasing the 
restriction on your abilities. However...&quot;

She reached into the folds of one of the pouches that hung from her 
belt and withdrew a black sliken sash. &quot;I will take something else
away from you in the process. Your sight. If you can still fight while
your vision is no more, I will allow you to leave in peace. Do
not think for a second that this will be simple... because I will
move at my full speed, without restraint. Do you understand?&quot;

Talim felt the fear and anxiety rise within her again. She would
be moving at the pace where she could not properly react to her
movements at all- much faster than the last time the two had 
encountered each other. On top of that, she would not have any
sort of visual cues what so ever.

Her body trembled slightly as her legs began to shake while she
still sat on them. But she had to learn how to conceal her
emotions while at the same time letting them flow freely. Her body
would not calm down, but her mind was set. It knew what it wanted,
and would not stop until it was achieved.

Without calming herself for any reason, due to the realization that
the sudden shaking and trembling was only her body&#39;s response to the
danger, she responded with &quot;Yes. I understand everything. Let&#39;s just 
hurry, before I change my mind... please?&quot;

The woman in white stood and walked over to Talim with the blindfold
in line with her eyes. With her eyes still open, the silken sash
was secured, tied behind her head... and everything was darkness. Her
fear rose to the surface again as a rush of wind signaled the rapid 
movement of her trainer, who had decided to get a move on as soon as 
the blindfold was secure.

Rising to her feet slowly so she wouldn&#39;t fall flat on her backside,
she did the only thing she could before going into a panic: expanded
her aura through the winds and embraced them as if they were some
sort of security blanket. Almost immediately, her breathing calmed
and her heart rate slowed. She sighed in relief as she heard the
whispers of the wind- they were still with her, even after her
neglect and mistreatment.

The only thought she had was (Thank you,) and she allowed her mind
to fully be wrapped in the embrace of the air around her. All at once,
she could feel, hear, smell... touch everything around her without
reaching her hands out or brushing against anything. She smiled in
contentment, spreading her arms in exultation.

And as she surrendered herself to the winds, she felt it. Movement.
It was barely discernible- hard to tell apart from the flowing winds-
but she could tell where the woman who had taught her how to move with 
a speed beyond that of the wind was. Drawing strength from the same 
currents that she had humbled herself to, she drew her weapons and
waited.

A vague part of her mind took note that the fear she had felt...
was gone. Her body was remembering what it had to do- what it had
memorized over the past three days combined with what it had 
memorized for the past ten years. Perhaps the anxiety was still 
there, but her mind had transformed it into strength and energy.

She was alert, yet relaxed- ready to change direciton in an 
instant. And an instant was just about all she had as she heard
soemthing approaching at high speed; an unimaginable, inhuman pace
that was far beyond her own.

At least, it used to be.

Her first reflex was to evade- she leaned her body backwards as 
the attack came, a single kodachi lashing out where her head used
to be. And yet, the next attack came quickly as the woman in white
turned on her right heel to send a side kick towards Talim&#39;s chest,
the left heel poised to slam into her as she came up.

The thing was- Talim had been trained far *too* well. She came back
up faster than anticipated, and heard the kick coming before impact.
She pivoted on her right foot, turning swiftly yet gracefully to her
opponent&#39;s left side as the kick shot past, retreating just as
quickly.

Her weapons were up in a guard positon now as she prepared for the
onslaught of attacks that she knew was coming. And as expected,
a flurry of attacks began, the blade and the limbs moving at such a
speed that it seemed impossible to block or defend against them all.
And yet within the heat of battle, Talim could hear where the next
strike was coming from, how many of them were coming, and whether
an attack was done with the proper intent or not... meaning that
she could not be faked or feinted.

The battle raged onward, neither landing a solid hit on the other.
Clothes were still intact- limbs were far from scratched, faces were
kept clear of blood, although there was plenty of sweat. They were
effectively deadlocked for most of the day...

But as the sun set and the day waned, Talim could begin to hear signs
of something big approaching. An attack that had a sense of finality
to it was being prepared with every strike, as if the woman who had 
once been unperturbed and supremely calm were getting tired of being 
so reserved. The young priestess agreed- it was time to stop playing 
around.

As a heavy, intricate diagonal cut was pulled off, aiming to cleave 
Talim from her right shoulder to ler left hip, the opportunity arose.
Talim aimed for her opponent&#39;s shoulder joint, her right arm quickly
snapping outwards as her grip tightened on the handle, executing
a vicious punch with the back end of the bladed tonfa.

The attack was stopped cold as the joint registered a sharp pain...
Before Talim hopped upwards and extended her legs in a double front
kick, the balls of her feet slamming forcefully into the chest of
her opponent. A sudden, gale force wind shot out from the kick,
exploding through and into the target and propelling Talim further
upwards and backwards...

Ten feet... fifteen... twenty... beneath the blindfold, Talim&#39;s
eyes widened as she felt the pull of gravity start to lessen. It were
almost as if she were flying... then, she felt the tree behind her, and
was snapped out of her trance as she twisted her body to the left.
To her surprise, the wind moved with her, as if sensing her peril. She
had turned a good three-sixty before fully realizing what had happened.

(I... I did it?)

Talim let the wind guide her to the ground before righting herself,
throwing her legs over her head and tucking in order to land on the
balls of her feet. Her breathing was heavy as she considered what she
had just done. Indeed, she had manuvered herself in mid-air without
a single thought or moment of hesitation- or had the winds taken
control of her at the last moment?

Either way... (I did it!) She had to say it out loud, just to make
it real.

&quot;I did it! I flew! Did you see?&quot; She ran towards her master, shouting
exuberantly as she completely forgot to ask if her sparring partner
were all right, as was her usual custom. The woman was indeed all
right- she had been winded and knocked quite a distance backward,
but other than that she was fine. With a smile on her face, she
nodded.

&quot;I *did* see it. You see now why I was training you so hard, don&#39;t
you? Let me ask you something... do you remember how you felt during
all that? What you said or did?&quot; She slowed her breathing and
considered... then nodded slowly. Thinking that she had the gist of
it, she began to explain. &quot;I felt... safe. Comfortable and relaxed,
as if I were floating. I didn&#39;t think at all- at least I don&#39;t
believe I was thinking. I simply... moved. And the wind moved
with me; through me. I don&#39;t know how to rightly explain it, but-&quot;

The teacher cut her off there. &quot;It&#39;s all right- I saw how happy
you were when you were allowed to use your full range of abilities
again. I can understand now how this works- you give yourself 
entirely to the wind and humble yourself to it. Only humility- 
deferrence to a higher power- can unlock your potential.&quot;

Talim&#39;s eyes widened for a moment... then she nodded, finally
understanding. &quot;Of course. I see it now!&quot; The woman nodded. &quot;Yes...
but do be careful not to use it for cruel intentions or to use such
power wantonly. It may cost you more than just the loss of control
over your body.&quot; Talim went silent, her bright mood shattered by
the reality of the situation.

This was serious stuff that she was beginning to tap into- it was
no game for a child. She had to treat this power, like any other
thing in nature, with respect. Nodding solemnly, she bowed gratefully
and gracefully to the woman in white. &quot;Thank you for everything, 
teacher.&quot;

The kunoichi smiled. &quot;Come now- don&#39;t be so saddened. I happen to
think that your smile is the most beautiful I&#39;ve ever seen. Don&#39;t
worry about misusing the power you&#39;ve tapped into; I can sense
your resolve and pure mind. Simply retain your integrity and act as 
you normally would, and it will come to you without hesitation.&quot;

Talim nodded again, the smile returning as she lunged forward for
a firm hug, the smile turning into a grin. &quot;Seriously- thank you
for everything. I&#39;ll never forget this!&quot;

The woman&#39;s eyes widened in surprise at the speed of Talim&#39;s
advance, then chuckled warmly as the words hit home. &quot;Neither will
I, Priestess of the Wind.&quot;

To Be Continued...
________________________________________________________________________

THERE... SMOKE ON THIS FOR A WHILE.

Hoo, boy. This one&#39;s a real winner, isn&#39;t it? At least, I think so.
This is where things get really interesting. I decided to play around
with the concept of Talim&#39;s control of the wind for a bit- hope you
guys don&#39;t mind, because I&#39;ll be using this stuff over and over
again.

Or not- it&#39;s all up to you. Tell you what- post in the thread; vote in
the poll. Tell me if this one&#39;s another showstopper, or if I should
change something about it.

In any case, I pulled another all-nighter with this one. I&#39;m turning in.

Peace up; A-town down.</pre>
