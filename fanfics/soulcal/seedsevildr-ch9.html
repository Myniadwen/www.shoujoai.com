<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../soulcal/seedsevildr-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Learn to control people and manipulate events not by force, but by 
words and actions, so that you can obtain a goal without having to 
resort to any manner of fight. Use people&#39;s desires, needs, and wants 
against them. Humans need security, wealth, pride, strength, and to 
have their lust satisfied. Use this against them.

This is the true path of the ninja. Use the tools given to gain entry,
not to attack. Use the powders and explosives given to distract and
deter in a fight, if it comes down to one. And in the end, escape with 
what is needed while the enemy is in confusion.

Shadow War (Part 2)
________________________________________________________________________

&quot;Are we there *yet*?&quot; Xianghua complained for the umpteenth time.

Apparently, she wasn&#39;t lying when she said she did not enjoy these long 
hauls too much. The hours and hours they had spent walking -no, make 
that running- from the temple to the base of the mountain range to the 
east were tiring. She was suddenly lifted off of her feet and found
herself about three or four feet off the ground.

&quot;Thanks, Kilik.&quot; The young monk smiled down at his &#39;sister&#39; before
continuing forward. He may have not loved her in that way, but he still
cared for her as if she were family. The serious and determined monk
continued running forward as such, the Kali-Yuga slung across his back
and Chai Xianghua in his arms. As he looked at her, he remembered his
other sister...

(Talim was right. She looks *exactly* like her. Same eyes, same face...
if her hair were longer, she would fit the description perfectly.)
This thought however, did not bring him much comfort. Still,
he pressed onward, ignoring the flash of guilt that came over him.
He had to do something about the current situation before going any
further.

Meanwhile, Mi-na and Talim were keeping pace almost perfectly, running
after Taki with an equal speed. The two of them had been trained, like
Xianghua, since childhood. However, they had something different
driving them instead of just their footwork. That something different
was what Xianghua was lacking, in a way.

The two of them had a sheer and undaunting will. They forced their
bodies to move faster, not bothering to worry about how long it would
take to reach their desination. They would continue running until their
bodies failed them; and even then, they would call on their reserves.
Xianghua had less mental training than the two of them did...

It did not make her weak in any way, but it was still a fact. The
training she had gotten from the retired general would help a bit, but
it would not entirely do what it had for her other companions, who
had gone the same training that she had brought herself through for 
years.

But then again, it was enough that she was continuing on, with all 
that had happened in the past few days.

However, that was quickly set aside as they made their way through the
forest, heading ever closer towards the much colder peaks in the
Kyoto area. According to Taki&#39;s intelligence, the  anti-Toki faction
of the clan had taken refuge within the mountain ranges in order to 
have a better chance of reconnaisance against the other camp.

Their base was not too far now, Taki assured the group.

&quot;They should be somewhere around here, if I&#39;m not mistaken. We should
be running into them any minute now-&quot;

A series of blurs and sparks later, and Taki had deflected a series 
of throwing stars headed for the group. Everyone stopped where they
were as a voice called out, seemingly from nowhere and everywhere at
the same time.

&quot;State your business. Otherwise, turn back the way you came.&quot;

Mi-na couldn&#39;t help but look around, searching for the voice. Her
grip tightened on the Scarlet Thunder as she did so, her body
drawing tight in preparation to move as quickly as humanly possible.
Xianghua and Kilik instincively drew their weapons, ready for another
projectile assault. The only two who showed any calm were Talim
and Taki.

Taki knew who the voice belonged to. Talim did not, but she knew 
where it came from, thanks to the winds. Besides, she did not think 
of the voice as a threat, and their temporary guide had sucessfully 
deflected any attack coming toward them. She trusted in the ninja&#39;s 
ability to do so again, and thus halted her body&#39;s response.

The ninja responded not long after the voice had spoken. &quot;We are 
neither friends, nor foes. We&#39;re simply messengers. It would 
interest you to know that the man who was once called Toki is 
dead...&quot;

Utter silence followed. For a few good minutes, nothing happened.

&quot;Well?&quot; Mi-na asked, a bit apprehensive. &quot;Did they even hear us? You
took him out, just like we saw there. They can ask us for themselves
and stop hiding like scared little-&quot;

They came from everywhere. The forest was suddenly teeming with
demon slayers dressed in black, red, brown, grey, white... they wore
different colors and styles of clothing, but their methods were the
same. These were the Fu-Ma who had gotten tired of Toki&#39;s errant
ways and wanted to stage a coup against him.

&quot;You were saying, Mi-na?&quot; Taki inquired, smirking without turning 
her head towards the woman in question.

One of them, a man with dark brown hair tied back into a warrior&#39;s
ponytail, and hazel eyes with an eyepatch over the right one walked 
towards the group, examining the four travelers who had come with 
their assassin. He was clean-shaven; muscular, yet lean from his
training. Taki guessed that he was probably in his late twenties, 
perhaps early thirties. 

As the man gave them all a once-over he spoke, his comments 
directed towards Taki. &quot;We&#39;ll need time to confirm this. For now, 
since you came back alive, I&#39;ll assume that the job is finished. 
With that in consideration... we have to make our next move against 
the faction that supported Toki.

As for the pieces of Soul Edge... are they still in the temple?&quot;

Taki nodded. The man rubbed his chin in thought, then nodded.
&quot;We&#39;re going to get rid of the annoying shards of metal that have
tainted our clan so. But we can&#39;t destroy them entirely- that&#39;s 
already been shown from the beginning. Not to mention that we
have no means or methods to purify such fragments. I&#39;m
guessing this is where your... companions come in.&quot;

He looked towards them again, bowing slightly. &quot;Forgive our earlier
avoidance of you... we can&#39;t entirely trust anyone these days.
There are evil influences everywhere, and we have to be careful.&quot;
Mi-na sighed in relief and lowered her zhanmadao. The others took
it as a cue to sheathe their various weapons.

&quot;Nah, it&#39;s okay. I suppose we should explain ourselves anyway.
But first- how about somewhere to rest for a while? We haven&#39;t
exactly had the best trip over here, after all.&quot; Xianghua sighed
and almost slumped to the ground, grateful to Mi-na for her
suggestion.

&quot;Certainly. Just follow us- we have somewhere that will probably
be all right for you all. After a bit of rest, you&#39;ll have to
introduce yourselves formally.&quot;

Mi-na nodded and smiled warmly. &quot;Hey, lead the way.&quot; A voice
popped up in her head- Xianghua&#39;s. She sounded a bit repentant.

(Sorry for all that. I was just really tired from what we went
through with that crazy girl, not to mention having to walk all
that time through China...)

Mi-na smiled to herself and replied without looking back, their 
communication unheard by even Talim. Not like she minded in the
least- everyone had their moments when they needed privacy.

(Hey, you know I&#39;m always looking out for you guys. But this time,
I think I&#39;ll have you owe me for this one. I&#39;m sure you can think
of some way to repay me, right?)

Xianghua grinned. She did indeed have a way... but she hid her
thoughts for the moment. Mi-na didn&#39;t need to know everything 
that she planned, after all. However, she did awnser her with
(Yup! I can definitely manage that.)

A smile from Mi-na, seeming as if she were content that everything
were going well, was her only awnser.
________________________________________________________________________

It was quite some time before they reached the shinto shrine in
the nearby mountains; the sun had begun to sink below the horizon by
the time the torii -the gateway to the shrine grounds- was in sight.
Talim could somehow feel a contentment in this place- no one had
disturbed it and no evil had passed through it.

She couldn&#39;t help but wonder how this was possible... until that
is, she walked through the gateway. She could feel the air thicken and 
tighten around her, as if something were trying to stifle her. Then, 
just as quickly, the moment had passed.

&quot;Did you guys feel-&quot; Mi-na nodded. Xianghua and Kilik said nothing.
&quot;Yeah, I did. That was a barrier we just went through. If we were
taken by Soul Edge, it&#39;d definitely be bad news... I don&#39;t exactly
know what would happen, but it wouldn&#39;t be good.&quot;

Talim nodded, and tried to think of what would occur if any one of
them tried to walk onto these grounds while under posession of
such a force. Would the barrier break? Would it cleanse the evil and
leave the one who tried to enter unharmed? Would they be repelled;
perhaps with injury?

She shook her head at the last thought. No matter what they did,
no one deserved to be hurt. All life was sacred to her- it was
how she was raised and taught, and she believed it almost to a fault.
She closed her eyes and took a deep breath as she walked forward,
Spreading her arms outward...

And the wind- the pure, untainted air within the grounds- flowed
into her; through her. Talim smiled in contentment and stopped where
she was, raising her head to the skies as she took it all in. Power
and energy pulsed within her, and the whispers of the spirits that 
resided here passed through her mind.

As she exhaled and opened her eyes, she saw Taki and Mi-na in front
of her. Mi-na wore a smile, while Taki&#39;s face had a slight curiousity
to it. Her voice betrayed nothing else besides the question she wanted
to ask. &quot;Just what are you? For a moment there, I could have sworn
you had lifted yourself from the ground.&quot;

Talim blinked, and looked towards Mi-na, who nodded. &quot;I guess I did,
didn&#39;t I? I certainly didn&#39;t know. If that&#39;s the case, then the winds
must favor me in this place.&quot; Taki quirked an eyebrow. (So then that
meditation earlier... and the aura I felt...) After a bit, she nodded.

&quot;All right, then. So you can speak with the winds and use them as an
extention of your own body. And in exchange for their help, what do 
you give in return?&quot; There was always a price for someone who could 
channel an element or their own energy. Talim smiled, understanding 
the question for what it was and awnsering in kind.

&quot;I give the only thing that I can. Myself. My body is what the winds
wish it to be; does what they wish it to do. In exchange, I have their
power and their knowledge from the world beyond. At least, that&#39;s
what I was taught.&quot; Mi-na nodded and Taki shrugged. &quot;Interesting.
Just to let you know, you have quite the potential to generate great
amounts of spiritual force... I suggest you keep yourself strong-willed 
in order not to succumb to any influences on your mind.&quot;

With that, she walked away.

Mi-na sighed and shook her head. &quot;She does like to state the obvious,
huh?&quot; Talim shook her head and smiled. &quot;I think she said it because *I*
needed to know; because I didn&#39;t know. And I didn&#39;t. I just do what
comes naturally to me. I don&#39;t even know what she&#39;s talking about...

But I&#39;ll keep it in mind. It&#39;s good advice, I think.&quot;

Mi-na nodded and smiled warmly. &quot;Yeah. If anything else, she knows what
she&#39;s talking about. Come on, let&#39;s get moving.&quot; As she spoke, the
Korean extended her hand towards Talim, that same smile on her face.
The young shaman-in-training nodded, but did not take her hand.

Instead, she stepped in close, wrapping one of her arms around the
Seong progidy&#39;s waist. Mi-na took it in stride, loosely draping the
extended arm around the young woman&#39;s shoulders.

With that, and a warm chuckle from the older woman, they headed towards
the shrine.
________________________________________________________________________

Taki and about eight of those who seemed to be the leaders of this
coup were sitting in one of the rooms. The doors were sealed with ofuda,
the incantations written on them harmless to those who touched them.
However, the doors could not be opened or penetrated, due to the barrier
formed, and no sound came from or into the room.

The conversation that was held would not be overheard, no matter how
hard one tried. Then again, no one was an enemy here... there were just
four people who were complete strangers. So yes, the seals were needed.

&quot;So then,&quot; the man from earlier spoke, &quot;Let&#39;s make ourselves known
to each other first. I am Ookamikingin, leader of these who would be
called rogues... were Toki in power. But according to you, he is no
longer so; nor is he alive.&quot; Taki nodded, her face expressionless.
&quot;That&#39;s right. As you can see, it was harder than it looked.&quot;

The scars on her body were evidence enough of the struggle, just as
she said. However, she looked unfazed by them. &quot;I see,&quot; Ookamikingin
replied. &quot;Still, we need to do reconnaisance on whether his body is
still there or not.&quot; The kunoichi nodded again, her features stony
and unreadable.

A woman with black hair and blue eyes spoke- one of three women on 
this council of leaders. &quot;My name is Kishiumi. I&#39;ve checked out your 
history from our information network. I can&#39;t begin to imagine how 
conflicted you were when you had to fight someone who was a mentor 
to you... But I do sympathise.&quot;

Taki lowered her head, letting her bangs fall over her eyes. 
She suddenly felt like yelling at someone. Bursting into tears and
screaming in heated anger, (How can you sympathise? You weren&#39;t there
when I was forced to kill him!!) It was all unfair, how these things 
happened. She was twenty-nine years old, had a successful run as a 
demon huntress, had survived constant battles and attempts 
at capture...

And she felt like bursting out with emotion. Why did she get angry over
a man who was dead? He was no longer the man he was, back when she was
younger. Within, he was probably sufferring. She had to kill him- just
to give her former master mercy. Why was she angry at this woman?

She calmed herself after a few brief moments, her face retaining its
coldness. &quot;No... you can&#39;t. And thank you.&quot; She did not refuse the
sympathy; not when she felt like running off somewhere and crying
until she could do so no more. But she kept her emotions within an
iron grip- she had to be strong.

Instead of simply nodding however, Kishiumi... smiled. Warmly, 
gracefully. &quot;Come... there is no need to hide your feelings. You
are among allies and comrades here; there is no need to hold things
in.&quot;

Though the emotions had passed, Taki nodded. It had been a long time
since she could trust someone; open herself to others. At times, she
wondered to herself whether or not she was losing her humanity- her
ability to feel anything at all. She couldn&#39;t stop the rush of fear
that flowed through her every time she thought of it.

To lose one&#39;s emotions... was to have an empty soul. Though it was
free of evil and pain, it was no better than being possessed by a
demon. &quot;I will... try to do so from now on.&quot;

Ookamikingin continued onward, the talk between the two women ended
for now. &quot;Well then... you will have to explain what role your
companions have in this. As far as I can tell, two of them are
from China, while one is Korean. Both are Japan&#39;s enemies at the
current time. While we have no quarrel with Toyotomi, we need
not draw his attention.&quot;

Taki nodded and explained herself. &quot;They are on a journey in order
to silence the cursed sword, Soul Edge, once and for all. I was told
of their plight and agreed to help in whatever way I could. In
exchange, they have agreed to help resolve this matter to the best
of their ability.&quot;

The man nodded and stroked his chin. &quot;What exactly can they do? Have
you discerned their abilities?&quot; Taki shook her head. &quot;I have no
possible idea what they are capable of. I have fought one of them, 
the Korean woman, quite a few times before. She is skilled in battle, 
but I don&#39;t know what other changes she has undergone.&quot;

The others seemed to mull over this for a moment. Finally, another
one spoke. This man seemed to be younger- one of the youngest,
actually. He seemed in fact, no older than thirteen or so; a
child in comparison to some of his older couterparts. Brown hair,
blue eyes, and a serious expression on his face as he considered
the options before him.

&quot;We&#39;ll take them. We need all the help we can get.&quot; Taki looked
toward the young man and quirked an eyebrow, showing the first hints
of either puzzlement, or disbelief. (He&#39;s just a child,) she thought
to herself, but she didn&#39;t speak. However, the younger member smiled,
reading her face as easily as her thoughts.

&quot;Let me guess. My age is a problem for you, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Taki&#39;s eyes
widened. He had either read her thoughts, or read her face. Either
way, the slightest slip in her composure had probably been seen
by this young one. Bringing her expression back to a neutral one,
Taki shook her head. &quot;Not anymore.&quot;

The child shrugged. &quot;Either way, my name&#39;s Kageboushi. I guess
you could say I&#39;m a bit young to be on this council, but let&#39;s
not make assumptions here. I&#39;m tougher than I look.&quot; Taki
couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at this. He certainly spoke like
a child, but she could not doubt that he was skilled, at least 
in reading body language and observing situations.

&quot;I can see that. Well then, it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you.&quot; Kishiumi&#39;s
smile brightened. It was good to see the quite famous Taki smile and
laugh as she did just then- neither malisciously or derisively.
It was a sign that she could be trusted; at least, to her it was.

The young boy rested his hands on his chin and looked at Taki 
quizzically. &quot;So then, what did you plan on doing with those guys?
They don&#39;t seem like the type that&#39;d be any good at ninjustu...&quot;

Taki smiled. &quot;That&#39;s what we&#39;re here to discuss, isn&#39;t it? I have
a few ideas...&quot;
________________________________________________________________________

By the time the meeting was over and everyone was rested, everyone
was told to meet in the main hall. There were about fifty members
of the clan within the building in no less than half an hour, and
sitting before them were the eight council members. Behind those eight
seated officers stood Mi-na, Talim, Xianghua, Taki, and Kilik. The 
young Chinese woman tried not to gape as she took in the many people 
here who could probably kill her without blinking or moving that much.

To say that she was nervous was an understatement.

Mi-na however, was used to it. Talim sensed no intent to strike, so
she had no qualms about there being so many. Kilik, as usual, held
his composure and stood still. He could hold himself in any situation,
which made Xianghua a bit jealous.

Still, as long as the others were with her, she would be just fine.
At least, she hoped so.

Ookamikingin stood from his seat, looking noble as he wore a royal 
blue hakama with a kimono of the same color, a golden obi tied 
underneath, and a white haori that hung down to mid-thigh. His geta
boots were black, as if they contrasted the brighter colors in order
to mark the man as a ninja. As he spoke, the hall fell into silence.

&quot;We have recieved word,&quot; he spoke in a resounding voice, &quot;That Toki,
the man who has betrayed us all with his irrational and dishonorable
behavior, has been slain. While we have little evidence of this as
of yet, I will have Kageboushi lead a team into Hoko Temple to the
east, to determine whether or not the man has perished.

In the meantime, we have to focus on the re-unification of our clan.
This division will only destroy both sides in the end, with nothing
gained and all but our lives lost to us- those that escape death,
that is.&quot;

He was silent for a moment, taking time to let the words sink in.
&quot;I understand that you are not afraid to die... but consider this.
If we die... who will stand up to the evils of this world? Who has
the strength to combat that which the eye cannot see, or the ear
cannot hear? Who has the will and drive in these times in order to
face this hidden threat?

If not us, then who?&quot;

Many nodded, their faces showing solemn determination.

&quot;No, we cannot stand aside and allow ourselves to be hunted forever.
We&#39;re going to reunite the clan and continue to uphold our oath and
solemn vow- to eliminate the presence of darkness and evil from
this world; to strike at the shadows from the shadows. This is both
fate and destiny for us, and we will not turn aside from it!&quot;

Applause broke out in the hall, cheers and shouts of exuberance
rocking the very foundations. Mi-na and the others were swept away
by the sheer wave of emotion, and couldn&#39;t help but be fired up
as well. This was *exactly* what the four of them needed to 
effectively combat the waves of demons that had risen to the call
of Soul Edge- now, if only they could get them to cooperate with 
their mission in some way.

Raising his hands to call for silence, Ookamikingin spoke once
again. &quot;The four people behind me, along with Taki, have agreed to
help us with our plight to the best of their ability. Starting
tomorrow, they must be integrated into our clan in order for them 
to aid our cause. Accept them; respect them; be favorable towards 
them in all things. For in these times, our allies are few,
and we need all the help we can get.&quot;

They all agreed, some of them waving towards the newcomers, others
simply acknowlegding them with a nod, and nothing more. Many had
heard by now of the four of them, and wondered what they were about.
In any event, the council leader nodded and looked them all over
one final time.

&quot;Rest now all four of you. Rest easy with the knowledge that no 
harm will come to you this evening, as long as you are under the
protection of the Fu-Ma clan. This is our solemn vow to each of 
you.&quot; The council members nodded, each looking at them with a
different expression. Kageboushi looked at them with an air
of curiousity, while Kishiumi gave them a friendly smile. The
rest simply looked them over, only agreeing to the vow.

&quot;Now then,&quot; Ookami spoke as he turned towards the rest of the clan.
&quot;To rest, or to whatever you desire. Do not forget however, that
we must be watchful. Enemies are everywhere, and the only ones
we can trust in are each other. Good night and sleep soundly.
You are dismissed.&quot;

To Be Continued...
________________________________________________________________________

Yup, there it goes again. Of course, this should prove to be a most
interesting thing indeed, putting in more of my original characters
into the mix. Here are a few translations of names, just in case you
all were wondering.

Ookamikingin- &quot;Wolf of Gold and Silver&quot;
Kageboushi- &quot;Silhouette&quot;
Kishiumi- &quot;Last Child of the Sea&quot;

Now then... there you have it.

Review, please. No muss, no fuss, just feedback.
