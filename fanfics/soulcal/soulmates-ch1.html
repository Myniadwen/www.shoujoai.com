<h1>Soul Mates (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/xenolord.html">Xenolord</a><br> </h2>
<pre>::Two Years Later::

Something was wrong. But only horribly wrong this time. It had been two 
years since she had felt Soul Edge&#39;s tug on her. It was... disturbing 
that it would resurface after all these long, peaceful years.
She hated it. She didn&#39;t want Soul Edge to regain control of her. Not 
after what it did to her last time. She took hold of her ring and put it 
around her waist.

&quot;Tira...&quot; The old man asked. She had been staying with him on and off 
for the past two years. He&#39;d been good to her. &quot;Where are you going?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know... Some thing&#39;s not right... Do you know Soul Edge?&quot;

&quot;I know of it, why?&quot; He replied, coming in from the kitchen.

&quot;I used to be... controlled by that sword. I thought, after it was 
destroyed, I could find peace... but not now. I sense it... somewhere 
far away...&quot; Tira responded, pushing her sleeves up.

&quot;So... you&#39;re going to go... find it?&quot; He asked, uncertainty in his 
voice.

&quot;Yes. Find it. And destroy it. Once and for all. I&#39;ll never be a pawn 
again.&quot; The man smiled. This is what he wanted to hear. He walked to 
Tira and hugged her.

&quot;Okay, then. You do what you&#39;ve got to do. I&#39;ll be here when you get 
back. Be safe.&quot; He spoke. Tira returned the man&#39;s hug and nodded.

&quot;Will do. Don&#39;t wait up for me.&quot; She walked out, her Blade Ring around 
her waiste.

She went down to the docks and spoke to one of the Ship&#39;s captains, a 
man she got to know over the years. He was your stereotypical salty sea 
dog.

&quot;Yarr...&quot; He spoke as she approached. &quot;What can I do fer ye, Tira?&quot; He 
asked as she approached. She stood on the dock and waved.

&quot;Permission to come aboard, captain!&quot; She asked. The old captain 
grinned.

&quot;Yer always welcome aboard me ship, Tira. Ye know that!&quot; He responded, 
dropping the gangplank.

&quot;I know. But if I don&#39;t ask, you never drop the plank!&quot; She joked 
climbing on. The man laughed.

&quot;Ye never cease to give me a laugh, do ye, Tira? So, what can I do fer 
ye?&quot; Tira set her sights west, from where the power was coming from.

&quot;I need passage west. To whatever is out there.&quot; Tira responded. The 
captain hushed.

&quot;Ye need ta go ta the New World, do ye?&quot; He eyed her suspiciously. 

&quot;Plannin&#39; on makin&#39; yerself rich on me back, are ye?&quot; He smiled.

&quot;I sense Soul Edge out there. I need to destroy it before it gets a hold 
of me again.&quot; She responded.

&quot;Arr, Soul Edge, ye say? Well, I can&#39;t have me favorite first mate bein&#39; 
possessed by no Cursed Blade, now can we? Ta the New World, ye say? Well 
then, we must make our haste, shant we?&quot; He signaled the sailor on the 
mast. &quot;Lower the mast, maties! We make for ta sea!&quot; He shouted.

&quot;Aye, Captain!&quot; The man responded, untieing the ropes which bound the 
mast in a roll. Tira smiled happily.

&quot;Thank you, Captain. I&#39;ll be sure to be quick so you can be home before 
to long.&quot; She sat on one of the rope rolls on the deck.

&quot;Arrr... Come now, Tira. Ye know me home is the Lady of the Sea!&quot; He 
laughed as the ship, aptly named The Lady of the Sea, pulled out into 
open waters.

The voyage was long and arduous. The Lady of the Sea was the fastest 
ship that was available, and that would truly be put to the test if Tira 
was to get to the Soul Edge before Nightmare did. The ship pulled along 
side a dock that had been recently constructed. The total time of the 
voyage was around three and a half weeks. Three and a half weeks on a 
ship with two dozen sweaty men made Tira slightly nauseous for half the 
voyage, but for the most part, it was enjoyable.

&quot;Yarr... that be strange...&quot; The Captain spoke as the ship was fully 
docked. &quot;Ain&#39;t no body on this here land save fer the savages. And I 
know no savages can build a dock to berth me ship...&quot; He continued. &quot;Oh 
well. Let us not dwell on the superfluous. Will ye be disembarking now, 
Tira?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Thank you, Captain.&quot;

&quot;It be me pleasure. Sadly, we cannot wait fer ye. Our supplies will only 
last to get back. But, we will return then. Until we meet again, fair ye 
well.&quot; He turned his attention back to the man on the mast. &quot;Avast ye 
dogs! Pull away and make fer the sea! We must return home quickly!&quot; The 
ship pulled away and turned towards the horizen. Tira watched it fade 
away before continuing.

Soul Edge&#39;s signature was strong now. It was near. Maybe this wouldn&#39;t 
take as long as she had thought. It felt like it was coming from just 
over those mountains... She was never much one for mountain climbing, 
but she had some experience. Climbing without a harness was dangerous, 
but Tira was used to danger. Especially dangerous danger. The strange 
thing was, the foot and hand holds were almost placed there...

Not dwelling too hard on the superfluous, as the good captain had 
recommended, she continued upwards. Soon, she could start to see the 
top. As her hand hit the top of the mountain, she realized it wasn&#39;t a 
mountain at all, but a mesa. The near-sheer cliff face gave way to a 
smooth, horizontal ground. At which, a huge mansion was situated on the 
top. Soul Edge&#39;s signature was coming form inside.

&quot;Strange...&quot; She muttered, looking over the house. &quot;Is this the work of 
primative savages? No... it&#39;s much too civilized...&quot; She continued 
speaking to herself. Soul Edge was definetely inside. She had to find 
it. Approaching the door, she began to here something from within. She 
opened the door and stepped in. The parlor was well-lit, several dozen 
candles hanging from chandeliers and attached to fixtures gave the room 
a cool, noon-sun feel. Inside, seated around a table, were eight other 
women.

&quot;Well, that makes nine. So if my calculations are correct, the last 
chair is reserved for our host...&quot; A woman with pure white hair growled. 
&quot;I hate being kept in the dark.&quot; Her accent was thick, prehaps a bit 
overdone, but it was unmistakably british.

&quot;You worry too much. Let&#39;s get our new friend up-to-date, hum?&quot; Another 
groaned. This one had short, neatly kept brown hair. Her manner of dress 
suggested a woman of royal Japanese decent, but her manner of speech and 
facial features suggested eastern European. She sat on one of the 
chairs, twirling an ornamental umbrella around on her shoulder.

&quot;I&#39;ll start. Which one lured you in? Money? Power? Soul Edge?&quot; A rather 
bubbling woman in a floral Chinese dress asked. Her brown hair was 
slightly shorter then the other woman&#39;s, and equally neatly kept. Her 
green silk pants were a bit flashy. Tira seemed to remember snipits of 
this woman, but never learned her name.

&quot;I sensed Soul Edge here... What&#39;s going on?&quot; Tira asked, her voice 
elevating to the point of concern.

&quot;You&#39;ve been sent for a ruse. Soul Edge isn&#39;t here. We&#39;ve looked. Trust 
us, we&#39;ve looked.&quot; A forth woman growled aggitatedly. Her brown, unruly 
hair was marginally contained by a decrotive band across her head. &quot;I 
think introductions are in order, hum?&quot; The first woman, the one with 
the thick british accent nodded. &quot;Okay. My name&#39;s Seong Mi-Na. I came 
here thinking I could get some money to support my family. The one to my 
right with the very threatening glare is Setsuka. No reason why she&#39;s 
here. Won&#39;t tell anyone. That&#39;s Isabel...&quot; She read the first woman&#39;s 
stare of death, and corrected herself. &quot;Ivy... Doesn&#39;t like being called 
Isabella, so don&#39;t call her that.&quot; She moved to the woman across from 
her. &quot;I forgot your name, little one. Ya know, what, that&#39;s your new 
name. Little One.&quot; Mi-Na smiled

&quot;It&#39;s Talim. If I&#39;ve told you once, I&#39;ve told you a million times. 
Ta-Lim. Get it right.&quot; The younger woman huffed, crossing her arms, 
visably insulted. &quot;Anyway, I&#39;m Talim. Nice to meet you.&quot;

&quot;Yea... okay. That&#39;s Xianghua next to me.&quot; The woman in the floral 
Chineses dress smiled and waved.

&quot;Hiya!&quot; She replied, a grin crossing her face.

&quot;I am Sophitia, and this is my sister, Cassandra.&quot; A rather regal 
looking woman Tira had overlooked initially spoke, waving. The younger 
sibling Cassandra said nothing, just waved.

&quot;Has anyone seen Taki?&quot; Ivy asked, looking about. Suddenly, one of the 
chandeliers collapsed and fell onto the table. &quot;Holy!&quot; Everyone shouted 
in near unison.

&quot;I knew it! I can spot shoddy construction a mile away!&quot; A ninth voice 
pipped up. Everyone looked up to see a woman&#39;s face looking at them 
through a hole in the roof. &quot;Oh, hello. New girls. How long have I been 
UP here?&quot;

&quot;&#39;Bout an hour.&quot; Xianghua replied. The woman in the roof shrugged and 
slipped down the hole.

&quot;Hi, everyone I didn&#39;t meet earlier. I&#39;m Taki. Ninja.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s the only shmuck that came here willingly. Or knowingly, at 
least.&quot; Before they could continue, a door to the south opened, and a 
woman in an apron and a black gown stepped out.

&quot;Welcome, everyone.&quot; She spoke. Everyone instantly had their questions. 
They all stood and began asking in unison. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all very 
interested to know why you&#39;re all here, and we will get to that. But 
first, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Valeria. Aspirering 
scientist and world-renowned Alchemist. Now, about your questions...&quot;

&quot;Why have you brought us all here?!&quot; Talim asked. Everyone nodded.

&quot;An excellent question. The answer is, I need your help for a little... 
experiment. You see, I believe that confinement away from family and 
friends will lead to humans doing things they wouldn&#39;t normally do under 
common circumstances. For instance, turning enemies and unknowns into 
friends. You all are relative strangers to one another, which is why I 
chose you. Here is what will happen. I will state my case, and after 
that, you may leave if you wish.&quot; Valeria finished. Everyone looked at 
her.

&quot;Here is what I would propose. I will seal all ten of us into this very 
house. Here, we will all spend three weeks confined within. I will 
moniter your progress, using my own three week stay here as the control 
group. That is all I ask. You will go about your daily lives, as if 
nothing happened, and I will observe.&quot;

&quot;Is that your case, then?&quot; Taki asked. Valeria nodded. &quot;Good. I&#39;m out of 
here. See ya.&quot; She stood and walked to the door, followed by just about 
everyone else.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I mentioned the compensation for your time...&quot; Valeria 
spoke up. &quot;I am willing to pay you, each, three million gold pieces for 
your time.&quot;

&quot;Whoa, what, huh?&quot; Taki muttered, stopping at the door. &quot;Three 
million?!&quot; She asked. Valeria nodded. &quot;Each?!&quot; She asked again. Another 
nod. &quot;None of this &#39;split between us&#39; shit?&quot;

&quot;Well, should one of you opt out now, or any time during the experiment, 
then your share will be slip amongst the survivors.&quot; She spoke. &quot;But, 
for the most part, if you all stay the course, yes, you will all receive 
three million gold each. What do you say?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m in.&quot; Everyone droned in unison. Valeria smiled.

&quot;Fantastic. If I may show you all to your rooms.&quot; She motioned to the 
stairs.

The ascended the stairs, and came to a long hall way with four doors on 
either side, and a door at the end.

&quot;You will notice that your room doors have your names emblazoned on 
them. They are in revers alphabetical order, so, Mrs. Valentine, your 
room is at the end, and Xianghua, yours is here.&quot; Valeria motioned to 
the door on her right. &quot;Now, you&#39;re all grown women, so I don&#39;t have to 
set any ground rules, or anything like that. There is, however one rule 
I must stress the importance of. The door you all saw me make my 
entrance from, under no circumstances should you enter that door. There 
are very sensitive materials beyond it, that I do not wish contaminated. 
You all understand, surly.&quot; There came a general nod of concensus. &quot;Most 
excellent. Well, I must be off. I shall leave you nine to your own 
devices.&quot; She turned and began down the stairs. &quot;Ah, before I leave...&quot; 
She stopped herself. &quot;If ever you need me, simply ring the bell on the 
table once, and only once. I shall get to you as soon as possible. If 
ever you wish out of this experiment, you must only ring the bell on the 
table three times, and you will be on your way. But, you will forfeit 
your cut. Understood?&quot; Another nod. &quot;Great. Kitchen is down the stairs 
to the left, you will all find several changes of clothing within your 
rooms. I hope the styling is to your liking.&quot; With that said, Valeria 
descended the stairs and walked back through the door she warned them 
not to open.

&quot;Well, I think it&#39;s high-time we all turned in. I don&#39;t know about you, 
but I&#39;m whipped.&quot; Setsuka yawned loudly, stretching her arms. Tira found 
her eyes migrating around the room, looking at her roommates for the 
next three weeks. All older women, except Talim. She looked, if not her 
age, close enough. Why was she even here? Experiment beside, surly 
Valeria could have found a better canditate then a nineteen year old 
girl having an identity crisis. Not wanting to think on it, Tira simply 
settled to enter her room.

The door had a gold plaque on it which read in very neat writing &quot;Tira&quot;. 
The room was medium sized, with a double bed placed against the back 
wall. A window allowed her a fine view of the setting sun. There was a 
closet occupying one wall, and a foot locker at the foot of her bed.
She walked to the closet and opened it. Just as Valeria had described, 
there were four or five outfits, all around Tira&#39;s size. Whoever her 
source was, they were good. She smiled at the handywork. Pulling one of 
the hangers from the closet, she checked it against herself. It looked 
like a formal gown. Seemed like everything was here, sleeping clothes, 
formal gown, and three sets of different everyday wear, plus the outfit 
on her back, so four.

Before she got dressed for bed, a small, almost frightened knock beset 
her door. &quot;That&#39;ll probably be Talim...&quot; she thought to herself, going 
to the door. Right as rain, Talim was standing on the other side, a 
timid smile on her lips.

&quot;H... Hi.&quot; She greeted Tira. Tira responded.

&quot;Hey. What&#39;s up?&quot; Talim took her time answering.

&quot;I.... Well... I never learned your name. I just thought it would be 
rude of me to live with you, and never learn your name.&quot; Talim 
responded, gaining a bit of her confidence back. Tira smiled and opened 
the door more.

&quot;It&#39;s Tira.&quot; She answered. &quot;Talim, right?&quot; The girl on the other side 
nodded.

&quot;You remembered. That&#39;s a first.&quot;

&quot;You want to come in?&quot; Tira asked, offering her entrance. Talim shook 
her head.

&quot;Oh, I couldn&#39;t keep you from bed. You&#39;ve probably had a long trip...&quot;

&quot;Psh.&quot; Was Tira&#39;s response. &quot;Come in. I slept enough for three people on 
the boat.&quot; Talim smiled, nodded and stepped in, closing the door behind 
her.

&quot;Oh, wow! You&#39;ve got a nice view! All I&#39;ve got is trees...&quot; Talim 
growled some, looking out the window. &quot;So...&quot; She continued, trying to 
make for some conversation. &quot;Where are you from?&quot;

&quot;I never really knew.&quot; Tira responded right off. Talim was taken aback. 
&quot;I&#39;ve been under the control of Soul Edge for as long as I can remember. 
I was freed only a couple of years ago. I actually came here trying to 
destroy Soul Edge, so I&#39;d never fall victim again, so, viola. Here I 
am.&quot; Tira smiled, opening her arms to the room. &quot;You?&quot; Talim&#39;s eyes 
widened, and a blush crossed her cheeks.

&quot;Oh... you don&#39;t want to know my past. It&#39;s not nearly as exciting as 
yours...&quot;

&quot;Trust me. A little of the mundane would be a welcome reprieve.&quot;

&quot;Well... okay.&quot; The girl finally opened up. &quot;I&#39;m a priestess of the 
Winds. I come from a temple in China. It&#39;s supposed to be the birthplace 
of the Trade Wind. I came here, because the winds told me to.&quot;

&quot;Wow. I&#39;d love to have the winds talk to me. All they ever say to me is 
when someone&#39;s had too much cheese.&quot; Tira joked. Talim picked it up 
instantly and laughed, the rest of her uneasyness passing.

&quot;I like you. You&#39;re funny...&quot; Talim looked out the window once more, 
just in time to see the sun disappear over the horizon. &quot;Oh... I should 
probably be going. Sl... sleep well, Tira.&quot; Talim responded, going for 
the door.

&quot;I will. You too.&quot; Tira opened the door and saw Talim bolt across the 
now dark hall into her room across the way. Yawning once more, Tira 
returned to her bed to sleep. She had not bothered with her sleep wear. 
Her current clothes were dirty, but they&#39;d last one more night.</pre>
