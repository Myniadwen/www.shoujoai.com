<h1>The Seeds of Evil: Dragon Rising (part 4 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../soulcal/seedsevildr-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>The year 1592.

The Warring States Era had come to a close, and the nation of Japan
was about to become united under one flag by none other than Toyotomi
Hideyoshi, general of Nobunaga Oda. After setting up an elaborate
citadel in the capital, Kyoto, and and an almost impregnable castle
within the city, he began a series of campaigns against China, a 
nation that was currently in its most powerful and influential age- 
the Ming Dynasty.

However, he ran into trouble...

His first landing point was Korea, under the rule of Seonjo,
the current king of the Joeseon Dynasty. As Japanese envoys asked for
passage to China... the Koreans, who were actively allied with the
Ming Dynasty, took it as a declaration of war. Effectively, they were
right. Toyotomi had never intended to land peacefully, and the Seven
Year War had begun.

However, the Japanese forces had overwhelmed the Korean armies on the
ground. With their superior firearms technology, they decimated the
ranks of the defenders, laying waste to two cities as they pushed toward
the capital. With each step they took, the people began to become
increasingly worried about the future of their country...

The battles on the sea were a different story.

Admiral Yi Sun-sin and his coast guard had effectively staged a
series of guerilla tactics on the Japanese Navy, and after a series
of surgical strikes, had most certainly gained the advantage. The
fierce battle of Hansan-do was about to begin... the battle that would
decimate an entire Japanese force with only a limited number of ships.

It would be a disgrace for one nation, and a source of pride for
another. However, it was not going to be Japan&#39;s only problem.

The Murakami clan&#39;s navy had made their decision to rebel against the
mainland. They would neither be subverted, nor subdued. They would
fight, and continue their proud existance as pirates and men of the sea.
With that, the age of blades and battle would resume anew, accompanied
by the sounds of rifle shots.

And yet, another power was on the move in Japan.

The Fu-Ma no Sato, a clan of ninja with supernatural abilities and
extreme skill, were demon hunters. They had been ordered to find and
collect as many pieces of the corrupt blade, Soul Edge, as possible.
However, a recent change in the structure of the clan has taken place,
causing a shift in their orders.

Toki, their leader, had gone insane... and the ninja are in disarray.
Information that was leaked to the clan about the location of certain
fragments had shaken them off of one trail and onto the trails of
several other warriors around the world. On top of that, a faction of 
the Fu-Ma ninja grew tired of Toki&#39;s actions and planned to overthrow 
him in a coup.

Both factions, regardless of their reasons, collect the pieces of the
tainted blade... killing any who refuse to willingly give them away.

Chapter 4- Tainted Shadows
________________________________________________________________________

It had been a week-long march from Osaka to nearby Kyoto. Though it was
no longer the &quot;capital of peace&quot;, there was still something about it 
that was distinguished, in a way. In any event, the weather was stifling.
Summer had not ended just yet- it was only July, and quite early into
it.

&quot;Gods, but it&#39;s hot out here! It&#39;s just about evening and I&#39;m still
burning up!&quot; Mi-na did not sound too unhappy about it. To her, the heat
was a mild discomfort, thanks to the Scarlet Thunder. However, her
sentiments were echoed by her other three companions. They needed to
do something about this weather before they all passed out. Xianghua
was a bit jealous of her friend for being able to survive this fire-
storm, but Talim simply accepted it. Anything that was a part of
nature, she always accepted. Closing her eyes and smiling to herself,
she approached the undaunted Seong prodigy with a smile on her face.

&quot;Maybe we need to find an inn or something soon... Xianghua and Kilik
look like they&#39;re about to pass out.&quot; Mi-na nodded as she considered.
She didn&#39;t have to look behind her to feel Xianghua&#39;s stressed state,
and knew perfectly well that Talim could sense whether their mutual
friend was injured or under stress.

&quot;Maybe... I&#39;d think about it, if we weren&#39;t being tailed.&quot;

Talim thought for a moment... then she nodded. &quot;Yes... we have been
followed for the past few days, haven&#39;t we? I&#39;ve noticed signs of
someone pursuing us. The wind has the echoes of footsteps everywhere...
but some of them are much closer, and are much more in time with ours.&quot;

Mi-na nodded. &quot;We&#39;re going to have to be careful tonight. We&#39;ll head to
an inn and get some sleep in the meantime.&quot; Both Xianghua and Kilik
said in tandem, &quot;Thank you! You read my mind!&quot; Then they looked at
each other and laughed. Mi-na shook her head and smiled warmly.
If this went well, she would be able to handle the situation
fairly well and not have to get the others involved...

She concealed her thoughts from her friends and began planning for
the evening as they headed towards a nearby rest stop as the sun set.
________________________________________________________________________

Ten unknown individuals, some of them women, converged and communed
silently in a nearby alleyway.

&quot;Dammit! They&#39;ve been on to us the whole time,&quot; one of them exclaimed.
&quot;Maybe we should just go through with it while we still have the chance-
end this quickly!&quot; Another one spoke up in agreement. &quot;He&#39;s right...
we&#39;ve been found out without us even noticing. They don&#39;t know who
we are or whether we&#39;re armed or not, but they know we&#39;re here. Let&#39;s
do it now, while they&#39;re still-&quot;

One of them held up her hand, and the individual went silent. This
one was the lead, apparently. &quot;No. We will go with our original plan
and attack by nightfall. Their sleep will make their reactions sluggish,
perhaps enough so that we may injure and not kill. We may yet be able
to do this without completely dishonoring our clan. These individuals
do not deserve death simply because they carry the fragments.&quot;

They nodded collectively. She continued with a grave nod. &quot;However,
if the situation becomes complicated... and if we are forced... we
will take appropriate measures.&quot; They all nodded again, and checked
their weapons. For the moment, the various whips, blades, chains,
kunai and shuriken were concealed neatly in their clothing, waiting for
the proper time of use. They would no longer conceal their armaments
once the time came- rather, they would be in full force.

Some of them would stick to the shadows, throwing their impliments
while the targets were distracted. That is, if they didn&#39;t kill
them in their sleep or steal the fragments from under their noses.
Either way would work, one was more efficient. Neither was honorable,
but they had sacrificed honor for loyalty, as well as destroying evil.
At least, that was what it used to be. Now, Toki had more power
than they could ever imagine from his lust for the shards and the
demonds.

His word was still absolute for them. And the shards they carried
did not lie- the travelers carried four pieces of the Soul Edge
with them. They had their orders- convince, steal, or kill in order
to obtain the shards of the demonic weapon. With the way they
handled their blades, convincing would not work. With the way the
one wearing her emerald green, infiltration and thievery would
be difficult, but still possible, as long as they did it in a
certain order.

The girl in red, with brown hair and the zanbato would be first.
Then the man with the staff- he had no shards, so he would have to die. 
Their range would be difficult to overcome in a fight, and would have 
to be dealt with first in case something went wrong. After that, it
would be simple enough to subdue the other two.

 
The plan was quickly set in motion as the sun set, each parting their
own way. Within seconds, the alley was clear as if there were no one
there in the first place. Minutes later, night had fallen... and the
stage was set.
________________________________________________________________________

The inn was still.

It was just about midnight, and the moon was high and full. Summer was
in its full swing, and as usual, it was slightly cooler at night. Mi-na
was, not surprisingly, asleep. Though the heat had not affected her, the
journey had. Talim and Xianghua were not in their own rooms, but in
the same one as she was, snuggled up to her. As a sort of strategy, they
had decided to stay in the same room as a sort of precaution.

However, Mi-na&#39;s trained mind and senses could feel the sudden 
malevolence in the air. Their guests had arrived as expected. She opened
her eyes and looked at the other two with a fond expression. They did
not need to participate in this- she would rather not see them carry
any sort of burden. Nor would she tolerate Kilik getting himself
involved, unless he needed to. He might have been one of the destined
bearers, but he had doubts about himself; self-loathing. Doubt led to 
indecision, which led to defeat.

She could not afford defeat. Not here.

Waking up and sliding out of the embrace, with only a slight discomfort
from Xianghua before she settled down again, she made sure that her two
friends were soundly tucked in before she made her way silently towards
the outer courtyard. Moving smoothly and slowly, she stepped wtih her
heel first, rolling to the ball of her foot. This movement was done
with such grace that it seemed that she was walking in slow motion,
and without a sound.

And she felt eyes... watching. Waiting. Appearing to do simple
observation of her movements from some unknown, far off shadow. She
chuckled to herself as she walked to the center of the inner courtyard
before holding her weapon as one holds a walking stick, the butt of
the weapon against the ground and the blade in the air, shimmering as
the moonlight hit it.

&quot;Can&#39;t you guys be a bit less obvious? I mean, you&#39;re supposed to be
the best.&quot; Mi-na&#39;s voice was brimming with confidence, yet her stance
showed a wary disposition. Though she had sensed them, it was a slight
thing. These ninja, whoever they were, were good. She did not make
the mistake of underestimating them. They would not be roused by
a mere declaration of them being discovered... so she would try 
a psychological trick.

There had to be a few of them who were brash- highly trained, yet
young and eager to prove themselves. They had a hot temper on a short
fuse, and one that had a lot of flash and sound, but little to no
effect. She would target those first. &quot;This is a complete waste of
my time, being out here. If you have no business with me other than
sneaking around, then go back to where you came from, before you get-&quot;

A whizzing sound was heard as something was thrown. Two flashes of light
shone out of the corner of her eye as the shuriken came flying towards
her. She made a slight movement to her zhanmadao, shifting the blade in
order to block the incoming projectiles. It was done at the last second,
seeing as they may have been audible, but the fact that they were denoted
that the speed at which they were thrown was immense.

But she was faster. She finished her sentence as the two clangs sounded
from the sharp weapons hitting her defense. &quot;-hurt. So then, come on
out and play, or run along and go back to whatever hidey hole you came
from.&quot; With that, she waited. That had to frustrate someone- the attack
would not have come if she hadn&#39;t done her job.

Moments later, she heard it. &quot;Damn you!&quot;

A young man, barely seventeen years old, appeared to her left side. He 
had a few more of the shuriken in a bag at his right hip. The hand that 
was near it shook violently and with frustration. &quot;I&#39;d wipe that smug 
look from your face... if you didn&#39;t have something important to us.&quot; He 
held out his hand, taking a wide stance as he did so.

&quot;Give us the pieces of the sword! We&#39;ll let you and your people live, and
you&#39;ll never hear from us again. if you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll just have to snatch
them from you by force. And trust me, doing that would be a pleasure
right now.&quot; Mi-na almost laughed. He was the one she was looking for,
all right. &quot;Is that so? Are you talking about these, then?&quot;

She reached into a pouch that she had carried with her as she made her 
way out to the staging area. As she withdrew her hand... the four pieces 
of the sword shone a deep crimson in response to her touch. Her soul...
they wanted it... but if they wanted it, they had to cut her, not just
touch her. She heard the faint whisperings in her head, the promises of
power...

And put them back again as she caught the young ninja eyeing them
greedily. He had heard the voices as well. She had a strong enough will
to ignore the temptations- he did not. She looked at him sternly.

&quot;You want these? You&#39;ll have to take them by force. You have no idea
what they can do to you- where they&#39;ll lead you. Just head back home...
and forget you ever saw them.&quot; The young ninja almost growled as if
he already had the shards, and someone were threatening to take
them from him. &quot;Then pay with your life!&quot; He rushed forward, drawing
the four foot long katana from his back as he advanced...

And was stopped cold by her right heel slamming into his midsection
as she executed a front kick with blinding speed. Her polearm was still
held at neutral stance, a scowl on her face. &quot;See? You&#39;re getting
impatient.&quot; He didn&#39;t hear, seeing as he was busy flying back for
about six feet before rolling on the ground. As he regained himself 
however, he threw three more of the sharp stars before rushing again, 
leaping into the air as he reached the halfway point before throwing
three more shuriken at her.

Mi-na scoffed as she defended herself against the projectiles by
quicky twirling her weapon before her, all six stopped cold by her
weapon. She wasn&#39;t even getting serious yet... He came down on her
with his blade extended, just as the throws were finished, only to
meet her own blade as he did so and bouncing off of it, stumbling
backwards slightly.

&quot;Tch... fine! No more playing!&quot; He began charging forward again,
his body blurring as he began moving at a frantic pace. He may as
well have been moving in slow motion... Quickly shifting her weapon
to the 35&quot; long dao, she began fending off his attacks with fluent
motion, never using the blade to block.

And I mean never. Every strike was dodged, and the ones that were
not dodged were interrupted. His frustration and lust for the blade
clouded his mind... and within the first minute of the fight, his
body bore four fresh, bleeding scars.

Thus, the first three moves, which were three horizontal strokes
to Mi-na&#39;s head, did not follow through past the first one. Mi-na
twisted low, settling into a lotus stance while cutting to her
left with the broadword. A thin line of blood was etched into
his stomach, and he stumbled to his right side as the blade
dragged him around.

With his stance broken, Mi-na did not hesitate to quickly rise
upwards, her left leg curling into a vicious hook kick as she
turned her back. The young ninja was sent upwards and backwards
with the attack, sprawling to the ground as he had the wind knocked
out of him yet again.

&quot;You&#39;re a joke.&quot; She heard the whip lancing towards her and raised her
left hand in order to let it wrap around her forearm. Mi-na then twisted
her arm again, securing the whip before tugging hard, forcing a woman
from the shadows! &quot;And you! Quit hiding and fight!&quot; The young man
had regained himself during the distraction and rushed towards her
again, this time thrusting instead of shashing.

Mi-na deftly parried the strike while turning to her left side, and
rammed the back end of the dao into the right side of his jaw, sending
the agressor reeling backwards. Meanwhile, the other assailant regained
her footing and attempted to drag the Seong prodigy towards her with
a violent tug.

...Which she let happen. Mi-na grinned as she used the momentum of the
pull to increase her speed, charging towards the woman and jumping
into the air, attacking with a flying side kick! Surprised at her
sudden advance, the opponent could only raise her forearm as the knife
edge of Mi-na&#39;s left boot rammed into its target. The attack
was blocked, but the sheer force alone caused the ninja to stumble
backwards...

Which gave her all the time she needed to ram into her opponent&#39;s
forehead with the back end of the dao! This time, the ninja was sent
to the floor quite hard, holding her head in pain as her ears rang
with the impact of the blow. And yet they continued coming! The
young man that had been utterly rejected was back on his feet again
and continued his reckless advance, though his speed seemed to pick
up with every time he was knocked down.

&quot;You&#39;re kinda annoying,&quot; Mi-na said as she heard him advance. She also
heard something being lit... her eyes widened slightly as she considered
the implications of what was about to happen. A flash bomb, or perhaps
a live one? It didn&#39;t matter; the noise alone would wake her companions,
thus forcing them to fight!

Not good.

She allowed the attacker to rush towards her headlong as he swung his
blade downwards in a horizontal stroke, moving from his right to
his left in an almost untracable blur. Mi-na deflected the attack,
leaned into him with her shoulder, and grabbed the wrist of
his weapon arm while wrapping her other arm around a leg.

With that, she tossed him over her head, leaning towards the direction
of the noise she had heard quite quickly in the hope that she would stop
the explosive from being hefted.

She did, but only barely.

WHAM

The young man smashed into one of the ninja in the shadows,
knocking them both unconcious. Two down... how many to go? How many more
until this was over with? Apparently, many more. A man with a huge 
shuriken came forth, sighing as he did so. &quot;Idiot... he doesn&#39;t know
when to learn, does he?&quot; he twirled the massive weapon around his first
two fingers, running full tilt at Mi-na as he did so. &quot;Ah, well...
let&#39;s see what you can do about this!&quot;

As he approached, he slammed his palm into the ground, kicking up quite
a large amount of dust. There, he stopped. Undaunted, Mi-na watched
closely, listening for any signs of an incoming attack. The property 
damage alone with this weapon could be bad... she had to keep him from 
using it! Unfortunately as she began running forward, seeing as it would 
be the only logical course of action at this point despite the risks, the 
woman with the whip stopped her.

The nine-section whip wrapped around Mi-na&#39;s neck, gagging her slightly.
She had not heard her coming... As the woman&#39;s arms wrapped around the
Seong prodigy&#39;s neck, she purred seductively into her ear. &quot;You know...
you fight well for someone your age. If you had been on our side, things
would be different. Shame that it&#39;ll end here.&quot;

Indeed, while she was speaking, Mi-na could hear the increasing noise
of the giant shuriken as it increased in revolution speed, thus increasing
in force. She had to get out of this hold before...

...But she couldn&#39;t. Something pinned her to the floor. What was that-
it looked like a tanto was imbedded into the ground, in the exact
location of her shadow from the moon! This was not good... &quot;Sorry girlie,&quot;
said a tall, thin man behind her. He was quite well built and healthy,
but still looked like he needed a bit of sun. 

Along with another tanto that was sheathed at his left hip, he was armed 
with quite a few kunai. One of them was MUCH larger than the rest, with 
a chain and a counter weight attatched to the end. He was busy whirling 
the weighted end with expertise. &quot;You can&#39;t run from your own shadow... 
and I&#39;ll make it so that statement sticks. Literally.&quot;

She had to do something- anything- but the moon would not be covered
with clouds anytime soon. The whirling increased until it was almost
deafening... She couldn&#39;t hear much of anythign else as the weapon was
prepared to be thrown with decapatating force. The woman with the whip
purred into Mi-na&#39;s ear again.

&quot;Surrounded... outnumbered... and yet you fought on. I commend you.
Therefore, I&#39;ll make this one last offer. This can all stop when you
give us the pieces of the sword in your possesion. I can make these
people go away, and you won&#39;t have to see us again. Ever. You can
be about your way.

Just do it... I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t want to die, right?&quot;

Mi-na grimaced as she thought of the people in Jirisan... those
who had suffered at the hands of this catastrophe called the
Evil Seed. Its corruption was still evident everywhere she went-
during her travels through China, she had battled against an entire
army of Japanese pirates who lusted for battle. Wanting to turn
the world into their own playground, they wanted the Soul Edge-
not to mention her own power on their side.

So they had effectively kidnapped Talim and injured Xianghua,
leaving her just about helpless to do anything about the situation.
She felt miserable. And angry. Talim&#39;s cries for help echoed through 
her mind as she approached the compound, fury and divine retribution
on her mind. She made a personal raid through the enemy camp, tearing
the opposing forces asunder wtih little more than waves of her
hand. Fire and heat and passionate anger swept the forces aside
in one night, and in the end...

The entire complex exploded in both sound and fury, the image
of a phoenix forming in the air from the ambient heat and fire
as Mi-na&#39;s command of the Flames of Passion spiraled out of
her control. Talim was saved, Xianghua was healed... but Mi-na&#39;s
battle rage had decimated the surrounding warehouses and docks.

She remembered... recalled what she had to do to end the ambitions
of an entire force. This was not a force... this was a strike team.
She would not resort to slaying them all with such uncontrollable
rage. Still, she remembered that Talim and Xianghua were still in
the building... if she died and they got their hands on the
fragments, along with the ones that she knew they had on them,
they would probably kill the others as well after being seduced
by the shards of tainted metal.

No.

Hell no.

&quot;I won&#39;t give the shards up... I won&#39;t quit... and I won&#39;t die!
But most of all...&quot; She tensed her body and gripped the handle
of the broadsword tightly, making the steel heat up with a crimson
glow. With that, the personal space around her increased in 
temperature sharply, burning the woman behind her. But still,
she would not let go. Indeed, her grip tightened. However,
it wasn&#39;t over. Mi-na grabbed one of the woman&#39;s arms by the wrist, 
her left hand forming a claw as she clamped down hard.

Now then, this was a special manuver... because the grip targeted
two pressure points. Mi-na&#39;s thumb was digging into a depression
just at the base of the palm while her pinky finger was pressed
into a spot on her opponent&#39;s radial bone, in line with the
thumb. Now, a technique like this would take exceptional strength
of one&#39;s muscles... and Mi-na had been training since the age of
ten.

But then again, there was something else. The grasp burned through
skin and flesh. There was just no defense for it as her fingers
dug in sharply, hitting the nerves at their source. Oh, her opponent
let go... but not before Mi-na could slam the back of her dao into
the ribs. There was a point there too- one that made her opponent
reel in pain from three different areas. Her arm was numb. Her
chest and stomach were singing with pain. She loosened her grip even
further, and the move continued. Throwing the assailant sharply
over her left hip and putting her body behind the toss, she threw
her weight behind the overthrow and shouted, &quot;I WON&#39;T LOSE!&quot;

The woman went flying, crashing into the man within the dust cloud 
and sending his weapon off to one side, heading for one of the 
supports. What happened in the next few moments would defy
explination, as Mi-na burst from her position in a blaze of speed,
the air pressure around her thinning as she moved at a speed far
beyond her limits. The thin man atop the roof gaped as the woman
took off, breaking the hold that his Soul Dagger had on her with
nothing but sheer will.

&quot;What the hell is this!? She has spiritual powers, too?&quot;

But he would have no time to awnser as Mi-na planted one foot on
the wooden vertical beam that the weapon was headed for, launching
herself off of it in a spectacular bound. Both hands pressed forward,
the tip of the dao pointing towards the ground and the edge outwards.
As she made contact with the weapon, a sharp rake of metal bending and
twisting can be heard before the weapon falls to the ground.

In two pieces. She had cut through steel!

&quot;Shit,&quot; the man atop the roofs whispered. &quot;She&#39;s turned into a demon...
No, worse than a demon, for I can&#39;t feel anything posessing her. This
may have been a bad idea... this isn&#39;t possesion. This is battle rage!&quot;

Mi-na looked up towards the man on the rooftops, her brown eyes now 
glowing a lighter color; a fierce hazel. She had not completely shifted,
but was just about ready to with any more pressure. As if sensing this,
a woman called out.

&quot;Enough! Stand down, all of you.&quot;

Mi-na scoffed, her fighting spirit still showing. &quot;What, you guys 
can&#39;t handle the heat anymore? You started it.. come and finish!&quot;

The other five figures appeared from the shadows while the thin man
leapt down from the roof. She smirked and shifted her weapon back
into the zhanmadao form, grinning widely as she did so. (Just like
I thought,) she mused to herself. (Ten of them, and well-armed.
Probably sent to take us out and take the shards. Four down,
six standing. Piece of cake.)

She continued staring towards the group, her eyes filled with
contempt. &quot;See, this is why I don&#39;t like having trouble follow me.
I so want to give these shards to you, but y&#39;see that in anyone
else&#39;s hands, they&#39;d cause madness. I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m worthy 
of bearing these damn things- I don&#39;t even hold it as an honor.
But I certainly do have the dicipline to move forward, despite
what any little piece of crap sword tells me.

Anyways... I&#39;m not giving them to someone I can&#39;t trust, and right
now you guys are on the bottom of the list. So I&#39;m gonna ask once
before I send you packing. Who are you, why are you after the shards,
and why do you have a few dozen of &#39;em yourselves?&quot;

She stood with her weapon upright in a neutral stance, ready for
any attack that came her way. However, none did. It seemed as if
the two teams were sizing each other up. She may have been one
woman, but Seong Mi-na could take out an entire army with her
skills and the power of the Scarlet Thunder.

It was all a matter of who moved first. But the woman who had spoken
shook her head softly. &quot;Those four fought well... two of them did not
even have the chance to move, however. You anticipated our movments
before they could even be carried out properly. Impressive. What 
name does such a skilled individual have?&quot;

Mi-na held her head up high, her eyes shining with defiance. Still,
she gave her name. &quot;Seong Mi-na. And yeah, you guys do have a style
I&#39;ve seen before, though some of you are most definitely new to me.
I fought one of you before, I think. But I have to confirm- do
any of you know of a woman named Taki?&quot;

The six that were still standing all nodded. &quot;Ah yes, the rouge.
So you fought with her many times before, have you?&quot; Mi-na nodded.
&quot;She had more honor about her than half of you guys put together.
She fought me straight instead of sneaking about and throwing crap
at me. But whatever- I can fight on any level, with anyone. I
think I&#39;ve proven that well enough, don&#39;t you?

Now then, tell me about the shards you have. And make it fast-
I don&#39;t have much patience right now.&quot;
________________________________________________________________________

A still night had fallen over the capital of Kyoto as a meeting was 
held among the captains of the Fu-Ma no Sato. In an undisclosed location,
they were busy discussing the nukenin, Taki, and how best to execute her. 
A handful had already been chosen as oinin, but had been thwarted almost 
instantaneously. Even as they sent their best, the attempts on Taki&#39;s 
life were thwarted time after time. They were running low on those who 
would take the task.

&quot;This is absurd... we would be better off searching for the Soul
Edge than simply going after a rouge ninja who won&#39;t give in. She
is just too powerful, and has an unnatural command of Mekki-maru. Not
to mention that her abilities have exceeded our own in strength.&quot;

Another captain spoke up. &quot;Indeed. We already have a few, and those that
we have collected were given to us instead of us having to kill for them.
But that was just luck- we need more resources in order to get them
from those who would not be encouraged so easily.&quot;

Encouraged meaning able to be stolen from. They all nodded in agreement
as the one who spoke turned to master Toki, head of the clan. &quot;Do you
have any input, sir? Or perhaps, is your mind already set?&quot;

The clan leader remained silent for quite a while. The other members
fell silent, one by one, until all attention was focused on him. He
muttered something, almost incoherently. &quot;Mekki-maru...&quot; Some of
them tilted their heads at this utterance- others simply listened.

&quot;Mekki-maru... find it. Find the shards as well. Bring them all to me-
every last one. I am quite close to obtaining what I desire. Failure
will not suffice on this mission. Please, do as I request.&quot; They
all stood and saluted, parting ways after doing so. A twisted grin
came from Toki&#39;s usually serene face as the implications of
destruction entered his mind.

&quot;Yes... come to me, my child. We will finish this once and for all.&quot;

Meanwhile... 

A ninja clad in a dark blue body suit and gleaming armor
stood in a forest that was quite some distance from the main temple.
She was quite wary as she faced yet another council- or at least,
a few members of it. Her demon mask gave away nothing as she began
speaking.

&quot;I have the information that you are looking for... but I warn you
that these shards are not for the faint of heart or for the weak
of mind. They are tainted; evil and puissant. I don&#39;t need to say
this, but I figured you should know.

Also... you don&#39;t have the capability to defeat Toki. Not yet.
I will deal with him myself. I must- I cannot leave him in such a
state, if what you&#39;ve told me is true.&quot;

They nodded and stayed silent, fearing that their replies might
be heard by someone passing by. Even the woman was quiet, her
voice a low whisper, barely audible. &quot;Then I will explain. I have
thrown my trails off by leaking information about the shards- or
at least, the locations that I know. I know of at least three or
four others, but they will not be so easy to obtain.

One of them should be in China by now, if my information serves
me well. Around four more are headed towards the mainland, perhaps
in some sort of entourage. Many others are perhaps here in Japan,
but I&#39;m not too certain where. There&#39;s one in India, in the posession
of a pirate from Ryukyu.

Many of them are in the West, though the situation there has become
highly unstable. I would not travel there if I were you all, but
it is where one of the highest concentrations of the sword emanate
from. Everything else is dust in the wind for now.&quot;

They nodded again, and one of them spoke in the same low whisper.
&quot;We&#39;ll confirm your information much later, but I&#39;ll put my trust
in you for now. Toki is located in the shrine, just beneath 
our headquarters. I suggest you be careful around him... these
days he grows erratic and unsound of mind. He acts as if he knows
not his own strength, and has killed many of our most elite in
his anger.&quot;

The woman had a grave expression on her face. Oh yes, this had
to end.

&quot;Understood. Don&#39;t worry- I&#39;ll take care of it. I always do.&quot;
________________________________________________________________________

Mi-na&#39;s eyes were back to their chestnut brown again as she nodded
thoughtfully. An entire treasure trove of these shards were right
underneath the mountains, and all they had to do was head over there
to purify them. Of course, the shards they still had were tainted
and unbalanced, longing to be with their companions.

And they almost sang for joy now, resonating with the other fragments
in the possesion of the ninja. She realized that they had no way right
now of purifying such concentrated evil energy. The aura from just one
little shard was massive, and it seemed that corruption spread from
it even as they carried them around.

The ninja that remained standing here must have had wills of steel,
tempered and forged in some way that Mi-na could not understand fully.
Nevertheless, she recognized it for what it was and nodded towards them
as if her resolve had been hardened.

&quot;I&#39;ll take those shards from you guys, if you don&#39;t mind. I know
which side you&#39;re working for- you wouldn&#39;t have talked to me like
this if you were working for Toki&#39;s side. But seriously- let us carry
them for you. I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t need such things when this is over,
right?&quot;

The six of them considered for a moment. Of course, she was right.
And she had already proven herself in battle- any further combat was
useless. At this rate, she would defeat them, regardless of what
range they fought at. Her battle rage, along with her unique weapon,
gave her every advantage she needed to fight on par with any opponent.

Still... the leader did sense something dangerous within that weapon.
She took the time to address Mi-na about it now.

&quot;Be wary of that blade you carry. It requires an iron control of
one&#39;s emotions- in fact their very soul. If you can&#39;t control yourself,
it will control you. Just like these shards that we give you now. But
just by the look on your face,&quot; she added solemnly, &quot;You know plenty
about that. Perhaps it has already happened. If that is the case, then
turn back from your path and forget the weapon you hold.&quot;

The Seong prodigy shook her head. Her resolve was as firm as ever.

&quot;Thanks... but I think I&#39;ll stick with it. My zhanmadao has never
let me down before, and I will master it as I have before. If it takes
mastering myself, then so be it. I&#39;ll be stronger for it. Besides,
I don&#39;t want to have anything that&#39;s happened before... repeat itself
because I couldn&#39;t do everything that I was capable of.

You understand, right?&quot;

Mi-na stretched out her limbs, arching her back and closing her eyes
as she did so. &quot;Well anyways, I certainly wish you guys the best of-&quot;
But when she opened her eyes again, they were gone. A neat pile of
ten shards of Soul Edge lay before her feet, shining their tainted
crimson aura. It was not yet enough to create another evil blade,
but they certainly looked happy to see each other.

Along with them was a note, quickly scribed on paper. It said only two
words- stay true. She smiled as she finished her sentence. &quot;...luck.
Yeah, but you won&#39;t need it, will you?&quot; She gathered the shards and
placed them in the pouch, took the note and burned it in one of the
torches, and shuffled her way back to bed.

She was tired through the entire fight.

Which meant that throughout the entire battle, her reflexes were 
indeed slower... had she moved any faster and been in top form, the
match would have been far less difficult, with far fewer hits taken
on her account. How far could she go? How much longer until she had
surpassed even these limits?

She had no idea. Nor did she care. She only cared about going back
to sleep.

However, there were some that did not sleep...

A bird. One with black feathers and red eyes. It had heard, seen,
smelled everything. As Mi-na yawned and moved from sight, the avian
flew off again. This would be remembered for a while now by the bird
with jet-black wings...

And once it reached its master, it would have quite a tale to tell.

To be continued...

Holy crap.

I&#39;m serious. That was spectacular. I pulled that fight scene out of
my ass there- I had no idea it would go in that direction. In any event,
I was definitely heading to bed when I wrote that part before the
final scene- all of that was a flashback of the events that happened
prior to the raid at the inn.

Oh, and Mi-na had sucessfully warded off the opponents without waking
up Xianghua or Talim. Ladies and gentlemen, let&#39;s hear it for the
Heart and Soul Girl! Rock on!

Laters, guys. Remember, feedback good, flames bad.</pre>
