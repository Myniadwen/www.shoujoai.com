<h1>Unexpected (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/asanuma.html">Asanuma Toshiro</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../soulcal/unexpect-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Author&#39;s note : This is Chapter 2 of my Soul Calibur fanfic, 
&quot;Unexpected&quot;. Sophitia is tickled with little feelings that she thought 
she would never have. Enjoy.


The hot water stings the injury on my hip, although the wound is almost 
healed. I keep thinking back to the battle with Nightmare. I wonder how 
Seung Minda manages to defeat Nightmare. He&#39;s such a strong fighter and 
any blow from that Soul Edge can finish anyone. I know she&#39;s strong as 
well, but I don&#39;t think one blow could have done it for him. When I 
awoke I saw some cuts and bruises on her perfect skin. She must have had 
more work to do on him. Nevertheless, I am grateful.
 
As I finish washing my golden blonde hair, my thoughts begin to linger 
on about her. I sneak a look past her open back doors, only to gaze at 
how swiftly and gracefully she moves about her house, setting the table, 
watching how the eggs fry, the way her is put up.. I can&#39;t help but feel 
my wetness invading the space between my legs. 

&#39;Oh God, what am I thinking?&#39;, I quickly shake off the trance and 
continue to wash my hair but now I have to cleanse that spot between my 
legs again.
 
&#39;What&#39;s wrong with me?&#39;, I ask myself as I clense that sacred spot once 
again. It&#39;s only been an hour but already I&#39;m feeling...different.. I 
don&#39;t know how or what but I can&#39;t stop looking at her and marveling at 
her divine beauty. Why didn&#39;t I notice this before? I ask myself no more 
as I finish up my bath and grab a towel.

&quot;Hey, breakfast is almost ready!&quot;, Mina tells me as I walk in with my 
towel on.

&quot;Um.. where are my clothes?&quot;, I ask her, looking around.

&quot;They were washed and are hanging up in the back because they were 
filled with blood and sweat.&quot;, Mina points to where I just came from.

I feel so stupid that I didn&#39;t notice them. I go over and touch them but 
they&#39;re wet. Was this set up by Mina? No, she wouldn&#39;t. She was just 
being nice.

&quot;Um.. what will I wear?&quot;, I ask her.

&quot;Oh, you can wear one of my things. It&#39;s hanging up in the room I set up 
for you.&quot;, she points to the opposite of my direction, into a big room 
with lots of blankets and different types of clothes... and a King size 
canopy bed. This must be her room. I go to the garment that is hanging 
up. I take it down and look at it. It is a quite large gown, pink on the 
long sleeves with a red cufflink and from the collar stopping at the top 
of the ribs, with the rest being blue down to the bottom. It also has a 
red tie for the chest and the gown is designed with things that I do not 
know of.
 
&quot;You&#39;re bigger than me so you won&#39;t fit into my clothes so I had that 
saved just in case.&quot;, she tells me, &quot;What do you think?&quot;, she asks.

I stop staring at it for a minute to answer her.

&quot;It&#39;s beautiful..&quot;, I say.

&quot;It&#39;s made of silk too. I want you to keep it.&quot;, she smiles at me.

I touch the smooth silk of the gown and marvel at the beauty of it all.

&quot;Thank you, Mina.&quot;, I say to her.

&quot;No problem, Sophie. Just think of it as a thank you for everything else 
you have done for me.&quot;, she smiles again, &quot;Well let me go serve 
breakfast, will you be ok in here? Do you know how to put it on?&quot;, she 
asks in concern.

Embarassed at the thought of her helping me change, I abrubtly reply, 
&quot;Thanks, I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

And with that she goes back to kitchen, leaving me in her beautiful 
room.

The gown is just so beautiful, I don&#39;t want to damage it. It&#39;s the only 
thing to wear so I guess it&#39;ll have to do. I pull it on, letting the 
sleeves slide down my arms, and pushing the bottom down to my feet. I 
tie the sash around the collar and let out a deep breath. The silk is so 
cool on my skin, it relaxes me. It also smells of wildflower, Mina&#39;s 
infamous scent in which I marvel at. I walk out into the kitchen and I 
see Mina putting the last of the utensils on the table, when her jaw 
drops when she sees me.

&quot;Oh my, you look so beautiful in that.&quot;, she says, &quot;I know how to make 
it look better.&quot; She comes closer to me, adjusting the sash so it is 
aligned with the middle of my neck, going past my breasts. She looks at 
me with a suggestive smile as she adjusts the sash and &quot;accidentally&quot;, 
her left hand brushes on my right breast as it adjusts the knot. I blush 
lightly.

&quot;There now you look so much better!&quot;, she giggles with excitement, &quot;Oh 
but wait, let me fix the collar in the back..&quot;, she says. She turns me 
around and does something, I don&#39;t know what with the collar, for I am 
too nervous with her breathing on my neck, her nose softly brushing on 
my neck as she finishes what she was doing. Good thing the gown is 
baggy, otherwise my erect nipples would have caught anyone&#39;s eye.

&quot;Now you look perfect!&quot;, she sighs in happiness, &quot;Now come on, let&#39;s 
eat.&quot;, she leads me to a chair and I sit down on it.

Breakfast was great, as we ate silently. I finish first and go to wash 
my plate as she comes behind me, putting her plate in the sink as well 
but she does it in a way where her hands brush on my stomach, leaving  
me in suspense of what she is thinking. She gives me a playful smile as 
she goes to her room.

I take a seat down in her living room when I hear her call to me. I go 
to her room and she pulls out my Orichalcum. It&#39;s in mint condition. How 
the hell? I thought it was chipped and beaten by Nightmare.

She knows my look of confusion, &quot;It seems that it repaired itself. I 
don&#39;t even know how.&quot;, she says with a puzzled look.

I can think of nothing but to hug her tightly for retrieving my weapon, 
or is it something else? I do not know..

&quot;Thank you, Mina..&quot;, I say and in a split second, I wrap my arms around 
her waist, showing my gratitude.

&quot;No problem, Sophie.&quot;, she smiles and wraps her arms around my neck.

We stay there for a while and I don&#39;t want to let go. I feel butterflies 
in my stomach, yet I don&#39;t know why. I just don&#39;t want to let go. Before 
I know it, we&#39;re sitting on her beautiful pink canopy bed, in each 
other&#39;s arms.

&quot;Mina, please don&#39;t let go..&quot;, I say to her inbetween tears..

She replies, struggling with her own tears..

&quot;I never intended to..&quot;


Author&#39;s note(cont) : Well? Did you like it? Please R&amp;R. I would GREATLY 
appreciate it. I enjoyed writing this chapter and I hope you guys 
enjoyed reading it. Chapter 3 should have the lemon, if the plot goes
