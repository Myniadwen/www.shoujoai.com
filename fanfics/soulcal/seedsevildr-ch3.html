~Excerpt from a page of the travel diary of Seong Mi-na

Chapter 3- Iron Maiden in Silk

________________________________________________________________________

Searching for leads was harder than Mi-na thought.

There was news abound about the conflict between Japan and Korea, but
nothing about anything interesting. She knew that was happening; she
needed to know about anything else that was going on. Anyone who was
said to be of exceptional skill, besides Yi Sun-sin, the admiral.
No doubt, he was a genius at strategy- and he was smart enough to
know perfectly well that she was here.

If she started moving now, it would be ill-advised.

Instead, she looked for other clues- other situations of note. Of course,
when asked why she wanted to know, she told them she was simply looking
for something interesting to do. She had the feeling that no one would
believe her if she told them her mission. Besides, those that did
believe would begin blabbing their mouths, spreading the word to those
that did not entirely... want to do good with such information.

Thus, she had found out that Toyotomi Hideyoshi had a castle here in
Osaka... storming the place was out of the question, though it was most
definitely in her mind at the time. If someone sacked the place, this
war would take a major shift in tides. However, she most decidedly
did not want to bother with such things, seeing as she knew that the
castle was virtually impenetrable at the moment.

Over the next few days however, she noticed that armies from the castle 
were starting to get a move on. Watching from the inn that she and her
companions had been staying at, she noticed that many of them had the
resolved looks on their faces of men who would not be coming back home.
But she didn&#39;t entirely care for the power-hungry nation, who had
strove to dominate her homeland.

Not to mention that there was little she could do about such a large
force.

Thus, she stayed perfectly still, not making a move against them.

&quot;Tragic, is it not?&quot;

Mi-na turned around suddenly, Talim and Xianghua quickly following
suit. She had come along so quietly behind them that no one had heard
them coming. Had she attacked, Mi-Na and Talim would not have heard
or felt the attack until the last second. Something about her demeanor
told of one who practiced the sword... yet she carried no weapons
on her.

Still, that was no reason to underestimate her.

As they all calmed down, she continued speaking. Her skin was almost
the complexion of snow- unclouded and almost a pure white, with her 
black hair tied above her head. Her oil paper parasol was open
and lazily hanging above her, blocking the sunlight from reaching
her.

&quot;They continually fight on, knowing that their lives are at stake. The
forces they face will eventually overcome them- the most they can hope
to do is hold their own ground. Perhaps they should just die- all
life ends sooner or later, whether it be for a just cause or not.&quot;

She sounded quite ambivalent about it all, a mixture of sadness and
anger in her voice. Still, her face bore no expression. Realizing that
she was not entirely out to kill them, Mi-Na casually asked, &quot;You seem
like you know quite a bit about the subject. Care to shed some light?&quot;

The woman shook her head. &quot;No... At least, not yet. I still have many
things to resolve before my tale can be told. In any event, since we
have spoken thus far, what are your names?&quot;

They all awnsered, one at a time. Kilik had just come forth from his
room after hearing conversation out front, and spoke his name as well.
Mi-na had heard him, at least- he was not the kind of man who would
train himself to be completely quiet. But the woman next
to her was as silent as death, as if she had trained her steps to
be like air.

&quot;Setsuka. It is... interesting to make your aquaintance, at the
least.&quot; She bowed slightly- at least she had the grace to perform
such a gesture. &quot;In any event... you bear weapons, I see. I&#39;m 
wondering if you have heard or seen a man known as Mitsurugi.&quot;

Her voice carried no weight this time, just a question.

Mi-na took some time to think. She figured this little piece of 
information would not be of any trouble, so she spoke. &quot;Yeah- I 
fought with him a few times. He&#39;s a decent opponent, if not 
somewhat insecure. Why do you ask?&quot;

Setsuka nods her head. &quot;I&#39;m wondering where I can find him. He
and I have some... matters to discuss.&quot; The four of them looked at
each other in puzzlement. Mi-na was the only one who understood,
after a while. She nodded and spoke again. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know
where he is exactly, but the last place I saw him was in China.
Though I&#39;m not that sure that he&#39;s there anymore.&quot;

Placing her hand on her chin and rubbing it thoughtfully, Setsuka
replied, &quot;I see... It seems I&#39;ll have to wait for him to come back
to Japan, then...&quot; This was mostly to herself, in a sort of mutter.
With that, she nodded again. &quot;I understand. Thank you for the
information.&quot; With that, she looked at the procession once more
before going back inside.

&quot;What was that all about?&quot; Xianghua queried. Mi-na shrugged. Kilik
shook his head. It was Talim that answered, making everyone turn
their head.

&quot;She has such a melancholy wind around her... anger and sadness...
someone she loved had died recently. Her heart can&#39;t accept it,
and she&#39;s looking for solace.&quot; She looked at Mi-na and frowned,
a bit worried. &quot;Could it be that...&quot; The Korean put two and two
together and nodded.

&quot;It&#39;s highly possible. I&#39;m sure the guy died without regrets-
Mitsurugi is someone who fights for his own personal honor, not
just for a strong weapon. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s come to the realization
by now that firearms aren&#39;t as strong as he himself is.&quot;

They all nodded, but Talim was still worried. &quot;She walked as if she
had some skill about her. You noticed it, didn&#39;t you? Could he be
in real danger this time?&quot; Mi-na shrugged. What the mercenary did
was none of her business...

&quot;He&#39;s got enough skill to take on anyone. If anything, I&#39;m sure the
two of them are an even match. Anyways, he&#39;s none of our business
unless he becomes a problem. Let&#39;s just go back to our rooms and
such.&quot;

They nodded, and parted ways.

________________________________________________________________________

Setsuka had heard everything. She was pissed...

(They mock my skill! It is a blatant disregard for what my master had
taught... but they are not my enemy. I must avenge him... my heart
cannot rest until my memories of him are sated. Still, they have a
point. I have no idea what his level of skill is, compared to mine.

If Mitsurugi were able to defeat him... he would give me no more than
a fleeting thought! I must train harder!)

With that, she walked towards her room, a determined and vengeful
scowl twisting her once graceful features. The ones outside had
hit closer to the mark than they realized. Setsuka was heavily
underestimating her opponent. She had to continue training and
keep improving, until her technique was flawless and had no holes
in attack or defense.

She would do so tonight, while the others were asleep. She did not
want to reveal her aims thus far... especially not to a coulple of
strangers, however talented they seemed. Indeed, the casual and easy
stances with their weapons suggested that they had several years of
training under their belts, and the various gazes and glints in their
eyes spoke of combat.

Lots of it. Far more than her.

She sighed as she entered her room, taking the pins out of her hair.
Before she slept, she had the decency to admit she was anxious; afraid.
If she lost... or even died... the training would be for nothing. She
had one shot at avenging the master who had raised her and taught her
everything she knew.

(Master... father... give me strength.)

________________________________________________________________________

Of course, that night brought Talim to wakefulness. The wind of the
night brought the sounds of the night with it, and all the world&#39;s
souls, though it was an age of tumultuous battles and great evil, were
still and at peace. Her eyes opened, an almost excited gleam in them.
She had a smile- nay, a grin on her face as the air that swept through
the halls and the rooms- every cell of her being took it in and turned
it to power and energy.

Her body had been trained to respond to the winds- such a pure, clean
wind was invigorating. Her very soul wanted to cry out in joy at the
cleansing aura of the evening breeze. She breathed in deep while she
lay still. Her eyes closed as she began hearing sounds in the back
of her head- the distant murmurs of conversations, warmth and cheer.
For the moment, at least, the world was at peace and all was right.

She stretched her senses outward, extending them to the farthest
reaches that she could achieve. More distance meant more power and
clarity of the voices and sounds in the immediate area. She felt
life in this wind. Sheer, untainted life. It flowed through her like
some kind of river that was made only of energy, and she sighed
happily as she stretched out.

Talim rose to her feet slowly, as if weighted down by all that she 
heard and felt- the power that flowed within her was so great tonight 
that she could not endure it- not while she was asleep. She had to
dance, sing... do something to celebrate this temporary rebirth of
the world. However, before she could take one step outside, something
in the wind shifted.

Another emotion... another voice. The overwhelming sense of loss
and searing anger filled her, and she knew at once who was walking
past her door. The woman from before. It was not obvious at first
what she was feeling or thinking at the time, but it was clear that
she had things on her mind. She could not read minds- that was
not the aim of the wind, or so she had been taught.

What she could do was read hearts and read emotions. Read whether 
someone was tainted with evil or not. She could even read what was
wrong with them physically- she was a shaman in training, and was
meant to cleanse evil and heal wounds. The very essence of healing
was within the Krita-Yuga; that much, she could tell. She could perhaps,
use it to some extent- but she did not know.

For the moment, all she knew was that someone was in pain, and as her
very nature demamded, she would try to console them- try to get to
the heart of the matter and settle it. She did not count the danger
to herself- Talim never did. She was constantly worried about others,
always seeking to find some point of balance within them.

(This woman... she has been undone by the death of this person.
I have to solve this- find out what is wrong.)

Silently, Talim followed the Setsuka until they were both outside, with
the woman in the elaborate silk kimono outside in the courtyard and her
in the wooden walkway, watching. For a while, everything was silent.
Nothing but the fireflies stirred in the night, with the paper lamps
in the corners and walkways of the courtyard and in the alleyway
being the only things lighting the area, besides the moon itself.

Then, without warning, Setsuka held the back end of her parasol, and
there was a flash of steel. Talim felt the intent of the attack before
it came, and knew at once what Mi-Na had guessed for a brief moment,
earlier that day.

She was indeed armed, and could have killed them on the spot, were 
they less trained in a physical sense and even less prepared mentally.

Flashes of steel amongst the silk and oil paper parasol could be
seen as Setsuka fought off hordes of invisible enemies, whirling and
dancing as if she were the center of a storm. Each blow was filled
with malace and hatred, as if every unseen target she carved into
were an object of her ire.

As if they were all the man who killed the one that were dear to her.

Talim was hit with this anger and malice as if it were a tangible
force, and she had to stop herself from crying out. She simply
watched as Setsuka sharpened and honed her rage, nursing her grudge
against her future opponent. She could not let this continue, but
she knew not how to stop it. The only thing she could do was
hang on for dear life- sometimes the vengeful emotions and thoughts
of someone this focused could become a part of the shaman...

It was a form of possesion worse than being inhabited by a demon.

However, the dance of death slowed... then stopped. Setsuka had
trained in this art for so long and so often that the routine was
over before it had begun, and yet every movement flowed into the next
as if each was made for the other. However, as she heard a noise-
as if someone&#39;s legs were giving out against the wooden floor- she
turned and looked towards Talim.

&quot;Please,&quot; she said as a tear fell from her eye. &quot;Please... no more.&quot;
________________________________________________________________________

Setsuka did not notice anyone behind her. She was so entirely focused
on her training that she heard nothing. And Talim had hidden her steps
in even the soft sounds of the breeze anyway- she couldn&#39;t have heard
unless she had listened quite intently. And she could do that. But for
now, she was qutie focused on perfecting her technique

Her mind blurred with images of her master- the sword master who had
raised her and trained her. When she heard that he had lost to a man
named Heishero Mitsurugi, she wondered if he had lost his talents.
He was the best that she had ever seen, and he came home with such
injuries that he was on the brink of death.

Setsuka&#39;s eyes hardened, turning into angry, glinting gemstones instead
of brown eyes. Once she reached the outer courtyard, her eyes closed,
focusing on her opponent. She had never met the man before, but
had heard descriptions of him. His style, his armor, his hair and eyes.
She almost had a clear picture of him in his mind now...

And once she did, she began her kata.

It was a blur of motion, her blade flashing as if it moved on its own.
She just plain moved that fast. Each cut and slash was meant to cause
so many wounds and injuries, it was completely impossible to recover
in the last few minutes that her opponent had left. There would
just plain be too much blood loss. There was no more painful or
disgraceful way to die... and it was exactly how she liked it.

She focused her rage into every cut and slash, making each part of
her sequence count. (You will die for this, Mitsurugi. I will
destroy you until there is nothing left. But first... I will
make you suffer. You will watch as I cut out your heart with one
movement... and then pierce it with my blade. I will make you
pay for killing my master!)

Her breathing was labored as she finished her movements, sheathing her
weapon again. However, as soon as her iaito made a quiet click, she
heard something behind her. As she turned in a slight surprise,
she saw the little girl from earlier, on her knees and crying. She
quirked an eyebrow as the tears fell, and noticed that the girl
was looking at her with a mixture of horror and pity.

&quot;Please... please, no more. I don&#39;t want to feel any more of it...&quot;

Setsuka looked over at Talim with a quirked eyebrow. What was she
blabbing about? She was interesting, that was for sure. In any
case, she decided to ask her what she was talking about. &quot;Feel what?
What ails you?&quot; She could see no cut or bruises... unless the ailment
was of the mind. Still, she waited for the girl dressed in green to
awnser.

&quot;You,&quot; she said. &quot;Your pain is clear to me... I can feel it as
if it were my own. The wind cries.. it weeps for you. Can&#39;t you
hear it?&quot; Indeed, the wind did seem to increase and decrease in
intensity, as if it had a voice. She heard... and looked at Talim in
a mild shock. Well, not entirely a mild shock.

&quot;Did you...&quot;

Talim wiped her tears away and stood shakily. &quot;Someone you loved was
taken from you, wasn&#39;t he?&quot; Setsuka gasped. Now, that was unexpected.
&quot;What... what are you talking about? How did you know-&quot; But she was
cut off. It had been confirmed, and Talim continued to avoid being
interrupted. &quot;You are in pain and suffering because no one cared
for you; no one truly understood you but him. The wind mourns for
you- you need not drown yourself in sorrow...&quot;

At this, she got angry. &quot;You know nothing. You have not been through
what I have; have not had people look at you in fear. What would you
do if you were looked at in fear for most of your life? If no one
tried to extend their hand to you, for fear of being diseased by
your very skin?&quot;

Talim shook her head. She would not be swayed. &quot;No. I don&#39;t. I&#39;m not
you.&quot; She walked over to Setsuka, knowing perfectly well the speed
of her draw. Setsuka immediately turned her face to stone. She had
re-applied her emotionless, arrogant mask... the one she usually wore
before she struck at the draw.

However, Talim did not attack. She held the goddess of death, wrapping
her arms around her midsection and stroking her back fondly. Talim was
in the arms of death at the moment, and she did nothing but soothe
her wounds. Setsuka still had the mask on... but it had cracked
signifigantly. She began shedding tears.

&quot;You are foolish, girl. I am capable of killing you before you draw
breath.&quot; Talim nodded. &quot;I know... but you must have someone to bear
your pain. You cannot survive alone forever... and you must let go
of this vengeance. I can hear the voice of your beloved...&quot; Setsuka
almost drew her weapon. This was going too far! She was crossing
a bad line...

&quot;He says to release your grudge. He tells me that he told you
not to hold a grudge or be vengeful. The battle he fought... was
the most honorable and satisfying fight he had ever had. Though
he died from the wounds, he doesn&#39;t feel as if he died dishonorably.&quot;

Setsuka gripped her parasol tightly as the words that he had said
before he died came back to her in full force. The tears began coming
in earnest, the mask breaking entirely. She sobbed as her eyes closed
and she dropped the parasol to the ground. All she did was let
Talim hold her as she sank to the floor. She managed to ask...

&quot;Who are you?&quot;

The priestess smiled and continued stroking the woman&#39;s back.

&quot;My name is Talim.&quot;

For tonight... she had a shoulder to cry on.
________________________________________________________________________

The next morning, Seong Mi-na walked- no, she crept silently into 
Talim&#39;s room, grinning as she did so. She too had learned how to be 
perfectly quiet when the need called for it, though the need was rare 
and times for sneaking were few and far between. Nevertheless, she 
enjoyed doing it. She knelt silently and leaned over to nuzzle her 
friend&#39;s cheek softly... before moving towards her earlobe and biting 
gently, pulling and tugging slightly.

Talim&#39;s eyes opened with a gasp as the small shockwave of pleasure shot
through her. Mi-na quickly pulled away to avoid having her nose bapped
and grinned at the shocked look on Talim&#39;s face. &quot;Nice way to wake up,
huh?&quot; Talim blushed slightly, but grinned all the same. &quot;Yes... it 
most definitely is. But I would rather have the wind wake me up than
anything else.&quot;

Mi-na shrugged and got up from her kneeling position, offering her
hand as she did so. &quot;Come on- let&#39;s go and greet the day.&quot; Talim 
nodded and walked with Mi-Na, but as they exited the room, she was 
exiting hers. A brief moment of tension and silence filled the hallway 
before Setsuka spoke.

&quot;Good morning.&quot; She bowed slightly. &quot;You are leaving today, I assume?&quot;

Mi-Na nodded and smiled warmly. &quot;Yeah. We have a lot of ground to cover-
the best thing to do would be to head for Tokyo and see if we can&#39;t
get any pertinent information there.&quot; Setsuka nodded, and rubbed her
chin thoughtfully. &quot;I do believe that those armies from yesterday were
headed to sea...&quot; Mi-na quirked an eyebrow and listened closely.

&quot;The last I heard, they were being disgraced by the Korean Costal 
Defense in one battle after another. No one had seen tactics like 
theirs before- it is as if they are invincible, in one way or another.&quot; 
Setsuka shrugged and walked towards the front entrance. &quot;If you ask me, 
it&#39;s not worth it for them all to leave like this...&quot;

As she exited, Mi-na suddenly felt an urge to head after the Japanese
armies. This was it! Her chance to prove herself! She was so close...
A battle was going to happen- she knew it. She had the experience;
the Seong heir had been in battle after battle, and was experienced
enough now to devastate an entire force.

Remembering that, though... brought her back to reality. That incident
did not need to be repeated. However, the time might come when she 
needed to defend herself against an entire horde of possesed and crazed 
fighters, and they would be much more experienced. She steeled herself, 
and began walking towards Xianghua&#39;s room, then Kilik&#39;s. When they were 
all awake, a quite determined Mi-na exited at the front of the group as 
they made their way onto the open road once again.

It was time to start looking for the fourth member of their group. 
Though whoever this was did not know of their position, they would soon,
and would have to bear it. The four of them had no idea what was to 
befall them in the island nation... but there was only one way to find 
out.

&quot;Let&#39;s get moving, guys. No time like the present!&quot;

She could not have been more right about her situation. In the next six
weeks while she was in Japan, the tide of the Seven Year War would
change forever... and Toyotomi Hideyoshi would be denied entrance to
his goal of Ming Dynasty China.

________________________________________________________________________

But that&#39;s neither here, nor there... For they were being followed
again. Ten warriors, dressed in the garb of the ninja, pursued them
from the inn, crossing the rooftops of Kyoto and slinking through the
alleyways in utter silence. By day, they would dress as commoners.
By night, they would move as swiftly as the wind, acting as shadows.

They knew that fragments of Soul Edge were in their posession. Four
of them. And they were ordered to take them- either by coersion or by
force.

It was obvious which path these seven chose.

To be continued...
________________________________________________________________________

WHOOOO!

Yeah, this one was awesome. Kinda a bit of a tale of their landing in
Japan. The current year, of course, is 1592, and for a total of 21
weeks (May 1- Nov. 1), the Japanese got their asses handed to them in a 
series of naval campaigns that is still the unbroken winning streak. The 
third set of battles at Hansan-do happens to be the turning point in the 
Seven Year War- this battle happens to be where the Japanese are 
currently headed to their impending doom at the hands of Yi Sun-sin.</pre>
