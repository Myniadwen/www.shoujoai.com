<h1>The Seeds of Evil: Phoenix Rising (part 8 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../soulcal/seedsevil-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>	The Ming Empire was about to fall. It was costantly, 
almost perpetually, raided by Japanese pirates. Their efforts
to recover the Soul Edge were their major effort to turn the
tide of battle, and restore their country. However, there
were failures in finding the Blade... three times, in fact.
The third time, it was his own personal guard that failed,
though they were the only search team that came back alive.

	Chai Xianghua was the leader of this team... and
indeed, she had found the &quot;Hero&#39;s Sword&quot;. However, she
could not allow such a weapon to exist... so she shattered
it. Unfortunately, the sword was not completely gone.
It lived on, in the form of small fragments, one of which
made it&#39;s way to a certain castle near the Empire&#39;s border.
Because of the very presence of the fragment, the castle
fell...

	Now, war was approaching. And without the Blade,
all seemed lost...

- Chapter 8: A Shattered Peace
____________________________________________________________________

	&#39;How can I reach this objective... when I can&#39;t move
freely in my own country?&#39; Indeed, because of her failure, she
had fallen out of the emperor&#39;s good graces, and was stripped 
of her rank and position. But, the worst part was... &#39;I didn&#39;t
tell Mina... and she was looking forward to being a royal guard
with me! I&#39;m no good to anyone...&#39; Xian had withheld information
once before, and if she hadn&#39;t, she would probably be back at her 
post... surely the emperor would understand that the sword was evil!

	However, she didn&#39;t tell him the fate of the sword...
and was discharged. On top of that, she felt that the fallen castle 
at the border of the empire was on her hands as well. &#39;Mina... I
just can&#39;t take you any further. If I did, then my burdens would
be upon you as well.&#39; She was therefore determined to seek the
souls herself, and destroy the sword herself. &#39;Good bye, my love.
May our paths cross again...&#39;
____________________________________________________________________

	Outside, in the darkness of the night, Mina was training, 
trying to grow into her new abilities. &#39;I&#39;ve gotta learn how to 
control this energy. How will I get any farther if I don&#39;t?&#39; She
had blinded herself agian, for she was comfotable with training
in this way. As she started her pattern dance, she began to draw a
crowd... which included a few soldiers and scouts. And they
were impressed by her display. 

	&quot;That one&#39;s good. Her technique looks like the Sheng
temple style... but there&#39;s something odd about it.&quot; One
of the scouts studied her pattern carefully... &quot;Hey, it&#39;s
mixed wih another style. Looks... Korean, to me.&quot; &quot;And, you
would know because...&quot; &quot;Well, just look! She focuses more on 
her leg moves and footwork. But her strikes are still Chinese.&quot;
&quot;Hmm... yes, you&#39;re right. I can see it now.&quot; 

	As she neared the end, the soldiers had come to a
decision. &quot;Hey, why not ask her to help us? Y&#39;know, with
the war effort?&quot; &quot;What, her? You&#39;re kidding. A lady soldier?
Get real!&quot; &quot;Well, there was Chai Xianghua. She used to be
a royal guard, so I guess that would be a novel idea...&quot;
Little did they know that Mina overheard them. &#39;&quot;Used to
be&quot;? What are they muttering about? She&#39;s the captain of
the emperor&#39;s guards! They should show some respect.&#39;

	&quot;Hey, you four!&quot; The crowd turned towards the 
soldiers... &quot;It ain&#39;t nice to talk about someone like that,
especially when she&#39;s not here in front of you!&quot; The
scout held the other men back and approached Mina. &quot;I&#39;m
assuming that you&#39;re a friend of hers, then?&quot; &quot;Yeah. What
of it?&quot; &quot;Nothing. But what we said is the truth, you know.
Xianghua was stripped of her position after she returned from
her search for Soul Edge. Of course, I think it&#39;s unfair because
of that one incident, but there&#39;s nothing I can do about it.&quot;

	One of the soldiers spoke up. &quot;But we could sure use
someone like you on our team! With moves like those...&quot;
&quot;Of course,&quot; the scout interrupted, &quot;we wouldn&#39;t want to force
you to do this.&quot; Mina scoffed at this. &quot;Hah! Even if you wanted
to, you couldn&#39;t! My life&#39;s my own. I go and do as I please, and
don&#39;t you forget that!&quot; &quot;We understand perfectly, miss... what&#39;s 
your name, by the way?&quot; She thought that they didn&#39;t deserve the
honor of knowing her name, but she gave it to them anyway.
&quot;Mina. Seung Mina.&quot; 

	The scout was pleased at this. &quot;Ah, yes, Han Myong&#39;s
daughter! I knew that style from SOMEWHERE. And that other
style was Ling Sheng Su rod, right?&quot; &#39;This guy is wierd...&#39;
Mina nodded. &quot;That&#39;s right. What of that? And how do you know my
father?&quot; The scout just smiled. &quot;All will be explained in due time.
In any case, there is a tournament approaching to determine
the next member of the royal guards. This is top-secret, though,
so if it gets out that I told anyone, It&#39;s my job.&quot; Mina was puzzled.
&quot;If you&#39;ll lose your position, then why did you just tell me?&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s not important,&quot; he said while passing Mina an invitation.
&quot;The emperor has been wanting to see you again, anyway. Please come
to the royal gardens tomorrow.&quot; Then they continued their rounds.
____________________________________________________________________

	&#39;Hmm... I guess that it wouldn&#39;t be a real problem if I
entered. And once I win, I can ask about Xianghua. Besides, it 
sounds like fun!&#39; However, something within Mina compelled her to 
seek advice from her weapon for this, and she did so. 
&#39;The emperor desires the Soul Edge to a great extent. He is 
concerned with possesing its power to himself, so that he may be 
known for slaying those pirates on his own.&#39; Mina was now certain 
that she&#39;d have to enter the tournament, and warn the emperor of 
this folly. &#39;And,&#39; she also suggested, &#39;We&#39;ll have to deal with 
those pirates as well.&#39; &#39;I advise against this. It is a numerous 
force. Even with my aid, you are sitll human... and can still be slain.&#39;

	&#39;So? They&#39;re tearing the country apart! We HAVE to do 
something!&#39; &#39;Be patient. We shall have our chance at them soon.&#39;
Mina doubted that... but she agreed to wait. Until then, she would 
have to save her energy... so she went to bed. But it was not a
peaceful sleep... she wondered what business her father had in
China, and why she was so well-known amongst the military circles.
But, of course, the main thing she worried about was whether the
emperor remembered her or not. It had, after all, been a while
since she was in China, and if the emperor did not recall meeting 
her, it would make negotiations very difficult. But she
deciced to cross that bridge when she came to it...
____________________________________________________________________

	Xian had doubts about going on her own. &#39;I don&#39;t think that
I could start off on my lonesome, like last time... I feel
stronger when I&#39;m with others who have a common purpose. I have
a connection with those who travel with me...&#39; But she felt
that the connection between her and Mina was severed. &#39;If I
tell her, will that trust be gone? When I think about that...
I get scared. Scared that I&#39;ll lose my best friend, the one that
I love. But what can I do?&#39; Now she thought that it was
a poor idea to run away from Mina. &#39;I won&#39;t make the same mistake.
But, where would she be? I&#39;ve run for quite a while, and now I&#39;m 
lost...&#39; 

	But it was also a bad idea if she was found. Since the
attacks from Japan intensified, there was a guard placed on every
road in the capital, and every one of them knew who she was and 
where she was supposed to be. &#39;At that castle... but I promised
myself that I wouldn&#39;t go back there until I destroyed all
the pieces. That way, that would be the only one left. I can&#39;t
get caught...&#39; As if that were a cue, a patrol approached her 
position. &#39;CRAP! What timing!&#39; She called to the Krita-Yuga for
strength and, after it gave her what she needed, she jumped
up to the nearest roof.

	&quot;Oy, did you hear sumthin&#39;?&quot; The guard looked down 
the alley where Xianghua used to be. &quot;Probably a stray breeze.
You should get a little rest; you&#39;re hearing things.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I am a little tired...&quot; They walked away... and Xian
let out a sigh of relief. &#39;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back. I thought you 
were lost forever, you know.&#39; Indeed, the Krita-Yuga was lost
in the battle against the demon named Inferno. Feeling that
it&#39;s purpose was fulfilled, it vanished from sight, along
with the Dvarpa-Yuga. But, as if it&#39;s mission were unfinished,
it mysteriously returned to Xianghua&#39;s possesion.

	&#39;Well, we can&#39;t stay here for long. I have to find the 
inn.&#39; And with that, she channeled her energy through the weapon
and called out to the Scarlet Thunder. When her weapon pointed in 
its direction, she smiled. &#39;I knew that practicing that little
trick would come in handy!&#39; And she jumped from roof to roof
in that direction.  
____________________________________________________________________

	The next morning, Mina was awake and alert. She felt
a strange excitement in the air that day. &#39;It must be the
tournament!&#39; Then, she realized... &#39;Crap! I forgot to sign up!
I gotta hurry!&#39; She headed to the emperial palace at the heart 
of the city with the intention of beating the rush. Fortunately, 
she fell into her usual pattern of waking up early. She usually did 
this for training purposes... and now, she was thankful that she
did it as a habit. &#39;Well, all I have to do now is check and
see if they&#39;re open.&#39; As fate would have it, they were...

	&quot;Well, then! I thought that someone would show up early!
Yeah, you beat the rush!&quot; &quot;Yeah, I guess so! So, how do I sign up?&quot;
The officer took out a paper and a pen and started explaining.
&quot;Well, all you have to do is write your name and dicipline on this 
sheet. Then, you&#39;re set to go!&quot; Mina was somewhat disappointed...
&#39;Xian&#39;s name isn&#39;t on here... where is she, anyway?&#39; Mina shrugged it
off and signed the sheet. &#39;Oh, well. She&#39;ll get to watch me win!&#39;
But then, she hit a snag. &#39;Dicipline... that&#39;s right! I have a
mixture of two styles... so I have to think of my own name.&#39;

	Mina didn&#39;t have time for this, she had a tournament to win!
But still, she had reached a big point in her life... she was creating 
her own style. She wanted a name that would be remembered...
something legendary and cool. &#39;Hmm... I can&#39;t use &quot;Mina&#39;s Long 
Sword... it sounds too much like father&#39;s! So, then...&#39; Then, she had
it. One of Kilik&#39;s moves led her to the perfect description of
her style... she wrote down her dicipline as &quot;Phoenix Talon&quot;.

	And so, she joined the procession of warriors to the
imperial gardens for the day&#39;s festivities... and the fighters 
included one young girl from India whose name was Talim. 
____________________________________________________________________

	Xian saw this procession as well, and she could sense
Mina&#39;s soul... and one other. A pure heart amongst the host of
greedy mercenaries and cold assasins... and on top of that, her
soul was strong. &#39;Maybe she&#39;s one of the six... but I can&#39;t go.
Mina will have to handle this one. I&#39;ll tell her everything later.
For now, I think I&#39;ll watch the tournament...&#39; But she also
had to think of a way in...

	Meanwhile, Mina heard the voice of the persona within her
weapon. &#39;I feel a strong presence amongst this rabble. Can you not
sense it?&#39; Mina didn&#39;t want to stop to look around, but she had
to know who this was... &#39;No, but I&#39;d like to know how...&#39; &#39;Simply
call out to the presence with your soul, and hopefully, it 
will awnser.&#39; &#39;Hopefully, huh? Well, here goes.&#39; She closed her eyes
and concentrated on the source of energy... and the image of
a young woman who looked about fifteen appeared in her mind&#39;s eye.

	&#39;She looks like she&#39;s from India... very pretty, too.
And she IS strong! If she&#39;s one of the souls I&#39;m looking for, 
then this&#39;ll be convienient!&#39; &#39;True. But the fight against her 
will be difficult. Be prepared for anything.&#39; &#39;Right.&#39; But Mina
still focused on her beauty... &#39;She&#39;s really pretty...&#39; 
&#39;Stay focused. You are attracted to her because she has a great
amount of energy within her, and nothing more. You must stay
focused, understand?&#39; Mina was snapped back to reality by
the voice. &#39;You&#39;re right. Besides, I love Xianghua. I can&#39;t be
so fickle and easily swayed.&#39; &#39;You are maturing, Mina.&#39;
She was glad that someone finally noticed that she wasn&#39;t a child.

-End

	So, what do you think? I think it was a good chapter.
My first real fight scenes begin in the next chapter! I could
use some suggestions... you know by now where to go!

- Next Episode -

	As Mina enters the fray, she continues her search for 
Xianghua, while trying to befriend the young woman from
India. Meanwhile, Xianghua must get inside to support her
friend and tell her what has been weighing her heart.
And what of the Japanese pirates? Will the attack take place,
just as the persona foretold?
