<h1>The Seeds of Evil: Phoenix Rising (part 16 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../soulcal/seedsevil-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>I don&#39;t own &quot;Wait A Little While&quot;. It&#39;s an awesome
Kenny Loggins song, and I decided to borrow it.

Me no own, you no sue.

Wait a little while to welcome what you&#39;re after
Give it the time to find it&#39;s way to you
As soon as you no longer try, you&#39;ll turn and and find
It staring in your eyes

Come and get it! When you let it, it&#39;ll come to you!

___________________________________________________________

The crowds were thick as always in Peking.

Well, thicker than usual, since last night&#39;s raid at
the docks. As the sun rose over the horizon, the wasteland
of what was once the warehouse district looming as a strict
reminder of the times and the unlucky tragidies that could
come.

None still had an explination, but it was clear that
whatever did this had terrible power...

However, the explination was walking through the crowds
along with two other women clothed in robes and such,
heading towards the border between China and India.
But they were going nowhere near India at all... just
towards an isolated location in the Himalayan mountain
range.

They did not look suspicious at all- either that, or the
general popluace did not pay attention. The women were
expecting either situation to be true, for they did not
exactly expect to be welcomed openly if they were caught.

As they headed for the nearest inconspicuous cart that was
headed through the mountain pass, carrying their warm
coats with them in their travel bags, the youngest looking
of the three was chanting under her breath over and over.

(Wind, give us speed and give us strength. Draw us into
your loving embrace and carry us to safety.)

The woman beside her smiled faintly. Such a fervrent
prayer- such devotion to the winds and the one who
was said to have created them, the Wind Goddess.

But the tallest one, the one who seemed the least casual,
was looking ever forward, searching for the one cart that
would get them as close to the mountains without any
trouble. She inconspicuously motioned her head towards one
that she was positive of, after a few hours.

They walked over, and casually listened in from a nearby
alley...

&quot;You headin&#39; through the mountains today?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, got some spices and such to carry over into India.
Plannin&#39; on making a real catch with this one.&quot;

The oldest woman smiled. This was their ride.

She moved her hand towards the back of the cart, and
the three of them ran towards it, jumping in the back and
getting comfortable, putting on their coats before
doing so.

Sure, it would be hot now... but not for long. At least,
not where they were going to climb.
___________________________________________________________

A young man was training in a secluded location,
balancing himself on the tip of his seven foot long
rod, eyes closed and breathing deeply.

He was still trying to rid himself of the evil within him,
even though he had learned how to command it, thanks
to Edge Master. Over time, his body became nothing
more than a vessel for the negative energies that
were within the Soul Edge, and thus, was potentially
the most dangerous man on earth.

And yet, he did nothing with this power, save for
hold it back and make attempts to purify it. Which,
regrettably, he could not.

And he was starting to believe it. If he could only have
a bit of help from the other divine treasures, then maybe
he could set things straight. But...

(No. I will not rely on a weapon to do my task for me.
They are just tools- methods of making one&#39;s soul and will
felt and realized. I will purify this energy on my own.)

But often, he felt that he needed to apologize to Xianghua
for calling her childish and such. He was taciturn and
serious that day, and was trying to concentrate on
more... important matters.

Because if the negative forces within him spun out of
his command, then there would be hell to pay, and lots
of it. He had no time for flights of fancy and games
of love.

Besides, love was as powerful of an emotion as
the evil within him. And it could get out of control
as well... He knew of nothing and no one who could
control that kind of power.

So he stayed away from it...

Suddenly, he heard something swing through the air
below him, as if someone were trying to knock his rod to
the ground, and send him tumbling. He almost smirked to
himself.

He had another thing coming.

The youmg man quickly leaned forward, bracing himself
with one hand, then grabbing his rod with the other and
springing off of the hand that was on the ground, arcing
gracefully before landing.

Unfortunately for him, his assailant was heading
for him at a ludicrous speed, his dao thrusting towards
the young man&#39;s chest.

He planted one of the ends of the rod on the ground and
used it as leverage to hop to the right, followed by a
cartwheel, both of his legs lashing out in a vertical arc
towards the attacker&#39;s head.

Easily dodged. And he was sent spinning to the ground
by a high right roundhouse kick.

&quot;Good. You were prepared for me. But you need to be
faster, or you may find yourself speared by my broadsword.
I don&#39;t dull these weapons for anyone, not even students.&quot;

The young man named Kilik rose to his feet and bowed, his
brown eyes cast humbly to the floor in acceptance of his
defeat.

&quot;Thank you, Master. I see I still have a long way to go.&quot;

&quot;...Indeed. Now clean up. I believe we are expecting
company today.&quot;

Kilik quirked an eyebrow at this. Who could he be expecting
this time? He hoped that it was Xianghua... the woman that
was here a few years ago was a welcome change as well.

Even Kilik saw the potential in this Korean woman who
seemed to favor the color red over anything else, and
who had a passion for fighting. But she lacked focus and
direction, as well as a clear way of fighting with more
than just her weapon and her technique.

In the end, they had to let her go after a while, seeing as
she was still immature and had much to learn. Edge Master
could not teach her what had to be lived, and Kilik was not
much of a help either.

To their surprise, the headstrong girl of age nineteen
agreed. She said that she needed to find her center, and
would return once she did.

(Are you coming back now, Mina? Have you found it?
If so... then help me find mine.)
___________________________________________________________

&quot;Winds of this sacred mountain!&quot;

Her still young voice echoed through the mountain pass,
clear and strong. Her hands were lifted to the sky in
praise, as if adoring the air and sky itself. An aura
of energy suddenly surrounded her as her spirit communed
with those of the mighty, frosty gales of the Himalayas.

&quot;Give us your favor this day! Allow us to pass unharmed
and unheeded, for we mean you no harm and no malice! Speak
if you will, and give your awnser!&quot;

Echoes and the sound of the wind for a few moments.

Talim&#39;s eyes closed, and she waited for an awnser, a sign,
anything to show that she was understood. Xianghua was
playing the sceptic- she had never seen this kind
of thing in action, where one took things on blind faith.

&quot;I don&#39;t see how this is going to work... maybe we should
just climb anyway, and make it through our own strength.
Besides, we don&#39;t have time for thi-&quot;

Mina put two fingers on Xianghua&#39;s lips and smiled
graciously at her in a whisper.

&quot;You don&#39;t know much about this, do you? If she believes
so strongly in this, then it has to work. You think it&#39;s
silly... I accept that. But I believe in her, just like I
believe in you. It&#39;s just how I am.&quot;

Xian still looked doubtful... until the winds suddenly
increased in force and measure.

(It&#39;s okay... probably a strong wind, or a storm coming in.
It can&#39;t be her.)

But all other doubts were erased when the powerful gust
suddenly was sucked in- no, it conciously headed towards
Talim- and shot straight into her. That was not the
surprising part... Talim had taken the gale full
blast, and only rose in the air a few inches, a foot at
the most, and simply hung there, with her back arched,
drawing the air around her in as if filling a vacuum.

(What in the Heavens is this... the wind... she&#39;s
absorbing it! But at this force and speed, she should be
dead... how?)

Talim was suddenly released from her suspended state,
dropped to the floor like a rag doll... but she managed
to land toes first, letting her ankles and knees cushion
the impact of the fall.

Slowly, her body straightened out, and her head lifted.
Xian could see no difference, seeing as her eyes were
still closed against the rushing, piercing cold of the
wind.

But as she slowly opened them, she saw Talim&#39;s body,
still standing with their back turned to them and her
arms now at her sides.

&quot;Are we done here? I&#39;d like to go.&quot;

Talim&#39;s voice was stoic and unemotional as she responded.

&quot;You cannot pass. Not yet.&quot;

Mina stepped forward just then, knowing that Talim had
succeeded in talking to the mountain. Why? Because
this was not Talim&#39;s tone of voice... The cold, harsh
winds of the Himalayas were speaking through her.

&quot;Well then, I do know how you admire strength. Let&#39;s
get this over with, then.&quot;

&quot;No, not you. I remember you well... such passion
for a fighter, and such a strong will. I like you.&quot;

The voice sounded like it had a warmer tone in it,
as if a friendly breeze had come to visit the cold
valleys and ridges. Yes, the mountain respected her.

&quot;It is the other one... that I will test.&quot;

Xianghua looked in awe, and was more than a little
confused.

&quot;Wha? Test me for what? What are you talking about, Talim?&quot;

&quot;Talim is no longer here. She has given her control to me,
and I will test you as I see fit, to see if you are
strong enough to pass through without harm. I can see that
she is your friend...&quot;

Talim&#39;s body turned around and her eyes opened, revealing
a cold, icy light blue, rather than the soft, warm brown.

&quot;So the question is... can you fight one who you feel so
strongly for? Can you fight one of your friends as if your
life depended on it?&quot;

Xianghua got into a ready stance, though she was somewhat
frightened at this point. Whatever this was- it was not
going to let her go that easily, or that peacefully either.

&quot;Good. But I can smell your fear... it will be your undoing.&quot;

The spirit of the mountain forced Talim&#39;s body into a
fighting stance, and narrowed her eyes in determination.
Talim however, though she had the potential to fight the
influence of the spirit who was sharing a body with her,
did nothing but trust and watch.

She would jump in when she was good and ready. For now...

&quot;I come! Prepare yourself!&quot;
___________________________________________________________

As the two of them meditate atop the mountain, sitting
precariously on training poles, the old hermit known
as the Edge Master opens his eyes. A cunning, knowing
look is hidden within, but no one else notices it.

(The wind has stopped. The mountain has guests, just
like I suspected. I wonder who is being tested this time,
that would make the natural defenses of this place stop?)

He closed his eyes again and cleared his mind of it. No
matter who it was- they would find out soon. For now, he
would simply have to wait and see.

But he had a good hunch who the visitors were. It just
needed to be confirmed, that was all.
___________________________________________________________

Xianghua barely dodged the back end of an elbow blade as
she stepped back with her leading foot, thus turning
her body to evade the blow. She then stepped forward with
said foot again and slammed the edge of her blade upwards
towards Talim&#39;s neck, with one hand near the point of the
sword.

(Even at this distance, she can&#39;t dodge. This was eas-)

Talim&#39;s body turned to the right, precious seconds before
the sword made contact, and her elbow blades flashed out
in a vicious circle just as she was at Xian&#39;s side, biting
into her exposed ribs twice.

Xianghua flew back a considerable distance, her body
spinning in the air before she landed heavily on the hard
packed snow.

(What speed! How did she dodge that? It was too close!)

Fear was replaced by determination as Xianghua felt the
blood leak down the cuts from her side. The Krita-Yuga
responded immediately, and the only evidence of the
cuts were the tears in her coat and clothing.

&quot;Well, fine. No mercy, then!&quot;

&quot;Good. You are ready now.&quot;

Determination mixed with frustration. Who did this...
spirit or whatever think it was, toying with her like
this? It was getting on her nerves.

&quot;I was ready before, dammit! Here I come!&quot;

She charged forward with half steps, still being
defensive while rushing forward. She may be angry,
but she did not let her anger control her. Rather,
she focused it towards her attack, and it made a
difference- she covered ground double-time.

She lunged forward with her leading foot, slicing her
sword from left to right with a twist of her torso as
she stepped forward. The swipe managed to make the
possesed Talim give ground, and the shock of steel
hitting steel sent her staggering backwards.

However, that did not stop her from going on the
offensive as she used the shock to turn her body
around and sweep one of Xianghua&#39;s feet out from
under her with a low hook kick.

Xianghua&#39;s front leg was knocked out from under her,
and with a look of surprise, she was sent to the floor
again, her legs crossing at an awkward angle. She
managed to get right back up again...

Just as Talim decended on her with a front sault that
went far too high for just a normal jump, and lashed
out with both of her elbow blades in a vertical arc
on her way down. She barely had enough time to block
the strike, but she did.

But the strain was a bit much, and though the weapon
withstood the enhanced strength that the mountain
winds gave Talim&#39;s body, her arms felt the shock, and
the reverberations shook her body ever so slightly.

&quot;Impressive. Anyone else would have broken under the
strain by now. Tell me... what makes you so strong?&quot;

Xianghua was starting to get irritated with all
these questions. In battle, idle conversations had
no place, and no meaning. How was she going to get
past this obstacle if it was so noisy?

Did she plan on mocking her with these questions?

She would not give her the satisfaction!

&quot;None of your business, whoever you are!&quot;

She turned to the left, allowing the elbow blades
to follow through and Talim to stagger forward.
while she turned, she cut through the air, leaping
as she did so.

With her side completely exposed and her in a bad
position, Talim took the hit. Pain registered on her
face, and for a split second, frozen blue reverted to
a deep brown again.

Xianghua didn&#39;t see it.

As Talim cluched her side in pain, the wielder
of the Krita-Yuga decided to have her stay down for a
while. So she raised her sword over her head, lifting
her right knee as she did so. Then, she brought the
back end of the sword down on Talim&#39;s head, her foot
slamming onto the ice in a quake step.

With the combination of the reverberaion and the attack,
Talim fell easily, and fell hard- face first, of course.

As Xianghua backed away slowly, afraid that she had hurt
Talim badly, she called out in a nervous voice.

&quot;If you want some more, then get back up. I won&#39;t guarantee
that you&#39;ll ever get up again when I&#39;m done, though.&quot;

Surprisingly, a laugh. One that seemed cold and bitter,
but a laugh anyway.

&quot;Very well done. You are a strong one indeed.&quot;

Talim&#39;s body rose slowly, and a smile was presented, even
with a bleeding cut and a bruise on her face. She made
no effort to move, but simply asked the question again.

&quot;What makes you so strong?&quot;

Xianghua started to become frustrated again. What
was the meaning of that question? It was her own strength
that got her through this. If this hadn&#39;t happened to Talim,
if she had only been allowed to pass...

&quot;It&#39;s the fact that Talim was possesed by something as
heartless and cold as you that made me fight like that.
Otherwise, I don&#39;t think I could do it.&quot;

Another laugh.

&quot;I see. So you care for her.&quot;

&quot;If you wanna call it that, then yes I do.&quot;

Her lips frowned slightly and her eyes narrowed.

&quot;You lie to yourself and to your friends. If you had not
cared, you would not fear for her life, even though you
are the one who is the threat.&quot;

&quot;Say that again, and I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;ll keep you alive.&quot;

&quot;Even if it means killing her?&quot;

Xianghua grimaced at this, but stood firm.

&quot;Evil has to be destroyed, no matter what the cost.&quot;

A smile... then a laugh. A genuine, long, loud laugh.

&quot;Evil? Is that what I am? This is my mountain, and I
choose who passes and who does not. If I am evil for
protecting this sacred ground, then so be it. And for the
last time, I did not possess this girl. She allowed me
to enter her. Or do you not have faith in the capabilities
of your friends?&quot;

Xianghua winced at this. Another point for the winds..
If anything, her stubbornness showed mistrust in her
friends. But she was still not convinced that Talim had
allowed this to happen.

&quot;I don&#39;t believe you.&quot;

&quot;Then maybe I should test your strength a bit further.&quot;

Talim&#39;s body got into a ready stance again, and the winds
began to pick up in intensity and fury. It was all that
Xianghua could do to keep her footing...

(Wait!)

Xianghua&#39;s eyes widened in surprise. She had forgotten about
the bond between herself, Mina, and Talim! Though her and
Talim were a weaker bond, due to a connection through Mina,
it was still there.

(Talim? You&#39;re still there?)

(Yes. Please, don&#39;t fight anymore. You don&#39;t trust me,
do you? I understand- we&#39;ve only just met a few days ago.
But just this once, please believe. I needed an awnser from
the winds that protected this mountain- and I got one.)

Xianghua was stunned for a moment, then she responded.

(What was the awnser?)

(One needed to prove their strength to climb towards the
valley that is hidden within these mountains. They told
me that it was a sacred place where one could hide
themselves from the evil that is spreading through the
world.)

Of course. That would explain everything. If someone
truly evil passed through here, they would not be able
to find it. Surely one would die on the mountain, whether
they were strong enough or not...

(Um... I feel kind of silly now. Forgive me?)

A smile could be felt from Talim&#39;s direction, even though
the sybil was not in control.

(Yes, I forgive you. Please, don&#39;t fight anymore.)

Reluctantly, Xianghua lowered her weapon... and the winds
that had commanded Talim&#39;s body forced her mouth to smile.

&quot;So then, you believe now.&quot;

She only nodded, looking very sheepish and embarrased.

&quot;Good. You are strong, but lack faith in your friends.
You do not believe what cannot be explained, though you
are the bearer of the Krita-Yuga, which defies all
explination, and chase down a sword which refuses to
be destroyed.&quot;

She began walking toward Xianghua.

&quot;You must see with another pair of eyes to find your destiny,
and here you have two pairs... but still, you do not trust.
How will you survive the trials ahead if you lack trust?&quot;

Xianghua felt like she was being lectured like a small
child. Then again, she deserved it. After all, she had
seen what had happened before her, and turned a blind eye.

&quot;I don&#39;t deserve to climb.&quot;

&quot;All the more reason that I will let you pass. Beyond
this mountain, you will learn what you need to know, and
find what you have been seeking. And maybe then... you
will learn to trust your companions without a doubt or a
fear.&quot;

And then, there was silence.. an eerie, cold silence.
Xianghua looked up at Talim again, a little puzzled.

&quot;Something wrong?&quot;

&quot;Yes... if Talim is taken out of her trance, then she
will feel great pain. Would you...&quot;

Oh. That was simple enough. She wondered why she had not
thought of that earlier...

&quot;All right.&quot;

Xianghua closed her eyes and gripped the handle tightly,
allowing her energy to channel through the sword. Her hand
glided up the flat of the blade until it shone with a faint,
light blue aura, a slight hum sounding off from the steel.

Then, she quickly placed the flat of the blade on Talim&#39;s
forehad and pressed it gently. Fortunately, that was all
it took for the spiritual powers of the blade to pass
through Talim, and her cut was healed, her bruise was gone,
and her eyes opened again.

A thankful look was in Talim&#39;s deep brown eyes.

&quot;Thank you, Xianghua.&quot;

She then looked up at the mountain, and smiled.

&quot;And thank you, for letting us pass.&quot;

Mina, who was watching this from the background, only
smiled. They were getting along nicely, and that was
important for what they were going to do. She spoke
up finally, after being silent through the whole ordeal.

&quot;You guys ready now? Let&#39;s hurry up and get over this
rock- I&#39;m hungry and tired!&quot;

The three of them managed to laugh. Demanding and
insistant, just like the fire that she was.

They wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.
___________________________________________________________

The sun beat down on them merrily as they climbed the
mountain, though the air was much cooler. Fortunately,
without the cold wind blowing, they made better time
than most did, seeing as they weren&#39;t freezing.

Mina was the only one who did not feel the eventual
effects of said sun- in fact, she was enjoying herself.
The mix of hot and cold air was refreshing to everyone,
but Mina enjoyed the heat a bit more than the cold.

Talim didn&#39;t mind at all. She was one with everything
in nature, and could adapt to most anything.

Xianghua had only been up here once, but she was still
confident as always. The fine weather was a sign that
she was strong enough, and she beamed with a hint of
pride, but mostly relief that things had turned out
so well.

But they still had to climb, and still had to walk the
rough, stony path. No one minded, though... they were
heading towards safety, after all.

As they reached the top, Mina pointed out over the range,
down towards the small, secluded ruins and lake, with
the training poles visible even from here.

&quot;There it is. Beautiful, huh?&quot;

Talim loved the scene before her, and Xianghua was
excited as well- mostly because she got to see Kilik.
Sure, she cared for Mina more, but it was always fun to
stop by every once in a while to see how the knucklehead
was doing.

&quot;It sure is,&quot; Talim said wonderingly. &quot;Do we go down?&quot;

Xianghua just nodded in agreement, her mind somewhere else
at the moment.

&quot;Sure thing. I&#39;ve seen this view enough times to get bored
of it, anyway. Let&#39;s head out.&quot;
___________________________________________________________

As they headed down the path, Kilik was training, as he
usually spent his days doing. Flailing and swinging his
rod in a pattern dance, he moved with grace and ferocity,
from one move to the next in rapid succession. Even as
he moved however, he could sense three people coming
down the mountain path, and smiled vaugely to himself.

(You were right, master. There were guests coming today.
Good thing we cleaned up, huh?)

He finished his kata and simply stood there, looking up
toward the path that led into the valley. If his hunch was
correct, there were only a few people he knew of who the
winds would receede for.

So who was this new person?

He wondered briefly if he should tell his master about
this, but shrugged that off. He had enough to deal with as
it was- Kilik would deal with this himself.

He need not have worried too much- it was Seung Mina and
Xianghua, along with another guest- a young girl, from
the look of things. She looked no more than fifteen, but
had an aura of calm and tranquility that seemed to spread
through the air.

He had a feeling that she was no real problem, even
with the odd looking weapons that she had with her.

&quot;Welcome, everyone. Mina, Xianghua, good to see you again.&quot;
Talim bowed slightly, and Mina just stood there, appraising
him with a sort of sour look on her face.

(You act so calm on the outside, and act as if nothing
happened... I&#39;ll get you later for making Xian cry.)

&quot;Who is this? A new friend?&quot;

Talim looked towards him, as if noticing him for the first
time. Which she was- the young priestess had been taken
in by the beauty of her surroundings. But once she did,
she regretted it. The same ill wind threatened to
consume her again, and she raised her weapons defensively.

&quot;S... stay back!&quot;

The three of them looked at her with puzzled expressions.

Xianghua spoke up first, quickly assesing the situation.
Kilik still had his evil aura about him, though he could
manage to keep himself sane and his wits about him.

&quot;It&#39;s your.. y&#39;know. She&#39;s sensitive to it. Don&#39;t worry
about him, Talim, he&#39;s-&quot;

&quot;No, Xianghua. It&#39;s all right. I figured that someone
would come along sooner or later and be frightened.&quot;

He sighed to himself and opened his mouth to explain,
but Talim stopped him.

&quot;I know... I know what you did. I know that it was not
under your control. And I feel pity for you... but
still, I&#39;m scared... please, just let me be for now.
I&#39;m sure that I&#39;ll get used to it, but for now...&quot;

Kilik simply nodded.

&quot;All right. I&#39;ll get my master while you guys get
settled. Wait right here.&quot;

With that, he went off to get Edge Master...

Who was right behind Mina.

&quot;No need for that. I&#39;m here.&quot;

Talim and Xianghua turned with surprise, but Mina
stayed there with her back turned, smiling. She had
come to expect the fact that the old man could be
as quiet as he damn well wanted to be, seeing
as he was a seasoned warrior.

&quot;How&#39;s things, old man?&quot;

&quot;Still lacking respect, I see.&quot;

Mina turned at this, her hands on her hips and a mock
pout on her face.

&quot;Nah, I call you old man because I like you. Didn&#39;t
I tell you that a while back? You must forget more
than I thought.&quot;

The old hermit smiled. If he was irritated, it was
mild at best, and went away quickly.

&quot;You mistake me for some aged man who keeps his
mind in disarray. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll think differently
when wer&#39;re done here.&quot;

Talim was in awe of the man. The winds spoke volumes
of him- so much that her head was buzzing with voices.
She was slightly dizzy for a moment, then spoke with
a wondering tone.

&quot;Excuse me... you are the master of this place?&quot;

He turned and regarded her, his piercing blue eyes
looking straight through her.

(This is a strong one, for such a young age. Perhaps
she could be useful in the times to come. We will
see.)

He bowed to her after the appraising look.

&quot;Yes. Most call me Edge Master, but I am just a simple
hermit who can swing a sword. Nothing special.&quot;

&quot;I beg to differ! The air around you is filled with
years, and your strength is much too deep and wide
for a mere swordsman. I should be bowing to you.&quot;

And she did so, lower than even he bowed to her. She
felt like she didn&#39;t belong in the presence of such a
man. But then, she felt a hand on her head, and opened
her eyes.

&quot;You&#39;re a good girl. Still learning about the world,
but so confident. I like that.&quot;

He turned towards his house and started walking.

&quot;Come, let&#39;s get you all inside! I&#39;d like to
hear what you&#39;ve been up to.&quot;
____________________________________________________________

-End-

Okay, done. Surprisingly, this one was a bit difficult
to write, seeing as I was just writing off the top of my
head. Well, that and I was bored... but whatever. As per
uaual, let me know what you think.

- Next Chapter -

In which Mina explains her newfound abilities with the
Flames of Passion, and starts on the path to understanding
