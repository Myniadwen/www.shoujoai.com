<h1>The Seeds of Evil: Dragon Rising (part 5 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../soulcal/seedsevildr-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Hoko Temple.

Located within the mountain ranges surrounding the Kyoto region, it 
was constructed in Kyoto in the 17th year of Tensho under the proposal 
of Hideyoshi Toyotomi. The temple was officially created to pray for 
the peace and stability of the nation, but it had a hidden agenda of 
&quot;katana-gari&quot; to prevent the constant rioting of farmers. In a secret 
underground hall there is a standing Buddha statue 24 meters tall set 
within the center of a huge fusui-ban which Yin-Yang masters would 
consult in their advice to Hideyoshi and his strategists for conquering 
the country. 

However, in construction of the great hall Hideyoshi cut down a several 
thousand-year-old cedar tree on Yakushima Island and used the weapons 
collected from the katana-gari for iron for the huge Buddha statue. In 
ancient times the Japanese word &quot;ki&quot; meaning wood and another word &quot;ki&quot; 
meaning spirit were one and the same. People believed wood and trees 
had holy spirits and the word &quot;kodama&quot; literally meant &quot;spirit of a 
tree&quot; and now &quot;echo&quot;. 

Thus by killing a great life to make the hall and using the statue 
forged from iron that had tasted the blood of men it was only natural 
that this place would bear the seeds of disaster as it shed its dark 
pulse. The evil spreading from the underground sanctum is now building
to a fever pitch, due to the outbreak of evil energy in the area.

The situation is coming to a critical point.

The defenders of the mountain and forest- the Fu-Ma ninja- are gone; 
nowhere in sight. The demons and goblins within the temple rise forth, 
massing an army. And within the mountain, in the underground shrine, the 
largest concentration of shards besides the cursed sword itself resonate 
in response to the evil.

Chapter 5- Restless
_________________________________________________________________________

The Krita-Yuga stirred as they approached closer with each step, the
mounts that they had picked up from the capital becoming increasingly 
worried. Mi-na had to reassure her horse several times, whispering into 
its ear almost constantly. She had learned how to do such things during 
her various travels, though that story is for another time. Talim rode 
with Mi-na, her very presence calming the animal a great deal.

Still, the horse was uneasy.

Kilik had his own ride, and the Dvapara-Yuga fragment around his neck
shone and pulsed brightly, as if it too sensed what was coming. Of 
course, the fragments could only do so much, and only one time. Then
he was on his own. Fortunately, it was not entirely that weak to begin
with- the mirrored sash was most definitely a powerful artifact.

Its cleansing aura shone brightly, a ward against the chaos. However,
if he used it in its nature to cleanse the land of impurity, its sheen
would dim, then fade. Therefore he had to be careful of how and when he
used such power. His guilt was evident in every piece of the mirror he
carried, and was reflected outward every time.

Such negativity could not be a good source of energy for long.

Still, it had worked so far. He continually went on a quest to cleanse
what he had in fact gained command of during his training with Edge
Master, though he did not believe it completely under his control.
It is said however, that if one keeps their will and soul together and
their mind strong, then they can not only win over the destructive
energies... but control them.

Kilik did not want to go that far.

Still, he had heard of Mi-na using her very own instincts of the same
destructive nature to punish a band of unlawful and ruthless pirates
who had taken her friends from her, thus putting an end to the Japanese 
raids on the Ming Empire&#39;s coast for a while. The actions made him 
consider... whether or not he could do the same.

Xianghua rode with Kilik, and she was not entirely too sure of herself
at the moment. Her jian shone with a light that most definitely calmed
her, filled her with power. Still, it was not all that exciting to be
near such chaos. In fact, she was afraid. Very much so. She wanted to
say something... anything... but Mi-na and Talim had their minds
closed in defense from the negative energies sweeping across them.

Her grip tightened on the Krita-Yuga as they made their way ever
closer, and the aura responded to her fears by giving her strength
and soothing her frayed nerves. She needed to do this, whether she was
fearful or no. Somewhere, she found the nerve to let go of her weapon,
albiet slowly. The aura calmed and went silent as she readied herself,
somehow knowing that its job was done for now.

In any case, they had no time to talk. The edge of the forest was 
approaching. It had taken them another three days to cross the rugged 
terrain and reach this point. Had they been without mounts, it would 
have taken them longer. Much more so. Still, now that they were here... 
everything in them was screaming at them to turn back- simply move 
back to the city and skip this place.

There were many pieces of Soul Edge here... too many. The shards
within Mi-na&#39;s bag shone and hummed happily; greedily. They wanted to
be whole again- to transform into another instrument of destruction
and sorrow. Mi-na&#39;s resolve was firm however, and she pressed her
horse onward, coaxing it gently from a walk into a canter. Kilik
followed suit, and they approached the tainted woods near the temple at 
a faster gait.
_________________________________________________________________________

The forest was almost alive in its tainted energy. The wind moaned
and sighed, as if it were weeping for any who dared tresspass in these
parts. Red, glowing eyes seemed to fade in and out of view, daring any to
stare back. It seemed that even the trees themselves were moving, twisted
and gnarled with such a heavy concentration of evil that they seemed
almost to have faces; voices.

Near the temple itself, this forest was the first of many casualties that
nature had taken. The cedar that had been cut down was from here... and
the anger of the entire forest had built to a point where the vengeful 
spirits came forth to attack travellers that headed toward the temple, 
driving them away.

Indeed, it did seem that such a heavy concentration of spirits in the
area did effect something, it seemed that the ground itself was tainted,
changing color and stinking of the dead. Thus, even the nearby village was
abandoned...

Still, the forest, when properly defended, does have its serenity.
Even in this age of rifles, samurai came to this place for training their
minds and spirits in the way they had first begun- the way of the sword.
Now, even they avoid it- even the most stalwart of spirits and the most
hardened minds have gotten lost in this place, as if they were being
led on by some other force. The sheer density and size of the forest
is daunting, and none who have entered have been known to come out alive.

And recently, even at this time of day, the demons were out in force.

Leauges of the dead and the depraved were rising forth in response to...
something. Perhaps someone. In any event, they were massing for an 
offensive on nearby Kyoto, still occupied by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and a
major section of his forces. However, their madness gave them an
advantage against even the firearms technology that Toyotomi had
aquired. Those who had lost their minds did not feel pain... they
would continue moving until the last of their strength gave out.

Oh, but they could still die. It was just that there were scores of them.
Thousands. And they were all waiting for something or someone to order
their mobilization, all while gathering more poor, unwary souls to
their midst. However, today would be a problem. Four exceptionally strong
and well-informed, not to mention well-armed people were heading towards
the forest at the moment.

Some of them could sense this; others could not, and did not care. Either
way, they would be ready. Yes, they would prepare themselves to deter
these intruders from their paths and have at least one of them join their
ranks. And even if all four of them died, they would not leave this
forest. It was as much a prison as it was a maze, and they would be four
more wandering spirits, left helpless within the confines of the woods.

Of course, this meant that though most of the spirits and demons here
were vengeful and twisted... some were not. The sighs and moans of the
wind were their cries for help; for release. If someone were able to
hear these pleas, they might be able to discern the location of the
entrance to the moutain, and thus the entrance to the temple.

Of course, the four of them happened to have a wind priestess with 
them. The last one, at that. And right now, her body trembled as if she
were visibly trying to beat back the scores of evil spirits that were
trying to impose their will upon her. &quot;This place...&quot; she said with
a quiver in her voice, &quot;It scares me. I can feel them everywhere...&quot;
Shivering again, Talim held on to Mi-na, burying her face into
the older woman&#39;s back.

She was only a girl- barely sixteen. Even her strong, determined mind
and her faith in the winds had no place here, around so much evil.
Feeling her young friend&#39;s fear and Xianghua&#39;s anxiety, Mi-na tightened
her grip on the Scarlet Thunder, and at once a flood of warmth spread
from her into the young priestess, settling over her like a blanket.

The shivering stopped as the heat had a calming effect, her muscles 
relaxing from their tensed state. Talim almost sighed in relief and
gratefulness as she settled further into the Seong prodigy&#39;s body, as
if to take as much of the needed strength as she possibly could. The
brunet couldn&#39;t help but to smile and close her eyes, fully immersing
herself in the Scarlet Thunder&#39;s power.

At that point, Talim did sigh in relief. &quot;Thank you...&quot;

Mi-na nodded as she slowly opened her eyes. She did not notice the
crimson aura that had suddenly appeared around her weapon, nor did
she care. All she wanted was Talim&#39;s help, and she could not get
that while the young woman was fearful. It was cruel of her in a way,
but the comforting aura had a purpose, besides her want to see
her companions- her lovers- happy. They needed to get to those
shards before anyone else did.

(But there are way too many,) she mused to herself. (We can&#39;t keep
the four we have around forever, especially not here. We&#39;re gonna
lose our compass, but we have to seal these things away now, before
things get worse.)

And then, she was jerked out of her thoughts by the horses stopping.
Just a dead stop- so sudden that their riders were upset somewhat. 
They stamped impatiently and shook their heads. This was as far as 
they would go. The danger sense of the mounts were on full tilt,
and they would not go where they were not sure they could enter.

Mi-na nodded, understanding perfectly. She would have done the same,
had she been one of them. But she was not, and did not have the time
to just stop. &quot;Everybody off; I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be getting any more
out of our rides past this point.&quot; Talim reluctantly parted herself
from the aura of confidence that the Seong prodigy radiated and
dismounted cleanly.

She whispered a word of thanks into the horse&#39;s ear, and it actually
neighed and tossed its head in return. It was odd for Xianghua to see 
such a thing, but not Mi-na. Talim seemed to understand all life in a 
way, and the older, more experienced woman who had been trained to
sense such things could see it as plain as day.

After they gathered together, tying the horses to nearby trees,
the four of them gathered. &quot;All right, remember; we don&#39;t know 
exactly what&#39;s out here, but we&#39;re gonna try and head as far as we
can. Talim, you&#39;re leading. Try and use those senses of yours to find
out where we need to go.&quot;

Talim nodded. She knew she would be used one day for some ends, and
now it was time. But she wanted to be used- she wanted to be someone&#39;s
guide; to be their beacon. And she could tell that Mi-na only meant
good in what she was planning. Taking a few steps forward, she
found a clearing in which she could be seated, with the others 
following behind her.

There, she sat on her knees and closed her eyes, breathing as if she
were attempting to force herself to sleep. Kilik recognized it as
meditation, though it was in a different sitting position. Still,
he was confused as to why she would do it here, of all places.

&quot;What is she doing,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Don&#39;t we need to get moving
here?&quot; Mi-na hushed him, raising her left hand in order to do so.
Xianghua said nothing, only watched.

Talim was soon in a proper state of a forced sleep- a trance. She 
was aware of everything- the madness within the very trees and 
earth; the proximity of her companions- of their auras; the dormant, 
burning spirit within the Scarlet Thunder, waiting to be released; 
the calmer, more subtle Krita-yuga, Kali-yuga, and the shard of 
the Dvapara-yuga.

And she could feel the tainted aura of the wind.. as well as an
undercurrent of woe- sadness of some sort. It is this she focused
on as she began to expand her senses outward as far as they could
reach. She did not pray to the Wind Goddess... she *was* the 
Goddess. She had tapped into Her power and will, and now read the
winds as if they were an open book.

The various weapons and artifacts responded in different ways
to the expansion of Talim&#39;s spirit. Mi-na and Xianghua&#39;s weapons
resonated in sympathy. Kilik&#39;s shard of the divine mirrior glinted
slightly. The shards within Mi-na&#39;s bag whined in complaint, as if
the sheer force and quiet determination, mixed with a purity and
innocence that seemed unmatched, were a bane for them.

In time... after a few minutes... she heard something amongst the
madness.

(Help...)

Talim would have leapt for joy. There was someone here! Someone
who was not affected by this taint! That there was one meant
that there would be more, if they were made to reveal themselves. 
(Yes,) she awnsered with her own thoughts, (We are here to help. 
What is it that you wish of us?)

The voice... no, voices, spoke up, almost all at once. (She can
hear us! A way out at last! Please help me... help... it&#39;s too
much...) However, she would not be daunted. Talim was in her
element- she would not be turned aside by the sheer number of
souls that wanted release.

(Please! One at a time! Explain how we can do this for you,) she
cried out as they clamored for her attention. Many of them quieted,
compelled by her sheer presence. A few continued speaking. 

(These cursed demons and walking dead keep us jailed here. There is 
something nearby that prevents us from leaving this forest- it is
underneath this place. A shrine of sorts was built here in order
to pray for peace, but it was also to seal away the weapons of the
people, limiting them only to warriors in the service of the
ruling class.

This temple has become a source of evil... but no one can bring it
down. Not to mention the presence of something so tainted that
everything around is affected by it.)

They all agreed. Of course they could feel it- those on the spiritual
plane could sense it qutie well. And since Talim could cross the divide
between this world and theirs, she could quite easily see where they
were as well. (Soul Edge... these pieces of metal are everywhere 
underneath here! It&#39;s almost enough to...)

She almost broke from her trance. No, this would not be good at all.
Talim had been told of the blade&#39;s regenerative abilities- the ability
to forge itself anew, as long as enough shards of it were together.
This could not be permitted! They had to move quickly.

But before that... they had to make their way through this forest.

(Could any one of you lead me to this place? We need to reach it as
soon as-) That was when she heard it. The sound of a menacing growl,
as if the forest itself had come alive in response to either
her presence flowing through it, or some other catalyst. Well,
they did have four pieces of the tainted blade with them- this
entire forest may have knowledge of where they are.

She also heard and felt something moving towards her- the air was 
being parted by something. She was not mistaken as to what that 
something was. Besides, one of the spirits- that of a child, had
yelled, (Look out!)

Talim could not, from this position, reach her blades in time...
_________________________________________________________________________

High above the four of them, a woman clad in a dark blue body suit and
armor that seemed to be crafted from the heads of demons and other
beasts that were not of this earth stood precariously on the branch
of one of the trees. Her black hair was tied back in a ponytail, which
waved and whipped around as the wind increased and decreased in speed
and force.

Her brown eyes took in everything- the girl on the ground, meditating
and expanding her very soul outward, tapping into the spiritual plane
through the winds themselves; the woman who she had met and fought with
before, now posessing a much greater force than she had when they last
clashed- perhaps because of training or maturity, or simply because
of the relic that she held; the other two of whom she had heard, but
never truly met, their weapons also carrying the weight of spiritual
power.

This entire forest, for those reasons alone, would be upon them soon
enough. She was only interested in the shards of the Soul Edge they
carried. They had to get rid of them before reaching the mountain,
or else they would bear witness to the birth of an entirely new
Soul Edge.

However, this was second to her primary mission.

(Toki is somewhere... I must find him and put an end to this. These
four are of no concern, for the moment. But the little one and the
Korean... they are stronger- much more so. Their minds are free of
doubt or hesitation. The woman with the sword is overburdened by
duty and the staff wielder is weighed down by guilt. I can see
this.

What I cannot see is why they are here...)

She continued watching, to make sure. Soon, as she had expected,
the demons and possesed corpses came forth, surrounding them with
the skill of a trained and organized force. The woman grimaced as
they moved as one, and knew that time was no longer on her side.

(Something has happened in the temple. I have to move!)

And yet, she could not leave without helping these four out in
some way, or at least warning them of what was ahead. So she waited.
It would be interesting at the least to see what was going on. The
woman would have an opportunity to guage the strengths of these
individuals before they even met properly, and thus would have an
advantage of sorts.

As one of the demon horde approached the girl, she noticed that
from her position, it would be impossible to draw her weapons. She
reached toward one of the kunai that were hanging from her belt...
and stopped short, hesitating as her eyes widened in shock. The
woman she had fought with before- Seong Mi-na was her name, as
she recalled- moved so swiftly that it were as if her entire 
body were prepared to strike.

Blocking the incoming katana with the rod section of her weapon,
she seemed to appear there instead of moving. Only she and a
few others with her level of perception could see such a movement
for what it was. Still, the Korean moved *much* faster than before, 
and with such a heavy weapon at that.

The woman smiled. Seong Mi-na had finally matured into a challenge
worthy of her notice.

&quot;This will be interesting. I am compelled to stay and watch the
four of you,&quot; she mused to herself.
_________________________________________________________________________

Mi-na heard and felt it before she saw them coming. A force which was
unmistakably evil and threatening- and it came from all sides. Her eyes
narrowed slightly and her weapon pulsed as if it too could sense 
something approaching. Xianghua was informed by her Krita-yuga beginning
to shift and change in form, even before she had drawn, threatening to
break the sheath in which it was held.

She quickly drew and the weapon shifted form as she pulled it from the
scabbard, resonating at such a frequency that it gave off a slight hum.
The ice blue aura that surrounded it was shining fiercely, perfectly
aware of the evil that was approaching.

As for Kilik, he knew what was approaching by the fragment of the
Dvapara-yuga. Its sheen had increased ever since he had entered the 
forest, and now he could feel an aura of protection surrounding him.
He liked to think it was his sister, but he knew better. Still, it
was what kept him going.

Talim knew as well, though nothing outside showed it. She simply stayed
in her position, reading the winds as if nothing were happenning. But
she could feel it, just as plainly as the others. As if some sort of
signal were sent or order given, something fell from the trees. She
did not move... she could not move. If she moved abruptly or were 
disturbed in any way, it could damage her permanently.

Knowing this... Mi-na moved for her. With a speed that was virtually
untraceable, She ran to Talim&#39;s side and blocked the incoming blade.
Her eyes locked with a man that was... clearly dead. Yes, he had
died here, and the angry spirits had posessed his corpse. His eyes 
shone crimson, a mark of not only the spirits... but of Soul Edge.

So many shards were underground that the entire forest had been affected,
and she could feel that as well. This had to stop now. Upon the meeting
of one weapon with the other, the forest seemed to come out in full
force. Leaping down from the trees, coming out from under cover, the
forces were enough to consider that an army had died here and been
raised again.

&quot;Yeah, this should be interesting,&quot; Mi-na said with a smile as her
opponent leapt backwards, rebounding off of her polearm. The undead
warrior growled menacingly at her, his eyes glinting with malice. five
more emerged from the ranks of the demonic hordes, brandishing more than
just swords. One carried two blades instead of one- a pair of kodachi.
Two carried spears- each around seven feet long. One had a pair of
kama while the other had a naginata.

All things considered, there were too many long range weapons in this
bunch... meaning that the difficulty would lie in getting beyond
the barrier that the weapons posed in order to reach the target. Now
outnumbered two to one, and with Talim out of action for the moment,
it was looking farily dire.

And these were only the first six.

&quot;Well fine then,&quot; Xianghua spoke. &quot;Come on... I&#39;ve been waiting all
day for something like this since we got here. If you&#39;re going to come
and stop us from getting in, then get moving already. It&#39;s not like we
have all day.&quot; People always said that Xianghua&#39;s mouth would get her in
trouble... and this time it did, as the one with the pair of kama and
the one with two swords came rushing towards her. Xian just grinned as
she gracefully circled her hands above her, gathering her chi before 
stomping hard on the ground with enough force to produce a small 
shockwave.

The two of them were sent stumbling off balance as the wave hit, and
were dispached soon after, the Krita-yuga singing as it moved through
the air and cut cleanly through their bodies. The corrupt flesh turned
into nothing more than ash in flashes of light as she stopped a few feet 
behind them with her eyes closed.

&quot;How&#39;s that?&quot;

Her awnser was obvious as she opened her eyes again, the sight before
her making them widen in shock. They were coming, as if they were 
waiting for their comrades to die and the fighting to start.

&quot;Oh, great...&quot;

Meanwhile, Mi-na squared off against her katana-wielding foe with a grin
plastered on her face. (This guy is easy pickings,) she mused to
herself. Posession was not entirely a good thing- it was the sign of
a weak mind. And besides, the bodies were already decayed- it would
be a much slower reaction to a much faster opponent.

She was, however, worried about Talim and Xianghua. She figured that
Kilik could take care of himself, but if the wind priestess were
disturbed now, it would not entirely be good in any way. They
would have to defend their positions to the last. With that in
mind, the grin dissipated into a determined expression as she
rushed forward.

And as she expected, the demonized corpse charged as well.

The two blades met in the middle, Mi-na shifting her blade from a polearm 
into a broadsword while approaching. With more practice, she was able
to shift her weapon&#39;s form on the fly, though she could not yet control
the Flames of Passion without going completely mad in the process. Still,
she had used the weapon&#39;s ability quite well as she ducked underneath
the attacker&#39;s swift stroke, cutting through his midsection after
doing so.

The blade passed cleanly through the decayed bones, and the sheer
heat from the steel burned the body clean away. Of course, the massive
charge of demons came from her side as well, but instead of panicing,
she grinned again. &quot;Ah, well... can&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you!&quot; She
reeled back for a moment, gripping the hilt of the Chinese weapon
tightly before thrusting forward.

The weapon exploded in a bright crimson light as it shifted form, 
turning her lunge into a long-range attack. Two feet turned to six
as the grip lengthened into a rod and the blade shifted into a much
wider and heavier variant. The first attacker was hit dead on by
the blade, punched clean through by her attack. In mere moments,
his body was ash as well. As she retreated her weapon, they
were almost upon her.

The grin widened. &quot;That&#39;s right, come on!&quot;

Within seconds, the full force of the battle came down on them...
_________________________________________________________________________

The woman within the treetops narrowed her eyes, cursing to herself.
This was not entirely going to be pretty if it continued, no matter
how potent the blade was or how skilled the wielder. She had to intervene
soemtime. But still... it was rather impressive. Each handled their first
few attackers qutie well, though it was mostly easy pickings. This
force had strength in numbers, and as such had an advantage.

Still, no matter how much of an advantage they had, it would not be
enough without a clear head. Being posessed, as well as being dead, were
not exactly the requirements for being of a sound mind. Thus, they were
mowed down like wheat... the man with the rod was holding his own
quite well, his wide, sweeping strikes debilitating his targets. The
attacks to the head and chest outright killed them. And with each strike,
energy was being sapped from them. The sheer malevolence that they had
been posessed with was being drained from them with every blow.

The woman with the double-edged sword was most definitely on a roll
as she leapt and danced her way through her section of the horde,
kicking heads off and slitting throats. Each opponent she cut through was
purified instantly, their tainted bodies disintegrating in bursts of light 
within a heartbeat. She was not the one that needed watching.

As for Mi-na... well, the woman was certainly impressed with what
transpired on her end. She almost heard a laugh as the Korean turned
and cut artfully, her blade mowing through scores of the demonic
army as if they were nothing more than tall grass to be shaved. The
blade seemed to exhume a heat of its own, though nothing sacred
like the double-edged sword. Still, the flames did their work quite well
as the posessed bodies turned to nothing more than ash. The ninja
was quite impressed by the fact that with every attack made by the
brown-haired fighter, she could sense the decrease of the evil aura.

(She is actually slaying them, body and soul... impressive.)

But she turned her attention to the girl in the center of all this.
She was too deep in her ecstacy to notice anything else. Whatever entity
was speaking to her at the moment, all the ninja knew was that it was
involved with the wind.

No... not involved. It *was* the wind. She was speaking to it, or
something that rode upon it. Indeed, the wind was the carrier of messages 
from the spiritual plane... perhaps she could use it to her advantage.
But that was a smaller part of a bigger picture. If she were knocked out
of her trance- even killed- Her soul would be torn forcefully from her
body. The girl would be lost entirely.

As she watched, she noticed that the few that had not lost themselves
in the battle had noticed the girl&#39;s inaction. (All right... *now* it&#39;s
time for me to act.) Withdrawing several kunai from her left side and
waited for a clear shot... before tossing them downward with a flick of
her wrist. The blades shone with a blue light as they approached,
straight as arrows. As she had expected, those that were within the
range of her attack were pierced...

And then something unexpected happened.

The ninja smiled as the creatures exploded, the blue lights expanding
outward slightly before fading. The ones nearby were dissolved along
with them, thus effectively ending the threat. She then noticed that a 
few of them were in the trees, aiming towards the warriors with
arrows nocked and ready.

The woman performed the same technique on them all, forcing them to 
detonate one by one without even noticing she was there. Within 
moments, the battle had taken a turn towards the direction of victory.
However, it would not be that way for long. There were plenty of dead
here, and they would replenish their numbers soon enough.

It was time to go, for all of them.

The woman raced toward Hoko Temple, leaving the fighters below to
question what had happened and who had aided them. A few would know,
some would not. And yet, they would still need time to reach the
inner sanctum. She would make it before they did.

She had to... not even these four, who were so skilled, had a
chance against Toki.

It had to be her.
_________________________________________________________________________

Talim&#39;s eyes opened slowly, almost sleepily. When her vision cleared,
she saw discarded weapons and smelled the remaining ashes of corpses.
Sneezing a bit, she spread her hands outward, urging the winds she had
spoken with to clear the smell away. She stood and looked towards the
sky, smiling warmly. &quot;I thank you. You will be free soon enough.&quot;

She turned towards her three companions, a more serious expression
on her face. &quot;We don&#39;t have much time- I can feel the evil gathering
for another attack. I know where it is, but we have to move fast
before they move again.&quot; They all nodded and ran towards the same
directon that the woman had taken, with Talim leading the way.

Soon enough, however, Mi-na was leading the pack again. She knew
this route- it was the one she had stumbled upon as she traveled through
Japan on her second journey for the Soul Edge. That journey was a misison
to destroy it as well. In any case, the stone steps soon greeted them,
and a nauseating aura of corruption washed over them, making their
bodies shudder in rejection as they took the stairs in leaps and bounds.

As they did so, Talim spoke to them, explaining what she had gathered
from the winds, as well as why she had not fought back- snapped out of
her trance as soon as she felt the rising tension in the air. &quot;I trusted
you all to keep me safe so I could get what you needed. And as you can
see-&quot; her sentence slipped off as she smiled happily.

Mi-na and Xianghua nodded. It was a good choice, all things considered.
They had gotten the exact location because of her actions, and could 
head towards the shards with a much faster pace. However, one intriguing
thing was mentioned. &quot;Also, I could feel someone else. Not dangerous-
she was here to help, I think. I believe she was protecting me...&quot;

The Seong prodigy smiled. They hadn&#39;t even noticed, but Talim had.
She knew of only one who would offer assistance in such a way that
no one could notice her. The techniques were subtle, but she knew who
it was that helped. The name, she would not say for now, but it was
certain that she was either ahead, behind, or somewhere near the
four of them.

(I guess she&#39;s got business here as well. Good- we could use all the
help we can get.)

&quot;Come on- we&#39;re almost there!&quot;
_________________________________________________________________________

At the battleground, a flock of black birds with red eyes were quickly
within the area. A girl wearing green and purple had a wide grin on her
face as she tasted the air, taking a deep breath. &quot;I love the smell of
dead people in the morning. It means that there are souls to be had!&quot;
She raised her weapon and began calling out to the tainted energies that
she knew were there...

And the air itself began to grow heavy as lights appeared from every 
tree and blade of grass; every inch of the ground for a good twenty
feet. The girl&#39;s expression was one of sheer bliss as the evil seeped
into every part of her body. It was sheer madness... and she reveled
in it. Voices filled her head- the souls wanted death. They wished for
the destruction of everything that lived.

She laughed merrily; long, loud, and entirely out of her mind. &quot;Yes, 
that&#39;s the spirit! I&#39;ll give you a blood bath to remember! Just you wait 
until you  all meet my master... I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll all get along just fine.&quot;
With that, the flock of birds rose up as she leapt to the tree tops,
following the ones that she knew had passed this way towards the evil
underground sanctum.

To Be Continued...

And thus, a clash has been set!

It&#39;s about to go down *hard* in the next chapter- I certainly hope you&#39;re
as pumped as I am for it! This is definitely one of the best setups
I&#39;ve ever had since... well, I can&#39;t remember, but this is definitely
the start of an excellent fight. As for the luv-luv... I&#39;m not even
telling you when it&#39;s going to happen.

The tension will build to the breaking point as the Kyoto arc continues, 
next time on S.O.E.!

For now, see you guys later. Remember, flames will be used for the
victory barbecue. Constructive criticism only. Post in the thread
and tell me what you think.</pre>
