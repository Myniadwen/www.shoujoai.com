The pirates that continuously raided China were more than a nuiscance. 
They were a constant threat and a grave issue for the emperor, who was 
quickly running out of ideas for the defense of his country. In a 
desperate last attempt to salvage his country, he called forth many 
warriors, including his own personal guard, to find the Soul Edge. But 
even his guards failed, thus ending Chai Xianghua&#39;s role as their 
captain. Now, with civil war approaching and China&#39;s resources running 
dry, hope seemed lost. 

But hope tends to come from the most unusual and unexpected sources... 
____________________________________________________________ 

Mina and Xian were at the inn once again, and were preparing to leave 
for thier next destination. As they packed what clothes they had, Mina 
was silent. But Xian on the other hand had much to say. &quot;This is gonna 
be great! Just like four years ago, We&#39;ll go adventuring and eat all 
sorts of food, just like we used to. And of course, we&#39;ll have lots of 
fun at night too, if you know what I mean!&quot; Mina just nodded, and 
continued packing. The former captain however, noticed Mina&#39;s silence. 
&quot;You do wanna have fun, right?&quot; 

Mina nodded. &quot;Well, say something about it! Don&#39;t leave me high and dry 
like that.&quot; &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said with a smile. &quot;I&#39;m just really deep in 
thought right now.&quot; &quot;I see... What&#39;re you thinking about?&quot; Mina was 
mute. &quot;Oh, come on, tell me! If there&#39;s something wrong, then I want to 
help!&quot; Mina shook her head. &quot;Nothing&#39;s wrong. It&#39;s just that, since 
we&#39;re not supposed to keep secrets from each other, I&#39;ve been wanting to 
tell you something. But I&#39;m not so sure that I want to.&quot; &quot;Oh, is that 
so? Well you helped me out of that during the competition; I guess it&#39;s 
my turn to help you.&quot; &quot;Can&#39;t you already tell what&#39;s wrong with me? We 
are, after all, bound to each other.&quot; 

Xian shrugged at this and replied with, &quot;I think that only works when 
one of us is in pain or in danger. When one is feeling sorrow inside, 
the other is in bodily pain. When one of us is afraid, the other is as 
well. Y&#39;know, when bad stuff like that happens. But you&#39;re neither. 
You&#39;ve gotta tell me what&#39;s wrong, or I can&#39;t help you.&quot; The korean 
woman nodded. &quot;Yeah, I suppose so. But I still don&#39;t feel like telling 
you.&quot; Xian nodded. &quot;I see. Well, that&#39;s okay. I won&#39;t pry.&quot; 

Mina nodded and said, &quot;Thanks. I&#39;d appreciate it.&quot; Xian nodded and said, 
&quot;I guess I&#39;ll ask later. But I wanna help, just the same. So let me give 
you this.&quot; She leaned toward Mina and kissed her gently on the lips. 
This took her friend somewhat by surprise, but it certainly did make her 
feel better. Mina closed her eyes, hoping for the kiss to continue, but 
she felt nothing. When she opened them, she found that Xian was staring 
at her. &quot;What, is there something on my face?&quot;
____________________________________________________________ 

But suddenly, why her friend was looking at her didn&#39;t matter. Something 
compelled her to keep looking. The brown eyes seemed to call to her, 
inviting her into their warmth. Mina sat there, transfixed by the 
beautiful gaze of Xianghua. She was starting to become light-headed, and 
no longer heard her inner voice, which was screaming at her that she was 
being put under hypnosis. But Xianghua&#39;s will completely overpowered 
hers, and Mina was helpless. She was still aware of her surroundings and 
her senses, but the room didn&#39;t seem to matter anymore. 

A voice from within her said, (Don&#39;t freak out. I&#39;ll let you have your 
say in a while. I just want to borrow her for a second.) Mina&#39;s own 
inner voice replied with, (This is no way to find out a secret. It&#39;s 
better to let her say it on her own.) (Yeah, and all the while, the 
problem will slowly eat away at her. I don&#39;t really have a choice on the 
matter. I&#39;m sorry.) Mina&#39;s soul seemed to relent. (She&#39;s yours. Just 
don&#39;t take this too far. Now, speak as you normally would.) 

However, Mina didn&#39;t hear this dialogue. She was still dazed by her 
friend&#39;s eyes. Even her spiritual sensitivity was dulled by Xian&#39;s will. 
She heard Xian&#39;s voice and listened as if there were no other voice in 
the world. &quot;You still want me to help, right?&quot; &quot;With what?&quot; Xian sighed 
and said, &quot;Your problem, silly.&quot; Mina was somewhat confused. &quot;I had a 
problem?&quot; &quot;Yeah, you did.&quot; It cretainly sounded like she did, according 
to Xian. &quot;I guess so.&quot; Xian nodded. &quot;All right, then. Tell me what it 
is.&quot; Mina said, almost immediately, &quot;It&#39;s about that thing where I told 
you that I snuck out. Actually... I didn&#39;t.&quot; 

If Xianghua was surprised, she didn&#39;t show it. &quot;Really? Then what 
happened?&quot; &quot;Well, I was looking for one of my father&#39;s students, Hong 
Yunsung. He left with White Storm, one of my family&#39;s treasure swords. 
Normally, I wouldn&#39;t care; but I think I talked him into leaving in the 
first place by just giving him the sword.&quot; Xian was all the more 
interested in this story, for if it was a treasure sword, like Scarlet 
Thunder was, then it was potentially a living weapon, like the others in 
their possesion. &quot;Please, go on. Tell me about this sword.&quot;
____________________________________________________________ 

After searching around for a while, the inn was exactly where she 
thought it would be- in the last place she would think to look. As she 
neared the building however, she was now faced with the hard part. (How 
do I approach her? If I do this the wrong way, they will distance 
themselves from me. But if I go too far, I might get into something that 
I&#39;m really not ready for. How do I do this right?) Just then, as if 
irritated with her indecision, her soul spoke out again. 

(This is pointless.) Talim heard the voice and jumped in surprise. She 
thought that she had silenced the voice during the final match of the 
tournament. However, it seemed that she was wrong. &quot;Why are you still 
here? You shouldn&#39;t bother me about this!&quot; (On the contrary; I&#39;m the one 
who bothers you about everything, including the fact that you&#39;re talking 
to yourself.) &quot;That&#39;s ridiculous. Why would it seem like-&quot; Then, she was 
aware of her surroundings. People on the street stared at her as she 
spoke to the air itself. She turned a crimson red as she ducked into the 
inn to avoid further shame. 

(See, I have a use after all.) Talim looked around to see if anyone had 
followed her, then she sat down at a table and tried not to voice her 
thoughts. She closed her eyes and focused on the voice. (What, you&#39;re 
only going to listen? *Sigh* That&#39;s what&#39;s wrong with not having your 
full shaman training- you can&#39;t even speak to your own soul.) There was 
that word again. What did it mean? Was it the part of oneself that told 
of danger and evil? Was it simply a voice that gave advice? Was it the 
wind itself? Or did she just need more sleep? 

(What&#39;s there to think about? They seem to know more about these things 
than you do. Ask them about it, not me. I won&#39;t tell you, because you 
won&#39;t understand it from me. As for that other thing, why don&#39;t you 
listen to me for a change, instead of fighting me? It worked last time.) 
Talim couldn&#39;t hear this anymore. She closed her eyes and focused on 
something else. Soon, the voice faded and she was alone again. 

When she opened her eyes again, she noticed that the inn was strangely 
empty, save for the barkeep, who didn&#39;t bother to look at her. She 
breathed a sigh of relief and leaned back, finally relaxing. Her own 
thoughts would not leave her alone however, and the quiet just made 
things worse. She thought about what the mysterious voice said before 
she banished it to the back of her mind. She did feel a sort of inner 
peace when she embraced the woman in red that day. But something more 
was going on. 

Sirens went off in her mind that day, telling her that this was not 
right; that it wasn&#39;t acceptable to society, and more importantly, to 
her god, for this thing to happen. But her body fought reason, as if it 
were controlled by something else. Something deeper within her being 
enjoyed this contact, as if it had been waiting for it for some time. 
Sure, her mother did this simple act with her every day, but this was 
different. She couldn&#39;t explain it at the time, for there were no words 
that fit the sensation. 

Talim was confused that day. She hated it when the forces within her 
clashed like that; she wanted the inner peace she had before, while she 
was still in her village. But it was gone now. The balance between body 
and mind had been shattered with this new factor, called the spirit. She 
knew nothing about it, for she wasn&#39;t that far in her shaman&#39;s training. 
So the logical awnser was to ask someone about it. The woman in red 
knew... but she was afraid to ask her. She had even forgotten her name, 
which was an embarrassment in itself. 

But the more she thought about it, the more it made sense. It seemed to 
be the only way at the time. Besides, two questions would be awnsered at 
once, something that was rare in these times. Somehow, she knew that 
this opportunity would not show itself again. With this in mind, she 
rose from her chair and walked up to the barkeep. &quot;Excuse me.&quot; The 
barkeep had his back turned to her, but heard her nonetheless. &quot;Yeah, 
what is it?&quot; &quot;Did a woman in red come through here with her friend?&quot; He 
nodded. &quot;Oh, sure. They&#39;re staying upstairs, first room to your right.&quot; 
Talim nodded her thanks and went to the room, with her curiousity as the 
only wall against her fears.
____________________________________________________________ 

As Mina finished her story, Xiahghua nodded. It certainly made sense to 
chase after your family&#39;s keepsake. Her sword, the Krita-Yuga, belonged 
to her mother before it passed itno her possesion. If something happened 
to it, she wouldn&#39;t stop until it was found. But there was still one 
thing that puzzled her. &quot;Uh, Mina, why didn&#39;t you tell me this in the 
first place?&quot; 

Mina blushed as the words fell out on their own: &quot;I didn&#39;t want you to 
be disappointed with me. Y&#39;know, actually asking my father for 
permission, not running from home this time- things like that. I guess 
that I might have given you an impression of a tomboy, a rebel. And I 
remember you telling me that was the part of me that you liked the most. 
But... I guess that&#39;s no excuse for lying to you, huh? I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 

After staring at Mina for a full ten seconds, Xian laughed. &quot;W-what? 
What&#39;s so funny?&quot; She looked toward Mina, and when she could catch her 
breath, said, &quot;That&#39;s it? That&#39;s the reason you told me that story?&quot; 
&quot;Yeah... what of it?&quot; After drying the tears from her eyes, Xianghua 
explained. &quot;It&#39;s funny because that&#39;s the exact same reason I lied to 
the Emperor- I didn&#39;t want him to be disappointed. Sure, it was still a 
loss, but the alternative would have been worse. When you say it though, 
it sounds so childish. No offense, of course.&quot; 

&quot;None taken. I know my faults now. Tell you what- from now on, no more 
secrets between us. Agreed?&quot; &quot;You mean, even if I told you that...&quot; 
Mina&#39;s eyes widened in shock by what was whispered into her ear. &quot;Are 
you SERIOUS?&quot; Xian doubled over in laughter at Mina&#39;s reaction. &quot;Heck 
no! I always catch you off guard like that!&quot; Mina pouted in mock anger 
and said jokingly, &quot;That&#39;s not very nice, you know.&quot; 

Even amongst the laughter, Xian could hear the floorboards in the 
hallway creaking. someone was headed toward their room. When the faint 
noises stopped in front of their door, she heard nothing else. (So, you 
wanna know what&#39;s in this room, huh? Fine.) Xian walked over to the 
door, speaking to Mina as she did so. &quot;But enough of this. It seems that 
we have a visitor.&quot; Suddenly, she yanked the door open, sending Talim 
tumbling head over heels to the floor. 

&quot;My, you seem to follow us everywhere, don&#39;t you?&quot;
______________________________________________________________ 

Talim let out a yelp as she fell to the floor, head over heels. As she 
rubbed the back of her head, she felt like the room was falling around 
her, and a piece of the celing just happened to fall on her head. (Yeah, 
way to make an impression. You could&#39;ve just knocked...) 

&quot;I&#39;m betting that really hurt. Are you okay?&quot; Talim looked up at 
Xianghua with a slight irritation. &quot;Well, what do you think? You&#39;re the 
one who opened the door, just when it was getting good!&quot; Then, she 
corrected herself. &quot;I-I mean, I&#39;m sorry for eavesdropping like that. I 
shouldn&#39;t have-&quot; Then, as she looked toward Mina, who was trying to 
supress a laugh, the floor fell out from under her. 

As she cast her gaze at the floor again, her cheeks turned a deep 
crimson. (T-this again! What is it about her?) &quot;F-f-forgive...&quot; Mina 
shook her head and smiled as she said, &quot;Forget about it. Besides, I 
thought that scene was kinda cute. Especially when you fell on the 
floor.&quot; As the blush passed away from her cheeks, Mina walked over to 
her and extended her hand, right in front of her face. &quot;I&#39;m sure that 
the floor is uncomfortable for you. Here, sit with me.&quot; 

As she took her hand, she noticed that it was delicate, and seemed 
unscarred by battle. But as she was hauled from the floor, she almost 
took flight. &quot;Whoa!&quot; Mina was strong, though her features were slender, 
and seemingly easy to break. Mina steadied Talim, laughing lightly as 
she did so. &quot;Sorry, I forget how strong I am sometimes.&quot; After dusting 
herself off, Talim sat on the bed and attempted to find the words to 
begin asking her question. 

(What are you afraid of? Just ask!) That voice again. But this time, she 
thought it better to listen- she didn&#39;t really have the words to ask her 
question. (I can&#39;t find the words.) (Then let me say it for you.) (I&#39;d 
like to, but how?) Her inner voice sighed and said, (Just repeat after 
me.) No other voice was heard but Talim&#39;s, however. Her shaky, somewhat 
hesitant voice, managed to ask: &quot;I&#39;m curious... about something that has 
been happening to me. I came to ask you about it.&quot; 

The room went silent as Mina and Xian listened, the sound of Talim&#39;s 
deep breathing the only thing passing through the air. When she finally 
spoke, her voice was sure, and she spoke with honest curiousity. &quot;See, 
there&#39;s this voice inside my head- whispering things to me that I&#39;ve 
never heard before. And yet, the voice is the same one that I&#39;ve always 
heard all my life.&quot; 

Though she did not hear the voice anymore, she continued on, explaining 
about what she actually did. &quot;The people of my village have been blessed 
by the Goddess of Wind for some time now. But they are not able to speak 
to her, because those who have gone through the shaman&#39;s training have 
either died, or gone insane.&quot; While Mina listened intenly, Xian was 
utterly confused. &quot;Shaman&#39;s training? What&#39;s a shaman?&quot; 

Talim was about to explain when Mina suddenly came out of her silence. 
&quot;Shamans are people who train thier bodies, minds, and souls, just for 
the purpose of becoming mediators between our world and theirs.&quot; 
&quot;Mediators? So all they can do is speak to spirits?&quot; Mina shook her 
head, and continued with, &quot;When times call for it, they use their bodies 
as vessels, meaning that the spirits take control over them and speak 
through them.&quot; 

Xian shuddered when she had a mental picture of the situation. &quot;That&#39;s 
creepy. I wouldn&#39;t want to be like that.&quot; Mina shook her head and 
continued with, &quot;No, it&#39;s not so bad. I think that it&#39;s a good way to 
calm restless spirits and take care of demons without a weapon.&quot; Xian 
looked at her friend with concern. &quot;You can&#39;t be serious. Willingly let 
a demon take control of you? No way.&quot; 

Talim spoke up with, &quot;But it is possible to dispel demons in that way, 
though that isn&#39;t my purpose. My purpose is to read the winds, focusing 
both body and mind in order to do so. I can hear voices on the winds, 
even from the most distant of cities. And they all echo in my head, just 
like this voice, though they are at a whisper. But this new voice is 
ever present, even when I&#39;m not concentrating. It frustrates me, and I 
either want to learn how to speak with this voice, or get rid of it all 
together.&quot;
____________________________________________________________________ 

Three men stomped into the tavern, making a scene as they did so. One of 
them, the tallest and most burly of the three, looked around with 
disgust. &quot;Hmph. This old rag is supposed to have some good food? Doesn&#39;t 
look like it.&quot; Another one, thin-framed and slightly pale, added, &quot;Yeah, 
it doesn&#39;t seem to be the place for good eatin&#39;. There aren&#39;t any women 
here, either. Are you sure this is the place?&quot; 

The third, who was the mid-point between the two, nodded. &quot;I&#39;m positive. 
What, you don&#39;t trust my information? Just find a place to sit- I&#39;ll get 
the head chef out here.&quot; As he did so, the others did as he said, 
sulking as they sat at a table. &quot;Why the hell do we have to follow HIS 
orders? He&#39;s nothing but a kid, compared to us...&quot; The bigger man 
replied with, &quot;The boss plays favorites like this sometimes. It&#39;s not 
fair, but you&#39;ve gotta put up with it.&quot; 

The man who had left for the kitchen shook his head in shame. He was to 
escort these two idiots around the city, trying to gather information. 
Trying was an understatement; Info. was impossible to find, since they 
were members of the pirate clan that was hated throughout the Ming 
empire. But they were misunderstood and misrepresented, and all because 
of muscle heads like them. 

So he went to the one place where he knew that he&#39;d be accepted. Of 
course, with those two here, It&#39;d be difficult. &quot;Hey, old man! I&#39;m here 
again.&quot; The &#39;old man&#39; turned to face the young one, and smiled as he did 
so. &quot;So, are you here for the food? Or something else?&quot; &quot;You know me far 
too well. Yes, I&#39;m here on business again, but it&#39;s the last time.&quot; 
&quot;That&#39;s a relief.&quot; Then, lowering his voice, &quot;Are those two here as 
well?&quot; &quot;Sorry, but yes.&quot; 

After seeing the frightened look on the head chef&#39;s face, he shook his 
head. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m in charge of them. Please, get them 
something to eat, will you? I think they&#39;re getting restless.&quot; The aged, 
but experienced chef nodded, and set himself to work. As he prepared the 
dishes, he made some conversation. &quot;By the way, a few women carrying 
weapons came through here today, asking for a room.&quot; 

The young man perked up. It was important business when the old chef 
spoke while he cooked, for he usually spoke the truth. &quot;Really? One 
doesn&#39;t see much of that these days. Do they come here often?&quot; &quot;Oh yes, 
lots of times. Matter of fact, they were here all week, participating in 
the big tournament.&quot; 

He had heard of the tournament. The Ming emperor was looking for the 
strongest fighters in the land, in order to draw fresh talent for his 
Personal Guard. However, what really intrested him was this year&#39;s 
champion, who not only beat many of the strongest in the competition 
handily, but also turned down the invitation into the personal guard. 

Instead, she picked a kwandao by the name of Hyup Do, and left without 
her audience with the emperor. 

A woman wearing red, wielding a crimson zanbatou... Those were almost 
impossible to wield in battle, much less in competition. But she carried 
it around as if it were a feather, and swung it like a graphite rod. Her 
style resembles Ling Sheng Su, but she moved so quickly, no one could 
tell. Perhaps this was the one? 

&quot;Interesting. Which room are they in?&quot; 
____________________________________________________________________ 

&quot;So, what you&#39;re saying is that all this time, I&#39;ve been thinking 
unneccessary thoughts, and I need to quiet my mind?&quot; After shaking her 
head, Mina replied, &quot;Yes, but not all thoughts are meaningless. It&#39;s 
just natural for people to let their minds wander. But if you just 
concentrate on your breathing, and nothing else, those idle thoughts 
will vanish away. Then, you&#39;ll be able to hear the voice within you.&quot; 

Mina had spent the past few minutes explaining everything she had 
learned about the human spirit- what it was, why it was there, and how 
to use it. She told Talim that it had a voice, a mind, felt joy and 
pain, and was unique to every person. 

&quot;What I don&#39;t get is, why I feel what you&#39;re feeling right now?&quot; Mina 
was waiting for this part. &quot;Well, it depends on what you feel. Please, 
explain.&quot; Talim knew that she was heading down an uncertain path, but 
she decided to keep walking forward. And so, after a deep breath, she 
explained what went through her being. &quot;I feel peaceful. I&#39;ve felt that 
way ever since we started talking. I guess it&#39;s because I&#39;m comfortable 
around you now, though I can&#39;t say why. And back at the tournament, I 
felt so strong, even when you yelled at me.&quot; 

Mina scratched the back of her head and sweatdropped. &quot;Er... sorry about 
that. I just get carried away about those kind of things.&quot; &quot;What kind of 
things?&quot; &quot;Well... when I&#39;m in a fight, I want my opponent to be at their 
best, no matter what they wnet through earlier. If something distracts 
them while they fight, they&#39;ll end up getting hurt, and I didn&#39;t want to 
hurt you.&quot; 

Talim&#39;s cheeks reddened slightly at this, but she didn&#39;t seem to notice. 
&quot;I knew you were trying to help me. Somehow, I just knew it.&quot; &quot;No 
problem. When you&#39;re friends with someone, it&#39;s only natural to help 
out, right?&quot; &quot;Right. Thank you. So, can I try it now?&quot; 

&quot;Try what? Oh, that... Sure. But don&#39;t freak out when you hear it, 
okay?&quot; Talim nodded. &quot;All right. Now just relax.&quot; Talim sat on the edge 
of the bed, back straight and hands in her lap with the palms up. She 
closed her eyes and began taking slow, deep breaths. Mina sat behind her 
and spoke into her ear, not at a whisper, but not in a normal tone 
either. Nor was it in a commanding tone- rather a suggestive one. 

&quot;Focus on your breathing, and nothing else. Your breathing is the the 
ocean waves, your body, light as air, your mind, a shining crystal...&quot; 
At once, Talim&#39;s breathing slowed even further, and began to sound very 
much like the sea. Her shoulders, which were tense, though Mina told her 
to relax, finally relaxed. Her heart rate began to drop, little by 
little. Her head drooped slightly, almost as if she were falling asleep. 

So deep and intense was her concentration, even Mina&#39;s voice was fading. 
Then, there was utter, peaceful silence, as if she were in a void. But 
this wan&#39;t just a void- it was filled with something. Though she could 
neither see, nor hear anything, another sense could feel a prescence. It 
was an overwhelming sensation, an abundance of pure energy, just waiting 
to be used. She began to feel light headed as the energy passed through 
her. 

Then, she heard something. It was faint at first, so she focused on the 
voice. Immediately, the whisper was a yell! (YOU DON&#39;T HAVE TO 
CONCENTRATE THAT HARD, YOU KNOW!) Talim eased her focus, and the voice 
was normal, at least to her. (Well, now that we&#39;ve cleared that gap, can 
you see me?) Talim strained her eyes, but could not see anything in the 
inky darkness. 

(No, much less anything else.) (Good. Then you understand.) (Understand 
what? What&#39;re you getting at?) (What, her explination wasn&#39;t clear 
enough? I certainly understood.) Talim shook her head and said, (Yeah, I 
heard her, and I understood her. The one I don&#39;t understand is you, the 
way you speak in riddles and such.) (A riddle, is it? *sigh* But I 
suppose that you&#39;re trying this for the first time, so it behooves me to 
explain. The reason you can&#39;t see me is that you haven&#39;t given me a body 
yet.) 

(&#39;Given you a body&#39;? You&#39;re talking nonsense.) (I&#39;m not. You don&#39;t see 
me because you haven&#39;t created me yet. You only hear my voice.) (Create 
you? Like giving birth, or something?) A laugh, then, (Not in the 
physical sense.) Talim scratched her head, confused to no end at these 
puzzles. (Can&#39;t you explain it any further?) (It is difficult to explain 
it to one so young as yourself. It is better if you do it yourself, with 
my help.) 

Talim shrugged, thinking that this was good enough for now. (Okay. where 
do we start?) (You are surrounded by a void of energy. A place where 
anything can be created. But this energy is idle and formless. This is 
where your mind comes in.) (My mind?) (Yes. Your mind channels this 
energy, turning it into anything you desire. But this energy is limited 
at first, and you will tire out easily, in both your physical body and 
within this place.) 

Talim nodded, and tried to sum it up. (So, I can use this for anything I 
want, but I&#39;ll be too worn out to do anything else. Gotcha.) (If that&#39;s 
what you think, then so be it.) (Huh? You mean, I won&#39;t?) (That is up to 
you. A rock dropped into a pond only causes a ripple. But one day, that 
ripple becomes a wave.) 

Talim knew that saying. It was ususally said in her village. No matter 
how small the beginning, the end result will always be greater than 
expected. Then, she realized it. She didn&#39;t have to use everything- just 
enough. (I understand now.) (Good, then we can skip the rest of the 
explination. Now, I&#39;m waiting patiently.) 

Talim didn&#39;t do much of anything, save for light concentration. Small, 
bright points of light began to appear, formed only from her focused 
mind, and began to gather around her. Though the lights pierced the 
void, Talim&#39;s eyes were, strangely enough, unharmed. Without moving a 
hand or closing an eye, she began to shape the energy according to the 
image in her mind. 

After a few moments, a young woman stood, or rather floated, in front of 
her, eyes closed. Her platinum hair was not tied, but flowed freely 
through the air. her naked body was pale, almost white, but it was part 
of the image. Other than these otherworldly features, the persona looked 
and sounded exactly like Talim. 

Stunned by what she had done, she could say nothing. She had, in a way, 
created a life using her will alone. This was something that only the 
divine were able to do, and yet, she did so. Though she knew that this 
was only an image, she was still afraid. And yet... Yet the girl she had 
created looked so beautiful. Too beautiful to be real, though she was 
here in front of her. 

As the girl opened her deep, brown eyes, Talim gasped in amazement. 
(Even her eyes are beautiful.) (Of course they are. They&#39;re your eyes, 
aren&#39;t they?) (What? What&#39;s that supposed to mean?) (You must understand 
that you and I are the same person. I share your thoughts.) (Really? 
Then I should watch what I think around here.) (Oh, you don&#39;t have to 
worry. There&#39;s nothing here that I haven&#39;t seen before. I&#39;m especially 
interested in that Mina that you&#39;re with.) 

Talim&#39;s face was burning at this comment. (What&#39;re you talking about?) 
(Oh, come on. She&#39;s cute, admit it.&quot; (Y-you shouldn&#39;t-) (Say such 
things? Even if it&#39;s the truth?) Talim gasped as reality stepped in. 
Yes, she did think Mina was cute. There was no hiding it. (You&#39;re right. 
She&#39;s cute.) (Yes... She&#39;s a part of me too, you know. A part of her 
soul is in this place, and it binds you to her.) 

(Binds me? So that&#39;s why I can feel what she feels.) (That&#39;s right. So 
you do know that she loves me, right?) (What? She loves YOU?) With a 
light, airy laugh, she explained. (Oh, don&#39;t get me wrong- she loves 
both of us. She just sees your inner being, me, and loves you even more 
for it. But that&#39;s just as long as I am pure, and without stain.) 
(Hmm... I can understand that.) (That&#39;s good. But the question is, can 
you accept those feelings, whether you feel the same or not?) 

Talim was silent at this. A woman in love with another woman, and not 
just as friends... it was awkward, and a little unsettling. But Mina 
didn&#39;t just love her body, but everything- what she was, what she did, 
and how she did it. All because she could see her soul. 

(Yes... yes I can. And I think I&#39;m starting to feel the same.)
________________________________________________________________ 

A shapely, dusky-eyed waitress walked by, casually minding her business. 
She headed toward the two men who obviously looked like more trouble 
than they were worth,and simply smiled at them, asking if they wanted 
anything to drink. As the thinner and more sinister looking of the two 
looked up at her with a predatory grin, he simply said- &quot;How about you, 
miss? You seem refreshing enough, no?&quot; She smirked at him and replied 
with &quot;Sorry, but I&#39;m not on the drink list today.&quot; 

The two of them looked at each other, then looked at her with knowing 
smiles and feral looks in their eyes as she walked on.. Perhaps they 
would have some fun after all. But which one would go first? The burly 
one simply asked- &quot;Flip for it?&quot; The skinny man nodded. &quot;Flip for it.&quot; 
He pulled out a coin, showing it to him so that his overly bulky partner 
would see that it was not double sided. Then, he casually flicked it 
into the air and called heads. 

As the coin hit the table with a &quot;plink&quot;, it bounced once.. twice... 
three times. Then it simply stopped moving all together, landing on 
heads. Again. &quot;Aww, dammit,&quot; the large one cursed under his breath. He 
would never get to have any fun. The taller man simply grinned, seeing 
as luck seemed to be with him almost perpetually. He did not question 
it- it was just there. He nodded and got up from the table as if to 
stretch out. As he sat down again, he watched the room, following her 
every movement and pattern. 

Sure enough, she came by again, and he took the liberty of snatching her 
up in his arms while he stood and slinging her over his shoulder in one 
clean, fluid motion. She squirmed and writhed in his vice grip, her 
blows to his back not helping any. She tried to let out a scream- but 
that just would not do right now. He caught her at a pressure point on 
her neck, pinpointing the one that would knock her unconcious 
immediately and on reaction. As her eyes closed against their will, he 
simply carried her upstairs and past Mina&#39;s room, towards the room at 
the end of the hall. 

His first mistake... for the soul was still alive. And it let out a 
desperate plea for help as she was carried past their room.
_________________________________________________________________ 

The food was just about ready in the kitchen, and the young man who 
allied himself with the local pirates had what he needed. Something to 
tell his boss about. The three women who were in the fourth room from 
the stairwell, on the right side of the hallway, were involved heavily 
with Soul Edge. How he got this information without the usual bloodshed 
is a mystery, but he has a way with words about him that few of the 
uncivilized rabble did. 

They knew only how to take and slay- nothing more. But then again, it 
was expected- they knew nothing else. But the young man, who seemed to 
have an air of command and control about him, knew his way around 
without having to draw a blade- unless necessary, of course. He always 
had a 28&quot; wakizashi at the ready, just in case he needed it. And he had 
the feeling that it was about to come into play. 

As he came back himself with the food, he looked at his table and noted 
that where there used to be two, now there was one. And that one looked 
increasingly smug, as if he were waiting for something. He sighed- if it 
were what he was thinking it was, then this would be another bad day... 
He walked over to the table with the food and simply looked at the big 
man sternly. 

&quot;Where&#39;s Fang at?&quot; The man snapped out of his daze and said sheepishly- 
&quot;Oh, he&#39;s just out for some air, that&#39;s all. Not exactly feeling to 
good, y&#39;know?&quot; The young man simply quirked an eyebrow and sighed. He 
didn&#39;t want to know what it was this time, and didn&#39;t care anymore. 
Besides, that was the way things worked around here these days... it was 
sad, but it couldn&#39;t be helped. Then again, something would hopefully go 
wrong this time...
__________________________________________________________________ 

Talim&#39;s.. well, one would call it a &quot;sister&quot; of sorts- suddenly became 
alert. Eyes were sharp and focused; ears were tuned to everything around 
her; smells and touches were heightened... and she heard something. A 
voice that rang clear in this darkness. 

&quot;Somebody help me!!&quot; 

A woman... and she was close. Very much so. Talim&#39;s soul nodded towards 
her. (There&#39;s not much time. Someone needs help.) The young sybill 
nodded. (I&#39;ll go to her, then.) Her spirit cautioned to her- (The enemy 
is not as fragile as the others. Be careful, and remember to use me if 
you have to.) She was confused again, but a scream blocked out any 
confusion. She simply nodded and rose from the abyss, looking at the 
light above... 

And her eyes snapped open, suddenly aglow with fire and spirit. What 
seemed like an eternity had been mere moments, in fact. Talim cared not. 
She looked towards Mina and Xianghua, and they had the same look in 
theirs. The three of them had heard the despair- the screams and cries 
for help. And all three had weapons at the ready. She nodded to them as 
they rose from the bed and followed the source of the pleas for help. 

As they headed down the hallway, the three women could not help but 
wonder what the matter was, though Mina had a good guess... the voice 
sounded urgent- very much so, as if something was being done without her 
concious knowledge- she was watching herself doing something against her 
very will and soul. Mina was visibly angry at this, and picked up the 
pace, though she still tried to be silent. Xian and Talim felt the 
passionate anger and desire to punish... and they were afraid that it 
may go a little too far. 

As the approached the door, they heard a voice from the other side- a 
man with a serpentile voice that had a tone of arrogance and dominance 
in it. This was the problem... she looked back at the other two and 
nodded. She held up her left hand and slowly started ticking off each 
finger. As soon as her hand had closed into a complete fist, they would 
move...
___________________________________________________________________ 

The man known as Wolf&#39;s Fang was quite pleased with himself. The 
waitress that smelled of orchids was definitely a rare find. He 
considered taking her with him for later use, but why not have a sample 
of something good for himself? The others would have time to &quot;play&quot; 
later- he wanted the prime choice first. 

&quot;Hmm.. It&#39;s almost a shame, really. I&#39;d rather like you to myself.. but 
it&#39;s going to be hard, pulling the others off of you. They haven&#39;t had a 
good woman in a while you see, and will be overly excited on your 
arrival. I may need to lock you away for a while... we still have work 
to do on your country, you know?&quot; 

Enough talk. Time for the fun. 

5... 

He ran a hand over her cheek bones and face, reveling in the soft skin 
and fine lines. 

4... 

Fang ran his hand through her hair, admiring its silken touch... he 
would love a lock of that to remember her by. Sure he would probably 
have to tear it out, just to keep things exciting, but he would remind 
himself to get one. 

3... 

His hands ran down the length of her body, feeling each and every 
feature that nature had given her. And he was impressed, this was 
definitely something to treasure. Or rather, in this case, something to 
steal. He would not share this one with the others, he decided. This one 
was his. He would make sure of it. 

2... 

Feeling that the clothes were a bother, he tore them open, sending 
buttons everywhere and ruining them completely. He cared not- she was 
the goal. He would have to make sure that he got her a new one later... 
but that was later. This was now. 

1... 

He was just about to touch her, simply to feel every part of her. 
Instinct began to take over, and his gentlemanly, though savage ways 
were coming to an end. This would be most satisfying. Or so he thought. 
Then, something happened. 

Boom. The door was kicked open. Splinters flew everywhere as a foot, 
clad with a red shoe, smashed it apart. Three women stood at the 
entranceway, armed to the teeth. Apparently, they were here for one 
thing... a fight. And it would be a painful, bloody one. Wolf smiled. 
&quot;Well well. Here to join the fun, are you? I&#39;d love to oblige, but I&#39;m a 
little busy with this one. But if you&#39;ll wait in line, I&#39;m sure that 
each of you will have a turn.&quot; 

The brown haired, green eyed woman in red smiled. She was not angry... 
not visibly so. She was simply amused at the man&#39;s conduct. He knew no 
fear... that was a bad thing. Fear kept one safe... and he was now in 
danger. Big time. She simply responded with the same tone that he used: 
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sure that you&#39;d like that. But she&#39;s out of your league. Why 
not try me on for size? You won&#39;t regret it...&quot;
_________________________________________________________________ 

&quot;He&#39;s been gone for quite a while now... are you telling me the truth?&quot; 
asked the young man who was evidently getting irritated at the abscence 
of his other partner. The bigger, bulkier man replied with- &quot;I&#39;m tellin&#39; 
ya, he&#39;s not feeling well!&quot; He was sweating bullets- apparently, he was 
cracking under the pressure that was not there. The young 
second-in-command saw this, and shook his head. &quot;You know, the stress of 
a lie will kill you someday. I&#39;m checking upstairs.&quot; 

The big man smacked himself on the forehead, feeling very foolish. Why 
did he have to be so nervous when he was asked questions, even simple 
ones? Of course, when one could not think all that well outside of 
battle, one did not expect others to understand much about anything 
else. He shrugged it off and returned to his meal. 

Meanwhile, the young tactician was heading upstairs, the left hand near 
the grip of his wakizashi. There was something amiss here... he could 
not have just left for a quick little satisfaction and not have returned 
by now. As he searched the hall, he heard the clash of steel upon steel 
and broke into a run. Just as he thought- Fang had gotten himself into 
trouble again. And this time, he would not help. It was a fitting 
punishment for someone who was as reckless and slightly insane as Wolf&#39;s 
Fang. He found the door already open though, and he saw some things that 
were expected, and some that were not. 

The man&#39;s long, sharp claws were in a lock with the rod of a crimson red 
zanbatoh, with two other women watching with anxious looks and drawn 
weapons, as if ready to jump into the fray to help. He smirked and 
leaned against the doorway and watched the struggle. He almost laughed 
at the irony- he was about to violate a woman, and here he was about to 
get violated by one. And a very skilled one at that- he knew it. He just 
had to watch and see.
_________________________________________________________________ 

Mina grinned wildly. She could feel the power flowing through her as she 
struggled against the other man&#39;s weapon. Anger was forgotten for a 
brief instant as she shoved him back towards the window, hoping to get a 
better position in this cramped space. Such a weapon as a zanbatoh could 
not be useful in this situation, and she needed him as far out of the 
inn as possible for a good chance. As her eyes took a quick glance over 
to the bed, she felt a twinge of pity for the woman. She was beautiful- 
and that was both blessing and curse to her. 

Mina&#39;s anger came back. &quot;I can&#39;t let you get away with this. Your ass is 
mine.&quot; Fang grinned at this, the slight insanity in his eyes. 
&quot;Kehehehehe... who&#39;s to stop us from burning this place if you try? You 
do know that this town... this country is ours? We come and go as we 
please. If you value the lives of those that pass through this hovel, 
then let me have her.&quot; 

Mina reacted with a surprising speed and agility. Before his sentence 
was finished, she lunged at the thin, wicked pirate with a kick to his 
gut, followed by a sharp hit in said area with the back of her weapon. 
He was sent flying through the window behind him, and slammed on the 
street below, knocking the wind out of him. As Mina followed him out of 
the window, she lifted the Scarlet Thunder high above her head, 
preparing for a strike that would cleave him in two if he did not move. 

It was too obvious. Wolf just did not see the attack until the last 
second. He rolled out of the way, barely avioding being cut in two, and 
lunged with reckless abandon after getting up. As she easily stepped to 
her left and let the attack pass by, slamming the blunt end of her 
weapon into his shoulder and sending him to the floor, she had a good 
look in his eyes. They were full of madness, as if he had been posessed. 
But her weapon showed no signs that he was so, save for his own twisted 
mind. She had to take this one down now, before something happened. Her 
weapon, which was silent until now, agreed wholly. (We must put this man 
to an end before he makes good on his threat.) (I agree. All right then, 
let&#39;s do this!)
_________________________________________________________________ 

Xianghua and Talim were at a loss for words as Mina followed the man out 
of the window. As usual, she took it a little too far. It would&#39;ve been 
enough that he was out of the room, but she had to take the fight to him 
for some reason. The two of them smiled at this, then turned to the man 
who was standing in the doorway. Xian spoke first, smiling sweetly at 
him with her sword slung on her shoulder. 

&quot;I&#39;d love to know why you simply sat there in the shadows, but we have a 
friend to help out. I&#39;d like to warn you that we are not as we seem, and 
if you or your friends try anything, we will come after you with 
everything within us. All three of us.&quot; Talim simply nodded, seeing as 
there was nothing else to be said. The smiles on their faces were offset 
by the determination and disgust in their eyes. Apparently, even Talim 
knew about the pirates in the short time that she was here- the winds 
must have spoken to her about them. 

In any case, they headed towards the window and exited through it to 
join the battle below. The young man shook his head and cursed his luck. 
Fang had once again ruined his chance at regaining some honor today... 
and he would let the scars from their blades be a good lesson. 

As he walked back downstairs however, the same predatory grin, filled 
with a dark intelligence, spread across his face. The older women were 
not willing to cooperate easily, as far as he could tell. But with the 
young one in their possesion, they would have to consent. He just needed 
to know how to get her back to the hideout with both of them in one 
piece. If everything went according to plan, they would be a few steps 
closer to the Soul Edge... and all their wildest dreams would come true.
_________________________________________________________________ 

&quot;Give me BLOOD!!&quot; He struck again and again, his claws lashing out at 
the young warrior. So wild and furious were his attacks that she had to 
defend more than dodge, and was starting to give ground. Then, with a 
satisfied and twisted grin, he thrust both weapons at her stomach, in an 
attempt to gut her completely. An obvious move... but as she blocked the 
strike, holding her weapon horizontally to stop the attack, the Scarlet 
Thunder was ensnared within the long, sharp blades and she knew that she 
had made a mistake. There was only one reaction to this, and he had 
enough sense- or blood lust- to make the decision. Fang heaved upwards, 
tearing her weapon free, and flung it over his head, effectively 
disrming her. 

Her arms were above her head and she was stumbling towards the street... 
Fang rose his weapons for the coup de grace. As they flashed in the 
sunlight, so did his eyes in madness and arrogance. They were within 
inches now, about to tear through... 

&quot;Mina!!&quot; Xianghua ran towards her, almost knowing that it would not be 
enough.. and then the electric sound of steel upon pure, unfathomed 
energy sounded off. &quot;What the hell is this?&quot; Fang cried out, frustrated 
at his ruined chance at bloodletting. Mina said nothing, but simply 
rolled out of the way and stood at the ready. It was the weapon&#39;s 
natural reaction to defend her, even if she did not have it in her 
possesion. But what was she to do now? His madness had a method to it- 
it made him faster and stronger, if a bit reckless. She would not be 
able to reach the weapon. 

But for the moment, they both circled each other, waiting for a chance 
to strike. He had the same insane grin on his face, and was not trying 
all that hard to hold his desire to kill within him- or so his twisted 
grins and short bursts of laughter suggested. She was afraid- her eyes 
showed it. But something within her would have her keep going... it was 
them. The two women that were right behind her, waiting to rush to her 
aid. The two that she was bound to by fate and love. Two of the six that 
were integral to the world&#39;s safety and salvation. And everything became 
clear. She called on those feelings that ran through her, and felt her 
nerve return. 

All the other people in the inn as well as the city itself were 
important. Mina knew that, and didn&#39;t care. All she knew was that she 
had to win... or they would die. If they died, Mina would die from 
within, and with the worst pain ever imagined, until she would beg for a 
physical death in the end. And she would not stand for such a thing. Nor 
would she have the alternative happen, either... she would not have them 
watch her die in front of them. The same scenario would happen to them- 
only a thousand fold. Failure was never an option for her... and now, 
the need for victory was greater than ever. 

With a calm, determined gaze in her eyes, she readied herself for the 
next attack.

- End 

Hey, another good one. Sorry it took so long- I was lazy as hell. 
Anyway, I do hope that it&#39;s to your liking. The end of this fight will 
definitely be in the next chapter, so stick around for a while. Because 
The One has returned. :) As per usual, tell me what you think. Feedback 
is needed for this story to grow! 

- Next Chapter 

When one is using a sword to defend, they must achieve a complete 
victory. One cannot lose a battle in which the lives of others are at 
steak, for their lives are bound to the warrior, if only for a scant few 
moments. But in order to win completely, one must use methods that are 
far beyond the scope of their limits. As the Scarlet Thunder glows a 
crimson red, Mina learns an aspect about mastering her newfound power to 
defend the ones she cares for. </pre>
