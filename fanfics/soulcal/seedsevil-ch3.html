<h1>The Seeds of Evil: Phoenix Rising (part 3 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../soulcal/seedsevil-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Mina had had quite enough.

She had almost literally seen hell itself, and could no longer handle 
the strain of the journey. Everyone in the troupe was drained of their 
strength, and it seemed that the mirrored sash was shattered beyond 
repair. Her friend, who had been fighting tirelessly, was now bleeding 
heavily, and seemed to be at a loss. She herself was slowly being wasted 
away, though she fought tooth and nail to defend the sixteen year old 
guard.

However, something happened. Something that made everything seem better 
again. Her friend&#39;s sword, Krita-Yuga, began to shift and change, the 
steel twisting under its own influence. A radiant, resonating light 
glowed and shined from the blade, as if it were beating back the 
darkness that threatened to swallow them.

As the young woman gripped the hilt, something of an explosion took 
place. Power, sound, light, and fury combined, and filled the void. Even 
Mina was touched the awesome power, and at once, her scrapes and bruises 
were healed, sealed, and erased. Not even a scar was left. Even more 
remarkable was the fact that her beloved zanba-toh had undergone 
repairs, almost as if responding to the light. Before her eyes, it 
repaired itself. Every scrape and cut, every nick and blow it had 
suffered- gone, as if it were newly forged.

In a way, it had been reborn.

With a sudden understanding, the young fighter before her looked at the 
malevolent demon and smiled. The battle was over before it had even 
started, and none of them had known it. Mina stood up quickly, as if 
nothing had even happened, and joined her at her side. Kilik had risen 
as well, muttering an incantation.

The living flame suddenly sprang forth, prepared for more carnage and 
blood, for such was its nature. It did not get very far before being met 
with Mina&#39;s polearm, which was now drawing screams of pain from the 
physical manifesto of the evil swords, when before it had done nothing 
but pass through him. A jagged scar was carved into its chest- the first 
successful hit of the entire bout.

The guard followed with her blade, and an even louder tortured wail 
sounded forth. The two warriors beat the flames back, further and 
further, until it stood at the edge of the pit that led to oblivion. And 
with one final attack from the both of them, he was forced over the 
edge, flames sputtering out of existance.

The battle had been won.. yet Mina still cried. She had seen enough, and 
just wanted to go home.

-Chapter 3: Two Souls Are One
_________________________________________________________________________

It was a lifetime before either of them tried to say anything else. Mina 
was too busy trying to wake up, so Xianghua broke the silence. &quot;I found 
you. Took me a good while, too.&quot; &quot;Your timing...&quot; Mina replied sleepily, 
&quot;is a little off.&quot; &quot;What, you&#39;re not happy to see me?&quot; Mina slowly sat 
up. &quot;No, it&#39;s nothing like that. I&#39;m just a little tired right now.&quot; 
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s been a long day for me, too.&quot; All the while, Xianghua stared 
into Mina&#39;s emerald eyes with a dazed look. &#39;That look in her eyes... 
that&#39;s the way she looked at Kilik...&#39; she also noticed that the 
distance between them was closing. &quot;Hey, uh... how&#39;s Kilik?&quot; A 
displeased look on Xianghua&#39;s face replaced her innocent smile... and 
the floodgates opened.

&quot;He&#39;s not doing well...&quot; &#39;And I have a feeling that it&#39;s not because 
he&#39;s sick!&#39; Mina had to ask. &quot;You kicked his ass, didn&#39;t you?&quot; 
&quot;Royally.&quot; Mina had to contain her laughter at this. &quot;So, you DID feel 
that way about him. I knew it!&quot; &quot;Yeah, but as soon as I told him, he fed 
me this line about his &quot;duty&quot; and other stuff.&quot; &#39;Duty... wait a minute!&#39; 
&quot;Did he mention how childish you were acting?&quot; Xianghua was stunned. 
&quot;Yeah! He did! But you weren&#39;t there, so how could you know?&quot; Mina had 
to stop herself from falling out of the bed. &#39;This is wierd. The same 
thing happened... to BOTH of us? But...&#39; &quot;But I thought that you and him 
were a sure thing?&quot; &quot;Oh, we were. But then, he focused all his energy on 
cleansing himself of his evil. We rarely talked, and when we did, he 
wouldn&#39;t contribute to the conversation! It was almost as if...&quot; &quot;As if 
he were ignoring you.&quot; &quot;Right... huh? Stop that! You&#39;re creepin&#39; me 
out!&quot;

&#39;Our situations are too similar... as if they happened at the same time! 
Wait... did they?&#39; Mina metally shook her head. &#39;No! It takes a long 
time to get from there to here! But still...&#39; &quot;Mina?&quot; she was called out 
of thought. &quot;Huh? Oh, sorry! just thinking about how similar our 
situations are.&quot; &quot;What do you mean?&quot; &quot;My whole family, save for mom, has 
treated me the same way, like a child. They don&#39;t listen, they don&#39;t 
respect me, and they push me around. That means that they don&#39;t really 
care about me. So I left.&quot; &quot;When?&quot; &quot;Uh... Just yesterday.&quot; Xianghua 
laughed. &quot;For what, the third time now?&quot; &quot;Yeah. You&#39;re a really good 
listener.&quot; &quot;Of course. It&#39;s because I love you.&quot;

Mina smiled at this. The years began coming back to her now, more vivid 
than ever. The two of them had done more than simply hold hands... They 
shared air. Warmth. Touches and feelings. Many a time had they shared a 
bed for warmth, only to find themselves in an embrace, pleasantly 
drained of their strength, and yet alive and reborn. She had longed for 
that very touch and embrace, and for four years, it had tortured her.

She needed to remind her of what she felt, before anything else 
happened.

In a now seductive purr that would have seemed uncharacteristic all 
those years ago, she asked... &quot;So did you get any better?&quot; Xianghua 
simply smiled, a now predatory gleam in her eye. &quot;You have no idea...&quot;
_________________________________________________________________________

The night was quiet, and all the town was in bed... yet as with all 
peaceful things, it was short-lived. A voice had been echoing through 
the town... &#39;Feed me... I want more souls... MORE!&#39; At this shout, the 
entire town was on it&#39;s feet. Empowered by the Blade, their hatred for 
each other came to the surface, even over the small, trivial things. The 
moon, now a deep, crimson red, made it worse... and on top of that, 
those who were naturally evil obeyed the call like mindless slaves. The 
new servants began to search for pure, unspoiled souls...
_________________________________________________________________________

Fire and ice met as one pair of lips sought to conquer the other, an 
embrace that was four years in the making. Mina slid her tongue across 
the former captain&#39;s bottom lip, acting as the key to the treasure 
within. Almost on que, Xianghua&#39;s mouth opened slightly, and Mina acted 
without thought or reason, her tongue sliding in to meet her friend&#39;s. 
Mina&#39;s hands, which were sliding over the silk jacket, begged for the 
feel of skin instead, and she wasted no time in sliding her hands 
underneath the jacket, pushing the smaller woman back gently to take it 
off.

Standing there with a grin, Xhanghua allowed herself to be disrobed, 
only to find that Mina was being her tomboyish self again, her eyes 
widening at the look of her body. &quot;Wow... four years can do a lot to a 
gal, huh?&quot; Xian walked over to the brunette, her hips swaying in a 
hypnotic rhythm that spoke volumes. The all-too-short shorts begged to 
be somewhere else in the room, save for where they were now.

&quot;I see that you have changed a lot as well, Mina. Oh yes...&quot; Her hands 
sought out her lover&#39;s breasts, carressing them gently, moving them 
through the fabric as if the clothes were not even there. Mina moaned in 
appreciation to the attentions of the younger. As her head lifted 
upwards and her eyes closed, Xian placed a firey trail of kisses on her 
neck, lightly using her teeth at times to make attempts to spark the 
flame that she knew was still there.

Suddenly, Mina&#39;s world seemed to jump. Pure sensation jolted through her 
slightly, and she gasped, fighting for what cool air there was in the 
room, just to quell the fire that had risen. The sensation stopped just 
as quickly, leaving Mina breathless and heady.

&quot;Whoa! That was... what was that?&quot; &quot;That-&quot; Xianghua said with a wicked 
smile on her face, &quot;Was one of my special tricks, reserved only for 
those who can handle it. I focused some spiritual energy into my kiss 
for an extra... &#39;kick&#39;. How&#39;d I do?&quot; Mina just nodded her head. &#39;Well, 
good. She&#39;s mine!&#39; &quot;So you liked that. Well, I&#39;ve got more than enough 
for one night. How about some more?&quot; Another nod.

&quot;Well said. Here we go!&quot; She performed the kiss again, and for a longer 
duration. As lips once again met lips, Mina moaned into the kiss, 
sinking deeper into joy. &#39;How I&#39;ve missed this.&#39; &quot;Mmm... whoa! Haha! 
That tickles!&quot; Xian had started kissing her gently and quickly, enough 
to give her the sensation that she was tickling her instead of kissing. 
As her tongue slid over her skin, cooling it and burning it at the same 
time, Xianghua smiled to herself.

She began performing her technique in short bursts, and doing so left a 
trail of fire down her neck and toward her shoulder. &quot;Mmm, Ahhhhhh... 
Don&#39;t stop, Xian.. Ohhhhhhh...&quot; She wasn&#39;t even to her breasts yet, and 
Mina was climbing towards an orgasm! &#39;Whoa, she&#39;s coming already? This 
is a little too strong!&#39; &quot;I think I&#39;ll...&quot; &quot;NO! Don&#39;t you dare stop!&quot; 
&quot;But if you come too soon, we won&#39;t have any fun!&quot; Mina was coming down 
from her high, which wasn&#39;t good. &quot;That&#39;s not fair...&quot; &quot;Oh, you&#39;ll see, 
just calm down!&quot; Reluctantly, she did so.

Xianghua wasted little time in untying the cumbersome silk scarf that 
hid Mina&#39;s breasts, as well as the sash around her waist. Then, sliding 
her hands under the sleeveless dress at her shoulders, she pulled the 
garb down, leaving Mina in the nude. And unlike most women, who would 
instintively cover themselves, Mina only smiled, though the rush of heat 
from being watched like this still came to her skin.

&quot;Well, then... ya wanna know how well I know you?&quot; she asked as she 
guided Mina down onto the bed behind them. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m still curious 
about that.&quot; Xianghua smiled. &#39;This should be fun!&#39; &quot;Your favorite 
spot... is right here!&quot; She began to make a trail of kisses to Mina&#39;s 
bosom. Once she reached the valley between her breasts, she started to 
lick and kiss her body in that space.

&quot;Eep! Oh, YEEEEEEEEssssssss... you were (gasp) right! Oh yeah! Ahhh... 
MORE!&quot; &#39;I&#39;m on target! But I think I&#39;ll tease her for a 
while...&#39;Xianghua began to alternate between quick kisses and 
agonizingly slow strokes of her tongue. &quot;That&#39;s right! Ahhhhh! Good, 
good! YES!&quot; But soon, she caught on... &quot;Hey, what&#39;re you doing? Go 
faster!&quot; Xianghua pouted in mock disappointment.

&quot;Aww, you catch on too quickly. All right. Let&#39;s continue!&quot; Xian&#39;s 
tongue made a trail from the valley to Mina&#39;s lips, which triggred a 
long, passionate moan from her. But the real surprise, simply from the 
unexpected, was when she put it in her mouth for a kiss.&quot;Mmm!&quot; 
&#39;Surprise, Mina!&#39; Her hands softly stroked her back, slowly making their 
way towards Mina&#39;s soft behind, another special point. She broke the 
kiss, leaving Mina&#39;s jeweled lips with a wonerful taste on them. 
&quot;That... was great. What else ya got?&quot;

&quot;Well, I think I found another hot spot! Tell me if I&#39;m right, ok?&quot; Mina 
smiled, anticipating the contact. &#39;I could come any minute! I don&#39;t know 
what&#39;ll happen, but I trust you, Xian!&#39; &quot;Go for it!&quot; Xian passionately 
grabbed her behind. Mina&#39;s breath became shallow, which confirmed Xian&#39;s 
guess. She pulled her into a tight embrace and kissed her neck in 
between moans. This got Xian worked up, and she started to moan softly. 
&quot;Oh, Mina.... mmm...&quot; Mina was in control now, though she had lost all 
semblance of her own control thanks to the young warrior&#39;s touches. And 
she wasted no time on words.

She kissed the young royal guard in the same manner as she had been 
kissed just moments ago. Though this was no surprise to her, she still 
liked it. &quot;Mmmmmm...&quot; Mina marveled at her lover&#39;s soft body. &#39;It&#39;s 
still so cute and soft. This is gonna be somethin&#39; else!&#39; Her lips 
started to make their way to Xian&#39;s young breasts, which were now a very 
decent size, compared to sixteen.

&quot;Well, well. I do believe that those look good enough to eat. Lesse how 
you taste this time around, Xian..&quot; Every kiss that Mina delivered sent 
Xian closer to the edge. No words, only moans and soft gasps were the 
topic of discussion. As she pulled at the breast, hungering for her very 
essence, Xian arched into her, giving her more of what she wanted. Mina 
shifted gears and started nursing on her friend&#39;s left breast, perking 
the other nipple to a sharp sensitivity. As she released it with a 
slight pop, the cool air of the room passed over it, bringing goosebumps 
to the skin.

Xianghua&#39;s eyes were hazy with desire, the brown orbs becoming nothing 
more than pools of devil&#39;s chocolate. Oh, how Mina wanted to dive into 
them, drowning forever. But the flames of her passion would not allow 
her to just look. What little rational command she had left over her 
urges broke, and she wasted no time in diving her tongue into her 
friend&#39;s sex, tasting what seemed to be her very soul.

&quot;Mmmmmmmm... Gods! (gasp) Yes... Don&#39;t stop, don&#39;t stop!&quot; Mina took her 
partner as close to the edge as possible... and stopped to deliver a 
french kiss. Xian was so far gone that she didn&#39;t notice.... until she 
opened her eyes and there was no one there. &quot;Hey! No fair! You can&#39;t run 
awa- AAAAAAAAAAHhhhh!&quot; Mina, moving faster than even she knew, went 
straight to her orchid and stuck her tongue inside again, her hands 
kneading and squeezing her breasts.

As the younger of the two arched her back, allowing the probing tongue 
more access, the taste drove her mad. &#39;You&#39;re coming, now. Right now. 
Your torture ends here, my love. Tonight, you&#39;ll finally be mine.&#39; Mina 
pinned her thighs to the bed, to keep them from crushing her, though 
they strained against her in their attempts to drive Mina within her 
completely, consuming all of her- or at least as much as possible.

Xian was racing toward the heavens. &#39;You&#39;re too strong, Mina! I can&#39;t... 
not now! But you&#39;re just too strong!&#39; She was going to come any 
moment... and with the position she was in, she couldn&#39;t help it. Then, 
her world went white, as Mina retreated her tongue and bit gently on the 
bundle of nerves that had now shown itself. She had effectively been 
thrown over the edge, and cried out her friend&#39;s name in a fit of 
passion and joy.

Meanwhile, Mina had quickly moved her mouth back to the tunnel and began 
feasting on the honey that was quicly cascading out of it, reveling in 
the taste as Xianghua came for her, and only for her.

Mina smiled as the orgasm died down, her lips shining faintly with the 
fresh dew that had collected on them. But she would not kiss her just 
yet. Oh no, not yet. She was not satisfied, and her entire being 
demanded it.

&quot;Now Xian, You can have your fun.&quot;
_________________________________________________________________________

The building, save for the two lovers, Benten, and a few other guests, 
was empty and remarkably quiet... deathly quiet. It was a wonder that no 
one heard the passionate cries of the women... or the carnage that took 
place in the streets... or the door to the inn being torn away... or the 
heavy footfalls of those with an intent to kill...
_________________________________________________________________________

Xianghua leaned in for a kiss, longing for that which was so rightfully 
hers, but not because it was hers. It was because it must have been so 
much sweeter on Mina&#39;s lips, and shone temptingly at her, the moonlight 
winking and gleaming in it&#39;s depths. But Mina pinned her to the bed, 
wagging her head at the woman on the bed in a disapproving manner.

&quot;Now, now.. it wouldn&#39;t be fair if I didn&#39;t give you mine, would it?&quot; A 
hungry whine came from her, almost as if what was left of her human side 
was fading fast, and all thoughts were pushed aside. Mina only smiled, 
wondering just when the control had shifted. Perhaps releasing her 
passions had awakened Xianghua&#39;s in effect.

&quot;Well then, if you want what&#39;s here so bad,&quot; she pointed to her lips, 
still wet with the sweet juices. &quot;You&#39;re going to have to get busy down 
here.&quot; One hand slid down her body, and she closed her eyes, enjoying 
the feel of her own hand carressing a breast for a moment before moving 
down between her thighs. Her index and middle fingers slid in easily, 
signifying that Xian&#39;s cries alone had done much for her mood.

Xianghua strained against her hand and hips, trying to release her hold 
on her as Mina tortured her with the sight of pleasuring herself, the 
moans and cries stoking her already lit fires. Not a whine, but a moan 
now, a name. Something of her sanity was left, though it was left in a 
state of utter begging.

&quot;Minaaaaa...&quot;

Her response was deep and sensuous, something that possibly would never 
have happened earlier in life. Amazing what four years of simply 
thinking about the one you loved did to a personality.

&quot;You want this.. don&#39;t you?&quot; Mina said after breathing in through her 
teeth with a hiss. Xianghua merely nodded, forgetting about the first 
set of lips, and merely wanting the second even more. &quot;Then hold still.&quot; 
She immediately relaxed, and the Seung casually shifted her position so 
that her hips were directly above her head. Taking her fingers out, she 
offered them to Xian, which she greatfully accepted, greedily sucking 
the honey from them. After finishing that off, she wasted little time in 
grabbing her hips possesively, and lifting herself up to Mina&#39;s sex.

&quot;Mmmm... nn..&quot; The tongue went in, and everything else, save for moans 
and whispered entreaties, was out the window. The high that Mina was 
already on escalated into something deeper and wider as her love feasted 
on her honey while she shifted and suqeezed her own breasts. Everything 
seemed right, save for one thing.

It was not enough.

Mina had enough good sense- or heady passion, depending on your point of 
view- to place her hands behind Xianguha&#39;s head and press her towards 
her hips, driving the tongue further into her while she rocked against 
her face, the soft skin doing nothing to hurt her. &quot;Xiaaaan... please 
give this to me... please...&quot; Xian had no choice but to do so. Besides, 
it was her pleasure to give as she was given.

And so, with a little help from Mina, Xian had gotten what she had so 
wanted- Mina&#39;s cry of joy, and a flood of her honey at the same time. 
The one thing that she could think of at the time was how good it 
tasted, how she couldn&#39;t get enough, how it was her very soul that she 
was feasting on... how she loved her.

Mina finally slid her body, drenched with sweat and the sweet smell of 
cherry blossoms, down Xian&#39;s until they were face to face again. With 
the last of her strength, she finally put her lips to the younger woman, 
still three years behind even after four years and age 20.

That kiss sent a shockwave of power and emotion through both of them. A 
bond of body, heart, and soul had been formed by the kiss, their juices 
and bodies becoming one, along with their souls.

The kiss sealed their fate.

The kiss alerted the men to their presence.

To their room.

To the attack...

Hmm... good, bad, whatever? IF you have any insight about this, you know 
how to reach me! Sorry if it wasn&#39;t all that romantic, but I think it 
started out that way, don&#39;t you? My imagination ran away with me, so 
blame it, not me!

- Next Chapter -

The battle for sanity is no longer in the West. The two souls must now 
fight for their lives as they head for the docks. Mina must step up to 
the challenge and search within for true power. And the secret behind 
her zanba-toh is revealed...</pre>
