<h1>The Seeds of Evil: Phoenix Rising (part 1 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<pre>After being dragged home- for the second time- Mina was now fated to 
marry the idiot son of the Kim family. She knew that, even though he 
claimed to love her, it was a major power move: the Kims would own the 
Seung dojo when Han Myong passed away. This added fuel to the fires of 
her frustration, which were already burning within her during her 
training.

Added to these were the news of the conflict between Japan and Korea, 
the freedom of life outside of the school, and a thirst to not only 
prove herself, but to gain her independence. So she set out once again. 
However, she was not without some sense. Mina had seen the true face of 
Soul Edge, and not once, but twice...

It seemed that she was now faced with the lingering doubt that she could 
ever love Hwang... thus, she gave in, and vowed to get over him. She 
delved further into her training, using it to fend off the many men who 
made an attempt to court her.

During this time, an aspiring student had risen to the same plateau as 
Hwang himself. However, much to Mina&#39;s enjoyment, he had been refused a 
challenge, just before Hwang left. As he worried over the matter, Mina 
approached him with the White Storm, and told him to search within its 
mirrored depths for an awnser to the situation.

She didn&#39;t think he would act on it...

Now, she was obligated to go after him, intent on saving him from the 
oblivion that she had thrown him into. However, her own heart longed for 
years gone by.. and the young woman who had definitely had a lasting 
impact on her life. Was she in love with the freedom.. or the girl that 
had become a woman?

After asking her father for permission, he had somehow accepted the 
decision. Overjoyed, she began to prepare herself for the journey. 
Unfortunately, she would be leaving in a different disposition by the 
end of the night...

Chapter 1: Frustration and Freedom
________________________________________________________________________

&quot;You&#39;re all idiots! Nothin&#39; but a bunch of money-hungry jerks!&quot; shouted 
Seung Mina as she stomped out of her father&#39;s presence. Just the day 
before, she had run into the eldest son of the Kim family, who was 
trying to convince her to settle down... and with HIM, to her disgust. 
Hearing the racket- and the resounding slap to the face afterwards- Han 
Myong began to scold his unruly daughter. &quot;Now, look! I&#39;ve tried to be 
reasonable with you... But I&#39;ve lost my patience now! Can&#39;t you-&quot; Mina 
immediately interrupted with &quot;&#39;Be a normal girl&#39;? Yeah, sure! Look! 
They&#39;ve lost their sense of self-worth... Their pride and honor! If I 
have to change the way I look and act to make friends, then it&#39;s not 
worth it! Besides, this guy only wants the school, not me!&quot;

Shocked, her father shot back with &quot;Can you prove this?&quot; &quot;Humph! even if 
I could, you&#39;ll never listen to me! You never do! I don&#39;t know why I 
even bother!&quot; And with that, she stomped away. All things considered, 
she was treated with more respect as a child. She began to remember the 
days when she was younger, and such things did not bother her. &#39;I had 
friends, a life, and my father&#39;s respect. Even Hwang paid more attention 
to me back then. I used to want to be just like him... strong, agile, 
and a great fighter. I think... I loved him. But then I grew up... and 
they acted like I didn&#39;t exsist! And now I&#39;m some prize to be given 
away! I used to cry... but now I don&#39;t! I&#39;m not a kid anymore!&#39; Her 
thoughts finally became words... &quot;I&#39;m not some baby that can be pushed 
around! I&#39;m a woman! A warrior! I&#39;ve got the right to go where I 
please!&quot; And all this was said while packing her worldly possessions in 
a bag. However, her father was listening in on this dialog... And 
decided to do what he thought he had to. He locked the door. &quot;For your 
own good...&quot; &quot;No!!! I&#39;m NOT gonna be in here forever, y&#39;know! HEY! You 
hear me?&quot; He didn&#39;t, for he was already gone.

&quot;Awwwwww CRAP! What am I supposed to do NOW?&quot; Mina franticly looked 
around for an answer... And found one. &quot;&#39;Be a good girl&#39;. Yeah, right! 
I&#39;m not really gonna stick around for this nonsense.&quot; She got to work on 
the lock. &quot;Even if it takes all night... I&#39;m getting out of here!&quot; And 
it did, in fact, take all night. But nonetheless, Mina was rewarded with 
an unlocked door. &quot;I got it! Now to finish packing up...&quot; She was, of 
course, talking about her Scarlet Thunder, the mighty blade that had 
served her well during her last outing. Now, it was probably locked away 
in the treasure room, along with the other treasure swords, White Storm, 
and Blue Thunder, which was in Hwang&#39;s possession. Looking at the empty 
space made Mina think of him... And it angered her. &quot;Good riddance. I 
never want to see Hwang again.&quot;

She took hold of her weapon... and was reeling in pain. &quot;Wh... What&#39;s 
this about? It burns... why?&quot; As she pondered, a voice rang out in her 
head... &#39;It begins.&#39; &quot;What? Who are you and what are you talking about?&quot; 
Silence... &quot;I need more sleep... Wait, no I don&#39;t! I&#39;ve gotta get out of 
here!&quot; Mina cautiously approached the weapon, and as she approached, she 
heard a pulsing sound. &quot;What&#39;s this? A heartbeat... but it&#39;s not me! 
Then what...&quot; &#39;You are afraid, are you not?&#39; &quot;Hey now, I&#39;m not scared! 
Who do you think you are?&quot; &#39;I am the presence within every warrior. 
Therefore, I know you better than you know yourself.&#39; Mina, who was 
obviously confused, as well as frustrated, tried to retrieve her weapon, 
and was burned again. &#39;Humph. I knew it.&#39; &quot;Dammit! How am I supposed 
to-&quot; Mina was silenced by the voice. &#39;I trust that you don&#39;t have time 
to waste.&#39; &quot;That&#39;s right! I&#39;ve gotta go, NOW!&quot; &#39;Then calm down.&#39; &quot;Huh? 
How&#39;s that supposed to help?&quot; &#39;I leave it up to you.&#39; &quot;Wait!&quot;

Silence again. &quot;How weird...&quot; However, she was already beginning to calm 
down. Mina quickly remembered her training from Kong Xiquaing... and 
began to let her mind wander. She thought of her time away from home... 
the battles, the adventures, and the freedom. She had learned many new 
things during her travels, including how to focus the energy within her 
soul. She had never tried this technique before, but she still knew how. 
She took a deep breath through her nose, and gathered her energy. She 
guided that energy to her left hand, and in doing so, reached her hand 
toward the weapon... and gripped it. &#39;Gone... the pain is gone!&#39; &quot;Ha! No 
sweat! Now I can leave.&quot;

As mina approached the gates, she noticed that the guards were sleeping. 
&quot;If father saw you like this, he&#39;d be SO mad!&quot; at this, the guards woke 
up. &quot;You hear something?&quot; The other guard said, rather sleepily, &quot;The 
wind. Why?&quot; &quot;But, I thought...&quot; The guard scoffed, saying, &quot;Heh! &#39;You 
thought&#39;, huh? Right...&quot; Mina had already cleared the wall.
