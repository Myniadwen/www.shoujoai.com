<h1>The Seeds of Evil: Phoenix Rising (part 7 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../soulcal/seedsevil-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>	Any of the Divine Treasures could be another Soul Edge,
for they all have the same properties: the capability to absorb 
and channel spirit energy, the persona within each weapon that
makes them come alive, and the supernatural strength that it
grants the owner in exchange for his or her energy. 

	Of course, the form of these weapons depends on the will
of the user, whether it be for good or evil, for both are within
the hearts of men. But it is for them to decide which path to take...

Chapter 7: Rock the Boat (Pt. 2): Taming the Red Dragon
____________________________________________________________________

	Morning. The sunlight gently woke the two lovers, who had
deepened the bond between them the other night. They were now head
over heels in love with each other, and would go to any lengths for 
one another, even death. But they would cross that bridge when they 
got to it... at the moment, Mina was explaining her plan to her friend 
and lover, Xianghua...

	&quot;So, when I noticed that, I decided to try it. What do you 
think?&quot; Xian nodded. &quot;It&#39;s a good idea. Can I help in any way?&quot;
&quot;Actually... yeah, you could. Everyone should be on deck by now,
right? Well, tell them to clear a space for me. We don&#39;t want anyone
getting hurt, do we?&quot; &quot;All right, consider it done. Be careful, though.
Each weapon&#39;s persona is different... and this one may be hostile.
If anything happens, break contact.&quot; Mina&#39;s expression turned stern.
&quot;I&#39;ll be careful. I&#39;m gonna get ready now.&quot;
____________________________________________________________________

	Mina had retreated to her room and barred the door. She
did not want any distractions or interruptions during her 
meditation. &#39;Okay... empty your mind. Don&#39;t force the thoughts out,
just gently let them go... it&#39;s easy.&#39; With that, she closed her
eyes and started her breathing... slow and deep. And she let her
mind wander. Her mind drifted back to the Imperial Garden in 
China.... how the exotic flowers danced in the breeze, including
her favorite, the Japanese cherry blossom...  her body started to
relax, and was free to move... she started to drift away...

	And before she was lost in her forced sleep, she had a
waking dream. A light was before her... it gave out a familliar
warmth. &#39;Is this my soul?&#39; She decided to investigate... and as
she got closer, it seemed to pull her in. Soon, she was lost in
the glow... and she absorbed it. At once, a powerful force
invaded Mina&#39;s body. It was overwhelming... but there was still 
that warmth, as if it meant no harm. &#39;So, it IS my soul. There&#39;s
something different about it though... something stronger. Maybe...
this is love. Not just for Xian, but for father as well. And my
country, and any one who fights for it... even Hwang.&#39;

	Then, she woke... and knew what she had to fight for.
&#39;I still have to protect those who I care about. Even if it&#39;s
those who annoy me, I still care about them. Hwang... I may not
love you anymore, but I will still care about you. It&#39;s my turn
to protect you!&#39; Full of new life and strength, Mina emerged 
from her room and approached the upper deck...
____________________________________________________________________

	&quot;Hey, here she comes. Clear a path, please!&quot; Mina rose 
from the cabins to what appeared to be somewhat of a crowd.
&#39;There&#39;re more people on this boat than I thought. Well, I
won&#39;t disappoint them.&#39; &quot;Do you mind if I warm up. Xian?&quot;
Xian was somewhat aggravated at this. &quot;I thought you were ready?&quot;
&quot;Doesn&#39;t hurt to warm up, you know that.&quot; Indeed, she did. &quot;Fine.&quot;
Mina smiled and said &quot;Thanks.&quot; She stood up straight and took
a deep breath. 

	The cuts, stabs, and spins of a pattern dance had begun.
Mina showed her mastery of her own mixture of Ling Sheng Su rod
arts and Seung&#39;s Long Sword with grace and expertise. Finishing 
it off with a powerful Yin and Yang strike, Mina surprised Xian
greatly. &#39;Kilik&#39;s most powerful strike... But that move takes
a while to master! So why is hers stronger than his?&#39; Indeed, 
the young swordswoman could sense a greater amount of power
behind the attack than even Kilik could muster.

	&#39;Maybe that&#39;s the true power of that strike! Amazing...&#39;
&quot;Hey! I&#39;m ready to start!&quot; At this, those who thought it was over
came running back. Mina called out to the audience. &quot;I need 
someone to stand right in front of me, please! Don&#39;t be afraid,
just step forward! Anyone!&quot; The crowd seemed to step back at this,
which confirmed Mina&#39;s suspicions. &#39;No one&#39;s gonna do this...&#39;
&quot;Allright, then. Xian, could you help me?&quot; Her friend stepped 
forward. &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, every one! I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen
this before, right? Then you know what I&#39;m gonna do...&quot;

	Then, Mina pulled her headband over her eyes, took hold
of her weapon, and after a deep breath, tightened her grip on the 
rod. This channeled her energy through the zanba-toh, transforming 
it into the Scarlet Thunder. The crowd was amazed as this took place.
Mina, however wasn&#39;t, even as she heard the voice of the persona within 
her weapon. &#39;What do you wish of me?&#39; &#39;Nothing... I just want to get
to know you.&#39; &#39;Hmph.... very well. But must I speak in your tongue
again? I tire of that.&#39; Mina smiled at that. &#39;No. I think I can
understand you now.&#39;

	&#39;We shall see...&#39; Nothing else was said as Mina began her 
demonstration. She began with a test of her weapon... she wanted 
something that a normal sword couldn&#39;t cut through... namely, a stone.
So she slowly moved her feet around in order to find one of a decent   
size. And, as some strange brand of luck would have it, she found one.
&#39;How lucky! Well, let&#39;s do it.&#39; &#39;As you wish.&#39; Mina felt the strength
flowing through her. Her muscles came to life... and her foot 
stomped on the deck. The stone flew straight into the air... &#39;This
strength is incredible!&#39; She brought her weapon down in a Spinning
Divide, and cleaved the rock in two.

	The people were shocked: first at the big stone flying into the
air with one stomp, then at the blade passing cleanly through the same
stone. And to add to the feat, Mina tested the edge...
and still cut her thumb on it. Nothing short of a catastrophe could
dull the edge of the mighty Scarlet Thunder. But Mina was the most 
surprised, as she could see everything clearly, even though she made
sure that she was blinded. &#39;What&#39;s this? I can still see!&#39; &#39;No, you 
cannot. But you can hear... and touch... and smell. And, of course,
you have me to guide you.&#39; &#39;So, this is your doing!&#39; &#39;No. The strength I
gave your body improved all aspects of your being.&#39; 

	&#39;So, it&#39;s still me, with your help... I still can&#39;t believe it!&#39;
&#39;Well then, continue with what you were doing. Then we shall see...&#39;
&#39;Oh, right!&#39; Mina had somewhat stalled in the next part of her
demonstration during the conversation with the persona. &quot;Sorry! 
Let&#39;s continue.&quot; Mina whispered into Xianghua&#39;s ear. &quot;Whatever you do,
don&#39;t move, and don&#39;t be afraid.&quot; &quot;I trust you, Mina.&quot; Mina stepped
back and adopted the defensive Ling Sheng Su stance. she then began
twirling the blade like a baton with the Seung style&#39;s Heavy Crane
move. Each strike of the attack came dangerously close to hitting her 
friend, and yet they missed. 

	Without missing a beat, she smoothly linked the move with
a Sheng style move, the Phoenix Roar. an appropriate name, for the
roaring sound that came from the weapon as it passed through the 
air showed the tremendous force behind the attack. Then, as if it
were a second nature to her, she linked that to another Sheng
move, the Phoenix Flare, which went upwrds instead of down.
After launching into the air with the last stroke, the hard part 
came. She set herself up for a Raven Slaughter Thrust which, 
hopefully, would pass harmlessly to the side of Xian&#39;s head...

	She struck... and the persona yelled &#39;Stop!&#39;
If Xian had moved, her ear would&#39;ve been cleanly cut off. But she 
stood still, and the blade passed dangerously close to her cheek.
Still, she was unharmed. &#39;You saved her... thank you!&#39; &#39;You
truly give me too much credit. Most warriors would not have the 
reflexes to stop an attack that moved at that speed.... you 
have learned much. I am only bringing out your true potential.&#39;
Mina lifted the veil from her eyes to the sound of cheers, applause,
and sighs of relief. &#39;Hey... maybe you&#39;re right. We make a good
team, don&#39;t we?&#39; &#39;So that means that you trust me, as you used to?&#39;
Mina and Xian bowed to their audience. &#39;Yes, I do. And it&#39;s
good to know that you&#39;re always there.&#39; 
____________________________________________________________________

	Ming dynasty China. They had finally arrived. The two women
wasted no time finding an inn to spend the night in. Before turning 
in, Mina had one final question to ask. &quot;Hey, Xian... why didn&#39;t
you move?&quot; &quot;I told you, silly: I trusted you. People who love each
other put their faith in each other. Isn&#39;t that true?&quot; Mina 
smiled and said &quot;You&#39;re right. But you weren&#39;t scared? Not even a
little?&quot; &quot;Well, yeah! You scared me to death with that thrust at
the end! But I still trusted you, so I didn&#39;t move.&quot; Mina 
admired the trust and loyalty that her friend possesed. &#39;I fail
so many times... but she forgives me and still trusts me. Xian,
thank you.&#39;

	This chapter is dedicated to all those hardcore fans of the
Soul Calibur series who even know the names of each move! By the way,
Phoenix Roar is one of Kilik&#39;s signature moves, and the Heavy Crane
is the baton-twirling move that Mina is known for. As for the
Phoenix Flare to Raven Slaughter Thrust combination, Both Kilik
and Mina share that move. I hope this is a preview of things to come!
And even if it isn&#39;t, I hope this is a good chapter.

- Next Chapter -

	The peace that our heroines held so firmly in their grasp
slips away as China gears for war. And for some reason, Xian
avoids the palace... but why? Secrets are uncovered, and the truth
is revealed.... they must pass through China with careful steps.</pre>
