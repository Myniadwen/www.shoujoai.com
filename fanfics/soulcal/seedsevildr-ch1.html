<h1>The Seeds of Evil: Dragon Rising (part 1 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The Himilayas...

A bird with crimson eyes and black wings soared through the air, the 
eyes alert and sharp. It saw the travelers below head towards the nearest 
port city with neither pause in their stride, nor a dampened spirit.
This did not matter... what did matter were the auras surrouding them.
Tangible things of great power in the avian&#39;s enhanced eyesight. That
was all the bird needed to see, aside from where they were all headed.

Continuing to follow them from the air, heading towards the port town,
it noticed the boat that was headed to Japan and veered off, heading
back towards an abandoned shack in the mountains. There, it joined its
brethren and their master...

A young girl of seventeen years old, wearing clothing that was mostly
in tatters and shreds. Green hair, along with clothing that was a
montage of emerald, amythyst, and the glint of steel leg armor. She
traced her fingertips on the fine, razor-sharp edge of a quite humongous
chakram, known as Aiselne Drossel. As the bird flew into the window,
she allowed it to land on her purple-clad right hand, stroking it
absently.

&quot;Pretty bird... yes, pretty. Do you have something to show me?&quot;

In fact, it did. The two of them locked eyes, the bird and the woman
with the disturbingly empty purple eyes. Images and visions flashed 
through the mind of the young woman. Her blank expression turned into
a look of madness and a twisted grin. They were strong- especially
the woman with the reddish-brown hair. Yes, strong.

&quot;Good work, pretty bird. They&#39;ll do nicely. We&#39;ll be seeing them soon.&quot;

In her excitement, she pricked the index finger of her left hand on
the sharp edge of her chakram and drew blood.

Instead of a prick of pain... she moaned in pleasure, her eyes finally
changing from the demented glare to one of passion and desire. She 
wanted blood, and she wanted it as soon as possible. Hers, someone 
else&#39;s, it didn&#39;t matter. She licked her finger... then sucked on it 
hard, drawing even more of her vital fluids from the cut.

Pain would have sung in others.

This girl mewled pleasantly at it.

She grinned sadisticly as she stepped out of the shack in the mountains,
looking out towards the horizon and the sea. &quot;This&#39;ll be fun! Lots of
fun! I can&#39;t wait to tell my master what I&#39;ve found...&quot; She actually
giggled for the first time in days.

&quot;It&#39;ll be incredible to watch them die!!&quot;

Chapter 1- End of the Beginning

________________________________________________________________________

Seong Mi-Na stretched out, her joints popping and crackling. It felt
good to be on the sea again after so long! Talim however, had never seen
the ocean before. Well, she had seen water- that was clear enough. She
had simply never seen so much of it in one wide space. So while
Xianghua and Mi-Na were seasoned travelers, this was Talim&#39;s first
journey to anywhere.

&quot;Wow,&quot; the young sybil uttered, almost in a breathless state of wonder.
&quot;I&#39;ve never seen so much of it in one place! How far out does it go?&quot;
Mi-Na shrugged. She had never really been anywhere regarding a boat 
besides Japan, China, and the waters surrounding Korea. &quot;I don&#39;t know, 
really. I guess someone will have to find that out someday. For now, 
let&#39;s get a game plan together for when we hit land.&quot;

Chai Xianghua nodded, but continued looking out at the vast ocean,
her mind in deep thought. She had a sister that she had never known
about, and now she was dead. She had never known her, nor had she
known her father... her mother, Xiangfei, never told any stories about
him. &quot;Cut your way through an uncertain future, and break through your
cursed past.&quot;

(Cursed past... was my father truly that kind of man?)

A part of her did not want to know the awnser to that.

She was so deep in thought that she did not notice her coming from 
behind and the right, holding her snugly in an attempt to comfort her.
Her eyes widened slightly before realizing who it was. She could not
fight the sigh of contentment that came forth. What was it about this
young girl that made everyone so calm and at ease?

Certainly, she could read the wind. That much was certain. She could
see visions. She could see entirely into the past, and somewhat into
the future. But certainly, she could not read hearts as well?
Nevertheless, Xianghua was grateful for the physical contact. Then,
the young voice spoke in a sagely tone that was uncommon for someone
that age.

&quot;What is past is past. Don&#39;t become like our new companion, whose
heart is burdened by what he could not control. You must let this 
pass over and around you, as a stone in a river.&quot; Xianghua&#39;s eyes 
widened in slight shock. Did Talim know what she was feeling? Could 
she indeed read hearts and souls by simply looking at the way the wind 
curved and flowed around a person?

&quot;Y-you couldn&#39;t possibly know...&quot; Talim shushed her, snuggling
into Xian&#39;s back. &quot;I do. I can&#39;t know what you&#39;re thinking right now...
but I do know how you feel. Confused, lost... frustrated... somewhat
angry.&quot; She had hit it right on the mark. Xianghua&#39;s practical mind
made an attempt to rationalize the situation, but it was in a haze
from Talim&#39;s all-too-accurate guess.

Before anything else could be said... Xianghua began to cry. Tears
fell from her eyes without her knowing why. Some dormant part of
her soul was weeping for the sister whom had never lived to see her
own kin and the father whom she had never met.

&quot;It&#39;s all right... take as much time as you like. I&#39;m right here...&quot;

________________________________________________________________________

From a distance, Mi-Na could feel the mixture of emotions from one of
her mental links. She walked towards Xianghua slowly, knowing exactly
what was wrong with her, when Talim approached. She had seen the entire
story instead of having it told to her, and knew much better than
Mi-Na did about how she felt.

She hung back and smiled as Talim held Xianghua close, and could feel
the utter despair that was called forth from Talim&#39;s simple touch.
The Seong prodigy was almost jealous of them- they fit each other
perfectly, as if nothing could separate them. Not even her.

Then, she shook her head. Why should she be jealous of the two of them?
This was the way things should be. Feeling somewhat like a third wheel,
the fiery young woman headed downstairs. However, she felt a disturbing
presence in the general area... with her training in the Ling-Sheng-Su
arts, she was intuitively connected to all energy; all of life.

She had trained to the point where she was on a higher level than even
Kilik could reach, and was able to sense things that were amiss. However,
like any new ability that was learned, it was odd at first. Like a note
that was played off key before it resumed it&#39;s original perfect pitch.

Mina&#39;s senses sharpened immediately at this odd shift, her combat 
reflexes ready for any situation that came forth. And yet, she was
perfectly still and calm as she casually looked around. She could feel
nothing from the people on board. Nothing was unusual about the surface
of the water, nor what lay beneath it.

Everything was as it should be... and yet, she knew it wasn&#39;t.

Below the deck, Kilik&#39;s fragment of the Dvarpa-Yuga shone briefly, 
warding off the twisted aura that quickly flashed across and through the 
vessel. His eyes snapped open from their meditative contemplation and he 
looked upwards toward the main deck.

&quot;Something stirs...&quot;

He might not have been able to sense something wrong, but the mirror 
could. It still had its divine properties, even while shattered. He 
stood from the wood floor and opened the door in order to step outside, 
his rod, the Kali-Yuga in hand. Whatever it was, he would be ready 
for it.

________________________________________________________________________

However, when he got there, the others were already one step ahead of
him. Gathered on the deck in a huddle, Xianghua saw Kilik approaching
and motioned him towards the group. No one minded them- what they were
up to was none of their business. However, it might become their business
quite soon.

&quot;Okay, did you guys feel that,&quot; Mina began, &quot;Or was it just my
imagination?&quot; They all shook their heads in the negative. Talim and
Xianghua, even in their embrace, had felt the stirrings of something
out of place. Xianghua spoke up first, speaking on her findings.

&quot;I didn&#39;t see anything out of the ordinary, but I did feel as if a
pair of eyes were on my back, or something of that sort. I&#39;m betting
no-one else on this boat felt it but us...&quot; They all nodded in tandem.
Indeed, they each felt as if they were being looked at from some distant
place, though nothing was harmful on first look.

Talim voiced her theory. &quot;It could be an effect of the poisoning of the
world in general. The evil is everywhere these days... Perhaps something is 
trying to block our path before we even reach land?&quot; They all had that in
mind. The question was, what was it? Mi-Na shook her head. &quot;There&#39;s no way
to know where these people are, or how they&#39;re able to see us... if
that&#39;s the case. We&#39;ll each keep watch tonight until something pops
up- most of the creeps come out by then.&quot;

They all nodded together. Kilik didn&#39;t need to say anything after all;
Mina&#39;s overwhelming charisma had run him over like a freight train.
She took command of the situation immediately, her sharp and trained
mind entirely focused on keeping the people safe, as well as themselves.
If nothing else, he had some respect for her. The only thing he said was
&quot;I suppose I could take the first watch.&quot;

Mina nodded, taking note of his suggestion. &quot;It&#39;s a good idea, but you&#39;re
the least likely of us to pass out in the middle of the night. I&#39;ll go
first- this is my idea, and I should take the risk first.&quot; Xianghua
and Talim smiled brightly at their unofficial leader. As she contemplated
her actions, Talim nodded towards Mina.

(She&#39;s got such drive behind that careless exterior... when it comes down
to it, she&#39;s the only person that could really lead something like this.)

Xianghua simply wanted to take Mina into her arms and kiss her senseless,
not sparing time for thought. This was the kind of person she wanted for
the rest of her life. Someone strong, and yet willing to be gentle for
the sake of those she cared for. Not to mention someone beautiful...
Mi-Na looked exceptionally beautiful right now, even with the stark,
serious look on her face.

(No,) Xianghua thought. (This is when she looks her most beautiful. When-
ever she fights or is under pressure- this is when she truly shines. I
could just take her now, but we&#39;re in an emergency.)

Still, the thought of making Mi-Na scream and writhe with extacy out
here in open daylight sent pleasant tingles up and down the young woman&#39;s 
spine. However, the other two bond members felt that same thrill, and had 
to suppress it. Fun and games were for later.

&quot;Right,&quot; their leader said in a confident voice. &quot;Let&#39;s see what whoever
is watching us is made of. We start the plan tonight.&quot; They all nodded,
and went their seperate ways again. Mi-Na looked to the sky, seeing a
black bird overhead. No, wait... two of them. Normally, she wouldn&#39;t
mind a bit of bird watching.

But their color and the fact that they were just close enough to listen
in... worried her. She moved below deck swiftly. Perhaps it was her
imagination, but something in her mind told her that those birds were
the ones watching them...

But birds are birds. They are nothing to worry about. Right?

________________________________________________________________________

The crows flying overhead did not waver from their path. It were as if
they had a sort of obsession for watching the travelers go their way.
It was unsettling, not to mention entirely too odd to be just 
coincidence. What was even stranger, and yet so common, was when two
more birds came down in a few minutes. Then, two more... and then four
more. In less than an hour, an entire flock of black birds with red
eyes were overhead, even making some people look up into the sky in
slight amusement.

They had never seen so many crows in their lives... and this was,
unbeknownst to them, a bad thing. Crows, for the most part, were not
known to appear in such abundance so quickly. Soon, their eyes were
trained on the people below, a malicious glint in their eyes.

(Heh, there we go. This is an excellent start. Go, my pretty birds!
Fetch more souls for my master!)

With that, the now twenty or so birds flocked upwards... caught a
lucky thermal.. and divebombed the crowd, their razor-sharp beaks
and talons piercing flesh and cracking skulls. Screaming was quickly
heard as the patrons rushed below decks, carrying their wounded with
them. Those that were too far gone were left there, screaming in agony.

Talim felt it coming before it happened, though.

As something unnatural shifted in the wind, that same sickness that
she had felt intensifying from above, she craned her head upwards,
tapping Xianghua lightly on the shoulder as she did so. The two young
women looked up as the flock of crows moved as one, circling high into
the air. Both of them knew that it was an incoming attack, and Xianghua&#39;s
jian responded to the twisted energy, shifting form into the Krita-Yuga
instantaneously as she tightened her grip on the weapon before drawing it.
Thus as she drew her weapon, it were as if a blade of light came from the
sheath before the sacred metal re-formed itself into the antithesis of
evil.

Talim had no such sacred artifact, but she drew her ceeremonial weapons 
anyway as the birds finished their initial ascent. Knowing that they
were coming down fast and who they were targeting, she briefly brought
her arms upwards and inwards in a quick circle, drawing the winds toward
her... before taking off in a run.

A quite fast run.

Her petit figure blurred as she raced forward at an incredible speed,
leaping forwards and tucking her legs in at the same time as she approached
the crowds. Within a mere two seconds she was in the middle of it, curled 
tightly in a forward sault that was carried and propelled by the wind.
At the apex of her leap, the birds were coming down far too fast for her
to stop them all. Nonetheless, she lashed out with her elbow blades,
shifting her weight further forward in order to spin faster and tighter.

She flipped a total of three times, taking out many of the killer birds
and giving the patrons the time they needed to flee. Landing near one of
the railings at the far end of the ship, she turned around, weapons held
up in a defensive stance. She still saw the birds tear apart those whom 
had fallen, piece by piece. She could feel their souls being torn from 
their bodies by some other force- someone was going to take the very life
from them before they could escape!

How did she know it was someone? Simple. A soul is not meant to be taken.
Only one with exceptional talents of their own could do such a thing,
and it is still unnatural. However, there was nothing she could do about
it. Well, there was... but another flock of birds had blocked her path.

(Goddess, they&#39;re everywhere! Who could command such a force?)

________________________________________________________________________

Mi-Na felt it as well, but later than Talim had. She sensed the
wrongness when the birds began their descent. Anything that moved with
the intent to harm or kill, she could pick up. And the intent was not
visible until the birds were on their way down.

&quot;Kilik, get down there, now.&quot;

Why did she ask him to retreat? He could sense the incoming attack as
well- or at least, the mirror could. But she knew that he had a heavy
disadvantage in this one. His weapon could not change form or call any
sort of attack forth- the only thing it could do was absorb the
energy from attacks, as well as just about anything else. Any strike
that was taken against him was lessened in effect and pain. But only
lessened. He could only do so much, even for a Chosen One.

Still, his awnser was a simple one. &quot;I&#39;m staying. I can help.&quot;

When he stood firm, she sighed as she tightened her grip on her weapon,
just as she noticed Talim approaching. Her weapon shone crimson as her 
left hand re-shaped the rod, turning it from the rod into a six inch 
handle before quickly moving to the blade, turning it from that of a 
zhanmadao into a standard 35&quot; curved blade that was 6&quot; wide at the widest 
point. The hilt was formed from the section underneath the blade, assuming
the shape of a chinese dragon.

&quot;Fine- just make sure you can do something-&quot;

And then, the people came forth after Talim&#39;s impressive leap. The 
remaining birds, heedless of the slaying of their kin, came after them.

&quot;Because here they come!&quot;

Mina wasted no time in cutting down the birds that came at her, her
strokes sure and swift as her blade flashed with a brief burst of
red and orange fire upon each bird&#39;s death. Kilik had his own plan
formulated when he saw Talim being assailed, and the mirror&#39;s fragment
around his neck flashed briefly at the twisted energies that were trying
to pry the souls from the still-living bodies of the five men and women
that were still there. Moving towards them quickly and silently, the flock
busy with Talim while she warded off their blows, he swept his rod through
the air above the screaming people that were simply living corpses at this
point, and granted them a peaceful death.

His rod had taken their spirit energies before they could be harnessed,
effectively ending their suffering. The birds didn&#39;t seem to care- it was a
free meal. A somber expression on his face after performing such an act,
he looked towards Mina, who had just incinerated the last of the attacking
birds before shutting the wooden double doors.

&quot;Done. Who would do this sort of thing,&quot; he asked her.

Then again, one shouldn&#39;t ask questions that one does not want to know.
Mi-Na did not want to know who was behind the attempted massacre of
an entire cargo ship that was carrying passengers to Japan... She
didn&#39;t want to know, beacuse if she did, she just might tear the boat
asunder with the force of her righteous fury. Not that she didn&#39;t think
anything of her anger at the moment, but that was exactly what it was.

The Flames of Passion were the result of the strong emotions that were
used as fuel for the Scarlet Thunder&#39;s abilities- the shift from polearm 
to broadsword is an example. When these emotions reached a breaking point, 
the weapon changed from the zhanmadao, its standard form, into a kwandao- 
a vicious all-purpose weapon that had an edge surrounding the 12&quot; blade, 
with a wave pattern on the back before a hook jutted upwards and outwards, 
gracefully and yet forcefully. There was an 11&quot; spear on the back, used as 
a counter-balance as well as another method of attack.

That said, her question was about to be awnsered when the birds that were 
feasting and the birds that were currently assailing Talim began to 
converge in the center of the bloodstained deck, circling and whipping 
around as if caught in some makeshift cyclone. When they dissipated...

&quot;Oh, that was fun to watch! Yes, they all died beautifully! Too bad they 
went peacefully... their screaming in pain and anguish turned me on.&quot;

Talim&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;This sickness; this distorted wind around you...
It&#39;s the same aura as the cause of all this!&quot; That made everyone&#39;s
head perk up. Xianghua, who had not even had an opportunity to fight,
had instead retreated with the others. She was perhaps looking for
those who needed immediate medical attention... but whatever
the case, she was not here at the moment.

The demented girl with the oversized chakram hanging carelessly around
her neck clapped her hands in delight, a mad giggle coming from her lips. 
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s good- you&#39;re a sharp one as well as strong. Maybe I should
give you the privilege of dying first? Or maybe the fire-wielder over
there would be die a more spectacular death. Blood and explosions 
everywhere, until the whole ship sinks!&quot;

She seemed all to happy about the ship sinking... it meant more souls
for the twisted blade and its twisted wielder.

Talim raised her weapons in a fighting stance, her eyes narrowing in 
determination. &quot;There will be none of that as long as I stand. If
you must have someone to fight, then I will be your opponent.&quot; Tira
grinned widely as she got into a side stance, her feet positioned
at shoulder width and her chakram held loosely in her hands.

&quot;I wonder how your blood will feel against my skin? I can&#39;t wait
to find out!&quot; With that, she leapt forward, murder on her mind
and madness in her eyes. Not wasting a moment, Talim charged as
well, turning a flip through the air as Tira began her attack, 
rotating the ring blade around her right wrist twice as she lunged.

Talim came down upon the ring blade with her own weapons extended,
and the two of them met on the first rotation, steel meeting steel
in a flurry of sparks.

Once again, the battle was joined!

To Be Continued...
