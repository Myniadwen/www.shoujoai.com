<h1>The Seeds of Evil: Dragon Rising (part 11 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../soulcal/seedsevildr-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Case Subject:

One Chai Xianghua, age 20. Born April 2, 1573 in Peking, China.
The city, later known as Beijing, served as the captital throughout 
the golden age of one of the two most powerful nations in Aisa, 
second only to Japan at the time. Had an alliance with Korea during 
their Seven-Year War, and shared technology and weaponry with them.

As a result, the Seong&#39;s Long Sword school uses mostly weaponry from
Northern China: the jian- a double edged sword; dao- the broadsword;
zhanmadao- long handled broadsword; dadao- greatsword; and the
damaging and dangerous hook sword.

Family has a long and detailed history in the Ming Emperor&#39;s guard 
and martial arts in general. Her own lineage starts with her mother,
Xiangfei, who became extremely skilled with a jian in the art of
Ling-Sheng Su swordplay and tai chi. Indeed, she became so skilled
that she surpassed even the monks with her natural talent for
defending herself.

However, since she was a woman, she was disqualified her from the 
right to bear the Krita-Yuga, a tai chi jian that was part of the 
temple&#39;s Divine Trinity. This concerned her not- she had other
matters in mind. The woman had fallen in love with a monk known
as Kong Xiuqiang, who was the most prominant candidate for
inheritance of the Kali-Yuga.

It was due to his candidacy for inheritance of a sacred artifact
that their love was forbidden, and thus kept secret. It was
kept a secret for quite some time, too... until the birth of a
girl- Xianglian, who would be part of the catastrophe that
befell the temple, and the object of Xianghua&#39;s future distress.

Because of this birth of a bastard child, the two of them would
separate forever, due to Xiangfei&#39;s overwhelming grief. A
man known as Han Dongxiu would protest her leaving, at least
without her love, but Xiuqiang was determined to see his training
through to the end. Understanding his resolve, Xiangfei agreed
with him and prepared to leave.

However, she would recieve a parting gift before she left... the
Krita-Yuga- the very jian she was denied from inheriting due
to her gender. It was a promise that the two of them would meet
again someday... but unfortunately, they would not.

The man had no idea that he had yet another daughter... the 
knowledge of Xianghua herself was kept from him so he would devote 
his time and energy to becoming the successor for the Kali-Yuga.
By the time Xianghua&#39;s birthday rolled around, Xiuqiang was exiled
from the Ling-Sheng Su temple for stealing the Krita-Yuga, and
the sword itself had hidden its true form in order to stay pure
and untainted.

They would *never* find it again during the temple&#39;s lifetime.

By the time Xianghua was old enough to walk, still without the
knowledge of her heritage or family, she had become increasingly
interested in her mother&#39;s art of combat. For the next five years,
she would train diligently and rigorously in order for her skill
to match- even surpass that of her own mother. At the age of ten,
Xiangfei died, the last words coming from her mouth the same
words that drove Xianghua onward.

&quot;You were born to complete an important task... cut your path
through an uncertain future!&quot;

She had little idea of what that task was... yet used the words
as a motivator. For the next six years, she would continue
her training, and by the time she had joined the personal guard
of the Ming emperor she was hailed as a prodigy; a genius with
a tai chi jian in hand.

It was during these first few months that she met someone quite
interesting... a woman who looked like she was from Korea but
who spoke Mandarin as if she were a native. This alone intrigued
her, not to mention her impressive weapon: a six foot long 
zhanmadao with a crimson red rod.

No one carried those anymore... they had been replaced by
changdao, due to the constant raids from Japanese pirates. They
were a countermeasure to the extremely long odachi- Japan&#39;s
long-handled sword. However, the zhanmadao that she wielded
looked... new. Untarnished and unblemished, as if it had
resisted the effects of time. The blade still shone, the wood
looked fresh, the edge looked sharper than anything she had
ever seen.

She had to make sure.

Approaching the woman stealthily, she feinted an attack, just to 
see what her reaction would be. Such a long and unbalanced weapon 
would perhaps be too sluggish to wave around in such a fashion.
Yet to her surprise... the woman flicked the back end of the weapon
upwards with the heel of her right foot as the blade came around to 
the right side of her head, and the attack was stopped cold.

Without her even turning around and looking in Xianghua&#39;s direction.

As the brown haired Korean turned to face her, Xianghua found that
she was no higher than about 5&#39;2&quot; and probably weighed under 
ninety-five pounds. The weapon was roughtly fifteen, perhaps twenty
or thirty pounds heavier than the weilder; how could she possibly 
block her attack, let alone *lift her weapon*? But she had no time 
to comment, for the woman was already on the attack- and with
preternatural speed.

She swung the zhanmadao as if it were made of bamboo or rattan,
and quickly at that. It were as if the weapon were of no concequence
to her at all! She had to use all of her skill to defend herself
from the intense speed of the strikes... not only that, but the
woman possessed one hell of a kick, her legs moving more like
swords and spears than limbs, lashing out with the force of a
cannon.

How could she tell? Well, aside from the woman&#39;s movement speed, 
Xianghua was clipped by one of her side kicks, right against her 
head, and was knocked roughly four feet backwards as her opponent 
advanced with incredible footwork.

In the end, the two of them fought to a draw... and only then, when
their resources were strained to their limits did Xianghua call a
truce and explain herself. Later, after a bit of discussion, a
meeting was arranged in order to meet with the emperor himself.
In a shrewd bid to get this highly talented woman named Seong Mi-na 
working for the empire, she offered the promise of joining the 
emperor&#39;s personal guard. It was an honor bestowed only upon the
elite, and Xianghua had just seen such talent within the Korean.

Long afterwards, after some time of contemplation, Xianghua 
concluded that perhaps it was a predetermined step on the road to 
where they currently were in their relationship.

She accepted the offer not by mere words, but by actually coming
to the emperor&#39;s private residence; unnanounced, of course.
Fortunately, she was greeted with a welcome upon arrival- word
had already spread of the fight between her and Xianghua. Upon
further examination by the emperor himself, he was convinced that
she was adept enough for entry into his personal circle of power.

However, she politely refused, saying that she had only come to
China in order to gather information- nothing more. When it was
asked what kind of information, she began explaining her search
for Soul Edge, but did not mention why she was looking for the
legendary weapon.

It was this statement that led the emperor to include her in
the hunt for the &quot;sword of heroes&quot;, with Xianghua as the leader
of a selection from his own line of highly trained specialists in
the martial arts. In the end, they were accompanied by Kilik,
a former monk from the Ling-Sheng Su, and Maxi, an easygoing
pirate from the Ryukyu islands in Japan.

A few other capable fighters joined the group, and they soon 
became a small army, dedicated to the task of revealing the truth 
behind the Soul Edge for themselves.

Along the way, Xianghua had been told of Mi-na&#39;s adventures and
of the trouble she had countlessly gotten into three years prior
to this latest outing. Instead of taking the tale in contempt,
she had found qualities which appealed to her- the boldness of
her escape from her father&#39;s school, the resolve to complete
her task regardless of whatever obstacles were in her way, the
skill to disarm and defeat her greatest rival, and the will
that just plain wouldn&#39;t be broken, not even by her father.

Not to mention that she was a patriot, much like Xianghua was
devoted to serving her country in whatever way possible. And
she sympathised with Mi-na on a level far greater than even
she herself had expected when told of what she had gone through.
Even here, where women were often proven as warriors of strength 
and courage, some did not want to accept the fact that they stood 
on equal footing to men.

She had not been treated as such, but knew the state of things and
sympathised with her. Combined with a respect, even awe of her
talents and a notice of her beauty, even in the face of such
harsh training and physical exertion, she became far more than
a mere friend.

It came as a shock to Xianghua when she figured out that she could
possibly be in love, and with a woman no less. The only thing that
Xianghua knew for sure was that she wanted Mi-na to succeed; to
be genuinely happy. And that she wanted to do anything within her
power in order to have her friend&#39;s happiness come to fruition.

She just needed to say it out loud... 

It wasn&#39;t until much later, after countless scrapes, close shaves, 
and harrowing battles, that she gathered enough courage to speak 
her mind. Considering all that they had been through, it was time 
to say it before she lost her opportunity forever.

Sensing an opportunity one night as they rested within the
hermitage of an old man known as Edge Master, located within the
Himalayan moutain range between India and China, she made her
move to pour out her heart. It was difficult at first, but the
older woman got the message after only a few stuttered phrases.
She only said five words as a counter:

&quot;I love you too, Xianghua.&quot;

Everything went from there... up until the point where the party 
discovered the true face of Soul Edge. The woman could not rightly
allow such a sword to fall into her country&#39;s possession, much less
anyone else&#39;s! As she saw Mi-na fall in battle, her emotions rose
to the surface, compelling her to run forward in her defense ahead 
of everyone else. Driven by a desire to protect her newfound love,
she battled the azure knight fiercely, matching him blow for blow.

Kilik joined the fray, and with the help of the Dvapara-Yuga, they
conquered the malevolent power of the one known as Nightmare.
Unfortunately, it was not the end... Soul Edge itself came forth,
challenging all within its gaze to combat. Drawing everyone,
including the unconscious Mi-na into its crimson eye, it sought
to devour all existance.

Unharmed, due to the influence of the mirrored sash, she watched
as the very air around them assaulted her companions, enveloping
them in lights of beauty... and consumption. They were immobilized
as their souls were stripped away, helpless to do anything but
watch.

Soon, even Kilik, whose mirrored sash had been weakening
during the fight, came under the influence of the desecration.
As she too felt the effects... something happened. When the
disruptive aura touched her jian, it exploded in a wave of sheer
force and healing potency, the shockwave blasting through
the emptiness as if to quickly fill it with life.

The moment she opened her eyes again, she beheld it. Her weapon
had changed- transformed of its own accord. She looked at it in
wonder at first, not believing that the blade before her eyes was
her mother&#39;s keepsake. It had a light blue tint to it- an aura of
calming and peace radiated from the otherworldly steel.

In awe, she reached out to claim it... and heard her mother&#39;s
voice. (This is the moment,) it said, the voice hasty and urgent.
(Take hold of your destiny, and your future! Quickly- the enemy
comes!) No longer doubting that the weapon belonged to her mother,
and now her, she took the sword in her left hand. Her vision
cleared just as the malevolent spirit was one foot in front of
her person. Xianghua raised her weapon in defense, almost too 
late...

And then her eyes widened as the creature was knocked away by
a blurred figure, the glint of a blade flashing briefly before
the attack. And was that... heat and fire coming from the
weapon? She looked to her right and saw Seong Mi-na standing
next to her with the zhanmadao held diagonally to the ground
as if in completion of a technique.

The movement was so fast, not even Xianghua&#39;s vision could track it.

&quot;Well, don&#39;t just stand there- let&#39;s get this done!&quot;

With a resolved nod, they both charged the enemy simultaneously,
working in concert to defeat the evil. Xianghua dealt the final
blow and the darkness was shattered, as was the Dvapara-Yuga
in the process. Not only that, but it seemed that Mi-na&#39;s will
had finally been broken... she broke down and burst into tears
soon after the battle was over, pleading for someone- anyone
to come and finish her off. To make the screams stop.

For the next few months, Xianghua became Mi-na&#39;s support, lending
her aid when she needed it, and in the process explaining about
her own self, telling stories of her childhood and her first few
months in the Imperial Guards. The bond between the two was deepened
and strengthened during this time, so it was a sad thing when she
finally had to leave for China again.

Sadder still... was the news that she conveyed to the emperor that
they had failed to find the Soul Edge. Due to this, she fell out
of favor and was given a demeaning, menial position. She cared not
about this, however- she was content that the evil had been
destroyed.

Or so she thought...

For the next four years, life settled into a lull for her. She
wrote often to her love to see how she was faring, trained
diligently in her swordplay, and visited her family from time
to time, although their record of flawless service and within the 
Chai family had been tarnished.

More disturbing to Xianghua however, was the fact that she had lost
her mother&#39;s keepsake sword. That beautiful blade of a pale blue
was lost in the void, presumably forever. On top of that, she
wanted to convey her feelings about Mi-na to Kilik, for she thought
that he could be trusted with such knowledge. However, he shunned
it, saying that such things were not befitting of someone who
weilded a divine artifact.

She didn&#39;t speak to him for months, giving him more scars than he
could account for from the destruction of the temple before she went
silent on him. Edge Master had to heal him for days before resuming
his training sessions with the young man.

The peaceful interlude was shattered as an attack was declared on 
Xiwei castle, just on the outer fringe of the Ming empire&#39;s western 
border. According to the scouts, the lords had Soul Edge hidden 
there and were withholding it from them. The first scouting party 
had been slain in the process, with just a few escaping to tell the 
tale. The attack was swift and devastating, and the castle walls and
main palace were in ruins.

Xianghua was sent to investigate... and found that among the rubble,
there were pieces of Soul Edge- the very sword that she figured she
had destroyed! If they were the cause behind this madness, as well
as the emperor&#39;s own fervor...

She sent a final letter to Seong Mi-na before heading off on her own
quest, without explaining to her where she was going or what she was
doing. She had to bear this burden on her own, without interrupting
her lover&#39;s training and mental cleansing. Soon, she ran into Kilik,
who was on a journey of his own in order to resolve his own situation.

The two continued arguing about Mi-na for quite a while during their
journey, but mostly got along for the duration. However, their
adventure was cut short as they entered the west- specificly the
country of France. An entire region was under the command of some
dark lord- they had to stop and cleanse a village of the evil 
influence that had been bestowed upon it.

Using the Dvapara-Yuga shard around Kilik&#39;s neck, they had
sucessfully cleared the minds of the villagers... and then, *he* came.
A dark-skinned man wearing white and carrying a massive scythe. His
aura was immense, as if the man had lived for centuries.

&quot;Leave, now. Evil will spread through this place like wildfire, and 
your efforts will be in vain if you do not escape immediately.&quot;

Xianghua was frozen in fear for some inexplicable reason. This man...
he terrified her to a level which she could not explain. An ancient,
forceful presence that overwhelmed hers completely and shattered her
resolve, even before she could draw her weapon.

She could do nothing but watch as Kilik was beaten senseless by the
terrible power of the man with the scythe, who moved as if he were
a living, breathing maelstrom- swift, devastating, and damned fast,
even with such a large weapon. She was completely ignored by the man
as he walked away...

But then, he stopped and spoke, his back still turned.

&quot;You can&#39;t defeat me yet; it is unwise to try,&quot; he said as if he
were reading her thoughts. Perhaps he was. &quot;But pay it no mind, for
the moment. You will soon regain your strength... and your treasure. 
Use it well.&quot; With that, he vanished.

She could do nothing to stop him; nothing to help Kilik. Overwhelmed
by her emotions, she fainted soon after...

Raised back to consciousness by the very people whom they had saved,
she noticed that Kilik&#39;s wounds had not recovered, nor had he opened
his eyes. Disturbed and frantic, she asked for help in bringing him
back to the Himalayas, for she had no real idea of any family that the
man had, save for the one called Edge Master.

As she carried him into the hermitage, she left a letter adressed to
him that she would get stronger and more proficient in whatever she
needed to know. But she did not include in that letter that one of
her sources of strength... would be Mi-na herself.


With that, and after extensive training for two full months, she
was prepared to leave again. And the first person she would request
aid from?

Her lover and best friend, Seong Mi-na.

However, as she prepared to leave for Korea... she found something
in her travel bag. Withdrawing it from the folds of her clothing,
she discovered that it was her mother&#39;s weapon, still the beat up
old jian that she had wielded before.

What did this mean? When did it come back to her? And why was it
here now of all places? Did it somehow sense that it was needed?
Was it sentient, like Soul Edge was? The man&#39;s words echoed through
her mind as she considered the situation- he had foretold of this
happenning. Not only that, but she felt that her training was also
part of his prediction.

&quot;You will soon regain your strength...&quot;

So many questions to awnser- so little time to do so. She had
to get moving and make contact with Mi-na as soon as she could!

Chapter 11- Shadow War (Part 4)
________________________________________________________________________

Xianghua was busy enjoying the scenery of the shrine- and also making
an attempt to cope with the recent discovery of a dead sister that she
had never been told about. If there were one thing that she had learned
about lying, it was that it never got anyone anything good, even if
the one who lied meant well for all involved.

Better to tell the truth than to cause trouble in the end.

(My mother hid all this from me,) she said, deep in thought. (So that
means that my father could still be alive somewhere, though my sister
is not. But why did she not let me know, even when she died? It would
have been a perfect time, though I wouldn&#39;t know how I would have
handled it...)

By the time she was finished with that thought, her eyes were furrowed
in frustration. She could have done something to stop these events from
happenning- said something to her family in order to make contact with
her sister. It was only after a while that she figured the anger was
pointless. Her mother was dead, her father was missing somewhere, and
her sister was lost to the void long before she had the skills that
she had now.

Little by little, she calmed down. (I&#39;m glad I had that training,) she
said to herself as her frantic steps slowed to an even pace again. (I
don&#39;t know what I would have done- maybe I&#39;d have attacked someone just
to vent.) It was possible; she certainly felt like kicking something
a few moments ago, and kicking hard.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter,&quot; a young voice piped up behind her. &quot;You seem a bit
stressed still, miss Xianghua.&quot; She turned slowly to regard the young
thirteen year old with black hair, equally black eyes, and a calm gait
about him that seemed a bit too practiced for a child his age. She
smiled and shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m fine now; but thanks for being so
concerned.&quot;

The boy grinned, and it were as if a light had been turned on. She
couldn&#39;t help but grin as well; it was infectious. The boy had charisma
flowing from him almost in waves that she could feel, just like Mi-na.

&quot;Say,&quot; he said as he walked alongside the former Imperial Guard,
&quot;I was meaning to ask you what you wanted to learn while you were here.
After all, in order to have you a part of the clan, however temporary,
you have to learn how to act like one of us.&quot; Xianghua didn&#39;t consider
that entirely, and had to think for a moment. Then, she shrugged and
smiled, entirely clueless.

&quot;I have no idea about the first thing to learn- all I have are my 
skills. But I sure can put on a good show, that&#39;s for sure. Does that 
help?&quot; The young man nodded. &quot;Oh, yeah; definitely. I know just what
you need. But first, introductions. The name&#39;s Kageboushi...&quot;
________________________________________________________________________

The second day of meetings and planning. Taki was quickly getting used
to this sort of thing, her natural ability to adapt to her situation
and surroundings coming into play. More and more time was spent with
Kishiumi as the two of them began to relax and get aquainted with one
another. She explained that there was a shinto shrine that was
dedicated to just water spirits. She was the daughter of one of the
priestesses, and wore the standard blue hakama and kimono, both of
which were intricate silk.

It became the clothes which she wore around the Fu-Ma when she had
her entire temple and everyon within it decimated by bandits and 
brigands who happened to get their hands on some rifles. When it 
happened, she was still at the young age of eight; she has loathed the 
weapons ever since, but it was the only hatred she had come to harbor.

She served as mostly a healer and a support for the Fu-Ma on occasion,
throwing out a spell to clear the mind and defend the body now and
then. Her knowledge of herbal medicines and first aid were, as of
recent times, unmatched. Not to mention that her mastery of sui-ren,
the techniques and skills involving water, was her specialty. If there 
were a body of water around, she could sense it from a good mile away-
she even had the rumored spiritual ability to command these waters
and shape them to her will.

She could also profess to be well-trained in staff, spear, and naginata
combat, making her a formidable opponent during extreme situations.
Taki was notably impressed, but her face showed nothing. Expecting
as such, all that Kishiumi did was smile. &quot;You certainly try and keep
your emotions within you most of the time, don&#39;t you?&quot;

Taki nodded. &quot;When in doubt, think with your head instead of the heart-
such matters will keep you alive.&quot; The younger woman, though not much
younger for she was only age 23, giggled at this. &quot;Is that so? And
what if there is a time when you are not threatened?&quot; Taki looked over
at the miko, quirking one of her eyebrows as she did so.

&quot;Is this some kind of test or game? Are you trying to provoke a
reaction from me in some way?&quot; Kishiumi laughed again, and it was the
sound of crystal bells chiming in harmony. &quot;No, no. You&#39;re looking at
it subjectively; think of it in an objective light. Consider it as 
only a question- nothing more.&quot;

She did so... and found that she had an easy awnser. Easy, but one 
that she would not admit to so readily. &quot;I... I don&#39;t know what
I would do,&quot; she finally said, a bit of discomfort seeping into her
voice. Somewhere within her subconscious, she smirked. The woman had
evoked a reaction, even without Taki&#39;s knowledge; it was a damn good
ploy, and she had fallen for it.

Kishiumi placed her left hand on Taki&#39;s right shoulder, and
as if it were some kind of balm, Taki&#39;s unease went away almost
immediately. It was unfamilliar, and a bit disorienting at first,
but she did not comment.

&quot;There; is that better? You can rely on me until you find the awnser,
all right?&quot; Taki looked over at her and nodded. She most definitely
needed help when it came to things like expressing herself in more
than just combat, though she did have a bit of help in that matter
on her last few journeys. But it wasn&#39;t like she was going to
spill everything to this woman- at least, not yet.

&quot;So then,&quot; Taki began speaking after she had gotten used to the
aura of calm that had seeped through her, &quot;What is the status of
the mission that I had sent the councilman on?&quot; Kishiumi sighed
and shook her head. &quot;No dice yet- Chie and Hachibei are difficult to
find these days. You were correct in the fact that not even your own
information network could get a hold of them. However, the search will
continue for as long as it takes.&quot;

(That is,) Taki thought to herself, (Until they find them, either 
alive or dead. I pray that the second one has not happened just yet,
I would love to see my friends just once more before my life ended,
if only to apologize for what I have put them through.)

With that thought in mind, Taki nodded. &quot;Send him a message that
no stone should be left unturned and no lead unchecked. I want them
found as quickly as possible before we do anything else as far as
dealing with our rival faction.&quot; Immediately recognizing the note
of command in Taki&#39;s voice, Kishiumi bowed deeply and hurried off,
her body blurring with the speed of her retreat.

(Thank you, Kishiumi... for everything.) The kunoichi in red
continued her silent walk alone.
________________________________________________________________________

The art of disguise and impersonation, hensojutsu, fit Xianghua well,
just like Kageboushi had said. In the three days that she had to learn
everything she would need to know on the subject, she had a good time
doing it. Being in an opera troupe of sorts during her time within the
emperor&#39;s personal guards gave her a natural advantage, though learning
the languages that it would take in order to fully become someone else
would take a much longer time- a few months, perhaps a few years for
each.

But that was later- for now, she had learned the basics of how to
dress and act as anyone, anywhere- all she had to do was observe, 
remember, copy, and retain her disguise and the role she was to play for 
as long as she could. It seemed all too easy, until one considered the 
things that one would be forced to do if they played their part... 
a bit too well.

One had to remain detached and disconnected so that they would not
be compromised- it was the essence of a spy and infiltrator to have
this unemotional trait. One had to let things pass through instead
of harboring them in their heart and mind... &quot;Do you know how to do
that,&quot; he said with a curious expression. &quot;I mean, I haven&#39;t really
asked you that, so before we finish, I guess I should ask now.&quot;

She shrugged, her face a warm smile. She radiated nothing but calm-
an emptiness almost. Suddenly, he couldn&#39;t read her body movements
anymore... (What? When did she-) The confusion on his face was evident,
and Xianghua almost laughed. &quot;Does that awnser your question?&quot; The
boy calmed himself and nodded, smiling his own smile, though it was
one of satisfaction. &quot;Yeah, it pretty much does. I don&#39;t have to
teach you much of anything anymore- now that you know the basics, the
rest is up to you.&quot;

Xianghua bowed to him, and said &quot;Thank you for everything. I know that
three days won&#39;t nearly be enough, but thanks anyway. I really
appreciate this chance to prove myself worthy.&quot; The young man nodded
as his smile widened to a genuinely happy grin. &quot;Hey, no worries!
Besides, you guys mean well and really want to help- I can tell just
by looking at you. As long as it does some good, I&#39;m all for it.&quot;

Xianghua nodded. &quot;Yeah... me too...&quot;

To Be Continued...
