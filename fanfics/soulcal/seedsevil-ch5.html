<h1>The Seeds of Evil: Phoenix Rising (part 5 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../soulcal/seedsevil-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Unbraided brown hair that reached to the small of her back. A crimson 
cloak that hung to her ankles with a hood, lined with gold and bearing 
the Seung dragon on the back. Brown eyes that shone as if something 
wihin had been awakened. And a zanbatoh with a red rod that seemed to 
wink and sparkle in the sunlight, as if it were newly forged.

To top it all off, the nation&#39;s hero was slung over her shoulder, with 
bruises everywhere.

The woman that seemed to be age 23 had hidden herself well from the 
place in which she now stood in front of, though search teams had been 
sent from corner to corner, and country to country. Even the young Hong 
Yunsung had often joined these teams, grumbling about babysitting such a 
spoiled brat.

If only he knew what she had become now.

She opened the gates, and watched as the students trained diligently, 
none of them paying any attention to her at all. Another search team had 
been organized, and was about to go out and search for her. She smirked. 
After looking for four years, her father had not given up, knowing that 
if she truly wanted to be hidden, then she would hide.

She had only been unlucky in the fact that Hwang had found her on her 
way back home, and tried to force her to go with him. Again. The 
situation was no different than last time.

&quot;So, you want me to come with you? Then do so by force.&quot;

Frustrated, he drew his sword and advanced, determined to bring her 
back, and make sure that she stayed there. Imagine his surprise when the 
side of his face had a meeting with the grind ridge of Mina&#39;s 22&quot; blade. 
Several times. As if he were being slapped and scolded for saying 
something rude.

No, it would no longer be so easy to drag her back home.

As the battle raged, he was wearing down. For the first time in all 
their conflicts against one another, she matched him- strike for strike, 
blow for blow. The new speed and grace that she had aquired, even with 
such a large weapon, was uncanny. She weilded the zanbatoh as if it were 
a bamboo pole, and he recieved nary a cut, but tons of bruises.

She remained untouched.

&quot;Hmph. You&#39;re out of your league, Hwang. Go back to your navy for all I 
care. They can&#39;t handle me anymore. But just as a consolation prize, I&#39;m 
going back home. Not for you, and not for father. Just to show, once and 
for all, that I am no longer to be underestimated. And just as proof, 
you&#39;re coming with me.&quot;

Oh, how the tables had turned.

-Chapter 5: The Scarlet Thunder
________________________________________________________________________

Mina heard every word. Her zanbatoh was a Divine Treasure... and she was 
one of the keys to the end of this world. However, she could not accept 
it. &quot;Can&#39;t be... those weapons choose their masters, right? So when did 
it choose me? And why? I&#39;m nothing special! I don&#39;t even deserve to 
carry it.&quot; Xian calmly explained the conditions. &quot;You have to be pure of 
heart, for one.&quot;

Mina scoffed at this. &quot;You mean perfect and innocent? Well I&#39;m not, nor 
do I claim to be. I wouldn&#39;t be so vain.&quot; Xianghua smiled. &quot;Exactly. One 
doesn&#39;t even have to be perfect. Having a pure heart means having good 
intentions and benevolence. Just being nice to people in general, 
y&#39;know?&quot;

For some reason, this made sense. But there seemed to be something else. 
Something that she felt within the weapon itself, and it wasn&#39;t her. It 
was a feeling, an intensity.

She asked again. &quot;That&#39;s nice, but what else? Do you know anything at 
all?&quot; Xian had to think, then came up with something. &quot;Okay then, tell 
me what you felt last night.&quot; Mina was puzzled. &quot;Don&#39;t you know? The 
bond between us is supposed to work like that.&quot; Xianghua nodded. &quot;Of 
course. But I need to hear it from you.&quot;

Mina sighed and began explaining what ran through her mind at the 
massacre of the town, which she still felt guilty about, though it was 
the only way. &quot;I felt angry. This was my town- my country. It was an act 
of war in the highest degree possible, and I couldn&#39;t stand it. I could 
feel their minds being polluted and changed, Xian. It sickened me.&quot;

She sat silently while Mina continued. &quot;I was sad as well, about what I 
had to do in order to free them. I was going to be responsible for the 
death of an entire town- one that I had grown up in, at that. All those 
people had known me in one way or another- some had respected me and 
seen me in the way I had wanted to be seen. And I killed them. So no, I 
don&#39;t think I&#39;m worthy to carry this weapon that you speak of.&quot;
________________________________________________________________________

Xian had a solemn expression on her face as she looked into Mina&#39;s eyes, 
brown meeting brown. &quot;You did what you had to, Mina. Nothing more or 
less. And those feelings are not a bad thing. The Scarlet Thunder picked 
up on those feelings, and awnsered their call. That wasn&#39;t anger or 
wanton destruction, Mina. That was passion. I think that&#39;s what 
triggered the change.&quot;

Now, Mina was the one who was silent. Passion... to explain it like 
that, it made perfect sense. &quot;And what&#39;s more is, you&#39;ve grown stronger, 
much stronger. I can feel it, even now. You have it within you to use 
it, Mina!&quot; But she felt no such change or power within her. At least, 
not anymore.

Mina shook her head and said &quot;Forget it. I can&#39;t be the one.&quot; Xian&#39;s 
expression was of concern. &quot;Do you really doubt yourself that much? Even 
after you&#39;ve come this far?&quot; Yes... there was that. Her journey. In her 
last two outings, she learned much. And over time, she could almost feel 
herself growing stronger from within. &#39;Maybe... but still, am I really 
that strong?&#39; &quot;I still don&#39;t know, Xian.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll prove it to you, then.&quot;

The young woman focused some of her energy to her right hand. Mina was a 
little frightened at this, and showed it. &quot;And just how are you going to 
do that?&quot; With her eyes still closed, she replied &quot;I&#39;ll bring the energy 
within you to the surface. Then you&#39;ll see just how strong you&#39;ve 
become.&quot; An blue aura of energy was now glowing from her hand. &quot;That&#39;s 
enough. Now, try to relax. This is gonna feel a little strange...&quot;

She placed her hand on her friend&#39;s shoulder, and with a gentle squeeze, 
channeled her stored energy through her. For a while, nothing happened. 
&quot;You see?&quot; Mina said with a sigh, &quot;There&#39;s no... such...&quot; She felt it. A 
warm, glowing sensation within her. Her aura was beginning to flare 
up... and it did so with a vengance. But this was much different from 
the night before... this was power. A power that had been sleeping 
within her for years... and now that it was revealed, it proved to be 
overwhelming.

But still, she wanted more... so she willed her new strength to go 
farther. And, as if it were waiting for a sign, her aura quickly 
increased in size. Mina laughed. &quot;This is my power, huh?&quot; Xian smiled. 
&quot;Yes. This is the strength of your soul. I told you, didn&#39;t I?&quot; &quot;Yeah, 
you did. And it was so easy... all I had to do was call for it, and it 
came, just like that.&quot; Xian was serious again. &quot;Yeah. And that&#39;s why 
you, and anyone else who knows how to use spiritual energy, need to have 
limits. Like now, for instance.&quot;

Mina was a little disheartened, but agreed. &quot;You&#39;re right. I guess this 
power doesn&#39;t last forever.&quot; She closed her eyes, and the aura died 
down. &#39;Such control... maybe she knows how to do this already.&#39; &quot;Hey, 
how much do you know about spiritual energy, anyway?&quot; Xian asked.

&quot;Oh, I know a lot of things. An old guy named Edge Master taught me.&quot; 
Xian was awed at this latest revelation. &quot;Edge Master? THE Edge Master? 
But he&#39;s the advisor for the Ling Sheng Su temple! So how...&quot; &quot;Hey, 
Don&#39;t ask me. It was his idea. Guess he saw the same things you&#39;re 
seeing now.&quot; &#39;Even I haven&#39;t been personally trained by him. She must 
know more than she&#39;s letting on.&#39; Xian decided to go further into her 
questions.

&quot;So... what else have you learned from him?&quot; It seemed strange to Mina 
that her friend was so curious about an old hermit. But she indulged 
her. &quot;Well, as you know, I know Ling Sheng Su rod arts, right? But I 
didn&#39;t really know EVERYTHING. So, along with the stuff about the soul 
and whatnot, I finished my rod arts traini-&quot;

She could sense the attack before it was even started. Her body reacted 
without thought, as if it remembered the training that had been beaten 
into it. Almost instanly, she split her legs apart and let the 
horizontal slash from Xianghua pass neatly over her head. &quot;You&#39;re just 
as bad as father, you know that?&quot; gasped Mina as she got up. Xian was 
once again speechless.

&#39;Just like that... she avoided my attack! It&#39;s as if she were never 
there in the first place!&#39; Mina continued her story. &quot;Now, where was 
I... oh, right. I finished my rod arts training, and found out that the 
things I&#39;d learned about spiritual energy tied in with my training. So I 
made a few of my own techniques that mixed the Long Blade with the rod 
arts.&quot;

And then she finished with &quot;Thats about all I know. But I&#39;m surprised 
that you don&#39;t know anything about him. After all, you practice the 
Sheng temple sword arts, right?&quot; Xian shook her head. &quot;Oh no, my mother 
taught me that. But she mever told me that those were the temple arts!&quot; 
Mina was curious about that. In fact, she didn&#39;t know much about Xian&#39;s 
mother.

&quot;Well, why not?&quot; &#39;Because she... she passed away.&#39; This brought her much 
discomfort, so she said &quot;Enough talk about family. We should forget 
about all that for now, right?&quot; Mina was resolved to ask about her 
friend&#39;s family, but she refrained from doing so for now. &quot;All right. 
Now tell me more about this Divine Treasure that you think I have.&quot;
________________________________________________________________________

Mina now had her weapon in hand. &quot;All right. Now, just do what comes 
naturally to you.&quot; Mina nodded, and steeled herself for what was to 
come. She took a deep, slow breath, and willed her soul to action. As 
soon as she felt her energy begin to flow, she gripped her weapon 
tighter, which channeled her energies through the Scarlet Thunder.

Almost instantly, a force went through her weapon and an aura of power 
pulsed from the blade. Then, as if it had burst itno flames, a red light 
shone from the zanbatoh. And as the light faded, Mina gasped in awe. The 
Divine Treasure had gone through the facelift that it had undergone the 
night before..

The rod was lined with a golden pattern, much like Kilik&#39;s. The base of 
the blade now had the head of a Chinese dragon, like Hwang&#39;s Blue 
Thunder. And, as if to make the dragon come alive, the blade had shaped 
itself into the blade of a kwan dao, looking very much as if the dragon 
were spitting fire.

Xianghua was still in awe at the transformation. &quot;It&#39;s beautiful,&quot; said 
Xian, who was obviously impressed. Mina however, was a little angry. 
&quot;But... it looks like Hwang&#39;s. Why does everything remind me of him?&quot; 
&quot;But this is your soul&#39;s vision, not your mind&#39;s. Look-&quot; Reluctantly, 
she did so.... and she saw her entire life in the design. The dragon was 
the family crest... the design on the rod was the same one that was 
found in the temple... and the blade represented the fires of her soul, 
which, more often than not, had given her strength where there was none.

&quot;You&#39;re right... absolutely right, Xian. This is the way I wanted my 
weapon. And I didn&#39;t even know it!&quot; Xian smiled. &quot;See, I told you! Now, 
try it out.&quot; Mina had forgotten all about that. &quot;Sure, but I&#39;ll have to 
wait until my energy comes back.&quot; &#39;She DOES know a lot.&#39; Xian shook her 
head and said &quot;No, go ahead.&quot;

Mina&#39;s eyes widened at this. &quot;But, I won&#39;t even be able to lift it, 
right?&quot; &quot;Yeah, because you&#39;ve used a lot of energy. But try it anyway.&quot; 
Mina still had doubts. &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Xian placed her hand on Mina&#39;s 
shoulder and smiled. &quot;Trust me...&quot; And so, with a shrug of her 
shoulders, she lifted the weapon.

Whatever she excpected, it wasn&#39;t this. The usually weighty zanbatoh had 
turned into a feather. &#39;It&#39;s almost like I&#39;m holding the air!&#39; &quot;What&#39;s 
this about?&quot; Xian laughed. &quot;Now try it on this tree.&quot; Mina no longer 
doubted Xian&#39;s word. &quot;Sure. Better stand back, though.&quot; As her young 
companion did so, Mina still marveled at the weight of the weapon. &#39;It 
can&#39;t be that useful at this weight...&#39; She swiped at the tree... and 
the blade padded cleanly through, as if there were nothing there! After 
a few seconds, the tree fell.

&quot;How is this possible? With all the energy I used to change it-&quot; &quot;It 
should be impossibe to lift, right. And am I right in assuming that you 
think it&#39;s the weapon?&quot; Mina just nodded.

&quot;Well, it is the weapon, but not in the way you think. See, as soon as 
you channeled your soul through the Scarlet Thunder, you normally 
would&#39;ve been drained. But when these weapons recieve a gift, they give 
one back. In exchange for the energy you gave, you get an incredible 
strength... go ahead, try something that you don&#39;t think you can 
normally do!&quot; Mina knew exactly what she wanted.

She bent her knees, and for the first time, felt the new strength flow 
through them, as if she had been born again. &#39;Here goes nothing!&#39; She 
jumped... and found herself soaring through the air! when she finally 
slowed down, Xian was MUCH smaller, even though Mina could still 
recognize her. She floated in mid-air, as if she were defying the 
earth&#39;s pull. But much greater than these was the sensation that she 
felt, the emotions that raced through her being.

&#39;Freedom... I feel so free right now. And I&#39;m not afraid... of 
anything.&#39; And even as gravity began to take hold once again, she had no 
fear. As she was about to slam into the ground, Mina bent her knees on 
touch down, and felt nothing.

&quot;See now? You are worthy.&quot; Mina wasn&#39;t surprised anymore, but rather at 
peace. &quot;Yeah. I see. And I know what I have to do with what I&#39;ve been 
given.&quot; Xian nodded. &quot;Then let&#39;s stop wasting time. We&#39;ll take the next 
ship out, which is at sunset.&quot; Mina had chosen her path. &#39;I won&#39;t stop 
until all six souls are safe! And I&#39;ll get rid of anyone and anything in 
the way!&#39;
________________________________________________________________________

Sunset at the docks. The two women boarded the boat with the other 
passengers- most of them the people that Xian had saved- and headed out. 
But they didn&#39;t do that without saying goodbye to the town. &quot;I won&#39;t 
forget the times that I had here.&quot; Xianghua agreed. &quot;There&#39;s a lot of 
words and feelings here. Can&#39;t you feel it, Mina?&quot; &quot;Yes. I won&#39;t pretend 
that I&#39;m not angry. But I won&#39;t let this stop me anymore...&quot; Indeed, she 
could feel the wandering souls. And she said farewell...

To her surprise, they awnsered with a very loud and heart-filled 
goodbye. Xian smiled. &quot;See? Be at peace now. They did care, despite your 
faults.&quot; Mina tried to hold back her tears as she looked toward Seung 
Mountain.

She failed miserably, and turned to the boat with a vow in her head.

&#39;I&#39;ll come back, father... and stronger than ever!&#39;

All right! I did it! So, how is it so far? Obviously, this is my little 
take on the Seung Treasures. Remember, if anyone has any comments, you 
know where I&#39;m at!
