<pre>Chapter One: Embracing Fate 

********** 

Sophitia. 

I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been nearly six years. Six years since I last laid 
eyes upon her. In my heart... it feels like only a day has passed since 
I first met her. I... I still yearn for her... but why? Why can&#39;t I 
embrace my life without her? 

Then again... after the effect she had on my life in general... I doubt 
that I&#39;d ever be able to let her go. And as much as it makes me... 
uncomfortable to speak of my feelings like this, I do not deny what she 
means (meant) to me. 

At present, I train hard at my secluded sanctuary of operations. It 
suits my needs. The lake across the grass fields is needed for my 
training. As is the southern cave and the bamboo forests I frequently 
visit. I have to work hard, if I do not, then the strength of the 
demons I pursue will eventually start overpowering me. So I train and 
fight, fight and train. The monotony of it all does bear itself to me. 
I am not oblivious to it. But that is my life. That is what I exist 
for... to travel Japan and destroy demons, those that plague the 
countryside. 

It&#39;s as my destiny demands. 

Yet, why could Sophitia see that? 

Humph. It&#39;s ironic. It was through battling demons that I discovered 
Rekkimaru&#39;s weakening. And it was through Rekkimaru&#39;s weakening that I 
found her. 

On that day, so many years ago... 

********** 

Nagato Kyuuden, Chugoku Region, Japan 

A furious wind blew in from the west. The western winds poured through 
the quiet trees of Utsume forest, disturbing quiet and peaceful 
animals, and rustling up stray twigs and blades of grass. The vast 
forest of Utsume surrounded the equally large castle of Nagato, the 
main stronghold of that area. Though the castle was great in size, it 
had been abandoned at least three months ago. The powerful owner, the 
current daimyo of the area, had purchased this from the shogun, as a 
trade-off for loyalty during the wars. 

Little did that lord know that spirits of evil had invaded Nagato 
Kyuuden 20-years prior. Not even the proud bushi, loyal to the daimyo 
with their lives, dared to stand against the creature that was lurking 
within the castle&#39;s mighty walls. After the deaths of over 20 samurai, 
the daimyo and his forces evacuated the building with the utmost 
urgency, taking with them all of their sacred treasures, lest they be 
stolen by rogue vagrants or thieves. 

Nagato Kyuuden, a once proud castle of the Chugoku region, had been 
abandoned. Leaving the demon of the castle to roam free within its 
innards, haunting the place with its evil presence. Though regular 
people showed their backs to monsters such as the demon of Nagato 
Kyuuden, others were not so cowardly. There were people, blessed with 
divine gifts from above, that dedicated their lives to the pursuit of 
evil, unworldly forces. 

One of those said people happened to be traversing the path that led to 
the castle, through the woods. This woman stalked proudly through the 
trees, leaping from branch to branch, darting past the birds that took 
flight in an opposite direction, a direction that led away from the 
castle. This proud kunoichi bore the sleek attire of a user of the 
night, her tight clothes and thin plates of shin and wrist armour did 
nothing to weigh her down. Or hide the great legacy that she had. This 
young woman was known to the few as &#39;Taki&#39; one of a small number of 
demon hunters. Taki was by all accounts a rare case. Orphaned as a 
child, she was raised in a secretive clan of ninja, brought up to be 
one of its most accomplished members. She had been trained in the 
dream-slashed style of kenjutsu, and had come to be experienced with 
all sorts of weaponry, though she had a preference for one, the 
wakizashi. 

Of this type of sword, she had fashioned her own personal favourite, 
the handcrafted blade lovingly dubbed as &#39;Rekkimaru&#39;. With Rekkimaru at 
her side, her ninja skills in her fists, and her supernatural abilities 
at within her soul, Taki the demon huntress was a force to be reckoned 
with. As Taki landed on a new branch, she crouched silently and stared 
up into the night sky. The birds were fleeing so abruptly. She held up 
her hand and narrowed her eyes. In a brief few seconds, a small bird 
landed on it. 

Taki could read its feelings. &quot;You can feel the evil too. It must be 
sealed soon.&quot; 


The ninja girl let the bird fly away, and then rolled her eyes over to 
the castle again. A black, horrible aura surrounded the place. It had 
to be fairly strong. Slowly, Taki shut her eyes and let her focus on 
her location drop. She channelled herself and then turned her mind&#39;s 
eye to Nagato Kyuuden. Like a sickly feeling in her stomach, the dark 
presence was impossible to ignore. From the feel of it, the beast was 
currently stalking around the higher levels of the castle. Which meant 
that it might be a little easier to reach it. 

&quot;I need to move swiftly.&quot; Taki thought as she leapt up from the tree 
branch, up into the higher growth and foliage of the trees. 
The ninja jumped from tree to tree in that shadowy pace once more, 
inching closer to the stronghold containing the demon. Before long she 
reached the main outer wall of Nagato Kyuuden. The wall stood at a 
might height of about twenty feet, around one foot in width. The tree 
that Taki was standing on was not tall enough for her to jump up from, 
but another nearby tree might just do the trick. 

Taki focused herself, jumped across the divide between the tree of her 
position and the tree of her needs. As she reached the second tree, she 
bounded off it instantly with both feet, giving her enough momentum to 
vault over the castle wall. Taki stared down beneath her as she 
descended the wall and saw that she was about to land on an abandoned 
hey cart. The cart shuddered as Taki landed on it, but did not break. 
Luckily something had been there to massage the force of the fall. Now 
she was inside the castle walls. 

Taki hopped off the cart of hey, dusting off her attire, and then 
studied the grounds. Though she was in the castle&#39;s vicinity, she was 
still outside in the main courtyard. From the carts of hey and old bags 
of rice, it was obvious that this part of the fortress was used to hold 
goods which would be transported inside. Which also meant that there 
was an entrance somewhere nearby. Narrowed eyes darted from side to 
side, in the hopes of finding this entrance, which she did, but not 
with the results she had hoped for. 

Taki sighed. The door inside had been smashed apart, and the doorway 
had been boarded up, some wooden boxes and bricks were packed against 
the door, most likely to block out thieves. Though the daimyo of this 
castle was bound to have taken most of his prized belongings, there 
must have been a few more remaining treasures they wanted to keep safe, 
lest he return. Taki really couldn&#39;t care less about a daimyo&#39;s need to 
protect his interests, but this changed everything. Now there was no 
clear, sure-fire way to get inside. 

&quot;Damn.&quot; Taki cursed. &quot;Now how will in get inside this place?&quot; 


After a few moments to think about it, Taki gazed upwards. The castle 
looked more or less scalable from the outside. It might take a bit 
longer, but that seemed to be the only way. The 22-year-old woman 
darted across the stone ground of the outer yard, crossing over to the 
main building. She came to the walls of the building, placing one hand 
against the wall. Another followed this hand, and soon both of her feet 
were off the ground, attached to the wall. Taki slowly began climbing 
up the castle to reach the top. The woman climbed up the wall like a 
spider, slowly but surely pacing over stone with sequential skill. It 
would normally be a strenuous task for others, but for Taki it was a 
drop in the bucket. Whenever she was tested by the darkness of a demon 
or a restless spirit, Taki would always rise up to new levels of 
strength and surpass herself. As Taki climbed on, she reached the 
extended roof of the ground floor&#39;s ceiling. She scuttled around the 
inner arch of the roof, and pulled herself above it, finally reaching 
some vertically based tiling. Taki ran across the roof and over to the 
wall of the second floor, once again climbing upward. 

She repeated this process, again and again, until she reached the final 
roof, the highest point of the castle. Taki stood upwards as she wiped 
a trail of sweat from her forehead, the strong west wind whipping up 
her ponytail of dancing black hair. The castle was very tall; in fact 
Taki could see the landscape in all its glory, and the surrounding 
forest being besieged by the winds. Still, this was not the time for 
her to be enjoying the view. Taki let herself fall out of focus again, 
shutting her eyes and concentrating hard. Taki focused her power on her 
left fist, one that she had spread out into an open palm position. All 
of her secret training allowed this, her focus unparalleled. 

&quot;Yaah!&quot; With that petite, feminine scream, Taki thrust her palmed hand 
at the roof of the castle, ancient energies instilled in it. The blow 
shattered the ageing materials that formed the roof, blowing open a 
three foot long hole into the building. Finally, an entrance was 
available. 

The fearless Taki jumped down into the castle, through the hole she had 
just created, and landed in the main room, the one-room palace of the 
daimyo. Taki&#39;s dark eyes locked on her location. The room was large, 
decorated richly with scripts, tatami mats, swords and suits of armour. 
This must have been a room to store the daimyo&#39;s keepsakes. 

&quot;Kya, ha, ha, ha, ha!&quot; 


Taki was alert as she heard that disgusting sound, the sound of a 
demon&#39;s laughter. She ran forward through the broken door that led into 
the hallway. The laughter got louder and louder as she stepped out the 
door, the sounds echoing along like a bat&#39;s screeching cry in a dank 
cave. 

Then Taki sniffed something peculiar. &quot;... What? Is that... smoke?&quot; 


Smoke wasn&#39;t good. Smoke meant fire. Taki picked up the pace and ran 
inside one of the rooms next to the one from where she had entered. As 
she stepped inside, and looked around, her eyes thinned out. Her target 
had been caught. 

&quot;Kya, ha, ha, ha, ha!&quot; The demon beast laughed once more as it stared 
at the more-than-ready Taki. It&#39;s pale purple skin with pallid and dry, 
it&#39;s face covered with blood and scars. Its mouth was lined with sharp 
jagged teeth; the fire in its eyes mirrored the flames dancing around 
the room. The beast was clad in the armour of a soldier for the 
Japanese army, another clear indication that the daimyo had to be in 
league with the shogun. 

Taki knew that this creature had grown in strength. If it was able to 
wrap itself in the weapons and armour of mortals, then it must have 
built up a fair amount of energy, most likely from killing some of the 
bushi that had served under the daimyo. After it let out another of 
those horrid laughs, the demon pulled out the sword from the sheath at 
its waist, glaring at Taki with its awful eyes. In return, Taki showed 
nothing but clout and bravery, spreading her legs apart and pulling her 
hand behind her neck. The kunoichi&#39;s nimble fingers inched towards her 
short sword, ones that clutched around it as the demon launched its 
attack. The demon sliced at Taki with its blade, rushing forwards. Taki 
rolled to the side abruptly, withdrawing her mighty partner, Rekkimaru. 

&quot;The time for your judgement is upon you, demon.&quot; Rather than charge in 
head first, Taki ran around the flames that were starting to build in 
the room. The demon&#39;s fiery eyes followed Taki&#39;s movements step for 
step. It was sure that she wasn&#39;t trying to escape, but why run? Soon 
the flames were too high for the demon to spot Taki. It turned around 
fully, dragging its sword along the brown floorboards. It searched the 
fire and the room again, but there was no sign of Taki. Until... 

&quot;Yaaaah!&quot; 


Taki&#39;s fierce scream made even the fire flicker, as she descended 
towards the demon from the upper rafters of the room, with Rekkimaru 
poised to strike. The demon bellowed as Taki sliced through its torso, 
cleaving a fine path of energy as the sword&#39;s Chi proceeded to rend its 
soul. Taki landed near its feet and leapt away, as the beast&#39;s torso 
spat out putrid bile and decaying guts, the colour of a sickly green. 

Taki looked back at the demon. If her black mouthpiece weren&#39;t masking 
it, you would have seen the proud smile that had dropped into a frown. 
Though the demon&#39;s physical body had been sliced open, its demonic 
spirit had suffered only a slight wound. 

Taki blinked. &quot;T-That&#39;s impossible... Rekkimaru should easily be able 
to handle this&#133; it usually kills with one stroke...&quot; 


&quot;Eeeyaaaaaaaah!&quot; The demon released another cruel screech as it charged 
at a startled Taki. It slashed at Taki with the sharp end of its blade. 
Taki brought up Rekkimaru to deflect the blow, a great &#39;clash&#39; sound 
accompanying the roaring of the flames. Taki was still confused by 
Rekkimaru&#39;s failure to defeat this demon, so acted on instinct and 
kicked at the beast&#39;s legs. The demon tripped up and fell over onto 
ground, its armour squashing the embers and charred pieces of wood. 
Taki then leapt backwards, flipping over with her ninja skills. As soon 
as she reached a fair distance, Taki drew her right hand into a fist, 
and then extended the middle and index fingers. Her free hand began a 
series of powerful katas, each one letting loose a fierce flash of 
coloured light. 

Her dark black hair began to rise and the air began to get exceedingly 
thicker, as all of Taki&#39;s strength began to focus in on the downed 
demon. The room then lit up with a bright lavender energy, symbols of 
shuriken appearing along the floorboards and centring in on the demon. 
The evil beast&#39;s eyes went wide with horror as it realized what was 
about to happen. Taki&#39;s Chi had pinned it in place, stopping it from 
moving, while the energy also became more volatile. Taki too knew the 
danger in this, dashing out of the room to escape it. She stormed back 
into the room from which she had gained entry, and jumped up through 
the hole she had previously created. The screams of the demon were loud 
enough to be heard from the outside, but Taki wasted no time thinking 
about it. The Japanese girl quickly jumped off the roof and leapt into 
the cold night air, as the top floor of the castle exploded. With a 
gigantic boom, balls of fire and smoke singed the atmosphere, the 
deafening roar of the explosion causing the flock of birds still hiding 
in the surrounding forest to flee. Though the blast was strong, it 
didn&#39;t knock away Taki&#39;s balance, and she speedily landed on one of the 
lower roofs protruding from the side of the castle. Taki then jumped 
down each roof and dashed between falling shards of debris, finally 
reaching the ground level. 

The young ninja girl gathered gasps of air quickly, her panting 
becoming fiercer. She even coughed a little. Taki had to remove her 
mouthpiece, and then slumped into a sitting position on the stone 
ground of the outer yard. She couldn&#39;t believe that she had to use that 
mystical assault on the demon. And with those thoughts, she came across 
one that was a lot more urgent. 

Why had Rekkimaru not destroyed its target on command? 

Taki pulled her arm behind her head, and withdrew the short sword from 
the scabbard on her back. She pulled it down into her lap and stared at 
it. Now that she had taken this chance to inspect the sword, Taki began 
to realize something. Rekkimaru wasn&#39;t what it used to be. Its former 
sheen was gone, it was slightly chipped, and its edge was getting dull. 
What was worse was that its killing power was being compromised. Was 
Taki&#39;s beloved Rekkimaru... weakening? 

Well, whatever was going on, Taki couldn&#39;t stay here long. Regardless 
of his fear, when the daimyo caught word of the explosion that had 
taken place at Nagato Kyuuden, he&#39;d most likely send some of his 
followers to inspect the situation. And Taki could not be there when 
they arrived. The demon slaying ninja sheathed her blade and began to 
climb up the outer walls surrounding the castle&#39;s yard. But she 
couldn&#39;t help but wonder... 

What was happening to Rekkimaru? 

********** 

Rothion... 

Hmm. I love him greatly. There isn&#39;t a thing I wouldn&#39;t do to keep him 
safe. I&#39;d even take up the sword again. And it was from his seed that I 
gave birth to my two wonderful angels, Pyrrha and Patroklos. And when I 
look my life now, it&#39;s very different to what I had known. The 
sacrifices I made. The people I encountered. 

The woman I fell in love with. 

Taki. 

My eyes dart back over to my sleeping husband, lying next to me on our 
bed. I hate it when I remember my times with Taki with Rothion around. 
I feel as though I betray his love for me... as if I forsake my love 
for him, which is simply wrong. I&#39;d love him to the ends of the 
earth... 

But I&#39;ll never forget what she was to me. 

The beautiful swordswoman of the east... my childhood love, Taki. 

It was six years ago, when I was eighteen, when we first met. I still 
think of myself as a child back then. But I do not mistake what I felt 
for her... not a silly girl&#39;s crush, but a growing woman&#39;s love. And I 
know a part of me still loves her... at times I even miss her. 

I miss the way she would smile after a victory. I miss the way she 
would scold me for making an error in battle. I miss the way her lips 
felt against my own. You never ever forget your first love. But knowing 
Taki, she may have all but forgotten me. Her love for demon killing was 
greater than her love for me; I can see that quite clearly. 

Hmm... I can&#39;t believe that even after these six whole years, that 
still makes me angry. But that was the issue at the heart of it all. 
Had Taki not fully devoted herself to hunting monsters... it might have 
been her lying next to me at present, not Rothion. And I don&#39;t know if 
that makes me sad or happy. Even after all this time, Taki&#39;s influence 
over me is as strong as it ever was. 

I was adolescent at that time. I was... na&iuml;ve and foolish. And it was 
because of this that I was unprepared for what was to become of me. I 
travelled the world to destroy Soul Edge, not to fall in love with this 
strange woman from the east. It was never planned. But then love never 
is. 

With this great feeling of nostalgia... I can remember the very day 
before we met. It was the last day of my journey that I spent alone. 
From then on I would be with the eastern swordswoman... me... an unripe 
girl hopelessly fixated on someone who seemed like she could do 
anything... 

********** 

The Tsuki no Hikari Ryokan, Aki (Chugoku Region), Japan 

&quot;So... what kind of room would you like?&quot; 


Quite a few miles from the Nagato area, was the Aki area. This was home 
to one of Southern Japan&#39;s most talked about and loved Inns, the Tsuki 
no Hikari Ryokan. It was famous because it was one of the few buildings 
that had been untouched throughout the current wars. Somehow it had 
survived the battles in the surrounding areas, even when other 
buildings in the village got caught up in the crossfire. It was like 
many other Japanese-style Inns, roomy and spacious. Below the wooden 
rafters of the upper floor was the lower one, full of wooden tables and 
chairs, surrounded by travellers and survivors of other han, destroyed 
during battle. 

One thing this place was not familiar with was the westerner, least of 
all female westerners who were armed. Which was exactly what the Tsuki 
no Hikari Ryokan had. The stranger was up at the front of the building, 
talking to the manager of the Inn, who was seated behind a counter. She 
was young, that was obvious, around 18 years of age, and was poised 
innocently as she stood in place. People watched her with curiosity as 
well as caution. Distrust of outsiders amongst the peasantry was 
nothing new. But with their stares of anxiety, came stares of lust. 
Though these people were mistrusting, they were not ignorant of beauty. 

The beauteous woman stood out of the crowd, her lithe, well-endowed 
figure teased the patience of any self-respecting man, capturing the 
attention of their hearts and loins. Her long tresses of golden blonde 
hair flowed down onto her shoulders, her sparking blue eyes flicking 
curiously across the building, her na&iuml;ve curiosity showing no bounds. 
Her form of attire was clearly Greek in nature, and her playful yet 
dedicated spirit indicated that she had a purpose for being so far from 
her place of birth. And it was that purpose of hers that was driving 
her ardour. 

This woman&#39;s name was Sophitia Alexandra, the chosen sentinel and 
avatar of the god of the forge, the mighty Hephaestos. 

Sophitia smiled sweetly at the owner of the Inn. &quot;I&#39;d like a normal 
room please... I don&#39;t have much in the way of money... at least not 
the kind of money in circulation in this country... but I will work for 
my stay here, whatever you&#39;d allow.&quot; 


The Inn owner normally would have turned down a request like that, but 
Sophitia&#39;s charming innocence was too much for anyone to withstand. 
&quot;I... will allow this. It&#39;s not often that we have visitors that so 
enjoy traversing a war-torn land.&quot; 


Sophitia&#39;s cheerful smile dropped. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry for your losses. These 
times are so dark and worrying... but the Gods will smile down on us 
eventually, of this I&#39;m sure.&quot; 


&quot;Such childish optimism.&quot; The Inn owner thought. &quot;Thank you. Well, take 
the third room upstairs. You can work off your debt by helping out in 
the kitchens. A bit of work for a day should pay it all off.&quot; 


Sophitia&#39;s bright smile returned to her as she was handed the iron key 
to the room, and she nodded in acceptance of those terms. The young 
girl from Athens walked across the hallway, past the hall downstairs, 
the one full of mistrusting, curious and interested Japanese natives. 
She walked up the creaking staircase, and when she reached the top 
floor she scanned the doors for no.3. In not time at all she found it. 
Sophitia slotted the iron key into the lock, and opened the door to the 
inside. The room wasn&#39;t particularly special. There was a mildly 
comfortable looking bed in the corner, a small chest used for keeping 
clothes, and a simple wooden table. It was not home or anything, but it 
suited Sophitia&#39;s needs. The young woman pulled the pack off of her 
back with a great effort, and laid it to rest on her bed. She opened it 
up and then smiled proudly as she withdrew its contents, some spare 
clothes and items, but what truly pleased her, was the site of her 
gifts from Hephaestos. 

The Omega Sword and Elk Shield. 

Possibly one of the most ultimate swords of the entire world. Created 
by Hephaestos, it was blessed with the vigour of Ares, the wisdom of 
Athene, the beauty of Aphrodite, and the power of Zeus. The sacred 
metal of the sword gleamed with polish and strength. Its design was 
typical of Greek swords, the blade short in length but thick in girth. 
The shield was equally typical, light and rounded. These weapons may 
not have had the effective killing power of the Tanegashima matchlock 
rifle, but Sophitia could have received no better form of protection 
from the Olympian gods. Sophitia pulled out her spare clothing and 
packed it into the chest, then placed her pack at the side of her bed. 
The young girl then slowly crossed her arms over her upper clothing, 
grabbing at it with both hands, and then pulled her chemise free from 
her body. She undressed out of the rest of her clothing, but slowly, 
for she was always more than comfortable with her own nakedness. Within 
a few extra seconds, Sophitia had re-dressed in her nightdress. The 
young woman then removed the Omega sword from her bed, placing it and 
the shield beside her pack, and then slipped under the covers of her 
bed. It wasn&#39;t all that late, only a short few hours after sundown, but 
she wanted an early night. The miracle child from Athens nestled her 
head on her pillow, wrapping her arms around her torso to warm herself 
up. Tomorrow she would continue her journey eastwards. From the way the 
rumours of Soul Edge had been so frequent, it was obvious that whomever 
was wielding it had been moving around. Sophitia mused on that as she 
tried to get to sleep. 

Who was the one that commanded Soul Edge currently? 

The man or woman had to be of unearthly power. There was little chance 
that a simple soul could brandish the Soul Edge and manage to keep a 
grip on themselves. Though Sophitia had not seen it, from the urgency 
of Hephaestos, she could see that her feelings on the situation weren&#39;t 
unlikely. All the same, no matter who carried Soul Edge, it was her 
duty to destroy it. Sophitia began to remember just how she had been 
given that duty. It was merely a few weeks prior to the day. After a 
short morning at the bakery with her brother, Sophitia went down to a 
small lake just outside of Athens. It was such a serene day. Birds 
chipped blissfully, the crystal clear water gleamed with the light of 
sun. Gentle woodland animals scurried around the bank and nuzzled in 
the grass, the brief cries of a hawk flying overhead was part of the 
wonderful backdrop. 

The young blonde of Athens literally drank in the splendour of her 
location. It was like she was experiencing the beauty of nature, 
completely unhindered my human interference. Without hesitation, 
Sophitia shed her clothing along the bank of the lake, leaving behind 
her beautiful naked form, unrestricted by garments. She eagerly dove 
into the water, and after a few moments of admiring the wildlife, she 
started to bathe. 

Then without warning, the water to her left surged upwards. Sophitia 
recoiled in shock, as the crystalline body of Hephaestos rose up from 
the quiet depths. His strong, powerful voice sternly delivered his 
oracle to Sophitia, and he expressly gave her the mission to destroy 
the evil Soul Edge blade before it corrupted anymore of the world. 
Shortly after this revelation, Sophitia journeyed to the sacred 
Eurydice temple, where she was given the Omega Sword and Elk Shield. Of 
course she had to be tested, this was in the form of a spiritual copy 
of Sophitia herself. And though it was a struggle, the real thing 
managed to defeat the copy. Hephaestos wished her the best of luck, and 
then magically transported her to Northern America. From there, she 
began her journey westwards, and eventually reached her current 
location, Japan. 

Though it would be a long, hard task, Sophitia was determined to defeat 
the current wielder of the Soul Edge. Her family would be kept safe in 
the process, and Sophitia would automatically pay her thanks to the 
gods whom had dared to believe in her. 

The young blonde smiled peacefully as she nuzzled her head against the 
straw-filled pillow. Tomorrow would see the continuation of her great 
journey. 

********** 

It&#39;s the middle of the night. 

I wonder what she is doing right now. I can imagine that she is 
betrothed to another. A man that can give her everything I couldn&#39;t. A 
stable life, children, and unconditional love. I suppose I cannot 
expect her to be lonely all her life. Sophitia deserves the world. She 
deserves anything and everything that this simple existence can offer 
her. 

No... I can&#39;t lose my focus... I must be strong... 

I will train myself to the ultimate limit, with Rekkimaru and it&#39;s 
demonic other at my side. 

Not that the shock of Rekkimaru&#39;s weakening didn&#39;t weigh on me at the 
time. 

********** 

Oni Isle, Japan 

&quot;Yaaaah!&quot; 


Taki screamed as her sleekly crafted Rekkimaru cut through the crisp 
night air and lodged into the thin trunk of a bamboo tree. Taki&#39;s 
gasped in surprise when she saw that her blade had only cut through an 
inch of the bamboo. Giving out another scream, she ripped the steel 
from the bamboo tree and stared at it in disbelief. Taki wiped the 
sweat from her brow. It was at least six hours before sunup, and Taki 
had to make her weekly check-up on the shrine of Fury-demons. Of 
course, that was important, but first things first, she had to test out 
Rekkimaru&#39;s strength. And for what it was worth, Rekkimaru seemed to be 
weakening fast. 

The ninja woman was at a small bamboo forest just on the edge of Oni 
Isle. She got back here as fast as she could from Nagato; she knew that 
the trees around this area were tough to blows. Taki had to test out 
Rekkimaru&#39;s strength before she could make any more assumptions. But 
her guesses were correct. Rekkimaru&#39;s deterioration was serious. Not 
only was it waning spiritually, but also physically. 

&quot;I cannot believe this.&quot; Taki said, holding Rekkimaru up limply. 
&quot;Rekkimaru was hand-crafted by my own efforts. I spoke the incantations 
to fill it with masses of spiritual power. So why... why now?&quot; 


Taki shot one last look at Rekkimaru before sheathing it. Something had 
to be done about this. From time to time, she heard stories about a 
blade from the west, a violently powerful weapon that was said to carry 
the strengths of armies. It was around the time of these rumours that 
Taki began noticing Rekkimaru&#39;s strange behaviour. If these situations 
were linked in any way... there was no way Taki could let it go. 

After picking up the stray bits of armour, shed during the test of 
Rekkimaru&#39;s power, Taki strode off into the darkness of the bamboo 
forest. If there was a connection between Rekkimaru&#39;s new limitations 
and the Soul Edge, or if there was something Soul Edge could do to ease 
it, Taki would hunt the blade down to the ends of the earth. 

Starting now.

Kaiser&#39;s Afterthoughts 

* My first Soul Blade/Edge/Calibur fic. There are a few things of 
notice though, I feel as though I should say as much. One, I base my 
info on Edge Master mode of the original Soul Blade. If that conflicts 
with more recent information about the series, then I&#39;ll change it in 
due time. Two, my spelling of certain god&#39;s names differ from those 
used in SC. For example &#39;Hephaestos&#39; instead of &#39;Hephaestus&#39; or 
&#39;Athene&#39; instead of &#39;Athena&#39;. This is simply because my resources on 
Greek mythology spell these names as such. 

* Any comments would be appreciated; I&#39;m always open to feedback. </pre>
