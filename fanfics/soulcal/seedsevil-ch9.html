<h1>The Seeds of Evil: Phoenix Rising (part 9 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../soulcal/seedsevil-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>	A tournament was being held in the Ming Empire. The
winner was allowed a private audience with the Emperor himself...
and anything they asked for, they would be given. Many believed
that by winning this challenge, great riches would be theirs.
Others sought a new weapon for their own personal use, and
China was known for the beauty, strength, and durability of
her weapons. Yet many went to boast their strength so that
they may join the army and serve their country.

	However, a certain few wanted the most precious treasure
of all... information. For them, an audience with the emperor was
vital to a quest or any other undertaking. Therefore, they would 
fight with their entire being, body and soul, to overcome the other 
challengers. Thus, these souls were the ones to beware of in the 
battle, as the many warriors that have gathered will soon discover...

- Chapter 9: Battle One... FIGHT!
____________________________________________________________________

	Of course, not all were seasoned veterans in combat.
Some were only children, and not much older than Talim.
They were easy prey... yet they were still competent fighters
for thier age. They were therfore placed into another class,
and would be fighting before the more experienced warriors.
However, Talim was placed in the same class as the older
fighters, which upset the young challengers. &quot;I guess it&#39;s
just the luck of the draw, fellas,&quot; sha apologized. &quot;Hey,
don&#39;t worry, though. I&#39;ll win for all of us!&quot; They seemed to
be satisfied with this, and wished her good fortune.

	Mina, who stood by and watched this, did nothing but
smile. &#39;She gets along so well with them. Maybe it&#39;s because
of her pure heart. She could be the one...&#39; Her weapon replied
with &#39;Indeed... but let&#39;s not make any judgements yet.&#39; &#39;Right.&#39;
And so, she continued her excersizes. But she noticed that 
the young Talim was watching...
____________________________________________________________________

	She had never seen a weapon of that size before;
about seven feet long. And she guessed that it had a 
considerable weight to it as well. But despite this, the 
woman in red had great control over it, as if it were
part of her body. &#39;Amazing... such speed and control
at that weight... it&#39;s like she&#39;s fighting with the wind 
as her sword.&#39; 

	&quot;Hello, there!&quot; The woman was approaching her...
&#39;The winds say that she means no harm... but they also
say that her path is full of suffering.&#39; &quot;Take care.&quot;
The woman was confused at this. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; &quot;I said,
&#39;Take care.&#39; You have many dangers ahead of you... I
worry about your future. So take care.&quot; The woman was
in even greater confusion at this, but she pretended
not to care. &quot;So, anyway... what&#39;s your name?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m Talim, a priestess of the wind. I&#39;m looking
for the source of an evil wind that is spreading across 
the land, and once I find it, I will set it right.&quot; She
was wize to hide her intentions from this stranger, for
the woman would not believe her. &quot;And what is your name?&quot;
&quot;Seung Mina. I&#39;m from Korea, a country east of this one.
You&#39;re from India, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Talim was surprised at this
woman&#39;s accuracy. 

	&quot;Yes, I am... how did you know?&quot; &quot;I&#39;ve been there
before, so I know how to recognize people from that country.&quot;
&#39;Of course... that would give it away, wouldn&#39;t it?&#39; The
woman named Mina noticed Talim&#39;s downcast look, and tried to
explain herself. &quot;Hey, those are the nicest people I&#39;ve
ever met! I don&#39;t have anything against you, Talim, I was
just wondering!&quot; &#39;So... you are not against me... I guess
you&#39;re all right.&#39; 
____________________________________________________________________

	A woman of age 20 approached the gardens. Hooded and
cloaked, she looked like a commoner who was trying to watch 
the fights... which was exactly how she wanted to look. This
woman had studied the matchup draws very carefully, and
had picked a child&#39;s name... one who she thought would not 
win. &quot;Excuse me...&quot; The guard looked at her with a stern 
expression. &quot;Yeah, lady? What, did you come to see the fight?&quot;
She hid a smirk as she said &quot;Yes... my son is competing.&quot;

	After hearing his name, the guard checked the
draws... &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s in here. You still hafta pay, though.&quot;
And, to the guard&#39;s surprise, she did. &quot;Hmm... well, it&#39;s 
enough. Go on.&quot; Once she was inside, she quickly retreated to 
the shadows and planned her next move. &#39;So far, so good.
But it&#39;s up to him, now. If he wins, I&#39;m in big trouble...&#39;
This woman did not have a son. In fact, she wasn&#39;t even allowed 
inside the gardens. Her name was Chai Xianghua, and her
knowledge of deception had come in handy again, though
she felt bad about the boy. 

	&#39;I don&#39;t wish him to win... but I hope he gets far!&#39;
Thus, she headed off to find a seat. But she was still wary
of her surroundings. &#39;I think I fooled them easily enough.
But still, I have to be careful. They won&#39;t be so easily fooled 
next time...&#39;
____________________________________________________________________

	The Amatuer Class would be finished soon, so Mina 
prepared herself for combat. &#39;I didn&#39;t think that I&#39;d be 
fighting so early! But then again, the sooner, the better!&#39;
Her persona spoke up. &#39;Remember, this is a test of your own
strength. You cannot use my strength in competition. It 
would give you too great of an advantage.&#39; Mina frowned at
that. &#39;Whose side are you on, anyway?&#39; &#39;I only wish for
you to keep yourself pure, Mina. Promise me that you
will keep me hidden until the proper time.&#39;

	Mina sighed at this, but agreed. &#39;All right. 
I promise.&#39; She headed to the final match, when suddenly,
she heard a faint whine from the blade... &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;
&#39;It is here... somewhere.&#39; Mina was on alert. &#39;What? 
What&#39;s here?&#39; &#39;Find out for yourself. You know how, Don&#39;t 
you?&#39; &#39;Yeah. Hang on, I&#39;m doing it now...&#39; Mina cleared
all things from her mind and closed her eyes. Her other
senses came into play... but they saw nothing.

	&#39;Do not look only to your senses. Look deeper...&#39;
She increased her concentration... and began to sense
something strange. Something that didn&#39;t belong. She
went further, and it became clearer and clearer, until...
&#39;There! In that bag... it&#39;s a piece of Soul Edge! Talim
was carrying around a fragment of that sword!&#39; &#39;I know
what you&#39;re thinking. She is still pure, and has not
been tainted by the Blade. But it calls to one of
its kindred.... somewhere in this country.&#39;

	&#39;We&#39;ve gotta stop it!&#39; The weapon had doubts 
about their chances, however. &#39;It won&#39;t be easy. That
girl believes that the problem will be solved by bringing
the pieces back together again. You must convince her to
end this quest of hers... or we are all doomed.&#39; She
didn&#39;t like the way he said &quot;convince her&quot;. &#39;I won&#39;t kill 
her. She&#39;s got nothing to do with this! She&#39;s just
fifteen... she doesn&#39;t know any better! And I bet she&#39;s
never left her village before now, either!&#39;

	&#39;Then, what do you suggest?&#39; Mina stopped short of
her ranting. She had to think of something, or else killing 
her was the only option... &#39;Well then, I have advice, if 
you&#39;ll listen.&#39; Mina didn&#39;t have time for his advice, but she 
knew the concequences of not listening to advice. &#39;I&#39;m 
listening...&#39; &#39;When one fails, many are needed. Should they
fail, all is lost.&#39; Another riddle. But at least it was a 
clue. &#39;All right, I&#39;ll play along.&#39;
____________________________________________________________________

	As Talim prepared herself to fight, she reflected 
upon the reason that she traveled here. &#39;One of the fragments
of metal is here... I must warn the ruler of this country
to beware of it. As far as I can see, this is the only
way to speak to him.&#39; She put her game face on, and steeled
herself for what was approaching... &#39;No one will stand in my 
way! I have to win... or the evil will continue to spread!&#39;

	But she also knew that the Korean woman in red would
be one of the competitors. &#39;Her soul is strong, no doubt.
Not even the winds can protect me from her... her will
is too strong. She might be of some help to me later on...
but for now, I have to overcome her. She seeks the pieces
of metal as well... but the winds tell me that she seeks
something else. Who, or what, is she looking for?&#39; Talim
centered her focus on the upcoming battle again. &#39;I&#39;ll ask
her later. For now, I must focus...&#39;
____________________________________________________________________

	Xian had much to speak about to the emperor. But
doing so would expose her. &#39;I wish that I could move freely;
then I could do this the easy way, through this tournament.&#39;
Her weapon gave off a soft whine, as if it were afraid of 
something. &#39;Yes, it&#39;s here. No doubt about that. I&#39;m sure
that Mina knows that too... now if only I could find her.&#39;
The burden of not telling Mina about her situation was
almost too much. If only she&#39;d told her earlier... but it
didn&#39;t come then.

	&#39;Maybe I was too happy to see her to tell her...
but that&#39;s no excuse. I could&#39;ve told her on the way here...
so why didn&#39;t I?&#39; She had no clue... but she didn&#39;t like this 
feeling within her. She wondered how Mina felt right now...
____________________________________________________________________
	
	&quot;Damn those pirates. They have no honor... they hire
me to fight their battles for them. Spineless dogs. 
But still...&quot; The mercenary smiled as he looked at the 
opportunity before him. &quot;Still, these are strong opponents.
Somehow, I can feel it. This could be interesting, and worth
my time...&quot; He had already signed up for the fight, and
had free time until his matches. People in the streets stared 
at him in awe... for some, this was their first look at
the man known as the Demon...

	He still looked for the weapon that was said to conquer 
firearms... but he had since been discouraged from that
quest. He carried with him a fragment of the blade that was
said to be unbreakable. Little did he know that his coming 
here was the will of that little shard, for there were two
other pieces like it in this country... and they called for 
each other as if they longed to be whole once again.

	And on top of this, the winds of battle were stirring...
for he too was at that same castle on the Ming border that
Xianghua was assigned to, and before it fell... he heard talk
of another piece of the sword from the servants... and how it
had poisoned their master&#39;s mind. He was obsessed over it; 
could not be separated from it. &quot;Why would the lord of
this castle bother with a little piece of metal? Unless it&#39;s...&quot;
He didn&#39;t want to say it, because it would make it final,
absolute, and unchangeable.

	But, with two shards in his possesion, he was faced 
with the truth... it wasn&#39;t the strongest weapon in the world.
there had to be another, somewhere. So he came to these gardens
to compete for a new one, for he was disillusioned with Soul Edge.
&quot;No more foolish legends and myths! I&#39;ll have to follow a
new lead... one that&#39;s actually true!&quot; And so, he had freed
himself from the influence of the Blade. But that left only
one option... he would have to win by his own strength. And
if that wasn&#39;t enough... all hope was gone.
