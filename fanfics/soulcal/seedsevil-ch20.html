<a href="../soulcal/seedsevil-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>Mina had just about ingited.

The Flames of Passion burned the very air around her, the
heavy, sultry heat in the room enough to suffocate. She
cried out in sheer extacy as her body was bathed in
sensations, and ascended as easily as she breathed.

Talim and Xianghua grinned widely as their toy lay on the
bed, breathing heavily. They were soon about to find out
just how much this new body of Mina&#39;s could take... no
one realized that throughout the entire night, something
had changed.

Talim no longer burned when she touched her friend.

Chapter 20- A New Soul Arrives
___________________________________________________________

The next morning, they were in a comfortable haze, lying
in Mina&#39;s bed and nestled comfortably against one another.
Small sighs of pleasure and contentment came from Talim
at times, and Xianghua had a smile on her face while she
slept.

Mina was the first one to stir. The morning sun had given
her a boost of energy as she absorbed the heat that it
provided for her. This was no surprise, seeing as she
could walk through fire itself and be unharmed.

Effectively, she was a pyrokinetic, thanks to the Scarlet
Thunder. Over time, she had learned its signifigance as
a Seung family heirloom- the weapon responded to the
emotions and the will of the user.

The stronger the emotions, the heavier and sharper the
blade, not to mention the heat that radiated from the steel.
In addition, the weapon gave in return- power beyond one&#39;s
imagination. It was a rare trait within many to be able
to effectively control the fires that were awakened within
them without killing themselves.

But Mina&#39;s sheer determination had come through in the end,
and now she was in command. She would have to remember not
to get so angry these days- powerful emotions were very
volatile if they were not controlled.

However, that was the last thing on her mind right now,
as she looked over at her two lovers, smiling warmly. She
wanted to get up and head outside, but they were pretty
much lached onto her. She didn&#39;t have it within her to
wake them up.

But she had to. Her weapon began to pulse with its red
light, the dull thud of the heartbeat sounding off through
the room. She didn&#39;t know why it was suddenly reacting now,
but the Krita-Yuga was being set off as well, shining with
a pale blue light and giving off a faint hum.

(Someone&#39;s here. These weapons are reacting... either to
the Soul Edge, or something else. I don&#39;t know what it is,
but I sure will find out.)

By now, Xianghua had awakened, hearing the telltale whine
of her weapon. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; she asked sleepily.

Mina said nothing- only got up from in between them and put
on a white tunic from her travel bag, then put on a silken
green dress with a golden dragon on the front. &quot;Xian, come
and help me out with the back.&quot;

Xianghua, a bit puzzled, nodded and rose to help her. Talim,
surprisignly was still asleep through all this, though it
wasn&#39;t much of a shock, due to the events of the prior
evening.

As She tightened the ties in the back so the silken garb fit
comfortably around her body, she asked her questions,
directing her thoughts toward her instead of speaking.

(What&#39;s up? Why are our weapons going off like crazy?)

Mina frowned in distaste. She honestly didn&#39;t know, and only
had two guesses as to why.

(It&#39;s either Soul Edge, which couldn&#39;t be all the way up here,
or another Divine Treasure that was right under our noses. We
just didn&#39;t have the time to look for it.)

Xianghua nodded. She knew exactly who it could be, and knew
of one such treasure that was formerly a possesion of the Ling
Sheng Su temple.

(It has to be Kilik and the Kali-Yuga. The reason why the
weapons hadn&#39;t gone off yet were due to the fact that he rarely
comes down from his training in the mountains. He usually lives
there most of the time.)

Xianghua had finished up, and Mina was reaching into the bag
again, looking for the yellow sash that she usually tied around
her waist with this outfit. She found it, and wrapped it around
her stomach, asking Xianghua to tie it off.

(Well then, it looks like he&#39;s finally come down... he
should be knocking any moment now.)

Bingo. Three knocks on the door. He was here. Fortunately,
Xian was finished tying her sash in the back, and Mina ran
her hands through her hair, getting it as straight as
possible. Then she opened the door, just as Kilik&#39;s hand came
up to knock.

&quot;Well, if it isn&#39;t Kilik. I&#39;ve been expecting you.&quot;
___________________________________________________________

Edge Master had been up on the mountain top, near the shaolin
temple. He was meditating as per usual, emptying his mind.
While he had done so, one thing reoccured over time- That
they were leaving, and to do battle with the evil that
had spread across the world.

He decided to give them a little help, besides the usual advice.
Usually, he would not let Kilik out of the mountains, due to
the fact that he was still training him. Sure, he had the
energy under control, but he was planning to do something
that was pretty much improbable- not impossible, it just
had a slim chance of working.

But if he was determined enough to leave, then he would leave.
But he would not be going alone, like last time. Someone had
to do something, just in case this failed. Sure, the Kali-Yuga
could absorb anything... but if there were too much negative
energy, the seal on the weapon could be broken, and it would
simply be another Soul Edge.

But there was no way that he could dissuade him from leaving.
So he had asked Mina, Xianghua, and Talim to meet him on
the summit, to make a request.

Thus, Kilik had come to tell them about it.

&quot;Master wants to see the three of you, as soon as you&#39;re ready.&quot;

Mina nodded. &quot;Thanks, we&#39;ll be right out.&quot; She then noticed the
seven foot rod, and looked at it a bit skeptically. She had
been beaten by that infernal weapon- she knew it once she
felt the energy from her strikes being channeled into his
weapon.

(He can take a beating with that weapon in hand. Sure, he can
die, but it&#39;ll take a lot more than mere strength. He could
help us, but...)

&quot;Is something wrong, Mina?&quot;

She shook her head at this and smiled sweetly. &quot;No, nothing.
We&#39;ll be right out.&quot;

Kilik nodded, and Mina closed the door as he left, thinking
about her options. He would probably be coming with them,
seeing as it was a Divine Treasure he was carrying. But
was he really able to actually wield that weapon properly?

She had bested him three times, knocking him to the floor
and pinning him effectively. What would he be able to do
against an opponent who would kill him outright?

Then, there was Talim to think about. She could feel the evil
radiating from him, flowing through the winds and poisoning
them. Certainly, she was baffled as to how he could keep from
going insane, with all those negative forces within him.

But she would much rather kill him then let him come along...
there would be dissent if they let him go. She would have to
think of something. For now, she woke Talim up, playfully
nipping her earlobe and grinning as she woke up with a start.

&quot;Good morning, my cute little priestess. We&#39;re leaving today.&quot;
___________________________________________________________

The three of them were at the temple later that morning,
wanting to hear what he had to say. Mina looked oh-so-bored;
she wanted to be on the way. The other two listened intently,
paying attention to every word.

&quot;You&#39;re leaving, are you not?&quot;

Mina nodded, still having that passive expression on her face.
&quot;Yeah. We&#39;ve got a lot of work to do, and a lot of ground to
cover if we want to find all those shards before anyone else
does.&quot;

His eyes still closed, the aged master swordsman nodded. &quot;It
would&#39;ve come to this, sooner or later. The path that you are
about to travel will most likely be the last one you ever walk.
Are you willing to accept this?&quot;

They all nodded, determined looks on their faces. The faster they
finished this, the sooner they could live their lives together.
That&#39;s what was on their minds and in their imaginations, at
least.

&quot;Fine. But you need a bit more force than you have now. So I
have a proposition to make... allow Kilik to come with you.&quot;

Talim&#39;s eyes widened signifigantly at this. Mina and Xianghua
could feel her fear at this request- they could understand it
as well. Sure, he had managed to calm the raging torrent of evil
within him, but it was still there, and could rise at any time,
seeing as they were going to be in contact with Soul Edge for
quite a while.

It was a problem that Mina had been thinking of for the
longest time, and she hadn&#39;t come up with an answer yet. As
she considered the options, only one stood out in her mind,
though it was probably the worst of the choices.

&quot;Um.. one of us has a problem with that. Talim feels that
he could be a risk to our journey, and needs to be reassured.&quot;

Edge Master quirked an eyebrow. &quot;And just how do you plan on
reassuring her, when you have not done so already?&quot;

The next few words had no easy or subtle way to be said, so
she did what she always did- went with her first instinct.

&quot;I plan on having her face that fear. It&#39;s the only way that
she&#39;ll be able to accept it.&quot;

Talim and Xianghua looked at her in shock. Effectively, she
was planning on having the two of them face each other in
combat- not to kill each other, just to have her get past
her doubts about him. It was a good idea, but there were
definite risks.

(Mina...) Talim&#39;s mind spoke to her, very much afraid of
what she was planning. (What if it doesn&#39;t turn out right?
What if I&#39;m poisoned by the evil, just like everyone else?
I&#39;m not sure what will happen...)

Mina looked at her with the same intense stare that she used
to get someone to pay close attention. (He&#39;s not coming, then.
The next time he gets in our path, we&#39;ll take care of him then.
For now, just trust me... okay?)

Talim nodded slowly to her, still unsure. Mina smiled warmly
at her, and took one of the young woman&#39;s hands into her own,
squeezing reassuringly. (Everything will turn out right in the
end. Consider this... a test of faith.)

Talim&#39;s face calmed down from the fearful, anxious expression,
the calm, stoic determination in her eyes coming back to the
surface. (All right. I&#39;ll fight him. Maybe the winds will tell
me something about him...)

Mina smiled again. (That&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping for. Now, get ready.)

&quot;You&#39;ve made your choice, then?&quot;

&quot;We have. Please send for Kilik, if you would. We&#39;re going to
have him prove his worth if he wants to tag along.&quot;
___________________________________________________________

Kilik stood in front of Talim, holding his rod in a neutral
stance, with one end on the ground. &quot;You&#39;re sure you want
to do this? I don&#39;t want you to do anything that you don&#39;t
feel is right...&quot;

Talim shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m not sure. But if I don&#39;t face this
now, I won&#39;t be able to face it at all. Besides,&quot; she said as
she got into her ready stance, &quot;The winds will protect me.&quot;

Kilik nodded and got into his ready stance. &quot;Fine. If this
is how it has to be, then I accept it. Come on!&quot; Seeing as
there was no real way out of the fight, he decided to take
the initiative and struck first, wheeling his rod before
thrusting forward with one hand, straight at Talim&#39;s gut.

She quickly spun to the right, and started advancing toward
him slowly. He pulled his weapon back and watched closely for
anything suspicious. Suddenly, she came rushing forward,
charging at him with a surprising speed. It would be a
simple enough move to just knock her senseless as she attacked,
so he did so, slamming the opposite end of the rod down on her
head quite hard, forcing her to slam into the ground face first.

However, there was something else. While the rod was planted
firmly on the back of her head, he swung around it twice,
gaining enough momentum to have him standing straight up in the
air before pulling the rod out from under him and coming down
on her with tremendous force.

As he landed and took a few steps back, still in stance, he
looked at her with a sad gaze in his eyes. He didn&#39;t want this
to happen, but it had come to this anyway, and if this was
the way that things would go, then he wouldn&#39;t hold back.

(She has a good heart,) he thought to himself. (I can&#39;t let
her continue any further, lest her innocense be stolen from
her. Her journey has to end here.)

Meanwhile, Talim was slowly getting back up, the world
spinning around her. She shut her eyes tightly, wating for
everything to stop moving. When she opened them again after
a few seconds, everything was somewhat back to normal.

(I can&#39;t just rush in like that again... But that weapon
is just like Mina&#39;s. I can&#39;t possibly get close enough, and
even if I did, he would simply stop me before I even made
a move.)

She got into stance again, and started moving forward, one
shuffle step at a time, slowly and carefully advancing. She
would need to get inside of his range in order to properly
fight him... but in order to do that, she would have to find
a way to bait him to the attack.

He acted on reaction and instinct, and she had to use that
to her advantage.

As she got into range, Kilik thrust towards her again, the
rod heading straight towards her face. She stepped her right
foot forward and to the left, turning on the ball of her foot
and ducking low. The attack passed harmlessly through the air,
but her back was turned...

&quot;Kinda useless, don&#39;t you think?&quot; He swung his rod down on
her head, intent on teaching her a strict lesson about turning
her back on the opponent. Imagine his surprise when she flicked
her left blade upwards as she turned around, knocking his rod
upwards, countering his forward movement and making him stumble
backwards a bit before stepping in with her right foot, slamming
into his gut with the back of her right blade.

The air was knocked out of him as he slumped to the ground, and
she struck again, bringing both of her blades down on him hard,
tearing into his back and sending him to the ground. He didn&#39;t
feel the strike, or his flesh tearing... it certainly was
because of the Kali-Yuga that he could take all that pain.

But a cut is a cut, and he felt the wind being knocked out
of him, that was for sure. As he caught his breath, she brought
her arms inward in a wide circle, feeling the air around her
being drawn toward her. As she pulled back, she gave the winds
that had been drawn within her a single command- to give her
news about the man before her whom she had effectively
knocked the air out of.

Then she turned on her right heel and crouched low before
stepping forward with her left leg, and as soon as her foot
was on the ground, Talim struck, her right blade cutting
through the air in a vertical arc and sending a blast of
the winds that she had harnessed toward his direction.

The wind shot forward, lifting him into the air and sending
him flying. As she stretched out her arms again, willing the
blast of cold air to head back to her, Talim could feel
the negative energies that were caught in the wind. She braced
herself, wondering what kind of actions could bring about such
a power.

What she would discover... would not be pretty.
___________________________________________________________

A Kilik that was four years younger and without any scar
or blemish on him was seen sitting casually on the stone
wall behind the massive main hall on a clear, starlit night.

He looked up at the stars, wondering how they could be so
carefree as they looked down on the burdens of the world
below... His burdens included.

He had just been elected as the successor of the Kali-Yuga.
It was the goal of all the students that trained in the
temple; just not his. All he wanted to do was guide and
instruct- he wanted no symbol of his skill or a higher
rank. He simply wanted the children whom he taught to be
happy.

His eyes closed and he sighed resolutely.

(Well, it would&#39;ve come to that, sooner or later. After
all, my teachers did say that I had the most potential
they had ever seen, though I simply do my best. It&#39;s
all I can do. But... the Kali-Yuga? I don&#39;t think
I can bear the weight of it...)

Suddenly, a new presence flickered in his mind. He didn&#39;t
feel the need to look behind him- he simply asked calmly
and politely.

&quot;Did you want to speak with me?&quot;

The woman behind him shook her head, smiling softly. &quot;Just
wanted a quiet place to sit and think. But if you want to
talk, then I have the time. Besides, tomorrow is the big
day, isn&#39;t it? Well, I&#39;ll talk now, seeing as I can&#39;t talk
later.&quot;

Kilik noddded, understandably. She talked when she was
nervous. He patted a spot next to him and she walked over,
leaping up to stand on the very spot he indicated before
sitting on the wall.

Talim- whom none could see, due to the fact that this was the
past- looked on, slightly confused. The woman that had
walked forward was familiar- strikingly so. In fact, she slowly
drew an invisible line, just at the middle of her neck,
imagining that she was cutting the woman&#39;s hair... and she
gasped in shock as the face in her mind matched perfectly
with the face she saw as the female monk walked by.

(Xianghua!? But your hair is a lot shorter than that!
What does this mean?)

As they talked on about the ceremony that would take place
the next day, as well as some things that didn&#39;t make much
sense, they smiled warmly. This place was special for both
of them.

However, conversation brought forth questions. And Kilik
had one on his mind ever since he had heard some...
interesting news. He decided to ask her. &quot;I heard that
you&#39;ve been asked to be the successor for the Krita-Yuga...
and that you rejected the request. Any good reason why?
After all, you&#39;re a prodigy of the sword...&quot;

Her head bowed, and her face was now filled with a shame
that had no measure. &quot;There is no Krita-Yuga. At least,
not anymore.&quot; Kilik quirked an eyebrow. Had he heard
right? And what was that face for?

&quot;Why do you say this? Why is the sword no more?&quot;

She looked up at him, tears fresh in her eyes. &quot;It&#39;s been
stolen. And for ten years, it&#39;s never been found.. ever.&quot;

His eyes widened slightly. How the hell could someone have
gotten into one of the most prestigious martial arts schools
in China, gotten past many who would rather die than see one
of the three treasured icons fall into the hands of some
stranger, and left without a trace?

&quot;You can&#39;t be serious. It&#39;s not possible, unless it was done
from the inside.. I don&#39;t know of anyone who would remotely
think of doing such a thing.&quot;

She bowed her head again. &quot;I do... Kong Xiuqiang, my father.&quot;

Kilik&#39;s eyes widened once again from this new shock. &quot;Kong?
But he was devoted to the temple- one of our best! How could
he-&quot; She shrugged. She knew nothing of his reasons, nor why
he would do such a thing. She was too young to understand
why, or how he had done it when she simply overheard it
in a conversation.

But she did understand some other words over time. &quot;Cut
your own path in life, and do not be bound by your parents&#39;
actions.&quot;

However.. &quot;I just can&#39;t. If people knew the truth, they
wouldn&#39;t accept me... That, and the fact that I don&#39;t
want to be the successor. It&#39;s just a silly sword, anyway-
not some position of rank or standing, but in the end,
just a sword.&quot;

Kilik nodded, falling into silence. She did the same,
somehow better for telling someone who she felt so
comfortable with about her situation. As the wind turned
from being pleasantly cool to downright cold, they both
said their goodbyes.

&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do fine as the successor for the
Dvapara-Yuga, Xianglian,&quot; he said with a smile. She nodded,
and smiled back at him.

(Xianglian... they sound so similar,) Talim thought. (She
must be her sister, then. No wonder she is so good with a
sword- it runs in the family.)

Talim smiled warmly. Just another thing to admire from her.

However, they wouldn&#39;t be going to bed that night...

They could both sense the evil within the skies- the lights
of radiant colors were not fooling them in any way. &quot;What?
Where did this come from?&quot;

Kilik&#39;s eyes narrowed warily. &quot;The treasures. They might be
tainted! We have to go Xian, now!&quot; She nodded and they both
ran towards the nearby shrine, where the priests were already
one step ahead of them. Xianglian threw the mirrored sash
around her shoulder, fitting it loosely across her chest.

As Kilik expertly twirled the Kali-Yuga around one of his
shoulders, he grimaced, his face set in a determined
expression. They had to stop this before it went any further.

As if they were thinking the same thing, they both shouted
out at the same time, charging towards the main temple.

&quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot;

Suddenly, the screams and cries of madness and death came
from the temple proper... Talim closed her ears, not wanting
to hear it. But it only made the shouts louder, more
pronounced.

As if she could rememeber this happening...

Before she passed out on the ground, a brief scene flashed
through her head- the one when she was still a child... the
one where she heard the screams.. felt the madness... could
almost see the death. It was then that she realized, without
hesitation, what she had experienced.

(This is what happened? Oh, Goddess...)
___________________________________________________________

She woke up much later that afternoon with a start. The
memories flooded back to her- save for the fact that they
were now paired with exactly what had happened all those
years ago.

Once again.. she shed tears. Just like before. And just like
before, a pair of arms wrapped around her. No wait.. it was
different this time. She opened her blurry eyes and found
that a mess of deep brown, almost black hair was on her left
side, and hair of a lighter, almost reddish brown was on her
right.

Two comforting presences filled her mind, and she allowed
herself to cry into Xianghua&#39;s shoulder, seeing as it was
the closest one she could find. She managed to speak in
between sobs...

&quot;It was... it was horrible...&quot;

Mina spoke up, concerned. &quot;What was? Did you see something?&quot;

Kilik and Edge Master were listening in as well, wondering
if it would explain why the fight had gone on in the first
place. What they heard would intrigue one, and shock the
other.

&quot;I saw, all right. I saw everything... a temple. One with
a lot of strong fighters... they killed each other, and
Kilik was in the middle, along with this woman who looked
just like Xianghua, but had long hair...&quot;

Xianghua&#39;s eyes widened a bit. She was never at the Ling
Sheng Su all those years ago, when it was destroyed. In
fact, logic dictated that she was still growing up during
that time. Mina and Kilik had told her all about the
massacre at the Ling Sheng Su, and she thought that it
was a horrible incident.

But she had never thought that someone who looked exactly
like her had been killed in the process. And seeing as
she didn&#39;t have a clue as to how she could be in two
places at once...

She concluded that she had a sister... one that she was
never told about. But if that were the case, then why?
What had happened that was so bad that her mother would
keep this from her?

Even the name that Kilik spoke sounded remotely like her
own...

&quot;Xianglian...&quot;

Talim&#39;s eyes opened, and she looked at Kilik with a
sorrowful gaze. &quot;Yes, that was her name. She was very...
important to you, wasn&#39;t she? Like a sister to you?&quot;

He nodded. &quot;Yes... we were both there when it all happened
that night. It was just before-&quot;

She shook her head. &quot;Don&#39;t. I know everything.&quot; She stood
finally, looking at Xianghua and Mina gratefully before
turning toward Kilik. &quot;You can come with us- this has
to end, once and for all.&quot;

Mina smiled. She supposed that the fight would have to
be on hold for quite a while...
___________________________________________________________

That night, she had nightmares.

Visions of things happening- things that she couldn&#39;t
explain- nor did she want to. Mina, looking sadly at her,
Xianghua dying in place of Xianglian, the temple burning,
then her villaige burning as well...

She had visions, too. A place far away, further east of them.
The buildings had intricate designs, and castles were the
highest she had ever seen. Cherry blossoms seemed to float
through the air consistantly, but there was something else.
Something that tainted the beauty.

The sounds of battle.

Blood rained from the air as people killed each other, for
survival, for defense, for their homes... for their glory.

For the Blade. For the Soul Edge.

Just as she realized this, she woke up in a cold sweat.

Mina and Xianghua could feel her stir, and opened their eyes
slowly, the comfortable darkness setting in and keeping their
eyes relaxed. The moonlight shone through the windows,
casting a ghostly haze on the room.

&quot;Talim?&quot; Mina asked, sleepily. &quot;Everything okay?&quot;

She nodded. &quot;Just a dream. A strange one, too... I was in a
place that I had never heard of or seen before. Flowers
were everywhere, and the buildings were amazing. Very
beautiful... but there was fighting as well. Everyone wanted
to have the power to defeat the other, save for a few...&quot;

Mina had a picture in her head now. The intricacy of the
buildings and the flowers being everywhere could only mean
two distinct things... she needed to be sure.

&quot;Um... what weapons did they have? Just need to confirm..&quot;

Talim quirked an eyebrow, wondering why she would ask such a
question. But she decided to humor her. &quot;Long, curved swords-
some of them looked a little like yours; a blade on the end of
a rod.&quot;

Mina nodded. The single edged curved swords had only three
places of high craftsmanship. She was almost certain however,
that no other nation used the polearms that Talim mentioned.
Even she had used one, a long time ago..

&quot;Naginata. You saw Japan in a dream...&quot;

The two of them looked over at her, a bit surprised. &quot;You
know of this place?&quot; Talim asked in wonder. Mina nodded.
&quot;Been there twice. And there&#39;s a battle going on over there,
too...&quot;

Xianghua suddenly got the picture. &quot;Korea and Japan are
fighting. In that kind of conflict, you could find almost
anything and anyone...&quot;

The three of them smiled at each other. How simple it was, to
find the other two sacred treasures! And seeing as Mina knew
exactly what they looked like, it would be a snap for them to
find them.

&quot;That settles it. We have a destination.&quot;
___________________________________________________________

The next morning, they were all ready for the trip. Mina
explained the situation to Kilik, and he only nodded. Of course,
there would be other treasures. He only knew of just those three.
But in any case, he said that he would help in any way he could.

As they headed for the mountain path that led back to the main
road, Edge Master followed, giving them a final warning.

&quot;Do not get distracted. There are many things that will divert
you all from the path that you are taking- straying is not an
option, seeing as time is short. Keep moving forward, no matter
what the cost, and you may change the fate of this world forever.&quot;

They all nodded, and waved goodbye to him as they set off, back
down into the valley.

The three heroines held each other closely as they walked,
wondering what would come next, and smiling at the reactions
that most people would have as they walked down the street like
this. They would make it a point to do so, sooner or later.

As Mina looked up at the clear blue sky, she thought about
Yunsung and how he recklessly ran out of the school without
thinking about putting the sword back, as well as going out
without knowing what to expect.

(I guess I&#39;ll have to deal with him, sooner or later... but
I&#39;m not going to worry unless I find him. For now, I just
want to stay like this forever.)

Perhaps, given the right circumstances, it could be that way...

Yeah, you heard me. This is the finale, my friends. I&#39;m
taking a break after this one... you may as well just sit
there and chill for a bit while I replenish my energies.

On that note, the poll is closed now. Thanks for keeping
it ticking! See you guys next time. For now, a bit of
a teaser...
___________________________________________________________

As the man stared in the reflection of the blade that
strained against his, he saw.. himself. Only it was without
the mask, without the armor or the trappings or the poisons.

He was a man with brown eyes and hair, and seemed to be
somewhat in pain. His mind was being twisted and his true
self was growing weaker with every shard he collected.

(What... what is happening to me? Is this... is this my
fate if I keep going like this?)

Suddenly, his blade was forced away, the young man finally
overcoming the sheer weight of the weapon. He then felt a
sharp pain in his left leg as the youth turned low, cutting
across his thigh and settling into a resting stance.

&quot;Hah, caught you lookin&#39;! This blade is more useful than
I thought...&quot;

Wham. He was knocked to the dirt with a right axe kick, his
face slamming painfully into the ground.

&quot;Do not make light of me, boy... I&#39;ve killed men for less.&quot;
