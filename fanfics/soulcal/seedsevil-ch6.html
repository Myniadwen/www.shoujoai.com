<h1>The Seeds of Evil: Phoenix Rising (part 6 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../soulcal/seedsevil-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>        Men had been beaten and bruised on this day...

       The woman in the cloak had successfully laid a
royal beating on the entire Seung Dojo, and all without delivering
a single cut or fatal wound. Many of the whelps that they had recieved
bore the marks and outline of the blade, turned to its side.

       Even a few broken ribs had been suffered from the
crushing blows of the zanbatoh, and it was now up to the head
of the school, Seung Han Myong, to stop this before it came to
using the blade&#39;s edge. He walked with a calm gait and looked
fearlessly into her eyes.

       &quot;I commend you for showing such skill. Some of my best
were among the young ones that you bested. But this will end here.&quot;

       The woman simply smiled. &quot;You are welcome to try. I
came to see you anyway.&quot; She produced the seven foot zanbatoh
that had become so familiar. The crimson rod... the 22&quot; blade...
the very presence and aura that radiated from the weapon.

       &quot;How did you come across the Scarlet Thunder?
What have you done with my daughter?&quot;

        She smirked, an unseen expression under the hood.
&quot;Nothing that you won&#39;t like, I assure you. Rest assured, she is
alive, well, and healthy. Though she is a bit reluctant about coming
back here.&quot; His body had not tensed in the slightest, but if one
looked closely, an expression of relief had briefly shown itself.

        &quot;Tell me what has become of her, then.&quot;

        Whatever he was expecting, it was not what was happening
before him. The woman took off her hood and moved her hair out
from under the cloak. The long brown locks shone and gleamed in the
sunlight, and her eyes contained a new kind of wisdom that not even
Han Myong could miss.

        &quot;What have you been up to?&quot;

        &quot;Learning, father. Learning everything.&quot;

Chapter 6: Rock the Boat (Pt. 1): Mina and Xian&#39;s Second Night Together
____________________________________________________________________

       Dusk, on a boat headed towards China. The survivors
of the Destruction of the Korean town near Seung Mountain
were on this ship. Many of them had no real purpose, save
that of rebuilding thier lives. However, the lives of two
young women had been refreshed anew.

       They were on a quest with one purpose in mind: find
the six individuals that were key elements to this world&#39;s survival,
and protect them at the cost of thier lives, when the need arose.
Unfortunately, the full measure of this task had fallen on
the older of the two... and her resolve began to waste away.

       &#39;Wow... I&#39;m responsible for finding four other people
who could shape the world&#39;s destiny... It&#39;s not for me. I can&#39;t.
How am I supposed to do this without screwing it up completely? I don&#39;t
think I can...&#39;

        But there were only two who could give advice, and one
was occupued with looking out to sea and letting her thoughts
wander. Of course, Mina knew how to handle the situation, thanks
to her companion&#39;s advice before they boarded the vessel...

       &quot;Hey, about that voice that you&#39;ve been hearing. I used
to hear it, too, before I fully understood the Krita-Yuga. But
Kilik taught me how to silence my thoughts and let my soul speak
for me. No one else can hear it except the person who I&#39;m speaking
to. If you tried that, maybe you&#39;d have an easier time with
whoever&#39;s trying to reach you.&quot;

       &#39;Sure, but how? All you have to do is stare at the sea,
or into the sky, and your mind is unburdened. That doesn&#39;t work
for me.&#39; Because every time her mind wandered, she thought about
home... and Hwang... and worst of all, the mission that was given
to her and Xian.

       In fact, the only time that her mind was empty was when
she fought or trained. She thought with her body, not her mind,
and that made her an extremely skilled and dangerous opponent.
Trusting what she felt, and not what she thought, was her key
to every victory. &#39;Will it work here, too?&#39;

She pulled out the Scarlet Thunder. &#39;I&#39;ll try it. And if it doesn&#39;t
work, at least I&#39;ll get some training in.&#39; She tried to suppress a
yawn, but to no avail. &#39;Maybe tomorrow.&#39; &quot;Hey, Xian! I&#39;m turning
in now.&quot; Xianghua looked over in Mina&#39;s directon and smiled. &quot;Okay.
I&#39;m right behind you.&quot;
____________________________________________________________________

       Night, inside the cabins. Mina had a long day ahead of her
tomorrow, and needed her rest. &#39;I sure hope I can pull it off.&#39;
She shook her head. &#39;No, that&#39;s not right. I KNOW I can do this.
all I have to do is the pattern dance that I learned. It&#39;s good
practice, anyway.&#39; She snuggled into the soft bed, and began to
drift away. &#39;So nice... reminds me of my bed at home.&#39; And then,
all thoughts were washed away by the gentle wave of sleep.

       Of course, her senses had been honed greatly during her
training... so she heard things that no ordinary person could
hear. Heartbeat... breathing... and not just her own... there
was another who had stepped into her room. She heard the soft,
almost timid shuffle of feet... feet that were a little
smaller than most others... closer and closer, until...
the sound stopped near the bed. Mina stayed calm during the
whole ordeal. &#39;If an attack comes, I&#39;ll be ready. For now,
let&#39;s see what you&#39;re up to...&#39;

       She felt the person&#39;s breath on her cheek... then nothing.
Nothing but silence... &#39;This is boring. Do somethin&#39;, already!&#39;
Then, she heard a voice... small, timid, and nervous... &#39;Someone&#39;s
thoughts, maybe? But who could be trying to...&#39; Then she knew.
There was only one person on the ship who could do something like
that.

       Mina opened her eyes and saw the figure of a young woman,
about twenty years old. &#39;And she&#39;s probably naked, too.&#39;
&quot;Hi, Xian.&quot; &quot;Mina... I&#39;m worried.&quot; &#39;About what? Oh, that.&#39; &quot;It&#39;ll
be alright. We&#39;ll make sure they&#39;re safe.&quot;

       &quot;I know that,&quot; She said in what was barely a whisper. &quot;I
was talking about you. You can&#39;t control the full stength of
these weapons without freeing your mind from this world.&quot; Another
confusing concept. &quot;What do you mean, &#39;freeing my mind&#39;?&quot; &quot;I mean
not thinking like everyone else does. Don&#39;t do something for
payment or profit, but just to help. You shouldn&#39;t want anything
for yourself, but for others.&quot;

        Mina was at a loss for words. &quot;But I&#39;ve never done that..&quot;
&quot;Mina, you&#39;re such a bad liar. What about your father?&quot; She cringed.
Xian had hit a nerve- her father and his overly strict handling of
Mina was wearing her thin... and she had come to the breaking point
that evening when she had left. The whole purpouse of this very journey
was to get Yunsung back, but it was only so she could prove that she was
capable enough to handle herself, by herself.

        &quot;Okay, you got me on that one,&quot; she said sheepishly.
&quot;But how am I supposed to do that when no one&#39;s going to help me out?
I mean, I do need help, after all.&quot; Xianghua nodded at this. &quot;That&#39;s
what I&#39;m here for. And whether someone is going to return the favor
should not matter- it&#39;s how it makes you feel.&quot;

        Feelings... well, she remembered being thanked for her
help many times, even if pride had gotten in the way of the people
involved. However grudgingly they said it, they said it none the less.
She couldn&#39;t help but feel a sort of satisfaction that someone&#39;s life
was made easier because of something she did. But then... the battle
resurfaced in her mind.

        She was helping... and everything seemed so wrong then.
An entire town, save for thirty people, slain by one woman. The tale
would spread throughout Korea... she would be feared... and she
suddenly drew back, as if to retreat from the eyes that only she saw,
the fingers that seemed to be pointing to her, the people that were
either running from her, or advaning to attack, thinking that she
was a demon of sorts...

        &quot;Mina?&quot; It was only a whisper, but it broke her trance.
Fresh tears were on her cheeks, and a sob escaped her. &quot;Xian...
what if we have to help... like we did that night? I don&#39;t want to
go through that again. Never again. I-&quot;

        Xian&#39;s arms encircled her, defending her from her
ghosts and demons. Mina relaxed, but only a little. &quot;It&#39;s all right
now, Mina. If we have to do that again, I&#39;ll be there for you. I&#39;ll
always be there for you.&quot; Mina was still doubtful, still tense.
She still heard the cries and screams, but this time, they weren&#39;t
possesed. The cheerful farewells were replaced with curses...

        &quot;Xian... help...&quot;
____________________________________________________________________

        She could do nothing but awnser. &quot;Mina... if you can
hear me, I want you to lie down.&quot; Slowly, hesitantly.. she did
so. Something within her still trusted Xianghua, still heard her
voice. The bond between them was her only life line now, and she
clung to it like she did her weapon at night.

        Without another word, Xianghua began moving her hands
around, feeling for any tension. She felt it everywhere, as if Mina
were ready to lash out with everything she had. The energy that
surged through her begged for release, her fear driving it onward.

        &quot;Mina... please trust me.&quot; A whimper and a nod. She
finally relaxed, though the voices continued to haunt her and
goad her on. Her eyes closed, as if they would shield the noises and
the voices, her ears focused on Xian&#39;s voice, as if it were the
voice of her own mother.

        All at once, Xianghua began to shift and slide her hands
across Mina&#39;s back and shoulders, and the sharp hiss of pain was
enough to bring the voices back to her head. &quot;No! Leave me alone!&quot;
But Xianghua would hear nothing of it. &quot;Shhhh... it&#39;s only for a while.
Just relax... please, let me do this.&quot;

        As she continued, the pain lessened, and something else
slowly took place. The energy that had been stored slowly seeped into
Xianghua, having no other place to go. Giving her strength to do what
she needed to do. A gentle sort of reassurance from Mina, though it
was unconcious.

        And sure enough, the pain was soon replaced by a warmth
that was indescribable. Mina let put her appreciation into form, and
moaned softly, finally relaxing. The voices and cries faded. The
fingers that were pointing at her ceased to be. The people that
were attacking, suddenly stopped and stood there, as if confused about
what they were doing, before dissolving like so much mist in her
mind.

        Her thoughts cleared at once, and Mina had a sudden
realization. If this kept up, she would either fall asleep, or the
situation that she had been thrown into last night would repeat itself.
Not like either situation was bad... but if it were going to be the
second one, which would most likely be the case, she wanted to be
in command.

        She wanted to ignite the same fires of passion that
made her just about attack Xianghua with her embrace and her hunger.
An almost predatory smile formed on her lips as the warmth and the
contact spread through her whole body, and she regained her
confidence. It was time to return the favor.

        Mina controlled her breathing and slowed it to a
lethargic crawl, willing herself to a mock-sleep. Her heart
rate slowed, almost stopping completely. Her eyes were half-lidded,
as if they were weighted with the pleasure that she was recieving
from the massage, then closed entirely.
____________________________________________________________________

        Xian fell for it.

        &quot;Oh, Mina... don&#39;t you go falling asleep on me now!
We were just getting started!&quot; She shook her gently, trying to
rouse her to awareness. In truth, Mina&#39;s moans and near-purrs had
been driving her to the brink, almost forcing her into kissing her
passionately and taking her right there, all for her own.

        Indeed, this act of passion was the main reason she was
here. It had become her strength... literally. Making love to the
one that she really loved seemed to have a healing effect on
her. Her burdens were great as well, and this was the only outlet
she had right now.

        And to do that, she needed her awake.

        However, no amount of poking or prodding could rouse her.
Meaning that she had to give in to her desires a little. It was
selfish, but she needed to have her awake, one way or the other.
Cautiously, she lowered her head to Mina&#39;s left ear and flicked her
tongue out, licking her earlobe.

        Nothing.

        Driven by the chance to live out her fantasies, and
finding her friend to taste very good, she did not stop there.
She gently bit on same said earlobe, pulling it with her teeth.
Surely that would get some kind of moan, a shiver, anything.

        And she was still.

        Okay, this was getting a little frustrating for her.
She decided to quit playing around, and just go for it. She
stuck her tongue directly into her ear, as if it would tell her
some secret that only it knew. That, if anything, would make her
snap to attention.

        Not a movement. Not even a flinch.

        Her frustration was evident now in all her movements.
Just what would it take to wake her up, anyway? Then, she
had it. A devilish smirk appeared on her features as she shifted
Mina&#39;s position so that she was face up, her beautiful body shown
to her.

        Xianghua licked her lips, and all caution was scattered
to the winds. Closing her eyes and channeling her energy, the dew
on her lips began to shine and glow faintly, a sign that they
were more than ready to deliver the promised waves of pleasure.

        Closer... closer... closer still, until their
noses touched. She was just about ready to consume her altogether.

        And then, with a gasp of shock and surprise,
she reared back, but only a little. Mina&#39;s eyes opened, staring
straight into hers. The already deep brown was darkened even further
with passion and desire.

        Everything that she was doing was not in vain.

        She just didn&#39;t know it.
____________________________________________________________________

        &quot;What&#39;s stopping you?&quot; she whispered huskily.

        &quot;Do you have any idea how scared I was? I nearly
jumped out of my skin!&quot; Xian whispered accusingly. Mina smiled.
&quot;Only the guilty are afraid, Chai Xianghua. What do you have to be
guilty of? Trying to pull one over on me while I was asleep?&quot;

        Though she thought that she was no longer capable of
doing so anymore, the former captain blushed. She had no response,
but was still hot and bothered just by looking into her eyes. Mina
noticed this- how could she not, with the pleading expression in
Xianghua&#39;s own eyes?

        &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; she purred. &quot;You need help, don&#39;t you?&quot;
The younger woman only nodded vigorously, not even wanting to tell
the situation, only needing the touch and embrace, and to drown
her doubts and fears in passionate cries. Mina did not speak-
she did not need to. She only kissed her. Gently, but with
all the feeling that she could muster.

        And while she was at it, the piece of Xianghua&#39;s soul
that rested on her lips finally escaped into Mina&#39;s body, sending
the heady waves of passion and euphoria through her. But there was
a mirror to this within Xianghua, as the bond worked its power
over her.

        She moaned into the kiss, and almost melted into
Mina&#39;s hands. She turned her over on her back, and proceeded to
give her the same treatment that she had been given, her fingers
sinking into her skin and washing any thoughts that were left
within her away.

        &quot;Minaaa..&quot; Her sigh was not unnoticed, and it triggered
a more enthusiastic response, as the young prodigy eagerly got
to work on her back and shoulders, hands moving further than
Xianghua&#39;s had gotten. Soon, at the command of the woman beneath
her, she would move to a certain spot, and wash the tension away.

        &quot;Lower... a little more... (hissss) aaah! There!
Yes, right there... mmmm...&quot; She grinned like a giddy child
who had just discovered some secret, as she continued her motions,
groping and working at the tension, the pain instantly replaced
with pleasure. The combination of the two elements did something
facinating.

        They lit Xianghua up like a set of festival fireworks.

        It was all she could do not to simply turn herself
over and consume the young Seung with her now stoked flames. But
she persisted, and was almost literally putty in Mina&#39;s hands.
It only served to intensify her need for the passionate woman
above her, but she would not be selfish and take her for herself.
No, not yet. She would wait until she was done.

        But it took everything within her to control
her urges, as her thoughts faded- even any coherent speech was
beginning to fade, until she only knew one word.

        The name of her lover, who was giving her the
most decadent torture that anyone could give, just through
a massage. If she kissed her- anywhere - she would lose the battle
between her mind and her emotions.
____________________________________________________________________

        She cried her name out with every breath, as if
the name itself were the air she breathed. Mina smirked. Yes,
she was almost broken. Her will was barely there- that was evident
by the lack of vocabulary. &#39;Yeah, and once she breaks, I&#39;ll let
her have what she wants. It&#39;s the thing that she did to me,
not too long ago, after all.&#39;

        As if the thought iself were a que, Mina felt her wrists
being grabbed, stopping all motion from her. &quot;What, you don&#39;t want
anymore?&quot; Xianghua was slient, only shaking her head. Her response
was quick and to the point, as if she were responding to her master.

        &quot;Then what do you want?&quot; Xianghua&#39;s whimper was
almost pained. How could she ask such a thing, when she plainly
knew what she wanted? Mina shook her head. &quot;I can&#39;t hear you.
You&#39;re gonna have to speak, so that I know what you want.&quot; She
growled dangerously, a warning that if she did not stop playing
these games, it was going to get violent. Very much so.

        &quot;Say it.&quot; Her anger was fading fast, into a submissiveness
that was overwhelming. Only one whisper was uttered, as much of a
confession as it was an admittance of defeat. Not like this defeat
was painful or shameful. In fact, it felt right to speak of her
one desire, though it was in a whisper.

        &quot;You.&quot;

        &quot;What about me? And speak louder; I can&#39;t really hear-&quot;

         Louder, and with her voice laced with fire and passion,
&quot;I want you, Mina, and don&#39;t you dare ask how.&quot; She smirked, and
decided that one more push was needed. &quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t be
ashamed of it, if I were you. Let everyone hear what you want.
Scream for me.&quot; And with one last, desperate cry, all her
inhibitions were thrown out the window.

        &quot;I WANT YOU, SEUNG MINA!!&quot;

        A satisfied smirk crossed her features. Yes, she was
broken, and now needed to be repaired in the only possible- and
obvious - method left. And they were lucky that no one had heard the
passionate cry, either. People would get suspicious; not like
that mattered. She lay out on the bed provocatively, no longer
teasing, but finally offering herself, like a cool drink of
water after a long, hard, and grueling race.

        &quot;You have me, then.&quot;
____________________________________________________________________

        Demanding, insistant, and to-the-point.

        Xianghua did not come to Mina with a slow, deliberate
pace. She outright attacked her, with all the passion she had
been collecting. Hands were immediately on her breasts, teasing and
kneading. Lips were crushed against one another, the heat from the
kiss radiating from both body and soul. With every movement of her
tongue, Xianghua felt her need being satisfied, and yet it rose at
the same time, demanding more of her.

        And from Mina&#39;s reactions to her touches, which
seemed as if her fingertips were ablaze, she was getting what she
wanted. The older of the two was shivering from every touch, every
heated breath that passed against her skin. As Xian&#39;s hands moved
from her breasts to her sides, never leaving her skin, Mina sighed
lovingly. Breaking Xian&#39;s self-control was indeed a good idea.

        The kisses (and gentle, but passionate bites) to
Mina&#39;s neck were having a sedative effect on her, rendering her
immobile through sheer bliss. She could still move, mind you.
She just didn&#39;t see the need to, when her friend was gladly
recieving the comfort that this evening offered. In essence, she
allowed her to explore every inch of her, with hands and lips.

        As she continued on her quest for satisfaction, she
began abandoning her hands and simply used her mouth, her tongue
making a slick and burning trail up and down her neck, licking it with
slow, deliberate strokes, as if to taste all of the skin at once.
It seemed that she couldn&#39;t get enough of her brown-haired friend.

        As she moved toward her collarbone, now tired of
staying in one spot, Mina moaned and sighed her appreciations,
snatches of the woman&#39;s name who was giving her these attentions
floating into the air, sometimes cut off midway by a sharp intake
of air.

        Xianghua was now advancing on Mina&#39;s ample bosom,
and wasted no time in making her lips felt, now using her hands out of
necessity alone. As one arm stretched towards Mina&#39;s head, just to run
her hand through the silken locks, the other focused on getting
the unattended breast to a feverish ache, fondling and squeezing it
playfully. But it seemed that she needed a little help, and Mina,
mostly from the pleasure and intensity of the moment, arched her back,
pressing her breasts further into Xian&#39;s mouth and hands.

        Apparently, this was enough for Xianguha, who had just
started to pull on the nipple with her lips, sometimes with her teeth,
insisting that the essence that they held within be given freely.
But all she got was a very sensitive nipple. Which was a good sign
that she was finished with that teat, and could move to the other.

        The breast that had been fondled and stroked lovingly
was aching for something other than hands and fingers, and Xian
obliged happily, bringing a heady sensation to Mina. She pressed her
hand to the back of the young lover&#39;s head, just to get her closer.
Just to at least feel one with her, and more than just in spirit.

        Satisfied that she had done a good number in that area,
she moved down to Mina&#39;s stomach and pressed her lips to the soft
skin time after time, each kiss inviting a moan or gasp. At
the same time, her hands had gotten back to work again, the
fingers playing across the inner curves of Mina&#39;s thighs. That
alone was a sign that things were about to end quickly.

        Mina couldn&#39;t wait for it.

        &quot;Take me, Xian.... now, please!&quot;

        Mina, however, didn&#39;t even have to say anything.
Xianghua could feel her need- it screamed to her from every angle
to feast on her; to make her cry out with passion and satisfaction.
Just the thought of such a thing was undeniable- the master had to
be awnsered! She immediately and hungrily thrust her tongue inside
of her, taking the juices for herself.

        If she had not bitten down on her bottom lip,
Mina&#39;s scream of extacy would have awakened the dead, even at the
depths of the sea. Her body shivered with the waves of electricity,
as her blood boiled and her body went rigid. She tried to hold on,
just for her. She tried so hard... but it would be just a
matter of time before the scream was let out.

        And with a ragged cry, she let her appreciation
be heard, no longer able to hold back the waves of heated sensation
as her world turned white... Xianghua held her close, letting the
cry play and ring in her ears, the heat rage through her, the
sheer feeling of Mina coming under her bring her to a strange
extacy...

        The fact that she came mere moments later was enough
evidence that the bond between them was working. They bathed in the
afterglow, the heat still burning and the pleasure washing through
them, bringing their true words to the surface...

        &quot;Mina, thank you. I really needed that. I mean really.&quot;

        She smiled at this, but was curious to know what had
started this, though it was... &quot;It was incredible, Xian. I just
hope it helped any. But what I want to know is, what really
brought you down here?&quot;

        Xianghua was silent for a few moments, letting the heat
pass through the air, and her thoughts with it.

        &quot;Later, Mina. I promise, I&#39;ll tell you later.&quot;

        She had to be content wtih that, as sleep took over.
____________________________________________________________________

        The night was ending, and it was a surprise that
no one had rushed down to their room to see what the commotion was
about. Perhaps there was someone watching over them after all.

        In any event, the two of them could be seen lying
peacefully beside each other, in a warm and loving embrace. And
it seemed, by the smiles on their faces, that it would be enough
for now.
