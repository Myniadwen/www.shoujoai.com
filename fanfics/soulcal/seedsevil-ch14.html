<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../soulcal/seedsevil-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>passion- n.

1. A powerful emotion such as love, joy, hatred, or anger.

3a. Boundless Enthusiasm.

4. An abandoned display of emotion.

Passion is a powerful, deep emotion... one that is usually
unbridled or unrestrained. But the synonym of Fire is both
similar and drasticly different. Passion is usually
something that is limited to only one thing or person. Fire
is similar- a passion that burns- but different in the fact
that it is applied to most anything and everything in life.

Period.

The Flames of Passion
___________________________________________________________

The two of them were back in the inn, Xianghua still
unconcious.

Mina had fallen into a deep and troubled sleep, one that
she had cried herself into over the events of the afternoon.
In her own mind, she had been completely and utterly useless
in the fact that she could not help her friends at all, one
of which was the most important person in her life- the
other whom she had taken in as a student of sorts.

The men who were responsible floated in her mind for
the rest of the evening... and slowly, something within
her stirred.

She was angry. He completely ignored her! How dare he do
such a thing? If it weren&#39;t for the fact that her friends
were in pain or out cold, she would&#39;ve torn into them like
no tomorrow...

She was in pain. Seeing Xianghua&#39;s bruise made it seem
like she herself had been hit instead of Xian... and seeing
Talim passed out, only to be used as a bargaining chip,
made something within her tighten, as if a string were winding
around her soul.

She hated the thieves which had stolen her love and her friend,
and wanted nothing more than to get them back and destroy them
before such incidents happened again.

And then the voice. The calm, measured voice that rang out
like a bell. Mina had heard it before... for some odd reason,
she welcomed it. She did not turn this voice away this time.

(You are in pain.)

A slight sympathetic tone behind it- though this was the voice
of a weapon, it cared for its master. Protected it. Defended it.
Mina could&#39;ve smirked at this. It was all too obvious, but
she wouldn&#39;t have admitted it to anyone. She did not want to be
seen as weak.

However...

(Yes. What of it?)

(I can take it away.)

(Can you? I don&#39;t see how anyone would want to, since I
had failed.)

The voice was silent for a moment, but Mina didn&#39;t care. She
locked herself in the darkness, in the pain. Xianghua couldn&#39;t
help... no, she was out of it for at least a day, maybe two.

Then, the Scarlet Thunder whispered again.

(What would take your pain away?)

She didn&#39;t have to think twice.

(Power. Power to defend Xian and Talim. Power to defeat any
who would hurt them. Power to show my father and Hwang that
I am not some trinket to be given away, or some rock that
one can walk past and ignore.)

For some odd reason, the voice changed. One that had a
somewhat odd tone to it, as if something were beginning.

(Is that what you would ask of me?)

Mina&#39;s mind screamed. She would&#39;ve lied about it, were she
awake and concious about what she were saying... but thoughts
in their purest form do not lie.

(Yes!)

(There is no turning back, once you have walked down the
path before you. Your decision is final?)

(Yes! I want the strength to protect my friends!)

The whisper turned into a shout, a confirmation.

(So be it!)

And then, she burned. Just like before... just like back
at home... Something was stirring inside of her- a raging
torrent of pure, cleansing flames.

Was this her soul?

She had no time to think, as a scream of pain began to rise
inside of her throat.

(Your body, in its current state, cannot handle it, no
matter how hard you train or focus your mind. I am sorry,
but I cannot help you with that right now. But when the
time comes, I will be able to do something. For
now...)

Then, everything else was blocked out, as Mina let out a
cry of agony...

Only to wake up in a cold sweat.

(A dream... but the fire was so damn real! Could that be..)

But she shook her head to clear it out. The possibility
that it was a dream was not in her mind at the moment...
It was far too real for her own tastes. No, the weapon,
her weapon, was trying to give her what she asked.

(Your body, it its current state, cannot handle it, no
matter how hard you train...)

Tears formed in her eyes again. No, that couldn&#39;t be
true! If it were, all those years were for nothing!
Was she to simply wait until it was time?

Then, she looked at Xianghua, who looked so peaceful.

Yes, she was to wait. And she would, if only for her
and Talim...
___________________________________________________________

Darkness. Emptiness. Her body would not move, no matter
how hard her mind tried to move it.

(No! What&#39;s going on? What happened?)

She could remember nothing, save for the prick to the back
of her neck, followed by something reminiscent of ice water
flowing through her veins. Before that, she had run off
with Xianghua to safety... only to be stopped by someone
who was easily five times her size and weight. It felt
like running into a wall of steel...

And he looked about as smart as one as well.

Nonetheless, he managed to take out Xianghua... and then,
the train of thoughts stopped there as the feeling of
ice water coursed through her.

(Something inside me... is doing this. Those darts were...)

And then, another, more disturbing thought came to mind.

(Xianghua! Mina! Are they all right?)

Blindly, she struggled for a way to seek such things out,
to know for certain where they were. Her most available
route, the wind, was out of the question- as
far as she could tell, anyway.

But then, she felt it. Or rather, her.

Mina had left a part of herself in her mind- a part
that had not been used recently, seeing as Mina had no
reason to check on her, assuming that they would be all
right.

Well, she wasn&#39;t, and she had to let someone know.

She reached for it- the thin string of Mina&#39;s energy
that was within her mind- almost imperceptible, but it
was there. She finally took hold of it, and her mind
cried out, hoping that she would hear.

(Mina!)
___________________________________________________________

An unknown location, somewhere in Peking Docks...

&quot;You&#39;re sure this is one of them?&quot;

Tashiro nodded. He was definitely, most assuredly positive
about this young woman. Because what he found on her was
most intriguing...

&quot;I found this on her.&quot;

He brought forth a piece of metal, glowing with a bright
crimson aura. As soon as he did, heads turned in its
direction, millions of pairs of eyes gazing at it hungrily.

&quot;I see. And you are sure that the other two will come
for her, as soon as they are able?&quot;

He nodded again.

&quot;I am confident that all three of those shards will be
yours, with the promise of more.&quot;

He nodded, stroking his beard thoughtfully.

&quot;Very good. You have done well. Now, all we have to do is
wait for them, and have them hand the pieces over either
willingly... or in blood.&quot;

He looked at the young woman shrewdly.

&quot;Her blood first... then theirs.&quot;
___________________________________________________________

Xianghua was swimming in darkness. She remembered seeing
a huge, ham-sized fist headed towards her with remarkable
speed. She couldn&#39;t dodge in time- it was a swift attack,
for such a big man.

When she was knocked out, she was fortunate enough to
not feel herself behing hoisted up, or being dumped
uncerimoniously onto the ground below minutes later.

She was all too lucky that she did not see the pained
expression on Mina&#39;s face, or the sadness and anger that
suddenly suffused her aura with a ferocity similar to an
attack.

But she was not spared the mental link between the two
of them... no, the three of them. She may not have heard
or seen, or felt pain, but she did feel something.

(Mina! Mina, I&#39;m so sorry, it&#39;s all my fault, I-)

Then, she realized, after finding the part of Mina that
was inside of her, that her friend could not hear. She
was too far gone in anger and sadness to listen to
anyone but her opponent.

(You.. can&#39;t hear me, can you?)

She could, however, hear Talim. Talim was calm,
surprisingly cool under everything that was happening.
Xian imagined that, if she could, Talim was smiling.

(Don&#39;t worry about me- I&#39;ll be fine. Just look
after Mina. And whatever you do... do not give them
what they are looking for.)

Of course. The shards that they had- they already had
one of each... Oh, no. If they had Talim, They had one of
the shards! If that were the case, then they were going to
want more, and would stop at nothing to get them all!

(We&#39;ll get you back! I swear, we&#39;ll get you back!)

Then, everything else was blocked out, as a flood of
anguish came from her older friend, who thought herself
as a failure, due to her inability to be in two places at
once.

It was impossible. But she cried anyway.

(Oh, Mina...)
___________________________________________________________

It was near the evening when Mina finally woke up. She
rubbed the sleep out of her eyes and looked around the
room, only to see Xianghua, still out cold. Well, not
unconcious, but sleeping, perhaps.

She also noticed that the bruise was still there...

(One that I could&#39;ve avoided.)

With a look of sadness in her eyes, she did what her first
instinct told her to do. She didn&#39;t even doubt that it
wouldn&#39;t work- she just did it.

She placed one of her hands on the bruise and channeled
her energy toward it, trying to make the swelling go
down somewhat. Her hand began to shine with a bright red
aura, and she felt the energy draining from her into
Xian.

(Ugh... any more, and I&#39;ll be asleep again.)

She pulled away and examined the bruised cheek.

Nothing there. It was gone!

For some odd reason, she didn&#39;t feel so tired anymore.
Well, her body was, but her mind was not. She suddenly
found that she could help, even if things didn&#39;t turn out
as they should all the time.

Better still was the fact that Xianghua&#39;s eyes now fluttered
open sleepily, as if she hadn&#39;t been knocked unconcious at
all. As her vision cleared and she looked up, she saw Mina,
whose eyes were brimming with tears at the mere sight of her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said weakly. &quot;I couldn&#39;t protect her from
them.&quot;

At this point, Mina did cry, and held Xian close. She
thought to herself that she must&#39;ve been going crazy-
she cried more times today than when she was a little child,
and over a bruise and someone she barely knew being kidnapped.

But for Mina, things had changed.

&quot;It&#39;s my fault, Xian. If I hadn&#39;t been so into fighting
that lunatic with the claws, I could&#39;ve-&quot;

If Xian had the strength to, she would&#39;ve slapped her.
Instead, she put a finger to Mina&#39;s lips and smiled.

&quot;Don&#39;t ever say that again. You were fighting so that
we could get away. From that point, I made it my
responsibility to protect Talim, even though she
handled herself very well back there.&quot;

She dried the tears from Mina&#39;s eyes with said same
finger, the tired smile never leaving.

&quot;I&#39;d rather we just get her back, and forget this
happened... because if we don&#39;t, something worse is going
to happen.&quot;

Mina&#39;s eyes widened. She now remembered why it was so
important to defend Talim, besides the obvious mental
link, and the fact that she had taken a liking to her.

&quot;The shards! Soul Edge!&quot;

Xian simply nodded.

It was then that Mina heard a ringing, clear voice in
her head- one that by now was unmistakable.

(Mina!)

She almost jumped in surprise and joy. Talim was alive.
___________________________________________________________

Iron Bear had placed her gently (Which was surprising, for
one of his size and intelligence) on the bed in one of the
best and most comfortable rooms in the entire building.

For some odd reason, it was lavishly decorated and had
the light scent of perfume in the air. Someone was already
here, apparently. However, a still comatose Talim saw none
of this.

In any case, he was told specificly to make her an
&quot;honored guest&quot; instead of a hostage, and by the boss
himself at that. Well, she did look cute, and seemed full
of fire and spirit.

He grinned maliciously at this. He had broken girls with
fire and spirit before, and the ones that were coming
this way were no different. All he had to do was wait for
them.

He looked over at her again, and smiled.

&quot;I&#39;ll have my fun with you later, pretty thing. For now,
I must wait for your feeble saviors...&quot;

With that, the big man left.
___________________________________________________________

After telling her about the situation, Mina&#39;s mood had
gone from passive... to bad... to worse... and finally,
she was angry again.

(Don&#39;t you worry, Talim. We&#39;ll get you back from those
monsters.)

Mina could almost see Talim&#39;s frown, but didn&#39;t care.

(Don&#39;t call them that. They are frustrated that someone
or something is taking their place... time is changing,
and they do not want to change. They believe that honor
will be lost if the world does not stay as it is.)

Xianghua was impressed. Apparently, she knew more than
she had let on about the state of the world at this time.
But she kept her thoughts to herself, and listened instead.

Mina, however, was shocked out of her anger.

(Huh? How do you know?)

If she were in front of them, Talim would&#39;ve smiled.

(The wind tells me everything. I can hear it... not just
in my ears anymore, but in my heart. In my soul. Mina, I
understand, just a little. It&#39;s my own spirit that lets me
hear the wind&#39;s voice, even when I&#39;m unconcious...)

Mina could&#39;ve smiled if the situation were not so grave.

(What&#39;re they saying?)

(They&#39;re all on edge.. telling stories of how they used
to be samurai, each working for their lord and such.
Then, they were banned to carry a sword, and everything
started to change... firearms replaced swords and bows.
According to them, battles started to lose their honor.)

She was reminded of a certain man in red armor who said
all that... and suddenly, she was disgusted.

Xianghua felt it too- her frustration that people could
not simply lay down their swords and live their lives.
It was indeed sick that they wanted- no, needed to fight.

Well, if they wanted a fight, they would get one.

Thier last one.

(I think they&#39;re going to use Soul Edge to throw
the world into turmoil, even more so than right now...)

Her voice- or thoughts, if one wanted to get technical-
began to waver with fear.

(Mina... I&#39;m scared... Scared of what else they&#39;re
saying. They&#39;re saying that I look good... I don&#39;t
like how they say it, though... I don&#39;t like their
eyes...)

Mina&#39;s eyes widened. Her pulse quickened. Her hands
balled into fists, the knuckles turning white.

And something burned.

(I&#39;m scared...)
___________________________________________________________

Talim finally awakened in her room.

Well, not her room exactly, but one that smelled lightly of
perfume and such. Mina&#39;s presence was still in her mind,
albeit much weaker than before. None the less, it was still
there, and she was comforted, just a little.

She would admit though, that she would be more comfortable
if she were here in front of her. She had been alone for
most of her life; her mother and father were not even
allowed in the temple back at home. She had accepted that,
however.

But now that she was used to having someone around... more
than one someone... two people who cared for her enough to
die for her... she didn&#39;t want to be alone anymore.

And when she thought of them, both of them, something
stirred within. A longing- something that was necessary for
her. Her soul cried out for them- her two friends.

(This is... what is this? I felt so much safer when I
thought about them just now. And I felt warm... Is this is
what they call love? I don&#39;t know... I&#39;ve never felt this
way for anyone, not even mama... everyone was always so
distant to me at the village.

I never had any real friends... and even
I know that this is not how friends should feel to each
other! Is this right? Is this the way things should be?)

She finally asked herself the question that she had
denied to adress- the one thing that had been pulling at
her for the longest time.

(Do I love Mina and Xianghua?)

As if it were a sort of trigger, she heard it from outside
her room.

&quot;Intruders! Only two of them, but we won&#39;t take our
chances. Stay here and protect our guest at all costs. The
boss won&#39;t be happy if she&#39;s not here!&quot;

Talim closed her eyes and sat down on her knees, her hands
folded in her lap. The air around her was suddenly charged
with her energy, and she sent it forth with a message.

(I&#39;m here... come and find me.)
____________________________________________________________

A few hours earlier, Mina had jumped out of the window that
was just next to her room, like earlier that day, and
began following what she was convinced was Talim&#39;s presence,
using the mental link to track her down. The shards of Soul
Edge were another target, but it was for later.

Xianghua ran after her, concerned about the state in which
her friend was in. She made no move to deviate from the
path that Mina was on. Even if she had, the aura of barely
concealed anger was like a warning bell.

People seemed to move out of her way, as if they could feel
her aura as well, or at least see it in her eyes. By the
way, the color of her eyes had turned from a soft brown
to a bright, shining green.

But that was not the most noticable thing about her.
For some odd reason, the air temperature had been steadily
rising, and the focal point was the woman who was headed
for what she believed to be the stronghold for the local
pirates.

(Mina, what is going on? You&#39;re... well, not you.)

She would&#39;ve been wrong. It was Mina. It was just that her
anger was starting to show itself in an actual, physical
form. And Mina&#39;s spirit was one of fire... thus, this
was the result.

&quot;Mina, hold up! Where are you going? Awnser me, Min-&quot;

The woman clad in red, and just about to burst into
flames, turned around and presented her gleaming, burning
green eyes to Xianghua.

As soon as she did, the air cooled, just a little, and she
smiled.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Xian. Trust me, okay?&quot;

And it was all she said before she turned around and
continued walking. As she walked away, she added,

&quot;You can come if you wish. Get the fragments of the
sword and Talim out of there as soon as you can.
I&#39;ll provide a... distraction.&quot;

Xianghua could almost feel the evil, wicked smirk that
came from Mina, but did not see it. She was worried none
the less. The green eyes were not hers, and the command
of fire was not hers.

It had to be the weapon, and the weapon responded to
the will of the user. Was Mina&#39;s wish destruction, then?
Was everyone going to die where they stood if they got
in her way?

If that were the case, then she may as well do what
she could.

(Don&#39;t you get yourself killed or hurt...)
____________________________________________________________

The two guards that were on duty scared most people away.

Their job was easy- they didn&#39;t even have to draw their
weapons all that much. So when a woman approached them this
evening wielding a zanbatoh and looking very ready to
fight approached, they did not worry all that much.

They should&#39;ve.

&quot;Oi miss, what&#39;s a pretty little thing like you doing out
this late?&quot;

The other guard smirked at her.

&quot;And with a weapon that size? I&#39;m surprised you can even
carry the thing.&quot;

The woman said something entirely different in response,
her tone measured and calm. This should be a bad sign, as
far as this woman was concerned.

&quot;I&#39;m here because you have someone in there who&#39;s important
to me. Now, you have two choices... get out of the way, or
die quickly and painfully.&quot;

The two guards looked at each other for a full three seconds,
then slowly looked back at the woman before them... and
laughed, long and hard.

&quot;Hahahahahaha! You&#39;re a good one, really! I never heard such
a funny joke! But seriously, why not just go home and-&quot;

The man was silenced by the blade of the zanbatoh.. no, the
kwandao.. piercing through his gut. The blade, which radiated
an otherworldy heat, burned him from the inside out.

The other guard looked on in shock... then anger... then
he attacked.

&quot;You BITCH!! DIE!&quot;

The woman swung the long-handled broadsword with a speed
that was surreal, turning her back and coming around with
the fine edge heading out of the man the hard way, and
slashing towards his ribs.

He didn&#39;t last long, and was cut clean through. No scream-
he was in such pain that he couldn&#39;t scream. It wasn&#39;t so
funny now, was it? On top of that, her hair had turned
from its usual brown to a fiery red. The air around
her was now at such a temperature, she was a danger
to those that dared come close enough.

One could almost see bursts of flame surrounding her,
as if newly awakening. But when she stretched her arm in
front of her and the air around said arm ignited at her will,
the flames whirling around her arm but never touching her, one
had reason to be afraid.

Very afraid.

(Okay Xian, here comes your distraction. Use it well.)

Her arm recoiled as the flames came to a point just three
inches in front of her hand, and her mind released the
burning sphere towards the gates that barred the docks.

Wait a minute... what gates?

Boom.
____________________________________________________________

A resounding blast was heard all over the docks. Everyone
who wasn&#39;t on edge was, and those that already were were
now on full alert, drawing their weapons and rushing towards
the source of the racket.

There were three however, that were niether on edge, nor
worried. They were all the picture of calm, as if knowing
that things would happen like they were.

Fang grinned wolfishly, and Bear only smirked.

&quot;She&#39;s here... Hee hee hee! I can&#39;t wait to finish what we
started back there!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t bother... no one&#39;s getting past me,&quot; Iron Bear
boasted. But his boasting was justified- the big man was
like a wall of steel, despite his size, and he was also
rediculously fast. Quite possibly one of the fiercest
warriors amongst the pack of brigands, and one of the
rudest as well.

But no one dare said that to his face.

Tashiro said nothing- only looked into the distance. She
was coming for him, and these two were only obstacles
that could either be circled around, climbed over, dug
under, or punched through.

He figured that if the resounding blast was her entering
the docks by force, the latter was to happen, and niether
of them could stop her from doing it. The fire in her eyes
was directed to him, and one way or the other, she would
be rid of him.

That was, if she won.

(The other one will probably be the one after the girl.
We can&#39;t let her leave.)

&quot;You two have to take care of the other one that&#39;s
probably going to be with her. She will be after our
honored guest, and that must not happen.&quot;

&quot;What, that little thing?&quot; Bear laughed haughtily.
&quot;She fell to one swing. She&#39;s no problem. I&#39;ll take her.&quot;

&quot;See that you do. Because if she gets past you and into
that room, you will wish you were dead. Fang!&quot;

His head snapped toward Tashiro, more of an animal-like
motion than a human one. His eyes showed unrestrained
insanity, and at best, his superior&#39;s voice barely
registered.

&quot;You are to secure the entrance to the main hall.
It&#39;s her life or yours.&quot;

He almost giggled gleefully. &quot;More hers than mine.
I&#39;m going to make her beg for Hell!&quot;

&quot;Actions Fang, not words.&quot;
____________________________________________________________

Xianghua casually stalked her way through the docks,
keeping a low profile. If she was going to get the shards,
she was going to do so without any fuss. So far, she was
doing relatively well, and her Krita-Yuga had kept mostly
quiet, only glowing faintly as she got closer to the
supposed location.

Suddenly, something from her right, around the corner!
She quickly focused her energy into the sword, and as it
pulsed to life, her body&#39;s strength doubled. She jumped up
to the roof of the nearby warehouse with ease, just when
the two pirates on patrol came around the corner.

As she landed on the roof without a sound, she listened
closely.

&quot;You hear somethin&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Yeah... the wind sure is acting wierd tonight, though.
Wonder what it could be?&quot;

&quot;Hmm.. I should probably get some sleep. I can almost hear
a voice...&quot;

The other guard stared at his friend and shook his head.

&quot;Yeah, you do need sleep. Both of us.&quot;

As they passed by, Xian released the breath that she didn&#39;t
know she was holding. Voices on the wind, eh?

She strained her ears to hear what exactly was going on,
and thought she heard something... She continued to focus,
tuning everything else out, ignoring the guards down there
for a while so she could listen.

And as she did so, she heard it. A whisper on the wind-
one that sounded remarkably like..

&quot;I&#39;m here... come and find me.&quot;

Talim. She was close... either that, or her command of
the winds was first-rate, for her to send a message that
far. But the sword was now pulsing, shaking slightly as
if it were ready to fly in a certain direction.

No, it could not sense shards on her own person- she
already had one, and apparently Mina had one as well. Talim
had two, so they should be... Xianghua raised the Krita-Yuga
and allowed it to point in the direction that the shards
were.

Apparently, they were just two buildings away.

The guards below were pretty much ignorant of her presence
still, which was good for her. But now was not the time
for pride- she had to get the shards. One, she already had,
and the other she had taken from Raphael when she had beaten
him at the tournament.

She leapt from the roof that she was on, the divine weapon
giving her strength, and landed on the next roof in a run.
It was a wonder that she didn&#39;t make noise, but to her
credit, she made none. And then with two long strides, she
jumped again, turning a neat spiral in the air, only to land
on the roof of the warehouse that held the shards.

Her weapon almost sang in fear...

(Yup, this is the place. Now then, there had better be a
back entrance... because the front seems heavily guarded.)

That it was... as she looked straight down, two guards
armed with katanas and wakizashis- that could apparently
be dual wielded- stood attentively at the door, more
alert than the others.

She slinked along the roof, looking for another way in,
and as she looked down the left side of the roof, she
found what she was looking for. A side door. Not exactly
the best way to enter, but it would do...

She hung from the roof, let herself down, and opened
the sliding door as soundlessly as possible, closing it
behind her as she entered.

(All right... where are you?)
____________________________________________________________

Screams of death. Cries of pain.

None of them matched the pain within her- not nearly.
She wanted to see Talim again, sure... but these guys
needed to learn respect and manners. They could do so in
the next life, for all she cared, because she was not
concerned about the sanctity of life anymore.

Still keeping tabs on her mental link between herself and
Xianghua- not to mention Talim, who seemed to be speaking
through the various winds that swept through the now heated
night air, she walked forward, not bothering to watch for
anyone approaching.

She didn&#39;t need to watch, really. She knew they were there,
hiding like the insolent cowards they were. She could almost
smell their fear.

(Too bad. You should&#39;ve thought about that before you
decided to piss me off!)

One behind her, two from the side. Two ahead. She didn&#39;t
care how she could sense them- how the energy signatures
simply picked up in her head. All she knew was that they
were there, and they were armed.

&quot;Stop hiding. It&#39;s no use anyway.&quot;

They came forth, all five surrounding her. One of them decided
to get brave and spoke up.

&quot;It was foolish to come in alone.. you may have gotten this
far, but it ends here. Did you really think you could mess
with us, little gir-&quot;

It began quickly.

Mina turned her back to the man who was speaking and slammed
the back end of the polearm into his shin, while slamming her
heel into the man who was in front of her. While both of them
were now in pain from a broken nose and shin, respectively,
Mina began twirling the kwandao over her head expertly...

Before cutting to her right side, and straight into the
assailant. More spinning, and a cut to the left, her blade
red with heat. Another successful attack, and the pain
was intense.

Then, she swung the weapon back and forth, slamming the flat
of the heated blade on both of their heads, twice each. Four
were down... then up again as she stomped the ground, and
after taking the weapon in one hand and dipping low, swung
upwards in a full circle.

With such a forceful swing, the air around her ignited, and
her blade created a trail of flames that circled along with
the blade&#39;s path. Thus, not only were they fatally wounded,
but were also burned alive...

The fifth man, deciding to attack now, rushed Mina headlong
towards her back as she walked away.

He didn&#39;t even get so far as five steps before Mina
kicked out behind her, her heel slamming into his gut and
making him fly a good six feet backwards, along with a trail
of fire that shot outwards from the path of the kick.

His screams of agony went unnoticed as she continued on,
the heated air starting to ignite anything around her in
a path of destruction.

(They will all suffer for what they have done anyway. So
I&#39;ll let them burn... If they&#39;re smart, they&#39;ll run.
If not, they die. Either way, they&#39;re all cowards in
the end.

Besides... they hurt Talim and Xianghua. My Talim...
my Xian...)

The flames around her seemed to brighten, as a fit of anger
came over her.

(Yes... they will burn for this.)
____________________________________________________________

In the storage room, Xianghua&#39;s sword was shining brightly
while she was busy tearing apart the room in as quiet
a fashion as possible. She was just about to give up when
she walked away from the spot she stood on...

And the aura got just a little fainter.

(Huh?)

She walked back, and it was at full tilt. Xianghua smiled.

(Clever. You guys aren&#39;t as dumb as I thought at first.)

She casually cut a rectangle in the floor and kicked it in,
cringing at the noise.

&quot;What was that?&quot;

&quot;It came from in there. Check it out; if there&#39;s someone
in there, kill them. Don&#39;t bother keeping anyone who is
after our treasure alive.&quot;

&quot;Aye!&quot;

(Oh, hell...)

She found the red box that the shards were supposedly in,
and ran out of the back entrance, closing it quickly and
leaping up to the roof, just as the two guards came crashing
in with weapons drawn.

&quot;What? Nothing?&quot;

&quot;No... someone was here, all right.&quot;

The guard pointed at the rectangle that was sliced into the
floor, and the box that was supposed to be there, though he
knew not how. The one who had placed the damned thing
there had done so without anyone looking- that
someone could find it was a feat in itself.

&quot;Put the patrols on the roofs as well. We have someone who
is looking for a swift death.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll send the word.&quot;

But Xianghua was already heading towards the sighing of the
winds that oddly sounded like voices, telling her to follow.
What was at the end of the path was beyond her, but for
once, she was willing to take things on faith.

She hoped that Talim was still all right...
____________________________________________________________

Speaking of Talim, she was deep in meditation, trying to
filter out any unneeded thoughts, save for the ones that
kept her alive.

(They will come. Keep sending the message, and they will
come.)

She repeated that thought like a mantra, never stopping
her mindset that she was going to get out of this with
their help. However, as she door slid open, she was
pretty much running low on time.

Bear was entering the room again, and it looked like he
was frustrated with having such a lovely lady in the
building without anything to do.

So frustrated, he was thinking about breaking the rules.

&quot;Hmm... aren&#39;t you the pretty little thing. It looks
like your saviors were imaginary after all. Never mind
the deaths that were caused... any sacrifice is necessary
for our world.&quot;

She kept her eyes closed, the calm visage on her face
never wavering. She said nothing- would not give this
dumb-as-a-brick lecher the honor of hearing her voice.

&quot;Oh, no words, huh? Well, words aren&#39;t needed for what I&#39;m
going to do to you. Just relax...&quot;

He began walking toward her, taking his sweet time..

&quot;It might even feel good after a while.&quot;

She simply sat there, acting meek and docile.

&quot;Good girl, you&#39;re just going to sit and take it. I like
that. Like I said, you&#39;ll get used to it for a whi-&quot;

As soon as he touched her shoulder, a gale force wind slammed
into him from the front, pushing even a big man like him a
good seven feet from her.

&quot;You bitch, you were setting me up!&quot;

&quot;I did nothing of the sort,&quot; her clear, bell-like voice spoke.
&quot;My Goddess protects me, and I have faith in Her. You, with
your unclean mind, cannot hurt me, for I am the wind itself.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t give a damn... I&#39;m through playing nice with you!&quot;

This time, he lunged towards her, but the winds beat at him
again, punching into him as if there were physical fists
beating at him. But they only slowed him down, as they
were meant to...

And Talim was running out of energy to use. Not faith,
mind you... just energy. Her strength came from the
Wind Goddess, and She would not fail her.

But right now, there was only one prayer...

(Oh winds, speed my friends to my aid! Hear my call!)

He was close... so close... She still had her eyes closed
in solemn acceptance, ready for the end...

And only heard a yelp of pain and the sound of sacred steel
tearing into Iron Bear&#39;s back.

(Thank you, Goddess.)

She opened her eyes, and was met with the image of
Xianghua, surrounded by a shining aura of pale blue, and
standing in her fighting stance just behind Iron Bear.

&quot;Dammit, why so RUDE?&quot;

He swung a huge arm behind him, only to have it pass
through the air as Xianghua ducked underneath it quickly,
then slicing upwards, the strength of the blade knocking
him clean through the air and onto the bed, and sending
blood flying.

The boss would have his head for having the sheets ruined,
as well as not being able to handle a mere woman. With a
twisted battle cry that was more of a roar- much akin to his
namesake, he attacked with sheer ferocity, leaping from the bed
and aiming to tackle her from the air.

It was unfortunate then, that he landed smack on the floor
crash and went downstairs the hard way, his heavy body
crushing itself with such a forceful impact.

All she had to do was turn to the right in a Bea Her Hua,
and he passed right by. It was a merciful way to
die. really... her sword showed no mercy, and even
less pity.

But the aura faded almost immediately as she half walked,
half ran to Talim&#39;s side, placing her hands on her cheeks
and looking her over to see if anything was wrong.

&quot;You&#39;re okay...&quot;

Talim tried to hide the blush that suddenly threatened to
rise to her face.

(Such soft hands...)

&quot;Y-yeah, I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m glad you could make it. Where is-&quot;

&quot;Mina&#39;s busy right now. I think it would be best if we
let her do her thing. But on a further note...&quot;

She pulled out the red box and opened it. Two pieces
of Soul Edge, glowing with a malevolent aura, were
sitting on velvet, as if they were some grand prize
of sorts.

(How vain these people are.)

&quot;Yeah, we&#39;ll just stay out of her way,&quot; Talim agreed. She
could feel some sort of force- a tangible heat in the air
that was laced with anger and vengance, with a touch of
sorrow- and there was love there as well.

(So odd... but so familiar. Yes, it&#39;s her.)

She smiled.

&quot;This place is going to come down around our ears... we&#39;d
better leave.&quot;

Xianghua did not question that suggestion one bit. Though
how Talim knew everything so intuitively was still
a matter to be asked, she saw the sense in asking later.

However, one thing was for certain in Xianghua&#39;s mind.

(I think I&#39;m starting to like you, Talim...)
____________________________________________________________

They were running now.

No matter... she would burn them all, eventually. Anyone
who got in her way was torn apart, or burned to death.
From the silence that the wind had taken, she assumed
that Talim was safe, and out of the area.

(Good work, Xian. I hope you have those shards as well,
because I don&#39;t know how to destroy them just yet.)

However, she had more important things to worry about
now. Things like finding the rest of those... pathetic,
worthless, lower-than-scum fools who thought they could
just do what they did and walk away... and making them beg
for death.

One however, was not even willing to beg.

The man named Wolf&#39;s Fang was on the roof of the biggest
warehouse in the dock, waiting. Tasting the air with his
nose, looking for her with his ears.

He had turned into something less than human, and the
madness in his eyes made them luminous and hard, like
gems.

One could almost swear that he could see in the dark.

But in any case, he smelled an otherworldy heat...
which would explain the screams of pain that echoed
through the docks, all without the clash of swords.
Men were being burned alive, and all without drawing
their weapons.

(A warrior who needs no weapon, eh? Kehehehehe!!
I&#39;ll kill her anyway! After all, she destroyed my
beautiful face... I will make her suffer!!)

She was closer now, he could see her. Just a little
further... Right under him. Perfect.

With an uncanny silence, he dropped towards her, claws
extended. As he fell upon her like a stone, a wicked
grin broke on his face. So easy!!

&quot;How foolish...&quot;

Too bad it was short lived. Mina stepped to her left and
leapt upwards, swinging her blade in a vertical circle.
As it cut a path through the air, flames trailed behind
it as the surrounding air was ignited. Fang realized that
he had sorely miscalculated, and was the unfortunate
victim of the Scarlet Thunder&#39;s fine edge, which
cut him clean in two, from head to navel. The heat
only made it easier and cleaner...

Mina landed, looked behind her as his two halves fell to
the floor and blood was everywhere, save for on her...
and then, she moved on, entering the building.

Two down.. one to go... and then, the leader.
____________________________________________________________

Tashiro heard nothing outside but screams and death.

He simply folded his legs and sat in meditation, waiting.
Clearing his mind. Preparing for this opportunity to rid
himself and his current lord of this nuisance.

He was a master of the wakizashi, and a former retainer
for a great and powerful lord. His tactics were
extraordinary- he had won his armies many a battle.

But even with his patrols highly trained, the shards were
probably already gone, and now this woman- a woman, of all
opponents!- had either torn them to shreds, burned them
alive, or both.

Or at least, his reports said.

Then, the room suddenly got very, very warm... The iron
doors were slowly turning red from the intense heat from
the outside, and without warning, the sound of combat steel
piercing the door echoed through the hall.

The red-hot blade of a kwandao was sticking halfway through
the door, and the blade began to pulse with energy. Slowly,
a hole was melted into the doors, and it grew with alarming
speed.

Once the hole was big enough to look through, Tashiro and
the leader of these pirates, named Takena, saw the fiercest,
most angry green eyes they had ever seen.

A woman with red hair, who seemed to have the very air around
her bend and twist with energy and sheer heat, walked through
the opening once it got big enough. Now, the wood was starting
to catch fire, and the various ornaments and trinkets had caught
such a high temperature, none dared touch them.

Takena, his voice full of appraisal and judgement, spoke.

&quot;Your friends are probably either escaped, or dead. Tell me why
you are still here, instead of helping them flee, or mourning
them.&quot;

Her eyes flashed menacingly, but her voice remained calm.

&quot;They aren&#39;t dead. I can still feel them inside. And I am
here to do just that... help them escape. You see, the less
of you that are alive, the better of a chance they have of
leaving for the inn in one piece, which is exactly where
I expect them to go.&quot;

He nodded approvingly. She would make a very good strategist,
had times been different. Oh, but the times would change.

&quot;Well planned. Perhaps you would do well in a world of
battle, where your skills can truly be used.&quot;

Mina quirked an eyebrow, waiting for a damn good reason
why to let them live.

&quot;Think of it. This world will soon have no need of us...
of such power as yours. If the world were in conflict
constantly, would it not be sheer bliss for one such
as yourself? With the Soul Edge, it is possible
to create such a world.&quot;

Mina scoffed at this. It was preposterous and pretentious.
A plan such as this could not be allowed to succeed, much
less even be carried out.

&quot;And of the people who cannot fight for themselves? What
of them?&quot;

Takena shrugged.

&quot;The weak must succumb to the strong. It&#39;s how things work
on the battlefield. To the winner go the spoils, and the
victor is allowed to change the history of the world as
he sees fit. Do you not want to define your own destiny?&quot;

&quot;Not at the cost of my soul.&quot;

Her mind assesed the situation, and quickly saw that the
man who called himself Tashiro had a short sword...
wakizashi, by the look of it. It was best that she change
weapons...

Her energy moved almost instantly, and the weapon responded.

The rod shortened so that it was more of a sword handle
than anything else. The blade turned from that of a kwandao
into that of a 40&quot; broadsword, the hilt in the form of the
usual dragon&#39;s head. The blade was 28&quot; long, and was
now looking very much like the White Storm and Blue
Thunder...

&quot;Tell you what... show me how strong you are.
You lose, you die. Win, and I just might consider this
world of eternal struggle.&quot;

Tashiro, who was mostly silent during this exchange, rose
from the floor and drew his weapon.

&quot;Accepted. I have waited for an opponent such as yourself.&quot;

Mina instinctively got into her ready stance, and entered
the battle with all intentions of winning.

Because if she lost, everything ended.

As the fires began to rage and the building began to show
signs of collapes, they charged each other headlong...

Whoa... intense.

That was probably one of my better fight scene chapters.
What do you all think? Questions? Comments? Requests for
next chapter? Please let me know.

- Next Chapter -

As the docks burn to only embers and ashes, a now ascended
Seung Mina goes to battle with a determined and ruthless
opponent. She will sacrifice her own beliefs, and even
her own friends, should she lose.

If anything, it shows confidence in her victory... but
will the end be as happy as the other ones? Or will
this be the beginning of a world of constant strife?
