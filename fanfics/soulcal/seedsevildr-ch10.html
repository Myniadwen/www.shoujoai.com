fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../soulcal/seedsevildr-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Case Subject:

One Seong Mi-na, age 23. Born Nov. 3, 1570 in Jirisan, Korea, 
during the tumultuous Joseon Dynasty. Jirisan was also known 
at the time as Seong Mountain, due to the fact that a training 
hall for various self-defense techniques and weapons arts run by
Seong Han-meyong, was located there.

Seeing as the mountain was named after the founder of
Seong Shi Dadao Shu, the style and techniques were of note at
the time.

Korean descent; family has a military background in the Korean 
Coast Guard. However, growing up without the support of her
mother, who died shortly after she herself was born, may have
been a blow to her character due to being largely without
a female influence. Grew up mostly alongside Hwang Seong-gyeong, 
then an orphan.

The two of them were nothing more than friends, and oftentimes
heated rivals in sparring, and lacked a desire to take the 
relationship further.

This was a strain on Han-myeong, who wanted a son more than
anything else, due to the fact that his own had died from the
same illness that his wife had contracted. Thus, Mi-na was
left as the sole heir to the long blade style, which had now
reached legendary status.

At the time, such notions were unacceptable, and he considered
marrying her off, time and time again. He made an attempt
twice to arrange a marriage with Hwang; both times failed,
largely due to the fact that Mi-na considered herself
more than a prize or treasure to be handed out for any 
personal ends.

During the year 1586, rumors of Japan&#39;s invasion plans against
Ming China, with Korea as a foothold, had reached the country.
Now age sixteen, and proficient at multiple weapons with a
mastery of the zhanmadao, Mi-na had grown fond of her 
motherland, and thus fiercely protective.

However, after being rejected by the Coast Guard, a desperate
plan formed in her mind. To find the Soul Edge and obtain it
for the glory of her country. After running away from her home
and entering Ming China with the aim of collecting information,
She ran into the kunoichi known as Taki, and was informed of
the blade&#39;s inherent evil.

Unbelieving of her words, she struck blindly and was defeated
utterly by an opponent who was far faster and more experienced.
After recovering from her injuries however, the words seemed
to stick with her...

She began searching for rumors and tales of the blade, asking
for anything she could find. Eventually, she pieced the story
together, yet did not believe entirely, since there were so many
conflicting pieces of information. Most of them, however, spoke
of it as an abomination.

She headed off on a journey in order to utterly destroy the
cursed weapon, firm in her belief that such a blade should not
be placed in her motherland. Along the way, near the Silk Road
trade route that ran through Turkey, she ran into her old
rival, Hwang.

Surprised that she had run away, he scolded her for being so
far away from home, and without her father&#39;s permission. Already
a hardened and seasoned warrior, he was prepared to thwart Mi-na&#39;s
advance, even going so far to claim that if she could properly 
disarm him, he would allow her to travel with him in search of 
the Soul Edge.

He did not expect her to succeed...

Though the battle was long and arduous, she finally managed to
disarm the superior fighter, perhaps due to the fact that she
was determined not to lose so badly as she had to the ninja.
Eventually, she persuaded him to allow her to join, all the while
informing him of the information she had gathered.

Only her coaxing to continue their quest for the destruction of
the Soul Edge prevented him from rushing back to Jirisan 
immediately with her in tow. With that, they continued along the
Silk Road, pushing their way through one battle after another.

Eventually, they had arrived in Venice, Italy, the closest
they would ever get to the epicenter of the chaos unaided. It
was here that the coalition between the five individuals who
would tempt fate took place, the last one arriving a bit
later than the rest.

Mi-na had run into Taki once again, and after exchanging a few
terse words, they fought. The battle had lasted for quite a
while longer this time as Mi-na put up a much more focused and 
agressive resistance. In the end however, the battle was at a 
stalemate, due to the fact that it had been broken up by both 
Hwang and one Sophitia Alexandra, whom had persuaded Taki to 
join her in the quest for Soul Edge&#39;s destruction.

As the four of them traveled together, Mi-na saw signs that the
two of them had more... intimate contact than at first glance.
Curious as to how this could be, she began following them
around, taking in their movements and observations. She noticed
that she herself was starting to become used to the idea of
two women in that situation.

Why not? A woman was the only one who truly understood another
woman. It was simple logic, as far as she could discern.

In any event, the last member of this group, Heishero Mitsurugi,
was discovered when the five of them made a raid on the treasure
hoard of an arms dealer named Vercci, hearing rumors that various
weapons and artifacts were stored there. The possibility of
Soul Edge being there was quite high.

However, what they found there was far more terrifying... Voldo,
blind, deaf, and insane from the years in the darkness, was
the guardian of the Money Pit, as it had been called. Completely
thwarted by his odd movements and the fact that he could
fight even with his back turned, Mi-na suffered grave injuries
during the battle, and the other three companions were held
effectively at bay.

Only with the sudden intervention of the Japanese mercenary did
they succeed... however, they were turned upon in an instant
as they explained why they had come. Taki and Mitsurugi engaged
in a fierce melee while Sophita and Hwang tended to the ailing
Mi-na, who could do nothing but watch the battle.

In the end, as the two of them exhausted their resources and
fought to a draw, the rouge samurai reluctantly agreed to join
their party, commenting on their skills... or lack of, in his
opinion, save for the kunoichi. Believing that they would need
his support and convinced that they would lead him to what
he sought, he was the only one in the group with an ulterior
motive.

Thus, as they headed towards the final conflict, the tales
of sheer devastation and desecration became more evident over
time. Now confirmed as a twisted blade, the five of them were
now determined to end the madness, once and for all. During
their entrance into Spain, they took note of a man who seemed
as if he were from Ming China. Seeing the grave wounds on
his person, Mi-na trembled in fear for the first time...

If it were this bad now... what would it be like when she
actually fought him?

With this in mind, she charged forward into the port where
the pirate ship, Adrian, was located. The oppresive wave of
force that met her was almost too much as she looked at a man
who was no longer human...

Now shaken to her core with dread, she rushed forward in
sheer instinct, fueled by the desperation to wash away the
being that caused this primal fear. The battle was fierce and
tumultuous, but she had eventually recieved far too many
blows from the twin swords, and was on the brink of defeat
and death as the others entered.

Hwang was the first to charge as he saw his one and only
friend lying there on the floor, about to have her efforts end
in vain. Mitsurugi joined the fray as well, his sword flashing
and a wild grin on his face. Only Sophitia and Taki hung back,
tending to a critically-injured Mi-na with whatever methods they
could administer.

The pirate&#39;s blades fed on their anger, pain, sadness, and
fervor for battle, and thus grew ten-fold in strength. It seemed
to increase in puissance and lethality with every swing through
the air, until their weapons trembled under the shock of guarding
against such a beastly set of weapons.

Mi-na was healed quickly, her wounds not having much time to
heal... and yet they were healing rapidly as the kunoichi&#39;s
magic and the oracle&#39;s prayers rained on the Seong prodigy.
However, all strength had left her. The bleeding had stopped;
there were no scars; but the fatigue had already seeped to her
very bones.

It was then that she realized what had happened to her.

She had been sapped of most of her very essence; her life force.

Her soul.

Just being *near* the blades was draining them all of their 
strength! Barely able to stand without the support of her weapon, 
she watched in dismay as her suspicions were confirmed. Hwang
and Mitsurugi were sent sprawling to the floor by a wide, 
sweeping circle from the Soul Edge. All seemed lost...

But as he glowered in victory, standing over the two of them as
if deciding whose soul to devour first, Sophitia stepped forward,
challenging the demonized pirate openly. With a sick grin and
a raise of his weapons, he charged forth.

However, her divine armor and weapons somehow protected her,
their aura shining out against the waves of desecration.
Becoming increasingly frustrated that the woman was still moving,
even after all of his best attempts, his focused effort turned
into one of rage as he allowed himself to sink into a berserked
state.

The weapons and armor were scarred terribly, and Sophitia lost
her protective aura... but as her strength faded with every swing,
she found an opening. Blocking the long sword with her shield, which
almost buckled and broke completely under the might of the increased 
spiritual force delivered from Soul Edge, she let out a sharp,
piercing cry...

And shattered one of the blades.

The twisted harmony between the two weapons had been destroyed,
and the pirate, who had allowed its influence to completely
enfold him, was almost torn in two by the loss. His mind was warped
and twisted as the energy flowed back into him in a quite bad way,
and he staggered backwards, his head reeling in pain.

However, Sophitia could do nothing about it...

She was in quite a bad state herself, the pieces of the weapon
imbedded within several critical areas of her body upon the 
destruction of the short sword. In the end, it was up to Taki, the
last fighter standing, to deliver the finishing blow to the
dread pirate.

But even with the loss of one sword, he was still formidable.
Even the hardened, veteran demon huntress was hard-pressed to
contain the threat, let alone neutralize it. However, he made
mistakes; errors in judgement. Giving himself to the blade had taken
its toll on him, and the destruction of one of the swords had almost
literally made him half the man he used to be.

With that, she completely defeated the evil pirate, knocking the
sword away from his grasp and forcing him to the ground in an
unconcious state. With Mi-na and herself the only two left fully
conscious, they staggered away from the battlefield, before he could
recover, carrying their wounded with them as best they could...

After undergoing her rigorous training from her father as punishment,
it would be a mere two months after her after her return before
she left once again, tired of being hassled and harassed by the 
wealthy son of the Kim family.

The next three years would change her entire life, as she was
introduced to the world of Ling-Sheng Su rod arts. However, her
teacher, named Kong Xiuqiang, professed that he was not officially
ordained to teach her the full style, yet congratulated her on
the fact that she knew enough to survive on her own, and within
the short space of one year.

Learning never to underestimate her opponent&#39;s strength or
capability at first glance, she began her own training regimen,
immersing herself in the rod arts and her father&#39;s style for two
more years, growing to a point where she had become a seasoned
fighter, and won most of the conflicts she had gotten herself into.

It was also during this time that she made random trips around
the world during her training, and picked up several dialects of 
Mandarin and a firm command of Japanese. By the time she had
heard of rumors of the Soul Edge&#39;s resurgance, she was a woman
of the world at age nineteen, who had seen her share of battles 
and conflicts by now.

Running into Chai Xianghua was what she would call a lucky 
accident... but what others would call fate.

Along with Kilik, Maxi, Sophitia, Taki, Mitsurugi, and Hwang,
who was furious with Mi-na for leaving without permission again,
They all sought to utterly vanquish the blade, once and for all.
Along the way, they had run into quite a few new faces... including
the evil stench of the Lizard Men, an army of beasts which were
once human, twisted by arcane means. Time and time again, they
met with what seemed to be droves of scouting parties, and
soon knew that they too were looking for Soul Edge.

Leading them was a hulking beast known as Astaroth, vile in
temperament and immense in size. He drove the creatures onward
in a plague that served more to aid the cursed blade than their
own causes, which were at the time unknown. They had to fight
this massive army over and over during their travels, ever hounded
by an organization which they never could identify.

However, not all of the meetings were bad.

Finding that they were lacking the strength for their venture, the
party headed towards the Himalayan moutain range, a massive natural
defense between India and Ming Dynasty China. Led to this place
by Kilik, they met a man known as Edge Master. He did not yet reveal
himself as the former head of the Ling-Sheng Su temple, and as such,
Kilik did not tell anyone.

However, when she saw him hold his battered staff in his hands, she
knew. It was the same stance as hers... with a grin, she challenged
him on the spot. She wanted to test her strength and resolve. However,
she was beaten quite handily... but because of it, she would undergo
such rigorous training over the next few months that her skills were 
augmented to the point where she could match blades soundly with the 
ancient master.

When they had finally fought to a draw one day after the months of
near-torture she had endured, he declared her fit to continue her
path, wherever it may lead. Due to her potential, he even considered
making her a monk of the Ling-Sheng Su... though she politely declined.
If there was one thing she had learned over the years from all her 
training, it was tact and courtesy, not to mention respect for her 
opponent.

It was also during those months in the mountains... that she learned
about love. Xianghua admitted openly to the woman that was three years 
her senior, that she had feelings for her. Admiration and respect,
the girl of sixteen had expected. Love however, the young Imperial 
Guard had not forseen in the least.

However, the tranquility was not to last for long- they had a job to
do. And eventually, they found their quarry...

He was known as Nightmare, and his blade, though one of a much
different make and size, was another Soul Edge. Or was it the same 
one, but with a different wielder? Did it change according to who
wielded it? Whatever the case was, she could somehow tell it was the 
genuine article. Furious that the last effort had been in vain, she
lashed out with authority, once again the first person to charge forth.

This time, however... the ensuing battle shook the grounds upon which 
it was held as a now more experienced Seong Mi-na clashed her blade
against that of the azure knight&#39;s. It was still the dreaded spirit
sword, just as powerful and just as malevolent- but this time, she
seemed as if she stood a chance.

However, she had overstepped her limits, forgetting entirely of
the sword&#39;s powers- her strength was being sapped, even as she swung
her weapon. Frustrated and irritated at her lack of defenses against
it, Mi-na threw all of her weight behind one single, desperate attack,
hoping to put at least a crack in his armor.

Nothing. She missed entirely, and got hit with a massive wave of
force. She hadn&#39;t been cut in any way, and yet coughed up blood. She
was spent, and something had been broken instead of skin being 
pierced. Looking at her opponent through her blurred vision, Mi-na
considered herself just about finished... And then, the others came,
jumping in when it seemed as if the battle had died down.

The fight was furious and highly destructive as the castle walls
were wracked with the sounds of the conflict outside and the war
within, until they were all drawn into the blade&#39;s center. Somehow,
Xianghua and Kilik had beaten him off to the point where they had him
cornered. She noticed then that the young monk had something slung
across his shoulder- a sash with mirrors instead of cloth.

It shone and pulsed as he fought against the monster... and she
knew at once from seeing it that it was of great importance. It kept
him sane- not only that, but it kept his strength from being sapped.
The mirror was a divine artifact of some sort... the fog in her mind
lifted enough for her to remind herself to ask the hermit about it
later.

Then, all was black...

She awoke about an hour later in a cloud of swirling lights. A void;
full of life and energy and possibilities, and at the same time 
chaos and dismay. She was *inside* of Soul Edge...

She wanted to scream. The terror, the primal fear that had come over
her the last time she had fought the weapon had returned, only now
it was doubled in force. Tripled. Number upon number of screams filled
her head- the death cries of the victims of the twisted steel.

She didn&#39;t want to go through with it... not any more. She just wanted
to go home...

Then, another voice pierced through the screams. Something else was 
here. An order among the chaos- the very antithesis of all the evil 
around her. It shouted a call to arms; all at once, it was both calming
and full of exuberance- of fervor. It were as if the call was coming
from her own soul instead of an outside source.

This voice had a name... Soul Calibur.

When her vision cleared of the haze around her, she noticed that
Kilik was busy trying to defend himself against the evil, rather than
strike out against it. There seemed little he could do about it but
defend... Mitsurugi and Hwang were circling, waiting for an opening.
Taki and Sophitia were standing near Mi-na, looking upon the sight
before them in awe as Xianghua reached up for the very thing that had 
called Mi-na to alertness.

It was a sword... pale blue and magnificent- the most beautiful thing
that their eyes had ever seen. Yet she knew it for what it was. It
was a weapon, not a work of art, and it seemed just as alive as the
Soul Edge. But this life was clean; untainted by any mortal hand.
Only someone *worthy* could wield this weapon, she realized.

And yet... she did not know that the weapon known as Soul Calibur had
done something to her own Scarlet Thunder- it had undergone a 
transformation from within. There were legends behind every Seong
heirloom, and the Scarlet Thunder was no exception. It had simply
been waiting for an opportune moment in which it would be of use.

This was the moment. She did not know how or why it had happened, nor
did she question it. She simply knew what she needed to do, without 
hesitation.

As her blade ignited in spiritual flame and searing heat without her
knowledge, she leapt forward... and cut towards the malignant flames,
her own passing through them as if to neutralize them. In fact,
that&#39;s exactly what happened. The two powers cancelled each other out,
and his defensive aura dissapated.

The creature stumbled in surprise and pain... then attacked the 
newcomer, only to be pressed back by Xianghua&#39;s renewed strength. 
Not just renewed, but increased thousand-fold, as if she had been 
reborn. The beast could not properly defend against both sets of 
attacks, and the others simply watched in awe as the two of them landed 
signifigant, telling blows to their mutual adversary.

With the demon sufficiently tamed and downed, Xianghua dealt the
finishing blow to the opponent... but as silence fell and they were
transported back to the now obliterated castle, not all was well.
The devastation before them told the tale that thier battle in the
void had effected the outside world quite harshly.

On top of that, the mirror had been completely obliterated by the
sheer wave of force that had been exerted when their foe had been
vanquished, now in shards of emerald. Kilik sat on his knees, looking
hopelessly at his now destroyed defense against the evils from
without and within.

Seeing the destruction and the sheer hopelessness of it all, Mi-na
sank to her knees and wept. The sword -that beautiful, pale blue
instrument of justice and potent healing- was gone. The screams came
back to her mind in force and en masse.

The only thing she screamed out was to make it all stop. To kill her.

It was the reason why she had once again gone into the mountains...
why she had learned how to control her energies and to sense that of 
others... why she had become a full-fledged Ling-Sheng Su practitioner 
without even becoming a monk or swearing one oath. And now, after she 
had turned age 23 and was beginning to see the infinite possibilities
before her, she had left home once again.

This time, at the permission of her father and with her her own 
newfound sense of responsibility nagging at her every step of the
way, she presses onward to warn the young pupil named Yun-seong
of the danger into which he seems so ready to plunge head-first
into.

Chapter 10- Shadow War (Part 3)
________________________________________________________________________

It was the morning after they had been introduced, and Mi-na was
meditating, her legs folded in lotus position as she breathed. The
world around her seemed to simply fade as she considered the steps
she had to take in order to help Taki out. She was already plenty
sneaky- that much was evident enough. She could move fast as well-
a good trait of a ninja, as far as she could tell.

But what else?

She needed something else, didn&#39;t she? A specialty of some sort?
Her mind searched for the awnser, but after a while, let the thought
drift off. She figured that she would simply take things one step at
a-

(Hmm? What&#39;s that?)

Something behind her. It sounded like someone approaching- they were
trying to be quiet. But the slight sounds of the grass and leaves gave
the otherwise silent steps away- whoever this was, they were probably
within two feet of her, maybe less. To get this close without her
observation was the mark of someone experienced.

She opened her eyes slowly, not daring to make it seem as if she
knew someone was there. Her breathing was still steady and her body
seemed as if it had been stopped in time. Her training had taken her
to the point where she could control herself in a much greater extent
than most.

As soon as the person was close enough to smell on the wind, she leaned
her upper body back and grinned up at whoever it was. It was a man- a 
young man, probably about sixteen or seventeen. His stealth was indeed 
impressive- he was closer than she had at first imagined. She had almost 
bumped into his knees.

&quot;Gotcha!&quot; She managed to make him jump back a few inches in surprise.
&quot;You knew I was coming? When?&quot; He asked, more curious than irritated.
Good, she liked the fact that he could admit defeat. &quot;I&#39;m guessing you
were about an arm&#39;s length, maybe two away before I could catch wind
of you. Not bad!&quot;

She sprung to her feet, dusted herself off, and turned to face him.
&quot;I&#39;m Mi-na, by the way.&quot; The young ninja, who wore mostly green and 
white with a bit of gold trim on his body armor, bowed respectfully. 
&quot;Most everyone knows that now; your names, I mean. I&#39;m Shinjiro.&quot;

Mi-na bowed back and smiled warmly. &quot;Cool. Anyways, did you want
something from me?&quot; Shinjiro placed his hand on his chin for a brief
moment, as if considering what to say, then he nodded. &quot;Yes, I did.
I was wondering if you would spar with me for a moment- I wouldn&#39;t
know what you needed to learn without some kind of examination of what
you already know.&quot;

Mi-na quirked an eyebrow and smirked. &quot;You&#39;re sure about this? It&#39;s
been said that I&#39;m pretty good, y&#39;know.&quot; He nodded, and she 
immediately threw a jab at him before his head was back up again!
In effect, as soon as his face was looking at her again, he had to
lean back in order to clear her fist, his eyes widening in shock.

(Damn, she&#39;s fast,) he thought as he immediately went on the defensive,
hopping a few good feet back. The only problem with that was, she was
already upon him within a few shuffle steps, lunging towards him with
a fierce straight to his gut. Her fist instantly retreated after the
blow, almost leaving an after-image in its wake. She stepped forward
again as he was sent reeling and slammed her right palm into his
face, right between his eyes. With a dull thud, Shinjiro was sent 
further back, the sheer force of the attack almost making him fall 
to the ground.

(*Too* fast! I have to do something about this before I&#39;m down!)
It was then that he heard it- something heavy rising upwards through
the air. He saw it too- as his vision cleared, he caught a good front
row seat of a front stretch kick, the instep of Mi-na&#39;s right foot
heading towards his very vulnerable face.

Or so she thought.

&quot;I&#39;ve got you now,&quot; he said triumphantly as he grabbed her ankle with
both hands, effectively stopping the kick. Unfortunately, he was
suddenly flung upwards as Mi-na&#39;s left instep rammed into him, sending
her sailing backwards with both legs extended and a wide grin on her
face as she landed, returning to her ready stance. A flip kick.

(She kicked at me like that... knowing that I&#39;d see it... not bad...)
Shinjiro managed to clear his head enough to right himself, landing
on the ground on the balls of his feet, much like a cat does after
falling from a tree. &quot;Nice one,&quot; he said as he charged forward,
sacrificing all defensive efforts for an offensive attack. It was a
good plan, at least to him.

Mi-na had to agree. &quot;*Now* we&#39;re talkin&#39;! Come on!&quot; With an equal
speed, she rushed forward at the same instant, determined to meet
her opponent head on. Not surprisingly, the two of them decided to
throw the same attack, though Shinjiro didn&#39;t expect her to move
so quickly. He wondered briefly how long she had trained for before
the two fists met halfway, a resounding crack ringing through the
forest in which they sparred. 

However, Mi-na had learned how to control her internal energies, 
and thus use them against an opponent. The shockwave of force that 
followed the attack from his opponent was more of a surprise than 
anything else to Shinjiro, and as the two of them flew backwards
only a few feet away from their meeting place, he had to reconsider
his game plan.

But he didn&#39;t have long- she was coming at him yet again! &quot;Nuts
to this- let&#39;s go,&quot; he said, forgoing any sort of game plan what
so ever and quickly getting into a ready stance, his hands in
defensive open palms. And a good thing, too- he reacted against
the next attack from her, a punch to mid-chest, much faster.

As her left punch snapped forward, his right hand did so as
well, negating the attack. He almost instantly sent a right
reverse knife hand towards Mi-na&#39;s neck, which she ducked clean
under. However, she did feel something else pass over her-
a rush of air. She felt a few strands of hair being cut off
as well.

(What the... he&#39;s using the wind as a weapon, just like Talim!
And me without my Scarlet Thunder... dammit!) Realising the 
situation she was in, she quickly rolled to the side as another 
knife hand swipe came downwards towards her left shoulder, almost
taking her arm clean off. She quickly stood, turned towards
the young man again, and found that he was gone.

(Where did he... awww, man... now he wants to play hide and seek.)
She figured that he was either out of sight, or moving too fast for
her eyes to track. So she didn&#39;t use her eyes at all- she had other
senses that she could use, including the ability to tap into the
spiritual energies of all things and anticipate the intent of an
attack, wherever it might come from.

With that, she closed her eyes and listened.

The wind seemed to be everywhere... and yet, she could hear him.
She knew what the guy looked like already- it wasn&#39;t that hard
to get a picture of him in her mind and how he was going to attack.
But she couldn&#39;t block- his arms and legs were more swords than
anything now, and she couldn&#39;t block a blade with her forearms or
shins.

So she&#39;d have to move... quickly.

Only a moment after she had thought such a thing, he approached.
He was trying to flank her, from her right side. She did nothing
to smirk or grin as he approached- play time was over, now that
he was serious. She immediately dropped into a low tiger stance,
her left leg bending at the knee and her right leg extended.
One of her fists were raised above her head, while the other was
level with her waist, hanging above her right knee.

Thus... &quot;What?&quot; His attack missed, the blade of air cutting
harmlessly where she used to be. With that, she quickly lunged
forward, ramming her right palm into her opponent&#39;s ribs, adding 
a twist and an exhalation to the attack.

Boom. He was sent flying as the energy that Mi-na had stored
during the evasion was used against him. She didn&#39;t dare open her
eyes as she returned to a fighting stance, waiting for his next
move. (I gotta keep this up. I have to put him down so that he
can&#39;t attack again... but without stopping him from moving,
meaning killing him entirely. This is harder than I thought 
it&#39;d be.)

On the other hand, Shinjiro was breathing hard as he stood again,
his body complaining from the hits that he was forced to take.
(Well, that didn&#39;t work... she can hear me coming, no matter how
fast I moved- and if I moved any faster, I&#39;ll just about kill 
myself with the strain on my body. She&#39;s that good, I&#39;ll grant
her that. But even so...)

He sprung to his feet and rushed toward Mi-na, seeming to 
vanish on the spot and re-appear right in front of her in order
to deliver a front kick, the ball of his foot aiming towards the
shin of her forward leg to slam into the tibia. She retreated
quickly, taking a few shuffle steps backwards before launching
forward with a side kick. Thing was, her eyes were closed,
so she wouldn&#39;t have a counter like last time.

She stumbled a bit as she felt nothing but air- he had
dodged the incoming attack. Before she could retreat, he rammed
his left shoulder into her solar plexus, knocking the wind out
of her and sending her toward the ground. Without wasting time,
he spiraled upwards with a leap, using the air below him as
a support... before coming straight down onto Mi-na with his
left leg extended in a falling side kick.

She heard it. A fraction of a second later, she saw it, her eyes 
snapping open as she realized what he was going to do. She could
feel the air pressure coming down on her- he was going to pierce
her with the attack! She had to move, and right now, before...

But her body wouldn&#39;t respond. Her breathing was too shallow,
and that hit to her stomach hurt like nothing else. (Come on,
*move*!) With an outcry of pain, she rolled to her right side,
allowing the kick to slam into the ground. She was pretty much
right about what would happen as an impact crater five inches deep
and six inches wide was made upon impact... and he didn&#39;t even
hit the ground with his foot.

The resulting miss of an attack sent the ninja into the air again,
albeit safely. Landing just a few feet away from Mi-na, he grinned
wildly. (Just as I expected- I&#39;d have to use everything I had on 
her. That last attack I hit her with wasn&#39;t anything special, but
it certainly did a number on her... still, I think that&#39;s enough.)

Mi-na stood slowly, finally regaining her breath. She smiled weakly,
knowing that she would have to push herself to the limits which she
had trained herself in order to keep the young man down. But as
soon as she assumed her stance again, he raised his hand.

&quot;You told me all I needed to know on that last dodge. You&#39;re
good. Really good. Determined, too. But the fact is, you need to 
know a bit more about tactics- you&#39;re relying too much on luck and 
sheer force.&quot; Mi-na pouted at this and dropped her stance. She
wanted to come at him with something biting; derisive.

But she knew why it hurt... it was because he was right.

&quot;Okay then.. what do I need to learn?&quot; The young man smiled and
nodded, glad that she was taking everything so well. With the
pout and things of that sort, he was expecting her to attack.
&quot;What I&#39;m going to teach you is the art of Buryaku- military
tactics. Actions that you can do on the fly, almost to a point
where you don&#39;t have to think about it.&quot;

Mi-na&#39;s expression brightened a bit. &quot;Interesting... tell me more.&quot;

Taki sat in the council room from now on, listening in on most of the
meetings and offering input where needed. Of course, she wasn&#39;t an
official member, but none of the ninja who had been on the council
were in any position to lead. They simply discussed and decided on 
matters, told the others about it, and it all seemed to work.

Today&#39;s meeting was a rather important one- Kageboushi&#39;s scouting
party had returned with information. Indeed, the body of their former
clan leader, Toki, was found rotting in the underground Hoko Temple.
It was swarmed with demons and vengeful spirits, hoping to use the
battered and torn corpse for their own ends, but after disposing of
the body and dispelling the sprits, the threat was effectively
neutralized.

The only question now was this: how would they go about dealing with 
the other faction, now that Toki was dead? They were effectively
a headless body, without a successor named before the man&#39;s death. 
Surely, they could look for Hachibei, who was the rightful leader in 
the first place?

But Taki squashed that notion. &quot;He wouldn&#39;t want to be involved if
the Mekki-Maru were still around and the shards were still active.
We need to take care of things here first until further actions are
taken to choose a new leader. Besides, I&#39;ve lost his location- he&#39;s
probably hidden himself so well that not even my network can find him.&quot;

Ookamikingin considered this for a moment, then nodded. &quot;Then explain
to us what you would do in this situation.&quot; Taki quirked an eyebrow.
&quot;All I did was kill Toki for you- why should I be involved in 
rebuilding the clan when you all are here to do so?&quot; Kishiumi looked
at Taki with an intense gaze. The rest seemed to follow suit, only
waiting for her awnser.

&quot;If a successor were named... you would be the one,&quot; she said. 
&quot;Toki and Hachibei both considered you like a daughter. Therefore, 
you carry more weight than you realize around here, even with them 
gone. We ask your opinion because you are the most skilled of all of 
us- and surely the most prized. So then, what would you do?&quot;

Taki almost blushed from all of the attention she was recieving.
But she would not show her flustered inner state to them- not when
she was expected to say something. So then, she considered. What
would they want more than anything, were Toki gone? To carry out
his will? Perhaps to honor his death? But that would mean that
they would want to fight, which would not be too good for the clan
in general. They wouldn&#39;t be a clan if they were mostly dead.

&quot;They will want to fight- to avenge their master. We might not be
able to avoid this, but we have to try. Soul Edge may have thwarted
us long before we even start this plan, mind you... each of those
in Toki&#39;s faction has a shard. Who knows what it could be doing to
their minds?&quot;

They all thought about it and nodded. This much was true enough.
She continued. &quot;What else would they want though? What would they
care to have more than the very thing which they were sent for?
We may not be able to find out, but we can at least make a guess.
They would want soemone to lead them, first and foremost. Their 
leader is currently dead, after all.&quot;

One of the men who hadn&#39;t introduced himself quite yet spoke.
&quot;Perhaps they will try and contact Hachibei. We must do something
to secure him before they do.&quot; Taki did not consider it. She sighed,
dreading to have to involve her more prominent father figure in
this conflict, but saw no better option. &quot;You do know of his 
daughter, Chie... don&#39;t you?&quot;

The man nodded. &quot;Keep her safe. If anything, these ninja will be
predisposed to violent means, now that they have possession of
Soul Edge fragments. I want them captured if they try to resist-
I brought a few people with me who can neutralize the evil 
influences within their minds, if there are any.&quot;

The man stood and bowed. &quot;Immediately, then. I&#39;ll set up a team 
right away.&quot; He just about vanished, which didn&#39;t surprise Taki in 
the least. Nothing did anymore. Kishiumi smiled and nodded. &quot;You
see? You&#39;re doing better than you thought you would, are you not?&quot;
Taki managed to smile, just a bit.

&quot;Yes... yes, I am.&quot;

With that, the meeting continued.
________________________________________________________________________

It had been three days.

Shinjiro was calmly sitting down, his legs folded in tailor fashion.
He was meditating, contemplating something of which he would not
reveal. Suddenly, he heard something out of the blue- a twig snapping.
He did not take it to mean anything, so continued focusing on clearing
his mind. He did not bother with looking out for attacks and seemed
completely vulnerable.

He wasn&#39;t.

But there was no attack for quite a while, so he went undisturbed.
He heard something passing in front of him- by the noise of the wind
it was a rock- a small but weighty stone which was thrown at the
left side of his head. He caught it, crushed the rock with little
thought, and repositioned himself. Almost immediately after, another
rock came from the right side. He caught this one as well, but didn&#39;t
expect another one to come from the front right. The attacker
was trying to distract him, and was doing a good job.

The rock whacked him upside the head- his headband defended him
somewhat, but he didn&#39;t entirely care at the moment. He was forced to 
open his eyes and rise to his feet, getting irritated at whoever this 
was. He looked around him, wondering who was doing the rock-tossing.
A throw from his right, at his side! Caught-

He felt a tap on his left shoulder from behind, just as he caught the
stone. Turning his head, he saw a grinning Seong Mi-na. &quot;Flanked from 
the left rear. You&#39;re dead.&quot; Shinjiro grinned. &quot;Nice work. I didn&#39;t
even hear you coming. To think that it only took you three days to
get it down.&quot; Mi-na couldn&#39;t help but giggle at this. &quot;Hey, it&#39;s always
been said that I&#39;m a quick study.&quot;

He nodded and turned towards Mi-na. &quot;I&#39;d have you do an ambush, but
it&#39;s just one of you... then again, if you think you could do it, give
it a shot. I&#39;ll give you a few minutes to hide if you want.&quot; Mi-na
shook her head and smiled. &quot;Hey, not so fast. I want to try and do
it in the middle of a fight.&quot;

He quirked an eyebrow. &quot;You sure? You have to be damn fast in order
to do that sucessfully.&quot; Mi-na smiled sweetly and moved to her left,
her body seeming to disappear as she did so. Suddenly appearing on
his right side, she spoke to him as he jumped in surprise. &quot;This
good enough?&quot; He looked... she was gone. A voice to his right side;
&quot;Or this?&quot; He looked- she was nowhere to be found. She had moved
again before he could catch sight of her. Completely disoriented,
he could not tell where she had gone until the last moment...

He felt a tap from behind his left shoulder. Turned, nothing there...
turned to face his front again, and he had to lean back in surprise
as he saw a fist two inches in front of his face. Mi-na laughed
mockingly. &quot;Relax; I didn&#39;t even throw the punch- I just left my arm
hanging there! But have I proven myself now?&quot;

(Amazing,) he mused to himself. (She got it down pat, and didn&#39;t even
use her ki... is she just that fast?) She stood there, waiting. &quot;Well?
Have I proven myself?&quot; Shinjiro shook his head to clear himself from
the daze he was in and nodded. &quot;Erm, one question... did you use any
spiritual energy during that whole thing?&quot;

Mi-na scoffed. &quot;That&#39;d be cheating. I wouldn&#39;t cheat on one of my own
teammates, you know. You&#39;re the one who taught me how to be this fast;
at least give yourself some credit for it.&quot; He shook his head and 
smiled. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about that- I do give myself some credit. But 
I give you the rest of it- that&#39;s outstanding work, Mi-na.&quot;

She bowed, her eyes cast to the ground. &quot;Thank you for everything.&quot;

He smiled and ruffled her hair. &quot;No worries.&quot; Mi-na frowned a bit as
he did so. &quot;Stop that- you&#39;re making me feel like some little kid.&quot; He
couldn&#39;t help but laugh as he apologized.

To Be Continued...

Well then, that&#39;s one for you. As you may have guessed by now, there
are three more to go: Talim&#39;s training, Xianghua&#39;s, and Kilik&#39;s. I
think that was a rather nice one, don&#39;t you? In any event, let&#39;s
hear the ins and outs of this one. Tell me what you think and I&#39;ll
change the next chapter based on your comments. That&#39;s how this
criticism thing usually works, after all.

Stay safe, guys. I&#39;m outtie.</pre>
