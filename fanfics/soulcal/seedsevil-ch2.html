<a href="../soulcal/seedsevil-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Four years ago...

A nineteen year old Mina was excited for some strange reason. It was not 
her first time in the midst of the teeming masses of Ming Dynasty China. 
However, the young woman beside her, three years younger, had come to 
this majestic summer palace to introduce the young warrior to her 
superior... the emperor himself.

Though she was enthralled by his very presence, she was nervous as all 
hell, no matter how much the emperor himself told her to relax. She 
explained that the only way to relax, at least for her, was to perfect 
her art. And so, on the center stage of that garden lake, she was asked 
to demonstrate.

No one expected for her to do so well in the sight of the emperor, as 
well as her new friend. Even the most seasoned of veterans in the 
Personal Guard, which she was traveling with, broke out in applause. 
Blushing, she muttered sheepishly that she was not fully trained yet.

The emperor begged to differ, going so far as to ask her to join his own 
Personal Guards. She was in shock, but her friend suggested it. It would 
be convienient, and aid in her training. But Mina refused. Until she was 
ready for such a task, she would not join this elite. However, she would 
keep it in the back of her mind, for the time being.

It was then that the sixteen year old woman began to have her feelings 
shift toward the fiery Seung Mina...

Chapter 2: The New Age
________________________________________________________________________

Seung Mountain. A lone woman walks down the stone steps in a state of 
thought. &#39;That presence... I can&#39;t shake it. What was it? Could it be a 
side effect of this &quot;Evil Seed&quot; that people are going crazy from?&#39; Then, 
with horror, &#39;So that means that MY weapon is possesed by a demon! 
Wait... it didn&#39;t seem that way. That... thing or whatever helped me out 
at the school. But why? And it said something... I think it said &#39;It 
begins.&#39; What begins?&#39; At this point, Mina&#39;s head began to pound. 
&quot;Whatever. Just think about it later.&quot;

As she completes her walk down the mountain, Mina was already feeling 
better. She had escaped, and was once again on the road. But, of course, 
the effort involved drained her energy; she was hungry, and tired. &quot;I 
think I&#39;ll stop by Beni&#39;s for a snack.&quot;
________________________________________________________________________

The local bar was not only the home of the best food and drinks in town, 
but also doubled as an inn. However, what it was really notorious for 
was the frequent stops of mercenaries and adventurers, mostly seeking 
information. And who better to pass out information than an informant: 
Benten &quot;The Banshee&quot; Shirou, a former warrior, and an active part of 
Heishero Mitsurugi&#39;s information network. And this day was no different. 
For the thousandth time that day, the door had opened. &quot;Sit down,&quot; he 
said with an almost indifferent tone, &quot;and I&#39;ll be right with ya.&quot; 
&quot;Really now, is that any way to treat your customers, much less your 
friends?&quot; with a surprised, and shocked look on his face, he turns 
toward the door to see... &quot;Seung Mina! I heard that you were locked in 
the school-&quot; &quot;News still travels fast around here, I see.&quot; Beni finally 
calmed down and, with a smile, said &quot;Hmph. It&#39;s not everyday that one 
has the element of surprise on me. I assure you that it won&#39;t happen 
twice.&quot;

Mina ate with a passion, which didn&#39;t surprise Beni one bit. &quot;You should 
slow down. Don&#39;t want you running out of breathing room, do we?&quot;

As she swallowed anoter mouthfull, she said &quot;Point taken; I&#39;ll be 
careful. So,&quot; As she settled down, &quot;What&#39;s happened while I was away?&quot; 
The informant&#39;s face was suddenly stern. &quot;You&#39;re sure you wanna hear it? 
You might not like what you hear...&quot; Mina stopped eating. &quot;Try me. I&#39;m a 
really good listener.&quot; &quot;Sure... fine, but I warned you.&quot;
________________________________________________________________________

Outside, a woman of age twenty had just entered the town by boat. Her 
outfit was white with a black bra. The top had a blue flame insignia on 
both sleeves, and a butterfly print on the back. The pants exposed 
almost all of her legs, save the hips. Her shoes were blue, and matched 
with the outfit quite nicely. But what surprised people the most was 
what was at her waist: A chinese double-edged sword. Her innocent look 
made it seem like she never engaged in actual combat, but she was quite 
skilled. And she had gone through quite a lot to find what she called 
her &quot;one true treasure&quot;. &quot;Seung Mina... where are you?&quot;
________________________________________________________________________

&quot;So, lemme get this straight... this &quot;evil seed&quot; is only the shards of 
the first sword that were spread by the wind?&quot; &quot;Told you. Sounds 
impossible, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; &quot;No, it makes perfect sense. A sword with that 
much influence and power could change anyone, even with a little piece 
of it!&quot; Beni was more than impressed. &quot;You know more about this than you 
let on, don&#39;t you? Anyway, those things are every where, maybe even 
here.&quot; And he cringed at the thought. &quot;I don&#39;t wanna think about it.&quot;

&#39;Neither do I... because that would mean my weapon is possesed as well! 
Then what would I do?&#39; In the midst of her dismay, she managed to say 
&quot;I&#39;m a little tired, Beni. Whrer&#39;re your rooms at?&quot; &quot;You forgot the way 
already? What&#39;s happened to you?&quot;

At the same moment, the young woman from the dock had walked into the 
bar. She didn&#39;t have to announce herself; the combination of her figure 
and her clothes made enough of a statement. &#39;Hmph. Where is she?&#39; 
&quot;Lookin&#39; fer sumthin&#39;, little woman?&quot; The lady turned around to face a 
drunkard who obviously had the wrong idea. &#39;Not you, idiot, so move.&#39; 
&quot;Did a woman wearing red and orange walk in here?&quot; &quot;&#39;Ey, what&#39;re you 
intrested in a woman for? I&#39;ve got whatcha need.&quot; &quot;Uh... okay, but I&#39;m 
not interested, so please move.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well jus&#39; lemme show you...&quot; He was cut off by a shot to the gut. 
&quot;I didn&#39;t say you could touch me, now did I? So please move... before it 
gets worse.&quot; &quot;Hey, girl. You can&#39;t do that without paying first.&quot; Three 
other drunkards stood to fight... &quot;Over here, when ya start a fight, you 
have to finish it! Right, guys?&quot; The other two said nothing, but only 
smiled and reached for their swords.
________________________________________________________________________

Sleep. A state of outward peace where the body gets to rest... yet the 
inner turmoil still exists. &#39;My weapon... my treasure. I&#39;ve had it since 
I was a baby... how could this happen?&#39; Mina had doubts from the 
beginning. Her weapon, possesed? Then it was no longer reliable! Without 
her weapon, she was... &#39;Nothing. You&#39;re naive AND predictable, you know 
that?&#39; That again. She could get no rest.

&#39;Who, or rather what, are you?&#39; &#39;It is one of those things that is 
difficult to explain. But I will tell you this: I am not a demon... 
yet.&#39; &#39;&quot;Yet&quot;? What&#39;re you saying?&#39; The stranger replied with &#39;It&#39;s 
funny... with all the world&#39;s confusion, there is nothing I can say or 
do that will convince you. That&#39;s why I speak in riddles... to make you 
think for yourself, since you say you can.&#39; That didn&#39;t help. &#39;What, no 
clues?&#39; &#39;Only this: &quot;A weapon is only a saint or demon because of the 
owner&#39;s soul.&quot;&#39;

Now, that helped, if only a little. Mina had learned much about the 
power within all human beings from both Kong and Edge Master. She began 
to consider all that she learned... and one thing came up: &quot;Where your 
mind is, there your soul is also.&quot; This is why she took up meditation 
when she got dragged home again, to clear her mind.

Once her mind was cleansed, her soul would be cleansed also, not to 
mention the fact that she felt worlds better afterwards. And if she felt 
good, she seemed to have an effect on people, and a good one at that. 
But the biggest difference was how she fought. When she fought like 
that, it made her think that she was holding back for all this time...

&#39;Hah. You&#39;ve figured it out.&#39; Mina knew the lesson. &#39;I think I have. A 
weapon is only as good or evil as the one who uses it.&#39; But she still 
had no clue. &#39;Hm. Well, then. You&#39;ll know soon enough.&#39; Silence...for 
now.
________________________________________________________________________

The fight had ended quite quickly, with Beni&#39;s help. After throwing the 
lushes out on their asses, he turned to the girl. &quot;I should kick you out 
too, but I knew that you didn&#39;t start the fight. Besides, you&#39;d have 
kicked my ass, too... miss Chai Xianghua.&quot; The warrior smiled at the 
mention of her name. &quot;You would&#39;ve figured it out anyway, Benten.&quot; &quot;And 
don&#39;t forget it. By the way, she&#39;s upstairs...&quot;
_________________________________________________________________________

Mina had finally awakened. It was late, much later than she expected to 
wake up. But the bed was so comfy that she couldn&#39;t move. But that 
wasn&#39;t the only reason: she was frozen with surprise at her new guest... 
&quot;Finally... we finally meet again, Seung Mina.&quot; She only smiled, and 
said, &quot;Hello again, Xianghua.&quot;
________________________________________________________________________

-End-

By the way, Chai Xianghua is the full name of the wielder of the Krita- 
Yuga. And Benten is the dude that I made up, in case you were curious.

- Next Chapter -

Mina begins to contemplate her relationship with Xianghua... the 
relationship that started as a friendship so long ago... may have become 
something more. </pre>
