<h1>The Seeds of Evil: Phoenix Rising (part 13 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/theone.html">The One</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../soulcal/seedsevil-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Can one truly ignore what destiny places in front of them?
No. For the evidence of it is everywhere- in every step and
around every corner. In the shadows and in the stars. From
sun to sun, it is everlasting. And the only way to get it
off your back is to face it, and accept it.


Life in My Hands
___________________________________________________________

Xianghua was sweating bullets as she assesed the situation.
Here was this man- Wolf&#39;s Fang, he was called- about to
piece her best friend up into a convienient matchbox size,
and she was not afraid. At least, not for herself. She was
afraid for the two that were behind her, now ready to attack,
seeing as Mina had now lost the advantage, only to be saved by
her weapon&#39;s defenses.

But would they continue to work for long? One could not be
sure of it- the Divine Treasures were only so competent without
energy to be fed. And at this point, it had run dry, acting on
whatever it had left.

She knew this, and felt that it was up to her to set things
in motion for Mina again. But something had stopped her... a
voice. Some kind of voice called out to her, holding her back.
It sounded calming- reassuring in a way. Still holding her
sword in the defensive, she strained to listen.

(Move not. She will be safe.)

Don&#39;t move? She had lost her weapon, and was now practicly
at her opponent&#39;s mercy. So why not move to strike?

(She will be safe. Trust in me.)

Trust in one who did not reveal their name? Laughable. If
this spirit- or whatever it was- revealed themselves, then trust
could be gained, if only a little. Did this person have a name
of sorts?

(I am given many names. In reality, the only true name is the
one that you give me, for everyone has their own truth.)

This was no time for philosophy. She was going to help her-

(Hush now. It begins...)

(Mina! No!!)
___________________________________________________________

Mina seemed to be the picture of calm, as if she had
anticipated this outcome in the first place. She hadn&#39;t, of
course; but she would not allow herself to make light of the
situation. She was prepared to do what was necessary to
protect her friends, even if her life had to end here. Xian
would be devistated, and Talim would be once again lost, but
she would be resigned to give her life anyway.

(Do not be so foolish. There is a way to win.)

She knew that! She just couldn&#39;t see one yet.

(It&#39;s simple, really. Just trust in me.)

No. She would not rely on a weapon or her technique forever.
This was a battle that would be won on her own terms, and by
her own rules. Even without a weapon. She had to prove to
herself, and no one but herself, that she could do so.

(As you wish.)

The enchantment dropped. As if on que, Fang rushed at a
speed which would seem inhuman, but was only fuled by
insanity. Mina&#39;s eyes still followed the movements, but
only barely. As the shearing, tearing claws were thrusting
forward, Mina quickly moved to her left, and as they narrowly
passed her, pulled her left leg into a crane stance.

It was then that she felt the most awkward- this was a Seung
stance, sure enough. It was just that she had not used it
enough to understand it. But nonetheless, she found herself
supporting her weight on one leg; an obvious weakness.

One which Fang made every attempt to exploit, as he swiped
his right claw at her right leg. An attack which she
expertly jumped over with a back sault, neatly landing
on her right foot on the way down to maintain her
stance. Almost instantaneously, he attacked just when she
landed with a high swipe to her chest, sure that he would hit.

Imagine his surprise when her reflexes kicked in and she
ducked under his assault, her left leg sliding forward. As
she rose up again, right in front of Fang, she delivered a
roundhouse kick to his ribs, then as he clutched his side in
pain, planted her right leg on his left shoulder and turned,
poised for a heavy left kick to the back of his head,
which she delivered.

As he was sent sliding forward, the skin of his face torn
by the road, Mina&#39;s kick had sent her into a back sault,
landing her neatly on her feet without harm.

As she stood there, regarding the man who was apparently
too crazy to know when he had already lost, she smiled.
A faint, red tinted light surrounded her, as if her
confidence and determination could be seen and felt. She
issued a warning to the fallen, insane man before her:

&quot;You&#39;re out of your league. Go home and leave us alone,
before I really hurt you.&quot;
___________________________________________________________

Talim was in awe.

(What manner of woman is this? Even without a weapon,
she still bests her opponent! She&#39;s like a fire that
refuses to go out...)

But her senses were still alert, still listening. Her
ears listened, straining to hear the winds, hear their
cries and calls. And without her knowing, her very soul
aided her in this.

Thus, every whisper and moan in the wind had been
intensified thousand fold; every unnatural shift of
the wind rang in her ears like bells, and for a moment,
she felt faint.

(What&#39;s this? I can hear it... I can hear everything!
What&#39;s going on?)

But she had no more time to think, as she heard what
she was looking for. Someone was coming from behind her,
moving at attack speed. The faint sound of something
cutting its path through the air was as loud to
her as someone&#39;s scream at point-blank range.

On instinct, she raised one of her elbow blades in
a half circle, just behind her, and heard the telltale
ring of something reflecting off of it. Following through
with the movement, she turned to shove the butt of the
other bladed tonfa into the agressor&#39;s gut...

And saw nothing.

Her eyes shifted among the crowds that had gathered
to watch the battle, looking for who had just tried to
hit her with either a rock or a dart. Which one, she
was not sure of, but she could guess.

She saw and heard three men eariler that day,
but only one was here. The tall, lanky one that fouled
the very air around him with his madness.

That left quite a few questions... where were the other
two? Why did she get the feeling that they were after
more than just that woman back at the inn?

The questions stopped when she heard it again. The sound of
something hurtling through the air at a rate that was much
faster than a rock. Definitely a dart, and probably poisoned.
Her body moved faster than her mind, the training that was
beat into it now coming to fruition. She raised her left
elbow blade and heard the sound of not one... but two.

The assailant was determined now.

She dragged Xianghua along with her as she began to
flee, hoping that Mina would forgive her for abandoning
her at this important time. However, she was protecting
both of them...

It was the least Talim could do to protect Xianghua, and
leave Mina free to take care of her current problem.

Thus, she fled. And sure enough, she heard someone behind
her.
___________________________________________________________

The man of medium build- Tashiro was his name- was
calmly standing in the crowd, assesing the situation.

The woman in red was in battle with Fang, defending
the honor of a woman that she had barely even met, much
less had befriended. And she was doing so with all
the calm and grace of one with her skill.

(So, this must be the one who had won the tournament.
Impressive. And the other two must be her friends...)

He regarded them as well, taking his attention from
that idiot subordinate of his. One of them looked like
a native, the cheekbones and petit, shapely body very
much at home.

That didn&#39;t faze him at all... the fact that she had an
intricate tai chi sword in her hand did. And with the way
that she held it, she looked like she had been using the
damn thing since she was born.

(A threat. Not good for me, seeing as I want to do this
as painlessly as possible. On both sides.)

Then, he saw the other. A girl of no more than fifteen,
holding what appeared to be two bladed tonfas in her hands.
The weapons seemed ceremonial at best, and were thus useless
to her.

(Ah, there we go. A target.)

Of course, killing was out of the question. He only needed
her unconcious, for the time being. Then, he could use her
for... other means. Like getting information about the
Ultimate Treasure...

The Soul Edge.

He grinned wolfishly, just thinking about it. If he
had that sword, he would hand it to the pirates and be
done with them for good. Riches beyond measure would
be his reward, and he could die a very happy man...

The very thought of the treasures goaded him into action.
He pulled from his coat a small, 7&quot; blow gun, each tip
coated with a special chemical that would render any
targets unconcious for a good four hours- long enough
to move her to a more secure location.

She was a sitting duck. He smiled as he put the
blow gun to his lips... fired a dart..

And stared wordlessly as she quite easily deflected the
oncoming dart without looking, before turning and thrusting
the back end of her opposite weapon into an invisible target.
A target that could have been him.

With a speed and silence that was uncanny, he moved from his
position to a better one to her left. Okay, so he had guessed
wrong about her weapons. Perhaps they weren&#39;t just ceremonial
after all- she had turned them into efficient tools for
defending herself.

She was looking, scanning the crowd for him. She would
find nothing. The smug look on his face now replaced by
one of concentration and determination, he readied two
darts this time, aiming both of them for her pulse line.

He fired... and scowled as both darts were blocked. It were
as if she could hear the darts moving through the wind as
he fired them! Then, he shook off that notion. They moved
far too quickly for that- it was damn-near-impossible.

And then, he blinked, shook his head, and growled softly.

(Why the hell do they always have to run?)
___________________________________________________________

Mina knew perfectly well that they were fleeing, running
from someone. She could feel Talim&#39;s mind working, planning
a way out. Apparently, she had found one in a nearby alley,
and the man from before was chasing them.

She was somewhat greatful for this, and afraid at the same
time. She was free, yes. But Talim was apparently the target,
and whatever they wanted from her could not be good...

(Take care of her, Xian...)

She was snapped out of her thoughts by Fang&#39;s incredulous
and rage-laced voice.

&quot;My face... damn you, you ruined my FACE!!&quot;

Sure enough, as he rose to his feet with a startling speed,
his face was torn and bleeding, the road and gravity
doing its work well. Mina face-faulted.

(He&#39;s bleeding and probably in more pain than I can imagine,
and all he can think of is his face?)

Oh, yes, he was insane. And his scream of rage, along
with his wanton, headlong rush, proved it. Fang stabbed
forward with both claws in a maddening, bloodthirsty
assault, aiming for her stomach.

Mina had little time to react, less time to dodge,
and no time to think. Her body moved with all the grace
and skill of a seasoned warrior, the years of dicipline
paying off. She hopped to the left, moving into crane stance
instinctively. Kick to the shin, kick to the head. The heel
of her left foot slammed into his temple, making him
reel back with stars in his eyes.

However, this only made him slash blindly in the direction
from which he was hit. But it was only that- a blind slash,
and easy to avoid. Mina slid underneath the attack...

And the man grinned. He knew perfectly well that she would
make the same attempt at the same move as last time. He
was ready this time, with his claw at his waist, ready to
tear into her leg should the need arise.

The kick never came.

Mina leapt from her low position, her right leg snapping
upwards and outwards, hitting Fang clean on the chin as
she rose. With a cry of surprise and pain, he was sent
airborne along with Mina...

Then was soon sent back down to earth with a vengance
as the right leg came down in a high, overhead circle,
slamming onto his midsection with the force of a truck
at about 45 miles per hour.

It might seem like a slow speed... but it still
hurts like hell. And this particular kick sent
him crashing to the ground. The aid of gravity&#39;s pull
made the impact that much more devastating...

And *BOOM*.
___________________________________________________________

&quot;W-what&#39;s going on, Talim? Explain yourself!&quot;

Being dragged through the back alleys of Beijing were not
all that great for Xianghua, and she wanted to slow
down and piece together the situation, so she could find
a good enough reason to be torn away from Mina.

Talim had a fierce blush on her face, probably due to the
close proximity of Xianghua at the moment, but managed to
explain herself.

&quot;A man attacked me earlier, and he&#39;s following us.
I don&#39;t think he wants to talk to us about anything, and
Mina was busy... so I thought that it was best to run away.&quot;

Xianghua was stunned- half at the fact that she didn&#39;t
sense the man&#39;s approach, and half with worry for Mina.
She was somewhat angry at Talim for just running off like
that...

&quot;And you just left her there? To fight him by herself?&quot;

Talim&#39;s blush deepened- she was already ashamed of simply
leaving her to her fate, running off like a scared child.
And now, Xianghua had to rub it in! She started to get
a little angry herself...

&quot;I had no choice! She would&#39;ve been distracted by
having to protect us both! And then what? She would
have lost, and he would have no qualms about killing her.&quot;

Xianghua backed off at this. It was a logical decision
to make, and she found herself blushing at her mistaken
anger. Essentially, she had saved them all, and had given
Mina some precious time to form sone kind of defense.

&quot;I see. You did the right thing, then. Sorry for-&quot;

Talim shook her head at this.

&quot;It&#39;s just as much my fault. If I had faced him, I wouldn&#39;t
have to leave her in the first place. I&#39;m no good at fighting
all that much, so I just run sometimes. Is that bad?&quot;

They turned another corner. Surely they would&#39;ve lost him by
now? But no matter. It was better that they didn&#39;t keep
track of where they were going anyway.

&quot;Nope, not at all. You&#39;re smart enough to run when
you have to- I&#39;ll give you that. I respect you for
admitting all that, too. But there&#39;s just one problem...&quot;

Talim responded, without looking back, &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

Her friend then made a very interesting query about their
situation- one that would be hard to awnser...

&quot;Do you have another plan besides running?&quot;
___________________________________________________________

Bear was definitely not having a good afternoon.

First of all, he wasn&#39;t lucky enough to bed that wench
on the second floor... second, he couldn&#39;t keep up with the
boss when he had gone off to chase those two girls... and to
top it all off, he was bored, bloodthirsty, and running
out of ideas for amusement.

(Maybe I should&#39;ve stayed back at the hideaway...)

Usually, thses things didn&#39;t happen to him, but today,
his karma... or whatever, was catching up to him. He
suddenly felt bad about all the bad things that he had
done... but only for a brief second. Then, he walked on his
way, finally moving at a leisurely pace.

It was then that he felt something bump into him. Twice.

Well, not exactly felt. More like barely registered.
But it was there nonetheless, and he looked down.

His yellow, rotting teeth were exposed in a malicious
grin. Perhaps his luck had improved after all...

The two girls that were being chased had run into him
and fell hard, as if slamming into a brick wall. He
raised his fist at the older looking one- he cared not
about age or height, only reward- and swung.

And just as she looked up, an expression of pure shock
on her face, it was lights out for a certain Chai Xianghua.

(Heh.. now for the other one. As far as I could tell,
he wanted this one alive...)

Slowly, he walked toward Talim, a glint of greed and
malice in his eyes...
___________________________________________________________

Mina frowned distastefully at the fallen man before her.

(How does he do it? He just won&#39;t stay down. He must
have a high tolerance for pain.)

She casually waited for him to compose himself. If
she had not learned anything during her time abroad, it
was to give the opponent the honor of actually standing
to fight, instead of kicking them while they were down.

(Well if he wants it, he&#39;ll get it.)

Fang stood and growled menacingly at her. He was bleeding,
unbalanced, and angry, not to mention out of his mind.
He had been slowly heading in that direction for the
duration of the fight, and seemed to break, now that he
had been sent back to earth with a punishing blow.

&quot;SHI-NE!&quot;

His rush, however, was halted by another voice. One
that was calm and confident. A voice that came from
behind her.

&quot;That&#39;s enough, Fang.&quot;

She whirled and was met with a sight that horrified her.
The biggest man she had ever seen, along with a much smaller
one. Well built, dressed in a yukata, and with a short sword
on his left hip. He expertly twirled a blow gun between the
fingers of his right hand, and he had an appraising look
in his eyes.

But he did not frighten her.

What did was the fact that Xianghua was falling rapidly
towards the ground, the bruise on her left cheek starting to
purple, and the unconcious (but perfectly fine) Talim
hoisted over the big man&#39;s shoulder.

As she hit the floor with a sickening crack, Mina&#39;s eyes
widened in fear as she rushed to her aid.

(No... no, Xian! Don&#39;t leave me now! We haven&#39;t even
started the journey!)

&quot;Idiots, both of you... it wasn&#39;t supposed to go this way.
Why do I even bother?&quot;

Her eyes narrowed dangerously. The aura of calm and
determination was turning into one of sadness, shock,
and anger. And as such, it began to flare and grow in
intensity, as if she were on fire...

&quot;Did you do this?&quot;

The man smiled at her, a knowing, calm smile.

&quot;No... but I cannot control the actions of my associates.
However, this does place us in a position to do business.&quot;

Mina&#39;s anger was barely concealed as she spoke in a calm,
measured tone. Usually a bad sign.

&quot;Couldn&#39;t you simply talk to us in our room, instead of
doing something like this? You would have a little more
respect from me if you had.&quot;

He shrugged, as if he had no reason to explain himself.

&quot;I heard an interesting rumor earlier today... you were
the one who won the tournament just recently, am I correct?
And on top of that, you seem to be looking for something.&quot;

She scoffed at him, almost a laugh if the situation were
humorous. He simply ignored her, as if she were nothing?
And after one of his cronies had tried to kill her and
hurt her friends, dumping one of them on the street
and leaving her for dead?

Hell no!

&quot;We have nothing to discuss. Tell your buddy to
put Talim down, and I promise that you&#39;ll get away...
without anyone dying.&quot;

He frowned, as if there were a bad taste in his mouth.
Why did things always have to end like this? He sighed.
Such was the life of a theif...

&quot;Oh, I think we do. I have reason to believe that you
and your friends are involved with Soul Edge. Our
boss is looking for the fabled Sword, and he will
pay handsomely for it.&quot;

Her false humor evaporated at this. They knew...
somehow, they knew. But she couldn&#39;t let him get
to her this easily. Besides, he was starting to piss
her off.

&quot;So you know. So what? And what makes you think
that I&#39;m in this for money? You&#39;re wasting your
time. Put her down and walk away. Matter of fact,
run away. Fast.&quot;

He shook her threat off, shooing it away with one hand.

&quot;Now, now... no reason to fuss. We wouldn&#39;t want
an accident to come of your friends.&quot;

She stopped cold, her gaze unwavering. She gritted her
teeth and gave him a stare that would have burned, had
she actually been ablaze. For a brief moment her eyes
turned green... then settled again.

&quot;If you&#39;d like to actually speak without throwing
insults and threats all day, you can meet us at
the port, in our hideaway. Of course, you won&#39;t be
able to find it easily- it is a hidden location after
all. Let&#39;s go, you two.&quot;

Fang quickly stood up and, with a movement that
almost made him seem to vanish, he suddenly
was right next to Mina. He smiled wickedly and
whispered into her ear before walking away.

&quot;I&#39;ll kill you next time... and I won&#39;t hold
back anymore.&quot;

And as they walked away, and the crowds thinned, she
felt herself drain of her strength and energy, her
aura fading. As she slumped to her knees on the road,
she sobbed.

Powerless. Hopeless. Utterly pathetic. Childish.

She cried. And cried. And cried.

(Talim... Xianghua... Forgive me.)

-End-

Yup this was a long one. Took me a good while to
do this one. But it&#39;s here, and done, and good.

Or is it? You tell me. You know the drill. Visit the thread
and lemme know what you think!

In which Talim is used as a pawn, and at the same time,
admits to herself that she could be in love, when she
doesn&#39;t even know what love is.

In which Xianghua has a moral dilemma with not keeping
her promise to her friend.

And in which Mina discovers that there is another side
to her that not even she knew about. A side that had
been within her throughout her entire life...</pre>
