<h1>Unexpected (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soulcal/index.html">Soul Caliber</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/asanuma.html">Asanuma Toshiro</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Souls, come unto me!&quot;

This is what I hear before I backflip out of the montstrous blade&#39;s way, 
all the while gazing into the eye that stares at me through the weapon. 
The look in it&#39;s eyes is somewhat taunting, yet needy. Then as I am 
trying to dodge the blade&#39;s swings, I peer through the obsidian/blue 
armor to see fire red eyes, but with the same look as the blade.

&#39;He is almost taken completely. They are almost one. I have to stop 
him!&#39;, I think to myself.

I feel a huge pain on my back as I am hurled into the walls of 
Ostrheinsburg Chapel. I try to shake off the weariness, but to no avail. 
I can smell the blood flowing freely from my hip, all the way down to my 
leg as my vision begins to blur. I hear the armor getting closer to me 
and I look up, trying to grab my sword, which now appears to be three 
halves of the Orichalcum, the other defensive half, in my left hand. I 
see a huge armored foot stepping on the offensive half of my weapon as I 
gaze into those fiery red eyes again.

&quot;This is the end!&quot;, is what I hear as I close my eyes and brace for the 
impact of what would be, my untimely death. As I begin to see less, I 
hear footsteps running towards his direction. I then hear the tip if a 
curved blade hit the chapel&#39;s floor with the words that I still 
remember..

&quot;Goodbye!&quot;

In my near death state, I can still hear a cry of anguish, followed by 
sounds of fire and faint smells of flesh being burned. 

&#39;I am done for&#39;, I think to myself. And with that, I can see, smell, 
hear, touch, nor taste anymore.

I feel a damp cloth on my forehead with smells of herbal tea brewing. I 
can hear the footsteps on wood in which what feels like a small cabin of 
some sort. All I can think of is the fight with Nightmare, and my failed 
attempt to free Siegfried, the one man who understood me.

&quot;Oh you&#39;re up already?!&quot;, I hear a familiar voice as I snap out of my 
trance.

My nose is tickled with the smells of wildflower and herbal tea beside 
me. I look up to see almond brown eyes looking into mine, full of 
concern. By the red and yellow headband and the smell of wildflower, I 
know it is Seung Mina. The Korean woman who has always been there for me 
and I am guessing, the one who saved me. Her hair is let loose, already 
on my shoulders with the same softness as it has always had. She is 
wearing her normal battle outfit with the short red and gold tanktop 
with the pale green collar. She has a few cuts and bruises on her skin, 
typical of a warrior like her.

&#39;She is so beautiful&#39;, I think to myself.

&quot;Can you move?&quot;, she asks.

I move my arms and legs, giving her the answer. Before I know it I am 
raised up my her soft, strong arms and held in her embrace. I raise my 
arms up to her neck, to return the embrace, indulging in the sweet scent 
that she has possessed since she was in my life. 

She begins to sob softly, I know she is trying to hold it in.

&quot;I was so scared that you wouldn&#39;t make it. Nightmare is one strong 
fighter&quot;, she says inbetween sobs.

She lets go and looks into my deep blue eyes, smiling with her eyes full 
of tears. I begin to sob as well, thanking the gods who have granted me 
such a wonderful person to come into my life.

She embraces me again, this time her sobbing stops. I rest my head on 
her shoulder, my insides burning up due to happiness.

&quot;How did you save me?&quot;, I ask.

&quot;I charged up all the energy I had and struck Nightmare from behind, 
causing him to burn and disappear into flames&quot;, she explains.

That must have been the voice I heard.

&quot;And what about Nightmare?&quot;, I ask again.

&quot;The flames died out, along with Soul Edge, so I guess he&#39;s gone for 
now&quot;, she sighs.

&#39;Oh no, Siegfried..&quot;, I think to myself.

&quot;I&#39;m so glad that you&#39;re alive! You were in bed for 2 days!&quot;, she cries 
out.

I am snapped out of my internal cry when I feel her shake with 
excitement.

&#39;I have to get over it. Siegfried is gone. Might as well move on&#39;, I say 
to myself.

&quot;Thank you, Mina&quot;, I say to her, tightening my grip around her back.

She begins to sway me from side to side and I can feel her warmness. I 
wonder if she can feel my wetness under the blanket..

&quot;Come on, you have to wash up and eat!&#39;, she drags me out of the futon 
in which I was resting in.

&#39;Good, she didn&#39;t see or feel. Go me&#39;, I say to myself.

And with that I wash my body in the hot springs and get ready for 
breakfast.




Author&#39;s note : This is my first fanfic. I would really appreciate 
reviews, even flames. I haven&#39;t wrote in awhile so if the grammar sucks, 
then please let me know. You can email me. Things get more interesting 
in Part 2, where Sophitia starts to find herself. (If you know what I 
mean :P). Other than that, I hope you enjoyed it.
