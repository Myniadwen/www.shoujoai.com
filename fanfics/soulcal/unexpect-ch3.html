<a href="../soulcal/unexpect-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Author&#39;s note : This is Chapter 3 of my Soul Calibur fanfic, 
&quot;Unexpected&quot;. I would like to thank those who have reviewed my fic. I 
really appreciate it and I hope you enjoy Chapter 3.


&quot;I never intended to..&quot;

Those were the words she said to me. To cease my tears. To leave me 
speechless. To make me happy. I tighten my grip around her waist, 
feeling her soft delicate skin grow warm with my touch. She tightens her 
grip around my neck, making me grow warm inside.

She brings her head to my shoulder and whispers  into my ear, &quot;I&#39;m sorry 
Sophie.. I don&#39;t know what got into me..&quot;, she says, not knowing the 
pleasure she was sending through my body.

I go down to her ear and whisper to her, &quot;It&#39;s alright. I don&#39;t know 
what got into me.&quot;

I begin to ponder those feelings for a while, leaving the room silent. 
What was I feeling? My thoughts are interrupted when I feel a warm and 
wet tongue lap around my earlobe, causing me to moan softly and leaving 
some evidence in my panties.

She knows of my satisfaction and continues, this time letting her lips 
suckle on my wet lobe, causing me to moan even more. She then kisses me 
under the lobe, exploring the next area which would be my jawbone.

She kisses me on my jawbone then she moves down to my neck, suckling and 
kissing softly, leaving little wet marks on my neck, causing me to feel 
asphyxiated.

Before I can say anything, she entwines our hands in a grip that couples 
would make and I feel my body being pushed back, with hers in hot 
pursuit. She&#39;s so warm, I think to myself.

&quot;You *kiss* have *kiss* no *kiss* idea *kiss* how *kiss* long *kiss* 
I&#39;ve *suckle* been *nibble* waiting *kiss* for this *suckle* moment..&quot;, 
she says inbetween her manuevers.

&quot;Oh Mina...it feels so good...&quot;, I moan to her.

&quot;Mm...Sophie...you taste good...&quot;, she says to me, while continuing to 
work on my neck, not letting me catch my breath.

&quot;Mina...you feel good...&quot;,are the only words I can think of at the 
moment.

She stops the kissing for a minute and looks at me with her sparkling 
brown eyes, easily piercing my blue eyes.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;, I ask her.

She just smiles and brushes her nose with mine, wiggling it from left to 
right, tickling my nose.

I follow suit and soon both of our noses are wiggling, from left to 
right, brushing the tips, leaving a big smile on my face.

She gives me a seductive smile and slows down the pace of our nose 
wiggling.

&quot;Sophie..&quot;, I hear her say, while slowing down my wiggling to match her 
own.

&quot;I love you..&quot;, she says as our noses stop at each other&#39;s tips.

Might as well say it now eh?

&quot;I love you too, Mina..&quot;, I whisper to her.

And with that she presses her soft lips on mine, opening a little crack 
in her mouth to let her tongue out to explore my mouth. Soon enough, our 
tongues are playfighting with each other, fighting for the last bit of 
ambrosia lurking in our mouthes. We pull away a few minutes later, 
leaving a small trail of what appears to be, a fusion of our honey, 
hanging in the balance of our lips. She smiles at me and presses her 
lips on mine again, fiercely pinning my tongue down to get all the 
liquid she can get.

This must be the calvary.

I decide to fight back and once again, our tongues are waging war on 
each other, fighting for the ambrosia, won and lost. She pushes her body 
more into mine, her smaller breasts being pushed onto mine. I feel her 
ferocity building as she growls into my mouth, still fighting for the 
liquid and tightening her grip on my hands.  I decide I have to do 
something.

I quickly roll over and change our positions quickly, without breaking 
the kiss. My tongue is let on an all out offensive on her victim mouth 
as I soon claim more of the sweet liquid to myself. We go back and 
forth, indulging in the sweet honey of each other, attacking and 
receiving, until we pull away for breath.

I have greater stamina then her. Thank the gods for that.

I finish catching my breath before her and pounce on her again, this 
time kissing and sucking her neck fiercely, leaving little red marks on 
her neck. She gasps and moans for more, tightening the grip on our hands 
once again. I move up to her earlobe and bite it, which sends waves of 
ecstasy through her body, leaving her reeling. I then move to her 
collarbone and bite there, causing her to arch her back and moan louder 
than before.

While her back is arched, I take that time to get her arms out of the 
sleeveless top, kissing and sucking on her shoulders and neck, causing 
her to breathe heavier than before. I take my right hand and begin to 
massage her left breast, which is still being clinged on to by her top. 
I massage it through the top, pushing it up and around, in a counter 
clockwise motion, all the while sucking on her neck and collarbone.

&quot;Oh..Sophie..that&#39;s great...&quot;, she moans to me as I take my other hand 
to massage her breasts, every once in a while I stop to tweak and 
squeeze her nipples, causing them to grow even more erect.

She continues calling my name, and I continue to answer her while 
kissing her all over her chest and neck. I then take the remnants of her 
top in my mouth and bring out down, to expose her ivory white breasts. I 
notice the little pink nubs on her lumps are swelling and I take one in 
my mouth and the other in my hand, sucking and nibbling on it, while 
tweaking and lightly pinching the other. She grabs my head and pushes it 
deeper into her pillow of soft skin, causing me to suck harder. I 
cherish every breath I take, for it fills my nose with her wildflower 
scent, which turns me on even more.

Her moaning is now louder, maybe even hearable in the other rooms, but 
who cares? No one is at home except for the two of us.

As I continue to suck and nibble on her breasts, I feel her hands 
tugging at the silk gown she gave to me. I feel it being pulled up, 
causing a chill to rise up in my wet panties. I stop for a minute to let 
her remove the gown, covering my larger breasts with my arms, blushing 
at her. She smiles at me, and then pounces on me, kissing and sucking 
hard on my cleavage, leaving a red mark there. She takes one breast in 
her hand and massages it, this time in a clockwise motion, while she 
dives apon my left breast with her mouth, sucking and nibbling on the 
nipple, giving me the same treatment that I gave to her.

Her touch is making me hot and cold. I have goosebumps all over me and I 
feel warm, wherever she touches me. I can&#39;t help but call her name, in 
my moans of ecstasy, as she kisses and sucks on my breasts, leaving 
little wet marks and causing my nipples to swell. She takes notice of 
this and pushes my breasts together, and takes both nipples in her 
mouth, causing me to grab her head and push it closer, sending wave 
after wave of ecstasy throughout my body.

She lets one hand trail down to where my panties cling to, rubbing the 
soft wet spot that has been awakened ever since I saw her. She presses 
softly, rubbing her fingers in a small clockwise motion, causing me to 
straddle my hips to her finger&#39;s movements, while she continues to kiss 
and suck on my breasts.

She presses deeper through the panties, causing them to be more 
drenched, while she continues to do a number on me, top and bottom. I 
continue to let out moans and continue to call her name, forcing me to 
stop and try to catch my breath. The pleasure is just so invigorating, 
I&#39;ve never felt this good.

She pulls away the panties, as I lift my leg to let her remove them. She 
kisses my lips and smiles, then thrusts her index finger into my 
crevice, causing me to yelp and arch my back, causing my muscles to 
tighten around her finger. 

As soon as I catch my breath, my muscles lighten the grip on her finger, 
giving her permission to enter further. She pushes it in deeper, causing 
me to gasp and hold my breath for a second, only to lose it the next 
second as she thrusts her finger in and out my tight entrance.

Oh my, her finger feels so good inside of me. I plead for more and more, 
and she continues to thrust faster, soon finding my clitoris and 
pinching it with her middle finger and thumb, causing me to scream her 
name like I never did before. She stops for a second to let me catch my 
breath but I tell her to go on.

She continues to thrust, but in a clockwise motion and still pinching on 
my clitoris. I&#39;m beginning to feel lightheaded, as she continues to 
thrust harder and faster into my entrance. She then goes down there and 
kisses my clitoris, slipping her tongue in a long warm lick, causing me 
to tighten my grip on the sheets and also causing me to drool. She 
continues to lick and suck on my clit and lips, as I buck my hips up and 
down for more.

Soon enough, I see white. She nibbles on my clit, making me scream her 
name in a higher volume, letting my vagina explode into her mouth, 
filling her with my liquids, making me feel as if on fire and ice, with 
a little hint of electricity.

I begin to drool again, with a huge smile on my face, as she comes up 
and kisses my lips, letting me taste my own orgasm. And how sweet it 
does taste.

I kiss her again, this time swapping the liquids into her mouth.

&quot;I love you Mina..&quot;, are my last words(or breaths) as I fall asleep in 
her warm arms.
