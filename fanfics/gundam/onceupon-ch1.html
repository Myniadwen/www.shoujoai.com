<h1>Once Upon a Time and Far Away</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alithea.html">Alithea</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;What are you up to&quot;, Nichol asked leaning across the freshly polished 
desk. His dark eyes squinting as he tried to read the title of the 
young woman&#39;s book.

She ignored him flipping the page of the sturdy leather bound volume, 
her fingers underlining the words as she read them. A queer and nearly 
triumphant grin was settled on her lips. She could feel his irritation 
growing as his breath was released in short huffs. Her left hand 
reached for a pair of ghastly looking reading glasses, and she brought 
them over to the bridge of her nose, never letting them settle, 
holding them just so she could make out the print.

Nichol ran a hand through his dark curls, which were unruly and a bit 
more unkempt than he would have liked. &quot;Dotty&quot;, he stated hoping the 
unwelcome nickname would steer her attention. &quot;Dorothy&quot;, his voice was 
set in a low whine.

With a sigh she set her glasses aside and looked over at him, stormy 
blue eyes less than amused as she spoke, &quot;Yes Toto.&quot;

&quot;Charming. Am I interrupting? Possibly boring you&quot; he asked and 
slouched back uncomfortably into a wooden chair. 

&quot;Yes. And yes&#133; but since I doubt those answers will make you go away&#133; 
What do you want?&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re up to something.&quot; He crossed his arms over his chest. 

&quot;I&#39;m studying.&quot; 

&quot;Aha! See&#133;you are up to something.&quot; 

&quot;If you cared to pay attention you&#39;d know that I, unlike you, study 
quite frequently. Besides why would I be up to something in the middle 
of midterms?&quot; She picked up the glasses again and began to read.

His scowl was something she would normally comment on as precious but 
she was busy. He tapped his fingers along the desk and cleared his 
throat causing one of the other students to utter a shushing sound, 
which he sneered at.

&quot;Dorothy?&quot; 

&quot;Yes darling&quot;, she was clearly annoyed. Shutting her book with a loud 
thump and tossing her glasses on top of it. 

His dark eyes met her blue and she knew he was attempting to read her 
but he was altogether sloppy at it. He never got things right. 

&quot;You aren&#39;t up to anything? No little speck of revenge after what the 
princess did?&quot; 

Dorothy smiled like a cat that had just swallowed a canary. &quot;That was 
over a year ago Nicky.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;d prefer you didn&#39;t-&quot; 

&quot;I know. Look&#133; I&#39;m not going to exact any sort of revenge. She&#39;d enjoy 
that way too much. I&#39;m just going to study and do my work&#133;play a 
little when I have the time and maybe undertake that challenge of 
yours. But until then please do your best not to pry&quot;, she whispered 
trying not to disturb those around her.

&quot;Year or no&#133; I still think you&#39;re up to something. You have your 
hunting face on.&quot; 

&quot;Do I?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, and as your closest friend I&#39;d like to know what you&#39;re chasing 
after.&quot; 

&quot;So you can beat me to it? I think not&quot;, Dorothy beamed as she stood 
up, chair scraping along the floor. 

She grabbed her bag and the book she was reading quickly. Shuffling 
over to the counter to check out what she needed with Nichol in tow. 

He nearly towered above her, a lanky and wiry frame that hid his more 
toned features. They had met in the university library two years 
earlier, Nichol smitten from the first by Dorothy&#39;s goddess like 
charm. She was always above everything, but never looking down on 
others, never snobbish. However, she could be kindly rude, putting 
people quickly in place as needed. A stark contrast to his almost 
raging bitterness she was a delight to have around even if his 
romantic chances with her were as great as his youthful fantasy of 
obediently sweeping his favorite professor of her feet. 

Dorothy disliked his hovering as she waited for the librarian to tally 
up her growing stack of books. &quot;Nichol&#133; If I tell you will you be a 
good boy and leave me alone.&quot;

&quot;Possibly.&quot; 

She thanked the librarian and motioned for Nichol to help her with 
some of the bigger, heavier, more taxing books. He grunted as he slid 
them off the counter and into his arms. 

&quot;Do you really need to take all these back with you?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; 

It was a short walk to Dorothy&#39;s car. The sky was dark, remains of 
clouds lingering in a near perfect night sky. The two piled the books 
in the trunk and made the quick drive to her small apartment. He was 
surprisingly quiet the entire way there. She hummed a song she was due 
to sing in the schools up coming production, a new musical pieced 
together by fairy tales and random Greek myths. 

Finally within the safe grounds of Dorothy&#39;s apartment complex Nichol 
vocalized his frustration with the books, while Dorothy took in deep 
breaths to avoid saying anything too terribly rude.

She liked Nichol, but lately he was edging on her better nerves. She 
considered for a moment and realized that he had been treading over 
her good side in army boots since she had mentioned taking a liking to 
his sworn enemy. It was a childish thing but she assumed Nichol had a 
right to his insecurities. 

&quot;Thank God you live on the first floor&quot;; Nichol puffed as they stopped 
at her door. 

She fumbled with the key for a minute and then opened the door. He 
nearly fell in quickly disposing of the large collection of books by 
placing them on the floor near the couch.

&quot;Drink&quot;, Dorothy offered. 

&quot;No. I can&#39;t really stay...but before I leave would you mind telling 
me what&#39;s going on?&quot; 

Dorothy brushed back her long platinum blonde hair as she took a seat 
on the couch, reaching down to collect a book and place it in her lap, 
&quot;I&#39;m going to tutor someone... Soon actually so it&#39;s very well that 
you can&#39;t stay around.&quot;

He arched an eyebrow. &quot;Who?&quot; 

&quot;That lovely star of the track team. You know with the violet eyes&quot;, 
Dorothy searched for her place as she thumbed the book open. &quot;You 
remember you said she looked too much like a physical education major 
to even consider.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I do recall that. She does though. Is she not?&quot; 

&quot;History and political science, with a minor English literature&quot;, was 
her reply, eyes on her book. 

&quot;Hmph.&quot; 

Dorothy looked up and smiled. 

His eyes went wide; &quot;You can not be serious. She&#39;s&#133; She&#39;s&#133; egad Dotty 
she&#39;s just so butch. Why would you even dare? And let&#39;s forget the 
butch but my god you do know who she&#39;s dating?&quot;

&quot;Officially, Mr. Peacecraft number 10 and star quarterback. 
Unofficially&#133; well there are some names but I&#39;ll refrain from bringing 
them into it. She&#39;s not butch either&quot;, she added matter-of-factly.

&quot;I feel ill.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s just studying Nichol. Besides did I say anything when you 
started chasing after that predictably frail gymnast?&quot; 

&quot;Her name was Cathy and she was-&quot; 

&quot;Too sweet for you to stand.&quot; 

&quot;That too.&quot; He leaned into the wall. &quot;Anyway&#133; what exactly are you 
tutoring her in?&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s having some trouble in her mythology class.&quot; 

He made a face that crossed between a sneer and a smile, &quot;What a 
lovely alibi. I suppose the football player is too wrapped up in the 
up coming games to notice.&quot;

&quot;Or too wrapped up in the assistant coach. It is a rather strange 
relationship. I don&#39;t try and understand it.&quot; 

&quot;Of course not, you just&#133;&#39;tutor&#39;.&quot; 

The doorbell rang and Nichol shook his head. &quot;I bet that&#39;s her.&quot; 

&quot;Uncanny isn&#39;t it&quot;; Dorothy quipped. &quot;But then timing is everything.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, too bad she&#39;s a sprinter.&quot; 

Dorothy nudged him with her elbow as she walked passed to open the 
door. He rubbed the sore spot as he chuckled. 

&quot;Do be polite on your way out&quot;, she reminded. 

&quot;Oh honestly as if I&#39;m ever rude to someone you&#39;re &#39;tutoring&#39;&quot;, Nichol 
said as he opened the door. 

Disappointment reigned as an elderly man in a Hawaiian shirt and dark 
sunglasses holding a bouquet of red roses greeted him. Dorothy shook 
her head as she pushed her friend aside to greet the man.

&quot;Hello Howard&quot;, she said. 

&quot;Hey kid! These came for you this afternoon. Thought I&#39;d drop them off 
for you&quot;, he handed her the bouquet with a smile.

&quot;Thank you. You&#146;re the best apartment manager ever&quot;, she replied 
waving goodbye and shutting the door. 

Nichol had taken a seat on the couch, dark eyes on the roses. &quot;If 
those are from your sprinter I&#39;ll gag.&quot; 

The blonde goddess checked the card and as she read it one of Nichol&#39;s 
favorite expressions slid over Dorothy&#39;s face. It was the one she wore 
when she thought herself particularly exceptional, and it told him 
there was more going on than the occasional tutoring session. 

&quot;So, who are they from?&quot; He arched an eyebrow, crossing his arms over 
his chest authoritatively. 

&quot;No one you get to know about.&quot; 

&quot;Oh?&quot; 

&quot;Much too soon for you to find out.&quot; 

He huffed, &quot;I knew it. I knew you were really up to something.&quot; 

&quot;Yes well... I congratulate your observant nature&quot;, she paused, taking 
the roses into the kitchen and placing them in a large vase. &quot;Don&#39;t 
you have to be somewhere&quot;, she asked as she wound her way back into 
her small living room. 

&quot;I did but I think I should stay until you tell me what you&#39;re 
plotting.&quot; 

&quot;A novel idea but I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll just be sitting here in the dark 
for a few hours.&quot; 

Nichol was confused, &quot;And you&#39;re little study session? Don&#39;t you have 
to wait for that?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m afraid something&#39;s come up.&quot; 

&quot;Have to take care of some gardening?&quot; 

&quot;Nichol you are so precious when you&#39;re jealous, but it does look 
quiet awful on you&quot;, Dorothy said triumphantly. 

&quot;It looks worse on women&quot;, he grumbled. &quot;You remember that.&quot; 

&quot;I always do Nicky. I&#39;d dare not forget.&quot; 

Once upon a time 
And far away today 
I saw the dawn rising 
In a sky cool and gray 
And the color washed to blue 
And something light 
New&#133; 
There in the distance 
I caught the first glimpse of you 
You wanted your heart 
Wanted it whole and untouched 
Never thinking of what it would mean 
If you loved and then too much 

The campus was extremely well lit at night, so much so Dorothy often 
wondered how any of the students in the dorms got any sleep. But the 
light was for the safety of the student body, more specifically the 
female population of the campus. She was always careful regardless; 
walking with such confident assurance that even other students had a 
tendency to move out of her way. 

She checked her watch as she entered the library once more. She had 
nearly an hour before closing and so went upstairs where the 
anthropology books were kept, walking between rows, and gliding her 
fingers over the spines. She stopped when she arrived at a misplaced 
book and pulled it from the self. Opening the small paperback she 
began to whisper the contents to herself as she continued her stroll. 

&quot;Poetry is food for the soul&quot;, a voice stated from one row over. 

&quot;Or poison&quot;, Dorothy replied. &quot;Most poets end up in rather pitiful 
states don&#39;t you think Trowa.&quot; 

She turned down the aisle the voice had come from, smiling politely 
when she greeted the young man with impossible hair. He shook his head 
as he took books from his cart and placed them in their proper spots.

&quot;Library closes soon&quot;, he whispered. 

&quot;I know.&quot; 

&quot;Waiting for someone?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; 

&quot;Enjoy the roses?&quot; He tilted his head slightly as he waited for a 
reply. 

Dorothy just grinned. 

&quot;She&#39;ll be late.&quot; 

&quot;Then I guess I shall wait.&quot; 

He looked rather disapproving, shaking his head as he continued to 
move down the aisle. She wanted to ask him why but knew better, 
preferring to continue her stroll, disposing of the book after a short 
while. 

She slowed her pace when she heard someone walking behind her, tilting 
her head so she could make out the person&#39;s shoes. Heels elegant, 
leather, and black padded along the carpeting. Dorothy stopped just as 
she reached the end of the aisle. Her ears perking at the tiny squeak 
from Trowa&#39;s cart five rows down. 

Stormy eyes shut as a hand touched her shoulder, a calm and cool voice 
whispering up her spine. 

&quot;I was afraid you&#39;d be busy&quot;, the woman&#39;s voice cooed. 

&quot;I was.&quot; Dorothy turned to face the woman. &quot;I heard you were going to 
be late.&quot; 

&quot;I was.&quot; 

She was a lady, through and through. Graceful, elegant, it was hard to 
remember she was a professor. Hard to remember anything about her 
except what was surface, shoulder length brown hair, hazelnut brown 
eyes and lips the palest of pink. And looking at her Dorothy often 
wondered how it was that such a lady would regard her as anything 
higher than a child. It was a silly bit of doubt that the lady didn&#39;t 
understand because the lady knew&#133; Dorothy was godly creature, high 
above the rest.

They were staring into each other&#39;s eyes so deeply an explosion could 
have gone off and they would not have heard. And beneath their rather 
calm expressions were a million words and emotions they dared not 
speak aloud. Confessions led to heartache and both understood the 
weight of that sentiment. 

&quot;Are you tired of this yet&quot;, the lady asked brushing a strand of 
blonde hair from Dorothy&#39;s face. 

&quot;Don&#39;t ask questions I don&#39;t know how to answer.&quot; 

The lady sighed, &quot;Me too. Let&#39;s to dinner and we can decide.&quot; 

*Funny ain&#39;t it 
Games people play 
Scratch it, paint it 
One and the same* 

Dinner was lonely despite the company. Silence touched glances that 
whispered and back again. Till there was so much left unsaid that both 
the lady and Dorothy wanted to cry. Of course neither did. They were 
too stubborn for that.

&quot;Do you think-&quot; 

&quot;No&quot;, the lady interrupted. &quot;But then&#133;&quot; 

&quot;Une, tell me I&#39;m a foolish child and that I should find someone my 
own age&quot;, Dorothy whispered. 

Une shut her eyes, &quot;You&#146;re a foolish child&#133;&quot; Her eyes opened, brown 
capturing the blue across from her. &quot;But you shouldn&#39;t find anyone 
your age.&quot;

&quot;No?&quot; 

&quot;Never.&quot; 

They were in Une&#39;s apartment. A docile and simple place decorated with 
a few antiques, and many bookcases. The lights were dim a few candles 
lit casting shadows on the wall, reflecting within the irises of the 
two women who sat neatly at the dining table. The silverware was 
polished, and their plates were mostly untouched. Wine glasses sat 
full and napkins neatly pressed. There was something playing on the 
stereo but the sound was so light it could barely be heard. 

Dorothy inched her chair back, standing and then moving over to the 
other side of the table. It felt like such a mistake to prolong 
something so secret. Secret not because she was a student seeing a 
professor, that was common enough. No it was secret because of 
indecision. She and the lady just couldn&#39;t feel the gravity of what 
they were getting into. Meeting over coffee, finding similarities and 
playing a game that was ready to end. 

Une curved her arm around Dorothy&#39;s waist, her fingers tickled by the 
blonde&#39;s long hair. She pulled the goddess close, resting her head on 
the young woman&#39;s chest. And Dorothy moved her hands threw Une&#39;s hair, 
finally drawing her gaze up. To look and see those unmentioned things 
that were easy to deny in silence, but hard to forget once seen.

&quot;What are we doing&quot;, Dorothy asked. 

&quot;I&#39;ve know idea.&quot; 

&quot;Then let&#39;s stop. Let&#39;s do something different.&quot; 

&quot;For example.&quot; 

The blonde grinned, wolfish and kind, &quot;Come watch me perform and after 
that&#133;&quot; 

&quot;After that?&quot; 

&quot;You can treat me to a fancy dinner.&quot; 

The lady returned the grin, &quot;And Nichol?&quot; 

&quot;Can buy dessert. But let&#39;s not worry over him shall we?&quot; 

&quot;Of course.&quot; 

Une stood, and then gently leant down to claim lips that had been 
waiting. 

And there are moments 
That break in stillness 
Take to the last 
And give the most 
Beneath the sky 
And the dream of a kiss 
I have no words left 
To describe this 
Shall I close and say I love 
Or I want 
And need forever 
No I think I will quiet my thoughts 
So I can hear in this touch 
What words and voice 
Make too rough 

The bouquet hung limply in his hand as he leaned in the small hallway 
leading to the dressing rooms. The sound of high heels clicking toward 
him made him look over. He wasn&#39;t sure how he wanted to greet the 
lady, so he grimaced. The professor stood next to him in the hallway 
her eyes on the floor, right hand holding a single rose, redder than 
the curtain and the carpet of the theater. A noise escaped his throat 
that sounded similar to a chuckle.

&quot;You think I&#39;m pretentious&quot;, Une stated. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know what I think.&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;ll like those&#133;&quot; She motioned to his bouquet; &quot;Are they lilies?&quot; 

&quot;And violets.&quot; He squinted, his eyes taking in the lady&#39;s posture. 
&quot;You think she&#39;ll be famous some day?&quot; 

&quot;No. I think she prefers the background.&quot; 

&quot;Like you?&quot; 

&quot;No, like you.&quot; She checked her watch. &quot;You don&#39;t trust me do you?&quot; 

&quot;It isn&#39;t a question of trusting you Une.&quot; 

&quot;Oh?&quot; 

&quot;It is a question of happiness.&quot; 

&quot;Who&#39;s exactly?&quot; 

He huffed crossing his arms without damaging the flowers. &quot;Maybe 
yours.&quot; 

The lady grinned, &quot;Not hers? I would have thought&#133;but then I guess I 
wouldn&#39;t have been right.&quot; 

&quot;No.&quot; 

&quot;So you aren&#39;t going to warn me about her?&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s my friend there&#39;s nothing to say.&quot; 

A sigh left her lips, &quot;You&#39;re a sweet boy Nichol&#133; letting us both go 
so easily.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t hurt each other.&quot; 

&quot;I can&#39;t promise that and neither can she.&quot; 

&quot;Right.&quot; 

His ears perked as one of the dressing room doors opened both he and 
Une looking over to see Dorothy sauntering their way. She looked them 
over, noting the flowers and their intriguing expressions.

&quot;I do hope you two aren&#39;t fighting over me&quot;, Dorothy said just before 
reaching over and welcoming Une with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. 

&quot;I would never fight for you Dotty&quot;; Nichol chimed in. &quot;I&#39;d ruin my 
suit.&quot; 

&quot;So vain Nicky&quot;, Dorothy shot back, taking the time to pat his cheek. 
&quot;I would think a little damage would do that outfit some good.&quot;

&quot;Yes well what exactly do you call that thing you did in the third 
act?&quot; 

&quot;Acting darling. Something you should be very familiar with the way 
you run around these days.&quot; 

Une shook her head; &quot;I&#39;m I going to have to separate you two?&quot; 

Nichol scoffed. 

Dorothy chuckled. 

And Une grinned. 

Once upon a time 
And far away today 
I saw the sun rising 
In a perfect quiet way 
Reminded me of meeting 
Of playing in the sand 
Took me back to the times 
When we walked hand in hand
