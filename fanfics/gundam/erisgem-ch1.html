<pre>* Born of anger and despair 
Who will strangle me 
Who will untangle my hair*

The faucet squeaked on and the pipes rumbled before a steady stream of 
water emerged. Her small hands cupped the chilled liquid and then 
quickly she splashed it onto her face. Droplets fell from her pale 
face onto the collar of her jacket as she stared blankly at her 
reflection. Dark blue eyes looking back at her observing all the 
noticeable flaws, making her feel ugly beneath the shallow florescent 
lights of the restroom. 

She tilted her head to view her profile, a graceless hand tracing her 
jaw line. She was positively retched, unforgivably thin, and she felt 
like the walking dead. But no one saw that really. Everyone still 
observed her as what she was before her duties kept her from such 
simple pleasures as sleep and a good meal. Her deterioration was 
hardly purposeful, though a very select group would argue otherwise.

She blinked. The lights, the lights made her look worse than she was, 
but she understood the message her failing reflection was sending. And 
she was bound and determined to take it to heart. 

A sigh escaped her and she leaned forward on the sink. Two more days 
and she would be free of everything she was. Two more days and she 
would just be Relena Peacecraft Darlain, rich girl. Then she could 
kill Vice Minister Relena, Ambassador Relena, Dignitary Relena, and 
Princess and Queen Relena all in one blow. Ten years of effort would 
show its worth and she could lay the ghosts of her fathers to rest. 

She shut her eyes, taking a deep breath, and then buttoned her jacket, 
her pristine white and gold embroidered uniform that reflected her 
status. Honey blonde hair respectfully pulled back into a ponytail 
with an aristocratic black velvet bow, she found herself smirking at 
how oddly appropriate it was for her to leave the political stage 
wearing the very costume she had worn for her entrance. That life long 
ago when she had been a princess.

Relena dusted the shoulders and lapels of her jacket before turning 
and exiting the restroom. Charging back into the hell of the Grand 
Conference to find her end.

**Out of her mouth she comes in rages 
Like Vesuvius in heat 
She runs ahead of her intentions 
Though she&#146;s programmed for defeat**

The Grand Conference was the last stage in a ten-year effort to bring 
Earth and the colonies to a &quot;perfect peace&quot;. Within the walls of the 
last nine conferences laws and policies had been written, torn apart, 
rebuilt, approved and denied countless times over. It was a month long 
meeting of the heads of all nations and the colonies to come to their 
final agreements and sign a universal treaty that would lie in affect 
for over one hundred years. 

Relena was slouching into her chair as for the millionth time some 
ambassador from one of the outer colonies unleashed a rampaging speech 
of disagreement to a policy that had been agreed upon three years 
earlier. She listened to the booming banter from those that did not 
approve of his outburst and those who agreed, and those whom were 
interjecting with statements that had nothing to do with anything 
being discussed. After a minute or so she sat back up gathering all 
her documents and belongs, and shoved them into her leather briefcase. 

The room suddenly fell silent as she stood from her place at the head 
of the conference.

&quot;Vice Minister Darlain&quot;, a hefty voice said almost apologetically. 
&quot;Where are you going?&quot;

Relena hunched over her little space, sniffed and spoke into the 
microphone to address the question, &quot;I&#39;m retiring to my room 
Ambassador.&quot; Her eyes wandered over the baffled faces that met her. 
&quot;And before it is questioned let me state very clearly for the record 
of this conference that I am here to preside over and sign the final 
universal treaty. From the level of bickering amongst the other 
dignitaries it is plainly obvious that the past ten years and nine 
other conferences have meant nothing.&quot; She stood up straight, a softly 
stern expression on her worn face, hidden by her knack for claiming 
attention. &quot;There are two days left to this Grand Conference ladies 
and gentlemen. Two days and I am greatly discouraged by the actions 
presented to me here. If you are not prepared to agree on a single 
policy or law then I suggest we end this conference now and extend 
this plan for two more years&quot;, she paused to take in the awe with 
which she was being watched. &quot;Of course in that time I hope everyone 
is prepared to face the consequences of what waiting will do to our 
nations and colonies. The longer we fight ladies and gentleman the 
more time outside groups have to insight rebellion and destroy the 
peace we have all worked so hard to secure.&quot;

She sighed regretfully and turned to walk out of the room. And as she 
did a slow and steady applause built behind her. It rumbled in her 
chest and forced her to face the crowd again. She raised her hands 
calming the crowd.

&quot;I admire the applause but such things are meaningless unless they are 
meant.&quot; She swallowed and concluded with, &quot;As moderator I am 
concluding today&#39;s proceedings. In the morning if you have not found a 
way to agree then I will have no choice but to cancel proceedings and 
extend this conference out another year. I hope&#133; it will not come to 
that.&quot; 

Relena Peacecraft Darlain made her exit then. Brushing past the praise 
taking the stairs down to meet her car. She wondered if those she knew 
at the conference were clapping as well. Was her lost pilot in the 
crowd admiring her resolve? Was her lost lover smirking devilishly 
waiting feverishly for the moment she could confront Relena about her 
speech? Where the others watching the event even now as it was 
replayed on the news? Would her words cause any of them to clamor to 
remove her from power she no longer wanted?

Most of the questions would be answered with a no, and the one 
question that would be answered with a yes she didn&#39;t deserve any 
longer. Love affairs like politics she managed to ruin in pretty 
colors and false promises. Her fist clenched the handle to her 
briefcase tightly; turning her knuckles white as she moved through the 
building and crowds of people to a secret exit that led to her car. 

Relena shoved the door open to greet her driver and Preventor escort 
with a grimace. Her escort held the door open for her and she fell 
into the plush leather interior like a sinking ship. She wanted to 
close her eyes, but managed to stay awake for the drive over to her 
hotel to take some calls and answer questions from a few extremely 
over apologetic world leaders, and snack on some crackers. Her young 
Preventor escort watched her with distinguished awe. Another soldier 
lost to the false charm and poise of her presence. 

**By the hunger and the hatred 
The prostitution of her nature 
She has given and forgiven** 

The hotel was thankfully void of reporters, but then the Preventor 
agency had a near perfect record for keeping secrets from the press. 
Relena ended her last call as she stepped out of the car. Nodding her 
thanks to the driver she brushed a few misplaced strands of hair from 
her face and began the slow saunter into the hotel lobby. The escort 
followed her obediently until she reached the elevator to her suite at 
which point another officer took over the duty.

By the time she reached her suite near the top of the hotel Relena was 
ready to slip into a coma and never wake. It had been a long and 
tedious day, with nothing to show but how impossible politicians were 
and always would be. Nothing was going to change. It hardly mattered 
to her any longer but it would matter to many when she retired from 
her position as Vice Foreign Minister. She allowed herself to become 
vaguely concerned about what would happen when she stepped down as the 
poster girl for peace.

The elevator hopped slightly as the doors opened. Yet another young 
Preventor greeting her and unlocking her suite. Security was extremely 
tight around her at all times and not at her request. It was the other 
world leaders that feared for her safety, as if peace could not be 
achieved if Relena Peacecraft Darlain were taken out by a bullet. The 
rather horrid thought that absolute peace might be achieved by her 
assassination flitted over her mind making her smile. The old call in 
her heart for something dark waking briefly before the demand for 
sleep shook her from her revelry.

There were no guards in her room. For that she was more than grateful. 
The door shut behind her and Relena quickly took herself to the 
bedroom, only bothering to remove her jacket before sliding into the 
bed, briefcase thrown to the side without care.

As her eyes shut she wished. And knowing her wish wouldn&#39;t come true; 
sleep claimed her and sent her dreams that were purposely cruel. 
Reminders of the things she lived through, the things that had 
promised and never delivered. 

***I&#146;m tired of waking up 
I&#146;m sick of rolling off the bus 
I want to sleep forever 
In the lies I&#146;ve made***

She woke at nine in the evening to the sound of someone rapping at her 
bedroom door. She hoped it wasn&#39;t an overly panicked guard as she 
groggily stepped over to the bedroom door and slid it open a few 
inches. It wasn&#39;t a guard but it was a Preventor, the icy and stolid 
queen of protection Lady Une. 

Relena bit back her want to curse, switched on the light and opened 
the door fully. She was certain she looked impressive with her hair 
tangled around her shoulders, blue eyes angry from waking and slightly 
crusted with sleep. 

The lady of course waited patiently for Relena to gather her senses, a 
bare smile on her pink lips as she stood. 

Relena and Lady Une were hardly ever in the same room together. It was 
not a point of coincidence but one of deep and scalding resentment, 
bad blood that neither found the time to resolve. Even after the 
incident with Mariemea the two did not see eye to eye. And Relena was 
aware that most, if not all the uncomfortable spaces surrounding her 
and Une were a direct result of her own inability to forgive. Worse 
was the knowledge that the lady fully accepted the blame that Relena 
presented. Worse and cutting the ex-princess with every moment she was 
near the Preventor was the knowledge that Une fully expected to be 
treated poorly. It was very hard to hate a woman who had and still 
atoned for her past sins. 

More alert she shot the lady a questioning glance, not knowing how to 
take the polite nod that followed.

&quot;One of the colonies leaders has planned a small party. I was asked to 
see if you would attend&quot;, Une stated crisply. 

&quot;Why were you asked? It doesn&#39;t seem fitting someone of your rank.&quot;

&quot;Maybe not, but Mr. Winner was adamant that I ask you personally.&quot;

Relena felt a chuckle lingering her throat but swallowed it down; 
&quot;It&#39;s very nice of Quatre to think of me, but no. I&#39;ve nothing to wear 
and besides&#133; I am very behind on my work.&quot;

&quot;And sleep&quot;, the lady added gently. 

Blue eyes narrowed with bordered anger. And hazelnut brown eyes merely 
met the disdain with calm resolve.

&quot;I will let Mr. Winner know you not be attending&quot;, Une stated turning 
to leave.

Relena would have loved to blame her fatigue for what she said next 
but knew she couldn&#39;t. The lady stopped dead in her tracks, and then 
she found the momentum to face the ex-princess.

&quot;What was that?&quot;

The blonde winced. &quot;I know you heard me&quot;, she whispered softly. &quot;And I 
haven&#39;t an excuse for that sort of language.&quot;

An eyebrow perked as the lady stepped further into the room. &quot;And you 
aren&#39;t apologizing either.&quot; 

Une tucked her shoulder length brown hair behind her left ear. It was 
a nervous gesture that caught Relena off guard.

The lady cleared her throat before softly mentioning, &quot;I think we need 
to talk.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve nothing to say.&quot;

&quot;But you do&quot;, Une replied swiftly, gently. &quot;You&#39;ve plenty or was that 
little bite all?&quot; She shut her eyes briefly. &quot;How would you see me 
punished for the past Ms. Darlain?&quot;

She didn&#39;t have an answer, just a dreadful feeling in the pit of her 
stomach. 

**A silent woman parts her lips
To speak before she ought
She makes a cross of her emotions
And panic of her thoughts**

Relena hated the quiet. It was always a prelude something dark and of 
her own doing. Perverted and twisted wants constantly battling her 
heart and she was at a loss at how sate them. Because her hate for the 
lady was not formed of so simple a thing as her father&#39;s 
assassination, nor of how his death laid the course to ruin her boring 
life as a rebellious teenager. No the lady was everything Relena could 
want in an enemy and everything she wanted and convinced herself she 
needed in a lover. 

And it was true those she loved most dearly, and took to her bed were 
either fickle reminders of the innocence she had once been, or cold to 
the touch. In her most long-term relationship her lover was bitingly 
cruel with an instinct for the type of battles Relena was never 
allowed to admit she understood. The type of person the ex-princess 
could never hope to hide from, but ultimately just another person who 
could not fulfill her need to be cut up and hallowed out like the 
porcelain doll she thought herself. 

Yes, just a ragged piece of flesh used to site the evils of the world. 
An angelic face to inspire soldiers and create wars for peace. Such a 
terribly sad doll easily propped up and moved around&#133;And now that she 
was older&#133;Now that she was fully in control of everything she said and 
did, the strides she made towards ultimate peace felt bizarrely 
crushing. 

She sat on the corner of her bed still too tired to keep her noble 
stance. Une stood patiently a constant reminder of what she never had, 
closure, and&#133; redemption. The lady was still paying for her past, but 
Relena&#133; Her eyes shut as she fought back her tears. She wished she 
wasn&#39;t so tired. It would have been easier to hide. 

The ex-princess hated Une for everything she could not forgive of 
herself. She had committed sins as well. She had done things she 
should not have. Things that cost people their lives and never once 
had she been asked to atone. No she was billed a hero just as the 
pilots were, the generals, and rebels. 

Relena looked over at Une and could see the older woman preparing to 
speak. She couldn&#39;t allow it.

&quot;Don&#39;t you see&quot;, She began the soft sparks in her tone reaching new 
levels of diplomacy and righteousness though she never strived for it. 
&quot;Despite what I just said, it is not about how I would have you 
punished.&quot;

The lady&#39;s eyes were wide with momentary shock, but quickly eased back 
to soft understanding. &quot;When this conference through Ms. Darlain&#133; I 
would like to discuss this matter further.&quot;

She could hardly believe her ears. Une was letting her off the hook.

The preventor nodded quickly on her way out of the suite to deliver 
the rejected invitation. Leaving Relena with little but the chance to 
gather her thoughts. With a deep breath the Vice Foreign Minister 
Relena Peacecraft Darlain made way to her desk. She had not been lying 
when she mentioned she had work to do. Another listless evening began 
as she hunched over paperwork and survived deadening phone calls. Half 
way through her tenth call the doorbell rang and a Preventor wheeled 
in something from the hotel kitchen. She wanted to understand the 
meaning of the gesture as she looked over the tray and the exquisite 
meal she had not ordered.

**She looks out of her window 
At the changes in the sky 
She never wants to leave her sanctuary 
Bedroom books and lies** 

The secluded conference room looked over the small bay the Grand 
Conference was located near. Relena watched, as dusk swept across a 
pale blue sky, secretly wishing she could be in a red convertible 
racing across the orange rust colored bridge the locals called 
&#39;golden&#39;. 

It was a small room big enough for exactly six people. She was 
currently alone but it wasn&#39;t to last. As her tired blue eyes focused 
on the beat of the water rolling and tossing in the bay, ships caught 
on the choppy waves, the door opened behind her and a few people 
filtered in.

&quot;The documents are all prepared and ready Vice Foreign Minister 
Darlain&quot;, A voice boomed. &quot;Shall we proceed?&quot;

She turned to face the men who had entered the room, glancing briefly 
at the eloquently scripted universal treaty sitting on the table. She 
smiled grimily and sat down, the others followed suit. Her blue eyes 
flitted over the document, siting signatures and approvals from all 
the colonies and nations represented at the conference. It was done. 

She felt the other&#39;s watching her, and obliged to comfort them she 
grinned. Taking a pen in her hand to set the treaty in motion 
officially, just as she would do publicly in a few hours.

&quot;I&#39;m happy everyone finally agreed&quot;, she muttered racing her pen 
across the paper and sealing the deal.

Everyone in the room clapped. 

She felt&#133;ill. 

&quot;Hope you are prepared for this in a few more hours&quot;, one of the 
plumper dignitaries rang happily.

&quot;I am.&quot; 

&quot;And will you be accepting the nomination&quot;, he asked.

Relena was confused, &quot;What nomination?&quot;

&quot;To be the head of council for the Universal Nations?&quot;

Her stomach flipped. She cleared her throat and scratchily replied, 
&quot;No, I will not be accepting.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; The man sounded oddly disappointed.

The others rumbled their disappointment as they exited the room. 
Relena watched them go, sitting in the numbed shock of what had been 
said. Swallowed hard and then noticed she was not alone in the room.

Her eyes meet those of the lady with slight shock but then her 
expression washed to untouched and she slouched into her seat.

&quot;They don&#39;t know do they&quot;, the lady asked in her usual polite and 
exact tone.

&quot;No they don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;When will they know?&quot;

&quot;After the public treaty has been signed and I&#39;ve completed my task.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; 

The lady was seconds from the door but Relena caught her.

&quot;Une&#133; We can&#133;We can talk this evening if you are available.&quot;

&quot;Of course. By the way&quot;, she called over her shoulder exiting the 
room, &quot;Just because you are retiring does not mean you can go 
unescorted.&quot;

Relena shut her eyes, &quot;I know&#133; I know&#133;&quot;

The conference ended as she expected it to. All applause and 
discouragement from the masses as she announced her retirement. Safe 
in her suite she refused all calls but one, ignoring the desperate 
pleas of those that wanted to see her bound to her role and duties 
forever. Tired and weak she wondered why she had agreed to meet with 
Une that evening. And then she found the answer and she hated herself 
even more.

** Out of her passion breaks the stillness 
Of a solitary mind 
A strict devotion to the rhythm 
With a substitute for time**

Her dark blue eyes watched the flash of the red light on her hotel 
phone and her ears twitched at the small beep from her personal phone. 
The flash and the beep sight and sound reminders of what she did not 
wish to face. Reporters and politicians chomping at the bit to hear 
directly from her own lips why she was retiring and Relena knew if she 
answered them as they called, her bitter and mocking tone would not be 
easily or lightly taken. 

She wanted to scoff at the few old men that were her colleagues who 
said she was too young to retire. She wanted to be cruel and make 
remarks no one thought her capable of. Remind those old men of her age 
and the childhood she lost&#133; the childhood she allowed to be ripped 
from her. 

Relena sank into her chair and moved her focus to the night sky and 
the barely visible stars. Her mind refused to be still, filling her 
with too many things that begged for attention. A primary thought 
being Une and another being someone she missed only when she was 
acting too reflective&#133;Dorothy Catalonia. The ex-princess tried to 
imagine what Dorothy would say if the blonde goddess were actually 
still on speaking terms with her. Her jaw clenched. 

Of all the things she&#39;d ever destroyed it was her affair with Dorothy 
she regretted the most. Relena would never say it was love, even 
though that was what she cried when Dorothy left. It was never love; 
it was always just a dark side of lust. A self imposed punishment that 
turned on her, because what began as Dorothy putting Relena in her 
place became Relena torturing the goddess with the weight of her soul. 

She missed the fights that they had the conflict that wound from the 
political arena into the bedroom. All the things Relena could never 
say were present in Dorothy&#39;s very being. It was gone though. She 
broke it drowning in her need for something darker, always something 
darker. And there was a rhythm to that darkness, an echo that pointed 
in one direction. Even if that direction was no longer blacker than 
pitch but growing into colors like the dawn. 

From behind she heard the door click open and she did not turn to see 
who it was. She already knew. 

&quot;Are you happier now&quot;, the voice of a lady wrapped up Relena&#39;s spine, 
making beautiful her more base and hated emotions.

Relena didn&#39;t move but she sighed as she answered, &quot;Wait a few days 
I&#39;ll let you know.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps we should not talk tonight.&quot;

&quot;No time like the present to wipe away the bad blood&quot;, her breath felt 
uneven. 

&quot;I never expect you to forgive me.&quot;

&quot;I know and now I won&#39;t be a politician so there isn&#39;t a reason for me 
to pretend to be civil to you.&quot; 

Relena could feel Une moving closer, and so the ex-princess stood up 
and stepped away to the cool of the window. Her nervous breathing 
fogging the glass, stretching the colors of the lights outside.

&quot;Do you know what you did when you followed your orders to kill my 
father&quot;, Relena stated just when she was sure Une was close enough too 
touch. Just when she was sure she could step back and into the lady&#39;s 
arms. &quot;You unleashed the monster that is Relena Peacecraft Darlain.&quot;

&quot;Are you a monster? I thought you were a great leader, the world 
thinks-&quot;

&quot;The world is blind!&quot; She turned quickly. Eye to eye with the woman 
she had once wanted to kill, ruin and make suffer. &quot;The world does not 
see anything I am.&quot; 

&quot;No you are right. The world knows nothing about you&quot;, Une replied 
back softly. &quot;Would you really want the world to know who Relena 
Darlain really is? They&#39;d crucify you if they knew.&quot; A cold 
realization rested on Une&#39;s shoulders, hazelnut colored eyes wide with 
shock, voice still lost in an eerie calm, &quot;But you always wanted that 
didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Perceptive.&quot; Her tone bit. Blue eyes avoiding the penetrating glare 
from the lady.

&quot;And so being responsible for unleashing you upon the world should I 
be the one to recapture you?&quot;

&quot;What would be the point? I&#39;m finished. I&#39;ve bowed out and I&#39;m done.&quot;

Relena wasn&#39;t sure what was going to happen. Things were far too raw 
between her and the lady. The air was heavy around her, darker sides 
tugging at her as she continued to avoid the lady&#39;s eyes. If she 
looked again into those brown eyes she was afraid of what she would 
fall into. Consequences playing in her mind but never taking hold. All 
she knew, all she could feel was the weight of the air and what was 
her vile want, a pulse of expectation.

**Help me
Help me
Help me 
Breathe**

There was a pull in the air that was rather indescribable, one of 
hate, one of heat, something of want, of lust building within Relena&#39;s 
chest. It suffocated her reason, and killed her chances to hide. 
Vulnerable beneath the lady&#39;s glare the ex-princess wondered if Une 
knew exactly what she was trying to deny.

&quot;Maybe you should sleep&quot;, the lady finally said. &quot;You look tired.&quot;

It was Une&#39;s reserved calm that goaded Relena the most. She assumed it 
was a skill built from years in the military, but then&#133;perhaps it was 
experience that kept the lady from revealing all her intentions. 

&quot;I&#39;ve been tired for years&#133; But I&#39;m not sure I can ever rest.&quot;

&quot;Still waiting for something&quot;, Une asked. &quot;Something you can&#39;t let go 
of but aren&#39;t sure you want to taste?&quot;

She shook her head, blue eyes slowly rising to greet Une&#39;s. &quot;No, I 
know what I want.&quot;

&quot;Then what stops you from taking it?&quot;

&quot;Maybe it wouldn&#39;t be right.&quot;

&quot;Maybe&#133; maybe you&#39;re relying too much on opinions that do not exist at 
the moment?&quot;

Looking into the lady&#39;s eyes there was a spark she had only ever felt 
once in her life. It was one of those telling moments when it was 
clear someone knew her&#133;everything about her and didn&#39;t care. Saw the 
darkness, the rage, the hurt little girl who never got her revenge, 
who was never punished for her petty sins, and the destruction she had 
hoped to bury. She wanted to know how it was possible and why&#133;Why it 
was always the ones that started as enemies that held the power to do 
so.

The air around them was stale and stagnant; the kind of silence Relena 
hated taking over to prove a point. After what felt like too long 
being read and dissected the ex-princess took a step forward and the 
lady met her. Her uncertain mind lost hold and emotion took control. 
Heavy with a heart undone by the devastating beat of war Relena found 
the lady&#39;s lips willing to accept her advances. Willing to return what 
she could and the diplomat wasn&#39;t sure there was a word for it. 

They stood there near the window fogged over with cold condensation, 
lost in the dark, still in a rhythm their tongues had decided. Every 
second more intensely bruising until at last the lady broke the kiss, 
her arms wound tightly about Relena&#39;s waist.

&quot;I can&#39;t promise to destroy you with my lips Relena. I can&#39;t promise 
to punish you thus&quot;, Une whispered almost hoarsely. &quot;Even if you&#39;re 
punishing me as well.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t need your promise lady&#133; all I need is a night&#133; a week&#133;&quot;

&quot;A night&quot;, the lady replied as her lips made way to crash upon those 
below her. &quot;Just a night.&quot;

**Though the truth is less unclear now 
They have won a thousand battles 
They have wrung their own demise** 

The bedroom walls echoed their passion as they fell to the bed. With 
each touch and caress a new torment was revealed And it was the young 
woman who had been a princess, a queen, a diplomat and who still was a 
lonely child that cried the most. Tears falling from her eyes because 
the lady was so brutally gentle, so unsparingly kind the way she 
kissed, the way she took but did not rob. Tears falling because she 
knew her own lips punished, and ripped, but her revenge, the hurt she 
caused was forgiven again and again. 

Finally quiet in each other&#39;s arms Relena could reflect on what she 
had done. She should have been happy. She finally had what she wanted. 
She was free from her duty, she had claimed her revenge, and her heart 
was a slow dying ember. The lightest weight would destroy her. But the 
warmth felt in the softness of the lady&#39;s touch squashed any happiness 
that was derived from receiving her wishes. 

Her eyes shut tight as Une held her closer. The whisper of the lady&#39;s 
breath upon her neck lulling her to sleep and the fear that one night 
would be just that. 

**Generations like the water 
Shape the face of every stone 
A pedigree&#146;s an invitation 
To discover you&#146;re alone**

Relena kept herself from crying when she woke alone. Packed her things 
quickly and made a few phone calls as she waited for the bellhops and 
her escorts to gather her things and secure the area for her 
departure. She released a prepared statement to the press regarding 
her retirement as well. It would not quiet any rumors, or defeat the 
continuing questions but it would at least calm the waters of the 
paparazzi for a moment or two.

A call came up stating that her car was ready. She sniffed hiding her 
eyes from the world behind a pair of sunglasses with green lenses. 
Picked up her briefcase and followed her escort to the parking garage. 

Concrete and cold she waited patiently as her car pulled around, 
looking over the marked parking spaces with some amusement. She was 
standing between D11 and 1H it was an curious way to mark spots and 
she shook her head as she realized she was focusing on the frivolous 
to avoid what she felt inside. And inside she was an emotional 
maelstrom.

Her escort held the door to her car open and she blindly fell in. When 
she was finally home she considered trading her limo for something a 
little sporty, maybe a nice little red convertible. The car began to 
move and she was too busy watching the buildings roll past to 
acknowledge her new escort. Hardly startled when she brought her 
attention around and met with hazelnut brown eyes.

&quot;You said one night&quot;; Relena whispered removing her sunglasses.

&quot;I did.&quot;

&quot;Then why-&quot;

&quot;Because you still need an escort.&quot; The lady replied and then added, 
&quot;Besides I&#39;ve been known to change my mind.&quot;

&quot;Concerning?&quot;

&quot;Princesses who became monsters.&quot;

&quot;Ah.&quot;

&quot;And the revenge they never received for shooting roses off the lapels 
of graceless ladies.&quot;

Blue eyes shut and she slouched into her seat. She wanted to grin but 
found it hard to do as the lady slid closer to her. Relena fell a 
sleep safe in the embrace of what she loved&#133;the very heart of discord.
