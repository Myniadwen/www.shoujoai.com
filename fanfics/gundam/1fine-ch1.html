<h1>One Fine Day</h1>

<pre>Relena opened her arms as an offering, only to receive a petty sneer. 
She frowned, and her eyes questioned why.

Heero Yuy turned his back on the young politician and walked away, 
once again. Relena let her arms fall, and murmured a few words, with 
very deep meanings.

&quot;One fine day Heero, one fucking fine day.&quot;

One fine day 
You&#39;ll look at me
And you will know our love was 
Meant to be
One fine day 
You&#39;re gonna want me for your girl

Relena crashed on her bed, sighing. She pulled back her pillow, took 
out a stamp, and stamped a picture next to about fifty others. It was 
of a chibi boy with Prussian eyes and unruly brown hair, and next to 
him words read mission failed. Bluntness at its best. She would stamp 
one of these pictures on the wall every time Heero left her. No 
mission accomplished yet though. Relena put her pillow over the 
pictures and set the stamps back in the nightstand drawer. Suddenly a 
knock came from the door, and she gave a low, &quot;come in&#39;&#39;.

Hilde came in, tears streaming down her face, and Relena opened her 
arms-to someone who would actually except the offering. Hilde ran into 
them, embracing the blonde, sobbing pitifully. 

&quot;What happened?&quot; Relena sighed, rubbing soothing circles in the German 
girl&#39;s back.

&quot;H-he said he would NEVER love m-me, an-and he would never be able to 
get that close to me, and then he, he asked if I could cook him 
HOTDOGS!!!!&quot;the girl broke down, and Relena tightened her grip.

&quot;It&#39;s okay...Hilde it&#39;s okay....&quot;

The blonde tried to think of a way to make her best friend feel 
better. A light bulb suddenly clicked on in her head.

&quot;Hilde?&quot;

&quot;H-hai?&quot; the blue haired girl replied, wiping her nose on the 
politicians pajamas, and Relena winced. Two pajama shirts down, this 
was going to be a bad habit. Forcing a smile, she said, &quot;I have a 
plan.&quot;

The arms I long for 

Will open wide
And you&#39;ll be proud to have me 
By your side
One fine day 
You&#39;re gonna want me for your girl

*****************************

&quot;AC 200&#39;s Preventer Ball!&quot; a reporter chirped, walking into the 
ballroom, which was decorated with special care, banners hung around 
the room, a singer preparing the orchestra for some waltzes. 

Duo and Heero sat together, Duo providing a one-sided conversation for 
the two. 

Quatre and Trowa were at the buffet table, Quatre trying to feed his 
koi some food with his hand, while the uni-banged boy gave a small 
blush. 

Wufei was chasing Sally around the room, screaming Chinese curses as 
she threatened to press the self destruct button for Nataku. 

&quot;Say it!&quot;

&quot;NO!&quot;

&quot;SAY IT!&quot;

&quot;ONNA!&quot;

&quot;WUFEI!&quot;

The Chinese boy sighed on defeat, and quietly mumbled some words.

&quot;Nani?&quot; Sally smirked, and Wufei rolled his eyes.

&quot;Sally the queen of combat boots, strongest of onnas, the most 
beautiful woman ever, best damn commander I ever laid eyes on, whom I 
should listen to as if she were my mother, PLEASE give me back the 
self destruct button so I won&#39;t have to cry. There, happy onna?&quot; Wufei 
snarled, glaring. Sally pressed the red button, and the boy yelped. 
The button popped, and confetti flew around them, plus a banner that 
read &#39;Weakling&#39; on it. The raven haired pilot went an interesting 
shade of green, and went for Sally&#39;s neck. 

The strawberry-blonde woman laughed and ran off, a tape recorder in 
hand, with Wufei in hot pursuit. 

******************************

&quot;I don&#39;t know Relena,&quot; Hilde said, looking at herself in the mirror. A 
girl looked back at her clad in a midnight blue dress that clung to 
her tightly, and had no straps. It had a princess cut, and was not 
what she was used to. A diamond necklace adorned her neck, and 
sparkled when held in the light. She had on matching midnight blue 
heels, which were an inch high, and strapped across and behind her 
foot. Minimal makeup was worn, and brought out her blue eyes. 

Hilde looked back at Relena, and gaped. 

Clad in an also strapless dress, that started out a silvery gray and 
faded into black when it reached the floor, Relena looked stunning. 
The dress clung to her chest tightly, but flared out at the hips, 
flowing down like a waterfall to the floor. She had on, though no one 
could see, a pair of sneakers, since her feet were still hurting from 
running after Heero in heels. She had on opera gloves, which were 
pitch black, and a small tiara-like headdress made of diamonds. Her 
sandy blonde hair fell in soft curls, and Hilde couldn&#39;t help but feel 
like drooling.

Noticing how she was acting, Hilde blushed and turned around.

&#39;Great baka. Scare away your only friend.&#39;

But she couldn&#39;t help it. Hilde had always loved Duo, even though he 
never gave her more than a friendly pat on the shoulder for a job well 
done. With Relena, something more....deep ran through her heart, and 
tonight she could test the two out to see who held onto her heart more 
tightly. 

&quot;Ready?&quot; Relena asked, smiling. Hilde nodded nervously, but took 
Relena&#39;s offered hand. 

*********************

Heero sat by himself, thinking about the last events that had 
occurred. Relena......what did he feel for the stalking politician? 
Hate? No....Fear? He snickered at that one. Love? Yeah right. But was 
he taking her for granted? Would she one day give up on him and go out 
with someone else? He couldn&#39;t help but snicker at that one too.

&#39;Relena? Someone else?&#39; Snicker. But Heero felt a pang in his heart at 
the idea. That couldn&#39;t happen...could it?

When the young blonde entered the room, he felt as if he would fall 
out of his chair when he saw she wasn&#39;t alone.

***************************

There went the muffin Duo had been eating. Was that...Hilde? In 
a.....dress? A tight fitting dress? He rubbed his eyes, his jaw 
falling open even more. And she was with....RELENA?! That was it. Duo 
didn&#39;t really have those kind of feelings for the german girl...but 
that didn&#39;t mean she could go out with someone else! Much less a girl! 

******************************

&quot;Hilde?&quot; Relena squeezed her hand, and Hilde jumped. 

&quot;Hai?&quot;

&quot;Dance?&quot;Relena wiggled her eyebrows, and Hilde giggled.

&quot;I&#39;d love to koi!&quot; she said, louder than required. Averting her eyes, 
she saw Duo&#39;s violet eyes practically popping out. 

The two strolled out to the dance floor, and began a waltz. 

&quot;I wonder,&quot; Hilde murmured to her &#39;koi&#39;, &quot;do you think Duo is the kind 
of boy who runs around...and didn&#39;t want to waste time with me?&quot;

&quot;No babe, Heero runs around,&quot; Relena snickered,&quot; But maybe this will 
teach them not to settle down with us.&quot;

When the blonde saw Hilde&#39;s eyes soften with a saddened look, she gave 
a soft,&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;I just...I don&#39;t know what to feel, who to love, oh God Relena what 
do I do?&quot; she cried softly, and Relena drew her closer, letting Hilde 
rest her head against her shoulder.

&quot;It&#39;s okay....just wait for him, someday he&#39;ll come around...&quot;

Though I know you&#39;re the 
Kind of boy
Who only wants to run around
I&#39;ll keep waiting and 
Someday darling
You&#39;ll come to me when you want to settle down

Duo and Heero stared in disbelief as the two girls danced around the 
floor to a steady waltz, holding each other QUITE closely. 

********************

&quot;Psst Dorothy!&quot; a voice whispered to Dorothy, and the girl turned to 
look at her koi.

&quot;Hai?&quot;

&quot;Look! Look!&quot; her date pointed to Hilde and Relena. Dorothy couldn&#39;t 
help the laugh that came, a real, genuine laugh, one she hadn&#39;t known 
until she had met her lover.

&quot;Well, well, well....&quot;she said, and when Relena glanced at her, the 
funky eyebrowed girl winked in approval. Relena mouthed &#39;hentai&#39; and 
Dorothy nodded, smirking. 

Relena giggled, and turned her attention back to her date.

Dorothy snickered.

&quot;What?&quot; her lover asked, looking at her curiously.

&quot;Nothing love, let&#39;s dance,&quot; Dorothy replied, and led Catherine out to 
the dance floor. 

*************************

Relena leaned in to whisper in Hilde&#39;s ear.

&quot;Now for the real fun,&quot; she said, a mischievous gleam in her eyes. 
Hilde couldn&#39;t help the giggle that escaped her lips, and she nodded. 
Before she knew what was happening, Relena claimed her lips. 

A spark of electricity ran down the German girl&#39;s spine, and she 
replied greedily, deepening the kiss.

**************************

Duo sat next to Heero, pure hate written all over his face. Heero was 
tapping his fingers against one another, considering the chances of 
getting away after killing Hilde. The two looked at each other, and 
understood each other as if they knew how to do telepathy. 

&quot;Your fault,&quot; Duo seemed to say.

&quot;Your fault,&quot; Heero glared, patting his gun with a smirk. Duo&#39;s face 
paled, but he said nothing. They turned their attention back to the 
girls, who were now groping each other, while deeply making out. 

*********************

&#39;Suffer.....&#39;Relena though, but was soon distracted by Hilde&#39;s 
plundering tongue, and moaned into her mouth when Hilde pulled her 
tightly against her body. 

&#39;Fuck one day.....Heero can fuck Duo for all I care...,&#39;Hilde thought, 
enjoying herself more than she was supposed to.

They broke off for air. 

&quot;You know, I&#39;ve been thinking....&quot;Relena started, licking her 
lips,&quot;They threw away our love, why should we let them come back? If 
we meet those sacks of shit again, and they want our love, they can go 
fuck themselves....but right now all I want is you.&quot;

Hilde had tears in her eyes, and threw her mouth onto Relena&#39;s. The 
two shared a passionate kiss, not caring about the stares they were 
receiving. 

One fine day 
We&#39;ll meet once more
And then you&#39;ll want the love you 
Threw away before
One fine day 
You&#39;re gonna want me for your girl

When the two new kois broke off for air, the song ended. They 
gracefully walked over to a table, never leaving eye contact. They 
didn&#39;t notice the two pilots sitting at the table next to them.

As the two say down, a jovial voice yelled to them, &quot;Hilde!&#39;&#39;

The two looked next to them to see Duo and Heero sitting there. 

&quot;Hn.&quot;

Relena snorted, crossing her arms over her chest. 

&quot;Ohayo Duo-kun,&quot; Hilde sighed, scooting next to Relena for protection. 
Atleast that&#39;s what the two boys thought, but it was actually so Hilde 
could sneak a hand onto Relena&#39;s thigh.

&quot;Hi Duo,&quot; Relena smirked. Duo gave a brief frown, before brightening 
once again like a lightbulb. He sat next to Hilde, who rolled her 
eyes.

&quot;What do you need Duo? A hotdog?&quot; Hilde snapped, sitting so close to 
Relena she was almost in the blonde&#39;s lap. Duo looked hurt, then and 
then replied, &quot;No, just wanted to say I&#39;m in love.&quot;

&quot;With what? The buffet Duo? Go ahead, it&#39;s pretty cheap anyway,&quot; 
Relena kept her smirk, and Hilde giggled.

&quot;Ha. Ha. Ha. No, I&#39;m in love with a certain girl with blue eyes, 
midnight blue hair, who&#39;s german,&quot; Duo winked, and Hilde gave him a 
blank look.

&quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot; she asked innocently, but a mischievous gleam was in her 
eyes.

&quot;Her name&#39;s Schbecker, Hilde Schbecker.&quot;

&quot;Oh, well I&#39;m sorry, I heard she was taken...and weren&#39;t you the one 
who said you didn&#39;t love her, or have any feeling for this girl?&quot; 
Relena said, glaring at the braided pilot. Hilde snuggled up to her, 
and Duo felt like the wind had been knocked out of him. He got up and 
walked back to his table, falling into his chair. Feeling this to be 
his cue, Heero got up and walked over. &lt;&gt; &quot;Relena.....&quot;&lt;&gt; The 
politician blinked.&lt;&gt; &quot;Koi,&quot;Hilde murmured in Relena&#39;s ear, and Duo 
winced, &quot;What&#39;s up with him? He a stalker?&quot;&lt;&gt; Relena laughed, and 
Heero glared, pulling out a gun. &lt;&gt; &quot;Omae o korosu,&quot; he growled, 
clicking off the safety and aiming for Hilde&#39;s head. Relena stood up, 
causing Hilde to almost fall over and whine in protest. 

The blonde walked over to Heero, and hugged him. Feeling he won, Heero 
smirked, and secretly stuck his tongue out to Hilde. The girl gasped, 
and felt fresh tears assault her eyes. 

Relena leaned towards Heero&#39;s ear and whispered,&quot;You wish.&quot;

She then withdrew herself from Heero and held her hand out to Hilde. 
The german girl smiled so brightly it lit up the room ten times more 
than it already was. She took her koi&#39;s hand, and the two glided out 
of the ballroom. 

In unison, the two pilots swore, &quot;One fine day, one fucking fine 
day....&quot;
