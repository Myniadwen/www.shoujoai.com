<h1>True Protector (part 3 of 8)</h1>

<a href="../gundam/truprot-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>As she sat there in her bed, Releena reached up to lightly touch her 
lips, and thought of that dream kiss, of Noin&#39;s handsome face bent 
over her own. Before she had a chance to recover, to collect herself, 
figure out what she thought, and how she felt about it, there was a 
rapid knock on her bedroom&#39;s door. Without waiting for her to answer, 
the real Noin stuck her head in the door, the expression on her face 
grim.

&quot;Releena, we have got to be out of here in five minutes or less,&quot; Noin 
said to her tersely, and closed the door. Without letting herself 
think about it, Releena quickly began to dress, while she tossed some 
extra clothes in a travel bag. Obviously, there was some kind of 
trouble, and Noin would explain when she could. Three minutes later, 
shoes on, dressed in pants and T-shirt, she stepped out of her room, 
bag in hand.

&quot;I don&#39;t know yet how they found out we&#39;re here, but the satellite 
data feeds show two modified Virgo&#39;s inbound, E.T.A. seventeen 
minutes. We need to get you out of here, as soon as possible,&quot; Noin 
explained. Releena nodded, and followed Noin at a run out into the 
hallway and down the nearest stairwell.

&#39;I do wish Noin hadn&#39;t picked such a tall building,&#39; Releena thought 
wryly as they barreled down the stairs. &quot;Is there a leak at the 
Preventers, then?&quot; Releena asked Noin breathlessly, hurrying to keep 
up with her.

&quot;Has to be,&quot; Noin said coldly, her expression bleak. &quot;Either our 
electronic systems have been hacked, or there&#39;s a traitor in our 
organization.&quot; They both sighed a bit in relief as they passed the 
sixth floor marker. Only five more to go.

At ground level, they took a moment to catch their breaths. &quot;Will they 
attack the hotel?&quot; Releena asked Noin worriedly.

Noin shook her head. &quot;According to our best information, they&#39;re still 
professionals. It would be a waste of resources, if they attack the 
building and you&#39;re not here. They&#39;ll scan for our distinctive 
lifesigns, then decide if they should or should not attack.&quot;

When they finally ran out into the street, Releena nearly stopped in 
surprise as she instantly recognized the biggest, pinkest car she had 
ever seen, and it was sitting at the curb waiting for them. The 
passenger side door was open, and across the front seat, Dorothy 
Catalonia was waving cheerfully at them both. Noin then all but picked 
the faltering Releena up and tossed her in, then she dove in right 
behind her.

&quot;Move! Move!&quot; Noin barked!

Behind Releena, a heavy door slammed shut loudly, and with a throaty 
roar of the oversized engine they were off. Dorothy flipped two small 
switches on the dashboard, a pair of lights went from green to dark 
red, and without turning around in her seat she asked Releena 
conversationally &quot;How has your vacation been so far, Releena-sama?&quot;

&quot;A little too tense,&quot; Releena answered her dryly. She looked over at 
Noin beside her and asked plaintively &quot;What is she doing here?&quot; 
Dorothy pretended to look wounded, while Noin reluctantly smiled.

Before anyone could say anything more, the two Virgo&#39;s roared by over 
their heads. They buzzed the hotel tower a moment, looking a little 
like irritated bees, then promptly flew off. &quot;I&#39;ve got the E.C.M. 
system you gave me active,&quot; Dorothy said calmly as she gestured to the 
glowing lights on the dashboard, &quot;but if they know what my car looks 
like, we&#39;re dead.&quot;

They waited a minute, then two, before they finally breathed a small 
sigh of relief. &quot;Dorothy&#39;s a Preventer, actually,&quot; Noin said to 
Releena with a smile. &quot;However, she&#39;s not listed in any database or 
payroll file, because of her covert work for us.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got to get my excitement somehow,&quot; Dorothy said modestly. 
Releena softly sighed, and Dorothy grinned at her. &quot;I know a bit about 
the cost of war,&quot; Dorothy said seriously, &quot;and the price of peace. I 
prefer peace.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Releena said softly to Dorothy. She turned back to Noin 
with a frown and asked &quot;What are we going to do now?&quot;

&quot;Keep traveling overland, I&#39;m sorry to say.&quot; Noin smiled a bit, 
continued, &quot;I contacted Miss Dorothy earlier, and she&#39;s been 
establishing a cover so we can travel together without problems.&quot; She 
looked out the window, and frowned as she noticed how fast they were 
travelling. &quot;Where are we going, anyway?&quot;

Totally deadpan, Dorothy answered, &quot;To your wedding, of course. Your 
cover is going to be as a honeymooning couple.&quot;

Noin and Releena stared at her dumbfounded. &quot;What ?!&quot; they both asked 
Dorothy almost exactly together.

Dorothy grinned at the two of them, and passed them each a slim file 
folder. She began to recite from memory: &quot;Rita &#39;Releena&#39; Clark, is 
getting married to Nicole &#39;Noin&#39; Clark. You will be then travel 
together across Europe, honeymoon in the very best hotels and resorts. 
You&#39;re just a very normal pair of boring computer analysts who met on 
the job and fell in love, with a long, fictitious history I won&#39;t tire 
you with now. All the proper papers have been filed, but I though if 
we had some photographic evidence of a real wedding, it would finish 
things off quite nicely.&quot;

Releena was barely able to stop Noin as she tried to lunge across the 
seat at Dorothy, and it didn&#39;t help that she almost wanted to throttle 
her, too!

&quot;Photographic evidence? What are we going to wear for this wedding, 
you aristocratic twit?&quot; Noin roared.

&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; Dorothy said in her exaggerated way, &quot;I almost forgot.&quot; 
Dorothy smoothly pulled the car over, opened the doors and led them 
around to the trunk. She pulled out one garment bag and passed it to 
Noin. &quot;Put this on in the back seat, then sit up front. I&#39;ve put the 
divider to black so you won&#39;t be able to see the bride. Tradition, you 
know,&quot; Dorothy said with a sweet smile. Noin grumbled, but headed off 
to get changed.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s a... very interesting plan,&quot; Releena said to her quietly. 
She smiled a bit, &quot;Noin will probably kill you when it&#39;s over, 
though.&quot;

Dorothy smiled, but her eyes were dead serious. &quot;Releena, the enemy 
we&#39;re dealing with here are former soldiers. Very stodgy people, who 
wouldn&#39;t know fun if it ran up to them and bit them on the ass. 
There&#39;s no way they would expect this,&quot; she finished, and smirked.

Noin opened the car door and climbed out. She cut quite the fine 
figure of a woman, the excellently tailored wedding tuxedo hugged her 
lean form. She reminded one of a noble prince, or a master spy about 
to go out to seduce the beautiful ladies. &quot;Wow,&quot; Dorothy whispered, 
and said more loudly &quot;Can I marry her, too?&quot;

Releena rolled her eyes, took the other garment bag, and climbed in 
the back seat to change. Noin leaned against the car and looked at 
Dorothy steadily, making her sweat a little. Finally, Noin conceded 
&quot;It&#39;s a good plan. I think they will be caught by surprise, assuming 
they even suspect.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Dorothy said and threw her a mock curtsey. They faintly 
heard Releena call for Dorothy, and she excused herself to climb in, 
before she stopped to tell Noin, &quot;No peeking!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s with the lingerie?&quot; Releena sweatdropped as she asked Dorothy 
in a whisper, as she tried to make sure Noin didn&#39;t hear her.

Dorothy laughed and answered &quot;Tradition.&quot; She then set about to snap 
and strap Releena into the various under things, then into the gown 
itself. &quot;I almost envy Noin,&quot; Dorothy sighed, before she stepped out.

Dorothy then ushered Noin back up front, and they were soon on their 
way. A few minutes later, Noin found herself in a country church, 
standing nervouly in front of a very amused looking justice of the 
peace.

&quot;I haven&#39;t seen a wedding set up this fast in years,&quot; he remarked 
leadingly.

Noin, totally deadpan, commented, &quot;I knocked her up, and our parents 
want us to be wed before the baby starts to show.&quot;

The priest looked at her in surprise, then began to quietly laugh. 
Just then the wedding march began, and Noin turned to see Dorothy 
escort the white clad figure up the aisle. The young priest&#39;s words 
were a blur, and only registered to Noin near the end. &quot;Do you, Rita, 
take Nicole, to be your wedded wife?&quot;

Releena answered clearly &quot;I do.&quot;

&quot;Nicole, do you take Rita to be your wedded wife?&quot; the priest asked.

&quot;I do,&quot; Noin croaked.

&quot;Then you may kiss the brides,&quot; he said happily.

When Noin heard that, her blood ran cold. She reached over, hesitantly 
lifted the veil and looked down at Releena&#39;s beaming face, and just 
didn&#39;t know what she should do. Or what Releena wanted her to do...

Releena looked up and realized that Noin was completely frozen. She 
reached up, gently wrapped her arms around Noin&#39;s neck, and then drew 
her down into the wedding kiss. &#39;I think she kisses better in real 
life,&#39; Releena thought to herself dazedly, suddenly remembering what 
happened in the morning&#39;s dream. </pre>
