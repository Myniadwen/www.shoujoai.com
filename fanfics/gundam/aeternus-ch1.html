<pre>Notes: I actually..DID what Relena does in this fic. &lt;blush&gt; But I 
ended up stepping on a crab instead of meeting the love of my life. 
&lt;groan&gt; But it was so magical...

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

He&#146;s flying, and drowning, and standing firmly for the first time, all 
at once. I can see it in his eyes, the way the light glints giddily in 
them. Unfathomable steel, beautiful in and of themselves, but more so 
now that genuine happiness lights them. It&#146;s reflected by a thousand 
mirrors, refracted to pour over the rest of us like a crystal 
splitting light and I&#146;m amazed. 

And I&#146;m ecstatic. 

And I&#146;m jealous. But not as much as I should be. 

I watch the way those eyes in hue of condensed fire, weep when they 
leave the one by his side. How they falter, retract; chill when his 
soulmate is out of sight. It&#146;s terrifying, the sheer depth of emotion 
that echoes there. And again, I&#146;m amazed. How can someone feel so 
much, so deeply, so soon? 

But not shatter? 

Because they ARE soulmates. I&#146;ve seen it. I&#146;ve seen the tears course 
unchecked, and the screams of molten rage, and the tender, undisturbed 
moments when they press their foreheads together, twine their arms 
around each others waist, and are content to gaze into each other&#146;s 
eyes. Two halves of a whole, twin spirits, lovers and best friends and 
so much more. 

And I&#146;m jealous. 

Some say it should have been me to catch the untamed wildfire in his 
eyes. I was his match, the princess and the hero. It was destined. 
Even he believed that for a time, as did the boy wearing his ring. It 
took so long for them to realize that the hero didn&#146;t have to ride 
into the sunset with the future queen in his arms. That he could 
settle in a small apartment with the second soldier from the left 
instead. I helped them there, I think, inadvertently. 

But now I see the rewards of my sacrifice, and I understand that it 
wasn&#146;t so much of a sacrifice as a revelation. 

And I&#146;m ecstatic.

It is often said that love is the most rare and precious gift a person 
could be given. I disagree. They don&#146;t love each other. What they 
share is too incredible to be defined so poorly. It&#146;s the draw of 
magnetic souls, the red thread materialized as two identical bands of 
gold. It is eternity. It is the comprehension of forever. Aeternus. 

And I&#146;m amazed. 

But I&#39;m jealous. I want my own. 

--------------------------- 

Relena shook herself from her thoughts and stood. Dusting her white, 
knee-length skirt free from crumbs and sand, she glanced at the motley 
group crowding the wicker furniture and floor of her villa&#146;s sunroom. 
Heero and Duo were being predictable, focusing totally on each other 
and watching the waves crash against a rocky outcrop to the north. 
Dorothy, Quatre, Wufei and Sally played a game of back-seat chess, 
each cheering on either Trowa or Catherine (Dorothy-being the feminist 
that she was- was practically hanging over Cat&#146;s shoulder in her 
eagerness). The siblings themselves were too absorbed in mutually 
stilted tactics to notice much else. Hilde was curled up alone on a 
floral cushion, watching everyone with an amused half-smile and a 
bottle of premium water. No one looked up as she gathered the 
forgotten tray of pastries and tea and headed towards the kitchen. 

After depositing her burden in the sink of the small kitchen, she 
slipped out through the side door, down towards the beach. She didn&#146;t 
understand fully what she was doing, only that the sound of the waves 
on the snow-white shore seemed to be calling her name. 

As she walked, the crisp autumn breeze lifted the edge of her skirt 
and ruffled her white tank top. It teased her, pushed her until she 
was running towards the waterline. Hot breath panted out of her parted 
lips. Her hair yanked loose from the pristine ribbon binding it, and 
instantly the wind had taken that up as well. She felt -more than saw- 
the honey strands whipped like butter about her shoulder and chin. If 
it weren&#146;t for the sand shoved up through the toes of her sandals, she 
would&#146;ve thought she was flying. 

Or drowning. 

A foot from the surf&#146;s edge she stopped, gasping. Beneath her feet, 
the sand was still dry. Slowly, she bent and slid her sandals off one 
at a time, carefully setting them beyond the reach of the water. Bits 
of broken shell dug pleasantly into the soles of her bare feet. 

So she was standing firmly on the ground. 

The sun was setting. The first dripping rays of gold were slipping 
into the horizon. Shades of tangerine orange, brilliant yellow and 
crimson stained the light blue sky. To the East, the house was framed 
by deepest indigo, much like the color of Duo&#146;s eyes. And stars were 
already sparking into constellations. But Relena had eyes only for the 
wavering reflection playing havoc on the waters of the sea. There it 
seemed each sky-shade was tinted Prussian, glowing in intensity. A 
soft breeze floated like breath from the water. Warm and feather 
light, it brushed across her face and arms, it lifted her stilled 
skirt and ran innocent fingers through her loosened hair. 

Relena followed its command and brought her eyes up to the sun. 

Earth&#146;s Star, unlike anything she&#146;d ever seen before. Instead of the 
magnificent aureate, it was breath-taking pink. Shocking, neon, 
lava-fire pink. The girl felt her heart wrench and her eyes water. It 
was so incredible. A single tear cascaded to the ground. Aeternus&#133; 

The wind, the moment, the image&#133; 

Languidly, Relena grasped the phantom hand of the wind and stepped 
into the surf. 

---------------------- 

Hilde chuckled at Catherine&#146;s explosive expletive. Trowa&#146;d gotten her 
last knight, and was slowly breaking her lines of defense. At this 
point the game was pretty much decided. Quatre, grinning like a 
maniac, red-eyed Dorothy. She returned the childish movement with a 
round of curses and a glare. Sally shook her head tolerantly at the 
bunch of them, still in the process of combing Wufei&#146;s silky hair. As 
for the Chinese pilot, he was purring rather loudly. Duo and Heero 
continued to ignore all of them in favor of each other and the 
cuddle-worthy couch they&#146;d swiped. Relena was&#133; 

Gone? 

Surprised, the shorthaired teen stood up. How had she missed that? 
Wasn&#146;t she the princess&#146;s unofficial bodyguard? It was her job to keep 
an eye on her. Hilde set down her empty bottle, distractedly. 

She sighed, disgusted, when a search of the house turned up no sign of 
the missing girl except a dirty tray in the kitchen. Some bodyguard. 
Couldn&#146;t even find her own charge. With a groan, she pulled open the 
sliding glass door to the balcony, strode out and leaned against the 
rail despondently. Cradling her chin in her hand, she regarded the 
nothingness of middle distance.

WHY do I do this to myself&#133;she asked silently. 

On the beach below, a figure in white caught the light, and caught her 
bemused eyes. Instantly Hilde focused and tried to make out the 
person&#146;s features, but the distance was too great. He was just a blur 
of white. And moving away, slowly. 

An unnerving thought interrupted right about then. 

The Princess&#133;kidnapped? 

Without another regard, the Swede leapt over the rail and pelted as 
fast as she could after the fading form. Her bare feet dug violent 
rivets from the sand and sprayed water as she ran unheeding of the 
ocean&#146;s nearness. Salty air tore breath from her lungs. Worry haunted 
her heartbeat in the enclosing darkness. The sun was half-set. 

It wasn&#146;t until she was twenty feet away that she stopped, stunned. 

Princess? 

Relena was dancing&#133;no, waltzing, clasped in an embrace Hilde could 
almost SEE at the surf&#146;s edge. Her dark aqua eyes were closed as she 
spun and twirled, mimicking the guiding movements of her phantom 
partner. The girl was moving with her heels arced up off the ground, 
the arches of her feet clearly defined. They barely touched the 
ground, and when they did, stepped delicately into the waves, tearing 
up tiny droplets. The spattered sea clung to the folds of her skirt, 
carried up into the air and whirling like a sheath of clouds around 
her long legs. Where the skirt ended, a wide-shouldered tank top had 
come untucked. It formed itself to every curve of her slender waist, 
ribcage and breasts. Golden hair spilled like the disappearing 
sunlight into the air. Breathtaking. As breathtaking as the moonset. 

And in her imagination, the specter had his strong hand in the small 
of her back, the other gripping hers. Her articulate fingers were 
resting lightly on his supportive shoulder. One, two, three, one two 
three&#133;rhythmic. 

They danced. 

Suddenly, volens nolens, Hilde was propelled forward. Though her faded 
cutoffs and grunge T-shirt were nothing compared to Relena&#146;s magic, 
she couldn&#146;t stop herself. The moment was too beautiful to withstand 
merely watching. 

The phantom stepped aside gracefully. 


Hilde closed her eyes, and blindly took his place. A smooth hand 
settled on her shoulder, and warm, elegant fingers clasped her own. 
She sought the gentle hollow at the small of the princess&#146;s back and 
let her hand press into the crisp cotton there. Unconsciously, she 
continued the waltz without a hitch in movement. It was as if they&#146;d 
begun the dance together. 

The sun was setting. 

It took Relena six seconds, six blissful seconds, to realize. 

---------------- 

Somehow, the imaginary arms of my wind-born partner seem real, living. 
The shoulder braced firmly beneath my hand is bone, muscle and cloth. 
The hand on my back is pressure and heat. And the hand in my own is 
knuckle and flesh. The perfect fit, like two jigsaw pieces finally 
finding their way into a whole. So insanely perfect, if only it were 
true&#133; 

Then, warm breath washes over my cheek in a sigh. 

With a choked gasp, I stop. My eyes fly open in shock. 

And I&#146;m amazed. She fits me perfectly. 

&#147;H-Hilde&#133;?&#148; I can hear the stunned question in my own, throaty voice, 
as the waves lap over my stilled feet. The sand shifts with the pull 
of the water. 

The black-haired girl opens her own eyes slowly, looking at me 
soberly. &#147;Relena.&#148; We still haven&#146;t moved from our final step, close, 
only an inch separating us. And I feel my heart speed in time with 
hers. 

The ocean&#146;s roar has increased, drowning out any words we possibly 
could have spoken. Just over Hilde&#146;s shoulder, I can see the brilliant 
sun finally settling into it&#146;s dreaming cradle. For an instant, it&#146;s 
last ray catches in the sky and lights the entire world in an amazing, 
unfathomable shade of blue. 

The same color as Hilde&#146;s eyes. 

And I&#146;m jealous. No one should have that color but her, for me. 

I think I&#146;m flying, and drowning, and standing firmly for the first 
time, all at once.

&#147;I&#133;&#148; she begins to whisper, but the whisper of the waves, and the wind 
and phantom lover, who led us to this point, shush her. 

And I&#146;m ecstatic. Could it be&#133;? 

And I think I&#146;ve found my own Aeternus.
