<h1>Failure of Vision (part 2 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rzrblade.html">Rzrblade33</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gundam/failure-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Heero Yuy.

How I admire him. The Perfect Soldier. Isn&#146;t that what he&#146;s called? 
Admittedly, I&#146;ve always doubted his perfection but I never question 
the title. His flaws are few and hardly noticeable to the untrained 
eye. His dedication to his mission is admirable, and his emotionless 
exterior is a quality every soldier should master.

And he can fuck with Miss Relena&#146;s mind in a such a way that I never 
could, and he does so without even realizing what he&#146;s doing.

Oh, there is no word that can accurately describe how much I admire 
Heero Yuy.

He was made Relena&#146;s personal bodyguard last week. The news both 
delighted and disgusted me. Delighted because I am a sadist, disgusted 
because it won&#146;t be me being truly sadistic.

Honestly I can&#146;t fathom why he would take such a job. The wondrous 
Heero Yuy could do so much more substantial things in life besides 
being a mere bodyguard to a Peacecraft.

That damn driver of hers seems to think he did it out of love.

I scoffed at him

Love. Such a meaningless emotion to have, so destructive. They say 
that it can accomplish anything, fairy tales claim it can move 
mountains, conquer all. I have never once seen love prevail. I&#146;ve only 
seen it weaken and destroy.

If love was his reasoning, he no longer deserves to be called perfect. 
He deserves to be named a fool. Hm. He and Miss Relena might just be 
meant for each other.

Heero arrived yesterday, looking angry and tough and bearing an odd 
resemblance to a GI Joe doll. He carried two bags, a laptop case, and 
a small backpack that supposedly held all of his possessions. He 
scowled at the servant who attempted to take his luggage and resumed 
standing in the entryway, surveying everything in sight with a 
critical eye until his gaze fell upon me.

&quot;Dorothy,&quot; he muttered curtly, glare firmly in place.

I nodded at him and gave my best obviously unpleasant smile. &quot;Heero.&quot;

The silence that enveloped the room was tense. I could feel his 
apprehension; it seemed to move through the air in waves. He still 
views me as an enemy, and I suppose that I am.

I am everyone&#146;s enemy, I think. It&#146;s in my character.

I quite enjoy it.

&quot;Heero!&quot;

The next thing I saw was Relena clinging to him, burying her face in 
his shoulder, and Heero looking vaguely unhappy and pushing her away.

The disappointment on her perfect little face made me smirk. Heero met 
my eye, and I held his gaze bravely before Relena seemed to remember 
my presence.

&quot;Dorothy, you may leave now.&quot;

So I did, smiling maliciously and unable to keep a small bounce out of 
my walk.

* * * * * 

Once upon a time I used to listen to her speeches. Not only did I 
listen diligently, but I made notes in my mind as she was speaking and 
later I would carefully examine them and compare them with my own 
thoughts on the matter.

I&#146;ve learned more about her from her speeches than what she has 
voluntarily told me in conversation.

But that was a long time ago. I&#146;ve since stopped analyzing her words 
and searching for new openings to criticize her foolishness. Her 
speeches, like her, are long, drawn out, and utterly predictable. I&#146;m 
certain that she has a paper in her desk somewhere with one that she 
prepared years ago, and she merely changes a few words to make it seem 
different than when she gave it last week.

So I don&#146;t listen.

Instead I decide to play a little game with the boy standing behind 
Relena for my amusement.

Seeing Heero Yuy daily has proved to be much different than what I had 
imagined. I thought he would almost be invisible, slipping in and out 
of rooms without anyone realizing it. I&#146;d thought he was a true 
soldier, a perfect soldier.

He has an aura, a certain mood that just seems to radiate from his 
body. The temperature of a room decreases several degrees when he 
enters. I often wonder if he exhales ice instead of air when he 
breathes.

My eyes haven&#146;t left him since the second Miss Relena began to speak. 
I know that he can feel the weight of my stare, and I know that he&#146;s 
attempting to avoid looking at me. His gaze has touched every person 
in the room. Except me.

I make him uneasy. Heero Yuy is unsettled by me.

Almost as though reading my thoughts and setting out to disprove them, 
his eyes meet mine. He&#146;s lost the first game and aims to win the 
second. I feel the man sitting next to me shift awkwardly, obviously 
unnerved by our staring contest. I ignore him and continue to stare 
unblinking at Heero.

Relena&#146;s speech ends, her point finally made, and various listeners 
murmur their opinion on it to whoever cares to listen.

Sensing that the game is coming to a close I smile sweetly and wink.

He looks away.

For the moment, I&#146;ve won.

* * * * *

&quot;I&#146;ve never really understood people like you.&quot;

The words are spoken softly, almost inaudibly, and yet with such 
superiority it is almost sickening to hear. She speaks to me as though 
I&#146;m lower than her, unworthy of her time, a peasant.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; My voice is equally quiet and void of any emotion. 
I&#146;ve learned a few things from our new arrival, even if all we do is 
stare at each other.

&quot;Homosexuals,&quot; she answers, cocking her head to one side.

I can only blink at her. Homosexuals. People like me. The words echo 
in my mind, but I can find no real fault with them, except of course 
for the word me. Apparently whatever abnormal relationship we&#146;ve 
formed is one-sided, rape, something that she has no part of.

&quot;It&#146;s unnatural,&quot; she continues and I notice that she is studiously 
avoiding my eyes. &quot;Men and women just fit together, like a puzzle.&quot;

It&#146;s an odd moment to be having this conversation, when neither of us 
is fully clothed and both still flushed. She&#146;s trying to convince 
someone, and I suspect it is herself. But, honestly, it is a little 
late for denial.

I can&#146;t stop myself from asking her the question that forms in my 
mind. &quot;Then why are you here?&quot;

She pauses and frowns. I&#146;ve unnerved her, and I feel a shiver run 
through my spine at the thought.

&quot;I don&#146;t know,&quot; she says finally. &quot;When I figure it out myself, then 
I&#146;ll let you know.&quot;

A peasant, indeed.
