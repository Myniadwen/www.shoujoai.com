<h1>The Best Thing</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mizunomouri.html">Mizuno Mouri</a><br> </h2>
<pre>[Never want to fly 
Never want leave
Never want to say what you mean to me
Never want to run
Frightened to believe
You&#39;re the best thing about me]

Do you have to be so beautiful Lucrezia? Do you even realize how 
beautiful you are to me? I guess I never express to you how I feel and I 
never did, even when you got together with Sally. I just watched your 
relationship bloom and blossom into a beautiful flower, a flower I 
wished to rip apart. I want you for my own, for me to take and ravage as 
my own, not Sally&#39;s. Yet all these emotions, I&#39;ll never be able to 
express vocally to you, I am too stubborn to say so myself.

[Sometimes I feel like this only chemistry
Stuck in a maze searching for a way to
Shut down turn around feel the ground beneath me
You&#39;re so close where do you end and where do I begin?
Always pushing and pulling]

Some days when you&#39;re talking to me I feel myself bubble over with 
emotions. They rule me and I keep thinking; is it only lust that has me 
drawn to you? I keep running those thoughts through my mind; completely 
forsaking the conversation we are having, and even the meetings we 
sometimes attend together. I am so confused, every time I see you with 
Sally, I&#39;m gushing over the fact that you two make a beautiful couple, 
but after the first feeling I quickly turn myself over to the jealously 
I hold in my heart. I want you so bad Lucrezia, so very badly.

[Sometimes sanity takes vacation time on me
I&#39;m in a daze stumbling bewildered
North of gravity head up in the stratosphere
You and I roller coaster riding love
You&#39;re the center of adrenaline
And I&#39;m beginning to understand]

It&#39;s driving me crazy, the feelings I harbor for you. They never stop 
and every time you say my name I shiver in the amazement of it all. I 
wish I hear you just once moan my name, groan it because of the things I 
do to you. I become clouded by lust every time I&#39;m around you; it&#39;s so 
amazing. I love the feelings I get; they take me to new heights I never 
knew existed. You create things in me that I have just now discovered; 
you&#39;re my muse Lucrezia. 

[Never want to fly
Never want leave
Never want to say what you mean to me
Never want to run
Frightened to believe
You&#39;re the best thing about me]

And yet during all of this I am still unwilling to tell you how I feel. 
I can&#39;t; I don&#39;t want to shatter the bond you and Sally share. I know 
you are madly in love with her, that much is obvious. You hang on her 
every word and worship the ground she walks on. Why can&#39;t you do that 
for me? Why can&#39;t it be me, why? You&#39;ve kept me strong during all these 
long years. Gave me strength when no one else did, comforted me when I 
had no one to turn to, and held me when I was broken down in tears. 
You&#39;re so strong; Sally has it great.

[Walk on broken glass make my way through fire
These are the things I would do for love
Farewell peace of mind kiss goodbye to reason
Up is down the impossible occurs each day
This intoxication thrills me
I only pray it doesn&#39;t kill me]

You&#39;re leaning over me now. You came to visit suddenly and I don&#39;t know 
why. I am just glad you didn&#39;t bring that vixen, Sally, along. I get to 
have you all to myself, to bad not the way I want it. I can smell the 
shampoo in your hair; it&#39;s peppermints. Something about that is so 
enticing to me, I want to take you right there but because of how I was 
raised I won&#39;t. I&#39;ll be silent and listen to you give me advice. If you 
only knew how I felt, things would be so different and I know it.

[Never want to fly
Never want leave
Never want to say what you mean to me
Never want to run
Frightened to believe
You&#39;re the best thing about me]

I give you my regards as we go to bed, me to my room and you to your 
room, how unfortunate. I almost follow you into your room, but I stop 
myself in mid step and go off to my room, very much pouting. Damn it 
all! I want you! I resign myself to one thing now, I will tell you how I 
feel and I will do it tonight! In fact I will do it now! I crawl out of 
my bed and leave my room quickly, heading for yours. I will reveal the 
truth tonight! You will know how I feel! 

I reach your door and slowly turn the doorknob; a muffled sob fills the 
air. I open the door quickly to find you on your bed crying your heart 
out. I run over to you and pull you into my arms. You mumble incoherent 
things as I hold you close to me. I am being turned on because you are 
so close to me but I turn off the hormones for now. I quietly ask you 
what is wrong and you tell me. You and Sally are no longer together. 
What wonderful joy this brings to me! I finally have my chance! I will 
make you mine now! 

[You&#39;re the center of adrenaline
And I&#39;m beginning to understand
You could be the best thing about me]

Your tears fall onto my bedclothes and I slowly rub circles on your 
back. You relate to me the whole story of what happened between you, 
Sally, and Une. That bitch! How could she have done this to you! I will 
hunt her down for this and slaughter her for it! K&#39;so, where&#39;s Heero Yuy 
when you need him? For once in my life my thoughts stray from myself to 
someone else. I lift you head up with a single finger pulling your chin 
up. I kiss away your tears and watch the surprise look cross your face. 
I smile softly and you just stare at me. I know you can&#39;t help but 
wonder. 

[Never want to fly
Never want leave
Never want to say what you mean to me
Never want to run
Frightened to believe
You&#39;re the best thing about me]

I just pull you closer and kiss you again, only this time on the lips. 
Strangely enough you don&#39;t resist, that pleases me so much. Instead you 
make the kiss go deeper, opening your mouth for my questing tongue, 
which you eagerly suckle. I pull back for breath and release a deep sigh 
and smile again, as you smile at me.

&quot;Lucrezia Noin, I love you&quot; I kiss her again. I&#39;ve said it; I&#39;ve 
admitted my love. She is happy, I can tell, and so am I. 

[You could be the best thing about me
What if you&#39;re the best thing about me?]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
