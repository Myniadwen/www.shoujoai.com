<h1>The Chase</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alithea.html">Alithea</a><br> </h2>
<pre>A predatory grin slid across her face the minute she entered the club. 
The pulse of the music and the strobing lights made her feel at ease. 
Her companion was already dancing a bit as he moved through the crowd 
with her. She eyed the masses deciding on her destination. He moved up 
beside her and smiled broadly.

&#147;So what shall we play tonight&#148;, he asked still dancing, nearly 
blending into the darkness of the room with his attire. &#147;Phone 
numbers&#133;or drinks?&#148;

She whipped around, same smile on her face and arched an eyebrow. His 
own smile stretched a little more. 

&#147;Oh I see&#133;Well in that case may I remind you that last time we 
played... I won.&#148;

&#147;You only won because that random guy came over and gave you his 
number&#133;and it doesn&#146;t really count since we were only counting girls&#148;, 
she reminded him, her voice carrying nicely over the music. &#147;Do you 
have a rubber band?&#148;

He reached into his pocket and shrugged. &#147;Sorry&#133;guess you&#146;re just gonna 
have to live with the tangles.&#148;  

&#147;I guess&#148;, she replied. Her eyes still moving over the massive crowd 
watching the way the room moved to the music. Catching the forms of 
those she held as possibilities and those she knew were challenges. He 
was dancing closer to her now, trying to get her to move and make up 
her mind. Her mind was set, very set. Upon reaching the bar she ordered 
a 7&amp;7 and he, with a wink ordered some interesting bottled import. He 
smacked his lips at the taste. 

&#147;Gonna stand here all night and eye the crowd or is the cat actually 
going to play&#148;, he asked with casual eagerness.

&#147;Duo&#148;, she paused letting her feral, if not delighted grin take hold. 
&#147;I plan to have fun.&#148;

He nodded. There were all sorts of smiles and grins in the world, but 
she held the record for having the most. Each slight movement of her 
lips placed her mood and he knew almost all of them. Being around her 
was like watching an old pro at work. The way she moved through the 
pulsing crowd like it was water, the way she would find her victims and 
draw them in only to suddenly leave them, jaws on the floor wondering&#133; 
what sort of heavenly creature had just graced their presence. Her deep 
eyes sparked offers and refusals like a song. Her voice offered the 
headiest wit and he was glad he had someone he could spar with and 
stretch his sarcastic muscles. She sipped at her drink, a sudden 
eyebrow perked.

&#147;So what does the cat see that I don&#146;t&#148;, he asked. He tried to see past 
her gaze, but wasn&#146;t quite sure where her eyes were focused.

&#147;Oh that just makes me all giddy inside&#148;, she remarked suddenly. She 
leaned back so that Dou could hear her. &#147;In the far back corner all 
alone, sipping a glass of wine&#148;, she said pointing off in the distance.

He followed her finger. Marveling at her accuracy in the fairly dark 
room. &#147;What is she doing here?&#148;

&#147;Isn&#146;t it obvious&#148;, Dorothy said lightly. &#147;She&#146;s waiting for me.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t kid yourself. She&#146;s not here looking for anything but alone 
time&#148;; he quipped.

She shook her head, her platinum blonde hair swaying with her. &#147;No one 
comes to a place like this to be alone sweets&#148;, she remarked quickly. 
&#147;No one.&#148;

&#147;That a bet I hear?&#148;

&#147;Maybe.&#148;

He shook his head. &#147;Y&#146;know I understand the need for a challenge but 
aren&#146;t you going a bit too far. You get like this every time you and-&#147;

She spun around and looked him square in the eye. He knew the look. It 
was the one that said, &#147;game on&#148; and the use of wit with the force of a 
nuclear blast was forthcoming if he dared to finish his sentence.

He smiled. &#147;Okay&#133;okay&#133;just thought I&#146;d remind you. You go have fun with 
your mice cat&#133;I&#146;m hitting the dance floor. I think I see a few souls 
begging for a confessional.&#148;

It echoes&#133;
Pulse
It breathes&#133;
Pulse
It moves&#133;
And you aren&#146;t ready
No you aren&#146;t ready&#133;
Pulse
Moving like an angel&#133;
Dangerous&#133;
Elegant&#133;
It wants&#133;
Pulse
It desires&#133;
Pulse
And you aren&#146;t ready
No you aren&#146;t ready&#133;
Not for this&#133;
Not for me&#133;
But here I am&#133;
And I will take&#133;
Pulse
I will move&#133;
Pulse
I will break&#133;
Pulse
Just like an echo&#133;
Just like a breath&#133;
Pulse
Do you feel it&#133;?
You aren&#146;t ready

Her plan was clear, but her plans always were. She wondered though if 
she could spark the attention she wanted. Her target was notoriously 
difficult. She made her way over to the section of the club her prey 
was located at and as she sipped her drink just walked by. Her eyes 
sparked as she was watched, brown eyes moving over her in sudden 
awareness.

&#147;Perfect&#148;, she muttered. She set her drink down on a table and eyed the 
dance floor. As expected her friend was already standing atop one of 
the raised dancing platforms showing off. Her feet expertly took her 
over to the platform; he smiled as she stepped up.

&#147;What happened? She shoot you down&#148;, he asked playfully still moving as 
if he were God&#146;s gift to the dance floor.

&#147;Planning love&#148;, she replied. &#147;You have to make them come to you 
sometimes.&#148;

He shook his head trying to hold back his laughter. There was no way he 
could picture Dorothy winning this. Even if she had things planned to 
the hilt, which by the way she was moving, he could tell, she did. He 
nudged her a bit and she faced him. 

&#147;Wanna up the stakes&#148;, he asked, bright baby blues a light.

&#147;How?&#148;

&#147;Time limit.&#148;

She shut her eyes taking in the pull of the rhythm. She was, for once, 
very pleased with the DJ. As her eyes opened she replied, &#147;What do I 
get for winning?&#148;

&#147;The girl isn&#146;t enough?&#148;

&#147;I want her anyway&#133;at least for the moment. I am here to play remember. 
So what do I get if I win?&#148;

&#147;Me.&#148;

&#147;Ha!&#148; She never laughed so hard in her life. &#147;Duo the purpose of a bet 
is to offer something I want, not give me a reason for losing.&#148;

He frowned and then smiled as he let loose a, &#147;Just kidding! You 
wouldn&#146;t be able to handle me anyway. But seriously&#133;I know you can&#146;t 
win.&#148;

&#147;Oh&#133; how is that?&#148;

He looked out at the crowd. &#147;Because your target is now missing&#148;, he 
stated. He performed his brief &#145;I won&#146; dance. &#147;Mission&#133; aborted. You 
just can&#146;t let yourself be distracted like that Dorothy. That&#146;s why I&#146;m 
the winner and you&#133;&#148; He watched as she sprang off the platform and into 
the crowd. &#147;Did I miss something?&#148;

I am not a game to win
I am not your sport
I am not a thing you choose
I don&#146;t mingle with your sort
Try and catch me
Just you dare
Try and play my heart
You will find that some things love
Are made to fall apart

It wasn&#146;t defeat. It wasn&#146;t losing. She wasn&#146;t chasing because she 
wanted to play, or at least the game was much different than she led 
Duo to believe. This was something a little deeper, almost personal. 
She was playing for reason not lust and certainly not escape. She 
played for escape, she would give Duo that and he was right, it was 
always much worse just after she ended a something with her favorite 
princess. But those games, that pull of wills was over. It was done. 
She refused to push her lovely diplomat off the cliff and watch her 
burn&#133;She wouldn&#146;t let the darling girl win that easily. No. It was 
done, a few months dead in the water. She was after something else. 
Something that escaped her at every turn&#133; refused to be caught and 
questioned. Something silent and cruel that took and refused with just 
as much grace and elegance as Dorothy did. The music swirled around her 
and while outwardly cool, her eyes searched frantically. She felt a tap 
on her shoulder. 

&#147;Dorothy is that you&#148;, a semi-familiar voice questioned.

She turned to face the interruption. She raised an amused eyebrow at 
the couple now in front of her. Heero and Hilde, it made her want to 
laugh. Not because they were a ridiculous couple but because of the 
surroundings.

&#147;However did you get him here&#148;, Dorothy asked.

&#147;Force of will alone&#148;, was the reply.

&#147;Hn.&#148;

The encounter didn&#146;t last long. Dorothy pointed the couple towards Duo 
who was busy dancing with two other familiar faces. She went on 
continuing her search, almost upset that she couldn&#146;t find what she was 
looking for.

Sweet and chilled
I own it still
That need to make things clear
The need to make you fear
I am here
I am here
Soft and low
All I know
The lust for something great
That lust that comes too late
I am here 
I am here
What shall we play today dear
What do you fear
I am here
I am here
Whispered prayers
Lost souls that never cared
But&#133;
I am here
I am here
Moving near
Shedding tears
Wanting dear&#133;
Wanting&#133;
I am here
Waiting
I 
Am&#133;
Here

The trio left the platform as the couple approached and together the 
group made its way to a semi-quiet place to sit and chat. Duo stretched 
back in his chair and went on at length about his evening of sweet 
ladies falling for him and how he had a pocket full of phone numbers to 
prove it. The short blonde young man laughed a bit at the obvious 
exaggeration. Heero and the blonde&#39;s silent companion both &#39;&#145;Hned&#148;.

&#147;So&#148;, the silent one began to ask. &#147;Where&#146;s the cat?&#148;

&#147;Catherine wasn&#146;t coming tonight remember&#148;, Quatre replied with a 
smile, gently reminding.

&#147;No&#148;, his tall companion replied. &#147;The other cat.&#148;

&#147;Miss Catalonia is at present on a very serious mission&#148;; Duo burst in. 
&#147;No way she&#146;ll win this one though.&#148;

&#147;Why do you two always have to do that&#148;, the blonde asked with concern. 
&#147;I mean don&#146;t you ever get tired of the useless collection of phone 
numbers and one night stands.&#148;

&#147;It was her idea. Besides a little healthy competition is just what she 
needs right now.&#148;

&#147;Hn.&#148; It was Heero.

&#147;Are there any other words in your vocabulary or has your girlfriend 
sucked them all out of you&#148;, Duo asked. &#147;Ow!&#148; Was his response to a 
slight kick from under the table by Hilde.

&quot;Serves you right&quot;, she smirked.

Heero shook his head and then spoke. &#147;I have plenty of words I just 
choose to use them wisely. Who exactly is she chasing anyway?&#148;

&#147;Une.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;  Three voices all gasped at once. In the distance there was 
another &#147;Hn&#148;. 

The jovial young man was now confused. &#147;What? So the girl likes a 
challenge&#133;who cares? She needs to play&#133;you know how she gets if she 
doesn&#146;t&#148;, he looked over at the short blonde with a knowing smile. 

&#147;Uh Duo&#148;, Quatre peeked. He bent over the table and whispered in his 
ear.

&#147;How is it&#133;that I&#146;m always the last to know things like that&#148;, he shook 
his head and sighed. &#147;Great.&#148;

It was then that the blonde&#146;s quiet companion spoke again. &#147;We 
shouldn&#146;t be talking about this.&#148;

&#147;Why&#148;, Duo questioned.

Trowa let a slight smile slip and answered, &#147;Because the cat&#146;s mission 
is sitting two tables away from us.&#148; 

The five all looked in the direction Trowa had invisibly motioned to 
with his eyes and then looked away quickly.

&#147;Oh yeah that was smooth&#148;, Duo chirped. &#147;Look ...let&#146;s not worry huh? 
The cat can take care of her self. There is no need to worry. Let&#146;s 
just go dance.&#148;

 It&#146;s fun to see them scamper so
To run away and hide
To feel me near and suddenly fear
I am watching
But it&#146;s all for reason
And not for truth
And not for beauty 
Or anything so vile
Just I&#146;m watching 
I&#146;m waiting
And I think I&#146;ll take a while


Giving up wasn&#146;t an option for her but she needed a break from her 
pursuit. So she went to the dance floor again and practiced her art. 
Let the pulse of the music over take her senses as she moved, regaining 
her purpose as she called admires to her with simple movements, slight 
seductions. Then she would leave them breathless and lost. She danced 
to remind her self, should she chance to forget (but she never forgot), 
that she was a creature to be worshiped and longed for. That her power 
was deep and her will strong, and as the weak fell to her need Dorothy 
closed her eyes. Reopening them with a spark as she realized&#133;she was 
being watched, closely. She hadn&#146;t lost. She was still hitting her 
mark. Her bet&#133;that soft and cruel thing she wanted was still with her. 
She wondered why she ever felt that bit of panic that meant defeat and 
the end of the game. It was lost now though. Whatever doubt there may 
have been washed away and her predatory, nearly longing, smile returned 
to her face from its short absence. 

Are you ready for me?
I don&#39;t think you know
I don&#39;t think you&#39;re aware
Where I want to take this
Where I want to end this
It all comes down to you
And when you think you&#39;ve won
When you think you have everything you want
I&#39;ll turn it all around
I&#39;ll make things slick with doubt
Do you think you&#39;re ready
I don&#39;t think you know
But I have you
And you can&#39;t escape

Hazelnut colored eyes watched her through the dense crowd. They&#39;d been 
watching since she walked in, but she remained hidden until she wanted 
to be seen. She knew that once the girl saw her there she&#39;d be a 
target. So she waited at first, and then after being spotted and summed 
up she hid again. Waiting. She had to wait. Had to be sure just what 
the game was and why it was being played out. This girl didn&#39;t play 
like the others. She could be all at once everything and then nothing. 
Une slowly stood from her hiding place and moved in just a bit closer. 
She nimbly situated herself against a wall. It was much closer than her 
other vantage points had been. She was a step, maybe two, away from the 
divine young goddess who was calling for her. That young soul that 
willed her near and asked (although it could have been a 
demand)...asked for audience. Up against that wall the ex-colonel could 
feel the very fiber of the music moving through the room. Feel the beat 
strike her heart and let the lights dance across her form. It was pure 
meditation that no one really ever saw, and more cultured than others 
(who were perhaps much younger or far older than she was...in mind and 
spirit) cared to recognize. She closed her eyes briefly, recalling all 
she let herself lose. What she let the war take, and what she 
sacrificed for love all briefly scattered in her mind. The music 
reminded her of the battles she fought the most scaring of which took 
place within her own mind. Her soft, sometimes cold eyes opened as the 
song changed and she watched as the sweat dripped from the goddess&#39; 
brow. Watched the worshipers flock to her and offer up their prayers, 
knowing they could get close but never touch. No one dared touch. 

Moving through shadows
I am the spell
Whispering through crowds
I am the wind
The dark
The one
The only one
Dancing close to the flames
I am the elegant
The graceful
The light
The empty 
I am winter
I dare sacred space
Moving through the oceans
Singing in the seas
Kings...
Queens...
Soldiers...
The lost...
They all embrace me
Moving through the smoke
The thick of the fog
I&#39;m the only one who dares
To touch the gods

Feeling her prey so close was unbearably straining. And when the arm 
wrapped around her waist, signaling her victory she almost laughed. 
They moved together nicely, the music and the crowd seemingly 
disappeared as they traveled. She kept her back turned, pulled her 
massive mane of golden tresses over her shoulder and settled into the 
pull of her captive. She was surprised how well her target danced, 
keeping pace...almost leading. The touch of her hips moving 
hypnotically, with the older woman&#39;s in steady, calculated time. She 
smiled as she realized this was a duel game. Both opponents had been 
playing, but with separate rules and regulations. It was amusing. Hot 
bittersweet breath touched her ear, as an elegantly experienced hand 
dared to breeze down her neck. 

&quot;So dearest Aphrodite&quot;, Une whispered closely. &quot;You summoned me?&quot;

&quot;Did I&quot;, was the perfectly timed reply, whispered just as closely. She 
was aware, suddenly of the scent of roses around her.

&quot;Don&#39;t be coy.&quot; She spun her partner around so better to see her face. 
Held her in close like she was about to start a waltz. &quot;I know when I&#39;m 
called. So... you&#39;d like a chat?&quot;

&quot;Maybe.&quot; She pulled.

&quot;Or perhaps...something more formal...How about tea?&quot; She pushed.

&quot;Perhaps.&quot; It was impossible for Une to escape now. The music&#133;the 
intoxicating pull of the crowd, it was divinity something sacred being 
dared. 

&quot;Or&quot;, she paused setting her lips in range so that her low and 
dangerous voice could be heard. &quot;Maybe you would like something much 
closer?&quot; The words left her as silent as a prayer. She pulled, 
insinuating casually&#133;prying&#133;taking&#133;Intentions flying through them as 
the pulse quickened.

Don&#39;t feel rushed
Don&#39;t feel pushed
I just want to make things bright
So you can see
You don&#39;t have to decide
You don&#39;t have to offer a thing
I just want things out
Open 
So they won&#39;t be over looked

He took a sip from his bottled water, looking out at the crowd. He 
needed to break away from the masses and breathe a while before being 
pulled into the dance again. When he caught an interesting sight he 
pushed through the crowd to pull out a few others for air. As the 
others followed him he lead the enthusiastic young man with the long 
braid up to the top of the stairs. 

&quot;Look&quot;, he said quietly.

&quot;At what&quot;, Duo asked.

&quot;You just lost your bet&quot;, was all the tall and mostly silent young man 
said before stepping down to his blonde companion.

Duo&#39;s eyes stretched across the sea of gyrating bodies not sure if he 
could believe his friend&#39;s observation. Finally his baby blues saw what 
he wasn&#39;t sure he wanted to see. His friends stood half way up the 
steps and as they all looked out to the crowd fell speechless. Finally, 
a single Hn rang in their ears.

&quot;Dangerous&quot;, he mentioned and shook his head. His hand caught a hold of 
Hilde&#39;s and they continued the journey up the stairs over to the bar. 

Quatre looked worried. &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to do something Duo?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s to do? They&#39;re just dancing&quot;, he said, trying to make things 
sound better. 

&quot;Let her know she&#39;s won and get her away from-&quot;

&quot;Quatre Ol&#39; buddy...I know what you want me to do, but I&#39;m telling 
you...She&#39;s playing something I don&#39;t know the rules to. And....you 
know full well the penalty for jumping in to save her&quot;, Duo interrupted 
and bounded over to the bar. 

He was worried. There was no doubt. But if Dorothy wanted to chase 
there was nothing he could do. He wondered what the cat had in mind, 
and then he considered that it might be the cat...not the mouse that 
was being chased in this case. The two women on the dance floor had 
things to work out, issues that needed clearing. Despite any pleas do 
otherwise Duo Maxwell was just going to stand back and hope that his 
friend knew what she was doing. He sipped at his drink trying to be 
suave and conversational but that ended when Trowa looked out at the 
sea of people and spoke.

&quot;Where did they go?&quot;  

Duo sprang out of his seat. &quot;They&#39;re gone?&quot; 

Trowa just nodded slightly.

He took a gulp from his beer and was about to leap into the crowd to 
find Dorothy when he suddenly jumped. A small vibration in his pocket 
caught him off guard and he huffed as he pulled his phone out of his 
pocket. He cleared his throat trying sound cool as he answered. &quot;This 
is Duo, God of the bedroom.... Where are you?&quot; His tone slipped into 
the serious. &quot;Don&#39;t sound too excited there...you haven&#39;t won 
anything...No I will not up the stakes...Where are you?..... Really?&quot; 
The group finally took notice of the conversation just as he hung up. 
He looked over at them, smiled and with a shrug stated, &quot;Well...the 
cat&#39;s won.&quot;

&quot;Which cat&quot;, Trowa questioned.

Far away I found meaning
In something simply complicated
There was freedom in that race
That chase she made me lead
Far away I found grace
In the devil&#39;s claws
I found peace
In the thunderous echoes of her heart
The past no longer exists
There is only what is
What I can find here
In the daylight
Away from the dark
Away from greedy hearts
