<h1>Back Down</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/catelf.html">Catelf</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The door squeaks as usual when I open it. Same as the coat closet, 
where I tiredly deposit my light wind breaker and worn Nikes. Yeeh, 
this place is screaming for some WD40. A paint job wouldn&#146;t hurt 
either. The walls are littered with botched nail holes. What can I 
say? I&#146;m no good at hanging pictures. Or keeping my hands off the 
walls, like Momma always said. But it&#146;s home. I like it. My small 
apartment on Duraf Avenue, third story, suite 62. Yeah. Home. 

After fixing myself a good-sized G&amp;T, I flop bonelessly into the 
once-maroon couch that dominates most of the living room. I say &#145;into&#146; 
because the thing&#146;s so old it gives completely under the slightest 
weight. Damn, cheap rip-off. Never shoulda let the cute salesgirl talk 
me into it. But it&#146;s mine. So I like it. Not much has ever been mine. 
And it&#146;s like the embrace of an old friend, when the cushions fold 
around me. I only ever had one real friend and he bolted months ago 
for a war-buddy who stopped by to sweep him off his feet. Funny, I 
never pegged Duo that way. Maybe if I had we wouldn&#146;t a&#146; grown apart 
so quickly. 

Man, my mind still has trouble equating Duo with the word stranger. 

But I can&#146;t hate him for leaving me. He was never mine. Hell, I think 
as I find the remote and flick on the vidset, if it weren&#146;t that 
loud-mouthed American, I wouldn&#146;t have met her. 

Her. 

Ironically, she&#146;s on the damn screen right now. The first thing I see. 
Preaching again. Peace this, peace that, make love not war, blah blah 
blah. That shit always turned me off. I mean, sure, I love peace, I 
love being able to come home every night without a new bruise or blood 
on my hands. 

Hey, on that track, seems there&#146;s a stain I missed right here. 

Must be the liquor. I swish my iced gin thoughtfully. My mind is 
wandering. But geez, all that preachy-speechy-spiel can bore a girl 
after awhile. Anyone&#146;s mind would roam. Really. 

Or it could be the hooch. 

High-n-Mighty lecture or not, I could listen to her voice for hours. 
It&#146;s just that type; Melodic, soothing, infinitely gentle. At the same 
time fierce and impassioned. God she could rouse a hoard of mutes with 
a voice like that. 

Personally, I always thought her voice was her best feature. But, lo 
and behold, the masses seem to disagree. I mean, her eyes are 
incredible. Dark aqua, like looking at the Marianas Trench from an 
airplane window. And framed by lashes that put Maybelline commercials 
to shame. Gorgeous. Especially when she wears green. For some crazy 
reason she does that rarely. Some diplomat shit, I bet. Her voice is 
still better. 

Well, in reiteration, green or not, she&#146;s got the figure. Unlike me. I 
guess your personality comes out in your body. She&#146;s curvy, soft, 
pastel and rose. I&#146;m sharp and angular, pale skin, biting colors. As 
opposite as opposite can get. 

&#133;And yet&#133;we fit. 

Oh god, we fit. So well. So damn well. Too damn well. 

Wistful never suited me. I hate this mood. Maybe I shouldn&#146;t think of 
her, because thinking of her always brings me to this point. I&#146;ve 
tried that. Oh, I can&#146;t help it. She&#146;s so goddamned beautiful. Too 
beautiful for a soldier like me.

Maybe it&#146;s the liquor. Gotta be the liquor. I lean forward for a 
better view of her fervent face. 

Ah, Relena, my love. You&#146;re so high now. Flying through breathless 
air. I can see the birds hundreds of feet below, bowing. They idolize 
you, but they can&#146;t reach. Those heights are for you alone, the one 
place I couldn&#146;t follow. Because I can&#146;t reach the stars. But if I 
could&#133; 

You&#146;ll stay there, on the crown of the stars, at the top of the world, 
I think. For a long, long time. Until dreams can survive by themselves 
again, and the world turns on an axis other than your effort. But you 
won&#146;t always be needed. And someday, the heights won&#146;t be so high 
anymore. 

Me, I&#146;ll sit here waiting on my frumpy couch, doing my mindless job 
and losing my battle with age. It&#146;ll be a long time to wait. But I 
promised. 

So I&#146;ll be here when you come back down.
