<h1>Failure of Vision (part 4 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rzrblade.html">Rzrblade33</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gundam/failure-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>She is having a nightmare.

I admit that I&#146;m surprised. It&#146;s been so long since she&#146;s had one, 
three months at least. She used to have them every night.

I know, because I hear them. Every single one of them.

She&#146;s quite loud when she has a nightmare. She thrashes and whimpers. 
She cries and shakes. She could win an Academy Award for her 
performances in her sleep.

And unlike any normal person, she won&#146;t wake up in the middle of her 
nightmares. She has to endure the whole thing, beginning to end.

I wonder sometimes what she dreams about, who she dreams about. I 
wonder if tonight her nightmares feature Heero or Duo. I wonder if she 
dreams about me, if I&#146;m ever the cause of her nightmares.

My feet move on their own, shuffling to her bed where she lays under 
the covers, her head whipping sharply from side to side. I sit down 
beside her body and feel the tremors that she is emitting.

I don&#146;t believe that I&#146;ve ever experienced a nightmare quite like 
Relena does. I have the occasional bad dream where I wake up panting 
and afraid, but even those are rare. I have not had one of those since 
I was a little girl.

I remember those dreams, quite vividly in fact. It was always the same 
dream: me fighting with the parents that I hardly remember now. The 
fight was always different but it emanated from the same idea: they 
were holding me back, trying to control me. I ended up murdering them 
each time.

Relena is whimpering now, her head movements are violent. She&#146;s 
murmuring something that I can&#146;t make out. But it sounds suspiciously 
similar to &quot;Father&quot;.

I&#146;m not surprised. It seems only fitting that she would dream of her 
&#145;father&#146;, his death. I wonder if she&#146;s dreaming that she killed him. I 
wonder if her nightmares are anything like mine used to be. I wonder 
if maybe we have more in common that I originally believed.

She begins to thrash wildly, her whimpers turning quickly to cries. 
One of her flailing arms hits my leg, leaving a harsh sting. Her face 
contorts; she is in pain, emotional torture or maybe physical.

I rest my hand on her forehead, for reasons that I don&#146;t understand. I 
want to feel her pain, experience it for myself.

Her tossing ceases. Her cries decrease in volume until they are a mere 
echo in my ears. She begins to look calm and peaceful. The only thing 
that even suggests that she has just had a nightmare is the sweat on 
her forehead, which I feel more than I see. She rolls her head and 
sighs quietly, leaning against my arm.

I jerk my hand away, as though it has been burned. And for a second 
I&#146;m sure that it has. It is hot, unbelievably so. I stand, not taking 
my eyes off of her face. She licks her lips in her sleep and nuzzles 
the pillow, a sign that I know all too well.

She is happy, content.

I am disgusted.

I laid my hand on her and she calmed. I chased away her nightmares. My 
touch soothed her.

I begin to back away towards the doorway, holding my still burning arm 
away from my body.
