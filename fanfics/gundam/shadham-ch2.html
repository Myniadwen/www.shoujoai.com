<h1>When the Shadow and the Hammer Fall (part 2 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bluegrif.html">Blue Griffin</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gundam/shadham-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Later that day, Preventer Commander Lady Une used her pointer to direct
Hilde, Releena, and several other officers&#39; attention to the map at the
front of the room. &quot;Agents Sally Po,&quot; she said, &quot;and Trowa Barton, went
to check out rumors of a possible insurgency in this region.&quot; She
paused, and pointed at the section of the map. &quot;They encountered three
modified Virgo mobile suits, and attempted to open communication. They
received only what they thought was white noise, but a few moments
later, their Peacemaker suits suddenly shut down. Only critical life
support functions were left on-line.&quot;

&#145;So, they&#146;re still working together I see&#146;, Hilde mused. It was one of
the open secrets at Preventer HQ. Sally finally got sick and tired of
Wu-Fei&#146;s condescending attitude towards women and her as well. After all
Sally had done to get the ungrateful S.O.B. in Preventer, he never even
said thank you. Finally, the blond field surgeon woke up and publicly
dumped him, right in the middle of the HQ parking lot. The Chinese
pilot&#146;s rage was unimaginable. Sally was better skilled in hand-to-hand
combat than most, and just as good as some of the very best, but Wu-Fei
was THE best of the best in this field, and the doctor wasn&#146;t going to
be much of a match for him. Before anything could get started however,
Trowa Barton had stepped in between them. After a few blows between
them, the fight was broken up and Wu-Fei was briefly suspended pending a
full psychiatric evaluation. At the same time Trowa and Sally were
assigned together. Partnership turned to respect, then friendship, and
finally into love. There was a betting pool in HQ as to when they would
get married. 

&quot;So the virus was transmitted to the Gundams over the radio,&quot; Hilde said
thoughtfully. Une then shot her an irritated look.

&quot;The Peacemakers aren&#39;t Gundams. No gundanium allow, just similarly
designed,&quot; Une corrected. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Hilde offered. &quot;So what do we know
about the enemy?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re a previously unknown faction of former OZ soldiers,
mercenaries, White Fang members, and ex-soldiers looking for a war who
call themselves &#39;The Ghosts of Valhalla&#146;,&quot; Lady Une said with a stern
look on her noble face. She continued &quot;They have a rather unusual
demand: that Earth&#39;s government reverses the general amnesty offered to
both sides after the war. They want war-crimes trials for White fang
members and OZ soldiers who support the E.S.U.N. as well as the Gundam
pilots.&quot;

Releena looked honestly confused. &quot;But why on Earth would they want
that?&quot; she asked them, surprised.

Une turned to Releena. &quot;You see, because there were no trials, the OZ
soldiers believe that in the eyes of the public all OZ soldiers are
regarded as criminals. In a way, they feel their honor is in question.&quot;

She continued, &quot;If we don&#39;t give in to their demands, they say they will
try to assassinate Releena, who they regard as the primary source of
their troubles.&quot; Une smiled and shrugged. &quot;Hilde, as your bodyguard, and
I have decided to embark on a three stage plan. First, we&#39;ll put a
double in place, second, we remove Releena from the public eye, and
third, we dismantle these so-called &#39;Ghosts&#39;. Hilde, you&#39;re job will be
to move Releena into a secure location and guard her.&quot; Hilde nodded
grimly. Lady Une&#39;s lips twitched, as if she was resisting the urge to
smile &quot;And here&#39;s our Releena double&quot;, who was followed by her braided
boyfriend, Duo Maxwell. 

The young woman walked in wearing Releena&#39;s typical uniform, and a long
brown wig matching Releena&#39;s own hair. But Releena didn&#39;t think she had
ever that dejected a look on her face. &quot;Hello, Catherine&quot; Hilde said,
smiling. Catherine just rolled her eyes. &quot;This is NOT going to work,
people. I don&#146;t even look like Releena.&quot; She then turned to her lover,
&quot;Remind me HOW I got drafted into this DEAR? I&#146;m not even in Preventer.&quot;

&quot;Well babe, you were the one who said you wanted to know what my job was
like,&quot; Duo stated, &quot;aaannnnndd you complained that the circus wasn&#146;t as
exciting as it used to be.&quot;

Cathy sighed, &quot;Remind me to keep my big mouth shut around you.&quot;

Duo offered, &quot;That wouldn&#146;t be any fun. I&#146;d end up being the one doing
most of the talking.&quot;

&quot;So what?&quot; Hilde offered jokingly. &quot;That never stopped you before.&quot;

&quot;Alright, alright knock it off,&quot; Une stated. &quot;Let&#146;s get this thing
started so it can be over and done with.&quot;

As Releena and Hilde left, Releena saw Une walk over to Catherine.
&quot;We&#39;ll try to keep this as short as possible,&quot; Une said to her with big-
sisterly gentleness.

&quot;Thank you very much, ma&#39;am,&quot; Catherine said to her with mock formality.
Une laughed a bit, and rolled her eyes taking a step back, giving
Catherine the opportunity to leave while Duo caught up with Hilde. 

&quot;So, how&#146;s life been treating you &#145;sis&#146;?&quot; Duo said in his usual jovial
manner.

&quot;It&#39;ll be much better when we nail these thugs that have popped up,&quot;
Hilde continued.

&quot;&#145;Sis&#146;?&quot; Releena asked.

&quot;Something of a running gag between us. When we split up, we decided we
were better as friends and the &#145;brother&#146; and &#145;sister&#146; we never had,
being war orphans and all,&quot; Duo answered. 

&quot;I think my future &#145;sister-in-law&#146; is signaling you to get moving,&quot;
Hilde said, pointing to a waving Catherine. 

&quot;Well, duty calls. Catch ya later, ladies!&quot; Duo then trotted off to be
beside his love, giving her a peck on the cheek as they walked off arm
and arm. 

Hilde nodded her head wistfully. &quot;They do make a cute couple don&#146;t
they?&quot;

&quot;I guess it still hurts seeing him with someone else, huh?&quot; Releena
offered sympathetically.

&quot;Nah. Other than sex, we never had all that much in the end. He&#146;s too
irresponsible and I need someone who is more down to Earth&quot;, Hilde
stated. &quot;What he needs is more of a big sister type to take care of him.
Besides, Cathy needs someone to put some laughter in her life and who
better to do that than Duo Maxwell&quot;, she finished with a smirk.</pre>
