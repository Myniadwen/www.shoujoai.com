<h1>Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Revolution (part 12 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gundam/revolution-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Colonel Une watched Juri and Releena step out in the
partial darkness of the roof, a gentle breeze blowing
across the tiled surface. She stood waiting at the far
corner, her brown hair tied back in it&#39;s normal style,
a slim rapier held at the ready. A rose was in her
breast pocket, the color that she had chosen an odd
green.

&quot;I&#39;m glad I picked up the rose from the shop
downstairs,&quot; Juri murmured, holding up the slim orange
flower that matched the color of her long hair.

Releena reached out to gently take it from her, &quot;Let
me.&quot; The brown haired girl slid it into Juri&#39;s pocket,
settling it into place carefully before stepping back,
&quot;There.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Juri smiled.

&quot;Are you ready?&quot; Colonel Une asked as she tried not to
smile, her glasses catrching the moonlight as she
tilted her head back.

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Juri answered.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Une agreed. Without warning she swiftly
raced forward, warily watching how Juri would react to
her attack.

Juri just stood there silently, a dark figure dressed
in black jacket and red pants, calmly waiting for her
strike. &#39;That&#39;s the same style that Tenjou Utena once
wore,&#39; Une thought, &#39;does she see herself in that
role, now?&#39;

Swords rang as they came together, Juri parrying the
first attack with a smooth confidence. She was used to
the rapier, Une could instantly tell, handling the
slim blade&#39;s rapid attacks with easy confidence, the
sword she used nearly dancing.

&quot;Be careful, Juri,&quot; Releena called breathlessly, her
expression fearful.

They seperated a moment, both standing calmly as the
breeze blew around them, Une surprised to find herself
just a bit breathless. &quot;You&#39;re living up to your
reputation, Arisugawa,&quot; she said, meeting those eyes
and seeing a spark of excitement.

&quot;You&#39;re not so bad yourself,&quot; Juri offered, the
slightest of smiles teasing her lips.

Une felt a stab of nervousness, meeting those cool
eyes. &#39;She&#39;s so confident,&#39; Une thought, &#39;sure of her
victory.&#39; Une swept forward, sword flashing as she
tried a complicated series of feints and attacks,
trying to break through the other woman&#39;s guard.

Juri was like water, the sword unable to find it&#39;s
target. She moved her blade so gracefully it almost
became a waltz, turning Une&#39;s attacks aside with a
surprising sort of delicacy. Her footwork was so sure,
her ballance nearly perfect as she moved across the
rooftop, the wind sending her hair swirling around her
shoulders.

&#39;There!&#39; Une lunged for the opening, her sword
flashing.

Juri easily captured her blade, pulling the startled
Une off balance before swiftly striking out once. Une
froze as she felt the tearing, the remains of her rose
dropping in a rain of petals to the rough material of
the roof as she fell to her knees.

&quot;You&#39;re good,&quot; Juri sighed, &quot;but you&#39;re no Miki,
either.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; Releena walked forward, looking at the
two of them nervously.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Juri nodded to Releena with a reassuring smile.
She turned and offered Une her gloved hand as she
asked, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

Une brushed it aside, her own hand shaking slightly as
she fought to regain her selfcontrol. She got to her
feet then met Juri&#39;s eyes as she said, &quot;Well done,
Arisugawa, you won.&quot; She tilted her head back, feeling
oddly bereft as she sighed, &quot;I didn&#39;t expect to lose.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t expect it either when Utena defeated me,&quot;
Juri offered to Une softlly, &quot;but you do get over it,
eventually.&quot; She looked up, the circular space
construct around them dark with the simulated night
and added, &quot;Can we get inside, please?&quot;

Une followed Juri and Releea inside, smiling slightly
as she saw the younger girl take Juri&#39;s arm. Her feet
felt heavy as she took the stairs down, wondering what
she was going to say to Treize about this, how she was
going to tell him. Part of her wanted to be a good
loser, shrug her defeat off, but she couldn&#39;t quite
manage it.

She excused herself then Une returned to her room. Her
brown hair fell into her eyes as she fought back her
tears, rooting through her luggage before she found
what she was looking for. The personal computer was
set up first, then she attached the communications
modules. She took her glasses off, wiping her eyes,
then she set up the connection.

When he came on Treize Khushrenada studied her
intently, his short brown hair styled back. He had
such a presence about him that Une felt her breath
catch, all asgainst her will. He raised an eyebrow, &quot;I
didn&#39;t expect to hear from you so soon.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s been complications,&quot; Une said dryly.

Treize seemed to lean forward, his attention now
subtlely more focused on what she was saying. &quot;Oh?&quot; he
prompted her curiously.

Calmly Une sketched in the details of the explosion at
their first hotel, a third party&#39;s crude attempt at
assassination. She even included details of how
Arisugawa had saved her life, helping pull her to
relative safety. &quot;I felt that carrying through on our
own plans now would be....&quot; she searched for the best
word, &quot;imprudent, at this juncture.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Treize nodded. He looked thoughtful, &quot;We knew
there was a Colony movement interested in a war, but I
didn&#39;t believe they were so well organized.&quot;

&quot;The White Fang,&quot; Une agreed, &quot;a fringe group, though
our inteligence indicates that they do have a powerful
backer, the Barton family.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t know their entire agenda,&quot; Treize mused then
came to a decision. &quot;I want you to protect the
Ambassador and the others, get them back to Earth
safely.&quot;

Une looked surprised, &quot;But our other operations...?&quot;

With a ghost of a smile Treize calmly said, &quot;While I&#39;d
prefer acting boldly, at times caution is also
required.&quot; He studied her a moment, &quot;There&#39;s something
else?&quot;

Une felt a moment of fear but forced herself to say
calmly, &quot;I Dueled with Arisugawa, but was unable to
defeat her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not surprised,&quot; Treize said calmly. When Une
looked at him in surprise as he continued, &quot;Arisugawa
is a dangerous opponent, one that shouldn&#39;t be
underestimated.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Une admitted, &quot;but I regret in acting without
consulting you first, sir.&quot; She took a breath, &quot;I
would hate to disappoint you.&quot;

&quot;You would never disappoint me,&quot; Treize flashed a
smile. With that he signed off, leaving Une to sit
staring at the blank screen.

&quot;I won&#39;t fail you, my love,&quot; Une sighed.

Colonel Une got up from her seat, quickly
dissassembling her communications equipment and
stowing it away. She tidied her uiniform unconsciously
then headed out, moving down the hall to the other&#39;s
room. Une rapped on the door, waiting patiently for an
answer.

Arisugawa Juri opened her bedroom door, blinking at
Une in surprise. She had already undressed, a long
nightgown partially covering her beautiful body.
&quot;Something I can do for you, Colonel?&quot; she asked with
a frown.

Une steeled her will as she quietly said, &quot;I&#39;ve been
ordered to oversee the protection of the Ambassador
and his party.&quot;

Juri snorted her amusement, &quot;Makes me wonder what your
previous orders were.&quot;

Une felt her lips lift slightly in amusement, &#39;She
certainly has me pegged.&#39; Aloud she said, &quot;I hope I&#39;ll
have your cooperation in keeping everyone safe.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got that,&quot; Juri nodded firmly, &quot;though I&#39;m
surprised that you&#39;re standing here asking for my
help, Colonel.&quot;

Une fought back her iritation, biting off the first
thing she wanted to say. &quot;You&#39;re capable, I saw that
when the explosion went off,&quot; Une said coldly. She
paused a moment, &quot;This isn&#39;t over, between us. I will
Duel you again.&quot;

&quot;Ready and waiting for you,&quot; Juri answered calmly as
Une walked away.</pre>
