<h1>Valkyrie (part 11 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/twig.html">Twig</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gundam/valkyrie-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>	&quot;You called me, Zechs?&quot;

	Trowa noticed, as the blonde-haired man turned to face him, that
Zechs was wearing a full dress uniform, and had auspiciously clipped his
former military rank to the corner of one lapel, where it gleamed in plain
view, like a challenge.

	&quot;Trowa.&quot; Zechs paused for a long moment before speaking. &quot;This
conversation never happened.  We never spoke of anything, and when you
went out on assignment, you were acting totally on your own, against all
the wishes of the Sank kingdom.&quot;

	The pilot&#39;s eyes narrowed, he sat down when Zechs gestured to a
chair.

	&quot;Things are getting bad, then?&quot;

	The blonde&#39;s eyes darkened, he flipped through a few papers on the
desk.

	&quot;We&#39;ve managed to deal with the situation in space.  I&#39;ve sent a
lot of men up there to negotiate through the problem, and find a solution
that we can all live with.  God willing, I actually think we&#39;re going to
make it through that one.&quot;  

	He sighed.

	&quot;The bullet wasn&#39;t meant for Relena.  We know that now.  But our
investigation has uncovered other problems - situations the dominant
political majority in that kingdom doesn&#39;t want us to know about. 
Espionage, human rights violations in just about every form you can think
of... it&#39;s bad.  We should have gotten involved when the minor faction
asked for our help.  We should not have declared our indifference.&quot;

	&quot;The Sank kingdom is a nation founded on peace.  To involve
yourself in a war in any way is to dilute and destroy your principles. 
Relena said that herself.&quot;

	&quot;Relena isn&#39;t here.&quot;  Zechs sighed.  &quot;And I can&#39;t take her place. 
I&#39;ve known all my life, that I can&#39;t be the torchbearer for Absolute
Pacifism.&quot;

	Zechs looked just a little scared, honestly frightened by the
responsibility on his shoulders now.  It was one thing when he hadn&#39;t had
to answer to anyone, but now, he was taking over his sister&#39;s job.
	
&quot;We have to find her, Trowa.  Relena would find a way to solve this, and
it would not be the path I take, the only one I can seem to see clearly.&quot; 


He took a deep breath before speaking again.

&quot;They&#39;re going to attack us, because they think we&#39;re vulnerable now, that
with Relena gone, no one will come to our aid.	I can&#39;t allow my sister to
come back to a broken country, to have her see the Sank reduced to ash.&quot;

He quietly handed the pilot a photograph, didn&#39;t look at him while
speaking.

&quot;I want you to take your Gundam, and destroy this base.  It&#39;s the closest
weapons depot to our borders, and if we take it out now, it will be much
easier to defend against them.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re launching the first offensive strike.&quot;

Zechs chuckled.

&quot;Call it pre-emptive defense.&quot;

Trowa studied the picture, and nodded.

&quot;I understand.	Relena would not allow this... but I agree, that now we
have no choice.&quot;

&quot;All other forces will still be deployed, searching for her, until we find
her.  As soon as Relena is back, I am /sure/ she can negotiate a peaceful
end.  The Gundams, the soldiers... they&#39;re all out there looking.  And
Heero.	Catalonia can&#39;t hide from us forever.&quot;

Zechs&#39; voice lost the nobility of a leader on the last few words, and was
undercut with the anguish of a confused, worried brother.  Trowa reached
out, grabbed the man&#39;s arm in a quiet gesture of support.

&quot;We&#39;ll find her.  We&#39;ll get through this.&quot;

Zechs nodded, and Trowa turned away.

&quot;Trowa?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;
	
&quot;I know Quatre&#39;s going to accompany you, no matter how much I would like
to keep this a secret from everyone.  Tell him it&#39;s okay, so that he
doesn&#39;t hyperventilate from the stress of breaking orders, and just try to
keep your eye on him.&quot;

Trowa chuckled, a soft sound that barely broke the tension of the air, and
walked out the door.

&quot;I always do.&quot;

----------------------------

Relena woke up thinking about Dorothy&#39;s touch, Dorothy&#39;s mouth, Dorothy&#39;s
eyes. Her thoughts refused to stray despite all her best efforts, and she
couldn&#39;t even meet the other girl&#39;s eyes until she was eating breakfast,
using the food as a way to distract herself from thinking about... other
things.

//Not that it&#39;s working.//

Relena had never, in her entire life, thought about girls the way she had
thought about boys.  She had never thought she wouldn&#39;t end up with a
husband and a family, only dating boys, only marrying boys.

//Boys?  What boys?  There was always Heero.  Just Heero.//

It wasn&#39;t that there hadn&#39;t been other people asking.  In fact, there had
been both boys and girls who had taken a more than obvious interest in her
over the past few years. 

 Relena had never minded the attention from the girls, she had always
thought it took so much of an open mind to believe in Absolute Pacifism
that there was little else she could discriminate against.  How could she
possibly worry about who was sleeping with whom, when she was trying to
stop mankind from self-destructing?

//I love the person I love.  Not because they&#39;re male or female, but
because I love them.  That&#39;s it.//

It did bring up another interesting question, however.	Did she love
Dorothy?  

The blonde girl was, by anyone&#39;s standards, very beautiful, and could act
up any part, be it soldier or debutante, at the drop of a hat.	Relena had
no doubt that the only reason she had found the blonde out was because
Dorothy /wanted/ to be found.

//Always teasing, always ready to start a fight.  Always playing those
dangerous games, until now.  Now, she tells me she&#39;s the enemy, or close
enough, but that she loves me.	She /loves/ me.//

Relena wanted to believe so much her heart ached.  She longed for someone
to be close to, someone who would hold her and cherish her, someone she
could cherish in return.  She knew, deep down, that Heero cared, but it
simply wasn&#39;t enough anymore, she needed someone to be there for her
/now/.	There had never been anyone like that, never in her whole life,
and now Dorothy truly wanted to be that person?

It was frightening.  The same touch Relena wanted also filled her with
nervous dread, and anxiety.  She had been trained to speak eloquently, she
had been given years of practice to learn to argue, to be Dorothy&#39;s foil,
to be the person the blonde wanted to be around.  Relena had none of that
same familiarity with love, with emotions, with anything... physical.

//I&#39;m not a prude.  I can tell dirty jokes with the best of them.  Hell,
I&#39;ve even taken on Duo before and /almost/ won.//  

She couldn&#39;t help but grin, remembering that night. 

//I think I may have even given Quatre a nosebleed.  But... but it&#39;s not
the same. I really don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing.  At least with Heero, I
thought he was probably as inexperienced as me - then again, how would I
know?//

Her stomach started hurting again, nerves quivering with tension and
strain.  Relena refused to show any of it outwardly, determined to work it
out on her own.

//Dorothy won&#39;t want to hear it.  She&#39;ll think I&#39;m an idiot.  Real adults
don&#39;t have these kinds of issues.  They just - they just /do/ it.  But...
but I... I don&#39;t even know where my /hands/ go!  How stupid does that
sound?	At least with Heero, it would have been easier.  &#39;Insert tab A
into slot B, thrust, repeat.&#39; Or so Duo said once, when he was completely
wasted on margaritas.  I think I remember Hilde knocking him off his chair
for /that/ one.//

Relena repeatedly stabbed the large amount of uneaten crepes on her plate,
her stare nearly boring a hole through the floral-print dishware.

//Dorothy... she&#39;s been my first kiss, my first /everything/.  What will
she think of me, when she realizes I don&#39;t understand?	That I don&#39;t... I
can&#39;t... //

The brunette knew exactly what would happen.  Dorothy would reject her
outright, and completely, without a second thought.  The world was not a
place that tolerated lousy lovers.

------------------------

&quot;Relena.  Whatever the crepes did to you, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re sorry for it by
now.&quot;

The blonde&#39;s tone was dryly sarcastic.	Relena noticed she now had only
shreds of breakfast left on her plate, a uniform pile of crumbs no bigger
than flecks of fish food.

&quot;Oh.  Sorry, I&#39;m... just thinking.&quot;  Relena sighed.

//Idiot.  Idiot.  You&#39;re never going to be able to live up to her
fantasies... you can&#39;t be who she expects you to be, who she thinks you
are.  Stupid, you are so, so stupid.//

&quot;You look tense, Relena.  That&#39;s exactly what I was trying to avoid here. 
Let&#39;s go to the beach.	I know this wonderful cove, it&#39;s very private.&quot;

Relena nodded, trying to avoid the other girl&#39;s gaze, hoping that the
sunlight and the cool, ocean air would refresh her, give her some new
ideas, help her save herself from a future that looked desperately grim.

//Oh, Relena... it&#39;s /so/ hot. Would you put some sunscreen on my back?//

The brunette groaned, resisting the urge to pound her head against the
wall.

//Why me? Why oh why /me/?//

----------------------------

The beach was absolutely beautiful, tiny but serene, and completely
deserted.  Dorothy parked The Car around a bend, and the two girls walked
back towards the small cove, the light filtering down through the trees
along the path.
  
Relena was enraptured by the sound of the ocean, the cry of a few
seagulls, the sight of the brilliant light sand contrasted with the deep
blue waves.  The sensations of the past few days seemed so much sharper
and clearer than almost the rest of her life.  She had never felt so
alive, and free.
	
&quot;It&#39;s so beautiful.  I can&#39;t believe there aren&#39;t more people here.&quot;

	&quot;There probably will be, later in the day.  However, I did choose
an isolated beach, near an isolated town, in an isolated part of the
world.	Maybe there won&#39;t be anyone.&quot;

	Relena paused, staring at the blonde for a moment.

	&quot;You really put some time into this abduction plan, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

	Dorothy merely smiled and walked past her, refusing to answer.

	They stepped off the dirt path, onto the sand, and walked toward
the shore.  A ways off from the water, Relena stopped, staring at the
waves for a moment before taking off her shirt and shorts, revealing a
conservative, navy one-piece suit.

	&quot;/That&#39;s/ what I waited all this time to see?&quot;	Dorothy teased,
clucking her tongue.

	&quot;I&#39;m not the one who insisted I buy this thing in private.  You&#39;re
the one who wanted to keep it a surprise.&quot; Relena frowned at the blonde,
staring down.  &quot;Besides... it&#39;s modest, and navy is classic.&quot;

	&quot;You&#39;re right, of course, Relena.&quot; 

Dorothy&#39;s voice was as demure as always, but her eyes were also as sly as
ever.
	
As Relena threw out her towel, watching it unfold in the wind, Dorothy
slowly stepped out of her clothes.  Relena turned, and her jaw dropped,
eyes widening in complete surprise.

	&quot;What /is/ that?!&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s a bathing suit, Miss Relena.&quot;

	&quot;No.&quot;
  
Relena shook her head, eyes wide in honest shock.  

&quot;That&#39;s two 3-by-5 cards and some dental floss.  Maybe a little bit of
tape, but /no/ suit.&quot; 

The brunette couldn&#39;t help but feel a little jealous admiration. Not even
the most costly of dares could have gotten her into the suit Dorothy was
wearing.  

//Barely wearing.//

The tiny white bikini and thong bottom combination could have fit in the
palm of her hand with room to spare.  Dorothy looked down at her suit for
a moment, and shrugged, not seeing any problem with it.

&quot;I don&#39;t know why I bothered, actually.&quot;

&quot;Huh?  What do you mean?&quot;

Dorothy stretched out serenely, the long curve of her neck just barely
visible as she titled her face up to the sun.  Her hair spilled back over
her shoulders like a blonde waterfall.

&quot;Didn&#39;t I tell you about this beach?  It&#39;s clothing optional.&quot;

Relena had to pick her jaw up off of the ground, as Dorothy calmly
stripped off the tiny suit, and ran buck naked into the sea.

-------------------------

//Something is wrong again. Not with the Sank, not Heero.  This time, it&#39;s
something else.//

Dorothy stretched out, kicking her legs up in the air as she dove beneath
the waves.  She loved the feel of the sea on her bare skin, the way the
gentle current rocked her, the quiet silence just under the surface.  It
immediately centered her, making it easy to think clearly, which she
definitely needed to do right now.

Whatever the problem was, it had started early that morning, and hadn&#39;t
left Relena&#39;s thoughts since then.  The girl looked preoccupied, and every
time she looked up at Dorothy, there was /something/ in her gaze.  The
blonde couldn&#39;t decipher it, and that worried her more than anything else.


//You know what /you&#39;re/ so worried about.  What if she&#39;s /not/ interested
in you?  You just assumed... because she didn&#39;t tell you no at the first
kiss, that she must be more than willing to do whatever you want.  But a
kiss can take someone off guard, and I&#39;d bet that Relena never got much
practice saying yes or no before this.//

Dorothy sighed, stretching out in the water.  It was going to be nigh
impossible to stop herself now, not this time.	This was the best chance
she had ever had, and might /ever/ get, to turn this friendship into
something more.

The blonde stared up into the sky, floating on her back, hair drifting on
the water around her, looking more like a mermaid than an earthly
creature. She closed her eyes, letting all her thoughts go, hoping that
the last thought out of her brain would be the one to tell her what to do.


Before Dorothy could think, a hand wrapped around her ankle, and pulled
her under the surface.	The blonde came up gasping and spluttering, to the
sound of delighted giggling.

Relena was laughing, shaking her head, almost in tears.
&quot;If... if you only knew how long I&#39;ve w-waited... to /finally/ catch you
off guard, D-dorothy!  It&#39;s - it&#39;s...&quot;

She was laughing too hard to continue the sentence, and Dorothy&#39;s eyebrows
arched in surprise and her own delight, as the crest of a wave passed by
them, the water lowered, and she realized what Relena /wasn&#39;t/ wearing.

&quot;Those are some very powerful waves, hm, Relena?&quot;

Relena stopped laughing, gazing down with a deep blush in her cheeks.

&quot;I... uh, er... when in Rome?&quot;

The brunette stopped blushing as Dorothy took advantage of her pause, and
started splashing her with water.  Relena yelped in delight, madly
splashing back, and a fierce water war started between them.

&quot;What about Absolute Pacifism, Relena?	Wouldn&#39;t it be better to talk this
out?&quot;

&quot;You wish, blondie!&quot;

With a wild cry of joy, Relena abandoned the inferior water delivery
method, and instead just pounced on the blonde, plunging them both beneath
the surface.  It wasn&#39;t until they were under the water, and she felt
Dorothy bump against the sandy bottom, felt the smooth flesh press against
her hand, that she remembered that neither of them was wearing a suit.

//... oh dear.//

Relena quickly stood up, moved back slightly, to give the other girl some
room.

&quot;Uh, Dorothy... I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot;

Dorothy chuckled and slowly rose, until she was standing, and the brunette
was struck breathless, all words vanishing in a heartbeat. 

Relena could see the drops of water falling from the blonde&#39;s fingertips,
trickling down the curves of her body, the ends of her nipples, like
molten diamonds in slow motion.  Dorothy shone, backlit by the water
gleaming off the sea, and her hair lay in a flat and sculpted curve of
blonde marble, making her beautiful gray-blue eyes only that much larger,
her entire being just that much more a work of art.
	
Relena couldn&#39;t speak, didn&#39;t want to, most of her senses sizzling, too
shocked to function, as Dorothy carefully approached her.  The blonde
wrapped one arm tightly around her waist, and kissed her.

	The kiss lasted, and lasted, the brunette could barely breathe in
the spaces in between, suddenly feeling no fear, furiously interested now,
/needing/ to feel the other girl&#39;s touch on her skin, to pull Dorothy as
close as she could.

	//I need you, Dorothy, I want you.//

	The water swirled around them, both girls had been pulled back by
the current, deeper into the ocean. Relena barely noticed, couldn&#39;t
believe she wasn&#39;t /flying/, enraptured with the feeling of the other
girl&#39;s slick skin, the way Dorothy murmured with ecstasy as Relena let her
nails slide across her waist, down her thigh.

	&quot;Relena...&quot; Dorothy held the last letter in her throat, letting
the word dissolve into a purr of happiness, burying her head against the
brunette&#39;s neck, gently kissing the curve between shoulder and spine.

	Relena nearly froze, as an intense wave of fluttery pleasure
flooded her whole body.  Hearing that sly voice whisper her name, without
any title, without pretense, simply passion, was something she had never
known she wanted so badly.
	
&quot;Say it again, Dorothy.  Please...say my name.&quot;

	Dorothy chuckled, glad to give pleasure so simply, so easily.
		
&quot;Relena... Relena Peacecraft.  My Relena.&quot;

	The brunette lost herself in Dorothy&#39;s kiss, the tongue that moved
so skillfully inside of her mouth, teasing her, easily giving as much as
she took, and promising more.  Relena felt awkward with desire, mind
whirling as she tried to reciprocate, testing the body under her hands,
the mouth on her own, trying to remember what to do, to think of how she
could let the blonde know what she was feeling, how much she wanted the
girl&#39;s touch.
	
//So good, this is so good, Dorothy.  Thank you.//
  
Her singular focus shattered, shivered into oblivion as Dorothy&#39;s hand
slowly slid between her legs, and skillful fingers started coaxing a
growing, deliciously powerful sensation free from inside of her.
	
&quot;Dorothy...&quot; 
	
Relena gasped, and then moaned softly, pressing her face against the other
girl&#39;s neck, feeling her muscles tense, the feeling expanding, pulsing
with increasing urgency.  She trembled with excitement at the blonde
girl&#39;s low, satisfied chuckle.	The brunette tilted her head back...
	
...and swallowed about a gallon of seawater, as a large wave dropped
directly on her head.
	
Dorothy let go of her immediately, the unseen wave coming down on her as
well.  

Relena broke the surface of the water coughing and hacking, rubbing the
water out of her eyes, almost screaming in frustration as her wet hair
quickly dropped down, and more water replaced what she had tried to wipe
away.  It was a small problem she could focus on, the larger interruption
was too much for her to handle.  
	
Dorothy was in hysterics, but tried to gain control as she saw Relena&#39;s
wounded look.
	
&quot;I&#39;m sorry  Relena.  You look like a drowned cat!  It&#39;s just - it&#39;s just
so /funny/.&quot;

	&quot;You did that.	I just know it.&quot;  

Relena pouted, and felt the desire rekindle inside of her, uncurl in her
stomach as Dorothy regarded her with that sly gaze, and swam up to her,
brushing a kiss across her cheek.

&quot;Relena, I may be somewhat well connected, but even I cannot move the
tides.&quot;  

The blonde took her hand, slowly walking back toward the beach.  Relena
didn&#39;t ask if Dorothy had finished with her, if the sudden intrusion of
the ocean had broken the mood completely.  She was afraid again, and
unsure whether it was that Dorothy /had/ finished, or that she had just
begun.

//That was... well, that was definitely everything Duo seems to be fixated
on.  It was...// 

Even Relena&#39;s thoughts paused, breathlessly. 

//It was good as he said.  Very good, and fun. But... I don&#39;t know... am I
doing it right?  What if... what if I do something wrong?//

She didn&#39;t feel in control of her body, as Dorothy led her to the beach,
pulled on her hand to sit her down. The blonde started to kiss her again,
slowly moving closer, until they were laying completely on Relena&#39;s
blanket, legs twined, Dorothy on top of her, nibbling gently on her ear. 
The brunette&#39;s panic overwhelmed any other emotion, and she knew she was
being horribly clumsy in returning any affection.

//I don&#39;t know what to do... what if I do something wrong... what do I do?
 What do I do?//

&quot;Relena...&quot;

She blinked, as Dorothy pulled back, rolling to lean on her hand, staring
at her.  The brunette couldn&#39;t read Dorothy&#39;s gaze, but felt her cheeks
burn with shame nonetheless.

&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry, Dorothy.&quot;

-------------------------

//If she says she wants to go back to Heero... I swear, I&#39;ll shoot
myself.//

Dorothy didn&#39;t understand why Relena had suddenly become so tense, what
had changed in the minutes between the sea and the sand.

//Wonderful. Relena, you... you are so wonderful. I don&#39;t think I could
ever want anyone but you... and I don&#39;t think I could give you up... not
now.//

Dorothy didn&#39;t have the words to justify that statement to herself, but
she didn&#39;t need them.  Feelings were enough, and what she felt for the
girl lying beside her transcended everything else.

&quot;Relena.  Please.  Tell me what you&#39;re thinking.  Tell me what&#39;s bothering
you.  Did I do something wrong?&quot;

&quot;No!  Oh no, you didn&#39;t do anything.&quot;
  
Relena shook her head fervently.  Satisfied that it wasn&#39;t her touch that
was the problem, Dorothy slid her hand across the other girl&#39;s stomach,
felt Relena shiver slightly underneath her touch.

&quot;Problem?&quot;

&quot;It... just tickles a little.&quot;	

Dorothy heard something disturbingly sad in that statement, as if Relena
had somehow done something wrong, merely for being ticklish.  

The brunette frowned, and took a deep breath.  She choked halfway through,
just for a moment, and the desperate, half-sob hung in the air between
them.

&quot;I just... I think I&#39;m going to disappoint you, Dorothy.  I don&#39;t, I&#39;ve
never...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a virgin.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s /more/ than that.&quot;  Relena wailed, pounding one clenched fist into
the sand.  &quot;It&#39;s so much more than that.  I&#39;ve never - All the things
you... you like about me, they took me /years/.  Years of work, years of
dedication and study and practice.  I don&#39;t know how to kiss, or where to
touch, or what to do.  I can&#39;t, I don&#39;t think...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re afraid.&quot;

Relena paused for a long moment, and nodded with her eyes closed.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to disappoint you, Dorothy.  Duo&#39;s the encyclopedia, I&#39;m
merely the dictionary, I know the terms, but nothing more than that.  I
/know/ things. I&#39;m not a complete innocent, but I can&#39;t /do/ anything - 
and I don&#39;t think I can be who you want me to be.&quot;

Dorothy blinked, completely surprised.	Out of all the things she would
have imagined Relena saying, this one was near the bottom of the pile.

//How?	How could you think you&#39;d disappoint me? That I expect anything
from you, except you.//

&quot;What... /who/ do you think I want, Relena?&quot;

Relena sighed, averting her gaze when she realized Dorothy really wanted
an answer.

&quot;I... I don&#39;t know.  Someone more mature... someone more experienced. Duo
said once...&quot;

&quot;Now I can tell you, I /don&#39;t/ want Duo Maxwell.&quot; Dorothy murmured wryly,
relieved to hear Relena chuckle.

&quot;Did you ever think that people might... overemphasize their conquests,
Relena?  That they might exaggerate, just a little?&quot;

&quot;What?	Even Duo?&quot;  Relena grinned, voice dripping with sarcasm.

&quot;Yeah.	Definitely Duo.&quot;

//Relena.  My shy, perfect, beautiful... I never thought you&#39;d be nervous
like this.  I love it, and I love you so much more for telling me.  Giving
me your heart like this.//

She couldn&#39;t wait any longer, couldn&#39;t help the way her heart overflowed,
with the knowledge that she could make the brunette happy, she would take
all those fears away, that this was a problem /she/ could solve.

&quot;Dorothy?&quot;  Relena murmured as the blonde-haired girl moved closer,
brought a hand up to stroke her face, dragging a fingertip down the side
of the brunette&#39;s neck.

&quot;You could /never/ disappoint me, Relena.  I didn&#39;t fall for you because
of who I thought you were hiding, for the sexy creature I thought you
might be under the surface.  You are so /incredibly/ seductive, just by
being you.  I love you for you, I wouldn&#39;t want to be with anyone else. 
Believe me.&quot;
	
---------------------------

Dorothy moved much slower this time, Relena&#39;s body pressed warm and soft
against her own, the sun and wind providing the perfect setting, the
perfect opportunity.
	
Relena knew the blonde was more cautious now, taking her time with each
kiss, making sure she was ready, that she felt comfortable and secure.
	
The brunette had noticed something, had noticed everything, but her mind
had picked up a few choice details that she thought could help her.  While
her own breasts were not that sensitive, never had been, each time
Relena&#39;s hand brushed across Dorothy&#39;s chest, the other girl shivered
slightly, in what seemed like uncontrollable delight.
	
//I wonder.  I wonder if she would mind, if I should...//
	
Relena let the idea rattle in her mind for a few moments, and then just
threw caution to the wind, and went for it.  

Dorothy had been kissing her as the idea formed in her head, and parted
with a slight sound of confusion as Relena pushed her back slightly.
	
&quot;Mm... what&#39;s wrong?  Relen - oh /god/.&quot;

Dorothy&#39;s hands fisted tightly in the beach blanket, all her muscles
instantly tensing at the rush of sweet, hot pleasure, the feeling of the
brunette&#39;s mouth on the swell of her breast.
	
&quot;Oh god, Relena...&quot; The blonde couldn&#39;t think, couldn&#39;t move, only lay
there and beg for more, the tongue gently caressing her nipple, sucking
softly, and biting, just slightly, as Dorothy&#39;s whimpers of desire reached
their peak.

	//Oh Relena, how in the hell did you ever think you weren&#39;t any
good at this?//

	&quot;Mmm... oh no, don&#39;t stop, don&#39;t /ever/ - please, Relena...&quot;

	On top of the physical pleasure, Dorothy&#39;s thoughts were singing
out in joy, because she knew Relena was happy, relieved that she was doing
something the blonde wanted, that Dorothy was pleased.

	&quot;I hope you... realize, Relena&quot; she gasped, as Relena&#39;s mouth
finally stopped its exquisite torture, tilted up to encounter hers again.
&quot;... that this isn&#39;t as difficult as you thought it would be.&quot;
	
&quot;I tend to overreact.&quot;
 
	The matter of fact statement nearly made the blonde scream with
laughter.

&quot;Well, that&#39;s all over.&quot; Dorothy murmured dryly. &quot;I was told it&#39;s like
learning how to ride a bike.  Once you learn, you don&#39;t forget.&quot;

Relena chuckled, the half-nervous passion crumbling the laughter into tiny
bits, and closed her eyes in sheer bliss as Dorothy gently massaged the
curve of her back, slid her hand down to the back of her thigh.

&quot;... ah.  Ah, Dorothy...I think - I think I&#39;m going to explode.&quot;

Dorothy was sure she was purring, completely filled with happiness as
Relena now writhed under her touch, making soft noises as she stroked the
blonde&#39;s arms and legs, anything she could touch with the ends of her
fingertips, craving more.

&quot;Oh, really?&quot;

The blonde curled a hand around the back of Relena&#39;s neck for a moment,
letting her fingers trail unhindered as her kisses slowly, delicately
trailed a course lower and lower on the brunette&#39;s body.  She felt the
moment Relena realized what she was doing, like an electric shock through
her body, and felt the other girl&#39;s hand twining deep in her long, blonde
hair.

&quot;Mm... ahh.  I don&#39;t know, Dorothy, I don&#39;t...know.&quot;

&quot;Shh.  I&#39;ll be gentle, and it&#39;s only fair.  It&#39;s my turn.&quot;

Relena&#39;s words soon disappeared completely, replaced by gasps, quiet
whimpers and moans, as Dorothy&#39;s lips moved lower, and deeper into her
body.

The blonde had to admit, the wry thought springing up as Relena cried out,
she got some of her biggest thrills from hearing the noises her lovers
made.

//Lover.  Singular.  Okay... you had a lot of fun with it, a /lot/, but up
until this point, that cadet out in space had been /it/.//

She smiled to herself.

//...and you have the gall to tell Relena that everyone /else/ lies about
their bedroom prowess.//

Dorothy hadn&#39;t even thought about it, but telling the brunette that she
wasn&#39;t as experienced as Relena must have thought she was would have
probably been a good thing to do at the beginning.

//Although,// She thought wryly, hearing Relena gasp again.  //I think
now, the &#39;stage fright&#39; has worn off.//

The blonde absolutely relished the sounds she could bring out in her
partner, with the right touch, the right amount of pressure and timing.  

Relena didn&#39;t disappoint her, gladly rewarding Dorothy with any noise she
wanted, as long as the blonde took her time searching for it.  In some
ways, Dorothy thought, it was similar to learning how to master an
instrument, or fight in a duel.

//...and will I ever even think of saying /that/ one out loud to her?  I
don&#39;t think so.//

Dorothy let the intensity build slowly, eventually feeling the other
girl&#39;s movements, her reactions as if they were no longer separate beings,
but one person, moving along the same passion in near-perfect union.  

The blonde relished the long moment of connection, an unbroken loop of
pure bliss.  She followed, as the brunette shuddered past the rhythm, and
there was too much, too much to contain it all in any one sound or
movement.

Relena cried out loudly, back arched, shuddering furiously as she came,
and Dorothy was surprised to find she was trembling too.

//Relena.//
 
The brown-haired girl slowly drew Dorothy back up with one hand, moving
close to her in the wonderful moments just after the peak, and they
drifted together in the slowly receding warm waves of pleasure.  

Dorothy basked in the feel of Relena&#39;s soft, hot skin against hers, the
girl&#39;s scent, which now seemed to have soaked into her every pore.  A few
strands of still-damp hair clung to her side, and she could see that some
of Relena&#39;s long brown strands had entwined with a few of her blonde ones.
 The sight brought nothing but peace, contentment, and joy.   

There was nothing she could say to make things any more perfect, no
serious words to enhance the moment, and so Dorothy turned to comedy
instead.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know you were a screamer.&quot;  The blonde murmured, kissing the
other girl&#39;s cheek.

Relena slid closer to her, giggling just a little, making sure they were
still well tangled together in the remaining space on the beach blanket.

&quot;Me neither.&quot;

There was no reason to move, Dorothy thought, no reason to do anything
except lay in the sun, drenched in the sun and in Relena.  

She knew the other girl had simply forgotten that this was, technically, a
public beach, and Dorothy felt no need to mention the men she had posted a
half-mile each way on the road leading to the cove, to make sure their
privacy remained private.  

The brunette amused herself by toying slightly with strands of the
blonde&#39;s long, thick hair, while Dorothy slowly stroked the skin just
above Relena&#39;s navel, and listened to the sound of her lover&#39;s heartbeat.

//My lover, mine.  It&#39;s all real.  This is really real.//

&quot;You make me so happy, Relena.&quot;

The brunette kissed her forehead, curled one arm around her.

&quot;I love you, Dorothy.&quot;

Gently entwined, nestled in the sand with the sound of the sea all around
them, the two girls fell asleep and dreamed of each other, and a future
that stretched out before them like paradise.
