<h1>When All the Stars Were Falling</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a>

<pre>~~When all the stars were falling, 
I reached up like you said.
All the stars were falling,
one hit me in the head,
and I fell down, down, down.
I fell down, down.~~

I looked out of the window, thinking thoughts that surely weren&#39;t my 
own. Does she love me? Does she know I even exsist? The rain was 
letting up, and the stars were out, and I almost could hear the church 
bells. I glanced at my watch. Midnight, and all is well. I should go 
to bed.

I didn&#39;t, though. In the window, I could see my reflection, and I 
imagined it was her. I suppose lack of sleep can make you think 
strange things. Her violet eyes watched me as I cast my own eyes to 
the street. Surely Duo would be home soon? He was always out, whether 
partying, or something calmer, he was a night owl. It always amazed me 
how he could survive on about three hours of sleep a night. But then, 
I was doing the same thing, but I wasn&#39;t out having fun. I was home, 
dreaming of purple eyes.

~~When all the stars were falling, 
they fell from above
and I thought of hate, and I thought of hate, 
and then I thought of love. 
and I fell down, down, down, I fell down, down.~~

Things were so strange now, now that the war is over. She lives with 
her brother, in an apartment only three blocks away. I know, because I 
had walked outside her window on occasion. Okay, I did it a lot. I 
would see her there sometimes. Brushing her hair, reading, laughing at 
something an unseen person said or did. I watched her and wished I 
could be there with her, but of course, I couldn&#39;t. 

She is beautiful, wonderful, but she&#39;d never understand. How could 
she? Who am I to her? The love that surrounds us both was born on the 
edge of death, and the boys hold each other so tightly, as if one 
might be gone at any second. Even the freindships around me make my 
feelings for her seem shoddy. Like glass next to a diomand. I&#39;m just 
the kid who lives down the street. That freind of her brother&#39;s 
friend.

Oh, what a pick me up this night was turning out to be.

~~And I&#39;ve learned how to dance from a Vincent Van Gogh, 
and the nights were wrapped in a white sheet, 
and now no one even says hello,
&#39;cause I couldn&#39;t stand on my two feet
I fell down
I fell down. ~~

Duo appeared in the window, two stories below me. He was with someone. 
Is that a....? It was. It was a girl. Duo&#39;s never brought a girl home 
before... Be kind, girl. He&#39;s never brought *anyone* home but Heero. 
The pair on the street disappeared into the building below her, and 
she looked about the room she was in. Good enough for company, I 
guess. There were a few of Duo&#39;s mangas lieing around, but nothing too 
discusting. 

Moments later, the door opened. Duo stood there, next to a very 
nervous... 

&quot;Cathrine?&quot; I squeeked, and wished I had just kept my mouth shut. 

&quot;Hey, Hilde, kid, I brought you home something.&quot; Duo said cheerfully, 
then took his leave of the room. 

~~Now the peace you will find, in your own you have found, 
the lights of the city are the stars on the ground. 
&quot;I may not be a quaalude living in a speed zone,&quot; 
But I could be restful, I could be someone&#39;s home, 
if I fell down, ~~

&quot;Hello.&quot; Cathrine finally said, and I did my best not to gape. God, 
this was hard. My brain seemed to be nothing but mush. &quot;Duo... um... I 
have to...&quot; The brown haired girl took a breath and tried to continue. 
&quot;I wanted to tell you...er...ask if...&quot;

Duo swept out of the next room. Without a word, he pushed us together, 
then fashioned our arms in an embrace. Then he walked right back out. 

My mind was compleate fluff now. She smelled like vanilla, and the 
expression on her face was one of confused delight. Could she have 
been as delighted as I was to be in each other&#39;s arms? She frowned 
briefly, then closed her eyes. 

To my absolute astonishment, she pressed her lips to mine, timid. I 
encouraged her by responding. The kiss was sweet and brief, sweet 
because I think I could hear us both thinking ...finally. Brief only 
because Duo was snikering behind us. I just smiled at him, and led 
this beautiful angel past him to my room. 

~~and I fell down, down. ~~
