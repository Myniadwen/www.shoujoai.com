&quot;Relena! Where the hell are we going?&quot;Hilde shrieked as she stumbled 
on something. She heard a giggle and inwardly groaned. That could 
never mean a good thing. 

&quot;No way I&#39;m going to tell koi! You&#39;ll find out when we get there!&quot;

Hilde was about to protest when she felt warm lips on hers, 
successfully quieting her as she kissed the sandy blonde back.

Relena pulled away.

&quot;Will you be quiet now?&quot; the politician asked, and Hilde nodded. 

************************

After a plane trip, which contained MUCH cuddling, Relena led the 
German girl out of the building, and loaded her into a car. 

Hilde guessed it was a jeep, because there were bar-like things around 
her and the wind whipped freely through her hair. 

After ten minutes or so, they stopped, and Relena ran to Hilde&#39;s side 
and helped the girl out. After wrapping her arms around the blue 
haired girl&#39;s waist, the diplomat continued on their little trip.

I hope she likes this Relena thought nervously, looking at Hilde as 
she sniffed the air for any hints of their location. After much 
planning, Relena had found the perfect spot to go to for a vacation. 

&quot;Relena...&quot;the German girl stammered, &quot;Just tell me--&quot;

&quot;Hilde...&quot;Relena warned, &quot;Be patient. We&#39;re almost there.&quot;

Hilde heard something mechanical move, than walked forward to feel a 
wave of cool air wash over her, slightly ruffling her hair. 

Her blindfold was then removed, and she gasped.

Off the Florida Keys
There&#39;s a place called Kokomo
That&#39;s where you wanna go to get away from it all That dreamy look in 
your eye
Give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo

The couple sat together, Hilde sat comfortably in her lover&#39;s lap. 

Her eyes widened and brightened as the sun peeked over the horizon of 
the ocean.

Relena rested her head on the German&#39;s shoulder as she watched with a 
serene smile on her face. 

&quot;Look! Look!&quot; Hilde cried like a young child looking at a new toy, 
pointing, &quot;Isn&#39;t it amazing?!&quot;

Relena nodded, smiling at the blue haired girl&#39;s excitement. 

Aruba, Jamaica ooo I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego baby why don&#39;t we go

Ooo I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We&#39;ll get there fast
And then we&#39;ll take it slow
That&#39;s where we wanna go
Way down to Kokomo

&quot;Ok,&quot; Relena sighed, looking at the map again, &quot;If we follow this blue 
line we&#39;ll make it to the red line and move down that one to the 
hotel!&quot;

She looked around the forest they had been in for the whole day, proud 
of her navigating skills.

Hilde sweatdropped.

&quot;Uhhh Relena, give me the map now.&quot;

Everybody knows
A little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go
And get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo

&quot;Well, I think it&#39;s pretty,&quot;Hilde smiled. Relena nodded.

&quot;Lighthouses are quite pretty.&quot;

Suddenly a bright light flashed in Hilde&#39;s eyes and she yelped, waving 
her arms around as she jumped back from it, leaning too far over the 
railing.

&quot;AHHHHH!&quot; she yelled. Two arms wrapped around her, but she was too 
scared to hear the soothing words her lover was saying to her.

Her arm smacked into Relena&#39;s face as she continued to struggle.

&quot;HILDE! STOP IT!&quot; the blonde yelled, trying to keep a hold of the 
falling girl.

&quot;AHHHHHHHH!!!&quot;

&quot;HILDE!&quot;

Aruba, Jamaica ooo I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego baby why don&#39;t we go

Hilde sat on the balcony&#39;s railing, sighing as the sun rose above the 
horizon. 

They were leaving today, their week of vacation was coming to a close. 
She had enjoyed it so much, and felt much closer to her koi. 

She looked back at the slumbering Relena, who was lightly snoring. 

She went through so much Hilde thought I&#39;ll have to make it up to her 
somehow...but how..?

You could cover yourself in chocolate and in whipcream write 
&#39;thankyou&#39;

Hilde gave a smirk close to the Grinch&#39;s. That would be fun. As the 
young girl plotted the surprise, the sun rose completely, bathing her 
in warmth.

Ooo I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We&#39;ll get there fast
And then we&#39;ll take it slow
That&#39;s where we wanna go
Way down to Kokomo

Relena and Hilde sighed in unison as they got on the plane, sitting 
together in a seat next to the window. They looked back longingly as 
Kokomo disappeared behind them, wishing they could stay longer.

Aruba, Jamaica ooo I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego baby why don&#39;t we go

*****************************************

Relena walked into her room after a long day, sighing. She got to laid 
back while on her trip, she was being lazy with her paper work. 

&quot;Relena-sama...&quot;

The blonde looked up and gasped.

There lay Hilde, covered in chocolate with the word &#39;Thankyou&#39; on her 
in whip cream, on her bed. 

&quot;I ran out of thankyou stationary,&quot; the German girl purred.

Ooo I wanna take you down to Kokomo
