<h1>Valkyrie (part 1 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a>

<pre>Six o&#39; clock in the morning, and the council had already been debating for
a good three-quarters of an hour.  Relena winced, fighting a massive
headache despite the aspirin she had been dutifully taking for the last
twelve.  Right now, she knew, the headache was the least of her problems.

Wufei had done something.
  
The details weren&#39;t all /that/ important, Relena thought as she rubbed the
bridge of her nose, all that mattered was that Wufei&#39;s name was now linked
to an incredible amount of destruction, and the better part of a large
city state hated him by name.  

	//I don&#39;t even know much more than that.  They can&#39;t give the
military information to me, but they can give it to Noin, and she says
she&#39;ll take care of it?  But then, where is she now?  Good god, being the
ruler of the Sank Kingdom and 35 cents would buy me a bad cup of coffee...
and I could use it.//

	The official Relena had quietly christened &quot;Mr. Wiggle&quot; was
speaking again, using up an incredible amount of time to say very little. 
It was absurdly fascinating to watch the way his mustache dipped when he
talked, and she wondered if she was the first person to ever pass a
meeting this way, cutting through the nervousness and tension with stupid
humor.

	//Duo.	I&#39;d bet anything Duo does.//  

The man&#39;s low baritone rumbled across the large gathering room, and the
anger in his tone probably would have scared Relena much more if she
hadn&#39;t been so tired.  It was a struggle for her to even keep her eyes
open, let alone keep some professional look of interest on her face. Each
time the members of the assembly spoke among themselves and turned away
from her, she resisted the growing urge to simply climb up onto the long
meeting table and take a nap.

	//Come on, Relena.  Pull it together.  If these men get Wufei
today, they&#39;ll crucify him.//

	The Chinese pilot had sat next to her for the entire meeting, his
arms crossed and his eyes locked, staring straight ahead.  She doubted he
would have any reaction, even if the council brought out a pole axe and
demanded his head right then and there.

	//Stonefaced asshole.  I&#39;m not even going to get a &quot;thank you,
Relena&quot; out of this, I can almost taste it.//

	&quot;I hope the Sank Kingdom understands the danger of defending such
a gross infraction of its own Absolute Pacifism policy.&quot;  The man was
almost theatrically grave, staring at her with serious eyes.
	
&quot;The Sank Kingdom is quite aware of its position, Mr. W....I mean,
Colonel...&quot;  Relena took a deep breath, grateful that the man across the
table didn&#39;t react to her near fatal error.
  
	//I really don&#39;t know what rank he is at all, I can barely
remember which country I&#39;m in...//

	&quot;The Sank Kingdom will not allow mob rule to determine the fate of
even a single man.  In the heat of battle, it is possible and very well
conceivable for facts to be obscured, clouded...&quot;

	&quot;Are you saying that we /caused/ this horrible disaster, as some
kind of ploy to discredit the Sank Kingdom??!&quot; 

	A young, blonde haired gentleman, just a few years older than her
had jumped to his feet at her words, staring at her with a livid, wide
eyed rage.
	&quot;My sister, my brother, my parents... they&#39;re all dead because of
that man!!!&quot;  One finger tremblingly pointed at Wufei, whose expression
had not changed.

	&quot;You dare to tell me that our country would do this?  That I...&quot; 
The boy&#39;s hands turned into tightly clenched fists.  &quot;...that I would kill
my own family?!&quot;
	
Relena noticed too late the insignia on his jacket, the color of his vest.

	
//Those are military colors.  He&#39;s a part of the military... oh hell,
Relena, good job.//

	&quot;The Sank Kingdom will not give in to... we can not allow...&quot;

	Relena took a deep breath, trying to steady herself.  The room was
spinning slightly, she could hear the murmurs of some of the people in the
room, and swore she heard Wufei mutter something under his breath about
&quot;weak women.&quot;

	//The Sank Kingdom.  I have to do this for the Sank, for my
brother, and Noin, and everyone.  They&#39;re all counting on me.//

	Relena knew she was supposed to think of Heero Yuy in this moment
of crisis, the boy soldier that she had engaged in an intricate dance of
danger and intrigue since their meeting.  Instead, her mind&#39;s eye focused
strangely on another person, a girl, with long blonde hair and a wicked
smile, incredibly sharp eyes that openly disclosed that they were hiding
everything.  

	//Dorothy?//

	&quot;The Sank Kingdom will not allow any action taken against this
pilot until there has been a proper military tribunal.	Unless any
evidence can be presented here today, I see no reason to continue this
meeting.&quot;

	It was then that the boy started screaming at her.  He was
restrained by two of the military police, but they barely had a hold on
him, his rage had taken over, giving him incredible strength to launch
insults at her with explosive force.

	&quot;You /bitch/!!!!  You know the truth!  How can you lie for him?! 
How can you let him walk away?!  You filthy, lying /bitch/!  You took
/everything/ from me!  How could you?!	 HOW??!!&quot;

	Relena didn&#39;t respond, /couldn&#39;t/ respond, and turned away, wiping
a tear from the corner of her eye before anyone could notice.  She
repressed the sudden, violent urge to go for Wufei&#39;s throat as she heard
him chuckle, just slightly, proving his views on weak women once again to
be true.

------------------------------

	&quot;Relena!&quot;

	&quot;Miss Peacecraft!!&quot;

	Noin and Quatre were moving quickly to her as she walked down the
long hallway toward the building&#39;s exit.  Wufei trailed behind her, still
crossing his arms, completely unconcerned.

	&quot;How did it go?&quot;  Noin asked.  Somehow, her concern only irritated
Relena more.

	//Of course it went fine, it has to be fine.  Why even ask?  I&#39;m
the backbone of the Sank Kingdom, I&#39;m not /allowed/ to disappoint you.//
	
&quot;For not having any information, it went fine.&quot;  Relena fought to keep her
voice calm and steady, always with that hint of peaceful understanding. 
She knew it wouldn&#39;t do any good to snap at either one of them, no matter
how much the headache pounding at her temples was sharpening her temper to
a razor-sharp edge.  &quot;They&#39;re probably going to set up a tribunal, to try
Wufei for war crimes against their country.&quot;

	&quot;They don&#39;t have the proof.&quot;  Noin murmured, staring across the
hall, to where a group of military leaders were gathered.  &quot;They don&#39;t
have the evidence to back any of their claims.	I&#39;d be willing to bet they
don&#39;t even call a formal hearing.  This is over.&quot;

	&quot;... but he did it, didn&#39;t he Lieutenant Noin?&quot;  Relena said
quietly, without a hint of emotion in her voice.

	Noin shifted on her feet, and wouldn&#39;t meet the younger girl&#39;s
gaze.

	&quot;I thought so.&quot;

	&quot;Relena?&quot;   

	Noin&#39;s concern rubbed Relena the wrong way, but for whatever
reason, Quatre&#39;s intrusion was worse.  The almost cherubic Gundam pilot
was staring at her closely, concernedly, especially as she swayed slightly
on her feet, putting a hand to her temple.

	&quot;Relena?  Are you all right?&quot;

	&quot;Yes, yes... I&#39;m fine.	I just need some breakfast, and an
aspirin.&quot;

	//...and some morphine, and about three years on the beach, and an
Absolute Pacifism Uzi... just in case any problems should show up.//

	Relena truly believed in her cause.  There were just times when
not believing it would have been a lot more fun.

	//... like right about now.//

	She could almost feel the cold vibes emanating from the Gundam
pilot standing behind her, and didn&#39;t have to look to know that he was
scowling.

	&quot;Do you need something, Wufei?&quot;

	&quot;I just wanted a good look at the person who saved my life.&quot;

	&quot;Oh.&quot;

	&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to thank her?&quot; Quatre chirped, just a hint of
disdain in his voice

	Relena bit back a groan, wanted to shake the blonde Gundam pilot
until his head popped off.

	//For a Gundam pilot, you are the most /incredibly/ naive...//

	&quot;I never asked her for help.&quot;

	She knew that she would continue to get nothing from Wufei but
contempt, but still, the words stung.

	&quot;Go...&quot;

	Relena pointed towards the door, to the Gundam she knew was
waiting for its pilot.

	&quot;Just go away, Wufei.  I&#39;d suggest as far away from this place as
possible, until the trial.  And try not to blow up any cows on your way
out, please.&quot;

	The pilot walked away, and as Relena reached into her pocket for
the ever-present bottle of extra-strength aspirin, her closest companion
now, someone approached them.

	//Once again, they&#39;ll speak only to Noin...//  Relena thought
bitterly as the solider whispered into the lieutenant&#39;s ear.  

	//Maybe Noin would like to be the princess, although that might
mess up things with her and Zechs.//

	&quot;Your Highness.  We have a... situation.&quot;

	Relena downed four aspirin on her way out the door,  didn&#39;t have
time to think or even breathe after that until well past nightfall.
