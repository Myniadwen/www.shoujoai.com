<pre>Don&#39;t Walk Away
By - Zi Dosukoi

This is my first yuri fic. It&#39;s Dorothy/Relena. There&#39;s nothing 
graphic, but there is a small scene and some cussing. ^^ I hope you 
like it! Please e-mail me with comments, etc. And this fic is up at 
fanfiction.net under the penname Akira Kinryu as well, so you can 
review it there too! ^^ Bai!

==================================================================

***
Don&#39;t walk away
See I just can&#39;t find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so you&#39;ll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray?
***

&quot;That&#39;s it, Dorothy!&quot;

Watching Relena with curious and confused eyes, Dorothy blinked. &quot;What 
did I do now?&quot; she groaned. She grunted when Relena slapped her across 
the face, and she rubbed the red spot while snapping, &quot;What the hell 
was that for?!&quot;

Relena glared at her, tears forming in her eyes. &quot;Dorothy, stop being 
sarcastic. We aren&#39;t meant to be together, and I&#39;m not going to put 
myself in that position any longer.&quot;

A playful smirk appearing on her lips, Dorothy pounced on the 
brown-haired girl and kissed her as they fell to the floor, slipping 
her tongue into her mouth for a brief moment before pulling back. She 
grinned at Relena&#39;s flustered look. &quot;That position?&quot;

Slapping the blonde again, Relena pulled herself away from Dorothy and 
back to her feet. &quot;That&#39;s the kind of thing I hate! I want you to grow 
up and be serious, but you won&#39;t!&quot;

Dorothy stood, still holding a hand to her cheek, but a more 
dispassionate look covered her features. &quot;I am serious when I need to 
be, Ms. Relena,&quot; she replied mockingly. &quot;You always say that, but you 
never leave.&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m leaving now,&quot; Relena shot back, ending the discussion 
abruptly.

Feeling her breath catch in her chest, Dorothy stared when Relena 
picked up a suitcase. &quot;Relena.&quot; &#39;Don&#39;t go!&#39; she pleaded in her mind, 
but those words were not spoken.

***
And how can I stop losing you
How can I begin to say
When there&#39;s nothing left to do but walk away
***

Still staring at the closed door, Dorothy couldn&#39;t believe that Relena 
had actually left her. She slowly fell to her knees, her eyes locked on 
the place Relena had been standing two seconds ago.

Dorothy closed her eyes tightly, clenching her fists. &#39;No. She&#39;s not 
going. I&#39;m just dreaming. She&#39;ll be with me in the morning when I wake 
up, and I can see her smile again.&#39;

The blonde slapped herself hard. She stared at her hand, then repeated 
the action. &quot;Dammit, why won&#39;t I wake up?!&quot; the blonde subbed, tears 
running down her cheeks and making her eyes red. &quot;I want to see your 
smile... I want you to be happy. Come back...&quot;

***
I close my eyes
Just to try to see you smile one more time
But it&#39;s been so long now all I do is cry
Can&#39;t we find some love to take this away
&#39;Cause the pain gets stronger every day
***

&#39;No... I won&#39;t let her get away,&#39; she told herself as she rose. She 
stared shakily toward the door. &#39;Maybe she&#39;ll forgive me. God, I hope 
she&#39;ll forgive me... I love her.&#39;

&quot;I love her...&quot; she breathed, entering the hall. She looked down toward 
the elevator of the hotel they were in;  they were staying together in 
the L3 colony for business Relena had needed to tend to.

Blonde hair whipping behind her, Dorothy ran to the elvator at the end 
of the hall. She pounded on the down button frantically, looking up and 
waiting for the light to come on indicating that the box was on her 
floor. &quot;Come on, come on,&quot; she demanded, urgency in her tone.

&#39;I can catch her before she reaches the shuttle bay,&#39; she thought. &quot;If 
this damn thing would hurry up!&quot; she shouted angrily. She blinked as 
the doors slid open in front of her. &quot;...thank you...&quot;

Dorothy ran out just as Relena was about to climb into her limo. 
&quot;Relena!&quot; she called, dashing toward her, tears still rolling down her 
cheeks. &quot;Wait!&quot; She put her hands to her knees as she tried to catch 
her breath, but her rough inhaling stopped when Relena&#39;s cold voice 
asked, &quot;What do you need? If you have anything important to say, say 
it.&quot;

***
How can I begin again
How am I to understand
When there&#39;s nothing left to do but walk away
***

Her mind racing, Dorothy couldn&#39;t think of what to say. A million 
things came to mind, and she couldn&#39;t choose one idea that was clear 
enough.

I love you. Don&#39;t leave me. I need you. Don&#39;t go.

Before she could say anything, Relena snort. &quot;Another childish game... 
Good bye, Ms. Catalonia.&quot; With that, she got into her limo and told the 
driver to take her to the nearest L3 shuttle port, not even glancing 
back at Dorothy as she sped off.

&#39;I have to get to that shuttle port,&#39; she thought, starting to run 
again. The cool air hit hair face and arms as she ran, ignoring 
everyone she pushed down and giving the finger to a car that she ran in 
front of when its driver honked the horn angrily and cussed at her when 
as she passed.

She realized that she hadn&#39;t changed into formal clothes, still wearing 
a green tank top and light blue jeans with simple sneakers on her feet, 
but that didn&#39;t matter to her at all.

&#39;She can&#39;t leave me. I&#39;ll die without her. She doesn&#39;t know how much 
I&#39;ve come to depend on her. Why do I always screw things up? I won&#39;t 
let you go.&#39;

***
See now why
All my dreams been broken
I don&#39;t know where we&#39;re going
Everything we said and all we done now
Don&#39;t let go, I don&#39;t wanna walk away
See now why
All my dreams are broken
Don&#39;t know where we&#39;re going
Everything begins to set us free
Can&#39;t you see, I don&#39;t wanna walk away
***

As she approached the shuttle bay, she saw Relena&#39;s limo pull away from 
the enterance. Losing her breath, Dorothy hefted herself up the steps 
and into the main lobby of the port. She looked around, breathing hard, 
and forced herself to keep going when she saw Relena moving away from 
her toward a shuttle gate.

After minutes of searching, Dorothy finally found Relena walking down a 
quiet hallway, very few people walking around her. The blonde woman 
stumbled past a sign that said, &quot;RESTRICTED AREA,&quot; and, in a hoarse 
voice, called, &quot;Relena!&quot;

Relena stopped and turned on her heel. She looked at Dorothy with one 
eyebrow cocked. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; she asked cautiously, watching Dorothy 
stagger toward her. &quot;You didn&#39;t run here, did you?&quot; She nearly laughed 
when Dorothy nodded.

&quot;Relena, please don&#39;t leave me,&quot; Dorothy said through gasps. &quot;I need 
you. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll try to make things better. I love you. Please...&quot;

The brown-haired girl&#39;s eyes dimmed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Dorothy...&quot; she 
mumbled, trailing off. She turned quickly, refusing to look the girl in 
the eyes.

***
If you go, I won&#39;t forget you girl
Can&#39;t you see that you will always be
Even though I had to let you go
There&#39;s nothing left to do
Don&#39;t walk away
***

Dorothy&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly. She forced herself to take those two 
steps forward in a quick stride, and she caught Relena by her wrist. 
&quot;No, don&#39;t...&quot;

Barely catching Dorothy before she collapsed, Relena held her close. 
&quot;Dorothy, will you be okay? Do you need me to call you a cab or 
anything? Are you-&quot;

&quot;R-Relena,&quot; the blonde interrupted raggedly. &quot;I don&#39;t want you to go. 
Being around you is when I&#39;m happiest. I can&#39;t stand not waking up to 
see you sleeping next to me or smiling at me. And I wouldn&#39;t be able to 
go on after everything...&quot;

She began to shake violently as Relena put a hand to the back of her 
head, but she pulled back and kissed her gently. After a few moments of 
keeping Relena&#39;s lips locked with hers, Dorothy let out a rough sigh. 
She looked at Relena with tired eyes. &quot;I know you&#39;ll hate me sometimes, 
and I&#39;m sorry. Just don&#39;t...just don&#39;t walk away.&quot;
