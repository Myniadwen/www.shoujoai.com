* * * * *

This most certainly wasn&#146;t what I was expecting, this quiet. I 
anticipated chaos, a mixture of crying and screaming. I expected to be 
awoken one morning by the sound of a heart breaking, being smashed 
into the floorboards but continuing to beat, and each beat bringing 
forth hundreds of new tears. I expected all of this; I expected to see 
a woman die of sorrow for the first time in my life.

But this - this silence and professional atmosphere - was not what I 
had predicted at all.

Heero told Relena he was leaving last week. I stayed awake all night, 
waiting for the sobs to start. I was disappointed and taken aback when 
they never did. So I&#146;ve been waiting ever since.

&#147;Are you all right?&#148; I ask her, trying to sound sympathetic and to 
keep the exasperation out of my voice. Why won&#146;t you break? I want to 
ask her but I don&#146;t. 

Her mouth is pursed into a thin line, so detached and emotionless. I 
wonder if she knows how unattractive she looks like this or how 
beautiful she looks when she cries. Sometimes I think that if she 
would have cried in front of him he would have stayed, because he&#146;d 
finally see how pretty she can be.

&#147;I&#146;m fine, Dorothy.&#148; A pretty little fake smile. Just like a doll. 
Aren&#146;t dolls supposed to break, shatter into millions of pieces?

&#147;You&#146;re not acting like yourself, Miss Relena. I&#146;m worried about you. 
Ever since Heero announced that-&#148;

&#147;I said that I&#146;m fine, Dorothy,&#148; she says, continuing to flip through 
her papers, not even sparing me a glance. &#147;A little sad that Heero has 
to leave, especially since he&#146;s been here for such a short amount of 
time. But really, you&#146;re behaving as though I should be smashing my 
hands against the walls.&#148;

Now that would be truly stunning. Relena curled into a tiny ball, 
sobbing into her knees, her knuckles chafed and bloody from the abuse.

&#147;I&#146;m worried,&#148; I repeat. It sounds like a reasonable thing to say. 
I&#146;ve decided that maybe the subject needs to be pushed. Maybe she&#146;ll 
break then.

She sighs and sets the papers down, her eyes raising to stare at me 
evenly. For a moment, I&#146;m sure that she can see through me. But then 
she smiles sweetly - an expression I haven&#146;t seen grace her face for 
quite a while. I honestly hoped that I&#146;d never see it again.

&#147;I know you are,&#148; she whispers, standing and crossing over to me. &#147;I 
know you are. But I&#146;m fine. I really am.&#148;

She cuddles into my arms and I reluctantly hold her close to me.

&#147;Besides, I have you.&#148;

Heero&#146;s words come tumbling back to me. She&#146;ll be all right. And she 
is. She hasn&#146;t broken, and I&#146;m beginning to think that she never will. 
After all, she has you.

She has me. So I suppose that means that I have her as well.

She has you.

I wonder if maybe Heero can see something that I can&#146;t see.
