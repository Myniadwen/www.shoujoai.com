<a href="../gundam/valkyrie-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>	&quot;Did you hear?&quot;

	The soldier skipped the staircase completely, vaulting over the
railing and onto the floor below without a second thought.  He darted past
small windows that opened up to a view of deep space, quickly running
toward the senior officer.

	&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

	&quot;It just came on the wire back from Earth.  Someone actually
kidnapped Relena Peacecraft!&quot;

	Five or six more heads turned, and other people looked around
corners, all staring at the young computer technician.

	&quot;No way!&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s gotta be a hoax.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m not kidding.  I get the live news faster &#39;cause of my special
hookup.  It&#39;s on all the channels - she&#39;s gone!&quot;

	There were a few murmurs from some of the soldiers.  Things
weren&#39;t perfect in space or on Earth, but the situation had improved
significantly since the Sank kingdom had become a prominent world power. 
Most of that, everyone knew, was due to Relena Peacecraft.

	&quot;Hey...&quot; One of the soldiers spoke up.	&quot;Didn&#39;t that Gundam pilot
use to be part of the Sank kingdom&#39;s guard?&quot;

	&quot;Who?&quot;

	The soldier rolled his eyes, smacking his tech friend lightly with
a clipboard.

&quot;For having such prime info, you sure don&#39;t pay attention to the world
around you much.  The kid... you know, the grumpy one with the giant mecha
suit?&quot;

The tech blinked, puzzled for a moment.

&quot;Sorry, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen him.&quot;
	
No one heard the quick footsteps backtracking down an empty hallway, as
Heero Yuy quickly made his way to the first available computer and started
typing, panic bringing extra speed to his search.
	
//No.  How did this happen?  How could they let this happen?  She&#39;s so
well guarded, and Quatre was there...//

	Heero frowned even as he thought the words.  Only his own
selfishness would have allowed him to view the blonde Gundam pilot as
enough security for Relena.  

	//I wanted to leave, so I used anything I could think of to
justify my decision.//

	It didn&#39;t take much searching to discover that the computer
technician had been right.  Every major news service in the galaxy had a
picture of Relena gracing their cover story.  Each article contained the
same limited information, nothing more than that she had vanished without
a trace, and the Sank kingdom wasn&#39;t talking.

	//Who would...?//

	Heero tried not to think about that.  The number of people willing
to abduct such an important figure for their own monetary or political
gains was absolutely overwhelming.  The number of those people who also
wouldn&#39;t have hesitated to hurt Relena if necessary made his blood freeze
to his bones.

	//Relena... what have I done to you?//

	&quot;Sir?&quot;

	Heero ignored the soldier who called to him, acting on automatic
as he climbed the ladder into his Gundam, slid into the seat. He didn&#39;t
think about it, knowing he could pilot his Gundam while sleepwalking if he
had to.  

The pilot was already focused on finding the fastest route back to Earth,
on stoking the anger that was building inside of him, ready to annihilate
whomever had dared to hurt her.  
	
&quot;Sir?!	Where are you going?&quot;
	
Heero looked down to the ground, to the same soldier staring up at him in
confusion.
	
&quot;If we don&#39;t locate Relena, you&#39;re going to need an army of Gundams to
keep anything safe out here.  I&#39;ve got to find her before it&#39;s too late.&quot;

	Any argument the soldier made was drowned out as the Gundam&#39;s
engines powered up. Heero quickly shot out of the station, heading for
Earth.

-----------------------

	Relena woke several times before she felt alert enough to try and
get up.  The brunette knew that she was safe, and that she hadn&#39;t felt so
secure in a very long time.  Once or twice, Relena could sense someone
nearby, watching over her, and she knew, somehow, that she had nothing to
fear. 

The bed underneath her was deliciously soft and comfortable.  Relena
stretched out, relaxed and warm under the blankets that covered her, the
tips of the fingers of one hand peeping out, testing the temperature.  

It was a slightly cold morning, and that fact, mixed with the soothing
sound of the rain on the roof, made for a peaceful atmosphere she did not
want to abandon.

Relena kept dozing for what seemed like ages, falling asleep and then
waking slightly, only to fall asleep once more after a few minutes of
drowsy half-awareness.	Her thoughts were blurry and weak, they could not
pierce the cloud of fog around them.  Eventually, after quite a long time,
bits of memory started to return to her, and they were very disturbing,
almost forcefully pushing her awake.

//I remember... a picnic?  The Car.  Where... where am I?  What
happened?//

Relena blinked, hauling her mind out of sleep despite its protests, and
slowly sat up.	She wasn&#39;t in her own bed, and as she looked out the
window, toward a horizon filled with unfamiliar mountains, she realized
she wasn&#39;t in the Sank kingdom at all.

//What the - how in the world?!//

&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re awake, Relena.  I thought you might decide to sleep the
day away.&quot;

Relena turned, staring wide eyed at Dorothy, who smiled at her from the
doorway.

&quot;Dorothy... what happened?&quot;

&quot;I kidnapped you, Relena.&quot;

The brunette paused, blinked, and realized that no matter how many times
she let her mind run over that thought, it didn&#39;t make any more sense than
the first time she heard it.  

&quot;Is something wrong, Miss Relena?&quot;	

&quot;You... you kidnapped me?&quot;

&quot;Yes.  It&#39;s all over the news by now.&quot;	The blonde girl lightly tossed a
paper to her, Relena caught it, flipped it over.  A large picture of her
graced the cover, the headline &#39;Missing!&#39; was more than enough to convince
her that Dorothy wasn&#39;t kidding.

Relena scanned the first few paragraphs, and realized that the press was
completely without good leads or answers to their questions.  Dorothy had
gotten away with it, it seemed, and very few if any people knew what she
had done.

//Zechs and Noin, they must be frantic.//

&quot;Why?!	Dorothy, what&#39;s going on?&quot;

The blonde girl smiled, bending down to look Relena in the eyes.  The
brunette felt her skin tingle, realizing how close Dorothy was, noticing
too much, the way her chest rose and fell with each breath, the curve of
those slightly glimmering lips, her long, elegant eyelashes.

//Okay Relena, she&#39;s gorgeous, but can we stay focused here, please?//

&quot;You need a break, Relena.  The job you hold is endless, and if you don&#39;t
treat yourself better, it&#39;ll kill you.	You&#39;re skin and bones, your eyes
don&#39;t glimmer and shine anymore, not the way they used to.  I&#39;ve watched
too many optimistic, idealistic people get swallowed up by the things they
believe in. I won&#39;t let it happen to you.  You&#39;re too important to me.&quot;  

&quot;Dorothy?&quot;  

The blonde didn&#39;t waste any more time with words, leaned in, and kissed
her.  It was a much more interesting, detailed kiss than their first one,
mainly because the blonde had taken the lead.

Before she knew what was happening, long before she could think to
respond, Relena felt Dorothy&#39;s tongue between her lips, just for a moment,
sliding across her own, in the same sly manner that the blonde did
everything else.

&quot;Yikes!&quot; Relena said, giggling slightly, just a little breathless, as
Dorothy stood back up, staring at her with a smile.  The brunette suddenly
felt the need to put some more clothes on.  A lot more clothes.

&quot;T-that was my first french kiss... you know that?&quot;

&quot;Oh really, Relena?&quot;  Dorothy turned around, chuckling slightly.  &quot;I can&#39;t
wait to see how you improve.&quot;

Dorothy walked out of the bedroom, and after a few moments, Relena
scrambled after her.

----------------------------

&quot;This isn&#39;t going to work.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, Relena?&quot;

Relena looked back and forth across the narrow street as they walked,
expecting a cavalcade of police to appear at any moment.

&quot;I&#39;m the most famous face in the world right now, if not more than that. 
There&#39;s no way we can walk around like this.&quot;  She looked up at the
formless black cap perched on her head. &quot;Even if I am wearing a hat.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re not hoping someone sees us, and you can go back to the Sank
kingdom as soon as possible?&quot;

Relena blinked, realizing that until Dorothy had said it, she hadn&#39;t even
really thought about it.

&quot;You would do that, Dorothy?  You&#39;d just let me go?&quot;

&quot;Of course, Relena.  I thought, that maybe if I got you away from your old
life, it would give you a better perspective on what you really wanted. 
But if you really want to go back, I will happily accompany you.&quot;

Relena shook her head, and impulsively reached down, wrapping one of
Dorothy&#39;s hands in both of her own.

&quot;You&#39;re crazy, you know that?&quot;

-----------------------

Of all the places in the world to be, they ended up at the supermarket,
picking out food for the next week&#39;s worth of eating.  Relena&#39;s thoughts
kept drifting back to Zechs and Noin, to everyone who would be worried
about her.

//A week.  It&#39;s only a week, and if they find out where I am, I know they
won&#39;t let me stay.  Besides, I like it here... with Dorothy.//

&quot;A week without you should be enough to teach them not to take you for
granted,&quot; Dorothy murmured, picking up head of lettuce.  &quot;I don&#39;t
remember, Relena, do you like salads?&quot;

She turned, to see her brunette friend calmly juggling three oranges,
staring at her with a devilish grin.

&quot;Didn&#39;t think I could do that, didja?&quot;	Relena gently tossed two of them
back into the pile with the other fruit, and rolled the third down her
elbow, arcing it into Dorothy&#39;s hand cart.

&quot;Stupid human trick.  It&#39;s genetic.  Zechs can balance anything on his
nose.  Spoons vertically, and pencils on the eraser end if he tips his
head back.&quot;  She paused, putting her hand up to her face as if she was
thinking very hard.

&quot;I wonder if that&#39;s why Miss Noin likes him so much.&quot;

Dorothy had to swallow her laughter completely, or risk exploding, staring
after Relena as the girl calmly walked past her down the aisle, poker
faced but definitely smiling on the inside.

//Ah...Relena.	I knew the person I loved was still in there. I knew you
just needed the chance to be free.//

---------------------
  
&quot;Zechs...&quot; 

Noin&#39;s hands clenched in frustration as the blonde man shrugged off her
touch, kept walking back and forth in front of his desk, the frown
permanently carved into his face.  

She knew why he was upset.  Every man he could afford to spare was out
scouring the countryside, checking all the records for spacebound ships in
the last 24 hours, searching desperately for their missing leader.  The
Gundam pilots had all gone out searching as well.  Even Wufei had called
to get the latest information, and informed them he was searching too,
without ever explaining why.  

	Nothing had helped.  There had been no sign of Dorothy or Relena,
no ransom demand, no triumphant call from a dictator or other prominent
figurehead. Nothing.  It was as if the two girls had simply vanished.

&quot;Zechs... stop pacing.	It&#39;s going to be all right.  We&#39;ll find Relena. 
I&#39;m sure of it.&quot;

&quot;I knew her, Noin!  I knew what Dorothy was capable of, and I did nothing.
 I wasn&#39;t /thinking/ at all, just running out like that, believing it
would be all right.  I knew exactly what she might try to do.  I knew...&quot; 


Zechs kicked the metal wastebasket at his feet, sending it crashing hard
against the opposite wall. 

&quot;Damn it!&quot;

Noin stepped toward him, but turned at a knock on the door.  She opened
it, speaking for a few minutes with the soldier outside.  Zechs was
preoccupied with his own thoughts, but eventually noticed the hushed,
urgent conversation taking place at the doorway.

&quot;Noin?	What&#39;s going on?&quot;

Noin turned to him with a scowl on her face.

&quot;It looks like Relena&#39;s disappearance is only the tip of the iceberg.&quot;

------------------------

&quot;Holy shit!  It&#39;s you!&quot;

Dorothy whirled around as they reached the corner, to see a police officer
pointing at Relena, eyes wide, jaw gaping.

//Oh no.  Not yet.//

Usually, the blonde could count on the fact that most people in the world
were oblivious to almost everything that went on around them.  Dorothy had
been determined to give Relena as normal of a vacation as she could, and
other than the hat, there was no disguise she had asked the brunette to
wear.

&quot;Huh?  What?&quot;

Dorothy froze, unsure of what to do, trying to come up with a clever way
to run for it.	She was surprised when Relena laughed, giggling and
smiling as she turned to the blonde for a moment.

&quot;He really thinks I&#39;m...&quot; Relena turned to her, eyes calculating, and gave
Dorothy a wink, speaking loud enough to be heard by everyone.  &quot;He thinks
I&#39;m /her/.&quot;

Relena turned back to the policeman, setting down the bag of groceries she
was carrying, and pulled off her hat.  The man gasped.

&quot;You /are/ Relena Peacecraft!&quot;

A few more people had stopped, Dorothy looked around to realize they were
gathering quite a crowd.

//Relena, /what/ are you doing?!//

&quot;No I&#39;m not.&quot; Relena giggled, &quot;I&#39;m a lookalike.  But thank you very much
for the compliment!&quot;

&quot;A lookalike?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot;	Relena pointed toward the blonde.  &quot;Me and her.  We dress up like
Peacecraft and one of her friends and do parties and stuff.&quot;  She looked
down, craning her head as if admiring herself.	&quot;You really think I look
like her /that/ much?!&quot;

The cop frowned, staring more closely at her.

&quot;My gosh.  I&#39;m sorry, ma&#39;am, but that&#39;s uncanny.&quot;

&quot;Hey.&quot; A muscular college-age kid in a sleeveless t-shirt called out from
behind the cop.  &quot;You do parties? Either of you jump out of a cake?!&quot;

&quot;Maybe!&quot;  Relena called back.  &quot;Naked costs extra!&quot;

The kid laughed, and Relena picked up her groceries, continued walking. 
Dorothy looked back one more time, to see the cop scratching his head,
still staring at them.	

They didn&#39;t speak until they got home, and as soon as the door was shut
the two girls immediately burst into giggles.

&quot;Relena! That was brilliant!&quot;

The girl raised an eyebrow.

&quot;Who&#39;s Relena?!&quot;  Relena held a hand up to her chest, batting her eyes
like a movie star.  &quot;I just play her every now and again!&quot; 

The brunette rolled her eyes, chuckling.  

&quot;Maybe I should just be an actress, and forget about politics, huh?&quot;

Dorothy kept laughing as she started unloading the groceries, turned to
see Relena staring at a ripe, red tomato like she hadn&#39;t seen one before.

&quot;Do you know how long it&#39;s been since I was actually hungry?  Since I
really looked forward to even eating a meal?&quot;  

The brunette smiled at her, and Dorothy could barely contain her own
delight.

//Take it easy.  She doesn&#39;t want to see you so happy.	Relena wants the
Dorothy she remembers... the sly, dangerous person who keeps herself at an
arm&#39;s length... at least for now.//

The blonde tried to remember that, all through dinner, as she watched
Relena eat, those beautiful lips tantalizingly close and yet as far away
as the nearest star.  

Dorothy was perpetually at the edge of forgetting her plans, as she
watched the brunette gracefully eat her meal, perfectly polite and
delicate through years of training and practice. She loved to watch the
way Relena&#39;s eyebrows came together in sudden thought, the way her mouth
would catch on occasion, lip sticking out in the barest hint of a pout.
The blonde forgot herself, forgot everything as she watched Relena do
/anything/.

//You&#39;re mooning like it&#39;s puppy love, Dorothy.  Don&#39;t you think this is
just a little embarrassing?//

The blonde ignored that thought, and smiled, as Relena blushed in
embarrassment, finally noticing how closely the blonde girl was watching
her.

//Take it slow, just take it slowly, or you&#39;ll frighten her away.  You&#39;ve
got all the time in the world, now.//

There was a certain enjoyment in that, and the chase could be nearly as
breathtaking, as exciting as the catch, if the blonde played her cards
right.

//It all seems like a dream, though, with you here, Relena.//

Later on, Dorothy watched her sleep, mirroring Relena&#39;s smile as something
in her dreams caught her fancy.

//Will you be here in the morning?  Will we continue this game, and will
it be more than a game?  Or will the Sank... and Heero Yuy drag you back
no matter what I try to do?//

Dorothy crossed her arms.  There was always the second step of her plan,
and that could be pushed up a little, if Relena seemed ready to stray, if
the blonde was forced to make a move.  

//It&#39;s not ready yet, though.  We&#39;re so close.	Just a few more days, just
give me a few more days.//

------------------------

//I should have never left her with Quatre.//

Heero stepped into the room, and did a double take, as he gazed into the
eyes of each person who looked up at him.

//All right... check that.  I never should have left him with Noin, Zechs,
Quatre, Trowa, Duo, and Wufei.//

&quot;You still haven&#39;t found her yet.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;  Zechs replied calmly, as if he had been expecting the Gundam pilot
to show up all along.  The blonde man was going over reports with Noin,
items that seemed to have nothing to do with Relena&#39;s disappearance.

&quot;I only got hold of the preliminary report.  Do we know who might have
her?&quot;

&quot;Dorothy.&quot;

Duo answered the brown-haired boy&#39;s question, and was surprised to see
Heero, the usually expressionless pilot, actually go pale, and take a half
step back in shock.  It was the closest thing he&#39;d seen to an actual
emotion from the Japanese pilot.

&quot;Are you sure?	She could have easily traded her off-planet, or given her
to any number of-&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve got our men on all the exits off-planet.&quot;  Zechs murmured. 
&quot;There&#39;s no indication that anyone has her.  We&#39;ve already gotten several
claims by various smaller terrorist organizations, but none of them seem
to be involved with Catalonia in any way.&quot;

&quot;Heero.  Hey, Heero.&quot;  Duo watched the other pilot, staring out the
window, almost as if in a dream.

&quot;Heero, do you know something?&quot; Quatre asked.

The brown-haired pilot paused before responding, still staring out the
window.

&quot;I don&#39;t think Dorothy&#39;s given her up.	This is something more specific,
something personal.&quot;

Heero&#39;s own thoughts were even more grim, and also very personal.  He
often wished he had less than a picture-perfect memory, this moment more
so than any other.

He remembered precisely the way Dorothy had told him to go after Relena,
the look in her eyes, the pain he had seen there.

//You... you and Relena?//

Heero had been given a chance, and had chosen the emptiness of space over
the ruler of the Sank kingdom, and over every pleasure and pain that title
entailed.
  
The tiniest voice, deep inside his heart, told him she had been waiting
all along to take his place.
