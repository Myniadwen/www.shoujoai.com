<h1>Fighting Partnership</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cutter.html">Cutter</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Notes: This fic was written under the influence of a recent viewing of a 
Kurosawa movie, a sunburn, and extreme fatigue. (Be warned!) It takes 
place in no particular time, really. . . .

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sally walked into the room she was sharing with Noin while Howard did 
some maintenance on their craft. As she opened the door, she heard *it* 
again. That little sigh, accompanied by a murmured &quot;Zechs. . . .&quot; //It 
wouldn&#39;t bother me so much if she weren&#39;t muttering that *constantly*. . 
.and if it weren&#39;t so clear that Zechs is abysmally dim-witted in the 
love department and is *never* going to come settle down with her.// 
Sally mused, //Guy&#39;s half off his rocker anyway. . .can&#39;t see what Noin 
sees in him. . . .// 

&quot;Zechs. . .I&#39;ll wait. . . .&quot; Noin, looking out the window in a rapture 
of martyrdom and unrequited love, didn&#39;t seem to notice that Sally had 
entered. 

//&quot;I&#39;ll WAIT?!&quot;// Sally slammed the door shut. //That&#39;s IT! I can&#39;t sit 
by and watch anymore. This ends NOW!// 

&quot;Noin.&quot; she said, in her command-mode voice. She never used the name 
&#39;Lucrezia,&#39; believing along with its owner that it was one of the most 
horrid appellations a woman had ever been cursed with. 

&quot;Oh!&quot; The purple-haired pilot stood up quickly. &quot;Hi, Sally, I didn&#39;t 
hear you come in. How are you?&quot; 

&quot;Frustrated,&quot; Sally replied, one eyebrow rising ironically. 

&quot;Frustrated? Why?&quot; 

&quot;Well, let&#39;s make a list, shall we? First, Howard&#39;s guys haven&#39;t 
finished fixing our equipment yet, and it&#39;s been three DAYS. Second, I 
had to listen to Wufei rant at me for two HOURS yesterday. And he can&#39;t 
even remember to call me &#39;Sally&#39;! &#39;Onna&#39; this, &#39;Onna&#39; that. . . . Third, 
and most annoyingly, I have had to listen to you muttering about Zechs, 
a man who can&#39;t commit to you, can&#39;t see you love him, and furthermore 
can&#39;t even decide on his own goddamned NAME, every other minute for the 
past I don&#39;t even know how long. What&#39;s it going to take for you to 
realize he can&#39;t give you what you want? And finally, I am not getting 
any, and with the way you&#39;re moping, it looks like I won&#39;t BE getting 
any until sometime in the next millennium!&quot; 

Having finished, Sally felt much better, and gave a satisfied sigh, at 
peace with the world once more. 

Noin, on the other hand, did not seem to know what to do with this 
information. &quot;I. . .you. . .but. . . .&quot; Suddenly, it seemed to occur to 
her to be angry, and so she was. &quot;You. . .you have no right to say those 
things about Zechs and I! We&#39;re different. . .it&#39;s hard. . .Zechs is. . 
. .&quot; She continued to splutter for awhile, but realized it wasn&#39;t really 
helping her argument, and settled for throwing a punch at Sally. 

//NOW we&#39;re getting somewhere,// Sally thought joyfully, as she caught 
the punch and began to wrestle with the other woman. //I do so love 
strong women.// They rolled and tussled on the floor for a long time, 
evenly matched, until Noin started to fight dirty (hair-pulling) and 
managed to distract Sally long enough to pin her to the ground in a 
strong hold. Sweat covered her face, neck, and arms from the exertion, 
and her tank top stuck to her like it was molded for her body, a fact 
which Sally was not unappreciative of. Noin did, after all, have a 
rather nice chest. 

Both women were breathing heavily, and it was awhile before Noin caught 
her breath and the scattered pieces of her train of thought enough to 
pant, &quot;Sally. . .don&#39;t. . .ever talk. . .about my business. . .like 
that. And what. . .does YOUR not getting any. . .have to do with ME?&quot; 
Every few words were punctuated by deep, sucking breaths. Noin&#39;s hair 
had fallen into her eyes, and she desperately wanted to brush it away, 
but was too wary to give up her hold on Sally. She wanted answers. 

Completely unexpectedly, Sally smiled. Then she quite deliberately 
lifted her head and bit, hard, on the flesh of Noin&#39;s inner elbow. Noin 
screeched, startled, and it was enough for Sally to break the hold and 
flip her over onto her back, pinned to the floor. &quot;I want you,&quot; she 
said. 

Noin found herself trapped by Sally&#39;s eyes, glittering dangerously and 
with something she didn&#39;t want to identify. . .but recognized, to her 
dismay, as lust. //Lust. . .for *me*?// &quot;You can&#39;t mean that. . . . You 
want me. . .?&quot; She discovered that she was out of breath, even though 
her respiration should&#39;ve returned to normal by then. Sally&#39;s body was 
in contact with hers, all along the line from chest to feet. Her arms 
were trapped to the sides of her head, and she felt Sally&#39;s weight on 
top of her chest and torso and Sally&#39;s knee insinuated firmly between 
her legs. //I don&#39;t understand. . . .// 

&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Sally, deliberately. &quot;I want you. And I&#39;m sick of 
waiting.&quot; Totally in control, and with perfectly even breathing, she 
brought her head down the bare inches that separated their faces and 
kissed Noin savagely on the mouth, almost ripping at her lips. Noin 
struggled, trying to squirm away, but couldn&#39;t. So she used the only 
weapon available to her. She bit Sally&#39;s lip. 

Hard. 

&quot;Why you little. . .&quot; Sally&#39;s eyes flashed with something undefinable, 
and Noin felt a hot rush of petty satisfaction as the other woman turned 
her head to the side and spat a drop of blood on the ground. &quot;You know,&quot; 
she said, almost conversationally, &quot;I&#39;ve always been very fond women as 
fearless as you, Noin.&quot; 

//Fond of women. . .she always did seem like the dykish type, actually. 
. . .// Suddenly, it occurred to her with alarming presence that this 
was actually happening. //This is real. . .this is *real*. . .it&#39;s not a 
joke. . .Sally&#39;s really doing this. To me.// Fear, and something utterly 
foreign coursed through her at the realization. No, if she was honest, 
it wasn&#39;t totally foreign to her. . .she&#39;d just never experienced it 
quite this strongly. . .and never with anyone but Zechs. //Oh god. . . 
.// 

Sally bent down and kissed her again, and she began to feel 
light-headed. //I want her to stop. . .but her weight on top of me. . 
.so comforting. . .and her lips. . . . Wait! I&#39;m don&#39;t like women that 
way! Do I? I mean, I&#39;ve always identified more with men. . .women can 
sometimes be so weak. . .but then, sometimes they&#39;re the best company, 
aren&#39;t they? Men can be such idiots. . .Sally&#39;s not weak at all. . . .// 

Seeming to pick up on the wandering of her attention, Sally very 
deliberately ground the knee between her legs upward into her crotch, 
and Noin was brought shatteringly back into the present situation with a 
moan. //I. . .did I just feel that? Nothing could feel like that! I. . 
.ohhhh. . .I like this. . .I *like* this?!// 

Sally began licking at her lower lip purposefully, and Noin forgot for a 
moment that she was supposed to be trying to escape. Her mouth seemed to 
open against her own will, and Sally&#39;s tongue was instantly there, in so 
deep she thought she would gag on it. . . . Then it started to move, 
swiping, probing at every recess of her mouth and--hot hot hot hot 
hot--it plunged, demanding, impossibly in and in as if Sally was trying 
to drive her head into the floor in her urgency and Noin felt she was 
being filled, invaded, and Sally&#39;s tongue was licking her teeth, the 
roof of her mouth, the inside of her cheeks and it was good, so good. . 
. . She was kissing back. . . . Was she supposed to enjoy it this much? 
//My god, what am I doing? What about Zechs? And this. . .she&#39;s forcing 
me. . .no matter what I feel, this way, it&#39;s just. . .wrong. . . .// 

Sally chose that moment to pull back for air, and Noin felt empty. She 
needed, craved, that feeling of being filled again. . .but Sally was 
looking down at her, with an almost questioning expression on her face. 
Her eyes challenged, and Noin read them clearly. //Well?// 

She answered back in her thoughts. //You stopped. . .stopped when you 
held all the cards, had all the power. You&#39;re not trying to hurt me, are 
you? You just wanted to get my attention. If I asked to right now, you&#39;d 
get up off me, and agree to go on as if this had never happened.// Noin 
was vaguely surprised to learn that she&#39;d become so adept at reading her 
friend&#39;s expressions without realizing it. . .but then, Sally had been 
her bulwark, ever since they&#39;d met, and the best friend Noin had ever 
had, except Zechs. //Zechs. . . .// 

The challenge in Sally&#39;s eyes was still there, waiting to be answered. 
Only a little bit afraid of the future it would bring her, Noin made her 
decision. //Zechs isn&#39;t here.// She strained her neck, reaching up from 
the floor, and claimed Sally&#39;s mouth. 

Sally looked down at her for a brief instant before curving her lips in 
a feral grin and pinning Noin to the floor with the force of her kisses 
once again. Noin was content to surrender unconditionally beneath her, 
opening her mouth as wide as it would go to admit Sally, and when 
Sally&#39;s knee forced itself even harder against her crotch and her legs 
were forced wider, wider, she groaned helplessly and wrapped her shaking 
thighs around Sally&#39;s leg, squeezing tightly. As she rubbed up against 
her (friend? lover? partner?), searching for friction, the only thought 
floating through her mind that would stay long enough to be understood 
was, //I guess I *do* like women that way. . . .// 

The kissing seemed to go on forever, both women breathless, and Noin had 
no idea she could feel this hot under someone&#39;s talented mouth; every 
inch of her skin was burning and she had itches she couldn&#39;t describe in 
places she didn&#39;t know she&#39;d had. After an indeterminate period of time, 
Sally seemed to decide it was safe to let go of the hands she held 
captive, and proceeded to trail one of her now-free hands down the side 
of Noin&#39;s neck, using the other to stroke against her clothed abdomen. 
Noin&#39;s toned muscles jumped as she gasped wildly and tried to remember 
how to breathe. Everything was wet, sweat-slicked; her tongue slid over 
and under Sally&#39;s and Sally&#39;s hands were somehow at her waist, pushing 
her shirt slowly up, up. . . . 

//I can&#39;t believe she&#39;s letting me do this. . .I mean, I knew the 
chemistry was there. . .that she could. . .but I never really believed 
she *would*. . .and she seems to be enjoying herself. . . .// Sally 
laughed into Noin&#39;s throat and continued to push her tank top up along 
her body, revealing tanned but still-white skin inch by inch until it 
bunched up just below her breasts. Both women had the same habit of 
forgoing bras in the summer unless in a battle situation, and she could 
see the curved outlines of Noin&#39;s loose breasts clearly through the thin 
shirt. 

Noin continued to thrash weakly beneath Sally&#39;s body until she felt two 
knees spreading her apart, her shirt being suddenly yanked up to her 
shoulders, and hands running over her newly-exposed breasts. //Wha. . .? 
I feel. . .something. . .// An inarticulate cry tore out of her throat 
as fingers began to stroke her, thumbs running over her nipples, so hard 
they were almost painful, and a skilled, hot tongue began to travel down 
her neck. &quot;Oh. . .ohhhhh. . . .&quot; It felt like everything and nothing, 
Sally&#39;s fingers tracing around her nipples, stroking, then--ohhh-- 
squeezing her left breast in one hand. All her nerves were in her 
breast, and all the world was in Sally&#39;s calloused, perfect hand, and 
dimly she was aware of the feeling she&#39;d had before, one of discomfort 
in her panties. Sally squeezed the other breast in rhythm and rolled her 
left nipple between thumb and forefinger, licking the hollow of her 
collarbone. Good, so good. . . . All Noin could do was mindlessly spread 
her legs wider for her lover--yes, there was no doubt now--impossibly 
wide. . .//please//. . .and suddenly she realized what it was, the 
feeling, and shuddered as she felt her panties soaking wet and soiled, 
rubbing against her. 

&quot;Sally. . .Sally, I. . .oh god. . . .&quot; She rolled her head back and 
forth as Sally&#39;s mouth, oh, her mouth, made its way down the center of 
her chest, painting a wet line as it delved deep into the hollow between 
her breasts. Sally took a moment, spellbound, to bury her nose in that 
forbidden place. . .musky, damp, like a garden or a jungle. . .she had 
always loved breasts. She nuzzled Noin&#39;s a little, rubbing her nose 
against her catlike as she sniffed her scent. 

Noin moaned at that and lay, still and motionless, with tears of 
pleasure in her eyes as the sensation of teeth scraping over her 
breasts, biting down on sensitive nerves, threatened to blind her. Then 
Sally&#39;s tongue darted out again, and teased at a nipple. 

Noin screamed. 

Pleased, Sally leaned down and captured the erect nipple in her mouth, 
sucking. Noin knew that was what babies did, what breasts were for, but 
she had never been suckled, and could not even begin to describe the 
feeling. Her breath came in hoarse, shallow gasps and she was aware in 
the foggy recesses of her brain that she was going to explode. Briefly, 
she considered the idea of Zechs doing this to her, his mouth on her in 
this intimate way, and discovered that she could not imagine it. 
Nothing, no one could make her feel as good as Sally. . .sucking 
hungrily, fiercely. . . . She was in shock and still on the hard floor 
of their room as waves of pleasure washed over her. . .Sally&#39;s mouth 
left her right nipple and she cried out in loss until it latched firmly 
down on her left. . . . 

. . .//this isn&#39;t right,// thought Sally. . . 

. . .and clamped down brutally with her teeth.

&quot;What the FUCK do you think you&#39;re *doing*?!&quot; Noin screeched, liquified 
muscles coming alive as she kneed Sally in the stomach and heaved her 
across the room, then sat up and cradled her breast protectively against 
the pain. 

Sally laughed. &quot;Got you back,&quot; she said cryptically. &quot;You and I are an 
equal partnership, Noin, and you weren&#39;t made to be a passive lover. 
What&#39;s making you one now? I&#39;m not making love to someone who&#39;s not 
burning as hot as I&#39;m burning, and I don&#39;t do all the work, either. I 
want to fuck Noin, Lucrezia Noin, and not some paper doll without 
initiative. You&#39;re a fighter, a tiger, and I&#39;m not Zechs Marquise, or 
Peacecraft, or whoever the hell he is, and you do not have to play the 
sweet, accepting woman that takes whatever scraps I toss out. I don&#39;t do 
things, or people, that way.&quot; She folded her arms over her chest and 
looked at Noin, challenging once again. 

//Why does she think that. . .// Noin wondered, still a little dazed 
from pleasure and fury. And then she saw. //I *have* been doing that. . 
.with Zechs, ever since I met him, it was always be quiet and sweet and 
understanding and take whatever he could give me. . .I took it all and I 
was glad. . .but it wasn&#39;t enough. . .I fucking gave up first at the 
academy for him! And now. . .Sally. . . . I was doing it again and I 
didn&#39;t even know I was doing it; letting her rule me and just taking it. 
It&#39;s such a habit. . .but it&#39;s not my true nature, is it?// Noin rocked 
back a little on her heels, stunned. &quot;Sally. . . .&quot; //But what is in my 
nature?// she wondered. She asked herself the question and received no 
answer. //What do I want to do, right now? I. . .I am a fighter. I want 
to. . .be with her. . .I want to feel fire. . .I want a mouth on my 
breast again. . .I want to struggle. . .I want hands everywhere on my 
body. . .I want to make her feel what I&#39;m feeling. . .I want. . . .// 

Casting about, she finally struck on something that seemed true to her, 
natural. She tore off the tank top that had been hopelessly tangled 
about her shoulders and threw it into a corner. And then she pounced. 
She flew across the room with a wordless battle cry and knocked Sally 
back on the ground, surging up to take her lips and thoroughly frenching 
her. For the first time in her adult life, she actually took control of 
a sexual encounter, and kissed Sally breathless. //She. . .she&#39;s so good 
to me. . .I want to make her feel good. . .my best friend. . . .// &quot;I&#39;m 
back, but can you handle me?&quot; Noin teased, pausing briefly in her 
assault on Sally&#39;s lips, as she stripped her of her button-down shirt 
with fingers steady for the first time in ages. 

&quot;I think so,&quot; Sally said, and smirked. 

The two women from then on groped and stroked and licked and tickled 
with equal fervor, rolling recklessly across the room as clothes were 
shed and limits were pushed and stars exploded and evenly matched, 
ferocious partners battled for top. And through it all, Lucrezia Noin 
chanted, &quot;thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you&quot; and dropped 
little kisses on every part of Sally she could reach. //Thank you, for 
reminding me I am strong, for bringing me back to my true nature.// 

Finally, Sally was left looking down at the beautiful woman she&#39;d had 
her eye on since they&#39;d met wearing nothing but a pair of thoroughly 
soaked panties and a sheen of sweat. //I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever enjoyed a 
lover as much as I enjoy her, want her, love her. . . .// Tender for the 
first time in their encounter, she gently picked Noin up and deposited 
them both on the bed. Slowly, and with reverence, her hands grasped the 
edges of her panties and pulled down. 

Noin made a faint noise of disgust at her ruined underwear as it was 
discarded. //Silk. . .oh, well, the ordinary laundry machine can be a 
miracle worker. . . .// She pulled the naked Sally roughly down to her 
and playfully kissed the palms of her hands, her elbows, her stomach 
before rolling on top of her. //So sweet. . .skin against skin like 
this. . .I never even imagined something this good. . .never even 
considered. . . .// 

She had considered even less what happened next. Sally thrust against 
her with hips and tongue, wildly, and flipped her onto her back again, 
grabbing hold of a foot in each hand. Noin wanted to fight back, loving 
the control she&#39;d been exerting, but something told her now was a time 
when it was all right to give in to her curiosity. //What can she want 
with my feet?// 

Sally saw the inquisitive look and smirked. Then she bent her head and 
pressed kisses onto the soles of each captured foot, as the other pilot 
groaned and bucked wildly. //Yep, moving to the bed was definitely a 
good idea,// she thought, as she saw Noin&#39;s head start to rhythmically 
beat back against the pillows. She felt arms wind around her, clutching. 
Abandoning the feet after a thorough tongue-cleansing, she began to kiss 
up well-muscled calves and thighs, worshipping with hands and tongue. 

&quot;Ah. . .ahhhhh. . . .&quot; //yes more more more up keep going up up more 
yes// Noin was unable even to think coherently. She didn&#39;t even know 
what she wanted, but part of her was screaming to her that whatever it 
was, whatever climax there could be to this, it was coming. //This 
closeness. . .so right. . .touching like this. . .don&#39;t stop never stop. 
. . .// 

And then, without warning, it was there, and Noin didn&#39;t understand why 
her body didn&#39;t fly apart into little shards to shoot across the room 
like a broken windowpane. 

Sally, seconds before this half-formed revelation, paused for a moment 
at the junction of pelvis and thigh to admire what she was about to 
explore. //Women are so much more beautiful than men. . .they take the 
world into them, instead of thrusting their world upon others.// Then, 
very deliberately, she bent down and licked the clitoris of the woman 
currently scratching bloody trails down the skin of her back. 

//I didn&#39;t know anyone could scream that loud. . .I guess she likes it. 
. . .// Sally laughed against the vulva she was mouthing, causing 
vibrations that shot through both women like lightning. Then, she 
proceeded to thoroughly wash Noin&#39;s labia, clitoris, vagina, anus with 
her tongue; she wanted everything; loved the taste of her; couldn&#39;t get 
enough of her. She moaned. 

Sally&#39;s tongue went mad and Noin thrashed and groaned and cried out her 
name. //Sally. . .never felt like this before. . .what is this. . 
.tongue lips heaven wet heaven stroke heaven clit heaven heaven heaven// 
She felt as if the rough tongue that stroked her so impossibly, so 
immediately was the world, and she wanted to take the world into 
herself, deep inside. She grabbed Sally&#39;s face with both hands and 
yanked her up to eye-level, kissing her hard enough to bruise. &quot;Sally. . 
.fill me. I want you to fill me.&quot; Somehow, she understood, and nodded 
once. Smiling the sweetest smile Noin had ever seen on anyone, Sally 
began kissing her again, softly, stretching her body over Noin&#39;s and 
nudging her eager legs apart once more. Then, plunging her tongue deep 
into Noin&#39;s throat until the purple-haired pilot felt she would stop 
breathing--and die happy--she thrust two fingers into the wetness 
between her legs, and began to pump, feeling herself on the edge of her 
own orgasm simply watching the looks that passed over Noin&#39;s sensitive 
face. 

&quot;Ahhh. . .yes. . .Sally. . .more!&quot; Sally added a third finger, and 
kissed her again, impossibly, more deeply. Noin felt herself floating on 
a cloud of ecstacy. Being filled like this; Sally&#39;s tongue deep in her 
mouth and Sally&#39;s fingers deep in her core, she knew completion and 
pleasure and self-discovery and power. 

&quot;Oh, Noin. . . .&quot; Sally rose above her, breasts hanging down, nipples 
stiff and hard, cunt dripping. Noin wanted, more than anything, for 
Sally to feel as good as she herself felt as Sally&#39;s fingers continued 
to thrust in and out of her, making her body arc into the touch. She 
reached up with arms and lips and latched onto a nipple with her mouth, 
fondling the breasts she found over her as she sucked desperately. //I 
didn&#39;t realize this could be so much fun. . . .// Pleasuring Sally with 
her mouth, and letting one hand roam down her back and over the crack of 
her ass as the other reached, stretching down to stroke her moist cunt, 
Noin joyfully explored. 

Sally was falling off the edge of the universe, and gasping hard enough 
to hurt her throat. Before all rationale left her, she managed to pant 
out something about protection and diseases and not wanting to hurt 
Noin, but even to her own ears it didn&#39;t make much sense, and she was 
pretty sure her partner didn&#39;t know what a dental dam was or even that 
lesbian sex carried any risks. She was clean, she knew, but she didn&#39;t 
want Noin to feel later as if she&#39;d taken too great a chance. . . . 

Noin mumbled something clearly meant to reassure against her breast, and 
then laid back sweetly on the pillow, removing her hands and placing 
them against the mattress. //Wha. . .?// Sally couldn&#39;t help but moan at 
the loss of contact with those inexperienced but eager hands. Yet, Noin 
was clearly trying to do something. . . . &quot;My god,&quot; she whispered, 
suddenly faint, and her hands stopped moving within her lover. //She&#39;s 
giving herself to me. . .but not like before; now she&#39;s. . .she&#39;s doing 
it because she trusts me. . .trusts *us*. . .to make it worth it. And,// 
looking at Noin&#39;s somewhat predatory smile, //she fully intends to make 
it up to me later. Oh, Noin. . .so much. . .I. . . .// 

Unable to express in words what the revelation meant to her, Sally 
silently began to lick all the sweat off her lover&#39;s body, covering 
every inch of her with her tongue, until she found herself back at the 
junction of Noin&#39;s legs again. And, with the attitude of one who is 
praying, she scraped the clitoris with tongue and teeth before taking 
the whole vulva in her mouth, opening herself wide, taking it in. . .and 
thrust her tongue up, up to the center of her being, sucking and 
thrusting and feeling the explosion between her own legs as her orgasm 
hit her and the world went up in flames. 

Noin, meanwhile, was firmly convinced that time had screeched to a halt 
when Sally&#39;s tongue had begun to seemingly dive for her center. 
Something was happening with Sally; this she knew, and even vaguely 
wondered if it was odd that she had come while not being touched. But 
that and all other thoughts were wiped out of her mind as she felt her 
life being melted and sucked out of her into Sally&#39;s warm mouth, and 
suddenly her legs shot out with the force of a small earthquake, and her 
eyes rolled back into her head, and she thought she would become 
delirious with the pleasure until everything was blotted out by a sharp 
white light. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the world came into focus some time later, Sally Po and Lucrezia 
Noin were sprawled over one bed in a small room, limbs tangled and hair 
matted with perspiration. Noin remembered the feeling between her legs 
right before the whiteness, and realized she had just experienced the 
first orgasm of her life. . .and she hadn&#39;t been thinking of Zechs. //In 
fact,// she pondered, //I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to be thinking of him 
terribly often from now on. I&#39;ve got. . .better things to think about.// 

Sally remembered the flash in Noin&#39;s eyes when she had kissed her that 
last time, and knew their partnership would never be the same. . . . 

&quot;Sally?&quot; 

&quot;Mmmm?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s only going to get more exciting from here, isn&#39;t it?&quot; 

//You bet, koi, you bet. Lieutenant Noin,// she thought, smiling, //I do 
believe I love you.// 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whew! ::wipes her tired brow:: The END!!! Now, I&#39;ve got a headache, it&#39;s 
three a.m., and if I don&#39;t get some sleep I&#39;m not sure if I can make it 
to tomorrow. Good night all, and pleasant dreams to everyone! ^_^
