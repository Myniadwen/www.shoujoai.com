<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sincrusader.html">SinCrusader</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Note/Randomness: I&#39;m happy. My eye hasn&#39;t twitched in an 
entire day. See, I had this problem the other day where the right 
corner of my right eye kept twitching--seriously, all day. I was 
starting to think it might&#39;ve been lack of sleep of something. Maybe 
it was just caffeine withdrawal, &#39;cause I&#39;ve drank about a two-liter&#39;s 
worth of Dr. Pepper today, so I&#39;m definitely not low on caffeine (*leg 
spasm*). Dude, I get the worst withdrawal symptoms, though. I get all 
bitchy and irritable, and I get these crazy-ass headaches. Apparently 
I also get an annoying tic. Or, hey, maybe it was paintball 
withdrawal, &#39;cause I definitely went paintballing today and my 
twitchy-thing is gone. Hmm... Speaking of paintball, man do I need a 
massage. Oh, what I wouldn&#39;t pay to be filthy-stinkin&#39; rich... Wait, 
that doesn&#39;t work. Anyway.

Show of hands, who cares about the SinCrusader&#39;s withdrawal symptoms? 
Yeah, that&#39;s what I thought. This is for all the ladies: Senorita, I 
feel for you, you deal wit&#39; things that you don&#39;t have to. He doesn&#39;t 
love you, I can tell by his charms. But you can feel this real love if 
you just lay in my arms. 

By the way, I&#39;m seventeen, got the whole tall-dark-handsome thang 
goin&#39; on here, and I&#39;m so single it&#39;s not even funny. I live in 
Maryland. If you&#39;re in the area, call me! (BTW, I&#39;m a chick.)

Okay, here we go...

---------------------------------------------

The door slammed closed behind Dorothy, the blonde having kicked it 
shut with one booted foot. Fuming, Dorothy strode up to Relena, until 
she was even with the shorter, darker girl. Eyebrows drawn close in 
anger, the blonde shoved the princess back a step, causing her to bump 
into the arm of the sofa. Relena fell back onto the armrest, staring 
defiantly up at Dorothy, who had drawn herself even closer and come to 
stand between the girl&#39;s legs.

&quot;You--&quot; she bit off in anger, poking one finger into Relena&#39;s chest, 
just above the girl&#39;s breasts. Before she could say another word, 
Relena stood up, holding Dorothy&#39;s eyes with her own. They were so 
close that they were breathing the same air, lips barely an inch 
apart. Their feet occupied almost the same space, neither farther back 
than the other. Legs were intertwined, and arms had no choice but to 
follow suit.

Breathing heavy, Relena drew herself up so that she could look Dorothy 
in the eye. Anger rose in the girl&#39;s heart, causing her blood to rush 
through her veins faster than she thought possible.Then, suddenly, her 
hand had found its way into Dorothy&#39;s hair and her arm was wrapped 
around the other girl&#39;s waist as their lips met in fierce abandon.

Tongues warred and lips fought as Relena tugged at Dorothy&#39;s hair, 
crushing their faces together. Not one to be thrown off balance, 
Dorothy allowed her hands to travel up Relena&#39;s sides, pushing her 
shirt up as their heated kiss continued. They broke apart just long 
enough for Dorothy to pull the brunette&#39;s shirt over her head, then 
fell together once more. Dorothy&#39;s shirt quickly joined the growing 
pile, followed by two bras. Relena&#39;s skirt fell to the floor, along 
with Dorothy&#39;s, and then their panties. Finally they were left in 
nothing but their shoes and socks.

The two girl&#39;s took a moment to laugh at their brash, wild behavior. 
Then Relena broke the mood by saying something to the effect of, &quot;God, 
you&#39;re hot when you&#39;re mad,&quot; and pulled Dorothy into another searing 
kiss. She allowed her hands to slide down the blonde&#39;s body, coming to 
rest at the girl&#39;s hips, as her lips continued their sensual assault. 
Dorothy groaned as Relena&#39;s hands moved farther down still, teasing 
the wiry hairs that began a few inches below her navel. Removing her 
mouth from the other girl&#39;s lips, Relena began to kiss and nip at 
Dorothy&#39;s throat. Before the blonde could protest about their 
position, Relena slipped first one and then two fingers within 
Dorothy, causing the other girl to tremble a little in her grasp.

&quot;I&#39;m gonna fall down...&quot; she managed to grind out between grit teeth. 
Relena just giggled a little and moved her fingers inside the blonde.

&quot;Hey, you know that one song...&quot; Relena said, still laughing a little.

Dorothy only moaned, head throw back just the slightest bit, and 
nodded as Relena moved her thumb to caress the blonde&#39;s clit. &quot;I know 
a lot of songs... God, Relenaaaa....&quot;

The brunette grinned, then finally gave in to her lover and let them 
slide to the floor, mere feet from the couch. She positioned herself 
over Dorothy, her hand still firmly occupied with the blonde&#39;s soaked 
sex as her other hand massaged one aroused breast. &quot;I meant the one 
where it&#39;s all like,&quot; she rubbed her thumb against Dorothy&#39;s clit 
particularly hard and sang in the lowest, growliest voice she could 
manage, &quot;I wanna fuck you like an animal.&quot; Dorothy couldn&#39;t laugh 
though, she was far to busy moaning under the brunette&#39;s assault. 
Relena continued, &quot;I wanna feel you from the inside,&quot; and stroked 
Dorothy for emphasis. She let up on the girl&#39;s clit, not wanting her 
to come too soon, and turned her attention to the interior in 
question. While her fingers stroked and drilled into Dorothy, Relena 
allowed her mouth to move down to one of the blonde&#39;s aroused nipples, 
suckling gently, then biting a little and licking.

Dorothy&#39;s hands were threaded in Relena&#39;s hair now, tangling in the 
golden-brown tresses that cascaded down her back, some of which fell 
to the sides and tickled at Dorothy&#39;s skin. But all that mattered in 
that moment was the immense pleasure the blonde was being subjected 
to. Nothing else.

Relena moved her mouth from the girl&#39;s breast up to her throat, where 
she continued her licking and biting, leaving a couple small bruises 
behind to tell the story. She could feel--and hear--Dorothy drawing 
ever closer to her climax. The tightening of the blonde&#39;s muscles, now 
on hair-trigger, soon to shift to spasmodic. Her skin, sweat-slicked 
and flushed dark. The fine hairs that covered her body, rising as if 
chilled. Her legs, spread and yet somehow clamped to Relena&#39;s hand. 
Her pulse, which raced against Relena&#39;s lips. Even her scent, a dark, 
musky sort of aroma, gave her away.
When she heard the blonde&#39;s moans turn to cries, Relena brought her 
mouth from Dorothy&#39;s neck to seal their lips together. Felt the 
powerlessness as Dorothy was too overwhelmed with pleasure to put much 
effort into returning the kiss, mostly just trembling against the 
brunette&#39;s lips. And suddenly the blonde&#39;s muscles made that tell-tale 
shift from hair-trigger to spasmodic, and it became deliciously 
apparent that she was very much in the throes of orgasm. But Relena 
didn&#39;t let up, still driving into the girl&#39;s sex, feeling the muscles 
continue to contract against her fingers, her thumb still massaging 
her clit and bringing random twitches from muscles that would 
all-too-soon give out.

&quot;Gooooodddd, Relenaa,&quot; Dorothy groaned into the brunette&#39;s mouth. 
Relena just grinned against her lips and persevered, feeling the 
slight burn in her fingers and wrist as the strain began to make 
itself apparent. Her blonde victim found she could no longer make 
thoughts into words, or even form coherent thought, so she allowed 
Relena to tear every cry she could from her throat.

However, one thought did make itself known in Dorothy&#39;s mind. I&#39;m 
gonna pass out... she mused. And it took all of her strength to put 
that thought into words, which she then said to Relena.

&quot;Oh realllyyy?&quot; the brunette asked coyly. &quot;Well, it&#39;s been an hour. I 
suppose I&#39;ll give you a break.&quot; And she did, slowly bringing Dorothy 
down from euphoria and finally withdrawing her hand.

Dorothy shifted, allowing Relena to settle down on top of her. 
&quot;Goddamn, you&#39;re too good at that,&quot; she commented.

The brunette laughed. Her breath was a feathery caress against 
Dorothy&#39;s neck, and suddenly the blonde was inspired to reciprocate.

&quot;Hey, what are you doing?&quot; Relena yelped as Dorothy flipped her onto 
her back.

The blonde, in answer, set her lips to Relena&#39;s throat, finding a 
sweet-spot just above her collarbone that drew a soft moan from the 
other girl. &quot;Come now, Relena-sama, you can&#39;t always be on top,&quot; 
Dorothy murmured against the brunette&#39;s skin.

The blonde&#39;s argument drew a soft chuckle from Relena, who settled her 
arms around Dorothy&#39;s waist. &quot;Mmm...&quot; she agreed.

Dorothy allowed her mouth to wander over the brunette&#39;s chest, 
exploring every little dip and curve fully. She paused to flick her 
tongue over each nipple, causing Relena&#39;s fingers to tense and dig 
into her back a little. Well, this should be interesting, Dorothy 
thought, noting the brunette&#39;s reaction.

The blonde brought her casual exploration to a gradual stop, then 
looked Relena in the eye and said seriously, &quot;You&#39;re very beautiful.&quot; 
The brunette smiled, acknowledging Dorothy statement for what it was. 
They had been fighting about this earlier--specifically Relena&#39;s 
self-worth. The brunette had a tendency to turn a blind eye to what 
other people saw in her, which drove Dorothy absolutely insane. 
Especially when Relena made it obvious that she thought very little of 
herself. Relena had been lamenting about how little good she could do 
for the world, and it was beginning to scare the other girl. Depressed 
people with no self-esteem tend to suicide, and their relationship had 
progressed to a point that Dorothy seriously questioned--doubted, 
really--whether she could survive in a world without Relena. So to 
listen to the other girl mock her own dreams and constantly put 
herself down had a profound effect on the blonde. She had been about 
to tell Relena just how much she meant to her when the other girl had 
cut her off with that first searing kiss.

So, knowing that to acknowledge Dorothy&#39;s statement and to let it go 
unchecked would be to lose the argument, Relena acquiesced and nodded 
just the slightest bit.

The smile that lit her blonde lover&#39;s face was well worth the loss of 
a little self-hate.

Expecting a flurry of kisses, Relena was surprised when Dorothy drew 
herself up along the brunette&#39;s body, allowing her skin to slide 
against Relena&#39;s, her leg to rub teasingly against the other girl&#39;s 
sex, and grinning as the other girl&#39;s eyes fluttered shut and her 
breath came shorter, faster.

Dorothy levered herself so that she was looking directly down at her 
lover. When Relena&#39;s eyes opened, she found herself face-to-face with 
the still serious-looking blonde. She moved to kiss the other girl, 
but Dorothy dodged the attempt.

&quot;Tell me what you want, Relena,&quot; the blonde said darkly.

Surprise danced across Relena&#39;s face for a moment, then she asked, 
&quot;What?&quot; not quite comprehending.

&quot;Tell me what you want,&quot; Dorothy emphasized, pressing her leg harder 
against the brunette&#39;s crotch.

&quot;Oh...&quot; The utterance was half-sigh and half-understanding. When 
Dorothy relaxed her leg&#39;s pressure, Relena met her eyes and answered, 
&quot;You.&quot;

The blonde smiled, shaking her head. &quot;You&#39;ve already had me. Try 
again.&quot;

Relena laughed. &quot;Smartass,&quot; she commented. Okay, she could play this 
game, too. Leaning up, she found Dorothy&#39;s ear and whispered into it, 
&quot;I want you to do to me what I did to you. I want to feel you all over 
me, inside of me, becoming me like I have become you.&quot;

Dorothy had thought she couldn&#39;t possibly get any more aroused after 
the pure satisfaction that Relena had introduced her to only a few 
minutes ago, but she was proven very wrong by what the brunette&#39;s 
words did to her. An emotion that could only be identified as 
anticipation flooded her entire body, soaking what felt like every 
pore of her skin. &quot;God, you&#39;re gonna pay for that,&quot; she promised. Then 
she allowed her desire to take over, and it brought her lips to 
Relena&#39;s hot skin, pushed her leg even harder against the brunette&#39;s 
sex, raked her nails along her lover&#39;s sides.

Relena&#39;s breath, which had already been coming quick and short, 
shifted almost to panting, and her pulse sky-rocketed. Hands twisted 
in Dorothy&#39;s hair and clawed at the blonde&#39;s back. She groaned loudly 
into her lover&#39;s ear as she was jolted from relaxed to aroused beyond 
belief.

Dorothy&#39;s lips found Relena&#39;s ear and nipped at it briefly. She could 
not bring herself to stop kissing the brunette, so this was her 
compromise. &quot;What do you want me to do?&quot; she asked, her voice just 
enough above a whisper to come out a growl.

&quot;If you haven&#39;t figured it out by now, why should I even let you do 
anything?&quot; Relena replied, her voice laced with a frustration that 
coaxed laughter from her lover.

&quot;&#39;Cause you want me to do everything,&quot; Dorothy enunciated sexily.

&quot;God yes...&quot; Relena said, pressing her body as close to the blonde&#39;s 
as she could. &quot;That&#39;s exactly what I want you to do.&quot;

And that&#39;s exactly what she did, starting by replacing her leg with 
her hand. &quot;Like this?&quot; she asked, feigning inexperience.

&quot;Yeah, right like that,&quot; Relena panted, moving into a rhythm with 
Dorothy. A particularly deep thrust coupled with a strong bite at her 
neck coaxed a sharp cry from the brunette&#39;s throat, causing her to 
rise up slightly off of the floor. &quot;Goddamn, Dorothy...&quot; she groaned.

The blonde in question continued torturing her lover, winding her up 
and then letting her down. She would observe Relena&#39;s actions, waiting 
for her body to become as taut as a bowstring, then she would relax 
her efforts and allow the crest to be end prematurely, frustrating 
Relena to no end.

&quot;Stop being mean,&quot; the brunette griped, pouting up at her lover.

Dorothy grinned wickedly. &quot;Trying to tell me you&#39;re ready, 
Relena-sama?&quot;

&quot;Oh definitely,&quot; the other girl purred, writhing against Dorothy&#39;s 
hand. &quot;Do you worst.&quot;

The blonde smiled now, a full-blown evil smile, and said simply, &quot;Oh, 
good, permission,&quot; before sliding down Relena&#39;s body and replacing her 
hand with her mouth.

&quot;God!&quot; the brunette yelped, muscles all tensing suddenly. She&#39;d never 
been more soaked in her life.

Dorothy&#39;s tongue was everywhere, moving from teasing Relena&#39;s clitoris 
to darting in and out of her wet sex. It didn&#39;t take long for the 
first waves of orgasm to flood the brunette&#39;s body, bringing every 
muscle to rigid attention. She barely noticed when Dorothy switched 
again, now teasing Relena with her hand rather than her mouth.

&quot;Sorry, my hand got tired,&quot; she apologized.

Relena, still in the throes of the prolonged climax brought on by 
Dorothy&#39;s mouth and sustained by her hand, didn&#39;t hear the 
half-mumbled words. Her breath had risen above panting and her pulse 
had won the race. She figured if it kept going like this, she probably 
die. But what a way to die.

&quot;Dorothy, you&#39;re gonna have to let up,&quot; she said, struggling with the 
words.

The blonde pouted, but complied, slowly to a soft massage. Relena 
rolled them over, laying down on top of Dorothy and clinging tightly 
to the other girl, her hand still caught between them and keeping up 
it&#39;s slow massage. Before Relena could protest, Dorothy sped up again. 
The brunette&#39;s nails dug deeply into her lover&#39;s arms, leaving welts 
and fingernail-shaped dents in her skin, as another orgasm tore 
through her body.

&quot;God, Dorothy,&quot; Relena growled, caught up in another wave of pleasure. 
She buried her face in the blonde&#39;s shoulder, muffling the moan that 
had turned into a subsidiary of a scream. She bit at Dorothy shoulder 
as she was rocked to her core, hardly believing she could take this 
much and still be alive.

But Dorothy continued, constantly building the intensity, listening to 
her lover&#39;s body. She had a goal in mind, she was working at 
something. The trick was to get to it without Relena passing out, 
which was a very real possibility.

And suddenly she&#39;d gone about as high as she could go, taken as much 
as she could take. Dorothy rolled her over just in time for her body 
to arch against the blonde&#39;s as a scream ripped from her throat, every 
muscle as tight as humanly possible, Dorothy&#39;s hand forced to cease 
it&#39;s torture by Relena&#39;s very body.

It came in waves, crashing over Relena&#39;s head so strongly that Dorothy 
could actually feel it. Then, all too soon, it was receding, all too 
quickly. Dorothy waited until the brunette&#39;s muscles had completely 
relaxed before she attempted to remove her hand, then collapsed on top 
of the exhausted brunette. They were able to haul themselves up to the 
sofa before they fell asleep, and they didn&#39;t wake up until about noon 
the next day, to the sound of Zechs--accompanied by Lady Une--pounding 
on the door. They answered the door in robes that Relena had scrambled 
off to find, not even bothering to explain away their state of 
undress, and the state of room. And neither Zechs nor Une asked.

But Dorothy did notice the blonde-haired man wipe away a slight trail 
of blood as he discretely kicked a pair of panties off to the side.

End game.

Post Author&#39;s Note: You have no idea how hard--and yet easy--this was 
to write. See, I just got over this whole &quot;situation&quot; wit&#39; my ex, and 
a lot of what we did inspired this. &#39;Cause you really can&#39;t write a 
PWP unless you&#39;ve been there, you know? But I ain&#39;t gonna dwell on 
that, &#39;cause it makes me depressed.

Anyway, there was also this debate about who to do it about, you know? 
I knew I wanted it to start off about these two chick who were mad and 
then ended up screwing... But I didn&#39;t know which two chicks. I was 
torn between Ryoko and Ayeka, Makoto and Ami, or Dorothy and Relena. 
And it really does just work better with Dorothy and Relena, &#39;cause 
they&#39;re both pretty enigmatic and flexible characters. I think I 
messed up Dorothy&#39;s character a lot though, and Relena&#39;s a little. 
Yeah, Dorothy&#39;s just to compliant and nice, and Relena&#39;s a little too 
sexy. But anyway.

OH--MY--GOD my shoulders hurt. Jesus Christ. Never, I repeat NEVER 
wrestle anyone who&#39;s like 99% muscle--especially when you&#39;re only like 
60-75%--on a trampoline until 10-11 PM and then get up at 7:30 AM and 
go paintballing the next day. Owwww...

I need to get laid. Wow, hormones. Haven&#39;t seen those in a while...

You know, I was supposed to go shoot some pool tonight. I was hoping 
to find someone. I even shaved and everything--cut myself too. All 
that effort and pain for nothing. Turned out I couldn&#39;t go anyway. 
Nyrgh.

So, honestly, what should I wear to homecoming? I&#39;m thinkin&#39; white 
pimp-suit wit&#39; top hat and cane. I dunno though.

Just remember, I got the magic &amp;@%$, my ass is like whoa, you got me 
crazy in love, I&#39;m headstrong to take on anyone, and I gotta stick to 
my girls like glue. Wow, I think I need to turn 99.5 off. Peace.
