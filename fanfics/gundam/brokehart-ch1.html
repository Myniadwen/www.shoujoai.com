<h1>Broken Heart</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mizunomouri.html">Mizuno Mouri</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I took you under my wing and protected you. You gave me your love and I 
gave you mine. We were happy. I was happy, but no more. That&#39;s the past 
and I&#39;ve been broken. 

I remember when we first got together. We were a hit with everyone. No 
one argued with us being together, Relena. I remember when you gave me 
your first kiss. I had fallen asleep on your shoulder in the limo and 
you leaned your head on top of mine gently and placed a soft kiss on my 
forehead. It was so sweet; I completely melted. I believe if it was 
possible, I fell in love with you even more that day. 

Your smile dazzled me from day to day. Especially when you would show me 
that smile meant only for me. I was so proud to have you as my own, and 
I know you were proud to have me. Everyday I saw you I loved you even 
more. My feelings grew and grew for you. Even now they still exist 
somewhere beneath my shell of a heart. They&#39;re there but they&#39;ve been 
buried.

You told me that you loved me from the day you saw me, before you even 
knew my name. Was that true or were you just pulling my leg? Can&#39;t you 
understand what you have done to me? The pain you&#39;ve caused. The 
heartbreak? Do you even understand me anymore, Relena? I need to know! 
Was everything we had for nothing? Did I love you just to have you break 
me?

I&#39;m getting ahead of myself. I can remember every detail of the day you 
said to let you go. It&#39;s so clear; it&#39;s like crystal. I had walked into 
your office; you were working on some business papers and told me to 
wait a moment. I did so happily, anything for you, anything at all. You 
finally finished your work and turned to me, a sad aura surrounded you. 
I instantly froze. No! Something is wrong, very wrong! I ran over to you 
quickly, grasping you hand and petting it. I ask you what&#39;s wrong and 
you say let go. I let go of your hand and once again ask what is wrong. 
You repeat yourself and say let go. I&#39;m confused, what do you mean? I 
stand up and begin to shake, you couldn&#39;t possibly mean...

My fears were confirmed. You gave me a whole entire speech, that I did 
not know you for who you really are, that I am completely in the dark 
about the *real* you. I felt the tears well up in my eyes and I turned 
around. You would not see me cry. I won&#39;t give you that pleasure. I 
spoke so slowly. If you wanted me to let you go, I would. If that&#39;s what 
you want, I&#39;ll let you go, no questions asked. 

So that how it was, I left her like she told me too. Does she even 
realize what she has done to me? I was her backbone, her support, but in 
reality it was the other way around. You were my support and backbone, 
and without you I am nothing but a pile of mush. You&#39;ve broken me 
without a doubt. I gave you my heart; my love, my soul, and you took 
them and shredded them to pieces. I&#39;m crushed, hurt, barely breathing 
anymore. Please someone just kill me. I want it to end now. 

Hardly a day goes by now anymore when I do not cry. During the day, I 
may seem okay to everyone but the moment I reach home I instantly break 
down. The tears come so quickly it&#39;s not even funny. The others have 
tried to comfort me but it&#39;s not working anymore. I&#39;m beyond comfort, 
what I need is release. 

Relena, I began dating you because I loved you and also because I had no 
faith in men. They had done me so much wrong that I never wanted to date 
another one. I thought that maybe with women I could be happy. I thought 
with you I could be happy, but I was wrong. I no longer have faith in 
anyone anymore because of you. My heart lies in four pieces now, broken 
and showcased for all to see. Wondering what those four pieces are? I&#39;ll 
tell you what they are: love, hate, pain, and sorrow. Those emotions 
reverberate throughout my body, but I know how to end it all. I&#39;ll end 
it tonight, Relena. I just want you to know that during our 
relationship, I regret only one thing. I regret never kissing you on the 
lips. Just once...

~*~*~*~*

Relena looked up from the note and looked at the gravestone. She walked 
up to it and placed a single white rose on it. She kneeled down in 
prayer, lifting her head to only read the epitaph:

Lucrezia Noin
AC 176 - AC 204
May she find the peace
she didn&#39;t find in this life.
Relena stood back up and brushed the tears away from her eyes, she 
mustn&#39;t be sad. She caused this and she knew it. There was nothing she 
could&#39;ve done to stop Noin from slitting her wrists then throat. It was 
all over; she had lost. Relena bit back the tears, she hadn&#39;t meant to 
let her go, she just didn&#39;t want to hurt her, but it seems she did 
anyway. She had challenged love and lost.

Moral? Love is a tricky thing to navigate, be sure to bring a compass 
when you get lost. *wanders off to write more angst* BTW Does this fic 
even make sense?
