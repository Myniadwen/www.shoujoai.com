<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/viper.html">Viper</a><br> </h2>
<pre>-Solitary girl I have been-
-Living in a cell made of skin-
-Sealed inside myself, nothing gets out or gets in-
-I can&#39;t feel what you feel-

Relena looked up from her computer. &quot;Noin?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Relena?&quot;

&quot;Have you ever kissed someone?&quot;

Noin stopped typing abruptly. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Have you ever kissed someone?&quot; Relena repeated.

&quot;Yes, why do you ask?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know really. I&#39;ve just been thinking a lot about my life 
lately. I don&#39;t mind being who I am, but I realize that there are so 
many things I&#39;ve missed out on by being so isolated.&quot; Relena picked up 
a pen, and began chewing on the end of it, frowning slightly.

&quot;Like kissing?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I mean, I deal with peace and war, and diplomacy and 
bureaucracy. But I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to feel another person&#39;s 
lips on mine. I mean, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s nice, but what does it feel like?&quot;

-Show me the way to my heart-
-Show me the way-
-Show me they way to my heart, baby-
-Show me, show me-

&quot;I don&#39;t know how to describe it, Relena. A lot depends on the person 
you&#39;re kissing. It&#39;s not an objective thing really. The more intense 
your feelings for the person, the better the kiss feels.&quot;

&quot;But you have to know what to do too, right? Like where to put your 
lips, and what else to do to make the other person feel good as well. 
How do you do that?&quot;

Noin blushed slightly, &quot;Well, you just have to practice. It helps if 
you kiss someone who knows what they&#39;re doing, and doesn&#39;t mind 
showing you.&quot;

&quot;Who was your first kiss?&quot;

&quot;Relena!&quot; Noin blushed more.

&quot;It was my brother, wasn&#39;t it? At the academy?&quot;

&quot;No, it wasn&#39;t. I, um, shouldn&#39;t we get back to work?&quot;

&quot;Noin, please. You&#39;re the only one I trust to talk to about this. I 
know you&#39;ll be honest with me, and even though you think I&#39;m some 
fragile innocent, I really want to hear about this. I know the basics 
about sex, but I want to know more than clinical details.&quot;

Noin blew out a breath forcefully. &quot;Okay, Relena, but this stays in 
confidence between us.&quot;

&quot;Agreed. Just tell me about your first kiss. Who it was, where it 
happened and what it felt like.&quot;

-I&#39;ll give you everything I possess If you tell me where you keep your 
happiness-
-I look more and more and I find less and less-
-I don&#39;t know what you know-
-But I make it up as I go-

&quot;It was another cadet at the academy. Her name was Amaya.&quot; Noin looked 
closely at Relena to judge her reaction.

Relena cocked her head to one side, &quot;Have you ever kissed a man?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;And? Is it different kissing a woman rather than a man? Which did you 
like better?&quot;

&quot;For me, it was different. Kissing the man was just kissing a friend. 
I didn&#39;t have the same feelings for him that I did for Amaya.&quot;

&quot;Did you love her?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I did. Do you find that strange, Relena, that I prefer other 
women to men?&quot;

&quot;No. I know that many people do. But to me, love is love, and it 
really doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s another woman or a man. I know that men 
can love other men too.&quot;

Noin attempted to not let her jaw drop to the floor. Perhaps Relena 
wasn&#39;t as naive as she originally thought. &quot;How do you know that?&quot; she 
asked.

&quot;Duo told me. He came to see me one day, and we had a long chat about 
love. He&#39;s in love with Heero, and he was worried about how I would 
feel about that.&quot;

&quot;And how *do* you feel about that?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m happy for them. I did think that I might be in love with Heero, 
but I talked to Duo about how he feels about it, and my feelings don&#39;t 
even come close to his.&quot;

-Show me the way to my heart-
-Show me the way-
-Show me they way to my heart, baby-
-Show me, show me-

They sat in silence for a while longer, each lost in their own 
thoughts. Finally, Relena spoke. &quot;Noin?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Relena?&quot;

Relena got up from her desk, and walked over to lean against the edge 
of Noin&#39;s desk. &quot;Will you kiss me?&quot;

Noin dropped her pen, and opened and closed her mouth as she tried to 
find words. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Will you kiss me? I know I&#39;m not beautiful like Amaya probably was, 
but you&#39;re probably the one person that I&#39;m closest to, and I want you 
to be my first kiss.&quot; She crossed her arms, and bit her lip as she 
stared at Noin.

&quot;Re...Relena...I....ah...I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good idea.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;Well, what if you don&#39;t like it? And I don&#39;t think that you should do 
it just to get it out of the way, or to see what it&#39;s like. It should 
be something that you truly want to do, and the person should be 
someone you truly want to do it with. A first kiss is a significant 
event, and it should be meaningful.&quot;

&quot;Noin, if it were you, it would be meaningful to me. When I was 
talking with Duo, I realized that some of the feelings that he has for 
Heero were very similar to ones that I have for you. I trust you more 
than anyone, and I think that I would enjoy kissing you very much. Do 
you want to kiss me, Noin?&quot;

-My fingers search for you while I sleep-
-Looking for something to keep-
-Help me feel what you feel-

Noin took another deep breath. Relena stood before her, waiting for an 
answer. She couldn&#39;t lie to her. &quot;Yes, Relena, I would like to kiss 
you. If you&#39;re sure.&quot;

Relena held out her hand, and smiled. Noin stood up, placing her hand 
in Relena&#39;s. She hadn&#39;t been this nervous for her own first kiss. 
Gazing into the shining blue eyes looking up at her, she felt her 
stomach jump with anticipation. She drew Relena towards her, letting 
her arms wrap around the other woman. Reaching up with one hand, she 
smoothed Relena&#39;s hair back, and let her hand continue down to caress 
her face. &quot;You are so beautiful,&quot; she breathed, moving her lips slowly 
closer. She wanted to make this moment special for Relena. She 
continued to caress Relena&#39;s face with her hand as she brushed her 
lips gently across her cheek. Patiently, she dropped small kisses all 
over, and paused over the moist, pink lips turned towards her.

She lowered her lips to Relena&#39;s, and felt her respond. Deepening the 
kiss, she drew the smaller woman towards her, holding her tightly. 
Relena&#39;s arms tightened around Noin as well, and she made little 
sounds of pleasure in her throat. Tracing her tongue lightly along 
Relena&#39;s lips, Noin felt the answering response, and sought out the 
silky softness inside Relena&#39;s mouth. Gently, wordlessly, she guided 
Relena, who was overwhelmed with enjoying all of the sensations. 
Tongues met, lips caressed, and they explored each other with growing 
passion.

Noin broke the kiss to trail kisses down the other woman&#39;s neck, 
licking, sucking and nipping as she went. A whimper of pleasure from 
Relena was met with a groan of delight from Noin.

-Show me the way to my heart-
-Show me the way-
-Show me they way to my heart, baby-
-Show me, show me-

&quot;More, Noin,&quot; Relena gasped, beginning to unbutton the dark-haired 
woman&#39;s shirt. &quot;I want to feel more, I *need* to feel more.&quot;

Noin struggled for breath. &quot;Relena, we should, we should, oh, god, we 
should stop.&quot; But, her mouth kept breathing light kisses along 
Relena&#39;s neck as she whispered the words.

&quot;No, please, no, don&#39;t stop. I&#39;ve never felt this way before. I need 
you.&quot; Instinct was guiding her, and her hand was inside the unbuttoned 
shirt now, making it&#39;s way to Noin&#39;s breast. Both moaned as Relena&#39;s 
fingers found a hardened nipple, and began to stroke it softly.

&quot;Oh Relena,&quot; Noin slowly pushed Relena&#39;s shirt up, and let her hands 
enjoy the feel of the translucent soft skin underneath. They drifted 
towards the floor together, lying next to one another as their hands 
explored, and their skin grew moist with desire. Clothing came off 
slowly as they let their eyes feast on the newly exposed flesh. Their 
kisses grew in intensity, and they pressed closer as they embraced. 
Endearments were whispered, and kissed into being.

-Show me the way to my heart-
-Show me the way-
-Show me they way to my heart, baby-
-Show me, show me-

Relena was overcome with emotion, and craved more. She let her kisses 
drift lower, taking one supple breast into her mouth, and lavishing it 
with kisses. Kissing down Noin&#39;s abdomen, she loved the feel of the 
other woman&#39;s skin next to hers. She slid back up Noin&#39;s body, never 
breaking contact. Noin&#39;s eyes opened, and she smiled as she looked at 
Relena -- hair mussed, lips swollen from kissing, eyes heavy and dark 
with desire. Relena smiled back, and leaned in for another intense 
kiss. Finally remembering to breathe, Relena buried her face in Noin&#39;s 
neck. &quot;Noin?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Relena?&quot; Noin struggled to speak, as Relena licked and kissed 
around her earlobe.

&quot;Make love to me.&quot; Relena pressed her mouth to Noin&#39;s again, and 
arched her body in need.

&quot;Mmmmm,&quot; Noin replied, moving closer still to Relena in response, and 
aching with want.

No more words were spoken as they let passion take over. 
Sweat-drenched skin against sweat-drenched skin, they moved against 
each other. Noin&#39;s hand moved between Relena&#39;s legs, and she slowly 
found her way through the tangle of curls to the soft flesh beneath. 
Relena moved restlessly, seeking more. Never breaking their kiss, 
Noin&#39;s fingers moved deftly, in and out, stroking, surrounding, 
caressing. Relena&#39;s hands ran over Noin&#39;s flesh, moving to her 
breasts, her belly, her bottom. Her senses stimulated to the breaking 
point, she felt a wave of white light move over her, and she screamed 
her joy as she dove into it. Trembling, and warm all over, she curled 
closer to Noin. Legs intertwined, they lay together as their heart 
rates came back to normal, and their breathing leveled out.

&quot;Noin?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Relena, love?&quot;

&quot;Is this what it feels like every time?&quot;

&quot;No, Relena. It&#39;s never felt this way before for me.&quot;

&quot;Mmmm,&quot; Relena sighed contentedly. &quot;Good. Can we do it again soon?&quot;

Noin laughed, and kissed her lover soundly. &quot;Yes, but let&#39;s rest a bit 
first, okay?&quot;

&quot;Okay. Noin, thank you. This is more beautiful than I ever could have 
imagined.&quot;

&quot;For me too, Relena, for me too.&quot;

Smiling, and still wrapped up together, they drifted to sleep.
