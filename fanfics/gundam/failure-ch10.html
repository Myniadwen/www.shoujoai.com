<h1>Failure of Vision (part 10 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rzrblade.html">Rzrblade33</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gundam/failure-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>&#147;You know, Dorothy, a lot of things have happened since you and I 
first met.&#148; Clouded eyes stared, unseeing, up at the ceiling.

&#147;So very true, Miss Relena.&#148; The same admiring voice that I always 
use. I&#146;m beginning to think that she can hear the underlying and 
barely concealed condescension.

She stares at me, her perfectly contoured eyebrows furrowing in 
thought, before she returns to studying the texture of the ceiling. 
&#147;Hm,&#148; she murmurs, biting her lip. &#147;I&#146;ve been thinking a lot these 
past few weeks.&#148;

You shouldn&#146;t. You shouldn&#146;t be allowed to think. &#147;You have?&#148;

&#147;Yes, I have.&#148;

I wait for her to say more but she offers no forthcoming explanations. 
&#147;About what?&#148;

She sighs softly and brushes her bangs out of her face. &#147;I don&#146;t know. 
You. Me. Us. Everything, really.&#148;

Pink tongue flicks out to run across her lips. I watch - mesmerized by 
the motion.

&#147;Well do tell,&#148; I say. I&#146;m surprised by the genuineness of my voice.

I watch her exhale slowly, closing her eyes briefly before reopening 
them. &#147;To be honest with you, I&#146;m not really sure that you want to 
know.&#148;

I probably don&#146;t. I can probably live without ever knowing what she 
thinks and be perfectly content. &#147;Tell me,&#148; I persist anyway. It seems 
like the thing to do.

She straightens her back and crosses the room to sit in front of me. 
Our eyes meet, and I can tell from the shine in them that I&#146;m going to 
regret this conversation. That I really won&#146;t like what she is about 
to say.

&#147;I&#133;&#148; Her voice fails her, and she clears her throat before restarting. 
&#147;I&#133;I think that I&#146;m in love with you.&#148;

Everything stops. Duo&#146;s words echo in my head.

You must want something else. Her heart, maybe? Although I think you 
already have that as well.

So I do. Maybe I&#146;ve had it all along.

Relena is talking again but I can&#146;t listen. I can&#146;t focus in on her 
words. My mind is too busy reeling from her first blow.

So you must still be with her for a reason. You must want something 
else.

Yes. I suppose that I must.

Her heart, maybe?

Maybe&#133;Maybe I&#146;ve wanted that this whole time. Maybe it&#146;s all I ever 
wanted.

Crashing. Burning. Foundation crumbling. A fire rages inside me, 
starting in my brain and spreading downwards.

She throws her arms around me and buries her face in my shoulder. I 
sit stiffly in her embrace. &#147;I don&#146;t know how it happened,&#148; she says, 
her voice muffled. &#147;I&#133;I used to hate you. But&#133;I don&#146;t know what 
happened. Now you&#146;re all I think about. I&#146;ve fallen in love with you 
and I don&#146;t know how.&#148;

She kisses me suddenly, and I let her. She must see this as acceptance 
because she&#146;s smiling when she pulls back. I want to hurt her, wrench 
her still-beating heart out of her chest, for making me feel so odd 
and confused.

Fool. Fool, fool, fool.

But who? Me or her?

&#147;You know, Dorothy, this used to be a game. You and me. One big game. 
But it&#146;s not anymore. It stopped being a game a long time ago, after 
the war ended. It&#146;s something so much more now,&#148; she says softly 
before snuggling back into my arms. &#147;I love you.&#148;

I make a desperate attempt to crush her in my arms but I find that I 
can&#146;t. My arms won&#146;t function, only lie limply around her body.

But she&#146;s wrong. The game - that beautiful game - didn&#146;t stop after 
the war ended. It continued. If anything it intensified. And I was 
winning, as I normally do. I always win.

But it&#146;s over now, with her nestled in my embrace, thinking that I 
love her too. It&#146;s over. And I lost.

&#133;one big failure of vision&#133;

I&#146;ve lost.
