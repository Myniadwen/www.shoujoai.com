<h1>True Protector (part 7 of 8)</h1>

<a href="../gundam/truprot-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>It took nearly two months to get everything ready for the wedding. 
Invitations were sent out, the great hall rented, and, to their great 
irritation, the media was alerted.

Releena smiled ruefully to herself as she peeked out a curtained 
window and saw the media mob in front of the building, and all the 
news trucks, reporters and photographers who waited for any word. 
Apparently, the marriage of &quot;Queen&quot; Releena was still considered to be 
news.

Thankfully, the fact that Releena was here to marry a woman wasn&#39;t so 
much of an issue to them. Noin&#39;s public record and her reputation were 
such that she was almost considered to be above any reproach. Of 
course, the fact she was the second in command of the Preventers and 
the very public defeater of the rebuilt Epyon didn&#39;t hurt, either. Her 
musings were interrupted by a soft knock on the door.

Dorothy smiled at her sunnily, as she closed the door behind her. 
&quot;Releena, you look good,&quot; she said, &quot;and Noin looks absolutely 
marvelous.&quot;

&quot;Dorothy,&quot; Releena said, and smiled a bit sadly at the very pretty 
blonde, &quot;I just wanted to say I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot; Dorothy asked.

&quot;Noin told me you once had a crush on me,&quot; Releena said softly, &quot;and 
I&#39;m sorry that I didn&#39;t notice you then. I guess I was just too 
wrapped up in Heero to notice.&quot;

Dorothy smiled and shook her head. &quot;Noin told me she told you, but 
it&#39;s OK. If I had gotten involved with you, I wouldn&#39;t have met my new 
girlfriend,&quot; Dorothy said cheerfully.

&quot;I&#39;m so glad!&quot; Releena said with a cheerful smile. &quot;Who is it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a surprise, but we will be there, holding hands during the 
ceremony,&quot; Dorothy assured her. &quot;Good luck to both of you, if I don&#39;t 
see you later.&quot; She moved to leave, then stopped and did one of her 
very theatrical turns, &quot;You forgot this.&quot; She handed Releena a set of 
keys, the keys that Releena recognized as the ones that belonged to a 
very nice sports car Dorothy had loaned them earlier. &quot;For the 
honeymoon,&quot; Dorothy said impishly.

Dorothy then slipped out before Releena could get over her shock 
enough to say anything. &#39;The woman always had a lot of style,&#39; Releena 
thought with a smile. Another soft knock, and Howard came in, a broad 
smile on his homely face. The former Gundam engineer cleaned up pretty 
good, dressed to the nines in his tux and tails. Releena had requested 
him to give her away during the wedding, in place of her departed 
father.

&quot;They&#39;re all ready,&quot; Howard assured her with a smile. Releena took his 
arm and they left the waiting room together as the soft sounds of the 
wedding march began to play.

Noin stood nervously at the altar, in her expertly fitted gray tux, 
Sally Po beside her as her &#39;best man&#39;.. She saw Releena walk up the 
aisle and felt her breath stop as she saw the white clad beauty. To 
distract herself she looked around at all the guests gathered there. 
Quatre, Trowa and Wu-fei actually looked pretty cheerful in their 
dress clothes, while Duo looked a little uncomfortable and a bit sad. 
Loosing Hilde had really hurt him, whatever his cheerful exterior. The 
oddest couple was Dorothy and Lady Une, who stood together holding 
hands.

When Releena reached her, she saw Une and Dorothy standing together, 
and chuckled softly. The young priest, the same one who had married 
them in the fake ceremony, smiled at both of them cheerfully and began 
the ceremony. Releena managed to keep track pretty well, smiling again 
at the use of Noin&#39;s first name. Noin, predictably, winced. They 
passionately kissed on cue, to the cheering of the guests and a roar 
of applause from the crowd. Noin and Releena ran together down the 
long aisle, the unmarried ladies gathered, and Releena forcefully 
tossed the bouquet of flowers over her shoulder.

They arched high up into the air, then dropped straight down into the 
hands of a very astonished looking Lady Une! The normally reserved 
officer blushed bright red, even as Dorothy stood by her side and 
grinned cheerfully.

Noin and Releena ran for the curb, where the infamous sports car was 
waiting for them. Releena passed the keys to Noin and they peeled off 
together for a honeymoon that would, hopefully, be more peaceful than 
their last one.

Dorothy and Une stood together watching the car speed away. Une saw 
Dorothy reach up and carefully brush away a single, shining tear from 
her cheek. &quot;Dorothy,&quot; Une said softly, &quot;why did you ask me to pretend 
to be your girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Releena would feel guilty, getting married while I was still single,&quot; 
Dorothy said with a shrug. &quot;This way, she can honeymoon guilt free.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Lady Une said to Dorothy with a quirky smile on her aristocratic 
face, &quot;I meant, why ME in particular, hmm?&quot;

Dorothy looked over at the beautiful, aristocratic lady and was, for 
once in her very eventful life, speechless. Lady Une reached over to 
gently stroke Dorothy&#39;s cheek, still smiling that odd, but very pretty 
smile.

&quot;Look me up,&quot; Lady Une said softly, &quot;when you figure out why.&quot; She 
then walked away, and Dorothy was surprised to notice the sexy sway of 
those uniform covered hips,

&#39;What the hell,&#39; Dorothy thought, &#39;you only live once.&#39; She ran after 
Une, and the two of them walked off together, talking.

The End

Author&#39;s Notes:

Why pair up Releena and Noin? They do have a history together, of 
course, as well as a great deal of mutual respect. And absolutely no 
sense in romantic relationships, as Dorothy wryly points out to the 
two of them. That&#39;s why she&#39;s playing the matchmaker. And, to be 
completely honest, it just sounded like fun.

Why did I break up Heero and Releena, Gundam Wing&#39;s &quot;perfect&quot; couple? 
I&#39;m sorry, all the Heero and Releena fans, but I don&#39;t think they were 
ever really together. Heero is, IMHO anyway, far, far too traumatized 
to enter into a serious relationship, while Releena suffered more from 
a school girl crush than anything else.

Why did I make poor old Zechs gay? First, the Treise thing: their 
background is never fully dealt with, but a lot is implied about what 
went on between them. Zechs also gets really, really focused on Heero 
during the series, to the point of nearly being obsessed. I suspect 
that Zechs, the last living son of the Sank noble family, must have 
felt the obligation to try to carry on the family&#39;s name, even at the 
cost of resisting or repressing his own true nature.

Where are all the Gundam Pilots during this story? Wu-fei obviously 
stayed on with the Preventers, Quatre is likely using his fortune and 
massive resources for the betterment of mankind, Trowa is still trying 
to live a quiet life at the circus, and Duo is probably out doing the 
Han Solo thing: a lovable rogue living on the edge of the law.

Where is it set? I&#39;m being intentionally vague about that. What&#39;s 
currently Europe, certainly, but other than that, hard to say.

Chapter titles are from songs by the group, Two Mix, who did the theme 
music for Gundam Wing, &quot;Just Communication&quot;. They also did &quot;Rhythm 
Emotion&quot; for an episode of the show, and &quot;White Reflection&quot; for the 
movie, Endless Waltz. I got the titles off of the CD &quot;Two Mix: Super 
Best Files &#39;95-&#39;98&quot;.

Jun. 13/ 02: Finished at last! Well, OK, not quite. I&#39;ll likely revise 
it a bit later, based on feedback from the readers.

Aug 11/ 02: A Dorothy Chapter! I wanted to explain her being in the 
Preventers, as well as add some background for Noin, Une and Hilde. Do 
I believe in this big &#39;Conspiracy Theory&#39; style explaination of the 
events of Gundam Wing? Not really. There is more than a bit of 
evidence to back up the idea, and I always felt Treise died a bit too 
easily...

I hope that you also try some of my other fics, if this one pleased 
you. </pre>
