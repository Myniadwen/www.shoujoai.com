~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

&quot;...but I can&#39;t help myself! He is just soo~ooo gorgeous!&quot;, Hilde 
explained, swooning. Relena snickered. This girl had been hit hard by 
Cupid&#39;s arrow. Hilde stopped being so dramatic and turned serious. 

&quot;So Relena, who do you like?&quot;, she asked raising an eyebrow. 

Relena blushed and began to stutter out a reply. 
&quot;Heero...he&#39;s-he&#39;s..um....well, I was there when he crashe and when I 
looked into his eyes, we just- clicked! He&#39;s real shy though...and-and 
Dr. J was a total heartless bastard for riding him off all his 
emtions.&quot; After her heart felt speech, Relena was left with a pink 
tint to her cheecks. 

Hilde giggled. And she thought she had it bad. &quot;Been thinkin&#39; about 
him all the time ne?&quot;, she nudged her in the side. Relena nodded. 
&quot;Even at night, eh?&quot; Again Relena nodded, then realized what she&#39;d 
done and blushed furiously. Her dark haired companion bust out 
laughing at her complete and utter embarrisment. Relena&#39;s eyes 
narrowed as she thought of something to get back at Hilde with. 

&quot;Hilde, have you ever kissed a girl?&quot;, she asked smugly. 

&quot;Yep.&quot;, she said while nodding. Relena&#39;s eyes widened. 

&quot;Before ya start teasing me about being a lesbian or somin&#39;, it was my 
ex-boyfriends sister. We got along pretty well and she thought of me 
as a sister. So, ya, sometimes we kissed.&quot; 

Relena gaped. She had no idea Hilde had lost a friend like that. Of 
course she knew that her ex-boyfriend had been a haughty Oz pilot 
corrupted by power, but to lose two close friends in an instant. It 
was horrible. 

As Relena was silently pondering about Hilde&#39;s feelings, the german 
asked her the same question. 

&quot;What-WHAT kind of a question is that!&quot;, she sputtered. 

&quot;You came up with it.&quot;, she shrugged then grinned,&quot;So who was it?&quot; 

&quot;NO ONE!&quot; 

&quot;Oh I bet no one&#39;s the name for her, ain&#39;t it?&quot;, she said slyly. 

Relena shouted in frustration. Hilde finally stopped teasing and 
looked serious. &quot;Can I buy a shirt that says &#39;I&#39;m With The Lesbian&#39;?&quot; 
For five seconds. 

&quot;Omae O Korosu!!!&quot;, Relena shrieked. The two girls laughed and fought 
the remander of the night and the next morning. 

The next day as Relena was going through a heavy stack of paperwork, 
she thought back to the night/morning before. &#39;Hm. I don&#39;t think I 
would ever kiss a girl. I have Heero, and I want to keep my body pure 
for him....but I wonder what it&#39;s like. How would it feel if I kissed 
Hilde?&#39; She threw her pen across the room and fell out of her chair. 
&#39;Where the hell did that come from?! I never thought about her that 
way!&#39; Her mind contradicted her, for she had in fact thought about 
Hilde before, but it was an overlap of Heero&#39;s face. &#39;Oh my God...&#39; 
She rushed out of her office in search of Hilde.

_______________________________________________________________________

As she walked down the halls of her workplace, she heard the distinct 
sound of high-heeled spice girl like shoes behind her. &#39;I recognize 
those anywhere&#39; She turned and called out, &quot;Miss Relena! What a 
suprise.&quot; 

Relena kept on running as if not hearing Hilde. She ran until she had 
crashed into Hilde, tumbling to the ground on top of her. Then Relena 
kissed her full on the lips, a hidden passion escaping from deep 
inside her. 

As they broke apart, Hilde smirked. &quot;I guess I&#39;ll have to buy that 
t-shirt after all.&quot;
