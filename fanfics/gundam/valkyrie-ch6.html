<a href="../gundam/valkyrie-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>	&quot;He did /WHAT/?!&quot;

	It was all Dorothy could do to keep from leaping over the desk,
grabbing the nearest, hand-held blunt object, and turn Heero Yuy /and/ his
Gundam into scrap.

	&quot;Miss Relena&#39;s already at the morning meeting.	I believe he
informed her before then.&quot;

	&quot;Oh god, Relena.&quot;
 
Dorothy ground her fingertips into her forehead, trying to think her way
out of this one, trying not to feel like the biggest fool in the universe.


	//What did I do to you, Relena?  I should have known, I should
have /known/ he wouldn&#39;t do it.//  

She barely resisted the urge to throw a marble paperweight on her desk
through the window behind her.	 

//That little bastard, how could he?!  What was I thinking?!  Now I&#39;ve
pushed him away from you completely.//

	The blonde paced back and forth behind her desk, letting all the
pieces fall into place, feeling little stabs of pain every few seconds,
burning guilt, knowing Relena had to have been torn apart by the betrayal.


//Shit.  Shit shit, it wasn&#39;t supposed to happen like this.  Not this
fast. I wanted him to think, I wanted him to trip over his own thoughts
for a while, stumble through his stupid emotions. It was supposed to take
him some time and, God knows, he wasn&#39;t supposed to do it like /that/!!//

After all Dorothy had told him about Relena&#39;s delicate hold on sanity,
after everything she had tried to explain to him - for Heero to just walk
out on Relena like that, to go far enough into space that there would be
/no/ way for Relena to even speak to him...
 
It was unimaginably cruel, and even in the moments that she hated him
most, Dorothy hadn&#39;t expected that kind of reaction from the Japanese
pilot.

//I&#39;ll never forgive him for this.  I&#39;ll never, ever forgive him for
hurting her like this.//

Nothing could have cinched Dorothy&#39;s plans as tightly as Heero&#39;s
rejection.  These people didn&#39;t deserve the blonde&#39;s understanding, and
they would receive no more chances to do what she should have done long
ago.

	 //The best thing I ever learned.  If you want something done
right, always do it yourself.//
	
&quot;Thank you for watching her for me.&quot;
	
The man smiled politely, and the smile increased as she handed him a small
roll of bills wrapped tightly with a rubber band.  There were always ways
around loyalty, around a security issue.  Money was one of the quietest,
most successful keys to any door.
	
Unfortunately, for the rest of the task at hand, Dorothy knew she was on
her own.  But she was filled with a righteous anger now, there was no way
even all of the Gundam pilots could stop her.
	
//All I need to do is get Relena alone.//

-------------------------

	&quot;Here you are.&quot;

	Relena looked up from where she had been leaning over the southern
balustrade, staring down into the churning sea, having thoughts that she
was sure would get her into trouble with Noin and Zechs, and possibly make
some other people very happy.
	
//It wouldn&#39;t be that difficult, to slip and fall over the side, into the
sea.  There&#39;d be no one to catch a person if they fell, and there would be
no way to survive hitting the rocks.  It probably wouldn&#39;t even hurt that
much.//

	She shivered, and was surprised to find a jacket over her
shoulders, the man who had approached her now wrapping it around her bare
arms.
	
&quot;You&#39;re freezing.  Maybe you should go inside.&quot;

	Relena blinked, returned to gazing at the sea without comment as
she pulled off the jacket, and handed it back to him.  After a moment, he
leaned against the railing with one hand, staring at her, the cool sea
wind teasing at his shoulder length dark hair.	

//Almost... almost the way it was this morning, with Heero.  A way it will
never be again... not ever.//

The memory of the past, and the sudden, sharp vision of her future hurt,
as if someone had stabbed her with a freezing sword. The man must have
seen the look of pain on her face, because his features softened, he spoke
to her in a low, almost compassionate tone. 
	
&quot;Tyse doesn&#39;t mean to get so angry.  He lost his little sister a while ago
during a battle that got... out of hand. It still hurts him a lot.  I&#39;m
sorry you had to see that.&quot;

	Relena blinked, surprised by his apology.  As far as she had been
aware, the meeting had gone like any other, with someone yelling at her,
accusations being thrown, and nothing being resolved.  The only difference
was, this time, she hadn&#39;t had to think of multiplication tables to
distract herself, didn&#39;t have to imagine any tiny Heeros or Dorothys to
stay calm.  

Her stomach and head still hurt, sometimes sharply, but there was an
emptiness now, a void lacking any sort of substance, gathered in close
around her, like a shell.  It kept a nice wall between her and the world,
so that she didn&#39;t have to think about anything.  Her responses were still
calm, and concise, still upholding the Peacecraft way of life, but were as
mechanical as the motions of some clockwork dancer, perfect and utterly
devoid of life.
	
//Noin and Zechs took over. I was speaking, and they took over -they
started talking for me.  I remember that, but I wasn&#39;t upset, I was as
calm as ever.  I didn&#39;t mind him yelling at me.  It didn&#39;t even hurt like
it used to. I wonder why they took over.//

	&quot;Are you all right?&quot;
	Relena turned, the man gazed at her, blue eyes full of concern.
	
//Blue eyes, but they&#39;re too hard, really.  Nothing like hers.	Dorothy&#39;s
eyes, so full of secrets... and mystery.//

	The thought, the memory of Dorothy was beautiful at first. But
knowing that the blonde-haired girl was only there, in the end, to hurt
her, that she had been placed at the Sank kingdom for the specific purpose
of subterfuge tore through Relena&#39;s happiness instantly.

	&quot;We&#39;re not supposed to be meeting like this, out in the open with
no one around.	As the leader of such a small country, you shouldn&#39;t be so
careless... the Sank kingdom could act against you.&quot;
	
The man grinned.
	
&quot;I&#39;m not worried.  I heard that you nearly ran the prime minister out on a
rail, so I figure I&#39;m as safe here as anywhere.&quot;

	Relena frowned at his teasing tone.

	&quot;The Sank kingdom cannot side with /anyone/ on this issue.  Your
country has to work out its differences and disarm peacefully on your
own.&quot;

	The dark-haired man shrugged.

	&quot;Not that easy, Miss Peacecraft.  We&#39;ve got to fight for what we
have.  If we disarmed, you still wouldn&#39;t be able to do anything, and
they&#39;d mow us down and plow us under.  They&#39;d be sure we were nothing but
a memory.&quot;

	&quot;War doesn&#39;t solve anything. It&#39;s impossible for a war to produce
peace.&quot;  Relena knew she meant the words, but they seemed to fall barren,
empty of any emotion, from her lips.

	&quot;I know that.&quot;

	The man tucked a hand into his coat pocket, pulled out a picture.

	&quot;Look at her...&quot;

	The little girl in the picture smiled happily into the camera, the
golden field of flowers around her was the same color as her dress.

	&quot;This is my little niece, Relena Tudor.&quot;

	The brown-haired girl tried to breathe, couldn&#39;t, and forced
herself to remain still, almost swaying on her feet.  It wasn&#39;t a
coincidence, the little girl&#39;s title, the look in the man&#39;s eyes told her
that.

	//They&#39;re naming their children, naming them after me.	Oh, I
can&#39;t do this. I just can&#39;t do this.//

	 &quot;We&#39;re fighting this war only because they&#39;re fighting this war,
Your Highness.	As soon as its over, the moment it ends, we&#39;ll disarm
completely, and gladly join the Sank kingdom in peace.	I look forward to
that day, and it&#39;s what will keep me going, until then.&quot;

	The dark-haired man smiled, tucking the picture back over his
heart.

	&quot;We want an end to war, Miss Peacecraft.  We truly want a world
with no war.  I just have to insure that my family lives long enough to
see it.&quot;

	With those words, he turned away from her, and died.  

-----------------------------------

It happened that fast, without warning, so quickly that Relena couldn&#39;t
even react.  The scream leapt from her throat as a reflexive reaction to
the sound of the gunshot, before she even knew what was happening.  It
hung in the air, as blood, bone and blobs of gray suddenly spattered the
front of her dress uniform.  The dark-haired man stood motionless for a
moment, frozen with Relena and the rest of reality in complete shock, and
then slumped to the ground.

	Relena could hear her breath shivering its way out of her lungs,
she heard her own tiny gasps of terror, but it was all strangely distant,
almost lost to her.  The Relena that was frozen in panic was just not her.

 
All her focus was fixated on the pool of blood, under what was left of the
man&#39;s head, the thick, red liquid slowly spreading over the gray-white
marble, sticking the remaining strands of dark hair to the balcony floor. 


	Relena drew her hands up to her mouth, threw them back down to her
side in horror, as she realized she was completely covered in gore.  

	It took only a moment for the scene to turn into total chaos.  

The brown-haired girl could hear screaming all around her, saw a few blurs
as people ran past, looked into the eyes of a few people who turned her
way, but she couldn&#39;t think, or speak, or move.

	&quot;Relena!  Relena!&quot;

	Out of a haze of shock, she discovered that Zechs was there.  He
was shaking her slightly, or maybe he was only trembling as he hugged her,
still whispering her name. Relena could feel Noin&#39;s hand on her waist,
quickly brushing across her body, making sure none of the blood was hers.

	&quot;Relena?!  Relena, are you all right?!&quot;  Zechs was staring at her,
his blue eyes were wide and frightened.  She thought she heard Quatre&#39;s
voice as well, but couldn&#39;t see him, and no more speak to any of them than
she could to Heero.

	//I needed him and he left me.	He left me.  Everyone leaves.  I&#39;m
afraid.  I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m falling, and there&#39;s no one left to catch me.//

	&quot;Relena!?!  Relena, answer me!&quot;

---------------------------------------

	Zechs swiftly carried her into an inner room, leaving her only
after Noin swore to stay by her side and a double guard was posted at both
the door and the end of the hall.  Relena fumbled with the clasps on her
buttoned undercoat until a pair of calm hands brushed hers away, quickly
undoing the buttons her trembling hands could barely touch. Noin quickly
rid Relena of her bloody clothes, carefully led her to a hot shower, and
left her under the water.
	
//I can&#39;t feel it.  I can&#39;t feel anything.//
 
She was still shaking, even under the nearly burning water, and though she
knew Noin was standing just outside the door, the brown-haired girl felt
as if she were the last person on earth.
	
//I can&#39;t feel the water. I can&#39;t feel anything.  I&#39;m still back there.  I
can&#39;t stop it.	I can&#39;t make it go away.//

	The last few seconds of the man&#39;s life played over and over in her
head like a record skipping, stuck fast on the same groove. All she could
see was the sight of him whole one moment, and broken and dead in the
next...

	//I can&#39;t handle this.	God help me, I can&#39;t.  I can&#39;t handle this
- I can&#39;t I can&#39;t.//
	
Relena stepped out of the shower, slowly dried off.  By the time she was
done, the brown-haired girl barely had the strength to pull her robe
around her, almost couldn&#39;t tie the waistband together.
	
&quot;Noin?&quot;
	
Relena watched her friend look up as she walked out of the bathroom.
	
&quot;Relena, I swear, it&#39;s going to be fine.  We&#39;ve sealed the palace.  You
don&#39;t have to worry, you&#39;re safe.&quot; The woman looked terribly shaken, much
paler than usual under her dark hair.
	
&quot;Nowhere is safe anymore, Noin. I want to see Dorothy.&quot;
	
&quot;Relena.&quot; Noin frowned.  &quot;Are you sure that&#39;s wise?&quot;
	
&quot;Bring her here.  Please.&quot;

----------------------------

	Dorothy took the stairs by twos, didn&#39;t bother with the spaces in
the walls of the west garden&#39;s low hedges and brick walls, vaulting over
them as if they weren&#39;t there at all.  She was grateful that she was
wearing her workout clothes, and not her school uniform.  Other than that,
her thoughts were an unintelligible blur of fear.

	A soldier&#39;s eyes widened as she passed, but she ignored him, even
when he called out her name.  It could wait, whatever it was, all of it
could wait.  Her heartbeat timed out the name that thrummed through her
veins, roaring in her ears.  Relena. Relena. Relena.

	//I&#39;m coming.  Hold on.  I&#39;ll be there.//

&quot;Dorothy!&quot;
	
She halted instantly as Zechs Marquise approached, his stern frown and
serious nature not hiding the fact that his calm was barely controlled,
and the edges of his expression were hedged in fear.
	&quot;Where is Relena?&quot;

	&quot;She&#39;s in the second chamber&#39;s guest&#39;s quarters, in the inner
rooms.	She requested your presence.&quot;  He paused.  &quot;Of course, you already
knew that.&quot;

	Dorothy blinked, eyes narrowing.  There was something she didn&#39;t
like in his tone, in the way his eyes flashed when he looked at her.  She
had found out about the assassination through her own inner channels, her
paid informants - and Zechs knew it.
 
	&quot;Do you have something you want to say to me?&quot;

	The duke of Sank looked up one end of the hallway, and then the
other, making sure they were alone.  Before Dorothy could move, he reached
out and grabbed the back of her head, wrapping his fingers in her hair and
nearly pulling her off her feet as he slammed her against the wall.  

	&quot;I guess that&#39;s a yes.&quot; she croaked, daring a grin.  Zechs looked
as if he wanted to break every one of her bones, twice.

	&quot;My sister has too much to handle already, to have to deal with
you.  Leave her alone, Dorothy.  Stop whatever scheme you&#39;re thinking of
before /I/ have to get involved.&quot;  

He leaned in close, she could see his Adam&#39;s apple bob, saw the fear-fired
hatred in his eyes.
	
&quot;If you hurt my sister, I swear... whatever it takes, I&#39;ll kill you.  I&#39;ll
hunt you for the rest of your life, and I&#39;ll make sure you suffer before
you die.&quot;

	A soldier suddenly appeared at the end of the hall, yelled his
name, and Zechs released her and walked away without looking back. 
Dorothy stared after him for a moment, slightly surprised, but annoyed
rather than afraid.

	//Great.  He&#39;s /exactly/ what I need right now. Idiot.//

	The blonde turned away, and continued running down the hall,
following the posts of guards, one after another, all the way to the door,
to Relena&#39;s side.

----------------------------------------

	Lieutenant Noin was standing at Relena&#39;s side when Dorothy walked
into the room.	Dorothy suppressed a silent groan of frustration.

	//Oh rapture.  Now I get to deal with the other guard dog.//

Relena looked like hell, the form-fitting silk robe she wore
overemphasized her already too-thin frame, and her hair was disheveled,
still wet and hanging completely free down her back.  

The brown-haired girl looked at her dully for a moment, and Dorothy&#39;s
heart seized up with fear. 

//She doesn&#39;t know me. It&#39;s like she doesn&#39;t even know me...//

After a moment, Relena gave her a pitifully thin, almost painful smile. 
Her voice was a husky, barren whisper as she turned to the dark-haired
woman.
	
	&quot;Noin, can you please leave us alone for a while?  I&#39;ll call you
if I need anything.&quot;
	
Noin looked at Relena for a moment in surprise, before her eyes turned to
Dorothy.  The blonde watched them narrow in suspicion, and anger,
containing a violence to easily match Zechs.

	&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s such a good idea, Relena.&quot;
	
&quot;Please.&quot;
	
Relena&#39;s voice didn&#39;t rise, but it contained a note of desperation, the
sudden, frightened sound of a woman at the end of her rope.  Noin looked
at her again, and nodded sharply.
	
&quot;I&#39;ll be right outside.  If you need... anything.&quot;
	
The dark-haired woman gave Dorothy a long warning glance, her eyes as hard
as stone chips, and walked out the door, finally leaving the two girls
alone.
