<a href="../gundam/shadham-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>It took nearly two months to get everything ready for the wedding.
Invitations were sent out, the great hall rented, and, to their great
irritation, the media was alerted.

Releena smiled ruefully to herself as she peeked out a curtained window
and saw the media mob in front of the building, and all the news trucks,
reporters and photographers who waited for any word. Apparently, the
marriage of &quot;Queen&quot; Releena was still considered to be news.

Thankfully, the fact that Releena was here to marry a woman wasn&#39;t so
much of an issue to them. The world wide legalization of homosexual
marriage as well as the eventual general acceptance there of, combined
with Hilde&#146;s public record and her reputation were such that she was
almost considered to be above any reproach. Of course, the fact she was
the very public defeater of the rebuilt Epyon didn&#39;t hurt either. Her
musings were interrupted by a soft knock on the door.

Dorothy smiled at her sunnily, as she closed the door behind her.
&quot;Releena, you look good,&quot; she said, &quot;and Hilde looks absolutely
marvelous.&quot;

&quot;Dorothy,&quot; Releena said, and smiled a bit sadly at the very pretty
blonde, &quot;I just wanted to say I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot; Dorothy asked.

&quot;That you&#146;ve had to go through seeing me marry someone else when you
still have feeling for me&quot; Releena said softly, &quot;Hilde told me and was
worried that you&#146;d be hurt by seeing our wedding. I&#146;m sorry.&quot;

Dorothy smiled and shook her head. &quot;Hilde told me she told you, but
it&#39;s OK. If I had gotten involved with you, I wouldn&#39;t have met my new
girlfriend,&quot; Dorothy said cheerfully.

&quot;I&#39;m so glad!&quot; Releena said with a cheerful smile. &quot;Who is it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a surprise, but we will be there, holding hands during the
ceremony,&quot; Dorothy assured her. &quot;Good luck to both of you, if I don&#39;t
see you later.&quot; She moved to leave, then stopped and did one of her
very theatrical turns; &quot;You forgot this.&quot; She handed Releena a set of
keys, the keys that Releena recognized as the ones that belonged to a
very nice sports car Dorothy had loaned them earlier. &quot;For the
honeymoon,&quot; Dorothy said impishly.

Dorothy then slipped out before Releena could get over her shock enough
to say anything. &#39;The woman always had a lot of style,&#39; Releena thought
wishfully with a smile. Another soft knock and Quatre came in, a broad
smile on his face. The former Gundam pilot and closest political ally
cleaned up pretty good, dressed to the nines in his tux and tails.
Releena had requested him, to give her away during the wedding, in place
of her departed father.

&quot;They&#39;re all ready,&quot; Quatre assured her with a smile. Releena took his
arm and they left the waiting room together as the soft sounds of the
wedding march began to play.

Hilde stood nervously at the altar, in her expertly fitted gray tux,
Duo beside her as her best man and Catherine as the maid of honor...
She saw Releena walk up the aisle and felt her breath stop as she saw
the white clad beauty. To distract herself she looked around at all the
guests gathered there. Trowa and Sally actually looked pretty cheerful
in their dress clothes having announced their own engagement not too
long ago. The oddest couple was Dorothy and Lady Une, who stood together
holding hands.

When Releena reached her, she saw Une and Dorothy standing together,
and chuckled softly. The young priest, the same one who had married
them in the fake ceremony, smiled at both of them cheerfully and began
the ceremony. Releena managed to keep track pretty well. They
passionately kissed on cue, to the cheering of the guests and a roar of
applause from the crowd. Hilde and Releena ran together down the long
aisle, the unmarried ladies gathered, and Releena forcefully tossed the
bouquet of flowers over her shoulder.

They arched high up into the air, then dropped straight down into the
hands of a very astonished looking Lady Une! The normally reserved
officer blushed bright red, even as Dorothy stood by her side and
grinned cheerfully.

Hilde and Releena ran for the curb, where the infamous sports car was
waiting for them. Releena passed the keys to Hilde and they peeled off
together for a honeymoon that would, hopefully, be more peaceful than
their last one.

Dorothy and Une stood together watching the car speed away. Une saw
Dorothy reach up and carefully brush away a single, shining tear from
her cheek. &quot;Dorothy,&quot; Une said softly, &quot;why did you ask me to pretend
to be your girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Releena would feel guilty, getting married while I was still single,&quot;
Dorothy said with a shrug. &quot;This way, she can honeymoon guilt free.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Lady Une said to Dorothy with a quirky smile on her aristocratic
face, &quot;I meant, why ME in particular, hmm?&quot;

Dorothy looked over at the beautiful, aristocratic lady and was, for
once in her very eventful young life, speechless. Lady Une reached over
to gently stroke Dorothy&#39;s cheek, still smiling that odd, but very
pretty smile.

&quot;Look me up,&quot; Lady Une said softly, &quot;when you figure out why.&quot; She then
walked away, and Dorothy was surprised to notice the sexy sway of those
uniform covered hips.

She ran after Une, and the two of them walked off together, talking.
&#39;What the hell,&#39; Dorothy thought, &#39;you only live once.&#39; She ran after
Une, and the two of them walked off together.</pre>
