<h1>Knight in Shining Armor</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/draco.html">Draco</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Have you ever had a moment where you could almost hear the music 
playing the background? Where it was so dramatic, you can imagine all 
the camera angles just to frame that moment? There have been far too 
many of those moments in my life. War, peace, those are big words. Yet 
it is those words that dominate my life. Sometimes, when I just sit 
and stare into space, I could almost wake up from my life. 

I have forgotten how to cry long ago. Someone once said there was 
something sad about a woman who can&#39;t cry. If that person had been 
talking to me I would have laughed in his face. Why do people always 
expect women to cry? Why are they so confident that we always the 
weak? I learned early in life that the only knight in shining armor 
that would ever rescue me, was the one in me. 

War mess up people&#39;s families, and after a while you learn not to ask. 
So I shouldn&#39;t be surprised when I found out Une didn&#39;t know I was an 
orphan. I think I act too normal for her to assume that. Funny how 
people always think orphans have to act strange somehow. 

&quot;We are here,&quot; Une&#39;s voice broke through my thoughts, &quot;Welcome to the 
Ministry of Diplomacy.&quot; 

As I stare into the garden fenced by a whitewash gate, I gasped. I 
didn&#39;t know what I was expecting, perhaps some brick building with 
concrete walls... but what I found was an elaborate European Mansion. 

&quot;I see you do not live in poverty,&quot; I smile, &quot;Can I get a map of the 
place? Judging by its size I&#39;m pretty sure I will get lost.&quot; 

Une smiles back at my joke, &quot;Maps is one of the more popular 
accommodations we provide. I will send a map up to your room.&quot; 

As she talked gate slowly glided open, ushering me in to my new life. 

I clang to my one piece of luggage like a lifeline. It&#39;s been a long 
time since I was nervous about anything, but I have never been in a 
place quite like this before. I swear the chandelier alone 
is bigger than my old room. 

The rooms in the building didn&#39;t have numbers they actually had names. 
Une carefully announced each as we walked past by them. 

&quot;...here is my room. I don&#39;t remember the name of it, something in 
Latin I think...&quot; 

I nod in acknowledgement, trying my best to memorize the route to the 
nearest exit. 

&quot;Relena&#39;s room is here. It&#39;s called the Princess Suite,&quot; Une explained 
as we walked past a rose colored door, &quot;This is your room. Since you 
will be her personal body guard, I thought I get you a room near by so 
you can get to know each other better without having a workout to find 
each other.&quot; Une pointed to the door across the hall from the Princess 
Suite. 

I laugh a little. Lady Une has a quiet sense of humor... she reminds 
me of the nuns. 

&quot;This is the Oak room,&quot; Une opened the door for me. I am tossed into 
the middle of the nineteenth century. &quot;Do you like it?&quot; Une asked me 
as she watches me gawk at my surroundings. 

I opened my mouth, but nothing comes out. I nodded quickly. 

&quot;Good. I will let you settle in. I will be in my room if you need 
anything. Dinner will be served around six. If you get lost, just ask 
a random servant,&quot; Une started to leave. 

&quot;Lady Une,&quot; I found my voice again. 

She turned. Waiting for me to continue. 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; I said clumsily. Yet it didn&#39;t seem enough... 

&quot;You are the best for the job,&quot; Lady Une&#39;s voice held no hesitation, 
&quot;I have seen your record. You ranked number one in artillery and hand 
to hand combat.&quot; 

&quot;Not just that... I...&quot; 

She stopped me with a knowing smile, and left, closing the door behind 
her. 

I stare at the door for a moment before tossing my bag to the side of 
the room, and collapsing onto the bed. God, even the bed is huge. I 
turn my head slightly and stared into the face of Lord Tennyson on the 
wall. Tennyson, the word echoes through my mind with a thousand 
emotions. It&#39;s moments like these that convince me that there is a 
God, and that He or She really appreciates irony. 

&quot;So we meet again, Beardie...&quot; 

/*&quot;Let me see the picture, Hilde!&quot; 

&quot;You will get it dirty, Molly,&quot; I defended my prized possession. 

&quot;Sister Maria said that the book was suppose to be for all of us!&quot; 
Molly complained. Of course she was too young to read the book. It was 
a very adult book, and only I was old enough to understand it. 

&quot;It&#39;s not a picture book, Molly. It&#39;s an poetry book!&quot; I explained as 
patiently as I could. 

&quot;If you are so smart Hilde, why don&#39;t you tell it to us,&quot; Ani 
challenged. 

&quot;Fine! I will!&quot; I never turn down a challenge. I plopped myself on the 
ground, and proceeded with my mature voice, &quot;It&#39;s called The Idylls of 
the King and other works, by Alfred Lord Tennyson.&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s an idle?&quot; Zoey asked. I sighed loudly. How was I suppose to 
explain this to a seven year old?! There is such a difference between 
twelve and seven. I can&#39;t believe I was ever that young. */ 

I opened my eyes slowly and regretfully. For a moment I can&#39;t remember 
where I am. After staring at Beardie&#39;s picture for a while, I finally 
realized where I was. I glance at my watch. Ten to six. Good to see my 
internal clock still works. 

I leap from the bed, and hop to the door. Dinner, my stomach rejoiced. 

As I opened my door, Relena opened hers at the exact same time. 

We study each other for a moment, finally she breaks the silence, &quot;I 
didn&#39;t know you came already.&quot; 

&quot;At your service,&quot; I did my best to resume my soldier stance. 

She smiled, &quot;Glad to have you here.&quot; 

She didn&#39;t think I could do it. I can tell. I guess she&#39;s used to 
being protected by one of the gundam pilots. Namely Heero. I fight the 
urge to snort. Sometimes I wish I could challenge Heero to a fight. 
Why the hell does everyone think he&#39;s better than me in hand to hand 
combat anyway? No one has ever beaten me in hand to hand combat... 

&quot;So what are we having for dinner?&quot; I quickly change the topic. No use 
trying to think of all the ways I can beat up Heero. He&#39;s the reason 
I&#39;m here in the first place. 

&quot;Fish, I think,&quot; Relena said in a diplomatic tone. God, I hate the 
diplomatic voice. It&#39;s the same voice the guy with the glasses used 
when he came to close down our orphanage. I hate bureaucrats. 

&quot;Busy lately?&quot; I try my best to make small talk. I have only spoke 
with her once before, and I feel infinitely awkward. 

She nods, without looking at me, but I could see dark circles around 
her eyes. I suppose there is more in that nod than I can ever 
understand. All my life, I have been a fighter, never a diplomat. I do 
not envy her. 

We arrive at the dining room, and I had to fight down another gasp. 
Evidently Relena&#39;s idea of fish was a twelve-course meal with various 
seafood dish already laid out on the table. 

Lady Une was already seated at the table, along with a couple of other 
people I didn&#39;t know. I sat next to Relena, and prayed there weren&#39;t 
some kind of seating arrangement. 

Lady Une looked at Relena with sympathy in her eyes. Evidently I was 
not the only one who noticed the dark circles on her face. 

&quot;Did the schedule finally come in for the meeting in Japan?&quot; Relena 
asked as soon as she sat down. Obviously dinner was just another name 
for a meeting at six. 

&quot;Yes, it&#39;s actually been pushed ahead to tomorrow night,&quot; a man in a 
dark-rimmed glasses answered as he eyed me questioningly, reminding me 
just how much I hated bureaucrats. 

Lady Une gave the man a sharp look. I could have hugged her. 

&quot;In that case, I will wrap up the report to the Preventers tonight,&quot; 
Relena said quietly. 

I don&#39;t know how I ever made through dinner without killing the 
bureaucrat with the glasses. And of all things, he&#39;s name is Bob. I 
tried to avoid all eye contact with him and focused instead on how 
Relena pocked at her food. Several times, I wanted to tell her that 
the fish is dead, but she didn&#39;t eat anything. I study her face. She 
looks skinner than she did at the peace conference at the end of the 
war. 

&quot;Is Ms. Peacecraft going to take any bodyguards?&quot; Bob asked suddenly, 
bring my attention back to the conversation, &quot;The terrorist group 
based in Eastern Asia has been pretty accurate lately.&quot; 

&quot;Leave her security manners to me,&quot; Lady Une said simply. I tried to 
remember my cover. Oh yes, Relena&#39;s new secretary or something like 
that. I suppose part of my effectiveness is my non-threatening 
appearance, and the fact no one recognizes me. 

Bob looked distinctly annoyed by the answer. Une glanced in my 
direction, her eyes full of confidence. I am really beginning to like 
Lady Une. I will protect Relena. 

/*&quot;Why do you always get to be Lancelot?&quot; Zoey complained. 

&quot;Because I&#39;m the tallest,&quot; I proclaimed, &quot;Besides, you want to be 
Elaine, don&#39;t you, oh Elaine the lovable, the lily maid of Astolat, 
guardian of my sacred shield!&quot; 

Zoey giggled, &quot;You are so weird!&quot; 

&quot;Can we meet Beardie someday?&quot; Molly asked as she gently stroked the 
picture of Tennyson in the book, &quot;He writes pretty.&quot; 

&quot;Sure we can,&quot; I told her, &quot;After we grow up, we&#39;ll all go and meet 
him.&quot; We might require a time machine of some sort, but I will tell 
them that later. */ 

My alarm clock rang off at exactly six am in the morning. My first 
impulse was to throw it against the wall. Deciding that the clock is 
probably worth my month&#39;s salary, I decided against the idea. 

With only three grumbles, I dressed and prepared myself for the 
three-hour plane trip to Japan. 

When I opened my door, the servants were already running around 
outside. 

I walk across the hall and knocked on Relena&#39;s door. 

&quot;Come in.&quot; 

I pushed the door open. Relena was still in bed. God, as I stared at 
her I could almost hear a low violin music in the background. The 
first morning light peaked through her window bathed her in a gentle 
glow. Her long blonde hair draped around her like a giant halo. I 
wonder if this is what the prince saw when... 

&quot;Good morning, Sleeping Beauty. Ready for your trip?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered as she sat up from her bed. The sheets gliding off 
of her skin. 

&quot;Thank you, Hilde,&quot; she smiled at me, &quot;For being here.&quot; 

I never realized how lonely she must be. No friends of her own age, 
dealing those dreadful politician day in and day out. God, what a 
sacrifice she makes to maintain the peace. I don&#39;t think I love peace 
that much to do that. 

&quot;Well, I needed a place to stay. Ever since Heero moved in with Duo 
and me...&quot; I see her cringe ever so slightly and I immediately bite my 
tongue. Oh hell, as long as I said it, I might as well finish my 
thought. &quot;You know living with Heero and Duo is the pits. I do not see 
how Duo can put up with Heero&#39;s possessiveness. And besides that, they 
both seem to think I need protection from big strong men. I decided I 
need to move out before I kill them both.&quot; 

Relena laughs, it was a nice sound, &quot;I will try my best not to annoy 
you.&quot; 

&quot;As long as you leave the protecting part to me, we will get along 
famously,&quot; I tell her. 

&quot;I hope so.&quot; 

Suddenly hurried knockings came from the door. Before Relena could 
answer, Bob rushed in. &quot;A terrorist group just taken some hostages in 
Italy. They are demanding to speak to you,&quot; Bob said in one breath. 

&quot;Give me a moment.&quot; Suddenly Relena looked twenty years older. Within 
a minute she was dressed and rushing towards the conference room. 
Guess terrorists aren&#39;t considerate about people&#39;s schedules. I follow 
them out. 

In the conference room, there was already a small crowd gathered 
around the giant monitor. Lady Une was the first to spot us. She 
gestured for me to join her. 

Relena calmly situated herself in front of the monitor, and began 
speaking, &quot;I am Relena Peacecraft. I was informed that you wish to 
speak to me.&quot; 

&quot;Relena Peacecraft,&quot; a middle aged man with dark complexion greeted 
her, &quot;Do you know who I am?&quot; 

Without turning from the monitor, Relena stared directly into the 
reflection on the monitor of Lady Une and watched her shake her head. 

&quot;No, I do not,&quot; Relena answered. 

&quot;My name is Jorge Nueve. I was under your brother&#39;s command in the 
White Fang before he betrayed us,&quot; the man smiled slightly. 

&quot;I do not understand what this has to do with my brother.&quot; If Relena 
was surprised, she didn&#39;t show it. 

&quot;Just letting you the know the irony of my presence here,&quot; Jorge Nueve 
smirked, &quot;Have you heard of our demand?&quot; 

&quot;Two hundred tons of gundamium,&quot; Relena answered. 

&quot;You have five hours before we begin to kill one hostage per five 
minutes,&quot; the man said without a hint of nervousness, &quot;Do we 
understand each other?&quot; 

&quot;It is physically impossible to deliver that much gundamium in such 
short period of time,&quot; Relena told him. 

Jorge Nueve&#39;s smile widened. He muttered something to someone off the 
camera. A moment later, another man brought out a teenage girl with 
short brown hair. The girl&#39;s face was covered with tears and her hands 
are bonded by thick rope. 

&quot;See her?&quot; Jorge Nueve pointed his gun to her neck. 

*BANG* 

For a few seconds I could not process what had just happened. Then it 
finally hit me. He just killed her. That *BASTARD* just killed the 
girl in cold blood. Damn it! Even in war you don&#39;t kill civilians 
intentionally like that! I feel my blood boil in my head. Suddenly I 
noticed that Lady Une was physically holding back from action, her 
arms placed firmly on my shoulders. 

My eyes flew to Relena. Her hands dug into her fist. A trickle of 
blood slowly gushed out... but her face showed very little emotion. 

&quot;You will make it possible,&quot; Jorge Nueve spit out dangerously, &quot;Five 
hours from now, I will kill another, and five minutes after that, and 
five minutes after that...&quot; With that, he abruptly shut off the 
camera. 

Very slowly Relena turned to Lady Une, &quot;Are the gundam pilots on their 
way?&quot; 

&quot;Wufei and Sally are already on the scene. Heero and Duo are to arrive 
within a half hour; Trowa and Quatre are will be here in three hours,&quot; 
Lady Une answered as she took a step closer to Relena. 

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we be getting the gundamium ready? He made it very clear 
that he is seriously about killing the hostages.&quot; I heard Bob&#39;s voice 
somewhere in the background. 

&quot;We do not negotiate with terrorist,&quot; Lady Une answered, but her eyes 
were still focused on Relena. 

&quot;What was the name of the girl he killed?&quot; Relena asked quietly. The 
blood from her hand landed on her white clothing, staining it with 
redness. 

&quot;Relena,&quot; Lady Une began carefully. 

&quot;What was her name?&quot; Relena repeated. 

&quot;We don&#39;t know,&quot; Lady Une finally answered. 

&quot;Can any one find out for me?&quot; Relena&#39;s voice was pleading, &quot;please?&quot; 

Lady Une nodded slowly. 

Damn it. I can not imagine what Relena is feeling at the moment 
because I can&#39;t feel anything but the anger surging through my system. 
In my mind I utter a thousand curse words. Yet Relena stood there, in 
the middle of the conference room. Blood still gushing from her hands. 

&quot;Let&#39;s bandage your hands,&quot; I finally offered. 

She looked at me as if not understanding words, but she nodded. 

The next three hours were all a blur. My mind just refuse to believe I 
watched a man kill an innocent girl in cold blood. At the same time, 
part of my mind was in awe of Relena&#39;s ablility to have some semblance 
of control. Damn it, she&#39;s just sixteen, she shouldn&#39;t have to do 
this. I stop myself, because I suddenly remember that she&#39;s the same 
age as me. 

As soon as her hands were bandaged, Relena begin to contact people all 
over the world to find out the nature of this terrorist group as well 
as its motives. As she moved from computer to computer 
tracing information, one would have never guessed that she just 
watched a cold-blooded murder. 

At the mark of three hours, the monitor beeped into life. 

When Heero&#39;s face appeared, everyone lets out the breath they had been 
holding. 

&quot;Mission accomplished,&quot; Heero said monotone. 

&quot;Any casualities?&quot; Relena asked quickly. 

&quot;Not to the hostages,&quot; Heero&#39;s voice revealed nothing. I am really 
beginning to dislike that man. 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Relena said graciously. 

&quot;Hn.&quot; Heero&#39;s image faded from the screen. 

Relena swung around to face me, &quot;We still need to get to Japan for the 
World Conference Prelimenary meetings.&quot; 

&quot;Relena, I don&#39;t think now is the best time to... &quot; Lady Une&#39;s tone 
was gentle. 

&quot;I need to be there, Une.&quot; It was the first time I heard Relena use 
Lady Une&#39;s name without any titles. Something passed between them as 
they watched each other. Lady Une nodded as she turned to me, &quot;What 
about you, Hilde? Are you ready for it?&quot; 

I nodded. If Relena can do it, so can I. 

The moment we were on the plane however, I regretted agreeing to it. I 
have a bad feeling about this. Perhaps its the female intuition I&#39;ve 
heard so much about. My fingers brushed against my gun. 

For security reasons, it was just me, Relena, and the pilot. I would 
have felt better if I was the pilot, but the guy who owns the plane 
knows me and flat-out refused. The plane had already been scanned for 
explosives and the works. Still, I felt edgy. 

Relena sat quietly in her seat with her laptop. I swear she picked up 
that bad habit from Heero. I tried to make myself comfortable in the 
small seat. 

The take off was smooth, but it did nothing to ease the tension I was 
feeling. When we were about five minutes into the flight, I realized 
we were not going the right direction. Before I could ask why, the 
pilot entered the cabinet with a large gun. That explains that. 

&quot;Changes in the schedule, ladies,&quot; the pilot&#39;s voice was steady, 
&quot;Obviously, just any hostage wasn&#39;t enough to get what we want. So I 
guess we will have to get the former Queen of the world to make a 
point.&quot; 

I study the pilot carefully. His posture was relaxed, he didn&#39;t 
suspect any resistance from us. I quickly calculate the distance of 
his gun. Perfect. 

My leg flies up and kicks the gun from his hands. To his credit, he 
reacted pretty quickly and took out another gun. My hand flew to his 
hand that held the new weapon. 

** BANG** 

The weapon goes off just as I wrestled it away from him. Air gush into 
the cabinet. Damn, who carries a weapon of that caliber on an 
airplane! With a swift twist of my hands I break his neck. No time for 
mercy right now. 

Lucky for us, there was a single parachute onboard. 

&quot;We are going to have to jump,&quot; I yell at Relena over the rushing air. 
Before she replies, I grab her and fasten both of us to the harness of 
the parachute all the while my mind blocked out the sound of her voice 
completely. With flowing movement, I open the plane&#39;s door and I push 
both of us out of the plane without hearing any of her protests. 

During freefall, all I could hear was her screaming into my eardrums. 
I am certain I will be deaf after this ordeal. 

When the parachute finally opens, she is still screaming. 

&quot;We&#39;re not going to die! SO STOP SCREAMING!&quot; 

&quot;DO YOU HAVE THE FAINTEST IDEA WHAT YOU ARE DOING?!&quot; She shouts back. 

&quot;YES! NOW STOP SCREAMING!!!! BEFORE I STEER US INTO A TREE!!!!&quot; 

In all the times I jumped out of a flying object, I have never been 
more grateful when we hit land. 

Both Relena and I took a long time to communicate our gratitude to 
land by bonding with the ground, lying flat on our backs on the lovely 
dirt. 

&quot;What happened back on the plane?!&quot; Relena finally gains her breath 
back. 

&quot;The pilot obviously wanted to kidnap you. I don&#39;t know why, but if 
he&#39;s ever gone parachuting with you, I can sympathize,&quot; I was not in a 
good mood. My ears are still ringing, &quot;I have got to have a talk with 
Une about personnel clearance.&quot; 

&quot;What do we do now?&quot; Relena looked around. We were in the middle of 
the forest, and we don&#39;t have any way of contacting our people. Damn, 
this is not good. And I hate critters. 

&quot;Let me think about it for a moment... We were in flight for 
approximately five minutes, since there is only forest to the west of 
our starting point, I&#39;d say... we are about 30 miles north of the 
nearest civilization and Preventer contact. I guess we start hiking 
that way. I have a little bit of food rations on me, but we probably 
will have to find a water source,&quot; I tell her. Hoping I sounded more 
confident than I felt. 

&quot;Do you think they are still after us?&quot; Relena asked thoughtfully. 

&quot;They might be,&quot; I answered, &quot;But there is really nothing we can do 
about it. It&#39;s a big forest, and they don&#39;t know where we landed. Our 
people will probably will find us first.&quot; 

&quot;What if they have dogs?&quot; 

I look up at her, slightly surprised that she considered that. I 
thought about it for a moment, &quot;I have a gun. I will shoot them. I 
will protect you.&quot; 

She nods, but she doesn&#39;t look very convinced. 

&quot;Now, let me see... North is that way...&quot; 

By nightfall we traveled around fifteen miles, and passed by two small 
streams. If our luck holds, we will be in civilization within another 
day. Something tells me though, that our would be assassins are 
waiting for us somewhere near the edge of the forest. For now, the two 
of us just sat in the middle of the darkness. 

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we build a fire?&quot; Relena asked. She&#39;s shivering slightly in 
the early autumn wind. 

&quot;A fire would give away our location.&quot; 

&quot;What about wild animals?&quot; She is more paranoid than I thought. Then 
again, I hate critters myself. 

&quot;In this day and age, the biggest thing that&#39;s going to attack us is a 
weasel,&quot; I tried my best not to think about it, &quot;These forests were 
cleared of large predators a long time ago.&quot; 

&quot;Oh.&quot; 

She looks very cold. I wrap my arms around her back, &quot;We probably 
should sleep near next other to keep warm.&quot; She nods. Her hair smells 
like lilac. Slowly, I lower us to the ground. Long blond strands pour 
over me like liquid silk. I pressed my ear against the ground. I have 
no idea if that will help or not, but animals do it, so why not. To my 
surprise, despite the hardness and the rocks, my mind starts to get 
groggy the moment I laid down. All I can smell is lilac as sleep 
claims me. 

/*&quot;Why can&#39;t we play today?&quot; Molly begged. 

&quot;Because we have no Elaine,&quot; I told her, &quot;We can&#39;t play when there is 
no Elaine.&quot; 

&quot;When will Zoey be back, Hilde?&quot; Ani asked, &quot;I miss her!&quot; 

&quot;She got adopted, Ani. But I&#39;m sure she will visit us sometime,&quot; I 
lied. They shot Zoey. She was playing outside when they were shooting. 
I told her not to go out, but she had to get her sandals. She left her 
sandals outside, and she had to get them. I told her not to go... I 
told her not to go... 

&quot;Hilde?&quot; Molly pulled on my shirt, &quot;What&#39;s wrong, Hilde?&quot; 

&quot;Nothing, Molly,&quot; I bit back the tears. I will not cry. I will protect 
them. I will not cry. */ 

I felt something shaking in my arms. Molly? No... Relena. 

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; I ask the girl in my arms. She does not answer me. 

&quot;Relena?&quot; I whisper softly. 

Still, she does not respond, and all I can feel is her body shaking. 

&quot;Relena,&quot; I repeated, more forceful this time. 

&quot;I&#39;m so weak,&quot; Relena muttered. 

&quot;What?&quot; I am sooooo confused. 

&quot;I couldn&#39;t save her,&quot; Relena muttered, &quot;She looked straight at me, 
and begged me to save her and I couldn&#39;t.&quot; 

It took me a moment to realize Relena was talking about the girl that 
was killed. 

&quot;Relena, you weren&#39;t even there,&quot; I tried using logic, though I doubt 
it&#39;s going to work, &quot;There was no possible way you could have saved 
her.&quot; 

&quot;But I should have talked him out of it. Talking is what I&#39;m supposed 
to be good at,&quot; Relena was still shaking, &quot;I am so weak!&quot; 

&quot;Relena, you are sixteen. You just went through hell, and your life 
has been hell for a while now I gather. Give yourself some credit!&quot; I 
have ever been that good at comforting people. 

&quot;Sometimes, I envy Heero so much. Why can&#39;t I stop seeing her face? 
God, it hurts. And I&#39;m so weak, I can&#39;t block it out and focus on the 
present!&quot; 

&quot;If you stop feeling, then you would be no better than those who pull 
the trigger,&quot; I tighten my hold on her body, &quot;Even Heero has ghosts of 
the people he couldn&#39;t save I&#39;m sure. He just hides it better.&quot; 

&quot;But he was useful!&quot; Relena&#39;s voice was angry, &quot;While I sat there, 
safe in my little office, he was out there risking his life to safe 
others!&quot; 

&quot;You are not a soldier, Relena. This isn&#39;t your arena, it&#39;s ours.&quot; 

&quot;Damn it, Hilde!&quot; Relena cursed loudly, &quot;I am sick of being the one 
everyone always tries to protect. I am tired of watching people dying 
and not being able to do a damn thing about it! I hate being rescued 
over and over again.&quot; 

She stopped for a moment, and then continued, her voice dropped to 
barely above a whisper, &quot;For a while I was romantic enough to believe 
that Heero would be my prince, and he would rescue the princesses. And 
I played the role of maiden in distress well. But that&#39;s not who I am, 
Hilde. I have watched too people die to be stuck in some ivory tower.&quot; 

*Four grave walls, and four gray towers, overlook a space of 
flowers, and the silent isle imbowers the Lady of Shalott.* 

&quot;Half sick of shadows,&quot; I whispered, &quot;You looked into the 
real world. Leaving behind an idyllic existence.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; 

I smiled into the darkness, &quot;Once upon a time, I think you were the 
romantic maiden. But now... now I think you have graduated to the 
category of the idealistic King fighting for his people. Sometimes I 
think you are holding this fragile peace together with pure will 
power. And I have seen your speeches, God, you handle those crusty old 
men so well I swore one of them was going to have a heart attack.&quot; 

I could not see her face, but at least she stopped shaking. 

Relena shifted slightly in my arms, &quot;Do you really think that?&quot; 

&quot;To take Duo&#39;s motto, I run, I hide, but I never lie,&quot; I informed her 
hair, &quot;There will always be meaningless deaths, Relena. You got to 
forgive yourself for not being able to save everyone. Trust me I 
know.&quot; 

&quot;She was so young and pretty...&quot; Relena whispered. 

&quot;Remember her then, and don&#39;t let her death be in vain,&quot; my voice was 
blunt. 

She was silent for a moment. 

&quot;Can I ask you a personal question?&quot; Relena finally spoke again. 

&quot;Sure.&quot; I have nothing to hide. 

&quot;Did you ever love Duo?&quot; 

That came out of nowhere, but I guess she&#39;s been wondering about that. 
Most people do. For once in my life, I considered the question 
carefully before I answered her, &quot;Yes. I still love him. But I have 
never been in love with him. He made me realize what I was fighting 
for. In a time of war, he offered kindness. I also loved his strength, 
he was someone who I thought I could love without the risk of him 
dying on me.&quot; 

&quot;So why did you move out from his apartment?&quot; Relena asked softly. I 
had to strain to hear her. 

&quot;I already told you, I couldn&#39;t stand Heero,&quot; I answer immediately, 
&quot;My entire life I have always been fighting. I think in some ways I am 
a better soldier than Heero. But Duo and Heero both seem to think that 
I need protection. It was just getting annoying.&quot; 

&quot;Oh,&quot; Relena&#39;s voice sounded surprised, &quot;I don&#39;t think I was in love 
with Heero either. I think I fell in love with his strength too. He 
had so much control of his life when everyone but me decided my fate.&quot; 

&quot;Sad, isn&#39;t it,&quot; I suddenly start to laugh. 

&quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;I think everyone thinks we are in love with those two gundam pilots,&quot; 
I continue to laugh at the stupidity of it all, &quot;For some reason 
because we are women we are expected to fall for a couple of 
terrorist because they saved our lives once.&quot; 

Relena leaned closer towards me, &quot;Thank you, Hilde.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; 

/*I watch the car drive away and continued to wave at it. Finally, 
someone adopted Ani and Molly. Now, I can go without hesitation. 

&quot;Are you sure you want to join the army, Hilde?&quot; Sister Maria asked 
me. 

&quot;Yes, Sister. I have to protect our home,&quot; I can not take my eyes away 
from the car as it was starting to fade in a distance. 

&quot;Is the great Lancelot protecting the ladies,&quot; Sister Maria teases me 
gently. 

&quot;Always, Sister, always.&quot; */ 

Relena and I try to make small talk as we hiked. I am pretty impressed 
at what good physical shape she&#39;s in. 

&quot;So why did you join the military?&quot; Relena asked suddenly. 

&quot;I wanted to protect my home,&quot; I reply simply. 

&quot;Was it hard to leave the orphanage?&quot; I told her a little it about my 
life at the orphanage to pass the time. 

&quot;Not really. A bureaucrat came to close the orphanage. My favorite 
Sisters left to be nurses for the colonies, and an old couple adopted 
my two best friends. There wasn&#39;t much to leave behind.&quot; 

&quot;I hate bureaucrats,&quot; Relena suddenly muttered underneath their 
breath, &quot;Sometimes I almost wish Lady Une would take a gun and 
threaten them come to an agreement over something petty.&quot; 

&quot;I swear they make an effort to be annoying,&quot; I agreed, &quot;God, at 
dinner the other night, for a couple of moments there I thought I was 
going to kill Bob. That man looks like a giant mosquito.&quot; 

Relena stops walking for a moment to think about what I said, and 
suddenly starts laughing, &quot;I always thought he reminded me of 
something! Gosh, I wish I didn&#39;t have to be polite with him and tell 
him that.&quot; 

I smile at her. It&#39;s good to see her actually laughing. There was a 
pleasant ring to her laughter. 

&quot;You should. The way some guys act, you&#39;d swear they think they are 
God&#39;s gift to women. I make it a point to tell them they are not,&quot; I 
definitely need to give her some advice to boost her feminist 
tendencies, &quot;Besides, I&#39;m much more chivalrous than they will ever be. 
I used to call myself Lancelot.&quot; 

Relena stops for a moment, and looks at me carefully, &quot;Why? Because a 
bunch of women throw themselves at you?&quot; 

I laugh, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind if they did. It&#39;d boost my ego. But no, to 
date, no female has thrown herself at me. It&#39;s just that we used to 
pretend we were in Camelot back in the orphanage. And I&#39;d always 
pretended to be Lancelot.&quot; 

&quot;That sounds like fun,&quot; Relena looks slight dreamy. I guess growing up 
as a diplomat&#39;s daughter she never had much a childhood like I did. Oh 
hell, we are still young enough, we can still play pretend games. 

&quot;We can play right now. I will be Lancelot. Who do you want to be?&quot; I 
ask her, &quot;It will help us to pass the time.&quot; 

&quot;Arthur. Definitely Arthur. All the women of Camelot are too weak for 
my taste,&quot; Relena answered thoughtfully, &quot;Does that mean I get to 
order you around?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, your majesty. I am bonded by oath to you,&quot; I make a dramatic 
bow, &quot;Besides, your wife is cute!&quot; 

&quot;Lancelot, I am shocked, shocked you should speak of your Queen in 
such a manner,&quot; Relena throw her hands back to demonstrate her dismay. 
She was really getting into it. 

We were starting to argue who was a better knight when I stop Relena 
in her tracks. I hear something in ahead of us. 

&quot;Get down!&quot; I push her down as bullets fly by us. 

Damn. I grab Relena and rolled us behind a tree. 

My eyes scan the forest, there! I see our snipers. I aim my gun 
carefully. 

**BANG** 

One of them falls to the ground. 

Relena stares at me. 

&quot;I am a soldier, Relena. And I am well trained.&quot; I aim my gun again. 

**BANG** Got another one. Obviously these men do not realize in 
combats without Mobile Suits, I am the best. If I wasn&#39;t being shot 
at, I would start gloating at Heero. I doubt even the perfect soldier 
has my aim. 

A bullet penetrates my left shoulder. Damn. There goes that. 

&quot;Hilde!&quot; Relena cried. 

&quot;I&#39;ll live,&quot; I tell her, as I take down the last sniper. 

Hmmm, only three. That means they are probably spread out looking for 
us. These three probably already told their friends our location 
though. We got to keep on moving. The pain suddenly hit me, and I 
slide on to the ground. Damn it. I think they hit an artery. 

&quot;Hilde!&quot; Relena cradles me in her arms. 

&quot;I&#39;m losing too much blood to move around effectively,&quot;
I 
tell her, as I hand her my spare gun, &quot;Here is a chance for you to 
prove just how strong you are. Keep moving, we are almost at a 
Preventer station. And if anyone tries to shoot you. Shoot to kill.&quot; 

&quot;What are you talking about Hilde?&quot; Relena demanded. 

&quot;They are shooting to kill, Relena. I think they gave up the 
kidnapping idea...&quot; I cringe. Okay, so maybe Heero is better at 
ignoring pain, &quot;And our current location has probably been exposed to 
the enemy. You need to keep moving.&quot; 

&quot;What about you?&quot; 

&quot;I will try to hold them back,&quot; I wave my gun slightly. 

&quot;I am not leaving you behind!&quot; Relena was stern. 

&quot;If you stay, we both die,&quot; I kept my own voice calm. 

Before I realize what she was doing, she picked me up on her back. 

&quot;Now hardly seems the time for piggy back rides...&quot; 

&quot;Shut up, Hilde,&quot; Relena commanded, as she begins to walk with me on 
her back. 

&quot;What the hell do you think you are doing?&quot; I demanded. 

&quot;Being Relena,&quot; her voice was steady. 

I would have argued more, but a sudden gush of blood came into my 
mouth and I had to swallow so I wouldn&#39;t spit up blood on Relena. My 
head feels very light... 

Waking up was very painful. For some reason every part of my body 
hurt, especially my shoulder. I am not dead, what a surprise. 

Tentatively, I opened an eye. 

&quot;You are awake,&quot; Lady Une greeted me. 

&quot;What happened?&quot; 

&quot;You have been unconcious for about three days,&quot; Lady Une explained. 

&quot;How did I get here?&quot; I wondered. 

&quot;Relena half carried, but mostly dragged you for two miles,&quot; Lady Une 
informed me with a smile. 

Yep, that would explain why my whole body hurts. Damn, that woman must 
have dragged me over ever single rock every created. 

&quot;She is an amazing woman,&quot; Lady Une said thoughtfully. 

&quot;Yep, that she certainly is,&quot; I concurred. What do you know, Arthur 
saved Lancelot. 

&quot;She wanted to be here when you woke up, but she has a speech to make 
right now. You want to watch?&quot; Lady Une asked as she stepped closer to 
the TV. 

&quot;Sure,&quot; I smile. 

Relena was wearing that white outfit of hers and looking very 
handsome. 

&quot;...we will not give in to temptation of war. Countless people have 
paid with their lives to get us here. We will not allow their 
sacrifice be in vain. Today, we stand together for peace...&quot; 

*The king drew in the petty princedom under him, fought, and 
in twelve great battles overcame the heathen hordes, and made a realm 
and reign&#39;d. *

I watch Relena glide across the dance floor in her blue medieval 
dress. 

All night, she has been dancing with those crusty old guys she spent 
so long fighting against. 

Time to rescue my King. 

&quot;May I cut in?&quot; I ask the Chancellor of L3. 

&quot;Of course,&quot; He replies as curtly as he can. Surprised to see a girl 
not wearing a dress. I tried a dress, I really did, but I tripped. 

I take Relena into my arms and whisper into her hair, &quot;You look 
beautiful.&quot; 

&quot;Has my knight come to rescue his king?&quot; Relena teased. 

I take her hand and gently squeezed it. 

&quot;Nope, I&#39;m just here to demand you elope with me immediately,&quot; I 
inform her. 

She giggles. 

&quot;You know it occurs to me, I might be turning gay after living with 
Heero and Duo for so long, because my King is beginning to look good 
to me,&quot; I whisper into her ears. &quot;I wonder how Heero ever let you slip 
away.&quot; 

Relena looked slightly startled at my remark but she does not draw 
away. Her hands tighten around mine. 

&quot;Have you ever had a moment where you could almost hear the music 
playing the background? Where it was so dramatic, you can imagine all 
the camera angles just to frame that moment?&quot; 

Relena nods in my arms. 

&quot;There has been too many of those moments in my life,&quot; I tell her, &quot;So 
I decided, I might as well make one of those moments last. There are 
twelve cameras on us right now.&quot; 

She looks around, alarmed. At the side of the room, Lady Une winks at 
us. Sometimes I get the feeling she knows all this was going to 
happen. 

The waltz stops, replaced by an old earth song. 

&quot;And I even found a song. It&#39;s not perfect, but it will do,&quot; 
I drew her even closer to me, &quot;For both of us.&quot; 

When it&#39;s love you give (I&#39;ll be a man of good faith)
Then in love you live (I&#39;ll make a stand, I won&#39;t break)
I&#39;ll be the rock you can build on
Be there when you&#39;re old, to have and to hold 

When there&#39;s love inside (I swear I&#39;ll always be strong)
Then there&#39;s a reason why (I&#39;ll prove to you we belong)
I&#39;ll be the wall that protects you
From the wind and the rain
From the hurt and pain. 

Let&#39;s make it all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
&#39;Cause when it&#39;s all for one it&#39;s one for all
When there&#39;s someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love
When it&#39;s love you make (I&#39;ll be the fire in your night)
Then it&#39;s love you take (I will defend, I will fight)
I&#39;ll be there when you need me.
When honour&#39;s at stake, this vow I will make 

That it&#39;s all for one and all for love
Let the one be the one you want
The one you need
&#39;Cause when it&#39;s all for one it&#39;s one for all
When there&#39;s someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love 

Don&#39;t lay our love to rest
&#39;Cause we could stand up to your test
We got everything and more than we had planned
More than the rivers that run the land
We&#39;ve got it all in our hands 

Now it&#39;s all for one and all for love (It&#39;s all for love)
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
&#39;Cause when it&#39;s all for one it&#39;s one for all (It&#39;s one for all)
When there&#39;s someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
When there&#39;s someone that you want
When there&#39;s someone that you need
Let&#39;s make it all, all for one and all for love.

I love Tennyson, in case you couldn&#39;t tell. I took massive amounts of 
quotes from his poems including Lady of Shalott, and passages from The 
Idylls of the King.
