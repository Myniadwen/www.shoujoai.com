<pre>Hilde embraced the sobbing Cathrine in her dark bedroom and rubbed her 
back soothingly. 

&quot;It&#39;s alright, it&#39;s alright, I&#39;m here now. Don&#39;t cry now, koi. Shh, 
shh.&quot; 

&quot;Hilde, I&#39;m so sorry. I&#39;m so sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to say those things 
to you over the phone. I. I.,&quot; Cathrine began racking with sobs again. 

&quot;Cathrine, I should be the one apologizing for putting down the phone 
on you.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s all my fault! I shouldn&#39;t have lashed out like that. I shouldn&#39;t 
have accused you dating that Relena Queen of the World, Vice Prime 
Minister woman. Oh why did I say that? I&#39;m so sorry.&quot; Cathrine hugged 
Hilde tighter, not wanting to let go. 

Hilde sighed. She shouldn&#39;t have told Cathrine about the dinner she 
had with Relena. It&#39;s already bad enough that she was always with the 
Vice-Prime Minister as she was her bodyguard. But what can she do 
about that? It was her job after all. 

Earlier that night, she called her girlfriend Cathrine just to check 
her out and say goodnight. Cathrine was all too excited about her call 
and insisted her to tell her about what has been happening with her 
and her job. Hilde, not wanting for Cathrine to worry about her since 
she was bored as hell, told her the most fun events that happened to 
her. And she only could think about was the dinner she had with Relena 
where they talked and laughed about so many things. 

That was when Cathrine&#39;s green-eyed monster woke up. 

It started with a simple teasing from Cathrine that Hilde just laughed 
at. Hilde jokingly in return asked if she was jealous. Cathrine kept 
silent. Hilde asked if she was still there then laughed a little. 
After a while, Cathrine lashed out. Hilde, shocked and confused tried 
to reason out with Cathrine but the brunette was too irritated and 
dwelling on the whole so-called situation they were in. She knew she 
was acting childish but she kept on pushing Hilde away. But the truth 
in fact is that she unconsciously needed Hilde to be with her to 
reassure her with a hug. They were only approaching their first 
monthsary when Hilde was called to be Relena&#39;s bodyguard. They were 
now approaching their third month. They only saw each other during 
Sundays and sometimes, when Hilde found her way to see Cathrine when 
she had the chance. 

Cathrine misses Hilde and the brunette was one possessive woman. 

Hilde, confused and tired, rolled her eyes and slammed the receiver 
and cursed. She sat on her bed and blinked. She sprang up again and 
cursed and dialed Cathrine&#39;s number. Trowa picked up and told her 
Cathrine went out, crying. Hilde cursed herself for being such a 
bitch. She shouldn&#39;t have hung up on her girlfriend like that. She 
just did it on instinct to avoid cursing openly with Cathrine hearing 
her. She was furious with the thought. Not because of Cathrine was 
jealous but because of the cause of her girlfriend&#39;s fear. She was 
angry with herself for being far from her and not being able to 
protect her instead. If only she could leave her job. but she also 
wanted to protect the one of the most important people of the world. 

Oh how she loved Cathrine to the core. 

&quot;There there now, shh.&quot; Hilde smoothed Cathrine&#39;s hair. 

They held each other just like that for several minutes. Only Cathrine 
broke the silence. 

&quot;Hmm. You must be disgusted with me right now for acting so childish 
even though I&#39;m two years older than you.&quot; 

&quot;Of course not! I&#39;ll never think such things! And besides, you&#39;ll 
never look old.&quot; Hilde grinned. 

Cathrine giggled as well. Hilde always knew how to cheer her up. Hilde 
took care of her very well even though her girlfriend&#39;s younger than 
Cathrine. As a performer, she knew how it felt to receive praises and 
compliments but she never appreciated any of them the way she 
cherished that came from Hilde. 

&quot;I&#39;m still wondering how you came here you know.&quot; 

&quot;I ran.&quot; 

&quot;You ran?!&quot; Hilde repeated, shocked. The circus is three kilometers 
from here. 

&quot;Hai. And I climbed up the wall. Kind of like you used to do, ne?&quot; 

Hilde blushed. Oh yeah, she used to do that when she sneaked inside 
the circus grounds back then. Ah, the good &#39;ol courtship days. 

&#39;She ran all three kilometers. owchie.&#39; Hilde winced. 

&quot;Is there something wrong?&quot; 

&quot;Uh, nothing.&quot; 

&quot;Still thinking I can beat you with running, ne?&quot; 

Hilde laughed. In her years of training, she hasn&#39;t seen someone so 
fast in running. 

&quot;But your legs hurt, ne? I&#39;m sure.&quot; 

Cathrine made a little cute pout and nodded. &quot;Mm-hmm.&quot; 

Hilde sighed and smiled. &quot;C&#39;mon,&quot; She lifted the slim girl with her 
wiry hands and deposited them both on the bed. The girl yipped and 
giggled. As soon as they were both settled on top of the bed, Hilde 
wrapped her arm around Cathrine and both melted as they looked into 
each other&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;I love you Hilde.&quot; Cathrine said with watery eyes. 

&quot;Hey, why are you crying?&quot; Hilde made a move to wipe away the tears 
but Cathrine batted her hands away. 

&quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; She waved. &quot;It&#39;s just that.&quot; She looked into Hilde&#39;s 
eyes. She bit her lip then moved closer. 

&quot;Cathy.&quot; Hilde moved closer and closed her eyes as her lips met 
Cathrine&#39;s. It was a soft kiss, Hilde felt Cathrine&#39;s arms encircle 
her. She opened her eyes and kissed Cathrine&#39;s nose.

&quot;I love you too, Cathy.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Cathrine sighed. &quot;y&#39;know, about the whole jealousy 
thing. I miss you and I&#39;m scared that I might lose you to someone 
obviously beautiful and rich and popular and-&quot; 

&quot;But I&#39;m still here, ne? I still think you&#39;re the most beautiful, sexy 
woman I have laid my eyes upon.&quot; Hilde softly smiled. &quot;And most of 
all, you&#39;re the one I love.&quot; 

Cathrine tore her teary eyes away, biting her lower lip. She felt so 
guilty with her behavior earlier that evening and now, she was hearing 
these so sweet, forgiving, loving and reassuring words from her lover. 
She felt so ashamed. All her life, all of the people around her 
believed she could stand on her own feet, even though she was the 
youngest among the circus crew. She only trusted herself. She was the 
youngest and yet she thought like most of the adults did. 

Then came Hilde. The woman was witty and fun to be with. Ever since 
Hilde laid eyes upon Cathrine at a circus act months ago, she was 
determined to know the girl&#39;s name and know her more. Then the two 
women fell in love with each other. Hilde visited Cathrine almost 
every night to see her and whenever she fails to visit the girl, 
Cathrine would always see a bouquet of roses in her trailer with a 
card. Hilde&#39;s one sweet woman and it&#39;s no mystery why Cathrine fell 
easily with the shorthaired woman. 

With Hilde, Cathrine learned to experience childhood once more. But 
that isn&#39;t all. Hilde let her feel that is was okay to let loose. She 
let her open her eyes that there is time and space for everything if 
she only learned to open her heart. With Hilde, she learned how to 
trust. 

Well, she *is* learning right now which explains her discrepancy. 

&quot;Ne, Cat, let&#39;s stop all of this guilt trip thing.&quot; Hilde kissed her 
eyes. &quot;Say, you must be hungry or something. You want me to get you 
anything?&quot; 

Shaking her head, Cathrine tightened her embrace around the other girl 
as Hilde relaxed in her embrace by moving closer to the curly-haired 
girl. They remained in that position for several minutes. Feeling the 
security in each other&#39;s embrace. 

&quot;Trowa might be wondering where you went, y&#39;know.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m perfectly safe right here so no need to worry.&quot; 

Hilde laughed. &quot;Are you sure about that?&quot; 

Cathrine looked at her laughing girlfriend. &quot;Yes. Why shouldn&#39;t I be?&quot; 

&quot;Am I safe?&quot; Hilde teased. 

Cathrine raised an eloquent eyebrow. &quot;Hey, the question should be 
other way around, you know.&quot; 

&quot;Huh?&quot; Hilde blushed as her girlfriend laughed and aimed her a 
seductive smile. Even though Cathrine acted like she was younger 
whenever they were together, Hilde wasn&#39;t sure with Cathrine&#39;s 
experiences. She must not ignore the fact that 

Cathrine is still two years older and of course she knew things but. 

&quot;Ne, Hilde-chan, do you think I&#39;m beautiful?&quot; Cathrine breathed, her 
face inching closer. 

&quot;Hai.&quot; 

&quot;Do you think I&#39;m cuter than that Peacecraft-sama woman?&quot; Cathrine 
whispered, eyes piercing Hilde&#39;s. 

&quot;Of course. Definitely!&quot; Hilde was sweating like hell. 

&quot;Do you find me really sexy?&quot; Cathrine whispered huskily, biting her 
lower lip. 

Hilde gulped. &quot;Yes. And I love you, Cathy.&quot; 

&quot;And I love you too.&quot; Cathrine said as she brought her lips to Hilde. 
Such a soft. sweet kiss. plush lips brushing over each other in a 
graceful movement. 

Arms encircled each other&#39;s bodies, occasionally sliding each other&#39;s 
backs or touching each other&#39;s face. The kiss became more heightened 
in pace, letting each other&#39;s lips mesh with each other. Both pairs of 
hands finding way across each other&#39;s bodies. 

Breaking from their kiss, both women panted hard. and looked into each 
other&#39;s eyes. Oh how they needed each other. 

Cathrine pulled Hilde into another kiss and as Hilde indulged, she 
settled on top of her and gripped on Cathrine&#39;s shoulders. 

Feeling fingers digging into her scalp Hilde was too lost into the 
kiss. the kiss that was deepened that both women reveled into 
exploring each other&#39;s mouths and tickling each other&#39;s tongues. 

Settling herself into a proper, if not comfortable, position, Hilde 
tried spreading her legs apart so that Cathrine&#39;s legs are in between. 
But she didn&#39;t remain that way for even thirty seconds because it was 
straining her legs too much. Cathrine giggled. Hilde blushed at that 
embarrassing interruption so she settled one leg in between Cathrine&#39;s 
legs and one leg at the left side of Cathrine&#39;s left leg. 

Both women resumed kissing and not after for so long, Hilde was quite 
surprised but didn&#39;t break away from the kiss when she felt Cathrine 
tugging off her shirt. Not having the shirt completely removed she 
then felt Cathrine&#39;s hand invading her top. She felt two hands travel 
up and down her spine which made her shiver. This made her react 
instinctively thus kissing Cathrine harder. Not having contented with 
kissing the brunette, she began trailing kisses on her neck, gently 
nipping on the porcelain skin.

Partly tickled and partly aroused by the touch and sensation, Cathrine 
emitted a giggle and a moan, which increased Hilde&#39;s lust. She tugged 
on Cathrine&#39;s shirt impatiently. 

&quot;How do you get this thing off?&quot; Hilde whispered, irritated at the 
body hugging sleeveless T-shirt. 

Cathrine giggled and kissed the wrinkled meeting eyebrows and pushed 
Hilde up as she aimed her a seductive smile and removed her shirt 
exposing smooth skin that almost sent Hilde over the edge. 

&quot;So. where were we?&quot; Cathrine whispered as she pulled Hilde back into 
their previous position. 

Hilde snorted. Cathrine closed her eyes as Hilde&#39;s lips descended on 
her neck and resumed its earlier nipping and sucking. 

&quot;Mmm.&quot; Cathrine sighed in pleasure as her own hands continued their 
earlier wanderings. 

Hilde licked Cathrine&#39;s chest, feeling the silky skin with her tongue. 
She could feel Cathrine&#39;s hands brushing over her back. then she felt 
her bra&#39;s clasp from behind click. Hands slid to remove the garment. 

Her own hands automatically responded by unclasping Cathrine&#39;s own 
strapless bra with the clasp in front. Just as when she was trying to 
appreciate the sight before her, she was deliciously distracted by two 
hands feeling the vicinity where her bra was before. below her armpits 
and then rested on her breast in feather-light touch. 

Cathrine began massaging Hilde&#39;s breasts gently. 

Hilde gasped between breaths as she continued licking and kissing 
Cathrine. The touch made her reacting immensely, involuntarily sliding 
her left thigh in between Cathrine&#39;s thighs. 

This reaction elicited a squealing moan from Cathrine, deep in lust 
and pleasure. Hilde smirked. So she continued sliding her thigh 
against Cathrine&#39;s inner thighs. 

But Hilde wasn&#39;t satisfied with her little mischief. 

She licked Cathrine&#39;s right nipple. 

&quot;Uhh-huh.&quot; Cathrine squeaked and bit her lip. 

Hilde completely aroused with the noises Cathrine was making, enclosed 
her mouth on one breast and sucked. 

&quot;Uhuh!!! Mmph!!!&quot; Cathrine almost cried out as her body instantly 
reacted to the sensual touch, arching her back to the touch and her 
legs raising. which accidentally slid and bumped into Hilde&#39;s inner 
thighs. 

Hilde gasped. Cathrine then realized the caress Hilde has been doing 
to her and saw the reaction it brought to her partner. She then 
pressed her knee in between Hilde&#39;s thighs and clit. 

With a sounding pop, Hilde left Cathrine&#39;s right breast and started 
licking on the other breast. Both of her hands slid down to her 
thighs, gently massaging the tensed muscles. 

Both women moaned in pleasure and sweet pain. Both felt the heat 
emanating from each other&#39;s between. 

Furiously, Cathrine started tugging on Hilde&#39;s bottom pajamas. The 
girl was about to sleep when Cathrine entered her room through the 
window. How on earth did Cathrine sneaked into Relena&#39;s mansion 
grounds was beyond Hilde. Cathrine was in her customary tight fitting 
outfit and so very short shorts. 

Hilde snickered. &quot;Impatience will ruin the mood, koi.&quot; Not necessarily 
moving from her position, she slid off the half slid-off bottoms and 
kissed Cathrine fully on the lips. 

&quot;Mmm. will this ruin the mood?&quot; Cathrine whispered, as her hand 
caressed Hilde&#39;s already soaked panties. Hilde gasped. 

&quot;Aha! Mmphh.&quot; Hilde moaned, struggling her balance and feeling the 
touch of Cathrine&#39;s hand rubbing her. down there. 

Cathrine smirked. She lifted one finger and brushed through the satin 
panties. 

Feeling fireworks in her head, Hilde hiccuped and breathed through her 
mouth. 

Cathrine retrieved her hand, leaving Hilde&#39;s between feeling 
abandoned. 

&quot;Heeeey!!!&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t hey me, koi. Finish what you started.&quot; 

Hilde pouted and mock died beside Cathrine, lying her head on top of 
her koi&#39;s shoulder. &quot;No fair.&quot; 

But then, Cathrine would always get what she wanted. 

&quot;But koi, don&#39;t you want me?&quot; Cathrine had that cute pout on her face 
that Hilde couldn&#39;t resist. 

&quot;Of course I do!&quot; 

&quot;I bet you like Relena better than me.&quot; Cathrine was quickly cut off 
when she saw Hilde top her immediately with a serious expression on 
her face. 

&quot;Are we going back to this whole jealousy thing? Do you still believe 
that I&#39;d prefer Relena than YOU?&quot; 

Cathrine had a nervous look on her face and had trouble replacing it 
with a smile, which was obviously wavering with utter nervousness. 
&quot;Iie, Hilde. I was just joking.&quot; With that, she tried to cover herself 
with the crumpled sheets pooling around them and got up, as she felt 
the insecurity got the best of her but was unsuccessful as Hilde 
pushed her back down. Hilde was kind of shorter but tougher than the 
two. She tried to compose herself as she was taken aback by the 
serious look on Hilde&#39;s face. 

&quot;Well, I&#39;m not. Cathrine, I love you. So far, I don&#39;t know what sexual 
experiences you had before now so I might as well tell you now that 
I&#39;m a beginner and would want to make our first time special. It would 
hurt me to know that you believe that I prefer someone else in bed 
with me right now while making love to you.&quot; 

Now that was brutally frank. 

Cathrine was silent, refusing to meet Hilde&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;And I want you. God, you just don&#39;t know how much I do crave for you. 
Yes, you&#39;re the most beautiful being I have set eyes upon. The 
goddesses are envious, I can tell. You&#39;re better than Relena because 
for one, I LOVE you and two. you&#39;re definitely good-looking. And YES, 
you&#39;re so sexy you melt the elastic in my underwear even when I&#39;m just 
asleep and dreaming of your gorgeous body.&quot; 

Cathrine giggled and sniffed and tried to blink back tears. &quot;Gomen, 
ne.&quot; She whispered. 

&quot;Huh?&quot; 

&quot;I just. I just don&#39;t want to wake up in the morning to find you 
gone.&quot; She began racking with sobs again. &quot;You might be taking my 
breath away by telling me how beautiful I am. then, I&#39;d find myself in 
the morning looking wasted and alone in a cold, empty bed.&quot; 

&quot;Shh.&quot; Hilde caressed Cathrine&#39;s cheek and one arm snaked around her 
waist. 

&quot;Ne, Hilde, don&#39;t leave me?&quot; 

Hilde sighed. &quot;I won&#39;t, Cathrine, I promise. Trust me.&quot; 

&quot;I trust you. Hold me tonight?&quot; Cathrine pleaded. 

&quot;Hai.&quot; 

Two women kissed. both lost in each other&#39;s tight embrace. Tongues 
warring over, lips slick with saliva. Sucking each other&#39;s essence. 
they couldn&#39;t have enough of each other. This desperate need they have 
for each other could not be contained in both hands. 

Trust. I need to be here. hold me. stop the nightmares. relieve me 
from my pain. I don&#39;t want to be hurt. take away the pain. I don&#39;t 
want to be alone. 

I need you. 

Cathrine cupped Hilde&#39;s face in her hands as they kissed as Hilde&#39;s 
hands roamed all over Cathrine&#39;s body. Legs in constant movement. 
entwined and occasionally brushing and bumping each other&#39;s between. 
Soft moans only heightened each other&#39;s lust, which only made kissing 
more fervent. Their passion-filled moment has come to break the 
barriers of the level of their relationship. 

It is now time for them to cross that boundary. 

Gasping for breath, Cathrine&#39;s eyes rolled back into their lids as 
Hilde licked her body. blowed hot breaths all over her. downwards. 
strong, smooth hands kneading her muscles. almost a desperate caress. 

Short breaths and shaking bodies. two souls in need. desperate for 
each other&#39;s presence. hands gripping at the sheets. wetting them with 
hot sweat. 

Moans escaped her thin lips as she felt Hilde&#39;s hand fondled with her 
pussy. it felt hot, it felt wet. it was driving her completely 
lustful. Her hips were rocking in synch with Hilde&#39;s rubbing. 

&quot;Hilde-chan. uhnn. aha! Feels so good. don&#39;t stop.&quot; 

She let out a desperate cry when the pleasurable rubbing left her. Her 
legs were wiggling in lust but Hilde pushed them downwards. She bit 
her lip when she felt cool air brush over her as Hilde slid off her 
t-back satin panties. 

As silent apology for the earlier abandoning, Hilde kissed her koi on 
the lips, distracting her for what was about to come. She felt her 
lover squirm under her as she slowly rubbed her pussy again. She could 
feel the hot throbbing flesh against her fingers. desperate for 
attention and satisfaction only she could give. 

&quot;Ooohhh. mmmmph. aha!! Oh uh!! Mmmph.&quot; 

Hilde, almost non-caring in her motions, dispatched her already 
soaking panties as she continued exploring Cathrine&#39;s body. 

Cathrine eyes went wide and her heart began to beat thrice as fast as 
she felt Hilde&#39;s knees separating her thighs apart. Licking tongues 
making slapping noises as both desperately licked and kissed each 
other. Cathrine tightened her hold on Hilde&#39;s hand. 

&quot;Hilde.&quot; Cathrine murmured. This felt so good. so right. 

Hilde went down on Cathrine, still not letting go on her hold of her 
hand. Her other hand slid over her love&#39;s thighs. Cathrine gasped. Two 
fingers spread her two throbbing clits apart. 

&quot;Mmmph. Hilde. onegai.&quot; 

Hilde licked the plump flesh. She could feel the heat emanating from 
Cathrine in her tongue. Oh God, she&#39;s so perfect. She&#39;s so beautiful. 
Her scent was intoxicating I can feel myself drowning. I&#39;m so high. I 
don&#39;t wanna get out of this anymore. 

Cathrine on the other hand was thrashing her head, delirious in the 
delicious touch and abuse. She couldn&#39;t think. she couldn&#39;t 
concentrate. All she could do was whimper in torturing pleasure. She&#39;s 
giving it all to her love. She trusted Hilde. that she is certain. 

The tongue invading Cathrine was pushing itself into her. almost 
wanting to go further inside. Cathrine&#39;s hips were bucking up towards 
the licking tongue, wanting more contact. Whimpering, Cathrine closed 
her eyes as she reveled the sensation of 

Hilde&#39;s tongue sliding in between her folds, sliding along the pink 
flesh, wet with the mixture of her juice and Hilde&#39;s saliva. 

The curly-haired woman almost shrieked in pure ecstasy as she felt 
Hilde&#39;s mouth fully enclosed over her pussy and sucked. Hard. Hot 
breaths blowing over her middle was driving her crazy. Her fingers dug 
into Hilde&#39;s scalp and cried out her lover&#39;s name. Her hips rose 
higher, begging more of the incredible sensation and abuse it was 
taking. 

&quot;Hi..Hil..Hilde.oooh!! Hilde! Oh God! Ummph!&quot; 

Hilde pushed her tongue out and pushed at Cathrine&#39;s grape-sized clit 
as she continuously sucked on it. The other girl&#39;s moans are 
deliriously arousing, she could feel her juices stream down her 
thighs. She could feel herself come as well soon. 

Sparks of light. it&#39;s like surrendering to the onrush of a waterfall. 

It didn&#39;t register right away as Hilde realized Cathrine had come at 
the same time she did. Her love screamed as fireworks exploded and 
flooded her vision. Her mind was blurry and white dots were floating. 
Both women were high from the release. 

Feeling her whole limp body shuddering from the earlier release, Hilde 
mustered all her energy left and crawled up to lie beside her beloved. 
Cathrine was still breathing hard eyes closed. her hair scattered all 
over her lovely sweat-slicked face. 

&#39;She&#39;s so beautiful.&#39; Hilde thought as she finger-brushed away the 
hair covering Cathrine&#39;s face. 

Slowly, purple eyes opened and focused on the woman in view. Cathrine 
smiled. 

&quot;That was. incredible.&quot; 

Hilde smiled back. &quot;Yes it was. YOU are incredible.&quot; 

After moments of slience, Cathrine asked cautiously, &quot;Would you be 
here tomorrow?&quot; 

&quot;Of course. We&#39;re not going to see the sun for 48 hours.&quot; 

Cathrine&#39;s face lit up with tears in her eyes. &quot;Really? You&#39;ll stay 
with me?&quot; 

&quot;Iie. We&#39;ll stay together.&quot; 

&quot;Promise?&quot; 

&quot;Promise.&quot; Hilde promised. 

Cathrine sighed in contentment. &quot;We should really take the bus when we 
go back to the trailer, ne?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah. love you, Cathy.&quot; Cupping Cathrine&#39;s cheek, Hilde kissed 
Cathrine on the lips. 

&quot;Mmm. I love you too, Hilde.&quot; Cathrine kissed back and snuggled in 
Hilde&#39;s protective embrace as both women were both welcomed by 
slumber&#39;s welcoming arms. 

And forever shall they be in each other&#39;s arms. in love. and in faith.
