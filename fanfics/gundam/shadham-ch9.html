Hilde sighed softly, pacing the dark office hallway impatiently. She had
come down to try and surprise Releena, but a major crimp had appeared in
her carefully thought out plans: it appeared Releena was trapped in the
meeting from hell.

According to Lady Une&#39;s secretary, she, Releena and some other pro-
Preventer cabinet members and politicians, as well as most of the
Preventers&#39; brass were behind closed doors with one of their greatest
opponents: the government accountants. Hilde almost felt sorry for
Releena as it was likely that she and Une were being forced to justify
every expenditure for the past year, down to the nuts and bolts if
needed.

&quot;Looks like you&#39;re here waiting as well, Hilde,&quot; a familiar, and quite
amused sounding, voice said from behind her. She turned to see Dorothy
Catalonia standing behind her, a pleasant smile on her face. &quot;Would you
like some tea while we wait?&quot; she invited.

Hilde chuckled softly, &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot; She followed Dorothy to two plush
chairs, the tea already set up for two. She raised her eyebrow at
Dorothy inquiringly.

&quot;One of the guards saw you pacing,&quot; Dorothy explained. She poured the
tea neatly, then sat down across from Hilde. She smiled wickedly, &quot;How&#39;s
married life been for you?&quot;

&quot;No complaints,&quot; Hilde said with a contented smile. &quot;Are you and Une
planning to settle down any time soon?&quot; she asked in return.

Dorothy took a small drink of her tea. &quot;I suppose it will have to depend
on how the adoption arrangements go,&quot; Dorothy answered her calmly.

&quot;Adoption?&quot; Hilde echoed, sounding more than a bit confused.

&quot;Well, we couldn&#39;t just leave Mariemea with the Barton family, could we?
Une was already making the arrangements when I entered the picture, and
I support her completely,&quot; Dorothy said with a little smile. She looked
up from her tea to see Hilde&#39;s reaction.

Hilde gaped at her, almost like her brain had derailed at the thought
of Dorothy and Une raising a young girl together. She shook her head,
&quot;I hope you know what you&#39;re getting into. I spent a few days with her
after she&#146;d finished her rehabilitation and finally got out of her
wheelchair while I was getting ready the be assigned as Releena&#146;s
bodyguard, and she&#39;s one of the most... intense children I&#39;ve ever met.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Dorothy said with a fond smile, &quot;that&#39;s one of the things I
most like about her.&quot; Hilde laughed softly, and they settled down to
some serious tea drinking.

A young woman in a Preventers&#39; uniform jogged up to where they were
sitting, and then saluted Hilde. She gave her report as if it was a
military debriefing. &quot;They&#39;ll be out of the meeting in another half
hour,&quot; she repeated calmly, &quot;even if they have to shoot their way out.
That&#39;s a direct quote from Commander Une, by the way.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hilde said with a sigh and a smirk. The girl jogged off,
and Hilde turned to Dorothy with a shrug. &quot;Only half an hour left.&quot;

Dorothy looked at Hilde thoughtfully, &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to ask you
this: what in the world did you see in Duo Maxwell, anyway?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t pull any punches, do you?&quot; Hilde said with a nervous little
laugh. &quot;Well, part of it was a sort of mothering thing. What can I say?
Duo Maxwell is just a big kid at heart. I saw it as my chance to be a
&#145;big sister&#146; in a sense.&quot; She sighed softly, &quot;And part of it was...
well...&quot; She blushed, &quot;I&#39;m a bit ashamed to admit it.&quot;

Dorothy grinned as she quickly bargained, &quot;Tell you what. I&#39;ll tell you
why I had a crush on Releena, all 4 1/2 years ago, if you&#39;ll tell me
the rest.&quot;

Still blushing, Hilde shyly admitted, &quot;I think it was also because he
completely unimpressed by me.&quot; She pretended to look very surprised,
&quot;He&#39;s ignoring me?&quot; then a bit indignant, &quot;How dare he?&quot; then finally
an exaggerated, seductive pose, &quot;I&#39;ll make him notice me!&quot; To the quiet
sound of Dorothy&#39;s laughter she sheepishly explained &quot;I don&#146;t regret
what I had with Duo, it was a lot of fun. Sooner or later, however, you
have to grow up. He didn&#146;t, at least not when we were together. I guess
I got so caught up in the thrill of the hunt I don&#39;t think I really
noticed the faults of the prize.&quot;

Dorothy sipped a bit of tea before finally keeping her end of the
bargain. &quot;When I first met Releena-chan in the Sank Kingdom, she was
dressing in that ridiculous school teacher outfit, surrounded by her
students, and all I could think was, &#39;She&#39;s so beautiful.&#39; Of course,
that was before I even talked to her,&quot; she explained with a smile.
&quot;Once I started debating her, my crush got worse.&quot; She smiled up at
Hilde; &quot;There&#39;s so few people who can actually keep up with me, Releena.
Thankfully Lady Une is one, Mariemea, one or two others, and her. I
loved sparing with her, crossing swords with our minds over the merits
of war and peace.&quot;

&quot;Plus, she is such a babe,&quot; Dorothy said offhandedly, toasting her with
her teacup.

Hilde, laughing softly, could only agree.

&quot;Free at last, free at last, thank god almighty we&#39;re free at last,&quot;
they heard a pair of quite happy women&#39;s voices chanted together,
growing closer by the second. Hilde turned to see Releena and Une
jogging down the hallway towards them.

Une gently pulled Dorothy out of her chair and into her arms, surprising
the blonde Duchess with a vigorous kiss. &quot;You have no idea how good it
is to see you,&quot; Une sighed.

&quot;Gee, I should trap you in budget meetings more often,&quot; a broadly
smiling Dorothy said with a breathless little laugh.

Une winced, &quot;Don&#39;t even joke about that, please.&quot;

Releena laughed softly, Hilde getting from her seat at the sight of
her, &quot;That goes double for me.&quot; She pulled Hilde into a slower, more
thorough kiss until the wolf whistles from nearby Preventer officers
caused them to separate.

&quot;Don&#39;t you have something better to do?&quot; Une asked the revelers,
sounding fairly severe but still smiling slightly. Once they were more
alone she turned to the other three, &quot;Let&#146;s get out of here before the
accountants decide they missed something.&quot;

Releena all but shuddered at the idea of dealing with the accountants
any more today, &quot;Very good idea. Let&#39;s go!&quot;

Une slid an arm around Dorothy&#39;s shoulders as they walked out into the
sunlight. Hilde and Releena followed a bit more slowly, watching their
friends walking together. &quot;They do make a lovely couple,&quot; Releena said
softly.

Hilde gently took Releena&#39;s hand, smiling down at her. &quot;Yes, they do.
But not so lovely as you,&quot; Hilde answered her softly.

&quot;You know just what to say,&quot; Releena smiled, squeezing Hilde&#39;s hand
slightly.

Hilde smiled down at Releena, &quot;What say we go home, skip dinner, and go
to bed early?&quot;

Releena grinned back at Hilde, &quot;Promises, promises.&quot;



Une smiled her arm around Dorothy as they all walked away from the
Preventers&#39; building together. Treise&#39;s dream of a peaceful world still
hadn&#39;t come about, but they were getting closer to it everyday. Absolute
pacifism, she had realized, wasn&#39;t the answer. Only hard work from
people with the courage to make the world a better place could
accomplish that dream.

Une looked at her lover and her friends, and felt certain that it would
be done, someday.

Author&#146;s Notes:

First off, I cannot give enough thanks to Shanejayell, the author of the
story &quot;True Protector,&quot; on which this story is based. You can find the
original at: http://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=750223 and at:
http://www.shoujoai.com/fanfics/gundam/truprot/ . Per Shane&#146;s request,
I&#146;m going to point out the differences between the two, chapter by
chapter. However, so much of this story is Shane&#146;s work that I&#146;ve
decided to just point out the changes I&#146;ve made to the original. They
are as follows: 

Ch.1-Adding Paragraphs 1-4, changing Noin to Hilde

Ch.2-Paragraph 2, changing Wu-Fei to Trowa, Noin to Hilde, Hilde to
Catherine, adding Duo and his dialog, adding the last paragraph

Ch.3-Noin to Hilde, Paragraph 8 changes

Ch.4-Noin to Hilde, &#145;Dotty-chan&#146; and Releena&#146;s relationship, Paragraph
26-27

Ch.5-Dorothy and Releena&#146;s relationship, Releena and Hilde&#146;s declaration
of each other&#146;s bisexuality, Noin to Hilde, Black silk PJs, 

Ch.6-Tallgesse references, Noin to Hilde, last two Paragraph mods

Ch.7-Noin to Hilde, Hilde to Wu-Fei, Paragraph 6 changes, Using the
Tallgesse Mk. III to fight in, Wu-Fei to Trowa, changes to 35, 37, 41,
42, 45, 46, and 48

Ch.8-Paragraph 3, Paragraph 9 changes, Howard to Quatre, Paragraph 11
changes, 

Ch.9-Releena to Hilde, Chapter 10 changes, Chapter 14-17 changes.

These are in addition to other changes too numerous to mention. To find
If you&#146;re reading this Shane, again, thank you. 

Second, some people ask, &quot;Why a Hilde/Releena story?&quot; Very simple: 

Regarding Hilde, I always thought she was of the most potentially
interesting characters of the story. Who was this petite, brave young
warrior woman really? What kind of person was she? We get a glimpse of
this in the series, but I always thought there was a great deal more
than met the eye. 

As for Releena, when you watch enough anime, you get an idea of a
character&#146;s true nature, and in some cases, their &quot;preferences&quot; by
looking at certain clues. In the case of the former
&quot;Queen of the World,&quot; it includes: 

-Her being a strong, self-assured young woman, (in spite of all her
pining away for Heero). 

-She has a quiet, yet take charge demeanor. 

-Except for the white mini-skirt in the beginning of the series, she
has an affinity for slacks and somewhat boyish looking outfits when she
has a choice of what outfit she wants to wear.  

I know, I know, these factors don&#146;t necessarily make a woman/girl and
lesbian or bisexual. However, again, when you watch enough anime,
certain things can&#146;t help but perk up one&#146;s ears. 

As for the whole Dorothy/Releena thing, to me, she just seemed too
devoted to Releena. Why? The story above is my explanation for this. I
hope I am not to far off.  

Thank you for your time and understanding.
