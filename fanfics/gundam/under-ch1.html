<pre>The two kois laughed as they skated along the boardwalk.

&quot;Slow down Hilde!&quot;Relena giggled, holding her lover&#39;s hand tightly, 
trying not to be left behind by the speeding German. 

&quot;No way Relena!&quot;Hilde yelled, speeding up.

&quot;Where are we going?!&quot;Relena screamed back, almost hitting a 
pedestrian. The man cursed, but the two were too far ahead of him to 
hear it. 

&quot;You&#39;ll see!&quot;

It was an unbearably hot day, it had reached 110 degrees, and was 
still climbing. The two girls were clad in bikini tops and short 
shorts. Relena&#39;s hair was up in a ponytail, and looked like a flag 
trailing behind her as they skated down the wooden paneling.

It was their one year anniversary, and Hilde had took it upon herself 
to find a crazy place to spend it. 

********************

&quot;Devil bat to zero angel, come in zero angel.&quot;

&quot;Duo. Heero. Not zero angel, just Heero.&quot;

&quot;Roger that zero angel.&quot; 

Heero rolled his eyes. He then spotted the pair on rollerskates 
speeding through the crowd.

&quot;I see them.&quot;

&quot;Roger that zero angel, where are they?&quot;

&quot;Infront of the hotdog stand.&quot;

&quot;Mission sighted. Let&#39;s take operation seperate into action. This is 
devil bat over and out.&quot;

**********************

Hilde flipped open the trap door and smiled mischievously. Relena 
raised an eyebrow, but didn&#39;t have time to ask as Hilde pulled her 
into the compartment.

Oh when the sun beats down and burns the tar up on the roof.
And your shoes get so hot, you wish your tired feet were fire-proof.
Under the Boardwalk, down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby, is where I&#39;ll be. 

&quot;Where did they go?&quot;Duo asked Heero as they searched the boardwalk for 
the couple.

&quot;Hn.&quot;

&quot;Whatever.&quot;

************************

Relena sat down the backpack she had, and opened it, pulling out two 
sodas, chips, cookies, and other assorted goodies. 

Hilde set down the two hotdogs, and pulled Relena down onto her lap. 
Both girls laughed, and lightly kissed. It was a kawaii seen that 
would give you a toothache to see.

Relena picked up a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich and took it out 
of the plastic bag. She ripped off a piece and fed it to Hilde. They 
both giggled and snuggled some more, and then Hilde fed Relena a piece 
of a roast beef sandwhich. The two sighed in contentment, loving just 
being together, oblivious to the two men looking for them.

(Under the Boardwalk) 
Out of the sun.
(Under the Boardwalk) 
Man, we&#39;ll be having some fun.
(Under the Boardwalk) 
People walkin&#39; above.
(Under the Boardwalk) 
We&#39;ll be falling in love under the Boardwalk
Boardwalk. 

They could hear the waves crashing beyond the wooden paneling, and 
Hilde smiled. She reached over and pushed a board, making a few off 
them fall down so they could see the beach and the cerulean waves 
crashing against it. 

&quot;Oh Hilde!&quot;Relena cried and crushed their lips together with such 
force they both fell over. Both of them giggled, before kissing again, 
not pulling away this time.

From the palms you hear the happy sounds of the carousel,
and you can almost taste the hot-dogs and french fries they sell.
Under the Boardwalk, down by the sea
on a blanket with my baby, is where I&#39;ll be .

&quot;Zero angel, come in zero angel!&quot;Duo said to his

walkee-talkee, hearing the giggling below them.

&quot;Duo I&#39;m right here,&quot;Heero muttered, crossing his arms,&quot;What?&quot;

Duo pointed below them, and soon Heero heard it too. Giggling. He 
smirked.

&quot;Let&#39;s put phase one into action.&quot;

*********************************

The two girls were now lying across the checkered blanket, their arms 
around each other. They were closing in for another kiss when a person 
fell in through the trap door. The two jumped and blinked in surprise.

A woman with brown hair that reached past her waiste in two pig tailed 
braids quickly sat up, brushing off her shorts and mutturing 
something. When she noticed the two girls, she blushed.

&quot;Oh my God!!! Are you two....GAY?!&quot; the girl squeeled, backing away. 
Hilde and Relena looked at each other, before smiling and nodding.

&#39;Damn it! Why couldn&#39;t they be embarrassed?&#39;Duo cursed, before trying 
another one.

&quot;AREN&#39;T YOU RELENA PEACECRAFT?! RELENA PEACECRAFT IS GAY?!?!?!?!&quot; Duo 
yelled, and Relena blushed.

&quot;Yes, yes I am,&quot; she said, smiling at Hilde. Duo rolled his eyes, 
trying to think of another good one.

&quot;Um, not to be rude, but we&#39;d like to be alone,&quot;Hilde said, trying to 
keep from sounding to impatient. Duo glared at her, but forced a 
giggle.

&quot;Okay! Bye then!&quot;he squeeled, and ran up the stairs and out the door. 
Hilde and Relena burst out laughing.

&quot;D-did *burst of laughter* y-you see*giggle* D-duo&#39;s f-face? Oh my God 
ha ha ha ha ha ha,&quot;Hilde laughed, and Relena was turning blue in the 
face from laughing so hard. She then put on an emotionless face and 
deadpanned, &quot;Mission failed.&quot;

The two laughed harder, as the two above growled in frustration.

&quot;I DRESSED UP LIKE A GIRL AND THIS HAPPENS?!&quot;Duo yelled, and then 
noticed all the men looking at him. He sweatdropped and hid behind 
Heero.

(Under the Boardwalk) 
Out of the sun.
(Under the Boardwalk) 
Man, we&#39;ll be having some fun.
(Under the Boardwalk) 
People walkin&#39; above.
(Under the Boardwalk) 
We&#39;ll be falling in love under the Boardwalk, 

Boardwalk.

Relena and Hilde fell asleep in each other&#39;s arms. They had twin 
smiles on their faces. 

Heero and Duo were plotting other ways to seperate them.

&quot;We could scare them out.&quot;

&quot;With what? Pelicans?&quot;Hero snorted, glaring at his partner. Duo 
winced, but managed a steady glare as a reply.

Under the Boardwalk, down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby, is where I&#39;ll be. 

***************************

That night, Relena awoke. She used the Feris Wheel lights to focus on 
her koi. God she loved her.

Relena gingerly pushed the bangs from the German girl&#39;s face, and 
smiled with love sparkling in her eyes. 

Hilde woke up soon after, and smiled back at Relena.

&quot;Love you,&quot;the girl said, stretching.

&quot;Ditto,&quot;the blonde replied, and they snuggled some more.

&quot;We have to come back here,&quot;Relena muttured, resting her chin on 
Hilde&#39;s head. 

&quot;Oh but next year you pick the spot,&quot;Hilde whispered. Relena smiled 
evilly. Hilde caught the look, and asked her,&quot;Oh God what?&quot;

&quot;Nothing, nothing,&quot;Relena lied, as she plotted the fun of staying in 
one of the G-boy&#39;s safehouses. Next year would bevery fun.

As the sandy blonde and midnight blue haired girl cuddled, two pilots 
were still stuck plotting.

&quot;I got it, run down there and threaten to kill her, she&#39;ll fall for 
you!&quot;

&quot;Yeah right Duo.&quot;

&quot;Oh come one!&quot;

Under the Boardwalk, down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby, is where I&#39;ll be.
