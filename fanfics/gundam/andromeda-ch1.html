<h1>The Constellation Andromeda</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alithea.html">Alithea</a><br> </h2>
<pre>They had been dancing the entire night through. Meeting on the dance 
floor in a perfectly choreographed manner that did not seem possible 
for real life. It was like a dream sequence in a movie, or the ballet 
portion of a Rogers and Hemerstien musical, mythical and unreal. And 
both seemed, on a physical level, built for one another as precise 
moves took them from one dance to the next, waltz, salsa, tango&#133; 

The taller of the two, appropriately in the lead, some called her a 
severe woman, militaristic and cold, but those that knew her well 
understood that she was indeed a lady. The strictest sense of the word 
observed in her reserved hairstyle, light brown hair tightly slicked 
into a uniform bun. The palest of rose pink lipstick noticeable on her 
only when she grinned and hazelnut colored eyes calmly reaching from 
behind circular framed glasses.  The lady dipped her partner, as the 
melody died away, her lips lingering painfully close to the shorter 
woman&#39;s neck. Touching upon the pale skin briefly as, slowly, she 
helped the young woman stand.

Not a word had been uttered since they found each other. Just the 
dance, the movements and music doing all the speaking that needed to 
be done. A spark of heat burning across and through both as they 
caught their breaths and stared into each other&#39;s eyes. And the band 
played what most in the dance hall understood was to be the last song 
of the evening, as the two women pulled together, bodies leading the 
way, marking the steps. 

The shorter of the two looked dizzy, as if all the dancing, all the 
unspoken thoughts were too much a surprise for her. No one had ever 
read her so well before. And while the lady was an almost stoic form, 
the shorter woman was nimble, the figure of a professional dancer. Her 
heart ready to leap from her chest whenever her violet-gray eyes 
stared too deeply into the brown before her. Passion, lust&#133; it echoed 
back between the two when they moved. Bolder as the night wore on 
because the young woman trusted the lady to lead her safely, let a 
near graceful hand sweep through her ruddy brown hair.

Applause in the distance was the death knell for the evening. Praise 
for the band flittering around the two women who could, at that 
moment, only see each other. The crowd around them was thinning, 
background voices making plans to go to a restaurant, or mutterings of 
good-byes and the young woman was sure those she had come with would 
be looking for her but&#133; despite her cautionary nature regarding 
romantic interludes she could not&#133; No, she would not deny herself what 
the lady was promising. Forever or one night it didn&#39;t matter as she 
silently accepted the invitation. The two walked out of the dance hall 
together pausing briefly for their lips to meet, tasting the words 
their voices could not supply. 

And where are we fading to 
Are we but softness and light 
Are we but flashes in the air 
Where are we going to 
Will you remember this 
Will you forget 
If I lose you tomorrow 
Will you beg for today 
And are we 
Images and nothing 
Shadows and dust 
Tell me 
Where are we fading to 
Where are we going

His jaw had been locked and clenched the entire evening, dark eyes 
watching the two women with a spark of furry in his eyes. There were 
those he wanted to blame. Those he wanted to accuse of ruining his 
plans, and they ran hotter when he heard the chuckle behind him. He 
spun around to met with stormy blue eyes and a delectable smirk.

&quot;Honestly Nichol, you look like a little boy ready to have temper 
tantrum&quot;, the woman breezed.

&quot;Tell me this wasn&#39;t your doing?&quot; 

She arched an eyebrow and then peered over his shoulder catching the 
quick exchange between the two women who had owned the dance floor the 
whole of the evening. Then she brought her gaze back to the young man 
before her and sighed patiently. The parking lot was still crowded 
with people making plans, night air warm, and stars invisible. 

&quot;Why would you think I had anything to do with it?&quot;

&quot;Dorothy, I mean it.&quot;

&quot;Do tell me, what was a worse blow to your ego tonight&#133;losing the lady 
or the chance to ruin Barton&#39;s stepsister?&quot; Her grin spread just a 
little more as he sneered. &quot;Can&#39;t have it all Nicholai.&quot; She pat him 
on the shoulder. &quot;Let&#39;s to dinner. I&#39;m starving.&quot;

He nodded and then asked because he was curious, &quot;So, you approve?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not for me to approve or disapprove, Nichol dear&#133; She&#39;s mine. 
Hell or high water, games or vengeance, lust or love&#133;she&#39;ll come back 
to me.&quot;

&quot;You sound so sure.&quot;

Dorothy shook her head, &quot;We own each other&#133; marked each other&#133; fifty 
years or another lifetime she&#39;ll find her way back to me. And I will 
find my way back to her. Now&#133;let&#39;s go eat, and I&#39;ll find something to 
occupy that bruised ego of yours.&quot;

Once
Twice
It was nice
But you know we go
Off and on to our separate corners
Laugh about the time
Make fun of the rhyme
Because through silence and spell
You know very well
Lasting is a joke
And forever&#133;
Is hollow sound

Things always looked different in the quiet space of the morning 
after. The light of day brought the shadowed details into the 
foreground. The large collection of well worn books on the shelves, 
the perfectly polished shine of the antique furniture, including the 
bedposts, and the soft and subtle scent that was an obvious after 
effect of the tiny, and fragile perfume bottles uniformly cluttering 
the top of the dresser. She was sitting on the edge of the queen sized 
bed, crisp white sheet sloppily draped around her waist, top bare and 
exposed, unable to stick to her plans of escaping before the lady 
woke. 

There were a million things she wanted to blame&#133;dancing, her 
stepbrother for insisting she get out of the house, but mostly her 
self for not being strong enough to fight whatever pull had forced her 
into the lady&#39;s arms, a pull that was decidedly delicate and tender. 
She sucked in a deep breath as she turned to watch the lady sleeping. 
So different in the light&#133; softer&#133; every single commanding feature of 
the lady less controlled and rigid. Violet-gray eyes playing over a 
near flawless back, marred only by the partially hidden tattoo peeking 
from under sheets. It was a curious almost familiar design and if 
Catherine Bloom had not feared waking the lady she would have pulled 
the sheet back father so she could see the rest of it. On cue the 
slightly older woman began to stir. Catherine reached out to touch the 
woman next to her, fingers gracing a supple shoulder.

&quot;You stayed&quot; the lady whispered, turning onto her side, slight smile 
running over her lips.

Catherine wasn&#39;t sure what to do. She could lean back into the 
pillows, or stay where she was&#133;away and detached, safe and sound. 

&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; She sat up ignoring the sheets gliding away from 
her, reaching out a hand to pull Catherine&#39;s retreating gaze to her 
own. &quot;I don&#39;t believe I caught it last night.&quot;

&quot;Catherine.&quot;

&quot;Catherine&quot;, the lady echoed and it sounded like a song. &quot;Catherine 
I&#39;m Une.&quot; Her eyes seemed to spark when she said it, then she chuckled 
at an unspoken joke.

&quot;Une?&quot; She quirked an eyebrow.

&quot;Last name&quot;, was the reply. &quot;My first name is my little secret.&quot;

&quot;Anyone privy to that secret?&quot; 

Une&#39;s smile turned from amused to mischievous as she slid closer to 
the smaller young woman. Arms easing Catherine back into the plush and 
warm bed. 

So different&#133;

The way their lips met less hurried and ravenous then the previous 
evening. Une&#39;s brown hair tousled around her shoulders, nothing 
uniform or militaristic about her. Catherine found herself shivering 
at the touch. She hated not being in control, not knowing what was 
next. If it was a fling or the start of something she could not tell. 
Her mind told her it was a brief affair and her heart echoed the 
sentiment but secretly wished for something deeper. Either way she was 
sure the lady would leave her bruised.

&quot;I love that you&#39;re unsure&quot;; Une said as she pulled away. &quot;You always 
seemed so confident whenever I saw you.&quot;

&quot;When did you see me?&quot; 

&quot;With your stepbrother&#133;I&#39;ve known him for ages you know.&quot;

&quot;He never ment-&quot;

&quot;Of course he wouldn&#39;t&quot;, she smiled, dipping back to reclaim the 
sweetness of the lips below her. &quot;He wouldn&#39;t want to give you any 
ideas.&quot;

&quot;Like running off and sleeping with someone I&#39;ve never even said two 
words to?&quot; She winked.

&quot;Exactly like that.&quot; Une sat back. &quot;Funny how protective he is of 
you.&quot;

Catherine shook her head. &quot;He cares&#133; we&#39;re all we have. Listen I&#133;&quot;

&quot;Want to leave?&quot; The lady pinned Catherine to the bed. &quot;I don&#39;t want 
you to leave just yet.&quot;

&quot;When do you want me to leave?&quot;

Hazelnut brown eyes shut briefly and then opened as she replied, &quot;When 
we&#39;re through.&quot;

I can feel your touch
Soft and sweet
Gentle and easy
Guiding me along
Why me

And in the distance
There is an end waiting
Dark and sad
Brief and still
Why me

Why need my lips
My kiss
My hips and scent
Why breathe me in
Why me

And I know you are called to another
A something you can&#39;t fight
A lighter touch that means so much
Why me
 Why me

They had fallen asleep again when a phone ringing ripped the slumber 
from them. Une slid out of the bed and from the hallway Catherine 
could hear all the deciding factors. The lady walked back into the 
room whispered a sigh and watched the disappointment grow on her first 
time lover&#39;s face. First time? Only time? Whatever it had to end... 
Didn&#39;t it? 

&quot;I suppose that was someone privy to your first name&quot;, Catherine said 
finally, sitting up, ready to gather her things and leave.

&quot;It was.&quot; She raised an eyebrow as the young woman began to move. 
&quot;Want to met her?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think-&quot;

&quot;She wants to met you&#133;but you know her already&quot;, she paused and then 
considered, &quot;Or so I was lead to believe.&quot; 

Une&#39;s gaze was unavoidable, penetrating, sought and found answers far 
too easily. Catherine tried looking away but found she could not.

&quot;That tattoo&quot;, Catherine muttered. &quot;On your lower back&#133;what does it 
mean?&quot;

&quot;Goddess.&quot;

&quot;And your goddess&#133;does she have a similar mark?&quot;

&quot;Yes&#133;hers says-&quot;

&quot;Lady&quot;, she interrupted. &quot;Don&#39;t so this to me.&quot;

The lady stalked closer, took a seat next to the young woman, wrapped 
an arm around a dancer&#39;s perfect waist, and kissed her shoulder, &quot;She 
says it&#39;s fine&#133; Come with me?&quot;

&quot;Une, I-&quot;

&quot;Please&quot;, she traced her fingers over a small spot on the dancers 
lower back. Fingers perfectly mimicking the black ink of the tattoo 
that resided there. &quot;Please, &#39;my star&#39;&#133; It will do us all some good.&quot; 

She brushed back Catherine&#39;s ruddy brown hair, clearing a space to 
rest her lips and take a taste, leave a mark.

You, me, her
You, me, her
Over and over
A snake eating its own tale
You
Me
Her
And who loves who more
Is never really answered
Because who loves who more 
Was never the question asked
You, me, her
Me, you, her
Her, me, you
We&#39;re lost
Found again in something that kills
A darkness thick that answers all
It&#39;s not about the love
It&#39;s about the fall

&quot;You lied to me&quot;, he hissed bitterly as she passed him.

&quot;Did I?&quot;

&quot;You said it wasn&#39;t your doing.&quot;

She smirked, &quot;It wasn&#39;t. I had nothing to do with any of it.&quot; She 
glanced over her shoulder the restaurant was full of people and she 
was expected at a far corner booth. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you get back to work 
Nichol?&quot;

&quot;How could you?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t start with me&quot;, the goddess warned. &quot;I said you couldn&#39;t have 
it all&#133; I don&#39;t recall saying I couldn&#39;t.&quot;
 
He growled, &quot;It&#39;s unfair to the lady.&quot;

&quot;I enjoy your concern but she&#39;s the one who went and grabbed the other 
not me. You lost Nichol&#133; so are you going to pay the price or not?&quot;

&quot;Fine&#133; You won&#39;t be so lucky next time.&quot;

&quot;If you say so&#133;now&quot;, she reached into her pocket and pulled out a 
card. &quot;This is his number. Give him a call and for God&#39;s sake be 
polite when he kisses you goodnight.&quot; She handed over the card, which 
he snatched away quickly. &quot;Trowa&#39;s so lucky to have you&quot;, she pat his 
cheek quickly and practically skipped off to her table.

A game isn&#39;t a game until its won
Until it ends and there is victor
Trophies given I&#39;m out ahead
Trophies given&#133;
I&#39;m lucky for such friends
