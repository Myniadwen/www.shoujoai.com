<h1>Valkyrie (part 13 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/twig.html">Twig</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gundam/valkyrie-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>	Relena knew she was completely tongue tied, that nothing she could
say would come out sounding right or even understandable, and so she
remained silent, just staring up at the Gundam.  

The Valkyrie almost seemed to be staring back down at her, looking her
over just as she was judging it, standing proud and tall, powerful, but
yet somehow comforting, and protective.
	
//I always used to tease them, Duo and the rest, for treating their suits
like they were alive - but now I think I know what they meant.//

	Howard strolled along, footsteps ringing on the metal floor,
moving closer to the massive suit, obviously expecting them to follow. 
Relena followed Dorothy, who was well ahead, already darting around the
legs of the Gundam, turning every few seconds to smile at the man in the
bright pink shirt.

	&quot;I never thought - I mean, I remember when you showed me the
initial designs, but I never thought it would actually get built.&quot;

	&quot;Neither did we!&quot;  A voice shouted from high above, and Relena
realized that there were about a hundred people on various levels of the
building all watching them, leaning over scaffolds or out of doorways. 
Apparently, their arrival was an important event.

	Howard looked up towards the man that had called out to them, and
smiled.

	&quot;He&#39;s right, you know.	If I told you how many times we nearly got
caught, the times we had to hold transfer shipments on the moon because of
possible raids... We were sweating in buckets for a while there.&quot;

	The bearded man tilted his head down, and grinned.  Relena could
see a wicked, merry anarchy in his eyes.  No doubt, he hadn&#39;t minded the
danger at all.

	&quot;But she&#39;s 100% now, totally battle-ready.  We just need to get
you suited up, little miss, and she&#39;ll be all ready for a test drive.&quot;

	The brunette realized belatedly that he was looking at her.

	&quot;Me?!  I - I can&#39;t possibly...&quot;  

	Relena was merely thinking of the piloting skills, the time to
learn how to operate the Gundam that she simply didn&#39;t have, but Dorothy
and Howard seemed to take it some other way, looked at each other for a
long moment.

	&quot;I don&#39;t think she understands why this suit is so special.&quot; 
Dorothy said, before giving the Valkyrie an impulsive hug, murmuring
&quot;super cool!&quot; under her breath.

	Howard nodded.	

	&quot;Let&#39;s go up and get a look at the schematics, Relena.	I&#39;ll
explain the suit&#39;s systems to you, and then you can make a final
decision.&quot;

----------------------------

	A few minutes later, they were sitting in a small conference room
at the top of the hanger.  Relena couldn&#39;t help but notice the way Dorothy
looked behind her every few minutes, out the window, to where the Valkyrie
stood.

	//I&#39;m going to lose my girlfriend to a Gundam suit.//

	Relena was also well aware of the twenty or so technicians,
scientists and mechanics also standing around near the doors and windows
in the room, watching what was going on.  She could hear them murmur each
time Howard brought up a new series of diagrams, heard a few &quot;damn rights&quot;
and other sounds of pride and appreciation as Howard started his speech. 
They weren&#39;t just watching him, she knew, they were watching her too,
trying to figure out what her reaction to their masterpiece would be.

	//They&#39;re so happy... and proud.  Nothing like the people who
designed the other Gundam suits, not nearly as bitter.//

	&quot;The Valkyrie suit has been designed with all the data we could
gather from the battles fought with all other suits, including space-only
vehicles and mobile doll battalions, though she is neither of those.&quot;

	&quot;We could have her space-ready in a week, ma&#39;am!&quot;  Someone outside
the room shouted, and Relena could hear other people agreeing, a few
people even clapped.

	&quot;Excuse me.&quot;

	Howard glared at the door, until silence settled back over the
room.  He grinned at Relena.

	&quot;Sorry.  This has been a damn big, damn risky project for all of
us.  You&#39;ll have to excuse us for being a bit slap happy.&quot;

	Howard clicked a button, and the slide on the screen switched to a
forward view of the Valkyrie.

	&quot;The Valkyrie is, at the very least, the equal of any other
current Gundam suit.  Given what data we have, we also know that it is
probably the fastest suit in existence.  Excellent maneuverability,
incredible agility.&quot;
  
Relena heard another person cheer outside the room, and saw Howard roll
his eyes.

&quot;... and yes, we have to give our praise to Simon, who spent six weeks
recalibrating the main engine systems and Gillian, who spent another six
redesigning the entire base turning mechanism.&quot;
	
Everyone clapped, cheered, and just generally caused a ruckus for a while.
 Relena had the feeling this was standard operating procedure.
	
&quot;/Anyway/, the reason you have been brought here, Miss Peacecraft, and the
real reason we&#39;re /all/ excited about this suit -  The Valkyrie is the
first non-lethal combat Gundam suit in existence.&quot;

	Everyone was silent, and Relena felt Dorothy&#39;s hand reach down and
wrap around hers, squeezing it tight.  The other girl was watching her
reaction with a wide, hopeful smile.

	Howard continued on, and the entire mood of the room only seemed
to become more energized as he spoke.

	&quot;We&#39;ve collected some of the best theoretical concepts for
non-lethal peacekeeping over the last four or five decades, and have come
up with, what I think is an incredible system.&quot;

	He gestured to the schematics, although Relena couldn&#39;t follow
what she was supposed to be looking at.

	&quot;First of all, the Gundam&#39;s computer system automatically targets
essential but low-kill spots in situations of hand-to-hand combat.  Knee
joints, non-armored hip and shoulder segments... all of these could
conceivably put a suit out of commission without endangering the pilot.&quot;

	&quot;There are also some killer weaknesses in Taurus and Virgo suits,
ma&#39;am!	I&#39;d be happy to clue you in!&quot;  

Once again, someone added their opinion, interrupting Howard.  He merely
shrugged, giving up hope of having a quiet conversation as a debate
outside the room sprouted up.

	Relena didn&#39;t understand what they were arguing about, except that
she kept hearing the words &quot;Wing Zero&quot; and &quot;Phillips-head screwdriver&quot;
over and over. Layered with that, and another few arguments, she could
hear someone explaining the exact stress-fracture patterns that would
develop along the left wing panel of the Sandrock if it got hit with a 5
kg asteroid.  

Howard quietly stood up, walked over, and slammed the door, locking it
behind him.  A loud groan of disappointment rose up behind the door, and
Relena could see the technicians staring at the pink-shirted man with
puppy eyes. Howard smiled at his compatriots, and calmly pulled down the
blinds.
	
&quot;There.&quot;  He turned, still grinning.  

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but it would just be easier to get this done all at once, and
some of those guys are /completely/ obsessed with these suits.	They&#39;ll
talk your ear off for hours about the Epyion&#39;s outer space backup left
rudder propulsion system... I know, I&#39;ve heard it.&quot;
	
&quot;It&#39;s really a non-lethal Gundam?!&quot; 
 
	Relena finally felt she could speak, if only to ask a stupid
question.  Howard beamed, flopping back in his chair, flipping through
some more slides.

	&quot;Mm-hmm.  Completely so, all from my original design, pardon my
gloating.&quot;  He nodded.	&quot;That&#39;s why we did it here, with such obsessive
pacifist help and such security in gathering materials.  I wasn&#39;t going to
let any of those warmongering morons lay a hand on her. I made damn sure
they didn&#39;t.&quot;

	Relena noticed some of the slides he flipped through looked like
weapons, or at least this suit&#39;s equivalent.  Howard noticed her concern.

	&quot;Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;re not weapons, not like you think, anyway. 
We&#39;ve got a few offensive items to deal with the lower-end suits,
basically anything that isn&#39;t an actual Gundam suit.  Magnets, for
example, that can hold a suit&#39;s arms and legs together, completely
immobilize it, and a variation on that-&quot; 

Howard started to laugh.  

&quot;It&#39;s this thing some of the engineers came up with... it makes the entire
suit start to shake like a maraca.  We haven&#39;t loaded too many of either
prototype into the actual suit, we&#39;d like to see how they test first.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s also a high-frequency communications scrambler, it can wipe out
just about anything within a pretty wide radius.  We&#39;ve got it working now
so that you can either just destroy the communications, or you can play
something over it, like...&quot;

&quot;La Bamba.&quot;  

Dorothy murmured, now grinning just as widely as Howard was.  

&quot;I heard that the test song was La Bamba.&quot;

&quot;You heard right.&quot;  Howard looked a little abashed, shaking his head as he
looked at Relena.

&quot;Please don&#39;t take our jokes the wrong way.  We&#39;re all serious here, but
we can&#39;t help but have a little fun with these morons, teasing all those
guys out there who&#39;d rather fight than party.  The scrambler works like a
charm, and if you can annoy your enemy as well as stop them... why not?&quot;

&quot;Did you ever get the hard foam system operational?&quot; Dorothy asked.

&quot;Yup.&quot;	Howard flipped forward a few more frames, focusing on a small
round hole inside one of Valkyrie&#39;s arms.

&quot;There&#39;s a couple more of these loaded into her other arm.  These will
shoot out a foam that instantly hardens on contact with just about
anything.  It&#39;ll freeze a non-moving Taurus suit solid to the ground, we
tested that out already.  But God only knows what it would do to a moving
Gundam...&quot;
  
Howard sighed. 

&quot;There&#39;s a lot we haven&#39;t actually field tested - the magnets, the
shakers, the hard foam on moving objects.  We&#39;ve got a sticky tar, it
spreads out over the visors of just about any suits, brings visibility
down to nil, that works pretty well.&quot;

&quot;Defense?&quot;  Dorothy interrupted. Relena started to wonder just how much
the blonde knew, just how high up in the design and creation process she
was, she seemed to know what she was talking about.  Howard nodded.

&quot;One arm shield, set parallel along the side of the right arm to avoid
battle damage if you get hit.  We&#39;re kind of proud of this, it sprouts up
like any mobile doll shield, with its own generators and such - it&#39;s a
damn strong shield.  But with the speed and agility of that suit, trust
me, getting hit will not be a problem.&quot;

Howard stood up, and moved to the door. As it opened, Relena could hear
the sound of many footsteps scrambling away, clearing a path.  The man in
the pink shirt stepped out, and they followed behind him, back into the
hangar.  Howard pointed to the large, black wing that stretched out along
the suit&#39;s left side.

&quot;That stabilizes the balance enough to fly her, or at least we think it
should.  Like I said, there&#39;s a lot we have left to test.  A whole lot.
&quot;
Show them the big gun!!!&quot;  Someone hollered, and the entire scaffold shook
with the sound of delighted war whoops, and chantings of &quot;Big Gun! Big
Gun!&quot;

&quot;All right, all right.&quot; Howard waved his hands, waiting for silence.

&quot;Last, and definitely /not/ least, there&#39;s the Valkyrie&#39;s primary weapon,
the Longbow.&quot;

Howard gestured toward it, but it took Relena a moment to realize what she
was looking at was not part of the scaffolding, and not a part of the
building either.  

The massive weapon leaned against the side of the opposite wall, a long,
thin cannon that tapered down slightly at one end.  It curved down near
the middle, and Relena figured that was where it would rest on the
Valkyrie&#39;s shoulder.  As for the rest of it, she was stumped.

&quot;The Longbow is a massive EMP cannon, designed to turn /any/ suit into the
world&#39;s largest paperweight in one shot.&quot;

Relena could almost hear the technicians and engineers salivating behind
her.  They were already manic about the Valkyrie, the Longbow was
obviously everyone&#39;s coup de&#39; grace.
  
&quot;We&#39;ve designed the cannon with two main abilities.  One, it can simply
destroy the electrical systems of its target, but two, it can also drain
the target&#39;s power, and redirect that energy into the cannon, and the
Valkyrie.  It will allow you infinite power if you choose your targets
right.&quot;

&quot;Relena?&quot;

The brunette turned, surprised to see Dorothy watching her with slightly
wary, but hopeful eyes.

&quot;It&#39;s also, a bicycle built for two.&quot;  She smiled.  &quot;It has a two man, or
two woman, cockpit.&quot;

Howard shifted uncomfortably after a moment, and Relena realized she was
under the center spotlight once more, the tour was done.  

There were so many questions she needed answers to, the brunette merely
picked the first one that came to mind.  

&quot;How /did/ you manage all this?  Where did you get the materials, the
supplies, the manpower?!&quot;

Howard crossed his arms, looking up into the invisible heavens far above
the roof of the hangar.

&quot;Miss Peacecraft, there are /many/ supporters of Absolute Pacifism on this
planet, and in every colony out in space.  There are too many families who
have lost someone in a battle they didn&#39;t want to be a part of, part a war
they probably didn&#39;t even understand.&quot;

Howard gestured to the hanger around him.

&quot;Most of the people working here have lost someone special in a fight on
some distant shore.  Most of the money we used to build this facility, and
to create the Valkyrie, have come from people, foundations, and countries
that simply are tired of war.&quot;

Relena could see some of the other men nodding in agreement behind the man
in the pink shirt.

&quot;We&#39;ve decided, we believe that the Valkyrie - and you - are our best hope
for peace now.&quot;

Relena looked around her, at the suddenly somber eyes of every person in
the crowd, at Howard, and finally at Dorothy.  

//My Dorothy.//

The brunette could see the hope there, in Dorothy&#39;s gray-blue eyes, hope
and fear and love.  

Yet again, she was being asked to take the lead, to be in command, and to
make a choice that could affect the rest of the world for better or worse.
 Except this time, Relena knew, she would not be alone, and she would not
be powerless, left to fight with words while everyone moved on.  This
would be a burden she could carry, this was a fight she knew she could
win.
	
&quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;
	
The cheer that went up inside the hangar, rattled back and forth across
the metal walls, and nearly deafened them all.

-------------------------

	&quot;I said I&#39;d do it, but I still don&#39;t see /how/...&quot;
	
Relena and Dorothy were walking down one of the hanger&#39;s hallways,
following a technician back to the Valkyrie&#39;s navigation simulation.  

	&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Relena.  We&#39;ve had this worked out for months. The
hardest part was dealing with the anxiety of wondering - of hoping you&#39;d
agree to it.&quot;

	The brunette shook her head.

	&quot;No matter /how/ much I agree to this, Dorothy, it still doesn&#39;t
mean I can just sit down and pilot a Gundam suit.&quot;

	The technician in front of them turned around, grinning like a
madman.

	&quot;Trust me, ma&#39;am.  Once you try out this system, there&#39;s no going
back.&quot;

	It would have sounded ominous, if he hadn&#39;t high-fived the other
technicians on his way through the door.

	Relena couldn&#39;t believe the laid-back atmosphere, the lack of
uniform, in dress, thought or behavior in Howard&#39;s group of scientists. 
More than one person behind the computer had piercings, primary-color
hair, tattoos or all three in a mix-and-match combination.  Only a handful
of them, Howard included, were older than twenty-five.
	
//And yet, they&#39;ve developed this amazing machine.  This really is the
future.  These people are all working towards your future, a peaceful
future.//

	Relena couldn&#39;t have been happier.
	
She and Dorothy were seated in dentist-style chairs, side by side, and
every once in a while another person would come up and attach more
scanners and electrodes to her face, or wrists, or neck.
	
&quot;You nervous?  You&#39;re heartbeat&#39;s a little high.&quot;  

One of the techs said as he attached a band around her arm.  Out of the
corner of her eye, Relena saw Dorothy give her a comforting grin.
	
&quot;What is all this, please?  What are you going to do?&quot;
	
&quot;Operating system hookup.  We&#39;re going to make it so you can fight in the
Valkyrie, so it will respond to the way you fight.&quot;
	
&quot;I don&#39;t fight.&quot;
	
The man chuckled, and she hoped he realized she was serious, that she
really didn&#39;t know what she was getting in to.

&quot;We&#39;re going to map your brainwaves, physical data and reaction times into
the Gundam&#39;s computer, so that it will react in tandem with your personal
abilities.&quot;

He said it so simply, she almost wanted to believe him.

//But I know me, and I know that I /can&#39;t/ do this!//

	&quot;You do realize, as soon as I get into the real thing, you&#39;re
going to be witness to the shortest flight ever, don&#39;t you?  I&#39;ll turn
your masterpiece into tinkertoys faster than you can blink.&quot;
	
The technician laughed at her, snapping one final monitor to her arm.
	
&quot;Give us a little credit, here.  Those guys out there may have designed
the hardware, but we worked like dogs on the software too.  Just relax,
and let the computer do the work.&quot;

	The man pushed a panel of switches and buttons under her hands,
and slid a helmet onto her head, with a dark visor completely covering her
eyes.  Relena couldn&#39;t see or hear anything, until a slightly muffled,
almost electronic voice spoke into her ear.

	&quot;You hear me, Relena?&quot;

	&quot;Uh... yeah, Howard.  Loud and clear.&quot;	Relena wondered if there
was some special fighter pilot jargon she was supposed to know, but
figured she was too nervous to remember to use it anyway.
	
&quot;Now, this isn&#39;t much like the Valkyrie&#39;s actual systems, the helmet, the
controls, but this will make it easier for us to load your data into her
computers.  Just watch what happens, and react to it as best you can. 
I&#39;ll switch Dorothy&#39;s radio on in a moment, so you two can talk this out. 
Remember, just try to do what you can, and let her do what she can, and
eventually it will just happen.&quot;
	
Relena looked down, instantly forgetting what every button on the controls
did, except that only one of them would do what she needed at a time.

	//I&#39;m dead... I&#39;m dead I&#39;m dead I&#39;m dead.//

	&quot;Uh, yeah.  Right.  Roger?  Um... over and out.&quot;

--------------------------

	The first few test simulations went just as badly as Relena had
predicted they would.  She flew the Valkyrie right into a mountain, after
she had already let it drop like a stone and impale in the ground, twice. 


Relena was unable to find any button she needed, let alone attempt to
control the engines, and she and Dorothy had overheated everything more
than once simply trying to make the weapons work, often reaching for the
same switch at the same time.  

Most everything the brunette did caused error bells to ring.  After a
while, it felt like a bowl of crickets was living inside her helmet.  
	
Relena knew Dorothy had trained, at least a little, with systems like
this, and felt awful, knowing that the bumbling, horrible attempt to pilot
was all her fault.
	&quot;It&#39;s all right Relena.  Give it time.&quot;
	
&quot;I don&#39;t think we could /ever/ have enough time.&quot;  Relena murmured back,
feeling miserable.  
	
There was no response from Howard or the tech team, just a blinking flash
as one simulation stopped, usually with them dead in some way or another,
and the whir of a motor as another program started up.	Despite her
misery, Relena was impressed by how many situations they had loaded up,
snow and rain, water, sky, both in the countryside and over major cities.
	
&quot;Oops!	Sorry!&quot;  Relena winced as she accidentally kicked the top off of
one of the domes at St. Basil&#39;s cathedral, hearing Dorothy giggle through
the radio link for a long, long time.

The Valkyrie was an earth-based Gundam, but someday, Howard had said, he
hoped it would even get a chance to see the deepest reaches of space.

//...and they expect /me/ to pilot it there?!//
	
Relena kept at the controls, always doing her best but never feeling like
anything but a slow-witted idiot.

	//I swear, I&#39;ll never tease Duo again!!//  

It almost felt as if, every now and again, the engines /were/ responding
slightly faster with each attempt she made.  The brunette wondered if she
was actually feeling the machine react faster, move better, or if it was
simply something she wanted to feel so badly that she had convinced
herself she could.
	
//I /want/ to do this, damn it!  I don&#39;t want to let Howard and Dorothy
and everyone down!//
  
	As they practiced, a pattern slowly developed between the two
girls.	 Dorothy started working the guns more, focusing on the attack and
shield defense, while Relena dodged and maneuvered, working the Gundam in
the space between earth and sky, each girl slowly finding their own niche
within the system.
	
Then, all at once, something just /clicked/.
	
Relena couldn&#39;t believe the ease, the incredible supple power she suddenly
felt under her hands, the exhilaration pouring through her as she led a
chase of suits along the lower part of a river valley, dodging through
tight crevasses, running low to avoid side fire.  She could hear Dorothy
breathing hard in the radio link, murmuring slightly as she lined up her
shots.	Relena&#39;s eyes narrowed as she saw an opening ahead, a place that
they could have a single second to turn and attack, to bring this battle
to a decisive end, if she played things out just right.
	
&quot;Dorothy, look ahead.&quot;	She waited for a moment, until she thought the
blonde followed her logic.

&quot;Let&#39;s bring things to a close, shall we?&quot;
	
She heard Dorothy laugh breathlessly, still laying down cover fire behind
them, actually stopping a suit in its tracks with the hard foam, sending
it tumbling to stick against the side of a cliff.  

Relena pushed the Valkyrie forward, feeling it react to her slightest
direction, no longer separate from her, almost anticipating her movements.
 She could feel her heart racing, hands clenching the controls in
excitement.
	
//This is /incredible/!!!//

	Relena&#39;s eyes narrowed as she approached the slight gap between
the rocks.  She reached out and flipped up the Longbow&#39;s charging
mechanism, still shooting across the bottom of the valley, close enough to
leave a wake in the water behind her.
	
//All right, steady.  Keep it steady.//

	&quot;I&#39;m ready, Relena.&quot;  Dorothy murmured.
	
Relena eased the pressure off one leg&#39;s propulsion rocket, just slightly,
not enough to even be noticed by the other pilots, but she could tell. 
She was holding off on purpose.  Waiting.
	
//Almost, almost...//

	&quot;NOW!!!&quot;
	
Relena shot through the tiny gap in the rocks, and cut the power to one
leg, bracing for impact as she cut the power to the other side a second
later.	The extra second of propulsion turned the Gundam into a wild spin,
sent the suit sliding back in the water as she landed on both feet, facing
the gap.  

Dorothy had already done her job, setting up a wide layer of foam and tar
that shot back through the gap they had cleared only moments before.  The
three suits following them tumbled together in chaos as they fell through
the small crevasse, unable to dodge either Dorothy&#39;s trap or the massive
burst of electromagnetic energy that sent them all crashing to the ground
with a single, perfect shot.
	
&quot;YES!!!!&quot;  Relena screamed, hearing Dorothy&#39;s whoops of joy and laughter,
watching the simulation dissolve around her.  She grinned as she heard the
slight clicking, the mechanical sound of another program coming to life. 
The brunette slid back into her seat, wrapping her hands around the
controls.
	
&quot;Ready to go again, Catalonia?&quot;  She murmured, and heard a fierce chuckle
in response.
	
&quot;Lead the way, Peacecraft.  Lead the way.&quot;

---------------------------

	&quot;How long have they been in there?&quot;  Howard yawned, wiping his
eyes.  He had fallen asleep a few hours ago, and was now slowly eating a
blue-frosted doughnut, sipping slightly at too-hot coffee, trying to wake
himself back up.  

The tech turned to him, slowly munching on his own bowl of frosted
cornflakes, and grinned.

	&quot;Sixteen hours.  We&#39;ve run them through 97 percent of the
simulations, and they&#39;ve only gotten better since the first hour.&quot;  

He pointed through the glass to the room below, where Relena Peacecraft
was guiding the virtual Valkyrie through a series of caves.
	
&quot;Peacecraft took on the underwater series without even thinking about it. 
She didn&#39;t hesitate, she just dove in. I don&#39;t know how she knew the suit
could work underwater, and that blonde, she&#39;s got killer instincts.  The
girls, the suit, the system - they work together perfectly.  This is going
better than we could have ever imagined.&quot;

	&quot;No.&quot;  Howard shook his head, grinning.  &quot;This is what I was
counting on.  This is just what I expected.&quot;
  
He smiled broadly.

	&quot;War without death.  Fighting without lethal consequences.  A
chance for the leader of Absolute Pacifism to defend her country and her
principles at the same time.&quot;  

	Howard paused, blinking, as if surprised by his own moment of
soliloquy.

	&quot;Cool, man.  Very cool.&quot;  

He rapped the scientist on the shoulder.  &quot;Want to play a game of
Ping-Pong?&quot;
	
Another technician, a few booths away, looked up.

	&quot;They&#39;re all done now, sir.  We have all the information for the
Valkyrie&#39;s main systems.  It&#39;s ready to load.&quot;

	&quot;All right.&quot;  

The tech reached out, flipped a few switches, ending the animations.  He
flipped on the switch for the speaker in the training room.

	&quot;Hey, Miss Peacecraft, Miss Catalonia, you can take all that stuff
off now, one of our guys will be in there to help you.&quot;
  
He could see Relena already removing the heavy helmet.	Her eyes were
slightly glazed with exertion and hours of practice, but she was smiling
broadly, and she and Dorothy exchanged excited glances.

	&quot;We&#39;ve got everything we need.	If you want to return home, we&#39;ll
call you as soon as we set the system up and get ready to give the
Valkyrie her first real sendoff.  Right now...&quot; 

The man chuckled.  

&quot;Right now, I gotta go play Ping-Pong with Howard.  Later.&quot;

-----------------------------

	The ride back was silent, each girl lost in her own thoughts. 
Dorothy tried more than once to break the still, but couldn&#39;t seem to
think of anything to say, especially since Relena was staring out the
window, back to her for the entire ride.

	It had been exhilarating to fly the Valkyrie, even in simulation. 
It was absolutely wonderful, an affirmation of everything Dorothy had ever
believed about war, the enjoyment of battle, the thrill of victory.  

Of course, for Relena, that could very well have been the problem.

	//I know she enjoyed it, I know that for sure.	But maybe now, she
realizes she didn&#39;t want to enjoy it.  Maybe she&#39;s angry with me for
forcing that on her, for making her feel that way about fighting.//

	It was a scary thought, and Dorothy desperately wanted to ask the
other girl, to find out what Relena was really thinking, but all her
questions refused to leave her lips, wadding up inside her chest like a
cold, wet ball of tissue paper.

	As soon as they got back home, and got out of the car, both girls
quickly stripped off the coverall tops they had been given, sighing in
relief as the cool air hit their bare arms.

	&quot;I never thought white-t shirts could be such a great fashion
statement.&quot;  Relena murmured, walking into the house.  Dorothy picked up a
garden hose near a plot of flowers, shivering just slightly in the cool
morning air.  

It was early, the sun had just rose, and Dorothy knew she should have been
exhausted.  They /had/ spent the entire night fighting, running through
simulation after simulation, but the nervous fear she felt now was easily
enough to keep her from feeling tired.

	//She didn&#39;t sound angry, but maybe - I don&#39;t know, maybe...//

	Dorothy began lightly misting the flowers, trying to do anything
to keep from thinking, from imagining what she would do if Relena really
/was/ angry with her.

	The brunette reappeared a moment later, tossing the daily
newspaper behind her, back through the door after only a glance at the
cover.

	&quot;Nothing yet today.  The Sank is still at stalemate, at least for
now.&quot;

	&quot;Maybe they&#39;ve come up with something else on their own?  Another
way to get out of this without a war.&quot;

	Relena laughed bitterly.

	&quot;Not a chance.	My brother, he /doesn&#39;t/ negotiate.&quot;

	The brunette sighed, leaning slightly against the house, watching
Dorothy water the flowers.  Try as she might, Dorothy could not interpret
the look in her eyes.  Relena finally spoke, quietly, watching the blonde
closely for a reaction.

	&quot;How is it that you manage to understand my dream, but completely
misinterpret it... all at the same time?&quot;

	Dorothy flinched.

	//Damn it.  Damn it, she won&#39;t - she doesn&#39;t want to...  Aw, damn
it to /hell/!//

	&quot;You don&#39;t have to pilot it, Relena.&quot;  It was hard to say the
words, but she got them out anyway.  &quot;They can always find someone else.&quot;

	&quot;But you want me to, don&#39;t you?&quot;

	Dorothy&#39;s head jerked up, she stopped watching the flowers,
staring at Relena in surprise and confusion, stunned by the other girl&#39;s
simple, soft tone.

	&quot;It would be perfect, Relena.  I... I think it would be
wonderful.&quot;

	Dorothy couldn&#39;t deny it.  The idea of both of them, fighting for
peace in their very own Gundam had been something in Dorothy&#39;s thoughts
from the moment she heard the word &quot;Valkyrie.&quot;	Fighting, in a suit that
was the solid reality of Relena&#39;s dream, the ideal cast into metal - it
was more than she could hope for, really.

	//Relena, you would make war perfect. You would make it into
something glorious, and wonderful.//

	The blonde wasn&#39;t sure what Relena was thinking anymore, wasn&#39;t
sure what the brunette wanted to hear, or what she had already decided.
She breathed in sharply when the other girl stepped up to her, as a warm
hand traced the curve of her side, from thigh to waist, and higher,
finally cupping her breast in a firm, almost decisive way. 

Relena pushed Dorothy gently against the side of the house, 
pressing in close.  She rested her head against the blonde&#39;s shoulder for
a moment before looking up.

	&quot;I... I never thought of it, not in a million years. I never
thought a Gundam could do anything but kill... and I never thought there
was a way to peacefully protect my people, that I could really /do/
something to bring peace to the Sank, and the world.&quot;

	Dorothy tried to pay attention, knowing Relena was teasing her as
much as confiding in her, purposefully destroying the blonde&#39;s
concentration as she massaged the tip of Dorothy&#39;s breast, rubbing the pad
of her thumb against the hard nipple, which was easily visible through the
blonde&#39;s thin, white shirt.  It was also easy enough to see, when Dorothy
looked down at the brunette&#39;s matching attire, that Relena was as excited
as she was.

	&quot;It&#39;s wonderful, Dorothy.  You&#39;ve given me so much.  You saved me,
when I thought everything was lost.  You gave me your heart, your love,
and now this...&quot;

	The blonde murmured softly as one of Relena&#39;s legs parted hers,
pushing her further back against the cool brick wall.  

The brunette kissed her, and Dorothy moaned into her open mouth as Relena
rocked slightly, leaning in and sending pulses of hot electricity rippling
out from her center.  The brunette&#39;s hand had not left her breast, and
Relena was now slowly kissing the side of her neck as well.  It was almost
too much to take.

	&quot;Dorothy...&quot; The girl&#39;s voice was feigning hilarious innocence as
she whispered in the blonde&#39;s ear.  &quot;How will I ever repay you?&quot;
	
&quot;I think - I-I&#39;m going to fall over.&quot; Dorothy whispered back, weak-kneed. 
Relena leaned in just a little harder, and Dorothy shuddered, tried not to
cry out, overwhelmed by the jolt of powerful pleasure that flooded her
senses.

	&quot;Yep, definitely going to fall over.  Mm-hmm.&quot;

	Relena chuckled again, but did not relent, explaining in that
innocent tone that she simply /had/ to find a way to repay Dorothy for her
kindness.

	Soon, the blonde forgot she was even standing.

-------------------------------

	&quot;Holy sheeeeeeeeit!&quot;

	Duo shifted uncomfortably from his position in the bushes, wishing
he had thought to wear looser pants as he watched the two girls make out.

	//Looser pants, and binoculars.  Good God, Heero is going to shit
kittens when he finds out about this.//

	It had been difficult enough to keep silent when Howard had called
him a few days ago, told him where to find Dorothy and Relena, and had
made him promise not to say anything to anyone.

	//Not because I care about what Zechs and Noin and the rest of
them want, but - geez, what a secret!!//

	He had scoped out the house much earlier that morning, in the
dark, but no one had been home, so he had decided to wait around for a
while.	None of the Gundam pilots were needed just yet.  Zechs didn&#39;t want
to make it look like they were preparing for a war until it was absolutely
unavoidable, which meant waiting for the Prime Minister to make the first
move.

	Duo believed what Howard had told him, that the brunette ruler of
the Sank was in no danger, but he still wanted to make sure.

	//Uh, well. I would definitely have to say it looks like Relena
isn&#39;t being held here against her own free will.//

	His thoughts skipped a beat as he saw Dorothy&#39;s pants slowly
crumple to the ground, heard the blonde loudly cry out her lover&#39;s name.

	//Huh.	uh... huh. Cool.//

	Duo had to turn around and sit down, almost had to cover his ears
in order to cool off enough to think, to remember what he was supposed to
do now.

	//She&#39;s all right.  She&#39;s /better/ than all right, if you ask me. 
Wow, Heero&#39;s going to fucking /explode/ when he figures out what&#39;s going
on.//

	Since Relena was all right for the moment, and well hidden, Duo
figured there was no point in rescuing her and taking her back to the
Sank.  Duo had noticed that Relena was miserable in the castle, and he had
been kind of worried about her in the days before her disappearance, that
she didn&#39;t look right, that she looked sick and pale.

	//Huh.// He thought, listening to more delightfully loud sounds
coming from behind him.  //She /sounds/ better, at least.//

	All kidding aside, there was just no reason to bring her back now.
 Relena was safer and happier here, and there wasn&#39;t much for her to do
even if she came back anyway.  

As far as Duo could tell, there was no way to stop this war short of
fighting it out.  If Relena came back afterward, there would be a good
chance of finding peace again, and taking the entire war as some sort of
horrible mistake that she had no control over.
	
//Not that I really understand this whole thing - or that I want to...//

Duo was pretty impressed with himself, that he had been able to do /any/
thinking at all with what he knew was going on behind him.  There was
nothing he could do, however, and no way to stop from looking back when he
heard the sound of a garden hose.

	The pilot turned around so fast his braid snapped like a whip in
the air, and he watched the two girls take turns hosing each other down,
until they were wrestling, half-naked, on the grass.  It really was every
dream he had ever had all rolled into one, in living color and surround
sound.

	//Hose.  Wet.  White... t-shirt.  Hose.  White.  Wet.  Wet. 
White.	Wet shirt.  Oh boy.//

	Duo knew that if Hilde ever found out about what he had seen, he
would be nothing but a smear across the side of a space station in less
time than it took to cook pizza rolls.	

Of course, that thought didn&#39;t occur to him until much later, along with
the happy realization that he would carry the memory of that morning in
crystal clarity, in the very front of his thoughts, for the rest of his
life.
