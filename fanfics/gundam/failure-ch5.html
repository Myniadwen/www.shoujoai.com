<h1>Failure of Vision (part 5 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rzrblade.html">Rzrblade33</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gundam/failure-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Relena is terrified of spiders. I know this because I was present when 
she spotted one in her limo. It was a fairly good sized one, but it 
was the same color as the seats and I probably would not have noticed 
it had she not shrieked loudly upon glimpsing it. She made me kill it 
because she was too frightened to get close enough to do it herself.

&quot;I hate bugs,&quot; she told me as she smoothed out her dress. &quot;Especially 
spiders. Horrible creatures, bulging eyes and so many legs.&quot; She 
shuddered in disgust.

I found myself imagining a black widow crawling on her skin and the 
way she would convulse as its tiny legs inched up her body. I wondered 
if she could bring herself to brush it away and kill it then.

She probably couldn&#146;t.

Then I found myself wondering if one could truly be considered a 
pacifist if she was having spiders and other such creatures killed. It 
is, after all, an act of violence on a species that is innocent. That 
spider didn&#146;t do anything besides crawling into the wrong pink limo. 
The dispute between the two could have been settled peacefully; we 
could have disposed of the insect without killing it. Isn&#146;t that the 
basis of pacifism?

So Relena is not only foolish but a hypocrite as well.

It is dinner now. Relena decided earlier that we would eat outside, to 
prove something to Duo I&#146;m sure but I can&#146;t fathom what. So the four 
of us are sitting in a charming little picnic table set up this 
afternoon near the back door.

Relena is talking about something, her right hand waving back and 
forth to emphasize whatever point she is making. Heero is next to her, 
listening intently and staring blankly at the sky, his book lying 
abandoned by his plate after Relena told him politely to put it away 
so they could converse. Duo is sitting beside me, folding his napkin 
into origami animals and tapping his foot continually on the ground, 
causing our seat to shake slightly and my patience to stretch.

And I&#146;m watching a spider crawl across the wood table, traveling 
slowly in the direction of Relena&#146;s left hand that remains sitting 
still.

It is tiny, less that a centimeter in length, and I&#146;m sure that I&#146;m 
the only one here who is observant enough to spot it amongst the other 
dots on the table. It&#146;s black with a yellow stripe down the center of 
its body. Although it could be a light orange. I really can&#146;t tell 
from this angle. As I said, it&#146;s too small in size for it to be 
poisonous so I opt not to mention it, only survey it carefully.

I so adore insects. They are truly superior to human beings. Even the 
most harmless of them has the ability to frighten such large numbers 
of people with its mere presence.

I once had a praying mantis as a pet when I was younger. An unusual 
pet, I know, but I loved it. I named it Mars, the god of war. I kept 
him in an aquarium, like one would keep a pet tarantula. He was larger 
than a normal mantis, at least 3 inches, and a much more beautiful 
green. I particularly enjoyed his eyes, so supernatural.

At night when I was alone, I&#146;d open a window and let a fly or two get 
inside the house. Then I&#146;d let Mars out of the aquarium and watch him 
catch and eat them, slowly as though savoring every bite. I was 
fascinated.

He died when I was 12. To honor his death, I flooded an ant colony and 
destroyed four spider webs and one egg.

The black spider in an inch away from Relena&#146;s hand now. It&#146;s 
proceeding at such a low speed. I wish it would hurry up.

Duo has stopped playing with his napkin. He and Heero are currently 
staring at each other, and I can see that they are having a silent 
conversation with their eyes. If Relena notices, she doesn&#146;t care and 
keeps talking.

She lifts her left hand suddenly to brush her hair out of her eyes, 
and I wince and inhale as the spider jumps back somewhat. Luckily she 
returns the hand to the table a second later, this time a little 
closer than it was before. I stare at the spider, willing it to 
continue.

It takes a hesitant step forward, its front two legs rising to rest on 
Relena&#146;s skin.

With a smirk, I raise my eyes to stare at her. She doesn&#146;t falter; she 
obviously doesn&#146;t notice.

The spider has now advanced up to her thumb and is moving 
significantly quicker than before, as though it somehow knows exactly 
what I want and is willing to help me achieve it. Arachnids are such 
lovely things, almost as good as a praying mantis. Almost.

A high-pitched shriek fills the air as Relena swats at her hand, 
sending the spider sailing through the air. It lands on the table in 
front of Heero. He blinks at it for a second until Relena begins 
hissing &quot;Kill it!&quot; loudly. In a swift motion he picks up his book and 
brings it down on the tiny insect. Duo and I both jump.

Heero lifts the book, and I can see the spider on the table, its legs 
twitching and curling as its life leaves it. I feel odd, guilty, and I 
look away.

Duo begins coughing suddenly, but I can hear the underlying laughter 
he is concealing. Apparently so does Heero, as he suddenly glares 
daggers at the other boy.

Relena is white and I can see her chest heaving. She smoothes out her 
skirt, and I grin at the familiar gesture and the memory that it 
conjures.

&quot;Such a dreadful creature, isn&#146;t it, Miss Relena?&quot; I say, hearing the 
amusement in my voice and not bothering to hide it.

She doesn&#146;t respond, only continues to stare at the corpse on the 
table and idly rub the back of her left hand, to relieve herself of 
the ghost still creeping and crawling on her skin.

If I concentrate hard enough, I find that I can still see it.
