<h1>Venus Under the Gemini Moon</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alithea.html">Alithea</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Somehow it seemed the opposite of everything else that had happened 
that night. Sitting in the red sporty two-seater and winding through 
the blackest of roads up to the humble estate. She watched as the 
driver precariously shifted gears, taking no care of what was ahead. 
The silence of the drive was like the chill of the wind whipping past 
her, dangerous&#133;almost deadly. And even if the dance floor had proved 
nothing she had her grip tight in reason one of the reasons. The dark 
eyes of the driver moved over her briefly, perhaps summing her up even 
more&#133;perhaps gripping tightly to her own reason. It was hard to tell. 
As the car settled into the drive, she noted the family crest hanging 
on the post. She quirked an eyebrow, chiding herself for forgetting her 
host was an aristocrat. It was easy to forget looking at the older 
woman. Easy because for all her elegance she had the cold fog of a 
soldier around her. Dorothy stepped out of the car and walked closely 
with the older woman to the house. Entering it, she noticed how 
unbelievably quaint it was, small, antiques cluttering the front room, 
a long entryway that shot off into various other rooms, polite 
staircase just before the kitchen. She let her host take her light, 
barely necessary jacket and waited for something to spark. 

&#147;Can I get you something to drink&#148;, the older woman asked as she 
wandered into the kitchen.

&#147;Tea would be delightful&#148;; she called. Her deep blue eyes took in the 
whole of the front room as she entered it. It was a little overly 
cluttered but she suspected no one used the room for anything 
important. Two large glass cases held a museum of military decorations 
and medals. A few pictures on the wall gave away very little of who her 
host really was. The picture of Trieze sitting ever so politely on an 
end table was expected&#133;as was the small clutter of pictures of 
Mariemea. Those were the things everyone knew about the woman. She had 
loved Trieze and was the legal guardian of his daughter. It was 
interesting. Her eyes then caught the mementos on the mantelpiece. 
Brushing back her pale blonde hair she stepped over and took a closer 
look. Three glass boxes each with a discarded bullet. &#147;Fascinating&#148;, 
she quirked, slight grin extending on her face. The floor gave a little 
creak and she spun around to meet her host.

&#147;Enjoying the gallery?&#148; The question hit the air with noticeable 
contempt. 

&#147;Oh yes&#148;, she replied. &#147;I nearly had forgotten what an accomplished 
soldier you were. But tell me...&#148;; she paused inching closer. &#147;Why keep 
the bullets?&#148;

&#147;Because they serve as lesson&#146;s.&#148; Almost a cold response, but there was 
a hint of warmth deep within her brown eyes. &#147;One tells of death&#133;one of 
great folly-&#147;

&#147;And the third?&#148;

&#147;Was not meant for me.&#148;

Dorothy nodded, just as the kettle in the kitchen began to sing. 

Une moved stealthily to the other room, noting the way her guest 
gracefully followed. Reaching the stove she brought the steaming kettle 
over to two delicate teacups that were neatly laid out ready to accept 
the scalding liquid. When she finished pouring she began to dip her 
teabag in and out of the cup, noting that her guest just let hers 
settle. 

&#147;Sugar&#148;, a soft and chilled tone asked.

&#147;Just one.&#148;

She pushed the sugar bowl over lightly, took a small spoon of sugar and 
ushered it into Dorothy&#146;s cup. &#147;Cream?&#148;

&#147;No thank you...&#148;

It&#146;s just a game
It&#146;s just a sport
Isn&#146;t it?
Isn&#146;t it?
It&#146;s just killing time
Just something before the storm
Isn&#146;t it?
Isn&#146;t it?
I half suspect to be torn in two
I half suspect I&#146;ll be mauled
Devoured
Discarded
Left without a trace
But it&#146;s just silence
It&#146;s just waiting
Isn&#146;t it?
Isn&#146;t it?

They sat at the kitchen table. Not a word passing between them, just 
slight sighs here and there as a pair of brown or blue eyes moved over 
the other. Watching the way tea was sipped; a cup placed&#133;it was a slow 
dance. Finally it was broken as the young woman placed her cup down a 
wolfish grin on her porcelain face.

&#147;Refresh my memory&#148;, Dorothy began. &#147;Is it Lady Colonel or Colonel 
Lady?&#148;

She smiled a real, genuine smile. &#147;Neither&#133;I&#146;m not a Colonel any 
longer.&#148;

&#147;Ah! So your just a Lady?&#148;

&#147;Just barely&#148;, was the quick reply. &#147;The aristocracy is dead. The 
tittle only remains because no one wants to take it away. Don&#146;t you 
bare a similar title? If I recall correctly your Grandfather was a 
duke.&#148;

&#147;I never carried a tittle. Not that I care to be known by one.&#148; An 
eyebrow sprang up. &#147;Although, Duchess Catalonia has a nice ring to it.&#148;

A slight chuckle left her lips. She brought her cup up and sipped the 
last drops of her tea. Ready for the quickened pulse of the early 
evening to return. Knowing the game, what was left of it, would soon 
return. Dorothy hit her cue perfectly.

&#147;So what does an ex-colonel do these days to keep herself busy?&#148; The 
question hit with superb accuracy.

Hazelnut eyes shut briefly opening with a chill, small grin over her 
mouth. &#147;I make sure nothing happens to make me a colonel again. What 
does a girl of privilege and wealth do?&#148;

&#147;Gives generously to charities, listens to politicians drone one about 
new laws&#133;final campaigns&#133;&#148;, she took in a breath to add speed to her 
next remark. &#147;I also help finance a very secret but necessary group of 
ex-soldiers who keep the world at peace.&#148; 

Silence again, tumbling over and bringing rhythm to the dance. Broken 
once more on cue, perfection in a question.

&#147;What does an aristocratic lady do for fun these days?&#148;  She picked up 
her cup sipping away the last of the now lukewarm drink.

&#147;Isn&#146;t it obvious&#148;, Une set her gaze in deep. &#147;I go to pulsing night 
clubs and hunt for gods and little girls.&#148;

Her grin slid from wolfish to predatory in a heartbeat, knowing full 
well which she was regarded as. &#147;What about princesses&#133;ever hunt for 
them?&#148;

I need to know
I need to feel that spark
That thing that took her
Took her from my heart

&#147;Never royalty&#148;, she quipped. &#147;Tell me&#133;what do goddesses do for fun?&#148;

She sat back into her chair, politely crossing her legs, an eyebrow 
ready to arch. &#147;They play with hearts who dare to challenge them&#133;Listen 
to the worshipers prayers and turn a deaf ear.&#148;

&#147;Ever mistake a prayer for a challenge?&#148;

I need to know
I need to see
That thing that made her run 
From you to me only to leave
And return back to your sea

&#147;Almost&#133;Ever mistake a little girl for a god?&#148;

She stood and gathered the teacups. Walking over to the sink she 
replied, &#147;Almost.&#148;  

The cups hit the tile with a light click. She brushed away her brown 
hair and looked at the clock. &#147;It&#146;s getting late.&#148;

&#147;Is it?&#148; She walked over to the hunter, nearly staring her down. 

&#147;Nearly three&#133;how are you planning on getting home?&#148;

&#147;I wasn&#146;t planning on making it back at all&#148;, she replied, and stepped 
closer. Her prey did not even flinch. &#147;You hurt her you know&#133;that 
little girl you nearly mistook for a god.&#148;

Une shook her head and stepped away. Remembering the chill of ending a 
relationship that never moved from the ground. The sting of pulling the 
pistol from the girl&#146;s hand as she begged&#133;begged for freedom. &#147;She 
wanted to be hurt. Wanted release&#133;she still does. But you and I&#133;we 
refuse to give it to her&#148;, she nearly choked out. &#147;She didn&#146;t want 
anything I had to offer&#133;and I never let her race back to me. She did 
not love me.&#148; her voice was solid ice.

&#147;You seem convinced the princess loved the goddess.&#148;

&#147;She did.&#148;

&#147;But she left me, Une. She left for you.&#148; Dorothy inched closer, 
destroying the game, vying for a challenge instead. 

&#147;It doesn&#146;t change how she really felt&#148;, Une stated coolly. &#147;It doesn&#146;t 
change that she returned.&#148;

&#147;It didn&#146;t last.&#148;

Those light brown eyes were alight with something not really 
recognizable; maybe it was hurt&#133;or even concern. Dorothy wasn&#146;t sure. 
She watched the older woman carefully as she stepped to the challenge.

Here in the dark
Nothing makes sense
I need the daylight
Won&#146;t you lead me to it
Won&#146;t you tell me where it is
Here in the dark
Lost in these dreams
Nothing is right
If I become your heaven
Will you show me the way
Will you show me what warmth is
Leave me in the daylight

&#147;Why are we doing this?&#148; it was asked so lightly the goddess could have 
sworn another soul had entered the room. &#147;Why are you still trying to 
force the game&#133;make a challenge... force a fight? You won Dorothy. In 
the end it was always you&#133; and you won. She needed the divine&#133;but as 
things have it she didn&#146;t know what that meant.&#148;

She wanted to applaud. She really did want to clap and set in like she 
would have with her princess, but the way the words hit her&#133;They were 
so sincere. Une was conceding, not because she didn&#146;t have the 
artillery to win but because she had already lost. The lady&#146;s eyes were 
still flickering with something unrecognizable, something that seemed 
to burn deep and refused to be extinguished. The older woman leaned up 
against the counter, her eyes shut for half a moment. So the goddess 
moved closer, needing to reveal what it was the hunter was trying to 
hide. 

She felt her guest getting closer. Moving in ready to kill or seduce 
but it didn&#146;t matter which it was. &#147;What more do you need to know?&#148;  

The goddess was extraordinarily close now, closer than she had been on 
the dance floor, pushing her weight forward...daring expecting danger. 
Her lips whispering at the lady&#146;s ear, &#147;What&#146;s your name?&#148;

Une leaned in a silent word slipping from her lips caressing her 
guest&#146;s ear. 

She dared
Dared to listen
Dared to ask
Dared to take
And she takes
Takes without question
Without permission
She dares
Dares to want
Dares to claim
Dares to steal
And she steals
Steals this heart
Without permission
Who is she to dare
To claim and take
Whatever&#133;whenever
She feels
She loses
She gains
She needs
She dares
Dares to challenge
And she challenges me

It was strange how it happened. It was nearly unexpected even though 
that&#146;s where she wanted things to go. Even though it was what she 
craved, she didn&#146;t think she would get it. But those eyes&#133;those light 
brown almost frozen, hard eyes were sparking. They were calling and 
speaking in a tone she wasn&#146;t used to, and maybe this isn&#146;t what they 
wanted. But she didn&#146;t know the language so she just guessed. She 
claimed the lady&#146;s soft lips with her own&#133;pushing lightly&#133; almost 
asking&#133; what was next. Arms pulled her close taking things deeper and 
the goddess only came up for air once to whisper a name that no one 
else seemed to know. As if it were a curse or a sacred prayer&#133;something 
that only the divine could learn or speak without being struck down. 
Then the pulse, that long dead call, began again, like music only 
grander, like dancing only terribly still. It was frightening not being 
able to move, but still somehow pushing. Pushing the sky to move 
outward, stars to expand, commanding that the universe obey...because 
she had the power. And she wanted to share it, wanted the elegant 
mortal in her grasp&#133;who was moving fingers through her hair&#133;pulling her 
closer&#133;urging her to take more&#133;She wanted her captive to move the stars 
back with her. And it was odd&#133;odd and strangely comfortable because she 
realized&#133;and quickly that she was the one being held prisoner. She was 
the one being asked to join the ranks of heaven. She was being pulled 
in as she pushed. She&#146;d never let go of so much control, even while 
waxing submissive she always held the reigns&#133;but now it was all gone. 
She was still strong, still held her power but for once it didn&#146;t 
matter that it wasn&#146;t hers to control. 

I told you
Whispered it
This is not a game
I am not a sport
I&#146;m something else
Something different
Something that lingers
Leaves
Wishes
Wanders
I make them all feel
Just how they need
Make them all see
They are part of me
And when it over takes your heart
Settles in the dust
You&#146;ll wonder why
You never dared to take too much

She was never happier waking in such a way. Fingers pulsing down her 
back, brushing through her hair, asking gently for her to wake up. She 
hugged the body beneath her tightly. It made sense, being there just 
made perfect sense. She couldn&#146;t claim love, but she never even tried. 
She just knew things were building. Things were just starting. And 
somehow everything would come together like it was supposed to.
