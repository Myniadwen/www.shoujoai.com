<h1>Failure of Vision (part 6 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rzrblade.html">Rzrblade33</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gundam/failure-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>It is almost like a war. A war between Duo and Relena over Heero. At 
least, that&#146;s how it started. 

Now Relena believes that she lost Heero long ago. She still can&#146;t 
comprehend that she never had him in the first place.

And Duo - being the compassionate person that he is - is rubbing it in 
her face. He hangs all over Heero, always maintaining physical contact 
and choosing the ideal moments to engage the Perfect Soldier in a 
deep, soul searching kiss.

I used to believe that Heero was oblivious to the war raging around 
him. I realize now that it&#146;s quite the opposite. He&#146;s igniting it, 
keeping it sustained. He runs his hand along Duo&#146;s thigh. He plays 
with Duo&#146;s braid only when he&#146;s sure that she can see it. Yet he 
allows her to pull him on the little leash she pretends that she has 
attached to his neck. I don&#146;t know his exact reasons. I suspect that 
he&#146;s like me; he infinitely enjoys seeing Relena suffer. But I can&#146;t 
be sure. He&#146;s so hard to read sometimes.

I can hear them at night - Duo and Heero, that is. And I know that she 
can hear them as well. I&#146;ve never heard more screaming - orgasmic or 
other - in my life. I sometimes think that Duo has to be faking it, 
forcing it.

But he&#146;s not. I can tell that it&#146;s entirely real. They&#146;re just not 
holding anything back. There&#146;s a genuine ring when they both scream, 
&#147;I love you&#148; within seconds of each other.

And I think it&#146;s the genuineness of it that breaks Miss Relena&#146;s 
heart. And sends her into my room, to prove to Duo - and maybe even 
herself - that she really doesn&#146;t need Heero.

So she slips into my room after the session down the hall is over and 
all is relatively quiet. She is crying and shaking, although trying to 
pretend as though she isn&#146;t. She throws her legs around me, entangles 
her fingers in my hair, kisses me deeply, and tells me that she needs 
me. I normally tell her that I know and welcome her persistent hands. 
Then it&#146;s quick and fast, just as I like it, and I wish that Duo would 
never leave. Relena screams extremely loudly, but that&#146;s no change 
from usual.

Except now there is someone else to hear her.

Things are different tonight, however. She&#146;s not so impatient. Her 
hands aren&#146;t so hurried. She isn&#146;t bawling as she normally is, but her 
eyes are red and puffy so I know that she has been.

I wish that she would have waited until she was with me. I wonder if 
maybe that was why she stopped so early tonight, because she realized 
that her tears thrill me. I wonder if maybe she has finally figured it 
all out, this game we play.

&#147;You taste like blood,&#148; she tells me. &#147;You always taste like blood. 
Why is that?&#148; She kisses my thigh so tenderly that I want to push her 
away. She&#146;s not supposed to be this gentle. Our nights weren&#146;t 
supposed to change.

&#147;I don&#146;t know.&#148; I scrape my nails across her arm and relish the red 
marks I make on her pretty white skin.

&#147;Hm.&#148; She kisses me and digs her own nails into my hip.

She&#146;s learned to fight back. I admit that I&#146;m impressed. And a little 
excited.

&#147;We&#146;re going to kill each other,&#148; I murmur as she begins to move 
against me. I know that this means she longs for intimacy, when she 
doesn&#146;t want to bother with fingers or tongues. She wants to be as 
close as possible so that she can delude herself into believing we 
have something that even remotely resembles a loving relationship.

She builds her life around those delusions sometimes. I adore watching 
them shatter.

&#147;Perhaps.&#148; A strangled moan escapes her throat as she moves faster. 
&#147;But I don&#146;t mind.&#148;

Our gazes meet, and I can see that she&#146;s close. Her skin is flushed 
and her eyes are clouded and faraway. Blood drips from our entwined 
hands from nails sinking into skin, although I don&#146;t know which of us 
is bleeding.

&#147;At least I&#146;ll die with you,&#148; she continues, throwing her head back. 
&#147;And not Heero.&#148;

Her body begins to shudder, and I follow moments after, holding her 
close, feeling everything around me crash and burn. Her words echo in 
my mind. Not Heero.

It is almost like a war. Wars are beautiful.

And so utterly complicated.
