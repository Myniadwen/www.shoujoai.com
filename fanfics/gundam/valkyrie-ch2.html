<a href="../gundam/valkyrie-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>	&quot;Heero!!!&quot;

	Relena gasped, struggling for breath as she flailed out, trying to
keep her precarious hold on the ground, knew she hanging inches above
disaster. Horrified, she realized that there was no steady surface to grab
on to, that she could not stop herself from being sucked under.  She
desperately clawed forward, but the ground was a slippery substance that
kept sliding out from under her hands, even as she strained forward,
muscles aching with fatigue.

	&quot;Heero!!!&quot;
	
Relena screamed again, knowing he could hear her, that somewhere in the
darkness that surrounded her, he was there.  Certainly, he would help her,
when she needed him now, desperately.  Surely, he would be there for her
when she needed him the most.

	&quot;Heero!!! Please!!!&quot;
	
Relena could feel her arms tiring, all her muscles ready to burst with the
pain, but she refused to give in.
	
//He&#39;ll be here, he&#39;ll help me, I know it...//

	Compelled by some inner voice, Relena looked up, and saw that
Heero was actually standing right over her, watching expressionlessly as
she held on for dear life.

	&quot;Heero, please!&quot; she gasped, &quot;Help me, I&#39;m falling.&quot;
	
The brown-haired pilot watched her, his face impassive and expressionless,
dark eyes completely blank, with neither affection nor hatred.

	&quot;Heero?&quot;
	
Relena could feel herself slipping, her last desperate hold failing, but
that didn&#39;t terrify her at all, not compared to the void in Heero&#39;s eyes. 
She shook her head in horrified disbelief as all at once, he simply turned
and walked away, disappearing back into the darkness.

	&quot;Heero!!  No!!! Don&#39;t leave me!! Please!!!&quot;
	
/ &quot;Relena.&quot;/
	
&quot;Heero!!&quot;
	
Relena&#39;s hands were free, the ground beneath them had finally given way,
and she was clawing wildly for a grip in open air, falling helplessly into
an endless abyss.
	
/ &quot;Relena!&quot; /

&quot;Heero!!  Help me!!!&quot;

	Relena stretched her arm out in a useless final gesture, falling
backward through the endless, endless darkness that would quickly erase
any memory of her.  It wouldn&#39;t make much difference, if she had ever
lived at all.

	&quot;Relena!  Wake up!&quot;
	
Relena blinked, gasping for air that was now real and cold in her lungs. 
In contrast, warm hands were holding her shoulders in a firm but gentle
grip, shaking her slightly, severing her completely from the nightmare.  A
tight embrace pulled her back into the real world, and she shivered
uncontrollably, fear still racing through her body, setting all her senses
on edge.

	&quot;It&#39;s all right, it&#39;s all right.  It was only a dream.&quot;
	
Relena bent forward into the warm embrace, trying to hold back a sob of
almost childish terror.  Her hand lifted of it&#39;s own accord, closing
gently around a long, thick rope of blonde hair.
	
//Blonde hair?//

Relena blinked again, looking up into Dorothy&#39;s blue eyes.
	
&quot;Dorothy!  I... I just...&quot;
	
&quot;You had a nightmare, I think.	I passed by your door and heard you cry
out.&quot;
	
&quot;Yes, I...&quot;
  
Relena shuddered, unable to brush off the feeling of helplessness from the
horrible dream, of reaching out and realizing that no one would reach
back.  

//No matter how frightened, how desperate I was, I was completely on my
own.  And I couldn&#39;t do it, not on my own.  I didn&#39;t survive.//
	
Still holding her tightly, Dorothy&#39;s hand started to make slow, steady
circles against her back. For a moment, Relena didn&#39;t know what to think,
but that confusion soon passed into a contented, peaceful calm.  

	  //This is all right.	Girls can do this for each other, it&#39;s not
like Dorothy&#39;s a boy or anything.//

	Relena blushed slightly, both at the other girl&#39;s closeness and
her own suddenly... /detailed/ thoughts about that closeness.  Just
because Dorothy wasn&#39;t a boy, just because no one else might see anything
wrong with it didn&#39;t mean Relena couldn&#39;t still think things... absurdly
embarrassing things.
	
//Quit it.  Do you /want/ her to think you&#39;re some kind of freak?!  She
hates you, anyway.  You know that.//

Relena knew she should have probably been ashamed, that Dorothy&#39;s innocent
touch could make her fantasize like some twittering airhead, but it really
was... the first time anyone had ever... even touched her like this,
before.
  
The girl knew she had led a fairly sheltered life, basically walled away
from the rest of the world since she had been born.  She had never been
kissed or held closely by anyone before.

No one had told her they loved her.

Dorothy&#39;s hand on her shoulder, the blonde girl&#39;s embrace was the most
intimate contact Relena had known, the most physical affection she had
been shown in a long, long time.

	//Even my family wasn&#39;t affectionate... we didn&#39;t hug or kiss
much.  They were all kind, of course, but stoic. Very stoic.//

	Relena didn&#39;t have the heart to think about life after that, and
her current life, the person she became after her father&#39;s death.

	//I have to be all business...I can&#39;t think about anything else,
except what I have to do, or I&#39;ll fail everyone.  Other things don&#39;t
matter.  Not now.//

	&quot;You&#39;ve been working very hard, Relena.&quot;  

Dorothy seemed to be reading her thoughts, still gently stroking her back,
not moving away even though Relena was calmer now.  Was it just her
imagination, or was the blonde girl teasing at her hair slightly, letting
it slide through her fingers just a little too slowly?
	
//You&#39;re tired, Relena.  Very, very tired.  None of this would be going
through your head if you weren&#39;t.  Just give it a rest.//
	
&quot;It&#39;s my responsibility, Dorothy... it&#39;s very important that I uphold the
Absolute Pacifism way of... that ...&quot; 

Relena blinked, losing the rest of the thought, and let her head fall, to
rest on Dorothy&#39;s shoulder.
   
	&quot;Oh... hell with it.  Can we just quit the act? Call a truce? 
Just for tonight?&quot;

	Dorothy&#39;s eyes widened in surprise.

	&quot;Act?&quot;

	Relena sighed.

	&quot;The endless games... the barbs we throw at each other that no one
else sees, the comments that simmer under the surface...  The fact that
neither one of us likes each other very much.&quot;	Relena looked up into
Dorothy&#39;s blue gaze and was not surprised to see a sly understanding
there.

&quot;I know you know what I mean, Dorothy.&quot;

The blonde girl only smiled.

&quot;I was having fun.  Weren&#39;t you?&quot;

Relena closed her eyes, swallowing hard as a swirl of emotions she was too
exhausted to even consider slammed into her all at once.

&quot;I... yeah.  But... I... I... I just... I&quot;
 
Relena choked back a sob, but the tears came despite her best efforts to
stop them.

//Don&#39;t cry.  You weren&#39;t kidding when you said she didn&#39;t like you, you
know she&#39;s not who she seems to be.  For god sakes, Relena, /don&#39;t/ cry in
front of her.//

 Relena moved away from the blonde girl, quickly wiping her eyes, doing
her best not to break down completely.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Dorothy.  I&#39;m just very, very tired...&quot;  

Relena felt a pang of exasperated anger, as tears continued to flow around
her fingertips, despite her best attempts to remain calm.  The anger only
made things worse, mixing with vague but overwhelming disappointment, and
that ever-present nagging voice, that she could never do the job she
promised she could do, that everything she worked for, all she believed
in, was doomed to failure.

That /she/ would fail, where her father would have succeeded.  That Relena
Peacecraft would fall hard from her throne, and take everyone else with
her.

//Damn it!  Damn it! /Damn it!/

&quot;It&#39;s all right, Relena.  I know what you&#39;re going through.&quot;

Relena blinked at the soft tone in Dorothy&#39;s voice, a husky half-whisper
she had never heard before, and looked up into the other girl&#39;s face.  

&quot;Dorothy... what?&quot;
	
The girl&#39;s blue eyes trapped her gaze, wrapping her in a soft blanket of
understanding, honest and true admiration... and maybe... just maybe..?

	//Yeah, right.	Dorothy has always mocked me, always and /only/
mocked me.  She never thought I was worth anything, and that Absolute
Pacifism was more than a silly pipe dream.//  

Relena smiled despite herself.	

//Not that we didn&#39;t have some great arguments about that...//

	&quot;It&#39;s fun to disguise our disagreements, Relena. To hide behind
kind words and smiles, and argue politely in the spaces between... it&#39;s
almost like our own secret code.&quot;  

Relena almost jumped, as once again, Dorothy seemed to know exactly what
she was thinking.
  
&quot;You&#39;ve risen to meet my challenge every time, Relena, no matter what. 
You&#39;re the only person who&#39;s returned to play my game, and you play it
with such grace and style... a talent all your own.&quot;
	
Relena didn&#39;t know how to answer, still completely confused by the
emotions she was seeing in the girl&#39;s hazy blue eyes, an almost perfect
counterpoint to her half-cynical tone.	

//It isn&#39;t real...it couldn&#39;t be real.// 

Disdainful taunting hidden behind compliment, an ironic, false concern,
all consumed by the belief so strong it was almost fact that Relena was
doomed to fail...

//... and an idiot for even making the attempt//

That was the Dorothy she knew.	Not this, not this caring, not this
kindness.  Relena laughed once, a sharp, bitter bark that hung in the air
as she shook her head almost angrily.

	&quot;This is a joke, this kindness.  You, you... this is some sort of
trick.	This is some sort of stupid, political trick.&quot;

	Relena was only dully interested in that realization, too tired to
even care much what the other girl would do to her now, now that she had
said the words that had hung between them for so long.	Any emotion that
wasn&#39;t consumed by weariness fell to sudden, bitter disappointment, and
Relena realized she didn&#39;t really know why she was so upset.  The
brown-haired girl knew she was right, knew Dorothy had to be playing some
sort of political game... but she /really/ didn&#39;t want to be right.

	//Is it so wrong for me to want something, to want someone? 
Someone I can confide in...someone I can love, just for me. That I could
work just for what we want, our future, and not anything else.	A life
apart from Absolute Pacifism, apart from all the politics?  Someone who
will love me back...is that so much to ask for??//

	The tears were coming again, but before she could wipe them away,
Dorothy&#39;s hands were there, gently brushing them aside, and Relena once
again found herself back in the blonde girl&#39;s embrace.

	&quot;Stupid... such a stupid joke.&quot; Relena choked out between sobs.
	
&quot;They&#39;re the jokes, Relena.&quot;
	
Dorothy half-stood, moving around the perimeter of the bed until she was
resting with her back against the headboard, and the brown-haired girl was
snugly wrapped in her arms.  Relena could hear Dorothy&#39;s heart beat from
where her head rested on the other girl&#39;s chest, that pale skin only
divided from her touch by the sheerest of fabrics. 
	
Dorothy held her gently, one hand reaching up from time to time, to trace
the curve of the brown-haired girl&#39;s ear with a fingertip, drawing an
imaginary line from her cheekbone to her chin, twining a few strands of
brown hair between her fingers.  Relena didn&#39;t know what to think, and so
she didn&#39;t think anything at all.
	
//I&#39;m still dreaming.  I must be dreaming...//
	
It was a long time until Dorothy spoke again, her words were bitter, and
seethed with anger.
	
&quot;All of them are idiots.  They have eyes, just like I do.  They watch you
closely enough, they can see what goes on, what you have to deal with. 
But do they care what they&#39;re doing to you?  None of them think twice...
they&#39;re all like children, little boys with giant toys.  Even Lieutenant
Noin.  More than willing to go out, to slash and burn and kill without any
discrimination, while you stand by to try and explain their destruction to
people who only want vengeance.&quot;

	The blonde chuckled, a cool, gravelly sound that sent a shiver
down Relena&#39;s spine.
	
&quot;It sounds so insane, even for me... but I know I&#39;m really the only one
who sees it.  I&#39;m the only one who thinks there&#39;s something wrong with the
Queen of the World.&quot;

	Dorothy was smoothing Relena&#39;s hair as she spoke, rubbing her
temples with the gentlest touch.  The brown-haired girl soon found that it
was impossible to stay awake, no matter how much she wanted to hear what
Dorothy was saying.  The words simply refused to make sense, all blurring
together into a softly-spoken lullaby.

	&quot;Something&#39;s got to be done... because this is the first time...
really the first time... I ever cared.&quot;
  
Dorothy paused, and when she spoke again her voice was barely a whisper,
her breath tickling against the brown-haired girl&#39;s face, as if she were
speaking directly in Relena&#39;s ear, the words speeding right to her heart. 
They still didn&#39;t make sense, Relena was too tired to understand, but it
felt as if the other girl were giving her some important secret, and that
trust made her glow inside.

	&quot;You want to know why we differ, Relena?  It&#39;s simple, really.	 I
think that, for Absolute Pacifism to work, someone&#39;s got to be the martyr.
At the very beginning, someone&#39;s got to be willing to sacrifice everything
for the peace of the world.   I think that everyone here, has already
decided... decided for you before you ever had the chance, that you&#39;re the
one who has to lose.  You&#39;ve got to suffer, so that they can all be
happy.&quot;

	Distantly, Relena felt arms tighten protectively around her.

	&quot;And I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m going to let that happen...&quot;

	&quot;Relena!  Miss Relena!!!&quot;

	Relena jumped from Dorothy&#39;s arms as if she were spring-loaded,
leaping to her feet and scrambling to the door before she was even
partially awake, reacting almost instinctively to the sound of panic.  She
opened the door, just a crack, to see a soldier standing, wide-eyed and
panicked in the hallway.

	&quot;What?	What is it?&quot;

	&quot;We&#39;ve got problems, ma&#39;am.&quot;

	&quot;What kind of problems?&quot;

	Relena&#39;s question was answered by a large explosion somewhere
overhead, and the sound of people yelling orders down the hall.

	In less than a minute, Dorothy found herself in a cold, empty
bedroom, with the lights off and the door locked.  Relena hadn&#39;t looked at
the blonde once as she quickly dressed and ran out the door, already too
busy trying to think of ways to talk her way out of one more crisis for
the Sank kingdom.
