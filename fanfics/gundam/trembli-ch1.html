<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kimmie.html">Kimmie</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I can&#39;t believe she shot me! Who does she think she is? Stupid peace- 
loving miscreant Sanc trash, just like that imbecilic Zechs Marquise! 

She shot at me... completely demolished the rose that I wore to honor 
Treize. Yet, she&#39;s supposed to be a pacifist. What kind of pacifist 
knows how to shoot a gun? Then again, it makes me wonder why she only 
hit that silly rose. I was three measly feet away from her, and she 
missed. I suppose I should be glad. After all, it&#39;s not every day that a 
woman like me escapes what could have been death at the hands of a cute 
girl.

Oh no... don&#39;t tell me I just thought that! She&#39;s not cute... Okay, I 
can&#39;t lie to myself. She&#39;s interesting, if nothing else. There&#39;s just 
something about her... Relena Peacecraft... It&#39;s a name as intricate as 
she is. It won&#39;t roll off your tongue, but it will stick in your mind.

I wonder what would happen if I approached her again. Oh my... I know 
where I&#39;ve seen her before. Her father... Step-father? Dorlian... 
Whatever happened, I screwed up her life, didn&#39;t I? That would be why 
that gun was pointed in my direction. But, why did she miss? That 
question will be bugging me forever. I want to find out. I want to 
approach her, and question her, and kiss her, and...

No! I have to stop thinking about her like this! I have feelings for 
Treize, and no one else. Not pretty girls who can&#39;t kill me, not anyone.

But, it makes me want to ask if she didn&#39;t shoot me because she has 
feelings for me. Of course, that&#39;s crazy, and I probably am too. After 
all, Treize treats me like a pesky little sister. You can&#39;t fall in love 
with someone who treats you like a sister unless you&#39;ve got problems. 
Perhaps... Hmm... If I approached her... and apologized... and gave her 
the option of trying to shoot me again, what would happen? I truly am 
curious. After all, I&#39;m not exactly the fluffiest of people. But, 
someone could love me... at least, I hope so.

Right now, I want nothing more than to steal back to where she is, and 
pull her off somewhere to talk. But, I suppose I&#39;ll have to make due 
with a nice bath back at the hotel. I took some of Treize&#39;s bubble 
bath... Then again, perhaps I&#39;ll stop somewhere on the way and buy some 
different bubble bath... Something... pink. Maybe something 
strawberry... or that vanilla I saw while buying Treize his...

Perhaps tonight was a good thing. I&#39;ve been under the firm delusion for 
years now that Treize is always right, and can do no wrong. But, I took 
it too far. His political ideals are all that I should be upholding and 
striving for, not him. Treize is but my commanding officer. It&#39;s like 
attempting to find love with my boss.

I remember saying several years ago that if I ever got like this, 
someone should shoot me. Perhaps this was only a warning shot telling me 
to cast off Treize and all of his silly roses before it becomes too 
late. Perhaps I should move on.

After all, she is sort of cute in that firm devotional way of hers... 
Besides, we&#39;re fighting a war here. From what I&#39;ve heard, it&#39;s better to 
have someone to fight for. Perhaps I can fight for her... Perhaps... 
Perhaps I&#39;m crazy, or maybe I&#39;m just falling for the enemy. Hmm... at 
least I have just cause.
