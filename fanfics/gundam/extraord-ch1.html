<h1>Extraordinary</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/draco.html">Draco</a><br> </h2>
<pre>There is nothing extraordinary about me. Oh I have got plenty of 
confidence. I know I&#39;m a good body guard. And no one has ever 
defeated me in artillery and marksmanship. But those things are 
temporary. With time and the decay of my own body those will change 
and wilt. Take away the military training and all you would have 
left is an ordinary nineteen year old girl. A girl who is a bit shy 
in front of crowds. A girl who hasn&#39;t quite gotten use to her own 
body and sometimes moves awkwardly about the place. A girl who is in 
love with the most extraordinary person in the whole world. And the 
most extraordinary thing of all is that she loves me back.

I pinch myself hard. I do that every so often to assure myself that 
this isn&#39;t all a fantasy, some illusion I created around my mind.

Staring at my reflection in the mirror I can&#39;t help but smile 
stupidly at myself. Perhaps there is a God after all. 

I splash some water on my face as I get ready for my day. As I walk 
out of my bathroom, my bedroom door opens as Relena steps in. Her 
face is slightly pale from fatigue, and small circles form around her 
eyes. Yet as our eyes meet, her face melt into a smile, &quot;Morning, 
Hilde.&quot; And I melt in to the ground. She has that effect on me. 
It&#39;s very inconvenient.

&quot;Still having trouble sleeping?&quot; I ask as I motion for her to sit on 
my bed.

&quot;Who told you I was having trouble sleeping?&quot; Relena looks at me 
sharply as she seats herself on my bed. 

&quot;No one. I camp out in the tree outside your window every night and 
watch you,&quot; I tell her straight faced as I begin to massage her back.

&quot;And do you like what you see?&quot; Relena batters her eyelashes at me 
dramatically and I break out in to a fit of laughter, but inside I am 
stupidly warm and fuzzy.

&quot;Very much,&quot; I kiss her neck gently. We are taking it slow. Very 
slow. But it really doesn&#39;t matter. We are not Heero and Duo. or 
Quatre and Trowa for that matter. Not that I mind. Nope, not at 
all. I breathe in the smell of lilac in her hair.

&quot;Stop that, or else I&#39;m going to miss the morning meeting,&quot; Relena 
gently pushes me away.

&quot;Remember our date tonight?&quot; I ask as I jump up from the bed.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Relena straightens her hair in one motion, &quot;Do I ever 
forget?&quot;

&quot;You could tell me what we are doing,&quot; I beg her softly.

&quot;It&#39;s a surprise!&quot; She laughs as she walks out the door. I follow 
behind her stealing one last sniff at her before walking a foot 
behind her.

When I arrive at the conference room, I knew something was wrong. 
Lady Une&#39;s face is unusually mute, and Tyr Marison is shifting 
uncomfortably in his chair. 

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Relena asks immediately, &quot;Did the talks with L4 
collapse over night?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Lady Une looked as if she didn&#39;t know how to proceed. A rare 
occasion for her.

&quot;Here,&quot; Tyr Marison slams down the morning report in front of us.

My heart skips a beat. It&#39;s a picture of Relena and I kissing.

&quot;Vice Foreign Minister Having Affair With Female Bodyguard&quot;

My eyes fly to Relena. Her face seems a shade paler than they were a 
moment ago, but she is silent. I suddenly get the urge to laugh. 
God, that frontline makes it sound cheap. The best thing that has 
ever happened to me is cheapened to one line. Female bodyguard. 
God, they had to point that out.

&quot;They didn&#39;t get your good side,&quot; Relena finally speaks.

&quot;If they wanted a picture of us, they should have asked,&quot; Relena 
walks towards Lady Une, &quot;Does the Preventer council feel that I need 
a press conference to address this?&quot;

&quot;They only want you to confirm or deny it,&quot; Tyr Marison answers for 
Lady Une.

&quot;It&#39;s none of their.&quot; I object, but Relena silences me with her eyes.

&quot;Confirm it,&quot; Relena says simply.

&quot;Relena.&quot; Lady Une begins but isn&#39;t sure how to finish.

&quot;How much will it damage my image to the colonies?&quot; Relena asks, but 
she isn&#39;t expecting an answer, &quot;My credibility and my ability is not 
based on my celibacy nor some virginal image of the daughter of the 
Peacecrafts.&quot;

God, in her one sentence, my heart leaped to my mouth, and in the 
same breath she grounded me. I place one of my hand over my other 
hand to prevent it from shaking.

&quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; Tyr Marison suddenly looks uncertain of 
himself, &quot;Three years ago perhaps the world saw Relena as nothing 
more than her family. But her work in the past three years have 
proved otherwise.&quot;

I want to hug him!

&quot;But as the situation stands, it is unprofessional for Relena to have 
a relationship with her bodyguard,&quot; Tyr Marison continued, &quot;I think 
Hilde need to be transferred.&quot;

I want to smack him. hard!

&quot;The Preventers are willing to offer Hilde positions as either an 
active agent or a trainer,&quot; Lady Une remedies.

Active agent. that means.

&quot;You will remain here, of course, &quot;Lady Une explains to me 
carefully, &quot;But another bodyguard will be appointed.&quot;

&quot;Can I have sometime to think about this?&quot; I am good at handling 
tough situation, but this. this is happening too fast. 

Lady Une nods.

&quot;Give me an update on the situation at L4. The video conference is 
in ten minutes,&quot; Relena starts to take out her files, but for a 
moment her eyes meets mine and her steady gaze assures me that she is 
alright.

&quot;We have the support of the Winners of course, but the Mining 
Coalition is still hesitant about the transfer.&quot; Tyr Marison updates 
Relena on the situation.

I start to tone out of their conversation. Active agent. There are 
only five active agents working for the Preventers. the five gundam 
pilots. Lady Une is giving me a chance to prove myself. to prove 
that I am as good as any of them without their gundams. God, three 
years ago I would have killed for this opportunity. but now. Damn 
it. just when my life was going so well. Well, at least I know being 
Relena&#39;s bodyguard is definitely out of the question. Lady Une 
offered me two jobs. in other words, my only options if I wish to 
remain here.

One of the advantages of being in a dilemma is that time flies by 
very quickly. I find myself at the end of the day with no easy 
solution.

&quot;You have until tomorrow to tell me your answer,&quot; Lady Une reminds me.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; I tell her gratefully. I know she must have wrestled a 
lot of bureaucrats to even offer me those jobs. 

Lady Une smiles slightly before leaving the conference room. Only 
Relena and I are left. 

&quot;Ready for our date?&quot; Relena asks me. Oh my gosh, I had completely 
forgotten.

&quot;Do you still want to go?&quot; I prompt.

&quot;Only if you promise not to sulk like you have been doing all day,&quot; 
Relena laughs as she pushes me down on a chair and begins to massage 
my shoulders as I had done for her in the morning.

&quot;I am not sulking!&quot; I defend myself.

&quot;Could have fooled me,&quot; She whispers as she nibbles on my ear.

With deadly efficiency, I spin my chair around and pull her into my 
lap. Good to know my training is good for practical things.

Relena laughs in my lap as she tries to push me away, but I secure 
her there tightly.

&quot;What do you think I should do?&quot; I ask her grimly.

&quot;I.&quot; Relena hesitates, &quot;I have been expecting this for a while now.&quot;

&quot;Have you?&quot; I am curious, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you warn me?&quot;

&quot;Because I didn&#39;t want you to stop kissing me just so no one would 
know about us.&quot; I can feel her warm breath on my face.

&quot;Good answer,&quot; I press my nose against her nose. For a long moment 
we just stare at each other, unwilling to let the silence break.

&quot;Now that I can no longer be your bodyguard, which job do you think 
I should take?&quot; I finally ask.

&quot;I thought you really wanted to be an active agent?&quot; Relena eyes me 
questioningly.

&quot;Yes, but that would mean I will be called away on assignments 
often.&quot; I start, but Relena stops me with a kiss. 

&quot;I will survive,&quot; Relena tells me after she had effectively 
eradicated my mind of any rational thought.

&quot;Being an active agent would also mean that I will be put on.&quot;

&quot;Deadly assignments, I know,&quot; Relena finished for me as she cups my 
face with my hand, &quot;And as much as I would love to keep you in some 
gilded cage here as a trainer for cadet, Hilde. I know you would hate 
it. If my infatuation with Heero has taught me anything, it&#39;s that.&quot;

&quot;Relena, I.&quot;

&quot;I love you, Hilde. And I love you enough to risk everything.&quot;

Somehow our lips meet again, and I can not stop kissing her. Breathe 
Hilde, breathe. Dying right now would be terribly inconvenient.

***

&quot;Relena, the ballroom is closed,&quot; I complain to Relena as she drags 
me towards the backdoor of the ballroom.

&quot;I know,&quot; She smiles mysteriously at me as she gets out a key and 
opens the door.

&quot;How did you get that?&quot; I gasp. This was not what I was expecting 
when I started out on this date.

&quot;The manager of Preventer Headquarters is a good friend,&quot; Relena 
answers as she pushes me through the door.

&quot;What are we doing here?&quot; I whisper softly as I step into the oblique 
darkness.

The light flickers on and I find myself in a decorated ballroom. The 
sparkling chandelier glitters softly in the center of the room.

&quot;What is this!&quot; I exclaim as I spin around in the ballroom.

Relena slowly walks towards me, &quot;Do you remember what happened three 
years ago on this date?&quot;

I quickly search my head for some clue to what she was talking about 
when it suddenly hits me.

&quot;Our first dance.&quot; My throat was suddenly dry.

Relena nods as she steps next to me, &quot;That&#39;s when you told me you 
liked me.&quot;

&quot;You remembered.&quot; I&#39;m melting. I know I&#39;m melting. Soon there will 
be nothing left except a puddle of Hilde on the ground.

&quot;Do you remember what else you told me?&quot; Relena asks as she teases me 
with fleeting kisses on my cheeks.

Unable to talk, I nod feebly.

&quot;Have you ever had a moment where you could almost hear the music 
playing the background?&quot; Relena starts as a soft music begins to 
play in the background, &quot;Where it was so dramatic, you can imagine 
all the camera angles just to frame that moment,&quot; Relena whispers my 
own words from three years ago back at me.

&quot;My entire life, I have been on the stage surrounded by cameras,&quot; 
Relena slowly takes me into her arms.

*When it&#39;s love you give (I&#39;ll be a man of good faith)*

&quot;And I was so lonely living on the stage.&quot;

*Then in love you live (I&#39;ll make a stand, I won&#39;t break)*

&quot;Then you walked on to the stage with me.&quot;

*I&#39;ll be the rock you can build on*

&quot;And for the first time in my life, I wasn&#39;t alone in the limelight.&quot;

*Be there when you&#39;re old, to have and to hold*

&quot;All my life, I have been trying to cling on to shadows of security.&quot;

*When there&#39;s love inside (I swear I&#39;ll always be strong)*

&quot;First my father. then Heero. but I couldn&#39;t. in the end I was 
standing here by myself again.&quot;

*Then there&#39;s a reason why (I&#39;ll prove to you we belong)*

&quot;Then you came into my life. and you offered me.&quot;

*I&#39;ll be the wall that protects you
&gt;From the wind and the rain
&gt;From the hurt and pain.*

&quot;Everything.&quot;

*Let&#39;s make it all for one and all for love*

&quot;And you asked for nothing in return.&quot;

*Let the one you hold be the one you want*

&quot;And you gave me so much until.&quot;

*The one you need*

&quot;I woke up one day, and I realized I can&#39;t live without you any more.&quot;

*Cause when it&#39;s all for one it&#39;s one for all*

&quot;I love you.&quot;

*When there&#39;s someone that should know*

&quot;I love you with every breath I take.&quot;

*Then just let your feelings show*

&quot;And nothing will ever change that.&quot;

*And make it all for one and all for love*

I am sobbing. I am sobbing like an idiot, but I don&#39;t care any 
more. All I can do is wet Relena&#39;s dress as she gently rocks me.
&quot;I love you, Hilde,&quot; She softly kisses my tears away, &quot;Even if you 
taste salty.&quot;

I laugh a little through my tears, &quot;Ai Shiteru.&quot;

Relena slowly kisses my lips, and my neck.

&quot;Want to go back to my room?&quot; Relena asks softly, &quot;The guy who does 
the lighting and the music can&#39;t hear us, but he can see us.&quot;

I nod as I lift her up in my arms.

&quot;Hilde!&quot; Relena exclaims in surprise.

&quot;Just display of power,&quot; I whisper into her hair, &quot;I am told that 
turns women on.&quot;

Relena&#39;s face feels hot against my chest. She is silent as I begin 
to walk out of the ballroom with my prize in my arms.

&quot;My room or your&#39;s,&quot; Relena says ever so quietly.

Oh my gosh. oh my gosh. oh my gosh. I think she just agreed to.

&quot;I think we waited long enough, don&#39;t you?&quot; Relena slowly undo the 
first button on my shirt while her fingers brush lightly against my 
skin. I shiver slightly at her touch, but my mind is completely 
blank.

&quot;My room,&quot; Relena decides for us since I am unable to produce 
coherent thoughts because her hand is dancing across my collar bone. 
It takes all my self-control not to do her right here, right now.

I don&#39;t know how we manage to get back to her room. As I fumble to 
open the door with the former queen of the world in my arms, Relena 
undoes the next button on my shirt and kisses my breasts. 

I kick the door open and slam it as soon as I pass through it.
&quot;Was that another demonstration of power?&quot; Relena asks me as I throw 
her on the bed.

&quot;No, that was desperation,&quot; I begin to unbutton her jacket. She 
arches her back to help me undress her. 

&quot;Oh God,&quot; Relena moans softly as my hand finds her breast.

I.

*BEEP*

&quot;What the hell?!&quot; I jump at the sound of Relena&#39;s two way intercom 
system.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Relena sit up a little to answer her intercom.

&quot;Relena,&quot; Wufei&#39;s voice comes through the intercom, &quot;Do you know 
where Hilde is at the moment? I&#39;m having trouble locating her.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s with me, Wufei.&quot; I don&#39;t know how she manages to sound so 
calm while I&#39;m nibbling on her neck.

&quot;Hilde, Lady Une informs me that you have been offered the position 
of an active agent. Have you made a decision?&quot; Wufei asks.

I glance at the clock. It&#39;s 12:01am. So this is what Lady Une meant 
by &quot;tomorrow morning&quot;.

&quot;I have decided to accept the position, Wufei,&quot; I try my best not to 
moan as Relena begins to kiss my chest.

&quot;In that case, please meet me in the conference room tomorrow at five 
hundred hours for your first mission brief,&quot; Wufei continues without 
emotion.

&quot;I copy that. Anything else?&quot; I ask him, barely surpressing a 
grumble.

&quot;No, Wufei out.&quot;

&quot;He did that to annoy me,&quot; I tell Relena as I begin to kiss her 
again. To my surprise, she stops me.

&quot;Hilde, that&#39;s in five hours,&quot; Relena informs me calmly.

&quot;So?&quot; I demand.

&quot;So you better get some sleep,&quot; Relena kisses me on the forehead.

&quot;But but but but but..&quot; I mumble.

&quot;I will not have you die because of a lack of sleep,&quot; Relena&#39;s voice 
is quite firm.

I start to make small whimper noises as I get off the bed.

&quot;Stay with me tonight?&quot; Relena smiles as her hand catches mine.

&quot;Of course,&quot; I get crawl back into bed with her.

God, the bed smells so much like her I struggle to get my hormones 
under control. I&#39;m glad we both decided if we are to get any sleep 
we need to keep all of our clothes on.

&quot;Did I ever tell you how extraordinary you are?&quot; I tell her as I wrap 
my arms around her.

&quot;No more than you,&quot; Relena snuggles up against me.

I close my eyes and breath in the smell of lilac.

Just another ordinary day.
