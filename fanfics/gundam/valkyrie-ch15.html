<a href="../gundam/valkyrie-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>	&quot;Second division backup, standing by.&quot;

	Lt. Timothy Ayner sighed, all his muscles tight with worry.  He
looked down, rubbing his thumb against the picture taped below the
official country banner engraved into the metal panel of his suit.  It was
a small good luck charm he always kept with him, a picture of his
girlfriend, just recently replaced with a picture the girlfriend who had
become his wife, and their newborn son.

	The pilot swallowed hard, looking out over the field, no illusions
of glory clouding his vision.  As far as he was concerned, this entire war
was nonsense.  Everyone knew what that border munitions depot had been
primed to do, almost no one among the enlisted men blamed the Sank kingdom
for attacking it.  All this battle would do was feed the prime minister&#39;s
ego, and make sure there were a few more chances to make the battle even
bigger, blow it up into another world war.

	//It&#39;ll also get a lot of good men killed today.//

	He was no stranger to battle.  He had even been given a few medals
in his last fight, for succeeding in a plan so stupidly suicidal that
there was no way it /couldn&#39;t/ have worked.  The pilot figured it set him
up perfectly for this situation.  There was nothing more inherently stupid
than fighting Gundams.

	//We&#39;re gonna get slaughtered, I don&#39;t care /how/ many of us there
are.//

	He could not participate in the gloating banter between the other
pilots, who were trying to pump themselves up before the big battle, words
of victory coming much too soon for his taste.	Tim knew, no matter /what/
was set up against a Gundam, the massive war machines did not go down
without one hell of a fight.

	//If you can take them down at all.//

	He just hoped, perhaps, they wouldn&#39;t show.  That somehow, the
main swell of the battle would be diverted elsewhere.  It may have been
cowardly, but in his opinion, so was this entire pointless battle.

	&quot;We&#39;ve got initial contact.&quot;

	The scout suit&#39;s video display popped up on every screen in the
front lines, showed a very large Gundam with a long, glowing scythe
roaring toward them, followed by another, and another, leading the rest of
the Sank army toward them.  Tim let his hand drop down to the picture
again, touching his wife&#39;s smile, the baby-fine softness on the top of his
son&#39;s head, praying without words in the moments before the battle
engulfed them all.

------------------------

	&quot;On your six!  On your six!!!&quot;

	Tim turned, blasting through an enemy suit just a few seconds
before it reached him, dodging out of the way as the flaming wreckage
plunged toward the ground.  They had been doing well enough, and that had
been with /three/ Gundams on the field, but now -

	&quot;Look out!!!&quot;

	Tim took a few steps backward as he turned, wishing the suit were
invisible, so that he could see what was happening sooner, that he didn&#39;t
give the enemy such an obviously open window of attack.  One of the two
new Gundams sliced through a suit just behind him, Tim heard the pilot
scream, a crackle of static, and silence.  

He locked eyes with the suit, raised his gun, and exhaled a breath he
hadn&#39;t even known he had taken as the Gundam turned away, attacking
another suit that had fired a second before he had.  Tim growled,
clenching his teeth, preparing to fire at the back of the Gundam, before
it could finish off its opponent.  He didn&#39;t think it would actually
damage the suit, but there was simply nothing else he could do.

	&quot;Squads two and four, be advised, we are picking up something very
strange on your radar, descending at - holy /shit/, descending rapidly at
mark 4-oh!  This thing&#39;s headed right toward you!!!&quot;

	Tim could see it, felt his heart drop for a moment. It looked like
little more than a massive warhead.

	//The Sank wouldn&#39;t?  Wouldn&#39;t self-destruct its own forces, not
for /this/?!//

	Before Tim could react, he watched as the &quot;bomb&quot; changed shape,
and one massive wing stretched up along its back, slowing its fall, just
barely.  The massive machine plowed right through the front line, Tim
could see various small explosions as it shot in all directions, though
its attacks seemed to be doing much less visible damage than the other
Gundam suits.  Almost immediately, the radio erupted into chaos.

	&quot;What the-?&quot;

	&quot;... suit!  I can&#39;t /move/!&quot;

	&quot;Stuck to the ground!  What is this shit?!&quot;

	&quot;... can&#39;t see a goddamn thing!&quot;

	Tim gaped as the massive machine came to rest, watching silently
as the massive body reached toward the sky in one fluid, elegant movement,
wing rising up behind it like the banner of some avenging angel.  

	&quot;That&#39;s a Gundam.&quot; 

He breathed, and only then realized he was standing almost directly in its
path, with no cover, at dead stop.

	//Shit. SHIT!!!//

	Tim raised his gun, but even as he did so, he saw he was far too
late.  The Gundam had already lifted its own weapon, a massive, dark
cannon lying across the white arm, and fired at him.  Tim looked down at
the picture taped to his controls, watching the massive shot approach
almost in slow motion, and winced as the deathblow hit.

	The suit rocked slightly, there was a loud, almost ear-shattering
noise from the radio, and a few sparks flew up from each of his control
panels.  Tim blinked, coughing, waving away the smoke rising up from
around him, surprised it hadn&#39;t /hurt/ more.  The cockpit was dark, he
could still hear the battle raging around him.	If this was what death
felt like, he thought, it was pretty damn pathetic.

	//You&#39;re not dead, stupid.  All the systems are shorted out. 
You&#39;re just frozen on the battlefield.	The gun didn&#39;t kill you.//

	It wasn&#39;t exactly where he wanted to be, he thought, as he heard a
few explosions outside, too close for comfort.
  
	//It&#39;s still better than being dead.  Much better.  But... that
was a dead-on shot!  What in the hell did that Gundam hit me with?//

---------------------------

	&quot;Holy shit!  /That/ didn&#39;t happen in the simulation.&quot;  

	Relena blinked, staring out the forward window, watching as the
electrical blast from the Longbow arced from ship to ship, taking out not
one, but five enemy suits with a single shot.  She could hear Dorothy
chuckling gleefully behind her, firing multiple shots in wide arcs across
the field, testing all of Howard&#39;s weapon systems at once.

	//I never thought, I never really thought that I&#39;d actually be in
a battle.//

	Relena almost sensed the incoming shot before she saw it, had
already brought the Valkyrie into a low roll before she saw the suit that
was firing on her.

	&quot;Dorothy?&quot;

	&quot;Already on it.&quot;

	&quot;How?&quot;

	Relena bit off her question, dodging another few shots, leaping
into the air to allow Dorothy enough range for another shot with the
Longbow, knocking out nearly another whole regiment of the army&#39;s
offensive line.  They landed almost too lightly to be believed, turning
swiftly, surveying the rest of the battlefield for a moment before firing
off another round of magnets toward the enemy.	

The prime minister&#39;s forces were in barely controlled chaos now, swarming
away from their former positions, retreating, trying to regroup.

	//Oh, I don&#39;t /think/ so.//

	Relena smiled to herself, picking out what seemed to be the
weakest spot in the new offensive line, feeling the power building in the
machine beneath her, ready to strike, to leap into the battle once more.

	&quot;Dorothy?&quot;

	The blonde laughed again.

&quot;Just lead the way!&quot;

	Relena paused, unable to continue the attack, curiosity piqued.
	
&quot;How the hell do you do that?&quot;
	
&quot;Hm?&quot;  Dorothy was still firing, laying a line of magnetic restraints and
vibration disks over the enemy forces.	&quot;Do what?&quot;

&quot;Know what I&#39;m going to do, know where to fire even before I&#39;m pointed
that way?&quot;

	&quot;Tandem system.  The Valkyrie&#39;s core operating program.  It&#39;s what
we spent all that time on in training...  The system naturally adapts to
two-person input, and gives me the best possible targeting system based on
those results.	It lets me sense your reactions as soon as you make them,
and adapt.&quot;

	&quot;Ah, so I&#39;m not suddenly psychic, then.&quot;

	Dorothy laughed, an elated, husky purr.

	&quot;Relena, if you could read my thoughts right now, you&#39;d probably
kick me right out of this Gundam.&quot;

-------------------------

	&quot;So, are we going to go out there, or are we just going to sit
here like lumps?&quot;

	For the last few minutes, none of the Gundam pilots had moved,
just watched from various positions on the field, as the new suit reduced
the enemy ships to rubble, moving swiftly and efficiently through their
ranks, cutting them down left and right.

	&quot;I vote lump.&quot;	Duo muttered, watching the new suit fight its way
out of a mob of enemy fighters with incredible ease.  &quot;Is it just me, or
does that suit not seem to be doing any actual /damage/?&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t know... that looks like plenty of damage to me.&quot;  Quatre
responded, staring at the remains of suits littering the battlefield.

	&quot;Duo&#39;s right, though, it looks like all the cockpits are still
whole - untouched.&quot;  Trowa frowned, knowing there was something very
important he was overlooking.

	&quot;No casualties.  They&#39;re fighting a battle, but nobody&#39;s dying.&quot;

	Quatre&#39;s confused tone spoke for them all.  Trowa&#39;s eyes narrowed.


&quot;Well, we can&#39;t just sit back and watch. I&#39;m going in there.&quot;

	The pilot only got one foot out, moved slightly from his position,
when a large, dark ball flew out from one of the new suit&#39;s arms, coming
straight at him.

	&quot;Trowa!&quot;

	There wasn&#39;t enough time to react, Trowa flinched as the strike
hit, and the entire cockpit went black.

	&quot;Trowa!  Trowa!!!&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s okay.  I&#39;m... all right?&quot;  

Trowa blinked, realizing that, whatever horrible attack he had been
expecting, it hadn&#39;t happened yet, and looked like it wasn&#39;t going to. 
The brunette pilot looked out his now opaque cockpit window, seeing tiny
bubbles on the other side of the cockpit glass, a slow moving substance
that had completely covered his view of the field.

//... tar?//

&quot;Stay out of this, boys.  This battle is /mine/.&quot;

	All the pilots blinked, and Heero gasped as a decidedly female
growl cut over their communication links, delivering a short, sweet
message.

&quot;What the-?&quot;

&quot;Who the hell was that?&quot;

The Wing Zero was already in the air, roaring into the heat of battle with
weapons online and targeted.  No one else had figured it out, but Heero
recognized that voice all too well, and it filled him with fury, and a new
mission, to leave pieces of the new Gundam all over the battlefield.

&quot;DOROTHY!!!!&quot;

-----------------------------

Relena had taken over some of the weapons systems, mainly aiming shots
into the back ranks with the Longbow whenever she got the chance, when she
wasn&#39;t blocking incoming fire with the massive shield on the Gundam&#39;s arm.
 It should have been awkward, at the very least it should have been
unnerving, but Relena felt nothing but excitement, thrilled at the ease
with which the suit responded to her commands, watching the enemy&#39;s ranks
slowly dissolve into complete chaos right in front of her.  She could see,
both through the cockpit and the high-resolution monitors, the results of
her attacks, including one very colorful result from the shakers that had
attached themselves to a nearby suit.  Relena couldn&#39;t help but laugh as
the suit almost jumped up and down, before it cracked, nearly down the
middle, falling apart like a shelled nut.  She grimaced, watching as the
pilot lost what had been his lunch down the side of the one still-vertical
leg.

//Oops, zoomed in a little too close on that one.//

Her head swiveled, as she saw the other arm swing outward, watched one of
the suit&#39;s shots hurl far out, towards the Gundams, perched at the edge of
the battle.

&quot;Who was that for?&quot;  Relena was just a little surprised the Gundams
weren&#39;t attacking yet.

//What are they waiting for?//

&quot;If the Gundams interfere now, it won&#39;t be a peaceful victory, Relena. 
They&#39;ll kill, it&#39;s all they can do.  We can&#39;t let them enter the battle
now.  We have to win this one on our own.&quot;

Relena nodded, and turned quickly as she saw a blur of motion on her
right.	Almost immediately, she felt the control wrenched out from under
her, the Valkyrie swerving sharply back to where it had been facing.

&quot;Dorothy, what&#39;s going-?&quot;

Relena lost the end of her sentence, as she looked up, and saw Wing Zero
charging at them, green energy sword drawn and blazing. She couldn&#39;t
believe what she heard, Heero&#39;s voice screaming Dorothy&#39;s name, more angry
than she had ever heard him before.

	&quot;Heero?!&quot;

	Relena yelled his name again as his sword connected with the
Valkyrie&#39;s shields, and realized that Dorothy had switched over
/everything/, including communications, to her control.  This was a fight
between her and Yuy, the other girl was now helpless in the suit.  

Relena searched the control panels around her, trying to reestablish a
connection to the suit, listening to the battle of words, nearly as
vicious as that of blows, as Dorothy and Heero entered their brutal duel.
	
&quot;Hello again, Heero.&quot;  Dorothy smiled around gritted teeth, as she slid
out from around the first strike, lashing out as Heero&#39;s suit stumbled
forward slightly.  The Japanese pilot recovered too quickly for her attack
to work, and started slashing out, again and again with his sword, the
Valkyrie matching him, blocking each strike. Neither suit was giving any
ground.

	&quot;Where&#39;s Relena?&quot;

	Relena gasped in surprise, but quickly realized that there wasn&#39;t
any way he could know she was inside the suit.	She pounded on a few more
buttons, unable to figure out what her partner had done as the Valkyrie
dodged and attacked, slamming her around in the cockpit like a doll in a
tumble dryer.

	&quot;Why would you care?&quot;

	Heero snarled, and gave up his tactical assault, dropping his
sword and simply slamming into the Valkyrie full force.  The suits crashed
backward, Dorothy taken off guard by the surprise attack, unable to
compensate.

	&quot;Where is she, you /bitch/!!!&quot;

	&quot;Again, I ask.&quot;  Dorothy snarled, slowly forcing his arm from its
bar grip on the Valkyrie&#39;s neck.  &quot;Why the hell do you care where Relena
is?!&quot;

	&quot;This isn&#39;t going to work.&quot;  Heero laughed sharply.  &quot;I&#39;m not
going to let you mess with me like that.  You&#39;re going to tell me where
Relena is before I kill you, and then I&#39;ll get her back, and everything
will be all right.  Everything will be the way it was before.&quot;

	&quot;Ah yes, she&#39;ll go back to being everyone&#39;s hope for the future,
and you&#39;ll go back into space?&quot;

	&quot;Yes!&quot;	Heero screamed, realizing his mistake the moment he said
it.  &quot;No!  I -I...&quot;

	The Gundam staggered back slightly. Heero pulled out the glowing
green blade once again, but didn&#39;t attack right away, almost freezing in
place.	His voice was angry, but more hesitant.  Dorothy had gotten to
him, just a little, and he was unsure of himself.

	&quot;It isn&#39;t - you&#39;re just making things difficult. It was fine,
everything was fine before you interfered!&quot;

	&quot;I did a lot more than interfere, Yuy.&quot;  Dorothy was beside
herself with anger, unable to believe that even now, Heero could lie to
himself, could put Relena back in her gilded cage, lock the door and walk
away without more than a moment of easily buried regret.  She wanted to
hurt him, and knew exactly how to do it.

	&quot;I can tell you right now, your pretty little future is never
going to happen.  I won&#39;t let you treat Relena like an object anymore.	If
it means I have to fight against the Sank my entire life, I swear you&#39;ll
never get your hands on her again.&quot;  She smiled, wishing she could see the
look on her rival&#39;s face.

	&quot;And if you kill me, you can be sure that Relena will /never/
forgive you.  I told you not to walk away, that it was your last chance to
tell her how you felt.	Now Relena&#39;s found someone else, someone to love
her the way you were too afraid to!&quot;

	&quot;SHUT UP!!!!&quot;

	Dorothy knew it was the worst thing she could say to him, knew
that Heero realized he had lost, really lost, and he wanted to kill her
for it now more than ever.

	//What I wanted.  You think I&#39;m afraid of you, Perfect Soldier? 
Come on, you want me dead, you son of a bitch?	Bring it on!!!//

	Her first shot with the Longbow missed, and the blonde barely
pulled it out of the way as Heero&#39;s sword came up.  The blow that landed
against her shield arm shook the entire Valkyrie so hard her teeth
rattled.

	//You&#39;re pissed, Yuy?  Well, guess what? I am too!//

	If this was going to be the final fight, she was damn sure not
going to let Heero walk away with an easy victory.  The pilot was still
screaming at her, a few words growled now and again between vicious
attacks on her suit.

	&quot;You.  You did this to her.  If I get rid of you, I get rid of the
problem.&quot;
  
	Dorothy blocked his sword strikes, unable to do more at the
moment, searching for an opening, a chance to counter.	She reminded
herself that there was still a war going on, despite their duel, and that
Yuy wasn&#39;t the only danger.  Heero seemed to share none of her concerns,
still ranting and raving inside his suit.

	&quot;All I have to do... is kill you, and she&#39;ll come back.  She&#39;ll be
fine.  Everything will be back to normal.&quot;

	Heero swung down, and Dorothy missed the edge of the stroke,
winced with the realization that the blade had cut into the Valkyrie&#39;s
left leg, not a severe injury, but one that would slow her down enough for
trouble.  Already, she saw Heero&#39;s sword rising up again, and realized she
had to think of something, /fast/.

	&quot;This is all your fault!  You did this to her!	You messed with
her head!  All I have to do is kill you, and everything will be all
right.&quot;

	&quot;Stop it, Heero.&quot;

	The Wing Zero froze, Heero choking on the rest of his angry words,
stunned at the voice that broke through the Valkyrie&#39;s communications.

	&quot;Relena?&quot;

	In the cockpit of the Valkyrie, Relena had finally managed to
regain control of the radio.  The brunette was watching the Wing Zero
carefully, not needing, not /wanting/ to see the brown-haired pilot&#39;s
reaction to what she knew she had to say.

	&quot;Just stop.  This isn&#39;t the time, or the place for this.  We&#39;re in
the middle of a war, if you hadn&#39;t noticed.&quot;

	&quot;... Relena?&quot;  Heero sounded like a broken record, the same tone,
the same infliction of disbelief in his voice as he said her name.  &quot;What
are you doing?&quot;

	He sounded so shocked, so lost, but Relena couldn&#39;t lie to him,
couldn&#39;t afford to pull her punches.

	&quot;This is my Gundam, Heero.  The Valkyrie.  It&#39;s mine.  Mine and
Dorothy&#39;s.&quot;

	&quot;A Gundam?  But... but /why/?!&quot;  Heero&#39;s voice was a taut, hoarse
whisper.  &quot;We could protect you.  /I/ could protect you, just fine.&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t want to be protected, Heero.  I can&#39;t afford to be a
ruler who can&#39;t take care of herself.  The Sank doesn&#39;t need a person like
that in command.&quot;

	&quot;You don&#39;t need me at all, then.&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s not it at all!&quot;  Relena hated the way he always took the
situation to extremes, especially this one, because she could no longer
give him what he seemed, only now, to want.

	&quot;You&#39;ll always be my friend, Heero.  Always.  I would never ask
you to leave the Sank kingdom.&quot;

	&quot;F-friend?&quot;  Heero spluttered out the word, more shocked than he
should have been.  &quot;Then you, and Dorothy... she wasn&#39;t lying?&quot;

	&quot;No.  Dorothy wasn&#39;t lying.&quot;  Relena was too focused on the
conversation to hear the blonde&#39;s tiny sigh of relief.

	&quot;But Relena, I...&quot; Heero sounded devastated.  &quot;I.  I love...&quot;
	&quot;Heero.&quot;  The brown haired girl winced, not wanting to hurt him,
knowing there was no other way.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s just too late for that.&quot;


	Before another word could be spoken, an alarm shrieked inside the
Valkyrie&#39;s cockpit.

	&quot;Incoming!!!&quot;  Dorothy shouted, raising the suit&#39;s shield arm
toward the sky.

----------------------------

	Wufei didn&#39;t know exactly what was going on, except that Heero Yuy
seemed to have just abandoned everything he had ever learned about battle,
as soon as he found out who was in the new Gundam suit.  The dark-haired
Asian pilot had easily recognized Dorothy Catalonia&#39;s voice, and was not
terribly surprised at Heero&#39;s reaction, just a little ashamed.

	//Hung up on Relena, eh?  Going crazy over a woman?  Pretty sad,,
Heero, especially for you.//

	The Wing Zero had, of course, been more than a match for the
girl&#39;s suit, though Wufei was surprised the Gundam pilot wasn&#39;t doing
better against Dorothy. The two were actually evenly matched.  Wufei
didn&#39;t know what was said between them, the two pilots had switched to a
private channel as soon as their battle had started. 

Which meant there was no way to contact them when the enemies&#39; left flank,
which Wufei had assumed was soundly beaten, suddenly surged forward in a
surprise attack.  

Quatre and Trowa vanished in the mob of enemy suits, the latter pilot&#39;s
Gundam still operating with almost no visual acuity.  Wufei engaged a few
ships that were taking advantage of this fact, destroying them easily as
they focused solely on the Heavyarms.  After the simple fight, Wufei
noticed, the Wing Zero had frozen in place, along with Catalonia&#39;s suit,
in the middle of the battlefield.

//Yuy, you /idiot/!  What do you think you&#39;re doing?!//

Wufei saw the incoming missile on his radar, but there was no way to warn
either suit in time.  Dorothy&#39;s Gundam seemed to see the attack at the
last second, raising one arm just before both ships were engulfed in a
massive explosion.

-------------------------

&quot;YES!!!&quot;
	
The prime minister pounded his hand against the dashboard of the armored
carrier, watching the explosion from a guarded position across the
battlefield.  He had been a little nervous when the new suit had appeared,
but it had made an incredibly bad tactical decision by stopping in the
middle of the field, and he had taken full advantage of it.  The man
standing behind him did not seem to share his enthusiasm.

&quot;I don&#39;t believe that suit was sent to kill.  We&#39;re receiving reports of
no casualties from the downed suits.&quot;

&quot;Who cares?&quot;  The prime minister laughed.  &quot;That&#39;ll put that bitch in her
place, wherever she is.&quot;

The minister of Finance stood against one wall, arms crossed, utterly
unimpressed.  While the prime minister&#39;s policies of national pride had
been well accepted among the people, his declaration of war made
/everyone/ nervous, most of all the Parliament.  No one was eager to
return to a full-out war, and while the prime minister had been gathering
his forces, the parliament had been quietly making plans.

//We&#39;re not going to win this war.  Not against six Gundams.  This has
gotten out of hand.//

The finance minister heard the prime minister choke as the smoke cleared
from the battlefield, revealing both suits, in perfect shape.  The Finance
minister had been expecting it.

The new suit rose to its feet, and pulled out its massive primary cannon,
delivering a punishing retaliatory strike deep into their territory. 
Flashes of electricity leapt from suit to suit across the long line, but,
just as before, there were no explosions, and no fatalities.

&quot;No.  NO!&quot;  The prime minister howled directions into his radio, sending
every suit he could back into the fray, now focused only on destroying the
Gundams, determined to fight the battle to the last.

//Thankfully, we have a backup plan.//

The minister of Finance quietly walked away, out of the armored carrier. 
After a few moments, he pulled out his cell phone.

&quot;Hello?  Yes.  Yes.  Everything is in order.  Please start the maneuver.&quot; 
He hung up the phone, walking just a little bit faster away from the prime
minister&#39;s position. &quot;This battle has gone on for far too long.&quot;

------------------------

Duo had his first suspicions about the new Gundam when the familiar sound
of rock music filled the Deathscythe&#39;s cockpit, effectively jamming all
communications on the normal frequencies.  He flipped a switch, turning
the radio to a Gundam-only frequency, as a realization began piecing
together in his brain.

&quot;-in the world is going on?&quot;  Quatre burst in, exasperated.

&quot;That new Gundam just took out Wing Zero.&quot;  Duo said mildly, watching the
massive black wing unfold from the back of the new Gundam. The suit took
off, leaving the Wing Zero stuck to the ground in a huge pile of some sort
of chemical foam.  The American pilot couldn&#39;t tell, but it didn&#39;t look
like Heero was doing much to try and fight his way out of it either.

Duo thought about calling the other pilot, to make sure he was okay, but
remembering how angry Yuy had been only a few minutes before made him
think the better of it.

//I wonder what they were talking about?//

&quot;Anyone know how Catalonia managed to get a Gundam?&quot;  Trowa murmured.  The
pilot sounded all right, a little relieved after being able to get enough
of the black goo off his window to see the battlefield.

Duo didn&#39;t answer, flipping his com link back to the regular channel,
listening to the surf-rock anthems still obliterating any other
communications.

//If I didn&#39;t know better - One of the last things /Howard/ did to the
Deathscythe was add one of these scrambler thingies.//

Duo had thoroughly enjoyed playing the &quot;Top Gun&quot; soundtrack every chance
he got for a while, annoying both enemies and any nearby allies.

//... but Howard, working for Catalona?!  Not possible.//

Duo frowned, realizing his deductive powers were pretty much useless
against this problem.

&quot;Hey, look at that!&quot;

Duo looked up, as Quatre alerted them to the fact that a small contingent
of their rebel friends, Tyse and three other ships, were now hurrying up
the battlefield, running deep into enemy territory.

&quot;Where the hell are they going?&quot;  Duo muttered.

&quot;It almost looks like... there&#39;s no one trying to stop them?&quot;  Quatre was
puzzled, and he was not the only one.

&quot;It&#39;s a trap, it has to be.&quot; Trowa frowned, watching moment after moment,
as no enemy forces attacked the four suits.  &quot;... but for who?&quot;

------------------------

Relena shut off the scrambler, heard Dorothy chuckle in amusement as three
suits, completely turned around by the lack of radio communications, flew
right into their path with a scattering of sudden obscenities.	

The brunette wasn&#39;t sure where the magnet she shot hit, only that the
first suit&#39;s engine spluttered, died and the suit made a long sweeping
trail right into the ground, skidding a half-mile or so away.  Dorothy
leapt up to catch the second suit by one leg, swinging around and sending
it crashing into the other suit, both of whom fell into a massive tangle
of metal at the base of a small hill.

&quot;We can&#39;t keep doing this forever, Dorothy.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;  Dorothy laughed again, bringing the windshield cover cannon up
for another few shots.	&quot;Aren&#39;t you having fun?&quot;

Relena ignored her question, looking around the battlefield.  It had been
the right decision, she knew, to stop the Wing Zero where they had, but
she also knew that, given time, Heero could be in danger.  There were too
many incapacitated suits, too many chances for easy kills, and she didn&#39;t
want any more bloodshed.

&quot;We&#39;ve got to find the prime minister.	If we find him, we stop this
battle. We&#39;ve already got Trowa and Heero incapacitated.&quot;

&quot;-and Wufei.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

Dorothy lined up the Longbow&#39;s shot, waiting just after the
moment Nataku struck its enemy to fire her own blast.  It was petty, it
was pointless, and the blonde knew it was something she absolutely /had/
to do.
	
&quot;Stick this in your tailpipe, Mr. I-won&#39;t-fight-women.&quot;
	
Relena watched the two-part beam blast into the Asian pilot&#39;s suit, looked
down to a gauge on the Valkyrie&#39;s control panel to see that the energy
from Wufei&#39;s Gundam had been transferred into their own.  It was a
surprisingly small amount.
	
&quot;Everyone&#39;s running out of time here, there&#39;s already been too much
fighting.  We&#39;ve got to come up with a solution.&quot;

The leader of the Sank kingdom bit her lip, mind racing.  The Valkyrie was
an amazing piece of machinery, that much was true, but even it could not
win a war on its own.
	
//Think, Relena.  Think.//

	&quot;Hey?  Where are they going?&quot;
	
Relena looked up, as four suits zoomed past them, headed to some unknown
point in the distance.	The brunette&#39;s eyes narrowed.
	
&quot;Follow them.&quot;

--------------------------

	&quot;Hello there.&quot;

	They hadn&#39;t been following the rebel suits long before they were
noticed.  Relena thought she recognized the cheery purr that rumbled
across her com link, but it was a vague identification at that.

	&quot;... and who might I have the privilege of speaking to?&quot;  The
voice continued, the steely tone only half-hidden by false cheer.

	&quot;This is Relena Peacecraft, pilot of the Valkyrie and ruler of the
Sank kingdom.&quot;

	&quot;Peacecraft?!&quot;	

	The brunette heard other communications links open up, as the
other pilots voiced their surprise.  Relena could also hear Dorothy
checking weapon and shield systems as they flew down into enemy territory,
but strangely enough, no one had fired on them for quite a while.

	&quot;Yes.  We&#39;ve come here to stop this war.&quot;

	The pilots all laughed, before the one who had first hailed her
spoke up again.

	&quot;Well... ma&#39;am.  I guess if anyone could do it, you&#39;d be the one.&quot;


Relena arched an eyebrow.

&quot;Just who am I talking to?&quot;

&quot;This is Tyse Derrick, current leader of the rebellion.  I was the one who
called you a... &quot;worthless, ineffectual puppet&quot; at the last meeting
between our three countries.&quot;  He laughed.  &quot;I take it back now, of
course.&quot;

&quot;Where are we going, exactly?&quot;

His voice became more serious, and betrayed his excitement.

&quot;We got a leak out from their internal chain of command, that the prime
minister is out here somewhere.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d say that&#39;s pretty convenient.&quot;  Dorothy murmured to Relena.  &quot;It&#39;s
also convenient that they&#39;ve stopped firing at us.&quot;

Relena shut off her outgoing com link for a moment, turning slightly
towards her partner.  

&quot;What do you think?&quot;

&quot;Well, as a random, bullshit guess-&quot; Dorothy frowned.  &quot;I&#39;d say...&quot; She
murmured to herself, thinking out loud.  &quot;It just doesn&#39;t make sense, when
there was no way we could do this before.  There&#39;s /no/ cover fire.  It&#39;s
almost like they /want/ us to kill him.&quot;

&quot;There he is!!!  Right /THERE/!!!&quot;

Relena turned, as Tyse&#39;s triumphant cry tore through the conversation, and
the other pilots whooped and hollered over the com link.  The brown-haired
girl could see the small black building, sticking out from the landscape
like a sore thumb, surrounded by only a few guns, one or two suits.

//This isn&#39;t right.  There&#39;s no way they&#39;d put an important leader in
there, unless-//

Relena&#39;s eyes widened, she gasped, and instantly hit the Valkyrie&#39;s
booster engines, throwing the Valkyrie directly into the path of Tyse
Derrick and his companions.
