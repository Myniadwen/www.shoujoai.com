<h1>When the Shadow and the Hammer Fall (part 5 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bluegrif.html">Blue Griffin</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gundam/shadham-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>It wasn&#39;t until the wedding photos were developing that Hilde had a
chance to talk to Dorothy privately. &quot;Dorothy, what in the world are you
really doing?&quot; Hilde asked.

Dorothy smiled sweetly at Hilde, &quot;Protecting Releena, of course!&quot; She
continued kawaiily, &quot;It&#39;s such a wonderful cover, no one would ever
suspect.&quot;

Hilde rubbed her temple, where the veins had formed a throbbing &#39;x&#39;. She
asked &quot;Don&#39;t play games with me, Dorothy, please?&quot;

Dorothy pouted cutely. &quot;You take all the fun out of things,&quot; she softly
grumbled under her breath. She thought about what to say a moment, then
decided to be frank &quot;Both you and Releena show a lack of sense in
romantic relationships.&quot; She stopped Hilde from whatever protest she
could make with a raised finger and continued &quot;I care a lot about
Releena, maybe part of me still loves her, but she doesn&#39;t love me like
I would like her to, at least not anymore. She has noticed you, however,
so I intend to give her a chance to get you.&quot;

&quot;You and Releena were lovers?&quot; Hilde blinked at her in surprise, and
then she shook her head. &quot;Excuse me, but don&#39;t I get a say in this?&quot; she
asked plaintively.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Dorothy said with a smile. &quot;If Releena does snag you, you can
always say &#39;no&#39;. You&#39;d be an idiot, but...&quot;

Hilde sighed, but before she could say anything else, Releena walked out
of the photo-mart with the package of photos. &quot;Dotty-chan, did you
really have to zoom in on the kiss?&quot; A sweatdropped Releena asked her.

Dorothy grinned impishly as she shot back, &quot;Where else would you have
liked me to zoom in on, pray tell?&quot;

Releena decided it was probably safer not to pursue that. &quot;So now we
honeymoon?&quot; Releena said dubiously.

Dorothy reached into her coat and handed Hilde a packet, &quot;I&#39;ve booked
rooms for you, maps and other information are included. Your new
passports are also in there, as well as credit cards and a generous
amount of cash.&quot;

&quot;And how do we get there? Or are you going to chauffeur us everywhere?&quot;
Hilde asked.

Dorothy looked thoughtful. &quot;Chauffeuring you sounds fun, but...&quot; she
said with a smile. She whistled loudly, and a black, European sports
car came around the corner. The young woman who drove it smoothly
climbed out and with a charming smile passed the keys to Dorothy.

&quot;Please visit our dealership again,&quot; the dark hared woman said, and
smiled very warmly at Dorothy. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen anybody pay cash for a
car like that, you definitely have style,&quot; she said admiringly.

&quot;To the newlyweds,&quot; Dorothy said, passing the keys to them. &quot;Now, if
you&#39;ll excuse me?&quot; Dorothy said, and followed the dark hared girl down
the street.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know she went that way before today,&quot; Hilde said, surprised.

&quot;Don&#146;t be so surprised.&quot; Releena said wistfully. &quot;Heero was my first
time with a man, but Dorothy was my first time with a woman.&quot;

Hilde stared almost gaping at her, &quot;I-I had no idea!&quot;

&quot;That I was bisexual?&quot; Releena finished, almost chuckling. &quot;I&#146;m not the
virginal princess that everyone thinks I am, Hilde. By the way, I
understand you swing both ways too, or is that just a rumor in
Preventer HQ?&quot;

Hilde looked at her in shock, but quickly recovered. &quot;Actually I am. Duo
kept talking about having a three-way when he found out,&quot; Hilde replied.
&quot;God he could be such a pain.&quot;

Hilde added in her thoughts &#39;I should have known, though. Mental note:
do more thorough background checks on agents.&#39; Hilde smiled, went around
to the passenger&#39;s side and gallantly held the door open for Releena.
&quot;Your carriage awaits, madam.&quot;

&quot;Thank you so much, kind sir,&quot; Releena answered, curtseying a bit and
taking her seat.

Releena smiled up at Hilde, who felt as if her heart had stopped.
&#39;Releena is really beautiful,&#39; Hilde thought, and added a bit sadly &#39;but
what would she want with me, anyway?&#39; She moved to the driver&#39;s seat,
and sat down. &quot;Next stop, luxury hotel!&quot; Hilde announced, starting the
car.

The drive was quiet, as they were both preoccupied by their own racing
thoughts. Releena found herself looking over at Hilde, and admired the
handsome woman&#39;s profile. &#39;She&#39;s so good looking,&#39; Releena thought, &#39;and
I don&#39;t think she even knows it.&#39; She then thought of the interested
gaze the saleswoman gave, and the looks Hilde had gotten at the last
hotel they stayed in. &#39;She could have anyone,&#39; Releena sighed mentally,
&#39;so how do I get her to notice me?&#39; Releena eyes widened, as she
realized what she had thought.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Hilde asked her worriedly.

Releena blushed a bit. &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; she said reassuringly. Hilde smiled
at her warmly then turned back to the road.

A few minutes later, they reached the first hotel they had been booked
in. An old fashioned manor house, it sat secluded from the busy traffic
of the nearby highway. A female valet took the car, a buswoman took the
bags, and they checked in at the desk where a pretty business suited
woman took their information. They then were led up to the penthouse
suite by a young woman wearing a old style French maid&#39;s costume, who
unlocked the door, placed their bags inside while giving them a view of
her panties under her short skirt, and handed them their keys.

Hilde tipped her generously, and she left, taking a moment to smile at
the Preventer bodyguard as she said to her sweetly &quot;Our maid service is
available twenty four hours a day, so if you need anything, anything at
all, just call.&quot;

&quot;I think she likes you,&quot; Releena said with a laugh. Hilde just blushed,
so Releena picked up her bag and carried it into the bedroom, where she
promptly broke out with laughter again. Hilde wondered what was so
funny.

Hilde followed her in carrying the other bags, and groaned out loud.
The single bed was very large, very pink, and shaped like a giant
valentine&#39;s heart. &quot;Of course, Dorothy made sure to book us into the 
oneymoon suite. A quick death&#39;s too good for her, I swear,&quot; Hilde sighed
in mock despair, and made Releena laugh harder.

Releena then smiled wryly over at Hilde, and gently said, &quot;It should be
all right. The bed&#39;s large enough for both of us to share.&quot; Releena
looked thoughtful; &quot;You don&#39;t grind your teeth, roll over, or sleepwalk,
do you?&quot;

Hilde grinned, as she shook her head no, &quot;Duo never complained.&quot;

&quot;Good, it&#39;s settled.&quot; Releena said firmly.

Later that evening, they ate together in the main dining room, where
they noticed two very important things: the only guests of the hotel
were women, and the French maids flirted outrageously with everyone.
&quot;Think Dorothy knew what sort of hotel she was booking us into?&quot; Releena
asked Hilde with a quirky smile. She adjusted her dress uncomfortably,
noticing the cleavage it revealed. &#39;Yes, Dorothy has a lot to answer
for,&#39; Releena thought.

Hilde nodded, &quot;Knowing her, the answer is yes.&quot; She did cut a fine
figure in her suit, as many of the young women in the opulently
decorated room noticed. They shared a quiet laugh. One of the maids
cat-walked over on her high heels, and bent over to pour their wine,
in the process giving them each a generous view of her cleavage. Releena
noticed Hilde blushed very pinkly afterwards and fought the urge to
laugh. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Hilde said, a blush still visible on her cheeks. She shook
it off and smiled across the table at Releena. &quot;This will be one for the
memoirs,&quot; the young diplomat added.

Hilde grinned, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll put it in right after my secret marriage to
Releena Peacecraft, and our eloping together across Europe.&quot; Hilde
smiled warmly to her, &quot;I can&#39;t think of anyone better to do it with,
though.&quot;

Releena smiled back, even though she wasn&#39;t sure quite what to say to
that, so she left it alone. They quickly finished their meal and retired
for the night. And were immediately confronted by the problem of... the
Bed. &quot;Why don&#39;t you get ready for bed first,&quot; Releena suggested to
Hilde, &quot;them it&#39;ll be my turn.&quot;

&quot;It sound&#39;s like a plan,&quot; Hilde said, picked up some clothes and headed
for the bathroom. She quickly disrobed there, before she paused a moment
to look at herself in the mirror. &#39;Yes, I&#39;m still slim, small breasted
and I have no hips,&#39; Hilde thought, and made a funny face at herself in
the mirror. She pulled on a set of black silk PJs that Dorothy provided,
and stepped out of the bathroom.

Releena smiled up at Hilde as she passed by, and carried her own bundle
of stuff into the luxurious bathroom. She undressed, and sighed softly
in relief as she slipped out of her nearly skintight dress. She held up
the nightie Dorothy had packed for her, and she groaned softly. Releena
sighed, and put it on. She saw her reflection and stopped a moment,
making a glamour girl pose before breaking out in a case of giggles.
&#39;Marilyn Monroe, I&#39;m not,&#39; Releena thought with a smile.

Hilde gasped softly, as Releena stepped into the bedroom. The nightie
was a little piece of silky nothingness that mostly covered everything,
but just barely. Releena slid into the bed beside her, and Hilde gulped
softly. The bed was a large one, but somehow, Hilde turned and Releena
moved, and they were face to face. Releena&#39;s eyes were wide, like a
cat&#39;s, and Hilde could feel them peering into her soul.

Releena could hear the sound of their breathing as she reached out
tentatively, taking Hilde&#39;s shoulders into her hands. It almost felt
like she was falling, but where to Releena didn&#39;t know. They gently
moved closer, and Releena again felt the soft touch of Hilde&#39;s lips on
hers. Hilde&#39;s arms curled around her and Releena felt safe there as
they kissed again, hotly.

&quot;You know,&quot; Releena said softly, &quot;that Dorothy&#39;s been trying to set us
up?&quot;

Hilde nodded. &quot;If you don&#39;t want this to happen,&quot; Hilde said softly,
&quot;tell me now.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t stop,&quot; Releena said softly, blushing brightly. She looked up
into the young bodyguard&#146;s eyes, and finally said something she&#146;d said
to only two other people before, &quot;Hilde, I... I think I&#146;m falling in
love with you.&quot; Releena blushed harder, and tried to hide her face.

Hilde put her finger under Releena&#39;s chin, and tilted her face up. &quot;The
feeling the mutual, my Queen,&quot; Hilde said softly. She smiled suddenly,
&quot;You&#39;ve been driving me mad for days.&quot; She pulled Releena into her arms,
and then gently pulled the blankets up over them.



Releena stretched luxuriously, feeling warm, content and safe. She
realised she was naked, and looking around for her nightgown, eventually
spotted it lying on the floor. Right beside it was a rumpled set of
black silk PJs. She turned, and saw Hilde asleep peacefully beside her;
her short black hair stuck up in all directions. &#39;Hilde gets bed hair,&#39;
Releena thought fondly, &#39;I never realized.&#39; Hilde shifted a bit, then
her eyes opened. She unerringly found Releena, and smiled a slow,
contented smile. She sat up, then noticed she was topless. Unaccountably
shy, Hilde pulled the blanket over her chest.

&quot;Good morning, sleepy head,&quot; Releena said affectionately.

Hilde smiled shyly over to Releena then said softly &quot;I hope you know,
that wasn&#39;t just a one night thing.&quot;

&quot;I certainly hope not,&quot; Releena said, and gently put her hand on top of
Hilde&#39;s. &quot;I know it may be difficult, but I want to wake up every
morning with you.&quot;

Hilde smiled more comfortably, and firmly said, &quot;I&#39;ll do whatever I can
to make it happen.&quot; she grinned suddenly, &quot;We&#39;re already married, so...&quot;

Releena laughed softly, &quot;Why don&#39;t we let the marriage stand?&quot; She
chuckled softly, &quot;I can&#39;t wait to hear what Une will say.&quot;

Hilde got out of bed, and pulled on her PJs. &quot;I&#39;ll be back with
breakfast,&quot; Hilde said with a smile. She headed into the living room and
phoned down for room service. She clicked on the television, and froze.

&quot;... To repeat our top story, Preventer&#39;s headquarters was attacked this
evening. Casualties are unknown at this point, but the buildings
themselves are still aflame...&quot;</pre>
