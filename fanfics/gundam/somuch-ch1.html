<h1>So Much to Remember</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/poppy_chan.html">Poppy Chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Relena opened her eyes slowly, half wondering what she would see, half
afraid of what she would find. Fear won out, so she kept her eyes closed,
instead letting her hands feel about her. The first thing they came into
contact with was silk. The silk expanded out, laying on top and around her.
It was the smoothest fabric she ever felt rub against her bare skin. Silk
sheets, she finally decided. She then confirmed she was in a bed by the two
pillows stacked neatly beneath her head. Not exactly a brilliant discovery,
but now she knew she was in a bedroom, and that was some progress towards
figuring out where she was.

She put a hand to her forehead. Had she drunk last night? No, not enough to
affect her this much. There was only one thing she was sure of; a lot had
happened last night. So much had happened that it was taking awhile for her
to remember it all. No, not drunk, just so much to remember.

Images and sounds started to rush back to her. Laughter and music, drinks
and wonderful food. Yes, that&#39;s right, she had been to a party last night.
Not just any party, but her party, to celebrate peace. And the boys had been
there, for once happy and carefree. As carefree as Relena herself was. In
fact, she hadn&#39;t even bothered to be with Heero or try any of her usual
antics with him. In a way, she had felt tired that night. Like with the end
of the war was an end to a chapter of her life and the beginning of another.
It was time to let Heero go, move on, and wish him well.

She had approached him, yes, and he had even smiled at her. Then what.oh!
She had a surprise for him. She had dragged Duo all the way across the dance
floor by his braid. She tossed the braided boy at Heero and then skipped
away. She turned back only once to see the two boys on the dance floor,
having gotten her not-so-subtle message, and were dancing and whispering to
each other as they were always meant to.

Relena slowly sat up on the bed. Well, now she had ruled out both Heero&#39;s
and Duo&#39;s bed. Who else had she seen last night?

She had retreated to the bar, knowing she had done what was right but was
sad none the less. Wufei sat at the bar, Sally Po next to him, blushing as
she kept letting her hand cover his. Along with them were Quatre and Trowa,
both in a drunken stupor, making a rather adorable sight as Quatre curled up
in Trowa&#39;s lap, nuzzling and cuddling the brunet. Relena sat away from them,
alone, but content that everyone else was happy.

Relena let out a sigh. Well, that rules out four more people. Oh, and yes,
she was counting Sally Po. She had discovered that about herself a long time
ago. And from certain memories Relena was becoming more and more sure it was
a woman she had been with. Certain touches, caresses.yes, it had definitely
been a woman.

No matter how hard she tried she couldn&#39;t remember Dorothy being at the
party. Hilde.had Hilde been there? Yes, but she had been with other people,
only talking to Relena a few times during the night. Same with Lady Une. So.

A memory hit her. Navy hair. Flashing smile. A tall figure, complete with
long legs and curves. A deep blush spread across Relena&#39;s cheeks.

Lucrezia. Yes, Relena remembered now. Remembered whispering and screaming
that name throughout the night. A gentle kiss on the neck, fingers tracing
over her chest, a hand slipping down her thigh.

&quot;Lucrezia!&quot; Relena shouted, now all to aware she was alone in the room. She
opened her eyes, finally looking around to see where she was. The bed she
was in was large, the sheets made of beautiful white silk. Relena lay
underneath the sheets naked, and out of morning conservativeness pulled
them up to cover her chest.

She heard footsteps in the hallway, and in a few moments a tall figure
entered the room. Scantily clad in a white silk nightgown Lucrezia walked
towards her, smiling.

&quot;Good morning my love.&quot; Lucrezia whispered, her voice low and sultry. She
sat next to Relena, looking her up and down, amused to see the girl covering
her chest.

&quot;You know, I did see you naked last night.&quot; She commented with a smile.
Relena laughed a bit, happiness rushing back to her.

&quot;Its taken me a few minuets to remember everything that happened.&quot; Relena
admitted, studying her lovers features. Lucrezia nodded.

&quot;We had a long night.&quot; She said, leaning in and kissing Relena.

With that kiss the rest of the nights events flooded back to Relena. Relena
had had a few drinks, but not enough to really be drunk, and sat at the bar
alone. Lucrezia approached her, wearing the same uniform that she always
did. For the first time though, Relena noticed something about Lucrezia that
she had never seen before. A certain way she walked, moving quickly yet with
confidence, her long legs and long strides, hips swaying with each movement.
With the war behind her, her obsession for Heero Yuy finally gone, and a
chance to actually see things the way they were, Relena noticed how
beautiful this woman really was. Lucrezia, not Noin, the woman of duty and
honor, but the woman Lucrezia. And suddenly Relena realized how little she
truly appreciated her. How many times had Lucrezia protected her? Watched
over her? Too many times to count.

&quot;Lucrezia, I&#39;m so sorry.&quot; Relena cried as the woman approached her. Ever
protective, Lucrezia hurried over to her and wrapped her arms around her.
Relena continued to cry, so badly in fact that Lucrezia eventually wrapped
the girl up in her own coat and took her home, setting her down in her own
bed and finally got Relena to tell her what was wrong.

&quot;I&#39;ve never noticed how beautiful you are. I&#39;m so sorry.&quot; Relena said,
muffled still by her sobs. Lucrezia was stunned.

&quot;Is that why you&#39;re crying?&quot; she asked in disbelief. Relena shook her head.

&quot;No, I&#39;m crying because I&#39;ve never appreciated you the way I should have. I
never said thank you, never told you how great you are. And.what&#39;s worse,
you love my brother. You love him you love him you love him.&quot; Relena wailed,
sinking into Lucrezia&#39;s arms.

&quot;Relena, what are you saying?&quot; Lucrezia asked, holding the sobbing girl
close. Relena looked up.

&quot;Its taken me a long time because I&#39;ve been so naive, but you treat me so
well.I just love you so much Lucrezia.&quot; Relena sobbed, burying her head in
Lucrezia&#39;s neck.

&quot;In what way do you mean love, Relena?&quot; Lucrezia asked seriously. She looked
down just as Relena brought her lips up and kissed her. The kiss was gentle
and tasted of tears. Lucrezia unconsciously found her tong gently tracing
across Relena&#39;s lips to remove the tears from them. After a moment she
pulled away.

&quot;Are you drunk, Relena?&quot; she asked breathlessly. Relena shook her head.

&quot;I&#39;m a little tipsy, but sober enough to know that this is the right thing.
But you do love my brother, don&#39;t you?&quot; she asked sadly. Lucrezia hesitated.

&quot;Don&#39;t you love Heero Yuy?&quot; she asked instead.

&quot;I let go of him tonight.&quot; Relena said. &quot;I&#39;m starting over.&quot;

Lucrezia paused for a moment, then smiled.

&quot;Then maybe I&#39;ll let go of your brother tonight. Starting over sounds real
nice.&quot; She said, then gently pressed Relena back onto her bed. She lay
partially on top of her, kissing her gently one moment and hard the next.
The woman explored the sweet tastes inside the girls mouth, causing slight
moans to form in the back of the Relena&#39;s throat. Lucrezia pulled away,
elated and dizzy.

&quot;This is nice Relena, but we can only go so far tonight.&quot; she said.

&quot;Why?&quot; Relena asked angrily, trying to pull Lucrezia back. Lucrezia shook
her head.

&quot;I&#39;m older than you Relena, I don&#39;t want to take advantage of you.&quot; she
said.

&quot;Its not taking advantage if I want you to! I may be young but I&#39;m not a
fool anymore. Lucrezia, I&#39;ve grown a lot, I&#39;m ready.&quot; she pleaded, her body
writhing in impatience and excitement beneath the woman&#39;s figure. Lucrezia
gasped slightly as Relena let her hands travel over the woman&#39;s body,
showing the girls desperate need for this. Lucrezia conceded.

&quot;You always get your way.&quot; She muttered with a smile, leaning towards the
young girl. Her hand slipped underneath Relena&#39;s skirt, and in a few moments
some how managed to remove it. Lucrezia&#39;s hands traveled all around Relena&#39;s
body, removing whatever else remained. Relena now lay naked, sheer happiness
coursing through her as the silk sheets and Lucrezia&#39;s hands rubbed all over
her body. Lucrezia pressed her hand in between Relena&#39;s thighs, fingers
exploring. Relena moaned as Lucrezia&#39;s fingers traced over sensitive spots,
slowly pressing into her.

Relena in turn began to take Lucrezia&#39;s clothes off. A little wilder and
more impatient, she flung the garments off of her lover and eagerly touched
the skin that lay beneath. Relena slowly kissed Lucrezia&#39;s neck, but
suddenly found herself crying out as Lucrezia&#39;s fingers pressed harder and
deeper into her. Relena cried her lovers name, pleasure heightening by the
moment. The touches became more demanding and yet still insanely gentle.
Kisses found themselves traveling lower and lower, an ache that grew and
grew, and suddenly Relena sighed and moaned, panting, only to start back up
again by feeling her lover and letting the kisses travel even lower...

Relena was suddenly snapped back to the present as Lucrezia pulled away from
their kiss. She eyed Relena intently.

&quot;Do you regret what we did last night?&quot; she asked, although as she was
asking this her hand was slipping underneath of the sheets.

&quot;No.&quot; Relena whispered, then gasped a little as Lucrezia managed to tug the
sheet away from her grasp, exposing Relena&#39;s chest.

&quot;Good, because I love you Relena, and I will never regret last night.&quot;
Lucrezia whispered, her hand now tracing lower over Relena&#39;s body. Both
warmth and chills spread wherever her hand touched.

&quot;Where were you a moment ago?&quot; Relena asked, suddenly remembering that she
had woken up alone.

&quot;Making breakfast, but I think that can wait.&quot; She said as she crawled
underneath the sheets. Relena laughed.

&quot;I may always get my way, but you never get tired!&quot;

Author&#39;s note:

If you&#39;re all wondering about the word conservativeness and why you&#39;ve never
hear it before don&#39;t worry, your not the crazy one, I am. Its made up. I
couldn&#39;t think of another word so I made up my own! And did anyone notice
Lucrezia&#39;s gotta thing for white silk? Oh well, fetish I guess (tee hee).
Did you enjoy? Limey goodness or badness? If you actually read it all the
way through bonus karma points for you, but you gotta e-mail me for them ^_~
