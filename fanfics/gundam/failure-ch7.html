<h1>Failure of Vision (part 7 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rzrblade.html">Rzrblade33</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gundam/failure-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>His eyes are cobalt. That&#146;s what Miss Relena used to say to me 
constantly. She was in love with Heero&#146;s eyes, I&#146;m sure of it. And I 
listened intently to her discourse on his &#145;pools of cobalt wonder&#146; and 
all the other phrases she used - each of them with the word &#145;cobalt&#146; 
in them at least once.

Inwardly I was retching with contempt. Eyes aren&#146;t meant to be 
considered &#145;cobalt&#146;. No one could actually use such a word to describe 
eye color; they use blue and green and brown. She sounded like a 
nonsensical romance novel illustrating the main character from his 
future lover&#146;s viewpoint, which I suppose is what she considered 
herself to be.

I realize now how mistaken I was. His eyes can only be described as 
&#145;cobalt&#146;. I wouldn&#146;t use another word; I really don&#146;t think one exists 
that could be used in place of it.

His eyes are cobalt - purely and simply cobalt - and staring straight 
at me.

&#147;You think you&#146;re smart, don&#146;t you?&#148; Heero asks evenly. I&#146;m not sure 
how the two of us ended up here, alone on one of the many balconies of 
Miss Relena&#146;s house with Duo and Relena inside, probably mentally at 
each other&#146;s throat. He sought me out, I&#146;m sure, stalked me much like 
a predator would his prey.

&#147;I don&#146;t know what you mean.&#148;

His intent stare doesn&#146;t falter the slightest bit, his eyes still 
boring into mine. &#147;I can see right through you, Dorothy.&#148;

I clasp my hands behind my back and continue to hold his gaze. &#147;Can 
you?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;And what exactly can you see?&#148;

I wait for his reply but it never comes. He blinks at me 
contemplatively and finally looks away, inducing a tiny sigh of relief 
from me as at last I am able to shift feet without seeming nervous.

We both stand in silence, turned towards the setting sun, although I 
don&#146;t believe either of us is truly watching the spectacle of nature. 
We&#146;re lost in our own thoughts.

Heero is the first to break the silence. His voice is quiet and 
displays more emotion that I&#146;ve ever heard from him before - which is 
still fairly monotone. &#147;I&#146;ll be leaving in a few weeks.&#148;

My head snaps up. &#147;What?&#148; He can&#146;t mean what I think he means. He 
can&#146;t be quitting.

&#147;I&#146;m leaving,&#148; he repeats, still not looking at me. His body is rigid 
and his expression emotionless. 

It is almost like a movie. One lover is leaving. The other wants to 
know why. Except we aren&#146;t lovers, and my reasoning is much different 
from a love-struck woman. Much different.

&#147;You&#146;re leaving?&#148; My mouth gapes open. &#147;And you&#146;re not coming back?&#148; 
He gives a curt nod. &#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;I feel that I have to,&#148; is his reply, not giving an inch. But I can 
hear the unspoken words.

&#147;Because of Duo.&#148; Not a question, a statement.

Heero doesn&#146;t answer, only continues to stare impassively ahead. The 
silence speaks for itself, and I look away, plainly disgusted by his 
wordless admission. Love, such a trivial emotion.

I am faintly surprised at my distress. What do I care if he leaves? 
It&#146;s hardly my business. Besides, it will crush Relena. She&#146;s still 
hopelessly smitten - despite her protests. She will be torn, broken. 
She&#146;ll cry millions of deliciously salty tears each day that will need 
to be licked away.

&#147;What about Miss Relena?&#148; I ask, glancing at him briefly before 
returning to the pinks and purples of the sky.

&#147;She&#146;ll be all right. I haven&#146;t told her yet, but I&#146;m sure that she&#146;ll 
take it fairly well,&#148; he says calmly.

I wonder if he knows what he&#146;s saying or if maybe I&#146;ve misconstrued 
him once again. Perhaps he still has no idea that he is tormenting 
her, causing her so much exquisite pain. Maybe he is as oblivious as I 
first assumed him to be.

&#147;After all,&#148; he continues, turning to fully face me again, &#147;she has 
you.&#148;

Then he&#146;s gone, leaving me in the rapidly cooling breeze and the 
suddenly black sunset.
