<h1>Intertwined (part 5 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kimmie.html">Kimmie</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gundam/inter-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;Lucrezia?&quot; I mumble her name as I feel her slide out of the large 
sleeping bag we made by zipping two together.

She laughs. It&#39;s mellifluous, even when it&#39;s barely dawn. &quot;Yeah, Relena? 
I was just going to start on the coffee.&quot;

It&#39;s things like that which make me entirely happy to be with her. Noin, 
my dear sweet wonderful Noin, hates coffee. Yet, she learned how to make 
it for me. For some reason, I can&#39;t make a good pot of coffee. She could 
make coffee with a cup of lemon juice and a copy of Whistler&#39;s Mother, I 
think. And, it would still taste like how coffee should taste.

Then again, perhaps it makes it better that she made it? 

I see her shiver in the cold morning air, the tips of her socks darkened 
by the dew on the grass. The fire that we meticulously made last night, 
if throwing pine needles and cones at one another and having them happen 
to fall in the blaze can be called that, is down to smoldering coals. 
Noin grabs for some pine needles, a small stick... several items that I 
don&#39;t normally see... and somehow manages to bring the fire up to a 
decent level in only a few moments.

I don&#39;t know how she does it. She just... does. Every little thing she 
does amazes me. I want to be a part of it forever. I realize that now. I 
want to be there for her in four months, when she has a cold, to make 
chicken soup. I want to be there in two years when some relative dies 
and she wants a shoulder to cry on. I want to be there in ten years when 
life is beginning to feel like it&#39;s too much. I want to be there forever 
when she&#39;s there.

Somehow it all happened... somehow, I fell in love. I use that word so 
easily with her. Love. Love....

If the phrasing of love comes so easily, outside and within, does that 
mean it&#39;s true? Because I can say &quot;Lucrezia, I love you,&quot; does that mean 
that if she feels the same, we could have forever... always? And, if I 
stood up right now and walked over to her and kissed her, what would she 
say?

That last question intrigues me. So, I slide from the sleeping bag and 
stumble over rocks and damp grass over to her. She glances at me and 
smiles, and I kiss her lightly. She returns it, a stirring spoon in one 
hand, then pulls back and tucks a bit of hair behind my ear. &quot;Mmm... 
Love you too, Relena.&quot; Good. She knows.

She knows that I love her. That must mean it&#39;s true. And, she loves me 
too. I can&#39;t say for certain that I know it&#39;s true, but it feels right. 
And, anything that feels this right simply must be! Or, why are we 
bothering to fool ourselves?

Someday, I&#39;m going to sit back and review my life. I&#39;ll think of how my 
family went to ruins, how my adopted father told me of my real life and 
then died, how I fell in curiousty with a boy named Heero Yuy, how I was 
Queen of the World, and I won&#39;t regret much about it. But, all 
throughout it, I want to think of her.

I want to memorize the way she holds her lips when she smiles. I want to 
know exactly which pieces of hair fall on her face and how often she&#39;ll 
allow me to stroke them back just so I can giggle like a schoolgirl 
because I got to touch *her*. I want to be obsessed with her because I 
know her so well, not because I hardly know her at all.

I&#39;m so lucky to have found love. I thought I never would. I thought that 
perhaps I wasn&#39;t capable of loving. And then she taught me not to think 
so much.

My coffee is ready now. She&#39;s got herself a cup of tea. I&#39;ve got myself 
a wonderful person who can make me enjoy doing things that I never 
thought I would do.

Perhaps if I can get her to stick around, I&#39;ll try a lot of new things. 
This is, in itself, a new thing.

I look up to see her gazing at me shyly over the brim of her mug. I 
smile at her. &quot;Thanks for the coffee. It&#39;s really good, as always.&quot;

She only nods and blows lightly at her tea, trying to cool it down.

I think I like new things.
