<h1>Valkyrie (part 9 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/twig.html">Twig</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gundam/valkyrie-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>	The next three days went by like a blur, moving so quickly that
Relena felt she was living the same day over and over, just at a faster
speed every hour.

	Quatre sat at her side through the seemingly endless tribunal,
through argument after argument over whether the mining satellite had
/any/ possible reason to fire on an unarmed space station.  

The Gundam pilot had always seemed a bit too naive for his own good, but
Relena was the first one to admit that he understood more about asteroids,
natural resources and mineral rights than anyone she had ever known.

-----------------------------

	&quot;This doesn&#39;t make sense.&quot;

	&quot;Mm... what doesn&#39;t?&quot;

	Relena was eating her lunch while looking over the trajectory
reports of the attack, and the transcripts of what had been the station&#39;s
highest-ranking officials, the people responsible for trying to keep the
space station together in the last few desperate minutes.

	There were a lot of epitaphs, prayers in a handful of languages,
and more passages marked &lt;unintelligible due to background noise&gt; than
Relena cared to think about.

	//Background noise... that means screaming.  The screams of people
who have nowhere to go, who know they&#39;re going to die.//
	
She put down the small container of white rice, the only thing she had
been able to keep down for the past day or so, looking up at Quatre as she
took a sip of water.

	&quot;What doesn&#39;t make sense, Quatre?&quot;

	&quot;These reports, for shipments made from the colony to the-&quot; 
Quatre paused, flipping back and forth between the papers.  &quot;It doesn&#39;t
even say where they&#39;re going.  All those pages are missing.&quot;

	&quot;Missing?&quot;

	&quot;Mm-hm.&quot;  Quatre kept looking, making small puzzled noises from
time to time, chewing on the end of a pen cap.	

Relena kept searching for answers, but all she could see was a paper trail
that led to the remains of a civilian station. There was, at the most, the
most minimal of cover-ups by the mining station, to make it look like an
accident, a panicked reaction to a system error, a false alarm.

//What are they hiding?  Or are they just trying to make absolutely sure
it looked like an accident, so no one gets angry.//
	
&quot;This isn&#39;t right, this isn&#39;t right at all.&quot;
  
	Quatre set the papers on the table, staring at her with an
unusually serious expression.
	
&quot;There&#39;s no way the ore they&#39;re mining weighs this much, not with the
numbers they&#39;ve listed.  If you calculate it out, they&#39;re all off... by
quite a lot.&quot;

	Relena nodded, and added mining to the never-ending list of things
she had to learn more about.  She knew a little, but not nearly enough.

	&quot;Aren&#39;t they usually weighed in on a rounded-off number anyway? 
It would be impossible to get an exact count.&quot;

	Quatre shook his head.

	&quot;That&#39;s what I thought at first, too... but even with the highest
error, at least the largest margin our company uses, these are still /way/
off.&quot;

	&quot;What does that mean, then?  What could that mean?&quot;

 Relena reached into her pocket, pulled out two more extra strength pain
relievers, and swallowed them dry, wishing she had something strong to
wash them down with.

	//Yeah... like cyanide.//

	Quatre kept reading, and the brunette could actually watch his
eyes darken, feel things getting more serious, as if the room were
changing temperature.  Her optimism dropped as the moments passed
silently.  

The blonde finally looked up at her, a frown on his face and a
half-guarded look in his eyes.

	&quot;Relena, um...&quot;
	
The brunette shook her head, unwilling to wait for him to think of a
pleasant way to break the news.
	
&quot;Let&#39;s have it, Quatre.  What are we going to have to present to them next
meeting.&quot;
	
&quot;Well, it looks like... with these ores, and the trading schedules.  Um,
some of the things the colony was shipping in, in such small amounts,
through the back door...&quot;

	&quot;Our ally in peace was producing-?&quot;

	&quot;Weapons.  Lots of weapons.&quot;  Quatre sighed.  &quot;It looks like the
mining station was in on the whole thing, and decided to blow the station
when a few of the Sank kingdom representatives stopped there for a
vacation.&quot;

	&quot;A vacation.&quot; Relena laughed bitterly, and it felt like a mass of
pebbles had lodged in her throat.  &quot;That sounds about right, that&#39;s about
the kind of luck the Sank seems to have these days.&quot;
	
&quot;Hey there... and I thought leaders like you didn&#39;t believe in luck!&quot;
	
Relena turned, and saw two familiar figures standing in the doorway.  The
one who had spoken was leaning against the frame, his long braid trailing
behind him.
	
&quot;Duo! Trowa!&quot;
	
Relena almost winced at the way Quatre&#39;s voice changed when he saw the
person standing behind the grinning pilot.
	
//For God sakes, Quatre, the least you could do is act like you&#39;re not
completely smitten.  Play a /little/ hard to get.//
	
&quot;Hello, Miss Relena.  I hope you&#39;re well.&quot;
	
The thin, soft-eyed pilot was as quiet as always, a perfect counterpoint
to Quatre&#39;s barely controlled excitement.  As she watched the blonde&#39;s
face light up, Relena wondered if the feelings were mutual between them,
if Trowa knew what Quatre felt, and felt the same.
	
//I hope so. I really do. Everyone deserves to be happy.//
	
&quot;I&#39;m still alive, Trowa, and that&#39;s about all I can ask for right now. 
It&#39;s good to see you two again.&quot;  She paused, looking over Duo&#39;s shoulder.
 &quot;Where&#39;s Hilde?&quot;
	
&quot;Aw, she&#39;s not here.  She had - I dunno, something she had to do on a
colony somewhere.&quot; 

	Duo shrugged, trying to act casual, and completely failing at it. 
There was an unspoken agreement between them, she knew.  Relena didn&#39;t
ever ask what Duo and Hilde did for a living when the pilots were away. 
She had a pretty good idea, and couldn&#39;t really fault either of them for
it.

	//Knowing Duo, they&#39;re probably mercenaries.  Hell, maybe I /am/
wrong about this whole peace business... maybe /that&#39;s/ the way the world
should be.  People fighting and killing and dying and absolutely loving
it, just like Duo does.  I mean, it&#39;s the second best thing to peace, as
far as I can see, enjoyable war.  Absolute Duoism.//

	&quot;You&#39;re still a horrible liar, Duo.&quot;  Relena crossed her arms. 
&quot;It&#39;s good to see you.	What are you boys up to, then?&quot;

	Duo grinned.

	&quot;I just thought we&#39;d drop by and pick up our friend Quatre here,
go out, see the town, put a little hair on his chest.&quot;

	If anyone could talk their way both in and out of trouble, Relena
knew Duo was the one to do it.	The brunette had never gone out partying
with him, but knew it had to be an experience to last a lifetime.  The
disparity between the grin on the braided pilot&#39;s face and Quatre&#39;s look
of dread and horror made her laugh.

	&quot;You go on ahead then, Quatre.	I&#39;ll finish up the primary data
here.&quot; 

She said it partly to watch him flinch, and try to protest before Duo
dragged him away, and partly because watching the other Gundam pilot&#39;s
happiness, his manic glee, had suddenly made her horribly sad.
	
&quot;Relena, do you want to join us?&quot;
	
Trowa&#39;s voice was as soft as the earnest concern in his eyes, and the note
of worry she heard in that light tenor nearly made her burst into tears. 
Relena could feel the sadness welling up inside of her, a demon she never
seemed to be able to slay.
	
&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot;
 
Relena coughed, and slammed down hard on the ache of sorrow in her chest. 
&quot;Things are kind of busy here, and... well, there&#39;s always them.&quot;  

	Relena pointed towards two soldiers, standing in full view at the
other end of the hall.

	&quot;Things are kind of crazy here.  I think Zechs has grounded me for
a while.  I&#39;m kind of a security risk.&quot;

	&quot;Ah.&quot;

--------------------------

	Trowa&#39;s eyes widened as Relena&#39;s still-pointing hand started to
tremble lightly.  He followed her gaze across the room, to where Dorothy
appeared, her blonde hair flaring with light as she stepped into a
sunbeam.  The girl was looking back at them, or more specifically, at
Relena.

	&quot;I... I have to go, Trowa.  It was great to see you.  Have fun
with Duo and Quatre.&quot;

	&quot;Relena?&quot;

	Before he could turn to question her, Relena had fled back into
the study room, and shut the door firmly behind her.  Trowa turned, and
watched as Dorothy, with an uncharacteristic look of sadness on her face,
took a step towards him, and the door at his back.  Almost immediately,
the soldiers stepped from the wall, one of them grabbing her shoulder. 
They conversed in a low tone for a few moments, and with one final, almost
desperate look, Dorothy walked back the way she had come.

	//That&#39;s strange.  Very strange, I wonder what-//

	&quot;Trowa!  Move your big-banged butt, boy! The beer is not going to
drink itself!&quot;

	The brown-haired pilot sighed, knowing answers would be impossible
to find tonight even if he stayed, and reminded himself to find out what
was going on as he walked out to the car, where Quatre and the impatient
Duo were waiting for him.

-------------------------

	&quot;Ugh...&quot;

	Quatre stumbled into the sunroom the next morning, wearing a pair
of fresh-pressed clothes that looked much better than he did.  He blinked
blearily at the sunlight, grumbling to himself. Relena got up, trying to
move as quietly as she could, and closed the blinds.

	&quot;Thanks, Relena.&quot;

	She watched him amble across the floor, rubbing at his eyes,
swearing under his breath as he walked right into the coffee table.
	
&quot;What /did/ Duo do to you last night?	
	
The blonde boy had come home very early that morning, and the shower and
sleep seemed to have done little to help his hung over condition.

	&quot;Nothing... all that important.  We just went out to a party... or
two, or three.	Something like that.&quot;
	
Relena&#39;s eyes suddenly danced with mischief.
	
&quot;Well then, what did Trowa do to you last night?&quot;
	
/That/ got a reaction.	Quatre stood straight up, eyes wide as he stared
at her, and then he blushed a brilliant red, blinking at her and
spluttering like some kind of broken machine.
	
&quot;It&#39;s all right, Quatre.&quot; She smirked in an airy tone.	&quot;It&#39;s not like
it&#39;s any of my business.&quot;
	
Relena stuck her fork in the plain white rice she had been eating, moving
a few grains around for a moment, before abandoning the idea entirely. 
Her stomach and head were fighting for top rank among things that ached in
her body.  Right now, her stomach was winning.

	&quot;Did you get any sleep last night, Relena?&quot;

	Quatre looked at her worriedly, and the brunette was glad she
could smile, and alleviate his worries.

	&quot;Yeah.	We just had some... tourists.&quot;
	
&quot;Tourists?!&quot;
	
&quot;I&#39;m not kidding.  They showed up just after you left.	Zechs almost went
ballistic.  Noin had to keep him from interrogating them right at the
door.  He thought they were spies or something,  but they were just lost
tourists, with a really bad map.  I don&#39;t even know what they were
speaking, but it took an hour to find an interpreter.&quot;	

Relena grinned, delighted by the absurdity of it all.
	
&quot;Tourists, at a time like this...&quot;

	She was a bit annoyed, because despite all her cheer, Quatre still
seemed sad, and worried about her.

&quot;You should really come out with us, when we go to a party again.  We had
fun, we met a lot of nice people.&quot;  The blonde looked around.  &quot;I don&#39;t
think... you can&#39;t get that kind of perspective around here.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah.	Maybe...&quot; Relena leaned back in her chair.  &quot;So, what are
you going to do with your day off?&quot;
	
&quot;Day off?&quot;
	
&quot;Mm-hmm.&quot;  Relena stretched all the way out, until her fingertips were
pointed towards the ceiling and her toes were almost horizontal with the
floor, feeling several muscles protest as she did so.  
	
&quot;The mineral workers got real scared when Zechs presented them with the
evidence that they were making arms.  Some of them went back to the plant,
and the ones that stayed here aren&#39;t talking much.&quot;
	
Relena sighed, feeling her face crumple into a worried frown.
	
&quot;Something&#39;s going on with the border war, too. I don&#39;t know... they&#39;re
being quiet about it, but both sides just packed up and left, late last
night, with no explanation.&quot;

	&quot;Did Noin or Zechs say anything?&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s a bit of a secret, but I think they&#39;re actually out there
right now, trying to find out what&#39;s going on.	One of the rumors is, both
sides could team up, and try to attack the Sank.&quot;

	&quot;Really.&quot;

	&quot;Mm-hm.&quot; Relena looked up as someone cleared their throat,
standing at the outer entrance of the room.

	&quot;Trowa!&quot;

	Relena stifled a giggle as Quatre winced at the sound of his own
chirpy cry.  Trowa looked none the worse for wear from last night&#39;s
adventures, padded softly into the room on bare feet.

	&quot;Good morning!&quot;

	The brown-haired boy didn&#39;t stop moving, and stepped right into
Quatre&#39;s arms, gently kissed him hello.  Quatre&#39;s eyes widened, flicking
from the boy to Relena, and he started glowing like a giant red light
bulb.

	&quot;That&#39;s my cue.&quot;  Relena laughed, scrambling out of her chair,
surprised by how sad she was, making sure not to let on.

	//So now you can handle sadness, you can handle endless debate and
war and death, but happiness makes you uncomfortable - is that it?// 

	That /was/ it.	Seeing Trowa and Quatre together threw a wrench
into the machine of her will, her devotion to the kingdom, the motivation
that kept her going everyday.  Seeing that honest affection reminded her
too much... of too many things.  Of Heero, who had never returned her
love, and of Dorothy - who very much might have.

	//It wasn&#39;t enough.  Not even close.  I barely got to understand
what I was feeling, and then you were gone.//

	&quot;Relena.  Please, wait.  I need to talk to you, it&#39;s important.&quot;
  
	She could see it in his eyes, that Trowa wanted to talk about her,
wanted to know what was wrong.	It was too much, and Relena knew she
wouldn&#39;t make it through the conversation without bursting into tears.

	&quot;It can w-wait.  Really, Trowa, lets wait until the afternoon, ok?
 Have a good morning - you too, Quatre!&quot;

--------------------------

	Relena hurried away before they could stop her, and didn&#39;t look
back, almost running down the stairs and through the empty corridors.

Since all meetings had been canceled, the only people around were the
ever-present guards.  The sight of them was an oppressive cloud over an
otherwise pleasant day for her.  Relena wondered if there was a way to get
rid of them, somewhere she could go to be free.
	
As she passed an open door leading outside, a hand closed around her wrist
for the briefest of moments.

	&quot;Hello, Relena.&quot;

	Relena gasped in surprise, the entire world screeching to a halt,
and turned just in time to see a flick of blonde hair vanish behind a
hedge.

	//The hedge maze? Dorothy...//

	Relena stepped into the garden, inhaling deeply, the power of a
thousand flowers all opening into the morning air made for a heady perfume
that turned the air into a sea of delicious aromas.

	&quot;Dorothy?&quot;

	Relena tried not to speak too loudly, trying to give nothing away,
and smiled despite herself, as she heard the barest hint of laughter from
the bushes.  

	She stepped into the maze, knowing full well that she could be
walking into a trap.  That at any moment Dorothy could kill her, or
someone else could, or any number of other horrible things could happen.

	//I don&#39;t care. the grass is so green, the sky is so blue. 
Everything is alive and happy.	If I have to die, let it be now.  I don&#39;t
want to go back.  I won&#39;t mind at all, even if she&#39;s the one to kill me.//


	Relena followed the sound of Dorothy&#39;s laughter, sometimes
hurrying fast enough to catch the barest sight of a skirt, or a flash of
blonde amidst the green.  More than once, she found herself at a dead end,
but the laughter, the voice that whispered her name brought her around,
took her back to the right path.

	The brunette knew it was wrong to play games like this, knew it
wasn&#39;t safe, but it was the first time her heart had felt free, felt as if
it was soaring unchained since...

	//Since the last time I was with you, Dorothy.	I am so stupid. 
So, so stupid, just look what you&#39;ve done to me.//

	It was horrible and wonderful all at once, because Relena knew she
was doomed if she kept going, and yet couldn&#39;t make herself stop, only
moved faster. She reached the center of the maze and found no surprises,
only a blonde-haired beauty waiting for her, arms folded, blue-gray eyes
matching a sly, sweet smile.

	&quot;You caught me, Relena.  So, what do you want for a prize?&quot;
	
//You.	Me.  A way out of all of this.//

	A bittersweet thrill filled her senses, and the entire world paled
in contrast with the joy she felt inside.  Relena was caught between
worlds, between her heart and her logic, and couldn&#39;t speak.
	
&quot;Would you like to go out for a picnic lunch?  It&#39;s a beautiful day. 
Everyone&#39;s outside enjoying the sunshine. I think we should do the same. 
Unless you&#39;d rather not, Relena?&quot;

	The brown-haired girl nodded dumbly, almost entranced, and
followed behind Dorothy as the girl led her out of the maze, down the
green hills in front of the mansion, and out the front gate.  The guards
that should have been watching the grounds were occupied elsewhere, just
as Dorothy had ordered them to be, and no one ever saw the two girls
leave.

---------------------------

	Relena gaped when she saw the picnic spread, amazed at its
conceit, the directness of the trap.
 
They had walked for a long time through the woods, past a few open fields,
over small brooks and down long, winding paths between the trees, before
they reached the clearing where Dorothy had prepared her surprise.

	As the blonde-haired girl sat down, Relena could only shake her
head, almost laughing at the obvious ploy.

	&quot;This is such a setup.	Oh my god, Dorothy.  You didn&#39;t even try
to hide it, did you?&quot;

	&quot;Setup, Relena?&quot;

	Relena sat down, sure that there was already no way out of this,
not now that she was this far away from the mansion.

	//If you knew this was a trap, then why did you come?  Why did you
follow her all the way out here?//

	&quot;This is insane.  All of this... I know you didn&#39;t do this for
kindness&#39; sake.  This is some sort of ploy.&quot;

	&quot;You were always so smart, Relena.&quot;  Dorothy calmly poured out two
cups of tea, and began to unwrap sandwiches from a picnic basket that was
holding down the left edge of the blanket.

	&quot;Of course this was all planned.  I had to bribe the guards to
look the other way while I got you out of the mansion. I only had about an
hour window, until Noin and Zechs would get back, to get us far enough
away for a pleasant picnic.  There /was/ that butler of yours...&quot;

	Relena&#39;s breath caught in her throat, until Dorothy saw the look
on her face, and laughed.

	&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Relena.  I told one of the maids to tell him you
were in desperate need of - how did I put it? &#39;The special thing that
always makes me feel better.&#39; - Apparently, he took right off.	What /is/
that special thing, Relena?&quot;

	&quot;Strawberry ice cream, with caramel sauce.&quot; Relena murmured,
couldn&#39;t help but grin.  Without warning, she flopped down on the blanket,
staring up into the sky, laughing.  It was just too crazy, a stranger and
more dangerous situation than she could handle right now.  The brunette
looked up into the blue sky, and hollered the first thing she could think,
already laughing at the absurdity, the bitter irony of it.

	&quot;Heero!  Come back and kill me!  Please!  I mean it this time!!!&quot;

	Her breath caught in her throat as a face suddenly loomed over
her, and Dorothy was smiling brightly, her blue-gray eyes filled with an
intense joy almost bordering on pain.

	&quot;Are you that sad, Relena?  Are things so very difficult?&quot;

	Relena froze, and turned her eyes away, refusing to acknowledge
the lurch of pain in her stomach.  She curled up on her side for a moment,
trying to answer the blonde girl as truthfully as she could.

	&quot;I hurt, Dorothy.  I have headaches now, and stomachaches... and
my heart - it hurts, from nightmares and everything else.  I don&#39;t think I
can do what they want me to do.  I don&#39;t think I can lead the Sank kingdom
into a future of peace.&quot;

She sat up, staring at Dorothy in frustrated anger.

&quot;Do you know, none of the conflicts we&#39;ve dealt with these past few weeks
are connected in /any/ way?  No matter how many we solve, there&#39;s always a
thousand more waiting at the door.&quot; 

	As if she didn&#39;t realize who she was talking to, Relena suddenly
blinked, and looked at Dorothy, resignation in her eyes and voice.

	&quot;I don&#39;t know why we&#39;re talking. You don&#39;t care.  My brother. He -
he showed me your file. It was the night that we kissed.&quot;

Relena shook her head, staring at the blanket underneath her hand.  

&quot;I know who you are, Dorothy Catalonia.  I know what kind of person you
are.&quot;
	
&quot;Do you think I&#39;m dangerous now, Relena?&quot;
	
&quot;I never doubted it, not since the day we met.&quot;  Relena folded her arm
over her stomach, as the pain intensified, stabbing at her like a knife.  


&quot;I just wish I knew why you lied to me.&quot;

-------------------------

&quot;I didn&#39;t lie, Relena.&quot;

	Relena simply looked at her, gaze radiating sarcasm, but she
didn&#39;t have the energy to argue.  Dorothy sighed, shaking her head.
	
&quot;What did you read in that file, Relena?  You read about the life of a
girl who had been brought up as a spy, who had been bred for espionage and
conspiracy - in a way, raised to lead people, just as you were.&quot;

	Dorothy kept her voice calm, even though Relena flinched.
	
&quot;You read about someone who subtly moves through life, working as an
invisible influence.  That&#39;s me, but that&#39;s also not me.&quot;
	
The blonde smiled, resisting the urge to stroke Relena&#39;s cheek, run her
hands through the girl&#39;s long, brown hair.  To kiss... and be kissed.

	//Not yet, not yet.//	   

	&quot;They told me to come here.  They told me to be nice to you.  They
didn&#39;t tell me to argue, to make it so obvious who I was and why I was
here.  They told me to be your friend, if I could, and not to make you
question my every intention.  And they didn&#39;t tell me to fall in love with
you.&quot;

	Relena jerked as if she had been shocked, almost gasping for air. 
Dorothy sat back, giving her room, daintily picking up half of a sandwich,
and pouring some more tea.

	&quot;Have some food, Relena.  You look a little pale.&quot;

	Relena numbly took what she was offered, nibbled on the sandwich
before setting it aside, sipping the tea silently, just staring at the
blonde.

	&quot;You want to talk about war, Relena?  We could debate the benefits
of battle.  I bet you&#39;d feel better after a good argument.&quot;
	
&quot;More tea.&quot; Relena said in a low voice, not noticing the way Dorothy&#39;s
eyes widened, and her hands shook as she took up the teapot.

	//Too much, too fast.  You moron.  Too much said all at once, and
she won&#39;t believe it. Dorothy...  You&#39;ve lost her.  You said too much,
you&#39;ve pushed her too far.//

	The blonde was so immersed in her own feelings, she failed to
notice the spark of pure joy in Relena&#39;s eyes.

	&quot;There&#39;s no point in arguing about war, Dorothy.  Why tire
yourself out, when we both know I&#39;m right?&quot;

	Dorothy paused, utterly astonished, and realized that the brunette
was smiling at her.  After a moment, she grinned back. 

	&quot;You&#39;re so wise, Relena.  If only everyone in the world could be
like you, a world full of idealists and dreamers.&quot;

	&quot;No, not me.&quot;
  
The happy mood was broken.  Relena stirred another lump of sugar into her
tea, and drank almost all of it in one gulp.  

&quot;I&#39;m too tired to dream anymore.&quot;
	
Dorothy frowned, and sighed.
	
&quot;No one should be allowed to make you sad, Relena.  I hate to see it. 
It&#39;s like a battle gone completely wrong.&quot;

	Relena laughed.
	
&quot;Not that old song again, battle girl.&quot;  

She paused, and looked at the blonde for another moment.  Some
unfathomable emotion passed through her eyes.

&quot;Why couldn&#39;t Zechs just get rid of you when I still hated you?&quot;
	
Relena had never seen Dorothy&#39;s smile wider than it was at that moment.

	&quot;You never hated me.&quot;

	&quot;No.&quot; Relena smiled back. &quot;I never did.&quot;

	They sipped their tea for a little longer, before the blonde spoke
again.

	&quot;So, Zechs is going to get rid of me, then?&quot;

	Relena chuckled, but it was a bitter sound.

	&quot;He&#39;s trying to get rid of /me/.  Move the Sank kingdom&#39;s
leadership to space, so he can cut down on the number of people he has to
worry about, the possible dangers, the people who can get close to me.&quot;

	Relena didn&#39;t notice how frightened Dorothy looked by that, how
dark her blue eyes became.

	&quot;He&#39;ll isolate you from the world, if you let him.&quot;

	&quot;I...&quot; Relena blinked, yawning.  &quot;I know that.&quot;

---------------------------

A rumble interrupted their conversation.  Relena looked up, to see that
the sky was slowly filling with rolling gray clouds.  The brunette was
puzzled, because Dorothy was smiling.

//Why would she smile at the thunder?//
	
&quot;I - I&#39;d better be getting back, before the storm...&quot;

	Relena blinked, realizing that the food, even such a small amount
of it, must have been too much for her.  It was weighing heavily on her
system, she was suddenly very tired.  As she took one more sip of tea,
Relena found it was difficult to even keep her eyes open.

	//So dizzy... head&#39;s spinning...//

	&quot;Relena?&quot;  A soft hand gently slid around her empty teacup, which
the brunette realized she had been about to drop.

	&quot;Relena?  Are you all right?&quot;

	Relena nodded slowly.  Her head felt heavy, it seemed as if she
were moving through water each time she shifted on the picnic blanket. 
Another rumble of thunder came up, closer this time, and Relena felt a
surge of panic that faltered, and died, as she realized she couldn&#39;t
remember what was so important.

	//I have to get back - but where... and why?//

	&quot;Come on, Relena.  Let&#39;s go.&quot;

	There was something wrong with the hands that helped her stand,
started supporting her as they walked across the grass.  There was
something wrong, but Relena didn&#39;t know what it was.  They were helpful,
kind hands, as far as she could tell, especially because Relena felt very
clumsy. Her knees were weak, everything, even blinking, seemed to be a
tremendous effort.

	//Sleepy.  I&#39;m so sleepy...//
	
&quot;We&#39;re almost there, Relena.&quot;
	
Relena looked up dully, saw Dorothy&#39;s car parked in an out of the way spot
beneath some trees, where it would not be visible from the road.  

	&quot;It&#39;s The Car,&quot; she murmured.  There was no other way to describe
it, Dorothy&#39;s yellow behemoth.	It was simply &quot;The Car.&quot;

&quot;Hello, The Car.&quot;  

Relena&#39;s tongue felt thick and heavy in her mouth, it was as difficult to
speak as it was to walk. She felt a slight thrill run down her spine as
Dorothy chuckled right in her ear, pulled her a little closer.	The
brunette could feel the other girl&#39;s body close to her own, those hands on
her waist and shoulders holding her tight. She could see the blonde&#39;s
smile so well, this close up.

//Danger in that smile.  Dangerous, but Dorothy&#39;s not dangerous... is
she?//

Relena tried to stop moving, but found she could only slow the other girl
down slightly.	Her body didn&#39;t seem to want to follow orders.

&quot;Wait. Dorothy, wait.  Why is The Car here?  Didn&#39;t we... I thought we
walked?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right, Relena.  Hurry and get in, before the rain comes.&quot;

Relena slid into the passenger seat with Dorothy&#39;s help, the smooth
leather and plush seat were incredibly comfortable, allowing her to
finally relax completely.
	
//Nothing hurts.  Head, stomach - nothing hurts anymore.//

	The brown-haired girl smiled in sleepy, innocent delight as
Dorothy slid into the driver&#39;s seat, and her smile only brightened as the
blonde returned it wholeheartedly.

	Dorothy started to drive, and soon was immersed, completely
focused on the road, staring straight ahead, almost unblinkingly vigilant.
 

Dimly, Relena sensed that the blonde was nervous and tense, and thought it
was strange that the girl would be so concerned with driving, when it had
never bothered her before.

	Soon, the brunette found herself inexorably drifting into a deep
sleep, lulled by the gentle sway of the car moving down the road, and the
sound of rain on the roof.  

	//...and Dorothy, next to me.  Always.	Always... Dorothy.//

Relena smiled, aware of a feeling inside of her now, one that usually
managed to get lost when she was awake and alert, a wonderful feeling...
love.  She snuggled back against the seat, wrapped in warmth, comfort and
contentment, and fell into a deep slumber.

----------------------

It took forty-five minutes for Dorothy to stop watching the rear-view
mirror, expecting to see two or three large, angry Gundams behind her at
any minute.

//I thought... I was sure it was a trap.  One of Zechs&#39; strategies, a way
to see if I&#39;d take the bait.//

At first, it had seemed like it could only be a trap, to lure Dorothy into
doing something rash by leaving Relena in the open, by taking all other
obstacles away.

//Just the guards and that butler to protect her.  I can&#39;t believe I got
away with it.//

It had all gone like clockwork.  The pallid, almost sickly Relena had
followed her from the garden to the picnic without any hesitation.

//Some of that eagerness... was because you knew I might try to kill you,
and you didn&#39;t care anymore.  I&#39;m so sorry I waited, no matter what my
reason for it.//

Dorothy knew she had to try her plan despite the danger, and once Relena
had told her of Zechs&#39; idea, to relocate her to space permanently, the
blonde realized there was no turning back.

//My last chance, and I took it, and I won.//

The blonde&#39;s heart threatened to burst with relief, smiling as another
crack of lightning snaked its way through the clouds high above.

The storm had almost been too much to ask for, a way to get Relena into
the car without too much argument on the other girl&#39;s part.  Dorothy had
been right, in assuming that Relena had barely eaten or slept, that her
habits hadn&#39;t improved since the assassination.

//They still treated you like you were goddamned /disposable/.//

The sedative in the tea had taken hold almost immediately, and Dorothy had
almost not been able to get the brunette to the car before she fell
asleep.

//My angel.//

Dorothy looked over, at the girl who was curled up on the other side of
the car, legs tucked up, hands crossed limply at her waist.  Relena looked
so young, so vulnerable, not at all like the leader of the most powerful
nation on earth.

 //Well Zechs, I hope you have a backup plan for losing your figurehead. 
From now on, Relena Peacecraft is mine.//

Resisting the urge to cackle in delight, Dorothy, Relena and The Car sped
off into the night.

----------------------

&quot;What do you /mean/ you don&#39;t know where she is?&quot;

Noin hadn&#39;t ever heard Zechs sound so angry, speaking through teeth
clenched so tightly she thought she could hear them crack.  The duke was
trembling with barely leashed fury, staring at the head of the guard with
blue eyes that had gone well past supernova.

&quot;I... sir, when I came back from the gate, most of the guards from that
shift were gone, they had switched posts.  We didn&#39;t even realize anything
was wrong until you returned.  No one saw Miss Peacecraft leave here.  I
don&#39;t know what happened.&quot;

Quatre and Trowa ran into the room, and all eyes turned to meet them.

&quot;Dorothy isn&#39;t... in her room, either.&quot; Quatre gasped, out of breath from
the run.

&quot;Her car is gone.&quot; Trowa added.

&quot;I&#39;ll kill her.&quot;  

Zechs growled as Noin paled, and her eyes became equally as sharp and
angry as his.  

&quot;Dorothy Catalonia is a dead woman.&quot;
