<pre>I tell my lies 

And I despise 

Every second I&#146;m with you

- &#147;Trash&#148;, Korn

* * * * *

There&#146;s something intoxicating about her, something I can&#146;t quite 
explain. I knew the moment I saw her that she would be the death of 
me. I was an addict before I&#146;d even taken my first hit.

And it was odd, really, how attached I felt, because I honestly had no 
reason to feel so. I was her enemy; I despised her and her ideals; I 
mocked her. And all the while she merely stood, smiling at me. A 
perfect smile. A fake smile. A doll&#146;s smile.

I wanted to rip it off her pretty little face. I wanted her to know 
true pain. I wanted to make her cry, beg, bleed. I wanted her to see 
just how foolish she really was.

And yet, I&#146;d never felt closer to anyone in my life. I genuinely 
enjoyed listening to her talk of peace and pacifism and her other 
foolish notions. I loved the way my name rolled out of her mouth, 
fully of false pleasantness and true exasperation. I felt an 
overwhelming sense of control when I was in her presence, because it 
was, after all, me who was in control.

I wonder sometimes if she even knew it.

She was starved for friendship when I came along, and I offered it to 
her. And I like to think that at least some of the time, I was a good 
little friend. I listened to her woes and gave her false sympathy and 
praised her when I saw it fit. Maybe we really became some demented 
version of friends, maybe we never did. I personally don&#146;t think that 
we did, but it hardly matters.

Either way, she still would have crawled into my bed in the middle of 
the night like she did. She still would have leaned into me, silently 
begged for me to be the first to take her. She still would have moaned 
when I did and arched her back when she came. And she still would have 
held on to me afterwards and kissed me until I felt lightheaded.

Friendship didn&#146;t push her into that bed that night, just as it didn&#146;t 
the next night and then the night after.

She came for the same reason that I let her, because we were supposed 
to hate each other. And there was something so utterly delicious about 
fucking your &#145;enemy&#146;.

* * * * *

She glances up at me and I watch her eyes flicker before she returns 
them to her papers, a sign that she wants me to go so that she can 
finish her paperwork. I&#146;ve never met anyone else who enjoys doing 
paperwork after sex.

Her deformity simply delights me. I refuse to leave her alone.

&#147;Miss Relena,&#148; I murmur, shivering as a rush of power gushes through 
me, &#147;may I inquire as to what you&#146;re working on?&#148; 

She gives me an irritated glance. &#147;I have a meeting tomorrow,&#148; she 
tells me in her perfect princess voice, as if it should explain 
everything.

&#147;Hm. You work so hard, Miss Relena.&#148; I fill my voice with false 
enthusiasm, and I know that she can hear the underlying disgust. I so 
despise her work and the amount of time that she spends working.

&#147;Is there something that you want, Dorothy?&#148;

I can&#146;t hold back a delighted smirk at her annoyance as our gazes 
meet; I can feel the heat of it and I wonder idly if she can too. &#147;No, 
not really,&#148; I say, moving slowly closer to her until I&#146;m sitting on 
the bed with her, nearly lying on her. I expect her to push me away 
from her, as she&#146;s done countless times before. I so love when she 
does that, because she looks so intense when she does so.

She surprises me this time.

Her lips cover mine hungrily, her tongue slipping inside my mouth. She 
tastes like cherries, innocence. Her arms grasp a hold of mine, 
pushing me into her, the paperwork long forgotten by her side. I pull 
away, feeling dizzy and alive.

&#147;I hate you,&#148; she tells me quietly, moving to nibble my neck. Such a 
tender gesture joined with such hateful words. It&#146;s beautiful.

I step off the bed, leaving her gazing up at me, breathing heavily and 
face flushed. I study her for a moment as I do quite often. She looks 
her age now, not at all like her normal self, which resembles a 
thirty-year-old single mother. I pointed it out to her once, how her 
wonderful pacifist life made her appear so tired, so unhappy. She 
laughed at me, that bland nasal sound, and told me she was happy 
enough. We never spoke of it again.

&#147;The war is over, you know,&#148; I say, not allowing my gaze to falter. It 
seems irrelevant and I&#146;m unaware of exactly where the thought came 
from.

She stares at me evenly. &#147;It&#146;s been over for several months.&#148;

&#147;I know,&#148; I tell her. &#147;But we&#146;ve never discussed it, and I want to 
hear your thoughts on it.&#148; Then as an afterthought, &#147;Miss Relena.&#148;

Whatever unusual mood spread over the room only minutes before was 
broken, and I could feel with relief her annoyance returning.

&#147;You may go now, Dorothy.&#148; Just as though I&#146;m her servant. She returns 
her attention to her papers, and with a smile I turn to leave.

She still believes that she&#146;s in control.

It&#146;s tragic, really, how something so beautiful can be so exceedingly 
na&iuml;ve.

* * * * *

I remember a conversation I had with Milliardo once, about her. I 
forget when or where it was, but I remember the rest vividly.

&#147;You love her, don&#146;t you?&#148; he had asked me, his eyes glittering, not 
at all unlike hers.

&#147;What?&#148; I had been caught off guard, and it was a peculiar question.

&#147;Relena,&#148; he clarified softly, turning away. &#147;You&#146;re in love with 
her.&#148;

I considered lying to him, because it would be so easy. He was her 
brother; lying seemed to be the only option. But I didn&#146;t. Instead I 
stayed silent and thought the situation through.

Was I in love with her?

Maybe I had been, once upon a time, for a brief period before we began 
to share a bed. I really didn&#146;t remember that far back. But was I 
then, at that moment? I answered him completely and honestly.

&#147;No,&#148; I said. &#147;I want to corrupt her.&#148;
