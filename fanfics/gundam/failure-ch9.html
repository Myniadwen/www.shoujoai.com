<h1>Failure of Vision (part 9 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rzrblade.html">Rzrblade33</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gundam/failure-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>&#147;You&#146;re in love with her.&#148;

Familiar words, familiar conversation. I wonder if they&#146;ll ever stop 
assuming that sex equals love, when it obviously doesn&#146;t.

&#147;No, I want to corrupt her.&#148; I give him the same response that I gave 
Milliardo years before. It&#146;s just as true now as it was then. Isn&#146;t 
it?

&#147;You already have.&#148;

This startles me and I whip my head around to glare at him in shock. 
&#147;Excuse me?&#148; I think for a moment that I imagined his words, that he 
never spoke. But Duo continues to smile at me, almost mockingly, and I 
realize that he did speak.

&#147;You&#146;ve already corrupted her. She is as corrupt as she is going to 
get. You&#146;ve taken nearly everything that she has to offer and a few 
things that she doesn&#146;t. So you must still be with her for a reason. 
You must want something else. Her heart, maybe?&#148; He cocks his head, 
and his eyes twinkle with the reflection of the chandelier. &#147;Although 
I think you already have that as well.&#148;

I decide that I despise his smile even more than I do Relena&#146;s. He has 
a jester&#146;s smile, and it doesn&#146;t look at all fake. It looks real and 
truthful, like he truly is just a happy-go-lucky boy with no worries. 
But I know better than that. I know that he isn&#146;t a natural comedian; 
that fun and jokes don&#146;t come easily. It&#146;s all a mask. He&#146;s hiding 
things behind that smile. I positively hate not being able to see what 
it is.

&#147;I don&#146;t know what you&#146;re talking about,&#148; I tell him, trying to look 
nonchalant. But inside my head is spinning at what he&#146;s implying.

&#147;Of course you don&#146;t,&#148; he says, his voice resembling one of a man 
speaking to a small child. I feel more than insulted but bite my 
tongue anyways.

&#147;When are you leaving?&#148; I ask instead, figuring it to be a safe 
question, although I know the answer already.

&#147;Tomorrow.&#148;

&#147;And Heero is going with you?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148; His voice is soft, distant. I wonder what he&#146;s thinking, if he 
sounds so wistful every time he thinks of Heero. And then I wonder 
what it feels like to be in love and why two people - two ex-Gundam 
pilots - allow themselves to fall to such an emotion. &#147;You know, 
Dorothy, I think that you and I are more alike than you probably 
realize,&#148; he murmurs, letting himself look away from me.

&#147;We are?&#148; I ask, not allowing my disbelief to show. I can&#146;t possibly 
imagine what the two of us could have in common, me and this braided 
American fool. I repress the urge to scoff at him.

&#147;Yes.&#148; He doesn&#146;t elaborate, and I&#146;m sure that I don&#146;t want him to. I 
don&#146;t want to hear why he thinks we are alike; I don&#146;t want to hear 
what he has to say.

We are silent for the next few minutes, which really seem like hours. 
I can&#146;t remember a time when I was so ill at ease. I consider leaving 
the room if he has nothing more to articulate. I have much more 
substantial things to do than sit and stare impatiently at Duo 
Maxwell.

He speaks again just as I stand, his voice devoid of any emotion. 
&#147;You&#146;re fooling yourself. You know that, don&#146;t you?&#148;

&#147;What do you mean?&#148;

&#147;I thought for a while that you knew what you were doing, that you had 
this big plan in mind, because it seems like something that you&#146;d do. 
Because sometimes you&#146;re like that. But now I see that you&#146;ve blinded 
yourself. You can&#146;t see what&#146;s staring you straight in the face.&#148; He&#146;s 
getting agitated, and I&#146;m confused. He&#146;s speaking as though this is 
the most important affair in the world, but to me all it is is a 
jumble of irrational thoughts.

&#147;I thought it was entertaining at first,&#148; he continues, still seething 
over something that I don&#146;t understand. &#147;But now it&#146;s just so damn 
annoying. This&#133;this whole situation is one big failure of vision on 
your part.&#148;

He storms out of the room, and I hear his footsteps echoing through 
the house. I listen to them until they disappear and I&#146;m left standing 
alone in one of the many dining rooms, listening to the ticking of an 
old grandfather clock.

And I begin to wonder if maybe my whole life hasn&#146;t been one big 
failure of vision.
