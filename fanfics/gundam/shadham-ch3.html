<a href="../gundam/shadham-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Releena looked around the upper story apartment with no little awe. The
living room alone was massive, and from what she could see the other
rooms were almost as large. She ran over to the window and looked out
at a spectacular view of the city below. She turned to look at a smiling
Hilde. &quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting this!&quot;

Hilde laughed. &quot;You should be safe here. There are no buildings anywhere
around this building near this height, so no one can shoot in easily. 
I&#39;ve registered us here under a well established alias with a verifiable
history. Also, I&#39;ve used this place enough times, tipping generously,
that the staff doesn&#39;t ask any questions.&quot; she explained.

&quot;How did you find it?&quot; Releena asked curiously.

&quot;Remember back when Noin was running missions for you and the Sank
Kingdom? She established this as a safe house then.&quot; she smiled. &quot;I&#39;ve
always liked to have a fall back position, as well.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Releena said, frowning. &quot;Why here?&quot;

&quot;In a standard Taurus mobile suit, Noin could have you evacuated out of
the Sank and over here in an hour&quot; Hilde explained calmly, &quot;just in
case. When she found out I was going to be your bodyguard, she told me
about it soon thereafter.&quot;

Releena looked at her in a bit of surprise. &quot;All of you have made sure
you could save me,&quot; she said softly, looking at Hilde fondly.

&quot;Just doing my job,&quot; Hilde said with a shy smile.

&quot;Above and beyond the call of duty,&quot; Releena said smiling. &quot;Have I ever
thanked any of you for how well you&#39;ve protected me over the years?&quot;

&quot;Not so well, and I had help,&quot; Hilde said dryly. &quot;The Gundams,
Preventers, your brother, Heero...I&#39;m sorry. I-&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right, Hilde,&quot; Releena calmly assured her. &quot;I&#39;ve accepted the
fact that he&#146;s gone and never coming back some time ago,&quot; her voice
catching as she stated this. &quot;So I think I can bear mention of his
name.&quot; She smiled across to her sadly. 

Releena continued, &quot;Anyway, I just wanted to thank you, for all you&#39;ve
done for me over the years. In your line of work, I doubt you hear that
often.&quot;

Hilde was actually blushing brightly; something Releena found herself
secretly enjoying. &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Hilde quietly replied.  

As they unpacked their suitcases quickly, Releena asked Hilde, suddenly
curious, &quot;Did Noin tell you about the times when the I had traveled with
her?&quot;

Hilde chuckled softly. &quot;Oh, yes. She says you snore, by the way,&quot; she
said to her teasingly.

&quot;I do not!&quot; Releena protested, and Hilde laughed. A loud gurgle was
heard, and Hilde looked at Releena in surprise. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Releena said
with a little blush.

Hilde grinned and shook her head. &quot;Dress up nice, we&#39;re going to
dinner,&quot; she laughed. Hilde then pulled out a bagged dress from one of
her bags, and went into the bathroom to change, as Releena began to dig
through her own luggage.

Later, they sat together at the restaurant, a three-course meal lay out
around them, and soft candlelight illuminated their features. &#39;Hilde
sure cleans up good,&#39; Releena thought, as she looked across at her
dinner companion. Hilde was in a classically styled black dress, simple
and elegant, with a little makeup and her pierced ears as the only
accents.

&quot;I noticed no one here seems to be bothered by two ladies eating dinner
together,&quot; Releena remarked curiously.

Hilde nodded thoughtfully. &quot;We&#39;re not too far from the city&#39;s gay
district, so it&#39;s not too unusual,&quot; she said. Hilde looked at Releena
in her pink dress, an off the shoulder number that was classy and sexy
looking, and didn&#39;t even try to mention the &#39;business meeting&#39; excuse.
Of course most people would assume they were on a date, but as long as
it didn&#39;t bother Releena...

&quot;Well, if I am out on a date, then at least I&#39;m with the best looking
woman here,&quot; Releena said with a wicked smile on her face. Hilde looked
at her, dumbfounded, then began to laugh. Releena joined her, her soft
laughter a nice counterpoint to Hilde&#146;s.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hilde said with a grin.

They ate together quietly. When they had finished, Hilde looked over at
Releena. &quot;You know, I&#39;ve wanted to do this for a long time,&quot; Hilde said,
standing and offering Releena her hand. Releena took it hesitantly, and
Hilde firmly pulled her to her feet. She led Releena over to the dance
floor, and gently led her to the dance music. They swayed gently
together, the soft lighting making everything seem like a scene from a
movie.

&quot;You lead very well,&quot; Releena said with a smile.

&quot;Thank you, very much,&quot; Hilde said, holding Releena closely in her arms.
&quot;But I couldn&#39;t lead so well if you weren&#39;t so very good at following.&quot;
She spun Releena out, drew her in close, and with a stylish move dipped
her. The music ended, and the nearby patrons applauded cheerfully.
Releena and Hilde each took their bows, and they returned to their
table. &quot;I hope I didn&#39;t embarrass you out there,&quot; Hilde said softly.

Releena laughed, smiling up at a slightly surprised Hilde, &quot;It was the
most fun I&#39;ve had in ages.&quot; They finished off their deserts peacefully,
and finished the night talking softly. 

Later that evening, Hilde gently opened the door and looked in on the
fast-asleep Releena. The girl slept there soundly, the strain that
sometimes showed on her face erased by the sweet balm of sleep. &#39;She
looks so innocent and carefree,&#39; Hilde thought. She smiled at her, and
gently closed the door. She walked over to the couch, and prepared to
lay down there herself.

She remembered Noin telling her via e-mail, the only way the two ex-
soldiers kept in touch since she went to Mars with Zechs, about the time
she had met Releena for the very first time: she had been struggling
like a wild cat in the group of OZ soldiers&#39; arms. She just absolutely
refused to give in, to let them take her anywhere. It had been because
she had tried to kill Lady Une to avenge her Father&#146;s death at Une&#146;s
hands, and she had very nearly pulled it off. Hilde had known then that
this was a girl that was not to be crossed, ever. She laughed to herself
softly, and curled up on the couch. &#39;She&#39;s really quite the lady,&#39;
Hilde thought drowsily.

Releena heard the door open a little, then close, and smiled sleepily.
&#39;Hilde, checking I&#39;m all right,&#39; she thought, as she drifted off to
sleep.</pre>
