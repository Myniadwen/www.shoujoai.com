<h1>Equals</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cutter.html">Cutter</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Some days I wonder what I did to deserve her. 

She is everything I dreamed, that day when I finally got fed up with 
wanting and just took. I suspected that day that we could compliment 
each other, challenge each other. That we&#39;d be good partners. But I 
never imagined this. 

She really *is* my partner. The thing is, when you expect a thing to be 
wonderful in its difficulty, you don&#39;t really believe it&#39;s going to be; 
you don&#39;t really think about what it&#39;s going to *feel* like when you 
have your first argument about who is too protective and who gets to be 
in charge of what and who gets to do what in bed. It&#39;s hard. You knew it 
would be hard, you were looking forward to it, you were *banking* on it, 
and yet when it happens, it&#39;s somehow a complete shock.

The worst is that Noin always wants to pilot the plane.

Honestly, though, I would take this one infuriating woman over any 
doting lover the world could offer me. I love her strength; I think some 
part of me needs the challenge of it, like I need air. Even though she 
can be so annoying at times... at least I have to respect her. I have 
never respected a lover before. They all let me rule them.

But once I helped her figure out that passive, &quot;Zechs, it&#39;s been X years 
and Y days&quot;-style infatuation wasn&#39;t truly her, she wouldn&#39;t go back to 
being a doormat, even for me, even when I thought I wanted her to. She 
just juts out that adorable obstinate chin and gives me the &quot;Sally, 
*NO*&quot; look. Or the &quot;Sally, it&#39;s *MY* turn&quot; look.

Or the goddamned &quot;Sally, *I*&#39;m flying the plane&quot; look....

Heh. Anyway. I love her. I do. She knows what I need, like no one else 
has ever understood it. From a friend, from an ally, from a lover. Some 
few people have managed the first or the second one, but even they 
haven&#39;t ever really gotten the third. Noin does.

It&#39;s so funny... all my other lovers, and they have all been women, have 
told me the sex was great. They all enjoyed it. But none of them ever 
really *got* it. How much I need to be inside. Oh, any woman loves a 
girlfriend who&#39;s even crazier about fucking than she is about being 
fucked, sure. It&#39;s to her advantage, so why question it?

Noin questions it. And she understands it, how I sometimes look at her 
and I need to, I need so badly to be on top of her, to kiss her neck, 
and most of all to have my fingers deep, deep inside her. I&#39;ve always 
been that way, but it&#39;s even more with her, because I love her. It&#39;s so 
hard to control sometimes... having her pinned safely beneath my body, 
it makes me feel secure. It&#39;s the only way to keep the world from 
tilting and spinning crazily, sometimes. I feel my heart beating 
erratically in my chest, and I&#39;m weak and hollow, and I need to know 
she&#39;s beneath me, and she can&#39;t leave me. And I need to be inside. 
Inside, stroking, watching her face and making her scream and then 
making her come, and knowing that she&#39;s panting for me, that it&#39;s me and 
no one else that did it, that she&#39;s at my mercy. I need that.

Sometimes she gives it to me, and sometimes she doesn&#39;t. Those times, 
she makes me wait, or does me first, before she&#39;ll let me do anything. 
Or she&#39;ll just put her arms around me and hold me for a long time, lying 
together on the bed with all our clothes on, me rocking slightly against 
her leg and whimpering. It&#39;s torture. And she looks into my eyes, and 
sees me, and knows. But she won&#39;t be my fuck toy just because it&#39;s fun, 
or let my control games get out of hand. She knows that would wreck us. 
So sometimes, she says no, and lets me need.

Just like I used to slap her, so that she could slap back. So it 
wouldn&#39;t wreck us.

Because it&#39;s so rare in this world to find someone who&#39;s different from 
you and yet your equal in every way; equal in fighting, in leading, in 
flying, in love. Our subordinates are terrified of us. I am the luckiest 
woman alive, and only we two know it, because we are perfectly matched. 
So I&#39;m glad it&#39;s hard; it&#39;s worth the difficulty for the challenge she 
presents.

I just wish once, just once, she would let me fly the damn plane.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don&#39;t know about you guys, but Tekka and I were extremely proud of 
Noin in this fic. Even if she doesn&#39;t give Sally her fair share of 
flight time....

Noin: Oi! I&#39;m the fighter pilot! It&#39;s only fair! 
Sally: I *can* fly a plane too, you know. ::grinds teeth:: Sweetie.
Noin: Yeah, Sal, but this is what I was born to do. This is my 
profession, you know? You&#39;re a doctor. Do I ever try to take over the 
med kit when you want to examine somebody? 
Sally: But-- ::sighs:: Never mind. I give up. I just give up.
Noin: ::beams:: Love you, koi!
