<h1>Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Revolution (part 20 of 26)</h1>

<a href="../gundam/revolution-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back, Releena,&quot; Arisugawa Juri said
softly as they walked the halls of the colony, the
taller orange haired woman positioned protectively by
her side while she escorted her to her temporary
quarters.

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Releena Peacecraft agreed, having exchanged
her formal suit for a simple jumpsuit. The brown
haired woman looked faintly amused as she murmured,
&quot;You don&#39;t have to be so protective, you know.&quot;

Juri backed off a bit, looking sheepish. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she
smiled, &quot;I just keep remembering the times OZ tried to
kill you.&quot;

Releena reached out, gently taking Juri&#39;s hand. &quot;At
least here I&#39;m probably safe,&quot; she said softly, &quot;at
least from OZ.&quot;

&quot;That sounds ominous,&quot; Juri noted.

&quot;Not quite that bad,&quot; Releena made a face, &quot;the
politics of the situation are just so fluid right
now.... My brother Zechs has christened himself
Miliardo, Treise is in exile and some say a new power
is running things behind the scenes at OZ.&quot;

&quot;Dorothy Catalonia?&quot; Juri guessed.

&quot;No, she&#39;s a servant too, I think,&quot; Releena frowned.
She gestured, &quot;What&#39;s bothering me is that no one I
contact seems to be able to get a bead on who&#39;s really
running things on Earth right now. It&#39;s almost as if
their being led by a ghost.&quot;

&quot;Maybe your father can help shed some light on it,&quot;
Juri mused. A figure was making his way up the hall
and she softly muttered, &quot;Uh oh.&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Releena looked away from Juri to see who was
coming and almost instantly understood Juri&#39;s
reaction.

Wu Fei Cheng strode towards them with a scowl on his
handsome Asian face, quite deliberately not giving way
for them. When Juri moved to let him pass he gave her
a look of disdain as he coldly muttered, &quot;Arisugawa.&quot;

&quot;We Fei,&quot; Juri nodded politely, &quot;lovely day, isn&#39;t
it?&quot; All she got in answer was a grunt, the young man
walking away, back stiff and shoulders straight.

&quot;That was polite,&quot; Releena blinked as he moved off.
She gave Juri a curious look, &quot;What was that all
about?&quot;

&quot;He doesn&#39;t approve of a Earth born pilot in command
of the Wing Gundam,&quot; Juri said calmly as they started
off down the hall, &quot;and just between you and me the
rumors say he&#39;s also sympathetic to the White Fang.&quot;

Releena made a face at the name of the colony
terrorists organization, the same group that had once
taken a shot at killing Lady Une and nearly gotten her
and Juri. &quot;Didn&#39;t the colonies officially repudiate
the Fang?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Officially yes, but there&#39;s still a large faction
within the colonies that approves of taking that kind
of direct action,&quot; Juri shrugged. &quot;Especially with all
the dirty tactics OZ used in the colonies over the
years,&quot; she added with a grim smile.

&quot;True enough,&quot; Releena acknowledged, having been the
target of some of those dirty tactics herself over the
past few months. They reached the room designated for
Releena&#39;s use and hesitated there before Releena
smiled shyly, &quot;Would you like to come in?&quot;

Juri hesitated, &quot;Releena, I....&quot;

Releena put a hand on the arm of Juri&#39;s simple gray
uniform, her eyes gentle. &quot;I thought we got over this
months ago,&quot; she said softly.

Juri blushed faintly and cleared her throat. &quot;Maybe we
should talk about it inside?&quot; she conceded with a
smile.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Releena used her pass key and opened up
the room, revealing a simple two room suite. Even with
just a bedroom and small living room it was still
bigger than most colony residents had, befitting her
status as a diplomat. She waved Juri to one of the
seats as she asked, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

Juri stayed on her feet, looking down at Releena
tenderly. &quot;You&#39;re a diplomat for the space colonies,
one of the two heirs to the Peacecraft monarchy and
also the daughter of Earth&#39;s leading representative,&quot;
she said to her softly. Juri sighed softly as she
confessed, &quot;I don&#39;t want to complicate your life any
farther, Releena.&quot;

Releena gave her a look of fond exasperation, &quot;Didn&#39;t
we just talk about your over protectiveness?&quot; She
stepped up beside Juri and looked into her eyes as she
added huskily, &quot;Maybe I want that complication, Juri.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt you,&quot; Juri confessed hesitantly,
&quot;most of the people I&#39;ve fallen for have come to bad
ends.&quot;

Releena quickly closed the gap to rest her head on
Juri&#39;s shoulder, gently sliding her arms up and around
the taller girl. &quot;I&#39;m not Shiori,&quot; she murmured to her
softly, &quot;or Utena, Juri. I can take care of myself.&quot;

&quot;I....&quot; Juri fought the urge a moment, then brought
her arms up around Releena, savoring how she felt
against her body.

Releena looked up at her compassionately, her brown
eyes shining slightly then she closed then, tilting
her face up for a kiss. They came together, lips
touching once gently, then again more hungrily. Juri&#39;s
hands slid down possessively over Releena&#39;s form even
as the smaller girl tangled her fingers in Juri&#39;s
hair, prolonging the kiss.


*Bing bong* the door chime rang out.


&quot;Fuck,&quot; Releena pulled back with a choked groan.

&quot;Whoever that is I&#39;m going to kill them,&quot; Juri
muttered as the door chime rang again, both taking a
step apart and tidying their clothes.

Releena sighed as she fixed her hair, &quot;Better wait and
see who it is first.&quot; She strode over to the door and
pulled it open barking, &quot;What?!&quot;

The blonde haired man blinked in surprise, his eyes
widening a little. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Quatre Winner said
mildly.

Releena looked at his innocent expression and sighed.
&quot;Never mind,&quot; she said in gentler tones, &quot;how can I
help you?&quot;

A bit apologetically Quatre said, &quot;I was actually
looking for Juri, Wu Fei mentioned she was with you?&quot;

Juri smiled wryly at Quatre&#39;s sense of discretion,
tactfully giving her a chance to compose herself after
the kiss. &quot;How can I help?&quot; she asked him, her manner
and appearance hopefully as cool and composed as
usual.

&quot;I just finished running this by Commander Hilde,&quot;
Quatre pushed his hair back, &quot;We&#39;ve finally got a lead
on what happened to some of the Gundam scientists.&quot;

&quot;Why do I get the feeling this is not good news?&quot; Juri
asked with a sigh.

&quot;Treise has them,&quot; Quatre said flatly.

Juri began to curse even as Releena looked back and
forth in confusion. &quot;Okay, what&#39;s going on?&quot; Releena
had to ask.

&quot;It&#39;s not something we&#39;ve released widely,&quot; Juri
revealed, &quot;but several of the scientists who created
the Gundams disappeared when we lost a colony to the
Earth forces. We thought they&#39;d been killed but
apparently not.&quot;

&quot;How bad is it?&quot; Releena asked.

Quatre sighed softly. &quot;To be honest we&#39;re not too
sure,&quot; he admitted, &quot;our contact didn&#39;t have much more
information than that.&quot;

Juri paced a moment, a frown on her face, &quot;We&#39;d better
assume the worst, that they&#39;re developing Mobile Suits
for OZ and the Earth forces.&quot;

&quot;They wouldn&#39;t,&quot; Quatre started.

&quot;OZ could have some leverage on them,&quot; Releena cut him
off gently, &quot;and I hate to say it but if your life is
on the line, you can do things you might never
consider before.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Quatre shrugged. He looked over at Juri and
said, &quot;I came to get you because a group of pilots and
tactical officers are getting together to try and
prepare contingency plans. Would you mind joining us?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Juri nodded. Quietly she added to
Releena, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;You have to do you duty,&quot; Releena agreed gently. A
faint smile, &quot;Could you stop here after you&#39;re done?
I&#39;d like us to continue what we were doing earlier.&quot;

Juri blushed faintly, &quot;Right.&quot;</pre>
