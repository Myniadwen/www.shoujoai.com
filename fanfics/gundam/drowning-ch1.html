<pre>Hilde sighed. The apartment looked like it was ran over by a tornado. 
Duo always left the cleaning duty to her and it was damn right unfair! 
Well, at least she didn&#39;t do Duo&#39;s laundry. Bad enough that people 
thought they were a couple with the fact that they lived under the 
same roof. She snorted. Yeah, that&#39;d be cool. Me and Duo. Oh yeah, 
baby! When pigs fly! 

Besides, she never wished in her whole life for Heero Yuy to break her 
bones with his bare hands. 

She and Duo had combined their comical forces to find a way start 
their lives after the war. Hilde asked her braided friend about Heero. 
It was obvious enough that Duo loved the other pilot so much no matter 
how hard Duo tried to avoid the topic. But Duo&#39;s answer was a sincere, 
concerned smile that said, &quot;&#133;He&#39;ll find me when he&#39;s ready&#133;&quot; 

They rented a rather spacious apartment for a single person. It was 
convenient for the both of them and it was a big help for the budget. 
They started a small business&#133; an electronics repair shop. She tried 
to decide against it a first but when Duo said that it was a great 
idea, she then decided to go for it. She trusted her best friend&#39;s 
beliefs and vibes. 

Hilde jumped as the apartment&#39;s door banged. 

&quot;Ooooooiiiiiiii!!!!! Tadaimaaaa!!!&quot; Duo hollered in the hallway. Hilde 
jumped for the second time as she turned around and saw Duo&#39;s head pop 
into view. 

&quot;Okaeri nasai.&quot; Hilde sweatdropped. 

&quot;What&#39;s with the long face? It&#39;s a Friday night!!! You should wear a 
beautiful smile and relax!&quot; 

&quot;How am I supposed to relax with all of your mangas are scattered on 
the floor?! I can&#39;t even sit on the couch because I have to pick up 
all of those tapes you own! Duo! You could&#39;ve at least unclogged the 
stuff also known as your hair in the bathroom sink!&quot; 

Duo pushed some of the tapes to a far side of the couch so that he 
could make just enough space for him and Hilde to sit. He grabbed her 
weary friend by her shoulders and led her to sit on the couch. &quot;Easy, 
easy!!! Don&#39;t be too hot!!! Like I said, it&#39;s a Friday night! We must 
loosen you up!&quot; 

Hilde looked at the mess around her. &quot;How?&quot; She meeped. 

&quot;We&#39;ll go clubbing! Woohoo, &#145;Lezboz&#146;!!! It&#39;s dyke night!&quot; Duo hollered 
as she dragged her weary friend out of the apartment. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Bright neon lights colorized the dark alleys that night. The young 
sophomore student was dressed in comfortable red leather pants that 
clung to her tight bottom. She was wearing a silky blue loose shirt, 
which matched her blue eyes and massive bangs. Her girlfriend took her 
for another night out without her parents knowing. To a night club 
where most of their classmates go to meet cute older women. Hilde had 
gone addicted to these kinds of places. She laughed and steadied her 
cap but the accessory went flying away with the breeze. 

Worried eyes followed the cap and Hilde&#146;s feet picked up speed as she 
tried to catch up with her flying cap. She jumped for it but went 
crashing into someone&#146;s face. 

&#147;Go-g-g-gomen nasai!&#148; Hilde apologized to the person she bumped into. 
The person was on her feet after a second and was extending a hand to 
her. She blinked but took the hand and hauled herself up to regain 
footing. Then, she almost stumbled as she looked into the other 
person&#146;s eyes. 

The other girl&#146;s gorgeous misty purple eyes&#133; 

Hilde was then distracted as the girl in front of her handed her the 
cap. Hilde eyed her cap dumbly then stared at the girl once again. It 
seemed she couldn&#146;t let go of the stare. 

The lady smiled. Then turned around and walked away. The raven-haired 
was about to ask for her name&#133; was about to say thank you&#133; when her 
girlfriend took her arm and led her away. 

&#147;Ne, Hilde? Let&#146;s go?&#148; Marina&#133; her girlfriend was one sweet darling 
Hilde could not resist. This girl wormed her way into her heart just 
as she was trying to get away&#133;. 

Get away&#133; run away&#133; from what? From the truth&#133; the truth which proved 
that she was not like any ordinary female when it comes to being 
attracted to another human being. The realization hit her at a very 
young age. Hilde knew she was different but never bothered to confront 
the situation at hand. She knew this was trouble. Parents are one and 
society is the second. She never knew the school crowd would be a 
problem. 

Hilde had a crush one day. It was her classmate named Marina. She 
became her classmate when she came to this all-girls school for 
freshman high. It shocked her when almost two thirds of the population 
had a crush on her. Hilde looked very handsome for a girl. She was 
lean and muscled because of her early years when she always played 
rough games and basketball. Many admirers came to her every morning to 
pick her bag up for her and carry it all the way to her classroom. And 
at the end of the day, many of them would send her some love notes and 
stuff as love tokens. Amongst all the pretty girls in St. Cutter&#146;s 
High, her classmate Marina had caught her eye. 

Hilde tried to hide her feelings and her shyness made their talks 
seldom. She only got to chat with the other girl when they were group 
members for a project and when they had classroom meetings. Hilde had 
long given up on confessing her feelings because she was much too 
intimidated by a senior student who was forcing herself on Marina. She 
accepted the fact that they looked good together. 

Unbeknownst to the heavy banged girl, Marina admired her as well. Both 
girls were secretly in love with each other. 

Rumors spread easily when you are in an exclusive school. Both girls 
were victims of this kind of plague. It seemed Hilde was the last 
person to know. When she was running down the hall that day to find 
where her princess was,&#133; all hell broke loose&#133; 

It was a noon of outrage. Classmates were screaming, friends were 
shouting, senior students were hollering but Hilde&#146;s fangirls were the 
noisiest. They were crying and shrieking&#133; begging the senior student 
to stop butchering Hilde&#146;s body as if it was a punching bag. The 
senior student didn&#146;t take any defeats. And so, she made Hilde crumble 
to her knees&#133; to make sure she was more powerful than some school 
crush. 

But after that moment when Marina came to her aid with tears of sorrow 
and guilt in her eyes, Hilde was relieved that the girl was there. But 
thereafter, when Hilde knew the other girl&#146;s feelings, she vowed to 
love and protect the girl for all times. 

For all times&#133; 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

The Night Life&#133; something Hilde enjoyed in her early years. She also 
missed these kinds of night adventures of meeting eccentric people and 
stuff. Going home drunk and doing stupid things for fun. The lesbian 
bar called, &#145;Lezboz&#146; was owned by a group of three, whom Hilde had 
known from college. She didn&#146;t spend much time on visiting the place 
until Duo knew she knows who the owners were. Her braided best friend 
always took her to this place to cheer her up. But Hilde wasn&#146;t upset 
or anything&#133; it&#146;s just that&#133; she could feel something was bound to 
happen&#133; 

She shook her head. Must be the liquor&#133; Duo really enjoyed coming to 
this place with her. It was funny to think most people thought Duo&#146;s a 
girl and Hilde&#146;s GIRL to be exact. Hell, Duo could make a much 
prettier girl than Hilde. 

She and Duo were more than a little toasty, they were drinking tequila 
and shots of brandy all night. The club was playing techno music when 
Duo dragged her to the dance floor. Her friend was swaying his hips 
and dancing to the music, unstoppable. Hilde laughed out loud with her 
friend as she always did when they were together. She often wondered 
how Duo managed to be this happy-go-lucky. She envied him sometimes 
and yet contented to have this heaven sent friend to be with her. 

&#147;I wish Heero was here!&#148; Duo laughed maniacally and that sent Hilde 
slapping her knees as she was laughing at the thought. 

&#147;Remember that time we dragged him out of the house drunk? He was so 
damned noisy!&#148; 

&#147;He kept on asking why we were having clones and stuff like he wanted 
a Pocky company of his own! Saying that was his&#151;&#147; 

&#147;&#151;mission!!!&#148; Hilde and Duo chorused. 

&#147;And you know what was the funniest thing?&#148; 

Hilde laughed some more and supplied the answer, &#147;Holy shit! He was 
driving us crazy when he was taking his top off while doing a macho 
dance!&#148; 

Best friends laughed and slapping their foreheads to compel laughter 
but nothing worked. As the laughter subsided, Hilde noticed her 
friend&#146;s blush and was smiling to himself. 

&#147;You miss him, don&#146;t you?&#148; A nod was Hilde&#146;s answer. 

Hilde sighed. Her friend was playing &#145;hard to get&#146;. Not that she&#146;d say 
that to him out loud but she understood what he was feeling. She 
shrugged off the thought when she noticed her friend looking into 
another direction. When Duo turned to face her, she was shocked at the 
comical grin on his face. 

&#147;What?&#148; 

&#147;Prospect.&#148; Duo said as he pointed to a dark side of the club. A girl 
with aqua shoulder length hair was staring into her eyes as she looked 
at her. The girl smiled seductively and Hilde blushed, turning to look 
at his friend who has an amused look on his face. 

&#147;You want her?&#148; Hilde asked his friend in panic. &#147;Anou, Duo! I don&#146;t 
want to get into trouble! Heero&#146;ll kill me for not keeping an eye on 
you!&#148; 

&#147;What are YOU talking about?&#148; Duo laughed. &#147;The girl is looking at 
you, handsome!&#148; 

&#147;NANI?&#148; Hilde nervously stole a glance and saw the girl looking 
directly at her and biting her lower lip. Hilde eyes widened and could 
feel her hair standing on one end. She was about to melt when a tall 
blonde girl arrived and seemed to know the aqua-haired girl. Maybe 
because it was based on the fact Hilde saw them hold hands&#133; then they 
were kissing&#133; then the tall blonde&#146;s hands were roaming around while 
her head was buried at the crook of the other girl&#146;s neck. 

&#147;Hmm&#133; too bad&#133; that was a good one!&#148; Duo snapped his fingers and 
teased his friend some more. It had been always hard to get Hilde a 
date or someone. 

Hilde was fuming and very, very red. &#147;Shut up. I&#146;m not interested in 
getting myself into trouble, okay?!&#148; 

&#147;Aww, you&#146;re no fun! Let&#146;s stay for a little while then maybe we could 
get you somebody!&#148; 

Hilde frowned. She didn&#146;t even want to think about it. &#147;Ne, Duo, let&#146;s 
go home.&#148; 

&#147;But WHY?!&#148; 

Hilde scratched her head in frustration. &#147;I just wanna go home! C&#146;mon, 
please?&#148; 

&#147;Oh-kaaaaay&#133; but you&#146;re no fun, mind you!&#148; Duo chuckled. He followed 
his friend out of the club. &#147;Ne, Hilde-chan! You&#146;re walking a bit too 
fast! Wait for meeeee!!!&#148; 

Hilde grumbled on her way out. Some night out! First cutie she saw was 
taken! Damn. She walked briskly and took a look behind her, trying to 
get a sight of his braided friend&#133; 

&#133;when someone bumped into her. 

&#147;Ah, itai&#133;&#148; A mellow chirpy voice grunted. 

&#147;Anou&#133; go-g-go-gomen nasai, ojousan!&#148; Hilde gently hauled the girl 
upwards who landed on her bottom as soon as she bumped into her. The 
girl had chocolate brown hair and it was covering her face as her head 
was facing down. Panic crept into Hilde as she nervously looked at the 
fragile-looking girl&#133; then the girl lifted her head to face her. Hilde 
stared into her eyes&#133; 

&#133;the color of misty purple&#133; 

&#147;Oniisan, daijoubu?&#148; A lean, tall boy asked the woman in front of her 
and automatically recognized the boy was, shortly followed by a blonde 
boy. 

&#147;Cathrine-san, are you okay?&#148; 

Hilde blinked. Trowa and Quatre? 

&#147;Oi! Fancy meeting you here!&#148; Duo greeted the two fellow Gundam 
ex-pilots. 

&#147;Duo!&#148; Quatre shrieked and ran to hug his friend. Trowa let himself 
smile a little at the sight and focused his attention on Hilde. 

&#147;Trowa.&#148; 

Trowa nodded and smiled a little at the dark blue-haired woman. He 
attempted to steady his sister who batted his hands away. 

&#147;Daijoubu, Trowa.&#148; The brown-haired woman smiled at Hilde. Hilde was&#133; 
caught in a trance with that smile&#133; and the other girl seemed to stare 
back at her as well. 

&#147;AHEM,&#148; Duo coughed. &#147;Have you two met before? Then again, maybe not.&#148; 

Quatre giggled. &#147;Anou, Hilde, this is Trowa&#146;s sister, Cathrine Bloom. 
Cathrine-san, this is Hilde Schbeiker.&#148; 

&#147;Pleased to meet you, Hilde-san&#133;&#148; Cathrine extended her hand, her 
cheeks pinkening a bit. 

&#147;A-anou&#133; iie, the pleasure&#146;s all mine!&#148; Hilde accepting the hand, her 
eyes seemed stuck to those sparkling purple eyes. And her hand seemed 
to be stuck as well&#133; 

&#147;Why are you here by the way?&#148; Duo asked his fellow comrades. 

Trowa went to point at the circus tent that was near the club. Duo 
sweatdropped, &#147;Oh, I see.&#148; He then focused his attention on Quatre and 
snickered. &#147;And why are YOU here, Q?&#148; 

&#147;Ah, anou&#133;&#148; 

&#147;He dropped by to watch our new act.&#148; Trowa stated flatly. There was a 
faint flush on his cheeks. 

&#147;Yeah, right. Of course.&#148; Duo snickered some more. 

Cathrine and Hilde on the other hand were still staring at each other. 

&#145;She&#146;s so&#133; perfect&#133;&#146; Hilde mused to herself. There was no other word 
to describe the taller woman in front of her. She had wavy locks of 
chocolate brown hair that was so shiny that she would do anything to 
run her hands through those waves. Her captivating eyes were 
intoxicating&#133; she could feel herself drown in those depths. Thin 
kissable lips&#133; Every feature the girl is enough to send Hilde over the 
edge. There&#146;s something about the seemingly slightly older girl that 
held a hold on Hilde. 

Duo and Quatre was busy laughing and talking to each other until Duo 
had an odd look on his face as he saw Trowa&#146;s expression. Quatre&#146;s 
eyebrows met and took a look at his lover. Quatre was shocked. Never 
had he seen Trowa giggle soflty and a smirk was on his face. Both the 
braided and the blonde boys took a look at what the unibanged boy was 
amused with. 

The two women were still staring at each other in absolute awe.
