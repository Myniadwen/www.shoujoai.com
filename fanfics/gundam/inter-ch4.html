<h1>Intertwined (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a>

<a href="../gundam/inter-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>We arrived here about two hours ago. I still can&#39;t believe that I&#39;ve 
come. How much must one change to go from a five-star hotel to a 
sleeping bag on the ground in so short a time? Apparantly not much... 
only clothes. 

We brought a tent with us camping, but once we got here, and discussed 
the fact that it wasn&#39;t supposed to rain or snow, Noin and I made the 
decision to sleep under the stars. Of course, we&#39;re fools. It&#39;s 
December. Only the feeble-minded and the suicidal sleep outside in this 
weather. Heero, are you under this same sky? I giggle at the thought, 
and Noin looks over at me from her sleeping bag. 

I meet her eyes and smile. &quot;I was just thinking that we&#39;re crazy. And, 
just to let you know, my butt is freezing.&quot;

She giggles as well, and I smile. That sound isn&#39;t exactly a rare one, 
but I find it a treasure just the same. Noin slides out of her sleeping 
bag and motions for me to slide out of mine. Of course, I have no clue 
why, but I relent nonetheless. My lover is a pretty smart woman, so I 
like to let her take the lead. I can trust her not to take me anywhere 
that I don&#39;t want to go.

Noin pulls me into her arms for a moment, nuzzling at my neck. I wrinkle 
my nose, her nose is cold, but I wrap my arms around her anyway. She 
murmurs sweet nothings, and I begin to melt. She warms me: body, heart, 
and soul.

Then she pulls away and I turn to go back to my sleeping back, but she 
grabs my shoulder. &quot;No, silly. I was going to zip them together and make 
it a two-person sleeping bag. We&#39;d certainly stay warmer.&quot;

I smile and blush in realization, and help her in the task. Then, 
together, we climb into the flannel-lined, makeshift bed and turn our 
heads to the stars, just watching and waiting.

Her hand finds its way to mine, and we lay there in peace. The crickets 
are chirping, the water in the lake is lapping at the shores, and 
somewhere in the distance, an animal is calling to its mate. But, I have 
mine here. And, the air is seeping into the sleeping bag now.

She must have felt me shiver, for her hand squeezes mine a bit. I turn 
to her and kiss her cheek. She turns to me and kisses my lips. With her, 
I feel like I have a profound freedom that lets me forget about my 
cares, and just let my mind, hands, and lips meander about. And I decide 
that regardless of the cold, I&#39;m going to enjoy tonight.

I gasp. Her hand leaves mine and she turns and kisses me full-on. Her 
hands fall to my hips, and I realize that this is the moment. This is 
where our little kisses and gentle caresses move beyond that. We&#39;re 
bundled in sweats inside the joint sleeping bags, so she has little 
trouble tracing a finger beneath the elastic waistline of mine. She 
stops for a moment.

I blush as I speak. &quot;Why... Why did you stop?&quot;

She kisses my nose. &quot;To see if you were okay with it. I don&#39;t want to 
take you anywhere you don&#39;t want to go.&quot;

I smile and nod. &quot;Go wherever you please.&quot;

She kisses me again, and her fingers resume stroking my sensitive skin. 
I know I&#39;m moaning slightly under her caress, but I don&#39;t care. Let the 
crickets hear us. Her fingers ghost beneath the edge of my panties, and 
she presses her fingers lower searchingly.

I gasp as she comes in contact with my pleasure center. Oh, how good 
this feels. I have no basis of comparison, but I can&#39;t imagine anything 
being better than this... except for that. Her fingers are massaging me, 
occasionally sliding within me... I&#39;m about to explode with this... 
sensation.

My stomach muscles are tensing, my head is thrust back... Her mouth is 
on my neck now, gently suckling at my skin... Her fingers are... My mind 
is... I can&#39;t....

I come with a dignified scream, or so she says afterward. I&#39;m still 
waiting to catch my breath. But, she&#39;s here with me, and I&#39;m nuzzled up 
against her. She refuses to let me return the favor, claiming that 
there&#39;s time enough for it later. I can only hope that&#39;s true.

My love is beside me. Her hand rests easily on my hip, her lips easily 
on my shoulder, her easily within my heart.
