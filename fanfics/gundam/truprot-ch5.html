<h1>True Protector (part 5 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a>

<a href="../gundam/truprot-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re actually trying to steal a Peacemaker mobile 
suit,&quot; Releena said anxiously, as she stood concealed in the shadows 
by the partially open bay doors keeping watch for any soldiers on 
patrol. She was dressed in a all-black flight suit, her helmet rested 
at her feet and a small communication device was attached to her ear.

&quot;Welcome to a life of crime, my dear&quot; Noin answered her over the 
radio. &quot;I wish we could go through channels, of course, but the enemy 
must have someone very high up in the Preventers to keep successfully 
pulling off all their operations against us.&quot; There was the sound of a 
scrape of metal on metal, a yelp of pain, and then some muffled, but 
creative, curses. Finally, Releena heard a soft click! &quot;All right, 
lets go.&quot; Noin ordered.

Releena quickly walked into the hanger, but she slowed down a bit as 
she looked over the Peacemaker suit. It had an overall look similar in 
design to the original Wing Gundam, but instead of the &#39;nose cone&#39; 
shield that suit had carried, on this one a semi transparent 
crystalline matrix shield was used. A newly developed technology, once 
the shield was powered up, it was nearly indestructible. The beam 
saber looked like it was standard issue mobile suit tech, but it&#39;s 
appearance was deceptive. Instead of a cutting beam, it generated a 
disruptive effect in the electronics it passed through, there by 
disabling the enemy, not destroying them, like the many other weapons 
systems on the suit.

Releena took the lift up to the double cockpit, where Noin waited. She 
stood there in her own flight suit as she looked up at the suit 
herself. Releena slowed to take a moment to appreciate the overall 
niceness of the view of Noin&#39;s slim, sexy body in the body hugging 
uniform that matched hers.

Noin noticed what she was looking at and blushed a little, before she 
climbed into the lower navigation and flight control cockpit. She 
gestured Releena over to the weapons seat above her. &quot;Grab your seat, 
and let&#39;s go,&quot; Noin said crisply, as she checked the suit&#39;s systems.

&quot;Noin, aren&#39;t you in the wrong seat?&quot; Releena asked her worriedly, as 
she hesitated in front of the cockpit.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen your simulator scores,&quot; Noin said to her with a small 
smile, as she busily finished her own system&#39;s checks.

&quot;How did you find out about that?&quot; Releena asked with a blush as she 
climbed in and sat down to run through the preflight checklist like a 
pro.

&quot;I wondered who was sneaking in so late at night,&quot; Noin answered her 
casually, then she grinned, &quot;and beating the combat simulations.&quot; She 
reached over and hit a button on the control panel, the cockpit 
closed, and they were ready to go.

A low rumble from the engines, then they burst into motion, punched 
straight through the hanger doors and up and out into the night sky. 
&quot;Ooof!&quot; Releena gasped out softly, then she added &quot;Quite the 
acceleration on this thing!&quot;

&quot;Zero to mach one in almost ten seconds,&quot; Noin agreed. She touched a 
few buttons, then shook her head in disgust. &quot;They&#39;re so badly 
disorganized down there, they haven&#39;t even launched any pursuit 
vehicles yet.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Releena said dryly. &#39;Occasionally,&#39; Releena thought, &#39;Noin was 
a little too much the professional soldier.&#39;

&quot;All right, your point&#39;s made,&quot; Noin admitted ruefully. &quot;But I think 
it&#39;s been stuff like this that let the enemy succeed so well in their 
attacks against the Preventers. We got too sloppy,&quot; she said with a 
sigh. She checked the control panel, did some fast mental calculations 
and announced &quot;E.T.A. an hour, tops.&quot;

&quot;Noin,&quot; Releena said to her softly, then she stopped. Finally, she 
nervously asked &quot;What do we do now?&quot;

&quot;First we get in to the hospital and see Une, then we find out who 
inside the Preventers are the traitors,&quot; Noin said seriously.

&quot;I meant, about us,&quot; Releena clarified.

Noin was quiet a moment, then she said &quot;I want to be with you, if I 
can. I know our jobs will separate us at times, but as much as 
possible I want to spend my time with you.&quot; She smiled slightly, &quot;I&#39;ve 
found something good, and I don&#39;t intend to let you go.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Releena answered, blushing. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like 
us to marry again,&quot; she said, &quot;under our own names.&quot;

&quot;You really are a romantic,&quot; Noin said with a small smile. &quot;Will you 
marry me, Releena?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I&#39;d be honored, Lucrenzia Noin,&quot; Releena answered, taking the 
opportunity to tease her with her full name.

A soft groan from the suit&#39;s other cockpit, &quot;And you wonder why I use 
my last name.&quot; Releena&#39;s soft laughter brought a smile to Noin&#39;s 
normally severe expression. They quieted down as the trip continued, 
each occupied with their own thoughts.



Releena noticed that time seemed to slow to a crawl with a gun pointed 
at you, even if it&#39;s pointed by a friend of your&#39;s like Lady Une. The 
gun seemed very out of place in the sterile whiteness of the hospital 
room, along with those in the hands of several eager officers 
surrounding them. &quot;Damn,&quot; Lady Une said mildly, &quot;I was hoping we would 
catch an assassin.&quot;

&quot;I wondered why getting in the hospital was so easy,&quot; Noin said 
calmly, as Lady Une and several Preventer officers put their guns 
away.

&quot;Easy?!&quot; Releena said in disbelief, and brushed at the dust and 
garbage that covered her head to toe from their rather difficult 
entrance through the ducts.

&quot;Well, relatively easy, anyway,&quot; Noin corrected. She got serious as 
she looked over at Une, &quot;Who did this?&quot;

&quot;Hilde,&quot; Une sighed softly, her voice pain filled as she lay back down 
uncomfortably in the bed. &quot;She came in my office and then shot me, 
right before she set off the explosives she and her allies planted in 
Preventer headquarters. Aparently,&quot; Une added with a rueful smile, 
&quot;she wanted to make sure I didn&#39;t get out.&quot;

Noin just nodded grimly at that piece of news, but Releena looked at 
Lady Une in shock and disbelief. &quot;Hilde?&quot; Releena asked quietly. &quot;But, 
she&#39;s a friend, and she fought alongside the Gundams, why would 
she...&quot;

Noin sighed softly, &quot;I&#39;m very sorry Releena. People do change, even 
the one&#39;s we think of as our friends.&quot;

Lady Une added, &quot;I did some checking the last day or two.&quot; She sighed, 
waving her hand about, &quot;I haven&#39;t been able to do very much else in 
here. It seems Hilde has been taking on more and more dangerous 
assignments and actively taking greater risks. And most of them have 
been involving Mobile suit combat as well.&quot;

Releena didn&#39;t say anything, her expression deeply troubled.

&quot;Do we know what their objective is?&quot; Noin asked Une softly, her 
expression grim.

&quot;Hilde gloated a bit, figuring I was dead anyway. Apparently the &#39;Real 
Oz&#39; want to reignite the old conflicts and try to restart the war. 
They&#39;re going to use a figurehead to rally the colonies while they 
mobilize the Earth forces to war,&quot; Une explained.

&quot;So what will the figurehead be?&quot; Releena asked quietly.

&quot;We&#39;re not totally sure, but we know Hilde transfered massive 
quantities of Gundanium alloy to a unknown location. They also striped 
some parts and materials from the Tallgeese III, but exacly what they 
took we don&#39;t know. Another computer virus, this time in our main 
computer, deleted the data,&quot; Une said with a grimace.

&quot;Epyon,&quot; Noin said very softly. They both looked at her in surprise, 
and she elaborated, in a calm, almost deadpan voice &quot;They&#39;re 
rebuilding the Epyon suit, it has to be. It was the symbol of the 
Colonies&#39; opposition to Earth in the final battle of the last war, and 
after it disappeared the suit seemed to acquire an almost mythic 
status. The right pilot could use it to rally the Colony dissidents 
against Earth again.&quot;

&quot;Hilde will be the pilot,&quot; Releena said softly, &quot;if what you say is 
true, she&#39;d almost have to be. We&#39;ve got to stop her before she can 
contact the Colonies in Epyon.&quot;

&quot;But even the Peacemaker suits wouldn&#39;t stand a chance,&quot; Une said 
softly. &quot;They&#39;re not Gundams, and even a poor copy of Epyon would 
still be too much for them.&quot;

&quot;We need a Gundam of our own to face it,&quot; Noin said softly. &quot;But 
where...&quot; she started, then her eyes suddenly widened. &quot;The single 
pilot Peacemaker prototype!&quot;

&quot;We built it with real Gundanium alloy, for the initial test runs.&quot; 
Une said in a whisper. &quot;It&#39;s been mothballed, but it should still be 
in complete working order!&quot; she cried. She popped open her cell phone 
and began to bark out orders to pull the suit from it&#39;s storage and 
then to prepare it for immediate emergency launch.

&quot;Aso who do we get to pilot it?&quot; Releena asked worriedly.

Noin smiled slightly, knowing just how Releena was going to react to 
what she was going to say, &quot;I will.&quot; </pre>
