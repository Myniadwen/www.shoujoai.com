<h1>Intertwined (part 2 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kimmie.html">Kimmie</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gundam/inter-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Hey, Relena?&quot;

I scoot closer to her, trying to guard her from the cool chill of the 
air that seeps in under the doorframe. &quot;Yes, darling?&quot;

She turns toward me, her naked flesh soothing and exciting as it brushes 
against me. &quot;What would you say to going camping this weekend?&quot;

I laugh as her cold hands run along my side, feeling myself shaking 
slightly, but never pulling away from her touch. &quot;I&#39;d say that you&#39;re 
crazy because it&#39;s so cold. But, if you promise to keep me warm, I&#39;ll 
see if I can rearrange some meetings.&quot;

She pulls me closer, and I push in closer still. It&#39;s amazing, this 
relationship we have. It&#39;s not founded on anything that I thought 
relationships *should* be based on. I thought it had to be complicated, 
but this is so simple.... 

Oh, heavens... I&#39;m tearing up just thinking about it. What makes being 
with her so wonderful? It&#39;s not the sex... we haven&#39;t quite gotten to 
that point yet... just abject cuddling, gentle teasing, and sleeping 
naked in the same bed. Hardly anything innocent about it, but certainly 
nothing to brag about.

But, I don&#39;t want it to be about that, either. I want this based on 
uncommon things, rather than the common ones. In truth, I think she was 
my first crush. I mentioned that to her once, and she brought up Heero. 
But, Heero was a passing fancy. He was cute enough, mysterious enough, 
everything enough that he wasn&#39;t enough at all. It became almost a game 
to me to see if I could find him. I was a child then. The truth of the 
war had not yet hit me, so I was busy playing games. If I had known how 
many people were dying for causes! And, then I began to die for causes 
too. But, then I found someone nursing me back to life with simple 
words, and it&#39;s her. My dear Lucrezia....

But, when she brings up Heero, I bring up my brother. And she tells me 
that it was all a ploy to get to me. But, I doubt it. When she knew him 
first, I was barely cognizant of relationships between anyone and if 
she&#39;d loved me then, I would have felt her a pedophile. But, in times of 
war, and for long periods after war, age ceases to matter as feelings 
that have been deadened emerge anew. And, perhaps her feelings for 
Milliardo are like mine for Heero. Only, where I hindered Heero, she 
helped Milliardo.

It&#39;s funny how I can think so well when she&#39;s near me. My mind is 
overwhelmed with all the things that I want to do to her, but I hold 
myself back. The time will come, but it&#39;s not here yet. And, she 
inspires me. She takes my thoughts and they run through her and back 
through me and the cycle continues until I perfectly understand what 
must be done. The world may yet be a better place because we hold each 
other close.

I can only hope that the rest of the world can join together with 
everyone finding someone like I have. I couldn&#39;t be happier. And, Noin, 
my dear... without her, my nights would always be the same. She keeps me 
stable while making me try new things.

And, somehow through all of this, she made me begin to love her. I&#39;d 
thought it impossible, but this feels so right, it has to be love. I 
can&#39;t define it as funny little feelings in my stomach. I can&#39;t say that 
I get goosebumps. My blood does not race when she is near. But, when I 
think of her, the smallest things catch my attention and I find myself 
appreciating the beauty of the little things. When she drapes an arm 
across my shoulders, suddenly there&#39;s nothing I&#39;d rather be doing than 
spending time with her, even if it is in silence. That must be 
something. It must be.

And perhaps I&#39;m still a disillusioned youth, born into peace, raised in 
politics, maturing in war... but, I&#39;m still learning. And, if knowledge 
feels like this, give me all I can to try to absorb.

My love, without you... where would I be? I&#39;d have lost my temper 
without you there to catch my eye and the world might be in turmoil. 
It&#39;s awful tough having all the colonies and Earth look upon you as a 
role model and political figure. I&#39;d have lost it if not for her. But, 
she helps me figure out what to do. I&#39;m no president, just as I was no 
true queen of the world. I&#39;m no adult... though I&#39;m almost 18 now.

I&#39;d almost forgotten. It&#39;s only a few days until my birthday. How quick 
I am to forget the things that used to be important.

I look over at Lucrezia and see her fluttering eyelashes as she tries to 
drift off to sleep. I know the things that are important now. And, one 
of them will stay with me in the night.
