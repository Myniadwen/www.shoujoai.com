<pre>Moments later, Relena pushed away, looking into Hilde&#39;s eyes. &quot;Is this 
right,&quot; she asked the raven-haired girl..

Hilde simply stared at Relena and backed away, rolling out of bed. &quot;I 
don&#39;t know,&quot; she whispered and went into the bathroom.

Relena could hear Hilde crying. Her sobs were louder than the stream 
of water rushing from the shower, though Relena was sure Hilde didn&#39;t 
mean to be so blatant about her tears.

=Should I go in? I don&#39;t want her thinking.... I mean... I like her= 
&quot;It&#39;s wierd... but... I like her... I liked _it_!&quot;

She touched her lips gingerly and could feel the wetness at the crotch 
of her panties. A sensation that no one had given her besides Heero 
and he couldn&#39;t have cared any less about that if he tried.

&quot;This is too wierd,&quot; she said to herself and decided against going 
into the bathroom.

The _last_ thing she wanted was to make Hilde feel more uncomfortable. 

Hilde finally decided to come out of the bathroom. Wrapped in a towel, 
she headed straight for her duffle and dragged it back in with her. 
After getting herself dressed in a pair of denim shorts and cursing 
the shirts and blouses she chose to bring, she stepped out of the 
bathroom once again.

Taking several light steps to the window, Hilde stared out into the 
open space. Relena was not to be found; anywhere. The colony below 
looked almost as peaceful as earth. She sighed and placed her hand on 
her chest, hoping that would stop the tears from flowing but it 
didn&#39;t. They fell again as they had while in the shower.

&quot;God... Relena must think I&#39;m a total.... Ugh!&quot; she breathed heavily, 
disgusted. &quot;If she doesn&#39;t think I&#39;m totally gross!&quot;

She turned away from the window when her thoughts landed on a pair of 
violet eyes filled with awe and despair.

=No, Duo... I said good-bye and I meant it!= 

&quot;Then _DEAL_ with it!&quot;

Hilde turned around to see Relena enter the room, a mobile phone in 
hand. She clasped the thing shut and smiled wickedly.

&quot;I have just extended our leave,&quot; she spoke and tossed the phone 
across the room, into the bathroom and landing it into the toilet.

&quot;Nice shot,&quot; Hilde remarked to the &#39;plunking&#39; sound that the phone 
made in the ceramic bowl.

Relena laughed.

&quot;Grab your things, I have also moved us,&quot; she motioned for Hilde&#39;s 
bag.

&quot;Huh? I..&quot;

Relena reached for her own bag with a less than formidable smile. 
&quot;That&#39;s what happens when your brother, AKA: Head of security, tracks 
you down. It&#39;s not so bad being former Queen of the world.&quot;

Hilde _had_ to smile at that. &quot;Then where are we headed,&quot; she tried 
hiding her tears.

Relena stopped all her bustling activity. Her eyes met Hilde&#39;s and for 
an instant they held each other.

&quot;To find _you_ a new outlook on life!&quot; 

~~~*~~~ 

Three days later and a suite at the Inn of the Mountain Gods (1), 
Hilde and Relena were fine-tuned to each other&#39;s emotional pull.

&quot;This is amazing,&quot; Hilde radiated her astonishment as she basqued in 
the heat of the similated sun.

&quot;Great, huh?&quot; Relena agreed, handing Hilde a berry daqueri.

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

Relena smiled her welcome and began shedding her t-shirt and shorts. 
Hilde gasped a little at Relena&#39;s brave demure.

=Demure...= she laughed to herself.

&quot;WELL!&quot; Relena smiled.

Hilde nodded, and turned away at Relena&#39;s underclothing clad body.

&quot;More power to you,&quot; she whispered and closed her eyes.

Nothing had transpired since the first night of their arrival on L3. 
Hilde had secretly hoped but never persued and Relena desired but 
refused to alienate her only company.

&#39;The sun is so...&quot; Relena laughed at her own words. =The sun= she 
thought. &quot;This is _nothing_ like earth...&quot;

&quot;I know...&quot; Hilde spoke softly and stole a glance at Relena&#39;s near 
naked form.

&quot;Ah... escuse... Senora Relena...&quot; a timid voice called.

&quot;OH... What is it!&quot; Relena griped.

&quot;Senora... uh... menu para... comida...&quot; the woman replied, slightly 
embarrassed at seeing Relena in nothing more than a bra and panties.

Relena growled at the woman and rolled off her lounge chair. Moments 
later, the woman left the room with their menu for the evening meal.

Two hours later the two girls lingered over the food, talking and 
laughing about the last three days.

It was great, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

Relena nodded at the memory of the movie they had just watched and 
stared out over the moon-kissed landscape. It wasn&#39;t quite dark as the 
sun had set only moments ago and the night air brushed through the 
terrace cooling them from the grueling heat of the day. &quot;Who knew it 
could get so hot here!&quot;

Hilde smiled at Relena&#39;s words. &quot;I love it!&quot;

Relena smiled and took a piece of a soft taco and put it in her mouth. 
She noticed Hilde&#39;s brightened eyes as she did so and smiled inwardly.

&quot;Want some? I&#39;s really good.&quot; Hilde looked down at her half eaten 
plate of rice and beans. She&#39;d never had Mexican food before and liked 
it.

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;I dunno. Spanish rice... meat...&quot; Relena stared at the food on her 
plate.

&quot;Here...&quot; she said and slid over to Hilde, handing her the piece of 
tortilla and meat with rice. Hilde grabbed it, brushing lightly 
against Relena&#39;s hand. Her ice blue eyes met Relena&#39;s sea-green 
persuasion.

&quot;It&#39;s...&quot; she stammered for words, &quot;not... the food....Rele... na....&quot;

Relena had already read her mind and had pushed the food over with her 
foot. &quot;Is it... me... Hilde?&quot; Her voice was soft and a low whisper.

Hilde gulped a little, gasped for breath and nodded as Relena advanced 
on her. &quot;Y... yes... Relena...&quot; she whispered, moving backwards from 
the situated food.

Relena gently kissed Hilde&#39;s lips, gaining confirmation to move 
forward.

This was new to them both. Neither had ever experienced anything such 
as this before. Sexual pleasure? Yes. From a member of the same sex? 
Never! But how hard could it be? They could please each other as well 
as they could please a man.

Hilde melted into Relena&#39;s kisses and soft carresses and allowed the 
auburn hair to brush over her. Relena gained full access to Hilde&#39;s 
neck. She let her hands roam the body beneath her, exploirng the 
curves and contours.

Hilde found herself doing the same. Her hands glided over the soft 
material of Relena&#39;s clothes, her mouth open with excitement as Relena 
bit and nipped at her neck.

&quot;Lena...&quot; she breathed and gasped when Relena&#39;s hand found Hilde&#39;s 
crotch. &quot;Yes... Hilde...&quot; Relena breathed into the girl&#39;s ear as she 
undid Hilde&#39;s jeans. &quot;Lift,&quot; she whispered.

Hilde lifted her hips slightly so that the jeans could come off 
easily.

&quot;Hilde... you&#39;re beautiful,&quot; Relena whispered as she took in the site 
of the girl who was about to become her lover.

&quot;No,&quot; Hilde sighed and turned away. 

Duo had never told her that before. That he loved her or wanted her, 
yes, but never that she was beautiful.

&quot;Yes, Hilde...&quot; Relena smiled and bent down to kiss Hilde&#39;s knee. &quot;You 
are,&quot; she said and began to kiss lower.

She did not go far as she wanted to shed Hilde of the rest of her 
clothing and become free herself.

Hilde was shaking as she undid Relena&#39;s blouse, exposing the satin and 
lace covered chest. With unspoken permission, Hilde leaned forward and 
kissed Relena&#39;s neck. Soft hands moved her along, allowing her to suck 
on a tender spot on Relena&#39;s neck and quickly removed the bra, 
relieving Relena&#39;s breasts from the silky material.

Relena let her hand run through Hilde&#39;s hair as soft, moist lips 
tasted her hardened nipples.

Gently and tenderly, Hilde sucked on each breast, all the while 
removing Relena&#39;s shorts, leaving her only in satin underwear. While 
her lips and tongue danced around Relena&#39;s taught nipples, her hands 
found their way lower. One grabbing the firmness of Relena&#39;s back 
side, the other finding her fountain of pleasure.

Relena moaned her pleasure as Hilde tended her breasts and played at 
the door of her innermost desire. Sensing that Hilde would go no 
further, she moved just enough so that Hilde&#39;s finger slid just inside 
the folds.

&quot;It&#39;s ok...&quot; she whispered at Hilde&#39;s sudden tension. &quot;Just move...&quot; 
she smiled and pulled Hilde&#39;s head back to kiss her. 

Seconds later, Relena was writhing to Hilde&#39;s movements within her. 
&quot;Lee... I wanna taste...&quot;

Relena was on her knees and tightened as Hilde let her finger come out 
of the slick opening. 

Slowly, Hilde let her lips and her tongue find their way down to that 
moist flow and replace the movement as Relena laid flat on her back 
and held her knees, giving full access for Hilde to dive in.

Shyly at first, Hilde made her way down and then, once she found her 
treasure, she let her tongue play with the hidden jewel and then let 
her fingers fill Relena once again. Moments after that, Relena was 
arching her back as the waves of seduction and pleasure washed over 
her- but she didn&#39;t climax.

&quot;Let me...&quot; she breathed heavily, as she switched with Hilde.

Now _Relena_ was the one giving the pleasure, allowing Hilde to feel 
what she had just been given.

Her tngue darted in and around Hilde&#39;s muff as she played there, one 
hand playing as her middle finger invaded Hilde&#39;s private chamber and 
teh other playing with one of the girl&#39;s breasts.

&quot;Lee... oh God...&quot; she cried.

Relena smiled under her doings and played a little rougher, pinching 
and biting. Hilde was now arching her back as she waited for the final 
moment. Relena moved around and let herself down on Hilde&#39;s face.

&quot;Mmmm&quot; Hilde moaned and began where she had left off on Relena. The 
two young women played with each other until one, then the other came 
in the other&#39;s mouths.

Hilde moaning out hers as Relena did her magic and then Relena 
screaming out hers when Hilde took liberties of inserting her finger 
into the tight opening at the same time.

Seconds later, Relena rolled off of Hilde and lay flat, letting her 
hand rest on Hilde&#39;s stomach.

&quot;Lee...&quot; Hilde whispered.

&quot;Yeah, Hil?&quot; Relena sighed.

&quot;We need to leave our &#39;men&#39; more often!&quot;

Relena sighed and then giggled.

&quot;The beauty of walking away, Hilde, is the power of good-bye.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Hilde whispered and closed her eyes.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Relena replied, moving to pull a sheet over them both. &quot;The 
power,&quot; she whispered and kissed Hilde&#39;s temple. &quot;Good night, 
Beautiful.&quot;
