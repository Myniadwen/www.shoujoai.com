<a href="../gundam/revolution-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>The military facility was nearly empty, the buildings
silent and deserted as the lieutenant looked around
her before the black haired woman nodded to herself in
satisfaction. Noin turned, walked outside to where the
large transport jet patiently waited and climbed up
the stairs, smiling slightly as she nodded to the
pilot, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;.

&quot;I wish we didn&#39;t have to leave this facility behind,&quot;
Sally Po said softly, the brown haired woman sitting
in one of the chairs.

Noin climbed into the other seat in the mobile suit
transport, strapping herself in with easy confidence.
&quot;It&#39;s partially for operational security,&quot; she said as
the plane shuddered and began to roll forward, &quot;and it
looks like we might be ready to begin operations
soon.&quot;

With a thump they left the ground, the windows showing
the other planes rising with them. &quot;We&#39;d best know how
easy it is to transport the new Tallgeese models,&quot;
Sally agreed, tossing a look towards the back where
the mobile suits were.

Designated the Tallgeese II Noin&#39;s mobile suit had
been kept to the same basic configuration as Zech&#39;s,
with the heavy cannon and beam saber the suit&#39;s
primary weapons. The variations in the designs were in
the shield, which was both larger and triangular and
in the color scheme, done in red with a bit of black.
Along with it was Sally&#39;s modified Leo, both of them
carrying the stylized rose emblem of their new unit.

&quot;I&#39;m still not quite clear why we have a rose for a
emblem,&quot; Noin remarked.

&quot;It came from the top,&quot; Sally shrugged, &quot;from Treise
himself.&quot; She looked at the signet ring that Noin
wore, &quot;And it matches that, too.&quot;

&quot;Dorothy doesn&#39;t seem to mind,&quot; Noin conceded. She
frowned slightly, &quot;I wish the techs hadn&#39;t had to
sacrifice her shield unit to mount that chain whip
Dorothy wanted.&quot;

&quot;From what the tech boys tell me, the suit&#39;s speed and
maneuverability should help compensate,&quot; Sally
offered. She smiled slightly at her commanding
officer, &quot;Not to mention the fact we were able to
switch the old shield over to Lady Une&#39;s suit.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Noin agreed, &quot;and I guess that isn&#39;t
what is really bothering me.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Sally leaned forward in her chair to look
intently at Noin.

Noin looked vaguely troubled, &quot;Dorothy wasn&#39;t just
ruthless in the latest simulator runs, she was nearly
blood thirsty.&quot; She shook her head grimly, &quot;To stop a
Gundam she was perfectly willing to slaughter our own
troops, sacrificing them cold bloodedly.&quot;

&quot;Dorothy wouldn&#39;t sacrifice a fellow Tallgeese pilot,&quot;
Sally offered tentatively.

Noin&#39;s lips pressed together into a straight line, her
brown eyes narrowing. &quot;It shouldn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a
Tallgeese pilot or not,&quot; she shot back, &quot;we&#39;re all
soldiers.&quot; She shook herself, trying to restrain her
temper, &quot;Sorry, I just keep thinking of my trainees
and what might happen to them if Dorothy decides to
use them just for cannon-fodder.&quot;

Sally sighed but had to nod in agreement. &quot;We can&#39;t
remove her as a pilot, either,&quot; she said, &quot;Dorothy has
far too much influence for that.&quot;

&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Noin made a face, &quot;it&#39;s just
another thing that annoys me. The whole situation is
so damn political it&#39;s not funny.&quot;

&quot;There is some wisdom in completing all five Tallgeese
suits before fielding them against the Gundams,&quot; Sally
pointed out reasonably.

Noin snorted. &quot;No, it&#39;s a publicity coup for
Romafeller,&quot; she said dryly, &quot;they want it to be a
media event when the debut all five suits.&quot;

Sally looked like she wanted to say something, but
firmly kept her mouth shut.

Noin looked amused as she said, &quot;You have been around
me enough by now to know you can speak freely.&quot;

&quot;It is a new experience, ma&#39;am,&quot; Sally said wryly.

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Noin conceded.

The Specials were a very unique military organization,
but like all armies they had issues of order and
discipline. While speaking out about an issue wasn&#39;t
discouraged, saying the wrong thing in front of a
commander could be bad for one&#39;s career. Therefore a
young officer tended to get to know their commander
before expressing an opinion.

&quot;I was just going to say that it&#39;s kind of ironic that
the weapon&#39;s manufacturers involved with Romafeller
are touting the Tallgeese,&quot; Sally said to her wryly,
&quot;considering that it&#39;s based on much older
technology.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Noin agreed. She tilted her head to the
side, &quot;It&#39;s not really my area, but I was wondering if
you were able to find any of the engineers who helped
design the Tallgeese?&quot;

&quot;No luck in finding them,&quot; Sally looked mildly peeved,
&quot;the six main engineers who were involved seem to have
disappeared off the face of the Earth.&quot;

Noin had the oddest look on her face, &quot;Off the face of
the Earth...?&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; Sally looked at her worriedly.

&quot;It just hit me,&quot; Noin said softly, leaning forward as
much as the seat belts allowed. &quot;The Tallgeese was an
early design Mobile Suit, one abandoned because of
it&#39;s size and power,&quot; she said eagerly, &quot;now compare
it to the Gundams, who match or exceed it in size and
power.&quot;

It took Sally only a moment to see where her
commanding officer was going with this. &quot;You think the
engineers who created Tallgeese designed the Gundams?&quot;
she asked breathlessly. It was clear her thoughts were
racing as she said, &quot;The visual elements of the
designs are similar...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a theory, anyway,&quot; Noin made herself calm down,
though it wasn&#39;t easy. She took a breath, &quot;Can your
people get a hold of the engineers&#39; records, see if we
can find out if one or more of them migrated to the
colonies over the years?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll have people look onto it as soon as possible,&quot;
Sally smiled at Noin eagerly, &quot;and I can guess how
this information might help us. Any flaws or
weaknesses we discover in the Tallgeese might be
echoed in the Gundams.&quot;

&quot;It is just a theory,&quot; Noin hastened to caution her,
&quot;let&#39;s not get too wedded to the idea, just in case.&quot;
Her answering smile was devilish as she continued,
&quot;But yes, that is the general idea.&quot;

Meanwhile, in one of the other transport planes
Dorothy Catalonia took a small earplug out, coiling
it&#39;s cable up and putting it away with a compact
listening device. Bugging the other plane had been
merely a precaution, but it seemed to have paid off
for the regal blonde.

&quot;Trouble?&quot; Tubarov asked his niece warily. He had
played the game of intrigue for many years and
considered himself to be a good player, but Dorothy
had quickly demonstrated superior skills in that area.
Her ruthlessness seemed to hold no bounds, as did her
ambition.

&quot;No, an opportunity,&quot; Dorothy answered smoothly. She
smiled at the balding man as she said, &quot;It seems that
Noin has finally deduced what we already knew, the
connection between the Gundams and our Tallgeese.&quot;

&quot;Our people have several weeks head start in finding
them,&quot; Tubarov said confidently, &quot;we&#39;ll have the
engineers in hand first.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be overconfident,&quot; Dorothy&#39;s eyes flashed
angrily, &quot;they will have all the official resources of
the Specials behind their search.&quot; She drummed her
fingers on the arm of her seat, &quot;Have your people
plant some red herrings, just in case.&quot;

&quot;Does Mr. Treise really need these scientists so
much?&quot; Tubarov asked her as he hurried to use a
satellite connection radio to send out the messages.

&quot;I&#39;m confident that the Tallgeese ca face the Gundams
on even terms,&quot; Dorothy said smoothly, &quot;but we have no
idea what advancements the colonies have held in
reserve. If Mr. Treise is going to compete in the
Duels, he&#39;ll need a unique mobile suit.&quot;

&quot;A Gundam,&quot; Tubarov mused, &quot;on our side?&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Dorothy smiled unpleasantly.

As the mobile suit transport flew onward Dorothy sat
back as she considered what else she had heard. She
hadn&#39;t expected her actions in the simulator to bother
Noin and Sally Po so much, and she silently resolved
to tone it down in her training. Not that she&#39;d change
how she acted in the field, but maintaining the
illusion of a friendly relationship was a must.

&#39;When the time comes to finally defeat all my fellow
Duelists,&#39; Dorothy smiled to herself, &#39;I want it to be
completely unexpected.&#39;</pre>
