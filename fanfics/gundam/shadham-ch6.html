<h1>When the Shadow and the Hammer Fall (part 6 of 9)</h1>

<a href="../gundam/shadham-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re actually trying to steal a Peacemaker mobile
suit,&quot; Releena said anxiously, as she stood concealed in the shadows by
the partially open bay doors keeping watch for any soldiers on patrol.
She was dressed in an all-black flight suit; her helmet rested at her
feet and a small communication device was attached to her ear.

&quot;Welcome to a life of crime, my dear&quot; Hilde answered her over the radio.
&quot;I wish we could go through channels, of course, but the enemy must have
someone very high up in the Preventers to keep successfully pulling off
all their operations against us.&quot; There was the sound of a scrape of
metal on metal, a yelp of pain, and then some muffled, but creative,
curses. Finally, Releena heard a soft click! &quot;All right, lets go.&quot; Hilde
ordered.

Releena quickly walked into the hanger, but she slowed down a bit as she
looked over the Peacemaker suit. It had an overall look similar in
design to the original Wing Gundam and her brother&#146;s Tallgeese Mk. III,
but instead of the &#39;nose cone&#39; shield that suit had carried, on this one
a semi transparent crystalline matrix shield was used. A newly developed
technology, once the shield was powered up, it was nearly
indestructible. The beam canon also looked like it was pulled off the
Mk. III, but it&#39;s appearance was deceptive. Instead of an energy blast,
it fired an EMP wave, causing a disruptive effect in the electronics it
passed through, there by disabling the enemy, not destroying them, like
the suit&#146;s beam saber.

Releena took the lift up to the double cockpit, where Hilde waited. She
stood there in her own flight suit, as she looked up at the suit herself
Releena slowed to take a moment to appreciate the overall niceness of
the view of Hilde&#146;s slim, sexy body in the body hugging uniform that
matched hers.

Hilde noticed what she was looking at and blushed a little, before she
climbed into the lower navigation and flight control cockpit. She
gestured Releena over to the weapons seat above her. &quot;Grab your seat,
and let&#39;s go,&quot; Hilde said crisply, as she checked the suit&#39;s systems.

&quot;Hilde, aren&#39;t you in the wrong seat?&quot; Releena asked her worriedly, as
she hesitated in front of the cockpit.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen your simulator scores,&quot; Hilde said to her with a small smile,
as she busily finished her own system&#39;s checks.

&quot;How did you find out about that?&quot; Releena asked with a blush as she
climbed in and sat down to run through the preflight checklist like a
pro.

&quot;I wondered who was sneaking in so late at night,&quot; Hilde answered her
casually, then she grinned, &quot;and beating the combat simulations.&quot; She
reached over and hit a button on the control panel, the cockpit closed,
and they were ready to go.

&quot;The things people do to fight off stress and insomnia,&quot; Releena
muttered. 

A low rumble from the engines, then they burst into motion, punched
straight through the hanger doors and up and out into the night sky.
&quot;Ooof!&quot; Releena gasped out softly, then she added &quot;Quite the
acceleration on this thing!&quot;

&quot;Zero to mach one in 20 seconds,&quot; agreed. She touched a few buttons,
then shook her head in disgust. &quot;They&#39;re so badly disorganized down
there, they haven&#39;t even launched any pursuit vehicles yet.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Releena said dryly. &#39;Occasionally,&#39; Releena thought, &#39;Hilde was
a little too much the professional soldier.&#39;

&quot;All right, your point&#39;s made,&quot; Hilde admitted ruefully, &quot;but I think
it&#39;s been stuff like this that let the enemy succeed so well in their
attacks against the Preventers. We got too sloppy,&quot; she said with a
sigh. She checked the control panel, did some fast mental calculations
and announced &quot;E.T.A. an hour, tops.&quot;

&quot;Hilde,&quot; Releena said to her softly, then she stopped. Finally, she
nervously asked, &quot;What do we do now?&quot;

&quot;First we get in to the hospital and see Une, then we find out who
inside the Preventers are the traitors,&quot; Hilde said seriously.

&quot;I meant, about us,&quot; Releena clarified.

Hilde was quiet a moment, then she said &quot;I want to be with you, if I
can. I know our jobs will separate us at times, but as much as possible
I want to share my life with you.&quot; She smiled slightly, &quot;I&#39;ve found
something good, and I don&#39;t intend to let you go.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Releena answered, blushing. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like
us to marry again one day,&quot; she said, &quot;under our own names.&quot;

&quot;You really are a romantic,&quot; Hilde said with a small smile. &quot;I
understand if you want to take it slow Releena, but I hope one day I
can make you my wife and share the rest of my life with you,&quot; she asked.
As a professional solider, Hilde knew that her life might be cut short
at any time. This made that statement that much more meaningful in her
eyes. She would ride off to battle with her lady&#146;s silk scarf around
her armor, and would return it back in honor. Hilde Sheibeicker couldn&#146;t
think of any other lady&#146;s scarf to wear better then that of Releena
Peacecraft.

&quot;I&#39;d be honored, my knight,&quot; Releena answered softy, fighting back tears
of joy. They quieted down as the trip continued each occupied with their
own thoughts.</pre>
