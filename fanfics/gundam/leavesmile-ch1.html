<h1>She'll Leave You with a Smile</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/vegitoth.html">vegitoth</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This is a stray from what I&#39;m usually write but I&#39;m tackling some new 
direction. Relena will not have a flame for Heero for now but it&#39;ll 
happen in a sequel. Futhermore, Relena will commit herself to lesbian 
pleasure. Inspired by Shi-Chan&#39;s Desperately Wanting

Pairing Relena and Hilde. Implied 3x12 4xC 2xD Heero will  pair with 
Relena in a sequel.

//At first she&#39;s gonna come on strong
Like She&#39;ll love you all night long
Like it&#39;s going out of style
Then she&#39;ll leave you with a smile//

Catherine looked at the innocent girl sleeping in an overly large bed. 
The bed was usually meant for two, but the second...well, she wasn&#39;t 
there anymore.

Relena hardly stirred anymore. Never turned on the lights, never had the 
will to work, nor had the will to represent her people anymore.

Catherine let out a soft breath and began to close the door.

&quot;Catherine?&quot; came a soft whimper

&quot;Yes, &#39;Lena?&quot;

&quot;Can you keep me company for a while? Please?&quot; Her voice was filled with 
pain and loss.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll be happy too.&quot; Catherine walked to the girl who was now 
sitting on the bed. When she was an arm away, Relena reached up and 
pulled her friend close.

&quot;I miss her..&quot; she whimpered, &quot;I miss her so...I--&quot; she broked down

&quot;I know, Relena, we all miss her, but..&quot; now Cat&#39;s voice began to catch, 
&quot;she&#39;s gone, and she can&#39;t come back.&quot;

Catherine knew Relena had changed since Heero left after The Eve Wars. 
Ever since he disappeared, Relena relied on Hilde for pleasure and 
escape from the pain of her missing Heero.

When Relena exhausted her tears, she slept. Catherine ventured to her 
husband&#39;s room, because she knew Quatre would bring her out of pain.

//You&#39;re gonna give her all your heart
then she&#39;ll tear your world apart.
You&#39;re gonna cry a little while,
then she&#39;ll leave you with a smile.//

Relena slept and dreamt.

[lemon begin]

&quot;Come on, Relena, hurry up!&quot; cried the black haired girl as she ran to 
their private lake.

Relena shook her head and followed Hilde.

Out of nowhere, Hilde was beside her, &quot;Come on, Relena! Let&#39;s race!&quot;

Relena tried to reply, but Hilde was off at a dead start. The blonde 
took off as fast as she could. &#39;How does she run so fast yet so 
gracefully.&#39; her thoughts were interupted when she tripped over the root 
of an oak tree.

Hilde stopped and came to Relena&#39;s rescue and pounced on her. Her lips 
on Relena&#39;s and her hands stroking Relena&#39;s back passionately, 
desperately, and clinging to Relena like a lifeline.

Hilde let up her hold on the blond and Relena took advantage of the 
small release to get the upper hand.

She rolled them over and pinned the black haired girl to the ground 
while pressing her lips to the flesh of her neck. Hilde moaned at the 
sensations and her back arched, pressing their bodies together.

Relena slowly began to remove Hilde&#39;s buttons off of her sleeveless 
shirt, all the while exposing her soft torso. Hilde groaned for the 
fabric of Relena&#39;s shirt desperate to do away with the nuisance.

Both of them in their swimsuit tops, Relena pinned Hilde&#39;s arms down and 
gazed at her &#39;beauty&#39;.

The soft black eyes were burning up with desire at her from under her 
bangs. The soft lips, swollen from kissing, begging to be taken. Moving 
her gaze to her breasts, Relena took in the pale nipples and began 
sucking at them.

Relena letted go of Hilde&#39;s wrists and moved her hands to fumble with 
Hilde&#39;s clitoris. She heard the girl groan in frustration and teasingly 
smiled.

&quot;Relena...please...&quot; Hilde panted as Relena slowly made downward 
movements of her zipper. Relena decided that she teased the girl long 
enough.

She finished stripping away the girl of her clothes. Relena leaned 
foward and kissed her passionatly, and her fingers began teasing her 
nipples.

She leaned back to move her move to her breast once more, looking up at 
her lover when she came to her clitoris. Relena began to suck on that 
special jewel.

Pleasure violently shot everwhere around her body with every kiss Relena 
was sweetly making. But suddenly the pleasure was all gone and Hilde 
began to whimper without making a thought.

&quot;Shh, just bear with me.&quot; Relena murmured as she slipped out of her 
shorts so she can be in her full glory. Then Relena got out a black 
strap which included a fake member. Shortly after getting the strap on, 
Relena sanked her knees to the soft grass.

Suddenly, the blonde began to turn Hilde with her hands still on the 
grass. Relena began to enter her from behind and began thrusting gently. 
She also began to rub her hands all over Hilde&#39;s clitoris in order to 
feel twice more pleasure.

Her thrusts began speeding up and Relena was losing it. She fought to 
regain control, she didn&#39;t want to climax until Hilde did.

Suddenly, Hilde began to shriek her cumming pleasure which gave Relena 
the opportunity to follow her to the stars.

As the aftershocks subsided, they lay together on the sweet smelling 
grass, the wind having whipped the musky scent of sex from the area. 
Soon thereafter, they fell asleep.

[Lemon end]

Relena sat up in the bed. Her body covered in sweat and the room 
smelling bitingly of musk.

She grimaced and let herself fall back against the pillows. Letting 
sleep claim her once more.

//Well you can&#39;t help but wonder
Why you can&#39;t help but love her
But you can&#39;t help love her
And all that hurtin&#39; was more than worth it
It&#39;s written all over your face//

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hilde and Relena were at Relena&#39;s bedroom about to get ready for an 
intimate night together. But suddenly those plans were interupted when a 
gunshot went off at Relena&#39;s window. Hilde caught the bullet and fell 
down.

Relena instantly went to the phone and called 911. Shortly thereafter, 
Relena went and got her clothes back on and got Hilde&#39;s own back on and 
waited for the police and ambulance.

When they got to the hospital, the pain was first noticed as a bullet 
wound but when surgery got done, the pain only got worse. The bullet was 
poisoned.

Relena did the only he could do and called her friends. Duo, Trowa, 
Dorothy, Midii, Quatre, and Cathy all arrived in the hour, and Heero 
arrived thereafter.

&quot;Relena, we came as we heard.&quot; Cathy said raggedly, nobody had a way to 
console the girl.

Relena looked up at the red-headed girl, &quot;It&#39;s okay, Cathy. In a few 
weeks, she&#39;ll probaly want us to go to the beach.&quot;

&quot;Maybe she will.&quot; Duo knew she was keeping herself sane.

It was not to be. As a few weeks, Hilde&#39;s condition was reaching for the 
worst. Relena knew Heero was there with the others; at first they all 
thought, he would try to get in Relena&#39;s heart, but ironically he kept 
his distance and didn&#39;t talk to a single person.

Over the next few weeks, the ex-pilots and their wives (except Heero) 
took turns and hoped for the best.

As Hilde&#39;s life drained away, Heero often offered himself up for bedside 
duty, giving everyone a break. Never once did he try to mend Relena&#39;s 
aching heart.

As Hilde showed no signs of recovering, the doctors all but gave up 
hope. They&#39;d stopped the progress of the cancer, but the extent of the 
metastasis left it up to Hilde&#39;s will and body to try and recover now. 
It was beyond them.

//One day you&#39;ll pass her on the street
With that guy you used to be
She&#39;ll say hello and walk on by
Then she&#39;ll leave you with a smile//

Hilde showed *some* signs of improving and the doctors decided to see if 
she could breathe on her own.

&quot;If she holds on like she is, she should be just fine...&quot;

She did fine for a while, then something went wrong.

&quot;He&#39;s flatlining! Get the doctor!&quot; came the scream of a RN as the boys 
rushed into the room.

&quot;HILDE!!!!!!&quot; Relena screamed as the doctors piled in. Dorothy and Midii 
had to restrain her from rushing over to his lover&#39;s side.

&quot;Let them work!&quot; Dorothy yelled.

Relena watched in horror as the doctors hooked her back up and began to 
try and revive her. No matter how much she wanted to she couldn&#39;t tear 
her gaze from the pale ghost of an innocent that lay on the bed, dying 
she was sure.

Relena sank to her knees, she felt faint. The room became nothing but a 
roar of pictures and sound.

&quot;Nurse, get that IV to me now!&quot;

&quot;Doctor! She&#39;s regressing fast!&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t get a pulse!&quot;

Then all of the sounds left. All but the one that meant the end of 
Relena&#39;s happiness.

The long, shrill whistle of the flat lining heart monitor permeated the 
silence that had fallen over the room.Relena sank even further in on 
herself as she watched the doctor pull the sheet over her love&#39;s face.

As Hilde Schebecker died in body, Relena Peacecraft fell into a deep 
deep depression.

//Well you can&#39;t help but wonder
Why you can&#39;t help but love her
But you can&#39;t help love her
And all that hurtin&#39; was more than worth it
It&#39;s written all over your face//

Heero and the guys were at the main house. Relena definetly wasn&#39;t in 
the mood to deal with the man who walked out on her. Dorothy stood in 
her way when she found what Relena was going to do.

&quot;He helped with Hilde... you should give him a chance.&quot; Dorothy winced 
at the blonde&#39;s distant face.

&quot;Alright fine.&quot; Was all Relena could say.

Outside Heero and the boys were trying to light their spirits with 
conversations.

&quot;Hey, Relena.&quot; Heero said quietly as he entered the house.

&quot;Long time, no see.&quot; Relena said looking glum.

&quot;I was talking with the ladies and the gentlemen and we all knew how you 
were. From what I heard, you kept moping, crying, and you even resigned 
from ESUN. I think the best way for this pain to heal is for me to stay 
with you.&quot;

&quot;You dishonored my vow to her and her memory? So you can have my love? 
Have you forgotten who walked out on me after The Eve Wars?!?!?!?!?&quot;

This forced Relena to give Heero a life threatening slap on the face 
&quot;GET OUT OF MY SIGHT!&quot; she shrieked

Not changing his expression, he simply said &quot;As you wish.&quot; and walked 
out.

Relena broked down again after Heero walked out the door.

//At first she&#39;s gonna come on strong
Like She&#39;ll love you all night long
Like it&#39;s going out of style
Then she&#39;ll leave you with a smile//

A few months have passed, Relena was going to check her mail. But when 
she checked the mail the first one she saw was from Hilde. 

&#39;It&#39;s from a few months ago.&#39; she thought to herself.

When she got inside, she opened the letter and read:

Dear Relena,

Ever since I found out &#39;bout the bullet being full of poison, it didn&#39;t 
take me long to find out that I dont have that much long to live.

But as I&#39;m ready to pass into the afterlife, I want to ask you favor: 
When I die, I dont want you living on behalf of my memory, I want you to 
move on and be free. I know you still have a flame for Heero, I can see 
it in your heart and mind. I want you to go to him and love him from now 
on.

My final farewell,

Hilde Schebecker

Relena grasped at the letter. This was her last request to the blonde. 
Maybe she would have to fufill that request just for her.

&#39;If its a request you want me to fufill than I will do it, Hilde. But 
it&#39;ll be hard to get used to him again. But I&#39;ll do it for you.&#39;

Relena picked up her phone and dialed the phone number Heero left her a 
month after she yelled at him 

&quot;Heero, you can stay with me from now on.&quot;

Relena then sat at her desk and had only one more teardrop that was 
going to fall for Hilde but it would be the very last one before she 
thought &#39;Anything to make you happy, Hilde.&#39;

The End

//Ah, she&#39;s gonna love you
She gonna leave you with a smile//

---------------------------------------------------------- 

Dont worry everybody I still got the 1xR flame inside me but like I said 
I wanted to take my writing to a different direction. I&#39;ll be going back 
to the direction I started ever since I wrote fanfics this year. The 
sequel will not be shown until  November 11, 2005 the day I mark my 
first anniversary. The followup will be called A Friend To Me. See ya 
soon
