<h1>You and I</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alithea.html">Alithea</a><br> </h2>
<pre>He glanced up from his paper and glared at her for a good five minutes 
before returning his dark eyes to the news article he had been reading. 
It was a disapproving glance, and he continued to look up at her every 
so often, in the exact same manner, as she tried in desperation to 
drink her coffee. The young man was never one to just say what he was 
thinking unless provoked, or wrapped in the moment, but she wished to 
the gods he would just speak instead of staring at her like she was 
some sort of criminal. She gazed into the steamy depths of blackness, 
catching her off set reflection, pondering why she felt the need to 
even explain things to him. It wasn&#146;t his business what she did. It was 
her house and her life and she could do what she pleased. That was the 
reward for being a grown up after all. She took a sip from her cup and 
enjoyed the warmth of the brew as it slid down her throat. Her sky blue 
eyes finally managed to catch his just as he was about to resume 
reading the paper again. They had worked together long enough that he 
could read her sometimes-slight facial expressions with ease. And he 
saw clearly that he was being an annoyance but he really didn&#146;t care. 
It was his intent to get her attention and now that he finally had it 
he queried if he should speak or just let the heavy silence continue 
for a minute or two longer. She sighed and looked out the kitchen 
window. It was going to be another perfect sunny day. Not a cloud in 
the sky and it slightly disgusted her. She took a large gulp from her 
drink, smiling inside a bit at the role reversal. Wasn&#146;t she the one 
that tried to guide him? Wasn&#146;t she the one that proved even the weak 
had to fight sometimes? Even if they would lose sometimes the weak had 
to fight. She was the one that tried in desperation to focus all his 
misplaced views and anger. For the most part she was successful, but 
only because the scholarly side of him wanted to learn. Only because he 
wanted to understand the reasons why people acted as they did, and he 
still didn&#146;t understand&#133;and he still preferred solitude to human 
companionship&#133; but he was less volatile than he once was, and much less 
prone to judge without accessing a situation first. A slight breeze 
blew in from the open window and she pulled her robe closer to her. It 
was too early in the morning for this. Her head swung around as she 
glanced at the small and empty entrance to the room, her mind lingering 
on the previous evening. He took that as his cue and put his paper 
down. Before he could speak she replied defensively.

&#147;It is my life you know?&#148;  Her tone was light and cool. It was far to 
easy a voice for someone who had, and to a certain extent still, worked 
for the military. She pushed her light brown, almost blonde, hair back 
behind her ear, annoyed that she had undone her braids the night 
before. The night before, it still pulsed through her like a song. She 
shook her head and met his deafening glare once again. &#147;What can you 
possibly say or ask that I already haven&#146;t asked myself&#148;, she 
challenged.

He raised a dark eyebrow, but his over all facial expression remained 
the same, distant&#133;almost cold. &#147;I just want to understand why you do 
this to yourself&#148;, he stated flatly. He took a sip from his tea 
awaiting an answer. 

Her glance shifted over to the empty doorway once more, and then it 
moved to the ceiling. It was as if she was trying to look through the 
wall to find the answer.

&#147;So she&#146;s asleep then&#148;, he asked. &#147;She&#146;s still here?&#148; He seemed 
surprised. &#147;She actually stayed?&#148;

She wasn&#146;t comfortable with his line of questioning, but she couldn&#146;t 
lie. Nor could she just ignore the query. She sighed. Her focus 
drifting back to the young man in front of her. &#147;Yes.&#148;  It was a cold 
answer. 

He crossed his arms over his chest and nodded his head slightly. His 
disappointment was clear. 

She got a little angry at that point. &#147;Why does it even matter Wu-Fei? 
Why do you even care? I mean Jesus! How is this any worse than what you 
do on a regular basis?&#148;  Her eyes sparked of her own personal anger at 
herself. It was a mistake, she thought, it was a mistake but it&#146;s mine 
not yours. 

&#147;There is no attachment to what I do&#148;, he replied stiffly. &#147;I take and 
I leave and I can do that with no problems or fears. I don&#146;t need the 
sticky feel of guilt on me after I leave in the morning, nor do I need 
the harsh pangs of regret when I am left.&#148; He paused; his manner and 
tone very much unchanged from the first question he had asked. He sat 
up a bit and looked at her coolly. &#147;The difference is everywhere 
Sally&#148;, he chided. &#147;And it&#146;s different because you love her. I hate to 
say it&#148;; he paused ready for any reaction he would get. &#147;But she makes 
you weaker than you already are. She breaks you with her indecision, 
and you let her.&#148;

She nearly flew up and punched him in the face, but she managed to 
restrain herself. She managed to just grit her teeth, clench her fists 
and seethe in anger. But she knew he was right. She knew he was right 
and she just didn&#146;t want to hear about it. She had told herself the 
same things over and over again, but she just couldn&#146;t&#133;She couldn&#146;t say 
no. He huffed a bit and stood up. Bused his teacup over to the sink and 
folded his newspaper under his arm. 

&#147;I have to go or I&#146;ll be late&#148;, he stated. &#147;I assume I should tell Une 
you&#146;ll be in late today?&#148;

&#147;I have today off&#148;; she replied trying not to sound hurt or angry, or 
anything at all really. 

He nodded and walked out of the kitchen. He hated having to open her 
eyes even more to what she was doing, but it was necessary. She was 
strong and seeing her weak made him feel ill. It wasn&#146;t right for her 
to just accept things as they were going. It wasn&#146;t right to just wait 
for something to change. Change had to come through some kind of 
force&#133;through the destruction of something old to breathe life into 
something new. 

She sniffed as the door shut with a silent thud. It was killing her. 
Everything he asked and everything he said was true. But it was nothing 
she hadn&#146;t already told herself. It was nothing that she hadn&#146;t already 
been over time and again. She spent hours chiding herself about it, 
hours just arguing with herself over the stupidity of it all. She felt 
used and confused&#133;And it was worse that day because of what she had 
done the night before. It was so much worse because of that. She rose 
from the table and made her way slowly to the stairs. And as she made 
the small trek to her room everything felt heavy around her. She sighed 
again as she reached the door and she remembered how easy it was for 
her to fall. The night before she had run to the door upon hearing an 
all too recognizable knock. Another night of tears and long talks. 
Another night of whispered consoling and gentle advice&#133;because he had 
left&#133;again. For the millionth time he had gone with out a word or a 
trace, and for the millionth time Lucrezia Noin had run to Sally Po the 
one person who understood her, the one person who would always be there 
and listen and love her. It made Sally want to cry, because she did 
love violet eyed pilot&#133;Loved her to distraction. The sort of deep want 
and compassion that ate at her insides every time the crisis passed and 
she had to watch her love&#133;her dear and true friend&#133;the one thing she 
craved, wanted, needed&#133;When it all passed&#133;When the night was over&#133;When 
he finally returned&#133;Lucrezia always went back to him. She always went 
back and the cycle always repeated&#133;And Sally just couldn&#146;t stop it. But 
the cycle completely changed with last night. It evolved into something 
infinitely more complicated. She had been crying, and with just as much 
care as always the blue eyed medic wiped the pilot&#146;s tears away and 
held her tight. She listened to the Mediterranean beauty sob and rant. 
And as always she placed a polite kiss on her love&#146;s cheek, muttering 
that everything would be fine. The change was simple and slight as the 
skilled instructor lifted her head and kissed back. It was easy, light, 
soft and nothing strange, but it lead to a night of less innocence and 
solid aching lust. The world went up in flames and all reason was lost. 
She opened the door slowly and padded into her room. Her overnight 
visitor was still buried under the comfort of the bedding. She crept 
over to the bed and sat trying not to stir the woman next to her from 
sleep.  She wanted more time to think and ponder. She wanted to 
question herself more and more but all opportunity was lost as lazy 
arms wrapped around her waist pulling her close. She sighed, and blue 
eyes begged for release as sleepily eager hands parted her robe and 
began to brush against her soft skin. 

&#147;I can&#146;t do this again Luca.&#148; The nickname slipped from her mouth 
without a thought and her heart was a beat away from ripping in two as 
elegant tan hands kept up their work. Her eyes shut briefly and she 
whispered her plea again, &#147;I can&#146;t.&#148;  And she really couldn&#146;t. The 
memory of their last break up kept echoing in her mind. She couldn&#146;t 
stand to lose again. Not to him, and not to the wicked routine that 
seemed to constantly bind them. 

There was a breathy sigh released from the woman holding her. It was 
almost annoyance, but it seemed more like realization. She sat up, 
pulling a white sheet over her bare form. Lusting fingers ran through 
her short dark hair and her violet eyes looked to the ceiling sadly. &#147;I 
have to choose don&#146;t I?&#148;  It wasn&#146;t clear if the question was meant to 
be answered immediately,  or left to linger for at least a minute in 
silence.  She shifted a bit moving to her side and looking over at 
Sally ran a light hand down the lovely Preventor&#146;s face. &#147;Of course I 
have to choose&#148;; she replied weakly and caught the woman&#146;s tears with 
her lips. It was a terrible thing choosing. It meant someone would lose 
and Lucrezia couldn&#146;t help but feel that she would lose the most. She 
inched away as Sally left the bed.

&#147;I&#133;I&#146;m gonna take a shower&#148;, pleading blue eyes stated. &#147;And then we 
can talk.&#148;

&#147;Fine.&#148;


Have I lost you&#133;
I have lost you
To the wind and to the rain
Have I lost you
I have lost you
And there is nothing that can be the same
And why leave me this way
And why let me wander
&#145;Cos I wander
Have I lost you
I have lost you
To the beating of my heart

There was a chill in the air that she hadn&#146;t expected. Perhaps it 
wasn&#146;t really the weather. She sat on the porch swing waiting for Sally 
to join her. Knowing that she had to do damage control and knowing that 
she took things to far. Her violet eyes shut for a moment so she could 
think without the sunny day intruding and she wondered briefly, if she 
had broken everything on purpose.

&#147;It&#146;s cold out.&#148;

&#147;Hmmm&#133;I thought it was just me&#148;, she replied. She looked over at Sally 
and forced a half smile.

&#147;Where do we start Luca?&#148;

&#147;Not sure. I suppose...we should start with us&#148;, the pilot replied 
warily.

&#147;The first time we lasted a solid six months&#148;, Sally began. &#147;The second 
time&#133;&#148;

&#147;Over a year&#133;but then&#148;, she paused remembering the why. Why they didn&#146;t 
last&#133;it always went back to him. He was why she could never stay. He 
was why she left and returned. And he was why she made such a mess of 
things the other night. She shook her head. &#147;It begins and ends with 
him Sal&#133;it always has.&#148;

&#147;You love him?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;Has he ever told you?&#148;

&#147;Not those three words&#133;he&#146;s never been able to.&#148;

&#147;No?&#148; She looked away trying to bite back her anger. It was stupid the 
triangle that had evolved. It was stupid and it bound them in ways that 
shook her soul.  &#147;He always leaves you.&#148;

&#147;But he comes back.&#148;

&#147;Because he knows you&#146;re waiting&#133;just like you know I&#146;m always 
waiting&#133;and I can&#146;t&#148;, she sniffed back some tears. &#147;I can&#146;t keep 
waiting for you&#133;and if you love him&#133;You love him&#148;, she choked. It was a 
realization that stung. She leaned up against the wall as she began to 
sway from the impact of the self-inflicted wound. 

&#147;Sally, we&#146;ve fallen under a curse it seems. I am to you what he is to 
me&#148;, she stood up and looked out at the street. &#147;I think&#133;I think I have 
to stop waiting too.&#148;

&#147;So you&#146;re going to chase then?&#148; She did her best to remain still and 
unmoved. But deep inside she just wanted to scream. It wasn&#146;t fair. 

Lucrezia Noin stepped in close to her friend. She brushed back her hair 
and suppressed a sigh. &#147;Stop waiting for me Sally.

The choice was made. It was clear and solid and she knew it would 
stand. 

I need to know if you go
If you leave and never return
If I&#146;m left with only the burn
What kept you from my heart?
What tore us apart?
I broke under you
And you knew
You knew what to do


The sun was setting in a hazy calm manner and as he walked up the steps 
to the house he quirked an eyebrow. She looked pathetic sitting there. 
Like a dog waiting for her master to return home. He said nothing 
though. He took a seat next to her.

&#147;She won&#146;t come back.&#148;

&#147;Hn.&#148;

&#147;And I&#146;m not waiting&#148;, she stated strongly. 

&#147;Never said you were&#148;, his tone was cool.

&#147;And a single heart break does not make a person weak.&#148;

He shook his head, not so much in disagreement, but in sadness. It 
wasn&#146;t right for her to be this way. It wasn&#146;t right at all. But he 
said nothing. He just waited.
