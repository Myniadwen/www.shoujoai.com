[Here I go again I promised myself I 
wouldn&#39;t think of you today
It&#39;s been seven months and counting
You&#39;ve moved on 
I still feel exactly the same way]

Did she ever realize the hold she had over me? Did she? My Sally Po, my 
love. How much I love her, even now. Despite the fact that she is gone, 
I can&#39;t get her off my mind. Every time I promise myself that I won&#39;t 
think about her, I do. Everything that I felt still exists. The joy of 
when I see her; the memories of our lovemaking; her taking me, and me 
becoming hers and no one else&#39;s. Does she realize what she has done to 
me?

[It&#39;s just that everywhere I go all the buildings know your name
Like photographs and memories of love
Steel and granite reminders
The city calls your name and I can&#39;t move on]

I put on my Preventer uniform and leave our...my apartment. You know the 
pillows on the bed still smell like you. I relish the fact that they do. 
The only thing I have left besides the photos of us together. I keep a 
stiff upper lip and don&#39;t cry; I won&#39;t cry. I must be strong.

I leave my apartment walking outside to get to work. Taking the same 
path I&#39;ve taken for years, the only difference is, you&#39;re not with me. I 
pass the restaurant where we went on our first date. You were in a 
sparkling black gown and me in a woman&#39;s tux. We received rude stares 
but it was all worth it just to be with you. I look away from the 
restaurant and keep walking, passing another building of remembrance, 
the same building where we made love for the first time. I stop dead in 
my tracks and stare at the building; I can&#39;t believe it. I can&#39;t forget 
you. 

[Ever since you&#39;ve been gone
The lights go out the same
The only difference is
You call another name
To your love to your lover now
To your love
The lover after]

I remember the day I came home early from work. It&#39;s so clear to me, I 
walked up to the door and pulled out the keys to open the door but it 
was already open and slightly ajar. I couldn&#39;t help but wonder what it 
was doing open, instinct told me that someone could be in our place 
robbing us, so I quietly pushed the door open and walked in. I heard a 
soft groan from the bedroom, so I walked towards it. I peek through the 
small crack and find you in bed with someone else. I was shocked, 
because this is you we&#39;re talking about, you&#39;d never do such a thing but 
I was wrong. You were in bed with none other than the woman we report 
to, Lady Une. I was heartbroken, even more so when you cried her name 
after she made you come. I slammed the bedroom door shut and ran out of 
the apartment. I heard you run after me and call my name but I couldn&#39;t 
stop I was too hurt, too confused. Sally, why?

[Am I all alone in the universe?
There&#39;s no love on these streets
I have given mine away to a world that didn&#39;t want it anyway]

I had given you all my love, I had given you my heart, and soul and you 
threw them away like they were worthless trinkets. I can&#39;t believe you 
did that to me, Sally. You knew you meant the world to me and yet you 
still did this to me. I can&#39;t believe this has all happened, it&#39;s still 
so much like a dream to me and I pray each day that I&#39;ll wake up and 
find out that it&#39;s not true and we&#39;re still together. You&#39;ve broken me 
Sally, heart, body, and soul. 

[So this is my new freedom
It&#39;s funny
I don&#39;t remember being chained
But nothing seems to make sense anymore]

I&#39;m single again. Anou...the dating pool. Like I know what that is, do 
you know what it&#39;s like to go to a bar and be hit upon by men and women. 
Most of the time I find myself waking up in bed with some unknown 
person. Yet every morning you still appear in my memory. During sex with 
anyone else I replace him or her with you. I am hooked on you. Nothing 
could make sense to one like me who is so hopelessly lost in the 
emotions of sadness and pity. What ever shall I do? 

[Without you I am always twenty minutes late]

Now more than ever, I find myself not caring about my life. I&#39;ve popped 
off to Une and everyone else so many times that it never ends. I&#39;m 
constantly late to work, and everywhere else. Nothing matters anymore to 
me. I don&#39;t care; I just want you back. To bad that&#39;s not going to 
happen. You packed your stuff, moved out, and moved in with Une. What 
was I to you? A good lay? 

[Ever since you&#39;ve been gone
The lights go out the same
The only difference is
You call another name
To your love 
To your lover now
To your love
The lover after]

Late at night now, I find myself touching myself, imagining it to be 
you. It doesn&#39;t work because every time in my fantasies you call out 
*her* name, not mine. The shadows of the moonlight play across my 
sprawled out figure. I moan your name but I don&#39;t hear you say mine; it 
hurts so much. Why do I have to suffer?

[And time goes by so slowly
The nights are so cold and lonely]

Weeks pass by as slow as ever, nothing happens quickly anymore. I wish 
time would just speed up so I could get over you. I don&#39;t need you 
anymore! I DON&#39;T!

[I shouldn&#39;t be holding on
But I&#39;m still holding on for you]

I can&#39;t help but think of you. You&#39;re in my every thought. I can&#39;t rid 
myself of you, you there no matter what I do. You&#39;ve put a spell on me, 
a strong one. I&#39;m yours, Sally, and no one else&#39;s. I hope you realized 
that, even though you did leave me. You own my heart and you took it and 
shattered it.

[Here I go again
I promised myself I wouldn&#39;t think of you today
But I am standing at your doorway
I&#39;m calling out your name because I can&#39;t move on]

I finally reach the Preventers office; I&#39;m late as usual. So I don&#39;t 
even bother for her to call me to her office. I&#39;ll just go ahead and pay 
Une a visit now and get it over with. I walk up to her door and open it, 
to you spread out on her desk. I...I can&#39;t believe it, not again! Tears 
befall my eyes and I begin to weep. I cry out your name softly but not 
loud enough for you to hear. I can&#39;t move; I&#39;m frozen in place. Une 
takes you to the point on her desk. You&#39;re tossing your head back and 
forth, that&#39;s when you see me. I know you can see the hurt in my eyes 
but all I see in your eyes is passion.

[Ever since you&#39;ve been gone
The lights go out the same
The only difference is
You call another name]

She makes you come and you moan her name loudly. My god, Sally, I wish 
that was me in your place and you doing that to me but it&#39;s not. I turn 
around and run away again, this time for good. I can&#39;t face this 
anymore; I will let you go this time, forever. There&#39;s just one thing I 
want you to know Sally, no matter what, no matter who you are with, I 
will always love you, regardless of the things that have come between 
us.

[To your love
To your lover now
To your love
The lover after]
