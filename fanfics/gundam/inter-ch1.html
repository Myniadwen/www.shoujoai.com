<pre>Notes: What you are about to read is a true story. The names have been 
changed to protect the innocent, the adorable, and the absolutely 
wonderful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

It feels so nice to have her here. I&#39;ve got her tucked near me, one of 
my arms draped across her stomach, and we&#39;re quiet, even though no one 
else is.

It&#39;s Hilde Schbeiker&#39;s birthday party. We&#39;re having a sleepover of 
sorts. I don&#39;t know Hilde well, but my current lover is her cousin. The 
original plan for this was merely to stay up all night reliving our best 
childhood memories, but with my love here, I can&#39;t help but move past 
them, since now is better than then.

Lady Une is curled up smiling at the end of the bed, but she keeps 
complaining that we won&#39;t let her light up all the candles in the house. 
I should have guessed that Lady Une was a pyromaniac. Hilde is laying on 
the other side of the bed. She just can&#39;t keep still. But, it&#39;s her 
birthday. She&#39;s allowed to be excited... but, we&#39;re on a waterbed. 
Mariemaia Khushrenada is staying in Hilde&#39;s room, with Sally Po, at the 
moment. But, they&#39;ll both be in here before the night is through. 
However, they&#39;re playing some trivial board game with Duo Maxwell. I can 
only wonder... he&#39;s so anxious to be here, and yet he&#39;ll gladly take 
away the few small annoyances that might have otherwise ruined out 
evening. (Mariemaia, when she&#39;s sleepy, is very rude.) And, then, here 
we are... Lucrezia Noin trying for slumber in the arms of Relena 
Peacecraft.

But, I&#39;m surprised. With so many of us in here, the room is positively 
scorching, but she scoots closer to me anyway. Though, we&#39;re not lacking 
for space on the huge bed.

I think it&#39;s been a nice night so far. We had our pizza, then cake, gave 
Hilde presents, played video games for a while, then watched a Mel 
Brooks marathon. Lucrezia has the most adorable laugh the world may ever 
hear. I&#39;m sure of it now. But, we&#39;re all regretting a few littles 
things. Dorothy Catalonia... the dear girl was invited. She was even 
supposed to get a ride from Lucrezia, oh, pardon. I barely notice I call 
her that. She hates it. She encourages me to call her Noin. So, for her 
sake, I will. But, back on topic, Dorothy, at the last moment, got food 
poisoning. She&#39;s recovering at home now. She called earlier to wish 
Hilde a happy birthday and to tell her to expect her gift in the mail. 
But, Heero Yuy isn&#39;t here either. I think Hilde invited him because of 
Duo, but I can&#39;t be sure. I know that I was only a last-minute addition 
to the guest list, but I&#39;m happy to be here.

I should care more about what is going on around me. But, I don&#39;t. I&#39;m 
in a place where I&#39;m not known as anything but Vice Foreign Minister 
Dorlan, except to Noin. She&#39;s my saving grace here.

A police car just drove past outside blaring it&#39;s sirens. Everyone is 
suddenly rowdy again. I feel like I&#39;m going to be tossed off this 
waterbed. Who invented the damned things anyway? They&#39;re quite 
inconvenient. Oh, hell, they&#39;re more than inconvenient. They&#39;re a 
frickin&#39; nuisance. Hmm... I can&#39;t even bring myself to curse like a 
sailor in my *mind*. She&#39;s tamed me. I&#39;ve known her for a while, but in 
the past few weeks, things just suddenly came together and I&#39;m glad.

I can hear Duo just outside the door cracking jokes with Sally and 
Mariemaia. The door will open in just a moment. I do believe that I 
won&#39;t be getting any sleep tonight.

But, for now, just to have her in my arms is enough. It will make up for 
possibly falling asleep tomorrow during the annual peace talk with the 
L3 colonies.

I look around in the dimly-lit room at these people who helped me win a 
bit of my ideals and think of how much other people have helped as well. 
And then I think of myself and how happy I am at the moment with this 
beautiful woman in my arms. This war is over. Another may soon start, 
but, for now, I&#39;m happy with this life.

I shower kisses on Noin&#39;s neck as I hear the door begin to creak open. 
She shifts softly and almost coos at me, just enjoying the feeling, I 
guess. But, I do notice something about this that makes all the 
difference. Despite the fact that she&#39;s a good amount older than me and 
I&#39;m surrounded by people whom I don&#39;t really know well enough to call by 
their first names, I&#39;ve got my own peace. And, I notice that she fits so 
divinely in my arms.

The light flickers on and Duo romps in. She groans and shifts, 
unconsciously moving even closer still, nuzzling back into me with a 
sigh and a sleepy grin.

Ah, yes. So divinely.
