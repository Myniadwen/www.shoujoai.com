<h1>Failure of Vision (part 3 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rzrblade.html">Rzrblade33</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gundam/failure-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Duo Maxwell arrived yesterday, looking very much like a lost puppy.

I can&#146;t say that I&#146;m entirely surprised at his unannounced visit. He 
has always been so obsessive over Heero. His feelings are common 
knowledge; everyone &#150; with the exception of Heero himself &#150; knows 
about it. I had wondered often how the American would take Heero&#146;s new 
job when it meant moving far away to live with Relena. I thought that 
perhaps he would feel helpless and possibly heartbroken.

But I did not at all expect to open the door on a Friday afternoon to 
find wide purple eyes staring at me from underneath unruly bangs.

&quot;Dorothy-chan!&quot;

He moved to hug me as though we were friends being reunited after 
years apart, as though we hadn&#146;t been enemies only a few months ago. I 
stepped back away from his arms and glared at him, effectively ceasing 
his movements.

He lowered his arms quickly and cleared his throat. &quot;I mean&#133;hello, 
Dorothy.&quot; His voice was laced with mirth and his eyes glinted 
playfully.

I frowned and took another half step backwards, looking him over 
closely. His braid is still obnoxiously long, I noticed immediately. 
Men with such long hair are rare and stand out far too much to be 
useful. But I find that I can&#146;t imagine Duo without it. He has also 
given up his priest outfit; I give him points for this. Of course, 
he&#146;s replaced it with leather pants and a horridly tight shirt. He 
therefore looses said points.

Americans. I rolled my eyes inwardly.

He stared at me, observing me while I did the same to him. His smirk 
eventually widened as he spoke in a loud, laughing voice. &quot;You know, 
Dorothy, I&#146;ve always wondered&#133;how do you get your eyebrows to do 
that?&quot;

I blinked at him indignantly and moved to finger one of my eyebrows.

&quot;I mean, do you gel it or something? I think that you&#146;d almost have 
to, to get it to fork like that.&quot;

Duo cocked his head momentarily before continuing relentlessly.

&quot;Unless of course they&#146;re natural. In which case, I would just like to 
ask you if you&#146;ve ever heard of tweezers. Because that&#146;s just 
disturbing.&quot;

I opted not to respond, partly because I consider myself to be above 
exchanging childish remarks with a boy from L2 and partly because I 
knew perfectly well that he was about to make a point.

&quot;Not exactly pleasant is it, Dorothy, to have someone degrade your 
appearance.&quot; There was no bitterness in his voice, only cheerfulness.

&quot;I didn&#146;t say anything about your appearance.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#146;t have to; your face says it all.&quot;

I was fairly impressed by his observation and quite a bit surprised. I 
briefly considered complimenting his skill before I stopped myself. I 
do not compliment Duo Maxwell, no matter what the circumstance may be.

&quot;You know, I think that you&#146;ve been around Miss High and Mighty for 
far too long,&quot; he said, rocking back and forth on his heels.

I didn&#146;t get a chance to reply as both Heero and Relena entered the 
room. I noticed her hand on his arm and the way her smile seemed 
strained when she caught a glimpse of our guest, and I smiled.

&quot;Hee-chan!&quot;

Duo launched himself full-force at the other boy, his legs wrapping 
around Heero&#146;s waist. Heero looked none too pleased but nevertheless 
held his arms around Duo awkwardly.

Relena&#146;s smile didn&#146;t falter even slightly; I was disappointed. &quot;Good 
afternoon, Duo. To what do we owe this visit?&quot;

Duo disengaged himself and gave her his brightest grin. I wondered 
idly if I was the only person present who noticed the mocking tone he 
suddenly took on. &quot;Well, I was talking to Quatre the other day and he 
asked how you two were doing and I realized that it had been a very 
long time since I&#146;d seen either of you. So I thought I&#146;d pay you guys 
a surprise visit. I hope you don&#146;t mind.&quot;

&quot;Not at all. You&#146;re welcome here any time.&quot; The lack of enthusiasm 
spoke for itself. &quot;I&#146;ll have Dorothy take you up to a room.&quot;

I began to respond when I was interrupted.

&quot;I&#146;ll take him.&quot;

Relena and I could only stare in shock as Heero turned quickly after 
speaking and walked toward the direction of the stairs, Duo trailing 
behind him with his bulging suitcase and a self-satisfied smirk 
written plainly on his lips.

I spoke after a moment, turning my head slightly and clapping my hands 
together gleefully. &quot;Oh, this is going to be such a lovely weekend, 
isn&#146;t it, Miss Relena?&quot;

She was silent. Her fingers twitched lightly, and I could see her 
chest rising and falling with each breath. Finally her gaze shifted so 
that it met mine. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said. &quot;Yes, I believe that it is.&quot;

Her eyes burned into mine, and I realized that the night would be 
quite a long and remarkable one.

And it was.

I could taste her jealousy.
