<a href="../gundam/truprot-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>She made her way through the doors, flashing her ID at the front desk 
as she walked right by. She knew the way though the twisting hallways, 
eventually reaching the large inner courtyard. Lush greenery of many 
kinds helped to create the illusion of some privacy, but concealed 
windows and carefully hidden cameras allowed them to watch everything 
that went on there. A path led her to a bench, and she stood there a 
moment beside another girl sitting there.

&quot;Good morning, Hilde,&quot; Noin said to her quietly.

Hilde smiled up at her shyly, her hands cradled in her lap. She was 
very pale, and was made even paler by the dark green pants and top she 
had to wear. A medical monitoring device was strapped to her slim 
wrist, it&#39;s soft sounds fading to the background as they talked.

&quot;Good morning, Noin,&quot; Hilde answered her softly. She extended a hand, 
which shook slightly, even as she struggled to try and keep it steady.

Noin took it, gently shaking her hand before letting Hilde tuck it 
back into the safety of her lap. &quot;The doctors tell me you&#39;re making 
real progress with your exercises,&quot; she said softly, sitting down 
beside her on the bench.

&quot;The physical therapy is helping,&quot; Hilde agreed softly, &quot;I can write 
out my name now.&quot; She looked over at Noin sadly as she continued, &quot;But 
I still can&#39;t remember anything.&quot;

Noin tried not to wince at that. It had taken several long months for 
Hilde to come out of her coma, and when she finally awoke her memory 
was completely gone. Specialists were brought in, test were run, and 
it was quickly determined that her amnesia was for real, not an act. 
She really didn&#39;t remember anything, to Hilde&#39;s own great distress.

Her nervous system was also very badly damaged, so even as they began 
to treat her physical damage they tried to determine all the effects 
on her mental state. She seemed to be almost a totally blank slate, 
with no memory of anything that happened to her before waking up that 
first day in the hospital. She could talk, read, and probably write, 
though the shakes she had when she woke up prevented that. But other 
than that...

The thin girl looked at her, her eyes dark. &quot;Who are you, Noin?&quot; Hilde 
asked her softly, right out of the blue. Noin looked up at her in 
surprise, as Hilde continued on saying quietly &quot;I still don&#39;t know 
anything about you, other than your name.&quot;

&quot;You know I can&#39;t tell you that,&quot; Noin said, &quot;we need to give any of 
your original memories the chance to resurface, rather than giving you 
any second hand information.&quot; Noin smiled wryly as she added &quot;I had to 
argue with the doctors just to let me tell you my name.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for that,&quot; Hilde said softly. She sounded so grateful for 
such a small kindness, really, that it made Noin feel a bit 
uncomfortable.

Hilde looked off across the greenery of the courtyard, and after a few 
moments of silence she said, &quot;I do wonder, sometimes, what it was that 
I did. I know I&#39;m being held captive here, as well as being treated 
for my injuries. I think it must have been something pretty bad, 
though,&quot; she looked over at Noin sadly, &quot;I know you can&#39;t tell me.&quot;

Noin sat there silent, unsure what to say to her. Sometimes Noin found 
herself hoping that Hilde wouldn&#39;t regain her memory, it might be 
better for her.

Hilde smiled sadly, &quot;I&#39;m just glad you come visit, you and the quiet 
lady.&quot;

&quot;What quiet lady?&quot; Noin asked her in surprise. She knew no one else 
was authorized to see Hilde other than the medical staff treating her.

&quot;She never comes inside, just parks her car on the street. I can see 
her from my room sometimes, she has long brown hair, and looks a 
little sad,&quot; Hilde said. She looked thoughtful, &quot;Or maybe regretful.&quot;

&#39;Lady Une,&#39; Noin thought, &#39;it must be.&#39; Before she could say anything, 
her watch chirped softly to get her attention. Noin looked down at the 
message there and scowled before saying, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I have to go.&quot;

&quot;Duty calls, I guess,&quot; Hilde said with a sad little smile. As Noin was 
walking off, she softly said, &quot;See you next week.&quot;



Releena sighed softly, pacing the dark office hallway impatiently. She 
had come down to try and surprise Noin, but a major crimp had appeared 
in her carefully thought out plans: it appeared Noin was trapped in 
the meeting from hell.

According to Lady Une&#39;s secretary, she, Noin, and most of the 
Preventers&#39; brass were behind closed doors with one of their greatest 
opponents: the government accountants. Releena almost felt sorry for 
Noin as it was likely that she and Une were being forced to justify 
every expenditure for the past year, down to the nuts and bolts if 
needed.

&quot;Looks like you&#39;re here waiting as well, Ms. Releena,&quot; a familiar, and 
quite amused sounding, voice said from behind her. She turned to see 
Dorothy Catalonia standing behind her, a pleasant smile on her face. 
&quot;Would you like some tea while we wait?&quot; she invited.

Releena chuckled softly, &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot; She followed Dorothy to two 
plush chairs, the tea already set up for two. She raised her eyebrow 
at Dorothy inquiringly.

&quot;One of the guards saw you pacing,&quot; Dorothy explained. She poured the 
tea neatly, then sat down across from Releena. She smiled wickedly, 
&quot;How&#39;s married life been for you?&quot;

&quot;No complaints,&quot; Releena said with a contented smile. &quot;Are you and Une 
planning to settle down any time soon?&quot; she asked in return.

Dorothy took a small drink of her tea. &quot;I suppose it will have to 
depend on how the adoption arrangements go,&quot; Dorothy answered her 
calmly.

&quot;Adoption?&quot; Releena echoed, sounding more than a bit confused.

&quot;Well, we couldn&#39;t just leave Mariemea with the Barton family, could 
we? Une was already making the arrangements when I entered the 
picture, and I support her completely,&quot; Dorothy said with a little 
smile. She looked up from her tea to see Releena&#39;s reaction.

Releena gaped at her, almost like her brain had derailed at the 
thought of Dorothy and Une raising a young girl together. She shook 
her head, &quot;I hope you know what you&#39;re getting into. I spent a few 
days with her, and she&#39;s one of the most... intense children I&#39;ve ever 
met.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Dorothy said with a fond smile, &quot;that&#39;s one of the things I 
most like about her.&quot; Releena laughed softly, and they settled down to 
some serious tea drinking.

A young woman in a Preventers&#39; uniform jogged up to where they were 
sitting, and then saluted Releena. She gave her report as if it was a 
military debriefing. &quot;They&#39;ll be out of the meeting in another half 
hour,&quot; she repeated calmly, &quot;even if they have to shoot their way out. 
That&#39;s a direct quote from Lady Une, by the way.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Releena said with a sigh. The girl jogged off, and 
Releena turned to Dorothy with a shrug. &quot;Only half an hour left.&quot;

Dorothy looked at Releena thoughtfully, &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to ask you 
this: what in the world did you see in Heero Yui, anyway?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t pull any punches, do you?&quot; Releena said with a nervous 
little laugh. &quot;Well, part of it was a sort of mothering thing. He was 
so badly wounded, even back when I first met him. I guess I wanted to 
protect him, make him better.&quot; She sighed softly, &quot;And part of it 
was... well...&quot; She blushed, &quot;I&#39;m a bit ashamed to admit it.&quot;

Dorothy grinned as she quickly bargained, &quot;Tell you what. I&#39;ll tell 
you why I had a crush on you, all those years ago, if you&#39;ll tell me 
the rest.&quot;

Still blushing, Releena shyly admitted, &quot;I think it was also because 
he completely ignored me.&quot; She pretended to look very surprised, &quot;He&#39;s 
ignoring me?&quot;, then a bit indignant, &quot;How dare he ignore me?&quot;, then 
finally a exaggerated, seductive pose, &quot;I&#39;ll make him notice me!&quot; To 
the quiet sound of Dorothy&#39;s laughter she sheepishly explained &quot;I got 
so caught up in the thrill of the hunt I don&#39;t think I really noticed 
the faults of the prize.&quot;

Dorothy sipped a bit of tea before finally keeping her end of the 
bargain. &quot;When I first met you in the Sank Kingdom, you were dressing 
in that ridiculous school teacher outfit, surrounded by your students, 
and all I could think was, &#39;She&#39;s so beautiful.&#39; Of course, that was 
before I even talked to you,&quot; she explained with a smile.

&quot;I probably ruined that first impression as soon as I opened my 
mouth,&quot; a blushing Releena said with a nervous laugh.

Dorothy shook her head, &quot;No, once we started debating my crush got 
worse.&quot; She smiled up at Releena, &quot;There&#39;s so few people who can 
actually keep up with me, Releena. Thankfully Lady Une is one, 
Mariemea, one or two others, and you. I loved sparing with you, 
crossing swords with our minds over the merits of war versus peace.&quot;

Releena blushed softly, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;And you were such a babe,&quot; Dorothy said offhandedly, toasting her 
with her tea cup.

Releena hid her blushing face in her hands, laughing softly.

&quot;Free at last, free at last, thank god almighty we&#39;re free at last,&quot; 
they heard a pair of quite happy women&#39;s voices chanted together, 
growing closer by the second. Releena turned to see Noin and Une 
jogging down the hallway towards them.

Une gently pulled Dorothy out of her chair and into her arms, 
surprising the blonde with a vigorous kiss. &quot;You have no idea how good 
it is to see you,&quot; Une sighed.

&quot;Gee, I should trap you in budget meetings more often,&quot; a broadly 
smiling Dorothy said with a breathless little laugh.

Une winced, &quot;Don&#39;t even joke about that, please.&quot;

Noin laughed softly, helping Releena up from her seat as well, &quot;That 
goes double for me.&quot; She pulled Releena into a slower, more thorough 
kiss until the wolf whistles from nearby Preventer officers caused 
them to separate.

&quot;Don&#39;t you have something better to do?&quot; Une asked the revelers, 
sounding fairly severe but still smiling slightly. Once they were more 
alone she turned to the other three, &quot;Lets get out of here before the 
accountants decide they missed something.&quot;

Noin all but shuddered at the idea of dealing with the accountants any 
more today, &quot;Very good idea. Let&#39;s go!&quot;

Une slid a arm around Dorothy&#39;s shoulders as they walked out into the 
sunlight. Noin and Releena followed a bit more slowly, watching their 
friends walking together. &quot;They do make a lovely couple,&quot; Releena said 
softly.

Noin gently took Releena&#39;s hand, smiling down at her. &quot;Yes, they do. 
But not so lovely as you,&quot; Noin answered her softly.

&quot;You know just what to say,&quot; Releena smiled, squeezing Noin&#39;s hand 
slightly.

Noin smiled down at Releena, &quot;What say we go home, skip dinner, and go 
to bed early?&quot;

Releena grinned back at Noin, &quot;Promises, promises.&quot;

Une smiled, her arm around Dorothy as they all walked away from the 
Preventers&#39; building together. Treise&#39;s dream of a peaceful world 
still hadn&#39;t come about, but they were getting closer to it everyday. 
Absolute pacifism, she had realized, wasn&#39;t the answer. Only hard work 
from people with the courage to make the world a better place could 
accomplish that dream.

Une looked at her lover and her friends, and felt certain that it 
would be done, someday. </pre>
