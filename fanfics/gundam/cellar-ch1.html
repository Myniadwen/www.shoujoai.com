<h1>Cellar Door (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/draco.html">Draco</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Relena is panting softly on the bed. A very thin layer of sweat covers 
her face, quiet moaning noises are coming from the back of her throat. 

Geez, what a birthday present. 

&quot;I hope you enjoyed that,&quot; Relena raises her head slightly, &quot;Because I 
am never doing that again!&quot; 

&quot;Oh come on, you liked it! Admit it!&quot; I smile, trying my best to look 
innocent, &quot;I saw the look on your face when we won!&quot; 

&quot;Because of you and Duo,&quot; Relena rolls up from the bed, &quot;I definitely 
did not do anything to help us win!&quot; 

&quot;I was impressed by your volleyball skills! You were good! Besides, 
flashing Heero and Wufei helped. I swear they were on the verge of a 
nose bleed,&quot; I hand her my towel. 

Relena laughs, &quot;I did not flash them! You are the one who gave me the 
low cut shirt! Besides, I think Heero was off because Duo walked over 
and humped him while we were taking a break!&quot; 

&quot;For a moment there I thought they were going to do it on the court!&quot; 
I plant myself on the bed with her. 

&quot;I never knew they were that bad,&quot; Relena falls back on the bed. 

&quot;God, you have no idea. I saw a video of them on the internet doing... 
interesting stuff. I think they got hentai girl neighbors taping 
them,&quot; I tell her as I collapse besides her. She smells nice... like 
lilac. 

&quot;Tell me you are kidding,&quot; Relena rolls up, hovering over me. Her hair 
draping on my face. 

&quot;Nope,&quot; I try to keep my voice steady, &quot;But enough talk about them! We 
still have most of the day ahead. Remember you promised me the entire 
day!&quot; 

&quot;Of course,&quot; She smiles sweetly at me. God, I&#39;d go to war for that 
smile. It&#39;s a strange sort of torture and bliss to be in love with 
your best friend. 

&quot;Well, off to the showers, we are going to the fair this afternoon!&quot; I 
announce happily. 

&quot;I&#39;m going to be so tired tomorrow I think I&#39;m going to fall asleep 
during Tyr Marison&#39;s presentation,&quot; Relena jokes as she jumps off the 
bed and heads towards her bathroom. 

I attempt to follow her in. 

&quot;And no, Hilde, you can&#39;t join me!&quot; Relena smiles as she slams the 
door on me. Darn. 

I head back to my own room and turn on the water in the shower. I 
strip down naked and stare at myself in the mirror. 

Slightly too short, and barely visible breasts, but extremely toned. I 
smile slightly. Well, I know if Relena ever decides to throw herself 
at me it won&#39;t be for my body. I wonder what she looks like naked. I 
imagine her curves are softer, and rounder. And probably paler too. 

I bite my lips slightly as I step into the shower. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Relena is wearing my bracelet! I made it a long time ago when I was 
doing crafts with Zoey. We had extra beads so I made a bracelet for 
Relena while Zoey made one for her mother. The overly colorful plastic 
beads are entirely inappropriate for Relena&#39;s high class meetings, but 
she always wears it when we go out. God, I love her... 

She&#39;s also wearing the white low cut midriff shirt I gave her, and a 
pair of short jean shorts showing off her long silky legs. 

&quot;You look...&quot; heaven sent, beautiful, sexy... &quot;good.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks!&quot; There&#39;s that smile again. &quot;You look very sexy.&quot; 

She&#39;s joking. I know she&#39;s joking, but I can&#39;t help but feel just a 
tiny bit of hope. 

&quot;Ready to go?&quot; I ask as I toss her a helmet. 

She smiles as she jumps on the back of my bike. 

&quot;Hold on tight!&quot; I instruct her as I feel her arms cling on to my 
wrist. The engine roars as we zoom out of the parking lot. 

I know I ride way faster than I should, but I can&#39;t help it. I love 
the speed. There is just a great freedom that speed gives you, like 
nothing can stand you way, and limits cannot exist. 

I feel Relena gripping me tighter. She has never told me to slow down, 
never. She understands my need for the speed, and my addiction to it. 
And even though I know she worries all the time that I&#39;m going to 
crash, she trusts me with her life. God that makes me feel good about 
myself. 

We ride by a black glass building and for a moment I can see our 
reflection. Relena is holding on to me, her whole body leaning into 
me. Her long blonde hair floating behind her like a golden cape. We 
look almost surreal. Like two knights riding into battle. 

But for today, there is no battle, no politics, nothing... just the 
two of us. 

I can feel her breathing down my neck. Her warm breath sending shivers 
down my back. If I were a guy I&#39;d be having serious problem riding a 
bike right now. 

Too soon, we arrive at the fairgrounds and I feel her getting off the 
bike. I sit on my motorcycle for a moment, trying to remember the feel 
of her arms around me. Motorcycles are so useful. 

&quot;So what ride do you want to go on first?&quot; Relena asks as she eyes the 
large roller coaster. 

&quot;The roller coaster of course,&quot; I smile, confirming her worst fears. 

&quot;If I throw up, I&#39;m not talking to you for the rest of the day!&quot; 
Relena threatens. 

&quot;We jumped out of a plane together and you were fine!&quot; I recount our 
first adventure as I begin to drag her towards the entrance. 

She throws me a dirty look. 

As I push her past the crowd at the gates, I can see several guys 
eyeing her appreciatively. What can I say, I have good taste. 

The line for the roller coaster is especially long, but Relena agreed 
to wait anyway. I think she rather get the experience over with as 
soon as possible. 

There is a couple ahead of us making out... God, wherever I go, I am 
reminded of what others have! It&#39;s bad enough with Heero and Duo back 
at Preventers! Must every happy couple be showing off in front of me? 

Relena sees me cringe a little. She leans over slightly and whispers 
in my ear, &quot;Don&#39;t look back, I think the couple behind us is worse.&quot; 

Her words tickle my ears and I couldn&#39;t stop myself as I pulled her 
closer, my voice slightly lower than usual, &quot;What about us? Any chance 
of me getting lucky?&quot; 

She laughs as she slaps me away. 

I laugh back, but it hurts. God, it hurts so much sometimes when she 
doesn&#39;t realize it. I almost want to laugh at myself. How could she 
know that I love her? I hide it well enough by flirting with her. I 
almost try to make her think it&#39;s just a physical attraction... 
innocent flirting she can deal with, but what would she do if she 
finds out that I don&#39;t just have a crush on her, I love her? I am 
nothing like Heero, and the thought kills me... 

Relena is watching me. Her clear blue eyes studying me carefully, 
wondering why I am quiet. 

&quot;Just wondering what ride we should go on next,&quot; I lie. 

Relena says nothing. I can tell she knows I&#39;m lying, but she doesn&#39;t 
press me further. 

&quot;So what do people do while they wait in lines?&quot; Relena changes the 
topic. 

&quot;Make out, evidently,&quot; I watch some fancy tongue work between the 
couple behind us. 

It takes another twenty minutes before we get to the ride itself. 
Relena and I chats companionably about everything but our 
relationship. Safe topics I suppose. 

&quot;Hilde, why are the people all looking green after the ride?&quot; Relena 
demands as we step into the roller coaster cart. 

&quot;Must be the food here,&quot; I smirk as she sighs. 

The cart begins to move, and Relena grips my hand. 

Slowly the cart moves up its track. I feel the grip on my hand 
tighten. 

&quot;Try not to break my hand, okay,&quot; I tell her as the cart begins to 
drop. She replies by screaming. 

I like roller coasters. They remind me a little of MS units. Since 
peace, all MS units have been destroyed, and while I don&#39;t miss war, I 
do miss being able to pilot Mobile Suits. 

The ride is over in less than a minute, but Relena looks very happy 
for it to be over. 

&quot;I don&#39;t see the attraction of these things,&quot; Relena mutters as she 
gets off the cart. 

&quot;It&#39;s all about thrills,&quot; I hide my laughter as I lead her to the 
station where they capture the pictures of people during one of the 
drops. 

Our cart comes up, and the photo captures Relena&#39;s face with her mouth 
wide open. And me... the photo catches me watching her, the expression 
on my face painfully obvious. Fortunately, Relena is too mortified by 
her comical face to notice. 

&quot;You are not going to buy that thing, are you?&quot; Relena wonders as I 
approach the sales person. 

&quot;Of course I am,&quot; I keep my face neutral, &quot;I can blackmail you later 
with it.&quot; Not to mention it&#39;s a picture of us together, and I collect 
those like an obsession. 

&quot;I think I&#39;m ready for some tamer activities now,&quot; Relena&#39;s attention 
is quickly diverted by a person dressed as a cartoon bear, &quot;Look! 
Let&#39;s go take a picture with the bear!&quot; 

People dressed a cartoon characters freaks me out personally, but for 
some reason Relena finds them endearing. I suppose that after twelve- 
hour days with suit wearing politicians, people dressed as cartoon 
bears are a welcomed change. 

As I take a picture of Relena hugging the bear, I see her eyes follow 
a large plush tiger that some girl is carrying. 

&quot;Do you want one?&quot; I ask her as the cartoon bear waves goodbye. 

&quot;Want one what?&quot; She blinks. 

&quot;A large plushy tiger,&quot; I point to the girl in a distance. Her 
boyfriend beaming proudly having done his duty for the day. 

&quot;It&#39;s your birthday, Hilde,&quot; Relena pats my shoulder, &quot;I should be the 
one winning something for you!&quot; 

&quot;Well then, off we go to the games,&quot; I command, as we march forward. 

&quot;So what do you want?&quot; Relena scans the games area. 

I never had any stuffed animals. At the orphanage I always let Ani and 
Molly have them. 

&quot;Anything will do,&quot; I answer, but my eyes linger on a stuffed dolphin. 

I think she saw me looking at it, because that&#39;s first game Relena 
walks to. The rules of the game is simple, you had to throw a ring 
over a glass bottle in a sea of bottles. It was nearly impossible to 
win. 

Evidently Relena notices too because she buys fifty rings. 

&quot;I am not leaving until I win you the dolphin,&quot; Relena tells me 
firmly. 

The first ten rings miss completely. A large muscled man snorts 
slightly at Relena&#39;s efforts. 

I glare at him, but he doesn&#39;t even notice me. Instead, he roughly 
pulls his girlfriend for a kiss, and then proceeds to toss five rings 
himself. Much to my satisfaction, he misses as well. 

Meanwhile, Relena is on ring number thirty-four. 

&quot;This is hard,&quot; Relena smiles weakly, but she refuses to give up. Ring 
forty-two almost got a bottle, but it bounces off right before then. 

&quot;Give me another fifty rings,&quot; Relena waves money at the attendant. 

&quot;Girl, for that much money, you can buy the dolphin,&quot; the large muscle 
man tells Relena condescendingly. 

I can feel my face burn slightly as I move closer to the man. To my 
surprise, Relena somehow manages to grab a hold of my hand, and gently 
squeezes it. 

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t be the same,&quot; Relena smiles sweetly at the man before 
resuming her tossing. 

&quot;Some little rich girl just don&#39;t know what to do with their money!&quot; 
The man is asking for it, but I feel the pressure of Relena&#39;s hand 
holding me back. 

Relena does not even acknowledge hearing the man, as she concentrates 
on her ring tosses. 

Unfortunately, the man does not go away as I hoped, and he begins to 
make jabs at every throw Relena makes. 

A small crowd gathers around us, drawn by the huge pile of ring in 
front of Relena, and the loud voice of the man. All of their eyes are 
on Relena as she tosses the rings, missing one after another. 

&quot;Relena, you don&#39;t have to this,&quot; I whisper in her ears. She turns to 
me, her face dangerously close to mine, &quot;Yes, I do.&quot; 

I watch her go on tossing those darn rings, completely ignoring the 
crowd around us and the large man. 

One of the most important politicians on earth is embarrassing herself 
in front of a small crowd to win me a stuffed dolphin. I bite back my 
tears. I don&#39;t know why I should be so happy about something as stupid 
as this, but somehow I want to cry. and I haven&#39;t cried in a long 
time. 

Ring number seventy-two finally makes it, and the attendant hands the 
dolphin to Relena with a huge smile on his face. 

&quot;You don&#39;t give up very easily do you?&quot; The attendant asks Relena. 

&quot;Not when I&#39;m trying to get something I want,&quot; Relena answers as she 
looks directly at me as she hands me the dolphin. Her eyes light up. 
I&#39;m certain the stars are jealous. God, she&#39;s giving me hope... she&#39;s 
making me think there is a chance... 

I hug the dolphin tightly. I am never letting go. 

The rest of the day at the fair seems like a blur, as I cling on to my 
dolphin. I don&#39;t know what it is, but I suddenly feel vulnerable after 
all this time. I have long accepted my Platonic relationship with 
Relena, but today. today, I want more. Perhaps it&#39;s something I ate, 
it could be the look she gave me when she gave me the dolphin,or it 
might be because it&#39;s my birthday, and I have never been kissed, but 
today, I want my princess to kiss me. 

I don&#39;t know when I fell in love. It just sort of came up on me and 
hit me in the face. Not at all like how the poets and writers describe 
it, and right now it hurts like hell. It&#39;s somebody&#39;s idea of a sick 
joke that my princess is also my king. In all the Arthurian legends I 
have ever read, Lancelot never gets Arthur. And it&#39;s the same with us. 
On her side, it&#39;s rather Platonic, and on my side, I&#39;m burning with 
passion... well, maybe not that pathetic, but pretty close. 

&quot;We better get going. I made dinner reservations,&quot; Relena&#39;s voice 
breaks through my thoughts. 

I nod absent mindedly as we head towards the exit. 

&quot;You are quiet this afternoon,&quot; Relena comments casually, 
&quot;Contemplating how old you&#39;ve become?&quot; 

&quot;Relena, I...&quot; I love you. 

My would-be-confession is cut short as I see a car zooming through the 
parking lot, a small boy on its path. 

Damn it. I run forward and grab the little boy. 

I hear Relena screaming as the car hits me. 

Damn.
