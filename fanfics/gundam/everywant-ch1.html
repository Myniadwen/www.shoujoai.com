<h1>Everything She Wants Attained with the Shatter of Glass</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gundam/index.html">Gundam Wing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alithea.html">Alithea</a><br> </h2>
<pre>In all, the Sanq Kingdom was no more than glass. A crystal thing more 
fragile than many cared to realize and it was all in one little girl&#39;s 
hands. It seemed a strange thing that so many would flock to her side, 
send support, but they did and in droves. So there she was. Relena 
Peacecraft princess and sovereign holding so tight to her father&#39;s 
ideals, trying to desperately to live her life by them, to set an 
example for others to follow and she was clinging so tight no one 
seemed to notice the cracks slowly beginning to form in the 
foundation.

She was walking the gardens. Honey brown hair tied loosely with a 
black bow, stray strands catching the wind and ocean blue eyes lost in 
thought. From a distance she seemed to be contemplating a rose. 
Relena&#39;s eyes seemed desperately focused, but it wasn&#39;t the rose that 
she mulled over. It was her self. She wanted things, things that were 
dark and deadly. She felt a need for force and destruction. To give in 
and form an army. Conquer the world in one flail swoop and have the 
cowards of Romerfeller learn just how terrible the revenge of a little 
girl could be. It would be easy to gather the support she needed. Easy 
to lead because she seemed to shine in a way that made men want to 
follow her, boys fight and protect her. It was useless though she 
would never do anything so bold. And not because she was afraid, no. 
it was because she was doing her duty, yes, her duty to uphold a 
fallen king&#39;s beliefs, and beliefs that had once belonged to her 
father as well.

A sigh left her. She had taken a walk to try and forget about her duty 
for a bit. But she was soon lost in the pattern of a rose that so 
reminded her of another. The princess hardly knew what she was doing 
then. Taking a gun in her hand, anger hot and pressing her to take 
revenge on the person responsible for ending her happy life. If Une 
hadn&#39;t stolen away her father she would never have to worry about 
leading a country. She could go on being a foolish little girl who 
chased boys that sought to end her existence. She chuckled. It was an 
interesting little death wish she had set upon her self, but it was 
exciting. It led her away from the boring order of things, away from 
the flocks of fan girls and impotent young boys who didn&#39;t know what 
to do with her. If only Heero Yuy would fall from the sky and keep his 
promise everything would be grand. It was never going to happen 
though. Despite what others saw of him, Heero was too kind to ever 
fulfill his end of the bargain. In the end her favorite Gundam pilot 
had become just another knight in her court, just another protector to 
keep her from harm.

Relena stepped away from the rose and began the walk back to her 
office, ever aware of the student following her. She smiled slightly a 
pale and almost eager kind of grin. There was someone who would never 
fall back on a promise. Someone who questioned her at every turn and 
forced her to face the shadows she craved. Relena took a moment to 
pause by a tree. Eager for whatever awaited her. An argument most 
likely and the prospect made her giddy.

&quot;There you are Miss Relena&quot;, an overly enthusiastic voice chimed. &quot;I 
was wondering where you had run off to.&quot;

The princess hid her pleasure and faced the girl. &quot;Did you need 
something from me Miss Dorothy?&quot;

&quot;Nothing important&quot;, the pale blonde replied. &quot;I was just wondering if 
you&#39;d be up to one of our discussions?&quot;

&quot;I think I have time. Walk with me?&quot;

&quot;Delighted.&quot;

The discussion began with a seemly light topic but quickly wrapped 
into something heavier. Dorothy Catalonia didn&#39;t take prisoners in a 
debate. Her gray eyes catching every subtle movement and possible 
bluff the princess would offer. It was hard for Relena to keep up 
pace. It was hard to defend a belief she was just barely clinging to 
her self. Relena cringed slightly when Dorothy brought it up.

&quot;Wasn&#39;t it you&quot;, Dorothy began, &quot;who shot at Colonel Une?&quot; She slid a 
finger across her lips painting on an almost devilish grin. &quot;How is 
it. I wonder. that you can decry retaliation when only months ago you 
were out for blood?&quot;

The Peacecraft shook her head; &quot;At the time I was not Relena 
Peacecraft. I was Relena Darlain.&quot;

The goddess nearly scowled. &quot;That&#39;s an easy out. too easy I think. 
Something your brother is pulling momentarily. Changing your name 
doesn&#39;t change the things you have done, or the person you are Miss 
Peacecraft&quot;; Dorothy said putting heavy emphasis on the princess&#39; last 
name. &quot;All it does is change the kind of lies you&#39;ll use as an 
excuse.&quot;

Relena didn&#39;t have a response to that. So she fought for one that did 
little to help her, &quot;I&#39;m not a liar.&quot;

&quot;But you are a politician&quot;, Dorothy asked. &quot;Are you telling me you 
aren&#39;t like the rest of them? That you tell the truth no matter what? 
That you don&#39;t switch your political points of view to the best of 
your advantage?&quot;

&quot;Yes&quot;, she was getting a little more irritated with this conversation 
than she thought she would.

The pale blonde scoffed, &quot;Oh my Miss Relena that IS wonderful.&quot; She 
stepped a little closer backing Relena into a near by tree. &quot;I&#39;m half 
convinced you actually believe that&quot;, she purred. &quot;Almost convinced 
but really princess don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time to admit your greatest 
folly.&quot;

&quot;And what would that be&quot;, she bit.

With a sigh Dorothy stepped back an inch and brushed a stray lock of 
hair from her face. Gray eyes set and ready to attack, &quot;I could Miss 
Relena. I could almost believe you if it weren&#39;t for one little thing 
and that&#39;s Heero Yuy. You chase him like an alcoholic chases a bottle. 
You know you shouldn&#39;t. You know that he could conceivably end your 
life.but that&#39;s what you want deep down.&quot; She paused to lean in 
closer. &quot;You seek out destruction my wonderful princess. And those who 
seek destruction know nothing and believe nothing in the way of. 
peace.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t know anything&quot;, Relena tried to shrug away knowing how true 
Dorothy&#39;s words were and knowing she could never freely admit it, not 
when so many depended on her.

The goddess clicked her tongue and ebbed just a bit closer. 
Whispering, almost seductive in its low edge, &quot;If you like. I can show 
you how to get what you want.&quot;

&quot;My duty to this country exceeds my wants&quot; The princess replied 
sternly.

The blonde was still just a bit too close replying quickly, &quot;Your 
duty. is the impossible wish of a dead man.&quot;

It was a violent sting she never expected. So when it arrived it 
knocked her to the ground with a harsh bite. Dorothy lifted a graceful 
hand to her cheek that still throbbed from the force of the princess&#39; 
blow. It was too wonderful a victory. It spoke volumes against 
everything the slightly shocked young woman &#39;believed in&#39;.

Relena couldn&#39;t believe she did it. She leaned into the tree behind 
her for support watching the fire grow in Dorothy&#39;s eyes. The look was 
dark, hungry, dangerous and more importantly violent, as if some 
forgotten and vengeful god had been freed from captivity. She couldn&#39;t 
move as the goddess stood and stalked towards her. Frozen with 
emotions too rampant to describe. An elegant hand slid down the 
princess&#39; cheek and in a rush perfect lips set in to devour her.

It was a kiss unlike anything she had experienced. Relena lost to its 
violent pull immediately wrapping her arms around Dorothy&#39;s neck, 
tangling her fingers through the thick golden mane of the goddess&#39; 
hair and allowing.inviting a wicked tongue to brush past her lips and 
into her mouth. Her blue eyes shut at the victorious smile that washed 
through the kiss a tear streaking her face because it was what she 
wanted. It was what she craved.

She felt Dorothy begin to ease back for a breath, noting the 
intriguing wash of concern replacing the fire of the blonde&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Relena?&quot; the question put so lightly it seemed to speak in volumes.

And the princess refused to answer because it asked too much. She 
pulled taller girl closer begging to return the embrace that had 
nearly freed her. Nearly? She could never be completely freed as long 
as she felt the call and push of duty. And her duty to her father&#39;s 
memory suddenly took over, pushing away the ever-curious Dorothy 
Catalonia and running as fast as her legs would carry her to her 
office.

&quot;Well&quot;, Dorothy whispered, watching the princess flee. &quot;That.was most 
educational.&quot;

*****

Relena refused to have visitors for the next two days. Taking her 
meals alone. Diving into as much solitude as she possibly could, the 
battle that raged inside taking her over in waves of tears and brief 
moments of violence.

She stood reflectively over the broken shards of glass. It had been a 
snow globe reflecting in antique crystal a perfect world. Earlier she 
had thrown it against her office wall in a momentary fit of rage. 
There were too many people she couldn&#39;t protect, and she was making 
too many noticeable mistakes. Did she really want everything destroyed 
so badly she&#39;d risk others lives? Was that bit of darkness made just 
that much stronger by having lost her control and slapping Dorothy?

Dorothy...

The name induced a thick swell of lust. She kicked one of the broken 
glass pieces and sighed. Wants, needs, desires left untouched and 
uncovered, Relena wondered why she ever allowed the girl to enter her 
kingdom. She knew from the very start Dorothy Catalonia was sent to do 
nothing but cause harm, and she did but not the way Romerfeller 
intended. Surely not the way that was planned.

There was a light knock on the door and then it swung open. She noted 
the fleeting concern and quizzical expression set on girl&#39;s face.

A golden eyebrow perked as gray eyes focused on the shattered snow 
globe; &quot;Did it fall?&quot;

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t be wandering the palace this late at night&quot;, Relena 
wondered why she even bothered with a passive reply. &quot;You should 
return to your room.&quot;

&quot;You. You&#39;re really all torn up about it aren&#39;t you&quot;, Dorothy asked. 
She padded over to a broken piece and knelt down to pick it up. The 
shard sat in her hand and she held it out to the princess, &quot;They break 
so easily it&#39;s a wonder they last. How old was it? Ten years? Fifty?&quot;

&quot;Dorothy-&quot;

&quot;You know it&#39;s so silly&quot;, she threw the shard back with the other 
pieces. It shattered with a polite crash. Standing up she walked over 
to Relena&#39;s desk and sat on the corner. &quot;We need to talk&quot;, she stated 
firmly.

&quot;No we don&#39;t. Because it won&#39;t happen again.&quot;

The pale blonde sighed and leaned back resting her weight against her 
hands. She looked over at Relena with a playful, if not mocking smile. 
&quot;You know what happens to people who bottle up what they truly feel? 
They go insane.&quot; She paused adding, &quot;And then everything that could 
have been fixed gets pounded to dust.&quot;

&quot;Shut up.&quot;

A breath of relief, &quot;Thank God you&#39;re still battling it out, eh 
Relena?&quot; Dorothy was clearly getting more and more disappointed and 
made a familiar clicking sound with her tongue. &quot;I do wish you&#39;d stop 
pretending. I know you aren&#39;t this passive. I&#39;ve seen you handle a 
room full of pompous old men who think they know best. I&#39;ve seen you 
fight. So I know it&#39;s only a matter of time before you-&quot;

She had no other course but to laugh at the urgency, in which she was 
tackled, held firmly against the desk she had been sitting on. An 
eyebrow raised, &quot;Well you&#39;ve got me this far. now what?&quot;

&quot;I.&quot;

Dorothy felt Relena&#39;s grip loosen and she slowly sat up. Wrapping her 
arms around Relena&#39;s waist to keep her from escaping, enjoying the 
lack of resistance.

&quot;All that want and you haven&#39;t a clue what to do with it&quot;, she 
considered that statement for a minute and amended. &quot;Or. better still. 
you know what to do but you&#39;re still too terrified to do it.&quot;

The princess tensed at the comment and then she conceded, &quot;Dorothy. 
I.&quot;

&quot;What Relena?&quot; she purred softly deftly bringing her right hand around 
loosing the buttons of the princess&#39; shirt. &quot;What would you like?&quot; She 
tilted her head releasing her left arm from Relena&#39;s waist, using both 
hands to quickly pull open the neatly pressed blouse, stormy eyes 
catching the graceful way the buttons pooped off and scattered to the 
floor.

Relena just shut her eyes and let the goddess do her work. Only 
opening them again when Dorothy stopped.

&quot;Don&#39;t stop&quot;, the princess pleaded.

&quot;I don&#39;t play this way princess&quot;, was the quick reply. &quot;If you want 
someone to charge in and savagely take you while you just lie there 
like an obedient little girl I&#39;d suggest you fly off and find your 
precious Gundam pilot&quot;, she paused adding quickly, &quot;Or maybe seducing 
Miss Noin. She looks butch enough to handle your little passive wa-&quot;

Dorothy giggled mirthlessly when she felt the sting. &quot;So violent Miss 
Relena. That&#39;s twice you&#39;ve hit me.&quot;

&quot;Why do you have to say such things&quot;, the princess growled.

&quot;Because dearest it seems to be the only thing that gets you to admit 
what you feel&quot;, she paused rocking forward to stand, tracing a finger 
delicately down Relena&#39;s exposed chest stopping purposefully just 
before the white satin bra. &quot;And because. it makes things just that 
more interesting to me.&quot;

Dorothy noted the look growing in Relena&#39;s ocean blue eyes. Savored 
that bite of brief hatred as it was slowly devoured by a want that. 
she had to admit was burning with in her as well. But she waited. She 
couldn&#39;t just go on instinct and give. She had to know that something 
would be returned. Give and take was the essence of battle and she 
thrived on the sensation. Before she could offer up another cutting 
remark she found her self hurriedly pinned back down against the desk. 
Hungry lips soft and harsh all at once in how they took.

Lost in the fray Relena hardly noticed the swift veracity in which her 
clothing was being discarded. She was too busy battling her tongue 
against Dorothy&#39;s. Exploring the pale blonde&#39;s mouth and getting 
bolder as her hands fiercely pushed past the pearl buttons and silk 
fabric of girl&#39;s shirt. The softness of the goddess&#39; skin a stark 
contrast to the rough manner in which Relena touched it. She pulled 
out of the kiss as Dorothy began to tease her hands over Relena&#39;s 
newly exposed chest. The princess dipped her head to the nape of 
Dorothy&#39;s neck trailing harsh kisses and nipping at the pale skin with 
her teeth. Enjoying the quick and sharp gasps that escaped the girl&#39;s 
mouth as she moved lower leaving behind tiny marks until she was final 
nuzzled between Dorothy&#39;s pert and perfect breasts.

Anything previously occupying the space of the desk had been swiftly 
knocked to the floor when the goddess decided to fight for control and 
quickly had Relena on her back. The princess&#39; nails clawing down and 
through the fabric of Dorothy&#39;s blouse. Everything becoming a rush of 
heat, sweat, and want as both girls vied for domination. The pale 
blonde almost wanted the princess to win but could have none of it as 
she deftly tugged off Relena&#39;s trousers pleasantly surprised by the 
lack underwear. Breath ragged she set herself to her task. Kissing 
down and around the princess&#39; breasts always just barely brushing a 
nipple, left hand tickling across the plain of Relena&#39;s stomach and 
across her thigh.

&quot;Don&#39;t.D-don&#39;t tease&quot;, the Peacecraft pleaded gasping sharply as 
Dorothy&#39;s silky tongue ran across a nipple, sucking gently and then 
pulling away scraping her teeth against the sensitive flesh. Coherent 
thought leaving her as the goddess finally brought her hand between 
her legs, fingers messaging her clit with elegant care, gliding along 
easily with the princess&#39; growing want. Suddenly harsh and yet 
delicate as experimental fingers ebbed deep with in her. Breath ragged 
as she moved her hips in a slow rhythm dictated by Dorothy. The pulse 
increasing as she gasped louder, crying out as the world shattered to 
pieces in wave after wave of pleasure.

She fought for control of her senses as they begged her to rest and 
close her eyes. She couldn&#39;t though. The minute she could she pulled 
the goddess up to her lips kissing her with a ferocious passion the 
pale blonde was not expecting. The remains of Dorothy&#39;s tattered 
blouse were quickly dispelled and with a violent flip Relena resumed 
her role on top nearly sending both girls off the desk and to the 
floor. Thankfully they managed to keep their balance. With flawless 
ease Relena rid Dorothy of the ghastly pink school skirt and decidedly 
expensive silk underwear underneath. They were skin to skin. A sheen 
of sweat glistening across them. The princess quickly kissing her way 
between Dorothy&#39;s elegantly toned legs. Exhilarated by the feel of 
Dorothy&#39;s hands twining through her hair as she ran her tongue along 
the inside of a smooth thigh. Dorothy moaned victoriously as a mouth 
used to spout speech after speech of pacifist propaganda savagely took 
her, nipping, sucking, biting. Relena drinking in and tasting 
everything she wanted. She smiled upon hearing the intriguingly loving 
sounds spilling from Dorothy&#39;s mouth. The dubious sensation of her 
honey brown hair being pulled as she continued to lavish Dorothy over 
and over. Desires sated Relena inched back up to Dorothy who lay 
breathlessly waiting. The princess smiled and planted a gentle kiss on 
the goddess&#39; forehead.

&quot;Half the kingdom probably heard that&quot;, Dorothy sputtered.

&quot;Unlikely that anyone heard since this wing is off limits after 
sundown&quot;, was the quick reply followed in short by another easy and 
passive kiss.

Relena shut her eyes and nuzzled closer to the goddess.

&quot;We can&#39;t stay here you know&quot;, Dorothy stated.

&quot;We won&#39;t&quot;, was the whispered promise.

&quot;Good&quot;, she turned her head slightly catching a noise, small and 
minute as it was. The door was slightly ajar, stormy eyes catching the 
glimpse of violet just before they disappeared into the darkness. 
Dorothy smirked. This night had been more of a victory than she 
expected.
