<pre>Relena sighed in defeat, this man was IMPOSSIBLE! She took one last 
look at the &quot;perfect soldier&quot;(&#39;More like perfect jerk&#39; Relena 
thought), who was ofcourse aiming that classic gun at her forehead, 
before rolling her eyes and getting up to leave her OWN office.

***********************

It had started out well enough~Relena had called him into her office 
to ask him if he would be able to guard her at the United Nations 
meeting this evening, when Heero had slammed his fist on her desk. 
Relena looked at him with wide eyes, confused as to why he would 
damage her polished oak desk(which she had taken great pride in 
polishing this morning). 

&quot;This has got to stop,&quot; he deadpanned, and she raised an eyebrow.

&quot;Nani?&quot; she replied, folding her arms across her chest, leaning back 
in her chair and crossing her legs. He glared at her, and said, &quot;I 
don&#39;t want to be with you.&quot; 

She was taken aback, she was hurt, she was shocked, she 
was......extremely pissed and in need of a drink. Calmly thinking this 
out, she came up with a logical comeback-

&quot;Why the hell did you choose now?&quot;

&quot;Because it was obvious what YOU were planning, calling me in here...&quot;

&quot;EXCUSE ME! I was going to ask you if you would be able to guard me at 
the meeting tonight!&quot; she snapped, her face burning red with anger and 
embarrassment. Heero blinked, before taking a step back.

&quot;Oh.&quot;

Relena growled, leaned forward, and tapped her fingers on her desk 
impatiently.

&quot;And what else?&quot; she said expectantly. He sighed.

&quot;I want to be with....someone else....&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; she glared, leaning back into her chair again.

&quot;Duo.&quot;

Relena blinked, and suddenly wanted to kill someone. She was being 
dumped for some braided baka. Could this get any worse?

Shouldn&#39;t have said that. 

A gun was pointed at her head, and she rolled her eyes.

&quot;Omae o korosu~I don&#39;t want you ruining anything, &quot;he said in 
monotone, and the politician stood up from her desk. 

*************************

Back to the present. Relena stormed out of her office, and yelled to 
her secretary, &quot;CANCEL ALL MEETINGS!&quot; 

The secretary jumped, but nodded, looking at the blonde&#39;s retreating 
back confused. She merely shrugged it off, and picked up her phone to 
make the necessary calls. 

******************************

Relena fell onto her bed, flipping on the television in hope of 
something to take her mind off of the current situation. A war movie 
maybe. Or a horror movie would be nice, with a brown haired boy with 
Prussian eye&#39;s head exploding.

She saw the news flicker on, and decided to watch it for a few 
minutes. A commercial came on, with a man in a cheesy business suit, 
sitting on a sand dune next to a plastic palm tree.

I was watchin&#39; the news 
I was feelin&#39; the blues 
When this fella came on TV 
He said I&#39;m tellin&#39; you 
That science has proved 
That heartaches are healed by the sea 

Relena watched for a few minutes, considering the percentage of how 
true that was, could the sea help? 

&#39;True enough&#39; she thought, and jumped out of her bed, looking for a 
suitcase, while picking up her phone. 

&quot;Ms. Carnes,&quot; she said cooly,&quot;Cancel all appointments for a week, I&#39;m 
going on a vacation.&quot;

*************************

The next day, Relena was flagging down a taxi, suitcase in hand, and 
waved to Noin and Miliardo. 

&quot;Ja!&quot; she said cheerfully, and practically bounced into the taxi, 
heading towards the airport, deciding that going to the Florida Keys 
sounded like an excellent idea.

That got me goin&#39; 
Without even knowin&#39; 
I packed right up and flew down 

Relena sat at a barstool at the beach bar, clad in a sea blue bikini 
and jean shorts, wearing black flip flops, and a pair of bug-eye 
sunglasses. 

&quot;What&#39;ll it be miss?&quot; the bartender asked, cleaning off a mug. It was 
around six, and the sun was setting. Relena sighed.

&quot;Two pina coladas onegai,&quot; she ordered, smirking at the mans shocked 
expression.

&quot;T-two?&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

&#39;Time to abandon logic,&#39; she thought, and smiled at the bartender.

Now I&#39;m on a roll 
And I swear to my soul 
Tonight I&#39;m gonna paint this town. 

Around eight, Relena was ordering another two pina coladas, while 
humming to the Jimmy Buffet music, noticing a group of people 
gathering on the beach and dancing.

Joining in, a pina colada in each hand, she laughed as the group 
continued dancing to &quot;MargaritaVille&quot; and felt as if her she could 
just bury her problems in the beige, cool sand right now.

&#39;Gooooodbye Heero!&#39;

So bring me two pi&ntilde;a coladas 
I gotta have one for each hand 
Let&#39;s set sail with Captain Morgan 
And never leave dry land 
Troubles, I forgot &#39;em 
I buried them in the sand 
So bring me two pi&ntilde;a coladas 
He said goodbye to his good timin&#39; girl. 
Goodbye! 

Relena collapsed on the sand, sighing in contentment, and she watched 
the full moon appear and disappear behind the clouds. Troubles? What 
were those again? She smiled a true smile, and felt as if the 
heartache love brought her was washing away with those foamy cerulean 
waves.

Relena felt like she was at home, and let the waves tickle her feet, 
as she considered her options. She then noticed a familiar face lying 
not far away from her in the sand and decided to get reacquainted

Oh now I&#39;ve gotta say 
That the wind and the waves 
And the moon winkin&#39; down at me 
Eases my mind 
By leavin&#39; behind 
The heartaches that love often brings 
Now I&#39;ve got a smile 
That goes on for miles 
With no inclination to roam 
I&#39;ve gotta say 
That I think I&#39;ve gotta stay 
&#39;Cause this is feelin more and more like home 

************************

Next week, Relena strolled into Heero&#39;s room, smirking as Duo fell off 
the bed. Seeing Heero wasn&#39;t there, she politely bowed to him.

&quot;Domo arigato Duo-kun,&quot; she said, laughing inwardly at his shocked 
expression, &quot;for taking care of Heero for me.&quot;

&quot;Nani? Didn&#39;t you love....&quot;Duo stumbled, his eyes full of confusion. 
Her smirk grew and she kissed his cheek.

&quot;Nevermind,&quot;she whispered in his ear, and walked out.

Duo stared at the door she left by for a while, before shrugging.

&quot;Crazier every day....&quot;he muttered. 

***********************

Heero noticed Relena walking down the hall his way, and smirked 
inwardly.

&#39;She&#39;s gonna try and win me over again.&#39;

When the blonde passed right by him, he blinked.

********************

&quot;Ms. Carnes?&quot; Relena called her secretary on the speaker phone.

&quot;Hai miss?&quot;

&quot;Please send Ms. Shbecker in.&quot;

&quot;H-hai ma&#39;am.&quot;

The German girl waltzed in, a certain bounce to her step, and Relena 
giggled.

&quot;You rang?&quot;Hilde asked, putting her hands on her hips, leaning over 
Relena&#39;s desk.

&quot;Where have you been?&quot;

Hilde smirked, leaning in closer.

&quot;Putting on some new perfume.&quot;

&quot;Ah, what scent?&quot;

&quot;Pina colada ofcourse!&quot; Hilde replied. Relena giggled, beckoning Hilde 
to come closer. The german girl walked around the desk, sitting on the 
politician&#39;s lap. They had met in the Keys, Hilde being depressed that 
Duo had chosen Heero over her, and a relationship had quickly grown, 
as the two talked over drinks. Pressing the speaker button, Hilde 
politely ordered, &quot;Ms. Carnes?&quot;

&quot;Yes Ms. Shbecker?&quot;

&quot;Two pina coladas please.&quot;

&quot;Uh, o-okay miss.....&quot;

The secretary shook her head.

&quot;Getting drunk during work, what are they thinking....&quot;

****************

Relena and Hilde snuggled, and Duo stuck his tongue out.

&quot;Yuck!&quot; Duo exclaimed, looking at the tv in disgust. 

Heero glared at the tv, disapproving at what was going on between the 
two. 

&quot;And this was supposed to HELP you and Relena&#39;s relationship? You 
blotched it up BIG TIME Yuy....&quot;

Heero sighed, he thought if he and Relena broke up she would fawn over 
him some more, he would pretend he hated her again, and they would end 
up together, hopefully more in love than before. Mission Failed. Damn. 

&quot;So, this vacation she went on, where was it again? We need to go 
there too...&quot; Duo sighed, dragging Heero out with him. 

Bring me two pi&ntilde;a coladas 
He said goodbye to his good timin&#39; girl
