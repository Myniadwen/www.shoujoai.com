<pre>I walked into the club, the chill from outside instantly gone as the 
heat from the lights and dancing bodies warmed me. 

I scanned the room, making out faces in the flashing light. 

And there she was. 

The object of my affection, and more importantly, my lust. 

Hilde Schbeiker, swaying her slim hips to the thumping bass, clad in 
deliciously tight vinyl pants and a halter, showing off her well 
defined curves. 

I pushed my way through the crowd of people, all the while keeping my 
eyes on my treasure. I slowly slinked up behind her, wrapping my arms 
around her slim waist. She turned at my sudden touch. 

&quot;Sally&quot; 

I smiled and gently tugged her towards the back of the club. She 
smiled slyly and allowed me to lead her through the heavy crowed, 
until we reached a small room. I moved my free hand to the handle and 
found it unlocked. I turned and smiled to her again and led her in. 
The room turn out to be a poker room, with a circular table in the 
middle, and smelled of smoke and faintly of sex. I turned around and 
closed the door, making sure to lock it. 

I turned and looked at her. She had propped herself up on the poker 
table, smiling seductivly at me. I smiled and walked over, taking my 
sweet time. As soon as I was in reach, she pulled me close and kissed 
me hard. I responded eagerly, parting her lips with my tongue and 
shoving it inside. She made a small sound of delight and let her 
tongue play with my own, rolling and moving over each other. 

I broke the kiss and she whimped. I pushed her gently on to the table, 
climbing on top of her and kissing her again, letting my hands find 
the strings on her halter, and undoing them, flinging the item across 
the room. 

I began to kiss her cheek, than her neck, then began licking my way 
down her soft skin. I reached her soft, plump breasts, and gently 
licked a nipple, watching it harden instantly. I smiled and nibbled on 
it, rolling my tounge around it, as one of my hands teased the other. 
Her back arched into my touch and she let out a low moan. I continued 
nibbling, suckling, and fondling her breasts, I let my hand lightly 
trail down her stomach and undid her pants, slowly unzipping them. 

I felt her hands run through my hair, and then down my back, pulling 
my shirt up. I stopped just long enough for her to pull the shirt over 
my head, then continued to tease at her nipples. I stopped my 
movements, and a dissappointed whimper left her lips. She moved under 
me and began to under my bra, thowing it out of the way. She pinched 
my nipples and smiled when I moaned loudly. I let her continue to 
tease me, and gave a loud moan when she took a hardened nipple into 
her mouth. She suckled hard on it, gently nibbling every once in a 
while. Her hand left my other nipple and both hands found their way to 
the edge of my pants. She gently undid the button, and unzipped them. 
She stopped her sucking and I positioned myself to be de-pantsed. She 
roughly pulled them off and threw them out of the way. 

I smiled lustfully and hooked my fingers on the waistband of her 
panties and pulled them off. I lowered my head and kissed the inside 
of her thigh, making my way to her puckered opening. I reached it, 
kissing it lightly, then gently snaking my tounge out. I found her wet 
and warm, and she tasted musky and slightly bitter, and I was almost 
hooked instantly. I lashed my tounge out, wanting her taste forever. 
She started to buck into me,and moaned loudly. I stopped, knowing she 
was going to cum soon. She gave a whine, and I grinned. 

I pulled myself up over her, holding her in one arm. She looked at me 
slightly bewildered, then grinned when she felt my hand moving up her 
leg. I opened her lips and rubbed my thumb lightly over her clit. She 
closed her eyes and moan, thrusting her hips up into my movement. I 
pulled away, and she glared at me, biting me slightly on the shoulder 
as a sort of punishment. I giggled slightly, and kissed her hard on 
the lips, moving my hand back to her opening. Unlike my rough kisses, 
I gently pushed my index finger into her. She moaned, biting down on 
my lip. I gave her a few moments to adjust, and then slowly moved my 
finger in and out of her. She bucked her hips against my finger, 
wanting more, and who was I to deny her of it? I pushed in another 
finger, and then another. She began moaning my name, breaking off our 
kiss. 

I moved my fingers inside of her faster, loving the sound of her 
moaning my name. I could feel myself on the verge of my own orgasm 
when she slipped her own fingers into me, reciprocating the action. I 
moaned and threw back my head as her fingers moved in and out me. I 
looked down at her as she arched her back and threw back her head as 
she reached her climax. 

&quot;Sally! Oh god!&quot; 

Hearing her scream out my name with the sensations of her fingers 
caused me to fall into a white hot climax. 

&quot;Hilde!&quot; 

I screamed her name, loving the feeling that only lasted a few 
seconds. 

As we both came down from our climax, I slowly pulled my fingers out 
of her, both of us panting against the other, our sweat mixed 
together. I watched as she pulled on her clothing, maneuvering in the 
tiny room.

&quot;Walk me home?&quot; 

&quot;Only if I can stay the night&quot; 

&quot;Of course&quot;
