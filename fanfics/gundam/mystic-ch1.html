<pre>Tsuki no mukou aoi SEARCH LIGHT kasanaru 
Beyond the moon, a blue searchlight, one after another 

A dark blue-haired woman dressed in white tube top and pedal pants ran 
through bushes and trees. She is chasing a woman whose beauty is that 
of a goddess. A woman that had caught her eye while walking through 
the forest in this autumn night. The woman smiled at her and when she 
tried to come closer to her, the other woman ran. Captivated with this 
dream, she gave in and ran after the woman. She could feel her heart 
pound as she ran like the wind. Her eyes darting the faint image of 
the woman trying to flee her vision. 

&#147;Who are you&#133;&#148; she whispered to the winds. 

She ran after the goddess in flight and came to halt as heaved heavy 
breaths. Lifting her head, she took in the view in front of her in 
awe. 

Standing in front of her was the goddess&#133; dressed in almost 
transparent garb. She was wearing a tube top one-piece lavander dress 
that hung just above her knees. Her brown, curly hair that gave accent 
to her face&#146;s creamy skin, ended along her shoulders, shimmering as 
the moonbeams danced over it like water. The lass&#146; eyes had captured 
the stars twinkled in those light purple orbs. She wore a pair of star 
earrings, making her all the more radiant. 

Totsuzen maiorita ANGEL, sou kimi wa dare? 
Suddenly alighted an angel, so, who are you? 

The girl with the short dark hair was speechless, even more shocked to 
see such beautiful eyes which she had never seen in her whole life. 
Surely, she had sparkly eyes as well but not like this woman&#146;s eyes 
that shined like the stars. 

She held her breath when the goddess&#146; lips opened to speak. 

&#147;It&#146;s a lovely night.&#148; 

&#147;Yes it is.&#148; &#145;Oh great, is that all I could say?&#146; The short-haired 
girl scolded herself. The other girl smiled and continued to ask her 
more questions. 

&#147;What is your name?&#148; 

&#147;My name is Hilde. What&#146;s yours?&#148; 

The brown-haired girl giggled and broke into a run and left Hilde 
confused for full five seconds before running after the girl. 

&#147;Stop! Wait! You haven&#146;t told me your name yet!&#148; Hilde shouted at the 
other girl. 

The other girl just looked at her while running and smiled. The path 
they were running through was foggy and yet Hilde willed her eyes not 
to let go of the sight of the captivating woman. And so she ran faster 
as her legs would carry her. She leaped over fallen logs and on 
boulders&#133; she would not let go of this mysterious lady that easily. 

Ima unmei no tobira ga hiraku SO JUST FALL IN LOVE 
Now fate&#39;s door is open So just fall in love 

&#145;I&#146;m gonna catch you whether you like it or not!&#146; Hilde swore to 
herself as she ran faster. The other woman probably heard her ragged 
breaths as she neared her. Her wavy hair flipped as she turned her 
head around to face Hilde while running. She smiled as she squealed 
and ran faster. 

It was getting darker and darker and mist was covering the woods. The 
moonbeams were of little help to any night eye. Before Hilde realized 
what she did next, she was clutching a lady who nearly fell off into a 
puddle of mud and they were now standing on a big boulder, breathing 
hard. 

Munasawagi suru kono shunkan wo nogasanai DON&#39;T STOP, BABY 
Feeling apprehensive, don&#39;t let go of this moment, Don&#39;t stop, baby 

Hilde blinked and gasped. The girl in her arms was breathing calmly, 
head bowed. Blinking, she lifted the girl&#146;s head. The girl with the 
wavy hair looked at her with those stunning eyes. The girl smiled. 

&#147;Now that you&#146;ve caught me, what do you want to do to me?&#148; 

The girl was breathing meekly and her breath tickled Hilde&#146;s face. 
Hilde smiled. 

&#147;I want to know your name.&#148; 

The girl giggled and bit her lip, looking at Hilde straight in the 
eye. Twirling around, she broke free of the embrace she was currently 
entrapped into and tugged on Hilde&#146;s hand. 

&#147;Follow me.&#148; 

Yake sou na kimi no MYSTIC EYES 
It&#39;s like they&#39;re burning, your Mystic eyes 

&#145;When is dream going to stop? I never knew dreams can be so tiring&#133;&#146; 
Thoughts were blowing swiftly past Hilde&#146;s mind as she ran with the 
mysterious girl. Only the curly-haired girl&#146;s giggles and the rustling 
of dry leaves can be heard through the dark clearing. Hilde smiled. 
Sure she haven&#146;t found out the girl&#146;s name yet, but the feeling of her 
hand in hers will be marked there forever. 

Just before she could ask the girl to stop running, the girl stopped 
dead in her tracks and twirled about, looking at Hilde directly in the 
eyes and smiled. 

&#145;She&#146;s so beautiful.&#146; 

Mujakina egao de BREAKING DOWN 
From your innocent smile, Breaking down 

After a few catched breaths, Hilde smiled at the girl and tightened 
her hold on the girl&#146;s hand. The curly-haired girl giggled. Not caring 
anymore, Hilde touched one cheek and caressed the girl&#146;s soft skin. 

&#147;You&#146;re so beautiful. I want to know your name.&#148; 

&#147;Why does my lady want to know my name?&#148; The girl chirped. 

&#147;Because,&#148; Hilde started forward, their face dangerously close. &#147;I 
want to know the name of the girl I wish to kiss.&#148; 

The girl blushed and winked at her, biting her lower lip. 

&#147;I am called Cathrine.&#148; The girl said her eyes sparkling. Hilde 
smiled. 

&#147;Pleased to meet you, Cathrine.&#148; Hilde said as she lifted the girl&#146;s 
hand and kissed it. 

Kimi dake ni hitomi no oku no aizu 
From only you, a sign deep within your eyes, 

The girl named Cathrine smiled and Hilde was enthralled with her 
beauty. Hilde searched for a sign in her eyes, she looked for warmth 
in those depths. Oh how she wanted this lady&#133; 

&#145;I want her&#133;.&#146; Hilde screamed thoughts only her eyes would be able to 
voice out. Cautiously, she advanced, not caring anymore. She wrapped 
her arms around the other girl&#146;s waist and back. Their foreheads 
touching, gazes locked and lips so deliciously close&#133; 

Slowly but sweetly, they kissed. 

Hatenai tabi wa hajimaru mou tomaranai mune no kodou 
An endless journey begins, don&#39;t ever stop the heart beat 

It was a soft touch at first then a flurry of soft brushes. Nipping at 
both lips, the kiss grew urgent and sweeter. Both women locked in each 
other&#146;s embrace feeling the need and desire to in each other&#146;s arms 
enjoyed the reveling sensation of the kiss. They stopped kissing and 
looked into each other&#146;s eyes, feeling each other&#146;s ragged breaths and 
heartbeats. 

Both women smiled. Smiles that could put the sun to shame in this cold 
night. 

&#145;I finally found you&#133;&#146; 

Kimi wo saratte ikitai 
I want to carry you away 

&#145;and I&#146;m never letting go.&#146;
