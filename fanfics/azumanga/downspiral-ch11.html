<a href="../azumanga/downspiral-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Well guys, I hope you liked how I used a cliff hanger to end the last 
chapter. The only reason I did what I did with the description of what 
happened over the months is because if I were writing day by day 
accounts, we&#39;d be here for fifty or so chapters full of nothing but the 
same thing. Sometimes in a story, you gotta skip ahead with a brief 
account. I&#39;m not getting lazy, I&#39;m just keeping to the point of the 
story. The point of this story is not what happens to Tomo and Yomi at 
school. What is? Just gotta read the last few chapters to find that 
out.;-)

The Broken

Saturday, March 22nd, 12:12 PM, Takino residence.

&quot;I look like shit...&quot; Yomi was staring into the bathroom mirror, and if 
one were standing there with her, one would have a hard time 
disagreeing. All the drugs had caught up to her. She weighed One-Thirty 
on the Scale, her skin was tightening in some places and wrinkling in 
others. She had slash marks all over her left wrist, and needle marks on 
her right biceps and triceps, complimented by a few cigarette burns on 
her right forearm. She hardly ever wore her glasses anymore. &quot;Ugh...my 
head.&quot; Yomi had just awoken, and already, she had a headache from the 
sex the night before. It was another change. Tomo had slowly gone from 
tender in the bed, to hard as a rock. It was brutal, but at this point, 
it was sad, but Yomi was powerless to stop Tomo from doing anything 
anymore.

There were even times when she would sit up at night, wandering if she 
really loved Tomo. When she was able to convince herself that she did, 
and unanswerable question always came next.

&quot;How did it come to this?&quot; Again, Yomi wandered aloud. She just let out 
a large, heavy sigh, before she began to slip her clothes on. A pair of 
flannel pajama bottoms that, months earlier, would have never fit her, 
and an Extra-Large Tee-shirt. It embarrassed Yomi, the girl who always 
watched her weight, to no end that she looked like this now. But she 
knew she couldn&#39;t stop it. The worst part is, it wasn&#39;t the fault of 
Tomo. No, Yomi had stopped blaming her girlfriend a long time ago. She 
knew now that she was to blame, and so was everything that she&#39;d ever 
done without Tomo knowing.

&quot;I fucked up pretty badly.&quot; Yomi ran some cold water in the sink, 
brushing her teeth and splashing herself in the face with the cold 
water, in an attempt to wake herself up better.

The smell of smoke and food was coming up from downstairs. Yomi sighed 
again, and exited the bathroom, walking down the stairs, where Tomo sat, 
with breakfast made.

&quot;Morning...&quot; Tomo let out a large hacking cough. &quot;Yomi...&quot; She say 
there, smoking a flavored cigar. Yomi had long ago stopped caring where 
Tomo got her tobacco and drugs. She merely nodded as she sat down beside 
her lover. It used to be a good morning kiss. Which slowly turned to a 
hug, then to a peck, then a nod. Yomi missed the good days. She looked 
upon the food that Tomo had sat out. Burnt toast, Rice balls with either 
too much or not enough rice stuck in, and various other half ass foods. 
No drinks either. They were out, and didn&#39;t have the money for more milk 
or orange juice. Yomi looked up at Tomo, trying to look pissed. For a 
moment, the latter didn&#39;t even notice, until she took a drag from her 
cigar and saw the staring. &quot;What can I do ya for, sweets?&quot;

&quot;How many times have I told you not to smoke or snort while you&#39;re 
cooking BREAKFAST!&quot; Yomi motioned at the Cigar, and at ths white powdery 
remains on the counter behind her. Tomo just shrugged, taking another 
drag.

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; Tomo was completely unfazed by her steady&#39;s 
outburst, and it irritated Yomi to no end.

&quot;QUIT TELLING ME IT&#39;LL ALL BE OKAY!&quot; She yelled, which got Tomo to pay 
attention, but only for a moment. She just continued to smoke and look 
away. &quot;Eat some of this shit you made and tell me if you think it&#39;s 
okay?&quot;

&quot;Fine, I will!&quot; Tomo snapped back, grabbing a piece of toast and 
stuffing it into her mouth. At first, she chewed without problem, but 
the look on Tomo&#39;s face let Yomi know that she&#39;d probably vomit that up. 
Still, pompous as she now was, Tomo swallowed it whole, gagged, and took 
another drag of her cigar, finally tossing the bud into a trash-can 
behind her. &quot;See? A-Okay.&quot; The pissed look never left Yomi&#39;s face, and 
it was getting under Tomo&#39;s skin. &quot;What? Why are you being so bitchy 
lately! You were never like this before!&quot;

&quot;You were never like this either!&quot; Yomi had a point. If Yomi was ugly, 
then Tomo was hideous. Weighing in at One Sixty-Five, she was wrinkly 
skinned all over, yellow teeth, had nosebleeds on a regular basis, more 
headaches than two bottles of Tylenol could fix in a week, and a 
cracking voice, Tomo looked like she was about Thirty Years old, when 
she was only Sixteen. Tomo couldn&#39;t argue.

&quot;You&#39;re no sex devil either!&quot; Tomo retorted.

&quot;You seem to think that&#39;s all I am!&quot; Yomi shot back.

&quot;Bullshit, I love you, Yomi!&quot;

&quot;I want to believe that!&quot;

There was a long silence, and Tomo, even though drugs and lifestyle had 
changed her, tried to use her seductive, loving voice. She walked up to 
Yomi, coughing a few more times before she got there, and wrapped her 
arms around her neck.

&quot;Then believe it, Yomi. I love you. You ARE my Perfect Drug.&quot; That did 
it.

At that moment, something inside of Koyomi Mizuhara snapped. Everything 
had finally caught up to her. A few tears welled up in her eyes. 
&quot;What&#39;s-&quot; Tomo was quickly cut off by Yomi, her voice cracking, and 
tears running down the side of her face.

&quot;I can&#39;t take it anymore!&quot; She pushed Tomo off, who barely caught 
herself before hitting her back on the table, and ran, yelling as she 
left. &quot;If all I am to you is a drug...I Can&#39;t take it anymore Tomo! I&#39;m 
sorry! It&#39;s all my fault!&quot; Those were the last words heard before Yomi, 
her heart pounding from weakness, and her breath heavy, sprinted out the 
front door of the house, and out of Tomo&#39;s life.

Tomo only sighed at first, but then her tears began to roll too. Tomo&#39;s 
sub conscious began to go wild.

&#39;She&#39;s right, Tomo.&#39; Tomo thought to herself. &#39;You&#39;re all washed up. 
Drugs have taken you over. You&#39;ve fucked up. You had it all.&#39; Each 
statement, a different voice. Tomo placed her hands over her temples 
forcefully, and began to weep.

&quot;Stop! STOP! Get out of my head!&quot; The voices continued.

&#39;You could have had it all. But now all you have is an empire of dirt.&#39; 
Tomo lost it, and began to speak aloud to her thoughts.

&quot;But what can I do? I want to take it all back.&quot; She was still crying.

&#39;You can&#39;t get a second chance.&#39;

&quot;But I want one!&quot;

&#39;You can only do one thing now.&#39;

&quot;What? What can I do? Tell me?&quot;

&#39;Only you can figure that out.&#39; The voices turned into maniacal 
laughter, and Tomo fell to her knees. After what seemed like forever, 
she had an idea, and heard the voices one last time. &#39;Atta Girl, &#39;Atta 
girl. Don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ll see here there.&#39; With the tears still rolling, 
Tomo nodded. She knew exactly what to do.

Standing up, she reached into her bag, which sat beside her chair at the 
kitchen table, and opened it up to check the contents. Ten Ziplock bags 
of Cocaine, which she&#39;d acquired in exchange for being the target of a 
gang-bang with a family of men bigger than the Brady Bunch. Making sure 
she had all the materials she needed, She nodded and carried the bag 
upstairs to her room. After rummaging around in the closet where her dad 
kept his survival gear, she found exactly what she was looking for. 
Smiling, she rolled it out on the floor, took her Cocaine and materials 
out of her bag, and crawled in.

The last sound of the outside world that Tomo would ever hear would be 
the sound of herself zipping the sleeping bag shut.</pre>
