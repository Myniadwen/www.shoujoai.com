<pre>Shan Pu listened calmly to the teacher&#39;s excited introduction, wondering 
just what was going on with the older woman. &quot;This year,&quot; Miss Yukari 
said cheerfully, &quot;I&#39;ve managed to acquire a special transfer student for 
our class! She comes all the way from China.&quot;
 
&quot;From China!&quot; Tomo repeated the words eagerly, gazing at the busty, 
purple haired woman standing by their teacher in awe.
 
&quot;I&#39;d like you to meet,&quot; Yukari double checked the spelling, &quot;Shan Pu!&quot;
 
&quot;Shampoo?&quot; Yomi blinked, her glasses shining as the taller girl looked 
on curiously.
 
&quot;Yes,&quot; Shan Pu nodded agreeably, bowing. &quot;Shan Pu hopes class will 
support her.&quot;
 
&quot;I think that&#39;s two words,&quot; Chiyo-chan pointed out politely to the 
others. &quot;Shan,&quot; she paused intentionally, &quot;Pu.&quot;
 
&quot;Aw,&quot; Kagura waved it off as the athletic young woman grinned, &quot;Shampoo 
will make a good nickname for her.&quot;
 
&quot;But if it sounds just like her real name,&quot; Osaka offered up 
thoughtfully, &quot;can it really be called a nickname?&quot;
 
&quot;Take any seat you like,&quot; Yukari waved towards the empty chairs, 
casually tuning out her students usual conversations.
 
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Shan Pu nodded respectfully, her eyes sweeping the room 
warily. Her gaze landed on a black haired woman sitting in the corner by 
the window and she felt a sudden surge of powerful fighting energy. 
&#39;Maybe this detour will be worthwhile after all.&#39; she thought, striding 
to a empty seat nearby the other woman.
 
&quot;She gets to sit by Sakaki?&quot; Kaorin sighed, the black haired girl 
tossing adoring glances at Sakaki, &quot;I envy her.&quot;
 
&quot;Who you?&quot; Shan Pu asked softly as she sat down, looking at the dark 
haired girl beside her thoughtfully. Her physical presence was striking, 
almost like electricity danced around her, and she had a striking beauty 
to her, too.
 
&quot;Sakaki,&quot; she answered Shan Pu calmly, opening up her books and watching 
their teacher without saying another word.
 
&#39;Secretive,&#39; Shan Pu noted, &#39;interesting.&#39;
 
Her quest for vengeance against the hated red headed girl had taken Shan 
Pu to the island of Japan, but she didn&#39;t know exactly where to go next. 
As her Grandmother and the elders of the Amazon tribe worked to find the 
evil Saotome bitch she had been placed in this school, in the hopes of 
preparing her better for Japanese society. Watching Osaka completely 
fail in answering the question Miss Yukari asked she somehow doubted it 
was going to work.
 
&quot;Welcome to our school,&quot; Yomi offered her hand politely, her long mane 
of brown hair flowing down her back.
 
Instead of shaking Shan Pu bowed, her expression politely respectful. &quot;I 
was wondering,&quot; she looked towards Chiyo, &quot;what is that child doing 
here?&quot;
 
&quot;She jumped ahead several grades,&quot; Yomi calmly explained, &quot;Chiyo-chan is 
probably smarter than most of us.&quot;
 
&quot;Ah, hidden gifts,&quot; Shan Pu nodded gravely.
 
Yomi sweatdropped, &quot;Well, something like that.&quot;
 
Nearby where they sat Sakaki ate from her bento, the box decorated with 
frolicking kittens as Kagura chatted away to her. Sakaki was paying 
attention to the conversation but the majority of her focus seemed more 
to be on the magazine sitting beside her, depicting cats in the wild as 
well on the streets of the city.
 
&#39;She likes cats,&#39; Shan Pu noted, &#39;isn&#39;t that interesting?&#39;
 
As classes ended Shan Pu slipped away, finding a secluded spot beside a 
pond of crisp, cold water. Stripping her school uniform off she braced 
herself then splashed herself with water. In an instant the change came 
and a purple furred cat stood in Shan Pu&#39;s place. Retracing her steps 
she found where she had last seen Sakaki, the unique scent tickling her 
nose.
 
&#39;Strange,&#39; Shan Pu thought as she followed the scent, &#39;I haven&#39;t 
encountered a human that smelled like this before.&#39; She swiftly traced 
it through the crowds, then off in the distance she heard a sullen 
growl. Urgently Shan Pu raced on, coming around a corner to see Sakaki 
struggling with a cat biting her hand.
 
Sakaki bit back her pain, trying to get the cat&#39;s teeth free from her 
finger. Looking up she was startled to see the purple cat gazing at her 
intently, then it raced forward. With a lunge it struck the gray cat, 
forcing it free from Sakaki&#39;s hand, then took up a guarding position in 
front of Sakaki, hissing furiously. The gray cat cringed, then bolted in 
fear.
 
Shan Pu slowly let her growl fade away, glaring after the other cat. 
Somehow Sakaki smelled like family, like the wild cats that she was 
cursed to become, and the instinct to defend her overrode all conscious 
thought. That scent suddenly enveloped her as Sakaki held her close and 
Shan Pu felt a purr begin deep in her chest.
 
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sakaki said, her voice touched with a bit of wonder at 
meeting a cat that didn&#39;t hate her. Carefully she began to scratch 
behind the cat&#39;s pointed ears and was rewarded with a even more throaty 
purr.
 
Shan Pu almost wallowed in Sakaki&#39;s arms, purring happily at the girl&#39;s 
touch. She knew that she should be spying on the girl, trying to find 
out the source of the girl&#39;s hidden power, but she couldn&#39;t seem to help 
herself. She felt Sakaki get up, still holding her in a careful grip and 
Shan Pu just cuddled close.
 
&quot;My parents are going to be gone a few weeks,&quot; Sakaki murmured after a 
moment, &quot;would you mind if I took you home with me?&quot;
 
For a moment Shan Pu wondered if Sakaki suspected the intelligence 
hidden by her cursed state, but finally decided that the girl was just 
being kind. &quot;Meow,&quot; she answered cheerfully.
 
&quot;Good,&quot; Sakaki nodded as they headed out. The tall girl talked about the 
neighborhood as they walked, her voice happy as she talked about the 
people and animals that lived there. Eventually they reached a smaller 
house and she pushed open the gate then opened up the door with her key.
 
Shan Pu swept the place warily with her eyes, but no foes presented 
themselves. Instead it was quiet and neat, and surprisingly there were 
no lingering scents of pets in the air. &#39;Is there some reason Sakaki 
can&#39;t have pets?&#39; she wondered.
 
Sakaki looked at the cat thoughtfully a moment. &quot;I should make sure that 
there&#39;s not too much cat fuzz around to bother my mom&#39;s allergies,&quot; she 
said a bit regretfully.
 
Shan Pu purred sleepily, the day&#39;s excitement overwhelming her a bit. 
She barely registered their going through the house or the water 
starting, in fact she only realized she was in trouble when Sakaki was 
readying to put her in the hot bath. &#39;Oh no,&quot; Shan Pu thought, and 
attempted to wiggle free from her firm grip. She managed to get free 
from the startled girl, but then dropped right into the water.
 
Splash! Poof!
 
Sakaki gazed in shock as the cat was replaced by a familiar young woman, 
her long purple hair soaked as she sat in the sudsy water. Rather 
sheepishly she brushed sudsy water from her face, covering her full bust 
reflexedly. &quot;Here,&quot; Sakaki gallantly offered to help her out of the tub, 
holding out a towel in the other hand.
 
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Shan Pu answered, smiling wryly as she was pulled out then 
dried herself off vigorously.
 
&quot;How did...?&quot; Sakaki asked.
 
&quot;Is long story,&quot; Shan Pu admitted. A few moments later and they were 
sitting in Sakaki&#39;s cat-decorated room where she had explained the curse 
and sketched in details of her quest. A bit more sheepishly she 
explained why she had come after Sakaki only to get a blank look in 
return.
 
&quot;I&#39;m not a martial artist,&quot; Sakaki shook her head firmly, &quot;I don&#39;t even 
know how to fight.&quot;
 
&#39;She has that much of a battle aura and she&#39;s untrained?&#39; Shan Pu 
thought in surprise. The idea of what she might be capable of if Sakaki 
was actually trained was mind boggling. She noticed a faintly sad look 
on Sakaki&#39;s face and Shan Pu asked, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;
 
&quot;I like cats but they don&#39;t like me,&quot; Sakaki explained a bit sadly, &quot;I 
should have known there was something odd going on when I met one that 
liked me.&quot;
 
Shan Pu met those sad eyes and felt a moment of deep compassion towards 
her. &quot;Do you have some cold water?&quot; she asked curiously.
 
&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Sakaki picked up a glass from the bedside table and handed 
it to her.
 
Carefully Shan Pu splashed herself once more, and the towel dropped away 
as she shifted back to cat form. She bounded towards Sakaki and let her 
pick her up, purring again as she rubbed her furry cheek against 
Sakaki&#39;s hand.
 
&#39;I may not be here long,&#39; Shan Pu mused as Sakaki scratched behind her 
ears worshipingly, &#39;but I&#39;m going to be comfortable while I&#39;m here.&#39;
 
End
 
Notes: I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t get Shan Pu quite right, but I&#39;ll try to 
fix it when I do my second draft. I&#39;m assuming the spring of drowned cat 
was created by a wild feline rather than a domestic cat, but other than 
that I&#39;m working with the regular Ranma 1/2 world.</pre>
