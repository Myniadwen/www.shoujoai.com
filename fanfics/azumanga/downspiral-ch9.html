By their standards, the rest of the day went well.

There wasn&#39;t too much criticism, there wasn&#39;t a whole lot of aloud 
confrontations, and about the worst that had gotten shot at Tomo and 
Yomi for the rest of the day had been evil looks, and the sound of 
gossip of course was always there.

They weren&#39;t exactly singled out at lunch, but the person that sat 
nearest to either of them was a good five feet away. He didn&#39;t really 
seem to care, nor did the ones who had sat down at the same table in the 
first place. Either way, it was an uninterrupted lunch, and while 
neither girl was about to say that they were happy with this, they were 
satisfied for now. The day could have been a whole lot worse.

Of course, once some of the boys started to follow Mr. Kimura&#39;s way of 
thinking, it probably would get worse, but again, that was something 
that came with the package.

After Lunch, Yomi and Tomo were separated for one period, one of two 
times in the day that that would be. Yomi had Fifth Period Gym Class, 
and Tomo had Fifth Period Music Class, a Class Yomi had elected not to 
take After that, Yomi had Sixth Period Gym, to Tomo&#39;s Sixth Period 
English, as in American English. &#39;See ya Seventh Period.&#39; was all that 
was said from Yomi to Tomo and Tomo to Yomi. A hug, a kiss, nothing like 
that would have been necessary, and would have caused way too much 
attention. The girls had learned that there was a time and a place for 
everything.

As Yomi walked, she worried. Her and Nyamo Kurosawa, the Gym teacher at 
school, had gotten along fairly well, in the last two years at 
Chiyo-chan&#39;s beach house. Then again, the way things had been going, 
another rejection wouldn&#39;t have surprised Yomi in the least, and with 
her being the more pessimistic of the two, she didn&#39;t exactly have high 
hopes for any acceptance.

To Yomi&#39;s surprise, however, gym class went smoothly. As usual, she was 
one of the more flexible girls in the class, with only a few boys being 
able to beat her out, so stretches went well. After that, Ms. Kurosawa 
handed out some basketballs and, after a brief lecture on sports safety, 
everyone had a free day in gym class. The best part? While nobody came 
out and straight up said it, nobody seemed to have any problems with 
Yomi. She wasn&#39;t picked last for the pick up basketball game, (matter of 
fact, she was picked first, by one of the boys that was known for his 
perversion, but Yomi wasn&#39;t really complaining at this point), none of 
the girls on the other team were afraid to play defense on her, and 
overall, it was fun.

The period was drawing to a close, and everybody was sweating and 
playing somewhat sloppily. Somebody went up for a shot, and Yomi, on 
defense, went for a block, but missed, and lightly smacked the guy on 
the noggin.

&quot;Oh my, I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Yomi bowed apologetically. They guy just rubbed his 
face in his shirt and bowed back. Then, however, the blow of a whistle 
was heard, and everybody looked to see Nyamo, Ms. Kurosawa standing 
there. She was looking straight at Yomi.

&quot;Gotta step up, Yomi, but don&#39;t get sloppy.&quot; Nyamo said, sounding like 
the true sports critic that she was. Yomi just bowed again.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot; She was always respectful to her teachers. Even Mr. 
Kimura, to the extent that one could be. As Yomi began to turn her back, 
Nyamo blew her whistle again, drwaing her attention back once again.

&quot;Your dad dropped something off for you in the office, Yomi. Come with 
me, please.&quot; Nyamo turned her back and began to walk away. Immediatley, 
and with great interest, Yomi followed her. What could her father have 
sent her? An apology? Could it not wait till later? An &#39;I&#39;m Sorry&#39; note 
that her mother was too proud to give? As Nyamo held the double doors to 
the Gym open, Yomi passed through, and the former addressed the class 
one last time. &quot;You all have roughly five minutes before the bell rings. 
Clean everything up and be ready to go, or you guys won&#39;t see the Gym 
again until the spring.&quot; She never yelled, but she made her students 
listen. That was the great thing about Nyamo.

Yomi had already started to walk to the main building of the school when 
she heard the doors shut to the Gym, and once again, the voice of Nyamo.

&quot;Hold it, Yomi. We&#39;re not going to the office.&quot; Surprised, Yomi turned 
around, and was already face to face with her Gym teacher

&quot;But you-&quot; Yomi cut herself off. She knew now. Her father hadn&#39;t sent 
her anything.

&quot;I had to get you out of there without raising any suspicion.&quot; Nyamo 
said, sympathetically. She placed a hand on Yomi&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Look, I 
know some of the kids are giving you a tough time, and I&#39;m more than 
sure that Yukari hasn&#39;t been easy either?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not really come out and said it, but...&quot;

&quot;But you know?&quot;

&quot;But we know.&quot;

&quot;Well, I plan to talk to her later, and any of my students that give you 
trouble in this class, or Tomo in hers. I don&#39;t see it being too much of 
a problem though.&quot; Wow, Yomi thought, Nyamo really knew how to comfort 
sombody. She couldn&#39;t help but smile.

&quot;Thanks, Ms. Kurosawa.&quot; Yomi said, still smiling. Maybe it had been the 
fact that Yomi wasn&#39;t expecting sympathy or kindness. Maybe it had been 
the fact that her classmates that period had been so friendly. Yomi 
didn&#39;t know why, but she was happy that now, she had somebody that she 
could talk to during the school day, should problems arise. Nyamo was 
really a great person.

&quot;I don&#39;t have a problem, and I&#39;m here if you need me.&quot; She moved her 
hand up and ruffled Yomi&#39;s hair slightly, then took a step back. &quot;You 
better go on, or the kids are going to think something is up.&quot; Yomi 
nodded and headed back to the locker room, where she would change and be 
on her way. It had been an average day up until that point, and now, 
Yomi was beginning to see the light through the darkness.

Tomo and Yomi were together again in seventh period, Math class, the 
last class of the day. Both took seats near the window, and had a very 
brief talk before class started.

&quot;Boy, do I have good news to tell when we get home.&quot; Yomi said. She was 
still smiling brightly from Nyamo&#39;s show of kindness. Tomo, on the other 
hand, had a very paranoid look on her face, and she kept her bag inside 
of her desk, though her hand never left the handle.

&quot;Same here, Yomi. Same here.&quot; Her voice was on the borderline of 
breaking at a few points, and Yomi began to worry.

&quot;Tomo, are you-&quot; But the concern for her girlfriend was cut off by the 
ringing of the bell, and the teacher entering the room.

&quot;Well, class, you may think that just because it&#39;s the first day of 
school, we can all just slack off.&quot; Said the Math Teacher, a Middle Aged 
man with a black toupe. &quot;Well, I have news for you. Arithmetic doesn&#39;t 
care what day it is! Pull those Textbooks out of your desk and open them 
to page Thirty-Five.&quot; There were many sighs and cries of tired anguish 
from the class, but in the end, they gave way to the Old School Teacher, 
and the work began.

About fifty minutes later, the final bell rang. They&#39;d done it. Yomi and 
Tomo had made it through their first day of school as a lesbian couple 
in one piece.

Not waiting for the crowds to dim, the two girls were out the door 
immediatley, and a few minutes later, they were walking down one of the 
backroads that curved behind the school, and would eventually take them 
home.

&quot;So, what&#39;s you&#39;re good news?&quot; Tomo asked, cheerfully. She seemed much 
more calm and collected than she was an hour ago. Yomi noted this 
happily, and responded, telling the story of what Nyamo had said. She 
was able to recite it damn near word for word. After all, Nyamo&#39;s words 
had been the highlight of Yomi&#39;s day, and she wouldn&#39;t easily forget 
them.

&quot;Basically,&quot; Yomi recapped when she was finished. &quot;Anytime we need to, 
we can go to Nyamo, and she&#39;ll help us. Great, ain&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Sure is,&quot; Tomo replied. &quot;But why didn&#39;t she tell me this?&quot; Yomi thought 
for a moment, but was quickly able to put two and two together.

&quot;Well, if she&#39;d pulled both of us out of class, even if she was saying 
that it was for something else, like to be taken to the office, or 
something like that, people probably would have figured it out. In my PE 
class, I didn&#39;t hear the word Lesbian, Dyke, or anything like that, at 
all. I don&#39;t think she wanted to give them a reason to single me out.&quot;

&quot;Ahh...&quot; Tomo understood better now. She may have been the practical 
one, but when it came to Inductive Reasoning, Yomi was the one to go to, 
hands down.

&quot;So, what about your news, hon?&quot; Yomi inquired. She was finally able to 
be affectionate out loud. Nobody was on this road but Tomo and Yomi. 
Tomo just smirked.

&quot;Oh, you&#39;ll see when we get home.&quot; All she did was pat her bag and 
continue walking. Yomi arched an eyebrow, but though she was curious, 
she could wait, and decided to strike up a conversation about something 
else.

&quot;So, how was your PE class?&quot; Yomi asked.

&quot;Oh, it was...&quot;

For the next twenty minutes, Tomo and Yomi walked and talked, talked and 
walked. If one were to walk by at this point, or if one were to 
eavesdrop on the conversation, knowing that Yomi and Tomo were 
girlfriends, one would probably think, &#39;These two don&#39;t sound like 
teenage girl fuck buddies. If anything, they sound like a married, 
lesbian couple who love each other, and not just each others bodies.&#39; 
And of course, one would be exactly right.

Finally, they arrived at the house. Yomi pulled the house key out of her 
bag, unlocked the door, and held it open for Tomo, who went inside and 
immediatley began to close all of the windows and blinds on the ground 
floor of the house. This did nothing but peak Yomi&#39;s curiosity further, 
as she suspected it had something to do with her news.

&quot;Hey, what&#39;re you-&quot; Then she saw the dirty dishes from this morning. 
&quot;Just come in the kitchen when you want to talk, hon.&quot; With that, Yomi 
rolled up her sleeves and walked into the kitchen, where she would put 
on her apron and begin to wash the dishes.

A few minutes later, Tomo walked in and sat her bag down at the table. 
After catching her breath, she pulled a chair up, and sat down, 
beginning to undo the straps on the bag. Yomi turned to confirm that it 
was Tomo, then looked back to the dishes she was washing.

&quot;So, what&#39;s the big news?&quot; Yomi asked bluntly. Tomo stopped what she was 
doing for a moment and stood up.

&quot;Well, remember how I told you Kimura was giving me a hard time in 
American English?&quot; Tomo started by using an event to lead into her 
point.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Yomi responded. &quot;Couldn&#39;t you like, report him for that?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think so. It wasn&#39;t really anything he said. It was the staring 
and the innuendo he put into his teachings.&quot; There was a bit of silence, 
where the only sound that could be heard was the water running out of 
the sink, and the occasional clank of a plate that Yomi sat down to dry 
off later. Tomo broke the silence quickily. &quot;But that&#39;s not the point.&quot;

&quot;Then do you care to get to it?&quot;

&quot;Well, anyways. After class, somebody came up to me.&quot;

&quot;Who is this sombody?&quot;

&quot;Do you know Tamika Hamisaki?&quot;

&quot;Short, black hair, big scar on her forehead?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s the one.&quot;

&quot;What about her?&quot;

&quot;Well, she came up to me.&quot; Tomo said, now opening her bag, and reaching 
in, fiddling around with a zipper pocket on the inside. &quot;And told me she 
knew that I was going through tough times.&quot; Yomi listened, but she was 
now growing concerned. Tomo wasn&#39;t exactly the easiest person in the 
world to trick. &quot;So we went up on the roof, and a few of her friends 
told me they knew exactly what I needed, and for a small price, they 
could give it to me.&quot;

Yomi was freaking out in her mind. &#39;Please, do not let her have done 
what I think she&#39;s done.&#39; On the outside, though, she was able to keep a 
calm demeanor. &quot;What was the price?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, sweets, I covered it.&quot; Tomo gave that cheesy smile of 
hers. Yomi played along.

&quot;Alright,&quot; She said, now eyeing the bag. Tomo had her hand in, as Yomi 
could see, the zipper pocket on the inside, and the was she was holding 
it didn&#39;t relenquish her fears one bit. &quot;But what&#39;s this remedy, if you 
will?&quot;

&quot;This.&quot; Tomo pulled it all out quickly and without hesitation. In one 
hand, she held a metal razor, about an inch long and three wide, with a 
sharp tip at each end. There were also two straws, one metal and one of 
a very hard plastic. In the other hand, there was a zip-loc bag, full of 
a white, squishy powder.

Tomo had purchased a few pounds of Cocaine.

Yomi wasn&#39;t in the least bit surprised, but she wasn&#39;t at all happy. She 
dropped the dish she was working on, almost breaking it, and got right 
up in Tomo&#39;s face.

&quot;What were you thinking!&quot; She didn&#39;t scream, but her voice held a great 
deal of anger. &quot;Might I remind you that you hold ILLEGAL DRUGS in your 
hands!&quot; Tomo was spazzing.

&quot;Yomi, Yomi, Yomi! Shhhh! Somebody will hear you.&quot; There was a moment of 
silence, Yomi stared at Tomo, noticabley pissed. Tomo stared back, with 
her trademark &#39;Just give me a chance&#39; look on her face. In the end, Tomo 
won, with Yomi plopping down in the chair beside of her, her head 
hanging back, and her hands cluching her skull.

&quot;How much did you pay?&quot; Yomi asked, her voice dragging, as if she knew 
she wasn&#39;t going to like the answer.

&quot;Just Four Thousand Yen. It wasn&#39;t that much.&quot; Yomi just sighed and slid 
down deeper into her chair.

&quot;Well, get it over with, Tomo.&quot; Tomo nodded in response. First, she laid 
down a piece of paper. Then, taking a handfull of the Cocaine, she 
placed it on the paper, using the razor to form it all into a line, then 
to divide it into small, inch long strips. There were nine of these. 
Taking a deep breath, she took the plastic straw, placing it into her 
nose. She placed it on the first line, and slowly, began to snort.

The sound was sickening to Yomi, but when it stopped, she looked up. 
Tomo had finished the first line, and Yomi could already see it in her 
eyes. She was high, and it was only going to get worse as Tomo went down 
on the second line.

Then, curiosity got the better of Yomi, she stood up, and walked beside 
Tomo, holding out her hand.

&quot;The straw, dear.&quot; Tomo just smiled and handed it over.

&quot;I want it back when you&#39;re done, baby.&quot; Just by the tone of her voice, 
Yomi knew that Tomo was high. However, curiosity had gotten the better 
of her, and Yomi went down on the third line and began to snort.

The drug entered her System, but immediatley, it did nothing for Yomi, 
who sat back down, placing the straw back down on the paper. Tomo took 
the straw and, with her pupils in the process of dialating, looked at 
Yomi questionabley.

&quot;Does nothing for me.&quot; Yomi said truthfully. &quot;It&#39;s all yours.&quot; Her lover 
just smiled and proceeded to continue.

Tomo went down on the fifth line, then the sixth, then the seventh, and 
so on until she was done. Not just with that handfull, but with the 
whole bag, which turned into about twenty more lines. In the end, she 
was breathing heavily, and couldn&#39;t stay still at all.

&quot;Is there more?&quot; Tomo asked. Oh, how high she was. It didn&#39;t help at all 
that that was her first time. Yomi shook her head, also breathing a 
little hard. The one line she had done earlier was starting to come back 
to her, but it wouldn&#39;t affect her near as much as the other eight had 
affected Tomo. &quot;Oh well, just gotta get more tomorrow!&quot; Tomo went into 
the living room and laid down on the couch and began to channel surf, 
though Yomi was sure that she didn&#39;t know what was going on half the 
time. She just sighed, and went back to cleaning the dishes.

&#39;I&#39;ll talk to her about it later.&#39; Yomi thought. &#39;Not gonna let her get 
addicted. Although...no, no. It was bad. Don&#39;t even think otherwise.&#39; 
For now, she was the one in control. Though every now and then, Yomi 
couldn&#39;t help but look back, and take a long look at where that Coke had 
been earlier.

Maybe she would talk to Nyamo about this tomorrow.

Maybe.</pre>
