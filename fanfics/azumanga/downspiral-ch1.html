<h1>Downward Spiral (part 1 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../azumanga/index.html">Azumanga Daioh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/paec.html">PAEC</a><br> </h2>
<pre>A warm, midsummers day in Tokyo, Japan. Another, in fact. A day like 
this brought a wonderful feeling of deja vu to the mind of Koyomi 
Mizuhara, a Second Year in High School. Welcome deja vu indeed, of the 
fateful day at Magical Land, the day when she had let everything out. 
Confessed it all. Come out of the closet, come clean, any term one 
wishes to use. She&#39;d come out about her feelings for her best friend, a 
friend who she&#39;d wanted more from. All had gone according to plan, or at 
least the ideal plan. Because on that day, two weeks ago, she&#39;d gotten 
the one thing she&#39;d always wanted from the person she&#39;d always wanted it 
from. Young Yomi had found love, and now, she was on her way to meet 
that special young woman who&#39;d given it to her.

She didn&#39;t have to wait long, either. As she took a left, rounding the 
block to the house she was headed to, the person she was going to meet 
was already awaiting her on the curb. Tomo Takino, also a Second Year in 
High School, waited, her face lighting up when she saw Yomi finally come 
around the corner. The sparkle that lit up in her eyes at the sight of 
her lover greatly complimented her short, black hair. At least, that was 
how Yomi felt about it.

&quot;Yomi!&quot; Tomo jogged up to greet her girlfriend, giving her a quick peck 
on the lips. This was customary for the both of them when they met. A 
simple show of their affection, the deeper and more powerful stuff was 
saved for the moments when it seemed appropriate. &quot;So, you said you 
wanted to talk about something, hun?&quot; Tomo added on the title of her 
lover in a more sarcastic tone than anything else. Even if this was a 
serious relationship, Tomo, being the one person to never take anything 
seriously, tried to make it fun. And Yomi wouldn&#39;t have it any other 
way.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Came Yomi&#39;s reply, as she still held the young woman in her 
arms. The hug slowly slipped, and a moment later the two were just 
sitting down on the steps leading up to Tomo&#39;s home, hand in hand.

&quot;Well, we can&#39;t take too long,&quot; Tomo said before Yomi could continue on. 
Spontaneous, as always. Another trait that seemed to make Tomo stand out 
from the rest of the &#39;gang&#39; of friends that the two would hang out with. 
&quot;The others will be waiting for us&quot;

&quot;Actually, Tomo...&quot; Yomi trailed off, before heaving in a heavy sigh, 
and a second later, continuing on. &quot;We need to&quot;

&quot;...to tell them. Right?&quot; Tomo finished the sentence that Yomi had 
started. This too was common. One would start the sentence, the other 
would finish. To the two young girls, it was merely a spiritual showing 
of their compatibility for one another. Yomi simply nodded, as though 
she&#39;d been afraid to say it. &quot;I&#39;ve been considering it too.&quot; Tomo 
continued. She told no lies to Yomi anymore. This was a sincere moment 
for Tomo Takino. Something completely rare for the normally untamed 
wildcat High School Girl, as she was self proclaimed. But this time, 
Tomo too understood the significance. &quot;It&#39;s been two weeks, and 
everytime we&#39;re late&quot;

&quot;...they grow more and more suspicious that we&#39;re leaving them out of 
something.&quot; It was Yomi&#39;s turn to finish. A nod from Tomo told Yomi that 
she had been completely correct in her assumption. Yomi agreed. &quot;But we 
have to tell them. There&#39;s no big deal. They&#39;re our friends, Tomo.&quot; Tomo 
stood up, nodding, a determined look on her face.

&quot;You&#39;re right! You&#39;re absolutely right. They&#39;ll stick with us, no matter 
what we become!&quot; Tomo was on fire right now. Yomi just chuckled, 
standing up and placing a comforting hand on the hyper young woman&#39;s 
shoulder.

&quot;That&#39;s the spirit.&quot; The two smiled at each other for a moment. Yomi 
continued. &quot;You put it into good perspective for me, Tomo. I don&#39;t know 
why I ever had any doubt.&quot; Tomo returned the loving smile, before a 
sudden shocked expression hit her face.

&quot;Well then, we don&#39;t want to have them mad at us from the get-go, now do 
we? Lets go!&quot; Tomo did an about face, and with her hyperactive bursts, 
she was off before Yomi could even blink.

&quot;H-Hey! Wait up!&quot; Yomi shouted, before running after Tomo, who would not 
get very far, seeing as how she was all adrenaline and no stamina. For 
Yomi, it was the exact opposite, and soon, the two were jogging side by 
side. At that point, not a drop of doubt existed in either mind, that 
this next visit with their friends could go wrong. Everything would be 
alright, it would go exactly according to plan, just as their confession 
to one another had. But lightning never strikes the same place twice.</pre>
