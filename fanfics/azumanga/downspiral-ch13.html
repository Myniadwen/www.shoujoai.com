<h1>Downward Spiral (part 13 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../azumanga/index.html">Azumanga Daioh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/paec.html">PAEC</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../azumanga/downspiral-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Well, after reading some reviews, and taking some time to slow down, I 
want to make two statements, both of which I will go into more depth 
about after I finish the Fic. One, this Fanfiction has gone completely 
as planned from beginning to end. Everything I&#39;ve done was my original 
idea, and the reviews and outside opinions did not change that. 
Everything that has happened was planned. Two, the reason it seemed like 
it all happened so fast? It was supposed to. Sometimes, a quick recap 
fits a story better than a full, hands on account. I felt that was the 
case here. Anyway, we got two chapters to go. Let&#39;s get down to it.

All Apologies

Monday, March 24th, 9:07 AM. Tokyo.

For the third year Students, the Seniors, this was it. On Friday, they 
would be graduating. Some would move onto College, and for the rest, 
their School years were almost over.

What then, would the last week of school be? Not much. For those who 
didn&#39;t skip for the last week, School was more or less something to do 
if you didn&#39;t have anything better to do at home. Most of the time was 
spent sitting in home room all day, doing whatever. Some would play 
cards, or various other games brought in. Others would chat. Some would 
even watch Television, if one was present in the room.

To the surprise of the students in Ms. Yukari&#39;s home-room, the latter 
was the case. Yukari, defying all odds, had actually put some effort in 
to bringing a Television Set into her class-room for the day.

&quot;Why? Becuase I don&#39;t want you all using your free time to bother me.&quot; 
Which was what Yukari had said, right before she lay her head down on a 
pillow she had brought with her, and falling into a deep snooze. That 
was Ms. Yukari for you.

For the most part, the TV went unused. Most of the students just sat 
around talking and playing some of the aforementioned games. Then, about 
halfway through the class, Chiyo and Sakaki got bored of playing Jin 
Rummy, and decided to set down and watch the TV.

&quot;What do you want to watch, Chiyo?&quot; Sakaki asked. She didn&#39;t really care 
all that much.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter to me.&quot; Chiyo really didn&#39;t either. After some 
silence, Chiyo had an idea. &quot;How about the news?&quot; Sakaki nodded.

&quot;Yeah, I doubt there&#39;s anything else on right now anyway.&quot; She 
responded. Chiyo nodded and pressed the Power button on the TV, then 
surfed to channel seven, the local news.

It took either of them a moment to take in what they were seeing, but 
once it hit them...

&quot;Oh...Oh...&quot; Sakaki stammered. Chiyo would finish it with a yell.

&quot;OH MY GOD!&quot; She screamed, clinging to Sakaki and burying her face the 
latter&#39;s leg. Between Chiyo&#39;s high pitched voice, and the volume of the 
yell, even Yukari was awoken in a panic.

Everyone gathered around the Television, and not a soul in that room was 
happy at what they saw.

News Channel Seven, Live Report. 9:42 AM, Monday, March 24th, Tokyo

A woman in her twenties, with long black hair, and a red business suit, 
held a microphone and was reporting on something. Behind her, was a run 
down apartment building in down town Tokyo. An ambulance, a body bag, 
and some workers could also be seen.

&quot;The body of a young girl was found today, hanging from a noose, off of 
a third floor apartment fire escape this morning.&quot;

A picture of Yomi came up on the screen, her eyes closed, and the 
indintation of a rope was marked into her limp neck.

&quot;Koyomi Mizuhara, age Sixteen, of Tokyo, was found hanging from a noose. 
From the finger prints on the rope, and the way she was found, this has 
been dubbed a suicide. And now, we take it over to Shingiwa Minamoto, in 
uptown Tokyo, for a related story.

The camera flashed now to a short, middle aged man with no hair, who was 
standing outside of a house that some of the girls found very familiar. 
The house of Tomo Takino.

&quot;Another young girl was found dead today, inside her Tokyo home.&quot;

The camera now flashed on a picture of Tomo, being zipped up into a body 
bag.

&quot;Tomo Takino, sixteen, of Tokyo, was found dead today, when the 
neighbors complained about the smell of drugs coming from the upstairs 
window. When the authorities came, Ms. Takino was found dead in the 
upstairs bedroom of her two story house. She was found in a sleeping 
bag, and an autopsy showed two pounds of Cocaine in her system, all 
ingested at the time of death. Tomika, back to you.&quot;

The camera cut to a female news anchor in a studio. Long blonde hair, 
mid thirties.

&quot;Thank you Shin. After talking to some of the locals, the two were 
identified as Lesbian lovers, who had reciently dropped out of high 
school. While the father of Ms. Takino is currently away in America on 
active duty, the mother of Ms. Mizuhara refused to comment. In other 
news, the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch was found toady...&quot;

The rest didn&#39;t matter to anyone in that room. While blind sympathy was 
what came from most of the students, five girls in that room new 
otherwise. Kagura, Sakaki, Chiyo, and Osaka took Yukari outside, and the 
five of them had a talk.

&quot;It&#39;s all our fault.&quot; Chiyo said. Nobody else had the courage to speak 
up. She was right. &quot;It&#39;s our fault guys.&quot; Chiyo said again. &quot;And we-&quot; 
She was cut off by Kagura, who if anything, was the most to blame for 
this.

&quot;And we have to make it right.&quot; She said.

&quot;But how&#39;re we gonna do that?&quot; Osaka stated, on the verge of tears. 
There was silence for a moment, until Sakaki spoke up, a depressing look 
in her eyes.

&quot;The last thing we can do.&quot; After a moment of thinking, everyone nodded 
in agreement.</pre>
