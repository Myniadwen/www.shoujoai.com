Further Down the Spiral

Within minutes, they found themselves back at the for in the path. 
Though it had taken Tomo Takino and Yomi Mizuhara a great amount of time 
to walk from this point to the house of Tomo, as they had done about an 
hour earlier, the journey back was much more appropriate, time wise, for 
now, a small ray of hope shined inside of the girls.

All in a single day, they had made a decision that was supposed to have 
made their lives easier. Shortly thereafter, they were shunned by their 
closest friends, shell-shocked at how their revelation has been 
received, not with arms wide open, but with prejudice and denial. Even 
as they walked to come out to their parents, fearing the worst if word 
got to them by any means other than Tomo and Yomi telling them 
themselves, both girls felt for sure that the response from both sides 
would be none the better.

But then, for the first time in this tale, there was hope.

Mr. Takino, Tomo&#39;s father, had listened to their story, and in the end, 
it made no difference to him that his daughter was a lesbian, and after 
sharing his own news with Tomo and Yomi about being stationed in America 
for the next two years, he had told the girls something that had added 
on to the already existing joy of acceptance.

Now, with the promise of a place that the two could call home, there was 
but one last thing to be one, one last variable to be determined in 
their equation.

Not unknown to the girls, but unfortunate none the less, was the fact 
that all signs pointed to a bleak conclusion for this particular 
variable. Because this last variable was Koyomi Mizuhara Senior.

Yomi&#39;s mother, whom she was named after. Yomi Sr. had graduate Tokyo 
university, leaving with a four year degree in Theology, and was a proud 
and active believer in the Christianity religion. Though she was 
Japanese, Yomi Sr. had been born in America, and after spending a summer 
there with her great grandparents when she was about seven years old, 
had picked up on the American Religion of Christianity. From that point 
on, Yomi. Sr. dropped her family beliefs on Shinto, their Japanese 
religion, and began to study Christianity. Even though it wasn&#39;t big in 
Japan, the Theology field was general enough for Yomi Sr. to be able to 
get her degree and still hold on to her beliefs. At the end of the day, 
Yomi Sr. was the kind of person who probably knew the &#39;Word of God&#39; 
BETTER than she knew the back of her own hand. Everyone has a hobby, 
some carry it farther and call it a passion, something that goes beyond 
everything else they do. If one were to ask Yomi Sr. what her passion 
was, the answer would be &#39;The Study of Christianity&#39; every time. She did 
not reword that, nor did she mythically paraphrase it. Those four words 
were exactly what she would say every time, for it was all that she felt 
needed to be said.

She did not work, at least not in the sense of a Nine to Five kind of 
job, like her husband did. Though there would be times when Tokyo U&#39;s 
theology department, as well as other religion schools around the area, 
would call her up to come up for some daily assistance, which usually 
brought in a fair sum of money whenever she was called on. Between that 
and her husbands business workings, the Mizuhara family lived well, 
financially.

Yomi knew that her mom would go absolutely crazy, in the worst possible 
way, when she learned that her daughter was homosexual. It went against 
what she believed in, that romantic relationships be between anybody but 
a man and a woman, and Yomi Sr. stood by what she believed in, like an 
old dog would stand by his master.

But at this point in time, as the two girls turned and began to walk 
down the right side of the fork, following its path, they made the 
mistake of trying to believe.

They had, more or less, been shunned by Kagura, Sakaki, Osaka, Kaorin, 
and Chiyo-chan, (who had probably been told what the problem was by 
now). But those five, they were children. By the logic of Tomo and Yomi, 
the mind of an adult was more mature, and therefore more open to 
possibility and difference. The conclusion was drawn from the fact that 
Mr. Takino had so easily been able to comprehend and accept this 
newfound love, as far as the two were concerned. Yomi&#39;s mother was a 
college graduate of four years, and looking to go back for four more for 
a PHD, and a woman who usually held all the answers to her daughters 
questions. Surely then, even an active theologist such as Koyomi Sr. 
could understand and welcome this decision, if anything, just to support 
Yomi, one who she should love regardless.

That was the desirable ending.

Normal pace and all, to took the girls all of about five minutes to walk 
the distance from the fork in the path to where they stood now.

It may have been a single story house, and not exactly a great looking 
one on the outside, but Koyomi Mizuhara Sr. had definitely made the most 
of it. If one looked past size and exterior, the house was absolutely 
beautiful, as Yomi Sr. had spared no expense to interior design.

On the inside, Yomi&#39;s heart had began to feel heavier and heavier with 
each step that took her closer and closer to her home. Though she did 
not let it show, which would have ruined this wonderful hope that Tomo 
was now experiencing, Yomi knew. Her initial hope had faded, and she had 
fallen back to reality. She feared this meeting, for she knew exactly 
what the outcome was going to be, and knew that even divine intervention 
wouldn&#39;t change it.

Then, upon finally seeing her house, Yomi&#39;s heart had hit rock bottom.

She&#39;d tried to prepare herself, but at the sigh of her mother, it had 
all fallen apart on the inside for Yomi. Once again, she knew that the 
next events about to happen were truly etched in stone, and there would 
be no changing them. The mere sight of her mother confirmed it. In 
Yomi&#39;s mind, the variable was solved, and the equation was about to turn 
out bad.

Koyomi stood before them.

With the exception of height, Yomi&#39;s mother was just about a fun-hose 
mirror image of Yomi herself. Where Yomi had long, brown hair, her 
mothers was short and rose-blonde. Jr. had glasses, Sr. had perfect 
twenty-twenty vision, and not to say that Yomi was fat, or that her 
mother was undeveloped, both by comparison, but when it came down to 
body figure, Yomi was larger in every way. Though in irony, Koyomi was a 
great cook and loved to eat. A doctor however had once told Koyomi that 
her metabolism was abnormally fast, answering the question of why she 
never put on any pounds. Sometimes, daughter and mother would joke about 
each others weight in this sense. Though right now, that was the 
absolute last thing on Yomi&#39;s mind.

And now, Yomi and Tomo&#39;s decision was the cherry on top of it all, the 
thing that would seal Yomi and her mother as true bi-polar opposites, so 
to speak. Yomi could now do nothing but hope for the best of the worst.

Koyomi had been outside watering her flower garden, when the sound of 
approaching footsteps on the stone path leading up to her house entered 
her ears. As she turned, she met the two girls with a look of curiosity.

&quot;Oh, Yomi, Tomo.&quot; She gave daughter and her daughters best friend, as 
far as she knew, a serene smile to go alone with the look of curiosity. 
The fact of the matter was that Koyomi was a very nice person, and part 
of the emotional pain for Yomi was the fact that she was about to tell 
her mother something that would break her heart.

But this was something that had to be done.

&quot;Is the ball game already over?&quot; Koyomi asked, but already suspected 
something. She knew that the time the girls had been gone would barely 
had been enough to get to the ballpark and back.

&quot;Well...we...uhmm...that is to say...&quot; Yomi was visibly struggling. Oh, 
how hard this was for her. Tomo observed both that fact, and the fact of 
Koyomi&#39;s growing concern. Quickly, she took charge of the situation 
before Koyomi could jump to her own conclusions, which could only make 
this more difficult.

&quot;It&#39;s a bit of a story, ma&#39;am.&quot; Tomo tried to illustrate the point, 
while at the same time, be brief as possible. &quot;We should probably go 
inside. Plus, Mr. Mizuhara may want to hear this too. May we?&quot; With an 
arched brow, Koyomi nodded and opened the door, ushering the two girls 
into the house and following them in, quickly shutting the door behind 
her. Her suspicion was rising faster than would do the girls any good.

For you see, Tomo had already made a mistake of being out of her own 
character.

Who was this girl that looked like Tomo? Calm, formal, polite? This was 
not the girl Koyomi&#39;s daughter had grown up alongside, and the observant 
Senior Mizuhara had picked up on that.

At the sam time, though, Koyomi hadn&#39;t the slightest idea of what to 
make of the situation. In a sense, that worked to the girls immediate 
advantage.

The first sound the girls heard upon entering the house was the sound of 
the TV. The door leading to the exit of the house brought them into the 
living room, where a High Definition Television was placed, surrounded 
by three sofas, a coffee table, and various pictures hung up around the 
room. Sitting on the center sofa, leaned back and relaxed, sat Mr. 
Mizuhara, Yomi&#39;s father, channel surfing attempting to find something to 
watch. His curiosity rose also when he saw Tomo and Yomi enter the room.

&quot;Well, hey girls.&quot; Mr. Mizuhara said, his voice more curious than 
welcoming. &quot;Who won?&quot; Yomi&#39;s dad never doubted what his daughter did. If 
she said she was going to a baseball game with her friends, then when 
she came home, her father assumed that she&#39;d been to a baseball game. He 
trusted her, and Yomi loved him to death for it. She prayed that his 
love could continue through this.

&quot;No-&quot; Tomo was about to say, but Koyomi didn&#39;t give her the chance.

&quot;Tomo said there was something that we needed to hear, darling.&quot; Koyomi 
always made sure the story she heard was the one that he heard, nothing 
fabricated. She looked at the two girls. &quot;Have a seat and do tell, 
honey.&quot; She took her own seat beside her husband, while Yomi and Tomo 
sat on the couch to their left. For a moment there was nothing. Then 
Tomo decided to start.

&quot;We didn&#39;t end up going with the girls to the game.&quot; She started with 
calmness that both parents saw as unnatural. &quot;We told our friends about 
this, we told my dad about this. You&#39;re the last two that need to know. 
So now you get to know.&quot;

&quot;Go on.&quot; Koyomi said simply. Mr. Mizuhara also nodded, as to agree. Tomo 
sighed heavily, as if preparing herself.

&quot;We&#39;re-&quot; Again, she was cut off, this time by a vice grip like hug from 
Yomi, who had small tears in her eyes.

&quot;We&#39;re in love!&quot; Yomi proclaimed loudly, as she held on to Tomo, her 
eyes shut tightly. &quot;We&#39;re in love. I thought she was just a friend when 
we first met, but over time, I&#39;ve realized I care for Tomo, deeply. She 
feels the same way.&quot; This statement was met with a nervous nod by Tomo, 
who did her best to free an arm and place it around Yomi, who wasn&#39;t 
quite done. &quot;It may go against everything you go for, but I can&#39;t help 
it. This is the way it has become for us, and now you know.&quot; There was a 
long, long silence. Mr. Mizuhara looked thoughtful, but Koyomi was 
completely shocked, at a loss for words. In the dead silence, Yomi 
opened her eyes. Had it gone okay? Had it? Any reason for either girl to 
think that it had gone okay slowly melted away, as the expression on 
Koyomi&#39;s face slowly changed from emotionlessness, to rage.

&quot;You...&quot; Koyomi stammered with the words, bu there was no denying that 
the words she found would not be pretty. &quot;You&#39;re no daughter of mine!&quot; 
Her tone quickly changed, and even Mr. Mizuhara jumped at the sudden 
rise in volume. &quot;I&#39;ll have no daughter that&#39;s a dyke! I&#39;ll condemn no 
daughter of mine to hell for such things!&quot;Tears were now in Yomi&#39;s eyes, 
and Tomo was doing her best to comfort her, though she herself was 
slowly breaking out into tears too. Koyomi continued her rampage. 
&quot;Anything from you room that you want, pack it. I want you out! I don&#39;t 
care where you go, but I want you out! Honey, come get me when that 
little...ugh is gone!&quot; Koyomi immediately turned and walked away, 
heading out the back door. Mr. Mizuhara was shell-shocked. He looked to 
his wife, his daughter, his wife, his daughter again, before finally 
giving up. He took one last look at Tomo and Yomi, and with true 
sincerity, he spoke.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, girls.&quot; With that he turned and ran after his wife, though 
he knew that he had no power to change her mind.

Yomi and Tomo knew that her dad meant what he had said. Unfortunately, 
he was in the kind of relationship with Koyomi that gave him little 
decision power. His wife was just hard headed, and had it been up to 
him, the girls knew this probably would have been a lot better.

Tears running down their faces, they helped each other up, and slowly up 
to Yomi&#39;s room to pack. Tomo cried because her highest hopes had come 
crashing down, while Yomi cried because, while she knew this was the 
outcome, she had not planned on her mother completely disowning her so 
quickly. It was a heartbreaker that some people in this world couldn&#39;t 
look past what was skin deep, so to say.

Either way, it had all fallen back down, and now, Tomo Takino and Yomi 
Mizuhara, had fallen further down the spiral.

Authors Note: I tried to do my best to explain a few things, like why 
Koyomi was a Christian as opposed to a believer in Shinto, stuff like 
that. Overall, I like how the story is going. I know it seems a little 
out there that people would jump to such conclusions, but I know from 
experience that there are people in real life that can be so easily 
affected by one thing.
