<h1>What Dreams May Come</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../azumanga/index.html">Azumanga Daioh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tmakoto.html">Takino Makoto</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	&quot;Oh, Yomi!!&quot; Cried out Tomo, furiously bucking her hips against 
the taller girl&#39;s. They moaned loudly, together. &quot;Oh, Yomi, I think I&#39;m 
gonna.. gonna..&quot; She arched her back, lifting Yomi into the air, before 
sitting suddenly upright in bed, tossing the covers aside.

	Breathing hard, she could feel the wetness between her thighs. 
&quot;Another dream..&quot; she said to herself, sighing slightly. She exhaled, 
bowing her head down. &quot;Why don&#39;t I just tell her..&quot;

	Just then, her alarm rang out, shaking her from her thoughts, and 
nearly causing her to jump through the ceiling. &quot;Damn. Another school 
day..&quot; She thought, but then brightened, realizing that Yomi would be 
there. &quot;Today. I&#39;m going to do it today!&quot; She said to herself, but 
without much conviction.



*Later, at school*



	Changing for Nyamo&#39;s P.E. class, Tomo leaned against her locker, 
watching Yomi change.  &quot;She really is beautiful,&quot; The words drifted 
across her mind. She decided that then was as good a time as any to talk 
to her. But, before she had a chance..

	&quot;Hey, what are you staring at me like that for?&quot; Yomi challenged.

	Tomo was caught completely off guard. &quot;Wha- Me?&quot; She laughed, 
trying to think &quot;I was just wondering,&quot;

	&quot;Wondering What?&quot; Yomi asked, taking a half step towards the 
hyperactive girl.

	&quot;Anou.. Did you gain weight this weekend?&quot;



	It took Sakaki and Kagura ten minutes to pull Tomo back out of the 
locker.



*Yomi&#39;s House*



	Yomi walked into her room and tossed her backpack on her bed, then 
collapsed to her knees on the floor as tears began to run down her face.

	&quot;Dammit, Tomo..&quot; she mumbled.  She put on a brave face at school, 
and could pretend to shrug off Tomo&#39;s constant remarks about her weight, 
but in reality, each and every remark stuck with her and rang in her 
ears. Burying her face in her hands, she never heard the window open 
slowly.

	&quot;Yo!&quot; Tomo smiled. Then, noticing the tall crying girl kneeling in 
the center of the room, &quot;Hey, Yomi.. What&#39;s the matter.&quot; She started 
towards her, but Yomi&#39;s head popped up quickly.

	&quot;Why, Tomo!? Why are you always so mean?&quot; Tears ran openly down 
Yomi&#39;s face.

	&quot;Hey, hey, hey..&quot; Tomo said softly, kneeling down and pulling the 
other girl into an embrace. &quot;You know I don&#39;t mean those things..&quot;

	&quot;Then why do you always say them?&quot;

	Tomo pulled her closer, &quot;Because I&#39;m afraid..&quot;

	&quot;Afraid of what?&quot;

	&quot;Afraid of what might happen if I tell you what I&#39;m really 
thinking..&quot; Tomo said, lightly kissing Yomi&#39;s forehead.

	&quot;What.. what do you mean..&quot; Yomi started, blushing.

	&quot;This.&quot; Said Tomo, pulling Yomi to her and giving her a real kiss. 
She broke off, blushing. &quot;I&#39;ve wanted to do that for such a long time 
now..&quot;

	&quot;Tomo.&quot; Said Yomi, putting a hand on Tomo&#39;s shoulder, &quot;So have I.&quot;

	They pulled each other close and kissed deeply, neither wanting to 
break off.





	Yomi flopped down on her bed, and Tomo landed hard on top of her. 
&quot;Ow! Careful,&quot; Yomi said. Tomo responded by sticking out her tongue at 
her. Taking advantage of this, Yomi seized Tomo&#39;s tongue with her mouth.

	&quot;Eeeehhhn!&quot; Tomo tried to protest, but to no avail. She then 
pushed forward into a kiss.

	Both girls hands roamed over the other, removing various garments 
as they went, their lips never separating, even for a moment.

	Tomo leaned her head back, and Yomi happily began to kiss the 
front of her throat.  Moaning softly, Tomo arched further back, allowing 
Yomi to kiss and suck on her tender erect nipples. She then leaned back 
forward, kissing Yomi&#39;s neck and slowly working down.

	As she was massaging Yomi&#39;s breasts, the taller girl suddenly 
grabbed hold of her, and roughly flipped them both around, pinning Tomo 
on her back on the bed.

	Tomo, taken by surprise, looked to Yomi for an answer, and saw it 
in a mischievous sparkle in her eye. &quot;What.. what&#39;re you doing?&quot; Tomo 
asked, knowing full well the darker side of Yomi&#39;s personality.

	Yomi only chuckled, causing Tomo&#39;s throat to tighten slightly.

	&quot;I&#39;m gonna introduce you to my little friend,&quot; Said Yomi, 
mysteriously. &quot;I think you&#39;ll get along fine..&quot; With that, she produced 
a rather large vibrator.

	Tomo&#39;s eyes went wide with anxiety and excitement.. Tomo 
swallowed, noting to herself that the only thing that had ever 
penetrated her before was her own fingers. &quot;Yomi.. I don&#39;t know if I 
can-&quot;

	Yomi cut her off, &quot;Sure you can, it&#39;s easy. You won&#39;t even have to 
do anything.&quot; She flicked something, and a light electronic buzz rang in 
Tomo&#39;s ears.

	Yomi slowly ran the tip of the toy down Tomo&#39;s stomach, causing 
the small girl to tremble slightly. She teased the tip of Tomo&#39;s sex 
with it for a moment, then began to push.

	&quot;Ooh, God!&quot; Tomo cried softly, feeling the building pressure and 
steady vibration through her entire hip.

	Yomi pushed forward harder, surprised at how difficult it was. 
&quot;Wow, Tomo.. you&#39;re really tight..&quot; Tomo only moaned louder in response, 
arching her neck and massaging herself with her hands.

	Finally, Tomo&#39;s body relented, and the large toy began to slowly 
slip inside of her. Tomo began panting loudly and rapidly, feeling the 
vibrations echo through her, and feeling herself slowly filling with the 
huge object.

	The vibrations were already running through her like pleasurable 
fire when Yomi stopped, then began to slowly move the toy back and 
forth.. back and forth.

	Tomo unconsciously began to thrust against the movement within 
her.

	&quot;Oh, yeah, you like that?&quot; Asked Yomi.

	&quot;Oooohhh..&quot; was Tomo&#39;s only reply.

	&quot;Well, then, how about this?&quot; Yomi said, flicking another switch 
on the dildo.

	Tomo felt waves of pleasure crash over her as the vibrations 
intensified many times over. &quot;OH GOD, YOMI!!&quot; She cried out, thrusting 
harder and faster. Warm tingling  spread through her entire body, and 
her breath caught in her throat.

	Tomo felt her entire body tense, arching her back off of the bed,. 
and she felt an internal pressure througout building up.. building up 
until she was ready to burst...

	&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAaaaa!!&quot; Tomo screamed out in pleasure, her entire 
body convulsing, thrashing about.. She lay panting, feeling the wetness 
run between her thighs.

	She sat up, still shaking, and looked around.  Her own room.

	&quot;No... It can&#39;t be.. it just can&#39;t be a dream this time..&quot; The 
warmth still lingering below, she began to break down into sobs.. &quot;No.. 
no.. It had to be real..&quot;

	She looked over at the clock. 10pm. &quot;There&#39;s still time..&quot; She 
said to herself.

	&quot;Still time, still time, still time..&quot; she repeated over and over 
to herself, pulling on some clothes.

	She ran out the door and sprinted towards Yomi&#39;s house, determined 
not to hide herself any longer..
