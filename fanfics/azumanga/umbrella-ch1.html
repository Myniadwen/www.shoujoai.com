Drop

Drop

Drop

The rain poured form the sky heavily. Each drop cascaded down the leaves 
of the trees and onto the concrete roads of the city. The water 
splattered about the ground in a fashion that could be described as so 
loud it was quiet.

The sky was dark and bleak. It had been rainy all day, and there was 
little chances of it slowing anytime soon. The city park, usually lush 
and green, held a dismal look around it.

Most of the residents in the city found it best to stay indoors on these 
rainy days. Others, say as young children, had other views instead. They 
were out and about splashing through the puddles that littered the 
ground. Those who were unluckily caught in the down pour scurried about 
with their coats held tightly, each seeking out a place of shelter.

A girl walked through the park along one of the many pathways, light 
jacket over a sweater and an umbrella in her right hand. She couldn&#39;t 
have been older than seventeen, her face mature looking for one of the 
age as well. Her hair was long and flowing, reaching down to about her 
waist.

She took a step, slowly keeping a steady pace in her walk. Her boots, 
splashed only slightly with the water of the rain, gently stepped about 
the ground. Careful to avoid any unnecessary puddles, the tall teen 
titled her head. The girl brought a hand to her face, adjusting her 
glasses which slipped back and forth into place as she walked.

It was calming being out in the rain, for what ever reason she could 
find. The light rain pouring down, giving off an echoing beading sound 
from underneath her navy umbrella, continued its fall.

Even that being said, on that day however, the calming sensation she 
received from the rainwater was not her reason to be walking out in the 
cold summer air. She had had a lot on her mind. It mostly involved 
someone else though. It was for that reason she was out in the rain. A 
place to think. A place to sort out things... and she was expecting the 
someone on her thoughts as well.

Alone, she walked about the dreary city green.

----------

The brunette girl had taken a side trip to leave her aimlessly moving 
gait. Ever so carefully, she headed in direction of a well protected 
area of trees. Her vision suddenly became aware of a group of kids 
playing about in the water somewhat astray from her destination. The 
children were nearly soaking from head to toe, each happily accepting 
the fact they could catch a cold.

The young lady gave a small smile, a little unsure why the kids would 
submit themselves to completely drenching each other in water. &#39;Well, 
they might as well enjoy this. It&#39;s not like anyone at my age still is 
as carefree as that.&#39; The girl continued over to the wooded area.

A wet shine on her deep red boots and a mere frizz in her hair were the 
only signs to the girl&#39;s outing into the rainy weather. She held no 
complaint to remaining dry, though.

A dark haired girl out amongst the splashing and playing children seemed 
to take note of the girl and her umbrella passing by. She stood and 
trotted through the raining water.

&quot;Yomi!&quot; came the cry from behind the brunette. The girl in glasses only 
had a second to turn in response to the call. Almost immediately she was 
hit with the embrace of a soaking and damp person.

She screamed out a exclamation of surprise as the coldness of the other 
person&#39;s clothes squeezed against her. Yomi looked down to the short 
girl hugging her waist. &quot;Tomo? What in blazes are you doing playing out 
there?&quot; &#39;Go figure... Tomo is carefree like a child.&#39;

The teen pulled back, flashing a prize winning smile with her. &quot;I was 
walking around here to meet&#39;cha when the rain started. I figured I&#39;d 
already be soaked by the time you got here anyhow so I decided to go and 
play.&quot; She shrugged in her normal fashion.

Being released from the embrace of her close friend, Yomi was able to 
steady herself and hold her medium sized umbrella over her and Tomo. She 
took this as her chance to glance over her trouble causing friend.

The poor teen was soaking wet and seemed to only be in a light pullover 
jacket, a t-shirt and shorts. &quot;Tomo, gosh. What were you thinking?&quot; 
concernedly asked the taller girl. &quot;You&#39;ll get sick rampaging out around 
like this!&quot; She received a giggle.

&quot;Well, I was bored while waiting. So, anyway, what did you want to see 
me about?&quot; The taller of the two stifled a blush.

Glimpsing over her shoulder, Yomi pointed a thumb to where the line of 
trees were. Swallowing a nervous gulp, she strayed away from the topic 
&quot;I was hoping to find a spot that was dry to sit down at.&quot; She eyed over 
her friend once more. &quot;Come on. You may develop pneumonia if you stay 
out here any longer.&quot;

Grinning broadly, Tomo took the offer to go with her friend. The duo 
walked side by side until they reached the destination of Yomi&#39;s.

She looked around the base of one of the taller trees, hoping to find a 
patch of grass that was not covered by the rain. With luck on her side, 
she found a spot that was good for the two of them to sit down.

----------

Clicking the umbrella down, Yomi placed the object on her lap once she 
had settled down onto the green summer grass. Her dark haired friend 
gazed up at the thick branches of the large oak tree. It was enough to 
act as a mini shelter as long as the wind did not force the rain to blow 
into them. In front of the girls, a view of the hazy park provided a 
cute and serene setting, extremely pleasing to the eyes.

Tomo sat down next to her long time friend&#39;s right side, shoulders 
almost touching.

&quot;I really like the rain...&quot; Yomi mumbled mostly to herself, even though 
the girl at her side could hear her as well. She nodded.

The fair haired brunette sniffed the air and sighed. She loved it when 
it rained. It was a time when she could just simply relax, put all of 
her studies to the farthest reaches of her mind along with her worries. 
The calmness she experienced was enough to make her skip studying every 
day it rained.

The rain. How could she describe it? Normally associated with 
depression, the rain can hide tears. That&#39;s how many see it, and that 
reason is true. But the water can also start anew. It can begin an 
entirely new outlook on life. That was a real reason Yomi loved it so 
much too.

Her mind clouded peacefully and soon she subconsciously forgot where she 
was, what she was doing.

Minutes passed before an uneasy cough sounded, snapping Yomi out of her 
daydream. Suddenly, it all washed back to her why she was out in the 
park that day.

&#39;...Tomo.&#39;

The brunette bowed her head. Astonishingly, things seemed to get very 
restless for her.

&quot;So what did you want to talk with me about?&quot; came her dearest friend&#39;s 
query.

Yomi bit onto her bottom lip. Thoughts jumbled into her head. Everything 
seemed so distant from her at that very moment. She was never good with 
her emotions and at that time, she was being confronted by way too many. 
&#39;How can I say this? How can I tell her without her hating me...&#39;

It had been discovered by her, her feelings for the smaller girl that 
is, a couple months back. Sure, Yomi had always been fond of Tomo so to 
speak. She could never perceive why though. Maybe it was her over 
friendly personality, or her spirit or who knows? Yet only 5 full months 
before did the teen actually figure out what she was really feeling for 
her best friend.

The night prior to this day, she had had every detail covered. She knew 
what she was to say and how to say it. She went over each case scenario, 
every possible outcome to what she planned on saying.

That had no importance to the time being though. All her set thoughts 
had abandoned her as the real deal came into play. &#39;Tomo...&#39; she thought 
painfully. &#39;I don&#39;t want to hurt you but..I must say that... I...&#39;

----------

&quot;Come on Yomi-chan! What&#39;s the matter, an evil biting cat get your 
tongue?&quot; Yomi hurtfully looked up to the dark haired teen as Tomo 
giggled.

&#39;How can she take something this crucial in such a carefree way? Sure, 
she doesn&#39;t know I mean this to be serious, but still... oh. Tomo. Why 
do you do this to me?&#39; Yomi winced as her friend continued a light 
laugh.

The look on her best friend halted Tomo&#39;s giddy laughter though. &quot;Huh? 
...Yomi? What&#39;s the matter?&quot; She placed her hand gingerly on the 
troubled girl&#39;s right shoulder suddenly concerned with her friend&#39;s 
expression.

Flinching involuntarily at the contact, Yomi let out a sigh. Her face 
turned away from Tomo&#39;s, not wanting to bear to look at whom she was to 
admit her innermost feeling to. &#39;But I must.&#39;

&quot;Well... Tomo...&quot; She started slowly, picking out each of her words 
carefully. &quot;I... well... You know how we&#39;ve been... friends and all, 
since what seems forever? Well... I think... maybe... uh...&quot; Slowly, she 
eased her words to a stop. This wasn&#39;t working.

Her best friend sat there, quietly for once, with large eyes waiting to 
see what her friend had to speak about. Tomo smiled when Yomi seemed 
suck for words. &quot;It&#39;s alright, Yomi-chan. Keep going.&quot; She smiled 
broadly, the action giving a little bit of confidence back to the 
bespeckled teen.

&#39;Well... Alright Yomi. It&#39;s now or never.&#39;As Yomi let a smile out, ready 
to state her exclamation of love to her closest and dearest friend, a 
gust of wind propelled itself upon the duo.

Both girls cried out as sprays of water splashed against them, traveling 
thanks to the wind. Shielding her eyes, Yomi scrambled for her umbrella.

&quot;Yomiiiiiii!&quot; whined the girl beside her as the wind whipped back again 
sending another strong gust of water at the two.

With a grunt and trust of her arm, Yomi&#39;s umbrella opened up before the 
two seventeen year olds. Quickly, the girl with glass tucked up her legs 
to have her knees touching the trunk of the old oak tree. Tomo followed 
suit.

Steadying the umbrella out in front of them, Yomi breathed out in relief 
and briefly laughed. She could tell that they had only gotten a little 
bit wet due to the spray of rain water. Her clothing felt damp, but not 
to a great extent and her hair was quite dry. Absorbed in checking her 
clothing, the brunette was startled when she felt Tomo drop her head 
onto her shoulder. She felt the smaller girl shiver and asked &quot;Are you 
okay?&quot;

Tomo nodded while scooting closer. &quot;Yeah, but the damn rain is still 
hitting my back.&quot; Another blow of the wind sent more rain streaming at 
them. Tomo shuddered again when she felt the cool water hit her already 
damp light jacket.

----------

&quot;Gah, Tomo!&quot; cried out Yomi as she adjusted the umbrella to cover her 
friend, leaving her back slightly in the line of the rain. The water was 
really cold and she bit her lip while growling at it. Why didn&#39;t she 
bring a larger umbrella?

Then the shorter haired teen protested. &quot;Now you are gonna get wet. 
Here.&quot; Without a hesitation, Tomo crawled forward and sat on top of 
Yomi&#39;s bent legs, hunching her back slightly to stay within the 
protection of the umbrella. The sudden closeness of their bodies made 
Yomi&#39;s cheeks flare up faster than a wildfire. She was lucky that Tomo 
had rested her head over her left shoulder. Otherwise she&#39;d have a 
crimson face to vouch for.

At long last the umbrella safely covered each girl equally. To achieve 
this result, Yomi had her left hand holding the umbrella pole while her 
right arm was around her friend&#39;s waist to keep her steady. Her right 
shoulder was pressed against the tree. The winds were still pretty 
strong and the duo would hear the splattering of the storm water echoing 
behind their umbrella shield.

&quot;Well, that was a sure strike of bad luck,&quot; commented Tomo in hopes of 
lightening the mood. The girl she had been sitting on un-stiffened and 
relaxed back against the tree once hearing her friend&#39;s sentence.

&quot;You could say that again...&quot; mumbled the taller teen in annoyance.

Tomo spoke nonchalantly. &quot;Well, it was your fault.&quot;

The long haired teen furrowed her brows in vexation. &quot;Oh? And how is 
that?&quot;

&quot;You wanted to come here in the first place.&quot;

Yomi growled. &quot;But it&#39;s not my fault that this drizzle turned into an 
awful downpour.&quot;

Tilting her head a little to one side, Tomo continued, a smug look 
dawning on her facial features. &quot;Or was it?&quot;

Letting out an exasperating sigh, Yomi frowned. &quot;Oh, so now I am some 
kind of witch. Even if I could control the weather, why would I want 
this?&quot; She wanted to bite her tongue. There she was, sitting so close to 
the one person she cherished more than anything, and she was still 
saying this in spite of her feelings. &#39;Argh. Just shut it now Koyomi!&#39; 
she scolded to herself.

A fierce zephyr collided into the umbrella sending a load of water with 
it. A couple of drops splashed over and onto the upperclassmen heads.

&quot;Oh Yomi, you know you like spending time with me.&quot; She turned her head 
to the other side, it still resting upon Yomi&#39;s shoulder, only this time 
facing in towards the other girl&#39;s hair.

The brunette&#39;s cheeks flared. Biting her tongue to keep from an 
embarrassing stutter, Yomi&#39;s mind went into overdrive. &#39;Wait. Does that 
means she knows...? Is she okay with this... How I feel...?&#39; While 
trying to think of a suitable response, her friend continued on.

&quot;I mean, for whatever reason, you are my best friend.&quot; Yomi&#39;s eyes 
widened. Something inside her felt a hard stab with that sentence. &quot;It&#39;d 
be only natural you&#39;d want to be with me .I mean come on, it is me we 
are talking about.&quot;

----------

&#39;She... still thinks of me... as only a friend...&#39; A sting was felt in 
her eye, but the tall girl fought back against that which she knew would 
cause tears. She should have known. &#39;Friend...&#39; She repeated the word 
over and over to herself hoping that maybe she could psych herself out. 
Maybe even rid her of her this feeling once and for all. Each time, 
however, just brought more pain into her.

Eventually, she found herself just barely able to keep back a sob.

There was silence, except for the occasionally blasts of rain colliding 
with the umbrella. Tomo didn&#39;t like this and began to ponder over what 
could make Yomi so quiet. She felt the girl she sat upon quiver. A 
couple of seconds later, she felt the same motion again. It was light, 
but being so pressed up to her friend made it easier to feel.

&quot;Yomi?&quot; asked the normally overly hyper girl cautiously, not sure what 
was wrong. Her head was just beneath Yomi&#39;s ear so the other girl&#39;s face 
was still out of view.

&quot;Hey Tomo,&quot; Yomi began as steadily as she could. She couldn&#39;t handle 
everything that was within her. She had to say it. &quot;Do you know why I 
like the rain...?&quot;

Still surprised by the sudden mood change of her friend, Tomo simply 
shook her head. Then she felt a droplet on her cheek. Yet the rain had 
not been blown in that time. Was that... Yomi? Blinking, Tomo sat up as 
best she could to face her friend.

Even hidden behind her friend&#39;s glasses, Tomo could see the puffiness of 
Yomi&#39;s eyes. A trail left from a tear was shimmering on her cheek even 
in the muffled light. &quot;Hey, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; sincerely wondered Tomo, a 
frown formed by her lips.

Not meeting eye contact, Yomi simply continued what she had already 
begun to say.&quot;...It&#39;s because no matter what happens, it always can 
disguise tears... for better or for worse...&quot;

At that, Tomo became nervous. Since when did her Yomi cry? Yomi never 
cries. Never! Not sure about anything at that moment, Tomo leaped 
forward and tightly embraced her friend just as another spout of rain 
connected with the outward umbrella. &quot;Why are you crying? I really don&#39;t 
like this, Yomi.&quot; She snuggled her face into her friend&#39;s shoulder and 
Yomi nearly moved herself away, but fought back that urge. &quot;You&#39;re my 
best friend, Yomi-chan!&quot;

There it was again. Yomi bit her inner cheek as she felt the painful 
stab in her chest again. &#39;That&#39;s it. I can&#39;t keep this up.&#39;

&quot;Tomo, that&#39;s just the problem,&quot; was what she was able to say without 
stuttering. &quot;Can&#39;t you see?&quot; At that point, the girl in her lap took it 
as her time to pull away to meet Yomi&#39;s eyes head on. The shorter girl&#39;s 
eyes held confusion. &quot;Tomo, don&#39;t you see that I can&#39;t be friends with 
you?&quot;

A blink was all Yomi got in response. &quot;You are definitely not feeling 
well, Yomi-chan,&quot; came the remark from the girl before her just as 
another gust of wind went swooping through.

----------

&quot;Tomo, no. You don&#39;t get it!&quot; desperately cried the frustrated teen as 
her eyes let two more tears go down her cheeks. Her eye contact fell 
once again, searching for anything to make this easier, more comforting 
to say. There was nothing within the proximity that she was sitting 
though that could do that, except for one. Dragging her gaze back up, 
Yomi met Tomo&#39;s look.

The girl before her tilted her head in an innocent manner. &quot;What don&#39;t I 
get? You can say it if it&#39;ll make you feel better, cause I&#39;m beginning 
to miss the old bitchy you.&quot; She smiled that Tomo-rific smile, only 
making her friend more agitated.

Taking in a deep breath, Yomi focused her thoughts. &quot;Okay, Tomo... I 
can&#39;t think of you as my friend anymore...&quot;

Ready to open her mouth to make another comment, Yomi stopped Tomo by 
quickly finishing her started sentence.

&quot;...because, you&#39;re more than a friend to me.. much more...&quot; What she 
had thought she said pretty clear and boldly, Yomi found to be almost as 
quiet as a whisper, but none the less sincere.

Shaking her head, the dark haired girl pried, a serious look dawning on 
her features. &quot;...what did you say?&quot;

More tears spouted from the brunette&#39;s eyes. She was too confused. No 
matter what happened, no matter how much courage she could muster, it 
never followed through. And Tomo&#39;s reaction was not that of which she 
had expected. She was in disbelief of Yomi, that was it. &quot;I-I&#39;m sorry... 
Tomo.&quot; Not knowing what else to say, she just continued her rambling 
apologies. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. So sorry...&quot;

&quot;What are you sorry for?&quot; Yomi stole a glance at her friend&#39;s face. &quot;You 
are so confusing. Maybe if you repeat what you had said before, I could 
actually hear you and make heads or tails of this whole thing.&quot;

She didn&#39;t hear? Go figure. Yomi sighed in annoyance at herself. She was 
her own problem. The whole thing could be settled by now if only she had 
the courage to confess to Tomo. Her saddened eyes drew Tomo&#39;s face close 
to hers.

&quot;Yomi, please. If this bothers you so much, I want to know.&quot;

Choking back a sob, which she was not sure came from that time, the 
brunette stated &quot;I-I don&#39;t want... you t-to hate me...&quot;

Playfully sticking out her tongue, Tomo giggled. &quot;I&#39;d never hate you. 
Maybe on occasion I&#39;d dislike you, but I&#39;d never hate you Yomi.&quot; For a 
rare moment, Tomo closed her eyes and smiled a sincere smile. &quot;You mean 
too much to me to hate you.&quot;

A strong gust of wind hit the umbrella once more, eliciting a loud 
echoing sound of water.

During that moment, Yomi lost all of her self control and wrapped her 
arms tightly around the other form. Her face burrowed into Tomo&#39;s hair 
as she sobbed in thankfulness for her closest friend. The more cheery 
girl hugged back, her hands resting on the other teen&#39;s shoulder blades.

Tomo pulled back slowly to meet her face with Yomi&#39;s once again, her 
hands remaining behind her friend&#39;s shoulders. &quot;I really want to hear. 
Now come on...&quot;

----------

Yomi starred back to her friend who was maybe 4 inches from herself, a 
smile appearing on her mouth at her friend&#39;s smile. Her red eyes 
softened behind her rounded glasses. &quot;Tomo, what I want to say is...&quot;

She felt a sudden wave of courage surge through her staring deep into 
Tomo&#39;s friendly eyes, and it felt so good. This was it &quot;...I love you... 
More than you would ever believe. I&#39;m in love with you.&quot;

At that moment, ignoring her friend&#39;s complete change of expression, 
Yomi threw caution to the wind and leaned in to close the gap of inches 
between their faces. Unshed tears gathered in her eyes as alleviation 
took hold of her, finally feeling free of her emotions. She felt the 
other girl&#39;s soft lips against her own as she pressed herself to the 
other girl. Yomi could feel the warmth, that being around Tomo always 
made her feel, scorch through her body at that moment.

Another whirl of wind collided powerfully into the umbrella, but it was 
nothing but background noise.

Finally, after what seemed like a century yet was but a mere 6 seconds, 
Yomi pulled back. Her eyes grew anxious right away as she saw the look 
of astonishment sent back to her. The tall girl felt immense guilt pile 
up within her. &#39;Oh great Kami... Tomo... What have I done?&#39;

&quot;I&#39;m s-so s-sorry Tomo...&quot; said Yomi while bowing her head in shame 
while a round of sobs over took her. Half of her was hoping that maybe, 
just maybe, Tomo would call out that it was okay, that she loved her 
back and kiss her right back. The other half, her stronger half, was 
expecting nothing less than a slap in the face and utter words of 
rejection.

What she didn&#39;t expect was to hear Tomo break out into hysteric sobs.

Concernedly turning up to the other girl, Yomi could not read anything 
on her face. She felt the pang of guilt hit her again like a fist in the 
gut as she gathered the small girl into her arms. Soothingly, she 
stroked Tomo&#39;s back, wanting to speak consoling words, yet not trusting 
her own cracked voice.

&quot;Yomi... Yo..mi...&quot; sobbed the dark haired seventeen year old onto 
Yomi&#39;s chest. She sniffled loudly and exhaled, it not doing much to 
steady her breath.

She was helpless. She had no clue what to do. All Yomi knew was that 
Tomo was there and upset. It was her fault as well! That oh so familiar 
sting returned to her optics at those thoughts. She let the tears go 
down her cheeks. &#39;Why am I crying? Tomo is upset.&#39; Gently she shook her 
head. &#39;I shouldn&#39;t be crying. I should be helping her!&#39;

With that set thought, Yomi pulled away, steadying the tearful girl in 
front of her. Tomo would not keep her half lidded gaze anywhere but 
Yomi&#39;s face. It struck Yomi deeply just seeing the tears cascading down 
the opposite girl&#39;s face.

Carefully, she brought a hand to Tomo&#39;s cheek and brushed away a trail 
of tears with her thumb. Forcing a smile, Yomi laughed into a sob. &quot;Now, 
don&#39;t go crying on me Tomo.&quot; She brushed away another tear line, leaning 
her palms to Tomo&#39;s delicate face.

----------

The girl, still positioned on her lap, slowed her tears fairly easily 
once feeling Yomi&#39;s hands rest on both of her cheeks.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to.. upset you...&quot; whimpered the slightly 
wiser girl. &quot;Now.. I know what you had said before... but I still... 
will understand...&quot; She swallowed the lump forming in her throat. &quot;...if 
you hate me now... but I had to.. tell you...&quot;

There was an awkward silence in which only the rain on the protecting 
umbrella and the duo&#39;s breathing could be heard.

Then, out of nowhere, Tomo let out a chuckle. It was quite spontaneous 
as she was accustomed to doing on many an occasion. The chuckle grew 
louder and more merry but the second. Pretty soon, she appeared as happy 
as her normal self. This all just left Yomi in the haze.

&quot;Oh, Yomi. As I said, I&#39;d never ever hate you.&quot; Her overly cheerful 
smile could have fooled anyone into believing that she wasn&#39;t just 
crying. Anyone but Yomi, who seemed quite taken back. &quot;Quite the 
contrary actually.&quot;

&quot;Wha...?&quot; was all she could muster out of her sheer confusion.

The next moment came so swiftly, it made Yomi jump a tiny bit. Tomo 
leaned her forehead against Yomi&#39;s, looking up to her glasses covered 
eyes. A blush made its way onto both parties&#39; cheeks. &quot;I never thought 
I&#39;d get to say this to you... but I love you too, Yomi.&quot; In the blink of 
an eye, their lips connected again and Yomi wasn&#39;t sure if she should 
still be shocked or let the feeling take her over. She went with the 
second choice as she melted into Tomo&#39;s lips.

The wind on the other side of the sheltering umbrella let up slightly, 
but it went by unnoticed by the two girls behind it.

Tomo&#39;s arms had snaked around Yomi&#39;s neck, pulling the other girl in 
closer. Yomi smiled into the kiss, totally unaware of anything else at 
that moment. And once again, the girls pulled back, both panting a 
little. Tomo went back to resting her head on the taller girl&#39;s 
shoulder, a great satisfied grin on her face.

Minutes passed as the two sat there embracing. It was very quiet. Yomi 
decided to take a chance and moved the umbrella ever so slightly. The 
rain was still coming down, but the wind was virtually gone. The windy 
storm had turned back into a fair summer shower. She grinned.

Tomo made a groan when Yomi tried to move. &quot;Come on, Tomo. The rain is 
letting up for a while.&quot; Tomo sat back up on her own, her eyes looking 
on the border between awake and asleep.

She yawned and then complained in her childish fashion. &quot;But you were so 
comfy...&quot;

The opposite girl smiled and her cheeks tinted pink. Yomi then moved the 
umbrella and gave Tomo some leeway to stand up. Once the short girl 
stood, Yomi was helped up. &quot;Hey, let&#39;s get going. You&#39;re clothing is 
still damp. I don&#39;t want to catch a cold from you.&quot;

----------

&quot;With your luck you don&#39;t need me for that.&quot; Tomo received a playful 
punch in the arm at her remark. Then very randomly the smaller teen 
begged Yomi to let her hold the umbrella, which resulted in an odd look 
from the other woman. &quot;Can I can I can I?&quot;

Giving an impassive face, Yomi raised her eyebrows as Tomo eyed the 
umbrella grasped in her right hand.&quot;I seem to remember you having bad 
experiences with any umbrella you use. And I&#39;m sure there will be more 
to come.&quot;

Smiling sweetly, Tomo complied. &quot;Okay. You can hold it.&quot; She then looped 
her left arm under Yomi&#39;s, and placed her hand over top of her 
girlfriend&#39;s hand holding the umbrella base. &quot;I&#39;ll just hold your hand 
then.&quot;

Trying to keep a composure of a sort, Yomi shrugged. Yet she smiled 
broadly inwardly. They started to walk off in the direction of the park 
exit. Once stepping out from the cover of the foliage, the rain began 
pounding down onto the umbrella. The girls just happily walked through 
the near completely empty park.

A couple of minutes flew by as they neared the exit to the city green. 
&quot;I&#39;m just still so glad you told me Tomo. I never would have thought...&quot; 
Yomi said sheepishly.

&quot;Haha. How could not, Yomi-chan. Hasn&#39;t it been obvious since Freshman 
year?&quot; Tomo hugged her love&#39;s arm closely and laughed. Blushing, Yomi 
giggled nervously while diverting her gaze. &quot;Eh, maybe it wasn&#39;t exactly 
obvious then.&quot;

&quot;You think? I think you&#39;re too dense most of the time.&quot; Yomi then had a 
question that she had the urge to ask. &quot;Why were you crying then Tomo? 
After I confessed?&quot;

The tinier teen sighed. &quot;I was so happy, but you surprised me.. Like a 
whole bunch!&quot; Then she smirked. &quot;Oh, and now who is the dense one here?&quot; 
Yomi nudged Tomo in a teasing manner.

Smiling in a way she never thought possible, Yomi lost her stare to the 
water dripping down off of the umbrella. &#39;I&#39;ve always loved the rain for 
many reasons... But I think I&#39;ve found an even better reason.&#39; Tomo&#39;s 
head fell onto her taller girlfriend&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;I love you, Koyomi.&quot;

&quot;And I love you, Tomo-chan.&quot;

The two giggled joyfully for no particular cause and made there way out 
of the park.

Together.

A.N.: Written over the past three sleepless nights of mine. (Twitch) It 
was originally a one page oneshot, but then it got longer and turned 
into eleven (Twitch) I do like this pairing. Number one out of all my 
fave Azu pairings. And the umbrella idea came from back when my friends 
and I were kids. Umbrellas do make awesome shields. lol So I used that 
idea and stuck in some romance.

I didn&#39;t want this to be solid drama, so hopefully it was kinda fluffy. 
Me likes the fluff. Love the fluff people. Love it! oo;
