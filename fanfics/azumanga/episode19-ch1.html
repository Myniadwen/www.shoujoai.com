<h2>a <a href="../azumanga/index.html">Azumanga Daioh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kamehameha.html">Kamehameha</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Notes: Hello! My first fan fiction in the Azumanga section! I 
was hoping to make a Directors Cut because for some odd reason, that 
episode made me write something like this&#133; For those who haven&#39;t seen 
the episode, this maybe be a spoiler, so don&#39;t read it unless you want 
to. The translations are done by NLA, Ishin &amp; A-F Fansubs. Enjoy!

-----

Good evening, Tanaka Nakuro also known as Naku here! Ogino Michiru, also 
known as Micchii here! Naku and Micchii&#39;s The Young Heartthrob Talk 
Show!

The noise was coming out of Koyomi&#39;s room. She was studying for the test 
the next day and turned the radio on to keep her company as she did her 
studying questions. Her royal blue room was almost entirely dark except 
for the studying lamp that was lit so she could easily see what she was 
reading and writing. 

By the way, Micchii, did you see the cherry blossoms around town? They 
bloomed early this year. I saw, I saw! The cherry tree in the park next 
to our studio is already in full bloom!

Suddenly, there was a light tap on the window and the visitor pulled the 
window open. There stood Tomo letting out a friendly &quot;Yo!&quot;

Yomi wasn&#39;t extremely surprised. Tomo would usually unexpectedly come 
over to her house once in a while to bug her, copy her homework or just 
lay around to keep her company. &quot;You&#39;re here&#133;&quot;

&quot;Yeah&quot; Tomo agreed as she invited herself in. She took off her slippers 
near the entrance of the window and slipped inside. She closed the 
window behind her and laid on Yomi&#39;s bed. Tomo casually reached under 
the bed and pulled out a ReTass magazine and started to look through it.

Cherry blossom petals fall, right? I love cherry blossoms, but isn&#39;t it 
sad how such pure things have to scatter?

&quot;I&#39;m not going to keep you company.&quot; Yomi said as she continued working 
on her math questions.

&quot;I don&#39;t care.&quot; She replied and flipped through more pages until she let 
out a yawn.

That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like to go flower watching that much. Well, I 
understand how you feel but&#133;

&quot;Hey, wasn&#39;t that yawn kinda good?&quot; Tomo grinned. She doesn&#39;t give up 
too often, even if she got in trouble for practicing yawning and falling 
asleep. At least she wasn&#39;t the only one late for Kurosawa&#39;s class.

The older girl sweat dropped. &quot;You&#39;re still at it?&quot; Tomo never seems to 
amaze me.

&quot;Well, of course. I don&#39;t want to lose to Osaka! I&#39;m trying to compete 
against her too!!!&quot; Tomo said as she let out a peace sign. &quot;Yes! First 
Sakaki, then Chiyo-suke and now Osaka-&quot;

Yomi let out a yawn and continued working on her answer. Tomo gazed at 
her and immediately stopped talking.

After realizing the silence given to her by one of the loudest kids in 
the country, Koyomi glanced at Tomo and caught the smaller girl gaping 
at her. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;

Tomo pointed at her and screamed. &quot;SUGOI!!! What great power!!!&quot;

&quot;Great power?&quot; Yomi asked.

&quot;The power of that yawn! It was amazing&#133; Better than Osaka&#39;s&quot;

&quot;And how is that so?&quot; Tomo really had a weird mind&#133;

&quot;Because you look cute with that yawn.&quot; Tomo said with a slight amount 
of sincerity. &quot;It stops you from looking all grown up and stuff.&quot;

A loud silence occurred until the radio spoke up.

And this is from a person who goes by the name of &quot;Daifuku Chocolate&quot; 
Quite a &quot;sweet&quot; name and the Daifuku Chocolate&#39;s request is Asakawa 
Yuu&#39;s &quot;Parachute with a Girl&#39;s Heart&quot;! Oh, I love this song!

Yomi glanced over at the radio and went back to finishing her question.

&quot;By the way&quot; Tomo had risen from her current state and sat with her back 
against the wall.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Today, Kagura said that we had a lot of free time didn&#39;t she? I wonder 
what she meant by that.&quot;

Yomi turned her chair and faced Tomo, &quot;Oh, that? I guess it&#39;s true. 
Whether it&#39;s with clubs or with school, whenever we try really hard at 
something, we start to get impatient with it&quot;

Tomo looked up and thought.

&quot;Since we don&#39;t have anything to put our minds to, it seems like we have 
time to spare because we&#39;re not rushing with things. But I&#39;m a little 
jealous of people who can focus their effort on a single thing&quot; Yomi 
turned and continued writing.

Tomo looked at her and curled up, head resting on her knees and her arms 
keeping her knees pulled against her. She was deep in thought, which was 
surprising since usually Tomo thinks before she acts.

&quot;Hey, why didn&#39;t I join any clubs?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re thinking of this now?&quot;

&quot;Oh well&quot; Tomo said as she leaned to the side and comfortably sprawled 
herself across the bed.

So&#133; Sacchi-kun from the Saitama prefecture, I know getting dumped is 
difficult, but you&#39;re not the only one with this problem. That&#39;s right, 
you have no idea how many times Nakuro was dumped. That&#39;s right! I got 
dumped repeatedly while I was in school and the nickname I got 
was&quot;Emperor of Unrequited Love&quot;&#133; Hey, why are you making me say this!? 
Hahaha&#133; Sorry!

Tomo laughed along with Micchii. &quot;That&#39;s sooo stupid! I wonder how the 
people who send in the letters to those people feel.&quot; Tomo grinned.

And the next letter is from someone with the penname &quot;Crying Diet Girl.&quot; 
I remember her.

Yomi looked up and glanced at the radio.

This is the girl that&#39;s tried to lose weight MANY different ways. The 
male voice on the radio laughed.

She continued staring at the radio and concentrated on what they were 
saying. Tomo was paying attention as well.

She categorizes each diet plan. Don&#39;t laugh at her! It&#39;s a huge problem 
for girls. Yeah&#133; I shouldn&#39;t laugh&#133; anyway&#133;

Both teenagers listened intently on the radio show that was coming from 
the radio machine.

Naku and Micchii&#133; please listen to us. I tried a non-granular diet. 
Huh?! A non-granular diet?

&quot;Non-granular diet? Isn&#39;t that what you did last month and failed 
horribly at?&quot; Tomo asked.

Yomi flinched at that comment. She hated it when Tomo was catching on to 
her secrets.

Tomo gave a triumphant grin. &quot;Huh? Could it be?&quot;

Yomi turned her head towards Tomo in embarrassment and quickly looked 
away from the annoying student.

&quot;Ah! I&#39;m right! Man, isn&#39;t that embarrassing?&quot; Tomo teased loudly. She 
suddenly waved her arms in the air indicating in a strange way about how 
funny and embarrassed Yomi must be.

&quot;You send letters to that show?&quot; Tomo suddenly jumped on Yomi&#39;s bed and 
yelled, &quot;Yomi, you&#39;re so embarrassing!&quot;

Tomo laughed. &quot;&#39;Crying Diet Girl&#39;, huh?!&quot; The smaller girl laughed so 
much, tears poured out of her eyes from the hilarious comment.

&quot;Shut up! Shut up!&quot; Yomi screamed as she clenched her fist.

&quot;That&#39;s sooo sad!&quot; She continued to laugh.

The first time I had rice after three days, it tasted sooo good. Since 
it was so good, I even had seconds! The hosts of the show continued to 
laugh. And when I weighed myself the next day, I weighed more than I did 
three days before. Well, of course! The biggest enemy to that 
non-granular diet is your mother&#39;s cooking!

Yomi nodded. It was true; every diet is vulnerable to end due to 
homemade cooking.

The other teen however, continued to laugh as tears poured out of her 
eyes. Yomi turned around screamed, &quot;Don&#39;t laugh!&quot;

Tomo tried to suppress her laugh. &quot;It&#39;s like it was meant to be laughed 
at!&quot; She couldn&#39;t hold it and continued laughing.

&quot;It pisses me off if you laugh before they say anything funny.&quot; Yomi 
stated.

It sure is difficult to eat curry without rice.

Yomi focused her attention back to the radio broadcast.

Too bad! &quot;Crying Diet Girl&quot;, when you decide to go on another diet, send 
us a letter!

&quot;Sure!&quot; Yomi agreed.

I&#39;ll be cheering you on!

&quot;I&#39;ll try my best!&quot; Yomi said.

Meanwhile, Tomo was rolling on the bed, laughing her ass off in Yomi&#39;s 
last comment. &quot;Huh!? You&#39;re talking to the radio!&quot;

Yomi stood up and yelled, &quot;Shut up!&quot;

&quot;C&#39;mon, Crying Diet Girl!&quot; Tomo continued to tease.

&quot;You got a problem with that?&quot; Yomi said as Tomo leaped off the bed and 
chased her around the small room.

&quot;Well, no, but it&#39;s just too funny!&quot; Tomo giggled.

&quot;Well, if that was you, you wouldn&#39;t be laughing!&quot; Yomi yelled.

&quot;Yes&#133; But if that WAS me, I wouldn&#39;t be sending letters to that radio 
program about my problems.&quot; Tomo grinned. &quot;Plus, I&#39;m just way too sexy 
to have that problem happen to me!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re really annoying, you know that?&quot; Yomi asked Tomo.

&quot;Only because you&#39;ve corrupted me that way, Koyomi-kun.&quot; Tomo teased.

&quot;As if! You&#39;re the one that&#39;s manipulating and corrupting!&quot; Yomi yelled 
and turned off the radio.

Tomo shrugged, &quot;Nope, it&#39;s you because you&#39;re always acting like a smart 
ass and make everyone believe and stuff because you&#39;re sooo 
intellectual! It makes me pissed off.&quot;

Yomi clenched her fist. &quot;Fine, if you&#39;re going to make fun of me and 
stuff, GET OUT!&quot;

&quot;No way! I&#39;m your guest so you have to keep me here until I say so.&quot; 
Tomo said as she flopped on the bed and read the magazine.

Yomi continued to stand there, glaring at the smaller teen. &quot;Well, I&#39;m 
your host so you have to leave when I say so.&quot;

&quot;Damn you, I ain&#39;t leaving!&quot; The smaller girl whined.

&quot;And why not?&quot; Yomi asked.

&quot;Because we&#39;re best buddies and us buddies gotta stick together like jam 
and salsa!&quot;

The taller girl sweatdropped. &quot;Jam and salsa don&#39;t go along&#133;&quot;

&quot;Oh&#133; I knew that!&quot; Tomo smiled smugly. &quot;We&#39;re still buddies right?&quot;

Yomi fought back. &quot;As if! You&#39;ve never considered me as a friend, only a 
toy to make fun of and piss off every day!&quot;

&quot;Well, now you know we&#39;re friends, got that? Plus, haven&#39;t you heard the 
saying those who play together stay together. I always thought of that 
to be a dirty joke, but I&#39;m starting to understand it now.&quot; She said as 
she placed a finger on her chin.

&quot;I&#39;m ignoring you now.&quot; Yomi said as she sat down and rested her head on 
the desk.

&quot;Have you ever considered me as a friend?&quot; Tomo asked, with a bit of 
innocence in her tone.

Yomi looked up, surprised. &quot;In some occasions, yes. In other occasions, 
no.&quot;

&quot;So, what are those no occasions?&quot;

Yomi glanced over to her friend. &quot;Times when you piss me off, times when 
I&#39;ve just about had enough of you and times when-&quot;

&quot;You thought of me more than just a friend?&quot; Tomo asked.

&quot;Yes- I mean no!&quot; Yomi blushed. &quot;What gave you that suspicion?&quot;

Tomo grinned, &quot;Because I know you, you&#39;ve run away from a lot of your 
fears of embarrassment. What I&#39;m trying to say is that you try too hard 
and never get what you want done. So, you always run away from those 
problems.&quot; The concerned voice was coming from the one person that would 
always be worry free.

&quot;And you&#39;re point in being?&quot; Yomi asked. This was just too bizarre to 
see Tomo talk in such an intellectual way.

&quot;You&#39;ve tried to run away from me many times.&quot;

&quot;And?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re trying to deny the fact that you can&#39;t resist me!&quot; Tomo smirked.

Yomi sighed. &quot;Look, I only like you as a friend. The only reason why 
I&#39;ve been trying to get away from you is because-&quot;

Tomo interrupted. &quot;You think I&#39;m annoying?&quot;

&quot;Yes&quot; was the reply.

Tomo grinned, &quot;Great! Now I can be more annoying from now on!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know why you spend so much time and energy pissing people off.&quot; 
Yomi commented. &quot;I mean, rather than wasting it on making people 
annoyed, every try using that energy for something useful?&quot;

&quot;Like ICPO?&quot; Tomo asked.

&quot;No&#133; You can use that energy trying to think about tomorrow&#39;s English 
exam.&quot; She picked up her pencil and finished the question.

&quot;But I don&#39;t wanna study for no dumb English exam&#133;&quot; The hyperactive one 
whined.

Yomi glanced at her and put down the pencil. &quot;Fine, it&#39;s your life, not 
mine.&quot;

&quot;Okay! How about I use my energy for something else&#133;&quot; Tomo said as she 
crawled over to the side of the bed and flopped back down, closer to 
Yomi.

&quot;I have no suggestions.&quot; She closed her books. She turned off the light 
and walked towards her window, staring outside into the night sky.

&quot;I know! I know how I can use my extra energy for!&quot; Tomo shouted 
excitedly.

&quot;And what would that be?&quot;

A light tap on her shoulder made Yomi turn around as her lips were met 
by Tomo&#39;s. Her eyes widened and she pulled back quickly.

&quot;W-What are you doing!?&quot; Yomi&#39;s face became flushed with embarrassment.

Tomo smiled. &quot;Aren&#39;t you happy? I&#39;m using my extra energy to not piss 
someone off. Glad?&quot;

&quot;G-Glad?!&quot; Yomi yelled. &quot;Why would I be glad because of the fact that 
you just kissed me!?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm&#133; Let&#39;s see&#133; Maybe it&#39;s because of the fact that you&#39;re too shy to 
say anything and always try to run away from me because you&#39;re afraid I 
might not feel the same way, is the reason why I did that. Thoughtful 
ain&#39;t I?&quot; Tomo smirked.

&quot;Thoughtful my ass! I&#39;m not shy! It&#39;s just that-&quot; Yomi couldn&#39;t think of 
a reason to counter Tomo&#39;s statement. Instead she walked towards her bed 
and sat down. Tomo sat down as well, waiting for Yomi to finish her 
sentence.

&quot;Maybe you&#39;re right. I can&#39;t stop running away from you. The truth is, I 
like you and all those time you&#39;ve spent with me, I was afraid you&#39;d 
stop being my friend because I&#133; I like you a lot. Ever since the 
beginning, you&#39;ve stuck by my side. I&#39;ve only realized it during my 
junior high years and tried to deny my feelings for you. I came to this 
high school because I thought you wouldn&#39;t be able to get in. That would 
be easier for me to start over and forget about you. It&#39;s not like I 
doubted you that you couldn&#39;t make it, it&#39;s just that I though you were 
far better off relaxed and care-free to even be concerned about that. 
But I was wrong. The second you told me you were accepted here, I was 
confused. Confused if I should feel happy, or even more hurt to suppress 
my true intentions. My true feelings. I don&#39;t know what I should say 
now, but I love you Tomo.&quot; Yomi said as she embraced Tomo.

&quot;I love you too Yomi. I came to this school to be with you. Even if 
cracking the books was a lot harder than I thought it would be. Being 
with you makes my life more fun, less empty and a lot happier. Thanks 
for being there for me.&quot; Tomo confessed.

Yomi gave her a puzzled look. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t that be my line? You&#39;re the one 
that&#39;s always been there for me.&quot;

&quot;Ah whatever&#133; we&#39;ll always be there for each other. Got that?&quot; Tomo 
smiled.

Yomi nodded. &quot;Agreed. No matter what happens, we&#39;ll always be there for 
each other.&quot; She leaned over to Tomo and shared a kiss.

&quot;I love you Yomi.&quot;

&quot;I love you too.&quot; Yomi let out a yawn before collapsing on to her bed, 
tiredly.

&quot;Wow! That was a great yawn! The best yawn I&#39;ve seen all day&#133; You gotta 
teacher me how to yawn like that&#133;&quot; Tomo commented before she closed her 
eyes and fell asleep.

&quot;You&#39;re still compulsively obsessed about that&#133;&quot; was all Yomi could say 
before she collapsed into a deep slumber with Tomo lying in her arms.

-----

Another sunny day as gym class occurred. A whistle was being blown, 
indicating that it was time for them to stop talking and listen to 
Kurosawa sensei.

Kagura stepped up and managed to be the first to leap over the vaulting 
horse. She completed it successfully.

&quot;Why do we get so sleepy in the spring?&quot; Tomo whined. Yomi glanced at 
her.

Another whistle was blown as Chiyo leaped but landed on the vaulting 
horse.

&quot;It&#39;s because you stayed up late.&quot; Yomi stated.

&quot;At least I wasn&#39;t the only one that was staying up late.&quot; Tomo winked.

&quot;It was you&#39;re fault that I had to. If you didn&#39;t come over, you 
wouldn&#39;t be tired and neither would I.&quot; Yomi said as she closed her 
eyes, tiredly.

Tomo grinned. &quot;Yes, but you see Koyomi, if I didn&#39;t have come, you would 
have still been deny my feelings for me!&quot;

&quot;Shut up. That&#39;s enough from you.&quot; Yomi blushed.

The whistle was blown again. Osaka&#39;s attempt included crashing into the 
equipment instead of leaping over it.

&quot;Osaka! Get your act together! Geez&#133;&quot; Kurosawa yelled as she let out a 
yawn.

Tomo gasped in amazement. &quot;Whoa! Bravo! That&#39;s an awesome yawn!&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Kurosawa turned her head towards the two.

Tomo smiled. &quot;That&#39;s the best yawn I&#39;ve seen all week!&quot;

&quot;Hey! What happened to my yawn?&quot; Yomi asked.

&quot;Oh yeah, yours was good&#133; Sensei! You gotta teach me that one!&quot; Tomo 
begged the teacher.

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re hitting on the teacher too!!!&quot;

&quot;And why wouldn&#39;t I be? Are you jealous?&quot; Tomo teased and hung her arm 
around Yomi&#39;s neck.

&quot;Oh shut up.&quot;

-----

Well, how was it? Good? Bad? I&#39;d appreciate it if I hear from your 
comments. Perhaps I should write another director&#39;s cut for a 
Yukari/Nyamo fanfiction&#133; Well, if you think it&#39;s a good idea, leave it 
in your review. Thanks for reading!
