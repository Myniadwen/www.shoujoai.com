Chapter Number Dix, for those of you who speak any french.

The Fragile Promise

&quot;Ugh...&quot; Yomi tossed and turned a bit in the bed before finally deciding 
to open her eyes. After a moment, she was able to fixate her gaze upon 
the clock. Ten past Ten. Had she really slept that long? She yawned as 
she sat up, adjusting her school girl uniform that she had been too lazy 
to change out of. &quot;What a dream, eh Tomo?&quot; Yomi looked to her side, but 
there was no Tomo there. Yomi thought for a moment, and then, it all 
came back to her. &quot;Oh, SHIT!&quot; She was downstairs immediately, and her 
fears were realized.

On the floor in front of the TV, there lay Tomo, not moving, and face 
down in a large pool of her own vomit and blood.

&quot;Oh, God!&quot; Yomi ran over to Tomo and immediately sat her up, propping 
her up against the couch. Most of Tomo&#39;s body moved with rag-doll like 
physics as Yomi moved it. Her lips were covered in vomit stains, and 
apparently, the blood had seeped out of her nose. &quot;Tomo! Tomo! Speak to 
me!&quot;

It was only a few seconds, but it seemed like forever before Tomo moved 
on her own. Jerking her head to one side, she vomited violently on the 
bottom of the couch, then jerked her head to the opposite side, slowly 
opening her eyes to see Yomi.

&quot;Am I...dead?&quot; Tomo asked, and Yomi could sense that she was honestly 
wondering. &quot;Ugh! Ah! My head!&quot; Tomo brought her arms up, clutching her 
noggin tightly, as though it were about to split right down the middle.

&quot;No, Tomo, you&#39;re alright! Hold on, I&#39;ll get you some medicine!&quot; Yomi 
wasted no time in talking or moving. After quickly making sure that her 
lover wouldn&#39;t fall, she ran to the kitchen, searching the cabinets for 
any form of drugs. Finally, she found where they were kept, and began to 
browse through them hastily. &quot;Peptol, Cherry Peptol, Ah! Tylenol!&quot; It 
was a bottle of Tylenol Eight Hour, which she hoped would do just fine. 
Untwisting the lid, Yomi took out one pill, though she would leave this 
bottle out, knowing it would probably be needed later, grabbed a glass, 
filled it with tap water, and ran back to Tomo, who was still clutching 
her head through her now brown and yellow hair.

&quot;Yomi! It hurts!&quot; Tears rolled down the side of Tomo&#39;s face, as she 
cried softly through the small gurgles that she would make when she 
almost hurled. Reasoning that Tomo couldn&#39;t do it herself, Yomi placed 
the pill into her girlfriends mouth, and assisted her in drinking just 
enough water to swallow the pill. Tomo, being her usual self, still 
complained. &quot;It still hurts!&quot; She did however, finally stop throwing up, 
and found herself in Yomi&#39;s arms.

&quot;It&#39;s alright, darling.&quot; There was a large sigh in Yomi&#39;s voice as she 
spoke. &quot;Just gotta let it run it&#39;s course.&quot; She held and caressed her 
young lover, but in her mind, the self-grief was on. &#39;I let this 
happen.&#39; She thought to herself. &#39;I should have burnt that Coke the 
minute I saw it.&#39; Aloud, she sighed again. &#39;Alright, Yomi. Just because 
she took better charge of the situation at first, doesn&#39;t mean she knows 
what&#39;s best for her. You do know what&#39;s best for her. Time to look out 
for her. Be strong, Yomi, be strong.&#39; She sat there with Tomo for a good 
half an hour by the clock, before Tomo finally stopped groaning. Yomi 
just looked down at the one whom she held in her arms. &quot;Heya.&quot;

Tomo weakly looked up to match her look, and returned with an equally 
weak smile. &quot;I&#39;m...sorry.&quot; She spoke barely above a whisper, and Yomi 
guessed that she couldn&#39;t really speak any louder. Mustering all her 
strength, though it didn&#39;t take much to carry Tomo, Yomi hoisted her 
lover up into her arms, and began to walk up the stairs. &quot;Where are we 
going?&quot; Tomo spoke slowly, trying to save her energy.

&quot;Somebody needs a bath.&quot; Yomi smiled perkily and sounded playful. Tomo 
merely returned it.

&quot;Yes mommy...&quot; Yomi honestly couldn&#39;t tell if she was being playful, 
loving, if she was still high, or a combination of the three. Either 
way, she used her free hand to open the door of the bathroom, close it 
back, and helped Tomo undress.

Any other time, the sight of her lover naked might have aroused her. At 
this point, however, Yomi was much more concerned with making sure that 
Tomo was clear, and above all, making sure she&#39;d learned her lesson.

Somewhat, Tomo was able to undress herself from the waist up, but Yomi 
more or less had to assist with her shoes, socks, skirt, and panties, 
for the former really had no energy left. She almost allowed herself to 
fall into the bathtub, like one would fall into bed after a rough day at 
work, but Yomi caught her and sat her down gently, and began to run warm 
water into the bathtub, squirting a very small amount of bubble-bath 
liquid into the tub. The bubbles bubbled up quickly, and a few minutes 
later, the bath was ready, and Yomi found herself pulling up her 
sleeves, and squirting body wash onto a loofa.

&quot;Try and sit up.&quot; Yomi instructed. &quot;I&#39;m going to start with your back.&quot; 
Tomo was able to comply, but only after grabbing on to the faucet, and 
using it to pull herself up, as well as to steady herself as Yomi gently 
washed her back. She would also move down to wash the buttocks, and even 
in her state, Tomo could still tease and smart-mouth.

&quot;You just want to feel my ass up, don&#39;t you?&quot; Tomo accused her. Though 
weakly spoken, it still carried that trademark voice tone of Tomo&#39;s, 
which did assure Yomi that her girlfriend was turning back into herself. 
All the latter could do was sigh.

&quot;I&#39;m gonna smack you if you don&#39;t cut it out, Tomo.&quot; Tomo just smirked.

&quot;Mmmm, I like it like that.&quot; Yomi just rolled her eyes, and began on the 
other side, washing Tomo from the chest down. She also took some shampoo 
to Tomo&#39;s neck-length hair, being careful not to get any of it in her 
eyes or Tomo&#39;s. Neither said much more, until Yomi began to wash her on 
the vagina. Truthfully, Tomo didn&#39;t mean to moan, but a soft one escaped 
her lips.

&quot;What did I tell you earlier?&quot; Yomi scolded slightly.

&quot;That wasn&#39;t on purpose...&quot; Tomo was starting to sound like her energy 
was returning, but this time, she spoke sincerely. Yomi believed her as 
she dunked the loofa in the water to rinse it, and stood up, wiping her 
hands on a nearby towel.

&quot;All done. Think you can dry yourself off?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m a lot better now.&quot; Tomo stood up and stretched, bubbly water 
rolling down her naked body. Yomi had to fight not the be turned on. 
There were more important matters at hand. As she handed Tomo a towel to 
dry off with, Yomi began to lecture, for lack of a better term.

&quot;I hope this taught you something.&quot; She said bluntly. &quot;Did you enjoy 
lying in your own puke?&quot;

&quot;Not particularly.&quot; There wasn&#39;t really a smart-aleck answer that Tomo 
could come up with for that one.

&quot;I didn&#39;t think so.&quot; Yomi really sounded like a parent right here. &quot;Not 
only does it hurt you, but it really hurts me to see you like that. I 
want you to promise me you won&#39;t waste any more money on that.&quot;

&quot;I promise.&quot; Tomo shrugged, like it was nothing.

&quot;Goddammit Tomo!&quot; She was screaming now. &quot;I want to know that you mean 
it!&quot; There was a long silence, and after a few minutes, Tomo, still 
somewhat damp, dropped the towel she was using, and walked over, 
wrapping her arms around Yomi, and looking her dead in the eyes.

&quot;I promise, Yomi.&quot; Tomo said it like she meant it this time. Oh, Yomi 
just had so much of a hard time resisting that voice. Those eyes. And 
she was naked to boot.

&quot;Tomo...&quot; Yomi wrapped her arms around Tomo, pulling her closer into the 
embrace. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for yelling at you.&quot; Tomo&#39;s face was maybe inches 
from Yomi&#39;s.

&quot;It&#39;s alright, Yomi. I understand that it hurts...&quot; Anything that either 
of them would have said next was muffled by the sounds of a deep and 
passionate kiss. Both girls put their all into it, tongue tapping, 
heaving breathing, everything.

But their hands were not idle this time. Tomo initiated the contact, 
taking one of her hands and sliding it up Yomi&#39;s skirt, fondling her 
butt, which caused Yomi to moan with surprised arousal. To Tomo&#39;s 
surprise, Yomi returned the favor, by placing one hand on Tomo&#39;s bare 
butt, and using another to rub what little breasts Tomo did have. This 
kind of bodily contact went on for a few minutes, before Tomo broke the 
kiss, and looked up at Yomi.

&quot;Let&#39;s take this to the bed, eh love?&quot; She said in a seductive voice. 
Yomi just slipped her glasses off, placing them on the bathroom sink, 
and led Tomo back into the bedroom.

If one had accidently wandered into the house, and walked by the stairs, 
the sound of wonderful lesbian love could be heard for the next fifteen 
minutes, before the two finished, and fell asleep, naked in each others 
arms, with a face full of the others body fluids.

Things did not get better for the two over the next six months, however.

Tomo&#39;s promise to quit the Cocaine proved very fragile. The very next 
day, she brought home more. And the day after, and the day after, always 
justifying herself with things like &#39;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll all be okay.&#39; or 
&#39;This is the last day, I promise.&#39;. On days when Yomi was in a bad mood, 
Tomo would often sneak it home. It only got worse when their money 
started to run dry. All of the money from Tomo&#39;s after school job, and 
some from Yomi&#39;s, went to purchasing drugs. When that money ran dry, at 
first, Tomo was able to stop. But the addiction caught up, and she found 
herself selling her body to people on the side, to get more money for 
more drugs. Yomi never knew about this. Either way, Tomo had become a 
Coke-Addict. Yomi blamed herself for never stopping it.

As for Yomi, she wasn&#39;t doing so hot either. Everyday, she planned to 
talk to Nyamo about what Tomo was doing, but Tomo always managed to get 
inside of her head in the bad way. She never told anybody, a costly 
mistake as far as she was concerned. Over the course of time, she became 
depressed, between everything that Tomo was doing, and everything she 
should have been doing. She would never admit it, but she was addicted 
to the same drugs. At first, she found herself snorting the stuff very 
rarely, only when she was extremely depressed. Then, the usage started 
to become more frequent. When she didn&#39;t want to become like Tomo and 
when the few times that she&#39;d cut herself weren&#39;t enough to take away 
the anguish, Yomi found herself visiting the same girl that Tomo did for 
various other drugs. She never was truly addicted, but over the course 
of six months, Yomi had experimented on Weed, LSD, Crack, and Mushrooms 
on multiple occasions in secret. In the end, nothing took away the 
depression. While she was able to quit all of these easily, she&#39;d fucked 
her system up for life. Either way, she had her problems too, but was 
too proud to admit that she&#39;d fucked up like Tomo had.

But their lives were not the only thing in trouble.

Slowly but surely, the Grades of both girls begin to fall. For Tomo, 
nobody was surprised. But for Yomi, everyone became more and more 
curious, but nobody, not even Nyamo at one point, could get her to talk. 
At the Four Month Mark, the two dropped out of school. Between the 
grades, the hassle every morning, and the increasing social abuse from 
the gang, it was just too much.

Ever since Tomo and Yomi had started down the Spiral, since those few 
months before school when they started coming out, the girls had never 
seen the light again. The promises from Mr. Takino and from Nyamo were 
only illusions of all that could have been. But slowly and surely, the 
girls had fallen down, down, down, until finally, though they were blind 
to it, the spiral was coming to and end. Soon, it would all be over.

The beginning of the end all started on that fateful Saturday.

March 22nd, Three months after the drop out, together for nine months.

It all started coming undone...</pre>
