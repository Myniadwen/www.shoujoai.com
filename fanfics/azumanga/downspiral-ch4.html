<a href="../azumanga/downspiral-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Hey guys. Sorry if the story seems to get a little slow this chapter. 
I&#39;m the kinda person that has to string damn near everything together. 
Therefore, Chapter Four might not seem like much, but it puts stuff in 
place, which is all I&#39;m worried about. I know its gonna pick back up 
heavily within the next few chapters though, so keep on reading.




Yomi and Tomo sat silently together on a bench at the Train Station. It 
had been about an hour since Kagura, Sakaki, Chiyo-chan, Kaorin, and 
Osaka had left for Osaka, the city, for the Ballgame that Tomo and Yomi 
were supposed to be sitting at, cheering at, having a good time at right 
now. Right now with their friends. Or at this point, as far as Yomi had 
convinced herself, their former friends.

Tomo had merely broken down and cried in Yomis&#39; arms for quite some 
time. Yomi, on the other hand, had been analyzing this whole outcome, 
and not a bit of it made sense to her. Over and over in her head, she 
went through the scenario, even going so far as to venture into the 
past, thinking back on her friendships of all the girls. Dating back 
years and years, she could think of no evidence that would have made her 
think that any of them would have been discriminatory, or, as in Kaorins 
case, even somewhat homophobic, suggesting that it could have been her.

Yomi sighed. In the past hour, her thoughts and emotions had jumped from 
that of confusion, to resent, to empathy, to anger, and to sorrow. She 
could be sure that in one way or another, Tomo was going through the 
same sort of emotional roller coaster, weather she understood it as well 
or not had yet to be seen. Either way, neither of them had spoken for 
quite some time.

A bell chimed once, and reflexively, the two young girls looked up. The 
large, analog clock atop the loading platform read &#39;1:00 PM&#39;. A sigh 
escaped from Tomos&#39; lips, which marked the first sound outside of 
natural breathing that either had heard from one another in what seemed 
like much longer than sixty minutes. Yomi decided it was finally time to 
break the silence.

&quot;Well...&quot; She started, leaving a long pause after those first two words. 
She was the one that had suggested coming out to her friends, and now 
she had to tread those general waters again, weather she wanted to or 
not meant nothing.

&quot;I think I know what you&#39;re about to get at.&quot; Tomo interrupted Yomis 
train of though. The latter sort of snapped back into reality. There was 
yet another long pausemas the two simply stared into each others eyes, 
each noting the hidden beauty. Even though despair and letdown at this 
point were all over them, each still saw through the other.

Another sign of their care for one another.

&quot;We have to tell our parents.&quot; The two said, in absolute perfect unison. 
They thought the same way, and the evident knowledge of this fact 
brought a smile to the faces of the two young lovers. But the thought, 
though both knew it was something that had to be done. A nod from Yomi 
was the visible confirmation, but overall it was unnecessary, seeing as 
how well the girls understood one another at this point.

&quot;How do you...&quot; It was Tomos turn to chose her words carefully, but for 
a moment, she had to stop altogether to think about if this was the time 
or place for this question. After a few seconds, she decided to ask. 
&quot;How do you think they&#39;ll be?&quot; She finally said, her language a bit 
chopped up. A few possibilities ran through her mind. Not for her sake, 
but for Yomis. This was going to be alot easier for Tomo. &quot;I mean, as 
far as reactions go.&quot;

&quot;Well, it can&#39;t end up being as bad as what happened with the girls. At 
least, I don&#39;t THINK it could.&quot; Yomi countered with a point that Tomo 
had a difficult time arguing. They&#39;d been thrown completely off of their 
perch, caught so utterly off guard by the reaction of their friends, 
that shock had gotten to them. After that, Tomo and Yomi had been 
brought back down to earth. &#39;Lightning never strikes the same place 
twice.&#39; Yomi had muttered earlier. She was absolutely right. The 
lightning had not hit the lightning rod. Rather, it had roasted the fool 
practicing his golf swing in the middle of the storm. &quot;Especially not 
for you, no offense.&quot;

&quot;None taken.&quot; Tomo retorted, though in truth, she wished Yomi would have 
not brought that up. Tomo knew her father, a First Sargent in the Army, 
would have no problem with the fact that Tomo was a lesbian. Since his 
wife, Tomos&#39; mother, had died when she was very young, Mr. Takino had 
always been one to allow Tomo her right to live life to the fullest, so 
long as it was kept within legalities and common sense. Though Tomo 
usually had trouble following the latter, she pretty much knew that when 
it was all said and done, her father would support her in any decision 
she made, and do everything that was needed of him to help her through 
it. Even if he was away on work half the time, even getting the 
occasional call to America or Europe with his Platoon, the bottom line 
was, he was a father that did his best to make the world right for his 
daughter. Tomo often thought that if this man was any indication of the 
woman he&#39;d married, she would have loved to have been able to remember 
her Mom.

Yomi, on the other side of the coin, was just that. The complete 
opposite. Yomis mother was a religious person who believed in following 
her values to the book. Her father wasn&#39;t exactly the big religion freak 
that her mother was, but he would almost always give in to her will. 
Meaning that if Mrs. Mizuhara had a problem with it, Mr. Mizuhara would 
be no help.

And Homosexuality found no place in Mrs. Mizuharas&#39; values.

Yomi sighed very heavily as the thought ran through her head. &quot;Maybe I 
shouldn&#39;t say that.&quot; Yomi stood up, and Tomo took her hand comfortingly. 
She saw now that Yomi was the one about to breakdown. Not on the 
outside, oh no. That was something that never did come to Yomi, and 
maybe never would, but on the inside, she couldn&#39;t even begin to fathom 
the many different things her mother would have planned to say when she 
learned of what her daughter had become.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Yomi. It&#39;ll work out, they&#39;ll understand.&quot; Tomo tried to 
sound as caring as she could. For Yomi, it was easy. She cared deeply 
for her girlfriend, there were no doubts about that. But in such a 
situation close at hand, Tomo wondered if it really would be okay for 
her lover. The more she thought about it, the worse the scenario played 
out in her mind. &quot;They&#39;ll love their precious daughter more than 
whatever God they worship, you-&quot;

&quot;I want to believe that, Tomo, I really do.&quot; Yomi stated flatly, not 
even allowing Tomo to finish, though at this point, both understood they 
were wasting more and more time. &quot;Either way, standing around here does 
nothing for us. We need to get this over with.&quot; Tomo nodded her 
approval.

&quot;It would be that much worse if one of the girls got the message to our 
parents before we did.&quot; Tomos logic actually fitting to a tee this time 
around, and truth be told, she would have been exactly right. &quot;If 
anything, I want to go into this with the world knowing that the two of 
us had nothing to hid.&quot; Yomi smiled serenely at Tomo, and a moment 
later, their lips connected. Not a passionate love kiss, but nothing 
soft either, as the two held for about ten seconds, each getting a small 
amount of tounge.

&quot;Lets go, honey.&quot; Tomo just nodded, and while still holding hands, the 
two walked out of the Train Station, with smiles on their faces once 
again. Tomo understood perfectly, as did Yomi. Being around each other 
made all the pain go away. All the sadness, all the sorrow, all the 
angst, even so far as physical pain, perhaps, could be conquered by 
love. Love conquers all. A cheesy cliche to some, but to Tomo and Yomi 
at that very moment, it emphasized every point of their relationship in 
correlation to the events that had conspired around it and because of 
it. Their love could conquer any hardships that attempted to do it harm. 
At this point in time, Tomo and Yomi were completely assured of that.

But can Love conquer even the beast which corrodes it from the inside? </pre>
