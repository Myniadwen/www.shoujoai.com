Tomo dropped by Yomi&#39;s apartment, unannounced.

Yomi opened the door, studied her for a moment, then sighed. &quot;So, you&#39;re 
here.&quot; She stepped back to allow Tomo inside. &quot;You stayed away for 
nearly two weeks.&quot;

&quot;Did you miss me?&quot;

&quot;Do you really want an answer?&quot;

Tomo looked around. Kaorin didn&#39;t seem to be present. &quot;Are you alone 
tonight?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re standing right beside me.&quot;

&quot;Ha ha, very funny. Is she here?&quot;

Just then, Kaorin burst through the door, without so much as a knock, 
her face flushed a bright pink. She held up a plastic grocery bag. 
&quot;Yomi! I bought some more frosting. Double fudge this time! And I have 
whipped cream, and fresh raspberries to put on top!&quot;

Yomi grinned, her cheeks reddening.

&quot;Whoa! What kind of cake are you baking?&quot; Tomo leaned forward.

Kaorin turned to face Tomo, froze for an instant, then screamed.

Yomi adjusted her glasses. &quot;Cake?&quot;</pre>
