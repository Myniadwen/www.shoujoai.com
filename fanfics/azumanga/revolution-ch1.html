<h1>Girl's Revolution</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../azumanga/index.html">Azumanga Daioh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Tomo&#39;s black and rose edged uniform gleamed as she
gently cradled Yomi in her arms. &quot;The power,&quot; she
declared as she grasped the sword hilt sticking out of
Yomi&#39;s chest in her hands and drew it up, &quot;to
revolutionize the world!&quot;

The class burst into sudden applause, even as Tomo
helped Yomi up to a standing position. Chiyo-chan
smiled as the little brown haired girl asked, &quot;How did
you two do that?&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t all that hard,&quot; Yomi pushed up her glasses,
the rose colored dress swirling around her, &quot;I just
held the sword at my side, out of sight, then held it
so that it looked like the hilt was coming up out of
my chest.&quot;

&quot;Looks like our cosplay-drama cafe is going to work.&quot;
Miss Yukari smiled, her long brown hair flowing over
her shoulders as she sat near enough to watch.

&quot;I still don&#39;t know about us all performing skits,
though,&quot; Osaka said, her catgirl outfit making her
look like an oversized kitten.

Yukari shrugged. &quot;There&#39;s already a maids cafe, not to
mention the swim club,&quot; she dropped her voice to
mutter, &quot;damn that Nyamo,&quot; then continued on, &quot;we need
to have something to make us stand out from the
crowd.&quot;

&quot;She probably has a bet going with Nyamo again,&quot; Tomo
murmured.

&quot;You&#39;re surprised?&quot; Yomi took off her glasses to wipe
at the lenses.

&quot;Where are Sakaki and Kagura?&quot; Kaorin started, the
maid clad young woman looking around eagerly, then
trailed off in shock.

Kagura emerged first, the Chun Li costume that she
wore clinging to the black haired young woman&#39;s body.
With her athletic look it suited her well, making her
look dangerous and sexy. But Kaorin&#39;s eyes were drawn
to Sakaki, who took a simple karate gi and elevated it
to a work of art with her tall, dangerous good looks.

&quot;oh wow...&quot; Kaorin murmured.

&quot;Are you all right?&#39; Chiyo-chan asked her innocently,
seeing how Kaorin&#39;s face was bright red and she was
out of breath.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Kaori made a soft noise as Kagura and Sakaki
began to mock battle in the center of the room. She
felt a bit of alarm at first, knowing that Kagura knew
karate, but Sakaki dodged and fought in the patterns
they had practiced with speed and grace.

&#39;They could be taking things too far,&#39; Yomi thought as
she leaned up against a desk. &quot;I&#39;m just glad no one
suggested that Tomo and I do the movie version,&quot; she
muttered.

&quot;The movie is different?&quot; Tomo looked at Yomi
curiously.

&quot;No,&quot; Yomi cut her off fast.

&quot;Please,&quot; Tomo weedled. When she saw Yomi wasn&#39;t going
to give in she looked around the room and asked, &quot;Has
anyone seen the Utena movie?&quot;

There was a long moment of dead silence then Kaorin
admitted, &quot;Well, I have.&quot;

Tomo practically ran up to her, &quot;So, what was
different in the film?&quot; Kaorin leaned in to whisper in
her ear and Tomo&#39;s eyes got wide as she looked at
Kaorin, &quot;No way.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Kaorin nodded.

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Yomi muttered.

&quot;We have to do it!&quot; Tomo said eagerly to Yomi.

&quot;We do not,&quot; Yomi said flatly.

&quot;It&#39;d be great,&quot; Tomo said eagerly.

&quot;Too embarrassing,&quot; Yomi shook her head.

&quot;How long do you think it&#39;ll take her to convince
Yomi?&quot; Kagura said wryly as she stretched, her tight
costume clinging as she moved.

&quot;Not too long,&quot; Sakaki answered quietly.

&quot;Yeah, Tomo has Yomi so whipped,&quot; Kagura smirked.

&quot;Whipped?&quot; Sakaki looked a bit startled.

Kagura gave her a amused look, &quot;I&#39;ll explain later.&quot;

&quot;Please?&quot; Tomo drew the word out cutely as she
followed the annoyed looking Yomi around the
classroom, dodging various costumed figures as they
did.

&quot;All right,&quot; Yomi finally threw her hands in the air
after nearly half an hour of teasing requests from her
partner.

&quot;All right!&quot; Tomo cheered, &quot;How do you want to do
this?&quot;

Yomi suddenly felt everyone&#39;s eyes on them and
grimaced. &quot;We&#39;re practicing first,&quot; she said as she
held the prop sword in one hand and grabbed Tomo with
the other, &quot;let&#39;s head up to the roof.&quot;

The sun shone down on them as they opened the stairway
door and stepped outside, the breeze ruffling their
hair. &quot;Kaorin told me what happened in the film,&quot; Tomo
said, &quot;but how do we want to do it?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s see,&quot; Yomi muttered as she carefully held the
sword concealed at her side, &quot;hold still.&quot; She turned
and swiftly raced towards Tomo, startling her as she
cupped her face one handed. She drew her into what was
intended to be a chaste kiss...

...but Tomo&#39;s mouth opened a little as their tongue&#39;s
brushed softly, a flash of something passing between
them. Yomi fell back in Tomo&#39;s arms, shifting the
sword so it was visible, then in a dramatic gesture
drew it forth.

&quot;What&#39;s with the tongue!?&quot; Yomi blurted once they were
finished.

&quot;Hehehe, I kind of got carried away there,&quot; Tomo
scratched the back of her head sheepishly as she
admitted, &quot;it was my first kiss, after all. &quot;

&quot;Mine too,&quot; Yomi admitted before blinking in surprise
at Tomo, &quot;Seriously?!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m surprised that way your first kiss,&quot; Tomo looked
up at Yomi as they moved over to lean against the
fence that circled the roof, &quot;you&#39;re beautiful, smart
and even have breasts.&quot;

Yomi blushed, pushing up her glasses. &quot;There&#39;s never
been anyone I&#39;ve been interested in,&quot; she shrugged
uncomfortably. She looked at Tomo sideways and added,
&quot;Besides, I&#39;ve seen the guys look at you, too.&quot;

&quot;Not the way they do you,&quot; Tomo flashed a smile, &quot;but
thanks.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well,&quot; Yomi looked away, &quot;I wasn&#39;t just trying
to be nice.&quot;

Tomo snickered softly. &quot;That kiss.. that was pretty
fun,&quot; Tomo said after a while, smiling at her
slightly.

Yomi gave Tomo a wary look, but she saw only simple
honesty in her eyes. &quot;I enjoyed it too,&quot; she admitted,
&quot;so?&quot;

&quot;I think that sword draw ended up being awkward, and I
was stiff with the kiss, too,&quot; Tomo mused, &quot;but I
think things could be smoother with practice.&quot;

&quot;Practice?&quot; Yomi felt herself smiling.

&quot;Yes, but I&#39;m a little slow,&quot; Tomo said as she moved a
few steps away, answering that smile, &quot;it could take a
lot of practice to improve.&quot;

&quot;Maybe we could practice at my home later, too,&quot; Yomi
mused.

&quot;See? Lots of practice,.&quot; Tomo grinned.

&quot;Let&#39;s try it again, then,&quot; and Yomi rushed to plant
her lips on Tomo&#39;s once again.

End

Notes: Tomo and Yomi are a interesting pair, and I&#39;ve
often wondered what would happen to them after
graduation. I think they&#39;d either fall in love.. or
kill each other. :lol: Inspired by a lovely picture by
bluecorgi23, as well as the Utena movie. The idea of a
Cosplay Cafe was mentioned in one of the comments for
bluecorgi23&#39;s pic, so thanks to CaptainBlaine for that idea.</pre>
