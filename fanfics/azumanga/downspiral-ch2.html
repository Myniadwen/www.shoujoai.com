<h1>Downward Spiral (part 2 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../azumanga/index.html">Azumanga Daioh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/paec.html">PAEC</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../azumanga/downspiral-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Late late late late LATE! They&#39;re always LATE!&quot; The young, short-brown 
haired high schooler was pacing back and forth. Kagura usually wasn&#39;t 
the one to beat on Yomi and Tomo for being late, but this was sports, 
something that took a completely different light in Kaguras&#39;eyes. She&#39;d 
been ranting for the past ten minutes, when Tomo and Yomi were supposed 
to have showed up at the train station.

&quot;Miss Kagura, please, calm down!&quot; The young, peace keeper of the group, 
11 year old, red head Chiyo Mihama, did her best to calm her agitated 
friend down, though to the other three girls present, it became clear a 
bit ago that Kaguras&#39; impatience would only end when the two missing 
friends became present.

&quot;Chiyo-chan...&quot; Sakaki, the tallest of the group, with long blue hair 
that dangled down to her lower back, spoke with a hint of a laugh in her 
voice. It was somewhat amusing to her. No matter the odds or the 
circumstances, Chiyo would always try to restore order. Maybe she was 
just still as naive as one of her age would be. Or maybe she did 
understand what she was doing. It didn&#39;t matter to Sakaki, or any of the 
friends, for that matter. Chiyo was who she was, and there was nothing 
more to it.

&quot;You&#39;re just gonna have ta wait, Chiyo-chan.&quot; Spoke the next in line. 
Standing right beside Sakaki, this short, brown haired girl looked 
almost tiny, as Sakaki was a mountain by comparison. Young Ayumu Kasuga, 
nicknamed Osaka by the group, to the point that sometimes even she 
forgot her real name, was only taller than Chiyo on the group, and not 
by much. The girl who&#39;d moved from Osaka, Japan, to Tokyo a year ago, 
Osaka was also a kind spirited person, but in her case, it was more out 
of mental density than anything else. Still, to the friends, a kind 
spirit was a kind spirit none the less, and Osaka was a prime example.

&quot;She&#39;s right, you know.&quot; The final friend standing off to the side, she 
too, had short brown hair, though it was kept more straight than Osaka 
or Tomo kept theirs. She was a few inches taller than Osaka, and had 
only become reciently aquainted with more of the people in this group 
because of her long standing friendship with Yomi. Next to Tomo, Kaorin 
had probably known Yomi the longest, but even she was surprised of 
Yomi&#39;s tardiness as of late. In the end, though, like everyone else, 
she&#39;d shrugged it off as nothing more than Tomo&#39;s fault.

Around that time, the train pulled into the station, and people began 
loading on and unloading. Kagura was about to start ranting once again, 
but was cut off by the Station-Wide Intercom. &quot;The Train first train en 
route to Osaka has arrived at Platform A, and is now boarding for 
passengers schedualed to be at the Osaka Dome later today. The train 
schedueled to arrive at Platform B en route to the same destination has 
run into railway problems. Please allow five to ten minutes for the next 
train to arrive. Thank you.&quot; Kaguras&#39; mood went from bad to worse rather 
easily at this point.

&quot;Bah!&quot; She spat, causing a passing by elderly man to nearly jump out of 
his shirt, &quot;Son of a bitch! First Tomo and Yomi are late, now we&#39;re 
gonna miss our damn train!&quot;

&quot;Well, look at it this way.&quot; Kaorin was hoping to be able to calm Kagura 
down in some way, but things at this point were&#39;nt looking so great. 
&quot;The other train had some problems. We&#39;ll catch it.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sakaki followed up, seeing what Kaorin was getting at. &quot;We&#39;ll 
still make it to the Buffalos game, don&#39;t worry Kagura.&quot;

&quot;We damn well better!&quot; Kagura just continued to pace around, mumbling a 
mixture of obscenities and complaints under her breath. Everyone else 
just sighed, except for Osaka, who had her gaze fixated on the stairs 
that lead up into the station lobby.

&quot;There they are.&quot; Osaka stated calmly. Everyone else turned to look 
immediatly, and sure enough, there came the missing two of the group, 
running up the stairs, sweating decently as they slowed to a panting 
stop right before the other five, none of whom looked too happy to see 
them. Sure, before, it&#39;d been simple stuff, like being late to just hang 
out, but this was more serious. Train tickets to baseball games were not 
exactly cheap when purchased in bulk packages.

&quot;About damn ti-&quot; Kagura started, but moments later found Sakaki&#39;s hand 
covering her mouth. Sakaki than began to speak herself before Kagura 
could break free.

&quot;What she&#39;s TRYING to say,&quot; Sakaki started, sounding somewhat irritated, 
partially at Tomo and Yomi, but partially at Kagura also, who wasn&#39;t 
about to help the situation anyway. &quot;Is that you two are late. Again. 
It&#39;s been like that since that trip to Magical Land the two of you 
took.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re...we&#39;re sorry...&quot; Yomi was bent over, hands resting on her knees 
as she spoke between heavy breaths. Evidently, the two had realized 
that, even with their little discussion on what course of action they 
should take, they had realized that they had both taken WAY too long 
getting ready. For Tomo, this was expected, as she was usually the one 
to drag out of bed and take her precious time waking up. For Yomi, 
however, this was all new, and the group had began to think that Tomo&#39;s 
bad influince was finally starting to rub off.

&quot;W...We just kinda...&quot; Tomo tried to finish the explanation, but didn&#39;t 
get far. Her constant panting made it easy for the others to cut her 
off.

&quot;You were just late. Again.&quot; Kaorin got straight to it.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s not like we&#39;ll be missing our train, thankfully.&quot; Chiyo-chan 
attempted to bring up something positive to try and change the overall 
mood to something good. Again, it was just how she was. This comment did 
bring the mood back up for Tomo, who jumped up instantly, feeling 
rejuvinated instantly by the situation she thought she understood.

&quot;See?&quot; Tomo, energetic as always, voiced proudly. &quot;We&#39;re not late, you 
guys&#39;re worrying over nothin&#39;!&quot; At this point, Kagura finally broke free 
from Sakaki&#39;s grip.

&quot;Wrong!&quot; Kagura was red, though that was somewhat the fault of Sakaki, 
covering up her nose and mouth for about a minute. Though the star of 
the swim team could not be so easily suffocated. Tomo looked on with a 
somewhat comical look of confusion, but nobody was laughing, and Yomi 
was still breathing heavily. &quot;You&#39;re late, alright! You two&#39;re just also 
really damn LUCKY!&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Came the synchronized response of Yomi and Tomo. Kagura looked 
about ready to burst with anger.

&quot;There are two trains leaving for Osaka.&quot; Kagura spoke with an agitated 
tone in her voice, and wasn&#39;t attempting to hide her anger one bit. 
Kagura never hid her emotions. Sometimes, that fact was beneficial. In 
other situations, such as this one, it merely had the potential to make 
a mess of things, though she seemed to be getting her point across. 
&quot;One, the one at Platform A, just came, boarded, and left. The one 
schedualed to arrive at Platform B, was delayed, and should get here 
soon.&quot; Reality came over Tomo and Yomi, especially Tomo, who&#39;d just been 
knocked off of her high and mighty pedistal. Then again, that was 
something that occured often.

There came a long silence. The group of seven were literally the only 
people on the waiting platform at this point. everyone had boarded the 
empty train bound for Osaka. All but them, at least.

What seemed like several minutes passed before the silence was broken, 
and that breaker came in the form of Yomis&#39; voice.

&quot;Well then...&quot; She shot a quick look at Tomo, who figured she knew what 
was coming, out of the corner of her eye before continuing on. &quot;I guess 
this presents a good oppertunity to break it to you all.&quot; Almost 
immediatly, everyone else lost all anger. Concern for their friends took 
over. Even Kagura, though it took her a moment longer, seemed now more 
anxious than anything.

&quot;Tell us what?&quot; Osaka stated bluntly. Flat and blunt. That was the only 
Osaka any of them knew.

&quot;Is everything alright?&quot; Sakaki was the first to check, always being 
concerned for the well being of her friends before herself.

&quot;Are y&#39;all pregnant?&quot; Osaka said, qith equal bluntness. Everyone just 
kinda sighed in unison, including Yomi and Tomo themselves, to which 
Kaorin took notice.

&quot;Wait...&quot; She stammered, thinking she&#39;d realized it. &quot;ARE YOU?&quot; Kaorin 
had known Yomi for many years, and it would have made her jump out of 
her skin for something like this to happen to the Yomi she knew. 
Luckily, or unluckily, perhaps, she was very far from the truth. Tomo 
and Yomi were quick to disprove that theory.

&quot;No! No! That&#39;s not it! Far from it!&quot; The two girls on the defense 
pleaded, at exactly the same time, before looking at each other and 
looking back.

&quot;Look,&quot; Yomi went on. Tomo figured it better for her to be the one to 
start into this. You&#39;ve probably heard one person say about another 
person, &#39;She has such a way with words.&#39; Well, one would not find 
themselves saying this about Tomo Takino, and that was why she chose, at 
this moment, to be seen and not heard. &quot;We&#39;re alright, we&#39;re fine. But 
we don&#39;t know how you will take this.&quot; The statement brought forth even 
more curiosity to the likes of Kagura, Osaka, Sakaki, Kaorin, and 
Chiyo-chan. Yomi just wnet on, knowing that this was going to be hard, 
no matter how the friends percieved it. Though suddenly, Tomo cut her 
off.

&quot;You were right about one thing, this DOES pertain to the trip to 
Magical Land.&quot; Said Tomo, in the absolute calmest state anyone had ever 
seen her in, even Yomi. &quot;We didn&#39;t know how to come out and say this, so 
we didn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;But earlier today,&quot; Yomi went back to talking. &quot;and this is why we were 
late, somewhat, we decided that if we let this go on very long, it&#39;d 
just be worse in the end, so we figured, whatever happens, we may as 
well get it off our chests.&quot;

None of the other five girls said anything. What could they say? They 
had no leads whatsoever as to what this could mean, not even a guess. 
Osaka had already covered the pregnancy corner, though truthfully that 
idea hadn&#39;t really dawned on any of them until Osaka had suggested it. 
No guesses, no ideas, no nothing. All any of them could do was stand 
there and wait for the final word.Not a one of them had any idea of the 
shock that was about to go through them.

With one final sigh, Yomi looked at Tomo, who merely nodded. The two 
were already standing side by side, which helped for the visual that 
would emphasize this point. Tomo was the first to act, as she put her 
arm around Yomis&#39; waist and held her. Yomi placed her arm more around 
Tomos&#39; back, and her hand rested on the smaller girls&#39; shoulder.

&quot;We&#39;re in love.&quot; Tomo stated flatly. Yomi just nodded. There was no long 
pause this time, but not exactly the initial reaction Tomo and Yomi had 
expected.

&quot;Come again?&quot;

&quot;Say what?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Is this some kind of joke?&quot; Kagura was the last one to ask. &quot;Tomo, this 
sin&#39;t funny. Our train&#39;s going to be getting here soon and-&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s no joke, Kagura!&quot; Yomi didn&#39;t want to hear it this way. This is 
how it always was. If something went wrong, or if there was an excuse, 
anything of the like, the blame always fell on Tomos&#39; shoulders. Yomi 
was tired of it, even though most of the time, it WAS Tomos&#39; fault, this 
wasn&#39;t a case of the boy who cried wolf. &quot;I&#39;m the one that confessed! 
I&#39;m the one that has loved her for about as long as I can remember! It 
didn&#39;t feel natural, it didn&#39;t feel right at first, but slowly it came 
around! I made reservations for that trip at Magical Land to confess to 
her, and I found exactly what I&#39;d been looking for, which was love back! 
I&#39;m Koyomi Mizuhara, and she&#39;s Tomo Takino, and we&#39;re girlfriends!&quot; Yomi 
wrapped the surprised Tomo Takino in a tight embrace to drive the point 
home. Yomi has guessed that if the word could come from her mouth, it 
would be believed as the truth that it was.

Unfortunatly, she was exactly right.

Another long pause, as the five other friends stood there, in shock, 
mouths gaping open as to what they just heard. From Tomo, this could be 
nothing more than a stupid joke to get her off the hook. But Yomi? She 
never lied, she never made excuses. She took credit for her good 
actions, and owned up for her few bad ones. At this point, though, 
nobody wanted to believe her, even though her credibility made even 
something like this hard to shake off so easily. Then, after they 
thought about it a moment, again, though they didn&#39;t want to believe 
what they were hearing, the pieces of the puzzle all fell into place. 
Since the Magical Land trip, Tomo had calmed down signifigently, Yomi 
had started picking up habits she&#39;d never had before, and the two NEVER 
showed up seperatly.

It all made sense, and after about a minute of silence, Kaorin, Sakaki, 
Osaka, and Kagura understood it exactly.

Chiyo, however, with her usual School Girl mentality, didn&#39;t see the 
possibility.

&quot;But...wait...&quot; She started, breaking the silence. &quot;You&#39;re both 
girls...You aren&#39;t allowed to do that.&quot;

&quot;Sorry Chiyo-chan, but-&quot; Yomi started, but was taken aback by the two 
things she saw. Sakaki had now placed her hands over Chiyos&#39; ears, and 
the four girls except Chiyo were giving the two a death look that meant 
trouble. Trouble that Tomo and Yomi thought that they would not run 
into.

The lightning had struck, but not in the same place this time. </pre>
