<h1>I'll Be on the Road Again</h1>

<pre>-So many times I was alone and couldn&#39;t sleep

You left me drowning in the tears of memory- 

The road at night was pitch black; this far from home, there were no 
street lights, and I could scarcely see but a few feet in front of me 
with the headlights on. Hesitantly, I leaned back in the driver&#39;s seat 
and pushed the speedometer down to twenty, cruising lazily down the 
vacant country roads. My hands resting with only the slightest grip on 
the steering wheel, I pressed the button that opened my window just a 
bit, unable to stand the smell of animal crackers, broken crayons and 
apple juice that had come to inhabit my car in the past nine years. 
Frigid December air came seeping in through the crack, and I breathed 
deeply despite the cold. It shocked my senses back into believing, and 
that felt good. 

-And ever since you&#39;ve gone I&#39;ve found it hard to breathe

&#39;Cause there was so much that your heart just couldn&#39;t see- 

Twenty years ago, sailing down an empty road at midnight would&#39;ve felt 
like freedom. Fresh, icy air would have excited me, the darkness 
intrigued me, but not anymore. Now, the frigid cold felt like new coats 
for Toshi and Nara, and the darkness preceded a trip to the local 
drugstore for flashlight batteries. Twenty years ago, a diamond was 
jewelry; now, it was commitment. Now what used to be a golden 
oppurtunity had dissolved into a bitter loneliness, a dark void strung 
with guilt and regret. Twenty years ago, an envelope with an offhand 
note from a high-school classmate and a Kodak photograph had been 
something to cherish, something to keep next to your heart. Now, it was 
something to be ashamed of. Something to hide. 

-A thousand wasted dreams are rolling off my eyes

But time&#39;s been healing me, and I say good-bye- 

On an impulse, I wrenched off the glittering band and flung it out the 
open window, breathing hard as I watched the golden glimmer recede into 
the darkness. It was nothing but an empty promise. My home, my things, 
my children, all paid for with his money and nurtured with his love - I 
would have lived on the streets to be free of it all. All of it was 
meaningless, all of it a symbol of his commitment to me; all of it a 
glass half-empty, waiting for me to fill the other half with my 
gratitude. How could he do this to me? How dare he vie for a place in my 
heart, when it was already so full it could burst? How could he possibly 
expect me to cherish him, when the only thing I had ever truly cherished 
had always lain just out of my reach?  How could he expect so much of 
me, when she expected so little... -wanted- so little? It hurt. God, it 
hurt worse than anything in the world. And I couldn&#39;t manage love when I 
was full of rejection.     

-&#39;Cause I can breathe again, dream again

I&#39;ll be on the road again- 

It wasn&#39;t that I hated him. Koichi was a nice man; he wanted the best 
for me, always had. I had no one to blame but myself for all this - I 
had been the one who had agreed to it, when my parents pushed the 
subject. He was the son of a friend of theirs, looking for someone...and 
I was happy. I was happy buying goldfish at a hundred yen a pop, taking 
them in for check-ups every week or so just so I could see her face. I 
was happy walking past her office every day on my way to the caf&eacute;, or 
the drugstore, or just across the street and back again, hoping to catch 
a glimpse of her from outside. Even the racing heart, the cold sweat, 
the butterflies in my stomach were better than the dredge of 
predictability that came with every day, the nausea that welled up in my 
stomach at another grueling day of this charade. I didn&#39;t want this, 
didn&#39;t need it, not so long as I had her. Not so long as I had the 
fantasy of her in my head, not so long as my dreams kept me loving her. 
But what were they, in the end, but dreams? 

-Like it used to be the other day

Now I feel free again, so innocent

&#39;Cause someone makes me whole again...- 

I had been weak. I had been weak, and now I was paying the price. As I - 
in a voice low and full of masked dread, on that fateful day almost ten 
years ago - had promised Koichi my everlasting love, another part of me 
had begun to melt away. It was as if my heart were being slowly and 
carefully pulled out, each nerve and vein separating bit by bit until 
nothing was left but an empty chamber and a puddle of blood. It was a 
feeling I later recognized as lost hope, and the melting was complete by 
the time Toshi was born. They called it postpartum depression, but they 
didn&#39;t know. No one had ever really known, because no one had ever 
really cared. Of course, it wasn&#39;t as if I&#39;d have told them if they&#39;d 
ask. She was something I liked to keep to myself, a secret pleasure that 
I could feel extravagant in longing for. My best kept, most indulgent 
secret, a blessed secret that traveled with me everywhere and kept me 
alive. A faded photograph, a pair of high-school-girls, an everlasting 
dream, and it was all I had to remind me that once upon a time, I had 
had something to live for.

 

-For sure

I&#39;ll find another you.- 

Reaching into my flannel-lined coat, I withdrew the scrap of paper from 
an inside pocket, and flicked on the overhead light. Drawing in my 
breath ever so slightly at the sight, I ran my fingers over the dusty 
surface, cradling her face with a fingernail. As the car ambled smoothly 
along the desolate country road, I lost myself in a haze of memory. How 
it felt to be impassioned, how it felt to care. How it felt to devote 
yourself to someone without regret, without denial, and make yourself 
about them. -Who am I without you?- 

-Could you imagine someone else is by my side

I&#39;ve been afraid I couldn&#39;t keep myself from falling- 

The age-old question rang in my ears. Who was I without her? An empty 
shell, going through the motions. A shameless failure, in love with a 
woman who had never cared for me, and cared for by a family that I had 
never wanted. A miserable wreck in denial, a plaster smile painted onto 
a straining face, a time bomb that kept ticking but could never quite 
feel the release of explosion. As I had defined myself by her, without 
her I had no definition. I was but a ghost, a shade of a woman called 
Kaori, who felt nothing and everything all at the same time. A woman 
called Kaori, who did not know rejection when it stared at her with 
beautiful blue eyes, who could not accept love when it welcomed her with 
open eyes. A rebel without a cause, a lesbian without a lover, and 
someone who was apt let everyone down. Someone could not listen to her 
heart, because it had always been consumed with a woman called Sakaki. 

-My heart was always searching for a place to hide

Could not wait for dawn to bring another day- 

&quot;I tried, dammit!&quot; I screamed to the starless sky, &quot;Don&#39;t you think I&#39;ve 
tried?&quot; Falling back in the seat, livid at the world, I felt tears 
stream down my cheeks and didn&#39;t bother to wipe them. It wasn&#39;t as if I 
had meant it to be this way. I found alternate routes through town, 
without passing by the veterinary office. I kept the photo in my 
dresser, rather than in my jacket pocket. I kept the memories tucked 
away, put the longing aside, and tried to channel my love into something 
new. And when I couldn&#39;t...well, I tried to make the lie convincing. But 
for all my efforts, the memories still haunted me, and it wasn&#39;t fair. 
It wasn&#39;t fair to me, it wasn&#39;t fair to her, and most of all, it wasn&#39;t 
fair to them. Koichi, so enchanted with a woman he didn&#39;t know could 
never love him; Toshi and Nara, counting on a mother&#39;s love that didn&#39;t 
exist. Even Maeko, so little, who had barely seen the passing of a week 
on this planet - I was letting Maeko down, even now. Last week in the 
hospital, when they&#39;d brought her in swaddled and pink-cheeked in a 
gingham fuzzy blanket, when I&#39;d felt her weight in my weary arms for the 
first time, all I could feel was revulsion towards her. I wanted to hand 
her back, tell the nurses they&#39;d made a mistake, that she wasn&#39;t my baby 
and I didn&#39;t want her. I hated myself for it, but I didn&#39;t want her.   

-You&#39;re not the only one, so hear me when I say

The thoughts of you, they just fade away- 

Poor little Maeko. She deserved so much better than me. They all did. 
When it came to that, I should have left them ages ago, but somehow I 
had thought this might be good for me. Having this...this semblance of a 
family, it might help me to pick up the pieces. Might help me emerge 
from her shadow after all those years; help me get over the relationship 
that would have, should have, could never have been. Yet the more I 
tried, the more I found I had liked being her shadow. Even if I couldn&#39;t 
so much as touch her hand, lingering at the sidelines of her life was 
preferable to losing her completely. But what was I supposed to have 
done? -I&#39;m sorry, Koichi, but I&#39;m leaving you to obsess over a girl I 
went to high school with.- It was too late. It had been for some time.  

-&#39;Cause I can breathe again, dream again

I&#39;ll be on the road again- 

I slowed to a stop at a fork in the road, switching on my high beams to 
better read the road signs. To the left, a short, squat sign decorated 
with colorful images - supposedly in that direction lay a shabby motel, 
a few fast-food restaurants, and a gas station. That road extended for 
miles into the distance, and far away I caught a glimpse of a few pairs 
of headlights and a lit restaurant sign. But the sign on the left was 
wooden, tacked onto a plank nailed into the ground, most likely put 
there whoever owned this vast land. The words -Dead End- were scrawled 
onto the splintering surface of the wood in a paint that had begun to 
chip, and the road it advertised curved sharply at a patch of scruffy 
trees, its ending unforseen by the likes of me. For a moment, I 
considered it; turning to the left, that is, high-gearing it towards a 
bright future in a land unknown. Perhaps checking into the little motel, 
having a quick meal at a diner in town, and calling up my old friends in 
Osaka, Kawasaki, and Nagoya to see if I could stay with them. Chihiro 
always had room for me. I could stay with her, just until I got on my 
feet again. I could move somewhere exotic, maybe travel, see the world. 
Or I could move back to my hometown, drive past the veterinarian&#39;s 
office eight times a day, because there would be no Toshi and Nara to 
complain about the long car ride. I could hang the photograph on the 
wall in a frame, because there would be no Koichi to wonder why. I could 
dream my lovely dreams of her without being awoken by Maeko&#39;s 
fire-engine wail in the middle of the night. It would be wonderful. I 
would be free again. 

-Like it used to be the other day

Now I feel free again, so innocent

&#39;Cause someone makes me whole again...- 

Freedom. What a cruel jest. If I were gone for even a day without 
notice, Koichi would have the entire town out searching for me. He&#39;d 
think I was abducted, possibly raped, beaten, killed. I&#39;d be on the 
news, in the paper, on fliers stapled to telephone poles all across 
Tokyo. They&#39;d find me, and I&#39;d be taken home in shame, subject to the 
disapproving stares of neighbors and friends. I would break Koichi&#39;s 
heart, I would, and destroy his family, and no matter how detached I 
felt from them, I couldn&#39;t do that. Love blinds you from the strangest 
of things, but this was one thing it couldn&#39;t shield me from. Their pain 
would be palpable, and I would be responsible, and no amount of sweet 
dreams could fix that. And yet the thought of turning the car in reverse 
sickened me to the point that my stomach stirred, and so I had but one 
option, one dismal venue for the end of this farce. A bittersweet idea 
that I had toyed with for some time, and had pushed itself to the front 
of my mind a week earlier at Maeko&#39;s birth. A shift in my seat, a hand 
on the wheel, the flashing dim of the headlights, and a turn to the 
right. 

-For sure

I&#39;ll find another you- 

Slowly, ever slowly, the numbers on the speedometer rose from twenty to 
forty to sixty, and I cleared the curve ahead to meet with a stretch of 
open road flanked by trees on either side. As I flew down the road with 
steadily increasing speed, a sense of calm overtook me as I thought of 
Koichi. I could leave my husband and children innocent - sad, but 
innocent, and oblivious to the truly shameful nature of the one they so 
loved. They would not know my core of desperation and denial, but my 
fa&ccedil;ade of cheerfulness and courage, and it would be better for all of 
us. If I was lucky the minivan might combust on impact, leaving no 
incriminating traces of an event staged and planned. In my idyllic 
state, it didn&#39;t even concern me that I was combing over the details of 
my suicide, blissfully unaware of what consequences lay ahead; all I 
could think was that it was finally over, and there would be no more 
lies. No more hiding, no more secrets, no more longing for what I could 
not possess. Only an endless sea of darkness and flame. 

-Sometimes I see you when I close my eyes

You&#39;re still a part of my life- 

Rounding the last corner at a speed close to one hundred, my eyes fell 
upon what I had been so longing for: a solid stone wall at least five 
feet high, a segment of the barrier that divided this farmer&#39;s land from 
the fields neighboring his. But even as I flew over the cracked 
pavement, past the sagging trees and tattered shrubs at a speed that 
would normally have terrified me, I felt as if I were floating. Similar 
to the feeling of the tender touch of her hands, akin to the warmth of 
her occasional smile, likened to the soft sweetness of her voice, the 
sensation was wonderful, and left me wondering why I hadn&#39;t done this 
sooner. Every one of my last moments swelled with my memories and my 
love for her, the deep enchantment that had led me to so many years of 
longing. But somehow, while I was floating, it was all right. Somehow, 
even when the pain hit like a tidal wave, even when the sounds of 
shattering glass and screaming tires filled my ears, even when blood 
rose and spilled from my mouth, the pain of the last ten years blurred 
and left me to my beautiful dreams.  

-But I can breathe again, dream again

I&#39;ll be on the road again

Like it used to be the other day

Now I feel free again, so innocent

&#39;Cause someone makes me whole again...- 

Even as my heart slowed to its ultimate stop, it was as deeply in love 
as ever. As the final rush of air left my dry lips, I whispered her name 
into the rising inferno. &quot;I&#39;ll always love you, Sakaki-san,&quot; I murmured 
before the darkness closed in, &quot;Even if it kills me.&quot; 

-For sure

I&#39;ll find another you...- 

-I&#39;ll find another you.- </pre>
