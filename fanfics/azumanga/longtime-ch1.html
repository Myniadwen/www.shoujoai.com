<h1>Long Time</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../azumanga/index.html">Azumanga Daioh</a>

<pre>Her lips burned my skin with each kiss she placed. My body was burning, 
burning for her. She assaulted my clit with her tongue and her hands 
squeezed my breasts softly. I was so close to cumming that I could 
scream. However, the chance never came as the sound of my alarm cut my 
dream through. My breath came in short pants as I laid in bed, staring 
as the ceiling.

This wasn&#39;t the first dream I&#39;ve had of her. Ever since we first met in 
high school, I&#39;ve had these kinds of dreams involving us. Each time, I 
wake up like this, short of breath and wet beyond belief. &quot;Snap out of 
it, Minamo,&quot; I mumbled to myself as I got up from my futon. This was 
part of the ritual I went through after having these kinds of dreams of 
Yukari - reality check and denial. If I deny that I wanted her and 
reassured myself that she was straight the the dream just meant how 
much I cared for her as a friend.

Yet I couldn&#39;t convince myself of that this morning. I obviously wanted 
her even more each passing day. Today would be the day I did something. 
Or maybe not, seeing how it was the weekend and I wouldn&#39;t see her 
until Monday, usually if I was lucky. &#39;Ding Dong, the doorbell 
interrupted my thoughts.

&quot;Yukari! ,&quot; I gasped as I opened the door.

&quot;Hey, Nyamo,&quot; She said sleepily as she pushed past me.

&quot;What the hell are you doing here so early? ,&quot; I asked knowing I&#39;d hate 
the answer.

&quot;I was out drinking last night but I told my mom I&#39;d be here. 
Goodnight,&quot; She said as she climbed into my futon.

My eyebrow twitched in anger as I wondered for the zillionth time, 
since I&#39;ve known her, why I wanted her so much. And as I watched her 
sleeping face, it hit me. She was beautiful and funny, despite being 
ridiculous and an idiot most times. Yukari turned toward me and opened 
her eyes slightly.

&quot;Why&#39;re you staring at me, Nyamo?&quot;

&quot;Because I love you.&quot; The words left my mouth before I had even 
realized it. As her eyes widen, I knew it was too late to take it back.

&quot;Love me? Like a friend? ,&quot; She asked slowly. Then with a cocky smile, 
&quot;Or because you wanna fuck me?&quot;

My breath stopped and my face burned in embarrassment. &quot;W-what? I&#39;m not 
like . . .&quot; Yukari grasped my hand and stopped my poor attempt at an 
excuse. She was smiling.

&quot;Nyamo, why do think I became a teacher? Because you were going to be 
one and I wanted to be with you. If anything, I&#39;m not the one who&#39;s 
been dying to fuck you and I haven&#39;t because I was afraid of losing 
you.&quot;

I was speechless, then suspicious.

&quot;How long did you rehearse saying that?&quot;

&quot;Since college . . .,&quot; She laughed. &quot;But it&#39;s true.&quot;

Her laughed reeled me in, whether it should happen or not was no longer 
a question. I pulled her up and kissed her hard. Yukari didn&#39;t object 
as I slid my tongue into her mouth. I grabbed her everywhere possible, 
forcing low moans from her. It wasn&#39;t my nature to be rough but I 
wanted her so badly. As clothes fell away, her skin and touch was as 
soft as it was in my dreams.

Somehow we ended up on my futon, Yukari kneeling over my naked body. 
Just like my dream, her kiss ignited with each touch. Her soft touch, 
which actually surprised me, would soothe anywhere her lips burn. When 
she touched my pussy, I fought back the sudden urge to cum. Her fingers 
slipped into me and pushed deep in. I clung to her as I came from the 
years of dreams of her.

&quot;You cum like a virgin,&quot; She teased as she repositioned herself.

&quot;Oh, shut up,&quot; I said in embarrassment.

Her lips wrapped around my clit and she teased me her tongue. I closed 
my eyes as a second orgasm pulled me under. Yukari pushed several 
fingers into me again, pushing them the same way she had before. My 
hips rocked against her as I felt the first spasms rip through me. Even 
after the second orgasm had subsided, Yukari didn&#39;t stop her assault on 
me. I must&#39;ve cum five times within a few minutes. After the last one, 
she pulled away she pulled away from my exhausted body.

&quot;I swear you cum like a virgin sixteen year old,&quot; She teased again.

Embarrassed and tired, I didn&#39;t say anything. Instead, I rolled her 
onto her back, placing my knee firmly against her wet pussy. She pushed 
against my knee, rubbing herself against me as I kissed her. To my 
surprise, she came quicker then I had first time.

&quot;Who cums like a sixteen-year-old virgin? ,&quot; I asked.

&quot;You caught me off guard, that&#39;s all!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, right.&quot;

&quot;I bet you it won&#39;t happen again!&quot;

Determined, she tried not to goran as I pushed two fingers into her, 
then two more. Yukari&#39;s face was flushed but she bit her lips as I 
moved them in and out. Grinning, I added my thumb so that my whole fist 
was in her. Yukari screamed out in pleasure as she moved her hips in 
time with my thrusts.

&quot;Oh, Nyamo! Don&#39;t stop! ,&quot; She begged.

&quot;Did I win the bet? ,&quot; I asked, pausing.

&quot;Yes, whatever you want! Just don&#39;t stop!&quot;

&quot;Only if you say it.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot;

&quot;You know.&quot;


&quot;Fine. I cum like a sixteen-year old virgin! Now start fucking me 
again, Nyamo!&quot;

Chuckling, I pushed my fist into her again and again, until her screams 
were incomparable. Her body spasmed continually yet she begged for 
more, I complied willingly. When she finally managed to say stop, her 
body was covered in sweat. Her long hair was matted to her face and 
some was sprawled around her head. It was a while before she could 
talk.

&quot;Okay, I&#39;m ready for more,&quot; She said. &quot;We have to compensate for all 
these years.&quot;

&quot;What!? We&#39;ll be here for months!&quot;

&quot;Okay, how about the rest of the weekend?&quot;

I glanced at the time: 10 am.

&quot;It&#39;s gonna be a long weekend,&quot; I smiled.
