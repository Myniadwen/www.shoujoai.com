<h1>Osaka and the Yellow Sign (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../azumanga/index.html">Azumanga Daioh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kriegsaffe.html">KriegsaffeNo9</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../azumanga/yellowsign-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Within the Occult Underground, there are three accounts of how the world 
will end.  One is that man will destroy himself in an orgy of violence, 
leaving the world a cinder hanging in the void.  Another is that the 
Great Old Ones will rise to sweep man from the earth.  The last is that 
the last human ascends to the Invisible Clergy and start a chain 
reaction that remakes the world.

Lately there is a fourth, oft-mocked, oft-feared prediction: that the 
end of the world will happen when the circle of girls who defeated the 
King in Yellow decide they&#39;re bored and go forth and stomp all existence 
to become un-bored.

There&#39;s no telling, of course; the end of the world is so massive, so 
impossible to predict, that speculation is merely a game of the mind.  
But those who are prone to knowing such things have placed substantial 
bets on the fourth, if only to cover their bases.

* * *

It was a moment that should have been immortalized in painting, 
photograph, song, story, and Broadway musical with a stage run that 
never, under all but the most obscene circumstances, ends; Kaorin taking 
a first step towards the King in Yellow, her sword borne before her, 
with Sakaki stumbled back behind her; Osaka with the Scythe and Book, 
hopping from the stage with a rare moment of perfect grace, ornate dress 
fluttering; Tomo looting gold from a collapsed shade, Yomi wrapping 
diamond-studded gold necklaces around her fist in preparation for a 
fight; Makoto shattered at the base of the grand clock chiming midnight; 
Izumi prone and weeping at the base of the stage; Jin pale, fearful, and 
on his knees, drawing the dagger of Eihnth-le-Homn.

Like all perfect moments, it ended.

* * *

Kaorin raised her blade in front of her, adopted a two-handed fighting 
stance.  &quot;I will destroy you, foul thing, or dispel you if I cannot kill 
you!&quot;

The King in Yellow slacked its arms.  You can no more wound me than you 
could slay the land with a dagger.

&quot;An invitation?&quot; Kaorin asked, the strangest little grin growing on her 
face.  The King in Yellow spoke (if it truly spoke) no more.  Kaorin 
gave her blade a trial swing, then ran, and lept, at the beast, 
screaming, &quot;First Melee Excellency--Essense Overwhelming!&quot;

She easily lept ten feet.  Her sword erupted into golden light, and she 
hacked the King in its chest.  It spiralled away, torn rags flying 
behind it, a terrible grunt/roar/howl burning the ears of all in 
attendance.  It caught itself, barely, though it stooped, and though its 
mask-face was expressionless it emanated fury.

HOW?

Kaorin, still in the air from her leap, floated back down.  &quot;It was a 
wish.  A wish to defend the one I love from a worm-god such as you!&quot;

The King in Yellow rose.  It has been far too long since I have faced a 
challenge.  Not since Nodens the Hunter twelve thousand years ago.  The 
rags around its arm tore, whirled, and black, taloned tentacles poured 
from the sleeves.  Yours will be a death well-earned.

&quot;To the death, then.&quot;  Kaorin performed a short weapons drill, ending in 
a one-handed battle position.

She lept, the King drifted, and the two met in midair, magic steel 
against a sea of fanged tendrils.

* * *

The King in Yellow and Kaorin traded explosive blows over the ballroom.  
Osaka tried to watch, found she couldn&#39;t keep up with the two as they 
stormed from one end of the ballroom to the other, slashing, parrying, 
and redoubling their efforts, blasts of (hey, why not) magic punctuating 
strikes like fireworks.

Tomo&#39;s pockets overflowed with sparkling trinkets; necklaces dangled 
from her neck, wristbands shone in the pale ambient light, and one 
gemstone-stud ring adorned each of her fingers.  &quot;Man, when I head home, 
I&#39;m so selling half of these and keepin&#39; just enough to look totally 
tits on the weekend.&quot;

&quot;Hbbbuuh.  HRARARRGH.&quot;  The chick rose to her feet, nearly foaming at 
the mouth.  &quot;Youuuuuu offal-sucking parasites!  I&#39;ll--&quot;

Yomi clocked her in the face.  She went down like she had the sudden 
desire to eat delicious ballroom floor.  The thin twerp slid up, had his 
fancy dagger ready, when Sakaki pelted him in the jaw; he joined his 
friend in getting a sudden hankering for floor.

&quot;That was pretty cool,&quot; Osaka said, tossing down the book.  &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll 
get to hit somebody soon.  It looks fun.&quot;

&quot;Man, I bet it is,&quot; Tomo said.  She boxed the air.  &quot;Man, they&#39;ll get a 
Four-Way Tomo Ringjob, that&#39;s what they&#39;ll get!&quot;

&quot;You know, smack talk is all nice and good,&quot; Yomi said, examining the 
bloodied jewlery on her knuckles, &quot;but shouldn&#39;t we worry about getting 
out of here before Kaorin, say, runs out of juice?&quot;

CRUNCH.  Kaorin jump-kicked the King into the ground, spiked into its 
chest, and sliced at its head with her overhuge sword.

&quot;I think she&#39;s doing nice,&quot; Osaka said.  &quot;She&#39;s a slishy-slashy.&quot;

* * *

Kaorin buried the sword (which she named Her Steady Golden Hand) in the 
King&#39;s chest, trying to find anything that felt like a heart, that she 
may stab it and end the battle.  The King uttered a word of command, and 
Kaorin was thrust off; she piroetted in air and landed on her feet.  The 
King intoned more words of might, and the shades danced, crawled, or 
stalked in waves around him.

At a final uttered word, they warped into great and terrible 
shapes--beings the size of men, equal parts vulture, insect, mole, and 
decayed corpse.  They groaned like old doors and chittered like 
rattlesnakes.  They smelled like a sun-rotted chicken exploded with a 
firework mysteriously stuffed with mildew.

The King gestured, and the murder took flight.

Kaorin centered herself, worked a spell-rote with her blade, and cried, 
&quot;Death of Obsidian Butterflies!&quot;  She held out the sword by its pommel, 
and from its shining jewel came a cloud of black stone butterflies, 
rustling like silver leaves in a fall breeze, and they shredded through 
the cloud of abominations as though their filthy bodies were sheets of 
paper.

When the storm ended, the floor was studded with broken obsidian 
fragments like caltrops, the King&#39;s horrors cut to nothingness, and the 
King itself nonplussed at the center of the storm.

If this is a show of magic... it said, I believe it is mine that shall 
carry through.  Squamous Blast.  The rags over the King&#39;s chest pulled 
apart, revealing a void black and enormous, like a maw.  A spark shone 
within the darkness like an exploding star, and a horrible scream echoed 
from the expanse in the King, like that of an approaching beast.  A beam 
of eye-searing light burst from the maw, accompanied with the noise of a 
choir of dissonant flutes.

Kaorin tried to parry the blast with her blade, but the spell&#39;s grim 
blast surged into the sword and into her.  She screamed; it felt as 
though she were being boiled alive from the inside.  She kept her blade 
in front of her, but it kept absorbing the spell, flowing it through 
her.

She had an idea.

&quot;Sakaki,&quot; she screamed, turning to look at Her, &quot;Please!  Throw me 
another blade!  I--&quot;  The blast surged again.  Her vision flashed gray, 
black, faded back into color.  Red began to tint her vision.

* * *

Sakaki froze.  Kaorin was screaming, though they were lost to the 
mounting, deadening flute-howl of the King&#39;s spell.  The others bent 
over, clutching their ears; Tomo was actually crying, overwhelmed at the 
sound.  She wasn&#39;t ready for this--wasn&#39;t ready to have to make a 
life-or-death decision; she mouthed meaningless phrases, saw the kid&#39;s 
dagger lie so close, but could she really throw it at her and expect--

Her eyes matched with Kaorin&#39;s.  Saw past the pain, into the need, the 
feeling that left trust eating fumes and came to a stop at belief.

She moved like mercury; grabbed the dagger with her left hand, juggled 
it to her right, caught it by the pommel, and threw it like she knew 
what she was doing.

Kaorin caught the blade, by its hilt; it turned into a sword just 
smaller than she was, thinner, like a stabbing sword.  Kaorin thrust it 
to the ceiling of the ballroom, and the energy of the King&#39;s spell 
flowed through like a completed electrical circuit.

The blast obliterated the ceiling, dragged its fragments up.  The bolt 
wavered through an alien sky and disappeared into the distance.  A few 
seconds later, one of the three moons hanging above vanished.

Kaorin fell, catching herself on her two swords, gasped for air.  She 
was smoking from the absorbed energy; her hair was singed.  She blinked 
away tears of blood.  The King in Yellow slowly reformed; in the 
deafening silence, Kaorin whispered, &quot;Thank you, Sakaki.&quot;

The King considered his enemy.  I was too hasty in dismissing you.  Yes.  
You truly are a match for Nodens of the Silver Hand... but though Nodens 
is great, even He could not withstand my Third Shape.  Come, then.  It 
rose into the sky, shedding its rags, growing, growing, growing...

It blotted out the stars.  That was all they could see.

Sakaki ran to Kaorin, grabbed her shoulder.  &quot;You can&#39;t, Kaori,&quot; she 
said, &quot;you&#39;ll...&quot;

Kaorin jolted.  &quot;You... You called me Kaori.&quot;

Sakaki blinked.  &quot;It&#39;s... kind of a serious event.&quot;

Kaorin smiled.  &quot;Sakaki, I have to.  If I don&#39;t, we&#39;ll be trapped here.  
We&#39;ll die here.  I can&#39;t let this happen.&quot;  Her hands left her swords.  
&quot;Sakaki, if I die, I just... want you to know...&quot;  She blushed--then 
lept up, threw her hands around Sakaki&#39;s shoulders, and kissed her.

She held it for three perfect, sublime seconds, and let go, her lips 
aflame, her soul rejuvenated.  Sakaki was aback, blushing, befuddled... 
but not appalled.  Not disgusted.  That was all Kaorin ever needed; to 
know she at least had a chance.

&quot;I&#39;ll save you, Sakaki.&quot;  She pulled her swords from the ballroom floor.

&quot;Hey, what about us?!&quot; Tomo cried.

&quot;Shut it!&quot; Yomi said, &quot;They&#39;re having a moment.  Cretin.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll save all of you!&quot; Kaorin declared.  She looked up at the mass, 
beheld a tiny white star that could only be the shining of the King&#39;s 
mask.  She lept, soared into the mass...

* * *

They watched her sail into the darkness.  Then golden light burst across 
the thing that the King had become.

&quot;Shine on, you crazy diamond,&quot; Tomo said.  &quot;I&#39;d like to take a moment to 
say a kind word about Kaori--&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not dead!&quot; Yomi said.

&quot;Let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;s a pretty sure deal.  Look at that thing!&quot;  She 
pointed, which was worthless, partially because most of the thing was 
shapeless blackness and partially because it consumed the entire sky; it 
was akin to showing somebody the earth by pointing down.  &quot;It&#39;s all... 
big and tentacly!  It&#39;s like eighteen Godzillas goin&#39; at forty Hedorahs 
and it&#39;s just as disgusting and confusing.&quot;

&quot;I liked that movie!&quot; Osaka said.  She sat on the edge of the stage, her 
scythe next to her.  &quot;But I was a kid, so maybe I just liked it cuz of 
the pretty colors.&quot;

&quot;Black.  There was a lot of black,&quot; Tomo said.

&quot;Black is a color!  And black can be pretty.  Lots of pretty things are 
black.  The sky... uh, not this sky, though.  The thingey-thing ... 
okay, maybe black isn&#39;t the best color right now.  You know what&#39;s a 
pretty color?  Periwinkle.&quot;

&quot;Good to see this place hasn&#39;t got you down.&quot;  Yomi unwrapped the 
jewlery from her hands.  &quot;Man, this kind of hurts.  I see why some guys 
just shell out cash for brass knuckles.&quot;

&quot;I just wish the guys didn&#39;t turn into turkeybug zombies.  We could&#39;ve 
looted so much more.&quot;

Yomi sighed.  &quot;I&#39;m happy you&#39;re thinking about finance when Kaorin&#39;s up 
there fighting an evil god monster thingey.  It&#39;s healthy.&quot;

&quot;Hey!  It means I&#39;m optimistic.  Is all.&quot;

&quot;After saying Kaorin&#39;s probably gonna die?&quot;

&quot;I was delirious--horrified!  But I&#39;m better now, as you can plainly 
see.&quot;

&quot;Sure.  I&#39;ll buy that,&quot; Yomi said.  &quot;Hey, Sakaki, you ready to meet your 
maker or...?&quot;

Sakaki stood alone where Kaorin lept, looking slightly down, blushing 
profusely.  She didn&#39;t seem upset or worried.

&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re... you&#39;re looking good.&quot;

* * *

Sakaki thought.

I just got kissed by Kaorin, in the middle of another world filled with 
monsters, before she jumped off to save me.

She looked up, watched as stars suddenly burst into being.  A distant 
howl.  Kaorin just cut off a massive portion of the giant god-monster.  
Sakaki stared.  Kaorin&#39;s doing all of this for me.  She&#39;s risking 
herself against something like this to ...

She blushed.

I love that girl.

But like that?  Really, like Kaorin loved her?

Her blush deepened.

Maybe I do.

It didn&#39;t sound bad.  Kaorin was a nice girl, after all.  And she was so 
sweet.  And she liked soft and cute things, too.

Maybe...

Another part of the sky was freed.

* * *

Up in the heavens, Kaorin danced from one giant tentacle to another.  No 
matter how many she cut aside, there were always more, until she hacked 
off a full part of the god.  Each decicive blow was won through 
countless near misses and last-moment parries.  She could feel the magic 
energy she burst into being with begin to ebb.  Her forehead mark had 
become a glowing brand, then an aura.  As she spent more energy, she 
could feel the aura taking the shape of something--something great and 
powerful.

She found a lapse in the King in Yellow&#39;s defenses, held her breath, 
closed her eyes, and darted straight down, swinging both swords and 
sending a shockwave through the horror&#39;s corpus.  Another hunk of the 
bastard separated, fell, and disappeared.  She was getting near its 
core, or what may as well ahve been its core--she could feel it 
radiating hate and anger like an unshielded nuclear reactor.

A gigantic tentacle slashed at her--she raised her blade, tried to parry 
it, missed by centimeters, felt a gouge tear through her side.  She lost 
her momentum and fell, not down but in, fading into the heart of the 
unspeakable god&#39;s mass.  Kaorin took a long, disquietingly 
clean-smelling breath, and held it as she was drawn in.

The flesh of the King in Yellow was pourous, clammy, and swealteringly 
hot.  Folds of muscle tissue formed eyes, rasping tongues licked at her 
wounds, vocal cords uttered blasphemies as she passed them.  She could 
feel the core of the King approach; it felt like it looked, a great 
black cancer running through the thread of the demon-god.

The mask-face it wore slid down the heart-thread of the god and stared 
at her.

This is where you die, little girl, Hastur the Unspeakable thrummed.  I 
have been undefeated for longer than your world has existed.  I will 
sunder the minds of your race.  You will be forgotten.  And you cannot 
stop me.

Kaorin grasped her swords, tried to thrust them into the core.

It is futile.  You will run out of breath soon.

She closed her eyes.  Thought of Sakaki.

She burned magic through her limbs.  Felt them press on, cleaving slowly 
through Hastur&#39;s mass.  She opened her eyes and saw the massive swords 
near the mask, near the vein.

Even now you struggle.  It&#39;s adorable.  The little girl doesn&#39;t want to 
die.

Shut up, she thought.  Her lungs burned for air, the god&#39;s voice was 
everywhere...

Sakaki needs me.  If I fail, she dies.

Her eyes burned with golden light.

She scissored her swords through Hastur&#39;s heart-thread, as if she were 
suddenly moving through air.

No...!

* * *

Kaorin&#39;s last burst of light faded nearly two minutes ago.  Much of the 
sky was still black.

&quot;Do you think she&#39;s alright?&quot; Osaka asked.  She&#39;d stripped of all but 
the bottom layer of her ornate dress.

&quot;I hope,&quot; Sakaki said, voice slightly wavering.

&quot;Yeah, me too,&quot; Tomo said, &quot;I--&quot;

Yomi elbowed her in the chest and whispered, &quot;If you say &#39;hate 
funerals&#39;, I am going to smack you in the face.&quot;

Tomo countered, &quot;Tell that to the Tomo Ringjob.&quot;

There was a burst overhead as though the sun had decided it was noon, 
moonlight be damned.  The King in Yellow&#39;s terrible shape was outlined a 
single instant, and then burned like a rag soaked in kerosine.  The mass 
fell, evaporating, until a single cinder smashed into the ruined 
ballroom like a meteor.

Falling behind it, alit by a great aura, was Kaorin.

She glowed like a hunter-goddess, bloodied and brutalized, but as 
glorious as a spring dawn.  The aura surrounding her suggested the shape 
of a great warrior-woman clad in armor.  Sakaki could scarce behold her 
for the brilliant luminescence of the aura... but she could&#39;ve sworn it 
looked like her.

Kaorin landed like a feather before the smoking crater.  From the hole 
crawled the King in Yellow, half-sized and clothed in burning rags, 
breathing--truly breathing--heavy and wounded.

&quot;You...&quot; it said, and it was truly speaking, not commanding in an 
otherworldly voice, &quot;are near dying.  I can see it...&quot;

Kaorin slumped, clutching an injury.  The aura flickered, disappeared.  
Sakaki ran to her, Tomo, Yomi, and Osaka close behind--Osaka holding her 
scythe and smiling her usual slightly vacant smile (rather disarming in 
this circumstance).  Kaorin gestured for them to halt.  &quot;You&#39;re not so 
good yourself.&quot;  She clasped the blades to her back; they stuck, though 
they had nothing to attach to.

&quot;One more chance, then.&quot;

&quot;If I win--&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll go to your rotting world.  Yes.  Killing you will be reward 
enough.  Your friends will perish soon enough.&quot;

Osaka closed her eyes and whispered something.

&quot;Then let&#39;s settle this.&quot;

Hastur bounded forward, raising great talons--Kaorin scrambled forward, 
swords still sheathed--

&quot;She crazy?!&quot; Tomo yelled.

&quot;Kaorin, you&#39;re--&quot; Yomi added.

&quot;SKRAAAAA--!&quot; the King howled.

&quot;Sea cucumber!&quot; Osaka said.

A hand-sized slug, presumably a sea slug, appeared an inch in front of 
the King in Yellow&#39;s mask.  It plopped on.  The King stumbled, ripped 
the thing off, and saw, too late, that Kaorin had the final blow.

She planted her fist on its chest.  &quot;First Stage of Raspberry Heaven&#39;s 
Penultimate Strike: A Thousand Fists!&quot;  The attack was aptly titled; the 
first punch presaged a thunderous storm of punches, the machine-gun 
crackle of sonic booms accentuated by a maddened battle-cry, best 
transcribed as &quot;Muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda 
muda muda!&quot;

The final punch sent the King in Yellow soaring straight back.  Time 
ground to a halt; the King slowed, froze in place; the world warped into 
an eye-burning red shift.  Kaorin could move; she drew her swords, 
proclaimed, &quot;Second Stage of Raspberry Heaven&#39;s Penultimate Strike: 
Sixgun Gorgon Dynamo!&quot;  She flicked her wrist.  She suddenly held three 
of each.  In card-shark-fast motions, she sent each through the frozen 
King.  Time snapped back, and Carcosa&#39;s dull coloration was returned.  
The king crashed.

It twitched.

The swords returned to her hands.  She snapped them to her back.  &quot;Final 
Stage of Raspberry Heaven&#39;s Penultimate Strike: Big Robot Dinosaur!&quot;

&quot;Wh... what?&quot; uttered the King.

&quot;Do what now?&quot; Yomi and Tomo chorused.

&quot;Oh, this&#39;ll be neat!&quot; Osaka said, jumping up and down like an excited 
kindergartener.

Kaorin lept, whispered a spell, conjured a gigantic animatronix T-Rex, 
and smashed it into the King.

She fell back to the earth.  The animatronic T-Rex faded away.  The King 
lay under it, thuroughly smashed.  She stood over the ruined body.  It 
was muttering.

&quot;Not... not the end... I ... cannot die... your world will end... I will 
tear it apart and remake it in the image of Carcosa!&quot;

&quot;Do that,&quot; Kaorin said, &quot;and I&#39;ll kick your ass again.&quot;

She screamed like an ex-convict con strung out on PCP laced with LSD, 
and smashed the King&#39;s mask in with her heel.

Shen she stopped they were back on earth.  The blades fell from her 
back, now a fancy dagger and a rusty shiv.  Kaori breathed, exhausted, 
and still heavily injured--but alive, and looking quite healthy, gaping 
injury aside.

&quot;Oh, man!  That&#39;s awesome!&quot; Tomo said.  &quot;The jewels are still totally 
jewels!&quot;

Kaorin leaned back and did something between a howl, a primal scream, 
and somebody mashing on an electronic keyboard.

&quot;WRYYYYYYYYYY!&quot;

&quot;Woah, cripes,&quot; Tomo said.  &quot;I think this diamond is, like, a crapload 
of carats.&quot;

&quot;Tomo, if I had the energy, I&#39;d smack you.&quot;  Yomi slouched against the 
wall where the magic door once was.  &quot;But man, I need something 
sugary...&quot;

&quot;Oh, you--&quot; Tomo began.

Yomi smacked her.

&quot;Hey, you said...&quot;

&quot;I make exceptions.&quot;

Osaka was still bouncing.  &quot;Oh, wowy wowy wow!  That was great!  I mean, 
except the scary parts, but Kaorin, you were so cool!  And 
lookitthescythe!&quot;  She waved the scythe.  &quot;I&#39;m gonna bring this to the 
school on Monday!  Or maybe I won&#39;t.  But I&#39;ll so take a picture!&quot;

Kaorin caught her breath.  Sakaki closed in, turned her around.  
&quot;Kaori... thank you so m--&quot;

Kaorin caught Skaki by her shoulders, twirled her down, and kissed her 
like in old romance movies.  She didn&#39;t come up for a good minute, came 
up, hyperventillated, and kissed her again.

Sakaki was as flush as if she had a fever.  &quot;Kaori... you kiss pretty 
good.&quot;

&quot;Just &#39;pretty good?&#39;  Need to practice.&quot;

She did.

&quot;Man, that looks fun,&quot; Osaka said.

&quot;Come on.  We need chocolate,&quot; Yomi said.

&quot;Hey, me too!&quot; Tomo said.  &quot;Think he&#39;ll take gold necklaces?  Maybe if 
we drag those two in there we can get a lez discount!  Hey!  You two, 
get in here and see if we can get a lez discount!&quot;

* * *

They could.

Tomo munched on a chocolate bar.  Yomi inhaled her third takoyaki and 
chased it down with her second canned ice tea.  Osaka nibbled on a 
bean-paste bun.  Sakaki and Kaorin kissed like kissing was the only 
option.  Ray watched.

&quot;I knew you kids&#39;d do good.&quot;

&quot;How long were we back there?&quot; Tomo asked.

&quot;Well,&quot; Ray said, &quot;you were back there about fifteen seconds before I 
hear this &#39;whooooosh&#39; noise, and then this one starts screaming, and 
then you guys came in and got some candy, and then these two came in and 
started making out.  So, yeah, about under a minute.&quot;

&quot;One minute of unspeakable horror, a lifetime of memories,&quot; Tomo nodded.  
&quot;And a cool freakin&#39; ammount of yen.  How much is these?&quot; Tomo asked, 
flashing her Ringjobbin&#39; hand.

&quot;Those?  As a former jeweler, I can tell you those are made of alien 
metals found nowhere on this planet, detectable here as mere blank 
slates unto which myriad interpretations can be juxtaposed.  No matter 
what you do with &#39;em, you&#39;re gonna get screwed over.&quot;

&quot;Aww, man!&quot; Tomo said.  &quot;Can that get me a courtesy bun?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Aww, man!&quot;  She paused.  &quot;What if me and Yomi started lezzing out, 
would that be cool?&quot;

Yomi jolted.  &quot;Tomo!  That&#39;s sneaky and underhanded.&quot;

Tomo leaned in closer and said, faux-sexy, &quot;That&#39;s not a no-oooo... 
c&#39;mon, Yomi-baby, let&#39;s make some magic... mweh mweh mweh!&quot;

Yomi laughed and shoved Tomo off.  &quot;Quiddit.&quot;

&quot;Nuh-uh.&quot;

&quot;Quiddit!&quot;

&quot;Nuhhh-uh...&quot;

Osaka smiled.  &quot;This bread is good!&quot;

Everything was right with the world, or at least everything that two 
weeks&#39; or so worth of convalescence could heal.

* * *

Makoto woke up to a ruined ball.  Multiple craters blasted through the 
floor and walls.  The roof was gone.  One of the moons of Hali was gone.  
The King in Yellow hovered limply, tatters scraping together around its 
cancerous essense.  Izumi and Jin were still unconcious.

&quot;What happened here?&quot; he choked.

Hastur did not speak.

Makoto sat, wondering what would happen when the King would awake.

He picked up The King in Yellow, turned to the first page, and read.

It was better than nothing.






End.


Bonus 4-Koma!

Yay, Internet
Panel 1: Tomo&#39;s at a computer, cruisin&#39; the web.  Yomi&#39;s over her 
shoulder.
Yomi: &quot;Whacha doing?&quot;
Tomo: &quot;Looking up that guy who took our picture.&quot;

Panel 2: Tomo&#39;s face lights up.
Tomo: &quot;Hey, now, I think I found &#39;em!&quot;

Panel 3: The image she found.  It&#39;s a heavily photoshopped image of the 
photo where Tomo gently bit Yomi&#39;s neck; Tomo&#39;s vamped up in 
over-the-top gothic clothes and sporting black wings and eye shadow, 
Yomi is faint and pale, and digital clevage shows from a now-torn school 
outfit.
Headline: LESBIAN VAMPIRE SCHOOLGIRLS MENACE JAPANESE SCHOOL SYSTEM!  
Violence!  Sorcery!  Frottage!

Panel 4: Tomo is understandably shocked.  Yomi looks pissed.

been crudely photoshopped into a giant castle.
Headline: EVIL SORCEROUS LAIR!  Black magic and vodoo!

Panel 2: Yet another.  Osaka the Black Mage dominates.
Headline: Powerful magician directs girl-hungry vampires to collect her 
concubines!

edited.
Headline: Lolita-Complex vampires induct innocent children into a world 
of lust and blood!

Panel 4: Tomo and Yomi.  Osaka&#39;s in the background, with her new pet 
scythe.
Tomo: &quot;Uh... sorry?&quot;
