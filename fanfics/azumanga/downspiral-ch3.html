<h1>Downward Spiral (part 3 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../azumanga/index.html">Azumanga Daioh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/paec.html">PAEC</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../azumanga/downspiral-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Okay guys, something I probably should have mentioned earlier, so here 
goes. I&#39;ve seen a few reviews and gotten some Email about Kaorin&#39;s 
reaction to Tomo and Yomi coming out. First of all, Kaorin is not a 
Lesbian to begin with. I don&#39;t have a link, but Azuma himself once 
proclaimed that NONE of the Characters in the Azumanga Daioh series are 
Lesbians. That includes Kaorin. Now, I don&#39;t know about you, but I think 
if the creator of the series says something about his series, then 
that&#39;s how it is. She looks up to Miss Sakaki, but the fact of the 
matter is, she&#39;s straight, and I&#39;m writing her that way. And now that 
that&#39;s out of the way, enough of my rambling. Let&#39;s get on with Chapter 
Three!



&quot;Guys...&quot; Yomi had a bad feeling at this point. She&#39;d expected initial 
shock, followed by the comfort that she felt could always be found in 
her friends. Tomo felt the same too, and swallowed hard. This was the 
variable in the equation that they&#39;d not accounted for, and sure enough, 
it changed everything.

&quot;Don&#39;t guys us, you...&quot; Kagura clinched her teeth, not elegance stopping 
her from saying what she wanted to, so much as the fact that Chiyo-chan 
was already confused enough as it was. Kaorin just sighed and shook her 
head.

&quot;I thought I knew you better, Yomi.&quot; Kaorin said, no sympathy in her 
voice at all. Behind her, the Train Scheduled to arrive at Platform B 
had finally come in, and the intercom was now calling for anyone 
remaining to board the train to Osaka. &quot;I wonder, if I&#39;d known you 
longer than Tomo, would it be me you&#39;d be trying to seduce right now?&quot; 
Then, before Yomi could even say anything, Kaorin turned around and 
walked away, boarding the train.

&quot;Even ah can&#39;t pretend to be okay with this one.&quot; Osaka replied next. 
I&#39;m sorry, Tomo, Yomi, but I just don&#39;t believe in that sort of thing.&quot; 
At that point, she too turned around and boarded the train, taking a 
seat by Kaorin. Tomo and Yomi could see the backs of Kaorin and Osakas&#39; 
heads, as they&#39;d taken window seats, facing away from the two.

&quot;How you two are content with yourselves is beyond me.&quot; Sakaki said. Of 
the very few times that any of them had ever seen Sakaki cross, this was 
easily identifiable as the angriest she&#39;d ever been, as far as the girls 
had seen. &quot;Come on, Chiyo-chan.&quot; Sakaki turned around, and ushered 
Chiyo, who was trying to ask questions, on to the train.

That left only Kagura.

&quot;You dikes!&quot; She said it, and this hit the two of them the hardest. Tomo 
looked on the verge of tears, and gripped Yomi even closer. It wasn&#39;t 
the fact that Kagura was saying it over anyone else, though that fact 
certainly didn&#39;t make it any easier, but the term itself, rather. The 
word was used as complete derogatory, nothing more. &quot;We had something 
going, you two! We were a group! A cliq, one might say. And now you 
throw it away for each other. I don&#39;t believe in lesbianism. Guys go 
with girls, girls go with guys. You two are not supposed to be this way, 
and now we have to explain to a child why!&quot; In the background, the train 
conductor could heard shouting his final calls for passengers. Kagura 
slowly began to back up toward the train, but her last words would hit 
the hardest. &quot;You two look at what you&#39;ve become, and then come to your 
senses. Until then, you can forget about associating with us!&quot; With 
that, Kagura turned around and boarded the train, the conductor closing 
the door behind her.

About a minute later, the train pulled out of the station, and though 
Tomo and Yomi both had tickets to attend this game, neither of them had 
moved an inch since Kagura had last spoke. At that moment, Tomo broke 
down, the tears only flowing slowly at first, but soon that slow flow 
turned into a proverbial waterfall of tears, as she stuffed her head 
into Yomis&#39; chest, crying away. Yomi returned the embrace, and just 
looked on at the now empty train tracks, her mind a total blank. This 
wasn&#39;t how it was supposed to be.

&quot;Wh...what did...we...d...do wrong?&quot; Tomo sobbed through the tears. Yomi 
didn&#39;t answer for what seemed like many moments.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Tomo.&quot; Was the best she could respond. She wanted to cry, 
oh how at that very moment she wanted to cry. But she couldn&#39;t. The 
tough, strong-willed facade that Yomi had always shown would still 
shine, she was determined on that. She would not show a weakness, and 
regardless of what happened, she would always be there for Tomo, and 
Tomo for her. At that point, part of her didn&#39;t care about the rest of 
them. Part of her mind cared for Tomo and only Tomo. Nobody else.

But for that other part, for the other side of the coin in her mind, as 
well as with Tomo&#39;s mind, the downward spiral had begun.
