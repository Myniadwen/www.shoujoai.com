<h1>Azumanga Nudist Colony (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../azumanga/index.html">Azumanga Daioh</a>

<pre>It seemed like just another ordinary day in Class 3. Yukari was 
teaching, Chiyo was studying, and Osaka was spacing out as usual. Yes, 
it was another day as usual until lunch. That was when it happened. 
Something that would affect everyone it our little group&#39;s 
lives...forever. 
 
&quot;Hey! Y&#39;all ever noticed how the only people who ever go to a nude beach 
are the only people y&#39;all don&#39;t wanna see nude?&quot; 
 
Yomi turned to Osaka, who had uttered the remark. &quot;That was certainly 
random.&quot; 
 
&quot;Yeah, but think about it. There ain&#39;t too many celebrity folk who&#39;ve 
just come out an&#39; said Hey, lookit me! I&#39;m a nudist!, right? I mean, 
Nakata did some half-naked drink commercials on the TV, but that ain&#39;t 
enough.&quot; 
 
&quot;Well, why don&#39;t we fix that?&quot; 
 
&quot;What?!&quot; 
 
All eyes fell on Tomo. 
 
&quot;Simple. We&#39;re all still young and hot. Why don&#39;t we go to a nude beach 
some day and break the trend? Having some hotties like us on the beach 
will beef up the membership for sure!&quot; 
 
There was a brief moment of silence before Kagura started laughing, 
thinking that it was a joke. &quot;Haw haw haw! That&#39;s a good one, Tomo! As 
if we&#39;d ever really GO to someplace like that!&quot; 
 
Tomo shook of Kagura&#39;s overzealous back-pats. &quot;I&#39;m serious, you guys! We 
could totally do that. And I think we should! What do you guys say?&quot; 
 
Another silence followed, but this one lasted longer. Chiyo-chan raised 
her hand tentatively. &quot;I&#39;m-I&#39;m not sure what kind of stuff you&#39;re 
talking about, but I don&#39;t want any strangers seeing me naked outside.&quot; 
 
&quot;Chiyo-chan&#39;s right, Tomo. We are girls, after all. Where&#39;s your sense 
of feminine modesty?&quot; Sakaki added, coming to the smaller girl&#39;s 
defense. 
 
 
 
Tomo&#39;s mind went wild. This seemed like a decent enough idea on its own, 
but she had a slightly different plan. For a long time now, Tomo had 
been crushing on Yomi secretly. That long flowing brown hair, those sexy 
glasses that showed off her beautiful brown eyes...those huge D-cup 
boobies... Her plan had been to get close to Yomi on this nude beach 
trip, and maybe even to tell her how she felt, but now... 
 
&quot;C&#39;mon! Whatta ya say, Yomi? Are you a big stick in the mud, too?&quot; 
 
The taller girl looked won at Tomo with a face that was hard to 
describe. &quot;This all seems so silly and random, but you seem to have your 
heart in on it, so I&#39;m in.&quot; 
 
One by one, the other girls started to change their minds after this 
announcement. 
 
&quot;Well...I at least won&#39;t take my clothes off right away, then.&quot; 
 
&quot;Me too! I&#39;ll go!&quot; 
 
&quot;Yeah, it might be fun to see how fast I can go without my swimsuit!&quot; 
 
&quot;Count me in, I guess.&quot; 
 
&quot;All right, then the decision is unanimous.&quot; 
 
&quot;Right! It&#39;s decided! Let&#39;s all meet up at the front gate of the Yuudara 
Beach this Sunday. How&#39;s that agree with everyone?&quot; 
 
&quot;YEAH!&quot; 
 
However, it wasn&#39;t until later that night that the girls realized, 
nearly all at the same time: OH MY GOD! WHAT DID I JUST GET MYSELF 
INTO?! </pre>
