<h1>Downward Spiral (part 7 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../azumanga/index.html">Azumanga Daioh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/paec.html">PAEC</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../azumanga/downspiral-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Okay guys, I know the story&#39;s been going a little slow lately, and this 
chapter won&#39;t be changing that. This will probably be one of the 
shortest chapters of the Fic, and it is pretty much just filler. 
However, we&#39;re coming up on a very eventful part of the story, so just 
bear with me, just like you have this far, and you won&#39;t be sorry come 
Chapter Eight.

This is Our Life

She didn&#39;t understand.

She knew it was going to happen. There was no surprise. Everything had 
gone just as she&#39;d predicted.

Why then, had Koyomi Mizuhara Jr. been so broken up inside when she&#39;d 
been rejected by her mother?

It was a mystery indeed, and as Yomi walked alongside Tomo Takino, her 
girlfriend, carrying with her a rather large suitcase, she remained 
silent. Every now and then, Tomo would try to strike up a bit of 
meaningless conversation, if anything, just to attempt to lighten the 
mood, get Yomi&#39;s mind off of what had happened. Tomo loved Yomi dearly, 
and it was painful to see her like this.

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s a pretty flower garden that that woman has.&quot; Tomo would 
lightly say. Yomi remained silent The two continued on. &quot;It&#39;s really 
humid today, don&#39;tcha think?&quot; Tomo tried again some time later. Yomi did 
not respond. &quot;I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s a new Jet Li movie out. Wanna go check 
it out later?&quot; Tomo was at the point of forcing out an answer, but Yomi 
remained quiet. Tomo sighed heavily, and gave up, merely walking over 
and putting an arm of support around Yomi. A few strange looks were shot 
their way, but when the onlookers saw Yomi, in her apparent state of 
depression, didn&#39;t think homosexual affection was at work, so much as 
friendly support. They were, of course, wrong, but right in a sense. 
Concern from a lover was at work here, and Tomo was all the more happier 
that attention wasn&#39;t focused on either of them. That was the last thing 
Yomi needed right now.

After what seemed like forever to Tomo, the two girls finally arrived 
back at the Takino Household, the house that would now be considered 
theirs. However, once they had ascended the wooden stairs, and arrived 
at the front door, the message they found in the form of a post-it note 
on the door didn&#39;t do this already horrible day any better. Slowly 
reaching up, Tomo, not even sure that Yomi knew where they WERE, pulled 
the Post-it from the door. As Tomo began to read, Yomi finally snapped 
out of it, so to speak.

&quot;Girls, I&#39;m sorry about this. I apparently didn&#39;t look close enough at 
my summon letter, and I got a call from my Battalion Commander wondering 
where the hell I was at. Anyway, turns out, I was supposed to leave 
today. I&#39;m gone, I&#39;ll be gone, I&#39;ll try my DAMNDEST to make it back for 
graduation this year. Anyway, Tomo, Yomi, I love you, I support you two. 
Don&#39;t let it get you down, and try to find the bright side. Believe me, 
there always is one. Love, Dad.&quot;

Tomo sighed. &quot;I guess this means...&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re all alone...&quot; Yomi finished. Tomo jumped, she was so startled, 
actually hearing Yomi talk again.

&quot;My thoughts exactly.&quot; Tomo draped her arm further around her lover, 
pulling her now from a mere arm-on-shoulder walk to an embrace, which 
Yomi returned by placing her arms on the small of Tomo&#39;s back. &quot;We&#39;re 
all each other has left.&quot; They were staring deeply into each others 
lives.

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Came Yomi&#39;s response, though this time, in a dreamy kind of 
sense. All it had taken was one look into Tomo&#39;s sincere eyes to know, 
know that somebody still loved her, and even though her friends, her 
father against his will, and even her own mother had denied it, Tomo had 
supplied it.

Yomi&#39;s above thoughts didn&#39;t even have time to process before the 
passion began.

Her mom had always taught her to go ten percent of the way, after the 
man came the other ninety. That philosophy was out the window, as Yomi 
brought her face foreward, not even giving Tomo any room to come half of 
the way, before their lips locked. After an initial lip lock, the game 
of tonsil hockey, if you will, began. Tomo would get a quick lick of 
Yomi&#39;s canines, before Yomi herself would tag back, licking the bottom 
of her lovers lips. Both girls constantly let out heavy, passionate 
breaths, and nothing, not even the very occasional sound of car horns 
could ruin this moment. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, 
they pulled away, both at the same time, and both looking like they 
could have enjoyed more very easily. As if to complete the moment, Yomi 
finished what she&#39;d started before the kiss.

&quot;...and I think it&#39;ll all be okay.&quot; The two exchanged knowing smiles, as 
well as a very tight hug, before letting go, still holding hands, while 
Tomo used her free hand to unlock the door, and Yomi using hers to carry 
her luggage.

All the problems in the back of Yomi&#39;s mind, the trauma of what had 
happened with her mother, and the surprise with her friends were still 
there, as they would be for the rest of Yomi&#39;s days, however many those 
be, and the same for Tomo, but both knew that they&#39;d done the right 
thing to get themselves started in the direction of the path that would 
prove right for them.

At that moment, they honestly believed that there would be happiness in 
the end.

&quot;Hey, if anything, we got our own place out of it.&quot; Tomo said, with her 
usual spunk now back in tact. Yomi chuckled at the fact. Only Tomo could 
find sunshine in the rain.

&quot;I can always count on you to look on the bright side, can&#39;t I?&quot; Yomi 
relenquished her grip on Tomo&#39;s hand, sitting her suitcase down near the 
staircase.

&quot;Look for yourself, honey.&quot; Tomo waved her hand as an advertiser would. 
&quot;Look around you, we&#39;ve got a fridge full of good food, HD TV, the bills 
and utilites being paid for by Dad.&quot; She let Yomi take it in for a 
moment. &quot;Surely to goodness we can still get work, make some dough, pimp 
this place out like we want it.&quot; Tomo took Yomi in her arms, looking 
straight into her eyes. &quot;Don&#39;t you see? It&#39;s all right here, laid out 
for us.&quot; Yomi smiled into the chocolate eyes of her girlfriend. She knew 
there was truth in all that Tomo said to her. This young woman would 
never lie to her. That was the truth.

But then, something else caught her eye. Something behind Tomo. Which 
caused Yomi to look up. Tomo, confused by the sudden distraction, turned 
her head, and saw it too. Yomi nodded her conformation.

&quot;We&#39;ve also got school,&quot; Yomi said, not sure weather to be grim in the 
sense of their newfound social life (if you could call it that) or the 
dread of having to go back to school itself, though her tone reflected 
both. &quot;Starting tomorrow.&quot;</pre>
