<h1>Azumanga Nudist Colony (part 2 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../azumanga/index.html">Azumanga Daioh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/meganeko.html">MegaNekoGekiLuv</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../azumanga/nudist-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Tomo noted with some satisfaction that the weather had become prefect 
practically overnight, almost forcing the reluctant ones to come. She 
stretched slowly and lay back against the main gate of the Yuubara 
Nudist Colony. Now, Tomo wasn&#39;t always the hyperactive moron she 
appeared to be at school. If anything, she was very introverted and 
pensive everywhere else. School was a place where she had gained a bad 
reputation, and was cursed to follow it. Absolutely none of her friends 
knew the real her. That thought made Tomo very sad. Maybe Yomi would 
grow to see her true self, if this worked. Her eyes closed as she lay in 
the warmth and waited for her friends to show up. 
 
Meanwhile, the others were steeling themselves up for what was to come. 
Yomi stood in front of a simple cloth tote bag, wondering what to put in 
it. &quot;Well, we&#39;re already committed to this, thanks to Tomo. What the 
heck was Osaka thinking, bringing something like this up? All right. 
We&#39;ll go, but there is no way in Hell that I&#39;m taking my clothes off. 
I&#39;ll just sit and relax, maybe read a book or two, and try not to stare 
at anyone.&quot; With a sigh of relief and finality, Yomi began packing her 
books. 
 
Chiyo-chan and Sakaki left from the same station on their way to 
Yuubara. There was a long silence in which both girls stood silently 
blushing at what was to come. &quot;Miss Sakaki? I don&#39;t think this is such a 
good idea, but I still hope everybody has fun.&quot; Sakaki smiled and 
nodded, feeling her own blush go away. 
 
Within half an hour, every member of our little group had assembled at 
the main gate of Yuubara. Unfortunately for this story, Tomo had fallen 
asleep waiting for them. Yomi smacked at her with a harisen fan (don&#39;t 
ask how she got it!) until she woke up. &quot;Dammit, wake up, Tomo! This 
whole nudist colony thing was your idea, wasn&#39;t it?!&quot; 
 
&quot;Huh? Wh-what? I wasn&#39;t sleepin&#39;.&quot; 
 
Yomi sighed. &quot;Honestly.&quot; 
 
&quot;Shall we go in?&quot; 
 
Wordlessly, the group moved forward up to the sign-in desk. There was an 
old man working there, who was thankfully fully clothed. Everyone&#39;s 
faces fell somewhat when he told them that they would need money to pay 
membership fees before they could enter. Dejected, the girls turned 
around and walked back out the gates in defeat. 
 
Yukari and Nyamo were out walking down the street from their local bar 
when they passed by the Yuubara gate and saw the girls coming out. &quot;Hey 
there! Hello, girls!&quot; Nyamo waved at them cheerily. She became worried 
when she saw their dejected faces. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; 
 
&quot;Those jerks over at the nudist colony told us we need to pay to get 
in.&quot; 
 
Yukari, fortunately for this story, was stinking drunk at the time. 
&quot;Aww, hell! Nyamo `n&#39; I&#39;ll pay yer bills, s&#39;long as we get ta go in with 
ya!&quot; 
 
Nyamo flushed. &quot;What?! Yukari!&quot; 
 
Yukari thrashed about like a drowning fish. &quot;C&#39;mon, Nyamo! I ain&#39;t 
takin&#39; no fer an answer!&quot; Nyamo proved useless in stopping Yukari and 
soon their bills were paid. Everyone swallowed deeply as they entered 
the Family Changing Room.
