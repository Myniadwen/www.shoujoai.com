<a href="../azumanga/nudist-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;WHAT?! You&#39;re in love with Yomi?!&quot; 
 
&quot;SHH!&quot; 
 
Tomo hastily shushed Kagura, who was always a little hard to keep quiet. 
&quot;Don&#39;t say that so loud. You&#39;re the only one I&#39;ve told so far, and I 
want to wait and tell everyone else once we get somewhere.&quot; 
 
&quot;But this is big news! Why do you wanna keep it secret?&quot; 
 
&quot;Oh, never mind! Anyways, I needed your help. I totally made myself look 
like a jerk in front of Yomi last Sunday, and I need your help winning 
her back.&quot; 
 
&quot;But why pick me?&quot; 
 
&quot;Because Osaka would just get confused, Sakaki would be too embarrassed 
to say anything, and Chiyo-chan&#39;s too young. Happy now?&quot; 
 
&quot;Yeah. Anyway, the first thing you have to do is secretly invite Yomi 
someplace where you&#39;ll both be really comfortable. Set the mood a little 
with some lighting or something. And, when the two of you are all alone 
like that...then you go ahead and tell her how you feel. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll 
forgive you, no doubt!&quot; 
 
&quot;Y-you really think so?&quot; 
 
&quot;Trust me! Don&#39;t forget, I&#39;m the one who reads all those dumb romance 
novels during Study Hall.&quot; 
 
&quot;Well, if you say so. This&#39;ll take some thinking.&quot; 
 
 
The next afternoon, Yomi walked up to her locker to find a letter 
sticking out through the flap. All day she had avoided Tomo. She used to 
think Tomo was just stupid, but...with that crazy stunt she had pulled 
at the nude beach, she now thought of her as just plain weird. The plan 
was to spend as little time in Tomo&#39;s presence as possible from then on. 
Well, imagine her surprise when the letter turned out to be from Tomo. 
 
&quot;Dear Kiyomi, 
 
I need to apologize to you with every fiber of my earthly being. My 
heart aches for the pleasure of your now-absent company. Please meet me 
at the Yuubara Nudist Colony this Sunday night at 1:00. I will be there 
with bells on (and little else, ha ha). 
 
Sincerely, 
Tomo Takino&quot; 
 
&quot;She actually wrote `ha ha&#39;?&quot; Yomi was all ready to throw the letter 
away, but then she read it and saw Tomo&#39;s intelligent wordplay. &quot;Maybe,&quot; 
she said aloud. &quot;I should give her another chance.&quot; She gripped her 
hands into fists resolutely. &quot;All right, I&#39;m going! And I&#39;m going to try 
and get naked this time!&quot; Too late, she realized that she was still 
standing in a school hallway filled with boys. &quot;Get those filthy images 
out of your minds, you perverts!&quot; 
 
 
Tomo stood, naked in the moonlight as she waited for Yomi to come. The 
tall girl with glasses slowly strode forth into the light, her brown 
eyes meeting with Tomo&#39;s. 
 
&quot;So what did you call me for? You&#39;ve got some nerve, calling me out to a 
nude beach like this.&quot; Yomi&#39;s face blushed a little bit. Tomo was 
curious. &quot;Why&#39;s that, Yomi?&quot; 
 
&quot;You of all people should know that, Tomo. It&#39;s because...I&#39;m so fat and 
ugly. You say it yourself all the time. How I&#39;m made of almost nothing 
but fat and how you always make fun of me on physical measurement day.&quot; 
Tears sprang to Yomi&#39;s eyes. 
 
&quot;Why do you do that, Tomo?&quot; 
 
Tomo felt herself beginning to tear up as well. 
 
&quot;B-because...sometimes it&#39;s easier to just hurt people than to say what 
you really feel.&quot; 
 
&quot;And how DO you really feel, Tomo? I&#39;m here. I&#39;ll listen.&quot; 
 
Tomo&#39;s face flushed beet red and she blurted out her confession before 
she even had time to think it through. &quot;Yomi, I love you! I&#39;ve loved you 
ever since we were in middle school together. Y-you&#39;re the most 
important friend I have, and I love you!&quot; 
 
Both girls blushed a little bit after the sounds of Tomo&#39;s outburst had 
faded from their ears. &quot;T-to tell you the truth, I almost didn&#39;t come 
here, but then...I read your words and saw a whole different side of 
you. I mean, you usually act the fool wherever we go, but you really 
have a brilliant mind and a way with words.&quot; 
 
&quot;I just act the fool, Yomi. A long time ago, everyone labeled me a 
troublemaker, and it was too hard to convince them that I wasn&#39;t. But 
I&#39;m tired of being something that I&#39;m not. I want to be a respected 
intellectual like you.&quot; 
 
&quot;Heh heh. Wow. I guess we really have a lot more in common than we 
thought, huh?&quot; 
 
Neither girl said anything. Tomo moved a little further away from Yomi, 
but it was only to wade out into the water. &quot;Hey, you wanna come on in? 
You know, catch up on what we couldn&#39;t do last Sunday?&quot; 
 
Yomi was in shock. The water droplets on Tomo&#39;s body almost seemed to 
magnify her womanly assets. The bookworm couldn&#39;t help but feel a little 
turned on. Maybe she and Tomo were even the same in their hearts. Taking 
a deep breath, Yomi gave her answer. 
 
&quot;Yes!&quot; 
 
Hastily, she stripped out of her shoes and socks. Then, taking a deep 
breath, Yomi undid the buttons on her shirt and revealed the same pink 
bra she had worn on their last visit. In one swift motion, she removed 
her skirt. Yomi was now standing there wearing nothing but her bright 
pink underwear and a bright red face. 
 
Yomi could feel her heart thumping in her chest as she reached around 
back for her bra straps. Closing her eyes and holding her breath, she 
undid them and let her bra fall into the ever-growing mound of clothing. 
When she opened her eyes and saw Tomo staring at her, however, she 
screamed like a little girl and hastily scrambled to put it back on. 
 
&quot;Dammit, I can&#39;t do it!&quot; 
 
Tomo waded out of the water and put her arms around the shy girl. &quot;Well, 
I suppose it was just too much to hope for. But that&#39;s okay. I&#39;m not 
going to force you.&quot; 
 
&quot;WHAT A GYP!&quot; 
 
Both girls turned towards the sound of Kagura&#39;s familiar voice. She had 
been waiting in the nearby bushes, along with all the other girls, as 
well as Miruchi and Yuka. Yomi&#39;s eyes flashed with anger as she noticed 
the video camera Kagura was holding. 
 
&quot;I go to all the trouble of bringing everyone along and staying up for 
hours past bedtime, and you two don&#39;t even kiss!&quot; 
 
The next thing Kagura saw was a pair of fists descending onto her face. 
&quot;Pervert!&quot; the two girls said in unison. Now that their cover had been 
blown, everyone came out of hiding, including a very naked Chiyo-chan. 
Yomi was surprised. 
 
&quot;Chiyo-chan, you too? I thought you and Sakaki were dead set against 
going naked around here.&quot; 
 
&quot;Well, Miruchi and Yuka talked me into it at first, but now I think I&#39;m 
really starting to like it. And Miss Sakaki is, too.&quot; 
 
At the mention of her name, the tallest girl in the bunch shyly moved 
out of the bushes, revealing her completely naked body. &quot;Here I am.&quot; 
 
Yomi seemed to snap at seeing Sakaki naked. 
 
&quot;DAMMIT! IF YOU GUYS CAN DO IT, THEN I CAN TOO!&quot; 
 
Running on sheer adrenaline, Yomi unhooked her bra and kicked her 
panties off to one side. She now stood completely naked in front of all 
her friends. The chill night wind made her nipples stiffen up and 
harden. Her bright red blush faded as some new sensation ran through her 
body. Yomi suddenly started laughing from all the different feelings 
going through her and ran into the water. Turning back to her friends, 
she waved cheerily. 
 
&quot;Come on in! The water&#39;s fine!&quot; 
 
Some time later, after the older girls had finished playing in the 
water, they lay just relaxing on some pre-provided beach towels. Tomo 
was the first one to say something. 
 
&quot;Y&#39;know, I was thinking that maybe we should come out here for summer 
vacation this year. They have little nudist cabins, so we could vacation 
without any clothes at all.&quot; 
 
Yomi thought for a minute, and then replied. &quot;I think I&#39;d like that.&quot; 
She moved in slowly to kiss Tomo, only to find that Tomo was doing the 
exact same thing. The two girls looked at each other awkwardly, and then 
laughed. This was going to be the start of a beautiful relationship.
