Reunion...?
-----------

The chief walked into the locker room, and all the officers instantly
stood to attention.

&quot;At ease, boys.&quot; he said.

There was a collective exhalation of breath that marked everyone&#39;s
transfer from tension to relaxation. There was also a rather pointed
cough. The chief looked over to the officer who coughed, a tall blonde
woman who still stood to attention with ironic stiffness, and sighed.

&quot;And girls...&quot;

The woman smiled at him, nodded imperceptibly, and stopped saluting. The
chief went over to the only other woman on the force, a short Japaneese
young lady with short but well-kempt brown hair and an energetic smile
that never seemed to leave her lips, even during the toughest
situations.

&quot;Tommy.&quot; The cheif said.

Tommy was the girl&#39;s nickname, well, one of her nicknames. She had
aquired quite a few, including Tom, Tommy boy, and, when some of her
colleagues had drunk to much, Tomboy. Her real name was Tomo.

&quot;Yes sir.&quot; The girl replied with her unmistakable Japaneese accent
which, while it had gotten less and less noticable over the year since
she came to England, was still quite obvious.

&quot;Do you know about an art thief known by the pseudonym Hananoko?&quot;

&quot;Yes sir. An art thief who has recently claimed responsibility for a
rash of skilled art thefts all over the world. Hananoko always sends a
red origami flower To the intended victim a few days before acting. Due
to the pseudonym used she is believed to to be a female of Japaneese
origin.&quot;

The chief nodded approvingly.

&quot;That&#39;s right. It&#39;s good to see some people take their job seriously.&quot;
He glared at several officers, who all quite failed to meet his gaze.
&quot;Anyway, This morning, this arrived at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, and
I thought this job would be right up your street.&quot;

The chief handed Tomo a crimson paper flower. Tomo unfolded it and read
the text within, which simply said &quot;You&#39;re next. - Hananoko&quot;. She nodded
somberly to her boss.

&quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

&quot;Good. I&#39;d really rather put more people on this, but we&#39;re understaffed
as it is. I&#39;m sure you understand.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir. I&#39;ll do my best, sir.&quot;

&quot;Good, I&#39;m counting on you, Tommy.&quot;

The cheif walked out of the locker room again, and the usual buzz of
conversation started once more.

&quot;Way to go landing all the difficult cases, Tomo.&quot; The blond woman said.

&quot;Better than what you get to do, Sarah. When did you last get anything
other than desk duty? Three months ago?!&quot;

&quot;Ouch. Good point. Well, you&#39;ll probably want to get to your new job.
Meet me at The Boot at six?&quot;

&quot;Sure. See you then.&quot;

Tomo walked out of the office and started walking towards the museum.
&#39;It&#39;s funny,&#39; she thought. &#39;It&#39;s been less than a year since I was
transferred here, and it feel like I know the streets of London better
than I knew the streets back home...&#39; She shrugged and continued
walking, and soon reached the V&amp;A museum. The doors where shut and a
guard was standing in front of them.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, miss. The Museum is closed for the time being.&quot;

Tomo flashed him her badge and identification. &quot;Tomo Takino, ICPO,
London branch.&quot;

The guards expresion instantly changed. He took out a walkie talkie and
said &quot;It&#39;s the ICPO. Open the door.&quot; Moments later, the door opened.

Tomo went in and was met by an old man who looked like he had been
worrying way to much lately. Probably the proprietor, Tomo decided. She
gave him a quick, professional salute.

&quot;Tomo Takino, ICPO.&quot;

The man nodded to her. &quot;Alfred Green, acting proprietor. I&#39;m  glad
you&#39;re here.&quot;

&quot;I trust you are taking every precaution?&quot;

&quot;Yes, of course. We&#39;re doubling our guard force and equipping them with
gas masks since Hananoko is believed to use sleeping gas to take out the
guards of buildings she steals from.&quot;

Tomo nodded. Of course, she knew that other museum proprietors had tried
the same defense, and it hadn&#39;t worked, but Tomo wasn&#39;t going to tell
Mr. Green that. After all, having a lot of guards around would make her
job of aprehending Hananoko a lot harder.

&quot;Do you know what she will attempt to steal?&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m not sure, but I have my suspicions. Just last week a private
collector lent us a rather famous Greek urn that we will have on
display here until saturday. It&#39;s value is estimated by experts at
around 40 million pounds.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like her style. Big, flashy, neat. will you show it to me?&quot;

The man nodded and led her through the museum until they got to a large
room with a single, central pedestal covered by a glass monitor. Within
the monitor was a huge urn covered in an equisitely painted pattern. It
really was very beautiful.

&quot;So, what kind of alarms are rigged around this baby?&quot;

There&#39;s a contact alarm that will go off if the monitor is broken or
removed, a pressure switch under the urn and a web of laser-alarms
throughout the entire room.

&#39;None of which will help you any if the power goes out, like it did
during Hananoko&#39;s last thefts.&#39; Tomo thought to herself. &#39;You really
have been sloppy.&#39;

&quot;Very well. Hananoko never holds acts on the night after she sends her
message, so you&#39;re safe for at least tonight. I&#39;ll report for duty here
tomorrow night.&quot;

&quot;Very well.&quot;

***

Tomo left the museum and looked at her watch. It was half past five.
&#39;Good&#39; she thought. &#39;I&#39;m gonna be able to get there on time.&#39; She made
her way down to &quot;The Boot and Ballbag&quot;, a pub traditionally used by
policemen. It wasn&#39;t long before she could see the sign with the vivid
representation of a steel-tipped boot kicking a leather bag with two
bulges on it. She entered and took her usual seat. The barman came up
with a pint of froothy beer and put it in front of her.

&quot;Thanks Jim. You&#39;d better start mixing a Mary, too. Sarah&#39;s gonna be
here any minute.&quot;

The barman nodded and went back to the bar. Tomo leaned back on her
chair and started sipping her beer. A few minutes later Sarah came in
and sat down next to her. Jim came up and put a Bloody Mary down in
front of her, then went back to the bar.

&quot;You&#39;re early.&quot; Sarah remarked.

&quot;You&#39;re not.&quot;

Sarah shrugged. &quot;You know how it is with desk duty. I swear to god I
should have become an accountant instead. There&#39;d be less bloody
paperwork.&quot;

Tomo snorted. &quot;Well, it seems your day sucked. Want to hear about mine?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think I have to. That self satisfied gleam in your eye means
you&#39;ve got this case in the bag, am I right?&quot;

&quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t say you&#39;re wrong...&quot;

&quot;Tsk... Full ICPO officer at 21, medal of recognition half a year later,
London record for most solved cases in 6 months... When are you going to
settle down?&quot;

&quot;The moment someone shoots me in the head.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m worried about. You seem to take unecessary risks all
the time...&quot;

&quot;The greater the risk, the greater the reward.&quot;

&quot;Now there&#39;s a proverb you learned quickly after coming here.&quot;

Tomo drained the last of her beer. &quot;It&#39;s a nice proverb.&quot;

Sarah motioned towards Tomo&#39;s empty glass. &quot;Want another one on me?&quot;

&quot;Thanks, but I have to stay sober enough to make a phone call at around
midnight.&quot;

&quot;Another one of your contacts?&quot;

&quot;Yep. I&#39;m gonna need a little help on this case.&quot;

&quot;So who is it this time? Your lesbian friend, your other lesbian friend
or your ex-girlfriend who, incidentally, is a lesbian.&quot;

&quot;Hey, you make it sound like everyone I know is a lesbian.&quot;

&quot;Of course not. After all, you know me.&quot;

&quot;Yeah? Well, I&#39;ll have you know my ex is bi!&quot;

&quot;Oh? I stand corrected. Now if you lower your voice a little maybe
people wouldn&#39;t stare at you soo much.&quot;

Tomo looked around at the people staring at her. &quot;You people got a
problem or something? Because I&#39;m sure it&#39;s nothing that a good punch on
the nose wouldn&#39;t solve!&quot;

Everyone turned their gazes away at once. Tomo had a reputation for
being a fierce brawler, and no-one felt inclined to test whether or not
it was deserved.

&quot;Well, if you must know, it&#39;s my other other lesbian friend, but don&#39;t
get smart on me.&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t dream of it.&quot;

&quot;Wipe that grin off your face. I hear your last boyfriend left you for a
guy, so you&#39;re not exactly one to talk.&quot;

Sarah&#39;s face darkened. This was not a topic she wanted to discuss. She
decided to slightly change the subject.

&quot;So, tell me about this other other friend.&quot;

&quot;Her name is... Ummm... Damn, it&#39;s on the tip of my tounge... Whatever,
I call her Osaka. She works as a practioner in traditional medicine. I
guess you could call her a herbalist, or something.&quot;

&quot;You have the strangest friends.&quot;

&quot;You should know. You&#39;re one of them.&quot;

&quot;Now who&#39;s getting smart on who?&quot;

&quot;Point.&quot;

And in such a manner, the night wore on...

***

The phone rang, and a tall, black-haired girl went over and picked up
the receiver.

&quot;Kasuga residence.&quot;

&quot;Sakaki? Been a while hasn&#39;t it. How&#39;re you doing?&quot;

Sakaki instantly recognised her friends voice.

&quot;I&#39;m doing well, Tomo. How about you?&quot;

&quot;Doing just fine. Love to stay and chat, but I have to talk to Osaka.
Urgent.&quot;

Sakaki put the reciever down on the table and turned in the direction
of the workroom.

&quot;Ayumu! Tomo&#39;s on the phone. She wants to talk to you.&quot;

A rather short, brown haired girl emerged from the room. She shared a
brief kiss with Sakaki, her fianc&eacute;, before picking up the reciever.

&quot;Tomo-chan?&quot;

&quot;Hey, Osaka. Long time no see. I need you to do me a favour.&quot;

Osaka nodded to herself. Tomo always wanted a favour.

&quot;What is it this time?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m searching for an antidote.&quot;

&quot;Antidote for what?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure, but it&#39;s something that can travel through the air, can
make people fall asleep from skin contact and originates in Japan.&quot;

Osaka nodded to herself once more. This was well within her area of
expertise.

&quot;I think I know it. I can mix up the antidote real quick.&quot;

&quot;Can you send it real quick, too? I need it in about 20 hours.&quot;

&quot;Sure I can, but these things cost. I&#39;ll add it to your tab as usual, I
suppose?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;d be great.&quot;

&quot;Your tab is getting pretty long you know...&quot;

&quot;How long?&quot;

&quot;60000 yen.&quot;

Osaka could practically hear how tomo did a double-take at the other end
of the line.

&quot;Ummm... Putting those matters aside, have you... Have you heard from...
her?&quot;

Ayumu&#39;s face darkened.

&quot;Not a word. Not since she finished university.&quot;

&quot;I still find it hard to belive that she just dissappeared like that.
Her, of all people.&quot;

There was an uncomfortable silence. There always was after these
discussions. And it was always &quot;her&quot;. No-one ever mentioned her name.
After a minute or so, Osaka cleared her throat to break the silence.

&quot;About this antidote... It contains some faint narcotic elements, so
it&#39;s not... Strictly legal. You&#39;d better be careful not to be caught
with it.&quot;

&quot;You know me. I&#39;m always careful. Well, see you later.&quot;

&quot;Later.&quot;

Osaka put down the reciever and turned around. Sakaki was standing
completely still and was staring into space with a depressed expression
on her face. Osaka embraced her fianc&eacute; thightly.

&quot;The silence... You where talking about... About her, wheren&#39;t you?&quot;
Sakaki&#39;s voice was little more than a whisper.

&quot;Yes...&quot;

Osaka led them both to the couch, as she sat down, Sakaki sank into her
embrace.

&quot;It&#39;s just... She&#39;s gone. And everytime I think about it, it hurts.&quot;

&quot;I know, Sa-chan. I know. We&#39;ll just face to have faith in her, is all.
She&#39;ll come back. Sooner or later, she&#39;ll come back. I know she will.&quot;

Sakaki nodded, but even so, she couldn&#39;t keep her tears from falling.
And Osaka just sat there, holding Her fianc&eacute; as thight as she could.

***

Tomo spent the next day at home, studying maps of the museum and reading
case profiles from Hananoko&#39;s previous thefts. At around 6 PM she
received a special delivery. She opened the package and followed the
instructions for use that Osaka provided very carefully. Soon afterwards
she left her flat and headed towards the museum. After a bit of arguing
she settled down in a spot of the room the urn was in where she could
keep a lookout over the entire room without risking to trigger any of
the alarms.

At exactly 11 PM, the power went out. Not just the main power grid, but
the backup as well, at excactly the same time. This meant two things.
Firstly, it meant that there was either more than one person involved in
this heist or the power grids where taken out remotely, by means of
rigged explosives or some such. Secondly, it meant it was safe to
assume the phone grid was taken out as well.

Tomo could hear the sound of numerous guards all running to get to this
room, and soon afterwards she could hear the thuds of quite a number of
people falling to the floor at high speed. Tomo, however just felt
tingly and a tiny bit drowsy. &#39;Showtime.&#39; She thought to herself and
readied her equipment. There was a scraping noise as one of the large
stone tiles in the roof was lifted out, probably done with the help of
some mechanical contrievance. The moonlight that filtered down from the
hole in the roof wasn&#39;t much, but enough to see by if you had good night
vision.

A silouette appeared in the hole and jumped down, its descent slowed by
a pair of wires fastened to its clothing. It touched down silently on
the ground, and then carefully lifted away the monitor surrounding the
urn. This was the time to act, Tomo decided. She sneaked up on the
figure, making practically no sound whatsoever. But when she got closer,
she got the shock of her life. She had grown a lot taller, and her
figure was a lot more womanly, but there was no mistaking those
pigtails.

&quot;Chiyo-chan!?&quot;

***

They both stared at eachother. A minute passed that seemed like an
eternity...

&quot;Tomo?&quot; The voice was different than Tomo remebered it, but it was still
recognisable.

&quot;Yeah... Small world, isn&#39;t it.&quot;

Chiyo nodded. She seemed rather dazed...

&quot;I must admit...&quot; Tomo conceded, &quot;This is not quite the way I had
expected to meet you again after all this time.&quot;

Chiyo sat down on the floor, and Tomo followed suit. This was rather a
lot for both of them to process.

&quot;You... You really did join the ICPO then?&quot;

&quot;Yes. And you... You did rather the opposite, I see. But.. Why, Chiyo?
Why thievery? It shouldn&#39;t be a money issue because, well, your family
is loaded.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not the money. It&#39;s not like I&#39;ve sold any of the things I&#39;ve
taken anyway.&quot;

&quot;Then why?&quot;

&quot;Because I figured out how easy it is. I went to university, I studied
physics, I studied biology, I studied chemistry, and suddenly I realized
how laughable modern security is. So I tested my theory, stole something
from a museum, and I was right. And that was when I noticed the thrill.
There&#39;s a rush in it. A sensation of glory and pride that you get from
setting up harder and harder challanges for yourself...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t get it.&quot;

&quot;I guess you wouldn&#39;t.&quot; Chiyo said with a small sigh. &quot;I suppose not
understanding the thrill of breaking the law is part of what being a
police officer is all about.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant. What I don&#39;t get is why you&#39;re working on the
wrong side. I&#39;m working for the law, and I get exactly the same thrill
that you just described.&quot;

&quot;I guess that&#39;s just how it worked out. It&#39;s a bit difficult to switch
sides once the game&#39;s started.&quot;

There was a number of groans that indicated the guards where coming to.

&quot;I really have to go now. They&#39;ll catch me otherwise...&quot;

&quot;I understand.&quot; Tomo quickly brought her hand up to Chiyo&#39;s neck, her
concealed stungun pressing against the girl&#39;s skin. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,
Chiyonosuke.&quot; She pressed the trigger, and Chiyo spasmed slightly and
then slumped to the floor.

***

When Chiyo woke up she found herself in a holding cell. She had been
frisked, she knew, because she could feel that even her more well-hidden
items had been removed. She wondered briefly whether it was a male or a
female officer who had frisked her, but soon disregarded it as
irrelevant. Her being in a holding cell, however, was not irrelevant. A
quick look around verified that there was no escape. The walls where
made of concrete, there where no windows and the door looked solid. She
settled down to wait.

A few minutes later, Tomo entered, a stungun in her left hand and her
right hand resting on the small firearm in the holster on her hip.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry about this, Chiyo, but I have a job to do, and you are wanted
by the interpol.&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s all right, I would have done the same thing in your position.&quot;

&quot;I want you to know I&#39;m doing all I can to keep you from getting sent to
jail. It&#39;s not easy, though.&quot;

&quot;Would it help if I told you where I keep everything I&#39;ve stolen?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Yes it would.&quot;

A brief conversation followed, mostly about various stashes and
hideaways, then Tomo left. Chiyo leaned back on the small, uncomfortable
bunk. &#39;So this is it.&#39; She though. &#39;Game over.&#39;

Tomo walked through the corridors of the ICPO building feeling part
angry, part sad, but mostly determined. She didn&#39;t want Chiyo to go to
jail. Not just because of their past friendship, there was something
about the daring, sly girl Chiyo had become that attracted Tomo in more
than one way. She had a plan to keep Chiyo out of jail, but she needed a
lot of friends in high places to see it through. Friends she didn&#39;t
have... But she knew someone who did.

***

The chief looked over the two girls. One of them an apprehended
criminal, the other his best officer, yet after reviewing some case
files he&#39;d noticed they both had a very similar modus opperandi. He
cleared his throat.

&quot;First order of buisiness today is to inform Chiyo Mihama of the
punishment to be given her for the multiple thefts she has commited over
the last six months. Although since she has, after being apprehended,
returned every stolen item to their owners, for which reason some
people&quot; he motined towards Tomo &quot;Would argue that it is more a case of
borrowing without permission than theft...&quot;

Both Tomo and Chiyo where tense in the extreme, and they both seemed to
be holding their breath...

&quot;The punishment for said acts will be 20 years of service as an
undercover agent for the ICPO. Welcome to the force, miss Mihama.&quot;

Chiyo relaxed, while Tomo let out a wordless victory shout and grabbed
her old friend in what would have been a bear-hug if there had been
anything even vaguely bearlike about Tomo.

&quot;I hope you realize how many strings I hadd to pull to get this done,
Tommy. Some of them I had to pull so hard they broke. You owe me one.
And as for you, miss Mihama, we&#39;ll be keeping an eye on you. One step
out of line and you&#39;ll be put behind bars.&quot;

Chiyo nodded somberly. Or as somberly as is possible while getting the
air squeesed out of you by an overexcited friend. After a minute or so,
Tomo let go of Chiyo.

&quot;As for the second order of buisiness. Tomo, I have good and bad news.
The bad news is that the higher-ups think your talent is being wasted on
this post, so you&#39;re to become an international agent. The good news,
however, is that it has been decided that you shall have a partner, and
that you are allowed to chose any, and I repeat, any, ICPO London branch
officer with equal or lower rank than yourself for this position.&quot;

Tomo, who had looked a little down when she heard about the transfer,
shone up like a sun when she heard the second part.

&quot;Want the job, Chiyonosuke?&quot;

&quot;Do I ever.&quot;

Tomo smiled from ear to ear and, without warning, gave her new partner a
kiss. Chiyo&#39;s eyes widened in surprise, but she then returned the kiss
with one of her own. &#39;All in all...&#39; She thought as she pressed her lips
against Tomo&#39;s, &#39;Things could have ended up a lot worse.&#39; The chief
merely cleared his throat and politely looked away.

The End.
