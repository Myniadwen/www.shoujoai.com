It took some digging and a bit of assistance from some of her father&#39;s 
business contacts, but Chiyo managed to get Kagura&#39;s phone number. It 
wasn&#39;t Kagura who answered, though, but a man speaking in crisp, 
professional tones. After a bit of perfunctory verbiage that sounded 
very scripted, he informed her that Kagura was not able to take personal 
calls at this time.

&quot;That&#39;s certainly to be expected. Would you please take a message? I&#39;m 
Mihama Chiyo. I&#39;m an old friend of Kagura-san&#39;s from high school.&quot;

He sounded it out, hopefully writing it down as well. &quot;Mi-ha-ma Chi-yo. 
Would you like to leave a phone number?&quot;

Chiyo had barely uttered the last digit when she heard the man squawk. 
Then Kagura came on the line. &quot;Chiyo-chan? Is it really you? Are you 
calling from overseas?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m in Japan. I haven&#39;t decided yet if I&#39;m going to go back to 
America or if I&#39;m going to continue my studies here.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re still a student? So you must be in graduate school. What kind of 
career are you aiming for?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m considering staying in college until I&#39;ve earned every degree 
that&#39;s offered.&quot;

Kagura laughed. &quot;If anyone else said that, I&#39;d think it was a joke.&quot;

Chiyo giggled. &quot;Kagura-san, I know you&#39;re very busy, so I won&#39;t keep you 
long. But I did want to extend the invitation to my summer house this 
weekend. Sakaki-san, Yomi-san, Tomo-chan, Osaka-san, and Kaorin-san are 
all going. I don&#39;t know for sure about Osaka-san&#39;s boyfriend, but he is 
invited. We&#39;ll leave Friday evening and return Sunday evening.&quot;

&quot;I appreciate the invitation. But I really can&#39;t. I have a photo shoot 
Friday and a competition on Saturday.&quot; She really sounded disappointed. 
&quot;And my manager is making hand signals at me. I have to go now. But I&#39;ll 
put your name on the special list, so if you call, as long as I&#39;m not in 
the pool or with a sponsor, he&#39;ll put you through.&quot;

&quot;Thank you. Good luck in your upcoming competition!&quot;

&quot;Thanks. Later, then.&quot;

&quot;Bye.&quot;

Yomi&#39;s senior colleague came into the back room. &quot;There&#39;s a young lady 
at the counter asking for you.&quot;

At the prescription drop-off desk, Chiyo stood reading a pamphlet on 
nutrition. Yomi hurried forward. &quot;Why are you here? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re 
sick!&quot;

&quot;Healthy as can be. I just wondered when you take your lunch?&quot;

&quot;In about an hour.&quot;

&quot;If I wait at the bookstore across the street, will you join me for 
udon?&quot;

&quot;Do you mean that restaurant down the block?&quot;

Chiyo nodded.

&quot;I&#39;ll come get you when I&#39;m ready.&quot;

Chiyo slipped the pamphlet back into the literature rack. &quot;Okay. I&#39;ll 
see you then.&quot; She waved, then turned and walked away with a cheerful 
bounce to her step. Yomi smiled. It was nice to see Chiyo in pigtails 
again, even if she tied them so low now that her hair draped on her 
shoulders.

Unfortunately, a rush of prescriptions kept Yomi from leaving the 
pharmacy until an hour and forty-five minutes later. She entered the 
bookstore, hoping that Chiyo hadn&#39;t given up on her.

Chiyo stood by the magazine stand, reading from the latest issue of a 
popular sports magazine. She looked up and smiled. &quot;Kagura-san is on the 
covers of three different publications! This one has an eight page 
article about her! It&#39;s amazing!&quot;

&quot;Last week, she was on five covers.&quot;

Chiyo&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Impressive. It seems like of all of us, she&#39;s 
gone the farthest.&quot;

Yomi winked. &quot;It&#39;s not a race, Chiyo-chan. And even if it is, it&#39;s not 
over yet.&quot;

Chiyo grinned, then put the magazine back in its place. &quot;Ready to eat?&quot;

&quot;What kind of question is that?&quot;

They headed for the restaurant. As they walked in the door, Chiyo leaned 
close. &quot;Order anything you want. It&#39;s my treat.&quot;

Yomi ordered her usual curry udon, super-sized. Chiyo went for katsudon. 
While they waited for their meals, Chiyo propped her chin in her palms. 
&quot;I haven&#39;t had a good udon since I left. There are restaurants in 
America that have it on the menu, but it&#39;s been modified to suit Western 
tastes.&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t be disappointed. I eat here at least twice a week. This is my 
favorite place.&quot;

Chiyo grinned. Then she pointed at her pigtails. &quot;By the way, does this 
make me look too young? Should I wear it loose instead?&quot;

&quot;You . . . are young.&quot;

&quot;But . . . nevermind.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with looking nineteen when you are nineteen?&quot;

Chiyo sighed. &quot;I&#39;m not sure I can explain.&quot;

Their bowls arrived, and they paused to eat. After several bites, Chiyo 
asked softly, &quot;Do you talk to Kaorin-san often?&quot;

&quot;We go out for drinks about once a month. She&#39;s the only person who I 
can get to sing karaoke with me. Why?&quot;

&quot;Does she . . . ? I mean, do you know if . . . ?&quot; Chiyo frowned. &quot;I have 
no idea how to ask this.&quot;

Yomi sipped her tea. &quot;Does it concern her work or her personal life?&quot;

&quot;Personal life.&quot;

&quot;Does it concern Chihiro moving out?&quot;

&quot;Not really . . . maybe.&quot;

Yomi adjusted her glasses. How much could she tell Chiyo without Kaorin 
getting angry? &quot;Did you know that the two of them were romantically 
involved?&quot;

Chiyo exhaled slowly, fanned her face, then grinned widely. &quot;Whew! I 
didn&#39;t know if you knew that, so I was afraid to get too detailed.&quot;

Yomi coughed. &quot;Well, if you knew, then . . . what&#39;s your question?&quot;

&quot;Did they separate because . . . that is, is Kaorin-san still in love 
with Sakaki-san?&quot;

Yomi nodded, lowering her voice. &quot;Chihiro knew she was the second-choice 
going into it. I think she had hoped that over time she would naturally 
slide into the first-choice position. It didn&#39;t happen, or at least it 
wasn&#39;t happening fast enough. So she did what she had to do for her own 
sake.&quot;

Chiyo was silent for a long time. She slurped up several noodles, then 
whispered, &quot;Does Sakaki-san like Kaorin-san?&quot;

&quot;I think she notices her even less than she did during high school.&quot;

&quot;Ah.&quot;

Yomi cleared her throat. &quot;When you described the people you dated in 
America, I noticed the common thread.&quot;

&quot;You did?&quot;

&quot;And so, I don&#39;t think you should hold back because of Kaorin&#39;s 
feelings. She will never approach Sakaki directly. And Sakaki will never 
notice her without a miracle.&quot; Yomi leaned forward. &quot;But Chiyo-chan, 
tell me . . . why did you want to talk to me about this? Why me over 
anyone else in the group?&quot;

&quot;Because in the e-mails Kaorin-san sent to me, she sometimes mentioned 
spending time with you. I thought that if anyone would know about her, 
it would be you.&quot;

Yomi felt her cheeks growing warm. She hoped the grin forming on her 
face wasn&#39;t too goofy. &quot;She mentions me?&quot;

Chiyo gasped.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Do you like her?&quot;

Yomi sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

They finished their meals, then headed out. Chiyo nodded in the 
direction of a cake shop. &quot;Do you have time for dessert?&quot;

Yomi grinned and cackled softly.

Within minutes, Chiyo had a sliver of raspberry torte, and Yomi had a 
slice of chocolate cherry cheesecake.

&quot;This is new on the menu! I&#39;ve never had it before.&quot; Yomi raised her 
fork eagerly, then leaned back, savoring the rich flavor. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s 
delicious squared.&quot;

Chiyo giggled. &quot;Can I have a little taste? I&#39;ll let you have a bite of 
mine in exchange.&quot;

&quot;Of course. You treated me, after all.&quot; Then Yomi lowered her voice. 
&quot;I&#39;m still thinking about what you asked before, about Kaorin.&quot; She 
glanced around, then leaned forward. &quot;Do you remember the athletics 
festival during our last year in high school? You and I were both 
cheerleaders.&quot;

Chiyo nodded.

&quot;Kaorin came over and talked to us for a moment. Not much. Just a couple 
of sentences. But she said that it was cute that I was a cheerleader. 
And then, just for one tiny, fleeting instant, she looked at me the way 
she always looked at Sakaki.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t remember that.&quot;

Yomi shrugged. Chiyo hadn&#39;t even hit puberty at that point, so it would 
have surprised her if Chiyo had noticed such things. &quot;That&#39;s the only 
time anyone has ever looked at me that way. But that&#39;s what I want. 
Whether it&#39;s Kaorin or anyone else, all I want is for someone to look at 
me that way again.&quot;

Chiyo nodded. &quot;Someone will, I&#39;m certain of it.&quot;

Yomi took another bite of her cake, then traced circles on her plate 
with the tine of her fork. A smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. 
&quot;Thank you for saying so.&quot;

-----

Chiyo walked Yomi back to the pharmacy, then went directly to the 
veterinary hospital. After explaining to the woman at the counter that 
she didn&#39;t have any animals with her, that she just wanted to see Sakaki 
and would cheerfully wait until she had a free moment, she took a seat 
in the corner of the lobby and flipped through a cat magazine.

It was quite a while before Sakaki came out. Chiyo&#39;s heart beat faster 
at the sight of her in a long lab coat, with a stethoscope hanging 
around her neck. &quot;I&#39;m sorry it took so long, Chiyo-chan.&quot;

&quot;I understand. You can&#39;t leave a patient, after all. I just wanted to 
ask if you had any free time tonight or tomorrow night.&quot;

&quot;Tonight I&#39;ll be helping at the zoo after they close. The lions are due 
for their vaccinations.&quot;

&quot;That sounds . . . dangerous.&quot;

&quot;After that zookeeper was attacked a few years ago, they&#39;ve changed the 
way things are done. It&#39;s much safer now.&quot;

Fear choked Chiyo&#39;s throat. She grabbed Sakaki&#39;s hands, noticing the 
many small scars that marked them. &quot;Don&#39;t get bitten! Or . . .&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right. Their regular veterinarian will actually be giving the 
shots. I&#39;ll only be assisting.&quot; Sakaki smiled. &quot;Besides, wild cats seem 
to like me. It&#39;s only domestic cats I need to worry about.&quot; She blushed 
slightly as she removed her hands from Chiyo&#39;s grasp. &quot;As for tomorrow 
night, all I had planned was packing for the trip.&quot;

&quot;Would you have time to have dinner with me? Maybe see a movie or a 
play?&quot;

Sakaki nodded. &quot;That sounds nice.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll meet you at your apartment at seven o&#39;clock.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow night.&quot;

&quot;Bye!&quot; Chiyo skipped out. Time to go shopping for a new outfit!

-----

From the moment Chiyo arrived on her doorstep, Sakaki felt underdressed. 
Chiyo&#39;s black dress with its rather revealing neckline bordered on a 
formal gown. Sakaki offered to change into something a little nicer than 
slacks and a pullover blouse, but Chiyo grabbed her hand and pulled her 
out the door.

They went to a famous restaurant far out of Sakaki&#39;s price range, and 
Chiyo paid. This place was sufficiently prominent that two members of 
the kitchen staff had been competitors on Iron Chef. Supposedly, 
reservations had to be made months in advance, but Chiyo could not 
possibly have planned that far ahead. Apparently the Mihama name was 
enough to open any door -- and to deter commentary from the waitstaff 
regarding Sakaki&#39;s attire. It was usually so easy to forget that Chiyo 
was rich. This was the first time Sakaki had ever really seen her show 
off. She wondered about the reason.

After dinner, they went to the theater to see, of all things, a stage 
musical adaptation of a television anime series from a few years 
earlier, which Sakaki had never watched. Very strange, surreal stuff 
about princes and miracles and sword duels. Lots of roses. All of the 
actors were female, even for male characters. It was interesting, at 
least.

Sakaki looked at Chiyo&#39;s profile, illuminated by the light from the 
stage. Her loose hair tumbled around her shoulders. The iridescent white 
stones of her choker glimmered like stars, as did the matching stones in 
her ears. In all four sets of earrings.

Chiyo turned and met Sakaki&#39;s gaze. Sakaki held it a moment, then looked 
toward the stage. Feeling Chiyo&#39;s hand come to rest on top of her own, 
Sakaki swallowed hard.

At the end of the evening, they took a taxi back to Sakaki&#39;s apartment 
complex. Chiyo asked the driver to wait, then escorted Sakaki upstairs.

&quot;Thank you for everything this evening.&quot; Sakaki felt very warm as she 
unlocked her door.

&quot;Thank you for joining me.&quot; Chiyo stepped closer. &quot;May I come inside for 
just a moment? I have something I want to tell you in private.&quot;

Sakaki nodded, then closed the door behind Chiyo. She started to remove 
her shoes, but Chiyo touched her arm. &quot;Here in the entryway is fine. I 
can tell you before you go in.&quot;

Sakaki stood still, waiting.

Chiyo blushed, then smiled, looking down. &quot;You can&#39;t go around saying 
that you&#39;ve never been on a date, now.&quot; She looked up suddenly, locking 
gazes. Then she reached up and interlaced her fingers behind Sakaki&#39;s 
neck. Sakaki&#39;s heart pounded as Chiyo pulled her down. Chiyo&#39;s lips were 
soft and warm and gone far too quickly.

Chiyo continued to face Sakaki as she reached behind her for the 
doorknob. &quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow night.&quot;

&quot;Tomorrow . . .&quot; Of course. The group excursion to the summer house. 
&quot;Yes. I&#39;ll see you then.&quot; She stepped forward, reaching for Chiyo.

Chiyo smiled, then slipped outside.

Sakaki stared at the closed door for some time, then took off her shoes 
and stepped up into the apartment. Maya looked at her from atop a 
bookshelf, swishing his tail. Sakaki brushed her fingertips across her 
lips. &quot;My first kiss . . .&quot; She dropped to her knees, then sprawled on 
her back on the tatami, laughing and crying at the same time.

-----

Sakaki arrived at the Mihama home first. She set Maya loose on the 
enormous lawn, then rang the doorbell. A few moments later, Chiyo came 
out. Today she was dressed down to normal, in cargo shorts and a 
Necoconeco t-shirt. The two of them stood facing one another, silent and 
motionless, for what seemed like several minutes. Sakaki felt her face 
growing warm, and she noticed that Chiyo&#39;s cheeks were pretty red, also.

Chiyo looked around, then nodded toward Maya. Sakaki turned and saw him 
sniffing around the roots of a big tree. &quot;That&#39;s the tree that he and 
Tadakichi-san always used to play under.&quot; Chiyo&#39;s voice seemed small. &quot;I 
wonder, do you think he remembers? Is he looking for Tadakichi-san?&quot;

When Chiyo had been a child, Sakaki had always comforted her by putting 
her hand on top of her head. Now that Chiyo was grown up, Sakaki 
wondered if she could still do that. If not, then what? Should she take 
Chiyo&#39;s hand? Hug her? Chiyo was still short, though. She almost but not 
quite came up to Sakaki&#39;s chin. Hesitantly, Sakaki raised her hand and 
set it on top of Chiyo&#39;s head.

Chiyo turned toward her and lay her face on Sakaki&#39;s chest. She slipped 
her arms around Sakaki&#39;s waist and sighed. Sakaki stroked her hair. 
Chiyo chuckled softly. &quot;You&#39;re petting me like a cat.&quot;

Sakaki quickly removed her hand.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t complaining.&quot; Chiyo stepped away, smiling.

A honk announced the arrival of the first car, so Chiyo hit the button 
to open the gate. A respectable white four-door sedan came up the 
driveway and parked, then Yomi, Tomo, and Kaorin got out.

Chiyo grinned. &quot;Now the only ones left are Osaka-san and, er,&quot; she 
hesitated, then glanced at Sakaki, &quot;Ooyama-san?&quot; Sakaki nodded.

Yomi pulled Sakaki aside and whispered, &quot;We&#39;ve got too many people for 
one car.&quot;

Sakaki understood. She kept her gaze on Chiyo, who was chatting with 
Kaorin. Behind them, Maya chased Tomo. &quot;Whatever happens, Chiyo-chan 
will be in your vehicle.&quot;

Yomi nodded.

Osaka pulled slowly through the gate. She had her new car, pristine and 
pretty, not a scratch on it yet. She parked, then got out and greeted 
everyone.

Chiyo looked inside the car. &quot;Isn&#39;t Ooyama-san with you?&quot;

&quot;I told him that this was just for girls.&quot;

&quot;But I invited him.&quot;

&quot;I lied. Actually, he has to work. So it ends up being just girls 
anyway. So it wasn&#39;t a lie.&quot;

&quot;Er . . . okay, then. So it&#39;s three of us in each car?&quot;

&quot;Or four and two.&quot; Yomi said quickly. Tomo was already in Yomi&#39;s front 
passenger seat.

Sakaki scooped up Maya, then looked at Chiyo. &quot;I&#39;ll ride with Osaka.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll go with you!&quot; Chiyo grabbed her baggage.

&quot;I&#39;ll go with you, too!&quot; Kaorin appeared by Sakaki&#39;s side.

&quot;That wasn&#39;t the four and two I had in mind,&quot; Yomi grumbled.

Sakaki put her hand on Chiyo&#39;s shoulder and guided her to Yomi&#39;s car, 
then turned her back.

&quot;But, Sakaki-san . . .&quot;

Sakaki hurried away. Within a few steps, she found herself face to face 
with Kaorin. Remembering that Kaorin was prone to carsickness, she 
decided to warn her. Wanting to avoid hurting Osaka&#39;s feelings, she 
lowered her voice so only Kaorin could hear. &quot;You should ride with 
Yomi.&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;ll go with you.&quot;

Sakaki looked at Osaka&#39;s car, then strode back to Yomi&#39;s. She put Maya 
into Chiyo&#39;s arms, then scratched between his round ears. &quot;Be good for 
Chiyo-chan, okay?&quot; Glancing over her shoulder, she saw Kaorin following 
her. Deciding that it couldn&#39;t be helped, she returned to Osaka&#39;s car. 
She suspected that if she got into the back seat, as would be her 
inclination, Kaorin would join her there rather than taking the front. 
So Sakaki slid in beside Osaka. Kaorin took the seat directly behind 
her.

-----

Chiyo looked at Sakaki and Kaorin in Osaka&#39;s car. Kaorin leaned forward 
as much as the seatbelt would allow, which almost put her chin on 
Sakaki&#39;s shoulder. Maybe Chiyo had more competition from her than Yomi 
had let on. Of course, with Tomo in the car, Chiyo wouldn&#39;t be able to 
talk to Yomi about it. But Chiyo wondered why Sakaki had insisted that 
they be in different vehicles. And what had Sakaki whispered to Kaorin? 
The rising anxiety made Chiyo feel queasy. She sank into Yomi&#39;s back 
seat, holding Maya on her lap. He stared intently at her face as she 
stroked his coarse fur. Then he stood up and placed his front paws on 
the window sill, peering outside. Chiyo&#39;s thigh hurt where his back paws 
pressed down with all of his weight.

&quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; Tomo shouted, jabbing her fist forward.</pre>
