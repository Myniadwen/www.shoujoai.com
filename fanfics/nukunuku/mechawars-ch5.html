<a href="../nukunuku/mechawars-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;Sylia,&quot; Priss said quietly, &quot;who is that lady staring at you?&quot;

Priss, Linna, and Nene had decided to stop in at the Silky Doll 
together supposedly to shop, but in reality to check up on Sylia. 
Things were awfully quiet lately, Genom laying low again after the 
&#39;angels&#39; debacle had been leaked to the public. Amusingly, it had 
caused a revival in Angelic Layer, but that kept Sylia from making any 
serious attempts to recruit the four Deus that the Knight Sabers had 
tangled with.

Sylia with too much time on her hands was never a good thing, so Priss 
and Linna decided to perform an intervention, dragging Nene along for 
reinforcements.

Sylia turned to look where Priss was staring, and she simply froze.

&quot;Sylia, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Linna asked, looking towards the strange lady.

The brown hared woman was looking around her with a bemused expression 
on her face. Dressed in an expensive business suit, she handled the 
frillies carefully, as if she wasn&#39;t all that used to them. Her hair 
was more than a bit messy, and despite being very well dressed she 
still managed to look just a bit scruffy.

&quot;Tony?&quot; Sylia murmured softly, a expression of shock clearly evident 
on her face.

It was barely a whisper, but the woman managed to catch it. She looked 
up, a shy smile on her face as she walked towards them. &quot;Hello, 
Sylia,&quot; she smiled, &quot;it&#39;s been a long time.&quot;

&quot;Tony!&quot; Sylia laughed, hugging her closely.

The three young women gazed at them in surprise. &quot;Who on Earth?&quot; Nene 
asked Priss and Linna, who both shrugged eloquently.

Sylia shook her head, &quot;Where have you been? It&#39;s been years.&quot; Her tone 
was amused, but there was just a bit of hurt in her voice, too.

&quot;It&#39;s a bit of a long story,&quot; Tony smiled sheepishly. She pushed her 
hair back, revealing short nails with a bit of grease still under 
them. A look at the three women watching them and she asked Sylia, 
&quot;Are there friends of yours?&quot;

&quot;Priss, Nene, Linna, I&#39;d like you to meet an old friend of mine,&quot; 
Sylia smiled as she gestured, &quot;Mrs. Antonia Stark-Richards.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Miss Stark again,&quot; she smiled a bit sadly, shaking hands with 
the three of them, &quot;and you can just call me Tony, everybody does.&quot;

Sylia and Tony obviously wanted to spend some time alone, so Linna 
quickly made up an excuse, dragging the others along after her.

&quot;Hey, I wanted to stay,&quot; Nene protested.

&quot;Sure was interesting to see how Sylia reacted to her,&quot; Priss frowned, 
&quot;I wonder who she is.&quot;

Linna gave Priss a disbelieving look, &quot;Stark? As in the head of Stark 
International, one of the biggest multi-nationals?&quot; She shook her head 
at her friends&#39; ignorance, &quot;If she&#39;s that Stark, then she&#39;s one of the 
richest women on Earth.&quot;



Tony looked around the apartment with a smile on her face. &quot;When I 
looked up your address, I certainly didn&#39;t expect to find a ladies 
boutique,&quot; she said. A soft laugh, &quot;I almost thought that I was at the 
wrong place until I saw you standing there.&quot;

&quot;I certainly wasn&#39;t expecting to see you here,&quot; Sylia smiled. She 
carried cups of tea over to the couch, gesturing Tony to a seat.

Tony sighed, easing herself down to a seat. She carefully picked up 
her cup, looking into it thoughtfully, &quot;You have no idea how much my 
father wanted to be here, for your father&#39;s funeral. They were friends 
for so long, it nearly killed him when he died.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot; Sylia asked. Tony raised an eyebrow, and Sylia 
continued, &quot;The press hushed things up about your dad.&quot;

&quot;He fell back into the bottle,&quot; Tony sighed, &quot;relapsed into 
alcoholism.&quot;

&quot;But, he was doing so well,&quot; Sylia looked honestly surprised.

&quot;I had to stay, help take care of him,&quot; Tony said softly. She drank 
some more tea, &quot;Knowing that you were here, grieving for your father 
all alone, I so wanted to come, but I just couldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;That was then,&quot; Sylia said quietly, &quot;but what about afterward?&quot; She 
looked up, meeting Tony&#39;s eyes, &quot;I could have really used a friend 
back then.&quot;

Tony set the cup down, &quot;It&#39;s not common knowledge, but my father never 
really recovered.&quot; A soft sigh, &quot;He&#39;s lucid, most days, but he really 
isn&#39;t that reliable any more. I&#39;ve pretty much been in charge of 
running the company for the past five years, or so.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Sylia sighed softly. She gently put her hand on Tony&#39;s, 
&quot;I wish you had told me. I&#39;d like to have helped.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve had your own problems,&quot; Tony sighed. A frown, &quot;I read the 
police reports on your father&#39;s accident. They&#39;re rather spotty, 
aren&#39;t they?&quot;

Sylia looked at her childhood friend, silently considering what to 
tell her. &quot;Very spotty,&quot; Sylia finally settled for reasonable caution.

A ghost of a smile crossed Tony&#39;s face as she said, &quot;You&#39;re holding 
out on me.&quot; At Sylia&#39;s startled look, Tony explained, &quot;Back when we 
were kids, you could never lie to me and it looks like it still holds 
true now.&quot;

&quot;I could never seem to lie to you,&quot; Sylia agreed with a bit of anger 
in her voice, &quot;but you certainly lied to me.&quot;

Tony flinched, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Sending me that wedding invitation, without even a word of 
explanation why,&quot; a clearly angry Sylia said.

Tony flushed. &quot;This obviously was a bad idea,&quot; she said, getting to 
her feet stiffly. She took a few hesitant steps, then swayed, almost 
falling.

Sylia jumped to her feet, steadying her, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Tony&#39;s face had gone pale, her eyes wide and her breath coming 
rapidly. &quot;I think I need to sit down,&quot; she managed to say, and Sylia 
carefully eased her back into her seat. Tony fumbled in her pockets, 
pulled out a small vial and swallowed a pill. She sat back, the leg of 
her pant pulled up, and Sylia&#39;s eyes widened.

This close, it was obvious that Tony&#39;s leg was artificial, not a 
boomer model but an older type of prosthetic leg. Tony pulled a bit on 
her collar, and Sylia caught the hint of a fiery red, newly healed 
scar along her shoulder.

&quot;Tony, what happened?&quot; Sylia asked, shocked.

Tony pulled down her pant leg angrily, &quot;It&#39;s pretty ironic, 
considering. A car accident.&quot; She took a breath, &quot;The driver&#39;s side 
was hit, pinning me inside as the car burst into flames.&quot; She forced 
herself up, &quot;I&#39;d better be going.&quot;

&quot;Wait, Tony,&quot; Sylia started, but Tony smiled sadly.

&quot;I didn&#39;t come here looking for sympathy,&quot; Tony said softly. &quot;I&#39;m 
staying at the Hilton for business in town the next few days. Maybe we 
can try lunch,&quot; she said hopefully. She walked across the room 
silently, and soon was gone.



&quot;What is it you want, Quincy?&quot; Tony asked him grimly.

The message had been at her hotel when she got back to the hotel last 
night, a tersely phrase request that she visit Quincy at Genom. Her 
first response had been to delete the message, but Genom was a 
business partner, and it never paid to piss off a partner you might 
need later on.

The gray haired man smiled smoothly, &quot;Why, I believe that someone may 
have infringed on one of your father&#39;s patents.&quot; He tried to look 
grandfatherly, &quot;I know how hard you work to protect your father&#39;s 
intellectual property.&quot;

&quot;Who, and how?&quot; Tony asked, suddenly looking much more attentive. If 
someone had acquired some of her father&#39;s weapons technology, the 
consequences could be disastrous.

&quot;The Knight Sabers,&quot; Quincy said, bringing up imaged of the four 
armored figures up on his screen. &quot;You&#39;ll note the similarities to 
some of your father&#39;s early designs,&quot; he pointed.

&#39;Not that similar,&#39; Tony mused. The basic solutions to building human 
powered armor were almost always similar in appearance, the simplest 
answers closely matched. But they triggered a faint memory, just out 
of her grasp...

Noticing that Quincy was looking at her curiously Tony said, &quot;Thank 
you for telling me. I&#39;ll certainly have our techs look into it.&quot;

&quot;I had our people assemble a data-file,&quot; Quincy picked up a disk, &quot;it 
might be useful to your people in investigating this.&quot;

&quot;No, thank you,&quot; Tony smiled. She got up carefully, &quot;I&#39;d prefer my 
people to start out with a clean slate.&quot;

She took a few steps away when Quincy asked, &quot;Do you think your agent, 
Iron Man, might be making an appearance?&quot;

Quietly, Tony answered him, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

The door hissed shut behind her, and Quincy gazed after her 
thoughtfully for a moment. &quot;Madigan,&quot; he said coldly.

&quot;Sir,&quot; she stepped out of the connecting room.

&quot;You monitored?&quot; Quincy asked. At her nod, he said, &quot;Keep an eye on 
her. I want her pursuing the Knight Sabers, not interfering in our 
operations here. Understood?&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; she smiled. </pre>
