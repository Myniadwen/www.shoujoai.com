<h1>Mecha Wars (part 8 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nukunuku/index.html">Super Catgirl Nuku Nuku</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nukunuku/mechawars-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>&#39;She knows?&#39; Sylia looked across the table at Tony, mildly stunned. 
The beautiful woman calmly continued to eat her dinner after dropping 
that bombshell, and Sylia sighed to herself softly. &#39;I wonder if the 
other&#39;s night out have been as interesting as mine?&#39;

MEANWHILE...

Nene sighed softly, wishing that things weren&#39;t quite so slow at AD 
Police headquarters. Not that she really wanted there to be trouble, 
exactly, but things had been so quiet lately! A little smile, at least 
the Knight Sabers have been busy.

She casually called up the files on Antonia Stark, browsing her 
history. &#39;I wonder what she wants with Sylia,&quot; Nene thought, then she 
grinned, &#39;other than the obvious!&#39; The way the lady had looked at 
Sylia, it was obvious that they had once been more than friends.

&#39;Why can&#39;t I get a boyfriend?&#39; Nene thought mournfully.

&quot;Nene-chan!&quot; a happy voice cried.

Nene looked up to see a pretty redhead bounding across the office, 
reaching her desk to throw her arms around Nene&#39;s neck. &quot;Nuku Nuku?&#39; 
Nene squeaked.

&quot;Sorry about this,&quot; Akiko pushed her short brown hair out of her eyes. 
It had a bit of gray, but other than that the business woman looked 
fit and attractive. &quot;Nuku Nuku remembered you were with the AD Police, 
so she wanted to see you,&quot; she explained.

Her co-worker was watching this with a great deal of interest, not to 
mention amusement. &quot;It&#39;s a slow night,&quot; she pointed out with a smile, 
&quot;why not leave for an early dinner? You can spend some time with you 
friends.&quot;

Nene hesitated, and Nuku Nuku smiled at her cheerfully, &quot;Please?&quot;

Nene looked over at Akiko with a smile, &quot;You mind?&quot;

&quot;Might be fun,&quot; Akiko smiled, adding, &quot;and I wanted to thank you, 
anyway.&quot; Nene grabbed her jacket and the three of them retired to a 
nearby cafe. &quot;I&#39;m sorry you got mixed up with our little Genom 
problem,&quot; Akiko said quietly.

Nene raised her eyebrow, &quot;Quincy isn&#39;t still causing you trouble, is 
he?&quot;

&quot;Beating up Boomers is fun,&quot; Nuku Nuku said cheerfully.

&quot;He&#39;s tried a few snatch and grabs,&quot; Akiko chuckled. She grinned 
across the table, &quot;Nuku Nuku&#39;s begun to look forward to them.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re almost as fun as Arisa and Kyouko,&quot; Nuku Nuku confided, 
referring to her former sparing partners. A waiter put dinners in 
front of Nene and Akiko, and a plate of sardines in front of her. 
&quot;Fishies,&quot; Nuku Nuku exclaimed happily, and began to scarf them down.

&quot;Cute,&quot; Nene chuckled softly.

Akiko watched Nuku Nuku fondly, an almost motherly attitude to her. 
&quot;It&#39;s hard to believe I used to try to destroy her,&quot; Akiko smiled.

&quot;What?&quot; Nene blurted.

Akiko grinned, &quot;Nuku Nuku was caught in the middle of my and my ex&#39;s 
custody battle. I had the resources of a major military arms 
manufacturer, and my husband had Nuku Nuku.&quot; A short pause, &quot;We were 
pretty evenly matched.&quot;

&quot;Having seen you fight,&quot; Nene smiled at Nuku Nuku, &quot;I believe it.&quot;

Nene turned back from Nuku Nuku and noticed Akiko looking across the 
table at her thoughtfully, a little smile on her face.

MEANWHILE...

Linna paused, looking at the new Angelic Layer gaming center. &#39;What 
the hell,&#39; she thought, going inside. She was pleasantly surprised to 
see a broad range of ages, little kids to adults.

She heard cheers, and moved through the crowds to one of the Layer 
tables. She had been into this as a girl, but had put it behind her as 
she grew up. &#39;Wonder if being good at this helped me be a better 
Knight Saber?&#39; she wondered.

A dark haired woman was playing, and it was clear that her opponent 
was vastly outmatched. The dark haired, kimono garbed Angel moved in a 
blur, delivering devastating blows. A smooth final strike, and the 
other Angel was flung from the table in defeat.

&quot;Hotoko and Suzuka win!&quot; a young man declared.

Another young lady stepped up, &quot;We&#39;re having a special contest today! 
Last a minute against Light Speed Suzuka, win a prize.&quot;

Linna hesitated, then she smiled as she spoke up, &quot;I&#39;d like to try.&quot;

A few moment&#39;s later she was &#39;loaned&#39; a lightweight model of Angel, 
and sat down across from Hotoko. The woman smiled, &quot;Let&#39;s both have 
fun.&quot;

Linna smiled back, &quot;Thanks.&quot; She slid the visor on, popping up the 
winds to activate the connection to the Angel in front of her.

&quot;Angelic...&quot; the young man paused dramatically, &quot;Fight!&quot;

Suzuka stood there, then she simply... disappeared. &#39;Just like the old 
days,&#39; Linna thought admiringly, remembering some of Suzuka&#39;s 
victories. She waited calmly, then the Angel reappeared in front of 
her own, struck, and missed!

There was a gasp of surprise from the crowd as Linna&#39;s Angel dodged, 
managing to tag Suzuka with her return blow. Hotoko showed no large 
reaction, but her eyes widened just a bit. &quot;Nice,&quot; she murmured 
softly.

Linna grinned back at her, then focused back on the Layer table again. 
Suzuka chased her relentlessly across the table, clearly demonstrating 
why she was a Angelic Layer champion. But Linna drew on her memories 
of their previous encounter, and kept ahead of her. Just barely.

But she could stay out of her reach only so long. Suzuka got her into 
position, coiled her body, and struck, the force of the kick throwing 
the other angel right off the Layer!

&quot;The rolling thunder kick, one of Suzuka&#39;s special moves!&quot; The 
announcer sounded awed, &quot;It&#39;s only rarely seen, and massively 
effective.&quot;

&quot;Hotoko and Suzuka win!&quot; the official declared.

Hotoko stood up and collected her Angel even as she smiled and said, 
&quot;But she did last well past one minute.&quot;

There was a collective gazing at the clock, which showed that the 
match had indeed lasted nearly a minute in a half. &quot;Congratulations,&quot; 
the announcer smiled at Linna while vigorously shaking her hand, &quot;No 
one&#39;s managed that today.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Linna smiled. She collected her prize, a deluxe kit for 
the creation of a Angel, but before she could leave a gentle hand laid 
on her arm.

&quot;Good match,&quot; Hotoko smiled.

&quot;I enjoyed it,&quot; Linna smiled, looking at the dark haired twenty year 
old.

Hotoko looked at her thoughtfully, a little smile on her face, &quot;I 
could have sworn we&#39;ve fought before, recently.&quot;

Linna blinked, not sure what to say.

MEANWHILE...

Priss toweled herself dry, feeling a bit of relief that the show was 
over. It had been a bad crowd, her and the band called in as a last 
minute replacement. The crowd had not been happy, and were quite vocal 
about letting them know about it.

&quot;Hey, Priss,&quot; her guitarist said, &quot;there&#39;s a lady waiting for you at 
the stage door.&quot; He leered, &quot;You finally going for the groupies?&quot;

Priss casually slapped him upside the head. &quot;She say who she is?&quot; she 
asked.

&quot;Owwee!&quot; he whimpered, rubbing the side of his head. &quot;No, she didn&#39;t,&quot; 
he sniffled.

Priss kicked him out, then changed out of her sweaty clothes. &#39;Wonder 
if Linna or Nene came out to see me? No way it&#39;s Sylia,&#39; she thought. 
She grinned, their boss in the Knight Sabers had been a nervous wreck 
all day, waiting to pick up Antonia.

She grabbed her jacket, deciding to keep her guest waiting. The lady 
had brown hair sprinkled with gray, obviously not Linna or Nene. She 
turned, and Priss slowed a bit, startled to see eyes the same color of 
red in her own.

&quot;Priss Asagiri?&quot; the lady asked quietly.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Priss asked suspiciously.

The lady smiled, pushing her short hair back nervously, &quot;My name is 
Natsumi Tsujimoto, and I think I&#39;m your aunt.&quot;

A moment of dead silence, then...

&quot;What?!&quot; Priss exclaimed.

Author&#39;s Note: I wanted to take a bit of a break from the ongoing 
&quot;Iron Man&quot; plotline, so... The first Meanwhile follows up on my Nuku 
Nuku Episode. The second is Angelic Layer. In the third Meanwhile, 
Natsumi Tsujimoto is from the anime, You&#39;re Under Arrest!
