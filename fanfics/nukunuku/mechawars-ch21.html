<h1>Mecha Wars (part 21 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nukunuku/index.html">Super Catgirl Nuku Nuku</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nukunuku/mechawars-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>        The Knightwing swiftly soared across the city, soon arriving 
at what appeared to be an old, long abandoned warehouse. A signal was 
sent out and part of the roof smoothly pulled back, revealing a 
concealed landing pad. They all disembarked once it landed, taking an 
modified industrial elevator down into the massive warehouse itself.

        On the outside it was abandoned, but within was a fully 
equipped headquarters. One part of the floor was broken up into living 
quarters, what looked like an armor repair/ upgrade section was 
nearby, several moto- slaves were waiting to be used, and a 
sophisticated computer center monitored the city of Megatokyo and 
Genom.

        &quot;I think I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Reika Chang noted, the normally cool 
brown haired executive looking around her in surprise.

        &quot;I set up several backup bases like this a few years back,&quot; 
Sylia shrugged slightly, still dressed in her suit of armor but 
carrying her helmet under her arm, &quot;in case of just such an 
emergency.&quot;

        &quot;You promised an explanation,&quot; Natsumi reminded her, the brown 
haired private investigator smiling slightly. &quot;We&#39;re all pretty clear 
on you four being the Knight Sabers,&quot; she looked from Sylia, Linna, 
Priss to Nene, &quot;But I wouldn&#39;t mind knowing why.&quot;

        &quot;Genom ordered the murder of my father,&quot; Sylia said quite 
simply. She looked a bit tired, somehow, as if the strain of the day&#39;s 
events were finally showing on her, &quot;Let&#39;s get out of these suits, and 
I&#39;ll try to fill you in a bit better.&quot;

        &quot;C&#39;mon,&quot; Priss nodded towards her Aunt Natsumi and friends, 
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what I can.&quot; Natsumi, Miyuki, Yoriko and Aoi all 
followed her over to a more private corner where the younger woman 
began to strip her armor off.

        &quot;Why do you do this?&quot; Natsumi looked over at her niece 
curiously, &quot;it seems like it would be extremely dangerous.&quot;

        &quot;Genom hurt someone close to me,&quot; Priss answered her crisply, 
&quot;someone I loved.&quot; She hesitated, thinking of Sylvie and Anri, &quot;Not to 
mention taking away a woman that I could have loved, if we were given 
a chance.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Miyuki offered softly.

        &quot;I got over her,&quot; Priss smiled sadly, &quot;but I&#39;ll never forget 
what happened to her.&quot; Her eyes narrowed, &quot;Or stop wanting to see 
Genom pay for it.&quot;

        &quot;Are all of the Knight Sabers driven like Sylia and you are?&quot; 
Aoi looked over at her.

        &quot;We all have different reasons for doing this,&quot; Priss 
answered, &quot;you&#39;d have to ask them.&quot;

        Reika reached over, carefully taking the green helmet in her 
hands. &quot;Can I help?&quot; she asked Linna with a slight smile.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Linna blushed a bit, reaching down to her sides, 
disengaging the locks and slipping free of the suit. She could feel 
Reika&#39;s admiring gaze on her leotard clad body and quickly grabbed a 
set of clothes out of a nearby locker. Matching green sweatpants and 
shirt were pulled on easily, slippers put aside for her feet.

        &quot;You&#39;re lucky green is a good color for you,&quot; Reika chuckled. 
They stood there a moment silently, &quot;Why do you put yourself at risk 
like this?&quot;

        Linna smiled a bit wryly. &quot;For money, originally,&quot; Linna 
admitted, &quot;Sylia paid very well, and I knew the risks.&quot; She looked 
over at Reika, &quot;Then was targeted, and it all stopped being a game for 
me.&quot; A short pause, &quot;Then I met you.&quot;

        Reika leaned forward, gently pressing her lips to the startled 
Linna&#39;s. &quot;When we met, things changed for me as well,&quot; she said softly 
before they headed back to the others.

        &quot;I meant to tell you about this after the party tonight,&quot; Nene 
admitted sheepishly, standing by Akiko, Nuku Nuku and Emi in a pink 
sweatsuit.

        &quot;I can&#39;t say I&#39;m happy about the danger it puts you in,&quot; Akiko 
admitted, the older woman taking Nene&#39;s hand and squeezing gently, 
&quot;but I understand.&quot;

        &quot;Can we help you thrash boomers?&quot; Nuku Nuku asked eagerly.

        &quot;Yeah, can we?&quot; Emi bounced happily.

        Nene had to laugh, &quot;You&#39;ll just have to ask Sylia, all right?&quot;

        Not far away Antonia Stark gave Biko a slightly rueful smile. 
&quot;I didn&#39;t intend to get the two of you involved with this, Cousin,&quot; 
Tony shrugged.

        &quot;I&#39;m glad that we are,&quot; Biko smiled, &quot;it gives me the 
opportunity to avenge the employees of my fathers company that were 
killed by Boomers.&quot; The blue haired woman threw her head back 
dramatically, while keeping close to her redheaded companion.

        Aiko nodded firmly, &quot;And I&#39;m sure my father would expect me to 
help out.&quot;

        Tony folded away the rest of her armor, packing it all away in 
the silvery suitcase she always kept with her. &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Tony sighed 
softly, &quot;because I think we might need your help again before this is 
all through.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;re in,&quot; Biko nodded firmly, Aiko joining in.

        &quot;I wanted to apologize,&quot; Linna walked over to smile shyly at 
Misaki, Hotoko, Sai and Kaede. She took a breath before she started to 
explain to the Angelic Layer Deus, &quot;I didn&#39;t actually know what Sylia 
had planned, but...&quot;

        Misaki beamed, her boyishly short brown hair a bit messy with 
her enthusiasm, &quot;Sylia let us operate life-sized Angels again!&quot;

        &quot;Near enough, anyway,&quot; Hotoko grinned, taking her shorter 
lover&#39;s hand. The black haired broadcaster added, &quot;It wasn&#39;t my 
Suzuka, but certainly good enough.&quot;

        Kaede smiled gently at Linna, &quot;Besides which, you couldn&#39;t 
have known that boomers would attack the party and force the 
activation of the Saber Dolls.&quot;

        &quot;And it was a hell of a fight,&quot; Sai added seriously. &quot;I 
wouldn&#39;t say it was better than Angelic Layer,&quot; she smiled suddenly, 
&quot;but it was close!&quot;

        &quot;See,&quot; Reika chided Linna gently, &quot;they aren&#39;t even upset.&quot;

        Kaede looked at Linna thoughtfully. &quot;By the way,&quot; she said 
innocently, &quot;is that a new shade of lipstick you&#39;re wearing?&quot;

        Linna went beet red, realizing that some of Reika&#39;s lipstick 
had come off on her own lips.

        Sylia Stingray emerged, dressed in her own set of gray 
sweatpants with a slight smile on her face. &#39;I&#39;m glad to see things 
going so well,&#39; she thought, having listened in covertly to the 
various conversations that were going on.

        &quot;Ladies and gentleman,&quot; Sylia nodded to Mackie, &quot;we have much 
to discuss.&quot; She hit a switch, opening up a spacious meeting room just 
off from the suites, &quot;We&#39;ll be more comfortable doing that in here, I 
think.&quot;

        The mob filed in, surprisingly finding spaces for everyone to 
sit. Linna looked around her thoughtfully, &#39;Did Sylia actually plan to 
raise an army, or did she just expect to acquire allies?&#39;

        &quot;All right Sylia,&quot; Priss stood up from her seat to ask, &quot;why 
were the Boomers out to kill you, and not the Knight Sabers?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m going to need to do a bit of a lead in before I answer 
that,&quot; Sylia said just a bit apologetically. &quot;You know my father 
helped invent the Boomer, and that his designs would have produced a 
safe, efficient model of Boomers.&quot;

        &quot;Unlike Genom&#39;s models,&quot; Akiko said dryly.

        &quot;Genom built a cut-rate model instead,&quot; Sylia explained 
grimly. &quot;My intention has been to provide a balance to Quincy&#39;s 
criminal actions while hoping that he would be displaced from Genom&#39;s 
board. Seeing no progress on that front, I resolved to remove him 
myself.&quot;

        Reika nodded thoughtfully, &quot;You&#39;ve been buying up Genom&#39;s 
stock, trying to get enough to oust him from the board.&quot;

        &quot;And I used shell companies to conceal those purchases, to 
keep Quincy from tracing it back to me,&quot; Sylia agreed. She frowned, &quot;I 
must have gotten sloppy somewhere, because it appears he has realized 
I have the stock.&quot;

        &quot;Then the shareholder meeting must be pretty soon, to have 
Quincy try something this bold,&quot; a frowning Nene noted.

        Sylia took a casual look at her watch before saying, &quot;Since 
it&#39;s just past midnight, the shareholder&#39;s meeting is tomorrow 
evening.&quot;

        &quot;So all you have to do is vote with your shares and Quincy&#39;s 
gone?&quot; Linna sat up in surprise.

        &quot;It&#39;s not quite that simple,&quot; Tony sighed.

        Sylia nodded grimly, &quot;The regulations that Genom set up are 
quite explicit. To vote Quincy out, I&#39;m going to have to be there in 
person.&quot;

        &quot;Which means that Quincy is going to throw everything he has 
left at you to keep you from attending the meeting,&quot; Natsumi noted.

        &quot;Then I guess we&#39;ll just have to make sure you get there,&quot; 
Aiko said casually, the room filling with murmurs of agreement.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Sylia smiled.


        Quincy had his eyes closed, his face surprisingly pale, and 
Madigan didn&#39;t look much better. The wiping out of one hundred Boomers 
was bad enough, but their complete failure to eliminate Sylia Stingray 
was possibly even worse.

        &quot;We need to prevent her from reaching the meeting,&quot; Madigan 
said unnecessarily.

        &quot;We mobilize all the available Boomers,&quot; Quincy said grimly. 
He paused, &quot;And I want the combat models used as well.&quot;

        &quot;Sir,&quot; Madigan looked at him in alarm, &quot;you know that use of 
combat models in Japan is clearly prohibited! If we&#39;re caught..&quot;

        &quot;The possible consequences won&#39;t be any worse than if Sylia 
succeeds in ousting me,&quot; Quincy said to her grimly.

        Madigan nodded thoughtfully, &quot;Understood sir, I&#39;ll set things 
in motion.&quot;

        The office was quiet as Madigan left, her mind occupied with 
her own thoughts. &#39;If Quincy goes down, he&#39;ll take me with him,&#39; she 
thought grimly. A cold little smile, &#39;Then I guess I need to make sure 
that doesn&#39;t happen.&#39;
