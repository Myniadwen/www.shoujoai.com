------------------------------------------------------------

Darkness...

Then something, almost inaudible, as if a distant voice was calling her 
back. She strained to hear it, but that seemed to make it fade further, 
her tired mind vainly reaching out to it. Moments before she lapsed back 
into unconsciousness, she heard it again.

&quot;Haruka...&quot;

--------------------

Slowly she opened her eyes, the light flooding in instantly and blinding 
her. She winced, slowly allowing her eyes to get used to the glare. 
Gradually, fuzzy shapes swayed into focus. Bare white, sterile walls 
stared back at her, the sun-bleached bareness punctuated only by the 
vase of yellow carnations perched rather precariously on the windowsill, 
swaying gently in the breeze from the open window. Haruka closed her 
eyes and smiled. Akane must have been in earlier to change the flowers. 
She&#39;d always hated carnations, but it seemed that her stubborn younger 
sister had forsaken her own tastes for once.

Haruka relaxed back into her pillow and allowed a wan smile to creep 
back across her face. She was still in the hospital. Letting her mind 
drift for a moment, an image formed from out of the fog. She was sitting 
in this bed and...and Takayuki had come to visit her...there were bunches 
of flowers...Akane had been there too. In her mind&#39;s eye she wandered 
across the scene, astonished at the turnout, all these people suddenly 
paying attention to her, congratulating her...and in the corner, someone 
had hidden themselves behind a large bunch of tulips. She remembered 
every detail; the slight blush that rose to her face when their gazes 
met; how she almost ducked back behind her flowers; the way her hair 
glowed orange in the fading light when she flicked it out of her face to 
greet her; the divine sing-song of her voice. A voice she had waited 
three years to hear again. 

&quot;Three years!&quot; Akane&#39;s voice rang out urgently in her mind with such a 
ferocity her eyes jerked open, &quot;Onee-chan, you&#39;ve been asleep for three 
years!&quot; A hot tear made its way down Haruka&#39;s drawn cheeks and hung, 
hesitating for a second before being wiped away by a shaking hand. Had 
it really been three years? The tears flowed more freely now, some 
escaping the furious swipe from the sleeve of her hospital gown, causing 
tiny grey damp patches on the white starched linen. 

Wiping the last of the tears away, she took in the room again. The 
yellow carnations winked back at her, rustling slightly in the breeze. 
The draught from the window playing gently over her flushed skin, Haruka 
relaxed a little, and idly wondered how everyone was doing. She wondered 
if Takayuki had found another girl in three years...and if Akane had 
found anyone who could put up with her stubbornness long enough to 
actually get to know her. As her mind drifted, her right hand wandered 
over the sheets, which, oddly, felt a bit like hair.

&quot;Hair?&quot;

Haruka spun round in surprise, only to be greeted by the sight of a huge 
tangled mass of blue hair. Somehow, it seemed in some way to be 
connected to a sprawled out pinstripe business suit balanced perilously 
between the bed and a hospital issue fold-out chair. She poked it. It 
groaned a little and shuffled away. She poked it again. &quot;Mitsuki-chan!&quot; 

The blue-haired object jerked awake so suddenly that the perfect balance 
between chair and bed was catastrophically destroyed, sending both chair 
and business suit tumbling spectacularly to the floor in a heap.

&quot;It....te!&quot; exclaimed Mitsuki, who was vainly trying to clear the tangled 
mass out of her eyes. &quot;Geez, you should know better than to scare people 
like that when they&#39;re sleeping, Haruka-chan...&quot; Mitsuki paused as she 
looked up at her friend, who looked like she was about to pass out from 
fits of laughter. &quot;Haruka! You&#39;re awake!&quot; Mitsuki sprung up from the 
floor with alarming agility to pounce on Haruka&#39;s sniggering figure with 
a bone-crushing hug. 

&quot;Mitsuki, I...can&#39;t...breathe,&quot; gasped Haruka, still laughing. The taller 
girl&#39;s grip slightly lessened as Mitsuki buried her head in her red hair 
and sobbed. 

&quot;Mitsuki-chan,&quot; Haruka whispered.

&quot;W...we...thought you&#39;d...never wake up...a..again,&quot; Mitsuki managed, 
between sobs. She broke away from Haruka long enough to dab off her tears 
onto a small handkerchief. Haruka felt her friend&#39;s muscles relax as she 
leant back into her gentle embrace. &quot;Don&#39;t do that to me again, 
Haruka-chan,&quot; she breathed into her ear. Haruka could only nod as her 
Mitsuki pulled away until their noses were barely inches apart. She could 
feel her heart beat a little faster as her friend&#39;s heated breath played 
across her cheek.

&quot;Wh...what are you doing, Mitsuki-chan?&quot; Mitsuki hushed her with a 
finger, her features gentle but serious. 

&quot;I think,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I need to tell you something. About how I 
feel. About you.&quot; Mitsuki&#39;s expression was strained, as if fighting 
against overflowing emotions. &quot;Haruka...I...&quot;

Suddenly, the sound of the sliding door opening shattered the moment. 
Mitsuki jumped off the bed like a startled cat as Akane&#39;s voice rang 
through the opened door.

&quot;Ta..da! It&#39;s Akane-chan again!&quot; Akane bounded through the doorway with 
her usual, seemingly limitless energy and gave a theatrical bow. Mitsuki 
applauded gently. &quot;Thank you...thank you,&quot; Akane&#39;s head rose from the bow 
and for the first time, she paused. &quot;Onee...chan?&quot; she whispered, eyes 
widening in surprise. Haruka gave a timid wave.

&quot;Ohayo, Akane chan.&quot; For the first time, Haruka was startled at how weak 
her voice seemed. This feeling was soon replaced by another desperate 
need to breathe as Akane squeezed the life out of the startled girl.

&quot;Ohayo...Onee-chan,&quot; came her muffled voice from a sea of red hair, &quot;I&#39;m 
so glad you&#39;re all right.&quot; Akane gave her sister a last squeeze and 
unwound their tangled limbs, swiping at a stray tear with the back of 
her free hand.

&quot;Akane,&quot; Mitsuki&#39;s voice broke the sudden silence, &quot;I&#39;ll...go and fetch 
the doctor, she&#39;ll probably want to know that Haruka&#39;s awake again.&quot; 

&quot;Hai, Mitsuki,&quot; Akane gave a brief nod as Mitsuki made a move for the 
door. Haruka couldn&#39;t help noticing as the two girls&#39; fingers touched 
for the briefest of moments as they passed. And maybe it was just her 
imagination, but she could swear that Akane had always referred to 
Mitsuki as &#39;Mitsuki-sempai&#39;. 

&#39;Just my imagination,&#39; she thought, as the door slid closed with a 
click. Turning back to her sister, who was righting the crumpled chair, 
she subjected her to a full inspection. Akane was wearing a slightly 
crumpled Hakuryou Academy uniform. Her bow was slightly lopsided, as if 
she had dressed in a hurry. That was all normal, Akane always rushed out 
after practise. The really suspicious thing, Haruka noticed, as her 
sister arranged herself in the newly righted chair, was that her hair, 
freed from her usual yellow headband hung down roughly, slightly 
covering her face. Haruka blinked a little in surprise. Her sister had 
always worn that headband, even to sleep sometimes; something was very 
strange indeed. Akane caught her sister&#39;s scathing gaze for a second and 
her face reddened, her usual genki manner silenced for a second.

&quot;Akane-chan,&quot; her voice came out sterner than she had expected. Her 
sister jerked up her gaze from her lap. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Haruka opted 
for the blunt approach.

&quot;O..onee-chan, that can wait till after the doctor comes to check 
whether you&#39;re all right!&quot; Akane laughed uncertainly and sweatdropped, 
forcing a grin.

&quot;Suzumiya Akane!&quot; Akane almost snapped to attention at this tone, but 
she took one look at Haruka&#39;s stern face and sagged back into her chair, 
defeated.

&quot;It&#39;s been really hard, you know, since the accident,&quot; she began. &quot;A lot 
has happened...&quot;

----------------------------

The door clicked open, as a silhouetted figure slipped through and 
slumped down against the other side of the door. Akane sighed. 
Everything was falling down around her ears, it seemed. Six months had 
passed since her sister&#39;s accident. The outer wounds had healed, but she 
just wouldn&#39;t wake up. Sensei had refused to give a decision on that 
front, instead stating that there had been cases where the patient had 
stayed asleep for days, months or even years. That didn&#39;t help. Akane 
had tried to rise above it, to not let it affect her; but in truth...

Akane sat; head slumped on her chest, resting against the door. Her mind 
floated back to earlier today. Her coach had been shouting at her, She 
wasn&#39;t trying hard enough anymore, she had said, not applying herself 
like she used to. She had listened to all the usual &#39;focus yourself, 
don&#39;t let yourself be distracted&#39; pep talk. Threats of dropping her from 
the team washed over her like a gentle rain. It wasn&#39;t that she didn&#39;t 
enjoy swimming, it just seemed that nothing really mattered that much 
any more. All the colours in Akane&#39;s world had faded into various shades 
of dull grey. It wasn&#39;t just swimming; her grades were slipping too. 
Akane brushed away a stray strand of hair and idly wondered what would 
happen if she dropped out from school. She was so deep in her own world 
that she almost didn&#39;t hear her mother calling her from downstairs

&quot;Akane-chan! Hayase-san is here to talk to you!&quot; her mother&#39;s voice rang 
out through the door.

&quot;Hai...&quot; Akane pulled herself off the floor and brushed herself off. She 
brightened a bit; it had been a while since she had seen Mitsuki-sempai. 
Except on a couple of occasions at the hospital, she had hardly seen her 
around. She had heard that Mitsuki had got snapped up by the FourX swim 
team as soon as she had graduated from Hakuryou, but what she did for 
the rest of her time; well she hadn&#39;t got around to asking. Her thoughts 
were interrupted by a soft knock at the door.

&quot;Akane-chan? Are you there?&quot; Akane relaxed as she heard her sempai&#39;s 
voice and turned the handle. 

&quot;Konban wa, Mitsuki sempai!&quot; Akane put on her best smile. She studied 
the figure standing in the doorway briefly. Mitsuki&#39;s hair still 
stretched down to just touch her waist. She was wearing a faded old pair 
of blue jeans and a plain white cotton shirt knotted above the navel. 
Akane&#39;s eyes rested there for the briefest of moments before making eye 
contact. &quot;Please come in,&quot; she heard herself say. 

&quot;So what brings you by, Mitsuki sempai? I don&#39;t usually see you around 
much anymore,&quot; Akane mumbled, the words tumbling out nervously as 
Mitsuki knelt down by her table.

Mitsuki smiled warmly and motioned to the position opposite. As Akane 
made herself comfortable, Mitsuki produced a cloth bag, which she opened 
to reveal a selection of slightly dented cookies. &quot;Gomen, Akane chan, 
they got a little crushed on the way here.&quot;

&quot;Oh no, Mitsuki sempai, if you made them, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re delicious.&quot; 
As if to demonstrate, she picked one of the morsels and popped it into 
her mouth. &quot;Oishii,&quot; Akane mumbled, through a mouthful of crumbs. 
Mitsuki laughed a little and Akane blushed, her troubles forgotten for a 
second. For a good few minutes, the pair sat in comfortable silence, 
chewing their way through the rest of the biscuits. As her hand snaked 
out to snatch the final cookie, Akane felt Mitsuki&#39;s hand gently clasp 
hers. 

&quot;Can&#39;t I have it?&quot; Akane gave Mitsuki the soulful eyes she usually 
reserved for persuading her parents to let her stay out late. 

&quot;Akane-chan,&quot; Akane looked up, sensing the sudden change in tone of her 
sempai&#39;s voice. &quot;I heard from Takayuki the other day that you&#39;re really 
letting your grades slip. He talked to your friends after school and 
they said that you&#39;d been skipping classes. This isn&#39;t like you Akane-
chan. What&#39;s going on? We&#39;re all worried about you...&quot;

Akane gazed into Mitsuki&#39;s blue eyes and saw compassion and worry. The 
hand reassuringly placed over her own clasped her gently. A tear rolled 
down her cheek, closely followed by a second and a third. Suddenly, 
Mitsuki was there hugging her close, whispering to her that it would be 
alright. Burying her face into the soft fabric of Mitsuki&#39;s clothes, she 
let the tears flow. 

---------------------------------

After that night, Mitsuki came round more frequently to the Suzumiya 
household, sometimes bringing treats, but more often than not, just a 
shoulder to cry on as Akane poured out her worries and Mitsuki stroked 
her hair, whispering soothing words. Slowly, almost imperceptibly at 
first, Akane began to improve. Skipping classes became a thing of the 
past and her grades were back on the rise. Her swimming, however, was 
another matter. Somehow, she managed to do enough to keep her coach from 
dropping her from the team, but her Olympic dream seemed further away 
than ever.

The sun shone brightly down on the high street. The clouds lazily 
strolled across the sky as if the wind had taken a day off. Mitsuki 
shaded her eyes from the glare and spotted Akane waving madly from the 
shade of an umbrella outside a caf&eacute;. Sitting down, Akane pushed a glass 
of iced tea over to her with a smile.

&quot;Sorry, I couldn&#39;t wait. This sun really makes you thirsty, huh?&quot; 
Mitsuki just smiled at her. She had just got back from an emotional 
reunion with her old coach at Hakuryo and there was something she needed 
to discuss with Akane.

&quot;Akane-chan, when were you going to tell me that coach has been on the 
verge of dropping you from the team for months?&quot; Mitsuki&#39;s face was 
serious. Akane looked down into her glass and uncomfortably fiddled with 
her straw.

&quot;I was going to tell you, sempai,&quot; Akane&#39;s fingers clasped the glass 
tensely, &quot;but I thought that you would think worse of me unless I did it 
by myself.&quot; Akane looked up at her sempai, whose expression had 
softened, &quot;Because I really respect you, sempai.&quot;

Akane felt a pang at her own words. Respect? How many nights had she 
cried herself to sleep on Mitsuki&#39;s shoulder, so that the older girl had 
to carry her to bed? She secretly always looked forward to this, hearing 
the slight grunt of effort as she was clasped in Mitsuki&#39;s gentle arms. 
Her heart beating a little faster as Mitsuki gave a good night kiss to 
the cheek of what she thought was a fast asleep Akane. She shook her 
head slightly to throw those thoughts to the back of her mind. 

&quot;Akane?&quot; Mitsuki was saying, &quot;Are you alright? You were spacing out 
there for a second.&quot; 

Akane could only nod mildly. &quot;I&#39;m alright, sempai. What were you 
saying?&quot;

&quot;I was saying that I could help you train for those upcoming trials. 
Winning those is just what you need to convince your coach not to ever 
think about dropping you!&quot; Mitsuki paused, &quot;That is, if you want to...&quot;

Akane was taken aback, &quot;Of course, I would be honoured to train with 
you; but I don&#39;t want you to go out of your way...I mean, you&#39;re probably 
really busy, with FourX and training and all that.&quot; she trailed off.

&quot;Don&#39;t be silly, Akane chan!&quot; Mitsuki grinned, &quot;How about Tuesday after 
school at the swimming pool? I&#39;ve made sure there aren&#39;t any class 
activities then and Coach was only too honoured to let me use the pool. 
As a sports idol, of course!&quot; Akane laughed and agreed.

Over two more iced teas and a round of cheesecake, the two girls got 
down to some of the less serious topics.

&quot;You&#39;re kidding!&quot; Akane giggled &quot;Takayuki&#39;s gay?&quot;

The other girl nodded and took a bite of the cheesecake, &quot;Yep, he&#39;s been 
&#39;seeing&#39; Shinji kun ever since the two of them both made it into 
Hakuryou University.&quot;

&quot;I always thought there was something extra between those guys! No 
wonder Haruka said it never felt right when she kissed him!&quot; Mitsuki&#39;s 
smile faltered slightly at the mention of Haruka&#39;s name, but Akane 
didn&#39;t notice. &quot;So is there someone you like, sempai?&quot;

Mitsuki felt the blood rush to her face, &quot;I guess there is someone...&quot; 
she answered hesitantly, &quot;but I can&#39;t tell them, or other people 
important to me will get hurt.&quot;

&quot;Sempai!&quot; Akane scolded, &quot;If you like this person, then you should tell 
them. I&#39;m sure the other people will understand. I mean, if you love 
someone, then you can&#39;t do anything about it. That&#39;s just love, you 
know.&quot; 

Mitsuki smiled wanly, &quot;Maybe I will...&quot;

------------------------------

 There was just something about watching Mitsuki swim that was 
mesmerising. Maybe it was the elegance; her lithe body cutting through 
the water, arms rising in perfect rhythm. But to Akane, all this paled 
into insignificance with the emergence of this mermaid from the water 
afterwards. She watched as Mitsuki shook her hair free and briefly 
wondered how she managed to keep her huge mass of hair inside her tiny 
swimming cap. Over the last few weeks of private training, she had got 
to watch Mitsuki swim many times, but this part, she decided, was 
definitely the best.

Since Akane was not one to avoid making important decisions when they 
had to be made, she had long decided that the feelings that she shared 
with her sempai were no longer those feelings of utmost respect felt 
between a kohai and sempai; but had blossomed into what she could only 
describe as love. Things changed, even indiscernibly to the naked eye. 
Hugs became longer and more intimate, goodbye kisses left her flushed 
and flustered. 

Akane openly gazed at Mitsuki&#39;s swimsuit-clad body. She had long given 
up on pretending that she didn&#39;t ogle her and now took every opportunity 
to make her sempai blush. &#39;She really is the most beautiful thing I have 
ever seen&#39; Akane thought, admiringly. Muscles rippled faintly underneath 
Mitsuki&#39;s Hakuryou school issue swimsuit and water dripped lazily from 
the slight outline of her breasts. Mitsuki blushed as Akane slowly drank 
in the sight. 

&quot;Let&#39;s go, Mitsuki-sempai,&quot; Akane slipped her arm through Mitsuki&#39;s, 
turning in the direction of the changing room. Mitsuki stiffened 
slightly at Akane&#39;s touch. 

&quot;Akane-chan...&quot;

&quot;Mitsuki-sempai? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Akane stared at the other girl, 
concerned.

&quot;Oh nothing!&quot; Mitsuki brushed it off, a little too cheerfully, &quot;I might 
have pulled something a bit on that last lap. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be 
okay.&quot; Mitsuki skilfully disengaged her arm from Akane and skipped off 
towards the changing room, leaving a confused Akane far behind.

&quot;Oh sempai?&quot; They were in the changing rooms now, Mitsuki in the shower 
as Akane pulled on her school uniform

&quot;Mm?&quot; came the reply from over the hiss of the shower.

&quot;My coach says she&#39;s putting me in for the trials for FourX next year. 
She says I&#39;ve really improved and that you&#39;ve had a great influence on 
me...&quot; Akane was cut short as a pair of wet arms waylaid her from behind.

&quot;That&#39;s fantastic Akane-chan!&quot; Mitsuki bear-hugged the surprised girl; 
&quot;See I told you that you could do anything if you really worked at it 
hard!&quot; She loosened her grip and Akane gaped, blood rushing to her face 
so fast she almost fainted.

&quot;M..m...Mitsuki-s...s..sempai,&quot; she managed. Mitsuki&#39;s eyes went wide and 
she quickly turned away from the gawping Akane.

&quot;Akane-chan ecchi!&quot; she tutted. &quot;If you stare too hard you might get a 
nosebleed!&quot;

Akane recovered enough to tear her eyes away from Mitsuki&#39;s exposed 
form. &quot;Gomen nasai sempai,&quot; she apologised, struggling to think 
straight. &quot;But I would be honoured if you would come over to my house 
for tea to celebrate tonight. I told my parents earlier today and my 
mother insisted on baking a cake.&quot; She risked a peek over her shoulder 
to see that Mitsuki had already dried off and was more or less decent. 
She sighed, half in relief, half in disappointment and tried to calm her 
racing hormones. &quot;We&#39;re not going to be able to eat it all, so it&#39;ll be 
a waste if you don&#39;t come...&quot;

Mitsuki smirked at the still-blushing girl. &quot;I&#39;ll come, just as long as 
you keep your eyes to yourself!&quot;

--------------------------------

Mitsuki stared around the impeccable neatness that was Akane&#39;s room. It 
seemed paradoxical that an impulsive and normally scruffy girl like 
Akane had such a feminine and tidy room. Shoujo manga neatly lined a 
bookshelf on one wall and a couple of Haruka&#39;s picture books lay opened 
on the desk. Mitsuki padded across the room to the bookcase and ran her 
finger over the spines of the books, searching for one she recognised. 
Suddenly, something caught her eye. A small passport sized picture frame 
rested on top of the bookcase, almost hidden behind two oversized teddy 
bears. 

Mitsuki squinted to bring it into better focus. It was a picture she 
recognised. Akane smiling her trademark grin, with her arm round the 
neck of a rather surprised blue haired girl. She smiled; she remembered 
Akane insisting on taking one with her when they had all gone to that 
fairground last year. She wondered for a while why Akane would keep such 
a thing in a frame. The obvious answer leapt up from her subconscious 
like an eager lemming, but she beat it back down again. It had to be a 
respect thing, she thought. There had been quite a few younger girls 
from the swim team who had confessed to her on various occasions and 
she&#39;d always put it down to Onee-sama complex. They&#39;d always been happy 
with a hug and a gentle refusal. Mitsuki steeled her resolve, &#39;She has 
to know that my heart belongs to someone else&#39; she thought to herself. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Akane-chan...&quot; she whispered.

&quot;Sorry for what?&quot; Akane stood behind her, cheerful as ever, tray of tea 
balanced on one hand and two magnificent slices of chocolate cake on the 
other. Meandering her way precariously to the low table, she arranged 
the crockery for the both of them.

&quot;Oh, nothing, Akane-chan,&quot; Mitsuki gathered her wits, &quot;I was just 
talking to myself. Wow that cake looks delicious!&quot;

Akane looked at her suspiciously for a moment, but her smile quickly 
returned, &quot;Help yourself, Mitsuki-sempai, there&#39;s plenty.&quot; As Mitsuki 
nibbled daintily at her slice of cake, Akane watched her intently. As 
Mitsuki caught her eye she hid behind her mug.

&quot;I told you to keep your eyes to yourself, didn&#39;t I?&quot; joked Mitsuki

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, sempai, but you&#39;re just so cute when you eat,&quot; suddenly, the 
temperature in the room seemed to rise a couple of degrees. Akane looked 
across the table, but Mitsuki seemed to be unaffected. &#39;Great,&#39; she 
thought. &#39;They could probably use my face to direct traffic. Can&#39;t let 
it throw me off. I&#39;m going to tell her today. I have to tell her today,&#39; 
she mentally cheered herself on.

Mitsuki studied the redness slowly rising to Akane&#39;s cheeks. She had 
seen this look on all of the girls before they confessed and she was 
well used to it. Somehow, though, this time seemed different. Maybe it 
was the slight flutter of her heartbeat or the strange feeling building 
in the pit of her stomach that caused her to lose all confidence in her 
once simple reply. Her mind yelled a message to her muscles to get out 
of there fast. &quot;Oh, Akane-chan!,&quot; she started, a little too loudly, &quot;I 
completely forgot! I promised the other guys in the team that we&#39;d all 
go out for a drink tonight.&quot; She stood up and quickly threw her rucksack 
over her shoulder, &quot;Gomen ne, Akane-chan, maybe we can do this some 
other time?&quot; Mitsuki made a break for the door.

She had one hand on the handle when Akane grabbed the other, &quot;Come on 
Akane-chan, I&#39;m going to be late,&quot; she managed, weakly, not turning 
round.

&quot;Don&#39;t go,&quot; Akane&#39;s soft voice almost echoed in the silent room, the two 
girls frozen in place, both too afraid to move and break the spell. 

&quot;Please don&#39;t go.&quot; Mitsuki felt her resolve leaking away with every 
syllable. She spun around to face her. And then Akane kissed her.

It wasn&#39;t a long kiss, perhaps only a few seconds, but to Mitsuki, it 
could have lasted for hours. As Akane slowly brushed her lips across her 
own, Mitsuki could feel the last drops of her willpower seep away. She 
pulled away, and they gazed into each other&#39;s eyes, unspeaking for a 
moment. A wave of loneliness, pent up for years washed away the 
whispered protests from her subconscious; suddenly her cold bed at home 
seemed infinitely less welcoming.

Akane spoke first, &quot;I...love you Mitsuki-sempai. I mean...I&#39;ve always 
respected you, I mean, you are my sempai,&quot; she stumbled over her words. 
&quot;I mean, you&#39;re so beautiful and kind...and funny; how could I not fall 
for you? I don&#39;t care that you love my sister. Please...just hold me 
tonight.&quot; Akane felt her face flush and she looked down at her feet.

Mitsuki was shocked for a second, &quot;How...how do you know?&quot; she stammered. 

&quot;You always talk about her so fondly, you come to the hospital four 
times a week, sometimes more, just to hold her hand. And it was pretty 
obvious when you two were out together that there was something else...all 
those lingering glances and sad eyes you used to give her,&quot; Akane 
twiddled her fingers nervously. &quot;And I might have sneaked a peek at your 
diary,&quot; she stared at her feet again. As she looked back at Mitsuki, she 
saw the stern scolding melt away on her sempai&#39;s lips.

&quot;So you know then,&quot; Mitsuki let out a long sigh, &quot;at least that saves me 
the trouble of telling you&quot; she slumped down on the bed. &quot;So why then?&quot; 
she asked, simply.

Akane sat beside her, &quot;I care deeply about my sister and my only wish is 
that she is happy. If it takes you to give her that, then I would be 
happy to back down. But now,&quot; Akane took Mitsuki&#39;s hand in hers, &quot;I need 
you to be with me. I love you Mitsuki-sempai. I mean, if you have no 
feelings for me, then I understand, but...I just had to say it,&quot; she 
finished lamely. She looked up from her lap. Mitsuki was smiling. She 
closed her eyes as the older girl closed the space between them and felt 
Mitsuki&#39;s soft lips envelop her own. And Akane kissed back with all her 
heart.

&quot;Thank you, Mitsuki-chan,&quot; she whispered, as their lips eventually 
parted. 

Mitsuki gently pushed Akane back onto the bed until their noses were 
almost touching. Tenderly, she stroked the other girls cheek.

&quot;I love you, Akane-chan.&quot;

--------------------------------

The light was fading to the dull glow of evening when Akane finally 
finished her story. The nurses Fumio and Amakawa had been in briefly to 
check up on Haruka, but she had quickly shooed them away. There had been 
no sign of Mitsuki at all.

&quot;Well, since that night,&quot; Akane continued, &quot;we&#39;ve been getting closer. 
Going out to the movies, out for dinner, you know, like a proper couple. 
Last Sunday I took her to that ice rink on the edge of town.&quot; Haruka 
nodded, she knew that Mitsuki had always wanted to go there, but had 
always been too busy with swimming. And besides, Shinji had been 
terrified of ice-skating for some reason, so the idea had been quickly 
abandoned. &quot;At first, whenever we went out, Mitsuki was always smiling, 
but I could see that twinge of sadness in her eyes.&quot; Akane brightened, 
&quot;But in the last few months before you first woke up I think she was 
getting happier. The smiles seemed more genuine I think. She even 
started asking me out on dates.&quot; Her eyes glazed over, lost in the 
memory for a moment, &quot;And the sex...well, not that it wasn&#39;t good before, 
but...&quot; she paused, catching sight of a furiously blushing older sister.

&quot;I...really didn&#39;t need to know that, Akane-chan,&quot; she grumbled, feeling 
her ears burn as wild steamy images ran unchecked across her 
imagination.

&quot;Onee-chan, it&#39;s so easy to make you blush!&quot; Akane giggled as she gave 
her sister a friendly hug.

Haruka slowly felt the redness subside, &quot;So what happened then? Did 
something happen when I woke up?&quot;

The joy quickly drained from her sister&#39;s features. &quot;Well, since you 
woke up for the first time, Onee-chan, Mitsuki&#39;s become...well, more 
distant, I suppose. We don&#39;t see each other as much as we used to. She 
doesn&#39;t come round every night like she did before and...and,&quot; she felt a 
lump building in her throat as the painful memories resurfaced in her 
mind. &quot;She didn&#39;t come to see me at the big swimming competition last 
week,&quot; she finished, tearfully.

Haruka embraced her sobbing sibling as strongly as her weakened muscles 
would allow and tried to comfort her as best she could.

&quot;She really loves you, Onee-chan,&quot; Akane mumbled through hospital issue 
cotton nightie, &quot;I think...maybe I was her replacement for you. I 
hope...I hope...she can make you happy,&quot; Akane burst into fresh floods 
of tears as Haruka hugged her tighter.

Eventually, as the flood slowed down to a trickle, Akane extracted 
herself from her sister&#39;s nightdress and wiped away the remnants with 
the sleeve of her school uniform. The two girls remained silent for a 
moment, the revelations proving a little too much to allow speech.

&quot;How do you feel about her?&quot; Akane whispered, breaking the silence.

Even though she was expecting this question, Haruka was still taken 
aback. How did she feel about Mitsuki? &quot;I think you were right...I suppose 
I have always thought of her as more than a friend, but to love her in 
that way?&quot; Suddenly, an image of Mitsuki crossed her mind, straddling 
her on the bed, as she had just a few hours previously, seconds away 
from confessing to her. She thought back to what she had been feeling at 
that moment. Surprise, shock perhaps, but love would have been the last 
thing she would have felt at that moment in time. &quot;I&#39;m not sure how I 
feel about her,&quot; she said, out loud. &quot;I need more time to work out how I 
feel...this is all so sudden,&quot; she rubbed her temples, vainly trying to 
curb an already angry headache.

Akane looked at her sadly. &quot;I think you&#39;ll have all the time in the 
world to make your mind up, Onee-chan.&quot; Haruka noticed her expression 
grow serious for a second, &quot;But, if you&#39;re going to break her heart, 
please, do it now. Seeing her killing herself over this makes me so 
sad.&quot; Akane rose to her feet, &quot;I have to go,&quot; she said, suddenly.

Tears streamed from her eyes as she turned to go, shining blood red in 
the evening light, &quot;I hope you find your happiness, Onee-chan,&quot; she 
whispered under her breath.

--------------------------

Outside the sliding door to the room, Mitsuki listened to the murmur of 
voices drift through the air. She wasn&#39;t listening too hard, half out of 
respect for Akane&#39;s wishes, and half because she already knew what was 
going to be said. Leaning back against the sterile-white wall, she gave 
a deep sigh and commanded her heart to calm down for the hundredth time.

Abruptly, Akane burst through the door, tears streaming from her eyes. 
Unspeaking, she hugged Mitsuki tightly, her free hand gently tilting the 
blue-haired girl&#39;s head to meet her quivering lips. Mitsuki felt Akane&#39;s 
feelings pouring themselves out into her, weeks of sadness and hurt 
compressed into a few brief seconds. When they finally separated, 
Akane&#39;s eyes looked lifeless and dull, their usual genki spark eerily 
absent. 

&quot;I&#39;ll always love you, Mitsuki-sempai.&quot; The words hung in the air as 
Akane turned and ran, not looking back. 

&quot;A..&quot; Mitsuki started, when she felt a tender hand on her shoulder. 
&quot;Sensei!&quot; she squealed, &quot;Don&#39;t surprise me like that!&quot; Kouzuki Motoko 
stood behind her, unfazed as always, chewing on the butt end of a long-
spent cigarette.

&quot;I think the thing that girl needs right now is some time to work things 
out in her head,&quot; she said, patting Mitsuki softly on the shoulder. &quot;You 
being around would only confuse her more. Right now there&#39;s someone else 
who needs you.&quot; Motoko slid open the door until it clacked back on its 
hinges. &quot;She wants to talk to you.&quot;

Mitsuki nodded sadly and stepped through the doorway.

-----------------------------

Mitsuki stepped through the doorway, the same doorway through which she 
had stepped almost every day for the last three years and stared. It was 
so different; Haruka&#39;s presence lifted the atmosphere making the room 
seem so vibrant...so alive. She felt her heart skip a beat as the night-
dressed figure on the bed gave a little wave. 

&quot;I...talked with Akane-chan.&quot; Haruka&#39;s voice jarred Mitsuki from her 
thoughts. She nodded, not having recovered the power of speech. &quot;It&#39;s 
true, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Haruka asked, simply. Mitsuki nodded again, slowly 
walking up to the bed and taking the other girl into her arms.

Stroking Haruka&#39;s long hair, Mitsuki could feel the hotness at the back 
of her eyes and knew she was going to cry. Welling up with the tears, 
words rushed desperately to her vocal chords; words left unsaid for 
three years. One by one they tumbled out, confessions of love rolled off 
her tongue so easily she wondered why she couldn&#39;t have done it before. 
She found herself telling Haruka that she had always loved her; from the 
minute she had met her on their first day at Hakuryou; how her heart 
beat a little faster every time she held her hand; how she had denied 
her own love as a bad influence and pushed her towards Takayuki. The 
confessions came thick and fast until she was out of breath and 
exhausted, sobbing into Haruka&#39;s gentle embrace.

&quot;I was really jealous of Takayuki for a while, you know,&quot; whispered 
Mitsuki, after she had calmed down; &quot;I tried to do little things, so 
maybe you wouldn&#39;t like him as much as you did. Talking to him to make 
him late for your dates, mentioning his bad habits to you, things like 
that.&quot; She paused, &quot;It was a little immature, now that I look back on 
it.&quot; An ironic smile forced its way across her face, &quot;I felt so guilty 
after the accident. I thought that maybe if I hadn&#39;t been so immature, 
he wouldn&#39;t have been late for your date, then you wouldn&#39;t have...
have...&quot; 

Haruka stroked her friend&#39;s shoulder as the floodgates opened again. &quot;It 
wasn&#39;t your fault,&quot; she whispered soothingly, &quot;You couldn&#39;t have 
realised, no one could have.&quot; Mitsuki looked up at her friend, her face 
brightening into a sad smile.

&quot;I always loved that about you,&quot; she murmured. &quot;You never blamed anyone, 
never held any grudges. Always so kind...&quot; 

Haruka blushed and for a moment the only sound was the rustling of the 
leaves on the old oak outside. &quot;So what happened between you and Akane-
chan, then?&quot; she asked, finally.

Mitsuki sighed and reeled her mind back to that time, &quot;When you had your 
accident, I fell into a depression; the only thing keeping me going was 
my swimming, so I threw myself desperately into that. As soon as I left 
Hakuryou academy, the FourX swim team snapped me up, and I took up 
swimming mostly full time. Doing something I loved did help to keep my 
mind off you.&quot; She paused, taking a sip from the water glass on the 
table by Haruka&#39;s bed. &quot;That&#39;s when I learned about Akane&#39;s school 
problems; one of my team still had friends at Hakuryou Academy. It was 
that night I went round to comfort her and...well, I think Akane told you 
the rest.&quot;

She paused, thinking for a moment, &quot;I think maybe, deep down, I said 
&#39;yes&#39; to Akane-chan because she reminded me of you...shy, a little unsure 
of herself and emotional, but covered in her brash stubborn exterior.&quot; 
Mitsuki smiled, &quot;We always agreed that things would change if you woke 
up. When I saw you awake for the first time in three years, my heart 
almost jumped for joy. All those old feelings came flooding back...I 
couldn&#39;t even look you in the eye the first time we came to visit.&quot; 
Haruka smiled as she remembered the oversized bunch of tulips.

&quot;I don&#39;t know how you feel about me. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll ever love me 
in that way, but I love you. I always have. All I&#39;m asking for is for 
you to give us a chance. Please...&quot; Mitsuki gripped Haruka&#39;s hand tightly, 
her eyes begging for that chance to make her happy. 

Haruka took one look into those blue soulful eyes and any resistance or 
scruples in the depths of her mind dissolved away into nothingness. She 
blushed, &quot;Mitsuki-chan,&quot; she croaked, &quot;you&#39;re not giving me much of a 
chance to make up my mind! I&#39;ve only just woken up again, I need more 
time.&quot; Haruka waved her arms around, flustered beyond all measure, &quot;Of 
course I&#39;ve always thought of you as more than a friend, but this is all 
so sudden.&quot; 

&quot;I need more time,&quot; she repeated, more steadily this time. Mitsuki 
leaned forward and gathered up the other girl in a final embrace. After 
the initial surprise, Haruka found herself hugging back in return.

&quot;You have all the time you want,&quot; replied Mitsuki, &quot;After all, if I hurt 
you, Akane-chan would kill me...&quot; 

Haruka laughed at that.

----------------------------

Since that day, Mitsuki came to visit the bedridden Haruka every day 
after practices as the other girl struggled to regain her lost strength. 
Haruka always protested that Mitsuki needed to put more effort into her 
swimming, and that she wouldn&#39;t suddenly waste away if her friend didn&#39;t 
come to visit every single day, but Mitsuki wasn&#39;t having any of it. 
They sat and talked for hours: about how their old school friends were 
doing, when Mitsuki was going to be in the Olympics and reminiscing 
about their times in Hakuryou academy. Mitsuki made fun of Haruka&#39;s 
crushes on male teachers, but her eyes went wide as saucers as Haruka 
admitted several crushes on female sempais whose shoe lockers Mitsuki 
had also once placed heartfelt letters of love into. If you&#39;d asked 
Haruka, she would have said that it was just like old times.

Akane also came to visit regularly, but she always scheduled her 
visiting times to avoid her ex-love. The times they did accidentally 
bump into each other were quickly cut short by brief nods and curt 
farewells. Akane herself talked to her sister as if nothing had ever 
happened between herself and her former girlfriend and was always quick 
to steer conversations clear of the topic. If Mitsuki&#39;s name was 
mentioned, just accidentally in conversation, Haruka would notice a 
brief sadness cross Akane&#39;s mask of happiness, though it was quickly 
wiped away by a &quot;Ne, Onee-chan don&#39;t worry about me!&quot; accompanied by an 
uneasy laugh. When pushed further, Akane would only state again and 
again that it was more than enough to see her sister happy. Eventually, 
even Haruka started to avoid the subject as well, both for her sister&#39;s 
sake and for the increasing levels of guilt building over the tension 
between the two most important people in her life.

A few weeks later, in the rehabilitation clinic, Mitsuki showed up 
unexpectedly. Haruka had quickly determined the times for Mitsuki&#39;s 
practices and other commitments and had thought that she had planned her 
rehab sessions around them. So surprised was she to see Mitsuki at the 
end of the runway that she almost lost her grip on the rails, slipping 
but managing to catch herself on her elbows. She felt strong hands 
taking the weight off her tired arms and helping her back into her 
wheelchair.

&quot;Mitsuki-chan!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;I thought you had practice today? What 
are you doing here...its...embarrassing for you to see me like this.&quot;

Mitsuki grinned, &quot;Practice was cancelled today, coach said she had some 
other commitments she couldn&#39;t cancel.&quot; She stretched her arms above her 
head. &quot;I thought I&#39;d drop in and see how the rehab was going.&quot; Haruka 
nodded, still a little embarrassed. &quot;Do you want to go down to the 
beach?&quot; 

-------------------------

Before she knew it, Haruka was being pushed leisurely down the path 
towards the beachfront in her wheelchair. She basked in the rays of the 
evening sun, feeling the heat slowly warming her pale skin. She looked 
up at her friend, but her eyes were fixed ahead. Briefly, Haruka admired 
the way the sun silhouetted Mitsuki&#39;s features so perfectly. Her eyes 
sparkled gently and her skin glowed warmly in the dwindling light. Her 
hair flowed slightly in the breeze, accentuating Mitsuki&#39;s natural 
grace. For a moment, Haruka felt she could fall in love with her there 
and then.

Suddenly, they were at the beach. Unusually, no one had been there 
today, and the sands stretched out before Haruka&#39;s eyes, flat and 
featureless, save for the faint tracks of a few sand-dwellers and birds 
here and there. They stayed in comfortable silence for a few minutes, 
each happy just with the other&#39;s company as the sun set lazily in the 
distance. 

Mitsuki smiled down at her friend, &quot;Beautiful, isn&#39;t it?&quot; She looked 
back up at the crimson sky and sighed contentedly, &quot;I&#39;m glad we can 
share times like these again. It kinda reminds me of the times we used 
to sit with Takayuki-kun and Shinji-kun on his hill, just watching the 
sunsets over the town.&quot;

Haruka nodded. &quot;I&#39;ve really enjoyed these past few weeks with you,&quot; she 
replied, suddenly emboldened. &quot;I&#39;ve...asked Sensei&#39;s permission. Would 
you like to come on a...date with me...maybe to get something to eat? 
Sensei says its okay as long as its somewhere close...&quot;

Mitsuki hesitated, just for a split second, &quot;A d...d..date?&quot; she 
stuttered, &quot;are you sure you&#39;re okay with that? I don&#39;t want to be 
pushing you too fast!&quot; 

Haruka giggled at her flustered companion. &quot;What&#39;s wrong? I&#39;m sure 
you&#39;ve been itching to ask me out since you confessed.&quot;

Mitsuki narrowed her eyes slightly, &quot;That&#39;s awfully forward of you. When 
we were in high school you would be blushing from head to toe even 
thinking about asking someone out.&quot;

&quot;Well, I guess...I grew up a little,&quot; Haruka relaxed back into her chair, 
&quot;I can&#39;t stay the way I was forever you know, Mitsuki-chan. I&#39;ve got 
three years of growing to catch up on, and it occurs to me that 
obsessing so much over something like that is just so...&quot; she paused for 
a second, collecting her thoughts. &quot;I just want to make up for the time 
I lost,&quot; she explained.

Mitsuki nodded in agreement and the two of them were silent for a 
moment, listening to the waves breaking gently onto the beach and the 
squawking of the seabirds in the distance.

&quot;By the way...I don&#39;t suppose you could tell me how Akane-chan is doing?&quot; 
Mitsuki asked after a few minutes. &quot;Only, she hasn&#39;t been returning my 
calls lately.&quot; Haruka looked questioningly up at her friend, &quot;I only 
want to know if she&#39;s okay or not,&quot; Mitsuki blurted, &quot;I mean, just 
because we aren&#39;t together now doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t care about her...&quot;

Haruka&#39;s face broke into a smile, &quot;She&#39;s okay. I think she&#39;s coping. She 
keeps saying to me that as long as I&#39;m happy then she is as well. But I 
think that my waking up really hit her hard. She&#39;ll need some time to 
adjust, perhaps.&quot;

A frown passed briefly across Mitsuki&#39;s features, &quot;And are you happy?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; came the reply, &quot;I really appreciate the time we&#39;ve spent 
together as &#39;just friends&#39;. But I think we need more time before we 
start thinking about turning it into something more serious, Mitsuki-
chan.&quot; Her voice accompanied a warm smile.

&quot;But...what about tomorrow? Isn&#39;t that...a date?&quot;.

&quot;Trust me,&quot; she replied, simply.

------------------------

Later that night, Mitsuki sat in her room, her back against the bed, the 
lights turned out. In her arms she clutched a large cushion to her 
chest, her eyes focussing on nothing in particular. She had been sitting 
that way for about two hours now, and the pins and needles were starting 
to work their way up her legs. Silently, she crushed the pillow against 
herself tighter.

Suddenly, the phone burst into life. Mitsuki lunged across the room, but 
her numbed legs protested, collapsing beneath her. She just managed to 
grab the phone off the hook before tumbling to the floor in a heap.

&quot;Akane-chan?&quot; she said into the receiver, desperately.

The voice at the end of the line was distinctly male. &quot;Mitsuki-chan?&quot;

&quot;Oh! Takayuki-kun!&quot; Mitsuki tried not to sound disappointed, &quot;What&#39;s 
up?&quot;

&quot;I went to visit Haruka-chan today, she said that you two are looking 
for somewhere to eat tomorrow night. I suggested that you came to the 
restaurant I work in, you know, Sky Temple? It&#39;s just down the road from 
the hospital. I could ask the chef to whip you up something special. 
Anyway, I haven&#39;t seen you for ages, it would be good to catch up.&quot;

&quot;Hai,&quot; Mitsuki felt a little bewildered.

&quot;Anyway, I need to get back to work now...See you tomorrow night!&quot; The 
phone clicked back into a dial tone. Mitsuki stared at it for a moment, 
as if it was the root of all her problems, before giving up and 
collapsing face first into the bed.

-----------------------

The next evening, Mitsuki wheeled Haruka down the road towards the 
restaurant, her wheels bumping gently across the car park. Haruka 
watched her friend closely. For the entire fifteen-minute walk, Mitsuki 
had been strangely silent, slightly spaced out, her gaze fixed intently 
on the road in front of her. Her trance ended suddenly as she felt 
slender fingers tenderly intertwine with her own. Surprised, she looked 
down at Haruka.

&quot;We&#39;re here, Mitsuki-chan&quot;

&quot;Gomen nasai, Haruka-chan, I was miles away,&quot; Haruka squeezed Mitsuki&#39;s 
fingers soothingly.

&quot;Ah, there you are!&quot; A third voice caused both girls to whip round, 
&quot;Mayu-chan said you&#39;ve been standing outside here for ages. Now come in 
quickly, I don&#39;t want Haruka to catch a cold!&quot; Takayuki stood sternly 
between the sliding doors, hands on hips.

The tension dissolved in a flurry of hugs and gentle jibes as the two 
girls greeted their old friend. &quot;So you&#39;re not worried about me getting 
a cold then, Takayuki-kun?&quot; Mitsuki mock-pouted as they wheeled Haruka 
to their table.

&quot;Well, Haruka-chan is meek and feminine! She needs to be protec..&quot; 
Takayuki ducked under a glancing blow from Mitsuki&#39;s right fist. &quot;I&#39;ll 
just get Mayu-chan to get the menus,&quot; he added hastily, feeling their 
scathing glares burning into his back as he ran into the kitchen.

&quot;Takayuki-kun hasn&#39;t changed much, ne, Mitsuki-chan?&quot; Haruka turned to 
look at her friend, but her eyes were elsewhere again, and she seemed to 
be staring thoughtfully at a rubber pot plant. &quot;Mitsuki-chan?&quot; she 
repeated.

&quot;Gomen,&quot; Mitsuki apologised again, &quot;It&#39;s just...Akane hasn&#39;t contacted me 
at all for nearly two weeks now...&quot;

Her explanation was interrrupted by the arrival of a cute mousey-brown 
haired girl with a cat hairclip wearing a frilly maid uniform that 
seemed to provide more than just the usual restaurant service for the 
customers. &quot;Irrashaimasen!&quot; she beamed at them, seemingly oblivious of 
the fact. &quot;I&#39;m Tamano Mayu, and I&#39;ll be your waitress this evening! Is 
there anything from the menu that you would like to order?&quot; 

Haruka giggled, &quot;That&#39;s a lovely uniform, Mayu-chan! But Takayuki told 
us that he&#39;d tell the chef to cook us something special...&quot;

&quot;He did? Eto...&quot; Mayu looked confused for a second. &quot;Sumimasen!&quot; She 
bowed deeply and sauntered off in the direction of the kitchen shouting 
&quot;Sempai!!! What do I do now?&quot; before being clouted about the ear by a 
young girl with blonde ponytails.

Quickly, the food arrived, steaming and delicious on two huge platters, 
accompanied by a seemingly endless bowl of rice. Their problems put 
aside for a second, both girls realised just how hungry emotional 
discussions can make a person and found themselves ravenously attacking 
the mouth-watering meal. Soon afterwards, as Mayu arrived again briefly 
to remove their empty plates, they were stuffed to bursting. Mitsuki lay 
back in her seat and groaned, holding her stomach.

&quot;I think I overdid it...&quot; she moaned. Haruka wiped her mouth daintily 
with a handkerchief. &quot;I&#39;m curious, Haruka-chan,&quot; Mitsuki asked, suddenly, 
&quot;Why did you want to go out on a date with me, but tell me that we 
should think about it before making the next step? It&#39;s been puzzling me 
ever since yesterday and I just can&#39;t work it out.&quot;

&quot;I thought we should go here tonight because I want to tell you 
something.&quot; Haruka took a deep breath and sighed, mentally preparing 
herself, &quot;Mitsuki-chan, you have been more than a friend to me and you 
will always be my best friend, regardless.&quot; Mitsuki felt her heart drop 
sickeningly in her chest, guessing where this confession was going. 

&quot;But I can&#39;t love you.&quot;

Mitsuki felt like her heart had been shattered into a million pieces. 
For a moment she was too stunned to speak. &quot;Do you love...someone else?&quot; 
she managed to say, gritting her teeth to hold back the tears.

&quot;No,&quot; came the reply. &quot;You do.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Mitsuki couldn&#39;t help but be taken aback. She was 
flabbergasted, shocked, stunned, bewildered; all of the above and more. 
Surely Haruka was the only one she loved? 

&quot;Akane,&quot; came the reply, a little sadly. &quot;Don&#39;t you miss her? You&#39;ve 
been asking about her a lot...you get distant when I mention her and 
Takayuki told me how you answered his call last night.&quot; Mitsuki hung her 
head. &quot;She loved you, Mitsuki-chan. She says she&#39;s okay, but I can see 
through the mask she always wears. She misses you immensely. She needs 
you. Deep down, you know you still love her dearly.&quot; 

Suddenly, all of the haze of confusion in Mitsuki&#39;s mind cleared, just 
long enough for one shining truth to force its way out into the open. 
She broke down in tears. &quot;I do! God I do love her so much...&quot; she sobbed. 
&quot;But how do you know she would take me back after all the pain I caused 
her?&quot;

Haruka gripped her friend&#39;s hands gently. &quot;I don&#39;t know if she will, but 
love is all about taking those risks, isn&#39;t it? Isn&#39;t Akane-chan worth 
putting your heart on the line for?&quot; 

Mitsuki hugged Haruka tightly across the table, sobbing quietly. &quot;Thank 
you...thank you Haruka-chan, for showing me what an idiot I&#39;ve been.&quot;

Haruka held her friend in her arms, tenderly stroking her hair with her 
free hand. &quot;Now you&#39;d better go, Akane-chan is going to be back from 
practice in exactly one hour. You&#39;d better hurry if you&#39;re going to make 
it on time.&quot;

Mitsuki extricated herself from Haruka&#39;s grip and nodded again. &quot;Thank 
you,&quot; she repeated. &quot;But what about you?&quot;

&quot;Takayuki already offered to take me back to the hospital after he 
finishes his shift here in an hour.&quot;

Mitsuki shook her head, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean that.&quot;

Haruka smiled, &quot;Seeing my two favourite people happy makes me happier 
than you could ever imagine. Don&#39;t worry, Mitsuki-chan, I&#39;ll find my 
special someone someday. Now go!&quot; she motioned towards the door.

In a flash of blue, Mitsuki jumped out of her seat and enveloped the 
other girl in her arms. Haruka felt Mitsuki&#39;s lips press urgently 
against her own; her tongue delicately tracing patterns that made her 
skin prickle and her face flush bright crimson. And then just as 
quickly, it ended, leaving a blushing and startled Haruka and a quickly 
receding Mitsuki as she raced out through the front doors, waving.

&quot;Good luck, Mitsuki-chan,&quot; she whispered under her breath.

&quot;Oh, I see your friend left,&quot; Haruka noticed the waitress from before 
standing beside her table. Mayu smiled warmly at her. &quot;Can I get you any 
dessert?&quot;

Despite herself, Haruka found herself returning the grin, admiring this 
girl&#39;s unbreakable genki spirit. &quot;Oh,&quot; she said, &quot;I hadn&#39;t thought about 
that yet...what would you recommend?&quot;

-----------------------

The key slowly turned in the lock and the door creaked tiredly open, 
revealing an exhausted Suzumiya Akane. Kicking her shoes off, she sloped 
towards the shower, desperate to wash off the sweat from her weights 
training, part of her coach&#39;s new scheme to build up their upper body 
strength. She sighed, at least it kept her mind off moping about her ex-
love. Slipping out of her sweaty clothes, she dumped her kit 
unceremoniously into the washing machine. As she slipped her yellow 
headband over her head, she caught sight of herself in the mirror, hair 
down and dishevelled. She sighed, tossing the headband the same way and 
headed towards the shower.

As the hot beads of water massaged her aching muscles, Akane relaxed and 
tried not to think about all the troubles in her life. So engrossed was 
she in relaxing, that she didn&#39;t notice the shower door close for a 
second time until a pair of arms embraced her from behind. &quot;I always 
told you your hair looked so much better down,&quot; a soft voice murmured 
behind her.

&quot;Mitsuki-sempai? What are you doing here?&quot; she yelped in surprise, 
turning to face her former lover. 

&quot;I came to say I was sorry,&quot; said Mitsuki, still holding Akane gently in 
her arms. &quot;I&#39;ve been such an idiot these past few months. I can&#39;t 
believe I hurt you for so long without realising my true feelings. I 
love you Akane-chan, and I want to make it up to you...for as long as it 
takes for you to forgive me for what I&#39;ve done.&quot;

&quot;I fell in love with your sister a long time ago, but it was stupid to 
think that my feelings for her would be the same as they were back then 
three years ago. Things changed. I changed, because of you. When we 
started going out, I think the only thing I saw was your sister in you, 
her mannerisms, all your similarities; but as I got to know you better, 
I started to fall in love with you. I fell for all the things that made 
you unique: your perpetual cheerfulness, the way you always were so 
stubborn not to ask for help from anyone,&quot; Mitsuki ran her fingers 
lightly down the other girl&#39;s sides. &quot;Not to mention everything you 
taught me.&quot;

&quot;What about Onee-chan?&quot; she asked, quietly. &quot;Do you still love her?&quot;

&quot;I still love Haruka as a friend. We can live without each other, but I 
can&#39;t live without you, Akane-chan. When you ran away from me that day, 
all I could think about was you: all the times we spent together, all 
the nights we spent, just in each other&#39;s arms. When you stopped calling 
me, I thought of you every day, wondering how you were, why you didn&#39;t 
want to talk to me any more. Please, Akane-chan, I was such a fool to 
let you go, give me another chance and I will do it right. I will make 
you happy. I swear I will.&quot;

Through the steam of the shower, Akane saw the determination in 
Mitsuki&#39;s eyes; determination to put right what she had done wrong. And 
just like that, Akane felt her fears melt away. She looked up at her 
lover to be and tenderly claimed her lips with her own.

&quot;Damn it! Where&#39;s that lazy girl got to?&quot; Daikuji Ayu flicked a wave of 
blonde hair back over her shoulder and fumed. The lovebirds were at it 
on table two again; it always made her mad that they wouldn&#39;t listen 
when she asked for their order and ordering Mayu around always made her 
feel better. 

She was just stomping past the storeroom when she heard rustling noises 
and the banging of boxes. Ayu smiled to herself, maybe Mayu had gotten 
lost in the stacks again. Last time it had taken her an hour and a half 
to find her way out with 12 cartons of orange juice, only to find that 
the chef had asked for croutons. She smiled evilly, &quot;I suppose I could 
help out that lazy bug this time,&quot; she said, out loud.

As she opened the door to the storeroom, the first thing she noticed was 
Mayu, in full view of the door, facing away from her sitting on a crate 
of mixed nuts. She called out to her, &quot;Oi, Mayumayu, there&#39;s work to be 
done; what are you doing lazing around in here?&quot; she started to walk 
towards her.

Mayu spun her head round towards her, her eyes widening in surprise. 
&quot;H...h.h.ai, S....se..sempai, I&#39;m c...c..coming,&quot; she stammered. Ayu took 
one more step and Mayu let out a little yelp.

&quot;Mayumayu, are you okay?&quot; Ayu seemed genuinely concerned, &quot;Did you hurt 
yourself walking around here in the dark?&quot;

&quot;No...I&#39;m okay, I&#39;m just...a...little busy...right now,&quot; Mayu seemed out 
of breath and breathing heavily.

There was another click and the door opened again. Takayuki poked his 
head around the gap. &quot;Hey, Daikuji, there you are. The floor is packed, 
we&#39;ve got customers out of our ears, get out there now!&quot; He looked 
closer at the two girls and smiled, &quot;Daikuji, didn&#39;t anyone tell you 
that it&#39;s rude to peep in on other people&#39;s private time?&quot;

Ayu was puzzled for a second. But then she noticed how Mayu&#39;s uniform 
seemed to be undone a little further down the front and seemed to be 
making its way down one arm; how her hair was more dishevelled than 
usual; how her expression had guilt written all over it. Her eyes 
widened in disbelief.

&quot;Sempai...I...&quot; was all Mayu managed before letting out another yelp.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter Daikuji? You jealous?&quot; Takayuki quipped, before 
ducking back to avoid a tin of canned salmon. Ayu ran out of the door 
after the retreating figure, letting the door slam shut behind her. 

&quot;LAZY BUGS! YOU CAN ALL GO STEP IN CAT SHIT!&quot; Mayu winced as Ayu&#39;s voice 
came loud and clear through the door. She made a face at the girl 
grinning up at her from her lap

&quot;Haruka-chan hidoi desu,&quot; she whined, but her complaints quickly 
silenced as Haruka resumed her ministrations. &quot;Kimochi...&quot; she breathed, 
her skin tingling with every stroke of Haruka&#39;s skilful tongue.

&quot;I can&#39;t help it. You&#39;re so cute when you&#39;re flustered,&quot; came the 
muffled voice from down below. Mayu didn&#39;t reply but pushed her lover&#39;s 
head further between her thighs.
