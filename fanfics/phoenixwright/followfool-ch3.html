<h1>Follow the Fool (part 3 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../phoenixwright/index.html">Phoenix Wright</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cantfake.html">CantFaketheFunk</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../phoenixwright/followfool-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Light. It was light outside... surprisingly and irritatingly bright. 
Franziska von Karma&#39;s eyes slowly slid open&#151;and then closed tightly 
against the painful glare that she knew logically was merely the gentle 
mid-morning sunlight filtering through her curtains but felt so much 
harsher and...

Her eyes opened wide suddenly. Mid-morning?! Franziska practically 
jumped out of her bed, her still half-asleep brain scrambling to wake up 
and match her pace (dimly recognizing that she was in her normal, 
everyday outfit and had likely fallen asleep in such). She was never 
late to work. Ever since she had passed the bar at the ludicrously young 
age of 13, the only times she had ever been late or missed work entirely 
had been when she&#39;d been shot in the shoulder, and... well, that was 
that. To oversleep like this, no matter how tired she&#39;d been, was 
absolutely unacceptable.

It wasn&#39;t until she was frantically slipping her stocking-clad feet into 
her boots that her mind finally caught up with her, and with an 
embarrassed pause she remembered that it was, in fact, Saturday. Though 
she normally would work all weekend if she&#39;d taken a case, the young 
prosecutor had no tasks on her plate&#151;for the moment, anyway. Franziska 
still mentally harangued herself for sleeping so late; even if she had 
had no responsibilities, it was still inexcusable to be so... sloppy.

This is wrong. This is... I can&#39;t... what&#39;s wrong with me? Franziska sat 
on the edge of her comfortable queen-sized bed, eyes closed in 
concentration. Sloppy. She was being sloppy and careless, and this was 
not like her&#151;it should not be like her. If her father were watching 
her... she could almost hear his voice, deep and so maddeningly calm 
that she would almost beg to be disciplined&#151;but knew that if she broke 
down and gave in to his psychological warfare that it would only be 
worse for her. His gaze, disapproving no matter what she did, almost 
daring her to succeed&#151;which she pushed herself to the point of 
exhaustion to do.

Her father had been a genius, of that there was no question. He had 
consigned his younger daughter and his practically-adopted son to the 
flames in hoping of forging a worthy successor... but Manfred von 
Karma&#39;s true brilliance could not be taught. One could not learn his 
clever insights, the way he masterfully crafted every single phrase he 
uttered to intimidate and coerce, or his diabolical charisma. Her father 
had been perfect, but the von Karma line might as well have ended with 
him.

Miles had not been worthy of the von Karma name. Neither am I. And... 
yet, she didn&#39;t know how she felt about that. In a strange coincidence, 
all three of them had had their perfect win records dashed to the ground 
and scattered into the winds by the same defense attorney. Her father... 
well, that case had been his end. Franziska suspected, though, that even 
if her father&#39;s crime had not been proven, the loss of his perfection 
might as well have killed him.

Manfred von Karma was gone, and in his place were two prot&eacute;g&eacute;s that 
could never be as good as the original&#151;two failed successors. When she&#39;d 
heard about the &#39;death&#39; of Miles Edgeworth, Franziska had known that he 
still lived, a gut feeling that turned out to be correct. His flight had 
been nigh-incomprehensible to her, and surely a sign of weakness. So, 
the final perfect von Karma had come to America... there had probably 
been a part of Franziska that longed to best Phoenix Wright in the 
courtroom, not out of some twisted desire to avenge her father, but to 
prove to herself and the world that she was good enough. That she could 
do something even her mighty father could not. That an exhausted little 
girl no longer had to be terrified of the eternal specter of Manfred von 
Karma.

But she had come to America mostly because of Miles. He was lost, he was 
weak... she wanted to believe he needed her. She was still perfect, and 
came to find Miles, so that she could guide her little brother back onto 
the path he&#39;d fallen from like a good big sister should.

Nevertheless, her plans had backfired. She was unable to best Wright in 
court&#151;her father&#39;s shadow weighed heavily upon her, her perfect record 
was lost... and worst of all, Franziska had found that Miles had found 
his own path. Not only did he not need her help, he didn&#39;t want it. 
Amidst the shame of losing her perfect record and knowing that she was 
to forever remain inferior to even her father&#39;s memory... that wound cut 
the deepest of all. Franziska had known that her father had never needed 
her help, but she&#39;d always told herself that her little brother would 
always have need for her as an older sister. With that last comfort 
severed in an instant, Franziska was alone.

If there was a single person in the world whom Franziska von Karma 
trusted, it was her little brother. He had said that he&#39;d needed to find 
for himself what being a prosecutor truly meant... at the time, it had 
sounded like nonsense to the young prosecutor. You were supposed to win. 
Stop at nothing to get that guilty verdict... that was the von Karma 
way. It was what the two of them had been taught since, well, she had 
learned to read.

And then she had lost. Not because of trickery or underhanded methods or 
an obfuscation of the truth... but because the defendants had truly been 
innocent. Something had then triggered in the young von Karma, something 
that she tried her hardest to suppress but found herself quite unable to 
despite herself. Those defendants had been innocent. She had been trying 
her hardest to see them found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.

How many others were innocent...?

It was a thought that made her shudder, though she would never let 
anybody see. Did she have innocent blood on her hands? Her father had 
truly been a murderer, but was she any better just because her own 
method of killing involved the government and a legal brief instead of a 
pistol or a knife?

Miles had unknowingly used forged evidence to convict a man of murder. 
Was that why he had fled? To find out what being a prosecutor truly 
meant so that he would never have to worry about innocent blood on his 
hands?

Franziska knew that Miles had been right. Her father, as genius as he 
was... she didn&#39;t know if she wanted to be like him, even if it was 
possible. In some way, that felt like betraying the von Karma name even 
more than her failures in court ever could have.

So, on her return to Germany, she had resolved to work at her tasks 
harder than ever before, making sure that the person on the defendant&#39;s 
stand was the right person. Not for her father, but for her brother. 
Because he had been right... but he also had Wright. Somebody whom he 
could trust to counter his every move, and whom he could afford to go 
full force against, because he knew that Phoenix Wright would be giving 
it his all as well... to uncover the truth.

The prosecutor, barely more than a girl, had nobody whom she could trust 
like that, nobody that she could rely on. So Franziska resolved to do 
double the work, since she could only really rely on herself...

I&#39;m such a fool.

Sighing to herself, Franziska climbed to her feet and walked to her 
bedroom door, pulling it open&#151;and stopping short, momentarily startled 
at the sight of a blonde-haired woman in a simple black T-shirt and 
jeans curled up on her couch, reading a book. Adrian... she&#39;d completely 
forgotten that the other woman was staying here.

In a flash, the prior night came crashing back to her, her humiliating 
breakdown borne of exhaustion and frustration, Adrian&#39;s attempt at 
comforting her, and her angry reaction to something that the American 
had said... her cheeks flushed in a brief flash of embarrassment. Now, 
with a rested, lucid mind, she knew that her actions had been completely 
inexcusable, lashing out at a vulnerable woman who had admitted in that 
same conversation that she had trusted&#151;and still trusted&#151;the German 
girl. Just one more thing she had to make amends for...

Adrian looked up from her book and smiled, pushing her glasses back up 
from where they&#39;d slid down during her reading, &quot;Good morning,&quot; she said 
in a bright tone of voice, as if nothing had happened at all the 
previous night. It made Franziska feel slightly more uncomfortable, to 
be honest. &quot;Do you feel a bit more rested, now? I... I made you 
breakfast,&quot; she said with a sheepish smile, pointing to what looked to 
be an attempt at an omelet in a cast-iron skillet on the stove.

Though she hated to admit it, Franziska was starving... she realized 
that she hadn&#39;t had anything since dinner the previous night, consumed 
as she was with yesterday&#39;s trial. So, thanking Adrian quietly, 
Franziska looked at the yellow concoction on her plate with what might 
have been utter dismay. She didn&#39;t think omelets were supposed to be 
so... runny.

A bite confirmed that it didn&#39;t taste any better than it looked, and it 
was only her pride and dignity that kept her from making a face and 
spitting out. She forced herself to swallow, then faked a smile, &quot;It&#39;s 
very good. Thank you for making it for me.&quot;

The other woman giggled a bit behind her hand, shaking her head. &quot;No 
it&#39;s not. I had some before. It&#39;s nauseatingly awful... thanks for 
saying that, though.&quot; Adrian&#39;s head snapped up straight, as she 
remembered something. &quot;Oh! I, uh, didn&#39;t know if you liked coffee or tea 
more, so I... I made both.&quot; A pot of dark, rich liquid sat in a nearby 
coffee-maker, while a kettle Franziska owned was gently whistling as a 
soft flame danced along its ceramic underside.

Franziska suddenly felt very strange, as if this weren&#39;t her house, but 
a very surreal dream. &quot;I prefer tea,&quot; she said slowly, trying to figure 
out exactly what seemed so odd. &quot;I feel that coffee makes one jittery 
and prone to mistakes in judgment&#151;hardly a drink for a public 
prosecutor...&quot; She looked at Adrian, puzzled, and admitted, &quot;I... I 
don&#39;t own a coffee-maker. How did that get there?&quot;

&quot;Oh! While you were asleep this morning, I went out and bought one.&quot; She 
smiled, a bit teasingly, &quot;You&#39;ve done so much for me, Franziska... I 
felt I had to help, even with something as little and stupid as that.&quot;

The blue-haired prodigy&#39;s look of puzzlement still hadn&#39;t faded. &quot;You... 
bought it? But... you can&#39;t speak German.&quot;

Adrian held up the book she&#39;d been reading, which Franziska could now 
plainly see was a German/English beginner&#39;s guide-slash-dictionary. &quot;I, 
uh, bought this first.&quot; Putting the book down in her lap, the gentle 
American closed her eyes and recited, &quot;Guten tag. Ich heisse Adrian. 
Angenehm.&quot; Though it was spoken with a heavy American accent, Franziska 
was admittedly impressed at how almost-perfect her pronunciation was.

She nodded slowly, &quot;That&#39;s... very good. Do you speak many other 
languages?&quot;

The other woman shook her head, &quot;No, I always wanted to study them but 
never really had the chance to... so I figure, might as well start now, 
right? Why not have German as my first... right?&quot; Adrian looked a bit 
bashful, though Franziska couldn&#39;t figure out why.

Adrian bought a book so that she could learn how to ask to buy a coffee 
maker in a different language just because she didn&#39;t know if I 
preferred to drink tea or coffee...

Though Adrian was in mid-sentence about how she was finding it hard to 
get the tones right this early on, Franziska said abruptly, cutting her 
off, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Adrian looked slightly surprised, tilting her head to the 
side. &quot;Sorry for what?&quot;

Everything. &quot;...last night,&quot; admitted the younger woman, fighting the 
urge to look down at her boots. &quot;I behaved... inappropriately. I 
understand you were only trying to help me in what was already an 
unpardonably shameful state... I had no right to snap at you the way I 
did. It was not proper of me to do so,&quot; she said, maintaining an even, 
stiffly formal tone during the entire &#39;confession.&#39;

Adjusting her glasses, Adrian shook her head again, &quot;Proper... I don&#39;t 
really care for proper much anymore.&quot;

Franziska&#39;s reply was sharp and curt, more so than she&#39;d intended, 
&quot;Perhaps not, but I do. I should not have acted like I did. For that, I 
apologize.&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; Adrian trailed off, and seemed to be looking out into thin air 
at nothing in particular. &quot;Franziska, I&#39;m the one who should apologize.&quot; 
What? What could she possibly have to apologize for?! Of all the things 
Franziska had expected the American to say, that was not one of them. 
&quot;You... you said a few things to me last night that really made me 
think. You told me that you were aware of the consequences I faced 
because I trusted you, right?&quot; Franziska didn&#39;t answer, because she 
really didn&#39;t need to.

The girl in the black shirt sighed softly, a wan smile on her lips. &quot;I 
had no idea you thought of it like that. That you thought my trust in 
you was... was a burden, or misplaced, or that you were responsible for 
everything I went through. If I&#39;d known you felt like that, well...&quot; she 
trailed off again, before conceding, &quot;well, there&#39;s not much I could 
have done from inside prison.&quot; Franziska flinched involuntarily.

&quot;I came out here because... because I wanted to see you. Not because I 
thought you were responsible for me or that you owed me anything. I 
wanted... I wanted to see you, and talk to you, and make sure that you 
weren&#39;t just a fantasy I&#39;d dreamed up four months ago.&quot; An extremely 
perceptive person might have noticed a slight reddish tint on her 
cheeks. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I gave you any impression that I considered any of 
what happened to me your fault, Franziska. It&#39;s not.&quot; She looked up, 
meeting the German girl&#39;s gaze with her own. &quot;I wanted to thank you.&quot;

Franziska finally found her voice, though it wasn&#39;t as strong as it 
normally was. &quot;Thank me? How... for what? I would have thought that the 
past four months would have been proof enough that you shouldn&#39;t need to 
thank me.&quot;

Adrian&#39;s voice was calm and steady, though as quiet as it ever was. 
&quot;Franziska... I deserved to be in jail. I realized that even if I hadn&#39;t 
confessed on the stand... I would have turned myself in.&quot; She looked 
away for a moment, &quot;What I did that night four months ago was selfish, 
stupid, and I didn&#39;t think it through. But even though Matt was 
guilty... I committed a crime. For me to commit a crime and hope to get 
away with it? ...I&#39;d be no better than he was.&quot;

The blonde woman frowned to herself, &quot;For four months, I rehearsed in my 
head every day what I&#39;d tell you when I saw you again... and now that I 
finally have the chance to tell you all of this, it just seems so... 
stupid and empty. I don&#39;t know...&quot; Adrian looked down at the floor 
before continuing to speak.

&quot;Franziska, I&#39;m not a strong person. I&#39;m not like you, or Mr. Edgeworth, 
or Mr. Wright... I&#39;m not. I know that... I have to depend on someone, 
and I know that there is something wrong with me... something wrong with 
how my body and brain work.&quot; Her face was red, as if admitting this was 
still hard for her to do, but kept on speaking. &quot;That... that will 
always be my cross to bear. It&#39;s not like I can wake up and change my 
outfit, or cut my hair, or decide that I suddenly want to have a career 
as a pop musician, right? I-I can&#39;t just say, &#39;Right, I&#39;m not going to 
be dependant on other people anymore,&#39; because it doesn&#39;t work like 
that.&quot;

&quot;When... when I have someone... when I had Celeste... I could keep 
going. I was almost... well, I&#39;ll never be normal but I could act like 
it. I could function on my own just as long as I knew she was there and 
I had her to lean on. And then... and then she was gone, and there was 
this hole right here,&quot; Adrian pressed a slender hand to her left breast, 
&quot;And I couldn&#39;t fill it. I...&quot; she paused again, trying to collect her 
thoughts, trying to stop the flow of words pouring out of her. &quot;What I 
said last night about it being easy to trust somebody, I wasn&#39;t 
referring to you.&quot;

She continued, &quot;I... in a weird way I almost trusted in Juan and Matt. 
Not that I trusted them, but I trusted in them. I trusted that I would 
get my revenge... I knew I would, I would avenge what they&#39;d done to 
Celeste, and I guess I thought that maybe that would fill this gaping, 
consuming hole that grew every day. That knowledge is what kept me 
going. And then... it happened. Juan was dead, and Matt was guilty of 
his murder&#151;I knew Matt was guilty... but nothing changed.&quot;

Adrian looked up, rubbing her hand across her eyes, and Franziska saw 
the shine of hastily-rubbed-away moisture on her cheeks but said 
nothing. &quot;Then...? I met you, and you were smart, and you knew what to 
do, and you told me that if I did exactly what you told me to do, I 
would be fine and Matt would be guilty. You promised me that you would 
find him guilty.&quot;

It was Franziska&#39;s turn to look away, and she could feel her shame 
piercing her chest like a knife. &quot;And... I was wrong,&quot; said the prodigy 
softly. &quot;You believed in me, and I was wrong. That was what I wanted to 
apologize for... because if you hadn&#39;t listened to me and believed what 
I&#39;d said, you would have never had to face Miles on the stand...&quot;

&quot;No! Th-that&#39;s not it at all,&quot; protested Adrian, a slight tinge of 
desperation in her voice. &quot;I... well, okay, maybe... maybe you&#39;re sort 
of right about... about it. But... you told me that, and I believed you, 
and because of that I could feel like I could keep on going, just 
because of.. of what you said. And then... on the stand, when Mr. 
Edgeworth was telling the court and the public... everything, everything 
I&#39;d worked so hard to hide about Celeste and myself and my... my 
problems. It was like he was stripping away layers of skin one by one 
and it hurt just as much.&quot; Adrian made no effort to hide the hot beads 
of liquid trickling down her cheeks. &quot;I wanted to die. I wanted... the 
earth to open up and to not be alive anymore.&quot;

&quot;But... it&#39;s silly, but I clung to what you&#39;d told me so fiercely 
because it was all I had left. And just somehow knowing that because 
there was a woman I could trust and believe in, and who... who seemed to 
actually care about me&#151;even though I know you... you probably didn&#39;t and 
I was just imagining that&#151;&quot; she stammered out hastily. &quot;That... kept me 
going. And honestly...? I spent so much time worrying about covering up 
what had happened that... when it was all out, I had nothing left to 
hide. And it felt... it felt nice.&quot;

Adrian took off her glasses, closing her eyes in thought. &quot;It&#39;s almost 
like... it was an old wound, and Mr. Edgeworth re-opened it and peeled 
off all the scar tissue and it hurt like anything else... but beneath 
it, there was healed, fresh skin, and...&quot; she laughed, embarrassed. 
&quot;That was a horrible simile, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

The two of them were silent for what felt like an eternity but was 
probably only 30 seconds, and then Adrian took a deep breath and spoke 
once more. &quot;I&#39;m not a strong woman, Franziska. You are. I&#39;m weak, 
and&#151;and I know that. But what you did... you gave me something to hold 
onto to keep myself going, and because of you, and Mr. Edgeworth, and 
Mr. Wright... well, it&#39;s easier to accept myself. I&#39;m not a strong 
person, but I&#39;m comfortable with who I am.&quot; She sniffed, wiping away 
stray tears and giving Franziska a genuine smile. &quot;I bet you must think 
everything I just said is really &#39;foolish,&#39; right? I... I had to say it, 
though.&quot;

Franziska said nothing, walking over to sit by Adrian on the couch in 
absolute silence, staring at the ceiling for a few brief eternities, 
before answering, &quot;Some of it, yes. ...not all of it. I... felt that I 
had betrayed you,&quot; she admitted at last, &quot;And that... I was responsible 
for everything you went through. Which, I am. I did... I do care. 
About... about you, that is. I felt like it was my duty to... protect 
you. Make up for what I&#39;d done.&quot;

Adrian made a sound that was half-giggle, half-sniffle. &quot;Boy... what a 
crazy pair we must seem like, huh? Anyway... Franziska, thank you so 
much. For everything.&quot;

The prodigy glanced over at the other woman, raising a blue-gray 
eyebrow. &quot;And I&#39;m sorry. Also for everything.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not... usually how it goes,&quot; nodded Adrian, &quot;But... I think I 
can accept that. Apology accepted.&quot; With that, she leaned forward, 
resting her head on Franziska&#39;s shoulder and enfolding her in a warm 
embrace.

Although taken aback, the daughter of Manfred von Karma did not 
immediately push the blonde American off&#151;as was her first inclination. 
Von Karmas do not hug. &quot;...you&#39;re welcome,&quot; she said at last, so softly 
that she wasn&#39;t sure that Adrian could actually hear her.

And then, though her moves were choppy and awkward as if her muscles 
were simply unused to the motion, she returned the hug.</pre>
