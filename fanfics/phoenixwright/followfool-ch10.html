Six months had passed since Franziska von Karma had last seen Adrian 
Andrews, in the middle of a crowded airplane terminal at the Hamburg 
International Airport. An awkward goodbye and embrace followed by a 
sudden, passionate if brief kiss, and then the blonde woman had been 
swept up in the unrelenting march of the crowd boarding the 
trans-Atlantic flight.

It had been five months since they had last talked, a brief conversation 
with a slightly-panicked Adrian relating the troubles she was facing 
regarding the art exhibit she&#39;d lined up a job managing, and the theft 
of one of the pieces. As she didn&#39;t appear to be in any real danger, and 
Phoenix Wright was getting involved, Franziska had tried not to concern 
herself further with the matter. Miles trusted the spiky-haired defense 
attorney, and while that trust didn&#39;t completely extend through the 
family tree to his older sister, Franziska did admit that Wright was 
competent enough to handle any sort of mishaps that might occur. Still, 
she discreetly tapped into some of her contacts down in Los Angeles to 
keep an eye on the situation and ensure Adrian&#39;s safety.

Other than that, the pair hadn&#39;t been in contact since the middle of 
September, and it was now a week and a half into January. Of course, 
Franziska von Karma rarely did anything unintentionally, and this long 
silence was no different. The day she had driven Adrian to the airport 
to catch her flight after three weeks in one of Europe&#39;s largest cities, 
the two had talked&#151;or rather, Franziska had talked, and Adrian had 
listened.

Her time in America, the breaking of her perfect win record, and her 
brief conversations with Miles Edgeworth had made one thing crystal 
clear to the young prodigy: ultimately, the path she was setting herself 
on would become dangerous and consuming, quite possibly destroying her 
as it had done her father. That nagging doubt had plagued Franziska ever 
since her plane had soared into the smog-covered skies of L.A, and she 
kept the assassin&#39;s calling card to remind her of that.

She had thought Miles to be weak, lost, in need of help when he had 
vanished, feigning his own suicide. She had realized, in the end, that 
Miles had actually been correct&#151;that she, and her perfection-obsessed 
father, had been wrong. Franziska had realized that she had quite a bit 
of thinking ahead of her. Unlike her little brother, though, Franziska 
would not need to fake her death to ensure precious time to contemplate 
the true meaning of being a prosecutor. No, she would continue with her 
everyday life of putting the scum of the world behind bars... she could 
deal with minor distractions, after all.

&quot;...but not you, Adrian,&quot; Franziska had sighed softly. Why was this so 
damn hard to do? She rarely put this much effort into preparing her 
opening statements for a trial, but even with all her preparation, every 
word was a labor to get out. &quot;You distract me, Adrian Andrews. I notice 
things about you that I rarely notice on anyone. I... cannot stop 
thinking about you. I cannot stop thinking about how I feel about you, 
and that is even more frustrating than the rest of it. But what&#39;s 
worse...? I enjoy being distracted by you.&quot;

Something hurt. Not the way that the bullet had hurt as it pierced her 
shoulder, no, but a far more insidious, subtle hurt like someone was 
sliding a semi-solid stiletto right between her ribs. Franziska shook 
her head&#151;foolish thoughts of a foolish woman&#151;willing each and every word 
out of her lips. &quot;And that is something I cannot afford right now, 
Adrian. Since the trial where... where we met, I have learned much. But 
I have not learned enough,&quot; she said, purposefully not looking over at 
where the blonde American sat on her couch.

&quot;There are still things I must do, things I must learn&#151;and I must do 
them alone. I cannot afford to be so... distracted by having a... 
relationship, Adrian.&quot;

Though she was outwardly composed, Adrian&#39;s voice carried a soft tremor 
beneath it that was not hard to imagine easily collapsing into a sob. 
&quot;So... you&#39;re saying, we...?&quot;

Franziska nodded. &quot;We must part as friends. Nothing more.&quot; She&#39;d never 
quite imagined that she could say something that had such a personal 
impact on herself, but the words were out there, and the stiletto was 
being twisted. Refusing to let herself panic, Franziska searched for the 
right words hastily, frustrated that they weren&#39;t coming to her as 
naturally as they normally did. &quot;Adrian, this... this is the most 
rational, reasonable choice.&quot;

&quot;Franziska, it&#39;s...it&#39;s... romance! I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve noticed, but 
rationality and reason don&#39;t really factor into it!&quot; Franziska was 
unable to keep her eyes averted any longer, and looked directly over at 
the blonde woman. Adrian wasn&#39;t crying, she wasn&#39;t hugging herself in 
fear like she&#39;d done once upon a time. She was visibly upset, of course, 
and her face was flushed with emotion, but otherwise she looked 
almost... calm.

The prodigy bit her lip. &quot;I&#39;m... aware. Adrian, it is not fair to either 
one of us to continue being lo... girlf... whatever we are. For eighteen 
years, I defined myself only in terms of my career. Now, it is... one of 
the most important things to me in this world. This is something that I 
absolutely must do... on my own. It is not fair to me to be so 
distracted... and, especially if you are in America, I will not be able 
to give you the attention that you deserve, Adrian.&quot; Her voice dropped 
to a whisper, though it was still strong. &quot;Adrian, this does not change 
how I feel about you in any way. And I would... hope that it doesn&#39;t 
change how you feel about me.&quot;

She sighed softly. &quot;I do understand, though. I will not... ask you to 
wait for me.&quot;

No sooner had the words left her mouth than the shorter woman had 
responded with a slight shake of her head, &quot;I will.&quot;

Franziska blinked in surprise. &quot;Adrian... I... you... don&#39;t know how 
long it will be. A month, or a year... or three years, or more.&quot; As it 
had only taken Miles a year, Franziska didn&#39;t really think that it would 
take her that long... though she didn&#39;t actually say that, because her 
point was made. &quot;I don&#39;t think it would be fair of me to ask that of 
you.&quot;

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t,&quot; smiled Adrian sadly. &quot;But I will... because I want to.&quot;

There was silence in the room, the two women sitting opposite one 
another, neither of them speaking.

At last, Franziska slowly spoke, breaking the quiet. &quot;I will be in touch 
with you. You can... always call me if there&#39;s trouble... you know that, 
right?&quot; Adrian&#39;s melancholy smile stayed on her face as she reached into 
her pocket and pulled out a well-folded piece of paper with only a 
number and a little message on it. She nodded wordlessly.

&quot;I will be in touch with you,&quot; repeated the prodigy. As Adrian&#39;s flight 
was rapidly approaching, they&#39;d then set off for the airport in almost 
complete silence.

Franziska von Karma turned her chair around from where she was doing 
some paperwork relating to her most recent conviction in court and 
looked out the window. Six months... twenty-three weeks, thirty-two 
trials (all of them perfectly guilty, confessing so on the stand). It 
felt somehow like both an eternity and an instant at the same time, 
which made no sense at all. The January afternoon sky was dark and 
covered in clouds, and all the forecasts were for a snowstorm that 
night. Perhaps it would be best if she didn&#39;t go home, just for 
convenience&#39;s sake.

She had been spending more time at work lately&#151;even more than she 
usually did. There was something about her apartment nowadays that 
seemed lonely and foreboding. After growing up in the sprawling halls of 
the von Karma estate, it seemed foolish to think that such a small, 
Spartan apartment could ever seem so cavernously empty and cold... but 
it did. Franziska&#39;s queen-sized bed that she&#39;d grown up sleeping in was 
suddenly too wide and too big for just her.

It was frustrating to think that Adrian Andrews could still be such a 
distraction five months after they&#39;d last spoken to one another.

The prosecutor&#39;s gaze kept flicking back to the dark, heavy sky. It was 
a timeless sky, the sort of cloud cover that could make three in the 
afternoon feel like nighttime. While working, Franziska had lost track 
of time... what time was it, anyway? Her stomach was starting to rumble 
in protest, and she couldn&#39;t remember eating anything at all, today. So, 
dinner it was.

There was that new Italian place a few blocks down from the Department 
building, but&#151;they&#39;d gone out for Italian that first Saturday... 
Franziska sighed to nobody in particular. There really didn&#39;t seem to be 
any point in the self-imposed silence now, really. The two of them 
hadn&#39;t been in contact for almost half a year, and these silly memories 
and foolish emotions hadn&#39;t ebbed at all. If she closed her eyes and let 
her iron composure wander for a few seconds, she could feel the warmth 
of the other woman&#39;s head resting on her shoulder and taste the 
ever-so-faint hints of strawberries on her lips...

If she&#39;d been the sort of person who allowed herself such flights of 
weakness, Franziska would have chuckled to herself, shaking her head 
from side to side. I&#39;m such a fool.

Yes, she was still being distracted... but she&#39;d succeeded, hadn&#39;t she? 
Over the many months since she&#39;d decided to follow her younger brother&#39;s 
example, it had dawned on Franziska that there wasn&#39;t a true &#39;defining 
line&#39; between where she had been and where she had sought to be. It 
wasn&#39;t as though she would wake up one day and suddenly know exactly 
what it meant to be a prosecutor once and for all.

It was a slow path, a steady evolution. It was continuous&#151;one could not 
expect to remain rigid and inflexible, for then one would never learn 
anything. Perhaps the entire key was adaptation, then... adapting to the 
situation. Including distractions.

Franziska stood, putting on her warm black coat&#151;von Karma or not, she 
was human, and it was rather chilly outside. Neatly arranging the 
paperwork into piles that she would finish later, she exited her office, 
locking the door behind her out of habit. There was a strange weight in 
the pocket of her coat... reaching into the pocket, Franziska was 
puzzled to find the red cellular phone she (theoretically) used for all 
of her hypothetical personal calls. She hadn&#39;t remembered picking this 
up... oh well, there wasn&#39;t really any point in putting it back. There 
was no harm keeping it on her.

With a soft beep, the elevator&#39;s doors opened&#151;there was a figure inside, 
a large, broad-shouldered man in a long white coat. When he saw her, 
Hans Ernst smiled broadly. &quot;Evening, Miss Prosecutor.&quot;

The prodigy nodded in response, stepping into the car beside him. &quot;Good 
evening, Patrolman.&quot; She paused, shaking her head and giving the 
slightest of embarrassed smiles. &quot;Forgive me... it&#39;s Detective now, 
isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Hans grinned again, reaching into the coat pocket and pulling out his 
shiny new badge that he seemed fond of flashing to anybody who would 
look at it in the two or so weeks since his promotion. &quot;It is, Miss 
Prosecutor! Thanks for remembering!&quot; The good-natured policeman laughed 
heartily. &quot;I&#39;ve been brushing up on my skills by watching old detective 
movies!&quot;

Franziska was about to say that she didn&#39;t think those were quite the 
best resources for honing one&#39;s crimesolving abilities, but before she 
could speak, the tall detective launched into what was clearly a 
well-rehearsed routine, complete with stereotypical Brooklyn accent and 
all. &quot;So... where were you on the night of January 12th, pal?!&quot;

CRACK!

Despite the relatively small, enclosed space, Franziska had nonetheless 
managed to get quite enough power into her strike, causing the young man 
to yelp and jump back in a mixture of pain and fright. The prosecutor 
held the whip above her head threateningly, an absolutely livid scowl on 
her face.

&quot;Don&#39;t you ever say that word, Detective!&quot; threatened the prosecutor, 
giving a tug on her lash to emphasize the command.

Trying to shrink back into the corner of the elevator (not an easy thing 
to do with his size), a terrified Hans shook his head, holding his hands 
up in front of his face protectively. &quot;W-w-w-what word?!&quot; he stammered. 
&quot;P-pal?!&quot; When Franziska made a motion like she was going to repeat the 
strike, he nodded furiously. &quot;O-okay! I won&#39;t say it! I won&#39;t say it!&quot;

In one smooth motion, the whip was curled and tucked under Franziska&#39;s 
coat at her side. &quot;Good,&quot; said the prodigy calmly (the silent threat 
never leaving her voice or face, though) as the doors opened on the 
ground floor, throwing the frightened and confused detective a curt nod 
as she exited the elevator.

Franziska pulled the large coat around her as she stepped into the 
frigid evening air, turning right and walking down the street. Perhaps 
she would find a new establishment... somewhere to eat that wouldn&#39;t 
distract her so much?

Then again... maybe distractions weren&#39;t so bad after all. It seemed 
more and more likely that she couldn&#39;t entirely avoid them, anyway. But 
she&#39;d managed... and she would continue to manage.

Her hand was cold&#151;looking down, Franziska found that she&#39;d pulled the 
red cell-phone from its nesting place in her pocket. The prosecutor 
stopped walking, frowning to herself as she idly tapped through the 
different menu options, because she hadn&#39;t remembered grabbing it in the 
first place (nor did she remember ever intending to do these things).

The very first name in the list, illuminated in bright blue letters, 
shone brightly through the darkening winter evening. A. Andrews.

...her thumb hovered over the &#39;call&#39; button hesitantly, though Franziska 
willed it to not descend. Did she need more time? Was she... ready? Can 
I adapt?

A brief fleck of white passed by her vision, and Franziska reflexively 
looked up to the slate-gray sky as the snowflake was joined by thousands 
of thousands of its brethren. The white particles lazily drifted through 
the sky, catching the muted light of the city streetlamps. All around 
her, the world seemed quieter, hushed somehow. The prodigy stood there 
for a moment as snowflakes alighted upon her face and blue-gray hair and 
nose and lips that still bore the faint taste of strawberries.

Franziska smiled softly at nothing in particular, raising the cell-phone 
to her ear and pressing the &#39;call&#39; button.</pre>
