<h1>Follow the Fool (part 6 of 10)</h1>

fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cantfake.html">CantFaketheFunk</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../phoenixwright/followfool-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;You are not my daughter.&quot;

The voice was deep and rough, a rumbling, gravelly bass that one felt as 
much as heard. It was oddly calm, though anyone who knew the voice well 
could pick up the inflections that suggested a deep, hot streak of anger 
and disappointment. So much was contained in the subtle tones, that the 
voice would often influence people&#39;s emotions and attitude without them 
being aware of it. It was a hypnotic, powerful voice that wormed its way 
past one&#39;s defenses before striking like an unseen serpent at its prey.

Franziska von Karma knew those hidden inflections well. Her father&#39;s 
voice was maddeningly calm on the outside, but carried with it 
undercurrents of rage and disappointment. In her mind, the bass rumble 
was the dark thunder-clouds looming ominously overhead, the harbingers 
of the coming storm. The little girl willed herself to stop trembling in 
abject terror and didn&#39;t entirely succeed. Manfred von Karma&#39;s 
infuriatingly calm voice was as potent a psychological torture as ever 
devised, and an increasingly vocal side of her wanted to break down and 
beg for the punishment to come, to be over with. Franziska knew that if 
she did that, though, it would be even worse.

&quot;You are not my daughter. You are not what I have raised you to be,&quot; her 
father repeated, holding up a piece of paper in front of the young 
girl&#39;s face, silently demanding that she look up and face it. Though 
every nerve in her body screamed at her to look away in shame, Franziska 
forced herself to look up at the red line angrily slashed across the 
middle of the page.

In his efforts to forge a worthy successor, Manfred von Karma would 
often test Franziska and her companion, the young man standing off to 
the side silently. He would ask them questions that they should know, 
and they would answer them. The questions were always precise and exact, 
and their answers were expected to be equally as precise, exact, and 
perfect.

There was no praise, should they answer everything perfectly correct. 
Manfred would look at it, nod, and toss it into the fireplace where it 
would be consumed by the flames. &quot;Adequate,&quot; he would say. There was no 
praise, no congratulations&#151;only adequate. Perfection was what was 
expected, what was demanded.

This time, Franziska had not been perfect. She had briefly confused the 
order of the laws of proper evidence introduction. It was a minor 
mistake, and in court would likely not be pressed or even matter at all, 
really. But it was a flaw nonetheless, and that was absolutely not 
acceptable. The harsh, blood-red line across the page marked that flaw 
and exposed it to all the world to see&#151;or at least her papa and Miles, 
which to the young Franziska von Karma, was effectively all the world. 
She wanted to break down and cry in shame, but refused to let herself 
succumb... for it would be worse if she did.

Another part of her wanted to explain that she had been up so late 
studying that she had been exhausted, and that was the reason for her 
mistake. Franziska knew that her father would never accept any excuses, 
though&#151;whatever the reason, the mistake had been made, and there was no 
judge or court of law that would say &quot;It&#39;s okay, Prosecutor von Karma, 
you&#39;re tired, we can hold this trial tomorrow.&quot; There were no excuses. 
There was perfection&#151;adequate&#151;or there was nothing.

&quot;Failure,&quot; said her father in that hateful calm voice, tinged with 
insidious fragments of disgust. &quot;Abject failure. You are weak, and do 
not deserve your last name. You are no von Karma.&quot; As Franziska forced 
herself to watch, her father slowly tore the paper down the middle 
twice, ripping it into quarters, then letting the pieces fall to the 
carpet. &quot;Look at me,&quot; he commanded, and Franziska obeyed, no longer to 
stop from quivering in fear at what she knew was to come.

For a moment, the little girl swore she could see a sadistic grin cross 
her father&#39;s face as he raised his hand high&#151;but that was foolish to 
think&#151;and slowly, inexorably, that hand descended.

Franziska&#39;s world exploded into a thousand pinpricks of light as the 
back of Manfred von Karma&#39;s hand caught her across the face in a 
powerful blow that sent her crumbling to the carpeted floor, barely 
managing to catch herself with her arms from falling prone. Sparks raced 
across her vision as the entire room blurred, a throbbing pulse of agony 
with every beat of her racing heart.

The little girl coughed as she pushed herself onto her hands and knees, 
a loud ringing in her ear&#151;and she could feel a little trickle of hot 
blood on her cheek, where her father&#39;s ring had left its own mark. 
Though the entire room spun beneath her hands despite her best efforts 
to will it steady, she fought the urge to collapse and succumb to the 
dizziness. Through the head-splitting ringing in her ears, Franziska 
dimly heard that maddeningly calm voice say, &quot;Come, boy, leave her. She 
will not be dining with us tonight.&quot;

The next thing she knew, there was a strong, warm arm and shoulder 
beneath her body, supporting her. There was no transition... the arm was 
just there, raising, helping her to slowly climb to her knees... &quot;Boy, I 
said leave her! The weak are not worth your trouble! Are you listening 
to me?&quot;

Yet there was no reply, only the warmth and strength of that arm that 
Franziska clung to as the world swam back into focus. Blinking, her gaze 
met the eyes of Miles Edgeworth, her younger brother. He gave the 
subtlest of smiles as he helped the young girl steady herself, either 
oblivious to Manfred von Karma&#39;s growing ire or choosing to temporarily 
ignore it. Franziska&#39;s eyes grew wide and she tried to shake her head in 
warning, though it didn&#39;t actually come out...

If there were one thing Manfred von Karma tolerated even less than 
imperfection, it was disobedience. Seeing that she could stand on her 
own, Miles Edgeworth stood up straight, turning to face the elder 
prosecutor, whose infinite composure was clearly masking a frightening 
rage beneath. Franziska wanted to protest, to shield her little brother 
from the impending catastrophe, but knew that there was nothing she 
could do, even if she had the strength.

Von Karma&#39;s wooden cane was little more than a prop, and he would often 
eschew its use while not in public. However, it was nevertheless with 
him... and Miles Edgeworth stood straight and calm as the cane swept 
through the air to catch him on the side of his head. Miles staggered, 
his legs bending beneath him&#151;and then a second strike knocked him to the 
floor, where he lay motionless for a few terrifying seconds before 
stirring weakly.

Enraged, Manfred von Karma strode to the dining table, and swept the 
plates and food off the wooden piece of furniture with his cane, a 
thunderous crash echoing through the hallways of the von Karma estate. 
&quot;Neither of you two failures may dine with me tonight&#151;or at all, until 
you prove to me your worth,&quot; he hissed, before calling to the servants 
to come clean the mess up and feed the food to the dogs. With that, 
Franziska&#39;s father stalked off, leaving the two children behind.

There was no transition&#151;a rather jarring sensation, to be sure&#151;and 
Franziska suddenly found herself sitting at the kitchen table opposite 
Miles, whose face was bruised and swollen from her father&#39;s cane. She 
squeezed the excess water out of a washcloth before taking it and 
cleaning the dry blood off his forehead and cheek.

&quot;Fool...&quot; she spat out in white-hot anger, even as she cleaned and 
dressed the wounds he&#39;d received for daring to help her up, ignoring the 
own small cut and bruise on her own face. The older sister should always 
care for the younger, more foolish brother first, of course. &quot;You... you 
should know better, Miles...&quot; was all she said in that trembling fury.

The room spun again, and Franziska found herself alone in a room, with 
no Papa, no Miles. It was a large room, filled with books and reference 
manuals, but otherwise bare, devoid of any personality&#151;no pictures or 
ornamentation on the walls of any sort other than the eternally burning 
fireplace opposite the large, barren desk in the center of the room.

Franziska recognized it as her father&#39;s private study. She had only been 
in it a few times, she knew... it was surprising how vivid and alive it 
seemed, even then. As she walked gingerly through the empty room, cold 
and frigid despite the crackling fire, Franziska caught a glimpse of 
herself in the window&#39;s reflection. She was an adult, a grown woman...

...that made no sense. She had not seen her father for three years, and 
had not returned to their ancestral estate for even longer. Franziska 
stood in a place she had rarely seen, in a time when she&#39;d never been 
there... it was jarring and disorienting, but somehow felt right.

A memory...? No...

The young woman noticed a lone picture on her father&#39;s desk that she 
hadn&#39;t remembered ever being there, and walked over, picking it up and 
examining it. It was a faded photograph in a dark black frame of two 
people... one, dressed in a tuxedo, was undoubtedly her father, though 
far in the days of his youth. The other figure was female, in a pure 
white wedding dress.

Mother...

Though Franziska could recognize every detail of her father&#39;s face in 
the photograph, her mother&#39;s head was blurry and out of focus, and she 
could barely make out the lines of what would have been a human face. 
The young woman had long blue-gray hair, identical to her daughter&#39;s in 
color if not style or length. Though she couldn&#39;t see any details, 
Franziska thought that she seemed... sad, somehow. Manfred von Karma 
certainly didn&#39;t seem happy even as a young man on his wedding day, but 
dour and serious as usual.

Franziska couldn&#39;t remember what her mother had looked like. This 
picture... it was dim and foggy, but she thought she remembered her 
sister taking it with her when she went off to study at University. She 
hadn&#39;t talked to her sister in many, many years.

&quot;She was weak,&quot; came a soft, bass rumble from behind her. Startled, 
Franziska turned around quickly, the picture flying from her fingers and 
falling to the floor, clattering across the hard wood to rest at the 
black boots of her father, who she hadn&#39;t heard enter. It was almost as 
if he had just materialized behind her, a dark, cruel grin on his face 
as he picked up the black picture frame, almost casually.

&quot;A weak woman who tried to interfere with my plans. She sought to shield 
our first daughter from me, conspiring to hold her back from the 
greatness she was heir to as a von Karma. I could not risk the same 
thing twice... so after she served her purpose, I cast her aside&#151;she 
would not interfere with my shaping a true successor.&quot; To punctuate his 
words, Manfred von Karma flung the picture-frame into the fireplace, 
where the paper shriveled and twisted faster than what Franziska thought 
was normal.

As the picture burned and died, Franziska thought she saw long blonde 
hair on the figure that was now standing where her mother had been.

Manfred von Karma took a step towards the young prodigy, who reflexively 
stepped away. &quot;And now what do I see? My own flesh and blood succumbing 
to the same temptations. Falling for a weak, insignificant woman who 
will only taint the bloodline with imperfection. It&#39;s disgusting.&quot; As he 
spoke, that same diabolical grin never left his face.

&quot;F-falling for?&quot; stammered the young woman, every step backward matched 
by her father stepping forward. &quot;I... I don&#39;t know what...&quot;

Her father cut her off. &quot;Spare me, child. I did not raise a successor to 
be an idiot. But then again, I have apparently not raised a very good 
successor, have I? Look at you. Pathetic. An imperfect failure. Not only 
were you bested by that bumbling idiot Wright... but now another loss to 
that buffoon of a defense attorney here in Germany. In your homeland. 
You&#39;re pathetic, girl. You are not worthy of being called a von Karma.&quot;

Franziska found herself against the wall of the study, with no more room 
to back up. &quot;I... I am a von Karma... but... the defendants... they were 
innocent, Pap&#151;&quot;

With a roar, Manfred von Karma jabbed out with the butt of his wooden 
cane, striking Franziska in the shoulder, directly where she&#39;d been shot 
not half a year before. The blue-haired girl cried out in pain, 
clutching at her old wound, sinking to the floor where she lay, 
trembling in terror of that nefarious grin and torturously deep voice. 
&quot;YOU ARE A PROSECUTOR!&quot; howled her father, a dark rage surrounding him. 
&quot;You decide who is guilty and who is innocent! You are the law!&quot;

He struck her in the shoulder once more, and Franziska cried out in pain 
once more. &quot;Do you understand me, child?! If the suspect is innocent, 
you do not put him in the defendant&#39;s chair. Whomever is in the 
defendant&#39;s seat, though... is guilty. You will prove him guilty, 
whatever it takes. That is perfection. That is what it means to be a von 
Karma, girl.&quot;

Franziska&#39;s face flushed as she attempted an angry glare. &quot;You... 
that... is not... how it works,&quot; she bit out every word. &quot;That is not 
how it should be!&quot; She shook her head intensely, dredging up courage 
that she didn&#39;t really feel to continue speaking. &quot;If... if that&#39;s what 
it means to be a von Karma, then...&quot;

Manfred looked almost amused in that diabolical smirk. &quot;Then you don&#39;t 
want to be one?&quot; He struck her shoulder once more, eliciting a gasp of 
agony from the girl. Her shoulder felt... hot, and wet. Franziska looked 
over to see a large red stain spreading, soaking through her white 
blouse... she grabbed at the gunshot wound, trying to stem the flow of 
blood, but it seeped through her fingers, a bubbling hole.

Even as she tried to stem the tide, she saw a similar red stain start to 
spread across her father&#39;s shoulder, though Manfred von Karma didn&#39;t 
seem to pay it any attention. &quot;Yes...&quot; he hissed malevolently. &quot;Which is 
it, child? Are you a von Karma... or aren&#39;t you? A flawed, imperfect, 
weak heir to the greatest of bloodlines... or nothing at all?&quot;

&quot;After all, girl, the sins of the father... are the sins of the son.&quot; 
Her father&#39;s teeth bared in a chillingly hateful grin, the grin of a 
predator about to pounce on its prey. &quot;Or the daughter. This wound is 
just one of the things we share... you and I. You do not deserve your 
name. You should let the weak ones falter and discard them... toss them 
away after they have served their purpose.&quot;

His cane impacted her wounded shoulder once more, a pain so intense and 
dreadful that Franziska thought she would die from the agony alone. 
&quot;Which is it? You are... a prosecutor. You are a von Karma. Toss that 
girl to the side... or are you not my daughter? Are you just another 
pathetic wretch...?&quot; With a maniacal laugh, Manfred von Karma slammed 
the butt of his cane into her shoulder yet again&#151;

&#151;Franziska&#39;s eyes snapped open as she gasped, a strong, sharp intake of 
air.

It was dark, she was lying in her bed in her small apartment, alone. A 
nightmare...? Just a bad dream...? Her shoulder throbbed in pain, a 
particularly vivid pain that was as bad as any Franziska could remember 
after the actual injury. Franziska could feel her heart racing, her 
chest rising and falling quickly as she gasped for breath, and beads of 
cold sweat dotting her forehead.

The prodigy slowly sat up in her bed as she tried to compose herself. 
She hadn&#39;t had a nightmare like that about her father in... well, in a 
very long time. It had seemed so vivid and real, though... like a 
memory, even though that could have never actually taken place. 
Franziska grabbed her shoulder with her left hand, gently squeezing and 
massaging the tender skin, trying to rub the pain away.

Franziska shook her head, trying to calm her jumpy nerves. Manfred was 
long... long gone, and he would not be coming back. It was foolish to 
dream about his presence like that, merely the work of an overactive 
mind, nothing more.

There was suddenly a chill in the room despite it being late July, a 
deep cold that bled through Franziska&#39;s skin and froze her to the bone. 
Outside, she could hear the wind pick up for a moment, the nearby oak 
tree outside her apartment&#39;s rear window brushing its branches against 
the building&#39;s rooftop. One... two-three. One... two-three. It was a 
frighteningly familiar rhythm, of a man walking with a cane.

For a brief moment, Franziska felt that she was no longer alone in her 
room. Her heart racing, she shook her head vehemently. It was a trick of 
the mind, the last remnants of the shadow of her father on her psyche. 
Ghosts were irrational, they had been proven to not exist. This was... 
this was foolish.

Still, there was a presence in the room that she hadn&#39;t felt in three 
years, and knew almost too well. The specter of Manfred von Karma loomed 
nearby, silent and invisible&#151;but undeniably there.

Franziska took a deep breath, shivering despite what she consciously 
knew to be the intense Hamburg summer heat. Which is it, he&#39;d asked me. 
Am I a von Karma? Am I not...?

&quot;You always... saw things in such absolutes, Papa,&quot; she knew it was 
foolish and she was talking to the empty midnight air, but Franziska 
spoke out loud. &quot;Perfect, adequate... imperfect, shameful. There was 
black and there was white... guilty and innocent. I... I don&#39;t know if 
I... I believe that anymore.&quot;

Her voice picked up, a brief flash of passion shooting through her body. 
&quot;I am a Prosecutor. I am a prodigy, the youngest ever to pass the bar 
exam and begin practicing. I am a von Karma. I am... I am my father&#39;s 
daughter. These are facts, cold, true facts that cannot be disputed.&quot;

The young legal prodigy shook her head, raising her voice just a bit as 
she clenched a slender hand into a fist. &quot;I am all of those, Papa. To 
deny that would be... it would be foolish. But,&quot; her eyes flashed with 
intensity, glaring at nothing in particular, &quot;that is not all I am. For 
my entire life, that was what I defined myself as&#151;Manfred von Karma&#39;s 
daughter, the legal prodigy, the heir to von Karma perfection. But... I 
am more. I don&#39;t have to define myself in terms of you anymore. I am 
Franziska.&quot;

&quot;Who... who are you to say how I define me? Shouldn&#39;t a father wish the 
best for his child? Isn&#39;t a parent supposed to want greater things for 
his or her progeny than they ever attained themselves?&quot; Franziska closed 
her eyes, anger and frustration building up inside her that she had let 
dormant for eighteen years. &quot;You never wanted that for me... or Miles. 
You wanted a carbon-copy successor, or someone who was not as good. So 
that you would be the most perfect that had ever lived. Manfred von 
Karma&#151;nobody would ever surpass him.&quot;

She dropped her voice to a whisper, though it was no less intense or 
impassioned. &quot;You know what, Papa? I will be better than you. Miles will 
be better than you. And we will do it without your deceit and 
trickery... on our own.&quot;

Franziska felt a sudden lump in her throat and swallowed. &quot;You told 
Miles to leave me behind, that I wasn&#39;t worth his time. That the weak 
should be discarded and tossed aside and forgotten until they had proven 
themselves. Miles disobeyed, and you punished him.&quot;

&quot;But... Miles was right. You are...&quot; Franziska shook her head. He was 
gone, there was no present tense. &quot;You... were... wrong, Papa.&quot; She 
managed to force out despite herself, her heart pounding. &quot;All you 
wanted of me was a successor, an heir to the von Karma name. You never 
cared about anything else, as long as I gave you that.&quot;

&quot;She... that woman who might be weak but... but accepts that and wants 
to grow... she... needs me. She doesn&#39;t need a successor, or an heir, or 
a Prosecutor, or a von Karma. She needs... she needs Franziska.&quot;

She could be lying. She&#39;s weak, what if she was just saying that to 
appease your fears? Such a foolish child.

The young woman shook her head again, startled at how much that inner 
voice sounded exactly like her father. &quot;No... she wasn&#39;t. I... I don&#39;t 
know how I know, and it doesn&#39;t make sense, but... I know. It isn&#39;t 
rational, it isn&#39;t logical, but it makes sense and somehow I know it&#39;s 
right.&quot;

&quot;You were wrong, Papa,&quot; she said softly, quietly, to the air around her.

There was silence.

For once, this was actual silence, not heavy and foreboding and 
intimidating. The thick presence that had been choking, filling the 
room... was gone. The heavy specter of her father that terrified the 
young child inside the prodigy&#151;it felt light, nebulous. Franziska von 
Karma exhaled, a long, deep breath she hadn&#39;t realized she&#39;d been 
holding in.

She was thirsty. Slipping her long, bare legs out from under the 
bedsheets, Franziska slowly opened the door&#151;wincing as it gave a little 
squeak. However, the blonde woman curled up on the pull-out bed that was 
normally a couch by day didn&#39;t seem to hear it in her sleep. Adrian 
looked happy, a smile on her face, and Franziska briefly wondered what 
she was dreaming about. She also wondered why she felt her face suddenly 
flush, and not in embarrassment or shame.

Walking softly and quietly to the kitchen area, Franziska poured herself 
a tall glass of filtered water, careful not to make any more sound than 
was necessary. The water felt cool as she sipped it, and her mouth had 
been rather dry for some reason... for a foolish conversation with her 
own imaginary fears, it had left her rather shaken.

Her gaze wandered to the small figure sleeping on her secondary bed. She 
had been certain that Adrian hadn&#39;t been lying to her before... but how? 
It seemed that everything about that woman was murky and imprecise, 
irrational, illogical, and frustrating. Rationally, Adrian could have 
been lying to her, saying meaningless tripe in order to not be pushed 
away from the woman she had come to rely on. But... though there was no 
rational explanation for it, Franziska felt sure, almost exactly 
confident in what the other woman had said. She... actually trusted 
Adrian, realized the young German woman with a small bit of surprise.

Irrational, illogical, and frustrating... and somehow wonderful. 
Wonderfully imperfect.

Dammit, she was blushing again. Stop that, Franziska chided herself. 
There was no reason to... no reason to behave like a teenage girl. 
Actually, Franziska... you are a&#151;Shut up. I&#39;m more than that. Ever since 
Adrian had come into her life, things had been slightly out of control, 
with a momentum that even she was powerless to restrain for long. As 
distracting and frustrating as it was... Franziska found herself almost 
enjoying it.

Clearly, she was too exhausted to think properly. Finishing her glass of 
water, Franziska crept back down past where Adrian slept soundly, 
closing her bedroom door behind her, and sliding back into her bed, 
closing her eyes and willing herself to sleep&#151;the thought that she might 
have another nightmare never even crossed her mind. For some reason, it 
just seemed ludicrous, out of the question.

It wasn&#39;t until sleep was just about to claim her that she remembered 
something that her father had said in the dream... about her and 
Adrian... something that rang oddly true. Before she could remember what 
it had been, though, the sandman had brushed her eyes, sending her into 
a quiet, restful, sleep.</pre>
