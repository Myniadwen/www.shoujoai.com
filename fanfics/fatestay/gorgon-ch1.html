<h1>The Watching Gorgon</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../fatestay/index.html">Fate/Stay Night</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/senigata.html">Senigata</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The sound of a slap echoed through the room followed by the harsh voice 
of Shinji Matou.

&quot;Didn&#39;t I say that you should stay away from Emiya?!&quot; Another slap 
followed. The force of the impact caused Sakura to fall backwards. Lying 
now on the floor she started to sob. Why did it have to be like this?

Those were the moment where she wished that she would be back with her 
real family. In a part of her mind she hated her family for abandoning 
her, but it was just recently that she knew why they did it, and that 
caused her to rethink her hatred.

Feeling the sting on the side of her face she sobbed the first thing 
that would come to mind.

&quot;Nee-san...&quot; Why couldn&#39;t Rin come and help her, like she would have 
done years ago?

The Matou-heir sneered when he saw the girl before him sob.

&quot;You don&#39;t deserve to carry the Matou name!&quot; he said in disgust, turning 
around to walk away. He stopped when he saw Sakura&#39;s- no HIS Servant 
standing in the doorway. Her mouth, like always, formed a straight line 
and her eyes were concealed by one of her Noble Phantasm&#39;s, Breaker 
Gorgon.

&quot;Get out of my way!&quot; shouted Shinji. The Servant looked him straight 
into the eyes as if to object but moved out of the way. The Matou boy 
walked out of the room, he would probably go and run to his grandfather 
Zouken, telling him that he would win this war.

Rider looked at the still sobbing Sakura. It hurt the Servant to see the 
girl in such anguish and she wanted nothing more to comfort her, but 
knew that it would be in vain; for there would be more torture later, 
she was sure of it.

Still, there was nothing she would like to do more than ramming her 
fangs into the Matou boy&#39;s Neck and ripping him apart piece by piece. 
But she knew that coward would use the command mantras from that 
damnable book to make her stop. Those mantras he stole from Sakura!

The only comfort that she and Sakura had was that it seemed to be one of 
the better day where Shinji would only harass and hit her and not do 
anything more.

Suddenly Sakura started to shudder, grabbing her sides. The Girl gritted 
her teeth, suppressing the pain that run through her. Her hair turned an 
almost white-like shade while a dark red mark grew slowly from her neck 
across her face.

After a minute of what looked to Rider as endless pain Sakura&#39;s hair 
turned back her normal color and the mark vanished. 

The Servant kneeled down beside the girl and, it didn&#39;t matter if it was 
forbidden to her, took her into her arms. Sakura was breathing hard, 
still feeling the aftershocks of her pain. It didn&#39;t take long before 
she was sobbing again, pressing herself against the Servant.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to do this, I don&#39;t want to become this thing!&quot; said 
Sakura through her sobs. Rider only held her. She wanted to say: You 
don&#39;t have to, but the truth was that Sakura would have no other choice 
or she would die.

Rider held onto the girl till Sakura was asleep. Placing the girl softly 
onto her bed, she made her way outside.

&quot;Soon she will be ready to fight&quot; drawled the scratchy voice of Zouken 
Matou, when Rider closed the door. Looking over to the clan-leader she 
took in his appearance. He was simply hideous. His skin tone more of a 
gray then any normal human should have. His bold head littered with 
wrinkles.

But the most fearful thing about him were his eyes. A sea of black 
surrounding a white Island that would be a perfect description of what 
his eyes looked like.

&quot;And then she will do everything I say, kill who I want her to kill. 
Become my vessel when I need her to be&quot; Rider felt from the very 
beginning that he wasn&#39;t human anymore. It radiated from him like the 
smell of fish on a hot summer day.

The Servant looked at Zouken, not saying anything. The lips of the old 
Matou twitched and turned into a sadistic grin. &quot;Maybe I should use her 
just like my dear grandson does&quot;

In an instant Rider was jumping forward, baring her fangs. Just when she 
was about to kill the older Matou a black hand gripped her at the neck, 
lifting from the ground.

She looked at the long black arm that jutted out of the shadows till she 
met a skull mask.

&#39;Hassan&#39; thought Rider. It was one of the 19 Hassans, the only true 
assassins.

&quot;He he, you would do everything for your real master, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot; 
asked Zouken, stepping forward to look Rider directly into the face. 
&quot;But you should look out for what you are doing or you could easily end 
up like you did in your past life&quot;

Rider struggled in Hassans grip, baring her fangs even more, letting 
them grow. The Matou man only chuckled to himself.

&quot;Sakura is turning into a Monster that will do my bidding, maybe than 
you and her can become closer&quot; He pointed towards the brand on her 
forehead. &quot;Then you two could be monsters together&quot;

Cackling he turned around, walking down the hall. Hassan waited for his 
master to turn around the corner before letting Rider go and return into 
the shadows.

Rider gasped for air, her fangs shrinking back into normal teeth&#39;s, as 
she landed in a heap on the floor. She crawled over to Sakura&#39;s door, 
touching it. Running her finger&#39;s along the wood.

&quot;Sakura&quot; whispered Rider. Zouken was right; soon Sakura would be a 
monster, like she was in her past life.

She didn&#39;t want the girl to experience the same things she had. When she 
was summoned, Sakura was always nice to her, never judged her for her 
past life. If only the love that she started to grow towards Sakura 
would help her.

But Rider knew that she couldn&#39;t do anything but stay beside Sakura. 
Changing her position, she sat down in front of Sakura&#39;s door, with her 
back to it. She would sit here and guard the door till Sakura would wake 
up.

Taking of Breaker Gorgon, her violet eyes fixed themselves on the gray 
clouds outside. Her square pupils didn&#39;t widen when a lightning zipped 
through the clouds, followed by growling thunder.

Soon it started to rain. The Servant&#39;s eyes softened a bit, as she liked 
to watch the raindrops fall towards the earth. Maybe someday she and 
Sakura would enjoy a moment like this together.

But for now she would do it alone, hoping for better days. Till then she 
would remain the watching Gorgon.</pre>
