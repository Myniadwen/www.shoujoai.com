<p>Dressed appropriately  for school, I flew out my door with a slice of buttered toast  sticking out of my mouth and my jacket half-on. &quot;Mom, I'm going  to school early!&quot; I said, my words unclear and rather muffled.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, Mo. Good  luck!&quot; my mother called out to me, waving good bye with her  usual smile.</p>
<p>As I continued to put  my jacket on, I walked over to the side of my house where my bike was  chained up. Entering the code and removing the chain from my bike, I  hopped on it and sped furiously out of my small backyard and onto the  road. A week ago, Haruhi had given me her address, and I decided to  pay her a visit, hoping I wasn't too early.</p>
<p>I turned onto a side  street and made several more turns, finally crossing a large street  that was crowded with early-morning rush hour. Finally making my way  to a set of apartments, I stared up. &quot;Third floor, apartment  306.&quot; I smiled and let out a humble laugh, chaining my bike to a  near-by pole and running to the entrance of the apartment. This  apartment had an elevator, so after an employee showed me my way to  it, I took my journey to the third floor.</p>
<p>I walked down the hall  nervous, hoping her parents wouldn't be mad at me for coming so  early. When finally getting to her door, I stepped to it, then stared  to the right, and then to the left. I walked off, but then talked  myself into finally approaching the doorbell!</p>
<p>Ding dong.</p>
<p><em>Hm, that's a weird  doorbell</em>, I thought. But there was no answer.</p>
<p>Ding dong...</p>
<p><em>Well, I guess she's  not home.</em> I started to walk away, when a girl  jumped out the room. I screamed when I saw her face, but quickly  recovered, realizing it was just a facial mask. My face lit up red. I  had realized I made a lot of noise. &quot;Sorry, sorry!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's all right.  What are you doing here so early, Mo?&quot; She stared at me with a  face of confusion. I could barely see the expression with the green  glob on her face.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that you,  Haruhi?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yup. What's up? I  never expected to see you on a Monday. Especially at this hour.&quot;  She let out a giggle, but then widened her eyes with embarrassed  shock. &quot;I am so sorry!&quot; She rushed into her apartment,  waving for Momo to come in.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all right!  Don't worry about it, Haruhi!&quot; I laughed. &quot;You know, you've  got green glob on your face.&quot; I pointed to her face.</p>
<p>&quot;... I do!! I'm  sorry, I'll be right back!!&quot; Haruhi ran into what I guessed was  her bathroom. In ten minutes, she returned with a no-glob face. &quot;So,  Mo, what are ya doin' here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don't  knooow,&quot; I said with a silly tone. &quot;Just kidding. I thought  we'd go to school together... Hey, where are you parents?&quot; I  stared around, for the first time, noticing that she was the only one  home. &quot;Are they at work?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, where are  they?&quot; I stared at her, blinking a few times. Then, I scratched  right above my ear. &quot;My hair has been annoying me lately.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh... well, you  see... I live alone.&quot; When she said this, her words fell flat.  She stared off to the side, not making any eye contact with me.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh... should I  not ask? I'm sorry.&quot; I looked down at my feet. Then, I stepped  into her living room and sat down on her small couch. &quot;Is it  okay if I sit here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, sure! Don't  worry about me! My parents kicked me out last year, but they promised  to pay the rent on my apartment, so I'm fine!&quot; She smiled at me,  but I could tell it wasn't a sincere one.</p>
<p>I was finally learning  something about Haruhi, but it wasn't pleasant. Haruhi lives a hard  life, not one like mine. I actually have a mother. No, I don't have a  sister or brother, or even a father, but I do have one parent. I  smiled sadly at her, deciding not to bring it up again. &quot;So!  Haruhi, when will you be ready?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh.. let's  see...&quot; She glanced up at a hanging classic white clock, then  licked her lips while she made a decision. &quot;Thirty minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>Those thirty minutes  flew by quick, and soon, we were running out the door, chasing each  other through the halls, flying down the elevators, and zooming off  on our bike. Haruhi didn't have one; she normally walked to school  everyday, so I pedaled her along on the back of mine. Sure, we were  late coming to school, but it was fun!</p>
<p>When we walked into our  class room, again I got the feeling that we were being talked about.  My eyes searched the room for Sae, but she wasn't there. <em>Hm,  I wonder where she is... that's kind of funny. </em></p>
<p>&quot;Momo, they're  staring at us...&quot; I heard Haruhi whisper to me, and I nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;I know. Don't  worry. Just go to your seat. Oh, and make sure no one trips you.&quot;</p>
<p>After five or so  minutes, our teacher came in and took attendance as usual. It turns  out Sae was 'sick,' but I doubted that. She was probably modeling, or  doing something less important than school. Or maybe even setting up  a plan for us, but that last one seemed unlikely. Sae came up with  plans, usually automatically.</p>
<p>&quot;I heard her  friend's a porn star. Is that true? Are those two secret lovers? What  do they do on weekends together?&quot; I heard behind me, two girls  chatting about us. I let out a low growl, barely audible but was  heard by the two. They instantly shut up.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, I'd like to  see a porn movie with those two! The rough beach bunny and the  not-so-innocent lamb. I'd totally buy it!&quot; More rumors flew  around the room, ranging from porn star rumors to us being twins  separated at birth. All that ran through my mind was, 'Don't these  kids have a life?'</p>
<p>When the day finally  ended, I said good bye to Haruhi and asked if she wanted to come over  later, and possibly do some bargain shopping.</p>
<p>&quot;No, Momo, I  can't. I'm sorry. Maybe tomorrow, though. I have to work today, but  I'm off then!&quot; She gave me a very cheerful smile, and of course,  I returned it.</p>
<p>&quot;All right!  Tomorrow it is, then? I'll see you later!&quot;</p>
<p>That very night, I got  a call from a hospital. Turns out Haruhi was there.</p>
<p>And that I was the only  person she knew.</p>
<p>Apparently her parents  weren't alive...</p>
