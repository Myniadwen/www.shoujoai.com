<p>Walking into homeroom with Haruhi clinging to my arm, I stared  around at everyone. Don't you know that feeling you get when you feel  like people have been talking about you? Well, I had it at this very  moment. Everyone was crowded together, and when we walked in, they all  shifted back to their own seats.</p>
<p>And the teacher walked in. &quot;Ready for attendance?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Sensei.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Adachi?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chidori?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Over here!&quot;</p>
<p>Sometimes, I wish that school could be less complicated, but things are never like that.</p>
<p>&quot;Kotobuki?&quot;</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Kotobuki?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, sorry, Sensei. I didn't hear you...&quot; Haruhi told him.</p>
<p>&quot;You're getting like Adachi. Come back to Earth, okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
<p>I've  never heard Haruhi so... lifeless before. She's not being her usual  hyper, energetic self. I remember when she first came, she was filled  with life and happiness. I knew why she was acting weird, and I know, I  should tell a teacher. But for now, I'll stand up for her and do all I  can.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, class. Did you do your homework? Please set it in  this bin right here.&quot; Sensei motioned at the tray, with other papers  and folders in it, too.</p>
<p>I jumped up and put my papers in it,  then, as I walked back to my seat, saw Haruhi staring up their with no  intention of putting her homework in the bin. ‚å†Hey, Haru-chan, go  ahead... You need some good grades.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O-okay, Momo-chan.&quot; She  stepped out of her chair, and walking no farther than five steps, she  was tripped by one of the girls that Sae had brainwashed into bullying  me last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Oops! Did I do that? I'm sooo sorry, Haru-chan!&quot; she called out, and the entire class just started laughing.</p>
<p>I  frowned and stood up. I was getting sick and fed up with these people.  &quot;Shut up, all of you! Would you want to be bullied, huh?! Haruhi will  never cry, and you'll never make her! Just get a life!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aww,  Momo's such a nice girl. She always stands up for her friends!&quot; Sae  called out. Sae gave me a dirty look, but it soon cleared away to a  happy, innocent smile that she always gives her classmates.</p>
<p>I  growled, walked over to Haruhi, and picked her up and put her on her  feet. Then I dragged her to Sensei's desk. &quot;Here. Don't let them get to  you; just put your homework up.&quot;</p>
<p>I saw Haruhi smile very faintly and nod, reaching for the homework bin. She sat her homework in there nice and neatly.</p>
<p>I dragged her back to her seat, determined to not let another stunt happen to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Momo-chan?&quot; I heard Haruhi's voice whisper to me, maybe, ten minutes later.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, Haru?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks. I'm so glad I have a nice friend like you... You're the best, okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,  Haru-chan, but this is something I owe to you. As a friend. Because you  helped me out for my date, and you became my only friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why your only friend?&quot; Haruhi asked, looking dumbfounded. &quot;You're such a good one...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because,  last year, Sae bullied me. Everyone still thinks I'm a whore and a bad  person, even though they know Sae made it up. Some of these girls even  got bullied by Sae, but they still follow her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.. I see.&quot;  Haruhi scratched the back of her head and yawned. After I saw her  scratching it aimlessly for a few more minutes, I saw her eyes widen  with shock.</p>
<p>&quot;Haruhi?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mo.. mo... There.. is.. a spider... on my neck...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wha--?&quot;</p>
<p>She shrieked as loud as she possibly could.</p>
<p>&quot;What the hell is going on here?!&quot; Sensei yelled. &quot;Why are you screaming?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Get it off, get it off, get it off!!&quot; Haruhi jumped up and shook her head like she was having a seizure.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a spider on her neck, Sensei! Help her!!&quot; I yelled, but he shook his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Damn  it!&quot; I jumped up and stopped her, grabbed her head and inspected it. No  bugs or creepy-crawly things, but two bite marks. Definitely a spider  bite. I grabbed Haruhi's hand and led her into Nurse Misao's room. &quot;A  kid put a spider on her neck and now she got bit. Will she be okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,  Momo. Let me have a look at it and I'll clean it off.&quot; Misao gestured  for Haruhi to come over. &quot;Kotobuki, that's one heck of a bite, but  you'll be fine. Why don't you lay down in here for a while? You'll be  fine. In fact, call for me if you need anything.&quot; She got up and walked  to a locked cabinet, unlocked it, and pulled several tools and  medicines out. &quot;Just to make sure you're okay.&quot;</p>
<p>I turned away,  not wanting to look at it. I walked into another part of the room and  closed the curtains, waiting for Misao to be done.</p>
<p>Misao poked her head out of the curtains. &quot;Hey, Mo?&quot; She slid out of Haruhi's room.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Nurse Misao?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it what happened last year? You know...&quot; She scratched her chin and nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.. it is. Sae has every person back under her nose! I'll never get why they always follow her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well... you know what you have to do, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've  got to get them back. I wouldn't normally tell anyone this, but, I went  to Sae's middle school. In fact, I was her teacher.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot; Momo asked, tilting her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.  I saw her bullying three girls at once.&quot; She shook her head in shame.  &quot;You've got to teach Sae a lesson, a taste of her own medicine.&quot;</p>
<p>I  nodded. &quot;Yeah... I know.&quot; I sighed, and began to walk out of the room.  From here on out, it was time to make a plan, put it in action, and  possibly win. I had to win.</p>
