<p>By the next morning,  Haruhi was gone. I assumed she was out shopping or something, and  that I was to stay home and wait. I stayed under Haruhi's warm  covers, still naked, and I watched TV. Although I was watching  television, I wasn't truly paying attention. My mind was on the fact  that--down to even Kairi--I had been betrayed by every single person  I knew, with the exception of Haruhi and my own mom. Things were  becoming complicated for me. I even turned lesbian and lost my  virginity to a strange guy!</p>
<p>When Haruhi came home  hours later, she looked exhausted. She stared at me and smiled  dreamily, and I returned the sweet smile. &quot;Momo! Good.. morning!  Since we didn't have eggs the other day, why don't we have them now?&quot;</p>
<p>I smiled to her, got  out of bed naked, and wrapped my arms around her in a loving embrace.  &quot;Sure. Do you want me to help?&quot; I realized how much I was  changing. Becoming so much more open with people I knew, and even  less embarrassed than how I used to be. Just a simple kiss used to  frighten me. But this was my last year of high school, I might as  well enjoy it.</p>
<p>Haruhi blushed gently,  but hugged me back as well and kissed my lips. &quot;I love you,  Momo!&quot; She giggled, then slipped out of my embrace and into the  kitchen. &quot;You can help if you want.&quot;</p>
<p>I followed persuit,  coming up behind Haruhi once more and hugging her from behind,  nuzzling her cheek. &quot;I love you, too.&quot; Then I released her,  running to the counter and sorting out the bags and what was in them.  &quot;We should probably put these up first, though...&quot;</p>
<p>She nodded and did the  same as me, arranging the foods in the fridgerator and freezer neatly  while I cracked the eggs and cooked them in the skillet.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know how  to prepare this, so you have to take up for me now. All I can do is  crack the eggs!&quot;</p>
<p>We both giggled, and I  spent the next twenty minutes getting a cooking lesson for American  breakfast foods.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! So <em>that's</em> what you do!&quot; I watched her flip the egg over, then sprinkle  some pepper on it for taste.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you don't  really have to sprinkle pepper on it. I just think it's good.&quot;  Haruhi grinned and used some foreign utencil to remove the egg from  the skillet and onto a plate. She sat it in front of me and then  added, &quot;Don't eat it just yet!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, uh, why?&quot;  I asked sheepishly. It looked so delicious, I just wanted to dig in  right now. I dropped the 'fork' onto my plate, as Haruhi had called  it.</p>
<p>&quot;It tastes even  better with buttered toast!&quot; Her toaster pinged, and bread  popped out of it. I watched her spread butter all over it, and then  set it on my plate. &quot;Now you can dig in!&quot;</p>
<p>I munched down on the  food for a few minutes, with Haruhi staring at me the whole time. She  looked nervous. &quot;Wow, Haru-chan, this is delicious!!&quot;</p>
<p>She smiled proudly,  then proceeded to make her own batch of food. When she sat down, we  got into conversation about tickets to a festival.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey... Momo?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;About  yesterday... when you passed out... What had happened?&quot; She  stared at me intently, patiently waiting for a truthful answer.</p>
<p>I bit my lip and  continued eating my food until I was done, never lifting my eyes from  the plate. Finally, I answered. &quot;I met up with Sae.&quot;</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed an  angered look for a moment, but then they went back to her intent  glare. &quot;And?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She set me up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How? What  happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She and Kairi are  seeing each other. She had me come over yesterday to catch them in  bed, having sex.&quot; My eyes fell to the empty plate, which was  covered in crumbs and yellow egg yolk.</p>
<p>Haruhi's eyes were  still piercing me, and I could tell that she knew there was more. &quot;Is  that all?&quot;</p>
<p>I sighed, finally  giving up. I might as well tell the whole truth. &quot;She set you up  to get beaten,&quot; and I paused for a second, then added, &quot;and  she paid a guy to rape me.&quot;</p>
<p>Her eyes widened as  much as they possibly could, and then I saw her shot up into a  furious standing position. She threw off her slippers, put on some  sneakers, and was out the door before I could even tell her to stop.</p>
<p>I ran out the door to  stop her, but by the time I had a cover around my body and was out  there, she was gone. No one in the hallway but two men and a  room-cleaning maid.</p>
<p>The two men winked and  me, and I shot back into the room, locked the door behind me, and  sunk against it. When ten minutes passed, I was dressed with my hair  done, running shoes on, and I ran after Haruhi.</p>
<p>Presuming that she was  heading to Sae's house, I hopped on my bike and took the quickest  route to Sae's house as possible. If I was lucky, I could catch her  before she got there.</p>
<p>But I was wrong. When I  got there, Haruhi was always kicking Sae in the stomach and screaming  curse words at her.</p>
<p>I ran to Haruhi,  grabbed her, but she shoved me down and kept kicking. &quot;Haruhi!  Haruhi! Stop it!!&quot;</p>
<p>Sae was bleeding and  starting to fall unconscious, but Haruhi eventually stopped before  permanently damaging Sae.</p>
<p>I walked over to  Haruhi, faced her, and slapped her across the face. &quot;Was that  even necessary?! Huh?!&quot;</p>
<p>Haruhi gave me a hurt  expression, then turned away and ran down the street.</p>
<p>I grabbed my bike and  drove after her, catching up in several minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?!&quot;  she screamed at me, most of the people on the sidewalks staring at us  now. &quot;Huh? You slapped me! I guess that means it's done, isn't  it?! I only wanted to help you!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Calm down,  Haruhi... Come on!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No! <em>You</em> come on! All you ever do is worry about Sae!&quot; she yelled again,  and by now, a large crowd of people were around us, watching us.</p>
<p>I dragged her back to  where Sae was, in front of Sae's house, despite Haruhi's protests  against it. As we arrived, police were already there, along with an  ambulance taking Sae into the back of the truck. Overhearing a  policeman, he was discussing several things about how Sae might be  put into a coma if they didn't hurry.</p>
<p>By bike, I raced me and  Haruhi to the hospital to see Sae. Sae was conscious and fully  breathing when the doctors finally let us into the room. I stared at  her bruised and scratched up face, along with her wrapped up stomach.</p>
<p>&quot;So this is what  you wanted, Momo. Hell, you even paid and used Haruhi to do it for  you.&quot; Sae spat next to my feet, with a horrible and disgusting  look on her face. &quot;I mean, it's not bad enough you took  everything from me, is it? Kairi was mine. So was Touji! Even that  little foreigner you dated! All of them! Mine!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen, Sae,  you've got it all--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;YOU EVEN TOOK MY  BABY!&quot; Sae jumped out of her bed, trying to scratch off my face.  I didn't want to hurt her, so I shoved her back into her hospital  bed.</p>
<p>&quot;Your baby?&quot;  I laughed. &quot;Last time you said you had a baby, it was bullshit!  Why should I believe you now, huh?! I didn't do anything! You're the  one who had a guy rape me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stupid bitch! I  never did that! That guy did it on his own!&quot; She glared at me  evily, starting to sit up on her bed. &quot;Hey, you know, Kairi's  sex is good. You should've took it while you could've.&quot; She gave  the most evil laugh I'd ever heard, full of both happiness and  sorrow.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's go,  Haruhi...&quot;</p>
<p>But, as I turned to  walk away, I noticed Haruhi just staring at Sae. I could tell she  wanted to pounce her now and just end her, but I grabbed her hand and  started to walk away.</p>
<p>&quot;Kairi got me  pregnant,&quot; Sae said softly.</p>
<p>Both Haruhi and I  turned to her and glared at her, then walked out of the room as if  nothing happened.</p>
<p>That night, it was  Haruhi who claimed me and took me over.</p>
<p>Maybe my moans could  mend her heart as well.</p>
