<p>I sat in the hospital,  crying all night when Momo left. My doctors checked up on me a lot  for the next week, and I didn't attend school until a month had  passed.</p>
<p>Surely, Momo and Haruhi  were coming along smoothly, weren't they?</p>
<p>When I returned home,  the house was empty and no one was home. I realized that my parents  never even called to check up on me once. I wonder if anyone told  them I was hospitalized? Of course, they wouldn't care, though. They  were always busy with their jobs overseas.</p>
<p>This is how it had  always been. Ever since I was six, Mom said, &quot;Honey, we're going  on a business trip.&quot; Sometimes, they wouldn't return for a year,  and I was tossed from family to family, until I turned thirteen.  Then, I lived alone. When my parents would return, they left the next  morning without saying a thing.</p>
<p>I wasn't always this  way. When I was young, I was a sweet and kind girl. But I screwed up  somehow. My parents began to hate me and they always left me home  alone. No one taught me right from wrong, so when I messed up, I was  just abandoned. Sent to another home.</p>
<p>I lost many friends,  and never kept any for too long because of how selfish I was. I hurt  them over and over, starting rumors when they treated me wrong. I  bullied them. I put up a huge, strong front. Many people don't know  what's inside of me, they all just think of me as a backstabbing  bitch.</p>
<p>I fully accept it as my  fault, though.</p>
<p>When I returned to  school this morning, people completely ignored me. As usual, they  only act nice to me when I'm a threat to them. They just don't want  to be bullied.</p>
<p>I feel at ease when  they all parade around me like I'm the best damn thing, because I've  always been alone. Truthfully, I just want to be loved. That's also  why I can't help but steal everything from my friends, thinking that  it might bring me happiness...</p>
<p>But it doesn't.</p>
<p>Even my teachers don't  correct me when I do something wrong. Am I just that much of a lost  cause to everyone? Momo was the only one who understood me. She  realized how lonely I was, and even though I caused her so much grief  and pain, she still treated me kindly.</p>
<p>Even though I took her  man, her life, her virginity, and everything she had, she still saved  me from Haruhi.</p>
<p>I sighed gently and  thought to myself, <em>Will Momo ever forgive me?  I truly hope she will.</em></p>
<p>After school, I went to  my modeling job. Since my parents were always away, they didn't  always remember to send me money to live off of. They usually just  forgot and left me hungry. And if they came home, they forgot they  ever did it. So I had to work, even at a very young age. As soon as I  realized they weren't going to always send me money, I started  working. I got my first job underground at the age of fourteen.</p>
<p>I work at Playboy  Japan. I always thought that Japan was a funny name to call  Nippon-koku. But as usual, seeing the pink bunny on the sign, I  shrugged off the weird name. Inside, I modeled for porn ad spreads in  magazines, and occasionally was an adult video actress. It paid big,  I never went hungry. And I could usually buy things when I needed to,  such as clothes or things for my house. I never had to worry about  whether the rent was paid, as long as I worked here.</p>
<p>When I saw Momo next,  she paid no attention to me. It hurts me deeply when she does this,  and I have no idea why. When school ended, I saw her run off with  Haruhi the opposite way of Momo's house. I realized that they must  have been living together. I made a mental note to invite her over  later.</p>
<p>I arrived home at  around 6:00PM, and decided to call Momo.</p>
<p>It rang several times,  but she didn't pick up. I called a few more times before Momo angrily  picked up.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Momo...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; she  asked quietly.</p>
<p>&quot;I.. need you over  here... Please come over.&quot; I asked her sincerely, making up no  lies or excuses. I just told her the truth like I needed to.</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just do!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I'm busy.&quot;  Momo said, and was about to hang up, but I stopped her.</p>
<p>&quot;If you don't,  I'll get hurt! Please! Hurry!&quot;</p>
<p>I hung up the phone.  Yes, I lied in a way. But my heart would be hurt if she didn't come.  Me hanging up was just to add to the effect so that she would  actually come.</p>
<p>In twenty minutes, I  heard someone knocking on the door.</p>
<p>I ran downstairs to  answer it, and it was Momo. I let her in and took her to my room,  telling her to relax there.</p>
<p>&quot;What the hell is  going on, Sae?&quot; she asked calmly, like she expected more than  just me to be here.</p>
<p>&quot;One moment...&quot;  I walked out of the room for a few minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;Sae, what is  going on?&quot; I saw Momo getting uncomfortable, and she stood up,  seemingly about to leave the room.</p>
<p>I walked back in, and  Momo's jaw dropped. There I was, standing in black, lacy garments. A  see-through bra, and a thong. Stuff I had from doing adult videos. I  walked over to her, tracing my hands along the crane of her neck,  then roughly shoved her onto my bed. I snatched off all her clothes  as quickly as possible, and found her squirming to free herself  underneath my body.</p>
<p>&quot;Sae! Sae?! What  the hell is this? Get off of me!&quot; She squirmed more and more,  but I paid no attention.</p>
<p>I started to slide off  her panties, and I forcefully unhooked her bra. &quot;Momo, I love  you! You mean everything to me!&quot; When I slid off my own  underwear and bared my breasts to her, she gasped.</p>
<p>I spent the next  several hours doing unimaginable things to her, hearing her scream my  name regretfully and cry out in pain.</p>
<p>I used all kinds of  toys on her, and nibbled everything, eventually leading below her  waist and taking control of everything she had, her legs wrapped  around my head and shoulders.</p>
<p>She eventually gave in,  doing things to me as well. Riding me. Even eating me. She couldn't  help herself. And this was the most loved I'd ever felt in my entire  life.</p>
<p>I dominated her again,  getting on top of her and breaking down her walls.</p>
<p>I don't want to know  how Haruhi felt when Momo never returned home that night.</p>
<p>NOTE THAT NIPPON-KOKU IS  THE OFFICIAL NAME FOR JAPAN. It is also referred to as Nihon-koku  sometimes.</p>
