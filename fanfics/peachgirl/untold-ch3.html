<p><em>&quot;Because, Momo, I love you.&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;Y-you what?! What about Sae?!  No... You're lying!&quot; I panicked. I turned away, tempted to run.</p>
<p>He sighed slightly. &quot;I'm not  lying... Momo... I'm sorry...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Explain to me why you dumped me  for Sae!&quot;</p>
<p>He turned me around and I fought back a  little, but gave up soon. &quot;Look, Momo. Sae's... nothing to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is this what you do? Toy with  people's hearts? Make them love you? And then leave them? Is it what  you're doing to Sae, too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, damn it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're lying,&quot; I told him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he pulled me into his arms,  reaching to kiss me. &quot;I'm not...&quot;</p>
<p>I slapped him across the face, stunning  him, as I looked shocked slightly at my own actions. I, then, started  to run away towards the city, since I was closer to it.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo! Wait!&quot; he yelled after  me, holding his cheek. &quot;I do love you! I'm sorry!&quot;</p>
<p>I screamed back at him, &quot;You're  lying! It's all you ever do! Leave me alone! Stop mixing my feelings  up!&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, I crashed into somebody. That  guy... the one that saved me earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo! Wait up! Please?!&quot;</p>
<p>He finally caught up with me, as I  quietly clung to the guy I crashed into. I whispered to him,  &quot;Please... make him stop... please...&quot; I started to cry a  little.</p>
<p>&quot;Dude. I don't know your  relationship to this girl, but she wants you to leave her alone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I LOVE her! How can I leave her  alone?!&quot; Touji screamed.</p>
<p>&quot;If you love her so much, let her  go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; he screamed again.</p>
<p>&quot;Touji... I'm so sorry... but I  love this guy!&quot; I yelled to him, then grabbed his face and  pressed my lips to his quickly, then pulled away. &quot;Will that  convince you to go away? Will it?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No... you can't love him... Momo!  You can't!&quot; he yelled. He then grabbed my arm, and I felt a  force of pulling... All of a sudden, Touji was on the ground, the guy  was looking at him fiercely, and I was in the middle of this.</p>
<p>&quot;W-what just happened...?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your boyfriend just karate-kicked  me. And you... you're...&quot; Touji broke off in tears and ran.</p>
<p>I felt a heart-ache coming on. I felt  so horrible. So bad for what I did.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you okay? And what did you  mean when you said you loved me?&quot; the guy asked, his eyebrows  raised confusedly.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm... okay... just... hold me...  okay?&quot;</p>
<p>He held me and looked up, stroking my  head.</p>
<p><em>What was Sae up to?</em></p>
<p>Ha-ha! Momo's got a little boyfriend.  Now I have even more trash to throw out... around the school!</p>
<p>&quot;I-I'm sorry for troubling you...&quot;  I heard Momo say. Don't play innocent.</p>
<p>&quot;It's fine. You never troubled me.  By the way, what's your name, anyway? Momo, right?&quot; this hot guy  said. Hm. I might just have to take him, too!</p>
<p>&quot;Yes... what about... yours?&quot;  Momo asked, still choking a little. Wimp.</p>
<p>&quot;Tamaki Kioku. All right, run  along now. If you have any trouble...&quot; he slipped a card into  her hand, &quot;feel free to call my cell phone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O-okay.&quot; How the hell can  she get guys to like her so easily?! Ugh!</p>
<p>I saw Momo walk off towards her home,  and I decided to pop up.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, Momo!&quot; I said to her,  appearing behind her and grabbing her shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! SAE! What the hell?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Momo, I forgot about your  leg. I'm so sorry.&quot; I think I lie pretty well.</p>
<p>&quot;It's fine...&quot; I saw her limp  off. I have better things to do than to baby-sit her. So, I waved and  walked off.</p>
<p>&quot;Bye, Momo!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bye, Sae.&quot; she said.</p>
<p><em>Kairi!</em></p>
<p>I sighed gently and looked around. I  kicked a rock for ten minutes. I guess she wasn't coming. Who, you  ask? Misao. I didn't want to break Momo's heart, but... I loved  Misao. I still do. And I wanted her to meet me today, but she's 57  minutes late. I think I'll still wait, though...</p>
<p><em>Nothing interesting, back to Momo!</em></p>
<p>I groaned and turned on my radio. They  had an American station, and I was always curious of what they  played, so I turned it to it.</p>
<p>&quot;All right! Konnichiwa everyone,  here's Amanda Perez's Angel!&quot; I heard the radio's deejay say.</p>
<p>The track started off slowly. It was so  much different than the music I listen to. Then words came on. It  went something like this...</p>
<p>&quot;It's been five months since you  went away</p>
<p>Left without a word and nothing to say  nothing to say</p>
<p>When I was the one who gave you my  heart and soul</p>
<p>But it wasn't good enough for you, no</p>
<p>So I ask God</p>
<p>God send me an angel</p>
<p>From the heavens above</p>
<p>Send me an angel to heal my broken  heart</p>
<p>From being in love...&quot;</p>
<p>After that, the lyrics started to dig  into my heart and I turned it off. The lyrics stayed stuck in my head  as I heard the phone ring. I answered it, startled.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Momo. It's me. Your old  classmate. Do you remember me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! Hi! How are you?&quot; I  asked. I actually wasn't sure who it was, but...</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I'm fine. Listen, Momo, I  need your help.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Um, with what?&quot; I  asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Touji won't stop bothering me. He  keeps telling me to talk to you about how much he loves you.&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, I found myself squeezing  plastic in the phone. &quot;I'm so sorry. I think we're breaking  up...&quot; I hung up, and sighed. I didn't want to break her off,  but I felt I had to. I turned the phone off and put on headphones,  listening to music as I chilled on my bed. I soon drifted off into  sleep...</p>
<p>&quot;Momo? Momo? Hello?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh? What's going on?&quot; I  leaned up, rubbing my eyes. My vision was blurred because I had just  woke up.</p>
<p>&quot;Someone came to see you. I think  his name was Tamaki...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay. Mom, let him in. I don't  feel up to getting out of bed...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, hun,&quot; my mom said,  walking out of the room.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Tamaki walked into  the room, waving to me, and sat down by my desk.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi... so, uh, how did you know  where I live?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You move around a lot, and it's  easy to catch you making your way home. You stand out.&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded and blushed, looking away.  &quot;Oh.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, your crutches make it  even easier to spot you. Not to mention your unique looks...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... Thank you, I think,&quot; I  told him.</p>
<p>&quot;No problem.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So, what's up?&quot; I asked him.</p>
<p>&quot;Just working a lot. What about  you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Schooling. And surviving a lot of  drama.&quot; I told him.</p>
<p>&quot;Drama? What happened?&quot; he  asked me.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like talking about it...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. Okay. What about your leg?  What happened?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I got hit by a car.  Heh-heh. I guess I should pay more attention, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh... That sucks. Be careful,&quot;  he warned me.</p>
<p>&quot;So, how old are you, anyway?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nineteen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. I'm seventeen,&quot; I told  him.</p>
<p>&quot;Sweet.&quot;</p>
<p>I smiled and nodded. &quot;What do you  do... for a living?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I work at a flower shop,&quot; he  said, averting his eyes.</p>
<p>I nodded. &quot;Wow! You must be the  sensitive type.&quot; I laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa, whoa, I was just kidding,  okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So, Momo, what are you doing this  Friday?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing much. Um, just doing what  I've been doing, I guess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would you mind... going to the  beach with me?&quot; he asked another question.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, uh, well...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well?&quot; he questioned me.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess I could go.&quot;</p>
