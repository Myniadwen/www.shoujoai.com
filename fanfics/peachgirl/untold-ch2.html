<p><em>&quot;Momo, I...&quot; Kairi spoke  to me nervously...</em></p>
<p>&quot;Momo, I can't go out with you  anymore,&quot; he told me, looking a bit sad. Why...? Why can't you  go out with me?!</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean, Kairi?!&quot; I  screamed at him.</p>
<p>&quot;I just... can't, okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why can't you, Kairi? I thought  you loved me...&quot; I said as I turned away, tears streaming down  my cheeks.</p>
<p>&quot;I do, Momo, I do...&quot;</p>
<p>I turned to face him, instead of  crying, mad. &quot;You can't break my heart and comfort me too!&quot;  As I said that, I turned away and ran off. I ran as far as i could  without thinking of what I was doing. I ran through streets, probably  not paying attention to whether I could legally walk or not.</p>
<p>I stepped into the street, a main one,  and I wasn't paying attention. Suddenly, I heard beeps and loud  noises. Before I knew it, I had blacked out...</p>
<p><em>A couple hours later...</em></p>
<p>Where the hell am I? I looked down,  noticing the weird clothing. Hospital clothing.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Miss Adachi! You're awake!&quot;  a weird, unfamiliar voice told me.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.. I am... but... where am  I?&quot; I asked, my head hurting as I sat up.</p>
<p>&quot;You got hit by a car.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I-WHAT?!&quot; I screamed. &quot;Hit  by a car?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't remember? Honey, you  walked into a main street, not even paying attention to what was  going on and a large moving truck hit you,&quot; the lady told me. I  couldn't believe it.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh... I did?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...What were you thinking, not  paying attention?!&quot; she yelled at me.</p>
<p>&quot;I was thinking...&quot; my voice  trailed off. How could I tell a complete stranger about my problem?!  I slumped back, remembering what Kairi said to me. <em>&quot;Momo, I  can't be with you.&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;Speak up.. I can't hear you,&quot;  the lady said.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, me? I'm nurse Nakatawa,&quot;  she said with a smile. I knew it... I don't know her!</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At least you're all right. It's a  good thing! Your parents were worried sick about you!&quot; she said  to me. I made them worry... &quot;So was your friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My friend? Who?&quot; Don't tell  me...</p>
<p>&quot;Her name, I believe, is Sae  Kashiwagi.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sae?!&quot; I gasped.</p>
<p>She walked into the room, holding  flowers. &quot;Oh, Momo, what were you thinking? What happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... Nothing. What are you doing  here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I volunteered to take care of you  while you're here!&quot; she said, a smile on her face. She's lying.</p>
<p>&quot;Take care of me? I'm perfectly  fine,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, no you're not, Miss Adachi.  You have a broken leg,&quot; the nurse told me.</p>
<p>&quot;What?! A broken leg?! Does this  mean I can't swim?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly, Momo, be careful next  time!&quot; Sae told me.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; I said, in a rather  bad mood. Although, I wanted to cry and scream at her, I smiled and  kept control. I wonder what little tricks she'll manipulate me with  next...</p>
<p>&quot;Momo, you're being released  today. Because, if you haven't noticed, you already have your cast on  and everything! Go get dressed,&quot; Sae told me. I hate it when she  acts like I'm stupid.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, Sae.&quot; I got up, using  crutches to support me, and tried to find my clothing. I did, later  on, find them and got dressed.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you ready, Momo?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Sae. I'm ready,&quot; I  said, sighing.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to the park today,  okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Later...</em></p>
<p>We're finally here. My leg has never  hurt so bad before! Is this Sae's plan?!</p>
<p>&quot;Are you okay, Momo? You're  looking a little pale.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm fine,&quot; I told her. What  is she trying to say, that it's almost impossible for me to look pale  every once in a while? Oh, well.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt a hard slap across my  butt. What the heck?!</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, babe, what's up?&quot; this  hot-shot asked me. He was a blond, blue-eyed male. He was obviously  European.</p>
<p>&quot;Why did you do that to me?! Look  at me! I'm using crutches!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Calm down, Momo, he's hot,&quot;  Sae whispered to me.</p>
<p>&quot;So?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen, chick, You were just  putting it out there, and I was just putting it out that I like what  I'm seeing.&quot;</p>
<p>I blinked a moment, wondering what he  was talking about, then I looked at myself and realized that the  clothes I was wearing weren't the clothes I had on earlier! &quot;Sae!  What the heck is up with these clothes?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I set them out for you.  Remember? Your other clothes were torn up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Could this skirt get any  shorter?!&quot; I yelled at her. I felt the guy come up behind meand  nuzzle my body. I tried to turn around, but my aching leg was  preventing me from doing it! &quot;Sae! Get him off of me!&quot;</p>
<p>Before I knew it, the guy was suddenly  off of me, Sae and I were on the ground, and I was screaming.</p>
<p>&quot;That'll teach you to mess with  innocent women,&quot; an unfamiliar voice had said.</p>
<p>The owner of the unfamiliar voice  helped us both up. &quot;I'm sorry for knocking you down. But it was  all I could do to get you away from that punk before I tore him up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, oh, um... Thank you,&quot; I  said, a bit nervous.</p>
<p>&quot;No problem, beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! What the hell is going on?!  Damn it, why did you knock me down! Asshole!&quot; I heard Sae going  off at him.</p>
<p>I sighed and shook my head. &quot;Sae,  let's go.&quot;</p>
<p>The guy started walking off, but before  leaving, he turned to us and winked. Then, he left. Wait... Why did  he wink at us?!</p>
<p>&quot;Momo, you look red now! Do you  have the hots for that guy? I bet you do!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No...&quot; I sighed. There's no  getting through to Sae.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's go.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Later...</em></p>
<p>On my way home, as I was in the middle  of the city, I was deep in thought. A lot had happened today. I was  wondering if Kairi was serious about breaking up. After all of this.  There's no way... Then, I thought about Touji. How he always  protected me. How he loved me sincerely. And how he left me... Why am  I so easy to just... leave? Be dumped? I wonder if I'll ever know...  I sighed a bit. I got hit by a car today, too. How could that, of all  things, happen? It's not fair... I wondered if I deserved this all.  Or if I should've died today. Or whether I'd be better off dead or  alive. I decided that giving up is something people would want me to  do, so I'm better off alive. Then there was that guy, who was feeling  up on a girl who came out of the hospital that very day! If I could,  I would've sent him to hell! Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wh-what the?!&quot; I tried to  turn around, but instead the person calling out my name came to face  me.</p>
<p>&quot;What happened to you?!&quot;</p>
<p>It was Touji...</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, hi Touji...&quot; I smiled  weakly to him, trying to mean the smile.</p>
<p>&quot;What happened, Momo?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I... I got hit... by a truck...&quot;  I stuttered to him.</p>
<p>&quot;What?! Are you serious?! How!&quot;  he was obviously upset at me...</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to talk about it. I  have to go home...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you need help...?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would be better. But I don't  want to burden you. I'll get home by myself,&quot; I told him and  started walking off.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not a burden! And why are  you wearing such a short skirt?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sae.&quot; It was one thing I had  to say, and I said it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt myself lifted into the  air. It scared me, badly! &quot;What.. What are you doing?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm carrying you home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot; I questioned him.</p>
<p>&quot;Because, I...&quot; his voice  trailed off.</p>
<p>&quot;Because what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because, Momo, I love you.&quot;</p>
