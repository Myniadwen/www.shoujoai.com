<p>&quot;Really? You'll go  with me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah... I'll go.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Later that day...</em></p>
<p>&quot;Mom! Mom! I need  some money!&quot; I called out to my mom.</p>
<p>&quot;For what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well.. um.. remember  that guy from earlier?&quot; I asked nervously.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. What about  him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well... he asked me  out on a date...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that so?&quot;  She looked at me. Then a smile spread across her face. &quot;Great!  Maybe you'll feel better. Where are you going?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... The beach.&quot;  I looked down. &quot;I only have my school bathing suit and...  well... I want to make impressions. Good impressions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I understand. And I  guess your job doesn't pay well enough for you to buy the stuff  that'll make you look good, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't... I'm  sorry, mom. Forget it.&quot; I sighed gently.</p>
<p>&quot;No! No! It's not a  problem. I understand. The job you got <em>is</em> just a clerk at a drug store. It doesn't pay that well, I take it.  Here.&quot; She reached out her hand to reveal 10,000 yen bill.</p>
<p>My eyes lit up. &quot;Not  that much! I can't take--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Take it,&quot; she  ordered me.</p>
<p>&quot;... All right.&quot;  I took it from her and walked out the door. &quot;Thanks, mom!&quot;  I pulled out my cell phone. &quot;Who could I call?&quot; I sighed. I  decided to go by myself; Sae wasn't the best for advice.</p>
<p>I stepped onto the local  bus and took a seat in the mid-section. Riding by yourself isn't  terribly safe, but I didn't think anything bad would happen.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I was snapped  out of my thoughts by a high-pitched, happy-sounding voice. &quot;Is  this seat taken?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, well, no. It's  not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; 'Kay! Thanks! There  weren't any others that weren't taken,&quot; she took a seat, &quot;so  I thought I could sit here. My name's Haruhi, but you can call me  Haru. What's yours?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.. I'm Momo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, hiyah, Momo!  Nice to meet you!&quot;</p>
<p>I looked down. She seemed  nice, but after all the drama with Sae, I wondered if she was as nice  as she seemed... &quot;It's nice to meet you too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So what're you doing  on here all alone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, my friend was  busy, so I was going to the mall to buy a bathing suit,&quot; I told  her calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Mind if I tag along?  I was heading home but I don't mind shopping! Tee-hee!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p>
<p><em>What happened to Kairi?</em></p>
<p>Sigh... &quot;She never  came. I wonder why...&quot;</p>
<p>I looked down at my watch.  I waited nearly 8 hours for her. I felt kind of desperate and a  little idiotic for waiting so long.</p>
<p>My phone started  vibrating. I never felt it, though. <em>Doo-doo-doo,  do do do, do do, do do.</em></p>
<p>I heard my ringtone go  off. I opened my phone and pressed it to my ear. &quot;Hello?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's me, Ryo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah? What do you  want?&quot; I suddenly felt mad. I wonder why he decided to call.</p>
<p>&quot;Heh. Misao didn't  show, huh?&quot; I heard his smile through the phone.</p>
<p>&quot;What did you do?!  Huh?! What?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, don't worry...  Just got her pregnant, is all. You're an uncle now, little bro'.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You little  bastard... Why did you do it?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was all in a  day's work. Don't worry. You can forget about having her. Go back to  Momo.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Beep beep beep.</em></p>
<p>He hung up.</p>
<p>I tried to call back, but  each time, I got the answering machine. I did the same for Misao, but  she never answered, either. Why?</p>
<p>&quot;Damn it... why? Why  does he do it? Why to me?&quot; My head hung low and into my hands as  I slowly started to cry.</p>
<p><em>And Momo was doing?</em></p>
<p>&quot;Momo! You look  awesome in that! But I know you can do better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really? All right!&quot;  I laughed. I haven't felt this good in a long time. I finally found a  friend...</p>
<p>I saw Haru-chan pull out a  pink and blue two-piece bathing suit, including a tight-at-the-side  wrap. &quot;You'd look grrreat in this!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You think? Okay,  I'll try it on!&quot;</p>
<p>After about ten minutes, I  walked out the dressing room. &quot;How does it look?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's perfect! Momo,  you look hot!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Seriously?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah!&quot; she  smiled. &quot;Who are you trying to look so hot for, anyway?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His name is  Tamaki... Tamaki Kioku.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa, sounds hot.  How old is he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nineteen.&quot; I  bit my lip.</p>
<p>&quot;I bet he's hot! He  has to be!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is.&quot; I  giggled.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Momo. Give me  your cell phone number. Let's keep in touch. Maybe we can hang out  again. You're way cool.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot; I  wrote down on a piece of paper my number. &quot;Yours?&quot;</p>
<p>She grabbed the paper and  giggled, pulling out a paper to do the same. &quot;Here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll see you around!  Thanks for the help!&quot; I ran off, waving behind me.</p>
<p>&quot;See ya', Momo!&quot;</p>
<p>When I made it home, I  felt so happy. I felt good. Better than ever.</p>
<p>&quot;How'd it go, Mo?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good, mom. I made a  new friend too...&quot; I broke off, pulling out my bathing suit and  sandals I just bought, &quot;and this is what I bought, and what she  helped pick out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's killer cute!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks, mom. For the  money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're welcome.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Friday...</em></p>
<p>The doorbell rang. I bit  my lip nervously, and opened the door. What stood before me was a  hansome, rather hot guy in green and black trunks.</p>
<p>&quot;You ready to go,  Mo?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I'm ready.&quot;</p>
