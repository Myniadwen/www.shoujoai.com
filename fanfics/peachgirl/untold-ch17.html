<p>&quot;Hey, did you  hear? Momo and Sae were caught doing it last night!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Seriously?  By who?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know! But  they said they heard a scream and came to check it out, and saw Sae  and Momo all over each other, orgasming and everything! It's sick!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Totally!&quot;</p>
<p>When I walked into the  classroom, instead of people avoiding me, everyone walked right up to  me, asking about what I did last night. I denied everything and told  them to shut up, then went to my desk. The whole day, all I heard was  people gossiping about me and Sae. I'm glad Haruhi was left out of  it, though.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Will  Momo Adachi please come to the office</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>In second period, I was  brought back to reality by the loud speaker system, asking me to come  to the office. I nodded to my teacher, stood up and left the room,  with people behind me whispering about more things.</p>
<p>Traveling down the hall  and finally finding the office, I walked in.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo? Oh, we've  been expecting you.&quot;</p>
<p>It was entire staff of  people in the office, all of them staring at me as if I were a  disease. I sighed. &quot;Look, I'm sorry about--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You left your ID  booklet in here!&quot; the principle exclaimed.</p>
<p>My eyes widened and I  checked my pockets, then breathed a sigh of relief as I realized he  was being honest. &quot;Oh, I'm sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. We found it  in the storage room. It's sweet that you want to clean up your  classroom after hours, but please do it in class next time. That's  all.&quot; He handed me my ID booklet and shooed me out of the room,  the door closing behind me.</p>
<p>I thought I was busted.</p>
<p>I walked back up  stairs, and was surprised that time flew by so quickly. It was break  before third period. I sat in the hallway, staring at my ID, although  more in thought about what I was going to do.</p>
<p>Should I really be a  two-timer?</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, lesbian. We  saw you yesterday. With Sae. How dirty! No wonder Sae knew you were a  lesbian, she was the one you were doing it with!&quot;</p>
<p>As I heard a voice and  laughter from above, I raised my head and felt a slap across my  cheek. Several girls from lower classes were standing in front of me,  laughing in my face about me. &quot;What the hell do you want?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. Just wanted  to say hi, lesbian.&quot; The center blond girl began walking away,  with her groupies following after her.</p>
<p>&quot;She didn't even  deny it! I totally knew it! She <em>is</em> a lesbian!&quot; one of the girls had said, and I buried my face in  my arms.</p>
<p>The day went by slowly  after second period. I left the school on my bike, riding towards  Haruhi's house as usual. If she was doing what she normally did,  she'd be at the super market buying foods to cook this afternoon.</p>
<p>This left me plenty of  time to do what I had to do.</p>
<p>I went to her apartment  on the third floor and opened the door, finding an empty house. It  was perfectly normal. I smiled sadly.</p>
<p>I traveled to Haruhi  and I's room, slid open the closet, and packed my clothes. Time was  going to be rough for the next month, but at least we were on break  and I wouldn't fail school because of this.</p>
<p>When I was finished  packing, wallet in hand, I left the apartment. My keys were in my  bag. I had planned to return someday, just not yet. &quot;This is  going to be hard... It really is.&quot;</p>
<p>I stepped out of the  lobby and outside into the real world, approaching the street and  whistling for a cab. When one pulled over, I hopped it, told the  driver where I'd be going, and drove off.</p>
<p>&quot;What's a pretty  girl like you doing in here, driving to a place like that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I decided I  needed a break.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds like a  good idea.&quot; The cab driver looked at me and smiled, then faced  the road.</p>
<p>I had a feeling  troubles were lying ahead.</p>
