<p><em>&quot;You ready to  go, Mo?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Yeah, I'm  ready.&quot;</em></p>
<p>He threw his arm around my  waist, and I looked down. I was terribly nervous. <em>Please  let everything go okay...</em></p>
<p>&quot;So...&quot; he said,  keeping his eye on me.</p>
<p>&quot;What... kind of  music do you like?&quot; I asked. Not exactly a great question to  ask, but it popped into my head first.</p>
<p>&quot;I like anything but  country and classical. Bleh,&quot; he said, pulling me close. &quot;What  about you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Same...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot; I saw  his gaze turn to my face with curiousity.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said,  still looking down. By now, we were at the train stop and heading to  the beach. . . where I saved Kairi once before. I sighed.</p>
<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right. C'mon,  let's go!&quot;</p>
<p>He pulled me onto the  train that just pulled up and I nodded. We sat next to each other,  and I noticed one thing: everyone was staring at us, making comments  like, &quot;Oh, look at the beach bunny. I bet he's only into her for  sex,&quot; and, &quot;Where'd she get that tan? I bet she tans every  single day. Whore.&quot; I suddenly felt a bit angered and upset, so  I sat back in the train seat to hide my face.</p>
<p>&quot;What's wrong? You're  acting different,&quot; he asked once more.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing, all right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay...&quot;</p>
<p>Once we made it to the  beach, I immediately ran straight for the water. Tamaki ran after me,  splashing me. I dunked him under the water, and he popped up and  dunked me. It was pretty fun.</p>
<p>I could've gone on like  that forever, but I was getting hungry.</p>
<p>&quot;Want to get a bite  to eat? We can come back later.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; I said,  smiling. He was a pretty nice guy, if you asked me.</p>
<p><em>Sae, where on earth  have you been?</em></p>
<p>At the diner, I sat at a  near-by table, hiding my face with a menu. &quot;Oh, little Momo has  a new boyfriend. Ha ha ha!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Momo, what do you  want to get?&quot; I heard that guy from the park ask her. Never knew  they had a thing for each other.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh... how about  chicken teriyaki? Or sushi? Maybe some wasabi?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, but that's a  lot to eat. Wanna' share?&quot; he asked her. Does she always get the  good guys?</p>
<p>&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
<p>I listened intently for a  while, eavesdropping on their conversation. I was whispering comments  to myself, and I didn't even notice everyone giving me the eye. I  ignored them, still making comments and such. I was snapped out of my  thoughts by a tapping on my shoulder. &quot;WHAT?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.. oh, ma'am,  ready to order?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm NOT ordering  ANYTHING here if those BASTARDS don't stop STARING at me!&quot;</p>
<p>I smirked some, expecting  them to shut every one of those bastards' eyelids, but instead, they  kicked me out. What the hell? I decided Momo and that guy would leave  sometime soon, so I waited near-by for them to leave.</p>
<p>After about thirty  minutes, which took long enough, they FINALLY came out.</p>
<p>I followed them back to  the beach, giving them ten minutes to cool down and get into the  pool.</p>
<p><em>Section: Peach Girl</em></p>
<p>&quot;Ah-ha-ha! This is so  fun!&quot; I splashed him and ran along the shore from him as he  chased me to splash me back. &quot;Can't catch me!&quot; I dived into  the water, and he followed after me. I kept swimming and swimming  until I found myself back at shore. I ran around until he finally  grabbed me from behind.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! Gotcha!&quot; he  laughed some. &quot;Now what?!&quot;</p>
<p>I giggled as he held me  and smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo, dear!!&quot;  Suddenly, I heard my name called out, and out of nowhere, a Sae  popped up.</p>
<p>&quot;Ack?! What are you  doing here!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?  Remember, you told me to meet you here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never said  anything!&quot; I cried out. What the heck was she thinking?! Trying  to ruin my date?!</p>
<p>&quot;Momo, if you invited  her, it's okay... Maybe you forgot?&quot; Tamaki asked me.</p>
<p>&quot;No! I haven't talked  to her since I got hit by a truck, 2 months ago!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Momo, you liar!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, hey, no  accusing Momo! Who are you anyway?!&quot; Tamaki questioned her.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm Momo's best  friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hardly!&quot; I  yelled out. &quot;You're trying to ruin my date! What're you going to  do, spread news about me sleeping with him at school, or something?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would never do  that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now who's the  liar?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;CALM DOWN!!!&quot;  Tamaki yelled out.</p>
<p>Both Sae and I silenced.</p>
<p>&quot;What the HELL is  going on, Momo?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You wouldn't  understand...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Try me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't lie, Momo, you  harrassed me during my whole school year. Why are you lying all the  time? Why do you always do this?!&quot; I rolled my eyes as Sae  started her fake crying.</p>
<p>&quot;You're the one who's  lying.&quot;</p>
<p>Tamaki smacked his  forehead, &quot;Would you both shut up! God, I don't know your guys'  deal, but this is MOMO and I's date. It isn't your part to butt in,  chick!&quot;</p>
<p>Sae smirked, nodding  quietly. She walked past me to leave and whispered, &quot;You'll  regret this, Momo.&quot;</p>
<p>I sank to my knees. Last  year was hell for me. I couldn't do it again. No, I couldn't.</p>
<p>&quot;You all right,  Momo?&quot;</p>
<p>Without responding, I  thought about how school was in a week. Damn it... Why?</p>
<p>&quot;Momo?&quot;</p>
<p>I didn't hear him at all.  I was in thought. I wanted to cry, thinking about everything that  happened.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo!!&quot; he  shook me.</p>
<p>I snapped out of my  thoughts once more, and stared up at him. &quot;...What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sit down... I'll  explain it to you,&quot; I said, taking a seat.</p>
<p>After several hours of  going over everything that happened in the past, I silenced myself.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow... That's...  horrible.&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded, still silent.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I know why you  hate her,&quot; he said, staring at me.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah... but  stupidly, I always come to her rescue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're a good  person, whether you hate the person or not.&quot; He smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you...&quot;</p>
<p>He grabbed my chin, and  pressed his lips to mine. In shock, my face faded from a sun-tanned  orange to a pale white.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll never let you  hurt again. I promise.&quot;</p>
<p>I blushed gently, holding  back tears. He's so good to me...</p>
<p>I realized it was past  eight. I'm never supposed to be out this late. &quot;Listen... I'm  not supposed to be out this late. I had a nice time with you. But I  need to get home...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Want me to take you  home? You shouldn't ride the train this late by yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's okay, I'll take  myself home...&quot; I stared down.</p>
<p>He raised my chin. &quot;No,  you won't. I'm taking you home.&quot; He pulled me to the nearest  train stop and we boarded it.</p>
<p>After a silent ride home,  he walked me to my house.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you for taking  me home...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's okay. No need  to thank me.&quot; He smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I really like you,  Momo. I'd like to do this again.&quot; He pulled out a piece of paper  and handed it to me. &quot;That's my number. Call me whenever you  need me, okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right... Thank  you,&quot; I paused, slipping the paper into my pocket. &quot;I  really like you, too.&quot;</p>
<p>He grinned. &quot;Good  night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; 'Night.&quot;</p>
<p>I walked into my home, and  surprisingly, my mom didn't sweat me on where I had been all day. I  went up to my room. &quot;Good night, mom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good night!&quot;</p>
<p>I brushed my teeth and  undressed, getting into the bathtub. After a good hour of washing and  relaxing, I got out and got into my pajamas. If anyone deserved a  good night sleep, it was me. I lay down, and soon fell into a  relaxing, deep sleep.</p>
