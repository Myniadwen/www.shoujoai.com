<p>I jumped out of bed when I noticed Haruhi was naked, too. Staring at  the alarm clock, then back to Haruhi, and once again to the clock, I  realized it was quite early. 4:08AM.</p>
<p>I grabbed my clothes and  shoved them into Haruhi's washer, setting it to the 'small' setting. In  an hour, my clothes should be washed. Haruhi was still knocked out. I  was glad I didn't wake her. But, still, what happened last night? I  couldn't remember much.</p>
<p>I sat on Haruhi's couch once again. I  wrapped a blanket around my naked budy, unsure of what I should do  next. So I stared. And thought. Thought very hard about what happened.  I could only recall what happened before my clothes were torn off. I  sighed.</p>
<p>An hour passed, and the washer went off. From the living  room, I heard Haruhi move around and moan in her sleep, but she  eventually fell silent. I took it that she was back to sleeping  soundly. I loaded my uniform into her dryer, and set it to 100 minutes.  School would be starting in three hours.</p>
<p>In the mean time, while  I waited for my clothes to dry, I fell asleep on the couch. I dreamed  about what happened the previous night, the hot moments, her calling my  name in my ear, kissing me, treading the kisses all over my body.</p>
<p>I awoke to the dryer's alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi there, love!&quot; Haruhi smothered my lips with a passionate good morning kiss. I didn't even see her there!</p>
<p>&quot;Uh.. hello there, Haru-chan...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  making bacon and eggs, American-style. You'll love it!&quot; I noticed  Haruhi was in an apron. When she walked into the kitchen, I saw her  bare bottoms. There was absolutely nothing underneath her apron... not  even underwear or a bra. I bit my lip.</p>
<p>&quot;So, you can make American cuisine?&quot; I said, my eyes staring up as my face reddened with blush. I was so nervous!</p>
<p>&quot;Yup!  I lived in America for a year. My dad was in the army over there and  had returned to home base. My mom is really the only Japanese parent I  have. So, I'm half Japanese, half American. While we were over there, I  picked up some English. I'm not really fluent, but I know enough to  talk like I am!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, Haru-chan...&quot; As I was biting my lip, I  realized that Haruhi used present tense when referring to her mom. Did  the doctor lie? &quot;Hey, Haruhi... did something happen to your parents...  Say, a car crash?&quot; I stared at her face intently.</p>
<p>She was silent for a moment, but never hesitated. &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  okay... then, where are your parents?&quot; I averted my eyes, glancing down  at my lap. I had just realized that I was still naked around Haruhi. I  grasped the covers around me, covering myself completely.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't  worry about it!&quot; Haruhi jumped over to me, sat in my lap, facing me.  She planted her lips against mine like she had last night. I was  instantly in a trance.</p>
<p>I kissed her back immediately, throwing  her onto the couch and getting on top of her. Like a man, I grinded  myself against her, kissing her neck with soft, luscious kisses. I  nibbled it gently. I could no longer hold myself back.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo.. Momo.. the eggs are burning...&quot; Haruhi managed to say in a sexual tone.</p>
<p>&quot;Let  them burn.&quot; I grinded her harder and harder, until I heard her  screaming my name at the top of her lungs. My hands instantly groped  her breasts. I didn't know what was wrong with me, but it was like  something was awakened inside of me.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo.. Momo...! Oh!&quot; Haruhi was breathing heavily. Her hands grabbed my ass, and I smiled.</p>
<p>Stopping all of a sudden, I lifted Haruhi up onto her feet. &quot;Turn around.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O-okay,  Momo-chan...&quot; She did as such, and I untied her apron slowly. I threw  it to the side, threw her back around, and backed her into the wall.  She felt me against her, and I propped her up. Her legs were around my  waist. My smile grew wider.</p>
<p>I repeated my grinding over and over,  and she kept screaming. I took her into the kitchen, sat her on the  counter, and started kissing her all over again. My lips eventually  traveled to her breasts, but I did not hesitate to kiss those all over.  When I nibbled them, I'd hear her pant with lust and emotion and scream  my name and tell me she loved me.</p>
<p>Eventually, she released her wet warmth.</p>
<p>And that's when everything was done.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo-chan... I didn't... know you felt that way towards me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't know, either.&quot;</p>
<p>Haruhi  blushed, crossing her legs uncomfortably. I guessed that she was still  as turned on as I was. She hopped off the counter and turned the stove  off, emptying the burned up eggs into a trash can under the sink. She  sat the skillet in the sink and ran water into it, then turned to me.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Haru-chan?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  can't take it anymore.&quot; She shoved me down onto the floor, taking over.  Moments like these lasted a long time. I still remember her soft,  striking voice telling me she loved me.</p>
<p>When we made our final  finish, I realized that it was already past time for school. In fact,  it was too late to show up. I knew rumors would fly.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Momo?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, Haruhi-chan?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will you live with me?&quot;</p>
