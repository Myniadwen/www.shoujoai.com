<p>When I came home from  the market, the house was quiet. &quot;Momo?&quot; I dropped the  groceries at the front door, then searched all of the rooms. No one  was in the house!</p>
<p>I ran outside,  desperately watching out, searching every face, trying to find Momo.  But she was no where to be find. So I searched the whole town. I  looked every single place she liked to go, but everyone said they  hadn't seen her since school ended.</p>
<p>So when I returned  home, I called up Momo's mom. She said she hadn't seen her daughter  in ages. I called the yakuza folks, but they said when she went to  school the other day, she never came home.</p>
<p>That's right. She was  with me. The entire night. In that storage room.</p>
<p>I rested on the couch  that Momo loved so much after calling everyone that Momo knew.</p>
<p>As far as everyone  knew, she had just disappeared. &quot;This... is bad.&quot;</p>
<p>That night, I fell  asleep troubledly, alone and miserable without Momo's touch.</p>
<p>Morning didn't come  quick enough. I decided to go search for her again, deciding that  maybe something had happened and she could've just stayed at the  karaoke place again. Maybe she was over a friend's house. Maybe Sae  lied, and Momo was really there.</p>
<p>I decided to go to  Sae's home that evening, after enjoying a delicious lunch at a  near-by restaurant.</p>
<p>I took my time there,  figuring that if Momo was there, she didn't want to rush to see a  scene like the one at school. I knew Momo was cheating... and it hurt  so badly.</p>
<p>When I arrived, I  hesitated to knock, but eventually mustered up the courage to do so.  Sae answered quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey... what are  you doing here, huh?&quot; She seemed exhausted. She was even half  naked, wearing nothing but a thin towel around her body. Her hair was  wet.</p>
<p>I thought, <em>Well,  maybe they decided to take a shower together. </em>&quot;I  was looking for Momo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, come in.  I'll... fix you something, Kotobuki.&quot; Sae motioned for me to  step inside her house, so I did, and then she pointed to the couch.  &quot;Sit down.&quot;</p>
<p>I sat down, realizing  her house was quite fancy. I took in the view: chandeliers, suede  couches, big screen television in the living room. &quot;Wow, nice  place.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks. I work  hard for it.&quot;</p>
<p>I noticed her trying to  reach for some clothes on a shelf, so I stood up and walked over to  her. I reached to get the clothes, but stumbled and fell on Sae, who  also slipped. I landed atop her.</p>
<p>Sae blinked at me, her  face red with blush as she motioned down to her towel. It wasn't  covering her breasts anymore.</p>
<p>I quickly stood up once  more, whistling as if nothing had happened. But when Sae returned to  standing, she took off her towel right in front of me.</p>
<p>I walked over to her  and covered her chest, trying not to peek at them. &quot;Keep those  apples covered!&quot;</p>
<p>But Sae let out a moan,  falling onto the floor, with me tumbling over onto her.</p>
<p>She stripped me naked,  down to nothing, without even a necklace or hair tie. I sat there,  staring up at her, noticing how full her breasts were.</p>
<p>Only, she didn't just  stare. She immediately began doing to me as what she did to Momo.</p>
<p>Except the fact that at  home, Sae had many more toys. Vibrators, dildos, you name it and she  used them on me.</p>
<p>She dominated me the  whole time, and I had no complaints. The sex felt good with her,  everything felt loving and pleasureful, with Sae going in me.</p>
<p>She didn't even bother  starting with kisses--she got right down to business, moving over my  breasts and nibbling and biting them, teasing them with flicks and  sucking on them. When she felt I had enough of that, her mouth went  even lower, eating me until I screamed &quot;I love you&quot; and  gave up about holding back.</p>
<p>We continued for hours  and hours. The pain, the pleasure, the love, the romance, Sae and me.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh... I love  you.. Oh, Momo...&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, everything  stopped as the words slipped from my mouth, but Sae didn't let it  phase her too much.</p>
<p>She decided to give me  cruel love, locking with up with furry handcuffs and blind-folding me  like some pornography movie. She also cuffed me legs to each side of  the bed, them spread apart permanently.</p>
<p>She squeezed my breasts  tentively and made her tongue go deep, never stopping to give me a  break. By now, the only thing I was screaming was Momo's name.</p>
<p>But Sae ignored it.</p>
<p>Everytime I called out  Momo's name, Sae brought out more tools, more fun things, did more to  me than any had ever done.</p>
<p>She'd stuck vibrators  in me, whipped me, even slapped me sometimes.</p>
<p>But it never ended. The  night went on, my calls got louder and louder, and Sae never gave up.</p>
<p>She just made me hers  the whole time.</p>
