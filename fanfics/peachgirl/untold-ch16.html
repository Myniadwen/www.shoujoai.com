<p>When I woke up, I was  in a room. Boxes were everywhere. My school uniform was nicely folded  and laying on one of the boxes. I stood up, and gasped. Even my bra  was there! &quot;Those perverts...!&quot; I gritted my teeth as I  dressed, did my hair, brushed my teeth, and went to the main room of  the yakuza headquarters.</p>
<p>A delicious buffet was  laid out for everyone to see, and my seat was right across the boss,  seemingly the second most important seat at the table. The guys were  stuffing their food down their throat while I just sat there,  nervously and neatly eating my breakfast.</p>
<p>&quot;Uhm... thank  you,&quot; I managed to say.</p>
<p>They all nodded and  smiled at me, and I shrunk down in my seat.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just too  crazy,&quot; I whispered to myself.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry,  you'll get used to it,&quot; said a boy of about nineteen years.</p>
<p>I sat up and stared at  him, wondering who else heard what I said. I looked over the boy, and  came to a conclusion he was the youngest member. Well, besides me.  &quot;Can I go to school now? I'll be late.&quot;</p>
<p>All of the guys stood  up at once, rushing over to me, standing me up, then softly and  carefully dragged me out of the house. Once we were outside, they  hoisted me up once more and took me to school.</p>
<p>I squirmed up there,  but no one put me down and I eventually gave in. Once we arrived, all  eyes were on my. Including Haruhi's and Sae's. I avoided both of  their eyes as I was taken to homeroom by the members. They left once  a teacher asked them to, and everyone was asking me just what the  hell was going on.</p>
<p>I answered honestly. &quot;I  have no idea.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone gave me weird  looks, but I ignored them and looked down at my assignment, focusing  on my work and soon completing it.</p>
<p>During my class break,  it seemed Haruhi was going to ask me where I was, so I made up an  excuse and went to the bathroom. In the bathroom, short, black-haired  Sae was there, awaiting me. I rushed out of the bathroom and came  back to class.</p>
<p>Haruhi tossed me a  note, but I pretended not to see it and &quot;accidentally&quot;  shoved it onto the floor. I just couldn't speak to neither of them.</p>
<p>When lunch approached,  I left the room and ate in a storage closet. I was finally away from  all distractions, alone, with no drama, no craziness, no girls. I  skipped my last classes and was going to leave on my own, but Haruhi  finally caught me while I had no excuses.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, hey, Haruhi,  haven't talked to you all day! Sorry, things have just been spacey  for me. I wasn't really paying much attention and--&quot;</p>
<p>She slapped me across  the face, giving me a hurtful expression. &quot;Stop lying to me,  Momo. What is going on? I saw you this morning, with those weird guys  and their haircuts.&quot;</p>
<p>I rubbed my cheek,  looking away and shaking my head. &quot;I don't know! I truly  don't...&quot; I stared her in the eyes, adding, &quot;I was at a  karaoke joint and woke up with them calling me a yakuza princess!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.&quot; Her  face melted into a mix of anxiety and worrisome, and she touched my  cheek. &quot;I'm sorry. For hitting you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's all right.  Don't worry about me--I'm fine!&quot; I gave her a reassuring smile.  &quot;But--oh! I forgot my bag inside. I'll be right back.&quot;</p>
<p>I ran back inside, up  the stairs, up into the empty classroom, and grabbed my bags. Then I  felt someone hug me from behind, their hands traveling up my skirt  and violating my area. They caressed me softly, and I turned around  to see who it was.</p>
<p>It was Sae.</p>
<p>She turned me around,  sexually dragging me into a corner of the room, her hands still  touching places that shouldn't even be mentioned.</p>
<p>It was after school. No  one was there. No one but me and her. I left out pleasurable moans as  her hands played between my legs, slipping under my panties.</p>
<p>Her lips were all over  my neck, her other hand making its way up my shirt and into my bra.  She started to grind me and my face was turning a soft red, sweat  rolling down my cheeks.</p>
<p>She began pulling off  my skirt, just as Haruhi walked in and nearly tripped over a desk,  discovering us in a corner, grinding, undressing, moaning, touching.  She didn't even scream or say anything, just gawked and turned to  run.</p>
<p>Sae didn't stop, she  only forced me down harder and touched me more passionately, her hand  going in farther and farther. I eventually chased after Haruhi when I  slipped away from Sae, my skirt off and my shirt half up.</p>
<p>I found her crying in  the same place I ate lunch--the storage room. She shoved me onto the  ground and started to painlessly hit me, none of the hits intended to  actually hurt me.</p>
<p>&quot;Why?! Why, Momo?!  Why did you get with her?! Why not me? She hurt you! She did horrible  things! It's not fair!&quot; Her hits slowly ceased, and she cried on  my chest.</p>
<p>&quot;Haruhi, I'm so..  sorry... I didn't mean to... but...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is she the reason  you never came home? Were you fucking her? Were you?&quot; she  screamed at me, hitting me again.</p>
<p>&quot;She forced me,  Haruhi! Really! She wouldn't let me go, and I couldn't just tell you!  I was scared you'd hate me! And then these guys made me live with  them, and...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I want no  excuses! If you love me, then...&quot; She started to remove the rest  of my clothes, my bra and panties gone, and started loving me harder  than Sae did, right there in the storage room.</p>
<p>I screamed out my moans  louder than ever before, her name naturally leaving my lips. I  grabbed her ass, squeezing it tightly and gave her all the love my  heart could ever hold.</p>
<p>Her moans were even  louder than mine.</p>
<p>We spent the whole  night together, right there in the storage room with all of the mops,  desks, and equipment watching us.</p>
<p>Rumors sparked the very  next morning.</p>
