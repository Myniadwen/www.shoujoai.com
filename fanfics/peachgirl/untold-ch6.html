<p>The very next day,  right after the date, I received news. Terrible news. I couldn't  believe it.</p>
<p>He was moving away.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you serious?  Where are you moving to? Why?&quot; I asked. I was talking to him  over the phone.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I know. My  dad suddenly got redirected to the U.S.,&quot; Tamaki told me. His  tone was unhappy, as if he regretted it. I only wondered why these  things always happened to me...</p>
<p>&quot;Well... will I  ever see you again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If he gets  redirected back to Japan... yeah, you will. But I don't even know  when that will be,&quot; he said in a hushed tone.</p>
<p>&quot;What does he do?&quot;  I asked. I could at least get an idea from his job.</p>
<p>&quot;He works in the  army.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I see... Is  he going to Iraq?&quot; I started to sort of feel bad for him.</p>
<p>&quot;Probably, but he  won't be fighting,&quot; he said. But for some reason, it seemed like  a pause.</p>
<p>&quot;... Something  wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen, Momo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;.. Yeah?&quot;  What could it be?</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think  I'll be back for a long time. I'm sorry, okay? Don't... Just keep  your head up, alright?&quot;</p>
<p>I was silent.</p>
<p>&quot;.. I guess this  is goodbye. Sorry, Momo.&quot;</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>I sighed. It hurted a  little, and I didn't want him to go. I buried my face into a pile of  pink pillows, screaming into them. No one heard me, and I was glad.  But it didn't take the pain away. &quot;You idiot!&quot;</p>
<p>I sighed again. I  grabbed a few clothings--just a blue jean skirt paired with a pink  tank top--and walked into the bathroom.</p>
<p>Thirty or so minutes  later, I walked out again. I grabbed my purse and headed downstairs.  Walking out the house as I waved to my mother, I began going down the  street. I passed the dog that never failed to bark. &quot;I guess I  should go shopping, 'cause school is next week.&quot; I continued  walking until I met the store, the one where Sae had criticised my  taste in purses.</p>
<p>I picked up a bag that  was on sale. After checking my purse for money, I had went to the  clerk. I gave her the money needed to purchase it; I took back what  wasn't needed. I smiled to the lady and walked off.</p>
<p>I made my way to a  grocery store. Mom had specifically wanted me to pick up some octopus  balls and watermelon. I did what was necessary to buy the food and  came home.</p>
<p>&quot;Mom, I'm home. I  bought your groceries, okay ?They're on the table!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks, Mo',&quot;  my mother replied.</p>
<p>I made my way back  upstairs. Instead of thinking about Tamaki, I found myself thinking  about, none-other, Kairi. He was like some computer virus, programmed  to always be in my mind.</p>
<p><em>First Day of School</em></p>
<p>I looked up at the  large school building. I heavily sighed, wondering what Sae would  pull. Then, I made my way into the school, removing my outdoor shoes  and putting on the indoor slippers. I walked straight to my locker to  get ready for class.</p>
<p>Over the P.A. system,  an announcement was made. We were going to have an introductory  assembly. I was a second year now, so I wouldn't be attending.</p>
<p>Walking to homeroom, I  had suddenly tripped. I wasn't sure <em>what</em> had happened, so I looked up.</p>
<p>Who was staring up at  me? I was guessing you knew! It was, of course, Sae.</p>
<p>Sae Kashiwagi, the girl  who never failed to make my every day's existence at school an  earth's chamber of hell!</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, hello, Momo.  Sorry. I didn't see you there,&quot; she said with a smirk that only  I saw. It quickly changed to an innocent look of despair, which would  fool every one into thinking she was honestly sorry!</p>
<p>I narrowed my eyes. I  stood up and nodded, &quot;No worries, Sae. It's okay.&quot;</p>
<p>She proceeded to bow.</p>
<p>I made my way to class.  I could only wonder what Sae would do next, because I <em>knew</em> that's not all she had. I was staring out of the window, not paying  much attention because I was imagining all the bad things.</p>
<p>How about my desk being  thrown out the window? No, Sae was more conniving and way more  sneakier than that. If foxes became extinct, she'd be the next best  thing. Would she trash my locker or mess with my test scores? I  doubted that for some reason, she just seemed like she'd do something  that'd hurt me long-term and not something that would only hurt me  for a moment. I really didn't know <em>what</em> she'd do.</p>
<p>I felt something bounce  off the back of my head. I blinked. Turning around and looking down,  I saw a paper ball. I picked it up, and opened it. I read the words  to myself.</p>
<p><em>I told you not to  mess with me, Momo. You're going to get it now...</em></p>
<p>What... was she going  to do?!</p>
