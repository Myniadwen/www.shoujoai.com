<p>I was gone before Sae  even had a chance to wake up. I knew something was wrong with me now.  I had sex with Sae! Of all people! The person who has always tried to  make me miserable! What on earth was wrong with me? I don't even  understand anymore.</p>
<p>I didn't go home to  Haruhi, either. I ended up going to a karaoke place, and using a room  there to spend the rest of the night at. I couldn't go home, or  living with Haruhi would be all over. But I couldn't face Haruhi,  either. Sure, we weren't technically dating, but...</p>
<p>I shifted my spot on  the booth in the room. &quot;Well, I'm here. I might as well sing.&quot;  I leapt up and grabbed the book of songs, searching through them  until I found Konayuki by Remioromen. Once I heard the song, I  instinctively sang out the lyrics at the top of my lungs, ridding  myself of these horrible anxieties.</p>
<p>&quot;Season of snow  powder always come.</p>
<p>Although we are mixed up  with a mass of people,</p>
<p>we are looking on the same  sky</p>
<p>Blown by the wind, and we  are chilled by it.&quot;</p>
<p>Once the song ended, my  lungs were exhausted, so I fell asleep on the booth.</p>
<p>I awoke to curious  people, staring me in the eyes and prodding my sides rudely.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! She's  awake!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, it's that  girl. She's been asleep for a while, though she knocked out 'er  somethin'.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yo, boss, da  girl's up. Wha' should we do's?&quot;</p>
<p>I sat up promptly,  staring around at them all. I scooted away from them all, jumping up  and dashing for the door, but discovered it was locked.</p>
<p>&quot; 'Ey, girly,  we're not interested in hurtin' yas, so relax,&quot; a tall guy in a  black suit with dark, tanned skin and a funny, choppy haircut told  me.</p>
<p>&quot;Uhm, hi. What's  going on? This is my room and--&quot; Cut off.</p>
<p>&quot;Girly, we rented  dis room out yesterdays. You probably wandered in heres by accident,&quot;  said another one of the guys, except he wore a different suit and had  spiked, dyed-blond hair.</p>
<p>And then the boss  stepped up to me. He grabbed my arm and inspected me, even looking up  my skirt once before dropping me. &quot;She's good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good with what?!&quot;  I screamed out, fixing my skirt and dusting off my arm as I caught my  balance.</p>
<p>&quot;Girly--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My name is Momo!  Now stop calling me that!&quot; I stared around the small room,  decorated in a maroon color with green furniture.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo. Okays,  girly. I mean, Momo. We needs a girl to be our yakuza princess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A <em>what</em>?!  Yakuza princess?!&quot; My eyes widened so much that I was sure  they'd pop out my eye sockets. This was just too much. First Haruhi,  then Sae and Kairi, then me and Sae, what was next? Oh, look, people  scouting you to be a yakuza princess!</p>
<p>&quot;Non-negotiable.  So just say yes nicely or we'll have to force you.&quot; The boss  flashed me a sly smile, then turned around. &quot;Get the girl.&quot;</p>
<p>All fourteen or so of  the guys grabbed me and hoisted me up onto their shoulders, shuffling  out of the room as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;Contact her  parents,&quot; the boss ordered his followers once we were at their  home base.</p>
<p>&quot;Mom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, contact her  mom. Girly--I mean, Momo's--got an attitude. It's kinda' cute.  Perfect for da yakuza princess.&quot;</p>
<p>They interrogated me  about where I lived and my phone number, but eventually they got it  out of me. They made a very good excuse to my mom why they needed me  to be there, but I never quite heard it. I just know my mom agreed  happily.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not cool.  I still go to school, right? I have school tomorrow!&quot; I asked,  feeling a bit annoyed. I was now sitting on the floor of the room,  with tons of guys sitting around me paying every single bit of  attention to me.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, Momo.  Don't'cha worry, you get express order.&quot; The guy flashed me a  smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Express <em>what</em>?&quot;  I didn't get anything they said, like their metaphors were a foreign  language.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't'cha worry.  You see tomorrow, ya hear?&quot;</p>
<p>I turned away from him,  only to see more faces. I groaned. I wasn't really liking this, it  was just all too weird! Regardless, that night, I didn't sleep a  wink. Sleep just wouldn't come.</p>
