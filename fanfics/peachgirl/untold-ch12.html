<p>I sat in class, spacier  than usual. Staring out the window, taking in the gray clouds, I  realized that it was probably going to rain today.</p>
<p>Rain. I hate the rain.  But we need it.</p>
<p>&quot;Adachi Momo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot; As I  heard my name, reality was shaken into me. I lazily stared over to my  teacher, and took in his features, too.</p>
<p>He had gray hair, very  small and slanted eyes, a slight beard, and his head was starting to  bald. He wasn't exactly fit, but he wasn't fat, either. He wore an  khaki suit and a checkered tie. His white shirt was collared and his  black, classic shoes were reflection-can-be-seen clean.</p>
<p>&quot;I suggest you pay  more attention in class,&quot; he scolded me. He then turned his  back, and, like in middle school, wrote my name under a warning list.  &quot;I hope I don't have to warn you again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Sensei.&quot;  Glancing down at my books, I noticed a folded up piece of paper. It  read:</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Momo. It's me,  Sae. Yeah. I was sick yesterday. I'm sorry I haven't hung out with  you in a while! I'm also behind in math. Can you tutor me after  school?&quot;</p>
<p>I scoffed at the note  out loud, and people turned their eyes towards me. I shook my head  and pretended to be coughing or choking on something. Their glares,  one by one, went away.</p>
<p>I grabbed a pen and  wrote, &quot;Hello no,&quot; but quickly scribbled it out to where it  looked like a blob of black ink. Then I thought for a second, glanced  at Haruhi, and sighed. &quot;I'll be over there an hour after  school.&quot; I tossed the note to Sae's desk.</p>
<p>When she read it, she  smiled at me sweetly. <em>I wonder what she's up  to...</em></p>
<p>When school finally  ended, I checked up at home.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo? Is that  you? Where have you been? You never came home last night!&quot; My  mom came out of the kitchen, and stared at me with a worried  expression.</p>
<p>As I was slipping off  my shoes and slipping on my house slippers, I explained to my mom  everything that happened. Well, not everything. I left out all the  crazy things me and Haruhi did, but did tell her about how she was  attacked and had no one at home to take care of her.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, dear! Momo!  Why didn't you just call and say so? I'm sure she's all alone at home  right now! You can stay there and take care of her until she's all  right, okay? Mom will be fine at home.&quot; She smiled to her  daughter, then walked back into the kitchen.</p>
<p>I plopped down onto the  couch and sighed. &quot;Mom, I'll be going over her house in a little  bit. I have to get dressed first, though. I'm glad today's a Friday.  Won't have to worry about school tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>I wandered upstairs and  looked through my clothes, grabbing a jean skirt, a lacy light blue  top, and some matching leggings. Slipping on them all and pulling my  hair into a sleek, high ponytail with hair falling onto my face on  the side, I glanced around my room. My eyes fell on dark blue  sandals. &quot;I'm glad it's spring, too...&quot;</p>
<p>I ran down my steps and  waved to my mom, and then left the house.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later, I  had arrived at Sae's house. I knocked on the door.</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&quot;That's weird...&quot;  The second time I knocked, the door slightly opened on its own. &quot;I  guess it's open...&quot;</p>
<p>Walking in, it was  completely dark. I checked out every room--the dining room, kitchen,  parents' bedroom, bathroom--and then I saw stairs. I climbed the  stairs and eventually came to a door. When I opened to door, I saw  another bedroom. Staring to the right, I glanced over a TV. My eyes  swept the room until I saw the bed.</p>
<p>On the bed was Sae.</p>
<p>And Kairi.</p>
<p>Kairi only had boxers  on, while Sae only had a pair of underwear. Their hair was crazy, and  on the floor I saw Sae's school uniform and her bra.</p>
<p>I backed out of the  room, quickly running down the stairs and tripping on one of the last  ones. I fell face-first onto the floor. I picked myself back up,  dashed for the door, when a muscular hand caught my arm and slammed  me onto the ground. I heard the door lock.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo...!&quot; I  saw Kairi rushing down the stairs, staring confusedly at me. I could  instantly read his expression: 'Why was Momo on the ground?'</p>
<p>Sae took her time down  the stairs, with an innocent smile plastered upon her face. &quot;I  see you've finally arrived. Sorry Momo, but you need to learn your  place.&quot; She stared at the guy that had slammed Momo, and then  looked back down at her. &quot;You little lesbian.&quot;</p>
<p>My eyes widened as the  guy started to slide off my jean skirt. &quot;Sae, what's going on?!&quot;  I squirmed away from him and almost got on my feet, but he slammed me  down again.</p>
<p>&quot;Sae! What the  hell is going on?&quot; Kairi protested, but Sae's glare shut him up.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo, all this  time... even when you were dating Kairi, he was seeing me. You  understand? I had him backstab you. I made him <em>pretend</em> to love you.&quot; Sae crossed her arms across her bare chest. She  motioned for Kairi to come over to her, and she cocked her head. It  revealed her neck.</p>
<p>Kairi started to kiss  her neck with a passion Momo hadn't seen before this. At least, not  in Kairi.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm also the  cause of Haruhi getting beaten.&quot; Sae's smile widened.</p>
<p>My eyes never left the  scene, even as the stranger slid off my panties to sexually and  mentally torture me.</p>
<p>When I was finally  released from the house, I was in shock. I walked in a daze towards  Haruhi's house. When I finally got there, out of instinct, I went to  floor three and found Haruhi's room. I had already had a key, since  Haruhi had suggested I keep one until my decision. Stepping into the  apartment, I wandered over to the couch and collapsed on it.</p>
<p>When Haruhi found me,  she dropped her grocery bags and fell to my side, shaking me to wake  up. And when I finally did wake up, I said not one word. All I did  was stand up, led Haruhi to her bed room, undressed her, and let  things happen from there.</p>
<p>I wondered if all the  times Haruhi had called out my name could heal me.</p>
<p>Regardless, I had never  grinded her so good as I had that night...</p>
<p>I fell asleep naked and  exhausted from tearing Haruhi down so good.</p>
