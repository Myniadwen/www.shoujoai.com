<p>Quickly, I balled up the paper I had found. I was startled;  confused; upset; worried. What would Sae do? What did she mean, &quot;You're  going to get it now?&quot; When I looked up, my mathematics teacher was  staring at me. He began walking down the isle towards me, and then  stopped in front of me.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo, what is in your hand?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uhm... oh, sorry, Sensei. I was passing notes. I won't do it again.&quot;</p>
<p>The entire class laughed at my honesty.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Momo, if it does indeed happen again, you'll have third period detention. Got it?&quot;</p>
<p>Third period was swimming for me, one of my favorite things to do. &quot;Yes, Sensei.&quot;</p>
<p>The  teacher walked back to the front of the room, scribbled with a piece of  chalk on the board, and proceeded to teach the class about a more  advanced type of algebra.</p>
<p>I was spacing out, so when our test came that Friday, I failed. Failed miserably... even though I was sure I had it down!</p>
<p>&quot;Momo,  what has happened? Your grades have dropped so quickly, so much.&quot; And I  knew that voice from anywhere. If you even needed me to introduce her,  her name is Sae. Sae Kashiwagi. Ever since we met as freshmen, first  years, of high school, we have been inseparable in such a twisted way  that it disgusts me. She loves to torture me, she loves to steal what's  mine, and even after that, she's still not satisfied!</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, Sae. Is there something you need?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, but your bag! It looks horrible with your school uniform!&quot; Sae claimed, with the most weird laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,  Sae. See you later.&quot; Suddenly, her words didn't phase me. I'd become  used to it, and I was too busy for the crap she tried to pull last  year. I walked towards my locker, which, once again, was next to Sae's.</p>
<p>Sae scowled underneath her proud tone and followed Momo. &quot;But, Momo! Do you really want to be laughed at again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't care.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Momo!  Really, you're such a shy one... Was losing Tamaki that bad for you?  You poor, precious thing.&quot; Sae smiled at me, and then I was sure I knew  what happened.</p>
<p>&quot;What influence do you have over the army?! Huh?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What  on Earth do you mean, Momo? I am confused; I have no idea what you are  talking about! Sheesh, try making some sense,&quot; Sae said with absolutely  no hesitation.</p>
<p>I grabbed my books from my locker and put my  outdoor shoes in there, locked it up tightly, and started to quickly  walk away from Sae.</p>
<p>Sae was feeling persistent, and so, she  continued to follow me. &quot;Mo, you really should move on. I mean, with  the whole Touji and Kairi thing... You sure have bad taste in guys!&quot;</p>
<p>Kairi  was lurking from the corner, spying on us, and I had caught a glimpse  of him furring his eyebrows in disgust at Sae. When our eyes met, he  quickly disappeared from the corner in hopes that I didn't see him.</p>
<p>I  sighed. &quot;Sae, I don't have time for this. Get off my back and let me go  to class, okay? Thanks.&quot; I shoved past her and went into homeroom,  taking a seat at my desk. I readied myself for it, moving my notebooks  in place and bringing out a piece of paper to write on.</p>
<p>&quot;All right. Time for attendance. Adachi?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chidori?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm here!&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I  found myself spacing out more than usual, and it was unlike me. Was  there something wrong with me? Were my emotions taking a toll on my  life? I just couldn't decide. Sure, Tamaki was nice, but... Kairi... he  was.. indescribable.. And he turned my entire life around and made it  heaven. Why couldn't I just tell him that?</p>
<p>Oh.. yeah.. because,  he broke up with me. He never told me why, either. He said he was over  Misao... and Sae said she'd get me back... but did this mean that she  was going to try to take my man again?! No, it couldn't be. Remember?  Sae hates Kairi. She can't go near him; he's like mosquito repellent to  her.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo! Get your head out of the clouds and pay attention!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh? Oh, sorry...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've been acting really weird, Momo. What's up with you?&quot; my teacher asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Must be her period,&quot; I heard a boy say. I wasn't sure who it was.</p>
<p>&quot;Regardless, as I need to go on, I'll introduce our new student.&quot;</p>
<p>New student? Wait, since when? I need to pay attention!</p>
<p>&quot;Her name is--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My name is Haruhi! Haruhi Kotobuki. I hope we all get along this year, okay? Okay!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Erm... why don't you start by telling us a little about yourself? Say, hobbies?&quot; our teacher questioned her.</p>
<p>I  knew her face from anywhere. I thought long and hard, and after she  mentioned that like any normal girl, she loved to shop, I realized that  she was the girl that I shopped with for my date.</p>
<p>&quot;I know her  now!!&quot; I threw into the air with an embarrassing yell that I meant to  trap inside of my mind. I didn't mean to yell it!</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, hey! It's  Momo! You go here? Well, cool! Then, can I sit next to Momo-chan?&quot;  Haruhi went on, interrupting her own stories for a new topic.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. Momo, why don't you show Kotobuki around the school? Be her guide,&quot; my teacher asked.</p>
<p>I  stood and bowed in an apology to the class for bursting out like that,  my face more red than a tomato. And then I nodded to the teacher,  motioned for Haru to sit next to me, and stared forward.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, whatever happened to your date, huh?&quot; Haruhi whispered to me.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.. his father had to move; he got redirected to America.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's sad!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,  I know,&quot; I responded, and we fell quiet. I paid attention to the front  of the class and wrote down the notes I missed. I'd ask someone in  class for their notes so that I could copy what I missed.</p>
<p>When  first period/homeroom had ended, Haruhi clung to my arm and I dragged  her off to second period. And when lunch finally came, we ended up  eating together. At first it felt weird, but I grew to like this. I  spent my next few weeks happy, with a new best friend keeping all bad  things off of my mind... That is, until Sae's scheme was put into  action.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that Sae was a bad person, but Haruhi  didn't even know her. I had even forgotten to warn Haruhi about her,  and so, when Sae decided to bully her, she was lost and confused.</p>
<p>&quot;Haruhi's a whore! She already tried to steal my man and my life!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sensei, please! Help me! Haru-chan is picking on me! She keeps shoving me into lockers... and pushing me around...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody! Haruhi! She just.. she just ruined my uniform!&quot;</p>
<p>It  looked like Sae had found new tricks. I never remembered her doing  these type of things. I knew this because Haruhi came crying to me. Sae  had tried to mop her up and shove her into a toilet. Maybe... Sae was  bullying me through hurting my new friend? It seemed just like her to  do that.</p>
<p>But it was all right. I'd figure out a way to save  Haruhi. I'd save her if it was the last thing I'd do... because when I  was hurt, I desperately wanted someone to save me. And she's my best  friend, so I owe it to her!</p>
