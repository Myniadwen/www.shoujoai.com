<p>After finding out she  was in the hospital, I told my mom I was going out and wouldn't be  back for a while. I rushed over to the hospital, where the doctors  made me stay in a waiting room.</p>
<p>&quot;Kotobuki was  found in an alley. We're not sure what happened, but we found marks  of a beating. She'll be all right, she's just asleep right now. We'll  let you know what's going to happen and when she wakes up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, thank you.&quot;  I smiled up to him, but suddenly had a question to ask. I crossed my  legs as I sat in the cold seat, still having my uniform on. &quot;Sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot; He  turned to me after he was starting to walk away.</p>
<p>&quot;What about her  parents? What happened to them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... It seems they  died last year. Car crash. The only number she had in her entire  house was yours, so we expected you to be someone very close to her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes... she's my  best friend. That means a lot to me.&quot; I sighed gently as he  walked off, but quickly heard my name being called.</p>
<p>Haruhi was limping  towards me, beat up and bent out of shape, but seemingly happy.  &quot;Momo! Momo! I'm so glad to see you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What happened?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, on my way  from work to home, these guys just walked up to me and... well... I  don't remember anything after that. I think they knocked me out  though.&quot; Haruhi giggled, although I couldn't see how this was  funny.</p>
<p>I stood up and ran to  her, hugging her like a true friend would. &quot;I'm so glad you're  safe!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm so glad you  came! Come on,&quot; she motioned to her room, &quot;let's go talk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right.&quot;  I followed her into her hospital room and sat down in a visitor  chair. We began talking about her experience and twenty minutes  later, Haruhi paused the conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah?&quot;</p>
<p>Haruhi leaned out of  her bed towards me, then stood up and wobbled over to me. I got up  and helped her back to her bed, but once I did that, she pressed her  lips against mine.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha-haruhi?!&quot;  My eyes widened, my face grew pale, and eventually, I just dropped my  jaw.</p>
<p>&quot;Momo-chan! I love  you!&quot; She did it again, this time wrapping her arms around my  shoulders and kissing me more deeply. I literally fell over, leaning  against Haruhi's bed, with Haruhi laying on top of me. She refused to  stop the kiss.</p>
<p>A nurse opened the  door, then dropped her clipboard, papers, and pen. Her eyes were that  of shock. &quot;I-I'm sorry!&quot; She picked up the things, rushed  out the room, and closed the door. Haruhi seemed to pay no attention.</p>
<p>Haruhi only clung more  to me, pressing her body against mine, kissing me deeper and deeper  until I felt a reaction. I returned her kiss passionately, and we  started making out, right there on the floor. Suddenly, Haruhi stood  up though, and smiled. &quot;Sorry. Do you want to come to my house?  I'm getting released today.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I told my mom I  wouldn't be home for a while, but...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;C'mon, Momo!  Please?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right...  sure. I don't mind.&quot;</p>
<p>A few hours later, we  were at her house. I sat on her couch again, my hands nervously  resting in my lap. Haruhi was in her room, apparently getting into  her pajamas, but I wasn't sure if I should believe that.</p>
<p>She walked out of her  bedroom, wearing nothing but her bra and undies.</p>
<p>My eyes widened, and,  like a reflex, I immediately turned around and stared at the wall.</p>
<p>&quot;It's okay,  Momo...&quot; I heard her footsteps behind me, knowing that she was  walking up behind me. She pressed her stomach against my back, her  arms gently resting on my shoulders. I shivered. She was very warm  and inviting, but I kept wondering to myself, 'Should I be doing  this?'</p>
<p>She guided me off the  couch, even slowly dragged me to her room, and threw me onto her bed.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha-haruhi...!&quot;  I shifted, rushing to the back of the bed, as far away from her as  possible, but she still made her way to me. Undressing me. Stripping  me down until I had the same amount of clothes on as her.</p>
<p>&quot;I want you,  Momo-chan...&quot; She wrapped her arms around me again, kissing my  lips and sliding her tongue into my mouth and massaging mine. Her  right hand slipped into my bra, massaging my left breast lovingly  until I couldn't help but moan into her mouth.</p>
<p>A smirk crossed her  lips, and she stopped kissing me. She treaded kisses down my neck,  between my chest, and on my stomach. She then made her way back up  slowly, tickling my skin with her tongue and getting up to my ears.  She called out my name in a whisper, told me things such as &quot;I  love you&quot; and &quot;I need you,&quot; and nibbled gently on my  earlobe.</p>
<p>The rest of the night  was a completely blur--I just remember waking up naked the next  morning with Haruhi on top of me, my clothes all over the floor, and  a quiet alarm clock next to me.</p>
<p>What had I done?</p>
