<h1>Sixteen Hours</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lunar/index.html">Lunar</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/takemenew.html">La Parka Girl/Take Me New</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Though it was a large-sized port town, for the most part Saith was 
barely considered a populated area. It had a few scattered groups of 
fishermen and lumberjacks, but all in all the only people that lived 
there were only considered with their immediate surroundings. The news 
and happenings of the mainland were of little to no interest to the 
humble people of Saith, and any gossip and rumors about the mainland&#146;s 
politicians were generally regarded as not worth the breath it took to 
speak them. It was a quiet village, and it was very slow paced. The 
perfect getaway for couples needing a relaxing break, and the only 
place for two souls in the public eye to get away to be together.

The sun was slowly setting into the ocean, and as it did so shades of 
orange and red were overcast on the sky. The beautiful scenery was a 
standard occurrence for the people of Saith, but for the hustling 
people of Meribia or Vane, it was a sight that they never had the 
chance to see. On a long, extended dock jutting out from the shore of 
Saith, two of these people sat, watching the sun as it slowly 
disappeared.

Both of their bodies were shrouded in dark robes of green, and though 
it was hard to tell for certain the gentle curves along each of their 
bodies hinted that they were female. From a distance they looked like 
two rocks jutting out from the wood of the deck, but open closer 
inspection it could be easily told that it was two lovers, hidden, 
holding one another while they quietly watched the sunset.

Jessica&#146;s left arm had stretched out across Mia&#146;s back, holding the 
smaller girl close to her form, her head facing out and her eyes 
focused on the slowly setting sun. Her other hand was down inside of 
her lap, resting atop Mia&#146;s, her thumb slowly coursing back and forth 
over the magic woman&#146;s frail, tender fingers. Both of their faces were 
shrouded in the hoods of the robes they both adorned, and even to one 
another their faces were covered in a thick, overlaid shadow. They 
both faced out, and watched the sun as it began its final few moments 
of life for that day.

&#147;It&#146;s beautiful.&#148; The smaller girl whispered, her gentle voice barely 
heard above the sound of the rustling waves. &#147;The sun...it&#146;s 
so...beautiful.&#148; The orange had disappeared in the sunset and had been 
replaced by purple, creating even more of a darkened hue as night 
slowly began to take over. Jessica nodded, her robes folding and 
bending to even the slightest motion she made.

&#147;...Yes.&#148; Her reply was just as low as Mia&#146;s, and every bit as sad. 
Her hand pressed down upon where Mia&#146;s lay in her lap, and she was 
forced to bite down a little on her lower lip, her canine fang gently 
pressing to her flesh. It was the same every month. The beautiful 
sunset, Mia&#146;s hand in her own, the gentle breeze as night began to 
chill the air. In her current life, they were the only nights she ever 
had to look forward to. She absently began to think of her situation, 
of Meribia, and of Kyle, but before her mind trailed too far off, 
Mia&#146;s voice brought her back to reality once more.

&#147;Jessie.&#148; Her tone was gentle, and as it was spoken Jessica could feel 
the touch of Mia&#146;s fingers, pressed gently into her cheek and urging 
her head to turn. She obediently followed the command and looked to 
Mia, who was looking up at her from behind the folds of her hood. Her 
upper face was shrouded yet in the shadows, and though her eyes were 
invisible to her, she could see two long, wet streaks, pressed against 
her cheek. Jessica let her cheek slip inside of Mia&#146;s palm, and she 
closed her eyes so she didn&#146;t have to see the magic girl cry. Mia 
simply sighed, and let her own eyes close as well, and before long she 
could feel moisture trailing across her hand where it laid upon 
Jessica&#146;s cheek. A single trail of liquid that coursed up and down 
along the ridges of her fingers, until it finally reached the end and 
made a mad rush for her wrist, before it fell onto a bundle of cloth 
in her lap. Mia kept her own eyes closed, for the same reason as 
Jessica, but she slowly began to draw her thumb back and forth, under 
Jessica&#146;s eye, collecting the tears as they ran and sending them on 
their way.

&#147;I hate...being mayor.&#148; Jessica&#146;s voice finally spoke, and as it did 
Mia could feel her hand grasping tight to her own. &#147;I hate being 
forced to run a town...I hate being with someone I don&#146;t love.&#148; Mia 
sighed, and continued to gently rub with her thumb. Jessica had 
prestige as the first female mayor of Meribia, but it had come at a 
high cost. A marriage to a man she considered sexist and egotistical, 
and a life of politics and loneliness, the type of which Jessica never 
wanted to fall into. Mia sighed, and her own voice began to speak it 
reply.

&#147;I know, Jessie...I know.&#148; Her tone was sweet, and with a hint of a 
comforting note. &#147;I hate being the head of the Magic Guild, but...it&#146;s 
who we are. We can&#146;t change our fate, Jessie...no matter how much we 
want to.&#148; Mia felt a lump rise high in her throat, but she did her 
best to swallow it back down. She was in a similar position as 
Jessica, though her own particular marriage was to someone who was 
more egotistical than he was sexist. For a second Mia thought of Nash, 
and her fingers grew a little tighter around Jessica&#146;s, where they 
both laid in the taller beast girl&#146;s lap. 

The town of Saith was the only place they could ever go to get away 
from the responsibilities, and their pain. It was the only town that 
didn&#146;t talk about them in hushed whispers, and the only town where 
rumors didn&#146;t exist. It would have been paradise for them, if they 
didn&#146;t both eventually have to return to their public lives.

&#147;Kyle is such a pig...&#148; Jessica spoke again, her voice was shaky, more 
so than Mia had ever heard it before. The stronger woman was never the 
type to show much emotion, but the love she had for Mia proved that it 
was at the very least possible. &#147;The things he expects me to do, I...&#148; 
Her words trailed off, and she pressed her cheek against Mia&#146;s hand a 
little bit tighter. Mia stayed quiet, and leaned into Jessica&#146;s form, 
her head resting upon the taller girl&#146;s shoulder.

They sat there together long after the sun had disappeared, and the 
night consumed the sky.

After the traditional sit upon the dock the two girls had retired to 
the special room they always had reserved at the local Saith inn. It 
was a special room only for use by the two girls, a hefty payment of 
ten thousand gold for a year&#146;s worth of guaranteed stays easily 
covered both the innkeeper&#146;s expenses, and his promise that he 
wouldn&#146;t speak a word of the transaction. For two years now he had 
enjoyed the comfortable arrangement, for it was nearly the second year 
anniversary that Mia and Jessica had been staying monthly in Saith. 
Two years since Ghaleon was defeated, and two years since Luna&#146;s 
rescue. Two years had the two girls been living dual lives, hating one 
while experiencing unbridled pleasure in the other. Though their trips 
to Saith only lasted one night and half of one day, the mere sixteen 
hours they usually got to spend with one another easily made up for 
the rest of the month&#146;s time where they were forced into painful 
social situations. Difficult peace talks with foreign dignitaries, 
dealing with the affairs of taxes and the public, and all the while 
keeping up the appearance of a perfect wife, both in public and in 
private, to their respective overbearing husbands. Neither Mia or 
Jessica felt love for the ones they were promised to, but the 
responsibilities of their positions forced them into marital &#147;bliss.&#148; 
So they endured, if no other reason for the people that followed them, 
but for at least sixteen hours each month, their lives belonged to 
themselves and to each other.

Near the door of their room their robes had already been discarded, 
and making a trail from the door to the large king bed laid the rest 
of the duo&#146;s clothing. Jessica&#146;s dress, Mia&#146;s second robe, two pairs 
of shoes, and various undergarments all made a detailed yet 
unnecessary map to the bed which laid directly in the middle of the 
room. Candles burned in each corner of the housing, and throughout the 
entire framework a light fiery hue was abundant in the atmosphere. The 
light in the room shimmered, constantly bouncing and in a state of 
uninterrupted motion, always bustling and always active, never having 
a second to rest. The candles themselves were a bit like the two 
women, who were deeply embroiled in a long kiss, their bodies both 
laying carelessly and nude upon the bed&#146;s comfortable mattress.

As was it normally was done, Jessica was firmly atop of Mia, her head 
pushing down into the magic girl&#146;s while her fingers were wrapped 
taught around the other girl&#146;s wrist, pinning them to the bed and 
rendering them unable to be moved. Mia&#146;s own prone body had both legs 
separated and spread, where Jessica&#146;s knees were bent down into the 
mattress, kneeling as she kissed into her lover. Their hair was both 
thrown about their heads, tangled and knotted with both each other&#146;s 
and themselves. The bare flesh of their bodies were pressed lightly 
against one another, and in the faint candlelight their skin was 
shimmering with a pale lighted hue. Their was silence in the room.

Jessica&#146;s kiss was an unusual one, but one that Mia had grown 
accustomed to, and enjoyed with great pleasure. It was a strange kiss 
that switched without warning to furious to gentle, occasionally 
bordering into areas that Mia had never even experienced before. 
During one second she could feel Jessica&#146;s tongue deeply within her 
mouth, while during another their lips seemed to just be barely 
touching. During a third it felt as if her tongue was being drug into 
Jessica&#146;s mouth, and it&#146;s cradle of flesh was gently scrapped along 
the edge of one of Jessica&#146;s sharp canine teeth. The kiss was in a 
constant state of motion, much like the candlelight and their lives, 
always adapting and always doing the best it could to keep up with the 
flow of passion. Because of Jessica&#146;s kiss, Mia was always surprised 
by something every month.

Wordlessly Mia did her best to keep up with Jessica&#146;s unusual kiss, 
and absently she worked on pushing up her wrists from under the beast 
girl&#146;s powerful grasp. The taller blonde&#146;s hands were a bit too strong 
to break free from, but after a few failed attempt&#146;s the grasp was let 
go and Mia&#146;s hands were free to play. One trailed up immediately to 
Jessica&#146;s face as they continued to kiss, and without cause or care 
Mia&#146;s fingers trailed across the odd ridges in Jessica&#146;s right cheek. 
She slowly stroked up and down the scar-like markings, up one line and 
down another, feeling the subtle ridges in what Jessica had told her 
was a family birthmark. Her other hand trailed down to Jessica&#146;s 
waist, where it laid on the soft flesh and gently nipped at the 
muscles in her midsection. Jessica was thin but also very tone, her 
body was rippling with tiny muscles that held a strength that belayed 
her frail appearance. The two continued to kiss, until Jessica finally 
broke it with a few unusual techniques thrown together in a matter of 
seconds. Their lips parted, and the taller girl leaned up, her face 
leaving Mia&#146;s fingers and her waist slipping from the magic girl&#146;s 
grasp.

Mia looked up with adoring green eyes to Jessica, and brought her 
hands up shyly to her naked chest. She did her best to cover her 
breasts with the length of her forearms, and looked up to the strong 
girl with a meek, almost frightened glance. Her look was one of 
playfulness, and her smile quickly broke the charade. She beamed a 
wide grin to the woman leaning over her, and smiled. All month long 
Jessica was politically forced into situations with her husband where 
she had no control, or no type of freedom, and typically when the pair 
got together Jessica was free to do whatever she desired. Mia enjoyed 
being in the control of the beast girl, and never had qualms about 
submitting to her sexual demands. She trusted Jessica wholly, and in 
that trust her pleasure was multiplied. She continued to look up at 
the woman she loved, waiting for the blonde to make some type of 
motion or hint at her current desires.

Wordlessly Jessica reached down with her left hand to grope at 
something between the mattress and the springs beneath. With a subtle 
motion she pulled something Mia had never seen before, that Jessica 
must have put their before her arrival to Saith that afternoon. It was 
an unusual piece of something that looked as smooth as metal, but was 
a faint blue in color and had subtle ridges on both of it&#146;s ends. It 
was at least eight inches long, and Jessica held it with her thin, 
tapered fingers, grasping it&#146;s smooth center and teasingly waving it 
back and forth. Mia tilted her head, curiously.

&#147;W...What is that?&#148; She asked, somewhat daunted, but her confidence in 
her lover unwavering. Jessica gave no reply, and reached down between 
Mia&#146;s legs with the object in both hands. Before she could ask her 
question again Mia was given a response by the feel of the object 
pressing against her gate, edged up against the folds of flesh and 
gently twisting back and forth. She looked down to where Jessica was 
regarding her with a large, chesire smile, and smiled back as best she 
could. She let her hands fall away from her breasts, and she gave her 
lover an approving nod. Jessica nodded back in reply, and then leaned 
down her lips to the edge of Mia&#146;s body.

She could feel the familiar texture of Jessica&#146;s tongue pressing down 
into the top of her mound, moistening the rim and slipping gently 
across the folds. Back and forth her tongue seemed to play, casually 
firing up and down along her flesh while the tip of the object still 
teased upon her opening. Shortly after the licking began Mia could 
feel her insides growing damp, her body reacting with lust internal, 
while the saliva from Jessica&#146;s tongue began to roll down the length 
of her folds. In a matter of seconds she felt wet from desire, and in 
noticing that, Jessica pushed forth with the strange object.

At first Mia felt as if it was just like what Nash put into her so 
often, his own nub of an organ that the magic girl often had to praise 
to appease Nash&#146;s fragile ego. But before long she could feel an odd 
sensation, the texture of the object and it&#146;s tiny projections from 
the smooth, metal surface, rubbing against her flesh and twisting it 
in ways she had never felt before. Her mouth opened up and she 
breathed a heavy pant of lust, her body quivering around the odd metal 
object and her fluids coating it as much as it would press in. 
Jessica&#146;s fingers were wrapped tight around the middle and she pushed 
it slowly past Mia&#146;s gates, gentle not to injure her and cautious to 
make her agape in desire. Her tongue continued to play on the top 
folds of Mia&#146;s sex, and soon the object was in as far as Jessica&#146;s 
fingers would allow, and her lips were firmly planted upon the top nub 
of Mia&#146;s sex, gently suckling at a sensitive mound of skin.

Mia&#146;s pant had turned into a low, deep moan, and her body shook 
visibly with the insertion of the device. The nodules on it touched 
spots inside her she had never felt touched before, and the sensation 
her body experienced was enough to make her feel dizzy from the 
passion. She let her moans go freely as the device was pulled and 
inserted once again, this time with a gradual clockwise twist as it 
was inserted. Mia pushed herself down upon the device even more, as if 
urging Jessica to go harder with the object. The beast girl obeyed the 
silent command, and soon she was fiercely pushing and pulling the 
object from Mia&#146;s gaping body, all the while her tongue and lips 
paying full attention to her sensitive outside.

&#147;J...Jessic...Jes...&#148; Mia seemed unable to speak her lover&#146;s name 
through her lustful moans, and her knuckles were turning white from 
the tight fists she had formed. Her entire body shivered with tension 
and lust, and before long she was beating down upon the object just as 
hard as Jessica was inserting it. Suddenly the sensation stopped from 
both the device and the beast girl&#146;s tongue, and Mia looked up to see 
what had happened to stop the activity so suddenly.

Jessica had pulled the object from her lover and was repositioning 
herself, turning around to lay on her stomach with her own sex close 
to Mia&#146;s. Mia&#146;s left leg was obediently raised by the feel of 
Jessica&#146;s forcing under it, and before long she could feel the heat of 
Jessica&#146;s own familiar sex, only two or three inches away from her 
own. Jessica reached back with the hand that held the object, and with 
a second&#146;s worth of maneuvering she placed it back within its place. 
The side that had just been in Mia was carelessly forced within 
Jessica&#146;s valley, and the previously unused section was put into Mia&#146;s 
gaping, breathing crevice. Together their sexes held it firmly, and 
Jessica pulled her hand away to grip hard to the bottom edge of the 
bed. Without a sound from either they began to thrust towards one 
another, both of their bodies gripping tight to the object, and gently 
probing each other which ever motion they pleased themselves with. 
Jessica was pushing forth hard from her place on the bed, her eyes 
downcast to the floor below and her long blonde hair scraping along 
the wood of its surface. She bit down hard upon her bottom lip, and 
tried to control her body enough to make love to Mia with the foreign 
device, her sex doing its best to grip and hold the object in place.

Before long the duo seemed to get the hang of their rhythm and soon 
were locked in a faster pace, repeatedly thrusting into one another 
with a feverish lust they shared once every month. The sound of flesh 
slapping along flesh could be heard emanating from the room, as well 
as the loud moans of Mia, and the lower, deep-rooted grunts of 
Jessica. Simultaneously the two women made love to one another, their 
valleys penetrated by one another&#146;s constant thrusting. The rhythm 
only continued to speed up, until Jessica&#146;s voice grew from a grunt to 
a low moan, a hard moan that went in sync with her hard, ferocious 
downward thrusts.

Mia could feel her sex tremble, and as Jessica continued to ream into 
her with passion, her body began to quake with an intense wave of 
passion. Her sex burst outward with a rush of passionate fluids, at 
about the same time she felt the heat and moisture of Jessica&#146;s. 
Together their bodies dislodged the object from them without the aid 
of a hand or a touch, and for a moment they both laid where they were, 
their sexes closely wedged to one another.

Mia sighed, gently, and closed her eyes in the aftermath of her 
climax. Her folds were gently wedged into Jessica&#146;s, making a subtle 
fit that shared their fluids and kissed at one another as their upper 
lips would have. She smiled a little, the flush of red appearing on 
her milk white cheeks. The sensation was comforting, though she 
wondered quietly what the Vane Guild would think of it.

After a few moments time Jessica pulled away from Mia, and then turned 
to crawl back into bed with her. She picked up the object they had 
shared and carelessly tossed it aside to the floor, to make way for 
her long, muscular body as it laid down beside the woman she loved. 
Without a word her arms wrapped around Mia&#146;s shoulders, and pulled her 
still-shivering lover close towards her bosom. Mia&#146;s head fell onto 
Jessica&#146;s breast, and her black hair worked to tickle and tease at 
Jessica&#146;s flesh. The beast girl smiled, and she held her lover closer.

&#147;I love you...Mia...&#148; She whispered, tenderly, and pressed her lips 
upon the magic girl&#146;s sweat-dropped forehead. The magic girl murmured 
a similar reply, and reached her arms up to grasp around the neck of 
the taller beast girl. She held onto Jessica, and her eyes closed, 
tired. Before long she was asleep, and Jessica was left with her own 
thoughts.

She kissed Mia&#146;s forehead once again, and as she did so her lips 
remained on the other girl&#146;s flesh. Wet streaks returned to her 
cheeks, trailing across her skin in long, sloping strides of sorrow. 
The tears rolled down her own face, and then met with Mia&#146;s, trailing 
down hers as well. As if they were simultaneously crying, the tears 
continued to run. Jessica cried, and held Mia a little bit tighter.

Sixteen hours were nearly up.
