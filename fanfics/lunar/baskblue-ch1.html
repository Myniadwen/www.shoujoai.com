<h1>Basking in Blue</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lunar/index.html">Lunar</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/gemakai.html">Gemakai</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	Jean stared towards the ceiling of her inn room, lying nude 
under the sheet as she always has, since it was more relaxing than 
wearing a dancing outfit or fighting gi to bed. She turned onto her 
side to see the Blue Star shining brightly onto her. Her eyes trailed 
from the window to the door, and she nearly jumped out of her skin as 
she noticed a person standing in the doorway. But the dancer quickly 
realized that it was just the blue-haired beauty from the lovely Blue 
Star.

	&#147;Lucia!&#148; Jean said hiding her charms with the bed covers, &#147;I-I 
didn&#146;t hear you come in.&#148;

	The princess of the Blue Star walked to the end of the bed and 
knelt beside it, her face in the Blue Star&#146;s light, but nothing else. 
&#147;Jean&#133;um&#133;can I sleep here tonight?&#148; Jean blushed, and looked away to 
hide it.

	&#147;Um&#133;can&#146;t you go with one of the others?&#148; she asked, nervously.

	&#147;Lemina&#146;s a little mean, Ronfar snores too loud and&#133;&#148; She 
couldn&#146;t find a reason why she couldn&#146;t be with Hiro, so she came with 
a reason to be with Jean, &#147;I just want to be with you.&#148;

	&#145;Oh Lucia, it&#146;s not that I hate you&#133;&#146; Jean thought in her mind, 
&#145;I don&#146;t hate you at all, I&#133;&#146; Jean gazed back at the lovely girl, who 
carried a pleading look in her eyes. Such an emotion stirred in Jean&#146;s 
heart when she looked at Lucia. It was a feeling that made Jean want 
to be with Lucia; to feel her and to be felt herself. However, she 
never shared this with Lucia, fearing that she wouldn&#146;t feel the same.

	&#147;Please Jean&#133;can I sleep here?&#148; Lucia asked again and Jean 
responded by asking a question of her own.

	&#147;Lucia, have you ever had a special feeling when you looked at 
someone? You know, like&#133;being in love or something.&#148; &#145;Did I just say I 
was in love?&#146; Jean wondered, but her thoughts ceased as she saw Lucia 
nod yes.

	&#147;I have&#133;and you&#146;re probably wondering who that person may be&#133;&#148; 
Lucia moved onto the bed and into the Blue Starlight, revealing her 
naked body with the exception of her pendant. Jean&#146;s cheeks grew 
crimson and her nipples became hard as the beautiful young woman came 
to her view, exposing her treasures. &#147;Actually&#133;Jean&#133;&#148; she spoke in her 
soft, soothing voice as she came closer to the dancer&#146;s face, &#147;&#133;I love 
you.&#148;

	Jean&#146;s breathing quickened, she grew warmer, and she reached 
towards Lucia&#146;s breasts and gently tapped a nipple to assure herself 
that this wasn&#146;t a dream. Lucia&#146;s face flamed with blushing and she 
released a soft moan. Jean smiled and tilted her head forward, gently 
kissing the Blue Star&#146;s princess. Lucia reached forward to the sheets 
covering the one she loved, and peeled them away. She examined Jean&#146;s 
tanned, sexy body while pondering where to place her hand first; she 
decided to land it on Jean&#146;s perfect sized breast, making the dancer 
moan into the kiss. Jean kicked the rest of the sheets off her legs, 
and pressed her knee against Lucia&#146;s entrance. The beautiful pale 
maiden gasped and exhaled a long, erotic moan, and she gave more 
pleasure to Jean by holding her other breast and squeezing both 
gently, with a bonus of rubbing her leg against Jean&#146;s already wet 
opening. Lucia parted their kiss and whispered into her lover&#146;s ear, 
&#147;Your skin feels so soft, Jean.&#148; Jean replied with a loud moan, 
enjoying every moment of this night. Lucia giggled before kissing the 
dancer&#146;s light brown neck and slowly worked her way down her perfectly 
formed body. The aroused princess lifted her hands off of Jean&#146;s 
breasts, so her lips could wrap around one of her erected nipples and 
suckle it with a lecherous craving. Jean arched her back, feeling her 
breast milk flow in between Lucia&#146;s sweet lips. Her ears were filled 
with a blissful &#145;mmm&#146; coming from Lucia. Jean&#146;s blue haired love 
remained on one breast, sucking out as much milk as would permit, and 
moved over to the other one where she could gain little more than the 
first. After drying out the second, Lucia resumed her quest downward, 
stopping only once at Jean&#146;s knavel to kiss it softly.

	&#147;Oh&#133;Lucia&#133;&#148; The dancer whispered, &#147;Please&#133;do me&#133;&#148; Lucia glanced 
up to Jean&#146;s face and smiled as she reached her love&#146;s opening. As if 
on instinct, Jean parted her legs, allowing entry for Lucia. The Blue 
Star&#146;s maiden marveled at the hairless pussy before her, and couldn&#146;t 
help but trace the area around it, while pushing it gently. &#147;Oh&#133;Lucia&#133; 
Please&#133;lick it&#133;&#148; The blue haired beauty giggled before parting Jean&#146;s 
wet pussy lips and began lapping at it. The emerald haired foxy vixen 
moaned at her limit, and brought Lucia in deeper by pulling her head 
in. With only a few licks, Lucia had found Jean&#146;s g-spot and 
immediately noticed a change in Jean&#146;s expression. It was filled with 
a burning passion, and oddly, an overtly overwhelmed look. Although 
she was overwhelmed, it was as if she wanted this to go ever on and 
further. Did Jean feel the same way that Lucia felt about her? Lucia 
raised herself from her love&#146;s opening and crawled over her body to 
reach her face. &#147;Why&#146;d you stop?&#148; Jean asked barely above a whisper, 
slightly testy.

	&#147;Jean&#133;&#148; Lucia whispered back, &#147;I told you that I love you, but&#133; 
do you love me?&#148;

	Jean stared deep into Lucia&#146;s emerald eyes, and just those eyes 
gave Jean that passionate euphora of sexual appeal again. She now knew 
what that feeling really was. It wasn&#146;t {just} about the sex, it went 
further. &#147;I do, Lucia. I&#146;ve loved you ever since I laid eyes on you.&#148; 
Lucia looked at her, and her face showed her doubt. &#147;Fine, you&#146;re 
gonna get it now,&#148; Jean said playfully. Jean turned both of them over, 
so she was on top. Lucia stared at Jean, a little frightened, but glad 
that her beloved confessed her love to her. &#147;Don&#146;t worry,&#148; Jean said 
like a kind nurse, &#147;This won&#146;t hurt, you&#146;ll enjoy it.&#148; She lined her 
clit with Lucia&#146;s and rubbed them together. Jean&#146;s partner moaned as 
loud as Jean did, a strong climax arising.

	&#147;Jean I-I&#133;I feel&#133;I feel like I&#146;m gonna&#133;&#148; But her words were cut 
off as Jean passionately kissed her, using her tongue to play with 
Lucia&#146;s. Jean placed Lucia&#146;s hard nipples in between her fingers and 
pinched them, creating a desperate moan and a mirrored reply from 
Lucia. Both of them were near their limits. They released each other&#146;s 
nipples and took hold of the other&#146;s waist and pulled them closer to 
each other. Both moaned the other&#146;s name, louder and louder, until 
they screamed a scream of sex as both came at the same time.

	&#147;Oh! Jean!!!&#148;

	&#147;Lucia!!!&#148;

	After their orgasms, Jean fell on top of her beloved, her 
nipples landing right on Lucia&#146;s. &#147;Jean&#133;&#148; Jean heard her love, &#147;I&#146;ve 
wanted this for so long&#133; My most grateful thanks&#133;&#148;

	&#147;You were real good, Lucia. Was that your first time?&#148; Lucia 
weakly answered yes. &#147;I see&#133; Hey, tell you what. After we defeat 
Zophar, I&#146;ll teach some more moves&#133; I assure you, it&#146;ll be a great 
learning experience.&#148; She giggled, but stopped when she didn&#146;t hear 
Lucia laugh with her. &#147;Lucia?&#148; Jean glanced to her love and noticed 
tears running down her cheeks. &#147;Lucia, you&#146;re crying.&#148;

	&#147;I am?&#148; Lucia looked back at her one and only. &#147;I wonder why.&#148;

	&#147;Lucia, we&#146;ll be together forever! I promise you that! Will you 
promise me?&#148;

	&#147;Jean&#133;&#148; The emerald haired dancer saw worry in Lucia&#146;s eyes and 
Jean could feel it. Like when a letter carries ill news, Jean could 
read it in Lucia&#146;s eyes. &#147;Jean, I&#133;want to be with you! I really do, 
but&#133;but I&#133;&#148; She felt her beloved&#146;s slender arms slide around her and 
bring her closer for a passionate kiss.

	Jean parted the kiss and whispered like a frightened child, 
&#147;Don&#146;t say that you&#146;ll die&#133;I need you Lucia&#133;You mean so much to me&#133;&#148; 
Lucia felt a tear pass on to her cheek as Jean cried. The princess 
wrapped her arms around Jean&#146;s waist, and kissed her softly.

	&#147;Jean&#133;I&#146;ll be here for you&#133;I need you just as much as you need 
me. I promise I&#146;ll never leave you&#133;you just promise that you&#146;ll never 
leave me.&#148; She passed her hand over the dancer&#146;s eyes, as if to say, 
&#147;Sleep now, my love.&#148; As Lucia fell to sleep, Jean stared at Lucia&#146;s 
calm, peaceful face as it laid in a peaceful doze before she too fell 
into a deep sleep.
