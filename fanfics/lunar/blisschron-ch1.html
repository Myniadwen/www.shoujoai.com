<h1>Bliss Chronicled: Lunar Majesty</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lunar/index.html">Lunar</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yumberduddle.html">Yumberduddle</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It became a custom in the years following the defeat of Ghaleon for 
Alex, Luna, Nash, Mia, Jessica, Kyle, and Nall to take a small trip 
throughout the lands of Lunar in the spirite of their fateful past
journey and in remembrance to the hardships suffered and the friends
lost during that quest.

It also was custom for Kyle to pass out in Reza, and for Jessica to 
remain behind with him until he awoke.  The others went on to the
bathing springs and waited for them to catch up.

On one such day is where this collection begins.

~~~~~~~~

Luna and Mia sat in the springs relaxing, waiting until Jessica and Kyle
could catch up.

The silence grew awkward after a few minutes, so Luna decided to strike 
up a conversation.  After all, it was rare to be able to talk privately
with Mia.

&quot;So, Mia...how is everything?  How have you been doing with the magic 
guild, and Nash, and reconstruction?&quot;

Mia smiled shyly.  &quot;I&#39;m doing well, I think.  It&#39;s hard, but I&#39;m doing 
well with Nash and my mother helping me.  Nash and I are well, thank 
you...and, um, how are you and Alex?&quot;

Luna&#39;s smile faded, and she looked down.  &quot;We&#39;re...okay...&quot;

&quot;Just okay?&quot;

&quot;Well...you see...um, ever since I became Althena again...as a goddess, 
my needs in...bed...are more than most people&#39;s...and Alex really can&#39;t 
meet them.&quot;

Mia&#39;s face was beet read as she stuttered, &quot;Oh, um, I, ah, I see...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just so frustrating!  I need so much more, but I have to keep it 
in...&quot;

&quot;I, er, wish I could help you somehow, Luna,&quot; Mia stammered.

Luna opened her mouth, then closed it.  She seemed to be struggling 
with herself.  Finally, she quietly replied, &quot;You could.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You could help me, Mia,&quot; Luna said, moving closer to her friend.  &quot;As 
Althena, I love all my people...in all ways.&quot;

Mia opened her mouth to protest, to scream-and Luna touched her arm.  
And suddenly, Mia felt it.  Luna had given her the frustration, all the 
pent-up lust within her.

All thoughts of protest disappeared from Mia&#39;s mind as her hand dove 
straight to her vagina.

&quot;What-what did you do-to me?&quot; Mia gasped as her hand began pumping.

&quot;I shared how I feel every day with you,&quot; Luna replied, getting out of 
the water.  &quot;You&#39;ll be free of it after one orgasm, though-so long as I 
give it.  Now, get out.&quot;

Mia managed to remove her hand for long enough to hoist herself out of 
the water.  Her body sparkled as the water ran down it.

Luna came just from the beautiful sight.  She leaned back against a 
rock as her body heaved, pleasure surging through her.

When her orgasm subsided, her eyese once more focused on her friend, 
who was desperately pumping her fist in and out of herself.

&quot;Come here, Mia,&quot; Luna commanded.

Mia whimpered and walked over to Luna.  Finally, she stood before her 
companion.

&quot;On your knees before your goddess, Mia,&quot; Luna gently admonished the 
woman.

Mia complied.

Luna spread her legs, baring her temple to her friend.  Mia&#39;s breath 
became ragged as her eyes remained riveted on the divine shrine before
her.  Her hands slowly moved toward it-

&quot;Hands on the ground, Mia,&quot; Luna quietly commanded.  &quot;Praise your 
goddess with oral worship.&quot;

Mia&#39;s hands fell to the ground by her knees.  She leaned forward and 
slowly, tentively, but eagerly, ran her tongue over the goddess&#39;s second
lips.

Luna gasped at the wonderful feeling of Mia&#39;s tongue on her temple&#39;s 
steps.  Slowly at first, it circled her outer path...then faster...
faster...oh, goodness, so fast, so slick, so wonderful...over and over
and-and-

And Mia removed her tongue and scraped her teeth along her goddess&#39;s 
outer heaven.

Yesss...

Luna gasped for breath, chest heaving, as orgasm washed over her as 
dawn&#39;s light over an unknown land.  Yes, oh yes...

As her orgasm wound down, one thought existed in Luna&#39;s mind.

More.  Her hunger had only grown.  She needed more!

This was wonderful.  Finally, it looked like she might be satisfied 
this day.

Her eyes roamed down to rest upon Mia, trying desperately to achieve 
release with both hands.

&quot;More,&quot; Luna gently, softly, firmly commanded.  &quot;Mia, you must enter 
me.&quot;

Tears sprung from Mia&#39;s eyes at hearing that she had yet more to do 
before the deity could return her services.  She struggled to remove her
hands from her center, shakingly placing them upon either side of Luna&#39;s
divine portal.  She drew the entrance open, and tentatively pushed her
tongue within.

Luna&#39;s sharp intake of breath at the fantastic feeling was nothing 
before Mia&#39;s.  The taste...the taste...it was liquid heaven.

Rational thought was driven from Mia&#39;s mind.  All she knew, all she 
wanted, all she understood, was that nothing in Lunar tasted better, and
that she needed every drop of nectar within this chamber.

And so she licked.  Up and down, around, left, right, here, there, all 
the time gasping and panting.  Wonderful, more, she needed more, there 
could never be enough, up, left, more, so good, down, right, so good...

So good...Luna could think of nothing else, her body shaking, her head 
thrown back, her hands gripping the rock she writhed against, her small 
shrieks coming with each breath as she hyperventilated...the tongue, 
everywhere at once, stroking her walls, so gooood...

Mia stroked Luna&#39;s clitoris as hard as she could.

YEESSSS!

Luna bucked, screaming incoherently as she spasmed from the joy.  
Droplets of love sprung to Mia&#39;s face, who licked them with fervor.

Luna breathed, heavily as she descended from heaven.  Her eyes 
readjusted as she looked down at her servant.  Mia lay on the ground,
viciously slapping her vagina and pinching her clit.

&quot;Please, Althena!&quot; she begged brokenly, nearly mad to have to bear the 
lust of a deity.  &quot;Please!&quot;

Luna&#39;s heart sank.  She was still not satisfied.  She still craved 
much, much more.  But this wasn&#39;t fair.  Mia needed her release, ashe
could be kept in sexual agony no longer.

&quot;Mia, come here,&quot; Luna commanded her sadly.  &quot;Sit upon my leg.&quot;

She braced her leg as Mia lowered herself onto it.

&quot;You may bring yourself to relief now, Mia.&quot;

Mia smiled gratefully and moved her pussy against Luna&#39;s limb.  She 
nearly fainted.  At the highest moment of orgasm, she had never
experienced pleasure before such as this.  Contact with the goddess was
more blissful than anything she had ever felt.

Mia rode Luna&#39;s leg, gasping at the wonderful, immeasurable pleasure as
she did so.  Her hand closest to Luna found its way to the goddess&#39;s
shrine as she did so, and she began to use her own pace to help set a
rhythm for pleasing her deity one more time.

Luna gasped happily as Mia pleasured them both.  Back and forth, in and 
out, they convulsed together, two bodies moving as one, as they both
came to release together, Luna sighing happily as she blessed Mia&#39;s hand
and Mia paralyzed save small jerks and spasms, inaudible whimpers
escaping her mouth at the sheer incredible pleasure that came from an
orgasm brought about by the touch of Althena.

Luna smiled happily as she rested upon the rock and Mia recovered on the
ground.  The magic was gone...but another touch would all it would take 
for this union to occur once more in the future.  She could not wait
until Jessica managed to catch up with everyone...between her, Mia, and
her daily sessions with Alex, perhaps today, at long last, she could
achieve satisfaction...
