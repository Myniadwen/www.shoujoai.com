<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>When she  was still living at the Hyuuga Estate, my mother used to say that even  birds with broken wings can still fly. I asked her how and she would  always say, “Because birds are the sky Hato-chan. They will become  apart of the sky and they shall breathe and live the sky.” I never  really understood that. And I still don’t, even now that Mother has  gone away to live with my aunt in a far away country somewhere</em>.</span></p>

Hinata  ran her thumb over bladed edge of the kunai. She felt a sharp pain  slice down the pad and looked at the thin line of blood. She placed the  ninja tool in her pouch while wiping the blood on her pants. She  wandered to her dresser and picked up her forehead protected. In the  reflective surface, the Hyuuga saw the sick, green color of the Seal on  her forehead. She took a deep breath and tied the headband around her  neck. Hinata opened the door and walked out of the small apartment she  was living in now, holding her head up even as malicious whispers and  taunts surrounded her.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Look at her, how pathetic.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Ha, so the Hyuuga clan finally cut off their liability.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Stupid bitch, walking around with that seal on her head.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>She should hide it like all the rest of those Hyuuga bastards.” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,  wimp!” Hinata spun and caught the rock that was about to smash into the  back of her head. A small group of boys, most likely Academy students,  began to laugh and point. “How can you call yourself a ninja? You’re so  weak, all of us could beat you with our hands tied behind our backs!”  Hinata said nothing, only dropped the rock and began to walk the other  way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey!” A stick collided with her shoulder. “We’re talking to  you, you stupid bitch!” The Jounin still walked the other way,  completely ignoring the young boys.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That is, until a small hand  roughly grabbed her wrist. Hinata towered over the boy and activated  her Byakugan, staring down at the now terrified boy menacingly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do  not touch me.” She ordered coldly. The boy gave a yelp and ran away,  back to the Academy. She didn’t know, or care really, if the other boys  followed him or stayed back to gawk. She did, however, have a training  session with a certain pink-haired medic.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Yeow!” Sakura yelped as Hinata’s pointed fingers dug into her side. “Easy with the Poke of Doom Hinata-chan!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop whining.” The Hyuuga chuckled. “I am not even using my chakra.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!? <em>Are you serious!?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Quite serious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You <em>gotta </em>be <em>kiddin</em> me!” Sakura shouted out, throwing her arms in the air. “I just got my  super sexy ass handed to me by someone who isn’t even using <em>chakra</em>! Tsunade-shishou!” Sakura waved her fist at an imaginary Tsunade. “Your teaching <em>sucks ass</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sakura-san.” Hinata sighed. “You are doing it again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh? What am I doing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You are shouting at nothing again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“..Eh  heh…My bad!” the pink-haired Jounin giggled, scratching her cheek.  Hinata smiled slightly. Sakura stopped and suddenly, her gaze went to  the mark decorating Hinata’s forehead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It must have hurt,” Sakura mumbled, pushing away the indigo bangs with a gentle hand. “the Seal I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The air suddenly went cold.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  would they do that?” the female member of Team 7 whispered in pain as  she traced the ‘X’ with the soft pad of her fingertip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop.” Hinata pleaded, trying to pull away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wanted to kill them.” The pink-haired girl confessed, moving closer.  “For doing that…everyone, especially Neji-kun, wanted to kill them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  chose it.” Hinata gritted out, wrenching her head free from Sakura’s  gentle grasp. The other ninja, however, wrapped her arms around the  smaller girl’s frame.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You did,” Sakura whispered, her lips  grazing the green mark on Hinata’s forehead. “And that just proves how  much stronger you are. Stronger than the rest of us…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up!”  Hinata screamed, lurching up. She got up too fast and ended up tripping  over her own feet. The breath whooshed out of her, leaving her  lightheaded. She crawled away, away from her friend, away from the  strange butterfly effect that was swarming in her stomach. Sakura got  up smoothly and yanked Hinata up by her left bicep. She pushed back the  younger girl’s bangs away, exposing the Cadged Bird Seal to the  afternoon sun.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let go of me.” The Hyuuga ordered softly. Sakura tightened the grip on Hinata.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think that’s gonna happen.” The pink-haired girl whispered back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I said let me go.” Hinata hissed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I said no!” Sakura yelled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Kaiten!”</em> Sakura was flung back as the small dome of chakra surrounded Hinata.  Once the ‘Heavenly Spin’ had finished, Sakura was already on her feet.  She growled and used the tree as leverage, propelling herself towards  the Hyuuga outcast with blinding speeds. Hinata’s Byakugan, however,  caught the movement. She shifted into the taijutsu stance of the Hyuuga  clan and when Sakura was close, she twisted away and used the other  girl’s speed against her, tipping the chakra-enhanced fist down into  the ground. Sakura yelped and rolled forward to prevent her head from  smashing into the rocky ground. She bounced to her feet and did a  handspring to get some distance between herself and Hinata.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You idiot!” Sakura snarled. “I am trying to <em>help you</em> dammit! So listen and listen good, cause I’m only gonna say this once! I am in lo—<em>Holy shit</em>!” She launched herself into air to prevent herself from being smashed into a pulp by Hinata’s Gentle Fist.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“Gentle my ass!”</em> Inner-Sakura roared. She ran towards the surface of a lake she knew and  mentally measured the amount of chakra she had left. It was looking  good, and Hinata had probably used up most of her chakra with the <em>Kaiten.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Eight Trigrams: Air Fist!”</em> Sakura wheezed as a blast of chakra and air pressure collided with her  back. She fell through the air and managed to twist enough the land  shakily on her feet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Neji-sama taught me more than the <em>Hakke Rokujuyon Sho</em>.” Hinata smirked. “Which, by the way…You are ins—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh <strong>hell</strong> no!” Sakura leaped away, hoping that she wasn’t inside Hinata’s territory. The Hyuuga followed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damn damn <em>damn damn<strong> damn</strong></em>!”  Sakura chanted as she used tree branches to go faster. Soon the crystal  clear surface of the lake appeared and Sakura pushed off and  somersaulted in the air to land on the water’s surface. Hinata followed  soon after.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha!” Sakura boasted. “I bet you don’t have any territory on the water!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fool.”  Hinata scoffed. “You think I don’t already know that? Why do you  think,” she suddenly shifted into a completely different taijutsu  stance. “I came up with this? <em>Ninja</em> <em>Art of Beast Taijustu: Washi Tsume Rendan!”</em> She flew at Sakura with an unbelievable speed and only used three of  her fingers on each hand, forming a “talon”. A small bit of chakra on  each tip of her fingernails made them razor sharp. She struck at  Sakura’s blind spots, scoring them with her “talons”. When the attack  faded, Hinata flipped away and slid on the water. She resumed her new  taijutsu stance, which looked like a feral version of her Hyuuga  stance, the only alteration being that the Hyuuga girl was hunched over  a little more and her curved fingers were lower than normal. Sakura  scoffed and used her green chakra to seal up the small scratches she  could reach.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s wrong Hinata-chan?” Sakura laughed. “Getting soft on me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  wish. I just don’t want to waste all of my chakra when you haven’t even  seen what I can really do with my Beast Taijutsu.” Hinata smirked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh yeah? Show me what ya got Hina-chan!” Sakura laughed, settling into a loose version of Tsunade’s stance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Ninja Art of Beast Taijustu: Ookami Hanone Genkaku!”</em> Hinata once again ran at the girl, yet she was much closer to the  water’s surface than before. “Claws”, each supported by chakra to give  the tearing capabilities, replaced the “talons” from before. In a  second before they made contact, Sakura brought up her knee and slammed  it into the Hyuuga girl’s chin. She gave a yelp and flew up. Sakura  wasted no time and began to unleash a barrage of fists on the surprised  Hyuuga. <em>“Shannero!”</em> she roared as she hit Hinata away with a  roundhouse kick. Hinata was flung into a tree, which groaned and  cracked under the pressure. Hinata coughed and licked away the blood  from a busted lip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not do—“ Hinata gasped in shock as the  muscles in her arms and legs failed to respond. A sickening thought  entered her mind; she had to have hit her spine pretty hard. What if  she was paralyzed!?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dammit!” she hissed through clenched teeth. “Move! Move!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  can’t. I shut off all of the muscles in your arms and legs.” Sakura  explained as she crouched down to the fallen Hyuuga. “A trick  Tsunade-shishou taught me to use if I was up against an opponent who  would be far stronger than me. All I had to do was catch you in a  combo.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bitch.” Hinata hissed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah yeah.” Sakura waved  off the insulting word. “I’ve been called worse.” For some reason, at  that thought, Hinata wanted to get up and introduce the ones who had  insulted the calm Haruno to a <em>Hakke Rokujuyon Sho</em>. She blushed at the thought. Or maybe it was because Sakura was currently pinning her unmoving body to the tree…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sakura-san?!”  If her muscles would move, Hinata had the sickening feeling that her  fingers would begin to tap together. “What are you—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want you  to shut the hell up and listen to me.” Sakura hissed. “Because, dammit,  I just got the courage to do this five minutes ago and I swear to God  if you make me stutter one time I will kiss the living crap out of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hinata’s eyebrows shot into her bangs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah that’s right—I’m a hormonal teenager. I can do those things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut. The. Hell. Up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hinata buttoned her lip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright.  I dunno why I feel like this, but I do. Maybe it was because you kicked  that bitch Konan’s ass for hitting me with an exploding butterfly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hinata faintly recalled slapping the female Akatsuki member several times.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or maybe it was because after, even though your arms were all burnt up, you carried me back like a baby.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oh  damn…Hinata blushed slightly. She had hoped that Sakura didn’t remember  the way Hinata had refused to let anyone else carry the pink-haired  girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe it was because you held me when Mom and Dad got  divorced. I don’t know,” Sakura leaned closer, greatly intruding  Hinata’s bubble of personal space. “And I frankly don’t give a crap. I  like you Hinata.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow,” Hinata sighed sarcastically, “Someone actually likes the Hyuuga failure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">SLAP.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hinata blinked and tried to register the fact that her left cheek hurt like hell and Sakura looked pissed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You…slapped me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You deserved it!” Sakura whined. She suddenly pushed her face right in front of Hinata’s. “I really like you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?” No way…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah! Like, ‘Naruto and Sasuke’ like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  LOVE YOU DAMMIT!!” Then, quite suddenly, Hinata found herself kissing  Sakura. It was…really…Her eyes widened when Sakura attempted to deepen  the kiss. So then, she did something she hadn’t done in over eight  years.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She fainted.</span></p>

<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  my mother was still living at the Hyuuga Estate, she always said that  even birds with broken wings could still fly. How about now Mother? Am  I flying even though I don’t have wings?</span></em>

---fin----
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A/N:  Yay, my first real SakuxHina fic. Meh, I had no idea what the hell I  was doing, so this might be a real piece of crap. I don’t care. This  was mainly to see if I could write fighting scenes remotely well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">FAIL.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Also,  some of you may be confused about the whole Konan thing. Well, Konan is  the only female member of Akatsuki right? And she uses origami  butterflies to attack. So, simply use your imagination for the fight  between Hinata+Sakura vs. Konan.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Damn. Well, at least I got to use new jutsu!! XD (Fyi, Sakura is really fun to write..)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">TRANSLATIONS:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-shishou:  Martial Arts teacher. Basically another term for Sensei. I heard Sakura  call Tsunade this in the first episode of Shippudden I think…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Shannero!”</em>-The Japanese version of America!Sakura’s “Cha!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">JUTSU:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Kaiten:</em> (Heavenly Spin) A dome of impenetrable chakra surrounds the Hyuuga a  complete 360 degrees while flinging back the attack. Can be expanded  and held.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Eight Trigrams: Air Fist</em>: A combination of air and chakra hits the opponent like a fist. Originally used by Neji in the Gai vs. Kisame arc.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Hakke Rokujuyon Sho:</em> (Eight Trigrams: 64 Palms) 64 strikes to an opponents chakra points. Has a wide territory.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Ninja</em> <em>Art of Beast Taijustu: Washi Tsume Rendan: </em>(Eagle Talon Combo)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Ninja Art of Beast Taijustu: Ookami Hanone Genkaku: </em>(Wolf  Fang Illusion) Since Sakura had to disrupt the damn thing I’ll explain  it. What happens is, while Hinata is runnin at her opponent, she uses a  small genjutsu to make the enemy believe there is more than one of her.  So it seems like a “pack”. Or something to that effect.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One last  thing: How the hell does Hinata know Beast Taijutsu you might ask?  Because one of her teammates uses animal like Taijustu (aka:Kiba). They  both simply worked on it and altered Kiba’s fighting style to suit her.  And why is it called “Taijutsu” when it uses chakra? I dunno. Seemed to  fit I guess.</span></p>
