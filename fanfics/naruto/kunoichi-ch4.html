<h1>Kunoichi-Ai (part 4 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../naruto/index.html">Naruto</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/elkat.html">Elkat</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../naruto/kunoichi-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Confrontation! The Hitsugi clan makes their move!

Team kunoichi broke camp little before dawn. None of the four women were 
able to sleep soundly through the night, fearful that the enemy would 
make another attack and were anxious to get moving again. Despite not 
getting enough sleep, they didn&#39;t feel safe and forced themselves awake. 
This wasn&#39;t a big issue for the kunoichi who were trained to sleep 
lightly nor Sizume who was used to waking at odd hours and marching for 
hours at end as a soldier. Barahime on the other hand was slow to wake 
and seemed to trip over the slightest of obstacle with her senses dulled 
from being half asleep. If Sizume hadn&#39;t offered to carry her, she would 
have slowed them down greatly.

The kunoichi and their charges were able to cover many miles before noon 
when they decided to stop and rest. While the kunoichi set up camp, 
Sizume and Barahime nestled together.

&quot;They really are a cute couple,&quot; Tenten said, looking at the women 
enviously.

&quot;I never thought that two women could...&quot; Hinata replied, her voice 
trailing off as she blushed.

Seeing Hinata&#39;s shy expression caused Tenten&#39;s heart to beat quickly. 
Was she reading too much into the girl&#39;s expression or could her fellow 
kunoichi share her secret. No, she doubted, it was obvious that the 
Hyuga was deeply in love with Uzumaki Naruto, but she was sure everybody 
the same of her towards Neji and they were wrong. Tenten, found Hinata&#39;s 
meekness to rather bothersome at times, but cute at other times such as 
now. The kunoichi was also kind to a fault and strong when she needs to, 
not mention quite gorgeous. The more Tenten thought about Hinata, the 
harder her heart pounded and the hotter her body burned.

&quot;Are you okay Tenten-sama?&quot; Hinata asked in a worried tone, seeing how 
the kunoichi&#39;s breathing had become shallow and the sweat the beaded on 
her face.

&quot;Y, yeah! I, I&#39;m just a little tired... I&#39;m going to wash off,&quot; Tenten 
said, quickly getting up and walking towards a nearby stream. Splashing 
cold water onto her face, she cooled down her burning body, scolding 
herself mentally. What are you thinking?! We&#39;re in the middle of a 
mission; there&#39;s no time to be thinking of that kind of stuff! Calming 
herself and regaining her composure, she was started to see somebody 
standing behind.

It was a tall masculine figure dressed in Manchu attire with a porcelain 
mask covering its face. Standing with arms intertwined with its wide 
sleeves, it bowed before pulling out one it&#39;s hands which had long, 
black finger nails and attacked with a stabbing motion at Tenten.

&quot;Hay, Hinata-san,&quot; Sizume said, watching as Tenten left.

&quot;Yes, Sizume-sama?&quot; Hinata asked looking at the warrior.

&quot;What are your feelings for Tenten-san?&quot; Sizume asked.

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know... This is the first time we have been sent on the 
same mission together. From what I&#39;ve seen, I feel that I can trust her 
and I wish I had her confidence...&quot; Hinata said, gazing into space as 
she tried to think.

&quot;Do you like her?&quot; Sizume asked, pressing onward.

&quot;Yes, she seems like a nice person to be around,&quot; Hinata answered, 
realizing the conversation was creeping onto a specific goal, though she 
wasn&#39;t sure what it was.

&quot;How much do you like her?&quot; Sizume asked.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Hinata asked, growing uncomfortable suddenly.

&quot;Do you like as a friend or maybe something more romantic...&quot; Sizume 
asked in a low tone.

&quot;W, What?!&quot; Hinata asked, blushing deeply.

&quot;What folly,&quot; the gloomy voice figured said, a gloomy woman dressed in 
black Manchu clothes. Her face was a painted like a corpse with stitches 
drawn her face. &quot;You trade idle conversation while your enemy ambushes 
you.&quot;

&quot;Peekaboo!&quot; Cries the cheerful voiced figure, another an almost exact 
twin of the gloomy girl, but in white as she bursts forth from the 
ground and grabs Sizume. &quot;Doton: Hadaka Maiso (Earth Style: Naked 
Burial)&quot; Suddenly, the girl and Sizume disappear into the ground.

&quot;Sizume!&quot; Barahime cries in horror!

The gloomy girl performs a number of hand seals. &quot;Kuchiyose no Jutsu: 
Teikoku no Yomigaeru (Summoning Technique: Imperial Revival)!&quot; A number 
of Chinese coffins bursts forth from the ground to open up and reveal 
the bodies of several women from the likes of the earlier attack. &quot;Leave 
no survivors.&quot; With the command, the corpses hopped out of their coffins 
attacked Hinata and the princess.

&quot;Byakugan!&quot; Hinata activated her dojutsu and began to attack the hopping 
undead. What happened to Tenten-sama? She wondered as she attacked the 
advancing corpses with her gentle fist.

Though Tenten been taken by surprise by the man, she was nearly able to 
dodge the attack, the claw-like finger nails cutting deep enough into 
her arm to draw blood. Quickly jumping back, she drew forth the scroll 
she carried on her back and unrolled it, summoning a number of kunai 
from it and toss them at the man.

The man dodged the kunai and charged forward, attacking in repetition 
with both of his clawed hands, force the kunoichi to continuously 
retreat in order to maintain her range.

Damn it, he&#39;s too fast! Hinata might have a chance with this guy... Wait 
a second, if he&#39;s the assailant, why is he wasting his time with me 
unless... Crap! I got to get to the others! Tenten thought as she 
repeatedly dodge the man&#39;s attacks. Not knowing the fate of her 
opponents caused her to become distracted, but she already knew she 
stood no chance again him. He was just as fast as him and could easily 
dodge her attacks if she were ever to far enough from him. She only one 
choice, to regroup with Hinata. Rolling up her scroll and returning it 
to her back, she turned away from the assailant and ran at full speed.

Oddly enough, the assailant made no attempt to chase her but instead 
began to perform hand signs. Suddenly a number of coffins bursts forth 
from the ground before Tenten, cutting off her retreat, the coffins 
continued to rise in a ring around her and the assailant.

There was no need for him to chase for he knew he could trap her, Tenten 
realized with horror. Fortunately for her, she had a slight upper hand. 
The coffin bearer was pretty wide, granting her with plenty of space for 
her to maneuver within, and performing technique required to stand 
still, creating a gap between them. Unless the assailant could perform 
ranged techniques (which she doubted), she just needed to keep her 
distance. Taking her scroll out again and summoning a variety of weapons 
she began to toss them while running along the perimeter of the barrier.

The assailant dodged the weapons left and right, attempt to close the 
gap between them, but finding the task difficult with the barrage of 
weapons be thrown at him. Realizing this, the assailant stopped in the 
dead center of the ring and began to observe Tenten&#39;s movement.

This made the kunoichi uneasy, though as a stand target, he became 
easier to hit, he was obviously planning the best solution against her.

The assailant made a number of hand signs and then removed his mask. Too 
Tenten&#39;s surprise, his face was Tenten&#39;s. She realized that he didn&#39;t 
just have copied her face, but was from head to toe now a mirror image 
of her. &quot;You are ranged combatant who relies solely on keeping your 
distance from your opponent and attacking from afar. Now that I have cut 
off your escape, I figured I fight you on even grounds,&quot; the assailant 
said with Tenten&#39;s voice.

Hinata panted as she stood bent over, having defeated everyone of the 
summoned corpses. She was exhausted, spending most of her chakra against 
the swarm of enemies.

&quot;You did well, no surprise that you were able to defeat my swarm last 
night.&quot; The gloomy girl said, bowing. &quot;I hope my sister has as much fun 
playing with you as I did.&quot;

Hinata, remembering the girl who attacked Sizume, focused her Byakugan 
on the ground while keeping an eye on her original opponent. She could 
not detect Sizume anywhere and could only hope that she was still alive.

Looking in all directions for the other assailant, she was nowhere to be 
seen, neither above or below ground. I must focus! Hinata thought, 
pouring the last of her chakra into her eyes. Suddenly, out of the 
corner of her eye, she say a figure ascending to the surface from behind 
her. Almost sure that it was the other girl, she was prepared to strike 
as soon as she surfaced. What surfaced wasn&#39;t the other assailant, but 
Sizume, who was covered in scratches and bleeding.

&quot;Sizume!&quot; Barahime cried running to the warrior&#39;s side. &quot;Are you 
alright?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m okay, that bitch tried to kill me, but I was able to beat her! She 
left as soon as soon as I fought back,&quot; The warrior said with a smile.

Hinata, realizing that she had turned her attention from the gloomy 
girl, turned back to find that she had disappeared. Not having much 
chakra left and unable to find any traces of the other girl anywhere, 
she released her Byakugan. &quot;I think they retreated. We must find where 
Tenten-sama went! I hope she&#39;s okay!&quot;

&quot;Er, maybe we should rest... you look pretty tired out.&quot; Sizume said, 
looking at the kunoichi.

&quot;I think we should find her... I don&#39;t think that other girl is gone,&quot; 
Barahime said, &quot;and with Hinata-san so exhausted, she has no chance of 
defending off another attack.&quot;

&quot;I guess so...&quot; Sizume said, sounding oddly disappointed at having to 
leave immediately.

The trio headed towards the river where they last remembered her leaving 
to.

Tenten was slightly disturbed by the assailant&#39;s new appearance, but 
didn&#39;t think too heavily into it. It&#39;s just a transformation technique! 
If he thinks he can scare me by stealing my face and voice, he doesn&#39;t 
know he&#39;s fighting against! She thought, summoning another handful of 
weapons and tossing them at the assailant.

At the same time, the assailant mimicked the kunoichi&#39;s actions, 
summoning the same number of weapons and tossing at her. The weapons 
collided mid-air and fell to the ground harmlessly. &quot;Do not 
underestimate me. I have studied your combat style and have prepared a 
counter measure. As long as you maintain your distance from me, you can 
evade my attacks and attack me from safely in return. Though I could 
easily close the gap between us, I find that would exert too much energy 
from myself from such a prolonged battle.&quot;

&quot;You talk to much!&quot; Tenten said. He must have studied my attack pattern 
so that he could mimic it. Additionally, the fact that he could summon 
the same weapons that I could means that this technique is able to copy 
my abilities and weapons... this is no different when I fought that 
doppelganger back at the Aakatsuki&#39;s base. If that&#39;s the case then... 
Tossing her scroll into the air while still holding it, it unrolled mid 
air and hundreds of thousands of weapons came raining down upon the 
assailant, making escape nearly impossible. &quot;Souryu Tensakai (Dragon 
Scattering Destruction)!&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; the assailant said, somehow able to stand as his body is 
pierced by several weapons. &quot;By tossing your scroll into the air, you 
can summon a great mass of weapons at once, leaving your opponent no 
room to escape and insuring almost an instantaneous victory. However, it 
expends every weapon within your arsenal, leaving defenseless if your 
opponent has by some means survived. It&#39;s a simple technique that 
requires no hand seals or chakra so I should be able to try it out for 
myself...&quot;

Tenten was shocked to see her opponent to be still alive. This isn&#39;t 
human! She thought in horror. With that thought in mind, she remembered 
the undead swarm she had fought the other night. Could he be undead like 
the rest of them? To make things worse, his ability mimic her own 
techniques now granted him a chance to use Souryu Tensakai against her! 
With the coffins blocking her escape, she would surely die!

Fortunately, Hinata and the others could be heard coming, causing the 
assailant to stop in mid toss. &quot;It seems my cousins have been defeated. 
That is unfortunate. Forgive me, but I must temporarily retreat. I&#39;ve 
enjoyed our encounter, Konoha shinobi. I hope to fight you again...&quot; 
Returning the mask to his face, he released the technique and threw a 
smoke bomb, causing a smoke screen to fill the ring. As it cleared, 
there was no signs of the assailant or the coffins, though the weapons 
that had pierced his body laid scattered across the ground, no traces of 
blood anywhere along the blade.

&quot;Tenten-sama!&quot; Hinata yelled, as she saw the kunoichi surrounded by her 
own summoned weapons.

&quot;Are you three alright?&quot; Tenten asked running to meet the team.

&quot;We were attacked by two women!&quot; Hinata said, explaining their encounter 
with the sisters.

&quot;I see, it&#39;ll only be time before they make their next attack!&quot; Tenten 
said, &quot;We better rest and prepare ourselves for the next battle.&quot;

&quot;Your arm!&quot; Hinata said, seeing the slash marks in Tenten&#39;s arms.

&quot;It&#39;s just a flesh wound,&quot; Tenten said, covering her injury with her 
hand. &quot;Though we should clean and bandage it before it becomes 
infected.&quot;

Hinata retrieved the small medical kit in which Sakura had given her 
before they left the village and attended to the kunoichi&#39;s wound, 
taking water from the river wash the wound clean.

After Hinata was done, Tenten went about gathering her weapons and 
sealing them back into her scroll before Team Kunoichi and their charges 
set up camp and rested for the night.

In the shadowy corridors of an underground room, two of the three 
Hitsugi clansmen rested from there battle against Team Kunoichi.

&quot;Everything is going according to your plan, cousin,&quot; the gloomy woman 
said, sewing close the wounds her cousin received from his battle with 
Tenten. &quot;The poison will kill one of the kunoichi and I&#39;m sure 
Maiso-imoto is capable of killing the other one along with the princess.

&quot;Though I&#39;ve lost a good number of bodies back there, I&#39;m sure the 
kunoichi will make a wonderful addition to my collection. I&#39;m glad the 
Maiso-imoto left this one in one piece. I should have it ready for our 
next encounter.&quot; Having finished repairing her cousin, she moved over to 
corpse of Sizume to which she stroked affectionately.
