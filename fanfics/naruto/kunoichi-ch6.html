Hinata stood panting, having defeated all the corpses with little trouble. I hope Barahime 
is okay, Hinata though as she ran down the cave. With the Byakugan activated she could see 
all around, including underneath her provided she focused her attention on the ground. 
Seeing no enemies left at the cave&#39;s front, she was worried. She doubt that they had been 
hoping for the dead to finish her off since she had beaten them once before and had the 
advantage of having the cave&#39;s entrance to limit the directions they could attack from. Why 
do this unless... They wanted to distract me! Looking at the ground she saw a humanoid below 
her ascending at a rapid pace. Leaping out of the way to evade the attack from the younger 
Hitsugi twin, she struck the assailant with her gentle fist.

Taken by surprise, the Hitsugi shinobi was sent flying back into the cave tumbling across 
the ground like a rag doll. &quot;You&#39;re as good as Itamu-nee says!&quot; Maiso said with a wide grin 
on her face. &quot;You even turned hit my tenketsu to limit my chakra flow and stun me! I hope 
Neesan turns into a masterpiece like she did with Sizume-san.&quot;

&quot;Masterpiece?&quot; Hinata asked, worried that the worse has fallen the female warrior.

&quot;Before the rigor mortis can set in or begin to decay, she washes the entire body in its 
insides with preservatives and chakra infused chemicals that continually creates calcium 
ions to fuel the contractions of the muscles. It&#39;s a lengthy procedure that takes a few days 
to do, but the end result is worth it. Though I hated pretending to be Sizume-san and be 
nice to you guys the whole time!&quot;

Hearing what the kunoichi said, Hinata shocked. &quot;Pretending to be Sizume-san... a number of 
days... &quot;Then the herb?&quot; Hinata asked, realizing that they all had been duped.

&quot;I made it up. I needed an excuse to leave our own hideout. Though I wouldn&#39;t worry about 
you friend. Sizume was only instructed to kill the princess,&quot; the kunoichi said with a 
smile. &quot;I wander how many little pieces did she cut her up into!&quot; Maiso giggled in a sick 
manner.

&quot;No!&quot; Hinata cried, running down the cave.

&quot;What a foolish girl, just turn your back and drop your guard to an enemy. Well it doesn&#39;t 
matter. I lost as soon as she countered my attack. Besides, our favorite of Itamu-neesan&#39;s 
masterpiece, Shiryu will take care of her.&quot; Maiso said with a laugh.

As Hinata ran down the cave, she couldn&#39;t believe how foolish they all were. It will be all 
my fault if anything happens! If only Naruto-kun was here, she thought. Though she idolized 
the young shinobi so much, it seemed that her mind refused to show his face. Instead the 
face that came to mind was Tenten&#39;s who probably was no doubt sleeping in a peaceful 
sleeping as death encroached upon her. Forgive me! Hinata thought, pain filling her heart. 
Tears brimmed on the edges of her eyes as her sadness began to fuel a strong remorse. NO! I 
MUST PROTECT THEM! EVEN AT THE COST OF MY OWN LIFE I MOST PROTECT THEM!

A lone figure standing in faint light stopped Hinata. From the way he dressed, Hinata could 
easily guess he was one the enemies. It was their Hitsugi&#39;s cousin silent cousin. Bowing 
before Hinata the mysterious shinobi formed hand signs and removed his mask. To Hinata&#39;s 
surprise, the shinobi&#39;s face was hers. Not only his face, but his entire body became a copy 
of her. &quot;My older cousin had told me everything about your fighting style the last time we 
fought. Though it seems you have a bloodline, I think I can compensate for the difference in 
our abilities.&quot; The shinobi said in Hinata&#39;s voice. &quot;I will enjoy our fight, Hyuga-chan!&quot;

&quot;Yes, you who lived a life of comfort and luxury that should have been mine! You who was 
pampered and loved when I was left to fend for myself once I grew old enough to do so and 
never loved by my foster mother! You who stole my life!&quot; the man hissed, grabbing Barahime 
by the throat and hoisting her into the air. &quot;You know nothing how much I suffered because 
of you! But now, now I can have my revenge! I&#39;ll make you suffer as much as you made me!&quot;

The princess, still lost in the shock despair of losing her beloved Sizume, made no attempt 
to fight free from the man&#39;s iron grip. Presently wasn&#39;t aware that anybody except her and 
Sizume existed and couldn&#39;t feel the pain caused by her own brother choking her slowly 
death.

&quot;Yes, hadn&#39;t you been born, our mother would have changed the laws our country just for me 
and I would have grown up to be first male ruler in a long time. Of course, I wouldn&#39;t allow 
any other men into this country; why should I when I could have all of the beautiful women 
to myself? Yes, exile the ugly ones and keep the rest as my personal slaves...&quot; the man said 
with a twisted laugh. &quot;As soon as you die, I&#39;ll have the Hitsugi bring you back and denounce 
you&#39;re right to the throne and pass the crown to me! Yes, it&#39;s still possible, but you must 
die first!&quot;

What brought a reaction to Barahime wasn&#39;t what her brother said, but the tears that began 
to fall down Sizume&#39;s lifeless face as the dead warrior&#39;s body began to shake. &quot;I-I won&#39;t 
l-let you k-kill her!&quot; the warrior cried, charging the man clumsily. &quot;I will not let you 
kill the one I love!&quot;

&quot;Sizume...&quot; Barahime whispered, a sad smile crossing her face.

Hinata and in the imposter traded blows with incredible speed. Though the imposter was 
incapable of channeling his chakra through his hands like Hinata, she suspected that even in 
this form being hit by him could dangerous. Hinata even had an upper hand with her Byakugan, 
but so the enemy. Where she had exhausted herself in the previous battle against the swarm 
of undead, the enemy seemed to be at full power. Eventually her opponent would outlast her 
and at the that moment, it would all be over. She had not but only one choice: defeat her 
opponent before it was too late.

Remembering what Tenten had told her about her own battle against the same opponent, it 
seemed that the opponent was capable of performing all techniques the opponent can provided 
that they&#39;ve seen it first. Since he claimed to be told about her fighting style, he must 
have in some way also experienced her techniques meaning that Shugohakke Rokujuyon Sho&quot; 
(Protective Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms was out of the question since she was forced to 
use it against the swarms in the three attacks). Also seeing that he recognized her as a 
Hyuga meant that using &quot;Hakke Sanjuni Sho&quot; (Eight Trigrams Thirty-Two Palms), to which was 
purely a weaker form of Hakke Rokujuyon Sho (Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four palms), would not be 
effective either. All that was left was... &quot;Juho Soshiken!&quot; She cried, charging her opponent 
while spinning. Chakra massed around her hands, resembling the heads of two tigers at it 
struck the imposter square in the chest, knocking across the cave into one of the walls.

&quot;A new technique to which I cannot copy or dodge, good planning Hyga-chan! I don&#39;t know how 
much longer you can fight or how many times you use that technique, but it doesn&#39;t matter. 
I&#39;ve stalled long enough, though it don&#39;t worry; the princess will be fine. It&#39;s not she we 
are after,&quot; the imposter said with a gentle smile.

&quot;What?&quot; Hinata said, confused to what her opponent had said.

&quot;You see our real mission was...&quot; the imposter began returning the mask to his face to 
dispel the transformation and then removing it.

The man was shocked at the sudden change of events and couldn&#39;t move, though he didn&#39;t 
realize that was because a pair of hands that extended from the ground clutched his legs and 
prevented him moving until it was too late.

With a downward slash of her naginata, the warrior cut off cleanly his hands, causing Sizume 
to fall the ground. Turning the naginata so that bladed faced towards the sky, the warrior 
slashed up, nearly cutting the man in half, but nonetheless inflicting a fatal wound.

As the hands in the ground let go him, the man fell to his knees. &quot;W-what&#39;s the meaning of 
this!&quot;

&quot;You were our real target all along; your mother had hired us long before you did on her 
death bed, wanting to protect her only heiress,&quot; Itamu said as emerged the rest of her body 
from the ground. &quot;Our mission was to locate ever one who wished to permit men to enter Yuri 
no Kuni and eliminate them. Also on the chance that you appear by one way another in the 
country we would draw close to you in order to learn of why. If it became clear you are a 
threat to the country, we were to eliminate you as well, but not before confirming it.&quot;

&quot;You traitorous bastards!&quot; the man cried, coughing up blood as he drew closer to dying.

&quot;You are fool to think that you could simply find a group of Iwagakure shinobi wandering a 
foreign land just for the sake of it! Even if you promised to pay us three times our 
original client, we obey all orders of the Tsuchikage and never abandon a mission given to 
us! For ignorance we controlled you like a marionette.&quot; For once the gloomy woman smiled, a 
hideous, mocking smile. &quot;Let me send you to hell personally...&quot; Drawing a scalpel from her 
clothes, Itamu brought it to the man&#39;s forehead and killed him personally.

&quot;Of course none other us and daimyo knew about the mission so that we could locate our 
targets easier and eliminate them. In fact, all of our jiang shi you defeated were once 
them,&quot; said a girl looked much like the Hitsugi twins, but was clearly older than either and 
wore the robes of their cousin. After removing her mask, her body transformed, becoming 
feminine. &quot;Because of nobody knew the real reasons of our actions, the princess had hired 
you to protect fearing that we were going to target her next.&quot;

&quot;Then why did you kill Sizume?&quot; Hinata asked.

&quot;So that she didn&#39;t have to suffer anymore. She never told the princess, but she was slowly 
dying from an incurable sickness. Before hand though we had informed her of our true goal 
and offered she wanted to help us. She gladly agreed though begged us to let her be the one 
to lead her to our target. It seemed that didn&#39;t trust us completely, quite shrewd of her in 
fact, and wanted to insure her safety. Oh by the way, before it&#39;s too late, I suppose I 
should give the antidote to our poison. Consider it a reward for defeating me,&quot; the kunoichi 
said, pulling a small vial from her clothes and threw it to her.

Hinata caught the vile in her hands and looked at it suspiciously.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, why should I give you something to kill somebody whose already on their death 
bed?&quot; the kunoichi with a reassuring smile. &quot;However, there&#39;s a special method to which you 
have to apply it. It&#39;s a secret of our clan so don&#39;t tell anybody!&quot;

Though Hinata wasn&#39;t sure if she could trust the kunoichi, she had no reason to give away 
clan her enemy&#39;s secret when one of them tells her herself. &quot;I won&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Good, you must remove the stopper and...&quot;

After the exiled prince&#39;s death, Sizume ran over to Barahime and removed the served hands 
from around her neck. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry for what I had to do, milady! I couldn&#39;t bare the 
thought of them capturing you so I chased you here myself! What I have done is 
unforgivable!&quot; The undead warrior cried, tears streaming down her face.

&quot;I thought I had lost you Sizume!&quot; the princess said, tears streaking her face. &quot;I didn&#39;t 
think I could live without you!&quot; The princess embraced warrior tightly and cried into her 
bosoms.

&quot;But milady! We cannot be together any more! I am no longer alive! I&#39;m a monstrosity that 
will outlive you!&quot; The warrior said, unconsciously wrapping her arms around the princess to 
comfort her.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter! I will always love you no matter you become! As long as you&#39;re with me, 
I&#39;ll be happy!&quot; Barahime exclaimed looking into the lifeless eyes of her lover with unerring 
determination.

&quot;Our cousin would envy you, Sizume. Her love was not so open minded,&quot; Itamu said with a sad 
tone of voice. &quot;Our mission has been completed, but we must still return to the capital to 
confirm it with our village. Since I doubt your original guards still live, as an 
unfortunate result of pretending to serve our target, we shall escort you there as well. I 
just need to gather the rest of my team who should be returning anytime soon.&quot;

Tenten slept peacefully, seeming to not have been awakened by all the fighting that had 
happened throughout the echoing cave. The fact that her breath was calm brought hope to 
Hinata&#39;s heart.

Sitting beside the sleeping kunoichi she followed the instructions given to her by her 
former enemy, Hitsugi Shiryu.

&quot;You can&#39;t simply apply by itself for it&#39;s in fact the actual poison we use, however if 
dissolved in saliva, it transforms into antitoxin that will cause the body become immune to 
the poison and remedy its effects. Of course with how long it&#39;s been in her body, her saliva 
has already been compromised thus will cause the poison to dissolve so in other words you&#39;ll 
need to dissolve yourself and administer it to her via mouth-to-mouth,&quot; Shiryu&#39;s voice said 
in Hinata&#39;s memory. Pouring it into her mouth, Hinata blushed, thinking of what came next. 
The poison dissolved relatively quickly, allowing for it to be applied incase any of the 
Hitsugi&#39;s allies were to become infected by their own poison. Even though this was merely a 
means to save her comrades life, Hinata couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that she was performing 
some sacred act of a forbidden ritual. Pinching Tenten&#39;s nose so that she be forced to 
breath through her mouth, Hinata leaned down and pressed their lips together.

To Hinata&#39;s shock, Tenten suddenly opened her eyes at that very moment, her face turning 
deep crimson in color. Hinata, having already transferred the antidote, sat straight up and 
attempted to explain the situation without very much luck.

&quot;They&#39;re cute when they&#39;re young,&quot; Shi Long said a smile, walking up to them.

&quot;Surely they&#39;re in denial!&quot; Maiso said, massaging the area that Hinata had hit her.

Though Tenten didn&#39;t recognize either of them especially with Shiryu in her true form, she 
recognized there clothes. Drawing a pair of kunai, she took a defensive stance, not at first 
realizing that she could move freely.

&quot;Hold on now! We&#39;re not enemies!&quot; Shiryu said, waving her hands before. &quot;At least not 
anymore!&quot;

&quot;So they are still alive after all,&quot; Itamu said gloomily as she walked down the cavern with 
the princess and warrior in tow. Seeing her cousin unmasked, she added in a obviously 
surprised tone &quot;I never thought you&#39;d reveal your true self to the enemy!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I trust they won&#39;t tell anybody about my secret especially after I gave them 
the antidote. However, we will have to improve the rate of poison in case we ever fight 
again,&quot; Shiryu said before returning the mask to her face and becoming the androgynous and 
silent person she had been before.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Tenten asked looking at the three members of the Hitsugi clan were ever 
so casually conversing with one another.

&quot;I-I can explain!&quot; Hinata said, still blushing.

A full moon lit the night as a small sailboat approached the shore of Yuri no Kuni. Each 
wore hooded cloaks that hid their identity and provided protection from the weather.

&quot;If our information is true, then Kyozame Kuroki and her allies have escaped into this 
country,&quot; said one of them, petting a cat that laid curled up in her arms. &quot;Because of the 
country&#39;s laws, no men can enter reducing the number of hunter nin that can pursue her. This 
is incredibly thought out for a mindless killing machine Kyozame to come up with such a 
plan, she&#39;s purely amazing.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not her plan then. She cares only about killing and doesn&#39;t try to cover her tracks. 
The fact that knowledge about her whereabouts and any current mysterious murders that have 
reported have ceased to exist until now means somebody&#39;s gone to the length to shield her 
from us... No matter who this master may be our missions stands and we shall only pursue 
Kyozame herself,&quot; the other said.

&quot;You know, this country has a special tradition... They say when two women confess their 
love one another that nothing can separate them!&quot; the first said nestling up against the 
second.

&quot;P-Please remember we&#39;re on a mission!&quot; the second cried embarrassedly. &quot;We have no time to 
play around!&quot;

&quot;Ah, you&#39;re no fun!&quot; the first said in disappointment.

As they nearly reached the shore, the two figures looked determinedly at the land thinking, 
You will pay for your crimes against the village! Directing the sailboat towards a nearby 
village, they both reached into their hoods and each removed a mask signifying them as 
hunter nin from Kirigakure, the Village Hidden in the Mist.
