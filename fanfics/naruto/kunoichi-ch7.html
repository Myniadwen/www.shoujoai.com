<a href="../naruto/kunoichi-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Hunters of Mist

Though their mission had ended, Team Kunoichi decided to take some time to rest and enjoy 
the land especially since the new Yurijo&#39;o, Barahime, insisted upon it threatening to cut 
all ties with Konoha if they refused. Though Yuri no Kuni wasn&#39;t a significantly powerful 
nation itself, Konohagakure treasured its alliances. Besides it was no more than 1 or 2 
days. For Tenten, this was the perfect opportunity to relax and think about all that 
happened during the mission. Though Hinata had explained to her what happened, the Hyuga 
would have no means to explain what the weapon master was feeling.

If only I could live here, Tenten thought as she sat in a massive public bath. The people 
are so nice and they don&#39;t really care what your sexuality is. It was true that many women 
in the nation where either homosexual or at least bisexual, but there were a number of 
heterosexual women who lived here too. Though many of the later tend to be either temporary, 
using the country to recover from what evils men laid upon them before returning to their 
homeland; sort of like rehabilitation. Indeed, many of the tourists that come here are such 
women who have suffered unimaginable acts by the hands of men. Though they were initially 
straight, many of them still participated in same sex relationships during their stay to 
return to their normal lives once they left.

&quot;Maybe I should be like them,&quot; Tenten said, but she knew if did, she could never bring 
herself to live such a lie.

&quot;Be like who?&quot; Asked Hinata, walking to the bath&#39;s edge wearing only a towel which made no 
attempt to hide the kunoichi&#39;s shapely body. Once again Tenten found herself staring at the 
Hyuga&#39;s full breasts turning away embarrassedly once she realized it. &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s just embarrassed that she&#39;s so flat-chested!&quot; Itamu said as she walked up behind the 
Hyuga and cupped the sides of her breasts in each hand, &quot;Not all of us can be gifted.&quot; She 
squeezed them for emphasis.

&quot;They say that if you rub them every day, they&#39;ll grow!&quot; Maiso said, emerging from the water 
with a great splash and cupping Tenten&#39;s nearly non-existing breasts in her hand. &quot;Though I 
have to say, your as flat as a washboard!&quot;

&quot;What are you two doing here?!&quot; Tenten asked as she and Hinata simultaneously broke free 
from the Hitsugis&#39; groping hands. &quot;Didn&#39;t you return to your village?&quot;

&quot;No, the Daimyo has invited us to stay for a few days,&quot; Itamu said. &quot;It&#39;s not like we enjoy 
staying in this country... these girls are too open in their &acirc;&#128;&#152;sins&#39; for our tastes. I bet 
not enough half of them knew what it is like to keep your true feelings secret.&quot;

Tenten was surprised, she never realized there was others like her; those who had to keep 
their attraction towards women a secret and live a lie. However what stuck in her mind was 
how she had referred to as &quot;sin&quot;.

It took both the Konoha kunoichi a while before they realized that Itamu had in her hand 
Hinata&#39;s towel. &quot;Eek!&quot; Each of their faces turned crimson red for entirely different reasons 
as the Hyuga kunoichi quickly hid her now naked body under the water.

&quot;Oh how modest! That&#39;s so kawai!&quot; Maiso cried, wading over to hug Hinata. However she was 
stopped as Tenten firmly grasped the kunoichi by the shoulder, unconsciously flashing the 
Hitsugi a threatening look.

&quot;You should really learn to respect other people&#39;s space, Imoto-chan!&quot; Itamu scolded.

&quot;But I can&#39;t help myself oneechan! Whenever I see something cute, I just want to smother it 
until stops breathing!&quot; Maiso said in a sickly warm smile.

The Konoha kunoichi shuttered at the last words of her sentence, wondering how much of that 
statement she truly meant. &quot;Um, Itamu, if you don&#39;t mind me asking... You call refer to er, 
you know it, as a sin. Does that mean you&#39;re...?&quot; Tenten asked hesitantly.

&quot;Yes, my sister and I are both lesbians damned to live in a homophobic country. In fact we 
are each other&#39;s lovers, but only because we didn&#39;t want to risk being discriminated against 
like our honorable cousin was,&quot; Itamu said, her usually emotionless voice noting a sound of 
sadness.

&quot;But can&#39;t you be open about it here?&quot; Hinata asked, embarrassedly. Though she had intended 
to ask her towel back, hearing the Hitsugi&#39;s hardship made her forget all about it.

&quot;You mean search for love in this cute little nation? This isn&#39;t one of those Yuri manga set 
in some all-girl&#39;s school! What if we did? We would have to return to the village eventually 
or be marked as rouge ninja and we can&#39;t bring her back! Outside of this country, we&#39;ll be 
forced to live a lie! For us who have done so for all our lives, it&#39;s nothing new, but for 
the poor girls we taken, they could never be happy! And lastly, long distance relationships 
never work out so we shall suffer in silence for it all we can do,&quot; Itamu said with an 
intense, unexpected anger to it.

&quot;I, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Hinata said under her breath, flinching.

&quot;Hay, it&#39;s not her fault! She&#39;s not like you! She doesn&#39;t know what it&#39;s like have her heart 
ache with the pain of loneliness! To tell herself that&#39;s it wrong to be attracted towards 
another girl! She doesn&#39;t know any of that, but nor do you know how she suffered!&quot; Tenten 
yelled, her anger uncontrollably bursting.

Silence descended the four girls.

&quot;Come on now, let&#39;s not get so worked up,&quot; Shiryu said, appearing in as little as a towel, 
taking her cousins by surprised.

&quot;Cousin-sama! Where&#39;s your mask?&quot; Itamu asked.

&quot;We&#39;re amongst allies now. There&#39;s no need for me to be hiding my identity. Besides, that 
mask gets sooo stuffy! I&#39;ve completed the mission report so I decided to take a dip! Forgive 
me for listening, but your out of place Itamu-chan. It&#39;s true that Hinata-chan knows nothing 
of our suffering, but it doesn&#39;t mean she suffered in her own way no? Besides I heard Konoha 
is as homophobic as Iwagakure. It must be so much trouble pretending what you&#39;re not isn&#39;t 
Tenten-chan.&quot; Shiryu said, removing her towel and climbing into the bath.

&quot;W-what are you talking about?&quot; Tenten said, trying her best to defend herself.

&quot;It&#39;s no use living a lie, but if you want to do something that futile, then I won&#39;t stop 
you!&quot; Shiryu said shrugging.

&quot;What the hell are you talking about?&quot; Tenten cried, her face bright red.

Is she saying that Tenten-sama is- Hinata thought, but her thoughts were interrupted by a 
splashing of water. At first she thought it was one the Hitsugi twins- either Itamu getting 
in or Maiso getting out, but the sound originated from across the bath where the steam was 
so thick that hid the area in a warm mist.

&quot;Oh man, this is great!&quot; a voice said hidden behind the mist said. &quot;I couldn&#39;t imagine 
spending another day on the road. My tongue is surely no substitute for hot water! You 
should try it Tsukihime!&quot; The voice was answered by a cat&#39;s mew.

&quot;We can&#39;t be staying here for too long. The fact that this town still stands is proof that 
Kyozame can&#39;t be close to here. We must find her at once and bring her to justice for her 
crimes against the village!&quot; said another voice.

&quot;Ah, you&#39;re no fun! All work and no play makes Master a dull kitten!&quot; the first voice said. 
&quot;Besides, we got some really reliable information that some odd people have come here.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think the local cats count as reliable informants,&quot; the other voice said.

&quot;Ah, you&#39;re so mean!&quot; The first said, sniffling.

&quot;I-I&#39;m so sorry! Please don&#39;t cry! I&#39;ll do anything, just don&#39;t cry!&quot; the second voice said.

&quot;Anything?&quot; The first voice said in a low voice, sly tone.

The sound of somebody through the water could be heard.

&quot;Hay! What are you doing? Wait, don&#39;t do that! What if somebody comes here?&quot; the second 
voice said.

&quot;Come on Master, we don&#39;t have to pretend any more...&quot; There was a sound of lips connecting 
and a series of inappropriate sounds began to emit through the mist.

The five kunoichi looked at the mist shrouded couple with a sense of shock.

Th-they&#39;re-! Hinata thought, dumbfounded.

&quot;Oh my, these gaijin are so naughty!&quot; Shiryu said with a giggle.

&quot;Oops! It looks like somebody was here already!&quot; the first voice said.

&quot;What?&quot; the second voice cried in shock.

The steam lifted, revealing two women with long black hair, one of them with her arms 
wrapped about the other. On the pools edge, a black cat laid curled up on a towel, trying to 
sleep and having a bad time at it.

&quot;We&#39;re so sorry!&quot; one the girls said, the owner of the second voice, as she pushed off of 
her. &quot;We didn&#39;t anybody else was here!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s so kawai when master gets embarrassed!&quot; the other girl, owner of the first voice, 
said, wiggling about. &quot;She&#39;s so irresistible!&quot; She jumped onto the first girl who turned her 
back to her to face the kunoichi, knocking her down into the water. Their bodies was 
splashing for a matter of time before it died down followed by bubbles rising to the top of 
the water for a few seconds before it too stopped.

The kunoichi looked to one another worriedly, not sure if the two women were still alive. 
Just as Hinata was about to use the Byakugan, the girls&#39; heads burst from the water gasping 
for air.

&quot;My, these gaijin are so funny!&quot; Shiryu said, giggling.

&quot;I think it&#39;s time to get out,&quot; the first girl said, climbing out of the bath.

&quot;Ah! I was just beginning to have fun!&quot; the other girl said, following after her.

The women walked out of the bath and headed back to the changing room to get dressed. To the 
kunoichi&#39;s mixed embarrassment and amusement, any towels they had been wearing was now lost. 
Not soon afterwards the kunoichi decided to get out themselves.

Despite the full moon that lit the night sky, it was dark, ominously so in fact. For the 
guards standing at their posts, they were unnerved for they could feel it. Something was 
near, something with an intense killing intent. There was no sounds of life except for their 
own breathing to be heard as their eyes shot from corner to another expecting a demon to 
jump at them at any second. Suddenly, laughter could be heard echoing through the village.

This was not the laughter a child at play or lovers sneaking out to rendezvous, but a high 
pitched, heart wrenching laughter of madness and death. What made things worse was that it 
came from inside the village.

A low laugh from behind the guards caused them to jump, drawing their weapons and ready to 
face a demon. What stood before them was a woman dressed in tattered funeral clothes and 
wrapped in old bandages smiling a toothy grin. Two pricks of light emitted from her empty 
eye sockets as she looked each with undisguised malice. The chain that was attached to an 
iron collar around her neck rustled, the last, broken link amazing remaining in place. With 
a sharp laugh she impaled each of the guards with her bony hands that ended in long, black 
claw-like nails before they could react. They last things the guards saw before passing on 
the next world was the blood stained streets and the mist forehead protector wrapped about 
the woman&#39;s waste.

&quot;You&#39;re enjoying yourself tonight,&quot; said an albino miko dressed in red. She sat in the midst 
of corpses petting a skull she held in her lap.

&quot;Why feel so alive when I kill!&quot; the woman said, throwing her head in a maniacal laugh.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t be surprised, it might as well be that you&#39;re stealing their life when you kill 
them!&quot; the miko said, smiling at the woman. &quot;Don&#39;t you agree, Mimi?&quot;

Mimi, a kunoichi with shaggy black hair dressed in an unzipped zippered hoodie over a mesh 
shirt and camouflage patterned cargo pants, didn&#39;t reply. Out her only eye (the other 
covered by her forehead protector that she wore diagonally), she looked down at the skeletal 
dog standing beside her. By the markings on her face, there was no doubt she was from the 
Inuzuka clan. Shiroko...

Despite being clearly dead, the skeletal dog looked up at its mater and nuzzled its 
fleshless nose in her leg.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, girl...&quot; Mimi said, kneeling down and petting the undead dog on the head.

&quot;To bad there&#39;s no body left,&quot; the woman in tattered white said, sighing.

&quot;I guess its time to move on the next village. I&#39;ll select the bravest of these women and 
revive them,&quot; the miko said, standing up.

&quot;I can&#39;t wait,&quot; the woman said with a cruel grin.

Tenten woke in a cold sweat from a nightmare that she could she could no longer remember now 
that she was awake. However she knew for sure that it was most disturbing things she had 
ever dreamt in her entire life. Fearing that the nightmare waited for her to return, she 
decided to take some time to clear her mind and possibly banish the nightmare (whatever it 
might be of) from her rest. Making sure that her yukata was tightly tied, she slipped into a 
pair of slippers left the room of the inn that she and Hinata was staying at.

She began walking down the hall, but didn&#39;t make it past the door of the Hyuga&#39;s room. Out 
of either curiosity or worry, she decided to listen to whatever was happening in her team 
mate&#39;s room. The first thing she heard was the soft, rhythmical breathing of the sleeping 
kunoichi; a truly pleasing sound. Pushing the sound aside, she listened harder, searching 
for anything that could suggest that was in any danger. After a long moment and no change in 
the sounds emitting from the kunoichi&#39;s room. Relaxing, Tenten continued her stroll down the 
hallway, glad that Hinata was safe.

&quot;It must be so much trouble pretending what you&#39;re not, isn&#39;t Tenten-chan.&quot;

The Hitsugi&#39;s words echoed through her mind. A part of her wanted to answer &quot;It&#39;s too 
unbearable&quot;, but she feared of what Hinata would think of her. She probably already knew and 
made the thought made the kunoichi&#39;s heart beat faster. This feeling? Could I- No, she 
wouldn&#39;t be interested... She&#39;s in love with Naruto- Why did I have to be born a girl? She 
thought, aimlessly wandering. She was so lost in thought that once she remembered to watch 
where she was going, she realized she hadn&#39;t a clue where she was.

The inn was impressively large and held the reputation for being most popular tourist 
attraction in all of Yuri no Kuni. Before Tenten could back track and, hopefully, find her 
way back to her room, she was distracted by the sound of clashing blades. The sound came 
from a nearby room in which Tenten crept to, drawing a kunai she had hidden in her sleeve 
before leaving her room. Slowly she opened the sliding the door as quietly as possible just 
enough so that she could see what was happening.

Other than the moonlight that shined through the window, the room was too dark to make out 
any details except two silhouettes were locked in battle, each carrying two small swords. By 
the kunoichi&#39;s limited knowledge of swordsmanship, she could only determine that they were 
skilled, but something seemed odd about their movements. After watching each intently, she 
noticed that for every move one took the other mirrored and that they blades always 
connected in a perfect performance.

Tenten was forced to leap away as something slashed through where she had been standing. The 
assailant was humanoid in shape, but stood in the same fashion as a quadrupedal animal. 
Tenten dodged an attack from another assailant that looked the same as the first. Flanked, 
she tried to determine her next actions when a pair of blades cut through the paper walls 
and formed an &quot;X&quot; pattern over Tenten&#39;s neck, pinning her to the wall.

&quot;Before we kill you, tell us where Kyozame Kuroki is!&quot; one the assailants on either side of 
the kunoichi asked.

&quot;Who?&quot; Tenten asked, not recognizing the name.

&quot;Don&#39;t play dumb with us? We know that&#39;s she here! Know tell us where she is and we&#39;ll make 
your death swift and painless!&quot; The assailant demanded. Right afterwards, the assailant was 
knocked aside by another figure.

The figure was tall and masculine, turning out to be- in no surprise, Shiryu who was once 
again wearing her mask.

&quot;Can&#39;t a kunoichi get any sleep?&quot; said a very disgruntled sounding figure, holding something 
small to the throat of the other assailant. By the gloomy tone of the voice it was no doubt, 
Itamu.

&quot;I was just getting to the best part too!&quot; said another voice, the blades that held pinned 
Tenten to the wall suddenly slipping away.

&quot;Master!&quot; cried one of the assailants.

The assailant&#39;s voice echoed through Tenten&#39;s head and triggered memories from a few hours 
back. &quot;Don&#39;t hurt them! I think it&#39;s all one big misunderstanding!&quot; Tenten said.

&quot;You can say that again,&quot; Itamu said stepping into the light holding a black cat by the 
scruff of its neck. The cat hissed and growled, trying its hardest to escape the kunoichi&#39;s 
grip. &quot;This was one of them.&quot;

Shiryu stepped forward holding a mask that the assailant had been wearing in her hand. It 
was the type of mask that only Hunter Nin from Kirigakure would where.

&quot;Looks like you have some explaining to do Hunter-chan!&quot; Maiso said cheerfully.

&quot;We are currently on a mission to seek out Kyozame Kuroki and kill her, taking her head back 
for proof. She has caused the deaths of several of our own men including those who&#39;ve 
already been sent after her. To make matters worse, she has some unknown ability to animate 
those she kills and turn them into mindless monsters that know only to kill... They don&#39;t 
discriminate against age, gender or if relation, they kill everyone they see...&quot; spoke the 
woman from the baths. Her name was Tachi Yurotora and claimed to be the only survivor of her 
clan. She wore a black kimono and hakama and wore two kodachi at her sides, an odachi on her 
back and a tachi across her waist from behind. Her bangs fell in front of the metal plate of 
her forehead protector hiding it, more likely out of fashion rather than any practical 
meaning. Every inch of her radiated with the aura of a master swordsman.

The Hitsugis (including an again unmasked Shiryu) looked to one another and shook their 
heads. &quot;We don&#39;t know of anyone by that name and we know everything of our rivals,&quot; Shiryu 
said, stressing the emphasis on &quot;everything&quot; to give it credence. &quot;Besides, zombiism is not 
too uncommon in this world of ninjas, but the question is how she does it.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not sure of that ourselves...&quot; said the other hunter nin, a girl that wore 
minidress-like kimono with overly long sleeves, a black dog collar attached with a brass 
bell and stylish greaves. Her name was Nekomi and she referred to herself to being &quot;Tachi&#39;s 
pet&quot; despite the other kunoichi&#39;s denial of such. She wore her forehead protector as a 
bandana with a pair of cat-ears attached to the top. The small black cat, Tsukihime, lay in 
her lap curled in a ball fast asleep.

&quot;And you attacked me thinking that I knew something about her...&quot; Tenten said, &quot;That means 
she&#39;s not alone.&quot;

&quot;No, Kyozame is a cold hearted killer that rarely troubles herself with thoughts other than 
how she&#39;s going to torture her next victim before she kills them. The fact she simply 
disappeared without leading a trail of blood to follow and now simply reappear in somewhere 
that nearly have of our available shinobi cannot enter without causing an international 
event means that somebody&#39;s leading her, probably with promises of being able to kill as 
much as she wants. This individual is possibly has a number of other followers like Kyozame 
who are possibly nuke-nin themselves and will protect their leader with their lives,&quot; Tachi 
said.

&quot;Why did she only send you two?&quot; Hinata asked.

&quot;Because we&#39;re the best!&quot; Nekomi said, winking and smiling proudly.

&quot;Because I demanded to be the one who takes her head,&quot; Tachi said, drawing her blade and 
looking at it with cold determination. The sadness in her eyes spoke volumes of her 
suffering. The path of an avenger was never easy.

&quot;Oh Master! You make me so hot when you get so serious!&quot; Nekomi cried, pouncing on the 
swordswoman.

&quot;Wait! Not here!&quot; Tachi cried, barely having enough time to sheathe her kodachi as the 
girl&#39;s hands tried to work their way under her robes.

Hinata and Tenten&#39;s face turned bright red and the Hitsugis (even including the normally 
cheerless Itamu) chuckled at them the Kiri girls.

Tsukihime, who had sensed this beforehand her master&#39;s actions and jumped off her lap, was 
now wandering about the room. Suddenly the hair on the cat&#39;s back stood on end as it hissed 
violently.

&quot;There here!&quot; Nekomi said with a sly grin, the look a cat who knows that has trapped a mouse 
reflecting on her face.

An army of stumbling bodies slowly moved to the capital. The three women who had single 
handed slaughtered them lead them in their imperfect march.
