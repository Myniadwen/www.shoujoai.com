<h1>In Media Res</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../naruto/index.html">Naruto</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/lemonlime.html">MissLemonlime</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	One night. The sounds echoed through the forest. So loud. So 
sweet. Had any one been there they would have heard. 

	A thousand thoughts ran through the beautiful girls&#39; mind. Was 
what she was doing right? Would her friends find out? If they did, would 
she have any friends? With all of these thoughts she could hardly get an 
orgasm going. But then she looked down at the gorgeous blonde rubbing 
her finger up and down the dripping sex of the pink haired beauty. None 
of it mattered any more. Ino was happy. She was truly, truly happy. If 
her friends didn&#39;t realize that, then who needs them.

	Sakura smiled as she felt herself reach orgasm.

	&quot;OH, GOD YES! AAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!&quot;


(Three days earlier. 7:00 A.M.)

	The sun shone beautifully on this wonderful day in February. The 
cherry blossom season was fast approaching and the weather was dazzling. 
As Sakura walked down the street she lingered for a while to absorb the 
lovely surroundings. The sun was shining, not a cloud in the sky. And as 
she stared into the forest that stood strong and tall a mile outside of 
Konoha, she felt a wave of joy surge through her body.

	It seemed like the villagers were enjoying the day just as much as 
she was.

	At the local flower shop, Yamanaka Ino was watering some of the 
cherry blossoms that were looking a little dry. She loved to spend her 
time at her families shop. Flowers were her passion. The beauty of 
nature made her feel like she was at peace with the earth. Cherry 
blossoms were her favorite flower. The lovely colors evoked an emotion 
that she had only felt once before.

	She felt it the time she was with Sasuke.

	As Ino put some fresh flowers by the window for people to admire, 
she looked out of the corner of her eye to see her old friend and long 
time rival. Sakura was eying a cute skirt in the cloths shop next door 
when she turned and recognized Ino.

	&quot;Oh my god, Ino. How have you been?&quot;

	&quot;Sakura, I&#39;m doing fine, how about you. Oh, how long has it been?&quot;

	&quot;To long. I&#39;m so glad to see you.&quot;

	The two beauties approached each other with utter delight in their 
hearts and their smiles. Sakura had been training with Tsunade for about 
a year, and between her training and the upcoming chunnin exam, she had 
barely seen any of her classmates at all. Over the months she had gotten 
very lonely, and she yearned to have a friend to talk to. Someone who 
she could open up to. Someone who would bare her troubled soul. And 
lately it was very troubled. 

	&quot;Do you want to take a walk around town,&quot; asked Ino in a cheery 
voice.

	&quot;That would be great,&quot; replied Sakura in a soft, sluggish voice.

	Ino pretended not to notice, but she could tell that something was 
bothering Sakura. Her expression practically spelled it out.

	As the two girls walked down the road, they shared all of the 
stories of the past year. They talked about their ninja training, the 
people they met, and the lives they lived. As the sun grew tired the 
hours grew long for Sakura. Her tone became deeper, and her sighs became 
more frequent. Ino continued to hold back on saying anything, knowing 
that asking would only get a sour response.

	After about an hour of walking, they decided to go over to 
Sakura&#39;s house to get a bite to eat. When they arrived they both sat 
down on the couch and continued to share stories.

	&quot;Your joking, right,&quot; asked Sakura.

	&quot;Dead serious. Rock Lee and Hinata were put on a mission together 
to defend an oil mine from small scale terrorists. When they got back, 
Hinata was two months pregnant. I&#39;m not sure if it was Lee, but who else 
could it have been.&quot;

	&quot;I always thought that it would be Naruto and Hinata, but Lee.&quot; 
Sakura sighed a long, deep sigh.

	Ino knew that if she was going to say something, she had to say it 
now.

	&quot;Sakura, what&#39;s wrong.&quot;

	&quot;What do you mean.&quot;

	&quot;You know what I mean. Don&#39;t do this, you can tell me. What&#39;s 
wrong.&quot;

	Sakura tried to keep her emotions from pouring out of her for a 
few more seconds, but it was a hopeless effort. Moisture culminated in 
her eye and a single tear slid down her cheek and dropped off of her 
chin, soon to be followed by several others.

	Ino wrapped her arms around the sobbing girls shoulders, gently 
rubbing her back and comforting her.

	Sakura barely managed to speak through her sobs. &quot;I&#39;ve b-been 
trying to harden m-my heart and forget all about my l-life with team 7 
and the rest of you. Tsunade told me that the l-less I thought about 
painful memories, the less I would f-feel the p-pain. But the harder I 
try, th-the more pain I feel. I can&#39;t stop th-thinking that .... 
that.... Sasuke isn&#39;t coming back.&quot;

	Ino continued to caress Sakura&#39;s delicate shoulders, making sure 
not to cause her any stress or pressure. She cycled through her mind for 
anything that would make the pink haired girl feel better. Sasuke was 
this lovely girls heart and soul. Nothing but love could replace him.

	Then a lightbulb went off in Ino&#39;s head as she did something she 
never thought she would do.

	Ino leant down towards Sakura&#39;s beautiful face and planted a soft, 
warm kiss on her cheek. The tears stopped immediately as she opened her 
eyes.
