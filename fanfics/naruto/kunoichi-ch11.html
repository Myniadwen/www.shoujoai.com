<a href="../naruto/kunoichi-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Concerns of the Heart

The kunoichi slowly regroupped as they tried to peace together what had happened. Their 
victory left a stale taste in mouth as they pondered if they had really won their battle. 
For Konoha kunoichi, Tenten and Hyuga Hinata, they were confused and worried. They had 
completed their initial mission, but now a new threat had raised it&#39;s ugly head and there 
was nothing they could do to help. They knew nothing of the enemy except that that this was 
only the beginning of a new war.

Driven by curoisity, they walked allong the city&#39;s walls, inevitably coming accross the 
Tachi. The stern swordswoman stood on knee, her body shaking spasmatically. Worried at her 
sight, the kunoichi hastened their pace into a run. It was only as they got closer cloud 
they see the warrior&#39;s face distraught and wet with tears did they realize that she had been 
crying.

Hearing the approaching kunoichi, the warrior quickly wiped her tears away and picked 
herself up, attempting to appear as dignified as her emotionally wracked body would permit. 
She didn&#39;t try to look at them, knowing that her eyes would betray her. &quot;You are victorous?&quot; 
She asked, pretty sure she already knew the answer, but hoped for otherwise.

&quot;Define victory,&quot; Tenten said sadly.

&quot;We won, but...&quot; Hinata said, looking at the ground.

Anger gripped the warrior&#39;s body. &quot;They were just toying with us!&quot; She hissed, clenching her 
fists so hard that they began to bleed.

&quot;No I think this was a test,&quot; Said Itamu as she and the three other Iwa kunoichi came to the 
gates, &quot;This is, after all, the capital of an entire nation. It would be foolish to have 
charged in person without knowing every trick the enemy had. Sure they could easily dispatch 
the known forces, but any clever strategist will keep it&#39;s ace a secret from the enemy for 
as long as possible and make sure once it&#39;s been revealed that the enemy doesn&#39;t have the 
chance of telling others of it. By throwing these puppets at us, they lure out the ace and 
once they figure its strengths and weaknesses and insure there&#39;s no other secret threats, 
they can attack with confidence.&quot;

&quot;At least that&#39;s how we&#39;d do it!&quot; Maisoko said with unnerving glee.

&quot;To make matters worse, we cannot stay for much longer. Our mission has been completed and 
we must report the course to the Tsuchikage,&quot; Shiryu said, saddened. &quot;To think that there&#39;s 
a puppet master with much skill at making human puppets.&quot;

Momo looked at the other kunoichi, wandering to whom they were. Unfortunately, none seemed 
to be in the mood for making introductions.

&quot;Well at least we have the satisfaction of knowing she is hear. We just need to collect her 
head and return home,&quot; Nekomi said.

&quot;You say that as though you know where they are!&quot; Tenten said, concern in her voice.

&quot;We don&#39;t, but we know their target,&quot; Tachiko said. &quot;When they next attack, I will punish 
her for her crimes.&quot;

&quot;But to go up against them alone! That&#39;s suicide!&quot; Tenten exclaimed.

&quot;We don&#39;t intend too. As soon as we&#39;ve disposed of her body- which shouldn&#39;t all that hard, 
we will return to our village,&quot; Nekomi said.

&quot;What about the city?!&quot; Hinata asked. Her face ashen from the thought of the chaos.

&quot;That is not of our concern,&quot; Tachi said. &quot;We must rest and prepare for the next battle. If 
you wish to remain in good graces of your village, I suggest you complete your mission if 
you haven&#39;t already and leave.&quot; Turning about, she and Nekomi left the gathered kunoichi and 
returned to the inn.

&quot;I fear she speaks the truth my Konoha friends,&quot; Shiryu said. &quot;Though I hate to admit it, to 
stay in this land for any much longer will risk our positions.&quot;

As much as either Tenten or Hinata hated to admit it, they couldn&#39;t do anything.

---

&quot;I&#39;m in your debt,&quot; Barahime said to the gathered kunoichi. As to be expected Tachi and 
Nekomi were absent, excusing themselves inorder to rest. The young daimyo was ashen, the 
color having drained from her face and bags beginning to form under her eyes. She had lost 
sleep in the news of the attack and the grim news that the kunoichi brought them would make 
it getting sleep an impossible feat. &quot;If what you say is true, then we are doomed. Our 
milaitary is strong in their own right, but stand no chance against enemies of such calibur. 
We are better off surrendering if we thought it would spare our people.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t! Even if they were to offer to spare your people if you did, they&#39;ll just kill 
everyone after they&#39;ve got what they want!&quot; Tenten said heatedly. &quot;Anyone who would betray 
their own village can&#39;t be trusted!&quot;

&quot;I understand your concern, but we aren&#39;t fools,&quot; Sizume said. &quot;We know full well that 
criminals have no honor. Our warriors will fight valliantly to the death, after we&#39;ve 
successful evacuated the civilians!&quot;

&quot;Your warriors are practically immortal, but they will not stand much of a chance against 
the real enemy. You will also need to assigns guards to watch over the civilians and place 
to keep them. Amongst their numbers there seems to a few who enjoy killing a little too 
much. These few won&#39;t be satisfied to have captured a nearly abandoned city. They will track 
down the civilians and dispatch them for sure,&quot; Shiryu said, shaking her head.

&quot;And what do you suggest we do then?&quot; Barahime asked.

&quot;Pray for a miracle,&quot; Itamu answered.

---

&quot;Are you done yet?&quot; Panda asked.

&quot;For the umpteen thousandth time, no! It takes crucial time for me to lay everything in 
place. One little flaw and no one will believe my master pieces!&quot; the voice from the shadows 
snarled.

&quot;But I&#39;m bored!&quot; Panda said, moaning. &quot;There&#39;s nothing to do around here! Konoki and Yuki 
are being all lovey-dovey, Byoshi is napping, Kawaki is out swimming, Kouryu is moping 
about, wishing it would rain, I don&#39;t wanna know what Kuroki is up to, Kuchiki is eating, 
Inari is out pulling pranks and Mimi has disappeared!&quot;

&quot;Disappeared?&quot; the voice said, confused.

&quot;Yeah and she&#39;s been acting wierdly since the attack,&quot; Panda said. &quot;She sighs and touches 
her stomach... Do you think she could be pregnant?&quot;

&quot;No, that&#39;s not likely it. However this is troubling. She hails from Konoha after all. They 
are a bunch of pacifist fools and Mimi is no exception. I know little to why she defected in 
the first place, but I doubt she&#39;s suited for our grand plan. It is also possible that she 
is, in fact a spy, acting as a criminal in name only to infiltrate our organization and 
discover our secrets. In that situation, allowing her out of her sight is a fatal mistake. 
We must find Mimi at once and place her under close surveillance before it&#39;s too late. 
Gather Kawaki, Kouryu, and Kuchiki. You must find her at once!&quot; the voice said.

&quot;Hai!&quot; Panda said, soluting the darkness before performing a series of hand seals in 
disappearing into the shadows.

---

Tenten didn&#39;t want to leave. Not only did she fell at peace in this land, but she had to 
leave it soon in its time of need. She wished there was something she could do, but what? 
Unfortunately, there was no place for her to comtemplate this. Where ever she went, she was 
greeted by the joyous cheers of the civilians, inviting her to join in the celebration of 
protecting the city. If only they knew what awaited them, then they wouldn&#39;t be so cheerful. 
She knew full well she had no to say so much; it&#39;s better that they enjoy the little time 
they had rather than live in fear, anxiously awaiting the next attack.

Tenten hadn&#39;t realized she wandered out of the city&#39;s gates and into the wilderness until 
she ran into a tree. Surprised, she looked about. To her relief the city was still in sight, 
but oddly yet, she was more relieved to be outside of their walls. The quiet melody of 
nature had a calming effect on her soul. Almost all of her worries were fading away, though 
she realized this and tried to keep ahold of them. Against her best efforts, they slipped 
through her fingers and were gone. She knew they&#39;ll return once she returned to the city, 
but maybe that&#39;s a good thing.

How long was it since she last trained? She couldn&#39;t remember. Finding a place with plenty 
of area, she unattached the large scroll she wore on her back and laid it on the ground. 
Unrolling it, she summoned two tonfa and began to practice twirling them in her hands and 
striking at an invisible enemy. The physical exertion filled her body with a sort of ectasy 
known only by someone who trained from youth to fight fast, hard and relentlessly. Her 
movements were fluid like water, changing from attacks and blocks against an imaginary foe, 
striking at her enemy&#39;s most vital spots and watching for openings. Soon she was so wrapped 
up in her training that she tuned everything out.

&quot;It&#39;s not very wise for you to be out here alone,&quot; said a voice from the trees, catching the 
kunoichi off guard and dragging her back to reality.

&quot;Whose there?&quot; she asked, taking a defensive stance. She didn&#39;t recognize the voice. Though 
the speaker didn&#39;t attack her, she wasn&#39;t so foolish to think that was cause enough to let 
her guard down.

Mimi stepped out from behind a tree.

Tenten&#39;s attention was immediately drawn to the kunoichi&#39;s forehead protector. Though it 
meant the woman was an ally, Tenten had heard of no word from the village at dispatching 
additional shinobi nor there being any already in Kuni no Yuri. Something was suspicious. 
&quot;Who are you?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I am not an enemy,&quot; Mimi said, adding in her mind (at least not currently).

&quot;I like to believe that, but that still doesn&#39;t answer my question,&quot; Tenten said, looking 
sternly at the kunoichi.

&quot;Believe me or not, it doesn&#39;t matter. If it means anything, the fact I didn&#39;t take the 
chance to strike you down while you were distracted is proof enough of this. If you want to 
fight, feel free to make the first strike. I will not hesitate to defend myself,&quot; Mimi said 
dryly.

Tenten sighed. It was clear that she wouldn&#39;t get any answers from the woman. Still she 
couldn&#39;t drop her guard. &quot;What is your purpose here?&quot;

&quot;I... I don&#39;t know... My feet just took me here,&quot; the woman said looking at the ground.

&quot;So it must be destiny,&quot; Tenten said, looking at the woman sympathetically. She easily read 
that the woman was troubled by the sad dullness in her only eye.

&quot;Destiny?&quot; Mimi said, looking at the younger kunoichi in askance.

&quot;Our meeting today is destined. You said yourself that you are willing to fight so let&#39;s do 
that!&quot; Without warning Tenten lunged at the woman, swinging out with her tonfa.

Jumping away from the kunoichi&#39;s attack, Mimi landed on her hands and feet. Confused she 
looked at the girl who wasted no time in rushing after her. Gritting her teeth, she hissed 
&quot;Yurei Shakuhou: Kitsunetsuki!&quot; The whites of her eyes turned black as her iris glowed red. 
Her teeth became carnivorous fangs and her nails grew long and sharp. A dark aura, invisible 
to the naked eye, wrapped about the kunoichi.

Tenten stopped in mid strike, taken by surprise at the sudden transformation. Just looking 
at the transormed woman raised the hairs on the back of her neck. Not sure of what her enemy 
was capable of she dropped back. For her foresight she was rewarded with her life.

Mimi swipped her a clawed hand through the air where Tenten had been standing seconds before 
faster than the kunoichi&#39;s eye could follow. Snarling, the woman charged forward on her 
hands and feet.

Sidestepping her monstrous opponent, she threw a spinning strike at Mimi&#39;s back.

With a back-handed strike, the woman not only blocked the attack causing any harm to her, 
but shattered it a cloud of splinters. She followed through with a swipe of her other hand.

Blocking the slash with her remaining tonfa which exploded in splinters like the first, 
Tenten was thrown into a tree with tremendous force and had the wind knocked out of her.

This much strength; she couldn&#39;t possibly be human, the kunoichi thought as she tossed aside 
the handles of her tonfa (which happened to be all that remained) and grabbed her scroll. 
Summoning a kusarigama, she threw the weighted end, attempting to ensnare her opponent.

Mimi caught the chain in one hand and, with a simple tug, dragged Tenten off her feet and 
sent her flying towards her. With her free hand she socked Tenten in face with bone with 
enough strength cause the kunoichi&#39;s head to explode into a shower of splinters.

Having predicted that this may happen, Tenten had grabbed a section of log from the ground 
and replaced with her body using Kawarimi no Jutsu as she was janked off her feet. Using the 
momentum to launch her past her opponent, she released a barrage of shuriken, kunai, kama 
and about any other small and throwable weapon she kept stored within her scroll before 
landing on a tree branch.

Unable to react in time, Mimi was impaled by the weapons. Despite the hideous blow to her 
body, she stood seemingly unfazed. Taking a deep breath, she released a bestial roar causing 
the dark aura around her body to exploded from her body, sending the impaling weapons in all 
directions.

Tenten was forced to duck behind a tree in order to escape the random flight of expelled 
weapons. Jumping into the air, she began to spiral through the air at high speed striking 
the tree that Tenten was hiding behind and piercing it at tremendous force.

I...Isn&#39;t that an Inuzuka technique? Tenten wandered as she leaped from the tree at the last 
second. As she landed on the ground below, she leapt away in time to evade Mimi who 
continued her spiraling attack into the ground. Leaping diagnally into the air and bounding 
off a nearby tree, she evaded Mimi as she emerged from the ground.

Her spinning slowed and the woman drifted in the air as her momentum carried her upward. Her 
breathing was labored and blood trickle from her mouth. &quot;I guess this is our limit...&quot; As 
her sent reached it&#39;s peak, she began to fall to the ground. Her body returned to normal as 
the aura faded. Closing her eye, she prayed that her opponent would kill her mid air so that 
she wouldn&#39;t have to feel her bones shatter on the landing.

Tenten, landing atop a tree branch, leapt towards Mimi, catching her mid air and bounding 
from the tree to land safely on the ground. &quot;Hay... are you alright?&quot; She asked concerned.

&quot;Why should somebody who attacked out of the blue be suddenly asking me that?&quot; Mimi asked, 
opening her eye to look at the kunoichi.

&quot;Yes I attacked you, but I had no intention of killing you! You had such a haunted look in 
your eye, that I just wanted take your mind off whatever was bothering you!&quot; Tenten said 
angrily.

&quot;So impaling me with those shuriken and kuni is your idea of trying to not kill me?&quot; Mimi 
said, confused.

&quot;I thought you&#39;d dodge! Besides, you were the one trying to kill me!&quot; Tenten returned.

&quot;Trying to solve your problems with violence. You&#39;re either a Kiri spy or a student of Might 
Guy,&quot; Mimi said, sighing.

Tenten blushed in embarrassment. I guess I did act rashly, she thought with disdain. 
&quot;Anyways what the hell was that back there? It was like you were possessed or something!&quot;

&quot;Or something...&quot; Mimi said, reluctantly to truthfully answer her opponent&#39;s question. 
Pushing herself out of the kunoichi&#39;s arms, she tried to walk away, stumbling and falling to 
a tree. &quot;I guess I should thank you for trying to help me, but this is a manner that 
involves you.&quot;

&quot;Maybe not, but it&#39;s probably better to get it off your chest,&quot; Tenten said.

&quot;If you are one of his students, then I suppose you won&#39;t stop hounding on this,&quot; Mimi said, 
sighing. &quot;I fear I have done something to hurt the memory of somebody close to me and I 
don&#39;t know what do...&quot;

&quot;You should ask for forgiveness as soon as possible. If that person truly loved, then you&#39;ll 
be forgiven,&quot; Tenten said.

&quot;But what if I don&#39;t deserve forgiveness?&quot; Mimi asked. &quot;What if I had done something so bad, 
that she can never forgive me?&quot;

&quot;Everybody deserves to be forgiven! She understands what you&#39;ve done and is more than 
willing to forgive you!&quot; Tenten said.

&quot;What if I betray her memory her memory by sealing her soul into my body and corrupting her 
soul by killing innocents!&quot; Mimi said, looking at the kunoichi in concern.

&quot;I...I...&quot; Tenten hadn&#39;t expected to hear this. She had heard of such feats being possible, 
but she never expected someone to be so willing to do it to themself. She was baffled and a 
bit frightened, however, she could see the guilt and self-loathing the woman&#39;s eye. &quot;I think 
you should make right your mistakes and purify your body, the vessel her spirit is 
imprissoned in. If you do this, she may not forgive you, but that is her rite. However, no 
matter how badly you treat somebody, as long as they love, she&#39;ll forgive you!&quot;

Tears fell from Mimi&#39;s eye. &quot;Thank you,&quot; the woman said, clutching her stomach. Whipping the 
tears away she looked at the younger kunoichi. &quot;May I offer you some advice?&quot;

&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Tenten said.

&quot;Leave this country now. You will not stand a chance against us, in our next attack,&quot; Mimi 
said. Peforming the ram hand seal, a shroud of wind blown leaves spiralled about her body 
before landing on the ground. However, as soon as they landed, she had disappeared.

&quot;Tenten-san!&quot; Hinata yelled, running to the kunoichi at full speed.

&quot;Hinata?&quot; Tenten asked in surprise.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t find and some people said they saw you leave the city in a daze. I was worried 
so I searched for with my Byakugan. I saw an enormous surge of chakra and I was worried you 
were in danger,&quot; Hinata said, her face pale with fear.

&quot;You were worried for me?&quot; Tenten asked. She couldn&#39;t explain why her heart beat quickened, 
why her cheeks burned with blush or even why hearing that from the Hyuga caused her to feel 
warm inside. Somewhere in the back of her mind, she wandered if this could be love. She felt 
ashamed for causing her own team mate to worry over her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; she said sheepishly.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Hinata asked.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Tenten said. &quot;I think I met one of the people who attacked last night, but I 
don&#39;t think she wants to hurt anybody- at least not anymore.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Hinata asked, not understanding what she meant.

&quot;I&#39;ll explain on the way back,&quot; Tenten said. She collected her scattered weapons and sealed 
them into the scroll.

---

&quot;Tsunade-sama! A message marked urgent has come from Yuri no Kuni!&quot; Shizune said, bursting 
into the Hokage&#39;s office. She quickly hurried over to the Hokage&#39;s desk and handed a scroll 
she had been carrying.

&quot;From Yuri no Kuni?&quot; Tsunade asked, surprised. Taking the scroll and unrolling, she read the 
missive. The expression on her face grew grim. &quot;Shinobi has attacked their capital and 
they&#39;ve asked Tenten and Hinata to stay behind. Also they want us to send reinforcements. 
They&#39;re willing to pay any price aslong as the shinobi been driven out of their land... A 
mission of this level would be atleast A ranked. Shizune, gather as many Jonin ranked 
kunoichi you can find and bring them to my office at once!&quot;

&quot;Yes, Tsuande-sama!&quot; Shizune said, rushing out of the Hokage&#39;s office.

---

&quot;You summoned us, Kazekage-sama?&quot; Asked Matsuri as she and Sari followed Temari into the 
Mizukage&#39;s office.

&quot;We&#39;ve received an emergency request from Yuri no Kuni for urgent assistance,&quot; Gaara said as 
he looked up from the scroll on his desk.

&quot;Yuri no Kuni?&quot; Matsuri asked.

&quot;I&#39;ve only heard rumors of the country, but from what I understand, it&#39;s a neutral country 
that lends safe harbor to any woman that has been brutalized by men though many women come 
for vocational visits,&quot; Temari said. &quot;As a peaceful country, it&#39;s military is still 
inexperienced and they have no shinobi villages to rely on.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t that also the country where can seek lesbian relationships?&quot; Sari asked.

&quot;Er, yes... but that&#39;s not important,&quot; Temari said, blushing.

&quot;It seems they have a pair of Konoha and Iwa kunoichi already at the capital from a previous 
mission whom they&#39;ve requested to remain behind and help them. Your mission is to lend them 
aid in the defense,&quot; Gaara said.

&quot;Then why did they come to us for help?&quot; Matsuri asked.

&quot;In the last attack by the enemy, they fought life like human puppets. It&#39;s believed that 
one of the enemy is a rogue follower of Sasori of the Red Sands,&quot; Gaara stated.

&quot;Are you saying that the Akatsuki&#39;s behind this?&quot; Temari asked, her face pale.

&quot;From the descriptions of the known enemy, none have identified as being members of 
Akatsuki. It is likely that when Sasori was defeated, his followers were scattered to the 
wind in fear of being discovered by our ANBU. We also bear a great debt to Konoha. In order 
to repay this debt and as to take responsibility for our own mistake, you shall locate and, 
if necessary, dispose of the enemies threatening Yuri no Kuni,&quot; Gaara said.

&quot;Yes sir!&quot; The kunoichi said in unison before departing to pack and leave the village.

---

&quot;Reinforcements? I&#39;ve already sent out that sappy Momo so she can make-up to the Hitsugis. I 
think that&#39;s enough,&quot; the Tsuchikage said as he read the request from Yuri no Kuni.

&quot;You sure you can really on? There&#39;s no doubt that the Hitsugi&#39;s are an army of their own, 
but I&#39;ve known rocks brighter than Momo,&quot; Kurotsuchi asked.

&quot;Momo may be as blunt as a rock and hopeless when caught in genjutsu, but none can match her 
lust for battle,&quot; the old said smiling. &quot;Besides, if she dies, that&#39;s one less anoying brat 
I have to worry about.&quot;

Kurotsuchi laughed nervously while thinking, is that how he thinks of her?

---

&quot;Konoha, we&#39;ve been looking for you,&quot; Itamu said as Tenten and Hinata returned to the city. 
&quot;We&#39;ve received word from our respective villages. It seems that our leaders have decided to 
help and has ordered us to remain in the capital. They have shall be sending reinforcements 
and have asked the other villages for support.&quot;

&quot;What? But that&#39;s impossible! I doubt the fastest birds in the world could cover that much 
land by now!&quot; Tenten said confused.

&quot;You&#39;re correct in that. Another thing that troubles me is that our Tsuchikage is too proud 
to ask help from other villages. Somebody&#39;s been trying to manipulate us,&quot; the Iwa kunoichi.

&quot;Could it be the enemy?&quot; Hinata asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so. Unless there&#39;s a spy amongst us, it&#39;s unlikely they know that we were 
leaving and even if we did, they&#39;d wait for us to leave so that they could the capital more 
easily,&quot; Itamu said.

&quot;I agree. I just fought one of the enemy&#39;s, though I was the one who initiated the battle. 
She had asked us to leave if we wanted to live. Though she could be trying to trick us, I 
don&#39;t think so... She seemed like she was regretting her actions,&quot; Tenten said, looking 
away.

&quot;Even if she was coerced into it, she still conspired with her allies to take the lives of 
innocents and take a country by force. Regardless of what she feels, we cannot allow her to 
go unpunished. I understand that Konoha has been lenient on it&#39;s nukenin, but in war 
pittying the enemy will get yourself killed. As of current, Shiryu is trying to confirm the 
Tsuchikage&#39;s real orders and locate the one responsible for sending us this bogus missive. I 
suggest you do the same,&quot; Itamu said promptly before turning and walking away.

&quot;Itamu... you&#39;re a medical nin right? What do you know of fuinjutus?&quot; Tenten asked.

&quot;I may know a thing or two, but what do you want to know?&quot; Itamu said, stopping and looking 
at the kunoichi.

&quot;She claimed to have dishonored a memory of a loved sealing their sole into her... and 
during our battle, she perfomed some weird technique that gave her immense strength. I think 
it was called &#39;Kitsunetsuki&#39;,&quot; Tenten said trying to remember the battle she had fought a 
little while ago.

&quot;So they are practicing that forbidden technique...&quot; Itamu said, walking off. Yurei Kinko... 
Monster Imprisonment... An art only practiced by kuromiko.

Tenten tried to get more information from Itamu, but was hopeless. With nothing better to 
do, she and Hinata decided to follow her advice and look into their mysterious orders.

None noticed the suspicious on looke sidle away, muttering &quot;That Iwa kunochi is particularly 
sharp, but I&#39;ve done all I can to help them,&quot; under her breath. Looking to her feet where a 
small shelty stood she added, &quot;Come Kotsuzui; we should stop that stray dog from getting 
herself killed. Masters don&#39;t like it when their dogs bite the hand that feeds them, even 
those masters incourage them to kill others.&quot;

Barking the dog as it followed her.
