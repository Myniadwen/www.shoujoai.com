<h1>Practice Makes Perfect (part 11 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../naruto/index.html">Naruto</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nighinvis.html">nighinvisible</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../naruto/pracperfect-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Running her fingers through her hair, Ino knew it was time to get out of 
the shower. It was her fourth shower that evening, but regardless of the 
fact that it had not even been her body, Ino couldn&#39;t feel clean of 
Sasuke. She was also drowning in a tidal wave of emotions and the water 
was not washing away the feelings that were assaulting her.

What had she been thinking, agreeing to Sakura&#39;s plan? As she rinsed the 
shampoo out of her already clean hair, Ino raged at herself for 
participating in such a scheme. She had not only witnessed, but also 
completely invaded somebody else&#39;s intimate moment. If Sasuke were to 
ever find out...

Sasuke could never, ever find out.

There was nothing left for her to clean. Her skin was dry and itchy from 
being scrubbed so many times, red and raw under her fingertips. The 
water was turning cold but still Ino stayed in the shower. Slowly, she 
sank into the tub, sitting down under the jet from the showerhead. Ino 
closed her eyes and looked up, allowing the icy water to soothe her 
face, which she now realized was slightly swollen.

She had been crying. Upon that realization, Ino broke down, tears she 
did not know she had bursting forth, her sobs racking her throat.

Many years before, when her father was teaching her the family&#39;s jutsu, 
he had warned her of the emotional impact of it. He told her that when 
entering someone&#39;s mind, taking control of it, it was impossible not to 
become at least slightly attached to the person. See, it was impossible 
to experience something so completely intimate and not walk away with 
some sense of yearning, either to protect, love or hurt the mind that 
had been intruded on.

Ino had not remembered that warning until now, because she had never 
before been so intimately connected with another mind. Not only had she 
intruded upon Sakura&#39;s mind...she had purposefully shared her thoughts, 
her emotions with the other girl. And Sakura&#39;s own fear and anticipation 
had intertwined with Ino&#39;s, twisting and connecting until Ino wasn&#39;t 
sure anymore what had been her own.

Turning off the water, Ino crawled out of the tub, shivering. Pushing 
her emotions down, she wrapped a towel around her and prepared to talk 
to the girl she had just been inside.

- - - - - - - -

The two girls sat at Sakura&#39;s kitchen table, mugs of tea in their hands. 
Both were weary from Ino&#39;s jutsu and the encounter with Sasuke.

&quot;So what am I doing wrong, Ino?&quot;

&quot;You idiot, you aren&#39;t doing anything wrong. That worthless bastard 
Uchiha has no idea at all what he is doing.&quot;

Sakura&#39;s face dropped in disappointment.

&quot;So...will it never get better?&quot;

No. It will never get better. He will never be able to love you the way 
you deserve to be loved. Ino wanted to say it, she wanted to so badly, 
but seeing the misery in her friend&#39;s face halted her blunt words and 
she found herself saying something she did not feel at all.

&quot;It could get better, but it will take some work on your part, Sakura.&quot;

&quot;Like what?&quot;

&quot;Remember how I got on top? Switching things up might help so he isn&#39;t 
just crushing you.&quot;

&quot;...Ok. But...eh...I don&#39;t know that many positions.&quot;

Ino wanted to bang her head on the table. Sakura might be a good friend, 
but at the moment Ino was overwhelmed by Sakura&#39;s naivet&eacute;.

&quot;Sakura...do you know anything?&quot;

Instead of getting red as she normally did, Sakura surprised Ino with a 
big smile and a laugh.

&quot;It seems I don&#39;t! So, Ino-Sensei, when does my tutelage begin?&quot;

- - - - -

It may have been a joke, but Sakura&#39;s question proved to be true&#151;over 
the next few weeks; Ino began to tutor her friend in the ways of mating. 
Ino found herself enjoying the teaching more and more as time 
progressed, and Sakura was a quick learner.

Sitting on Ino&#39;s bed, the two girls were looking at a book of positions. 
Sakura&#39;s face was scrunched up as she tried to understand the physics of 
the bodies.

&quot;Ino, I just don&#39;t understand how this would work. And if it did work, 
how could it possibly be pleasurable.&quot;

Ino sighed. Shifting, she pulled her pink haired friend onto to bed, 
flipping her so that she was facedown.

&quot;Ino, what in the hell are you doing?&quot;

But the blond had already grabbed Sakura&#39;s hips, pulling them into the 
air. With a couple of deft twists, and a lifting of Sakura&#39;s leg, Ino 
positioned her crotch next to Sakura&#39;s.

&quot;See? He would penetrate you like this. This wasn&#39;t so difficult, was 
it? And part of getting off is the thrill of doing something kinky.&quot;

But Sakura wasn&#39;t listening to Ino. All she was aware of was how little 
control she had in this position. She tried to imagine Sasuke behind 
her, holding her and fucking her while she couldn&#39;t do anything, 
helpless. But Sasuke&#39;s face kept becoming fuzzy and instead she kept 
feeling Ino, there. Ino&#39;s hand on the curve of her hip, the other one 
securing her leg. Ino&#39;s hips...right there.

Ino began to thrust her hips, mocking the motion the male would do in 
the position.

&quot;Oi! Are you even listening, dobe?&quot; Dropping her friend onto the bed, 
Ino sat back and was surprised when Sakura sat up flushed, her breathing 
a little ragged.

Ino raised an eyebrow, a smirk on her face.

&quot;I think you might be getting ahead of yourself there, Wide forehead. 
I&#39;m not your boy toy.&quot;

Sakura blushed. She wasn&#39;t sure why she was so turned on, Ino had 
just...

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, you just caught me off guard. I wasn&#39;t...wasn&#39;t expecting a 
demonstration.&quot;

&quot;If you paid more attention, I wouldn&#39;t need to demonstrate.&quot;

The two girls kept laughing throughout the afternoon, but Sakura 
couldn&#39;t shake the memory of what Ino&#39;s hand had felt like on her body.

For that matter, Ino couldn&#39;t shake the memory, either.

- - - - - - -

Sasuke lay beside here, chest heaving in the aftermath of sex. She had 
talked to him about jumping up and leaving right after, and he had 
listened and stayed for a while now.

But that was all he seemed to have heard.

Sure, they switched things up. And he did try to slow down and let her 
set the pace. With all the things he was doing to improve, Sakura felt 
herself sinking into depression because her response wasn&#39;t there.

When he touched her....she felt nothing. When he was in her, she hated 
to admit it, but he felt like a nuisance instead of her lover.

The week before Ino had laughingly told her that there was no more to be 
taught. That had crushed the pink-haired girl. She had enjoyed learning 
from her friend, who seemed so wise about sex. Ino knew how to touch 
her. As much as Sakura tried to teach Sasuke, his hands were so much 
rougher, so unskilled compared to Ino&#39;s.

Sakura realized that she was running out of time. With all of the 
interest she had shown Sasuke in the bedroom...it seemed to make him 
more and more interested in her. It was strange, to have him actually 
call her. Or say nice things. Or do things for her, like pick her 
flowers, or cook her dinner.

In fact, as Uchiha Sasuke slowly became the boyfriend she had always 
wanted, Sakura found herself desiring him less and less. And she hated 
herself for it.

If he was going to change for her...she needed to keep trying. But after 
that night&#39;s sex, where once again, Sasuke came in her too soon and left 
her feeling empty and numb, Sakura wanted to scream. She wanted to rant 
and rave. She wanted her friend there.

She wanted Ino.

- - - - - -

&quot;No. I can&#39;t do that. Not again.&quot;

Ino&#39;s eyes were wide and her face had paled. It was not the reaction 
Sakura had been hoping for.

&quot;Please, Ino. I&#39;ve done everything we&#39;ve talked about, and it isn&#39;t 
getting better. Just one more time. If you find something that can get 
better, then I can try it.&quot;

&quot;Sakura, what if there isn&#39;t anything else you can try?&quot;

Big green eyes met clear blue ones, the answer passing through them. If 
not...then the relationship would be over. Ino nodded, she understood.

&quot;I don&#39;t feel right about it though, Sakura. I should never have done it 
the last time. It is such an invasion of your privacy, and I know you 
don&#39;t like me being in there, and&#151;&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t mind. I mean...it wasn&#39;t so bad that time, with you in my 
mind.&quot;

Ino stared at her friend. The air in the room was filled with her 
apprehension. But Sakura&#39;s face was pleading with her. More importantly, 
Ino found herself wanting to try it again, wanting to be inside of 
Sakura again. Hell, now that she was completely over her Sasuke 
infatuation, she could teach the boy a thing or two (or a million) about 
fucking.

And...

Ino was lonely. While she enjoyed teaching Sakura, it had only made Ino 
more aware of the emptiness of her bed, of Chouji&#39;s absence. Many nights 
she found herself longing for someone&#39;s touch, for the feeling of a 
lover and warmth in her bed. Selfishly, Ino found herself wanting to try 
again with Sakura so that she could simply be with someone.

&quot;Ok. I&#39;ll do it. But god, Sakura, if we get caught...&quot;

&quot;We won&#39;t. We are a team!&quot; Sakura winked, but Ino found herself 
worrying, just a little.

- - - - -

(Again, lemon coming up, skip when you start to feel uncomfortable.)

- - - - -

&quot;Sakura, wear prettier lingerie. If I am going to be in that body, it 
should be dressed up a bit more.&quot;

&quot;Ok then, but what should I wear? You pick it out.&quot;

Ino began sorting through Sakura&#39;s underwear. Ever since Sakura had 
started dating, her collection of underwear had grown slightly 
naughtier. Then Ino saw it&#151;the perfect set. The bra and panties were cut 
in a normal way, nothing too frilly or fussy. But the fabric was pure 
silk, not a mix. It floated through her fingers, smooth and delicious. 
They were dark green, not Ino&#39;s color but she knew it would look pretty 
on Sakura&#39;s skin and contrast well with her hair.

&quot;These.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll put them on&#151;turn your back.&quot;

Ino laughed and turned around. &quot;It is silly, I&#39;m going to be in your 
naked body later, I already know what you look like.&quot;

&quot;Yes...but still...I would feel strange, I think, if you watched.&quot; 
Sakura&#39;s voice had a slight huskiness to it, and Ino couldn&#39;t tell if 
she had upset her friend or not, so she let it drop.

&quot;So everything is ready?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Ino, are you sure? I realize I kind of pressured you into this when you 
didn&#39;t want to. If you want to back out, I would understand.&quot;

But Ino was already securing herself inside of the closet.

- - - - -

It had been easier to enter Sakura&#39;s mind this time. The girls had 
practiced and, knowing what it was going to be like, Sakura had already 
suppressed herself before Ino was even there, making the transition 
flawless.

Sasuke had her pushed against the wall and was kissing her neck, his 
body grinding into hers. It was true, he had at least learned to take 
his time a little. Ino was having trouble relaxing though. She kept 
expecting him to mess up. Lifting one of Sakura&#39;s legs, Ino wrapped it 
around Sasuke, drawing him closer. She could feel his cock through his 
clothes, pushing into her. Sasuke moaned, deep and throaty.

His hand moved under her shirt. It was gentler this time, but still 
clumsy as he grabbed her breasts, squeezing them. Ino had to fight the 
urge to smack his hand away.

Sasuke grabbed her hips and moved her to the bed, pulling her shirt off 
as they went.

Oh god, here we go.

And then Ino found herself on her back. Sasuke had maneuvered her onto 
the bed in one sift motion, and then he was in between her legs, 
grinding softly against her.

&quot;So, uh, does he think dry humping is foreplay?&quot;

Ino could hear Sakura laughing. &quot;Yeah, pretty much.&quot; As the laughter 
continued, Ino became startled. She could feel it now, in every nerve of 
the body she shared with her friend. Sakura was not only comfortable 
with Ino being in her mind...she was enjoying it.

&quot;Sakura, is something wrong?&quot; Ino looked up into Sasuke&#39;s luminous eyes. 
It was difficult, bouncing between Sakura and Sasuke. She tried to focus 
on him again.

&quot;Yes. Everything is...wonderful. Don&#39;t...don&#39;t stop.&quot; It had been a 
struggle to say the lies and Ino hoped she had sounded convincing.

Sasuke seemed to be convinced, because he began to undress her.

&quot;Sasuke...leave my underwear on for a bit.&quot;

He looked at her questioningly, but as he pulled off her pants and saw 
the green silk against her milky skin, a smirk played across his lips.

&quot;You...you haven&#39;t worn nice underwear in a while. You look amazing.&quot; 
His voice was rasping, full of desire as his eyes roamed over her body.

&quot;You haven&#39;t been wearing nice underwear?&quot;

She could feel Sakura&#39;s frustration, but Ino couldn&#39;t believe it.

&quot;Well, he was rushing all time anyway, I didn&#39;t see the point in 
dressing up if he wasn&#39;t even going to look.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s looking now, Sakura.&quot;

Ino looked down, admiring with him. The last time everything had gone so 
quickly she had not had a chance to really look at the body she was 
controlling. Ino had to admit that Sasuke was right&#151;Sakura did look 
amazing. Her body wasn&#39;t as toned as most other female shinobi&#151;due in 
part to all of her medical training instead of combat training. Her skin 
was flawless and pale, and Ino had been right about the underwear, for 
it made Sakura almost glow. Ino saw incredible breasts and a flat 
stomach.

&quot;Damn, Sakura, you have a sweet body!&quot;

&quot;Ino pig, don&#39;t you dare! Stop looking at me&#151;it is weird&#151;and get back to 
teaching me!&quot;

After one last glance, Ino became focused again. If Sasuke did not know 
how to pleasure her, maybe he would be more interested after she showed 
him pleasure. Ino reached Sakura&#39;s hand out and grabbed Sasuke&#39;s cock. 
He shuddered and moaned, putting a hand on the wall beside of him.

&quot;Sakura, what&#151;&quot; but his voice caught in his throat, cutting him off, as 
Ino took him into Sakura&#39;s mouth.

&quot;Ino, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!&quot;

&quot;Shut up, watch and learn, Sakura.&quot;

Ino began to move Sakura&#39;s lips around the head, her tongue swirling out 
over the swollen purple flesh. She then ran Sakura&#39;s tongue down the 
underside of his shaft, causing Sasuke to cry out. His thighs began to 
tremble a little as Ino continued to work his cock with Sakura&#39;s mouth, 
changing tempos. When he began to buck his hips a little, Ino pulled 
back. A whine escaped Sasuke&#39;s mouth, but Ino just winked at him. 
Licking her two hands to get them well lubricated, she grabbed him with 
both of Sakura&#39;s hands. She began to twist up and around on his cock&#151;but 
she twisted her hands in opposite directions. The hand that she had 
around his tip twisted quicker and lighter, squeezing until Sasuke was 
gasping and moaning, his whole body twitching.

&quot;S-Sakura, please. Please, stop, I want to cum in you.&quot;

Ino smiled with satisfaction. She could feel the awe of Sakura.

&quot;I&#39;ve never done that before! That was amazing! He has never reacted 
that way.&quot;

&quot;Sometimes you have to give a little in order to receive.&quot;

As Sasuke lay on the bed to recover, Ino took the underwear off Sakura&#39;s 
body. She crawled on top of Sasuke and lowered Sakura onto his cock. He 
made to grab her hips, but Ino caught his hands in hers, and pinned his 
wrists to either side of his head.

&quot;Sorry, Uchiha, but I&#39;m in control. Be a good boy, ok?&quot;

Sasuke stared at her, his eyes wide, but he didn&#39;t move his hands. 
Keeping him pinned and ignoring his looks, Ino began to rock Sakura&#39;s 
body on him. She could feel him hard, filling Sakura, and she rotated 
Sakura&#39;s hips, trying to find the spot. When she found it, she sat up. 
Sasuke left his hands beside his head.

&quot;Ok, so feel this?&quot;

&quot;Yes. It feels like...like I have to pee.&quot;

Ino wanted to laugh, but she caught herself in time.

&quot;Yeah, it feel like that now, but just wait.&quot;

Ino began to rock a little more on him, so that his cock began to stroke 
the spot inside of Sakura. She moaned&#151;it might be Sakura&#39;s body, but Ino 
felt it as well. It had been too long since she had felt this with 
Chouji being away, and she had forgotten how good it felt to be 
connected to another person.

This was different, too, than being with Chouji. Ino found herself 
becoming very turned on, sensing Sakura there. She liked this complete 
control over someone else&#39;s body, making someone else experience 
pleasure...pleasure she was sharing. The eroticism of the situation was 
sweeping over Ino. She felt Sakura&#39;s skin begin to flush and her heart 
speed up.

&quot;Wait, Ino, I&#39;ve never felt this before. What are you doing? Tell me so 
I can do it next time!&quot;

Ino didn&#39;t hear Sakura. She was already lost in her own pleasure. 
Reaching hands up, Ino began to stroke Sakura&#39;s breasts. Ino was shocked 
to feel how different Sakura&#39;s breasts were from her own. Sakura&#39;s were 
softer, and more sensitive to touch. Ino squeezed them and traced her 
fingers around them, enjoying the sensations Sakura&#39;s body was feeling. 
When she pinched Sakura&#39;s nipples, she felt Sakura&#39;s cunt tingle and 
squeeze down on Sasuke&#39;s cock. Ino began to rock her friend&#39;s body 
harder, bearing down on the dick that was inside of her. Feeling 
Sakura&#39;s crotch begin to tingle, Ino dropped one hand down and used her 
fingers to find Sakura&#39;s clit.

Waves of pleasure racked through Sakura&#39;s body as Ino began to swirl her 
fingers around the sensitive nub.

Ino could hear Sakura&#39;s personality moaning, could feel the doubling 
sense of pleasure as both she and Sakura began to build their climax. It 
was unlike any orgasm Ino had ever experienced. Sharing the pleasure 
with Sakura didn&#39;t diminish it&#151;it multiplied it until Ino couldn&#39;t tell 
what part of the pleasure was hers and what was Sakura&#39;s, the emotions 
had commingled. Ino couldn&#39;t tell if she enjoyed the pleasure Sakura was 
feeling or if it was that she, Ino, was giving Sakura the pleasure. 
Ino&#39;s fingers curiously felt at her friend&#39;s clit, rubbing it in ways 
different from how she touched herself. Ino could feel Sakura&#39;s 
personality moaning, moving, throbbing with the enjoyment she was giving 
to the both of them.

Ino began to slam Sakura&#39;s body down on Sasuke, her eyes shut, one hand 
still grabbing Sakura&#39;s breasts while the other hand furiously rubbed 
Sakura&#39;s clit, the pressure building until finally, Sakura and Ino 
climaxed, Ino&#39;s throaty moan giving voice to the waves of pleasure they 
both felt.

As the orgasm subsided, Ino opened her eyes and looked down. Sasuke&#39;s 
face was a mix of shock and awe. She became aware of her situation 
again, of the fact that she was still posing as Sakura, and the fact 
that he was still hard inside of her friend.

&quot;Sakura...why haven&#39;t you done this before? I...I had no idea.&quot;

Ino tried to bite of the rage she felt at that, but couldn&#39;t quite keep 
it in. &quot;If you had taken any time with me, you would have known.&quot;

Sasuke looked away, trying not to show the hurt her words caused him.

&quot;Ino! Fix this now or so help me, I am kicking you out of my head!&quot; 
Sakura still sounded fatigued from the orgasm, but her threat was 
serious.

Ino grudgingly moved Sakura&#39;s hand out to touch Sasuke&#39;s face. His skin 
was smooth under the fingertips, and Ino traced the outlines of his jaw 
and eyebrows until he looked back at her.

&quot;I&#39;m...sorry, Sasuke. I didn&#39;t mean it the way it sounded. Forgive me?&quot;

Sasuke nodded, slowly.

&quot;Ok. You are... you are different tonight, Sakura. Something isn&#39;t the 
same in you.&quot;

Ino panicked. How could he know? Stay cool Ino, stay cool.

&quot;Ino...I&#39;m warning you. He can&#39;t figure out what is going on. Who knows 
what he would do?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about...I just wanted to show you 
that there are different ways of pleasure...that&#39;s all.&quot;

Sasuke didn&#39;t look wholly convinced, but he nodded. And then he sat up, 
grabbing her hips and pulling her off of him. Throwing Sakura/Ino 
stomach first over the side of the bed, he grabbed her wrists and pinned 
her down, pushing himself into her.

Ino grunted at the penetration, and she could feel Sakura sigh.

&quot;Here he goes again...&quot; Ino could hear the disappointment in her 
friend&#39;s voice.

&quot;Hey...at least you got yours, right?&quot;

Ino could feel Sakura&#39;s personality growing warm. It was strange to 
actually be able to feel everything her friend was feeling.

&quot;Yes, Ino. Thank you. I&#39;ve...never felt anything like that before.&quot;

Ino just gently accepted Sakura&#39;s thanks while trying to numb her own 
thoughts, Sasuke fucking himself behind her/Sakura to his own climax, 
finally collapsing on Sakura&#39;s back.</pre>
