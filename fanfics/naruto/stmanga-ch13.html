<h1>St Manga School (part 13 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../naruto/index.html">Naruto</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../naruto/stmanga-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>&quot;How do I look?&quot; Hinata asked Hilary, Mariah and Misty in a rather timid 
and shaky manner as she stared into the bathroom mirror in a short navy 
blue denim skirt and strapless top. These weren&#39;t the clothes that 
Hinata was used to wearing. She never really worn anything so revealing. 
The emerald green high heels were quite strange to stand on as she 
looked in the mirror and saw her face touched up by make-up. Although 
Hinata thought she looked much better than she usually looked, she was 
still nervous about her looks and had no idea if Naruto would even 
recognize her?

&quot;You look amazing!&quot; Mariah praised as she flicked the sapphire haired 
girl&#39;s hair. &quot;He should better have noticed you, Hilary you&#39;ve defiantly 
done a good job on Hinata&#39;s new look!&quot;

&quot;I doubt it,&quot; Emily added honestly. &quot;Naruto is as dense as a brick. 
Well. At least he&#39;s not as stupid as Ash Ketchum.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re both as stupid as each other,&quot; Hilary added as walked out the 
bathroom as the rest of the girls followed her. Hinata was struggling to 
keep up as she almost fell over once again, she tried holding onto the 
wall for the walking support. Mariah quickly ran over as helped Hinata 
stand up properly.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Hinata,&quot; Mariah said. &quot;Perhaps you need flat shoes instead 
of high heels. You should get used to them eventually.&quot; Hinata started 
walking again rather slowly as she felt the weight from her heels drag 
her down and slow her down quickly. She was grateful that Mariah was 
willing to help her walk around and if she fell over, she would help 
her. &quot;Anyway we have next lesson with Kimura, we better watch out for 
him. He&#39;s a total pervert at school, he is a nice man though.&quot;

As they walked into their class, Mr. Kimura stared at Hinata she walked 
into the class. He stared at her in amazement, this was the reason he 
liked high school girls so much, they were so young, innocent and 
pretty. He smiled as Hinata walked past by.

&quot;So we have a new student again?&quot; Ash asked as failed to recognize it 
was actually Hinata with a make over. &quot;Where is Hinata anyway?&quot;

&quot;THAT IS HINATA YOU DUMBASS!&quot; Naruto shouted as he obviously sounded 
annoyed about Ash&#39;s stupidity. &quot;You look really hot today Hinata!&quot; He 
told the bluenette as she quickly became red. She sat next to Naruto as 
Mariah, Emily and Hilary sat around her.

&quot;Hi Tima,&quot; Mariah said as she winked at dark haired girl named Tima.

&quot;Hi,&quot; Tima replied waving at Maria. Tima was practically the mother of 
the class, she was very wise and pretty intelligent. She was dating 
Chizuru, a girl with red hair who was most probably the biggest lesbian 
in the school; which made Tima love her, none of this &#39;men let me down, 
so I go for girls&#39; or &#39;just wanna try it on&#39; or any of that rubbish. She 
was a lesbian, a simple and clean lesbian. Although Chizuru flirted with 
Orihime and Tatsuki constantly, Tima wasn&#39;t fussed at all. Tima was the 
laid back person who also loved girls.

&quot;Finally,&quot; Tima chuckled to Sakura. &quot;Your dating someone decent, and not 
that emo Sasuke, I hated you two as a couple!&quot; Tima was referring to 
Sakura&#39;s girlfriend, Ino. &quot;You and him should fucking die if you two 
ever get back together!&quot;

&quot;LESBIANS!&quot; Kimura shouted as he widely opened his mouth pointing at 
Sakura and Ino. The blonde stared at the slightly perverted teacher with 
a disgusted look. Most of the class ad nw knew that they had already 
started going out, and it&#39;s only been a day. It wouldn&#39;t be so long, 
before the whole school knew, they were an item. She looked at Sakura as 
she realized, she was just as nervous as she was right now. Since Sakura 
was carrying a young child inside her, and wasn&#39;t sure who the father 
was at all, Ino felt she had a huge responsibility on her hands.

&quot;Is it true your pregnant, Sakura?&quot; Ash asked the pink haired girl 
curiously. &quot;May said, that Dawn said, that Zoey said, that Chisato said, 
that Yukari said, that Hisae said, that Shyst said, that Cho said, that 
Luna said, that Chiyo said that you were pregnant!&quot;

&quot;Well, one or more of them are spreading rumors around&quot; Ino snapped at 
Ash, who was known for his dense behavior. &quot;So leave Sakura alone, she&#39;s 
just had to get over Sasuke and Itachi being jerks, she doesn&#39;t you 
being one either!&quot;

&quot;Hey I was only asking a question!&quot; Ash stated in a change of tone. He 
quickly whispered to May, &quot;maybe the sex was bad after all.&quot; Sakura 
yelled as she threw herself on Ash&#39;s desk with a face full of anger and 
livid behavior.

&quot;YOU DON&#39;T EVEN KNOW WHAT SEX IS!&quot; Sakura screeched as she had her arms 
out ready to strangle him.

&quot;Yes I do,&quot; Ash replied trying to push the angry girl away from him. 
&quot;It&#39;s where the penis thrusts the vagina!&quot;

&quot;Ash finally knows what a penis is!&quot; Naruto praised as he remembered Ash 
not knowing what a penis was before, and always said &quot;Virginia&quot; instead 
of &quot;vagina.&quot;

&quot;YOU STAY OUT OF THIS NARUTO!&quot; Sakura screamed a Naruto as she 
frightened by the fact that Ash Ketchum, one of the dumbest kids in the 
class found out she was pregnant due to gossip. &quot;As for you Ash, weather 
I&#39;m pregnant or not has nothing to do with you!&quot;

&quot;You apologize to him right now!&quot; May ordered, furious by the way Ash 
was handled by Sakura. &quot;At least when he does it, he has the decency to 
use contraception.&quot;

&quot;What the hell is that?&quot; Ash asked in a shock.

&quot;Shut up May, you bitch!&quot;

&quot;HEY THAT&#39;S ENOUGH SAKURA!&quot; The class rep, Hilary stood up. &quot;Now look, 
Ash is a lovely person, all he did was ask you a question.&quot;

&quot;And I gave him answer!&quot; Sakura sulked as she crossed her arms holding 
back tears.

&quot;Not in a very respectable manner,&quot; Hilary stated. &quot;I want you to 
apologize, otherwise I am reporting you to Principle Tsunade.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;Like you mean it!&quot;

&quot;Sorry!&quot; Sakura tried to say in a nice tone. She then ran to her seat, 
quickly collected her school stuff and stormed out of the class with 
tears rolling down her face. Ino sighed and gave Ash and May a dirty 
look. The blonde ended up picking up her stuff and started making her 
way out of the class as well.

&quot;Why do you have to be such an idiot Ash?&quot; Ino asked the raven haired 
boy as she stepped out of the door.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what went wrong with her?&quot; Hinata told Naruto honestly, 
Tima was able to overhear her.

&quot;Where do you want me to start?&quot; Tima asked. Kimura did nothing because 
he thought Sakura looked attractive when she was angry. He did admit, he 
pretty much liked the drama in St. Manga School. The class rep wasn&#39;t 
pleased with Kimura at all. He could have stopped it all, but did he no? 
Where was the discipline and order? No, he was too busy eyeing on school 
girls.

&quot;This is Principle Tsuande,&quot; the voice of the principle said through the 
microphones, the entire school could here her. &quot;Could all students and 
staff get ready for today&#39;s late assembly.&quot;

--

IAll the students had sat down in cold boring gray chairs. Sakura and 
Ino were nowhere to be found as whispers circulated around the room as 
Principle Tsunade stepped up on the stage. &quot;Everyone settle down.&quot; she 
demanded with a strict order. &quot;Now today&#39;s assembly will be taken by Mr 
Shinbo.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Granny Tsunade!&quot; Shinbo said cheerfully as Tsunade gave him a 
displesant look. &quot;For today&#39;s assembly, I&#39;ve arranged something; a 
little bit special.&quot; Shinbo announced as Sumono, a small little pink 
girl on his shoulder swayed as she nodded.

&quot;Very special!&quot; Sumono repeated as her fuchsia hair swayed either side 
of her adroable head.

&quot;What I&#39;ve done, with the help of my wife of course,&quot; Shinbo didn&#39;t want 
to take all the credit as he continued to talk to the students. &quot;I have 
arranged a former pupil, of her class, to come to talk to you about his 
experiences. Now I&#39;m sure he won;t mind me saying, he used to be a bit 
of a pervert, a rebel, always had his head in the clouds, now he&#39;s 
turned his life around.&quot; The front row, which included Sakura, Ino and 
Tenten silently giggled. The three girls had quite a good idea who Mr. 
Shinbo was referring to. &quot;My wife and I, think that his story is going 
to be an inspiration to all of us.&quot;

&quot;Inspiration!&quot; Sumono repeated.

&quot;On how to look at porn!&quot; Ino muttered under her breath.

&quot;So guys, give him a very warm welcome,&quot; Shinbo announced with a tone of 
enthusiasm as his arm pointed at the door. &quot;He&#39;s a very good friend of 
mine, Mister Hideki Motosuwa!&quot; The tall man, Hideki made his way onto 
the stage, with a slim blonde haired girl with him as well. Shinbo 
patted Hideki on the shoulder as everyone saw the girl in quite a very 
skimpy outfit. &quot;I see you&#39;ve brought Chii along with you today?&quot;

&quot;I sure have,&quot; Hideki smiled as he felt slightly nervous to the fact 
that over a thousand students were watching him. &quot;I couldn&#39;t come 
without Chii.&quot;

&quot;Chii wanted to come.&quot; The blonde replied as Mrs. Shinbo gave the three 
of them chairs. The three of them quickly sat down after that.

&quot;Now, you a few hours late, but never mind about that!&quot; Shinbo stated as 
he knew that assemblies usually started at the end of the day after 
registration. &quot;Now, we&#39;re here to talk about your experiences, before I 
met you, you were working in the farm.&quot;

&quot;Yes, very hard work.&quot; Hideki replied nodding his head as Chii nodded 
with him. &quot;It was a family farm, and my parents stopped paying my 
allowence and told me I had to go to cram school and earn a living for 
myself. I got into town and saw a lot of persacoms that looked so cute 
and amazing.&quot;

&quot;So at this point, we are living in the same department, and we both 
went to cram together, which is were we met my wife there. That&#39;s 
another story, so give us an explanation on what persacoms can do.&quot;

&quot;Perscoms, are like human shaped computers, they&#39;re cute and have the 
perfect body to go with it as well.&quot; Hideki explained.

&quot;Despite being persacoms being very expensive, you happened to found a 
persacom in the garbage, which was were you met Chii.&quot;

&quot;Chii is happy that Hideki found her.&quot; Chii announced in a cute robotic 
voice.

&quot;So it&#39;s easy to say that when you first had your persacom, you panicked 
a little. So you started screaming the place down and getting worried 
people will call you a pervert.&quot;

&quot;Yeah I knew nothing about computers or technology,&quot; Hideki admitted 
honestly.

&quot;You did teach Chii to learn to talk and move and run errands,&quot; Shinbo 
admitted. &quot;So that&#39;s god work from you. Now as time goes by, you two 
both fall in love and eventually become an item. So how does it feel to 
be dating a computer?&quot;

&quot;Feels like dating any other normal girl,&quot; he replied honestly. &quot;You 
love me don&#39;t you Chii?&quot;

&quot;Chii loves Hideki!&quot; Chii smiled as she petted Hideki on the cheek. The 
girls awed as some of the guys seemed bored.

&quot;so Hideki has done very well for himself, after his college course in 
Foundation ICT, he and Chii adopted a little girl, and what did you name 
your adopted daughter?&quot;

&quot;Chii named the baby Boobies because Hideki said likes them.&quot; Chii 
admitted as there was a sudden moment of dead silence.

&quot;Erm... Boobies!&quot; Shinbo said as the majority of the school erupted with 
laughter. &quot; So, how are you two coping with parenthood?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re coping pretty well,&quot; Hideki nodded as his persacom smiled. 
&quot;Chii&#39;s managing to hold the baby fine. Our manager&#39;s been very kind 
with supporting Boobies as well.&quot; They roared with laughter again as 
they all thought that Boobies, was certainly not a name that they would 
call their daughter.

&quot;So what can we, take away from today?&quot; Shinbo asked the school. &quot;I 
think a message of hope. Because my friend Hideki, has changed his life 
for the better and is doing fine with the help of his friends. You&#39;re 
still working at my pleasure aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;I sure am!&quot; Hideki grinned.

&quot;So give up hope people!&quot; Sumono squealed. &quot;Don&#39;t forget about the other 
auditions for the school show today.&quot; She announced rather off topic. 
&quot;Mr. Kakashi and Miss Lust are still looking for new people to perform 
and they said they were very amazed by yesterday&#39;s auditions.&quot;

Davis Motomiya was then reminded that his audition date was today. He 
was only doing to impress Kari with what he can do. The auburn haired 
boy hoped with the help of Yolei, Cody, Yomi, Tomo, Ed, Al and Ken and 
Tala with a performance he hoped to be good enough to impress Kari and 
be on his way to win her heart. The dancing was sorted and the costumes 
were ready as well. Davis was going to perform, one of the most popular 
songs ever and had a feeling it was going to be remembered.
