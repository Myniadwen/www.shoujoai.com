In the cool night Ino took me under her comforter. Holding me in a 
lovers embrace, her arms wrapped around me like angel&#39;s wings, to guard 
me from the darkness. As the nightingale&#39;s sweet song laid my soul to 
rest, Ino stirred. She moved over me, pressing deep kisses down my neck, 
and under my jaw nipping at my flesh. The sensation of hard teeth 
grazing delicate skin made me gasp, my head thrown back as a low moan 
escaped.

&quot;I-Ino...&quot; I cried, tangling my hands in her hair, white blond, thin 
silky locks lightened by the sun, drinking in its warmth during the hot 
day.

&quot;Sakura,&quot; Ino whispered, her breath in my ear, heating its shell inside, 
down to the recesses of the canal. &quot;What you want?&quot;

&quot;That dream,&quot; I replied, my mind and body lost in sensations, consumed 
again by a fire burning through me. &quot;Your dream.&quot; What&#39;s a dream for if 
you don&#39;t live it?

Ino settled on her side covered from the shoulders down, with one arm 
pillowed beneath her head, the other lain across her chest. &quot;You sure, 
Sakura?&quot; she asked, voice tinged with fear.

I nodded and held her close. &quot;Yes!&quot; With you and only you.

She understood. Any hesitation Ino felt melted away when she kissed the 
dip in the base of my neck, running her hands over my arms, along each 
curve and muscle. I took a deep breath, falling into our dream spiraling 
down. Plunging further into the senses, where one&#39;s spirit comes to life 
in the flesh as they connect to another, knowing they are more than just 
their body. Seeking Oneness beyond the physical, reaching new states of 
the mind, when the soul soars up toward heaven. I was taken there as my 
body reached new states of awareness.

Ino&#39;s POV

In my explorations I discovered new landscapes. The flat plain of her 
stomach was soft and pale, an alabaster white pure as a field of freshly 
fallen snow. Further up, the snow covered plains sloped up slightly, 
forming smooth rounded hills. On each of them grew a flower, tiny buds 
ready to burst into bloom, their hue the color of cherry blossoms. 
Beyond gentle hills, pink buds and snowy plains, her neck rose up 
elegant and proud. A warm flush tinged it in rosy tones, hinting to a 
hidden inner excitement, of journeys unspoken and senses experienced for 
the very first time. Discovering what it meant to be human in love, 
close to one another.

In this discovery, my sight wandered to her chin, finding thin lips, 
turned in each corner as a soft smile rose. Her eyes were halfway 
closed, green like emeralds, cast down in a meditative gaze. She seemed 
to look deep within and out at the same time, as if aware of both the 
inner and outer realms. I was her outer realm, the one outside who 
wanted to know her. And make her happy. Leaning over, I claimed her lips 
in a kiss, bringing a glow of joy, a brightness on her face.

&quot;Ino, I-I love you,&quot; came her whisper, escaping parted lips.

&quot;Sakura, I...&quot; An utterance caught in my throat.

&quot;It&#39;s okay. I know,&quot; Sakura replied, laying a finger over my lips.

A softening in her eyes told me she understood. Sometimes the deepest of 
emotions are those beyond expression, joined by feelings in the heart. 
The feelings in both of our hearts drew us closer as the sun touching 
the earth when it sets. Driven by them, I bent over letting my lips meet 
hers. Under the touch she gasped, her lids tightly closed, as she looked 
deep within. Pink hair framed her sweet girlish face, swept away in 
pleasure. She almost forgot about me until her eyes opened halfway, 
yearning for my intimacy.

Excited by her want, I grinned pulling her against me. Our bodies grew 
warm with passion&#39;s heat, pressed together in a tender embrace, feeling 
love enflame us. A single fire blazed out from both of our hearts 
burning brightly within and without when we gazed into each other&#39;s 
eyes. I saw my reflection in her jade green orbs. She saw hers in mine, 
a dark aquamarine. Jade and aquamarine mirrored one another with our 
reflections staring back.

&quot;Sakura, I can...say it,&quot; I uttered breathlessly.

&quot;Say what?&quot; she teased back, cupping my face in her hands.

&quot;It&#39;s a secret.&quot; I grinned, diving under the covers.

&quot;Oh, Ino. Tell me!&quot; Sakura insisted, wrestling underneath to join me.

Under the tumble of blankets I pinned her down beneath me. &quot;Not until 
you beat me,&quot; I countered back.

Suddenly, she surged up from behind knocking me flat. Kicking the 
blankets partly off, she pinned me down in reverse, holding my wrists 
above my head.

&quot;Now, you&#39;d better tell me, Ino.&quot; Pleasure flared in her grin.

&quot;I love you,&quot; I replied lustily, letting my head roll to the side and 
twisting my hips to entice her.

First, surprise broke out. Then desire shot through as her visage ran 
over me. She cocked her head, lowering her body on mine. &quot;Oh, you&#39;re 
just teasing me.&quot;

I chuckled, pulling my wrists out of her grasp. &quot;No, Sakura, I&#39;m not. 
I&#39;ll show you.&quot;

&quot;Just try to,&quot; she taunted playfully, grabbing me tightly.

&quot;Alright, I will.&quot; I smirked, rolling over atop her. This time, through 
love, and not fighting I could finally prove myself to her. I wasted no 
time allowing all ambition to rise, possessing me from the core.

An unspoken fire had always burned between us. I always thought it was 
our jealousy over Sasuke. But with him gone, I think I&#39;m starting to 
truly understand things. I was jealous because I felt she no longer 
wanted me, no loved me. Feeling hurt, I didn&#39;t know what to do, or how 
to tell her. So I started grabbing Sasuke from her in front of her eyes 
any chance I&#39;d get. It was the only way she paid attention to me, even 
if it was negative. I guess that&#39;s how jealous I really was. Perhaps the 
more jealous a person becomes, the greater their love must be towards 
that particular person.

It was her affection I longed for all those years hurting inside cause 
it wasn&#39;t mine. Sakura wasn&#39;t happy either pouring out her heart for a 
boy that never returned her affections. Sasuke probably just saw her as 
a friend, or a teammate at most. She wanted more, and that&#39;s what left 
her wounded. Somehow, that wound in her remaining, and the wound in me 
from being neglected gradually healed over in our new relationship. I 
would like to tell you how that final healing took place.

&quot;Sakura, I love you...cause I&#39;ll never leave you,&quot; I said to her through 
words.

Through my actions, I did my best to show her how I felt. My lips danced 
a trail of sweet kisses from her lips to her chest, planting a gentle 
kiss on each sweet nub. Moving down the gentle slope of breasts to the 
flat plain of her stomach, I found it to be a familiar landscape. It 
felt silky and smooth, flawless without blemish, white as freshly fallen 
snow. Not cold but warm alive and tender, hot with life and passion.

Feeling her life force sparked deeper feelings held within me, building 
inside during our years apart when she was all I thought of. That inner 
wellspring of emotion finally broke free this very moment, flowing like 
a boundless river, deep feelings throughout every atom of my being, down 
in the strata of my soul. I truly came alive with some happiness unlike 
any other.

Sakura must have felt it in the sacred dance between us. In new 
landscapes and forms discovered beyond that snow covered plains, hidden 
valleys were found. Flowers once concealed finally opened their sweet 
petals to spring&#39;s fresh air. Hummingbirds whirred nearby, delighted by 
such beauty. A fragrant scent lured them in. Their thin tongues darted 
out from between long delicate beaks into open blossoms. Reaching 
inside, loving tongues coaxed out sweet nectar that sparkled like 
diamonds on dew drenched petals. Filled with the vigor to fly once 
again, the hummingbirds departed, having tasted the finest divine 
ambrosia, experienced by the senses in joy, pure intimacy and love.

Snowy plains, once tranquil and silent heaved up as they melted in the 
sun. Slopes leading up to hills shook slightly breaking free of 
restraint and stillness. Young buds once dormant in winter blossomed to 
their fullest announcing the coming of spring. Alive with passion, all 
of the earth&#39;s bodyscape erupted with a fury buried inside, from the 
depths of her very soul.

Alive and free, Sakura sprawled out on the bed, breathing heavily and 
coated in sweat. A smile rose on her blossom pink lips. Her jade orbs, 
sparkling and alive like emeralds in their depths, danced with joy.

Lying beside her, I cupped her cheek in my hand. Her round fair face 
softened under my touch. During our dance a silent message had passed 
between us, an exchange between hearts through the soul and body as one. 
We knew each other&#39;s hearts, having flied high in spirit. Some might 
call it dreams. Some might call it heaven in the throes of passion. I 
called it love. Our love. Sakura&#39;s and mine.

Rolling over onto her side, facing me, she laid a hand on my cheek in 
return. Her curious gaze shined brightly. In a soft voice, barely 
audible above a whisper, almost dreamlike she said, &quot;Ino, you really 
love me, don&#39;t you?&quot;

I could only nod in return, feeling my face brush against the bed sheet.

&quot;I...I never thought anyone would.&quot; Sakura cast her sight downward at 
our feet avoiding eye contact as she spoke.

&quot;I always...did,&quot; I finally admitted, hugging her tightly. Tears welled 
in my eyes. &quot;But couldn&#39;t say it.&quot;

&quot;Ino-chan, it&#39;s not your fault,&quot; Sakura replied gently, casting her 
visage back up. &quot;We were rivals then.&quot;

&quot;Are we...still?&quot; I asked sadly, releasing my grip on her.

Sakura shook her head, pulling me back in our embrace. &quot;No, I don&#39;t want 
that. Ever again.&quot;

A wave of relief washed over me. &quot;Me too. I&#39;m so glad you said that.&quot; I 
settled in her grasp. &quot;But what if Sasuke-kun returns?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Sakura reassured me, resting in my arms. &quot;We&#39;ll be 
friends. I just hope Naruto can bring him to the light.&quot;

&quot;The light,&quot; I murmured softly. &quot;I think he will.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Sakura questioned.

&quot;Well, they are friends aren&#39;t they? Like us,&quot; I explained to her.

&quot;Sort of.&quot; Sakura thought deeply. &quot;Naruto is the light, wanting to save 
Sasuke, the darkness.&quot;

&quot;Then we are flowers,&quot; I decided, thinking about how we blossomed in our 
journey together.

&quot;And friends too.&quot; Sakura kissed me tonight, falling asleep in my arms.

&quot;Yes, I think that is what friends are for,&quot; I whispered, drifting off 
to sleep.
