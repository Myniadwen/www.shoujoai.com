<h1>St Manga School (part 15 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../naruto/index.html">Naruto</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../naruto/stmanga-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>Harley adored the painting that he had drawn of Mr. Blackadder as he 
felt that Blackadder looked adorable in his painting. He adored it, the 
colors were bright and beautiful to his eyes, and the background was 
stylish and trendy. In the painting, Blackadder was holding five kittens 
in his arms, although he would never do this in real life, he thought it 
was a sweet idea. Tomo stared at the painting, thinking it wasn&#39;t really 
good and decided it needed much more tweaking. She was still wearing her 
underpants on her head, as Yolei was still in some of her lessons.

Sakaki then joined Tomo as she looked on on the painting. She didn&#39;t 
like how the cat&#39;s didn&#39;t have any eyes, and watched Tomo try and edit 
it with her pen.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Sakaki asked Tomo as she watched Tomo add eyes to 
the painting.

&quot;That painting&#39;s crap,&quot; Tomo admitted her own opinion. &quot;It needed some 
eyes as well, so it will need some fixing.&quot;

Harley overheard this, and was very offended, he spent a lot of time 
working on that picture and felt that Tomo was very arrogant and did not 
understand the beauty of his art. &quot;Tomo stop being a bitch.&quot; he cried 
out as he was quickly starting to get furious over what Tomo was doing 
to his picture.

&quot;I&#39;m only trying to help.&quot; Tomo replied as she ignored Harley&#39;s request.

&quot;Then why did you say it was crap?&quot; His eyes were starting to swell up 
as he was quickly starting to cry.

Tomo felt a heavy feeling in her nose. The feeling was as if she was 
about to sneeze really badly. Then she let out a massive &quot;ACTHOO!&quot; 
Sakaki felt a sudden shock as she saw the snot that landed on the 
painting.

&quot;I don&#39;t think Harley&#39;s going to be happy about that.&quot; Sakaki pointed 
out as it was clearly obvious the painting had been sneezed on. &quot;He&#39;s 
gonna be upset.&quot;

Tomo tried to rub the snot from the painting, with very careful detail. 
Harley gasped in horror as he stood up and marched over to his painting. 
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Harley asked in frustration. Tomo and Sakaki 
walked away as they returned to the table, where Yolei, Tima and Yomi 
were doing their work. Meanwhile, Harley rushed to his picture whilst he 
faced Tomo. &quot;Who the hell do you think you are Tomo?&quot; Harley asked as 
looked furious. &quot;You think you can just go and ruin other people&#39;s work, 
would you do that to other paintings? No would not!&quot; He gasped as he saw 
the slime on his painting. &quot;WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO IT?&quot; Harley was 
screaming as he began to cry.

&quot;It needed more work on it.&quot; Tomo replied. &quot;It needed whiskers as well, 
but I didn&#39;t mean to sneeze on it. Sorry!&quot;

&quot;Bitch!&quot; the purple haired lad then marched out of the room and covered 
his head with his hands.

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to upset him.&quot; Tomo pointed out, dropping her head on the 
table. &quot;I meant it as a joke, and the sneezing was an accident. He&#39;s 
being a total drama king!&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you chase him and apologize to him?&quot; Yomi suggested as she 
looked down on her.

As Harley marched out of the room, he saw Drew walking along the art 
room. He instantly saw that Harley was upset, although Vicky was walking 
with Drew and he wasn&#39;t so sure if he liked Vicky that much at all.

&quot;Oh my God Harley, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Vicky quickly asked Harley as she 
grabbed him by the shoulders. She allowed Harley to rest on her shocking 
pink jacket. &quot;Who&#39;s upset you?&quot;

&quot;Tomo!&quot; Harley yelled out. &quot;She rubbed her snot on my painting and 
spoilt it!&quot;

&quot;Oh my God!&quot; Vicky exclaimed, &quot;I so can&#39;t believe she just done that.&quot; 
Vicky was livid as her fist followed her to the art room. &quot;You are well 
going to get beaten Tomo!&quot; Vickie snapped the moment she stormed into 
the art room. &quot;You think you&#39;re so funny don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to do it!&quot; Tomo muttered. &quot;It was an accident.&quot;

&quot;Oh really,&quot; Vicky replied with an unimpressed tone. &quot;Why the hell is 
Harley crying his eyes out! What did you do to the painting?&quot; Yomi 
pointed to Harley&#39;s painting and Vicky was horrified. &quot;Tomo, you are 
such a scruff!&quot;

&quot;Vicky you&#39;re making it much worse then it needs to be,&quot; Drew stated. 
&quot;We better hit back to class.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll catch up!&quot; Vicky said. &quot;I&#39;ll see ya later Drew!&quot; Drew was then out 
of the situation as Vicky remained in the room and glared at Tomo with 
evil eyes. &quot;You think you&#39;re so clever don&#39;t ya? Yeah but no, but yeah 
but no but yeah, cause you tried to destroy Harley&#39;s painting with your 
boogie because you&#39;re such a scruff!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re so fat, you had to sit on a student because the chair would have 
broken if you sat on them!&quot; Tomo snapped as much to Yomi&#39;s disapproval.

&quot;I ain&#39;t even done nothing or nothing!&quot; Vicky snapped as she wrinkled 
her face. &quot;Have you been talking to Chiyo?&quot; she asked the rest of the 
class. &quot;She reckons that Sakura&#39;s pregnant with one of the Uchiha 
brothers because she had a threesome with them. Anyway, don&#39;t listen to 
her because she wet herself.&quot;

&quot;No she didn&#39;t!&quot; Tomo snapped in fury. &quot;You&#39;re being a bitch, like 
you&#39;ve always been. I hope you get expelled.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot;

&quot;You shut up!&quot;

&quot;No you shut up!&quot;

&quot;HOW ABOUT THE PAIR OF YOU SHUT UP?&quot; Yolei demanded.

&quot;OK guys chill!&quot; Tima advised.

Meanwhile Osaka was asleep the whole time and was singing nursery 
rhymes. &quot;Fr&egrave;re Jacques! Fr&egrave;re Jacques! Dormez-vous? Dormez-vous?&quot; Whilst 
sleeping as she sang her head moved left to right. &quot;Sonnez les matines! 
Sonnez les matines! Ding dang dong! Ding dang dong!&quot; Osaka&#39;s singing had 
caused sudden silence. &quot;Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pale 
of water, Jack fell down and broke his crown and Jill came tumbling 
after.&quot;

&quot;You guys are right retard!&quot; Vicky shouted out.

&quot;Vicky don&#39;t take this further!&quot; Yolei requested. &quot;Otherwise, loads of 
people are going to get involved when it&#39;s not needed&quot;

The green head returned to the class room. &quot;Vicky, Mr. Blackadder wants 
you back now!&quot;

&quot;Well Blackadder can fuck himself!&quot; Vicky replied. &quot;He can have a bit of 
Sakura Haruno if he wants!&quot;

&quot;You make her sound like a whore,&quot; Drew stated.

&quot;Because SHE IS!&quot;

&quot;Dudes this is going too far!&quot; Tima added, &quot;You guys better stop before 
things go too far!&quot;

&quot;Tomo&#39;s doing it in spite!&quot; Harley squealed. &quot;She&#39;s trying to make me 
look like an idiot!&quot;

&quot;No wonder he can&#39;t get a girlfriend,&quot; Himeno told Tai, who was Kari 
Yagami&#39;s older brother. Her hair was a blend of orange and pink and her 
blue eyes concealed an emotional image.

&quot;Or boyfriend!&quot; Tai pointed out.

&quot;I&#39;d remain quiet, if I were you.&quot; Matt Ishida whispered. He was a dear 
friend of Tai&#39;s and was Takeru Takashi&#39;s brother. &quot;He might go mad!&quot;

&quot;STOP BITCHING ABOUT HARLEY!&quot; Brock snapped at Tai with a look of envy. 
&quot;You two are a pair of jerks!&quot; Brock pointed at Tai and Matt. &quot;Trying to 
score another girl are you?&quot; asked Brock in a bitter tone to Matt.

&quot;You&#39;re only jealous because I&#39;ve had more sex than you.&quot; Matt replied 
as if he didn&#39;t care what Brock had to say.

&quot;You&#39;re going to be a virgin forever!&quot; Tai replied to Brock. &quot;Anyway, 
the painting looks much better with Tomo&#39;&#39;s effects.&quot;

&quot;I bet you two have gay sex every night!&quot; Brock roared in a dismal tone.

&quot;Just ignore him Tai,&quot; Matt whispered to him. &quot;He&#39;s just being desperate 
for the female&#39;s attention.&quot;

&quot;Harley,&quot; Brock nudged Harley&#39;s shoulder. &quot;This is bullying, the teacher 
needs to get back soon!&quot;

&quot;HOW THE HELL IS THAT BULLYING?&quot; Tai shouted out. &quot;Tomo was only trying 
to help! She said sorry!&quot;

&quot;Well sorry isn&#39;t good enough!&quot; Brock snapped in fury. &quot;Tomo destroyed 
Harley&#39;s painting in spite!&quot;

&quot;I thought you&#39;d be on the girl&#39;s side?&quot; Tai asked in an act of sarcasm.

&quot;I&#39;m not taking any sides,&quot; Brock stated. &quot;All I&#39;m doing is saying that 
Harley worked very hard on this picture and Tomo spoiled it!&quot;

&quot;Looks Okay to me,&quot; Joey Wheeler expressed his thoughts. &quot;Kinda unique, 
although at the same time the booger part is pretty gross when you think 
about it! You guys don&#39;t need to worry at all!&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re bullying us!&quot; Brock thought out aloud.

&quot;You know what Matt and Tai are like,&quot; Joey replied. &quot;They&#39;re just 
messing around having fun. Tima&#39;&#39;s right we should chill!&quot;

At this point, Drew had already left and Vicky was still standing there 
and had her eyes on Joey. She loved his blonde hair and his eyes and his 
clothes were so stylish, she wanted him. Vicky also thought that Tai and 
Matt were gorgeous too, she heard that a few people in her class though 
that those two were getting in on in secret. She would have loved to 
have seen it, it would have been so hot.
