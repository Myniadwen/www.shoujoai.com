<h1>Practice Makes Perfect (part 14 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../naruto/index.html">Naruto</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nighinvis.html">nighinvisible</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../naruto/pracperfect-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Blinking back tears, Ino shook with rage once she heard the door close 
behind her. She was so furious with Sakura. Wait, no. She was so furious 
with herself. Sakura was still partially to blame, but Ino had allowed 
it to happen. Shikamaru had once told her he admired how she never 
seemed to lie to herself. But in that moment, Ino realized she had been 
lying to herself for so long she could no longer remember the full 
truth. How long had she been in love with Sakura? How long had she 
pretended to love and desire men, denying her own true feelings? As each 
memory from her childhood flashed through her mind, she suddenly saw her 
lies, her blanket of denial. Why she had really protected Sakura. Her 
strange desire in a Kunoichi class about how, in very rare missions, it 
was necessary for a female ninja to seduce another female. Her rivalry 
over Sasuke. It had all been because Ino didn&#39;t want to see Sakura with 
him.

She remembered the flash of terror in Sakura&#39;s eyes when Sasuke had 
caught them. No one, not even Uchiha Sasuke, should ever scare Sakura 
that much. Especially Sasuke, if he was her boyfriend. Sakura shouldn&#39;t 
be that afraid of the man she loves.

She doesn&#39;t love him.

It was suddenly so clear to Ino. Sakura didn&#39;t love Sasuke.

Wheeling around to the back of the apartment in a rage, Ino saw them 
through Sakura&#39;s window, talking. Sakura seemed to be on the defensive. 
Ignoring all of her instincts, Ino crouched and framed Sakura in her 
fingers.

Ino was in such a blaze of emotion that all of her other senses were 
dulled. She never realized that someone she new very well was hiding 
nearby, watching her.

- - - - - - -

His own girlfriend was hiding something from him. He couldn&#39;t believe he 
was expected to swallow Ino&#39;s story about some piece of clothing. He had 
been standing there long enough to catch the last bit of conversation 
and the chill in Ino&#39;s voice.

&quot;No! It isn&#39;t like that, Ino! Just come back upstairs! Please. 
This...this will be the last time, I promise.&quot;

&quot;No. Eat it, Sakura. I&#39;m through.&quot;

The last time for what? And Sakura&#39;s face when she realized he had been 
listening...hell, her face now! He had obviously caught her in the act 
of hiding something she truly didn&#39;t want him to know about.

Another man. That was the only answer, of course. His biggest fear was 
being realized in front of him. Uchiha Sasuke was losing to some other 
guy.

He glared at Sakura, causing her to shrink back.

&quot;Sasuke! It isn&#39;t what you think&#151;&quot;

&quot;What am I thinking, Sakura, that has you so worried?&quot;

She cowered a little more, raising her hands up helplessly.

&quot;Uh, I, I don&#39;t know! It was just a little fight, that&#39;s all, you heard 
Ino&#151;&quot;

&quot;I highly doubt Ino was telling the truth.&quot;

Sakura went cold. He knew. He had to, because she could see a look of 
determination in his eyes that she only ever saw when he was preparing 
to fight another ninja.

&quot;Sasuke, please&#151;&quot;

But Sakura never got the chance to finish.

- - - - - - - - -

Shikamaru had been trailing Ino all afternoon. He had watched her pace 
around the place she shared with Chouji, checking her watch, before 
marching out and hurrying over to Sakura&#39;s place. Ino was obviously 
waiting for something she had planned with Sakura, but it had not been 
the regular, enjoyable wait of two friends. She had headed over there 
like she had been on a mission.

Ino had entered Sakura&#39;s house. Then he had seen the girls upstairs. And 
then he became confused. Sakura had been trying to shove Ino in a 
closet.

What the hell is Sakura doing to Ino?

But a minute later Ino had burst out, looking very, very irate. The two 
girls were fighting and Ino was charging back downstairs.

What the fuck is going on!

Shikamaru watched them fight, neglecting to see until the last moment 
Uchiha Sasuke arrive. He watched Sasuke go in. For a moment, he couldn&#39;t 
see anything that was happening, but then a very upset looking Ino came 
out the front door, closing it fast behind her. She stood still, fuming, 
and he could tell she was about to cry. Sakura and Sasuke had gone 
upstairs, Sasuke looking none too pleased and Sakura looking like a 
trapped animal.

Just when Shikamaru thought he couldn&#39;t be anymore confused, he saw 
Ino&#39;s head jerked up with a determined look. She moved around to the 
side of the building, crouch down...and then her body collapsed. 
Shikamaru was her teammate and he had seen the move countless times.

Ino, you are in the middle of the street, are you insane? She had 
abandoned her body, and he knew she was in either Sasuke or Sakura. He 
hoped for her sake it was her friend, because Uchiha Sasuke would not 
take lightly the invasion of his body.

Still not knowing what to think, Shikamaru rushed over and worked to 
drag Ino&#39;s body out of the street to safety. After propping her up, he 
moved back to watch Sasuke and Sakura and try and figure out just what 
in the hell Ino was up to.

- - - - - - - -

&quot;Sasuke, Please&#151;&quot;

But Sakura never got the chance to finish. Her hands dropped limply to 
her sides and, for a second, her eyes glazed over. But then Sakura stood 
up straighter and looked Sasuke straight in the idea.

&quot;Please what, Sakura?&quot;

Sakura&#39;s voice came cold and steady.

&quot;Please understand, Sasuke. I never meant to hurt you.&quot;

Sasuke felt his anger rising, but in his typical way, kept his outside 
calm and reserved.

&quot;What did you say?&quot;

&quot;I never meant to hurt you, but this, us, well...I don&#39;t think we are 
working out.&quot;

&quot;You seemed fine with &#39;us&#39; just last week.&quot; He had made the word &quot;us&quot; as 
nasty as he could. Sakura was going down a road she might regret and he 
was trying to warn her of her peril.

&quot;I don&#39;t think we should see each other romantically anymore.&quot; Sakura 
paused, and then added for emphasis, &quot;I don&#39;t love you.&quot;

The words hit him in the gut like Tsunade&#39;s fist. I don&#39;t love you. His 
whole life he had had one constant, one steady and unwavering thing: 
Sakura&#39;s complete love for him. And now he was hearing that maybe he had 
been wrong about even that.

&quot;Impossible.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t make this anymore difficult than it already is, Sasuke. After 
all, we are still on a team together.&quot;

Sasuke was barely able to contain he seething at this point.

&quot;Tell me one thing, Sakura.&quot;

&quot;Ok.&quot;

&quot;Who is it?&quot;

Sakura looked confused. &quot;Who is who, Sasuke?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t play dumb. Who is he?&quot;

Understanding suddenly dawned on Ino. Yes, Ino. She was possessing 
Sakura&#39;s body like she had done countless times before. There had once 
been a time when Sakura&#39;s second personality had been so strong she had 
been able to force Ino out of her body. But all of their practice 
sessions had dulled Sakura&#39;s inner strength and reflexes, and Ino had 
become able to maintain a strong hold on Sakura for a prolonged period 
of time. After all...practice makes perfect.

The whole time Sakura had been yelling futilely at Ino.

&quot;INO? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? I&#39;M SORRY I HURT YOU BUT YOU MUST 
STOP THIS NOW!&quot;

&quot;No, Sakura. I am doing you a favor.&quot;

&quot;THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL A FAVOR? I HAVE LOVED UCHIHA SASUKE ALL OF MY 
LIFE AND NOW YOU ARE THROWING ALL OF THAT AWAY OVER SOME PETTY GRUDGE!&quot;

&quot;Petty grudge? Don&#39;t talk about things you don&#39;t understand, Sakura.&quot;

&quot;THEN TELL ME! MAKE ME UNDERSTAND!&quot;

&quot;Now isn&#39;t time for that. Now is the time for me to help you finish 
this.&quot;

&quot;NO! DON&#39;T DO IT! I LOVE HIM.&quot;

&quot;No. You don&#39;t love him Sakura. And he doesn&#39;t love you. Listen to what 
he is saying. He is not angry at losing you, he is angry because he 
thinks he is losing you to another man.&quot;

&quot;INO YOU ARE WRONG! HE IS UPSET BECAUSE YOU ARE DESTROYING OUR 
RELATIONSHIP!&quot;

Sakura was growing stronger in her panic and Ino knew she would be hard 
pressed to continue her hold without Sasuke noticing.

&quot;There is no other man, Sasuke.&quot;

&quot;Of course there is, that is the only explanation.&quot;

Ino felt herself get perturbed at that remark.

&quot;Sasuke, do you think it is possible to believe that maybe you aren&#39;t as 
amazing as you think you are? That maybe, for once in your life, you are 
just not as good at something?&quot;

Faster than her eyes could follow, Sasuke&#39;s fist punched a hole through 
the wall next to them. The noise and speed scared Ino and she was forced 
the step back.

&quot;INNNOOOOOOOOO&#151;&quot;

The Uchiha immediately resumed his calm fa&ccedil;ade and walked to the window. 
She watched him grip the window seal so hard his knuckles turned white.

&quot;I see.&quot; His voice was stone, and Ino realized how stupid she was. Her 
body would still be out there in plain view. Sasuke was no fool&#151;she had 
been caught.

&quot;Sasuke---&quot;

It was barely a whisper, but she caught it before he turned and ran out 
the door and down the stairs.

&quot;Shikamaru.&quot;

What? Ino raced over to the window to see Shikamaru&#39;s eyes wide with 
panic. They met hers and she caught the flash of his fingers forming a 
seal. He looked strained, as if he was trying to maintain control over a 
powerful force with his shadow jutsu.

Sasuke.

Ino couldn&#39;t decide if it was better to try and release her jutsu or 
maintain Sakura&#39;s body.

&quot;INO-PIG, HURRY AND HELP HIM!&quot;

Sakura&#39;s voice was the motivation Ino needed and they went flying down 
the stairs in pursuit.

- - - - - -

&quot;So you thought you could steal her from me.&quot; Sasuke&#39;s Sharingan flashed 
dangerously as he tried to figure out a way to escape Shikamaru&#39;s hold 
on him.

Shika looked as confused as possible while dealing with the large amount 
of strain in took to hold back an irate Uchiha.

&quot;I don&#39;t...know...what you are...talking about.&quot; It was hard for him to 
even speak, he needed to maintain so much focus.

&quot;Sakura. You saw something that was mine and you decided to take it. 
That is unacceptable.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m as confused...as you are, Sasuke...please...let&#39;s talk about this.&quot;

&quot;No. I don&#39;t talk. I am always the best, do you understand? I own her 
and you have overstepped your bounds. Now let me go!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m...not...letting you go...until you listen to me.&quot;

&quot;You have nothing to say that I want to hear!&quot;

&quot;I do...though. If you would just...calm down...and look in those 
bushes...over there.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t pull any dumb tricks like that on me.&quot;

The pressure was beginning to overwhelm Shikamaru and in his 
frustration, he forgot his fear.

&quot;Don&#39;t be a complete fool, Uchiha. Look in the bushes.&quot;

Shikamaru upped his last reserves of chakra to look at the bushes, 
straight at Ino&#39;s limp body. His jutsu forced Sasuke to do the same.

&quot;I don&#39;t see the point of thi&#151;What is she doing here?&quot;

A bit of Sasuke&#39;s pressure released and Shikamaru was able to reaffirm 
his shadow&#39;s grip on Sasuke.

&quot;Ino is not in her body. She has performed her jutsu. I just caught her 
and I couldn&#39;t tell if she had taken over you or Sakura. Since you are 
trying to kill me&#151;&quot;

&quot;Ino is in Sakura.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;She said those things.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what was said, but I wish you would stop trying to attack 
me.&quot;

Sasuke relaxed just a bit, but Shikamaru kept him under the jutsu 
regardless. He didn&#39;t trust the Uchiha.

&quot;I thought you had tried to steal something that was mine alone. You 
swear that you have not been with Sakura?&quot;

&quot;Not after you began dating her, no. I swear it. I know as little as you 
do about what is going on.&quot;

Shikamaru finally released his justsu. Sasuke just stood there, his 
brows furrowed in thought. Just then, Ino&#39;s body began to move, and she 
unsteadily lifted herself up. She had used too much chakra and her whole 
being ached, her mind barely able to stay focused.

Sasuke&#39;s eyes narrowed. He started to march toward the blond ninja. When 
Shikamaru realized that Sasuke&#39;s violent focus had shifted to his 
teammate, he desperately began the seals for his jutsu again, but he 
knew he wouldn&#39;t be in time&#151;

He didn&#39;t have to be. A flash of pink intercepted Sasuke and a quick 
hand shot up, slapping Uchiha Sasuke against the face. With the strength 
that Tsunade had taught her. Sasuke went flying into the apartment, 
crashing hard into the siding.

Somewhere, Ino&#39;s meek voice said, &quot;You...gotta watch out, Sakura. With 
that strength...you are going to kill...someone.&quot;

A small smirk tugged at the corner of Sakura&#39;s mouth. &quot;I won&#39;t kill him. 
I feel like killing him, but I won&#39;t.&quot;

Sasuke slowly stood up and look with anger and questioning at his 
girlfriend.

&quot;What was that for, Sakura?&quot;

&quot;Because you deserved it.&quot;

His hand went up and rubbed his bruised jaw. She could hit so hard.

When he didn&#39;t say anything, she continued.

&quot;You own me? I don&#39;t think so. How dare you presume ownership of me.&quot;

&quot;I only meant that you were my girlfriend&#151;&quot;

&quot;No you didn&#39;t. You...you meant it just as you said it. As if I was some 
sort of prize.&quot; Hurt spread across her face with the realization of 
truth. &quot;I am a prize to you, aren&#39;t I? You only wanted me when I 
suddenly became unavailable. You...probably only kept me around because 
you needed to maintain a hold on me. To own me.&quot;

&quot;Sakura, you are looking at this&#151;&quot;

&quot;No, Sasuke, save it. I can see clearly now, probably for the first time 
ever. Be honest with yourself. Do you now, or did you ever really love 
me?&quot;

Sasuke stared at her, and she worried in that moment that she would fall 
into those eyes and lose everything all over again.

&quot;No. You are right. I never loved you.&quot;

The words stung, but somewhere she felt a strange sense of relief, as if 
a huge blanket had just been taken off her and she could move freely 
again.

&quot;Go home, Uchiha.&quot;

&quot;I will, but not yet.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Want to pick some more fights over petty jealousy?&quot;

He only glared in response to her comment. Then he shifted his attention 
to Ino.

&quot;No. I want to know what in the hell is going on.&quot;

- - - - - - - - -

Most days Shikamaru regretted getting pulled into other people&#39;s 
affairs. They were troublesome and tiring. This day, he absolutely hated 
every minute of it. He had thought that he had known Ino, his ex...his 
friend...and his teammate. But after Sasuke had forced a confession out 
of Ino and Sakura, Shikamaru felt completely lost. Ino was a stranger to 
him. Because the Ino he thought he knew was honest and loyal and would 
never, ever do anything to hurt a teammate.

After the confession, Sasuke had reacted quite differently than 
Shikamaru would have expected. When hearing their story, he expected the 
Uchiha to go flying off the handle at any moment. But the boy&#39;s face had 
turned to stone, unmoving. When they finished, he nodded and began to 
walk home. Sakura made a small attempt to stop him, but she was smart 
enough to eventually just let him go.

Then there were three of them. Shikamaru just looked at Sakura, and she 
at Ino, and Ino looked at the ground, each of them trying to figure out 
what to do next. Finally, Sakura had been unable to hold back her tears 
when the reality of what had happened sunk in and she ran into her 
apartment, locking the door behind her.

So now he was sitting next to Ino but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to speak 
to her, or even look at her. He felt so betrayed, and he was not even 
her boyfriend. Oh god, her boyfriend.

&quot;How am I ever going to tell Chouji this, Ino?&quot;

Her big blue eyes met his and he saw the complete and absolute pain in 
them.

&quot;How could you do that to him? How could you do that to the man you 
love&#151;&quot; But he caught it, that brief look in her eyes, and all of his 
years of knowing her let her communicate to him without speaking in that 
moment.

&quot;Oh.&quot; He looked at her, his own eyes widening in disbelief. It made too 
much sense. Understanding hit him like a brick and he felt so stupid for 
having never even suspected it.

&quot;Oh, Ino,&quot; he said again, sympathy in his voice.

It was too much for him and so he reclined back and looked at the 
clouds. She lay down beside him, there in the grass of the yard in front 
of Sakura&#39;s apartment. She curled up next to him, burying her face in 
his shoulder and he just let her. He could feel the shoulder of his 
shirt become damp with her tears. He just let her lay there.

How am I ever going to tell Chouji this?

- - - - - -

It turned out he didn&#39;t need to tell Chouji, after all. Ino accepted 
that task. He walked her home at dusk, pulling her into a final embrace 
before she went in to break the truth to Chouji, the boy who had only 
ever wanted to love her.

&quot;It will be ok, Ino.&quot;

She looked at him then and he saw for the first time how truly exhausted 
she was. How could she not be, with the emotional strain combined with 
training and on top of it all, overusing her jutsu with Sakura. How Ino 
had not collapsed before, he didn&#39;t know.

And then he let her go, his heart torn between her and his best friend, 
who was about to hear the worst news of his life.</pre>
