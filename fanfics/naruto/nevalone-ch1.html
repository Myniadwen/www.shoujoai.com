<h1>Never Have to be Alone</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../naruto/index.html">Naruto</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aseyruun.html">Amelia_Seyruun</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was just a little argument.

&quot;PIG!&quot;

&quot;FOREHEAD GIRL!&quot;

Okay, maybe it was not so little.

There we are, myself and the pink-haired medical nin, who stopped by our 
flower shop. I was not surprised to see her, however, it seemed like she 
was never around without looking all down in the dumps.

Of course she could not stop thinking about Sasuke-kun. But what good 
what it have done if she kept dwelling over him? It was not good for her 
health, and I pointed this out to her.

&quot;Sakura, most of us have moved on without him. You should do the same. 
Keep this up and you&#39;ll end up with wrinkles all over your----&quot;

She snapped at me.

&quot;You think it&#39;s that easy, Ino?! Damn it, you weren&#39;t the one who was on 
the same team with Sasuke-kun!&quot;

I throw my hands up in complete frustration.

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m trying to help. If all you&#39;re going to do is mope around, then 
don&#39;t do it inside our shop!&quot;

&quot;FINE! SEE IF I EVER COME TO YOU FOR SUPPORT AGAIN!&quot;

She stomps herself out.

&quot;YEAH, FINE! AND DON&#39;T BOTHER COMING BACK!&quot;

Watching her leave, I slump down against the counter, heaving a big 
sigh. That was way out of line for me. But I&#39;m not feeling in the mood 
to chase after her.

I close my eyes, and my mind slowly drifts back to when we were kids.

***

Little Sakura is sitting by herself, hugging her knees close to her 
chest, sobbing quietly.

&quot;Not again, Sakura. Did you get picked on again?&quot;

She sniffs, but does not even glance in my direction.

&quot;Why do they always pick on me?&quot;

I shake my head and approach her.

&quot;It&#39;s because you never stand up for yourself. And I can&#39;t always be 
there to back you up.&quot;

She sighs. &quot;It&#39;s because of my stupid large forehead. I should just hide 
somewhere for the rest of my life....I&#39;m sorry.....&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about? And why are you apologizing? I know you&#39;re 
not that weak, Sakura! Take it from me! Until the day comes when you 
fully blossom, don&#39;t hide yourself from the sun! We&#39;ll do it together!&quot;

She wipes her tears away, then finally looks to me, her bright green 
eyes glossing in tears. I reach out and wipe them away, smiling.

&quot;Together, Ino-chan?&quot;

&quot;Yep, together! Always!&quot;

***

I wake up with a start, rubbing my eyes. I knew what I had to do. And 
leaving the shop to my mother, I take off running.

***

&quot;Why am I not surprised to find you here?&quot;

Where do I find her? In the same exact spot where used to cry to 
herself.

She sighs. &quot;Came to tease me again, Ino?&quot;

I pause. &quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to hurt you. It&#39;s just, well, I 
don&#39;t like seeing you sad.&quot;

She looks to me with those same bright green eyes. Her pink hair 
flutters gently against the warm afternoon breeze.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, too, Ino. I shouldn&#39;t have yelled at you. It&#39;s just hard not 
thinking about him.&quot;

I approach her, and offer my hand.

&quot;I&#39;m no Sasuke-kun, but at least, I was able to see something that even 
he was too blind to see.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;A beautiful blossoming flower.&quot;

She blushes, and takes my hand, standing up.

&quot;Let&#39;s go back?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s.&quot;

And I think to myself as we walk back to the shop.

&#39;I&#39;ll never leave you alone, Sakura.&#39; </pre>
