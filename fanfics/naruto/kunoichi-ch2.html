<h1>Kunoichi-Ai (part 2 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../naruto/index.html">Naruto</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/elkat.html">Elkat</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../naruto/kunoichi-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Enter the Women from Yuri no Kuni!

As the two kunoichi reached the village gates, they noticed two exotic 
looking women dressed in a fashion that was alien and unusual to them 
leaving little doubt to them not being their clients. One wore an exotic 
hat over her short brown hair, a sleeveless robe, extending from an 
obi-like sash as loincloth like flaps in the front and back, over 
another garment with long sleeves that surpassed the hand and dangled 
near to her knees, puffy pants that bunched together at the ankle and 
two-toed shoes. The other dressed in a similar manner though her face 
was mostly hidden by a bandana with a veil covered the sides and back of 
her head. She also wore a light weight, flexible armor with vanguards 
the held the ridiculously long sleeves in place and greaves that bunched 
the pants at the knee. Combined with the spear and shield she carried, 
it was clear that the second woman was warrior, most likely the 
bodyguard of the first; the princess.

The kunoichi stared at the couple with awe, forgetting momentarily their 
mission until the warrior looked behind her cautiously, in the direction 
of the wilderness outside of the village. &quot;Forgive us for making you 
wait!&quot; Tenten said, drawing near. As she got closer, she noticed 
something out of place with the women. The princess had a deep tan and 
the air of the soldier, her eyes turning quickly to the weapon master as 
soon she opened her mouth while the warrior seemed rather uncomfortable 
in the armor and slightly frail. However, the kunoichi knew better than 
to point this out and decided to let go.

&quot;We are simply grateful that Konohagakure would aid us in our time of 
need. Besides, we prefer waiting in the village, knowing that we are 
somewhere safe than in the wilderness, where we feel vulnerable,&quot; the 
princess said, she and the warrior bowing to the kunoichi.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry; with the two us around, I doubt the assassin would show 
his face without thinking twice!&quot; Tenten said confidently, she and 
Hinata bowing in return.

&quot;Unfortunately, our comrades said the something on those lines and ended 
being killed by the assassin without having a chance to fight back. You 
can see how such words don&#39;t bring us that much comfort,&quot; the princess 
said in a sad tone.

&quot;Forgive me!&quot; Tenten said blushing in embarrassment. &quot;If the as 
assailant is as good as you say, there&#39;s no doubt it&#39;s a shinobi!&quot;

&quot;Indeed, but do you mind if we continue our conversation on the road? 
We&#39;re anxious to return to our homeland,&quot; The princess said, looking 
towards the warrior.

&quot;Of course! Let&#39;s set out!&quot; Tenten said.

The party began their journey to Yuri no Kuni, unaware that they were 
being observed.

From afar a trio of shadows watched the princess and her escort depart.

&quot;There they go,&quot; said one of the three with a cheerful feminine voice.

&quot;We should attack them when the leave sight of the village,&quot; said 
another of the three with a gloomy feminine voice.

&quot;We can&#39;t kill them right away! Where would the fun be in that?!&quot; the 
first complained.

&quot;If we let them live, we&#39;ll loose our chance!&quot; the second said in 
return.

The third said nothing, but held its forefinger up and brought it to 
where its lips should be before pointing towards the traveling party.

&quot;Yes, cousin!&quot; the first and second said, nodding their heads in 
understanding.

All at once, the three shadowy figures disappeared.

They were nearly out of sight of the village and Tenten found the 
princess&#39;s and the warrior&#39;s solemn silence to be unsettling. Realizing 
she knew not the name of either and unable to bear the silence anymore, 
she spoke up. &quot;Excuse me, but I think we forgot to introduce ourselves. 
I&#39;m Tenten and this Hyuga Hinata,&quot; she said.

&quot;I am Yurihime and this is my bodyguard Yuribuke. Forgive us if we don&#39;t 
stop to bow, but I think it&#39;s more important for us to get as far as we 
can before night sets in,&quot; the princess said in a stressed tone.

What kind fake names are those? Tenten thought, growing agitated with 
the princess&#39;s rather unfriendly and straightforward words. She could 
understand the need for secrecy, the knowledge that a faceless assailant 
could be targeting her would have her suspicious of anybody she didn&#39;t 
know too well, but the princess seemed rather uncomfortable around them.

&quot;If you don&#39;t mind me asking... why are men forbidden?&quot; Hinata asked, 
looking to the women.

At first the kunoichi were afraid the women wouldn&#39;t answer until 
Yurihime spoke up, &quot;It&#39;s because long ago, before the reign of the first 
Yurijo&#39;o, a cruel and sexist Daimyo ruled, ruling all women to be 
treated no better than animals. Any woman that refused to obey him let 
alone their husbands or fathers, were beaten and tortured until their 
will was broken or they died. Any man who spoke against him was publicly 
executed to serve as an example for the rest of them. Life in Yuri no 
Kuni was hell on earth and the women learned to live in disgrace, but 
never forget the pain and suffering they experienced at the hands of 
men.

&quot;Eventually a bold and clever girl whose despise of men was so great 
that she wanted the Daimyo dead began to organize an underground 
resistance, promising that she will make the pay for what he has done. 
She was a clever girl, teaching the women how to drug the drink and food 
that the men without being caught and how to fight! She made an army of 
assassins out of the women, prepared to lay down their life to change 
the land for the future generations. Late one night, just at the turning 
of midnight, she had given the order for the women to begin the coup. 
Though the men of the land were superior warriors, they never expected 
their sisters and wives turn against them. Without shedding a single 
drop of blood, they neutralized the men, stealing from their weapons and 
tying them up. Armed, they gathered together and advanced to the castle. 
They made little work of the guards, distracting them long enough to 
knock them unconscious and tying them up before entering the castle and 
capturing the Daimyo. By the morning, the women brought the men out to 
witness their Daimyo beaten and tortured before being executed for his 
crimes. The men exiled, threatened to suffer the same fate if they were 
caught on ever again setting foot in Yuri no Kuni. From there began the 
rebirth of our country with the girl becoming the first Yurijo&#39;o.&quot;

The kunoichi listened to the story in silence and disbelief.

&quot;Country serves as a safe haven for women who seek absolute seclusion 
from men, allowing the country to thrive on,&quot; Yurohime said.

&quot;I see,&quot; Tenten said... A country where men are forbidden from entering. 
Could that mean...? She thought with a glimmer of hope.

&quot;It&#39;s getting dark...&quot; Yurihime said, looking towards the darkening sky.

The women decided to stop and setup camp, Tenten and Hinata going out to 
scout the nearby area.

&quot;Um, Tenten-sama?&quot; Hinata asked, once they were out of earshot of the 
princess and her bodyguard.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Tenten asked.

&quot;Have you noticed that there&#39;s something, weird, about the Yurihime and 
Yuribuke?&quot;

&quot;Other than obviously made up names? Well I can&#39;t place my finger on it, 
but it seems like there&#39;s something they are keeping from us.&quot; Tenten 
said with a sigh.

&quot;I&#39;m kind of scared,&quot; Hinata said, looking at the ground. &quot;I-I don&#39;t why 
the Hokage chose me to go on this mission! I know that men are forbidden 
from entering their country, but there are far better kunoichi in our 
village that should have been chosen!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not too sure, but I think that the Hokage had chosen you because 
felt that she could rely on you,&quot; Tenten said. &quot;Besides you&#39;re quite 
powerful. I&#39;ve seen what you can do myself!&quot; As she said, she felt great 
sympathy for the Hyuga. She had from her team mate Neji how her own 
father is considering her young sister over her for the leadership of 
the clan. Though she lacked confidence, she was very kind, never trying 
to hurt anybody and able to standup for herself when she needed. Tenten 
remembered back to when the two Hyuga cousins had to fight one another 
in preliminary round before the third Exam. Though Hinata had no chance 
in defeating Neji, she still stood her ground telling him that he 
limited views fate were wrong.

&quot;I, Is something wrong Tenten-sama?&quot; Hinata asked, looking worried.

&quot;Uh, no... I was just thinking!&quot; Tenten said, blushing as she realized 
that she was staring at the girl. &quot;Well it looks like there&#39;s nothing 
dangerous around. We should be heading back.&quot;

&quot;Ok,&quot; Hinata said.

The kunoichi turned about and returned to the camp, not aware of what 
awaited them that night.
