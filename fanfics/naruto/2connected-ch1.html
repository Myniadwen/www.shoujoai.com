<h1>Two Connected Hearts: One Ful of Love, the Other of Revenge (part 1 of 2)</h1>

<pre> &#39;Why did it have to happen like this? Why did he have to die?&#39; Anko 
thought.It had been raining at the Hokage&#39;s funeral. Everyone cried that 
day, even the gods. Anko was at the bar that evening, trying to drink 
away her pain.

 &quot;If only I could have stopped him, none of this would have happened.&quot;  
she whispered to herself.

 &quot;It&#39;s not your fault, Anko. You know that.&quot;  A voice from behind said. 
Kurenai walked around and sat down at the bar next to Anko.

 &quot;You&#39;re strong, you&#39;re one of the strongest konichi in this village, we 
all know that.&quot; Kurenai said in a comforting tone. &quot;But how could you 
expect to defeat him? He&#39;s one of the legendary Sanin. In the end even 
the Hokage couldn&#39;t beat him. You have to stop blaming your-self Anko.&quot; 
Kurenai said in a stern but consoling voice.

 &quot;I was his student. I should have been able to do something at the very 
least.&quot; Anko said.

 &quot;Anko, if it hadn&#39;t been for you it would have been too late to do 
anything.&quot; Kurenai said, trying to comfort her friend.

 &quot;I should have been able to kill him!&quot; Anko shouted angrily.

 The bar became quiet at Anko&#39;s shout. Kurenai stood up and grabbed 
Anko&#39;s hand.

 &quot;Come on Anko, let&#39;s go to my place. We can talk there.&quot;

 Kurenai pulled Anko out of the bar and down the road.</pre>
