<h1>Love and War (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../advancewars/index.html">Advance Wars</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cbois.html">C. Bois</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../advancewars/lovewar-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The day started as any other day, but Sami knew it would be 
different. It said so in her horoscope, not that she believed in all 
that stuff. In fact, the reason she read it that day was that she 
felt that something was going to happen, and the horoscope just 
happened to confirm it. Sami had dressed herself in war attire, 
since she was going to be on the front line that afternoon. The 
morning would be spent getting to the battlefield. Sami was 
excited, but nervous. She didn&#39;t know what this ominous 
feeling meant... good or bad news? She decided to try to forget 
about it, and whatever would happen, would happen.

After a quick breakfast with the Orange Star crew, Sami 
headed off to the escort, being wished good luck by Andy and 
Max. She went outside, and saw that Nell was waiting in the 
jeep, who waved to Sami to move quickly. As soon as Sami 
hopped in the back, the jeep sped off. &quot;What&#39;s the rush?&quot; Sami 
had to yell to Nell to be heard. &quot;Oh the usual, the Black Hole 
forces decided to move ahead early.&quot; Nell replied. 

&quot;Do we still have the mountains?&quot; Sami asked urgently. 

&quot;Yes, but only if we keep moving. Are you fine without 
lunch?&quot;

&quot;I can tough it out.&quot;

&quot;Here, have my apple, you&#39;ll need it more than me.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Nell.&quot; Sami said with a smile. Nell had always been 
considerate like that. She always knew how to help out. Sami 
ate the apple slowly, her mind elsewhere. But her thoughts 
weren&#39;t about the battlefield; she was thinking about all the 
times that Nell had helped her out of tough situations, how she 
probably wouldn&#39;t have survived some battles without Nell.

They arrived at the mobile HQ with time to spare, but Sami 
didn&#39;t stay very long. She quickly gathered the grunts and set 
off for the mountain range. She felt that it was better waiting 
there than at the HQ. Nell stayed at the HQ to watch over the 
battle and give advice to Sami when needed. By this time the 
fog of war had rolled in, and visibility was minimal. Nell 
hoped that everything would work out despite the fog...

Out on the plains, Sami&#39;s troops were moving at a steady pace 
towards the mountains. They were at the foot of the mountain 
that they planned to climb when they suddenly heard the roar 
of an engine. Before any of the soldiers could prepare to attack, 
a recon unit appeared out of the fog and opened fire on Sami&#39;s 
troops as it sped by. The troops attempted to shoot the recon, 
but to no avail. The sound of the recon&#39;s engine died away as it 
sped off to notify Black Hole of the Orange Star forces, while 
the troops were in disarray. Sami called everyone to attention, 
and was told, to her relief, that there weren&#39;t many fatalities, 
but injuries from stray bullets were plenty. Sami decided that 
they should keep moving nonetheless and get to the mountain 
range before stopping to tend to minor injuries.

At last Sami&#39;s regime made it to the top of the mountain. The 
troops all got their med kits out and started helping each other 
tend to their wounds. Sami climbed to the highest point on the 
mountain. She could clearly see the Black Hole forces about 5 
miles away and closing in. The recon unit that they had 
encountered before had already joined the ranks, so Sami&#39;s 
hopeful element of surprise could be forgotten. The view from 
the mountain was a great vantage point, but what she 
couldn&#39;t see was the battleship now moving along the coast far 
out at sea, guarding the troops on the beach...

Nell panicked. Orange Star&#39;s radars had picked up a large 
object out at sea. &quot;Sami! There&#39;s a battleship!&quot; she yelled into 
her two-way radio, and there seemed to be an odd echo in the 
room. Nell turned around to find out that Sami had left her 
radio on the table. 

&quot;SAMI!&quot; She ran out of the HQ, fired up one of the recons, and 
sped off before anyone could say anything to her. &quot;I have to 
reach her; it&#39;s our only hope...&quot; Nell thought as she raced 
through the plains towards the mountains in the distance.

&quot;Okay troops, they&#39;re expecting us, so we&#39;ll just have to destroy 
them quickly and efficiently,&quot; Sami lectured the troops, 

&quot;Everyone clear on what we&#39;re going to do?&quot; But before they 
could answer, they heard gunfire. Sami&#39;s wristband was 
shredded by a bullet, but it only skinned her wrist, leaving a 
small wound. A Black Hole infantry unit had snuck up beside 
them on the mountain range while they were busy with their 
injuries. &quot;Everyone find cover and fire right back at them!&quot; 
Sami found a large rock to hide behind, and quickly loaded 
some rounds into her machine gun. Within seconds she was 
firing at the Black Hole troops. They were defeated within the 
hour, but Sami&#39;s troops didn&#39;t know it was a trap set up by the 
Black Hole group... 

After the battle, Sami told her troops to stay on the mountain 
and defend it if necessary, while she did a quick scan of the 
area. She discovered a cave and followed it through the 
mountain, and it eventually led to the beach, where the Black 
Hole tanks would soon be passing. A new plan formed inside 
her head, but she as Sami began to run back through the cave to 
inform her troops, she heard an unexpected sound. &quot;Oh no...&quot; 
She whispered to herself. She reached the end of the cave, but 
could go no further. The blasts from the battleship had caused a 
cave-in at the mouth of the cave, and she couldn&#39;t get out. She 
couldn&#39;t see that her troops had been demolished, but she knew. 
She sat down in the dark, and felt like crying. This wasn&#39;t 
going right at all...
