<h1>Love and War (part 4 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../advancewars/index.html">Advance Wars</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cbois.html">C. Bois</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../advancewars/lovewar-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Back at the HQ, things were not so peaceful. The Orange Star 
CO team had arrived, wondering what the hell had happened. 
Max was furious. &quot;What the hell was Sami doing?! This&#39;ll set 
us back a long time! How are we supposed to defeat Black 
Hole if we can&#39;t even take out a small scout force?!&quot;

&quot;Max, you really have to settle down. It wasn&#39;t Sami&#39;s fault. 
She was ambushed. We&#39;d all have had the same happen to us, 
maybe worse. Sami&#39;s the infantry specialist.&quot; Andy cut in. Max 
chose to ignore this. 

&quot;And where the hell is Nell when you need her? If they don&#39;t 
get back here within five min-&quot;

&quot;Hey guys...&quot; Sami gloomily said as she entered the room. She 
was covered in dust, and her wrist was lightly stained red from 
her wound. Max immediately settled down when he saw the 
condition she was in. Nell followed closely behind her.

&quot;Sorry, Sami, you know how I get. I&#39;m just frustrated is all.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay Max, I&#39;m frustrated too. I just wanted to let you guys 
know I&#39;m back. I&#39;ll be in my room until I get myself sorted 
out.&quot;

Sami glanced at Nell as she passed by, who gave her a small 
smile. After Sami left, Nell turned to Max. &quot;Max, I need you to 
watch what you say. Sami&#39;s had a tough day, and I doubt you 
can understand the way she feels right now. We&#39;ll discuss what 
we&#39;re going to do about that Black Hole unit later. For now, 
cool your head and find something useful to do.&quot; She turned on 
her heel and left.

&quot;Sheesh, what&#39;s bugging her?&quot; Max said to himself and Andy. 
Andy just gave him an annoyed look.

Knock knock. &quot;Who is it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Nell.&quot;

&quot;Come on in. I&#39;m just cleaning myself up a little.&quot; Nell entered 
the room, shutting the door behind her. She wasn&#39;t surprised to 
see that Sami was in the shower. She felt a rush through her as 
she saw Sami&#39;s naked figure behind the blurred glass, but tried 
to put that thought out of her mind.

&quot;Are you alright Sami?&quot;

&quot;I will be. I just need some time to think things through.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; Nell said as she started to turn back towards the door.

&quot;But don&#39;t go. Please, I need to talk more than I need to think. 
I&#39;ll drive myself crazy if I shut myself up in here.&quot; She turned 
the taps of the shower off. &quot;Could you pass me a towel?&quot;

Nell blushed as she thought of being even closer to Sami, but 
forced herself not to look as she walked over to the shower and 
handed Sami the towel that was sitting on the countertop.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Sami said as she received the towel. &quot;Nell, about... 
before... I don&#39;t really know how to explain...&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t need to. We can forget about it. It was nothing.&quot; 
Nell lied to herself as much as to Sami.

&quot;But that&#39;s not it. It wasn&#39;t nothing. I don&#39;t want it to be 
nothing.&quot; Sami wrapped the towel around herself and stepped 
out of the shower. &quot;I want it to be something, because... I love 
you, Nell.&quot; She blushed as she said the words. Nell had a 
thoughtful look upon her face, and then smiled back at Sami.

&quot;I love you too.&quot;

They didn&#39;t hold back this time. They quickly met with a full-
on kiss, tongues daring enough to explore each other&#39;s mouth. 
Both girls&#39; hands quickly went to the waist-line, pulling each 
other closer together. Nell broke the kiss long enough to look 
into Sami&#39;s eyes and see that they were as playful and 
expectant as she&#39;d hoped. She led Sami over to the bed, and 
slowly brought her hand up to Sami&#39;s shoulders. Both were 
lost in anticipation and excitement as Nell unravelled Sami&#39;s 
towel and let it drop to the floor. 

They sat down on the bed together, and Sami unbuttoned Nell&#39;s 
shirt and removed it. Nell kicked off her heels and brought 
Sami down with a kiss until she was on top of her. She then 
moved downwards, stopping to kiss at the base of Sami&#39;s neck, 
causing her to moan ever so slightly. She then moved on to 
Sami&#39;s breasts, massaging one with her mouth and tongue, 
while gently rubbing the other with her hand. Sami&#39;s breathing 
rate increased, and she moaned a little louder. After she&#39;d had 
her fun with Sami&#39;s breasts, Nell again moved lower. Sami 
gasped and doubled up as Nell&#39;s tongue made contact with her 
clit, but she quickly got used to the feeling. Nell continued to 
lick Sami&#39;s regions before taking it up a notch. Two fingers slid 
easily into Sami as she moaned loudly. Nell continued with her 
tongue and fingers, satisfied that she was pleasing Sami. Sami&#39;s 
moans grew louder with each passing moment. &quot;Oh, Nell! 
MMM Yes!&quot; she cried as she climaxed. Her fluids gushed onto 
the bedsheets, and Nell quickly lapped up the remainder on 
Sami. Sami pulled Nell up and kissed her, the taste of herself 
still strong in Nell&#39;s mouth. 

It was Nell&#39;s turn.

Sami rolled Nell over and sat on top of her, a devilishly playful 
look upon her face. She pulled Nell up for a kiss and removed 
her bra in the process, leaving their breasts in contact. After a 
few minutes of passionate kissing and exploring hands, Sami 
brought Nell down to the bed again. She removed Nell&#39;s skirt, 
leaving her with only her underwear, which was promptly 
removed as well. Sami had her playful look again as she 
positioned herself on Nell and began to rub her clit against 
Nell&#39;s. Nell moaned as the feeling rushed through her body. 
Soon she was moving her body in rhythm with Sami, making it 
even more pleasurable. It didn&#39;t take long before Nell felt her 
body shaking and cried out to Sami. As both she and Sami 
climaxed into one another, Sami collapsed on top of Nell, 
panting hard. 

&quot;That was awesome.&quot; She managed to say, with a wide smile 
across her face. Nell couldn&#39;t help but laugh.

Fin! (Or as a boring person might say, &quot;The end.&quot;)


Endnote: Geez that was long! Just above 3000 words! o.O Ah 
well, hope you had as much fun reading it as I did writing it. I 
was actually thinking of leaving it a lime and not doing the 
finale since it&#39;s such a cute storyline! But my girlfriend 
convinced me to finish it off, so if you didn&#39;t like that part, 
blame her! Haha, j/k! But yeah, if enough people like this one 
then I might consider writing a sequel and throw in Rachel or 
something. XD The only reason I wouldn&#39;t normally is because 
my head hurts from staring at the computer for 4 hours straight 
writing this one. It ended up being way different than what I 
originally planned, so I had to change the summary a bit to fit 
the story. All&#39;s well that ends well, and this ends very well! I&#39;ll 
leave it at that. Thanks for reading! ;)
