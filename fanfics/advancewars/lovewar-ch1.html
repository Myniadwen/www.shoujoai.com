<h1>Love and War (part 1 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../advancewars/index.html">Advance Wars</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cbois.html">C. Bois</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Introduction: Alright! My first fanfic! This is the only Advance 
Wars fanfic that I know of, which is the main reason why I 
decided to write it. Why I chose Sami and Nell over the rest of 
the girls, well, I think you know why. ;) Also, just in case you 
were wondering who Rachel is, she&#39;s Nell&#39;s sister, from DS. I 
have a feeling that not all Advance Wars fans have the DS, and 
this fanfic is placed a few months after that storyline. I tried not 
to spoil the ending of the game for the people who haven&#39;t 
played it, but there&#39;s a small part that gives away a bit, so if you 
want to be an AWDS virgin when you start playing the game, 
skip over that part! :P 

Anyways, get to reading and enjoy! XD

&quot;Alright everyone, listen up!&quot;

Everyone in the room turned to look at Nell. They knew it was 
something important when she spoke commandingly.

&quot;I&#39;d like to congratulate you guys, especially Max and Andy, 
on a job well done. You handled those Black Hole forces well.&quot; 
Andy and Max grinned at the compliment, and gave each other 
a high-five, whooping. &quot;But, once again, Black Hole has found 
a way to route our forces nearby, and I need to discuss what 
we&#39;re going to do.&quot;

Nell turned the tabletop map display on, and grabbed her 
pointer stick. The map flickered and glowed, showing where 
the enemy and ally units were. Nell continued with her 
explanation, &quot;It looks like they have a small infantry and tank 
force heading up the coastline, and we have an even smaller 
mech group nearby. There are mountain ranges near the coast, 
which we can use to our advantage,&quot; she said, pointing to a 
place on the map, &quot;It gets fairly foggy in this region, but that 
won&#39;t affect us much if we can situate ourselves up on the 
mountains. Now that everyone has seen the situation, I&#39;m sure 
that we can all agree that this would be best handled by Sami.&quot; 
The occupants of the room all nodded their heads in agreement, 
Sami smiling at the chance for some action. She was glad she&#39;d 
be able to get out there and fight, since the last few battles were 
mostly vehicles and she wasn&#39;t able to help out.

&quot;Piece of cake, Nell.&quot; Sami smiled and winked. Nell smiled 
and turned back to everyone at the conference table. &quot;Now I 
want everyone to get some rest and relax for the moment. 
We&#39;ve got a big journey ahead of us.&quot;  As the group began to 
turn and walk away, Nell called &quot;Sami, I need to discuss 
tomorrow&#39;s plans further with you.&quot; Sami walked towards Nell, 
who motioned for her to follow. They passed through several 
well-lit hallways of the HQ, eventually ending up in Nell&#39;s  
room.

&quot;What more is there to discuss, Nell?&quot; Sami inquired playfully. 
She had a feeling that Nell didn&#39;t want to discuss battles in her 
own room. Nell sat down on her couch and flicked on the t.v., 
smiling at Sami, &quot;Sorry to mislead you, I just wanted to hang 
out for a bit. We haven&#39;t had much of a chance to in the past 
few weeks.&quot; Sami nodded and sat down on the couch beside 
Nell. 

&quot;So how are Rachel and everyone doing in Omega Land?&quot; she 
asked. Nell replied, &quot;Well, the situation is looking better every 
day. Jake is a little upset that Hawke is still missing, but they 
all know he&#39;s helping out with the regeneration of life there. 
Rachel&#39;s helping to fix up the towns that were damaged in the 
war, and it&#39;s all going quite smoothly.&quot; Sami was lost in 
thought for a moment before stating, &quot;After the way we 
defeated Black Hole in Omega Land, I&#39;m surprised there were 
still some followers of Von Bolt left over...&quot; Nell nodded in 
agreement, &quot;Yeah, Black Hole always manages to surprise us 
with something out of the blue like that.&quot;

They quietly watched the t.v. for a while, feeling quite 
comfortable on the black leather couch. As the soap opera they 
were watching reached a romantic point, Nell asked Sami if 
she should get her hair cut shorter, like Rachel&#39;s. 

&quot;NO!&quot; Sami shouted, and immediately regretted it. &quot;I mean... I 
love your hair, er... I mean, I like it... long... like that...&quot; She 
stuttered, flushing red from embarrassment. Nell looked at 
Sami funny, and then laughed. &quot;Okay, if you&#39;re sure I 
shouldn&#39;t.&quot; Sami just nodded, unable to speak. A single thought 
flashed through both of their minds, &quot;What was that all 
about...?&quot;
