<h1>Complications (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gokusen/index.html">Gokusen</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;A new teacher?&quot; Kumiko Yamaguchi, also known as Yankumi, asked as she 
looked up from her desk in the staff room, her black hair tied back in a 
pony tail. The red and white sweatsuit she wore didn&#39;t exactly 
compliment her figure, but the glasses wearing woman was still clearly 
female.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the vice principal said sourly, &quot;another woman, miss Haruka 
Nishigushi.&quot; Goro Sawatari peered at her from under his safety helmet, 
&quot;You might want to watch out for her, since she doesn&#39;t know the ropes.&quot;

&quot;I suppose so,&quot; Kumiko conceded, frowning slightly. The name seemed 
oddly familiar to her, but somehow she couldn&#39;t place it.

&quot;Another woman?&quot; Shizuka Fujiyama blinked, the busty woman frowning a 
bit once Goro had left, &quot;I don&#39;t want another rival.&quot;

&quot;Trust me,&quot; Kumiko smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;m no competition.&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Shizuka smiled wryly. She looked up at the clock and innocently 
asked, &quot;When did he say she&#39;d arrive?&quot;

&quot;Pretty soon,&quot; Kumiko agreed as she got up, the slim young woman heading 
out of the staff room and up to the front doors.

As Kumiko walked up the hall the doors opened and a woman strode in, a 
stylish yet sedate dress hugging her body. Unlike Kumiko she had 
generous curves, though thankfully not quite in Shizuka&#39;s league. She 
looked up, sandy brown hair falling into her eyes as she met Kumiko&#39;s 
gaze and both of them froze.

&#39;Now I know where I knew that name,&#39; Kumiko thought to herself warily, 
&#39;she&#39;s the heiress to the rival Nishigushi yakuza group!&#39;

Haruka looked almost as stunned to see Kumiko, but both women recovered 
fairly. &quot;Hello, you must be a teacher here,&quot; Haruka smiled warmly, &quot;I&#39;m 
Haruka Nishigushi.&quot;

&quot;Kumiko Yamaguchi,&quot; she managed to keep her tone of voice relatively 
normal, &quot;it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you.&quot; The two women fell into step as 
they went down the hall, &quot;It seems I&#39;ll be showing you around....&quot;

Within a few minutes Kumiko summarized the three informal rules of 
school survival: Dress in clothes that gave unrestricted movement; 
Always travel in groups; and Never turn your back on a delinquent. As 
well she showed the new writing teacher around the school, including her 
new classroom and the students she&#39;d be doing home room with.

&quot;Thank you very much,&quot; Haruka said warmly as a group of students passed 
by, ogling the pretty older woman. She hesitated then asked quietly, 
&quot;Miss Yamaguchi, is there somewhere we can talk in private?&quot;

Kumiko gave her a thoughtful look then she nodded, &quot;Yes, I think so.&quot; 
With that she strode off down the hall to the stairways up, finally 
heading out on the school&#39;s roof.

Shin Sawada jerked in surprise as Kumiko and the other teacher emerged 
into the sunlight, the young man casually sitting in the shade. &quot;Hey, 
Yankumi, what&#39;s up?&quot; he asked, his red hair falling around his face.

&quot;I need the roof for awhile,&quot; Kumiko said firmly as she swept the other 
students sitting around up there, &quot;you and the others, get back to 
class.&quot;

&quot;But Miss Yankumi,&quot; Kuma started to protest.

Kumiko gave them all a dangerous look, the kind of look she usually 
reserved for Yakuza business. &quot;I need the roof,&quot; she repeated coldly 
adding, &quot;and right now.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Shin quickly realized that she was deadly serious and collected 
his friends, rushing them all off the roof.

Haruka turned to Kumiko, her expression pained, &quot;I truly didn&#39;t realize 
the heir to the Oedo clan would be here.&quot;

Kumiko studied Haruka with a cold expression on her face, the sort she&#39;d 
only wear in dealing with a fellow yakuza. &quot;So why are you here?&quot; she 
asked pointedly.

&quot;It&#39;s a long story,&quot; Haruka sighed then began to tell it.

As the woman talked Kumiko&#39;s look softened somewhat and soon she was 
leaning on the fence surrounding the roof and listening eagerly. &quot;Let me 
get this straight,&quot; she finally said, &quot;the leader of your group wants to 
marry you off and you&#39;ve run away?&quot;

&quot;I left with my parents permission,&quot; Haruka carefully stressed that 
point, &quot;they&#39;re also against the marriage.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t say I blame them,&quot; Kumiko admitted thoughtfully, &quot;I&#39;ve met your 
future husband Fuji Hajima and he&#39;s a pig.&quot; She looked at Haruka, &quot;But 
will hiding out here be enough?&quot;

&quot;I just need to stay under cover until the wedding day,&quot; Haruka smiled 
bravely as she asked, &quot;how hard can it be?&quot;

Kumiko sighed as she lead the way over to the door to the stairs and 
back to their duties as teachers, &quot;You have no idea.&quot;

Despite Kumiko&#39;s instinctive misgivings things were quiet at Shirokin 
Gakuin Senior High School, or at least as quiet as they ever got. There 
were several aborted gang turf wars that were averted by Kumiko, and 
several of the students picked up the same sort of vibe around Haruka as 
they had around Kumiko.

Personally, Kumiko was rather surprised at how well the two of them got 
along. It was so nice to have someone else around who got the unusual 
point of view of someone raised in the yakuza. She didn&#39;t have to 
explain her amusement at the kids&#39; antics or her worries about the boys 
falling into a yakuza lifestyle, Haruka got it without a word being 
spoken.

&quot;Yankumi,&quot; Shin asked quietly as they watched the now casually track 
suited woman leaving the school grounds, &quot;is she yakuza too?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not my secret to tell,&quot; Kumiko answered honestly, her eyes drawn 
to the way the pretty blonde moved. She forced herself to look away from 
her, instead seeing Shin&#39;s amused gaze. &quot;What?&quot; she asked crossly.

&quot;You like her?&quot; Shin asked quietly.

&quot;We&#39;re friends,&quot; Kumiko said, but felt a slight blush color her cheeks.

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Shin smiled. He looked up with a frown as a black limo 
pulled up to the curve nearby Haruka, rough men climbing out to encircle 
her. &quot;Teach...,&quot; he started warningly.

&quot;Shit,&quot; Kumiko reflexedly ran forward even as a yakuza tried to grab at 
Haruka and he got punched in the face instead.

&quot;You bitch,&quot; he cursed, &quot;you&#39;ll pay for....&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll pay you in full,&quot; Kumiko yelled as she punched him in the throat, 
silencing him instantly, &quot;with interest!&quot;

&quot;What the hell?&quot; a yakuza with big shoulders and lots of muscle managed 
to yelp as Shin tackled him, sending him reeling off balance. Haruka 
followed up with a rabbit punch to the face, dropping the second as the 
remaining two charged forward.

&quot;Boys, this is a very bad idea,&quot; Kumiko warned them both.

Haruka nodded as she said harshly, &quot;Your simple snatch and grab just got 
public, and I can bet you someone in the school called the cops.&quot;

The two men seemed smarter than most as they grabbed their partners and 
hustled them into the cars. &quot;Mr. Hajima knows where you are,&quot; the 
tallest fellow scowled as he leavered a unconscious man into the limo, 
&quot;you can&#39;t hide any more.&quot;

As the car roared off Shin brushed himself off as he asked wryly, &quot;Do I 
want to know what that was all about?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s probably safer if you don&#39;t know,&quot; Kumiko said to him simply 
before adding, &quot;but thanks for the help.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Shin nodded before walking back to the school 
building.

Kumiko hurried over to Haruka&#39;s side even as she mentally noted the 
limo&#39;s licence plates. &#39;Probably stolen, but you never know,&#39; she 
thought as she asked her intently, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

&quot;I think so,&quot; Haruka answered, &quot;just pissed.&quot; She kicked out at the wall 
angrily, her eyes narrowed, &quot;How dare they...?!&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re getting desperate,&quot; Kumiko answered, helping support Haruka as 
she slumped against her.
