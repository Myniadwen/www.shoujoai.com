<a href="../gokusen/complications-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;They&#39;re getting desperate,&quot; Kumiko Yamaguchi said grimly as she gently 
wrapped a arm around Haruka&#39;s shoulders.

Haruka Nishigushi leaned her body against Kumiko, glad to finally let 
someone else be strong. Only a few weeks ago if she had imagined herself 
in the arms of her family&#39;s rival she would have laughed, but now it 
felt strangely right being held by the other woman....

&#39;What am I doing?&#39; Haruka made herself straighten up as she firmly 
reminded herself, &#39;She&#39;s only being a friend to me.&#39; She took a nervous 
breath then looked up at Kumiko, &quot;What do you think they&#39;ll do next?&quot;

Kumiko pressed her lips together, her expression serious as she said, 
&quot;They have to get you to the wedding or they&#39;ll lose face. This isn&#39;t 
the last time they&#39;ll try to take you.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I thought,&quot; Haruka sighed her agreement, &quot;so I can&#39;t 
continue to come here.&quot; She saw Kumiko&#39;s questioning look and continued, 
&quot;It&#39;s too exposed, and I can&#39;t endanger the students....&quot;

Kumiko nodded grimly, &quot;That&#39;s true. Do you have someplace to go where 
Hajima can&#39;t find you?&quot;

&quot;I think I can find someplace,&quot; Haruka answered, her mind racing. &#39;I 
can&#39;t go to my usual family hide outs, so where...?&#39;

Kumiko&#39;s black hair blew around her face as she pushed it back and 
asked, &quot;Would you accept a suggestion?&quot;

Haruka smiled back slightly as she worriedly asked her, &quot;Depends, will 
this get you into trouble?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s life without a little trouble?&quot; Kumiko laughed.

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;This is a very bad idea,&quot; Haruka said firmly not long after as they 
stood outside of the headquarters of the Ooedo clan.

&quot;No, it&#39;s a very good one,&quot; Kumiko answered firmly as they walked 
towards the door. She smiled slightly, &quot;Hajima would have to be crazy to 
attack the clan, and more importantly we can ask Grandfather for 
advice.&quot;

&quot;Is he as scary as they say he is?&quot; Haruka joked with Kumiko quietly as 
they took their shoes off at the door. She looked around, taking in a 
beautifully laid out residence, with neat hallways and a carefully cared 
for interior.

&quot;It depends,&quot; Kumiko smiled, &quot;he&#39;s a sweety, but don&#39;t cross him.&quot;

Haruka gulped, thinking of her own grandfather. &#39;I hope they&#39;re not too 
alike,&#39; she mused as she was lead down the hall.

A tall, dark haired man slid open a door as he called, &quot;Boss, I heard 
you come in....&quot; He saw Haruka and stiffened, his eyes narrowing as soon 
as he saw her, &quot;What&#39;s one of the damn Nishigushi doing here?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s my guest,&quot; Kumiko growled, her eyes flashing in a way that made 
Haruka&#39;s heart race a bit.

The man paled, &quot;Sorry, Boss.&quot;

&#39;She&#39;s so in control,&#39; Haruka thought as the man nearly fled, &#39;but they 
respect her, too. I wish I could do that.&#39; As they resumed walking she 
quietly said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m causing you any trouble.&quot;

&quot;Having my whole clan troop down to the principal&#39;s office to protest my 
preformance review was trouble,&quot; Kumiko said wryly, &quot;this isn&#39;t so bad.&quot;

Imagining that Haruka had to laugh, softly. &quot;They must care about you 
very much,&quot; she noted, smiling as Kumiko blushed.

&quot;Yeah, well,&quot; Kumiko mumbled as she knocked on the door. &quot;Grandfather,&quot; 
she called, &quot;could we speak with you?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; the voice called, &quot;come in.&quot;

Kumiko&#39;s grandfather was a kindly looking sort, rather unlike his 
reputation. His once dark hair was streaked with grey and there were 
many smile lines on his face, but he carried his age well. Only the 
shadows under his eyes and a trembling hand showed he had been ill, and 
it seemed he was on the road to recovery.

&quot;Would you like some tea?&quot; the older man asked politely once he heard 
them out, his expression thoughtful.

&quot;Let me get it,&quot; Haruka volunteered, getting up to gracefully pour the 
green tea into the old style cups. She wasn&#39;t a expert on tea ceremony 
but she tried to bring a certain amount of style to the sharing of tea.

Waiting until Haruka was busy with the tea grandfather asked Kumiko, 
&quot;How far are you willing to go to help her?&quot;

Kumiko gave him a questioning look, &quot;She&#39;s my friend....&quot;

A smile teased his lips as he nodded, &quot;I see.&quot;

Haruka set each cup down, then settled down on her feet as she gave each 
a chance to drink. Sipping her own cup she set it down as she murmured, 
&quot;Thank you for hearing us out. Even if you can&#39;t help, it&#39;s been good to 
set things out clearly.&quot;

Drinking his tea grandfather smiled slightly. &quot;Actually, I think there 
may be a solution to your problem,&quot; he admitted, &quot;but you may not like 
it.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s hear it,&quot; Kumiko smiled at him warmly as she added, &quot;the worst 
that can happen is we&#39;ll refuse to do it.&quot;

A few moments after he explained his idea Haruka was blushing fiercely, 
looking down at her tea cup shyly. &#39;How did he know how much I like 
Kumiko?&#39; she thought wildly.

&quot;There&#39;s no way the Nishigushi family would accept it,&quot; Kumiko said, but 
she sounded more thoughtful than anything else.

Grandfather actually smirked, &quot;They&#39;d have to accept it. Even better, 
it&#39;d infuriate the head of the Nishigushi clan.&quot;

Haruka felt the blush still staining her cheeks as she looked at Kumiko 
and shyly said, &quot;I don&#39;t object to the idea.&quot;

Kumiko scratched her cheek, &quot;I can&#39;t say I object, either.&quot; She looked 
over at her grandfather, &quot;Can you help make the arrangements?&quot;

He smiled, &quot;I have a old friend who can do it, I think.&quot;

After politely excusing themselves Kumiko and Haruka walked together 
down to Kumiko&#39;s rooms, the two women oddly quiet. &quot;Thank you for doing 
this,&quot; she said as they went into the room.

Kumiko put a hand on Haruka&#39;s arm as she tried to be comforting, &quot;It&#39;s 
just for show, anyway. This will convince your Grandfather to leave you 
alone and frighten off Hajima, too.&quot;

Haruka looked at Kumiko thoughtfully a moment, her eyes almost sad. 
&quot;Does it have to be for show?&quot; she asked quietly.

Kumiko looked a bit startled but recovered quickly. &quot;Haruka,&quot; she 
blushed, &quot;I... like you a lot, but I&#39;ve never....&quot;

Haruka nodded as she took a deep breath, summoned up her courage and 
said, &quot;I understand, but I feel closet to you than anyone I&#39;ve ever 
met.&quot;

There was a tenderness in Kumiko&#39;s eyes too as she nodded, &quot;Me, too.&quot;

Haruka took a step closer, looking up at her searching for welcome in 
her eyes. Seeing it Haruka put her hands on Kumiko&#39;s shoulders, leaned 
close and kissed her lingeringly.</pre>
