<h1>Homecoming</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../soranowoto/index.html">Sora no Woto</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/museless.html">Museless</a><br> </h2>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS"><i>&quot;I will always be here. 
So wherever you are, you have a place to return to.&quot;</i></font> <br>
 <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">A lone falcon circled lazily in 
the vast sky above, it&#39;s cry echoing and amplified by the mountains 
beyond the verdant plains. Rio Kazumiya&#39;s grey eyes fluttered open. 
Her lips edged upwards in a smile as the words of Captain Felicia Heideman 
echoed in her ears. It had been years since Felicia uttered those words 
to her, while looking at the younger members of 1121<sup>st</sup> platoon 
as they crossed the bridge connecting Clocktower Fortress to the rest 
of Seize.  Six years in fact. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">It wasn&#39;t the first time she thought 
of those words,and of Felicia. Lately her mind wandered over them more 
often. She thought of Clocktower Fortress in the stillness of dawn as 
the sun entered the azure sky, the blinding star following the trail 
from the day before. The poignant sound of the trumpet as it filled 
the air. Daily life as everyone went about their routines. The content 
faces of the citizens of Seize. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">While the rest of the world fought 
for dominance, Rio decided she would fulfill her dream and search for 
the reborn sea. It had been tough at first and there was still a long 
way to go but thanks to her hard work humans could now soar into the 
sky just like the sounds issued from her trumpet.  </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">&#39;<i>A dream is an excellent thing 
to have,</i>&#39; she mused to herself. A leaf from the tree overhead  
floated downwards, pulled by gravity but taking its time nonetheless. 
She watched its progress until it landed in the grass where she laid 
stretched out, her arms folded under her head. <i>&#39;A home is also nice 
to return to.&#39;</i> The corner of her lips went up a notch at that thought. 
She looked up past the branches filled with flourishing leaves into 
the cerulean sky beyond. The clouds drifted by languidly and would have 
encouraged sleep had she been tired. </font> <br> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">She couldn&#39;t sleep however. There 
was still had a half day&#39;s worth of travel before she reached her destination. 
Eagerness prevented her from relaxing. Anticipation curled in her belly, 
giving her a restless and wild feeling. Sitting up, she stretched her 
arms under the cool shade of the tree. It was time to get going. Straddling 
the sun warmed leather seat of the old two wheeled machine, she turned 
the ignition, eliciting a loud rumble that echoed in the green fields 
surrounding her. Her trumpet, tied on top of the rest of her bags gleamed 
in the midday sun. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">-x-x-x-</font> <br>
 <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">A small animal seem to flip and 
flop in her belly as she neared the entrance to town. It would be folly 
to think that no one would recognize her as she passed through on the 
way to Clocktower Fortress. She smiled and waved back as the people 
of Seize waved at her. Not much had changed while she was gone. Everyone 
looked a little older but everything looked the same. A window display 
of delicate wares beckoned her as she turned a corner. Slowly coming 
to a stop, she parked the motorbike and lifted her goggles. </font> <br>
 <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">So 
you&#39;ve come back.&quot; A stranger might have deemed the voice unfriendly 
but Rio smiled  as she caught the fondness laced between the words. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Naomi-san!&quot; 
She stepped into the doorway where the older woman stood. Rio was not 
given to affectionate gestures but it had been too many years since 
she&#39;d seen the woman.   Pulling Naomi into a hug she chuckled 
when the woman spoke. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">So 
you haven&#39;t forgotten this old woman, hmm?&quot; She pulled back, looking 
Rio in the eye before taking the rest of her in. Rio always carried 
herself in a confident manner but she seemed even more so.  Yes, 
Rio Kazumiya had certainly grown into a fine woman, Naomi thought to 
herself, Princess Iliya would have been proud to call her sister. </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">You&#39;re 
on your way there, aren&#39;t you?&quot; She answered her own question as 
Rio gazed around the shop. &quot;Of course you are.&quot; </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Yes. 
They don&#39;t know.&quot; Rio answered, setting down an intricately crafted 
glass item, suddenly impatient to be on her way. Naomi sensed this, 
the smile on her lips reaching her eyes as she looked at the young woman.</font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Get 
going then.&quot; </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Not ones to mince words, they 
said their goodbyes, Rio striding to the bike as a few passing townsfolk 
looked on curiously. It was definitely the same feeling, Rio decided, 
passing through the quiet streets. Just like the first time she arrived. 
A feeling of nostalgia bubbling up within her, this place was the closest 
thing she had ever felt to a home since her mother passed away all those 
years ago.  </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">She took in the view from the 
bridge as she crossed slowly, the sky alight with golden notes from 
the sun as it bade the world goodnight. She couldn&#39;t help but think 
of the last time she saw the sunset from the bridge. It was the two 
of them, out for one last quiet stroll before Rio left. As the sun sank 
below the horizon, Rio had taken Felicia&#39;s hand in her own, allowing 
their clasped hands to say everything they could not in that particular 
moment. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">She felt a little shy now that 
she was practically there. She laughed at herself, as she realized how 
much of a hurry she had been in earlier as opposed to the hesitancy 
she felt now. Accelerating, she made a decision to race the sun,wanting 
to reach the door before the light disappeared, wanting to see the last 
rays on Felicia&#39;s face.   </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">She pulled into the courtyard 
noticing the stillness once she cut off the engine. A figure stood at 
the door, the golden hair highlighted with glints of red due to the 
sunset. Reflecting light flashed on lenses, hiding the kindest pair 
of blue eyes Rio had ever known. The smile was recognizable as ever. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I 
thought it might be Claus-san.&quot; The voice stated softly as Rio 
removed her goggles and helmet, carefully placing them on the seat. 
She smiled as she made her way up the short steps to the blonde. She 
was finally here and she couldn&#39;t think of one thing to say to the other 
woman. Her throat closed up as the emotions rose up , overpowering her. </font> <br>
 <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Felicia spread her arms, a welcoming 
smile on her face. Rio stumbled into them, tightly wrapping the other 
woman in an embrace. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Welcome 
home, Rio.&quot; </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Felicia.&quot; 
Not knowing what else to say and how else to say it, she choked out 
the name.   Inhaling the woman&#39;s clean scent, she thought 
to herself &#39;<i>Like fresh sunshine soaked linen. I&#39;ve missed this.&#39;</i></font> 
<br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Staying true to her character, 
Felicia merely smiled. The completeness she felt at seeing Rio again 
confirmed what she felt for the woman. All the years she waited, she 
knew Rio would return. She would eventually find out if the somewhat 
gruff but charming woman felt the same way. But that could wait. Felicia 
Heideman was patient woman after all. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Shall 
we have dinner? I made more than enough for two.&quot; Rio&#39;s stomach 
gurgled in response, oddly convenient with the timing. Felicia grinned, 
gently tugging Rio into the kitchen. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">-x-x-x-</font> <br>

 <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">She settled into the bathtub, 
the splashing sounds of water echoing against the walls steeped in silence. 
The lack of noise was redolent of the end of the world, a world devoid 
of life, of man. She found she did not mind it so much tonight. Not 
when she knew Felicia was just beyond the door, humming while putting 
away the leftovers. She sighed in contentment. After the long days of 
travel a hot bath felt especially good to her weary bones. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">During dinner, the blonde informed 
her about the absence of the younger members of the platoon. Noel and 
Kanata had set off in search of an elusive spare part for Takemikazuchi 
with a visiting Aisha in tow. It took Kureha some convincing before 
she decided to go off with them to the neighboring town of Treize. Rio 
imagined Felicia sending them off with her blessing, a happy smile on 
her face. The captain&#39;s blatant disregard for conventional military 
practice seemed to gain her greater respect and admiration, not just 
from her platoon members but the entire town of Seize as well. The door 
opened and the entry of Felicia in a bare towel startled Rio mid-ponder.  </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Not missing a beat, the blonde 
blithely explained with a smile, &quot;We&#39;ll save some hot water if 
I bathed now.&quot; Rio nodded in response, &quot;Of course.&quot; </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Felicia climbed into the tub, 
settling in she exclaimed, &quot;oh my! Isn&#39;t this nice!&quot; The blue 
haired woman chuckled. It wasn&#39;t the first time they had shared a bath 
but there was subtle difference now between the two of them. Perhaps 
it was because they were the only ones in the entire fortress. Or maybe 
it was because it was finally time to solve the mystery between them. 
Whatever it was made anticipation swirl in Rio&#39;s stomach, causing her 
to tense up. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">The tub was large enough to hold 
four people but suddenly it felt quite small. Rio shot covert glances 
at Felicia, noticing the woman&#39;s flawless pale skin, flaxen haired piled 
atop her head, the curves usually hidden under the green uniform. The 
shrewd blonde seemed unconcerned with sharing the bath and more interested 
in getting clean. Rio looked down into the water, gazing at the distorted 
view of the lower half of her body without really seeing. Felicia spoke, 
breaking the silence and her head jolted up, meeting the other woman&#39;s 
amused blue eyes.   </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Shall 
I wash your back?&quot;  She wasn&#39;t expecting the offer and found 
herself blushing furiously. She hoped the steam from the bath hid her 
flush.  </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">N-no, 
it&#39;s alright. I&#39;m done anyway.&quot; She stumbled out of the room quickly, 
cursing herself and her cowardice all the way to her room while wrapped 
in nothing but a towel. She had a feeling Felicia would be wearing the 
same amused look on her face.  The blonde woman had the tendency 
of wearing a smile that seemed to say &#39;I know a secret&#39; and it was one 
of the things that made her seem so mysterious to the rest of the platoon.  </font> <br>
 <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Wasting no time in getting dressed, 
Rio dried her hair. The blonde woman still occupied her thoughts. She 
wondered if the other woman completed her bath. She pictured Felicia 
immersed in the tub, skin shimmering with wetness and gulped. After 
all this time she underestimated her desire for the other woman. In 
a way distance had helped but since she returned she found herself floundering. 
Every smile, look or word from Felicia was slowly drowning her. She 
wanted to let go, and take Felicia in her arms but she held herself 
back. Not for the older woman&#39;s sake but for her own.  </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Exasperation peppered the muttered 
curse as she threw the towel she used to dry her hair. She needed some 
fresh air and her feet unconsciously followed the path upwards. A light 
breeze hit her the moment she stepped out the door and onto the parapet 
of the clock tower. Faint lights from Seize gleamed in the distance 
but made poor competitors to the stars shining above. She took in the 
sight, her mind cleared for a moment. The thought crossed her mind on 
how good it felt to be back again. The view could stay the same forever 
and she&#39;d never get tired of it. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Memories from nights long gone 
floated past. Nights she could not sleep, spent staring at the stars. 
Somehow Felicia always knew when she was awake and would appear with 
cups of tea. Wordlessly, with a hint of a smile and a twinkle in her 
eye she&#39;d give one to Rio and sip from the other. They passed many nights 
that way, Rio&#39;s fears and concerns overlaid  with silence and her 
inability to voice them. Felicia merely sat, casually, her presence 
a comfort for the wordless Rio until the words spilled themselves out 
into the darkness. The captain would listen, nodding. The kind smile 
never left her lips and through it Rio bared her soul, feeling lighter 
as every word departed her body. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">It struck her then. Felicia. Waiting. 
Felicia always waiting, with a kind word and gentle smile. And here 
she was running away again. All because she couldn&#39;t face her own feelings. 
She was afraid the older woman would reject her. It was the idea that 
there might be a rejection. They had formed a family, Felicia, Noel, 
Kureha, Kanata and herself. The fear she might lose this family of hers 
manifested itself. She struck out against the wall, her hand smarting 
with the impact. She had been running away while Felicia patiently stood, 
waiting for her. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Stupid. 
I&#39;m so stupid!&quot; </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I 
disagree.&quot; Felicia said appearing with two cups of tea. &quot;I 
had a feeling you would be up here.&quot; The wind caressed her hair, 
the golden strands trailing in the air.  </font> <br> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Rio chuckled wryly. &quot;I guess 
we&#39;re back to the same old tricks.&quot; She sipped on the tea and sighed. 
The tiny lights from the town captured her gaze and she didn&#39;t look 
away. She couldn&#39;t bring herself to look at Felicia after the epiphany. 
Shame washed through her. Rio was able to stop a war but couldn&#39;t bring 
herself to admit her love to the woman standing next to her. What kind 
of soldier was she? </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">As if following Rio&#39;s internal 
monologue, Felicia answered, &quot;You&#39;re a good soldier. You care about 
people. You do things your way without compromising your ideals. You&#39;re 
a brave woman, Rio Kazumiya. I admire that about you.&quot;  She 
smiled widely, continuing. &quot;But stupid? Never.&quot; </font> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Rio gulped and turned to face 
Felicia. The silvery moonlight brought an ethereal glow to the woman&#39;s 
skin.  She stared and Felicia fidgeted. She couldn&#39;t recall Rio 
ever looking at her that intensely before. </font> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Felicia, 
I&#39;m surprised you don&#39;t hate me already.&quot; Surprise registered on 
the blonde woman&#39;s face. </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Hate 
you? Why would I do such a thing?&quot; She took the cup from Rio and 
along with her own balanced them on the ledge of the parapet. Wrapping 
her arms about Rio, she sighed. The blue haired woman&#39;s gruff voice 
softly replied in her ear. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">I 
made you wait so long.&quot; Rio&#39;s voice shook as her hands came around 
Felicia, completing the hug. &quot;I kept running away while you waited 
patiently. I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;  </font> <br> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Rio could practically see the 
smile in Felicia&#39;s voice as the woman replied. &quot;You&#39;re here now, 
that&#39;s all that matters to me.&quot; They kissed. It was inevitable, 
slow and sweet, the first of many. Without a word they left the parapet 
down to the captain&#39;s quarters. Hands shook, skin heated and blood rushed. 
Soft passion-filled gasps were uttered. Rio made sure to express all 
the things she was unable to say with her actions. They fell asleep 
spent, but not before three little important words were mentioned.  </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">-x-x-x-</font> <br>
 <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">The sun was already up when her 
eyes opened. She felt the warm figure of Felicia pressed against her 
own under the thin sheet.  The door opened, bringing her attention 
to chuckles and gasps. She looked toward the opening, freezing as she 
spotted the faces of Kanata, Kureha, Noel and a blushing Aisha. </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Rio-&quot; 
An excited Kanata was on the verge of barging into the room but not 
before Kureha slapped a palm over the enthusiastic girl&#39;s mouth and 
dragged her off. Noel looked at Rio seriously then nodded before closing 
the door. Rio looked down, letting out a sigh. How were they going to 
explain this to the rest of the platoon? A wry grin appeared and soft 
laughter bubbled forth. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Felicia stirred and pulled Rio 
close, a sleepy murmur issuing from her, &quot;What&#39;s all the racket 
about?&quot; </font> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">Rio smiled down at the drowsy 
woman beside her. &quot;I think we&#39;ve been found out...&quot; </font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Trebuchet 
MS">Oh? 
Is that all?&quot; </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">They smiled at each other as notes 
from Kanata&#39;s bugle rend the skies over Clocktower Fortress and the 
town of Seize. </font></p>
