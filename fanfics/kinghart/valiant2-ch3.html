<h1>Valiant Hearts II (part 3 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kinghart/index.html">Kingdom Hearts</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yuritale.html">Yuritale</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kinghart/valiant2-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><P>The sun
had just risen over the town and it was still chilly out from the
morning mist. While most of the townspeople were still sleeping, two
in particular were already awake and preparing to leave the town.</P><P>A blond girl stood 
behind a window inside a mansion. The sun shone
into the room, quietly bathing it in warm sunlight. She wore just a
plain white dress, sandals, and had her hair falling over her
shoulders. A worried expression adorned her face, and with valid
reason.</P><P>They had found out they were hiding in this town. It wouldn't be
long until they came and tried to take her away. She didn’t even
know why they were after her. She didn't even know who she was and
how she got there in the first place.</P><P>The girl wasn't alone in the room. A man with 
red, spiky hair was
standing not too far away, but it was impossible for him to see
outside as he stood in the shadows, untouched by the sunlight.</P><P>“We can't use the paths 
of darkness to another world. They all
have been blocked. They know for certain where we are and where we
want to go, Naminè.”</P><P>She nodded and closed her eyes. A lot had happened in the last 
few
days.</P>
<p align='center'><I>You and I?</I></P><P>Two entities in black robes were standing 
in
a hall that was lined with lots of pillars and had not a single light
in it. This was the private room of 'the Superior'. One of the robed
figures seemed to stare into air while the other had his hood already
removed and calmly reported in.</P><P>“Superior, Axel found on his patrol a weird girl 
walking around
near facility number sixteen. He detained her and tried to question
her, but apparently she doesn't know anything—not
even who she is or where she came from,” reported a man with an eye
patch.</P><P>He hated this. The Superior wasn't one to
like interferences, no matter how minor they were. On top of that,
all signs pointed in the direction that she was indeed a Nobody. But
one that young? And no memories at all? That was hardly possible. Not
even one of the people in the Organization knew anything about their
previous life. How could such a Nobody even exist?</P><P>The Superior looked at his 
subordinate and
removed the hood of the robe. Dirty
grey hair and a face sinister enough to make a child cry were his
looks. When he opened his mouth to answer the man with the eye
patch, it 1seemed
as if each and every one of his words were like poison for the other
man.</P><P>“Keep her restrained and bring her to Castle Oblivion. We do not
know if she has any value to us. I don't have the time to deal with
this right now, nor do I wish to deal with it in the near future.
Axel will be in charge of guarding her, to prevent her from trying
anything funny until I tell him otherwise,” ordered the man. He
turned around and, walking further into the dark hall, vanished from
the eyesight of the other robe-wearing man. Silence fell upon the
hall.</P><P>“As you wish,” approved the remaining man.</P><P>What benefit could they 
possibly gain from the girl? From the
looks of it, she had no special powers like all the others, nor did
she seem to be affiliated with any group that opposed the
Organization.</P><P>Xigbar vanished on the spot into nothingness.</P><P>“What? Why am I 
going to play nanny for the girl? Let Larxene do
it! She is a woman anyway,” complained a man with red hair to
Xigbar upon receiving his new orders.</P><P>He really wasn't pleased 2at
having to stay put just to play guard for a girl who didn't
even know where she came from. All he had gotten out of her was a
name—Naminè. He wasn't
even sure that it was her real name.</P><P>“Don't blame me, Axel. It's not
like I think it makes any sense to imprison her. She doesn't
know a thing. We don't even know who she originally was. I never saw
such a worthless Nobody. Anyway, bring her to Castle Oblivion. You
are there to guard her until you get other orders.”</P><P>Axel kicked after a stone and gave 
an
annoyed “pfft.” He should
have just ignored that girl and let her be. Now he had to play nanny
for her. How much worse could this day get?</P><P>While Axel was busy being annoyed, Demyx 
appeared and whispered
something to Xigbar, just to disappear shortly after.</P><P>“I'm done here. I have work to 
take care of. You go, and don't
make decisions on your own. The Superior will most likely take your
head if you get yourself into some dilemma again.” The eye patch-
wearing man waved to the redhead and vanished.</P><P>Axel was looking in the direction of 
where he had left Naminè.
Why did she need a guard anyway? A locked door would probably have
sufficed to keep her in a room for all eternity.</P><P>With a scowling expression, the man 
walked over to the temporary
prison and opened the door. It wasn't even locked. She could have
just run away, but Naminè was quietly sitting on a chair and staring
into thin air.</P><P>“Get up. You're coming with me,” Axel ordered the blond 
girl.</P><P>Naminè looked at him for a short period of time, then smiled and
stood up, ready to follow him. She didn't know where she was, who
Axel was, or even who she was. 3The
only memory she had was that of an indefinable voice calling
her Naminè. She just took that for her name, no matter if it really
was her name or not.</P><P>She tagged along without questioning his intentions. From how he
had treated her previously, he didn't have any ill motive. Most
likely he would only bring her to a different place where she would
be kept.</P><P>Well, she didn't have anywhere to go at all, so it wasn't too bad
that way.</P><P>“Say, what is your name? And where are we going?” asked the
blonde.</P><P>“Axel. Just call me Axel. I'm going to have to look after you to
prevent you from escaping. Don't think you would escape anyway. So
it's more of a stay put and nothing
bad'll happen to you,” replied the man without looking back.</P><P>This would take forever. 
How long was the Superior going to hold
her captive? And how long did he have to play guard? Why did the
Superior decide to keep her anyway? All right, Naminè appeared to be
a Nobody, but whose? And why did she have no memory at all?</P><P>With those unanswered 
questions, a boring daily life began. Axel
had to guard her, and instead of just standing in front of the door,
he sat most of the time on a chair in the room.</P><P>It was a plain white room. Marluxia 
had given them this one
because it was in a separate tower and he didn't have any use for it.
Only a bed, a couple of chairs,
a big table and a window featured the room, all plain white.</P><P>The days went by without 
anything 4exceptional
happening, and Axel grew slowly but gradually bored of this
job. How much longer would he have to continue this? Naminè was a
quiet girl. Didn't talk much, probably because she didn't knew what
to talk about. Most of the time she just sat on her bed, staring into
thin air, lost in her thoughts.</P><P>The blonde was not as bored as it seemed. For her, who 
had no
memory of anything at all, the
time passed as a prisoner didn’t bother her that much. It
gave Naminè time to think over what she saw in her dreams.</P><P>They didn't seem like they
were memories she regained slowly, nor were they visions, as far as
she was concerned. Where did she come from? Naminè was sure
she didn't belong here, and, for some reason, when she was thinking
about “home”, a view of a rough town and a gorgeous castle came
to view. It was the one from the dreams she had now and then.</P><P>However, Naminè had a 
bit
of pity on her guard, Axel, who seemed to be incredibly bored.
But what should she talk about
with him? He didn't seem like the kind of guy who would be
interested in dreams. And so, they just continued to remain silent.</P><P>Another few days 
had passed by, and Marluxia came by twice,
telling Axel that the Superior would examine the girl soon. It was
then that Naminè came to Axel, sat down right beside him, and
started to talk.</P><P>“Sometimes, I have weird dreams. I walk around in a foreign town
with lots of people looking at me. They all seem to know me and I
seem to know them. I wave at them, greet them with an unknown voice.
But, when I look into a mirror, I'm not myself. It's a girl with
reddish hair. Maybe it would be nice if I could do that too one day.
Since you're always there, it’s not so bad, but from time to time,
I wouldn't mind seeing other people,” the blond girl told her
guard.</P><P>Naminè decided to leave some information out. Such
as, the girl she was when she walked around in that foreign town 5was
named Kairi, and
she even knew the names of other people there. Also, Kairi seemed to
be what those people called the “Chosen One of the Keyblade”.
Naminè felt that it was the right thing to tell Axel about that. Not
sure why, but nevertheless, she told him.</P><P>Axel was quite puzzled. Why the heck did 
this girl have such
dreams? Sure, this wasn't the best place to be, however, such
detailed dreams were no ordinary thing. There was something really
fishy about this. On top of that, why did she suddenly tell him all
this?</P><P>“Sounds like another world to me,” said Axel, more or less
unheeding. He didn't have any special interest in the dreams of
someone else.</P><P>“You think I can go there?” asked Naminè with a curious
expression.</P><P>“Maybe. Maybe not. Depends on what the Superior 6is
planning for you,” said Axel, and waved around. Hopefully
this little play would end soon and they could just set the girl
free.</P><P>Naminè didn't ask any further questions.
That man, the Superior, didn't sound like someone she wanted to meet.</P><P>Just as Axel had 
said, two days later,
Marluxia came, took the blonde away, and brought her to the Superior
as he was ordered. He had his own plans. Using the girl would be
easy. All he had to do was make her interesting for Xemnas and focus
his attention on the worthless girl. It was the perfect time to set
his evil plan in motion.</P><P>Marluxia had reported false information to Xemnas. He told 
him
that the girl had a link to the Chosen One of the Keyblade they were
searching for. The stupid plan of the Superior was doomed to fail,
and once he had taken over, things would go another way.</P><P>“Go in there,” said the man 
with the dirty pink hair, and he
couldn't suppress a disgusting smirk. “Good luck.”</P><P>Naminè entered the room, and it was 
so dark in there that she
couldn't see anything at first. Slowly, her eyes adjusted to the
light, and there was a man waiting in the middle of the room.</P><P>“Come here at once,” 
ordered the man with a voice that gave
the blonde chills.</P><P>Naminè followed the order, standing in front of the man who was
almost twice as tall as she. He looked down on her with a weird
sparkle in his eyes, then suddenly slapped her hard enough to send
her flying to the ground. The pain was unbearable. Naminè held her
cheek in agony when she looked up, seeing the man standing above her.</P><P>He grabbed 
Naminè brutally
by her hair and pulled her up. That man did not know any mercy.</P><P>“Tell me what you 
know. Where is the Keyblader? Which world? I
want a name, and you're not getting out of here unless I get what I
want, girl.”</P><P>This was no ordinary human, and he had certainly ill intentions.
And what was worse, Naminè felt that it would be anything
but good to tell him about Kairi. Also, she really didn't know the
name of that world. And she had never told anyone about this.</P><P>Naminè just kept quiet, 
bearing with the pain. Clutching her eyes
shut to avoid looking in the eyes of the gruesome man, she was hoping
that he would believe her.</P><P>However, after another order to tell him,
she still kept quiet and therefore was sent flying again. Charging a
dark ball of energy in his hand, Xemnas asked her again—this
time not as calmly. When Naminè still kept quiet, he sent the ball
flying at her, making her squeak from pain.</P><P>Almost an hour and many cruel acts later, 
Naminè had lost
consciousness and Axel was called to take her back.</P><P>He had known that the Superior was 
a powerful man that didn't
accept any opposition, but this was just over the top. Naminè had
injuries all over the place and looked quite rough. That
sort of thing was definitely not necessary.</P><P>Axel took her back to the room, and she 
didn't even move for a few
hours. He was worried. Maybe he really 7shouldn't
have brought her to the Organization. Unlike Larxene, she was
just a girl without power, and if this continued, the Superior might
even kill her.</P><P>Naminè had endured it until the end. It made her strangely
satisfied. It was like she had protected Kairi, the girl she didn't
know from her dreams. But Naminè didn't know if she could endure
this a second time. The pain was just too much to bear.</P><P>Axel didn't want to turn 
against the Organization, but on this
point, it was more or less his fault that the 8girl
had to take this sort of treatment.
Feeling a little bit guilty inside, he tried to think of a way to get
her out of this misery.</P><P>His chance should come soon.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant 
Hearts---</P><P>Two more times had Naminè to go through hell under Xemnas’
questioning. She was at her limit. She couldn't stand another
questioning. Naminè tried to sleep, but wasn't able to. Her whole
body was hurting from the last time Xemnas had interrogated her. And
for the first time in her life, Naminè felt the emotion hate.</P><P>About a week later, 
Naminè seemed to be okay, although she was
even quieter than before. It was then that Axel decided this couldn't
continue. Orders from the Superior or not, he couldn't watch this
anymore. If she really knew something, she would have spilled it by
now.</P><P>He had gotten information that they had found the Chosen One of
the Keyblade, so Naminè was no use to the Superior anymore. 9It
was only a matter of time until he decided to kill her.
10He
wouldn't accept any witnesses.</P><P>Marluxia entered the room, looked over to the girl who 
had
undergone quite a lot of
torture, and with a disgusting smile, he told Axel of this new
orders.</P><P>“The Chosen One of the Keyblade will come to this place soon. We
are to stay guard in this place and then ambush them. We are to kill
everyone but the Keyblader. I doubt she will find this place, but
just in case, kill Miss Little Dreamy over there before they meet,”
spouted Marluxia. If there was one person that was even more abnormal
than the Superior, it had to be Marluxia.</P><P>Axel was about to rush at Marluxia and take 
his head. There was a
limit to everything, even cruelty. He would not follow that order, no
matter if it meant turning against the Organization.</P><P>However, he couldn't tell 
Marluxia that. He gave Marluxia a short
nod and a freezing glare.</P><P>The man just laughed and vanished. Poor Axel. If he followed 
this
order, Xemnas would kill him for disobeying his orders. If he did not
follow this order, he would probably be killed by that group from
Hollow Bastion. Xemnas had ordered him to bring the girl to another
place to avoid being seen by the Keyblader. Axel, one way or another,
was about to fall into Marluxia's trap.</P><P>It was this night, this dream, that Naminè 
found herself as Kairi
again, and it was the first time that both of them were sleeping.</P><P>When Naminè looked 
around, she was still in her room, but Axel
had vanished. Instead, Kairi was standing there, apparently unable to
see her. There was just one thought in her mind. Naminè took the
hand of the redhead and looked into her eyes.</P><P>“Help me, please!” That was her most 
sincere wish.</P><P>Whatever it was, whatever just happened, Naminè was thrown out of
the world of thoughts, back in the room, where she awoke, quietly
gasping for air.</P><P>What in the world had just happened? Did
Kairi hear her? Was that all just a dream? Only her imagination?</P><P>But what if Kairi 
really was real and she
had been just linked to her thoughts all the time? From what Naminè
knew, she was a nice girl who wouldn't hesitate to help someone in
need.</P><P>Would…Kairi come for her? Save her?</P><P>Tormented by sudden hope and doubt, 
Naminè had a difficult time
sleeping.</P><P>Axel had his plan. He would hand over Naminè to the group from
Hollow Bastion and ask them to beat him up a bit. It was a perfect
plan! At least, for his standards.</P><P>And the day came. News traveled fast, and Axel knew 
immediately
that they were there. Initially, he had planned to lure one of them
to Castle Oblivion and hand Naminè over. But
things tend to go other ways than people intend.</P><P>Naminè was standing on the top floor 
of the castle, looking
outside the window. She could feel that Kairi was there and that she
was on her way to this room. She really had heard her. She really had
come for her!</P><P>The blonde felt a single tear escaping her eyes. It wasn't a
dream. It wasn't a dream!</P><P>Simply overwhelmed with relief, Naminè was hoping that she 
now
could escape from this terror. Escape from Xemnas and his brutal
questioning.</P><P>Naminè's guard was waiting outside the room to explain to Kairi
what he had in mind. However, the second earthquake forced him to go
inside. Just when he thought the girl would withdraw from this
crumbling castle, he saw her for a brief moment on the window, which,
immediately after that, crumbled and fell down, along with a big part
of the remaining wall.</P><P>“Axel! Help her! She is going to be crushed on the ground!
Please!” yelled Naminè.</P><P>This whole place was going to hell. Axel had no choice but to 
jump
after her to prevent the girl from hitting the ground and dying
instantaneously after that.</P><P>The man jumped from parts of the wall with an immense 
speed
towards the ground, catching Kairi about midways. He managed somehow
to get back to the top floor before the girl opened her eyes.</P><P>Naminè was watching the 
girl she had seen every so often in her
dreams. But this was real. She stepped aside when Kairi got up and
started wandering around.</P><P>When Kairi reached the window and asked the obvious, Naminè
smiled and answered. “A friend did.”</P><P>The Keyblader looked around, apparently not 
putting up a show. She
really couldn't see Naminè.</P><P>Kairi wondered if this was a dream. She said it out aloud, 
and
Naminè just answered her truthfully.</P><P>“It’s very real. You almost died. You would have 
died if I had
not asked my friend to save you,” said the blonde, and she had to
smile. It was weird to talk with someone right in front of your eyes
who couldn't see you. Also, describing Axel as her friend was
probably not the wisest of all things, but it was too complicated to
explain everything to her now.</P><P>Apparently, it was exactly that that made the girl 
really
agitated. Kairi had started to wander around the room. She passed
Naminè twice and almost ran into the place where Axel was standing.</P><P>The next question 
was who she was. Who Naminè was, who her friend
was, where they were.</P><P>Naminè couldn't hold it in anymore and started to giggle. It was
kind of funny to have Kairi so close to her and yet she couldn't see
her.</P><P>“Who I am, I don't know. But you can call me Naminè. And I
saved you because I felt that it was the right thing to do. My
friend's name I can't give you, I'm sorry. But…I'm right here…”
said the blonde, and stood directly in front of the redhead.</P><P>Kairi seemed to feel that 
she was there, although she couldn't
see, and reached out with a hand. Initially, she would have grabbed
air, but Naminè walked a bit to the right, and the other girl
reached her cheek.</P><P>It was a very warm feeling, something she would have been longing
for if she had known it would feel like this. Eager to know, she also
reached out, laying one hand on the cheek of the girl. It felt even
better this way, and 11for
the first time in a long time, Naminè smiled with true
happiness.</P><P>She was about to say something, to ask her a thousand questions,
but an earthquake shook the place again. Naminè was startled, first
trying to cling onto Kairi, who jumped away. Axel reacted within a
second, taking her hand and pulling her along in the darkness.</P><P>Kairi seemed to be 
okay. Naminè could feel it.</P><P>The Keyblader looked around, then asking,
“Naminè…are you all right?”</P><P>As much as the blonde wished to have stayed longer with 
her, there
was no time. Castle Oblivion was about to be shattered to pieces, and
there had to be a reason for the earthquakes.</P><P>“I will bring you to another world. From 
there, we can plan how
to get to her,” said Axel.</P><P>This wasn't the time for a big good bye scene. He had to 
hurry
before the others caught him.</P><P>Naminè was thinking of Kairi and focused on the feeling 
she had
experienced for the first time. She just wanted to let Kairi know
that she was okay and would see her again.</P><P>The blonde looked at her guard, asking the 
impossible.</P><P>“Axel, please save her. Just bring her
down; she will be able to escape on her own.”</P><P>They were already in one of the 
corridors the Organization had
used in the past to travel between worlds when her guard vanished to
follow her plea without a word.</P><P>Naminè tried to tell Kairi that Axel would take her 
down, but
lost the other girl’s thoughts halfway.</P><P>Axel found the other redhead lying on the 
ground. Apparently, she
had gotten hit by a rock on the head and had lost consciousness.
There was no helping it. He carried her away, and not long after, he
encountered two women looking for someone. Axel just handed her over
and vanished into the dark.</P><P>Naminè was left alone in the darkness and was thinking. It 
had
been a unique sensation she had felt. There was something about Kairi
that gave her a special feeling. However, for now, they had to part
ways. At least Axel had promised to bring her to the world Kairi was
lived in.</P><P>When she was thinking of her, something glittered in the darkness.
Right below her—it
must have been clinging to her dress—lay
a keyring pendant. She immediately recognized what it was. Picking it
up, holding it between her hands, she thought of Kairi. Did she give
it to her 12intentionally?
Or had she lost it? While she thought of the girl, a mental image
emerged.</P><P>Right behind her was some kind of portal, while Kairi apparently
looked in the completely opposite direction. When the redhead made
the attempt to run in exact towards that way, she warned Kairi in her
mind.</P><P>“Don't go there. I'm safe. Hurry through the portal!”</P><P>It worked, but right 
after the Keyblader jumped through the
portal, she couldn't see anything. It was all blank. Back in her own
mind, she continued to examine the pendant.</P><P>While Naminè was examining the keyring 
pendant, Axel came back,
and it didn't take many words to explain that they had to get out of
there.</P><P>“The next world is an artificial town. 13If
we get lucky, Xemnas will just think we're dead and as flat as a
flounder,” said Axel, taking Naminè's hand and dragging her along
into the darkness.</P><P>It didn’t take them long to reach the other world. It was a
quite lively but peaceful town, bathed in warm sunlight. No one
seemed to notice the two walking through the streets.</P><P>“Over there is a mansion. We can 
hide there. I've been here
before, and I know that mansion is abandoned now. It's a safe place,”
explained Axel, and started walking in direction of the mansion.</P><P>Naminè stayed behind 
for a moment, thinking it over. A lot had
happened today. Not only had she met Kairi, but she also had
experienced happiness for the first time. After a short look over her
shoulder, she followed Axel.</P><P>The front gate was blocked by a huge lock on it, and even 
Axel
didn't want to forcefully destroy the door. It would certainly
attract the attention of the townspeople here. They had to avoid
standing out for now. Xemnas had certainly marked him as a traitor
and ordered the others to search for him.</P><P>“Stay here. I'm going to look for another 
way in. Don't do
anything rash,” were Axel's last words before he vanished into the
darkness. He couldn't get in through the paths of darkness either.
There was a weird barrier around the whole mansion.</P><P>Naminè was lost in thought. Was 
Kairi okay? Did they all make it
back to their own world? Which world was that anyway? She had to ask
Axel later. Naminè absolutely wanted to go there, wanted to meet
Kairi again. There was so much she wanted to ask her. So much she
wanted to tell her. It was as if she was her lost twin she hadn't
seen in years. Naminè couldn't put into words how she felt about
Kairi, but it was definitely a warm and welcome feeling.</P><P>Closing her eyes and 
recalling the moment they both had touched
each other’s cheeks and smiling, the pendant in her hands started
to take another shape. Quite surprised, Naminè opened her eyes and
witnessed how the pendant took the shape of a sword. It was gray
all over, and kind of looked like a clock had been the model
for it. A massive ring was around the handle, and there were three
spikes on the blade's upper end and two on the lower end. This was
one of the weapons Kairi had carried around—but
why?</P><P>The Keyblade was light and well-formed, but Naminè had never held
a weapon before. She tried to swing it around and promptly landed on
her bottom. It wasn't as easy as it looked when Kairi did it.</P><P>Once, in her dreams, 
Naminè had observed how Kairi
opened a lock with the Keyblade. There had to be a way to use
this thing. But how did she get it in the first place? Was it because
she cared for Kairi and it was originally hers? Or did it react to
just about anyone?</P><P>Hoping that it would work the same way as with Kairi, Naminè
stood up and directed the Keyblade directly on the lock and waited.
That was how the redhead had done it. But it refused to work for her.
Well, there hadn't been much of a chance that it would work the exact
same way it did for Kairi.</P><P>Still trying to figure out how it worked, the blonde walked 
closer
to the lock and examined it. It seemed normal. Although the one Kairi
had opened wasn't as big as this one, it should work. At least, in
theory.</P><P>Naminè tried to put the blade itself in the lock’s keyhole, but
that didn't do anything either. A little disappointed, she walked a
few feet back and tried to think of a different approach.</P><P>There wasn't much of a lead 
for how to use Keyblades to open locks
of any kind. It seemed absurd, but in her current position, it was
worth a try.</P><P>“Keyblade, open the lock!” Naminè
commanded the blade, and directed it at the object.</P><P>“Unlock the lock, Monochrome, 
please,” was her next try.</P><P>“Would you please open the lock, Monochrome?” followed 
that,
and, since really nothing happened, the blonde took a deep breath.</P><P>There was only one 
thing left.</P><P>Naminè tightened her grip, and started to run at the gate,
swinging the Keyblade with all her power and hitting the lock.</P><P>The backlash made her 
trip, and she fell
again to her bottom. That was <I>definitely</I>

the wrong method.</P><P>The blonde stood up, looked around to see if anyone was watching,
and closed her eyes. Her thoughts were a mess, confused by what all
had happened that day, and how she had felt when she finally met the
girl she had been dreaming about.</P><P>Naminè had wanted to tell her, to show her 
gratitude. She hoped
deep down in her heart that Kairi wouldn't forget her, no matter how
long it would take to meet her again.</P><P>Her thoughts became clearer when she focused 
more and more on the
redhead. She knew so much—the
names of her friends, where she lived, and how she was searching for
her childhood friends…and
yet, the other way around, Kairi knew nothing about her.</P><P>Naminè was a bit sad that 
they had had to part so soon after they
meet, but was sure that this wasn't the end. From here, the blonde
wasn't able to get ahold of Kairi's thoughts. It must have been
because of the special circumstances in Castle Oblivion that she
could have seen through her eyes.</P><P>When she opened her eyes, her thoughts were clear 
once again. She
focused her will on the Keyblade, and held a clear picture of Kairi
in her mind when she directed the Keyblade at the lock. For a moment,
nothing happened, and in her mind, Naminè asked the Keyblade to help
her.</P><P>A slight ray of light emerged from the peak of the Keyblade,
flowing into the hindrance that blocked their way in the mansion and
unlocked it. When the huge metal lock fell to the ground, Naminè
started and took a step back. It really had worked.</P><P>It was then that Axel came back 
and saw the girl standing in front
of the now-opened gate, holding the weapon that was similar to what
the Keyblade girl had been using.</P><P>“How did you get that?” asked the man, and scratched 
his head.</P><P>“Kairi must have lost it. I found in on the path we were using
after you left,” said the girl, smiling.</P><P>It was a precious keepsake from Kairi, and no 
matter what, she
would not give it away to anyone.</P><P>The rest of the day was spent in peace. The
Organization wouldn't be able to catch up that fast, and so Axel was
quite at ease, mostly sitting around and thinking about what to do
now. He didn't have much success with that and fell asleep all the
time, much to Naminè’s annoyance.</P><P>There wasn't much to do, so Naminè wandered
around and looked at the mansion. It was very old and run down, but
it was much better than Castle Oblivion. She was free to look at
whatever she found. In one of the rooms on the first floor, she even
found a block of white paper and a few various colored pens. The
Keyblade had returned to the shape of a key ring pendant. She didn't
really know how to change the shape of it; it was more an intuitive
kind of thing.</P><P>Naminè was sitting in the living room on a small stool, watching
outside the window and drawing the scenery, when Axel came to her.</P><P>“Naminè, I don't 
know how long I'll be
able to protect you from the Organization. They most likely know I
made a run for it with you, and they won't tolerate that,” said the
man, scratching his forehead.</P><P>How the hell should he explain this? Or, even worse, 
what the hell
was he supposed to do if she just declined that idea? But he had to
try nevertheless.</P><P>“Naminè, I don't know how to say this,
but you've got to learn how to defend yourself. I don't know if
that's going to be an easy matter, but it's just irresponsible
otherwise,” said Axel and sighed.</P><P>Naminè was all but excited.
She finally made it away from Xemnas and Marluxia, and now she
had to learn to fight? She didn't like that thought and was about to
object when she remembered that she now had a Keyblade. Kairi would
certainly be happy to see she could use it at least a little.</P><P>“But I'm not really cut 
out to run around and swing a Keyblade,
Axel. I can't do that like Kairi,” said Naminè and looked at the
former guard.</P><P>“Well, it’s not like there is only the
direct confrontation of the enemy. Like, Larxene uses electric knives
and Demyx—ah, you don't
know those two…um…let's see…if you're weak in physical combat,
you've got to beat the enemy by superior tactics or intelligence. I'm
pretty sure you can do that,” explained Axel, and grinned.</P><P>Naminè wasn't really sure 
if that was such a good idea. She had
never, not once, really fought against anything. And now, out of the
blue, this? However, on one side, she somewhat wanted to show Kairi
she wouldn't be a hindrance. On the other side…it was not fair to
rely on others all the time.</P><P>She gave the redhead a short nod and focused
her mind again on her most precious moment with Kairi in Castle
Oblivion. It didn't take long, and the Keyblade she had found with
the name “Monochrome” engraved on the hilt had taken shape.
Naminè looked expectantly at Axel, who was still amazed that the
girl could use a Keyblade. As far as his knowledge was concerned, the
Keyblade refused to work for Nobodies.</P><P>“Well, for starters, try to make a horizontal 
and vertical swing
with it,” said the man, starting the combat lecture.</P><P>Naminè was right. She was 
definitely not cut out for close
combat. The first swing made her trip, and she almost crashed into an
old table. Axel had to facepalm and tried to think of something
different.</P><P>If the girl was indeed a Nobody, she must
have the ability to use magic. That was the one thing the stronger
Nobodies had in common. Although Larxene and Demyx were much, much
better than he was, he had to suffice. Magic was not something where
you had to have a strong body to use it efficiently. The mind was
much more important.</P><P>After the second try, the vertical swing, Naminè almost fell and
Axel called her off. There was no way this girl would ever learn to
fight properly with a weapon.</P><P>“We’ll try something different. Focus
your mind on the…Keyblade, and try to imagine a flame as hot and
wild as possible. The bigger the better,” explained the man, and
waited for Naminè to follow the instruction.</P><P>First, nothing happened. Absolutely 
nothing at all. While the
blonde tried with all her might to imagine a flame, her thoughts
drifted over to Kairi. Naminè immediately relaxed upon that, and
swiftly opened her eyes when Axel shouted something.</P><P>“Uh, who would expect her to get 
a grip of
it that fast? Gah, hot, hot, hot, shoot!” yelled the man and tried
to put out the fire on his robe. Apparently, Naminè had used a fire
spell intuitively and had set Axel on fire.</P><P>“Oh, I- I'm sorry, Axel,” giggled the 
girl. It was just too
funny watching how the man tried desperately to erase the fire from
his robe.</P><P>“All right, all right, it seems you got it. Now, I'm gonna go
and take cover while you try to do that again. This time, aim at that
almost ancient candle over there. That won't burn even if I were to
put an inferno on it,” said Axel, and took cover behind an
armchair.</P><P>The lecture continued for almost another thirty minutes before
Naminè finally had managed to hit the candle with a fireball. There
were several scorch marks on the wall, the ceiling, and another
armchair had lost its life upon her tries.</P><P>In the end, Naminè knew how to do it in 
theory. First you had to
focus on the magic self. Second was to focus on your target. Last was
to channel your mind force through the converter—in
this case, the Keyblade.</P><P>“That's way more than enough for today. But that's long not
enough to hold off someone from the Organization. But you've got
talent, for real. Now, please, put away the Keyblade, and don't try
to burn down the house, okay?” sighed Axel, and after looking
around, he left the room.</P><P>Naminè was proud. She had managed to use fire magic, and for
someone who had never even been interested in fighting, that was a
big deal.</P><P>Finally finished with the “lecture”, Naminè picked up the
block of paper and continued to draw the outside. The sun was already
deep on the horizon and bathed the room in a warm, reddish light.</P><P>“I wonder what Kairi 
14is
doing right now,” said the blonde to herself.</P><P>The day ended without any further 
events. While Axel slept in the
last unburned armchair, Naminè found herself a bed that was still in
pretty good shape on the first floor.</P><P>The night was, at least for the girl, a restless 
one. Her thoughts
about Kairi just wouldn’t vanish, and she still looked every now
and then at the key ring pendant that was
lying beside her on her pillow.</P><P>Two blue eyes were fixed on the ceiling,
unable to rest and let the girl sleep. When would she meet Kairi
again? Was she even okay? She had to explain a thousand things. And
even if Kairi only followed her call for help out of curiosity, she
still had come, regardless what her reason had been. She even climbed
that ridiculous Castle, and then, there was <I>that</I>

moment.</P><P>“I wonder if she's noticed that one of her pendants are missing.
I wonder if it wanted me to find it on purpose. Couldn't be, right?”
giggled the girl as she turned around. It was still there.</P><P>But what if Monochrome 
really had decided to stay with her? Had
such a key ring pendant really a mind of its own? And why would it
want to stay with her anyway? She wasn't a fighter, and even if she
had learned fire magic today, she was still far, far away from what
Kairi was being able to do.</P><P>“So, why?” pondered the girl, fixating her eyes on the
Monochrome pendant.</P><P>Maybe it was to bring her back to Kairi. Maybe there was really
something such as fate? She had no explanation for what happened, and
probably would never get one. But one thing was certain. She would
not let go of it. She would return it to Kairi, or maybe even keep
it.</P><P>Lost in thought, the girl fell asleep without noticing.</P><P>The next day was 
15full
of more lectures
about how to use fire magic, since that was all Axel could do. Sure
enough, the Organization already knew where they were hiding, and
soon would try to get him. But Naminè didn't know that. He wouldn't
spill the beans. Not until it was unavoidable.</P><P>Naminè was standing just a few feet 
away, looking outside the
window, Monochrome held in her hands. She refused to let go of it for
even the slightest moment. It was her precious keepsake from Kairi,
the girl that had come for her.</P><P>“Are you sure it's okay to keep this? I mean, after 
all, it
belongs to her,” said Axel. He was a bit worried about Naminè
being so fixated on this Keyblade.</P><P>Naminè stood there, smirking like a little kid, and 
waved
Monochrome around.</P><P>“Yeah. I don't think she really lost it. I think it wanted to
stay here, that it wanted me to find it,” replied the blonde.</P><P>She looked outside the 
window. The sun was high on the sky, and
shone into the room, bathing the room into warm light. The town was
still peaceful. There was no sign of the Organization.</P><P>“Say, Axel, do you think we are 
safe here?” Naminè asked the
former guard.</P><P>Axel stood up and walked slowly over to where Naminè was
standing. He was standing right beside her, looking at the same
peaceful town she saw, and gave her a nod. This had become his job.
It was also the right thing to do for him. He would bring her to
Hollow Bastion, no matter what.</P><P>“I think so. But it's only a matter of time before 
they find us
and we have to run again. And it won't be easy to hide from them. The
Organization has a lot of spies,” complained Axel, and sighed.</P><P>“I'm counting on you, 
Axel,” said Naminè, and smiled at him.</P><P>The rest of the day was, as far as it concerned 
those two, normal.
Naminè practiced the usage of fire magic and Axel tried to collect
information on the Organization movements.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant Hearts---</P><P>A 
room, covered in dust, fragments of
pillars, and still as dark as ever, was the former hall of empty
melodies. In the middle of all the chaos stood a man with dirty grey
hair, looking quite displeased. He wore the same black robe as the
other entity in the room, which stood right beside him. Wearing the
same black robe, he had his face covered by the hood of the robe.</P><P>“What is it, 
Xigbar?” asked the first man. The voice was
colder than ice.</P><P>“Superior, we found out where Axel is hiding. He took the girl
with him. He betrayed the Organization, just as Marluxia did.”</P><P>“Good. Kill him. Kill 
the girl also. We do not need her anymore.
We know now who the Chosen of the Keyblade is, and where she lives.
We will have her work for us. If inevitable, wipe out the whole
world. I will not accept failure this time. Take Demyx and Saix with
you. Use whatever means necessary,” the man ordered his
subordinate.</P><P>The first man vanished into the darkness, and the other stood up,
and revealed his face, looking even more displeased than the one that
had just vanished.</P><P>“That Axel. He should have known better than that,” were the
last words that echoed through the room before he left.</P><P>Not much later, and not so far 
away, in Saix’s personal chamber,
they were discussing how to kill Axel.</P><P>“Why do I always have to do those kinds of 
jobs?” complained a
blond man. He was holding a giant blue musical instrument that was
very similar to a guitar.</P><P>One of the other two had his hood still up, and the third 
was
Xigbar, who looked incredibly displeased.</P><P>“Quiet, Demyx. It's an order from the 
Superior, and I will not
bear with your complaining. Now, for the plan.”</P><P>The second man, the face hidden under 
his robes hood, started to
speak. It was a deep voice, one that even gave Xigbar chills
sometimes.</P><P>“We will block the paths of that world
with the summoner- and berserker-class Nobodies. There are only three
paths: one to this world which he can't use, one to Hollow Bastion,
and one to that stronghold of those weird creatures,” summarized
the man.</P><P>“And who is going to kill Axel and the girl? I don't want to do
it. That’s more like a job for Saix here. Or you do it, Xigbar.”
Demyx continued to complain</P><P>Xigbar gave him an icy glare and sighed.</P><P>“I will do 
it. You two are more of a backup anyway. If Axel
shows resistance, we're going to overrun the world. We will not leave
a single witness,” concluded Xigbar.</P><P>It was all but looking good for Naminè and 
Axel.</P>
