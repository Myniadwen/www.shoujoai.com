<a href="../kinghart/valiant2-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><p align='center'><I>Loneliness,
I and the Sunset</I></P><P>The
sun was almost setting when the three girls finished exploring the
deserted island. Nothing but small animals and a lot of wild fruit
were present. At least they wouldn't face hunger soon. But much more
important and grave was the fact that there was no Keyhole portal as
they had hoped. Kairi, Olette and Naminè were trapped on the island,
and there didn't seem to be any possibility of getting away other
than through a gateway.</P><P>“I
think we can at least say this: we're stuck and have no idea how to
get out of here.”</P><P>Kairi
stated the obvious, but it wasn't really helping. In such moments,
she had to keep a clear mind for the sake of the others. In such a
situation, she had to stay calm. Surprisingly, Naminè wasn't as
scared as Kairi had thought. And Olette, if she indeed was scared,
didn't show it openly.</P><P>For
now, they had neither a way to escape from this island nor from this
world. It was only logical to assume that the number of problems
wouldn't increase any further. First off was to secure water and
food, of which the latter was a easy matter, as the island was full
of fruit and palms. For water, beside the water of the vast ocean,
there wasn't any source of matter on the tiny island. Kairi had once
made the mistake of drinking salt water from the ocean. It was not
fit to be drunk. Maybe they could use some—</P><P>Kairi
was ripped out of her thoughts. Sparrow, the former captain of the
Black Pearl, had walked up to Olette and had just given her a nip of
the contents of a bottle he was holding. The brunette coughed
immediately and her face turned more red by the second.</P><P>“What
is in that bottle?” Kairi asked, demanding a answer.</P><P>Sparrow
stood up, leaving Olette, who was even more confused now, where she
was and walked over to where Kairi was standing.</P><P>“This,
girl, is some of the finest and best swill you'll ever find across
the seas. Each 'n every pirate would sell 'is own mother for a bottle
of this,” Sparrow mumbled.</P><P>The
pirate was drunk on the bright day. And whatever was in that dirty
bottle, it wasn't good for the girls to drink.</P><P>“Olette,
stop that. It tickles too much,” Naminè said, which got Kairi's
attention. The blond girl was being hugged by Olette, who was
nibbling on Naminè's ear.</P><P>“Don't
you dare give them any more alcohol. I'm not trusting you yet,”
Kairi said.</P><P>“That's
some mean thing to say. Didn' I save yer pretty friend? But 'tis the
fate of a good ol' honorary pirate. Always the ingrates I get, I tell
ye,” Sparrow responded, more or less, and walked over to the beach
to lay down and drown himself in more of the weird swill.</P><P>It
took Kairi a moment to separate Olette and Naminè. While one had
been constantly giggling, the other was slightly confused by the odd
behaviour. That's right, Naminè didn't know what alcohol was, nor
what it did to otherwise completely fine people. But Olette, having
had a normal life for about sixteen years, was bound to know. At
least, that was what Kairi had been thinking. But to give someone
injured alcohol wasn't the brightest of all ideas.</P><P>“Kairi,
don't be a prude. I was just teasing her a little bit,” Olette
said, in a voice that implied Sparrow wasn't the only person here who
was drunk.</P><P>They
had to get Olette back to her senses, and fast. Kairi didn't know
when the sun was going to set, nor how cold it got at night in this
world. Not to mention that sleeping out wasn't the brightest idea,
considering that the Organization was still after them.</P><P>Pulling
Olette along, Kairi got her close enough to the ocean to just
sprinkle some water on her face. It had little to no effect. Olette's
face had turned bright red from whatever Sparrow had given her.</P><P>“Okay,
I bet she is going to complain later, but we need Olette in a sober
state if we want avoid sleeping out under the sky today. And I really
want to avoid being found by those pirates, in case they come back.
Help me to get her into the water, Naminè.”</P><P>It
was a bad habit to be overly careful, but Kairi didn't know anything
about this world or about the pirates or the member of the
Organization. It felt like things couldn't get any worse.</P><P>“Kairi,
shouldn't we ask Sparrow for help? He looks like he knows this island
and we don't.”</P><P>That
much was obvious, but Kairi didn't want to rely on a drunken former
pirate ship captain. “We don't know anything about him. Sure, he
helped us to escape, but he really doesn't look like he is very
reliable.”</P><P>Kairi
wanted to get out of this misery on her own. “On her own” meant
not relying on others, proving that she wasn't just an accessory from
the Hollow Bastion gang. Naminè and Olette were new to this, but
they managed themselves better than Kairi had in her first missions.</P><P>Naminè
had noticed that Kairi was a bit more timid around Aerith and Tifa.
It wasn't so odd when she reminded herself that those two were like
parents to the redhead. But it did look like Kairi's mood always hit
rock bottom when the topic changed to missions in other worlds.</P><P>From
the argument they had at the evening of the night they left, Naminè
could only guess that Kairi wanted to show her parents that she was
able to do things on her own. Aside from the natural affection she
bore for Kairi, this was one of the things that attracted her. The
will to stand up for her own mind's decision, and the power to go
through with that very decision. There were other things too, but
Naminè couldn't really grasp what they were.</P><P>A
not-so-elegant and mighty splash later, Olette was dripping wet, but
at least she had come back to her senses.</P><P>“My
head is spinning,” Olette grumbled, and held the very same to make
it stop.</P><P>“Sparrow
gave you some of his whatever-it-was. I'm not sure if it was in good
intent, either,” Kairi replied, and walked over to help Olette up.</P><P>“My
whole throat is burning, my head is spinning, and I swear, if he ever
comes near me with a bottle, I'm going to hit him with the Hero's
Crest right on the head,” the more or less drunk girl mumbled.</P><P>It
took a while for Olette to be able to walk without stumbling every so
few steps. Kairi had checked the island. It was roughly a few hundred
feet long and about as wide, in the middle a collection of palms and
other things. There were plenty of wild fruit and coconuts. Water was
now a urgent matter, but even that was resolved rather easily. Naminè
had seen Sparrow vanishing between the palms, and just a bit later,
they had found a trap door in the ground that led to an underground
hideout.</P><P>For
whom, and by whom, that didn't matter at the moment. The ridiculous
amount of alcohol aside, there were other things they could drink,
although only very little of what they found had any labels. Most of
the bottles were identified by sniff and test, which inevitably led
to three slightly primed girls.</P><P>At
least they had found a resolution to the problems of water and a
place to sleep. It was very smelly down there, though, and it was
basically impossible to breathe for a short time period without
coughing, so they started moving most of the (for the three girls)
worthless alcohol out of the hideout. Sparrow didn't protest, as it
saved him from having to go down the stairs into the mouldy
underground to get another bottle.</P><P>In
the middle of all that chaos, Kairi had stopped working and looked at
the ground. This was definitely the worst mission and situation she
had ever been in.</P><P>“Missions
usually don't go this badly. I just wanted you two to know that I
will get you two home, no matter what happens to me. It's me who got
you into this mess, and--” Kairi was brutally cut off by Olette,
who took Kairi's hand. It was wrong to take all the blame for
herself.</P><P>“We
went along on our own decision. It's not your fault. And you don't
have to do this on your own. At least let me help you, Kairi. I'm
sure I won't be...”</P><P>Olette
knew this scenario. Someone didn't manage to go through with what
they had planned and was about to give up midway. That someone always
ended up relying on her, or wanting her to help. And Olette would
always give it, no matter how she felt about it. She feared no one
would respect her if she didn't. It had always been like that. Even
Hayner and Pence only acknowledged her after she showed to be a
natural in struggle. Now that same tired scenario would repeat here
with Kairi. It would be just the same. People only liked her because
she was good with many things. If she were just a normal girl, nobody
would care.</P><P>“I
know you want to help, but it already helps that you're here, that
I'm not alone. For now, that's more than enough for me.” And Kairi
freed her hand and continued to put away the bottles.</P><P>It
was a shock for Olette. No one had ever denied her help before. Or
even wanted to not rely on her, to do things on their own. Was it
because Kairi had gone through a lot of horrible things? Was she
scared to rely on others? Whatever it was, this feeling was pleasant
but strange. Olette felt that it was weird to look back at her, now
that she knew that Kairi didn't rely on her. Was she just stubborn?
Unable to accept there was someone that didn't want or need her help?
For now, all she could think of, was that this had left a nice
feeling inside her. Was Kairi special? Someone Olette could rely on?</P><P>Time
went by much faster than they thought it would. According to Sparrow,
they were in a southern sea, on which the nights are short and the
days hot and long. That meant most of the time they would immediately
know when a ship was coming.</P><P>The
girls moved a few old wooden boxes and cases into a corner of the
basement and used the cloths that protected the boxes inside from
dust to get by in the cold of the night. They helped, even though the
cloths were rather thin and dusty. To provide a bit more warmth, they
slept close to each other.</P><P>Kairi
had first been against that, simply because she already knew that
Naminè wasn't likely to just lie there. Olette was immediately
annoyed when Naminè came up with the idea and refused to say
anything. She was still in distress over that. Was she simply annoyed
by how natural Naminè acted about this or was there something else?</P><P>By
the time they finished the emergency cleaning of the basement, the
sun was setting. It was getting cooler by the moment, but it was
still warm enough to run around in much less than they usually wore.
Kairi left the basement to look for something to eat, and Olette went
with her, leaving Naminè at the entry of the hideout to watch for
Sparrow. Kairi didn't trust him.</P><P>Olette
wanted to say something about earlier. It was eating her up from the
inside, and her head was feeling funny. But the words didn't want to
flow. After a few fruits and coconuts, it was the redhead that
started talking.</P><P>“I'm
sorry about earlier. I...just want to do this on my own. I'm not a
little kid that can't do anything by herself. Nor are you, that's not
what I'm saying. But this is my fault, no matter how you arrange the
pieces. I'm...usually not this talkative. I don't know, it just feels
like I can talk to you about anything.”</P><P>Kairi
didn't stop walking and picked up another fruit. It was almost enough
for the three. Tomorrow, they would have to come up with a plan how
to escape from the island.</P><P>“I
don't think it's your fault alone. You're not responsible for
everything and anything alone, Kairi. Deep down, you're just another
girl, like I am. The Keyblade has
chosen you, but that doesn't change the fact that you have weaknesses
and emotions like everyone else. No Keyblade will change that,”
Olette responded.</P><P>She
stopped walking and looked to the sky. She was right. Kairi was just
another girl. Even though she traveled through worlds and had to
fight those things. It didn't change the fact that she had feelings,
dreams and fears too. It was only now that Olette fully comprehended
what Kairi had gone through. All this Keyblade business must have
kept her from all those things.</P><P>For
Kairi, that was one weird thing to hear. 'Just another girl'. It was
like someone was directly looking inside her, past the Keyblader,
past all the responsibility, past the mission. Kairi was often
thinking how her life would have been like if the Heartless had never
come. If she hadn't been the chosen of the Keyblade. The thought of a
normal life wasn't so bad. But that would also mean she never would
have met Aerith, Tifa, Leon and all the others.</P><P>Olette
didn't seem to just look at her like everyone else (Naminè aside)
did. For them, for everyone back in Hollow Bastion, she was first the
Chosen and then a girl. For her, for Olette, it seemingly didn't
matter that she was a Keyblader. For Olette, she was just a ordinary
girl. Up until now, Kairi didn't really look that closely at Olette.
Naminè was the one who really captured her attention with her
behaviour and mysterious relation. Olette had none of that. She was
the most normal Keyblader out of the three. But somehow, it was good
that way. It felt like she could let loose a bit with her around.</P><P>“--
back?”</P><P>Kairi
was ripped from her world of thoughts. Olette must have been talking
for a while, since the brunette was looking rather curiously at her.</P><P>“Did
you say something?”</P><P>Kairi
had to admit, she wasn't there with full concentration. Not only was
this mission one of the worst ever, but she had problems of her own
to attend to. Naminè was one. But at least Kairi knew she could talk
to Olette. A strange comparison, but for Kairi, Olette was like a
secret diary in that one could write anything, that one could share
its dreams with. Olette had a life that Kairi envied her. A ordinary
one, up to when the Keyblade destroyed her peaceful life too.</P><P>“I
said, should we go back? The sun is setting and we should have enough
for today and tomorrow morning.”</P><P>Kairi
walked next to her, every so often looking out of the corner of her
eye at the so normal and yet not normal girl. It was a bit weird how
she could find someone who was the closest to a normal person she had
ever known that interesting. Olette didn't seem to notice, but she
smiled all the way back for some unknown reason.</P><P>They
got back at dusk and Naminè was waiting for their arrival. The load
of fruits was put into a previously emptied basket. Due to the lack
of dining utensils, they had to resort to more or less funny methods.</P><P>Olette
cut the fruits. With her Circle of Life Keyblade. It was quite a
disaster of fruit juice and leftovers on the ground until she got
used to only cutting and not using her full strength. Tifa's training
seemed to have had quite an effect. Naminè was to cook them and
freeze the leftovers. Fire and Ice magic were easy to use, and Kairi
could have done it too, but Naminè had better control of the spells
due to her ability to use recitations. Some fruits, however, ended up
as charcoal and some just died upon the flash freeze. Kairi had to
make the best out of what was left over after the disastrous cutting
exercise and the burning or freezing.</P><P>“It
tastes...interesting,” Olette said, and her facial expression said
more than thousand words.</P><P>“It
smells funny,” Naminè said, poking the fruits with a little stick
that served as fork.</P><P>“I
wonder if I would choose this over Tifa's curry,” Kairi said, and
with a unpleasant expression, she ate whatever it was they had cooked
up. There was a severe lack of words to describe things like that.
And it was good that way.</P><P>“We'll
keep watch in groups of two. Olette went with me and collected fruit,
so she can take the first sleep from us. Where is that Sparrow fellow
anyway? If he comes near this hideout, don't let him in,” Kairi
instructed, and left immediately later.</P><P>Olette
held Naminè, who was about to just run after Kairi like a loyal dog,
back for a moment.</P><P>“You
didn't forget what you promised, yes?” Olette didn't know why she
reminded Naminè of that in this moment. Was she feeling a bit
jealous about being left in the basement? Or was she just being mean
to the girl in white?</P><P>Naminè
just smiled. After Olette let her go, she quickly left the hideout
and went after Kairi, who was standing just a few meters away.</P><P>“In
six hours, you can go to sleep and Olette will switch positions with
you. You and Olette can take the last part together. That way
everyone gets enough sleep for the moment,” Kairi said when Naminè
had caught up.</P><P>“Okay.
But what is keeping watch? What do we do?” Naminè asked the
question Kairi was waiting for.</P><P>“We
look after the hideout and make sure that no one enters and that no
Heartless come onto the island. We have to keep our eyes open for the
Organization member too. I'm sure he'll come back once he finishes
his business with the pirates.”</P><P>That
was enough of a explanation for Naminè. In short, she had to stay
awake and look after the island. In the meantime, she got to spend
time with Kairi, just the two of them. It wouldn't hurt if she clung
to her just a bit. Maybe it would help the redhead to relax a little.</P><P>For
the first couple of minutes, Kairi was busy with looking around,
making sure that she hadn't overlooked anything. In a situation like
this, it was important to keep a keen watch.</P><P>She
startled and immediately summoned Oathkeeper when Naminè laid a hand
on hers. Kairi was clearly on a end with her nerves. Taking all the
blame for this whole thing was definitely something that surpassed
her limits.</P><P>“I'm
sorry. I'm just a bit nervous. We don't know when the enemy will lead
his next attack, and --” Kairi sighed.</P><P>Explaining
all that to Naminè seemed a little bit pointless. It was not that
she didn't understand. But the fact that Naminè could stay that calm
made Kairi feel a bit stupid. And maybe she was right. Was Kairi
taking all this too seriously? The Organization had not shown any
interest in them after they had become stranded on the island.</P><P>“The
sun here looks almost like the dusk sky over Hollow Bastion,”
Naminè said, and walked in direction of the beach.</P><P>When
Kairi glanced over at the sun, her eyes immediately became glued to
the view. Naminè, walking towards the ocean, the sun shining against
her, and the warm wind blowing created a really special atmosphere.</P><P>It
was weird. Kairi had never really cared for these aspects of life. Or
rather, she couldn't, up until now. The view was amazing, and before
she knew it, Kairi had joined Naminè in her walk to the beach.</P><P>They
walked next to each other, each once in a while glancing over at the
other, feeling the wind in their hair, the warm sun of the dusk on
their skin, and the presence of a familiar person by their side.</P><P>It
had been a long time since Kairi just enjoyed walking on white sand
simply because she wanted to and not in order to fight, not to comply
with all the expectations people had of her. The last time she had
done this had been on the Destiny Islands.</P><P>Naminè
stopped walking and knelt down, running sand through her hands.
Everything was new to her, as she didn't know anything but what she
had learned from her dreams. But the feeling of this, the feeling of
being here with her, was something she could never have learned from
just illusions and dreams.</P><P>“Say,
Kairi...how long do people keep being friends? You won't disappear,
right? This isn't just another dream, and when I wake up, I will be
back in that white castle, and --”</P><P>Before
Naminè could finish, Kairi knelt next to her and took her hand.
Naminè didn't look sad. It was more like she had her own worries.
Kairi never had thought about that, simply because Naminè didn't
seem to be the type to worry overly much.</P><P>“I
won't just disappear. And you won't either. This is real. You can
feel my hand, can't you? That is proof this isn't just a dream,”
Kairi said.</P><P>With
a smile on her lips, Naminè got closer and finally leaned against
the redhead. She didn't let go of Kairi's hand, the proof that this
was not a dream. It was stupid, but she couldn't help but think that
once she let go, it would become a dream again. Even though she was
basically untouched by the problems of normal people, she had grave
ones of her own.</P><P>Kairi
didn't mind. Not in the slightest. It could have been the atmosphere
or her overworked mind, but she freed her hand and embraced Naminè.
She sat behind her, able to smell her hair, her scent, able to
closely feel her skin. It was completely different from the forced
relationship they had before.</P><P>“You're
warm. Much warmer than before,” Naminè said, leaning further back.</P><P>“You
think so? It might be the sun,” Kairi responded, still holding the
girl. She took another deep breath.</P><P>“Not
that. Your feelings are much warmer. You don't have to be cold,
Kairi.”</P><P>Naminè
freed herself from the embrace to turn around and take place on
Kairi's knees, looking directly in her face.</P><P>“I
don't know what you mean. I'm not --” Kairi knew. She knew what
Naminè meant and the lie she wanted to spout had been confirmed by
those eyes inside her. She just couldn't lie to her.</P><P>“I...will
try. I can't promise anything,” Kairi said, slightly sighing. She
had been avoiding all that she was experiencing right now. It would
be a hindrance on missions, and that was all she had cared about in
the past.</P><P>“That
is good enough.” Naminè gave her another smile and clung even
closer now, returning the embrace, dangerously close to Kairi's face.</P><P>It
was Kairi who started blushing upon her advance. Naminè did these
things as if they were the most normal acts in the world. Kairi
envied her.</P><P>“You're
awful close, Naminè...didn't we want...to stay just friends...?”
The words came slowly and with hesitation. A voice in her head, the
one of reason, was screaming for her to stop, but her body wouldn't
listen.</P><P>It
was a strange feeling. Really pleasant, but awfully wrong at the same
time. And yet Kairi didn't want to stop. This was a first for her,
and she didn't want to devote her life to the Keyblade mission for
all eternity. In her own eyes, Kairi was first a girl, a teenager,
and <I>then</I> the—no, <I>one</I> of the three Chosen of the
Keyblade.</P><P>“Don't
friends share their dreams with each other? Their feelings? Isn't
that what makes us truly friends?” Naminè could feel Kairi's
warmth, could feel her chest moving under her breath, going faster by
the second.</P><P>“That's
the line between lovers and friends...I think.” Kairi wasn't so
sure of that in the moment.</P><P>It
was hard for Kairi to keep a clear mind. The whole situation was
literally breathtaking. Her heartbeat was going faster than even in
the most difficult battle, and Kairi could not remember when she had
ever been so nervous.</P><P>“It's
like I'm looking into my own eyes.”</P><P>“Then
you're looking into beautiful eyes.” Naminè really was a natural
at smooth-talking.</P><P>Naminè
really knew when to say such things. Either it was just instinct or
being natural, Kairi couldn't stand it any longer. She looked at the
ground and her face turned a deep red in seconds.</P><P>“Your
face is all red.”</P><P>“That's
the sun.” Kairi could <I>feel</I> that she was blushing.</P><P>“My
face is not red.” Naminè had a little smirk on her face upon
saying this.</P><P>“But
it should be!”</P><P>Kairi
lift her head and looked directly into Naminè's eyes. She was so
close that a few strands of blond hair tickled Kairi's face. Her face
was not red. It was so unfair, and yet, Kairi couldn't blame her.</P><P>“You're
cheating.”</P><P>“How
so?” The blond girl giggled as Kairi turned her head away in
embarrassment.</P><P>“Because
you aren't...” Kairi was almost whispering to herself.</P><P>“I
can't hear you.”</P><P>Kairi
was still taken by her presence. She was like a completely different
being. No tactical planning, no calm and calculating mind, no fears
of other people. Naminè was like a key to her inner side, to a side
she had long sealed away in order to survive the harsh life of the
Keyblader. But maybe it was time to open that lock. Maybe a bit. A
little bit. Just to take a peek at what was beyond.</P><P>“Say...why
do you like me?”</P><P>Kairi
had wanted to ask that ever since Naminè had first shown her
affection to her. There was apparently no reason for it. If it was
only for showing up in that castle, it really didn't matter that it
was her. But if there was something else...</P><P>“At
first, I didn't know. Even now I don't even know why. But you're
strong. I know I can depend on you. I trust you. And you protect me,
don't you? I think...I like that part about you. The strong-willed
Kairi, the Kairi that can protect me. But I like the other side of
you too.”</P><P>Kairi
never knew that Naminè could be so profound. She had anticipated a
simple answer. Not knowing what to think about this, Kairi took it as
compliment. If there was one thing real, then it was Naminè's
affection for her.</P><P>“The
sun is about to vanish. You won't vanish, right, Kairi?” Naminè
leaned her forehead against Kairi's and waited for her to respond.</P><P>“No.
I won't.”</P><P>The
response was different to anything Kairi had anticipated. Naminè
pulled herself closer in an instant and after seconds or hours, Kairi
couldn't tell, she felt the blonde's soft lips on her own.</P><P>The
kiss was amateurish, as they were inexperienced, but in this moment,
both of them felt like they were in heaven.</P><P>Naminè
was being demure and waited for Kairi to return the kiss. It only
took her a instant to do so.</P><P>This
was different. Not only did Kairi grasp a much better feeling of it,
but there was something else inside her that started to move. It was
like a wave, something that wanted to burst out. A immense feeling,
but Kairi didn't care. All that important was right in front of her.</P><P>Kairi
could feel a urge to go further, to make one more step. It was
completely overwhelming and everything seemed just to be right now.
Burying her hands in the flaxen hair, Kairi deepened the kiss and
could feel Naminè responding to it as she laid her arms around her.</P><P>Just
when Kairi wanted to continue all that was she was doing, a most
awful feeling walled up. Nothing like guilt or blame—it was more
like a hunch of something terrible.</P><P>Scared
like a mouse, Kairi jumped back. Naminè fell over in the sand as
Kairi tried to get back to her senses. The last seconds had been more
than just strange, but the kiss wasn't the problem.</P><P>Kairi
had seen pictures of Naminè's mind. Inside the white castle. Being
tortured. A red-haired man. Kairi was so agitated that it was several
seconds before she noticed Naminè was still lying on the ground.</P><p 
align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Where
is she? This island. Those people. She has seen them before. But
there are neither names nor faces for those people. Shortly after,
darkness walls over the sky. The island is being devoured by
darkness, by the creatures called Heartless.</P><P>The
images fade away, showing a town with a ever-dark sky. A feeling of
duty, one of a immeasurable size. The urge to escape, to run away,
fear. Whose feelings are those?</P><P>The
images fade again, drifting in darkness. Soon, a town in the desert,
the feeling of guilt. Soon it changes to a different place. A vast
ocean, a ship, disappointment and despair. Yet again, only seconds
pass until the image fades. There is nothing but darkness. No
emotion. No hope. The empty darkness is icy and empty. A light tries
to reach the path that is there, in the absolute darkness, but fails.
Again, the urge to run away. The scattered belief in oneself.</P><P>Time
goes by and slowly, the darkness lifts, just to show what fears are
made of. The death of a star, the end of yet another world. A dark
night sky, star-studded. One star falls, the next follows. The images
rotate. They show the ground, blood and tears. They let one feel the
bitter truth of failure, and then the night sky again, empty as the
shadows.</P><P>Only
to fade once more, the images change again. Nightmare, the ultimate
test for courage. The feeling of mistrust, of jealousy and of hate. A
world that is not one. A ruin of that what was once a kingdom. The
door to the heart of darkness. Infinite cold beyond. No way back. The
fear for one's life. And yet, a shimmer of light, of bliss and ease
after the darkness is past.</P><P>Lastly,
a shivered image of a white door, immense and powerful, and two
people. The same people that were on the island, in the first image.
A arm is stretched out, the light of a Keyblade roars through the
air, tears fall and hope is crushed yet again. Falling on knees,
screaming out to the vanishing door, screaming out how unjust fate
is.</P><P>The
last image fades and nothing but darkness is left.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“...up!”</P><P>Someone
was calling. The last thing she could remember was darkness.</P><P>“Naminè,
wake up!”</P><P>Kairi
was calling. Did she fall asleep? Was all that a dream?</P><P>She
opened her eyes to see Kairi right above her, Naminè's head laid on
her lap. Kairi wasn't making any effort to hide the fact that she was
worried sick.</P><P>“You
were passed out for almost half a hour. I was about to carry you to
the hideout and ask Olette for help. What happened? Right...before
you passed out, I...I think I saw some images of your past.”</P><P>That
was not as shocking as what Naminè had experienced. A flood of
images and memories had gone through her, something much bigger than
all of her own memories together. It had been frightening. Naminè
didn't move; she tried to catch her breath. It felt like the whole
island was ice cold, cold as the darkness that had been the last
image.</P><P>“I
saw your past too.”</P><P>Those
words hit Kairi like lightning. Her past was full of horrible things.
Most horrible things. She didn't want anyone to know what happened
back there. Nobody should know. Kairi wanted those memories sealed
away.</P><P>“It
is time for Olette to switch with you. You should get some sleep.”</P><P>Kairi
was back to the cold tactician. She helped Naminè up and turned
away, only showing her back in the darkness. The sun had completely
vanished.</P><P>“I'd
like to forget tonight. I think that is the best.”</P><P>That
wasn't a plea. It felt like a command. A cold command, one that a
officer gives a foot soldier. Kairi was, deep down, infinitely scared
of the thought that Naminè had seen her past. The present was bad as
it was, with the Organization now posing a new threat. But someone
who could stir up her past was definitely not good.</P><P>“Kairi,
I think—” Naminè wasn't able to finish her sentence.</P><P>“I'm
going to patrol the beach. Wake up Olette.”</P><P>And
Kairi vanished in the shadows of the night.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Olette
was worried. She had never seen Naminè like that. It was as if Kairi
had vanished or something.</P><P>She
had only slept a few hours. Her whole body was aching, her head still
slightly spinning from that day. Maybe fresh air would do her good.
But first, she had to find out what happened to Naminè.</P><P>“I'm
just tired.”</P><P>Naminè
didn't want to talk about it. True, Kairi had wanted to kiss her, she
even went along with it, but what happened after that was definitely
not her fault. It was wrong to blame her, and it was wrong for Kairi
to act like that. It wouldn't help to tell Olette.</P><P>Naminè
went to sleep, but it was not peaceful. It was the first time ever
that Olette saw Naminè so miserable.</P><P>It
was too early to blame Kairi, but it couldn't be a coincidence that
Naminè was like that after being alone with the redhead.</P><P>It
was pitch black out and it took Olette a few minutes to find Kairi,
who was sitting on the beach, glazing on the dark horizon.</P><P>“You
look tired.”</P><P>Kairi
startled and immediately went up, rubbing her eyes and trying to keep
a poker face. It failed so miserably that Olette was a bit scared
that the usually that strong-willed Kairi was like that. Just what
had happened when those two were alone?</P><P>“I-I...oh,
never mind.” Kairi didn't know how to act. Maybe she should just
tell Olette, or keep it a secret, but at this rate, she would break
out in tears any moment and there was little choice but to tell her
anyway.</P><P>“Calm
down, Kairi.” Olette took her hand but Kairi immediately pulled
hers back.</P><P>Olette
tried it once again, trying to help her, and again Kairi tried to
break free. This time she failed. The brunette was a lot stronger
than she was, even more so in her current state.</P><P>When
Kairi had no choice but to admit defeat, she began to calm down a
bit. It was a surprise, but Kairi leaned against Olette, hoping for
comfort.</P><P>It
had been ages since something happened that agitated her that much.
She just didn't know how to deal with this alone.</P><P>For
Olette, this was not what she had hoped for. She had only wanted to
talk with her, not comfort her on this level. But before she knew it,
Olette had laid both her arms around Kairi and, standing like that,
pulled her closer.</P><P>At
some point, denying the obvious was just being ignorant or a dreamer.
Olette had to admit that it felt good, holding Kairi like that. It
was a little sad that Olette had to admit this to herself while Kairi
was in such a bad state.</P><P>“Will
you tell me what happened with Naminè?” Olette never knew she
could ask like that. Soothing and nice. Not forceful, but not
allowing a 'no'. It was even more surprising that Kairi nodded and
came even closer.</P><P>Olette
could feel her breath on her skin. She got immediately goosebumps and
her heart was racing. To what extent did she like Kairi? Was is just
the urge to comfort her because Kairi wanted her to, or did Olette
herself want this as well? She didn't know.</P><P>“We...
kissed.”</P><P>Olette
could have guessed about as much, but to hear it firsthand wasn't as
pleasant as she had imagined. It was hard not to push her away, but
Olette kept holding her. It was a mix of feelings.</P><P>'Why
Naminè and why now?' It was the first thing Olette was thinking.
Didn't Kairi want to keep her at an arm's length for the time being?
Olette even gave her advice on the matter. And most important, what
should she do now?</P><P>“So?
I guess she forced that on you, right?”</P><P>That
was the logical guess for Olette, and in the moment, it felt
ridiculously good to blame Naminè for the state Kairi was in. Was
that jealousy? Envy?</P><P>“It's
complicated...”</P><P>Olette
had different ideas as to what Kairi meant and none of them were
especially pleasant now that she knew for sure that she had a
interest on Kairi, or girls in general. Which of them, Olette
couldn't tell yet.</P><P>“I'm
listening.”</P><P>Kairi
took a deep breath and stepped away from Olette. She turned around
and got back to her position, sitting in the sand, as she had been
when Olette arrived. Of course the other girl wouldn't just stand by
when Kairi was about to possibly break out in tears again. Seconds
later, Olette sat right next to the redhead, but not looking on her
face.</P><P>“I
can't really explain it, but while we kissed, <I>it</I> happened.”</P><P>Olette
didn't understand. What was <I>it</I>? This was just another
unpleasant thing to hear. Naminè was a friend, but if Olette found
out that Naminè had forced something on Kairi, then...</P><P>“It
was like...we saw each other's pasts. There wasn't much in Naminè's,
and I was just seconds later back to my senses...but Naminè was out
for almost half a hour. I don't know how much she saw, but my past is
definitely nothing I want anyone to see.”</P><P>Olette
didn't understand. It was weird that someone as strong-minded as
Kairi was so overly sensitive about some mistakes in the past. Also,
it didn't look like that was the whole reason. From the little time
Olette knew Kairi, she could tell that the redhead was tending to
keep a lot of things to herself.</P><P>“I
guess that's not all. I bet you're hiding something.”</P><P>It
wasn't all, and it really was bugging Kairi, but to tell Olette
wasn't really pleasant.</P><P>“No,
really, that's all.”</P><P>“Am
I that untrustworthy?” Olette knew that something was bugging
Kairi. She was also curious what had happened aside from the kiss. It
was bugging her, too.</P><P>Even
though nothing much had changed, Kairi felt that there was little
choice but to believe in Olette. During the time Naminè had passed
out, Kairi had thought a bit about several things.</P><P>“Am
I weird?” Kairi couldn't look at Olette. Instead, she looked at the
ground.</P><P>That
came, for Olette, out of nowhere. What did she mean? Of course it was
weird to travel through worlds and have a Keyblade, but that wasn't
what she was talking about.</P><P>“I
mean...yeah, I did give in to the kiss. It...wasn't bad. I...think I
liked it. That's weird, isn't it?” Kairi really seemed worried
about this.</P><P>That
was the talk of someone who would find oneself guilty anyway,
regardless what was being said. One of Olette's friends was like
that.</P><P>“I
don't know...sure, liking another girl isn't really the most normal
thing on earth, but...look, you live with Aerith and Tifa and—”
Olette couldn't finish her line, Kairi butted in.</P><P>“Tifa
and Aerith are different. This isn't anything like with those two.”</P><P>Olette
was a bit annoyed that Kairi just cut her off like that, but that was
to be expected from someone who was a emotional wreck.</P><P>“I
never thought about liking a girl before...”</P><P>“I
don't think there is anything wrong with liking a girl, Kairi.”</P><P>Olette
could feel that this conversation was slowly but steadily slipping
out of her control.</P><P>“I
just gave in to her. Just like that. I didn't really think twice
about it. And I thought I really had willpower...”</P><P>“I
don't know. Are you sure Naminè didn't force it on you? I
mean...maybe you only think you gave in, when she really—”</P><P>Kairi
stopped Olette midway. It hadn't been like that.</P><P>“No,
really. If I had resisted, she would have stopped. I think.”</P><P>“So...maybe
there was something else? I heard from Tifa that you aren't really
hanging out with people your age. I guess your body finally demanded
some comfort. If it is only that, you can come to me. I won't force
anything on you, just because you're vulnerable.”</P><P>Maybe
it was the truth, maybe not. Neither Kairi nor Olette knew for sure.</P><P>“Thanks.
I...will come back for that offer.”</P><P>Olette
was sure that there was still something bothering Kairi. It took
Olette only a short moment to notice what she had forgotten.</P><P>“How
are you going to handle Naminè now?”</P><P>Kairi
knew what Olette meant but decided to play dumb. In all honesty, it
really was a bit annoying when one was able to see through someone
else like Olette did right now with her.</P><P>“What
do you mean?”</P><P>“She
broke her promise, so what are you going to do?”</P><P>Kairi
had already handled that. For now. It had been a unpleasant decision,
but it was necessary. They could think about what to do after this
mission.</P><P>“I
told her the kiss never happened. I...don't want to lose another
friend. I'd rather forget all about it and continue like before, even
if it would be a bit awkward...”</P><P>Olette
at first didn't know what Kairi meant with 'another', but she then
remembered that Kairi really was on a quest to look for her childhood
friends.</P><P>“I
don't like thinking about all this. I just...don't know what I should
think anymore!”</P><P>Kairi
looked to the right side, and from the noises she was making, Olette
guessed that she was about to cry again. But she wouldn't put salt on
her wounds.</P><P>To
prevent any further crying from Kairi, Olette laid a arm over Kairi's
shoulder and pulled her closer to herself. It always was soothing to
be held.</P><P>“Olette,
don't...it's nothing, and...” Kairi tried and failed.</P><P>“It's
not nothing. I don't know your past, and I'm not interested. It's not
anything we can change anyway. And remember that you're a girl, just
like me, and after that, we're Keyblader. There's nothing wrong with
making mistakes and sometimes showing a weak side.”</P><P>It
was as if Olette could read her mind and said exactly what Kairi
wanted to hear. But for the moment, that was a good thing.</P><P>Kairi
leaned on Olette a little more, resting her head on the girl's
shoulders as she slowly began to calm down down. It was like this
afternoon—unlike everyone else, Olette saw the girl in her. In a
sense, it really was something special. Around Olette, she could let
loose, could forget about the important mission that carried on for
years already.</P><P>She
moved even closer, still leaning on Olette. She was now really close
to her. Kairi could feel Olette's breath on her neck, could feel her
chest going up and down. For Kairi, it was a chance to be her other
self, the ordinary girl who liked to fool around with her friends.</P><P>“You
think you could pet my head?”</P><P>Olette
almost laughed, but she managed to suppress it and instead just
smiled. At least Kairi seemed to be opening up a bit. Her own
feelings for Kairi were in complete chaos, but for the time being,
this was more than enough.</P><P>“You're
a dog or something?” Olette sneered, and blew a bit warm breath in
her neck.</P><P>Kairi
immediately got goosebumps, but didn't move. It wasn't that bad.
After all, she knew that Olette didn't have any intentions like
Naminè had. It was just fooling around a bit.</P><P>“Tease.
Bad tease,” Kairi complained and played a sulking face, even though
Olette couldn't see it.</P><P>It
was more of a sister relationship, or one of best friends.</P><P>Instead
of doing it again, just to tease her further, Olette really started
petting her head. It was a nice feeling to have Kairi's hair running
through her fingers, and when Kairi leaned further back, so that
Olette could almost look down in her face, she felt her heart going
faster by the second.</P><P>“Say
Olette...when I'm like this...can I come to you and you'll pet my
head?”</P><P>Kairi
said it with a smirk, even showing Olette her tongue and then
giggling.</P><P>Olette
slowly felt a heat. They were in the south sea, but this heat was
uncommon. Where did it come from?</P><P>“If
you pay me, that is,” Olette responded.</P><P>She
could have immediately hit her own head. 'If you pay me'—what kind
of ridiculous response was that? Why did she ever so often stumble
over her own words when talking to Kairi?</P><P>“Okay,
I'll pay you. But I decide on the payment.”</P><P>That
really was a unexpected response. It seemed that Olette was not the
only one who was a bit clumsy with words when it came to such
situations. Or Kairi had something evil in mind.</P><P>“You're
plotting something, aren't you?” Olette teased the first Keyblader
further.</P><P>“Yes.
Something really evil.” Kairi smirked again and poked Olette's
sides. The other girl returned that action in an instant.</P><P>After
continuing that game for a few minutes, both of them were gasping for
air. The poking had gone a bit overboard and they had both started
laughing. Olette was laying on her back in the white sand of the
beach, which was more a light grey in the darkness. Kairi was right
next to her, also laying on her back.</P><P>“I
never knew you could have fun like this, Kairi.”</P><P>“It's
thanks to you. I would never be able to do this with Naminè or even
Yuffie.”</P><P>Olette
was happy that both their faces were bright red. She could tell that
she would've been blushing if not for her already reddened face.</P><P>It
took them a few minutes, and out of lack for breath, they didn't
speak a word. It was, for Olette and Kairi likewise, fascinating how
they could be like that. Not so long ago, Kairi had been crying and
Olette was deeply annoyed by the fact Naminè had kissed her.</P><P>“We
should look around the island,” Kairi said, but it was not her
usual cold attitude.</P><P>Olette
was happy to tag along. In the darkness of the jungle, Kairi would be
unable to see that her face was still red. Guessing was one thing,
and all the time she had been in Hollow Bastion and near Kairi, the
question plagued her. Did she like girls, and if so, did she like
Kairi? At least the first question could be answered with yes at this
point. Maybe it was because of the situation that she was looking at
Kairi like that.</P><P>After
a few minutes of silent walking, Kairi stopped, half-hidden in the
shadows of the night, half-visible from the light of the moon.</P><P>“You
are okay, aren't you?”</P><P>Olette
had no idea what Kairi meant. They hadn't done anything dangerous in
the last few minutes, and why was her voice wavering?</P><P>“I
think so. We didn't really do anything dangerous. I'm feeling good, a
little headache and lack of sleep—”</P><P>The
next action made what Kairi meant very clear. She had, the previous
one and the argument on the night of their departure aside, never
seen Kairi have a outburst of emotion. Kairi turned around,
apparently angry over something, and smashed her hand on a palm.</P><P>“You
almost died on that cursed ship! How can you say we didn't do
anything dangerous?! God, I was so worried...”</P><P>Olette
didn't really know what to say now. She was good at comforting people
with their problems, but this time, she herself was the problem.
Sure, it wasn't her fault. There was little she could've done to
prevent what happened. And now that she was thinking about it, right
after she woke up, she saw Kairi's face. And, yeah that was it, Kairi
had apparently cried back there.</P><P>“You
cried, thinking I was gone, didn't you?”</P><P>Bullseye.
Kairi said nothing but turned around and hid her face in the
darkness.</P><P>Most
people would now have said something to comfort the other, something
to make clear it wasn't their fault when they apparently were giving
themselves all the blame. Not so Olette.</P><P>Kairi
was embraced and could then feel how Olette was whispering in her
ear.</P><P>“I'm
fine though. I get by that completely inhuman training with Tifa. If
a bit of darkness and stuff is all that is necessary to make you
worry, I'm going to have to comfort you every night. How should I
keep up with that?”</P><P>Olette
could feel heat rising inside her. Standing like this, even though
she was just comforting Kairi, gave her more than just a pleasant
feeling. It was much more. For a split second, she had wanted to draw
Kairi closer to herself, tighten the embrace and do...some things.
Olette really was happy that Kairi cared about her. Nobody else did.
Not like this. But how long would she be able to stay like this? Her
heart was going faster by the second. Kairi would notice.</P><P>Kairi
was feeling a bit better. When Olette was joking about it like that,
she didn't feel so bad anymore. Maybe she really had a bad habit of
forcing the blame on herself.</P><P>“Thanks.”</P><P>“Oh,
uh, no problem. I guess. Just...” Olette didn't know what to say.
Her mind was all fuzzy.</P><P>“Shall
we...continue our rounds? You'll need to let me go first for that...”</P><P>Olette
was a bit startled. Sure, she had only meant it to comfort Kairi, but
now that she was about to let her go, it occurred to her that this
was more of comforting herself.</P><P>There
was a certain thought in Olette's head, and it had become more clear
by the moment. If she really saw Kairi just as friend, why was her
heart beating like that?</P><P>Before
Kairi could say anything further, Olette let her go and took a few
steps backwards. She felt a bit dizzy.</P><P>After
some time, as they had no clocks to check the time and they both
weren't able to measure the time on the hands of the moon, Kairi and
Olette returned to the hideout. It was Kairi's turn to sleep.</P><P>When
Kairi was about to go down the stairs, Olette wanted to make sure
everything was okay.</P><P>“You
sure you told me everything that bothers you? About you and
Naminè...kissing?”</P><P>It
wasn't the most pleasant topic for Olette. She had to admit it now,
she liked Kairi more than she had guessed. Olette wasn't sure if she
had a crush on Kairi or not, but still, talking with her about her
and another girl kissing wasn't pleasant.</P><P>“Yeah...I...look,
I want to forget that it happened. I want to stay friends with her.
At least for now. I'm not so sure what I should think anymore.”</P><P>Kairi
was confused. Sure, she had wanted to be just friends with Naminè.
She even got Naminè to promise that she wouldn't cling to Kairi like
before. And now? She had given in to that kiss so easily, even liked
it. What did she really want? Was all what she was thinking just made
up? Was she afraid of confronting her emotions?</P><P>“I
think you should, at least until we're out of here, act like nothing
happened. After that we'll have enough time to think about it. But if
you can't take it anymore, you can just come to me and talk to me.”</P><P>Olette
could have run into a palm tree. Just what was she saying? Leaving
the issue like this? That wouldn't help Kairi at all. If anything, it
only made it worse. And there was this stinging feeling in her chest
whenever the issue came up. Why did she say something like that? Was
that...being jealous?</P><P>Olette's
still having advice for her put Kairi at ease. It was good to see
that she wouldn't leave her side. On her way downstairs, however,
Kairi remembered something important.</P><P>“I
forgot. Your payment.”</P><P>Before
Olette could clear up the joke, Kairi had already done it. One step
forward, both hands on her shoulders, and a kiss on the cheek.</P><P>It
came as such a surprise that Olette stood there with open mouth.
There was no ill intent from Kairi—she had done it to get Olette
back for before.</P><P>“See
you in a few hours.”</P><P>Kairi
was about to step down the ladder to the basement again when Olette
held her back for a second.</P><P>“You'll
be okay with Naminè?”</P><P>Kairi
just nodded and vanished.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“Are
you mad?”</P><P>Olette
and Naminè had walked almost three times around the whole island.
Olette's feet were aching all over, but standing still meant talking
with Naminè, and Olette wasn't sure she would be able to be friendly
to her. Kairi had calmed down and even when Olette checked on her,
after she had talked to Naminè, everything seemed to be fine.</P><P>“I'm
not. What should I be mad about, anyway?”</P><P>Olette
knew very well about what. In fact, she would've been mad if not for
Kairi and the happy time she had with her after the disaster with
Naminè.</P><P>“I
broke my promise. Kairi said it was a slip-up, but you're still mad.”</P><P>Naminè
could instinctive feel when someone was mad or not. But in this case,
it was kind of obvious that Olette was annoyed and mad.</P><P>“I'm
not mad!” Olette practically yelled at the girl in white, who was
frightened by that action and took a step back. “Okay, I am, but
what did you expect? You broke your promise, kissed Kairi, saw her
past although no one can blame you for that. But I can blame you for
kissing her. I doubt Kairi humped you and started it.”</P><P>That
much was true, but Olette was keeping quiet about what happened
between Kairi and herself. Naminè didn't need to know that, at least
not now. It would only lead to annoying questions.</P><P>“I
don't know. I don't want you to be mad. I was scared too when I
saw... felt those things. It wasn't something I wanted to see. I
didn't do that on purpose.”</P><P>Now
Naminè was fighting back. It was not right for Olette to put all the
blame on her. Sure, she did something wrong with kissing Kairi, but
when Kairi had already forgiven her, it was stupid for Olette to
carry it any further.</P><P>“You
did kiss her on purpose!”</P><P>“She
isn't that upset about it anymore. It's more that—”</P><P>“But
she should be! You broke your promise, forced a kiss on her, and who
knows how far things would have gone if that weird memories thing
hadn't happened!”</P><P>“Why
are you angry about me kissing her and not because she got upset?”</P><P>Olette
could feel that this wasn't going to end well. Naminè saw right
through her.</P><P>“Because...'cause...who
said I'm angry about you kissing her?!”</P><P>“So
you <I>are</I> mad about that.”</P><P>“That's
none of your business!”</P><P>Naminè
was now a bit mad herself. Olette was acting childish.</P><P>“I
don't want to argue with you, Olette. I know it's my fault for
kissing her, but you're really acting odd.”</P><P>She
knew it. Olette knew she was acting odd. But it wasn't so easy to
just swallow what she had seen and heard and still be friends with
Naminè.</P><P>“I
don't want to argue with you either, not really. But...I don't know,
maybe I'm just tired and overacting.”</P><P>Naminè
made a effort to get along with her. It would be really stupid to
stay stubborn and continue like that. Maybe she should talk openly
with her. After all, Naminè wasn't out to displace Olette or
anything.</P><P>Olette
decided to cool down a bit and went to the close beach, throwing some
of the icy water in her face. She needed to clear her head; her mind
was filled with nonsense. Why was she acting like this? Kairi wasn't
her girlfriend or anything even remotely close to that.</P><P>“I'm...um...sorry.
I didn't want to act like a moron, but the more I was thinking about
it, the more I got heated up. I didn't even hear your version of the
story.”</P><P>“That's
okay. Aerith told me that even the best friends argue and act like
idiots from time to time.”</P><P>“You
didn't have to call me an idiot, Naminè...”</P><P>Olette
took a deep breath and sat down in the sand. The night was a bit
chilly compared to the hot day that had welcomed them. Maybe it was
time to face reality and think about what to do.</P><P>“What
did it feel like?”</P><P>Now
that she was at least halfway over the matter and had cooled down a
bit, curiosity got the better of her.</P><P>“What
do you mean?”</P><P>Naminè
was unsure what Olette meant. The kiss, the memories, the—</P><P>“The
kiss. What else would I ask about?”</P><P>The
slightest thing was enough to get her back in a annoyed state. Her
mood was very delicate right now. On one hand, Olette really was
jealous. On the other hand, she was even more curious.</P><P>“It
felt...good. I can't really explain it, but her lips really are soft,
and she was so shy when we kissed. Completely unlike the Kairi we
know. It was like a fire was building up inside my chest. And I could
feel that Kairi liked it too.”</P><P>Naminè
drew several lines in the sand while telling the other girl and
didn't dare to look up, secretly blushing like a ripe tomato. Now
that she was talking about it like that, it seemed much bigger of a
deal than it had been.</P><P>“I
wish I could have switched with you.”</P><P>“Did
you say something?” Naminè had overheard whatever Olette had said.</P><P>“No.
Nothing. Brr, it's really gotten cold.” Olette tried to escape, now
that she had said <I>that</I>.</P><P>“Are
you sure you said nothing? I'm pretty sure I heard you mumbling
something.”</P><P>“Maybe
you got a little too excited from telling me about kissing her, huh?”
Now Olette was teasing her, poking her a little.</P><P>She
had said that out loud, by mistake. The urge to imagine how it would
be to kiss Kairi was simply overwhelming.</P><P>“Look,
the sun.”</P><P>Naminè
pointed on the horizon. It really was time for her to get up. The
first night was over.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“That
was...the most interesting breakfast I've ever had.”</P><P>Kairi
looked down at the leftovers. Some sort of fruit, by now
unidentifiable, was lying there, having survived Olette's preparation
process and Naminè's more or less successful cooking attempt. It was
amazing in itself that anything was able to get past that. It was a
good thing the Heartless weren't that persistent.</P><P>“Not
much we can do on this forsaken island,” Olette complained as she
threw every leftover in a bush.</P><P>The
three girls were sitting on a big stone that served as table and
chairs at once. The early morning hours had brought a terrible rain,
and now the whole island was soaking wet. The sun had just come out,
and the only halfway dry place was this rock. To eat in the basement
was impossible. Due to the rain, almost every single insect one could
think of was hiding down there. Not even a horse would get Naminè or
Kairi down there. Olette had offered to dispose of them, but Kairi
got away with saying the air down there was as thick as a wooden
plate anyway.</P><P>“We
shouldn't waste time. We need to get away. Now that I think about it,
did either of you see Sparrow?” Kairi asked, less out of curiosity
than because she thought Sparrow could know a way out of this misery.</P><P>Both
girls shook their head. That was weird. This island wasn't that big,
and even when the rain had been pouring down, there had been no trace
of Sparrow.</P><P>“He
isn't our main problem. I don't think this guy from the Organization
will leave us alone. Sooner or later, and I think it's going to be
first one, he will come back. We escaped to a isolated island, but he
could have easily followed us. That also could mean he must have some
sort of plan.”</P><P>Kairi
was almost like someone with a split personality. While both of the
girls had gotten to know a completely different site of her, they
were always surprised how easily Kairi could adjust back to her
tactician personality.</P><P>“We
don't have the time to wait for a ship to come by, nor do we have the
tools to build a float ourselves. I have an idea how we could get
away, but it's going to be really dangerous. We don't have much of a
choice, though. The only other option would be to stay here and play
sitting duck.”</P><P>Kairi
wasn't thrilled by that idea. It was basically even stupid and
childish, but there really was little other choice. It was good that
Kairi knew a bit about the nature of Keyhole Portals.</P><P>“We
will freeze our way to where the ship was and use the remains of the
portal there. A gateway leaves a certain signature, and like almost
everything, a Keyblade can open that signature. I alone wouldn't be
able to make it big enough for a person to pass, though, but with the
three of us, we should be able to—”</P><P>Olette
stood there with open mouth. This was a tad too ridiculous to come
from Kairi. Had the fruits been poisonous? Had Kairi gone mad? Was
she hallucinating? Naminè didn't seem to understand what Kairi was
saying, as she didn't have that 'Are you insane?' look on her face at
all.</P><P>“Do
you even remember where the ship was?!” Olette turned around,
randomly pointing in directions.</P><P>“That's
easy to find out. A Keyblade remembers the last portal it opened,”
Kairi said and summoned Oathkeeper, pointing it straight at the sky.</P><P>A
second later, a thin light ray emitted from the blade roared a few
hundred feet through the air and vanished in mid-air above the ocean
to their right.</P><P>“Naminè,
it's your job to freeze the water. I'm barely able to do so, since I
lack the ability to use recitations, but you should be able to do it.
Olette and I will take care of any Heartless that try to attack you
from the water.”</P><P>That
was a huge duty for the blond girl. It was quite far, and freezing
even a small part of the ocean should be ridiculously hard. They had
to walk on it, so it had to be pretty massive too.</P><P>“I'll
try my best.” She didn't want to stay on the island forever either.</P><P>It
was a bit weird to look at Kairi like that, after what happened the
night before. Sure, she shouldn't have kissed her, but seeing Kairi
completely ignoring her hurt. Maybe it was for the better this way,
but somehow, Naminè would've preferred it even if Kairi would have
acted a bit awkward around her. Like this, it was as if the previous
night never happened.</P><P>Naminè
decided to talk to Kairi after they left the island. It shouldn't
remain between them like this, and Naminè was eager to clear the
air. After all, she wanted to be with Kairi.</P><P>“We're
in the south sea, so we'll have to wait until it's dark. Otherwise,
we'll be too much under time pressure. Having the sun melt the ice
won't help,” Kairi instructed further.</P><P>Olette
sort of looked up at her. She had thought about this in this short
time, and considering what had happened that night...</P><P>“We'll
rest to gather our strength until it gets dark. Especially you,
Naminè. I don't fear the Heartless in the ocean as much as us
running out of energy halfway. If we do, we'll have to swim. And with
the countless Heartless in the water waiting for us, that's not a
good decision. But I know you can do it. I trust you. And you too,
Olette. If not for you, I don't know who else I would trust to watch
my back.”</P><P>For
the brunette, was that a huge compliment. Kairi trusted her to such a
extent already. Even though Kairi usually didn't rely on her, it was
obvious that it would be stupid not to. Olette was a good fighter.
And even though she was completely unable to use magic, Kairi had a
high regard for her.</P><P>Naminè
knew that this was her first chance to prove she wasn't just tagging
along and needing continuous protection. Her great latent magic
potential would finally be put to use. And on the vast ocean, she
could completely let loose.</P><P>“We
will keep guard alone. It's bright and I don't think the Organization
would attack in the middle of the day. I'll do the first guard since
I slept the most. You two go to sleep. Olette, I'll wake you up in a
few hours. We need to be in top form for tonight.”</P><P>Both
of the girls agreed on that, even though Olette would have preferred
to keep watch with her.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“<I>Mistress
of Ice, Lady of the Cold, Shiva Irselia, lend me your power, grant me
your might and let all and anything that stands in our way freeze
until the end of all days.</I>”</P><P>It
was a extremely powerful recitation that Aerith had taught her to use
in case of a emergency. It was very draining, but the spell was on
par with the most powerful Blizzaga one could possibly imagine. Only
a summon would be more powerful.</P><P>At
least three hundred feet ahead of them, water was forming a bridge of
ice more than five feett wide. It took them over half a hour to walk
to the end of it. Magic ice was very smooth and they had to be
careful not to stumble.</P><P>“That
really was impressive, Naminè. I didn't know you could do this kind
of stuff.”</P><P>It
was like a sweet dessert for her to be praised by Kairi. Honestly,
the spell had completely misfired, as it was intended to be a attack
spell that had a range of over one thousand feett. But it was good
that she had managed to use it correctly at all.</P><P>“Now
the second wave. The direction is still good.”</P><P>As
if to prove her words, Kairi hold her Keyblade up and the light
passed over them in the same direction Naminè was facing.</P><P>“Aerith
said I can use that special recitation only once every twenty-four
hours. A second use could anger Shiva, and Aerith said that it would
be suicide to anger a spirit lord.”</P><P>Kairi
knew what Naminè meant. Aerith told her of several stories about
when she had used summons, and a few times she had even witnessed
their immensely destructive power. To go up against such a thing
truly was suicide.</P><P>Naminè
was kneeling on the ice, preparing the next spell, when the first
Heartless decided to attack. It wasn't much of a battle, as the
Heartless were at home in the ocean and basically helpless on the
bridge of ice.</P><P>“<I>Child
of that which is Eternal, Lord of Snow and Storm, Shiven Irselia,
loan your power to me, the one that calls upon the infinite kingdom
of white.</I>”</P><P>A
cone of cold emitted from Naminè, freezing another part of the
ocean. The bridge must be now almost scale five hundred feet, maybe a
bit less.</P><P>Kairi
was amazed that Naminè was capable of such spells already, but she
had to admit that it was probably one thing to just unleash a spell
on a static target and another thing to carefully measure the power
and hit a moving target, like a Organization member.</P><P>“We're
doing well. Are you okay, Naminè?”</P><P>Kairi
knelt next to her and patted her head. It really was astounding. The
otherwise fragile girl could let loose one powerful spell after
another.</P><P>“I'm
fine. I can continue.”</P><P>Kairi
gave her a nod, and their way over the ocean was going well. A lot of
spells later, Naminè was pretty burned out. Kairi had even taken
over for a short period and tried to freeze a bit with Blizzara
magic, but more than a few feett in total wasn't possible for her.</P><P>“We're
almost there,” Olette said and pointed at some point in the air.</P><P>Kairi
let the light ray emit again and indeed, they were only about hundred
feet away from the portal.</P><P>“One
or two more spells and we're there, Naminè. You're doing a great
job.”</P><P>She
really was. Kairi hadn't thought she had that much power. When she
learned to channel her power more accurately, Naminè would be a big
help. Olette did her own job, too. Whenever a Heartless dared to even
stick his head out of the water, she was there to kill it.</P><P>“I
think this is far enough.”</P><P>That
voice didn't belong to any of them, but Kairi knew to whom it did.
What she had feared for most was really happening, and in the worst
possible moment too.</P><P>When
Kairi turned around, a blond man was standing behind them, waiting
for them. The way back to the island had been cut off. The ice was
gone.</P><P>“The
Organization,” Kairi whispered.</P><P>“We
need to get away from here. We can't fight on this ground!” Olette
responded.</P><P>“I
doubt we'll manage that. The way to the portal is too far to swim,
too far to walk or use spells to freeze. This isn't looking good.”</P>
