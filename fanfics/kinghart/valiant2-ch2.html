<h1>Valiant Hearts II (part 2 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kinghart/index.html">Kingdom Hearts</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yuritale.html">Yuritale</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kinghart/valiant2-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><p align='center'><i>The Presence I Feel</i></p><p>Back in Hollow Bastion, Kairi had just 
woken up and was a bit confused by last night's dream, and started looking for her cell 
phone.</p><p>After seeing the clock and carefully looking a second time, the girl jumped out 
of bed and hurried to get dressed so she could get on her way to the meeting point down in 
the canyon. She, of all people, had overslept. And not by just a bit.</p><p>“Ah, Yuffie's 
totally gonna pick on me for being a sleepyhead.”</p><p>Kairi rushed through the residential 
sector of Hollow Bastion, through the rough alley that connected the residential quarters 
with the Castle and the maw, and made it finally to the point where the recently unblocked 
keyhole portal was.</p><p>All of them stood before the portal. The universal links between 
worlds that only a single person and the Keyblade, along with a machine built by Cid, could 
open for a limited time. Each world had several of these gateways to make traveling between 
the worlds possible. It was the one and only way to leave a world or enter one. The unknown 
enemy probably didn't possess knowledge of this. The portal itself was just about as big as 
the fist of a grown man, therefore they were hard to find.</p><p>None of them said anything 
about Kairi being late. Aerith had probably informed everyone that the red-haired girl had 
been training nonstop for the past few days. Still a bit embarrassed, she looked at the 
others, and all of them gave her a short nod.</p><p>Kairi pointed her Keyblade, the 
Oathkeeper, toward the portal. For the blink of an eye nothing happened, but then the 
Keyblade emitted a small ray of light that flowed into the shimmering portal. The gateway 
grew and grew until it was the size of a barn door, big enough to let three of them pass 
side by side.</p><p>The path between worlds was a narrow one that didn't allow one to stray 
from it. It looked like a window that would lead into the darkness between the worlds 
itself.</p><p>First to go through was a miserable-looking Cloud, who had been found by Tifa 
at the last moment. He was followed by Cid, who was armed with a lance, a bag full of 
explosives, and other technical things. Next was the pair of Yuffie, who looked very 
excited, and Leon, who had the usual silent pondering expression. Last were Tifa and Aerith, 
who had the job of protecting Kairi in case of an emergency.</p><p>The corridor was 
extraordinarily long, but the most unusual thing was that there were no enemies, no 
Heartless, nothing along the way whatsoever. Since the paths were unprotected and out in the 
dark, they were usually filled with Heartless.</p><p>It was Tifa who first noted the 
emptiness of the path.</p><p>“Is it just me, or does this feel wrong? Usually Kairi and one 
of us have to slaughter through legions of weak Heartless who downright cling to those 
paths, waiting to enter a world.”</p><p>Not one of them responded. The answer was 
obvious.</p><p>After a timeless period—it could have been hours, or just a few minutes, for 
outside the worlds there existed no true time—they arrived in a world that looked different 
from anything any of them had ever seen.</p><p>It resembled a big town that was much further 
advanced in technology than even Hollow Bastion, but was seemingly deserted. There was no 
sign of life or movement as far they could see. According to Yuffie, there should have been 
hordes of the white creatures she had described. Yet there was nothing.</p><p>They all 
looked around, not too far away from the portal, but couldn't find anything that even 
remotely resembled those beings. The black-haired ninja was on a rampage and started to 
swear that she hadn't made it all up. Aerith, true to nature, reassured her. Yuffie wasn't 
the kind of girl who made such stories up just to get attention. Well…maybe she was. But 
this was real. It just seemed weird that nothing was there.</p><p>“Maybe it's a trap,” noted 
Leon, looking over to Yuffie.</p><p>“They probably found out a spy was here and deserted the 
place," mumbled Tifa, loud enough to let Yuffie hear it.</p><p>“So you're saying it's my 
fault? That I wasn't discreet enough? That I failed the mission?” snapped the black-haired 
girl.</p><p>Nobody said anything. Kairi wanted to comfort her, but she wasn't really happy 
about the fact that they’d all come here for nothing.</p><p>Yuffie ran away in a fury, tears 
in her eyes, and Aerith sent Tifa a disapproving glare. As her assigned partner, Leon had no 
choice but to go after her. After another sigh, he slowly walked after the hurt 
woman.</p><p>In the meantime, Cid had vanished somewhere else, probably looking for a 
computer terminal of some sort to access the technology here. If there was something new in 
terms of technology, the smoking man was like a wild beast. There was no chain or leash that 
could hold him back.</p><p>There was no sign of Cloud whatsoever. Most likely he had gone to 
look around, or more precisely, looking for a trace of his arch-nemesis.</p><p>Tifa and 
Aerith sighed, kind of disgusted that everyone was so careless and excited about this place, 
and stood still for a moment as they realized that even Kairi had vanished. Both of them 
were standing not too far away from the portal that had already closed, and so they began to 
look around. There was absolutely nothing here. It seemed more than just weird that this 
place was so empty. Both women slowly walked further into the weird world, in the direction 
of a skyscraper.</p><p>It was then that Tifa uttered those famous last words.</p><p>“Well, 
this place seems deserted. I highly doubt they will get into any danger.”</p><p>Just seconds 
later, something triggered her evasive sense and she realized that she should have known 
better than to say that there was no danger lurking around here.</p><p>More out of intuition 
than anything, Tifa jumped to her right, and in the blink of an eye something passed by the 
place she had been standing an instant before. That was no coincidence. They had been 
waiting for the group to split up.</p><p>Something had pierced the 
ground.</p><p>"Knives…damn it, we've been had," swore Tifa, and she glanced around to find 
the perpetrator of the attack.</p><p>Aerith was confused for a moment, but when she saw the 
knives still crackling with electricity, the woman knew immediately what was going on. 
Unfortunately she had a problem of her own that prevented her from looking for the aggressor 
who had ambushed Tifa.</p><p>A storm of flower petals was coming towards her at a rapid 
speed. There was no doubt in her mind that those weren't normal flower petals. Aerith 
blocked them barely in time with a quickly recited Firega spell, but the impact was strong 
enough to send her flying, giving the other attacker the opportunity to start their own 
fight with Tifa.</p><p>A woman, blond-haired, and dressed in the same black robes that 
Yuffie had described, was aiming at the martial arts specialist with another pair of knives 
that emitted enough electricity to make it visible to the naked eye.</p><p>“Zexion was 
right. These intruders are no amateurs. She was able to dodge my attack solely based on 
instinct!” the blonde told her partner over her shoulder.</p><p>Aerith was standing again. 
She first shielded herself with a reflect spell, then looked to see who had sent that huge 
petal storm.</p><p>A man with the most evil and twisted face she had ever seen was floating 
above her, aiming his next attack. He had wild, unkempt hair of a faint pink color, wielded 
a enormous scythe, and had a smirk that would cause normal people to fall ill.</p><p>“Do not 
worry. These are just small fries. The Superior will be pleased if we dispatch them. He will 
have trust in us again, and then our plan will succeed,” said the man. His voice was sharp 
and poisonous, even disgusting to the ears of the women.</p><p>This wasn't looking too 
good.</p><p>Tifa, in the meantime, had launched her first brutal punches and kicks onto the 
fragile-looking woman. Surprised by the speed and force the black-haired woman put into 
action, she tried to put some distance between Tifa and herself, but failed. She wouldn't 
have stood a snowball's chance in hell against Tifa if she hadn't been able to 
float.</p><p>“Larxene, what the hell are you doing?! Kill her at once!” roared the 
scythe-wielding man.</p><p>“That's easier said than done, Marluxia! She’s like some 
ridiculous speed and power monster!” the woman yelled back.</p><p>Larxene fled in direction 
of the skyscraper and upwards. She couldn't reach Tifa with her knives from here, but she 
could think over how to fight against such a deadly combination of speed and 
force.</p><p>Aerith had her own problems. The man—his name seemed to be Marluxia—had 
extraordinary spell power and seemed to wield his weapon just as excellently. However, he 
did not show even a single sign of defense magic. He had to avoid all of the attack spells 
that she sent against him.</p><p>Aerith dominated the fight. Marluxia wasn't able to fully 
penetrate her reflect spell, and seemed not to have any defensive magic himself. One clean 
hit from a powerful Firaga and he would probably bite the dust.</p><p>Which was easier said 
than done. Not only was he floating through air like a bird, he also had too much speed for 
Aerith to hit him with any given spell. She desperately looked for a opening but couldn't 
find one. Her only hope was to hold out until Tifa had finished her fight and kept the man 
busy so that she could aim with a very strong spell like Ultima or something 
similar.</p><p>Much further away, something similar was going on. Deep in the Castle, way 
beyond the skyscraper, Cid had penetrated quite a few security locks. He had found a room 
full of electronic devices, with side rooms and even a way upstairs. He had managed to 
access a computer terminal and had already broken the security passwords. The blond was 
actually downloading the complete database of this world. Current progress was at seven 
percent.</p><p>Not only the two women had been assaulted. A man with a giant shield that was 
staggered with spikes all over it, long blond hair, a really displeased expression, and the 
obvious black robe, had forced Cid to fight.</p><p>Since he had already initiated the 
download of this world’s data, he was ready for all-out combat, which was why the displeased 
expression of his enemy just got worse.</p><p>While the unknown man in black seemed to 
freely control ice and sent icicles at him and even morning stars made of granite-hard ice, 
Cid parried the first with just his lance and blew up the morning stars.</p><p>With the 
proper evil-villain smirk, Cid threw something in the direction of the other man and ran for 
cover. The shield-wielder took cover too, but nothing happened.</p><p>“Seems you're out of 
ammo, cockroach!” yelled the man with the black robe, and fell into roaring laughter. Now 
was his time!</p><p>He took down his shield and started to run towards where Cid had taken 
cover. Cid, however, smirked and drew a little device out of his bag. Moments after a quiet 
click and a small beeping sound, a veracious explosion shook the whole castle and sent the 
black-robed man flying across the room, where he hit the wall.</p><p>Aerith was still par on 
par with Marluxia. While he had been unable to penetrate her defenses, he was just too fast 
for her to take aim properly. She had tried to send Thunderga all over the place, but the 
man had protected himself with a barrier of flower petals.</p><p>On the other hand, Marluxia 
wasn't able to go near the woman to get a clean hit. The moment he did, she would blow him 
up with some ridiculously strong magic.</p><p>“Tifa! I really could need some help here!” 
called Aerith to her girlfriend. But Tifa had disappeared. Quite freaked out, Aerith looked 
for her, seeing her not too far away from the skyscraper.</p><p>In fact, Larxene was still 
on the roof of the skyscraper, and the martial artist didn't think it favorable to take the 
lift. She was running at her maximum speed in direction of the tower and aiming at the outer 
wall.</p><p>“<i>Be GONE, damn tower!!”</i> roared the woman, and set a Limit Attack on the 
tower wall. She had initially intended to save this up for the actual fight, but without a 
place to run, the blond woman wouldn't stand too long. With that, Tifa landed the most 
devastating punch on the skyscraper Aerith had ever witnessed.</p><p>The whole base level of 
the tower crumbled under the enormous force that was applied to its structure. The martial 
artist didn't think it was enough and set another immense punch after it, which completely 
destroyed the outer wall of the first two floors, shaking the whole tower.</p><p>By that 
time, Larxene noticed that her hideout was about to be scrapped and she jumped off of it, 
directly into the arms of something else.</p><p>“No escaping anymore!” yelled Tifa, and 
landed a direct hit with a brutal kick on the neck of the blond. Larxene dropped to the 
ground without any further resistance and stopped moving.</p><p>“Damn it, Larxene!!” roared 
Marluxia, now alone. He disarmed himself, dropping his scythe, and lifted his hands behind 
his head.</p><p>“I surrender. Don't kill me. I can be useful to you!” swore the man. He was 
hoping they were foolish enough to fall for the trick.</p><p>Tifa didn't seem to believe him 
and was about to beat the hell out of him when the crumbling tower sent massive fragments 
all over the place, forcing her to evade a big part of the wall in the last second, and she 
let her guard down for a moment.</p><p>That was the chance Marluxia had been waiting for! If 
it was only the spellcaster woman, he could still win this battle!</p><p>The man picked up 
his scythe and rushed with crazy speed in Tifa's direction. She wouldn't have the time to 
evade this.</p><p>“<i>You're dead, WOMAN!!!”</i> barked the man, and aimed his strike for 
her head.</p><p>Seconds before he could land the deadly strike, something massive came onto 
him, something no living being would be able to survive if it made a direct hit. Aerith had 
fired an Ultima spell on the man, hoping that her girlfriend was fast enough to get out of 
the detonation zone.</p><p>A massive explosion shook the place, making not only the 
skyscraper finally collapse, but also shaking the other buildings. Marluxia was, without a 
doubt, dead. Not even the black robe was left after the magic force vanished. Tifa somehow 
managed to get away, but still got hit by the result of Aerith's spell.</p><p>“Are you okay, 
Aerith?” Tifa asked in a quite anxious voice. It hadn't been in a long, long time that she 
had fired an Ultima. It was extremely draining and demanding.</p><p>“Somehow, yes. And you? 
I hope I didn't hit you with it. Are you okay?” Aerith was no less anxious. If Tifa had been 
caught up in that spell, she would most likely have killed her too.</p><p>“I'm fine. 
Somehow. But I'm exhausted to no end.”</p><p>A ridiculous explosion demanded their 
attention. It was strong enough to shake even the buildings around them, and they couldn’t 
even sense the origin of it. It must have been too far away.</p><p>“I guess Cid's 
experiments with those explosives were not for nothing,” said Tifa.</p><p>They all knew that 
the blond had been experimenting with explosives ever since they had sealed Kingdom Hearts. 
One time he almost blew up Merlin's house. Another time, he had actually increased the 
canyon's size.</p><p>“What about the woman you were fighting?” asked Aerith. She wanted to 
make sure that there wouldn't be any wicked surprises when they weren't looking.</p><p>Tifa 
waved in the direction of the now totally collapsed tower. Somewhere under it lay the 
woman.</p><p>“I most likely broke her neck. She didn't seem like the type that would survive 
such a kick.”</p><p>Unable to decide where to go, both of them decided to trust in the 
others. Their only concern was Kairi. “Will she be all right?” Aerith asked.</p><p>Her 
girlfriend waved it aside. “She is a big girl. Don't forget she was the one who beat the 
hell out of Ansem and sealed Kingdom Hearts.”</p><p>Aerith really wasn't sure if that was 
supposed to ease her worries.</p><p>In a completely different area, not so far away from 
Cid, Cloud walked through the Castle. He was looking for anything or anyone that could have 
a relation to Sephiroth. However, seemingly, there was not anything or anyone here at 
all.</p><p>He had arrived in a totally empty room. There was nothing but giant windows, and 
in the middle of this place was a cage But even that was empty.</p><p>When he tried to 
leave, someone was standing in the way. The robe’s hood was drawn around his face, was armed 
with a sword that rivaled that of Cloud’s in regards to size. The being leveled that 
sword—held with just one hand— at the blond man.</p><p>“This is your end,” said the unknown. 
It was a man, and on top of that, he had a voice as calm and confident as granite.</p><p>“I 
don't have the time to play with you. I'm looking for a certain someone,” replied 
Cloud.</p><p>A weird sensation, a pressure you would only feel if you fought someone as 
strong as you, a tension you simply could not ignore, floated through the 
room.</p><p>Shortly after, heavy sounds of swords clashing filled the air.</p><p>At the 
entrance of the castle, Leon and Yuffie had just finished their easiest fight in a long 
time. A man with blue hair, armed with…a giant book, and the same black robe the others 
wore, was lying dead on the ground. He was wounded at several points, from both the gunblade 
of the brown-haired man and also the oversized shuriken that the ninja used.</p><p>They both 
had been taken by a surprise attack which was awfully weak. It was, at best, a middle-class 
magic that even the man with the scar across his face would have been able to cast. They 
both couldn't believe that one of these new enemies was that weak.</p><p>He had been just 
all talk, babbling something about a great plan of creating the Heart of Hearts, their great 
ringleader Xemnas, how all of the others had probably been killed by his 
companions.</p><p>He died after both Leon and Yuffie had had enough of his arrogant 
attitude.</p><p>“If every of them is just as weak, the others have surely finished their 
fights already,” said Leon. He sighed and thought of what might happen to the others if 
their enemies were much stronger.</p><p>“We should look to see how the others are doing. 
Let's first check on the portal. It'll be fatal if we're trapped here,” proposed Yuffie, and 
without waiting for an answer, she ran past her partner in the direction of where the 
skyscraper had once stood.</p><p align='center'>---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>Further away than 
everyone else from the portal was Kairi. She had left the seemingly usual pathways of this 
world and had found, way beyond the castle, a tower, a fortress. Golden in color and 
oddly-shaped, she had found it to be just as deserted as the rest of this 
world.</p><p>However, there was something that had been driving her to get here. And now, it 
was calling out to her. It was calling out to her to come inside, to come all the way up to 
the top floor.</p><p>Kairi was hesitant about this. What if this was a trap? But she felt 
that she just had to go there.</p><p>The floors were deserted, made of blank white stone, 
and pillars lined the hallways. The actual floors were all made of lots of rooms, all 
somehow detached by a closed door. Each time the redhead reached one of the closed doors, 
she had to switch the keychains to find the right one. The doors only opened if they were 
beaten by the right Keyblade.</p><p>Shortly after the fourth floor, there was a change in 
the sensation that Kairi had been feeling since she entered the fortress. It was…familiar, 
yet strangely alien to her. No matter what was waiting on the top floor, she had to see 
it.</p><p>It took her not too long until the pattern of the doors became clear. Most of the 
doors opened to just one specific Keyblade. There were three different kinds of doors: red 
doors, white doors and yellow doors. While the red ones could be opened with Oathkeeper and 
Oblivion, both of which were Keyblades she linked to memories of her childhood friends, the 
others didn't show any reaction to those.</p><p>The white doors reacted to Monochrome only, 
while the yellow ones only reacted to Hero’s Crest.</p><p>“I've never heard of such a 
place…locks that only react to certain Keyblades. And why are there so many of them anyway?” 
Kairi asked out aloud. It was quite a weird place.</p><p>However, once she reached the tenth 
floor, a colossal earthquake shook the place for more than twenty seconds. Pillars crashed 
into the walls, making the hallway slowly crumble.</p><p>As the quake ended, Kairi found 
herself cut off from the entrance. It was completely buried by the fallen stone 
pillars.</p><p>To make it worse, some of the creatures Yuffie had mentioned started to crawl 
out of holes, while some just appeared out of the ground. Summoning Oathkeeper, Kairi was 
ready to fight.</p><p>There were two kinds. One that seemed fragile and quite weak, while 
the others were giant monsters, armed huge swords.</p><p>Not losing any time, Kairi started 
to thin their lines with Thundra magic. It worked better than she’d expected. The weaker 
ones instantly bit the dust, but the bigger ones didn't seem to take any damage from such an 
attack.</p><p>Five of those bigger ones blocked the way to the next floor. There was no way 
back.</p><p>With a sudden rush, Kairi hit the first with a frontal hit, followed by another 
line-up of hits, taking the beast by surprise. Not wasting the momentum, she jumped on its 
head and plunged the Keyblade into its back. The monster fell and vanished into 
nothingness.</p><p>But that wouldn't work against the remaining four. The Keyblade-wielding 
girl desperately looked for something that could be used against those things, then noticed 
the one she had just slain had dropped its sword before it vanished.</p><p>Without 
hesitation, Kairi lifted it with a Gravity spell and sent it flying in direction of the 
others. It smashed into the others, hitting them before dropping to the ground, and stunned 
them for a moment.</p><p>Not challenging her luck, the girl jumped over them and made her 
way to the next floor.</p><p>It was weird, because again, there was absolutely nothing. And 
when Kairi looked back, there weren't even the silver-like things she had just 
defeated.</p><p>“Something isn't right here,” noted Kairi, and started to run again. That 
is, she ran until another earthquake made the whole place tremble. There were terrible 
sounds, and apparently some of the lower floors began to collapse. The only way left to her 
was to go forward.</p><p>The hallways still looked the same, and it must have been the 
eleventh floor already. And now there wasn't even a way upstairs anymore. She looked around, 
desperately looking for something to escape from this wicked place.</p><p>And she found a 
way. Not so far away, there was another door that apparently led outside.</p><p>Kairi was 
standing on a bridge, high above ground—at least a hundred and fifty feet. There was no way 
she would survive a jump or fall from this altitude. However, on the other side there was a 
small tower that had been built separately from the original fortress. It didn't look like 
there were any actual rooms below this floor in there, but she just had to try 
it.</p><p>Slowly crossing the bridge, another earthquake, even worse than the first and the 
second, shook the place. The bridge wouldn't hold another quake!</p><p>Kairi hurried to the 
door, slamming her fists against it. Locked. It was to be expected. But this door, although 
white, didn't budge to Monochrome. No matter which Keyblade Kairi tried, the door didn't 
budge a bit. It would only be been a matter of time until the next quake came, and if she 
was still on that bridge, she wouldn’t be able to take cover anywhere.</p><p>There must have 
been a magic lock or something like that on that door. However, Kairi had learned that there 
was still another way in if a door was locked.</p><p>Very carefully, Kairi stood on the 
ledge of the bridge, climbing along the oddly-shaped outer wall of the tower, over to where 
she guessed a window was.</p><p>The quake came earlier than expected. Kairi held herself 
with all her might on the wall, knowing that a fall from this height would kill just about 
anyone. On top of all this, to make it even worse, the wall not far from her started to 
crumble.</p><p>It was a do-or-die situation.</p><p>Kairi swallowed and jumped, trying to 
reach the window that was about two meters away. It looked really bad, and in the same 
moment the red-haired girl got a hold of the windowsill, it broke off.</p><p>It was a weird 
feeling that suddenly rushed through her. She was falling, falling over hundred and fifty 
feet, rushing with terrible speed towards the ground.</p><p>Closing her eyes, Kairi waited 
for the impact.</p><p>However, even after a minute—and such a distance didn't take a minute 
to fall through—there was no impact.</p><p>When Kairi opened her eyes, she was in the same 
bright white room she had seen in her dream the previous night. Was this heaven? Or was this 
all still part of her dream? If so, it was the worst and most realistic dream ever. However, 
the room was the very same room from her dreams.</p><p>And no one was there.</p><p>Kairi 
looked around and walked slowly to the window. The view almost made her speechless. Just out 
of this very window was the very same castle she had been in a few moments ago, crumbling 
and some of its parts collapsing. It was not a dream!</p><p>But who had rescued her? 
Who?</p><p>“Who rescued me?” Kairi asked out loud.</p><p>And this time, there was an answer. 
“A friend did.”</p><p>Somewhere, someone, <i>something</i> in this room answered.</p><p>A 
gentle and calm voice. The voice of a girl. The voice that had screamed “help me” in her 
dreams.</p><p>Kairi moved around, looking into every corner, looking on the ceiling, the 
ground, under the table. There was no one there. Had she lost her mind?</p><p>“Is this a 
dream…or not…?” asked the girl, not expecting an answer, but to calm herself.</p><p>“It's 
very real. In fact, you almost died. You would have died if I not had asked my friend to 
save you,” answered the voice.</p><p>A very agitated Kairi moved aimlessly around the room. 
There was no one here! How could someone answer her?</p><p>“Who are you? Why did you save 
me? Why can't I see you? Who is your friend? What is going on here?” asked Kairi in a rush. 
She had to know, or else she would lose her sanity.</p><p>The voice giggled. It was kind of 
cute, and despite her situation, Kairi had to smile. It was a kind and cute giggle, not 
making fun of her, but amused.</p><p>“Who I am, I don't know. But you can call me Naminè. 
And I saved you because I felt that it was the right thing to do. My friend's name I can't 
give you, I'm sorry. But…I'm right here…” and with that, the voice ended her 
speech…</p><p>Something was there. Right in front of her. Kairi could feel it. It was…as if 
she were simply blind. Closing her eyes, she reached out with her hand.</p><p>And there was 
the body that owned the voice! She had soft, fair skin, and from what Kairi could feel, 
shoulder-length hair.</p><p>She was a bit frightened when the other girl—her name 
was…Naminè?—did the same, touching her cheek and starting to giggle.</p><p>It was an 
intimate moment, and Kairi would have asked a lot of questions if not for another quake that 
shook the room and let a part of the ceiling come down. Reflexively, Kairi jumped back, 
hoping that the other girl hopefully did the same.</p><p>“Naminè…are you all right?” asked 
the Keyblader in the room. There no answer for about a minute.</p><p>Then, a voice in her 
head answered. “I'm okay, but I have to go. See you again, Kairi.”</p><p>She hadn’t told the 
girl her name.</p><p>“How do you know—” Kairi asked, she but stopped midways. If that girl 
could penetrate her mind, it should have been an easy task for Naminè to find out her 
name.</p><p>“You need to go now. A friend will—” was the last thing the voice said before 
Kairi felt an unbearable pain in her head and lost consciousness.</p><p>When she got back to 
her senses, she was being carried. “Where…who…?” asked Kairi, still a bit dazed. She got her 
answer immediately. It was Tifa's voice, and it was also her who carried Kairi.</p><p>“A guy 
in a black robe carried you from somewhere. When we found him, he just handed you over and 
vanished into the dark. What the hell did you do?” Tifa seemed quite angry. Well, that was 
to be expected. Kairi had almost died two times in that wicked place, and they didn't even 
know that yet.</p><p>Not until now had Kairi noticed that they were running. Aerith, Yuffie, 
Leon, and a quite demolished Cloud were all running in the direction she believed the portal 
to be</p><p>“Why are we running?” she asked.</p><p>It was Yuffie who first broke out into 
roaring laughter, holding her side, gasping for air. Leon just sighed again, and Cloud was 
probably too exhausted to answer.</p><p>“Cid totally overdid it with his explosives. 
Apparently, he blew up some really important generator, and now the whole place is shaking, 
crumbling and what the heck,” answered a now even more angry Tifa.</p><p>Cid was the only 
one missing here. Kairi suddenly asked herself where he was.</p><p>“Where is he? Don't tell 
me…did he…blow…himself…?” stammered the redhead.</p><p>Yuffie laughed even harder, and Leon 
had to carry her the rest of the way. He didn't think it was that funny.</p><p>“He's fine. 
Just finishing some file download or something,” answered Aerith.</p><p>In the room with the 
computer terminal that Cid had been working on, the whole floor was covered and lined with 
ice shards and craters. Not so far away was the man in the black robe, lying in such a 
crater.</p><p>Cid had finally gotten him with a surprise attack and had stabbed him with his 
lance. He hadn't aimed for his heart or his head, but for his shield. He had impaled it, 
making the lance stuck on it. The smoker had put quite a few explosives in the peak of his 
weapon. With a terrible explosion, the fight had come to an end. Nobody could have survived 
such a detonation at point-blank range.</p><p>His downloading had taken some damage. The 
current progress had been at twenty-three percent and the explosion had canceled the 
download at this point.</p><p>Cid himself was running as fast as he could. During his fight, 
he had blown up a device that was close to the computer terminal and had triggered a chain 
reaction. A whole part of the wall blew up, leaving quite a hole in it.</p><p>Another 
mistake of Cid's was responsible for the explosive that flew through that hole and landed in 
a labyrinth of cables, absolutely impossible to reach. It was a matter of time until that 
thing's heat triggered the detonation process of Cid's bomb and sent the whole thing to 
hell.</p><p>The whole place would take fatal damage when that generator exploded. “I better 
hurry. I don't want to be here when that thing blows up.”</p><p>The others were already 
waiting in front of the portal, quite worried that their first trip to this world had been 
this bad. While Tifa and Aerith, in their role as parents, looked after an injured Kairi, 
Leon was busy with sighing, and Yuffie had passed out from laughter. Cloud just sat 
silently, leaned on a wall, and seemed to sleep.</p><p>It was Leon who first saw Cid, and 
asked Kairi to open the portal. He already knew the expression on the face of the artificer. 
It was the “Jesus Christ, this whole place is going to go kaboom” expression.</p><p>The 
whole group had heard that one line multiple times, and it was the signal to run as fast as 
they could.</p><p>Kairi was quite exhausted, and first off, she had even forgotten to change 
the keychain to Oathkeeper and tried to open the portal with the wrong Keyblade.</p><p>Cid, 
in the meanwhile, had made it back to the group in one piece and earned annoyed glares from 
everyone. He was quite offended by it and tried to justify his actions.</p><p>“Hey, I was 
attacked! Should I have let myself get killed?”</p><p>Nobody said anything and just 
continued to glare. The blond scratched the back of his head and shrugged. In the end, they 
all forgave him. In the end.</p><p>The portal was fully open when a colossal detonation 
demanded their attention. Far away, the castle they could barely see was obscured by the 
greatest explosion they had ever seen. Everyone looked at Cid for a second, then hurried 
through the portal.</p><p>Not so for Kairi. She just stood there, looking in the direction 
where she had found the fortress. She was suddenly worried if they had safely escaped. There 
was no guarantee that this world would survive this.</p><p>Way closer than before, another 
explosion occurred. It was seemingly a chain reaction.</p><p>Kairi, stunned by the thought 
that the other girl, that Naminè, might not have escaped, made the attempt to run 
back.</p><p>“Don't go there. I'm safe. Hurry through the portal!” said a familiar voice in 
her head.</p><p>She stopped, turned around, and jumped through the portal at the last 
moment. Just the blink of an eye later, and the next of the generator’s explosions would 
have blown her up.</p><p>The portal crumbled behind her and closed itself. This one was most 
likely destroyed and could never be restored. All of the others just stood there, saying 
nothing.</p><p>The group looked at her as if she just had done something infinitely stupid. 
Then Kairi realized what she had been about to do back there. A rather shocked expression 
appeared on her face.</p><p>“What in the world happened just now? Where did you want to go?” 
asked Aerith. She had a very worried expression, and even Tifa looked rather 
anxious.</p><p>“That was really dangerous, Kairi…never do that again, you hear me?” the 
martial artist warned her adoptive daughter.</p><p>Kairi didn't know how to respond. Would 
they believe her? That there was some invisible girl who apparently could read her mind and 
who was imprisoned in that white room and who saved her life twice? Even though she had no 
proof that she ever existed? She decided against that. They would probably think that she 
had lost her mind.</p><p>Everyone else was still looking at her, expecting an 
answer.</p><p>“I don't know. It was just a weird feeling that we forgot something important. 
It felt like I was missing something,” lied Kairi, and looked at the 
ground.</p><p>Seemingly, most of the group accepted that answer and now asked themselves if 
they had forgotten something.</p><p>Not Aerith, though. She knew that Kairi was lying but 
didn't want to force her to tell in front of all people. They were all exhausted and tense 
from their fights and the situation.</p><p>Cloud had already vanished from view when Tifa 
looked around, and Leon was still carrying the ninja. She sighed, for once thinking that 
this had been already too long of a day, and started to take over the commanding part. Leon 
was too lost in his thoughts to lead them anywhere.</p><p>“Let's go back. We can't stand 
around here forever, and we all need rest. Also, Cid, no rest for you until you fully 
analyze the data you gained. I hope for your health that there is something of significance 
in those files,” said Tifa, and started to move.</p><p>The others agreed silently and 
followed her, with Cid being the last. He maintained something of a distance between himself 
and the others. They somewhat worried that he would really blow himself up someday. Kairi 
had been treated by Aerith with a Curaga spell and was feeling well enough to walk on her 
own.</p><p>On the other end of the path, Cloud was already awaiting the others. He was 
looking quite impatient to get through. Kairi opened the portal, and when the blond vanished 
almost immediately, Tifa let out a annoyed sigh.</p><p>“Him and his stupid search for 
Sephiroth. Will that ever have an end? It's been getting on my nerves for years now!” 
complained the woman, and just ran off in the direction of the uptown sector.</p><p>While 
Leon carried Yuffie to her apartment, going to his own afterwards to rest, and Cid hurrying 
to his computer, Kairi was held back by Aerith.</p><p>“What really happened?” the 
brown-haired woman asked quietly. It wasn't really in her nature to force Kairi to tell 
anything that happened, but this one had been pretty bad.</p><p>“You wouldn't believe it 
anyway. I don’t even believe it myself. I'll tell you when I get proof of what <i>really</i> 
happened,” replied Kairi, and they went on their way home, where Tifa was probably already 
cooking something awfully spicy to erase her bad mood.</p><p>Back at home, the smell in the 
air was a sign that confirmed her guess about Tifa cooking some inedible food…probably 
something that would burn holes into the wall. Kairi just walked upstairs to her room and 
fell onto her bed, looking at the ceiling like she had the previous evening.</p><p>“Was that 
all real? But…I really got carried away by someone in a black robe…and I just can't think of 
her as…unreal. I could feel her skin, could hear her voice…” noted Kairi.</p><p>She really 
couldn't think of a rational explanation for all that. Why couldn't she see her? 
Invisibility magic? Not likely. Something wrong with her eyes? But she could see the room 
just fine.</p><p>To distract herself, she played a bit with her keychains. "Oblivion…Hero’s 
Crest…Mono…no, wait…" counted Kairi.</p><p>Monochrome was missing!</p><p>“Damn it. I must 
have lost it back there. Either when I climbed outside the room…or…when I evaded the falling 
ceiling…or that black-robed man took it from me…" Kairi cursed her own carelessness. How 
could she have lost a keychain?</p><p>There was no way she could tell this to the others. 
They would blame her for being careless. But they were not the Heartless after all. Most 
likely, the pendant was somewhere in the ruins of that castle, submerged under tons of white 
stone.</p><p align='center'>---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>In a totally different place, the 
topic was not even remotely as different.</p><p>“Are you sure it's okay to keep that? I 
mean, after all, it belongs to her,” said a man with a black robe.</p><p>He was speaking to 
a girl with fair, shoulder-length blond hair who was holding something and had a childish 
smirk on her face. She was wearing a simple white dress paired with white 
sandals.</p><p>“Yeah. I don't think she really lost it. I think it wanted to stay here, that 
it wanted me to find it,” said the girl, and looked outside the window. Her view was that of 
a happy and peaceful town.</p><p>“Do you think we are safe here?” asked the girl.</p><p>The 
man slowly walked to the window. Standing there, he gave her a nod. Yes, this was the right 
thing to do. And he didn't care about his orders anymore.</p><p>“I think so. But it's only a 
matter of time before they find us and we'll have to run again,” replied the man.</p><p>That 
time would come faster than he had ever expected.</p>
