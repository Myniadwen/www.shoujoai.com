<h1>Valiant Hearts II (part 14 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kinghart/index.html">Kingdom Hearts</a>

<a href="../kinghart/valiant2-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><p align='center'><I>The
New Beginning -</I></P><p align='center'><I>A
Confrontation of Feelings?</I></P><P>Empty
hallways filled with the echoes of sinister screams. The whole
complex was abandoned, seemingly because of what was occurring in its
depths, in places where a normal visitor could not have gone. One
could only imagine what terror was waiting on the lowest levels.</P><P>“As
I said, failure shall not be tolerated.”</P><P>The
Superior was standing upright before Luxord, amidst a mass of
darkness, which was actually his quarters—a
half-destructed and empty hall. This was the place where he had
tortured the girl, and this was the place where he would punish those
who dared to defy him and those who failed to meet his expectations,
his orders.</P><P>And
Luxord had failed.</P><P>His
eyes were wide open in fear, fear of the things he was seeing inside
his head. His mind was put through unimaginable nightmares, his own
trickery made his greatest enemy. A hell of fear, desperation and
darkness waiting for him, and only occasionally, Xemnas decided to
lift the spell, allowing Luxord's mind to find itself back in
reality.</P><P>But
it was just another way to punish him, Luxord knew well that the
Superior was unforgiving and never showed any emotion. The gambler
swore to himself that if he somehow survived this without going
insane, those girls would pay for what he had to endure.</P><P>Xemnas
raised his hand, and it was the signal of yet another hell to come.
Not physical pain was it that Luxord feared, as his cards would aid
him there, but the terror. Terror to his mind, the one piece he could
not trick, not simply heal with his powers.</P><P>“<I>No!”</I></P><P>The
echo of his desperate scream reached even the most outer parts of the
complex, the vibe of his voice capable of warning everyone else what
awaited them if they failed like he had. That was Xemnas' greatest
weapon. Terror.</P><P>Hours
passed with Luxord being kept in his mental prison. He would only
last so long before his wall of sanity broke down, his mind losing
its shape and drifting into chaos.</P><P>The
darkness finally vanished, only gradually allowing Luxord to see the
real world again. Xemnas was still standing before him with a frozen
expression, an expression he kept always and at any time.</P><P>“Do
not fail me again.”</P><P>“Yes…”</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>None
of them had spoken a word since then. Kairi still thought about
Yuffie's message from the night before and was avoiding looking into
Naminè's and Olette's eyes. How should she answer? What should
she answer? Did Naminè know?</P><P>“I
was against it, but Leon is so ridiculously stubborn!“ Tifa
complained, standing in the kitchen and talking to her lover, who was
making some omelettes for the girls.</P><P>“You
don't need to yell. Save that for later, you're going to have to do
plenty of that if Leon pushes the matter too far,” Aerith said,
giving Tifa a <I>that is enough</I> look.</P><P>“I
know…but—!”</P><P>“No
buts. Here, have an omelette.”</P><P>Aerith
suppressed any further conversation by giving Tifa two plates of
breakfast and sending her over to the table, where the girls sat.</P><P>Olette
was still half-asleep, her head lying on the table. The whole night
she had thought about…it. Naminè wasn't in good shape and was
resting her arms on the table, holding up her head. Overusing magic
often caused headaches over days. Kairi had gotten very little sleep
and was leaning back in her chair, opposite to Olette, thinking so
hard that she didn't even notice Tifa putting a plate in front of
her.</P><P>“They
look terrible. I'm going to tell Leon that—”</P><P>“He
won't be listening, Tifa. The earlier they're over it, the better. I
want to forget about it too, so please, could you give it a rest?”</P><P>Aerith
was slightly annoyed at the persistence of her lover so early in the
morning. She didn't like the idea of the girls reporting in the day
after they had gotten home either, but Leon was still their leader.</P><P>“Some
leader he is…” Tifa muttered. She sat down at the table and
started sulking.</P><P>The
following silence was so awkward that Aerith stood up, walked over to
the living room and put on a CD, even though she didn't like music at
breakfast. The song was “Twilight Treats” by Thorn of a Rose, one
of Aerith's favorite artists.</P><P>A
few seconds into the song, Olette moved, seemingly slowly waking up
completely from her half-asleep state.</P><P>“Hey…I
know that song. Where did you get it?”</P><P>“Leon
gave it to me. He got it from…well, sort of a friend. Or so he
says.”</P><P>Aerith
remembered exactly which friend and where Leon got it. But if she
told Olette, she would probably ask Leon, and if there was one thing
to avoid, it was questioning Leon's past.</P><P>“Hm…”</P><P>“How
do you know it?”</P><P>Naminè
was only half-present, Kairi still deep in thought but subconsciously
eating breakfast with Tifa, who was already on her second bagel and
watching Aerith, who had, out of the four, the most graceful manners.
Or manners at all.</P><P>“Just…from
home. I guess. I don't really remember, but when I hear it, I think
of a certain someone. It doesn't feel pleasant to think about her,
though. She and her friends had always been a pain. Somewhat, I
guess.”</P><P>Olette
tried to forget about it and just continued to listen to the song,
starting on her breakfast.</P><P>“Naminè,
you don't like eggs?”</P><P>Aerith
was worried about her apprentice. Had she gone over her limits in the
past few days and suffered some permanent damage? Or was she just
still tired?</P><P>“Oh,
I just…I have a headache,” Naminè explained, but then picked up
her breakfast. A slight cough escaped her. She still wasn't
completely healed, but it was much better thanks to Aerith.</P><P>“If
that is all, then you're going to be okay. The cure magic I used
gives your immune system a strong boost, so you should be fine soon.
Don't get sick again, please.”</P><P>Aerith
was happy that it had worked so well. Naminè had been sick, and to
cut it down to just a cold and occasional coughing was much more than
she had hoped for. Usually the human body wasn't able to recover that
quickly.</P><P>The
atmosphere was tense and none of them wanted to start any
conversation. They would have to speak a lot later, when they had to
report every detail to Leon.</P><P>“Everything
is going to be okay, you four.”</P><P>Aerith
had long finished her food, and looked from one girl to another,
finally stopping at Tifa.</P><P>“Why
am I included in the list?” She was still sulking.</P><P>“Because
right now, you're acting worse than the others.”</P><P>Tifa
began to sulk even harder. “That's not true. You're just being mean
for no reason.”</P><P>Everyone
finished eating and Aerith collected the plates, giving them
forcefully to Tifa. “If I'm so mean, here. Go and wash the dishes
so you don't have to suffer anymore.”</P><P>It
was a smile of the devil. Tifa knew that arguing with her right now
was useless. They were all not quite happy that Leon had ordered the
girls to report the day after they had come back, ignoring their poor
conditions.</P><P>Aerith
just stood behind Tifa, drying the wet plates. The night before, they
had talked long into the night about what to do with the girls. For
the first time in months, they had had a serious argument.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Tifa
was leaning on the door, arms crossed and wearing a stony expression.
After her initial happiness, she was mad. Really mad. Kairi had run
away, got herself almost killed and hadn't told her or Aerith about
it. And now Aerith disagreed with her that they'd need to punish
Kairi for the act.</P><P>“Do
you plan on letting her get away with this sort of thing?”</P><P>Aerith
was sitting on the bed, looking straight at Tifa, hands resting on
her lap. She knew why Tifa was mad. She felt the same, yet different.
Kairi was sorry, they both knew it, but Tifa still insisted on
punishing her, even if it only served an educational purpose. Aerith
was more lax on her, which was weak, in Tifa's opinion.</P><P>“No,
but I don't think punishing her is what we should do. She, and we
too, suffered enough already. We should make clear to Kairi that she
doesn't have to hide anything from us, that she can talk to us if she
has worries.”</P><P>“But
that's the same as letting her off the hook! I know she is sorry, and
I'm not saying we should punish her that much…at least restrict her
freedom for a few days. I don't want to see her hurt, and until I'm
absolutely sure that she will talk to us next time, I want her to be
always in sight.”</P><P>Aerith
let out a sigh and shook her head slightly. Tifa was stubborn, but
not dumb. It was just that she couldn't let go of the thought that
Kairi might do something stupid again.</P><P>“You
want to make Kairi a prisoner in this house? Look, Tifa…I want
Kairi to trust us, and I think you want it too, but confining her
inside the house would only make it worse. She would feel like we're
doubting her more than ever, holding her prisoner. I see your point,
but your method is wrong.”</P><P>Tifa
angrily hit the door. Why was Aerith so against her? She was always
so easygoing with Kairi! Sure, she had a point, but…but…</P><P>“If
we always overlook whatever she does, one day, the thing we fear most
will happen. She'll get herself into trouble and won't come back!“
Tifa yelled at Aerith.</P><P>It
had been ages since Tifa had yelled at Aerith. They were a very close
couple and almost never argued. Aerith would have won most arguments
anyway, and Tifa knew it. She was just weak against Aerith. But this
time, Tifa wouldn't back down. This was too important for her.</P><P>“Don't
you dare even think about that!” Aerith yelled back.</P><P>Tifa
was stunned by Aerith's outburst. She had never seen Aerith lose her
temper. The brunette woman covered her face with her hands. It was
unfair of Tifa to say something like that!</P><P>“Do
you think I don't care about Kairi? Do you?! If so, then please, open
your eyes, Tifa! I was just as worried as you were, but you're taking
a step back, not forward!”</P><P>Aerith
stood up and looked with fiery eyes at Tifa. The black-haired woman
couldn't stand that gaze. It was like her emerald eyes were piercing
right through her, looking inside her mind. Averting her face, Tifa
felt less angry than before. “It's just…I'm so worried that she
might do something like this again…she came back, but only thanks
to King Mickey. I don't even want to think about what would have
happened if he hadn't come by!”</P><P>Tifa
tried to keep her composure and not start crying. The thought of
Kairi vanishing for good was a bit much.</P><P>“It's
not like I'm not worrying! And please, don't talk about what would
have happened. I want this nightmare to end already. We should be
happy that she is back. I think…punishing her would only make it
worse.”</P><P>Aerith
had completely lost her usual calm attitude. She was drained and
angry. She hadn't been like this since her world had gotten destroyed
and she had lost many of her friends.</P><P>“So
what do you think we should do? Talk with her, that's all? I know
Kairi is not stupid, but I feel like just talking won't be enough.
Punishing her is also a way to show we care about her. Don't you get
it, Aerith? I want her to know that we care about her. Like…parents
care about their children.”</P><P>Aerith
understood what Tifa wanted, but still shook her head. It was useless
to force someone to understand others cared, and Tifa had to learn
that.</P><P>“I…know
we're not her real family, and she must be longing after her real
one, but…I love her just like she was my own child.”</P><P>Tifa
stepped forward and took Aerith's hands, closing her eyes. “I know
you feel the same. That's why I don't want to lose Kairi, no matter
what happens. I need her, just like I need you, Aerith…”</P><P>“Don't
tell Kairi that, she'd be scared for her life.” Aerith tried to
lighten up the mood. She hated fighting. Hated arguing.</P><P>It
took Tifa a moment to catch up, but she then blushed furiously. “I
didn't mean it <I>that way</I>! Gosh, you're a pervert, through and
through!”</P><P>Aerith
couldn't help but smile. It hurt her most when she was arguing with
Tifa or Kairi. She just couldn't stand it. She would do anything to
stop fighting with them. “I know. And you are telling me I'm a
pervert? I think I have to remind you of—”</P><P>“No,
you don't! God, if you ever mention that in front of Kairi,
I'll…I'll…”</P><P>“Explode
out of embarrassment, I bet.”</P><P>Tifa
couldn't help but look away, red as a ripe tomato. They still hadn't
found a solution to their argument, and Tifa would not let it go. But
her anger was mostly gone. Had that been her intention all along?</P><P>“I
still think just talking to her won't be enough. I want her to…stay
here for a while. Let her wounds heal and…I don't know, but I don't
want her to leave anytime soon!”</P><P>“I
know how you feel. But what you want to do would only make her feel
worse. We would be treating her like a rebellious child, and it would
only make things worse. It would make her feel like we don't trust
her the least.”</P><P>Tifa
had finally come to reason, and Aerith was happy that they could stop
arguing at last. Aerith got closer to Tifa, laying her arms around
Tifa's waist and pulling her even closer. Resting her head on Tifa's
shoulder, Aerith took a deep breath and closed her eyes, waiting for
Tifa to say the one sentence she wanted to hear. <I>'You were right,
my flower. I understand now.'</I></P><P>But
things don't always go like that.</P><P>“Your
hair reeks. When was the last time you took a bath?”</P><P>That
was not what she wanted to hear, and Aerith made a slightly angry
expression. “Talk about yourself. Your clothes smell like the
unspeakable. When did you last wash them?”</P><P>They
were teasing each other, both in silent understanding with each other
about what they would do with Kairi.</P><P>“You
mean <I>you</I> forgot to wash them! It's your week.”</P><P>Aerith
bit her lips. They were still standing like lovers who were about to
share a close moment, but once they started their game of tease and
be teased, there was no stopping it.</P><P>“And
who is always producing so much laundry that we have to wash—”</P><P>“At
least I'm not wearing those long dresses! They're a pain to wash.”</P><P>“You'd
look good in a dress, Tifa.”</P><P>“You
really think so? Hm…maybe I should borrow one of yours.”</P><P>“Absolutely
not. Not in a hundred years.”</P><P>“Stingy.”</P><P>“I
would lend you one, but I'm absolutely sure you'd give it back in
pieces.”</P><P>Tifa
went silent for a moment. Aerith was hard to beat at this, especially
because what she said was mostly true.</P><P>“Wait
a second…” Tifa took a deep sniff of Aerith's dress, followed by
an expression that could only be described as absolutely disgusted.
“It's not your hair that reeks…it's that ominous dress of yours!”</P><P>Aerith
went glaring red, like a child that was found out while stealing
candy. “It's not my fault! I forgot that it's my week, and ran out
of clean clothes!”</P><P>Tifa
had a devilish smile on her lips, like she had just won a fight. “So
you <I>did</I> forget! The oh-so-perfect Aerith Gainsborough forgot
something.”</P><P>Tifa
made an exaggerated gesture and started giggling at Aerith's blushing
face.</P><P>“You're
terrible. If I were to act like that every time you forgot something,
I'd long have died from suffocation!”</P><P>“Whoa,
that's really mean!”</P><P>They
continued to tease each other for a while, resulting in both of them
lying down on their big bed, gasping for air from laughing and
exhaustion.</P><P>“Say,
Tifa…how long should we stay like this?”</P><P>“A
few more minutes, at least. I can barely talk.”</P><P>“Not
that…”</P><P>Aerith
had noticed it earlier, when Tifa called her by her full name. They
were living together, lovers, and with Kairi they were a family. But
only for their close friends. In name, they were completely different
people, not related to each other.</P><P>“What
do you mean, Aerith?”</P><P>But
was now really the right time for that? They had just gotten Kairi
back and had had an argument too. Maybe waiting a bit more was better
after all.</P><P>“I'll
tell you later. Maybe.”</P><P>“Teasing
me again?!” Tifa got up and looked over at Aerith.</P><P>“Maybe.”</P><P>“You're
the devil woman, Aerith!”</P><P>“But
you still love me, don't you?”</P><P>“Point
taken.”</P><P>“We
should go to sleep, it's already past midnight.”</P><P>“I
feel like you're escaping from this, but you're right.”</P><P>One
day…one day, Aerith wanted to tell, wanted to ask Tifa for <I>that</I>.</P><p 
align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>They
were all there. Leon leaning on the wall, arms crossed. Cid in front
of his computer, ready to log their report. Yuffie sitting on an old
box, swinging her legs back and forth. Kairi, Olette and Naminè
sitting on chairs next to a table, still sleepy and not fully
recovered from their trip. Aerith was sitting just an arm's length
away from Kairi, and Tifa was standing behind Aerith.</P><P>Their
report had taken over three hours, and Leon had given them no break.
They were done, but he was now asking about details.</P><P>“First,
this man you three were fighting. You said you beat him on the ice
shelf she created.” Leon pointed at Naminè.</P><P>“Naminè.
Her name is Naminè. Stop being a prick, Leon,” Tifa snarled at
him.</P><P>“And
then you fought him again in the town, and shortly later on the path
between worlds.”</P><P>The
girls gave a simultaneous nod, and Leon laid a hand on his forehead.</P><P>“It
doesn't add up. First you win, then later, he seems to have powered
up and you have barely a chance, and just minutes later, he is
insanely powerful and you are defeated overwhelmingly. Such things
only exist in Cid's video games.”</P><P>The
smoker complained and cursed Leon for looking down on his games.</P><P>“Are
you sure you fought the same guy three times? Maybe you mistook him
for the same guy, but he was someone else. It doesn't make much sense
otherwise,” Leon questioned Kairi.</P><P>“I
don't think there are many guys like that. Using cards as battle
tools and all the piercings? No, that was the same guy, I'm
absolutely sure,” Kairi replied.</P><P>“Cid,
do you have any data on such a guy from our raid on their
headquarters?” Leon was skeptical. It made no sense. Did the guy
use some trick? Extreme healing magic? But even Aerith wouldn't be
able to heal damage like a cut-off hand in just a few minutes.</P><P>“Nope,
nothing, not a hint.”</P><P>“Leon,
I have a theory about his abilities.” It was rare for Yuffie to
speak up while others reported.</P><P>“If
you're fooling around, I'm going to be mad.”</P><P>“I
specialize in tricks and tools. I think this guy does too. Remember
that Kairi mentioned he first used cards while shouting their names?
What if each card stands for a different ability, just like how I use
many different tools?” Yuffie made a few gestures, to accompany her
explanation.</P><P>“Don't
be ridiculous. If that were the case, why would he limit his battle
tactics to just the same things every time?” Leon rolled his eyes,
slightly annoyed at Yuffie.</P><P>“Now
who is fooling around? Do you think I would use something new if I
knew the old things worked on my enemy? No offense, Kairi, but if he
was able to beat you with whatever he was using, there was no need to
let the enemy know what else he was capable of.”</P><P>“You're
reading way too much into this, Yuffie. From what they reported, he
was more than just sure he would win. There is no need to keep your
abilities a secret if you're going to kill everyone that knows about
them anyway.”</P><P>“It's
just my theory, but don't come back later complaining to me about it
when he kicks your butt,” Yuffie said, and waved her hand at Leon.</P><P>Tifa
was snorting over Yuffie's comment and earned an evil glare from Leon
in response, and another from Aerith, shutting her up.</P><P>“We
will find out when he makes his next move. No use in worrying about
this now.” Cid knew that Leon still had some questions, and it
really was meaningless to discuss the matter of the enemy and his
unknown abilities any further.</P><P>Leon
sighed and held his left hand to his forehead. “Okay, next. That
ice shelf. Aerith, I will need your opinion on that, but be serious.
I've never heard of you doing something crazy like that. Naminè, you
first. How did you do it?”</P><P>“I…don't
remember much. We were in danger and I saw this one recitation to
call upon power of Celsius in one of Aerith's books. I didn't think
it would go out of control like that.”</P><P>“Not
really much…Aerith, what kind of recitation spell was that?” Leon
was obviously unsatisfied.</P><P>“I
try to keep it simple. For recitation, there are different beings to
call upon. For ice, there are not as many as others. The only ones on
the god grade I know are Shiva, Jormungard, Fenrir, and Celsius.
Shiva is the weakest, the Queen of Ice. Jormungard is a forgotten
entity, and has no power left. I also never tried to recite from him
because back then, he was known to be unpredictable. Fenrir is, for
me, the highest form of ice recitation magic I can manage. Even then,
it takes a while to set up the spell. But Celsius…Celsius is the
Empress of Eternal Freezing, way beyond Fenrir. There are several
beings like her in the recitation chain of beings…”</P><P>Tifa
was covering her face in her hands, trying to prevent herself from
laughing. When Aerith was asked about magic, she went on and on, and
if you got lucky, she finished before the blood started running out
of your ears.</P><P>“…and
that means, god grade beings are generally unpredictable. Commonly,
we use king or knight grade beings for recitation. Even I have
problems with some of the stronger beings in that grade. But to call
upon the most powerful being…Naminè was extremely lucky that her
magical potential is not as big as mine. If I were to do something so
reckless and lost control of it, the entire world would end up
frozen. Basically, using any recitation beyond the lowest being on
the god grade will inevitably result in a loss of control.”</P><P>Leon
was already rolling his eyes along with everyone else. But Aerith
wouldn't shut up until she finished her recital.</P><P>“I
never met anyone who could control such spells. Not even Merlin or
King Mickey could. I think master Yen Sid would be able to, he is an
excellent magus. I believe he was able to master a recitation on
Adamant. Adamant is a god class being from the life circle and—”</P><P>Tifa
put a hand on Aerith's mouth, forcing her to be quiet. “I think
they understand. In short, it's more than just dangerous to use those
recitations. Don't use them, no matter what happens, Naminè. Or else
we'll all be forced to hear the full story on this.”</P><P>That
was actually a very scary thought and everyone present except Tifa
took a step back.</P><P>“I
wasn't finished,” Aerith complained.</P><P>“Now
you are,” Tifa said, and for once, roles were reversed and Tifa
gave her partner an angry glare.</P><P>“Don't
worry, Tifa, I'll tell you alone the whole thing later,” Aerith
said with a killing smile.</P><P>“That's
that. I expect you to be more cautious from now on. No dangerous
spells. Both of you.” Leon pointed at Naminè and Aerith, and both
of them started to sulk. It was special to be able to do recitation
magic, so how could Leon understand how hard it was to control it?</P><P>“There
was something else that disturbed me. That guy, Jack Sparrow. Did he
find out that you were from another world?” Leon looked straight at
Kairi.</P><P>“I
don't think so. He seemed smart, for a pirate, but I don't think he
understood who we were. He didn't ask any questions, so I guess he
knew I wasn't going to tell him anything,” Kairi replied to the
question.</P><P>That
was a relief. If people came to understand that there were other
worlds, order would break down, panic and disbelief would reign. They
had to avoid that at all costs. Keyblades seemed to have some kind of
illusion effect on their masters, preventing people on different
worlds from finding out about them. However, there was no way to
disguise the others. If they came along, it was obvious to people on
their worlds that they didn't belong there. That was the reason
people beside the Keybladers were usually forbidden to enter other
worlds. There were exceptions, like the raid on the headquarters of
the Nobodies.</P><P>“Good.
Try to avoid dragging civilians into our battles in the future. None
of us want to repeat past mistakes…”</P><P>Kairi
remembered that incident. She didn't want to, though. It had been not
entirely her fault, but she was the Keyblader, in the end, the guilt
came to haunt her.</P><P>“You
three will be grounded in Hollow Bastion for some time. Yuffie will
be going on recon missions. Once we spot the Organization, and deem
it safe, we will send you three out. If anything happens, you will
immediately come back, and there are no exceptions to this order.
That is all.”</P><P>Tifa
was feeling much better. She had been thinking a lot about how to
tell Kairi that she wasn't allowed to leave Hollow Bastion for some
time, and Aerith said that it was Tifa's job to tell her. She would
do the talking later, since she was better at it. Tifa was a bit
offended, but couldn't argue on that. Now that Leon had them
grounded, she was satisfied. Looking at Aerith, she could see that
the brunette was too. Aerith would never admit it, but she was more
than happy that Tifa had insisted on the fact that they had to punish
the girls somehow and grounding them wasn't too extreme but still a
punishment.</P><P>It
was finally over. Starting at eleven in the morning, it was now past
two. They were tired, hungry and exhausted, especially Kairi, Naminè
and Olette.</P><P>“Let's
go back. Let's go <I>home</I>,”
Aerith said, rubbing her temple.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Kairi
was in her room, sleeping. Olette was sitting on the table in the
living room, lethargically eating some snacks, Naminè was lying on
the couch, reading a book that Aerith had given her: <I>Ezatin Mios –
Beings Beyond the World.</I></P><P>Tifa
was out shopping for dinner, and Aerith was doing the laundry. None
of them was eager to talk about what had happened yet again. Tifa and
Aerith had heard everything in their report. Kairi was still not
fully recovered, Naminè's headache had gone worse, and Olette was
just tired. Olette had done most of the talking when they had had to
report about the time they had spent in the unfriendly town.</P><P>“Olette,
could you help me with the laundry? There is another basket on the
stairs, could you get it for me?”</P><P>Aerith
was standing behind her with a basket full of freshly washed clothes.
Since Naminè and Olette had only a few sets of clothes, they had to
wash them often. Tifa and Aerith had spent a little fortune on new
clothes for the girls, since neither of them had more than what they
wore when they first arrived.</P><P>Their
taste was fairly simple, though. Naminè preferred a simple dress,
such as the one she wore when she first met Kairi. She had two in
white, and a black one. Olette kept her old clothes and got some
others. Long jeans, and several tops, close in looks to what she
usually wore.</P><P>“Sure.
Oh, and…I'm sorry for running away with Kairi like that.”</P><P>“You
should be. But enough of that. I'm happy that all three of you are
back.”</P><P>Olette
didn't know what to say. Ever since she had learned that her home,
Twilight Town, was a fabricated world, she kind of doubted
everything. But for once, she felt a little bit at home.</P><P>They
used the balcony to dry the clothes, and Olette was in charge of
hanging the wet clothes from the second basket. She had a hard time,
mostly because half of that basket contained various pairs of
underwear from about anyone living in the house.</P><P>“Wow…I
didn't know something like this counts as underwear.” Olette was
holding a black thong.</P><P>“That's
Kairi's,” Aerith said, absolutely casual.</P><P>It
took Olette a second to comprehend that she was holding Kairi's
underwear in her hands. She went from astonished to glaring red in a
split second. “W-w-what?!”</P><P>“I'm
just kidding,” Aerith said with a huge grin. “It's Naminè's.”</P><P>“That's
not any better!” Olette complained, and put the thong away.</P><P>“You're
so easy to tease, I just couldn't resist. Just like Tifa.” Aerith
smiled, much to Olette's delight.</P><P>“Actually,
you comparing me with Tifa is a bit scary,” Olette said, thinking
about the relationship the two women had.</P><P>“I
think you know I didn't mean it like that.”</P><P>Olette
just nodded and they silently finished doing the laundry. They both
were sitting on the table when Aerith started a conversation.</P><P>“So,
you have a thing for Kairi?” Again the casual tone.</P><P>Olette
almost spat out the juice she was drinking and started coughing. Just
where and from whom…?!</P><P>“What
gives you that idea?” Olette sort of panicked. This must be the
feeling one got when left alone with the parent of the boy or girl
one had a crush on.</P><P>“Hm…let's
see. For one, your reaction earlier at the thong. I could have sold
you off as big tomato. Then, you almost spat your juice out at my
question now. And then…well, let's just say it's womanly
intuition.”</P><P>Olette
went red like a light bulb at Christmas. She had to defend herself
somehow. It was not like that!</P><P>“Everyone
would spit at such a sudden question! And I think everyone would show
some reaction if you told them who that underwear belongs to!”</P><P>“So
you don't like her?” Aerith was looking with her sparkling eyes at
Olette.</P><P>She
found happiness with Tifa, so if anyone had to be together with
Kairi, Aerith would like it to be a girl. It seemed really
unrealistic, though, that Kairi would come to like anyone in a
romantic way.</P><P>“You
won't talk to her about it, right?” Olette made a serious face,
looking straight back at Aerith.</P><P>“I
won't if you don't want me to.” Aerith was serious too. If Olette
really looked at Kairi like that, then she would not tell Kairi.
Olette had said nothing about not telling Tifa, though, and Aerith
smiled a bit on the inside.</P><P>“I

<I>do</I> like her. But it's complicated.” Olette was a bit
embarrassed to tell Aerith.</P><P>“What's
so complicated about it?”</P><P>“Naminè
and I are very close. We both like Kairi, and we both told Kairi that
we like her, and we told each other that we like Kairi.”</P><P>Aerith
was slightly confused for a moment but then caught on. Olette
continued to talk, and it was obvious that she really wanted to talk
to someone outside of their little love triangle.</P><P>“Naminè
and I know that Kairi can only go out with one of us. That is…if
she likes one of us back.”</P><P>Aerith
smiled and laid her hand on Olette's. “I don't think she has a
crush on anyone. So you two just need to work hard for her to like
you.”</P><P>“I
don't really want to go out with her if that means hurting Naminè. I
think she feels the same.”</P><P>It
was quite obvious in what direction the conversation was going.</P><P>“I
see the problem. You don't want Naminè to get her heart broken, and
vice versa…”</P><P>“I
think…I only wanted her to know how I feel. How Naminè feels about
Kairi is obvious. I think…I only want to know how Kairi feels. In
the end, even if she were to say yes to me…I would turn her down.
If being together with her will make Naminè feel all alone, I really
don't want that.”</P><P>“You
really <I>do</I> like Naminè, don't you? Why don't you two try and
go out with each other?”</P><P>Olette
blushed a bit at the thought, but immediately shook her head. It
wasn't like that between them.</P><P>“Kairi
and Naminè are different. We're close friends, we can't go out.”</P><P>Aerith
giggled and got up. She had known that Naminè was in love with
Kairi, but that Olette was too had been sort of a surprise. It was
kind of sad, though, that most likely none of the girls would have
their dream fulfilled. In the end, it would be really odd for Kairi
to develop lesbian interests.</P><P>“I
hope everything works out in the end.” Aerith didn't know what else
to say. If it made Kairi happy, Aerith would be happy to do whatever
she could to support them.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Two
days of doing nothing but eating, sleeping, and recovering had gone
by since they reported. They were mostly back on track, thanks to
Aerith's strong healing magic. Aerith had kept quiet, even to Tifa,
about Olette and Kairi, and the girls didn't talk much. Naminè tried
to give Kairi some space, and Olette avoided Kairi, afraid of the
answer to her question. Kairi herself often slept till noon or past
that and then only got up to eat and went back to bed. Her mind was
occupied with several things at all times.</P><P>Why
did Olette have to fall in love with her too? Naminè had been so
intrusive before, but thank God she kept a distance now. It made
Kairi's life much easier. Whatever happened between Naminè and
Olette, it seemed like the brunette had a positive effect on the
blond girl.</P><P>But
she had to postpone her thoughts on that. She had to get well fast to
resume training. Kairi wanted to become stronger than anyone else.
Strong enough to never lose a battle again. Both Olette and Naminè
had resumed their training this day, but Kairi needed Aerith's
approval to resume training.</P><P>Olette
had gotten well enough to resume training with Tifa, but it was
completely different from before. Sure, they still did physical
training, and Olette had gotten really proficient in using two
Keyblades, and learned a few different moves from Tifa that involved
fighting barehanded.</P><P>“Physical
strength is important, but if you lack skill, you lose a lot of
potential. Since we can't cut down on physical strength training,
we'll be changing the program. You're doing three hours of physical
training each day. Mondays and Thursdays, you're going to do speed
training. I mean speed like slashing away as fast as you can. You
will do that until you reach a NAM of over ninety-five.”</P><P>“What
does ANM mean? And somehow, ninety-five sounds like a lot…”
Olette didn't even start complaining about three hours of working out
each day. It was useless to complain once Tifa had set her mind on
something.</P><P>“Number
of Attacks per Minute. Means you've got to hit any target over
ninety-five times a minute.”</P><P>Olette
looked like someone just dropped a building on her. Tifa couldn't be
serious! That was totally crazy to demand.</P><P>“Can
you even do that?” Olette was demanding a demonstration.</P><P>“My
NAM is one-hundred-and-fifteen. Watch.” Giving Olette a stop watch,
she put on her gloves.</P><P>Tifa
turned around and focused on a sandbag that was fixated on the wall.
It was heavy and made of leather, reinforced with thin iron thread.
Olette could hit that thing as hard as she wanted and it wouldn't
budge.</P><P>“Go!”
Olette called, and could barely trust her eyes.</P><P>Tifa
was like a different person. Ice cold eyes, never letting the enemy
escape her gaze, insanely fast yet powerful hits on the sandbag. It
didn't bounce, it was a stationary target, but it let out dust from
the impact on it. Olette could barely believe it. It was hard to
count the number of hits, but she was sure that Tifa had surpassed
one-hundred by the time the watch stopped.</P><P>“That's
amazing…seriously.” Olette clapped with wide eyes.</P><P>“When
I'm under the influence of time magic from Aerith, I manage over
two-hundred. It's dangerous, though. I'm relatively safe, because I
fight bare-handed, but if you were to go beyond one-hundred, you
could injure yourself. It'll take years for you to reach ninety-five,
though, so don't worry.”</P><P>Years?
Just how long did Tifa plan to train her? For all her life? Some
people really were too enthusiastic about their job. It wasn't even a
job, so why was Tifa agog on training her?</P><P>“We'll
start today with physical training. Since you only got out of bed, I
want you to run the old course three times before we start working on
your muscles.”</P><P>The
old course was through the living quarters, past that through the
castle, taking the lift to the bottom of the canyon, from there
running up all the way to the industrial quarter, and from there back
to the living quarters. Roughly three miles. Olette had to jog or run
the track, and the only break she would get was when she took the
lift.</P><P>“Ow,
go easy on me, Tifa. I won't run away, you'll have plenty of chance
to torture—er, I mean,
train me.”</P><P>Tifa's
eye twitched in a scary manner. Olette took this as a sign that she
better get going.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“I
heard how good you've gotten with recitation magic, so I'll start
teaching you more instantaneous magic to balance your abilities.
Relying too much on recitation magic will prove ineffective against a
fast enemy. We'll start by the next grade of Fire, Ice and Cure
magic. I'll teach you a few new magics when you get proficient at
using the old ones at grade two.”</P><P>Aerith
walked over to Naminè and stopped behind her, laying both hands on
Naminè's shoulders and taking a deep breath.</P><P>“Now,
picture fire magic and try to pour a bit more magical energy in it.
Then picture a big fireball, and unleash your power. It's a simple
matter of getting used to the new image. It'll take you some time to
get used to it.”</P><P>Naminè
was shocked at the amount Aerith talked about magic. Tifa had talked
to her a bit before Naminè went to training near the canyon, giving
her a brief warning that Aerith was a real maniac when it came to
magic. She could talk for hours without break.</P><P>Aerith
took a few steps forward and focused on a formation of rocks nearby.
Index and middle finger sprawled out, the others in her palm, Aerith
concentrated for just a split-second and sent a fireball on the
formation. It exploded with an impressive bang.</P><P>“That's
what a fire two spell looks like. It's very useful for close combat,
since the explosion isn't that strong but the fire is several
thousand degrees hot. A point-blank hit would be fatal for about
anyone. But it is mostly used to divert the enemy's attention, and
you can use that spell very often in succession.”</P><P>Naminè
was half-numb from all the talk. There was a limit to how much
information she could take in at once. For now, she tried to burn the
image of the fireball into her mind.</P><P>“Try
it. It shouldn't be too hard.”</P><P>It
was weird not to use a recitation, but instant magic was, at higher
grades, almost as powerful as recitation magic, but without the need
to recite anything.</P><P>Magic
energy gave shape to what otherwise only existed in the mind of the
caster. If the caster pictured a fireball, magic energy could give
shape and existence to it.</P><P>The
stronger the magic, the bigger the ball had to be, and the stronger
the pictured effect had to be. While for the very basic spell, a
torch was enough to ignite it, a bigger ball required a much bigger
fire. It was extremely important to find the right balance between
magic power and the picturing effect. If the effect was too strong,
the magic would be crushed in the caster's mind. Too weak, and the
magic would stay raw and eventually break free, resulting in a spell
running amok.</P><P>Naminè
started with a flame the size of a campfire. The ball was over twice
the size of the previous spell, but it was just her first try.</P><P>She
failed instantaneously. The flame devoured the entire ball, eating up
the magic.</P><P>It
was normal to fail the first few tries. Some magicians took months
and years to learn the correct balance for the highest grade instant
spells. The problem didn't occur with recitation magic as the power
was not formed inside the magician but just called into him. It was a
matter of creating the magic itself or just calling it down.</P><P>“Try
it again. I usually go with fivefold the size of the basic spell for
the next step.”</P><P>“Fivefold?
But…” Naminè coughed for a moment. It was rather chilly down at
the canyon.</P><P>“You
don't need to rush. Magic takes a while to get used to, but once you
get a grip on how to use a spell, you don't need to practice it
often.” Aerith smiled, patted Naminè's head and went back to her
position.</P><P>The
ball. Five times the usual size. That alone was hard. It was like
lifting a car when you're only used to lifting hundred-pound weights.
It didn't mean the pressure was just five times the usual amount. It
was much higher.</P><P>Using
the flame of an abnormally big bonfire, the ball caught fire and grew
in size. Things were looking good. It grew and the magic finally
materialized at the end of Monochrome's blade. It was a nice blaze
and the ball was in a stable form. It must've been a few thousand
degrees hot. Air was flickering around it. It was a success.</P><P>But
it wasn't to be.</P><P>The
ball collapsed back upon itself. Losing all structure and the magic
rapidly vanishing, the spell failed. Only almost a success.</P><P>Naminè
was breathing hard. It took a lot to try new spells, and Naminè was
still not completely sound and well.</P><P>“You
almost had it. Take a break, I know how stressful new spells are.”
Aerith was honestly amazed at her apprentice.</P><P>“Thanks,
Aerith. You're a really good teacher. You talk a lot but it actually
helps.” Naminè had failed the spell twice, but once she had gotten
really close.</P><P>Aerith
didn't know if she should be embarrassed or thankful, so she didn't
say anything. They had taken some canned juice with them. Aerith
picked up two cans and walked over to where Naminè was sitting.
Closed eyes, her back on a big rock, a bit tired.</P><P>What
were Kairi and Olette doing right now? Kairi wasn't allowed to get
up, so she was probably all alone in the house. Naminè was feeling
pity for her, but tried to shake that feeling off. Kairi wouldn't
want to be pitied. Olette was probably being worked to the bone by
Tifa.</P><P>Tifa
preferred to drink beer after training, but Aerith didn't like the
bitter taste of it. And Naminè was still underage. Aerith could bet
that she was trying to get Olette to drink it. She would behead Tifa
if Olette turned out to be like her. One troublemaker adult in the
house was enough, not to mention that Olette could have a negative
influence on Naminè if that happened.</P><P>Naminè
looked up, startled, when Aerith held a very cold can on her cheek.
She had used a weak ice spell to cool them down. They had been
standing in the sun for over an hour.</P><P>“Thanks…Aerith,
you're looking really scary…” Naminè was more afraid of Aerith's
face than of the remaining training.</P><P>“Oh,
really? I was just thinking that Tifa better not make Olette do
something <I>improper</I>.”</P><P>“Uh…
right…”</P><P>Naminè
could feel it. It would be Tifa's last day if Olette came home and
something was odd. She made a mental note to never listen to any of
Tifa's propositions. She would tell Olette later.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“She
is trying to kill me…seriously, I'm telling you!”</P><P>Olette
was laying facedown on her bed, soaked, and so tired that she was
unable to move. Olette had thought that a real battle was bad,and
injuries were hard to endure, but this felt much worse. Tifa had
worked her literally to the bone. Olette had passed out in training
and Tifa had brought her home. Naminè had been there for just a bit
over ten minutes, so she was rather worried.</P><P>“I
don't think she wants to kill you.” Naminè was not sure if Olette
was being serious.</P><P>“Nah,
if it's Tifa, she really would do it. Not intentionally, though. She
just knows no limits.” Yuffie had come over to visit the girls
because she was bored. And hungry.</P><P>“I'd
rather have you train me, Yuffie.” Olette sighed.</P><P>“Won't
do. You're more the brute type. Two Keyblades 'n stuff. I work with
tools and tricks, none of you girls has the wits and speed for that.”</P><P>“Well,
thank you for the compliment.” Olette grumbled and turned over. A
hot shower, dinner, and bed. Those were the only things important
right now.</P><P>“If
you invite me for a date, I'll think about it.”</P><P>“A
date?” Naminè was looking a bit confusedly at Yuffie.</P><P>“Yeah.
Going for dinner, watching a movie, a bit of kissing and ending up
waking up together.”</P><P>Olette
was blushing red. Was Yuffie being serious? A date? And all that
stuff she said…</P><P>Olette
was struggling for an answer but nothing came out. It got even worse
when Yuffie went up and walked over to Olette's bed, getting as close
as making the brunette feel her breath on her face.</P><P>“Don't
you like me?” Yuffie was trying to sound as seductive as possible.</P><P>If
something like that happened, Olette would've let out steam of her
ears and nose. Her body wouldn't listen to her and moved away. She
was like a rabbit caught in Yuffie's trap.</P><P>To
top it all off, Yuffie was getting closer, as if to kiss Olette. A
strange mix of panic and excitement was coming up in Olette. Yuffie
was not much older than she. Maybe a year or two. And even though she
was kind of a tomboy, she was cute. Olette couldn't believe she was
thinking stuff like that.</P><P>Afraid
and excited, Olette closed her eyes, waiting for the kiss. If she
couldn't prevent it, she would at least take it like a woman.</P><P>But
nothing came. On the contrary, someone pulled her cheeks. It hurt a
bit. And someone started laughing. Laughing really hard. Opening her
eyes, Olette was looking in Yuffie's face, who was almost drooling
from laughter.</P><P>“You're

<I>such</I> a child! You were <I>so</I> thinking I was going to kiss
you, weren't ya!”</P><P>That
was so mean, Olette could only look embarrassed. Naminè was laughing
too. And she had had such a hard day too! She would pay Yuffie back,
for sure!</P><P>“If
I really had to pick, I'd rather go with cute Naminè here on a
date.” Yuffie let go of Olette and looked straight at the blond
girl.</P><P>Yuffie
had changed her target. Now it was Naminè's turn.</P><P>“Yuffie,
I think that is quite enough.”</P><P>Aerith
had entered the room, holding a few folded towels, and was looking at
Yuffie with a certain glare.</P><P>“Jealous,
Aerith? Could it be that <I>you</I> want to go on a date with me?”
Yuffie was still playing around.</P><P>“Do
you want me to ask Tifa if she wants to go?” Aerith could play her
game. And she was good at it.</P><P>“Uh,
no. I remember last time…oh, I wasn't supposed to tell you.”</P><P>“Must
be hard. I mean, just the <I>size</I> is <I>so</I> different.”
Aerith could be a real devil.</P><P>That
hurt. Yuffie had a few self-esteem problems and had a complex about
her little bust. How dare Aerith make fun of her!</P><P>“It's
not my fault that Tifa is such a boob monster!” Yuffie had damned
herself; Aerith now knew where her weak points were.</P><P>“So
Naminè and Olette are monsters too? They're both bigger than you.”</P><P>The girls
blushed slightly, and Naminè pulled on her dress, looking down at
her body. Olette could only figure that Aerith had been together with
Tifa quite some time to be able to tell something like that. It was a
bit embarrassing anyway.</P><P>“You
must have marbles for eyes! Look!” Yuffie thought that she had the
best chance by picking Naminè.</P><P>Yuffie
pulled up Naminè and stood next to her. Aerith first looked
interested, then gave away a devilish grin. Looking Naminè (who was
more than just slightly embarrassed by that) and Yuffie (who was
nothing short of angry) up and down, she came to a conclusion.</P><P>“Naminè
wins. Sorry, but flat is flat, Yuffie. Maybe we should call you
Princess Boobless.” That hurt. Aerith had won.</P><P>Yuffie
made an angry fizzling sound and made her way out of the room without
saying another word, stomping and sizzling over the humiliation.</P><P>“I'll
get you back for this!”</P><P>Then
there was stomping down the stairs, and a door was banged closed. The
whole house was silent for a second, until Tifa showed up in the
doorframe.</P><P>“Did
you make Yuffie mad again, Aerith? Jeez, every time the same. You
really shouldn't be so mean to her.” Tifa was actually smiling more
with every word.</P><P>“Don't
lie. I know you love it when I tease Yuffie. I'm the only one that
gives her a beating in her own game too,” Aerith replied. She was
also smiling.</P><P>Olette
just didn't know what to think of this crazy town and its people
anymore. They were way weird. She missed her daily Struggles and
face-offs with Hayner and Pence. Even their fights with Seifer's
gang, Rai's annoying loud attitude, Fuu's less-is-more behavior. They
were all…not real. Was that really true? Olette didn't know much
about Cid, but he didn't seem like a person who would make such an
elemental error.</P><P>But there
had to be some way to get back…get back…home. It was her home,
virtual or real. That made no difference. One day, she would go back,
find a way, meet her friends, for sure!</P><P>Naminè
had gone back to reading a light novel she had borrowed from Aerith.
A story about an evil association trying to exploit the resources of
the planet, gradually killing it, and a resistance group, called
terrorists who were trying to save the planet. Naminè thought that a
few of those people looked a lot like the people from Hollow Bastion.</P><P>How long
would she have to wait before going to approach Kairi? Did she even
want to anymore? On that alien world, in the time she had spent with
Olette, there was one thing she had learned about herself, her
feelings. One side of her wanted to be with Kairi, but the other
cared about Olette just as much. That inner conflict left her without
answer to the questions in her head. What did she want to do?</P><P>“Dinner
will be ready in an hour. Olette, please take a shower before that.
Tifa, you too. You two smell like dogs who've been playing in the
dirt.” Aerith was merciless when it came to cleanliness. No shower
meant no dinner.</P><P>“I'll
go first, Olette. I'll massage you later, otherwise you'll drop dead
by tomorrow evening. Aerith here would kill me.”</P><P>“Oh,
don't be silly Tifa, I would <I>never</I> do that.” It was crystal
clear what Aerith really meant.</P><P>The
outlook of being massaged was nice. To have it done by Tifa was quite
the contrary. Olette was fearing for the worst. If Tifa's massage was
as rough as her training, then that was going to be her end.</P><P>The two
women left, leaving the door open and the two girls alone. They
hadn't seen Kairi for the whole day. Well, until now.</P><P>“You
two look exhausted.”</P><P>Even if
they both had feelings for her, that was no reason to avoid 
them.</P><P>“Kairi!”</P><P>Olette
somehow managed to sit upright but going down the ladder was a bit
too much. Hugging her would give the wrong impression too, Olette
thought. Naminè wasn't as thoughtful and jumped and hugged Kairi. It
didn't seem to annoy Olette or Kairi, but she still let go after a
few seconds.</P><P>“I'm
sure Tifa is working you to the bone, Olette.”</P><P>“She's
trying to kill me, honestly.”</P><P>“I
believe you. Actually…yes, I really do. I can so imagine Tifa doing
that. But I believe you can live up to her expectations. If anyone
can, then you.”</P><P>Olette
blushed a bit and scratched her chin. It wasn't like Kairi to praise
her. It was clear that she wanted to motivate her, but Olette was
happy that Kairi did it at all.</P><P>“And
I'm sure you're living up to Aerith's expectations already, right
Naminè?”</P><P>“Yeah.
I'm trying my very best!”</P><P>Naminè
blushed and jumped happily on the spot. It was like someone had given
her an expensive sweet. Being praised by Kairi was special for
Naminè. They'd both been praised, no less, and the apprentice
magician looked up to her partner, who was smiling from heart at her.</P><P>Kairi
could see how hard they were training. It made her feel guilty for
laying around all day. Tomorrow, she finally could go back to her
daily routine. Kairi would train so hard that she would beat that
Organization guy the next time they met for sure.</P><P>“Want
to go to that place tomorrow, you two? I think I'll be free to go out
from tomorrow on. Aerith would put me into a cage if I were to go
anywhere tonight.”</P><P>“If I'm
alive,” Olette replied, but she would go, even if Tifa actually
broke her.</P><P>“I'll
go for sure,” Naminè said, and looked up to Olette. “I'll heal
you if you can't move.”</P><P>Kairi was
surprised how well they got along. It was nice to see them like that.
It let Kairi feel at ease.</P><P>“You
two really get along now, hm…” Kairi was a bit curious about what
had happened between them. She had already noticed when they had
their own little reunion on the path between the worlds.</P><P>“We do.
A lot of stuff happened. I understand now how Naminè feels.”</P><P>“And
I'm not the spoiled child I was when I first got here. I'm…a bit
sorry about my behavior back then.” Naminè was a bit embarrassed,
thinking back.</P><P>“I
heard most of what happened when you reported. But you didn't tell
Leon what happened that made you get along this well.” Kairi was
drilling for an answer.</P><P>“That's
a secret.” Naminè giggled and held a finger upright in front of
her mouth.</P><P>“Yep, a
secret it is,” Olette approved, and had a big smile on her face.</P><P>Kairi
would never get out of them what exactly happened. Maybe it was
better like that. Sometimes, less was more. And if they got along
like this, it was enough for Kairi. It made her sort of happy.</P><P>Out of a
lack of possible topics they could talk about, Kairi just chose
something casual.</P><P>“Tonight's
dinner is gonna be fried potatoes. I can't wait.” Kairi was sitting
together with Naminè on her bed. Olette had gone back to lying down
on her bed. She was too tired to sit, even when Kairi was there.</P><P>“I hope
I'll be able to eat anything at all. I feel like moving my arms will
need a miracle.”</P><P>“I'll
feed you,” Kairi was smiling and teasing her.</P><P>“That's
unfair, I want to be fed too!” Naminè demanded, looking at Kairi.</P><P>“You'd
want to be fed by her anyway,” Olette teased her.</P><P>“So
what? You too, Olette!”</P><P>“What
are you two, nine years old?” Kairi tried to end their mutual
teasing.</P><P>“Would
you feed us if we were nine years old?” Olette was now teasing the
redhead.</P><P>“Nope.
You two are old enough to eat for yourselves.”</P><P>“Whoa,
that's mean. You said you'd feed me, right, Naminè?”</P><P>“You
did, Kairi. Are you going back on your word?”</P><P>Kairi
stood up, sticking her tongue out at Naminè.</P><P>“You
two…are teaming up against me, aren't you!” Kairi was now playing
the hurt and fragile girl. But they didn't buy it. Her acting was
catastrophic.</P><P>“Yeah.
We're best friends now. You can't escape,” Olette replied,
completely casual.</P><P>“Olette
is right. You're all ours, Kairi.” Naminè made a devilish smile,
something she had copied from Aerith.</P><P>“Who
are you two and what did you do with Olette and Naminè?!” Kairi
was having fun. It was the first time in a very long time that she
had fooled around with girls her age like this.</P><P>“We
could ask you the same,” the two girls replied, laughing.</P><P>“You
seem to be having fun.”</P><P>Tifa
stood in the doorframe, wearing only a long towel and laughing.</P><P>“How
long have you been eavesdropping, you evil spirit?!” Kairi was
embarrassed to be seen by Tifa while fooling around with the other
two.</P><P>“Long
enough to know who'll feed whom at tonight's dinner.” Tifa had such
a big grin on her face, Kairi got more embarrassed by the second.</P><P>“I'm
not gonna feed anyone!” Kairi was objecting.</P><P>“Oh,
we'll see about that.” Tifa laughed again and walked past Kairi,
not without petting her head. “Olette, the bath is free. Go now,
while it's hot in there. You'll feel a lot better after a hot shower.
It relaxes the muscles.”</P><P>“If
every muscle that hurts is going to be relaxed, I'll end up as
pudding.”</P><P>Tifa was
rolling her eyes when she left and Olette got down. It was an
atrocious process. Every step hurt. And then, she had to look forward
to a massage by Tifa after dinner.</P><P>“See
you two at dinner. Keep your pants on.” Olette waved and hauled
herself over to the bathroom door.</P><P>“Olette!”
Naminè squeaked and started coughing for a second.</P><P>“Don't
worry, Naminè is wearing a dress. No pants.”</P><P>“Your
heart is pitch black, Kairi, did I tell you that?” Olette said, and
vanished into the bathroom.</P><P>“I'm
sorry, Naminè, but I think I'm going to leave you alone until
dinner.” Kairi was suddenly not feeling so good anymore. With both
of them around, it was okay, but now that she was alone with one of
them, she felt the pressure.</P><P>“Don't
worry, I have this book to read.” Naminè pointed at the cover of
the light novel that was lying on her pillow. She knew what was going
on, and understood Kairi's side too.</P><P>“<I>Shin-Ra</I>,
huh…” Kairi knew the story. And she knew who wrote it. It wasn't
just fiction.</P><P>“It's
really interesting. So…see you at dinner.” Naminè didn't like
it, but went to her bed and opened the book.</P><P>Three
weeks ago, Kairi would have said something like this was impossible.
Naminè understanding the situation and leaving her alone.</P><P>Things
really had changed.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“Aerith
told me about your little talk this afternoon.”</P><P>Olette
stopped breathing for a second. Had she misheard what Tifa said?
Or…Aerith! Olette finally noticed that she hadn't asked Aerith to
not tell Tifa about it. There was no telling what she would do to her
now! She was lying on the couch, half-nude, being massaged by Tifa.</P><P>“I
don't think Aerith would lie to me about it, and I take your silence
as confirmation that I'm right.” Tifa made a cracking sound with
her knuckles.</P><P>Olette
was more than just worried. Tifa didn't sound very happy about the
fact that she, Olette, had a crush on her precious foster daughter.
That cracking sound only made it worse.</P><P>Was
she in serious danger? Kind of helpless, Olette feared for a moment
that Tifa would threaten her and tell her to leave Kairi alone or
something. Or worse, start to harass her and put her through even
crazier training.</P><P>“I…what
are you talking about, Tifa? I'm not sure—”
Olette felt a sudden pain and stopped.</P><P>Tifa's
eyebrow twitched from anger and she had pushed a bit too hard on
Olette's left arm. It wasn't like her to try to stay calm and
rationally think things over. But out of all things, Aerith would
seriously never forgive her if she did something serious to one of
the girls.</P><P>“I'm
not going to do anything to you. I only want to talk.”</P><P>In
a sense, that was even more scary than an angry Tifa. Olette never
talked much with Tifa about personal things like that. Why was she
starting now? Because Aerith had told Tifa about her crush on Kairi?</P><P>“You
better be honest with me. I really hate it when people lie to me.”
Tifa did sound very serious.</P><P>Olette
nodded as far as that was possible in her situation and waited for
the first question. It felt like a ruthless judge was over her,
waiting for her to make a single mistake to find her guilty.</P><P>“You
like Kairi?”</P><P>That
was to be expected. Olette nodded but then decided to actually answer
her. “I do.”</P><P>It
was obvious from Tifa's tone that she wasn't pleased to hear that.
“How much?”</P><P>“I…love
her?” Olette was not sure if that was the right thing to say.</P><P>“Do
you or not?”</P><P>Was
it the indecisiveness in her statement that made Tifa angry? Or the
fact that she was in love with Kairi?</P><P>“I
do.” Tifa said she should be honest. There was no telling how much
Tifa knew, and Olette decided to be honest.</P><P>“That's
good, then.”</P><P>What
just happened? Tifa had made a sudden character change and didn't
sound so angry anymore. Olette actually relaxed for a second, until
Tifa leaned down and whispered something in her ear.</P><P>“You
better be serious about her.” It was accompanied by a gruesome
smile, Olette could see it from the corner of her eyes.</P><P>“What
do you think about Naminè?”</P><P>Olette
didn't know what to answer. What did she think about Naminè?
Thinking about it, if she had any romantic feelings for her, they
must be well-hidden.</P><P>“She's
a friend…but I love her. Not in a romantic way, I'm sure about
that.”</P><P>That
was the closest thing to the truth she could say without dying of
embarrassment. It was already pretty painful to say. She must be as
red as a tomato.</P><P>“I
see. So, it's about that. You don't want to destroy the bond you
share with Naminè?” Tifa was actually pretty good at this. Maybe
the rough girl was just all a facade and she was actually pretty
sensitive about romantic stuff?</P><P>“I
don't get why you two are like that, though. Can't you stay friends,
even if the other goes out with Kairi?”</P><P>Or
not. This was definitely the Tifa she knew, irresponsible and rough.</P><P>“I
don't want to see Naminè hurt.”</P><P>Tifa
only listened, seemingly thinking.</P><P>“I
know I'm asking for the impossible.” Olette sighed.</P><P>Tifa
had finally finished her massage and knelt on the ground, looking
straight in Olette's face. “Some resolution you have. Not even
trying, and already whining about it.”</P><P>It
was all she could say. Tifa wasn't really pleased that now even
Olette had developed a crush on Kairi, but Tifa knew that she
couldn't keep Kairi alone forever. It would be a cruel and evil thing
to do.</P><P>Slowly,
Tifa walked away to the stairs, fighting with the feelings of a
parent who wants to protect their child and the feelings of a friend
that wanted to see the other one happy.</P><P>“You
better be grateful to Aerith. If some guy were to come up and tell me
he had a crush on Kairi, I'd throw him out the window without a
second thought.”</P><P>Olette
was left behind, alone with nothing but her thoughts. A little bit of
desperation was in her voice…</P><P>“Just
what should I do…?”</P>
