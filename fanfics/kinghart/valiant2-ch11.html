<h2>a <a href="../kinghart/index.html">Kingdom Hearts</a>

<a href="../kinghart/valiant2-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><p align='center'><I>Gambling</I></P><P>“What
business has the Organization here?” Kairi yelled over at the man
with the black coat.</P><P>She
had to stall as long as possible.
Right now, they were in the worst situation possible, and
Kairi had no plan. Naminè was exhausted, and fighting on magically
created ice was just ridiculous.</P><P>“That
is none of your business, Keyblader.”</P><P>He
didn't seem very talkative. That wasn't good. This worked so very
well in theory, but in reality, the enemy didn't wait until one was
ready to fight.</P><P>“Who—”
Kairi was cut off before she could say anything further.</P><P>“I'm
not here to talk or drink tea. It is none of your business who I am,
what I am after, or what I am doing here.”</P><P>And
to stress those facts even more, he came at the girls with surprising
speed. He, however, didn't leave the ice, and that was enough for
Kairi to handle a emergency tactic.</P><P>“Olette,
in front of me. You're the best close up. I will back you up.”</P><P>The
ice bridge wasn't that wide, and there was only one enemy. They had
the advantage here.</P><P>Olette
did as instructed and passed Kairi in the instant the Organization
member had almost reached them. While running, Olette materialized
her second blade, the Hero's Crest, and launched a brutal frontal
attack at the enemy—</P><P>—only
find out immediately that this wouldn't be so easy. A giant card had
materialized out of thin air directly between Olette and the man.</P><P>“Ace
of Hearts, Absolute Protection,” a voice rang from behind the at
least eight-foot-tall card.</P><P>“Ace
of Spades, Impact!” was the next thing Olette heard before she was
sent flying.</P><P>Something
had tackled her and robbed her of breath. It was like Tifa had just
hit her with all her strength. To her luck, Kairi was watching the
scenario and caught Olette before she could hit the icy hard ground.</P><P>“Just
what in the hell was that?” Olette complained, barely able to
speak.</P><P>“His
cards. From the reports the other gave, each of the Organization
members has his own special style of fighting. This one seems to be
fighting with cards.”</P><P>Now
it was time to launch a counter-offensive. Kairi used a fast cure
spell on Olette and waited for a moment. Naminè would finish her
preparations for a wide-scale ice spell any second now. That would
clear the condition of the ground. Now, Kairi had to figure out how
to deal with this card maniac.</P><P>But
where was he? Neither Kairi nor Olette was able to spot him. Kairi
had lost focus of him when she saved Olette.</P><P>“Queen
of Diamonds, Illusion Door and King of Spades, Royal Tackle!”</P><P>The
man appeared out of thin air right between Kairi and Olette, and
before they could react, the next card was played and both of them
were thrown to the ground. It was like the effect of a tenfold
increase in gravity.</P><P>Both
of them could feel the impact on the ice. It hurt like crap, but it
would've been worse if the ground had been made of stone.
Magically-created ice was just about as solid and strong as natural
ice. If this attack had landed a successful hit on stone ground, it
would have been devastating.</P><P>Kairi
gave Olette a nod, and a split second later, the brunette was in
mid-air, both Keyblades roaring through the night, heading right at
the enemy.</P><P>“Jack
of Hearts, Mir—” he was cut off.</P><P>“No,
not this time!” Kairi yelled, kicking after his legs and managing
to throw him off balance. On the unstable ground, he couldn't get any
grip, and before he could finish playing his card, Olette was about
to slash him to pieces.</P><P>“Three
of six!” he shouted, and threw a few dice. Time seemed to stand
still. Olette was frozen in mid-air, the enemy falling, Kairi only
able to watch. Only the dice were rolling. One stopped. Six. The
second stopped. Six. The third was rolling on the ice. One.</P><P>Time
continued to work and the man got hit by a brutal frontal
double-slash from an angry brunette. He screamed out in pain and held
his left shoulder, which was bleeding heavily.</P><P>“Seven
of Diamonds, Teleport!”</P><P>And
he was gone from their eyes.</P><P>They
hadn't won, that Kairi won. Someone who could throw them around like
that wouldn't turn tail and run because of a single injury.</P><P>And
it was finally time for Naminè to show her power.</P><P>“<I>Lord
of Ice, Mother to the Infinite Cold, Celsius, hear my plea! Grant thy
power upon thy servant, the force to freeze what is live, to have
stand still what is time, and to bring destruction upon thy foes! Let
us walk the path of eternity together!</I>”</P><P>Naminè
knew this spell from a book she had read in library in Hollow
Bastion, which told about the lords of the elements. They were
dangerous beings, much stronger than the beings that were called upon
in a summon. They were the ultimate incarnation of the element
itself. It was dangerous alone to use a recitation with a single
spell, and trying to summon one of those was basically suicide.</P><P>Their
situation was desperate, and without such a powerful recitation,
Naminè would have failed to use another large-scale magical attack.</P><P>Kairi
reacted immediately. Olette didn't know what was going on, but was
drawn by Kairi to where Naminè was. In the first seconds nothing
happened.</P><P>“Naminè,
are you okay? Just what was that spell you used? I never heard Aerith
calling upon Celsius. Whom did you ask for power?”</P><P>Before
Naminè could answer that, she felt the spell starting to take
form—but it was uncontrollable and much too strong. Naminè got
scared and tried to disrupt the spell flow, but it was already too
late.</P><P>Right
below them, the ice gave a cracking sound. The air around them cooled
down so rapidly that they started coughing. Something was
wrong—horribly wrong—with that spell.</P><P>“Naminè,
what did you do?” Olette asked, trying to suppress the pain in her
lungs and continue breathing. The temperature must have been way
below zero degrees.</P><P>“I
tried to get power from the Spirit Lord of Ice, Celsius. But
something went wrong. I couldn't control the spell, and the power is
much too great for what I asked.”</P><P>“I
only asked you to—” Kairi could not finish her line.</P><P>Below
them, the ice broke and another level of ice, massive and much bigger
than before, formed around them. It expanded rapidly, and soon, the
ice bridge had vanished, and a gigantic platform of ice had formed in
its place. It wasn't as smooth as the magical ice, and it wasn't
even. All over the place monstrous spikes were rising from the
ground. The whole place looked like a hell of ice.</P><P>“I
think this is overdoing it a bit...” Olette said and looked around.</P><P>In
the same moment, it started snowing. In the middle of the south sea,
it started snowing.</P><P>“At
least we can fight now,” Kairi said, and started looking for the
enemy. “Olette, you try to confront him in close range. I will try
to back you up. Naminè, as soon as you feel good enough, try to
support us with curative magic. And both of you, try to keep moving.
It should be much harder for the enemy to hit us when we're split up
moving.”</P><P>As
soon as the instruction was given, the three of them left to
different sides.</P><P>“Ace
of Clubs, Long Arch's Whip. Seven of Clubs, Roaring Air. Nine of
Clubs, Sixteen Slashes!” the voice echoed from above them.</P><P>Up
there, over twenty feet above them, was the man, standing on a
oversized card.</P><P>“The
King of Diamonds...I didn't hear him using that one before,” Kairi
said. The effects of the cards he just used were unknown. The Ace was
directed at Olette, the Seven at herself, and the Nine at Naminè.</P><P>“Keep
moving! Use the terrain to your advantage!” Kairi yelled.</P><P>The
first card to take action was the Ace. Olette could feel it coming.
With a fast left turn, she avoided the first impact. A boulder of ice
was sliced in half and then destroyed. The flowing ice dust revealed
what had caused the damage—a whip, seemingly made of air. Olette
looked around, trying to find a way to get close to the enemy, but
there was nothing remotely high enough to reach him.</P><P>Kairi
was next. She had already a good idea of what was coming. Right
behind her, something was roaring over the ice, like a miniature
tornado that was following her. Jumping on one of the ice spikes, she
tricked the effect and it crashed into the spike. “Seems he isn't
used to Club cards,” Kairi noticed. “Naminè! Use a reflect
spell!”</P><P>Something
was coming up on her; Naminè immediately got goosebumps. Kairi told
her to use reflect, but for that she had to stop moving. Would there
be enough time? A fast recitation would have to do.</P><P>“<I>Jewel's
Mirror, Erolis, protect me!</I>”</P><P>It
was barely in time. The reflect was up and just a split second later,
exactly sixteen impacts clashed onto the spell.</P><P>That
was enough for Kairi. If the spell names described the attacks so
accurately, it was stupid to call the names out like that. Why was he
doing it?</P><P>“I've
never seen a ice spell of this scale.”</P><P>The
man was talking loudly enough for them all to hear it, even though
they were over fifty feet apart from each other.</P><P>“I
am Luxord, the Gambler. This game is becoming very interesting.”</P><P>“You're
sick if you think of this as game!” Olette shouted. She was still
looking for a possibility to reach him up there. Maybe it was time to
use <I>that.</I></P><P>“But
of course is this a game. You're not telling me that you've been
fighting me seriously up to now, are you?”</P><P>Olette
could only shake her head in incomprehension. At the beginning, she
had thought of fighting the Heartless as kind of a game, not so
different from Struggle. But Olette soon noticed that it wasn't
something to enjoy. It was a battle, something very serious, and she
had learned that the hard way.</P><P>It
was more than clear than Luxord was enjoying himself. Even though
they had managed to get away from his cards so far and avoid any
major injuries, he was out of reach and didn't have the same level of
exhaustion.</P><P>Kairi
tried to analyze the situation. He was using cards as his ability
resource. From the looks of it, Club cards served range attacks and
Spade cards close range. The other two were not as clear, as he was
using a Diamond card to float up there and had used a Heart card to
completely deflect Olette's first attack. What else could those two
suits do?</P><P>Naminè
was running. She had almost reached Kairi. It was too dangerous for
her to be too far away from the other two. If Luxord would get at her
with a Spade...</P><P>“Let
the true game begin!”</P><P>And
it did. Luxord ceased his use of King of Diamonds, and with a
not-so-elegant impact, crushed down the thick ice, leaving a little
crater around the impact point.</P><P>“Ace
of Clubs, Three of Four!”</P><P>The
card was frozen halfway, the dices rolling. Four. Another Four. The
last one was still spinning. Kairi had a good idea of what the cards
did, but the dice thing was a complete mystery.</P><P>“Three
of Four, Wheel of Repeat!” Luxord jubilated when the Ace of Clubs
started working and launched multiple attacks against Kairi and
Naminè, who were standing at least fifty feet away from Olette.</P><P>They
had no time to lose and started running. From the past attacks, Kairi
could already say that the value of the card was a rough estimate of
the attack power. And the Ace was the highest value in a game...</P><P>On
a wild run from the invisible whip attacks, Kairi came up with a
possible way to attack Luxord. The card was just a tool—a mindless
mechanic that did its job until it was done.</P><P>Cutting
a edge, Kairi turned away, trying to spot Luxord. He was in close
combat with Olette. The moment she saw the two, an explosion rose
around them, wrapping them in ice dust.</P><P>“Ace
of Spades, Impact!”</P><P>But
Olette had found a way to counter. Both Keyblades served as shield,
crossed before her, taking the impact and countering with a equal
force of brutality.</P><P>“King
of Hearts, Wa—” He was too late.</P><P>Olette
whirled around and kicked Luxord in the abdomen and following with a
double horizon slash that sent the Organization member flying. He
crashed into a boulder of ice.</P><P>If
there was one thing she had learned, then it was that people had no
mercy on the battlefield. Before Luxord could get up, Olette was
already above him, roaring through mid-air with Keyblades directed at
him. The impact was enough to leave a five-foot crater around them.</P><P>Luxord
had escaped.</P><P>The
Ace of Clubs card was still working; it was seemingly now redirected
at Olette, who had to make a run for it. For her, the fastest of the
three, it wasn't much of a problem to evade the ranged attacks of the
card.</P><P>Kairi's
plan had failed upon the re-direction of the card, but at least
Naminè, who had been using reflect spells to defend against the
Clubs card, was now safe. For now.</P><P>Where
was Luxord? Kairi could only think it once before he appeared out of
nowhere behind her, already setting for a card.</P><P>“Queen
of Spades, Hammer Hilt Bash!”</P><P>Kairi
could feel the impact. It was breath-robbing, and if not for her
daily training, it could easily have blown her lights out. However,
she had already a plan for such a scenario. Before the impact was
fully over, Kairi de-materialized Oathkeeper and grabbed Luxord's arm
with both hands, taking him along on the flight of the impact.</P><P>Luxord
was so taken by surprise that he was unable to move or act. Seconds
later, he could feel massive ice on his back, and see how Kairi, now
materializing Oathkeeper, was about to launch a attack.</P><P>“Ace
of Hearts, Absolute Protection.”</P><P>He
was barely in time. Kairi had used the momentum of the flight to
attack him head-on, and the shock wave upon Oathkeeper clashing onto
the barrier was enough to push Luxord further into the ice.</P><P>“Queen
of Dia—” He couldn't play the card in time.</P><P>Luxord
took too much time playing his cards. It was impossible for him to
play two cards this close in succession. Kairi already had turned
once, and was about to unleash the next attack, aiming for his head.
“You can't run!” she yelled, closing in.</P><P>“Ace
of Hearts, Absolute Protection.”</P><P>He
was slow. Too slow. Kairi was half-through the barrier when the card
took effect. Even though it influenced her aim, she managed to pierce
Luxord's right arm. Blood clung to Oathkeeper's blade, the yell of
pain went through her head. This was a battle, not a playground.</P><P>“Ace
of Diamonds, Dimension Door!”</P><P>Kairi
had no time to disrupt him with another attack. The Ace of Hearts had
pushed her back, and a good five feet separated her from the enemy.
He was gone.</P><P>But
Kairi knew he was there. Somewhere.</P><P>“King
of Hearts, Particle of Life!”</P><P>The
words echoed over the place. Kairi had not only caused him to flee
for a second. She had also stopped the Ace of Clubs card from
working, which finally give Olette a chance to catch her breath.</P><P>He
was a stronger foe than anything Kairi had ever met. Truly, the
Organization was powerful. But to be this powerful, there must be
some flaw.</P><P>“Ace
of Spades, Impact!”</P><P>Again,
he appeared out of thin air, this time attacking Naminè, who was
unable to block a hit that close in that short of time. The attack
was strong enough to make her fly over twenty feet. She crashed into
a pillar of ice, losing consciousness.</P><P>“This
game will end with three to zero for me.” The man laughed and
again, he played the Ace of Diamonds. It didn't look like he wanted
to finish Naminè.</P><P>Olette
caught up to Kairi, who was running over to Naminè. The enemy was
not to be trusted, Kairi had to make sure Naminè wasn't badly
injured. But it only looked like she had lost consciousness from the
impact.</P><P>“Three
of Three, Jack of Spades, Storm Lancer.”</P><P>He
appeared right between them, standing there like it was natural to be
almost back-to-back with the enemy.</P><P>And
again, time seemed to stand still. The dices were rolling. Kairi had
to do something about those dices. The last time he got Three of
Four, the Ace he played was working on a endless repeat. Whatever
Three of Three did, it couldn't be good. But luck was with them; the
first was a six. Second a five. Third a two.</P><P>The
card Luxord was playing vanished into nothingness, leaving his
defense completely open. Kairi took immediately advantage of that,
rushing at Luxord. Olette did the same.</P><P>Seconds
later, both his sides were slashed. As Kairi passed left, Olette
passed right. It was worth the try and Kairi grabbed Olette's hand,
taking a turn on the ice. She whirled around and sent the brunette
flying at the wounded Organization member. It was head-on, he was
taken by surprise, unable to do anything before Olette could land her
attack.</P><P>But
the second Olette would have landed a hit, the enemy was gone. Not
there. Something was wrong, and the first clue was that there wasn't
any blood on either Circle of Life or Hero's Crest.</P><P>“That
sure was unexpected. I thought you were just little girls. I think
it's time I stop giving you advantages and play a bit more
seriously.”</P><P>The
voice seemed to come from above. Had they attacked a illusion? But
when did he create one? Just how many tricks had this man up his
sleeve?</P><P>No
more words came, instead Kairi could feel something behind her.
Olette was about to point at something on her back when Kairi felt a
familiar impact and got sent flying directly at Olette. Kairi would
take her with her unless Olette was able to evade. Even so, Olette
did nothing of that sort. She stomped once on the ice, increasing
her grip, and crossed both Keyblades in front of her as if she were
defending.</P><P>Kairi
had only a guess what Olette was about to do, but that was the only
logical explanation for what she did. Trying her best, Kairi managed
to move in mid-air. Now her feet were directed at the crossed
Keyblades. The impact sent pain up her legs. It was like her bones
were breaking. Olette was pushed back about a foot, leaving scars in
the ice. She gritted her teeth in pain, then sent Kairi right back in
the direction she came from.</P><P>Luxord
was surprised enough to have left his defense open. Kairi was unable
to hit him with Oathkeeper; instead she fell into a frontal tackle,
ripping him off his stance. He crashed into the same pillar Naminè
had crashed into, definitely causing some damage to the Organization
member. He spat some blood and Kairi was sure she heard something
cracking.</P><P>That
was enough for the flaxen-haired man. This was no longer a simple
game for entertainment. He wanted to kill them. No matter how
important they were, if he died here, all his moves would be for
naught.</P><P>Once
again, he vanished, just to appear a split second later behind
Olette. He attacked with the Ace of Spades, vanished again, and then
appeared before Kairi and used the Eight of Spades. The force was
enough to break the pillar and leave Kairi laying on the ground. Her
left arm was cut all over the place from ice shards, and she was
losing blood. Worse, Kairi had fallen unconscious. Only Olette was
left.</P><P>“I'm
not going to make the same error a second time. I'm going to win with
a royal flush!”</P><P>His
voice was not amused anymore; it was cold and cruel. He stood above
Kairi, seemingly thinking on how to finish her off.</P><P>“<I>...let
the inferno self massacre my enemy!</I>”</P><P>A
giant fireball flew over the ice, melting anything below it and
leaving a enormous explosion upon the impact on Luxord. The man was
burning, set on fire, and screaming in pain.</P><P>Naminè
had regained consciousness and recited a Firega. It was buying them
time. Luxord had broken out in panic and was trying to diminish the
fire, still screaming in pain.</P><P>“<I>Great
Forest of Life, grant thy child the blessing of life!</I>”</P><P>Naminè
used a Curera spell on Kairi, trying to get her back to
consciousness.</P><P>Olette
was having problems wielding her Keyblades. The previous action had
put a lot of stress on her muscles and it was hard to ignore the
aching pain in her arms. But right now was a chance to test <I>that</I>.</P><P>Running
with all her might, ignoring the numb feeling in her feet, Olette got
closer to the burning Luxord by the second. She had practiced this
move over and over with Tifa, and while it was a bad idea to use it
with her arms like that, this could be the decisive attack.</P><P>Luxord
had regained some of his cool. With all his concentration, he caused
first a crater in the ice with the Ace of Spades. But before the
second Ace could work, Olette started her attack. Throwing both
Keyblades right and left past Luxord, she quickly closed in on him.</P><P>“Ace
of Hear—”</P><P>“Too
slow!” Olette yelled, and landed a furious punch on Luxord's
abdomen. She could feel one or two bones breaking, but half her body
was already numb from the cold. Suppressing the urge to yell out in
pain, she turned and set on the same spot a kick. Again, something
definitely broke, and Luxord was sent flying.</P><P>The
Keyblades Olette had thrown were on their way back, crossing the
air-line of Luxord. Both his sides got cut, and he still continued to
fly, finally crashing into a pillar of ice over thirty feet away. The
impact caused the pillar to break, burying the man under massive ice.</P><P>Olette
could not bear it anymore. She fell on her back and screamed out in
agony, feeling through all the numbness from the cold the pain of
broken bones in her hands and legs.</P><P>Meanwhile,
Kairi had regained consciousness even though she was barely able to
stand. It had become a battle of endurance. The cold was making her
senses numb, and it was adding the pain of frostbite to the other
injuries. It was hard on Naminè, but without a powerful cure spell,
they would lose their lives.</P><P>Kairi
got up, supported by Naminè, and walked over to where Olette was
lying on the ice, trying to suppress the urge to scream out further.</P><P>It
did seem like either Luxord had either passed out or he was dead.
Kairi hoped for the latter. They weren't in any condition to finish
him off anyway.</P><P>“Naminè,
just try a cure spell. The strongest you have. We need to get away
from here quickly.”</P><P>Naminè
had not taken as much damage as it seemed, upon the impact on the
pillar. “I will try my best.”</P><P>“<I>Blessing
of the Moon, shine down upon us.</I>”</P><P>More
than a Curera spell was just plain impossible.</P><P>“Do
you think he is...?” Naminè couldn't say it. It was hard to grab
the reality of actually having helped to kill someone.</P><P>“I
hope so. It didn't look like he was going to spare me,” Kairi
replied.</P><P>“If
he survived that blow,” Olette gritted her teeth upon feeling that
her bones were being fixed by magic—a very painful method compared
to natural healing. “Then he should at least be out cold for a
while. But I don't think I...really did it.”</P><P>It
wasn't easy for Olette either. Taking on Heartless and Nobodies was
one thing. But this was different. He was alive, a person with a free
will. She did feel bad about it, but Olette knew that there had been
little choice. It was him or them.</P><P>Something
cracked. Olette yelled out in pain and rolled over. The bones were
fixed, but she was on the verge of passing out from the pain.</P><P>“I
will finish this. If we don't, he will come back soon enough. Olette,
Naminè, wait here. This is not something I want either of you to
have to witness.”</P><P>Kairi
stood up and gathered her concentration. It was hard to do so, not
only because magic cure was painful for the body if used for greater
wounds, but also because of the frostbite from the ice that the girls
had all over the place.</P><P>The
other two didn't move an inch. Was Kairi really going to...?</P><P>Only
a few feet separated Kairi from the place where Luxord had crashed
into the ice pillar. It was untouched. If he really was still there,
he had to be unconscious.</P><P>Kairi
would not take the risk of being victim to a surprise attack. It was
just ice. Nothing a single Firera spell couldn't solve.</P><P>Directing
Oathkeeper at the wild pile of crushed ice, a fireball emerged from
it, flying over and clashing onto the ice. It wasn't enough. Whatever
had caused Naminè's spell to go wild, this ice was far beyond
anything Kairi had ever seen.</P><P>Another
set of Firera later, the ice had melted away. There was nothing below
it. But how could there be nothing? Kairi couldn't believe her eyes.
She got closer, watching the surroundings. Several things in Kairi's
head were spinning. Using magic in her condition was dangerous.</P><P>There
really was nothing. But how had he escaped? Olette's all-out attack
should have knocked him out. And if only sitting and lying on the ice
caused severe frostbite to them, what would being buried alive do to
someone? Something was wrong.</P><P>As
fast as her legs allowed her to, Kairi got back to the other two.</P><P>“He
wasn't there!”</P><P>Naminè
didn't seem to mind much; it was more that she was relieved that
Kairi didn't have to kill someone. But Olette was shocked.</P><P>“What?
I hit him so hard that I broke my bones! He should have at least been
knocked out. Are you sure he didn't hide somewhere under the ice?”</P><P>Kairi
hit Oathkeeper in the ground, cutting a little piece of ice out of
it. She didn't dare to pick it up with bare hands. Instead, she
pierced it with her Keyblade.</P><P>“This
stuff is incredibly cold. We're getting frostbite by just sitting and
laying on it. I don't think he would survive long if he really were
buried under there. I didn't think about that before. That was my
fault. He somehow escaped. And I have a feeling this is not the last
we'll see of him.”</P><P>Kairi
threw the piece of ice away but didn't dematerialize Oathkeeper. The
enemy could still be close by. Now that they knew he had escaped a
freezing death, they had to be even more cautious.</P><P>“Stick
close to each other. Olette ,can you walk? What about you, Naminè,
are you okay?”</P><P>Even
though Olette's bones had just been fixed and it would hurt like hell
to walk anywhere, she nodded. Naminè was mentally exhausted but also
gave Kairi an okay nod.</P><P>Looking
closely at the two, Kairi was thinking how she was unable to protect
them from the fate of a Keyblader. Even though she had given it her
all, it was not enough. It was mortifying to admit that.</P><P>Olette
leaned on Kairi, and Naminè walked close behind them. The gateway
was nearby, but the risk of Luxord attacking them now, when they were
wounded and vulnerable, was high.</P><P>“Direct
your Keyblades at this point. Focus your thoughts on nothing but the
gateway. You will feel a bit of a mental strain, but that will only
be temporary.” Kairi finished her instructions and waited for the
others to follow her example.</P><P>There
was nothing in the air. On the point Oathkeeper, Monochrome and
Circle of Life met each other, something slowly started to form. Too
slowly. Had they passed the time limit?</P><P>The
keyhole was now visible, but the mental strain was much harder than
expected. They were far over time, but they had little choice. They
could go back to the island, but the keyhole would have completely
vanished by the time they could try again, and staying on the ice
platform was not even an option.</P><P>“My
head hurts like crap,” Olette complained but held out.</P><P>“We're
almost there.” Kairi knew that was a lie. They would barely be able
to open it at this rate.</P><P>Going
all out, the portal finally materialized and opened up. The pain in
Kairi's head was almost strong enough to make her pass out. Only a
few more seconds...</P><P>“That's
big enough to go through one at a time.” Kairi couldn't take it
much longer.</P><P>“Naminè,
go first, then you, Olette. I'll follow after you two.”</P><P>The
portal wavered in the moment Naminè passed through. The missing
Keyblade immediately showed an effect—the gateway seemed to be more
instable than ever.</P><P>“Are
you sure this is supposed to...are you okay, Kairi?” Olette got a
bit curious. Kairi was completely pale, even though she hadn't looked
that bad before.</P><P>“I'm
fine. Now go, I have no idea how long this thing will stay open.”
Kairi rarely lost her cool, but this didn't allow any further delay.</P><P>Olette
sort of understood and immediately jumped through the gate. Another
missing Keyblade seemed to be too much for the gate. It wavered, then
broke down.</P><P>“What...Kairi!”</P><P>The
portal was closed. It was finally over. Now they could go back to
Hollow Bastion.</P><P>Kairi
had no power left, neither to think nor to stand. The moon was still
shining bright on the massive ice platform. It was cold, freezing and
silent. Kairi couldn't even hear her own voice anymore. She was
completely exhausted in mind and body, unable to speak or move.</P><P>Looking
in the sky, where the stars were shining, Kairi could now feel a
sense of regret. It was stupid to sneak out to another world alone.
If she hadn't been that foolish, all this wouldn't have happened. But
what else was left but regret?</P><P>She
could barely see the sky. If they had tried with their usual means,
the portal wouldn't have opened. Kairi had had to sacrifice more
energy than she had imagined, but she had kept her promise. They
could now go back to Hollow Bastion.</P><P>The
night was getting darker. Her legs refused to work, and her arms
couldn't hold the Keyblade. Was this it? Kairi knew that being a
Chosen was bound to be risky, but that those risks would demand their
price so soon was unexpected. She had always been wary and acted
tactical.</P><P>Unable
to move, Kairi stood there, not knowing what now would come. The ice
must have been freezing her body, as she couldn't feel anything.
Slowly, her legs gave out, and Kairi fell on the ice. It was not
cold.</P><P>Next
to her, on the ground, lay Oathkeeper. After all that happened, she
couldn't keep the other promise she had made.</P><P>“<I>I'll
find you two, no matter where you go!”</I></P><P>Kairi
couldn't even cry. The ice was freezing her tears on the spot.</P><P>Soon,
her eyes closed and all got dark. It was a welcome darkness, numbing
her thoughts.</P><P>No
long after, even her mind was blank.</P><P>And
then, only nothingness remained.</P><p align='center'>----Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“It
won't work. Why won't it work?!” Olette was furious. The thought of
what was happening to Kairi was eating at her insides. Her anger
mixed with fear and Olette left all rationality behind her, trying to
open the gateway that had crumbled behind her.</P><P>Naminè
sat there, unable to think. Where was Kairi? What was happening? The
shock was immense and Naminè was unable to comprehend anything.</P><P>Minutes
that lingered for ages went by and Olette, exhausted and in horrible
pain from the wounds all over her body, continued to rage, trying to
open the portal. Even with two Keyblades, it refused to work. It
didn't even show any sign that there still <I>was</I> a portal.</P><P>“She...she
will find another way. I'm sure. Kairi isn't going to stay on that
dammed island. I'm sure she is going to be all 'Surprise! You two
fell for it' when we meet up.”</P><P>Olette
wanted to believe it. She really did. But for now, she didn't know
anything about what had really happened to Kairi, not even if she was
still alive. That thought was paralyzing her body. The simple thought
of Kairi not coming back, never seeing her again, was horrifying.</P><P>“Olette...can
we go somewhere?” Naminè believed what Olette said. The idea of
giving up on Kairi was too much to even consider.</P><P>There
were no words that had to be said. Olette couldn't say “She might
not be coming back.” She refused to believe it herself.</P><P>“I...don't
think Kairi will leave this world. We should look for her. Let's take
the next portal. I can't explain why, but I have a feeling that she
won't go back to Hollow Bastion. Not like this.” Olette clung to
that idea. She really thought that Kairi was still on the ice
platform, but that thought was like poison.</P><P>“Hm.”
Naminè could barely speak. She believed in Olette and in Kairi.
Believed in Kairi to come back to her.</P><P>Olette
was aching all over the place, but she was able to walk. The inside
of the gateway was as dark as ever. There must be another portal to
this world. It was hard to concentrate when her whole body was a road
of pain, but it was necessary.</P><P>Naminè
was still a bit numb from the mental exhaustion. It barely allowed
her to gather her thoughts on what she would say to Kairi when they
met again.</P><P>Time
went by, and the more it did, the more clear it was to Olette how
slim the chances were for Kairi to escape the freezing hell. Even if
she managed to go back to the island...</P><P>“Say,
Olette...do you think we will see Kairi soon?” It was like Naminè
was putting a needle in Olette's heart.</P><P>“Yeah.
We will.” She didn't look back. She couldn't.</P><P>How
would Naminè react when she found out that Kairi was...?</P><P>But
that wasn't even sure yet! Olette wanted to think positively. She had
to!</P><P>Both
of them silently continued to walk. A eternity later, Olette stopped.
How long had they been walking? One hour? One day? She had no sense
of time anymore. Her mind was pure chaos, everything seemed to focus
on Kairi.</P><P>Olette
rarely cried about anything, but she had reached her limit. Cold
tears ran over her face as she finally let out what had been building
up ever since the portal closed.</P><P>“Olette,
are you crying?” Naminè seemed to be able to look right through
other people.</P><P>“It's
just my body hurting like hell,” tried Olette, desperate to escape
the reality of the situation.</P><P>Yes.
It was only her body that was hurt. How could she admit to herself
that her heart was just as much hurt? Since when did she care that
much for Kairi?</P><P>A
second later, Olette could feel Naminè embracing her from behind.
Olette was not eager to be comforted by Naminè. This situation
wasn't one that would be fixed by such simple things.</P><P>“I'm
hurt too...” said Naminè, and from her voice, Olette knew
immediately that it wasn't just her that was crying bitter tears.</P><P>For
now, the brunette was okay with this. Maybe Naminè instinctively
knew what really was going on. Maybe not. It didn't matter to her.
She could feel Naminè's tears on her back. It was okay to cry in
such a moment, wasn't it? It must be...</P><P>Standing
like that for a while, Olette tried to get back to thinking a bit
more realistically. Kairi wasn't that weak. She wasn't dumb, either.
Kairi wouldn't sacrifice her life like that. She must have had some
kind of plan.</P><P>Naminè
didn't move one inch the whole time. She didn't know why, but her
heart was aching even more than her head. It was like a needle of
stone that pierced right through her. A undeniable truth was coming
to her. It hurt to even think about it.</P><P>“Will
we really...see Kairi again?” Naminè's voice was barely audible,
so faint was she.</P><P>“Kairi
will find us. You know her. She probably has a plan for all this. I
don't think she can manage a portal on her own, so she'll try to meet
us somewhere in this world. We're together, we should be able to open
a small portal.”</P><P>Olette
was, for once, in the position where she had to cheer Naminè up. She
herself only believed in parts of what she said, but to believe was
better than giving up all hope.</P><P>“Hm,
I think you're right.”</P><P>It
was really good to hear that from Naminè. It enforced her belief
that Kairi was still somewhere out there.</P><P>Naminè
took a deep breath and let Olette go. The crying had helped to put
her mind at ease.</P><P>“Let's
look for a portal,” Olette said.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Things
didn't look very bright. A unknown town, nowhere to go. The fading
hope that Kairi was still alive. It was as if the dark clouds of the
night were showing their feelings. It was cold, but not because of
night. It was her. She was missing.</P><P>“Kairi...”</P><P>Naminè
still couldn't fully comprehend it. Ever since she had come to Hollow
Bastion, they had been together. But Olette had said that she would
see Kairi again. It wasn't a eternal farewell.</P><P>Olette
looked around. Even at night, the town didn't look very pleasant.
Trash in the streets, rowdy sounds from the tavern nearby, and a
disgusting smell polluted the air. No question, this was not a
appropriate place for two young girls. To top it off, they were
injured, hungry, and exhausted, both mental and physically. Even a
Keyblader couldn't go on nonstop.</P><P>“Let's
find somewhere to stay for the rest of the night,” Olette said, and
Naminè just gave a single nod.</P><P>But
without money, where would they stay? Olette had never bothered to
think about it. What would they do for food and water? In such a
place, a teenage girl finding work just didn't seem likely. The only
choice left was nothing Olette would be proud of. But what choice did
they have?</P><P>After
walking through a few streets and taking a few minutes' rest on a
wall, Naminè was so exhausted that she had fallen asleep. Olette had
to carry her piggyback from this point on.</P><P>A
bit later, Olette walked down a nasty-smelling street, not knowing
what unpleasant surprise waited for them. Right before them, a whole
bunch of drunkards came out a tavern. It immediately reeked of bad
news, and Olette turned around and tried to get away, but one of the
men called out.</P><P>“
'Ay, what two fine
youn' gals we have her'...”</P><P>His
voice was deep and rough. Olette ignored it and walked faster. Her
muscles were aching, burning, and if she overdid it, all healing
wouldn't help her regain her power.</P><P>“Hey,
wait up, ye brat!” one of the pirates yelled out and started to go
after the girls.</P><P>She
had no chance to escape. Alone, maybe, but leaving Naminè to those
bastards was out of the question. Fight them? Fighting Heartless was
one thing...but fighting humans? She couldn't do that. Not in this
condition anyway.</P><P>Olette
wanted to run and get away from those men. The day had been long
enough, longer than any day before. She'd lost Kairi, and if she lost
Naminè or herself now, her will to keep walking would completely
fade.</P><P>“I
said, wait up, ye damn brat!” One of the men grabbed her shoulder.</P><P>He
was at least two heads taller than Olette and muscular. He had a wild
and rough face and was reeking very badly of alcohol.</P><P>“Leave
me alone!” Olette shouted and tried to get free.</P><P>“Ah,
I dun' think so, gal. We'll have some fun with yer little friend
here.”</P><P>Olette
was desperate. Naminè was such a pure girl. If anything happened to
her, if she ever met Kairi again...Olette wouldn't be able to face
her. She wouldn't be able to forgive herself if anything happened to
her.</P><P>Even
if Naminè was sometimes an annoyance...she was a close friend.</P><P>“I
said, let me go. If you touch her, you'll regret it.”</P><P>“Heya,
heard what this little bitch said? We'll regret it, ha!”</P><P>Another
of the men was standing in front of Olette and looking at her. The
smell of alcohol almost made Olette vomit. It was so disgusting, she
almost couldn't bear breathing.</P><P>“Maybe
we'll have some fun with ye first!” another one said.</P><P>The
man behind her had now grabbed both her shoulders to have her stay
put. It hurt, both physically because of her injuries, and mentally,
because she was unable to do anything.</P><P>Seconds
later, Olette could feel a rough and bulky hand on her face, then on
her chest. She had never imagined what it would be like to be raped,
but this was already much worse than anything she ever lived through.</P><P>Olette
loathed the men. She wished the Heartless would attack and rob them
of their mind. Or that she was able to fight, to kill them. Olette
was on the verge of dropping Naminè, and summoning her Keyblade to
hack off those dirty hands that—</P><P>One
of the men, right behind her, gave off a disgusting sound. A split
second later, the others drew their weapons and something fell to
ground. Olette managed to look over her shoulder, and one of the men
was lying on the ground next to an iron hammer that had apparently
hit his face.</P><P>“That's
far enough! That's no way to treat two young ladies!” A male voice
came from the entrance of a nearby house. Only his silhouette was
visible, but one thing was clear. He was holding a sword-like weapon.</P><P>“Who's
there?! Show yerself, bastard!”</P><P>“There's
no need to tell some drunkards my name.”</P><P>That
behavior...could it be? Jack Sparrow? But that was clearly not his
voice.</P><P>“I
tell ye, yer gonna regret meddling with my fun, bastard!” One of
the men said, and the rest of them also drew their weapons.</P><P>Olette
was released. Their attention had been drawn to the man who had
obviously thrown the hammer. Not hesitating one second, Olette walked
away as fast as she could. Running was no option, not like this, not
while carrying Naminè. The sound of clashing swords echoed through
the streets, clearly audible for Olette.</P><P>It
hurt inside, hurt her pride as a fighter, that she was just running
away, when someone had stood up to save her. But what if that man had
had the same intentions? Was just saving them to assault them later?</P><P>Deep
inside, Olette swore never to trust anyone in this town.</P><P>Minutes
after, when Olette was on the verge of collapsing, the sword sounds
had dried up. If they came after her and found them, there would be
no escape. Olette would have no strength to even protect Naminè.</P><P>Next
to her was a building for what seemed like storage. On its side was a
hole in the wall, like a window without glass, right next to a bunch
of chests. Olette could barely believe that something this convenient
existed, but after a day full of suffering, she truly could have shed
tears about this little ray of fortune.</P><P>With
her last bit of power, Olette climbed the chests, still carrying
Naminè, and managed to enter the building. The landing was quite
rough, and her body screamed in pain, but they were finally safe.</P><P>Unable
to even look for something to cover herself and Naminè, Olette
leaned against the blond girl and fell asleep.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>It
was dark around her, a deeper darkness than any night, a darkness
that even devoured the light. Was she alive? Was she dead? Where was
this place?</P><P>It
seemed like she spent an eternity walking in the darkness, unable to
feel anything, until she reached a place where a faraway light was
shining. It came closer each second, and after her eyes got used to
the blinding light, she gasped.</P><P>Before
her stood three girls, Kairi, Naminè and Olette. All three of them
smiling. She wanted to call out to them, call their names. But her
voiced had dried up. Not a tune came out, not a single sound.</P><P>Desperation
was grabbing her soul. The three girls were just standing there,
smiling, not seeing her. Why couldn't she call out to them?!</P><P>Slowly,
the light faded, and their smiles vanished. First, Kairi disappeared,
leaving behind Olette and Naminè. Both of them were now showing sad
faces, but getting closer. Naminè was being comforted by Olette,
both of them looking as sad as a ocean of tears.</P><P>The
light was getting weaker, and soon, the image vanished. Only
darkness, ultimate impenetrable darkness, remained.</P><P>She
wanted to cry out, to grab the last fading straw of light, but she
couldn't. It was like a chain, a icy cold chain paralyzing her body.</P><P>She
didn't know how long she remained in darkness, but it seemed like
forever. But the pain never stopped. The pain about losing Kairi.
Would the pain never stop?</P><P>Not
light, but a image appeared before her. A dark image, showing
something she had never wanted to see in her life.</P><P>It
was Hollow Bastion, on a rainy and dark night. Most of the people she
knew and had come to like were standing in a circle. She could feel
the rain pouring on her, could feel a immeasurable pain...if one
could lose a part of their soul, then this pain must be comparable to
that.</P><P>She
both wanted to look what was inside the circle and not. A inner voice
was telling her not to look, to run away from this...</P><P>But
before she could avert her eyes, the people before her, Aerith and
Tifa, opened a window of sight for her. If she could have cried, she
would've. If she could have screamed out, she would've. It was like
her mind was breaking.</P><P>It
was a coffin, open and decorated with flowers. Next to it, a girl was
kneeling with a Keyblade. Her face was warped in pain.</P><P>She
wanted to see the inside of the coffin and not. Wanted to be certain.
In that moment, the girl looked back, right at where she was, and her
eyes were asking just one thing.</P><P>“<I>Why?!</I>”</P><P>She
could now see the inside of the coffin. In there was...</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>It
was a rainy day. The sun was hidden beneath the clouds and the ocean
was fighting a eternal battle for superiority against the land. The
atmosphere was dark and depressed.</P><P>Olette's
eyes were frozen in shock. She could only gaze at the empty wall,
unable to comprehend, unable to think, unable to move. She just sat
there, staring at the wooden wall.</P><P>“Kairi...”</P><P>Something
next to her moved. She finally snapped out of it. Was it...a dream?</P><P>“It's
cold...”</P><P>Naminè
was next to her. Naminè was really next to her. She was not...</P><P>“Olette..are
you...okay?” Naminè's voice was watery, as if she were about to
cry.</P><P>Was
she the only one to have that dream? Olette reacted to what Naminè
said by shaking her head and looking around for something to cover
them up with.</P><P>Nothing
much was there, but something like a cover blanket was on some boxes
in the store. Olette took it, every muscle of her body aching from
the day before, and gave it to Naminè.</P><P>Only
then did she notice that she was shivering and half her body was
partially numb from the cold. But before she could say anything,
Naminè had moved really close to her, sharing the blanket.</P><P>“You
must be cold too,” Naminè said.</P><P>“Thanks.”</P><P>It
was weird. If this had happened with Kairi, Olette would have
probably jumped away and boasted that she wasn't cold. Or just sat
there, silent and red like a tomato. Now that she had lost her, it
was quite clear that she had liked Kairi, and in a romantic way.</P><P>In
the end, that had made her and Naminè rivals in love. And to share
with her a blanket...it felt a bit weird, but not quite as awkward as
she had been imagining.</P><P>Naminè
really was close, and after Olette didn't stop shivering, she really
got worried.</P><P>“Does
your body still hurt?” Naminè was asking in a way that wanted an
absolutely honest answer.</P><P>“I
ache all over the place. My head feels like it could explode any
second, and don't even mention my left arm and leg. I am icy cold for
some reason, too...” Olette answered truthfully before she knew it.
Why was she being so trusting? She never told anyone about when she
was hurt.</P><P>Naminè
could explain the aching and the injuries to herself, but the reason
for the shivering must be something else.</P><P>With
a sudden move, Naminè knelt before Olette, being so close to her
face that Olette was short of thinking Naminè would kiss her any
second. That thought wasn't really exciting her. It felt somewhat
weird to even imagine it.</P><P>Naminè
laid her hand on Olette's forehead and immediately took it back. Her
forehead was burning. Olette must have pushed herself much too far.
She had a horrible fever, and that was anything but good.</P><P>“You
have a fever. A really bad one, too.” Naminè really was sounding
worried.</P><P>It
was then that Naminè first noticed how important a friend Olette was
to her. Up to now, her eyes had been glued to Kairi whenever they
were together. She had never really thought about what would happen
if Olette left her.</P><P>It
was a sad thought, and Naminè didn't want it as much as she didn't
want Kairi to leave.</P><P>“I
will heal your injuries as good as possible.”</P><P>“Don't
push yourself, Naminè, I—”</P><P>“I
will not lose you too!” Naminè suddenly yelled out, and Olette was
a bit shocked.</P><P>Naminè
was close to tears, and she was really surprised when she could feel
Olette's hand on her head.</P><P>“Don't
worry, stupid, I won't go anywhere.”</P><P>Olette
didn't feel weird anymore. It was still only Kairi she was interested
in, but if it was Naminè, she didn't mind being this close to her.</P><P>But
the fever forced its pay, and Olette started to shiver even worse
than before. Naminè's surprised look changed back to a worried one,
and she started to chant a healing spell. If this was all she could
do, then she would at least stay by Olette, until she was well again.</P><P>The
healing spell put Olette a bit at ease. The aching was much less than
before, and even the pain of her arm and leg nearly disappeared. Now
that the pain was gone, though, the fever made her feel even worse
than before.</P><P>Naminè
was not dumb and could see it too. She looked around and finally
found another blanket, one that was full of dust. She shook it a bit
to get rid of the dust, but that resulted only in coughing.</P><P>“Don't
push yourself. A bit of a fever isn't going to kill me,” Olette
said, knowing well that her condition wasn't the best.</P><P>“Don't
say that!” Naminè seemed a bit angry.</P><P>“I'm
sorry. If...you want to help me, you can come and stay close to me. I
felt a lot better with you next to me than all wrapped up in blankets
alone.” Olette expected to blush at asking that, or at least,
Naminè to do so. But neither happened.</P><P>Naminè
didn't say anything. She took the additional blanket, threw it over
Olette, and crawled under it.</P><P>“I
hope we find Kairi soon...”</P><P>It
was like a bad dream. All of this. Lost in another world, in a town
where they had neither money nor friends, without Kairi, and the
Organization probably still on their trails. For now, they had to
ensure their survival.</P><P>“I'm
sure she's out there.” Olette was trying to not think about it too
much.</P><P>If
Kairi really survived, that alone would be a miracle. But how would
she escape the island? How would she find Olette and Naminè? This
world was big, and the chances were slim that they would ever find
each other. But the end was really only the end if you gave up hope.</P><P>“What
are we going to do now?” Naminè was asking.</P><P>The
first water drops of a upcoming storm clashed onto the roof. Dark
clouds, deep as the night, were walling up to a wave, ready to
swallow all light. Olette was hesitant to answer. They were lost,
alone in a foreign city, and had neither food nor water.</P><P>“We'll
start looking for Kairi as soon as I get better. We need something to
eat. Water too. I'll organize something.” Olette tried her best not
to sound discouraged.</P><P>More
raindrops were falling. Soon, the storm would unleash its mighty
force. It got colder and Olette's shivering got worse by the moment.
Naminè would be a fool to not notice it and moved even closer to her
friend.</P><P>“I
miss her.”</P><P>She
felt like that too...but who wouldn't miss a close friend...or
rather...? But what use did brooding over it do? Kairi wouldn't
mystically appear just because they kept their minds occupied with
her.</P><P>“We'll
see her soon.”</P><P>It
was the best Olette could do. Naminè would not stop worrying no
matter what she said, but if she gave up hope, Naminè surely would
break down. Right now it was most important to get a grip on
themselves.</P><P>“But
she isn't here now.”</P><P>She
knew. She <I>knew</I>, dammit! But what could she do? Anger walled up
inside her, anger at herself, that she had been unable to protect her
better, anger about Naminè for keeping it up. She missed Kairi too!
And...anger at Kairi. Why had she stayed behind? Not told them about
what condition she was in? Did she trust them only that much? It
would've been better to stay together on the island than have just
the two of them alone in this town.</P><P>“I
know that. You don't need to tell me!”</P><P>Olette
bit her lips. She didn't mean to be that harsh with Naminè, but
sometimes her temper really got the better of her.</P><P>“I'm
sorry...I just wanted—” Naminè couldn't finish her line.</P><P>“I
know...sorry I snapped.”</P><P>Olette
let out a deep sigh and held her forehead. It really wasn't her day.</P><P>“At
least we're still together, right?”</P><P>Naminè
only gave her a nod. She wouldn't pursue the subject any further. It
hurt. It hurt to be separated from Kairi. It was dark and cold
without her, but she wasn't all alone. Naminè still had Olette. It
was only now that she noticed how important Olette really was to her.</P><P>“I'm
glad you're with me,” Naminè said, before leaning on Olette and
resting her head on her shoulder.</P><P>“I
feel the same way.”</P><P>Olette
could barely express how glad she was that she wasn't alone. Back in
Twilight Town, she had been all alone. Even amongst her friends, she
had been all alone. Her heart had been alone, all this time.</P><P>But
not anymore. Kairi was alive, Olette was sure. She had to be. And
Naminè was with her. And back at Hollow Bastion...at her new
home...everyone was there, waiting for her.</P><P>Rain
started to pour from the skies, as to express the sadness and ordeal
both of the girls had to face. Lightning roared across the sky, and
thunder made the clouds tremble. Far below, in a small storehouse,
two girls were sitting, snuggled up to each other.</P><P>Naminè
couldn't fall asleep. Too many things were troubling her. Was Kairi
really all right? When would she see her again? When could they
return to Hollow Bastion? Return home?</P><P>It
was hard on her, much harder than she had ever imagined. The loss of
Kairi had taken its toll, and again, her tears started to flow, now
silently and unnoticed. Soon after her thoughts had switched to
Kairi, and the tears had begun flowing, Naminè could feel a hand on
her head.</P><P>She
looked up. It was Olette, who smiled at her. Despite the situation,
she still smiled. Naminè secretly wanted to be as strong as
Olette...but it felt good to be comforted, to have someone on your
side.</P><P>It
was weird, but a moment before, Olette had just wanted to join in. To
let tears fall for once, to let her emotions run wild. But who would
be there to comfort Naminè then? She felt like it was her obligation
to do so. No...that was wrong. Not her obligation. She wanted do to
it. To be there for the fragile girl.</P><P>Seconds
after she stopped petting her head, Olette laid one hand on Naminè's
cheek. She took a tear away and raised her head a bit.</P><P>“Don't
cry. Didn't I say we find her? Don't you trust me?”</P><P>Naminè
did. She trusted Olette with her life. Kairi trusted Olette, and
Naminè felt, it would be betraying her own feelings to not trust
her. Olette had been there for her, ever since she had come to Hollow
Bastion. Ever since she had meet her.</P><P>“Will
we really find her?”</P><P>“I
promise we'll find her. Have I ever broken a promise I've made?”</P><P>Olette
had to convince herself to believe it. Yes, they would find Kairi. At
any cost.</P><P>“No.
No, you didn't.” Naminè finally stopped crying and a trace of hope
was visible in her eyes.</P><P>“So,
can you promise me something too?”</P><P>Naminè
was slightly confused but gave a nod. What could Olette want from
her?</P><P>“Can
you promise me not to cry anymore? For Kairi's sake too.”</P><P>Naminè
took a deep breath and cleaned the tears from her eyes. “I'll try.”</P><P>Naminè
couldn't help but think that in this moment, Olette was a little bit
like Kairi sometimes. It really had a soothing effect. Even if Kairi
was away...as long Olette was with her, Naminè wouldn't cry anymore.
She wanted to be strong too. Strong like Kairi and Olette.</P><P>“Promise?”
Olette asked, still smiling.</P><P>Olette
had to try so hard to smile that it was exhausting. She was just as
worried about Kairi as Naminè was, and her condition didn't make it
easier for her to cheer Naminè up. But from what she had learned,
Naminè hadn't known anything when she came to Hollow Bastion. She
hadn't known how to deal with her own feelings, with sadness,
desperation and other things. Olette had to be strong, for Naminè
too.</P><P>“Promise.”</P><P>A
short moment of silence followed, and Olette went back to letting her
mind rest. Doing all this with a fever was really something.</P><P>“You're
weird, Olette...I wouldn't be able to go on like this if you weren't
here.”</P><P>“You're
the weird one, Naminè. So weird, sometimes I have no idea what
you're thinking,” Olette said, and burst out in a small cough. She
felt awkward, but not as bad as before.</P><P>“I
can't imagine just giving up. What kind of friend would do that?”</P><P>“You...you're
right.” Naminè shook her head. Olette was right.</P><P>An
awkward silence followed, and Naminè felt like she had insulted
Olette. She wanted to make it up somehow, but nothing came to mind.</P><P>“I'm
so sorry I can't heal your fever...if only Aerith were here...I wish
I could use magic better.” Naminè sighed about her own inability.</P><P>“You're
already a fine magician, Naminè.” Olette started petting Naminè's
head again.</P><P>It
helped to put their minds off of what had caused this situation in
the first place. It gave them a slight moment of ease, a short break
in this never ending storm.</P><P>“As
soon as I get better, we'll start searching for Kairi. I know she's
out there somewhere.”</P><P>Naminè
nodded with a somewhat hopeful expression. It was so much easier to
believe if someone at your side believed too.</P><P>Silence
followed, disturbed only by the sound of Olette petting Naminè's
head. Both of them had moved together, as close as they could, almost
holding each other. The day was as dark as the night, and the dark
clouds threw their shadow over the town and an upcoming calamity.</P><p 
align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>How
long had it been? Olette had fallen asleep, with Naminè leaning onto
her. The rain was still pouring, and once in a while she could hear
thunder.</P><P>She
felt considerably better than before. Her fever must have gone down
quite a bit. Was it because of Naminè? Had she cast another healing
spell after she had fallen asleep? But right now the blond girl was
sleeping, and Olette didn't want to wake her up. Thirst and hunger
became apparent needs now, and when Naminè woke up, she would surely
have the same problems.</P><P>This
was a storehouse, after all. There must be something to drink at
least. Food was another matter. They could survive up to a week
without food. But water was a really pressing
matter.</P><P>A
few more minutes wouldn't kill her, though. As long Naminè was
asleep, Olette had time to think everything through. They had to take
measure to stay alive themselves. Had to think how to eventually
escape this world. But for now, all that was important was finding
shelter and securing food and water.</P><P>How
long would they need to stay here? One week? Two weeks? A month?
Olette had read a few books about being marooned on a island, all
alone and how people survived. But how did one survive in a town
without money, shelter or work? It really hurt her pride, but Olette
would have to resort to really low means.</P><P>No
matter how long it would be, they had to find better shelter and had
to manage food and water. Only if they secured their own survival,
then, they could start looking for Kairi. They had to find a way
back. Being a Keyblader didn't help much in such a situation, but
Naminè's magic would come in very handy, especially her ice magic.
It was the easiest and most secure way to get a steady hold of water.
For food...no magic in this world was capable of doing that. Shelter
was a different matter, but in such a old town, there should been
abandoned buildings.</P><P>“No...Kairi,
don't go...Olette...”</P><P>Naminè
was sleep talking. It was kind of cute, but it did seem she was
having a nightmare. Naminè got rather agitated and started moving
around until Olette petted her head, immediately calming her down. It
took only a few more seconds until Naminè had gone back to her
previous state, calm and peacefully sleeping.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>With
the exception of how to provide food, Olette had gotten a pretty
solid plan for what to do. It was a game against time. No matter how
long it would take, how long they had to search, how long they would
have to wait, they would find Kairi.</P><P>“Naminè,
wake up.”</P><P>Olette
purposely said it with a soft voice, trying to not startle Naminè.
It took her a few attempts until the blond girl slowly opened her
eyes, looking around her confusedly. After a few moments, Naminè
remembered where they were.</P><P>“Are
you feeling better?”</P><P>Olette
would've thought that Naminè's first question would be if there were
any news at all. News about Kairi. But it seemed even Naminè was
capable of not drowning herself into worries. It put Olette at ease,
knowing that Naminè was not breaking down.</P><P>“Much
better. Thanks to you, Naminè.”</P><P>Olette
again petted her head, it had become sort of a habit. She had wanted
to protect Naminè, and if it was at the cost of her life. For the
first time in her life, Olette felt that she finally had found
something important to protect. Whatever the future held, whatever
danger was lay ahead, Olette would protect her. Protect Naminè.</P><P>The
rain still was coming down. Would it ever stop? Night had come, and
it was as dark as the path between the worlds. They were hungry and
thirsty, so Naminè started looking inside the boxes.</P><P>In
most were stuff like the swill Jack Sparow had drunk on the island.
At least, it smelled in the same unpleasant way. Further back Naminè
had found some dried fruits and bread that was old and nasty but
still edible. All they to drink was water from a barrel that was
right outside and filled with rainwater, so they filled a couple of
bottles with it. The previous contents of the bottles had vanished
into the ground, but the water still tasted a bit like it.</P><P>“Bear
with it. I know it's gross, but we shouldn't risk dehydration or
hunger,” Olette said, and with a deep sigh, she bit into the nasty
bread.</P><P>“I
would even eat Tifa's curry now...” Naminè said, and drank another
bit of the water.</P><P>“You're
hardcore...” Olette said, quite surprised someone wanted to eat
Tifa's food.</P><P>“I'm
just really hungry,” Naminè said and proceeded to eat some of the
bread.</P><P>“I
already feel much better. I think we can start looking for a boat or
some info on the island tomorrow.”</P><P>Naminè
gave her a nod and continued chewing in silence.</P><P>The
night went by without any further events. Olette and Naminè wasted a
bit of time talking about Hollow Bastion, Aerith and Tifa, and their
training. Both avoided the topic of Kairi on purpose, as they both
believed they would find her.</P><P>The
morning was damp, but the sun had come out. Olette had once more
proven that she was downright a monster and was almost over her
fever.</P><P>“Thank
God you didn't catch a cold or my fever. I would've felt really
irresponsible,” Olette said and for the first time in two days, she
walked around without feeling every muscle in her body ache.</P><P>“Are
you really okay? If you still feel sick, I can start looking for
clues at my own,” Naminé said, which immediately earned a laugh
from Olette.</P><P>“I
would worry about you so much in this dangerous town that I'd
probably get worse by the second.”</P><P>“Meanie,”
Naminè said and started to sulk.</P><P>“Let's
first look for information on the island,” Olette said, and climbed
out of the window.</P><P>They
had agreed on using the window as entrance to prevent people from
noticing that someone was hiding in the storehouse. Olette reached
her hand out to Naminè, pulling her up.</P><P>“We...should
avoid the tavern and the harbor. Two girls like us will probably
catch too much unwanted attention.”</P><P>Olette
remembered the night they had first arrived in the town. The men from
the tavern that almost...if she ever saw those men again, they would
find themselves on the bottom of the harbor.</P><P>“But
whom do we ask?”</P><P>Even
Olette was kinda lost at that. She could go to a tavern alone. Even
if someone assaulted her, if Naminè was safe, she could go wild and
beat them up. The training with Tifa would come in handy. But would
Naminè stay put if she knew Olette was throwing herself into danger?</P><P>“I
want you to stay here, Naminè. People will call you a witch if you
use magic here, and it's really hard for me to protect you against a
whole bunch of people. I'll go and look for some information
and...organize some food.”</P><P>Olette
could feel her heart ache when she told Naminè indirectly that she
was in the way.</P><P>“I
trust you. I'll stay here, but if anything happens, come
back...please.”</P><P>Naminè
seemed honestly worried. Olette gave her a nod and ran off.</P>
