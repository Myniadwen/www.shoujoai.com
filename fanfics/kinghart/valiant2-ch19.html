<h1>Valiant Hearts II (part 19 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kinghart/index.html">Kingdom Hearts</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yuritale.html">Yuritale</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kinghart/valiant2-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><p align='center'><i>Rise of the Shadows -</i></p><p align='center'><i>The Longest 
Day</i></p><p>“Hyaa! Meteordive!” Tifa jumped from a scaffolding and slammed her fist into 
the ground, which simultaneously caused an explosion right around her that inflicted massive 
damage to the fire-spewing Heartless.</p><p>It was time the others caught up. Leon and Kairi 
were holding their own, but they were more suited to combat that only targeted one enemy. 
Not this.</p><p>It was more than just an invasion. Right in the middle of the district was a 
gigantic hole in the ground—the world's barrier to the darkness. Heartless were crawling out 
of it at an alarming rate. Merlin was occupied with holding up the barrier of light they had 
erected over the district to prevent the rest of the town from becoming infested with the 
dark creatures. They needed Aerith and Naminè, who had fallen behind. Their magics could 
cause heavy area damage.</p><p>Tifa was just a few meters away from Leon, who had used 
lightning magic to extend his sword to thrice its length so that he could kill dozens of 
Heartless with each swing. But there was no end to this. Not only was there a legion of 
Heartless, but they were fairly high-grade, too. For each one he killed, two took the first 
one's place. Leon's legs were injured and his left shoulder had taken some damage. Tifa was 
just as bad—both arms, hands, and legs were covered with cuts and scratches, and there were 
two cuts on her left cheek. Tifa was too reckless in fighting, but that was usually okay 
because of Aerith's powerful protection and curative magic. Leon was…well, Leon. He tried 
not to overdo it, but he wasn't as quick as Tifa.</p><p>Kairi had taken the least damage. As 
she took Oathkeeper in both hands, Kairi made a wide jump, landing right behind a batch of 
quick but weak Heartless. She turned instantly around, using the momentum to cut all of them 
into two. They dissolved quickly, but others took their place just as fast.</p><p>“Fira!” 
Kairi shot a series of fireballs right at them, killing them just as they 
appeared.</p><p>The three were in big trouble if reinforcements didn't arrive 
soon.</p><p>“Leon! Kairi! Get away, I'm going wild for a bit!” Tifa yelled as she jumped 
back on the scaffolding and made for a half-finished staircase.</p><p>They had to close the 
hole in the ground, even if they had to destroy a few houses to do it. Tifa was wheezing and 
panting heavily. She had been the first to arrive, being the fastest of them all, and she 
had crashed right into the masses of Heartless. She had taken down a few big ones with 
extreme force, punching right through their bodies. Thank God the Heartless dissolved into 
darkness rather than bleed.</p><p>Leon had already evacuated, knowing well that standing in 
the way when Tifa went crazy was all but suicide. Kairi was following him, having made her 
way onto the rooftops of mostly finished houses, evading the ground that was swarming with 
the evil beasts. Suddenly, a good two hundred feet away, a pillar of light shot up from the 
ground and a immense explosion followed, basically turning everything to dust.</p><p>Aerith 
was there. Naminè must be too. Kairi was worried about her and she changed course, heading 
to the location of the magicians. They were absolutely necessary and much more important 
than single combat fighter types in this situation. Kairi would play the role of protector. 
Even the best wizard wasn't immune to their own magic.</p><p>“Shield!” Aerith shouted, 
erecting a magic barrier right around Naminè's body. The girl was still inexperienced in 
massive fights like these and she was having a hard time, but even Aerith was amazed at 
these numbers. It wasn't normal by any means. The previous Ultima had drained a lot of magic 
power from her, but it had taken hundreds of Heartless with it. As she used the time to 
recover a bit and refresh their protective spells, Aerith had Naminè prepare an Eidolon. 
Usually, she never allowed it, but the situation was grave. If the whole district was 
infested this badly, they had little choice but to completely level it to the 
ground.</p><p>“…<i>and thy power, o Lord of Inferno, grant upon me to destroy who stands 
before me</i>…” Naminè used the exact recitation Aerith had given her. That would prevent 
Ifrit from going out of control and destroying his master with everything else. In the worst 
case, Aerith would counter-summon Shiva, but she hoped it wouldn't come to that. She had to 
keep up her protective magic to prevent them from being fried as well.</p><p>Kairi had 
almost reached the place Aerith and Naminè were holding their ground when the air started to 
feel heavy. She stopped for a second, and looking back, she saw the rooftop of a building 
still under construction was glowing with a bright light.</p><p>“Always over the top…” Kairi 
muttered, and started running as fast as she could. She had to get somewhere safe on the 
ground before Tifa unleashed her power. She was a good deal away, but the shock wave could 
cause some of the buildings to crash down. Kairi was just too familiar with what was coming. 
To make it all worse, Aerith and Naminè seemed to be up to something big as well. Kairi 
would be caught between them.</p><p>It was raw chaos. While Tifa was at the center, 
preparing for a big attack, Kairi was running over the rooftops towards Aerith and Naminè, 
not only to support them but also to warn them of Tifa's attack. All the while, the two 
magicians themselves were about to unleash a huge spell.</p><p>Aerith was prepared to summon 
Shiva in case something happened now. Naminè spoke the last words of the recitation, and in 
the ground, a hole opened up and a stream of fire blew out of it. A horned, fire-breathing 
beast with yellow skin and red fur escaped from the hell of flames, floating in 
mid-air.</p><p>“Destroy them!” Naminè commanded, pointing at the approaching mass of 
darkness. As if to accept her command, Ifrit breathed out a large gush of fire and, raising 
his paws, gained momentum until he finally crashed in the middle of the mass, causing an 
inferno of flames that set the whole area on fire. The Heartless were gone, and half of the 
plaza they were in was burning.</p><p>Kairi was blinded by the sudden brightness of the 
flames but made her way safely down. She landed right behind Aerith, who turned around, her 
staff pointed at Kairi—ready to unleash a powerful spell at any time.</p><p>“Take cover! 
Tifa's doing <i>that!</i>” Kairi warned, but it was too late.</p><p>Everything went silent. 
It was like something was sucking away all noise. Then, the world stopped. It seemed to take 
an eternity, but it happened in seconds. In the center of the district something exploded. 
It was roughly the size of an Ultima explosion. Then the addendum of the act followed. The 
shock wave was so strong that it knocked all three of them over, blowing away the smaller 
Heartless. Tifa had just blown the center of the district to smithereens.</p><p>“I always 
tell her not to use Final Heaven! Last time she almost got herself killed,” Aerith 
complained, standing up. “We've got to save her now.”</p><p>The streets were still swarming 
with Heartless, but they all seemed to be heading towards the cause of the explosion now. 
Kairi knew about the weak points of these battles, and the three of them made fast progress 
to the place of the explosion. At the very center of it was Tifa, bleeding heavily from her 
arms and legs but still fighting the Heartless that were trying to kill her.</p><p>Kairi 
knew what they had to do now. As she took Naminé's hand, she looked around. Heartless were 
streaming in from six different streets to this center. If they could hold this ground, it 
would prove tactically useful. The place where the hole had been was blocked by enormous 
fragments of the buildings that had previously surrounded it. It was like a gigantic crater 
instead of a plaza now. They had to save Tifa and then get out of there.</p><p>“Stay with 
me, Naminè,” Kairi said, and made a horizontal slash right above Naminè's head, cutting 
apart a Heartless. “I will protect you. Aim for the streets. The Heartless concentrate at 
these. Magic will prove extremely useful. Don't use fire, they're resistant. Ifrit worked, 
but weaker magic won't.”</p><p>With a nod, Naminè prepared for several spells of recitation 
magic. If Kairi protected her, she didn't need to rely on instant casting magic. The 
stronger, the better for now.</p><p>Kairi danced around Naminè, slashing the crawling 
Heartless on the ground, cutting away the legs of the bigger ones, finishing them with ice 
magic and beheading them. She would only last so long. They had to end this 
quickly.</p><p>“<i>Pass judgment on those that rebel against order!</i>” Naminè fired a 
lightning bolt right at the entrance of a street, causing the walls to crumble and crash 
down on the Heartless, blocking the way for any more. “<i>Rage of the Divine!</i>” Another 
one missed the critical point this time, only turning dozens of Heartless to 
ash.</p><p>Aerith was holding off any Heartless that targeted Tifa, and there were a lot. 
Using high-grade magic like Icega and Boltga continuously was wearing even her out over 
time.</p><p>“We need to get out of here. No sense wasting our energy fighting these 
Heartless from all sides at once,” Tifa said, kneeling right beside Aerith as she let the 
curative spell do its work. No magic could heal instantaneously, and even Aerith was no 
exception to that.</p><p>Even Kairi was starting to see to see how pointless it was. Sure, 
if they could hold this wide space it would allow them to use vastly destructive attacks on 
spots where the Heartless were concentrated, causing maximum damage with minimum cost. But 
what sense did it make to continuously fight off Heartless if they couldn't seal the source 
of them?</p><p>“Kairi! Aerith! We're retreating from this place. The barrier is still up and 
Merlin will be able to keep it up a bit longer. We need to regroup. I have no idea were Cid 
is and Tifa is in no condition to fight.” Leon had jumped down from a rooftop, right in the 
middle of the space between Kairi's group and Aerith's group. “Get out of here now!” he 
shouted. He and spun around, taking care of a few approaching Heartless.</p><p>Kairi had a 
deep cut on her right cheek and some minor ones on arms and legs, mostly scratches. Only 
Aerith and Naminè were basically uninjured thanks to Aerith's shield magic, but even that 
was only physically. They were exhausted, and if this went on, they would break down 
soon.</p><p>“We're leaving!” Kairi said, dematerializing Oathkeeper and picking up Naminè. 
“Keep Monochrome. If something attacks us, I need you to blast it off. I'll carry you out of 
here—it's the only way. The streets are blocked by the masses of Heartless,” Kairi explained 
while already carrying Naminè as they made their way up to the roof. The ground trembled 
below them, but that was nothing new. Kairi couldn't afford to look what caused it, but it 
was probably Tifa or one of Aerith's major spells.</p><p>The air suddenly froze. That was 
too sudden and severe, even if Aerith had summoned Shiva. Looking back, Kairi's eyes went 
wide in shock. The Heartless, now freely moving through the crater, had started to merge. 
Slowly but surely, a gigantic Darkside giant was rising. It was already towering over the 
buildings that had survived the blasts.</p><p>“Shit, that thing won't even notice Merlin's 
barrier!” Kairi stopped on the roof of a half-collapsed building. “We need to take it out 
right here.” She looked over at Aerith and Tifa, who were on the other side. They seemed to 
have noticed too. Leon was on a high-up balcony in between. He signalized an attack. They 
had to take this thing out. If it got away, the Heartless could spread all over Hollow 
Bastion. “Naminè, can you still fight?”</p><p>“I'm okay,” Naminè answered honestly, and took 
a deep breath. “But I don't think my spells will have much effect on a thing this size…” 
Aerith had taught her well. She knew that it was important to use every opportunity to 
regain some of her magic power in order to lessen the burden on her mind. Having Kairi with 
her helped a great deal, but even so, she wasn't nearly as powerful as Aerith. “What 
<i>is</i> that?”</p><p>Kairi looked at the situation. Leon seemed to be concentrating on 
something. He was strong and had a few special moves of his own, but they all needed some 
preparation time. Aerith seemed to be preparing for something big as well, as did Tifa. They 
were relatively safe on the roofs, but they would have to divert the attention of the 
Darkside to successfully destroy the gate.</p><p>“Naminè, I know you shouldn't use it, but 
try to use a lightning recitation summoning. Aim it at the center of the crater. Just don't 
overdo it. I can't do much from here, I need that thing to go down before I can cause some 
real damage.” Kairi knew that it was asking too much, but they had no choice.</p><p>Naminè 
but nodded, took a deep breath, leaned over, and amidst all the fighting, kissed Kairi. 
“Helps me concentrate,” she said upon seeing Kairi's confused look. “Lightning…” Naminè knew 
three different entities of lighting to call upon. Ramuh was the weakest one, and by the 
size of this thing it probably wasn't enough with her magic potential. Something 
big…</p><p>Kairi started to use Fira spells, shooting at the Darkside. It seemed to have no 
effect other than burning a few Heartless away from its form. Good thing it was still taking 
shape and not completely finished. A Darkside was immensely powerful. Even if they were five 
against one, a single Darkside could multiply their troubles into heights never seen 
before.</p><p>“<i>Beyond the clouds, in thy anger we bathe. Lord of Thunder, Voice of the 
Gods, hear my plea. To destroy those that do not wield thy power is my wish. Grant me thy 
power, o Master of Lighting. Descend, </i><i>Adrammelech</i><i>!</i>”</p><p>Concentrating 
hard and somewhat at ease thanks to Kairi being with her, Naminè finished the summoning. 
Crumbs of stone started to bounce over the ground, and iron bars and girders located towards 
the center of the crater began to groan and bend. Was the spell going out of control? Kairi 
hope it wouldn't, as she was responsible for Naminè casting this.</p><p>Kairi was scared at 
the sight of what happened next. Small electric bolts started to emit from over the Darkside 
that crashed into nearby buildings, ripping holes in massive stone and ground. It seemed 
like an illusion or an image of blurred air, but Kairi could make out a ball of lightning 
floating right over the crater.</p><p>With a howl that went through bone, a lightning bolt 
so massive that it seemed like a beam crashed down from the ball, hitting the Darkside and 
splitting right through it until hitting the ground. The bolt raised a cloud of dust and 
dirt and was followed by an explosion. By the time the dirt cloud vanished, they could see 
the results of their doings. The Darkside was still there. It was only slightly damaged. It 
wasn't that the summoning had been unsuccessful, it was just Naminè not having enough power 
to actually call upon such a powerful being.</p><p>Looking around, Aerith was still 
preparing, but Tifa was missing. Searching for her with wild looks, Kairi spotted her 
jumping over the roofs to the place where Leon was. What was she planning to do? Leon was 
apparently still concentrating. Naminè's spell had slowed down the Darkside, but would it be 
enough time? Tifa passed Leon. Was she heading over <i>here?</i> They had caused the 
summoning of Volt—was she here to scold them? In <i>this</i> situation? Now? That was 
impossible.</p><p>“It's coming!” Naminè shouted, taking cover. A gigantic black claw, easily 
five times the size of an adult, was reaching for them, trying to grab and crush them. Kairi 
had fought one of these things before and she knew that even they felt pain. Making a huge 
jump, Kairi slashed furiously at the fingers of the beast in mid-air. With a brutal stab, 
Kairi plunged Oathkeeper into the top of the claw of the beast, where it stuck.</p><p>The 
beast whined out in pain, taking back its claw with Kairi still attached to it. Taking out 
Oathkeeper, Kairi started to run over the arm of the monster. It was almost as wide as a 
small street. When she reached the shoulder, before the beast could react, Kairi jumped and 
rammed Oathkeeper in the eye of the thing, causing it to bend its back in pain. It furiously 
began to shake its head, and Kairi couldn't keep her grip on Oathkeeper and was thrown 
off.</p><p>Tifa made a huge jump from one of the roofs, grabbing Kairi's arm in mid-air and 
pulling the Keyblader with her. They landed on a broken balcony, and Tifa immediately forced 
Kairi with her by not letting go of her and instead jumping back up to the 
roof.</p><p>“Idiot! What if I hadn't caught you?!” Tifa yelled angrily.</p><p>“I knew you 
would! I calculated your position from your running speed. You were in the perfect position 
to catch me,” Kairi answered, closing her eyes and moving her face away from Tifa. “Come!” 
she suddenly shouted.</p><p>Oathkeeper vanished from the eye of the Darkside that was going 
wild from the pain and appeared in her hand. “What are the others doing?” Kairi asked the 
fighter.</p><p>“Aerith is going with a full force Ultima. It should damage that monstrosity 
a lot. Leon, I don't know, but he could go for <i>that</i>, you know,” Tifa answered, and 
added, “I already used a Final Heaven earlier. I don't have the energy left for another. I 
can go close combat with it when it goes down from the Ultima. I trust you to come with me. 
Naminè can support us from here.” Tifa wasn't dumb either. She had a lot of experience 
fighting and she knew the abilities of everyone well.</p><p>With a quick look around, Kairi 
decided it would be wise to get back to Naminè ASAP, and Tifa followed her. After a big 
jump, Kairi took another quick look around, this time to the ground. It was crawling with 
Heartless. Falling down there meant certain doom.</p><p>“Kairi, are you okay?” Naminè came 
running up to her, worried.</p><p>“Down!” Kairi shouted, unable to answer the magician's 
question. She lay down on the roof, pulling Naminè with her. Since Kairi never gave such 
commands without good reason, Tifa did the same just seconds later. The electricity in the 
air was making the hairs on her neck were standing up, which meant Aerith must've really 
been giving it her all.</p><p>For in the blink of an eye, another roof shimmered with green 
light, and a pillar of the same green light flew towards the Darkside. The pillar went right 
through it, taking half of its upper body and its entire right arm with it. Tifa could see 
Aerith on her knees when the light vanished.</p><p>“I knew Aerith was strong, but that was 
crazy…” Kairi said, looking over to where Aerith was. From the corner of her eye, she 
noticed something else. Leon.</p><p>“<i>Blasting Zone!</i>” Leon yelled, raising his 
gunblade up. Seconds later an energy ray emitted from it, slowly forming a pillar that was 
at least six feet in diameter. As he jumped to a lower level, taking the pillar with him, 
Leon aimed his sword down, which effectively leveled two houses that stood in the way as he 
moved the beam horizontally. Seconds later it cut through the legs of the Darkside, making 
it fall over. Darkness dispersed from the cut-off part, as if it were disintegrating. Leon 
didn't lose any time and pushed forward, jumping onto the cut-off parts, making his way to 
the upper body of the beast.</p><p>“Kairi, now is our chance to take that thing down!” Tifa 
shouted, and when Kairi turned to look she was already gone</p><p>With a dangerous jump, she 
landed right on the ground and made a sprint to where Leon was, reaching the upper parts 
even before him. Another powerful jump later, Tifa was face-to-face with the monster and 
violently ramming her fist in the wound Kairi had caused earlier. Leon, meanwhile, was 
hacking away at the deadly wound the Ultima had left.</p><p>Kairi was the last to arrive, 
but her attacks had the biggest effect since a Keyblade was essentially an anti-Heartless 
weapon. Ramming Oathkeeper into the body of the Darkside, Kairi slowly made her way up. The 
Heartless on the ground were assembling, trying to repair the damage caused by the group, 
but they weren't fast enough.</p><p>Kairi finally reached the upper part of the Darkside 
where Leon was. They would need to unleash one fatal attack to kill this thing, and Kairi 
already knew how.</p><p>“Tifa!” Kairi shouted, and the fighter left her position to join 
Kairi. “Throw me. I'll finish this!”</p><p>Without complaint, Tifa stretched out her arm, 
standing before Kairi. The redhead jumped on her arm and Tifa instantly started to spin. 
With a powerful swing, she shot Kairi up in the air high enough so that she was just on par 
with the head of the Darkside. It was time to finish this.</p><p>Using an attack she had 
named “Cascade” Kairi threw Oathkeeper right at the head of the Darkside. It completely 
submerged in the darkness. Still rising, Kairi closed her eyes and imagined her Keyblade 
while putting both hands to her heart. When she opened her eyes, she stretched out her right 
arm, grabbing air, holding nothing.</p><p>Starting to make seemingly wild and senseless 
moves, the Darkside started to run amok. In an extreme frenzy, it started to hit everything 
in its way. Tifa tried to get away but got hit. She crashed into a nearby building, walls 
collapsing behind her. Leon was forced to withdraw.</p><p>Kairi landed on the ground, 
gritting her teeth from the pain of the impact. But she had to swallow the urge to yell out 
and give in to the pain and start to run, to get away.</p><p>The Darkside was collapsing, 
releasing countless Heartless as it started to break into parts. It was time to get out of 
there. Kairi managed to get to where Tifa was. The black-haired woman was bleeding heavily 
but managed to stand on her own. When she looked up, Kairi spotted Aerith who had Naminè 
with her. Seeing her made Kairi let her guard down for a second, and suddenly a few 
Heartless that had approached were attacking them, leaving no time to block or 
counterattack. Trying to get away, Kairi's legs gave in to pain and she stumbled. But in the 
brink of an eye, a massive blade crushed the Heartless, saving both Tifa and 
Kairi.</p><p>“Cloud! What are you doing here?” Tifa was amazed. The eccentric man wasn't 
known to care about this world or anything at all if it wasn't related to Sephiroth. Kairi 
used the chance to stand up and take a breather. Cloud was a formidable fighter. Stronger 
than Leon but more of a brute and less of a tactician, he was more than an equal match to 
their leader.</p><p>“If this world falls to the darkness, I will be back to nothing on my 
search for Sephiroth. I know he is in this world somewhere. I will not watch it vanish,” 
Cloud said, violently crushing a few approaching Heartless. “Get out of here. You're in the 
way.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Kairi said, despite his rough comment, and started to run away with 
Tifa.</p><p>“We're regrouping at a point right outside the barrier, next to Marle's Garage. 
Don't get yourself killed, Cloud!” Tifa shouted as they left the guy with the blond spiky 
hair behind them.</p><p>Upon Kairi's funny look, Tifa sighed. “I don't care about him like 
that. But he is still an old friend. I don't want him to die or become a Heartless,” she 
explained, and started to run faster. Kairi didn't ask any more questions, also to preserve 
her breath. There were unusually few Heartless on the streets now, and it was a welcome 
gift, as they didn't have the energy to make it up to the roofs.</p><p>The ground suddenly 
shook violently, and both Kairi and Tifa hit the ground, unprepared for a quake of that 
magnitude. Looking back, Kairi went pale. Another Darkside was towering over the crushed 
buildings, trying to catch something in the air.</p><p>“Cloud is fighting it all alone,” 
Tifa said. With a flash of light, one of the arms of the Darkside was cut off, making the 
monster cry out in rage. Another quake. It seemed the monster was stomping on something. 
“That must be Leon.”</p><p>“Leave this to them, they're going to—” Kairi stopped. In the 
midst of all this chaos, Cid ran past her, carrying a lance and a bag. “We need to get out 
of here now,” she concluded. If Cid was involved, things always went straight to hell. And 
to make it worse, he could actually go all out here. Kairi was hoping he wouldn't blow up 
the entire district. He really had a fetish for dynamite and these things.</p><p>Without 
further comment, they made it out of the district. Passing the barrier was no problem. Since 
it made them feel a bit numb, it helped to actually lessened the pain they were feeling. 
Aerith and Naminè were already waiting for them.</p><p>“Kairi! Are you okay?” Naminè started 
running towards the other Keyblader as soon as she saw her. Hugging her on reflex, Kairi had 
to grit her teeth from the pain. “I'm sorry! I'll heal you right away. Aerith is busy 
healing Tifa, so I'll do it.” Naminè led Kairi to a bench and had her sit down.</p><p>It was 
obvious how tired Naminè was. She was pale and sweating, even though it was cold. How long 
had this attack been going on? The sun was already rising on the the horizon. Would they win 
this battle? There seemed no end to the Heartless.</p><p>Naminè used a curative spell on 
Kairi. The pain rose up as injuries were forcefully closed and made Kairi almost pass out. 
Naminè's magic was much rougher than usual, but that was to be expected. She had been using 
it for almost two hours now.</p><p>“I'm sorry, but this is all I can do…” Naminè apologized 
and took a deep breath, holding her forehead. It was the worst she had ever felt. Not even 
when she had misused Celsius had she felt this bad. Was this the same sort of battles Kairi 
had been through in the past? Naminè finally started to understand a little why she had 
trained so hard. It was a war they could only win if every one of them gave it their 
best.</p><p>“Don't worry, you did fine,” Kairi said, and pulled Naminè close. The battle was 
still going on. Every now and then, they could hear explosions and the angry growl of the 
Darkside Cloud and Leon were fighting against. Everyone was doing everything they could. But 
who was leading these Heartless? Who had cut a hole in the barrier of the world? Who had the 
power to do that? Kairi could only think of Ansem, but he was dead. So who…?</p><p>“Can I 
lean onto you for a bit?” Naminè asked, not sure if it was okay because Kairi was hurt. “I 
want to close my eyes just for a moment…” the magician said, and looked on the ground. 
Before she knew it, Kairi had pulled her over and forced her to lie down on her 
lap.</p><p>“Sure. My shoulder hurts, but this is fine. Try to rest a bit.” Kairi was too 
tired to be embarrassed about this. She knew it was the best for Naminè to rest as much as 
possible. Aerith, too, was leaning back on Tifa as they sat on the ground. She was 
apparently asleep, or at least looking like it.</p><p>“Close your eyes. I'll watch out for 
you,” Kairi said as nicely as she could. Her shoulder still hurt, and the curative magic 
made it a lot worse. Faster regeneration didn't mean less pain. It was the opposite. The 
stronger the healing magic, the stronger the pain that came with it. But it was a necessary 
thing in times like these.</p><p align='center'>---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>“Hey hey hey!” 
Cid shouted, piercing the approaching black hand of the Darkside. It was a lost battle 
without a Keyblader, but both of them were too tired or injured to fight right now. Cid, 
Cloud, and Leon had to destroy this thing without their help, but it seemed to regenerate 
just as fast as they caused damage. Without summoning magic or some extreme attacks, they 
just didn't have enough power. Cid was busy running around the Darkside, placing something 
here, something there, preparing for something big.</p><p>“This thing is through,” Cloud 
said to Leon. Both of them were standing back to back, surrounded by Heartless that had 
spawned off the Darkside. Leon was exhausted, but Cloud still had some energy left in 
him.</p><p>“You can go home if you want, old man!” Cloud mocked Leon and made a push right 
in the rows of the Heartless, ferociously crushing, slaying everything that approached him, 
touched him.</p><p>He had tasted the power of the Heartless. He had once made a pact with 
Hades, and some of the darkness still remained inside him. He knew no fear, not anymore. 
These were just weaklings. But even so, they were infinite in their numbers, steadily 
spawning more. What in the world was Cid doing? He had asked them to hold out for a while, 
to keep this monster busy, but what in the world…?</p><p>“It's coming, and you're going to 
regret the 'old man'!” Leon shouted. He made a run for it, used a nearby wall fragment that 
had fallen down to catapult himself on top of the giant's hand, and hacking away on its 
fingers, causing the massive Heartless to withdraw its arm. While Leon was still on top of 
it, he concentrated for a second and used the same lightning magic as before to enlarge his 
sword. With a powerful jump and an even more powerful stab, he rammed his sword to the hilt 
into the chest of the Heartless. “<i>Now!</i>”</p><p>Cloud was standing on a roof, waiting 
for the right moment to strike. Cloud now unleashed a series of rays from his sword, all of 
them hitting on the same height Leon was on but on the other side of the wide chest of the 
Darkside. It was too much for the Heartless and it lost its balance, falling down. Once it 
crashed down on the ground. Leon immediately withdrew. Whatever Cid had planned, it was now 
his turn. Cloud took shelter behind a pile of iron bars, while Leon hid behind a wall 
fragment on the ground. Cid pulled a trigger from his pocket and looked at the Darkside. It 
was in a perfect position.</p><p>“Go to hell!” Cid yelled, and pushed the button, before 
immediately jumping and hiding behind a large piece of steel.</p><p>First came the 
explosion, powerful enough to turn everything in the at least two-hundred-foot crater to 
ash, then the shock wave, which shook ground and everything else alike. When the enormous 
dust cloud vanished, the crater had gained even more depth. It was easily twenty feet deep 
now, and the ground was still burning. Some of the buildings nearby had been turned to dust, 
leveled to the ground. The main problem was still at hand. The hole in the world's barrier 
was still there. Kairi and Naminè needed to lock that, but would they be able to? It wasn't 
just any Keyhole.</p><p>“Retreat!” Leon shouted. He had several burns on his arms, legs and 
face, but he managed to keep running. Cloud managed to burst out from the couple of rocks he 
had been buried under, amazingly following Leon's order. Even he had his limits, and this 
never-ending fight was just stupid to continue. Cid had been running long before Leon 
ordered to retreat.</p><p>The Heartless would take some time to build the next Darkside. It 
was apparently their clear intent to do so. They were already gathering in the very same 
spot. It was kind of unnatural, though, as usually the Heartless didn't tactically aim for 
such things. They were too primitive for this. Someone had to be pulling the strings in the 
shadows. But who had the power to do this?</p><p align='center'>---Valiant 
Hearts---</p><p>“The barrier still stands, and thanks to Cid's machine, whatever it's 
called…”</p><p>“It's the MAM, Magic Amplifier Module, you…” Cid interrupted Leon and patted 
his machine. It allowed Merlin to use just a minimum amount of magic to achieve the same 
result as before. This way they could keep the barrier up for extended periods of 
time.</p><p>“Yes, whatever. Thanks to this thing, we can plan our next attack. The Heartless 
will probably need some more time to form another Darkside, but we can't afford to sit 
around for too long.”</p><p>Leon continued his speech. Everyone was exhausted and resting in 
front of the barrier. They had been supplied with food from Maria, who worked for a bakery. 
The sun was up by now, which meant more than four hours had passed since the alarm. The 
whole town was in a state of emergency, but it was under control, thanks to Merlin and Cid 
and the ones that destroyed the two Darksides.</p><p>“We need to seal that hellhole. Despite 
whatever caused it, Kairi and Naminè should be able to close it. A Keyblade can close and 
open any lock. I believe it will work.” Tifa spoke up, trying to stand, but Aerith pulled 
her back down. She wasn't allowed to walk around for now. They had to use every moment to 
rest so they would be be in as good a shape as possible.</p><p>“I was thinking the same,” 
Leon said. “We're in deep trouble if we can't close it. I really wish Olette and Yuffie were 
here. They would be really helpful right now. But there's no use whining about it. We'll 
split into two teams. Cloud, Cid, Tifa, and I will form one team. Kairi, Naminè, and Aerith 
will form another. Aerith, it's your job to ensure they get through. We will open a path for 
you, and if there is a Darkside, we will take it down, or at least keep it busy until you 
seal the portal. That's all,” Leon told everyone.</p><p>Nobody complained, not even Cloud. 
Amazingly, he was still present, silently chewing some bread in a corner as he leaned on his 
sword that he had rammed into the ground.</p><p>Aerith and Tifa were still where they had 
been the last hour, leaning back on back on the ground. It was pretty obvious that Tifa had 
the same effect on Aerith as Kairi had on Naminè. Kairi could only guess how complicated the 
mind of a pure spellcaster was, but having their loved ones right next to them probably put 
them at emotional ease.</p><p>Naminè was sleeping on Kairi's lap, and it was good that way. 
Kairi would wake her up some time before they attacked. She would need to eat 
something.</p><p>Cid was doing some maintenance on the machine. It would allow Merlin to 
take a break. He had been holding up the barrier for the entire time now. Countless 
Heartless were crawling near the borders, trying to escape, but it was 
pointless.</p><p>Nobody was in good shape except Cid, but he had been up for far over 
twenty-four hours now. He could screw up. Leon did trust him, but it was a risk, one he had 
to take. Leon himself was sitting down, his back to a wall, watching.</p><p>Tifa was pretty 
bad—injured all over the place. Aerith's curative magic was strong, but even so, it was only 
accelerating the process. No instantaneous healing. Kairi was only slightly injured and 
given the situation, in pretty good condition. Naminè would probably be fine after taking a 
nap.</p><p>Aerith, however, seemed beyond exhausted. She wasn't in any condition to fight. 
Leon had put her into Kairi's team so she only had to protect them from random Heartless, 
not fight the big mobs. Cloud…well, he didn't seem too bad, but who knew what was up with 
him. Leon didn't especially care for his well-being.</p><p>Beyond just stopping this attack 
was the question of where it had come from and what to do to prevent this from happening 
again. Just from the look of it, the Heartless were locals to the world of Agrabah, but for 
the past year, there had been no sign of any major Heartless showing up. And disrupting and 
breaking a world's barrier was no small feat. Something big was behind this.</p><p>Leon made 
his way over to where Kairi was sitting with Naminè on her lap. “I need to speak to you. 
It's about this attack.”</p><p>It was an order. He would question, she would answer. Kairi 
was a Keyblader, but Leon was the one making the decisions. “These are clearly locals to 
Agrabah from what info we have from the past. Can you think of anyone having the power to do 
this?”</p><p>Kairi sighed. She knew someone who could do that. “A wizard named Jafar. He 
became a genie through the power of another genie. I sealed him in his lamp and hid it in 
ruins far outside the town. Nobody could have found it. Even so, Aladdin, a local guy that 
helped me out back there, promised to check on the hideout from time to time.” It was pretty 
obvious from this that Jafar had been freed. Nobody but an almost almighty genie could open 
a hole in a world's barrier towards the darkness.</p><p>“How are we going to deal with a 
genie? It'll be difficult to seal him into his lamp again. And from what I know, a genie is 
a multitude stronger than anything we know, including Eidolons. I will need more details 
after this. Try to rest for now. I need you in top condition,” Leon concluded, and walked 
back to his spot. “A genie. I will need to ask Merlin about this later.” Closing his eyes 
and laying a hand on his forehead, he got lost in his thoughts.</p><p>“Wake up. Naminè. Wake 
up.” Kairi was gently shaking the blond girl, trying to wake her up. She had to eat 
something before their next attack began. There was no telling when the next Darkside was 
ready, and no barrier of this world could hold a Heartless of that format. They had to 
hurry.</p><p>“What…!” Naminè was wide awake. She suddenly remembered what was happening, and 
only now noticed that she had fallen asleep.</p><p>Kairi handed her some bread and water. 
Even Naminè understood that this wasn't the time to fool around, and that they needed to 
concentrate on what they had to do. Taking the food, she spent the next few minutes chewing 
and collecting her thoughts. She felt much better than before the break, but she still 
wasn't top condition. And the inside of the barrier seemed worse than ever. The border of 
the barrier was a black mass with eyes and antennas. Terrifying.</p><p>“Listen!” Leon made 
his next move. “We will lower the power of the barrier on the borders. That'll make the 
Heartless try to escape. We have placed numerous members of the town militia around the 
district. They will fight and destroy whatever escapes. We need to decimate their numbers 
before we attempt to clear a path, and this is the only way without making it a suicide 
mission. I don't like it, but we don't have any other choice. We will commence our attack 
five minutes after we lower the barrier, so keep yourself on stand-by. Form your teams. I 
don't want to see any causalities.”</p><p>Kairi was always amazed when she heard Leon like 
this. His experience seemed to be from real battles. He came up with the plan of using the 
militia to decimate the Heartless that had amassed on the barrier's border and also had 
personally placed each single one of them. There were eight people on the small area where 
the Keyblader group had rested. Kairi only knew four of them. The other four were unknown 
faces to her. With three women and five men, it was a close match-up of magician and 
defender.</p><p>“Commence!” Leon shouted, and the message was relayed by others. The attack 
begun. The barrier's light-blue field lost considerable power, and countless Heartless 
started flowing out of it. The militia engaged them at once, firing bolts of magic and 
projectiles at the burn points where the Heartless density was extremely high. Kairi had to 
suppress the urge to go and help them.</p><p>She had another job to do. Each minute seemed 
to take an eternity to pass. More than often, the Heartless reached the militia members, and 
the defender had to protect the magician. It was already a fierce battle. They had to put an 
end to this before too many got hurt or died. There were no causalities yet, but given the 
numbers of the enemy, and the little experience the militia had, it was only a question of 
time.</p><p>Kairi watched Leon closely, waiting for the signal, and it eventually came. 
Summoning Oathkeeper and Monochrome, both girls joined Aerith and started to run. Cid was in 
front, throwing explosives to all sides. The district was already a mess, so nobody even 
cared anymore. The Heartless suffered massive causalities, and everything that took the 
place of its predecessor was eliminated by Leon, Cloud, and Tifa. Kairi felt horrible for 
just running after them, barely fighting. But she and Naminè were the only ones capable of 
closing the portal to darkness.</p><p>Slamming her fist in a nearby wall, Tifa smashed the 
outer wall of an half-collapsed building, which crushed hundreds of Heartless that were 
swarming below and inside the wreck.</p><p>“There's no end to this!” Tifa yelled, and took a 
quick look around. Heartless were closing in from all sides, even though a lot of them were 
leaving the barrier continuously. The Keyblade must be the cause for that.</p><p>“Keep 
going!” Leon ordered, and cut apart a mass of darkness right on front of him. He ignored his 
injuries, as so did everyone else. They had to make it through or else they would never make 
it at all. If they had to wait again, the Heartless would become too many to beat. Now was 
their only chance to save Hollow Bastion.</p><p>Behind them was a massive mass of Heartless 
approaching. “Blizzaga!” Aerith was at her limit. While Leon and Cloud freed the way up 
ahead, Tifa and Cid were responsible for their flanks. Their back was totally open, and they 
were moving more slowly than they had intended. The situation was becoming worse every 
second. Aerith cast another spell of Blizzaga magic, destroying vast quantities of 
Heartless. Weren't they at the center yet?</p><p>More trouble was coming—unexpected trouble. 
Right in front of them a Darkside stepped in their path, blocking their way. Going around 
was suicide. They didn't even know which streets were still intact.</p><p>“Tifa, Keep going, 
Cloud, Cid and I will keep this one busy. You have to make it to the center. Go!” Leon 
yelled, using magic on his sword almost instantaneously and rushing towards the Darkside 
together with Cloud to cut apart its legs.</p><p>Cid was throwing explosives like a madman, 
and Leon had to withdraw for a moment when the Darkside got engulfed in a explosion. The 
shock wave of the dynamite almost knocked Naminè over, forcing Kairi to hold 
her.</p><p>“Come on!” Kairi didn't waste any time, nor did Tifa. Aerith was doing her best 
to keep their protection spells up, but she was worried about Leon, Cloud, and Cid. Would 
they stand against a Darkside? They had to. Even if they closed the gate, the Heartless 
wouldn't just vanish. They still had to exterminate every single one of them. It didn't seem 
like work they could finish.</p><p>Tifa was exhausted, wheezing and bleeding from several 
cuts and scratches. Her legs didn't want to carry her much further, but she forced herself 
to go on. It was a continuous fight. There was no break, she had literally to smash through 
waves of Heartless. But finally, there it was, the corner towards the 
center.</p><p>Buildings were towering to both sides, so they couldn't see how bad the 
situation was. A Keyblade could work from a distance, so the roofs were a safer place to 
be.</p><p>“Jump!” Tifa stretched out her arms. Naminè wasn't sure about this, but Kairi 
already followed Tifa's order and she too, jumped on Tifa's arm. The force of motion was so 
strong that she almost passed out when Tifa acted as catapult and shot them on top of the 
building. “Now it's up to them.”</p><p>Kairi was as pale as paper. The center of the 
district wasn't even a place of this world anymore. Two…three Darksides were just waiting 
for them. It was hopeless to take the time to close the portal if they were attacked by 
three of these giants at once. The first one had already noticed them—noticed the Keyblade. 
His black paw was reaching for the girls when something hit it. A massive energy beam flew 
right through it, impacting the Darkside behind, and the following explosion caused Kairi to 
take cover with Naminè.</p><p>“That was an Ultima, wasn't it?” Naminé asked. Aerith couldn't 
possibly have the power to cast another after all of this. What was she doing? Kairi nodded 
and looked around. It was their chance. The third Darkside was confused and the other two 
were on the ground, regenerating.</p><p>“Listen. Concentrate on the hole. Imagine it is a 
lock that snapped open. We need to close it. Monochrome was my Keyblade before, so we should 
be at least a bit synchronous. Now!” Kairi directed Oathkeeper at the huge black hole in the 
ground.</p><p>For seconds, nothing happened. She held it back. Monochrome joined Oathkeeper 
seconds later, and two rays of light shot through the darkness, impacting the gate. Closing 
a gate forcefully was extremely painful, Kairi knew that from the past. Holding Naminè 
tightly, she pulled her so close that they were standing as a unit. “Endure it!” Kairi 
pressed out between gritted teeth.</p><p>Slowly but surely, the portal was closing. But they 
weren't fast enough. The Darkside closest to them had finished regenerating and was about to 
attack them. If they canceled out now, they were done for. They wouldn't get another 
chance.</p><p>“Dammit!” Kairi yelled, closing her eyes. Something crashed, and the ground 
shook. But there was no pain. Opening her eyes, Kairi couldn't believe it. “Tifa!”</p><p>It 
was almost breaking her legs, and her arms were about to give in. She could only hold this 
for a while longer. She was past her limit. The pain of bones slowly breaking apart almost 
made her pass out. But she had to withstand it. Aerith was right behind her, kneeling on the 
ground, spitting blood. She had ignored her body's warnings and had used another Ultima. Her 
face was distorted in pain and Tifa seemed no better.</p><p>“Hurry!” she yelled, holding 
back the giant paw of the Darkside. The other paw was coming, and it would undeniably crush 
them if they didn't get away first.</p><p>Something hit the Darkside; its left arm fell to 
the ground. Amidst the darkness was Cloud, going completely out of control. As he slashing 
uncontrollably at anything and everything, the massive Heartless took massive damage. 
Another Darkside, the other one that had gotten caught up in the Ultima, was approaching. 
Just a little more. A little more time!</p><p>“Circle of Fates!” Leon was standing on the 
ground, surrounded by Heartless, creating a wave of fire and destruction that was burning 
away the legs of the second Darkside. It fell to the ground yet again, too wounded to get 
up. Heartless were jumping on him from all sides, and there was barely enough time to take 
care of whatever attacked him before two of its kind took it's place. He had to escape to 
higher ground.</p><p>The gate had shrunk considerably in size. It was a matter of seconds 
until it was closed. Blood was running from both Kairi's and Naminè's arms and foreheads. 
The pain was literally overwhelming. Kairi had a bad feeling and looked behind for a second. 
From their back, three more Darksides were approaching.</p><p>This was the end. Even if they 
finished this, there was no way left to escape. Surrounded by Heartless from all sides, 
exhausted and injured, no one had enough energy left to make their way back out.</p><p>With 
a hissing sound, the gate closed, and Kairi fell face first on the ground. Naminè sunk on 
her knees, unable to stand up. The situation was hopeless. How would they get out of this? 
Was this the end? Had they survived up until now just to be destroyed in a invasion of the 
Heartless? No. No! There was a way after all! Kairi remembered something important.</p><p>A 
Keyblade could open and close any lock.</p><p>Standing up, her whole body shaking and 
trembling, Kairi looked at Naminè. “Help me!”</p><p>Naminè blindly followed her command, 
managing to stand up, and waited for further instructions.</p><p>“Cross Monochrome with 
Oathkeeper. This place is more of a hoard of darkness than in our world. We should be able 
to open a gateway here.” With a nod, Naminè crossed her Keyblade in midair with Kairi's, 
waiting for something to happen.</p><p>Leon had reached higher ground, the roof next to the 
one Kairi and the others were on. They had to get out of here, but even he lacked a plan. He 
hadn't thought that it would be this severe to just close the gate, that the number of 
Heartless was this huge. It was his failure to have miscalculated this badly. He needed to 
get at least Kairi and Naminè to safety. They were the Keybladers. As he jumped over to the 
other roof, he saw the incredible.</p><p>In front of Kairi and Naminè had opened up a small 
portal, barely half the size of a normal one. It was big enough to get a human through, and 
it was their only chance. Thank God it was ground level. Pulling Aerith with her, Kairi 
managed to enter the portal. Naminè followed her inside.</p><p>“Tifa!” Kairi shouted. The 
fighter was down on her knees, unable to hold the giant paw any longer. It would crush her 
any second. In the second her arms gave in, something violently pulled on her left arm 
causing an intense wave of pain.</p><p>Leon had just made it past her and had pulled her 
with him, most likely breaking her arm. With a desperate jump, they made it into the 
portal.</p><p>“Where are Cid and Cloud?!” Kairi yelled.</p><p>“Cid escaped when he ran out 
of explosives earlier. Cloud…he won't come. Close the portal.” Leon was heavily injured. 
They weren't out of danger yet. As long as the portal was open, the Heartless could follow 
them.</p><p>“Fira!” Directing his gunblade out of the portal, Leon shot a fireball right 
upwards. It exploded a good thirty feet over the barrier, clearly visible for everyone in 
the area. “They will raise the barrier again. We need to get out of here, <i>now!</i>” Leon 
commanded.</p><p>Kairi directed Oathkeeper at the portal and closed it just seconds before 
the first Darkside crushed the entire building they had been standing on.</p><p>The path was 
icy, but it was a welcome difference from the cold of the battle with the Heartless. “The 
barrier won't hold the Darksides. No one can take them on now. We need to torch the entire 
place. Thank God the district was still under construction…” Leon said, lying on his 
back.</p><p>“We need…to get out of here…” Kairi pressed out. She felt sick. Locking such a 
huge gate both put a great deal mental and physical pain on a Keyblader. “Naminè, are 
you…no, you can't be okay. How are you feeling, can you stand?” Kairi managed to walk over 
to Naminè. Just as she reached the blond girl, the magician started to crawl to the edge of 
the path to vomit. Kneeling right beside her, Kairi petted her head.</p><p>Aerith had fallen 
unconscious on the rooftop after she had spat blood a few times. She would be bound in bed 
for some time. Tifa was lying on her back, trembling with pain. Her left leg was clearly 
broken. Taking a long strap of leather from her top, she tried to fix it up at least a bit. 
She had lost most of her feeling in her arms, but they didn't seem to be broken.</p><p>“You 
all did well…but Kairi is right, we need to get out of here.” Leon stood up, unstable on his 
own legs and still bleeding from countless wounds. He needed medical attention right away. 
“Kairi, can you help Naminè? Tifa, I will carry Aerith. You can lean on me.” Leon picked up 
the pink-clad woman and groaned in pain. Tifa declined Leon's offer and instead borrowed 
Kairi's Keyblade. Kairi had to concentrate only a little to keep it in its shape even in the 
hands of someone else. But using Oathkeeper as crutch…</p><p>Kairi carried Naminè on her 
back. After vomiting and spitting some blood, Naminè had passed out. It was the first time 
she had to do something like this. Kairi was more used to the physical pain so it was not 
surprising Naminè reacted the way she did. “It would've been easier if Olette had been 
here…” Kairi uttered. “I would be even grateful for Yuffie to be here now.”</p><p>Kairi 
sighed. It made her remember what happened before. She still didn't want to lose 
Olette.</p><p align='center'>---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>When the gate near the canyon 
opened, several people were waiting for them. Everyone was given immediate medical 
treatment, and Tifa was taken away to the hospital. Aerith was being checked by Rydia, who 
was the most potent magician in the healing arts in Hollow Bastion after Aerith. The 
magician seemed okay, but Rydia said that she would be unable to use any magic for a while. 
A little more, and the strain on her body would've caused permanent damage.</p><p>Kairi and 
Naminè received first aid and Naminè was also checked by Rydia but there was no permanent 
damage. Happy to hear it, Kairi held on to the blond girl, placing her head on her lap, and 
finally letting go of her battle mood. She had taken more damage than Naminè, but she felt 
at ease that the magician was out of danger.</p><p>It was the same with Tifa and Aerith. 
Opening her eyes for just a little bit, Naminè reached out her hands to Kairi's face, trying 
to say something. The taste of vomit and blood still in her mouth, Naminè was thankful for 
the water bottle Kairi handed her. She took a big gulp, then coughed up most of it and spat 
it on the ground.</p><p>“Thanks…” Naminè said, and closed her eyes again.</p><p>Leon had 
lost a lot of blood, but after he had received first aid, he seemed to be mostly fine. He 
wouldn't be able to fight for the next hours, though. But he was needed. They had to decide 
what to do about the district infested with Heartless. The Darksides had been sighted slowly 
making their way to the border, destroying everything in their way. There were eight in 
total.</p><p>“Torch the whole place. Burn it to the ground. Tell Cid he has authorization to 
use whatever he wants. I give him level three administration for this operation,” Leon said 
to a guy with a massive red hairdo who slowly walked away to where Cid was 
resting.</p><p>Walking over to Kairi, he sat down on the wall next to them. “This whole 
mess…I can only conclude this genie guy is behind it. Once Olette is back and you two have 
recovered, we're sending you to Agrabah. Yuffie will come with you. She is the only one of 
us who isn't injured and she will be useful. If his influence has already reached this far, 
we won't have to worry about the noise one non-Keyblader will cause to another 
world.”</p><p>Without waiting for an answer, Leon left, slowly walking towards a bigger tent 
that served as center of command right now.</p><p align='center'>---Valiant 
Hearts---</p><p>Over an hour later, Naminè finally came to when she felt the sensation of 
water running over her body. Opening her eyes, she found herself sitting in the bathtub, 
naked, being showered by Kairi, who was being kind of clumsy with her eyes closed. “What are 
you doing?” Naminé blurted out.</p><p>Kairi stopped in her motions and waited for a second. 
“I already showered and I didn't want you to sleep like this. You were covered with blood 
and sweat. And, well…”</p><p>It made Naminé remember the excruciating pain when closing the 
gate of darkness. “Thanks.” Taking the shower head from Kairi, Naminé finished what the 
redhead had begun.</p><p>Kairi waited for another moment and then left. “A towel is hanging 
on the edge.”</p><p>After closing the door of the bathroom, Kairi sank to the ground. She 
felt exhausted, much more so than she had the day before. It had been a long night and 
morning. She could still hear bombs and explosives impacting and exploding in the district 
that was quite a bit away from her house. Cid was doing his job properly. More than eighty 
prefects of the district had been turned to nothing but ash and rubble. Once they finished 
the bombardment, a militia troop would take care of the rest.</p><p>Everyone was licking 
their wounds. The militia had done their best, but there had been a few causalities but 
thankfully no fatalities. Thanks to everyone, they had somehow overcome this crisis. But if 
this really was Jafar's doing…there would be no end to this until they were all dead. His 
thirst for vengeance must be burning hot. They had been lucky this time, but what if the 
next attack started in the middle of the civilian district? Or the industrial district? 
There would be countless innocent victims.</p><p>Even though Naminè was right there, in the 
room behind her, Kairi missed Olette. She would've been a great help and she also missed her 
as friend. Would they ever get along again? Or would things stay this way now? “Olette…” 
Resting her head on her knees, waiting for Naminè to finish bathing, Kairi fell deep in 
thought.</p><p>Not so long ago, Olette had confessed to her and she had turned her down. 
Shortly after, she was starting to fall for Naminè. If Olette had taken the same stance 
Naminè did, would've things have been different?</p><p>“At least today would've been 
different…” Kairi whispered to herself and looked up.</p><p>Inside the room, Naminè was 
hissing in pain from the hot water. She had several cuts and scratches, mostly from the 
reckless act of closing the portal of darkness forcefully. All of this had given her a good 
idea of how hard this life must've been for Kairi. From what Naminè knew, before Olette and 
she arrived, Kairi had shouldered this harsh role alone. The others could only help so much. 
They weren't Keybladers. If this was how a Keyblader lived, Naminè was a bit scared of going 
on like this. Kairi almost died once, and now they only had narrowly escaped certain doom. 
Did she really want to carry on like this?</p><p>“What am I thinking…?” Naminè shook her 
head to make these thoughts go away. She loved Kairi and would never leave her. Even if it 
meant to continuing to expose herself to danger like today. It wasn't much of a choice for 
her. Naminè would not leave Kairi.</p><p align='center'>---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>“You 
can't expect me to stay in the hospital if Aerith is in that condition, Rydia.”</p><p>Tifa 
had received treatment in the hospital and she was walking on crutches, but she wouldn't lie 
down. Aerith had been brought home because she had no physical injuries, and no hospital 
could help with the mental exhaustion of a magician.</p><p>“Don't try to stop me, please.” 
Tifa looked at the ground. The green-haired magician was supposed to look after the two 
Keybladers and Aerith for the next few days, and thinking Tifa would probably cause a ruckus 
if she declined, Rydia let Tifa pass. “Thanks.”</p><p>The pain was making her grit her 
teeth. Her leg had only been put in plaster and it was really exhausting to even walk. But 
she wanted to see Aerith, to check if she was okay. She blamed herself for letting the 
magician go too far. If she hadn't been so reckless, Aerith wouldn't have needed to use a 
powerful spell to heal her.</p><p>Finally reaching the upper floor of her house, Tifa found 
Kairi sitting on the ground, next to the bathroom door. She could hear water 
rushing.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Tifa asked. There was an awkward moment of silence until 
Kairi nodded. Everyone knew that they weren't okay. They had seen death and everyone had 
gone past their limits. Some had taken worse damage than others, but they all were pretty 
down.</p><p>“How is Naminè? That's her in the bath, right?” Tifa knew that it couldn't be 
Aerith, but she couldn't resist getting her hope a little bit up.</p><p>“I think she is 
fine. She took it pretty hard, though, just like I did the first time around.” Kairi was 
just starting to understand now what Naminè must be feeling. Kairi remembered that time when 
she wanted to throw all of this away, run away, stop being a Keyblader. She had almost died 
back then when she had forcefully closed the portal in Neverland. Naminè must be going 
through the same right now.</p><p>“Tifa…are you all right? You look…really bad.” Kairi knew 
Tifa pretty well by now. She had always liked Aerith more, but she knew the fighter well 
enough to know that she was blaming herself for what happened to Aerith. “It's not your 
fault. If not for Aerith's magic, we would be all dead now. And I have to thank you, too. If 
you hadn't stopped the Darkside…”</p><p>Kairi stopped. They both knew that there had been no 
other way in that situation. The Keyblade was not almighty, nor were they. No matter how 
strong one is, if one is alone against an army, one will lose. “We left Cloud back there. I 
wonder what happened to him…” Kairi added.</p><p>“He'll be fine. He's pulled through worse, 
believe me,” Tifa said, and took a deep breath as she faced the door that led to the bedroom 
she shared with Aerith. She opened the door and stepped half inside, where she stopped for a 
moment. “Stay with Naminè. Nobody wants to be alone, least of all after something like 
this.” Tifa closed the door behind her and walked over to the bed. Aerith was lying on it, 
still fully dressed with dirt and bloodstains all over her clothes. Physically, she really 
seemed fine, but…</p><p>Sitting on the bed, Tifa threw the crutches away, angry with 
herself. She knew it was wrong to blame herself, but… “Dammit, why is it always you who has 
to suffer?” With tears in her eyes, Tifa leaned down, moved a strand of brown hair from 
Aerith's forehead, and gently kissed her. No reaction. Stressed out and at her limit, in 
pain and with all of her stained clothes still on, Tifa lay down next to her lover, held her 
hands, and fell asleep in seconds. It had been too long of a day.</p><p>“Kairi?” Naminè had 
left the bathroom. The blood was all gone, but the numerous scratches and cuts were still 
there. Even though they had stopped bleeding, they hurt. Kairi seemed to have forgotten or 
was just too tired to give her new clothes, so she was wearing a long towel. Kairi herself 
was just wearing a long shirt she had pulled from her drawers.</p><p>“Kairi, are you awake? 
Don't sleep here, you'll catch a cold.” Naminè knelt down, checking if Kairi was really 
sleeping.</p><p>“I'm sorry…” Kairi uttered, and averted her eyes when Naminè got down to 
look at her face to face. “It's my fault you have to go through all this. I…would understand 
if you want to quit but…I need you. I need you, Naminè. Don't go away.” Kairi's voice was 
watery as if she were about to cry.</p><p>Naminè moved in closer, forcing Kairi to look at 
her. “I will never leave you,” the blond girl said, kissing the redhead on the cheek. 
“Never. I'm afraid of being a Keyblader. But I'm even more scared of losing you. I want to 
be with you.” Naminè smiled despite everything that had happened. She always smiled for 
Kairi.</p><p>Choking down her tears, Kairi leaned her own forehead on Naminé's. “I…thanks. 
Thank you,” was the only thing she could say. There had been so much she wanted to say to 
Naminè if she wanted to stop. Wanted to go away. To run away from cruel fate. But she was 
strong. Was it because of Naminè that she could think about tomorrow and not worry what 
would happen?</p><p>“Let's go to sleep. I'm…really tired.” Naminé said, and stood up, 
holding her hand out for Kairi to take. With a faint smile, the girl in the long shirt took 
the offer and walked back to her room together with Naminè. Switching from towel to a long 
shirt, Naminè soon joined the redhead in her bed.</p><p>“I love you,” Naminè said before she 
fell asleep. With a relieved expression, Kairi rolled over, facing the blond girl, and 
kissed her on the forehead.</p><p>“I love you too.”</p><p align='center'>---Valiant 
Hearts---</p><p>Hours later, the bombardment was finally finished. The district and 
everything surrounding it was covered in soot and dirt. It was a big pile of rubble now. A 
monument of destruction. They all had underestimate the Heartless, thought they were safe in 
Hollow Bastion. How wrong they had been. It really was true—Power led to Arrogance. 
Arrogance to Decadence. Decadence to Destruction.</p><p>Cid was exhausted beyond his limits. 
He and Leon were sitting near the tent that had been transformed into the center of command 
for the time being. The Heartless were gone now, and so was the district. Cid had burned it 
down literally to the ground. Nothing but ash and unidentifiable charred rubbish remained. 
The smoke of the fire had risen high enough to be seen from miles away. It would take a long 
time to fix this place.</p><p>“Not counting us and the Keybladers, we have 117 wounded. So 
many…” Leon said. For over an hour he had taken reports and given out orders. He was holding 
his forehead, distressed. What pained him more than his injuries was his feeling of guilt. 
Was this all his fault? Had he miscalculated along the way? Screw up? He had sworn to never 
lose someone important to him again. But now his past had caught up with him. People were 
getting injured all the time. They had to fight even though it was not their place to do so. 
And he could do nothing to stop it. He felt so powerless. It was agonizing.</p><p>“I don't 
even want to think about how much this will cost us,” Cid added and looked at the enormous 
smoke cloud that stretched out easily a hundred and fifty feet in the sky. His defense 
system had proven itself to be completely useless. It was completely powerless against an 
attack of this magnitude. Even he was depressed about this.</p><p align='center'>---Valiant 
Hearts---</p><p>“What…happened here?” Olette stood motionless in front of the gigantic pile 
of rubble. They had seen the gigantic black cloud rising from Hollow Bastion when they had 
still been miles away. Now they saw firsthand what caused the cloud. The barrier was gone, 
and in front of them was a massive pile of rubble. People were working on carrying stone 
fragments and charred rubbish away in attempts to clean up the place. Every other corner had 
people on it—some injured, some merely exhausted beyond their limits. It was the aftermath 
of a battle that had resulted in a hollow victory.</p><p>After a few minutes of looking 
around, Olette and Yuffie finally found Leon, who was still giving out orders. He looked old 
and stretched, like he had been awake for days.</p><p>“Leon! What in the world happened 
here?” Yuffie blurted out while Olette was unable to get out a word. They had only been away 
for roughly three days!</p><p>“The Heartless attacked us. We managed to hold them off, but 
you yourself can see the cost that came with it. Everyone is at their limit. We really 
could've used your help.” Leon added the last remark after a short pause.</p><p>Suddenly, 
Olette was trembling. This was done by the Heartless? This?! She had known that they were 
dangerous, but this was beyond anything she had ever imagined. This was the destruction a 
war held, something she only knew from books. Now that she was aware of it, she could smell 
it. The stench of blood, of fire. The stench of a battlefield. It instantly made her throw 
up and she fell on her knees. After a few pats on the back from Yuffie, Olette was wide 
awake. Now that disgust had passed, fear and anxiety took possession of her.</p><p>“What 
about the others? Is everyone okay? Is Kairi okay?”</p><p>Shocked, Olette took a step back. 
What if…they were gone? She had never settled things with Kairi and now that she saw all 
this, she was aware of just how dangerous their lives, their destinies were. Feeling a tight 
knot in her chest, Olette impatiently waited for an answer. Leon looked at her. He was 
tired. “Tifa has a broken leg. I don't know the details, but Aerith seems to be in a coma or 
something. Kairi and Naminè…” Leon made a pause. They had been forced to close the gate 
forcefully. From the past, he knew how much strain it put on their bodies. And this portal 
had been huge. “I think they are fine. They should be at home. They should be 
sleeping.”</p><p>Olette was relieved. Everyone was alive. But now something different was 
occupying her mind. Why had she been so afraid that Kairi was gone? Olette felt depressed. 
She had been sure she was through with this. Yuffie looked at her with a worried 
expression.</p><p>“Let's go home.”</p><p>With a nod, Yuffie laid an arm around Olette's 
shoulders. With worried faces, they left.</p><p>The black smoke was not only clouding the 
sky, but also the mood of the entire town. People were afraid and scared. Nobody wanted to 
leave their house.</p><p>In the end, everyone was just human. Nobody could've been able to 
predict this tragedy. But people still blamed themselves, some for the pain of others, some 
for their own failures, and some for both. Hollow Bastion had seen a dark, dark night, and 
an even darker day. Everyone was hoping that something like this would never happen 
again.</p>
