<a href="../kinghart/valiant2-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><p align='center'><i>Advancing Hearts -</i></p><p align='center'><i>Surprise 
Surprise</i></p><p>Three weeks had passed since Kairi and Olette had their last fight. There 
was no need to avoid each other, as they were more than just busy with the new crazy 
schedules that Leon, Tifa, and Aerith had pulled out of their sleeves. The Committee was 
less needed than before, and even though Leon remained head of affairs, Tifa and Aerith were 
looking forward to working in their pub. With picking up work, though, it would become more 
or less impossible to train the girls, so they tried to get done in time as much as 
possible.</p><p>It was hard, to say the least. In the evenings of their first few days of 
their new training schedule, all of the girls were so tired that they did nothing but 
shower, eat, and go to sleep. It was a life in hell, a hell they were required to go 
through. After those three weeks, they would be on their own. They had to train each 
other—Naminè in magic, Olette in physical combat. Kairi would still get lessons from Leon, 
but she was responsible for relaying her knowledge to the other two.</p><p>Regardless of 
their personal affairs, Leon insisted on them working together.</p><p>There were no free 
days, no breaks. Even Tifa and Aerith felt that they were going to their limits, and for 
once, they had their doubts if they were overdoing it. But thinking back a few weeks, when 
Kairi and the girls had returned alive only thanks to the king, their doubts 
vanished.</p><p>The Organization was too powerful. Beyond their expectations, far beyond the 
capabilities of the girls back then. It was hard, but they had little other choice. Kairi 
knew it, and so did the other two.</p><p>Olette was still staying at Yuffie's place and 
didn't talk to Kairi anymore. It was like she hoped to forget all about it if she ignored it 
long enough. Kairi and Naminè, despite wanting to develop their relationship further, had to 
postpone it. They had barely the energy to talk, much less to do something else after the 
ridiculous exercise they were put through each day.</p><p>The last day of training finally 
came. Naminè was now quite a reliable magician, able to use basic elementals instantaneously 
along with powerful recitation magic. Olette was way beyond Kairi in terms of raw power. She 
also had mastered a unique style of fighting, one only she was capable of.</p><p>Kairi 
showed less advancement than the other two. While she was more balanced in her abilities 
than the others, she was held back by her constant doubts and worries about Olette. She 
wanted to get away from it, far away.</p><p>Half a week passed since the pub opened. Yuffie, 
true to her word, started working as a waitress for Tifa. Training was put on hold. They 
were exhausted and tired beyond their imagination. They didn't know where the Organization 
would show up next, and going randomly to worlds would only cause problems. All they could 
do was wait.</p><p align='center'>---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>“I feel dead.”</p><p>Olette was 
lying face-down on the bed, in just shorts and a long shirt—clothes she had bought with the 
money Yuffie had given her. It was against her nature to spend money on unnecessary things, 
but a few sets of clothes really helped out.</p><p>“I'm pretty sure Tifa worked you to the 
bone. Your muscles are as tense as Tifa's relationship with Leon,” Yuffie 
replied.</p><p>“Might as well die, then.”</p><p>“It's been three days already and you're 
still worn out.” Yuffie was knelt over Olette, massaging her back in an attempt to get her 
to relax a bit.</p><p>“It's not really over. I'm supposed to train with the 
others.”</p><p>Olette avoided saying Kairi's name on purpose. Things were going well between 
her and Yuffie and she didn't want to ruin the atmosphere right now. Also, she didn't really 
want to think about Kairi.</p><p>“Do you ever get a break? Poor thing.” Yuffie rolled her 
eyes.</p><p>“Am I your toy now or something?” Olette moaned when Yuffie got some of the 
tension in her back to go away.</p><p>“No, of course not,” Yuffie said in a subtle, sinister 
tone. “You've always been,” she added.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, sure, Yuffie. At least you've 
stopped groping me like I'm a doll.”</p><p>“I'd never grope a doll.” Yuffie replied. 
“They're flat.”</p><p>Olette smelled a opportunity for some payback. “Like <i>you</i> 
are.”</p><p>The following second Olette yelped in pain when Yuffie pressed a wrong 
joint.</p><p>“I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it!” she moaned.</p><p>“Good.” Yuffie had a 
really evil grin on her face.</p><p>They continued to chit chat over small things, such as 
Olette's training, Yuffie's work as a waitress in Tifa's pub, and what they should do for 
the weekend. They couldn't come to an agreement and decided to put it on hold until it 
actually was the weekend. It would be their first weekend without responsibility. Yuffie's 
shifts were being covered by Lilly, a girl who was relatively new in Hollow Bastion. And 
Olette was free anyway.</p><p>“You're so stubborn, it's almost at Leon's level…” Olette 
complained at dinner.</p><p>“You're unreasonable.”</p><p>“Fine, then you decide. I don't 
care anymore.” Olette started sulking and stood up.</p><p>They were eating on the roof, 
Yuffie's idea. Taking their plates with them away from the usual chaos they lived in, eating 
on the roof while watching the sunset was really something. When the stars came out, they 
moved closer together. For Olette ,it was like a scene out of a romance novel.</p><p>Yuffie 
waited until Olette was gone and started to laugh to herself. She had planned this all in 
secret, in detail, over the past week, and now her plan was finally taking form. Her evil 
scheme would soon pay off. Slightly spacing out by her thoughts, Yuffie started to drool a 
bit and some sauce fell on her top.</p><p>Olette had grown accustomed to the daily routine 
of going to bed—that is, avoiding Yuffie's futile gropes and seductive attempts, and 
sleeping. Olette was pretty sure she was going out with Yuffie, as they kissed pretty often 
and her resistance to Yuffie's attempts grew thin sometimes.</p><p>“Come down already, 
Yuffie. I want to go to bed. If I have to go alone, you can cook your own food for the next 
week,” Olette called up.</p><p>It was amazing that Yuffie could live solely from the instant 
food she got herself in the market in the business district. Olette was sick of instant food 
after a week and had somehow gotten herself the burden of cooking from then on. She was 
terrible at the beginning, but she improved fast.</p><p>“I'm coming. You can already 
undress,” Yuffie called back.</p><p>“You wish!” Olette said, but she had to grin.</p><p>She 
missed Naminè, but living with Yuffie was pretty nice. She was a real tease, but deep down 
she was really cute, and attractive too. It amazed Olette that no one had ever tried to hit 
on Yuffie. If they got past the continuous teasing, she was really nice.</p><p>Olette wore 
just a long shirt to bed. Yuffie had adapted and did the same, even though she had slept 
naked for some time before Olette started staying at her place. The other day they had spent 
a lot of time just looking at each other, teasing each other, holding hands while lying in 
bed. Whenever she thought about it, Olette blushed slightly.</p><p>“Are you feeling better 
after the massage?” Yuffie had just joined Olette in bed.</p><p>“Yeah. Thanks a 
lot.”</p><p>Yuffie moved closer, trying to kiss Olette, but the brunette held a finger to 
her lips, stopping her halfway.</p><p>“I bet thousand Munny you didn't brush your teeth,” 
Olette said with a knowing smile.</p><p>“Tch…” Yuffie got up again and walked to the 
bathroom in just her shirt.</p><p>Olette did it every day, and Yuffie forgot it every day. 
Olette thought it was sort of gross to kiss someone who didn't brush their teeth on a 
regular basis.</p><p>The ninja didn't know and Olette had no intention of letting her know, 
since she would definitely switch shirts if she knew. Yuffie had a nice body, even though 
she was a bit on the poor side with her breasts. Of all the nights Yuffie had made her 
advances, Olette sometimes played along and had gotten to know Yuffie's body pretty 
well.</p><p>A few minutes later, Yuffie came back to bed with a slightly annoyed expression. 
She rolled her eyes and moved in closer to Olette. “Can I have my kiss now?”</p><p>“Yeah,” 
Olette said, and leaned a bit towards the black-haired girl.</p><p>She kissed Yuffie every 
so often, but it was still weird. She really liked it a lot and it felt good, but sometimes 
it made her remember the scene on the roof that had caused her to drift away from the 
others. But she had rarely thought about it during the last week, and Olette hoped that she 
would be over it soon.</p><p>Yuffie wasn't really sure how she felt about Olette. Did she 
just like her, or was there more? The past three weeks had been hard on her too. Yuffie felt 
lonely without Olette around. She thought she knew how it felt to love someone, but was this 
it? Yuffie was reluctant about falling in love with anyone. The last time didn't go so well 
for her, and it had left its mark. And what did Olette feel?</p><p>Did she still long for 
Kairi? Love her? If not, or even if she did, what were her feelings towards her? Yuffie 
planned to find out soon.</p><p>“So what are we gonna do tomorrow?” Olette was lying 
sideways, her head resting on her hand.</p><p>“A secret. I'll tell you tomorrow.” Yuffie 
smiled and caressed Olette's cheek with her left index finger.</p><p>“You're so nice 
today…you're plotting something, aren't you?” Olette could smell one of Yuffie's schemes two 
miles against the wind.</p><p>“Even if I were, I wouldn't tell you.”</p><p>“Fine, have it 
your way.”</p><p>Olette turned around and pretended to be asleep. Soon after, two tender 
arms placed themselves around her waist. Yuffie loved to sleep that way and Olette didn't 
mind. That way, she at least knew where the hands of the thief were. Even though she 
occasionally slipped up and Yuffie groped her, she really liked this position as 
well.</p><p>The night came and went without any incident. Olette slept exceptionally well 
that night. She only woke up when she heard the noise of a train. Yuffie must've left the 
windows open.</p><p>“Yuffie…close the window. I can hear the trains, it's 
annoying…”</p><p>It took a moment for Olette to realize that it was her place that was close 
to the train station, not Yuffie's. Then where was the noise coming from?</p><p>Opening her 
eyes, Olette's mind sort of stopped working. Across from her sat Yuffie, in jean shorts and 
a black shirt with a white camellia flower on it. The outfit really suited her. It was 
accompanied by knee-high black boots. She was looking to the side, and this view really made 
Olette feel weird. Next to Yuffie was a bag.</p><p>Olette tried to comprehend for a second. 
A bag. Train noise. Yuffie in not-so-casual clothes.</p><p>Looking right, her brain finally 
started working. There was a window, and the landscape was moving past her fast. She was 
<i>inside</i> a train! But when and how and why…?</p><p>She looked down at herself. She was 
wearing a pair of tight blue jeans and a short yellow top, baring her midriff. It wasn't too 
unusual, but she wasn't too happy about the belly-exposing top. But why in the world was she 
barefoot?</p><p>“Yuffie. Explanation. You have ten seconds before I snap.”</p><p>“Good 
morning, Olette.” Yuffie only now noticed Olette and looked at her, 
smiling.</p><p>“Eight.”</p><p>“A trip to the beach. I said it's a secret, didn't I?” Yuffie 
continued to smile.</p><p>“How the hell did you get me here without me waking up?” Olette 
looked out the window. The sun was high, it must be around noon. The cabin was mostly empty; 
as far as she could see, they were alone.</p><p>“I carried you. You were so relaxed sleeping 
in my arms, I didn't want to wake you up,” Yuffie replied, completely calm.</p><p>“I have a 
thousand questions! Dammit, Yuffie! Where are we headed? What is in this bag? Where did you 
get the money for the tickets? How long are we going to be gone anyway? And why the hell am 
I <i>barefoot</i>?”</p><p>“Milos Rista, swimsuits, saving up, three days 'n two nights, 
couldn't find your shoes.” Yuffie responded with minimal effort.</p><p>Olette was about to 
explode and it was clearly visible.</p><p>“Now calm down, Olette. We're going to Milos 
Rista, a beach resort. We're a bit early for the season but it's warm this year. I put some 
clothes and our swimsuits in the bag. We're staying at a little house that was for daily 
rent directly on the beach. And I really couldn't find your shoes, I swear. I couldn't find 
mine either, so I had to go with boots to the beach!”</p><p>“They look nice. You should wear 
them more often.” Olette couldn't tell Yuffie that she had a bit of a boots 
fetish.</p><p>“And why the hell didn't you tell me…wait, did you say <i>our</i> swimsuits? I 
don't remember bringing one from home and I never bought one!”</p><p>Yuffie's expression 
went from a smile to a devilish smirk to an outright evil grin. So evil, Olette was a bit 
repelled by it. To make it worse, Yuffie started groping air and stared at Olette. It was 
really unpleasant, and Olette blushed deeply.</p><p>“I bought one for you,” Yuffie then 
said.</p><p>“But you don't know my size! What am I gonna do if it won't fit?” Olette wasn't 
too happy with the thought of being at the beach without being able to go 
swimming.</p><p>“It will. <i>It will</i>.” Yuffie put such emphasis on the second one that 
Olette got curious.</p><p>“Why are you so…oh dear God…the groping. You groped me to measure 
my bust size!” Olette pointed at Yuffie.</p><p>“I wanted it to be a surprise, really. And 
you have such nice boobs, I couldn't resist anyway.”</p><p>Olette went silent for a moment, 
but then sighed. That was Yuffie, all right. No doubt about it. What kind of swimsuit would 
she have bought? To begin with, Olette had never gone to the beach before. She could swim, 
she regularly went to the pool in Twilight Town, but the beach…</p><p>“Just enjoy the trip, 
Olette. I wanted you to get away from Hollow Bastion for a while. To relax and…I wanted to 
spend some time alone with you,” Yuffie said, and for the first time, Olette saw the ninja 
blush.</p><p>Only Yuffie could say such things so bluntly like that, and it made Olette feel 
special. She forgave Yuffie for the wannabe kidnapping and for the lack of shoes. But she 
still wasn't sure how she felt about Yuffie groping her all the time and buying a swimsuit 
for her.</p><p>“How long did you say we're going to stay there?” Olette leaned on the seat 
and looked closer at Yuffie. She looked really, <i>really</i> nice in that getup. What kind 
of swimsuit would Yuffie wear? A bikini? No, she lacked the bust for that…a sports 
two-piece? It would conceal her bust size somewhat, and Yuffie in trunks was pretty 
believable…a one-piece was too lame a choice to be realistic.</p><p>“Are you all right? Your 
nose is bleeding.” Yuffie pointed at Olette, who was spacing out.</p><p>“What, really? Oh, 
dammit!” Olette grabbed her nose but there was nothing.</p><p>“I bet you were imaging 
something perverted!” Yuffie was teasing her again.</p><p>“And I have every reason to,” 
Olette replied, and now it was Yuffie who was caught by surprise but smiled 
afterwards.</p><p>They went silent again, both staring out the window for several minutes. 
After a while, Yuffie was lost in her thoughts. She would clear a few things up while on 
this trip, and if all went well, she and Olette…</p><p>Olette had changed places. Instead of 
sitting across from Yuffie, she was now sitting right next to her, laying one hand on 
Yuffie's exposed legs, the other on her cheek, kissing her all of a sudden. Caught by 
surprise, Yuffie opened her eyes wide and looked at Olette, stunned for a 
second.</p><p>“What was that for?” Yuffie asked.</p><p>Olette rested her head on Yuffie's 
shoulder, entangled her fingers with Yuffie's, and and closed her eyes. Really happy to have 
her next to her, Olette moved as close to Yuffie as she could.</p><p>“You're nice, doing all 
this for me. Your methods are really crazy sometimes, but…I really like you. I like you a 
lot.”</p><p>It wasn't a confession, right? Olette was sure it didn't count as one. She 
didn't know if she really felt like that about Yuffie yet. But the black-haired girl was 
blushing worse than before, searching for a response that would relieve some of the tension 
in the air. Something to tease her, anything! But nothing came. In the end, Yuffie decided 
to go with whatever came to mind.</p><p>“I tend to do such things for the girl I have set my 
eyes on.”</p><p>Silence. Then, mental self-destruction. Yuffie wanted to jump out the 
window. A more cheesy and stupid line couldn't have come to mind!</p><p>“That's really 
cheesy, but I like that answer.” Olette smiled and stayed like she was, resting her head on 
Yuffie's shoulder and holding her hand.</p><p>“Did you tell anyone where we 
are?”</p><p>Yuffie looked slightly surprised, went all thoughtful for a second, and then she 
answered with a wide smile, “Nope, didn't!” without feeling any guilt.</p><p>“Why am I not 
surprised? Well, I don't think they're gonna need us around.” Olette took a deep breath and 
pinched Yuffie a little. “You could have told <i>me,</i> at least!”</p><p>Yuffie twitched 
upon being pinched and looked as if she were about to start sulking. “If I had, it wouldn't 
have been a surprise.”</p><p>“But I would have shoes.”</p><p>“You don't need them on the 
beach!” Yuffie argued.</p><p>“Right. And what if we're gonna eat somewhere or if I want to 
go out? I can't turn up everywhere barefoot!” Olette replied, slightly upset.</p><p>“I'm 
sorry, okay? Now stop being upset about this, I didn't do it on purpose!” Yuffie was 
starting to get annoyed.</p><p>“Have some of your own medicine.” Olette grinned and poked 
her tongue out at Yuffie.</p><p>“I'm not gonna talk to you anymore.”</p><p>“Suit 
yourself.”Olette's grin grew more huge by the second.</p><p>They continue to tease and annoy 
each other for a while until Olette fell back asleep on Yuffie's shoulder, but not without 
warning Yuffie that she would hit her if Yuffie tried anything funny. The ninja now had a 
glaring red hand mark on her cheek and was looking out the window, thinking about how lucky 
she was. A few days all alone with Olette on the beach…</p><p>“Wake up, Olette, wake up wake 
up wake up!” Yuffie was yelling.</p><p>Olette opened her eyes halfway, unable to comprehend 
what was happening. Yuffie dragged her along through the cabin, carrying their bags. The 
train was still and there was no sound. The engine must be off. That was odd.</p><p>“Are we 
finally there?” Olette asked, still half asleep.</p><p>“Eh, yeah, sort of.”</p><p>That woke 
Olette up. Sort of? What kind of answer was that? Either they were there or they weren't. 
What…</p><p>“Don't tell me you…” Olette gave Yuffie an ominous glare.</p><p>“I'm sorry!” 
Yuffie begged, and pulled Olette out of the train.</p><p>“So where exactly are 
we?!”</p><p>“Let me check…this is…oh…” Yuffie started to feel a bit sick.</p><p>Olette put 
her hand over her face. This just couldn't be true. How careless could someone be? This was 
topping everything Yuffie had ever done.</p><p>About three hours later, two girls, boiling 
in the heat, were walking down the sidewalk of a rarely used street, alongside a big field. 
The sun was shining mercilessly down on them. Yuffie had fallen asleep and they had missed 
their stop. They had no money for tickets, so they had to walk. And it was several hours' 
walk to Milos Rista from the outskirts of Larftis. Olette hadn't spoken to Yuffie ever since 
they started walking, and Yuffie had stopped trying after a hour without 
response.</p><p>“Will you be mad for the entire trip now?” Yuffie was seriously angry at 
herself for screwing up this badly. Also, she hated walking long distances.</p><p>Olette 
didn't respond. She was upset that Yuffie had first kidnapped her onto this trip and then 
screwed up on getting the right station on top of it. It was punishment for Yuffie that she 
didn't talk to her. But it was time to break the silence. Ahead of them, right next to the 
street, was a big tree that was spreading cooling shadow like a godsend.</p><p>Olette 
finally broke her silence. “Let's take a break.”</p><p>Without further ado they sat down on 
the tree's huge trunk, Yuffie placing their bags next to her, taking a break. She had welts 
from the bag she was carrying and it was so hot that they would get sunburned if they had to 
walk much further.</p><p>“I'm sorry for screwing up.” Yuffie was sitting a bit apart from 
Olette, slightly depressed over the continuous silence.</p><p>Olette ignored Yuffie and 
savored the change in temperature. It was like heaven. It was quiet, too, only a little bit 
of wind through the leaves in the tree's crown and the sound of the cicadas in the air. It 
was very relaxing, so much so that Olette closed her eyes and leaned back, just enjoying 
it.</p><p>Until something was in front of her, moving around. Something big. Opening one eye 
halfway, she spotted Yuffie, who was looking at her, smiling.</p><p>“Something on my face?” 
Olette sounded much angrier than she had intended. Yuffie pulled back, unsure if she could 
just go on and tease Olette a bit, or if she was still upset.</p><p>“No, I just enjoyed 
looking at your peaceful face,” Yuffie answered truthfully.</p><p>Olette took a deep breath 
as if to start a argument or a fight, and then flicked Yuffie's forehead. It left a tiny red 
mark.</p><p>“Now we're even.” Olette looked back up to the tree above them.</p><p>“That 
hurt!” Yuffie rubbed her forehead and sat down, her back directed to Olette.</p><p>“It 
should. You deserved it.”</p><p>They went quiet again, both listening to the sounds of 
summer. In Hollow Bastion, they barely noticed what time of the year it was. In summer it 
was barely hotter than in spring or fall, and winter was barely colder, let alone cold 
enough for snow.</p><p>Yuffie was startled when she was suddenly pulled from behind by 
Olette. When she hit the ground, she noticed that Olette had not simply pulled her to the 
ground but rather to herself. It was a nice position where her head was resting on Olette's 
lap, and she could look upwards directly in the brunette's face.</p><p>Olette played around 
with some strands of Yuffie's hair until she grew bored of it and started to tease Yuffie a 
little with letting her index finger move over her cheek repeatedly until Yuffie moved her 
head away, smiling but slightly annoyed at it.</p><p>Yuffie laid her hands under her head, 
looking up into the boughs of the tree. It was very relaxing to lie like that, and it had 
been a while since Yuffie, who was usually quite hyper, felt that calm. Olette picked up 
playing with her hair again, but it didn't bother her anymore.</p><p>Time passed and both 
girls fell asleep after a while. It was just too nice to get up and walk through the boiling 
heat again. Yuffie especially wasn't eager to get back in the sun.</p><p>They woke up when 
something that sounded like a buzzer disturbed the calmness of their resting place. Olette 
opened one eye and was startled to see that the bright sun had turned a deep red. It was 
already evening―at least past seven or eight. On the road, a few meters away from them, was 
a very old pickup truck, and a guy with a tattooed face and blond spiky hair was waving to 
them.</p><p>“Hey, you need a ride?”</p><p>Olette needed a moment to sort out her thoughts. 
They seemed to be driving in the direction of Milos Rista, and it would help get back the 
lost time. The guy seemed to be relatively harmless, too. Even though he had his face 
tattooed, he seemed nice.</p><p>A blond woman with glasses leaned over and looked outside 
the window. Two thick strands of hair framed her face, one on the left and one on the right. 
The rest of it in a ponytail. She seemed decent too, since she was smiling and waving at 
them.</p><p>“He's harmless, don't worry. We're going to Milos Rista. Need a ride?”</p><p>“I 
did just ask them, Quistis,” the guy blurted out, but got himself a 'be quiet' 
glare.</p><p>Olette decided that it was okay to hitch-hike and tried to wake up Yuffie. The 
ninja didn't quite want to wake up and turned around when Olette pushed her quite violently 
from her lap onto the ground. It took only so much to wake Yuffie up.</p><p>“Hey, that hurt! 
Whoa, what time is it?” Yuffie looked around and spotted the pickup, then looked to 
Olette.</p><p>“We got lucky and someone's offering to give us a ride. Get our stuff, I'll 
tell them.” Olette stood up. Her legs were a bit sore but she managed. “We're just gonna get 
our stuff, but we'll come with you!” she shouted.</p><p>As Olette walked over to the car, 
the guy was apparently being scolded by the woman. “Thanks for the ride. We missed our stop 
on the train and had to walk all the way from Larftis.”</p><p>“Whoa, that's no joke. It's 
like, a thousand miles till Milos from there. It's amazing you two got here. It's still hot 
as hell.” He was definitely of the annoying sort, loud and hyper. The exact opposite of the 
only other blond spiky head Olette knew.</p><p>“Yeah, well. Couldn't be helped.”</p><p>“So 
what are two girls doing going to Milos?” The woman asked.</p><p>“Taking a trip. Tired 
from…work. Needing a break. Yuffie, the black-haired girl over there, promised me to teach 
me how to surf.” It was all a big fat lie, but Olette couldn't tell them why they really 
were going there.</p><p>“What happened to your shoes? It must've been hell to walk barefoot 
in the heat.” The woman didn't question Olette's explanation of the trip.</p><p>“Forgot them 
on the train. We got off in a hurry and I forgot them. But I'm used to harsh stuff like 
that, I'm a runner. Thanks again for the ride. We were really in a mess right 
there.”</p><p>“No problem. I'm Quistis. This is Zell. We're driving from place to place, 
looking for our old friends. Do you happen to know them? Their names are Squall, Irvine, 
Selphie, and Rinoa.”</p><p>“I'm Olette. No, I'm sorry, never heard of them.” Olette didn't 
knew any of these names, but Squall did sound like something she had heard in the past. But 
she couldn't remember where.</p><p>“Phew, thanks for the ride. I was seriously worrying we 
were gonna sleep under the open sky tonight.” Yuffie had caught up and was feeling a bit 
dizzy from the sudden movement.</p><p>“I'm Quistis, this is Zell. Get in the back, we can 
talk through the window since it's missing. This car can't go very fast, so there isn't much 
wind,” Quistis said.</p><p>Yuffie got an odd vibe. It was like a command. That woman must've 
been an instructor somewhere sometime. She followed anyway. Olette managed to jump up just 
fine and Yuffie threw their stuff up there.</p><p>“So you are going to teach her surfing, 
huh? I wouldn't expect that, one girl to another. You're sure you don't want a nice surf 
teacher?” Quistis was laughing a bit and Olette blushed.</p><p>Yuffie gave her a questioning 
look but Olette only responded with a 'it couldn't be helped!' look and talked 
back.</p><p>The conversation went nowhere, interesting enough to keep going, and they 
eventually went silent. Olette kept her distance from Yuffie to avoid any suspicion from the 
friendly people in the front. It was pretty annoying to Yuffie, but she could somewhat 
understand that Olette wasn't too eager for other people to find out her 
preferences.</p><p>After roughly an hour by car, they could see the ocean. It was shimmering 
a dark red from the sun and it was an amazing view. Olette had never seen the ocean before, 
and it was captivating.</p><p>“Never seen the ocean before, have ya?” Zell asked.</p><p>“No. 
It's my first time,” Olette answered, lost in the beautiful view of the ocean.</p><p>“I bet 
ya make a nice figure in a biki―ahhhh!” Zell yelled out at the end. Quistis had pinched him 
in the leg.</p><p>“Don't mind him, he's a bit…too honest,” Quistis said.</p><p>A good half 
hour later, the car finally stopped and the girls jumped from the back, tired from the long 
way. It was time they got to their house. The first thing Olette would do in the morning was 
go and get herself some shoes. Her feet hurt like they had been pricked all over by 
needles.</p><p>“We'll be around for a few days, looking for our friends. Maybe we'll meet 
you two out at the beach,” Quistis said, and waved the two girls goodbye.</p><p>“Stop 
imagining her in a bikini, Yuffie. You'll sleep on the floor if you keep at it,” Olette 
said, and walked away from Yuffie in the direction of the beach.</p><p>“I wasn't doing that! 
Okay, maybe a little, but you gotta admit, she had a nice body.” Yuffie followed Olette, 
pointing in a certain direction. “Our place is that way.”</p><p>Olette adjusted her course 
and gave Yuffie a dangerous glare. “So all you see when you look at me is my body? That's 
nice to know.” Olette seemed pretty angry.</p><p>“Yes, I totally do. Hot, delicious Olette 
body,” Yuffie said and pretended to drool.</p><p>Olette stopped dead in her movements and 
looked at Yuffie, surprised and shocked. Was she being serious? If so…</p><p>No, she wasn't. 
Yuffie immediately started laughing at Olette's surprised face. She was back to being a 
tease, but Olette couldn't really be angry about that. It was just who Yuffie 
was.</p><p>“Over there. That's our place.” Yuffie pointed at a small house with lower floor 
veranda on front, not even a hundred feet away from the beach. There were windows in the 
upper floor. The view from there of the ocean must be just as amazing as earlier when they 
drove past the coast.</p><p>“Like it?” Yuffie stood there, satisfied with her 
choice.</p><p>“No, I hate it. It disgusts me,” Olette replied.</p><p>“If you're going to try 
and imitate me, you still have a lot to learn. Sparkling eyes aren't signs of disgust, 
Olette.” Yuffie giggled and walked past her, toward the house. She had gotten the keys 
already, way back when she had rented it for the time.</p><p>The inside wasn't luxurious, 
but it was decent. A living room with a fireplace and in front a big old couch that gave off 
a nice smell. The kitchen was right in the living room, and even though there wasn't too 
much in the fridge, it would suffice for just them. The upper floor was just two empty rooms 
and the bedroom, which consisted of two beds which they immediately pushed together to 
combine them into one big bed. Olette had gotten used to sleeping together with Yuffie, and 
she didn't want to sleep alone now.</p><p>“Want to take a dip?” Yuffie placed their bag on 
the bed and sat down on it.</p><p>“Now? Isn't the water cold by now?” Olette was rather 
tired from this quite eventful day and she wasn't sure about going to swim now. The sun was 
almost completely down. Only a red shimmer remained.</p><p>“The water never cools completely 
down in the summer. Even at night it's at a decent temperature. Also, if I have to wait any 
longer to see you in the swimsuit I chose, I'm going to go crazy,” Yuffie said, giving 
Olette a truly lecherous look.</p><p>“Pervert. But okay, I really want to go swimming in the 
ocean. Now get out!” Olette grabbed Yuffie's wrist and pushed her out of the room, slamming 
the door behind her.</p><p>A few seconds later Yuffie hear Olette gasp, mumble some words. 
Then there were steps, the door opened, Olette threw some clothes at Yuffie with a red face, 
and slammed the door again. “I'm going to kill you if you peek,” Olette said in a warning 
voice, and proceed to undress.</p><p>Yuffie smiled and just undressed down in the living 
room, throwing her clothes on the couch. Olette took her time and Yuffie grew bored and 
started building up some wood for a fire in the chimney.</p><p>Finally, after good ten 
minutes, Yuffie heard steps from the wooden stairs. Olette finally came down, wrapped in a 
towel.</p><p>With a annoyed “tch” Yuffie snapped her fingers. “Now don't be a prude!” she 
complained, and crossed her arms, leaning on the couch.</p><p>“You said it would fit, but 
it's totally tight around the chest!” Olette complained, still quite red in the 
face.</p><p>“It's supposed to be like that,” Yuffie replied, and showed again her lecherous 
look.</p><p>“I should've known,” Olette said and sighed. Finally looking at Yuffie, she 
almost dropped her towel. The tight jean shorts were barely over her hips, and to Olette's 
surprise, Yuffie was wearing a bikini top. A green bikini top with a neck holder. The pants 
were half open and below it showed a green-black striped bikini bottom piece. The jean 
shorts gave her a rebellious look, though. Olette grabbed her nose in reflex, anticipating a 
nosebleed, but nothing happened.</p><p>Yuffie was surprisingly well-built, not even close to 
Tifa or Aerith, but Olette didn't have a much bigger chest at all. It made her wonder why 
Yuffie was so concerned about her bust size.</p><p>“Why are you always complaining about 
your bust size? It looks fine!” Olette blurted out, confused and curious.</p><p>Yuffie 
looked surprised and averted her eyes. For all the time she had been with Cloud's group, all 
the attention, even at Costa de Sol, had gone to Tifa and Aerith. “Some reasons. You think 
it's fine? Really?”</p><p>It was so cute to see Yuffie insecure and embarrassed. Olette 
moved closer, just for a second revealing herself, then wrapped the big towel around both of 
them. Leaning her own forehead on Yuffie's, Olette smiled.</p><p>“Yeah, it looks fine. I 
don't think yours is any smaller than mine, really.”</p><p>Olette immediately regretted that 
choice of words. Yuffie would grab her boobs in a mere seconds, she was sure. It was like an 
invitation to do so. Ready to get angry and worked up, Olette waited for a moment, but 
nothing happened.</p><p>Yuffie didn't even say anything, she only looked at Olette, 
embarrassed and somewhat happy. She wanted to see below the towel, but she had waited so 
long, she could wait another few minutes and not destroy this nice situation by acting like 
a teenager that was craving for sex.</p><p>“So, you like your swimsuit?” Yuffie asked rather 
cautiously.</p><p>“I'm a bit mad that it's a bit too tight, but aside from that, it's nice. 
I like the color, really,” Olette answered. Now it was her turn to be embarrassed.</p><p>“It 
stretches, don't worry. I just wanted to tease you a bit.”</p><p>It felt weird. Yuffie never 
explained her jokes, her teasing actions. But there was some special atmosphere between 
them, some sparks. Olette could feel the warmth of Yuffie's body right in front of her, just 
inches away. Her heart was beating faster with every second until she finally took the towel 
off and wrapped it around herself, turning around. With a bright red face, Olette walked to 
the door, opening it and then looking back, over her shoulder.</p><p>“Aren't you coming? I'm 
gonna leave you behind.” Olette left straight after saying that and only stopped when she 
had almost reached the water. It was a nice place to drop the towel, but it was still a bit 
embarrassing. But why? She had shown herself in bikinis in the Twilight Town pool all the 
time, and this wasn't even a bikini. Was it because of Yuffie? Was she embarrassed to have 
Yuffie see her in a swimsuit? That was ridiculous. But…</p><p>“Suits you.” Yuffie standing a 
few feet behind her, grinning dirtily and amused by the sudden change in Olette. So she 
wasn't just a tough girl, she had a soft side too. Walking up to the brunette, Yuffie blew a 
bit of air on her neck, surprising Olette, and ran towards the water, jumping 
in.</p><p>Standing still in front of the ocean, Olette looked at the night sky. Stars had 
come out, and now that she had come this far, a few things were becoming more clear. She did 
want to be with Yuffie.</p><p>“<i>Follow your heart.”</i></p><p>Olette turned around. 
Someone had whispered in her ear. But no one was there, and Yuffie was plowing through the 
low waves, having fun while diligently watching Olette. Who had said that?</p><p>“Aren't you 
going to swim?” Yuffie was shouting.</p><p>Looking once again behind her, to the sand that 
showed no sign of anyone else around, Olette dropped her towel and finally let the sea 
embrace her. It wasn't cold, it was pleasant. Yuffie was swimming like a fish, but Olette 
had expected as much. After all, she was the one responsible for recon and intelligence from 
other worlds in the group.</p><p>Olette made a few powerful strokes and vanished under the 
water. The water was crystal clear, she could see the ground even though it was dark. Clams 
and rocks filled the sand and not much further ahead was a little island with a palm tree. 
It reminded her of that place. Exhausted from the long day, Olette let herself float on the 
water.</p><p>Floating on her back and watching the stars, Olette didn't notice that Yuffie 
had followed her and was now right beside her. “You really love the stars, don't you?” she 
asked.</p><p>“I don't know. I feel calm when I look at them. Always did. Maybe it's because 
I'm a Keyblader, but I'd like to think that because they're beautiful.” Looking next to her, 
Olette saw that Yuffie had joined her. Floating on her back, her gaze toward the stars, 
Yuffie seemed like a different person.</p><p>“Beautiful, huh…” Yuffie sighed and closed her 
eyes. “I wish I were just half as beautiful as a star.” Yuffie complained, took a deep 
breath and vanished underwater, showing up seconds later in front of Olette.</p><p>“I never 
thought of myself as beautiful,” Yuffie said, swimming a few feet ahead. “With Tifa and 
Aerith around, I never really stood a chance.” Turning around, the black-haired girl looked 
at Olette, who had gone back to a swimming position, slowly coming closer.</p><p>“To me you 
are beautiful.” Olette embraced her from behind, slowly laying her arms around her 
shoulders, resting her head on Yuffie's back.</p><p>Yuffie felt different about Olette 
compared to before. It wasn't like she was just playing around. Olette was serious, and so 
was she.</p><p>The moon was shining down on the two girls, warming each other in a tight 
embrace, silent and calmly enjoying the moment. Ever so slowly, Yuffie turned around, 
thoughtful not to break their embrace, till she looked right into the eyes of her partner. 
The words were on her tongue, but she didn't dare say them. Yuffie just continued looking in 
those deep green eyes she liked. Seconds stretched to minutes and minutes to an eternity as 
Olette reached for her cheek, coming closer, just bit for bit, until only a mere instant lay 
between them.</p><p>Olette didn't dare say it either. It didn't feel like the place, the 
time to say it. Was she hesitating? No. But what else was keeping her from it? Was Yuffie 
waiting for it? She had been staring forever in her eyes, but had said nothing. Did she mean 
to say it? Want to say it? If so, why didn't she? Because Yuffie knew she could not respond, 
not answer to those three magic words? She didn't want this moment to end. Slowly laying a 
hand on Yuffie's cheek, she moved in closer and closer until she could feel the dampness of 
her hair, see the tiniest water drops on her face.</p><p>“I'm freezing,” Olette whispered in 
Yuffie's ear. The water was taking its toll. Now it was dark, and the last rays of the 
warming sun had vanished past the horizon.</p><p>“We both are. I'll warm you up.” Yuffie 
grinned and moved in the last bit, so that their bodies finally closed in together, sharing 
their warmth, trying to keep out the cold from the sea.</p><p>“Why does that make me worry…” 
Olette whispered, but didn't move away.</p><p>Yuffie was surprised. Usually, Olette would 
flinch at the first given opportunity. “You're right. Let's get out of the water.” Yuffie 
said, kissing Olette for a second, then breaking away and swimming to the 
shore.</p><p>“Still the same old tease,” Olette said, rolling her eyes, and she started to 
follow her partner. The fresh night air that awaited them when they left the water made them 
eager to get inside and warm up. Their towels didn't help much since they were still wearing 
the soaked swimsuits. Yuffie waited at the door, holding it open for Olette.</p><p>“Hurry 
up, you slow thing. I'm turning into an ice block here.” Yuffie waved with her 
hand.</p><p>“Don't be so cocky. You had a head start, you cheat.” Both were out of breath 
and freezing cold. Thank God they had ignited a fire before they left for a swim. Yuffie 
looked through a few drawers for blankets and couldn't find anything but a thin white 
coverlet.</p><p>“Here we go.” Yuffie threw the blanket over Olette, who had moved the couch 
a bit closer to the chimney and was now sitting on it. Wrapping it around herself, Olette 
noticed that Yuffie had no second blanket. On top of that, the ninja started to undress in 
the middle of the room.</p><p>“What are you doing?!” Olette blushed and averted her 
eyes.</p><p>Yuffie laughed and moved to the couch, kneeling before her. “Do <i>you</i> want 
to undress me?”</p><p>It made Olette blush even more. Yuffie already knew the answer and was 
moving back to finish undressing. It was fun to make the brunette embarrassed, so much that 
even now, Yuffie could hardly keep herself in check.</p><p>“You really have no shame, 
Yuffie.” Olette sighed and covered herself in the blanket. The wet swimsuit was icy and it 
was giving her goosebumps. She needed to get it off herself and fast. But undressing in 
front of Yuffie? She'd die of embarrassment before she finished. At least the blanket 
provided some protection against Yuffie's stare.</p><p>“Let me down there,” Yuffie demanded, 
and Olette looked instantly worried and alarmed. Yuffie was standing right in front of her, 
naked. She didn't want to admit it, but she liked what she saw. The black-haired girl had 
some nice curves. “Come on, it's cold. Don't be stingy, now!”</p><p>Saying that, Yuffie 
forced her way under the blanket, seconds later laying her arms around Olette. She 
immediately noticed the ice cold swimsuit.</p><p>“You're still wearing that?! You're gonna 
catch a cold.” And with a diabolical expression, Yuffie added, “Let me take that off for 
you,” as she started to pull on Olette's top.</p><p>“Thanks, but no thanks. I'll do it 
myself. And don't you dare look! I'll kill you on the spot!” Olette responded, angry, 
embarrassed, blushing furiously.</p><p>“Tch, stingy.” But Yuffie followed the order and 
closed her eyes. She soon noticed the blanket was left on her, and that Olette had stood up. 
Slowly opening one eye, Yuffie instantly looked into two angry green eyes.</p><p>“I said no 
peeking!” Olette hit Yuffie on the head as punishment, but not hard enough to hurt her. 
Waiting for Yuffie to finally follow her order, she pulled off the wet top, shivered, and 
hung it on a hook near the chimney. Next was…the bottom.</p><p>Looking around and giving 
Yuffie a closer look, Olette took it off, standing in the middle of the room, the fire 
showing her naked silhouette on the wall.</p><p>Crawling back under the blanket, Yuffie 
opened her eyes as soon as she noticed the presence of her girlfriend. Olette was still as 
red as a ripe tomato.</p><p>“You're so cute when you're embarrassed.” Yuffie moved closer, 
sitting so close to the brunette that they could feel the warmth of each other's bodies. 
Olette took a deep breath. She was now more nervous than embarrassed, but being with Yuffie 
had always been kind of reassuring for her, despite her constant teasing.</p><p>“You don't 
mind, right?” Yuffie smiled and proceed to snuggle with Olette. She didn't feel like 
stopping her, didn't feel like ruining this mood.</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>The short response 
threw Yuffie completely off track. “You do?…”</p><p>Olette sighed, followed by a smile. She 
did mind, but it was Yuffie after all. “I do, but did you ever let that stop you before?” 
Ever so subtly, Olette was showing Yuffie she didn't really mind.</p><p>The air was warm, 
and now that the cold clothes were gone, she was slowly warming up. Not to mention that 
Yuffie was right next to her under the blanket. “We can put the blanket away if you want, 
I'll warm you with my body.” Yuffie was showing her usual evil smirk.</p><p>“I'll hold onto 
it, thanks.” Olette put her off and moved a bit closer to the front, to the warming fire. 
Yuffie took that chance to get behind her, laying her arms around her waist, pushing her 
chest on Olette's back. She waited for the angry reaction, for Olette to put her off. But 
nothing came, much to Yuffie's surprise.</p><p>Her finger slowly wandered over Olette's 
stomach up to her chest. She had done this many times before, but she was never as excited 
as now. Her breathing was going faster with each centimeter she went up, and when Olette 
didn't react when she reached her chest, Yuffie dared to lay her hands on her breasts, 
fondling them a bit. Still no reaction.</p><p>“You aren't asleep, are you?” Yuffie whispered 
in the brunette's ear.</p><p>First, no response. Then, giggling.</p><p>“You really know how 
to kill the mood, don't you?” Olette said, looking over her shoulder.</p><p>“I…just…hum…” 
Olette had caught her on cold feet. Out of lack of a snappy remark, Yuffie just stuck her 
tongue at Olette and breathed hot air on her neck. The ninja could feel the following 
goosebumps as well as Olette could.</p><p>A couple of kisses followed the hot air, much to 
the pleasure of the brunette who was finally giving in to the advances of her partner. 
Breaking away from Yuffie, who thought she had gone too far, Olette only stood up to turn 
around, to sit on Yuffie's lap. The blanket still covered them, and they could feel the 
warmth of their skin under it.</p><p>“I'll hit you if you aren't gentle,” Olette said, 
furiously blushing a deep red. Yuffie was taken aback a bit by the bold statement, but was 
already back on her feet.</p><p>“Don't worry, I'll do my best.” Yuffie's answer was 
accompanied by rolling eyes to the other side.</p><p>“That's exactly what I'm afraid 
of.”</p><p>Without further ado, Yuffie laid her hands yet again on Olette's neck, pulling 
her closer, exchanging kisses which soon merged into a play of hot tongues. The blanket was 
long forgotten when it hit the ground, and the only sound was the sizzling of the wood 
burning and the moans of two shadows, painted on the wall by the warm fire.</p><p 
align='center'>---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>Rays of sunlight forced Olette to wake up. Her 
head was a mess, and looking down, she was naked. Not only that, but right next to her was 
Yuffie. They weren't in their bed, but on the couch.</p><p>The last night came slowly back 
to her and Olette slightly blushed when looking at Yuffie. With a moan, Yuffie moved, and 
the thin blanket that covered her fell down.</p><p>Averting her eyes, Olette took the 
blanket up and wrapped it around herself, looked left and right, then made a dash to their 
room to put on some clothes. As she took some of Yuffie's clothes back down, Olette finally 
thought about the last night.</p><p>She had slept with Yuffie. Memories made her blush 
again, but it had been really nice. But something gave her a weird feeling. It was like she 
had stepped over an invisible line…but she had no regrets other than not being able to 
remember much of her first time.</p><p>“You're no fun, running as soon as you get up. I 
wanted to cuddle some more.” Yuffie looked over the back of the couch and smiled widely. 
“Aw, last night was awesome. Or rather, you were. Where did you learn to do that with your 
tong―”</p><p>Olette threw the clothes at Yuffie who was thrown off. “Get dressed, 
jeez.”</p><p>With things as they were, Yuffie tried to make breakfast but almost set the 
kitchen on fire, resulting in Olette making some scrambled eggs and bread. “You should learn 
to cook. It's a pain to always do it.” Olette complained while sitting on the table and 
taking a big bite of the fresh bread.</p><p>“I'm just not suited to that kind of work. But I 
don't know what I would do without you. I can't imagine going back to eating fast food every 
day now. I'd starve to death, so you better never leave me alone for too long.” Yuffie was 
partially talking with full mouth and Olette rolled her eyes watching her.</p><p>“You have 
absolutely no manners, do you know that?”</p><p>“I do. Didn't know you were picky about that 
sort of stuff.” Yuffie gulped down a glass of juice, leaned back and burped, much to the 
displeasure of Olette.</p><p>“It wouldn't kill you to show some manners. At least when you 
eat with me. Or you can eat alone in the future. And cook your own meals.” Olette had found 
a weak spot and she would exploit that one freely as long as she could.</p><p>“That's 
blackmailing! But if you want, I can try. Don't expect too much, though.” Yuffie sulked in 
her chair and looked towards the window. “It's nice out there. Let's go for a stroll.” She 
had to change the topic somehow.</p><p>“Nice dodge. But okay. You wash the…I take that back, 
I'll wash the dishes. I don't want them to break. I want to see the area. I like swimming, 
but we just ate and I don't wanna get a cramp and drown.” Olette took Yuffie's plate and 
with a sigh, put them into the kitchen sink and starting cleaning them.</p><p>“We can go see 
the market. It's the weekend, therefore there'll be one hell of a crowd. You'll have to look 
out for thieves.” Yuffie leaned back in her chair and watched her girlfriend wash the 
dishes. Unlike Olette, she had the previous night well-burned into her memory and started to 
grin while looking at her back. She hadn't been that happy in a long time. Maybe she could 
get Olette to try some exotic clothes at the market.</p><p align='center'>---Valiant 
Hearts---</p><p>“I'm not gonna wear this. It's basically see-through.” Olette complained and 
put a piece of cloth that was supposed to be a dress back onto the stall. Completely 
ignoring Yuffie, she walked away and looked at another stall that sold necklaces and rings. 
One particular ring got her attention and she tried it on. It fit perfectly, like it was 
made for her. A black ring with two white dolphins on it. Reading the price tag, Olette 
smiled. Fifty Munny wasn't that much.</p><p>“You like that one?” Yuffie caught up and was 
looking at the ring. Yuffie took another one, one of the same kind but with a different 
animal on it and put it on. A crow. “Now that fits.” Giggling and deciding to keep her ring, 
she paid the old man that owned the stall the fifty Munny and turned around. Yuffie grabbed 
her wrist and held her back for a moment.</p><p>“Can you lend me fifty Gil?” Yuffie asked 
and looked a bit embarrassed. She had blown all her money on the trip, so she was pretty 
much broke.</p><p>“Fifty what?” Olette knew that Yuffie was asking for fifty Munny, but what 
in the world were Gil?</p><p>“Gil is just what we used to call Munny. I don't remember why 
we stopped calling it Gil, though.” Yuffie shrugged and looked with an asking gaze at 
Olette.</p><p>“Fine. You paid for all of this, after all.” Handing over the money, Yuffie 
paid the stall owner who showed a wide smile.</p><p>The afternoon was one big shopping 
event. Olette purchased a big straw hat and wanted to get a few other things, but they ran 
out of money after eating some ice cream and having a traveling painter paint a portrait of 
them together. When they finally got back to their house, it was already dusk and the moon 
was visible, floating far above them.</p><p>Yuffie stopped on the little balcony that was 
right on ground level and held Olette back, pulling her towards the big wooden swing that 
was right next to the wall. Yuffie's intent was very clear and Olette pulled away. The weird 
feeling from that morning was still there. It wasn't a bad feeling, it just didn't want to 
go away. It wasn't like she didn't want to sleep with Yuffie at all…it was more a feeling 
that she didn't want to do it right <i>now</i>.</p><p>“Did I do something wrong?” Yuffie 
couldn't think of any other way to ask in the spur of the moment.</p><p>“No. I just have 
this weird feeling…I don't want to…” Olette blushed a bit and turned around, still shy about 
it, “… sleep with you when I don't know what it is. I just can't get in the mood, I'm 
sorry.”</p><p>Olette sighed and knew how hard that must sound. But she didn't want to lie to 
Yuffie about this. That would only make it worse if she found out somehow.</p><p>Olette 
didn't hear an answer for some time and was afraid of turning around, in case Yuffie was 
really angry now. But when the black-haired girl laid both arms around her waist, she knew 
that wasn't the case. “I'm not forcing you to. But you still have to sleep in the same bed I 
do. No buts.”</p><p>Yuffie was smiling, but Olette couldn't see it. It hurt a bit that 
Olette was pulling away like this. But at least she was being honest with her. Yuffie 
couldn't tell if she would've done the same. Probably not, in fear of losing 
Olette.</p><p>“No groping,” Olette said, happy that Yuffie wasn't angry. Happiness turned 
into anger after the hands of the ninja moved up quite a bit, doing exactly what Olette had 
just prohibited Yuffie from doing.</p><p>“I'll let it pass. Only this one time. If you do it 
again, I'm going to kick you out of bed,” Olette said, looking over her shoulder into the 
black eyes of her girlfriend and kissing her softly. Yuffie took her hands back and sighed. 
They hadn't gone swimming all day and it didn't look like they were going now, either. They 
would leave tomorrow evening, so she had to get Olette to go swimming the next 
morning.</p><p>“Can we eat dinner before we go to sleep? I'm starving. We have so much 
leftover food in the fridge, we won't be able to eat all that till tomorrow evening. What a 
waste,” Yuffie complained, and let go of Olette, leaning on the house wall, looking to the 
dark ocean.</p><p>“I ruined the mood. I'll make something special as an apology. Don't 
expect too much, and don't dare expect me to make it often. It's a lot of work!” Olette 
said, and gave Yuffie a warning glare. If she didn't appreciate this, Olette would punish 
her.</p><p>“I'm already looking forward to it. You've gotten a lot better of the past month, 
really. I like your food a lot,” Yuffie said and smiled. “I'll wait outside. It's nice and 
warm and I don't want to spoil myself for what you're cooking.”</p><p>With a shrug, Olette 
went inside and started preparing immediately. It wasn't all that special, really, but it 
really was a lot of work. She had once asked Fun to teach her how to do it and she had 
practiced a lot until she was finally able to make it taste good. You took several 
ingredients and cut them into pieces, then some meat that was cooked simply. No steak or 
thick meat. All of that went into a big pot. There was luckily one of these in the house, 
but it was probably usually used for something else.</p><p>The cutting and slicing took some 
time, and when Olette was about to put everything in the pot, she caught Yuffie looking 
through the window. When she sent a grim glare towards the window, Yuffie vanished 
instantly.</p><p>“Not spoiling herself, my ass. She can't even wait an hour.” Olette sighed 
and continued on.</p><p>The hotpot, as it was called, was almost done when Yuffie burst in 
with growling stomach. “Isn't it done yet? I'm going to starve to death at this 
rate!”</p><p>“We can eat outside. You eat this stuff right out of the pot, and we need to 
cook it over a fire, too. The oven here is too small, so we're gonna have to make a fire. 
You go and make one, I'll get us some forks… unless you want to eat with your fingers. I'd 
dare you to do that, though.” Olette carried the heavy pot over to the table and put it 
down.</p><p>Minutes later, after Yuffie had probably broken every record for making a fire, 
they put the pot on top of a ring of rocks with the fire below. It was usually mainly 
vegetables in a hotpot, but neither of them was a big fan of those, so Olette had put in 
mainly meat.</p><p>“Where did you learn to make this?” Yuffie pressed out between chewing 
big slices of meat. “Who taught you? This stuff is really good. And it's nice to eat like 
this too.” Yuffie smiled and looked towards the sky. The moon was shining down on them and 
if not for her poor manners, it would've been a really romantic atmosphere.</p><p>“If you 
weren't such a barbarian, this would be really romantic,” Olette complained, 
sighing.</p><p>“I'm sorry for just being myself.” Yuffie started to pout and stuck her 
tongue at Olette.</p><p>“You two really make an odd couple. How did the surfing go?” The 
blond woman named Quistis was approaching them from Yuffie's side. A bit behind her was the 
guy that had driven the car, Zell.</p><p>“Not too bad. We lost a lot of time, though. We're 
going back tomorrow evening.” Olette said, and moved closer to Yuffie, making space for the 
two guests. She didn't mind since they had helped them a lot. And there was enough food 
anyway.</p><p>“How did your search go?” Olette asked. Yuffie looked a bit curious. She 
must've missed that the first time they had met.</p><p>“Nothing. We're not even sure they 
are in this world. They could be anywhere. Even…well…” Quistis' face became a little bit 
depressed. Olette knew what she meant. They could be dead. But Olette didn't hope so. They 
were nice people and she hoped for them to find their friends soon.</p><p>“I'm sure they're 
alive and kicking. Can't imagine them dead. Not him. He was already dead once and he came 
back,” Zell said, and sat down across from Yuffie.</p><p>Quistis sat down next to him and 
gave him a slap on the back of his head. “Don't bother them with those 
stories.”</p><p>Olette giggled and Yuffie looked a bit confused, but decided to not ask 
questions. If Olette didn't want them to know that they were lovers on a trip, then she 
wouldn't talk unnecessarily and blow their cover.</p><p>“Where are you going next?” Olette 
asked, and started questioning herself how they would even get to other worlds without a 
Keyblade.</p><p>“Mountain region to the south, Flutzorn Mountains. From there on…I don't 
know, but probably the forests of D'uhnas,” Quistis explained, and pointed each time in the 
respective direction.</p><p>“That's a long way. I hope you find them soon. If you want, you 
can eat with us. We have too much to eat all of it alone.”</p><p>Zell immediately jumped up 
and shouted “Yeah!” only to get hit by Quistis.</p><p>“Well, if you have enough, I think we 
can eat with you, just a little bit.” Quistis apparently was a very polite person who didn't 
want to be a burden to someone else.</p><p>“We'll go to bed. I want to get up early 
tomorrow. Yuffie, come on, stop stuffing yourself. You're gonna get fat,” Olette said, stood 
up and left. Zell and Quistis were left behind.</p><p>“They're nice girls, lettin' us eat 
this stuff, right, Quisty?” Zell proceeded to continue where Yuffie left off and munched 
away.</p><p>Quistis smiled and looked at the ground. The way they had looked at each other 
had been suspicious from the start. Not to mention the fact that they didn't wear surfer 
clothes or have any surfboards with them. Quistis smiled again. Those two were a couple, no 
mistaking it. Helping herself to some of the food, she kept quiet. It wouldn't help to tell 
Zell.</p><p align='center'>---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>The next day wasn't anything special. 
They had breakfast as usual, and they went for a swim afterwards. The evening came much too 
quickly, most likely due to the fact that they had slept until noon. The train was already 
waiting when they arrived at the station.</p><p>“If we miss our stop this time I'm going 
to―” Olette couldn't finish. The train made a loud noise and the announcement that it would 
leave any second was made. Yuffie pulled the bag and Olette with her and made it barely in 
time. The door closed right behind them.</p><p>“We made it. Phew.” Yuffie took a deep breath 
and started to look for their places. They had to go through four cabins until they found 
them. Sitting down, they watched the sunset from the window.</p><p>“Thanks,” Olette said 
after some time. They had spent their time looking out of the window, enjoying the 
scenery.</p><p>“What for? And what brought this on?” Yuffie was confused.</p><p>“You took me 
in. Helped me out. Were there for me. You took me with you on this trip…and…well…I'm really 
happy things are working out this nicely between us.” Olette smiled, unable to look in 
Yuffie's face.</p><p>“You're really an idiot, aren't you? You were there for me as well, and 
I'm happy that we're going out too,” Yuffie said, embarrassed. “But…you're welcome. Look, 
the sun is setting…”</p><p>Yuffie was no good with these things and wanted to change the 
topic. It was really obvious that she was tired, and this time Yuffie leaned onto Olette, 
resting her head on her shoulder.</p><p>It was a beautiful view. The sun was slowly 
descending into the shadows beneath the horizon, setting the sky ablaze with red light. It 
was a marvelous sight, like an eternal fire was consuming the world.</p><p>They would soon 
encounter a fire that was much different from the sunset.</p>
