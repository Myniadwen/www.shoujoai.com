<h1>Valiant Hearts II (part 1 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kinghart/index.html">Kingdom Hearts</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yuritale.html">Yuritale</a><br> </h2>
<p align='center'><I>The
Voice I Can Hear </I></P><P>It
was a dark room of immeasurable scale in which an entity with a black
robe stood. Nothing was there. At least, nothing the eyes of any
creature living under the lights could have seen. There was an
unknown sensation about it, something that would give you a terrible
feeling.</P><P>A
low sound made its way to the hall as a being, familiar to the other,
entered it, walking slowly to the one who was already standing in the
middle of it. They faced each other, not saying a word or making a
single noise. Just standing there in , the one that had
been in the hall all along made the first move.</P><P>“Speak,
Demyx. How are the preparations going?”</P><P>He
had a cold and emotionless voice, a sound that would make one feel
ill. It was clearly a male voice, the kind one really didn't want to
meet in a dark alley.</P><P>The
man continued to stand there, waiting for the other to answer. He
didn't have to wait too long.</P><P>“It's
still going according to our plan. There is nothing to worry about.
However, Marluxia seems to guess we're aware of his betrayal.”</P><P>The
second man's voice was all but cold and emotionless. It had a trace
of fear and subservience to it, but it was also clearly a male one.
It was softer and most likely younger than the first.</P><P>There
was a short pause. It was as if the first man was torn between simply
accepting the fact and giving praise to the man for his actions.</P><P>Whatever
his choice could have been, they were interrupted by yet another
entity in black robes. Unlike the man who had entered moments ago, he
came running in the hall, calling out alarming news.</P><P>“We
have been found out. A spy, most likely from that cursed Hollow
Bastion, has been sighted as she left this world.”</P><P>And
so, for the first time, the first man moved. He pointed at the one
that last came in, and spoke again. A commanding voice shook the
hall, a voice which one would not dare to object with.</P><P>“Tell
Xigbar to initiate Plan Herax II. Do it now! And send me Marluxia. We
will use this opportunity to get rid of all obstacles once and for
all. I will not tolerate any further failures!”</P><P>Quietly
obeying, the two that had been commanded to search for the spy just
stood there for a moment, then vanished into the darkness. The first
of the three did not. He was still standing in the Hall, trying to
suppress his rage and erase his doubts.</P><P>How
could they have been so lax about their security?</P><P>“How
did that damned spy get in anyway? What could she have seen? Nothing
of importance, right? Nothing I should worry about. It will not
influence our plan in the slightest.”</P><P>He
was sure. Made himself believe that nothing went wrong. It was just a
little unimportant flaw in their security. Nothing mentionable.
Nothing at all.</P><P>But
he could not have been more wrong.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>The
Castle of Hollow Bastion, one of the worlds that Kairi would never
forget. It was here she found out that it was Ansem of the Heartless
that had abducted her childhood friends, Sora and Riku. It was here
that Sora and Riku sacrificed themselves to protect Kingdom Hearts.
Again she was all alone, the Chosen One of the Keyblade, again on a
journey to find them.</P><P>“Sora...Riku...I
swear by my life that I will find you.”</P><P>The
battles were hard, and she hadn't been able to save all the worlds
that had been consumed by the Heartless and the Darkness. Not even
the sealing of Kingdom Hearts had restored some worlds that had been
completely absorbed by the Darkness.</P><P>However,
currently being in Hollow Bastion, and hoping that some of its
inhabitants heard some news, Kairi spent her days mostly in
dispirited boredom. No question, the Heartless weren't beaten at all.
They were still out there. Somewhere. And along with them, Sora and
Riku, unable to escape from the Darkness. But there was no sense in
just blindly traveling worlds and looking for them. There were just
too many worlds out there, and not even half of them had ever even
heard of the Heartless.</P><P>“Don't
make such a face, Kairi.”</P><P>A
young girl, probably not much older than Kairi herself, with black
hair, wearing a pair of short trousers of a faint green color, a
black vest and knee-length boots, was trying to cheer her up.</P><P>“You
know I don't like sitting around and doing nothing, Yuffie.”</P><P>“That's
why I'm saying you shouldn't make such a face. I have some hot news
for you! I'll tell you as soon as everyone's gathered. We're only
missing Tifa. She is probably off somewhere searching for Cloud
again, to make him actually do his job for a change.”</P><P>Kairi's
blue eyes went wide. Yuffie had been on some information-collecting
missions, and it seemed like she finally managed to dig up some
interesting material. Kairi stood up, anticipating hearing the news
that the self-proclaimed ninja had found. However, Yuffie was holding
back, much to the annoyance of the Keyblade-wielding girl. She had no
choice but to wait until everyone was gathered at Merlin's house,
which the group, composed of the few close friends Kairi had, used
often as meeting point.</P><P>Almost
an hour later, all of the people necessary had been found. Yuffie,
much to her liking, was the center of attention. She stood up and
started reporting.</P><P>“You
all know that keyhole portal way down in the canyon and how it was
blocked? Well, Cid has finally managed to unlock the block and after
a short discussion with Squ—”</P><P>A
cough came from a man with a leather jacket, armed with a gunblade
and dressed almost entirely in black. He gave an icy look to the spy
for a moment, then let the girl continue with her report.</P><P>“And
after a short discussion with Leon,
I got permission to enter the portal. You absolutely won't believe
what I found there. It was a downright gigantic complex of buildings,
with a very impressive skyscraper as its center. It was all white
and—”</P><P>This
time, a brown-haired woman dressed in pink and with a red ribbon in
her hair addressed the girl. “Yuffie, you know I really like to
hear you describing other worlds, but we all know it's probably a
very fascinating place. What we want to hear is what you found there
that's so important.”</P><P>The
reporting girl sighed and continued, leaving out all the additional
information and getting straight to the point. Yuffie didn't like
this sort of report, but there was no point in defying Aerith. She
always won an argument with her kind yet determined nature.</P><P>“It
seems it's not related to the Heartless at all and—”</P><P>The
next disruption came from Kairi. Discouraged that this may not
contain any clue about her friends, the Keybladress was about to
leave the gathering, but was held back by Aerith. The older woman
placed her hands on the shoulders of the red-haired girl. “Don't be
rude. Just because it is not related to the Heartless doesn't mean
there is no point in listening to it.”</P><P>Kairi
nodded and got her hopes a bit up. She would listen to Yuffie's
report, no matter how meaningless the outcome might be. What harm
could it do, anyway?</P><P>“As
I was saying, it seems it's not related to the Heartless but to a new
species, something I haven't seen ever before. We all know the
Heartless don't think or feel emotions, nor are they really smart or
anything of that sort. These beasts are different. They're white,
more silver-like, and seem intelligent, maybe even able to follow
strategic rules! I somehow managed to get away without a scratch over
the roof of a nearby building. There was only a small number of them
and none of them was able to fly. Quite a few of those things were
holding weapons. From the roof, I had a better view.”</P><P>Yuffie
made a short break, not looking so cheerful anymore. The following
was certainly nothing pleasant.</P><P>“Someone
is building an army of those things there. I saw hundreds, thousands.
Although most of them seemed to be of the weakest kind, it was a
really fearsome view. I've only seen that many Heartless once, and
that was when Hollow Bastion was taken over.”</P><P>She
took a moment to look around at the other's reactions to what she had
said. An army of never before seen creatures in a nearby world with
an unblocked keyhole portal had quite an impact on the people
present. While Cid and Leon started talking about how to best to seal
the keyhole for now, Tifa was mumbling something about Cloud, and
Aerith just seemed to quietly think about it. Kairi, though, seemed
abruptly interested in those enemies. Yuffie fake-coughed a bit to
bring everyone's attention back to her. “I’m not done yet. The
real breaking news is still to be revealed.”</P><P>All
eyes were glued on her. With a smirk on her face, the black-haired
girl continued once again.</P><P>“I
was thinking about finding out who is building and collecting those
creatures. It was a real hassle to get in, you know. I had to evade a
lot of traps, and that one time, I even—”</P><P>A
simultaneous “Yuffie!” wound through the room from her audience.
Again disrupted, the smirk vanished, and with a sulking face, the
ninja continued.</P><P>“However,
I made it in, and found myself on the third balcony of a REALLY big
hall, completely wrapped in pitch black darkness. First I thought
there wasn't anything of interest there, but I had somehow a hunch
that there WAS something, so I waited a bit. And for real, after just
a moment, there was someone coming...I hid myself between two pillars
on the edge of the balcony and waited.</P><P>“First
off, nothing happened. My eyes had adjusted to the darkness by that
time and I could see that there were TWO people in black robes. The
one must have stood in the hall the entire time I was there! One of
them started to speak, calling the other Demyx and asking how the
preparations for 'the plan' were going. The other said it was all
going according to plan. Then both of them just stood there, saying
nothing. I was thinking of getting closer, but since they just
continued to stand there, I left the balcony the same way I came in,
and got back here in one piece.”</P><P>Ending
her report, Yuffie looked directly to Leon and said, “That's all.”
She took her seat.</P><P>For
a few seconds, the garage was as quiet as the night. They just looked
at each other until Leon stood up and looked at the girl that just
had delivered the report.</P><P>“Good
work. There is no question that those people are planning something
dangerous. We need more information to take countermeasures, and—"
He was interrupted by Kairi, with whom Aerith seemed to be having
problems holding back. Kairi was kind of furious. The only thing she
could think of at that very moment was getting to this new world and
finding out if there were any clues regarding Sora and Riku.</P><P>“I'll
go! I'll be okay, even with those new enemies! I've always managed to
get back in one piece, haven't I?”</P><P>Leon
sighed and sat down. If the Chosen One of the Keyblade really wanted
to go, he couldn't really order her to sit around and do nothing. He
didn't have that kind of authority. However, a glance at Aerith's
expression told him that there wasn't much of a choice. He sighed
again. It was a bad habit to sigh at any given opportunity. He went
over to lay a hand on Kairi's shoulder. He couldn't possibly let her
go alone.</P><P>“Didn't
you hear Yuffie? A whole legion of those new monsters is sitting
there probably waiting for you to show up! We can't afford to let the
Chosen of the Keyblade go all alone. I just can't believe that you
know what you're doing in your current mental state.”</P><P>After
a glare from Aerith and seeing the wild determination in Kairi's
eyes, he let out another sigh and eventually gave up.</P><P>“I
think it's okay if we all go together to that place. However, I won't
allow you to go wild and just run away from the group no matter what
we find there or what we see. After all, you're still just a
sixteen-year-old girl and—”</P><P>Tifa,
a black-haired woman who specialized in martial arts and was dressed
in black shorts and a black top, stood up, walked over to Leon and
slapped him so hard that he was covering his cheek with a hand,
looking quite surprised. The sound of a loud slap rang through the
whole garage.</P><P>Tifa
was evidently quite angry. All eyes went to her and Leon as the woman
started to address the man with a big scar across his face with quite
a disrespectful tone.</P><P>“This
very same sixteen-year-old girl has saved yours, ours, and the
world's asses quite excellently, don't you think? It's a hundred
years too early for you, or any of us, to belittle her!”</P><P>With
that, the really mad woman walked out of the room, leaving the
remaining people in an awkward silence.</P><P>The
first to speak was Aerith. She went over to Leon and knelt down as
she treated his pain with a vita spell.</P><P>“I
don't agree with the manner in which she said it, but I do agree with
what Tifa said, Leon. It's really a bit rude for you to address her
that way. After all, we'd still be playing hide and seek with the
Heartless in Traverse Town if it weren't for her.”</P><P>Standing
up, turning at the other people, Aerith continued. “I also think
Leon has a point when he says that it is too dangerous to let Kairi
go alone. We should all go. I just don't want to sit around, doing
nothing but waiting when I could fight. We all could. I'm sure that
is also what Tifa is thinking.”</P><P>At
the very same moment Aerith had finished speaking, Tifa came back
into the room, pointing her fist at Leon to give off a final warning.</P><P>“It's
exactly like Aerith says. I don't want to see Kairi hurt anymore. And
Leon, if you value your health, you better not address Kairi in such
a poor manner again. She is like a daughter for me, and I don't think
you have any right to say things like that to her.”</P><P>Tifa
wasn't in a good mood and ran off again, this time mumbling something
about finding Cloud to join the group for this mission.</P><P>The
man with the gunblade just nodded and sighed, making a mental note to
never again speak ill of Kairi when Tifa was present. He preferred
his bones to be in one piece. This wasn't really his day.</P><P>Tifa
was just about to leave the residential quarters when she stopped.
She hadn't been on very good terms with Aerith lately, and her sudden
leave wouldn't make it any better. They had one argument after
another, and most of them just because Tifa didn't agree with
Aerith's education method regarding Kairi.</P><P>However,
it couldn't continue that way. She had really got to love Aerith over
the past year and couldn't accept that it would end like this. Aerith
loved spicy food, although they had it only on rare occasions because
Kairi absolutely loathed it.</P><P>“I
guess Kairi has to live with it for today. I don't want to sleep on
the couch anymore and it has been over a week since we...“ Tifa
didn't finish that sentence and slightly blushed instead for a moment
before she ran off. Cloud would not skip this trip because he was a
good fighter, even when he was a horrible human.</P><P>Taking
Aerith's words as the conclusion of this meeting, everyone slowly
left. Cid remained until the end, since he used this house as his
laboratory anyway. He had to prepare...things for the upcoming trip
to the world with the new enemy, and he didn't like when someone was
playing peeping tom when he was working. Just a moment before Leon
left, Cid addressed him, making the man stop for a moment.</P><P>“This
could get pretty dangerous. It's been quite a while since I've had a
lance in my hands, you know?”</P><P>Leon
just nodded, not knowing what calamity they’d gotten themselves
into.</P><P>The
days went by at a lightning speed; the date for the raid on 'The
World That Never Was' was coming closer with each hour. Everybody was
restless and busy with preparations, especially Kairi, who hadn't
stopped training for nearly the entire time. If Aerith hadn't been
looking after her, she would have probably even skipped sleep.</P><P>Aerith
had always cared the most about the Chosen One of the Keyblade. Her
and Tifa. It was a bit embarrassing for Kairi, but those two were
like parents for the young girl. It was a bit of an open secret that
they found themselves in some sort of romantic relationship after
adapting to the role of parents for her.</P><P>“You

<I>will</I> break if you don't <B>take</B> a break, Kairi. I know
you're eager to look for your friends, but it won't do you any good
if you collapse from being overworked.”</P><P>“I...know.
But I just can't get myself go to sleep when I know that I might be
about to find some important clue about how to rescue Sora and Riku.”</P><P>Her
eyes were shadowed from a lack of sleep, and she really didn't look
all that good. There was no question that the few last nights had
been restless ones.</P><P>Aerith
took her adoptive daughter by the hand, dragging the red-haired girl
along with her. Kairi really didn't have the power to resist anymore
since she had been training day and night with only little to no time
for rest.</P><P>“You
need a break from this. Even if you were chosen by the Keyblade, you
can’t train nonstop day and night. You'll be exhausted to no end by
the time we enter that place.”</P><P>Kairi
had to kind of agree with this. Now that she had finished practicing,
her own boundaries were becoming apparent. Sudden exhaustion seized
her mind, making her feel dizzy.</P><P>The
brown-haired woman had dragged her along to where she, Tifa and Kairi
were living. Initially, the young girl had no place to go since her
family had moved to the Destiny Islands, and living all alone in the
castle was out of the question for a sixteen-year-old girl. Kairi had
wanted, deep in her heart, to go back to her real family, but she
would only bring danger upon them if she returned there.</P><P>Instead
of living alone, Aerith said she would take her in. After a few
months of just those two living there, Tifa had had a huge argument
with Cloud and the black-haired woman left the apartment that she had
shared with him. The blond man had continued his journey to find his
archnemesis, Sephiroth, so he could settle things with him once and
for all.</P><P>Tifa,
though, had asked Aerith to let her move into the same house. Living
with Cid or Leon was out of the question for her, and Yuffie was way
too energetic for Tifa's tastes. The calmer woman didn't really have
any objections, though, and just like that, matters were settled, and
she moved in to live with Kairi and Aerith.</P><P>Tifa
wasn't at home and Kairi sat down on a chair, now feeling extremely
worn out. She stretched out her legs and arms and let the Keyblade
return to the shape of a key ring pendant.</P><P>“I
wonder if we'll find anything useful,” sighed the girl as she
closed her eyes. Really hating to be like that -complaining and
unconfident- but unable to do anything about it, another small sigh
escaped her lips.</P><P>Aerith,
however, went upstairs and left Kairi alone. It didn't take more than
just a few minutes before the redhead dozed off, lying halfway on the
table, quietly sleeping.</P><P>That
was, until Tifa came in. She was in a mood that could only be
described as something like Wild Animal Rage. She slammed the door
hard enough to startle Kairi, who summoned her Keyblade Oathkeeper
and faced the black-haired woman for a moment, ready to attack in
case she was an enemy—until she recognized that it was only Tifa,
who had almost broken the door.</P><P>“Wow,
Kairi. You're looking terrible. Did Cid test some new robot on you?”
asked Tifa, looking a bit worried.</P><P>If
Kairi was here, Aerith must be too. Which would mean...the woman
sighed.</P><P>“Tifa
Lockheart!” The pink-dressed woman came down the stairs, pointed a
finger at the now not-so-raging-anymore woman, and followed with the
sermon that she had heard at least a million times before—not to
slam the door.</P><P>“Okay,
okay, Aerith, I get it. I get it already, damn it! I didn't know
Kairi was here!" answered Tifa as she looked at Kairi with eyes
that asked for nothing but help.</P><P>The
two women were a really good pairing until it came to matters that
affected Kairi. While Aerith was a bit overprotective, Tifa
encouraged Kairi to work on her skills with the Keyblade, which lead
to Kairi being a bit of a tomboy.</P><P>The
girl stood up and gave both of them a 'Stop it, both of you, now!'
glare. This worked every time, although neither of them liked when
Kairi did it. A bit annoyed, and really tired, Kairi went upstairs to
her room, leaving both Aerith and Tifa alone.</P><P>Left
alone with her thoughts, Kairi fell on her bed and stared at the
ceiling.</P><P>Tomorrow
was the date for the trip. Everyone had prepared themselves as much
as possible.</P><P>They
wouldn't take any casualties.</P><P>Not
anymore.</P><P>“I'll
protect them. I'm not the Chosen of the Keyblade for nothing.” And
with that in mind, Kairi fell asleep again, too tired to even take
off her clothes and change into something more comfortable.</P><P>Her
dreams were always a mess, but this time they were downright
unnatural. Instead of the usual darkness and Sora and Riku, there was
nothing but white light around her. No voices of her friends, no
Heartless that engulfed them, nothing at all. It was just plain white
and bright.</P><P>“This
is the weirdest dream I've ever had,” Kairi decided as she looked
around.</P><P>Slowly,
her eyes adjusted to the bright light, and she found herself in a
room that was completely white. A big table, walls without anything
on them, and a few chairs that were also white was all that
surrounded her and filled the room.</P><P>“Whose
room is this?” asked Kairi out loud. It was not like there was
anyone there to answer the question, but she had the feeling that it
was better than just wondering.</P><P>Deep
in her subconscious, a voice was saying “My own,” but that
couldn't possibly be true. She had never seen this room before.</P><P>Kairi
moved abruptly around 180° degrees as she sensed someone.
Some...thing...was there. It was unable to say what it was at all, or
if it was even dangerous, but it did clearly emit a message.</P><P>Kairi
could...feel that something was trying to grab her hand, to drag her
away. Instantly, a voice drove into her head, and she could hear the
agony in it.</P><P>“<I>Help
me...please!” </I></P><P>Drenched
in sweat, Kairi woke up, breathing heavily and looking around. It was
very late at night and pitch black in her room. “That was a bit too
realistic for a dream...”</P><P>Her
room wasn't really all that stuffy—a wardrobe, although most of her
clothes looked just the same, a computer on a table, and a bit of
decoration. Nothing much, but she felt at home here. Quietly opening
the door, Kairi snuck to the stairs, looking down. The lights were
off, so Tifa and Aerith must have already gone to bed.</P><P>Well,
that was to be expected. The young girl decided to just sleep a bit
more, feeling still exhausted.</P><P>“A
bit more can't hurt...it's not like I would get away lightly if they
caught me, going to practice in the middle of the night...”</P><P>Back
in her room, she changed into something more comfortable—a white
shirt from Tifa, long enough to cover her to almost the knees, and
went to bed.</P><p align='center'>--Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>In
an entirely different place, evil plans were put into action.</P><P>“Did
we hide everything thoroughly enough?” A man with blond hair and a
friendly expression asked another that had an eyepatch and gray hair.
Both were wearing black robes. They must have been related to the
unknown silver monsters.</P><P>The
one with the eyepatch just nodded and started to smirk. “We'll use
this to expose all of the traitors inside the Organization. Marluxia
and his pawns will face their end defending this deserted place,
believing we are still in the dark about their plans.” His voice
was like poison, sharp and evil. There was no doubt that they had
caught knowledge of what Hollow Bastion was planning.</P><P>The
blond shrugged and looked at the ground. It wasn't his style to let
others do his work, but in this case, it was an order directly from
him. There was no choice but to obey if he didn't want to be one of
the ones left behind to die in this worthless place.</P><P>“Let's
go. I actually don't want to be here when the horde from Hollow
Bastion invades this place. I really doubt Marluxia will stand a
chance. It'll be like five versus...how many are there? Well, it
doesn't really matter. Even if Marluxia wins through some miracle,
there's—”</P><P>The
blond moved around, thinking he had heard something. He then put up
his hood and vanished into the darkness. After a short while and
without comment, the other followed him.
