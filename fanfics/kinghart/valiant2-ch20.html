<h1>Valiant Hearts II (part 20 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kinghart/index.html">Kingdom Hearts</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yuritale.html">Yuritale</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kinghart/valiant2-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><p style="text-align:center;"><i>So Long Ago – Alone With Despair</i></p><p>Two days had 
passed since the Heartless attacked Hollow Bastion. Kairi had been treated multiple times by 
Rydia. Naminé and Aerith had woken up, but they were still suffering from massive headaches 
and exhaustion. Tifa was still bedridden, and even though she could spend most of her time 
with Aerith this way, she was still quite moody.</p><p>Kairi was sitting in the living room, 
<i>trying</i> to read a book, but it was nearly impossible with all the noise inside her 
head. A lot of things were going through her mind and she wasn't exactly in the condition to 
handle any of them. The worst was that she knew she had to go and see Olette and clear 
things between them before the next mission came. And according to Leon, that would be 
soon.</p><p>“Rydia, I'm going out for a while. If Naminé asks where I am, tell her I'll be 
back soon,” Kairi told the green-haired woman who was standing in the kitchen, trying to 
cook. She made amazing coffee, but she was a terrible cook.</p><p>“Okay. Will you be back 
for dinner? I'm making rice omelet. I got a recipe from Yuffie the other day and wanted to 
try it out.” Rydia was a bright woman, but when it came to her shortcomings, namely cooking, 
she was just as naïve as Naminé was, if not even more so. Other than that, she was a very 
capable woman and a really powerful sorceress.</p><p>Looking at the…battlefield that was the 
kitchen, Kairi decided that Yuffie's recipe combined with Rydia's cooking skills might be 
enough to kill a zombie. She waved her hand, smiled for a second and left, unable to tell 
the nice girl that her food was almost always inedible.</p><p>Standing outside, fresh air 
confronted her and cleared her thoughts somewhat. As she looked in the direction of the 
destroyed district, she sighed. What if such an attack happened again? Next time they might 
not be this lucky. They needed all the manpower they could get and Olette was a important 
asset to the group. For the girls to let their personal affairs get in the way and influence 
their teamwork negatively was unacceptable. It could cost lives the next time.</p><p>As 
Kairi walked down the street to Yuffie's apartment, a dozen possible scenarios shot through 
her mind, all likely and all without a nice outcome for her. Kairi knew Olette was angry 
about her being with Naminé so shortly after she had rejected both of them, but what could 
she do? Break up with Naminé just so Olette could feel better? Naminé wouldn't be too happy 
about such a turn of events. Besides, Olette was now with Yuffie, and some time had passed. 
Things could go back to the way they were now.</p><p>“Kairi?”</p><p>Instantly drawn back to 
reality, Kairi looked up. Olette was standing there right before her, looking rather 
confused at the sudden encounter. “Shouldn't you be resting? Didn't you get 
injured?”</p><p>“I didn't know you were so worried about me,” Kairi answered in honest 
surprise.</p><p>“I…well, I think it's time to talk.” Looking at the ground, the brunette 
knew they couldn't continue like this. She didn't hate Kairi, and it made no sense to keep 
being angry and hurt about what happened. “Should we go to that one place?”</p><p>With a 
look at Kairi's legs, covered in bandages, Olette quickly took her comment back. “Never 
mind. How about The Kupo, that new café Stilzkin opened?”</p><p>“I'm not an invalid, Olette. 
But The Kupo sounds good,” Kairi replied and stood there, rooted to the ground for a few 
seconds. Both thought the other would take the first step. Kairi finally opened her mouth, 
closed it without saying anything, and walked in front of the brunette.</p><p>It was so 
awkward to talk to her after everything that had happened. And what should she say? Kairi 
knew she tended to over-analyze, and that Olette often acted on her emotions. They were like 
water and oil. But not so long in the past, Kairi had felt…differently about her. Right now, 
even though it was awkward, Kairi could see Olette not only as Keyblader or as a teammate 
but also as a friend she wanted back, and…</p><p>Kairi opened the door to the small café 
that was owned by Stilzkin, a rich Moogle, and that employed solely Moogles of all kinds. A 
cute little Moogle who introduced himself as Momo led them to a table and asked them for 
their orders.</p><p>Kairi let her eyes fly over the card and chose a light cappuccino that 
was named Kuporachino. Olette simply ordered black coffee, the strongest they had, and 
sighed. Now that the Moogle was gone and they had ordered, there was only one thing left to 
do.</p><p>“Can you start? I'm terrible at these things…” Olette said, and averted her eyes, 
fixating them on the table. She didn't feel so well. She hadn't spoken with Yuffie at all 
since they'd gotten back, and only came back to Yuffie's to sleep. What happened nagged at 
her consciousness, and nothing anyone said helped. She felt guilty for not being 
there.</p><p>“And I'm <i>not</i> terrible, right. But I'll start…I…well.” Taking a deep 
breath, Kairi gathered all of her courage. She needed it for what she wanted to say. This 
was harder than fighting the Heartless or the Organization. She couldn't just analyze the 
target and form a strategy. She had to be honest and talk.</p><p>“I want us to be friends 
again,” Kairi said, and before Olette could say anything, she lifted her hand and stopped 
the brunette. “Listen, I really do. I know you're angry about…Naminé and me. I admit, it's 
my fault. It just…happened. I don't know if it would've been the same if you had come to me 
instead of Naminé, but I think so. Maybe…I just needed to be cornered to accept that I can't 
hide from myself forever. I still feel guilty for what happened. Will you…forgive me?” Kairi 
felt sick after Olette kept silent when she finished her little speech. She had improvised, 
said what she thought, felt.</p><p>“You don't change, do you? But…” Olette said and took a 
sip from the freshly made coffee another Moogle had just brought up to them. “You're right. 
I want…to be your friend again. I hate being away from Naminé like this too.”</p><p>Olette 
hadn't felt this good since they'd gotten back. For the first time since she had seen that 
big dark cloud covering the skies on her way back, she smiled. That was a lot easier than 
she had thought. And Kairi seemed happy too.</p><p>“I also wanted to say…I'm sorry. That I 
wasn't there. I know that I now have a duty. I'm a Keyblader now. I'd hate to think it's my 
fault everything happened like that.” Olette took another sip of her coffee, her guts 
feeling even hotter than the black liquid. What if Kairi held her responsible for the 
mess?</p><p>“Even if you had been there, the only thing that would have changed is that 
Naminé and I would have gotten off a bit easier. But you'd be injured too then. Just…just be 
there the next time. I feel a lot safer with you covering my back,” Kairi answered. She took 
a large gulp of her Kuporachino.</p><p>“I will. Um…how…is Naminé doing?” Olette had missed 
the blond girl so much that she was eager to know when she could talk to her again. Ever 
since the events in Port Royal, she had felt a bit differently about Naminé. Not in a 
romantic way, but…they were closer than just good friends.</p><p>“Probably still sleeping. 
She is fine, but the magic exhaustion was severe. She'll have a headache at least for a few 
days.” Kairi looked out the window. Had it always been this easy to talk to people? Had she 
changed over the past few weeks? Changed due to Naminé and Olette?</p><p>“I hope she'll be 
better soon. Listen, I am really—”</p><p>Kairi cut her off before she could finish her 
sentence. “No matter how guilty you feel, it's in the past now. I'm happy we're not fighting 
anymore, so please, don't succumb to this feeling of guilt. I know what it feels like. 
Everything seems to be your fault. You think you could have made a difference. The sad truth 
is, one person alone makes only so much difference, even a Keyblader. Nobody thinks it's 
your fault. Nobody could have known the Heartless would attack us,” Kairi said, completely 
emotionless, fully knowing how hard it might sound. She had experienced this in the past, 
when she had lost yet another world to the Heartless.</p><p>“But—”</p><p>Kairi stopped her 
with a cold glare.</p><p>“I see. Thanks. I think…I feel a little bit better.” Olette emptied 
her coffee and then noticed something she should have thought about long 
ago.</p><p>“Kairi…do you have any money on you?” Olette was so embarrassed that she blushed. 
But she went from being embarrassed to panicked when Kairi widened her eyes and whispered 
that she thought Olette would have some money on <i>her</i>.</p><p>There they sat, without 
money to pay for their drinks.</p><p>Two hours, and many, many angry “kupos” later, the two 
girls left the shop, exhausted and not in the best mood.</p><p>“I can't believe they made us 
wash cups for two hours. We only had coffee!” Olette complained, rubbing her wrist. Her 
hands were sore and her back was killing her. Man, those Moogles could get really angry. 
Olette feared that the pompom of one of the kitchen helpers might explode when she had 
dropped a cup and it shattered all over the place.</p><p>Kairi was quiet for the longer part 
of the way back to the crossroads between the places they were staying at.</p><p>“It's good 
to…talk again to you. Listen, I was—” Olette almost stumbled over her own words.</p><p>“We 
both had a lot to deal with. Honestly, I'd like to forget about this. I'm happy you're 
talking to me again. Leon will send us on the next mission soon and I want you to brief me 
on your current skills. I will do the same for Naminé and me. I'm still our tactical 
coordinator and I need to know those things. Tomorrow, ten o'clock at the canyon?” Kairi 
wanted to be prepared for the next mission. She didn't want another catastrophe like the one 
with the man from the Organization from before.</p><p>“Still the over-analyzing thinker, are 
you? Some things never change. Okay, I'll be there. I, uh, might bring Yuffie along.” Olette 
said it without thinking. Why? She had no intention of bringing Yuffie to a training 
session, nor would the black-haired girl have any interest in that.</p><p>Kairi remained 
silent for a few seconds and then sighed. “Okay.” Was Olette really going to bring Yuffie 
along? If not, why did she say so? Just to tease her or to see how she'd 
react?</p><p>Turning around again, the brunette was already gone. She didn't want them to 
argue again. She would apologize tomorrow to her. It was barely evening, but she felt tired. 
Well, she still wasn't fully recovered.</p><p>After heading back home, Kairi spent the rest 
of the day next to Naminé, who told her a new story. She had taken the next step and instead 
of just reading, she was now sometimes telling her own stories, and even drew pictures of 
them sometimes.</p><p>Nothing significant happened for the rest of the day, except that 
Rydia virtually exploded a pot. Kairi was making dinner when the sun finally went down and 
nightfall came.</p><p>“You know, Rydia, I think Tifa has a secret crush on you. She'd never 
admit it, though. But watch out. You better not take a shower here.” Naminé was teasing the 
green-haired woman for fun.</p><p>“Why? You don't think she'd really…I mean, Aerith is still 
here and all.” Rydia seemed sort of threatened by that thought.</p><p>“Aerith is too tired 
for 'anything'. I can imagine it—you standing in the shower and then from behind, two large 
hands suddenly grab your—” Naminé had quite the colorful fantasy. To accompany her story, 
she made grabbing moves with her hands.</p><p>Covering her chest and blushing quite deeply, 
Rydia looked over her shoulder if Kairi was listening in. “I-I don't swing that way! She 
wouldn't…<i>really</i>…” Rydia couldn't bring herself to say it.</p><p>“Oh, I don't know. 
Tifa is always full of energy, and being forced to lie around doing nothing…” Naminé grinned 
widely and leaned forward as if to whisper something to Rydia. “I think she has a thing or 
two for sorceresses, especially if they are a bit smaller than her. In <i>many</i> ways.” 
Naminé had to force herself not to laugh when she saw Rydia's shocked face.</p><p>“You're 
kidding. Aren't you? Right? <i>Right?!</i>” Rydia was quite nervous and almost lost all 
poise when Kairi interrupted.</p><p>“I think Tifa asked for you earlier, Rydia. She didn't 
want me to tell you why, but she seemed really quirky about it.” Kairi had obviously 
listened to the whole thing. Poor Rydia was so gullible.</p><p>“I think I'm gonna go home.” 
Rydia was as pale as a ghost and almost tripped on her way to the door.</p><p>Kairi found it 
rather amusing to see how Rydia, the only straight woman in the house, reacted to those 
“threats.”</p><p>By the time the clock hit ten, Kairi was almost asleep. Almost. She still 
shared her bed with Naminé. She had thought about it. If this kept going on, why not have 
Naminé move into her room? She didn't own many things so there was enough space for the two 
of them. It was rather cramped in the bed, but apparently only Kairi minded that. Naminé 
loved to cuddle up to the redhead and sleep like that, her head resting on Kairi's 
chest.</p><p>“I wish we could stay like this forever,” Naminé whispered and her hand looked 
for Kairi's, their fingers entwining with each other's.</p><p>“Time never stands still. 
We're getting older too.” Kairi said, but still smiled. She enjoyed these moments of 
absolute peace and happiness together with Naminé.</p><p>“I know. But I still wish we 
could.” Naminé closed her eyes and fell silent. She had this rather annoying habit of 
falling asleep in the middle of a conversation.</p><p>“Silly,” Kairi whispered back, and 
petted the blonde's head. The stars out there seemed to shine just for the two of them. And 
with a last quiet sigh, Kairi fell asleep too.</p><p style="text-align:center;">---Valiant 
Hearts---</p><p>The next day only consisted of resting and preparing mentally for what was 
to come soon. Kairi was up and returned to what she did best—keeping her mind occupied with 
her destiny. Olette came over, and even though Kairi had expected her to bring Yuffie with 
her, she was alone. Naminé was supposed to stay in bed, but Kairi wanted her to hear 
everything, so she brought the blond girl into the living room not long before Olette was 
supposed to show up. It was not that she was embarrassed about having Naminé in her room. 
She just didn't want Olette to think she was showing off their relationship to 
her.</p><p>Olette and Naminé acted like they were glued together. They hadn't really seen or 
talked to each other in some time, and it was very obvious that they were happy to be back 
together as friends. Kairi sat comfortably on a chair across from the table while Olette 
told her the results of her training, where her limits were. Kairi had a lot to discuss, 
such as the use of Naminé's magic. Friendly fire had become a hot topic, simply because 
Naminé now had the power to use very high-level magic but not the strength to control 
it.</p><p>“I know that saying things like, 'I forbid you from using this and that under any 
circumstances' is foolish. I remember the feeling when we faced that member of the 
Organization. That was beyond anything I've ever experienced. Such a powerful killing 
intent…it reminded me of Ansem. Against such foes…we never know what we'll have to resort 
to, so I'd like to go over some advanced tactics with you two.”</p><p>Even though the girls 
sighed, Kairi continued. They would now work in formations, but only very few to start with. 
Olette and Naminé instantly objected to Kairi's names of the formations, but their 
objections were simply ignored.</p><p>One formation was meant to conserve Naminé's magical 
power. Olette and Kairi would provide protection for the magician. Another was for all-out 
combat, where the roles were equal, but Naminé would be using powerful magics while the 
other two stayed in close range, protecting her.</p><p>After a good two hours of explaining 
things and lots of questions, objections and nonsense, the heads of the three girls were 
smoking. It was almost time for dinner and Rydia had told Kairi that she couldn't find 
someone to fill in for her at the shop, so they had to cook themselves.</p><p>“I'm gonna 
make dinner now. Olette, are you staying?” Kairi had stood up and was already halfway over 
to the kitchen.</p><p>“No, Yuffie hates eating alone and I really should talk to her.” With 
a sad expression, Olette stood up, petted Naminé's head one last time, and left without 
another word.</p><p style="text-align:center;">---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>Back at Yuffie's 
apartment, Olette was in a completely different mood from before. She knew that every 
mission was dangerous, and the next one would be especially hard on her. She only had one 
meeting with Kairi about general tactics and she knew little about what Naminé and Kairi 
could do now. She had to be prepared. In many ways.</p><p>“Did something good happen? You 
look really happy.” Yuffie sat across the table and looked at a completely changed 
Olette.</p><p>“Yeah. I talked with Kairi and made up with her. And…Yuffie, I'm sorry I've 
been so distant the last few days, but I've had a lot of stuff to think about. It won't 
happen again.” Olette finished her food, stood up and stopped when she was standing behind 
Yuffie.</p><p>“It's about time you got better. I thought I'd die from lack of fun any day 
now. You were like a zombie. Including your face.” Yuffie teased the brunette and 
immediately saw her sulk.</p><p>“I met with Leon today. He said I should tell you the next 
mission starts tomorrow and that you should prepare yourself. I'm really pissed off that 
you're gone the moment you're better,” Yuffie said, but she really didn't feel pissed off at 
all.</p><p>“Tomorrow? Sometimes I think Leon is really a Heartless,” Olette said, and hugged 
Yuffie from behind, kissing her on the cheek.</p><p>“That…was a terrible pun…” Yuffie rolled 
her eyes and gave Olette a grim look. “Never do that again. You're a terrible, terrible 
comedian.” Looking to the side, Yuffie changed the kiss on the cheek into a full kiss. She 
felt a bit weird kissing her like this after the last few days, but that was only a 
temporarily feeling.</p><p>“Look who's talking. Any audience would lynch <i>you</i>.” Olette 
mocked her and let go, looking for a clock. Yuffie's apartment was as chaotic as ever and it 
took her a minute to find a working one. “It's past ten. I need to get up early tomorrow. 
Wanna go to bed? And I mean sleeping, not 'to bed'.” Olette gave Yuffie a glare that made it 
clear she was serious.</p><p>With a shrug, Yuffie followed Olette to the bedroom and 
undressed on her way. Seeing that, Olette groaned and looked to the ceiling. “I said 
<i>sleep</i><i>!</i>”</p><p>Yuffie only smiled and put her arms around Olette, pulling her 
towards the bed.</p><p>“I'm so screwed,” Olette said and let herself be pulled away.</p><p 
style="text-align:center;">---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>“I know you're not fully healed yet, 
but chances are that you won't encounter the enemy right away. That's why I can't send 
anyone else with you. Tifa and Aerith are still out of commission and we need everyone else 
here in case something comes up. I don't want you three to come back and find that your home 
is gone.” Leon was giving one of his “speeches” again. They were down in the abandoned 
district that had been an industrial park in the past, but due to technological advances, it 
was now empty and unused.</p><p>Kairi, Naminé and Olette were wrapped in long brown cloaks 
to protect against the heat of the desert and warm them in the cold nights in case they had 
to camp out. Beyond that, they were in only their normal clothes. Kairi wore a practical 
one-piece that allowed freedom, Olette trousers and a shirt to give her maximum mobility, 
and Naminé a dress that was light and did not distract her.</p><p>Their Keyblades summoned, 
they waited for Leon to give final instructions.</p><p>“Your mission is to track down 
whatever attacked us and eliminate it. If you are unable to do that, come back in three 
days. Be careful. Contact me if you find anything. If there is no contact after thirty-six 
hours, I will send Yuffie on a recon to look for you. If she can't detect you in two hours' 
time, I will have Cid force open the portal and have a search troop look for you. In your 
case, one world's balance is not as important as the greater goal.”</p><p>Kairi nodded. She 
knew that he was right. She did not like how blunt he was being, but he was right. Leon was 
kind of a superior, a teacher, to her and she believed in him and his ways.</p><p>Olette and 
Naminé stood respectively left and right to Kairi and nodded in synchrony.</p><p>“Take 
care,” Leon said, and took a few steps back.</p><p>Kairi nodded one last time. 
“Understood.”</p><p>Turning around, the redhead pointed Oathkeeper at the gateway to 
Agrabah. Olette and Naminé followed Kairi's example and directed their blades at the gate as 
well. Light was suddenly joining, binding together, flowing towards the invisible gateway 
beyond eye's grasp.</p><p>The second the light reached the portal, connected to it, Leon 
could sense that something had gone wrong. A fraction of a second later, he found himself 
instinctively taking cover.</p><p>The enormous explosion and the following shock wave hit 
Leon hard enough to nearly knock him out. With a last futile attempt, he crawled behind a 
wall and looked through the rift at the ground where the girls had stood.</p><p>There was 
nothing there. No blood, no bodies. It seemed untouched. In fact, nothing seemed physically 
damaged at all. Knowing that, Leon's eyes closed, and he finally lost consciousness.</p><p 
style="text-align:center;">---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>Blinding light. The feeling of being 
drawn apart, ripped in pieces, put back together differently from before—that process 
repeated indefinitely, sometimes in the fraction of a second, sometimes seemingly taking 
forever. Time stood still and flowed uncontrollably at the same time. Space warped, 
destroyed, reassembled, repaired—just to be destroyed again, just to be repaired again. An 
endless circle of destruction and insanity.</p><p>Infinite pain joined together with 
immeasurable pleasure, suddenly replaced by sickness, death and rebirth, a chaos of all 
emotions put together, all lived at once. Passing out, waking up, puking, coughing up blood, 
laughing, crying, screaming, all at once. The chill of death, the burning passion of life, 
the adrenaline of danger, the cold of failure.</p><p>Futilely reaching out with the 
Keyblade, something exploded in Kairi's head. Something changed, grabbed her, ripped her 
apart. Endless pain. Then, nothingness.</p><p>When she slowly opened her eyes, Kairi noticed 
she was lying facedown in sand. She tried to get up, but she was unable to, so she rolled 
over onto her side and started to throw up whatever was left in her stomach. She felt beyond 
terrible. Her skin was burning.</p><p>Kairi got on her knees and tried to slowly stand up, 
but she immediately fell down again. What was wrong? She could feel her body and nothing 
seemed to be broken.</p><p>Looking down at herself, Kairi's mind froze for a few seconds. 
What had happened? She didn't remember being this tall. She looked at her hands, then felt 
her own body with them. She grabbed at her hair, which was hanging down her back. She was 
finding it hard to breathe, and her feet hurt. One thousand small things she hadn't noticed 
before due to the adrenaline were becoming apparent.</p><p>“<i>Oathkeeper!</i>” Kairi said 
with an unfamiliar voice, and the white Keyblade appeared in her hand. At least this still 
worked. “<i>Blizzard!</i>” Kairi fired a salve of magic ice at the ground. It was shining, 
steaming in the heat, but it would do as mirror. Looking in it, she now knew what had 
happened to her.</p><p>“I'm…<i>older?</i>”</p><p>She was clearly herself—the eye color, hair 
color, and face structure were the same, but she looked much older than before. As she tried 
to calm down, the events from when the gateway seemingly exploded and sucked them in were 
coming back. But before she could get an answer, her body made it clear that this heat was 
poisonous for her. She coughed up more blood and crawled back to her knees, breathing 
heavily, almost in a panic.</p><p>“What in the world happened?” Kairi asked 
herself.</p><p>Was she in Agrabah? Taking a quick look around, Kairi couldn't tell. There 
were ruins of buildings all over the place. Red sand, like grainy blood, covered the ground. 
No wind, no sound. In the sky was a brightly shining red sun. This was clearly not Agrabah, 
but then…</p><p>Standing up, this time fully aware of her longer legs and larger body, Kairi 
stood without problems and made her way over to one of the larger ruins. Where were the 
others? She had to find them. But first, she had to do something about herself. Her hair had 
grown so long that it almost reached her ankles, and it was a huge hindrance. Using 
Oathkeeper as a means to an end, she grabbed her hair roughly at her shoulders' length and 
cut it off with one quick swipe. The red hair fell on the ground and remained there. Her 
fingernails were next. Out of a lack for a better tool, she just bit them off one by 
one.</p><p>Her shoes didn't fit her anymore. Neither did her clothes. Everything was too 
tight, too small. How much taller had she grown? It was hard to guess, but she was probably 
the same size as Leon now, and a bit taller than Tifa. It would be suicidal to walk on this 
hot ground without shoes. But she had to think first.</p><p>Taking refuge inside of one of 
the ruins, Kairi was struck by a strange feeling. Like she had been at this place 
before.</p><p>Thinking of it as superstition, Kairi looked for a room that had no windows. 
She soon found one and sat down against one of the walls. Even in there it was still hot. 
Would it get any hotter than this? This area was clearly a desert. When would night come? 
How long would it last? Kairi needed information.</p><p>Taking off her too-small shoes, 
Kairi rubbed her sore feet. Wearing those shoes would put her at serious risk if she had to 
engage in a battle. Her only chance was to find other clothes—stuff that whoever lived here 
had left behind. But first she needed to do something about her toenails. After a few 
minutes of pulling and some pain, she had reduced the length to no less than 
normal.</p><p>Barefoot, still wearing the too-tight clothes, Kairi looked through every 
room. The lower levels had vanished into the sand, but luck was with her this time and she 
found a old drawer in one of the upper rooms that contained some clothes. They were still 
not exactly her size, but they were a lot better than what she was wearing now. Aware that 
nobody would come back to take these, Kairi took whatever she could find without remorse and 
tried a few different sets with minor success.</p><p>In the end, there weren't many things 
that fit. The cloak had not vanished, thankfully. She would recover it as soon as the sun 
went down. Forced to choose between high heels and knee-high laced boots, she took the 
boots. The rest of the clothes were sort of mismatched but they were better than nothing. 
She could not stay here, but who knew if the other two girls were in the same condition and 
had better or worse luck? Clothes didn't weigh much, she would be able to take them with 
her.</p><p>Ripping a blanket from a dust-plagued bed that was half-claimed by the sand, she 
threw the rest of the clothes, including her old ones, in it and made it into a round bag, 
using thick strands of her cut-off hair as cord. Emergency had taught her to make use of 
everything in dire times.</p><p>The laced boots were actually an improvement over her old 
shoes. She hadn't taken into account how fine the sand in the desert was. It would have 
gotten into her shoes and sooner or later caused blisters. The boots were a bit tight, but 
otherwise okay. Since the drawer didn't contain any trousers, she had to go with a skirt, 
and the longest one barely reached her knees. The set was complete with a tight shirt that 
would conserve warmth when it got cold, even though Kairi was a tad embarrassed about how 
much that piece of clothing showed off her now bigger breasts.</p><p>By now the sun had made 
its way almost to the bottom of the horizon. Soon it would be night. Taking whatever wood 
she could from nearby ruins, Kairi used the small timeframe between day and night where it 
was not too hot or cold to gather as many things as she could. It would be crazy to attempt 
to travel the desert at night, so she would have to stay where she was. Even if she did find 
the others soon or if they found her, they needed a base of operations until they knew what 
was going on.</p><p>With the night came the freezing cold. Kairi chose the room without 
windows to rest in. After taking the old, hard mattress from the bed near the lower levels 
of the ruin, she burned a fire in the midst of the room, making the cold endurable. She 
could only hope that Olette and Naminé were okay.</p><p 
style="text-align:center;">---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>“Hey, where are you touching me?” 
Olette said, her face as red as a tomato.</p><p>She was shivering. It was freezing cold, and 
even though they had managed to light a fire, they were freezing. There was no cover in 
sight, and moving in this cold was a terrible idea. Olette had snuggled together with Naminé 
so closely that they could feel each other's heartbeat. What the hell had 
happened?</p><p>Olette had woken up right next to Naminé, even though she hadn't known that 
it was Naminé at that point. It took her a few minutes of confusion and pain to notice that 
her body was different, that she had grown quite a bit. She was a whole head taller than the 
grown Naminé.</p><p>Waking up the unconscious Naminé was not easy, and the blond girl broke 
out into panic when she didn't recognize Olette. It took them some time to adjust themselves 
to their situation. While Olette had Naminé cut Olette's hair pretty short, Naminé preferred 
hers to stay long, having it cut down only from her hips downwards. Now the length came in 
handy to guard against the cold.</p><p>“I wonder what happened to us.” Naminé felt terrible. 
Kairi was nowhere to be seen, she was cold, and they had no idea where they were nor what 
had happened.</p><p>“I only remember…lots of twirls, colors, and a lot of pain. We don't 
seem to be hurt, although I feel a bit sick,” Olette said, and pulled Naminé even closer. 
She had already gone through this once before, she didn't mind being this close with the 
blond girl.</p><p>“I don't understand what happened to our bodies. If this is another world, 
why would we look different? I can only think of one explanation and that is that we've aged 
somehow. But then why…” Olette ruffled her hair and immediately put the combined cloak back 
where it was. It was well below zero out and the fire and the cloak were the only things 
preventing the girls from freezing to death. Everything was okay as long as they kept their 
minds occupied, but if they fell asleep here…</p><p>“My dress is terribly tight,” Naminé 
complained.</p><p>“That's because of your chest. It's unfair that yours grew so big and mine 
didn't.” Olette sighed. Naminé was sitting directly in front of her. Part of the combined 
cloak served as a blanket to sit on, since the sand was now ice cold. This close together, 
with these bodies, Olette felt that sitting this way was different from before. Not…like 
<i>that</i>, but different.</p><p>Naminé leaned backwards, and now Olette's chest was 
pressing against her back. She didn't really mind. These bodies were clearly those of 
adults, but they really themselves weren't, not in mind.</p><p>“That's because you're always 
running around. They'd only get in the way, right?” Naminé smiled. Olette knew she was 
smiling even without seeing her. She could sometimes sense how Naminé was feeling when they 
were close.</p><p>“Right. But still…” Olette pretended to sulk for a while. Naminé didn't 
say anything.</p><p>“Do you think Kairi is okay?” It was a question she had been afraid to 
ask, especially to ask it of Naminé.</p><p>“I know she is. But…I wonder if she's also aged 
this much. Do you think Kairi will like me all grown up?” Naminé answered with a totally 
straight face and searched for Olette's hand under the cloak.</p><p>Olette did not pull her 
hand back when Naminé took hers and their fingers intertwined. She liked Naminé, and even 
though she could never love her as a girl, she loved her like a little sister. Up until now, 
Olette had never really realized how much she really meant to her.</p><p>“Tell me…how is it 
being with Kairi? I know I shouldn't ask this, but…” Olette took a deep breath. Why did she 
have to bring this up now? Was she really that curious about it?</p><p>“I don't think I can 
really explain it. It's nice. Kairi is really cautious of new things, and you know how long 
it took to just get her to open up. We do a lot of things, like I draw her, or I tell her 
about things I read. I love spending time with her. It makes me happy.”</p><p>“Is she…do you 
two have…” Olette tried to find the right words without being too embarrassed.</p><p>“I'm 
your friend, Olette. You can ask me anything.” Naminé smiled again and stood up. The cold 
instantly bit their skin, and Olette made a hissing sound from the sudden flood of cold air. 
It had gotten a little bit warmer under the cloak and now…</p><p>When she sat down again, 
Naminé changed her position. She was now facing Olette, and even though she was quite a bit 
smaller than Olette, Naminé could almost directly look in her face. The darkness of the 
night, the starless sky, and the shimmering light of the fire gave her face something noble. 
For a second, Olette blushed and forgot that it was Naminé, the naïve girl who was head over 
heels in love with Kairi, who sat there in front of her.</p><p>She came even closer. Olette 
could feel Naminé's body touching hers, both her arms sliding around her back as snuggled up 
closely to Olette. She totally disregarded the fact that her chest was pressing against the 
brunette's stomach, her head resting on her chest.</p><p>“This way it's warmer,” the woman, 
no, the <i>girl</i> said, and closed her eyes. She was still Naminé. Olette patted her head. 
Even though they were taller, older now, things had not changed between them. They would 
always be the same. They loved each other in a way no one else could understand. A pure love 
like between sisters.</p><p>“What's it like being with Yuffie? Are you happy?” Naminé asked 
out of the blue.</p><p>“Yes. I think.” Olette could not lie to Naminé. Maybe to Kairi or 
even Yuffie, but not to her. She would feel guilty of something terrible if she did. And she 
never wanted to be apart from her again.</p><p>“You <i>think?</i>” Naminé echoed, and looked 
up.</p><p>Not only she had changed. Olette was very tall now, probably a little bit taller 
than Tifa or even Leon. She was really muscular for a girl, too. Naminé could feel that 
there were dimensions of difference between Olette's trained body now and her past form. Her 
face was now more…reassuring than before. Naminé had trusted her before, but this…it was 
like her sheer presence was telling her that she was safe. Like Olette was someone Naminé 
could bet her life on, someone to protect her at all times.</p><p>“Since we got back…I was 
really worried about you two. Things have been really tense between Yuffie and me since. 
Maybe it's because I'm feeling guilty since I was off having a good time when you all were 
fighting for your lives. Maybe it's about Kairi. I thought I was over her. I don't know 
anymore.” Olette didn't know why she could tell this to Naminé so easily when it was so hard 
to admit it to herself in her own thoughts.</p><p>“Does Yuffie know? You should tell her,” 
Naminé said, and looked right into Olette's green eyes with her own blue ones.</p><p>“I 
don't want to break her heart. And I think I do like her…but…I just don't know. What use is 
it to like Kairi if she's with you? I don't want to cause you and your relationship with 
Kairi any trouble, and I don't want Yuffie to be alone, either.” It was easy to say that, 
but much harder to realize it and Olette knew it. In the end, maybe Naminé was 
right.</p><p>“Why can't you be with me <i>and</i> Kairi?” Naminé really was the one and only 
person to be able to ask such things with a straight face.</p><p>“It just doesn't work that 
way. I wish there was a 'happy end for everyone' solution, but there isn't.” Olette 
attempted to smile but gave up midways and instead patted the smaller girl's head.</p><p>“I 
believe there is. We just haven't found it yet. And…I think you should tell Yuffie how you 
feel.” Naminé behaved like a pet cat under Olette's petting. She closed her eyes and let her 
head rest on Olette's chest.</p><p>“And you're right, your breasts really didn't grow much.” 
Naminé said in a completely honest tone a second later. She got her hair ruffled for 
it.</p><p>“You can only say that because yours grew so much! I bet Kairi prefers small 
ones.” Olette stuck her tongue out and started to sulk, so obviously pretending that Naminé 
knew it was fake.</p><p>While her own dress was rather tight, Olette had other problems. Her 
trousers were too short now. They were more like hot pants in comparison to her height now. 
Her sleeves were too short now too, and the shirt she was wearing resembled a tank top with 
sleeves. Her shoes were the worst. Naminé's had already been in pieces when she came to, but 
then again, they weren't made for such a trip anyway. Olette suffered from the too-small 
size, especially because she had been carrying Naminé, who had been unable to walk barefoot 
on the hot sand of the desert.</p><p>“We need to find Kairi tomorrow. I'll try to use 
reflect magic to protect us against the sun, but it'll only help a bit. The magic wasn't 
made for that.”</p><p>Olette was thankful for any help she could get. She didn't know how 
much heavier Naminé was now, but it was much easier for her to carry her than before. Maybe 
it was because of the height difference, maybe just because she was stronger now, having the 
body of an adult.</p><p>“The sun should rise soon. Try not to fall asleep, Naminé,” Olette 
warned her companion. She thought of what else they could talk about to beat some 
time.</p><p>“Tell me more about you and Yuffie.”</p><p>“Fine. But you'll have to tell me 
about Kairi in exchange,” Olette replied, and pulled Naminé the little bit closer that was 
still between them.</p><p style="text-align:center;">---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>Kairi knew 
how to use time efficiently. There was no moon in this world, apparently, and she used the 
twilight of the morning when it wasn't too hot to explore the area. There were a lot more 
ruins to the north and the west, and a very large ruin to the east. To the south was only 
desert. Now she needed something to find the other two. She couldn't do anything too fancy; 
after all, who knew who was watching or residing here.</p><p>But luck was with her again. 
After thinking there was something odd about the horizon, Kairi shielded her eyes against 
the rising sun in the east and examined the south from a higher point. No doubt about 
it—there was smoke from a fire. Given her surroundings, the chances were good that it was 
Naminé or even both of the girls.</p><p>Which direction were they headed to? From their 
point of view, everything around them must be sand and more sand. Kairi could probably make 
it over to that southern point in less than eight hours, which was still extremely far in 
the heat of the day. She had to try anyway. If they went too far south, they might never 
find her, or she them.</p><p>Packing up the clothes and using the blanket to cover her face 
and head, and taking the cloak as additional protection, Kairi proceeded at maximum speed 
but without exhausting herself. If something attacked her, she would need to be able to 
fight.</p><p style="text-align:center;">---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>“That's east, so north is 
over there. I don't think we should go there. We should go further south, and try to get out 
of this desert,” Naminé said, remembering some lectures from Aerith about this.</p><p>Olette 
would have to force herself to keep wearing the too-small shoes. The sand was already 
becoming hotter by the minute and soon it would be too much to walk on. At least they didn't 
have any water problems. Naminé was with her, and she could conjure up magical ice as many 
times as they needed. Kairi could do the same, so at least Olette didn't need to worry about 
that.</p><p>The real problem was food. It didn't look like anything grew or lived in this 
vast desert. They could live on just water for quite a few days, but if they didn't find a 
way back or at least something to eat…</p><p>One problem after another. First they had to 
try and look for Kairi, or at least some sort of place to use as cover for the 
night.</p><p>“Wait.” Naminé stopped Olette, who was about to put on her shoes.</p><p>She 
ripped some fabric off her cloak and and pulled the laces from Olette's shoes, then 
fashioned some provisional shoes on Olette's feet and applied a Cure spell to ease the pain. 
“That'll do. I came up with the idea when I thought of what Kairi would do. Are you really 
okay carrying me? I can make some shoes for me,” Naminé said, looking at her ripped 
cloak.</p><p>“No. We don't know how often we need to change these. Or how long they'll hold. 
We can't give up our only means of staying warm at night. We'll freeze to death. Come on, 
I'll carry you.” It was the logical choice. Giving in here meant admitting that Olette 
wasn't as reliable as she thought she would be. She didn't want to do that.</p><p>Even 
though the additional weight wasn't much, it was tiring to walk in the soft sand while 
carrying someone. At least they both were uninjured. As they slowly marched south, the two 
girls wandered for over an hour in the brutal sun.</p><p>“Are you okay? You're breathing 
really heavily, Olette.” Naminé was worried. Even though Olette had the body of an adult, 
she had to carry another person in this heat. “We need to take a break. I don't know if this 
will work, but please let me down.”</p><p>Olette was about to refuse when she felt a sudden 
dizziness come over her that forced her to kneel to stop herself from throwing up. This was 
suicidal. There was nothing in sight in any direction. The smoke from their fire was long 
gone. What if someone who wasn't Kairi noticed the fire and was on their way to kill them? 
It would be impossible to fight in this heat. They had to find cover soon.</p><p>Naminé felt 
bad about being carried all this way and concentrated hard. She found it amazingly easy to 
use magic even though she wasn't in the best shape. Using a short recitation blizzard spell, 
Naminé formed a wall of ice that stretched out directly against the sun. It wasn't high, 
barely six feet, but it was three feet thick, and it provided shadow and some cold air. If 
they used Monochrome to carve a hole in the lower part, they could use the heat of the sun 
to melt some of the ice and drink the water.</p><p>“Thank you.” Olette crawled into the 
shadow but did not lean on the wall. It would be a bad idea to do so, as going back into the 
sun afterward would create too much of a temperature difference once they 
continued.</p><p>Naminé used some of the water to cool the sand under her feet. For some 
reason, this red sand refused to turn into mud when combined with water. It just…cooled 
down.</p><p>Reversing the position from last night, Naminé sat down behind Olette and 
started to apply a very weak but constant curing spell to Olette's body, trying to ease some 
of the fatigue. While Cure was primarily used for injuries of the body, Naminé found that 
the spell itself also helped with fatigue, although the effect was minimal.</p><p>“I wonder 
if we'll ever get back.” With a sigh, the brunette looked at the sky. She had noticed this 
before, but this world's sky had no clouds. The night had no stars, no moon. Where were 
they? This all seemed like a bad dream.</p><p>“We will. When we meet up with Kairi, we'll 
figure out something. The ice wall won't last long. We need to get going in maybe ten or 
twenty minutes. I tried to make it last longer, but this sun…”</p><p>“That's more than 
enough for me. I do wonder if we're going in circles, though. There is just sand all around 
in every direction, no matter how far I look. I am worried about Kairi.” Olette knew that 
they were in a dire situation, but she was thankful that Naminé was with her. If not for 
her, Olette probably would've died during the first night. Her inability to use any magic 
was becoming really hard on her.</p><p>“Thanks,” Olette whispered, and grabbed Naminé's hand 
on her shoulder. “I wouldn't know what to do without you.” She tried to imagine what it 
would be like to really love her. Olette tried but couldn't. She couldn't feel that way 
about Naminé, not even now. But trying to see her as Kairi saw her would maybe help her to 
understand how Kairi felt.</p><p>“Sometimes I'm really happy you rely on me like this.” 
Naminé leaned forward and hugged the taller girl in front of her. “Kairi is so independent, 
sometimes it's like she's pushing me away. I'm so glad you're back to talking with her. I 
missed you.” Naminé could say such things out loud without being embarrassed in the 
slightest. Olette was blushing a bit on the inside and showed a big smile.</p><p>“Let's go. 
Who knows how large this desert is.” Olette stood up and was ready to carry Naminé, but 
before she knew what happened, Naminé had put an ice cube in Olette's mouth and one in her 
own.</p><p>“Rations.” The girl smiled and let herself be lifted up.</p><p 
style="text-align:center;">---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>Kairi had found the remains of the 
fire. Three hours had passed since she had left her base, but the burned remnants of old 
wood were still there. There was no wind, no movement in the sand, so it was easy to track 
them. From the looks of the sand and early footprints, it looked as if two people had been 
there. But after a few meters, the footprints got deeper and one set of footprints 
disappeared. Was one of them injured? Had one to carry another?</p><p>Kairi couldn't imagine 
Naminé carrying Olette, but Olette carrying Naminé was quite plausible. She had to hurry, as 
they were heading deeper into the desert. How far could they have gone? If Olette was 
carrying Naminé, she had a good chance of catching them. Ignoring her need for rest, Kairi 
pushed on.</p><p>Not a half hour later, she found an area that was full of footprints, as if 
they had stopped and had wandered. There was also a part of the sand that was ice cold, like 
it had been frozen solid. That was clearly the work of magic ice. Kairi was now sure that 
these were the tracks of Olette and Naminé. Olette was unable to use magic.</p><p>They 
couldn't be much further. Taking a risk, Kairi used fire magic to send an exploding fireball 
into the sky, hoping that the others would see it. After firing three more times, she 
dematerialized Oathkeeper and continued to follow the tracks. The sun was at its height now, 
and this was not the time to wander about. But she had to find them, had to bring them 
back.</p><p style="text-align:center;">---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>“We don't know if that was 
Kairi. Something could have followed our tracks and could be trying to catch us off our 
guard! We have no idea where we are or what could be out there.” Olette was reluctant about 
going back. If the signals were a trap, and the enemy was accustomed to this heat, they had 
little chance of winning. What if a member of the Organization had followed them? But if it 
really was Kairi…</p><p>“I know it's Kairi! It just has to be.” Naminé was in favor of going 
back, Olette against it.</p><p>“Let's wait here. If it's not Kairi, we can always try to 
land a surprise hit and get away. Are you okay with using high-level magic? Not feeling too 
tired?” Olette knew that she would not last half an hour fighting in this heat. Naminé was 
her safety assurance.</p><p>“I'm okay with that. But I can sense it's Kairi. We won't have 
to fight anyone.” Naminé was so sure it was Kairi. Something like this had happened before. 
There was this link between them, something that exceeded being lovers, 
exceeded…</p><p>Olette took cover behind a sand dune and had both Keyblades summoned and 
ready. Naminé was behind another dune, using ice magic to temporarily cool down the sand to 
prevent getting burned by it. They didn't have to wait long.</p><p 
style="text-align:center;">---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>The tracks stopped not even thirty 
feet further in that direction. Kairi knew they must be around here somewhere. Taking 
another step, Kairi saw exactly what she was expecting. An ambush. Olette was rushing 
towards her, both Keyblades summoned to attack. That meant Naminé was probably at Kairi's 
back.</p><p>Summoning Oathkeeper in time, Kairi blocked the frontal assault and was 
instantly forced back by the sheer brute force. Olette really was strong now. In this range, 
Kairi stood no chance. But that meant nothing. The woman froze when she saw 
Oathkeeper.</p><p>Undoing the cloth around her head, Kairi looked at her fellow Keyblader 
and smiled. “That was one hell of an attack.”</p><p>Olette couldn't trust her eyes. It 
really was Kairi. And she had attacked her! Thankfully she wasn't hurt. “I'm sorry, but how 
was I supposed to know what you'd look like now?! These clothes, your hair!”</p><p>Kairi 
walked up to Olette and looked directly in her face. “Don't worry, I'm fine. Where's Nami—” 
They almost crashed back into the sand when Naminé jumped on Kairi's back, hugging her 
tightly.</p><p>“I knew you'd come for us! I'm so glad you're here now.” The magician was 
completely ignoring the situation.</p><p>“You sound so different. Both of you. And I see the 
same thing that happened to me happened to you,” Kairi said, and started to blush. She could 
feel Naminé's chest pressing against her back.</p><p>“You're one to talk. You look nothing 
like you did before. And your voice is different, too.” Olette's voice was complaining but 
she was also smiling. “I'm happy we're back together. But how did you find us?”</p><p>“About 
four hours away in the north there are a lot of ruins. I took cover there my first night. I 
was looking at the area from the roof of a building when I saw the smoke of your fire in the 
morning. I followed the direction, found the fire, and followed your tracks here,” Kairi 
explained. Somehow she managed to get Naminé off of her. The magician instantly started to 
jump around, trying to get back on the cooled-down sand.</p><p>Before anything else could've 
been said, Olette hugged Kairi, who was so surprised that she dropped her Keyblade, which 
dematerialized and vanished. “I'm so happy we're back together now.” With a smile on her 
face, Olette closed her eyes and enjoyed this moment of peace. She was a bit taller than 
Kairi now, but that didn't bother her.</p><p>“Me too. But we need to get moving. It's noon 
now, and we will be slower on our way back than I was on my way here,” Kairi said, patting 
Olette's back. She was really happy about finding them, but she was more worried about what 
would happen if they didn't manage to get back in time.</p><p>“Before we go, you two should 
look to see if there's anything in here that fits you. I didn't know if you two had grown 
too, so I took with me everything I could find.” She loosened up the bag that was actually 
just a piece of cloth with some clothes stashed inside and handed it over to Olette, who 
started look through it.</p><p>“Naminé, can you provide some cover again?” Olette asked 
before she started to take a closer look. “I don't think it's good to change in the heat of 
the sun. It doesn't have to last long, but it should fit all three of us in the 
shadow.”</p><p>Kairi could guess now what had caused the sand to be frozen solid. Naminé 
instantly started to chant a recitation and caused a wall of ice to erect over them, 
providing enough shadow for all three of them to stand.</p><p>Opening up the cloth and 
spreading it out on the sand, Olette started to lake a closer look at the clothes while 
Naminé sat with Kairi on her cloak.</p><p>After going through everything once, Olette picked 
a few things that looked her size and was already pulling on her shirt when she noticed that 
while Kairi had the modesty to look away and turn around, Naminé lacked that delicacy. 
Thinking of the last night, Olette thought she might as well not care, but she was still 
embarrassed. To her luck, Kairi pulled on Naminé's arm and told her to turn 
around.</p><p>About two minutes later, Olette finished up lacing up her new shoes. They fit 
well and even though she didn't like the style, they would be useful. “I'm 
done.”</p><p>Olette had completely changed out of her old clothes. Kairi turned around and 
had to suppress the urge to giggle. Out of all possible things, Olette had taken the black 
top and hot pants, along with brown half-boots. If anything, she now resembled her teacher 
both in appearance and fighting style.</p><p>“If not for your chaotic brown hair and your 
eyes, one could mistake you for Tifa from a distance. Well, except you lack in the chest 
area,” Kairi teased, but she could only smile. Olette didn't look bad, but she resembled 
Tifa so obviously that it was funny.</p><p>“These were the only things that fit!” Olette 
blushed and turned around. She had known that Kairi would make this comparison but it still 
felt weird to actually hear her say it. But what could she do? It was this or some 
unpractical clothes or too-small ones.</p><p>“You're next, Naminé. I hope there is 
something…that fits,” Kairi said, and she couldn't help but stare for a second at her chest. 
When she met Naminé's gaze, she blushed furiously and looked away. When Naminé passed by 
Olette, whose turn it was to sit down now, she whispered something that made Olette sulk 
when she sat down and Kairi asked her what was wrong.</p><p>“Nothing!” Olette was a bit 
angry and looked into the distance. It wasn't her fault she wasn't a booby monster like 
Naminé now or Tifa!</p><p>Naminé had it a bit harder to look through things. Either they 
were too big or they simply didn't fit her. The only pair of shoes left that remotely fit 
were another pair of boots, although these were even higher than Kairi's but not laced. The 
best thing she could find was a long white robe with blue stripes over the back and the 
parts near the hips. There was even something written on it: <i>Verum ultra 
Verum</i>.</p><p>“I'm done. What do we do with our old clothes and the leftovers?” Naminé 
found it difficult to walk with these new shoes, but she managed not to fall.</p><p>“Taking 
them with us. We don't know how long we're going to be stuck here. And we have to find out 
where 'here' is. But first we'll go back to the ruins.” Standing up, Kairi looked Naminé up 
and down. The look was entirely different from before. The appearance of a naïve teenager 
had vanished. Now she was looking at a grown woman who looked like a magician from head to 
toe.</p><p>“It suits you. It makes you really look like a sorceress.” Kairi complimented 
her, then proceeded to get the cloth back into the shape of a bag. The ice wall was about to 
vanish.</p><p>“You get compliments and I get mocked. The world is so unfair. In many ways.” 
Olette was still sulking. But when she looked at Naminé, the clothes really did suit 
her.</p><p>“I think those clothes look really good on you. Kairi was just teasing you, 
Olette.” Naminé knew that Olette was seriously sulking and gave Kairi, who just happened to 
look her way, a serious glare.</p><p>They didn't speak much after packing up. Their cloaks 
served well to protect from the immense heat, and the new clothes were a big help. Naminé 
figured out pretty soon how to walk with the boots, and Olette had no problems at all. To 
save time, they only rested once, but by the time the sun had almost vanished under the 
horizon, the ruins were still a good distance away.</p><p>“We have no choice. We need to 
keep going. There is absolutely nothing here we could use for a fire to pass the night. What 
did you two use as fuel for your last fire?” Looking around, the redhead really couldn't see 
anything that could serve to keep a fire going. It was impossible to maintain a fire without 
any material, not even a magical one.</p><p>“There was some wood around the area where we 
woke up. I don't know where it was from,” Olette replied, taking a deep breath. It would 
take less than a hour for the cold to come.</p><p>“Doesn't matter anymore. Let's go.” Kairi 
put the cloth back on her face, and Olette and Naminé used parts of their cloak to imitate 
her. They tried to maintain a little bit of warmth by keeping close to each other, but it 
didn't help. A half an hour later, they were freezing. And without the sun, they had no 
orientation, but Kairi trusted her instincts and kept going.</p><p>Not long after that, the 
ruins were finally in sight. The three girls looked at them for a few seconds from the top 
of a high dune. They were almost there. Kairi thought she saw something in the distance out 
of the corner of her eye, but it was too late when she reacted.</p><p>Suddenly, Naminé fell 
over and hit the ground. Kairi instantly knelt down over the girl's still form and felt her 
pulse. She was alive, but ice cold. As Naminé had no physical training, it was no wonder the 
cold took more of a toll on her than on the others.</p><p>Olette knelt down and picked 
Naminé up before she got any colder, then wrapped her cloak around her as she carried the 
girl in her arms. It was a hindrance, but this way, she would be warmer.</p><p>“We need to 
get to those ruins fast. She's as cold as the sand.” Olette was so worried that her voice 
was shaking a bit.</p><p>Kairi only nodded, not wasting any more breath. They started moving 
much faster than before, running part of the way when the ground allowed for it. They were 
soon out of breath, but at least the cold wasn't as brutal anymore now that they were 
exhausting themselves. She was a bit surprised. She knew that Olette and Naminé had become 
close during the incident with the Organization when Kairi had almost died, but she hadn't 
known that the brunette cared about Naminé this much. She couldn't put a finger on exactly 
why she was thinking about this. It was sort of sweet, but then…</p><p>It still took them 
over an hour to finally reach the ruin Kairi had used the night before. While Kairi was 
laying Naminé down on the mattress of the old bed, Olette was a few levels below them, 
trying to break up the wooden frame of the bed for a fire. After a few useless tries, Olette 
summoned Hero's Crest and started to hack and slash at the frame until at least the part 
that wasn't submerged in sand was cut loose.</p><p>Olette almost dropped the wood when she 
came up to the room. Kairi was sharing the blanket with Naminé, trying to warm her 
up.</p><p>“Put it on top of the remains from yesterday,” Kairi said, motioning towards the 
wood. “If it goes out, we can use the drawer in one of the upper levels.” She then got up, 
and Olette noticed that she was really relieved that Kairi was fully dressed, and used a 
fire spell to light a fire.</p><p>“Hold her for a second. I'm gonna move the mattress closer 
to the fire.” Olette gave a nod and picked up Naminé, holding her until Kairi pushed the 
mattress so close to the fire that any closer would set it aflame.</p><p>After Olette put 
Naminé down again, Kairi quickly left the room and came back, seconds later, with a big but 
thin wooden plank. “This will serve as door,” she said. “It'll leave enough air for us to 
breathe and it'll keep the warmth in.” Kairi placed the plank over the small doorframe that 
connected the room to the rest of the ruin, then vanished under the blanket.</p><p>Olette 
felt a bit left out. Should she just sit on the mattress and ignore what Kairi was doing? 
Sure, Naminé needed the warmth, but what about her? It was still cold, and there was no 
second blanket there, and nothing she could use to cover herself except her cloak. Pulling 
the cloak tighter around herself, Olette closed her eyes and tried to ignore everything 
around her.</p><p>Not even a minute passed before Kairi put her hand on her shoulder. What 
did she want now? To show off how close she and Naminé were?</p><p>“What are you doing? Do 
you think I can warm her all by myself? What are you waiting for? An invitation from me?” 
Kairi seemed deadly serious.</p><p>Olette blushed a bit at the thought of being this close 
to Kairi, even though the situation was a difficult one.</p><p>“We made up, didn't we?” 
Kairi said, looking at the ground. Her face was slightly red, from the light of the fire or 
from…something else, Olette didn't know.</p><p>But she didn't have to think about it any 
longer. Naminé was there between them. No matter how things had been in the past, she 
trusted Kairi and she felt that it was the right thing to do. Taking off her own cloak and 
collecting Kairi's and Naminé's as well, she joined the other two under the blanket, using 
the discarded cloaks as second blanket over them. It wasn't much, but it was an 
effort.</p><p>Being so close to Naminé was nothing new, even though Olette was still a 
little bit embarrassed about being so close to her in front of Kairi. It was so…weird. Kairi 
was so close that Olette could hear her breathing. She didn't do anything Olette would've 
thought of as offensive. No mocking. Doing nothing to Naminé. There were…ways to keep Naminé 
warm without her, but Kairi preferred to have her, Olette, next to her.</p><p>“You're 
horrible,” Olette said, and looked away. She could look right into Kairi's eyes, but she 
didn't for fear of the feelings that might come up. She was afraid of knowing if she really 
still loved Kairi.</p><p>“What did I do to deserve that?” Kairi asked. She reached out past 
Naminé and grabbed Olette's arm to pull her closer. Naminé was facing Olette, and while 
Kairi had one arm around her waist, the other was still holding Olette's right 
wrist.</p><p>“Nothing. That's the problem! You're with Naminé, you're a couple, and you're 
not doing anything! Why are you being considerate of me?” Olette didn't try to free herself. 
Instead, she draped her left arm around Naminé and looked directly at Kairi. The light was 
in her back, so Kairi wouldn't be able to see her bright red face.</p><p>“Because you're 
also important to me,” Kairi answered truthfully. She knew it was stupid to lie in this kind 
of situation and she was sick of this too. Olette deserved an honest answer and she had 
gotten one.</p><p>“You're just saying that. If I am also important to you, why did you 
reject me?!” Olette was angry now and tried to free her right wrist from Kairi's 
hand.</p><p>“I rejected her too, did you forget that? She taught me that it's wrong to run 
from your feelings. Even if they change over time. I don't want to see any of you hurt 
again.” Kairi's voice was shaking.</p><p>Olette had never seen Kairi like this. Naminé 
really had changed her. To the better. Or the worse. “But then…what should I do…?” Olette 
was whispering to herself, but Kairi still heard it.</p><p>“Do what your heart tells you.” 
Kairi knew that it was a really cliché response, but it had worked for her. After all this 
time of ignoring all her feelings, she had finally faced them and found love.</p><p>“You 
won't like that,” Olette said, taking a deep breath. But maybe it was the only way. She 
couldn't think clearly, couldn't think of anything else. Maybe it was time to stop lying to 
herself, to stop pretending that problems went away if they were ignored long enough. That 
some feelings were problems.</p><p>Before Kairi could respond, Olette leaned forward, and in 
a freezing night in a world they did not know, in the light of a fire to save their lives, 
they shared a single, pure kiss.</p>
