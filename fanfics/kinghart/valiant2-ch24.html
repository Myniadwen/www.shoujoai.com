<h1>Valiant Hearts II (part 24 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kinghart/index.html">Kingdom Hearts</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yuritale.html">Yuritale</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kinghart/valiant2-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Black Sand 
– Evils Reckoning</i></p><p>"Eternal life does sound promising…but first, I shall see to 
Aladdin's destruction." The ruler of the Land of the Black Sand had the black lamp in his 
tight grip. His blue outfit was an eerie image among the shadows of the throne 
room.</p><p>The massive red genie floated, motionless, next to the wizard. He was not happy 
that the human had released him. The human was so…<i>cautious</i> with his wishes. He 
refused riches, refused power. Only the promise of eternal youth and life had sparked some 
interest in him.</p><p>The red genie was now bound to the black lamp. What an error he had 
made, ordering that filthy mongrel of a blue genie to make him a genie himself. He should 
have known that power came with a compromise of sorts.</p><p>Mozenrath, the name of the 
wizard who had found the red genie's lamp, was also the ruler of the Land of the Black 
Sand. With a single movement of his powerful magic glove, the wizard vanished into thin 
air.</p><p>It was a simple teleportation spell. He reappeared deep underground, in a cell 
without light. A single chamber hundreds of meters under the earth, where Mozenrath kept 
<i>him</i> prisoner.</p><p>"Aladdin, how does it feel to finally taste defeat?" The wizard 
stood right in front of the young lad who was chained to the wall. Next to him was a cage 
that contained the big tiger that belonged to Princess Jasmine, as well as the annoying 
bird and monkey that Aladdin kept with him.</p><p>Mozenrath kept the boy's genie sealed in 
a separate chamber. His own genie had been…of valuable help in doing so.</p><p>"You aren't 
going to get away with this, Mozenrath!" the lad yelled, and he tried to break free of his 
chains. It was a rather futile attempt with his agile but not especially muscular 
frame.</p><p>"Excellent. Defiance in the eyes of inevitable defeat and loss. Just what I 
would expect from you, Aladdin." The red genie then laughed and took form, showing himself 
to Aladdin for the first time.</p><p>"Jafar!" Gasping with surprise, the boy's eyes widened 
in terror. If there was anyone worse than Mozenrath, then it was Jafar, the wizard who had 
taken over Agrabah not so long ago and who had only been beaten because of his greed for 
power.</p><p>"Indeed." The genie had now taken the form of a middle-aged man with red and 
black clothes and a long snake staff. "Welcome to your own personal hell, 
Aladdin."</p><p>"You can't kill me, Jafar! It's against the genie rules!" Aladdin 
smiled—only to be hit by a beam of black energy. Mozenrath was grinning in a devilish 
manner. "But I guess <i>he</i> can…"</p><p>"How about you leave him to me? He will 
be…surprised by what he can live through." Jafar was grinning smugly and he leaned forward, 
looking right into Aladdin's eyes. He would not be robbed of his revenge on the 
boy.</p><p>"I was planning to torture him myself, but I guess since you cannot kill him, I 
can let you have that little…pleasure." With monstrous laughter, the wizard again vanished 
into thin air, leaving the animals and the boy alone with the genie.</p><p>Despite the 
extreme barrier between the surface and the underground chamber, Mozenrath was sure he 
could hear Aladdin's screams of agony, which he found most pleasurable. With a wave of his 
hand, he summoned his mumlocks, his undead warriors and guards. "Find Princess Jasmine and 
that flying rug! Bring them to me…alive." He nearly hissed the last words and broke out 
into laughter. Everything was going as planned.</p><p>But there still was a problem. Jafar 
refused to tell him how exactly he had lost his last battle against Aladdin. There must be 
something the genie was hiding from him. He would learn…in time.</p><p 
style="text-align:center;">- Valiant Hearts -</p><p>Olette felt terrible. She still hadn't 
resolved her issues with Yuffie, and now Leon had called them for a new mission. But for 
the first time, she pushed aside personal feelings for just a little bit and concentrated 
on the mission in front of her.</p><p>"Kairi liberated that world in our crusade against 
Ansem's forces. But now something seems to have happened. Cid's tech is getting 
measurements of Heartless that we've never seen before. Kairi, I think you can explain 
better what exactly happened back then." Leon leaned on his favorite spot on the wall, 
while the girls were sitting in various spots, wearing their battle clothing.</p><p>"When I 
first went to Agrabah, the place was ruled by a wizard called Jafar. He was powerful, but 
with the help of a local boy named Aladdin and his genie, I was able to beat him. He ended 
up wishing himself into a genie to claim the world's heart for himself, but that was his 
demise. A genie is bound to a magic lamp, which can be used to control him. We made use of 
that and sealed him away. Then we hid the lamp." Kairi finished her report and looked at 
Leon.</p><p>"From what we know, we can assume that Jafar, now with the power of a genie, is 
responsible for the attack of the Heartless that occurred a while ago. We don't know if it 
was a warning or a trap to lure you there. Either way, we have little choice but to send 
you there. The gateway you used last time is still unstable. Cid invented a machine to open 
the portal safely, but you still need to be cautious when using it. Nothing like that 
malfunction has ever happened before, but does look like Jafar is responsible for that as 
well." Leon took a small break.</p><p>"We can safely assume that someone found the lamp and 
freed Jafar. Your mission is to go to Agrabah, restore order, and remove or kill Jafar if 
possible.</p><p>"From what we know, the laws of magic in that world are different. Magical 
beasts such as genies would not be affected by simple magic or weapons. The Keyblade is 
special, but it's untested. Thankfully, there is no sign of the Organization being involved 
in this." Leon looked from one girl to another. "Mission start is at 2200 hours. Get 
ready." He stood up straight and nodded. "Good luck."</p><p>Kairi had already explained the 
necessary things to the other girls. Beside their clothes, weapons, and rations, they 
needed special clothes to blend in and to be protected from the desert climate.</p><p>All 
three of them wore long capes that protected them from the sandy winds in every direction 
along with a head cloth. It was shortly after nine—in less than one hour they had to leave. 
Olette wanted to go and look for Yuffie, but they still had things to do.</p><p>Tifa and 
Aerith were waiting for them back at their house, and when they arrived, Aerith took Olette 
aside to recharge the lingering magic in her clothes. On a mission, Naminé could do it as 
well, but it was better for her at this point to conserve her power. Tifa gave Kairi and 
Naminé a few tips regarding the desert and dealing with wizards.</p><p>Olette gasped and 
twitched when Aerith shot raw magical energy into her clothes. It really helped her to 
avoid injuries, but the fact that Aerith had to recharge them because Olette lacked magical 
power herself was rather annoying. It hurt quite a bit, too.</p><p>"Have you seen Yuffie, 
Aerith?" Olette asked while the woman circled around her, testing the magical flow here and 
there, giving a small nod each time she found it to be satisfying.</p><p>"No. I'm sorry, 
Olette. Did something happen? Yuffie seemed a bit…angry the last time I saw her." Aerith 
gave Olette a pat on the head. "I almost forgot. Rydia brought this over earlier." Pulling 
a black headband from her pocket, she gave it to Olette. "It's the same thing Yuffie has, 
but this one is enchanted."</p><p>Olette grabbed the band. Hesitating slightly, she put it 
on. It fit to the inch. It also held some of her hair back, which could be useful in a 
fight. She had thought about getting a shorter cut before because of that.</p><p>"Thanks. 
Tell Rydia I'm grateful." Olette looked at the clock. Less than thirty minutes. They had to 
go.</p><p>Naminé and Olette went ahead and left, saying their goodbyes to Tifa and Aerith. 
Kairi stayed behind for a minute.</p><p>"I'll bring them back alive. Don't worry about us." 
After seeing the smiles on the faces of the two women, Kairi left and joined up with the 
other two girls.</p><p>Cid was already in place. He had finished adjustments on his gateway 
stabilizer. The portal was still dangerous, but he had found a way to stabilize it, which 
would give them the chance to go through it. Since there was no way to contact Hollow 
Bastion while at another world, he had to keep the portal open and seal the zone in case 
the girls came back.</p><p>"Y'all ready to go and kick ass?" Cid laughed and took a deep 
drag of his cigarette.</p><p>Kairi looked at her clock. It was ten minutes before ten. It 
would still take some time to open the gateway. They were right on time. 
"Yes."</p><p>Simultaneously, multiple Keyblades appeared. Two for Olette, and one for Kairi 
and Naminé each. They didn't know what was inside the portal, so just in case, they were 
going in full battle formation.</p><p>"Then let's start this thing up!" Cid hammered a few 
buttons and the machine started to emit a dark blue glow that grabbed the invisible portal. 
The previously dim outlines of the portal suddenly stabilized.</p><p>Naminé was the first 
to lift her Keyblade, and to the surprise of everyone, she shouted, "Wisdom!"</p><p>After 
getting confused looks from the others present, Naminé started smiling. "I read this in a 
book. The heroes go on an epic quest to vanquish evil. Each of them embodies something. I 
am Wisdom. Olette would be Power, and Kairi Courage. It was called <i>The Legend of 
Hyrule</i>."</p><p>Everyone started laughing. It was just like Naminé to come up with 
something so silly. Life was not as simple or easy as fiction, but why not? It certainly 
didn't hurt to be a little bit silly to relieve some stress just before a 
mission.</p><p>Naminé once again lifted her Keyblade, directed it at the portal, and with a 
deadly serious expression, she shouted, "Wisdom!"</p><p>Olette followed, lifting both her 
Keyblades and directing them at the gap in air. Taking a deep breath, she did it just like 
Naminé. Her voice triumphed far over Naminé's. "Power!"</p><p>Kairi felt a bit silly, but 
finished the scene by slowly lifting Oathkeeper to the gate. "Courage!"</p><p>The blades 
started to emit tiny light beams. They closed in on each other and finally merged in the 
place where the gateway was. A portal, one of darkness and mystery, opened in front of 
them. It was finally time—time to say goodbye to Hollow Bastion for some time and (how 
Naminé said it was so fitting) vanquish evil.</p><p>"Good riddance!" Cid yelled when 
everyone had jumped into the portal.</p><p>Not he nor the girls were aware that they had an 
observer, who stared at the portal with cold eyes.</p><p>The gateway was the same as 
ever…with one exception. There was a tremendous amount of Heartless right in front of the 
gateway that stretched far as they could see. There were much too many to get rid of one by 
one, but this was a bridge between worlds, the only place Naminé could go as wild as she 
wanted.</p><p>Kairi and Olette secured the front, cutting apart the Darkball Heartless that 
dared to approach them. Naminé was already gathering magic energy. Despite the fact that 
they didn't know what waited for them in Agrabah, it was better for Kairi and Olette to 
conserve their powers. If they didn't, Naminé alone would be up against the magic of a 
genie, and that was a losing battle, even for Aerith or Rydia.</p><p>Naminé was always 
growing, getting more powerful. And those Heartless would now feel her newly gained 
power."<i>Heir to the flames so eternal, burning the core of the soul, deliverer of fiery 
judgment, horned beast man of hell. Bring oblivion to those standing before me! 
Ifrit!</i>"</p><p>The ground split in front of Kairi and Olette, and two clawed paws arose 
out of it, pulling a heavy body behind them—a fire-breathing beast that was at least two 
meters in height. Naminé had successfully summoned the beast Ifrit, one of the royal 
eidolons of fire.</p><p>"<i>Obliterate!</i>" Naminé shouted, and the beast 
howled.</p><p>With just a few swings of his monstrous paws, wrapped in all-burning fire, 
Ifrit cleared the path before them. Naminé knew she couldn't keep this up for the entire 
way, so a few swings later, she changed orders. "<i>Release your power!</i>"</p><p>Naminé 
felt a stab of pain in her head and she staggered back a few steps. She had never done this 
before, and Ifrit's strength was beyond her expectations. Ifrit howled again and floated 
just a few feet above the ground. Fire surrounded him like comets of destructive power. 
With an ear-piercing howl, the eidolon flew through the Heartless, burning everything in 
his way to a crisp.</p><p>The path was clear. Olette offered support for Naminé, but the 
girl had already recovered. She knew she couldn't be a shackle on their legs 
forever.</p><p>Giving it their all, the girls ran. Cid and everyone could deal with a few 
measly Heartless.</p><p>Kairi didn't remember the way to Agrabah being so long. After a few 
minutes of running, Naminé was out of breath, but still keeping up. Aerith had taught her 
how to use a combination spell that was called Haste. It really helped her and Kairi to 
keep up with Olette, whose speed was unbelievable.</p><p>"Stop! It's right here!" Kairi 
stopped just as the Haste spell wore off. It had been a short-lived experience, but the 
spell was still useful. Kairi could never learn combination magic, and she once again was 
grateful Naminé was with her.</p><p>Kairi had no time for silliness now, so she opened the 
portal on her own, finding the exact point on instinct. The gateway opened, and all three 
of them jumped through. The pathway was once again filled with Heartless—something powerful 
must have caused them to appear.</p><p>And Kairi saw that it was something powerful indeed. 
Agrabah had changed.</p><p>The ground was the first thing they noticed. The sand was black, 
a dark shining sand that Kairi had never seen before. The city was virtually deserted, the 
streets empty, the market quiet. The palace was no longer where it used to be. It floated 
easily a hundred feet in the air over its initial position.</p><p>Kairi felt the danger 
immediately. Pulling Naminé and Olette by their arms, Kairi hid them in an empty house. 
What followed was rather disgusting. Eight zombies—that was the only possible explanation 
Kairi could come up when she looked at them—walked past the house, seemingly on 
patrol.</p><p>"Those aren't Heartless," Olette said, and immediately put a hand over her 
mouth. The zombies didn't seem to notice her. At least they weren't very bright.</p><p>The 
three of them went further into the house, hiding on the ground. "What's going on here, 
Kairi? I've never seen this world before, but I can tell it isn't supposed to look like 
this." Olette was confused. Zombies walking around was certainly <i>not</i> 
normal.</p><p>"You're right. This used to be a lively desert town. That flying palace over 
there must be Jafar's work. I don't know where the zombies came from. Genies are restricted 
from killing and resurrecting people." Kairi was well informed on these things from the 
last time she'd been there.</p><p>"Let's lie low and get to the palace. It's dark, but we 
should be careful." Kairi looked at the other two, who acknowledged her words as an order. 
Leaving their Keyblades—they would attract the Heartless—they began their infiltration. As 
they moved closer, they found out what had happened to the people of Agrabah.</p><p>On the 
roof stood two human statues. It was clear that they had been human at some point. Their 
expressions, their clothes…everything pointed towards that fact. They had been petrified 
alive, turned from flesh to stone.</p><p>Kairi was not sure if it was Jafar's work, but it 
sure looked like it. But why rule over a kingdom with nobody to rule…unless this was just a 
temporary measure. What was Jafar planning…?</p><p>Olette found it much easier than the 
other two to jump from roof to roof, while Naminé needed her and Kairi's help. After a 
while, Olette simply grabbed the sorceress by her waist and jumped while holding 
her.</p><p>It was too easy…<i>much</i> too easy to get near the palace. Something was 
up.</p><p>Part of the palace's dungeon was still visible in the ground. Whatever had lifted 
the building had done so with brute force. Zombies were patrolling the streets in massive 
numbers. It was sheer luck that they had gone undetected until now.</p><p>"How are we going 
to get up there?" Naminé said.</p><p>"It's risky, but let's look for the boy who helped me 
last time. He had a genie and a flying carpet. We could use those. Naminé, you wait here. 
Olette, you'll know him when you see him. He has short puffy black hair and he's usually 
accompanied by a small monkey and the flying carpet. You're the fastest of us, but try to 
be cautious. Jafar hesitated to get rid of me when he had the chance, but he probably won't 
commit the same error again," Kairi ordered, and looked around. This place was as good as 
any. It was high, and the walls provided some cover from the wind and curious 
eyes.</p><p>"I'll be back in thirty minutes." Olette jumped off the building, rammed her 
Keyblade into the wall, and used it as a stepping stone to reach the building across the 
street.</p><p>Kairi sighed. "<i>That</i> wasn't subtle or cautious…"</p><p>She looked at 
Naminé; she still had things for her to do. "I want you to rest. I don't know when Jafar 
will notice us, and you've already summoned something." Kairi knew a lot about the strain 
of using magic. She had talked about it with Rydia and Aerith multiple times.</p><p>Naminé 
didn't object. She lay against the wall and closed her eyes, trying to relax her mind. It 
didn't take much to cancel the effect of a single summoning. She didn't have to sleep. Just 
closing her eyes and losing some fatigue was enough.</p><p>Kairi, in the meanwhile, 
monitored the streets. The patrols occurred in regular intervals. It was difficult to 
determine the zombies' strength without fighting them, but if they had to, then it was more 
advantageous to do so as far away from the palace as possible.</p><p>Half an hour passed. 
Naminé finished recovering, but remained on stand-by. She only stood up and moved around 
every ten minutes to prevent her body from falling asleep. In this way she continued to 
preserve her mental power in case of an emergency. Kairi was proud that Naminé had listened 
well to her explanations and rules.</p><p>There was no sign of Olette. Kairi began to 
anticipate the worst. But there had been no alarm. Kairi decided she would give her another 
five minutes until she alarmed Naminé and moved positions.</p><p>But before that, something 
unexpected happened. Kairi instantly recognized someone who was not part of her 
team.</p><p>It was the woman Aladdin had saved from Jafar last time. She was wrapped in 
black clothes and had her hair in a tight ponytail. Armed only with a whip, she was heading 
to the palace on a flying carpet. Kairi knew that what she was doing was suicide. Jafar 
would just shoot her down or capture her and the carpet both. By the time they flew past 
the place where Kairi was hiding, more than half the city was alarmed.</p><p>"Naminé! Shoot 
her down!" Kairi ordered and the blond witch instantly jumped up and took a few seconds to 
find her target. "Get her to land! Don't injure them if possible!"</p><p>They were allies, 
not enemies, but they were a liability, approaching like that. That woman might be brave, 
but evidently she was not very smart.</p><p>There was no time for incantations. Using 
Monochrome as an amplifier, Naminé fired multiple salves of ice magic at the carpet, 
forcing it to lower its altitude. Kairi could only hope that Olette was watching 
them.</p><p>Luck was on her side. From a nearby building, a shadow raced over the ground. 
After an enormous jump, the shadow crashed into the carpet, forcing it to land. The whole 
spectacle didn't take more than fifteen seconds.</p><p>"We're moving!" Kairi didn't wait 
for a reply. Naminé would follow her unconditionally anywhere. Leaving the roof, they 
headed down the street, where Olette was fighting off the zombie soldiers as she protected 
the woman and the carpet.</p><p>"Olette! Come on!" Kairi shouted, and summoned Oathkeeper 
to take care of two approaching zombie guards. She attacked them and they burst into 
smaller parts upon the impact of the weapon.</p><p>Olette caught up with them, keeping the 
rescued woman next to her. The carpet floated right above them.</p><p>"Naminé, let's get 
out of here!" Kairi said, and started to fire carefully at the approaching guards. They 
were useless—glass cannons. The Heartless that joined the fight because of the Keyblades 
posed much more of a threat. But they were attacking the guards too.</p><p>"<i>Dark 
Mist!</i>" Naminé shouted. Her spell wrapped the entire street in a thick fog. Kairi 
grabbed the hands of her fellow Keybladers and started running. She knew this part well 
enough from her observations to sense where the guards' blind spots were.</p><p 
style="text-align:center;">- Valiant Hearts -</p><p>Yuffie ran for her life. The zombies 
were no problem, but the guy who ordered them around surely was. She had been not cautious 
enough—trying too hard to look for Olette.</p><p>Dodging another beam of black energy, 
Yuffie jumped over the edge of a building, made a rapid descent, and threw a smoke grenade 
just below her before vanishing into the building behind her and going back up the 
stairs.</p><p>She was too smart for the wizard. She could hear him cursing and shouting for 
the zombies—he called them mumlocks—to look for the "pesky little girl." Who did that guy 
think he was?</p><p>But Yuffie had problems of her own. The room she was in suddenly 
blocked out all sound and light. It was dark before, but now she was in pitch-black 
darkness.</p><p>"You…are with the Keybladers." Someone's voice echoed in her head. Yuffie 
was unable to move. It was like she was wrapped in thick chains, or paralyzed. What 
trickery was this? The wizard had obviously lost her, so who…?</p><p>A face appeared before 
her, out of nothingness. It was a red face, with a smooth beard and a mustache, pointy 
ears, and empty yellow eyes. "You looked like you were in trouble. You're safe here. Excuse 
the little…<i>inconvenience</i> my magic caused you."</p><p>Yuffie was doubtful. What was 
this thing? How did it know she was related to Olette and the others? There…was something 
odd about him. But she couldn't tell right away what. At least she could move now, even 
though the room was still pitch black. Something told Yuffie that this was no longer a room 
at all.</p><p>"Who are you? Why did you help me? And how did you know about the Keyblade?" 
Yuffie remembered parts about the reports from Kairi's first trip to this place. Something 
about an evil wizard being the source of the Heartless.</p><p>"I am a genie. Obviously I 
know about the Keybladers, those who banish the dark ones. And I helped you because I need 
your help." Jafar pulled a sad face as if he were telling a sob story. "The wizard you just 
escaped—he is my master. He wants to throw this world into darkness with my 
help."</p><p>"Why should I believe you? What if you're just one of the wizard's elaborate 
ploys?" Yuffie looked around for a way out, but no matter how far she went, it seemed like 
this space was just a few feet wide. She couldn't get away from the face.</p><p>"You do not 
have to believe me, but hear me out at least. I want your help. Free me from my master! I 
can grant anyone three wishes, and the wizard is already thinking of using them to throw 
this world into chaos!" Jafar had met enough heroes to know that the phrase "you do not 
have to believe me" was a surefire way of making them believe <i>anything</i>.</p><p>Yuffie 
took a deep breath. She remembered something about a genie. Hadn't the boy who helped Kairi 
beat the wizard had a genie? Could it be this one?</p><p>"Why do I need to free you? If you 
saved me from the wizard, can't you just escape from him as well?" Yuffie didn't know the 
slightest thing about how the whole genie business worked.</p><p>"I cannot. There are some 
things a genie is not allowed to do. I cannot kill, I cannot make someone love another, I 
cannot revive the dead, I cannot turn my magic against my master, I—"</p><p>"That's a lot 
of things you can't do. And how would I go about freeing you from the wizard? Would that 
mean I can be granted any three wishes too?" Yuffie imagined a really, <i>really</i> big 
stash of materia.</p><p>"My lamp. We genies are bound to a lamp. The owner of the lamp, the 
one who holds it, owns the genie. The wizard has hidden the lamp in the palace. But I 
cannot show it to you or give it to you. Genie rules." Jafar was slowly making progress. 
"But there is one way for me to escape the rules."</p><p>Yuffie was a little curious. 
Escape the rules? "Does that mean you could kill, use your magic against your master, make 
someone love…another…" Yuffie's mind stopped working for just a second. If she were to own 
the lamp…</p><p>"Yes. Only slave genies are bound to the lamp. If you were so noble as to 
wish a poor genie free, I'd be able to fulfill any of your wishes. Not just three, but 
<i>any</i>. But nobody bothers to wish a genie free. I have been in service for over ten 
thousand years, and not once has my master considered wishing me free."</p><p>Yuffie was 
fighting in her mind. Was it right to believe him? But if he was speaking the 
truth…wouldn't that mean he could make it so that Olette forgot about her feelings for 
Kairi? So that she returned to Yuffie, and they could be happily together?</p><p>"Who says 
you won't just turn on me? Who hasn't heard it before! A powerful magic entity sealed in 
something, asking for a brave hero to release it. And the second the hero does, the entity 
kills the hero. Who says things aren't going to go that way?" Yuffie was still suspicious 
of the genie.</p><p>"Before you release me, you could wish for me to never harm you. You 
have three wishes. You can use up two before you wish me free! But only as free genie am I 
also free from rules. Is there one particular wish you would want fulfilled?" Jafar was 
smiling nicely. "Do you want me to revive someone from the dead? To kill an enemy of yours? 
To give you the love of someone you hold dear?"</p><p>Yuffie's eyes widened, and Jafar's 
grin turned smug. "I see you have someone on your mind. Someone you hold really dear, 
perhaps? Or maybe someone that has been stolen away from you? A nobleman you could never 
dream to reach? An old love you want to regain?" The girl didn't have to know that these 
things were actually outside his power. The rules didn't change for free 
genies.</p><p>Yuffie was shaking. Olette could be hers. Her feelings for Kairi would vanish 
completely. They could go back to how things were before. Joking around, living together, 
being happy. It was all…it was all Kairi's fault that her happiness was slowly being taken 
from her. It was not fair. Not fair at all!</p><p>"You could really do that?" Yuffie was 
wavering. The temptation was eating away at her. The jealousy in her head made her blind to 
the danger.</p><p>Jafar seemed to inhale a lot of air and grew in size. The rest of his 
genie body appeared, muscular and powerful, and he posed before Yuffie. "Phenomenal cosmic 
powers! But only as a free genie can I fulfill your wish for love or kill the wizard. But 
to free me, you first have to get my lamp back from him."</p><p>Jafar was so very close, he 
could literally taste victory already. "The wizard has hidden the lamp well inside the 
palace. Even I do not know where it is. I could only find it if he rubbed it. But he keeps 
me as I am, unable to return into my small but only home." It didn't hurt to tell a bit 
more of a sob story. The Keybladers and their friends were suckers for justice.</p><p>"Can 
you bring me to the palace? I don't have the tools with me to go there myself. I…I will 
free you, genie. But I will not completely trust you yet. I shall make a wish for you to 
never hurt me." Yuffie was not taking any chances. If she truly could get Olette back with 
this…</p><p>"I cannot, I am sorry. But I can give you the ability to go there. I shall 
return us to Agrabah." He snapped his fingers and Yuffie found herself on the roof of a 
house. Most of the city's houses looked the same, but she was sure it was the one she had 
passed on her run from the wizard.</p><p>Jafar snapped his fingers again and Yuffie felt 
kind of sick. She staggered backwards. Falling on her bottom, she noticed that she had 
grown black, spiky wings—the kind one would expect on a demon or succubus.</p><p>"With 
these, you should reach the palace easily. The lamp is small, black and…" Jafar thought for 
a second, snapped and created a black lamp that looked just like his. It was an ordinary 
oil lamp.</p><p>"It looks like this one. Please, find my lamp and release me from the 
influence of the wizard!" Jafar made his last plea and pretended to vanish. "He is calling 
me. I trust in you, girl!" With a single small puff of wind, he disappeared.</p><p>Yuffie 
had a few problems using these new wings of hers. It was difficult to just take off. Why 
couldn't that genie think of something better? But since they were part of her body, she 
could easily avoid the problem of losing her method of transport.</p><p>Way ahead of her, 
near the palace, there was quite a spectacle going on. Yuffie could tell, even as far away 
as she was. Someone was firing fire magic at something in the air. But it was too far to 
make out who was shooting and at what. But it could only be Naminé or Kairi. Olette must be 
with…her.</p><p>Yuffie gritted her teeth. She could only take so much. Olette was probably 
enjoying her time with Kairi already. Kairi. It was all her fault…if only she didn't 
exist!</p><p>Using the commotion to practice flying, Yuffie quickly got the gist of it. It 
was not really difficult, just tiring. She didn't even bother looking for Olette anymore. 
Kairi would just send her back, and Olette would happily obey. No…she had to get that lamp. 
And to get Olette back from that thief.</p><p>The palace seemed virtually unguarded. Yuffie 
approached from below, in the shadow of the floating thing. Not even mumlocks were there. 
But she couldn't let her guard down. If that genie thing really could grant any three 
wishes…then the lamp must be well protected.</p><p>Making her way up, Yuffie finally landed 
on a window ledge high up on a tower. This place was least likely to be guarded. While it 
seemed like a good idea to have a lot of guards around, Yuffie knew that a good disguise 
was more often than not a much better guard than a dozen of the best men one can 
find.</p><p>The wings were helpful in infiltrating the palace, but they were a hindrance 
when sneaking around. Yuffie had a hard time getting used to moving around without her 
wings knocking things over all the time.</p><p>The top room was just a stockroom full of 
old trunks. It seemed as if nothing was there, yet Yuffie looked through every 
box.</p><p>She would find that lamp. She would find it and get Olette back.</p><p 
style="text-align:center;">- Valiant Hearts -</p><p>"I remember you. You helped Aladdin 
beat Jafar." Jasmine, the princess of Agrabah, sat in front of Kairi. Olette stood guard, 
and Naminé backed up Olette in case of an emergency.</p><p>"It was a bit different than 
what you've probably heard, but yes. We worked together. What's going on here?" Kairi was 
hungry for information. It was incredibly lucky to get both a means to reach the palace and 
a source of information all at once. Fortuna must be shining on her.</p><p>"Mozenrath. He 
is the ruler of the Land of the Black Sand to the east. He found Jafar's lamp and has taken 
over Agrabah. All the others were captured or turned to stone. Can you help us?" The 
princess looked desperate. She and her friends had dealt with a lot of villains up to now, 
even Mozenrath, but Jafar and Mozenrath together bore a dangerous combination.</p><p>"We 
can make use of the flying carpet. He'll be very useful. Our main goal is to get rid of 
Jafar. He's luring the Heartless to this place." When talking to the denizens of worlds, 
Kairi never got into much detail about exactly what the Heartless were. If the people 
asked, she just said they were monsters from the darkness.</p><p>"We need to wait until 
things have calmed down a bit. I've never been inside the palace. I will take you with us 
as a guide." Kairi knew it was risky, but she had little choice. Wandering blindly about in 
Jafar's lair, with another wizard being there too, was suicide.</p><p>"We could use the 
genie Aladdin had," Kairi said. "Has he been captured too?" It didn't take a genius 
tactician to decide that it was best to pitch one genie against another.</p><p>"You saw the 
big crystal in the middle of the palace? That is the Crystal of Ix. Mozenrath uses it to 
trap genies." Jasmine remembered their many encounters with Mozenrath in the past year. "He 
can only trap one at a time, so Jafar is still out and about. Knowing Mozenrath, he'd never 
let something more powerful than himself roam free."</p><p>"You sound like you know a lot 
about this wizard guy. Tell me more. It'll be more advantageous for us if they think we're 
gone. We'll infiltrate the palace just before dawn, so we have plenty of time." Kairi sat 
down. Nobody had their Keyblades out. It was just stupid to needlessly attract the 
attention of the Heartless now.</p><p>"He's scum. Very ambitious scum," the princess said. 
"He wants to rule all of the Seven Deserts. One of those is his own kingdom, the Land of 
the Black Sand. His source of power is a magical glove on his right hand. Without that, he 
cannot do anything. He creates and controls his zombie legion, the mumlocks. He is every 
bit as wicked and evil as Jafar, but not as powerful or smart."</p><p>Jasmine summoned up 
everything they knew about Mozenrath. She was well aware that the three warriors wouldn't 
understand all the details she knew from her adventures, so she kept it to just the 
important facts.</p><p>"And he is obsessed with magic. He has sensors everywhere to 
register magic. I don't know why they aren't going off near you. It makes no 
sense."</p><p>Kairi instinctively knew that it was obvious they wouldn't work on them. This 
was an alien world. Their magic was entirely different from Naminé's and her own. Keyblades 
were special to begin with. This was an enormous advantage.</p><p>"Our magic is special." 
Kairi didn't need to tell her they were from another world. It was one of the rules to not 
carelessly tell people that there were other worlds beside their own. Nobody knew exactly 
how it worked, but once that knowledge spread and became common knowledge, the barrier 
holding the Heartless back weakened considerably. To spread that knowledge was to doom the 
world.</p><p>"Does the carpet respond to any special name?" Kairi wanted to make sure the 
rug actually listened to her. It would be certain death to fall over hundred feet from the 
floating palace and hit the ground. She wanted to avoid that.</p><p>"Just Carpet. We all 
call him that." Jasmine looked at the flying carpet that was lying on the ground, silent 
and unmoving. Was he resting? Did carpets get tired in the first place?</p><p>"Rest until 
one of us wakes you." Kairi stopped when she finally remembered something important. "I'm 
Kairi. The blond girl is Naminé. The brunette is Olette." Turning around again, Kairi left 
to relieve Naminé from her post.</p><p>"What did she say?" Olette didn't look at Kairi, 
just whispered. The number of patrols had increased drastically. They knew someone was here 
and that they meant trouble.</p><p>"A magic-obsessed wizard and an evil genie. Just our 
luck. At least there is no sign of the Heartless showing up without us drawing weapons. No 
sign of the Organization, either." Kairi looked over her shoulder and saw Naminé talking to 
the princess.</p><p>She had told the witch girl that it was their top priority to keep it a 
secret where they came from. Kairi hoped that Naminé had not forgotten that.</p><p>"We 
cannot fight a genie face to face. We can't hurt him. While he can't kill us, you'd be 
surprised what you can live through," Kairi said, and looked at Olette. She wanted to talk 
to her about Yuffie, but this was a mission. Such things had to wait. Saving this world 
from its destruction was their primary goal.</p><p>"It's handy to have you around in times 
like these, Olette. Magic obviously won't help us here. But wizards are prone to be 
physically weak. If it comes down to it, can you do it?" Kairi didn't need to say what she 
had to do. Olette was prepared to kill ever since they had barely escaped with their lives 
from that blond member of the Organization.</p><p>"I won't hesitate to kill him. If I have 
to stain my hands with blood, then at least let it be the blood of evil." Olette clenched 
her fists. If necessary, she would crush him with her bare hands. No more hesitation in 
destroying the enemy. Almost dying once was more than enough.</p><p>"I'm counting on you." 
Kairi tapped Olette's shoulder and took a few steps back. "Naminé, how are you feeling?" 
Kairi was always worried about the girl's mental condition. On a mission, it was crucial 
for her to be in top condition at all times.</p><p>"You're worrying too much, Kairi. You 
saw what I'm capable of in the mock battle. I'm not made of glass." Naminé looked serious, 
and Kairi felt a little stab in her heart. It was true, she was worrying too 
much.</p><p>"But thank you for worrying." Naminé stood up and kissed Kairi on the cheek. 
She was not embarrassed, kissing Kairi in front of someone unknown.</p><p>Jasmine had the 
decency to look away, but she couldn't help but ask herself if those girls were all…that 
way. But that didn't matter now. If they could save Agrabah, then she welcomed all help. 
And they certainly acted like professionals. The clothes, the weapons, their behavior. Not 
even the palace guards were like this.</p><p>"It's 0100 hours. We're starting the 
infiltration at 0130 hours," Kairi said in a low voice. In a world where there were genies 
and sorcerers, the walls probably had ears. "Olette, I have a job for you before we start. 
I trust you can handle it."</p><p>"I'll stir things up somewhere else, right?" It played 
out to their advantage that the Heartless were also attacking the zombies and that the 
people of Agrabah were stone statues for the time being. It all seemed too easy. Like 
someone had expected them to come.</p><p>"Be careful. You're strong and fast, but if either 
Jafar or Mozenrath gets you, we have a problem. I trust you that won't happen." Kairi 
looked at Olette, who just showed she had understood with a nod. "Good luck."</p><p>"I 
don't need luck. But thank you." Olette smiled and vanished down the street. The patrols 
were due in ten minutes, so she had more than enough time to avoid them.</p><p>"Once she 
returns, we will immediately leave for the palace. They will concentrate their forces on 
looking for Olette and they'll have to deal with the Heartless. It's risky, since they 
might see through our plan, but it's the best choice we have to make it into the palace 
undetected," Kairi explained to the princess. She expected Naminé to understand basic 
strategies like this by now.</p><p>Lying down, the three girls could hear and see dozens of 
guards running away from the palace after a while. Kairi estimated that the clash between 
Olette and the mumlocks was taking place near the gate. It would be perfect if the enemy 
were to think that Olette was a reinforcement.</p><p>"Follow me." Kairi waved Naminé, 
Jasmine, and the carpet to go to the roof. Olette would find a way to get to them. It was 
time to leave and to infiltrate the palace.</p><p style="text-align:center;">- Valiant 
Hearts -</p><p>Olette was dealing with much more than she had anticipated. There weren't 
just a few Heartless—there were hundreds of them. It was at the level where she couldn't 
take it easy anymore. Running over the street towards the palace, multiple large-scale 
Heartless were blocking her way. The mumlocks were nothing more than obstacles to her, too 
slow and weak to be a threat.</p><p>Throwing Circle of Life and cutting the massive 
Heartless on the left in half, Olette stepped on the smoldering remains of the killed 
Heartless without hesitation. She used it as a stepping stone and cut off the head of the 
other large Heartless next to her. She had adapted quite a few techniques of her own, but 
this was hardly the moment to test them out.</p><p>Recalling the second blade, Olette 
slashed and hacked her way through the smaller Heartless with ease, eventually using full 
force because it was harder to restrain herself from doing so.</p><p>When she turned a 
corner, Olette found herself in a pinch. There were Heartless everywhere. It was an 
invasion. She couldn't be the only one attracting these Heartless.</p><p>Doing a double 
backflip, Olette did something she would later regret. Taking a deep breath, and slashing 
horizontally at the approaching saber-wielding Heartless, she started to spin around her 
own axis, using Hero's Crest as centrifugal force to keep spinning faster and 
faster.</p><p>Olette let go of Circle of Life, and the blade flew with monstrous speed into 
the masses of the Heartless. She recalled the blade immediately. Repeating the process in 
increasingly faster intervals, she turned the area into a hail of Keyblades.</p><p>But it 
was too hard to keep it going continuously. Instead of slowly spinning out, Olette rammed 
the newly-returned blade into the ground, coming to a brutal hold. She was the only one of 
the three Keybladers who could withstand such an act. Kairi would have surely lost her 
arm.</p><p>Olette's vision was still shaky, but the Heartless were vastly decimated. Using 
both Keyblades as anchors, she rammed them into the wall, then moved up the wall like a 
spider. In times like these, her enormous strength came in handy. The Heartless below 
quickly started to disappear, and the first shadow Heartless appeared on the roof. She 
didn't lose any more time. Olette cut away whatever dared to extend its ugly head out of 
the shadows. It was not much further to the meeting point.</p><p>In fact, she could already 
see them. They were waiting for her. Jumping across the gap between two buildings with 
ease, her landing slightly unsteady, Olette continued to run and cut away the Heartless in 
her path. A big building was before her, and there was already a mass of Heartless on 
it.</p><p>Holding both Keyblades up and jumped much too high for a normal jump across 
buildings, Olette laid waste to the entire roof with one mighty blow. The ceiling crumbled 
from the enormous impact and the Heartless were falling like flies. Olette had just crushed 
everything in her path.</p><p>"Fly!" Olette shouted, and Kairi turned around. When she saw 
her companion, she gave the order to the carpet to fly. She trusted Olette 
blindly.</p><p>Olette ran as fast as she could, jumping from fragment to fragment, making 
it to the next building. In terms of distance, she was ahead of the others, but they were 
on the other side of the street. Throwing both Keyblades at the Heartless behind her, 
Olette jumped with all her might.</p><p>Flying over the street, Olette gained height—and 
then lost it. The ground was coming closer quickly. But she, too, trusted her partners. She 
stretched her arm out, and just before she hit the roof line of the buildings, someone 
grabbed her hand.</p><p>They were flying at maximum speed. Kairi was on her knees on the 
carpet, holding Olette's hand in a tight grip. "Got you."</p><p>But they were not long out 
of danger. A weird type of flying Heartless with wings was right on their tail. The carpet 
did its best to avoid the saber-wielding, flying versions of the Heartless below 
them.</p><p>"I remember those. What are they doing here?" Kairi knew this kind from her 
trip to a world called Neverland. But what were they doing in Agrabah? Were the Heartless 
getting stronger?</p><p>Jasmine was too afraid of these things to even ask what they were. 
At least they couldn't hurt the people of Agrabah. And she had her hands full watching out 
for the flying bastards. It came in handy that she knew how to use a whip.</p><p>Kairi 
pulled Olette up onto the carpet. Naminé was already getting ready. Good. Kairi organized 
the situation and took control. "Fire away! Forget about the ones behind us. Olette, you 
take care of anything that comes close. Naminé, blast free a way to the 
palace."</p><p>"<i>Thundaga!</i>" Naminé shouted, and a rain of lightning annihilated 
potentially hundreds of Heartless. They were quickly replaced, but the carpet was quite 
fast. They were halfway there when Naminé unleashed her second salve of magic and 
obliterated another squadron of Heartless.</p><p>"Where the hell are they all coming from?" 
Olette shouted. Thank God she had mastered the trick of recalling thrown Keyblades. It was 
a mighty important trick right now. If only she had more Keyblades! There was a small delay 
between throwing and recalling a blade.</p><p>"I suppose this is Jafar's work. He was 
behind this the first time as well," Kairi said, and fired several salves of fire magic at 
approaching Heartless. They were still the same brainless foot soldiers as always. Easy to 
kill, but dangerous in numbers.</p><p>"I'm sorry, but this salve is probably going to hit 
the palace!" Naminé shouted, and fired another serving of Thundaga magic right at the 
approaching forces. Part of it hit the palace and caused severe destruction, but the way 
was clear. They successfully made it into the palace and were right above the 
garden.</p><p>"Princess, what's below here?" Kairi had an idea, but they had to act 
quickly. Jafar, if he wasn't the one that had sent the Heartless after them, was very 
likely aware that they had entered the floating palace.</p><p>"Part of the dungeon," 
Jasmine answered, not entirely sure. The palace had been slightly…remodeled by Mozenrath 
and Jafar.</p><p>Kairi nodded, gave Naminé a sign, and had the carpet rise 
higher.</p><p>"<i>Firaga!</i>" Naminé blasted a hole through the ground and Kairi steered 
the carpet right below the garden grounds. There was a multitude of corridors, and Kairi 
took the smallest one. If anyone followed them, they had Naminé for long-range protection 
and Olette for close range. If they couldn't surround them, they had the 
advantage.</p><p>The girls jumped off. The ground was wet and slippery. Their surroundings 
fit the stereotypical images of medieval dungeons a little too closely for Kairi's taste. 
The walls were made of thick dark bricks. This route must lead right to an exit in the 
ground, considering that part of the dungeon was still on the ground below 
them.</p><p>"Princess, are there any secret passages to the throne room?" Kairi knew they 
had to act first before the confusion of breaking into the palace was gone. Not even a 
genie could look everywhere at once. And the palace, just as Kairi guessed, had countless 
corridors and secret passages.</p><p>"Yes, follow me."</p><p style="text-align:center;">- 
Valiant Hearts -</p><p>"Where were you, Jafar? There are intruders in the palace! And the 
city is full of some kind of weird black magic creatures. My sensors are useless now!" 
Mozenrath walked up and down in the throne room, the genie quietly floating a few feet in 
the distance, listening to the sorcerer's ranting.</p><p>"I was casting a barrier around 
the palace to prevent said creatures from coming in. They are called the Heartless. They 
follow the Keybladers, very dangerous individuals, everywhere they go." Jafar had not told 
the wizard too much of other worlds and of the Heartless. Mozenrath didn't seem interested 
at all anyway. He was satisfied ruling just the Seven Deserts. What a narrow-minded and 
<i>small</i> wizard he was. Weak both in power and ambition.</p><p>"I do not care who they 
are! I want them gone. Nothing shall stand between me and my rule over the Seven Deserts!" 
Mozenrath growled. "Genie! Get rid of them!"</p><p>Jafar pretended to obey and vanished 
into thin air. What a stupid man Mozenrath was. To think he could command <i>him</i>, the 
greatest wizard ever to be, like some common creature! How surprised that pathetic wizard 
would be when he learned that it was he, Jafar, who would rule over Agrabah, the Seven 
Deserts, and more—with the power of the Heartless.</p><p>Reappearing in the royal treasure 
chamber, he looked around. The girl was quite clever. Even he had trouble finding her when 
he really wanted to. Tired of the little game of hide and seek, he simply spoke 
up.</p><p>"Girl. You must hurry with finding the lamp. The wizard is getting impatient. I 
do not know how much longer I can stall him." Jafar's scheme was coming along nicely. "He 
has ordered me to make the Keybladers his allies. He wants the Keyblades. I fear the worst 
for your friends if he succeeds." Jafar didn't know as much about the Keyblades as Yuffie, 
but it was enough to know that they were desirable tools.</p><p>Yuffie, hidden under a pile 
of gold, freed herself and stood up. She would soon find the lamp. It had not been in the 
towers or the treasure room. The genie had taken away her wings. She no longer needed them, 
and they were a bother while looking for the lamp anyway.</p><p>"If you do not want to kill 
him, and I understand well a good girl like you wouldn't, there is this…crystal of his that 
we could use to trap him. He might very well use the crystal and try to trap me. Then your 
wishes shall never be granted, and he will eventually rule over all of the Seven Deserts…" 
He had to get rid of Mozenrath fast. Up until now, Jafar had been able to deceive him, but 
who knew how much longer Mozenrath would resist the urge to make a wish that changed 
Jafar's plans greatly.</p><p>Yuffie's expression changed when the genie mentioned that she 
could lose her wishes if the wizard trapped the genie. She would prevent that and kill him. 
All her thoughts were concentrated on Olette. Kairi didn't deserve her. She had Naminé, and 
even Tifa and Aerith.</p><p>She…she had nobody. Yuffie had no one other than Olette. And 
she would not allow the one person she loved to be taken away from her. Not by Kairi. Not 
by anyone else.</p><p>"I will get rid of him. But you need to stop him from getting to the 
Keybladers first." Yuffie looked around. There were barely any guards in the palace, and it 
was extremely unlikely they would check the treasure room. She was safe here.</p><p>"I will 
do all I can." Jafar bowed and vanished into thin air. Everything was going exactly as 
planned…</p><p>Well, not quite everything.</p><p>Mozenrath was much smarter than Jafar gave 
him credit for. But nothing of the knowledge he possessed stemmed from his own 
achievements. A small winged cat floated next to the young wizard, sitting on the throne. 
It was just so…predictable how things would end if Jafar had his way with them. It had been 
time to spice things up a little.</p><p>"So Jafar is trying to remove the lamp from my 
reach. It doesn't matter. I still have the Crystal of Ix. No genie or magical being can 
escape it. Except you, Chaos." Mozenrath turned to the ever-smiling cat.</p><p>"Oh, no need 
to thank me." The cat named Chaos started to laugh. "I just…made things a little 
less…<i>predictable!</i>" He floated off and vanished into thin air, only his laughter 
remaining in the grand hall.</p><p>"It's time to meet those intruders." Mozenrath didn't 
know the palace well, but Chaos had been very helpful. With a big swing of his glove, he 
covered himself with dark energy and vanished. Jafar would not have his way with him, oh 
no.</p><p>When he appeared right below the throne room, he was instantly forced to the 
ground, and rolled onto his back. Two large blades loomed over him, threatening to cut off 
his head. Whoever the intruders were, they were well prepared and…he saw a familiar 
face.</p><p>"Chaos! You betrayed me!" Mozenrath cursed.</p><p>"Oh no. I just made…" He 
never got to finish his line.</p><p>"Things less predictable? I should have known!" 
Mozenrath hissed. Looking over his shoulder, he could barely believe what he was seeing. 
Three girls, armed to the teeth with long blade-like weapons, and Princess Jasmine. He had 
hit the ground so hard, he was sure a guy twice his size had knocked him down.</p><p>He 
then took a deep breath, regaining his calm. "I've come to offer a deal."</p><p>"What could 
you possibly offer, Mozenrath?" Jasmine stepped in front and talked to the wizard on the 
ground. Olette was ready to cut off his head if he made a suspicious move.</p><p>"Your 
friends' lives." He grinned diabolically. Jasmine looked at Kairi with pleading eyes, but 
Kairi pulled her back.</p><p>"What do you want in exchange?" she asked.</p><p>While it was 
Kairi's policy not to mess with alien worlds' affairs too much, it also was her priority 
for everyone to stay alive. And "everyone" was, first and foremost, her own team.</p><p>"I 
want you to help me trap Jafar in the large crystal in the center of the palace. He is both 
our enemy. After that, we will go our separate ways. Nothing more." Mozenrath was sure they 
would take the deal.</p><p>"Not good enough. We help you, you release your prisoners, and 
tell us how to permanently get rid of Jafar," Kairi said, and winked Olette. The blades 
moved closer together.</p><p>Mozenrath had problems talking without the edges cutting into 
his throat now. "Okay, okay. You win. To get rid of a genie, you have to destroy his lamp. 
But Chaos told me that the lamp is being hunted by an outsider, with Jafar's help. One of 
you?" He was still held on the ground, but Olette now giving Kairi a questioning 
look.</p><p>"Not one of us. We were the first to infiltrate the palace." Kairi gave the 
other two a meaningful glare. They had better not contradict Kairi. This guy didn't need to 
know that there were only three of them.</p><p>"You need to lure Jafar to the balcony or 
somewhere outside. The crystal's tracking beam cannot pass solid matter." He only told them 
what they needed to know. After Jafar was in the crystal, and his power was at Mozenrath's 
command, he would annihilate them. For he was not bound to the silly rules of the 
genies.</p><p>"If you do not honor your deal—" Kairi pointed the edge of Oathkeeper at the 
throat of the wizard. "We <i>will</i> kill you. Do not fool yourself into thinking your 
magic will work on us. These weapons are special. Not even a genie is immune to them." 
Kairi was lying her ass off, but Mozenrath seemed to buy it.</p><p>He knew nothing about 
these outsiders, and he had never even heard of weapons like these. They…resembled a 
mixture of a sword and a giant…key? No matter what kind of weapon it was, they were not 
joking about using them. But what did it matter? They might resist the magic itself, but 
one could do much more than that with the power of a genie.</p><p>"I shall wait at the 
crystal. Once you lured Jafar outside, the crystal will react by itself and capture him. 
After that, we will be enemies." Mozenrath had done well, not telling anyone for what 
purpose he was trapping Jafar. "After we trap him, we will have all the time in the 
world…to clear our differences." Yes. He'd have time to destroy those pesky 
outsiders.</p><p>Kairi smelled something fishy. A villain <i>never</i> made a fair deal. He 
would betray them as soon as Jafar no longer posed the bigger threat. But for now, there 
was little choice.</p><p>"Olette, hit his face. Make it look like he escaped us narrowly." 
Kairi gave the order to beat the surprised wizard without the slightest regard for the fact 
that he was human too.</p><p>Olette clenched her fist and hit the wizard so hard that he 
was lifted off his feet and crashed in the wall. A couple hits later, his face was littered 
with injuries. Letting her knuckles crack, Olette took position for one last hit when Kairi 
held her back.</p><p>"That's enough. Go, wizard. We will do our part. You do yours. We will 
come after you next."</p><p>Kairi decided that if they were involved this far into other 
worlds, they might as well clear up the mess Jafar had caused. The Heartless must have 
surrounded the castle in the thousands by now. Whatever held them back, once they got rid 
of it, Naminé had quite a job to do.</p><p>With a hissing sound, the wizard vanished as 
quickly as he had come. Jasmine was not sure if she was afraid of the toughness of these 
girls or simply amazed. Maybe a little of both. They seemed not to think of Mozenrath as 
human or even a living creature. The red-haired girl giving the order had been as cold as 
stone the whole time, and the brunette had monstrous strength and followed every order as 
faithfully as a religious fanatic. The power of the blond girl…she had seen that before. 
She was wielding magic powerful enough to make Jasmine think the girl was a 
witch.</p><p>"Naminé, you protect the princess. I am the only Keyblader that Jafar knows. 
As it was I who sealed him, he will try and take revenge on me. Olette, you keep an eye on 
Mozenrath. If he tries something suspicious, kill him. There are always other ways to get 
rid of Jafar."</p><p>It was just how things were done. There was no justice in a fight of 
life and death. The results counted, and Kairi was willing to accept the moral burden of 
using underhanded tactics. To begin with, the belief that the one playing fair and square 
won was a dream of fiction. It didn't work like that in real life.</p><p>"Princess, please 
get somewhere safe. Naminé, never leave her side. If something happens, try to track down 
one of us. Olette, you know what to do." Looking from one girl to another, Kairi added with 
a slight smile. "I trust you two. Go!"</p><p>Kairi took off on her own, just as Olette did. 
As the two separated at the next corner, Naminé was left behind with the princess and the 
carpet.</p><p>"We will be safe further down. Carpet, can you take us?" Naminé kept her grip 
tightly on her Keyblade. She was more useful in an actual fight. She didn't have the 
physical ability or stamina to participate in missions like these, but that was okay. They 
were a team. They covered each other's weaknesses.</p><p>The carpet took off and took them 
further down, deeper into the complicated dungeons.</p><p>Way above them, Olette was on her 
way to the room in the center of the palace. It was her bad luck that there didn't seem to 
be a direct way there. She reached the throne room and found it empty. Well, no other 
choice, then. Using her Keyblades, Olette simply crushed the closest wall and proceeded 
further. If she had to break every wall in the building, she would reach the center chamber 
with the crystal.</p><p>Kairi was at a loss. How could she attract Jafar's attention? The 
plan had been to avoid that very fact until they found a way to defeat him without directly 
exchanging blows. But now…she was standing in the garden, alone. Jafar didn't seem to fall 
for the trap.</p><p>And something was wrong. Kairi could feel it. There was something odd 
going on. She remembered what the wizard had said. "An outsider…what did he mean by 
that?"</p><p>Was it possible that King Mickey was here? But why would he hide the lamp? 
Were there other Keybladers?</p><p>Olette could answer Kairi's question. In front of her 
was Yuffie. But why was she here?</p><p>"I was looking for you, Olette!" Yuffie ran towards 
Olette, trying to embrace her. The brunette immediately jumped back and directed one 
Keyblade at her.</p><p>Was this Jafar's work? Was it really Yuffie, and not just something 
that looked exactly like her? It made sounds when it walked and it had a shadow. But…how 
and why would Yuffie be here? No. <i>No!</i> She couldn't be deceived.</p><p>"It's really 
me!" Yuffie was getting desperate. With each step she came closer, the girl she loved moved 
further away.</p><p>Jafar appeared right behind Yuffie. "This is but a mirage Mozenrath has 
created to fool you," he whispered in the ear of the girl. The ninja turned around and 
seemed shocked. The power of the wizard was that great? But if this <i>was</i> Olette…why 
didn't she recognize Yuffie?</p><p>The outsider who was looking for the lamp…Olette now 
realized who the "outsider" was. This Yuffie must be real, and Jafar was manipulating 
her.</p><p>"Yuffie! He's evil! He's Jafar, the wizard that Kairi beat in the past. Don't 
believe anything he says! We must destroy the lamp!" She had to get Yuffie away from 
him!</p><p>"See? He doesn't want you to free me. He is afraid of losing his power. He must 
be using the image of one of the Keybladers to confuse you!" Jafar was still whispering so 
Olette couldn't hear.</p><p>"Don't listen to him! Get away from him! We need to destroy the 
lamp and kill him!" Olette yelled and took a step towards Yuffie.</p><p>"He wants to kill 
me so that you cannot get your wishes granted. He doesn't want anyone but himself to have a 
genie if it comes down to it. His greed knows no bounds!" Jafar was grinning 
diabolically.</p><p>Yuffie threw a few shuriken at Olette's feet. Jumping back, the 
Keyblader was left with no other choice. If Yuffie was already under his influence, Olette 
just had to beat her and take her to safety.</p><p>But as she ran towards Yuffie, Jafar 
snapped his fingers, and Olette vanished in a flash of light.</p><p>"I made it disappear, 
but there is no telling what else Mozenrath will do to confuse you! Don't believe your 
eyes, don't believe what you see. I know his powers, I can help you," Jafar whispered. 
Yuffie nodded and took a deep breath. They had to go and find the lamp before it was too 
late!</p><p>When she opened her eyes, Olette felt like she had just been run over by 
something really, really big. Still, she jumped up and checked the area. Nobody was there. 
Where were Yuffie and Jafar? Why hadn't Jafar killed her? She was still in the same spot, 
and everything seemed normal. Pinching her arm, Olette twitched. It was real. It hurt like 
hell.</p><p>Summoning both Keyblades, Olette started running. It was oddly quiet. How long 
had she been out of it? What had happened in the meantime? Where was everyone? She finally 
reached the throne room, after minutes of running around. And finally…</p><p>Mozenrath. He 
was standing there, deep in thought. He didn't seem to notice her. Should she take the 
chance and get rid of him? She thought about it—if he had the leisure to stand around here, 
then either the deal was off and he was going to betray them, or it was already over and 
done with. So she really out to just go ahead and get rid of him. But where were Kairi and 
Naminé?</p><p>Olette would be able to sneak behind him. A surprise assault was the only way 
to get him. He was still a wizard, and she had her problems with such enemies.</p><p>Taking 
the opportunity, Olette ran at full speed towards the wizard, who noticed her an instant 
too late. With a powerful kick, he was slammed against the throne itself and landed on the 
ground. Olette was already over him.</p><p>"Where are the others? What happened to Jafar? 
What did you do, wizard?" She pointed one Keyblade at his throat, the other just inches 
away from cutting off his gauntleted arm.</p><p>But the wizard just laughed. "Fool! Your 
friends are no longer alive. I'm surprised you're still here. It's…been quite a while." He 
grinned wider. "You cannot kill me. Genie!" he yelled.</p><p>And nothing happened. What was 
wrong? Where was Jafar?</p><p>It was Olette's turn to smile. "I thought this would be 
difficult. To trap the genie. To get rid of the wizard. But it seems like it will be much 
easier than we thought. I give you one last chance. Where. Is. Everyone?" Olette exerted a 
lot of pressure on the stomach of the wizard by stomping on it. "<i>Talk!</i>"</p><p>But 
the wizard just laughed. He would never talk. "I am immortal! You cannot kill me, pesky 
little girl!"</p><p>"We shall see about that!" It only took a single swing. It almost 
seemed too easy to be true. Blood spilled on her legs and shoes, and it quickly covered the 
ground. The wizard had his throat slashed and was dying. No immortality. No genie. He was 
simply dying. But the true threat was still out there—Jafar.</p><p>Olette swung her 
Keyblade to get the blood off. The wizard was no longer alive. After all, he was just a 
sidekick to Jafar. But what should she do now? The wizard had not left her any clue. Maybe 
she should look for Kairi and Naminé first…</p><p>Turning around, Olette felt like someone 
had just turned her stomach inside out.</p><p>"Mozenrath? But, I just…" Swinging around, 
Olette felt like throwing up. Right before her was the corpse of Kairi. "But…he talked…and 
the body…how…why…?" Olette felt her head spin.</p><p>And the wizard took the chance. Firing 
a beam of dark magic at Olette, the girl was thrown against one of the large pillars at the 
corner of the room. Why…why…was it Kairi…?</p><p>The wizard didn't need to take any 
precautions anymore. The girl was as good as dead. As he aimed his glove at her and charged 
up magical energy, he planned to kill her in one blow. He was not bound to some silly 
rules. He could do as he pleased! "What a stupid brat you are to fall for my trap. And 
look! You murdered your friend! What a nice turn of events!" Mozenrath started to laugh. He 
laughed so loud that it rang in Olette's ears.</p><p>Olette gritted her teeth. It was all 
his fault…his fault! The bastard didn't just deserve to die. No, she would kill him with 
bare hands. He was much too slow if she anticipated his attacks. And she would find a way 
to save…to revive Kairi somehow. Somehow…</p><p>Mozenrath was surprised when the girl 
started to run towards the entrance at amazing speed. How could a little girl be so fast? 
He aimlessly fired several salves of magic, but all missed. The girl changed directions so 
often, it was impossible to hit her. He had to get out of here. Turning tail, Mozenrath 
started to run—but he was no match for the much quicker Olette.</p><p>With a brutal impact, 
Olette landed right on his back, throwing him on the ground. That glove was dangerous. 
Grabbing his arm, Olette roared with anger and broke the wizard's arm, who screamed out in 
pain. She then grabbed his throat.</p><p>The wizard was already pale. "Stop! Wait, I can 
offer you a deal!" he pleaded.</p><p>"You cannot revive the dead, wizard," Olette said, and 
slowly tightened her grip. The wizard struggled, tried to free himself, but one of his arms 
was broken and he was nowhere near strong enough to get rid of the girl. She didn't even 
seem to feel the punches she took.</p><p>He couldn't breathe. His throat was being crushed. 
With his last breath, he cursed. "<i>Damn you, Jafar…!</i>"</p><p>With a loud crack, his 
neck broke.</p><p>Olette sat on the corpse, looking down on her hands. Not just his 
blood…but that of Kairi was on her hands…how…how could she explain this to everyone? 
To…Naminé? How?</p><p>Steps on the cold marble floor got her attention. What now? Tense, 
Olette got up and recalled her Keyblades, ready for anything but what was coming.</p><p>It 
was Yuffie, accompanied by the evil genie, Jafar. Just <i>what</i> was going on here? Why 
was Yuffie…?</p><p>Yuffie stopped and looked at the brunette with an equally shocked face. 
"What…have you done…?"</p><p>Her eyes went to the corpse near the throne. Kairi's corpse. 
And then…to the corpse of the wizard. Olette would not be fooled again. She had to make 
sure that this was really Yuffie.</p><p>"Yuffie, why are we staying at Aerith's place?" It 
was a question as good as any other. If Yuffie could not answer this…then she was just 
another trap.</p><p>"Why…did you kill Kairi and Naminé?" Yuffie ignored the 
question.</p><p>Olette's Keyblades dropped. What…but…she was afraid of turning around. 
Afraid that what Yuffie had said would come true. That she had fallen for the same trick 
<i>again</i>. She had felt the body of the wizard, she knew it couldn't have been a trick! 
It must be a lie…</p><p>But her eyes were not lying. Looking behind her, Olette stared at 
the strangled corpse of Naminé. Her face was distorted with disbelief and surprise, the 
eyes wide open in terror. Olette sank to her knees. It couldn't be true. No…<i>it couldn't 
be true</i>…</p><p>Light steps echoed through the room. Yuffie was coming closer. Olette's 
will to fight had left her. She had killed the two people she had considered true friends 
before any other. And now they were gone…even if they could be revived somehow…they would 
not forgive her. Nobody would forgive her. It was her own rashness that got her into this. 
It was her fault!</p><p>Yuffie fell to her knees in front of Olette. Hugging her, Olette 
finally comprehended the full truth behind her actions. She had killed the other two 
Keybladers. It was by her hands that she killed Kairi and Naminé, in cold blood and with 
brutal means. Naminé's expression burned deep inside her mind.</p><p>"Don't worry…it's not 
your fault. It was the wizard's doing…" Yuffie's voice was broken. Olette could feel her 
body shaking.</p><p>And then she felt a sharp pain in her back. She couldn't breathe. Her 
body went numb. Yuffie let her go, and Olette dropped to the ground. She could feel blood 
running over her back.</p><p>"Thank you for letting me kill you!" Yuffie laughed and 
laughed. "I don't need you anymore, Olette! I can have anything now! I can revive the dead, 
get the love of whomever I want, and live forever! I have the genie now!" Yuffie shouted in 
a crazy voice.</p><p>Olette's vision blurred. Was this the end? Yuffie, laughing at her 
foolishness. Yuffie, standing there, laughing with the corpses of the three Keybladers 
before her. Olette turned with the last of her power, wanting to see the faces of her 
friends one more time.</p><p>And as she turned, she saw the unfathomable truth. They had 
been decoys. Puppets. The illusion dispelled—they were just zombie soldiers. Olette had run 
straight into a trap. It was all Jafar's doing. Manipulating Yuffie…luring Olette 
here…making her think that she killed her best friends…and finally…killing 
<i>her</i>.</p><p>Olette could no longer feel anything. Her vision left her, and her 
consciousness faded away slowly.</p><p>If only she hadn't been so rash…</p>
