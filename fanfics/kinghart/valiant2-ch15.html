<a href="../kinghart/valiant2-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><p align='center'><I>You
and You and I – </I></P><p align='center'><I>Under
the Moonlight</I></P><P>“That's
it for today.”</P><P>Naminè
was more than just tired. Training had been going on for over five
hours that day. Aerith was a nice person, but too ambitious when it
came to magic. It was past noon, time for lunch, and training was
finally over.</P><P>Kairi's
training must be still going on. Would she go and see it? It wasn't
that far a detour anyway, so she decided to go. Aerith would go back
in advance to prepare lunch. Tifa was probably still training Olette,
or rather torturing her, as she called it.</P><P>“You're
making good progress, Naminè. I think you'll have fire done before
the week ends.” Aerith was smiling at Naminè, proud of her
apprentice.</P><P>“I'm
going to look how Kairi is doing. I'll come back with her.”</P><P>“It's
her first day after recovering. Give her a slap on the head if she's
overdoing things…actually, I'm sure she is.” Aerith sighed and
tried to imagine Naminè actually slapping Kairi on the head.</P><P>Hilarious.
So hilarious that Aerith started to smile so widely that Naminè gave
her a weird gaze before she left. It was still around noon, so there
was enough time for lunch.</P><P>Naminè
made her way from the canyon all the way up to the castle grounds.
The place was a mess back from when Hollow Bastion had been
Maleficent's headquarters. Leon had decided to not repair the place
and instead use it as training grounds.</P><P>Naminè
could hear swords clashing from a distance and it got louder when she
got closer. That was the sound of fighting, and there was little
question who was fighting.</P><P>The
last corner, Naminè came upon an amazing sight. Leon was running
towards the castle walls, his sword magically enlarged to an enormous
size. It was his special attack. To use that in training was quite
extreme.</P><P>Kairi
was in front of Leon, standing near the castle walls. Leon was about
to strike, and Kairi was a sitting duck. Naminè was following Leon's
movements. He looked serious enough to make her think it was a real
battle.</P><P>The
finishing strike came. And Leon ran blindly in the trap. Kairi fired
gravity magic on the ground and jumped to the side, evading Leon's
blow. The swordsman hit the gravity spell and got his sword stuck. He
decided instantly that it was better to break up the power-up spell,
which freed his sword.</P><P>Kairi
was already close enough to prevent him from using his power-up
again. He had to defend against a series of blows, randomly coming
vertically and horizontally. There was little room for a
counterattack.</P><P>“<I>Fire!</I>”
Leon yelled, and Kairi backed off, anticipating a fireball.</P><P>But
nothing came. Instead, Leon closed in and hit a surprised Kairi with
a kick to the ground. It was useless to disarm a Keyblader so he
prevented her from attacking by using two gravity spells on her
wrists. Kairi was unable to get up, and with Leon pointing his sword
at her throat, the fight was over.</P><P>“Kairi!”
Naminè was rather shocked to what lengths they went.</P><P>“Naminè?”
Kairi looked to the side, seeing the blond girl running over to her.</P><P>“Are
you all right? That looked like a real fight, you got me scared for a
moment!” Naminè knelt next to Kairi.</P><P>She
had bruises and cuts all over the place. Leon was definitely going
too far with this!</P><P>Leon
undid the gravity binding and knelt down. He was sweating and
exhausted. He had only a few bruises, displaying his superior combat
abilities. They were still far apart, Kairi and he. She would have to
go through a lot of training until he had to be really serious.</P><P>“Good
work. I didn't anticipate the gravity bind. But that's useless if
your opponent can choose the length and the shape of his weapon. Keep
that in mind. Get some rest, I'll see you tomorrow,” Leon said and
stood up, slowly walking away.</P><P>Naminè
could only listen and watch in astonishment. She didn't like Leon,
but he didn't seem like a bad person. But his training seemed to be
much worse than Tifa's or Aerith's.</P><P>Kairi
was exhausted. It was nothing new that Leon beat her, but it really
was surprising that he praised her tactics. The main point of their
battles was not to enhance physical or magical abilities but to gain
tactical experience. No power in the world meant anything if the
opponent could see every single move in advance.</P><P>With
Olette and Naminè on her side, Kairi was more serious than ever. She
wanted to show them that she was trying her best, not allowing
herself to fail like she had on their last mission. One day, she
would function as the tactical head for those two. She couldn't
neglect training her body and mind, though. She would ask Tifa to let
her train together with Olette. It wasn't enough if she trained
thrice a week with Leon. There was enough time to train at least once
with Tifa and Aerith. That still left her two days to rest.</P><P>“You're
pushing yourself too hard, Kairi. Aerith told me I should give you a
slap on the head if you do. I won't, but promise me that you take
better care of yourself!” Naminè was worried Kairi was overdoing
things.</P><P>“If
I don't train hard, I'll never be strong enough to take on…him.”
Kairi had not-so-fond memories of him.</P><P>“Even
if you don't train this hard, you aren't alone. I also do what I can.
Even Olette!”</P><P>“You…don't
understand that.”</P><P>“Then
explain it to me!” Naminè looked at Kairi in incomprehension.</P><P>“Maybe
later,” Kairi said and got up. She had asked them to go with her to

<I>that</I> place today.</P><P>“You're
so stubborn!” Naminè complained, but followed the redhead.</P><P>“I
know. And you're as curious as a cat.”</P><P>“What
does that mean?” Naminè had never heard of the saying.</P><P>“You'll
find out one day.” Kairi had gone back to smiling.</P><P>Naminè
made a sulking expression. “Why do I feel like you're making fun of
me?”</P><P>Kairi
said nothing, but giggled. Her body hurt and Aerith would probably
scold her for being reckless. What Tifa would say…well, she already
knew. Tifa would, as usual, threaten to beat up Leon.</P><P>The
two girls made their way over to their home. Naminè linked her arm
with Kairi's, doing so without any deeper intent. It didn't seem to
bother Kairi.</P><P>“You'd
love to stay like that forever, wouldn't you?” Kairi was teasing
her.</P><P>“If
you don't mind.” Naminè was still cautious about such things, but
Kairi seemed to be much less distanced than before.</P><P>“I
do, but we can stay like this until we get home.”</P><P>Their
relationship had changed. Kairi knew that Naminè had a romantic
interest in her, but nothing good would come out of just pretending
it would go away if she ignored it long enough.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Kairi
was taking a shower first, while Olette and Naminè were talking, or
rather, arguing in their room.</P><P>“Now
stop sulking, Olette. I was just walking with her.”</P><P>Olette
had seen them from the windows walking, arms linked together. She
knew that it wasn't a big deal, but she still played the offended and
sulking one.</P><P>“You're
so lucky. I want to walk like that with Kairi too.”</P><P>“Are
you sure? Didn't you complain five minutes ago that Tifa is killing
you and you don't want to move a single step—”
Naminè knew that Olette was pretending. It was so obvious, she
decided to play along and tease her a bit.</P><P>“That
is different! Who knows what you two did before you got to the
house!”</P><P>“Kairi
said I shouldn't tell. You would go crazy.” Naminè had to suppress
her laughter, and turned away from Olette.</P><P>“I
knew it.” Olette buried her face in her pillow, trying to avoid
showing her big smile to Naminè.</P><P>Naminè
climbed up the ladder and sat down on Olette's back. The brunette
moaned from the sudden weight on her back. Her sore muscles were just
as bad as the day before and Naminè only made it worse. To top it
all off, Naminè started tickling Olette. And what a victim she had
found herself!</P><P>“Get
off me, you witch,” Olette was laughing while saying so.</P><P>“Force
me, you brute!” Naminè continued tickling her.</P><P>Olette
tried to move around and throw Naminè off and it worked. They
forcefully switched positions and now Olette was on top of Naminè,
tickling her. The blond girl was not quite as sensitive as Olette and
could resist laughing.</P><P>“I
knew you two were close, but I didn't knew this close.”</P><P>Both
girls looked down, seeing Kairi in the door frame. It was
embarrassing off the scale. It certainly looked like they were doing

<I>that</I>.</P><P>“She
started it!” It was the first thing that came to Olette's mind.</P><P>“We
were just teasing each other!” Naminè only made it worse.</P><P>“Wow,
hold it. I didn't want details.” Kairi knew exactly what it looked
like, but it was too funny to see the girls embarrassed like that.</P><P>“It
isn't like that!” Olette got away from Naminè, and was glaring
red.</P><P>“Olette's
right!” Naminè was no less red than Olette.</P><P>“Lunch
is ready, come down, you two lovebirds.” Kairi felt good. It was so
much better to deal with all this once she had made up her mind. It
was now only a matter of…telling them.</P><P>“We
aren't lovebirds!” both girls said simultaneously.</P><P>“Yes,
of course.” Kairi smiled and left, going down the stairs.</P><P>It
only took the girls a minute to get down, still embarrassed over the
misunderstanding and looking rather awkwardly at each other.</P><P>“This
is your fault!” Naminè pointed at Olette.</P><P>“It's
not!” Olette didn't want to argue about this anymore. It was
embarrassing, especially in front of Kairi.</P><P>“It's
okay, I know it only looked like that,” Kairi said and rolled her
eyes. The girls really took some things too seriously.</P><P>Aerith
had observed everything and was smiling to herself. Tifa was in the
shower and missed everything. She would tell her later. It was good
to see the girls getting along.</P><P>“You
three look like you're having fun.”</P><P>“Looks
like Naminè is not only learning magic from you, Aerith. What else
are you teaching her?” Kairi gave Aerith a guilty look.</P><P>“I
don't know what you're talking about.” Aerith was innocent and
Kairi knew it.</P><P>Lunchtime
flew by. They talked about nothing but how Naminè was taking after
Aerith, and Kairi had a lot of fun comparing Olette to Tifa. That
only led to Naminè and Olette joining forces and comparing Kairi to
Leon, who was equally stubborn. The redhead had more to say and in
the end, the girls accused each other of being younger counterparts
of the adults. It led to three sulking girls and a laughing Aerith.</P><P>Tifa
joined them when they were just past comparing Olette to her and
everyone looked at her with wide eyes. Tifa was confused and asked
what it was all about, and everyone but Olette started laughing.</P><P>They
girls went back into their rooms when lunch was over, while Aerith
and Tifa went out for their own training session.</P><P>“Do
I really act like Tifa?” Olette was complaining to Naminè, who was
lying on her own bed below Olette's, and reading the novel she got
from Aerith.</P><P>“Maybe.”
Naminè answered halfheartedly, occupied with her own thoughts.</P><P>“It's
not true, isn't it? I'm not that irresponsible!”</P><P>“Maybe.”</P><P>“Naminè,
are you even listening?”</P><P>“Maybe.”</P><P>Olette
climbed down the ladder, leaning over Naminè and finally getting her
to look away from her novel.</P><P>“Am
I like Tifa?” Olette was thinking that it wasn't too bad.</P><P>“I
don't know. I do think you're sort of like her. But that's not a bad
thing, really.”</P><P>Naminè
liked Olette, and if she was like Tifa, what did it matter?</P><P>“I
was just thinking…have I always been like that?”</P><P>Olette
was thinking that maybe being in this world was changing her. Maybe
being with Kairi, with everyone else, was changing her. But was it a
good or a bad thing? Meeting Kairi certainly was a good thing.</P><P>“I
don't know. But I'm changing too. I don't think we are changing for
the worse.”</P><P>Awkward
silence fell over the two. Olette sat down on Naminè's bed. Should
she talk to her about it? They were in the same boat, and what Tifa
had said still bothered her.</P><P>“It's
weird like this.”</P><P>Naminè
could guess what Olette meant. She felt the same. How long would this
go on? How long would they have to wait?</P><P>“It's
up to Kairi…”</P><P>The
atmosphere was going downhill. They both didn't know what to say.
They each knew the other liked Kairi, and they knew Kairi would have
to choose.</P><P>The
door opened and the very subject of their troubles entered. Kairi
looked rather confused, seeing Olette down next to Naminè.</P><P>“Want
to go to that place? I asked you yesterday, so…”</P><P>“I'll
go.” Olette was up in a second.</P><P>“Me
too.” Naminè put a bookmark in her novel and stood up.</P><P>It
was still light out and it would take a bit longer for the sun to
set. That place was the best when the sun was going down, but it
wouldn't hurt to go up a bit earlier.</P><P>Kairi
was nervous. She had made up her mind, even if it meant completely
changing their relationship forever. Her thoughts went back to the
night they got back, the moment Yuffie told her about Olette.</P><p 
align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“I
thought a lot about it, Kairi, but no matter how much I want to deny
it, I love you.”</P><P>Silence.
It was an earsplitting silence, like it had occurred after a terrible
accident. Neither said anything, the silence just continued. Kairi
finally centered her thoughts and tried to answer.</P><P>“So
that's what she said?”</P><P>Nothing
else came out. Kairi was at a loss for words. Why didn't she notice
it? Why hadn't Olette said anything?</P><P>“Well,
I guess my time is up, I'll be leaving. Sleep well, Kairi, and
welcome home.”</P><P>The
black-haired woman left through the window, and Kairi was alone with
her thoughts.</P><P>“Olette…why…?”</P><P>Kairi
could feel her heart ache. Was it an error to trust Olette? A error
to act around her like that? But…</P><P>Sleep
was completely out of the question now. Kairi glared at the ceiling,
burying her face in her hands. Just what should she do now?</P><P>“First
Naminè…for no reason and now…Olette…<I>why</I>, dammit?!”</P><P>Kairi's
feelings went from confused to rage. Why did one girl after another
force their unrequited feelings on her? How would she deal with them?
Did she have any feelings for them?</P><P>Her
mind was clouded with anger. Just why did they both have to fall in
love with her? What was so special about her? Sometimes she wished to
be a boring regular girl, without all these burdens.</P><P>That
thought woke bad memories. Memories of when she wanted to run away,
throw away everything and give up. And she had promised herself to
never let it happen again.</P><P>Taking
a deep breath, Kairi tried to clear her mind. It was wrong to get all
angry over it. There was nothing she could do about the feelings of
others. But this situation couldn't go on. If she told Naminè she
wanted to stay friends, would she do the same with Olette? But it was
already awkward enough, knowing one girl loved her. Wasn't that…just
running away?</P><P>She
had never bothered with romantic feelings or the sort. Asking Aerith
or Tifa would only lead to them encouraging her to look for those
things herself. One couldn't explain feelings to others. Maybe she
just wasn't ready for it. Maybe she would never be. Was is right to
have the girls waiting forever for her? Was it fair? Did she want to
do that to them?</P><P>“No…”</P><P>But
would telling them so ruin their friendship? It surely would change
their relationship forever, irreparably. Did Kairi really want that?
It had only been so long since she got to know them, and there was
still a lot she didn't know about them. Would they hate her? Would
they walk away from her?</P><P>It
was a difficult choice. But wouldn't making them wait forever make
them hate her even more? It would be, as a friend, a terrible act to
do.</P><P>Kairi
had been alone for a long time. Even if it meant being alone again,
she had to make a choice.</P><P>Her
thoughts wandered back and forth for so long, she didn't even know
how soon the morning came. In the end, her choice was clear. It was
for the best this way.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>It
was still early to go to the observation deck, but Kairi had
something else to say. Something that was weighting on her shoulders,
something that they had to admit to themselves or they would never
get over it.</P><P>“The
air is so clean up here.”</P><P>The
deck was as beautiful as ever. High above Hollow Bastion, one could
feel the wind and the sun, could see the whole town.</P><P>“Did
you guys ever ask yourself what's down there?” Naminè pointed at
the canyon.</P><P>“Aerith
said that they tried to measure the ground once, but they couldn't
reach it. It seems like a bottomless hole,” Kairi explained, and
leaned on the fence.</P><P>“Wow…I
hope I don't fall down there.” Naminè took a step back, looking
over to Olette. “But you two would come and save me, right?” The
magician looked at her friends.</P><P>At
first, Kairi thought she had misheard.</P><P>“Are
you sure? Wouldn't you like it if Kairi came and rescued you all on
her own? Like a shining prince on a white horse that saves the
princess?” Olette teased her, with a big grin on her face.</P><P>“But
Kairi isn't a prince. And a white horse? Olette, did Tifa give you
something odd to drink?”</P><P>Kairi
and Olette started to laugh. It was sometimes funny that Naminè took
such sayings literally. But who could blame her? She had no memories
of her past, and they still didn't know her true age or birthplace.</P><P>The
atmosphere was good, and the girls enjoyed themselves up there.
Olette preferred to lay supine on a bench with Naminè next to her on
the ground. It had become a fixed habit of patting her head, and
Naminè let no one else but Olette and Kairi do it.</P><P>Time
went by, and they silently enjoyed being together. For Kairi, it was
not quite as enjoyable. She wanted to forget it, to get over it. But
it wouldn't be easy to bring it up. Maybe the direct way really was
the best…</P><P>“We
failed.”</P><P>Olette
and Naminè stopped everything they were doing and looked at Kairi,
confused.</P><P>“We
failed because I was too weak. A town burned down, many people died,
and even you two almost died. And it was all because I'm stubborn and
incompetent.”</P><P>Kairi
blamed herself for her lack of power, her lack of foreseeing the
enemy's moves. Blamed herself for getting injured and almost dying,
blamed herself for what Olette and Naminè had had to go through.</P><P>“Don't
be so damn stupid!”</P><P>Kairi
was pulled out of her world. Olette had stood up and yelled at Kairi,
looking really angry. Kairi had never seen Olette like that. She was
clenching her fists, looking at Kairi.</P><P>“How
am I stupid? Do you honestly believe it wasn't my fault?!” Kairi
yelled back.</P><P>Naminè
hated this. Hated Kairi and Olette yelling at each other. It made her
feel sad and angry inside, and the blond girl could only look on the
ground, unable to face whatever was going on between the others.</P><P>“Yes
I do! How damn self-centered can you be that you believe everything
is your fault?” Olette said everything in a rage. Olette usually
never talked to her like that, but Kairi's attitude made her angry.</P><P>“How
is it not? I screwed up when fighting him, I almost died trying to
let you two escape just to find out that you two were trapped in the
world and almost died fighting him again! It's all my damn fault!”
Kairi was no less angry.</P><P>Olette
knew how Kairi was feeling and why she was blaming herself, but it
was too much to take all the blame herself. Why didn't Kairi trust
them? She wasn't just a sole fighter that had to protect them.</P><P>“Didn't
you say we're a team? In a team, there is no 'my fault.' There is
only 'our fault.' Don't you understand that?” Olette walked to
Kairi, standing right in front of her.</P><P>Kairi
didn't know what to say. True, she had called them a team, and Olette
was right.</P><P>“Let
us shoulder some of that fault, Kairi. It's not yours alone. We could
have stopped you from going. But we were so sure of ourselves. We
thought we could handle it.” Olette slowly calmed down.</P><P>Kairi
sunk to her knees, staring at the ground. It felt good to let it all
out, to yell and to be angry. She rarely allowed herself to feel like
that.</P><P>“You're
not alone. Not now, not in the future. You will always have the
people from Hollow Bastion. Have Tifa and Aerith. And especially us.
We stepped into this world, and we won't ever leave it.” Olette
didn't feel like hugging Kairi, so he went back to Naminè and took a
deep breath.</P><P>“It
felt good to let it out…” Kairi felt much better. Now…now, she
had the courage to finally say it.</P><P>A
few minutes of silence went by. Naminè had calmed down and was
sitting on the same bench as Olette was, and Kairi was standing at
the fence, looking at the sun, which was slowly setting.</P><P>“I…have
something else to say.”</P><P>It
hurt. It already hurt. The thought of how they would react hurt.</P><P>“We
already yelled at each other, I hope you now have some positive
news.” Olette was trying to lighten up the atmosphere.</P><P>“You
have no idea…” Kairi whispered to herself, not loudly enough for
anyone to hear.</P><P>“What
is it? You can always talk to us. We will always be there for you,
Kairi.” Naminé wanted Kairi to believe her.</P><P>“It's
about that. Exactly that. You two and me.”</P><P>It
was like a curtain of anxiety fell over them. Kairi was still
standing at the fence, directly in front of the sun. The setting sun
wrapped her into a dark red light.</P><P>“I
only…<I>like</I> you two.”</P><P>They
didn't dare to say a word. Their hearts were beating like mad, and
their minds were blank, unable to think anything.</P><P>Kairi
felt different. Her heart wasn't beating like mad, it was like
something icy had grabbed it. It was painful to breathe, painful to
speak. But there was no way back now.</P><P>“You
are friends, and that's it. Nothing more than that. Why don't you
understand that?”</P><P>Kairi
couldn't continue. She had to take a deep breath and collect all of
her courage to say it.</P><P>Turning
around, the crimson sunlight shining around her silhouette mostly
masked her. But they could clearly see her face. The words came
slowly, and each of it felt painful.</P><P>“I
don't love either of you. Give up already. Stop forcing your
expectations on me. Just leave me alone!”</P><P>Without
waiting for any response, Kairi turned around and started running.
She didn't want to be near anyone for now. What would they think of
her now? In a mere second, she had turned their relationship upside
down. But it was her decision to do things this way. She had always
been a lone wolf and would always be. Maybe she just wasn't made for
romance.</P><P>Olette
and Naminè were left behind, in many ways. Still sitting on the
bench, the sun had set, and darkness started to devour the light,
started to devour their hearts.</P><P>“I
didn't know it would feel like that,” Naminè whispered.</P><P>Olette
was looking at the moon that was coming up. A single tear ran from
her eyes.</P><P>“Olette…”
Naminè was resting her head on Olette's shoulder.</P><P>“I
know how you feel…we knew it could end up like this. We knew it…but
it still hurts.”</P><P>“I
don't understand. Why did Kairi look so sad?” Naminè was looking
up to Olette.</P><P>“I
don't know…”</P><P>If
they had ever needed each other, then it was now.</P><P>Olette
felt miserable. She had always told herself this could happen, and
she thought she was prepared for it. But in the end, she wasn't. It
hurt, but she didn't cry. For a while, she didn't want to see Kairi's
face, just so that this feeling would go away. It surely would, if
she just had some distance.</P><P>Naminè
took it worse. She had always loved Kairi. Sadness had a tight grip
around her heart. For a few minutes Naminè was about to cry, but
with Olette near her, only tears fell in complete silence.</P><P>They
continued to sit there, and darkness had already covered most of
Hollow Bastion. It got colder, and Naminè moved in closer to Olette,
freezing.</P><P>“Can
we go home?”</P><P>Naminè
was cold and despite everything that happened, she wanted to be at
least in the same house Kairi was.</P><P>“I…don't
want to.”</P><P>Naminè
thought she had misheard. Why would Olette not want to go home? It
was the only place they had left to go to. And even if Kairi had
rejected them, Naminè wanted to be close to her, even if it meant
only knowing she was there.</P><P>“Why
not?”</P><P>“Because
of Kairi.”</P><P>Home
was where Kairi was. For now, Olette didn't want to see her face, or
to be anywhere near her. If that meant not going home, then Olette
wouldn't go. It hurt to just think about her, but seeing her, knowing
she was just a room apart, Olette couldn't stand it.</P><P>Olette
shook her head. It wasn't like that. Not exactly. But she didn't want
to see Kairi's face now or tomorrow. It would only stir up bad
feelings.</P><P>“Do
you dislike Kairi now?”</P><P>“No,
I don't. But…I'm different from you. I don't want to see her right
now. It would only make me feel worse.”</P><P>Naminè
sighed and hugged Olette. She understood her point, even if she
didn't understand that feeling. But if Olette needed to be away to
get better, Naminè wouldn't stop her.</P><P>“Will
you stay with me?” Olette didn't want to be all alone. At least
Naminè should stay with her.</P><P>“I
want to go home. I don't want to be away from Kairi, no matter how
she feels about me.”</P><P>Olette
sort of understood how Naminè felt, but she wasn't able to share
that feeling. Olette just needed a bit time alone to handle this
matter.</P><P>“I
won't go home. Not today, maybe not tomorrow. Please understand that.
Do you still want to go home, alone?” It was Olette's last try to
make Naminè go with her.</P><P>“I
do. I promised myself I would never leave Kairi alone again.”
Naminè could see the disappointment in Olette's face.</P><P>“You're
strong, Naminè…” Olette couldn't do that. Couldn't go there.
Naminè seemed to still love Kairi. It was not surprising. But how
about herself?</P><P>“What
do you mean?”</P><P>“Nothing.
Let's go home.”</P><P>It
was dark and cold when they got down. It was night and thestars and
moon were out, shining over the town. It was a beautiful sight. But
in this moment, Olette couldn't see anything beautiful in it. The
girls were quiet until they reached the door to their home. Naminè
had already her hand on the doorknob when Olette turned around.</P><P>“Where
are you staying? I want to be near Kairi, but I don't want to be away
from you.”</P><P>“I'm
going to crash at Yuffie's place. You can come and see me anytime.
Good night, Naminè.”</P><P>Before
Naminè could reply, Olette hugged her tightly and whispered a few
words, feeling worse than before. If only Naminè had gone with her.</P><p

Hearts----</P><P>The
way down had been long, and Kairi still felt miserable. Their faces,
when she told them…that image…would she ever get it out of her
head?</P><P>“Why
am I so stupid…how is this the right thing? How is this better? Why
did I have to tell them, why didn't I just wait a couple months?!
Just why can't I do a single thing right?!”</P><P>Sad
about what happened, angry at herself, Kairi only wanted to get home,
wanted to get in her bed, and wanted the day to end. Why didn't she
just let it be? That sure was a great way to start working things out
between them right after they had gotten back from their disastrous
mission.</P><P>There
was no one home. Tifa and Aerith were out. Kairi stood in the living
room for a bit. The sun was almost down and only a few last fragments
of light were finding their way into the house.</P><P>“I'm
so stupid…”</P><P>Kairi
had enough of it. She only wanted to be alone. She slowly walked up
the stairs to her room. She stopped for a second at the room Olette
and Naminè were sharing. Would they come back? They surely wouldn't
want to be anywhere near her right now. And they were right. With a
big sigh, Kairi walked away from the door.</P><P>Going
into her own room, not even bothering to undress, Kairi went to bed.</P><P>“I
wish things went as easily as in books…reality is much too harsh…”</P><P>Slowly
fading over to the realm of dreams, Kairi was once again confronted
with her inner demons. The faces of Olette and Naminè when she told
them the truth, the fear of failing to meet the expectations everyone
placed on her…</P><P>Time
passed by, and Kairi was deeply asleep when her door was opened, and
a pair of curious eyes looked inside the dark room, only to vanish a
second later, closing the door.</P><P>“She's
asleep.”</P><P>Aerith
was standing in front of the door, Tifa next to her, carrying Naminè.
They had found her on the couch, sleeping with a sad expression still
on her face. Next to her was Olette's note. They knew it was useless
to go over to Yuffie's. She would only tell them to get lost at this
time of night.</P><P>“What
in the hell happened between them? Kairi is sleeping, Naminè on the
couch making such a face and to top it off, Cid told me he saw Olette
going into Yuffie's apartment. Talk about a crazy day.” Tifa was
rolling her eyes in annoyance. What the hell had happened in a few
hours?</P><P>“I
don't know. And I think we shouldn't rush to conclusions. Let's
carefully ask Kairi tomorrow.”</P><P>“I'm
getting her into bed.”</P><P>Aerith
was left standing in front of Kairi's door. If all three of them were
like this, she could already guess what happened. It would only make
things worse to drill for an answer. If the girls wanted them to
know, they would tell them.</P><P>A
few minutes later, Tifa fell onto her own bed. Training with Olette
was one thing, but training with Aerith was extremely tiring. The
pink-clad woman sat on her side of the bed, leaning over, playing
with her lover's long hair.</P><P>“You
need to learn to take it easy on me. You almost blasted me up that
one time.” Tifa was complaining, but not being serious.</P><P>Aerith
smiled and started making a pattern in Tifa's hair. She loved to play
with Tifa's hair. That way she didn't have to fix it afterwards.</P><P>“If
I weren't serious, you'd win too easily, Lofa.” Aerith was giggling
for no reason.</P><P>“Lofa?
What's that mean?” Tifa looked up, confused.</P><P>“Your
new nickname.” A wide, big smile was on her face.</P><P>“But
what does it mean?” Tifa wanted to get up, but Aerith was still
twiddling with Tifa's hair.</P><P>“Now
you're being lazy, Tifa Lockhart.”</P><P>It
took a few seconds until Tifa realized. She rolled her eyes and
smiled.</P><P>“Very
creative, really.” Tifa sighed and closed her eyes.</P><P>“Hey,
if it were too complex, you'd never get it.” Aerith was making an
evil smile.</P><P>“You're
so mean, Raina.”</P><P>“Now
you're just taking random letters from my name and making up a
nickname,” Aerith complained.</P><P>“So?
You did the same.”</P><P>“At
least think of something better.” Aerith was still playing with
Tifa's hair.</P><P>“What
are you doing the whole time with my hair anyway?” Tifa grew
gradually suspicious of her lover.</P><P>“Nothing,
really.” Aerith couldn't suppress the giggling anymore and fell
down on the bed.</P><P>“I
swear, if you did something to my hair again, I will—oh,
goddamn it!” Tifa stood up and looked in the mirror.</P><P>Tifa's
hair was made into two braids, similar to Aerith's, but shorter. It
made her look really ridiculous and even though Tifa tried to undo
the stylistic massacre, she couldn't manage it.</P><P>“Dear
God, Aerith, each and every time you do this!”</P><P>Aerith
was lying on the bed, looking at Tifa, giggling and virtually lusting
over her lover with her eyes.</P><P>“I
swear, deep down, you're a pervert.” Tifa pointed at Aerith,
slightly angry.</P><P>“And
you still love me.” Aerith made a overly cute expression and almost
got Tifa laughing.</P><P>“But
you're <I>still</I> a pervert!”</P><P>“That's
only because you're so good-looking.”</P><P>“Talk
about yourself.” Tifa, with her hilarious hairstyle, went back to
the bed, kneeling next to Aerith, looking straight in her eyes.</P><P>“Do
you want another workout?” Tifa used a seducing voice, getting
closer to Aerith. They could feel each other's breath on their faces.</P><P>Instead
of a answer, Aerith closed the distance, kissing the black-haired
woman, laying a hand around her neck. Tifa's lips were rough from the
training, but they never lost their delicious taste. Aerith got
pushed down on the bed by Tifa, and with that, their kiss broke up.</P><P>“Shower.
Now,” Aerith said and got up, away from the bed.</P><P>Tifa
had a disappointed look on her face, and let herself fall on the bed.
The last days had been so troublesome, it had been some time since
she last slept with Aerith. And now she just had to go and take a
shower.</P><P>“Are
you deaf nowadays, Tifa?” Aerith was standing next to the bed,
looking from above into her face.</P><P>“What?
But I thought—” The
black-clad woman was confused.</P><P>“When
I said shower, I meant<I> both of us</I>.” Aerith took Tifa's hand
and pulled her up. Giggling and smiling, they made their way over to
the bathroom.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“Ya
got any idea what time it is…?”</P><P>Olette
couldn't find a bell, so she had knocked. For about five minutes.</P><P>“Yuffie,
I need you to do…me…a favor…and…” With each word, Olette
blushed harder.</P><P>Yuffie
opened the door, but what made Olette blush was her attire. The only
thing—the one and only
thing Yuffie was wearing—was
a very long shirt. It barely covered her hips, but Yuffie didn't seem
to mind.</P><P>“Whatcha
doing here this time…?”</P><P>“Can
I crash at your place for a few nights?”</P><P>“Sure,
but why aren't you…oh, I see, you've had a fight with Kairi or
Naminè, right?”</P><P>“Sort…of,
I guess.”</P><P>Alone
from Olette's expression, Yuffie knew that it was no topic she would
make any more jokes about.</P><P>“Come
in, it's late. I was already sleepin'.”</P><P>Yuffie
made way and Olette stepped into the most likely worst-organized
apartment in history. There was everything everywhere. No sign of
order far and wide. It was a amazing view in its own chaotic way.
There was no free place anywhere. Even the bed was full of stuff,
mostly little colored marbles.</P><P>“You're
gonna sleep in the bed.”</P><P>Olette
wasn't one to argue. If Yuffie let her sleep in the bed, that was
good. Who was she to deny that hospitality?</P><P>“One
more thing, you're not gonna sleep with yer clothes. Strip.”</P><P>For
some reason, when Yuffie said it, it sounded so incredibly wrong that
Olette shivered for a second.</P><P>“Want
something to drink? I believe I have some Malacia here…”</P><P>Yuffie
started searching through the kitchen part while Olette was more or
less embarrassed to undress. There was no place to put the clothes,
so Olette just put them atop of Yuffie's. Any more chaos couldn't
make this any worse-looking than it was.</P><P>“No,
I'm fine…I just want to sleep…”</P><P>“Okay.
I'll dim the lights. I find my way around in darkness just fine.”</P><P>“Good
night, Yuffie. And thanks for letting me in.”</P><P>“Don't
worry about it.”</P><P>Olette
closed her eyes. The bed was amazingly clean and the room too—didn't
reek at all. Most of the chaos seemed to come from tools and
materials Yuffie used for her weapons.</P><P>But
the continuous sounds from the other room held her awake for a bit
longer. She was cold and the bed wasn't all that warm. Where did
Yuffie sleep if the bed was this cold?</P><P>A
few minutes later, Olette was half-asleep when the noises came
suddenly closer, much closer. Just what could Yuffie be doing in a
dark room?</P><P>A
second later, Olette knew that Yuffie had been making her way over to
the bed, making a huge ruckus. Something came into the bed, and
Olette could feel warm breath on her neck. To top it off, two tender
arms were searching their way around her waist, pulling her closer.
Olette didn't feel like freaking out, like pushing her off. It was
weird, but she actually enjoyed it that someone was apparently caring
for her. Her heart was longing for some comfort, and Yuffie didn't
seem like a bad person to get it from.</P><P>“I
thought you said I can sleep in the bed?”</P><P>“You
can, can't you?”</P><P>“But—”</P><P>“I
never said I was going to sleep somewhere else.”</P><P>“…thank
you.”</P><P>“I
just thought you could use someone near you.”</P><P>Olette
was grateful. Clinging to Yuffie, Olette finally drifted to the land
of dreams.</P><P>But
for the black-haired girl, sleep was still far off. She didn't want
to admit it, but she had observed Olette from the corner of her eyes.
Under normal circumstances, she would have teased her, maybe tried to
get a kiss, but looking at her face made it clear that that would
only make her feel worse.</P><P>For
Yuffie, it didn't matter if it was a guy or a girl. If she was
interested in a person, it didn't matter a bit. Lately, with Olette
and Naminè around, her interests kind of shifted a bit. She still
had an eye on Leon, but chances were she would never be able to
actually get along with him, much less have him like her.</P><P>She
wanted to find out what happened to Olette that made her like that.
But it had to wait till tomorrow. For now, it felt good to not be
alone. Yuffie would never admit it to anyone, but she was often
lonely and got lonely really easily.</P><P>Maybe,
just maybe…</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Awkward.
The whole situation was awkward. Kairi ate breakfast before Naminè
got up and left early. She didn't want to see the girls. Aerith woke
up to the sound of the house door closing. She was still laying in
Tifa's arms. It was probably just Kairi who left early. That meant
she didn't want to talk about it.</P><P>Kairi
spent the morning at the coffee bar. It was run by a woman named
Rydia, a nice young woman with long green hair. Kairi didn't know
which world she was from, but she was one of the many people who
built Hollow Bastion with Ansem the Wise. At least, that was what
Aerith had told her.</P><P>“What
a rare sight we have here. What gets you here so early, Kairi?”
Rydia was still cleaning the coffee bar, as it had just opened.</P><P>“Don't
ask, please.” Kairi just sat there and looked out the window.</P><P>The
weather was just like her mood. Cloudy and about to rain, darker than
was usual for the season. Kairi was still feeling sick and miserable
from the previous day. How long would it take until she could face
the girls?</P><P>“I
won't ask, then.” The woman smiled and continued to polish the
counter.</P><P>“Thanks.”
Kairi just wanted the time to pass.</P><P>Staring
out the window, it soon started to rain. Barely anyone came to the
coffee bar when the weather was like this, and Rydia gave Kairi a big
coffee as a courtesy of the house.</P><P>Kairi
could feel every tick of the clock. Every second that went on
stretched to feel like hours. Should she skip training? In this rain,
and with her troubled mind and heart, how could she put up with Leon?
It would be a waste of time.</P><P>How
should she explain it? “Sorry, I feel bad about breaking the hearts
of two girls, I can't train today”? That sure sounded cheesy and
like a poor excuse. But why did she feel so bad about doing it to
them?</P><P>Did
she like them after all? But why didn't she feel anything for them
aside from friendship? Kairi could only guess. Her own emotions had
always been a mystery for her.</P><P>Kairi
was regretting doing what she had done. It had been a stupid idea. It
would've been better to just say she didn't feel anything for them

<I>yet</I>.</P><P>One
thing that made Kairi worry more than anything was what would happen
if she did come to like one of them, or even both, eventually.
Wouldn't they think she was just cruel? It was the thing that scared
Kairi the most. Falling in love with them.</P><P>In
Kairi's mind, she noticed one thing. The thought of liking them, the
thought of falling in love with a girl, didn't seem gross or weird to
her. Was it influence from living with Aerith and Tifa? Or had just
something changed inside her in the last few days? Whatever it was,
Kairi had changed.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>In
other places, things were different. Much different.</P><P>“Sorry,
Aerith, I…don't really have any appetite.”</P><P>Naminè
didn't feel like eating anything. She didn't even feel like getting
up that morning. After remembering that Olette was at Yuffie's place,
Naminè felt all alone.</P><P>Aerith
wanted to comfort her, and it meant much to Naminè. Kairi had
rejected her, and it still hurt. It didn't hurt as much as it had the
night before, but Naminè wasn't particular happy that Kairi had left
before she got up.</P><P>Tifa
was still sleeping, and Aerith was alone with Naminè in the living
room. Aerith knew how much a broken heart—unrequited
love—could hurt. She had
experienced it in the past and truly never wanted to feel like that
again. Or, for that matter, didn't want anyone else to feel like
that.</P><P>“I
can imagine, I think, how you feel…” Aerith sat down next to
Naminè, laying a hand on hers.</P><P>“I
feel horrible…I never felt bad like this before. Why…why did
Kairi reject me? Reject us?”</P><P>“Kairi
rejected you? Naminè, will you tell me what happened?”</P><P>“We
went…to our place. We just enjoyed being there…we really got
along the last few days. I was really happy about it. Kairi started
talking about the…mission all of a sudden. Olette and Kairi got
really angry and yelled at each other. I felt really sick when they
did that. Olette then said we were a team and that there is no 'your
fault' and only 'our fault'…I thought Kairi knew it, but apparently
she didn't. They made up and said it felt good to let it out…then…”
Naminè made a break. It felt good to talk to someone about it.</P><P>“Kairi
always tries to shoulder all the blame alone. Even when she went with
one of us, and we screwed up by being outsiders in that world, Kairi
would blame herself. Kairi said us she had something to tell us…and
then…” Naminè didn't want to repeat it. It hurt a bit by talking
about it, by admitting it, by accepting it. “… she told us she
doesn't love us.”</P><P>Aerith
could only sigh and embrace Naminè, who looked like she would start
crying any second, and rub her back. There wasn't anything she could
say or do about this. Naminè had gotten her heart broken by the girl
she had loved since the moment she had gotten here, and it seemed to
be her first love too.</P><P>It
reminded Aerith of the time Tifa was still chasing Cloud. She had
secretly been in love with her for a long time, from before their
world got destroyed. There had been a time she had thought about
giving up, about just admitting that Tifa wasn't interested. It took
over a year for the two women to get together.</P><P>Naminè
was happy being comforted by Aerith. It felt good, it made the pain
hurt less, knowing that someone else cared for her.</P><P>“Olette
is gone too.. she said she doesn't want to see Kairi. Will her pain
go away?”</P><P>“The
pain will lessen…but it will never go completely away. And if she
still loves her…she won't be able to forget the pain completely.
Not as long as she loves her.” Aerith knew that lying about such
things only made it worse.</P><P>“What
should I do, then? I don't want Olette to feel like that whenever she
looks at Kairi. I still love her and want to be near her, but Olette
wants to be apart from her. I don't want them to be separated like
that.”</P><P>For
the moment, Aerith was just a friend she could talk with who
comforted her, not the parent of the girl she was in love with.</P><P>“You
can only hope. People's feelings are very delicate and easily hurt.
If Olette still loves Kairi, she will come back. If she doesn't, it
will take her a bit of time to get over it. They won't be the same as
before, but they can be still friends.”</P><P>Aerith
made a break. Naminè really must be close to Olette to worry about
how she was feeling even now. But what about her own feelings? She
wanted to be near Kairi, but what about her feelings for her?</P><P>“Naminè,
do you still love Kairi?”</P><P>Naminè
took a while to answer. It was only a slight nod, her feelings were
confused, but she would never completely stop loving Kairi. She still
wanted to be near her at all times, wanted to see her.</P><P>“If
you still love her, keep trying. Kairi has been slow with romantic
things since I first knew her. It might take a while, but maybe she
will requite your feelings one day. But there is no guarantee how
long it will take. It could take years, or never happen. If you give
up on her, you can still be near her, but as friend. Waiting for all
eternity is a sad thing, and I don't want you to go through that.”</P><P>Naminè
didn't say anything. There wasn't a good choice. Only one less bad
than the other. For her to forget about Kairi, to give up…she could
never do it. She would continue trying. Even if it hurt, there was
something inside her that would never allow her to forget Kairi.</P><P>Naminè
had found her resolve. It was the only thing she could do for now.</P><P>“We'll
skip training today. Get some rest, please. I'm not going to let you
skip lunch and dinner.”</P><P>Naminè
nodded, finally let go of Aerith, and stood up. “Thanks. For
everything.”</P><P>Naminè
took a deep breath. It was still early, but she wanted to see her.
See Olette. She said she was at Yuffie's place, and Naminè roughly
remembered where that was. She would tell Olette what her decision
was.</P><P>“I'm
going out for a bit.”</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>It
was suffocating. Hard to breathe, as if something heavy was on top of
her chest. Opening one eye, Olette saw a chaotic and messy room.
Right…she was at Yuffie's place. Looking down on her, she noticed
what was lying on her chest. Yuffie. To be accurate, it was Yuffie's
head, and her face was buried in Olette's breasts.</P><P>Immediately
blushing, the brunette tried to free herself, but every attempt only
made Yuffie move along, cling to her. She was strong, but by no means
as strong as Olette, and after a bit of effort, she finally got free.
But what now? Get up? Olette had momentarily forgotten about Kairi,
but once she was free and her face wasn't glaring red anymore, it all
came back. Now, looking at Yuffie, who was innocently sleeping in her
bed, didn't seem so bad a option to go back to.</P><P>Olette
remembered the last night. Yuffie had come to her, embraced her,
comforted her, cared for her. The other people that could have
comforted her were all living in the same house as Kairi. And of all
places to be, that was the one she didn't want to go to.</P><P>Olette's
heart longed for comfort, longed for company. And Yuffie was there.</P><P>Making
her way over to the kitchen part, it took Olette a few minutes to
find out where the coffee machine was, and another couple minutes
where the coffee was. It had gotten colder, it was still early, and
from the sound of it, even raining.</P><P>She
looked for her clothes, but couldn't find anything. The place she had
put them the day before had vanished or was buried under a pile of
chaos. There was little choice but to walk around in just a shirt and
underpants.</P><P>The
coffee was almost done, and Olette freezing, when Yuffie showed up,
half-asleep but finding her way amazingly well through the chaos
without stumbling or falling.</P><P>“You
already up?”</P><P>“I…well,
it was kind of hard to breathe with you on top of me.” Olette
wanted to be honest.</P><P>“Oh,
I didn't do that…really? Aw, I'm sorry, Olette.” Seeing Yuffie
embarrassed was a fun sight and Olette couldn't suppress to giggle at
it. It was the first sign of not being miserable since the last
night.</P><P>“It
was…a bit unpleasant.” Olette was still a bit embarrassed..</P><P>“Do
I look that bad?” Yuffie showed a smile, turned around and made a
really sad face.</P><P>Yuffie
had always been kind of alone. Having had an unrequited crush on Leon
for the longest of times, and given her personality, Yuffie spent a
lot of time alone in her apartment, working on weapons, tools, and
just being alone. She often wanted to have just someone there to
comfort her, someone there to be with her.</P><P>“No,
it's just…I'm kind of wary with that stuff because of yesterday…”
Olette said.</P><P>Yuffie
walked over and moved behind Olette, suddenly laying both arms around
her waist, leaning against her from behind. It was a huge gamble, but
if Olette really had a fight with Kairi, she wouldn't turn down a bit
of comfort.</P><P>“Thank
you.” It felt so good to have someone care about her like that.
Olette closed her eyes. Yuffie was impulsive, intrusive, and all the
time a tease It seemed stupid to jump onto someone else like that,
but Olette didn't mind what Yuffie was doing in the slightest.</P><P>“What
do you think about me, Yuffie?”</P><P>An
awkward silence fell over them. It took Yuffie a moment to decide.
Would she go with the truth, or would she tell what Olette wanted to
hear?</P><P>“You're
cute, strong, and from what I hear, dependable. Also, you're fun to
tease.”</P><P>“Kairi
rejected Naminè and me. That's why I'm here. I just thought you
should know that.”</P><P>Yuffie
wasn't particularly happy to hear that. It always hurt to have
unrequited feelings. And if Olette didn't want to see Kairi, Yuffie
would let her stay.</P><P>“Stay
as long as you want. I'll not charge you anything. It's been a while
since I've slept so well.”</P><P>There
was an awkward moment between the two girls and none of them dared to
look at each other's face. They went back to reality when the coffee
machine made a beeping sound.</P><P>Olette
poured the coffee in two cups, giving one to Yuffie.</P><P>“Can
you tell me where my clothes are?”</P><P>“I'll
trade a cup of coffee for that info.”</P><P>Olette
gave a cup of coffee to Yuffie, who immediately sipped at it and
showed a thumbs up. “End of the bed.”</P><P>Olette
placed her cup on a tiny free place, going back to the bed. Looking
for her clothes, Olette crawled over the bed. It was so cold, Yuffie
must have no heater, or had at least turned it off.</P><P>Yuffie
let her cup stand next to Olette's and crawled next to Olette, who
had just picked up her clothes.</P><P>“Let
the clothes be, it's still early. I'm going back into bed. Won't you
join me? I promise to be all gentle 'n stuff,” Yuffie said, and
crawled back to her pillow.</P><P>Olette
spent a split second thinking about what Yuffie said, then dismissed
it as teasing. Spending time with her didn't seem so bad. It was
better than anything else she could think of in the moment. She
didn't have anything to do. Putting back her clothes—at
least she knew now where they were—Olette
got back in the bed. Looking directly at Yuffie was too embarrassing,
so she turned around and lay on her side with her back directed to
Yuffie.</P><P>They
were interrupted right away. Someone was knocking on the door.</P><P>“You
go. No way someone is coming for me this early. I usually sleep till
ten.”</P><P>Olette
sighed and got up, finding her way through the chaos. At some point,
she would force Yuffie to clean at least a path from the bed to the
door and to the kitchen.</P><P>Opening
the door, Olette saw an unexpected guest. A warm feeling came up
inside her. It was nice to see the blond girl, even if it was
virtually freezing outside.</P><P>“Naminè!”</P><P>“I
wanted to see if you're okay, Olette.”</P><P>“I'm
okay. Yuffie let me in and even though it's a hell of chaos in here,
it's okay.”</P><P>“That's
all on purpose!” Yuffie shouted from the other room.</P><P>“Naminè,
are you…okay? You seem different from last night.”</P><P>“I
talked about it with Aerith. Olette…I…won't give up on Kairi. I
just can't.”</P><P>It
was not all that surprising for Olette. Naminè had been in love with
Kairi since forever. But that she would come and tell her like
this…the girl wasn't as weak as Olette had thought.</P><P>“What
will you do?” Naminè was asking, looking at Olette.</P><P>“I
don't know. I just don't want to see her right now. Will you come
in?”</P><P>Naminè
shook her head. She wanted to talk to Kairi. Maybe she was already
back home.</P><P>“I'm
happy you came to see me. I already started to miss you.”</P><P>Naminè
giggled and took Olette's hand. “What kind of friend wouldn't come
by to see how her best friend is doing? And…I miss you too. It's
hard to be apart from you.”</P><P>Olette
was a bit moved, and when Naminé let go and ran down the stairs, she
took a deep breath. If Naminè could show such strength, then it was
time she stopped pitying herself.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>The
day went by uneventfully. All three girls ditched training that day
and went separate ways. Kairi spent her whole day staring at the
rain, letting feelings of regret and rage about her own stupidity
overwhelm her.</P><P>Naminè
kept looking for Kairi, but the redhead never showed up for lunch or
dinner. Naminè had no appetite and didn't eat much. Aerith had told
Tifa that it was better not to ask. Even though she had promised not
to tell anyone, she told Tifa a few important things about what
happened. Tifa was often impulsive, but not dumb. She knew better
than to mention any of it to Naminè. Olette never showed up for
training, but she had expected as much.</P><P>Olette's
day was much different from the others'. Olette spent most of her
time watching Yuffie working on her tools and talking to her. Yuffie
was back to teasing Olette, like she usually did, and constantly
making more chaos.</P><P>The
day went by uneventfully, and the night came. Kairi returned home
long after night had fallen. Rydia had closed that evening and Kairi
aimlessly wandered about the town. She waited until all of the lights
were gone in her home. How could she face Naminè and Olette in the
future? Avoiding them forever was impossible. The next mission would
come, and it would inevitably lead to meetings, to working with them.</P><P>Was
she…running away from this? Running away from facing her inner
demons? Maybe she was. It was her own fault that all of this had
happened. Maybe she should have just told them it wasn't their fault,
that she just wasn't able to feel romantic about them. The day had
been long, and Kairi had thought about a lot of things.</P><P>What
if it only took time for her? Kairi had come to like them in just a
few weeks, but what would things look like in a month? In a year?
What if she fell in love with one, or worse, both of them? She had
thought about it before, but if she kept running away from this, all
her chances to resolve this mess would vanish into thin air.</P><P>It
was time to stop running away. To face reality. The next day, Kairi
would talk to them.</P><P>Naminè
had lain awake for a long time. Aerith and Tifa had gone to bed, and
Naminè looked outside the window, lying in Olette's bed. Her smell
sort of calmed her down.</P><P>Naminè
had chosen to keep pursuing Kairi no matter what happened. Alone, the
thought of giving up on Kairi, the girl who rescued her, who made her
life worthwhile, was making her feel sick.</P><P>But
there was something else. Naminè could feel <I>something</I>

connecting her to Kairi. Something that went beyond simple love,
beyond anything she had an explanation for. It was hard to describe,
to put into words. Naminè could feel Kairi, could feel what she
felt. Naminè remembered feeling it once, in the castle when she was
held prisoner. Since then, it had gone. But now, since Kairi had
rejected her, it was back. Not only did Naminè have to deal with her
own feelings, she had to deal with Kairi's too.</P><P>But
it was also something that enforced her decision to try harder with
Kairi. If there was something like that connecting them, it was just
wrong to ignore it. Naminè tried to explore it, tried to dig deeper
into Kairi's feelings. Only this time, she actually felt something
else than sadness.</P><P>Regret.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Olette
spent her whole day with Yuffie, and they had done nothing but
assemble weird things and laugh, and Yuffie teased Olette while they
had fun. They were tired and in bed, still talking. The conversation
took a grave turn around when Yuffie brought up a sensitive subject.</P><P>“Did
you cry about her?”</P><P>Olette
didn't. On the observation deck with Naminè, she shed a few single
tears, but it wasn't crying. Afterwards, she had confined her sadness
inside herself, but being with Yuffie helped a great deal with 
that.</P><P>“No.”</P><P>Olette
didn't like thinking about it. It didn't hurt anywhere near as much
as the day before, but it still felt bad. How long would it take to
completely forget that pain?</P><P>“Maybe
you should. Letting it all out could help.”</P><P>Crying
never helped. That was Olette's opinion on it. But what if Yuffie was
right? Just crying once, when nobody but Yuffie saw it, wouldn't mean
the end of the world.</P><P>“If
I ever feel like crying again, I'll come to you,” Olette said.</P><P>She
just didn't feel like crying anymore. For now, she was feeling a bit
better.</P><P>“Olette…”</P><P>Yuffie's
voice was so serious that Olette turned around, wondering what Yuffie
had to say.</P><P>Before
she could react to anything, Yuffie's face was only a breath's
distance away from hers, two tender arms were pulling her closer.
Olette felt two small soft lips meeting her own, and closed her eyes
in reflex. Yuffie was kissing her with passion, and Olette was either
too surprised to push her away, or just didn't want to.</P><P>Seconds
later, Yuffie broke away, and looked in the eyes of the brunette.
There was no anger, just bafflement. Yuffie had a thing for Olette's
tomboyish nature, and she was quite attractive too—so
cute that the urge to kiss her had just suddenly come up.</P><P>Olette
was speechless. Her first real kiss, not counting the one with
Naminè, stolen by Yuffie. It felt good, but she had no experience.
Olette suddenly got embarrassed about how amateurish she must have
acted.</P><P>“Was
that your first kiss?” Yuffie was a bit surprised at how stunned
Olette was.</P><P>“Y-yeah…”</P><P>“Well,
mine too. I'd say that makes us even, no?” That was just the kind
of logic Yuffie had.</P><P>Olette
wanted to say something, but she still could feel Yuffie's lips on
hers, and she could feel the redness in her face. That was just
something she expected from Yuffie. But…for some reason, Olette
couldn't be really angry.</P><P>“I'm
going to sleep.” The brunette turned around and closed her eyes.</P><P>A
few seconds went by without anything happening. Yuffie had a true
devil's smile, and as soon as her hands moved around Olette's body,
the brunette went up, startled and surprised. Just how far was Yuffie
going to go? She had just groped her!</P><P>“Damn
it. Aerith was right, you have bigger boobs than I do. That's so
unfair.”</P><P>Olette
was too shocked to be speechless. Yuffie was really a tease, one of
the worst kind.</P><P>“No
groping!” Olette said, and looked straight at Yuffie, who averted
her gaze and waved with her hands. It had happened on an impulse when
Yuffie remembered Aerith's comment.</P><P>“Okay,
okay.”</P><P>Yuffie
instead closed in and tried to kiss Olette again but failed. The
Keyblader was too fast and put a hand on Yuffie's mouth.</P><P>“No
sudden kissing!”</P><P>“Prude.”
Yuffie made a sulking face, turned around and lay down.</P><P>Olette
had been teased enough for that night. She lay down with her back to
Yuffie, and closed her eyes. Not even a minute later, she could feel
Yuffie moving closer, laying her arms around her.</P><P>“I'm
not groping you.” Yuffie's tone had suddenly changed, went from her
usual playful one to a serious one.</P><P>She
really wasn't. Yuffie only laid her arms around her waist, hugging
her like before.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Kairi
couldn't sleep. If telling them she didn't love them was hard,
telling them now that it was a mistake and that she wanted her
friends back was even harder.</P><P>But
Kairi had made her decision. If they were willing to forgive her, she
was willing to…wait. Wait and tell them if she really felt
something.</P><P>Kairi
found Naminè at breakfast and Naminè went up the instant she saw
Kairi. She stood right in front of her, looking straight at 
Kairi.</P><P>“Kairi…listen.”</P><P>The
redhead hadn't anticipated that, but nodded. Whatever Naminè had to
say, whatever she would do, no matter how much she cursed her, hit
her, slapped her, Kairi would take it. It had been her error, her
wrong decision, and she had to take the consequences. She had to stop
running away.</P><P>Naminè
turned around, took a deep breath, and turning around once again. It
took a lot of courage to even open her mouth. After a few failed
attempts to get out any coordinated words, Naminè took another deep
breath.</P><P>“I'll
be blunt. I'm not going to let you go. I'll keep trying. If you don't
like me, I'll make you.”</P><P>Kairi
was speechless. Not only did Naminè say that, she even did it while
looking straight in her eyes.</P><P>“You
really mean that? I mean…Naminè. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
rejected both of you like that. I can't guarantee that I'll <I>never</I>

feel anything for you, so I shouldn't say I can't be with you.”</P><P>Kairi
found it hard to continue. But she had decided to stop running away
from hard decisions. Looking on the ground for a second, Kairi took a
breath and finished her speech.</P><P>“I
have…to tell Olette that too. I'm sorry for rejecting you. I regret
it. I know this might awkward, but I feel that if I don't do this…we
will walk apart.”</P><P>Naminè
looked at Kairi with big eyes. She hadn't expected Kairi to come up
and say something like that. It made her feel happy that Kairi was
feeling like that about her, about Olette. Kairi still wanted to be
friends with them, and that was something very important to Naminè.</P><P>“Where
is Olette?”</P><P>“She's
at Yuffie's place. She didn't want to be near you for a while. I'll
go with you if you go to see her.”</P><P>“I'll
go now. I want this to be over. No more running away.”</P><P>Kairi
didn't lose a second and walked out the door, followed by Naminè,
who had a slab of bread in her mouth, eating away as she followed
Kairi.</P><P>“I
hope she won't hit me. Olette is freaking strong,” Kairi said, and
Naminè giggled.</P><P>“I
won't stand for it. I know Olette, and she won't be pleased with what
you have to say.”</P><P>“I
still hope I'll be in one piece after it.”</P><P>Kairi
felt nauseous. Naminè was one thing, the girl had always loved her,
but Olette was different. Kairi hoped she could fix it, could fix
their relationship.</P><P>Knocking
on Yuffie's door, after a few minutes, Olette opened up, dressed in
some of Yuffie's work clothes, and splotched with oil all over.</P><P>Seeing
Kairi wasn't pleasant at all. She even wanted to close the door as
fast as possible, but seeing that Naminè was with her, something
inside wanted her to listen.</P><P>“Olette,
please listen to me. I'm sorry. I feel stupid for rejecting you two,
and I regret doing it. I can't guarantee what I'll feel in the
future. If you want to hit me, do it. I know it's a awkward thing to
say, but I don't want to lose you as friend. Not now, not ever.”</P><P>Olette
listened, and once Kairi finished, Yuffie showed up, same attire and
splotched all over the place with oil.</P><P>“I'm
not going to hit you, Kairi. I'm not mad, not anymore. But I didn't
expect you to say sorry.”</P><P>Olette
looked at Naminè and then at the ground. It hurt to look at her
directly.</P><P>“But
that isn't how it works, Kairi…what you said hurt, and saying
you're sorry isn't going to change that. Seeing and talking to you
hurts.”</P><P>Olette
looked sad for a moment, then turned around, taking a deep breath and
making a big sigh.</P><P>“Just
leave me alone for now.”</P><P>With
that, Olette vanished into Yuffie's apartment, and the black-haired
girl took her place.</P><P>“That's
how it is. Nothing personal, Kairi, but I doubt she'll want you to
come in. See ya later.”</P><P>With
that, Yuffie closed the door. Naminè didn't dare to look at Kairi.
With slouched shoulders, Kairi went down the stairs.</P><P>How
would she get her friend back?</P>
