<a href="../kinghart/valiant2-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><p align='center'>What
I can do</P><P>“You're
not bad, and although I can't comment on your sword technique, I can
see that you have great potential. But you still lack power. And
accuracy. And speed. And-” Tifa was cut off.</P><P>“Yeah,
I know it already, I know it. You've been telling me this for four
days now,” Olette murmured and sat down on the ground.</P><P>Tifa
had sent her through hell and worse, and she could barely move every
evening. If Kairi had somehow endured this, she really was something
else. On top of that, there was no significant improvement. Tifa kept
her telling that results don't come over night, but this was
definitely overdoing things. How strong could those Heartless things
and the Organization possibly be?</P><P>Tifa's
training consisted of four different lessons. First off, power
training, second was stamina, third speed and reflexes, and last was
a sparing against Tifa herself. Although she was not new to hard
training, this was quite over the edge. The power training was just
plain stupid. Olette had to undergo several hundred practice
movements with her Keyblades, and they got really heavy after just a
few moves. That alone brought her almost to her limits. The stamina
training was even worse. But it was the only thing she improved
almost daily, and that was the only thing that kept her going. Olette
had to make an almost unlimited number of practice movements until
Tifa was satisfied. The speed training on the other hand was not
quite as hard. She was already quite fast, but not even close to
Tifa's level. That particular training consisted of two different
parts. One was just plain movement speed. She had to keep up to her
best with Tifa while they ran a training course that went almost
across the whole of Hollow Bastion. But even Tifa had her limits. The
second part was defensive. Olette had to block super-speed hits from
Tifa. It was crazy how fast that woman could move. She didn't hit her
hard, but it was hard to sense from which direction she would strike
next.</P><P>“We
will skip the sparring part today. You improved quite a bit in just
three days. You're faster, and I guess in a few more days, we will
see the first results in power. You can feel the increase in Stamina
yourself. You will make a great fighter one day. I think I need to
start training again if I don't want to be surpassed by you,” Tifa
laughed and stretched out a hand to Olette.</P><P>“You're
just flattering me, aren't you?“ Olette murmured and took her hand
regardless.</P><P>Even
though the training was really hard, and most of her muscles were
burning, it felt good to get praised like that. Tifa was not the best
mentor, and she knew absolutely nothing about sword techniques. But
when Olette had asked Kairi about that, she said that technique was
something one had to figure out for themselves. Nevertheless, Olette
really started to get along with Tifa.</P><P>“I'm
going to check on Aerith,” Tifa said and left immediately.</P><P>Olette
remembered a accident two days ago, when Naminè tried to cast a
Firega and accidentally almost turned Tifa into roast beef.</P><P>“Don't
get yourself burned,” she called out and walked over to a bench.
De-materializing and summoning the Keyblades was not much work
anymore. Once she figured out how it worked, it was more of a
routine. Kairi was able to summon them on the blink of a eye, but she
still needed to concentrate a moment.</P><P>Olette
looked in the sky and wondered what she was doing. They still hadn't
found a way to get her back to Twilight Town. The portal near the maw
led into nothingness. The portal to her world had vanished without a
trace. And the path was loaded with those black creatures. She had
first refused to participate in this ridiculous exhausting training,
but she had nothing else to do. When she would get back to Twilight
Town, she would be stronger than anyone else there. Winning the
struggle tournament she had left in the middle of it would be easy.</P><P>“Hayner...
Pence...”</P><p align='center'>--Valiant
Hearts--</P><P>Naminè
didn't have a easier time than Olette. While Olette was everyday
complaining about how her whole body was aching, Naminè was mentally
so exhausted that she could barely concentrate on anything. Magical
training was usually much theory, but Naminè had proven to be
completely incapable of understanding the complex theory and Aerith
had no choice but to teach her via learning-by-doing, which lead
often to severe destruction of the surrounding things. That was the
reason they were practicing near the maw.</P><P>It
was much harder to master a spell than simply improve one's physical
ability. Although she understood the basics, Naminè had only managed
to cast the basic versions of Ice and Lightning, as well as Cure.
Anything above that had proven to be significantly harder. Although
Aerith was specialized in defensive magic, she tried to teach Naminè
also the offensive branch.</P><P>“Try
to close your eyes, concentrate on the force you can form with your
mind, imagine the form the spell should take, and shape the magic
energy into the form you desire. This time, try a Icera spell. Icera
is the second level spell of the Ice branch, like the name implies.
My Icera is a storm of ice crystals, but yours will most likely look
different,” Aerith explained.</P><P>She
had to protect herself with a Reflecga spell; although Naminè had no
technique, her raw magical energy was many times greater than
Kairi's. It wasn't close to what she was capable of, and it wasn't
enough to even attempt summons, but it would suffice for the third
class spells and in the future eventually above those.</P><P>Naminè
concentrated and tried to imagine how the spell would take form.
Shaping magical energy in one's own mind was a very tiring process
and they were at it for hours. She had improved on the Cura spell as
well as mastered the basic form of Reflect. But she had severe
problems with anything that surpassed the level one grade.</P><P>Naminè
could use Monochrome as magical amplifier, and it was also a bit
easier to actually succeed in casting when she used it. Aerith didn't
know how it worked, and even Kairi did casting magic entirely
different from how Naminè did.</P><P>Kairi
was not able to use recited spells, but Naminè was. It was a
optional part to increase the power behind whatever magic one was
casting.</P><P>“An
eternity of waiting, forever stare, an infinity of time, frozen
crystal!” Naminè called out and directed Monochrome towards a set
of rocks.</P><P>First
nothing seemed to happen and after Aerith wanted to tell her to try
again, a cold wind gave her goosebumps. Around the rocks was slowly
building a massive ice crystal, completely wrapping the rocks in
them.</P><P>It
was a impressive crystal. But that was hardly a usable spell in
combat. And that was the sole purpose of this training.</P><P>“You're
really improved. But I need to say that this won't do, dear. The
crystal took so long to build up that every Heartless would have
escaped by then. If you need any advice, I suggest a defensive
version, close to what you just did. Instead of making it a crystal,
try a wall, and directly in front of you, not further away. It would
make a magnificent defense spell to block anything that's rushing
straight at you,” Aerith said but was kind of proud. Kairi had
taken a long time to get to the level she was at. Any further
improvement was impossible for her. She had reached her limits.</P><P>Naminè
had already a slight headache but gave the woman a nod.</P><P>The
same procedure, but a different reciting.</P><P>“Prison
of unbreakable cold, keep of snow, protect me!”</P><P>The
reaction was devastating. In a circle of three foot around Naminè
materialized a massive ice wall, completely surrounding and
imprisoning her. Aerith had to smile as she saw Naminè's puzzled
expression.</P><P>“People
of the flames, dance!” Aerith recited and downright blasted one
side of the ice wall with a fira spell.</P><P>Naminè
smiled a bit embarrassed and walked over to where Aerith was
standing.</P><P>“Can
we stop for today? My head is hurting really bad,” Naminè asked.</P><P>At
the same time, Tifa came by and didn't dare to come closer than about
fifty foot. She still had the accident from the other day in bad
memory. If her lover hadn't be so fast and protected her with a
Reflecga spell, she would have suffered severe burns.</P><P>Aerith
smiled at her and waved her over, signalizing that they were done for
today.</P><P>“Sure
dear. I think Olette and Kairi are quite exhausted too. Why don't you
go and see them?”</P><P>Naminè
was rubbing her forehead when she passed Tifa, who gave her a “Good
work” and then captured Aerith for a kiss.</P><P>“You're
acting like we just got together. What's the occasion?” Aerith
teased but didn't make any effort to break free from Tifa.</P><P>“It's
been a few days since Olette and Naminè arrived and they're already
that used to living here. It's nice to have them in the house. Kairi
is much more energetic than usual. Makes me happy. And you too,
doesn't it?” Tifa replied and laid both arms around her lover's
waist, drawing her even closer.</P><P>“You're
right, but don't forget that at least Olette is still looking for a
way home,” Aerith said and laid her hands on Tifa's neck.</P><P>“I
feel somewhat bad about it, but when I see how Kairi is opening up to
them, I don't feel like having one of them go back to their own
world. And there is also the issue with the Heartless. And leave
alone the Heartless, the Organization... did you cut your hair?”
Tifa suddenly changed the topic and looked a bit closer at Aerith's
face.</P><P>“That
was Naminè,” Aerith said a bit embarrassed and tried to hide her
sloppy cut hair.</P><P>“You're
so cute when you get embarrassed, Aerith-pon,” Tifa said and
started giggling.</P><P>“Don't
call me that,” Aerith said, now even blushing.</P><P>It
had been ages since Tifa called her that, and when she remembered
when she did, it made her blush like a ripe tomato.</P><P>“How
about I cook today? I'll make some curry,” Tifa changed the topic
again.</P><P>Although
Aerith loved Tifa's food, it was kind of inedible for the girls. And
Tifa knew that.</P><P>“Kairi
will complain again. And I guess Olette too,” Aerith smiled and
leaned her forehead against Tifa's.</P><P>It
really felt like their little family had just grown a bit. But that
was only a temporary feeling of happiness. The Organization was still
out there and the Heartless too.</P><P>“They'll
bear with it. I'll make it a bit less spicy. I don't know what they
have against my food, though. They're just spoiled by your cooking,”
Tifa teased again.</P><P>“It's
okay if you understand,” Aerith replied and gave her lover a deep
kiss.</P><P>“Shall
we go?” Tifa asked and knew the answer long before hand.</P><P>“Let's
just stay like this for a while,” Aerith replied and the next kiss
followed.</P><p align='center'>--Valiant
Hearts--</P><P>“I
feel like I want to die,” Olette moaned and laid on the couch in
the living room. Naminè had been the first to be back, and therefore
the first to get to shower. Though, Olette was sure that at least
once the past few days, Naminè had offered Kairi to shower with her.</P><P>It
made her blush every time when Kairi walked out of the shower wrapped
in just a big towel. Naminè was cute too, but Olette was too busy
with being annoyed at her constant flirting with Kairi. If she liked
her, she should just say so! Olette would!</P><P>“I'm
not tired enough if I am still thinking about stuff like that,” she
continued to moan and closed her eyes and laid back.</P><P>Someone
opened the door; it was most likely Tifa or Aerith. She was too tired
to even say anything to them and just remained where she was, leaned
on the back of the couch with closed eyes.</P><P>Where
was Kairi? She hadn't seen her since this morning. Aerith and Tifa
were busy with training Naminè and herself, but Kairi seemed to have
her own training too. Either she did it by herself or one of the
other people, maybe Leon, taught her.</P><P>Something
was touching her legs, but Olette was too tired to be bothered by
that. Not until something then tickled her nose, Olette simply
refused to open her eyes, drowsing on the couch. But what she saw
when she finally opened her eyes was simply beyond any explanation.</P><P>Kairi
was leaned halfway over Olette, her hair hanging in Olette's face as
she apparently tried to do something behind her. Olette had a prime
view directly at Kairi's chest. She must have been doing some very
tiring training, because she was basically soaked in sweat. It didn't
bother Olette in the slightest. In just seconds, her face had taken a
deeper red than ever.</P><P>“Wh-wh-what
are you doing?” Olette stammered, trying not to stare too obviously
at Kairi's chest.</P><P>That
was hardly possible, because only inches separated the two girls.</P><P>“Oh,
sorry. I thought you were sleeping and I tried to open a window. You
looked so peaceful and cute that I tried to open it without waking
you up,” Kairi explained and finally managed to open the window.</P><P>Fresh
cold air streamed inside and the redhead sat down right next to
Olette.</P><P>Cute?
She looked what? It was almost as if Kairi was teasing her on
purpose.</P><P>“Your
whole face is red. Did you eat some of Tifa's lunch?” Kairi asked,
completely out in the blue why Olette was blushing.</P><P>“Yeah.
Yeah, I accidentally ate some of it. My whole face is burning from
it,” Olette made up an excuse.</P><P>She
still refused to believe that she was attracted to Kairi. The past
few days had been full of situation like these, and Olette couldn't
help herself but believe that she at least was a little bit
interested in girls in general.</P><P>It
was even weirder that Kairi obviously refused to react in any matter
to Naminè's flirting. Either she was not interested and didn't want
to hurt Naminè, or she was and was just shy. Olette was about to get
a headache. This was just one of the many times since she had arrived
at Hollow Bastion that she was thinking about stuff like that. It was
none of her business.</P><P>“Naminè
in the shower?” Kairi asked and seemed to be just as tired as
Olette.</P><P>Olette
just nodded and immediately saw a image of seconds before in her
head. Everyone would have blushed in that situation. That was
completely normal. And Kairi really was attractive. Not only had she
a good figure but also her chest-</P><P>“I
need a breath of fresh air,” Olette said and left the room.</P><P>“Did
I say something wrong?” Kairi wondered and leaned back.</P><P>How
long was Naminè already in the shower? Her clothes basically were
like glued to her body. She wanted to change as soon as possible.
Kairi was amazed that she could still move after that hell ride of
training. Since Tifa was busy with Olette, she had to ask Leon. And
he seemed to forget that Kairi didn't have physical power like Tifa.
They had practiced over six hours, that since three days in a row
now. Her technique had improved a bit, but she was still far away
from being even close to being on par with Leon.</P><P>Kairi
knew that Naminè liked her. It was rather obvious after all what
happened. Just the day after they had started training, Naminè had
offered to share the shower. Even Tifa and Aerith did that very
seldom. And they were a really close couple. Kairi had no idea why
Naminè was so fixated to her. Olette didn't seem to care at all,
beside being a bit annoyed.</P><P>“What
should I do... I don't really want to think about it...” Kairi
sighed and leaned back.</P><P>She
had never expected that this would happen. Sure, at some point the
Heartless would be beaten, the Organization would by a thing of the
past, and if she survived all that, she could look for some romance.
But right now, Kairi wasn't even able to figure out what she liked or
not.</P><P>“Ahhh,
why must things be so complicated?” Kairi moaned and stand up.</P><P>Naminè
wouldn't shower forever, and Olette didn't seem to come back. She
would take the shower. But it was weird that Aerith and Tifa,
although both of the girls were already here, were still out.</P><P>Kairi
left for her room and could feel her muscles aching with every step
on the stairs. She understood why she had to undergo some training,
but this was ridiculous. Whatever Leon said, Kairi would take
tomorrow off. Maybe she would go to the observation deck and just
relax her tired body.</P><P>“Hi
Kairi,” Naminè had just come out of the bathroom, wearing one of
Kairi's shirts and a skirt.</P><P>She
had little choice but to wear some of Kairi's clothes. Aerith however
had promised that once they got some money, they would buy her some
clothes.</P><P>“How
was training?” Kairi asked casually and went in her room to grab a
towel.</P><P>“Please
don't ask me,” Naminè said and rubbed her forehead. The headache
didn't go away after the shower. That was the big disadvantage with
magic. The after effects of training took a while to wear off.</P><P>“I'm
going to shower,” Kairi said and waited for Naminè to move out of
the way.</P><P>“Do
I look good in this?” Naminè asked and picked on the skirt. It was
quite different from what she wore usually but it didn't look bad.</P><P>“I...
think so. Why don't you ask Olette? If she is still taking a breath
of fresh air, get her inside, she will get sick,” Kairi said and
vanished in the bathroom.</P><P>It
was almost as if she was escaping and avoiding Naminè. But what
should she do? Refuse her? Just try and find out if she really liked
girls? Both of those didn't seem like they would end well. For now,
she decided to just try to postpone any decision.</P><P>Kairi
undressed herself and went into the shower. The water felt like a
nice blessing on her skin and her tense muscles. Naminè didn't look
so well and for the energetic Olette to be that tired, they were all
pretty worn out. Maybe it would them do good to skip together
tomorrow.</P><P>Naminè
would follow her anyway if she told her, but Olette didn't look like
she was eager to go. She tried to avoid both of them together as much
as possible.</P><P>The
hot water cleared her mind a bit. She knew just too well that she was
being indecisive with Naminè. But how could she not? She had
appeared out of nowhere, behaving like that. If she indeed would go
out with Naminè, leaving the matter of liking girls or not alone,
what would Aerith and Tifa say? The others? Olette? They would know
that Kairi was just pretending.</P><P>Her
thoughts went empty at that time. It was no use thinking about it
like that. Things had worked out for Aerith and Tifa, and hopefully
they would also work out for her.</P><P>“I
forgot to bring my shampoo. And Aerith will roast me if I use
hers...” Kairi sighed.</P><P>And
to make things worse, Tifa's shampoo was empty. Wrapping herself in
her towel, Kairi unlocked the door and wanted to walk fast into her
room and back, without being seen. The first thing she saw was Olette
that was just passing by and looked quite surprised at a still wet
Kairi.</P><P>“I
forgot my shampoo. Can you get it for me? It's in my room, on the
drawer next to the locker,” Kairi asked, and after Olette nodded,
halfway unconscious, Kairi closed the door and waited impatiently for
Olette to knock.</P><P>Olette
was just too tired to be amazed anymore. Either Kairi did this all on
purpose, and if so, that was the most subtle flirting she had ever
seen, or it was a mere coincidence and heaven itself was playing a
prank at her.</P><P>The
shampoo was where Kairi said. Olette grabbed it and went back to the
bath, knocking one time and talking to Kairi.</P><P>“I
got your shampoo. I'll need a shower too, but you can take your time.
Aerith came just back and told me that Tifa is cooking today,”
Olette said, and remembered the food that Tifa cooked. She had cooked
some downright inedible spicy rice after their first day of training.</P><P>The
door opened a bit and Olette handed over the bottle.</P><P>“Yuffie
is living alone, we can check by there later, she has always some
food to share. That is, if we survive Tifa's food today,” Kairi
said, grabbing the bottle and heading back into the shower.</P><P>Olette
left for her room, where Naminè was laying on her bed, seemingly
asleep and one hand laid on her forehead. Olette still couldn't get
the image from earlier out of her head. What was worse, the more she
tried to forget it, the more clearly she could see it.</P><P>Olette
climbed on her bed, her body aching all over. When she remembered
that she had to get up to take a shower, the shower didn't look so
promising anymore.</P><P>“Olette,
why do you get always mad when I'm close to Kairi?“ Naminè asked
out of nowhere.</P><P>Hadn't
she been asleep? Or did Olette wake her up? However, Olette didn't
answer and tried to pretend to be asleep.</P><P>“I
really like Kairi, but I want to get along with you too,” Naminè
said further.</P><P>“Get
along with me too, huh,” Olette whispered to herself and rolled
over. That wasn't getting along, that was clearly having fallen for
another girl. Naminè didn't seem to even understand that her
affection for Kairi was clearly different from what she felt for
everyone else she liked.</P><P>“Do
you dislike Kairi or me?“</P><P>Olette
couldn't answer.</P><P>Naminè
went up and sat on the edge of her bed. Kairi was very special to
her. She really liked Olette too, and Aerith and Tifa, but they were
all different from Kairi. Then Kairi was her one special person.
Naminè would follow her everywhere, no matter where to.</P><P>And
although Naminè knew exactly that Olette was awake, if she refused
to answer, there was no sense to talk to her for now. She always
refused to answer when she asked her about Kairi.</P><P>Naminè
left the room and with that Olette alone with her thoughts. The blond
girl went downstairs and just got a glimpse of what appeared to be
Tifa and Aerith throwing onions at each other while laughing.</P><P>“Look
what you did! The kitchen looks like you detonated a Firega spell!”
Tifa got out between laughing and evading the onions.</P><P>“And
who started the whole misery?!” Aerith called back and also
laughed.</P><P>“I
don't even know anymore, but if we do this much further, we will be
busy the whole evening with cleaning,” Tifa said and they
immediately stopped. Although Aerith didn't mind cleaning, cleaning
the kitchen was always the worst job of all.</P><P>“You
seem to have fun,” Naminè said and giggled at the two grown women
and sat down in the couch.</P><P>“We
were testing the flight ability of the onions. They need to be light
for my curry,” Tifa said and was blushing like a ripe tomato.</P><P>“Are
Kairi and Olette done with showering?” Aerith asked, not less deep
blushing.</P><P>“Hm,
no. Kairi is still showering, Olette in our room,” Naminè said,
making no effort to hide that she was rather amused by the previous
scene.</P><P>“Naminè
dear, can you do me a favor?” Aerith asked.</P><P>“Yes.
But no more training, my head still hurts,” Naminè said.</P><P>“Don't
worry. It won't be any mental exhausting. I will only have you to go
over to Yuffie's place, to ask her for some tabasco. Ours somehow
vanished, but I suspect Kairi on that,” Aerith said and couldn't
refrain from smiling on the thought that Kairi often stole the
tabasco to prevent Tifa from cooking.</P><P>“That's
okay. I'll be right back,” Naminè said and left.</P><P>The
room was silent for a moment. Something made the air tense, as if as
thunderstorm inside was brewing.</P><P>“Don't
you think that it's dangerous to leave things as they are? Kairi
might be over strained by this. I'm sure Naminè has no idea what
pressure she is putting on her,” Tifa said and went back to slicing
the onions into small cubes.</P><P>“I'm
sure Kairi will do the right thing. If we meddle into this, she will
never get past this step,” Aerith replied.</P><P>“I
hope you're right honey. I have a feeling that something bad is about
to happen.”</P><P>“You
start to sound like a certain someone.”</P><P>“If
you now say I sound like Leon, you're going to sleep on the couch
tonight, Aerith.”</P><p align='center'>--Valiant
Hearts--</P><P>“Why
have I to be like this?”</P><P>Olette
was still laying on her bed, looking in the night sky.</P><P>It
wasn't the best of all feelings to be like this. She was jealous of
Naminè, simply because she was so carefree. She was supposed to be
worried sick about her hometown, her friends, and yet, hadn't spend
much thought at all the past two days.</P><P>“Just
what the heck is wrong with me?” Olette swore and hid herself under
the blanket.</P><p align='center'>--Valiant
Hearts--</P><P>Kairi
was almost afraid to leave the shower. What if Naminè was there?
Every time she saw her, her naive and innocent face, it was as if
that very face was demanding a response to her feelings. But Kairi
couldn't. There was no telling when the Heartless would strike again.
She had to get rid of these thoughts.</P><P>Maybe
Kairi could ask Olette what she was supposed to do. She was supposed
to have had a normal life so far. She would know.</P><P>Yes,
that was a good idea. Still drying her hair, Kairi left the bathroom
and headed over to the room that Naminè and Olette were using as
bedroom. Knocking once at the door, something on the upper bed moved
appalled, and seconds later, Olette was looking a bit disturbed from
above at her.</P><P>“Uhm...
the... shower is free” Kairi said and could have immediately banged
her head against the door frame. “And... I need to talk to you,”
she said, with a much more serious face.</P><P>What
could Kairi want? Was it about earlier? Had she noticed after all
that Olette had been staring at her chest, being halfway forced or
not?</P><P>“What
you wanna talk about?” Olette started and jumped down from her bed.</P><P>“I'll
just come straight to the point. I'll end up just talking nonsense
the other way,” Kairi sighed and took a very deep breath.</P><P>Olette
was about to faint, so tense she was. What in hell's name was up with
Kairi? She had not been looking so serious since she had formally
reported to Leon what had happened at the mansion.</P><P>“What
should I do about Naminè? It is so obvious that she likes me but...”
Kairi turned around, almost as if looking out that Naminè was not
around, “what should I do? I just can't agree to that and act like
I like her out of the blue. But unless I tell her straight out that I
can't, she won't understand, I guess. But how I am supposed to tell
this girl that I can't respond to her feelings?” Kairi looked
behind her again and walked over to the cupboard, taking a seat on
it.</P><P>Olette
could feel a with every second bigger getting lump in her throat. Why
didn't Kairi ask Aerith or Tifa? Why her? Why? Just why her out of
all people available? How was Olette supposed to answer that,
struggling with her own problems like that. But she couldn't just
remain silent. She had to say something. Something. Anything.
Anything at all was okay. As long as she didn't make a even longer
silent break as she already did.</P><P>“Are
you surprised? You're so quiet, I thought you already noticed that-”
Kairi was cut off.</P><P>“No,
I know, I know. It's obvious. And I think you should just tell her
that you can't like her now. For now, that is. You need time. Tell
her you will start out as friends,” Olette said.</P><P>Just
what in heaven's name was she blurting out? Had she gone completely
retarded? “Start out as friends” the hell! Kairi would in the
best case laugh at her and ask Aerith. In the worst, she would think
really badly of her now. Why didn't she say something else? Anything
would have been fine. But now it was out.</P><P>“I
mean-” Olette started to try to clean up her mess.</P><P>“I
think that might just work. But... I don't feel so good about it. Can
you help me out and play along with this “be just friends” thing?
Please? I would be much easier for me,” Kairi said and looked with
those for help looking eyes at Olette, one cannot withstand.</P><P>“Sure.
No problem. I'll be happy to be your friend,” Olette replied
without even thinking once about her reply.</P><P>“You're
really nice, thank you,” Kairi said, jumped from the cupboard, went
past Olette out of the room and left a whisper of “That's really
nice of you” in Olette's ear.</P><P>The
heart of the brunette was jumping like a rubber ball in a glass
bottle. How much worse could it possibly get?</P><P>“Yeah,
I'll be happy to be your friend, my ass!!” Olette swore, kicked
against the door frame, hurt her foot, grabbed her towel, went inside
the bathroom and closed the door hard enough to make a sound echo
through the whole house.</P><p align='center'>--Valiant
Hearts--</P><P>Yuffie
was searching through a mess that could, on a barely human standard,
be called a former kitchen. The whole apartment looked like a couple
chaos bombs had been blown up inside and no one was around to clean
for about a eternity.</P><P>Naminè
had somehow found a clean place to sit while Yuffie was searching for
the tabasco she had put somewhere. According to her, it was only a
matter of seconds to find it. A matter of about a few seconds that
already took about ten minutes.</P><P>“So,
how are things going?” Yuffie asked and threw something
indescribable away.</P><P>“My
head hurts the whole time.“ Naminè was remembering today's magic
training with Aerith and holding her forehead. Her head was still
aching.</P><P>“Yeah,
she is sometimes a bit hard to understand,“ Yuffie said with a
giggle.</P><P>“It
is just really exhausting,“ Naminè replied.</P><P>“So,
did you confess already?“ Yuffie asked but didn't stop rampaging
through her apartment.</P><P>“What
do you mean?“</P><P>Naminè
was now a bit thrown off. What should she have confessed?</P><P>“Did
you confess to Kairi?“ Yuffie said, now having stopped and looking
at Naminè.</P><P>“What
should I confess?” Naminè asked with a completely innocent smile.</P><P>“Oh,
never mind then,” Yuffie said and got back to her never ending
search for the tabasco.</P><P>Yuffie
occasionally threw a few things across the room and finally found the
tabasco in a drawer behind a pile of old dishes.</P><P>“Kairi
is a bit... I dunno. I never really understood her. She had it really
hard though. Never had much time to befriend anyone, all the time
looking for a way to rescue her friends. You and Olette are the first
ones to have that sort of relationship with her, I guess,” Yuffie
said with a enormous grin and petted Naminè's head.</P><P>“You
guess?” Naminè looked quite puzzled.</P><P>“Yup.
Now go, before Tifa kicks down my door, because she thinks I'd want
to keep you all for myself.”</P><P>“Why
would you do that?” Naminè asked and was almost startled with
Yuffie leaned towards her and was awfully close.</P><P>“Because
I like cute innocent girls like you,” Yuffie said with a truly evil
grin.</P><P>“You
do?” Naminè was quite surprised.</P><P>“Nah.
I just need someone to clean this place once in a while. I'm
completely useless when it comes to cleaning,” Yuffie's grin got
even bigger, as if she was proud of being unable to maintain a clean
household.</P><P>“I
don't really know how to clean either,” Naminè replied, and Yuffie
started to laugh, Naminè to giggle.</P><P>Naminè
then left, heading back to the house the girl she loved was living.
She would definitely make it. It had been this way ever since she had
seen Kairi in the top floor of the castle. It was different from
simple affection. It was way beyond that. Something that connected
her with Kairi. Something uncut able. But what did Yuffie mean with
“confess“?</P><p align='center'>--Valiant
Hearts--</P><P>“What
the hell am I doing?” Olette was still upset, even after taking a
shower. But what should she have done in that kind of situation? Just
blurt out that she thinks she may be into girls and possibly
interested to some point in her? Kairi would have avoided her just
like she did with Naminè.</P><P>“At
least, this way I'll be able to find out if I like her or not,”
Olette sighted in resignation.</P><P>Today
must been her most unlucky day in all history, with exception for the
day time stopped in Twilight Town and this whole dilemma started.</P><P>There
was a really biting smell that almost knocked her out when Olette
opened the door. It was almost strong enough to pass as dangerous
acid gas.</P><P>That
could only mean one thing. It was time to eat.</P><P>“And
I thought the day couldn't get any worse,” Olette sighed.</P><p align='center'>--Valiant
Hearts--</P><P>Kairi
was laying in her bed, rolling over in pain, and holding her stomach.</P><P>Tifa's
cooking was like poison for her, but going to bed with a empty
stomach was even worse. It didn't seem like Olette or Naminè took
the food particularly good either. They both had looked like glowing
tomatos after the meal.</P><P>“I
still wonder how Aerith can like this inhuman spicy stuff,” Kairi
muttered and got up. There was no way she could sleep while her
stomach was aching like that.</P><P>Kairi
would always sit on the rooftop of the house and watch the stars in
the night when she couldn't sleep. It was quite warm tonight, so
Kairi was going up, just with her super long shirt that she wore to
sleep.</P><P>But
someone had already taken her place. Olette was laying on her back
and seemed to watch the stars. Right next to her sat Naminè, gazing
on the dark horizon, as if something was there only she could see.</P><P>Kairi
chose not to disturb those two when Naminè started to talk. It was
really poor manners, but Kairi couldn't resist eavesdropping. For
whatever reason, Kairi wanted to know what they would talk about with
her not around. Although they slept in the same room, they didn't
seem to talk much to each other.</P><P>“Say
Olette. Why-” Naminè said and a little bit furious, Olette went
up, looked quite angry and finally snapped.</P><P>“Stop
asking already. It's... I don't know! I want to know too. Why the
heck am I so uncomfortable with you around Kairi. I wouldn't sit
there and be annoyed if I knew,” Olette basically shouted and then
went up, walking a bit further up the roof and laying down there.</P><P>“Don't
you like Kairi?” Naminè then asked, now gazing at Olette, instead
of the horizon.</P><P>Kairi
was more than just tense. She had notice that Olette behaved a bit
odd when Naminè had been clung to her and several other times Olette
had been annoyed for no reason. And they were talking about this,
about her, right now.</P><P>“What
do you mean 'like', Naminè? Like, like you do? Or like as girl? Like
as friend? I guess if I have to say one of them, I'll go with the
last. I only meet her a few days back, and although we're all here,
playing happy family, I still don't belong here. I belong to my own
home, Twilight Town. I have my own friends, my own family there. It's
completely different to you!” Olette continued her rant and was mad
at both Naminè and herself.</P><P>Why
was she taking it out on her? Naminè wasn't really the reason Olette
was now here. Nor was it her fault that Olette couldn't go back. It
was stupid to yell at her for no reason, but it really made Olette
feel better.</P><P>Naminè
remained silent for a while, and both, Olette and Kairi, were
thinking the same thing. Olette should apologize for yelling at her.</P><P>“Naminè,
I'm... sorry for yelling. It's not really your fault. I'm totally
confused. I just want to go back to my normal life. A peaceful life.
I-” Olette was cut off.</P><P>“I
only had one friend before I came here. And I don't know where he is
now. Kairi is special to me. But you are too. Aerith and Tifa too,”
Naminè said and went back to gazing at the horizon.</P><P>“Ah...
yeah. Thanks... I guess,” Olette said after a while, a bit
embarrassed.</P><P>Kairi
was somewhat relieved. At least, it seemed like they would be able to
get along. Kairi had completely forgotten about her stomach ache. It
had been the reason she wanted to come up her in the first place. But
it didn't seem like it was necessary now.</P><P>Kairi
got back in her room, and was thinking for a moment, that it would
have been nice if those two could get always get along. Of course,
Kairi had her own issues, but it was a bit different with Naminè and
Olette. They were also Keybladers. It wouldn't put them in any more
danger if she were friends with them.</P><p align='center'>--Valiant
Hearts--</P><P>“Won't
Tifa and Aerith get mad when we just skip training like this?”
Olette asked but still followed Kairi the way up to the observation
deck.</P><P>“They
get mad at me all the time for this. They even ground me sometimes.
But in the end, they always forgive me,” Kairi said and looked
behind her, at the other two.</P><P>Kairi
waited for a moment, Naminè was a bit behind, and Olette stopped
right next to her. She had offered to piggyback Naminè the way up,
but Naminè declined and wanted to climb up by herself.</P><P>“I'm
counting on you. I think today is a good day to... tell her,” Kairi
whispered to Olette.</P><P>Olette
knew that this day would come. She had, in the heat of the moment,
agreed to help Kairi out.</P><P>The
whole idea was a bit retarded, and if Naminè had not been so naive,
it wouldn't work at all. Olette wasn't particularly fond of the idea,
but now backing out was no option.</P><P>It
took them a while, though less than the first time, to get up to the
platform, and it was still forenoon. The sun was still rising, and
the air was warm and fresh up there. It was a little paradise, their
little private paradise. Kairi went over to lean over the handrail
and took a deep breath fresh air. This far up, the air was more clean
than below.</P><P>“I
feel like in heaven,” Olette moaned and stretched out, laying on a
bench.</P><P>The
sun was shining through the glass, and although it was so far up, it
was not blinding. The warm light really made this feel like a
paradise.</P><P>Naminè
was standing next to Kairi and instead of acting like usual, and
trying to cling to Kairi, she imitated her.</P><p align='center'>--Valiant
Hearts--</P><P>“I
think you should give her some free space. I don't really know Kairi,
but I think you're sticking a bit too close to her,” Olette said,
despite the nagging voice in her head.</P><P>“What
do you mean, free space?” Naminè asked.</P><P>Now
that got Naminè's interest. If it was about Kairi, it really was
easy to get her to listen.</P><P>“How
do I put it that you understand it? Even when you're together with
Kairi, don't cling so close to her. Think of her as a friend,”
Olette explained.</P><P>She
didn't believe that Naminè got what she meant, but it was worth a
try. If Naminè understood, Kairi would have some free time to order
her thoughts. And Olette too. To be witness to Naminè's constant
approaching wasn't the best thing that came to mind when trying to
figure out certain things.</P><P>“But
why would I do that?” Naminè said and went up, walking over to
Olette.</P><P>“You'll
see that when you do,” Olette replied and also went up.</P><P>“Let's
get some sleep. My stomach calmed down. I seriously wonder how Aerith
can eat two plates of... it, and still smile at Tifa all the way.
Does she have a iron stomach?” Olette said and shook her head with
incomprehension.</P><P>Olette
left for the window that lead to her own room, it was comfortable
directly above her bed.</P><P>“Naminè,
you still want to stay?”</P><P>“Hm,
no. I'm coming. I just thought about what you said. I'm really sleepy
actually.”</P><P>Naminè
could go first, that way Olette didn't have to leave her bed even
once before finally going to sleep now. She didn't even change into
other clothes. Naminè on the other hand changed into a long shirt
she had inherited from Kairi.</P><P>“Good
night.”</P><P>“Hm,
good night Olette.”</P><P>Kairi
however was still on the roof and couldn't suppress a laugh anymore.
It was kind of cute of those two to talk about things like that but
also a bit embarrassing. But Olette really was right. Kairi wouldn't
feel all that under pressure when Naminè reduced her clinging a bit.</P><P>“Uh,
time for bed. I'll catch those two tomorrow before they leave for
training. They won't mind a free day either.”</P><p align='center'>--Valiant
Hearts--</P><P>“I
could lay the whole day here and watch the sky. Kairi, have you ever
been up here when it rained? I imagine that to be so cool,” Olette
said and just turned her head slightly, to see where Kairi was
standing with Naminè. It did bother her; not much though. The sky
was just too much to distract her. Olette had always been a sucker
for high places, and this one was this awesome view on top of it.</P><P>“No.
Most of the times, I'm not so long up here, because it gets a bit
lonely after some time. And going up while it rains is so dangerous
that I never tried,” Kairi said, turning around and leaning on the
handrail, bending a bit over, looking at the sky.</P><P>“I
think there was somewhere a mechanism to open the glass roof, but I
never found it, only read about it in the blueprints of this,”
Kairi said and didn't know what kind of effect this would cause.</P><P>“We
could open it? Are you sure? That would be so awesome! Let's look for
it!” Olette shouted, quite excited.</P><P>“I
told you, I've looked for it. I think it is either broken or was
never completed,” Kairi said, looking a bit troubled to destroy
Olette's enthusiasm like that.</P><P>“Can't
Cid build or repair it?” Olette asked.</P><P>That
had never occurred once to Kairi. It was her special place, and to
ask Cid meant that everyone knew about it. She wouldn't be able to
hide here and quietly enjoy the view or anything else here.</P><P>“It's
very old and Cid is really busy with the data he got from the
terminal at the Organization headquarters. Let's just forget about
it, okay?” Kairi said, and her smile changed to a more serious
expression.</P><P>Olette
decided against arguing with her; that would completely ruin all
this.</P><P>The
three went back to a state of just enjoying the environment, and
quite a bit of time went by with just Olette laying there, Kairi and
Naminè standing on the handrail and none of them saying anything.
The wind was gentle and the sun warm; there was nothing more one
could wish for except maybe being on green grass. Olette had almost
fallen asleep when Naminè joined her and sat down next to her,
looking straight up, in the sky.</P><P>“Thank
you,” she said.</P><P>Olette
took a moment to comprehend, but seeing how Kairi didn't even move a
inch away from her, all those time, Naminè must been thinking that
it was because she didn't try to actually cling on her.</P><P>“Don't
worry about it.”</P><P>A
few minutes later, they had been silent since then, Kairi joined the
other two at the benches and went to a pose of halfway laying back
and sitting, resting on her elbows. Together, the three looked like
best friends from far away.</P><P>Kairi
was wondering when and where she should start. If she could just go
to a state of friendship with those two, it would help a lot. It
would annul the pressure, and Kairi was sure, they could get along
anyway. In one sense, they even had to, all of them being chosen of
the Keyblade. But that was just on the battlefield. Kairi didn't want
it to be like that. Naminè and Olette were really nice girls, and it
was a shame that Kairi had to resort to tricks like this to get along
with both of them.</P><P>How
long had they been here? How long would it stay this way? Deep
inside, Kairi wished to stay like this forever. Without the fight
against the Heartless, the Organization, everything. Just staying
here, with those two, enjoying the ever blue sky, the white clouds
that traveled a sky sea of blue, the wind that went gently through
the few openings in the glass wall and blew their hair and over their
faces, the sun that warmed them up, sending her light down to them.
But that wish wouldn't be granted. Kairi had a mission; all three of
them shared that. There was no escape from it, but at least she
wasn't alone on that path anymore.</P><P>But
Kairi had to do one important step before that.</P><P>“Naminè,”
Kairi started. If this really worked, it was all good.</P><P>“Yes?”</P><P>“I
know you... like me. And... well. I barely know you. I feel there is
something special about you. But... I just can't suddenly think of
you like that. I tried but it won't work. I'm not saying that I never
will. But for now... can we just be friends? Until we, I mean I, know
you better?“</P><P>Olette
was giving her a certain look, and a bit hasty, Kairi added another
line in.</P><P>“Of
course I want to be friends with you too Olette. You seem like a nice
girl too.”</P><P>Olette
sighed and then laughed, a bit forcefully, but it was really funny to
hear it like that. Kairi was not the best to say such things.</P><P>“I'm
a nice girl, huh,” Olette whispered to herself and then gave away a
big smile. “That's a sure thing for me. Although I still want to go
home. I have friends of my own. Even... even if I am forced to do
this Keyblade business, I still have my own friends. I still need to
protect them from whatever you've been fighting. I think it's a good
idea,” Olette said and meant most of it.</P><P>Naminè
was a bit surprised to say the least. She didn't know much about how
Kairi felt, but even Naminè had noticed that Kairi had been acting
much different to the last few days today. If it could be all the
time like this, it was a lot better than the other way around. Naminè
didn't feel so happy about it at the moment, but she gave it a happy
nod.</P><P>“But
you need to promise me,” Naminè said, bringing up conditions of
her own.</P><P>“Promise
what?” Kairi replied.</P><P>She
demanded a great deal from Naminè, so it was natural that Kairi
should agree to whatever the blond girl proposed.</P><P>“You
won't leave me all alone. Ever. We will stay together forever,”
Naminè said and gave Kairi one of those looks that made one really
feel guilty.</P><P>What
should she do? It wasn't something that could be promised too easily
in the first place, even though Kairi had done it once in the past.</P><P>Kairi
had promised the exact same thing long ago. Sora, Riku and herself
had promised to stay together, no matter what came. And not only did
she break that promise once, when the Destiny Islands got consumed by
the darkness and Sora and Riku vanished, but twice when Kairi sealed
Kingdom Hearts, knowing that she would lose Sora and Riku again with
that.</P><P>But
this was completely different. Naminè didn't just want to be her
friend. The girl loved her, and that was very clear. But Naminè
wouldn't agree to starting out as friends if she would not promise
this.</P><P>“Naminè,
even if we stay together, don't forget your promise. We're just
friends now, and friends don't cling to each other like you did when
we were here the last time. I will stay by your side, as long as you
want, but for now, I will only do it as friend,“ Kairi felt that it
was necessary to explain this to Naminè.</P><P>The
blond girl didn't really like what Kairi said, but it couldn't be
helped. If that was Kairi's wish, Naminè would abide by that.</P><P>Kairi
took a deep breath and tried to order her thoughts. She wouldn't
break such a promise again. Never. So should she really promise to
stay by her side?</P><P>Naminè
couldn't see it, but Olette showed Kairi a sign of approval.</P><P>Kairi
looked directly at Naminè. It had proven to be a good idea to ask
Olette, so Kairi trusted her judgement.</P><P>“Okay,
I promise,” Kairi replied, and was immediately jumped on by Naminè.
It wasn't really nice that immediately after Naminè promised to only
see her as a friend to jump Kairi for a few seconds, but for only
this one time, Kairi would let it go.</P><P>Olette
was amazed that it was this easy. Naminè really seemed to agree to
anything as long as Kairi was the one that proposed it. There was a
nagging voice in her head that scolded her for proposing this idea in
the first place. It was really anything but nice to manipulate things
this way. Olette could think of several reasons one would do this,
but all of them didn't seem very nice. To make it worse, the target
of all this was Naminè, who had no idea she was being manipulated.</P><P>For
a moment, Naminè was looking quite disappointed, but almost like out
of a comedy movie, Olette saved the moment.</P><P>“I'm
hungry. Say, Kairi, don't tell me you completely forgot about
bringing any food? I can't stay here the whole day without even a
snack.” Olette broke the atmosphere of the moment.</P><P>There
was a really awkward silence. Usually, Kairi never stayed so long up
here. There was no need to bring food or anything along. But they had
been here since quite some time. Now that Olette said it, Kairi got a
bit hungry herself.</P><P>“Uhm,
we could go back down and try to get something. We're basically
screwed if Tifa or Aerith find us,” Kairi suggested.</P><P>“I'd
rather avoid being beaten to a pulp by Tifa today. I still think she
is some monster out of a movie. I never even once met someone that
had even remotely that much power! Tifa scares the hell out of me
when she rushes at me like that. Why don't they go out and fight
against those Organization or whatever? They seem so far stronger
than we are.”</P><P>“World
balance. Every world has its own rules. We chosen of the Keyblade
don't abide by those rules and we are free to move from world to
world. But normal people like Tifa or Aerith aren't. If they go with
me, it disturbs the balance of the worlds. They can't stay too long
in one particular world without ruining the balance. There are
certain exceptions. Hollow Bastion is a world that was created by
Ansem the Wise. A real world created by man. That is the reason that
the normal rules don't apply here. Another exception is the
headquarters of the Organization XIII. We don't care about the
balance of that world. It will be destroyed in the end,” Kairi
explained.</P><P>Olette
sighed. She didn't understand all this stuff about world balance. Her
head started to ache and she went back to her laying position. If the
decision was to be hungry or get possibly found out by Tifa, she
would rather stay hungry.</P><P>Naminè
wasn't exactly hungry, but the thought alone of magic training
inflicted pain in her head. Beside, after that almost literally
hellish food yesterday, Naminè hadn't exactly an urge to eat
anything at all now.</P><P>“I'll
go alone later and try to get us some snacks or something. I'm pretty
good at getting away,” Kairi sighed and went back to watching at
the horizon.</P><P>How
long had it been that she had talked with other people her age like
that? Three years now? Riku and Sora must also have grown up. But
Kairi wasn't the weak girl from back then anymore. She had to become
stronger and stronger to beat the Heartless and especially Ansem. It
was thanks to Aerith that Kairi had survived the last battle. If
Aerith had not found her near the doors of Kingdom Hearts, where
Kairi had passed out, exhausted way beyond her limits, unable to even
do a single step...</P><P>The
girls stayed for another hour up on the observation deck until Olette
started to continuously complain about her empty stomach. Kairi went
back to the house and managed to grab a few apples and some snacks,
stuffing them all into a rucksack she had kept in her room.</P><P>Luck
or whatever reason, Kairi made it safely back, and no one had
followed her.</P><P>“Help
yourself,” Kairi said and put the rucksack next to the benches.</P><P>“Yay,
food!” Olette cheered and went to annihilate the content of the
rucksack.</P><P>There
wasn't much beside watching the sky and the sunset a bit later that
day. It was peaceful and quiet up there. It was a boon to relax a
day. Leon had been taking the training much too seriously.</P><P>The
one time Naminè and Olette went to check up on her, they had been
quite shocked about her training. Kairi got pretty beaten up by Leon,
and although she improved, it was much too hard for her. If Aerith
had not held the girls back, they would have attacked Leon, thinking
that he was dead serious.</P><P>The
sun was almost gone when they decided to go down.</P><p align='center'>--Valiant
Hearts--</P><P>“Are
you sure Yuffie? I never heard of it like that,” Leon asked,
looking quite troubled.</P><P>The
black haired ninja put on a offended expression and leaned a bit
towards Leon, pointing with a finger at him.</P><P>“If
you don't stop being so critical about my reports, you can go the
next time!” Yuffie complained.</P><P>“That
is really bad. We haven't been to that world even once. We need to
tell Kairi. We can't afford any delay. If we wait just a few more
days, the world will be consumed by the Heartless,” Leon ordered.</P><P>“Who
will go with her? The two new girls?” Yuffie asked, before leaving
to tell Kairi of the new mission.</P><P>“Are
you mad? They haven't had enough training, by far. I wouldn't send
Kairi out at all if this weren't a emergency. Tifa and Aerith will go
with her, and if we can find him, Tifa shall drag Cloud along,”
Leon almost yelled at her.</P><P>“I
doubt Kairi will agree with that. Not only did the other two girls
train like slaves, but Kairi is always worrying about the balance of
worlds anyway. She'll make a huge ruckus, if I tell her that Olette
and Naminè have to stay here and Aerith, Tifa and Cloud go with
her,” Yuffie said with a bit of a doubting expression.</P><P>“I
don't care if Kairi agrees or not,” Leon said with a ice cold face
and went to call on Cid. They needed his machine to open the gateway
enough to allow someone beside Kairi, the Keyblader, to pass through.</P><P>Yuffie
left and headed over to Aerith and Tifa's house. The world had been
in a really grave situation. The Heartless must have found some hole
in the barrier between the worlds. There were hordes of them. Not
only that; Yuffie had asked around in that world. Disguised as
sailor, it had been easy to get information. Apparently, a man in a
black coat had been seen several times.</P><P>“I
wonder if it's the Organization.”</P><P>It
was already dark out there, and even though it was still warm, Yuffie
couldn't get in a good mood. Kairi would disagree with Leon's
decision and the other two girls probably as well.</P><P>Yuffie
didn't give much on manners, and Aerith had told her once that she
was always welcome in her house. That had been before she got
together with Tifa, though.</P><p align='center'>--Valiant
Hearts--</P><P>“I'm
a bit mad that Kairi skipped training. But we gave them a really hard
time. I can understand her a bit,” Tifa said.</P><P>The
black haired woman was laying on the couch, her head resting on
Aerith's lap, looking up to her lover.</P><P>“Olette
and Naminè never trained before. I think we may have overdone it a
bit. And I need to talk with Leon. Naminè told me the other day of
his training with Kairi. He is taking it too far I think,” the
other woman replied.</P><P>Aerith
was playing with Tifa's hair, once in a while teasing the nose of her
girlfriend with a strand of her own hair, getting a few annoying
comments from her.</P><P>“But
it's nice to have some time for ourselves too. It is exhausting to
play trainer everyday. I'm sure you feel like that too, Aerith-pon,”
Tifa said, grabbing the left hand of her lover, kissing it, and
preventing any more childish play with her hair.</P><P>“Just
that you know, you're going to comb my hair later. I'm sure it's all
messed up thanks to you,” Tifa said, pretending to be angry.</P><P>Aerith
freed her hand, laying both of them on Tifa's cheeks and leaning
over.</P><P>“Seems
I'm disturbing you. You two know where Kairi is?” Yuffie asked, out
of the blue. She had been standing for a while there; neither of the
women had heard the door opening.</P><P>“What
do you want, plague?” Tifa said, not pretending to be angry
anymore.</P><P>It
was Yuffie's special talent to show up when Tifa was flirting with
Aerith. And it happened quite often too.</P><P>Aerith
bent over, whispering something in Tifa's ear, which made her blush a
bit, and then looked over to Yuffie. The two didn't mind Yuffie
seeing them like that, but it always ruined any romantic mood.</P><P>“Right
behind you, Yuffie,” Aerith answered with a smile.</P><P>Yuffie
turned around and found indeed Kairi and the other two girls standing
right behind her. They looked a bit confused. Yuffie didn't seem like
she had come over for a friendly visit.</P><P>“New
mission Kairi. You know the keyhole portal in the library in the
castle? The one we ignored for quite some time? I checked the world
out, and its basically under attack from the Heartless. Leon ordered
you, Tifa and Aerith to go and exterminate the Heartless. I need to
warn you that-” Yuffie was cut off by Olette.</P><P>“What?
We've trained like slaves, and now we're simply left behind to look
after the house? Leon can't be serious about that!” Olette
complained quite loudly.</P><P>Olette
was angry about being left out, not about being unable to go to
another world and fight against whatever there was. If one thing
annoyed her, then it was being left out or being ignored.</P><P>“I
knew you would complain but Leon is as obstinate as a rock. He won't
give a inch in this matter,” Yuffie replied, shook her head and
looked at Kairi.</P><P>“Cid
is repairing his machine. He'll be ready tomorrow morning. I need to
get some sleep, I have another surveillance mission the day after
tomorrow. Good luck Kairi.”</P><P>With
that, Yuffie left.</P><P>Kairi
was looking quite angry, Olette no less. Naminè didn't seem to
understand much of it, but that Kairi had such a expression didn't
please her either.</P><P>“What
is Leon thinking? He knows that sending non-Keyblader to other worlds
causes disturbances! And then, to a complete new world on top of
that. Olette and Naminè had plenty of training, didn't they?”
Kairi looked over to Tifa and Aerith. Tifa had left her position and
stood up, Aerith still sitting on the couch.</P><P>“I
know what you feel like right now. But I have to agree with Leon.
Olette and Naminè don't have enough training yet, and I'd rather
look after you myself, with the Organization and all going on,”
Tifa said.</P><P>Kairi
didn't say anything. No matter what she would say, in the end Tifa
and Aerith worried too much about her. She wasn't the only Keyblader
anymore, and it was downright stupid to still send other people with
her to another world. One day, the disturbance would have a great
effect on the worlds.</P><P>“Just
what reason has Leon to ignore always everything I accomplish? But
it's not only that! This time, he ignores all three of us! What do we
train for in the first place if we don't get taken seriously? They
have been trained just as hard as I do, but I bet Leon didn't even
consider once that I could actually complete a mission without having
both of you with me.“</P><P>Olette
was a bit flattered that Kairi said it like that, but it was more
than the average weird occurrence that Kairi was yelling like that at
Tifa and Aerith. Olette understood the problem, but this wouldn't
solve anything.</P><P>“Let's
stop that Kairi, it's not going to help if you yell and-“ Kairi
waved with her hand and continued her rant. Olette knew from her own
experience that it was a bit hopeless to ask her to reason now.</P><P>Tifa
wanted to throw some arguments back, but Kairi didn't give her the
chance.</P><P>“You
two are so incredible powerful, I always feel unnecessary when I go
with you. I bet, if one of you would be the Keyblade's chosen, Leon
wouldn't even take notice of my existence!“ Kairi yelled and talked
herself more into anger with every word.</P><P>“That
is not true dear, I'm sure that-“ Aerith couldn't even finish one
line.</P><P>“I
know you two worry about me, I would too if the roles were the other
way around, but I can basically sit around and wait for you at the
portal until the Heartless are defeated. I know it's bad to get hurt,
and I don't like that either, but it hurts even more to be useless
like that! Then what do I train so hard for? What do they train for?
To sit one day at the portal, like I did so many times? We could as
well just stop training!“</P><P>Naminè
had been looking in turns at Kairi, who seemed to be about to
explode, and Aerith and Tifa, whom looked more worried about her than
angry. Kairi was really scary that way, and Naminè tried to get her
attention with taking her hand.</P><P>“Kairi,
don't yell like that, it's scary,“ Naminè said, but Kairi didn't
even notice her attempt to end this.</P><P>Olette
had her own quarrels with her parents, and some of them ended like
this too, but the cause of those things wasn't even remotely close to
what the topic here was. It was awkward to see Kairi arguing like
this with her, more or less, parents.</P><P>“I'm
really sick of this! I'm not the little girl that just got her
Keyblade anymore! I may be not as strong as Tifa, and can't use magic
like Aerith, but Olette and I held off that Organization member, and
he was ridiculously powerful!“</P><P>“You
got really hurt dear, and if not Olette had been there, who knows
what-“ Aerith tried to dim the flames of her rage.</P><P>“But
Olette is here! She can go with me! And Naminè too! I saw them
train, and I trust them! We are not Keybladers to open the portals
for you, Cloud, Leon, Yuffie or someone else! They chose us for a
reason! We aren't puppets Leon can order around freely!“</P><P>“Leon
is still our leader! And even if I don't like some of his decisions,
he does his job! You, and you two too, may be chosen of the Keyblade.
But that doesn't mean you are invincible! What if the Organization is
on the move? Will you be able to hold three of them off? Like Aerith
and Yuffie did for you in Twilight Town?“ Tifa went back at her.</P><P>“Let's
stop here Kairi. Arguing with your parents gets you nowhere. They
aren't at fault here,“ Olette said and grabbed Kairi's wrist.</P><P>“Yes,
lets stop yelling. I don't like you like that,“ Naminè added in.</P><P>Kairi
wanted to counter something, but after looking at the awkward,
embarrassed and worried faces around her, she couldn't. Tifa was
right, she knew it, but Kairi had her own points too! Olette had let
go of her wrist, and Kairi had enough for today.</P><P>“I'm
going to sleep!!” Kairi shouted, and took both Naminè's and
Olette's hand, dragging them along.</P><P>Kairi
stopped once they had entered the room Olette and Naminè were
sleeping at.</P><P>“This
Idiot! What does he think he is? If not for me, he would still lurk
around in Traverse Town!“ Kairi shouted and kicked against a
drawer.</P><P>“Calm
down Kairi. It's not going to help if you run havoc now“ Olette
said, grabbing her arm.</P><P>“Let
me go! Why do you stay so calm when they're obviously ignoring your
hard work?“ Kairi tried to get free, but Olette was the stronger
one.</P><P>"I
don't really get it, but isn't it good to not get hurt?“ Naminè
said and sat on her bed.</P><P>"That's
not the point. Of course I'm happy if everyone is well, but this is
just ridiculous!“ Kairi replied, slowly losing up.</P><P>"Maybe
you can talk to Leon and he will-“ Olette tried to find a solution
to this drama.</P><P>"He
won't budge an inch. He doesn't believe the slightest in my or your
abilities. Unless I can prove that we three alone are able to-“
Kairi stopped in the middle of the line.</P><P>"Prove
what? Are you okay?“ Olette let go of Kairi and Naminè walked
closer to examine the now completely silent Kairi.</P><P>"But
that's it. We can just go alone. It's too hard to open a portal
alone, but I'm not. You two have Keyblades as well. We'll just sneak
out and accomplish that mission without the help of the others.“</P><P>“I'm
with you,” Olette said. She wouldn't stand for this. What was that
training for? Just for when she got home to rule at struggle? That
couldn't be all! Olette wanted to prove herself to this Leon guy, to
prove that she was not inferior to the others.</P><P>“You
promised to stay with me forever. I'll go with you,” Naminè said
and went to cling to Kairi's arm.</P><P>For
once, Kairi didn't mind. It was okay for now. After all, Naminè had
never really fought against the Heartless. It would be a bit of a
shock for her. And a big conversion.</P><P>“Olette,
I will knock on your window when we set out. You two, pretend to
accept whatever Leon decided for now, I will sulk in my room, to make
it authentic. I trust you two,” Kairi said and with that, their
great escape plan was set in motion.</P><P>Kairi
didn't show up for dinner, and had locked herself up in her room,
refusing to speak with both Tifa and Aerith.</P><P>Olette
and Naminè didn't eat much, both being quiet and then leaving for
their room.</P><P>Aerith
was worried about them, but even Naminè wouldn't speak to her.</P><P>“Don't
you think we've been a bit unfair to them?” Aerith asked.</P><P>She
was sitting on the table, quite worried. Kairi had only once reacted
that bad to something like this. And now, it wasn't just Kairi. That
Kairi was sulking affected Naminè as well, and Olette had her own
reasons to be angry. After all, maybe this new world offered a way
back home for her.</P><P>Tifa
walked behind her, leaning down, laying her arms around Aerith's
shoulders, kissing her neck.</P><P>“Don't
worry about it so much. Kairi won't sulk forever. And at some point,
we can entrust Naminè and Olette with the role of her protectors.
Maybe. I don't feel so well when I think about it, really. But don't
make such a face. I know how you feel. Kairi is like a daughter for
me too. You aren't alone with your worries.”</P><P>“Thank
you. I'm happy to have you at my side.” Aerith laid her own hands
on Tifa's. “Let us go to bed. I'll comb your hair after the
mission, yes? It is always really messy when you fight anyway.”</P><P>“Your
hair ain't no better. Sometimes, you have frozen or burned strands
from all your magic,” Tifa now teased her, pulling a strand of
hair, playing with it. “Revenge,” Tifa giggled, and teased her
lovers nose with it.</P><p align='center'>--Valiant
Hearts--</P><P>“All
ready?” Kairi asked.</P><P>Naminè
gave her a nod, holding onto Monochrome. She wouldn't be a hindrance.
Olette had explained a few basic battle strategics to her. It was a
bit confusing, but Naminè would manage.</P><P>Olette
had a few doubts about this. It wasn't really nice to fight for one's
life, even if it helped a lot of people. Yes, maybe there was a way
back to her world, and on top of all, Olette wanted to prove herself
to the others. For now, Olette had only summoned up her Circle of
Life Keyblade. Only if it was necessary, only in a fight, Olette
summoned the second. She had managed to do it at almost equal speed
to Kairi.</P><P>“Yes,”
both girls simultaneously said.</P><P>“Then
let us go.”</P><P>The
three girls went over the roofs, all in secret, and without being
seen, without being found out by anyone, they reached the castle.</P><P>This
time, there was no one around. Locked doors were no hindrance for
them. They had three all-fitting keys.</P><P>Kairi
had just opened the last lock, the doors of the library, with
Oathkeeper, and they went upstairs.</P><P>“It's
here.” Kairi stopped in front of a bookshelf that gave off a weird
vibe.</P><P>Naminè
and Olette could feel it too. It was as if something inside there was
resonating, reacting to their Keyblades. It wasn't particularly a
nasty feeling, but not a good one either.</P><P>“Concentrate
on your Keyblade with the wish to open a gate. And direct the
Keyblade at the bookshelf. It helps if you close your eyes
beforehand,” Kairi explained and did the first step.</P><P>It
took no longer than a few seconds and a light ray emitted from
Oathkeeper and hit the bookshelf. A small portal, in form of a
keyhole, opened up. Shortly after, Naminè's and Olette's light ray's
fused with the gate, opening it far enough to allow all three of them
to walk through it.</P><P>“We
won't come back here until we finished our mission. Both of you...
are you sure you're ready? There will be Heartless on the path to
another world. We will have to fight even before we reach the world,”
Kairi asked, looking first at Naminè, then Olette.</P><P>Kairi
had her own thoughts. Olette had fought against a Organization
member, she didn't need to worry much about her. She was also being
trained by Tifa. But Naminè didn't improve as much, compared to
Olette, and her physical abilities were to say the least, pretty
terrible. And as far as Kairi knew, she had not even once fought
anything, not even a lesser Heartless. Kairi would have to look out
after her. In a fitting moment, Kairi would ask Olette to play a
guardian role for Naminè.</P><P>Both
gave a nod, and without further questions, without further words,
they stepped together through the gateway.</P><P>It
was only a second after they went through that it closed itself,
leaving them on a dark path.</P><P>The
first lesser Heartless were already waiting for them.</P><P>“Here
we go,” Kairi shouted and rushed ahead.</P>
