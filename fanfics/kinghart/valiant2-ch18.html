are you reading, Naminè?”</P><P>Kairi
looked down, listening to the rustling of the leaves of the majestic
tree whose crown she was abusing as place to relax. A few feet below
sat Naminè, deep in thought, engrossed in another novel. Ever since
Aerith had showed her the library and allowed her to borrow just
about any book in there, Naminè had been busy reading every free
minute. And there was plenty of time right now.</P><P>Training
was finally over, for now at least, and while Olette was gone, as
they found out just earlier this morning, training between themselves
was suspended. It was to Kairi's liking, as she wanted to spend more
time with Naminè. They had gotten closer, but Kairi was still
insecure about confronting her feelings, and much less sure about
accepting Naminè's feelings like this.</P><P>“<I>The
Silver King</I>,” the blond girl replied with her gentle voice. She
was very much aware of Kairi sitting up there, staring down at her,
but she wasn't bothered by it in the slightest. The sun was shining
brightly, and even though she sat in the shadow of this big tree, it
wasn't cold. A slight wind was playing with her hair, showing Kairi
an amazing sight.</P><P>“What's
it about?” Kairi was interested in getting to know Naminè better.
But no matter how good she was at fighting or tactics, she was a
complete klutz when it came to such things. Earlier today, she had
walked in on Naminè showering, and even though the book-loving girl
didn't mind at all, Kairi still scolded herself for just standing
there, her mouth wide open, staring at the naked body of the other
girl. She was cursed with such bad luck.</P><P>“It's
complicated. Want to hear about it?” Naminè finally let go of the
book, looked up, and gave Kairi a true angel-like smile. Wearing her
white favorite dress, the only thing missing were white wings and the
halo. For Kairi, though, she didn't need those things at all. Nodding
as answer to her question, Kairi slowly climbed down, finally sitting
down a few feet away from Naminè.</P><P>“I
don't bite.” And saying so, Naminè stood up, walked over to Kairi
and placed herself right on her lap, leaning back right onto Kairi's
chest. It was sort of an intimate situation and yet not. Kairi knew
that Naminè was more pure than she seemed and had no subtle thoughts
on such things. She simply wanted to be near her.</P><P>“I'll
tell you the story. I already finished it,” Naminè offered to the
redhead, looking over her shoulder, smiling her usual smile. It was
so easy for her to draw Kairi in, it was almost like a spell.
Whenever Kairi showed reluctance, Naminè looked at her with her
bright blue eyes, smiling like this, and instantly melted away any
shyness.</P><P>“Remember
that we haven't all day. I wanted to go and look for some music in
the shopping district,” Kairi reminded her girlfriend and sighed.</P><P>In
the end, they would have to run, for sure. Naminè was never a girl
of few words when it came to the stories she was reading. Especially
the ones from Lunaria Charon, an author Naminè seemed to favor over
anything else. And this was one of these works. Kairi could read her
name on the cover.</P><P>“Don't
worry. It's not very long,” Naminè reassured the girl right behind
her.</P><P>“You
really like the stories of that woman, don't you?” Kairi had never
heard of her before. She didn't read all that much, mostly works Leon
gave to her, and those were strategic lessons in a sense. The only
books outside of that were the works of Edward Rein Neel, who had
lived over a hundred years ago apparently. Many of his stories
described faraway places, still undiscovered by anyone but him. Kairi
favored his work because it was always thrilling to hear and read of
places where nobody had ever been before.</P><P>“Yeah.
Too bad that I could only find a few books from her.” With a
slightly depressed expression, Naminè sighed for a second and then
was back to happy again. “Now for the story.”</P><P>Kairi
leaned back, taking Naminè with her. As she lay down in the grass
and listened to Naminè telling the story of the Silver King, she
felt at peace. It was extremely rare for her to just forget all her
worries for even a second, but be it just Naminè or all of this
together, scenery, atmosphere and Naminè, it didn't matter. She felt
at peace, a first in a long long time.</P><P>“There
was once a man who was very poor. He lived in a kingdom where the
king was a tyrant, seizing women, money, and livestock wherever he
could, exploiting his people. He was a terrible king and many man
wished for him to die.</P><P>“One
day, the poor man found a golden piece, something very valuable, on
the ground. There was no one around. With that piece, he would be
able to buy back his house, his wife, maybe even a chicken or a cow.
But his consciousness dared him to find the person who lost the
golden coin.</P><P>“Being
a honest man, he looked and looked but couldn't find anyone that was
searching for the golden coin. After three days and three nights, he
was very hungry and weak. He finally meet another man, who had grown
very thin over the years, who looked at him in desperation. 'Have you
seen a golden coin? If so please, give it to me! It is all I have, it
is my treasure, the last thing that reminds me of my daughter and my
dead wife,' he pledged to him.</P><P>“He
was hungry, and not too far was an inn where he could eat and sleep
to his fill. But once again, he was a honest man, and gave the poor
old man his coin. The old man was so happy that he broke out in tears
and thanked the man on his knees. He soon left and the man was alone
yet again, hungry and without home or wife.</P><P>“He
had given away his own happiness for another, and seeing that good
deed, a fairy appeared before him. 'Your heart is pure and kind, I
shall award you with one wish,' the fairy said. The man pondered and
thought about it for a long time. 'I wish for the current ruler to
die,' he said, and the fairy looked disappointed at him and said,
'That I cannot do. We fairies cannot take the life of a man,' she
explained.</P><P>“The
man begged on his knees. The land was bleeding under his rule, he
told her, but she still refused. 'Is there no way to free the land of
this tyrant, this evil?' the man asked. The fairy thought about it
and came up with an idea, having pity for the poor people and the
honest man. 'This is a magical coin,' she said, and handed the man a
coin of silver. 'Only those who are pure of heart can hold it. Those
with evil in their heart shall become what they like the most,' she
said. 'Give it to the king.'</P><P>“The
fairy vanished and the man was left with a single silver coin. It was
a wonderful work of art, and it was shiny and blinking even in the
night. The man soon came before the king, seeking an audience. 'My
lord, I have brought a gift for you,' he told the king. 'It is this
coin of pure silver, worked by the fairies.' He held out his hand,
and as a guard was about to take it, he closed his fist. 'Only the
king is great enough a person to touch this coin. All that are not of
supreme greatness shall turn to stone upon touching it.'</P><P>“The
king was flattered, and his arrogance made him stand up and walk to
the man, attempting to grab the coin. The moment the coin was
touched, the king knew that this man wanted to kill him. But it was
too late for the king. The King's hand slowly turned to silver, the
magical coin turning the king himself into silver. The honest man was
struck dead by the guards upon command of the angry king, but the
king too, soon, stopped breathing. His greed and his evil character
had taken its toll. And so he became famous as the silver king, whose
reign of terror was ended by just a single man's honesty.”</P><P>Kairi
had long fallen asleep. Naminè had said she would not make it many
words, but halfway through the story, Kairi had fallen asleep. Lying
in the green grass, Naminè right next to her happily telling her the
story of the silver king, Kairi was in a state of real happiness.</P><P>“You're
a terrible audience, Kairi.” Naminè turned around, closely
watching the sleeping girl. Leaning over her, strands of hair started
to touch and tickle Kairi's face, slowly waking her up. Naminè had
planned to give her a kiss, but the redhead was moving around too
much, trying to escape the playful teasing of the girl above her.</P><P>“Oh
jeez, stop it, I'm awake already…” Kairi finally gave in and
moaned, slightly annoyed.</P><P>“That's
what you get for falling asleep on me.” Naminè put her hands on
Kairi's shoulders, pushing her back on the ground, on to the soft
grass. Kneeling above Kairi, Naminè started to tickle her
girlfriend, until her laughter was heard even on the foot of the
small hill they were on.</P><P>“Stop
it, stop it.” Kairi was trying to escape, but it was impossible.
She could barely talk, let alone try to free herself, even though she
had the obvious advantage in strength. Wheezing for air, holding her
sides, Kairi was finally let off the hook.</P><P>“I
thought you'd kill me,” Kairi complained, and flipped her middle
finger on Naminè's forehead. “Is this how you treat the girl you
like?”</P><P>And
with a giggling sound, rubbing the exact spot Kairi had hit, Naminè
answered with a simple, “Yeah. She deserves it.”</P><P>Things
were going smoothly between the two. They grew closer each day, each
hour they spent together. It was nice to have nothing to think about
except what to do next, how to enjoy the day. It was a beautiful
feeling to harbor, and Kairi was thankful that the wall that had
confined her feelings was finally gone.</P><P>“I'll
go and get a new book. Want to come with me?” Naminè asked and
stood up.</P><P>“Yeah.
I'll start to rust if I sit around too much.” Kairi stood up and
walked to where the blond girl was waiting for her. It always amazed
Kairi how different they were. Naminé was always cheerful, positive,
nice. Never reluctant to say what was on her mind. She was so
different from Kairi, yet, they complimented each other so nicely.</P><P>First
walking together, simply side by side, they made their way to the
castle. Halfway, Naminè pulled closer, took Kairi's hand, and waited
for a response. It was still a bit difficult. Sometimes, Kairi pulled
away, the contact being too much, sometimes it was just fine. Naminè
took another step, let go of the hand and took her arm. It was a bit
awkward to walk like that, since they were both about the same size,
but Kairi didn't mind.</P><P>“We're
never gonna make it to the library like this,” Kairi complained.</P><P>Naminè
didn't answer but kept clinging to Kairi. If she had to choose
between doing something else and being with Kairi, then she would
always pick Kairi, no matter what. And it wasn't that bad. They were
slower than normal, but Naminè really enjoyed walking like this.</P><P>“While
we're here, want to go to that place?” Naminè asked casually while
they were making their way through the entrance hall of the castle.</P><P>“I'd
rather go back to the tree. It'll be time for dinner soon and by the
time we get up there we'll have to come down right away. But we can
go tomorrow if you want to.” Kairi turned her down and offered
compensation to make it up to her.</P><P>Naminè
nodded, satisfied with this turn of events, and they finally made it
to the library. It was already late; the sun was setting, and if they
didn't hurry, they would be late for dinner. Tifa, that glutton,
would leave nothing for them.</P><P>“Pick
one fast, please. I don't want Tifa to eat my and your dinner as
well. And that's gonna happen if we get back late.”</P><P>The
thought first seemed a bit funny to Naminè, but the idea of eating
bread for dinner wasn't that funny on second thought. She vanished
upstairs, while Kairi waited at the door. A few minutes later, Naminè
came back, holding a ridiculously big, dusty book.</P><P>“Where
in the world did you get that? It looks ancient. At best.” Kairi
added, “But tell me that later, we've gotta run.” Taking her
hand, Kairi started to run, pulling Naminè with her. They had less
than ten minutes to get back before Tifa would savage their food.
Aerith would scold them as well for coming back late. Those two had
been a bit on edge lately, what with the new pub having problems on
every corner, and Kairi didn't want to make it any worse.</P><P>Wheezing
and out of breath, they made it barely in time. Aerith was still
cooking and Tifa was lying on the couch, listening to some of her
music on her headphones.</P><P>“Go
and wash your hands…and faces. Kairi, you have lip gloss on your
cheek.” Aerith grinned and turned around, her attention on the
food.</P><P>Kairi
blushed and started to rub her cheek, slightly embarrassed. It was no
mystery, at least not to Tifa and Aerith, that Kairi and Naminè were
going out. Looking at Naminè's puzzled face, she looked at her lips.
Naminè wasn't wearing any makeup, never did.</P><P>“You're
a terrible tease, Aerith,” Kairi moaned, and vanished upstairs to
change. Naminè's dress was mostly clean so she didn't need to change
and instead washed her hands in the kitchen.</P><P>“You
shouldn't do that to her. She's really easy to embarrass.” Naminé
said, but she couldn't help but giggle when she thought of how funny
Kairi looked when she was embarrassed.</P><P>“She
knows I'm just doing it to tease her. I'm happy that she finally
opened up this much. Can you hand me the potatoes?” Naminè reached
out and handed over the pot with the potatoes. Aerith was making
stew.</P><P>Kairi
came down when Naminè was still chatting with Aerith, so she picked
up a book she was supposed to read. It was one of the many works Leon
had made her read and this one was especially difficult because it
was so old. <I>Of Battle and War</I> was a book written by a
Keyblader from long-forgotten times. Only the initials on the cover
were readable, and they said E.L., which could mean about anything.
She hadn't even finished the first part of it—she
just didn't feel like wasting her time on this book when she could be
spending the same time with Naminè.</P><P>“Kairi?
Can you call—I mean, get
Tifa? I have my hands full here,” Aerith asked and proceeded to
carry the large pot with stew over to the table. Naminè was helping
with the dishes. Kairi closed her book. She had just started on a
chapter that handled battles against enemies one could not beat with
raw force. It said that often, tricking the enemy was much easier
than taking it down by force. Of course Kairi knew that, but this
book was going really in depth with it.</P><P>Walking
over to the couch, Kairi pulled Tifa's headphones from her head and
immediately jumped back. Tifa was known for her sudden reactions when
something unexpected happened right next to her. With her eyes
closed, she hadn't seen or heard Kairi coming, and if not for Kairi's
experience, she would've been hit by Tifa's fist.</P><P>“Dinner
is ready,” Kairi said, and walked back to the table, throwing the
headphones to Tifa.</P><P>“I'm
coming right away,” the black-haired woman said. She was exhausted.
The pub demanded more of her time than she had thought. But it was no
wonder. Hollow Bastion wasn't as small and poor as the slums in
sector seven. Thank God she had Aerith by her side to help her out.</P><P>Aerith
was chattering with Naminè, and Tifa was talking about work, how
bothersome some customers were and whatnot. Kairi listened to both,
one at a time, not too interested in what Tifa was talking about, and
not understanding some of what Aerith was talking about with Naminè.
Something about higher magic, nothing to do with her. Finishing her
food, Kairi picked up the book she was reading. It was Naminè's turn
to help out in the kitchen today, and she really had to finish this
piece sometime soon. Leon had given it to her over two weeks ago.</P><P>“What
are you reading?” Naminè had been released from the kitchen and
was standing right behind Kairi, who was still sitting at the table.
She leaned forward, laying her arms around Kairi's shoulders, looking
at the book.</P><P>Putting
a finger on the line she was on, looking to the side, Kairi answered
faithfully, “A book Leon gave me. It's giving me a headache.” She
sighed and closed the book. Page eighty-seven. Still over two hundred
to go.</P><P>“Want
to go to my room?” Kairi asked, thoughtful not to let Tifa hear it.
She would make fun of her.</P><P>With
a happy smile, Naminè nodded and let go of her girlfriend, going
upstairs. Kairi waited a moment, then walked past Aerith, following
Naminè.</P><P>“Keep
the blanket clean!” Tifa shouted, and Kairi immediately blushed
until she was as red as a tomato.</P><P>“That's
none of your business!” Kairi shouted back and vanished upstairs.</P><P>“What
did Tifa mean?” Naminè asked when Kairi entered her own room.</P><P>Unable
to answer that, she just waved her hand and said, “Nothing, it's
nothing, forget it…” a few times, choking on embarrassment.
Always that Tifa! Kairi hadn't spent a single thought on…that.</P><P>“Come
on, tell me,” Naminè nagged, and sat down on Kairi's bed.</P><P>“Some
other time.” Kairi turned her down and made clear that she would
not tell, no matter how much Naminé asked.</P><P>“Fine
then. Stingy.” Naminè made a sulking expression, swinging her legs
on the bed back and forth, slightly annoyed that Kairi was holding
back. It was probably something embarrassing, so she didn't want to
talk about it, and Naminè dropped the issue.</P><P>Kairi
picked up a water bottle she always kept in her room, and took a
large gulp. “Can I sleep here tonight?” Naminè blurted out,
making Kairi almost spit the water out as she choked on it. In the
midst of coughing, Kairi managed to calm down.</P><P>“What
did you say?” Kairi wasn't sure she hadn't misheard.</P><P>“I
want to sleep in the same bed as you. Olette is gone, and it's lonely
to sleep in that room alone.” Naminè had a point. When the
training was still going on, they were too tired to even notice that
it was lonely at times, but now that they had time, it was different.
Kairi was in a pinch. How would she handle that? Sleeping in the same
bed as Naminè seemed a bit over the top for now. Turning her down
would seem a bit cold and distant.</P><P>“Okay,
but…no sneaking up on me at night.” Kairi sighed. Hopefully
Naminè would keep to that rule.</P><P>“Should
I tell Aerith?” Naminè already knew the answer to that one but it
was always fun seeing Kairi get flustered.</P><P>“No, don't. Just
come over the roof. I'll leave the window open.” Aerith was still
pretty strict when it came to such things. Kairi didn't knew why, but
it was better not to anger her.</P><P>“I'll
go take a shower. If you peek, you can sleep in your own room!”
Kairi warned the girl that was already making herself comfortable on
her bed. “Absolutely no searching my drawers either. I'm warning
you.” Kairi sighed and left her room, leaving Naminè alone.</P><P>“Stingy.”
Naminè stuck her tongue out at the closed door and turned around,
lying on her stomach, face buried in Kairi's pillow. “Mm, Kairi's
scent…”</P><P>The
hot water flowed down from her body, taking the bit of fatigue she
had carried over from last week with it. Even hotter than the water
was her face. Sleeping in the same bed as quite the jump ahead. Well,
as long Naminè didn't do anything outrageous it would be all fine.</P><P>Still,
Kairi was excited and nervous. How should she act? Just be herself?
She hadn't exchanged as much as a kiss ever since their training had
started, but now that was done and dealt with. Now that she thought
about it, was Naminè maybe thinking she was being cold for not even
trying to kiss her today? Or did she not mind at all? The thoughts of
that girl were sometimes just a big mystery to Kairi. Taking some
shampoo, Kairi rubbed her legs together. With a sigh, she picked up
the razor.</P><P>Naminè
was still on the bed, just as she was when Kairi left. The thought of
sleeping in the same bed as Kairi was exciting, but she really had to
watch out not to do something stupid. Kairi was still sensitive to
such things, and if she went too far, it could ruin everything. Maybe
just sharing the same blanket, sharing the same space to sleep was
enough for today. After all, that was much more than she had ever had
of Kairi. If Kairi tried to kiss her, Naminè wouldn't hesitate to
respond.</P><P>She
was a little worried about Olette and how she was doing, but if she
was with Yuffie, she was probably fine. Except that Yuffie was a
horrible tease, though. But Olette probably had learned to deal with
that by now.</P><P>Moving
up, Naminè noticed that she had drooled on Kairi's pillow. “Oops…I
better not tell her.” Turning the pillow around, Naminè would
pretend she knew nothing about it. But Kairi smelled really nice. If
she had to describe it, she would say it resembled ripe strawberries.</P><P>Kairi
was still in the shower. What was taking her so long? Looking around,
Naminè remembered her warning. No looking through her drawers. On
the table next to the bed was the Keychain for Oathkeeper. It was a
star, or something that closely resembled one. There was a little
case next to it. It looked like a jewel case. But Kairi never wore
any jewelry. What was in it?</P><P>Walking
to the door, checking that the water in the bathroom was still
running, Naminè went back in Kairi's room and opened the little
case.</P><P>In
it was another Keychain. A black crown. Naminè had never seen that
one before. Kairi never used it. But it seemed precious to her—why
else would she keep it like this?</P><P>Naminè
took out her own Keychain for Monochrome, a silver boat's wheel, and
looked at it. Naminè didn't know where Kairi got it form, but it fit
her nicely. It was probably better Naminè didn't ask about this. If
she hid it away like this, it was better she didn't tell her she
found it. Falling back on the bed, Naminè was bored. The Keychain in
that little case still occupied her thoughts. Should she try to use
it? Better not. Who knew what would happen.</P><P>“Already
asleep?” Kairi walked in, a towel over her head, still drying her
damp hair. She looked down at Naminè, who was lying on the bed with
her eyes fixated on Kairi. She threw the wet towel on Naminè's face.</P><P>“You're
not sleeping in my bed without taking a shower first. It's already
dark out. Get moving,” Kairi ordered her. She wanted to be alone
for a moment. Usually, she just slept in a long shirt, but that would
be rather careless today. Now she would have to look through her own
drawers. Thinking about it, Kairi was really lacking in the nice
clothes department. Most of her things were practical, things that
promoted agility and evasion.</P><P>Naminè
picked up the towel and walked to the door. “You look so cute when
you're flustered.” And before Kairi could throw her pillow, Naminè
left, giggling and smiling on her way to the bathroom. When she
opened the door, a massive wall of mist came right at her. How long
had Kairi been in there? The windows were filmed over with damp and
the floor was wet. Amazed by the chaos, Naminè closed the door and
started undressing.</P><P>“Naminè?
Can I come in? I think I forgot something.” Kairi knocked on the
door, impatiently waiting for a reply. She had completely forgotten
to take her clothes with her. And Kairi really didn't want to walk in
on Naminè again, on the same day no less. Remembering the incident,
she blushed. Naminè was an amazingly cute girl. Much more than she
had thought. Those dresses she always wore really concealed her nice
figure.</P><P>“If
it's your clothes, I can just take them with me when I get out.
Unless you want to see me naked again, that is.” Naminè giggled.
She knew how embarrassed Kairi was about it even though she didn't
really mind. What was so embarrassing about seeing each other naked
anyway?</P><P>“Uhm,
I'd rather get them myself. Can't you wear a towel or something?”
Kairi didn't want someone else to touch her underwear, even if it was
Naminè. Much less used underwear.</P><P>“Only
under one condition.” Naminè saw a good opportunity to extend the
spoils from before. “Let me sleep in your bed until Olette comes
back. And no you sleeping elsewhere. I want us two to share a bed,”
Naminè demanded and waited curiously for a reply.</P><P>“Okay,
you win. But let me get my clothes now.” Kairi grew more impatient
with each second. Naminè really took after Aerith, and that wasn't
something good. She was shamelessly abusing this situation. But it
wasn't really that bad of a thing. It was just her sleeping in the
same bed.</P><P>The
lock clicked and the door opened a little gap. Naminé had wrapped
herself in a towel, her own clothes on the ground in the back of the
bathroom. “Can't have you nosebleed seeing me naked,” the blond
girl teased the other.</P><P>“What
am I, an old man?” Kairi blushed and averted her eyes. Trying not
to look at Naminè at all, Kairi picked up her things and left, not
without unintentionally giving Naminè a good look close-up. It
brought up some hot memories from the morning and Kairi left in a
hurry.</P><P>Naminè
smiled to herself after Kairi left and locked the door again.
Finishing undressing herself, she picked up her clothes and put them
on the edge of the bathtub. Holding up a pair of black panties,
Naminè almost started laughing. Kairi would absolutely panic if she
knew she had forgotten these. Seconds later, the noise of the shower,
of water flowing down Naminé's slender body, filled the room.</P><P>It
was past nine in the evening and Kairi was sort of tired. She was
startled when the door opened and Tifa knocked on the frame.</P><P>“Kairi?
I'm going out with Aerith for a while. Thought I'd let you know.”
Tifa was wearing a black summer dress that looked really nice on her.
The sandals didn't fit at all with it, but the black-clad woman had
quite a weird sense of fashion anyway. Kairi was kinda curious as to
what Aerith was wearing, but she was too lazy to get up.</P><P>“See
you tomorrow. I'm going to sleep soon, I'm tired.” Kairi waved with
her hand to signal that she understood that the two women would be
gone for some time. It wasn't unusual for them to go out for walk at
this hour. Hollow Bastion had become quite safe lately. It was like
the Heartless were giving up on taking the Keyblade and the town.</P><P>Tifa
had already left when Kairi looked up. Seconds later, the house door
fell closed and Kairi could hear Aerith talking from her open window.
She couldn't make out what they were talking about, but it seemed
like their usual flirting. Would she become like that with Naminè
one day? Blushing at the thought, she let herself fall back on her
bed, burying her face in the pillow. Would their relationship go that
far?</P><P>“Are
you already asleep?” Naminè walked in the room, a towel on her
head, wearing a long shirt she had probably taken from Kairi's
drawers earlier. Her hair still wet, with tiny drops falling towards
the ground continuously. Holding her old clothes in one hand, Naminè
walked over to the basket for laundry, filling it even more.</P><P>“I'll
put your panties in there. They were mixed in with my clothes.”
Naminè scratched her cheek with her index finger, sighing when Kairi
still didn't respond. Was she really sleeping? She dried her hair a
bit more, and when she leaned over Kairi, a drop of cold water landed
on Kairi's neck, causing her to jump up, appalled.</P><P>Kairi
needed a few seconds to know what was going on. Naminè was looking
at her, amused and giggling.</P><P>“Don't
scare me like that!” Kairi complained, and pulled on the towel on
her head, causing it to slip over Naminè's face. “Dry your hair,
you're getting my bed all wet. And me too, on top of that!”</P><P>Kairi
moved down from her bed and started to look through her drawers.
Aerith had given her a large wooden comb as a present quite some time
ago, but she usually didn't bother to use it. Naminè looked a bit
like a exploded mop, though. When she was looking through her
drawers, she remembered that she didn't want to sleep in just a
shirt. But changing now was kinda…</P><P>“Ahh,
that felt good.” Naminè pulled down the towel and hung it over a
chair next to the table near the window. “What are you looking for,
Kairi? You can stay like that, teehee~” Naminè tried to say it in
a seductive tone, but it came out really weirdly and Kairi started
giggling uncontrollably after giving her a weird look.</P><P>“Meanie.”
Naminè looked away and made herself comfortable on the bed.</P><P>Kairi
finally found the comb and proceed to walk over to Naminè, who was
happily snuggling with her blanket. With a slightly awkward
expression, Kairi pulled Naminè up, positioning herself behind her.
“Come on, I'll comb your hair. Otherwise you'll look like a mess
tomorrow.” And without further ado, Kairi started. Naminè didn't
protest or moan, but was silent. It was a nice feeling, though.
Caring for each other like that was something Kairi didn't experience
every day.</P><P>“I
never thought you would be the caring type, Kairi,” Naminè said
after a few minutes of silent combing had passed. Kairi couldn't see
it but Naminè was smiling, enjoying this situation. She had longed
so much for Kairi to be with her that it felt very satisfying to
finally get what she wanted so badly.</P><P>“I'm
the caring type?” Kairi was a little bit embarrassed and puzzled
over that. Was she, really? But if that made Naminè happy, then it
was a good thing.</P><P>Finishing
with a few strokes, Kairi sat back and looked at it from different
angles. Naminè's hair was still a bit damp and easy to comb, but it
smelled nice and with the light and the water, it looked a bit like
it was shining. “There, all done. You look much better now. But you
should pay more attention to your hair in the future.”</P><P>Leaning
back without warning, Naminè looked straight up into Kairi's face.
Without words, her intentions were quite clear to the redhead. Slowly
reaching out with one hand, touching Kairi's cheek, Naminè wanted
Kairi to lean down. Naminè's wet hair tickled Kairi's legs. She was
sitting cross-legged on her bed, Naminè's head resting on them.
Their blue eyes met in the middle, two glares becoming one.</P><P>Slowly,
Kairi followed Naminè's lead, leaning forward until she could feel
the breath of the excited girl below her. Reaching out, laying both
her arms around Kairi's neck, the blond girl pulled her closer and
closer until only an instant was between them.</P><P>Kairi
could feel Naminè moving up slightly. She wanted it too, wanted to
feel her lips again on her own, wanted to share the same embrace they
had shared not so long ago. Skin touched, and as Kairi closed her
eyes, she could feel the warm lips of the girl she had come to like.
It was just like that moment that seemed so far away now. A stream of
feelings rushed to her head, letting her forget all about her
reservations, and she gave in to the kiss, gave in to Naminè.</P><P>How
much time passed, neither knew when they finally separated. They kept
close, just like they were before the kiss. Naminè smiled and Kairi
could not only see but feel that it was because Naminè was madly in
love with her. Pulling Kairi closer, Naminè whispered something in
her ear. Kairi didn't need to be told, she knew, since a long time.
Naminè loved her, but to actually hear her say it was an amazing
feeling. It was like something opened up in Kairi, like she was able
to cross a bridge that she had not dared to look at for ages.</P><P>“I
love you too…” Kairi whispered back.</P><P>Naminè
was speechless. She hadn't expected Kairi to reply, hadn't expected
her to say it. But Kairi had, and it was making Naminè unimaginably
happy. She hadn't misheard, she hadn't forced it out. Kairi had
wanted to say it and she just knew that it was a serious response.
Both of them seemed suspended in time, staring at each other,
surprised and happy. The towel slipped from the chair and fell to the
ground, the sound calling them back to reality.</P><P>“I
wanted to hear that so much…” Naminè caressed Kairi's cheek with
her smooth and slender fingers, smiling even more than before, with a
special glimmer in her eyes. It was like they were now the first time
truly together. Kairi kept silent, eyes closed, enjoying what Naminè
did to her. Her heart was beating fast, her mind fuzzy and in chaos.
She hated it, usually, to be like that, but it felt just right for
now.</P><P>Cold
air came in from the window, and Kairi suddenly got goosebumps,
ripping the illusionary world she was in abruptly apart. With a look
that could only described with “forgive me,” Kairi got up,
leaving the embrace, leaving the little world they had entered.</P><P>It
had gotten cold and it was dark. Naminè would sleep in this room
tonight, and Kairi was really looking forward to it. Closing the
window and turning off the lights, Kairi moved back to her bed. She
couldn't see in the darkness, but knew exactly where she had to stop.
Naminè had long crawled under the blanket, waiting for Kairi to join
her.</P><P>“I'm
so nervous, I wonder why…” Naminè whispered. It was impossible
to tell, but Naminè was actually blushing and averting her eyes when
Kairi finally lay down next to her. Searching for her hand, Naminè
intertwined her fingers with Kairi's, holding hands under the
blanket. Moving closer, bit by bit, Naminè soon could feel the very
warmth of Kairi's body, their faces only a bit apart. Naminè's heart
skipped when Kairi moved in, kissing her. Snuggled together, they
caressed each other's faces until they finally fell asleep, still
holding hands.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Tifa
was still rubbing her head. She had dragged Aerith out for no reason,
and now Aerith finally knew why. That brute wanted to spy on Kairi
and Naminè.</P><P>“You
should be ashamed of yourself, Tifa Lockhart!” Aerith was still
complaining. Tifa had excused herself for a moment, and when she
hadn't come back after a few minutes, Aerith had a hunch. The sudden
choice to go out and then, just going off like that…there had to be
something going on.</P><P>And
Aerith had been right. It was no special trick to guess where she
would be. Tifa was lurking right next to the window, hidden in the
shadows, when Aerith found her. With a hit on the head and a glare
that could kill, Aerith dragged Tifa away.</P><P>“Okay,
I got it, I got it! No more spying on the girls. Jeez, you really are
a party pooper, Aerith,” Tifa complained, walking to a wall and
sitting down. “It's not like I wanted to peep on them, I just
wanted to know how things were going.” Tifa averted her eyes and
didn't dare to look at Aerith. She could be really angry when it was
about things like private space.</P><P>“It's
not like I saw anything. Naminè still wasn't out of the shower, and
Kairi was just sleeping.” Tifa tried to defend herself, more in
vain than in success.</P><P>“Just
let them be. I think it was hard enough for Kairi to finally get
there…” Aerith slowly calmed down and walked over to Tifa,
sitting down on a higher fragment of the wall. “I'm happy that
Kairi finally found someone she can open her heart to.” Giving Tifa
a warning glare, Aerith added, “And I don't want anyone to ruin
that. I want Kairi to be happy.”</P><P>Tifa
sighed, and knew she would not win this argument if she kept on
defending herself. All that was left was saying sorry and hoping that
Aerith was forgiving. “You're right, my bad. I'm sorry. I wonder
how Olette is doing. Yuffie can be a real pain in the neck
sometimes.” Tifa sighed.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>The
sun was already high in the sky when Kairi finally woke up to the
warm rays of light. Looking around, it took her a moment to grasp her
surroundings. Something was on her arm. When she looked at it, it was
Naminè, clinging to her. The last night slowly came back to her and
Kairi blushed quite a bit.</P><P>Trying
to calm down, she freed herself from Naminè, got up, and opened the
window. Fresh air streaming in the room caused Kairi to shiver for a
second. She looked back at the bed. Naminè was still refusing to
wake up.</P><P>Kneeling
on the bed, Kairi rubbed Naminè's cheek, trying to wake her up.
“Come on, it's already noon. Wake up, sleepyhead.” Kairi teased
the blond girl a bit more until she gave up. If she wanted to sleep,
so be it. They had nothing to do anyway, except getting yelled at for
sleeping that long.</P><P>Kairi
didn't want to leave until Naminè woke up, so she picked up the book
from the day before and started reading. Where had she stopped? Page
eighty? Something like that. Finding the exact point after a few
minutes, Kairi soon lost her concentration. Next to her was still
Naminè, sound asleep, and looking incredibly cute. Kairi resisted
the temptation to kiss her awake and indulged herself further in the
book.</P><P>Roughly
thirty pages later, and with a big yawn, Naminè woke up. The eyes
only half-open, she crawled around in the bed, and having spotted
Kairi, immediately clung to her, forcing her attention on herself.
“Morning…” Naminè yawned again and took her time fully waking
up. “I'm hungry…” Kairi had to laugh and patted her on the
head.</P><P>“Get
up. It's already noon.” Kairi smiled and pushed Naminè away,
finally getting up herself. She picked out some clothes for the day,
intent on going to the bathroom. “I'll bring some clothes over.”
Kairi left the room and sighed. When she entered the bathroom, Tifa
was standing in front of the mirror, brushing her teeth.</P><P>“You
two are really slacking off lately,” Tifa complained while Kairi
waited quite impatiently for her to finish so that she could change.
“Why are you changing in the bathroom?” Tifa asked, trying to be
as natural as possible. She knew that Naminè was most likely still
in Kairi's room and that the redhead didn't want to change in front
of her.</P><P>“Wanted
to wash my face,” Kairi lied and averted her eyes. She didn't want
to explain herself or the situation. “Can you hurry up? And why are
you brushing your teeth around this time? Don't tell me you just got
up.” Now that she looked more closely, Tifa was still dressed
casually, not for work.</P><P>“I'm
off from work today. Aerith too.” Tifa answered faithfully and
turned around, the toothbrush loose in her mouth, waving with her
hands. “I'm gonna close the pub on weekends from now on. It's a
pain to work on the weekends, so I'm not gonna do it.” And with a
sigh, she turned around, finishing up brushing her teeth.</P><P>Kairi
didn't want to distract her any longer because she wanted to change
already. The bathroom door was still open and she was sitting there,
in just the shirt she had worn for sleep, with her clothes on her
lap. It certainly looked odd for anyone passing by. Had Naminè
changed already? Or had that sleepyhead gone back to sleep? If so,
Kairi would throw her out of the bed. She usually woke up at her own
time and she didn't like oversleeping.</P><P>“Kairi?
Are you done changing yet?” Naminè looked inside the bathroom,
from the floor, her head poking around the corner. “Oh, morning,
Tifa.” Awkward silence had the room in its iron grip. After a few
seconds, Tifa started laughing, then coughing because of the water in
her mouth, then laughing again.</P><P>“Did
Cid test one of his inventions on you? You look rough.” Pointing at
Naminè's hair, that looked really rough and rumpled, Tifa was hold
her side. She broke out in laughter again as Naminè pulled a strand
of her hair with a puzzled expression. “Why are you wearing Kairi's
clothes, by the way?” Tifa asked with a mean, knowing glare.</P><P>“Her
clothes are all in the laundry.” Kairi jumped in and tried to avert
the disaster. “That's why I allowed her to wear some of mine.
Aren't you done soon, or are you trying to reach a new record for the
longest teeth brushing in history?”</P><P>Tifa
was so amused by Kairi's impatience that she wanted to tease her some
more. “How come it's my turn to do the laundry, but I haven't see
any of Naminè's clothes?” It was an obvious lie. It was Tifa's
turn, all right, but Kairi knew that there had to be some of Naminè's
clothes in the basket. She had watched her drop them in there
yesterday.</P><P>Aerith
joined the crowd. “Tifa, are you still not done? We were supposed
to leave an hour ago! I wanted to look for some new clothes at
Stilzkin's.” Looking at the other two girls, Aerith showed her
usual smile. “Morning, Kairi, morning, Naminè.” She noticed
immediately that Naminè was wearing Kairi's clothes, and that Kairi
was apparently quite annoyed with Tifa delaying her leave so long.</P><P>“If
you aren't done in five minutes, I'm leaving without you,” Aerith
proclaimed, and left for downstairs.</P><P>“Tsk…see
you two later.” Tifa cursed a few times quietly enough so that
Aerith couldn't hear her and finally left the bathroom. Naminè was
still standing in the entrance of the room, looking at Kairi,
apparently waiting for her to do something. Did she want to watch her
change? With a sudden blush, Kairi stood up and shoved Naminè out of
the room.</P><P>“No
peeking,” Kairi said, and locked the door. Finally alone, she
pulled her shirt off and started to dress. A short black skirt (Kairi
had lately taken a liking to darker colors), and a sleeveless top in
dark red. She really needed some new shoes.</P><P>When
Kairi unlocked the door, Naminè was gone. Probably in Kairi's room,
reading. When the redhead got there, there was no sign of Naminè.
Where had she gone?</P><P>“Naminè?”
Kairi called. Tifa and Aerith had most likely already left, so there
was no one to hear her shouting.</P><P>“Hm?”
Naminè came out of her room, carrying a sketchbook and two pens, one
for dark lines and one for lighter ones. Kairi only now noticed that
Naminè was wearing one of her favorite dresses, the pink one-piece,
but she had forgotten to wear an undershirt. If one were tall enough,
he could stare right at her cleavage. Her white sandals didn't fit
one bit, but Kairi didn't say anything. It looked rather good on her,
but it was an odd feeling to see that dress on someone else.</P><P>“You
want to draw something?” Kairi asked.</P><P>“You.
I want to draw you. Will you model for me Kairi?” Naminè blurted
out and showed her usual smile. That was just like Naminè, honest
and bold, paired with a bit of naiveté.
But Kairi liked that part of her. She always spent a lot of time
thinking what she should say and more often than not, she didn't say
what she wanted to say. Naminè was different.</P><P>“Me?”
Kairi was a bit embarrassed about modeling for Naminè. True, she had
gotten a lot better lately, but wasn't drawing a portrait really
difficult? But to say no would mean to let Naminè down. How bad
could it turn out?</P><P>“Why
not? Where do you want to draw? I guess the light outside is better,”
Kairi agreed and thought about what pose she should take.</P><P>“The
tree from yesterday. I want to draw you in front of that old huge
tree. I really like being there. It's <I>our place</I>.” Naminè
smiled happily and walked once around Kairi, looking at her. “Can
you take Oathkeeper with you? I want you to hold it when I draw you.”
Besides that, Naminè was satisfied with her outfit. It wasn't what
Kairi wore when they first met, but it was nice and rare enough to
see Kairi in a skirt.</P><P>Kairi
just nodded and followed the artist's request, taking the pendant
from the table next to her bed and going back to the girl who had
already gone downstairs. She was waiting at the open door, where the
warm sunshine welcomed them to the day now that they were finally and
truly awake. Even though it was past noon, the sun was still high up.
It really was about to be summer. It was hot ,and Kairi was thankful
that she had worn a skirt. Trousers would be really uncomfortable in
this heat.</P><P>As
they made their way to the tree, holding hands and walking close
together, Naminè discussed a few details of the drawing with Kairi.
How she should stand, how she should hold Oathkeeper, and where she
should look. Kairi rolled her eyes at all the things she had to
remember, but for Naminè's sake, she paid attention. When they
finally arrived, Naminè wandered about for a few minutes to find a
spot with good light and where she could also see the lowest branches
of the majestic tree.</P><P>“This
is good. Kairi?” Naminè asked her model to take position. Leaning
on the trunk, holding Oathkeeper only loosely in her hand and with
the expression of a dreamer, Kairi looked slightly toward the sky
beyond the branches. It wasn't a difficult pose, but she had to
stand, and she wasn't allowed to move at all.</P><P>“I'm
starting now. I will draw your face last so you can talk. I'd be
lonely with you being silent all the time,” Naminè said, and
showed a glimpse of red shimmer on her face.</P><P>“How
come you suddenly want to draw me?” Kairi asked, unmoving,
maintaining her pose. It wasn't like Naminè hadn't had the chance to
ask her to draw her, but she never asked. Had she asked now because
of last night? They had only kissed, slept together in the same bed.
And Kairi had finally told Naminè that she loved her. Was that the
reason? Had Naminè waited until she would hear those three magical
words?</P><P>“Last
night made me understand that some things change with time. I want to
remember you as you are now, even if you change in the future. I
always want to have a piece, a picture, a keepsake of the Kairi who
told me she loves me,” Naminè answered, being completely truthful.
She didn't want to make any excuses, didn't want to leave any
uncertainty. “I love you, so I want to draw you.”</P><P>Kairi
had to fight with herself not to look away. She closed her eyes, her
face a fierce red. She hadn't thought a second that this would change
a anything. She really had meant it, she really loved Naminè. But
there was more to it. Something she just couldn't explain. Something
that was not love but also just as important…</P><P>“Say,
Naminè…do you remember anything before you…were captured?” Now
that Kairi thought about the future, the past was catching up. She
didn't know anything about Naminè's origins. Where she came from,
who she was. If she had family, if she had friends, if her world
still existed. Back when she arrived she had said she didn't remember
anything and they had thought her memory would come back. But Naminè
never mentioned anything. There couldn't be people without any
memories…right?</P><P>“No.
When I first opened my eyes I was in what Leon calls the headquarters
of the Nobodies. I don't know how I got there, or what I was doing
there. They asked me many things, and I still don't understand most
of them. I…don't want to think about that time too much.” Naminé
stopped for a second, as if deep in thought. “What…about your
past? You never talk about that. I want to know more about you,
understand you.” Naminè looked over her sketchbook and kept her
gaze on Kairi.</P><P>“My
past is…probably even worse than yours. Do you remember? The time I
first found you, in that castle, in that tower. It was like I was
being called by you, like you could see my mind, speak to me through
it. Did I imagine that? Did it really happen?” Kairi took a deep
breath. There were so many mysterious things about Naminè. So much
they—<I>she</I>—didn't
know.</P><P>“You
didn't imagine that. I felt it too. I could feel your determination
but also your fear, your insecurity about your mission. I could feel
that you wanted to save someone and I thought it was me. That's why I
called out to you. It happened. But I don't know how…I only could
feel your thoughts, your heart when I was in that tower. I can't
right now,” Naminè answered, and got back to her sketch. She had
the legs done and was now drawing Kairi's hips. It was more difficult
than she had imagined but she could do it.</P><P>“I
wonder what that was. It didn't feel like my thoughts were being
invaded…more like shared. I don't remember too clearly.” Kairi
took another deep breath. Such heavy topics were not her specialty
and she didn't like talking about it. But her curiosity got the
better of her, most of the time. Especially if it dealt with Naminè
and her friends.</P><P>“About
your past…Aerith told me that you fought alone at the end. Against
'Ansem the Dark One'. Who was he?” Naminè wanted to know. Wanted
to know what happened to Kairi that she had shut herself away from
the world.</P><P>“He
was…evil. More evil than everything I ever saw. I…think I should
tell you. He manipulated me. Everyone. He was not human anymore. A
Heartless so powerful that you'd tremble at the sheer sight of it. He
planned to attain Kingdom Hearts, the heart of all worlds. I followed
him to the end of all worlds, where in the depths he waited. Waited
for me, knowing I had the only key that could open the Gate to
Kingdom Hearts. Or so we thought…” Kairi paused. It was like, by
the sole mention of his name, the air cooled down. Chills ran down
her spine.</P><P>“What
happened to him?” Naminè asked. She had completely forgotten about
drawing Kairi. She could feel the ominous presence coming from her.
Could virtually grasp the terror she had undergone. It was by no
account nice. Not human. Shivers shook Naminè when Kairi continued.</P><P>“At
the end, there was only a door. A point of no return. Beyond there
was only darkness. Pure darkness. And there, in the darkness beyond
blackest pitch, he was waiting for me. He promised me that I would
live eternally. Never get old, never get sick. Power, everything. It
seemed too good to be true. And it was.</P><P>“I
rejected his offer. Enraged, he attacked me. I had no chance. He was
like an almighty force, toying with the life of a insect. The pain
was unbearable. I almost lost my mind. He was so powerful…darkness
was engulfing me, devouring me. No light, not even the Keyblade could
protect me from it. I was on the verge of death when I heard the
voices of my friends, Sora and Riku. They told me to never give up.
That they were waiting for me.</P><P>“I
could feel Ansem's icy grip on my hand, trying to take the Kingdom
Key, the Keyblade he needed to open Kingdom Hearts. I don't know
how…I screamed and shouted, my body was breaking under the pain…but
I managed to pierce his chest with the Keyblade. From there on, it's
all a blur. I don't know if I passed out or what happened. When I
opened my eyes again, I was wounded but alive, right in front of
Kingdom Hearts.” Kairi ended her story looking pale and sick.</P><P>“Let's
take a break.” It was the only thing Naminè said. Dropping her
sketchbook, she walked up to Kairi who didn't look too good.
“I…understand why you don't want to talk about it. I'm afraid
just from hearing about it.”</P><P>Kairi
sat down and leaned back on the trunk. She felt a bit better with
Naminè next to her. But talking about all of this woke up her
memories. It had been beyond terrifying. She never wanted to
experience something like that again. Never.</P><P>The
next half hour passed without them speaking a word. Kairi slowly
regained her color and Naminè kept close to her. Hearing about
Ansem…it was like she knew what Kairi was talking about. Like she
herself had experienced it. Deep inside, fear held her heart in its
grip. Ansem was not like anything else. Naminé was afraid, afraid of
seeing Kairi suffer any more.</P><P>“I
feel much better now, thanks.” Kairi forced herself to smile and
patted Naminé's head. “I just…don't like to remember those
things. We can continue if you want. I'm okay now.” Kairi stood up,
knocking off the dirt from her skirt.</P><P>“Really?”
Naminè wasn't sure if Kairi was pretending or really feeling better.
But she was so stubborn that no matter what she said now, Kairi would
keep claiming that she was okay. Slowly walking back to her
sketchbook, Naminè picked it up and started drawing. Checking
secretly on Kairi every few lines, Naminè was soon sure that she
wasn't pretending. Kairi was a strong girl. She probably dealt with
it in her own way.</P><P>Naminè
continued drawing for almost two hours until she called it enough for
the day. It was for both, artist and model, equally difficult to
maintain their concentration, and they were hungry. Having skipped
breakfast, they hadn't eaten anything until now. The sun was still
clearly visible and it was hot, but around an hour after Naminè had
started drawing a slight wind had come up, bringing some refreshing
cool air with it.</P><P>“Want
to go and grab something to eat at Kupo's? I hear the Moogles there
make really good food. Nothing big, though, since I guess Aerith is
gonna make dinner in a few hours,” Kairi offered. Kupo's was not
just a restaurant. It was part of the big Stilzkin & Kupo chain
that had a lot of shops. Stilzkin was a Moogle that had traveled far
and wide and collected all sorts of treasures.</P><P>“Can
we stop by at home first? I don't want to carry my sketchbook with
me. The nice drawing would be ruined if someone dropped food or
drinks on it.”</P><P>Kairi
could see her point. It was on the way anyway. Maybe a detour of two
minutes at best. She also didn't want to carry Oathkeeper all the way
with her.</P><P>“Sure.
Let's go, I'm starving.” Kairi smiled, back to her happy self from
the morning. Naminè was a bit tired but couldn't help but smile and
cling to Kairi, walking arm in arm. “You really are a limpet, do
you know that?” Kairi teased the blond girl.</P><P>The
rest of their day was nothing special. Eating a few burgers at
Kupo's, they got home even before Tifa and Aerith. Kairi made herself
comfortable on the couch and relaxed a bit. Naminè sat in one of the
armchairs and pulled her sketchbook and started to draw without Kairi
knowing.</P><P>When
Tifa and Aerith came home (Aerith looking quite happy and
empty-handed, Tifa looking pissed and with four bags of clothes),
they noticed Kairi sleeping on the couch and Naminè sleeping in the
armchair, holding an half-finished sketch of Kairi sleeping.</P><P>“How
cute.” Aerith giggled, and with an sudden thud, Tifa dropped the
bags, dropping herself on a chair on the kitchen bar.</P><P>Waking
up from the sound, the other two girls bade them welcome home. Aerith
started to make dinner and had Naminè help out while Kairi, feeling
better, picked up her book she had left upstairs. Tifa was soon gone,
taking a shower as she was really exhausted. For the rest of the
evening, they could listen to Tifa complaining about what a shopping
maniac Aerith was and that fighting Heartless was no big deal in
comparison. Receiving giggling from the girls and a mad glare from
Aerith, the black-clad woman shut up and ate her dinner in silence.</P><P>The
rest of the evening was ordinary. Kairi read her book, Naminè made
yet another sketch of her lying on her bed, reading. Kairi didn't
mind. She had even come to like it and teased Naminè a bit with
changing her position just a little sometimes.</P><P>The
evening came, and Kairi got herself pretty excited. Naminè had
demanded that she could sleep for the whole weekend in her bed, but
by now, Kairi didn't even want it otherwise. She felt lonely without
Naminè around. Going to bed earlier than usual, Kairi and Naminè
spent a lot of time still awake.</P><P>They
held hands and stared at each other for minutes at a time. One gave
the other a playful kiss once in a while. They enjoyed the each
other's company to the fullest. It was long past midnight when they
finally fell asleep, snuggled together while holding hands, their
faces just inches apart.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>It
was pitch black out when they woke up. The sirens, all of them,
started to sound through the town. It was an alarm. Somewhere in
Hollow Bastion, the Heartless were attacking. But all sirens? That
was a big alarm. Everyone from the Committee and all Keybladers had
to assemble at the point that was signalized by a signal rocket in
such a case.</P><P>“Get
Monochrome. Tifa and Aerith should be awake. Just put on clothes from
yesterday!” Kairi ordered, instantly wide awake. Jumping out of her
bed, she grabbed the first clothes she could get—her
dress that Naminè had worn yesterday. Slipping in her sneakers and
grabbing Oathkeeper, Kairi stormed out the room. Tifa was already
waiting in the hall. Aerith apparently still dressing.</P><P>“Damn
these things. It's been so calm lately that we've let our guard
down,” Tifa cursed and stomped. Kairi could feel the ground shaking
a bit. A full alarm was an extreme case.</P><P>“Where
is the alarm coming from?” Kairi asked, agitated. “There should
be a signal rocket, but I couldn't see it from my room.”</P><P>At
that moment, Naminè ran past them, coming out of Kairi's room. Tifa
noticed but knew already. She didn't say anything, pretending she
didn't see her. Naminè was wearing the clothes Kairi had worn
yesterday.</P><P>Seconds
later, the blond Keyblader joined the other two, still waiting for
Aerith. “Aren't you done yet? We don't have time! You don't have to
look perfect!” Tifa yelled. The sirens were still ongoing,
earsplitting in volume.</P><P>“I'm
ready!” Aerith came out of the shared bedroom, panting and
wheezing.</P><P>The
group left the house, moving in to the command center of Hollow
Bastion, Merlin's house. Leon was probably already waiting. They
didn't have to run that far to find the grim sword wielder.</P><P>“C
District. It's a level four alarm!” Leon yelled while running past
the group at full speed. Level four. The highest alarm that there
was. While level one could be handled by the defense system, level
two was a larger scale of stronger Heartless. Level three was already
an invasion. There had never before been a level four alarm.</P><P>“Someone
is leading them! They look like Heartless from Agrabah. Kairi! Didn't
you report that you sealed the local master of the Heartless there?!”
Leon shouted. The sirens didn't stop, and they were all running.</P><P>“I
did!” Kairi defended herself. Jafar had become a genie, but she had
tricked him into a game, mocking his intelligence. Aladdin, a local
thief, had helped her to steal Jafar's lamp and seal him in there.
Agrabah had been on the brink of destruction back then. It couldn't
be him. It was impossible.</P><P>“Don't
blame her, Leon! We have two Keybladers and we can fight to our
fullest in an uninhabited district. We will win!” Tifa shouted,
running left of Leon. Naminè had problems keeping up with the more
physically trained others.</P><P>“Tifa,
Kairi and I will go ahead! You two, come after us. Don't hold back if
you encounter the enemy. We can repair buildings, we cannot repair
hearts!” Leon ordered Naminè and Aerith, and left with the other
two, running ahead.</P><P>Nobody
knew that it was the beginning of a night that would last for a long
time.</P>
