<h1>Valiant Hearts II (part 13 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kinghart/index.html">Kingdom Hearts</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yuritale.html">Yuritale</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kinghart/valiant2-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><p align='center'><i>Imbalance of Powers -</i></p><p align='center'><i>End of a 
Journey?</i></p><p>The hot flames had almost completely engulfed their shelter, the ash was 
swirling in the air. A mysterious darkness had eaten the clouds, deepening the grim 
atmosphere. A nightmare had come true. Their enemy had found them, floating at the top of 
the stable.</p><p>There was no time to lose. Summoning both Keyblades at once, Olette 
immediately took off, using the balks at the outside of the stable as platform to reach the 
top. If not for her insane training with Tifa, this would've been an impossible task. Naminè 
was still on the ground, in front of the burning stable. Having summoned Monochrome, she 
started firing weak ice magic at the stable, trying to prevent the fire from taking over 
other buildings.</p><p>Olette had to look out for burning planks that were falling down and 
was almost on the top when she hesitated a moment, not knowing where to jump 
next.</p><p>“Too slow!” Luxord yelled, vanishing in mid-air, virtually teleporting behind 
Olette, and hitting her with a card.</p><p>The pain was overwhelming. Nothing compared to 
when they had fought him on the ice field. Olette could feel the shock in every part of her 
body. The impact caused Olette to crash into the burning building, vanishing from both 
Luxord's and Naminè's visibility.</p><p>“Monster!”</p><p>Naminè was shouting at Luxord, 
preparing for another spell. She didn't care for the town anymore. With such a monstrous 
enemy, she couldn't be considerate of her surroundings. Luxord would not let her have the 
time to fully recite a spell. Naminè had learned from their first fight with Luxord that she 
was weaker than the others when it came to direct combat. Using the past few days to think 
of a way to counter that, Naminè had come up with a few tactics to prevent herself from 
being beaten up like on the ice field.</p><p>Firing several ice magics on the ground she was 
standing on, Naminè literally created a wall of massive ice around her, giving her some 
protection against Luxord.</p><p>Several long black things were lashing against the wall. 
Luxord wanted to avoid getting close to her. If she created an ice field like last time, she 
would freeze the entire town for all eternity, him included. A distance of at least thirty 
feet was necessary to avoid a fatal blow. But if he didn't break that wall...</p><p>“Damn it 
all!” Luxord angrily shouted, and made an instantaneous dash towards the ice blockade, 
giving up his position in mid-air, going on ground level. It withstood several brutal 
impacts until the first cracks showed up. Only a few more...!</p><p>Naminè's time was 
running out. She hadn't finished the recitation yet, and being unable to use higher grade 
magic instantly like Aerith was a huge handicap against such a powerful foe.</p><p>It broke. 
The ice broke, and Naminè was one second short of getting hit full-force by 
Luxord.</p><p>“As if I'd let you!” Olette came running out of the stable, burns all over the 
place, angrily throwing Hero's Crest after Luxord, who had no choice but to evade. An 
instantaneous movement later, he was again behind Olette, trying to repeat the previous 
attack.</p><p>“Now!” Olette yelled and let herself fall on the ground. It was wet, and she 
glided a few feet before coming to a halt.</p><p>“... <i>send me your infernal blaze</i>!” 
Naminè finished the recitation. Nothing seemed to happen.</p><p>Luxord fixed his eyes on the 
girl until he heard a weird swirling sound. Looking around him, dozens of fireballs were 
circling around him, ready to impact at any second. He could basically teleport, but not 
bypass matter. If he tried to get out of there, he would be hit by one of those things, 
probably causing all of them to ignite. He was imprisoned on the ground, robbed of his 
ability to float. Naminè was unable to walk away from the burning building without breaking 
the fire spell.</p><p>“Olette!” Naminè gave her friend a nod. Pointing at Luxord, she 
started her next spell. Relying on recitation magic was difficult, especially if it was a 
powerful one.</p><p>Olette, calling back Hero's Crest from the ground, sped up and ran 
towards the fireballs. She would hit the first of them in just a few seconds.</p><p>Naminè 
opened her eyes and pointed Monochrome at the ring of fire, which suddenly came to a halt. 
Olette used the moment to get in, and in less than half a second later, the fireballs were 
circling again.</p><p>Olette was an expert at close combat, and Luxord lacked space and time 
to evade in here. The circle had a diameter of less than fifteen feet, and Olette would have 
the definitive advantage in there.</p><p>Luxord summoned four cards around him, all of which 
showed the Ace of Hearts, and he hid himself behind them. Olette had little choice but to 
slash away at the cards, which were withstanding a lot of damage.</p><p>A double horizontal 
slash, followed by a combo of vertical slashes, kicks and punches, finished by a whirlwind 
attack, were unable to break through the ridiculously hard wall of cards. It was like 
hitting on steel.</p><p>“Naminè!” Olette shouted, and once again, the ring of fire opened, 
just to her back. A quick jump backwards later, each and every fireball started crashing 
into the card barrier, causing a huge explosion.</p><p>“<i>...so I plead thee, Raijin, send 
thy rage upon my enemy!”</i> From the dark clouds over them, a gigantic thunderbolt 
descended and impacted in the place the card barrier was, directly into the explosion of 
fireballs.</p><p>“Did we get him?” They couldn't see because of the 
smoke.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>In a mere second, the ground behind them broke up, and an angry and 
slightly burned Luxord came out, sending Olette flying. Two cards at once, and the impact 
was big enough to have Olette flipping over the ground before she finally crashed into a 
nearby building.</p><p>Olette instantly lost consciousness. Naminè was the only one left 
standing, and there wasn't enough time use any magic. Drawing a card, Luxord used its 
ability directly against Naminè.</p><p>The blond girl could feel a terrible impact at her 
chest, leaving her unable to breathe, thinking her heart had been crushed. Sinking to the 
ground, Naminè was still conscious but unable to even move a finger.</p><p>He didn't want to 
play around anymore. Luxord walked over to the building into which Olette had crashed. The 
girl was lying there, unconscious on the ground. An easy target for him. He would not make 
the error of leaving her enough time to recover.</p><p>The fire had gotten worse. Several 
buildings had caught fire, and the first Heartless showed up, coming out of the shadows one 
after another, an endless number of them.</p><p>The girl with the double Keyblades would be 
first. He hadn't forgotten the damage she had caused at the ice field. Even now, the 
long-healed wound still hurt when he thought about the attack. He had wanted to have his 
revenge, and he would not underestimate the Keyblader again.</p><p>Taking the Ace of Spades, 
Luxord used it to ram the impact into Olette's chest. And again. And again.</p><p>Olette 
coughed up blood, the impact shaking her whole body. And again. She would soon die if this 
continued. Naminè could do nothing, not even scream. Her mind was filled with the horrifying 
thought of Olette dying. But she couldn't do anything.</p><p>Why was he so strong? Or were 
they so weak? How could they have beaten him before? Was there so much of a difference 
now?</p><p>Naminè knew the answer. It was so obvious what was missing. Kairi.</p><p>“Time to 
end this,” Luxord said. Stepping back, he raised both his arms over his head, summoning an 
bigger version of the Ace of Spades.</p><p>Luxord screamed out. Darkness from the shadows 
was being drawn towards the card. And it grew. If this hit Olette, she would die for 
sure!</p><p>Naminè tried to ignore the pain, tried to get up, wanted to help Olette, to 
prevent the only friend she had left in this world from dying. She had already lost Kairi 
because of this man, she would not lose Olette too!</p><p>But it was hopeless. Her body was 
numb from the pain. Naminè couldn't even move a single finger, not even speak.</p><p>The 
card got even bigger. It had already surpassed Olette in size and still continued to 
grow.</p><p>If only Kairi had been with them. If only Kairi were here. They would never lose 
against anyone with her. If only...</p><p>“<i>Kairi!!”</i> Naminè managed to scream out, her 
last desperate call for help.</p><p>But nobody came. Luxord just ignored Naminè, continuing 
to let the card grow. He would shred the girl to pieces, to little, tiny 
pieces...</p><p>“Kairi...” Naminè started crying. Why did nobody come? Had all their hope 
been for naught? Why was she so weak? Why couldn't she help Olette? Naminè cursed her own 
weakness. She squeezed her eyes closed, unable to witness the end of her last 
friend.</p><p>Naminè just couldn't accept this. It was weak of her to always rely on Kairi 
in such a situation. She had to do something.</p><p>Naminè's whole being burned when she 
tried to get up. She managed to get on all four limbs, just to fall back down on the wet 
ground. Not giving up, determined to save her friend, she tried again. And managed to get in 
a upright position, if only kneeling.</p><p>Luxord didn't seem to notice her. Naminè had to 
hurry, the card was already the size of Luxord's body. If that thing hit Olette it would be 
too late.</p><p>“<i>Light of Yggdrasil, source of all being, grant those I love your 
blessing.”</i></p><p>A white light emitted from Naminè, flowing over to where Olette was. 
But this time, Luxord noticed it.</p><p>“You little wretch, are you still trying to avoid 
the inevitable? No matter what you do, you two will die here!”</p><p>Turning around, he 
changed his target. Not wasting any time, he started running towards Naminè, ready to blast 
the card right at her.</p><p>It was over. Naminè knew it was over. Even if Olette regained 
consciousness, she wouldn't be able to save her from this. Her legs refused to move, and 
there was not enough time to use any magic.</p><p>“<i>Impact!”</i> Luxord yelled, and a 
gigantic explosion occurred. Naminè could feel the shockwave and stone shards slicing open 
her arms. Naminè was numb from the pain, just seconds away from losing consciousness. 
Opening her eyes, she saw the impossible.</p><p>Looking up, just a few feet away, Luxord was 
lying on the ground. On top of him...was Olette. She had no power left to attack with her 
Keyblades. All she could do was run and tackle Luxord from behind as hard as she could, 
causing him to fall over.</p><p>In front of Luxord was a huge crater, at least thirty feet 
in diameter and a few feet deep.</p><p>Naminè's mind was hazy, and the last spell she had 
used to save Olette started to take its toll. Her vision went blurry and her head started to 
hurt like never before. Slowly falling unconscious, Naminè knew that even if she stayed 
conscious, there was nothing more she could do.</p><p>Luxord got up with such a speed that 
Olette was sent flying, crashing on the ground but not losing consciousness. Gritting her 
teeth, she summoned both Keyblades and ignored the massive pain everywhere in her body. She 
would not let Naminè's brave act go to waste.</p><p>“You really are the plague!” Luxord 
pointed at Olette, looking humiliated.</p><p>“Look who's talking!” Olette 
responded.</p><p>Luxord was tired of this game. Dashing towards Olette, he drew a couple of 
cards, attacking Olette head on.</p><p>Olette had the advantage in close combat, but her 
condition wasn't good. She had to try, no matter what the outcome would be!</p><p>Luxord 
looked at Olette, disgusted and angry, first trying to land a hit on her face, which was 
rigorously blocked by two Keyblades. It was hard to keep holding the Keyblades, Luxord's 
punch was ridiculously powerful. Just where had he gotten that strength? He hadn't had that 
kind of power before.</p><p>“It's time to end this little game of mine!” Luxord yelled, 
using another instantaneous movement to get behind Olette.</p><p>She knew what was coming. 
An impact. Barely turning around in time, Olette used the momentum of herself spinning 
around to kick Luxord in the ribs, sending him flying for a change. He crashed into a pile 
of wooden chests.</p><p>“You can't win, little girl. Not against me!” Luxord shouted, 
freeing himself of the wooden trash.</p><p>“Don't give up. We can beat him!”</p><p>Olette 
was shocked. Next to her...stood Kairi, out of breath and exhausted.</p><p>“I'll explain 
later, he's coming!”</p><p>Olette took a second too long to notice that Luxord was suddenly 
right in front of her. Kairi used the only means available and pushed Olette out of the way, 
herself taking a few steps back. Luxord took the bait and started to attack Kairi, who was 
able to block one attack after another. Luxord's punches had such force that it felt like 
someone was continuously stepping on her hands.</p><p>Olette was back on her feet and looked 
at Kairi fighting Luxord. She was half in a trance until she understood that it was all 
real. Kairi was alive, and a chance to win had come.</p><p>Running, ignoring pain and 
exhaustion, Olette attacked Luxord from behind, which forced him to turn around to keep from 
being attacked from both sides by the girls.</p><p>“You will never win against 
me!”</p><p>But with Kairi on her side, Olette knew she had a chance.</p><p>Luxord had other 
plans. Seeing as it was two versus one, he grew a little bit desperate. He would just knock 
out one girl with an impact and then...</p><p>He vanished. He vanished in the midst of the 
girls attacking him. But that was already a really familiar pattern to Olette. He would show 
up either behind herself or Kairi.</p><p>“Down!” Olette yelled in time, seeing how Luxord 
appeared right behind Kairi. With a last effort, Olette jumped at Kairi, pushing her to the 
ground—but for that, she suffered the effect of the card, which caused her to crash to the 
ground.</p><p>Luxord's expression was showing malicious joy. He was sure he won.</p><p>“I've 
won!”</p><p>“I don't think so.”</p><p>Before he knew what was happening, something hit his 
left leg, followed by a hit on his back that slashed open most of his spine. Kairi had made 
full use of Olette's sacrifice and had used the opportunity to attack Luxord when he let his 
guard down.</p><p>Luxord screamed out in pain and used a card to vanish. That was her 
chance.</p><p>“Naminè, get a grip!”</p><p>“...Kairi!?” Naminè tried to open her eyes, her 
vision blurry. It took her a moment to notice her sorroundings. Naminè couldn't believe her 
eyes. Kairi was kneeling next to her, using a cure spell, and then...there was Olette, lying 
on the ground, injured.</p><p>“I know you have a thousand things to say...but <i>he</i> 
could come back any second. Please, heal Olette, she is dying!” Kairi said, well knowing 
that it must be hard for Naminè to just accept it like that.</p><p>“But...but you were...” 
Naminè couldn't understand. It really was Kairi, she could feel it for some reason. But how 
had she gotten here?</p><p>“Naminè! Olette is <i>dying</i>!” Kairi emphasized it so that 
Naminé was getting a grip.</p><p>It worked. Naminè looked at Olette. If not for a powerful 
cure spell, she really would die from her internal injuries. As she immediately started the 
recitation, Kairi stood up, looking around. She herself was seemingly uninjured. The last 
time Naminé had seen her...Kairi had been dying. Just how...?</p><p>“He will come back any 
moment. I will explain everything once we get out of here.”</p><p>Kairi was unable to spot 
Luxord. He had just vanished on the spot, but she was completely sure she had gotten his leg 
and back. Even he would need a moment to heal those injuries. Kairi looked at Olette and 
knew that a simple Cure wasn't enough to heal her. If not for Naminè, Olette surely would've 
died.</p><p>“...a<i>nd in thy name, Phoenix, I plead you to grant this girl the life she 
deserves, and bring her back from the Gates of Hades!</i>”</p><p>Naminè finished her 
recitation and a bright red light descended from her hands into Olette, who immediately 
coughed up more blood, her body shaking from the abrupt healing of her inner injuries. 
Either the pain or the healing got Olette back to a conscious state.</p><p>“My head...” 
Olette opened her eyes and saw right next to Naminé...Kairi. So it hadn't been a dream, an 
illusion.</p><p>“Kairi!” Olette called out, trying to stand up.</p><p>“Naminè, use a cure 
spell on her. Just getting her back from dying isn't enough to have her fighting. We need 
her.<i> I </i>need her.”</p><p>“What happened to <i>him</i>?” Olette asked, recalling that 
she had protected Kairi and gotten hit by Luxord.</p><p>“I'll explain later, Olette, we've 
got to escape.”</p><p>Kairi knew that her attack wouldn't be enough to take him out. He was 
still somewhere out there, waiting for her to divert her attention.</p><p>Naminè finished up 
her cure recitation and Olette could feel the pain of her injuries being forcefully healed 
much faster than humanly possible. Gritting her teeth, Olette could feel feeling returning 
to her legs and arms, and the bleeding was fully stopped.</p><p>“Naminè, your status?” Kairi 
had the hope that Olette would put aside the matter of her coming back for now.</p><p>“I'm 
fine,” Naminè blatantly lied. It was obvious, she was squeezing her eyes closed and holding 
her head. But it was a clear sign of change to Kairi that Naminè was not 
complaining.</p><p>“Kairi, how—” Kairi put a finger to Olette's lips.</p><p>“Get your 
Keyblades. This is going to be really hard. The next portal is on the other end of the 
town.” Kairi spoke quickly; they had to avoid wasting any more time.</p><p>The ground was 
trembling, and the burning stable finally completely collapsed. The fire was spreading 
further, and soon, the whole town would be ablaze. They had no option. Their lives were more 
important than a town in another world.</p><p>Naminè only noticed it now, but there was no 
sign of the enemy. If Kairi really had gotten him, where was he? Olette didn't seem to know 
anything either. What had happened while she had been unconscious?</p><p>“As if I'd let you 
go!” Luxord appeared a good fifty feet away from them, his face giving away insanity and 
anger.</p><p>“I already thought one of you was missing. Pretty smart to wait until I let my 
guard down, but that won't happen again.”</p><p>Not wasting a single second, Luxord started 
running towards them. No teleport-like movement, no vanishing, he just plain started 
running.</p><p>“Naminè!” Kairi had faith in her, using her experience to do the right 
thing.</p><p>“Yes!” Naminè answered, and fired multiple ice magics on the ground, creating 
yet another wall of mirror-slick ice.</p><p>Luxord showed up right in front of the barrier, 
not even bothering to look at it, yet unleashing everything he had. The barrier was shaking 
and trembling with each hit, the first cracks showing up after a few 
moments.</p><p>Suddenly, the barrier broke, and Luxord lost his balance for a second. It was 
enough for the girls to deliver a counter blow.</p><p>Kairi and Olette were both approaching 
Luxord from behind, Kairi on the ground, Olette in mid-air. He had no time to bring up any 
defense. Kairi used a feint, and instead of hitting Luxord's legs, she slid past him, using 
the remains of the ice wall to fly up in mid-air.</p><p>Olette was about to hit when Kairi 
showed up behind her. Olette used both Keyblades to get a rotation starting, and Kairi used 
Oathkeeper to hit Hero's Crest full force. The repel force caused herself to hit the ground 
but accelerating Olette's whirl.</p><p>Luxord had enough time to get up the Ace of Heart, 
but against the whirling Keyblades, he had a hard time keeping it intact.</p><p>“<i>...and 
let the eternal frost freeze my enemy forever and all time!”</i> Naminè had finished her 
recitation. They had to escape, not beat him. Just freezing him would be enough.</p><p>“Damn 
it!!” Luxord had no choice but to disable his defense and escape, even if that meant getting 
hit by the rotating Keyblades.</p><p>The card vanished, and in the split second between that 
and the next, Olette finally managed to hit, almost cutting off his left arm. Luxord yelled 
out in pain. Blood was everywhere, and he used his remaining functioning arm to use a 
movement card.</p><p>The last time, he had taken a long time to treat his injuries with his 
powers. Kairi would take this chance to get them all out of this hell.</p><p>The town was 
burning, engulfed in flames. Screams of people, being eaten by the Heartless, burning to 
death. Ash in the air complicated their breathing. It hurt Kairi to not be able to do 
anything for these people, but staying here and fighting the Organization was just too 
dangerous.</p><p>“Go!” Kairi shouted, jumping over a burning carriage.</p><p>Olette knew 
that Naminè was still sick, but Kairi didn't, and it was unlikely that she would manage to 
run through the whole town. Without a word, Olette took Naminè on her back and following 
Kairi, slowly catching up.</p><p>Kairi knew that they had not much time. If he recovered 
before they reached the portal...</p><p>“Just...how did you survive?” Olette caught up with 
Kairi, and they both ran at full speed, ignoring the Heartless in their way, just trying to 
get as far away as possible from the monster from the Organization.</p><p>“Run, we talk 
later!” Kairi replied, trying not to waste her breath on talking.</p><p>“But...” Olette bit 
her lip, well knowing that Kairi was right.</p><p>Kairi gave her a nod. Naminé was conscious 
but didn't say a word, even though she really wanted to.</p><p>The fire was spreading faster 
than anticipated. Soon they were looking at a dead end further ahead. In front of them, a 
huge building collapsed.</p><p>“Naminè!” Kairi looked at the girl. It was asking much, but 
they couldn't be considerate of anything now.</p><p>She understood instantly. They could not 
make any detours. Every second was important. The enemy could catch up any second, and if 
that happened...</p><p>“<i>Great Lord of Fire, Ifrit, engulf what is yours, and let cease 
what stands in our way!”</i> Naminè shouted, pointing her Keyblade at the house in front. 
Seconds later, it was destroyed by a massive explosion.</p><p>“Close your eyes and jump!” 
Kairi ordered and used a former balcony as ramp to jump over the burning remains of the 
building.</p><p>Olette followed a second later. Both of them landed safely but suffered a 
few burns. But that was nothing compared to what they had endured in the past.</p><p>“Almost 
there!” Kairi yelled, her lungs on the edge of bursting.</p><p>Both Olette and Kairi were at 
their limits, but the gateway couldn't be much further away. Neither of them could leave on 
their own, they were dependent on each other.</p><p>“There!” Kairi pointed at a burning 
house near the east town gate.</p><p>Olette could feel her hope fall. If the keyhole was in 
there, they had a major problem.</p><p>“Naminè, use a reflect spell to protect us from the 
flames. Two minutes is enough.”</p><p>Kairi only knew the rough location. She was the only 
one out of the three that could detect gateways over a long distance. It could very well be 
anywhere in the house, or even above it, but this was their only chance.</p><p>Slowing down, 
Kairi stopped in front of the inferno, feeling the heat on her face. Concentrating, she 
tried to grasp the location of the keyhole better.</p><p>Naminè had almost finished the 
recitation spell when further away, a gigantic explosion took place. It was visible on the 
dark sky from all over the city.</p><p>“He is on his way,” Olette said, but they all already 
knew it.</p><p>“<i>Reality Shield!”</i> Naminè ended her spell, and the three of them were 
covered by a green shimmering light.</p><p>“Go!” Kairi gave a hand sign and the three 
entered the building.</p><p>It was terribly hot. Even though they were shielded against 
burns, the heat was immense, almost making them lose their senses.</p><p>Kairi stopped, 
looking around for a split second, then entered a door to the right.</p><p>The living room. 
The view was horrible. A whole family had died in here, and now their bodies were burning 
just below their feet. Kairi managed to control herself, but Olette couldn't and threw up, 
right outside the room. Naminé wasn't able to see the ground, but was worried what Olette 
might have seen to react that way.</p><p>“Here!” Kairi pointed at a swirl in the air that 
seemed unnatural. It was hard to see, but it looked different from the air around 
them.</p><p>“Use your Keyblades!” Kairi ordered, directing Oathkeeper at the 
point.</p><p>Olette let Naminè down, and Olette summoned Circle of Life. For whatever 
reason, she could only utilize the power of one Keyblade to open a portal.</p><p>Circle of 
Life, Monochrome and Oathkeeper's light rays combined at the point in the air, and slowly a 
gateway opened.</p><p>Another explosion, much closer than before. He was coming. If they 
didn't hurry...</p><p>Kairi didn't know if the Organization could enter the gateways, but if 
they could, they had to close the portal before he reached it. It took time to do so, and 
there was not enough of that.</p><p>“It's open!” Kairi shouted, waiting for Olette and 
Naminè to jump through it.</p><p>Olette managed to jump in at first try, but about three 
feet in mid-air was too high for Naminè. Reaching out her hand, Olette drew Naminè up, 
followed by Kairi, who jumped in.</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>The entrance of the 
house was torn to pieces. He was there, he found them. There was not enough time to close 
the portal!</p><p>“I will keep him busy! Olette, you close the portal!” Kairi 
ordered.</p><p>The pain of being slapped by Olette was much more than Kairi had 
expected.</p><p>“What are you saying, idiot?! I'm, no, we're not leaving you here, 
<i>again!</i>”</p><p>And time ran out.</p><p>“Why won't you pests just die?!” Luxord yelled. 
Only a few feet separated the girls from him. His raged increased indefinitely upon seeing 
the portal.</p><p>Not wasting a single second more, he made a dash towards the portal. The 
room was too small to use teleportation cards or to unleash any long-range 
attacks.</p><p>“<i>...so Titan, Lord of Ground, let the World tremble!”</i> Naminè had 
casted a spell without Kairi or Olette noticing.</p><p>A immense earthquake erupted, 
throwing Luxord off his balance. It was their only chance to escape. Kairi knew that Olette 
wouldn't let her sacrifice herself again, and Naminè had even thought ahead as far as 
this.</p><p>Kairi just gave a nod, and all three of them directed their Keyblades at the 
portal, closing it. Luxord was trying to reach it. His hand had already passed the border of 
the worlds when the portal finally closed, cutting off his hand and leaving a wounded Luxord 
back in the burning house that finally trembled under the quake.</p><p>They were all at 
their limits. Naminè lost temporarily consciousness, under the immense burden of so many 
recitation spells. Olette could only lay on her back, trying to catch her breath, unable to 
even move a finger. Kairi was in better condition than both of them, but refrained from 
doing anything. She too, was exhausted, and her body started to ache again.</p><p>They were 
finally safe, escaped from him. Just who was he? <i>What</i> was he? What was the 
Organization's true aim? And just how powerful were they? Kairi had so many question that 
were left unanswered, it was depressing.</p><p>Several minutes passed, the three of them 
sitting around, resting their bodies and minds, calming down. Barely escaping death had been 
a horrifying experience. The sheer difference in power was overwhelming. Even after all 
that, he surely was still alive.</p><p>Naminé had come to, and just by looking at Kairi, it 
was hard to comprehend that they were back together. Slowly getting up, Naminé walked over 
to where Kairi was sitting. It was cold on the paths, but there was this fuzzy and warm 
feeling that kept her going when looking at Kairi.</p><p>“Kairi...” Naminé was near tears, 
her body trembling. She had almost given up hope of finding Kairi, and now they were 
suddenly back together.</p><p>Kairi didn't say anything when Naminè knelt down and started 
hugging her, just laying her arms around the girl. Naminè just wanted to stay like that, but 
when Kairi started to pet her head, Naminè realized how unfair it was for only her to be 
like this with Kairi. A feeling of guilt came up inside her, and she looked over at 
Olette.</p><p>The brunette was sitting not too far away, looking at them, still catching her 
breath and trying to ignore the pain in her body. Olette wasn't the overly emotional type, 
not at all. But it still would've been nice to even hug Kairi once.</p><p>“Olette...” Naminè 
whispered, suddenly not feeling so good anymore. If being with Kairi was leaving out Olette 
like this, then it came with a really bitter taste.</p><p>Naminè let Kairi go, who was a bit 
surprised. She had imagined that Naminè wouldn't let her go for hours after they 
reunited.</p><p>Olette was surprised when Naminè held out her hand, waiting for Olette to 
take it.</p><p>“Even with Kairi, I'm lonely without you.”</p><p>Kairi didn't know what had 
happened while she was recovering, but it did seem like Olette and Naminè had grown much 
closer.</p><p>Olette let out a sigh, then stood up. For a second, she looked at Naminè, then 
closed her eyes and petted Naminè's head. She really was different from back then. She 
would've just cared about Kairi and forgotten about everything else.</p><p>Both of them 
walked over to Kairi, who stood up, and both of them looked at her, silent and with 
delighted expressions.</p><p>“I...I'm sorry, and...” Kairi started, not knowing how to 
explain everything.</p><p>“We're just happy that you're back,” both of them said at once. 
Smiling at each other, Olette and Naminè hugged Kairi, who was surprised at Olette's 
behavior.</p><p>“I'm really sorry, you two. I didn't know you two cared so much about 
me.”</p><p>Kairi had always been a bit slow when it came to such things. Often, she thought 
that people only protected her because she was a Keyblader.</p><p>“Stupid. Everyone cares 
about you. Aerith, Tifa, Yuffie, Leon, Cid and all the others!” Olette said, pretty angry 
about how Kairi was thinking.</p><p>“Olette is right...and...I don't know if I...we...could 
go on without you.” Naminè finally broke out in tears, leaning on Kairi's chest.</p><p>Kairi 
didn't know what to say. No one had ever said something like that to her. Just how could she 
answer that?</p><p>“You don't need to answer. I know you're not good with these things. Just 
don't do something so stupid ever, ever, again, you hear me?” Olette said, letting go of 
Kairi and taking her hand. She sat next to her, leaning on her shoulder.</p><p>“The hardest 
thing all this time was...not knowing if you were alive.”</p><p>Naminè had stopped crying, 
and just leaned on Kairi, closing her eyes and longing for nearness.</p><p>Olette had been 
silent for a while now, and it worried Kairi. She had been much more reserved before, so 
what had brought about that sudden change?</p><p>“I won't ever let go of you 
again.”</p><p>“You don't have to go that far, Olette.” Kairi was sort of embarassed. It was 
weird for Olette to say that. It seemed much more like a thing Naminè would say.</p><p>“No, 
I mean it. I won't ever let you go anywhere alone.” Olette turned around, looking straight 
into Kairi's eyes. There was this extremely determined brilliance in her eyes.</p><p>Kairi 
couldn't help but look confused.</p><p>Olette calmed down and let go of Kairi, just to stand 
up, walk behind her, and hug her from behind.</p><p>“Do you know how much I missed 
you...?”</p><p>Olette was just whispering in Kairi's ear.</p><p>“What...”</p><p>“I missed 
you so much...I thought my heart would break.”</p><p>Kairi blushed at those words and felt 
slightly uncomfortable.</p><p>“You're the first person to ever accept me for what I am. I 
don't know what I would do without you.”</p><p>Kairi was speechless. She hadn't known that 
Olette felt like that.</p><p>“So I'm not going to let you go anywhere alone. I will always 
be there for you.”</p><p>With that, Olette leaned her head on Kairi's back, closing her eyes 
for just a second.</p><p>Naminè opened her eyes and looked up at Kairi. It was like a happy 
dream for her to be finally reunited with Kairi. Just spending time like this, even if it 
was on the icy paths between the worlds. Naminè didn't feel cold when she was near Kairi. 
But it felt different from before, now that Olette was also with them. It felt better, 
warmer.</p><p>Naminè knew that there was still one problem, but they had time for that 
later. For now, she only wanted to enjoy being together with these two. Right. These two. It 
wasn't just Kairi anymore. Her world had expanded.</p><p>Time flew past as they continued to 
sit there in perfect silence. It was only after so long that curiosity got the better of 
Naminè.</p><p>“Just...what happened after the portal closed?”</p><p>“I want to know too,” 
Olette set after.</p><p>“It isn't a very eventful story, but I can tell you...we should get 
going, though,” Kairi said, looking at the closed portal.</p><p>She was uncertain if the 
Organization people could enter these gateways alone, but if so...they had already wasted 
way too much time.</p><p>“Naminè, can you walk?” Olette was almost used to carrying her, and 
it wasn't much of a burden anymore.</p><p>“I'm fine, but thank you.” Naminé didn't want to 
be anymore of a burden to Olette.</p><p>“After the portal closed, I was dying. I lost 
consciousness, and I guess I was really close to death when Sparrow found me. He had been 
hiding on top of a palm the whole time and watched our fight. He saved me and treated my 
wounds. He said I slept two days straight without waking up. The first time I woke up...I 
was so weak, I could only drink a bit of coconut milk.”</p><p>Kairi made a break and looked 
to her right side, where Naminé was walking. She really had changed. Naminè seemed much more 
mature than before. And Olette did too. She would've never expected her to come up and hug 
her like that.</p><p>“It continued for a while—I'm not sure how many days—until I was 
finally able to get up on my own. After that...I wanted to look for you two. I had a guess 
that you didn't leave this world. Sparrow helped me to steal a ship that was making a halt 
at the island.”</p><p>Olette stopped. It had been pure coincidence that they found each 
other. If Kairi had guessed wrong, and had left for Hollow Bastion, they both would've 
died.</p><p>Kairi noticed the brunette had stopped walking and looked at Olette, who was 
seemingly scared of her own thoughts.</p><p>“Are you okay, Olette?” Naminè asked.</p><p>“I'm 
fine, just...a bit tired.”</p><p>Olette caught up with the others, and Kairi continued her 
story.</p><p>“It was then that I remembered that both of you have Keyblades that were 
originally mine. I just concentrated on finding them, and managed to reach both of you in 
time. Sparrow said that he saw no profit in fighting our enemy, stole another ship, and 
left.”</p><p>Kairi shook her head and muttered something about unreliable pirates and greed, 
letting out a sigh at the end. Looking in turns at Naminè and Olette, she now wanted to know 
what happened to them.</p><p>“I'm sure a lot of things happened to you while I was gone,” 
Kairi started.</p><p>Olette and Naminè looked at each other. How much should they tell 
Kairi? Deep down, they decided to leave some parts out, such as them talking about how she 
liked Kairi, and Olette stealing food and them being chased out.</p><p>Olette nodded and 
took a deep breath.</p><p>“Right after we left the pathway...”</p><p 
align='center'>---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>“But Your Majesty, why aren't we taking the Gummi 
Jet to travel?” a croaking voice spoke to a much smaller figure in front of him.</p><p>“We 
need to not be seen. We have the chance to travel unseen by the eyes of Maleficent, so we 
should use it. There are also the new enemies Leon reported,” the small figure answered in a 
squeaky voice.</p><p>“Who was that again?” a rather dull voice asked. He was the tallest of 
the group, almost twice in height compared to the croaking voice.</p><p>“The leader of the 
group that has the Keyblader girl, you dumbass,” the croaking voice said, obviously annoyed 
at the taller one.</p><p>“Oh, yeah. So why are we going there?” He didn't seem to notice 
that he annoyed the other one.</p><p>“Just keep your mouth shut and keep 
walking.”</p><p>“Now, now, both of you, don't argue. We're soon there, we're right now 
passing another world, so there shouldn't be any Heartless for a while,” the smallest figure 
said.</p><p>“Yes, Your Highness!” both figures replied synchronously, and saluted.</p><p 
align='center'>---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>“And then we started fighting that guy...you know 
the rest.” Olette finished her story.</p><p>Kairi was a little depressed about how much 
Olette and Naminè had suffered because of her. But it didn't help them that she felt 
bad.</p><p>“Just how far away from Hollow Bastion are we? I don't remember the way at 
all...” Naminé said, nervously looking around. She had a grim feeling that they weren't in 
safety yet.</p><p>Kairi knew the way, and they still would have to walk at least a little 
over a hour to get to the keyhole that led to Hollow Bastion.</p><p>“Are you tired?” Olette 
asked.</p><p>“No, it's just...I'm a bit scared. What if that guy finds a way to follow us?” 
Naminè replied.</p><p>“That won't happen. The gateways only open for those with the 
Keyblades. He has no way to follow us,” Kairi interrupted.</p><p>If Kairi was right, they 
were safe. But the gateways were just that—gates that connected little paths with the worlds 
amidst the mass of darkness. But if the Organization had a way to penetrate the small shield 
of those paths, they could enter from the darkness...</p><p>“We're gonna be okay,” Kairi 
assured them.</p><p>“I wonder about that.”</p><p>It was like icy water that ran down their 
spines. There was no mistaking it. That voice came out straight of a nightmare.</p><p>They 
looked in front of them. He stood there, a good deal ahead, ready to attack them anytime. 
They could feel it. He was literally enjoying their fear.</p><p>Olette wanted to shout, 
“Naminé getting ready for a spell!” but Kairi knew that he was at a massive advantage and 
held them back with a hand sign. They had no place to escape to, no chance. They were worn 
out, and if one of them fell off the path in the darkness, there was absolutely no way 
back.</p><p>“How did you get here? Nobody but us Keybladers should be able to enter these 
paths!”</p><p>Kairi was trying to win time by asking questions. She had to come up with some 
sort of plan. If everything else failed, they had to try and take the next portal, no matter 
which world it led to.</p><p>“You sure think of yourself all high 'n mighty, don't 
you?”</p><p>He was laughing. Luxord was laughing. He knew they couldn't escape here, and he 
had the advantage both in power and field. He could easily draw out thousands of Heartless 
on one of these paths. Why not enjoy their fear a bit more and keep talking? There was 
nothing and nobody left that could stop him.</p><p>“These paths have been here from way 
before the first Keyblader was born. They are the Anu Dazo, as the Superior calls them—the 
paths of darkness. It is more of a mystery that you are here than that I 
am.”</p><p>Launching a surprise attack when he let his guard down? The chance of that 
working was too small. He was clearly superior in terms of power and combat experience. What 
else was there? The next portal was over three hundred feet away. If they used a massive ice 
spell to block the way, would they make it? But—</p><p>“Now who is sounding all high 'n 
mighty? We beat you once, what makes you think we can't do it again?!”</p><p>Olette had 
reached her limit. This guy was the source of all their misery—heck, it was his fault that 
Kairi almost died. She wanted to beat him up so badly that it hurt to just stand back and do 
nothing.</p><p>Olette tightened her grip on her Keyblades, knowing full well that she 
wouldn't be able to hold herself back much longer. While keeping up a facade of believing 
that Kairi was alive she had suppressed a lot of emotions, and they were coming 
out.</p><p>Kairi could have hit Olette. What good did it do to provoke Luxord now? If he 
attacked now, they had no chance of winning.</p><p>Luxord laid a hand on his forehead, his 
voice trembling a bit. He was clearly angry. Really angry. Being reminded of his loss at the 
ice field, the shame and the ignominy was all but pleasant.</p><p>“I don't like fighting 
someone without a name. What is yours?”</p><p>Kairi tried to get the conversation back in 
motion, but it was too late. Luxord was already angry, and he didn't want to spend a single 
second more looking at their faces. He would eliminate them once and for 
all.</p><p>Suddenly, without a warning or anything, Luxord made a dash towards Olette. He 
grabbed at her face with his right arm, pushing Olette violently on the ground. A split 
second later, both Kairi and Naminè could feel the emitting force on the ground. He had used 
an impact directly at Olette's face.</p><p>“One out.”</p><p>He was tired of playing around, 
tired of fighting these brats. It was time to dispose of them.</p><p>Kairi tried to launch a 
counter attack but he was too fast. He virtually vanished from her field of vision, and 
before she knew it, something sharp and long hit her on the back. Piercing pain ran through 
her body—of her back being slashed open. It was just too much to bear and even though she 
didn't lose consciousness, Kairi was paralyzed by the pain.</p><p>“Two out.”</p><p>One more. 
He would just drop the bodies in the darkness beneath the path. They would vanish for 
good.</p><p>Naminè was all alone. He knew her abilities, that she was a spell caster, like 
Demyx. But she was also helpless if she couldn't finish a spell. That was the reason Demyx 
had come up with his water clone spell.</p><p>“Your friends aren't dead. Not yet.”</p><p>And 
again, Luxord started laughing. A honest to goddess villain laugh, one that had gone insane 
long ago.</p><p>“Well, enough of this. I won't make this fast or painless.”</p><p>And he 
didn't. He slowly walked towards Naminè, drawing a card, showing it to her—The Ace of 
Spades—and grinning. He had won. Finally. They had been stupid enough to escape to a place 
surrounded by darkness.</p><p>“<i>Great Will of Fire, grant me your power 
and</i><i>—</i><i>”</i> Naminè felt a impact at her stomach, too weak to be the Ace of 
Spades, but strong enough to send her flying.</p><p>Luxord knew that he couldn't 
underestimate the girl's spells, but it didn't take much to cancel one.</p><p>Naminè had to 
go for a shorter version. Kairi was in dire need for a cure spell. Olette too. And he was 
seemingly still uninjured.</p><p>Just how did he survive all they had done to him? How had 
he recovered so fast? It was so unnatural, it was almost like he was not 
real.</p><p>“<i>Blaze of the Gods, burn my ene—”</i></p><p>A brutal kick in the face. Naminè 
was sent flying yet again, crashing on the icy ground, rolling over. Her face hurt really 
bad, and she could feel blood running down from her lips and nose. But what could she do? If 
she shortened the recitation any more, it would be like a slightly stronger grade I spell. 
She wouldn't even scratch him with that.</p><p>Naminè tried to stand up. She knelt on all 
four limbs, looking at the blood on the ground, dripping from her face. Was this it? Had 
they fought that valiantly to be defeated like this? She...she had to do 
something!</p><p>The pain was immense. It was like every single bone in her back broke. The 
force of the impact pushed her on the ground, unable to even move a finger.</p><p>“Three 
out. That's all of them. Time to get rid of them.”</p><p>Grabbing Naminè by her hair, 
pulling her along, Luxord walked over to where the other two girls were lying on the ground. 
Kicking Naminè in the side, he walked over to Olette and sat down on her back, showing not a 
grain of respect for his defeated enemies.</p><p>Really, this had been such a hassle. Good 
that he had followed Xigbar's advice. The battle in the town would've gone terribly wrong if 
not for that.</p><p>Digging in his cloak, he finally found what he was looking for—a case of 
cigarettes. Taking one out and putting it on his lips, he proceeded to light it with a card. 
Taking a deep breath, Luxord finally calmed down.</p><p>Looking down, he could see Kairi 
fixating him with her eyes, angrier than ever, loathing him. It annoyed him. Still daring to 
defy him, that girl was getting on his nerves.</p><p>He would dispose of her 
first.</p><p>Grabbing Kairi by her hair, he slowly walked over to the edge of the path. The 
iciness was even painful for him. There was nothing but darkness from there 
on.</p><p>Pulling Kairi up, still on her hair, he held her over the edge. Almost instantly, 
Heartless showed up, grabbing her legs, arms, swarming all over her. Luxord had a hateful 
smile on his face as he looked straight into Kairi's eyes. Eyes that were filled with hate 
and fear.</p><p>“See you in <i>hell!</i>”</p><p align='center'>---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>It 
was dark. It was like the loneliness had a tight grip of her heart. How long had it been? 
She didn't know. It was like a piece of her life had been stolen by the darkness. What 
should she do? Why was she so powerless?</p><p>It was cold. Much colder than it should have 
been. The nights seemed endless, and the days dull and matte. Every day, her hope shrank 
even more.</p><p>A creaking sound. The stairs. Someone came down the stairs. It couldn't be 
her, could it?</p><p>The steps came closer and closer, coming to a halt right next to her. 
No words were said. They understood each other without that.</p><p>“Kairi will come back, 
I'm sure.”</p><p>A gentle voice, trying to ease the other one a bit.</p><p>“Aerith...I just 
can't take it any longer.”</p><p>Tifa was at her limit. Barely sleeping and eating, she had 
been worried sick ever since the morning they had noticed Kairi, Naminè and Olette were 
gone. At first, they had thought they were just hiding, but after days had passed, Tifa was 
sure that they had left for another world.</p><p>Laying a hand behind Tifa's neck, Aerith 
slowly pulled Tifa towards herself, caressing her back.</p><p>Aerith herself was just as 
worried as Tifa, but she wasn't in such a bad condition. Each single day, Tifa spent her 
time looking around Hollow Bastion, looking for any signs that Kairi had returned. But there 
was nothing. With time passing, Aerith started to believe that Kairi was being held up in 
another world, be it by the new enemy or by Heartless. Her only hope was that those three 
were strong enough to overcome it.</p><p>“Do you really think Kairi will come back...or even 
wants to come back?” Her voice was trembling.</p><p>“Silly, we're like family for Kairi, and 
she is family for us...why would she not want to come back?”</p><p>“But...why did she leave 
without saying a word then?”</p><p>Even Aerith didn't know that. She could only guess, but 
for now, saying something soothing to Tifa was more important.</p><p>“Kairi is only sixteen. 
It's that age. They're probably well and will laugh at us for worrying so much.”</p><p>It 
did sound silly, but Tifa lightened up a bit. Aerith always knew the right things to say. 
Tifa never regretted to have fallen in love with her. Thinking back, it was a shame that she 
had followed Cloud around for so long. There was only place for one thing in his heart, and 
that wasn't her. Aerith never failed to show how much she loved her.</p><p>“Thank you...I 
don't know what I would do without you.”</p><p>Tifa let herself go, sinking down on Aerith's 
lap, laying on the couch, looking at a dark room. Aerith proceed to play a bit with Tifa's 
hair, then caressed her cheek. It was important to both of them that Kairi came back, and 
especially in situations like these, that they were there for each other.</p><p>“I also 
don't know what you would do without me. You're terrible at house chores. And I'm sure you'd 
live off instant food like Yuffie. You'd get fat.”</p><p>Aerith was teasing Tifa a bit, and 
even though it was dark, she could feel how Tifa was showing a small smile. It put Aerith at 
ease, seeing that Tifa wasn't drowning herself in desperation anymore. They had done this 
almost every night since Kairi was gone, and only then was Aerith showing how much she was 
worrying about Kairi. It didn't make her suffer as much as Tifa, but she really did need the 
support of her partner in such a hard time.</p><p>“You're mean. But I know it's 
true.”</p><p>Tifa moved over, now looking right up in the face of her lover. It had been 
some time since they slept with each other, and neither of them was really in mood for it 
since Kairi left. But Tifa was longing for some nearness, longing for caresses.</p><p>Aerith 
leaned over Tifa and moved one finger over her lips. It was like she could read Tifa's 
mind.</p><p>“Don't, it would taste horrible. I forgot to brush my teeth.”</p><p>Of course 
she was just teasing Tifa again. It was a little game of ever-circling teasing with those 
two.</p><p>“I don't mind. Didn't brush mine either.”</p><p>Aerith made a exaggerated 
disgusted expression and then bowed down, kissing the black-haired woman gently, delighted 
that there was someone she could share her worries with.</p><p align='center'>---Valiant 
Hearts---</p><p>“I won't let you do that!”</p><p>Luxord was surprised. Who dared to defy 
him, so close before his goal? Who was fool enough to attack him?</p><p><i>Something</i> 
tall and oddly-shaped crashed into him before he could react, forcing him to drop Kairi, who 
was caught by the odd something.</p><p>“Goofy, bring her back to the others and then provide 
back up for me. Donald, you heal them please. I will face him. He is a formidable 
opponent.”</p><p>Luxord knew who was in front of him. Of all times, why did <i>he</i> have 
to show up here, at this very moment? He had been so close to finishing them, and now he was 
further away than he had ever been. Things were not in his favor.</p><p>“Why are you here, 
little King?” Luxord had to think. What had Zexion written in his report about the little 
king? If he could only recall it!</p><p>“I don't think a villain needs to know why and where 
I go!”</p><p>“King Mickey, who is that guy? What was he doing with those 
girls?”</p><p>Mickey. The king of Castle Disney, a Keyblader of a much earlier generation 
than Kairi. He was keeping Maleficent in check, preventing the Heartless from taking over 
any more worlds.</p><p>“Goofy, Donald, watch out for him. He should be really 
strong.”</p><p>“He sure looks weird, yeah,” Goofy replied.</p><p>“Look who's talking!” 
Luxord angrily replied.</p><p>What kind of joke was this? Not only had he to fight the king 
himself but also his bodyguards. From sight alone, he could tell that this duck was able to 
use high-level magic instantaneously. That was a real problem. And that tall something—even 
though it looked about as smart as a rock, it wasn't to be underestimated. He had tackled 
him without him even noticing he was there.</p><p>It would be a fool's act to fight the king 
of Castle Disney here. He was strong enough to hold Maleficent, one of the masters of the 
Heartless, in check. Fighting him without knowing his abilities could prove to be a 
devastating error.</p><p>“This...this is not the last you'll see of me!” Luxord yelled, 
opening a portal of darkness behind him and escaping.</p><p>Mickey was delighted. He did not 
want to fight a member of Organization XIII on an Anu Dazo, a path of darkness. He had 
recognized Kairi the instant he saw her. But who were the other two girls? Leon had written 
in his message that he had welcome news regarding the Keyblade, but were those two related 
to it? Could they possibly be...?</p><p>“Donald, how are they?” Mickey was looking at his 
court magician with worried eyes.</p><p>“They're in pretty bad shape. With Curega magic 
alone, they'll make it, but they will need to recover by themselves for some 
time.”</p><p>Mickey let out a sigh and looked at Kairi. She had finally lost consciousness 
when Goofy tackled Luxord and almost dropped her in the infinite darkness. Just how strong 
was the Organization?</p><p>“Goofy, you pick up the brunette and the blond girl. Donald, use 
a gravity spell to have the remaining girl floating next to you. We should arrive in a hour 
or less at Hollow Bastion.” Mickey looked ahead, hoping there wouldn't be any more obstacles 
to this journey.</p><p align='center'>---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>“Leon, why didn't you ask 
him to look for Kairi?!” Tifa was pushing Leon against the wall.</p><p>They had called the 
two women to a meeting, talking about what they would do if Kairi did not return, what they 
would do <i>if</i> she returned, or rather what punishment they would give her, and Leon 
informed everyone that the king of Castle Disney was supposed to arrive this very 
day.</p><p>Tifa was first shocked and then unimaginably angry that Leon had the means to 
contact the king and didn't tell him that Kairi had vanished.</p><p>“Just how many worlds do 
you think there are, Tifa?! Should he leave the Heartless alone and abandon countless worlds 
to look for Kairi, who could be in a dozen different worlds?!”</p><p>“But still...! 
Still...” Pushing him once again against the wall, Tifa went on.</p><p>“We all miss Kairi, 
Tifa. But...Leon is right. Even if we knew which world Kairi was in, how long do you think 
it would take to find her? Kairi is a important to us all, but we can't just desert 
countless worlds for her sake.” Yuffie, looking depressed that she had to say all that, 
tried to calm down her friend.</p><p>Tifa felt defeated. Yuffie was right, she knew that. 
But what should she do? Just give up and wait for Kairi to eventually return?</p><p>“Wow, 
hey, the machine is picking up a signal. The portal at the library is opening!” Cid 
interrupted and gave the round a meaningful look.</p><p>Not a minute passed and the whole 
room was empty with the exception of Leon. He stayed back for his own reasons.</p><p>“Tifa 
is becoming a problem.”</p><p>Tifa was running as fast as she could. Only Yuffie was able to 
keep up with her, leaving the others way behind them. Blood rushed in Tifa's ears; she was 
unable to think straight. It must be Kairi who was coming back. It had to be!</p><p>“She 
really cares about Kairi the most, huh?” Cid was running next to Aerith.</p><p>“I'm the 
exception to that rule,” Aerith answered.</p><p>The mechanic decided to just shut up and 
save his breath.</p><p>Tifa and Yuffie had already reached the library. There, in front of 
the portal, they couldn't trust their eyes.</p><p>“What...what happened to them...?” Yuffie 
was worried. Kairi, Naminè and Olette were in pretty bad shape. Injured all over the place, 
but it seemed like their wounds had already been treated a bit by magic.</p><p>Tifa was just 
speechless and knelt next to the unconscious Kairi.</p><p>“They're alive, don't worry. 
Donald healed them, but they will need to rest some time before walking around,” Mickey 
explained.</p><p>Slowly, the others reached the library, looking at the three beat-up girls. 
Aerith knelt next to Tifa, taking her hand, whispering something in her ear.</p><p>“They're 
going to be okay.”</p><p>Tifa was in shock. It was just too much at once. Her head felt like 
it was going to explode any second. Her vision went fuzzy and she started 
shaking.</p><p>Yuffie, knowing that Tifa was about to faint or worse, took her hand and led 
her away from the girls. She knew how much Tifa had suffered in these past days. It would be 
better for her to first calm down before going back in. Digging in her pouch, Yuffie took 
out a small can. She opened it and gave it to Tifa.</p><p>“Did she...?” Aerith was worried 
when Yuffie returned alone.</p><p>“I gave her some canned tea. You don't want her to faint, 
right? That's a hundred-fifty munny for the tea.”</p><p>“You're a real money maker, aren't 
you? But...thank you. I sometimes don't know what I would do without you, 
Yuffie.”</p><p>Yuffie just smiled and then looked at Kairi.</p><p>“Just who did this to 
them? It looks horrible.”</p><p>Aerith shook her head, unable to answer that question. But 
whoever did it, one day, she would pay them back.</p><p>Cid had led Mickey, Donald, and 
Goofy out of the library and back to the house they used for meetings, where Leon was 
waiting.</p><p>“King Mickey, it's good to see you.”</p><p>A formal greeting. Leon preferred 
to be reserved with the king of Castle Disney. He seemed nice and friendly, but he had a 
natural mistrust against people.</p><p>“Good to see you too, Leon.”</p><p>A moment of 
awkward silence emerged between the king and Leon. He didn't trust Mickey's companions. It 
was his motto. Only trust yourself and those your life depends on.</p><p>“Donald, Goofy, can 
you leave us alone for a moment? Stand guard at the door, please.”</p><p>He could feel the 
vibes of displeasure from his loyal subjects. It wasn't nice of Leon to mistrust them, but 
given how his world was taken by the Heartless, there was no one that could blame him on 
that.</p><p>“The fact that you are here and the others aren't tells me that you brought our 
lost sheep back home.”</p><p>Leon was more than just displeased with this development. He 
had planned to use the news of two new Keybladers to exchange information. They were in need 
of information, regarding both the Organization and what the Heartless were 
doing.</p><p>“And I guess I know what you wanted to tell me. The girls with Kairi are also 
Keybladers, aren't they?” Mickey was sharp. It was easy to figure out that a girl that was 
traveling with a Keyblader, with no apparent weapon, must be a Keyblader too.</p><p>“I'm 
coming straight to the point. What can you tell us about the Organization XIII, the one that 
has been utilizing those white creatures?”</p><p>Mickey sighed and looked around, as if 
someone was listening in. What Leon asked of him was highly dangerous information and if the 
wrong ears heard them...</p><p>“Organization XIII. The Nobodies. They are the shells that 
were left behind by truly great people. Good or bad, doesn't matter. If someone of great 
importance is made into a Heartless, the shell that is left behind will continue to 'live' 
on. It is a sad life, without emotions and without heart. In a sense, they are to be 
pitied.”</p><p>Silence. He hadn't heard enough. It was important information to know 
<i>who</i> your enemy was, but it was just as important to know <i>what</i> he was up 
to.</p><p>“Even I don't know what they're planning. Their leader—they call him 'The 
Superior'—seems to be an absurdly powerful being. We can only guess at his motives. But one 
thing is clear. They're neither our nor the Heartless' allies. They're powerful and they 
have their own goals.”</p><p>“Not as powerful as you think. We raided their place on a whim, 
and thinking back, it was a stupid thing to do. But the majority was against me, I couldn't 
have stopped it anyway. If all of them are only as strong as the ones we fought, then there 
is nothing to fear. The Heartless are more of a threat.”</p><p>Leon remembered the fight. 
They had been hardly a challenge. But if they were so weak, why was the king thinking of 
them as a powerful Organization? Something wasn't right. And it wasn't the king.</p><p>“Are 
you absolutely sure they're this powerful? When I fought one, it was hardly any different 
from fighting a low-class Heartless. Just—”</p><p>“Don't be fooled. Are you absolutely sure 
they sent out their most powerful fighters? They saw you coming, didn't they? They let you 
invade the place, steal their data, and the people you fought were weak.”</p><p>Just where 
had he gotten this information from? Detailed info on their trip was supposed to be top 
secret information. But asking wouldn't get him an answer. The king never named his 
sources.</p><p>“Just go and take a look at Kairi. They were three against one, and looking 
at them and him, he could have beaten them with a blindfold on. I can't be sure, but he was 
about as strong as I am. The Heartless are weak to the Keyblades. They fear and hate, they 
love and desire it. But the Nobodies have neither fear nor hate for it. To them, it is just 
another blade.”</p><p>“So what do you propose we should do?” Leon was getting impatient. The 
king kept telling him that the new enemy was much more powerful than he had ever imagined. 
If that really was true, he had to reconsider a lot of things.</p><p>“For now, stay put. 
Even they wouldn't dare to attack you here. Kairi and those other girls—can you tell me 
their names?—need rest. They won't be able to fight for some time. I also fear that the 
Heartless see a threat in the Nobodies, and Maleficent seems to be up to something extremely 
dangerous. My hands are tied with the recent events. We only can wait for now.”</p><p>With 
that, Mickey looked around yet again, as if someone were eavesdropping. It was a bad habit 
that he had developed when people started allying with the Heartless.</p><p>“Just stay put? 
Is that all we can do?” Leon was clearly annoyed at this turn of events.</p><p>“I know you 
want to stop the Heartless. I know that you want to get your world back. But not everything 
will always follow your will. You need to accept that, Leon.”</p><p>With those words, Mickey 
put up his hood and left the room. He quickly spoke with Donald and Goofy, then walked away 
in the direction of the castle.</p><p>Leon was left alone in the room. The sun was slowly 
setting, just like his hopes to get her back. The night's darkness started to wrap up the 
town in its iron clutches, just like the darkness in Leon's heart.</p><p>Whispering one last 
word, Leon too, left the meeting room and went to his apartment. Only emptiness and the 
darkness of the one reoccurring nightmare awaited him.</p><p>“<i>Ri...”</i></p><p 
align='center'>---Valiant Hearts---</p><p>It was warm and soft. Was this heaven? Had she 
lost the fight and died? Slowly opening her eyes, Kairi looked around. If this was heaven, 
then heaven looked amazingly similiar to her room back in Hollow Bastion.</p><p>“Welcome 
home, Kairi.”</p><p>Startled, the redhead looked to the right side, where a tall 
black-haired woman sat on the ground, next to the bed.</p><p>“Tifa...Tifa, is that really 
you?” Kairi couldn't believe what was happening.</p><p>“Are...the other two—” Kairi had 
problems speaking. Her throat hurt and there was a stinging pain in her head.</p><p>“Naminè 
and Olette are okay. They're sleeping next door. Aerith is with them. It took a lot out of 
her to heal you three...and...”</p><p>Aerith had advised Tifa not to go overboard, but it 
was just too much.</p><p>“I'm just...so happy...that you're back. I...we...were so worried! 
I wouldn't know...what to do...if you had died out there!” Tifa was sobbing and even though 
Kairi felt at fault, she was unable to say anything.</p><p>It was her fault. It was all her 
fault. She had underestimated the dangers of this journey, and they had almost paid with 
their lives for it.</p><p>“I'm...I'm so sorry, Tifa.” She felt miserable, and looking at 
Tifa, she knew why. Making someone else feel like that, because of her own stupid 
stubbornness, was really the worst. Kairi could only cry in silence, knowing 
that.</p><p>“You better be! God, Kairi, why did you do something so stupid! We were worried 
sick...you're like family to Aerith and me...you could have talked to us.” Tifa was now 
openly crying, and Kairi could feel just how much pain she had inflicted in her foster 
parents.</p><p>The door opened, Kairi could hear it. The pink dress, the long hair bound to 
a braid...</p><p>“Aerith...”</p><p>“Don't talk, you will have to do plenty of that tomorrow. 
Just sleep. And...welcome home, Kairi.”</p><p>Aerith knelt down behind Tifa, who was still 
sobbing in Kairi's blanket, patted her back, pulled her slowly up, and embraced 
her.</p><p>“There, there...she's alive and back, that's all that counts.”</p><p>“But...but!” 
Tifa couldn't talk anymore.</p><p>Kairi felt unimaginably bad for making Tifa feel like 
that. It hurt herself, hurt her mind, hurt her heart, to see Tifa like that. She hated 
herself for this, hated her weakness, but foremost, her stubbornness...</p><p>Kairi would 
never do that again. Seeing those two like that was much worse than anything she had 
suffered by the hands of that man.</p><p>“I won't ever...do...something like..this again.” 
Kairi pressed out, and started coughing, feeling dizzy and sick.</p><p>Both Tifa and Aerith 
looked at Kairi, knowing that she meant it with all her heart. They could see that she was 
really sorry.</p><p>“Sleep a bit. We'll talk tomorrow...and...I love you, Kairi. You're like 
a daughter to me. Tifa feels the same.”</p><p>Kairi felt like something huge had hit her 
chest. Unable to respond and suppressing the urge to start crying openly, Kairi only nodded, 
and felt that her tears just wouldn't stop. Kairi was crying, but this time, her feelings 
were mixed. Relived that she was finally back at home, that Tifa and Aerith were thinking of 
her like that, and even more so, regretting that she hadn't trusted them, and had done 
something so stupid.</p><p>The women left the room, and Kairi was left alone in the 
darkness. Her thoughts wandered to the two girls in the next room. What would they say 
tomorrow? Kairi was afraid of being disliked.</p><p>Something made a sound on her window. A 
very quiet screeching sound. Before Kairi could figure out what it was, the window opened 
from the outside, and something jumped inside.</p><p>“Yo.”</p><p align='center'>---Valiant 
Hearts---</p><p>“Kairi is well, she is sleeping next door.”</p><p>Aerith was talking to 
Olette. Naminè had been in the worst condition out of the three and was still 
unconscious.</p><p>“That guy...he was...so strong. We didn't stand a chance.”</p><p>Olette 
could only think back in fear, afraid of that man. It wasn't just that he was stronger than 
them, he was on a whole different level. Just how did they beat him the first time? Was that 
really the same person?</p><p>“Save that for tomorrow. Get some rest. I know you're a tough 
girl, but you need rest. You can talk to Kairi tomorrow.”</p><p>Aerith was about to go and 
check on Kairi and Tifa. She was tired. So tired. The constant anxiety was finally showing. 
But she was also really happy that all three of them had come back alive.</p><p>“But—” 
Olette wanted to speak with Kairi now. Just seeing her would be enough. But Aerith wouldn't 
let her get up.</p><p>“No buts. Your injuries are too old to treat them with magic. I did my 
best to treat what was still in my power when the king brought you here. You need 
rest.”</p><p>Aerith could be really strict. Olette knew when it was pointless to argue and 
gave up. And Aerith was right too. Her body was heavy, her mind a bit hazy. Getting up would 
be impossible without help.</p><p>“Good night. Sleep well. Tomorrow is going to be a busy 
day.”</p><p>“Good night.”</p><p>Turning off the lights, Aerith left the room, leaving Olette 
behind in the darkness. It was a welcome darkness, one that helped to put her mind at 
ease.</p><p>But then, something made a screeching sound at the window. Olette was shocked 
for a moment, thinking the enemy had found them, but then, that was impossible. One alone 
wouldn't attack them. She was just nervous.</p><p>The window opened. Olette almost panicked 
when something jumped in, stand up and waved at her.</p><p>“Yo.”</p><p>“Yuffie!” Olette 
called out, almost too loud.</p><p>“Ssh, be quiet. Aerith is going to kill me if she finds 
out. And I'm not joking!”</p><p>Sneaking over to the bed, Yuffie got a closer look at 
Olette, then at Naminè.</p><p>“Wow, you're really beat up, aren't you?”</p><p>That line had 
a trace of mockery in it, making Olette slightly angry. “Are you here to make fun of 
us?”</p><p>“You want to talk with Kairi, right?” Yuffie changed the topic, knowing well that 
there was nothing Olette wanted more than that.</p><p>“Yeah, but I can't get 
up.”</p><p>“Well, I can't really get you over there, Aerith would notice us, but I could 
relay a message...for a price.” Yuffie had a huge grin on her face, and Olette finally knew 
to what this was coming to.</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>“You're washing my dishes. For a 
month. Every third day.”</p><p>“That's suicide.”</p><p>“Now, I think I should 
leave...”</p><p>Yuffie said it like she was absolutely not caring, and Olette took the bait. 
“Okay, okay, I'll do it. Jeez, you're evil.”</p><p>“So what do you want to say?”</p><p>“Just 
tell her, 'we don't hate you, we never will.' Okay?”</p><p>Yuffie let out a whistle and had 
a huge smile on her face. “Gotcha, that's easy. Anything else?”</p><p>Olette suddenly got 
embarrassed and whispered something else.</p><p>“Wow. Wow, wait a minute, 
really?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“I won't come back, even if Kairi has some answer, so I'll tell 
you tomorrow. If Aerith finds out, I'm going straight to hell. So, see ya 
tomorrow!”</p><p>“Hey, wait—” And gone she was.</p><p>Olette let out yet another sigh, 
sinking back in the warm pillow, seconds later already deep in the land of dreams.</p><p>“So 
that's what she said?”</p><p>Kairi was speechless. Just what in the world should she answer 
to that? Why did Olette even say something like that? What should she do now?</p><p>“Well, I 
guess my time is up, I'll be leaving. Sleep well, Kairi, and welcome home,” Yuffie said, 
leaving through the window just as she had come. A short click later, Kairi was again all 
alone with her thoughts.</p><p>“Olette...why...?”</p>
