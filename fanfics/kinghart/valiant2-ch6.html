<a href="../kinghart/valiant2-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><p align='center'><i>The confrontation I fear</i></p><p align='center'>Part III</p><p 
align='center'><i>End of an Beginning</i></p><p>“So you all failed,” he said with an cold 
yet utterly crushing voice.</p><p>They hadn't had much of a choice. The girl escaped, and 
now that they were asked, they didn't even have proof that Axel was dead. To top that off, 
Xigbar had been beaten pretty badly and wouldn't be able to run any missions anytime 
soon.</p><p>“Xemnas, there wasn't anything we could do beyond what we did. We didn't expect 
the fools from Hollow Bastion to come to that World at the exact same time. Also, another 
Keyblader girl showed up out of nowhere. She was with the girl from Hollow 
Bastion.”</p><p>Saix hadn't been left off lightly. Xemnas had punished him pretty bad and 
his face showed traces of that all over.</p><p>“So we have three Keybladers now? Xemnas, 
isn't that, somewhat, overkill?” Demyx interrupted and waved his arms around.</p><p>“Isn't 
that dangerous? One of them is easy to handle, but three might turn out a bit too much for-” 
He was disrupted by a energy ball that send him flying across the hall they were 
in.</p><p>“Fool. We can easily destroy them. They will serve us well. All there is to do, is 
to lead them on the right path. This will benefit our plan greatly,”<br>Xemnas replied to 
Demyx's outburst.</p><p>The atmosphere in the hall was virtually freezing when Xemnas turned 
around to watch the fruit of his hard work. Soon, it would be completed. Now, with two more 
girls that wielded Keyblades, it was just an easy task of waiting.</p><p>Initially, he had 
thought of killing the Keyblader from Hollow Bastion, but that had proven unwise at multiple 
occasions. Not only did they prove amazingly stubborn and durable, but also stronger than he 
had taken into account in his plan. It was much easier to leave those fools alone while they 
did the work of collecting hearts for him. He could dispose of them easily enough when the 
plan had been a success.</p><p>“You three shall remain here for the time being. Call Luxord 
and tell him to bring turmoil to another world. We need to have those girls collect more and 
more hearts for us. Soon, yes, soon, our plan will succeed.”</p><p>Without a word, the three 
left. Xigbar returned quickly to his room, burning with rage over his shame. Demyx, having 
no orders as of now, also returned to his room.</p><p>On the contrary, Saix went to tell 
Luxord of his new orders. Why Xemnas picked the old gambler was a mystery to him. Xaldin 
would be much more suited to that kind of duty.</p><p>The superior must have had some plan 
on his mind. It was very dangerous to let those fools from Hollow Bastion just do as they 
pleased.<br>Even if they now were far away from being able to beat him, he had taken some 
damage against those two brats. Xigbar was close to being defeated, and from what Demyx told 
him about the woman in pink, she was a very powerful magic user. What was Xemnas 
thinking?</p><p>“Luxord.”</p><p>Saix had found the gambler on the balcony and waited to 
continue until he has his full attention.</p><p>“Xemnas orders you to continue your work. He 
didn't order where, just go to a world nearby to Hollow bastion and sow turmoil and strife. 
Do as you please, but refrain from any unnecessary mistakes like the last 
time.”</p><p>Without waiting for his answer, Saix turned around and slowly walked 
away.</p><p>Luxord, one of the older members of Organization XIII, was also one of the more 
incalculable members. He was tall, blond, had several earrings and a distinctive light 
beard. His personality was as twisted as it could be but one way or another, he finished 
most missions to the satisfaction of Xemnas.</p><p>“I need to speak to Xemnas later. We need 
to stop those fools from Hollow Bastion. They're likely to interfere with our 
plan.”</p><p>Saix, still talking to himself, walked away in direction of the demolished city 
grounds the battle with the Hollow Bastion group had left. They wouldn't rebuild it. There 
were other important things.</p><p align='center'>--Valiant Hearts--</p><p>Tifa was worried 
about Kairi and Aerith. For a surveillance mission, this took already way too long. Cid 
refused to open the portal alone and had given her some overly complicated technical reason 
he won't even try.</p><p>“I hope it's just some harmless reason like they got lost and need 
to find the place. I don't want either of them to get hurt,” Tifa said to calm herself, 
wandering around.</p><p>They were overdue for more than three hours. It was impossible for 
Tifa to be calm anymore. To distract her mind, she had started patrolling the area quite a 
while ago. Of course, there wasn't anything unusual.</p><p>But Tifa was absolutely restless 
now. Another hour had passed and there was still not the slightest sign of Aerith, Kairi and 
Yuffie. She couldn't just sit around and wait anymore. With an iron-like determination, Tifa 
almost knocked down the door to Merlin's house in search for Cid. But he wasn't there; 
nobody was.</p><p>“Where the heck did Cid go?” Tifa swore and marched off.</p><p>She 
couldn't find Cid anywhere, not even in the usual places not near the mar that was often the 
testing area for his new tools and explosives.</p><p>But Cid wasn't there either. Tifa was 
quite angry, and completely devoid of a medium for her anger, she angrily punched the 
ground. Half of the cliff shuddered under the impact and the black haired woman felt a bit 
better. Losing her cool wouldn't help, but the recent events were a bit much for her not to 
worry.</p><p>Just as Tifa turned around to walk back to the living quarter, she heard 
something. The sound that was similar to what occurred when a portal opened. For a moment, 
she had been thinking that Kairi and Aerith were back, but this was quite some distance from 
the portal place. It wasn't them. That left only two other choices.</p><p>First, it was 
someone from the town, maybe Leon who was looking for her. She had left her post after all. 
But they would have called out to her. Well, Leon maybe not.</p><p>Second, and that was more 
likely, it was someone that was trying to enter this world unnoticed. And that wouldn't be 
unless the one had a very good reason not to be seen.</p><p>With a sudden movement, Tifa 
turned around and rushed in the direction the sound had come from. Whoever, and whatever, it 
was, right now was the worst time to get noticed.</p><p>There didn't seem to be a need to 
launch a full all-out attack. There really was someone there. But what, who, she found 
there... Tifa would never have guessed.</p><p align='center'>--Valiant Hearts--</p><p>“So, 
you're saying this... Portal thing here connects this world with another?”</p><p>Olette was 
standing in front of the keyhole gateway and gazed at it, still carrying Kairi. It was still 
open, and Aerith had given her a short explanation what it was. She didn't understand all of 
it, but the basic was, this was a portal that lead to another world.</p><p>“Yes, it comes 
pretty much down to that. Are you okay with carrying Kairi?” Aerith asked her, quite busy 
herself, carrying Yuffie whom was still unconscious.</p><p>Olette sighed and looked back. 
The town was still frozen and even Aerith didn't have any explanation why. Her only guess 
had been that someone set the town to a frozen state because of the intruders, that is, the 
Organization XIII and Kairi, Yuffie and herself.</p><p>There wasn't much of a choice now. 
There had been too much weird stuff happening lately to just return to a everyday life. At 
least not now.<br>The unconscious girl that was resting on her back, the woman in pink that 
was now telling her to walk through some sort of portal she had never seen before, and yet 
another girl, that was also unconscious and carried by Aerith, all that was just too much to 
comprehend here and now.</p><p>Her mind demanded a explanation of what was going on, and she 
would only get that when she would go with those people. So, not much of a choice on that 
matter.</p><p>“I hope you're right and this really leads to another world and isn't just... 
whatever it is and leaves me in the darkness,” Olette sighed and stepped towards the portal. 
Standing right in front of it, she could feel a slight chilly atmosphere streaming from it. 
That didn't make this any better.</p><p>“It is completely harmless. It could be a bit cold 
compared to the heat here,” Aerith said and stepped behind Olette.</p><p>The brunette wasn't 
sure this was a good idea but took the final step forward anyway. It didn't feel any 
different than doing a regular step, but she was now standing on a narrow path of light, 
completely surrounded by darkness and the stars.</p><p>“So.. this is one of the paths that 
connect worlds? Are you using those often?” she asked while doing another set of 
steps.</p><p>Aerith was close behind her, and just as she had stepped through the portal, it 
closed itself, leaving no trace of it in the frozen Twilight Town.</p><p>“Kairi uses them 
when she travels from world to world. You see, Kairi has been doing this for quite a while, 
and is looking for her friends. But that is a story you should really hear from her,” Aerith 
explained and kept a short distance to the girl.</p><p>Although this gateway had been secure 
when they first arrived in this world, there was no saying that there were no Heartless 
lurking in the darkness this time.</p><p>“Say... who were these guys? You called them 
Organization something,” Olette asked the woman walking behind her.</p><p>“Organization 
XIII. The Nobodies. Nobodies. We don't know much yet, but they seem to be after something 
special. And I think the chosen of<br>the Keyblade plays a significant role in their 
scheme.”</p><p>A short pause occurred. Olette didn't understand why Aerith called them 
“Nobodies,” but decided not to ask now.</p><p>“But they're not the only ones after the 
Keyblade. There are the Heartless, creatures of the endless darkness. We don't know how and 
why someone is chosen by the Keyblade, and I fear the heartless will now also try to capture 
your Keyblade. I'm not sure why you wield one at all, since the legend said never anything 
about more than one chosen.”</p><p>This made even less sense. The heartless? How could 
something like that even exist?</p><p>“But I wonder why the Heartless didn't find you. They 
lust after the Keyblade, yet fear it. It must have something to do with this strange world 
you were living in.”</p><p>The way seemed practically endless for Aerith, and all those 
mysteries didn't make it better.</p><p>“Why was the Organization in that world? What were 
they after? It didn't look like they wanted you or us. We were merely to the wrong time on 
the wrong place.”</p><p>Olette was lost. This was too much info at once. It had been the 
longest day ever for her, and she wasn't particularly happy about that. The glass tower... 
the silver and black... but those black things, were that the Heartless Aerith was speaking 
about? And then... those men with the black coats.</p><p>“I need report this to Leon and Cid 
as soon as I can. And...”</p><p>Aerith looked at the girl in front of her. She was about the 
same age as Kairi. She knew how hard it was for Kairi to grew accustomed to be a chosen of 
the Keyblade. Now, Olette had appeared and even wielded two Keyblades. Aerith didn't want to 
drag yet another girl in their battle against the Heartless, but there wasn't much of a 
choice. Wielding a Keyblade came with great danger for one self and the world one was 
living. But she couldn't bring herself to explain this to Olette.</p><p>“How long is this 
path? I have the feeling we've been walking for hours.”</p><p>Olette sighed and looked 
behind her. If she didn't count Aerith, there was nothing but darkness there. The portal to 
her world must have been closed or something.</p><p>“We're almost there. Since Kairi is 
still unconscious, I need you to open the portal to our world,” Aerith said.</p><p>“But I 
don't see anything here. Are you sure?” Olette wondered.</p><p>“Yes, I am sure. We're almost 
there. Look on the ground. You should see a little keyhole somewhere ahead. That is the sign 
that there is a world with a gateway there.”</p><p>Aerith was worried if Olette could manage 
opening a portal on her own yet.</p><p>“What would happen if we miss it?”</p><p>That was one 
of these questions one shouldn't ask.</p><p>“We would, somewhere on this path, find another 
keyhole I think. But we could walk days or forever and not find one. Most of those paths end 
in nothingness and darkness. But don't worry, a Keyblade master can feel where a keyhole is 
located.”</p><p>“I don't feel anything,” Olette responded.</p><p>“Only Kairi can really 
explain how it works, I fear. I only asked her once how she notices those things, and the 
best way she could explain it was intuition. For now, we can only hope that you really will 
notice it. But I trust you.”</p><p>That didn't particularly put Olette at ease. What if she 
really missed it?</p><p>With all her remaining concentration looking down on the ground and 
even slowing down a bit, Olette looked for something that looked like a keyhole.</p><p>“It 
should be around here somewhere. The gateway compass from Cid signalizes that a keyhole is 
pretty close. Now it's up to you. Only you can see the keyhole” Aerith said to 
Olette.</p><p>And there it was. Olette saw something really tiny on the ground. It looked 
like just another star that was glimmering in the darkness and shining through the path of 
light.</p><p>“I found it. What do I now?” she called out to Aerith.</p><p>“Summon your 
Keyblade and, from here on I can only tell you how Kairi described it once to me. 
Concentrate on it and try to open it.”</p><p>That was much easier said than done. Let alone 
summoning her Keyblade, Olette had not the glimpse of a idea how she would do that, but 
opening this... portal keyhole thing was over the top. How was she supposed to do 
that?</p><p>First, she had to lay down Kairi. It was impossible to do anything while 
carrying her piggyback. Aerith did the same with Yuffie, probably assuming that this could 
take a while.</p><p>“I guess summoning the weapons works the same way like dismissing,” 
Olette said to herself and closed her eyes.</p><p>Olette took both pendants that she had 
affixed on her trousers when they had left the mansion in her hands and took a deep 
breath.</p><p>She could remember well what the weapons looked like. The golden one, her own, 
and the one she had borrowed from Kairi, the silver-like one.<br>Picturing those in her 
mind, she simply thought of how the pendants would change shape. But that wasn't enough 
apparently.</p><p>Both pendants didn't move an inch. They looked exactly the same as before. 
But it was probably too much to ask to have it work on the first try.</p><p>“Isn't there 
some trick to this? It doesn't seem to work for me,” Olette complained.</p><p>Aerith didn't 
have any answer on that but walked right next to her. Laying her a hand on the hands of the 
girl, Aerith explained with a somewhat reassuring voice.</p><p>“Close your eyes, picture 
your Keyblade, try it with one at a time only and ask the Keyblade to take its true form for 
you. I think that is how Kairi does it,” Aerith said and stepped back.</p><p>Olette closed 
her eyes again and did how Aerith had instructed.</p><p>This time...</p><p 
align='center'>--Valiant Hearts--</p><p>“So, I found her virtually falling out of a portal 
like the ones the Organization uses near the mar. Someone want to explain to me who she is? 
She tells me the whole time that she knows Kairi and is looking for her.”</p><p>Tifa was one 
inch short of snapping. Not only were Aerith and Kairi more than six hours late, no, on top 
of that she had found this girl near the mar. To make that worse, she had come out of a 
portal of darkness, and even then, she had been wielding a Keyblade.</p><p>The only thing 
that Tifa had gotten out of her was that her name was Naminè and she was looking for Kairi. 
Apparently she knew her and as proof of that showed Tifa the Keyblade.</p><p>Of course she 
had recognized that Keyblade. It was Monochrome, one of Kairi's Keyblades</p><p>Unable to 
make a decision as to believe her or not, she brought the girl to Merlin's house, and on the 
way bumped into Leon and Cid, who were just coming back from a experiment. Leon looked quite 
demolished, but Tifa didn't care at all.</p><p>Cid had downright drowned her in questions 
when he noticed Naminè, but Tifa was completely unable to give any answers.</p><p>Right now, 
they were all in Merlin's house, Naminè sitting in a chair on the other end of the room, the 
Keyblade Monochrome on her lap, and looking a bit confused.</p><p>Tifa had gotten really 
angry when she didn't want to explain from where she knew Kairi and why she knew all their 
names.</p><p>“So, you're telling me just to believe her and let her walk around like it's 
nothing? You've got to be kidding me Leon! First, she wields a Keyblade. On top of that, 
this was once Kairi's Keyblade, Monochrome. It is weird enough that she is able to wield it. 
Second, Kairi and Aerith are six hours, Leon, six hours!, overdue and now she appears all of 
a sudden? And to make all this worse, she claims to know Kairi, knows from somewhere all 
ours names<br>and even refuses to tell me where she is from and from where she knows Kairi. 
You can't seriously tell me that-” Tifa got cut off by Leon.</p><p>“Calm down Tifa, calm 
down. I know it's hard for you right now to think clearly but we can't have you wreak havoc 
now. We're all worried about<br>Kairi, Aerith and Yuffie, but you're jumping to 
conclusions,” Leon said with a completely calm voice.</p><p>Tifa was about to beat Leon to a 
pulp. How could he say that to her despite what had happened the last few days?</p><p>Naminè 
in the meanwhile had stood up and was now standing right next to Tifa. She certainly didn't 
look like a spy of the Organization or something like that. That she was able to wield a 
Keyblade fortified that fact.</p><p>“Kairi is in this world. I can feel her,” she said to 
Tifa, whose eyes got wide and mouth stood open.</p><p>“If that's just a cheap lie to get out 
of here then, girl, you better be prepared for the worst,” Tifa snapped at her and ran 
off.</p><p>Leon and Cid, both looked at Naminè with great eyes. Who in the world was that 
girl?</p><p align='center'>--Valiant Hearts--</p><p>“See, you can do it. Wasn't so hard, was 
it?”</p><p>Aerith gave Olette a smile and looked at the open gateway.</p><p>She had managed 
to successfully materialize her own Keyblade and open the gateway. It wasn't that hard when 
she concentrated on just one Keyblade. Opening the portal worked itself out without much 
trouble.</p><p>“This... world looks kind of gloomy,” Olette said as she looked 
around.</p><p>“Not at all. We have a very nice town not far from here. This is just the 
portal that is used to travel to your world.”</p><p>“Say... what is that dust cloud that's 
rushing at us?” asked Olette slightly scared.</p><p>“Oh my god, that's Tifa. Fast, stand 
behind me,” Aerith told the girl and took a deep breath.</p><p>“Tifa!! We're back! Don't 
worry, we're okay!”</p><p>Aerith shouted and as if her words were some sort of break, the 
dust cloud got slower until Olette could see that it was a black dressed woman that had been 
running towards them with an amazing speed.</p><p>“Aerith, god I was so worried.” Tifa 
didn't lose any time and embraced Aerith.</p><p>Tifa, worried sick, didn't even notice that 
Aerith had been carrying Yuffie nor that Olette was standing right behind Aerith. Tifa 
practically forced<br>Aerith in a close embrace and even closer kiss, but Aerith couldn't 
and probably didn't want to put up any resistance.</p><p>Unable to hold Yuffie like that, 
Aerith dropped her and she fell on the rock hard ground. She was still unconscious and 
unable to moan out.</p><p>“Are you injured? Of course you are injured! Did the Organization 
attack you? I swear, I'm going to tear them apart the next time... Where is Kairi? Is Kairi 
okay?” Tifa blurted out and looked around.</p><p>“She is okay, but I need to heal her. Can 
you... uhm... let me go? I'm really happy to be back, but we're all really tired.” Aerith 
tried to put Tifa a bit at ease.</p><p>Tifa had noticed the other girl that was carrying 
Kairi. If not for Aerith, she would have tried to get some answers out of that girl. But 
that was not the only problem. That girl was wielding a Keyblade Tifa had never seen before. 
And she knew all of Kairi's.</p><p>“That girl is wielding a Keyblade? Aerith, what in the 
world happened over there? I really love you and trust you blind, but you really need to 
explain this,” complained Tifa to her girlfriend.</p><p>Olette stood there with an open 
mouth. Sure, the concept of homosexual people was not new to her, but to see one with her 
own eyes was certainly different.</p><p>“Her name is Olette... let me get some rest and I 
will explain everything to you. There is a lot to explain. But I need to treat Kairi first, 
and Yuffie could also need some proper rest. Olette is surely also complete worn out,” 
Aerith told her lover and freed herself from her embrace.</p><p>After she picked up Yuffie, 
Tifa had closely examined Olette and Kairi in the meanwhile, the little group walked towards 
the town.</p><p>Tifa had completely forgotten about Naminè for the moment.</p><p>“Your name 
is Olette?” she started a conversation with the brunette.</p><p>“Hm. And you're Tifa? That 
is if what Aerith shouted just now is your name?”</p><p>“Yeah, I'm Tifa. Let's hear your 
story. How come you wield a Keyblade, and you suddenly show up with Aerith and Kairi 
here?”</p><p>Aerith gave her lover a cold glare.</p><p>“Don't bombard her with questions 
Tifa. I also have questions for her, but that has to wait until she gets some rest. She and 
Kairi apparently fought alone against one of the members of the Organization. And it didn't 
seem like it was a weak member. I'm really grateful to her. So give your curiosity a break, 
will you?”</p><p>Although it had a serious tone, she gave Tifa a smile and was happy to see 
her.</p><p>The little group was halfway up to the living quarter when Tifa offered to also 
carry Kairi. It was no big deal for her, but Olette didn't mind carrying Kairi at 
all.</p><p>It took them, exhausted as they were, almost half a hour to reach the living 
quarter where Leon and Cid were waiting outside of Merlin's house.</p><p>Leon tried to stop 
Aerith, but Tifa gave him a killing glare.</p><p>“They need some rest. We'll explain 
everything after that,” she fired at Leon and ignored his objection.</p><p>Their house was 
not too far from where Merlin's house was, and for the time being, they would also take 
Yuffie and Olette there.</p><p>Depleted and exhausted, Aerith sat down on the couch and 
while Tifa was busy placing Yuffie on another couch, Olette looked around.</p><p>It was a 
nice place, but she still had some trouble to imagine that those two woman were not only a 
couple but also lived apparently here together.</p><p>“Olette dear, lay Kairi down next to 
me. I'll treat her wounds first.”</p><p>Olette followed Aerith's plea and laid the redhead 
on the couch, her head resting on Aerith's lap.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, focusing her 
mind, Aerith started to treat the wounds of her adoptive daughter.</p><p>“Great saint of the 
holy kingdom, let their ordeal come to an end and gift them with your blessing. Grant me 
your power and might and let me pass<br>them down to cure what I hold dear.”</p><p>Aerith 
finished her recitation and a really bright, dazzling light emitted from her hands and 
covered slowly Kairi's whole body.</p><p>“That's the strongest healing magic we know of. 
Aerith calls it Erzengel. Thats an very old word in the ancient language of the world we 
come originally from and means Arch Angel,” explained Tifa.</p><p>“I never heard of people 
using magic like that,” said Olette and continued to observe Aerith.</p><p>The light slowly 
ceased and where previously there had been wounds from the intense battle, there was nothing 
left. That was a truly amazing skill.</p><p>“How did she do that?” Olette asked 
Tifa.</p><p>“Magic. It's a natural thing. Kairi is capable of some magic herself but not 
even close to what Aerith is capable of. I don't use magic much although I'm quite skilled. 
Not as much as Aerith, though.”</p><p>Tifa walked over to Aerith and picked Kairi up. Aerith 
was obviously even more exhausted than before. Such amazing magic must put quite some stress 
on one's body.</p><p>“I'll get her in her room. Her body is now fine, but her mind needs 
some rest too.” Tifa said to Olette and went upstairs.</p><p>“I fear you won't be able to 
rest right now Olette. Leon won't just sit idly by and leave you alone. We need to at least 
explain to him who you are.”</p><p>Olette didn't really want to go through any more 
explaining. Her head was quite hurting from all this and she only wanted some 
sleep.</p><p>In that very moment knocked someone on the door.</p><p align='center'>--Valiant 
Hearts--</p><p>“This world is perfect for a little game. It reminds me somewhat of the world 
my original came from.”</p><p>A man, completely covered in a black coat, was standing on the 
pier of a big haven.</p><p>With just the wink of his hand, a massive Heartless rose from the 
ground. This world was the perfect playground for him. It was only a matter of time until 
the Keyblade's chosen would arrive here. They would fetch many, many hearts for him. But it 
would be too boring if he just flooded the world with Heartless.</p><p>“I think it is time 
to make use of the code.”</p><p>The man turned around, lifted both arms and spoke one simple 
word.</p><p>“Parley.”</p><p align='center'>--Valiant Hearts--</p><p>“I'm getting a 
headache.”</p><p>Tifa was standing in the midst of her own living room and didn't understand 
the world anymore.</p><p>For the longest of all times, they searched for the chosen of the 
Keyblade and found Kairi. Now, after a single trip to another world, there were suddenly 
three of them.</p><p>“Wait, wait wait wait a moment! Your name is Naminè, right?” Tifa got a 
short nod from the blond girl.</p><p>“And you're Olette. You're from Twilight Town, and 
Naminè doesn't know where she's from.”</p><p>Two girls gave her another nod.</p><p>Tifa 
scuffled her hair, seemingly quite annoyed.</p><p>“Aerith, I'm going to check on Kairi, I'll 
let you handle this.”</p><p>The living room, that was definitely not designed to fit that 
many, was filled with people.</p><p>Leon and Cid, bringing along Naminè, had been curious 
who the unknown girl was that had been carrying Kairi. Now, they found out that it was yet 
another chosen of the Keyblade.</p><p>“Tis' feels like a bad joke from Destiny, don'tcha 
think?” grumbled Cid and looked desperately for a chair or something to sit 
down.</p><p>“Calm down, all of you. No one here had a easy day and if you absolutely insist 
on doing this now, we will do this in a calm manner.”</p><p>Aerith didn't like this much. 
She wasn't in the best of the moods and quite exhausted on top of that.</p><p>“The facts 
first,” Leon started.</p><p>He went over to where Naminè was sitting and looked at 
her.</p><p>“Tell us how you got that Keyblade and where you came from. We don't know 
anything but that your name is Naminè.”</p><p>The blond girl gave Leon a curious 
look.</p><p>“I don't know. I just woke one day up in that weird town and started looking 
around. I don't even know what I was looking for. Then Axel found me.<br>He brought me 
somewhere. I don't remember where.” She started to tell her story.</p><p>Leon sighed and 
looked over to Aerith, who only gave him a slightly annoyed look.</p><p>“Who is this Axel?” 
Leon asked.</p><p>“Axel is a kind guy that saved me from the Organization. We escaped 
together but the Organization hunted him because he ignored the orders of someone. That is 
what he told me.”</p><p>The room was dead silent. Axel, a member of the Organization had 
helped her?</p><p>“Where is this Axel now?” Leon asked again.</p><p>“I... don't know. I was 
in that mansion when Axel suddenly came rushed in and told me we have to escape. It was 
really loud out there. He opened a portal and brought me to another place with another 
portal. He promised we would meet again.”</p><p>The atmosphere got really weird after she 
finished her talk.</p><p>“You don't know? Why did he help you? What is your relation to-” 
Leon was cut off.</p><p>“Make a point Leon. She obviously told you what she knows,” said an 
annoyed Aerith.</p><p>“But we need-”</p><p>“What do you gain when you force her? She is able 
to wield a Keyblade, and the Organization hunted this Axel down because he betrayed them. So 
she is obviously not a enemy.”</p><p>“Aerith this is not-”</p><p>“Leon!”</p><p>Leon took a 
step back. It was really rare that Aerith got loud, but that was a sure sign that she was 
serious about this. He had no choice but to back off for now. When thinking about it, Aerith 
really did have a point. The Organization wouldn't hunt one of their members for 
naught.</p><p>“Your name is Aerith, right?”</p><p>Naminè was standing right next to 
her.</p><p>“Yes dear. Don't mind him. This is how he shows that he is concerned about 
us.”</p><p>“Oh, that's okay. The people at the Organization were much much 
worse.”</p><p>“Are you tired?”</p><p>Leon felt completely alienated. But he was already 
somewhat used to this.</p><p>“Not very. Can I see Kairi? I want her to thank for the visit 
the other day.”</p><p>Aerith was puzzled. The visit the other day? When did 
Kairi...</p><p>“Now I know who you are!”</p><p>Everyone in the room was looking at 
Olette.</p><p>She had been pondering about something the whole time. She had seem that girl 
before. Olette was absolutely sure that she had seen her somewhere before. But 
where?</p><p>“On that glass tower! You're the girl that was right next to Kairi. Now that I 
think about it, that Keyblade ornament was also the same!”</p><p>Leon sighed. This was 
getting more complicated by the second. He couldn't even follow everything anymore. Who in 
the world were those two girls?<br>One seemed to be from the world Kairi and Aerith just had 
visited, while the other one didn't know where she was from. On top of that, the 
Organization had been shown up in both stories.</p><p>“Kairi, you need to rest. You 
shouldn't even be up!” Tifa was getting loud. Everyone in the living room could hear her 
talk upstairs.</p><p>Just moments later, Kairi appeared on the top stair and slowly walked 
down.</p><p>“I'm fine. Aerith healed me anyway. Beside, I can't sleep with that ruckus down 
here anyway.”</p><p>Naminè wanted to immediately go over to Kairi, but it seemed like Kairi 
didn't recognize her at all. It wasn't that weird, as Kairi had never really seen her. But 
there was one thing that Kairi would surely remember.</p><p>Naminè looked at her palm, and 
for a second recalled their meeting in Castle Oblivion. Kairi would know immediately who she 
was. Naminè could hardly wait, it was the first time she felt so excited, but she had to 
wait for the right moment.</p><p>Kairi immediately recognized Olette, but had no idea who 
the blond girl was. There was something familiar about her, as if she knew her long ago, but 
she couldn't say where she belonged to.</p><p>“Leon. This girl here is Olette. She is from 
the world we were just visiting. I think the town is the core part of that world. It is 
called Twilight Town,”<br>Kairi started her report.</p><p>Olette didn't understand what 
Kairi was saying. Core part?</p><p>“That world's name is most likely also Twilight Town. 
Let's keep it at that. We fought a member of the Organization. He was using a big sword and 
berserker techniques. From what I heard about the other day, no one of us fought him before. 
Olette showed up in the middle of the fight and fought the Organization XIII member with me. 
I got knocked out and don't know what happened after, but since Olette isn't seriously 
injured I think he left shortly after that. She is able to wield two Keyblades and even 
maintain both of them. You all know that I tried using the same technique a while back but 
wasn't able to do it. She is able to.”</p><p>Kairi finished her report and sat down right 
beside Aerith.</p><p>“That explains one of them. Do you know anything about her?” Leon 
pointed at Naminè.</p><p>Kairi hadn't heard that her name was Naminè yet, so she just shook 
her head. She didn't recognize that face, nor did she know why that girl was wielding 
Monochrome, which was originally her Keyblade.</p><p>Naminè knelt down in front of Kairi 
and, with a slight smile, imitated the scene from when Kairi meet her at the top level of 
castle oblivion.</p><p>“Do you remember?”</p><p>Tifa, still standing on the lowest stair, 
did a short gasp. What in the world was that girl doing? Aerith didn't seem to mind and had 
to grin slightly.<br>Kairi had been a bit distanced to people of her age ever since Sora and 
Riku had been imprisoned in Kingdom Hearts.</p><p>“Na... Naminè?!” Kairi gasped and 
completed the imitation by laying her hand on Naminè's cheek.</p><p>Naminè now smiled, truly 
happy, and was looking at Kairi. She had wished for this to happen, had wished to look in 
her eyes and have her look back.</p><p>Kairi, getting a hold of herself, looked at Leon. It 
wasn't a secret from his cold glare that he didn't trust the girl.</p><p>“She is... I don't 
know exactly what she is, but definitely not a enemy. She was imprisoned on top of some 
castle I found when we raided the Organization headquarters the other day. I couldn't see 
her back then, but I remember the feeling of this hand. I don't know why she is able to 
wield a Keyblade that was originally mine, but Olette can also wield Hero's Crest, which 
belonged to me. If you don't trust her, you don't trust me Leon.”</p><p>With that, she laid 
her own hand on Naminè's and had to smile. She was a bit going overboard when she said that 
last part but truly felt like Naminè was definitely someone close to her.</p><p>“That's 
enough for today. Naminè, Olette, you can stay here for the night. Kairi dear, you really 
need to take some rest. I can see you're tired just from looking at you. Be a nice girl and 
take some sleep.”</p><p>Aerith looked over to Tifa who was still standing near the 
stairs.</p><p>“Tifa, can you do me the favor and carry Yuffie over to her apartment? And 
Leon, Cid, I think this is enough for today.”</p><p>Aerith stood up and walked over to where 
Yuffie was laying on the other couch. She had to heal her at least with a Curega spell 
before Tifa carried Yuffie to her own apartment.</p><p>“People of the light, give me your 
blessing! Hear my call to protect what is dear to me,” she recited and a white light 
streamed all over the body of the ninja.</p><p>Leon had no choice but to leave now. Tifa 
would most likely snap if he strained her patience anymore than this.</p><p>Cid didn't care 
as much as Leon did, and had already left.</p><p>Kairi was tired to no end and was half 
asleep sitting on the couch. This had been too much of a long day. The fight with the 
Organization member<br>was bad enough. But now, all of a sudden, Naminè appeared out of 
nowhere in Hollow Bastion. She wanted to ask a lot of questions but was too tired for 
now.</p><p>Olette didn't feel so good either. A real battle for one's life put some strains 
on one. The fact that she could have been killed that time didn't fully get to her. She was 
right now in another world, only barely knew two of those people and didn't understand a 
single thing they were talking about.<br>For now, she only wanted to get some sleep. She was 
infinitely tired.</p><p>Naminè on the other hand didn't feel very tired. She hadn't had to 
fight at all. On the keyhole path had been another portal. Ones of the kind that Axel used. 
She didn't know what to look out for beside that one, so she took the direct approach and 
walked through it. After that, she immediately meet Tifa and was brought to the town. But 
now that she had met Kairi again, and even more, was allowed to sleep in the same house than 
she, it didn't matter much to her that they were all tired. There was still a 
tomorrow.</p><p>“You two can sleep in the room right next to Kairi's. We don't use that room 
the most time but it is somewhat of a guest room I think. I hope you both don't have any 
issues with each other. We only have that one room free,” Tifa talked to Olette and 
Naminè.</p><p>“I don't even know her, how should I have issues with her?” Olette replied and 
looked at Naminè.</p><p>That girl didn't even listen to Tifa. She was sitting right next to 
Kairi and gazing at her, while Kairi was almost sleeping.</p><p>“Naminè was it, hm?” Olette 
sat down next to the blond.</p><p>“Hmm, yes. And you're Olette?” Naminè replied without 
letting lose of her view.</p><p>“Yeah. What are you looking at?” Olette was a bit 
puzzled.</p><p>It was somewhat obvious what Naminè was looking at, but Olette still couldn't 
help but to ask.</p><p>“Don't you think she has a pretty face?” asked Naminè, a bit 
surprised.</p><p>“What? I mean... yeah, she is somewhat pretty but... what are you saying? 
You're gazing at her this whole time because she is pretty?”</p><p>Olette was a bit 
confused. It seemed that it was normal here for one girl to stare at another just like 
that.</p><p>“It's maybe a bit dusty but your room is ready. Just up the stairs and the first 
room left. The bathroom is the first room on the right side. Can you carry Kairi to her 
room? I need to carry that useless ninja over there to her apartment,” Tifa sighed and 
without waiting for an answer walked over to where Yuffie was laying.</p><p>Kairi had 
already fallen asleep. Aerith had vanished somewhere upstairs. She looked rather pale when 
Olette last saw her. Tifa had also left, carrying Yuffie to her apartment. The three were 
all alone.</p><p>Naminè had stopped gazing at Kairi and was already on her way upstairs. The 
only one left in the living room was Olette. And, of course, the sleeping Kairi.</p><p>“Just 
what is so cute about her face?” Olette wondered and knelt right next to Kairi.</p><p>The 
redhead had fallen asleep almost right after she had concluded her report. Leaning back, 
looking quite peaceful while sleeping, Kairi had her mouth slightly open and just seemed to 
wait for a prince to wake her up.</p><p>Without really knowing why she was doing it, Olette 
laid her hand on Kairi's cheek, sweeping a few hairs that had fallen in her face behind her 
ear.<br>The sun was setting over the town and bathed the room in a dark red, making the 
atmosphere even weirder than before. Before she knew it, Olette had laid both hands on 
Kairi's shoulders and had moved her own face so close to Kairi's that she could feel her 
breath.</p><p>Olette felt a sudden rise of tension, like she did something that was not 
allowed and didn't want to get caught. It was... weird to just watch Kairi laying there 
while she was sleeping. Was it that what Naminè had been doing? Watching her like that? 
But...</p><p>She really was pretty. Olette didn't want to admit it, but this was the first 
time ever that she did think that someone else's face was really pretty.</p><p>“You really 
are making my head feel weird, Kairi...” she muttered.</p><p>It wasn't all that bad to feel 
like that. But that it was a girl that gave her that feeling was really unexpected. There 
wasn't any bias against people that liked the same gender in Twilight Town, but Olette just 
couldn't think of it as right. She couldn't see Hayner and Pence, or any other guy, as 
someone to be interested in, in that way. Olette didn't want to tell anyone about that. It 
made her really embarrassed to talk about things like that.</p><p>“Olette? What are you 
doing?” Naminè was calling from upstairs.</p><p>With a huge shock, realizing what she had 
been doing, Olette virtually jumped from the couch and tried to gather her thoughts. She 
didn't feel anything particular about Kairi, so what had just happened?</p><p>“I must be 
really tired...” Olette sighed and shook her head.</p><p>“Olette, you okay?”</p><p>Naminè 
had come down, standing rather close to Olette and gazing at her face. The brunette couldn't 
help but blush in that moment, with Naminè being so close to her. But nothing happened. 
Naminè didn't do anything beside letting out a small “hmm” and looked back at 
Kairi.</p><p>“Her face really is pretty. You think so too, don't you?” Naminè asked and 
turned around.</p><p>“Uh... yes, but... well, I don't really...” Olette 
stammered.</p><p>What kind of response should she give to that after doing something so 
obviously weird? She couldn't really say that she didn't care. That would just make her look 
embarrassed. She had to change the topic somehow. But what should they talk about? There 
happened so many things today but nothing particular came to mind.</p><p>“So you have a 
Keyblade too?” Olette asked.</p><p>“Yes. Kairi left me one after she found me at Oblivion 
Castle. I think it's called Monochrome. But I'm a total klutz with using it. And 
you?”</p><p>“I had my own but got another from Kairi. You see, the world I come from has a 
sport named struggle and-” Olette stopped when she realized that her own world had been 
still frozen when she left. Not only that, but it had been frozen in the middle of the 
struggle tournament.</p><p>Were the other people okay? Was the world okay? What if the guys 
in black had come back? Or the fire had taken over the town? Or the time had resumed and 
everyone noticed she was gone? How would she explain this to Hayner and Pence? “I just got 
into a life or death battle with some kind of Organization member and after that got to 
another world with some weird people that keep telling me I'm some chosen of the Keyblade?” 
The heck, nobody would believe that, not even Hayner.</p><p>“Olette? Are you okay? You look 
really pale” Naminè called her back into reality.</p><p>“Huh, what, oh... yes I just... 
remembered my own world. They will probably look for me and when they don't find me, they'll 
be worried,” Olette sighed and asked herself when they could go home.</p><p>“Don't worry. 
I'm sure Kairi will think of something.” Naminè gave her a small smile and looked outside 
the window.</p><p>“I sure hope so. I miss my friends.”</p><p>Naminè didn't know how to 
respond to that. She never had any friends beside Axel, and her only choice was to believe 
she would meet him again, to trust his words. Olette on the contrary seemed to have had 
friends, a family and a world she belonged to. While Naminè couldn't think of a reason she 
would want to leave Kairi's side, there were likely plenty for Olette.</p><p>From upstairs, 
they could hear the shower being used. The water gurgling could be heard in the living room. 
Both girls stood there, one looking outside the window, the other gazing in thin air, both 
lost in thoughts. None of them said anything until the water stopped and Kairi gave out loud 
yawn. Both Olette and Naminè immediately looked at Kairi and couldn't help but smile upon 
that.</p><p>“I'm going to bed. You two should too. I know Leon, and tomorrow is going to be 
a long, long day... especially for you two. Good night.”</p><p>Kairi went, without any 
further comment, upstairs and just seconds after, a loud shriek they could identify as 
Aerith's voice echoed through the house.</p><p>“I saw that one coming,” Olette said and put 
her palm on her forehead.</p><p>Naminè just giggled and slowly walked towards the stairs and 
went upstairs. For a moment, Olette was all alone in the living room. It seemed indefinitely 
bigger than before, when all those people had been there. She didn't even know all their 
names. Just Kairi, Naminè, Tifa and Aerith.</p><p>It was somewhat unbelievable what had 
happened in just one day. She was just hoping that there weren't any nasty surprises the 
next morning.<br>Olette had slowly come to terms that she truly had been fighting to 
survive. Had been fighting that man to live on. It was a really fearsome thought, but seeing 
how Kairi put up with it so easily, she didn't want to lose to her. It was childish and 
stupid, but Olette had been stubborn since forever and just didn't want to show that she was 
really frightened by the thought of fighting for one's life.</p><p>Upstairs rang a loud 
sound, as if something crashed or a locker had been knocked over. What was that Naminè girl 
doing? The shower didn't stop, so Aerith might not have heard it. Kairi was probably already 
asleep.</p><p>Olette gave another sigh and went upstairs, just to find Naminè covered in a 
huge amount of bed sheets, all over the place. That view was just too funny to hold in, and 
Olette just had to laugh on it. Naminè was sitting on the ground, with sheets all over her, 
making her look like one of those girls out of a horror movie.</p><p>The room was pretty 
much completely empty but a cabinet, a bunk bed and a mirror on the wall. Right over the bed 
was a window one could see the sky when laying down and the walls were painted with a pale 
brown tone.</p><p>“What are you doing, really?” Olette said with a really huge grin and went 
to free the struggling Naminè from the sheets.</p><p>“I thought I could put these on the 
beds. They're really really dusty but I tripped when I took them out of the cabinet.” Naminè 
defended the little pride she had in that situation.</p><p>It took several minutes but 
together, they put successfully a sheet on each bed and the rest of them back in the locker. 
Both of them were<br>sweating a lot since that room hadn't been used in ages and the air was 
very thin in there.</p><p>“I could use a shower too...” Olette moaned and picked on her 
clothes. They were downright soaked with dirt from that battle.</p><p>“Can I take the lower 
bed?” Naminè asked and looked expectantly over to the brunette.</p><p>“I don't mind. At home 
I'm sleeping in a bunk bed too, but there is no lower bed. I'll gag you if you snore, I warn 
you.” Olette pointed her finger towards Naminè and laughed at her surprised 
face.</p><p>“Don't worry. I doubt you'll snore and even so, I'm not going to gag you, 
really”</p><p>“You scared me there for a moment. But you really seem like a nice girl 
Olette,” Naminè said with a bright smile.</p><p>One second Olette had been looking on the 
ground from embarrassment, the next second a immense dust cloud filled the room. Naminè had 
jumped on one of the beds and stirred up all the dust. Olette immediately started coughing 
and had to run. The dust was so thick, they could hardly breath in there. Naminè came just 
seconds after her running out of the room.</p><p>“What are you two doing? Are you okay?” 
Aerith stood behind them, wrapped in several towels.</p><p>Naminè gazed a moment at her and 
noticed that Olette had turned around with bright red cheeks. Aerith really was beautiful 
but completely different from how Kairi was.</p><p>Aerith's hair was wrapped in a towel and 
turned up like a turban while the only thing that covered her bare skin was a long, white 
towel. There wasn't any particular reason for Olette to be embarrassed about that view, but 
she wasn't used to a woman walking around like that.</p><p>“It is just a bit dusty. But is 
it really okay that we take that room?” Naminè asked and looked curiously at 
Aerith.</p><p>“But sure. I think it is more than just coincidence that we all meet today. I 
will not call it fortunate but I'm happy to have you two here,” Aerith said and looked in 
the room.</p><p>It was dusty all over, and the air still very sweltering. That was no 
condition to have someone sleep in there. Aerith really didn't like using magic for such 
trivial matters, but she was too tired and it was already evening, so there it couldn't be 
helped.</p><p>“Grace of the gentle wind, come upon my will,” she recited quietly.</p><p>A 
huge gust of air streamed into the room, pushing the window open with force and dispersing 
the dust out of it. The room was still far from clean, but people would be able to sleep in 
there without any problem.</p><p>“This does the trick,” Aerith smiled at the two girls and 
was about to walk off to her own bedroom.</p><p>“Can you teach me that magic?” Naminè 
blurted out.</p><p>“You are interested in magic? Your name is Naminè, am I 
right?”</p><p>“Hm, yes. I'm no good with the Keyblade, and Axel taught me fire magic, so I 
was thinking if you don't have anything else to do-” Naminè was cut off.</p><p>Aerith laid a 
hand on her head and smiled on her. Tifa had no great interest in magic, and Kairi lacked 
the ability and talent for the greater spells. Maybe that girl was more gifted.</p><p>“Sure. 
But tomorrow will be a long day, so take a good rest today, okay?”</p><p>Olette had slowly 
walked away, back into their room, and it really was bearable now. The fresh air of the 
night sky - the sun had sunk in the meanwhile - was clearing her mind. What a day this had 
been. But it didn't feel so bad after all.</p><p>“Olette, Aerith said the shower is free. 
You said you wanted to shower, right?” Naminè said while standing behind her.</p><p>She 
hadn't had much of a troublesome day so it was okay to shower later. Olette on the other 
hand was still wearing her dirty clothes from before and didn't have any spare clothes. But 
Aerith had already thought of something and had given Naminè some spare clothes from Kairi 
for the two.</p><p>“Aerith really is kind, don't you think?” Naminè said while sitting on 
her bed, wiggling with her legs forth and back.</p><p>“She really is. That Tifa doesn't look 
as kind to me, but she has this... Dependant aura, I think. Like you can completely trust 
her.” Olette responded. “I'm going to take a shower now. I'll take the shorts and the shirt 
from the clothes. You okay with the dress?”</p><p>“Yeah, sure.”</p><p>“Don't stir up another 
dust cloud,” Olette said with a evil grin.</p><p>“I won't. I'll go and ask Kairi for some 
pencils and paper. I really like to draw and today a lot happened,” Naminè 
replied.</p><p>Olette left the room, followed by Naminè. It was weird. Olette didn't knew 
anything about this world, didn't knew the people there, didn't knew who and what they were 
fighting, and not even anything about Kairi. But yet, she really felt a little bit like at 
home there.</p><p>Naminè knew. She knew their names, what they were fighting, a few details 
about their everyday lives, their relationships and even about this world. She had seen so 
much in her dreams that connected her with Kairi but to see this all by herself was truly 
something else. To be able to touch Kairi, to feel her hand on her cheek, to be so close to 
her.</p><p>Naminè could hear the shower being turned on, and knocked on the door that led to 
Kairi's room. It had a sign that said “Kairi's Room” on it. But the girl didn't answer. 
There was no response at all. Naminè knocked again and there was again no 
response.</p><p>Slowly, Naminè opened the door. The room was just like she had remembered. 
This room, she had seen it so many times in her dreams. It had a certain smell she didn't 
know from the dreams, a special sensation that only one could feel if really 
there.</p><p>Kairi was laying on her bed, the legs and arms stretched out, still dressed and 
quietly breathing. In the same manner as before, her mouth was slightly open and her head 
turned towards the room side of the bed.</p><p>Naminè walked past the desk and knelt right 
beside the bed. One of her arms was hanging from it, and the blond just wanted to hold her 
hand for a moment. All the time, she had thought about how it would feel to do that. How it 
would feel to hold the hand of the girl she thought so much about.</p><p>Taking her hand, 
Naminè felt weird. It was as if memories were flowing into her, no, it was more like they 
were being recalled. Things she never saw in Kairi's dreams, things that happened long ago 
were appearing before her. It stopped after a few seconds, but it gave Naminè a really weird 
feeling.<br>As if a part of her she had lost and forgotten about was being 
restored.</p><p>Kairi moved in her sleep and Naminè was forced to let her hand go, but in 
exchange sat on the edge of the bed and again gazed at Kairi's face She never really had any 
contact with people but Axel. It was perfectly normal for her to be like this, being drawn 
to Kairi, the girl she had longed for in her dreams, the girl she thought about when she was 
alone. It didn't occur in the slightest to her that it was weird for normal people to do 
things like this.</p><p>With a slight smile, Naminè bent over Kairi, her hair almost 
tickling the face of the redhead. She just couldn't stop thinking about her. It hadn't been 
that way when Kairi had come for her. It was different from back then. Although she didn't 
know how, it that was of little issue for her. It was a weird feeling and Naminè didn't even 
attempt to try and explain this for herself. She just took it as it was and didn't think a 
moment about if this was right or wrong.</p><p>“You really make a cute face when you're 
sleeping, Kairi. I really... like...it... like... that...”</p><p>With each word, the girl 
bent lower and lower. Her hair was tickling Kairi's face, her neck, her lips. Not even a 
hand length was separating the two anymore. About to fall over, Naminè placed both hands 
right next to the shoulders of the girl that was sleeping so peacefully. Closing her own 
eyes, she got even closer, could feel the breath of the redhead on her lips, could feel her 
chest moving under with each breath. It was just a little distance between her and Kairi's 
lips, so very little that Naminè could feel a special tension rising in her 
head.</p><p>“Naminè, where are you? I'm done showering!” Olette called through the 
house.</p><p>Called back like that into reality, Naminè realized where she was; deep bent 
over Kairi, having almost kissed her. She hadn't intended to do that. It was a nice 
sensation Naminè had felt when she was so close to Kairi.</p><p>Without completing her 
objective, and with slightly red cheeks, Naminè left the room and got back to her 
room.</p><p>“Where were you? Did you find what you looked for?” Olette asked, drying her 
hair with a towel.</p><p>She already wore the clothes that Aerith had given her. It didn't 
fit so well but for now it was better than her dirty clothes. The shirt was a bit too tight 
on the chest but the shorts were fitting quite well.</p><p>“I couldn't find them. Kairi is 
already sleeping so I had to look alone. I'll go and take a shower now.”</p><p>Olette looked 
a bit puzzled about the different behavior to before, but maybe it was just her imagination. 
She didn't know anything about Naminè, so there wasn't really anything she could 
say.</p><p>Now that she'd had a shower, and Naminè was taking one, there was nothing to do. 
Aerith had vanished into her own bedroom, and Tifa seemed to be still outside. Olette didn't 
even remember what it was that Tifa was doing.</p><p>The room was just empty and after 
taking a shower, she didn't feel like immediately sleeping. It must been already past ten 
and it was dark out.</p><p>How did all this happen? She was right here, in another world, 
had met both of the girls she had seen on the ornaments on the glass tower, had fought for 
her life, met some really weird people and had learned far more than she had ever wanted to 
know. But now, there were even more questions. What was she doing here? Was this all a 
coincidence? Why was she able to summon one of those weapons? Her pendant, her beloved 
keepsake had been one of these weapons all along. Was this... fate?</p><p>“Fate or not, I 
want to go back to Twilight Town. I miss Hayner and Pence... when I'll be able to go back to 
a normal life.”</p><p>A normal life. Training for the next struggle tournament. Working at 
the accessory shop. Playing with Hayner and Pence. Boring days that just wouldn't end. All 
that seemed so far away that she couldn't reach it.</p><p>Olette held her keepsake, the 
Keyblade pendant, in her hand and looked at it. It didn't seem any different from before. 
Did this really transform into a weapon? She could hardly believe it. And what were all 
those stories about the chosen of the Keyblade, the Heartless or whatever they were called, 
the Nobodies and what not.</p><p>“I wonder if Kairi is forced to do this. Aerith and Tifa 
really seem like nice people, but... why would anyone fight those things voluntarily? I 
don't understand it...”</p><p>It wasn't a pleasant feeling to fight that Organization 
member. It was not even exciting. Olette had been really scared in the end, having realized 
that this wasn't just about winning or losing a game. If one lost, one lost his life. That 
was too high a price.</p><p>“Why did they come to my world?... My world... that sounds like 
I've been to a dozen others. I'm already talking like it's normal to know that there are 
many worlds. But... I'm a little bit curious how other worlds look.”</p><p>Olette hadn't 
noticed that the noise from the shower had stopped. How long had she talked to herself? 
Turning around, she laid on her back and looked through the window. There were so many 
stars. Was every star out there really a world? Was her own world one of the stars she could 
see right now? Olette had never dreamed of this. Never dreamed to go to another 
world.</p><p>If it had been under other circumstances, maybe... just maybe, she could have 
really enjoyed this.</p><p>Naminè had entered the room. Her hair was still wet and steaming 
from the hot water. Naminè had already changed into the dress from Kairi; she didn't want to 
sleep in her usual clothes.</p><p>“I wonder where Tifa is,” Naminè said.</p><p>“I don't 
know. But I'm really tired and my head hurts. I'm going to sleep,” Olette replied.</p><p>“I 
think thats a good idea. I'm going to turn off the lights.”</p><p>“Please do.”</p><p>Just 
seconds later, the room was wrapped in darkness. Only a bit of light from the stars was 
shining through the window. Olette looked a last time at the night sky and was thinking of 
her own world. Naminè held on the Monochrome pendant and put it under her 
pillow.</p><p>“Good night Olette.”</p><p>“You too, good night Naminè.”</p>
