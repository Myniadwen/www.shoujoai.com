Bond We Share</I></P><P>Almost
a week passed by without any sign of Kairi. They had found out that
there were hundreds of little islands Kairi could been on. Even if
they had a boat, it would take months to search them all.</P><P>Food
was hard to come by. Olette had been providing it most of the time,
but for the last few days, they both skipped breakfast and dinner,
even if it only consisted of bread and some fruits the previous day.
Living only off water was much harder than they had ever imagined.</P><P>Their
hideout had been found out and they could not go back. After sleeping
one night under the cold stars, they managed to find a unused stable.
It was smelly but much warmer than the storehouse. They used a few
empty buckets to collect rainwater. It was both luck and misfortune
that it rained almost every day. Naminè caught a cold, but it
would've been worse if they had stayed in the storehouse, sleeping on
the bare ground.</P><P>One
rainy night, Olette felt something on her face that immediately woke
her up. After an incident at the storehouse in which some villagers
managed to finally track her down, she never slept very deeply,
always keeping one eye open. She had been wanted for stealing food
and Olette had been less cautious than usual. If she was caught,
there was no telling what punishment might await her. This was an age
filled with pirates, after all.</P><P>Olette
almost panicked when she noticed what exactly was on her face. It was
tickling a bit, but different from the straw. It was
more...silk-like.</P><P>The
first thing she saw when opening her eyes was Naminè's face, and it
was awfully close.</P><P>“What—”
Olette tried to yell out, but it was too late.</P><P>They
were really soft. If angels were real, theirs must feel like this
too. But Olette only was startled for a second and pulled away.</P><P>“Kairi...”
Naminè muttered in her feverish sleep.</P><P>“I'm
so not going to tell her this...” Olette said, and touched her own
lips.</P><P>Looking
around, everything seemed to be okay. The stable was old but
rainproof and warm. There was a base level, for horses and other
animals, but there weren't any now and it looked like there hadn't
been any for a long time. And there was a upper level, that served as
storage for straw. It was nice and dry. Olette had piled most of it
into one big huddle that the two used to sleep. They didn't need to
sleep close to each other, as it was warm enough with just the straw.
But they preferred to be close to each other, almost as if each
feared the other would vanish if they were even a little apart.</P><P>With
the days passing on, and no change in obtaining any info about Kairi,
Naminè got more and more depressed, closely sticking to Olette all
the time unless she was going out to secure food or trying to get a
hold of some info that might be related to Kairi.</P><P>Naminè
didn't look good. They both were barely eating anything, and the
water—even though it was
rainwater—wasn't very
clear. It really was unhealthy, and they could get seriously sick if
this went on.</P><P>Olette
had problems of her own, more on a emotional level than everything
else. For her, not finding Kairi was a horrifying thought. Or worse,
finding her dead. Hope was just a faint glimmer after all this time,
but there was no way she could show this side of hers to Naminè.</P><P>How
long would they be able to stay alive at this rate? Or what if they
really were waiting for nothing. What if...?</P><P>“I
shouldn't even be thinking something like that!” Olette said to
herself, and fell backwards in the straw.</P><P>Naminè
really looked miserable. Each day, the hardest thing for Olette to
endure was not hunger or the steadily increasing hopelessness, but
the disappointed expression Naminè made when Olette could only tell
her she found out nothing.</P><P>“What
should I do? We can't even escape this world...we barely managed to
open a portal...did we... lose our only chance of ever getting back?”</P><P>It
was a horrifying thought. What if Kairi really had given up her life
to bring them back just so that they could return to this dreadful
world to die a slow death of starvation and hopelessness?</P><P>“Olette...”
Naminè had woken up.</P><P>“Did
I wake you? I'm sorry, Naminè. Go back to sleep, everything is
fine.”</P><P>“...it's
not.”</P><P>Olette
knew what was coming. She felt the same, but there was nothing she
could do. But it must be so much harder on Naminè than it was on
her.</P><P>“We
still don't know where Kairi is...and she's not here.”</P><P>Naminè
felt sick. They hadn't eaten anything for over twenty-four hours, but
she didn't feel like eating anything at all.</P><P>It
was lonely without Kairi around, but she knew that Olette was trying
her best. Naminè just couldn't put up a mask and pretend to be well.
Her emotional condition was even worse than her body.</P><P>Naminè
wasn't very robust, nothing like Olette. The current circumstances
were hard on her, and it took its toll on her body.</P><P>Olette
thought back. Things had taken a turn for the worse over these past
days. So much so that it was hard for them not to lose faith.</P><p 
align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>It
was not a nice day. The days in this town had never been nice. Olette
had quickly learned that this town was rough and the people in it
were not very friendly to outsiders. And she was a outsider, one to
this whole world. For now they had food in the storage room they used
as hideout. Naminè's condition hadn't been a good one. She sometimes
coughed and had a runny nose, and it wasn't rare that she shivered at
night even though they were close together. Olette could only hope
that Naminè wasn't getting seriously sick.</P><P>Her
first checkpoint was a tavern. From the books she had read, a tavern
was always a good spot to collect info. But a girl like her in a
tavern in a harbor town would certainly look wrong. Well, she had no
clothes to change, so there was really no helping it. Olette ruffled
her hair, then took some of the mud on the ground and put it on her
face, trying to look as much like a wild brat as possible.</P><P>Just
seconds after she entered the tavern, one of the men inside were
already on her trail.</P><P>“Hey,
this ain't a place for little brats, missy.” His voice was shaken
by alcohol and he smelled like a stable of pigs.</P><P>“Shut
up, drunkard.” Olette felt weird using such foul language, but this
was certainly not a place to be picky.</P><P>“What
did ye say? Hey, I think this damn brat wants a real beating,” the
man shouted all over the noise in the tavern.</P><P>He
violently grabbed Olette's shoulder—she
was more than two heads shorter than he—and
tried to hold her back. It was clear that he was filled with ill
intent.</P><P>Olette
knew that unless she made an overwhelming first strike, this would
escalate in a fight. And that was the last thing she wanted.</P><P>A
powerful punch in the abdomen followed by a side kick at his ribs
sent the man to his knees, gasping for air.</P><P>“Don't
mess with me!” Olette angrily said.</P><P>She
was deep down so scared that if not for the poor light in the tavern,
everyone could've seen that her legs were shaking a bit. It was just
dumb luck that the man had had enough and did not try to continue the
fight.</P><P>“Hey,
barkeeper, I need some info.”</P><P>“I'm
sorry, missy, but we ain't selling no milk.”</P><P>The
barkeeper roared with laughter, and everyone else that heard it
joined in. It was very humiliating, but Olette endured it.</P><P>“One
of my friends got marooned on a island in the South Sea. Some guy
named Jack Sparrow got us into the mess.” Olette tried her best to
sound as pirate-ish as possible, but it was a rather poor show.</P><P>The
barkeeper seemed to be a nice person, though, as he didn't just send
her away. Maybe it was because she had mentioned Jack Sparrow.</P><P>“There
are hundreds of islands in the South Sea, missy. If ye ain't got the
coordinates, you've no chance of ever finding her. If she's alive,
anyway.”</P><P>Olette
bit her lip. Hundreds? Maybe a map would help, but the only thing she
knew was the size of the island and that there was nothing else
around it as far as the eye could see. This was much worse than she
had imagined.</P><P>“Many
thanks,” Olette said, and was on her way out.</P><P>“Next
time you come, I'll make sure to have some milk for ye,” the
barkeeper shouted after her. Yet again more than half of the tavern
broke out in laughter.</P><P>Her
search was not very effective. The taverns all had little but no time
for her problems, and some people even reacted angrily and sent her
away when she mentioned Jack Sparrow. The first day of searching was
a complete failure. What would she tell Naminè?</P><P>The
blond girl was waiting patiently in the storehouse, and Olette's
first task when she got back was to eat some of the bread that almost
tasted good after that hard a day.</P><P>“Did
you find anything out, Olette?” Naminè asked in a hopeful tone.</P><P>“...I'll
have more luck tomorrow! I promise.” Olette said, completely
avoiding an answer, but feeling guilty when Naminè made a sad
expression and let out two small coughs.</P><P>She
had found out nothing. They went to sleep, and tired as Olette was,
she slept like a rock. The next morning was the same as before, rainy
and dark. Olette awoke before Naminè, which seemed weird to her.</P><P>Naminè
didn't look too good either. Olette was scared of the thought that
Naminè might get sick. She was physically much more robust than
Naminè, so she could do with a fever. But for the frail girl...</P><P>They
ate some of what they had found—bread
again—and Olette left to
continue her search.</P><P>Nothing.
People were unwilling to help, and even if someone was, in a rare
case, they could not tell her anything useful. There were too many
unmapped islands in the South Sea. It was a hopeless undertaking.</P><P>Another
thing was on her mind. Food. Olette knew that just living off bread
would not work, especially if Naminè was showing signs of getting
sick. It was hard to admit, but no one would let her work. She was
too young, and even if she had enough strength to work on the harbor,
they wouldn't let her. There was only one choice left.</P><P>“I
will go to hell for this,” Olette muttered to herself, but she too
didn't want to eat the old bread anymore. It was not good for their
bodies.</P><P>Not
too far away from their hideout was something like a grocery shop.
Many people were going in and out, and after a while, Olette had
figured out a blind spot. She waited just when someone was going to
pay and hid herself beyond a shelf. She would only take a little,
enough for herself and Naminè.</P><P>She
grabbed a few apples and oranges, then sneaked away. Nobody suspected
anything, as she hid the fruits under her clothes. They got a bit
dirty, but that was nothing they couldn't solve with a bit of water.</P><P>“I
got us something to eat,” Olette said, giving Naminè two apples
and a orange, leaving a apple for herself.</P><P>“Did
you find out anything?” Naminè repeated her question as before but
with much less enthusiasm this time.</P><P>“...I'm
sorry. Eat the apples, they're good. You should wash them before,
though.” Olette knew that Naminè was needing the fruits more than
she did.</P><P>“Why
do you only have one apple?” Naminè was curious, looking at how
Olette was having so much less than she was.</P><P>“I
ate a orange and an apple already on the way.” It was such a
blatant lie that even Naminè would notice. Her smile, her
expression, they were all fake.</P><P>“Okay,
then. Thank you, I'm really sick of the bread,” Naminè said and
turned around.</P><P>Naminè
knew that Olette was lying, but not why. To have other food was good,
but Olette lying to her hurt. Also, there were no news of Kairi. She
missed the redhead more, each day her hope shrinking that she would
see her again.</P><P>But...Olette
was still there with her. It was really painful that Olette felt the
need to lie to her, but at least, she would not leave her.</P><P>The
night passed as usual, Olette again waking up before Naminè. They
always slept leaned onto each other, but this morning, Naminè was
lying on the ground, looking really pale.</P><P>Naminè
was sweating and breathing weird. She looked really sick and her head
was burning. Even worse, Olette dreamed of Kairi that night, and now
the reality of her being gone for good sank even deeper inside her.</P><P>“Naminè,
how are you feeling?”</P><P>Olette
was worried. It was past noon, probably, and Naminè had only woken
up now. She could only tell when she asked someone on the street, as
she was unfamiliar with this region's day and night shifts.</P><P>“I'm...okay.
Olette, will you...look for Kairi? I...miss her so much.” Naminè
seemed really weak. More than usual. And even worse, now that Naminè
was showing signs of being affected by Kairi's absence, she had to
hurry.</P><P>But
could she really leave a sick girl alone? Naminè was needing some
vitamins, but there was only so much she could do. Olette would need
to go to the shop again.</P><P>“I
will look for some clues. Please stay here, don't move, and sleep
some.” Olette had used two boxes as windshield, and Naminè had the
blanket for her alone, providing some warmth.</P><P>It
was probably only a cold, but Olette could only imagine what might
happen next.</P><P>It
was easy, just as the day before, to get some fruits. It was
stealing. A crime. But what choice did she have?</P><P>Looking
for Kairi had proven to be so hopeless that she ignored it for today
and went straight back to the storehouse. For now, Naminè was
important to her too.</P><P>“Did
you find out anything?” Naminè asked, as if Olette had been gone
for hours and not just a little more than half a hour.</P><P>“I
think I might have a clue,” Olette lied, hoping to make Naminè
feel better.</P><P>“Don't
lie to me, please,” Naminè said, tears in her eyes.</P><P>“I'm
sorry...but...it's much harder than I thought. And I can't leave you
alone,” Olette said, kneeling down next to Naminè, hugging her.</P><P>“Don't
worry about me. We just need to find Kairi and everything will be
okay...” Naminè seemed really out of it.</P><P>“I...no...<I>we</I>

will find her. I promise.” Olette realized how much she truly
missed Kairi.</P><P>But...just
how much hope was there? The last she saw of Kairi was beyond a
gateway, on a gigantic freezing platform, left with injuries and
exhausted to the point where she couldn't move. Was...she really
alive? And was there any hope to find her...in time?</P><P>They
spent the rest of the day resting, Olette quietly watching over
Naminè, as she had demanded that Naminè sleep as much as possible
to recover.</P><P>The
night was cold, but Olette endured it for the sake of Naminè. Three
days had passed since they arrived. Three days, and they still had no
clue where Kairi was.</P><P>Naminè
seemed much better in the morning, but Olette didn't let her get up
yet. One more day. Just one more day to rest and Naminè could get up
again. At least that was what Olette was thinking. Naminè refused to
to sleep if Olette was not next to her. It was a irresponsible
request, even Naminè knew that, but it was really hard to be alone
all the time.</P><P>Naminè's
condition got better, but only slowly and only on a physical level.
She clung more and more to Olette, similar to how she had done with
Kairi in the beginning. Olette didn't mind, as it was soothing for
her too to have company in this, the worst of situations.</P><P>It
was the fifth day that would turn over their whole situation. Olette
was on her way back when she thought that someone was following her.
But wouldn't they just run after her and get her?</P><P>She
turned around, but there was nothing.</P><P>It
had to be her imagination. After all, she really was worn out by
continuously stealing and the feelings of remorse that came with it.
No matter what, stealing wasn't right, but Olette cared more for
Naminè than for some shop owner.</P><P>Naminè
didn't ask anymore. She understood that Olette had not given up on
Kairi but had given up on finding info on her while she, Naminè, was
sick.</P><P>Again,
they spent the day without talking much. It was really cold when
Naminè got up on her own, leaning onto Olette, to share the blanket.
It was so obvious that Olette was freezing that Naminè couldn't bear
it anymore, even though there was a chance that Olette could sick,
too.</P><P>“But—”</P><P>Naminè
cut her off, laying a finger on her lips. “No buts,” she said,
almost immediately falling asleep after that.</P><P>Olette
smiled to herself for a bit, then petted Naminè's head. Maybe Naminè
wasn't as weak as Olette thought she was.</P><P>Soon,
the brunette also fell asleep. It was tiring to keep watch over
Naminè, steal food, and even to think about what they would do next.
Olette really missed Kairi, and she did need her now more than ever.</P><P>The
night was quiet as usual, only disturbed by sounds from a nearby
tavern. Olette never could sleep very well in these times. She woke
up when some scratching sound was on the front door. She had built up
a few boxes in front of it in case someone were to attack them.</P><P>From
the sound of it, outside were numerous people. Olette got up, trying
not to wake up Naminè, and found herself eavesdropping through the
thin wooden wall.</P><P>“Ye
sure she's in there?” a rough voice asked.</P><P>Olette
didn't know who the voice belonged to.</P><P>“That
dirty lil' food thief is gonna meet 'er end. The stuff in there ain't
owned by nobody anymore, so let's just burn it down and to hell with
her.” The person who said this was enraged—and
this voice was familiar too. It was the owner of the shop!</P><P>Olette
had heard enough. She stepped back from the wall, trying to avoid any
sound, and took Naminè piggyback. It would take too long to wake her
up.</P><P>“What
would Kairi do? Fight the people? No...Kairi would never harm
uninvolved people. But if I take the window, they will get me and
Naminè. Leaving her alone and surrendering won't solve anything
either...”</P><P>Olette
was rather desperate, even summoning Circle of Life as last
countermeasure. But wait...would those people even notice if they
made an attempt to escape? Olette had little choice and trusted her
instincts. With one brutal swing, the back wall burst, and in the
same moment, a bright light shone in from outside. The front had been
set on fire.</P><P>It
was a wink of luck that they didn't notice the bursting sound of the
wall. Olette escaped, carrying Naminè, and dematerialized Hero's
Crest, running as fast as she could. For now, they had to escape, no
matter where to. Naminè was sick, so it was highly unlikely that she
would wake up.</P><P>Olette
only stopped when there was nothing but darkness around her anymore.
She had long left the town, and had not stopped running for another
ten minutes at full power. Her legs were still shaking when she
finally slowed down. Naminè had just regained consciousness and
Olette let her down, herself sinking in the wet grass, unable to
stand.</P><P>“Olette...what
happened? And...where are we? It's so dark...”</P><P>“They...found
our hideout and wanted to burn us alive...we barely escaped.”
Olette was dead tired.</P><P>“But
why? Did we do something bad?” Naminè asked, not knowing that it
was only Olette they wanted.</P><P>“We're
outsiders. It's only natural to want us gone. We're somewhere outside
the town...up ahead is a forest, we should rest there for the night.”
Olette was biting her lip. Just how often had she lied to Naminè in
the past few days?</P><P>“I
don't understand...can't we go back?”</P><P>Olette
shook her head, letting out a sigh. It was impossible. Completely
burned down. But how would she tell Naminè they had wanted her head
for stealing? The worst part was that she had gotten Naminè
involved.</P><P>Naminè
seemed to feel that something was wrong and asked away.</P><P>“Olette?
You look...really pale.”</P><P>Olette
just shook her head, unable to say anything. She picked Naminè up
yet again and slowly walked over to the trees.</P><P>It
was true, Olette didn't feel well. She had not eaten anything but old
bread and a few fruits for days, slept in miserable conditions and
had been out in the rain for hours in the past days. Olette was at
her limit. Running like that for over ten minutes was too much for
her. She felt sick and her breath was still going at a alarming rate.</P><P>Only
a bit further, Olette could see now that her eyes had gotten used to
the darkness, was the border of a forest. In there, the wind wouldn't
be as strong, and perhaps they could find a dry spot.</P><P>“What
now?” Naminè was asking, sitting next to Olette.</P><P>“Now...a
place to sleep...” Olette just couldn't regain her breath.</P><P>“The
town is dangerous...I guess we can't go back.” Naminè didn't know
what had happened, but if the villagers had wanted to burn them
alive, they must've been really mad.</P><P>“Let's
just...sleep under a tree. Little choice there. There is a forest
close by.”</P><P>Olette's
vision was blurred and it took her a lot of effort to force it clear
as she tried not to pass out.</P><P>Naminè
felt sick, but out of the two, she could at least walk, unlike
Olette, who was looking like she would collapse any second now. It
was now time for her to fight too and ignore the horrible nausea when
moving and help Olette, who had helped her all this time.</P><P>“<I>Herder
of the Travelers, I beg of you, grant us your blessing. Give us the
power to reach our destination, to reach the place we desire!”</I></P><P>It
was just a simple cure spell, and it wasn't useful for
battle-orientated use. It was rather effective if only used to walk
another mile or two.</P><P>Olette
could feel some of her pain being relieved, but it still was hard to
stand up. Naminè herself had to fight with a stringing pain in her
head that came from the mental exhaustion of using a spell in these
conditions.</P><P>“Save
your magic...let's go over there,” Olette said, grabbing Naminè's
hand. Both of them leaning onto each other, they walked towards the
dark forest.</P><P>They
did not waste energy on talking; instead they looked for a place to
spent the night. They walked more than five minutes since they
entered the thick forest, and finally found a suitable tree with a
big crest.</P><P>Olette
leaned onto the trunk and sank down, barely keeping consciousness.
Naminè was next to her, leaning on Olette rather than on the tree.</P><P>“I'm
so tired...“ Olette suddenly got depressed, thinking about Naminè's
condition. “I'm sorry we don't even have a blanket or anything...”</P><P>“I'll
be fine.” Naminè forced herself to smile. “As long you're next
to me, Olette.”</P><P>Olette
blushed for a moment, slightly embarrassed, then laid a arm around
Naminè, trying to share as much body warmth as possible.</P><P>“Good...night,”
both of them said, falling asleep halfway. Morning was only a few
hours away.</P><P>The
night passed in a wink, and the morning did not hold any change. They
both continued to sleep, exhausted to no end, and the day, almost as
dark and cold as the night, came quickly to an end.</P><P>Olette
slowly woke up, sore from sleeping out in the cold. It hurt to move
at first, but the pain wasn't as bad as before. First thing was to
check on Naminè.</P><P>She
seemed to be in pain, which was not very surprising, given her
illness and that they had slept under the stars with nothing but
themselves to warm them up.</P><P>“Naminè,
wake up!” Olette slapped her face softly while talking to her.</P><P>Opening
her eyes a bit, Naminè looked at Olette, smiling, then coughing. At
least she was conscious. That was a huge relief.</P><P>“How
are you feeling? Give me a honest answer, okay?” Olette said with a
smile on her lips.</P><P>“Terrible,”
Naminè said, slowly remembering where they were and what had
happened.</P><P>“We
need to find a proper place to spend our nights and for you to rest.
I feel better, so I'll carry you.”</P><P>Naminè
just gave a nod, still sleepy and unable to give a proper answer. She
just wanted to sleep some more.</P><P>Olette
picked up Naminè so she could carry her on her back. Now worried at
how light the blond girl was, she started walking. She could only
guess where the forest ended, but Olette remembered that they came
from the direction she had faced when she woke up.</P><P>“Will
we be okay?” Naminè asked, trying not to be too much of a burden
to Olette.</P><P>“I'll
find us someplace to stay.”</P><P>Somewhere
near the borders of the town would be ideal, so that they wouldn't
cause too much of a commotion if they were sighted.</P><P>Naminè
fell back asleep after hearing that Olette was looking for a place to
stay. Olette was grateful for that. It was tiring to talk and think
at the same time, and she had to think about a lot of things. Most
important right now was to find a place to spend the the night.</P><P>The
town was terribly quiet. There were noises, sure, but not the kind
two girls at night wanted to hear. The short distance to the harbor
must have had a bad influence on this district.</P><P>She
continued walking, looking for any building they could use for
shelter, but Olette had little choice. In the end, she was limited to
where she could go.</P><P>If
they were thinking she had burned to death, then that was fine. They
would not track her down. The matter of food was something that was
still giving her a headache. Stealing would lead to a similar
situation as before.</P><P>How
much time had passed since they had gotten back in town? The
continuous dark sky and rain had made her lose all feeling of time.
It was like this town was cursed.</P><P>They
were almost at the end of the street, near the wall that was
surrounding the city, when Olette found something promising.</P><P>A
abandoned building. It was big, much too big to be a house, and too
far away from the harbor to be a depot for goods. The front door was
locked, but the lock itself was old and rusty, which was a good sign.
No one had entered the building for a long time.</P><P>Looking
for a way to get to its back, Olette found a hole in the fence, not
too far away. It was time to wake up Naminè, as she couldn't carry
her through this. Using her Keyblade would inevitably draw attention,
and it also would open the door for just anyone.</P><P>“Naminè...wake
up,” Olette said, still carrying her, standing in front of the
fence.</P><P>“Hm...what...where...?”
Naminè was still out of it.</P><P>It
took her a few minutes to fully open her eyes. Olette let her down,
but took her hand in exchange. Naminè, being sick and sleepy, was a
bit unstable but managed not to fall.</P><P>“Where
are we?” Naminè started to look around, then looked at the big
building slightly to the right.</P><P>“The
outskirts of the town, at the edge of the harbor district, I guess,”
Olette answered, then pointing over to the abandoned building.</P><P>“Looks
abandoned...I'm not sure what this was, but we can't be picky.”
Olette drew Naminè closer to herself, taking a deep breath.</P><P>“Olette?
What are you—” Naminè
was surprised. Olette seemed really tired.</P><P>“Nothing.
I'm okay. Let's take a look. I had to wake you up since if something
is in there, I won't be able to protect you if I'm carrying you.”
Olette was considering that bandits or robbers used this place as
hideout, even if it was unlikely.</P><P>“I'll
be okay.” Naminè smiled even though she was not feeling well.</P><P>It
was not right to always rely on Olette and not give anything back. If
anything, Naminè would not show how ill she felt, even if it only
lightened up Olette's mood a bit.</P><P>Olette
just gave a nod, summoned Circle of Life, and crawled through the
hole. Naminè followed shortly after, without Keyblade. It was a
mental burden for now, and she would only summon it if they were
attacked.</P><P>They
didn't speak a word, trying to be as quiet as possible, and slowly
walked over to the building. There was no light, no sound, nothing.</P><P>Rumbling.
The sky was in turmoil. Soon, the neverending rain would pour down
again. They had to hurry; staying out in the rain would gravely
worsen Naminè's condition.</P><P>The
back doors were wide open. Olette took a peek inside, ready to strike
at whatever would wait for them.</P><P>But
there was nothing. Just dust, dust from a long time of no living
being entering the place. No sign of anyone living there.</P><P>Olette
didn't let her guard down. She looked in every corner and had Naminè
stand by at the back door.</P><P>Nothing.
Just more dust. Even on the level above, there was nothing but a
enormous pile of straw. For once, luck was with them.</P><P>“Naminè,
can you come up here?” Olette deemed it safe and dematerialized her
Keyblade.</P><P>A
bit later, they checked every corner again. It was indeed an old
stable, but there hadn't been any animals here for a long time. It
was wind and waterproof and even a bit warm. They decided to use the
straw to sleep on, since it would also give them the advantage of not
being found immediately if anyone would enter the building.</P><P>Olette
and Naminè laid down in the straw, tired and exhausted, almost
instantly falling asleep. Olette had embraced Naminè, not caring
anymore if she too got sick.</P><P>“I'll
do everything to protect you,” was the last thing Olette whispered
before following Naminè in the land of dreams.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Rain
was hammering on the roof and thunder was roaring across the sky. It
had been like this for the past few days, as if illustrating how the
girls were feeling. It had been hard on both of them, physically and
emotionally.</P><P>Without
a word, Olette crawled over to Naminè, hugged her, and petted her
head. She had done this often in the last few days, and even though
it first had felt weird and Naminè had been a bit awkward, they both
were able to calm down like this.</P><P>Minutes
passed, and Naminè thought Olette had fallen asleep, holding her
like this. Even though it wasn't Kairi who was doing this, she felt
that Olette had gotten just as important to her as Kairi was.</P><P>Naminè
wasn't sure how she should feel about Olette. It was clearly
different than how she felt about Kairi, but...</P><P>“Say,
Naminè...what would you do if someone else liked Kairi?”</P><P>Hadn't
Olette fallen asleep? And what was with that question?</P><P>“Everyone
likes Kairi. What do you mean?”</P><P>Olette
started petting her head again. It had somehow a soothing effect on
both of them.</P><P>“I
don't mean that. I mean...what would you do if someone else loved
Kairi?”</P><P>Naminè
knew what love was. Back in Hollow Bastion, Olette had once explained
to her the difference between like and love. But it had never crossed
her mind that someone else could fall in love with Kairi.</P><P>“I
don't know. Would that be so bad?” Naminè just never thought about
it.</P><P>What
would she do? It didn't seem like a big deal if someone else liked
Kairi. Did it really matter that much?</P><P>“Imagine
if Kairi stopped liking you, even stopped being your friend, just
because she liked someone else.” Olette felt horrible suggesting
such a thing, even more so, since she was the one that came to like
Kairi too. “Would you hate that person?”</P><P>Olette
tried her best to not let her voice tremble. If not for the warm
straw and Naminè in her arms, she would've surely been shaken by the
fear of what Naminè might say now.</P><P>“I
don't know...if that person took Kairi away from me...I guess I would
hate her.”</P><P>Olette
almost bit her tongue. What should she do? It was good Naminè was a
bit dense, so it was rather unlikely that she would find out.
But...what should she do? Olette now long knew she was clearly
attracted to Kairi. She had even been jealous about the kiss between
Kairi and Naminè.</P><P>“But...”</P><P>Naminè
didn't know how to say it. She could feel Olette tremble, and her
heart beating like crazy. She was clearly afraid. Even Naminè was
not that dense, and it was obvious that her words had caused Olette
to act like that. At the same moment she had said it, the brunette
had also stopped petting her head.</P><P>What
if she was right and Olette really was in love with Kairi? After
all...on the island...</P><P>Naminè
was confused. Was it really that bad if Olette was in love with
Kairi? She wouldn't snatch Kairi away and leave her all alone, right?
Her head felt like it was melting, like it was on fire, and Olette
seemed freezing. Was it just her imagination, or did Olette seem to
be gritting her teeth?</P><P>“If
it was you...I...I think I wouldn't hate the person. You are
important to me, too. And you wouldn't just take Kairi from me. You
are not a bad person like that.”</P><P>For
a second, the wheels in Olette's head were standing still. Did Naminè
really say that? Was it that she had caught a fever too and was
hallucinating? If so, then...</P><P>“You
mean you wouldn't get mad if I were to like Kairi too?”</P><P>Naminè
was silent for a moment, trying to sort out her inner conflict.
Shouldn't she get bad feelings? Be jealous that someone else was
hoping for Kairi to respond to her feelings? But there was nothing
like that.</P><P>“Do
you love Kairi?” Naminè just didn't know what to say and went just
bluntly saying what she was thinking.</P><P>Olette
couldn't answer. Naminè had become really important to her and if
admitting love meant for those two to end their friendship, she would
rather give up on Kairi. Olette couldn't lie to Naminè. Not about
this, not now.</P><P>“I
think I do.” Olette could have slapped herself.</P><P>Awkward
silence filled the room, only disturbed by the rain and thunder. It
seemed like a eternity had passed when Naminè gave out a sigh.
Olette was short of snapping and taking back what she had said.</P><P>After
all the time she had spent around friends, yet being all alone that
time, she had finally found two people who were really important to
her. And one of them seemed so far away that it hurt. And it was not
just Kairi that was far away.</P><P>“I...I...”
Olette could not even speak properly anymore. Cold sweat on her
forehead, her body frozen stiff.</P><P>“Say,
Olette...why is it that Kairi can only like one of us?”</P><P>Naminè
had thought of it before, but not talked about it. It had been on her
mind for some time now, starting with the night on the island when
Olette had been acting really weird. Why did they have to choose? Why
couldn't they be together? Naminè didn't want to lose either, not
Kairi and not Olette.</P><P>“I
can't really explain it, but...” Olette was a bit out of it, simply
because she still had to fight with her inner fear of being rejected
as a friend now.</P><P>“It's
special to love someone. You can't just love two people. I would say,
it's impossible...”</P><P>Naminè
moved a bit, Olette let her loose as soon as she noticed it, but
instead of moving away, which was what Olette was afraid of, she just
rolled over, still as close to Olette, but now with her back to her.</P><P>Olette
was startled when she felt something soft on her hand. At first she
thought it was a mouse or something, but it was much softer and...it
was holding her hand.</P><P>“I
don't want to choose between Kairi and you,” Naminè said, holding
tight onto the hand of her friend.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Darkness.
All around him. There was nothing but darkness. No wind, not even
air. No sound, not even that of his own breath. Eternal darkness,
thick enough to not see one's own hands even if they were held right
before one's face. No horizon, just a vast nothingness.</P><P>“Ironic,
that this is to be the true nature of us, who seek to regain their
hearts.”</P><P>In
front of him was a huge white gate, and beyond its open doors was the
unfathomable darkness, a power equal to that of Kingdom Hearts. If
one were to step through this gate, both death and immeasurable power
would await.</P><P>“Why
did you call us, Superior?”</P><P>Xigbar,
kneeling a few meters behind the man he spoke to, was shaken by fear
that Xemnas had discovered what he was hiding.</P><P><I>Zexion's
research</I>. The artificial creation of Nobodies. Tempering with a
power, alien and incalculable.</P><P>Left
to him was Luxord, who had been beaten badly by the Keyblader. His
face was warped in anger, something Xigbar had never seen on the
usually calm Gambler of Fate. He had been ordered to collect hearts;
yet, he failed and even got beaten. The screams of Luxord when Xemnas
had punished him were engraved in Xigbar's head.</P><P>One
place further left was Saix, calm and uncaring as ever. If something
was as dangerous as what laid beyond the gate, then it was Saix.
Three days ago, he had obliterated a world called the Land of Pride.
A whole world. Xigbar was powerful, but far from that level. Saix was
a monster.</P><P>Right
to him, and he squeezed his eyes when he looked at him, was Xaldin.
If Saix was a monster, Xaldin was the tamer with the whip that let
the beast dance and destroy everything in its path. He was cruel, as
uncaring as Saix, and coldly calculated the death of his opponents
using both comrades in arms and enemies to his advantage. Fighting
with Xaldin was just as bad as fighting against him.</P><P>Right
next to Xaldin, there was Demyx, the biggest mystery out of all these
weirdos. Xigbar couldn't follow anything he said or anything he was
thinking. Even his actions were contradictory and unbelievable. He
had fought with the sorceress from Hollow Bastion on equal grounds.
But ever since he came back, he had changed. It seemed like insanity
had taken over him completely.</P><P>All
of them were kneeling in a half-circle behind Xemnas, as he had
summoned them.</P><P>“We
will abandon the plan of using the Keyblader to collect hearts. We
will seize the hearts ourselves.”</P><P>Xigbar
first thought he was saved when he understood the extent of what
Xemnas had just said.</P><P>“What
do you mean, Xemnas?” It was Xaldin who first stood up and took a
step forward.</P><P>In
a mere instant, Xemnas had whirled around and where previously had
been Xaldin's left arm, there was a huge gap of nothingness in his
body.</P><P>Xigbar's
mind was blank and empty. Xemnas...had just killed Xaldin. On a whim.
In less than a second. He didn't even notice how he killed him. It
was too fast for even him, despite his sniper-like eyes.</P><P>Even
worse, nobody seemed to mind. Luxord didn't even notice, Demyx didn't
care and Saix's expression was as frozen as ever.</P><P>“Xigbar.”</P><P>It
was his turn. He would be killed next. Xemnas must've turned insane.
He would kill them all. And there was no hope of escape. It was
further than one hundred feet to the gate and Xemnas had killed
Xaldin in a instant.</P><P>The
said person had collapsed and was lying on the ground, probably
already dead. Blood was flooding out of his body and there were no
signs of life. His heart must have been gone, along with his arm and
half of his chest.</P><P>He
could not fight against him. His body wouldn't move. The blood was
surrounding his feet, his knees. Xaldin's blood. He had not liked
him, but to cold-bloodedly kill one of his subordinates without any
warning...that was completely beyond anything he had ever seen.</P><P>How
would Xemnas strike? How would he attack? Was there any chance of
escape?</P><P>To
make it worse, neither Saix, Luxord or Demyx seemed to notice that
they were in danger.</P><P>“Xigbar,
you...”</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>The
rain was cold, and she was freezing. They were hungry, and Olette had
no choice but to resort again to the means of a criminal. She had
been stealing food for a few days now, but she would not tell Naminè.
This burden, she had to shoulder alone.</P><P>But
luck was on her side. She only passed the harbor by accident, and a
ship was loading provisions for a voyage. Only two guards, but who
would expect a thief to come in this pouring rain? Olette had
somewhat overcome her inner scruples to steal. If she didn't, they
had to starve, and in Naminè's condition, that could prove to be
fatal.</P><P>They
didn't seem to be heavily armed, and the rain was pouring down,
limiting their sight and hearing. Olette didn't waste any time and
had already sneaked behind one of the guards. Luckily, he was
standing near a building. He didn't notice Olette until he felt a
brutal blow on his neck and lost consciousness. It was all but
honorable to assault someone from behind, but Olette didn't care.</P><P>The
other guard didn't notice and while Olette positioned the unconscious
guard on the ground, she spotted a one of the bigger boxes not too
far away.</P><P>Not
looking inside, Olette took the box, and with all her might, loaded
it onto her back before running for it.</P><P>Luck
had left her in that very moment, as the other guard went to check on
the first guard and noticed Olette. Drawing a gun, he opened fire and
chased after the girl. About a round bullets later, he had lost her,
due to the poor visibility in the rain.</P><P>In
a dark side-alley, more than five minutes nonstop running away from
the harbor, Olette allowed herself to calm down, take a breath and
finally look inside the box.</P><P>What
luck. The box was filled with cured meat, flat-bread and dry fruits.
She must have hit the best box there was. This would last for at
least a few days. Now that the adrenaline was gone, Olette felt her
mind going fuzzy. Pain was suddenly occupying her left arm. Looking
on it, a line of blood was running down from about her upper arm. A
stray bullet wound. At least she had not been shot, but she could
barely move her arm now that she felt the pain.</P><P>It
was nothing compared to when she had fought the man from the
Organization, but it really was bad. Ripping some cloth from her
shirt that was completely soaked anyway, she applied a first aid
bandage. It hurt a lot to do it herself, and she surely would not be
able to fight the next few days with this arm.</P><P>Olette
took the box back on her back. Thank God it was even darker than
usual thanks to the rainstorm so no one was likely to notice her.</P><P>The
pain was overwhelming. Blood ran down her arm even though she had
applied a bandage. But what did she expect? For someone with a small
frame like hers, carrying a huge box like that was usually
impossible. She only was able to do it due to her training with Tifa.
A few times she had to stop, her mind going blank and almost falling
over. She must've lost a lot of blood already.</P><P>It
was already the fourth time when she had to stop. Olette had barely
set the box on the ground when she fell and would have hit the ground
if she hadn't clung to the box at the last minute. When she looked
down, there was blood on the ground. But her arm hadn't touched the
ground. Where did it come from?</P><P>It
was running down her leg. Had a bullet hit her? But there was no huge
pain like in her arm. Olette needed to know, rolled up one of her
pants legs and found the cause of the blood. Another stray bullet
wound...just how many times had she been hit? But the wound didn't
seem to be as bad as on her arm. The bullet must've barely hit her.
It was bleeding a bit, but the pain was rather small. She had to make
it back fast. Ripping yet another piece of cloth from her shirt,
Olette applied a tight bandage on her leg—so
tight that it hurt to move it even a inch. But it did seem to stop
the bleeding for the moment.</P><P>Back
up went the box. It was only one more street till the stable. She was
soaked and exhausted. She had lost a lot of blood and was injured. If
not for her willpower, she would've passed out long ago. But one
thing kept her going. One important thing.</P><P>“Naminè...I'm
almost there.”</P><P>But
for now, it was clearly Olette that was in the worse condition. They
had no means of disinfecting her wounds, nor real first aid. Would
Naminè be able to use healing magic? Olette had faith in her.</P><P>The
warm atmosphere of the stable, the smell of straw—she
finally was at home. Home was where her friends were. And for now,
Naminè was here.</P><P>Hiding
the box in one of the horse boxes that were located directly below
the platform above, Olette ascended up the ladder and looked for
Naminè.</P><P>Was
she sleeping? Olette looked through the straw.</P><P>She
was not there. That couldn't be. There was no sign of a intruder. Was
her mind playing pranks? Olette looked more carefully, but it didn't
change the result. Naminè was gone.</P><P>“That
idiot must've gone and looked for me!” Olette whispered to herself,
and stood up.</P><P>Her
vision was blurred and her mind blank. Was Naminè okay? She had to
look for her. Had to find her. If something had happened to her, how
would she be able to face Kairi?</P><P>But
it was too much. Olette could not feel her legs, could not move. The
few seconds she was still able to stand seemed like a desperate
eternity. Was this the end? Was this empty dark feeling of failure
what Kairi felt when the portal closed? That couldn't be...it could
not just end like this...</P><P>“Naminè...where
are you...?” were her last words before everything went dark.</P><p 
align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Roaring
drums in her head, a familiar sound. The rain was a heavy as ever,
and the occasional thunder was like a gong being rung in her head.
Slowly waking up, Naminè first looked to see if she could spot
Olette. Naminè was still sick, unable to do any magic, and barely
able to do other things like walking around, so she was heavily
dependent on Olette.</P><P>She
wasn't there. Naminè assumed that she had gone to look for something
to eat. Food. It made her realize that her throat was terribly dry.
They used a set of buckets to collect rainwater, as Naminè was too
weak to use ice magic to provide water.</P><P>But
the bucket up here was empty. Olette must have forgotten to change
them. Looking at the empty bucket, Naminè first realized with how
much Olette had to put up recently. She wasn't of any help and Olette
brought food, cared for her, protected her...she really had grown
important to Naminè.</P><P>She
had little choice but to get some water herself. Slowly climbing down
the ladder, carrying the empty bucket with her, Naminè walked over
to the back gate. They could not close it, due to a lack of doors,
but it was a welcome breeze of fresh, even cold, air.</P><P>The
other bucket was standing next to the door. Leaving the empty one in
the rain, Naminè used a cup Olette had brought back one day to drink
some water. It wasn't delicious but it was enough for her.</P><P>Naminè
sated her thirst and looked at the sky that was filled with dark rain
clouds. Olette really was amazing. Ever since they had come here,
Olette had seem so reliable. Naminè asked herself how Olette managed
to keep going even though Kairi was gone and their situation was this
bad.</P><P>Some
time passed. Naminè had no feeling for time in her condition, so she
silently looked at the clouds, soothing her mind with the sound of
rain coming down. She wasn't really thirsty but her throat was dry
again, so she drank some more water. She switched the buckets
afterwards so she could take the full one back with her.</P><P>It
would be a hassle to get it up the ladder, as the full bucket was
proving rather heavy to carry for a sick girl, but Naminè wanted to
surprise Olette.</P><P>Naminè
finally reached the top, exhausted and tired, the bucket standing
next to her. There was something wet on the ground. Did she spill the
water? Looking down, Naminè almost screamed.</P><P>Blood.
A big stain of blood, going over to the place they used to sleep. A
thief? A burglar?</P><P>Naminè
summoned Monochrome, slowly walking into the direction where the
bloodstain stopped. Long before she reached the place, Naminè could
see the one who had caused the stain.</P><P>“<I>Olette!</I>”
Naminè yelled out. Letting go of Monochrome, she ran over to where
her best friend lay, not moving.</P><P>“Olette,
open your eyes, please!” Naminè knelt next to the brunette,
rolling her over. Her clothes were soaking wet, her trousers
blood-stained, her shirt ripped to pieces.</P><P>“What
happened, Olette?! Olette, hey!” Naminè tried shaking her,
breaking out in cold sweat. What should she do? Just what should she
do? They had no medicine, no first aid kit, nothing.</P><P>Olette
didn't move. Her breathing was faint, but it was still there. Naminè
buried her face in her hands, unable to do anything.</P><P>“What...what
should I do?”</P><P>Her
voice was trembling. Her whole body was shaken by the thought that
Olette might die. Panic filled her head, blocking off every single
rational thought. All she could do was sit there and watch the
unmoving Olette slowly bleeding to death.</P><P>Naminè
couldn't bear the thought that she might lose another important
person. She wanted to run away. To run so far away, that she would
never need to see this again. This horrifying image of Olette,
wounded and on the verge of death.</P><P>Naminè,
trying to get away, stumbled over her legs, falling back over. In
front of her lay something that she totally forgot. That was right.</P><P>She
wasn't just a powerless girl. She had healed Olette before. Her
condition was much worse than before, but that couldn't be helped.
Olette had taken care of her for several days, and now it was her
turn.</P><P>It
was hard to concentrate and even harder to get the recitation right,
but unless she brought in something very powerful, she didn't know
what would happen to Olette.</P><P>“<I>You,
who governs over life and death, commands creation and destruction,
decides fate and destiny, the bringer of new lives and the reaper of
the soul, I call upon you, Adamantia. Grant me the power to save the
life of one important to me. Grant me the power to overcome that
which is the fate of all who live.”</I></P><P>Nothing
happened. Did she fail? Naminè had never used this particular
recitation before. When tears of desperation showed in her eyes,
something moved. From Monochrome, a green light was flowing onto
Olette. Her breathing immediately resumed and Olette gasped once, but
she did not regain consciousness. Naminè, at the same time, could
feel both her arm and leg hurting and the pain was overwhelming. Her
mind almost went blank, and only looking at how Olette got better and
better by the second helped her to stay conscious.</P><P>It
was a very powerful recitation Naminè had learned from Aerith as
last resort to save others. It put a high strain on her body and
mind, and if not for her determination to save Olette, she would've
failed and both of them died.</P><P>Olette
curled around, gritting her teeth. This was her limit. Naminè could
not put up with this any longer, and both her will and the spell
broke. She lost consciousness and fell in the straw, Monochrome
dematerializing itself.</P><P>Silence
but for the drumming of the rain on the roof fell over the room like
a iron curtain. It took several minutes until Naminè finally moved,
only a twitch.</P><P>Would
Olette make it? Naminè was not sure. She couldn't see anything, she
could barely think. Now she knew why Aerith had told her not to use
that recitation unless it was absolutely the only way to save one of
the others. Her arm and leg was still hurting but it didn't feel like
she was bleeding herself.</P><P>Naminè
slowly opened her eyes, seeing Olette next to her. She was still
unconscious, but the bleeding seemed to have stopped. Naminè was
sure that that wasn't enough to heal Olette's wounds. She would have
to stay here the next days.</P><P>It
took Naminè all her remaining power to crawl over to where Olette
lay.</P><P>Naminè
only had one thing on her mind. Just one single thing. She wanted
Olette to pet her head, like she had done in the past days, whenever
she didn't feel good. It really had become a soothing action to her.</P><P>Naminè,
now laying next to Olette, could not move anymore. Her fever was
still there, and her head was burning. The mind all fuzzy, and vision
blurred. If only Olette would finally wake up.</P><P>But
she didn't. Was she...no. Naminè refused to believe it. Just laying
next to Olette, like a loyal dog waiting for its owner to get up,
Naminè lost consciousness again.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Was
she dead? Was this heaven? Around her was bright light, and there was
a warm feeling on her skin, as if the summer sun was shining on her.
Below her, an immeasurably vast grass field stretched out before her,
covering the ground as far as the eye could see. Above her, fluffy
white clouds floated in a heavenly blue sky. This really had to be
heaven.</P><P>She
could feel sorrow welling up, sorrow, about never seeing her friends
again, never talking to them again, never feeling their bodies next
to hers. Falling on her knees, she started to cry. It seemed like a
eternity until her tears stopped and only sadness remained. The grass
around her had died, the sky was filled with dark clouds, and the air
smelled of blood.</P><P>And
with one instant, unbearable pain ran through her body. Pain so
strong that she wished she would die on the spot. But death didn't
embrace her, no, the pain kept getting stronger, driving her insane.
She curled over in the withered grass, screaming out in agony, and
finally the pain was so strong her mind broke.</P><P>Darkness.
Around her, everything was dark. Her body hurt. The pain was still
there. Had she been taken from heaven to hell, and this was her
punishment? But...</P><P>She
opened her eyes a little bit, slowly getting used to seeing anything
again, and she managed to analyze the position she was in. Looking
up, she saw directly in a familiar face.</P><P>It
was Naminè.</P><P>“You're
awake, you're finally awake, Olette!” Naminè said, tears in her
eyes.</P><P>So,
that naive frail girl had treated her injuries and even saved her
life. It wasn't a dream.</P><P>“Yes,
thanks to you.” Olette was sure that if not for Naminè she really
would've died.</P><P>“I
was so worried...I was just refilling the bucket and when I came back
up here, you were all covered in blood and unconscious and...and...”
Naminè was about to cry.</P><P>She
walked over to Olette and sat down next to her so that Olette could
comfort her. She longed for that now.</P><P>“Stupid
girl, I won't die so easily,” Olette said, and embraced Naminè.
Although she was attracted to girls, it felt more like hugging her
little sister or a childhood friend.</P><P>“I
was really worried! Don't do something like that again!”</P><P>Naminè
made a sulking face and leaned onto Olette.</P><P>Naminè
really wasn't the naive spoiled kid she was when she first
arrived at Hollow Bastion anymore. Caring for Olette, risking her
life for a friend, all those things had helped her to mature a little
bit.</P><P>They
stayed like that for over a hour, not speaking, barely moving,
comforting each other by just their presence. They both were more
than just happy that the other one was alive, even though they were
in miserable conditions.</P><P>Finally,
their stomachs growled, and both noticed that they were starving.
Naminè didn't know about the box yet, but Olette was unable to
descend the ladder, so Naminè would have to choose what to eat.</P><P>“When
you go down the ladder, the last box before the yard—inside
is a huge box with food. I can't walk a single step with my leg like
this, so can you get something for us?”</P><P>Olette
didn't like to depend to on Naminè even now, after she had done all
this, but there was little choice. Surprisingly, Naminè gave a happy
nod, and vanished quickly. It took a few minutes until she came back.
The meat in the box was wrapped inside a big cloth, and Naminè used
it now as bag to transport a bit of food inside it.</P><P>“Some
meat—that's good, we
will need the protein—and
some dried fruits. The bread will make a good breakfast if we combine
it with some meat,” Olette said, and waited until Naminè took the
first bite.</P><P>They
ate in silence, again sitting close to each other. They quickly
finished what Naminè had brought up, and she went down again to get
a bit more of the meat. The box was big enough to secure food for
about one week, maybe ten days if they saved up some of it.</P><P>“Will
you tell me what happened?”</P><P>Olette
had known that Naminè would ask. After all, she almost died, and
Naminè probably too, in the process of saving her.</P><P>“I
don't really want to tell you, but I guess I should. You have to
promise me that you won't ask me about details.”</P><P>Olette
was still hesitating about telling Naminè what happened, but they
had now food for a while and she couldn't go out anyway. They would
have plenty of time to talk this out. But that was the problem:
Olette wasn't that great at arguing.</P><P>Naminè
gave a nod and looked closely at Olette. She didn't want her to get
hurt anymore, even if that meant to shoulder some of the burden
Olette was obviously carrying.</P><P>Slowly,
Naminè got more and more a hold of how the world really was, and
even though she still didn't understand a whole lot of it, one thing
was really obvious. The world was not as bright a place as she had
imagined. Knowing only Hollow Bastion after her confinement by
Organization XIII, she figured that everywhere was like that. But
now, she knew that the world, every world, had its dark side too.</P><P>“I
got that box at the harbor. It's natural that they don't leave a box
full of food for a voyage unguarded. I knocked one of the guards out
and the other opened fire. I didn't get hit badly, but one bullet got
my arm, and even though it was only a graze, it didn't stop bleeding.
I used the ground to set off a explosion with Hero's Crest and one of
the stone shrapnels must've hit my leg. In the end, I ran for it with
the box.”</P><P>Olette
took a deep breath and feared what Naminè might say now. She
certainly wouldn't be happy that Olette stole the food and on top of
it, knocked out two men and got severely injured. With a depressed
expression, she looked at the ground, wanting to avoid what Naminè
might now think of her.</P><P>Naminè
understood what Olette was saying. Even she knew that one couldn't
just take food from other people, even if they were in a dire
situation. But looking at the depressed Olette, she could understand
how she felt. It must've been hard to shoulder the burden of
committing such acts over the recent days all alone.</P><P>Naminè
abstained from saying anything, just leaned onto Olette, reaching for
her hand and caressing it. Olette
didn't seem to involve Naminè in such shady business, and the blond
girl was grateful for that. Naminè really didn't want to
steal from people, but they had to eat. If all Naminè could do for
Olette was to keep quiet and support her, then that was what she
would do.</P><P>“You
aren't going to yell at me?” Olette asked.</P><P>“I
won't. You do this to keep us alive, I understand that. And no matter
what you think of yourself, I know you're a good person.”</P><P>That
was quite unexpected, coming from someone like Naminè.</P><P>Maybe
it really was time to take her a bit more seriously. After all, she
did seem to gradually mature more, especially over the past days.
Well, it really would be worrying if she didn't.</P><P>They
continued to sit there, silently spending time with each other,
healing their wounds, resting their minds and even a bit enjoying the
sound of the rain on the roof. With a full stomach and in good
knowledge the other one was okay, the rain didn't seem to be as
annoying as it was before.</P><P>“I'm
happy I met you and Kairi,” Naminè said after over a hour of
silence.</P><P>Olette
had thought Naminè had fallen asleep, so this took her by surprise.
Of course she was happy that she had met those two, even though she
only came recently to notice how much she liked Naminè.</P><P>Back
in Twilight Town, she had been lonely even among her friends. Now,
she wasn't lonely anymore, with even just one friend.</P><P>“I
feel the same way...although I must admit, I first found you a bit
annoying and somewhat of a spoiled brat,” Olette said, and made a
funny expression.</P><P>Naminè
immediately started sulking and looked in another direction. It was a
very obvious act, so obvious that Olette started laughing
wholeheartedly. It had been really long time since she'd laughed, and
considering that Kairi was still lost, and they trapped in a foreign
world, it was an amazing feat.</P><P>Even
Naminè joined the laugher, although hers was more of a cute
giggling, and in the end, they both laid down, looking at each other.</P><P>“If
Kairi saw us like this, she would think we're lovers or something,”
Olette said, her thoughts getting entangled in moments on the island
she had shared with Kairi.</P><P>Naminè
got quiet for a moment. She looked away and rolled over, now
observing the roof. Even though the stable was old, the roof was
waterproof and the dark-brown wood gave it a soothing feeling.</P><P>“Ah,
I didn't mean it like that. I mean...you...you're really cute,
but...” Olette was struggling with her words.</P><P>“I
know. It's just I really miss her, and...”</P><P>Naminè
had thought about it once before. What if Kairi decided against her?
What if Kairi decided in her favor? What would happen to the bond she
shared with Olette right now? Naminè didn't want to lose Olette as a
friend, even if that meant her relationship with Kairi remained like
it was now. That thought frightened her for a moment.</P><P>“I
feel the same...I...think I love Kairi, no, I...I should have
realized it. I do love her. I don't have the right to interfere with
your and Kairi's—”
Olette was cut off by Naminè.</P><P>“Don't
say it like that! I don't want to lose you as a friend...”</P><P>For
Olette, this was the first time she had seen Naminè this serious. It
was a bit shocking that their thoughts were the same to such a
degree.</P><P>“But
why do we have to choose anyway?” Naminè complained, and once
again rolled over, now looking at Olette.</P><P>“I
told you, to love someone is special. I've never been in love before,
but...I just can't imagine that you can love two people that easily.
And—” Olette was again
cut off.</P><P>“But
why is it like that? Wouldn't it be better if you could just love two
people? If Kairi could do that, then...” Naminè muttered the rest
of the sentence so hushedly that Olette couldn't understand it.</P><P>“I
don't think it is that easy...I do think it would be better, but...”
Olette got depressed by how persistent Naminè was. Just what was she
thinking? It seemed like a impossible thing to her, to love two
people equally. Or even for someone to tolerate that their partner
loved someone else.</P><P>“If
Kairi...”</P><P>“Even
if she could love two people...you and someone else...would <I>you</I>

be okay with that?”</P><P>Olette
didn't name herself on purpose. If Naminè could not accept that, she
was afraid of hurting their friendship.</P><P>“If
it was you, I think...”</P><P>Naminè
blushed while saying it, and Olette couldn't help but think how cute
she looked like that. It took her a few seconds until she fully
comprehended what Naminè was saying.</P><P>Olette
failed to understand how Naminè could say such a thing. But at the
same time, she was a bit embarrassed that Naminè trusted her that
much.</P><P>Naminè
looked confused for a moment, then averted her face, feeling a bit
embarrassed. It was a first for her to feel like that, but it was
also weird to say something like that.</P><P>Olette
would never even spend a single thought on that. Naminè wouldn't
mind sharing Kairi with her? But did she really feel like that? Would
anyone even be able to do that? In the end, one of them would always
end up hating the other. Wasn't that common sense?</P><P>She
couldn't respond. Would Olette mind sharing Kairi with Naminè? That
was...if Kairi really came to like both of them, which was so very
unlikely that Olette felt silly just thinking about this.</P><P>But
Naminè was really close to her, much closer than anyone else she
knew. Closer than Kairi, even. She...was in love with Kairi, but her
bond with Naminè was much deeper, but only on a friendship level.</P><P>Olette
spent a few minutes thinking about it. Right, she had felt annoyed,
maybe unconsciously jealous, of how easy it seemed for Naminè to
flirt with Kairi, even if it was one-sided. But she had been clearly
jealous when Kairi told her Naminè had kissed her.</P><P>But
that was before all this. Before their fight for survival, before
their caring for each other, before they started comforting each
other. In a sense, so much had changed over the past few days that it
amazed Olette now that she started thinking about it.</P><P>Would
she not feel anxious about Naminè snatching away Kairi in the end?
Would she not fear that Naminè and Kairi betrayed her?</P><P>Her
thoughts were a mess, and it really bothered her. Olette was getting
a headache and looked down, right into the pure eyes of Naminè. No.
There was no doubt. Naminè would not betray her like that. She was
just paranoid because all of her friends had been false ones in the
past.</P><P>She
couldn't say it. Couldn't say she would not mind sharing Kairi. She
cursed her own weakness, cursed how helpless she was, in situations
like these.</P><P>“You
don't need to say anything, Olette,” Naminè said, getting closer.
The night had come, and it was getting colder by the minute. They
usually slept together to keep each other warm. But Naminè was much
closer than ever before.</P><P>Laying
her petite arms around Olette's waist, she let her head rest on
Olette's chest, smiling. She could feel that Olette was fighting with
her mind, but it seemed really painful. All because she had said
something careless.</P><P>“Even...even
if Kairi won't be able to like both of us, I won't ever stop being
your friend. You're important to me, Olette. If Kairi only can like
one of us, I'd rather stay only friends with both of you than to lose
one.”</P><P>Naminè
was talking in such a gentle and quiet voice, it was like a reflex
for Olette to pet her head and gave a smile, even though she could
not see it. She was right. If Kairi decided on only one of them, if
it was her, she would step down. Even if it meant temporarily hurting
Kairi, if that preserved their friendship, it was the right choice.</P><P>“I
feel the same way. I don't want to lose either of you, I need both of
you. Yes, I need you, Naminè.”</P><P>It
did sound sort of like a love confession, and made her slightly
blush, but it felt good to finally say it.</P><P>Both
of them smiled to themselves, happily knowing the other one wouldn't
go after Kairi behind the other's back.</P><P>They
were tired and worn out, exhausted both physically and mentally. They
just fell asleep like they were, close to each other, sharing the
warmth of the straw.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>The
sound of liquids simmering in several experimental capsules and the
smell of death occupied the room. Protected from any light, almost
wrapped in complete darkness but the lights of the instruments,
showing steady process. One man, standing on the only table in the
center of the room, was working on whatever laid on that table.</P><P>Left
and right, to both sides, were experimental capsules with parts of
what once were fellow members of Organization XIII, now just mere
parts of a corpse. There were numerous parts, each in its own tube,
labeled with just numbers.</P><P>Something
stepped into the room, and a faint shimmer of light grazed the table.
The body of a woman. Unmoving and cold, incomplete and broken.</P><P>“What
is the process?”</P><P>A
too-familiar voice. Cold and uncaring, brutal and going past any
defense or act. That was he, the Lunar Dancer, Saix, the Monster of
Cocidius.</P><P>“This
is much harder than you'd imagine. Tell the Superior I will need time
to complete this.”</P><P>“I
will.”</P><P>If
Saix had been quiet before, he now was ridiculously silent and
awkward to be around. He now was just a cold beast that could tear
one apart any moment.</P><P>“Luxord
has been sent to the world where he last saw the Keyblader. You have
time until he returns to finish this.”</P><P>The
man on the table gave out a offended sigh and looked at the display
of test tube number two. It was almost ready.</P><P>If
he could accomplish this, the Organization would gain a lot of power,
maybe even the possibility of seizing control of the Keyblades
themselves, advancing their plan to the last stage much faster than
anticipated.</P><P>“We
will watch you, Xigbar.”</P><P>“You
do not need to tell me that, Saix.”</P><P>Another
being stepped into the room, standing next to Saix, its hood up,
hiding its face.</P><P>“The
Superior calls for you.”</P><P>“I
understand.”</P><P>The
entity whose face was hidden was looking firmly at Xigbar. He did not
hate him, but he did not like him either. He was just the replacement
for Zexion. It was his job to do what he was ordered to. But this
time, even he was disturbed by what the Superior had ordered him to
do.</P><P>“Something
else?” Xigbar turned around, watching the being, still standing
there in absolute silence, almost merging with the darkness in the
room.</P><P>No
answer. It just turned around and slowly left the room. There was
nothing on his mind. Too much thinking was dangerous.</P><P>Xigbar
resumed work and took out one of his needles, stabbing the body in
front of him. There was no blood and the density was lower than that
of a human body.</P><P>He
had to find a way out. He knew too much. Xemnas soon would want to
dispose of him, at the very least, when he achieved his goal of
seizing a Keyblade.</P><P>Or
maybe he could regain Xemnas' favor. What if he proved to be a
valuable tool, even for something that was as inhuman as Xemnas?</P><P>Another
needle found its way in the body in front of him. He was not grossed
out by his work, such thoughts had long vanished, along with every
moral and scruple.</P><P>“Soon
you will have your chance for revenge.”</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Olette
and Naminè spent most of their time resting to conserve food and
energy and talking about several things—some
trivial, some relevant, such as how they would look for Kairi once
they were back to good health. The food had proven to be very
helpful. Even after one week, when Olette had regained full health
and mobility, they had two days' worth left over. Nonetheless, Olette
insisted on looking for more. They didn't know how long they had to
remain there.</P><P>Naminè
agreed after Olette promised to be more careful. Naminè had started
working on their place to sleep, and even though she had very limited
knowledge, with Olette's help they managed to use some planks and the
almost empty box to create a poor imitation of a huge bed filled with
straw.</P><P>It
was helpful, as it was more comfortable to sleep that way, but also
wasted a lot of their energy.</P><P>Naminè
had gotten considerably better, and was able to use magic on a
regular basis now, even though there was little need for it. They
planned to clean out a empty animal box and use that in the future
for a fireplace. Naminè was of the opinion that Olette was planning
too far ahead, as they would only need a fire in winter. Even so,
they had no utensils to cook with or anything of that sort.</P><P>“We
don't know how long we have to stay here. Maybe for months. It
doesn't hurt to be prepared,” Olette always insisted, but they
never gave up on finding Kairi.</P><P>Olette
managed, secretly and in the deep of the night, to break open a
storehouse that was used for ships that came and left a lot—basically
merchant ships—and stole
two boxes' worth of food. Too much, and the villagers would hunt them
down no matter how long it took, but this much would get them over
another week or two.</P><P>It
was long past four weeks since they had arrived in this town when
Olette woke up in the middle of a night. The sky was filled with
flames, and screams were audible through the whole town. A terrible
sensation made Olette tremble. This was not just a simple fire.</P><P>“Naminè,
wake up!” Olette woke the blond girl quite harshly, but this
situation didn't allow any unnecessary delay.</P><P>“Why
did you wake me up, Olette...? It's still dark...” Naminè noticed
that it wasn't dark out. Outside, there were flames and terror.</P><P>“You
can fight, right?”</P><P>Naminè
just gave a nod; she looked outside the window and summoned
Monochrome. Olette instantaneously summoned both Hero's Crest and
Circle of Life. Not wasting any time, she jumped straight out the
window.</P><P>Naminè
was unable to do such a near-impossible physical act without getting
hurt and went the long way, over the ladder. There was no saying when
the stable would catch fire. With all the straw inside, it was like a
match waiting to ignite.</P><P>Olette
stood there in awe. The streets were polluted by Heartless and
Nobodies, dead bodies on every corner. But Heartless consumed the
bodies of people themselves, along with their hearts. Who would slay
everyone, children and adults likewise?</P><P>Just
then, a pirate came out of the house right next to them, carrying
everything valuable he could find. He held his bloodstained saber in
his mouth, his eyes greedily shimmering and reflecting the fire,
giving him a devilish look.</P><P>It
was not in Olette's nature to have the urge to kill, and against her
principles too, but there was no restraint left in her after seeing a
massacre right before her eyes. Right. This was reality. This was the
influence the darkness and the Heartless had on the humans. Death and
destruction.</P><P>But
before Olette could even attempt to run in the direction of the
pirate, right behind her, the stable—their
home—was set on fire. It
had not naturally caught fire, as not one building around it was
burning. No. <I>Someone</I> had caused that.</P><P>Naminè
was first to sense the enemy. Pushing Olette out of the way, she
jumped aside, taking cover from what was coming. A giant fireball hit
the ground and left nothing but burnt black earth at the point where
they had just been standing.</P><P>Naminè
got away without any injuries and Olette had just a few scorched
hairs, but they now knew where the enemy was.</P><P>Ten
feet above the burning stable, wrapped in the flames and unaffected,
smiling devilishly and floating in mid-air.</P><P>“<I>Welcome
to the Game!</I>”</P>
