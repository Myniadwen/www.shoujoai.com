<a href="../kinghart/valiant2-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><p align='center'><I>Awakening
- </I></P><p align='center'><I>Crossroads</I></P><P>Olette
had spent the last two days with Yuffie and had no intention of going
back home for now. She couldn't stay at Yuffie's place forever, but
it was a nice time being there, and the brunette didn't want it to
end yet. She had skipped Tifa's training twice in a row now.</P><P>“Really?
She kissed you?”</P><P>Yuffie
was lying on top of a wall, looking at the sky and talking with
Olette, who sat next to her, looking down at her.</P><P>“Stop
saying it as if it were intentional! I told you that she was sleeping
and she just happened to move over and—”</P><P>“I
bet you were all blushing and red and embarrassed and—”</P><P>“Yuffie!
You're a terrible tease, seriously. I don't feel like that about her
and you know that!”</P><P>Olette
was complaining and Yuffie once again started laughing and turned
over to avoid seeing the tomboy's fierce red face.</P><P>“Yeah,
sure. Maybe I should tell Kairi, I wonder what she'd say about—”</P><P>Yuffie
put a hand on her mouth, but it was too late. Olette was still a bit
sensitive when it came to Kairi, and the trickster had tried not to
talk about her. It was nice and fun teasing Olette, but not if she
got depressed over it.</P><P>“Ah,
sorry. I didn't mean to—”</P><P>“I'm
fine. Really. But I'm so not going to forgive you if you tell Naminè
that she...me by accident!”</P><P>Olette
whispered “kissed” and jumped on top of Yuffie, starting to
tickle her. Olette had learned that Yuffie's weak spots were her ribs
and she mercilessly abused that knowledge to punish her for being a
tease.</P><P>“Ah,
stop it, stop it, I give up.” Yuffie was laughing with tears in her
eyes.</P><P>Olette
stopped on request and went back to her sitting position, looking
over the town. Yuffie had told her about the time the Heartless had
taken over Hollow Bastion. It was unbelievable that the town was
already this peaceful.</P><P>“I
thought I was gonna die.” Yuffie was breathing heavily, still lying
on the wall.</P><P>Olette
grinned and looked down at Yuffie. They hadn't done much the last two
days but lazily lay around and work on some of Yuffie's tools. It
wasn't anything special, but Olette enjoyed her time with Yuffie.</P><P>“You
still owe me for letting you stay at my place,” Yuffie started out
of nowhere.</P><P>Olette
knew. But she had no money, so what else could Yuffie want?</P><P>“I'm
gonna take my pay for today. Close your eyes for a moment.”</P><P>That
couldn't be anything good, but she was used to Yuffie's teasing by
now. It wasn't that bad, really, but sometimes the ninja was quite
the sadist.</P><P>Closing
her eyes, Olette could feel Yuffie getting into an upright position
next to her. Would she tackle her off the wall? That was dangerous;
even Yuffie wouldn't do that. Tickle her? Olette wasn't really weak
to that. What...</P><P>Something
was really close to her face and breathing on it. Out of reflex,
Olette opened her eyes, looked directly into Yuffie's peridot eyes,
and backed away from her without thinking. Yuffie acted faster than
Olette. She lay one hand on her neck and pulled Olette towards her.</P><P>Olette
hadn't really kissed anyone before, but even though Yuffie seemed
forceful, it wasn't like that at all. It was the opposite, the
black-haired girl was really gentle and cautious. It was a nice
feeling. Yuffie's lips weren't especially soft or anything, but to
Olette, they did seem that way. It took her a few seconds to realize
what was going on—that Yuffie was kissing her—to make her finally
pull away.</P><P>She
wanted to be angry, wanted to give Yuffie a evil glare, but things
didn't work that way. With a surprised look and blushing like a ripe
tomato, Olette looked at the ninja who was smiling like a rainbow.</P><P>“What
wa—”</P><P>Yuffie
hold a finger upright before her face. “Payment, lovely, payment.
Or rather, first rate.”</P><P>Olette
went back to a normal color and sighed. That was Yuffie alright. But
to kiss her...!</P><P>“Sexual
harassment.”</P><P>Yuffie
was looking a bit confused. “What?”</P><P>“Sexual
harassment. You kissed me without my consent and—”</P><P>“You
seemed to quite enjoy it. That's plenty of consent.” Yuffie was
back to smiling in a mean way.</P><P>Olette
couldn't argue with that. She had enjoyed it. And it wasn't so bad,
actually. She just wanted to tease Yuffie.</P><P>“And
the next time you're going to grope me, huh?” Olette could be mean
too.</P><P>“You
sure are bold. I can do it right now if you want.” But Yuffie was
on a different level.</P><P>Slightly
blushing, Olette turned around, crossing her arms before her chest.
She never knew when Yuffie was serious and when not. Better not take
the risk.</P><P>“Don't
worry, I'm not gonna do that.” Yuffie waved her hand and whispered
something to herself.</P><P>“You
just said 'not here anyway', didn't you!” Olette slowly backed away
from Yuffie.</P><P>“Maybe.”</P><P>The
devil. Yuffie was the devil. But Olette liked her anyway. It never
got boring with her around.</P><P>“Want
to go and watch Naminè's training?”</P><P>Yuffie
seemed to think about it for quite a few minutes. Olette was looking
at the clouds that were slowly flowing with the wind far above them.
The sky was a wonderful blue that day.</P><P>No
answer came. Olette looked down on Yuffie's face and she had her eyes
closed. Was she thinking? Or...</P><P>“Don't
pretend to be asleep or I'm gonna throw you off the wall,” Olette
said in a purposefully cold tone.</P><P>“Yeah,
let's go.” Yuffie was wide awake and smiled awkwardly.</P><P>“You
go first. Who knows what you'll do to me when I let you behind me,
you pervert.”</P><P>Yuffie
sighed and went first, jumping from the wall onto a nearby roof. From
there she leapt onto a pile of boxes and onto the ground. Olette
followed after and kept an eye on Yuffie. She hadn't made a big deal
out of the kiss because she hadn't really minded. It had felt nice
and she even slept together with her in a bed.</P><P>“Want
to make a bet?” Yuffie was saying.</P><P>“Why
not? What are the stakes and what about?”</P><P>“Whoever's
first at the canyon and touches Naminè,” Yuffie said, and starting
running.</P><P>Olette
was confused for a moment, but then noticed that the ninja hadn't
mentioned what the stakes were. But she wouldn't lose to Yuffie,
whatever the odds were. Olette started running and had almost caught
up with Yuffie when she started shouting something.</P><P>“If
I win, you have to go on a date with me.”</P><P>Olette
was so surprised that she lost her balance and hit the ground, Yuffie
laughing and getting away. By the time Olette got up, Yuffie was not
in sight.</P><P>“Now
she's done it.”</P><P>Summoning
both of her Keyblades, Olette utilized her full power and made a
astonishing run for it. Yuffie was evil to the core for pulling such
a trick to get an advantage over Olette.</P><P>At
the entrance to the canyon, Olette finally caught up with Yuffie, who
looked rather amazed that she had managed to get there that fast.
However, going at full power took its toll, and Olette and Yuffie
ran, neck and neck, towards Naminè and Aerith, who were in the
middle of training.</P><P>“If
I win, you have to pay me a thousand munny for each time you tease me
for one week.”</P><P>“You're
insane!” Yuffie shouted and went ahead of Olette.</P><P>Aerith
and Naminè had already noticed the two girls that were running
towards them like mad. Naminè was in the middle of a fire spell when
Yuffie and Olette simultaneously jumped towards her, causing Naminè
to lose control of the spell that detonated right over them, causing
a huge dust cloud.</P><P>“I
won!” Olette was shouting.</P><P>“No,
I did!” Yuffie replied.</P><P>When
the dust cloud vanished, an angry Naminè was squashed under Yuffie
and Olette, who both had landed directly on top of her. While Olette
had grabbed her shoulder, Yuffie had gotten a hold of a leg.</P><P>“Get
off of me, now!” Naminè shouted, and both girls got up, amazed by
that outburst.</P><P>“What
are you girls doing?” Aerith was confused and looked rather angrily
at Yuffie and Olette.</P><P>“A
bet. Who'd be the fastest to run down from the living quarter and
touch Naminè,” Yuffie explained. “And I won.”</P><P>“You
didn't. Naminè, tell her,” Olette defended herself.</P><P>“You
both crashed into me out of nowhere. How am I supposed to tell
anything?!” Naminè said angrily, turning around.</P><P>“We're
in the middle of training. Olette, Tifa wants to talk with you. You
really shouldn't skip her training. She is worried about you.”</P><P>Olette
felt guilty, but didn't really want to go to training. Tifa would
surely ask her about Kairi and she wanted to avoid that.</P><P>“Let's
consider this a draw and get out of here before Naminè blows us up,”
Yuffie whispered.</P><P>“Sorry
about that, Naminè. See you later!” Olette shouted, and ran off
with Yuffie.</P><P>“Those
two...nothing but nonsense on their minds,” Aerith grumbled, and
helped Naminè clean dust off her dress.</P><P>“But
they seem to get along fine,” Naminè said.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“It's
your fault that Naminè is angry with me.” Olette seemed really
cold and distant.</P><P>“You
accepted the bet, and you also crashed into her. Don't give me all
the blame.”</P><P>Olette
only sighed and ordered a coffee from the waitress that was walking
by. “Put some milk in it, please.”</P><P>Yuffie
leaned forward and flicked Olette's forehead. She couldn't stand
being ignored.</P><P>“Ouch.
What was that for?”</P><P>“Ignoring
me. I don't like that.”</P><P>Olette
made an angry face, and without further notice, leaned forward and
also snipped Yuffie's forehead.</P><P>“What
do we do about the bet?” Yuffie was asking, rubbing her forehead.</P><P>“You
didn't bet on anything, and we don't know who won anyway,” Olette
said, taking her coffee from the waitress.</P><P>“Of
course I did. If I win, you're going on a date with me, I said.”</P><P>Olette
almost spat her coffee out. That hadn't been just a taunt? Yuffie was
serious about that?</P><P>“You
could just have asked to go on a date, tch.” Olette sighed.</P><P>She
didn't really mean it. It would have been really weird to have Yuffie
ask her out on a date. She had never been on a date, and with Yuffie,
that would be a hell of permanent teasing.</P><P>“Go
on a date with me, will ya?”</P><P>Olette
was so surprised that she swallowed way too much of the hot coffee
and started coughing. Who in her right mind would ask bluntly like
that right after the other party told so?</P><P>“I
was joking!” Olette said, still coughing.</P><P>“And
I'm serious. I thought you'd decline if I asked like this, so I made
it a bet. I'd say we had a draw. You go on a date with me, and I
won't tease you at all that day.”</P><P>“It
was a week! And a thousand munny for each time you would!” Olette
started arguing.</P><P>“Do
you really want that? Would be kind of boring.” Yuffie knew that
Olette didn't really mind as much as she made it seem.</P><P>“Okay,
you win.”</P><P>Olette
sighed and took a nip of coffee.</P><P>“Hey,
Rydia, do you know if Cid finally got around to repairing the
cinema?”</P><P>“I
doubt it. He's been working on something else.”</P><P>“Tch.
Useless Cid. Well, I asked for the date, so I'm gonna figure out what
we can do. Most things are still being repaired. I never asked, but
what are your hobbies?”</P><P>Olette
couldn't decide if she was amazed by Yuffie's bluntness or simply
amused by it. Either way, it didn't look like the date would be all
that bad. Yuffie seemed really serious about it.</P><P>“I
spent most of my time playing Struggle...err...I'll explain that
another time...and sitting on a hill, watching trains come and go. I
always wanted to go to the beach back there, but never made it.”</P><P>“The
beach, huh? Never been there in this world.”</P><P>“Don't
stress yourself. The date isn't today. I decided to drop by Tifa's to
do some training. I feel bad about skipping out.”</P><P>“You're
such a good girl, it's blinding me!” Yuffie covered her eyes with
her hand, as if Olette was emitting a bright light.</P><P>“Way
to exaggerate. I'll see you later, Yuffie. Take care of the bill for
me, okay?”</P><P>“Wait!”
Yuffie shouted, but Olette was already gone.</P><P>“Should
I put it on your tab, Yuffie?” Rydia rolled her eyes, but she was
smiling.</P><P>“Yeah...”
The ninja sighed, and started thinking.</P><P>“The
beach, huh?”</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“She's
back, Aerith.”</P><P>“Olette,
we're still training. You barely left here half an hour ago,”
Aerith said, looking a bit annoyed.</P><P>“I
decided to stop skipping training. Do you know where Tifa is?”</P><P>“Probably
home, being lazy.” Aerith rolled her eyes.</P><P>“I'll
check. Thanks.”</P><P>“I
hope Tifa will be busy again. The last two days she cooked out of
boredom. My stomach still hurts,” Naminè said.</P><P>“Don't
let her hear that. I love her food, but I understand if it's a tad
too spicy for you girls.” Aerith giggled for a moment.</P><P>Naminè
gave a nod and took a deep breath. The training had gotten harder
after they had come back from their trip to Port Royal, which is what
Leon decided the world would be called.</P><P>Naminè
had gotten better as well. She was able to repeatedly use grade two
instantaneous magic and was learning more difficult types of magic
like lightning and gravity now. There were a lot of problems with
gravity magic, as it proved to be really incompatible with Naminé.
She was rather skilled with fire, ice, and cure, but she was really
bad with gravity.</P><P>“We'll
only try a few more times and then stop for today. You've worked
really hard the last two days. You can take it easy today.”</P><P>“Thanks.
I want to support Kairi, and I need to become stronger for that.”</P><P>Aerith
smiled. She was thinking of how Naminè reminded her of Tifa, who
always worked hard to get stronger to help Cloud. Hoping that things
wouldn't turn out like they had with Tifa and Cloud, Aerith resumed
training with her apprentice.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“Don't
wanna.”</P><P>Tifa
was lying on the couch and listening to music that could only be
described as very loud guitar and yelling. Olette was standing behind
her, talking to her. It had cost her quite a bit of effort to go in,
but it hadn't felt all that bad to see this place after a few days of
not being there.</P><P>“Oh,
come on. I know I shouldn't have skipped training, but I really
wasn't in any condition to go.”</P><P>“Look,
how about you tell me you're sorry that you left here without a word
and stayed at Yuffie's place? And then you skipped training too. I
didn't hear one word from you telling us what happened or even that
you'd be staying at Yuffie's place,” Tifa said, totally indifferent
towards Olette.</P><P>“I
don't suppose if I say sorry now it will do anything.” Olette
looked at the ground with a guilty expression.</P><P>“No.
If you want to show me you're sorry, just stay there and wait.”</P><P>Olette
stood there, waiting. Five minutes passed without Tifa even moving a
finger. The longer she listened to the music, the better it sounded.
There was a rhythm to it, a melody, but it was much more powerful
than anything she had ever heard.</P><P>“What's
this music called?”</P><P>“You're
still here?!” Tifa abruptly looked over her shoulder. “Metal.
Heavy metal, to be accurate.”</P><P>“It's
not bad, but you really need to get used to it,” Olette said,
liking it better with each second.</P><P>“You
think so? Aerith hates my music, so I only ever listen to it when she
is out.”</P><P>Tifa
seemed to be more interested in talking to Olette about music than
seeing her being sorry.</P><P>“Yeah.
Now that I listen to it...guitar, bass, drums...is that another
guitar in there?” Olette was observing the music with her ears.</P><P>“You've
got good ears. And good taste.” Looking at the clock, it was still
about two hours until Aerith came back from training with Naminè.
That was plenty of time.</P><P>“Take
a seat. I'll show you one of my favorite tracks.” Tifa went up and
changed one CD for another.</P><P>Loud
and strong guitar riffs came out of the boxes. A female vocalist was
singing. The lyrics were interesting, to say the least.</P><P><I>Go
now, if you want it</I></P><P><I>Another
world awaits you</I></P><P><I>Don't
you give up on it</I></P><P><I>You
bite the hand that feeds you</I></P><P>“What's
this band called?” Olette was now sitting on the couch, next to
Tifa, who was lying on the couch with closed eyes, enjoying the
music.</P><P>“The
White Mages. They're an awesome band, one of the best.”</P><P>“Never
heard of them,” Olette answered truthfully. But she liked the
music, the sound of it. “I wish I could play like that.”</P><P>Tifa
started laughing and then took a deep breath. “Don't think about
it. Playing an instrument is hard work. I used to play the piano, way
back in my own world, but I haven't touched one in many years. Aerith
tells me it's a pity, she really likes the piano.”</P><P>“How
about this track?” The previous song had ended and a new, more
powerful song played, which went higher and higher, only to just
suddenly drop.</P><P>“It's
awesome. What's its name?”</P><P>“'The
Decisive Battle.' There are no vocals like in most of the songs from
The Black Mages, but they're still damn good.”</P><P>The
name reminded Olette of why she had come here in the first place. She
wanted go get back intro training.</P><P>“Tifa,
listen, I—”</P><P>“Psh.
Be quiet and enjoy the music.” Tifa made an annoyed face. It was
one of her rare chances to listen to her music without Aerith nagging
her about it.</P><P>Olette
didn't dare to speak up again, she didn't want to lose the sympathy
Tifa had found for her.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“You're
spacing out, Kairi. Training is over for today. I can't have you like
this. Get yourself together. You have the weekend off, so use the
time,” Leon said, and walked off.</P><P>Deep
down, he was worried about her. It wasn't like her to space out like
this. Not like her at all.</P><P>“Shit...it's
still bothering me,” Kairi swore, and kicked a rock.
Dematerializing Oathkeeper, she looked to the sky. She didn't feel
like doing anything for now. She felt like just going home and lying
down. She had to come up with a way to be friends with Olette again.
But that was much easier said than done.</P><P>While
walking back, Kairi bumped into Naminè, who apparently had finished
her training as well.</P><P>“Aerith
isn't with you?”</P><P>“She's
shopping for dinner. One more day of Tifa's food and we'll die, I
told her.”</P><P>“Better
not let Tifa hear that,” Kairi giggled.</P><P>“I
won't.” Naminè joined Kairi's giggle.</P><P>Things
were mostly back to before, except they weren't awkward at all. Kairi
knew that whatever she did, Naminè wouldn't stop wanting to go out
with her. She might as well get along with her and tell her whenever
she got too close. It had worked pretty well so far, and Kairi didn't
even need to tell Naminè anything. It was better than in the
beginning, even.</P><P>“Leon
literally kicked me out. Tomorrow and the whole weekend I won't have
training, only enough time to sort out my thoughts.”</P><P>“Will
you tell me what's on your mind?” Naminè asked, and stopped.</P><P>“You
know what's on my mind, Naminè.” Kairi turned around and looked at
the blonde girl.</P><P>“But
I want you to tell me, not to guess at your feelings.”</P><P>“It
bothers me that Olette seems to be avoiding me now. I hope it won't
stay like this. I like her.” With a swift gaze at Naminè, she
added, “as a friend.”</P><P>“I
know. You can't think of us as anything but friends. For now, that is
fine. But one day, I will change your feelings.”</P><P>Kairi
blushed and turned her back on Naminè. “You hang out with Aerith
too much. You almost sound like her now. “</P><P>“You
think so? I like Aerith. I don't think it's a bad thing to be like
her.” Naminè walked past Kairi and looked over her shoulder,
smiling at the redhead.</P><P>“Let's
go home, Kairi. I sure hope Tifa hasn't started cooking yet...”</P><P>Kairi
nodded, took a deep breath, and walked forward.</P><P>She
was right, Naminè was right. People couldn't read her mind. She had
to talk to them to make them understand. It felt much better now that
Naminè had spoken openly about her interest in her. The pressure was
gone, and it didn't feel awkward to be with her.</P><P>“There
is some awesome noise coming from our house.” Naminè pointed in
the direction their house was.</P><P>“I
guess that's Tifa, listening to her music at maximum volume. She
always does that when Aerith is out of the house. I don't mind the
music, but she turns up the volume too far. Worse, she refuses to
turn the volume down. Let's go to the Sand Pearl.”</P><P>“The
Sand Pearl?” Naminè asked, slightly confused.</P><P>“Rydia's
coffee shop. I guess you don't know yet. I often go there when I need
to think.”</P><P>“I
don't think I want to expose myself to music of that volume...so
yeah, let's go.”</P><P>Naminè
took Kairi's hand as if it were only natural to do so and smiled.
Kairi averted her eyes but didn't take her hand away. Acting distant
towards Naminè really hurt for some reason.</P><P>“At
least I can hold your hand without you snapping, unlike when I first
got here,” Naminè teased the redhead.</P><P>“You
didn't just 'hold my hand' back when you first got here,” Kairi
teased back, giving Naminè such an overly serious glare that they
both started laughing.</P><P>“I
hope you can get along with Olette. I don't think she simply gave up
on you.”</P><P>Kairi
sighed, remembering the scene from two days ago. She hadn't figured
out how to deal with the problem yet. For now, all she could do was
wait for Olette to forgive her.</P><P>“Don't
let it bother you too much. Olette is really, really tough. She won't
give up from just that.”</P><P>“That's
what you think, Naminè. She looked really disappointed back there. I
feel still horrible when I imagine her face.”</P><P>Naminè
stopped and stared at Kairi with a very unusually serious look.
“Kairi, absolutely nothing good will come out of beating yourself
up over this.”</P><P>Kairi
was puzzled for a moment and looked oddly at Naminè. “Aerith told
you to say that, didn't she?” Kairi smiled a little evilly, but it
was a smile nonetheless.</P><P>“You
figured it out already? That's so unfair,” Naminè complained.</P><P>“It's
not like you to say something like that. But it's very like Aerith.
You're influenced by her too much.” Kairi started teasing her
again.</P><P>“You
could use some influence from her too. At least you could be more
open about your feelings then!” Naminè let her hand go and took a
few steps forward.</P><P>“...what
direction is the Sand Pearl in?” Naminè asked without turning
around.</P><P>“Not
only influence from Aerith but from Olette too. Jeez, you get
influenced too easily,” Kairi said, and stepped up to the blonde
girl.</P><P>“Influence
this, influence that, you sound like a broken record!” Naminè
said, and turned around, a wide smile on her face.</P><P>“Aren't
you worse for liking a broken record?”</P><P>“Meanie!”
Naninè couldn't hold back any longer and started giggling.</P><P>“My
pleasure,” Kairi said and bowed, joining her giggling.</P><P>“We're
terrible actors,” Naminè said, taking Kairi's hand again.</P><P>“I
know. Doesn't stop us, though.”</P><P>Kairi
led the way and Naminè saw the Sand Pearl for the first time.</P><P>“Rydia
is a really nice woman. She was here even before Leon and the others.
She lost her home world to the Heartless like most people here.”</P><P>“Are
all people in Hollow Bastion from other worlds?” Naminè was a bit
astonished.</P><P>“Most
are. Ansem the Wise brought them to this world, and they built this
place to give people who lost their world a home.” Kairi made a
short break. “That's what Aerith told me.”</P><P>She
had met Ansem, and he was by no means a wise man. He had been
corrupted by darkness and had tried to destroy the worlds, to engulf
them in darkness. Even the highest minds could fall deep.</P><P>“Is
it hard for you?”</P><P>Kairi
stopped, not knowing what Naminé was getting at.</P><P>“I
know you're pushing yourself to act like this. It feels odd for you
to play along. I don't want you to keep doing that. It's...weird.”
Naminè averted her eyes.</P><P>Kairi
looked at the ground and let go of Naminè. She was right, she wasn't
being her usual self, but how could she be? Olette was still upset
with her.</P><P>“You're
right. But I wanted to stop running away from my problems. I've never
been to anyone what you want to be for me.”</P><P>“That
doesn't mean you have to stop being yourself. I like you for who you
are, Kairi. Not for who you right now pretend to be.”</P><P>“...I
see.”</P><P>Naminè
walked past Kairi, again smiling. “Just be yourself.”</P><P>Kairi's
thoughts were a mess. Was it wrong to try her hardest to live up to
Naminé's expectations? She wanted to get along with her, but now
Naminè told her she should stop pushing herself so hard. Why?</P><P>“You're
thinking too hard again. It's written on your face, big and wide.
Stop doing that, Kairi. People like you, even if you don't fulfill
everyone's expectations. You're doing your best. That is enough.”</P><P>“But—”</P><P>“No
buts!” Naminè had gotten loud. “Don't always think so hard. Just
do what your heart tells you to.”</P><P>Kairi
looked into the eyes of a very serious Naminè. Was that really the
right thing to do? Just listen to her heart, to hear emotions?</P><P>“I...”</P><p 
align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Tifa
got hit on the back of her head with a coiled up magazine.</P><P>“Ouch,
what was that for?”</P><P>The
next attack hit Olette.</P><P>“Why
me too?”</P><P>Aerith
was towering over the two of them. When she had come home, Tifa was
showing Olette several of her treasured CDs. Olette had totally
forgotten why she had come home in the first place.</P><P>Aerith
looked down at Tifa, who was sitting on the couch. “You. I don't
care if you listen to this infernal noise when I'm not around, but to
drag Olette into liking this stuff is just wrong.”</P><P>She
turned to Olette. “And you! I thought you were going to ask Tifa to
resume training. What happened to your decision?”</P><P>“I,
um, sort of got distracted. I did ask Tifa to train me! She just
didn't want to.”</P><P>Tifa
looked, shocked, over to Olette, like she had just sold her out to
the devil.</P><P>Aerith
was looking rather angry. Very angry. “Tifa, I thought we talked
about this. We decided to personally train them and not have Leon
assign people for that. We wanted to ensure they could protect Kairi
when we aren't around.”</P><P>“Give
me a break, Aerith.” Tifa rolled her eyes. “I didn't say I would
never train her again, I just didn't feel like it today. You're
overreacting. What is wrong with you, anyway? Did something happen?”</P><P>Aerith's
mood changed quickly, from angry to excited. Cid had told her some
news and Tifa would be even more excited than she was if she heard.
To find her and Olette fooling around with CDs instead of training
had just turned all the excitement into anger.</P><P>“You
won't guess what's finally done.” Aerith had a huge grin on her
face.</P><P>“Just
tell me. You know I hate your cryptic messages and riddles.”</P><P>“The
Seventh Heaven. Cid finished building it.”</P><P>“What,
really? Took him long enough!” Tifa jumped off the couch so
abruptly that Olette was startled.</P><P>“He
says he still needs to do details here and there, but it should be
less than a week until we can open.” Aerith grabbed Tifa by the
wrist, preventing her from running off.</P><P>“What
are you two on about?” Olette had gotten curious.</P><P>“Back
in our world, I owned a pub in the slums called Seventh Heaven. I
asked Cid to build a pub here since we don't have one. Nobody else
has any experience running one, so Aerith and I will do it.”</P><P>Olette
was astonished. “You two are full of surprises, aren't you?”</P><P>“If
you knew what else they've been doing back in their own world, you'd
be even more amazed.”</P><P>All
three of them turned around to look at the black-haired girl who
stood in the door.</P><P>“Yo.”</P><P>“You
know I don't like it when you tell people unnecessarily about our
past.” Tifa gave Yuffie an explicit glare.</P><P>“Just
sayin'. Don't get angry, Tifa. I heard the news about the pub. I can
help out if you want.”</P><P>“You'd
rob our customers.” Aerith showed an evil grin.</P><P>“Oh
come on. You know I don't steal from people.”</P><P>“Not
anymore,” Aerith added.</P><P>“Point
taken. You're still angry about what happened in Wutai, aren't you?”</P><P>“No,
I'm just teasing you. If you want to work in the pub, ask Tifa,”
Aerith said, and left for the kitchen, giving both Tifa and Olette a
this isn't over yet glare.</P><P>Tifa
looked at Yuffie and sighed. To refuse her wouldn't do any good. With
a wink, Tifa signalized her approval. “I wanted someone to do the
waitress job anyway, since I'll be behind the bar and Aerith will be
in the kitchen. No goofing around at work.”</P><P>Olette
felt a bit left out and decided to ask a question she had been
wondering ever since she arrived in Hollow Bastion.</P><P>“What
did you live on until now if you're only now picking up jobs?”</P><P>“Committee
money. Since Hollow Bastion is getting better, though, it would be
really impudent to keep relying on that money. I really like working
in a pub, too, so one comes to another,” Tifa explained.</P><P>Olette
assumed it had been something like that. Rebuilding a world took a
lot of effort, especially on the administration level, and they
didn't have time to work normally.</P><P>“Most
of Hollow Bastion doesn't need supervising from us anymore. Only a
few parts, and we can manage that outside of work.”</P><P>Tifa
stood up and looked down at Olette. It was time the girl learned to
train independently from her. “Once the pub is open, you will have
to train alone, or with Kairi and Naminè.”</P><P>With
that, Tifa walked away upstairs, and left Olette alone with Yuffie.</P><P>“Is
that really what you want? To get back into training?” Yuffie asked
Olette.</P><P>“Yeah.
I feel it's the right thing to do.”</P><P>Her
voice was completely free of doubt.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“I
never thought you would say that, Kairi.”</P><P>Naminè
was sitting on the roof, next to Kairi.</P><P>“I'm
sorry.”</P><P>“Don't
be. There is no reason for you to be.”</P><P>Naminè's
voice was sounding really odd.</P><P>Kairi
didn't want to say anything, and it felt rather awkward between them
now. The previous easy atmosphere was completely gone.</P><P>Why
did she say that? Where had it come from? Listening to her heart,
sure. But why did she have to speak it out loud? It was so
embarrassing.</P><P>“I...I'm...not...I'm
not...laughing.” Naminè tried to stop giggling but she just
couldn't control herself.</P><P>“God,
why did I even say that? I never even thought about it before, it
just...came out!”</P><P>“Kairi,
I'm sorry...but...it's just funny. You're a really nice girl, but you
always take everything so seriously. And then you come and tell me
your dream is to become a singer! That's just odd!” Naminè started
laughing again, but stopped shortly after, finally trying to suppress
the urge.</P><P>“I
don't know! I can't remember thinking I wanted to be a singer. My
voice isn't even suited for that sort of thing.”</P><P>“Oh,
now you're lying. Your voice is really nice. I can imagine you
singing, but it doesn't fit with your...character.”</P><P>“I
guess you want to be an artist?” Kairi tried to change the topic.</P><P>“Me?
I don't know...I don't remember anything before I came here. No
memories of my childhood, nothing. I like to draw, but if to be an
artist is really my dream...I don't know. I want to be close to you.
That's all that counts for me right now,” Naminè answered
truthfully.</P><P>Kairi
blushed and looked away. Even if they now understood each other
better than before, and it wasn't as awkward when Naminè told her
she liked her, it was still an odd feeling to have her so close and
yet keep her so far away. Was that being cruel?</P><P>“I'm
a horrible person.”</P><P>“Why
do you think so?” Naminè was confused at the sudden topic change.</P><P>“I'm
here, sitting right next to you, looking at the sun that's slowly
going down, so close to you. And yet, I'm keeping you so far away
from me. It must hurt, right? You must think it's cruel.”</P><P>“I
don't. I would, if I didn't understand you. But I just have this
feeling...I can't explain it...that tells me that you're not a bad
person. You're really nice, you just...need time. I think.”</P><P>Kairi
was amazed at that answer and sat there, looking at Naminè with wide
eyes. “Maybe I need a push. I did need one back when I was chosen
as Keyblader, so maybe I need another to get over myself.”</P><P>“What
do you mean?”</P><P>Her
heart was beating so fast, Kairi felt slightly dizzy. Should she do
it? Maybe it really was a push she needed, and Naminè was so cute
and nice. No matter what she said, Kairi felt like a bad person deep
inside. Taking a deep breath, Kairi turned around, looked straight
into Naminè's eyes, and leaned forward too quickly for the blonde
girl to respond.</P><P>Soft
lips met, and Naminè felt a familiar heat surging up inside her.
Laying one hand on Kairi's neck, Naminè responded to the kiss,
joining in, tasting the redhead's delicate lips, smelling her scent,
and enjoying herself to her fullest.</P><P>Kairi
felt weird, kissing a girl, kissing Naminè. But it wasn't the same
weird feeling she had back on the island when Naminè had kissed her.
No pictures of memories, no dark past came up, showing her long
forgotten pain. It was pleasant to feel the smooth texture of her
lips, to be this close to her. Her heart was still racing, but it was
different from before. Not anxiety. Not fear. It was excitement, and
Kairi didn't want to break the kiss until she finally had to stop to
breathe.</P><P>Both
didn't dare say a word, astonishedly looking at each other. Neither
of them had felt like that before. It was like finally seeing the
light of the sun after many years in darkness. After a long and cold
tunnel, entering a big flower field in full bloom.</P><P>Naminè
slowly turned away, touching her own lips with her fingers. It still
seemed unreal. Illogical. Mysterious. Kairi had kissed her,
completely out of her own free will. And nothing bad had happened. It
was a wonderful sensation, and Naminè was blushing deeply. For the
first time, she didn't dare to look directly at Kairi.</P><P>“Did...”
Kairi looked away. Thank God the deep red sun was concealing the
color of her face. She was speaking really softly, a completely
different voice from her usually serious and composed voice. It was
like she was finally herself, after so much time.</P><P>“Did...
ou like it?”</P><P>“Yeah.”
Naminè wanted to make a clever remark, to say something better. But
nothing came to mind. It was like she was unable to think.</P><P>“Did
you...like it?” Naminè now asked Kairi.</P><P>“Yeah.
A lot.”</P><P>“Can...I
kiss you again?” Naminè was having problems talking. She had never
felt this nervous before, but it wasn't unpleasant at all. It was
like a happy nervousness.</P><P>“Hm...”
Kairi only nodded.</P><P>The
sun was sending her last rays of light over the rooftops of Hollow
Bastion when the two girls' lips met again. In close unison,
caressing each other, understanding each other, they shared a moment
of such intimacy that they didn't even notice that someone was
standing not too far away from them, silently crying to herself.</P><p 
align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“You
look horrible. Did something happen with Kairi?” Yuffie was already
in bed. It was pitch-black outside.</P><P>“No.
Nothing at all.”</P><P>Olette's
voice was moody, and it was clear that she was angry. It was too dark
to see her face, but Yuffie was sure that Olette had been crying. She
just had a feeling for it.</P><P>“Really?
You sound like you've been cry—”</P><P>“It's
nothing, damn it!” Olette suddenly yelled, and turned around.</P><P>Yuffie
decided not to ask more. She knew when to stop asking. Getting up and
staying behind Olette, she hesitated a moment. Was this the right
decision? She knew how it would eventually end. She knew what she
gotten herself involved in.</P><P>Looking
at the broken girl in front of her, alone and sad, and with a mental
sigh, she ignored her worries. Embracing Olette from behind, Yuffie
could now feel that she was shaking and crying. Not saying a word,
both of them stood there in the darkness, until Olette had finally
calmed down.</P><P>Taking
her hand, Yuffie pulled Olette into bed, ignoring that she was still
wearing all her clothes, that her hair was a mess, that her shirt was
wet from tears. She knew exactly how despair felt, how it felt to be
all alone in the darkness. And she didn't wish for anyone else to
experience that.</P><P>Soon,
Olette had fallen asleep and Yuffie still hugged her, not letting her
go.</P><P>“I'm
not going to let you go.”</P><P>And
with those final words, the ninja also fell asleep.</P><P>The
next day came, and when Yuffie woke up, Olette was gone. She heard
sounds from the kitchen. Had she gotten up to make breakfast? But
Olette had seemed really hurt, and it hurt Yuffie to just look at
her. There was definitely something wrong with her.</P><P>“What're
you doing?” Yuffie walked half-dressed in the living room that
included the kitchen.</P><P>“Breakfast.
Want some?” With a big smile, Olette looked at Yuffie.</P><P>Olette
was so cheerful it was disgusting. It was false cheerfulness, and
Yuffie knew it the moment she looked at her.</P><P>“No...no
thanks.” Yuffie couldn't bear it.</P><P>It
made Yuffie sick to see this. That wide false smile. That fake
cheerfulness.</P><P>“No?
But it's really good. Here, have some.” Olette placed a plate on
the table and looked with her false cheerfulness at Yuffie.</P><P>Unable
to take it anymore, Yuffie walked up to Olette, and before her
expression could change to confused, Yuffie forced the brunette into
a chair.</P><P>“Stop
this right now! I know you feel nothing like this! Stop running away
from your problems!” Yuffie yelled at her furiously.</P><P>“What
do you know how I feel!” Olette stood back up and pushed Yuffie
back.</P><P>“I
don't, so tell me!”</P><P>Those
words had the desired impact. Olette stumbled back and looked at the
ground. It was wrong to let it out on Yuffie, who had been caring for
her these past three days.</P><P>“I
like you...I want to be with you...but I can't if you run away from
your problems,” Yuffie said, getting closer to Olette.</P><P>“I...it
just hurts so much...”</P><P>“It
always hurts. I don't want to see you like this, Olette. If you feel
like crying, I'm here for you. You don't have to put up an act.”</P><P>Olette
only nodded. She didn't feel like crying anymore, and dropping her
cheerful act felt so much better. But how would she deal with it?</P><P>“I'm
here for you. I will stay by your side as long as you need me.”</P><P>Yuffie
stood in front Olette for a moment before the brunette took her hand.
It felt a bit rough, but Yuffie didn't want to take her hand away.</P><P>“Can
you do me a favor?” Olette was looking really down.</P><P>Yuffie
nodded.</P><P>“I
want you to kiss me.”</P><P>Yuffie
could feel her heart jump a little, but it was only for a short
moment. She had wanted to kiss Olette ever since the first night they
had spent together. She had a cute face, and it had always been a
shame that she hadn't gotten to kiss her.</P><P>Yuffie
was surprisingly pretty embarrassed about it and closed her eyes
before she moved in to Olette's face.</P><P>More
nervous than she had anticipated she would be, Olette closed her eyes
too. Seconds later, she felt Yuffie's lips on her own. It was a nice
feeling, even though she felt miserable. Like a little fire inside
her that was burning her pain and bad thoughts away. It helped to
forget what she saw, what she heard.</P><P>Yuffie
enjoyed it, but not quite as much as she thought she would. It must
have been because Olette was hurt. The kiss left a little bit of
empty feeling inside, as if she hadn't earned it.</P><P>Olette
broke the kiss, and looked over at the clock. It was time to leave.
She didn't want to see Tifa, to go out, but she wanted to stop acting
like a little child.</P><P>“My
training...”</P><P>“I
know. I'll wait for you. See you later.”</P><P>Yuffie
wasn't smiling, but she didn't seem sad either. Olette could feel how
much Yuffie cared for her, how much she meant to her. It hurt to
leave her behind now, it hurt to leave her place. Already out the
door, Olette heard her name being called.</P><P>“Olette.”</P><P>Turning
around once again, Yuffie had closed in so fast that she almost
stumbled over her own chaos on the ground, kissing Olette for a
second again.</P><P>“I'm
here for you.” Yuffie smiled at her, her eyes sparkling.</P><P>Olette
felt a bit better through those words. Nodding, she finally left,
leaving Yuffie behind.</P><P>Yuffie
wandered into the kitchen and looked inside the fridge, only to close
it a split second later. Scratching her cheek with a sigh, she looked
inside her wallet.</P><P>“I
knew I was pushing it with feeding two people. Gotta ask Olette
later...wait a second.”</P><P>With
a diabolical smirk, Yuffie looked towards the door.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Kairi
and Naminè had spent some more time on the roof, kissing two more
times, before they went to bed. Both had a hard time sleeping,
thinking about what happened. Kairi felt different from before. She
had only thought of it that moment, but she had been right.</P><P>All
she had needed was her own decision to move on. To give herself
another push. To jump over her shadow. And it had worked.</P><P>Kairi
could see Naminè now in a different light, and it was weird how
easily she got embarrassed just thinking about now. Had she fallen in
love with Naminè?</P><P>Late
at night, Kairi noticed something different. If she was able to see
Naminè like this...what about Olette? Wasn't it horrible of her to
completely ignore her in this? Olette had confessed to her too...</P><P>“Back
to being a horrible person...” Kairi whispered to herself.</P><P>But
what could she do? Kairi had no idea if Olette even wanted to be with
her anymore. Going and kissing her would probably do more harm than
good. Telling her what happened would probably just hurt her.</P><P>And
what about Naminè? One of them would end up hurt anyway. It was only
logical to pick Naminè after what happened between them.</P><P>“Logical,
huh...” Logic was what made her like this, cold and oblivious to
other people's feelings. She had finally changed. For the better?
Kairi didn't know, but it felt better than before.</P><P>“Think
outside of logical...” Kairi told herself. “Why does this have to
be so complicated? Whatever I do now, someone is gonna be hurt...it
isn't fair.”</P><P>Restless,
Kairi turned over once again. How had she managed to push herself
this far anyway? Was she just fed up with being an emotional ice
block? Or did she, deep down, long to respond to the affection Naminè
was showing? Maybe it was both. Taking Naminè's advice, she had done
it on impulse, without thinking about the consequences. It had
worked, to some extent. She felt different now, like a completely new
person. But it had also spawned new problems.</P><P>New
problems...</P><P>With
that one thought in mind, Kairi finally fell asleep.</P><P>The
next morning wasn't her best. With only very few hours of sleep,
Kairi's hair was all wild and uncombed, standing in thousand
directions. Her eyes were only half-open. She had never felt like
this before. Getting only a little sleep on a mission was one thing,
since she often used to rely on adrenaline to wake her up, but she
was at home right now.</P><P>“Did
you get hit by one of Cid's machines?” Tifa was curious as to what
had caused Kairi to look like that.</P><P>“So...sleepy...”
Kairi laid her head on the table, cursing her always busy mind.</P><P>“And
here comes yet another one that looks like she got under a truck.”</P><P>Kairi
turned around and saw Naminè, the hair no less wild and no less
sleepy than Kairi, as she walked down the stairs.</P><P>“What
the hell did you two do that...oh...oh... I see.” Tifa was grinning
so widely that Kairi could virtually feel it.</P><P>She
couldn't help but blush and point at Tifa. “Keep me out of your
perverted mind!”</P><P>“Looking
at you two, it's not me who's perverted,” Tifa continued to tease.</P><P>“Stop
it, Tifa. Or should I show them how you look when we get up?”
Aerith said, who was standing behind Tifa and holding a plate with
breakfast.</P><P>“I'll
behave.” Tifa was quiet all of a sudden.</P><P>“Good
girl.”</P><P>Kairi
and Naminè somehow finished their breakfast and just wanted to get
back to bed, but they weren't allowed to. Kairi was freed from
training by Leon, but Naminè wasn't.</P><P>“Kairi,
uh...do you want to come and watch my training?” Naminè asked.</P><P>Tifa
was immediately about to make a snippy remark, but she caught
Aerith's glare and decided against saying anything. Instead, she
sulked in her chair. Sometimes Aerith could be a real party pooper.</P><P>Kairi
wasn't sure how to react. After yesterday evening, she wasn't sure
what to do with Naminè. They had kissed a few times. Did that mean
they were going out? Did Naminè think that? But...</P><P>“Yeah,
I'll come by.”</P><P>“Good.
Then I can check your skills. I guess you've gotten rusty since our
last session,” Aerith threw in.</P><P>With
a loud bang, Kairi let her head fall onto the table, sighing loud
enough to make it comical.</P><P>“Talk
about misfortune,” Kairi said, causing Naminè to giggle.</P><P>“It's
not so bad, Kairi. At least you're not alone.”</P><P>Kairi
lifted her head and met Naminè's gaze for a second. They both got
slightly embarassed and looked away. Tifa smiled to herself. She was
smelling that there was something going on between the two girls.</P><P>“I
guess even Keybladers have their own 'problems', don't they?” Tifa
said. She finished the last piece of her breakfast and left with a
hasty “See you later!” before Aerith could punish her.</P><P>“Jeez,
that Tifa. Don't let it bother you, Kairi. I'm sure she is happy for
you too.”</P><P>Happy?
For what? Did something happen? What were they think—</P><P>“It's
not like that!” Kairi deeply blushed and waved with her hands.</P><P>“Oh,
it isn't? That's too baaaad.” Aerith was smiling widely and Kairi
just knew she wasn't taking her seriously.</P><P>“It
really isn't like that! We just ki—” Kairi closed her mouth
before she could finish that line.</P><P>“You
'ki'?” Aerith looked at the two girls, who were really embarrassed
about it.</P><P>“Nothing
at all! I'm going to Yuffie's!” Kairi left her dish on the table
and left before Aerith could ask anymore embarassing questions.
Naminè was left alone, completely at Aerith's mercy.</P><P>“So,
what did you two do?” Aerith asked with a knowing smile. “Did you
kiss? Or...”</P><P>Naminè
could only guess at what Aerith was implying, but she nodded. “Yeah.
We kissed. It's...just that. We kissed. Don't tell Kairi I told you!
But I'm not feeling too good about it.”</P><P>“How
come? I thought you liked Kairi a lot.” Aerith was confused. What
did Naminè mean?</P><P>“Yeah
I do. I love her. But...I think it would be really mean for me to
snatch Kairi away like this when Olette isn't around. I like her a
lot and...”</P><P>Naminè
sighed. It had kept her awake for most of the night. Back in the
pirate world she had wanted to be together with Kairi, but only if
Olette was with them too. Was that a lie? If she searched her
feelings, she found that she really did want to be with Kairi...but
it was like it was wrong as long as Olette was away.</P><P>“Hm...and
I guess Olette likes Kairi too?” Aerith had already figured as
much, but hearing this from Naminè was pretty much a confirmation of
what she suspected was going on.</P><P>Naminè
looked a bit panicked, but Aerith smiled as usual. She wouldn't
gossip about this. Maybe it would help to tell her about all what
happened...</P><P>Starting
from the point where they had thought Kairi had died, Naminè told
Aerith the whole story, up until the point where she and Kairi
kissed. It felt so good to finally talk to someone about it that she
completely lost track of time.</P><P>“So,
you want to be with Kairi, but you don't want Olette to drift away
from you two. The question is, does Kairi, does Olette want that?”
Aerith had mixed feelings about what to tell Naminè.</P><P>“Kairi
doesn't want Olette to leave either. She is really bothered by what
happened. I don't think she wanted things go to this way. I...don't
know about Olette right now.”</P><P>“I
think you should talk to Olette and tell her honestly what happened.
If Olette is really your friend, then you shouldn't have secrets from
her.” Aerith looked at the clock. It was already past twelve. What
had Kairi been doing for so long?</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Kairi
couldn't believe what she saw. Running over to Yuffie's place, she
had seen Olette standing in the door from a distance. What amazed her
was that suddenly Yuffie jumped Olette, kissing her. It was a shock
for Kairi. Had Olette gotten over her this fast?</P><P>“I
can't believe this...”</P><P>Kairi
had walked away without talking to Olette. She felt a pain in her
heart but couldn't explain it. She had only seen Olette as a friend
all this time. Why had it hurt to see her kiss Yuffie? If she was
happy with it, shouldn't she, as Olette's friend, be happy for her?</P><P>It
didn't seem to be that easy. Nothing seemed to be easy for her.</P><P>“Why
the hell does everything have to be this complicated?!” Kairi
yelled, and kicked a stone.</P><P>Frustrated
with herself and how everything around here had changed, she wanted
to escape from all it for a few hours. So she went down to the
canyon, as just screaming out loud and letting it all out was the
best way to get rid of built-up stress.</P><P>“I
can't believe her! Being all emotional and not coming home and then
getting together with Yuffie—with Yuffie, of all people! Just like
that!” Kairi shouted. She summoned Oathkeeper and went berserk on a
few rocks.</P><P>Breathing
heavily a good ten minutes later, Kairi was finally exhausted enough
to calm down and think about it rationally and logically.</P><P>“I
shouldn't assume things. I should just go and talk to Olette...I hope
she will talk to me at all. But...what should I say? 'Hi, I saw you
and Yuffie kissing, are you dating?' Yeah, sure. That's rude, at
best.”</P><P>Should
she just go and say whatever came to mind? Maybe she was overthinking
things again and that had led to this situation in the first place.
Kairi didn't want to make it any worse than it was.</P><P>A
good fifteen minutes later, a still-winded Kairi with a summoned
Keyblade and wild umcombed hair showed up at Olette's training place.</P><P>“What
the hell happened to you? Are we under attack?” Tifa asked, and
stopped so suddenly that she got a frontal hit from Olette, knocking
her over.</P><P>“Damn,
that hurt!” Tifa moaned, and rubbed her chin.</P><P>“Olette,
I...need to...talk...you...” Kairi got out in between heavy pants.</P><P>Olette
didn't respond and avoided looking at Kairi. After yesterday, she
didn't even want to see her, much less talk to her. Kairi had
betrayed her.</P><P>“Look,
it's really important.” Kairi had calmed down and stared at Olette.
Tifa was standing by and looking confused.</P><P>“Can
you leave? You're interrupting my training.” Olette was really cold
towards Kairi.</P><P>“Okay,
you don't want to talk to me, that's fine. I'll do the talking,
then.”</P><P>Olette
looked away and pretended to ignore her. What was it that Kairi
wanted to say? Brag that she was together with Naminè now? That she
didn't want to be with her? That she had chosen Naminè over her?</P><P>“Yesterday,
I kissed Naminè. And...I think I started to see her as something
different than a friend.”</P><P>Olette
knew. She knew all about it. She had overheard all of it. Why the
hell did she have to listen to this crap? Getting angry, Olette
clenched her fist. If Kairi didn't finish soon...</P><P>“But...I
don't think I can be with Naminè without feeling guilty about
this...not giving you a chance. I don't want you to be left all
alone. I like you too, and—” Kairi didn't get to finish.</P><P>“Who
says I'm alone! I have Yuffie and you know what, I'm tired of your
ever-changing mood. One day you reject us, the next you're up the
roof happily fooling around with Naminè. Who the hell do you think
you are that you can screw with my feelings like this?!” Olette
yelled at Kairi, furious.</P><P>“I
never said anything about the roof...did you watch us?” Kairi was
confused and felt a little violated inside.</P><P>“I
overheard you. I was coming up there because I wanted to be friends
with you again. But you know what, screw that.” Olette couldn't
stop herself. She was crying inside, asking for someone to stop her,
to stop her from making it all worse.</P><P>“Then
why are you so angry? I never said anything to Naminè about being
together with her. I thought the whole night about what a horrible
person I am that I did this without you around!” Kairi felt like
she was being accused of a crime she hadn't committed.</P><P>“You
are a horrible person! If you're that concerned about me, why didn't
you stop? Why did you kiss her again? Why did you two look all
happy?”</P><P>“Wouldn't
you have looked happy too in that situation?!” Kairi was now
yelling back, having reached her limit. She knew she wasn't
completely in the right, but Olette was going overboard.</P><P>“But
I am not in this situation! You are! And that's the point, it's
always about you!” Olette was about to rush and hit Kairi, but Tifa
stood between them.</P><P>“Both
of you, shut up!”</P><P>Tifa
could be really loud if she wanted to, and it had the desired effect.
Both girls, surprised and intimidated by the sudden outburst, went
quiet.</P><P>“From
what I hear, you're both at fault here. Don't go and blame everything
on each other. Kairi, leave now. I won't repeat myself.” Tifa was
scary when she was this serious, and Kairi didn't dare to object.</P><P>“Olette,
training is over for today. I want you to think about what you just
said. About what you accused Kairi of.”</P><P>Kairi
looked at the ground and left in one direction, Olette in the other.</P><P>Who
does she think she is? It's obviously she who is wrong!</P><P>Both
of them shared that thought. And both felt that they had just broken
something that could never be repaired. It hurt, both of them, but
they didn't want to show it. It was a horrible feeling.</P><P>Back
at home, Kairi lay on the couch, hating herself and Olette. She had
done the wrong thing, but Olette was the one overreacting. She and
Naminè weren't dating. They only kissed a few times. She was finally
able to deal properly with her feelings, and now? Olette seemed to
hate her.</P><P>“What's
wrong?” Naminè was looking down on her.</P><P>“I
had a fight with Olette. She saw us, overheard us last evening. She's
really furious about it,” Kairi said and turned around.</P><P>“I
know. I met her on my way home. She was waiting for me, wanted to
talk to me.”</P><P>“What
did she say?” Kairi was really curious now.</P><P>“She
wanted to know what was happening to us three, why we are drifting
apart.”</P><P>Kairi
grit her teeth. She knew exactly what was happening to them. And it
was mostly her fault too.</P><P>“I
explained to her what happened between us. She wanted me to smack her
for being a idiot.” Naminè seemed so much different than usual.</P><P>“You
smacked her?”</P><P>“Kairi,
Olette is still my friend...I don't want you two to fight.”</P><P>With
that, Naminè left for upstairs. Looking back one last time, the
blonde girl said something else.</P><P>“I
love you.”</P><P>Kairi
was left alone in the living room. Dropping back on the couch, Kairi
stared at the celling.</P><P>“Why
does my life have to be such a mess...”</P><P>And
with a slight melancholic expression, Kairi closed her eyes.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“What
happened to your cheek?” Yuffie was shocked that Olette came home
with a glaring red hand mark on her right cheek.</P><P>“It's
nothing.”</P><P>“Did
someone hit you? Are you okay? Was it Kairi?” Yuffie stopped one
step short.</P><P>“I
said it's nothing!” Olette burst out, and knocked over the table
with a kick.</P><P>Yuffie
didn't dare get close to Olette. She seemed really furious, even
beyond yesterday. What in the world had happened today?</P><P>“I'm
going to bed. Good night, Yuffie...” Olette said, sounding very
exhausted.</P><P>“It's
not even dark out...okay. I'll join you later,” Yuffie replied,
knowing it would be best to leave Olette alone for now.</P><P>Crawling
into bed, Olette felt horrible. Her cheek still hurt. Naminè had
explained everything to her, but what had it changed? She was now
with Yuffie and she didn't want to leave her. She liked Yuffie. But
how did Yuffie feel about her? Did she like her? Love her? What was
she in for?</P><P>Thinking
about it, Olette slowly fell asleep. She didn't notice when Yuffie
went to bed, laying right next to her. Yuffie leaned over and smiled
at Olette's sleeping face. The past two days had been pretty
dramatic, but she had also gotten a whole lot closer to Olette.</P><P>Kissing
Olette on the cheek, Yuffie laid down next to her and grabbed her
hand, smiling happily.</P>
