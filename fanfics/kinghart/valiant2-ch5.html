Destiny</I></P><P>“Demyx,”
Xigbar called out to him to get his attention. “You keep watch and
tell me when Axel is coming.”</P><P>“Yeah,
yeah…did they ever pick the wrong guy for this,” he complained
and summoned his weapon, a blue guitar.</P><P>Even
Saïx didn't know what exactly Demyx’s abilities were, but he would
get to see them. His water marionettes had brought them the
information that the rats from Hollow Bastion were also here. They
were the ones that did them the favor of disposing of Marluxia and
his traitorous breed. However, there were only three of them, and
Xigbar had an ambush planned.</P><P>“Wow,
hey, my marionettes picked up some weird resonance. Whoa, wait, even
two. They resemble the wavelength of that Keyblader girl. And somehow
Axel's managed to lure them all into our trap,” Demyx reported, and
kept his marionette spell up.</P><P>It was
his special ability to create water marionettes of himself to go and
gather information. They could even be used for fighting purposes. It
was the only kind of ability in the Organization that could be used
for spying purposes; while Saïx and Xigbar had theirs concentrated
on combat.</P><P>“We
have five incoming signals. The Keyblader, one that resembles that
signal farther behind, and two others, one with an awfully powerful
magic ability, the other is kind of fuzzy. The lead of them is Axel,”
he called over to Xigbar.</P><P>The man
with the eye-patch had a disastrous grin on his face. This would be
Axel's end, and by chance, they could even take the Keyblader
captive. Xemnas would be very pleased.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“Shit,
I have to get away from them somehow. But the darkness corridors are
downright flooded with Nobodies that are waiting for me. And I left
Naminè all alone, damn.” Axel swore and took another jump over a
wall.</P><P>The ninja
girl was following him close up, ready to throw her oversized
shuriken at him at any time. If that thing hit him without any
defense, it would hurt like hell. Not to mention that the other ones
already had caught up. They were barely fifty feet behind him and
were slowly closing the distance.</P><P>“Dammit.
Maybe I'll lose them in the forest that’s between the mansion and
the town.” Axel swore again.</P><P>This was
not looking good.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“Yuffie!
Where is he running?” Kairi shouted to the ninja who was jumping
from roof to roof, having the Organization member continuously in her
watch.</P><P>“There
is this big ass wall at the end of this alley. There is like some
crack on it. He must have his hideout or something behind there. I
have no idea what’s behind the wall!” Yuffie shouted back, not
turning her eyes away from the man in the black robe.</P><P>It was
only a matter of seconds until she had to jump down, because the
alley was about to end in a big plaza. Aiming as well as she could,
she threw her shuriken after Axel, nearly hitting him.</P><P>“Kairi,
pick that up for me, okay?!” she shouted, and took a detour about
another roof to get down.</P><P>“What
am I, her personal delivery service?” Kairi complained, but
nevertheless picked up the ninja’s weapon.</P><P>“You
know how Yuffie is, Kairi. She would do the same for you,” Aerith
assured the Keyblader.</P><P>“I
know. We have to catch up with him. I don't want to lose his trail,”
Kairi said, and gave Aerith a nod and stopped.</P><P>“This
will only take a second, dear,” Aerith said, and cast a spell.</P><P>“<I>Time
which flows, let us walk beyond your chains,</I>” she recited.</P><P>The spell
took effect immediately and they both continued the pursuit of the
Organization XIII member with at least twice the speed. Sadly, this
spell only lasted for about twenty seconds.</P><P>They had
almost caught up when Axel vanished through the crack in the wall and
Yuffie had joined up.</P><P>“Here,
your shuriken.” Kairi then threw it to Yuffie while running.</P><P>“Thanks
a lot. Now let's catch him. Leon will pick on me for ages if we let
him get away,” Yuffie replied.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“Where
did she go?”</P><P>Olette
was looking around. The man in the black robe had appeared and was
being chased by the very same girl from the glass tower ornament, the
town itself was frozen, and on top of all this, now she had lost the
trail of where those people were running to.</P><P>But there
was only one place likely to be of interest for those weird people.
The girl would surely know what was going on with her. The Struggle
tournament couldn't go on anyway with everything frozen, so she
continued her pursuit of the girl.</P><P>“What's
up with this today?” she asked and took the pendant in her hand.</P><P>It was
warm and a feeling of power ran through her. And Olette knew that she
had to keep going, for whatever reason. She had to know who those
people were, had to know what those recent events were all about.</P><P>She would
have had been better off not knowing.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“Four
of the five are about to enter! The last one is somewhere in the
town, but keeps emitting that weird signal. Ten seconds until they
arrive, Xigbar.” Demyx made his report.</P><P>“Good.
Demyx, your job is over. Take cover. I'm going to blow this whole
forest to bits.” Xigbar laughed and initiated his supreme attack.</P><P>Just
seconds later, Axel jumped through the crack, saw Xigbar floating in
the air at once, and noticed Demyx and someone else further back.</P><P>“Shit!”</P><P>Axel
stood there for a moment like he was frozen—that
is, until Kairi, Aerith and Yuffie came after him, cutting him off
from the town.</P><P>Xigbar's
plan was a success. They all were in position. The Keyblader wouldn't
die so fast, but he had to blast them off anyway.</P><P>“Aerith,
cast a barrier, this is a trap!” Yuffie shouted, seconds before the
attack of the man with eye-patch rained down on the place where they
all were standing.</P><P>“<I>Crimson
Needle Rain</I><I>!</I>” Xigbar shouted, and shot off countless
energy-charged needles into the air, which came down like an arrow
shower on the group from Hollow Bastion.</P><P>The
impact was enormous and bathed the whole forest in a violet light.
The place where the group of people had been standing was wrapped in
dense smoke from the ground that had been destroyed.</P><P>Axel was
fatally hit and fell down without even screaming out. Either he was
instantaneously dead, or was playing dead.</P><P>When the
smoke slowly vanished, Xigbar could see that he had only achieved one
of his goals. The brown-haired woman had cast a protection spell just
before he had launched his attack. However, it looked like there was
quite some damage, though.</P><P>“Aerith,
you okay?” Kairi asked her lifesaver.</P><P>The woman
just nodded, unable to speak right now. It was amazing that she had
managed to form that barrier around them that fast. But she herself
had taken a lot of damage. This kind of barrier didn't just block the
entire attack, it decreased the damage by a lot and the caster had to
take all the remains of the attack.</P><P>“You
are from the Organization too!” Yuffie yelled angrily at Xigbar and
jumped right out of the barrier to get back at the man.</P><P>“So?
You got a problem with that, little girl?” he laughed at her and
rose higher and higher, over the trees with Yuffie blindly following
him.</P><P>“Saïx!
Demyx! Kill the girl! She's got to be in the mansion! Find her, kill
her, now! I'm going to clean this mess up!” he yelled from far
above them.</P><P>Saïx
immediately vanished in direction of the mansion, but Demyx hesitated
for a moment.</P><P>Kairi
knew that someone the Organization XIII
wanted dead had a good chance of being an ally to her.</P><P>“Aerith,
can you fight?” she asked the woman.</P><P>“Yes,
I'm fine; I just won't be able to cast any major spells like Nova or
Ultima for a while,” Aerith replied and gave her a nod.</P><P>With
that, Kairi rushed past Demyx, who was slightly confused. Didn't
Xigbar say that he would keep those brats busy? He was about to go
after Kairi and shot off a few water pulses when a few feet away an
impressive fireball hit a tree and caused a likewise impressive
explosion.</P><P>“You
will not go anywhere. I'm your opponent!” Aerith called over to
where Demyx was standing.</P><P>“Did
they ever pick the wrong guy for these missions. Why does it always
have to be me? And why do I get the worst opponent every time? Jeez…I
can't believe this.” He then pointed at Aerith, summoning his
instrument back. “Time to die.”</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Olette
had finally reached the plaza. The town was still frozen, but that
way she could make it still to the Struggle finals. At least that was
one positive effect these weird happenings had.</P><P>From
beyond the wall, Olette could hear explosions, and when she looked
through, a blond man and a brunette woman where fighting each other,
shooting off things like it was the natural thing to do.</P><P>It was
like in some fantasy stories, people using magic and all weird kinds
of stuff to settle things. But this was real, not inside a book, not
inside a dream. She could feel the heat that some of the trees were
emitting. They must have been on fire.</P><P>There was
no sign of the man she had seen at all. He must been further in. Most
likely inside the mansion, but who were these people?</P><P>Tightening
her grip on the glowing pendant, she entered the forest area, trying
to pass by unnoticed.</P><P>These
people were not likely to be very friendly.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>On top of
the trees, Xigbar was quite busy with just Yuffie. She was far too
fast to get hit by his needles, no matter how hard he tried. On the
other hand, she didn't have any time to launch an attack of her own.</P><P>Yuffie
jumped from one tree to another, vanishing into the foliage of the
tree, out of Xigbar's view. This was not good. There was about any
direction she could attack
from next.</P><P>Ferociously
looking around, turning around every few seconds, he heard something
right behind him. With a fast turn around, he shot off an entire load
of needles in that direction just to see that he had fallen for a
trap. He had pierced nothing. Just something in the trees had made a
sound.</P><P>“Shit,
where is she?!” he swore and suddenly felt something on his back.</P><P>“Right
behind you, dumbass!” Yuffie shouted in his ear and jumped off,
leaving four little orbs on his robe.</P><P>Before he
could react to this, the orbs exploded, leaving him in a cloud of
smoke.</P><P>That, by
far, wasn't enough to seriously beat him. He coughed at the smoke and
looked around the girl had vanished again. He wouldn't tolerate this
hide and seek game forever. Randomly shooting needles at the trees
all around him, he eventually forced Yuffie to move.</P><P>Yuffie
was agile and smart when it came to fighting and tactics, but someone
that could shoot off any amount of needles at any time was quite the
horror for her. She just had landed a hit with mithros, small bombs
from which she had still around forty left, but it didn't seem to
have inflicted any damage. And now he was shooting blindly around</P><P>Discarding
this plan of surprise attack, she switched to a plan of getting him
into close combat. He wouldn't be able to hit her directly with those
needles at a short range. Leaving four of the small bombs on the
tree, she left, and he noticed her but was too slow to hit her. She
was even faster than Tifa, but not even remotely as strong. Her
strengths lay in tactics and surprise attacks, but those wouldn't
work here.</P><P>“I
really should have switched with Tifa. This guy is a pain in the
ass,” Yuffie complained and continued to jump from one tree to
another.</P><P>Just
then, the battle of Aerith and Demyx changed the whole situation. A
few trees were burning and another few had fallen. She wasn't able to
float like Xigbar and it got much harder to move with every tree that
fell.</P><P>Now the
situation was to her disadvantage. Yuffie had to think of something
and it had to be fast. It didn't take too long. Any moment
now, the bombs on the tree would explode, hopefully distracting her
enemy long enough to get in close range.</P><P>Xigbar
was just about to fire off an entire load of needles when the bombs
that Yuffie had set exploded. Thinking that he had been chasing an
illusion, he looked at where the explosion came from. But there was
nothing, only the burning top of a tree. He had fallen right into her
trap; he of all people fell for such a simple trick.</P><P>Yuffie
could see from where she was standing that the bombs had set the tree
on fire, and set everything on this chance. She wasn't able to do
much like Aerith, but she was still able to use magic. Charging her
shuriken with a magnet spell, she threw it right after Xigbar when he
was about to look back.</P><P>He
immediately shot off needles, but they all got drawn to the
approaching shuriken weapon. Just before it hit, the ninja grabbed
her weapon and made direct contact with Xigbar, kicking him right in
the face.</P><P>Yuffie
jumped after her shuriken and used it to block off all of Xigbar's
needles. Now, she hung on him, out of the reach of this weapons, but
floating sixty feet above the ground. A fall from that altitude and
she would not get off lightly.</P><P>Xigbar
was struggling to get Yuffie off, but she had managed to get on his
back and was holding him firmly. There was no way to reach her in
that position. But he could float; she had to keep clinging on him to
not crash into the ground. A malicious plan formed in his head and he
started to rise higher and higher, ninety feet, a hundred-twenty
feet, a hundred-fifty feet, two-hundred feet and further up.</P><P>“Do you
plan to take a vacation in the sky?” Yuffie asked and continued to
hold him, restricting his actions.</P><P>She
had his arms in such a way so that he wasn't able to shoot anywhere
but the ground. If he tried to break away, he would most likely break
every single bone in his arms. Not even with his superior strength
was he able to give counter to this position. But he didn't need to.</P><P>He just
kept silent and when they had reached an almost six-hundred-foot
altitude, he suddenly went wild and almost managed to throw off
Yuffie, just to shoot off a couple dozen needles straight into the
sky.</P><P>“I'm
right behind you, not above you, idiot.” Yuffie grinned and now
knew how she would get away from this.</P><P>A free
fall would be certain death, but Yuffie had a trick up her sleeve.
While Aerith was master of magic and Tifa was downright a monster of
physical strength, Yuffie's talents were centered around manipulating
things and item-based strategy.</P><P>But
before she could do anything, Xigbar suddenly started to descend
almost in a free fall. The air drag put them both in a horizontal
position, and it now became apparent what Xigbar had planned. The
needles he had sent flying straight in the sky were about to hit
them. They were at a five-hundred-foot altitude when Yuffie jumped
off and prepared for a battle in free fall.</P><P>These
wasn't necessarily the best conditions, but Xigbar had to descend
with her if he wanted to land a clean hit. The air roaring around
her, Yuffie took her shuriken and threw it right at Xigbar who got
hit on his left arm, and the shuriken flew away.</P><P>“Ha,
throwing away your only weapon? Aren’t we a little desperate,
little girl? Afraid of death, are we?” laughed Xigbar.</P><P>Yuffie
did a somersault in midair and expanded her air resistance with a
little trick. While doing the somersault, she threw off a dozen of
the bombs she had used before. She had once used this when they had
still lived in their own world and was skydiving with Cid's airship,
the Highwind.</P><P>Focusing
her mind on her weapon, she stretched her arm in the direction it was
and did barely noticeable movements with her fingers. Xigbar was
about to shoot at her when he heard a roaring sound and the shuriken
he had just seen fly away was coming back.</P><P>Yuffie
had changed her fighting style after seeing Kairi fight against a
flying Heartless while she was bound to ground.</P><P>“<I>Bloodfest
manipulate version!</I>” Yuffie shouted, and the shuriken was
roaring and hitting Xigbar like an out of control beast.</P><P>His robe
was cut on countless spots and he had taken quite some damage. But
that was not all Yuffie had planned. The shuriken returned to her
just to serve as a skydiving tool. Another three seconds later, the
bombs above her gave away an explosion, and the shockwave sent Yuffie
on her weapon flying on the wind.</P><P>While
this was initially supposed to be a technique for fun, it now
happened to be quite useful.</P><P>Xigbar
was roaring in rage and started shooting like a berserker after
Yuffie. She got hit quite a bit but that was intended. It was the
only way to build up the necessary amount of energy. But now she had
to get more distance between her and Xigbar, who couldn't descend as
fast as she could with the push from the explosion shockwave.</P><P>She
gradually left his range of attack and he screamed in wrath. That
girl would not get away! Not from him!</P><P>He
started charging for another supreme attack and put even more energy
in it than before. He wasn't paying any attention to his condition
anymore. His only intent was to kill Yuffie. Above him accumulated a
lot of needles, a proper ocean of them. If those hit a defenseless
Yuffie while she was descending, it would be fatal.</P><P>The ninja
could see what he was doing. She had anticipated that he would at one
point try to hit her with that, but this was rather unfortunate.
Still at a three-hundred-foot altitude, she started to charge her own
attack. Yuffie hadn't taken all his hits for nothing. If this failed,
the only resolve left was to hope for help from Aerith—but
the forest below her was already an ocean of flames.</P><P>Xigbar
had finished charging. He would pierce that girl to death, and it
would mean to be on the edge of nothingness when he finished the
attack. Xigbar yelled out, ordering the needles to descend at an
absurd speed.</P><P>“<I>Crimson
Needle Rain!</I>” he yelled, and this time it was much much
stronger than before. Not even Aerith would have blocked this with a
simple barrier.</P><P>The
ridiculous amount of needles was coming closer. Yuffie couldn't
finish charging the energy till it reached its peak and would have to
leave it off if she wanted to avoid a direct hit.</P><P>Throwing
the shuriken above her, using it as the middle point to accumulate
the energy, she let off her last resolve for this fight.</P><P>“<I>All
Creation!</I>” Yuffie shouted, and let off a massive energy beam in
direction of the needle rain. This would never suffice to block them
all off, but the chances were high that she could get away alive.</P><P>The beam
roared through the needles, blasting the whole center of it away, and
vanished in conclusion. The rest were barely more than what Xigbar
had used for three or four of his attacks, but they still hit Yuffie
and she took direct damage.</P><P>This was
it, she couldn't go on anymore. With her last strength, she picked up
the little bag she had the bombs in and threw them in the direction
of the ground. Xigbar had long stopped descending, and she just had
to stop the free fall. She was almost a hundred feet away from where
they had set off and Yuffie would crash into the massive stone ground
of the plaza if she didn't do something fast.</P><P>The
shuriken returned upon her manipulate command and was then used again
as skydiving tool. The bombs in the bag made a much greater explosion
than intended and Yuffie was virtually blown away. She somehow
managed to slow down the fall through the upcoming shockwave, but
still landed with absurd speed.</P><P>Yuffie
was very lucky. She crashed through a glass window directly into a
grocery shop. The shop was a mess, but she somehow survived. However,
there was no energy left in her to fight. The others must be in
almost the same condition.</P><P>Xigbar
was the same. He had problems maintaining his appearance and was
about to order the withdrawal. He was sure he had killed Axel with
his first supreme attack and that was sufficient for now. But the
girl should be dead. No way could she have survived that fall.</P><p 
align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“So…can't
we solve this by reason, maybe? You're looking like someone who would
understand,” Demyx started to hold a monologue. “See, we are—”
He was cut off by Aerith.</P><P>“If you
wanted to solve this by reason, why did you attack us?” she asked.</P><P>“Well,
you see, that’s…it's not how it looks.” Demyx turned around.</P><P>“Oh
man, I told them I wasn't cut out for this mission. Why does it
always have to be me?” he spoke to himself.</P><P>Aerith
was a bit puzzled by his behavior, and usually she would have tried
to solve this without violence, but they had already attacked them.
And from the scale of that attack, they had intended to kill them.</P><P>“<I>People
of the flames, dance!</I>” Aerith recited, and sent a Fira a few
feet away from where Demyx was still talking to himself.</P><P>“Unfortunately,
we will not be able to solve this with reason. If you don't want to
fight, you can just go,” Aerith told him.</P><P>“Afraid
I can't do that. You see, the Superior would be really mad if I let
you go alive,” Demyx replied, and pointed at her.</P><P>“<I>Dance
Water Dance!</I>” he shouted, and started playing his instrument.</P><P>“<I>Those
that dirty the world, Barrier, protect me!</I>” Aerith recited, and
first cast a barrier, followed by a reflect spell on herself. This
would give her some safety. But unfortunately, her opponent, although
a magic user, didn't use the usual approach.</P><P>Demyx
created quite a lot of his water marionettes and had them attack
Aerith. Up to now, they just shattered on the barrier, but through
that, Aerith took continuous damage. She couldn't put up with this
forever, and reciting any major spell was impossible with that
permanent disturbance.</P><P>Aerith
took down her barrier and immediately let off a gravity spell in
front of her which drew all the marionettes to that one point. If
they just shattered on something simple as a barrier, they couldn't
be very robust. A single grade two spell would do the trick.</P><P>“<I>Ice
that even freezes the time, obey my command!</I>” she shouted, and
sent a Blizzaga flying to where the spot the copies had been
gathered. Now it was time to get serious. Yuffie was fighting up
there and Kairi had her own problems probably. She couldn't bother
either of them to help her.</P><P>“How do
you like this?!” he shouted, and sent dozens of water balls at her,
forcing her to counter them with fire spells.</P><P>“What
do you people want from us?” Aerith shouted while evading the
flowing water balls.</P><P>“Oh,
it's you that want something from us, isn't it?!” Demyx replied and
stopped his attack.</P><P>He played
now a rather powerful tune on the instrument, summoning pillars of
water that he could move around at will.</P><P>“<I>Flood
Water, flood the ground!</I>” he shouted, and sent the pillars all
over the place, the whole forest gradually transforming into a giant
marsh.</P><P>With
water at his disposal anywhere, he would be at a huge advantage.
Although his skills were more focused on information gathering and
other things, he did have some combat abilities. And one of them
would surely let him win this match. The woman had already taken much
damage from Xigbar's supreme attack, and wouldn't stand another
powerful hit.</P><P>“Don't
you think it's a shame to set this whole place under water?” Aerith
called and started to recite her own spell.</P><P>“<I>Great
Earth, powerful force and core of life, rise and show your power!</I>”
she shouted, and just seconds later, the ground cracked open and an
earthquake shook the whole place.</P><P>“Holy,
who would have thought that this woman has that much power?” Demyx
complained, and now switched strategies.</P><P>The next
tune was screeching and shrill. Around him appeared a few bars made
of water, thin and floating in the air. Aerith had no idea what trick
was coming now and began her own spell. She couldn't use her limit
techniques in an one-to-one fight, nor did she have the time to
recite a more powerful spell than the basic grade three element
spells, so she was at a huge disadvantage here.</P><P>Demyx
sent the bars flying. In midair, they transforming into edges that
cut down anything in their way. Tree after tree fell down after one
of those things penetrated their trunks.</P><P>Aerith
could evade the first and recited an emergency protection to block
the next incoming edges.</P><P>“<I>Saint
of the Holy, protect me!</I>” she shouted, barely in time for the
next attack.</P><P>A white
glowing light surrounded her and lessened the damage she took, but
mainly protected her from being sliced in half.</P><P>Now was
the time for counter attacks.</P><P>“<I>Heir
to the skies, hear my plea! Bestow upon me the power of Siren!</I>”
Aerith called out.</P><P>An
invisible shockwave clashed with the water edges that Demyx used and
destroyed them way before they could hit Aerith. She successfully
destroyed his bind to the spell he was using.</P><P>“You've
got a lot of nerve doing that!” he yelled, and played an aggressive
tune. He was now back to the water balls. Despite the earthquake
spell, the whole place around was becoming wet, and soon she would
have no place to hide.</P><P>But he
would not beat her. Aerith had endured much worse and this fight
would not be her last one, especially not against such a guy. Water
was one of the weaker elements, and she now had regrets for never
have learning lightning magic from Cloud. It would have proven to be
very useful here.</P><P>“<I>Eternal
force that binds down all things, cease on my will and lend me the
power of eternity!</I>” Aerith finished the spell, and anything in
a two-hundred-foot range was virtually frozen.</P><P>Time
magic was quite straining, but she just had to try this. This spell
only worked for about one minute and that was not enough time to
gather the force for an Ultima. But to counter his element attacks,
she had to sacrifice this forest. It would eventually grow back and
be more glorious than ever before.</P><P>“<I>Hear
me, oh king of the flames! I desire your power, desire the strength
of the flames, and demand destruction upon the world! Opening the
door to your realm, bring devastation and burns over my enemies!</I>”
she recited the summon spell.</P><P>There
were about five seconds left of the time spell, but the gateway had
already opened. Although it was not the full recitation, the effect
on the forest would be quite disastrous.</P><P>As time
resumed, Demyx was thrown off-balance. In the ground, in the center
of the forest, was a huge crater, burning and emitting a very strong
heat. Where had it suddenly come from? And where was the woman?
Something very fishy was going on.</P><P>Aerith
had taken cover a bit further away. It would only be seconds until
the summon was finished and the whole forest was an ocean of flames.
Casting a barrier to protect herself from the effect of the summon
that was about start working, she recited another spell.</P><P>“<I>Powerful
force in all things, loan me a shell to withstand destruction!”</I>

Aerith recited.</P><P>Demyx
noticed that something was about to virtually set his ass on fire and
had built himself a protective chamber with water walls three feet
thick. He thought that nothing would be able to penetrate his most
powerful defensive magic.</P><P>And there
it was. The summon, the Lord of Flames, Ifrit, made his appearance in
the forest and unleashed his power. Fireballs soared through air and
clashed into trees and the ground, walls of roaring flames set the
whole place on fire, and upon Aerith's mental command, Ifrit even
threw a lava rock on the slightly unsure Demyx.</P><P>To him,
that thing looked rather dangerous, and he enforced his protection
spell just before the lava rock hit the front wall and left an
enormous explosion. Ifrit let out a bestial roar and left the same
way he had appeared.</P><P>Demyx had
only taken mediocre damage but was at a disadvantage now. There was
barely any water left to summon in this now ridiculously hot place.
He wouldn't stand another attack of that summoned beast, but the
woman didn't look like she was in the condition to repeat that spell
anyway.</P><P>“Looks
like I'm in a pinch now,” Demyx said as he looked around.</P><P>The whole
forest was burning. In no time, he wouldn't have any water left to
attack her. He just had to finish her off before that happened.
Playing another tune, he used his water marionettes again.</P><P>But that
trick was already old. Aerith couldn't use the gravity spell now
because the recitation was way too long. It was not really a spell
suited for combat purposes, but there were always other means. One
particular combo should be sufficient to erase all of the
marionettes.</P><P>“<I>Master
of the skies, heir to destruction and the eternal freedom, lend me
your power and blow away my enemies</I>!” Aerith recited the first
spell.</P><P>In the
middle of all this, the burning forest, the torn ground, the
countless water marionettes, and Demyx apparently preparing a big
attack, she created a tornado, which had devastating effects.</P><P>Not only
did the fire around them become fiercer, but the whole place
was full of flying branches, still burning. Demyx had to duck a few
times and got still hit by those things.</P><P>The
second effect was that all marionettes were sucked into the tornado.
That had been Aerith's initial goal. And now she could blast them off
all at once, even without the gravity spell.</P><P>“<I>Great
destruction, devastating forces of the flames unleash your power and
show me the end of a star!</I>” Aerith ended the spell.</P><P>A massive
explosion in the middle of the tornado destroyed all of the
marionettes at once. However, Aerith had forgotten that through the
whole situation, this Nova spell was much much stronger than usual.
The following shockwave blew both parties off ground and sent them
flying.</P><P>While
Aerith was still protected by the shell spell, Demyx had no means of
defense and was hit by a burning tree. This battle was going
completely out of hand. The fire got stronger by the minute, and even
through the protection spell she had cast, Aerith could feel the
heat. It was immense. It was a mystery how Demyx survived this.</P><P>But the
man had enough. This wasn't worth it. He didn't want to get killed.</P><P>“See
you! Visit my concert!” he shouted, and opened a portal that led
into darkness.</P><P>He was
way too far away for Aerith to follow him, and so she looked out for
the others. Going through this forest now was impossible. The fire
had become too strong to pass through even with a shell spell. She
only could hope that Kairi was okay.</P><P>Aerith
left through the crack in the wall and started looking for Yuffie.
She must have left the forest long ago, or she would have noticed
her.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>“Stop
running away, Nobody!” Kairi shouted, in pursuit of the
still-masked Organization member.</P><P>Saïx
was about to enter the mansion when he was stopped by Kairi, who
fired off a Blizzara spell in front of the Nobody, freezing the door.</P><P>“What
is it that you want? Why do you interfere with our plans?” he asked
without turning around.</P><P>“Why?
Because you people attacked us the other day, tried to kill the
others! Don't you dare to try to out-talk me,” she replied, keeping
her guard up. He could launch a surprise attack any moment. She knew
that these people were not as dumb as the Heartless or Ansem's pawns.
This would be a tough battle for her if he decided to fight against
her.</P><P>“Do you
hate us? Do you feel rage when we hurt your friends?” he asked,
still looking at the frozen door.</P><P>“I hate
what you're doing, not what you are. And rage is not the only thing
to give you power and determination in a battle. I'm not dumb enough
to fall for your little tricks, Nobody,” she answered with a smirk.</P><P>Kairi
would not fall for any mind games, she had had enough of those back
when she was fighting Ansem at the End of All Worlds. And this was
nothing compared to what she had endured back there.</P><P>“So be
it, then. I will put an end to this. We don't need you anymore. You
shall find your end here,” he said and finally turned around,
unmasking his face.</P><P>“I'm
Saïx, the Blood Moon Dancer, Keyblader. And my name shall be the
last one you ever speak,” Saïx said, and summoned an enormous
sword.</P><P>“You're
welcome to try, Saïx,” Kairi replied, and tightened her grip on
the Keyblade.</P><P>This was
no ordinary Heartless or weakling. She could feel the power he
emitted. He was most likely much slower with that massive weapon, so
she had the advantage of speed on her side.</P><P>Kairi did
the first attack and rushed straight towards Saïx, making him
believe she would take him head-on. The Nobody just laughed and moved
along with her towards the center and fell right into her trap. Kairi
directed her left hand towards the ground and unleashed a fire spell
directly under her feet. Using the impact of it, she threw herself of
into midair and directly aimed with a vertical swing at Saïx.
Surprised by the tactic, he didn't have the time to react and got
hit. Kairi followed with another couple of hits in succession and
finishing with a brutal thrust at his shoulder.</P><P>Saïx was
flying to the ground, and for the blink of an eye, Kairi thought that
was already all he had. But
she
was terribly wrong.</P><P>Saïx
stood slowly up, moving his neck a bit and making a few cracking
sounds with his joints. He didn't show any sign of damage and now
rushed at Kairi with a surprising speed. That guy was much faster
than he looked.</P><P>Saïx
first did a vertical swing, followed by quite a few fast horizontal
ones, making Kairi jump out of the way repeatedly. One clean hit from
that monster and she would be sent flying across the whole place.</P><P>Looking
for a moment to analyze the situation, Kairi jumped on a statue,
kicked it in midair and used the recoil to land on a wall.</P><P>“What a
monster. How in the world am I supposed to beat him? He is almost as
fast as I am and much stronger. And after that brutal air attack, he
doesn't have a scratch. Maybe I could—”
Kairi was thrown off her monologue.</P><P>Saïx was
beating his weapon repeatedly against the wall, which was starting to
crumble.</P><P>He still
had a calm and concentrated face and didn't say a single word, just
forced her to avoid one hit after another as he kept her on the
defensive.</P><P>Kairi had
to try it. When Saïx did his next vertical swing, she used her
Keyblade and blocked the attack. The impact was so strong that her
joints screamed in pain and she almost was crushed onto the ground,
but she could withstand that. Holding the Keyblade in one hand and
enforcing the resistance with another hand on the crest of it, she
took up a power struggle against Saïx.</P><P>Saïx
started to laugh and looked directly in Kairi's eyes. Her eyes were
those of someone that was determined to win at any cost. Well, he
would give her a chance!</P><P>Saïx
jumped back and waved with his left hand to invite Kairi to try to
beat him.</P><P>Kairi
didn't take the invitation and used instead a Cura spell to heal the
wounds she had taken from when Saïx's had managed to hit her
slightly.</P><P>The pain
in her joints vanished, but mental exhaustion was now a problem. She
wouldn't be able to use magic for quite some time. For once, she
would have been really happy if Aerith showed her overprotective side
and supported her in this fight. This was someone she just couldn't
take on alone.</P><P>“You're
wasting my time. I have important things to attend to, and you're not
part of them!” Saïx yelled, and stabbed his sword into the ground,
trying to open a portal into the darkness.</P><P>Kairi was
in quite a pinch. She didn't know what Saïx was doing, but took this
for a chance to attack him. Running towards him at fast as she could,
Kairi unleashed her full repertoire in an attack.</P><P>In the
moment Saïx opened the portal, Kairi jumped above it and landed
directly in front of an amazed Saïx. She first hit his right arm and
followed with an attack against his chest.</P><P>Saïx
yelled in pain. This time her hits actually showed an effect, and he
was thrown off the ground. Not wasting time, Kairi jumped after him
and continued the combo in midair. While concentrating hits on arms,
hands and shoulders, she finished the all-out attack with a brutal
spin attack against his chest.</P><P>Saïx
crashed into the mansion wall and fell down. That must have been
enough for serious damage. Kairi was breathing heavily then, as she
had used much more force than usual to actually inflict damage on the
Nobody.</P><P>“So…so
you can fight. Then I shall get serious too,” he said angrily, and
summoned a new sword, discarding the old one that was still stabbed
in the ground.</P><P>Unlike
before, Saïx's face was torn in anger and rage; he let out a roaring
scream and from what Kairi could see, his eyes were going blank. That
was certainly not a good sign.</P><P>With a
completely different level of speed, he virtually shot towards Kairi
and sent her flying with a single horizontal slash. She crashed into
the already crumbling wall. She tried to scream out in pain but the
impact had her robbed of her breath.</P><P>There was
no way to fight against him in that state. Kairi got up before he
launched his next berserker attack and fled onto the other intact
wall. But Saïx didn't come. He stood there, looking at her with
blind rage, and then threw his massive sword into the intact wall.</P><P>Surprised
by that brutal act, Kairi jumped off and landed behind the wall. As
if the actual situation wasn't bad enough, a girl seemingly of the
local town was standing there, holding a Keyblade and looking at her
with great eyes.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Olette
had followed the unknowns to the crack in the wall. But she wasn't
able to go any further. As she tried to step through the opening,
just below her opened a mouth of pure darkness, sucking her in, not
leaving her a choice.</P><P>For once
scared and afraid, Olette was surrounded by the darkness. No glass
tower, no Twilight Town, nothing. Just the obscurity around her and
the same voice she had heard before.</P><P>“<I>Darkness
and Nothingness clash to claim the heart of all hearts. One is trying
to consume all hearts into darkness, ever searching for more hearts.
The other, obscures the light, a false truth, neither ally to
darkness or light. The time has come, the door shall open. Power,
Knowledge and Friendship are the keys that will lead to light. The
Chosen shall not fear, they are not alone.</I>”</P><P>Around
her, the darkness vanished into little pieces, shredded away by a
bright light sent from the pendant Olette wore. And beyond the
darkness was nothingness. She couldn't tell if she was falling or
not, but after just the blink of an eye, she was in a place she
recognized all too well.</P><P>When she
looked down, the ornament of stained glass had changed. The redhead,
the girl she had seen just now in Twilight Town, and the graceful
blond were still the same. But the empty ornament, the one with the
crossed weapons, was now showing her portrait.</P><P>Olette
was surprised. This whole thing had been going towards this.
What did this place want to tell her? What was this 'quest'
the voice talked about, and what was the darkness and the
nothingness…?</P><P>Slowly
walking towards the crest of the crossed weapons, Olette could feel
that something else was here. Not the neutral voice, but something
that had ill intentions, something evil. A cold shiver went down her
back and she had no desire to look over her back. Something…was
there, and that was all but a good sign, but it didn't look like
there was any way out of here. Olette continued to walk to the crest
when she got goosebumps from the feeling that someone was watching.</P><P>Standing
right on top of the crest that showed the crossed Keyblades, Olette
called out into the darkness.</P><P>“What
I'm supposed to do now? I don't know! Tell me, or better, let me out
of here!” Olette called, and waited for an answer.</P><P>And the
voice answered.</P><P>“<I>The
heart decides. Do not fret; a choice of the heart is never wrong. It
shall create power anew.</I>”</P><P>Why was
it that everything the voice said made Olette worry more? Now she had
to stand here and make some heart decision, whatever that meant. This
was far beyond anything she had experienced so far, and it was scary.
The voice was bad enough, but the constant feeling of being watched
made it worse. Fearing that she would never get out of here if she
started to argue with the voice, she followed the instructions.</P><P>Closing
her eyes, holding out her right arm, she just waited for something to
happen. But apparently Olette did something wrong, because nothing
happened.</P><P>“<I>Strength
comes with great responsibility. Never waver, never hesitate, but
stay calm.</I><I>Darkness
will try to corrupt the mind, will promise even greater power. The
heart of strength has to be even stronger than the power itself. The
crest is the light that leads, and the light will lead to the crest.</I>”</P><P>Olette
hated riddles. Sure, she knew about power. The strong had to protect
the weak, had to fight for the right thing, that was natural. And
those that strayed from that path would in the end lose their own
self. What about that crest? This whole thing about darkness
corrupting the mind was also not very promising.</P><P>Olette
looked down, standing on the crest. It showed two crossed Keyblades,
two weapons. Was that strength? Being able to fight like this?</P><P>Still
clueless, Olette reached out again, concentrating on the crest below
her.</P><P>Olette
almost let the weapons that suddenly had formed out of light in her
hands fall. They were the same weapons she had seen on the crests,
but to have them real, to see them with her own eyes, to feel them,
was odd and somewhat terrifying.</P><P>“<I>Great
strength is the ability to protect, not to destroy. Righteous
protection and malicious obstinacy can not be discerned by the heart
alone. Knowledge and friendship shall be beside power; fetching it
back should it stray from the right path.</I>”</P><P>The voice
became silent after that, and Olette looked at the Keyblades that had
just appeared out of nowhere.</P><P>They were
both the same, shaped like giant keys, with a crowned crest, the
blades entirely silver and the hilts gold.</P><P>“What
the—are these…real?
They certainly feel like it. But where did they suddenly come from?
And why did they come to me?” stuttered Olette, and gave the
Keyblades a curious look.</P><P>They
really weren't all that fancy or something, plain weapons to serve
the goal of fighting. But whatever it was, if it involved fighting,
she wasn't new to that. Since she had trained for Struggle every day,
this shouldn't be much different. At least, that was what Olette was
hoping.</P><P>But these
blades outweighed the light Struggle bats by far. It would be harder
to swing them around.</P><P>To test
this, Olette did a few attacks she knew from her Struggle experience,
vertical hits and horizontal hits, spinning and hitting thin air in a
jump. It was much more exhausting than Struggle, and a lot harder to
keep control of the blades, but it would work out.</P><P>And just
before she knew it, Olette was surrounded by weird creatures coming
out of the ground, entirely pitch black.</P><P>“You've
got to be kidding me. This is the worst! I'm supposed to fight
these…these…things?! That’s not funny at all!” shouted
Olette.</P><P>The
dark things came closer to her and Olette took a few steps back.</P><P>“Go
away, go away!” she yelled at them, swinging the Keyblades around
in front of her.</P><P>There
were too many. She couldn't leave this tower, and these things were
coming closer every second. There was no choice but to put these
weapons to practical use.</P><P>The
little creatures came jumping at her, trying to scratch and bite her.
Olette hit them by far not as fast as she could with a Struggle bat,
but it was enough to stay uninjured for the moment.</P><P>The
things didn't have any stamina at all, nor did they defend
themselves. One or two clean hits, and they vanished back into
darkness.</P><P>Olette
had the advantage of two weapons and a lot of training, but this was
still not easy. Those things were seriously trying to hurt her, which
was a lot more stressful than the thought of just losing a Struggle
match. One could give up in Struggle and just try again later, but
this was different. Olette didn't think the monsters would listen to
reason.</P><P>This
was crazy! The black things were seriously trying to hurt Olette and
they continuously tried to get to her. Olette let out an angry scream
in the darkness despite that there was no one to hear her.</P><P>Quickly,
but looking out for her guard, Olette literally jumped around on the
tower, first defeating two of the beasts with horizontal swings, the
next ones that came with a jump, fell to a vertical backslash and yet
another one that had appeared out of the ground was taken by a round
and round spin attack.</P><P>It took a
while and Olette repeated the pattern she just used to lessen the
rows of the things and there gradually became less and less of them.</P><P>The last
dark thing fell to her movements, and Olette was quite exhausted. She
had to look for another way to fight, this was just too hard with the
weapons. Maybe if she attacked them more directly, head-on. This was
not Struggle. The enemy wasn't a human. Those things didn't look very
bright, so they might not even be able to defend themselves.</P><P>Olette
really hoped that the test was over now or at least that this was the
last of those monsters. It was a lot more than Struggle. Not to
mention that she had by far enough for now.</P><P>“Did
I pass the test? I really want to go home now! Let me out of here!”
she shouted angrily in the darkness.</P><P>And as if
to answer her call, now a bunch of silver, almost human-shaped
creatures appeared.</P><P>Olette
hoped that this would come soon to a end. She was not in the
condition to fight an endless amount of these things. Moreover, it
gave her a feeling that this was really dangerous. She didn't want to
know what would happen if one of those things actually managed to hit
her. Olette let out an annoyed sigh and tried the head-on approach
with the silver monsters.</P><P>Some of
them were too fast, but Olette had two weapons on her hand, so she
could even attack when something was at her back. While they evaded
most of the attacks that came head-on, they were easily tricked when
Olette suddenly changed directions, and thanks to the all the
training in Struggle, she was rather fast. Slaying them from behind,
most of them fell after a few hits, while others wildly jumped
around, making her often dump an almost-beaten enemy to fight
another.</P><P>However,
there weren't as many as those dark things and it wasn't long until
she had defeated all of them.</P><P>What kind
of terrible test was this? Would Olette be fighting until she would
dropped dead from exhaustion or until one of these things killed her?</P><P>“This
is hellishly stressful, and who in the world thinks of such tests, a
devil?” Olette spoke to herself.</P><P>And as to
answer her, the ground, the whole tower, started to shatter to
pieces. Unable to run anywhere, she almost panicked for a second, but
that wouldn’t help now. A cold, more hellish freezing engulfed
Olette when she fell down into the darkness, and she closed her eyes,
holding both of her weapons crossed in front of her, just hoping she
would get out alive.</P><P>When
Olette opened her eyes, she was surrounded by the creatures again.
But this time, she was in Twilight Town! Time still seemed to stand
still, but it was full of the silver-like creatures. She was back
where the darkness had sucked her in.</P><P>How much
time had passed? Were her friends okay? Olette wanted to go back to
the sandlot, but she would have to make a run for it. The weapons had
vanished but the creatures were now dozens. Even if she had a weapon,
she wouldn’t be able to take all of them on all alone.</P><P>The only
way left was to go through the crack. On the other side was the
ground, torn to pieces, and two people, a pretty woman and a
weird-looking man with an instrument who seemed to be fighting.</P><P>Her
instinct gave her goosebumps and when she turned around, Olette could
see that those creatures were coming after her. They were already all
over the place.</P><P>Olette
tried to call the weapons back. She couldn't just go in there without
any means of defending herself.</P><P>“<I>The
key is all along, always and for all time with the Chosen Ones. Call
free its true nature</I>,” echoed a voice through her head.</P><P>She had…</P><P>Olette
took off her pendant, holding it in her right hand, and tried to call
the weapons back. At first, nothing happened, but then a dazzling
light emitted from her hand.</P><P>It was
not the same as before. It had a curved crest, was golden all over,
and
her
pendant was attached on the hilt.</P><P>This
would work.</P><P>Olette
turned around and ran through the crack. The woman had just taken
cover, and the man was protecting himself with a water wall. It was
high time to get out of here.</P><P>One
Keyblade was not as good as two, but she could hit harder with just
one. Someone was fighting in the mansion garden. Sounds of swords
clashing echoed over the whole place. The gate had been smashed down,
and one wall had been demolished.</P><P>Who on
earth were these people? What the hell was going on?</P><P>Just when
Olette decided that it was not a good idea to stay here, the girl she
had seen running after the man with the black robe jumped right next
to her.</P><P>For the
fraction of a second, Kairi was too astonished to say anything. But
the roar of Saïx got her back to her senses instantaneously.</P><P>“Who—who

<I>are</I> you?” Kairi asked, confused.</P><P>She had
to hurry. Who was this girl? Why did she have a Keyblade? There
wasn't much time for explanation.</P><P>“Olette.
Who are you? And what are these weapons? What are you people—”
Olette was cut off.</P><P>The wall
literally exploded and sent them both flying. Olette hit the ground
hard, while Kairi was able to roll up.</P><P>“I see.
So there was another Keyblader. However, we have no use for you. You
will die alongside with your little friend here,” Saïx said
calmly, and summoned a new sword.</P><P>Kairi
wouldn't beat him. Not alone. Maybe that girl, Olette, could fight.
It was a slim chance, but she had to take all possibilities into
account. Having a weapon, even if it was a Keyblade, didn't mean that
one could fight. But after all, she herself had learned to handle a
Keyblade quite fast, so there was still a chance.</P><P>“You—I
mean, Olette—can you
fight?” Kairi shouted.</P><P>She
didn't have time to ask more than that. Saïx was hot on her trail,
repeatedly doing fast swings, forcing the redhead to concentrate on
evading.</P><P>“Yeah.
A bit. But…what, do you expect me to fight against this guy? He
literally blew up that wall! A <I>wall!</I>” Olette shouted back,
and got up.</P><P>“If you
don't, we will both die here!” Kairi shouted angrily back.</P><P>That was
enough to make Olette understand. This was no game. That guy
seriously tried to kill them.</P><P>“You,
you…don't have another of those things? Those weapons, I mean!”
Olette shouted, finally realizing that she had to go along with what
the girl said to get out of this mess.</P><P>Kairi
didn't get what the hell the girl was getting at. Saïx kept her
occupied and from behind came a sudden explosion that distracted all
three. The whole forest had been set on fire.</P><P>“I see.
So Demyx is most likely beaten. I will not fail like he did,” Saïx
said and jumped back. He would only need a little bit time to get
back in his berserker mode.</P><P>“Look
out! He is about to enter a berserker-like state. When he charges at
you, just evade his attacks, evade them at any cost!” Kairi shouted
to the girl that came running towards her.</P><P>“Tell
me your name, at least. I can't shout 'you' forever. And do you have
another of those weapons? I'm a bit used to fighting with two weapons
from Struggle, so it's worth a try,” Olette talked in a hurry.</P><P>What?
That girl claimed to be able to what? Sure, she had tried to summon
Oblivion at the same time as Oathkeeper, but she couldn't manage to
maintain both of them in shape.</P><P>“I'm
Kairi. You can maintain two Keyblades? Well, can't hurt to let you
try. We need to take any chance we have to get out of here. Escape is
not an option anymore with the burning forest. What kind of Keyblade
do you use? Balance, magic or power?” Kairi asked. “Hurry, spill
it.”</P><P>“Power.
It's what suits me best,” Olette said.</P><P>She
didn't like the tone that Kairi had but Olette didn't know how
serious the situation really was.</P><P>Kairi
picked Hero's Crest in a hurry from her belt and gave it to Olette.
“You injured?”</P><P>Olette
took the pendant, held it in her left hand and tried summoning it the
same way she had done with her own pendant. This one was shaped like
a golden medallion. At Kairi's question she shook her head. She only
was a bit exhausted, both physically and mentally.</P><P>Kairi
cast a Cura spell on herself and looked for where Saïx was. He
wouldn't just stand around charging energy and be a sitting duck for
her attacks. Kairi found him standing on the roof of the mansion. He
must be ready any moment.</P><P>Olette
had managed to summon Hero's Crest a few times but it disappeared
shortly after. Something was wrong.</P><P>“How do
you summon that—what do
you call it, Keyblade? I just can't get it to work!” Olette asked
the other Keyblader anxiously.</P><P>“Try to
think of protecting someone dear or your world,” Kairi answered and
looked around.</P><P>She could
make use of that broken wall. Saïx was only blindly trashing
anything that came in his way, so she could win some time with that.</P><P>Olette
closed her eyes for a moment and thought of Hayner and Pence and the
people of Twilight Town. If she had the power to, Olette would
protect them.</P><P>Kairi
didn't use Hero's Crest usually. It was a brutal and heavy Keyblade
that restricted her magic abilities. When she looked at Olette to see
how her progress was, the girl was standing in a weird combat stance
and holding Hero's Crest in her left, her own Keyblade in her right.
How in the world was she able to do that?</P><P>But now
was not the time for that. Saïx roared and was rushing down from the
mansion towards them. Kairi was about to jump off when Olette hold
her back.</P><P>“I have
an idea. In theory, this should work like beating your Struggle
opponent until he gives up. I've never fought with two versus one in
Struggle, but I really hope this will work,” Olette said, and
started running towards the berserker Saïx.</P><P>Fighting
two versus one was a very efficient method of demoralizing someone.
Kairi shook her head and ran after her.</P><P>Saïx was
head-on with Olette when she jumped and literally flew over him,
leaving him confused. Kairi saw through her plan and rushed as fast
she could at Saïx.</P><P>That was
his big weak point. He was someone who could only concentrate on the
enemy in front of him. He would never attack someone else until he
had defeated the enemy before him.</P><P>Undetermined
which of the girls he should attack first, Saïx got hit pretty badly
in the back from Kairi. She had jumped and launched an attack in
midair on him. That was at least enough to throw him off balance, and
Olette took that chance. She went literally berserk on Saïx and used
the longest combo she knew.</P><P>Kairi was
standing behind Saïx who now was taking damage from the other girl
and she also started to attack him. Nobody could defend against two
sides at once.</P><P>“Now!”
Kairi shouted. She took a step back and was about to use a technique
she had learned from Tifa. Take all your power, rush at the enemy and
hit a vital point with massive force.</P><P>Olette
had her own view of what was called a combo finish. She made a spin,
hit Saïx's chest area repeatedly, and virtually threw him off ground
with the following opposite-vertical double hit.</P><P>Saïx had
reached his limit. He was sick of playing around with little brats.
Just before he could do anything, before he hit the ground, he was
taken by Kairi's attack and literally crashed through the mansion
wall.</P><P>“Did we
do it?” Olette asked, insecure.</P><P>“Doubt
it, but I sure hope so. Don't let your guard down,” Kairi replied,
and slowly walked towards the hole in the wall.</P><P>Olette
waited where she was, quite a few feet away from where Kairi was now.</P><P>Saïx
shot out of the hole with insane speed and before Kairi could defend
herself, he hit her with an incredible brutal horizontal slash.</P><P>The
redhead was sent flying across the place and crashed into Olette,
taking her along. Both crashed on the ground, about twenty feet away
from Saïx.</P><P>“I’ve
had enough of your little games. I have more important things to
attend to!” he yelled, and rushed towards the two girls.</P><P>Kairi had
lost consciousness from that hit and Olette kind of panicked now. She
didn't have a snowball’s chance in hell of defeating this man. He
had knocked out Kairi with just one hit.</P><P>Unable to
decide where to run to, Olette crossed both Keyblades in front of her
and awaited Saïx's attack. He took her head-on, hammering on her
defense, and with a last brutal hit, he sent her flying.</P><P>Olette
was breathing heavily and at the end of her strength. If this went
on, she had no chance. This was completely different from Struggle.
Sure, one could use the same techniques, but not only were the
Keyblades heavier than a Struggle bat, they also had a different
shape and the match wasn't just over after two minutes. The heat from
behind, the angst for one's own life, and all the other thoughts
people had in real combat were a totally new and frightening
experience for Olette.</P><P>Kairi and
Olette both had given all they had, but Saïx was still not beaten.
He seemed more furious then ever.</P><P>However,
Demyx had long left and Xigbar was also not in this world anymore. He
had taken some damage, but that hadn't affected his ability to fight
at all. But there was no saying when the others of the group would
catch up, especially that one woman who had created that barrier in
almost the blink of an eye. It would be a shame to let them live, but
he had to hurry.</P><P>Saïx was
about to finish this ridiculous fight when he was called off. It was
not Xigbar—he would just
have ignored that—it was
someone else from Organization XIII.</P><P>“Saïx.
Leave those girls alive. Our plan will benefit greatly from those
two. We can eliminate them later,” echoed the voice in his head.</P><P>What in
the hell was the Superior thinking? Why should he leave those brats?
One Keyblader was more than enough to make their plan a success. But
he had no choice. Disobeying the orders of the Superior was
disobeying and betraying the Organization.</P><P>Saïx
opened a portal, much to the surprise of Olette, who was left not
knowing what devilish trick would come now. He walked through it and
vanished into the darkness. Left were a half-destroyed mansion, a
completely destroyed garden, and a burning forest.</P><P>Olette
slowly got up and walked over to where Kairi was lying on the ground.
She was still unconscious from that hit and Olette was unable to
carry her. They were trapped in that burning hell.</P><P>But their
rescue was already here.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Aerith
found Yuffie in the grocery shop and brought her to the keyhole
gateway that was still open. There were signs that someone bleeding
heavily had come by, but if one of the Organization dared to use this
portal, Tifa, Leon and Cid were still on the other side, so there was
no need to worry about that.</P><P>Aerith
didn't have the time to give Yuffie more than an emergency Cura. She
had to look for Kairi; she was beyond that burning forest,
imprisoned. There must be another way there.</P><P>Aerith
looked around and found that the trail of blood led just around the
corner. What she found there was beyond her imagination.</P><P>A portal
of darkness, one of these that led to the corridors of darkness and
that could be used to bridge any distance in a very short amount of
time, was standing in front of her. The blood trail ended in it, so 
one of the Organization XIII members must have walked through it.</P><P>Not
hesitating to use the portal, she found herself in a big entrance
hall. The way was too short to lead to a different world, so it must
be somewhere in this one. Through a big hole in the wall she could
see the burning forest. She used the hole in the wall to leave the
hall as the door was frozen, and she looked for Kairi.</P><P>And there
she was, lying on the ground, right next to a girl with two
Keyblades.</P><p align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>Olette
was sitting right next to Kairi, worn out and still not fully able to
comprehend what had exactly happened. The brunette heard a sound from
direction of the mansion, and although it was most likely just the
wall breaking down, she looked there. A woman dressed in pink was
standing there, apparently also injured. That woman was directly
looking at them.</P><P>When
Aerith approached them, Olette took position to attack Aerith in case
she was also an enemy. At least, she had been firing off fireballs in
that forest. A little bit of caution was appropriate.</P><P>“Dear,
Kairi, are you okay?” Aerith just ran past Olette and earned a
puzzled expression from her. “Where is the member of the
Organization? And who are you?” Aerith looked at Olette.</P><P>“I'm
Olette. If you mean that guy in black, he vanished into some kind of
black hole,” Olette said, and sat down. She wasn't able to stand
much anymore. What would become of her now? Who were those people?
Those weapons? What…was she? Who…was she? Kairi would surely know
the answer to these questions, but unfortunately, she was
unconscious.</P><P>Aerith
was quite happy, but on another hand she was just as puzzled. Someone
else besides Kairi could wield a Keyblade? On top of that, two of
them? Now that was new. But at least they had chased away all of the
Organization members.</P><P>“Can
you carry her? I don't know if the Organization really has given up
for now or if they could ambush us one more time. I'm really sorry
that I can't give you a Curaga spell, but let me see what I can do,”
Aerith said, and directed both her hands towards the girls. “<I>People
of light, bless me with your salvation</I>,” she recited.</P><P>Aerith
finished the spell and felt that any more spells would put herself in
danger. She had healed some of Kairi's severe injuries and some of
Olette's, but it wasn't a full healing by far.</P><P>“I'm
afraid we really damaged your world badly. But I'm sure that the
forest will grow back. As for the mansion…” Aerith apologized.</P><P>“Don't
worry. Nobody paid attention to those places anyway. But who are you
people?! Coming out of nowhere and doing this amazing stuff,”
Olette replied.</P><P>“It's
not as amazing as you think. We would rather not have to do all that
fighting. I would never have guessed to run into another Keyblader
here,” Aerith explained.</P><P>“Who
are you? What did those people want? Who are they? And the most
importantly, why do I have these weapons? Who am I?” Olette blurted
out.</P><P>“You…also
that is…I fear I won't be able to explain all this right here. I
think you should come with us. We will have time to explain
everything to you,” Aerith said.</P><P>With
that, Olette was satisfied, and took Kairi, carrying her piggyback to
where the unknown woman was leading her.</P><P>“Oh,
I'm so rude. I completely forgot to tell you my name. I'm Aerith.”</P><P>“Nice
to meet you, Aerith, I should probably say. But it's not really nice
under those circumstances,” Olette said with a false smile.</P><P>“I'm so
sorry for that. We were looking for a way to another world and—”
she cut herself off, biting her lip.</P><P>She
wasn't supposed to tell people about the existence of other worlds.
But this girl was a Keyblader, so she would know sooner or later
anyway.</P><P>“I
don't get what you're saying, but do we have really to walk through
that?” Olette pointed at the portal of darkness. “And how do I
get rid of these weapons?” she asked. “They're really unhandy
while carrying her.”</P><P>“I only
asked Kairi once how she does that, but apparently you focus your
will on it and ask the Keyblade to return to its pendant shape,”
Aerith explained. “And you won't feel much. It's just about a few
steps, and then you're in a underground passage in your city.”</P><P>Olette
tried that, but at the moment, her thoughts were way too messy to
focus on anything, so she just stepped through the portal, still
carrying Kairi.</P><P>For a
moment, there was a cold and impervious darkness, but after another
couple of steps, she was in the underground passage of Twilight Town.</P><P>There was
another girl leaning on the wall, right next to something that
closely resembled a giant keyhole.</P><P>“I
really wonder if I want to know who you people are,” Olette said.</P><p 
align='center'>---Valiant
Hearts---</P><P>He
had finished his own mission. Naminè had successfully escaped
through the keyhole gateway. She must already be in the other world.</P><P>It was
his luck that the Organization thought he was dead. His luck that
Xigbar didn't know he hadn't died with that attack. But he wouldn't
make it. He had taken far too much damage. But he would see Naminè
off. After the woman and Demyx had engaged in battle, he escaped
unnoticed to the mansion, unseen by Saïx, who was fighting with the
Keyblader, and entered the mansion.</P><P>“Axel!
What happened to you? What’s happening out there? Is it the
Organization?” Naminè asked her former guard and ex-Organization
XIII member.</P><P>“That's
nothin'. We're gonna make a run for it now. Naminè, when we reach
the portal the Keyblader uses, you will flee to that world. You'll be
safe there. I can't come with you; I'm still a part of the
Organization. They'll think you're a spy or something. Don't tell
them who I am. Got it memorized?” Axel explained, and took her
hand, dragging her along.</P><P>He didn't
have time to have her agree to everything. There was no saying how
long the Keyblader was able to hold off Saïx. He was a monster, one
of the most powerful fighters in the Organization.</P><P>“But
where will you be going, Axel? Where will you hide from them? Will
you be okay?”</P><P>“I'll
be fine, don't worry about me. I'm opening a portal. We can't go
outside.”</P><P>Axel
tried to ignore the almost unbearable pain and opened a portal. It
was good that Naminè didn't notice the bloodstains he left on the
ground. She would be too worried about someone like him.</P><P>They
passed the corridor of darkness in just a second and were at the
point where Axel had been noticed by the ninja girl.</P><P>“Walk
through that. If you encounter any black creatures that try to attack
you, summon your Keyblade. Just use what I taught you. Never stop on
that path. Got it memorized?” Axel said, and looked down at the
blond girl.</P><P>“Yeah,
I understand that. But what about you?” she replied, and gave Axel
a questioning look.</P><P>“I'll
be okay. I'll think of somethin'. You go now. Don't worry,” Axel
said, and nudged her inside the portal.</P><P>Naminè
turned around, looking at him. “Will I see you again?” she asked
with a worried expression.</P><P>“If you
want, I'll come and visit you. I'm not just gonna disappear. Promise,
we'll see each other again,” he replied, and pointed in the
direction of the other world.</P><P>Naminè
gave him a final nod, a last smile, turned around and did a few steps
on the road of darkness. She wanted to wave a last time at him, to
see him off for the time being. But when Naminè turned around to
look at Axel, he had vanished into the dark.</P><P>Naminè
was now all on her own for the first time ever. It was a bit of an
empty feeling, as if something had been taken from her—a
cold icy feeling that let one shudder for no reason. Axel had been
there as long she could remember, and she felt sad now that they had
parted ways.</P><P>Not
knowing what else to do, she strode forward, towards the world she
knew and didn't. Hoping that Axel was okay and that she could meet
him again soon, she looked back one last time despite knowing he
wouldn't be there.</P><P>Naminè
wanted to call out to him, just to look if he was still there and to
put her mind at ease, but she couldn't be dependent on Axel forever.
It was still strange to be suddenly alone, and by far not the best
feeling she had experienced.</P><P>But he
had promised they would meet again, somewhere. Naminè trusted him.</P>
