<pre>We were in the graveyard
Shovel in hand and digging
Took one step to the hole 
Realized it was not our time to go

We still had a lot of work, work to do
We took cement 
And filled up that grave again, just like new

(Shina) 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

...Hmm. 

I feel comfortable right now.

More comfortable than I have done in a long time. The world 
isn&#39;t exactly a safe place anymore. At least not if you&#39;re a 
Zoanthrope. Times are hard. The shadow left behind by the 
Zoanthrope liberationists should be a clear reminder of that 
fact. And then there was Tylon. Call me crazy, but I don&#39;t think 
there is any other organization connected to the Zoanthropes so 
exclusively. Nor has there ever been such a company to leave 
such an ugly little scar on all our faces. With issues like 
these flying around all over the place; it&#39;s not hard to see 
that I&#39;m used to panic and fighting in my life. 

&#39;Course, that is what most people expect of me.

I am the daughter of Gado after all. No matter how preachy and 
poetic that old man gets, he can still rock hard with the best 
of them. I&#39;m sure that some of that ethic has rubbed off on me. 
And with my kind of upbringing? Heh. Who could blame me for 
being a little bit more battle-happy than most women my age. A 
fact that my &#39;Daddy&#39; wouldn&#39;t soon deny about me. But for the 
first time in a LONG time... I don&#39;t feel obligated to accept 
that way of life as a part of me. 

Stupid as it sounds, I kinda feel at peace right now.

And its all thanks to her.

It&#39;s the middle of the night. So my apartment is kind of dark 
right now. But as I turn over under the covers of my bed, I can 
see her. In all her hyper-active teen glory Uriko. Not the most 
graceful swan in the lake. Not the most intelligent or the most 
dignified. But undeniably genuine. Though she has a tendency to 
be a little unreliable to issues just a tad more than trivial, 
she&#39;s got a heart of gold. She&#39;s shown that to me more than 
once. And I don&#39;t know why but I just can&#39;t help but stare at 
her a little. I fix my face upon my palm and press my elbow into 
my pillow, just watching her.

Watching her sleep. Watching her golden brown hair tilt as her 
shoulders rise and fall with her breathing. All the while, a 
sheen of sweat created from our first night together make her 
creamy skin glisten. And I can she how flushed her cheeks are. 
As much as she likes to make out that she&#39;s mature enough to 
handle a sexual relationship, it&#39;s still all new territory for 
her. Tonight was something special. There was a lot of pent up 
feelings between us. Some times the best way to get rid of that 
tension is to just cave into it. Which was what we did. I&#39;d like 
to think that we&#39;ll take things slower from now on though.  I 
want this to work. And if we push everything... it could just 
collapse around me. 

I&#39;d never want that to happen. 

Ever since I heard that there was a chance that my father, the 
man who had taught me everything I knew, was a possible leader 
of the Zoanthrope Resistance Movement, I was in a sort of cross 
between soldier-mode and kamikaze-mode. I was desperate to find 
the truth at any possible cost. Even if it meant taking on 
people that I would have normally watched my step around. That 
point in my life made me alienate a lot of people that I cared 
about. And it would have continued until I discovered that the 
real enemy was that damn Busuzima, if not for little Uriko. 

I can recall thinking of her as &#39;disgustingly cute&#39; the first 
time around. She was tagging along with that Chinese guy whom 
had been one hell of a player back in the Tylon days. The guy I 
assume must have taught Uriko her fighting style. We ended up 
collaborating to bring Busuzima&#39;s plans down. But through that 
time... I got closer to Uriko. And actually ended up liking her. 
You know how it is when you&#39;re in a bad place. You just want 
everyone out of your way so you can move on with what you want. 
Uriko was the kind of kid that just wouldn&#39;t accept that. Who 
wouldn&#39;t stop bugging me and wouldn&#39;t stop pushing me. To the 
point at which I couldn&#39;t help but smile for all her efforts. 

And it turned my life around.

I&#39;m not pinning my restored sense of direction on Uriko, though. 
A lot of what it took to get me back on track came from 
self-will. And I don&#39;t like to toot my own horn or anything, but 
nobody couldn&#39;t have completely dragged me out of what I was 
feeling if I really didn&#39;t want them to. But Uriko was the 
deciding factor. I converted all my thoughts to where they 
needed to be, just like Dad had always taught me. And in the end 
I came out of that whole mess with my life intact. Now I can 
concentrate on the important things.

Like repaying the one who&#39;s done so much to get me back on 
track; even if that wasn&#39;t her intention. I think it&#39;s the least 
I can do for Uriko. I wouldn&#39;t say that I&#39;m in love with her... 
after all, it wasn&#39;t actually MY idea for us to live together... 
but to be perfectly honest, I think I&#39;m close to it. Closer to 
it than I ever have been with anyone else. Which says a lot in 
the long run. I&#39;ve never been a dab hand when it comes to 
relationships. But I&#39;m not exactly celibate either. 

Just as I&#39;m thinking to myself about her, she stirs. I can feel 
myself pulling a little smile, while my little cat opens her 
eyes and peers up at me with a heartfelt innocence that I&#39;m 
coming to adore.

&quot;Hey...&quot; Uriko says, her voice muffled with sleep, &quot;...What time 
is it...?&quot;

I chuckle a little. &quot;It&#39;s about 3.00 in the morning. Kinda early 
for you, right?&quot; 

And I smile again when I hear her groan. I can tell she isn&#39;t 
much of a morning person Very few people tend to be when they&#39;ve 
spent half the evening together Another sign of how new this all 
is to her. But before she says anything more she snuggles up 
closer to me and rests her head upon my shoulder. 

&quot;I don&#39;t wanna get up for a while,&quot; She says sweetly, &quot;Can&#39;t we 
just stay here for the day?&quot;

Something told me she&#39;d change that tune as soon as she got 
hungry, but for the most part I&#39;d love to indulge her in that 
respect. But then... there isn&#39;t much I wouldn&#39;t do for her 
right now.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

At the supermarket, didn&#39;t know just what we needed
We searched high and low then found what it was on aisle 10
The perfect ingredient for our dead end
To no surprise it was quite expensive but worth the spend

(Uriko) 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Oh man!

I love this SO much! 

Y&#39;know, I never would have guessed that Shina was the cuddly 
type. I would have thought that was something I&#39;d have to drag 
out of her myself. But it&#39;s really happening. And I feel so safe 
and protected when she holds me. Shina is always so strong and 
in control. I know that when we met she was all over the place, 
attacking people without fully knowing whether or not they were 
with that Zoanthrope Liber... liber... WHATEVER it was called. 
But once I got to know her better... I really started to like 
what I saw.

Beneath that hard shell, that spiky sandy blonde hair and that 
tomboy dress sense, she&#39;s really quite sweet and charming. You&#39;d 
think that life being so hard on her would have given her a 
rotten personality; but it didn&#39;t. And she&#39;s had so much to 
struggle with, too. Living in her Dad&#39;s shadow must be hard 
enough as it is. He is considered one of the few people large 
enough in human and Zoanthrope respects to work some kinda peace 
between us. That&#39;s a lot to live up to, even for Shina. Heck, 
even I feel a little jealous of Alice, myself. She&#39;s done so 
well for herself in life and so good at what she does as a 
nurse.  Sometimes... it feels like mom is more proud of her than 
she is of me. So I know what it&#39;s like to feel in the dark 
&#39;cause someone you love casts a bigger shadow. 

But my girl didn&#39;t let that get her down!

She took life by the horns and faced everything. It&#39;s part of 
what makes me like her so much. I wish I could have been more 
Shina in the past. I... don&#39;t remember much... about what 
happened when Tylon was destroyed. But I do remember how scared 
I felt. And when I finally got free from them... I didn&#39;t feel 
happy for a long time afterwards. I was a freak, after all My 
powers were... something I didn&#39;t value much. It was just 
this... weird ability that I didn&#39;t even want. My Mom and Alice 
said that we just have to make the most of our lives and do 
what&#39;s best for the people we love. But I didn&#39;t feel that way 
then. It was the closest I ever came to what Shina calls the 
&#39;breaking point&#39;, I guess 

Kenji once told me about his breaking point. When that Chameleon 
guy forced him to fight against that guy Alice is so crazy 
about, Yugo. He said that when Yugo restored his memories he 
felt so guilty about what he had done. And Mom said she was at 
her wits end when she lost track of me. I think the breaking 
point happens to Zoanthrope out there. And I&#39;d like to think 
that I&#39;ve gotten over it by now. I have so many friends and 
everything. But those times never feel more distant than when 
I&#39;m with Shina.

I feel so happy when she&#39;s around. Even when she yells at me for 
breaking something or  for making a mess, I know if I take one 
good look in her eyes and she&#39;ll forgive me. It&#39;s gonna be tough 
for us to be together. Shina is a few years older than me... and 
my Mom isn&#39;t crazy about the idea of me living alone with her... 
but along as we&#39;re together and I have all my friends behind 
me... I know that this&#39;ll be great.

...I&#39;m gonna make you so happy, Shina...

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Lets not try to foresee what happens now
All we know is that we&#39;re happy somehow

The timing was just right
Nowhere to go but forward now
We only have one rule:
Freedom always allowed

Kaiser&#39;s Afterthoughts

* Meh. I was bored one Sunday and this came out. My first Bloody 
Roar fic. Not very flashy, not very long, but I don&#39;t care 
enough about the pairing to write a full-blown fanfiction on it. 
Maybe in the future... but not right now. 

* The song used in the fic is &#39;Safety Song&#39; by Tsunami Bomb. 
It&#39;s property of them and Kung Fu Records. I don&#39;t own it.
