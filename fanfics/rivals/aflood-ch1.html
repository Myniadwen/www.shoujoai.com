<pre>&lt;please be nice to me, this is my first attempt at this type of genre 
(and  perhaps my last, depending on what mood I&#39;m in afterwards) and I 
know there are serious holes in my writing style even when I&#39;m treading 
familiar  waters. Any feedback will be greatly appreciated, and most 
likely replied to. Send  anything and I&#39;ll be sure to read it. If you 
want to use  this on your web-page or put it up somewhere then it would 
be nice if you could  email me first, but I&#39;m pretty likely to say yes 
to pretty much anything&gt;  

------------------------------------------------------------

     Night had fallen over Seiyun high school.

    While at day, the all-girl&#39;s school managed to maintain a 
traditional and  mothering image, it turned into something much more 
sinister and dangerous when the  shadows began to lengthen. The almost 
Victorian design of the school, with its  marble walls and wide 
courtyards, took on a decidedly gothic hue without the sun to  brighten 
its environs. Not even the Sakura trees helped to alleviate the 
atmosphere,  their beauty hidden by shadows cast by the towering walls.

    It was at this time that the less reputable students started to 
make  their moves. Having slept quite soundly throughout most of their 
classes in the day, they  were fully charged and ready to go by the 
time curfew set in. Most kept to the shadows,  or gathered in the more 
isolated dorms, but the bolder ones stalked the main  courtyard in full 
view of whoever cared to watch.

    As it happened, the main reason for the teachers&#39; apathy was 
standing by  the main gates of the school at that very moment. Aoi 
Himezaki, or just plain Zaki to  those who knew better, was perhaps the 
only girl in existence who could make a school  uniform look 
intimidating. When students from Gedo had besieged Seiyun under the  
command of Kurow Kirishima, it was a simple matter for the headstrong 
Zaki to rouse  the students to the school&#39;s defence and when the 
attackers found the masked  girl&#39;s troops to be even dirtier fighters 
than themselves, the fight dispersed quickly.

    Zaki let out a loud sigh as she checked her watch for the third 
time in  as many minutes. The night was uncomfortably cold as it was 
without Akira being  quarter of an hour late, and the tall girl&#39;s 
patience was being stretched past its  limit. Akira had decided to meet 
up with a couple of old friends from Gedo High over the  weekend and 
Zaki had opted to see her off, temporarily forgetting about Akira&#39;s  
problems with being on time for anything.

    Most annoying of all, Akira would probably just put on that 
annoying  innocent grin of hers and make Zaki feel really bad for 
getting the slightest bit upset at  her. Life could be a real bitch 
sometimes.

    &quot;Zaki?&quot; hissed a quiet voice behind her.

    Zaki gave a low snarl and unconsciously flicked her chain into her  
fingers in one quick motion. Twisting around on her left foot, she 
raised her arm, poised  to strike, and found herself met by a rather 
bemused looking Yurika.

    Zaki shook her head angrily and sheathed her chain, trying to 
regain some  of her lost dignity.

    &quot;Don&#39;t go doing that again! You want to get hurt or something!&quot; 
snapped  Zaki, narrowing her eyes menacingly at the ghostly figure 
before her.

    Yurika flinched noticeably at this and took half a step back, 
directing  her gaze at the floor. A hurt expression appeared on her 
delicate features.

    Zaki cursed inwardly. She had always struggled when it came to 
Yurika.  She knew the young musician possessed hidden reserves of 
willpower behind her  submissive demeanour, but if it wasn&#39;t for her 
siding against her brother the previous  spring, Zaki would never have 
guessed she would so much as speak out of turn. Without  Akira around 
to put Yurika at ease, she just didn&#39;t know how to treat the girl.

    Zaki softened her gaze and leant casually on the gatepost, trying 
to give  off a less hostile aura. &quot;Look, it&#39;s not that I&#39;m angry at 
you, or anything&#133;. It&#39;s  just&#133;.you know&#133; I sometimes can&#39;t control how 
my body reacts when I&#39;m threatened,&quot; she said clumsily, &quot;and, hell, 
Akira would probably have all of Gedo breathing  down my neck if 
anything happened to you.&quot;

    Yurika relaxed considerably at this and smiled gently. *Good*, 
thought  Zaki, *I&#39;m doing something right here.*

    &quot;Are you here to say goodbye to Akira?&quot; The musician asked quietly.

    Zaki nodded curtly. &quot;She was supposed to be here twenty minutes 
ago.  You&#39;d think she would have at least some of her brother&#39;s 
discipline, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;

    Yurika&#39;s look darkened, and Zaki could feel the hairs standing up 
on the nape of her neck. The sharpened tip of the musician&#39;s violin bow 
seemed  to sparkle in the moonlight.

    &quot;Akira is not Daigo&#133;&quot; Yurika hissed, her eyes narrowing, &quot;the same 
way I  am not Kurow.&quot;

    Zaki fought to keep her pulse under control as the pale girl&#39;s gaze 
bore  into her. Despite Yurika&#39;s insistence, the masked girl knew there 
was definitely some  of Kurow&#39;s deadliness sealed deep within her frail 
body and it scared her. Any  mention of the assassin&#39;s name to Yurika 
sent the girl into either a deep depression  or a cold rage. She seemed 
as eager to distance herself as far from her nefarious  brother as she 
was to take all of his sins unto herself, and it was something, Zaki  
thought, that wasn&#39;t going to be resolved any time soon.

    The cloud passed quickly though, and Yurika reverted back to her 
normal  self.

    &quot;I can only hope she is safe. I was never comfortable with the idea 
of  Akira spending any length of time in Gedo, even if she does have 
friends there.&quot;  She said, her voice barely above a whisper.

    &quot;She&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s going to worry much more about you 
than  herself,&quot; Zaki quietly replied, looking up into the night sky.

    Yurika nodded. &quot;I know,&quot; she sighed, &quot;that&#39;s why she insisted on my 
not  going with her: she thought it would be too dangerous for me.&quot;

    &quot;She&#39;s always thinking of other people&#133; I suppose that&#39;s why she 
has  friends in so many different places.&quot;

    &quot;Yes&#133; I suppose it is&#133;&quot; Yurika trailed off, losing herself in 
memories of  the young biker girl. In her mind&#39;s eye, she saw Akira 
battling fearlessly  against the crazed Kurow to free her friends from 
his mind control and then leading the  fight against the demonic Hyo, 
despite the terrifying power that was leaking from  every vein in his 
body.

    She then saw Akira running to meet her when she finally came back 
to  Seiyun High School, her smile one of unconditional friendship and 
devotion. Yurika had  felt truly happy for the first time in her life 
when Akira pulled her into a welcoming  embrace that made her long 
years under Kurow&#39;s command seem a distant memory. As  long as the 
young brunette was there for her, Yurika felt as though there was  
nothing beyond her reach.

    Zaki watched Yurika with some interest, the musician having 
retreated  into a world of her own with a dreamy smile playing on her 
clear features and the  faintest of blushes beginning to show on her 
cheeks. Zaki shook her head; she couldn&#39;t  help but feel just slightly 
nervous about where Yurika and Akira&#39;s relationship was  headed. They 
did seem pretty much besotted with each other since Yurika&#39;s return.

    The sound of heavy footsteps on the gravel of the courtyard jarred 
both  girls out of their respective reveries. They looked up to see 
Akira, fully clad in her  biker&#39;s gear, with her helmet tucked loosely 
under one arm. The brunette&#39;s face broke into  a broad smile when she 
saw her two friends waiting for her, and jogged the last few  steps to 
the gates.

    &quot;So you&#39;re finally here,&quot; murmured Zaki, sharply, checking her 
watch  again for effect. Much to her annoyance, Akira either didn&#39;t 
hear her or pretended not  to, and instead ran straight up to the now 
glowing Yurika.

    Akira set down her helmet, placed her gloved hands gently on 
Yurika&#39;s  arms and looked up into the taller girl&#39;s eyes, her smile 
softening until it took on  an almost pained quality. &quot;Yurika,&quot; she 
chided gently, &quot;I thought I told you not to  wait for me, I don&#39;t want 
you to lose sleep on my account.&quot;

    Yurika opened her mouth to answer, but found herself temporarily 
stunned  into silence by both Akira&#39;s touch and warm gaze. The biker 
girl had the same,  dark, smouldering magnetism her brother Daigo had, 
but where Daigo&#39;s features were  hard and cruel, Akira&#39;s were much more 
soft and forgiving. Her eyes held the same  depth, but were large and 
inviting.

    Strangely enough, Akira didn&#39;t seem to mind the extended silence 
between  them and waited patiently for Yurika to answer, her gaze not 
shifting once from  the musician&#39;s face, whose rapidly growing blush 
contrasted sharply with the  paleness of her skin.

    Eventually Yurika spoke. &quot;I&#133; couldn&#39;t rest without seeing you one 
more  time,&quot; she stammered uncertainly, &quot;to know you would leave 
without my seeing you off  first&#133; it was too much for me to bear&#133; I had 
to see you.&quot;

    As Yurika spoke, Akira&#39;s eyes closed halfway and she could feel the  
prickling heat of tears threatening to burst through at any moment, her 
smile growing  broader with each word the white-haired musician spoke. 
When Yurika finally stopped  talking, Akira crushed the taller girl 
into a powerful embrace, leaning forward on  the tips of her toes so 
she could rest her cheek against her friend&#39;s.

    &quot;Yurika&#133;&quot; Akira whispered, marvelling at how delicate the 
musician&#39;s  slender body felt, &quot;&#133;thank you.&quot;

    Yurika stood, completely thrown by Akira&#39;s sudden display of 
affection.  It seemed no matter how many times the biker embraced her 
like this, she would always  be completely overwhelmed by the rush of 
warmth and excitement it created in  her. She hesitantly raised her 
arms and returned Akira&#39;s embrace, but just as she  felt herself 
starting to relax, the brunette disentangled herself from her and 
turned  back towards Zaki. The masked girl had been trying to keep her 
eyes respectfully on the  ground during the exchange, but couldn&#39;t help 
but throw the odd curious glance in  the couple&#39;s direction.

    Akira gave a short, apologetic bow to Zaki, her expression suddenly  
serious. &quot;I&#39;m sorry to have kept you waiting, I decided to nap for a 
couple of hours and  ended up over-sleeping,&quot; she said flatly.

    Zaki rolled her eyes, deciding she really couldn&#39;t be bothered to  
persevere with her anger. &quot;Let&#39;s just get going, come on,&quot; she growled, 
striding purposefully  off down the wall.

    Zaki continued until she reached a small red cross that had been 
etched  into the stone. She rapped on the wall three times with the 
back of her hand and gave  a low whistle: after a small pause, a ragged 
looking rope ladder was thrown over  into Zaki&#39;s eager grasp. She gave 
two sharp tugs on the ladder to check it was secure  and then dragged 
it across the wall to Akira, who had since donned her helmet.

    As she took hold of the ladder, Akira turned to Yurika, only her 
eyes  left visible underneath the dark material of her visor. &quot;You 
know&#133;&quot; she murmured  wistfully, &quot;You still haven&#39;t ridden on my bike 
yet, I&#39;ll have to take you one of these  days.&quot;

    Yurika smiled shyly. &quot;I would like that a lot. Thank you, Akira.&quot;

    Akira hesitated before finally tearing her gaze regretfully away 
from  Yurika&#39;s beautiful features.  Mounting the first rung of the 
ladder, she turned back  to Zaki.

    &quot;Thank you, Zaki,&quot; she said, her sincerity obvious from the tone of 
her  voice, &quot;this isn&#39;t the first time you&#39;ve gone out of your way to 
help me, I&#39;ll have to  pay you back one of these days.&quot;

    Zaki&#39;s gaze softened. &quot;You can pay me back by coming back in one 
piece,  Akira,&quot; she said, chuckling slightly.

    Akira nodded and shot one last smile in Yurika&#39;s direction before  
climbing gracefully over the wall, leaving her friends behind in the 
courtyard. They  both stood and watched the wall for a short while 
before Zaki let out a loud sigh and  placed a gloved hand on Yurika&#39;s 
shoulder.

    &quot;Come on, Yurika,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;let&#39;s get inside. Standing 
out here  in the cold won&#39;t make Akira come back any quicker.&quot;

    Yurika nodded sadly and followed the masked girl silently back into 
the  main building.

-------------------------------------------------------------

     Akira&#39;s bike hummed gracefully along the long stretch of road to 
Gedo,  doing a brisk, but steady twenty-five miles an hour over the 
speed limit. There was  little traffic to get in the way and it felt 
good to have an open road ahead of  her, as it allowed her mind to 
wander a little without any danger to herself or other  drivers. About 
a year back, Akira had been a no-nonsense daredevil, mercilessly  
weaving in and out of rush hour traffic and jumping bridges without a 
second thought:  but now she was perfectly to happy to just sit back 
and enjoy the ride for what it  was, preferring to admire the scenery 
than break her neck.

    The brunette couldn&#39;t help but wonder what it was that had caused 
this  new change in her. She had initially thought that she had no one 
left to impress  anymore, including herself, but thinking back, she had 
never really cared about how  technically good she was on the bike: the 
rush was all that mattered.

    But as she thought back to the sending off that Yurika and Zaki had 
given  her, she slowly realised that the reason was probably that she 
now had something to  live for. Before, she had just been Daigo 
Kazama&#39;s little sister, who, despite hanging  around with the tougher 
students of Gedo, had always felt slightly below everyone  else and 
somewhat useless, only there for the ride, or to make up the numbers.

    At Seiyun though, she felt as though she was worth something. As a 
close  friend of Zaki, the students treated her with more than a little 
respect, and their  reverence was only tempered by the fact she had 
played the deciding role in turning Gedo&#39;s  onslaught. What really 
mattered though was not the admiration of strangers, but the  happiness 
of her friends. Her relationship with Yurika had finally brought the 
musician  out of Kurow&#39;s thrall and given her the will to live her own 
life on her own terms,  and to her, that was her greatest achievement.

    Akira smiled as she thought of Yurika. The white haired violinist 
was,  without doubt the best thing that ever happened to her. When 
school work, or life in  general started to get on top of her, Yurika 
was always there: her calm nature and  unfailing friendship soothing 
her troubled soul and making everything else seem  insignificant. *It 
was so unfair* Yurika thought, *that she had to suffer like she did. No  
one on this world could have deserved it less.*

    The loud blast of a horn shook Akira violently out of her thoughts 
and  she had to swerve sharply to avoid a head-on crash with a 
particularly large and  unfriendly looking truck. The bike nipped away 
so quickly that Akira was able to miss  to the barrage of incentive 
thrown at her by the driver and she continued on  towards Gedo, trying 
now to keep her mind on the road.  

------------------------------------------------------------

     Gedo was a dangerous place to those who didn&#39;t know it well. 
Hostility  infested the school like a cancer, and the general rule was 
the tried and tested formula  of strike first, talk later: conflict was 
inevitable so it always helped to draw first  blood.

    Akira had lived a relatively straightforward life at Gedo due to 
the fact  that most students made it a priority to keep at least half a 
mile between them and  Daigo Kazama; but she had never been one to sit 
back and be protected and had  frequently gone out of her way to spark 
trouble, which had irked her brother as much as  it had made him proud 
of his sister&#39;s spirit. Although initially sneered upon for  being 
female, Akira eventually managed to earn a grudging respect among the 
boys  there due to her honour and courage.

    Eventually, Akira came to a stop at Aoharu Station: one of her old  
hangouts when she was still at Gedo. The place had not changed 
physically over the months,  except for one or two of the streetlights 
that had now been fixed, but, for lack of  a better word, the &#39;soul&#39; of 
the place had long gone. The rebelliousness that it was  a home to now 
seemed impotent and unnecessary in the new era of peace that had  
descended upon the city. Akira sighed to herself, a sudden feeling of 
sadness rising  within her; it seemed that not everything had turned 
out for the best. Daigo had  disappeared yet again and the normally 
irrepressible Batsu had become solemn and withdrawn following Kyosuke&#39;s 
departure, but she had been so content with her own life  at Seiyun 
that she found it all too easy to forget about what had happened to  
the others involved in Kurow&#39;s machinations. Akira felt deeply upset at 
her own  selfishness as she parked her bike and slowly dismounted, 
beginning to wish that she had  never came.

    &quot;Hey, boss!&quot;

    Akira&#39;s face lit up immediately when she recognised the voice. 
Looking in  the direction it came from, she noticed a scruffy looking 
figure with mile-high  blonde hair trotting towards her. Akira grinned 
and shook her head: wondering if Edge  would ever be rid of the 
ridiculous broom hairstyle he insisted on wearing.

    Akira eagerly ran up to Edge and clasped his hand in greeting. &quot;I 
can&#39;t  believe it&#39;s been this long!&quot; She said, laughing brightly.    
The hood gave his trademark smirk and playfully punched Akira on the 
arm.  &quot;Yep boss, we&#39;ve all been lost without you down here,&quot; he 
replied.

    Akira laughed again. Since Daigo had left the leadership of Gedo in 
the  hands of Edge and the colossal Gan, neither of them had been 
willing to officially  take on the title of &#39;boss&#39;, seeing as the title 
had become almost with synonymous with  Daigo Kazama. The result of 
this was that Edge started to jokingly refer to the  young Biker by the 
title and after a short while, it stuck and now several Gedo students  
had picked up on the nickname.

    Edge had changed greatly in a very short period of time. Although 
the  responsibility of leadership had been split evenly between him and 
Gan, Edge&#39;s greater  initiative meant that he generally took on a great 
deal more. The responsibilities of  keeping Gedo under control had done 
a lot to dull Edge&#39;s more violent and  unpredictable tendencies, and 
had made him a much more controlled and thoughtful  individual.

    Edge whistled loudly and two scruffily clad Gedo students stepped 
out of  the shadows.

    &quot;If anything happens to the boss&#39; bike,&quot; he snapped, unsheathing a 
knife  from his pocket and twirling it menacingly, &quot;you&#39;ll both find 
yourselves on the wrong  side of my friend here, make sure nothing 
happens!&quot;

    The students swallowed nervously, but didn&#39;t complain. Edge then 
turned  his attention back towards Akira and grinned mischievously.

    &quot;Come on boss, there are people waiting.&quot; He said, trotting off 
down the  street with Akira following close behind.  

--------------------------------------------------------------

     Later that night, Akira entered Edge&#39;s house feeling utterly 
drained. She  had found herself having to make small talk with just 
about every Gedo student who  knew who she was and although she was 
comfortable enough with those she called her  friends, she was very 
uneasy in most social situations. Gan had also been absent,  having 
gone to visit relatives in Osaka for a week, which made things even 
worse. She  had also found herself having to deflect several painful 
questions about Daigo.

    Edge came in after Akira and locked the door behind him. He looked  
noticeably tired as he slouched over towards his couch and, with a loud 
grunt,  gambolled clumsily over one of the arms onto his back, ruining 
his hair in the  process. Akira shook her head sadly as she watched the 
young hood stare blankly at the wall  opposite him. Gan had quit Gedo 
to start working full time, and as Edge no longer  lived with his 
family, he had suddenly found himself alone with everybody.

    &quot;You know, Akira&#133;&quot; he murmured quietly, &quot;standing in for the boss 
just  isn&#39;t what it&#39;s cracked up to be. I can see why Daigo vanishes so 
frequently.&quot;

    &quot;Daigo hates having to leave Gedo, he considers it to be running 
away  from his duty.&quot;

    &quot;Yeah&#133; Daigo always had that&#133; his duty,&quot; Edge replied, sounding 
slightly  riled. &quot;He had his sense duty to all the Gedo students here, 
but unfortunately,  that&#39;s something I don&#39;t have.&quot;

    Akira frowned. &quot;If you&#39;re unhappy here, then why don&#39;t you leave? 
Just go  your own path? Daigo may have left you in charge, but he&#39;d let 
you go in an  instant if he knew you did it unwillingly.&quot;

    Edge gave a short laugh, but there was no humour in it.

    &quot;Where would I go? I sure as hell ain&#39;t going back to my family&#133;no. 
I  have nothing to live for right now except what the boss has left me, 
and I know there&#39;s  nothing left for me here anymore&#133; just as there&#39;s 
nothing left for you, Akira.&quot;

    Akira nodded gravely: she had never really wanted to leave Seiyun 
and  come to Gedo, but she felt as though she owed it to her friends to 
visit them. She  was genuinely pleased to see Edge once again, but 
apart from that, there was  nothing here except a overwhelming feeling 
of futility and she found herself wanting to  urgently get back to 
Seiyun where she could begin living again. Throughout the night,  she 
had been worryingly constantly about Yurika, and how the girl was 
coping on her  own. Although she frequently told herself that the 
musician was perfectly capable  of standing on her own two feet without 
her having to hold her up, she knew  Yurika needed her there&#133; and it 
felt good to be needed: especially by someone as  beautiful as Yurika.

    Akira snapped out of her reverie and turned back to Edge, who had 
raised  the knife he was holding high above his head; with a careless 
flick of the wrist, the  blade spun seamlessly through the air and 
straight into the centre of a target that  Edge had drawn carefully 
onto the wall. Akira noticed that there were no marks more than a  
centimetre away from the bullseye.

    &quot;You should have come to visit me at Seiyun, instead. It would do 
you  good to have a change of scenery,&quot; she remarked, suddenly feeling 
brighter.

    Edge snorted.

    &quot;No thanks. That masked girl scares me even more than the boss in a 
bad  mood, and don&#39;t even get me started on that Kirishima girl&#133; I 
don&#39;t even see how you  can bear to be with her so often, especially 
after the whole Kurow thing.&quot;

    Akira felt a powerful rage growing within her. Her eyes narrowed 
and her  voice lowered to a menacing whisper. Before the biker even 
said anything, Edge  felt the air grow much heavier and he stiffened, 
hand instinctively moving over his knife  belt.

    &quot;Yurika&#133; yes, she does have a name&#133; has been through more than you 
can possibly imagine, and in the end she did come through for us, or 
have you  forgotten that already?!&quot; Akira ground her fingernails into 
the palms her hands, not  shifting her gaze from the back of Edge&#39;s 
head. &quot;She has been there for me when no-one  else has&#133; and anything 
you say to her, you say to me as well!&quot;

    Edge swallowed nervously. He had seen Akira get angry many times 
before,  but this was the first time he actually felt true rage coming 
from her, and it scared  him. He was not one to cower, however, and got 
up to face the smouldering Akira.

    &quot;Dammit Akira! I&#39;m showing some fucking concern for you here!&quot; he  
snapped, struggling to meet her glare, &quot;I express my doubts over one of 
your friends,  who has screwed you over once already, may I add, and 
you turn on me like I murdered  your entire family!&quot;

    A voice inside Akira told her that Edge was being perfectly 
reasonable in  what he was saying, considering what he had seen, but 
the brunette was too angry to  notice it: &quot;Yurika is my family now&#133; and 
you, and the rest of Gedo, are not, and never  will be again!&quot;

    Before Edge could protest, Akira ran over to the door, and, finding 
it  locked, she simply raised her leg and slammed her foot into it with 
enough force to  break the lock completely. She disappeared out the 
door, yelling obscenities as she went.

    Edge stared dumbly at the broken door for a few seconds. Defeated, 
he  curled up into himself and closed his eyes, feeling the chill 
coming in from the night  outside. *She&#39;s right*, he thought, *I have 
lost everything. Gan&#133;the boss&#133;and now  her&#133;what the fuck am I supposed 
to do now?*   

------------------------------------------------------------

      Akira rode recklessly fast down the road back to Seiyun, tears 
stinging  painfully in her eyes. She was already regretting her harsh
treatment of Edge, but  couldn&#39;t bring herself to go back to face him 
right at this moment: his comments about  Yurika and her own 
embarrassment still ringing in her ears.

    The biker had elected not to wear her helmet, but the cold wind 
blasting  in her face did little to cool her rage. She had been 
terrified by her own actions and  was confused and upset as to how she 
could react so violently to someone who had been so  down to begin 
with. But when she had heard Yurika slighted so much, something within  
her had just snapped and suddenly Edge had become her most hated enemy.    
Akira slowly shook her head. She had to see Yurika, then maybe she&#39;d be  
able to sort her head out once and for all.  

------------------------------------------------------------

    Dawn was starting to break, and Seiyun was gradually starting to 
return  to its normal, safe appearance. Zaki and her cohorts had long 
since returned to  their respective dorms, their business for the night 
over and done with. One or  two girls that had no lessons during the 
day still kept watch though: Zaki made a point of keeping  a twenty- 
four hour look out at all times, much to the annoyance of many of the  
students.

    The morning sun bathed everything in a warm, orange glow, but the 
air was  bitingly cold. A slow, but insistent breeze wound its way 
through the branches of the blooming Sakura trees, dislodging the odd 
petal here and there, but never  threatening to break into any kind of 
cascade.

    Akira parked her bike by the wall in what she hoped was an 
inconspicuous  place, and, standing on the seat, was just able to reach 
the top of the wall and  hall herself up and over. As she fell down 
into the courtyard, she misjudged the distance to  the floor and landed 
heavily on the side of her left foot. It throbbed painfully, and  would 
probably continue to do so for the next few days, but Akira had too 
much on  her mind to pay any real attention to it, and limped groggily 
onwards towards the  main building.

    Two unfortunates had been burdened with the daybreak shift today, 
and  they both sat motionlessly by the main doors of the dormitory 
building. One was a girl  with short blonde hair who Akira had seen 
around the school several times, but  had never spoken to, while the 
other was a tall, elegant looking girl who Akira  recognised as being 
from Yurika&#39;s music class. Through their mutual acquaintance with the 
violinist, they had talked a couple of times, but as both were rather  
reserved and untrusting individuals, they had never really become 
friends.

    The girl raised an eyebrow as she saw Akira limping silently 
towards her,  her cheeks reddened with tears and her eyes fixed 
unflinchingly to the ground.

    &quot;Kazama,&quot; she said, flatly, in greeting.

    &quot;Ishikawa,&quot; murmured Akira in reply, not lifting her eyes from the 
floor.  She was making to walk straight past, when the girl suddenly 
grabbed her wrist. The  grip was not tight or threatening in the least, 
but it did stop Akira in her tracks.

    With great effort, the biker raised her head and looked the 
musician  directly in her face.

    &quot;What do you want, Mai?&quot; she asked, with a voice that was more 
tired than threatening.

    &quot;Zaki said you wouldn&#39;t be back for at least two days&#133; did 
something  happen at Gedo?&quot; Mai&#39;s eyes went down to Akira&#39;s injured 
leg, &quot;was there some type of  fight?&quot;

    Akira shook her head, &quot;no, not exactly&#133; I must see Yurika, please, 
let me  past.&quot; She said, flatly.

    &quot;Not exactly? What type of answer is that? Was there or wasn&#39;t 
there?&quot;

    &quot;It&#39;s personal. Don&#39;t worry, there&#39;s not going to be a big fight 
anytime  soon&#133; I need to see Yurika, please.&quot; Akira paused. &quot;As for the 
leg, I messed it up  coming over that wall, no big deal.&quot;

    Mai&#39;s look darkened. &quot;I hope you&#39;re not dragging Yurika into any of 
your  Gedo dealings, the girl&#39;s been through enough already without&#133;&quot;

    The musician was cut short by the incredulous look on Akira&#39;s face.    
&quot;I&#133;I would&#133;I could never do that,&quot; Akira whispered quietly: genuinely  
hurt at the idea that someone could accuse her of harming Yurika.

    Mai hesitated for a second, and then removed her hand from the 
biker&#39;s  wrist.

    &quot;Okay,&quot; she said, &quot;but I will have to tell Zaki of this, you know?&quot;

    Akira nodded, and walked wordlessly into the dormitory building.  

------------------------------------------------------------

     Akira had been standing outside Yurika Kirishima&#39;s room for a good 
five  minutes, debating with herself whether or not to go in. She was 
desperate to see the  pale girl, but couldn&#39;t quite bring herself to 
wake her up at such an early time.

    She was just about to leave when she heard the sound of footsteps 
coming  along the corridor. Knowing there would be trouble if she were 
caught, her choice was  made for her, and she rapped nervously on 
Yurika&#39;s door.

    &quot;Come in.&quot; whispered a tired voice from behind the door. Akira 
started.  Yurika was still awake?

    Akira turned the handle and stepped quickly into Yurika&#39;s room. All 
the  lights had been turned off, but a single antique lamp that sat 
elegantly on Yurika&#39;s  bedside table, glowing softly in the darkness. 
In the lamplight, Akira could see the young  musician sitting upright 
in her bed, wearing a gossamer thin nightgown that would  have shocked 
anyone who was used to her normal, uptight appearance. Her hair was  
loose and fell gracefully down her shoulders in thin white strands, 
shimmering  slightly in the lamplight. Yurika&#39;s tired eyes flickered 
with a mixture of both  overwhelming joy and concern at her friend&#39;s 
arrival, her delicate features softened even  more by the low lighting.

    For a few moments, Akira just stood, stunned by Yurika&#39;s beauty. As 
she  thought back to the events of last night, she felt herself 
becoming more and more  angry at Edge for what he had said.

    *Anyone who could be so cruel to someone so kind and delicate&#133;* the  
thought trailed off as Yurika&#39;s lips parted.

    &quot;Akira&#133;?&quot; she whispered, the one word sending shivers down the 
biker&#39;s  spine and filling her with a gentle warmth that made 
everything else fade into  insignificance. She needed Yurika now, 
badly.

    Akira ran forward and fell into Yurika&#39;s waiting arms, sobbing 
freely  into her shoulder. The musician instinctively crushed the 
smaller girl to her and ran  her fingers soothingly through her hair, 
trying to calm her shattered nerves.

    They remained in the same position for several minutes as Akira 
slowly  stopped crying and relaxed into Yurika&#39;s embrace. All that the 
brunette could feel  was the soft warmth of being held by someone who 
cared for her, all her troubles fading  into nothingness.

    Akira snuggled closer to the musician&#39;s delicate body, breathing in 
her  rose-like scent. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she murmured quietly, not moving 
from her position.

    Yurika smiled reassuringly. Even if she was frightened by what was  
troubling Akira; it felt good to have her strength back with her again.

    &quot;You never have to apologise to me; I&#39;m always here for you,&quot; she  
whispered quietly, &quot;what happened to you? You&#39;re back so soon.&quot;

    Akira lifted her head from Yurika&#39;s chest so she could look her 
directly  in the eyes. Raising her arm, she slowly placed her palm 
against the pale girl&#39;s cheek.  Yurika started at the touch, her breath 
coming quicker as Akira&#39;s smouldering eyes  burnt deeply into her own. 
There was a passion burning there that left her  transfixed.

    Akira held her gaze for a few moments and then closed her eyes, not  
moving her hand from Yurika&#39;s face. She didn&#39;t want to tell the 
sensitive young girl  what Edge had said, but Yurika deserved to know. 
Akira couldn&#39;t hide anything from  her.

    &quot;They&#133;Edge, implied&#133;well, said that I couldn&#39;t trust you. They 
thought  you would betray me.&quot; Akira felt her eyes stinging with tears 
as Yurika looked  sadly away, hurt written clearly across her face. 
Desperate to keep her friend&#39;s  spirits up, Akira continued, &quot;I told 
him he was wrong, though, that you had always been  there for me. I was 
so angry I left immediately to come back to you, I couldn&#39;t  stay 
knowing that he felt about you that way.&quot;

    What little colour there was returned to Yurika&#39;s face as Akira&#39;s 
words  slowly sunk in. She didn&#39;t care what other people thought about 
her as long as her  beloved Akira was always there for her. Deciding 
she had been without the brunette&#39;s  warmth for too long, she hugged 
her again, nuzzling the smaller girl&#39;s hair  affectionately.

    &quot;Please, Akira&#133;stay with me tonight.&quot; She whispered huskily.

    Akira froze, images of herself and Yurika tangled breathlessly 
together  under the sheets flashing unbidden through her mind. She drew 
slowly back from the  musician, not quite breaking the embrace, and 
looked deep into Yurika&#39;s dark, yet  innocent eyes. Akira&#39;s head spun 
as she fought the emotions rushing through her. *What are  you 
thinking? This is Yurika you&#39;re fantasising about here! Another girl!  
Another girl that needs you&#133; you can&#39;t&#133; you can&#39;t think like that about 
her&#133; you can&#39;t&#133;*

    In her confusion, Akira quickly lowered her eyes from Yurika&#39;s 
face,  blushing furiously, but looking down meant her attention was 
focused on something  much worse. The musician&#39;s almost sylvan figure, 
and much more, could be seen  perfectly through her nightgown and the 
brunette&#39;s blush grew even more; an  uncomfortable fluttering sensation 
beginning in her stomach, and she became suddenly aware  of a slow 
throbbing ache starting between her legs.

    Swallowing nervously, Akira quickly looked up and found herself 
again  entranced by Yurika&#39;s beauty. *She is so perfect&#133;* thought Akira 
to herself, as she  unconsciously started to lean in towards Yurika, 
one hand gently caressing the girl&#39;s  cheek, and the other one playing 
with a strand of loose white hair.

    &quot;Akira?&quot;

    The biker snapped painfully back to reality with a jarring thud and 
found  herself with her face mere centimetres from Yurika&#39;s. The 
musician had turned a deep crimson colour, and was panting heavily, her 
breath dancing teasingly on  Akira&#39;s lips.

    Akira pulled back instantly. *I&#133; was going to kiss her&#133;* she 
thought,  shivering. *Why? What the hell is wrong with me&#133; I&#133;*

    &quot;Akira?&quot; the voice was more fearful this time.

    The brunette turned away, ashamed and hurt by the concern in 
Yurika&#39;s  voice. *There can be no other explanation&#133; I&#133; I&#39;m in love 
with her.*

    Akira sobbed quietly at the unfairness of the situation. Why did 
this  have to happen? Why couldn&#39;t Yurika and her just be friends 
forever and live out happy, uncomplicated lives? How could she fall in 
love with her? How could she not  fall in love with her&#133;

    &quot;I&#39;m sorry&#133;please&#133;forgive me!&quot; Akira stammered, dashing towards the 
door. With shaking hands, she somehow managed to open the latch and 
then flew out  into the corridor and back to her room.

    Meanwhile, Yurika fell back onto her bed, crying quietly to 
herself. She  knew Akira had sensed what she was thinking and was 
disgusted by it. After the brunette  had been there for her so many 
times before, she had betrayed her trust completely  and tried to&#133;take 
advantage of her grief over her. Edge had been right, she was no  
friend to her beloved Akira.  

------------------------------------------------------------

     The next day came and Akira sullenly went about her daily 
business, glad  for once that she didn&#39;t share any lessons with Yurika; 
she didn&#39;t think she could  face the musician after last night.

    Although the biker was careful not to give any outward signals that 
there  was something wrong with her. One or two of the more perceptive 
students did  notice the despondent aura that seemed to hang around her 
like a dead weight, though,  and one of them was Aoi Himezaki. The 
masked girl had been informed of Akira&#39;s  sudden return and insistent 
desire to see Yurika, and the ever-thinking Zaki had  put two and two 
together and come up with a scarily accurate picture of what happened  
last night. Although Zaki was basing all this upon her previous 
assumption from Akira&#39;s departure, she was confident enough to confront 
the brunette with it. And  anyway, if she were wrong, what harm would 
it do?

    Zaki relaxed on one of the benches in the courtyard, lazily 
watching the  students go about their daily business. She knew Akira 
would have to walk past sooner or  later, and was keeping her 
impatience on a tight leash, trying to resist the  temptation to go 
looking for her.

    &quot;Zaki?&quot;

    Zaki almost jumped out of her seat; she knew only one person in the 
whole  school who could surprise her like that. She looked up to see 
Yurika standing  perfectly still before her, her face giving nothing 
away to even the trained Zaki. The  musician slowly walked over to the 
bench and sat down beside the masked girl, not  looking once in her 
direction.

    After an uncomfortable silence, Zaki decided she had had enough 
already,  and decided to go straight for the jugular.

    &quot;This about last night?&quot; She asked, curtly.

    Yurika silently nodded. Zaki sighed and roughly ran a gloved hand 
through  her long red hair.

    &quot;Look, if&#133; if it&#39;s got to this stage, then you can&#39;t just run away 
from  each other all the time. You&#39;ve got to resolve this one way or 
another.&quot;

    Yurika looked questioningly at the older girl.

    &quot;And don&#39;t play dumb with me, Yurika. It&#39;s pretty damn obvious 
what&#39;s  going on, and you&#39;re just as bad, if not worse, than Akira. I 
can read you like a  book. Perhaps you could fill in the blanks about 
what actually happened.&quot;

    Yurika briefly considered lying to Zaki, but quickly thought 
against it.

    &quot;She&#133; rejected me,&quot; the musician replied, her voice completely 
devoid of  emotion. &quot;She realised what I really felt for her and she 
ran away. She was disgusted  with me&#133;&quot;

    &quot;Do you really believe that?&quot; snapped Zaki, the sharp sound causing 
the  pale girl to look up. &quot;You&#39;re both so maddeningly in love with 
each other that neither of  you can believe for the slightest moment 
that the other could feel the same way.&quot;

    Yurika didn&#39;t respond, her face still expressionless as Zaki 
continued.

    &quot;I&#39;ve watched you two for a while now, long enough to know that 
Akira  feels the same way&#133; if she comes around this way, I&#39;ll see what 
I can do, but until  then: don&#39;t run away from her.&quot;

    The musician&#39;s eyes closed and she remained deep in thought for a 
short  while. Eventually, she opened her eyes again and looked straight 
at Zaki, treating  her to a grateful smile.

    &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, her voice sounding human again once more 
&quot;I,&quot; she hesitated, &quot;I&#39;m surprised to hear that off you, Zaki.&quot;

    Zaki gave a nonchalant shrug. &quot;Well I&#39;ve either got to put up with 
you  two being unbearably mopey all the time or unbearably cheerful all 
the time&#133; I suppose  it&#39;s in all our best interests to have the latter, 
don&#39;t you think?&quot;

    Yurika&#39;s smile simply grew even broader.  

------------------------------------------------------------

     Akira had left school as quickly as possible and had occupied 
herself by  going to the secluded grove where she kept her bike hidden. 
Doing routine maintenance on  the bike was not greatly challenging for 
the biker by any means, but it helped  to keep her mind off the 
problems that were assailing it. Right now, she just didn&#39;t  know what 
to do with herself. She considered staying in this grove forever, or 
perhaps  running away so she didn&#39;t have to face Yurika again. But 
while she felt extremely guilty  about having to face her feelings for 
the girl a second time, the idea of not  seeing her friend&#133;no, her 
love&#133; ever again stung even more.

    She froze as she heard footsteps closing unflinchingly in on her  
position. Although she had no way of knowing who it was, every nerve in 
her body was telling  her it was Yurika. Glancing around, she quickly 
looked for a hiding place. There were  several places where she could 
easily hide, but for some reason her feet were glued  to the spot. She 
was unable to move or escape from her approaching fate; her need  to 
see her love again was just too strong. Fixing her eyes upon her bike, 
the only  convenient thing there to stare at, she crouched, and waited.    
The footsteps stopped.

    &quot;&#133;Akira.&quot; It was Yurika, there was no question about it now. Akira 
tensed  even more, tears starting to force their way through her eyes.

    Yurika advanced a little further, just into the biker&#39;s field of 
vision.  Akira noticed to her dismay that the musician&#39;s hair was once 
again loose, its shimmering  length and her pale skin contrasting 
sharply with the elegant, strapless night coloured  dress she was 
wearing. Even when there was no obvious occasion, Yurika always managed  
to look breathtakingly elegant; it was something that was part of who 
she was.

    The musician was desperate to find her way back into her friend&#39;s 
heart  again, but she also knew that she didn&#39;t want to push her too 
her far. Walking up to  Akira&#39;s bike, she rested her hand on the 
handlebar, admiring the shine and luster of the  metal; although Yurika 
knew little about bikes, she could tell straight away it was  well 
looked after. Akira still hadn&#39;t moved from her position on the ground,  
staring unflinchingly at the bike.

    Yurika moved her gaze from the bike to look directly at Akira. The  
biker&#39;s tension was only serving to heighten her smouldering magnetism 
and it was starting  to affect the musician, the proverbial butterflies 
starting to stir in her stomach.

    &quot;You promised me you&#39;d let me ride on your bike one day.&quot; Yurika  
whispered quietly.

    Akira&#39;s gaze finally moved from the bike to look at Yurika. She 
still  remained completely silent, her breath coming in quick ragged 
gasps.

    &quot;I&#39;d like to ride with you, Akira&#133;now&#133;please&#133;&quot;

    The desperation in Yurika&#39;s voice hit Akira like a brick. She knew 
if she  didn&#39;t do something now, then she would only be deepening the 
wounds she had already inflicted. Raising her head to look at the 
musician, the sight before her  broke her heart. Yurika&#39;s hands here 
clasped firmly together over her chest and she  was shivering gently, a 
solitary, unnoticed tear had slowly wound its way down  her cheek and 
sat precariously on her jaw-line, her white skin had paled even more to  
the point where Akira could have sworn she could almost see through 
her.

    The biker&#39;s resolve hardened: Yurika needed her, and she wasn&#39;t 
going to  let her down.

    Standing up, she grasped the handlebars of her bike and leapt on to 
the  saddle; turning to Yurika, she smiled broadly, the colour 
returning to her features.  The musician almost fainted with joy when 
she saw Akira&#39;s smile; she was  starting to fear that it was something 
she would never see again.

    Yurika placed her hands gently on Akira&#39;s shoulders for support, 
lifting  one of her legs over the bike so she could mount the saddle. 
Nestling her body up close  to Akira, she wrapped her legs tightly 
around the smaller girl&#39;s hips and rested her  head upon her shoulder, 
taking in the heavenly scent of the brunette&#39;s hair. Her right  hand 
found its way up to Akira&#39;s cheek, her finger tracing its slow way 
across her skin  and down to her jaw, drawing forth a sensuous sigh 
from deep within the biker&#39;s  throat. Meanwhile her left hand snaked 
its way down her ribcage, tracing the line  between her small, but 
well-defined breasts; the biker feeling every nuance of the  musician&#39;s 
touch through her thin tank top.

    Eventually, Yurika&#39;s hands stopped their exploring and her arms 
wound  tightly around Akira&#39;s waist. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; she whispered 
excitedly.

    Akira smiled and turned on the ignition.  

------------------------------------------------------------

     The bike purred seamlessly along the road at a leisurely pace. The 
sun  was now low in the sky, and the familiar orange glow had returned 
to Seiyun, but this  time it was accompanied by a warm breeze that 
played teasingly with the hair of the two  girls, who were too wrapped 
up with each other to notice the passing of time.

    Yurika lay contentedly on Akira&#39;s shoulder, the biker&#39;s warmth and 
steady  rhythm of the bike slowly lulling the musician to sleep. Akira 
noticed her friend&#39;s  tiredness and started to head back towards 
Seiyun, but Yurika placed a hand on her  arm, motioning for her to 
stop.

    &quot;I don&#39;t want to go back somewhere just yet&#133; could we stop 
somewhere,  please&#133; just for one second?&quot;

    Akira nodded and pulled off the main road, driving down a little 
known  path that led directly down to the lake&#39;s edge. There were one 
or two unpleasant bumps  along the way, but the biker&#39;s skill prevented 
any serious accidents from  occurring and the couple made it down to 
the lakeside quite safely. The setting sun  illuminated the water with 
a gorgeous fiery crimson, and the air was completely silent,  except 
for the occasional chirping of the crickets. Sieyun, being situated in 
the middle of  a lake, was mercifully isolated from the bustle and 
danger of nightlife.

    Yurika slowly dismounted, reluctantly releasing her grip on Akira, 
and  walked on ahead, watching the water ripple hypnotically in the 
oncoming twilight.  Akira paid no attention to the lake whatsoever 
though; captivated as she was with the way  Yurika&#39;s hair glowed red 
with the colour of the setting sun. The musician sensed  Akira&#39;s gaze 
and turned around to meet it, eyes dancing in the sunlight.

    Akira slowly dismounted her bike and strode purposely towards the 
pale  girl, her dark eyes burning with unhidden desire. Yurika sank 
slowly to her knees, and watched quietly as Akira drew gradually nearer 
to her. The brunette leant  down, and gently brushed the musician&#39;s 
hair back behind her ears before cupping her  chin with her other hand 
and drawing her up into a breathtakingly soft, simple kiss  that 
nonetheless left no doubts as to the feeling behind it.

    Akira drew back and calmly watched Yurika&#39;s face, all of the 
tension and  fear of the past day had long since vanished and now she 
could study the musician&#39;s  beautiful features without any feelings of 
guilt and confusion, watching with  unashamed admiration.

    Yurika&#39;s eyes remained closed for a short while longer; a look of  
complete bliss replacing her normally pained expression. Opening her 
eyes, she met Akira&#39;s  gaze with a pure and contented smile.

    Akira closed her eyes and drew in a deep breath, finding the 
strength  within her to give words to the feelings inside her.

    &quot;I love you.&quot; She said quietly.

    A single tear escaped from Yurika&#39;s eye as she raised her hand to 
clasp  Akira&#39;s.

    &quot;I am forever yours, Akira&#133;&quot; the two kissed again, this time for 
slightly  longer, enjoying the feeling of utter completeness they felt 
when their lips met, &quot;I  love you too.&quot;

    Akira slipped her arm protectively around Yurika&#39;s waist as she led 
her  in silence back to the bike.  

------------------------------------------------------------

     Yurika woke up in her bed the next morning to find herself with 
Akira&#39;s  arms wrapped tightly around her. Looking up at her lover&#39;s 
still sleeping face,  she smiled; it was a good feeling to wake up in 
someone&#39;s arms; she felt more comfortable  than she had ever felt 
before in her life, and she found herself actually looking  forward to 
the day ahead. With Akira at her side, she felt she could achieve 
anything.

    Leaning over, she kissed the brunette softly on the forehead; 
Akira&#39;s  eyes slowly flickered open and a broad smile spread over her 
features.

    &quot;Morning?&quot;

    Yurika smiled.

    &quot;Yes, it&#39;s about 8:50, but it&#39;s a Saturday today and we don&#39;t have 
to get  up for a while now.&quot;

    Akira shook her head, still smiling.

    &quot;I wish I could stay longer, but I&#39;ve got work to go to, and people 
to  apologise to,&quot; she kissed Yurika once before disentangling herself 
from her and climbing  out from under the sheets. Yurika watched 
Akira&#39;s athletic form intently as she  stretched in the morning sun; it 
was a sight she wasn&#39;t going to get tired of any time soon.

    Akira noticed Yurika&#39;s rather droopy gaze, and laughed lightly. 
&quot;You  should go back to sleep. You look absolutely shattered!&quot; she 
chided.

    Yurika pouted. &quot;How am I supposed to sleep without you here?&quot;

    &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find a way. I&#39;ll be back at about 4:00, and from 
then  on, I&#39;m all yours!&quot; Akira smiled as she finished pulling on her 
tank top. She bent over  Yurika and gave her one quick parting kiss 
before heading to the door. &quot;See you  later!&quot; she said, as she left the 
room.

    The musician smiled, it felt good to have Akira back to normal 
again, and  it felt even better to know she had somehow earned the love 
of the strong-willed  young girl. Closing her eyes, she drifted slowly 
back to sleep, to dream of her love  until she returned.
