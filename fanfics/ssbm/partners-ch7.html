<a href="../ssbm/partners-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&quot;Anyone seen Samus?&quot; Zelda was asking everyone in their little group. No 
one had seen her though. It was the morning and breakfast was already 
past, in fact it was at least an hour and a half after breakfast time. 
The second round of fights was supposed to happen relatively soon. Samus 
had not shown up, even after Fox went by her room to tell her where they 
were all meeting.

&quot;Maybe she got flushed down a toilet?&quot; Fox suggested jokingly, but Zelda 
wasn&#39;t joking.

&quot;We have to look for her. If she doesn&#39;t answer to the fight call, 
She&#39;ll be disqualified from the tournament.&quot; Rei told everyone.

&quot;She wants to beat Jigglypuff, so we&#39;ve got to help her.&quot; Fox seconded.

&quot;Hey, how about we try looking in... maybe... her ROOM!?&quot; Falco 
suggested.

Angry stares from all around.

Even though it came from Falco, the idea was good, and Zelda, Rei, Fox, 
and Krystal found themselves in front of Samus room.

Fox knocked again on her door, but no answer.

&quot;Samus, are you awake, todays matches are about to start. Hurry before 
you miss them.&quot; Fox shouted through the door. Still, there was no 
answer. Fox finally decided on calling security or management or someone 
so they could break into her room and check.


I hear voices. Calling my name.

Samus was huddled up in a ball, sitting in a wreckage that used to be 
her home. Pirate ship blazed through the air, blasting human ships to 
pieces. Somehow through all the combat going around, Samus could hear 
people calling her name, trying to reach her. Those voices meant nothing 
to her now. She was in a memory, a dream, reminding her of her purpose. 
Far ahead she saw her. The massive brain, hovering towards her. She 
stood up and ran through the wreckage, trying to get away. Hiding again, 
the brain still journeyed towards her. She tried to run again, but could 
not motivate herself to stand. The brain descended onto her. Laughing 
Her evil laugh, the mother brain entered Samus&#39;s mind, pushing thoughts 
aside and journeying deeper into her mind. All Samus could see was Her 
evil eyes, gazing all the way through her mind, and all she could feel 
was the pain She caused. Suddenly there was a bright flash of light, and 
everything stopped.

&quot;Samus?&quot; she heard a soft voice. Through the light she saw a face. The 
face of a Chozo. 

&quot;Samus, child?&quot; It repeated. Samus looked at him, and then closed her 
eyes.

&quot;She just needs rest.&quot; Samus heard a voice say. Samus opened her eyes 
again, but was not in the room she was in previously, not with a Chozo&#39;s 
kind face looking down at her, but a female doctor standing over her, 
speaking to someone else.

&quot;Samus!?&quot; She heard another familiar voice say. She looked up to see, 
Zelda&#39;s smiling face, accompanied by Rei, Fox, and Krystal. She sat up 
to greet them, but when no words came from her mouth, her happiness 
left. She could see the Mother Brain standing behind them all, smiling 
away, laughing evilly, and everyone&#39;s faces gained an evil look.

&quot;NOOO!!!&quot; Samus jumped up out of her bed, suit lashing out to protect 
her. It half covered her body before she realized, she was standing in 
her room. She looked around her room, and stood at ease, her suit slowly 
retracting. Suddenly she heard her door being banged on, and the suit 
lashed out again, completely protecting Samus&#39;s body, one arm in the 
claw form, and the other wielding a flaming energy blade. She heard 
shouting through the door, and she cautiously moved to the door. Her 
suit began reading through the door and saw 5 figures. The largest one 
was banging on her door, calling her name. Finally he reached into his 
pocket for something. Samus walked to the door and opened it. There were 
two large men standing before her. The one reaching into his pocket 
grumbled at her, and stepped to the side. Zelda, Rei, Fox, and Krystal 
were all standing there before her.

&quot;Samus, are you okay?&quot; Zelda asked, stepping forward.

The two men asked for payment, which Fox reluctantly responded to.

&quot;I&#39;m fine. What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Samus replied.

&quot;You&#39;ve been in your room all morning
