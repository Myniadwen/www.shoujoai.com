<h1>Girl Talk (part 4 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ssbm/index.html">Super Smash Brothers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/grain.html">Grain</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ssbm/girltalk-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>The commons area had been setup to host a small party. All the tables 
and chairs had been arranged around the edge of the room and a large 
welcome banner hung from the back wall. Marth, Link, and Peach had 
organized this unofficial reception for all the new comers who had 
arrived at the arena recently. It was a small get together of about 
thirty or so people, yet it was enough to keep the room alive with 
chatter.  

Among those chattering were a certain two princesses. 

&quot;No waayyyy,&quot; Peach yelped in an incredibly girlish manner, squealing as 
if she were still sixteen, earning the pair of princesses several 
awkward stares from the nearby partygoers. &quot;Are you serious?&quot; 

Zelda just nodded shy, while blushing. 

&quot;Then what!?&quot; 

&quot;We... we kissed.&quot;  

&quot;Really!? So she swings that way after all. I told ya&#39;,&quot; Peach said 
smugly. 

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know... maybe. She did seem kind of awkward and 
embarrassed... But then again, that could just be how she is generally.&quot; 

&quot;So then what happened... I want more, give details.&quot; 

Zelda sighed and her eyes glazed over as she recalled. 

&quot;Ooohh.&quot; Peach perked up thinking it must be something pretty juicy. 

&quot;After we kissed, I rested my head on her shoulder while holding hands; 
and we watched the stars come out. We sat that way for almost an hour.&quot; 

&quot;What, that&#39;s it? That&#39;s all you did?&quot; Peach said disappointedly. &quot;Jeez 
Zel, that&#39;s boring. You&#39;re such a prude.&quot; 

Zelda huffed. &quot;It wasn&#39;t boring, it was romantic,&quot; she said with a pout 
on her face.  

Peach shrugged. &quot;If you say so.&quot; 

&quot;I do say so.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;ve been going on and on about her for months now, and you finally 
get a chance with her and you don&#39;t capitalize... Lame.&quot;  

&quot;It&#39;s a matter of opinion whether I &quot;capitalized&quot; on the opportunity or 
not.&quot; Zelda said folding her arms across her chest. &quot;What we did was 
more than satisfying. And besides I wouldn&#39;t want to frighten her off.&quot; 

&quot;Well I seem to recall some fairly... explicit fantasies involving--&quot;  

&quot;None of which you will repeat in a room full of people.&quot; Zelda said 
sternly with a stamp of her foot, her face turning bright red. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know. Just seems to me like a waste to have not acted on one or 
two.&quot; 

&quot;Can we... stop talking about this in public...&quot; Zelda turned her 
blushing face towards the floor. 

&quot;Ok, whatever. ...Prude.&quot; Peach nudged her with her elbow. &quot;Oh! Well 
look who&#39;s here.&quot; Peach glanced across the room to notice Samus staring 
in their direction, but she quickly looked a way when Peach saw her.   

&quot;Huh.&quot; Zelda turned around to see Samus trying not to look at them. &quot;She 
made it!&quot; Her face lit up. She waved to Samus to come over, but she 
pretended not to notice. 

&quot;She&#39;ll never come over when I&#39;m here.&quot; Peach said smugly. 

&quot;Yes, you&#39;re right about that... Can&#39;t you get along with her better?&quot; 

&quot;No,&quot; Peach said flatly.  

&quot;Listen, I don&#39;t want you to say mean things to Samus anymore. She&#39;s not 
as cold and uncaring as she appears, your words hurt her.&quot; 

Peach smiled, &quot;So you&#39;re defending her honor; that&#39;s really sweet Zel.&quot; 

&quot;Come on, I&#39;m being serious. You don&#39;t have to be nice; just don&#39;t be 
mean, ok?  

&quot;Yeah ok, though it&#39;s not like it&#39;ll be an issue for much longer.&quot; 

&quot;Uh! Y-yeah...&quot; Zelda looked down, ashamed. &quot;Listen, I just wanted to 
tell you again how sorry I am that your stay here is jeopardized. I feel 
terrible...&quot; 

&quot;Ahh It&#39;s alright Zel.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll try my best to make sure it doesn&#39;t happen.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it so much,&quot; Peach said and patted Zelda on the 
shoulder. 

Again Peach noticed Samus through the crowd, staring at them, circling 
like a vulture, waiting for her to leave so she could approach Zelda. 
She was about to make a rude comment comparing Samus to said scavenger, 
but refrained because of Zelda&#39;s request. Instead she just waved to her 
with a fake smile, causing Samus to quickly disappear into the crowd. 

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll leave you alone so you can be with her, though I don&#39;t know 
what good it&#39;ll do since you&#39;re so boring and all.&quot; 

Zelda narrowed her eyes and stared at her for a while before responding. 
&quot;Ok then, I&#39;ll show you boring... How about you don&#39;t come back to the 
room tonight?&quot; 

&quot;Ooohh!?&quot;  

Zelda blushed a bit &quot;Uhh... that is... I hate to ask you this, I&#39;ve 
already put though so much with my requests...&quot; 

Peach glanced again at Samus, who was still circling from a distance. 
&quot;Well, I think you could do a lot better for yourself, but... if she 
makes you happy I guess that&#39;s all that matters.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks... and I&#39;m really sorry.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s fine...Hmm... It could work out to my advantage anyway...&quot; Peach 
said looking across the room. &quot;See ya&#39; later Zel.&quot; She waved while 
disappearing into the crowd. 

------ 

Marth and a couple of the new comers were congregated around one of the 
food tables, chatting. He was joined by a similarly blue haired 
swordsman, though his was wild instead of neat like Marth&#39;s, and a guy 
with a scraggly beard smoking a cigarette. 

He was in the middle conversation with the two when he received a tap on 
the shoulder and a familiar voice came from behind. &quot;Prince Marth.&quot; 

&quot;Peach! Uh... Hi.&quot; He spun around to face her. 

&quot;Would you do a condemned woman a huge favor?&quot; She asked sweetly. 

&quot;Of course, anything for you.&quot; 

&quot;I sort of got kicked out of my room for the night. Think I could crash 
with you?&quot; 

Ike&#39;s jaw nearly hit the floor while Snake scratched his chin 
thoughtfully. 

&quot;Oh, yes of course.&quot;  

&quot;Good,&quot; She said slyly, and began twirling a lock of her hair round her 
finger. &quot;If my days here are numbered I figure I should make the most of 
the time I have left.&quot; 

Marth gulped and noticeably started blushing. Peach looped her arm 
through his and walked off with him, waving to the two left standing 
there. 

&quot;So,&quot; Snake nudged Ike with his elbow, &quot;Think all the chicks here are 
like her?&quot; he said in a gruff voice. 

&quot;I... wouldn&#39;t know.&quot;  

&quot;Hmm, I think a secret reconnaissance mission is in order.&quot; 

------ 

&quot;Why&#39;d you want to leave the reception so soon?&quot; Samus asked as she and 
Zelda entered their room. After about five minutes of the two of them, 
uncomfortably so for Samus, mingling with the other competitors and 
meeting several of the new comers, Zelda had pulled her aside. Samus 
assumed she wanted to talk more, but Zelda only said she wanted to 
leave. 

&quot;I&#39;d just prefer spending time with you than attending some large 
gathering.&quot; Zelda said simply as walked over to her bed. She removed her 
gold shoulder pads, headdress and Hylian sash that hung down the front 
of her dress. She liked the look of all the ornamentation; however, it 
became uncomfortable to wear for long periods. 

&quot;Oh...&quot; Samus was glad to here that; she though things might have been 
awkward between them after the incident in the observatory. She thought 
it odd that Zelda hadn&#39;t said a word about it. Perhaps she didn&#39;t know 
what to say either. Maybe she was just as embarrassed and simply wanted 
to pretend nothing happened. That would most likely be best. Relieved, 
Samus sat down on the sofa and turned the TV on and put her feet up, &quot;So 
are you up for watching Xena now?&quot; 

&quot;Samus... what kind of person are you attracted to?&quot;  

&quot;Uhh...&quot; That came out of nowhere. The question caught her off guard and 
Samus stammered her answer. &quot;Well...I never really... though about... 
W-why do you ask?&quot; Maybe things would get awkward after all. 

&quot;Mmm...&quot; Zelda shrugged. &quot;No reason... just asking.&quot; Zelda sighed and 
sat down beside her, folding her hands in her lap. 

The show was something Zelda had put her on to, and that they watched it 
from time to time. It was about a warrior woman who traveled around 
ancient Greece with her companion, fighting monsters, demons, and evil 
gods. When asked, Zelda said she liked the mythology and gods, which 
were all very different from how things were in her world. That and 
another reason, but she wouldn&#39;t tell Samus what that was. Samus liked 
the action and thought the stories of good versus evil were interesting. 
The special effects were laughable compared to what they were capable of 
in her world, but she didn&#39;t mind. 

Samus had been aware of the large amount of subtext between the two main 
characters, but never paid it much attention before. She only ever 
commented on it once in passing. But now, in light of recent events, 
when the two leading ladies got particularly close it became a bit 
awkward. Hopefully Zelda wouldn&#39;t notice. Maybe it wasn&#39;t such a good 
idea to watch this particular show at the moment. Would it look weird if 
she just abruptly turned it off or changed to something else? 

Though she didn&#39;t have to; at the first intermission Zelda turned the TV 
off. &quot;Can we talk for a bit?&quot; she said. 

&quot;Uh...sure, ok&quot; Samus said timidly. This was it, Zelda would surely 
bring up what happened earlier, and then what could she do? She would 
have to explain herself, but how could she when she didn&#39;t even 
understand for herself 

Samus waited a bit, but she didn&#39;t say anything. Maybe Zelda was 
expecting her to start. &quot;So, uh... are you feeling better about that 
thing with Peach?&quot; Samus said hoping to avoid the subject of their 
earlier encounter. 

&quot;Well I&#39;m still worried about it, but, yes, I do feel better... Thanks 
to you,&quot; Zelda said sweetly and smiled softly at her. 

&quot;It was nothing really...&quot; 

&quot;But it wasn&#39;t nothing!&quot; Zelda spoke fervently. &quot;It meant... today meant 
a lot to me. I found out that you really care about me.&quot; 

&quot;Of course I do.&quot; Samus furrowed her brow sadly. &quot;I&#39;ve never really had 
a friend before you. I wasn&#39;t sure how to handle things like that.&quot; 

&quot;I see that now.&quot; Zelda gave her a soft smile and took her hand. &quot;Before 
I believed that you wanted to spend time with me only because we liked 
similar things.&quot; 

&quot;Oh...&quot; 

&quot;But it&#39;s ok; I know how you feel now. You really were trying to help me 
today. Thank you, you did cheer me up. I&#39;ll remember and appreciate that 
for a long time... and... well,&quot; Zelda looked a her hands a bit 
nervously. &quot;What happened in the observatory... I--&quot; 

&quot;Hey look... about that,&quot; Samus cut her off. &quot;I&#39;m really sorry. It 
shouldn&#39;t have happened. I&#39;m just--&quot; 

&quot;What!? Why not!? That was-- It was very special to me... Don&#39;t say it 
shouldn&#39;t have happened. I... I have wanted that for a while now.&quot; 

&quot;But why? It&#39;s weird.... I should never have kissed you like that...That 
was completely out of line. I have no idea what came over me... all 
those things you were saying... I--&quot; 

&quot;Kissed me?&quot; Zelda furrowed her brow in confusion. &quot;Is that what you 
think happened?&quot; 

&quot;Uh... It didn&#39;t?&quot; Now Samus was confused, she had been absolutely 
certain she had. 

&quot;I kissed you. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s weird at all.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s not?&quot; 

Zelda smiled and shook her head. &quot;No.&quot; 

Certain realizations came to Samus at that moment; Zelda&#39;s behavior 
around her, things she&#39;d said, a flip of the hair, the odd wry smile. It 
was quite similar to how Peach would behave around Marth or Link. It 
became apparent why Zelda had had introduced her that Xena show. This 
must be the other reason she liked it that she wouldn&#146;t tell Samus. 
&quot;You... You&#39;ve wanted to do that for a while?&quot; she asked timidly. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Zelda said with a warm smile, not even attempting to hide the 
blush spreading across her face. 

&quot;Does this mean you like me better than Peach?&quot; 

Zelda let out a soft chuckle &quot;Let&#39;s just say I&#39;ve never kissed Peach 
before, and I have no intention to.&quot; 

&quot;Well, how come it seems like you&#39;re much better friends with her?&quot; 

Zelda tipped her head to the side, curiously. &quot;What makes you say that?&quot;  

Samus shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t know. You just talk to her more You&#39;re more 
open with her.... You talk about things you won&#39;t talk to me about.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t do that. You&#39;re just imagining it.&quot; 

&quot;Come on, you know what I mean,&quot; Samus protested, &quot;Your little giggle 
sessions over in the corner. The two of you call it &#39;girl talk&#39; 
sometimes. You would talk with Peach like that but always excluded me, 
or changed the subject when ever I was around.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, that. Well.... I just didn&#39;t feel comfortable talking about that 
with you.&quot; 

&quot;About what? And why not?&quot; Samus questioned. 

&quot;Samus &#39;girl talk&#39; means we&#39;re talking about who we like, and why, 
and... well, you know... how far we&#39;ve gotten with them.&quot; 

Samus stared a little dumbfounded. &quot;Oh... I never knew that.&quot; 

&quot;And besides, I didn&#39;t really think you&#39;d like to talk about such 
things,&quot; Zelda added. 

&quot;Well not really, it just... it kind of hurt to be pushed away like 
that.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Samus. I didn&#39;t realize.&quot; Zelda took an apologetic tone. 

&quot;Oh wait. So... So you were talking about me?&quot; 

Zelda nodded. &quot;Mm-hmm, I couldn&#39;t talk about it with you there, you&#39;re 
the one you like.&quot; 

Samus smiled, but then it quickly faded. &quot;Hey, hold on! You were talking 
about me... in that way... with Peach...&quot; 

Zelda nodded again, and Samus groaned uncomfortably. 

&quot;I&#39;m not sure how I feel about that...Could you maybe... not do that 
anymore.&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s not that bad you know... but if it makes you so uncomfortable, I 
won&#39;t talk to her about it anymore.&quot; 

Samus smiled and nodded. 

&quot;You know...&quot; Zelda continued &quot;I&#39;ve liked you in that way for quite a 
while now... I tried to get you to notice me too, but you never get my 
hints. I thought you didn&#39;t like me.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m not good with subtlety. I just thought that&#39;s how friends were with 
each other.&quot; 

&quot;Well now you know, Samus,&quot; Zelda said and reached out, talking a strand 
of Samus&#39; hair between her fingers. &quot;And if you&#39;re open to such things, 
if you don&#39;t think it&#39;s too &#39;weird&#39; being with another girl, well... I&#39;d 
want to be more than your friend.&quot; Zelda paused and tipped her head to 
the side. &quot;Is that something you&#39;d want too?&quot; 

&quot;Eh...M-more?&quot; Samus chuckled nervously and glanced at her, but wouldn&#146;t 
look her straight in the eye. &quot;Well... How do you mean?&quot; 

&quot;If you thought you were the one that kissed me, that means that you 
must have wanted to on some level.&quot; 

Zelda had her there. She couldn&#39;t disagree. 

&quot;You find me attractive, don&#39;t you?&quot; Zelda continued. 

&quot;I guess...&quot; Samus nodded. &quot;I mean... you are pretty... Yes.&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s wrong? You&#39;re being so shy. What happened to the cold and 
confidant warrior we all know?&quot; Zelda teased. 

&quot;I... Y-you have an effect on me... especially when you&#39;re acting like 
this.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, is that so... &quot; Zelda smirked and leaned closer. &quot;What kind of 
effect?&quot; 

Samus only blushed, turning slightly to the side. 

Zelda found it incredibly adorable, loving the fact that she had the 
power to reduce the proud huntress to a shrinking violet. &quot;You know, I 
find you remarkably attractive, Samus. I have since I met you.&quot; Zelda 
brushed the backs of her fingers across her cheek, and leaned closer 
still. &quot;Would it be ok if kissing you were a regular occurrence?&quot; 

&quot;Uh well... I don&#39;t usually plan for stuff, so I don&#39;t um...I- I don&#39;t 
know,&quot; Samus shrugged her shoulders. 

&quot;You don&#39;t know?&quot; Zelda pouted. &quot;Ok then, how about right now? Can I 
kiss you right now?&quot; 

&quot;Uh, I guess... Ok.&quot; Samus nodded slowly, but looked away even more. 

Zelda took her by the chin and turned Samus&#39; head to face her. Leaning 
in, Zelda gave her a soft kiss. Samus closed her eyes, tentatively 
returning her affections. She didn&#39;t realize until it was too late that 
she was tilting backwards and ended up on her back with Zelda leaning 
over her, her hands on either side of Samus&#39; head. Zelda smirked as she 
lowered herself down, and Samus realized it was no accident she was now 
on her back. 

The princess got a ravenous look in her eyes as she renewed her efforts, 
vigorously assailing the other woman&#39;s mouth with her own. Samus was 
surprised by her aggressiveness, never expecting the normally reserved 
woman to be so passionate. This was a completely new side to Zelda 

Starting with her lower lip, then her chin, and finally her neck, Zelda 
gently sucked on Samus&#39; surprisingly delicate skin. Her hair fell 
forward, gently tickling the huntress&#39;s face. Samus breathed in deeply 
as Zelda nibbled on her neck, inhaling sent of her hair; lavender and 
something else she couldn&#39;t identify. 

This was odd; this kind of behavior should be setting of all sorts of 
alarms in her head, but that wasn&#146;t the case. She was strangely 
comfortable with Zelda.  She realized she has been for quite a while, 
but never thought about it much  

Working her finger under the collar of Samus light blue jump suit, Zelda 
stretched the elastic material aside and kissed down her neck to her 
collarbone.  

However it was only this level of physical intimacy that Zelda wanted 
now which gave her pause. Sharing a room like they did, Zelda had seen 
her naked plenty of times; either coming out of the shower or when she 
was changing. It might have bothered her if it were anyone else other 
than Zelda. This was different some how. 

Zelda found the zipper that ran down the back of the jump suit and 
slowly undid it. 

Maybe if she knew how Zelda viewed her then... but no... she still 
wouldn&#39;t have cared. She laughed inwardly, imagining all those times; it 
must have been quite the thrill for the princess. So why now was she... 

Slowly the Zelda spread the jumpsuit open from the back and started 
sliding it off her shoulders. 

&quot;Mmff... Zelda... wait,&quot; she said, putting her hands on the princess&#39;s 
shoulders.  

Zelda looked at her with concern. &quot;Hmm? Sorry, am I moving too fast? You 
haven&#39;t ever considered being with another woman?&quot; 

Samus shook her head once. &quot;I- I never gave much thought to things like 
that...&quot; 

&quot;Hmm...&quot; Zelda considered this. &quot;So... is it scary to think that you 
could like girls? I remember it was a bit of a shock for me too... at 
first.&quot; 

Samus shook here head. &quot;I&#39;m used to being different... that doesn&#39;t 
bother me.&quot; 

Zelda tipped her head to the side inquisitively. &quot;It&#39;s something else 
then? You do like me, right?&quot; 

&quot;I do... It&#39;s just... well, I really haven&#39;t.... I haven&#39;t done anything 
like this before.&quot; 

&quot;Never? At all?&quot; 

Samus just shyly shook her head. 

&quot;I didn&#39;t expect that from you of all people.&quot;  

Samus wrinkled her nose and looked questioningly at Zelda. 

&quot;Uh, don&#39;t take it like that.... What I mean is, you&#39;re just so 
beautiful and strong, and quite aggressive in what you want... well 
usually.&quot; Zelda smiled, ran her hand back through Samus&#39; hair, then 
tucked the loose strands behind her ear. &quot;I thought you would have... 
already... been with someone at some point in your life.&quot; 

&quot;Oh... no, I just... I&#39;ve never had the opportunity, or a willing 
partner... I&#39;ve been alone a lot.&quot; Samus lowered her head. &quot;A lot...&quot; 
she repeated. 

&quot;That&#39;s kind of sad... but you&#39;re not alone now. You have both 
opportunity and a very willing partner...&quot; 

Samus blushed and smiled weakly at her. 

Zelda gave her a soft but brief kiss. &quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; she said as she 
traced her finger up the bridge of Samus&#39; nose, then gently brushed 
aside a lock of hair from her forehead. &quot;You&#39;ll like this. I promise,&quot; 
Zelda said as she slid one hand into Samus&#39;, squeezing lightly.  

With her other hand, Zelda caressed her face as she again kissed Samus, 
though, a bit softer this time. Zelda&#39;s hand moved around, cupping the 
back of her neck, lifting up slightly, and tilting Samus&#39; head back. To 
her delight she managed to elicit a soft moan from the hunter. Zelda 
couldn&#39;t control herself for much longer. Her hand went to Samus&#39; 
shoulder, then slowly down her side to her hip. Samus inhaled deeply, 
arching her back in the process, as Zelda hand slid her hand, with firm 
pressure, over her ribs then abs and finally rested on her hip. 

Slowly Zelda made a move for her...  

&quot;W-wait!&quot; Samus said pulling her lips a way. &quot;Peach might walk in,&quot; she 
said stopping Zelda&#39;s advances again. &quot;I can&#39;t let her see me like 
this...&quot; 

Zelda sighed and frowned a bit; her shoulders slumped. Samus really was 
inhibited about this. She would have to put the huntress at ease and 
force herself to slow down some. This was new and sudden for Samus, but 
she had wanted it and wanted it badly for quite a long while. She found 
restraint difficult.  

Zelda quickly smiled and shook her head. &quot;She won&#39;t,&quot; she said 
reassuringly &quot;I asked her to stay someplace else tonight.&quot; 

Samus was stunned &quot;Y-you planned this.&quot; 

Zelda smiled and gave Samus another brief kiss &quot;This isn&#39;t my first time 
with a girl.&quot; 

Samus gave her an inquisitive and somewhat surprised look, then quickly 
checked it, deciding it wasn&#39;t her place to pry. However, Zelda had seen 
the question in her eyes. 

&quot;It&#39;s ok... I&#39;ll tell you. Her name was Impa. She practically raised me 
as a child; we were together always. When I got older, and much at my 
own behest, we started fooling around... and that was good for a while. 
It actually got pretty serious...and I... I loved her very much... 
but... well I think it got to be too much for her. Probably because she 
was more than twice my age, and technically a servant, though I never 
treated her as such. She said she loved me too... but not in the same 
way I did... It hurt... but I eventually got over it, and we&#39;re still 
close... just not the same as before.&quot; 

&quot;S-sorry.&quot; 

&quot;Anyway, she taught me how to love a woman.&quot;  

&quot;Taught you... how...&quot; Samus repeated her. 

&quot;Different techniques; what works and what doesn&#39;t; all the things that 
feel good.&quot; 

&quot;Zelda... could you... could you teach me?&quot; 

&quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask.&quot;
