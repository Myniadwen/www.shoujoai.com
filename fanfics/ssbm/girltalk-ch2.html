<h1>Girl Talk (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ssbm/index.html">Super Smash Brothers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/grain.html">Grain</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ssbm/girltalk-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Not in the dining room, not in the training hall, not at the bazaar; 
Zelda was nowhere to be found. But Samus wouldn&#39;t stop searching until 
she found her. Perhaps she would be at the park. Though, what the 
huntress would do once she found her was another story. Peach was no 
help at all; in fact she only made things worse. Now that Samus was in a 
terrible mood as well, how was she supposed to cheer up Zelda? 

&quot;God, Peach is so... arrggh!&quot; 

Though she hadn&#39;t caught Peach&#39;s last words to her, Peach used the term 
frequently enough for her to be familiar with it. Amazon: a freakishly 
tall, brutish, warrior woman. Of all the things she hated about Peach, 
she hated that most; the way the other princess could get under her skin 
and make her feel like a freak and an outsider, insecurities that Samus 
was already troubled by. 

She knew she was different, that she was rough around the edges and the 
furthest in the world from a feminine flower as any woman could be. And 
she knew most everyone else shared that assessment of her; thought she 
was violent or brutish, and she was often mistaken for a man by those 
that only knew her armored persona. That&#39;s just how people saw her.  And 
why shouldn&#39;t they? Most of it was the truth after all. 

Though, she privately liked to pretend it wasn&#39;t the case. If only in 
her mind she liked to have some sense of normalcy, and as long as she 
could avoid interacting with the others too much, and too closely, they 
wouldn&#39;t have the opportunity to make her feel like she was so 
different. But that damn Peach, it was as if she knew Samus&#39; doubts and 
deliberately attacked 

She was, in essence, a bully as far as Samus was concerned. The Chozo 
raised bounty hunter wasn&#39;t very socially experienced, and felt inferior 
to Peach in that regard, which is why Peach is able to push her around 
her. However the princess wasn&#39;t just some monster she could shoot to 
make it go away, which was really the only way she knew to handle 
problems. Samus was at somewhat of a loss as to how to deal with her.  

------ 

Zelda sighed as she tossed another pebble into the fountain. What was 
she going to do? This situation wasn&#39;t going to resolve itself, but she 
was far too worried and upset to do what she needed to. The more she 
thought about it, the worse things looked, which was only serving to 
upset her even more, when what she need to do was concentrate on the 
task at hand. 

And then there was Samus...&#39;It&#39;s like she doesn&#39;t even care,&#39; Zelda 
thought. The only thing Samus saw in her was a buddy to hangout with; 
she wasn&#39;t a true friend. It wouldn&#39;t take much to make Zelda happy, all 
she wanted hear was: &quot;Hey Zelda, I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re feeling bad. Tell me 
what&#39;s wrong,&quot; and maybe to hold her hand, and maybe a hug, maybe even 
for her to... 

&quot;Humph, like that would ever happen,&quot; Zelda mumbled. 

Not that Zelda could spare time to focus on Samus right now; she had to 
think, had to prepare. 

&quot;I thought you had something important to do.&quot; 

Startled, Zelda jumped, dropping her fist full of pebbles, but didn&#39;t 
turn around to face Samus. &quot;I do... uh, not this.&quot; 

&quot;Well then let&#39;s go.&quot; 

&quot;Go where?&quot; 

&quot;Anywhere... lets do something fun.&quot; 

&quot;Ugh...&quot; Zelda groaned. That again? That really was all Samus cared 
about. She left the room earlier to get a way from such pestering, but 
apparently Samus was resolute enough to track her down. &quot;I told you, I 
have important things to take care of.&quot; 

&quot;Obviously not that important if this is how you&#39;re spending your time. 
So just come with me already.&quot; Samus didn&#39;t wait for an answer; she took 
Zelda by the wrist and pulled her to her feet. 

&quot;Alright, fine... You don&#39;t have to be so pushy,&quot; Zelda grumbled. She 
pulled her hand away from Samus and followed closely behind her. &quot;Where 
are we going anyway?&quot; 

&quot;You hungry?&quot; 

&quot;A little,&quot; Zelda admitted reluctantly. 

&quot;Let&#39;s go get some pancakes.&quot; 

&quot;Isn&#39;t it a little late in the day for breakfast?&quot;  

&quot;Yeah, well... I noticed you didn&#39;t eat this morning, so let&#39;s go to 
that place in the bazaar we used to go to.&quot; 

They did, and they both had their usual order of pancakes; Zelda&#39;s with 
maple syrup, and Samus&#39; with butter. Zelda was moody the whole time, 
practically refusing to engage in conversation; she usually loved 
pancakes, but she only finished half of hers. With Zelda&#39;s mood now 
beginning to infect Samus as well, they both left the diner brooding. 

&quot;Oh look the theater, let&#39;s go see something,&quot; Samus said upon seeing 
the theater across from the diner. 

&quot;I&#39;d rather not,&quot; Zelda sighed. 

&quot;Oh come on, we haven&#39;t gone in forever.&quot; 

Zelda reluctantly agreed, thinking that maybe if she gave Samus more of 
a chance she&#39;d eventually show some sign that she cared. As usual, Samus 
made comments to her about the show, which she normally enjoyed or even 
laughed at. But this time Zelda only sat staring down at the back of the 
seat in front of her. Each time Samus spoke she hoped it would be to 
show some small sign of concern, but it never came. And with every 
comment Zelda&#39;s depression only grew, eventually becoming convinced she 
was right about Samus. They left the theater with Zelda more depressed 
than ever and Samus getting discouraged. 

&quot;So what&#39;d you think of it?&quot; Samus said as they exited. 

&quot;Eh...&quot; Zelda shrugged. 

Samus sighed. &#39;Zelda, what does it take?&#39; Zelda always had an opinion to 
spare about whatever they had seen; it was like the girl she knew had 
gone entirely.  

She wouldn&#39;t give up, though; she had much more planned, something had 
to work. &quot;Hey lets go--&quot; 

&quot;Have you had enough fun yet? Can I go now?&quot; Zelda sounded annoyed. 

&#39;Why won&#39;t you snap out of it?&#39; Samus sighed. &quot;Come on, I still want 
to...&quot;  

&quot;Is this all I am to you!?&quot; Zelda finally voiced her concern. 

&quot;All...? What do you mean... all you are?&quot; Samus was truly confused. 

&quot;You don&#39;t really care about me at all, do you?&quot;  

&quot;What!? What do you mean?&quot; How could Zelda think that after today? &quot;Why 
do you think we&#39;re here?&quot; 

&quot;You just want to have someone to hang out with... to do fun things with 
you. It doesn&#39;t matter how I feel,&quot; Zelda sulked. 

&quot;It does matter! ...This stuff usually makes you happy. That&#39;s why-&quot; 

Zelda cut her off. &quot;Why haven&#39;t you even bothered to ask me what&#39;s 
wrong?&quot; she asked, a definite note of pain in her voice. 

Samus looked dumbfounded; it was so simple, but she never would have 
thought to do so; she had always felt that Zelda kept her at a distance 
and wouldn&#39;t let her in. &quot;I... I never thought you&#39;d want to talk to me 
about it. I thought you&#39;d only want to talk about it with friends.&quot; 

Zelda took a step back, a look of pained shock on her face. &quot;Samus, you 
are my friend! ...at least ...I hoped you were,&quot; she said sadly. 

&quot;I meant good friends, ones you&#39;re close with, that you talk with 
normally...  like you do with Peach... You told her,&quot; Samus said, 
sounding every bit as jealous as she actually was. 

&quot;I told her because she asked!&quot;  

Samus appeared to be at a loss, she didn&#39;t really have a response for 
that. 

&quot;Well that, and it involves her directly,&quot; Zelda continued, &quot;so I had to 
tell her...&quot;  

&quot;Wait... it&#39;s Peach&#39;s fault you upset?&quot; This only angered Samus. &quot;Damn 
her.&quot; 

&quot;No, it&#39;s not.&quot; Zelda again got annoyed, Samus always got difficult 
every time Peach&#39;s name came up.  

&quot;So... then what is bothering you?&quot; Samus asked cautiously. 

Zelda sighed sarcastically. &quot;Are you sure you even care?&quot; 

Samus felt hurt, &quot;Is it...Are you&#39;re mad because I haven&#39;t asked you?&quot; 

Zelda pouted and folded her arms. &quot;Partly... Yes... A lot, actually.&quot;  

Guilt and shame aren&#39;t feelings that Samus experienced often, but now 
they came in abundance. Here she had been worried about Zelda all this 
time when in fact she was part of the problem. &quot;So it&#39;s my fault then. 
You&#39;re like this because of me.&quot; 

&quot;You could have at least shown a little sympathy!&quot; 

Samus shrunk away. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t know... ugh.&quot; Guilt was a 
terrible feeling. &quot;I&#39;m not good with things like this. I do care, 
really.&quot;  

Zelda glared at her, half scowling, half pouting, considering whether to 
believe her or not. 

&quot;What... um, what were you upset about in the first place?&quot; Samus 
finally asked what she should have long ago, knowing full well it was 
too little too late. 

Zelda sighed and looked down at her hands while fiddling with her 
fingers. She sighed again. &quot;They&#39;re going to send Peach home.&quot; 

&quot;Wait, that&#39;s it? That&#39;s not bad at all.&quot;  

&quot;Samus! Damn it. Can&#39;t you just get along with her?&quot; 

&quot;With her? I&#39;d rather eat broken glass.&quot; 

&quot;Ugh!&quot; Zelda groaned in frustration. &quot;Just forget it. I was a fool to 
think you&#39;d give a damn. I&#39;m going,&quot; she said angrily, then turned 
around to leave. 

&quot;Ah... Wait!&quot; Samus stopped her. Crap, what the hell did she just say 
that for? &quot;I&#39;m Sorry! I&#39;m uh... Don&#39;t go, ok. Zelda, just...&quot; Samus 
fumbled around for something to say. She knew she was bad at this and 
that she screwed things up terribly, but she desperately didn&#39;t want 
Zelda to go away mad at her. &quot;Why don&#39;t you tell me about it?&quot; she said 
finally.  

Zelda looked sternly at her, seemingly judging her sincerity. It was a 
sunny day and the weather was slightly warm; though the environment here 
on the campus was controlled to a degree so it was always a temperate 
climate. Crowds of stadium goers and spectators passed them on walkway 
as they stood silently facing each other, most probably not realizing 
the two were competitors in the tournaments. Samus shifted her weight 
from one foot to the other, then furrowed her brow and looked her 
companion in the eye. 

Zelda sighed and gave in; she would give Samus one more chance. She 
looked to the ground briefly, brushed her hair behind her pointed ear, 
and then looked back up to Samus. &quot;Well I asked her to help me get back 
at Link for being a jerk and forgetting... well a very important day for 
us Hylians...&quot; Zelda sighed then continued &quot;I can&#39;t believe I agreed to 
something so irresponsible...I was just so mad, and it seemed like a 
good idea when we talked about it...&quot; 

&quot;What did she do?&quot; Samus asked, her curiosity piqued.  

&quot;They were partnered together in an important match and she deliberately 
made them lose. Link was quite upset about that and complained a great 
deal. Eventually the people who run the tournaments found out and 
apparently there were a lot of people betting lots of money on 
him....Peach got in serious trouble and now they may send her back to 
her own world and never allow her to return.&quot; 

&quot;Oh... sorry about that, I guess... um...&quot; Samus had to fight hard to 
keep from showing her delight at this news. 

&quot;It&#39;s ok; you can smile all you want. Go ahead and jump for joy.&quot;  

Damn, Zelda read her like a book. &quot;Zelda, I wouldn&#39;t... it&#39;s not like 
that. Ok, so, she&#39;s going away, but its not so bad right? Can&#39;t you 
still go visit her or something?&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s not the point. It&#39;s my fault, I&#39;m responsible...if she gets sent 
away it will be because of me. I should never have involved her, I 
shouldn&#39;t have ever tried to get revenge on Link.&quot; Zelda sighed and 
stared at the sidewalk &quot;That was the most stupid and petty I&#39;ve ever 
done,&quot; Zelda said sadly and hung her head. 

&quot;I&#39;m sure hanging out with Peach had something to do with that.&quot; Samus 
muttered under her breath. She was like a plague, ruining everything she 
touched; even Zelda wasn&#39;t immune. As far as Samus was concerned she was 
entirely to blame and was getting everything she deserved. She wanted to 
tell Zelda as much and that she shouldn&#39;t blame herself, but knew that 
wouldn&#39;t really help the situation. 

&quot;What?&quot; Zelda looked at her not catching what she said. 

&quot;Uh... why don&#39;t you just tell them she did it for you... No, then 
they&#39;d just send you away... Hmm...&quot; Samus pulled on her left ear as was 
her habit when thinking too hard. 

&quot;Ugh... Well I do have a chance to prevent it.&quot; Zelda broke in. &quot;Next 
week there is a hearing; I will be given an opportunity to convince them 
to allow her to stay.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s good then, right? You&#39;re pretty smart; you can probably convince 
them of anything.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s not that simple, the laws they have here are intricate and 
complex. I know Hylian law by heart, but this place is different. I&#39;ve 
been studying them for the last couple weeks and forming my argument.... 
but I... well it&#39;s just so much pressure, I don&#39;t think I can keep it 
together in there. If I fail, Peach will have to leave... and I&#39;ll never 
see here again. And that&#39;s just making me even more nervous and likely 
to make mistakes,&quot; Zelda ranted a bit. &quot;I just can&#39;t seem to focus 
anymore,&quot; she added with sigh and hung her head. 

&quot;Well... at least you&#39;re not in trouble. You still get to stay even if 
you fail completely.&quot; Samus said smiling but then realized it was a dumb 
thing to say the moment it escaped her lips.  

Zelda huffed. &quot;I can&#39;t waste time here like this. I need to 
concentrate...&quot; Zelda sounded irritated. &quot;I just need to think... I.... 
I have to go. See you later.&quot;  

That could have gone a lot better. &quot;Yeah, ok... See you...&quot; Samus 
worriedly watched her leave, knowing she handled things badly. 

&quot;Damn,&quot; she sighed.
