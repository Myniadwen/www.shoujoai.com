<h1>Girl Talk (part 1 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ssbm/index.html">Super Smash Brothers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/grain.html">Grain</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The flaxen-haired warrior walked down the hall to her shared dorm room. 
She currently resided here on this campus that was home to a spectacular 
arena. It was a special kind of world, linked to many other worlds, a 
sort of inter-dimensional nexus; a place where many strange types of 
people gathered to participate in grand battles. Taking some time off 
from bounty hunting for the Galactic Federation, Samus Aran would 
sometimes come here and participate in the competitions.  

The purpose of the arena and the tournaments held there was merely to 
provide entertainment for the spectators, who not only included the 
stadium going fans, but also those that bet heavily on the outcomes of 
the fights.  Most of the competitors, however, had their own reasons for 
crossing over from their own universes in order to compete. Some came 
because they enjoyed the competition and attention from the cheering 
fans, others because they had something to prove. Some were here to 
support their friends who they followed to this place. 

She though, being that she always had to be different, had another 
reason entirely. She viewed the whole thing as an elaborate training 
exercise. Fighting against unique warriors and bizarre creatures from 
alternate existences offered an opportunity to sharpen her skills and 
take her abilities to new heights. She was uncomfortable sitting still, 
and when things got quiet in the Federation, this was how she kept 
herself occupied. 

Samus fumbled with the card key before managing to swipe it through the 
slot. She stood still for a few moments with her hand on the knob of the 
unlocked door, mentally preparing herself, knowing what most likely 
awaited her. Her head hung, she took a breath then pushed the door open.  

Zelda barely picked her head up from the desk as Samus entered, then 
went back to resting on her forearms, folded on the tabletop, without 
saying a word to Samus.  

&quot;Still in a mood I see,&quot; said Samus, frustrated to see her friend in 
such miserable condition. 

She had been like this for almost a week now, and had been getting worse 
day by day, though, the change from her usual, pleasant demeanor was 
very sudden and noticeable. She didn&#39;t smile anymore, and she was a lot 
less talkative than normal. She almost reminded Samus of herself 
before... well before she met Zelda.  

It was her that was the grumpy-with-no-reason loaner for the longest 
time. That was until Zelda befriended her and brought her out of her 
shell, so it really bothered her to see the Hylian Princess this way. 
Though now Samus was more sociable with most other competitors here at 
the arena, Zelda was the only person she&#39;d consider an actual friend. 
The rest were merely acquaintances that she got along with, or at worst, 
tolerated.  

And the two of them truly were friends, doing all the usual things 
friends did together. Things such as going to the concerts infrequently 
held on the arena&#39;s campus, eating lunch together most of the time, just 
hanging out and watching TV in their room, or training together on 
occasion; Samus was teaching Zelda to be a better fighter. 

Though she thought their friendship began when she accidentally 
discovered they had the same taste in music, upon reflection she 
realized that Zelda had been especially nice towards her long before 
that, she just never noticed at the time. 

Samus stared at her from the across the room. After a short while, she 
felt her annoyance rising. Why couldn&#39;t Zelda just go back to the way 
she was before, the way she liked her. She was spurred to action and she 
made up her mind that she&#39;d do what ever it took to cheer her up. 

&quot;Zelda... hey, want to watch Xena?&quot; Samus said as she clicked on the TV. 
Xena was a TV show that Zelda had introduced her to, and that they 
watched regularly. 

&quot;Not really, I&#39;m busy.&quot; Zelda mumbled. 

She was busy? From what Samus could see, all she was doing was scowling 
at the table top.  

&quot;You&#39;re just lying there,&quot; Samus paused, waiting for the obvious truth 
of her statement of sink in, but Zelda remained quiet. &quot;And besides we 
always watch it... Well we used to...&quot; 

&quot;I just don&#39;t feel like it right now.&quot;  

&quot;Oh... well... you want to go train instead...?&quot; she paused again, 
waiting for a response, but got none. &quot;Or we could go to the commons for 
something to eat,&quot; she said, another paused. &quot;How about we--&quot; 

&quot;I have something I need to do,&quot; Zelda said, cutting her off and with a 
hint of irritation in her voice. She stood and left without another 
word. 

&quot;What- ...ok. I&#39;ll see you later... ugh...&quot; she groaned that last part 
to herself as Zelda exited.  

------ 

Samus went to the commons anyway to get something to eat. There she saw 
Peach sitting at a table and talking with Marth. She was blushing 
slightly and batting her eyes at him like a little kid with a crush. 
Peach flipped her hair then took a strand of it between her fingers, 
twirling it around.  

&quot;Tch, could she be more obvious?&quot; Samus muttered to herself.   

She hated Peach, God, did she hate Peach! &quot;The other princess&quot;, as Samus 
often thought of her, just rubbed the bounty hunter the wrong way on 
every imaginable level. Originally she hadn&#39;t distinguished between 
Peach and Zelda. They were just &quot;the princesses&quot;, and there was not a 
difference between them.  

She was glad she was wrong about Zelda.  

The two couldn&#39;t be more different. Peach could be so immature at times; 
prone to bouts of silliness, and if someone crossed her, her vengeance 
often came in the form of childish pranks. While Zelda, on the other 
hand, was one of the most mature people Samus had ever met. Wise and 
insightful, Zelda was often reminiscent of Samus&#39; adoptive Chozo 
parents. 

Peach was girly, not feminine; too pink, too frilly to be taken 
seriously. Her sickeningly sweet laugh was something that Samus found 
particularly grating. She was loud and boisterous, as where Zelda was 
soft spoken and reserved. She was too haughty about being royalty also, 
frequently taking the opportunity to remind everyone she encountered 
that she was a princess. Zelda on the other hand was modest about the 
fact. Only when the two were together did Zelda act at all &#39;princessy&#39;, 
and Samus especially hated Peach for that. 

While Samus and Zelda did things together and hung out from time to 
time, Peach was really her best friend. There were things that Zelda 
would only do with Peach, and only talk to her about. Zelda would never 
let Samus in on the private little conversations they had, something the 
two of them referred to &quot;girl talk&quot; in the presence of any guys. Samus 
had no idea why they wouldn&#39;t allow her in or what they talked about, 
but it did seem like they were having plenty of fun. The conversations 
always involved plenty of whispering, giggling, and embarrassed looks.  

She could recall countless occurrences in the room they all stayed in 
where the two of them would stay up late, talking; but always too 
quietly for her to hear from her bed. And they&#39;d instantly shut up or 
change the subject whenever she tried to involve herself in the 
conversation. Or she&#39;d catch a self-conscious look on Zelda&#39;s face 
whenever she&#39;d walk in on such a conversation. It was as if she wasn&#39;t 
worthy of being included or confided in. She and Zelda didn&#39;t really 
ever talk about anything serious at all; she simply wasn&#39;t the close 
friend that Peach was. That jealousy of only fueled her existing hatred 
of Peach. 

Another thing Samus hated about her was the fact that Peach, merely by 
acting silly and cute, got so much attention from the men, just like she 
was from Marth right now. Not that she was interested in Marth in the 
least, or any of the losers that Peach had wrapped around her little 
finger; she just couldn&#39;t stand that they would fawn over her like 
complete idiots despite her obvious shortcomings, obvious to Samus at 
least.  

Thankfully, Zelda was above all that. Samus had never before seen her 
behave so brainless around a guy. She was decent, respectable, and far 
too intelligent to lower herself to such a level. 

That wasn&#39;t the way a woman should behave as far as Samus was concerned. 
There weren&#39;t many females here, and she felt that Peach all too often 
acted as a very poor representative for her gender. She only hoped some 
of the guys were smart enough to see her for what she was, and to know 
that Zelda was by far the better example. On that note Samus certainly 
hoped no one looked to her as an instance of womanhood. Though she was 
sure no one did; she was a bounty hunter first and foremost. Of all the 
things she was an example of, woman was far from the top of that list 

Samus watched them a while longer. Because he was busy staring at Peach 
instead of looking at his drink, Marth spilled it as he went to pick it 
up. Samus rolled her eyes at the ensuing commotion; no one would ever 
look at someone like her that way.  

She huffed and folded her arms. &quot;Humph... Like I care...&quot; 

Peach and Zelda were best friends however, which meant she was probably 
the best person to turn to for help with anything regarding Zelda. 
Despite her loathing for the woman, Samus resolved to stomach the 
sickening display until Marth finally left. Attempting to push aside her 
disdain of  Mushroom Kingdom&#39;s princess, she went and sat down at the 
same table as her. 

Peach stared at her stupefied as she pulled up a chair, she knew Samus 
hated her guts. They were both silent, each waiting for the other to 
speak first. 

When it became obvious it wasn&#39;t going to happen, Peach blurted out, 
&quot;Why hello there, miss super bounty hunter. What is it I can do for 
you?&quot; 

Samus groaned, loathing that sickeningly cheerful attitude. Though she 
wasn&#39;t sure how, she just knew she was being mocked from behind that 
sweet facade. 

&quot;Zelda&#39;s upset,&quot; she stated bluntly. 

&quot;Ya&#39;, I know...&quot; 

&quot;Well... then... fix it,&quot; Samus fumbled her request, completely 
unaccustomed to asking for help. 

Peach mad a face that Samus could only assume was a mock appalled 
expression. &quot;Now, now, Samus dear, we must mind our manners. You 
shouldn&#39;t speak to me in such a curt manner.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll speak however I want.&quot; 

&quot;We princesses are delicate creatures, you know.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah right. Screw you.&quot; Samus spat. 

Peach started giggling at that and had to fight to keep composed. &quot;Well 
I&#39;m sure you&#39;d love to, but I do have my standards.&quot; 

Samus made tightly clenched fists under the table, trying with all her 
being to resist yelling. &quot;Ugg... Look, I don&#39;t want to argue with you 
now, just help Zelda already. She&#39;s really depressed lately.&quot; 

Peach let out a deflated sigh. &quot;You know... You&#39;re more suited to help 
Zelda with her problems than anyone.&quot; 

&quot;What? Me? Why?&quot; 

Peach rolled her eyes, &quot;Are you honestly that oblivious?&quot; 

&#39;What&#39;s that supposed to mean,&#39; Samus thought, shaking her head. &quot;Come 
on, you know how to talk to people better than I do, and besides aren&#39;t 
you&#39;re like her best friend? Except maybe Link, there&#39;s no one she trust 
more than you.&quot;  

Peach put her palm to her forehead head and let out an exacerbated sigh. 
&quot;Oh... Silly, silly, oblivious girl. Silly Sammy, that&#39;s what we should 
call you; who can&#39;t see the forest because of the trees.&quot; 

Samus clenched her teeth trying to ignore the insult. She needed Peach&#39;s 
help, and it wouldn&#39;t help to start a fight, though she was quickly 
running short on patients. 

Peach continued. &quot;Hmm... maybe you can only understand something if you 
are able to scan it. Have you tried scanning Zelda?&quot; 

&quot;Do you at least know what&#39;s bothering her?&quot; Samus said through her 
teeth. 

&quot;Yes, I do, actually. But why don&#39;t you try asking her that yourself?&quot; 

&quot;Because you&#39;re here right now and I&#39;m asking you!&quot; 

Peach sighed, shaking her head. &quot;You&#39;re such an idiot.&quot;  

That was all of Peach Samus could handle for one day. &quot;Yeah well....!&quot; 
Samus stood suddenly, knocking her chair over, &quot;You&#39;re a bitch!&quot; she 
shouted before storming off in a huff, grumbling something incoherent. 
That princess had no idea how close she was treading to getting a boot 
in her ridiculous round little face. 

Peach shook her head sadly as the huntress left. &quot;Honestly, what does 
she see in that Amazon?&quot;
