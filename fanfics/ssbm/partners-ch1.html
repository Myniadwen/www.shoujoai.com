<h1>Partners (part 1 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ssbm/index.html">Super Smash Brothers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dak.html">Dak</a><br> </h2>
<pre>First off, I changed the characters around a little. Samus cannot go 
around without a beamsword. I also apologize if I state anything 
incorrectly. I know enough to write this fanfic, and maybe a little 
more, about these characters. Also note that this is more in the way of 
an action/fighting fanfic, not too much romance. There is some romance, 
but not as much as others I&#39;ve seen. Without further ado ( I hate that 
phrase) let&#39;s start this fanfic.

By the way, even though this is not a lemon, there might be some 
certainly suggestive things.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

An entire chunk of wall collapsed to the ground as Ridley slashed it 
with his tail, missing the agile Samus. He turned again towards her and 
screeched. Samus had a charged shot in her gun, and pointed at Ridley, 
who flew full speed at her. She let loose with the cannon, striking 
Ridley, and morphed to ball mode to roll right under him as he flew 
past. He stopped and whipped around slashing his tail again. Samus 
reformed with barely enough time to leap over the deadly tail. She 
activated her missle gun and took aim, as Ridley came charging yet 
again. She fired three shot, all which missed Ridley when he barrel 
rolled and slammed headfirst into Samus. About to be slammed into a 
wall, Samus fired her grappling beam at... something, hoping to latch 
on.

Yes...

She she caught an odd shape hanging from the cieling... and she pulled 
herself away from Ridley, just as he went headfirst into the wall. 
Suddenly the rock gave way, and Samus began falling to the ground. 
Ridley pulled his head from the wall, shook the dizziness out, and 
screeched again. Samus landed on her two feet perfectly. She whipped out 
her missles again... and fired.... Nothing.

She was out of ammo, and her charged shots would take to long. She 
activated her beamsword, ready to strike at Ridley. He turned towards 
her again, and hissed something Samus could only guess meant &quot;this time, 
you&#39;re DEAD!&quot;

He came flying at her full speed,(yet again) and Samus braced herself.

&quot;...aaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!&quot;

An object fell on Ridley&#39;s head, knocking him out, and sending him 
sliding to Samus&#39;s feet.

Samus looked at the unconscious Ridley, and then up, to look at the 
object... the girl curled up on ridley&#39;s back, shaking. Samus took first 
priority into hand. She charged up a shot as far as it would go, opened 
ridley&#39;s huge mouth, and fired a shot directly into his throat. Blood 
splattered as his insides ripped apart. Then, letting his massive jaw 
slam down, she climbed up his head and to the girl. She observed the 
girl using her scan visor, and after confirming that she was okay, only 
in slight shock, she knelt down next to her.

&quot;Excuse me, are you alright there?&quot; She asked. The girl took a moment to 
look up at Samus. She was shivering madly. Samus had never seen a 
humanoid like this. She looked perfectly normal, human face, human 
hands, long blond human hair. However, her ears pointed out farther than 
Samus had ever seen.

From the girl&#39;s point of view, it was slightly different. She had just 
fallen, god-knows-how-many-feet, landed on a monster larger than any in 
her land, and was now being observed by a large, orange, metallic, 
humanish thing with shoulders the size of beach balls. (well, maybe not 
THAT big).

&quot;I said are you alright?&quot; Samus asked again.

&quot;I... I think so...&quot; replied the girl.

&quot;Your status shows &#39;unharmed&#39;, and you only seem to be in shock. you 
think you can stand?&quot; asked Samus.

&quot;I...&quot; she replied. If this thing, obviously female, was honest, she 
should have no trouble standing, but she felt weary.

&quot;I&#39;ll help you up.&quot; Samus offered. She put her arm around the girl&#39;s 
waist. She gasped and blushed ( the girl) and was lifted to her feet. 
The female in the metal was very strong.

&quot;My name&#39;s Samus.&quot; She said, taking off her helmet to show she was 
human.

&quot;Oh...&quot; was all the girl replied. Samus&#39;s face shrank with irritation.

&quot;I was hoping to get your name by saying that.&quot;

&quot;Oh oh I&#39;m terribly sorry, I&#39;m being rude.&quot; she finally said

Tell me about it. thought Samus.

&quot;My name is Zelda, pleased to meet you.&quot; Zelda said.

&quot;Good good. How did you get here anyway?&quot; Samus asked.

&quot;I fell.&quot; Zelda replied.

Oh great. Samus thought to herself.

&quot;How exactly did you fall?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s see, I was returning to the castle...&quot;

Oh great, royalty.

&quot;... and I encountered some monsters. I tried to use my magic to get rid 
of them, but somethign happened and I found myself standing on a 
completely different land.&quot;

She&#39;s from another world, but I don&#39;t recognize her species.

&quot;How did you get all the way down here? I mean there are countless 
numbers of enemies on the descent down here.&quot;

&quot;I tripped and fell, and the ground gave way. Next I knew, I was falling 
for a few minutes.&quot;

Samus looked up and around to where she had fallen from. All she could 
see was a hole, one that had formed when the rock hold collapsed.

&quot;...fell through that hole and landed here.&quot; Zelda was obviously feeling 
a lot more comfortable, now that she was yammering on.

&quot;Well, I have a little more business to take care of down here, but then 
I can take you to my ship, and get you...&quot;

&quot;You have a boat? But I haven&#39;t seen any water to sail on.&quot;

&quot;Not that kind of ship. When are you from, the middle ages? Anyway, you 
can wait here for me to return and get you, or if you can pull your 
weight in a battle, you can come along and help.&quot;

Suddenly the surface under them shifted. Thay forgot that they were 
standing on Ridley. They both jump off and whirled around to see the 
bleeding monster get to his feet.

&quot;Oh shiiiiiit!&quot; whined Samus, activating her beamsword. Behind her Zelda 
began gathering her magic but on this planet the sages were hard to 
reach.

&quot;What in the universe is THAT!?&quot; Samus yelled.

&quot;Magic!&quot; Zelda replied, &quot;Just give me a moment.&quot;

Yeah, I can give you a pet metroid while I&#39;m at it.

Ridley screeched again, shaking the entire room. Samus lunged at Ridley 
and buried her blade into his chest. He grabbed at her, but she jumped 
away just in time. She laned on the floor and leaped again as Ridley 
slammed his claw to the ground.

I did some real damage to him last shot, he&#39;s moving a lot slower.

Then came the tail. Samus used a midair bounce with the bomb, doing 
double duty of damaging and dodging. Suddenly Ridley turned to Zelda, 
noticing the growing magic.

&quot;No you DON&#39;T!&quot; Samus yelled and rolled under him to get in front of 
Zelda. The tail came again.

Oh no.

Samus was sent flying into a pile of rubble, and caused the wall to 
collapse even more. Ridley roared and came down with his mouth open.

A shining light appeared from Zelda&#39;s hands and stopped Ridley a foot 
away from her. Ridley was then lifted up into the air. Struggling, he 
hissed again.

&quot;You are too late Samus, the mother brain is gone from this world, and 
you will never make it out alive!&quot; With that, he exploded, vaporized.

Zelda ran to Samus, lying under all the rubble. She pulled off rock 
after rock, trying to get to Samus. After about five farely sizeable 
rocks, she began to hear cursing, and sparking, and shrieks of pain. 
Zelda pulled off another rock so she could see Samus.

&quot;Samus, are you alright?&quot;

&quot;Help me get out of here! Ridley&#39;s cursed me again!&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; was Zelda&#39;s reply. And then....

&quot;WARNING. WARNING. WARNING. SELF DUSTRUCT SEQUENCE ACTIVATED. REMAINING 
TIME BEFORE DESTRUCTION, 5 MINUTES.&quot;

A red light began flashing throughout the entire complex.

&quot;Why me, why always me.&quot; Samus screamed. She pushed off the remaining 
with her natural strength. She stood up and observed her suit, as did 
Zelda.

The suit was broken in fifty places, and most of her equipment was not 
operating. The gyro, the shielding, the fancy weapons, and her signature 
mark, the shoulderpads, were all broken.

&quot;That warning didn&#39;t sound to good. I assume we should run?&quot; Zelda asked 
sarcastically.

&quot;You&#39;ll need to do a lot more than run my friend.&quot;

The two of them took off running, out the way Samus originally came. 
They would be unable to use the hole that Zelda fell through, it was too 
high to reach, and Samus&#39;s space jump was also damaged. Then she 
realized her dash boots were still operable.

&quot;Zelda?&quot; Samus yelled, panting.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Jump into my arms.&quot;

&quot;WHAT!?&quot;

&quot;Just do it!&quot;

Zelda ran and jumped to Samus, who caught her. Then she began glowing, 
and took off running at incredible speeds through the caverns. Jump afer 
turn after drop after more jumping, they began nearing the top. They 
came to a verticle room.

&quot;I think I can take you up this.&quot; Samus said. Suddenly the roomn shifted 
and began tilting. Samus crouched to jump, and her ankle made a small 
explosion

That would be my Jump boots.

Still, she jumped up to the platform. Then to the next. Zelda hung 
tight. Above them, they heard chunks of rock start falling. Samus jumped 
to the next platform to avoid a rock. Then she saw a larger rock falling 
onto them, with no way to dodge. Zelda cried out aggressively and 
blasted the rock to dust.

&quot;That was cool.&quot; Samus said.

&#39;WARNING. WARNING. WARNING. 1 MINUTE TILL DESTRUCTION!&quot;

WHAT!? There&#39;s no time to get up that fast. Stupid girl, holding me 
back.

Samus jumped again, dodging more rocks, still nowhere near the top, let 
alone the halfway point. Zelda closed her eyes and put her palms on 
Samus&#39;s shoulders. With a green flash Samus found they were only three 
jumps to the top.

I take it all back.

&quot;You just keep pulling out new tricks don&#39;t you?&quot; Samus commented, 
jumping to the top. She blasted the doors open and ran out. Then she 
noticed her speed boots had been damaged by the last explosion. She put 
Zelda down and the two of them ran to the other end of the room...

Only to find one of the hated grey doors. No matter how much Samus could 
blast at it, it would never open.

&quot;You got any tricks for this?&quot;

&quot;I do in fact.&quot; Zelda replied. Samus threw up her arms with a heavy 
sigh/groan. Zelda began concentrating on the door. Samus figured they 
had about 15 seconds left. She whirled around to tell Zelda to speed it 
up. Zelda lifted her hands with a groan, and the door forced open. Samus 
stood there, fist clenched, mouth open in surprise, before she realized 
that now they had ten seconds remaining. The two of them ran through the 
door, and out into rain.

&quot;You where saying about no water?&quot; Samus remarked.

&quot;Shut up.&quot; 

There was Samus&#39;s ship. Samus jumped up first and fell through the open 
hatch, landing in the control seat. She initiated launch sequence before 
anything else. Zelda fell through the hatch, and Samus closed it. As 
they took off, the ground below the ship began cracking with red lines. 
Samus forced the ship into overdrive.

A bright light appeared where there used to be a planet, as it exploded 
into nothing. Floating debris around the planet vaporized as they 
entered the blast zone. A lone ship flew away at hundreds of miles per 
hour.

Inside the ship, Samus slumped down in the chair, she gave a massive 
sigh/groan at her exhaustion.

&quot;You look tired.&quot; Zelda exclaimed, slumping into her own chair.

&quot;I don&#39;t usually have to save someone else&#39;s skin. Usually it&#39;s just me 
and the force of evil.&quot; Samus replied, to tired to make a sarcastic 
remark. 

Finally, Samus stood up and went to another room in her ship. Zelda soon 
heard klinking and yelps of pain. She went in to investigate, and found 
Samus yanking off parts of her battered suit. Under her suit she had on 
a two piece outfit. Somewhat like a bikini. Zelda blushed seeing Samus 
in those clothes. Then she noticed Samus struggling to pull off the 
legpieces that had busted. Zelda built up some courage and walked in. 
She grabbed the legpiece. She blushed a little more. She and Samus 
finally yanked off the piece. Zelda noticed that Samus wasn&#39;t blushing 
at all. She had next to no emotion on her face, except for irritation, 
of course. Samus got the last piece off herself.

&quot;Eh-hem!&quot; Samus cleared her throat, glaring at Zelda.

&quot;Oh, yes, sorry.&quot; She apologized as she backed out of the room, the door 
shut automatically. Zelda sat back down into the chair, and stared out 
at the stars.

Samus found a change of undergarments and put those on. Then she looked 
for some normal clothes.

What&#39;s with that girl anyway. She&#39;s been wierd ever since I found her 
down there. And the way she kept blushing at me. It seems almost like...

Samus shook her head and told herself no.

She can&#39;t be attracted to me. I&#39;m no beauty contestant. I&#39;m not ugly, 
but I&#39;m certainly not something to... Oh shut up Samus. She&#39;s just an 
annoying royal brat.

A brat with cool abilities.

Samus found Zelda cuddled up in the chair, sleeping peacefully.

I guess she is comfortable out here too. It&#39;s nice to look at the stars 
when you&#39;re lonely.

Samus picked Zelda up into her arms. Zelda sighed, and wrapped her arms 
around Samus&#39;s neck and shoulders.

Oh great. I think she IS a lesbian.

Samus brought her to a small room, flipped the bed up, and set her down. 
She had to slide her head out of Zelda&#39;s arms to get away. She grabbed a 
soft blanket and put it over Zelda, tucking her in. Zelda sighed again, 
and snuggled in. Samus couldn&#39;t help but smile at that, before walking 
away and closing the door.

Zelda opened her eyes a little, smiling.

She&#39;s so caring. She just acts like a tough macho, but inside she is 
just the same as a Hylian.

Samus entered the control room again, and sat down at her chair. She was 
tired, but she had to track down the mother brain... AGAIN.

How many times has it been? I&#39;ve destroyed you at least 5 times already. 
The stupid pirates just keep reviving you... AND Ridley. Just watch 
Samus, next time you see that bastard he&#39;ll be decked out like a cyborg.

Samus began typing away at her computer, searching for any clues she 
might get. She noticed that she had an e-mail. (yes Samus has e-mail in 
this one) She opened it up and read an invitation to a tournament of 
heroes from all around the galaxy.

&quot;Oh brother. One of these again.&quot; Samus grumbled. She had gone to 
numerous ones in the past, all were the same. Fight fight fight, and 
probaby lose to that Jigglypuff with the pretty pink flower. Despite the 
fact that Samus was one of the best bounty hunters in the galaxy, and 
Jigglypuff was a puffball that weighed as much as a pillow, with hardly 
any good abilities, it was extremely skilled, and kept beating Samus.

I swear, there is no other Poke&#39;mon like it. I&#39;m not sure anymore if it 
even IS a poke&#39;mon.

Suddenly Samus remembered something. There was a fighter who had similar 
ears to Zelda&#39;s. Aside from wanting to try her luck again against 
Jigglypuff, she wanted to meet with the warrior and confirm a relation 
of some sort. Unfortunately, the tournament was weeks away. Fortunately, 
it would give her some time to track down the Mother Brain, and finally 
destroy it. If that happened soon enough, she could have extra time to 
train. This was all assuming that she could find Mother Brain before the 
tournament.

The computer started beeping and whirring, announcing that they were 
approaching a station. Samus looked up to see a space station called 
Hydra. It was a relatively new station, being constructed before Samus 
landed to hunt the Mother Brain.

&quot;This is space station Hydra. Requesting identification of approaching 
ship.&quot;

&quot;You idiot, that&#39;s Samus&#39;s ship.&quot; another voice was heard from behind 
the first.

&quot;Space station Hydra, this is Samus Aran, requesting permission to 
dock.&quot;

There was silence on the air for a few seconds. Then...

&quot;Samus Aran, you have clearance to dock in bay 35. Fly under the station 
and enter the door with the flashing light.&quot;

Samus flew her ship to the underside of the station. Sure enough, there 
was a flahing light next to an opening bay door. She brought her ship up 
into the docking bay, and the door closed behind her.

&quot;I&#39;m in place Control. lock me in.&quot;

Two mechanical arms held onto Samus&#39;s ship, and a magnetic field was 
generated to hold the ship.

&quot;Samus Aran your ship is locked in place. Please hold a moment.&quot;

A whirring sound occured, signalling the access tube was being locked 
in, follwed by a hissing sound as the air was released into the tube.

&quot;Samus Aran, we have secured access to your ship and you are ready to 
disembark. Welcome aboard the Hydra.&quot; With a thanks from Samus, the 
transmission was cut, and Samus got up from her chair. She almost fell 
over from dizziness.

&quot;I guess I&#39;m really tired. I did a lot of work today.&quot; She stretched and 
walked to Zelda&#39;s room.

Zelda was still sleeping peacefully. Samus smiled a bit and decided 
against waking her up, and left again.

Samus climbed the ladder out of her ship, and entered the hallway tube 
to the station. She carried with her a large case, full of her broken 
suit pieces. The door opened and she looked into the station. Parts of 
it were still being worked on, as she could see multiple workers, with 
ladders, tools, warning ribbons, and other such stuff. She had two ways 
to go, left or right. It was a fairly new space station model, so she 
was a bit confused about the design. She looked for a map, and looked 
for a repair center, and a control room. She headed first for the repair 
center and dropped her suit off for repair and upgrades, along with some 
cash to pay for.

Zelda finally woke up after a while. She yawned and stretched and sat 
up. Then she noticed the ship wasn&#39;t moving. She stood up and walked out 
of the room, into the front of the ship. She looked around, and saw 
metal structures outside the ship. Then she noticed the metal arms, 
which had moved away from the ship. Zelda became very nervous. She had 
no clue where she was, and Samus was not on the ship. She heard 
footsteps from above the ship, coming from the opening in the top of the 
ship. She heard talking soon after, as the footsteps grew louder. She 
ran and hid under the control console. She heard a different pattern of 
footsteps, still getting louder, with clinking of metal. She saw three 
men step into the ship. Two of them where the size of Ganon, but the 
third was smaller. He seemed to be in charge of the other two.

&quot;Samus said that there was a girl in her ship, and she was sleeping, so 
try not to disturb her.&quot; The smaller one said.

&quot;I&#39;m getting bad thoughts John.&quot; Said one of the bigger ones.

&quot;Well don&#39;t let them be any more than thoughts buddy.&quot; John ordered, &quot;In 
fact, get it off your mind, if the girl is hurt, you know what Samus&#39;ll 
do to us.&quot;

&quot;Right!&quot; the two largers replied.

&quot;Now let&#39;s get to work on the ship boys.&quot; John and the other two were 
appearantly repairmen or cleaners or something. Still, Zelda was a bit 
frightened, and stayed where she was.

A set of two large feet stopped next to where she hid.

&quot;Samus is gonna fight in the tournament again?&quot; She heard him say.

Where was Samus now? She wondered. She held still and tried not to make 
a noise.

&quot;Hey Bruce. She&#39;s not in here.&quot; The other large man said from Zelda&#39;s 
room.

Bruce turned around and walked to her room.

&quot;What? I though Samus said...&quot;

Zelda hopped out from under the console and ran to the ladder. John 
walked out of Samus&#39;s room and saw her.

&quot;Hey guys, she&#39;s here, and she is quite awake.&quot;

Zelda panicked and blasted him with a magic bolt. John yelped and flew 
back into Bruce and the other guy. Zelda immediately rushed up the 
ladder...

.. and into Samus&#39;s arms. There Zelda whimpered, as Samus held her to 
keep her from falling.

&quot;What in the universe is wrong princess?&quot; Samus asked. Zelda just clung 
to Samus, her fear blocking out all reason. John climbed up the ladder 
and looked up at Samus.

&quot;There you are. I...&quot;

&quot;What happened!?&quot; Samus demanded.

&quot;Woah woah, hold it,&quot; John said, holding his hands up in a surrendering 
pose. &quot;We didn&#39;t find her in her room like you said. She was in the 
control room... appearantly hiding under the consol from the dust that I 
see. She burst out and blasted me.&quot;

&quot;Okay...&quot; Samus sighed. She kneeled down to let Zelda down to the floor. 
She looked up and mumbled, and then held Zelda, calmy telling her it was 
alright. Then she heard Zelda mumbling something.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Samus asked.

&quot;...want to...home.&quot; Zelda cried. &quot;I want to go home. I want to go home&quot;

Samus looked at Zelda, then held her again. It was understandable for 
her fear. She had been attacked, her technique had gone awry and zapped 
her onto a mysterious planet, where she fell seemingly to her doom, onto 
a monsters back, who came back to life to attack... yadda yadda, you get 
the idea.

John just stood there staring, until Samus looked up and glared at him. 
He freaked and jumped back into the ship to continue his maintenance 
work.

After getting Zelda to a medical center to check her condition, Samus 
took her to a cafe.

&quot;Anything that you want to eat, you can have it, it&#39;s on me. Besides you 
don&#39;t have any money, with the exception to your claiming those crystal 
things as money.&quot;

&quot;Rupees Samus, they&#39;re rupees.&quot;

&quot;Whatever. What do you want, you must be starving.&quot;

Zelda looked at the numerous counters with food galore. She saw meats of 
all kinds, fruits and veggies, breads, and multiple concoctions she had 
never seen before. After the two of them grabbed some food, Samus with 
considerable more than Zelda, they payed and went to a table.

&quot;So what&#39;s your story princess?&quot; Samus questioned.

&quot;Where do you want me to start?&quot;

&quot;Anywhere, I&#39;m interested, especially how you do those cool tricks. I 
don&#39;t see any machinery on you, nor did the medical center confirm you 
to be an android or cyborg.&quot;

&quot;A what?&quot;

&quot;A cyborg. Half living, half machine. Android. AI with an entirely 
mechanical body.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m still uncertain of what these &#39;machines&#39; are.&quot; Zelda questioned.

&quot;Okay okay...&quot; Samus closed her eyes and put her hands to her forhead.

&quot;My suit... that&#39;s a machine. My ship... that&#39;s a machine too. It&#39;s a 
noneliving thing that performs tasks that humans can&#39;t do. Such as space 
travel or energy charging, even reduction of damage. But you don&#39;t have 
any machines in any relation to you, how can you do all that stuff?&quot;

&quot;I told you before, magic.&quot;

Samus stared at Zelda for a moment, then burst out laughing, rolling 
around on the floor, causing a spectacle. Zelda blushed, not of 
attraction, but embarressment. Samus finally regained control of herself 
and sat back up, still giggling.

&quot;Magic, haha. That&#39;s a good one. Oh I get it, you must be related to 
Sabrina. You&#39;re the crazy aunt?&quot;

Zelda looked confused.

&quot;Sabrina? Who&#39;s Sabrina.&quot;

&quot;Sabrina, that crazy TV... show... Oh yeah. That&#39;s a machine. Never 
mind.&quot;

Zelda looked at Samus, confused, then giggled a bit.

&quot;Okay miss magic, how did you get this ability?&quot;

&quot;I was... born with it. People who use magic rarely learn it in life, 
they are usually born with it, or granted it.&quot;

Samus just stared, with an expression similar to an irritated Tron 
Bonne.

&quot;See look.&quot; Zelda said. She reached a hand out to Samus&#39;s food and 
levatated it. Now Samus stared in shock.

&quot;Wha... How?&quot;

Zelda smiled and giggled a bit more. Then she set down the food and ate 
her own.

&quot;I am a princess, as you guessed correctly. But don&#39;t worry about me, 
I&#39;m not a snotty, rude, or selfish royal. My father was a bit like that. 
Don&#39;t get me wrong, he was nice and cared for me, and his people, but he 
was a little foolish. I told him that Ganon was going to betray us, but 
he didn&#39;t listen.&quot;

&quot;Ganon is your resident badguy I take it?&quot; Samus asked.

&quot;That&#39;s, one way to put it, yes. Anyway, a whole bunch of destiny stuff 
happens with a Hero of Time and me, the Princess of Destiny.&quot;

&quot;So did you and this Hero of Time get together?&quot;

&quot;Yes, we joined our power and defeated Ganon.&quot;

Samus slapped her forehead.

&quot;No silly, I figured that part, but did you and the Hero... you know... 
like each other&quot; Samus asked, &quot;I am not asking about if you and he had 
sex, just so you know. That kind of talk bores me.&quot;

&quot;Oh heavens no. He may be strong and valiant, and a wonderful fighter 
and protector, but he&#39;s... kind of an airhead. I suppose it would seem 
destiny for us to join in love, but no, I was never interested.&quot;

&quot;So what happened?&quot;

&quot;I sent him back to his own time.&quot;

&quot;With your magic right?&quot;

Zelda nodded. Then continued eating. Their food was getting cold.

&quot;Sir, I think we may have a problem.&quot; Said a man sitting at a scanning 
control console.

&quot;What is it?&quot; asked the man in charge.

&quot;Pirates, a lot of them sir.&quot;

&quot;Damn. Get Samus up here. While you&#39;re at it, get all your fighters 
ready to launch and repel.&quot;

Men and women went to work frantically to get things in order to repel 
the pirate attack.

&quot;SAMUS ARAN. PLEASE REPORT TO THE CONTROL ROOM A-S-A-P!&quot; 

&quot;What did I do now?&quot; Samus moaned. She stood up and cleared her tray in 
the trash and dashed towards the control room. Zelda rushed to keep up. 
The two of them ran through a stampede of people suited up in pilot 
outfits.

Samus and Zelda reached the control room and Samus ran to the commander.

&quot;Sir, what&#39;s happening?&quot; She asked.

&quot;Scanners have just picked up a full invasion squad of pirates heading 
this way.&quot;

&quot;How many?&quot;

&quot;There are 32 ships sir.&quot;

&quot;That means they have 96 soldiers ready to invade our station. We are 
NOT going to let them take us. We&#39;ve barely got the station completed. 
Activate automated defenses. When the fighters get out of the station 
lock the bay doors, we can&#39;t let anything in.&quot;

The commander turned to Samus.

&quot;Suit up, if any pirates get in, I want you to take them out as soon as 
possible.&quot;

Samus nodded. The commander looked past Samus at Zelda.

&quot;Can your friend fight?&quot;

&quot;Somewhat sir.&quot;

Zelda just stood back and listened.

Pirates? She thought. How did pirates get here. I thought they were 
confined to the seas.

&quot;...fight?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Zelda replied.

&quot;Can you fight?&quot; Samus asked again. &quot;These are pirates different from 
the ones you have probably seen. They have machines to help them, and 
they are deadly. They probably won&#39;t take you prisoner, instead they&#39;ll 
probably just kill you.&quot;

&quot;I... yes. I can fight.&quot; Zelda&#39;s mind was screaming at her for that 
answer. What was she thinking. She didn&#39;t know anything about these 
pirates, and she was about to risk her life against any number of them.

Samus turned back to the commander, who was making a speech to the 
fighter pilots as they launched. He put down the mic and turned back to 
Samus, who nodded in confirmation.

&quot;Your suit should be mostly repaired, get it quickly.&quot; He commanded. 
With that, Samus dashed off to the repair center. The commander faced 
Zelda and approached her.

&quot;You will need some armor as well.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; was all Zelda replied.

&quot;What do you mean my weapons are useless!?&quot; Samus screamed at the 
repairman.

&quot;Well, all except for your blade and blaster, I didn&#39;t have enough time 
to repair them. You&#39;r suit is repaired though.&quot;

&quot;Upgrades?&quot;

The repairman shook his head. Samus growled, and put on her armor 
anyway. The loudspeaker came on and the commander&#39;s voice was heard.

&quot;ANYONE IN THE STATION WHO CAN FIGHT, PREPARE YOURSELVES. GET NON 
FIGHTERS TO SAFEZONES. TAKE POSITIONS NEAR THE GATES.&quot;

As Samus stared out into the halls, she saw a lot of civilian types, and 
very few fighters.

Suddenly the station rumbled as the defense systems began firing. Samus 
threw on her helmet and buckled it, then ran into the halls to the 
nearest bay gate.

I hope Zelda will be alright. She worried.

Outside the station space fighting was raging on between fighters and 
pirates. The pirates continued racing past, with only a few ships behind 
to combat the fighters. The pirates hammered away at the bay doors with 
their cannons. Fighters retreated the main fight to take out the 
entering pirates, but they were shot down, either by those from behind, 
or the ones they were about to attack. An explosion erupted from the 
underside of the station, and every single pirate ship in the area, main 
battle or invasion team, flew full speed towards the opening.

Samus cursed repeatedly as she was not able to charge a shot. The 
station rumbled again as the pirates began busting down the gates.

Here goes.

A final explosion brought down the gate in her section. Then another 
explosion in another section. She looked forward to see 9 pirates of 
different color and size jumped out and attacked. There were three 
people assisting her. The first pirate came barreling towards her firing 
his arm cannon rapidly. She fell to enter ball mode, and found that it 
had not been repaired either, as she was hit about seven times and 
knocked back.

The pirate jumped on top of her, staring down at her through his space 
mask.

&quot;The infamous Samus Aran, brought down by a measly pirate like me?&quot; He 
laughed evily, and raised his sword to strike. Samus kicked her legs up 
and grabbed him from behind, wrapped her legs around him. She then threw 
him to the ground and jumped up. As she landed she drove the sword into 
his chest. He squirmed and shrieked, until finally stopping altogether. 
She looked up, just in time to see two missles streaking towards her. 
She fell to the ground, firing her gun. Three pirates came charging at 
her one whos armor was damaged as he had ben hit by her shots. She 
jumped to her feet and deflected the first pirate&#39;s sword. Then jumping 
over the second pirate she cut the third down the middle. She whirled 
around and peppered the area behind her. The first pirate was hit 
directly in the head and collapsed. The second fired a rocket at her. 
Samus ducked under the rocket, only to see him fire a second to the 
ground. She leapt up and fired down at him, striking his armor in 
multiple spots. He was about to fire another rocket at her when another 
pirate went flying into him. Samus landed and looked to the side. A big 
burly man gave her the thumbs up, and she replied. The fighters remained 
in the area for a moment to make sure no more pirates would appear from 
this section, and then moved on.

Zelda wasn&#39;t quite used to the armor, and wasn&#39;t quite as agile as she 
normally was. But she would have died about twice if she wasn&#39;t wearing 
it. The suit now had a large slash mark, and a big blast mark on it. She 
now faced a large pirate with a large blade. He wasn&#39;t too fast, but 
Zelda couldn&#39;t find him. He had a cloaking device activated. The other 
fighters in the section had been killed and she was all that was left 
defending this gate. Three smaller pirates stood around her confused at 
how she made a pirate explode just by lifting her hand. The first of the 
three made a stand and charged at her firing his gun. Zelda formed a 
reflective barrier and bounced away all the shots. The pirate jumped and 
slashed down with his sword. Zelda broke her barrier and formed it into 
a magical blade ring, and sliced through the pirate. She looked at the 
other two and...

A blur in the air! She ducked and avoided the big pirate&#39;s sword just 
barely. She rolled away and launched a couple blasts of light. A large 
figure flashed out of thin air and then dissapeared. The other two 
pirates took this opportunity to run in and attack. Both firing their 
guns they came charging in just as the first had. Zelda turned in time 
to leap to the side of one of the pirates. She grabbed his arm and 
whirled around, throwing him into his friend. Zelda looked back to them 
and sent another one of her fireballs at them. Their suits went critical 
and they exploded. Zelda stood and concentrated on the big one&#39;s 
position.

Behind.

She teleported away in time to avoid the big sword, and began gathering 
her magic to attack him. A tall man in dark clothes and silver hair, 
wielding a long blade ran into the section.

&quot;Why are you still here? There are no pirates&quot; With that, the big pirate 
ran him through. Zelda took the opportunity and unleashed all the energy 
that she had gathered. The cloaking device shut down, and the pirate was 
lifted into the air. Zelda was just about to destroy him when...

&quot;Zelda wait right there!&quot; Samus yelled. She marched towards Zelda, 
dragging along a battered pirate. She threw the pirate down and then 
looked up at the bigger one.

&quot;Where is the mother brain?&quot; She demanded. The pirate just chuckled.

&quot;You think I&#39;d tell you anything?&quot; He replied.

&quot;I don&#39;t really think you are in any position to debate such a thing.&quot; 
Samus looked at Zelda and nodded. Zelda began crushing the big pirate. 
Samus held up her hand, and Zelda stopped.

&quot;This girl here could destroy you in an instant. You don&#39;t want to die 
do you? Tell us and we will release you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll just come back and attack again, with more pirates, or alone.&quot;

&quot;Tell us or she&#39;ll kill you in a most painful way.&quot;

&quot;You think my life alone has any meaning to the Mother Brain? If you 
must destroy me because I won&#39;t talk... SO BE IT!&quot;

Samus grumbled with her head in her hand. She nodded to Zelda, and the 
pirate was vaporized. Samus turned to the smaller, battered pirate.

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t be a fool as well and not reveal anything? We migt have to 
kill you as well.&quot;

The pirate just laughed and laughed and laughed and gave her the finger. 
In less than a second, he was squirming around. Samus had thrust her 
blade into his crotch, and then slowly dragged it up.

&quot;Damn you pirates. Damn you Mother Brain.&quot;

Samus marched off to her ship and Zelda watched her go.

After extensive repair, and numerous medical bills, everything was 
finally returned to normal, after 3 days.

Zelda had gotten used to the technology around her and was no longer 
afraid of the machines that did metalworking on the ship. She enjoyed 
watching the machines. They fascinated her. She was also comfortable 
with walking around the station, and quickly learned where everything 
was.

Samus on the other hand, was still frusterated, searching through 
computer after computer, trying desperately to find anything that might 
lead to the Mother Brain&#39;s whereabouts. Samus had eaten hardly anything, 
just enough to keep from collapsing from hunger. Zelda admired Samus&#39;s 
persistence, and her strong will, but she worried for her health.

&quot;Of course you can use the cooking equipment. I&#39;ll be glad to help out 
in any way I can.&quot; The head chef told Zelda.

Zelda had wanted to make Samus a special meal for working so hard. She 
had a little cooking experience, but all of it was back in the castle, 
with the help of the royal chefs. And she never owned an electric stove.

&quot;What are you planning on cooking?&quot;

&quot;Something... anything. I want to make a meal for the hardworking 
Samus.&quot; Zelda replied. &quot;But I don&#39;t know hardly anything about the food 
here, or the equipment.&quot;

&quot;You could try an old fashioned chicken with salade and a bowl of fruit. 
Garlic bread works well also. I have no clue what Samus likes, but 
you&#39;ll know in your heart what she&#39;ll like.&quot;

Zelda looked at him like he was some hopless romantic.

&quot;Sorry, hehe, just got a little into the cooking spirit there. Whaddya 
say to that idea huh?&quot;

&quot;Great idea. Let&#39;s go to work.&quot;

&quot;Alright then let&#39;s...&quot;

&quot;One question. What&#39;s garlic bread?&quot;

A crash to the floor was all the chef did in response.

After a few hours of hard sweating work, Zelda and the chef finally 
finished their masterpiece, or so that&#39;s what the chef called it. Zelda 
put it on a tray and carried it to Samus&#39;s ship.

&quot;Nothing in the Nerubian galaxy... Ah General Hoffman replied. Maybe 
he&#39;s got a lead.&quot;

Samus was still hard at work on the computer. So hard at work that she 
didn&#39;t hear Zelda and John coming down the ladder with the tray of food, 
and set up a small table. She didn&#39;t even hear them talking.

&quot;I hope this works. I haven&#39;t seen Samus in this kind of trance since 
the space golems became a threat. But this tops even that. Good luck.&quot; 
John said as he climbed out.

Zelda walked slowly over to Samus and knelt down beside her.

&quot;Damnit Halfass Hoffman. Why&#39;d you even bother replying if you didn&#39;t 
have anything.&quot; Samus yelled. Still busy, she didn&#39;t even notice when 
Zelda leaned her head on Samus&#39;s shoulder. After waiting a minute, Zelda 
finally got tired of that position. The next thing she did, Samus did 
notice. Zelda snuck under Samus&#39;s arm, and put her hand on Samus&#39;s leg.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Samus just stared at Zelda, eyes twitching. Zelda then proceded to 
put her arms around Samus&#39;s waist and hug her.

&quot;Zel- Zelda! What has gotten into you?&quot; Samus yelped.

&quot;You have been sitting at this computer for three days now, with only 
half a day&#39;s eating. I&#39;m worried for you.&quot;

Oh great. Samus thought. She&#39;s hitting on me. She probably wants to get 
in bed with me or something.

&quot;I know I know. I&#39;ll gorge on food when I&#39;m done here.&quot; Samus replied, 
trying to pry Zelda&#39;s arms off.

&quot;Okay then.&quot; Zelda replied simply. She let go of Samus and stood up.

What!? This girl is confusing me.

&quot;You&#39;re okay with that?&quot;

Zelda nodded

&quot;Um... I... Why?&quot;

Zelda faced the computer, hit the shortcut for save and switched the 
computer off.

&quot;HEY!!!&quot;

&quot;I saved the files, don&#39;t worry.&quot;

&quot;Yeah but I was working here. I&#39;ll eat when I&#39;m done okay!&quot;

&quot;Okay then let&#39;s eat.&quot;

Samus, completely shocked and confused, stared at Zelda with no 
defineable expression on her face.

Zelda smiled and stepped to the side, showing off the food she brought 
in. Samus&#39;s eyes went wide. She was a total meat eater at heart, being a 
tough and rowdy girl.

&quot;Wow. Who made... did you make this?&quot; Samus stood up slowly.

&quot;I got a little help from the head chef, but otherwise, yes.&quot;

Samus walked to the table, and circled it for a moment before Zelda 
pushed a chair under her and slid her up to the table. With that, Zelda 
sat down at the other end of the table. She was still smiling joyfully. 
Samus ripped off a chunk of meat and began chowing down, like a crazed 
lunatic, completely uncivilized. Zelda&#39;s smile turned into a look of 
surprise, then half disgust, with a few twitches. Samus stopped chomping 
to look up at Zelda, half a piece of chicken still in her mouth. She 
took it out, and set it on the plate, very proper. She then took a 
napkin and dabbed the corners of her mouth. This caused Zelda to laugh. 
The both of them smiled at each other, and finished eating the meal.

After the meal, Samus was exhausted. The three days of staying awake 
finally caught up to her. She told Zelda that she would be in her room.

&quot;If I snore too loud, bang on the door.&quot;

Zelda giggled a bit at Samus&#39;s joke, although it was a serious request. 
Samus went into her room and shut the door.

Zelda remained in the control room. She sat down in Samus&#39;s chair, and 
looked out again. The metal structure around the ship, which had scared 
Zelda so much before, now felt a little more homely.

Home. She remembered her home. The castle which had been her home for so 
long, now seemed so far away in her heart. She remembered the Zora. The 
graceful, noble Zora. The bumbling yet loveable Gorons. There were the 
childish Kokiri, whom she had played with as a child. She even missed 
the Gerudo, the female savages. Everything seemed lost. Zelda turned on 
the computer. She had learned a bit about computers, so she would be 
able to use this. She went into a universal database, and typed in 
Hyrule for search. The computer turned out no such existing place, and 
no records of there ever having been any such existing place. She next 
searched Hylian. Nothing. There were no such things as Hylians, Zora, 
Gorons, Kokiri, or Gerudo. As a last resort, she tried Link. There was 
one match.

Link was a competitor in the tournaments, and he was rather skilled.

&quot;Maybe if I find him, I can find out what happened to me.&quot;

Zelda considered something. Worried, she tried searching for Ganon. One 
match. Ganon was also a competitor in the tournaments, and he too was 
quite good. He and Link were tied for third in fact. So many unexplained 
things, she just wanted to go home. She fell asleep in the chair, 
without a sound.

Samus awoke to hear crying. She stood up, not even bothering to change 
into normal clothes. Instead she took her blanket with her. Walking out 
her room door, she made sure the hatch was closed and locked, and walked 
ot the control room to find a sleeping Zelda, sprawled on the floor, 
there were tears in her eyes, and on the floor, even stained in her 
robes. Samus sighed and kneeled down on the floor. She scooped up Zelda 
into her arms and held her. Zelda was crying again, repeating the words,

&quot;I want to go home. I want to go home.&quot; 

Samus held her tight and rested her head on Zelda&#39;s. She started humming 
a theme called Tamashii No Rufuran. Something from an anime called 
Evangelion. Zelda realized someone was holding her, comforting her. She 
wrapped her arms around Samus and rested her head against her chest. 
Samus&#39;s face tensed up for a moment, almost blushing. Fortunately she 
was wearing her usual undergarments, the bikini. Even still, to be half 
naked, sitting on the floor, holding a girl, who was holding her back, 
and putting her head on... and to top it off, they had a blanket over 
them.

&quot;You know what, screw it.&quot; Samus picked Zelda up and brought her back to 
her room. She set Zelda into her bed, and climbed in as well, still 
holding her.

&quot;This means nothing between us okay. I don&#39;t have any attraction to 
you.&quot;

Samus clearly stated that, but she couldn&#39;t notice how attractive Zelda 
looked sleeping in her arms. Samus shook off the thought and simply 
said, 

&quot;Good night princess.&quot;

and then fell asleep again.

Samus finally woke up after a good rest. she still had Zelda in her 
arms, sleeping like a baby.

I guess I misjudged her. She didn&#39;t try anything lesbian on me.

Samus released Zelda and sat up. Only then did she notice, Zelda had put 
her leg up over Samus&#39;s hips. Irritated, Samus gently pushed the leg 
off, and got out of her bed. She tucked Zelda in again, and put on some 
clothes. Then she left and went to the front room.

&quot;Huh?&quot; She said surprised. She hadn&#39;t noticed the night before, but the 
computer was on. Samus sat down to the computer and checked it. She 
found the names that Zelda was searching. 

&quot;So you DO know Link, and Ganon as well. What&#39;s all this mumbo jumbo 
about Zoras and Kokiris and all?&quot; She looked through her searches. 
Nothing had been found about any of the names Zelda entered, with the 
exception of Ganon and Link.

Suddenly a knock at the hatch. Samus got up to look through the camera. 
She saw a familiar foxlike figure standing there. He knocked again.

&quot;Hold on a sec! Jeeze.&quot; Samus marched up to the ladder and opened the 
hatch. She climbed up the ladder and into the access tube, where she 
encountered the fox man, a falcon man, a frog man, and a bunny man. 
Where had she seen them before.

&quot;Samus Aran? Is that you?&quot; asked the fox.

&quot;Wait a second... Fox?&quot; Samus shouted.

&quot;Ah you do remember me.&quot; He replied exchanging buddy hugs and 
handshakes.

&quot;I haven&#39;t seen you guys in, gods, years anyway. Come on down.&quot;

The five of them climbed down into Samus&#39;s ship. Fox and Samus stood. 
Falco and Peppy (the bunny) sat in chairs. Slippy lived up to his name 
by slipping on Zelda&#39;s tear puddle. He sat as well, rubbing his bum.

&quot;I guess I forgot to clean that last night.&quot; Samus remarked.

&quot;What&#39;d you do, forget to use the toilet?&quot; Falco joked.

&quot;Ah ha Falco. Your attitude stinks as usual. No I spilled a glass of 
water last night.&quot; Samus was not going to tell them that her friend was 
crying on the floor.

&quot;So what are you guys here for? You guys should be out fighting evil.&quot; 
Samus asked them.

&quot;We could say the same about you Samus. Why are you staying here, 
shouldn&#39;t you be out fighting pirates or somethin&#39;.&quot; Peppy return the 
question.

&quot;Well... I... the Mother Brain escaped my grasp again. I&#39;m staying here 
until I can track it. So why are you here?&quot;

&quot;You may be in luck Samus my friend.&quot; Fox stated. &quot;We have a good idea 
of where she is hidden, and where the pirates are keeping her.&quot;

Samus nearly jumped him and grabbed him by the throat, but restrained 
herself. She had some odd ways to be excited.

&quot;Look who&#39;s up. Rise and shine early bird.&quot; Falco joked. Everyone looked 
to where he was looking. There was Zelda, with the blanket wrapped 
around her, and looking like a wreck. She half smiled and waved.

&quot;You don&#39;t... you know... sleep with..&quot; Peppy started.

&quot;What!!! What makes you say that?&quot; Samus yelled back. &quot;We&#39;re getting off 
the topic.&quot; Whirling back to face Fox, and completely forgetting Zelda.

&quot;What&#39;s this about the Mother Brain? Where is she?&quot; Samus demanded.

Zelda looked herself over and decided she needed new clothes.

&quot;Samus, do you have any clothes I could wear? Mine are old.&quot;

&quot;Tell me about it.&quot; Falco joked again.

&quot;Yeah, just choose whatever fits you... um... the closest.&quot; Samus told 
her, realizing that she was much bigger than Zelda. Whirling back around 
to Fox, again.

&quot;I&#39;ll show you on the map.&quot; Fox said before Samus even took a breath. 
Falco got up out of the chair, and Fox sat down. He began typing away. 
Soon a space map appeared and Fox went searching through it. Finally he 
stopped and pointed to a blank spot.

&quot;There is a planet here. That&#39;s where the Mother Brain probably is. We 
were flying on scout missions when we noticed a number of sizeable 
pirate ships orbiting the planet. We decided against finding out more 
and retreated. Slippy noted that the planet did not exist in records. 
Peppy seemed to recall there being a planet right there in the 
databanks.&quot;

&quot;We suspected that the pirates hacked into the databanks and erased all 
data on this planet.&quot; Slippy told Samus.

&quot;I&#39;m going to the store to buy myself some clothes, for myself.&quot; Zelda 
announced from behind the group.

&quot;You still won&#39;t be able to buy anything with rupees. Take this.&quot; Samus 
tossed some credits to Zelda. &quot;That should buy you a small wardrobe&#39;s 
worth.&quot;

Zelda thanked her, bowed her head, and left.

&quot;Your girlfriend is wierd Samus.&quot; Falco again, this time Samus decked 
him.

Zelda walked through the massive halls looking for the clothes store. 
After a few minutes she finally found it and went inside. She bumped 
into a tall man with silver hair and dark clothes. She glared at him 
behind his back and continued into the store.

Zelda found lots and lots of robes that suited her perfectly. The 
clothes that she wore, Samus&#39;s clothes, were all much to large, and she 
couldn&#39;t get used to the pants thing. She bought a number of robes. 
Beauty robes, all the way to combat robes. She hardly used up any of 
Samus&#39;s money. Either she bought really cheap stuff, or a small wardrobe 
consisted of fifty clothes.

She walked out of the store and decided she was hungry. She walked 
towards the cafe.  When she got there she breathed in the smell of food.

&quot;Excuse me ma&#39;m.&quot; a voice behind her.

She turned around to find the rude man in the dark clothes.

&quot;You&#39;re excused!&quot; she said. She turned back around and started towards 
the food.

&quot;Wait a sec. I&#39;m sorry about earlier. I didn&#39;t see you. I was in a rush 
and forgot to apologize.&quot;

&quot;So you came back just to apologize?&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s one.&quot;

Zelda turned around and looked up at him. He was TALL. His sword, 
sheathed on his belt, was taller.

&quot;What do you want?&quot; she sighed.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you the girl who hangs out with Samus all the time?&quot; He asked, 
he brushed his silver hair out if his eyes.

&quot;Yes. What of it?&quot;

&quot;I must speak with her about the Mother Brain. I hear she&#39;s searching 
for it.&quot;

&quot;And...&quot;

&quot;I hurry to the point. Could you direct me to her ship?&quot;

Zelda pointed in a direction. &quot;It&#39;s bay... 35 I think.&quot;

&quot;Thank you very much.&quot; He bowed to her, his hands at his sides. Then he 
left.

He looks somewhat familiar. Whatever, I&#39;m hungry.

The man walked down the hallways towards bay 35. Sure enough it was 
marked with Samus&#39;s name on it. He entered and walked down the access 
tube, drawing his sword.

&quot;Okay so when Zelda gets back, we&#39;ll go.&quot; Samus confirmed. Everyone 
agreed to the plan.

&quot;I wonder...&quot; Samus muttered.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Samus?&quot; Fox asked.

&quot;Zelda was searching for something last night, and she rarely does 
anything false. So what she was looking for must exist.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re saying that this planet might be her&#39;s?&quot; Falco&#39;s first non-joke.

&quot;Maybe. I&#39;m just curious. I&#39;ll get her there and see.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully the planet won&#39;t decide to explode when you get there.&quot; 
Slippy mentioned.

&quot;Well, this station is holding up pretty well. It survived a pirate 
attack.&quot; Samus told them.

&quot;From the looks of it, the station is Samus curse proof.&quot; Peppy said.

No one heard the tall man drop down into Samus&#39;s ship.

&quot;Samus Aran?&quot; He asked.

Samus and the others turned around. In a flash the man thrust his sword 
deep into Samus&#39;s gut. The Starfox team pulled out their blasters and 
almost fired.

&quot;Brilliant idea boys. Blast at me and rip up the ship from the inside. 
We&#39;ll all die. Well, you will, but I will survive the explosion.&quot; He 
slowly pulled the sword out of Samus. She groaned in pain and collapsed 
to the floor.

Zelda gasped and felt a quick pain in her gut. She dropped her food on 
the floor.

&quot;What happened?&quot; she asked to no one. She heard for an instant, what she 
thought to be Samus&#39;s voice.

In pain? What&#39;s going on?

She raced to the bay.

Fox deflected the sword with his boots. He dashed in and grabbed the man 
by the throat, lifting him up. Slippy and Peppy were at Samus&#39;s side, 
while Falco was ready to back Fox.

&quot;Samus hang in there!&quot; Slippy yelled. His mind raced trying to figure 
out how to fix this.

&quot;Who are you!?&quot; Fox demanded, staring up into the man&#39;s... blue... 
glowing eyes.

&quot;You mean you don&#39;t recognize me? I almost killed you back then. You 
were so new to this fighting thing, so I decided to spare you.&quot; He said.

Fox growled and slammed him into the wall again.

&quot;How... I thought he killed you.&quot;

&quot;You both thought wrong my friend. You, and him, and his entire group.&quot;

&quot;Who the hell is this guy?&quot; Falco asked.

&quot;Sephiroth!&quot; Fox growled.

&quot;I must go, to tell her that I have fullfilled her wishes.&quot; With that, 
Sephiroth vanished in a black flash.

&quot;Damn!&quot; Fox yelled, slamming his fist into the wall. Samus groaned 
loudly.

&quot;Why did this... how did this happen... AAAAAGH! Samus yelped again as 
her shredded intestines shifted and fell.

Fast footsteps could be heard getting louder. Soon panting could be 
heard. Fox and Falco prepared themselves. Zelda jumped down the hatch. 
She was panting hard. She looked around the ship to see Fox and Falco, 
more than ready to attack something, and Slippy and Peppy wrapping Samus 
up in a bloodstained towel.

&quot;Great idea to have a vertical exit Samus.&quot; Slippy complained as they 
carefully brought Samus up through the hatch. They ran carefully with 
Samus, trying to get her to the medical center as fast as possible. 
Zelda fell against a wall, trying to take in what just happened. She 
slid down to the floor. Fox motioned to Falco to follow Slippy and 
Peppy, and Falco took off.

Fox turned to Zelda to see her, crying. He knelt down next to her, but 
did not hold her. Instead he put a hand on her shoulder.

&quot;You love her don&#39;t you?&quot; He asked.

Zelda looked up at him, wiping away some tears.

&quot;I...I...yes.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s alright. There&#39;s nothing shameful in loving someone of the same 
gender. I don&#39;t have any experience in such a matter, although a boy did 
hit on me once.&quot; Fox said, chuckling.

Zelda giggled a bit, tears still in her eyes. Fox looked back to her.

&quot;I know how much it hurts to lose someone you love. I do have experience 
in that.&quot;

Zelda looked up at him again.

&quot;You truly loved her?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Yes, of course. I had never cared for anyone else in my life, and I 
still have yet to care for anyone else. The opportunity may never appear 
again.&quot; He looked into Zelda&#39;s eyes. &quot;If you truly love Samus...&quot;

Zelda nodded.

&quot;I will do everything in my power to save her. You must do everything 
you can as well. You may never meet another girl, or boy, like her. I 
will not let you lose her.&quot;

Zelda smiled up at Fox and hugged him. Fox, a bit startled, took a 
moment then hugged back.

&quot;AAAAAAGH!!&quot; Samus screamed and squirmed. She knew she shouldn&#39;t. Slippy 
and Peppy were standing over her. as she lay on the patient&#39;s bed. The 
doctor was frantically deciding what to do, but frankly, it would be 
impossible to restore her.

Samus screamed again and clenched the bedside handle, eventually 
breaking it off. Her heart rate jumped on the moniter.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry. I can&#39;t find anything I can do. There is something 
inside, an energy, that is stopping her body from healing, and it&#39;s 
damaging her continually. I can only pick it up on a scanner, nothing 
affects it. It&#39;s almost like... dare I say... magic.&quot; The doctor 
explained frantically as Peppy grew enraged. Falco came in with two 
bottles.

&quot;Here are the things you requested.&quot; He said giving the items to the 
doctor.

&quot;If this doesn&#39;t work, she&#39;s out of my help.&quot; The doctor took one bottle 
and opened it. Fox and Zelda walked in. 

&quot;Wait a second. What is that?&quot; Slippy asked. The doctor gave the bottle 
to Slippy.

&quot;This... this is accelerator fluid! What the hell are you doing putting 
accelorator fluid into her?&quot;

&quot;This often works with viruses and some diseases. It accelorates the 
affects, but so much that it will often override the sytstems of the 
problem making it cancel itself out.&quot; Explained the docor.

&quot;If you haven&#39;t noticed, ACK!!! This isn&#39;t exactly a disease.&quot; Samus 
yelled.

&quot;Don&#39;t use it.&quot; said Fox. &quot;What&#39;s the other stuff?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s X-virus mixed with Metroid blood. It works onACK!!!&quot;

Fox grabbed him by the throat and lifted him up, just as he did to 
Sephiroth.

&quot;If you DARE THINK of putting that stuff in her systems, I will 
personally strap you to a table, disect you, and put each piece of you 
through the garbage disposal!&quot; Fox glared into the doctor&#39;s eyes. &quot;Do I 
make myself clear!?&quot; 

The doctor nodded, scared like hell. Fox set him down.

&quot;Wait, did you say metroid?&quot; Samus asked, wearily.

&quot;Yes, metroid blood.&quot; The doctor answered.

&quot;Put it in. Just do it. I seem to have good luck with metroids.&quot;

The doctor looked at Samus, and then Fox. Fox sighed and nodded.

&quot;Here goes.&quot; He poured some of the mixture into Samus&#39;s gut. Samus 
sighed a sigh of relief, but the doctor was not reasurred.

&quot;I am sorry, it has no effect as well. There is nothing more I can do.&quot; 
He said a quick prayer and left silently.

&quot;I can&#39;t feel the pain anymore.&quot; Samus moaned wearily. The heart rate 
moniter was slowing down, little by little. The Starfox team put their 
hands together and said their own prayer. Then they left, except for 
Fox. He walked over to Samus and keeled down beside her. He took her 
hand in his, and put his forehead to it.

&quot;Samus. You cannot die. You won&#39;t die, I know it. You have found ways to 
escape death more times than either of us can count. The greatest bounty 
hunter can&#39;t be defeated by mere magic. I shall give this to you.&quot; He 
pulled a crystal out of his jacket, a crystal that used to fit on a 
wooden staff. He put it in Samus&#39;s hand and closed it over the crystal. 
He stood up and walked to the door.

&quot;Keep that crystal, and don&#39;t die on me. I will be back as soon as I can 
with a healer. Just stay alive.&quot; He walked out.

Samus turned her head to Zelda, who was yet again, crying. Samus brushed 
her hand against Zelda&#39;s cheek. She looked up.

&quot;What now? You cry at every little thing. You need to be strong in life. 
I&#39;m not crying.&quot; Samus smiled.

&quot;I...&quot; Zelda began.

&quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; Samus replied. She opened her arms for a hug. Zelda sat on the 
bed, and carefully hugged her, crying hard.

&quot;Samus... I don&#39;t know how to say it.&quot;

&quot;Let me guess, you don&#39;t happen to have any cool tricks for this 
situation do you?&quot;

Zelda laughed and smiled

&quot;No. I... I l-lo...&quot;

The heart rate moniter went flat. Zelda just sat there, crying still.

&quot;Samus. I wanted to say I loved you. I don&#39;t know why, I just do. You 
are so strong. In your mind, in your body. You have such incredible 
determination. I admired that. You were there for me when I needed you, 
even if you didn&#39;t love me. I felt safe in your arms when I cried for my 
home, for my safety.&quot;

She put her hand on Samus&#39;s cheek, and brushed her thumb over Samus&#39;s 
lips.&quot;When I cried for someone to love. That night, I kissed you. I 
don&#39;t know what came over me, but I did. I&#39;ll do it again though. I love 
you.&quot;

Zelda leaned her face down to Samus. Their lips met, and a fire lit up 
inside Zelda. She felt the same wonderful feeling inside that she felt 
when she kissed Samus the night they slept together, in each other&#39;s 
arms. She scooped up Samus&#39;s lifeless body into her arms and held her 
there, still kissing her. Suddenly she felt Samus kiss back, and wrap 
her arms around her. Zelda and the now life filled Samus felt magic 
flowing through their bodies. The dark magic inside Samus&#39;s wound fought 
to stay, to kill Samus. However the power of Zelda&#39;s magic, combined 
with her emotions, and Samus&#39;s will to fight and stay alive, destroyed 
the dark magic. White energy flowed from Samus&#39;s wound and sealed it up.

Finally the burst of magic stopped, and Samus and Zelda found themselves 
lost in their kiss.

After what felt like a lifetime, a wonderful lifetime, they ended their 
kiss and brought their faces back. They refused to let the other go 
though, as if the other would die if they stopped holding each other.

&quot;The entire time huh?&quot; Samus finally broke the silence.

&quot;Well, just after you first tucked me in on your ship.&quot;

&quot;Well, how could I let such a beautiful girl sleep cold?&quot;

Zelda smiled and giggled slightly.

&quot;I love you Samus.&quot;

&quot;As do I, love you, Zelda.&quot;

They kissed again, and lay on the patient&#39;s bed for a long time.


(Don&#39;t even ask me why I included Sephiroth into this. It just seemed 
like a cool idea, and he kinda snuck his way in. There will probably be 
more anime surprises, like Marth and Roy... well, now they aren&#39;t really 
surprises anymore. This story is far from over, and I intend to finish 
writing it.)
