fanfiction by <a href="../authors/asinistre.html">Ange Sinistre</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/kisaki-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>A Violent Wind

Her head throbbed as another mind tried to take control, and her body 
burned as fire. Heat shot up her spine and spread through her limbs. It 
was as if it were a fever brought on by unknown circumstances. She was 
being torn in two and haphazardly placed back together again with pieces 
put into different areas. In one instance she wanted to run and scream 
at the top of her lungs. In another instance, she wanted to embrace what 
ever was happening to her and cling to as much power as she could. 
Insecurity and supreme confidence battled for domination. This was a 
sickness. This was a blessing from above. Her mind teetered back and 
forth.

Memories floated in from the deepest recesses of her mind. She could see 
the Shinso, of all people, caring for her. When had the Shinso, a long 
dead Otome warrior, been her servant? No, that wasn&#39;t simply the Shinso. 
That was Himeno Fumi, the previous incarnation of the maiden. She saw 
Nagi in multiple lights. In one moment he was the noble son of a 
samurai. In another he was something darker and more sinister. Yellow 
eyes stared at her while a mouth twisted into a smirk of satisfaction. 
Her eyes failed to function as crystal closed in around her, tighter and 
tighter and tighter still...

Her chest tightened as that sensation continued to overwhelm her. 
&quot;Ann-san, I need out of here.&quot;

The tunnel was suffocating her further as that claustrophobic sensation 
clamped down. The Annam princess got to her feet but was hesitant to 
move further. The Zipang honorific merged with traditional Windbloom 
German had thrown her off. She seemed confused. &quot;Just get out of here? 
But above ground might be too hostile, and those other two Columns...&quot;

&quot;Ima!&quot; Zipang now came more freely than Windbloom German. Ann had to 
adjust accordingly as Mashiro continued. &quot;I do not feel well. I need 
air. Right now.&quot;

The elder woman turned her head to look back up at the hole she had 
created just a few minutes ago. Walking beside the corpse of one of the 
fallen Otome, she tried to determine whether it was possible to get out 
from there or not. She didn&#39;t hear any fighting. There were no voices. 
Perhaps they were truly alone and it was safe above. Deciding that the 
rubble was stable enough to climb on, Ann hoisted herself up and 
extended a hand. &quot;If you must.&quot;

Mashiro broke the Maitreya blade down into photons so that she could 
climb with both hands. One grabbed onto Ann&#39;s and she felt herself lift 
off the ground thanks to a powerful tug from the other royal. Once 
there, she used her other hand to grab hold of a concrete block. She 
attempted to haul her trim body up onto the street, but found that her 
skills were lacking. She began to slip back down. Ann, noticing this, 
grabbed Mashiro&#39;s rear in an unladylike fashion and prevented her from 
falling any further.

&quot;H-hey! What do you think you&#39;re-- whoa!&quot; Mashiro protested. Ann gave 
her another shove and pushed her up onto the street. Mashiro grabbed the 
side of the road and lifted herself away from Ann&#39;s visiting hand. 
Mashiro got her feet and turned back around to help the other woman. 
Holding onto Ann&#39;s wrist, she pulled her up and out of the tunnel. Now 
free of the dusty confined space, they were allowed to breath in the 
crisp winter air. It would have been nice to see the sun, but like it 
was most of the time, clouds covered the sky.

While Ann determined whether or not the area was truly safe, Mashiro 
became trapped within her own mind as that Ikusahime heat flared up once 
more within her body. Kazahana, like a parasite waking up from within, 
began to plow through Windbloom&#39;s memories and claim them as her own. 
Mashiro found herself thinking in patterns that she normally wouldn&#39;t 
have. Was this the process everyone else had gone through when they left 
the Otome and became &#39;HiME&#39;? Was this real, or had she fallen under the 
same spell as the others?

When Kazahana finally gained control, Mashiro became melancholy and 
instantly appeared to be older than her actual years. She processed 
everything that had happened and began to try and determine how the 
Carnival could be stopped, like a mastermind plotting world domination. 
She was good with plans. She had won her own Carnival and in the 
succeeding one she had destroyed the cycle completely. Mashiro had not 
planned for man to interfere, but it was much too late. Something had to 
be done.

Part of her success came from the fact that she had three hundred years 
to work her magic and execute her plans. In those three hundred years 
she had become indifferent to the plights faced by the new generation of 
Ikusahime. While she felt and understood the pain Mai and the others had 
faced, she had moved them around like pawns on a chessboard, just as the 
Obsidian Lord had done. She had to be cruel in order to win. Mashiro had 
ensured that all of them would fall except for one. It was only when 
that happened that she could launch her final, surprise assault against 
that damned machine. While Windbloom wailed in protest, Kazahana decided 
that if she would have to use them all to win the Carnival a third time, 
she would.

Things were not on her side this time. Her memories were partially 
buried. She did not have the Elders to help her. The luxury of 
immortality was not in her possession and time was frantically short. If 
she was to make a plan, it would have to be thought up in a rush. Things 
would be sloppy. She would not have the same amount of control, and to a 
degree, that frightened her. A certain victory did not exist even with 
three hundred years of strategy. What were the chances of success now?

&quot;Mashiro.&quot; Ann&#39;s voiced lulled her out of her brain. &quot;Have you known you 
were one them from the start?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;How did it happen?&quot; She asked.

Mashiro fixed her eyes directly upon Ann, her stare piercing deep into 
Ann&#39;s soul. She who had been the queen no longer existed in her pure 
form. The darker Kazahana aspect now reigned. &quot;The Obsidian Lord decides 
who will become an Ikusahime. All of the current Ikusahime are new 
incarnations of warriors who once saved the world from evil and then 
fell to man. Two of them were unable to reprise their roles. Shinso was 
one. Natsuki was the other. I have been selected to fill Fumi&#39;s place, 
as I too am an incarnation of an even older HiME.&quot;

&quot;Natsuki&#39;s one? Why hasn&#39;t she shown any signs? Is she just concealing 
her power?&quot;

&quot;I cannot say for certain. The Obsidian Lord has seldom possessed a 
woman, much less one who had been an Ikusahime. She may be able to 
snatch them back from the person who currently has them. She may not be 
able to claim them at all given her position as the new host. I am 
investing in the latter scenario,&quot; Mashiro explained.

While Ann was still certainly confused as to what all this Carnival 
business was about, she only needed to know the vital pieces of 
information to find out how to be of assistance to all those involved. 
&quot;Why are they killing each other? How does it end?&quot;

&quot;There is a star that you cannot see. It will soon strike the Earth and 
destroy life as we know it. That is what the Obsidian Lord uses to 
manipulate the HiME, along with emotional interference. You&#39;ll see 
everyone act as if they are on edge when it isn&#39;t necessarily required. 
The twelve will fight until only one remains. She will be the world&#39;s 
savior, but will also be imprisoned to serve as the Lord&#39;s source of 
power. Then it will all begin again three hundred years from now.&quot; 
Mashiro then smiled. &quot;As for how it ends this time? Even I cannot see 
that.&quot;

Mashiro&#39;s sudden loss of youthful energy was mildly frightening. It was 
as if she was possessed herself. Everyone was just absolutely 
unpredictable! Motives, behavior, reactions... they were all so random 
now. &quot;Why don&#39;t they just kill Natsuki?&quot;

&quot;The OL is an entity who can possess anyone. If she dies, he&#39;ll find a 
new host. I don&#39;t know if you can destroy the computer, or Emulator, on 
which he&#39;s stored until the Star is destroyed, but...&quot; She paused 
mid-sentence as someone caught her eye. &quot;...But I think Nao is going to 
try.&quot;

Ann followed her gaze until she saw the former Spinel user in the 
distance, angrily marching right for Dammerung. When an Orphan drew too 
close, they watched Nao lash out with her wires. They cut through 
several beams on an overhang, causing it to collapse onto the creature 
and crush it into a bloody mess. Ann yelled out, concerned at whatever 
Nao intended to do, but she was ignored. The former Column was too far 
away to properly catch up with her. She was moving too fast.

Then they spotted a second. Dragging a long obsidian blade behind her, 
the ever childlike Mikoto ran after her &#39;team leader,&#39; equally 
concerned. Mashiro tried to get her attention instead. &quot;Mikoto! Where is 
she going?&quot;

Mikoto came to an abrupt halt, nearly tripping over herself as she did 
so. &quot;Since Shizuru left for the mountains before we could get her, 
Nao-san said she was going to go straight for Natsuki instead.&quot;

&quot;Of all the foolish nonsense...&quot; Mashiro muttered. She began to jog 
after Mikoto, and Ann could only follow behind with her naginata in 
hand. Mashiro watched Nao&#39;s distant movement. It was erratic and livid. 
She read into Nao as Kazahana would &#150; as someone who mainly knew her 
through extensive study instead of face-to-face communication. Yuuki 
Nao. Confirmed user of Julia Araneae. Expelled from multiple schools due 
to aggression and fighting. Does not care for teamwork. A lone wolf, 
much like Kuga. Easily manipulated by using her anger to one&#39;s 
advantage. Was the Lord luring her into a trap, or was this Nao&#39;s own 
doing?

They watched as Julia formed out of thin air and switched to her flight 
mode. Nao hopped onto the Child&#39;s back and it took off at full throttle, 
flying just as fast as an agile Otome. Whatever the reason was, Nao had 
to be stopped before she became another victim. You could not destroy 
the Star unless there were enough HiME to break it up, and Mashiro could 
not perform the same resurrection trick in their current situation. 
Things were artificial. Any unnecessary risk would potentially ruin 
their ability to end the new Carnival of Man. Ann was unaware and 
willing to fight. Mikoto was na&iuml;ve as ever. This made them easy to use. 
Mashiro took charge.

&quot;We must run after her and stop Nao before she can do something she will 
regret. She must not be allowed to fight against Natsuki or the 
Emulator,&quot; Mashiro commanded. &quot;Mikoto, where are the others?&quot;

&quot;Shiho-san went up to the mountains, and the kaichou followed. I&#39;ve only 
been able to find Nao, but she won&#39;t listen to me. Akira-kun and 
Azumi-san were separated during the chase. Mai&#39;s faction... I don&#39;t know 
what happened to them,&quot; Mikoto said with a frown.

&quot;We&#39;ll worry about that later, then.&quot; How could she pull her pieces back 
together in order to form a unified front against that renegade program? 
&quot;Let&#39;s just get Nao. We&#39;ll have to break the Otome lines to do it. 
Mikoto, can you summon Miroku as a Child?&quot;

&quot;I think so.&quot;

Both women materialized their respective swords and slammed them into 
the ground. Black spikes rose and rose further into the air until 
hulking shoulders sprang from the street. Ann grabbed onto one, using it 
as a handle as both Children showed themselves. Miroku and Maitreya as 
Children closely resembled one another. Low centers of gravity, each 
holding a massive steel bat laden with spikes. Mikoto&#39;s was a dull earth 
tone while Mashiro&#39;s was the color of blood. Both took flight, and Ann 
desperately clung to any surface in order to keep from falling off. The 
Children raced after Julia, powerful rather than fast. They would be a 
bit behind.

As the flew, Mashiro continued her meticulous planning and 
brainstorming. The Obsidian Lord was now nothing more than a renegade 
computer program. It was a human construction gone mad. There were only 
two HiME who could have properly dealt with that &#150; Alyssa and Yukino. 
They were coincidentally out of the Carnival. How easy would it have 
been for a skilled hacker to deal with this kind of situation? It was a 
skill that was sorely missing from what was left of the HiME arsenal.

- - -

Kagutsuchi&#39;s great wings let her glide down to where she had seen the 
faint green beacon. Had Mai been too late? She could not let herself 
believe that. The sound of a crying Child and the green sparks... they 
had been figments of her overactive and troubled imagination. The biting 
wind had simply interfered with Mai&#39;s usually hawk-like vision. Yet, 
when she completed her dive down towards the ground and allowed her 
Child to gently soar over the former battlefield, it was clear that 
Yatagarasu was no more. But where...? Where was Shiho? Where was... 
Shizuru? A purple kimono would surely stand out amongst the winter 
landscape. It was snow and dead trees. Color did not fit in. Her eyes 
continued to scan the area, and she could see Kagutsuchi&#39;s neck twist as 
he too looked for the missing murderer and victim.

Kagutsuchi stiffened and Mai followed the dragon&#39;s gaze skyward. There 
was a Child! Mai narrowed her vision as she watched it approach. Was it 
Kiyohime? No. Wrong color. It was red. As it drew closer, it was easily 
recognized as Gakutenou. Had Midori seen the sparks as well? As 
Kagutsuchi was all too willing to fight against anything and everything 
during a Carnival, Mai had to gently pet his back in order to calm him 
down.

&quot;Easy there, boy. That one&#39;s helping us. Gakutenou is not going to do 
anything,&quot; Mai cooed. Instead of screeching and tearing after the 
incoming Child, Kagutsuchi obeyed and gently flapped his wings in order 
to gradually gain altitude and meet Gakutenou halfway.

The Children both slowed to a near stop, with Gakutenou hovering and 
Kagutsuchi flapping his fiery wings to stay in place temporarily. Midori 
was the first to shout of the distance between them. &quot;You all right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Have you seen either Shiho or Shizuru?&quot;

Midori nodded, and her words made Mai somewhat anxious. &quot;Saw Shizuru, 
but only for a minute. Was heading northeast. Didn&#39;t see Shiho, but saw 
Yatagarasu take off from the steep side of the mountain. Maybe she was 
controlling him from up there!&quot;

Mai looked to the mountain and to the northeast. What to do? Who was the 
priority? Shizuru needed to be stopped, but Shiho could definitely not 
be left alone on a mountainside in her current zombie-like state. Midori 
seemed to have the solution in the face of Mai&#39;s slight indecisiveness.

&quot;I&#39;ll go pin Shizuru down while you take Shiho back to the HiME base. 
You come back and help me out if she won&#39;t listen to reason!&quot;

&quot;E-eh...&quot; Mai again found herself locked in internal debate. Was that 
wise? Would Midori hold her own in a fight against Shizuru, should it 
come to that? But Shiho needed care, otherwise she too would surely die. 
&quot;Fine! I&#39;ll be back as quick as I can!&quot;

Regardless of whether it was the best course of action or not, 
Kagutsuchi took Mai up towards the mountain while Midori was left to 
take Gakutenou back down towards the ground. Where in the world was 
Shizuru Viola? Midori kept her eyes fixed on the woods. Shizuru was good 
at outdoor survival. She remembered it from Aswad&#39;s clashes with the 
Otome and Viola. She would likely find cover and wait until the &#39;search 
party&#39; had gone. Or perhaps she would head for the ruins of Kusatsu and 
hide there? That too was likely. Midori followed a path that led towards 
that city.

&quot;Really...&quot; Midori complained, &quot;I&#39;m going to start charging these girls 
additional fees for their Sentai membership every time they try and 
break up the team. What troublesome teenagers.&quot;

She gained just enough altitude to give herself a wider view. Come on, 
kaichou-sama, you&#39;ve got to be around here somewhere, she thought. No 
one, not even Shizuru, could clear that much distance in such a short 
amount of time. Kiyohime was no where to be found and would stick out 
like a... a big purple flying octopus. No sense in finding a simile for 
that one. It worked well enough on its own.

She turned her head around to briefly look at Mai&#39;s distant form. Ah, it 
seemed like Kagutsuchi was slowing near a point on the mountain. They 
must have found Shiho. Good. At least Mai would be moving quick, then, 
should Midori need her assistance later. Feeling remotely safe at that 
thought, she continued to scan the woods, ordering Gakutenou to go 
slower so that she could get an even better view. Oh, for a world class 
GPS satellite. That would make everything easier.

She neared a flat clearing and saw a flash of purple and red. Ah! 
Shizu--! Midori&#39;s joy turned to surprise as a red chain wrapped around 
one of Gakutenou&#39;s forward limbs. The Child, now caught in Shizuru&#39;s 
&#39;net,&#39; promptly headed nose first towards the ground. Midori flew 
forward and landed unceremoniously as Gakutenou came to a sudden halt. 
She climbed to her feet and turned back around, only to find Gakutenou 
sticking out of the ground, his javelin like nose having impaled itself 
into the soil. It would have been funny if he wasn&#39;t completely and 
utterly vulnerable in that situation. Midori raced forward and summoned 
her Element as Shizuru drew close, hoping to pierce Gakutenou&#39;s softer 
belly.

She flung her labrys like a boomerang, and it sailed through the air 
with a light hiss. It hit Shizuru&#39;s bardiche and dropped to the ground, 
only to rematerialize in Midori&#39;s hand a second later. When Shizuru 
looked up to face her, that&#39;s when Midori got her. A distraction. 
Gakutenou pried himself free in that moment and wheeled himself away 
like a hotrod. An angry hotrod. Shizuru did not look happy at Midori&#39;s 
interruption.

&quot;Sorry, Fujino-san, but you&#39;ve got to deal with me before you get to 
stab Gakutenou full of holes,&quot; Midori declared. She pointed her Element 
at the murderous Ikusahime. &quot;Midori Sugiura, HiME of the Violent Wind, 
at your service.&quot;

Shizuru&#39;s neutral expression did not waver, but her eyes darkened. This 
would not do. This would not do at all.

- - -

When Mashiro&#39;s newfound team arrived at Dammerung, they could see a 
plume of dust and debris stemming from a hole recently made in the 
building. The Otome were scattered but quickly formed up again to deal 
with the new threat. Maitreya and Miroku accelerated and rammed through 
their defenses, knocking several Otome to the ground and forcing the 
rest to rapidly evade. The Ikusahime and Ann then jumped off, running 
into the puncture that could have only been left by Julia. The behemoth 
Children they left behind temporarily fought off the Otome before 
vanishing, their mistresses not willing to lose them to the expert Slave 
killers.

Mikoto had stormed in once before and Ann knew her way well enough. They 
led Mashiro back down, striking through anyone who dared to get in the 
way. Stairwell after stairwell was descended as they followed the sounds 
of crashes and dull hits. Nao was making straight for the Emulator room 
and not taking one step back. They caught her just before the Emulator 
room itself. It was a long, vast hall that Mashiro noted was perfect for 
an ambush. She did not like it one little bit.

It was Mikoto who slammed into Nao and grabbed hold of her like a judo 
champion. Nao struggled, screaming in fury. &quot;You damn brat, let me go! 
I&#39;m almost there!&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t!&quot; Mashiro warned. &quot;Don&#39;t you understand that if...?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t lecture me, queen!&quot; Nao hissed. &quot;I&#39;m not buying into the 
&#39;what-ifs!&#39; I&#39;m just going to end this here and now before they can kill 
any more of us! Shizuru left, but they&#39;re right here! We can do it!&quot;

&quot;Miyu is in there!&quot; Ann warned.

&quot;So what?!&quot; Nao finally broke free of Mikoto&#39;s hold, using a counter 
move she had learned at some point from a different style of fighting. 
With Mikoto on the ground, she leapt forward and made her way to the 
doors that sealed the Emulator off from the world. Three of the eleven 
lights were lit and the doors remained locked no matter how desperately 
she shoved on them. She tried the controls, but was denied access. &quot;Do 
any of you know how to hack into any of this shit? Dammit, if Yukino 
were here...!&quot;

Nao nearly gasped as the doors opened seemingly from her yelling alone. 
Was the power of bitching that effective? No. They opened just enough to 
let one slender person through. And Nao was met with eye that glowed 
bright red before fading to their &#39;natural&#39; color. Miyu. She was going 
to defend Alyssa to the digital death, wasn&#39;t she? Nao backed up and 
bared her claws, more than ready to destroy that damned android once and 
for all. She only ever got in the way.

When Miyu exited the room, the doors slammed shut once again. The lights 
flickered and dimmed, and everything became silent. Ann&#39;s eyes tilted 
up. All the security cameras were pointed straight at the group. All 
eyes were on them. Everyone refocused on Miyu once more as the android 
extended her arm blade. The others soon fell into combat stances as 
well. Ann tried to get the android to stand down. &quot;Miyu. We don&#39;t mean 
you any harm. We&#39;re just trying to get Nao out of here.&quot;

Miyu did not move and did not speak. There was a great hesitation before 
she turned her gaze to Mashiro, letting her eyes glow once more. When 
she did speak, her voice wavered between pitches and stammered. It 
sounded more like Natsuki than Miyu. &quot;The Y-y-y &#150; The Yggdrasil unit 
b-b-belongs to me, traitor. I t-t-told you that if you came here again, 
I would kill you.&quot;

Of course. Now that the Obsidian Lord was a program on a human computer 
instead of locked in the confines of an alien machine, it could no doubt 
infect anything. Perhaps Miyu had tried to get Alyssa out and the Lord 
had taken control of her directly to prevent that from happening. While 
Ann stiffened in what looked like fear, Miyu&#39;s eyes fixed onto the other 
combatants. When her gaze fell upon Mashiro, Miyu let out a shriek that 
nearly ripped their eardrums in half.

&quot;What are y-you doing here, Queen of-- Queen of Hell?!&quot; She howled in 
multiple pitches. Miyu and Natsuki&#39;s voices were swapped at will. 
&quot;A-a-always the rebel, s-s-see-ee-king to cause me irritation. I will 
not suffer your involvement in the Carnival any l-longer, you insolent 
brat.&quot;

When Miyu finally moved, it was a charge. She cut down with her sword 
arm, aimed straight at Mashiro. The teenage queen swung her own Element 
up to meet it. Blades slammed against each other and Mashiro rapidly 
backed up to give herself more room. Miyu seemed to be single minded 
about eliminating Mashiro, and ignored the other threats. The next time 
Miyu tried to attack, she found her arm wrapped up in Nao&#39;s wires. The 
android tried to shake them off as Mashiro scurried further away. 
Infuriated by Nao&#39;s involvement, Miyu swung her arm and hurled the 
attached Nao into the wall. The wires were retracted as Nao tried to 
stand up and ease her dizzy head.

Shizuru whipped her chain through the air, hoping to slicing into 
Midori. The quick thinking redhead dropped almost prone to the ground in 
order to avoid it, and popped back up like the diligent warrior she was. 
As Shizuru retracted the chain, Midori closed in, though she felt a mild 
pain in her head. She swung her labrys, only to have it parried by 
Shizuru&#39;s bardiche. It would have been an exhilarating fight if it was 
not to the death. Midori had seldom fought anyone who used a similar 
weapon. Labrys and bardiche smacked into each other time and time again 
as their owners swung them to and fro, desperately trying to get a hit 
on either body.

Shizuru retreated to chain range, but Midori cut her off. She hurled her 
Element like a boomerang once again, which was a powerful enough strike 
to cut through thick stone, as proven by her successful assault on a now 
long dead stone golem back in &#39;the good ole days.&#39; Shizuru balked at her 
own attack and rolled out of the way. Midori recalled her weapon and, as 
they were now a great distance apart, called in Gakutenou.

&quot;Gakutenou! Spiral Dash!&quot; She shouted.

The Child in the distance revved and then screamed in at blinding speed. 
The javelin nose sought to impale Shizuru through the abdomen, just as 
it had done with Fia Grosse three years before. But Gakutenou could only 
attack in a straight line with that kind of speed. Shizuru sprinted to 
the side and narrowly missed the speeding chariot as it rocketed passed. 
It skidded to a halt and awaited Midori&#39;s next command, but the HiME 
wanted to do things herself.

Midori closed in again and swung her weapon, which Shizuru blocked with 
the shaft of her own. Shizuru shoved the other female back, but Midori 
came at her with a kick instead of a blade. Fujino&#39;s prior back ground 
in martial arts began to kick in and she slid a few inches to the side, 
and redirected Midori&#39;s own energy with her hand, causing the redhead to 
fall to the ground. She quickly sprang up, however, to protect herself 
from a downward strike from the bardiche.

Midori kept looking to the south, which indicated that Mai was likely to 
come back. Shizuru had seen Kagutsuchi leave. There was to be another 
fighter, then? That just meant that Midori would have to be finished 
quickly. Shizuru sent a flurry of strikes out against the other woman, 
but Midori was naturally faster. She had always made such a show out of 
her Element, but it was not all for entertainment. All the incoming hits 
were blocked by that expertly used labrys. There was an Aswad glare in 
Midori&#39;s eyes, letting the anger and hostility that was not found in 
Sugiura rise to the surface. Midori al-Aswad was a much more vicious 
fighter. Was that even intentional, or had the younger persona taken 
over as a survival instinct?

&quot;Shizuru, just stand down and nothing will have to happen. We need to 
fight as one, you fool,&quot; Midori stated, but Shizuru could not obey. Not 
with what she had at stake. She flung her chain out, but Midori leapt 
over the low attack.

Midori kicked again after landing and closing, but Shizuru could not 
block it in time. She caught herself before falling, managing to stumble 
back instead of toppling over. Midori came at her with a rapid series of 
labrys combinations &#150; a violent wind of steel. The bardiche was up and 
bouncing back and forth as Shizuru attempted to block all the incoming 
hits. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, pause. Eight, nine, 
ten... Clash after clash. Midori was fast!

She nearly lost control of her Element in the midst of all that, and she 
swung the shaft up to aid her, catching the next series of strike. She 
was backing up and losing dominance. Could it be that Midori was better 
at personal combat than she was? Her usual ranged melee advantage was 
non-existent now, as Midori&#39;s weapon was similar in length. She didn&#39;t 
want to summon Kiyohime, but it might have ended up a necessity.

On the twenty-sixth strike within Midori&#39;s flurry of attacks, Shizuru 
lost her footing when met with a dead tree root. She fell onto her back 
and Midori turned her labrys up as if she was going to deliver a final 
death blow, Aswad clearly in control against Sugiura&#39;s wishes. When it 
came to combat, only one had the killer instinct, and the heat of combat 
had let all that emerge. Midori&#39;s grip on the axe tightened.

Ann&#39;s hands were locked against the Emulator doors as she tried in vain 
to pull them open as Miyu battled with the others. She was nowhere near 
fast enough with her robe to act as anything but a meatshield, and she 
was not necessarily anxious to play up that part. If she could open the 
doors, however, she could go deactivate that Emulator and give the 
others a chance to enter if she could not successfully make it all the 
way. Her eyes darted back to the battle, in which Mashiro remained the 
main target.

For all intents and purposes, Mashiro was doing quite well. She had 
allowed herself to be defeated by Mikoto in the last Carnival, because 
she needed Fumi to be defeated so that Mai could be the last. Now that 
was no longer part of her &#39;plan.&#39; Mashiro fought like any other HiME. 
And she did it all without hesitation. She swung Maitreya in various 
directions at various angles, trying to catch Miyu unexpectedly. Thanks 
to Mikoto&#39;s assistance, Miyu sported two very large scars in her 
exterior flesh. The robotic parts underneath were easily visible on her 
leg, where the attacks had landed.

Nao again tried to be of assistance by wrapping her wires around Miyu&#39;s 
leg. The android hit the ground and Mashiro nearly severed her head with 
Maitreya. The arm blade came up to stop it and Miyu stood up once more. 
She grabbed hold of the wires with her other hand and gave them a tug, 
snapping them free of her leg. It caused the superficial flesh 
surrounding the limb to tear and bleed, but Miyu did not care. The wires 
still in her hand, she gave them another pull. As Nao&#39;s gauntlets were 
still connected, she was taken forward and met with Miyu herself.

Nao disconnected the wires and threw a punch, but the only person it 
hurt was Nao. Metal skeletons were bad for hand to hand combat. Miyu 
shifted her other arm to the Gatling gun mode and fired at both Mikoto 
and Mashiro, forcing them to duck or flee before they could attack. 
Miyu&#39;s standard hand grabbed hold of Nao by the jaw. The redhead was 
lifted off the ground entirely, and she grabbed at Miyu&#39;s arm to try and 
get down. The air was being squeezed out of her throat and lungs.

&quot;Y-y-you are becoming a nuisance, and I th-think your run for first 
place has ended. Goodbye, Y-y-yuu-yuuki.&quot;

Nao&#39;s eyes widened as Miyu&#39;s grip became more intense, using every once 
of her cybernetic strength to close her fist around Nao&#39;s neck. 
Suffocation was forgotten as the spine threatened to break. Nao&#39;s body 
twitched and flailed as she struggled to get down, but Miyu would not 
allow it. Mashiro rushed in and let loose with a vertical chop after a 
pause in the gun. The blade slammed down onto Miyu&#39;s arms, fitting 
between the tight space between Nao&#39;s face and Miyu&#39;s torso. She 
attempted to sever the limb, and had she performed the attack on any 
mere human, it would have worked. Maitreya sliced into the flesh but 
stopped at the metal skeleton. Miyu slammed her gun arm down on the 
queen and knocked her over as her grip on Nao continued to tighten.

Nao&#39;s red nails were digging into Miyu&#39;s soft flesh after Mashiro&#39;s 
attack failed. Blood poured from the tissue damage, and soon enough 
Miyu&#39;s forearms were shredded down to the point where only the metal 
remained. Her hold on Nao did not loosen, even as the Ikusahime 
attempted to snare any vital part of her equipment with those Elemental 
nails. Mikoto stood up after ducking from gunfire to help, heaving her 
heavy Element up to try and chop as Mashiro had. Maybe just one more 
swing.

Miyu turned away from the attack and applied full pressure. Nao&#39;s muted 
whimpering fell completely silent as her neck was crushed all together, 
spinal cord and tissue and bone mingling within Miyu&#39;s robotic grip. 
Miyu released the body and watched as Nao&#39;s lifeless form crashed onto 
the ground with a sickening thud. Blood pooled around her, leaking from 
now the pencil thin piece of flesh that once separated her head and 
shoulders. Her body soon erupted in green mist.

Mashiro watched as it vanished into the Emulator doors. She watched, 
ignoring Mikoto&#39;s scream of fear, as the fourth light illuminated. Then, 
to her surprise, a fifth light began to glow. She raised her eyebrow. 
...Two?

&quot;I do love it when two of them are linked together,&quot; Natsuki said from 
behind them, having entered as Nao met her untimely death. &quot;Especially 
when the other doesn&#39;t realize that she is a valued person. What a 
tragedy.&quot;

- - -

Shizuru watched Midori as her body seized up without warning. What was 
to be a death blow became a failed attack, as the labrys was dropped by 
weakened hands. Midori&#39;s speed became a thing of the past. Everything 
seemed like it was in slow motion. After the labrys became embedded in 
the ground, it vanished in a plume of green. Midori sank to her knees as 
she felt her heart stop. Her hands desperately clutched her chest in 
pain. How...? Gakutenou had not been defeated. She had not even been 
wounded. How could...?

Midori looked up with sad but knowing eyes. It hadn&#39;t been her fault. 
Someone else had fallen. Someone who saw Midori as a beloved person. 
None of them did. How could that have been? As her feet faded into a 
green cloud that was taken by the exceptionally strong breeze, she 
slowly realized. The little ingrate had not been so ungrateful after 
all. Midori smirked at that.

After the Carnival, the younger woman had hit hard times. She&#39;d been 
living on the streets. Midori would have been a dreadful teacher to not 
try and do something for her former pupil and Sentai ally. One little 
offer for Nao to stay with her had been met with immediate resistance. 
&quot;I don&#146;t want to stay with you, you&#146;re a creepy old lecher who pretends 
to be a teenager.&quot;

To which the response had been, no, she pretended to be twenty-one at 
that point. Through ups and down Nao had come to stay with Midori and 
was raised under her care. From teaching Nao&#39;s classes at Kyoto 
University (the day she was voted most popular teacher after bringing a 
whip to school to serve as a discipline method) to having Nao sing her 
the Zyuranger theme on her traumatic thirtieth birthday (the day the 
sexy died), the pair had grown to be family. Well, in Midori&#39;s eyes, 
they had been family. She never thought Nao would have thought the same 
way.

But she had said her goodbyes to Yuuki Shika after the coma proved to be 
irreversable. And she had taken her new mother on Earl for granted. Nao 
Zhang had been a strange creature. She cared for few people, and even 
then it had not been enough to make them a Key. Not even Nina, who had, 
to a degree, softened her. With the resurrection of their memories, Nao 
had one last thing to hold on to &#150; that lovable lunatic who had tried to 
protect her and set her back on the right path after years of 
uncertainty.

Midori was simply saddened that, through it all, her heart had always 
favored another, much older friend. She was happy in her death, as she 
somehow felt content now, knowing of Nao&#39;s attachment. Midori could only 
hope that both Nao and Youko could forgive her &#150; the first for not being 
the subject of Midori&#39;s ultimate affection, and the second for being 
that ultimate affection. Neither situation was pleasant to be in. Death 
seemed to run with both, after all.

&quot;Fujino,&quot; Midori choked out as the green spread to her thighs and ran up 
past her hips. When Shizuru sat up and acknowledged her, Midori gave her 
a slight smile. &quot;Red ranger always beats the renegade ranger. I so would 
have won.&quot;

With that, Midori was finally broken down completely, her atoms snapping 
and forming photons, all of which were soon consumed by the Emulator. 
The fifth light out of eleven. Two had fallen in one unpredictable 
attack by a non-HiME.

- - -

Mashiro leveled her blade at Natsuki, but the possessed headmistress 
only chuckled dryly. &quot;Oh, yes, I remember that face. Always so eager to 
have your revenge after you learned that all of Nagi&#39;s advances and 
affections were false. What a pity that was. To have killed all your 
friends for his sake, only to realize he was nothing more than a 
puppet.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Mashiro replied. &quot;I&#39;ve learned that he&#39;s intolerable 
regardless of who&#39;s controlling his brain.&quot;

&quot;Are you becoming the opposing mastermind, now? Going to move all the 
pieces around to see if you can&#39;t beat me at the game of chess?&quot; Natsuki 
inquired, her katana resting in one hand. &quot;I don&#39;t see why you bother. 
You&#39;ve lost your moral right to act the hero. You care about these girls 
as much as I do. Not at all. We both see them as tools.&quot;

Mikoto finally snapped and lunged forward, swinging her blade out in a 
wide arc. To her surprise, the image of a great eye appeared before 
Natsuki. When Miroku hit, Mikoto found herself sailing back after being 
hit with astounding pressure from an invisible force. Like it could 
control Kagutsuchi before the Star was gone, it could also control 
Elements that were turned against it. The Obsidian Lord was invulnerable 
until the Star was destroyed. The theory had been correct, and Nao had 
simply thrown her life away.

&quot;Now, now,&quot; Natsuki said, channeling Reito&#39;s old personality. &quot;You 
mustn&#39;t do that, Mikoto. After all, I am still your ani-ue, despite the 
new body. You would not want to carry the weight of killing someone who 
protected you in the most dire of situations.&quot;

Ann finally let go of the doors and took up the naginata, not knowing 
what to expect. If that thing could control Elements and beings it once 
created, how would standard weapons fare? Natsuki noticed the change in 
attitude and stared right at the princess. Mashiro remembered. Reito had 
to fight Tate, who did not have an Element. Her gaze told Ann 
everything. Attack, attack, attack!

And she did. She tried to cut Natsuki&#39;s leg out from underneath with the 
blade of the naginata. The katana was unsheathed and blade clashed. 
Natsuki stared back with a variety of dark emotions. When the naginata 
came back a second time, a minor exchange began. It ended quickly, after 
the sixth failed hit, when Natsuki lurched forward and grabbed hold of 
Ann&#39;s fist. Ann felt herself falling into Nao&#39;s position, and hoped to 
god that Natsuki hadn&#39;t somehow made herself into a bone crushing 
cyborg.

&quot;You seem so eager to fight me and I am so eager to see you dead,&quot; 
Natsuki hissed.

The rest of her tirade was spoken by Miyu, who now shared the Obsidian 
Lord&#39;s conscious. &quot;Y-y-you could at least serve some purpose instead of 
walking around here l-like a useless pile of flesh. You&#39;re only good at 
seducing women a-a-and ordering others around, at present. It would 
be-e-e highly enjoyable to see you ripped apart by your former allies as 
the Carnival winds down.&quot;

&quot;What are--?&quot;

Ann&#39;s question was silenced as Natsuki, quite to her surprise, sealed 
her mouth with her own. While she tried to figure out why that was 
happening, as Natsuki hated Ann with every fiber of her being, another 
and more severe sense of invasion started to take place. Ann felt ice 
and heat, and not the pleasant kind, spread from Natsuki&#39;s lips. It 
swarmed Ann&#39;s own mouth, crept into her jaw, ran down her neck and 
pooled in her chest. Cold and hot. Fire and ice. Icicles formed on her 
bottom lip and lower jaw and a bright red mark appeared on her lower 
back, like receiving a brand.

Mashiro watched with both interest and horror. It was a direct transfer 
of power instead of selecting someone who had once been a HiME. Was Ann 
even an Heir? No, Mashiro did not sense that. Ann&#39;s entire genetic code 
was undergoing an irreversible change, and the princess&#39; eyes began to 
roll back into her head as she lost her bearings. Ann went limp, her 
skin laden with ice crystals, and Natsuki let her fall to the ground. 
The headmistress was smirking. Now Ann was properly condemned to death. 
She would never find a way to survive until the end. Her deal with 
Shizuru was still intact, to boot. Natsuki never cut Ann down. Not one 
strike.

Ice shards dug into Ann&#39;s hands and arms and she twitched as her body 
tried to accept the massive amount of power that had just been handed to 
her. Mashiro felt this was too far. They had to leave before anything 
else could possibly happen. She needed to find the others and destroy 
the Star. Act as the other mastermind. That was the only way to beat the 
Obsidian Lord &#150; at his own game. &quot;Mikoto, here!&quot;

As Mikoto scrambled to her side, Mashiro grabbed Ann and hauled her up. 
The queen snarled at her long time nemesis. &quot;If I ever find the planet 
where you were originally built, I&#39;m going to exterminate everyone there 
for my own amusement.&quot;

Natsuki said nothing, but the Dammerung speakers placed above the 
conventional exit came to life. The Lord had infected everything. 
Absolutely everything. &quot;T-t-touchy, aren&#39;t we, Queen of Hell?&quot;

Spikes came up from the floor and Maitreya the Child carried all three 
of the survivors out of the room, bursting through the ceiling and 
forming a gaping hole that led all the way outside. If only Nao would 
have listened to reason, this could have all been avoided! Mashiro&#39;s 
thoughts then turned to Ann, who had curled into a fetal position on the 
back of Maitreya. She whispered for help and convulsed as the searing 
pain stemming from her HiME mark swarmed her again. Poor child, Mashiro 
thought. She did not even deserve the same fate. She was too kind.

Natsuki clicked her tongue as they rocketed away. &quot;I do not know if I 
appreciate all these new skylights.&quot;

AN: For those of you who have read Kisaki exclusively, the Midori-Nao 
bond will seem odd. While I try not to strongly connect this to the 
older stories, that&#39;s something featured in the Kyoto Hunt and in the 
Calm. As is the Alyssa-Shizuru-Natsuki family connection.</pre>
