<h1>Oneesama (part 3 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leebot.html">Leebot</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/oneesama-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><p>Miss Maria’s Scorn</p><hr><p>Shizuru let out a disappointed sigh as she failed to find 
Natsuki in their shared apartment – covertly formed by installing an extra door between the 
Second and Third Columns’ official residences in Garderobe – when she returned home from her 
day at work. She allowed herself to collapse into a chair in their study and gazed out the 
window, having worn out every option for finding Natsuki hiding somewhere. Finding Natsuki 
waiting at home to surprise her was her last remaining hope for satisfactorily explaining 
her lover’s absence, and now that was gone.</p><p>After all the problems that had come up at 
the beginning of their relationship due to not communicating well enough with each other, 
Natsuki and Shizuru had made a promise to be as open as possible with each other to avoid 
such problems in the future. The only exceptions they allowed for this was when they were 
planning some surprise. Shizuru had been hoping that this was the case today, though she 
couldn’t think what the reason might be. It wasn’t anywhere near either of their birthdays 
or any particular anniversary of their relationship she could think of. Then again, with how 
Natsuki had been acting lately, surprising Shizuru for no reason wouldn’t have been too 
shocking. But sadly, that didn’t appear to be the case today.</p><p>Whatever Natsuki’s 
reason for leaving, Shizuru was left out of the loop on it. As far as she knew, Natsuki had 
always been completely open with her, and she’d tried to be so in turn. <i>No, wait…</i> 
Shizuru sighed, a little voice in her mind reminding her that there were indeed a couple 
things she’d been keeping secret from Natsuki. There was her role in the Natsuki Kruger 
fanclub for one, which she’d rationalized keeping secret as it had started before they’d 
made this promise to each other, and besides, the perks – access to every fanbook ever made 
which featured Natsuki – were just too good to risk on Natsuki’s possible 
reaction.</p><p>But that wasn’t the secret that had Shizuru most worried. Over a year ago, 
when she’d been captured during the Wind Uprising, she’d taken advantage of Tomoe 
Marguerite’s crush on her in order to effect her escape. Unfortunately, to do that she’d had 
to push the limits of remaining faithful to Natsuki. By her standards, she’d made it, but 
just barely. It had been Tomoe who kissed her, while she refused to reciprocate – at least, 
to anything like the degree she did with Natsuki – and later… well, at least she’d avoided 
having to have sex with the girl, which was enough of a victory, considering.</p><p>But if 
Natsuki had found out about that, and if she knew that Shizuru had been trying to keep this 
secret from her, then she’d certainly be furious. The fact that Shizuru had remained 
faithful to the best of her ability likely wouldn’t matter too much, though Natsuki might at 
least focus her rage on Tomoe instead. But perhaps Natsuki had been contacted by Tomoe, and 
that girl might well have exaggerated what had happened…</p><p><i>No.</i> Shizuru shook her 
head. Such a discovery would have made Natsuki immediately angry, and she’d confront Shizuru 
about it as soon as she could. She wouldn’t have run away from a problem like this; it just 
wasn’t in her personality. If she’d learned about it while Shizuru was out that morning, she 
might have even hunted her down and pulled her out of her meeting with Queen Mashiro to have 
it out with her.</p><p>Shizuru sighed and allowed a wry smile to cross her face. The pain of 
keeping that secret was starting to catch up with her. She really deserved that kind of 
treatment from Natsuki for it. It wasn’t fair to keep something like this from her; she 
really deserved to know. Perhaps it was time she got it all out. She didn’t want to move 
forward in their relationship with a heavy heart, and Natsuki certainly did seem intent on 
moving forward finally.</p><p>But that still left the problem of exactly what Natsuki was 
mad about now. With that possible explanation for Natsuki’s departure ruled out, Shizuru was 
left with only the possibility that Natsuki was mad at her for something that had happened 
soon before she’d left, but wasn’t quite as drastic as finding out about Tomoe. But what had 
she done wrong? Had her teasing gotten too much for the girl, perhaps? Natsuki did seem a 
bit more flustered than usual when Shizuru had given Arika a peck on the forehead earlier 
that day, but why would that get her so upset? Shizuru flirted with cute girls all the time, 
and Natsuki knew that she didn’t mean anything by it, didn’t she? It was just some harmless 
fun, and Natsuki was always so cute when she got jealous…</p><p>But there was a line between 
making her jealous and making her mad, and perhaps Shizuru had finally crossed it. It didn’t 
really matter what the specific reason was for this particular incident pushing Natsuki over 
the edge; all that mattered was that it did. Or if it was something else she’d done, even if 
she couldn’t think of it right now, it was still wrong if it hurt Natsuki. Nothing tore at 
her heart more than thinking that she’d somehow upset her love. She’d have to talk with 
Natsuki about this when she got back, so that she knew what exactly was the problem, and 
could then do whatever it would take to make things right – about this and her other 
secrets. She could only hope that Natsuki would choose one of their more enjoyable methods 
of punishment.</p><hr><p>My life went into a tailspin in the wake of my encounter with 
Natsuki. Her actions simply made no sense to me with the way I was thinking at that time, 
and I couldn’t just shrug off such an event as a simple oddity. I’d hurt her deeply, and so 
I couldn’t just let things go. Her betrayed expression haunted my mind and tore at my heart. 
As much as I tried, I just couldn’t shake it.</p><p>I went through the next day trapped in 
my own world, only making a token appearance at classes and the Trias meeting. I was so deep 
in my thoughts that I couldn’t even hear all of Haruka-san’s yelling through the meeting, 
even when she directed it at me for not paying attention to her. I think that meeting might 
have been the only time she ran out of steam on her own, as I just couldn’t focus enough to 
help redirect her energy to something more productive.</p><p>Fortunately though, Haruka-san 
was the only one with the poor tact to try to engage me in conversation at all that day. The 
rest of the school soon knew about what had happened between me and Natsuki. No one really 
knew what to say about it, and so most simply left me alone. As for Natsuki… well, they 
really didn’t have any option there. She spent the time holed up in her room, and it pains 
me to think of the depression she must have been going through.</p><p>I tried as much as I 
could to make sense of what had happened, but it was simply impossible under the current 
framework of my mind. I’d sorted the world out into two groups – those who were my fans and 
who wanted whatever they could get from me, and those who weren’t. Natsuki was obviously a 
fan – there was just no way around that – so why wouldn’t she want my touch?</p><p>I knew 
there were some other girls who respected and idolized me and yet didn’t want that kind of 
contact, but I didn’t really count them as my fans. They generally kept a greater distance 
when I was swarmed, and they were simply quiet and polite to me when we had a chance to 
interact. But they wouldn’t be the type to ask to become my heya-gakkari, knowing exactly 
what that would entail. Natsuki certainly wasn’t one of them.</p><p>To tell the truth, I 
think on some level I really knew what the problem was. As I reflected on Natsuki, images of 
my encounter with Anh a year ago flashed through my mind. I could see in her face the same 
expression I wore when Anh had nearly molested me, only much worse. Although I’d been able 
to keep Anh from actually going through with groping me, I’d never given Natsuki a chance to 
resist before I grabbed her breast. Even though she’d kept me from going any further, the 
damage was done.</p><p>I’d defiled an innocent girl because I was too caught up in myself to 
believe a fan of mine couldn’t want that. I’d become Anh, only I didn’t need alcohol to 
enable me, and I’d planned to go even further. That was the truth I didn’t want to face. I 
struggled to justify things to myself to avoid coming to this realization. No one wants to 
admit to herself that she could have become something so terrible and done such a deed, but 
I was headed inevitably towards that conclusion. I was just desperately trying to keep 
myself away from it through flimsy rationalizations.</p><p>In the end though, I didn’t quite 
get the chance to come to this conclusion completely on my own. I’m not sure whether it was 
better things turned out as they did or not; if nothing else, it got me there sooner. But 
I’m not sure if that was quite necessary for what happened later. Well, I guess I’m getting 
a bit ahead of myself here.</p><p>You see, Haruka-san wasn’t the only one who chose not to 
leave me alone that day. A certain member of the faculty, Miss Maria Graceburt, had also 
heard of what had happened. Being the local disciplinarian, she naturally took it upon 
herself to handle me. Her fondness for making a surprising entrance led her to waiting until 
just after I’d passed her office while on my way back from classes to appear in the hallway, 
clearing her throat angrily behind me.</p><p>I’d never been in trouble with Miss Maria 
before, but I knew that sound full well, and it was obviously directed at me. I nervously 
turned around to face her, giving her a polite bow. “Miss Maria, what can I…” I started to 
say.</p><p>“Miss Viola.” Her voice was perfectly steady, which somehow made it all the more 
frightening. I’d heard her disciplining other students, and she rarely had any qualms about 
showing her anger. It was disquieting, to say the least, to think how angry she must have 
been that there wasn’t even a tone of voice appropriate for it. “We need to 
speak.”</p><p>With that, she withdrew to her office. Unlike the younger girls who had to 
face her wrath, she at least spared me the dignity of being allowed to walk in under my own 
power, rather than being dragged by the ear. Or perhaps she simply wished for me to prolong 
my own torment in waiting for her verdict by staying out in the hallway longer of my own 
accord. It didn’t really matter to me, though. To be honest, even facing Miss Maria’s wrath, 
my mind was still stuck on Natsuki. I was still more worried about what I’d done to her and 
her reaction than whatever punishment I might face for it.</p><p>And so I didn’t waste any 
time in following Miss Maria into her office. I kept my head low as I entered – not because 
I was trying to avoid offending her, but simply because I felt low – and so I didn’t notice 
there was another person in the room until I sat down beside her. I glanced over at her, 
finding that she appeared to be close to my age, but she was wearing the uniform of a Wind 
University student. She also seemed to have an air of maturity about her, as if she’d had an 
Otome’s training. That certainly didn’t apply to her hairstyle, though, which appeared as if 
she simply let it go whichever way it preferred. It certainly wouldn’t pass Miss Maria’s 
standards. Deep within me, I idly acknowledged that she was pretty cute, but that small 
voice was quickly drowned out by another which said that she was nothing compared to 
Natsuki.</p><p>“I apologize for this, Miss Chrysant,” Miss Maria said to the girl beside me. 
“I don’t know what’s keeping Miss Armitage, but I really need to handle this now. Would you 
mind waiting outside for a few minutes? The cafeteria is just down the hall if you wish to 
sit down.”</p><p>“Oh, uh, don’t worry about it,” the girl next to me said as she got up. She 
gave Miss Maria a graceful bow, and then cast a quick glance in my direction. I wasn’t sure 
what emotion might have been behind her glance, as I dropped my gaze as soon as I saw her 
looking at me. I was determined to remain in my own world as much as possible. “I think I’ll 
just meet Armitage-san in the hallway, so don’t worry if she doesn’t come in. She shouldn’t 
be much longer.”</p><p>“Of course,” Miss Maria said, nodding her head to the girl as she 
slipped out the door. Miss Maria then turned to me as she sat down behind her desk. She 
stared at me for a few long minutes before she spoke. “I assume you know why I asked you 
here, Miss Viola. Needless to say, I’m very disappointed in you.”</p><p>I only gave a small 
nod in response. What would have been the point in saying anything? I could barely even 
justify my actions to myself anymore. After it became clear to her that I didn’t have 
anything to say, Miss Maria continued. “I had quite high hopes for you,” she said with a 
sigh. “Not simply as an Otome, but as a person of character as well. I didn’t think anyone 
would be able to rein in Miss Lu, but somehow you managed it. I was quite impressed with how 
you handled her last year when you learned what she’s like under the influence. It’s just 
unfortunate that you’ve been on a decline ever since that moment. Although you may have 
mellowed her a bit, Miss Lu seems to have had much more of an effect on you, in much the 
wrong direction.”</p><p>I still didn’t have anything I could really say in response to this, 
but my mind flashed back once more to the girl I was a year ago. I imagined my younger self 
being victim to my molestation in place of Natsuki, and I knew that I would certainly have 
hated it, though perhaps not as much as Natsuki had. Had I really changed so much that I 
could have done something so terrible? What had happened to me…? The image of Natsuki’s hurt 
face formed in my mind’s eye and stayed there, haunting me. The thought of her pain finally 
broke through my resistance, and I could feel all my regret pouring out. I no longer cared 
about trying to excuse my behavior. I dropped my head down as I mentally cried, <i>Forgive 
me, Natsuki…</i></p><p>“Shizuru?” The word caught me off guard and snapped me out of my 
thoughts. Both Miss Maria’s sudden informality and the gentle tone of her voice were so 
uncharacteristic of her that I completely forgot about Natsuki as I stared up at the woman 
incredulously. She looked back at me with concern in her eyes for a moment, but then she 
reverted back to her normal self.</p><p>“You understand that sexual harassment is a very 
serious matter, Miss Viola,” she said. I nodded hesitantly at this, still stunned by the 
rapid changes in her mood. “If I felt it necessary, I could have you expelled for this.” 
Perhaps that statement would have shocked me if I were in a more normal state, but it didn’t 
faze me much at that time. “But I think you’re genuinely better than this, and I can see 
that you truly regret your actions, so I don’t think such drastic measures are 
necessary.”</p><p>I felt a bit of relief at that, but it oddly wasn’t simply because I 
wasn’t going to get expelled. For some reason, I think I was just relieved that Miss Maria 
could see that I regretted it. I didn’t want to be a person who could do something like that 
without regret. I wished I wasn’t a person who could do that at all, but it was too late for 
that. At least I could work towards being better in the future.</p><p>Miss Maria was silent 
for a bit, presumably waiting for me to say something. I honestly didn’t have much I could 
think of to say, though. When it was clear that I’d have to say something or we’d sit here 
forever, I decided to broach a subject I’d been a bit concerned about, hoping that Miss 
Maria’s information network might be able to give me a little clue. I dropped my gaze from 
Miss Maria and tentatively said, “Miss Maria… do you know how Kruger-san is 
doing?”</p><p>“Not well.” A sharp pain hit my heart at that revelation. “She hasn’t left her 
room all day. If I could hazard a guess, I’d say she’s suffering from a mix of heartbreak, 
disillusionment, and betrayal. She’ll pull through, but this is one of those 
character-forming times that could really affect who she grows up to be, depending on what 
happens in the next few days.”</p><p>“Oh,” I said. It felt to me that Miss Maria was hinting 
to me that I should do something, but I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to talk to Natsuki 
easily. Talking to me was likely the last thing she wanted to do.</p><p>Miss Maria waited a 
bit, and when it became clear I had nothing more to say, she continued, “Alright, Miss 
Viola, I’ve decided on your punishment for this incident. You are tasked with gaining Miss 
Kruger’s forgiveness for what you’ve done to her. Until you do, you are prohibited from 
selecting a heya gakkari.”</p><p>I looked up at Miss Maria in surprise. This seemed 
unusually lenient coming from her, even if it did turn out to be impossible to get Natsuki’s 
forgiveness. I was expecting something much more extreme, such as having to clean the campus 
grounds alone for a week. Why was she being nice to me, particularly for something as severe 
as this? “Um, is that it?” I asked tentatively, hoping I wasn’t calling more down upon 
myself.</p><p>“You think I’m being lenient, Miss Viola?” Miss Maria said, an eyebrow raised. 
“If you feel you deserve more punishment, then feel free to discipline yourself however you 
see fit, but this is all I have for you. You may leave.”</p><p>It took me a while to 
understand just why Miss Maria chose that particular brand of punishment. Only when I had 
responsibilities of my own, working alongside of her, did it finally make sense. Her goal 
wasn’t to punish me. Obviously, part of her intentions were to help Natsuki get through this 
better, but that wasn’t all. She wanted to help me grow, and she knew that simple punishment 
would never have done that. I had to learn to fix the problems I created, and I had to be 
humbled a little.</p><p>To gain Natsuki’s forgiveness, I’d have to admit that I was wrong. 
I’d have to drop the façade of Shizuru-oneesama and approach her as simply Shizuru. The 
trick though was in figuring out just who Shizuru was. In a year of playing the role of an 
idol, I’d forgotten myself. Natsuki had seen a glimmer of who I really was behind that 
façade – even though nowadays she thinks that she was just being dumb and oblivious, my 
protestations to the contrary – and I would have to bring that person out again for her 
sake.</p><p>But I hadn’t figured all of that out quite then. I’d need some more time to 
think to myself before I’d come to that conclusion. And so, still confused by Miss Maria’s 
leniency, I hesitantly got up and made my way to the door. I half expected her to drop some 
extra pronouncement on me while I was on my way out, but none was coming. I let out a sigh 
of relief when the door to her office finally closed behind me, only to be stunned out of my 
thoughts by a yell from down the hall: “Gah! Leave me alone already! Festering me is no way 
to convince me to select you as my heya-gakkari!”</p><p>“<i>Festering”?</i> The commotion at 
the end of the hall seemed to die down for a moment as the coral targeted by this outburst 
tried to puzzle this one out. After a moment, the answer came from a figure who I’d once 
more completely failed to notice right beside me: “Um, do you mean ‘pestering,’ 
Armitage-san?”</p><p>“What? Of course I…” Haruka trailed off at this. Discreetly glancing 
over at Haruka, I noticed that a slight blush had formed in her cheeks and she was nervously 
scratching the back of her neck. “Er, you would be Yukino Chrysant, I guess… I’m sorry I’m 
late, you see I…”</p><p>Yukino gave a pleasant chuckle. “Don’t worry about it,” she said, as 
she started walking towards Haruka.</p><p>I chose this moment to take my leave, deciding 
that it wouldn’t be proper to eavesdrop on the two of them any longer, whatever they might 
be up to. I had quite enough to think about on my own. I was getting worried about how 
Natsuki was doing, and I figured it would be best if I at least apologized to her. I 
couldn’t expect her to forgive me just yet, but I had to do what I could for her. The 
distraction provided by Haruka gone, I had started to once again feel the pain over how I’d 
hurt her.</p><hr><p><i>Never again. I swore that back then, didn’t I? I’d do whatever I 
could to avoid hurting Natsuki like that again… but I’ve failed. I didn’t think about how 
what I was doing was really affecting her. She has every right to be mad. I just hope she’ll 
be able to forgive me again…</i></p><p>Shizuru let out a sigh as she reached to the 
nightstand on the side of their bed and looked at the picture of Natsuki she kept framed 
there. Her mind superimposed the expression of hurt she’d seen on her beloved’s face that 
morning over the smiling visage in the photograph. She reached a hand out instinctively to 
trace along Natsuki’s face in the picture, trying to wipe away the pain.</p><p>“I’m sorry, 
Natsuki…” she said to the picture, wishing her love were there to hear it herself. With a 
sigh, she allowed herself to drop down to the bed. After a few moments sitting there, she 
laid back, catching sight of a silhouette standing in the doorway as she did so. Her heart 
started pounding rapidly in her chest as she recognized Natsuki and wondered how the woman 
had gotten in without her noticing. Had she been that engrossed in her own thoughts? But, 
no, that wasn’t what mattered now. They needed to talk, to get this sorted out, 
to…</p><p>“And for that, love…” Natsuki said, walking into the room. The tone of her voice 
surprised Shizuru. There didn’t seem to be any anger left in it. If anything, Natsuki seemed 
to be a bit pleased. When Natsuki got up onto the bed and climbed on top of Shizuru, the 
smirk on her face confirmed this. “…I’ll be merciful.”</p>
