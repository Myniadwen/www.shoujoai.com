1997

Fujino Shizuru held a classmate of hers, a boy who had been picking on 
the others lately, in a tight headlock behind Momoyama Elementary 
School. He struggled against her as his face began swell red and purple 
as the blood was prevented from properly circulating. His fingernails 
dug into her arm, leaving noticeable marks behind. Other children were 
cheering her on in hopes that that bully might learn his lesson. She 
didn&#39;t really care about the rest of them. He&#39;d insulted her, and he had 
to pay the consequence.

She had just transferred in from Kyoto International&#39;s grade school at 
her father&#39;s request only to run into this fool and his taunting of how 
&#39;the foreigner spoke funny.&#39; She spoke Japanese well enough, but she 
hadn&#39;t taken to it as quickly as she had her mother&#39;s Russian. The 
distinct Kyoto accent that practically defined her as an adult hadn&#39;t 
manifested at the time. Her mother-like aunt spoke fluent Russian and 
English. Her father spoke the Kyoto-ben flavor of Japanese. Shizuru&#39;s 
accent, as a child, was all over the place and the source of endless 
harassment.

So, when she had been talking to a fellow classmate, and accidentally 
slipped into Russian in her enthusiasm, that boy had laughed at the top 
of his lungs. &quot;Stupid Fujino and her Commie talk. Get the hell back to 
Siberia, white girl.&quot;

Which left them in their current position &#150; Shizuru with her teeth 
gritted in rage and mercilessly strangling him. When she had thought it 
enough, she let go and promptly kicked him roughly to the ground, 
marching away with a snarl still on her face. He began to wail loudly, 
like an infant, and finally caught the attention of various attendants 
on the playground. They snatched Shizuru up and brought her to the 
principal, where she was taken home by her father after he arrived.

The ride home was essentially silent, Fujino Shin only giving her one 
warning. &quot;Shizuru, when someone insults you, physically reacting to it 
will only get you into trouble. At all times, you should attempt to 
ignore it and maintain peace. If you cannot, then use your words and 
your wit. Only when someone you care about is threatened should you ever 
resort to physical action.&quot;

That was essentially the calm before the storm, because it only got 
worse after that. Shin only had the time to bring Shizuru home before 
heading back to work as his lunch break concluded. That meant that she 
was going to spend the rest of the day at home with her nanny. The worse 
came when her aunt Kaori, Shin&#39;s domineering sister, came by after 
hearing what had happened.

The woman, very Japanese in looks and very traditional in her etiquette, 
expected Shizuru to be nothing less than an aristocratic lady at the 
tender age of six. Shizuru sat before her, looking up at the cold and 
emotionless woman, waiting for a harsh lecture. It certainly came, 
spoken in almost venomous Japanese, disappointment and perhaps malice 
dripping from her tongue.

&quot;What a despicable child, to behave in such a manner. The Fujino women 
represent grace and dignity. Don&#39;t you know how far back our family line 
goes? We have a reputation to uphold, lest we become even more of a 
mockery. It was bad enough having my brother walk around Kyoto with that 
Russian giant of a wife your mother was, towering over him like that. 
The last thing we need is for you to act like... like... the Cossack 
barbarian you are, getting into fights. You repress all that anger and 
bury it before you cause your relatives grief,&quot; Kaori hissed.

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; A voice called. Tanya Dragunova, the only aunt Shizuru 
cared for, walked into the room, having arrived after also hearing word. 
The expression on her face was one of livid rage, having never enjoyed 
any of the Fujino family members save for her brother-in-law. She 
marched toward Kaori but halted. &quot;Shizuru, go to your room for a 
minute.&quot;

Kaori narrowed her eyes into slits, and Shizuru hesitated for a moment. 
Tanya&#39;s gaze gradually incorporated enough authority to where Shizuru 
moved willingly, fleeing up the stairs. She tossed her backpack into her 
room, and slammed the door, pretending to have gone inside. In reality, 
she stood in the hallway, eavesdropping on the fight that was about to 
occur. After several moments of loaded silence, Tanya continued.

&quot;Who the hell do you think you are talking to her like that, suka?&quot; 
Shizuru heard, picking up on the Russian word for &#39;bitch.&#39; &quot;You are not 
her mother.&quot;

&quot;Neither are you,&quot; Kaori countered. &quot;Since you seem to be incapable of 
teaching her proper manners - not that I blame you given your own 
behavior - it is my responsibility to see that that damn mix can be 
salvaged into a suitable family member.&quot;

Tanya tightened her fists. &quot;If you want to rear a child, you should stop 
being so unnaturally fixated on your brother, actually find a man who 
can stand you, and have some offspring of your own. Until then, stop 
trying to take Milena&#39;s place.&quot;

&quot;How very hypocritical of you, Dragunova. It just goes to prove that 
with those kind of genes, that girl will be nothing but a walking 
disgrace to my family. I don&#39;t know what my brother saw in that whore of 
a sister of yo--&quot;

She was cut off. &quot;Keep talking and I&#39;ll see to it that you walk out of 
here with at least one black eye, you conceited fool. I don&#39;t care what 
you say about me, but if you insult my sister I will not hesitate to 
make sure you learn never to do it again.&quot;

Kaori tightened her jaw, glared, and turned to walk out of the room. She 
stormed through the door, yet shut it delicately behind her. Tanya 
remained stationary for many moments after she had left, glad the 
Japanese woman was too &#39;refined&#39; for an actual fight. Dammit, she didn&#39;t 
have Milena&#39;s patience or tact. Every time Kaori or one of Shin&#39;s other 
relatives came at her with such insults, she only wanted to prove them 
right. Her sister had brushed them all aside for the sake of 
togetherness, acting as if nothing hurt her &#150; all because of the love 
she had for her husband. Tanya didn&#39;t have that connection. She remained 
only for her niece.

Tanya turned and headed up the stairs, pausing as she saw Shizuru 
standing there, calm as could be despite what had just happened &#150; a 
miniature version of her mother. It stung. &quot;You don&#39;t like minding me, 
do you? I didn&#39;t want you to hear that.&quot;

The six year old version of Shizuru simply stared at her, not moving, 
and not speaking. Perhaps she would just have to get used to being 
insulted &#150; at school as well as in the home. She was only then reaching 
an age of understanding the disdain the Fujino family held for her. 
Tanya, struggling with her own inner emotions, dropped to her knees and 
pulled Shizuru into a firm hug, breaking only to plant a kiss onto the 
girl&#39;s forehead.

&quot;You are not a disgrace to anyone,&quot; Tanya gently spoke in Russian. 
&quot;There is nothing for you to be ashamed of, regardless of whatever 
anyone may say. They&#39;re wrong. You are a wonderful child, Shizuru, and 
I&#39;m proud of how strong you are to handle everything.&quot;

Shizuru&#39;s Russian came more freely in those days, before she had been 
fully submersed into Japanese. She replied in kind. &quot;Insults don&#39;t mean 
anything, then.&quot;

&quot;No, they don&#39;t. You know what? If anyone insults or hurts you, then 
it&#39;s just proof that you don&#39;t need them. Their opinions shouldn&#39;t 
matter to you.&quot; Seeing Shizuru&#39;s gaze fixed on the floor, Tanya lifted 
her chin and said, &quot;The real world can be a scary place, so know that no 
matter what happens, I&#39;ll always love you.&quot;

That was something she would certainly always know. She grew up with her 
distinctly Japanese eyes and nose and with her well defined Russian 
face, teased for a good long while in elementary school by classmate and 
Fujino relative alike. Even after her father, the only decent Fujino of 
the group, died of what many thought was heartache over his lost wife, 
Shizuru let the insults slide off her. School had always been hell. By 
the time they had gotten bored with taunting her about her ethnicity, 
they had simply regarded her as that social outcast shy girl.

She was never rude. She was never gruff. She did not glare or fight, 
like a certain someone. Shizuru just smiled and tried her best to be 
kind, her voice becoming distinctly Kyoto-ben as she got older. When she 
had transferred to Fuuka during her junior high days after being awarded 
the same scholarship the other HiMEs received, things changed 
dramatically. She became... popular. That accent and that family name 
earned her a high ranking with the strangers she now attended classes 
with. She earned a fanclub, for god sakes. It had honestly quite scared 
her at first, but after practice, it became tolerable to be the center 
of attention. She never let anyone see her weak side.

Until, of course, she met someone who reminded her very much of herself 
&#150; angry, alone, and bitter. It was in those common personality traits, 
even if Shizuru&#39;s remained buried, that the two became friends. The 
first genuine friend either had, really.

- - -

She was still bewildered by what had happened. In fact, she&#39;d been taken 
so off guard by Shizuru&#39;s sudden departure and request to be alone that 
she&#39;d been having a shitty week all together. Natsuki was lost in her 
own thoughts, pondering just what the hell could have happened. Tanya 
hadn&#39;t said anything. Shizuru wasn&#39;t returning calls or going to the 
door. So, what in god&#39;s name was wrong? Was she mad at Natsuki or not?

The biker found herself, in her state of unrest, succumbing to an old 
habit. She was skipping her gym class. It was amazing what one mention, 
a lie, of &#39;women&#39;s troubles&#39; could do in terms of getting out of doing 
anything. She got a note, and was excused. She got her points for the 
day. Nothing to worry about except her friendship. She walked through a 
barren campus, all the students inside classrooms.

Natsuki sigh as she walked. It was either something that she failed to 
notice around them that had gotten Shizuru upset, or just... that damn 
relationship thing. She really didn&#39;t want to deal with or think about 
that. If that was the case, what the hell could she do about it? Was she 
just going to have to fuck her in order to even remain her friend? Maybe 
it could all be fixed by a long discussion. Not that Natsuki could even 
talk to her right now.

She walked behind the playing fields and into the very vast field that 
was next to the Academy, content with being alone until she saw a 
familiar young girl sitting underneath a tree. The blonde child was 
reading a book, an open bag of some snack food or another resting next 
to her. Natsuki furrowed her brows and approached from the side. Her 
usual guardian was not there to even watch her.

The girl looked up as she approached, and once she was close enough, 
Natsuki said, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you in class?&quot;

Alyssa stared at her for a moment, perhaps wondering why she of all 
people was lecturing her about cutting class. &quot;Why aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;I have an excuse.&quot; Well, it wasn&#39;t a total lie. She waved the slip the 
teacher had written as proof of her claim.

The ten year old moved one eyebrow up in mild curiosity, but said 
nothing further on Natsuki&#39;s own absence from her course, preferring to 
just answer and leave it at that. &quot;Class bores me. The teacher keeps 
taking my books away when I&#39;m trying to read.&quot;

Natsuki&#39;s eyes darted down to the book. Certainly thick, and certainly 
not a novel of any kind. It was an academic book one would see alongside 
someone attending university, not a ten year old elementary student. The 
title looked like it was something about engineering and electronics, of 
all things. The girl was too smart for her own good. No wonder she was 
absolutely bored. Searrs had crammed eighteen or more academic years 
worth of information into her young mind, and then she was expected to 
sit there with the other ten year olds and learn about things she&#39;d 
already covered?

Natsuki sat down on the grass in front of her. &quot;Yeah, well, it used to 
bore me too, and look what happened. I got held back. So let&#39;s not have 
you go down that road. You should try to see if you can&#39;t dual enroll 
with the high school or something. It&#39;ll actually, you know, challenge 
you.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Alyssa said. She gently picked up a packet of ketchup from 
her side and smeared it over french fries already laden with the same 
sauce. Natsuki made a face as Alyssa plopped a saturated fry into her 
mouth. Gross.

&quot;Where&#39;s Miyu? Isn&#39;t it dangerous for you to hang around by yourself?&quot; 
Natsuki inquired.

&quot;Miyu is in class, maintaining her cover. She doesn&#39;t know I&#39;m out, 
though I&#39;m quite capable of looking out for myself,&quot; Alyssa replied, 
then leaned in with a small smile. &quot;You won&#39;t tell on me, will you?&quot;

&quot;I will if you keep skipping. You&#39;re going to your next class,&quot; Natsuki 
ordered. &quot;Who do you have for a teacher, anyway?&quot;

&quot;Murata-sensei,&quot; Alyssa said, referring to the elderly woman who also 
instructed a few courses at the junior high. Natsuki had been in a class 
of hers once before, and instantly found herself shivering at the 
memory. No wonder Alyssa wasn&#39;t enjoying school.

&quot;I see now. That old hag sent me to detention more times in one week 
than all my other teachers have during my entire time here. She&#39;s 
offended if you breathe,&quot; Natsuki recalled, thinking back on her 
mandatory class with the woman. &quot;I... had to take her for band. They 
require it at junior high.&quot;

This seemed to catch Alyssa&#39;s attention, who laughed almost dryly as she 
pictured Natsuki playing, well, anything. &quot;Oh, yeah? What did you get 
conned into playing?&quot;

She looked away, slightly embarrassed. Band was never her strong suit. 
Akane played the clarinet with great skill. Shizuru was an expert with 
the piano. But Natsuki? &quot;Um, lots of things. I started with the oboe, 
then moved to a violin, then Murata-sensei finally gave up and just gave 
me a drum. Because I could hit something. I really have no musical 
aptitude.&quot;

Alyssa chuckled as she glanced down at her book again. &quot;I&#39;ve heard.&quot;

Damn the legend of the karaoke party and all those involved with 
spreading the tale (Tokiha would pay). It had become well known around 
campus, and every once and a while some asshole would come up to her and 
ask to see her in that god awful costume or ask her to sing. She gave 
the child a small sigh, but said nothing on the matter. Alyssa smiled a 
bit, amused be her discomfort, and changed the subject.

&quot;I heard Shizuru-sama&#39;s aunt took her to Moscow as a graduation present. 
Is that true?&quot; Alyssa asked, bringing up the one person Natsuki had been 
trying to not concentrate on for at least five minutes. Thanks a lot, 
blondie.

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;That must have been a nice trip, seeing another part of the world like 
that,&quot; Alyssa commented. &quot;Not many people have a chance to ever travel 
that far away. What did you get her?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; I was supposed to get her something for graduation?

Alyssa blinked. &quot;Nothing? At all?&quot;

Natsuki shifted where she sat, suddenly uncomfortable and paranoid. &quot;I 
didn&#39;t know I had to!&quot;

Alyssa slapped herself in the face. &quot;Are you not her best friend? Who 
else is going to make a fuss out of a rather large life milestone like a 
high school graduation? You nitwit, go get her something. I lived my 
life in a laboratory and I still manage to know that. This is sad.&quot;

A ten year old was calling her a nitwit. Perfect. She gripped her pant 
legs, wondering just what the hell she was supposed to get. She hated 
buying gifts. She seldom did, and usually it was only when she had to. 
Which was apparently now. Had she made a fool of herself by not doing 
anything? Shizuru always bought her things. The leather jacket wrapped 
around her torso was proof of that. Natsuki sighed. Still pondering, she 
stood up, and pointed to the school.

&quot;We have two minutes before the warning bell goes off. I&#39;ll walk you 
back,&quot; Natsuki almost grumbled.

&quot;Not even a card, Natsuki?&quot; The blonde just had to push it, staring at 
her with those icy eyes. She was almost as bad as Mai. A short, blonde, 
evil mastermind version of Mai. &Uuml;bermai.

Natsuki bent down, grabbed one of those fries absolutely covered in far 
too much ketchup, and shoved one roughly into Alyssa&#39;s mouth, silencing 
her for the next several moments. &quot;I liked you better when you were 
trying to kill me. Now quit making me feel bad or you&#39;re getting locked 
in the nearest daycare with the rest of the tots.&quot;

- - -

Kuga Natsuki was efficient and highly competent when it came to three 
things: motorcycles, combat, and cooking with condiments. With 
everything else, she was clueless. For several days (all with no contact 
from the Kyoto stealth ninja) she struggled with what exactly she could 
do or buy for a belated graduation present. A card was for sissies. 
Flowers were also for sissies and could deliver the wrong message. She 
supposed it would have to be something meaningful. Then, just as April 
was about to end, she finally made a choice.

She pulled out her phone, went to her list, and selected Fujino from a 
grand total of five choices (Mai, Fujino, Afro, Yuuki, and Tanya). After 
a few rings, it actually picked up. &quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Are you home?&quot;

&quot;Yes, why?&quot;

&quot;Stay there.&quot; She hung up.

The ride to Shizuru&#39;s apartment was quick and familiar. Natsuki took the 
nearest lift, holding a large (but unwrapped, because that was a skill 
she did not have) box in her hands. She shifted it to one hand, wrapping 
her arm under it, as she approached Shizuru&#39;s door and knocked three 
quick times. The door opened, revealing someone she hadn&#39;t seen for days 
on end, looking quite... normal, despite having been missing in action 
for so long. Shizuru looked on in surprise before moving to the side, 
allowing the biker to enter.

Natsuki set the gift down on the couch, and then turned back around to 
face the other woman. &quot;Ah, I&#39;m glad you finally picked up. Is everything 
all right with you? What happened?&quot;

Shizuru set down her cup of tea on the counter and gently shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m 
quite all right now. I apologize for running off with no explanation and 
then hiding myself away. You were probably worried. I just... saw 
someone in the crowd around us that I did not want to see. Someone from 
the Carnival, let&#39;s say. Other than that, I&#39;ve just been enjoying time 
by myself.&quot;

It was partially the truth, but she figured that shouting out all of the 
issues regarding their relationship would have not been productive. 
Natsuki, on the other hand, sighed a bit in relief, glad that it was not 
apparently anything she had done, as far as she knew. That must have 
meant someone Shizuru encountered during the destruction of the First 
District. The others involved in the Carnival were mutual friends.

&quot;I see,&quot; Natsuki said, not wanting to press the issue. She shifted her 
feet. &quot;Since you were in Russia for a while, and I haven&#39;t gotten to see 
you much, I didn&#39;t really get a chance to give you anything for 
graduation, and, well, I&#39;m horrible with gifts... so...&quot;

Okay, she was making an ass of herself now. She flinched and grabbed 
hold of the generic, unmarked box, offering it to Shizuru, who looked at 
her in surprise. The Kyoto woman daintily grabbed either side and 
hoisted it up before putting it down on the end table next to her, 
opening it up. Natsuki held her breath, not entirely sure how this would 
go. Shizuru removed the standard foam keeping the object protected, 
tossing it aside, and pulled out something black and red. It&#39;s surface 
shined underneath the lights above.

A... motorcycle helmet &#150; the exact kind that Natsuki wore, right down to 
the color. Shizuru looked at her, not sure what to make of it, subtly 
requesting explanation. Kuga fixed her eyes on the wall behind her, 
unable to look her in the eyes. &quot;It&#39;s for when you and I go out riding 
on the Ducati. Your own, so neither of us have to worry about cracking 
our skulls open. We haven&#39;t really been out much on the thing lately, 
so... you want to go? I can swing by my apartment on the way out of town 
and give you one of my other suits to wear, if you want.&quot;

Shizuru was quiet for a moment, which was doing nothing for the breathe 
Natsuki was holding in anticipation. Then, as she felt herself ready to 
pass out, Shizuru managed a small smile and said, &quot;Sure. I&#39;ll grab my 
coat.&quot;

She put the helmet down for a slight moment to retrieve a coat for the 
ride to Natsuki&#39;s apartment (after which, the promised biker suit would 
give her well enough protection against the wind). As Shizuru rummaged 
through her closet, Natsuki let her eyes wander along the counter. 
Coins, keys to her car, and a slip of paper that had only one line 
written on it.

&#39;Aya: 078-475-9836&#39;

Natsuki found herself staring at it for several long moments, knowing 
full well what it probably meant, but not letting it sink in. So perhaps 
Shizuru had spent her alone time... not so alone. It was a good thing, 
wasn&#39;t it? Shizuru moved behind her, and she turned around quickly, 
hoping that she hadn&#39;t been caught. If she had, Shizuru wasn&#39;t saying 
anything. The woman picked up her new helmet and slipped it over her 
head, fastening the straps underneath.

&quot;Ready when you are,&quot; Shizuru said. Something felt hollow, but after 
having spent about a week apart, Kuga felt no need to complain, should 
she just ruin it more.

The pair exited the apartment and made the quick run to Natsuki&#39;s, where 
Shizuru ran up to change. The woman returned in a leather, form fitting 
suit that was similar to the one Natsuki had on. It fit, though it was a 
might tighter on her in certain areas where Kuga was lacking assets. And 
for a moment, she let her eyes linger, not really thinking about what 
she was doing. Shizuru was beautiful as always, but she looked much 
better when she smiled.

Sliding back on the back, she took hold of Natsuki&#39;s waist, giving her a 
light hit on the side to indicate she was ready. Natsuki put down her 
visor again and gave the engine a roar before taking off down the 
street, not minding the speed limit. As always, she felt safe to do so 
with Shizuru, who had long since gotten used to such things. When they 
got to the last stop light before hitting the freeway out of town, 
Shizuru spoke up.

&quot;Where are you taking me?&quot; She asked.

&quot;Kyoto.&quot;

Before Shizuru had time to say anything further, they were off again, 
heading onto the freeway and getting up to the proper speed before going 
even faster. It was very much like the old days, when they use to just 
drive around for hours after school, Natsuki taking her all around 
Fuuka, showing her where her own favorite (or infamous) scenic locations 
were. Very seldom had they made the trip to and from Kyoto. So, as 
Natsuki rocketed down the freeway, weaving between cars, it felt very 
nostalgic and welcome after all that had happened.

Shizuru&#39;s hands were gripping her stomach, but not with the usual 
tenacity and possession they tended to have. It was a loose grasp, 
Shizuru only touching her to prevent from falling off. Kuga frowned 
underneath her helmet. While some things always remained the same, she 
guessed, some things certainly changed.

Aya, huh?

Natsuki accelerated further, feeling the wind toss her hair around. 
Shizuru&#39;s grip tightened. Well, if that was the only way to do it, so be 
it. For about they rode on, Shizuru eventually telling Natsuki to get 
off the freeway and take a more scenic route. She did so, taking a more 
country road up through wooded areas outside the city. Again following 
Shizuru&#39;s instructions, she headed up to a hill, where she parked the 
bike. The pair got off, Shizuru walking forward, up further, leaving 
Natsuki to catch up. She watched her move, her mind still... slightly 
troubled.

Whatever.

Natsuki finally moved, following Shizuru up the path. It opened up into 
a hill overlooking the city. They&#39;d been there once or twice before. 
Shizuru sat down on the grass, Natsuki joining her. The biker turned her 
gaze in Shizuru&#39;s direction, who seemed fixated on the city itself. &quot;You 
don&#39;t want to actually go down there?&quot;

Shizuru was silent for a bit, her focus never wavering, her eyes looking 
as if a thousand thoughts were running through her mind. She hadn&#39;t 
really felt comfortable in public since she saw that boy staring at her 
with that blank look at the restaurant. Who knew how many of the people 
who survived the attack and could easily point her out? Staying out of 
sight was for the best.

She turned to look at Natsuki then, offering her a reassuring smile. 
&quot;No, I think I&#39;d much rather watch it from afar, if you don&#39;t mind. It&#39;s 
more peaceful up here.&quot;

Shizuru watched as Natsuki turned her attention back to the city below, 
leaning back and relaxing. Perhaps if it had been earlier, she would 
have attempted to lean against her after saying something melodramatic 
to the point of being funny. Now, she kept her distance, keeping a few 
feet between them. She wasn&#39;t going to chase her anymore, but she would 
try, she would try very hard, to remain her friend. She only hoped that 
Tanya had spoken a word of truth to her.

After a half an hour of silently watching the city, Shizuru stood and 
headed back to the bike, seeing dusk approach. &quot;Ara, you should let me 
drive us back.&quot;

Natsuki froze in her tracks, Shizuru looking back to see her childishly 
shaking her head as rapidly as possible. &quot;No damn way, not after you 
dinged up the very first one I had. It took weeks to get all the 
scratches out.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve gotten better since then,&quot; Shizuru argued. &quot;Didn&#39;t I make it down 
Fuuka&#39;s main street without difficulty a few months ago?&quot;

&quot;That was one little street. You&#39;re talking the freeway, now, and a hour 
of travel. I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Natsuki decided, gripping onto the keys.

Shizuru stared at her hand for just a few seconds before springing 
forward as if she were going to outright attack the biker. She went 
straight for the keys, but Kuga pulled back, not willing to release them 
so easily. Shizuru moved again, ducking behind and pinning Natsuki&#39;s 
hand against her back. The biker twisted around and moved forward, the 
wrestling match continuing with both girls protesting to each other&#39;s 
actions. At long last, Shizuru tripped Natsuki and sent her falling to 
the ground, the keys landing a foot or so away. Both scrambled to get to 
them in time, but it was only Fujino Shizuru who emerged victorious.

Wasting no time, she sprinted to the bike and climbed onto it, leaving 
Natsuki to ride on the poor bitch seat she&#39;d been traveling on for far 
too long. Natsuki stood, pouting and fearful about what was going to 
happen here. She sat on the rear of the bike, grabbing onto Shizuru 
tightly. There was a rule to be followed - take no chances when dealing 
with Fujino and machinery. Shizuru started the bike, and Natsuki 
practically sobbed, emitting a high pitched whine.

&quot;Oh, stop being such a baby,&quot; Shizuru said, and she revved the bike 
once. Natsuki&#39;s grip tightened further, her fingers threatening to leave 
bruises on Shizuru&#39;s stomach. Shizuru managed to turn the bike around 
and head back down the path with minor incident. So far, so good.

It was when they were ready to turn onto the road out of there that 
things went awry. Shizuru accelerated too fast, and put the bike into a 
wheelie. Despite her grip, Natsuki slid off the back and landed on the 
ground with a thud and a yelp. Shizuru landed the bike on the ground 
just fine, and turned around, watching Natsuki scramble to her feet.

&quot;Ara, hang on, will you?&quot; Shizuru said.

&quot;I&#39;m dumping all your damn tea down the sink when we get to back to your 
place,&quot; Natsuki hissed. She hopped back up on the back of the bike, 
still quite frightened about the rest of the journey home. She clung to 
Shizuru&#39;s side like her life depended on it. Which it very much did, 
knowing her. With a final deep breath, Natsuki told her to go ahead.

To Natsuki&#39;s amazement, the girl who appeared to be so opposite from her 
managed to expertly ride the bike back into Fuuka without anything bad 
happening. She was actually quite good at it, for someone who was never 
allowed to touch it until now. Natsuki&#39;s threat of dumping all her tea 
was nothing more than a bluff, and, after saying goodbye, the biker went 
home.

Shizuru stared down at her new helmet, resting her fingers on the edges 
of it. It hadn&#39;t been... too terrible. Putting the helmet into her 
closet, she thought that friendship might very well be salvageable if 
she kept her wits about her. The phone rang, and she meandered over to 
it, picking it up. She smirked just a tiny bit.
