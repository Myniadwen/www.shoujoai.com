<h1>Too Late (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leebot.html">Leebot</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/toolate-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><p>Dreams</p><hr><p>That was the night the dreams started. To this day, I don't know what 
was 
really behind them. Was it some god trying to give me a clue, or my own subconscious trying 
to do the same? Or was it just some coincidence the first few times, and my mind trying to 
keep it up afterwards? I prefer to think it was my subconscious, actually. That way I can 
give myself some credit for figuring it all out.</p><p>Everything is a lot clearer in 
hindsight, really. When I look back on everything, putting all that I knew and felt then 
together, the choice seems obvious. But I guess the difference is that these days, I know 
for sure what true love is. Back then, I was just a kid. I'd gotten engaged when I simply 
assumed I was in love, rather than knowing it for sure. At least it did set events in motion 
that allowed me to eventually reach that state.</p><p>What? You want to know who I'm talking 
about? Heh, well I'd like to tell you, but a certain <i>someone</i> who's making me write 
this things it would be better for the dramatic tension if we keep it a secret a bit longer. 
Shouldn't be too hard for you to figure out, though. Really. Think for just <i>one</i> 
second about it. Gah! I really should get back to the story, or Mai's going to break out her 
frying pan to keep me on track. Hah! I dare you to edit this out, Mai! Be just like you to 
hide the evidence.</p><p><b>Editor's Note:</b> Don't mind Natsuki. She's just mad that I ran 
out of mayonnaise. Oh, and dare met, so nyeh!</p><p>I don't think Shizuru noticed, but I was 
crying myself as I held her that night. I couldn't explain why I was brought to tears, but I 
think it was mostly seeing my best friend in that state which hurt me so much. I cared about 
her that much, I knew. Trying to figure things out beyond that was just hurting my brain 
even more, so I decided to put it off until the next day. I was hoping that sleep would help 
me sort things out in my mind. That was the primary purpose of it, after all, at least 
according to my psych professor.</p><p>Well, my dreams certainly had an impact on me, though 
they didn't do anything to clear things up at first. They really just confused me even more. 
Well, I shouldn't say “they,” it was really just one dream. One incredibly vivid and 
detailed dream, which had me waking up in tears. Although I'd gone to sleep cradling Shizuru 
against my chest while she wept, I found our positions reversed as I woke. I really needed 
her support then. I needed to feel her alive and beside me, to reassure myself that it was 
just a dream...</p><p>To be frank, though, it seemed too real to be just a dream. It all 
took place in another world which seemed to have all of its own rules and its own sort of 
magic, though it was filled with many people I recognized from my life – notably Shizuru. I 
was something called an “Otome” there, which is a warrior of some sort, I think. Only, I'd 
been seriously injured in battled and lost my eyesight. Oddly, in the dream, I still saw 
things from a kind of third-person perspective, so I knew more of what was going 
on.</p><p>At first, it had seemed like my life and career was ruined. I took a vacation back 
to my home to try to recover, and Shizuru came with me. In the dream, Shizuru and I were a 
couple, and very much in love. She was the only thing that kept me from falling into a 
suicidal depression. Her love saved me, and her devoted effort taught me how to live without 
my sight.</p><p>If I'd woken up there, her efforts for me in the dream and how comfortable 
being with her had seemed could easily have made an impact on my state of mind in the waking 
world. But from there, the dream took a turn for the worse. I started to feel weaker, and I 
couldn't keep up with our training. It was soon revealed that the poison which had initially 
blinded me had actually infected the rest of my body as well, and it was only just starting 
to take effect. Simply put, I was dying.</p><p>At this revelation, Shizuru did the most 
unbelievable thing. Any normal person in her position would have tended to me for the rest 
of my days, giving me all of her love. And when I'd passed, she mourn for quite some time, 
but eventually move on. Shizuru, however, went beyond all expectations. She just loved me 
too much, and so she couldn't even live without me.</p><p>And so Shizuru... Shizuru... well, 
I don't really know how to describe it, but she bonded herself to me in some way. By the 
technology of this world, that meant that her life was tied to mine, and mine to hers. She 
would rather die with me than live without. As she said, “I will go wherever Natsuki is.” I 
couldn't protest to this. I didn't know what the afterlife would entail, if there was any at 
all, but I knew then in my heart that it would be alright if Shizuru were with me. We didn't 
have to spend even a minute apart, through the end.</p><p>The bonding ceremony went through, 
and Shizuru and I spent our last days caring about nothing except each other. On the day 
when I knew the end was coming, I asked Shizuru to bring us out to the flower garden where 
we'd shared some of our most intimate moments. We shared our final words, our final 
admissions of love, before my ability to speak left me. In my mind, I wished only to be able 
to see her beautiful face once more, and somehow, through my sight finally returning through 
a small miracle or a quirk of my mind, my wish was granted. I passed away, seeing nothing 
but Shizuru, and her love brought her with me into the abyss.</p><p>I woke up to find myself 
being cradled in Shizuru's arms, my head buried in her chest. I'd nearly soaked through her 
shirt with my tears. It took me some time to gain control of myself. When I did, I gently 
parted myself from her, relieved to see that she was asleep with a peaceful smile on her 
face. Her dreams were happier than mine, apparently. Well, she deserved it, at least. She 
was the one who had to face so much sorrow in life, yesterday. She needed a break.</p><p>As 
I watched Shizuru sleeping, I reflected on my dream and realized a couple things. What I'd 
seen there was true love, no question about it. What I had with Reito, however... that 
couldn't compare. I wasn't in love with him. I might have loved him as a friend, but I 
couldn't marry him with just that. What I had with Shizuru was still too young to know if 
that was love. In the end, I just needed more time.</p><p>I let out a deep sigh. I pulled my 
right hand out from under Shizuru, and I removed my engagement ring from it. I put it in my 
pocket, resolving to talk with Reito about this as soon as possible. It was too soon to get 
married, at the very least. Before committing to that, I had to give Shizuru a 
chance.</p><p>I looked once again at Shizuru's sleeping form. She was so beautiful there. I 
had to feel her once more to reassure myself that we were both still alive. I stroked my 
hand along her side, and she let out a pleasant purr. I chuckled gently to myself. Leaning 
forward, I gave her a quick kiss on the nose and promised, “We'll talk soon, Shizuru. Please 
don't give up on me.”</p>
