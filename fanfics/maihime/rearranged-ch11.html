<h1>Rearranged (part 11 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/betsunii.html">betsunii83</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/rearranged-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Natsuki awoke with a start in the darkened hotel room. She sat up 
quickly, hands gripping the bedsheets beneath her. Her clothes were 
drenched in sweat and her breathing was coming out in quick, erratic 
pants. Swallowing the lump in her throat, she looked to her left and saw 
the sleeping form of the girl next to her.

She&#39;s ok. It was just a dream.

Her mind eased considerably, but she had to focus to calm her breathing 
and her racing heart. The dream, or rather, nightmare, was still fresh 
in her mind. Unlike most dreams she had, this time she could remember 
every horrible detail of the sequence of events that led to her sudden 
awakening. Just a dream, just a dream, just a dream. She reminded 
herself over and over until she finally felt semi-relaxed. Glancing at 
the clock, she noted that it was 3:47 am: much to early for her to wake 
up. It would take a while for her to be ready to return to sleep after 
having such a dream, however. Turning to Shizuru, she reached out a 
shaky hand and gently felt her side, finding reassurance in the warmth 
of her body.

Though it was not her intention, the older girl stirred to wakefulness 
at the contact and shifted around to face her.

&quot;Natsuki, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Shizuru asked, eyes still closed, her voice 
thick from sleeping.

&quot;I just woke up from a dream I was having, it&#39;s nothing,&quot; she replied, 
her voice quavering against her will.

Shizuru moved to rub her back comfortingly, drawing back suddenly when 
she touched her shirt.

&quot;Your clothes are soaking wet! Are you ok?&quot; She asked, the concern 
evident in her tone.

&quot;It was just a nightmare, don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Natsuki replied, not 
wanting Shizuru to get too worked up over it. The other girl was already 
sitting up, however, and inspecting her worriedly.

&quot;You&#39;re crying! What happened in your nightmare?&quot;

Surprised, Natuski felt of her face to discover that there were in fact 
tears falling down her cheeks and she didn&#39;t even realize it. Shizuru&#39;s 
arms wrapped around her and drew her close, tucking her head under her 
chin. Giving in to the comfort of her embrace, Natsuki pulled herself 
tighter to Shizuru&#39;s chest before taking a breath and telling her what 
had happened.

&quot;It-it was about last night, when we were running from your house. We 
were running and running across the yard to the gate, but it just kept 
getting further away from us. I kept trying to reach for your hand, but 
it was always just out of my reach. Somehow I felt that if I grabbed 
your hand, we would be able to escape. Then all of a sudden I heard a 
gunshot, just like last night, but this time I didn&#39;t feel it graze my 
arm. Something made me turn around and I saw you falling to the ground 
behind me as if&#151;as if the bullet had hit you. I ran to you and lifted 
you up and tried to shout your name, but no sound would come out of my 
throat. I kept shaking you and shaking you, but you wouldn&#39;t open your 
eyes, and there was blood everywhere, and&#151;&quot;

Natsuki choked back a sob, unable to continue. With soothing hands, 
Shizuru rubbed her back and rocked her gently.

&quot;Shhh, it&#39;s ok, I&#39;m right here, nothing happened to me. I&#39;m so sorry you 
had such a bad dream. It&#39;s over now, don&#39;t worry anymore.&quot;

More tears streamed down Natsuki&#39;s face as she squeezed her eyes shut. 
She listened to the steady beating of Shizuru&#39;s heart as her head lay 
against her chest. It&#39;s rhythmic sound was calming and she soon found 
herself being lulled to sleep. Still holding her close, Shizuru laid 
them both back down on the bed and began stroking her fingers through 
Natsuki&#39;s dark locks.

&quot;Shizuru?&quot;

&quot;Yes Natsuki?&quot;

&quot;I love you, I&#151;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do if anything ever happened to 
you.&quot;

&quot;I love you too. And don&#39;t worry, nothing is going to happen to me, I 
would never leave my Natsuki-chan.&quot;

Satisfied, Natsuki snuggled closer and drifted off to sleep.

                         *******************

The brightness inside the hotel room led to Natsuki&#39;s awakening the next 
morning. She felt very well-rested, and the fact that she was still 
enveloped in Shizuru&#39;s arms probably had something to do with that. 
Extracting an arm from around her waist, Natsuki raised her hand and 
lightly stroked the sleeping girl&#39;s face. Gently trailing fingertips 
over her graceful features, Natsuki was sure she&#39;d never seen a more 
beautiful woman than the one in front of her. Those slightly parted, 
perfect lips were just begging to be kissed, and Natsuki wasn&#39;t about to 
resist their calling.

Leaning in, she pressed tender kisses to her lips, delighting in their 
warmth and softness. Soon, she felt the intake of breath that signaled 
Shizuru&#39;s waking, which was soon followed by an appreciative moan as the 
older girl began to reciprocate the kiss. Their tongues twisted 
languidly together for a few moments before Natsuki drew back. Shizuru&#39;s 
eyes were still closed as she licked her lips, still caught up in the 
sensation of the kiss.

&quot;Mmmm...Good morning,&quot; Shizuru said in a husky voice, her eyes finally 
fluttering open.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Natsuki responded, her green eyes meeting Shizuru&#39;s in 
an affectionate gaze.

&quot;Did you end up sleeping well?&quot; Shizuru asked.

Natsuki nodded her head and smiled as she moved her hand to brush some 
errant strands of hair away from the other girl&#39;s face. It was such 
simple gestures, Shizuru thought, that revealed the depth of Natsuki&#39;s 
sensitive and caring nature. At times like these, she felt like she 
could melt into the younger girl&#39;s loving touch and lose herself in her 
caresses. For instance, at this moment, as Natsuki ran a hand up under 
her chemise and idly stroked the skin of her back while placing teasing 
kisses along her exposed collarbone. She couldn&#39;t help but close her 
eyes and let out a small moan.

&quot;Do you like this?&quot; Natsuki questioned playfully, obviously knowing the 
answer.

&quot;Yes, don&#39;t stop, please,&quot; Shizuru begged in response.

Grinning, Natsuki resumed her attentions, sliding a hand down to 
Shizuru&#39;s thigh and bringing it up to hook over her hip as she kissed 
her.

&quot;But you know,&quot; Natsuki said in between kisses, &quot;what will happen if I 
don&#39;t stop now.&quot;

&quot;Precisely.&quot;

With that, Natsuki rolled on top of Shizuru and kissed her even harder 
as she slid her hands beneath the girl&#39;s nightie and pulled it off of 
her. She immediately leaned down to taste one of her pink nipples and 
was rewarded with a gasp of pleasure as Shizuru bucked her hips up into 
her own. Thoroughly turned on from Natsuki&#39;s hot mouth on her chest, 
Shizuru pushed the girl up and grabbed the hem of her tank top before 
yanking it up over her head. She then brought her back down to return 
the favor, licking and sucking her breasts with fervor as Natsuki 
struggled to support herself on trembling arms.

When Natsuki finally sat up, her mind was reeling with passion and her 
breathing was heavy. She looked down to the girl below her and was 
stunned once again at how beautiful she was. Her tawny-colored hair was 
spread out on her pillow, framing her smiling face. Crimson eyes were 
alight with excitement, and pink lips swollen from kisses. Looking 
further down, her lovely chest was rising and falling with quick breaths 
and her hands were grasping her hips, thumbs tracing circles on her her 
bare skin. The vision was more than Natsuki could take, so she leaned 
down purposefully and kissed Shizuru&#39;s mouth. With every sweep of her 
tongue she tried to convey what she was feeling, the love that she felt 
must be emanating from within her out through every pore. She took her 
time, coaxing Shizuru with her lips and tongue until the other girl was 
breathless.

Leaning back, Natsuki smiled at the reaction she&#39;d elicited.

&quot;Wow,&quot; gasped Shizuru, &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve ever kissed me quite like 
that before. That was amazing.&quot;

Natsuki just grinned as she rolled off to Shizuru&#39;s side and rested her 
head on the pillow.

Looking concerned, Shizuru asked, &quot;Wait, we&#39;re not finished are we?&quot;

Suppressing a laugh, Natsuki replied, &quot;Actually, I was thinking we could 
take a shower now.&quot;

Shizuru looked very enthused at the idea. She was up from the bed and 
stripping off her underwear in an instant, saying, &quot;Ah yes, I&#39;ve often 
fantasized about taking you in the shower. Hurry up out of bed and come 
on!&quot;

Natsuki could only shake her head in amusement at her girlfriend&#39;s 
insatiability.

                       *********************

Emerging some time later from the bathroom in a cloud of steam, Natsuki 
stumbled out into the hotel room wrapped in a white towel. Collapsing on 
the bed, she melodramatically exclaimed, &quot;If we keep it up at this rate 
I&#39;ll be dead before the end of the week!&quot;

Shizuru exited the bathroom after her and giggled as she reclined next 
to her on the bed.

&quot;If I remember correctly, it was your idea, was it not, to take a shower 
together?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah, I know,&quot; she said, then paused, smirking. &quot;It was a pretty 
good idea wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

Shizuru only laughed, then suddenly pounced and began ticking her 
relentlessly until they were once again gasping for breath.

&quot;Ok,&quot; said Natsuki, &quot;we need to decide what we&#39;re going to do today.&quot;

&quot;I think I should definitely call my father today. I don&#39;t think we 
should have to keep staying in hiding like this, and I don&#39;t want you to 
have any more bad dreams because of it.&quot;

She picked up her cellphone and noticed there was a new voicemail.

&quot;It&#39;s from my father, he must have called while we were in the shower. 
I&#39;ll listen to it now.&quot;

Natsuki waited until she was finished, then looked at her expectantly to 
hear what he had said.

&quot;Well, first he said he was very sorry that we were fired upon by the 
security staff. He said he never authorized the use of weapons and that 
he was furious when he found out about it. Then he said to call him as 
soon as possible because he has a lot he wants to discuss with me.&quot;

&quot;Do you want to call him now? I could leave if you want.&quot;

&quot;No, you can stay. I may need your moral support.&quot;

&quot;Alright, if you&#39;re sure.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m sure.&quot; She took a deep breath, &quot;Here it goes.&quot;

Shizuru dialed her father&#39;s number and waited for him to answer. Soon he 
picked up, and Natsuki was able to hear his voice coming from the cell 
phone speaker as he answered, &quot;Hello Shizuru.&quot;

&quot;Hello father.&quot;

&quot;Are you alright, are you hurt?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re fine. You said you wanted to discuss some things with me?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I have come to the realization that you are quite determined about 
being involved with that girl.&quot;

&quot;Her name is Natsuki.&quot;

&quot;Of course, Natsuki. At any rate, I had planned to dissuade you from 
continuing to pursue a relationship with her by cutting off contact 
between the two of you and by showing you my displeasure with the 
situation. Obviously you have no intention of ending things with 
Natsuki, and you&#39;ve gone to great lengths to show me this. I am not so 
foolish as to lose my daughter over such a disagreement, and I am 
willing to make a compromise with you.&quot;

&quot;What do you propose?&quot;

&quot;I will not interfere in your personal life anymore, and you may do 
whatever you please regarding your personal relationships. However, I 
ask in return that you refrain from doing anything that might bring 
negative public attention to Fujino Industries. I don&#39;t think that is 
too much to ask.&quot;

&quot;I will agree, as long as you give me your word that Natsuki is welcome 
at our home and that nothing even remotely like what happened yesterday 
with ever happen again.&quot;

&quot;I give you my word.&quot;

&quot;Thank you. I can&#39;t tell you how happy this makes me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad Shizuru. As your father, your happiness is of utmost 
importance to me.&quot;

&quot;Thank you father. I&#39;ll see you when you return from your business 
trip.&quot;

&quot;Alright, goodbye.&quot;

&quot;Goodbye.&quot;

With that, Shizuru shut her phone then turned to Natsuki, tears of 
relief already forming in her eyes. She allowed herself the comfort of 
Natsuki&#39;s embrace, gently crying into her neck as the dark-haired girl 
held her tightly.

&quot;Well, I guess we don&#39;t have to stay in this hotel room anymore,&quot; said 
Natsuki. She then tentatively asked something she&#39;d been thinking about 
for some time. &quot;Do you, uh,&quot; she cleared her throat, &quot;do you think you 
might want to move in with me?&quot;

Shizuru pulled back and looked at Natsuki&#39;s face, and unreadable mix of 
emotions passing over her own before she flung herself back into her 
arms and began to sob.

&quot;But, I mean, you don&#39;t have to if you don&#39;t want to!&quot; Natsuki said, 
panicking. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to upset you or anything, it was just an idea 
I had, so...you don&#39;t have to cry.&quot;

&quot;Of course, of course I want to! I&#39;m just so happy that Natsuki would 
ask me to live with her.&quot;

Sheepishly, Natsuki rubbed the back of her head and said, &quot;Well, I know 
my place isn&#39;t that great compared to your parents&#39; house. I don&#39;t 
expect you to want to live there or anything...&quot;

&quot;I just said I wanted to! Silly Natsuki, your place is perfect. Besides, 
I wouldn&#39;t care if you lived in a run-down shack, as long as we could be 
together.&quot;

Natsuki smiled and gently wiped the tears from Shizuru&#39;s cheeks. &quot;I love 
you.&quot;

&quot;I love you too,&quot; said Shizuru, closing her eyes as they leaned together 
for a kiss.

&quot;Alright, now let&#39;s get our stuff go home,&quot; Natsuki said, squeezing 
Shizuru&#39;s hand warmly.

                         ***********************

*1 Month Later*

Natsuki, Mai, Mikoto, Chie, and Akane walked up the steps to her 
apartment. A big test was approaching, and today they&#39;d decided to all 
go to Natsuki&#39;s place to hold a study session. Natsuki&#39;s friends were 
intrigued at the prospect of finally getting to see the girl&#39;s home. 
Everyone knew she and Shizuru were living together now, and they were 
interested in seeing the interaction between the two of them.

&quot;Um, it might be a little messy, so don&#39;t be surprised,&quot; Natsuki said as 
she placed her key in the doorknob, unlocking it. Shit! I probably 
should have called Shizuru and let her know I was bringing friends over. 
She does occasionally like to jump me when I come home from school, I 
hope she wasn&#39;t planning to do anything today.

Mentally crossing her fingers, Natsuki hesitantly opened the front door.

&quot;Shizuruuuuu, I&#39;m home,&quot; she said loudly, &quot;I brought&#151;&quot;

Right at that moment, the girl in question slinked out of their bedroom, 
clad only in sexy black lingerie that left little to the imagination.

The girls behind Natsuki peeked around her and gasped at the sight in 
front of them. They watched with gaping mouths as a beet red Natsuki 
strode over to Shizuru and shielded her body from their shocked stares.

&quot;Uh, you guys take a seat in the l-living room, I&#39;ll b-be right back,&quot; 
Natsuki stuttered, obviously flustered and embarrassed.

The girls did as she said, looking at each other with highly amused 
faces. Natsuki, meanwhile, pulled Shizuru into their room and shut the 
door behind her. She looked up at Shizuru&#39;s face, hoping the other girl 
wouldn&#39;t be mad at her for showing up with her classmates unannounced. 
It was her fault, after all, for not calling and informing her. 
Amusement, clouded by uncertainty, graced the older girl&#39;s features.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;ve embarrassed you, Natsuki,&quot; she said softly.

&quot;No, no it&#39;s me who should be sorry! I should&#39;ve let you know I was 
bringing people over,&quot; Natsuki quickly responded.

&quot;I felt like surprising you today, I hope you aren&#39;t upset with me.&quot;

&quot;Of course not.&quot;

&quot;I just won&#39;t do it again in the future,&quot; Shizuru said with a solemn 
face, though inside she was brimming with delight over teasing her 
dark-haired companion.

&quot;No!&quot; Natsuki nearly yelled, then said in a quieter voice, &quot;I mean, no, 
please don&#39;t stop doing it.&quot;

Shizuru then let a smile grace her lips. &quot;I loved how protective my 
Natsuki was out there, trying to keep her friends from seeing me.&quot;

Natsuki looked up at her with possessiveness in her eyes, her cheeks 
still blazing, &quot;I want to be the only one who can see you like this.&quot;

&quot;Well you are, silly girl.&quot; Shizuru&#39;s eyes darkened suddenly, and 
beckoning seductively to Natsuki she asked, &quot;Don&#39;t you want to have a 
little fun before you go out there and study?&quot;

Natsuki could only nod, entranced, as she was irresistibly drawn to her 
scantily clad lover. Knowing her friends were just outside in the living 
room made her unbearably hot, and she felt her control snap at the first 
touch of her hand on Shizuru&#39;s naked skin. Unable to stop herself, she 
pushed Shizuru up against the nearest wall and crushed her mouth against 
hers. The brunette&#39;s eyes widened in surprise at her girlfriend&#39;s 
aggressiveness, but soon closed in pleasure as she moaned into the kiss.

Natsuki felt like she was on fire. Shizuru&#39;s skin seemed to burn her 
fingertips as she ran her hands all over her body. One hand unhooked the 
black bra and tore it from Shizuru&#39;s body, before pushing up one of her 
breasts to her eager mouth. The other hand moved down to the lacy black 
panties, sliding down to feel the wetness between Shizuru&#39;s legs. 
Pushing them aside, she deftly slipped two fingers into her slick heat 
and began thrusting them in and out.

Covering Shizuru&#39;s mouth with her own, Natsuki muffled the girl&#39;s moans 
and whimpers as she drove her over the edge with her hand. Shizuru&#39;s 
shaky knees couldn&#39;t support her trembling body, and she began to slide 
down the wall. Grabbing her quickly, Natsuki held the taller girl up as 
she slumped against her body. She laid her down on the bed and gave her 
a quick kiss. &quot;Come out and join us once you&#39;ve recovered,&quot; she said, 
then ran her eyes over Shizuru&#39;s body before adding, &quot;and gotten 
dressed.&quot;

Shizuru could only nod her head weakly before closing her eyes and 
savoring the aftermath of her orgasm. Natsuki went to the bathroom and 
cleaned up, then made her way to the living room to face the group of 
girls. They had already gotten out their books and had begun studying, 
but all of their heads jerked up as Natsuki entered the room.

&quot;Ah ha ha ha, so, what are we going to study first?&quot; Natsuki asked 
nervously, hoping no one would question what she had been doing for the 
past five minutes.

&quot;We&#39;re going over history right now,&quot; said Chie, looking at Natsuki 
expectantly.

Natsuki sat down and got out her history notebook, fully aware that 
everyone&#39;s eyes were still on her. She lifted her head and looked around 
at everyone.

&quot;Uh, Shizuru will be out in a little while. She&#39;s, um, feeling 
pretty...tired right now.&quot;

&quot;Uh huh, I&#39;m sure she is, &quot;said Mai, a hint of amusement in her voice.

Natsuki&#39;s face turned red once more that afternoon. &quot;Yeah, so,&quot; she 
said, clearing her throat, &quot;why don&#39;t we go over the Meiji Resoration in 
1868?&quot;

&quot;Yes, that&#39;s a good idea; I think the teacher mentioned it would be on 
the test,&quot; Akane said quickly.

They then began their studying, Natsuki unable to concentrate as her 
thoughts continually drifted to her infinitely sexy girlfriend resting 
in the next room.

It was a while later when Shizuru finally emerged from the bedroom. 
Natsuki was facing away from her, so she didn&#39;t see her immediately. She 
groaned inwardly, however, when she saw the wide-eyed expressions on the 
other girls&#39; faces as they looked down the hallway. Turning her head 
around, she saw what was eliciting this reaction. Foregoing the lingerie 
this time, Shizuru was dressed in a short, silky, kimono-style bath 
robe, which revealed an indecent amount of cleavage.

Natsuki could only look at Shizuru&#39;s grinning face as she sputtered out 
for the umpteenth time, &quot;Sh-Shizuru!&quot;

&quot;Ara? I thought Natsuki-chan told me to come out when I got dressed?&quot;

Natsuki turned to her shocked friends and forced a smile, saying, 
&quot;Sorry, excuse me for a second.&quot; She then got up and dragged Shizuru 
back into the bedroom, making sure she got properly dressed before 
coming back out to the living room. Luckily, the rest of the afternoon 
passed without incident. Shizuru made them snacks and brought them 
drinks, making everyone smile at her cheerful demeanor. When the 
studying was finally finished, the girls packed up their books and made 
their way to the front door.

&quot;Thanks for coming over, I&#39;ll see you guys at school tomorrow,&quot; said 
Natsuki.

&quot;See you!&quot; said Akane.

&quot;Bye!&quot; said Mikoto.

&quot;Later!&quot; said Chie.

&quot;Oh yeah, Natsuki,&quot; said Mai, and everyone stopped to listen. &quot;We should 
definitely study at your apartment more often, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever 
had such a revealing study session before.&quot;

All of the girls laughed at this, and Natsuki&#39;s fiery blush only fueled 
their mirth. Her lips began to twitch and she was soon laughing along 
with them. They then bid each other farewell and Natsuki went back 
inside.

Shizuru was sitting on the couch waiting for her and barely had time to 
react as Natsuki dashed at her. She darted down the hall, the 
raven-haired girl chasing in hot pursuit. Running into the bedroom she 
launched herself onto the bed with a shriek as Natsuki, right on her 
heels, jumped on top of her. Natsuki trapped her arms, then began 
tickling her sides until she was begging for mercy, which was finally 
granted. The sunlight was streaming low through the blinds as the two 
looked at each other with playful smiles. The air changed, however, as 
Shizuru&#39;s eyes flicked down from Natsuki&#39;s eyes to her lips, and her 
pink tongue peeked out to moisten her own. They kissed passionately, 
reveling in their love for one another and in the happiness that their 
long and arduous journey to be together was complete.
