<h1>What Dreams May Come (part 2 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leebot.html">Leebot</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/whatdreams-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><p>Prelude to a Dream<hr><i>Ara, Natsuki. I’ve decided that since a lot of my thoughts might be 
a bit much for you, I would write all of those down in a letter. If I’m ever blessed enough 
to have you love me as I love you, then I’ll be able to give you this and see that adorable 
blush on your face which should have formed right as you read the word 
“adorable.”</i></p><p><i>And right about now, you should be feeling me catch you with a 
surprise hug. And now, I’ll place my lips gently at the bottom of your neck, right inside 
the collarbone, and give you a sweet, sweet kiss. I’ll slowly move up, kissing my way along 
your neck as you lose yourself to pleasure, until… well, somehow I doubt you’re reading this 
anymore. By the time you get back to reading you’ll already know exactly what I’m planning 
to do to you.</i></p><p><i>Ah, it’s nice to dream about us like that. It’s just too bad I’m 
limited to my dreams. I’m not complaining though. I have all I really need just being with 
you, as long as I can occasionally let some of my true feelings through in a way to make you 
blush. Don’t complain, I know you appreciate it, and I know you’ll never admit 
it.</i></p><p><i>But I should really get on with things. I’ve gotten this far in the letter, 
and I haven’t even told you when I’m writing it! Today’s my graduation day, as a matter of 
fact. I know it should be very exciting for me, but I can’t help thinking of what this 
means. After this, I’m going on to Fuuka University, and Natsuki will still be in Fuuka 
Gakuen. I won’t be able to see you in school every day until you graduate too. That’s really 
what got me thinking of you, and I decided to start on this letter then.</i></p><p><i>Right 
now, I should probably go out and track you down to satisfy my Natsuki addiction. But before 
then, there’s one more thing I’d like to get written down. Back on the last day of the 
Carnival, you really saved me, and I can never thank you enough. I know if I told this to 
you, you’d probably just tell me that you did it because I saved you, both after your mother 
died and earlier during the Carnival. But your actions were different, Natsuki. I saved you 
out of a selfish love; I only wanted you for myself. You saved me out of a much purer love; 
you did it just for me. Because of this, I made a vow on that day. I would put all of my 
interests second to yours when it came to our relationship. I would be whatever you needed 
from me, whether a friend, a very special friend, or a lover. So far you’ve seemed to want 
me as a special friend, and I’m delighted to fulfill that role for you.</i></p><p><i>Well, 
I’m off to find you now. I don’t have too much time before I’ll have to get to the 
graduation ceremony, so I’ll likely have to compress all the usual stages of our encounters 
down to a few minutes. Hmm, I wonder how long it will take me to get you to blush? I’ll set 
my watch to time it and let you know in my next entry.</i></p><p><i>Much 
love,</i></p><p><i>Shizuru</i></p><hr><i>Ara-ra, where could you be, Natsuki? I had to go to 
my graduation without my Natsuki fix; I’ll have to make you blush twice to make up for 
this.</i></p><p>Shizuru let out a sigh, having exhausted her final option for running into 
Natsuki: the Student Council meeting room. In the past, she could always count on Natsuki 
ending up here, having borrowed Shizuru’s computer for research. But now that the First 
District had disbanded, Natsuki no longer had any need to use the computer. There was still 
a chance she’d come here just to meet Shizuru, but that didn’t seem to be the case 
either.</p><p>While Shizuru may have been out of places she could look to find Natsuki on 
her own, she was far from out of resources. She might be leaving the school soon, but until 
then, she still had a legion of fangirls who would be more than willing to do whatever she 
might ask of them. Surely at least one of them would have seen Natsuki, and even if not, it 
would be no problem getting them to scour the campus for her.</p><p>Although they’d surely 
do it for her, Shizuru knew that a lot of them would probably resent it. Many of them felt 
jealous of Natsuki for her special place in Shizuru’s heart, and helping the two meet up 
wouldn’t help the situation. It wouldn’t be right for the last thing she asked of them to be 
something they’d regret.</p><p>There had to be some way, though. Shizuru accessed the 
devious side of her mind, and it didn’t take long at all for it to come up with a solution. 
It was simple, really. All she had to do was tell her fangirls that she wanted to see 
Natsuki because she was angry with her and they had some things to “settle.” They’d be sure 
to jump on the task with glee. A smirk developed on Shizuru’s face as she imagined them 
delivering a hogtied Natsuki to her. That would do quite well to make up for her not being 
around before the ceremony. Maybe she could even have some more fun with Natsuki in that 
state and let her build up some credit for future indiscretions.</p><p>Set with a plan, 
Shizuru put back on her mask of grace and left the meeting room. As she closed the door 
behind her, she paused in front of it as she scanned the hallway for a member of her fanclub 
she could enlist to help. She didn’t catch sight of any of them in her first pass, but as 
she turned back she caught sight of a figure who hadn’t been there before rapidly turning 
around to walk away from her.</p><p>It didn’t take Shizuru long to identify her. Even if 
Shizuru hadn’t seen her in every Student Council meeting for the last two years, Kikukawa 
Yukino’s untamable mass of short brown hair was a dead giveaway. 
“Kikukawa-san?”</p><p>Yukino visibly flinched at Shizuru’s voice. Shizuru’s heart sank into 
dread as she remembered what she’d done to Yukino during the Carnival. Yukino had every 
right to be uncomfortable around her. Shizuru decided that this might be a time when being a 
little bit more open with her feelings would be best, so she let her mask drop a little to 
let her regret show through on her face. The last thing Yukino needed to see was an 
emotionless face from Shizuru; it would just remind of her of how Shizuru was during the 
Carnival.</p><p>Yukino took a few moments, but she did eventually steel herself and turn to 
face Shizuru. “Forgive me, Kaichou-san, that was rude of me.”</p><p>“It’s alright, I 
understand.” Shizuru felt an impulse to reach out and rest her hand on Yukino’s shoulder, 
but she held back. She wasn’t the one who should be trying to comfort her; it was more 
likely to just make her even more uncomfortable.</p><p>The two girls stood there in an 
uncomfortable silence for a few long moments, until Shizuru thought of something she could 
say to break it. “Actually, I just graduated, so I’m no longer the Kaichou. You’re the one 
who should be addressed as ‘Kaichou-san’ now.”</p><p>“Yeah… I guess,” Yukino said. The 
subject change seemed to do nothing to put her at ease, as she kept her eyes firmly rooted 
to the floor.</p><p>Shizuru sighed. This wasn’t working; they couldn’t just ignore the 
issues between them. “Kikukawa-san, I’m sorry, but I’m a bit busy looking for Natsuki now. 
Can we talk later, though?”</p><p>Yukino seemed to weigh her options for a moment. Shizuru 
knew that Yukino probably wouldn’t be enthused to talk to her again, but Yukino eventually 
nodded. “Alright,” she said, mustering the courage to look up at Shizuru.</p><p>“Thank you, 
Kikukawa-san. I’ll phone you later.” Shizuru gave Yukino a small smile and walked around 
her. She’d lost all enthusiasm to see Natsuki hogtied before her, but she did still want to 
see her friend.</p><p>“Kai- er, Fujino-san!” Shizuru paused in her step and turned back to 
face Yukino. “I… um, I ran into Natsuki not long ago. She was looking for Sakomizu-sensei, 
but I don’t know where he might be.”</p><p>Shizuru’s smile widened slightly. Maybe things 
wouldn’t be so hard with Yukino, after all. “Thank you, Kaichou-san.” A slight blush formed 
on Yukino’s cheeks upon hearing the former Kaichou address her by this title, and she nodded 
quickly and turned away.</p><p><i>Yukino’s rather cute herself when she blushes, but she 
doesn’t compare to Natsuki. Let’s see, I already checked at Sakomizu’s garden, but maybe 
Natsuki got there after I checked.</i><hr>“…tra classes, you’ll have to repeat your freshman 
year onward,” Sakomizu was saying as Shizuru got in range to hear him.</p><p><i>I warned 
you, Natsuki. Even so, there is </i>no way<i> I am going to wait an extra year for you to 
get to university. I’d rather repeat a grade myself. But before we get to that, you’re 
reaction should be quite a treat.</i></p><p>Shizuru approached silently, not wanting to 
interrupt and ruin the moment. She watched in amusement as a flustered Natsuki tried to find 
a way out. “Well, but you see… Something like that… you can do something about it, 
right?”</p><p><i>Oh, this is priceless. Alright, Natsuki, this makes up for missing me this 
morning.</i></p><p>“Nothing can be done!” Sakomizu said with an evil glint in his eyes. He 
seemed to be enjoying this as much as Shizuru. “I don’t think it’s time for you to be going 
on a jolly journey.”</p><p>“J-just a minute!”</p><p>Natsuki was so adorable in her 
frustration that Shizuru couldn’t resist a second more. Shizuru stepped out and put on her 
classic smile. “Why? Repeating isn’t bad.”</p><p>“Shizuru…” Natsuki turned around slowly, 
her teeth gritted and a slight blush already present on her face. She looked quite like she 
wanted to bolt and hide under a rock, but knew that it would only bring her more 
embarrassment from Shizuru when she was found.</p><p>“Maybe I shouldn’t graduate then?” 
Shizuru was thankful at this moment that she still had her diploma with her, so she could 
make a big show of discarding it. The show apparently succeeded, as Natsuki was too 
embarrassed to do anything but let out a whimper, her face still frozen in a fearful grin. 
“Ara, Natsuki, if you keep your face like that, it just might get stuck.”</p><p>This broke 
Natsuki out of that expression, and she followed it up by giving Shizuru her usual evil 
glare. Of course, although the glare would do wonders against the average person, Shizuru 
had long since developed an immunity to it. “I don’t think it’s that easy to undo a 
graduation,” Natsuki said.</p><p>“Oh?” Shizuru feigned consideration of this for a moment 
and then said, “Well, then I guess you’re just going to have to take extra classes over the 
summer.”</p><p>Natsuki sighed in resignation. “Fine, fine.” She reverted to her glare. “But 
I’m going to make you tutor me through every one of them!”</p><p>“Oh, so Natsuki wants me to 
be her teacher? This could be fun.” Shizuru picked up her diploma and looked at it as if it 
were a clipboard. “Oh my, it says here that Natsuki has been a very naughty girl in skipping 
classes. We’ll have to find a suitable punishment for you.” Now Shizuru took her turn at 
giving Natsuki her best evil glare, though this one held a fair bit more mischievousness 
than Natsuki’s. It was also a lot more effective.</p><p>“Shizuru!” Natsuki turned around 
quickly, apparently remembering about Sakomizu. Fortunately for her pride, he’d left to tend 
to another part of his garden when Shizuru had come. “Maybe I can get Mai to help me,” she 
mumbled.</p><p>Shizuru put on her best feigned hurt expression. “Does Natsuki not want to me 
to help her out?”</p><p>Natsuki faltered for a moment. She definitely didn’t like seeing 
even feigned pain on Shizuru’s face, but she apparently decided to continue fighting this 
battle – or, as Shizuru saw it, digging her grave even deeper. “Natsuki doesn’t want to be 
subject to your punishment! I know what goes on in that dirty mind of yours, Fujino 
Shizuru.”</p><p>Shizuru mentally sighed. <i>I guess I really can’t exact that form of 
“punishment” on her now that she knows about my feelings. And I so wanted to see Natsuki in 
a cute French maid’s outfit…</i> <i>Alright, I’ll let you win this battle, Natsuki, but I 
won’t be this merciful forever.</i> “Well, if you’re going to have Mai tutor you, then I 
think you’d want to get on her good side,” Shizuru said.</p><p>Natsuki looked at her in 
stunned silence. It wasn’t often that Shizuru would let her win one of their 
battles.</p><p>Shizuru ignored Natsuki’s incredulous gaze and continued, “I believe most of 
the girls were going to let Mai decide what we’d all do to celebrate the end of the school 
year, and I don’t think it would be a good idea for Natsuki not to come.”</p><p>“I was going 
to come!” Natsuki protested.</p><p>“Was Natsuki that enthusiastic about singing Karaoke? I 
hear you put on quite the show last time; I’m just sad I had to miss it.”</p><p>The color 
drained from Natsuki’s face. “K-karaoke?”</p><p>“What else do you think Mai would want to 
do? Now come on, let’s go. You wouldn’t want to be late, would you?” Not waiting for a 
response, Shizuru turned and started off. <i>Okay, Natsuki, I think we’re even for this 
morning now. But I hope you don’t think I’m going to help you get out of singing 
karaoke.</i></p><p>“Shizuru.”</p><p>Shizuru turned around to see that Natsuki hadn’t moved 
from her spot. “Yes, Natsuki?”</p><p>Natsuki idly played with her hair as she took a moment 
to calm her nerves. “Tonight, Shizuru… can we talk? There’s… something I need to… talk to 
you about.”</p><p>Shizuru briefly considered teasing the girl about her nerves, but decided 
that Natsuki had probably had enough for the day. Besides, something told her this wasn’t a 
good time to be teasing. She widened her smile a little bit and said, “Of course, Natsuki. 
I’m always free to talk to you.”</p><p>Natsuki relaxed a little, though she was apparently 
still a bit nervous as she hadn’t stopped twirling her hair about her finger. “Thank you, 
Shizuru,” she said. Shizuru suspected she was being thanked more for not teasing her than 
agreeing to talk, but she decided not to say anything.</p><hr>“I hope you enjoyed yourself 
tonight, Shizuru,” Natsuki said. “Because I am <i>never</i> singing karaoke 
again.”</p><p>“Ara, but Natsuki looked so cute up there!” Shizuru said. <i>I can’t believe 
they actually had a French maid outfit for her! What did I ever do to deserve 
this?</i></p><p>Natsuki’s face flushed, or at least so Shizuru assumed. All she could see at 
the moment was the back of Natsuki’s neck, but it was sufficiently red. “And do you have any 
plans of letting go of me and getting off the bike? We’ve been in front of your house for 
five minutes now.”</p><p>“No,” Shizuru said. “Natsuki is just too huggable. It’s your own 
fault, really.”</p><p>“Well I’m getting off now, and you’ll need to let go if you don’t want 
to have an intimate encounter with the pavement.”</p><p>“Meanie.” Shizuru reluctantly slid 
her arms from around Natsuki, being sure to apply slight pressure with her fingers as they 
traced Natsuki’s belly and sides. A grin crossed her face as she saw Natsuki shiver at her 
touch. Shizuru then jumped off the bike; she figured she might as well go first as she’d 
have to unlock the door for Natsuki.</p><p>“So do you own this house?” Natsuki asked as she 
got off the bike and put her helmet away.</p><p>“My parents bought it for me a few years 
ago,” Shizuru explained as she unlocked the door. “They said I should have some place in 
Fuuka to stay if I needed a break from campus. I never felt the need to come out here until 
now, but it’ll make a good place to stay until I move into the university dorms.”</p><p>As 
they walked inside, Natsuki looked around and commented, “It doesn’t look very dirty. Are 
you sure you haven’t been here in years?”</p><p>“I think I’d remember,” Shizuru said. “But I 
hired a maid to come in and clean it a few days ago. I’m sorry I can’t offer you anything to 
eat or drink, though. I still need to go out and get groceries. I hope you’ll forgive me for 
being a poor hostess this one night.”</p><p>“It’s alright, Shizuru, I won’t be too long,” 
Natsuki said. Shizuru thought she was starting to get a bit nervous again and wondered what 
could be on her mind. “Is there some place we can sit down?”</p><p>“I think the living room 
is just around here… ah yes, here we go,” Shizuru said as she led Natsuki. She took a seat 
in a chair which was significantly more expensive than it was comfortable and asked, “So 
what did Natsuki want to talk about?”</p><p>Natsuki sat down on a loveseat across the room 
from Shizuru and took a couple slow breaths before she said, “Do you remember what I said to 
you during the Carnival?”</p><p>Shizuru smiled. “I remember Natsuki said many sweet things 
to me.”</p><p>Natsuki dropped her gaze as a light blush formed on her cheeks. “Yes, well… 
It’s just that, one of the things I said, I meant it at the time, but now I’m not so 
sure…”</p><p>Shizuru’s smile disappeared as her heart sank. <i>She doesn’t love me? No… with 
Duran’s size, she’d have to. Is she not happy about how I feel about her? I’m sorry, 
Natsuki. I don’t know if I could stop loving you even if you needed me 
too.</i></p><p>Natsuki’s eyes widened in surprise, and Shizuru mused that it was no use 
trying to hide her pain from her friend. “No, no Shizuru, it’s not like that!”</p><p>Shizuru 
let out a breath that she didn’t realize she’d been holding. “Don’t play with my emotions 
like that, Natsuki.” <i>After all of Natsuki’s nervousness, I’m the one whose making a fool 
of herself. Good job, Shizuru.</i></p><p>“Sorry,” Natsuki said. “But, the thing I’m not sure 
about was… and please remember it’s just that I’m not sure, but it was when I said that…” 
Natsuki trailed off into mumbles at the end of her sentence, turning her face away from 
Shizuru.</p><p>“What was that, Natsuki?”</p><p>“I don’t know how I feel, okay!” Natsuki 
practically shouted at Shizuru, still refusing to look at her. Shizuru sat in stunned 
silence, half surprised at Natsuki’s outburst and half trying not to let her hopes get out 
of control. “I told you back then that I couldn’t love you in the same way, but I…” Shizuru 
thought she heard Natsuki choke back a sob. “I need some time.”</p><p>Shizuru felt like her 
heart was being torn apart. Part of it wanted to be ecstatic that she actually had a chance 
with Natsuki, while another part of it wanted to fall into depression for seeing Natsuki in 
such a fragile state. Eventually, her mind intervene and decided that worrying about Natsuki 
had to take priority. She moved over to Natsuki and wrapped her in a hug, trying to make it 
as chaste as possible. “Natsuki can have all the time she needs to decide,” she 
said.</p><p>“Thank you, Shizuru,” Natsuki said after a few minutes. She raised her right 
hand up to grip Shizuru’s, silently signaling that it was alright to let go now. Shizuru sat 
back, not bothering to move back to her former seat. She suppressed the urge to lightly 
stroke Natsuki’s back; now definitely wasn’t the time.</p><p>They sat there in silence for a 
few minutes. In it, Shizuru tried to puzzle out what was making this so hard for Natsuki. It 
wasn’t as if she was saying anything bad, or even embarrassing. Did she just not like being 
unsure? Was it sharing her feelings that she didn’t like? Natsuki might have presented a 
rougher exterior, but Shizuru knew that she held her heart in even closer check than Shizuru 
did. She probably just didn’t like appearing vulnerable.</p><p>“Just… one more thing, 
Shizuru,” Natsuki eventually said. She was still facing away from Shizuru. Shizuru suspected 
that Natsuki might have been crying, and didn’t want to reveal it to her.</p><p>“Anything, 
Natsuki.”</p><p>“I need some space,” Natsuki said. “I just can’t think straight when I’m 
around you… and for this, I need to be as clear as possible.”</p><p>“Alright, Natsuki. 
Whatever you need,” Shizuru said with reluctance. <i>I promised you anything. But you have 
no idea what you’re doing to me, Natsuki, to give me this hope and then say you need time 
away from me. The hope should get me through it, at least.</i></p><p>As Shizuru felt a tear 
cross her cheek, she was suddenly glad that Natsuki still had her back to her. As Shizuru 
thought about the prospect of spending time away from Natsuki, she decided that there was 
something she had to do first. “Forgive me, Natsuki,” she whispered. She leaned forward 
slowly, making sure Natsuki had plenty of time to pull away if she wanted to, though she 
probably didn’t realize what Shizuru was planning.</p><p>She rested her chin on Natsuki’s 
shoulder, and slowly bent her head around to plant a soft kiss on Natsuki’s cheek. Her heart 
fluttered when she realized that Natsuki had let her go through with it without trying to 
move away at all and had only reacted with a slight blush rising to her cheek. As she pulled 
back, Shizuru licked her lips and found a slight salty taste. Natsuki had indeed by 
crying.</p><p>Natsuki didn’t appear to be in the mood for leaving at the moment, so Shizuru 
offered, “I have a spare futon if you’d like to stay for the night.”</p><p>Natsuki shook her 
head. “Thanks, but I should go now.” She wiped her face with her sleeve before she got up 
and turned to face Shizuru. “I’ll talk to you later, okay?”</p><p>Shizuru gave Natsuki one 
of the special smiles she saved just for her. “Okay. Don’t keep me waiting too long, 
though.” Natsuki gave a slight nod at this and turned to go, not so much agreeing as simply 
acknowledging that she knew Shizuru would be waiting for her.</p><p><i>Please make the right 
decision, Natsuki.</i></p>
