Shizuru idly flipped through one of her business textbooks as she sat on 
a couch in a foreign home, going over the material that she would be 
tested on for an exam. Aya sat on opposite her, for now preferring the 
floor and the easy access to the table there. The brunette pre-med major 
was going over her own coursework, the two having teamed up to study 
that afternoon. Shizuru wasn&#39;t paying much attention, in all honesty. 
Aya, every now and again, drifted her eyes up at the Kyoto woman, mildly 
worried.

It had happened again. They had originally agreed to meet in downtown 
Kyoto to help each other go over the chapter reviews of their respective 
books while having tea at a place Shizuru was familiar with. Not half 
way through their session, Shizuru noticed eyes on her. She didn&#39;t 
recognize the face, but the look was pure malice. It was not a longing 
stare from an admirer or even a mildly irritated gaze that may have 
resulted from the two girls talking loudly. It was pure and 
unadulterated hate. It didn&#39;t take Shizuru long to leave.

She had offered a simple, &quot;Ah, it&#39;s more difficult to review these 
things in public than I thought. Why don&#39;t we go to your apartment?&quot;

Aya had given her a mildly surprised look before relenting. Her 
apartment was in Kyoto itself &#150; close and convenient. Shizuru was 
looking around for one there as well, before the next semester began. 
Every time she went into public, she became paranoid that that would 
happen. It was not as rare as she would have hoped. Her breathing 
slightly increased in speed as stress set in. That man had been older 
and far more bitter than the child who had spotted her in Fuuka. He was 
going to alert the authorities.

&quot;Shizuru?&quot; Aya asked, leaning in with that same look of concern she&#39;d 
been trying to hide since they returned to her place.

&quot;Yes?&quot; She pretended to be absorbed in her rather boring studies.

Aya set her book down on the table and stared directly at the other 
woman. &quot;Is everything all right? You had an awfully sudden change in 
mood.&quot;

Shizuru looked up at her for the first time in a while and offered her a 
gentle smile, very glad that Aya did not know her well enough to see 
through her mask and her closely guarded emotions. &quot;Yes, I&#39;m perfectly 
fine. Just a bit stressed from the pressure of final exams. That&#39;s all.&quot;

Aya rose an eyebrow up, and a smirk formed on her face. She spoke in 
kyoto-ben, just like Shizuru. &quot;Well, you clearly aren&#39;t concentrating on 
your book. Are we going to have to find some way to release all that 
tension of yours so that you can get to work? This scholastic 
delinquency isn&#39;t going to earn you a suitable grade.&quot;

Shizuru chuckled dryly. She&#39;d been quite skittish whenever they were 
being intimate thanks to Natsuki&#39;s interruption the first time they&#39;d 
tried anything. Every time they started while they were at Shizuru&#39;s, 
she was afraid the Kuga zombie would stumble through the door hissing in 
protest (&#39;Rah, get off of her, you slut, or you will please die 
horribly!&#39;). &quot;No, I think I can manage without the aid. That would just 
take an hour away from studying, if you were to do it somewhat 
properly.&quot;

&quot;You break my heart so,&quot; Aya replied, and though she didn&#39;t show a 
frown, it did not please Shizuru. Perhaps she would do just that. She 
worried too much, perhaps. The relationship was still far too young for 
her to even be concerned about such emotions. She was good company 
either way.

Shizuru&#39;s cellphone began to ring, and she fumbled through her purse to 
claim it. When she had, she recognized Tanya&#39;s name on the display and 
pressed the proper button to receive the call. &quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Can you be in Kyoto by tonight?&quot; Tanya asked without so much as a 
greeting. Shizuru&#39;s breath caught at the seriousness of that tone. The 
police? No, not so soon. That could not be it.

&quot;I&#39;m already in town. What&#39;s the matter?&quot; Shizuru replied, and Aya 
looked up with confusion and worry, not particularly pleased with 
Shizuru&#39;s tone with how things had been going so far.

&quot;The deadlock is over. Your father&#39;s will is finally being divided up 
now that all the Fujinos have given up with all their lawyer battles. I 
need you to sit in on the meetings soon. Stay at my place for the night 
and we&#39;ll head in tomorrow morning. Your exam isn&#39;t until Monday, 
right?&quot;

Shizuru stared blankly ahead, her reply almost automatic, too shocked by 
the news to give it much thought. &quot;Yes, that&#39;s right. I can stay at your 
house tonight, then.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re entitled to a great deal of money, you know,&quot; Tanya pointed out. 
&quot;More than most of his relatives. You&#39;re going to have a war with Kaori 
and her siblings, though. Be prepared for more of the same bullshit you 
had when you were little. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;And if I do not want it?&quot;

Tanya was quiet on the other end of the line, not expecting such a 
statement. Shizuru thought it was too much of a hassle, then? &quot;There 
isn&#39;t enough money to pay for a second year of the university for you. 
I&#39;d rather you not be placed into endless debt from student loans. It&#39;s 
worth fighting for. You can lock everything else away in an account and 
leave it to rot for all I care, but your education comes first and this 
is free funding.&quot;

Shizuru sighed. &quot;Very well, then. I&#39;ll head over now, then. See you in a 
few minutes.&quot;

She and Tanya exchanged good-byes and hung up, leaving Shizuru in the 
presence of a very intrigued Aya, who had been gazing at her for the 
duration of the phone call. Shizuru began to pile her books back into 
her bag, clearing her side of the table off. &quot;What was that about?&quot;

&quot;That was my aunt. I have minor family thing to go to,&quot; Shizuru began to 
explain, standing up. &quot;Thank you for letting me come over to study. I&#39;ll 
see you soon.&quot;

&quot;Ah, well, all right. Take care, Shizuru,&quot; Aya said as she stood up to 
properly bid the other woman farewell. She moved forward and the pair 
went through the obligatory kiss goodbye. Shizuru withdrew after just a 
moment, giving the other woman a parting and warm smile before she 
stepped out the door and headed down to her car.

The relatives had finally given up with all the lawyer warring, had 
they? Her father had been one of the most prominent members of the 
Fujino family. Despite having written a will, everyone had wanted a 
larger piece of his fortune, and set to gain as much as possible by 
trying to proof their enemies were not worth of it all. Oh, the prospect 
of meeting them again just made her want to skip. She could do without 
her hundred million yen. But Tanya was right. Education came first.

Shizuru marched forward as if on a mission. Then again, that money could 
be equally spent on education and the one escape she could think of to 
prevent the law of man from catching up to her sins.

- - -

But you&#39;ve fantasized about making love to her even before the Carnival, 
haven&#39;t you?

Yes.

Then you want her. Even if you didn&#39;t ever want to admit it, and even if 
you never ever wanted anyone &#150; even yourself &#150; to find out the truth?

It wasn&#39;t like that. I can&#39;t control my dreams. I once had a dream I was 
a pretzel because I&#39;d encountered them that day. Am I a pretzel now? 
She&#39;s beautiful and I was around her all day. That&#39;s just how dreams 
work.

I said you &#39;fantasized about her,&#39; not &#39;dreamt about her.&#39; It&#39;s not a 
dream if you&#39;re awake when you&#39;re picturing it. Besides, what kind of 
logic is that? Just give up already. This is embarrassing. When did you 
start being such a pussy?

I&#39;m not interested in wom--

Yeah, you are. They aren&#39;t as stupid and they&#39;re hotter. You secretly 
think that everything about her body is perfect. I have access to these 
confidential files, remember? Stop being so stubborn. Maybe you&#39;re so 
twitchy because you just need to get laid. Have you ever thought of 
that? For that matter, can you imagine doing that with anyone other than 
Shizuru? There&#39;s always Takeda.

Or not. God, I never realized what a bitch I was.

Ta-da.

I don&#39;t want to deal with being a dyke. It&#39;s too hard.

Oh, please. Get over it. Since when did we care what anyone thought?

Screw you, I&#39;m going to go play Call of Duty. I don&#39;t want to talk about 
this anymore.

I&#39;ll be waiting here when you get back, love.

She&#39;d had the dialogue over and over again since their fight, and had 
never reached any kind of conclusion. She&#39;d pictured it before. So 
fucking what? It didn&#39;t mean anything. She was not a robot, but that 
didn&#39;t mean that she was going to go start dating women because of one 
tiny (but quite amazing none the less) fantasy she&#39;d had when she was in 
junior high. And then that one time in senior high, but that one was an 
accident.

Just buy some black eyeliner already. Your emo is giving me a goddamn 
headache. Either that or you can get off your ass and go get her before 
you lose her forever. You haven&#39;t even talked to her since then as it 
is.

...Shut up and keep your legs crossed, you.

The kiss did feel good, despite you standing there like a moron, didn&#39;t 
it?

When the rebellious voice had been unwillingly drafted into the British 
army, it grew silent, too occupied with avoiding German fire to do 
anything else. It always did the trick. Natsuki had won the Second World 
War about five times so far in the last month. The denial card still 
held the top position in her deck, and she was still more than willing 
to use it. The inner dialogue just repeated over and over since the 
argument. The same words, but unfortunately, the same action. Nothing.

- - -

&quot;As the Fujino family represents high Japanese culture in every aspect, 
I simply must protest this particular part of the will,&quot; Kaori began to 
speak, using that prim and proper kyoto-ben did not convey her true 
hatred. &quot;Now, my niece clearly deserves something, but to present so 
much to someone of mixed blood... it will set a negative precedence for 
future generations. Our goal is to keep our bloodline pure. This will 
encourage my nephews to marry westerners.&quot;

Shizuru held a hand over her mouth to silent her laughter. In all 
honesty, she&#39;d stopped listening to their ranting a while ago. Now the 
only thing she could stand to pay attention to was Tanya, who was so 
distraught and pissed off that her hand was balled into a tight fist and 
she was occasionally fidgeting in her seat. It wasn&#39;t supposed to be 
funny, but Shizuru could help but find such aggravation amusing. They 
were so opposite from each other sometimes.

&quot;She&#39;s his only heir. She gets the money,&quot; Tanya finally said.

Kaori looked at her for a moment before turning back to the single 
official presiding over the meeting between the Fujino kin. 
&quot;Furthermore, I feel that this woman is only pressuring the young girl 
to accept the inheritance purely so that she can have it for herself. As 
this woman has no blood relation to our family, I ask she be removed 
from the building.&quot;

&quot;Why, you little...&quot; Shizuru heard Tanya say just barely under her 
breath, using her willpower to prevent herself from doing anything rash.

&quot;Dragunova-sama represents Fujino Shin&#39;s in-laws. A few items have been 
left to them. She has every right to stay,&quot; the official stated. &quot;As for 
young mistress Shizuru, she is still entitled to what was left to her. 
Unless you can prove she is not a blood relation?&quot;

&quot;Her mother was rumored to run around,&quot; Kaori nearly hissed, trying one 
last desperate attempt to halt progress. Oh, that got Shizuru to pay 
attention. She had always heard Kaori call her mother a whore and a gold 
digger, and it was nothing further from the truth. Milena would never 
have put up with such shit for anything less than love.

&quot;If you would like to give me a paternity test, you are more than 
welcome to take a DNA sample,&quot; Shizuru stated calmly.

That seemed to shut Kaori up for now, knowing it was going to prove her 
argument wrong. &quot;She is young and reckless, then. She will waste such 
money if it is given to her on unnecessary wants that accompany youth.&quot;

&quot;It is her inheritance, ma&#39;am,&quot; the official said. &quot;It is hers to do 
with as she pleases. You and your siblings have each been entitled to 
eighty million yen. Shizuru-sama is, without any further debate, awarded 
the hundred and twenty million yen as issued by her father. Tanya is to 
return to Moscow with fifty million yen and Milena Dragunova&#39;s remaining 
possessions. With that, I would like to conclude this meeting.&quot;

Kaori seethed from where she stood while Tanya and Shizuru stood and 
made their way towards the door. Tanya leaned in toward her rival aunt 
and said, &quot;Thanks, Kaori. It&#39;s been great fun seeing you again.&quot;

&quot;Take your sister&#39;s spawn and get out of my sight. This is the closest 
either of you will ever get to my family ever again,&quot; Kaori, as head of 
the Fujino family, ordered.

&quot;Ara, goodbye, Auntie,&quot; Shizuru said. She leaned forward. &quot;May I have a 
kiss goodbye?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve heard that you kiss enough girls at it is, you disgusting little 
whore,&quot; Kaori hissed.

Shizuru bowed in false kindness, easing her way out the door and 
following Tanya to her car. &quot;Well, too bad, then. It was pleasure doing 
business with you. If you&#39;re ever strapped for cash, you&#39;ll know how to 
get in touch with me!&quot;

When both Tanya and her niece had returned to the vehicle parked 
outside, they fastened themselves in. Tanya started the sedan and 
reached for the radio, but paused. &quot;So, what do you intend to do with 
your money, then?&quot;

Shizuru shrugged. She had a slight plan. &quot;School, as you suggested. The 
remainder? I would like to buy property north of Kyoto for myself, if 
you think that can be arranged without too much hassle. I would prefer 
it done under a different name, however.&quot;

&quot;You running from the mafia, Shizuru?&quot; Tanya joked.

&quot;No. There are, never the less, people who would like to see me done 
away with. I would prefer to change my name and live in solitude. It can 
be arranged, can it not?&quot; The look she was getting said it all. 
Confusion, shock, and a message of &#39;what the fuck&#39; all in one glance. 
Tanya returned her hand to her leg, not going to turn on the radio with 
that kind of discussion.

&quot;What the hell happened to you if you have to change your damn name?&quot; 
Tanya questioned.

Shizuru stared her aunt directly in the face, her gaze never wavering, 
putting her faith in Tanya&#39;s love for her. &quot;I killed fifty-seven people 
in one night.&quot;

- - -

The usual crew was having dinner in Mai&#39;s dorm, as they sometimes did 
when they had a free night. Mikoto was gobbling down whatever it was 
that had been offered as an appetizer, not letting anyone else even see 
what it was. Natsuki tapped her chopsticks against the plate absently, 
listening to the others rant about nothing. She&#39;d been in a funk ever 
since the fight. That damn voice still wasn&#39;t shutting up. Maybe if she 
shoved the chopsticks in her ear and up towards her brain.

Yukino was late that evening, and Natsuki had assumed that it was due to 
her new duties as the kaichou. What was really keeping her, however, 
would be the start of the end of the lives they had lived so far. She 
entered the room holding her laptop, a grave and sullen expression on 
her mousy face. Haruka was behind her, showing up from law school to say 
hello to the group, with an equally pleased disposition.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter with you?&quot; Nao asked. &quot;Haruka get too rough and 
sprain something?&quot;

&quot;Watch your mouth, delinquent, or I&#39;ll punch you square in the jaw,&quot; 
Haruka countered, crossing her arms to display her authority. What an 
attitude that young punk had!

&quot;No, um, look, this is going to sound very strange, but stay with me,&quot; 
Yukino started. She sat down at the table and pulled up her laptop, a 
variety of windows open that all looked like code and processes or 
whatever the hell. Natsuki gave it a stray glance, but wasn&#39;t paying 
much attention yet. &quot;I&#39;ve been noticing some issues with my computer and 
I narrowed it down. Someone installed a program on here that&#39;s been 
monitoring my emails and clickstream. I have it quarantined and copied 
to a disc so I can analyze it further, but...&quot;

Mai gave her a wink. &quot;Yukino-san, you should know better than to go to 
questionable sites. That&#39;s what ends up happening.&quot;

The hacker shot her a glare. &quot;Give me a little credit, will you? I don&#39;t 
sit in front of the computer all day for nothing. This isn&#39;t your 
average spyware. This is a program made with special care and fairly 
complex coding. Midori emailed me from Iraq about a similar problem. I 
called the former kaichou earlier this evening, and she said she was 
having a similar issue. Have you all noticed anything odd on your 
computers?&quot;

Natsuki&#39;s eyes perked up a bit at the mention of Shizuru. &quot;No, I only 
use mine for gaming, really. Perhaps the occasional assignment if I 
can&#39;t use the lab at school.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll keep a lookout, I guess. Why, do you think it&#39;s something in the 
Fuuka network being spread around?&quot; Mai asked, still in the process of 
cooking a grand dinner for them all.

&quot;If kaichou and Midori have been subject to it, then it isn&#39;t an issue 
with just the network. Especially since it&#39;s just me that&#39;s got it so 
far within the Fuuka network,&quot; Yukino said, tapping once on her laptop. 
&quot;So far it&#39;s just us. Just the HiME.&quot;

That got Natsuki&#39;s attention, and she sat up, her inner misery 
temporarily moved aside to make way for tactical thinking and concern 
for Shizuru&#39;s well being. &quot;If it&#39;s just the HiME who are being targeted, 
and if it&#39;s monitoring us, then... Searrs?&quot;

&quot;But the crazy bitch took out First District,&quot; Nao said, earning a very 
heated look from an already testy Kuga.

&quot;First District, delinquent,&quot; Haruka said. &quot;As in there&#39;s more than one 
district. If they can mass the kind of army they did around Fuuka and 
have it not be a big deal, then they&#39;re obviously deep rooted somewhere. 
They probably have scores of guys left to harass the lot of us.&quot;

&quot;Rooms could be bugged,&quot; Natsuki interrupted, ushering in paranoia from 
just about everyone. Well, what? It was likely. No sense in letting them 
live a na&iuml;ve life if their well being was potentially on the line.

&quot;So, what do we do?&quot; Akane asked, already looking worried. She hadn&#39;t 
fared well in the Carnival, after all. She didn&#39;t know if she could do 
all that again any time soon.

There was silence for a moment, with everyone fixing their gazes on each 
other. Mai stopped cooking. Mikoto stopped shoveling food into her 
mouth. And, in the absence of any kind of plan, Natsuki spoke up. &quot;It&#39;s 
hard to track something you can&#39;t see. Keep a look out for any 
suspicious people or activity and report it to the group. We don&#39;t have 
Elements, so maybe get a weapon if you can afford one. Mace or something 
would work. Yukino, maybe you can find where the source of that program 
came from? The computer it was sent from, I mean?&quot;

&quot;I can try, but I wouldn&#39;t get my hopes up for anything,&quot; Yukino said.

&quot;Get a weapon? Are you mad?&quot; Yukariko said, looking almost appalled at 
Natsuki. She sat in a chair, her pregnant belly not making it easy to 
move around too much. Never the less, she waved an arm to accentuate her 
displeasure. &quot;You make it sound like we need to prepare for a war. I 
don&#39;t want to have a knife up my sleeve for the rest of my life.&quot;

Her hesitance would be her undoing, of course. Natsuki shrugged. &quot;If 
they&#39;re back to watching us, the choice isn&#39;t really ours to make, is 
it? I&#39;m going to go call some of my contacts and see if I can&#39;t dig up 
anything else. I&#39;ll talk to you all later.&quot;

She left them behind, heading out into the street, shivering in the cold 
while she dialed a number she had memorized. She wouldn&#39;t have risked 
putting it on her phone&#39;s memory. &quot;Hey. It&#39;s Kuga.&quot;

&quot;What do you want?&quot;

&quot;Searrs up to trouble again, is it?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t know anything this time. Sorry.&quot; He hung up without further word. 
It was not unexpected. He ran a high risk of being caught by those he 
worked for. So he&#39;d survived Shizuru&#39;s slaughter? How wonderful. But, 
still restless, she dialed another number, this one trapped in the 
phone&#39;s memory.

Shizuru...

&quot;Sakomizu, I need a gun.&quot;

- - -

Shizuru explained it all. The slaughter, the HiME, the Obsidian Lord... 
she told Tanya everything. It was for the intent purpose of receiving 
aid and letting her aunt know what she had in store for the future. 
Yukino&#39;s new warning had only served to further push her into seclusion. 
Tanya sat there with wide eyes, a hand over her mouth, as Shizuru 
detailed every event of the Carnival &#150; from her awakening, to Kiyohime, 
to she and Natsuki dying and resurrecting. If it didn&#39;t sound so off the 
wall, Tanya would have been convinced that Shizuru was making it up.

That week you didn&#39;t hear from anyone at Fuuka? Yes, that was because we 
were invaded by a secret army and held hostage for a while. That bridge 
wasn&#39;t wiped out by a random earthquake. A ten year old did it. That 
scar on the mountain? Giant dragon. Don&#39;t look at me like that, Tanya. 
You go ask Natsuki the same thing.

She felt very much like a superhero telling one of their closer friends 
or relative their secret. She supposed that&#39;s what it essentially was. 
Tanya didn&#39;t faint once. Shizuru was very proud. But there was still the 
matter of new business to attend to. With both Searrs and her victims 
sure to close in and hunt her down, Shizuru would be the first to fling 
herself into the wild, running like a hart through the woods. Her 
actions would begin the chase.

&quot;I want to buy property in the mountains north of Kyoto. A clear lot in 
the woods. I want to build a house there, separate from society. I no 
longer feel comfortable there, and it would put my life at risk,&quot; 
Shizuru explained. &quot;I want the records to list that it was purchased by 
someone other than me. A distant cousin, perhaps. Something that won&#39;t 
tip anyone off.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll... see if I can&#39;t get one of your second cousins on our side to 
agree. Someone with a different surname,&quot; Tanya stammered. All the 
Dragunovs were fanatically devoted to each other. It was the Cossack 
way. National boundaries didn&#39;t stop that. All that mattered was blood. 
Not quite like the mafia, but still its own separate identity.

Shizuru nodded, very glad she was calm and following along. &quot;I will 
change my name. The government will keep my old one on record if I go in 
an alter it. Fujino Shizuru needs to die.&quot;

At that, however, Tanya shook her head. &quot;This is like something out of a 
movie. Just how do you intend to do that? I swear to god if you hurt 
yourself...&quot;

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t jump to any conclusions,&quot; Shizuru said. She had been tossing 
ideas around all night. &quot;I&#39;ll go to a bar so that people will recognize 
me and can vouch for me being there. I&#39;ll get tanked. I&#39;ll get back in 
my car. I will then drive down the street &#150; I can manage it &#150; and meet 
you or someone else, who will dump said car into a river or the sea. A 
car accident.&quot;

Let&#39;s just traumatize Natsuki with a car wreck again, shall we? She 
hated the vehicles enough as it was. Shizuru would have to take care to 
inform the biker about this little plan. Perhaps just after it happened, 
so that she could not protest. Natsuki. Her HiME urge to protect was 
kicking in. Natsuki was no doubt going to be hunted down by Searrs as 
well. She would have to think up something for that too.

Tanya put her head in her hands, sighing. &quot;God, this is too much.&quot;

&quot;I know. I&#39;m sorry. I don&#39;t want to burden anyone with these troubles, 
but I don&#39;t have the connections yet to do this all on my own. You are 
one of the only people I trust,&quot; Shizuru said. Her businesslike 
composure began to crack a bit as she started down that line. &quot;I know it 
will be hard to look at me the same again after what I&#39;ve told you, Aunt 
Tanya. I still don&#39;t know what happened during that time, but I... it 
was not really me who did such things. Please just don&#39;t look at me like 
I&#39;m a monster. I didn&#39;t mean to do it, I just...&quot;

She found herself trapped in a hug. Despite Tanya not knowing just 
how... clouded and lost she had felt during the Carnival, or any of the 
more technical HiME details, she was there. &quot;I know. I love you, 
Shizuru. We&#39;ll get you somewhere safe.&quot;

It was a true testament of devotion to defend those you loved without 
question. Tanya smiled at her, hoping to reassure her. Within a month, a 
lot had been selected, and a traditional Japanese home was under 
construction, all under the name of a distant cousin of Shizuru&#39;s. Aya 
called repeatedly, but for Shizuru, it had to be the end.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Shizuru had told her. &quot;I&#39;m very glad we were able to spend 
such time together, but a family emergency has surfaced and it requires 
immediate attention. I need to be alone and I need to devote my time to 
that goal. Forgive me. I will no longer be attending classes.&quot;

- - -

Natsuki had felt very naked without her Elements. She felt even more 
vulnerable knowing that she was being tracked down. A few weeks passed. 
Yukino had tracked the program to the computer devices belonging to Mai, 
Natsuki and Akane. More followed. Land line phones had been tapped, she 
had discovered. Black SUVs were found hovering around Linden Baum, 
Fuuka, and Kyoto U. This was not good. She needed firepower.

Sakomizu pulled out a recently acquired case, Natsuki laying money down 
on the table next to him. She had paid for most of it. The rest, he was 
willing to provide. Because he cared about her. If Tanya was a mother 
figure, Sakomizu was the closest thing she had to a real father. The 
real one wanted nothing to do with her. He unlatched the case and opened 
it.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t able to get those short barreled Pythons you wanted just yet. 
Besides, they probably aren&#39;t as easy to fire on short notice.&quot; The 
afro-haired teacher pulled a single black pistol out of the case and 
held it up. &quot;They&#39;re old and second hand, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find a way 
to perfect them. The Desert Eagles are heavy, and the revolvers would 
suit you better, but they&#39;ll have to do.&quot;

Heavy, huh? Yeah, well, she was HiME. It was nothing. She peered into 
the case. Two of them, plus a few extra magazines. She took the one from 
Sakomizu, testing its weight. She&#39;d never really used a handgun quite 
the size. Her Elements were small little featherweights, and she&#39;d only 
ever really held a Glock before that. It was an adjustment she could 
easily make. A few trips to the firing range would get her in top 
condition.

&quot;Thank you, Afro-san.&quot;

He watched her silently place the guns back in the case, latching it 
again. She went through all her old patterns of battle preparation, like 
she was off to prevent a HiME from entering Fuuka or off to slay an 
Orphan. She just sit there with those Elements for hours, firing them 
into logs or other targets in the middle of nowhere, training herself to 
have perfect aim. She&#39;d no doubt be going through far too many magazines 
in a short time to grow used to the new weapons.

He frowned. &quot;I wish I knew something. Because I really don&#39;t. This 
monitoring must come from above first district, straight from the Searrs 
suits. I&#39;d hoped you wouldn&#39;t have to fight again after the Carnival.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Natsuki said, locking the final latch, &quot;it&#39;s a bit difficult to 
destroy an entire organization, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;ll manage.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t stay a stranger. I&#39;ll dig into the Searrs database as far as I 
can. Maybe I&#39;ll find something. I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t get your friend 
Yukino access as well,&quot; he offered.

She picked up the case and headed to the door, smiling softly. &quot;Thank 
you. I mean it.&quot;

The door was opened and shut hastily, Natsuki heading back out onto the 
street, already on her cellphone in an attempt to contact someone else. 
She had to reestablish all her old links, after all. It was back to the 
beginning of all things, though she now felt she had something much more 
vital to protect. Dance the dance of death once again, fair princesses.

November 2009

A message had been left on Tanya&#39;s machine that prompted both women into 
further action. The switching of identities had to happen right then and 
there. There was no time left to give to preparing. It was Kaori. That 
in itself was bad enough, but the very first thing she said froze both 
Tanya and Shizuru in their tracks as they moved about the elder woman&#39;s 
home.

&quot;Tanya, this is Kaori. As I am still Shizuru&#39;s legal guardian, I have 
received a most interesting phone call from the Fuuka City Police 
Department.&quot; Her voice was restrained. Shizuru could sense that Kaori 
was livid. Her breath caught. &quot;It seems that your niece is wanted for 
questioning regarding the disappearance of several people from Fuuka. 
They&#39;re saying she may actually be responsible.&quot;

Even as Kaori continued to rant, bags were being frantically packed. 
&quot;What a fine job you did, raising a sociopath, Tanya. I knew something 
was wrong with that damn mix right from the start. All the fighting and 
the rage. Violent blood mixed into a line that was never to have such 
tendencies...&quot;

Shizuru ripped the phone cord right out of the socket.

Natsuki was in a new apartment. She was watching the news, which she had 
now taken to doing to see if anything looked at all odd, as if a story 
was nothing more than a lie to cover up something else. School books sat 
on her table. She was still attending, still going to class. No need to 
fuck that up when there wasn&#39;t a present threat yet.

A new report. &quot;A high speed car wreck in Kobe occurred tonight, 
resulting in a potentially fatal crash. The car of Fujino Shizuru, 
daughter of the late Fujino Shin, lost control and plowed into Kobe 
Harbor. The harbor is being dredged for any sign of the car or 
passengers. No traces of survivors have been found. The car was being 
pursued by members of the Kobe Police Department, the young woman wanted 
for questioning regarding a yet to be disclosed manner...&quot;

Natsuki bolted up and scrambled for her cellphone. That was not how 
Shizuru&#39;s plan was supposed to go. Not in Kobe Harbor. Not in a fucking 
cop chase. She fumbled with the phone as she searched for Shizuru&#39;s name 
in the memory. Oh, god. She hit send and paced about her house like a 
caged tiger while the phone rang. If it had been submerged, would it 
even work? She sighed shakily, ready to grab her helmet and storm out. 
God damn cops were probably bought off by Searrs.

Pick up, pick up, pick up.

At long last, the phone clicked on and the ringing was replaced by a 
breathless Kyoto woman, another voice in the background. &quot;Natsuki?&quot;

&quot;Shizuru! Where are you? Are you all right? I just caught the news.&quot;

&quot;Fujino Shizuru is not here, you remember. She&#39;s somewhere in Kobe 
Harbor, remember? Ara, I made it on the news? Oh, my.&quot; The voice was 
rapidly gaining breath, but remained, for some reason, lighthearted 
despite all that had happened. Natsuki wanted to tackle her to the 
ground and beat her senseless. &quot;I&#39;m fine, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m in Kyoto now. 
Soaking wet and near freezing, as is Tanya, but we&#39;re Russian. Cold is 
fine.&quot;

&quot;The both of you owe me greatly for all of this. No more adventures!&quot; 
Tanya said in the background, lamenting over a ruined sweater and 
complaining of icicles on her nose.

&quot;Shizuru,&quot; Natsuki addressed, her heart finally recovering, &quot;go to your 
new house and stay there. Call me the second you need help or see 
anything odd. What name are you going to go by now?&quot;

&quot;Kashima Sayo. I will call on you if I need help.&quot; The response was 
genuine and soft. &quot;Do the same if you are in trouble. Please take care. 
I&#39;ll let you know when I&#39;m settled in.&quot;

Natsuki was still mad at her for all those accusations. But that 
fleeting moment when she had genuinely thought she had died, and the 
threat of Searrs around them, had pushed her back her mask once again. 
She&#39;d said the words before. Sometimes as a friend. Once as a slight bit 
more than that, perhaps. &quot;Call me as soon as possible, then. Goodbye. I 
love you.&quot;

Silence. It was still said as if it were platonic love, but it was 
emotional and touching none the less, perhaps simply because those words 
were seldom said. Replying in a similar manner, going only off of her 
sisterly and friendly love, she said, &quot;I love you too, Natsuki.&quot;

Natsuki, at that moment, wanted to hold her. Just to make sure she 
really was alive.

- - -

She sat in a room that greatly felt like a solitary confinement jail 
cell. Her body, toned but not yet properly conditioned as a soldier 
(they would fix that), was cold and uncomfortable. She had no place else 
to go, however. She had no home, and no family. She&#39;d been working for 
them off and on to make a little cash. Funny. She hadn&#39;t even been out 
of high school long and she was already involved with something so 
underhanded and filthy. This was her only chance to live like something 
other than an abandoned dog on the street.

&quot;State your name, please.&quot; English, as opposed to the native Japanese 
tongue.

&quot;Allison Knight.&quot;

&quot;How... lovely,&quot; a blonde man said with a slight laugh. &quot;Yes, you&#39;re 
lovely. Your background checks out perfectly. You&#39;re just what we&#39;re 
looking for.&quot;

By that he meant: unknown, unwanted, and athletic enough to be hardened 
into a super soldier. She managed a small smile. &quot;Thank you, sir.&quot;

&quot;Before we go too far ahead with the Otome project, we&#39;d like for you to 
run several small operations here and there to help acquire potential 
targets of opportunity before the first robe is completed. You&#39;re 
willing to help us with that, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;

AN: A quick line in the first chapter of Kyoto Hunt indicated Shizuru 
faked her death six months before Natsuki did. Ha, okay, maybe you do 
kind of need to be a little familiar with that first chapter of KH to 
get the entire events that are unfolding. Ah, well, after this it&#39;s just 
them. Alone. In the woods. Grr, baby.</pre>
