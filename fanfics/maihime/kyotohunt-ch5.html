<h1>The Kyoto Hunt (part 5 of 11)</h1>

A gunmetal APC pulled off to the side of a dirt path outside of Kyoto, 
the driver pausing on request. The tech guy on board wanted to give the 
equipment on board a minor adjustment. So, there it sat, it&#39;s other 
occupants waiting impatiently. The Emulator had not overloaded, but it 
was stressed none the less, Lapis frequent use of her robe and Element 
having worn it down. For the Otome, it seemed they spent as much time 
tinkering with that experimental device as they did actually using it in 
combat. Perhaps even more so. Hopefully in the next few months they 
would get it perfected. The Doctor promised upgrades within the week. 
Then again, he had been known to lie and get their hopes up on more than 
one occasion. To him, the morale of his soldiers was not nearly as 
important as his devices.

As the vehicle was stopped and the occupants busied themselves, a 
solitary figure clad in leather &#150; a dark color in stark contrast to 
milky white skin &#150; slipped out from the undergrowth beside the road. Her 
footsteps were unheard, each step placed in an area of least resistance. 
She fixed her eyes on the vehicle for a short moment, as if calculating 
something. Moving to the side of the vehicle after the driver was no 
longer fixated on the mirrors, she held out her arm.

Fingers and synthetic flesh transformed back, allowing a different mode 
to take over, a large blade taking their place. The giant cleaver, fixed 
onto her elbow joint, was hefted into the air and then brought back down 
at lightning fast, inhuman speed. The metal tore through the armor of 
the APC, its sharpness and precision that great. She&#39;d aimed for dead 
center, her enhanced vision having targeted that section in particular. 
The vehicle was torn asunder and the two sides lurched forward with the 
absence of the support the other provided. She twisted her arm, prying 
the two sides of the sliced armored carrier apart.

It allowed her access to the inside, and allowed the occupants to 
escape. Two young men in suits fled down the dirt path at top speed. 
She&#39;d deal with them in a moment, if need be. Three women stood to face 
her, all tapping a gem earring in unison. The women instantly summoned 
their robes and then materialized their respective weapons. So, Lapis 
was not truly alone. The others must have been waiting in the wings in 
case she needed support. They were attempting to form up around her in a 
predetermined battle position.

&quot;The Yggdrasil unit,&quot; Onyx confirmed after giving her a look over. &quot;Use 
caution.&quot;

Damn right you&#39;d better use caution.

The first feeble attempt to take her down was made by Topaz, who swung 
her mace out towards her head. She held up her arm blade and watched the 
weapon coil around it. Unlike Shizuru, her strength was more than enough 
to end any kind of tug of war in an instant. She took a step back and 
pulled, the mace going with her. Topaz disarmed, and the mace sliding 
off the blade after a perfect shake of her arm, she switched modes and 
let another take over. Her arm transformed accordingly.

A grenade round was launched from that very arm and was sent crashing to 
the ground right in front of Lapis, who was still too tired to properly 
evade. The round exploded and she was flung to the ground, her robe 
damaged and her lungs empty. Onyx, the last one standing, wasted no time 
in attacking her. She switched back to blade mode. The Otome&#39;s staff and 
her arm clashed repeatedly, all while her eyes scanned the wreckage of 
the vehicle. Ah. There it was.

With a mighty swing of her arm, she tossed Onyx back and leapt towards 
the APC&#39;s latter half. There, she pierced a particular device with her 
arm, impaling it on the end of the blade. It sparked and lights on the 
side faded away. She turned back to the other three with her ever 
present look of neutrality, and watched as their robes began to flicker. 
All three looked quite panicked. Imagine that. The robes and Elements 
de-materialized a second later, the Otome left helpless.

&quot;Run!&quot; Onyx commanded, staying behind for just a moment to ensure her 
teammates got a head start and were in the clear. But she wasn&#39;t going 
to attack. She had completed her task. So she let Onyx and the others 
go, termination not even a tertiary objective on her mission.

Instead, she gazed down at the device impaled on her arm blade, raising 
an eyebrow in curiosity. She could analyze it well, certainly, but the 
exact use of it was beyond her. Clearly, she needed additional support. 
There was only one person who could have determined the use of the 
device, and so she looked back towards Kyoto&#39;s skyline, and began to 
march.

- - -

The whole fiasco was done with, and in the early hours of the morning, 
Haruka collapsed on the couch within her apartment downtown. After a 
long moment of just sitting there, she turned on the television, very 
glad that she had Fridays off. She propped both feet onto her coffee 
table, kept so organized by her cleanly roommate, and simply sat back 
and watched the television, not even caring what was on. Where was that 
roommate of hers, anyway? Surely she had gotten off work by now. The 
JSDF had likely gone to graveyard so late in the night.

The door opened, and Haruka held up a hand in greeting. &quot;Hey, Yukino. 
How was life in th- &quot;

Instead of being greeted by her more timid roommate, a large hunk of 
metal dropped onto the couch next to her. She turned around and saw only 
a giant, brilliant blade. Holy crap almighty. Miyu stared at Haruka for 
what seemed like an eternity, the usually loudmouthed officer unable to 
think of something to scream. Miyu shifted her arm back to normal, and 
gently crossed it with her other one. So, Yukino was not there, then? A 
mild disappointment, but it was not the end of the world.

&quot;I trust you will give this to Kikukawa-san. Do not damage it further. 
Tell her to determine its function and respond to me.&quot; With that cold 
order, Miyu pivoted around and headed for the door. Opening it, she 
added, &quot;I may be contacted at 1395 Takamori Avenue.&quot;

When Miyu shut the door, Haruka miraculously found her voice. &quot;Wait, 
what is it?! Hey. Hey! You can&#39;t just leave me here with that kind of 
pathetic explanation! Come back!&quot;

There was no answer. Haruka gulped and gazed at the filthy hunk of metal 
next to her, covered in dirt and sporting a healthy hole in the middle 
of it. Well, why did Miyu make it a shish kabob in the first place if 
she didn&#39;t want it damaged? Damn it all, it was getting mud on her 
couch. But she shouldn&#39;t touch it. Should she? How could she damage it 
any more than it already was? So, braving it, she clamped both hands 
around it and picked it up, walking towards the kitchen counter. But 
that mud made it a little... slippery.

So, halfway there, the device crashed to the tiled floor, the top 
snapping off. Haruka stared at it in shock, feeling beads of sweat form 
on her palms. Miyu was going to murder her in her sleep and then parade 
around with her head impaled on that arm blade. She mustered the courage 
to move, however. She could fix it! She planted the main device and the 
part that popped off onto the counter, pulling up a stool and retrieving 
a few tools from a nearby drawer.

Except Haruka had actually gotten low marks in shop class. She wasn&#39;t 
any good with gadgets like her friend was. In fact, Yukino had been the 
only way she had passed that class. She examined both pieces of the 
device and decided, at long last, that she would only break it more if 
she tried to fix it. As was the case with most things she tried to fix. 
So, there was only one true way for Haruka to solve this little 
conundrum.

A combination of masking and duct tape situated the broken piece back 
where it had been. Haruka nodded. There we go. Feeling mildly 
triumphant, she smiled as the door opened again, waving to a tired 
looking Yukino, who stared back at her in mild worry. Electronics and 
duct tape. What had Haruka done now? Yukino dropped her coat and bag 
next to the door, not bothering to pick them up. She came to stand on 
the opposite side of the counter, and expected an explanation.

&quot;Miyu wants you to figure out what it does,&quot; Haruka informed. &quot;I think 
she meant quick-like.&quot;

Yukino already knew where the android had gotten it. It had been Yukino 
that gave Miyu&#39;s neural network access to the JSDF satellite network 
that had been tracking the Otome down, in a last ditch effort to have 
someone face off against them before they could escape. Yukino slowly 
nodded and sat, but Haruka shook her head after a moment, deciding that 
Yukino was simply much too tired to deal with it. The lieutenant stood 
and ushered Yukino towards the hacker&#39;s room, pointing at it.

&quot;Go to bed, Yukino. Deal with it in the morning.&quot; The command was 
certainly one meant to be final.

Yukino adjusted her glasses, having slid down her face on the way home. 
&quot;But...&quot;

Haruka glared back at her, though it was not a glare of irritation. It 
was one of mere stubbornness, though a distinct hint of caring could be 
seen underneath. It was simply illogical to fight with Haruka. She won 
every time, regardless of who she was facing off against. Except perhaps 
the former kaichou, but that was something never to be brought up. So, 
Yukino conceded.

&quot;Good night, Haruka-chan,&quot; she said.

The lieutenant nodded in approval and replied in kind, leaving Yukino to 
herself. The blonde retired back to the couch and television, while 
Yukino shut the door and briefly leaned against it with a defeated sigh. 
One day.

- - -

Yukino rose at dawn, only a few hours after going to bed in the first 
place. Haruka slept until noon. During the course of the morning and 
afternoon, Yukino ripped the Otome device apart, analyzed every wire and 
component, and wrote up a very professional report about what it could 
and could not do. By the time she had finished her extra work, however, 
it was time for her to go back to her real job. Not having enough time 
to track down Miyu&#39;s address and deliver the device and report to her, 
she called a familiar someone, not trusting Haruka to transport the 
device safely.

Nao stared blankly at Yukino for several moments while the other woman 
explained what she wanted done. &quot;Just bring this to Miyu and hand her 
the report. Everything should be in order. I&#39;m running late for work, 
though. Can you do it? Please, Nao?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; Hell no.

Yukino smiled, and checked her watch. Her smile faded into a worried 
look, and she ran back to her car. Climbing in, the hacker drove away 
rapidly, and Nao found herself looking at both the report and duct taped 
device. She attempted to read, but the language was too full of 
technical jargon for her to make heads or tails of it. Nao was not an 
errand girl. She did not feel like playing the part, either. So what sap 
could she pass this job off on? The university was too long a walk away. 
That ruled out Akira, Takumi or Shiho. She didn&#39;t know where Mai lived. 
Shizuru was in the MHI complex &#150; strictly off limits to Nao. Midori was 
probably drunk. Which left...

&quot;Yuuki.&quot;

&quot;Kuga.&quot;

She hated walking into that filth ridden garage, but it housed the 
closest HiME to her at the time. Nao had to do what Nao had to do. Get 
out of work, that was. Natsuki held a wrench in one hand, and had grease 
splattered across a few portions of her face. Obviously busy, which made 
Nao&#39;s interruption all the more entertaining. Besides, Natsuki was a 
gearhead. Maybe she understood half of the stuff Yukino had wrote down.

&quot;Need you to bring these things to Miyu at 1395 Takamori Avenue. Have 
fun.&quot; Nao dropped the device onto one of those flea infested couches, 
and sat the report next to it.

&quot;I&#39;m a little busy.&quot;

&quot;You get off work in an hour. Do it then,&quot; Nao argued.

&quot;Why should I?&quot; Natsuki tapped the wrench against her other hand 
impatiently.

Nao pointed to the device. &quot;Because, glorious leader, that is a piece of 
Otome equipment that Yukino&#39;s been researching. Miyu wants it. See? It&#39;s 
for the cause. Long live the revolution.&quot;

Natsuki&#39;s expression changed somewhat. That did it. Well, almost. She 
was going to put up one final fight before conceding. &quot;You don&#39;t have a 
job and you got kicked out of school. What could possibly be interfering 
with your ability to walk to the other side of town?&quot;

&quot;Dropped out willingly, Kuga, and you&#39;re certainly one to talk about 
scholastic setbacks,&quot; Nao countered. Round one. Fight!

&quot;A setback is different from a failure. I actually finished my 
schooling, thank you.&quot; Hadoken!

&quot;You finished high school two years late and then did some redneck 
mechanic class. I got through high school on the honor roll and actually 
attempted to go to a university.&quot; Tiger uppercut!

&quot;Yes, well, I can see how school might get in the way of tying men up in 
dark alleys.&quot; Shoryuken!

&quot;I can see how work might get in the way of tying up Fujino.&quot; Tiger 
shot!

K.O.!

Natsuki grimaced and then smacked the wrench against her other hand 
roughly, gripping it in anger. &quot;Fine! I&#39;ll do it. Get out of here, 
you&#39;re distracting me.&quot;

Nao chuckled. How sweet victory was. Especially when it was against her 
little rival. &quot;Yes, I know you can&#39;t help but marvel at my gorgeous body 
now that I&#39;m legal. Do try to control yourself.&quot;

&quot;This wrench is going to be bashing your skull in if you don&#39;t get out 
of here, Nao,&quot; Natsuki said with a glare. Her boss was beginning to 
motion that she should get back to work and stop talking with whatever 
girl she was seeing this week. Or something like that.

Nao gave a final wave and sauntered out the door like nothing was wrong. 
It wasn&#39;t, really. Their bickering was like a normal person&#39;s 
conversation. Inwardly, the pair liked it, though neither would ever 
admit to it. Natsuki looked back down at the little gadget, noting the 
duct tape and correctly assuming Haruka had something to do with it. 
Otome device, eh? She was tempted to pick up the report, but her filthy 
hands prevented it. She carefully put the device and report into her 
little locker a room away, and returned to finish work. She only had an 
hour left to go. At five, she clocked out, and she finally sat down to 
read the report as the other workers left the garage.

It was all technobabble. She did not speak the language at all, unless 
it referred to engines or transmissions in some way. Not pursuing that 
venture any further, lest she find herself with a headache, she folded 
the report and pocketed it. The Otome device was strapped to the end of 
her bike, and with that, she took off to find the address. A quick stop 
at a kiosk and a trip to google maps later, she was on her way. It took 
her about fifteen minutes to reach the area, and another five to 
actually find the house in question.

The place was a well maintained home in the region that she and Shizuru 
had been thinking of moving to, actually. The gate was unlocked, so she 
opened it and walked to the door, Otome device in hand. Adjusting it, 
she freed an arm and knocked on the door. It was dutifully opened a few 
moments later, but not by Miyu. Instead, Natsuki was greeted by a 
fourteen year old blonde girl with icy eyes and a demure expression. It 
changed, but only slightly, after she saw who the visitor was. A kind 
smile replaced the previous look, and she held the door open wider.

Alyssa Searrs, almost all grown up. &quot;Natsuki-san, please come inside!&quot;

The blonde teenager retreated indoors, and Natsuki followed, still not 
quite adjusting to how the other girl had grown. She truly hadn&#39;t kept 
in contact with Miyu or Alyssa much, though that was hardly her fault. 
Miyu moved frequently and in secret, even refusing to tell the HiMEs her 
location. Alyssa stood a little taller than Natsuki&#39;s shoulder, dressed 
in a button up and elegant white blouse, her hair cut just around under 
the jaw line. She walked into a small study where few books and a cup of 
tea rested on a table. The room looked very Victorian, perhaps a 
personal preference on Alyssa&#39;s part. She hadn&#39;t grown up in Japan.

She motioned for Natsuki to sit. &quot;Would you like some tea? I have more.&quot;

No, Natsuki had enough tea at home to last her five lifetimes. She sat 
down in the offered high backed chair. &quot;That&#39;s all right. Is Miyu here?&quot;

Alyssa shook her head. &quot;No, she went out for a moment. I needed 
something for school, so she offered to get it for me. She should be 
back in a few minutes.&quot;

The two females fell into an uncomfortable silence, both having trouble 
finding words. Talking was neither girl&#39;s strong suit. It was Natsuki 
who managed to break the silence, asking a fairly generic follow up 
question. It was the best she could do, though even with that she 
stumbled a bit with the words. &quot;So... homework? What are you studying?&quot;

&quot;A few subjects for an AP Calculus course. My graphing calculator broke, 
so Miyu is out fetching another one,&quot; Alyssa said with a small shrug, 
sitting down in the opposing chair and taking a sip of tea.

Natsuki nearly dropped her jaw. &quot;AP Calculus? I didn&#39;t even take that as 
a senior. They offer that to students in junior high?&quot;

Alyssa shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m at Ritsumeikan University. They made an 
exception for me since I got high marks on their entrance exams. I&#39;m 
supposed to be working on one of my final assignments, but the 
calculator breaking only added to my distraction. Never put a television 
in your study.&quot;

Natsuki followed Alyssa&#39;s gaze to a small flat screen television mounted 
on the wall behind her. Standing up, she examined the DVD case resting 
on a nearby shelf, the movie paused at a place where Natsuki could not 
recognize it. Upon seeing the case, however, she smirked and even 
managed a small laugh. How unexpected. &quot;From Russia With Love?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Alyssa replied. &quot;What? You don&#39;t approve?&quot;

This kid was cool. Not many of the other HiMEs were willing to sit down 
and watch these kind of movies with her. Possibly Shizuru if Natsuki 
caught her on a good day. &quot;No, trust me, I approve. I haven&#39;t seen any 
of the movies in ages, but I used to be addicted to Bond when I was 
younger. But, uh, right, not when you&#39;re studying. You got into Ritsu? 
That&#39;s very impressive. I wish I was as gifted in academics. I&#39;m just a 
working class girl, I suppose.&quot;

&quot;Thanks. It&#39;s a lot of work, though.&quot; Alyssa noted that Natsuki had her 
eyes fixed on the television. A bit distracted, much? &quot;Is this one your 
favorite, then?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Oh, yeah, it is.&quot; Why was Natsuki always so jumpy when it came to 
talking with the youth of Japan?

&quot;Do you want to watch it?&quot; Alyssa was practically laughing at the older 
girl for being so obsessed with the paused image and the DVD case. 
Natsuki didn&#39;t respond at first, but Alyssa moved over and pressed the 
play button anyway. The scene continued by completing the paused action 
and then going into the rest of the scene. Natsuki was kind of anxious 
to see it, but crossed her arms after hearing something she hadn&#39;t quite 
expected.

&quot;It&#39;s in English.&quot; Natsuki did not speak English beyond simple greetings 
and phrases, thanks to school requirements. Curses. Not even any 
subtitles.

Alyssa laughed. &quot;Oh, right. Sorry, I forgot. I grew up with both 
languages, so I have DVDs from both regions of the world.&quot;

Natsuki paused it again. No use if she couldn&#39;t understand. &quot;Where were 
you born, anyway?&quot;

&quot;In Japan,&quot; Alyssa answered, &quot;but I was frequently abroad, usually in 
England. Never in public, of course, but in foreign facilities, and had 
several English-speaking caretakers. I had to attempt to learn the 
language when I was very young because of that, usually through my own 
methods. My father liked to keep me moving around, for safety&#39;s sake.&quot;

&quot;Father?&quot;

Alyssa smiled bitterly. &quot;The CEO of Searrs, at least during the 
Carnival. He wasn&#39;t my biological father, but was my guardian. One of 
the only men who was kind to me, until, of course...&quot;

Natsuki was dense, but not enough to fail to understand that Alyssa did 
not want to speak about the foundation that had ordered her to be 
euthanized. So Natsuki averted her gaze and changed the subject. She 
could talk to Miyu about the less than pleasant subjects. &quot;You ever been 
to Germany?&quot;

&quot;Once, when I was seven. I went to Berlin for the summer. Why?&quot; She 
looked rightfully puzzled until something in her mind clicked. She 
laughed slightly and then smiled, &quot;Oh, you mean to ask about the...&quot;

&quot;Autobahn.&quot; Natsuki finished, a smirk inadvertently forming on her lips. 
&quot;I&#39;ve always wondered what it was like. I&#39;d like to go there someday to 
just have the chance to ride my bike on it.&quot;

&quot;I was on it, actually, though I didn&#39;t see much. I was young, so it was 
a bit intimidating at the time, although still fun. Lots of German 
sports cars racing by at blinding speeds. I&#39;m sure you&#39;d like it.&quot; She 
paused, then, crossing her arms. &quot;Though that reminds me...&quot;

&quot;Hm?&quot; Natsuki prodded, still flipping the DVD case in her hands absent 
mindedly, a force of habit.

&quot;No, never mind. It&#39;s nothing.&quot; Alyssa looked positively flustered, and 
flipped through her textbook after sitting back down. Apparently she had 
a similar nervous habit, needed to distract herself.

&quot;The Autobahn reminded you of nothing?&quot; Natsuki countered. &quot;Might as 
well speak up. Too late now.&quot;

Alyssa looked back up, then fixated her gaze on Natsuki&#39;s shoes, not 
able to look her in the face. &quot;I&#39;ve been meaning to ask if you would be 
willing to let me go on a bike ride with you. I like machines and 
vehicles. It looks fun. If you don&#39;t mind, that is.&quot;

James Bond and motorcycles. Yes, this kid was indeed cool. Natsuki was 
smiling inwardly, and was now feeling comfortable around the younger 
girl for the first time. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s fine. I&#39;m not doing anything after 
this. You want to go for a quick ride after I get done talking with 
Miyu? Just around the block or something. So not to interfere with your 
homework.&quot;

Alyssa smiled, relieved that Natsuki was not upset by the request, and 
finally looked up at her. &quot;I&#39;d like that!&quot;

&quot;Anyway, you should study.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s rude to do something else while there&#39;s a guest in the home,&quot; 
Alyssa protested.

Natsuki pointed to the book. &quot;Homework is an exception.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have my graphing calculator.&quot;

&quot;You can read about theorems or equations or whatever the hell that 
class is about. Or you can review what you&#39;ve already done.&quot; She was not 
going to let this kid slack off like she had. There was still hope for 
the little blonde Searrs prodigy. Unfortunately, she seemed just as 
stubborn as Natsuki.

&quot;I already did that. Turn the movie back on.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Give me the remote, then.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Kuga held her arm up as close she could to the ceiling, keeping 
the remote out of reach. In theory, anyway. Christ, she felt like a ten 
year old. Alyssa could have easily broke for the actual television, but 
like any child of the digital age, the remote was the only known device 
to work anything. So, a friendly fight began.

- - -

Miyu walked through the door holding a small plastic bag containing a 
sealed calculator, the exact kind that Alyssa had requested. Her 
sensitive &#145;ears&#39; detected what sounded like a scuffle coming from the 
study, and Miyu instantly dropped the bag on the floor and raced in to 
save Alyssa from whoever was attacking her. She flung the door open 
again and then paused as she saw the scene in front of her, her 
targeting software registering that the situation was not a hostile 
quarrel.

There she saw a grown woman wrestling with a teenager over the 
possession of a remote control, both occasionally yelping something in 
protest. Natsuki had Alyssa in a headlock, but soon found herself pinned 
to the ground by the fourteen year old, obviously not using her true 
muscle against the younger girl. Miyu stared at the scene for quite a 
while before she cleared her throat loudly, Alyssa looking up and then 
pausing. Natsuki tilted her head back and paused as well.

The biker managed to wave. &quot;Hello, Miyu.&quot;

&quot;Natsuki, a teenager has defeated you in the field of combat. Are you 
feeling ill?&quot; Miyu asked.

&quot;I let her.&quot; Natsuki kicked Alyssa off of her and stood up, fixing her 
jacket. She changed subjects before the situation could grow any worse. 
&quot;I&#39;m dropping off the device you gave Yukino, complete with her report. 
Sorry, I don&#39;t really know what it says. But I&#39;m sure you can 
understand.&quot;

Natsuki removed the piece of paper from her jacket pocket and handed it 
over. Miyu unfolded it and read it in it&#39;s entirety within a few quick 
seconds. &quot;Indeed. Thank you.&quot;

She waited for further explanation. It did not come. Both Natsuki and 
Alyssa looked to each other before turning back. The biker pressed on. 
&quot;So... what is it? Was it the Emulator?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Miyu replied. &quot;It was a router, so to speak. The Emulator is in a 
fixed location somewhere, but has a limited global range. These devices 
allow for remote use of the Otome equipment. They always have one with 
them during their operations. If you can find it and destroy it during a 
fight, they will be powerless.&quot;

Natsuki nodded. &quot;I see. Do you know anything about the Otome? There 
weren&#39;t other girls born into the Valkyrie project, were there?&quot;

&quot;There were 142 other fetuses used for the experiment, but none 
survived. I am not familiar with any other girls in similar projects. I 
did not have free reign in Searrs, however. Perhaps they Otome project 
was originally conducted abroad and only now transferred to the Japan 
facilities.&quot;

&quot;If you know where the facilities are, I was a list of addresses,&quot; 
Natsuki demanded. Alyssa kept looking between the two of them, feeling a 
little lost but wanting to be kept inform of what was going on. She was 
old enough now, surely. Several of the HiMEs had been her age during the 
Carnival, after all.

Miyu paused, contemplating. &quot;I will email them to you.&quot;

&quot;Thank y-&quot;

&quot;Message has been sent.&quot;

Natsuki nodded slowly. Right. Computer brain. She kept forgetting. 
&quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;Not a problem. I will now be replying to email inquiries if you send 
them. With reason, however.&quot; Miyu walked back out of the room, Natsuki 
getting out of her way. She returned a moment later, holding the bag she 
had originally come in with. She handed it over to Alyssa, who accepted 
it with a courteous nod. Miyu nodded towards the textbooks. &quot;Please 
return to your schoolwork, Alyssa-chan.&quot;

Alyssa shook her head. &quot;If you two are done, then Natsuki said she would 
take me for a bike ride.&quot;

&quot;But you have work,&quot; Miyu protested. She looked to Natsuki. &quot;How far do 
you intend to go?&quot;

&quot;Just around the block. She can wear my helmet,&quot; Natsuki replied. &quot;It 
won&#39;t take long.&quot;

Miyu seemed to give silent permission, since Alyssa hugged her and then 
headed towards the door. Natsuki followed her outside and headed towards 
the bike. She picked her helmet off of the rear seat and then handed it 
to Alyssa, helping her fasten it and get it properly adjusted to 
accommodate her. Once secured, she climbed onto the bike, and motioned 
for Alyssa to follow suit. The girl hopped on, the bike feeling taller 
than it looked. With a few moments, she seemed to have gotten herself 
situated. Natsuki pointed where to put her feet, and with Miyu watching 
from the doorway, Natsuki backed up, then pulled onto the main street.

She took it slow at first, but with a verbal command from Alyssa, she 
sped up a reasonable amount once she hit a desolate straightaway, the 
girl cheering with delight at the increase in speed. The trip around the 
block was quick but that was enough for Alyssa apparently. When she 
returned and entered the driveway. The blonde teen climbed off the bike 
and returned the borrowed helmet. Miyu had apparently retreated inside 
while they were gone.

&quot;We can go on a longer trip next time,&quot; Natsuki promised, sliding the 
helmet back onto her own head. &quot;Sorry this one was short, but you have 
work to do.&quot;

&quot;It was just fine. Thanks, Natsuki onee-sama,&quot; Alyssa replied, causing 
the older girl to scoff at the term. So formal.

Natsuki fastened her helmet, smiling a tad bit underneath now that 
Alyssa could not see. &quot;Miyu has my number. Call me when you don&#39;t have 
finals at that prestigious university of yours, and we&#39;ll see about 
going out, then.&quot;

Alyssa nodded. &quot;Sure. Have a nice evening. Drive safe.&quot;

&quot;Bye, kid.&quot;

Natsuki again backed up the bike and headed onto the street. Instead of 
just casually driving away, though, seeing that Alyssa was still 
watching, she decided to showboat. Rapidly hitting the accelerator and 
leaning back, she popped the bike into a wheelie and stormed down the 
street at top speed, the engine at a deafening, squealing roar. The 
neighbors may not have liked it, and while she couldn&#39;t see Alyssa, she 
hoped the display had at least been mildly entertaining. As she drove 
on, her face fell into a frown. When did she care what younger people 
thought? She put her game face back on, going back into traditional 
Kuga-mode.

Nao walked down the street in a commercial district of the city, keeping 
her eyes on the passersby and spending her time people watching. 
Triumphant due to her victory over Kuga, her step had an extra bounce to 
it. She passed by a stand selling potato chips and snack foods, grabbing 
a bag from the stand while the owner was not looking. Tossing a few into 
her mouth, she continued to glance around, until she ran into a familiar 
face. Nao had a few buddies she ran with sometimes, hitting bars or 
causing mayhem, though she was close to none of them. He waved at her, 
and she was compelled to speak.

&quot;Hey, Yuuki. Some of us are going to Blue Heaven. You in?&quot; He asked, 
referring to a frequent hangout. It was a bar down the street.

She shook her head. &quot;I&#39;ll take a rain check. Call me tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try, that&#39;s for sure.&quot; He smacked his phone against the wall of 
the building next to them. &quot;Thing&#39;s been acting up lately. So have all 
my electronics, actually. Guess something&#39;s interfering with them. Sun 
spot, I guess.&quot;

Nao shrugged. &quot;Whatever. I haven&#39;t noticed anything.&quot;

With the brawler obviously in no mood to talk, her friend excused 
himself and then headed down the street to the bar he had mentioned. Nao 
leaned against the building beside her, looping her fingers around the 
belt holding up her leather pants. There she stood for several long 
moments. She didn&#39;t remember when she had been so into people watching. 
It probably started with her trying to locate the dredges of society 
preying on young women, and had progressed into a genuine interest in 
the behavior of other people. She didn&#39;t care about their conversations. 
She didn&#39;t care who they were. She did care, however, about their body 
language and actions. Something about it was fascinating.

And it was during her systematic observation that she noticed a certain 
someone purchasing something from a nearby stand. Nao squinted. She 
looked so familiar. Perhaps someone from high school or university? No, 
that wasn&#39;t it. She stood up all the way, not obsessed with finding out 
who it was. The movements, the way she was speaking, even if she 
couldn&#39;t hear her. Then it hit her. There, standing some odd dozen feet 
from her and dressed in casual clothes, was Lapis. She was sure of it.

So, Nao followed behind the Otome in casual garb. The tall blonde ended 
up going behind a building and into an alley. Perfect! When the two were 
alone in the alley, Lapis naturally began to pick up on the sound of 
Nao&#39;s footsteps. She stopped and slowly turned, not even registering 
that it was Yuuki at first. But Nao held up her hand and waved her 
fingers, a smirk on her face.

&quot;Well, well, even you get a day off every now and then, hm?&quot; Nao asked.

Lapis said nothing, dropping the bag containing the item she just 
purchased. She had a long coat on, and slowly slipped it off from her 
shoulders, a clear sign of coming aggression. &quot;Yuuki.&quot;

&quot;Oh, are you going to fight with me?&quot; Nao asked. &quot;My, you&#39;d better watch 
yourself, then. Last time you tried to take me on, it ended poorly on 
your part. Unless, of course, you&#39;ve been practicing.&quot;

&quot;That,&quot; Lapis said, &quot;was without my robe.&quot;

She tapped her ear and in an instant, she was back in her Otome uniform. 
She did not yet materialize her bow, however. That was more than enough 
for Nao to start a fight. It was a stupid move, really. She was taking 
on a fully powered Otome woman by herself, and no other HiME knew about 
it. She had no backup, no witnesses to put an end to the fight if it got 
out of hand, and was fighting the one who hated her the most. She could 
have been kidnapped or left for dead and no one would ever know. But she 
was Nao. How could she lose? So, with no hesitation what so ever, she 
charged forward, extending the blades on her gloves.

Lapis grabbed her arm and twisted it behind Nao&#39;s back. Nao freed 
herself a second later with the correct counter, moving in yet again and 
swinging her arm out to backhand. Lapis blocked the second attack and 
stepped in, pushing on Nao&#39;s arm until she was a few inches away. The 
redhead nearly spat in her face, but before she could, the Otome began 
to speak.

&quot;We&#39;ll see how you manage this time, Yuuki. No promises on me being 
gentle.&quot;

&quot;Shame,&quot; Nao hissed.

Nao pushed herself back and attempted to trip kick the other girl, but 
the attack failed. Lapis jumped over it and after landing, she lashed 
out with her arm. Nao batted it away and attempted to counter by 
throwing her. It didn&#39;t work. Lapis stopped herself short and with the 
robe giving her slightly advanced speed and endurance, she was able to 
actually land a punch. Her fist sailed into Nao&#39;s stomach, and the 
redhead exhaled sharply as the wind was knocked from her. Crap.

One minor setback. She scooted back and fell into a fighting stance 
again, waving the Otome forward. &quot;Let&#39;s see what your made of, bitch!&quot;

Next Episode: Nao&#39;s duel with Lapis rages on, and she may find herself 
willing to admit she&#39;s bitten off more than she can chew. In the 
meantime, Shizuru and Mai pay a visit to Fuuka to discuss the latest 
events with Fumi in hopes of discovering more about the HiME and the 
Otome&#39;s possible mimicry. Akane and Haruka follow a lead on the missing 
Yukariko, but may find themselves in a bit of danger as well. Episode 
1.6: &quot;Recklessness,&quot; coming soon. The war&#39;s about to erupt.</pre>
