<p>The  Spinning of Webs</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I’m going to be  pretty busy next week.”
<p>I was currently seated  on the opposite side of my desk in the student council room sifting  through a stack of papers to read and sign, a certain blue haired  biker sitting across from me diligently typing away on my laptop.  Luckily the council didn’t have a meeting today, which meant  Natsuki could stay as long as she wished, or as long as I allowed,  and lord knows I would keep her here with me forever if I could. The  two of us had remained silent for the past ten minutes before I spoke  up, and needless to say, the girl really hadn’t expected it.</p>
<p>Pausing in her typing,  Natsuki looked up at me, “Hmm?”</p>
<p>“The School  Anniversary Celebration is coming up, remember?” I said, laying my  pencil down and propping my chin up on my hand.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah,” she  stated while leaning back in her chair, “What about it?”</p>
<p>“Since it’s the  student council’s responsibility to organize the events, we’ll be  having meetings every afternoon…”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“…So you probably  won’t be able to use my computer next week, is what I’m trying to  say,” I concluded.</p>
<p>“That shouldn’t be  a problem.”</p>
<p>“Good. I just wanted  you to know…and I wanted to apologize in advance for any  inconveniences.”</p>
<p>Natsuki raised an  eyebrow at this, “What are you saying? You don’t have to  apologize for anything, Shizuru. I’m just lucky that you let me use  your computer in the first place. It’s no big deal if I can’t for  a week. That’s nothing to worry about, I’m sure you have enough  stuff to stress over anyway.”</p>
<p>“I guess you’re  right. I’m just glad to be of some help to Natsuki, even if it  isn’t that much.”</p>
<p>“You help me more  than you know,” she replied, turning back to the screen to continue  her work.</p>
<p>I  couldn’t help but smile broadly at her words. She had said them so  casually that I really didn’t know if she was aware of the depth of  them. Or the depth that <em>could </em>be  there. Maybe I was looking into it too much, but even though my brain  argued that it could be nothing, my heart said otherwise.</p>
<p>There was a short pause  afterwards as I reveled in the presence of the girl, watching her,  simply watching her, before I decided to break the silence again,  “So, are you going to attend the festivities?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,”  came the curt reply.</p>
<p>“You should. Maybe we  could walk around and look at the booths together.”</p>
<p>This got Natsuki to  give her attention to me again, along with a slightly baffled  expression, “Huh?”</p>
<p>“What do you say,  hm?”</p>
<p>“Eh…well, I’ve  never really been one for crowds…”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on,  Natsuki…Please?”</p>
<p>“Oi, Shizuru—“</p>
<p>“Please?”</p>
<p>“…Fine.”</p>
<p>“Ookini, Natsuki!”  I exclaimed, a full smile on my face as I tilted my head to the side.</p>
<p>The girl merely huffed  at me.</p>
<p>I continued to smile  sweetly at her as she let out a sigh, “Well, I’m done for today.”</p>
<p>“You’re leaving  already?”</p>
<p>“Already? I’ve been  here for half an hour, Shizuru.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” I  stated, pouting slightly.</p>
<p>Natsuki shook her head  at me, “I really do have some stuff to take care of in town.”</p>
<p>“I see…” I  mumbled, my head drooping momentarily before regaining my composure,  “Be careful then, okay?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” the  girl confidently responded while standing, “I guess I’ll see you  at the festival then?”</p>
<p>“But that’s over a  week away…”</p>
<p>“I thought you just  said you were going to be busy until then.”</p>
<p>“You could still come  visit, you know,” I lightheartedly protested.</p>
<p>Before Natsuki could  say anything, the phone on the edge of my desk suddenly rang making  us both jump slightly. I immediately stood and answered it.</p>
<p>“Student Council  room.”</p>
<p>“<em>Fujino-san? This  is Himeno Fumi. I’m calling on behalf of Rijichou Kazahana whom  requests your presence at the moment if that is possible.”</em></p>
<p>“Yes, that’s fine.  I’ll be right on my way.”</p>
<p>Once I had finished, I  placed the receiver back in its holder, “It seems that I have  somewhere to be as well.”</p>
<p>“Who called?”</p>
<p>“The Director’s  assistant.”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“I’m about to go  find out,” I said as I pulled out my keys and proceeded to wave  them at the biker as I walked towards the door. Natsuki was quick to  follow.</p>
<p>“I’ll walk with  you,” came the voice from behind me as I locked the door.</p>
<p>I turned to the  raven-haired girl with a playfully quizzical expression, “But I  thought Natsuki had someplace to be?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure I can  afford a small detour,” Natsuki replied with a roll of her eyes.</p>
<p>The two of us made  small talk as we made our way out of the building and towards the  director’s residence. Once we had made it to the end of the main  walkway, Natsuki abruptly halted.</p>
<p>“You can manage from  here I assume.”</p>
<p>“What? Natsuki  doesn’t want to say hello to the director?” I teased.</p>
<p>The girl paused for a  moment, almost as if she was contemplating her next words, before  shrugging, “And get a lecture on my slacking attendance record? I  think not.”</p>
<p>“That’s my job,  isn’t it?”</p>
<p>That certainly won me a  glare, “Whatever. Have fun with your little chat.”</p>
<p>I simply shook my head  at Natsuki’s sarcasm as I watched her walk off and back towards the  school, inevitably to go fetch her motorcycle from its secret hiding  spot in the wooded area close to the school. My smile quickly faded,  however, as soon as my friend was out of sight. I turned and began  walking towards the front entrance of the house.</p>
<p><em>What was that just  now, Natsuki? When I mentioned the director…Was it…resentment?  Distrust? Why is that…?</em></p>
<p>I was just about to  knock on the door when it swung open, revealing a cheerful face  amongst pink curls.</p>
<p>“Good afternoon,  Fujino-san,” the woman greeted me along with a bow.</p>
<p>I imitated the gesture,  “Himeno-san, it’s good to see you again.”</p>
<p>Stepping out of the  way, the older maid motioned me inside, “Please, right this way.”</p>
<p>Following her  instruction, I entered and was quick to follow her once she had  closed the door. Ms. Himeno led me to a familiar room. It was large  and spacey, the giant windows running from floor to ceiling along one  of the walls only adding to the openness. There was a small break in  the line of windows where a section of wall was placed to reinforce  the structure, and it was here that an old grandfather clock stood.  In front of it was a table with a single comfy looking chair for  company. The young director currently sat on the opposite side in her  usual wheelchair, turning to us when she heard us enter.</p>
<p>“Fujino-san, I’m  glad you could come. Ah, Fumi-san, could you please prepare some  tea?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mashiro-sama,”  the pink haired woman replied before disappearing to another room.</p>
<p>“Please, have a  seat,” the young girl continued.</p>
<p>Doing so, I smiled,  “You seem well, Kazahana-sama.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have been.  And yourself?”</p>
<p>“Very much so,  although things are beginning to pick up lately.”</p>
<p>“Hm, organizing the  School Anniversary Celebration is a rather  heavy burden, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“At times, yes, but  thankfully I have a very resourceful team to work with.”</p>
<p>“That’s good to  hear.”</p>
<p>“I assume that’s  why you called me here today?”</p>
<p>The violet haired  girl’s visage quickly changed from content to sternly serious,  “Actually, there is something else I would like to address you  about…”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“It has come to my  attention that you have recently awakened, Shizuru-hime.”</p>
<p>A crack in the mask.</p>
<p>It is quickly repaired.</p>
<p>“Whatever do you  mean, Rijichou-san?”</p>
<p>“Nagi…you have  spoke to him, have you not?”</p>
<p><em>That boy? Mmm…she  clearly knows about this…All of it, it seems…There’s no point  in playing dumb now…</em></p>
<p>“…Yes,” I calmly  answered.</p>
<p>“And he has explained  your purpose?”</p>
<p>“Purpose?”</p>
<p>“Orphans…Monsters  that appear from another place into our world…They can only be  destroyed by you HiMEs. That is why you were invited here after your  father’s—“</p>
<p>“I see,” I  interrupted a little harshly before she could continue, “So you  brought me here to kill these <em>Orphans</em>?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Although you  have already done this…recently, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>It was true. About a  week ago I had been on my way home from the market with a few  groceries when the thing had appeared. It chased me into the woods by  the dorms, and it was there that I had summoned my Child and my  element. With Kiyohime by my side the monster hadn’t stood a  chance. She had grown gradually since I had first accepted her and  continued to do so. Why this was, I had no idea, but even so, the  mighty creature obeyed my every command without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I gave the  vague response.</p>
<p>“You are…Kiyohime’s  master, correct?”</p>
<p><em>So she knows about  her as well…This is all very interesting…</em></p>
<p>I simply nodded in  reply, and I was surprised and somewhat confused to see Kazahana-san  sadden the instant I did so.</p>
<p>“I see,” she  practically whispered. After a bout of silence in which the Rijichou  seemed to be in deep thought, she regained the strength in her voice  once again, “You must make the decision for yourself, if you will  fight or not. I will not punish you in any way if you chose not to,  but…you, and the others like you, are the only ones who can fight  the Orphans. I ask that you please consider that when you do decide.”</p>
<p>I didn’t stay for the  tea.</p>
<p>After Kazahana-sama and  I had exchanged eerily pleasant goodbyes, I left the mansion with all  haste, without making it appear that way, of course. On my way back  to the student council room, my mind replayed the previous  conversation in my head several times.</p>
<p><em>She said there  really are others like me…other HiMEs…Thinking back, Nagi said  the same when I first met him, right? And…why did she look  so…troubled…when I told her Kiyohime was my Child… </em></p>
<p>Entering the room, I  merely collected my things and left yet again, knowing that I  wouldn’t be able to concentrate on anything after what had just  taken place.</p>
<p><em>So she wants me to fight these monsters…I’m sorry,  Rijichou-san, but I have only one purpose…one reason to use these  powers bestowed upon me…And </em><em><strong>she</strong></em><em> is the only  one I will fight for.</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The smell of stale  stagnant air hit me like a punch to the face. It was a combination of  alcohol, vomit, and sweat, made any first timer sick to their  stomach, and it attacked my senses as soon as I maneuvered my Ducati  through the thin alleyways of downtown Tsukimori.  The area was like a maze, but by now I easily knew my way around. I  came to a stop under a round neon sign, it’s purple light showing  the location of the Rorschach bar, my current destination. Shutting  off the engine, I swung my leg over the body of my bike before  descending down the small flight of stairs and opening the door at  their end. As soon as I entered, helmet nestled under my arm, the  constant murmur of the customers inside dulled to a purr. There was a  wolf whistle here and there, but it wasn’t anything I wasn’t used  to ignoring.
<p>Spotting my target, I  made my way over to the bar. Yamada always sat on that same stool  whenever he was at the counter. He always got the same drink too.  Placing my helmet on the wooden surface as I sat down, I immediately  dug into the inside pocket of my jacket, removed a small white  envelope, and slid it over to him. The man casually reached out and  took the money, securing it in his vest as we both continued to look  straight ahead. I was the first to break the ice.</p>
<p>“Any information?”</p>
<p>“I discovered an  abandoned research facility.”</p>
<p>“…Where?”</p>
<p>“Near Fukanuma  beach…”</p>
<p><em>That place?! It’s—!</em></p>
<p>“…about forty miles  from…”</p>
<p>…<em>Mother…</em></p>
<p>“Hey, Kuga, are you  even listening?”</p>
<p>I set my inner turmoil  on pause.</p>
<p>“Fukanuma beach.  Forty miles. I got it.”</p>
<p>At that, I stood and  made to leave.</p>
<p>“H-hey…”</p>
<p>“Keep looking,  Yamada. I’ll go check this place out when I get the chance.”</p>
<p>“Right,” my  informant nodded before turning back to his drink.</p>
<p>I exited the room the  same way I had come, being welcomed by artificial light as I made my  way back up to the surface. Walking over to my bike, I mounted it  with a sigh.</p>
<p>“I guess I’ll have  to go there at least once,” I muttered to myself as I pulled my  hair back in preparation to place my helmet on.</p>
<p>I was so involved in my  own little world that I didn’t even notice the familiar redhead run  by until she stopped herself right beside me.</p>
<p>“Eh?!”</p>
<p>“You’re—“</p>
<p>“Kuga-san? You  haven’t happened to see Mikoto, have you?” Mai hastily  interrogated me.</p>
<p>“N-no…Why? Did you  lose her or something?” I questioned back but with a twinge of  sarcasm.</p>
<p>“She’s been missing  since this afternoon. Nagi said that something bad was happening  and—“</p>
<p>“Nagi?!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, he said that  Mikoto and some other girl were in danger here in Tsukimori, but I  haven’t been able to find them at all. I don’t know where to  start.”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright,  calm down,” I insisted followed by an agitated sigh, “Wait here a  minute, I’ll see if anyone downstairs has heard anything.”</p>
<p>Dismounting from my  motorcycle once again, I headed back down to the bar, but rather than  venture inside, I merely stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>“Has anyone heard  about or seen a dark haired middle school girl around this area?” I  asked the crowd, raising my voice so all of those inside could hear.</p>
<p>I was honestly  uncomfortable with all those eyes on me, especially the ones that  lingered on certain areas of my body, but that couldn’t be bothered  with at the moment. Eventually a voice spoke up from the back. Of  course, he had to look like a potential pedophile…</p>
<p>“I’ve seen a middle  school girl hanging around these parts for a while now. Always with a  new guy, the little whore…”</p>
<p>“Do you know any  specifics on a location?”</p>
<p>“Word has it she  likes to take ‘em where they’re working on that new office  building.”</p>
<p>“Behind the Violet  Crown?”</p>
<p>“That’s the place.”</p>
<p>“I see…Thanks,” I  said with a nod.</p>
<p>“No problem,” the  man replied with a wink.</p>
<p>I held in my snarl  until I had turned around and was halfway up the stairs. Once I had  reemerged from the darkness below, Mai nearly knocked me back down  into it.</p>
<p>“Did you hear  anything?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, rumor has it  they might be nearby—“</p>
<p>“Where? Can you take  me there? We have to hurry, Mikoto could be…”</p>
<p>“Just follow me,” I  snapped before taking off at a sprint towards the main road.</p>
<p>Mai was right behind me  as we ran down the sidewalk, weaving around the crowds of people who  littered the street. We turned quite a few heads and earned a couple  of not-so-nice comments, but I kept my focus on locating the right  building. When I finally spotted the sign, I skidded around the  corner and proceeded to creep towards the next, my back against the  cool cement wall.</p>
<p>“She’s really at a  place like this?” Mai quietly questioned, peering around me to get  a look.</p>
<p>“What the guys from  the bar say is usually true.”</p>
<p>“But what were you  doing in a place like that?”</p>
<p>“You don’t need  to—”</p>
<p><em>Footsteps.</em></p>
<p>I stopped in time to  see a teenage boy who appeared to be in a fast food uniform walk past  us, and freeze when a voice sounded from nearby. From our current  position, Mai and I watched in secrecy.</p>
<p align="center">“<em>Hey…I’m  really bored right now. So, you want to play with me a little?”</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>You  a junior high student?”</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>Yes.”</em></p>
<p>A mischievous leer was  emitted from the male before he followed the young HiME down another  alley, and out of our sight. I turned to the redhead beside me who  was wholeheartedly dumbfounded by the event that had just occurred.  She stood silent for a brief moment before exploding.</p>
<p>“Wha-wha-what is  Mikoto doing?!” she screamed, grabbing me by the shoulders and  violent shaking me back and fourth.</p>
<p>I tried to pry her  hands off of me, but she had a better grip than I thought, “What?  Well…”</p>
<p>And then another set of  footsteps was heard. Lighter this time, they effectively got both of  our attentions. Leaning around the corner again, I was surprised to  see another girl in a middle school uniform cautiously follow the  pair that had just gone down the same alleyway. I was distracted,  however, when a hand made contact with the top of my head and  forcefully pushed me down out of the way.</p>
<p>“She’s!”</p>
<p>“Get off of me…”  I grumbled at Mai, and she did, but I doubt it was because I had said  so.</p>
<p>“But that girl! She’s  Aoi’s roommate…I think her name is Nao. She and Mikoto had been  talking lately, but…Mikoto would never do something like this. I  bet that girl’s making her do it! Aoi did say she wasn’t the best  person to be around…”</p>
<p>“Even  if that’s the case, Mikoto still had to go along with it. It’s  called <em>free will</em>.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but—!”</p>
<p>“How about we just go  find out for ourselves,” I remarked more like a statement than a  question.</p>
<p>Finally, Mai collected  herself and nodded her agreement.</p>
<p>Luckily  we made it in time before anything serious happened, but I was  shocked to see the claw weapon on this <em>Nao’s</em> hands.</p>
<p><em>So she’s a HiME as  well…</em></p>
<p>“That’s enough!”  I yelled out as we entered the construction area before turning to  the boy who was currently shaking at the red-haired HiME’s feet.  “You there, I’ll let you escape just this once. Don’t ever do  anything like this again.”</p>
<p>The pervert let out a  scream as he fled. I followed him with my eyes to make sure he didn’t  stick around, but somehow I didn’t think that was going to be a  problem.</p>
<p>“Mai…” I heard  Mikoto whisper, and I turned my gaze back to the girls before me.</p>
<p>“Why do you do this?  Such foolish things?” Mai questioned in a tone harsher than I had  heard the girl sound since I’d been around her.</p>
<p>It  was followed by a mocking laugh, “Mikoto told me about you two…You  two are HiMEs as well, right? Then don’t you understand? What’s  wrong with using my power the way I want to? That kid-director said  it herself, <em>‘decide what to do on  your own’</em>.”</p>
<p>The red haired girl  paused for a moment before she continued her rant, switching back  over to the original subject, “She was pissed about you treating  her like a child, so I taught her a lesson. The use of the power we  have.”</p>
<p>“Mikoto…” Mai  muttered.</p>
<p>The golden-eyed HiME  averted her gaze as Nao spoke up again.</p>
<p>“Plus,  I hate people like you. Acting like, <em>‘I’m  innocent, I’m a good sister, I’m having lots of trouble…’</em>I’ve heard so much of that that  I’m getting calluses in my ears from listening. <em>‘Mai-chan  is so great at working hard.’</em> You  retarded or what? Makes me want to puke.”</p>
<p>“Mai…” Mikoto  barely uttered again at the sight of her now teary eyed friend.</p>
<p>Certainly, the girl’s  words were harsh. They were as sharp as the blades on those claws of  hers, but I honestly have to say that I did see the truth behind  them…and deep down, I agreed with her. But still…</p>
<p>This time it was my  turn to laugh, “True, you do have a point. The First  District…There’s no reason for us to follow their orders, and  it’s entirely up to the individual how they use their powers…”</p>
<p>The green-eyed girl  smirked, “You know the deal.”</p>
<p>“Therefore,” I  continued, materializing my element and turning it on the girl, “it’s  my right to not like your idea as well. Right?”</p>
<p>I stared at her with a  smug grin on my face as she licked her element and extended the  crimson claws even further, “I knew it.”</p>
<p>“Wait! Hold on, you  two,” Mai pleaded, “Yeah?”</p>
<p>Nao merely waved her  fingers at me, enticing me to come at her, “You want to try dying  first?”</p>
<p>“Nao,” Mikoto piped  in.</p>
<p>And then the comedian  showed up…</p>
<p>“Hold it, hold it,  hold it, hold it.”</p>
<p>A very <em>drunk</em> comedian…</p>
<p>“Hold it right  there,” Midori exclaimed, gripping my shoulder and using it to  propel herself forward. I jerked back from the motion.</p>
<p>The woman stammered for  a bit, nearly falling down on her intoxicated ass before  straightening in posture, “Stop fighting. <em>Hic.</em>”</p>
<p>“Midori-chan?” Mai  questioned in concern.</p>
<p>“Stop it, or else…”  our <em>sensei</em> warned, sobering up enough to summon her element  before returning to her drunken stupor, “I’ll punish all of you  at once.”</p>
<p>She tried to swing her  bardiche, but ended up just incapacitating herself instead.</p>
<p><em>She really is an  embarrassment…How is it that they let her teach at our school?</em></p>
<p>“Who is she?” Nao  asked.</p>
<p>Somehow, the woman in  question was back on her feet, grabbing the girl by the shoulders, as  she managed to lecture even in her current state, “You crazy dunce.  You’ve got to take better care of yourself—Ergh! I feel sick…”</p>
<p>The oh-so-lovely sound  of someone puking their guts out.</p>
<p>A disgusted scream.</p>
<p>And an annoyed sigh  amongst the ruckus, but that one surely wasn’t heard.</p>
<p>Mai was quick to grab  Midori and drag her over to the side, a trail of orange liquid  showing where she previously stood. Nao was sitting on the floor from  where she had stumbled backwards when the spewing had begun, Mikoto  standing nearby having not moved since we arrived. I remained where I  was, massaging my temples at the whole thing.</p>
<p><em>Honestly, why do I  always—!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, Nagi dropped  down from the sky right in the middle of our little powwow, “That’s  enough.”</p>
<p>“Nagi!” I said in  shock.</p>
<p>“You…” Nao  mumbled.</p>
<p>The boy walked in front  of the red-haired HiME, “I’m not here to comment on what Nao  does. It is up to you guys how you use your powers. But…no fighting  amongst HiMEs.”</p>
<p>Nao was quick to bite  back, “Why not? Those guys are…”</p>
<p>“If you cause too  much trouble, I’ll punish you, Nao-chan, “ the boy countered in  complete seriousness, and the girl visibly shuddered at his words.</p>
<p>“Besides,” Midori  interrupted, seemingly recovered enough to rant again as she wrapped  her arm around Mai’s shoulders, “you’re bound to regret what  you do when you realize who it is that you really love.”</p>
<p>Surprisingly enough,  Nagi agreed with an amused smile, “Well said, Midori-chan!”</p>
<p>“What would you  know?” Nao screamed, her red claws turning into strings that  wrapped around the overhead beams. “All of you deserve to be  squashed.”</p>
<p>And then she was gone.  Nagi was quick to follow, and as the ceiling began to crumble, panic  set in.</p>
<p>“Let’s get out of  here, we’ll get crushed,” I announced, turning to Mai to make  sure she had our stupid professor with her.</p>
<p>“Mikoto!” the  redhead cried out.</p>
<p>The younger girl  remained stationary, and Mai instinctively reached out for her, “What  are you doing? Hurry up!”</p>
<p>Metal beams fell around  us, blocking the path between the three of us and the dark haired  HiME.</p>
<p>“Mikoto!” Mai  desperately tired again, but the girl still didn’t move.</p>
<p>More and more of the  building continued to crumble. Mai screamed out again, and forcefully  grabbing her by the waist, I somehow managed to pull all three of us  out of the way before more heavy debris landed on top of us.</p>
<p>After our rough  landing, it took a little effort to pull myself up again, and turning  back, I only saw a pile of steaming rubble where the half-finished  building just stood.</p>
<p>“Mikoto…MIKOTO!”  Mai wailed, the sounds of her cries completely heartbreaking.  “No!  Mikoto! Eh?!”</p>
<p>Getting to my feet, I  couldn’t take my eyes off of the sight before me.</p>
<p>At the top of the  smoldering pile, a figure emerged.</p>
<p>“That’s…”</p>
<p>“Reito-san?” Mai  stated in bewilderment when the male came into the light, Mikoto in  his arms.</p>
<p>“Kanzaki…”</p>
<p><em>But…how…?</em></p>
<p>I silently watched on  as the student council vice president carefully maneuvered his way  down the mountain of wreckage, and once he was safely on the  pavement, away from the now collapsed building, Mai was immediately  by his and Mikoto’s side as he lowered the unconscious girl to the  ground.</p>
<p>The two were exchanging  words, but I was far too preoccupied to listen.</p>
<p><em>Where did he come  from? And how did he get Mikoto out of that death trap? She was…done  for…</em></p>
<p>I glanced over at the  slightly older boy, squinting my eyes at him.</p>
<p><em>I don’t like this  at all.</em></p>
<p>I was relieved when the  girl awoke a few minutes later. It didn’t seem like she had been  injured at all during the mess. Maybe that was partly thanks to her  HiME powers, but Reito had certainly played a big part in her being  here with us right now. Poor Mai looked both physically and  emotionally exhausted from the whole ordeal. Watching her worry over  her friend like that, it made me wonder if I put Shizuru through the  same thing. Granted the older girl had no idea of what I really did  and the dangers I put myself though, but still, I knew she could tell  whenever I had been injured or was tired. She wouldn’t always  verbalize her concern or what she saw, but I knew that she was well  aware. You could just tell by the look she always got in her eyes.</p>
<p>I decided to keep my  distance from Mai, Mikoto, and the whole scene, not wanting to get  involved, especially when the police showed up. A few minutes later,  I was just about to slip away when Mai caught me by the arm.</p>
<p>“Kuga-san, wait!”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Um…thank you. If  you hadn’t pulled us out, Midori and I might have been crushed…and  without your help, I might not have found Mikoto in the first place.”</p>
<p>I shook my head, “Don’t  worry about. Just keep an eye on her from now on.”</p>
<p>The girl smiled with  tired eyes, “Right.”</p>
<p>Snaking my way through the crowd of bystanders that had accumulated,  I eventually made it back to my bike, hastily pulled on my helmet,  and drove off towards home.</p>
