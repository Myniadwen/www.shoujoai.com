<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Why  give up?</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Till the  End</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Looking  back, Natsuki should have seen it coming. Yes, the black-clad  soldiers had saved them, but what had they saved them from?  Black-clad soldiers.  It hadn’t been an act perpetrated by a single  group, since the fighting had been very, very real—Natsuki herself  had killed a pair of them—but their means had been similar; why  shouldn’t their motives be as well?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  piece of introspection came to her remarkably easily as she opened  her eyes, allowing her head a moment to adjust to the sudden,  unexpected change of scenery.  The bizarre, momentarily inexplicable  change in décor: From the back of a black van that smelled  mildly of tobacco and gunpowder, trying desperately not to get in the  way of the combat helicopter that had started to strafe their convoy  about two minutes after they’d been loaded away; to the near-black  room, made of what the back of her skull, pressed up against it, told  her was very cheap concrete or stone, which smelled vaguely of urine  and turpentine. Her head was still foggy, probably from whatever it  was that had caused this odd lapse in her internal clock, and  probably the external one as well, so for the moment, she felt fairly  content to lay there, pondering the merits of a hard, piss-stained  floor as a pillow.  Maybe she would have, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  sat bolt upright for reasons she would only be able to explain much  later, a searing pain tearing through her stomach and up her torso.  It seemed to stop moving at her breastbone, and for one tense moment,  she thought she would be spending the duration of her prison stay in  rapidly mounting agony. A second later, her gorge rose, and she bent  over and let her stomach empty onto the piss-stained floor that had  served so faithfully for so short a time as her pillow. Her vomit was  a ripe green, something she hadn’t really seen in vomit before, and  smelled strongly of the same turpentine she was quite certain she  smelled out of the room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She put  a hand to her stomach, which settled almost as soon as it was empty,  and stayed in that position for a few seconds, tiny droplets of  stomach acid hanging from her flushed lips, her whole body tingling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It took  her a few seconds to realize that her hand, clutched to her stomach,  was warmer than her other hand, still holding her up off the stone  floor.  She pondered this abnormality for a moment, and then, with  more effort than she’d have expected, sat up on her calves and took  her hand away from her stomach.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It came  away red, and not just a little. Blood dripped from her palm, full to  the brim, seeping between her fingers and off of the sides.  Startled, she looked down, found a rapidly-spreading stain on the  left side of her shirt, plastering the thin fabric to her flesh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For a  minute, she found she could only stare at it, watching it spread in  an oddly symmetrical fashion. <em>Shouldn’t the bottom be  progressing faster than the top? Is that just the myth of gravity? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No,  wait.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shook her head once, and then again, found it did her no good.  She  knew what it was she had to do, she just couldn’t come up with it.  It was like her head was filled with lead and she couldn’t seem to  get past it, no matter how hard she blinked, no matter how many times  she shook it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Was I  drugged?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Or  have I just lost more blood than I thought?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>How  long have I been out?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  wasn’t sure. The answer was, again, just underneath the layer of  lead that had made its way into her skull. Just like all the other  answers.  She could get to them, but the digging was just too much.  Best to send a canary in first, make sure there’s not some kind of  gas still sitting<br />
      <em>Gas.<br />
        Fucking<br />
        Gas.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What  that meant, she wasn’t sure.  She knew it was important. Damn  important. <em>Did they gas me? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  seemed likely.  After all, she couldn’t trust them. Not at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somehow,  her mistrust and the validations of her inherent paranoia seemed to  bring her enough motivation not to let herself bleed out all over the  stone floor. Slipping out of her shirt, she ripped a shred off of  it—it came off surprisingly easy, which meant she’d probably been  ripped off when she bought it—while she looked at her cut more  intently—it was fairly large, but surprisingly clean.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Where  the hell would I have gotten something like this? Shouldn’t it be  nastier if it came from a fight? It almost looks like I was cut with  a scalpel.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Refusing  to think on it more for the moment, with her brainpower so limited  already, Natsuki tied the mostly-rectangular strip around her  ribcage, making sure to apply as much pressure as she could to the  cut area, which was already starting to clot a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Probably  it had been mostly clotted when I woke up, and moving around like a  dumbass ripped it open again. </em>Hopefully the shirt would help it  heal better, stop her from unconsciously being a bad patient again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That’s  what he used to call her when she showed up torn and bloody—a bad  patient.  He wasn’t even a doctor, he’d just splash on some  hydrogen peroxide (<em>Double-H Double-O, he called it</em>) and then  bandage her up and leave her laying on his couch, naked as the day  she was born if it was really bad, and when she woke up he’d be  gone, and she’d leave until she needed somebody to splash on some  double-HO and bandage her up again when she couldn’t do it herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  considered leaving what was left of her shirt where it lay, decided  against it.  Her recent months <em>sans </em>violence had verily  exponentiated her modesty, and she couldn’t quite bring herself  back to where she’d been before, not on a whim anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She had  just finished donning her shirt when somebody said, “You know, we  do have bandages.  Had we known you were going to make such a mess of  yourself, we’d have kept them on you longer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Lead-head  it is. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  lifted her lead-head as quickly as she could, taking great care not  to disturb the equilibrium within that she suspected was preventing  her from a debilitating headache. Standing outside of her cell was a  tall, casually-dressed man whose fingers, one set cupping his elbow  while the other stroked several days worth of stubble on his chin,  were far too long and far too thin for his not-unimpressive gut.  He  had a thin mess of hair, like a toupee but fairly obviously attached  to his skull, covering his baldness, and it seemed to Natsuki  strangely reminiscent of a man wearing a leaf to cover his privates.  She snickered at the thought, unable to control herself. <em>Do I  have a concussion? </em>The answer seemed increasingly to be yes,  though she thought that if she did, her brain ought to be kicking at  her skull about now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If it  bothered the man, he didn’t show it.  Only smiled at her.  “You  heal remarkably quickly, Miss Kuga.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>How  does he know my name?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Oh,  right. He’s got me locked up. He knows whatever the hell he wants  to.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Though  I daresay you’re rather lucky to be alive, in spite of this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Some  good it does me,” she said, her words coming out slurred into,  “<em>shome gooit uzz ee.</em>” She blinked, and then touched the  left side of her face, finding the sensation dulled considerably.  For a single terrified, horrible moment she feared that maybe she’d  suffered some sort of brain damage when they did…whatever they did,  but a second later, the man said, “If you’re having trouble  feeling that half of your face, don’t worry about it.  It’s  probably just a side-effect of the anesthetic we gave you. Now…”  he almost seemed as though he was enjoying himself, “what precisely  did you say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  grimaced, screwed her face up in focus.  “I shed,” she said as  clearly as she could, “<em>shome guud it tus me.</em> You sheem to  have me locked up nishly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man  blinked twice, absorbing it as best he could, and then laughed of a  sudden.  “Locked up?” he said, chuckling to himself.  “Have you  tested the door to your cell yet? I suppose not. You only just woke  up, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  frowned.  She wanted to stand up, whether to test the door or to  punch the man, she wasn’t certain. “What…” she gathered  herself as best she could, wanting to sound threatening but willing  to settle for not sounding pathetic. “What…am I doing here…if  I’m not locked up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wonder,” the man smiled—that was to say, his lips curved  upwards—and Natsuki decided at once that it wasn’t any kind of  smile at all. “It wasn’t me who put you here, after all. I’m  here to retrieve you, in fact. I’m afraid the captain insisted on  detaining you until you’d been checked out as…how did he put it?”  The man paused, and scratched at his face again.  “Calmed.”<br />
      <em>liar  liar pants on fire</em><br />
  Strangely,  this was not the first time this thought had occurred to Natsuki that  day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Faut  you shed I wash shedated,” Natsuki murmured, her eyes narrowing.  The man wasn’t lying, per se—or if he was, he was good enough at  it that worrying on it further would serve no purpose—but he was  plainly not being friendly with her, which, when she considered his  pleasant demeanor, was a lie unto itself, and therefore something to  pay very, very close attention to. As she thought this, she felt her  adrenaline pick up, and her head cleared a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  captain found your actions on the Goza beach impressive enough that  he wished to take no chances. I sincerely apologize for your present  conditions.” At this, he actually<em> bowed,</em> though it, like his  smile, was not truly a bow—the look on his face for a moment was  too ugly. Too bitter.“If you’d like to come with me, I’m  quite certain we can give you something for your pain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To her  surprise, Natsuki found that there wasn’t much.  That didn’t mean  that she could stand—she moved into a squatting position, but found  her legs to be not much more use than jelly—but as her head cleared  of whatever had mucked it up (ironically, also a bit like jelly) no  thudding, eye-bursting pain seemed to step in to fill the gap.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah,  still having trouble walking.” His back straight again, his face  seemed to simply melt back into its previous smile, and after a  moment, that burning<br />
      <em>hatred</em><br />
  ugliness  was simply gone again.  “I’ll have somebody bring you a  wheelchair at once.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The idea  immediately repelled Natsuki, who didn’t like the idea of being  stuck with her back to somebody she barely knew, but she figured it  couldn’t be <em>too </em>long before she was up and about again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  though possessed with a dour sort of ESP, the man said almost  immediately, “If you can’t walk now, I wouldn’t expect to be  able to for at least a day or two,” he said.  “We had to make an  incision into your leg when we got to you, to remove a piece of  shrapnel before it cut into your femoral artery.  In the process we  had to move some muscle aside, and I’m afraid we may have done some  damage, due to the urgency of the whole thing. I’m afraid field  surgeons are never the gentlest of hands in any case, but they saved  your life, so I’m sure you’ll forgive them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  grimaced. <em>I can’t wheel myself, either. Not with this gash on  my side. </em>“What happened here?” she asked, her words a little  less muddled, clutching her bloody, bare side.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  similar fate, I’m afraid,” the man said solemnly, only he wasn’t  really solemn at all.  “I can tell you, if you’d like, or I can  save the tale for a time when you’re feeling more yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ish  it long?” Natsuki managed to prop herself up so that her torso was  straight, at least.  It took some doing, between her half-numb ass  and a pair of arms which she was hesitant to move more than a few  centimeters in either directions, but she did it nonetheless. <em>She </em>was impressed, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  gory detail? Yes.” The man scratched his chin again. “A  military-style report is rarely brief and hardly ever fascinating  enough to guarantee your consciousness all the way through, drugs or  no.  If you’d like, I can give you the condensed version  while…excuse me.” He paused, and Natsuki heard a phone buzzing  quietly from somewhere on his person. He dug into the pockets of his  slacks, extracted a small cellular phone, and flipped it open, raised  it to his ear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”  he said curtly, turning away but not dropping his voice.  “Yes,  there was blood.  I should have your head, but I think I’ll settle  with your fee for now. Yes, and bring a wheelchair.” At this, he  shut the phone and turned back to Natsuki, and again she caught the  last vestiges of The Ugly fleeing from his face. “Please excuse  me,” he said. “I do have a great deal of business these days.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  frowned.  “Who are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  am <em>I</em>?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You.  Them. All of this.” Her mouth was getting better by the minute, and  Natsuki was beginning to suspect that maybe the numbness had had more  to do with the way she’d been laying than any sort of drugs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  that makes sense, doesn’t it?  In a twisted sort of way, it does.  If their anesthetics dulled me that badly, I probably wouldn’t be  half as coherent as I am.  Adrenaline can’t push off a really tough  dose of tranquilizer, and I’m obviously on some sort of juice,  since there’s a giant gash in my side and another one in my leg  that I can’t feel.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Thinking  about it like this made Natsuki feel good in an odd sort of way.  It  was almost nostalgic—the way her mind seemed to slide out of her  body as she thought about her situation objectively, judged her  surroundings.  It provided her with a calmness she could never find  anywhere else. It was something she hadn’t felt in quite a long  time—that feeling of coolness, of readiness in spite of the drugs.  It was one of the things, though she never really thought on it, that  made her such a dangerous person.  A dangerous <em>warrior. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  can’t tell you much,” the man said. “Mercenaries are  notoriously taciturn about their private affairs, but I can tell you  that you are currently under the protection and employ of the Third  Swiss Remnants, a fully-supported regiment of mercenaries of the very  finest caliber. You are sitting in a cell in an abandoned prison not  awfully far away from where the van was—forgive me,” he paused,  shaking his head at himself.  This annoyed Natsuki—on another man,  maybe it would have been charming, but this man was bookish, and  although he was well-spoken, he came off as just slightly<br />
      <em>insane</em><br />
  off-color,  which ruined the effect he was going for.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  tell you the story of the van in a bit.  In any event, you are not  far from Goza, though I’m sure you understand that we have enemies  that you are not to leak that information to.” He gave her a  secretive sort of wink, something that she was sure was supposed to  represent camaraderie, but was, as with so many things about him,  hopelessly out of place.  “And I…” he shrugged, and this seemed  to suit him better.  “I’m an accountant.” He smiled at her.  “But in times of crisis,”<br />
      <em>liar  liar pants on fire</em><br />
  “we  all must rise above our station, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Crisis…?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something <em>dinged </em>out of Natsuki’s view, and the man looked towards it,  scratched his beard again.  Another thing that seemed to suit him—it  was probably a nervous habit, Natsuki decided.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>People  display nervous habits when they lie.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  kept that in mind, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah,”  he said.  “Pardon me. It would seem that I have a bit of business  to attend to before getting your wheelchair.  My apologies.” He  started walking, and Natsuki noticed his gait to be long and  awkward—he probably wasn’t lying about being an accountant,  either, she decided.  But he <em>was </em>lying, of that she was  certain.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Even  so…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Was  it possible that what he’d alluded to was true?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If she  looked back at it very hard, she could remember some of it; how  they’d ridden in the van, a few of them—Midori, mostly, along  with Minoru and Natsuki herself, kicking ideas around about what  precisely was going on, though it seemed that Shizuru was holding  back on something. As though she knew precisely what the answer was  to that all-important question that they were kicking around, and she  simply had not been questioned about it properly.  They really  couldn’t come up with anything, though—many of them had become  well-versed with fighting—too well-versed—but none of them had  experience with this sort of thing—military affairs.  Escalation.  That was a word Minoru had thrown in there a lot. <em>Escalation. </em>It  made a queer sort of sense to Natsuki, though she wasn’t quite sure  how yet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then  there was Mai.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  simply sat there, holding Mikoto close to her on one side, and  holding Yuuichi close on the other. Mikoto had clung to her with a  strange look on her face—something a bit like determination.  Yuuichi had tried to hold <em>her, </em>but Mai would have none of it.  She had whispered something into his ear when he tried to put up a  snit about it, and about midway through, his eyes had sort of…sparked  out, like a lightbulb switched off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That’s  not right.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Like  a lightbulb after it’s been hit with a baseball bat.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  had started to say something back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before  he could finish, the world had decided to quit around them. First  tentatively—the van had rocked, and hard, sending them all into  other people’s places—places they didn’t necessarily have any  business being—but before anybody could get embarrassed about them,  the van had jerked again, and then the world had torn itself apart  around them.  Natsuki remembered being flung out of her seat, her  mind locked up in numbing panic, and then a sharp pain and<br />
      <em>men  with guns</em><br />
  It  had happened to her a few times before—being suddenly and  unexpectedly deprived of her consciousness.  The most recent case was  when Miyu—that bloody blue-haired robot, probably the most  frightening thing Natsuki had ever seen, HiME carnival or no, because <em>nobody </em>should be able to move that god damned fast—had  dropped behind her in a strange, stone room underneath Fuuka Academy,  zapped her with something<br />
  <em>on my  neck</em><br />
  her hand  moved faster than it should have been able to in her condition, but  slower than she could have moved were she in better shape.  She  practically slapped at the back of her neck, then came back, more  slowly, and felt around, searching to see if the area was tender or  extra-sensitive.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  wasn’t. After another second, she was able to breathe again.  She  gently touched her leg, found it relatively numb.  He wasn’t lying  about that, either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He was  lying, though, and Natsuki got the feeling that whatever he was lying  about, she had better catch on, but quick, or she was going to run  the risk of getting into whatever it was she was getting into  completely unprepared.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Because  she <em>was </em>getting into something.  Maybe if she’d known what,  things wouldn’t have gone in the chaotic direction they did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or maybe  they would have.  She did not, after all, have her gun anymore, and  it would be guns that she would need, and soon. She knew this on some  level.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  didn’t make her happy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  wanted him to come back.  The man who was lying about something. She  wanted him to come back and tell her what happened to the rest of her  friends.  Had they even survived?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  if they’re—<br />
  What  if </em>she <em>is…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Impossible.  Her mind rejected it offhand. These people couldn’t kill Shizuru.  She was too strong, and sometimes, she was too<br />
      <em>insane</em><br />
  focused.  Before they got close…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If  they got close, Natsuki felt as though Shizuru might resurrect the  HiME star, gift it with all of its immense energy, singlehandedly,  just to see them all dead in front of her. <em>Especially </em>after  what Natsuki had done back at the camp, just before they’d all  left. <em>Especially </em>after that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Especially  after…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“What  was that?” Shizuru’s voice was hoarse when Natsuki pulled away  from the kiss.  “What was that, Natsuki? Tell me what that was.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“That  was…” Natsuki didn’t know how to say it. Natsuki didn’t know  what it was she didn’t know how to say.  “That was…” she let  a breath out.  “That was me asking you not to leave. To stick it  out with us, to keep going.  Until the end, one way or another.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“To  stick with us?” Shizuru didn’t say it as though it was a  question.  Probably it wasn’t.  It was a sort of cool, if  overly-assuming, confidence that she had—before, it had scared  Natsuki. Before, when she’d tried to kill everybody. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No,  that was a lie. It scared her now, too.  Scared her so very, very  much. Natsuki was a warrior, a fighter with the talents of a trained  soldier, but independence and creativity to match it, and Natsuki was  not often scared. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  Shizuru…Shizuru scared her.  The cold</em><br />
  predatory<br />
  <em>focus  in her eyes sometimes. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One  time in particular.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  even so, she’d kissed her. And Natsuki thought she might just do it  again, at that. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“To  stick with </em>me,” <em>Natsuki admitted. “I need you here, now.  Mai is nearly…useless because of what happened, so I think you’re  the only one I can count on if things turn ugly.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Shizuru  smiled.  Natsuki was lying a little, and both of them knew it.</em><br />
  liar  liar pants on fire<br />
  <em>Shizuru  smiled, and slid her arms around Natsuki’s waist.  “I’ll help  you, Natsuki,” she said, the truth flooding out of her voice.  “I’ll help you, if you’ll kiss me again.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It  should have sounded sick. </em>I’ll help you save the lives of  these people if you’ll give me a kiss. <em>Oddly enough, though, it  didn’t.  It sounded almost … natural to Natsuki.  Maybe it was  something she’d expect from Shizuru. Maybe it was just something  she expected at the moment. After all, where was she? Behind a cabin,  her arms still around the pale, smooth, bare waist of this girl…</em><br />
  this  beautiful girl who<br />
  <em>her  lips still a little moist from the lips of this girl who…</em><br />
  entrances  you so and<br />
  <em>was  pressing herself up against her waist, and a little more than that,  against someplace just a little bit lower; this girl who</em><br />
  scares  you just a little<br />
  <em>loved  her so much that it was</em><br />
  horrifying<br />
  <em>astounding.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So  why not?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Why  not indeed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She  kissed Shizuru again, bringing her closer this time, wrapping her  hands tight about her waist.  It was different this time than it had  been before. Than it had been all those times before.  Those times,  it had almost been like a first kiss, every time. This time it was  different—this time there was something more to the way Shizuru  gripped Natsuki’s shirt in back; the way her hand roamed around the  back of her waist.  This time there was a </em>hunger <em>to it that  half of Natsuki’s body immediately rebelled against, and half of  it, most notably something far lower than her heart, embraced. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>They  broke it eventually, and Shizuru smiled at Natsuki.  It was a lover’s  smile, yes, but there was something more to it.</em><br />
  i  told you so<br />
  liar  liar pants on fire<br />
  <em>“I’ll  help you,” Shizuru said.  “I would have no matter what, Natsuki,  but since you put it so concisely, we’ll do it your way.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  way indeed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Had her  way gotten them all killed? Were they all dead because of <em>her way?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What  was the alternative, though? To let Shizuru just walk into the arms  of…whoever? The gaping black maw of soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somehow,  Natsuki thought that wouldn’t be enough to satiate it.  Not  thought. <em> Knew. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But even  so.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Did that  mean that they were all dead because of nobody in particular?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>They  can’t all be dead. </em>Back where she started. Simply because  Shizuru would not allow it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  could only put her faith in that.  What little she had.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She laid  back down. After putting her faith in that, she could only wait.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Waiting  was always the hardest part.</span></p>

“Buy  my contract, huh?” Minoru said, frowning up at the tall, fattish  man who claimed to be an accountant. “I’ve gotten that offer once  before. What makes you think I’m going to take you up on it this  time?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man  smiled.  “I can double your going rate for this contract, Mister  Alder; I’ve said that already. I would think that this number  alone—and it is a sizable number, as I’m sure you  understand—should settle the matter for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Money’s  no good if you’re too busy decomposing to spend it,” Minoru said.  “Whatever’s going on around here—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  afraid I really can’t give you any details,” the man interrupted,  and Minoru grinned inwardly. <em>Bingo.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Didn’t  ask for them. What I was gonna say was that whatever’s going on  around here is pretty nasty.  I have a hard time believing you even <em>found </em>a Merc regiment to hire, let alone were able to afford  them, no matter how much you claim to be able to pay me. Nasty  situations rarely have such a neat, tidy ending.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,”  the man smiled, “the Sino-Russian conflict does seem to have taken  a rather bloody turn in the past months.  I think you’ll find that  mercenary regiments are popping up out of retirement all over the  place.  It’s a good time to be a hired gun, if I do say so myself.  I wouldn’t dream of sullying my ranking with the mercenaries <em>now</em> by killing one of their own.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  know a lot of people who would say it’s </em>always <em>a good time  to be a hired gun.  Me, I think I’d say quite the opposite.  Isn’t  that why I…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  didn’t quit, Minoru. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But I  did. I retired.  I stopped whoring my gun out to all but the most  inane of buyers, pretty much only for contracts that I wouldn’t  even have to fly to fill. Backyard shit. What the fuck am I doing  back here?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  money was too good. That was what you’d said.  The money was too  good, and he seemed </em>very <em>intent on having you.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>How  the hell did he even find my name? I’ve been retired for over a  year and a half. If what he’s saying is true, my name should have  been off the directory in six months. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  matter, Minoru thought, merited further investigation.  He had a  couple of people. A couple of <em>friends. </em>Even an old retired  sniper made friends now and then.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  happened to the rest of them?” he asked of a sudden. “What  happened to the rest of the kids?” He almost sounded like a  concerned parent when he asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Taken,  I’m afraid,” the man said a bit regretfully.  Minoru didn’t  like it one bit—it sounded like a man repenting over a bad business  deal, not a man who had just lost children to soldiers.  “When the  van was hit, we rushed a medevac to the area and started pulling  people out, but we’d only managed to get you and one other to the  van by the time their column hit the wreck zone.  The soldiers  panicked and fled. They’re being disciplined now, but the damage is  done.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you think…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If I  had to guess, I’d color them dead,” the man said with that same  note of regret, but this time there was something else to it.  He  scratched at his beard as he said it, and Minoru thought, <em>nervous  habit. Something to do with your hands so they don’t get in your  mouth’s way while you’re spitting bullshit. </em>“I’m afraid  our enemies want something entirely different from what we want, and  I think they’re willing to—and, indeed, intend to—kill to get what  they need.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  what is that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  afraid I can’t tell you much of that, either, I’m afraid.  It’s  none of your concern, in any case.  I’ve paid you, and so you  should consider our dealings at an end. I have a jet ready to fly you  out of the area, and it’ll leave in an hour. Your contract has been  purchased, so you have no choice in this matter.” The man sounded  almost frustrated. Minoru made a note of that, too.  “You weren’t  wounded badly, so I expect you’ll be able to walk out of here on  your own.  The man outside will escort you to your jet. As for me…”  he smiled, and Minoru thought that it was no kind of smile at all, “I  have a wheelchair to deliver to a young lady.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Which  is it?” Minoru blurted—something he rarely did—without meaning  to.  “Which of the girls, that is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man  gave him a queer look. “Her name is Natsuki Kuga. Does that mean  anything to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It did,  but damned if he was going to admit it.  He shrugged as best I could.   “I guess not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man  nodded.  “Well, then. Please excuse me,” he said, and then stood  and was gone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As he  left, Minoru found himself thinking a strange thought. A simple kid’s  phrase he hadn’t thought of in years: <em>Liar, liar, pants on  fire.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  for him, he caught onto what the man was lying about considerably  faster than Natsuki did.</span></p>
