<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  is a big one, ladies and gents. Very little character development; now  we're just going on what we have, because there's no time for them to  dive deep into themselves anymore. If you’re skeptical at the end, give  it some time and a few more chapters, and I promise you won’t be.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  case you’re curious, Switzerland has four official languages: German,  French, Italian, and Romanish (which is another romance language  descended from Latin.)</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For all of you unbelievers out there, remember that Minoru’s mother was British, and therefore he grew up bilingual.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Like acid and oil on a madman’s face / his reasons tend to fly away.</em></span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"> Astronomy, part one</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  thought at first that it was just the feeling of drugs wearing off; her  heart was beating out of her chest, and her nerves and senses felt on  fire. Her limbs were filled with a weird, intense sort of energy, as  though she had an extra muscle helping to move each one of them. Her  motions were more fluid, more controlled, and she felt more at ease  with her body than she had in a long time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even so, it was  strange to think of having one’s first extra-sensory premonition on the  roof of an elevator in a pitch-black shaft which smelled of acrid smoke  and one’s own sweat, but this was precisely what happened to Natsuki as  she mounted the ladder—which she found only by the grace of God, as it  was directly next to the crawlspace she’d just climbed out of. All at  once, the world went…not dark; it was already dark. The world went  dead. The clamor below Natsuki—big, angry men speaking in a language  she didn’t understand trying to force a very jammed elevator door open,  trying to rouse the “accountant,” trying to, presumably, kill her; the  cold feeling of the rusty ladder in her hand; the dull, thumping pain  underneath the pins and needles in her side and in her leg—vanished as  though it had never been, and all that she was left with was the voice  of…somebody who sounded too much like Shizuru to be anybody but her:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Come to me.</em><br />
  …<br />
  <em>Come to me.</em><br />
  (What is this? I don’t have time to fuck around, even in my head. Even about Shizuru.)<br />
  <em>Come to me, Natsuki.</em><br />
  (Shut the hell up. Where am I? Why can’t I see anything?) Where are you?<br />
  <em>I’m someplace not far from you.</em><br />
  (Could this really be her?) I want to come, but I can’t. I don’t know where you are.<br />
  <em>You can, Natsuki. It’s very close, after all.</em><br />
  (How is this possible? Did I get hit with a needle full of something?) Are you in this building?<br />
  <em>No. You’ll have to leave, but if you do, it’s only a few miles on foot.</em><br />
  I don’t think I can even make it out of here alive.<br />
  <em>You can, but I’m afraid that you might have to pay for it. Will you still come to me?</em><br />
  (I need to get out first.) Pay? Pay what?<br />
  <em>I can only keep it out a little bit longer, but if you don’t know  yet, I’ll try and make sure it doesn’t hit you too hard. The price is  very…painful.</em><br />
  What <em>price, </em>damn it? (Is she okay? She  sounds as though…as though she’s in pain. Can a voice in your head  sound that way?) If you would tell me something, I could—<br />
  <em>I have told you everything I can tell you, Natsuki. You’ll just have to get out of there. If you find Minoru, trust him.</em><br />
  Him? You know as well as I do you can’t trust him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<br />
  …Shizuru? (Oh god what the hell)<br />
  Words in a language she didn’t understand. The voice was male. Not like  Shizuru. Shizuru’s voice hadn’t quite been like Shizuru either. It had  been…more raw.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Since when is Minoru our friend?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  world returned to Natsuki. No time seemed to have passed, or at the  very least, her situation had not deteriorated in the slightest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Well, nobody’s shooting at me, anyway.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yet.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Looking  straight up, there was a small pocket of light at the very top of the  elevator shaft. It was a very long way up, but it occurred more than  briefly to Natsuki that if the power in this building was gone—and it  did, indeed, seem that way, though Natsuki had no idea for how  long—that this was probably her best bet for getting out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Unfortunately,  climbing the ladder presented a problem: While her arms were fairly  strong, and she was pretty sure she could climb on two arms and one  leg, letting her funny-feeling leg hang a little bit, (so that she  would, hopefully, be able to run when she had to) she only had one arm,  since she was holding a gun in the other. She would have to stuff the  gun somewhere, and since she was wearing pants—not the jeans she had  worn before the shit had hit the fan that night, but almost…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Is this a prison uniform?</em> Strange that she should think about it now, for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was a two-piece jumpsuit, and Natsuki hadn’t really thought to consider  its color, but it was loose except at the waist, so Natsuki figured she  could probably hold a gun in there at least temporarily. Maybe. Very  maybe.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I really, really don’t feel like doing this, </em>she thought, but she realized that she needed to keep a gun, so she did it anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>This is probably a Swiss gun, </em>she  thought as she felt around the left side of the gun: There was a  four-point safety system (a decocking lever, a firing pin safety, a  notch to make sure you didn’t accidentally trigger the pin, and a  trigger bar disconnecter) and a short barrel, almost as long as the  grip itself. Probably a P220. She stuck with just the pin safety: It  was important to not blow another hole in her side, but it was also  important to make sure that she didn’t spend her chance at shooting the  bad guys fiddling with a safety system she had only used twice before,  and only at an underground range that wasn’t actually legal.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  stuffed the gun in her pants and started climbing. It got easier.  Nobody found her, since nobody could actually see her. Eventually the  meatsacks below her got the door open and managed to rescue the  “accountant,” but nobody ever really thought to try and shoot her.  Maybe they thought she couldn’t escape, or maybe they <em>knew </em>it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Either way, it doesn’t bode so awfully well for me.</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
For  Minoru, the easy part had been bypassing the circuit breaker and  blowing the base’s power system. With Shiratori coaching him, it had  been twice as easy; the man was a fucking whiz with this stuff.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The tough part, he thought as people started running around the  base, which turned into a clamor of noise in half a second, even though  it was broad daylight outside, would be getting out of a base which was  currently populated by a bunch of loud, very fast, very armed Swiss  mercenaries, looking like he did—namely, not Swiss. He had a pistol—a  silenced USP—but he was quite certain that even though he was a  prodigious close-ranged marksman, he simply did not have the ammo  stockpile nor the invincible skin necessary to shoot his way out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If  nobody shows up to check this room, I can stay here until nightfall and  ditch then, but what are the odds that nobody’s going to check this  room by nightfall? In fact, what are the odds that nobody is going to  check this room in the next twenty minutes, being as how I just caused  a major power outage?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Briefly, he wondered if he had killed  anybody. He supposed it was possible; really, he had no idea precisely  what had happened when he stuck that enormous metal stake into the  ground; he only knew that the wiring coming into the building had  started to smoke like a motherfucker.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Real smart, old man.  You’ve got your way in, but you’ve got dick for a way out.  Real smart.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In addition, it seemed that Shiratori wasn’t picking up his phone anymore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was on thinking this that Minoru realized that he had been played for a fool.  Or rather, got the idea into his head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Shiratori  is shacking up with a woman named Inoue Nakahara when he’s not avoiding  his wife; I even asked how she was doing while I was trying to wheedle  a wire out of its casing. Inoue has a shady job at best: She’s  ex-military, but not like half of our high-school dropout salarymen are  ex-military. She did more than just get learn how to point a gun away  from yourself and piddle around a JASDF base; she moved up. Started  instituting some major changes in her unit, going so far as to get  herself thrown out for slipping the both the male </em>and <em>female members of that squad hormone-suppression drugs. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You’re  being paranoid, Minoru. How many good commanders have gotten themselves  thrown out of the military? Any one of them could be running the enemy  camp. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But it makes sense, doesn’t it?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>In that twisted, </em>life-is-less-a-mystery-than-a-series-of-kicks-in-the-crotch <em>sort  of way that you’re so fond of, yes. Stop being a dick. Shiratori’s  probably boning Inoue right now. Or masturbating. Or fondling women on  a train. Or doing </em>anything <em>that doesn’t involve setting you up to take a fall for the enemy camp. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even so.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It made sense. In a paranoid sort of way, it made a hell of a lot of sense.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Either way, if he doesn’t pick up his damn phone and soon, you’re probably going to die.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  were probably going to die anyway. That was what you were going for,  wasn’t it? Blaze of glory? Can’t die of old age, especially not if you  die to save some kids you barely know.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>We’ve been through this. Keep your cynical trap shut. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The door rattled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru’s  stomach jerked. He raised the gun to what he judged was head level,  then, since most of the people out there were more Aryan than Japanese,  raised it a little higher. Looking down the barrel brought a strange  sort of peace to his mind, but his heart was still pounding.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Before today, I think it had been at least ten years since I killed anybody up close. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Hell of a day, huh.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Huh.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They probably wouldn’t take him prisoner again. He was supposed to be dead already, right?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Thunk-thunk-thunk-wham</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somebody was hitting the door and saying something in a language he didn’t understand.  It sounded like Italian.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Thunk-thunk-thunk-wham</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Whoever  was out there didn’t know that Minoru was inside, that much was  certain: Nobody was shouting, and Minoru couldn’t hear that tightness  of the throat that accompanied soldiers into close, bloody infighting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>They won’t toss a grenade in here. That would run the risk of breaking something </em>really <em>important.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So  you’ll get to kill two or three guys before somebody in a vest twists  in here and takes your head off. Must be your lucky day. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  spite of himself, Minoru found himself backing up against the wall a  little harder. He supposed, in an absent part of his mind, that this  was just instinct, but it still seemed silly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then something <em>really </em>silly happened: Minoru’s foot pressed hard against a brick, and it came loose.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Thunk-thunk-thunk-</em>crack.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A brick building with a wood door. </em>That’s <em>innovation. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru bent down, not bothering to keep his gun on the door. <em>Whether  you kill one or none at all won’t matter for shit, Minoru. If they  recognize you they’ll kill you, and if they don’t they’ll haul you in  for being in here and </em>then <em>kill you. </em>The brick not only  came loose, but pushed out all the way. Minoru’s heart did a little  loop-the-loop, and for half a second he let himself think that he might  just get out of here. <em>If I can pull a few more bricks, I should be able to dig down and slide out.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Thunk-thunk-thunk-</em>crack.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A new voice, with a tone of authority.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The first voice, angry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The new voice, yelling something.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A jiggle of the handle. <em>A key? </em>Minoru froze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then, blissfully, the sound of several men walking away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  pulled three more bricks out from alongside the one that he had pulled  first. He realized that this was bound to make the building very  unstable at some point, but rationalized that probably not all of the  bricks were loose like this. Nowhere in his rationale was that even a  little brick shack probably had an underground foundation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Click.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  whipped around just in time to see the door open. Just in time to see a  big white man pop his head in and say something in Italian.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  froze, and then some strange, untapped circuit in his head kicked into  gear and he turned around. A big man peered in and gave Minoru a funny  look, and for a full half of a second Minoru was quite sure he was  about to be killed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then the moment passed, and Minoru thought  without thinking, planned without concentrating, and bent down, grabbed  one of the tools—which, he did not take time to consider—that he had  dropped so carelessly when he was finished with them and began to  unscrew the circuit breaker’s lid, which he had entirely neglected  during the course of his sabotage, as though he had been simply  startled by the noise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He knew, but did not actively consider that he could not speak to these men in Japanese.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  thought that if he could communicate on any level with this man he  could claim to be some sort of contracted worker, but he did not think  up a believable back-story to support this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He had an idea that  as long as he acted confident, he would be accepted, but he did not  justify this by pointing out, rightly, that every mercenary unit had to  repopulate on the fly sometimes, and so could not be picky about  recruiting exclusively from one place or another.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then, he  said in the English that his mother had taught him, “I think there’s a  problem with some underground wiring. Also, this building is very  unstable. If we get some time, we should move the generator to  someplace more stable.” He prayed to a god he did not fully believe in  that the man did not notice the large metal stake that was connected to  the ground and the other end of the circuit breaker, and moved  subconsciously to block it from view a little better, even though it  was already shrouded in shadow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man paused for a moment, and then said, also in heavily accented, very clumsy English, “Why did you lock yourself in?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru managed to say, “Loud outside,”without stuttering. “I should have the power back on in a few minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good. Very sorry my men scared you. Dumb bastard didn’t ask for the key.” The man laughed heartily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry about it,” Minoru said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Leave the door open,” the man said. “Smells awful in here. Like smoke.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You got it,” Minoru said, his heart thumping.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then the man left and said something loud in Italian. Laughter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something loud over a loudspeaker somebody had dug up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru let himself relax very slowly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I can’t turn the power back on. Even if I could, if Natsuki is making a quick escape, she probably wouldn’t appreciate it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  made a show of fiddling around with the circuit breaker for a while,  and then somebody popped his head in again and said in English, “How is  the power?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Fuck it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The wires are fried,” Minoru said. “All through this building. Do you have a gas generator?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can get one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s probably a backup lighting system somewhere.  I can find it and we can get lights at least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay. I will find a generator.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  man shouted something else, and the men began to leave, their footsteps  sounding with a practiced rhythm. And then, it was quiet around what  was very nearly Minoru’s grave.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru bolted. Nobody saw him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  he didn’t bolt towards the exit. He could have probably made a show of  trying to get cell phone reception and walking out towards the forest,  and dressed as he was—very plainly—he might have been able to make it,  too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instead, he went for the compound again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">--</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki was about three-quarters of the way up when her assumption came back to bite her in the ass.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">More  accurately, her assumption dropped out of her ass. Her gun, with no  sign that it was even loose, perhaps due to a misplaced foot or a  too-quick motion, or maybe just due to the fact that if there <em>was </em>a God in his heaven, he really, <em>really </em>didn’t like Natsuki, slipped off of her waist, fell down through her pant leg, and clattered down the ladder to make a very, <em>very </em>loud <em>clank </em>on the roof of the elevator.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Oh, shit.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She started climbing faster.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was easier than it had been when she’d started. Her leg barely even hurt anymore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  the hell is this? Before I could barely even move my leg, and now it’s  like nothing happened to it. This can’t just be adrenaline. </em>She confirmed this by moving her hand to her side, and then to her leg. No blood.  The gashes were gone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  made it to the top and popped her head up for just a second, checking  to see if it was clear. She heard somebody speaking very loudly in a  Romance language of some sort—probably Italian or Spanish, she couldn’t  tell—through a microphone of some sort—probably a hand-held  loudspeaker—and she saw a pant leg.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Shit. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Hold on.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was a jean leg.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Military types in jeans?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The leg bent down, and Minoru Alder was crouching next to her, all at once. His eyes went wide.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Natsuki?</em>” he mouthed, and then, without saying another word, offered his hand and helped her out of the shaft.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Minoru?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When she was up and out, she looked at him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you doing here?” Natsuki whispered to him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Listening to a rousing speech, obviously.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Cute.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But,  she thought, it was. A little. He was obviously scared—she could see  that in the pale tint of his skin, in the way his eyes moved a little  too quickly whenever he looked around.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He noticed. “It’s been a  long time since I’ve been this close to this many people who want to  kill me,” he admitted. “I’d feel a lot better if I were a quarter mile  away holding a rifle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The honesty made her smile. “It’s been a  long time since I’ve been in this kind if situation too,” she said, and  he nodded, apparently unsurprised. <em>Does he know?</em> “And last time I had a bit of a leg up on everybody.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He nodded again.  “This time, instead of having a leg up, you have a good-looking old man with a pistol.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have a gun?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I figured it was better than a slingshot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  just then, her assumption, which had already bitten her posterior badly  once came back for another go, apparently tantalized by the flavor of  her buttocks. Because apparently, somebody <em>had </em>heard that gun  drop. And that same somebody had known the layout of this building well  enough to know where the ouside exit to the elevator shaft was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And that was when Natsuki and Minoru found themselves surrounded by about ten large men with assault rifles.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And the accountant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Oh, shit.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minoru Alder,” the accountant said, his voice raspy. Minoru smiled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re a pretty bad liar, scratch-ass,” Minoru said, the tightness of his voice destroying his confident image.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The accountant raised an eyebrow. “Are we twelve now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wonder.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The accountant shrugged, and Natsuki said, “Do you know this man, Minoru?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He hired me to watch you, originally.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kill the man,” the accountant said. “Take the girl. We no longer need her as a bargaining chip, but we’ll need her later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you sure, sir?” one of the soldiers said in Japanese.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Positive. You have your orders. Tonight at sundown.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sir.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  moved himself slightly in front of Natsuki, and it was now that Natsuki  had her second extra-sensory premonition, in an equally inconvenient  time as the first:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Natsuki. You have to pay the price. We all do.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What price?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You know.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>(I do know but I don’t want it oh god there’s nothing I want less I would rather die)</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I can’t. I can’t go back to that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  have to. We all do. We don’t have a choice. He can’t keep it out  forever, and neither can I. You can’t let Minoru die, not just yet.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">How do you know about that?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m connected now. It’s so…so painful, but even then, it’s not half as painful as what </em>he <em>feels. Let me relieve him. His pain…it hurts me, as well. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">(Comprehension. Bitter comprehension.)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…Will we have to do it again, Shizuru?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I think there’s a way to stop it this time, but we will have to be quick.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I don’t want this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You’re a strong girl, Natsuki.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’m not.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You are.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I can’t even say things I want to say. Not even to myself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I love you, Natsuki.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But I can’t say it back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Try. Try and then if I die, I can die happy.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>They will kill me if they don’t get results soon. There are plenty more of us here. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Please, Natsuki. Please trust me. Trust </em>us.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I…can’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You can.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">How can you say that?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Because I know you as well as you know you, but unlike you, I won’t lie.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">How? How can you know anything if I’ve never let you in?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You have. You are too stubborn to notice, but you have. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">How can you say that?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Natsuki, please don’t make me repeat myself over and over.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There’s no time anymore, is there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>There isn’t. It’s time. You will have to trust me.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I…do.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Hearing that makes me very happy, Natsuki. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Save that. You may not want to thank me shortly.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And it was true.  For in the next instant, something hit Natsuki so hard that for a moment she was sure she had been shot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  in the seconds following that, as a green, incandescent light began to  radiate from her hands, she knew it was much worse than being shot.</span></p>

<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Three syllables. </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Not much longer now.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Three syllables.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  door guards are long gone now. They’ve fled from the madness they hear  inside the cell. The voice is ragged and worn now, because it has been  speaking for hours straight, without ever stopping, now so quickly that  it has become frightening.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>mi…<br />
  ro…<br />
  ku…<br />
  miroku<br />
  miroku<br />
  miroku miroku miroku miroku miroku  mirokumirokumirokumirokumirokumirokumirokumirokumirokumirokumirokumirokumirokumirokumirokumirokumirokumiroku</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Something  hums through the air. The guard is being changed, and two men are  wandering towards the door, wondering where the other guards went,  cursing because they’ll have to report the bastards for abandoning  their posts. What a pain.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The guards don’t hum, though. After a second, they hear it. Where is it coming from? It seems like it’s coming from a wall. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>One  of the guards presses his ears to the wall, and a second later the hum  becomes nearly deafening. The guard has just enough time to pull back  in horror and then the wall splits bursts open and an enormous sword,  nearly the size of the man himself, cleaves him in two. The other man  doesn’t even have enough time to be shocked. The sword seeks him out  and severs his head, and then bursts through the wall and lands  parallel to the Entire World, which has splinters and edges that will  leave her back permanently scarred. It cuts through the thick chains  which bind her to the Entire World, circling her little crotch and  waist and wrists and thighs. It makes a sick little </em>splash <em>because it lands in a pool of her vomit. She has stopped coughing now.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Because  the power is there again. It is no longer like touching a barely-live  battery to her tongue. Now she has taken the plunge and hooked it  straight to her heart, which thumps as though it will burst out of her  chest. This is exciting. This is exhilarating. This is</em><br />
  power<br />
  <em>yes. Power. They have hurt Mai, and by her power they will live only long enough to regret it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And no longer.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Miroku dragging behind her, scraping maddeningly on the metal floor, Mikoto begins to walk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">--</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi  and Mai’s plan did not work as they had planned it, but that was  coincidence. In truth, it might have—a small team had, indeed, been  dispatched to their cell when their monitoring device went offline.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  then, something happened. Shizuru’s screams stopped, and then Reito  screamed, a single loud, piercing scream which contained the feelings  of a man who has failed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In truth, it was not his fault.  But that did not stop him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then Midori began to scream as well; that same frustrated, angry scream that she had let out before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then Mai began to scream. Her body began to spark in Aoi’s arms, and  before Aoi could even think about letting go, she was thrown back  against the wall by an invisible force strong enough that it ought to  have knocked her out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But it didn’t, and that wasn’t what scared Aoi the most.  What scared Aoi the most was that now <em>she </em>began to spark as well.  Something new and intense pounded inside of her, and suddenly, she was <em>aware.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Chie is alive.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Chie is alive and in this cell block. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chie!” she shouted as loudly as she could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A…Aoi? </em>The reply came hesitantly, and Aoi’s heart leapt and suddenly nothing seemed wrong with the world anymore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That was in my head. That was not out loud.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What the hell?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I don’t care. It’s </em>Chie. <em>She’s alive. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where are you, Chie?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m in a cell with Shiho. She’s acting really funny…she’s just…screaming. Loud.  Why can I hear you in my head?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>…What? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi  had no more time to think about it, because in the next instant, the  door opened and seven armed guards forced their way into the cell and  surrounded her and Mai, who had not stopped screaming.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut her  up,” one of them said, shouting to be heard over the piercing screams  which came not only from Mai, but which echoed all down the corridor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  now all of them were screams like Midori’s. Rage. Frustration. That  feeling only felt in the face of something enormous and evil which you  know will consume everything you love, which you are powerless to stop.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jesus Christ,” the soldier said. “What is this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then, all at once, Mai stopped screaming. She stood up straight, her  shirt in tatters, her eyes once again blank and somewhere near insane.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mai,”  Aoi whispered, and then stood and moved to her, feeling no pain when  she should have had a concussion from being hurled so hard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She took her hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s going on, Mai?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can feel it too?” the other girl whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll know soon enough.” And then, to the solders, “You should leave. I don’t want to kill anybody.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Keep  your mouth shut,” the soldier said. “Sit down and stay quiet. I don’t  know how you managed to break that damn thing, but we’ll have to move  you to a new cell now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Mai whispered. “You don’t understand at all. None of you understand, and that’s why none of you are going to survive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All at once, the entire hall was silent.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  tried to contain us,” Mai said. “But you don’t understand that that’s  impossible. Your machines can hold us, but the problem is that <em>you </em>can’t. Your machines can control that energy, but <em>you </em>can’t. Not even <em>we </em>can.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  soldiers took a step back and raised their weapons. “We can call it a  misfire,” one of them said. “At worst, we’ll be thrown out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  too late for that now,” Mai whispered, and tears began to well in her  eyes. “I’m very sorry. I’ll try not to kill you, but I can’t control it  either. It’s too strong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai was kind, but she was still human, after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Though, now, not wholly.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Inoue  Nakahara was just beginning to receive damage reports when her husband  and the general commander of their army, Kenji Nakahara, touched her  shoulder and received an electric shock powerful enough to knock him on  his ass. A moment later, something powerful and electric flowed  straight through her, barely stopping at all, and she let out a  horrified scream and fainted.
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Midori hugged Reito tightly from behind as the soldiers burst into their cell. Both of their eyes were filled with tears.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry,” he whispered to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry about it,” she whispered back. “We can deal with this. <em>He </em>is still dead, so it can’t start again. It can’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But now it’s me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have faith in you, as does Shizuru.  That’s why she told you to let go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stand  up. Keep your hands where we can see them,” one of the soldiers  commanded. They all wore the same black uniforms they had the night  before. “Nobody move.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori did, but Reito couldn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Get him up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut it,” Midori said. “He’s in pain. It’s amazing he’s still conscious, you insensitive bastard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Our orders are to keep you both standing. Satou,” he said, turning to one of his comrades, “get him up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sir.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Satou  walked towards Reito, and Midori saw her opportunity in an instant. It  was in the way he walked too quickly, not taking time to consider his  footing as carefully as he should. He was probably new, eager to please.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  moved faster than anybody could believe, herself included. It was just  that her body felt on fire, charged with energy she hadn’t felt since  the HiME carnival. It made her a little sick, but mostly it gave her  strength and she was grateful for that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And she knew, felt as  clearly as she might have felt a strong wind, that if she got outside  of the cell, she would feel even more power.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The HiME carnival can’t start again. It’s impossible. The Obsidian Lord </em>is <em>dead.  The star should have been destroyed too, but something must have  happened. I don’t know what. Maybe it can never really be destroyed.  Maybe the star was just in incarnation of something else. We can figure  that out later. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Without the carnival, we should be able to avoid killing each other this time around.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But then, why do I get this feeling of futility whenever I think about it?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  one instant, the soldier was moving towards Reito. In the next, Midori  was in front of him. She lashed out with a high kick that landed  directly in his stomach, sending him sprawling backwards, and Midori  moved in then, seizing her chance, plowing straight into the whole  group of them, winding up in the hallway with three still inside,  dazed, and three outside, on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The energy nearly knocked her over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then it was in her hand. The blade was sharp and polished, the shaft sturdy. Just like she had left it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Looking at it, she knew she should be relieved, but she couldn’t feel anything but sick.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
A/N:
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yes, I'm aware that the HiME didn't have any sort of telepathic or  electrical powers in the series. Yes, all of this is deliberate; their  powers are not quite the same as they were in the series, and this will  make sense. Trust me on this one, guys.</span></p>
