<h1>Unfinished Dishes</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bernium.html">Bernium</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was a late evening in summer, and above a large house in suburban 
Kyoto, faint streaks of powder blue fought, then dispersed into a 
darkening sky. As the lamps along the street glowed into life, the 
Kuga-Fujino household was uncharacteristically quiet. 

Shizuru had somehow persuaded Natsuki into the bedroom again. Shifting 
irritably from her cross-legged position on the bed, Natsuki sighed and 
brought one leg up, leaning her chin heavily on it. Her smooth brow 
creased, marking the impatience in her sea-green eyes.

Damn, what was that woman up to? It wasn&#39;t even 9pm...and she wanted to 
clean up the kitchen and continue working on this week&#39;s project. 
Suddenly, as if in answer, the bathroom door opened. Smiling wickedly, 
Shizuru walked out and sat down beside her on the bed, flaxen brown hair 
falling in loose waves on bare white shoulders. Natsuki&#39;s right eyebrow 
twitched in disbelief. What! Are you really wearing 
...nothing...but...but...our kitchen apron...? Other than the obvious, 
the movement of Shizuru&#39;s smooth and shapely thighs beneath the pink 
material quickly put the answer beyond doubt. Against her delicate skin, 
the roughly colored cotton made a strange and tantalizing contrast. 
Natsuki felt her eyes bugging out. Was their apron that small? Shizuru 
had evidently tied the straps rather lower and tighter than usual - 
there was enough cleavage showing to induce a heart attack. Unable to 
tear her eyes away, Natsuki breathed in deeply, &quot;Shizuru...&quot; In reply, 
the taller woman simply wrapped her arms around Natsuki&#39;s neck and began 
to lick her cheek gently and amorously. Few people knew Shizuru had a 
very long tongue. In fact, only one knew just how long.

&quot;Natsuki...the kids are doing their homework...don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time 
for dessert?&quot;

&quot;Mou, Shizuru, isn&#39;t it a little early? I should...do the dishes...&quot;

&quot;Forget the dishes.&quot; Shizuru started licking Natsuki&#39;s ear, tracing the 
curves inside with a pointed tip. Though she was still frowning lightly, 
Natsuki&#39;s lips parted without herself noticing. The muscles on her neck 
began to tense. Gradually, the teasing slowed, then Shizuru whispered 
hoarsely into her ear,

&quot;I want you now.&quot;

The dark-haired woman closed her eyes. She couldn&#39;t help feeling Shizuru 
moving her soft, full breasts against her arm through the cotton fabric 
of her t-shirt. Natsuki shivered and moved her legs together, growing 
wet. Between shallow breaths she struggled to think, &quot;Shizuru! How do 
you expect me to wear that apron again without thinking dirty thoughts! 
I can&#39;t believe you...eight years and you still keep jumping me. I 
swear, you are a sex maniac!&quot;

Shizuru giggled at the exasperated yet aroused expression on Natsuki&#39;s 
face. &quot;Natsuki? Are you unhappy at something?&quot;

&quot;You bet I am. Watch out!&quot;

Natsuki turned to face Shizuru, pushing her suddenly onto the bed. 
Landing on the downy mattress with a thump, Shizuru looked up at Natsuki 
and grinned, crimson eyes gleaming with desire, her face loving, 
lascivious and amused all at once. Natsuki couldn&#39;t help but grin as 
well. &quot;What the heck. She&#39;s so gorgeous when she&#39;s like that...&quot; Leaning 
over Shizuru, she planted a lingering kiss on those angelic lips, moving 
her own in a warm caress. Shizuru&#39;s eyes fluttered shut. Soon Natsuki 
had to close hers as well. When Shizuru&#39;s tongue snaked into her mouth 
and touched hers, it ignited a burning, tingling wave of desire, 
spreading throughout her body and gripping her with lust. It felt 
exactly like the first time they had made love...except that the 
seductive, curvaceous body beneath her hands was now as familiar to her 
as her own skin.

As Shizuru&#39;s arms entwined about her neck, she removed the apron nimbly 
and tossed it blindly aside, then placed her hands just below Shizuru&#39;s 
full breasts and massaged them, thumbs stroking her evident arousal. 
Shizuru shuddered and sighed softly, restrained even in passion. Natsuki 
smiled knowingly to herself, &quot;Or at least at the start...&quot; Biting 
Shizuru softly on the neck, she savoured the sharp gasp this elicited. 
The urge to possess Shizuru became painfully unbearable as she moved her 
hands down her body, holding her down forcefully. Panting, she 
maneuvered her slim, naked hips between her wife&#39;s legs and pushed down 
into a furnace of heat. &quot;Aaaah...she&#39;s soaking wet. God...&quot; When her 
fingers slid into the center of that heat, Shizuru tilted her head back 
and cried out, briefly. Slender fingertips gripped Natsuki&#39;s back as 
they fell into a primal rhythm, undulating with rough, thirsting strokes 
against each other, gasping with desire. At that moment, every movement 
was a blaze of pleasure through Natsuki. The world began to contract 
around just Shizuru and her...

Then she heard something.

&quot;Okaa-san? Mama?&quot;

Natsuki stiffened and jolted upright. Shizuru jumped in her arms as 
well. Whipping her head round, jaw hanging open, she looked at the 
doorway, light spilling through and illuminating their daughters, 
Shizuka and Natsumi.

&quot;AAAARGH!&quot;

Natsuki&#39;s jaw fell further. She looked at Shizuru, who was blushing, 
with her hand to her mouth. &quot;Ara, ara...&quot; Raising one arm up, fingers 
spread, she futilely attempted to shield their children from being 
scarred. Naturally, she ended up collapsing on the shocked woman below.

&quot;Oof!&quot; &quot;Aargh!&quot; Finally recovering, she covered Shizuru with the 
blanket, and leapt towards the door. Feeling her face burning, Natsuki 
blocked the entrance and tried to pull her jaw up. &quot;Uh.&quot; Shizuka looked 
puzzled. &quot;Okaa-san...is Mama sick? Why is she naked? And she sounded 
like she was in pain...Um...Natsumi was getting sleepy...we came to say 
goodnight...&quot; Beside her, a picture of cuteness, Natsumi yawned hugely.

&quot;Ah! Shi-chan! Mama had indigestion.&quot;

Behind her, Shizuru&#39;s expression was priceless.

&quot;See? And we had to exercise to make it go away. So, so...bring Natsumi 
back to bed first, we&#39;ll come right away to tuck her in.&quot;

When they had padded down the hallway to their room, Natsuki shut the 
door in a panic and whipped around to place her back to it, face 
contorting wildly and uncontrollably. She stared at Shizuru, grinning 
insanely, face twitching, eyes full of horror. Shizuru took one look at 
her and put her hand over her mouth, laughing so hard that she finally 
gave up and wrapped both arms around her stomach. Her graceful Kyoto 
lady&#39;s image was quite ruined when she starting rolling on the bed. When 
her face finally stopped of its own accord, Natsuki snorted and laughed 
heartily along with her, leaning heavily against the door.

&quot;We are never, NEVER doing that again.&quot;

&quot;Is that so? But my stomach&#39;s rather delicate...I often have 
indigestion, you know.&quot;

Shizuru finished putting on her nightgown, walked up to her and patted 
her lightly on her butt. Natsuki just rolled her eyes.

&quot;Okaa-san...better put some pants on.&quot;

&quot;AAAAAARGH!!!&quot;
