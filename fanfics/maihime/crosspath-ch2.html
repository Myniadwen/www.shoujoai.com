<a href="../maihime/crosspath-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;So,&quot; Reito Kanzaki smiled as the black haired
president of the student council walked by Yukino&#39;s
side, &quot;has Chie gotten out of the dog house yet?&quot;

Yukino smiled wryly, her short brown hair giving her a
boyish look. &quot;Well, I think Aoi has finally calmed
down,&quot; she said as she pushed up her glasses, &quot;though
I expect Erstin won&#39;t be talking to her for a long
time to come.&quot;

&quot;Poor child,&quot; Reito nodded. He looked concerned as he
waved charmingly to several students, &quot;Is there
anything I can do?&quot;

Yukino shook her head gravely as she answered, &quot;Not
unless you have a miracle cure for a broken heart.&quot;

&quot;Well, I think all of us could use something like that
at one time or another,&quot; Reito noted just a bit sadly.

Yukino looked up at him in surprise, but Reito&#39;s
expression was largely unreadable. &#39;I wonder if he was
more serious about Mai than I thought?&#39; she mused as
they left the school halls and went out into the open
air.

&quot;Yukino-sempai,&quot; Erstin Ho smiled as she saw them
coming, the younger blonde waiting as promised by the
front doors.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Reito hid a smile as he slipped away.

&quot;You don&#39;t need to call me that,&quot; Yukino reminded her,
even though she was secretly a bit tickled that a
fellow student viewed her as a upperclassman.
Especially from a girl that was actually a bit taller
than she was.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Erstin blushed cutely.

&#39;Nina Wang,&#39; Yukino thought as she met the girl&#39;s kind
gaze, &#39;is a idiot.&#39; She smiled as she asked, &quot;Lunch in
the cafeteria?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Erstin agreed. As they walked along
she looked over at Yukino, &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you know
why the rumors have suddenly stopped?&quot;

&#39;Uh oh,&#39; Yukino thought, silently debating what to
say. Deciding honesty was the best policy she
confessed, &quot;I had a word with Chie, and she&#39;s putting
her network to work on squashing the story.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Erstin said softly. She made a face as
she added, &quot;Chie came to me and apologized too.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Yukino nodded.

While she talked a faint smile tugged at Erstin&#39;s
lips, &quot;Rumor says that Aoi refused to talk to her till
she did.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure it was quite that bad,&quot; Yukino said
wryly, &quot;but Aoi was certainly annoyed with her.&quot; They
entered the busy cafeteria, both collecting their
favorite items before heading to a table. &quot;How are
things in class?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Better than I was expecting,&quot; Erstin conceded as she
snapped her wooden chopsticks apart. &quot;I think having
Shizuru and her fans here has made people a little
more accepting than they might otherwise be.&quot;

&#39;I sometimes underestimate her brains, then she says
something like that,&#39; Yukino mused. A bit tentatively
she asked, &quot;And Nina?&quot;

Erstin swallowed her soup uncomfortably, her face
pained. &quot;We&#39;re still not talking,&quot; she softly
admitted.

Yukino reached out to pat Erstin&#39;s hand gently.
&quot;Sometimes it takes a while for people to adapt,&quot; she
offered.

&quot;Do you really think so?&quot; Erstin gave Yukino a
searching look, her eyes filled with lingering pain.

Yukino debated what she should say then answered
quietly, &quot;When my sempai found out about my feelings
for her, it created problems but we did get over it.&quot;

&quot;Haruka-san?&quot; Erstin guessed.

&quot;Hmm.&quot; Yukino nodded slightly, &quot;Has the rumor been
circulating again?&quot;

A faint blush colored Erstin&#39;s cheeks, &quot;I was sort of
told it by a friend when they heard I was working with
you.&quot;

&quot;Warned away from the evil lesbian?&quot; Yukino looked
amused rather than offended by the whole idea.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Erstin blushed cutely.

&quot;Heh,&quot; Yukino actually chuckled softly.

&quot;It was Nina who warned me,&quot; Erstin looked
thoughtfully off into the distance, &quot;I wonder if that
means something?&quot;

Deciding it might be best to change the topic Yukino
asked, &quot;Did you have a chance to write up the notes
for yesterday&#39;s meeting?&quot;

Much more cheerfully they talked business for a bit,
including a bit of student council gossip too.
Chatting with Erstin Yukino noted how the girl&#39;s eyes
could sparkle, her naturally cheery manner overcoming
her lingering sorrow to brighten up the room.

&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Erstin murmured, a slight smile on her face
as she saw who had entered.

Turning a bit in her chair Yukino saw Mai and Mikoto
enter the room, then swiftly realized she had earlier
seen Tate and Shiho cuddling at a corner table. &quot;How
annoyed is Mikoto at Tate right now?&quot; she mused.

&quot;Ah, quite a bit I heard,&quot; Erstin admitted.

&quot;I&#39;d better go intercept her,&quot; Yukino sighed, getting
up and briskly heading over to where Mai and Mikoto
were walking through the crowded cafeteria.

Erstin watched her go, once again struck by Yukino&#39;s
confident, bold manner. Yet she also had a sweet,
gentle side totally at odds with being the head of the
executive and the doer of dirty work for the student
council. In the two months Erstin had known Yukino she
had always taken the time to help, even when she
probably had things of her own to do too.

&#39;Like with Mai now,&#39; Erstin mused as Yukino and Mai
talked, the shorter woman doing her best to fend off a
possible scene that would have gotten both couples in
trouble.

&quot;That was close,&quot; Yukino sighed as she returned.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Erstin blinked.

&quot;Mikoto had her practice sword with her and fully
intended to use it on Tate&#39;s head,&quot; Yukino explained
with a wry smile.

&quot;Her versus Tate would be a sight to see,&quot; Erstin
noted.

An odd look passed over Yukino&#39;s face, almost like she
was remembering something. &quot;Trust me,&quot; she said as she
polished off her meal, &quot;Tate wouldn&#39;t stand a chance.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Erstin asked but Yukino just shook her head with
a mysteious smile on her face.

&quot;Well well,&quot; the voice purred from behind Yukino,
&quot;isn&#39;t she a bit young for you?&quot;

&quot;Nao,&quot; Yukino said flatly as she turned.

Nao Yuuki wore the same sort of uniform as everyone
her grade, yet somehow the redhead made it look sexier
as she looked at them with wicked implications in her
smirk. &quot;Though I must admit,&quot; Nao added as she looked
Erstin over, &quot;you have good taste.&quot;

&quot;Rein in your imagination,&quot; Yukino gave Nao a
surprisingly dangerous look, &quot;we&#39;re collegues on the
student council.&quot; A smile teased her lips as she
looked over at Erstin a moment, &quot;And friends.&quot;

&quot;Too bad,&quot; Nao looked amused, &quot;think of the stories
that would spread if you caught her on the rebound.&quot;

&quot;Miss Yuuki,&quot; Erstin frowned.

&quot;What do you want, Nao?&quot; Yukino said, trying not to
let on how much the redhead was annoying her. &#39;Would
it be abusing my powers as head of the Executive if I
had Chie investigate her? I&#39;m sure we could find
something to charge her for,&#39; she thought.

Nao smiled a very catlike smile. &quot;I&#39;m just here to see
a friend,&quot; she nodded towards Mikoto, &quot;and thought I&#39;d
say hi.&quot; She smiled as she sauntered away, &quot;Bye!&quot;

&quot;Is she always like that?&quot; Erstin asked after a long
moment of silence.

&quot;Occasionally,&quot; Yukino admitted, &quot;though not so often
since she became a nun.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s a nun?!&quot; Erstin looked disbelieving.

&quot;I think she&#39;s Sister Yukariko&#39;s current redemption
project,&quot; Yukino shrugged wryly.

&quot;That&#39;s going to take some work,&quot; Erstin murmured.</pre>
