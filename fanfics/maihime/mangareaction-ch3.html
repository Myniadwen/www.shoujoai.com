Mai Hime: The Manga Reaction

Final

&quot;Why are we doing a random hot springs episode at the
beginning of volume four?&quot; Haruka wondered. &quot;Such
blatant nudity!&quot;

&quot;Sex sells books,&quot; Nao Yuuki noted.

&quot;But who would want to look at you?&#39; Natsuki wondered.

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m pretty hot,&quot; Nao protested, &quot;and I have the
fan-club to prove it.&quot;

&quot;What, those dirty old men you like to abuse?&quot; Natsuki
sniffed.

Nao shook her head, &quot;Better that than your lesbian
fanclub.&quot;

Mai flipped ahead in their scripts then gasped softly.
&quot;It was WHO?&quot; Mai blurted out at the revelation of who
the Obsidian Lord really was in the manga series.

&quot;It&#39;s always the last person you inspect,&quot; Haruka
muttered.

&quot;Expect, not inspect,&quot; Yukino corrected gently.

Haruka blushed then kissed Yukino&#39;s cheek, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Natsuki muttered, &quot;I was almost hoping it
would be Tate.&quot;

The brown haired young man looked up in surprise as
Tate asked, &quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot;

Natsuki smirked, &quot;It&#39;d give me a better excuse to beat
you bloody.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Shiho protested, &quot;Don&#39;t threaten big brother!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get too cocky just because you got to be a
princess in this version,&quot; Shizuru warned with a cool
smile, &quot;Mai still defeats you.&quot;

&quot;Hmph,&quot; Shiho frowned.

&quot;Hello, everyone,&quot; Alyssa Searrs smiled as she drank a
cup of coffee, Miyu following her in with a tray of
similar drinks and a bag of donuts, &quot;we&#39;re back.&quot;

Just after them a tall, black haired woman strode in,
and despite her glasses she bore a remarkable
resemblance to Natsuki. &quot;Hello, Natsuki,&quot; she smiled.

&quot;Mother...&quot; Natsuki sighed. She looked down at her
script, &quot;This is very strange.&quot;

Ms. Saeko Kuga smiled wryly, &quot;I suppose so,
considering I survived in the manga but died in the
anime.&quot;

&quot;I think I prefer the anime,&quot; Alyssa muttered.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Nao drawled, &quot;you get Miyu for sex and a
mother to look after you.&quot;

Miyu materialized her sword in a instant as she coldly
commanded, &quot;Do not speak to Alyssa that way.&quot;

&quot;Break it up,&quot; Midori commanded as she summoned her
element, &quot;the leader of the anti-Orphan squad commands
it.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re cute when you&#39;re commanding,&quot; Yoko smirked.

&quot;Don&#39;t start,&quot; Midori blushed.

&quot;Alyssa,&quot; Saeko smiled as she petted her daughter&#39;s
head. Looked up at Natsuki she grinned, &quot;Give your
momma a hug.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t push it,&quot; Natsuki made a face.

&quot;Miss Kuga,&quot; Shizuru said respectfully.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Saeko looked at her curiously.

Shizuru knelt as she formally said, &quot;Ma&#39;am, I would
like your permission to take Natsuki as my wedded
wife.&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot; Saeko smiled back, clearly pleased by the
idea. And as a bonus they could have a double wedding
with Alyssa and Miyu, too.

&quot;Wha...&quot; Natsuki blurted. &quot;Don&#39;t I get any say in
this?&quot; she demanded. Not that she objected, of course,
but she wanted a say.

&quot;No,&quot; both Shizuru and Seako smiled at her sweetly.

&quot;I still can&#39;t get over my part,&quot; Takeda groaned, the
black haired young man putting his head in his hands.

&quot;You&#39;re in there other than as comic relief?&quot; Mai
sounded surprised as she continued, &quot;I hadn&#39;t got that
far yet.&quot;

Nao smirked, &quot;He&#39;s my new key.&quot;

&quot;How the...&quot; Yukino looked startled, &quot;I thought he was
focused on Natsuki?&quot;

&quot;The fires of youth defeated me,&quot; Takeda whimpered.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Mai blinked.

Nao cupped her breasts with both hands, &quot;One flash of
these puppies and he was mine!&quot;

Natsuki blinked, &quot;I don&#39;t know why, but somehow I feel
slighted.&quot;

&quot;Hey, you didn&#39;t want him,&quot; Nao shrugged.

&quot;Still, for him to fall for someone like you...&quot;
Natsuki shook her head.

&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; Nao glared.

&quot;And there they go again,&quot; Haruka shook her head.

Yukino patted her arm comfortingly, &quot;Don&#39;t let it get
to you.&quot;

&quot;So who gets to play the two Queens?&quot; Tate wondered as
he munched on a donut.

&quot;They really should hire new actresses,&quot; Mai sighed,
&quot;but knowing how cheap they are they&#39;ll probably just
dress up two Otome.&quot;

&quot;Too bad we appear in later scenes,&quot; Chie noted,
&quot;you&#39;d make a wonderful Marie Antoinette.&quot;

Aoi blushed charmingly, &quot;Oh Chie.&quot;

&quot;If you two start that up again,&quot; Natsuki growled,
&quot;get a room.&quot;

Shiho brightened a bit as she read, &quot;At least I still
have a chance with big brother at the end of the
manga.&quot;

&quot;Oh god,&quot; Tate whimpered softly.

Shiho&#39;s eyes widened and glittered with unshed tears
as she asked, &quot;Big brother doesn&#39;t want to be with
me...?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant,&quot; Tate said weakly.

&quot;He is so whipped,&quot; Nao smirked.

&quot;Takumi!&quot; Akira whimpered as she emerged in a girl&#39;s
uniform, &quot;do I have to wear this?&quot;

Takumi Tohkia sighed, &quot;It&#39;s that or star in another
one of the girl&#39;s yaoi mangas.&quot;

&quot;There are yaoi mangas on them?&quot; Aoi looked
interested.

&quot;NO perverted fantasies about my brother, please,&quot; Mai
said firmly.

&quot;Aww, Mai!&quot; Aoi pouted.

&quot;Oh my, so cute!&quot; Mikoto exclaimed. &quot;Mai, can I have
one of Mashiro&#39;s white rabbits?&quot;

&quot;Depends on if Disney sues us for the blatant Alice in
Wonderland rip off,&quot; Mai said as she looked over the
script.

&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Aoi noted, &quot;I thought Mashiro was in
part Fumi&#39;s Childe? How can she have her own Childe
and powers in the manga?&quot;

&quot;No one was comparing notes between the two
productions?&quot; Nao yawned.

Aoi nodded, &quot;Probably.&quot;

&quot;I vote we just refuse to do it,&quot; Natsuki said,
wincing at several of the upcoming Mai/Tate/Natsuki
scenes.

&quot;We have to, or they&#39;ll just use your older Otome body
double,&quot; Tate noted, &quot;like that damn scab Sergei.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no way Kruger could pass for me!&quot; Natsuki
protested.

&quot;And,&quot; Nao noted, &quot;I bet her Shizuru would find her
dressing in a school uniform hot.&quot;

&quot;I know I do,&quot; Shizuru noted dreamily.

&quot;Shizuru!&quot; Natsuki blushed.

&quot;Doing a little schoolgirl cosplay on the side?&quot; Mai
smirked, &quot;Junior Natsuki and upper-classman Shizuru,
maybe?&quot;

&quot;None of your business,&quot; Natsuki said, blushing
furiously.

End

Notes: A mix of my impressions from volume three to
five of the Hime Manga. I didn&#39;t go through scene by
scene because it would take WAY too long, but I at
least wanted to touch on a few interesting points. As
it is I&#39;m kinda tempted to write a Natsuki/Shizuru fic
following the manga in some way...</pre>
