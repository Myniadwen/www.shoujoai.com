<p>Within Her, Without Her</p><hr><i>Hey there, I guess.
This is my first time keeping a journal, so I don’t really know how
it all normally goes. Gah, I kind of feel like I’m talking to
myself here; I need to try something else. Okay, how about this? I’ll
just pretend I’m saying this all to Shizuru. She’s probably going
to end up finding this and reading it at some point anyways, no
matter how well I try to hide it, so it makes some sort of sense.</i><p><i>Alright, then.
Shizuru! Shame on you for reading my journal without my permission! I
demand you put this away and submit yourself to me for “punishment”
immediately. What are you doing still reading this? You couldn’t be
afraid of what I might do to you, could you? You do realize I put
“punishment” in quotes up there, right? That means that since I
was expecting you to do this, you’re acting just like the Fujino
Shizuru I’ve grown to love, and I feel like showing my love to you.
Aha, there we go, that got you.</i></p><p><i>I really do love
you, Shizuru. It feels so good to finally be able to say that. And
what we did last night, too, I have to say that I enjoyed that a lot
as well. I liked seeing the great Fujino Shizuru with all her
barriers broken down and surrendering herself completely to me. I
liked having you completely at my mercy, responding to my every
touch. And I loved bringing you to the heights of pleasure. I’d
really like to do that again sometime, and I’m not sure I can wait
until Friday. I guess I don’t really have to, though. After all,
Friday is just when you were going to return the favor for me.
Nothing says I can’t give you another favor in the meantime.</i></p><p><i>I wish you were 
here
right now, Shizuru. I’m bored out of my mind, to be honest. That’s
why I started writing this in the first place; it’s something to do
to pass the time. Heh, interesting how quickly my thoughts drifted
back to you. I really am in love, aren’t I? Thank you so much,
Shizuru, for letting me feel this. I wish I could just spend the rest
of the day doing nothing but being in love. Maybe if you were around,
I could. Why did you have to leave again? It seems like we both took
it for granted that you’d have to go home at some point today,
though I’m having my doubts.</i></p><p><i>Okay, now I’m
scaring myself. We’ve been a couple for less than one day, and I’m
already thinking about us moving in together. Let’s worry about
that later, okay? For now, let’s just spend as much time together
as we can. I’ll call you up as soon as I get home from school
tomorrow, and maybe we can do something then. I guess, maybe like a
date or something… Wait a second, did I just have sex for my first
time before my first date? Er, kinda. Half of sex, I guess… Okay,
we’re definitely going on a date before we do this again!</i></p><p><i>And now I’m all
nervous about our first date. Damn it, why do I keep doing this to
myself? And when you’re not around to enjoy my frustration and
blushes at that? Maybe I’m just mentally compensating for the lack
of you being here doing that to me. Wait, that’s worse, it means I
actually like it when you do that to me… Okay, now I’m hoping you
really don’t find this, or you </i><i><u>will</u></i><i> be
punished. Stop laughing at that!</i></p><p><i>Okay, I’m going to
stop writing now before I say anything even more embarrassing. I’ll
surf the internet for the rest of the evening or something.</i></p><hr><i>Why does this keep
happening to me? Is there some great cosmic law that Natsuki must get
tied up at least once a month?</i><p>Natsuki tried to count
the times this had happened to her as she waited for her captor to
make an appearance and explain this one. First, there was the
lingerie-stealing Orphan, which had already embarrassed her more than
enough, though fortunately it didn’t take long for her to be freed
from its grasp.</p><p>After that, it was two
separate occasions by Nao, the first to lure out Mai, the second
Shizuru. She’d been stuck there a lot longer than those times, and
the fact that she’d just learned of her mother’s betrayal of her
and couldn’t summon Duran just made things worse. She was
practically catatonic by the time Shizuru had freed her both of those
times.</p><p>How ironic then that
her next experience with bondage was at Shizuru’s own hands. When
the chain of Shizuru’s Element had broken through the bell that had
fallen on her, it had constricted painfully around her. The shocking
reminder of her previous experiences had left her stunned, even when
Shizuru had released her and pulled her into an embrace.</p><p>She’d regained her
senses in that hug, though. It was odd; she’d realized recently
that she really enjoyed hugs, after all she’d recently shared with
Shizuru. And yet being bound like this was quite a different matter,
even though there was a similarity in the physical sensations. What
was the difference, then? Was it the human contact in the hugs that
made the difference? No, she’d never cared about that. Unless… it
had been Shizuru every time recently, so maybe it was the contact
with her.</p><p>As if on cue, Shizuru
walked through the door to Natsuki’s room at this moment. Seeing
Natsuki tied down to her bed, Shizuru paused and raised an eyebrow.
“Ara ara, what has Natsuki gotten herself into now?”</p><p>“Shizuru!” Natsuki
said. Her arms instinctively tried to move out towards the girl, but
the restraints on her wrists held them back. “I don’t know, I
just woke up, and I was tied down to my bed. Could you just untie me
please, Shizuru?”</p><p>“Ara, now why would I
want to do that?” Shizuru said. As she approached Natsuki, she was
able to catch a devious glint in her eyes. She reached Natsuki’s
bed and bent over it, placing one hand on each side of her head as
she moved her face down to mere inches away from Natsuki’s. “I
finally have Natsuki right where I want her.”</p><p>“Heh, not funny,
Shizuru. Now please get me out, okay?” Natsuki begged. She was
desperately hoping this was all just a joke on the other girl’s
part. If it was, she was quite willing to beg her way out of it if
need be. Revenge could wait until later. Now, she needed to be free.
The restraints were starting to drive her crazy.</p><p>Unfortunately, Shizuru
seemed to have already reached “crazy,” and she was going for
“evil” now. “But this way Natsuki can’t stop me from doing
whatever I want with her body. She did that to me a couple nights
ago, it’s only fair. And forgive me, but Natsuki is just too
irresistible for me to be able to wait until Friday.”</p><p>In any other position,
Natsuki would have simply blushed at Shizuru’s words, but now, they
just made her afraid. She desperately jerked her arms against her
bonds in an attempt to get free, but it was to no avail. She felt
tears starting to leak from her eyes, and she hoped Shizuru would
recognize her pain and call off her plans. “Shizuru, please…”
she said, her voice starting to crack.</p><p>“Alright,” Shizuru
said, though her tone of voice did nothing to ease Natsuki’s fears.
“I won’t keep Natsuki waiting for my touch any longer.” With
this she brought her face down to touch her lips against Natsuki’s.
Her lips started to move against Natsuki’s, though Natsuki
steadfastly kept her own lips stiff to tell Shizuru that she was
serious about this.</p><p>Eventually, Shizuru
gave up on their kiss, but she didn’t give up on trying to arouse
Natsuki. Her lips drifted to Natsuki’s neck, trying to provoke a
reaction in the girl from contact there. Given a chance to speak,
Natsuki pled once more, “Please, Shizuru, not like this. I want
you, but not this way… please…” Natsuki broke into sobs as she
trailed off, and Shizuru fortunately seemed to give up on her neck.</p><p>“Alright then,”
Shizuru said, backing off from Natsuki. Her voice was dejected, but
Natsuki wasn’t in a position to care about the other girl’s
feelings. Natsuki felt the restraints on her arms and legs disappear,
but she didn’t wait to ponder the implications of this. She
immediately brought her arms up to wrap around Shizuru, pulling the
girl back into her.</p><p>As Natsuki sobbed into
Shizuru’s shoulder, the other girl’s arms slowly circled around
to return the hug. At this point, the fact that Shizuru was the one
who’d tortured her so didn’t matter to Natsuki. She needed the
comfort that only her girlfriend could provide, even if she was the
one who had made it necessary in the first place. “Please don’t
scare me like that again, Shizuru,” she said.</p><p>“Please don’t make
me, Natsuki,” Shizuru told her. Her voice had taken on a depressed
tone, and her body had started trembling as she said this. “I
really don’t like hurting you like that.”</p><p>Natsuki started moving
her hands to stroke along Shizuru’s back. She didn’t know what
had brought about the change in the girl’s mood, but it was
certainly preferable to her wanting to keep Natsuki tied up. “Then
why’d you do it, Shizuru?” Natsuki asked. Part of her wanted to
just comfort her hurt friend, but she needed to know what was going
on before she could relax enough to do that.</p><p>“Because you dreamed
that I’d do it, Natsuki. I don’t know why, but that thought
crossed your mind, and something in you brought it out so you could
work through it here.” Shizuru’s body had stopped trembling, but
her voice still seemed strained. “I wish you could just dream of
happier things, Natsuki. I’d love to take part in those dreams.”</p><p><i>Okay, this is
definitely one confusing dream. Since when are my dreams self-aware,
anyways?</i> Natsuki gripped her arms onto Shizuru as she rolled onto
her side. In this new position, she was able to back herself off a
bit to look into the girl’s face. “Who are you, really?” she
asked, looking into the other girl’s eyes to try to figure her out.</p><p>Shizuru quirked a 
smile
at this. “Ara? Don’t you recognize your girlfriend, Natsuki?”</p><p>“That’s not what I
mean, Shizuru!” Natsuki said. She really should have seen that one
coming. With a mental sigh, she continued. “I know you look like
Shizuru, but you’re here in my dreams, and you seem more aware than
any simple dream. Maybe I should have asked, ‘What are you?’”</p><p>“Ah,” Shizuru said.
Her smile turned from mischievous to knowing in a heartbeat. Natsuki
briefly wondered whether Shizuru actually used a greater array of
smiles when around her, or whether she was just able to tell them all
apart better than anyone else. Shizuru continued talking though, and
her train of thought was derailed. “Well, I can answer that one.
Over the last few days, you accepted your love for Shizuru, and you
let her into your heart. I’m that little piece of her that you let
in.”</p><p>“Right…” Natsuki
said. “I’ll just have to trust you on that. So what are you doing
in my mind anyways?”</p><p>“Oh, this and that,”
Shizuru said, winking in acknowledgment of her double entendre. “I’m
still trying to find my way around, really, but I think I rather like
it here. At least, when you don’t make me play a role in your
nightmares like this.” Shizuru gave her a pathetic expression at
this.</p><p>“Sorry about that.”
Natsuki apologized before she could catch herself. It seemed a bit
odd for her to be the one apologizing, but she could never resist
that expression on Shizuru’s face. “But why am I having this
nightmare anyways?”</p><p>“I think this is your
mind’s way of telling you you’re afraid, and maybe trying to help
you get over it,” Shizuru said. Her expression softened into a
sweet, loving gaze. She gave the impression with it that it was
always there for Natsuki, and she just had to drop her mask to let it
show through. She brought a hand up to cradle Natsuki’s cheek. “You
don’t have to be afraid of me, Natsuki. I’d never do something
like this unless I knew you wanted it.”</p><p>Natsuki gave a slight
nod at this. She brought up a hand of her own
to hold Shizuru’s hand against
her face. “But you want it, don’t you?” Shizuru gave a small
nod, and a hint of sadness slipped into her eyes. “I think that’s
the problem. I’m afraid that I won’t be able to give you
everything you want.”</p><p>Natsuki could see a
tear start to pool in Shizuru’s eye at this. When she spoke, her
voice had softened, and love seemed to lace every word. “I’ve had
so many fantasies about you, Natsuki. I don’t think it would be
humanly possible to fill them all. But by far the biggest one, the
only one that really matters, was simply having you love me back. I
have that now, and it’s already more than I deserve.”</p><p>Natsuki shook her head.
“Don’t play the martyr here, Shizuru. I love you, and I want to
be able to give you as much as possible. I don’t care if it’s
more than you think you deserve; you’re getting it anyways.”</p><p>“Natsuki is too
sweet,” Shizuru said, a hint of a blush rising to her cheeks. “But
you’re still afraid, aren’t you?” Natsuki gave a weak nod.
There was no point trying to lie and act strong here. “That’s
okay. I can try to help you with that. I’m not sure what all I can
do, but I’ll have plenty of time to fool around here in your brain
and figure something out.”</p><p>Shizuru started moving
her hand against Natsuki’s cheek, lightly stroking it. Natsuki
removed her hand from its grasp to allow her more freedom, and she
brought it over to Shizuru’s cheek to return the favor. “Thank
you, Shizuru.”</p><p>Shizuru spent another
moment stroking Natsuki’s cheek, before she moved her hand to
Natsuki’s shoulder. “You can ask the real Shizuru for help, too,
you know. I’m sure she’ll be just as willing to help you out as I
am. She can even do a better job than me of proving that you have
nothing to fear.”</p><p>“Yeah, but if I go to
her, she’ll tease me mercilessly about it,” Natsuki said. She
crossed her arms as best as she could in her position, trying to look
annoyed.</p><p>Judging by Shizuru’s
expression, Natsuki came across more as simply cute to her. “Now
come on, when have I ever teased you about the serious subjects?”
Shizuru scolded, removing her hand from Natsuki’s shoulder so she
could give it a playful slap. “I’ve always been quite sensitive
to that.” She leaned forward, bringing her face to within an inch
of Natsuki’s. A mischievous glint appeared in her eyes, causing a
pang of dread in Natsuki’s heart. “Besides, I know what goes on
in your mind. You don’t mind it nearly as much as you let on.”</p><p>A blush ran up to
Natsuki’s face at hearing this. “Oi! I do too mind it!”</p><p>“Oh really?”
Shizuru said. “Then how come whenever I tease you, there’s the
same little flutter in your heart that you get when you think about
how I love you?”</p><p>Natsuki rolled over
onto her back out of spite. “Baka! I was wrong; Dream Shizuru is
just as bad as the real thing.”</p><p>“You should just be
glad I’m not worse, seeing as I’m the one who’s sure you
secretly like it.” Shizuru’s voice had taken on a lustful tone.
Apparently Natsuki’s prior guess that she found Natsuki’s
discomfort and blushing somehow sexy was right on the money.</p><p>Natsuki rolled onto her
other side out of further spite, leaving her back facing Shizuru. She
couldn’t think of anything clever to say in response, so she
settled on an annoyed grunt. Of course, she realized a second too
late that it was just this type of reaction that Shizuru was always
trying to evoke from her. She started to mentally chastise herself
for falling for it, but a thought struck her that held her back. If
this was something Shizuru liked to see, maybe letting herself fall
for it would be like a favor for her. <i>Yeah, that should be a good
enough excuse for constantly falling for her traps. I’ll just
assume I’m subconsciously doing it to please her.</i></p><p>It wasn’t long before
Natsuki felt Shizuru start to lightly stroke her back, a move she’d
expected to be coming and now quite welcomed. Shizuru had apparently
had enough of teasing now, and was just taking the moment to caress
her girlfriend. Natsuki allowed herself to relax a little, no longer
on her guard for further taunts. “Why do you think I’m so scared,
Shizuru?” she found herself saying.</p><p>“Ara, I would have
thought Natsuki would know quite well why she doesn’t like being
tied up,” Shizuru said. Her hand continued its caresses, now
lightly stroking its way down Natsuki’s spine and sending shivers
through her body.</p><p>“Not just that,”
Natsuki said. She felt like she should have been uncomfortable
bringing this up, but the fact that she knew
this was a dream seemed to allay her fears about talking about
these things. “Even just… doing it… normally.” It didn’t do
so much for her modesty, apparently.</p><p>“Ah, I see,”
Shizuru said. She was silent for a couple minutes more, and her hand
stopped its motions as she thought. Eventually, it started moving
again and she spoke. “To be honest, Natsuki, I thought it would be
a lot harder for you than it was to open your heart up to me. But you
did it, and it seems like you weren’t even afraid of doing so. I
think, maybe you naturally would have been afraid, but you pushed the
fear away for my sake. This aspect of opening yourself up to me is
just where it ended up.”</p><p>Natsuki thought about
this for a bit. It made a certain amount of sense. She always had had
trouble letting people into her heart in the past. After her mother’s
death and the departure of her father, she’d been afraid to get
close to anyone. She’d acted that way towards Shizuru for quite
some time, and it was only in this past week that she’d put aside
that fear completely. So maybe whatever part of her mind it was that
made her afraid was now making up for lost time. It could be true,
but it still didn’t help her get over the fear. “Yeah, maybe,
Shizuru. Even knowing that, I’m still afraid, though.”</p><p>Shizuru’s hand
disappeared from her back, and Natsuki wondered what was going on
until she felt Shizuru move on the bed to press up against her back.
One arm wrapped over her, while another squeezed its way under her so
she could grip Natsuki in a hug. Her head came up to rest on
Natsuki’s shoulder and she said, “That’s alright, Natsuki.
There’s nothing wrong with being afraid. But we can push our way
through this together your first time, and after that it should get
easier.”</p><p>Natsuki twisted her
body around so she could face Shizuru, the other girl’s arms
relaxing temporarily to allow her to do so. “Are you sure you don’t
mind if I’m afraid?” she said. “You seemed to really like me
being courageous.”</p><p>Shizuru gave Natsuki a
smile which seemed to be half mischievous and half loving, but was
oddly comforting. “That was when you were in control,” she said.
“It’ll be a quite different experience for both of us when it’s
my turn to pleasure you, and your courage will be a lot less
necessary.”</p><p><i>Of course.</i>

Natsuki returned Shizuru’s smile to thank her for all the
reassurance. “You’re just as sweet as the real Shizuru, you
know,” she said. As soon as she saw the blush form on the other
girl’s face, she moved her head in to catch her in a kiss.</p><p>Shizuru was caught
off-guard by her kiss, but it only took a moment for her to get into
it. She started slowly moving her lips back against Natsuki’s. The
sensations Natsuki was experiencing were certainly enjoyable, but she
couldn’t help wishing it were the real Shizuru she was kissing. But
surely this wouldn’t count as cheating on her or anything, so
Natsuki allowed herself to enjoy the kiss as much as she could. She
tentatively brought her tongue out, prodding Shizuru’s lips…</p><p>…and a piercing noise
tore the world away from around her. Natsuki’s eyes snapped open to
find the culprit, her alarm clock, staring at her with what had to be
malice for it to take her away from such a moment. She brought her
arm over and slammed it to shut it up, mildly disappointed that she
didn’t manage to break it. <i>Damn it. Just when it was getting
good, too…</i></p><hr>The first half of
Natsuki’s school day seemed to drag on forever. She had Geometry in
the morning, as it was the class she ended up missing the most, being
both the first class in the morning her previous year and the subject
she was best at and felt she needed to attend least. Unfortunately,
the fact that she’d aced all the tests and assignments didn’t
make up for the fact that she’d attended less than a third of the
classes in the administration’s mind, so she was now forced to sit
through interminable lectures on all the laws and theorems she’d
already committed to memory.<p>This left her mind with
plenty of time to wander, while her ears were set to alert her in
case anyone said the words, “assignment,” “test,” “quiz,”
“Natsuki,” or “Kuga.” Mostly her mind wandered over the state
of her relationship with Shizuru, seeming to alternate between
remembering the events two nights ago with embarrassment and
anticipating those to come in four days with fear. When she started
to worry that her constant blushes were drawing looks from other kids
in class – a group mostly made up of delinquents who didn’t at
least have the excuse of trying to avenge their dead mothers and thus
grated on Natsuki’s nerves more than a little – she decided she’d
best redirect the focus of her thoughts lest one of them get ideas.
She didn’t know exactly what ideas one of them might get, but given
the crowd, it was a safe bet they wouldn’t be good.</p><p>Natsuki tried to
concentrate on what seemed to be a relatively safe subject: what she
was going to do with her free time after school. Up until the end of
the Carnival, she’d spent almost all of her free time either
fighting Orphans, trying to track down other HiMEs, or searching for
information on her mother. Now that all of those issues had been
resolved – however much she might have wished it weren’t the case
given the truth about her mother – she was left with the problem of
figuring how to actually have fun.</p><p>Shizuru had been a big
help with that over the past week. Even if she might occasionally be
embarrassed out of her mind, time spent with Shizuru was never
boring. But she couldn’t be around her every minute of her life
outside of school. They did have their different homes to go to after
all, and Natsuki was <i>not</i> going to let her mind drift to
possibly changing that situation. At least yet. It wasn’t as if she
was ruling it out in the future, after all…</p><p>Natsuki violently shook
her head, trying to rid her mind of the daunting prospect of living
with Shizuru. The boy sitting next to her gave her an odd look at
this, but her patented glare made him suddenly find his notes to be
the most interesting thing in the world. With a grunt, Natsuki went
back to her thoughts, taking care to avoid that particular subject.
Getting together with Shizuru after school was still an option,
though she’d need to think of things to do with her. Dinner some
day was a given, as she needed to make sure she got her first date
out of the way before her first time… doing that thing which would
make her blush just figuring out a name for it.</p><p>“…quiz at the end
of class this Friday, so be sure to study,” Natsuki’s ears caught
from the professor, snapping her out of her thoughts. A chorus of
groans passed through the room, though Natsuki didn’t join in. She
already knew this all, so she had nothing to fear from a quiz. She
probably wouldn’t even bother studying for it.</p><p>Natsuki had to suppress
a giggle as the thought of studying somehow brought up an image of
her being tutored by Shizuru, dressed in her old Kaichou uniform and
relishing her role as Natsuki’s teacher. That might actually be
enjoyable, and it could be worth bringing up if she couldn’t think
of anything else she could do with Shizuru. Okay, so if she included
a dinner date and whatever Shizuru was planning for Friday, that was
three out of five days for the coming week accounted for. It still
wouldn’t occupy all her time, but she’d probably have homework to
help fill in, and she should probably get into an exercise routine to
keep in shape as well.</p><p>As Natsuki noticed the
kids around her leaving, she realized that this announcement must
have marked the end of class. A glance at the clock confirmed this,
so she proceeded to pack up her notebook, which she’d kept out just
to avoid questions, and left to get some lunch before her afternoon
class. She was much too lazy in the morning to be able to force
herself to make a second meal and pack it up for lunch, so she was
left with only the option of the campus cafeteria – which was
notably reluctant to supply her with more than a couple packets of
mayonnaise for lunch. Nevertheless, she was able to choke down the
virtually mayonnaise-less food, and she headed off for her afternoon
class: English.</p><p>Although she didn’t
have any particular problems with learning the language, the nature
of the learning process was such that it was a lot harder to get by
missing classes. English class had been during the middle of her day,
so she didn’t miss it that often, but the effect of what she did
miss still piled up, and she’d ended up failing the final exam.
Even if Sakomizu had bothered to try to cover up for her absences,
much as Midori had thankfully done, her poor performance would have
required her to repeat the course nonetheless.</p><p>The upside to all this
was that the class was actually mildly interesting, and she didn’t
have to occupy herself with her thoughts during it. It didn’t
exactly pass quickly, but it did pass, and without much dull time for
idle thoughts or potential embarrassment as her thoughts went to
places they really shouldn’t have been going at school. Eventually,
it was all over, and Natsuki was free to make her way back to her
dorm.</p><p>As she was walking,
Natsuki felt a pang of regret. It took her a while to place it, but
eventually she realized that this was the first time she’d gone
home from school by a means other than riding her bike that she could
remember. Riding was always a calming experience for her, and it was
the perfect way to unwind after a day at school. Maybe she’d have
to go out and just joyride a bit later.</p><p>It didn’t take long
for Natsuki to reach her room. At least she had the short journey to
make up for not getting to ride her bike. As she unlocked and opened
the door to her room, she casually tossed her backpack aside and let
out a sigh of relief. Her first day of summer school was over. Only
three months to go.</p><p>No sooner had she
relaxed then was she assaulted from behind. Arms rapidly wrapped
around her to secure her in place, and Natsuki went into a state of
panic at the thought that her apartment had been invaded. Was it
Searrs or the First District out for revenge? She briefly struggled,
but stopped when the body behind her moved up to press against hers.
It took a mere sentence for her mind to judge the exact shape of the
body she was held against and place it.</p><p>“Damn it, Shizuru!”
she said, trying to suppress the blush that was rushing to her face
and failing miserably. “I thought I was under attack there. Can’t
I even feel safe in my own room?”</p><p>Natsuki felt Shizuru
pull her closer in, and her arms drifted up somewhat, pressing
uncomfortably against the undersides of her breasts. Well, not <i>that</i>

uncomfortably… Shizuru’s head came in to rest on Natsuki’s
shoulder, and she could smell Shizuru’s perfume as it was wafted
around to her nose. It only took a couple of seconds for her to
completely relax in the girl’s embrace.</p><p>“Ara?” Shizuru said
softly with a hint of mischievousness. “I thought Natsuki said she
wouldn’t complain about my surprise hugs if I didn’t hold it over
her head that I knew she liked them.”</p><p>Natsuki wanted to
complain and argue back, but she just didn’t have the heart at the
moment. Shizuru’s embrace was causing a dull aching need to rise in
her chest, and she felt her thought processes becoming just a bit
hazy. “I’m sorry, Shizuru,” she said. She felt some of
Shizuru’s muscles tense slightly at this, possibly from surprise at
her soft tone and apology. “I just wasn’t expecting you to be in
my apartment. How’d you get in here anyways?”</p><p>Shizuru’s body seemed
to relax again, and Natsuki let herself melt into the hug. She
brought her own arms up to cover Shizuru’s as the girl answered
her, “Intranet access privileges aren’t the only perks to being
Kaichou. They also gave me a few master keys, and I made sure to make
myself some copies for emergency situations before turning them in. I
think giving Natsuki a hug after she’s been waiting all day to see
me counts as an emergency, don’t you?” The blush had almost faded
from Natsuki’s cheeks by this point, but this comment brought it
right back. “And I was in desperate need of seeing some Natsuki
blushes myself,” Shizuru added teasingly.</p><p>“Shizuru…”
Natsuki said. She wasn’t able to force any actual annoyance into
her voice at this point. Right now, she just felt touched that
Shizuru would think to surprise her like this. Nevertheless, she was
obligated to give that response at a minimum to her teasing. Knowing
Shizuru, she’d probably end up punishing her if she didn’t.</p><p>Natsuki spent another
couple minutes in Shizuru’s embrace, as the other girl started
rocking her gently. She was getting a little afraid she might start
to doze off if this lasted any longer, so she gently gripped onto
Shizuru’s hands and pulled them off of her. As soon as Shizuru’s
grip was loose enough, she spun and wrapped her arms around Shizuru’s
neck so she could gaze into her love’s beautiful crimson eyes.</p><p>Shizuru met this with a
pleased smile and her arms returned to their hold around Natsuki. Her
eyes gazed deeply into Natsuki’s, seeming as if they were delving
the depths of her soul. <i>Look as close as you want, Shizuru. It’s
all just love in here now, </i>Natsuki thought, trusting her lover to
pick up her intent. Sure enough, Shizuru seemed to figure this out
for herself, and her gaze relaxed a little as tears started to form
in her eyes. Natsuki let a smile split across her face at this,
pleased that her girlfriend was still willing to let out her emotions
in front of her.</p><p>“Thank you for
coming, Shizuru,” she said. “I did miss you.” She didn’t give
Shizuru a chance to reply to this as she moved her mouth in to
capture Shizuru’s in her own. A spark seemed to run across their
lips as they connected, and Natsuki reveled in the feeling of kissing
Shizuru once again. She didn’t think she’d ever be able to tire
of this feeling, however often they did it.</p><p>It took only a moment
for Shizuru to start to return the kiss. A wave of warmth shot its
way through Natsuki’s chest as she felt her passions being
returned, and she allowed her mind to slip further into the haze that
it had been lingering on the edge of since she first realized it was
Shizuru who had caught her.</p><p>Neither of them felt
the need to deepen the kiss, and Natsuki was perfectly satisfied with
just caressing Shizuru’s lips with hers and being caressed in turn.
It had only been a day, but she had still gone far too long without
this. On one level, she actually hoped it would always be this way,
so they could share sweet kisses like these every time they met each
other again. With this thought in her mind, she slowly pulled back
from the kiss and let her nose rest against Shizuru’s as she softly
said, “I love you, Shizuru.”</p><p>She could hear Shizuru
choke back a sob at hearing this. She really was letting her emotions
out now, and Natsuki felt another wave of warmth course through her
chest at the realization of what she was doing for her. “Natsuki…”
was all Shizuru said, but it translated in Natsuki’s mind as, “I
love you too.”</p><p>Natsuki moved her head
to the side and rested it on Shizuru’s shoulder, moving her arm
down around her shoulder and out of the way, as she contented herself
with hugging her girlfriend. Oh, how she loved this. She’d had so
many worries earlier that day and in her dreams the previous night,
but they all seemed to fade away in Shizuru’s presence. She knew
that she could trust her friend not to do anything that might push
her limits, however much she might want to herself.</p><p>But something about it
still struck her as a bit wrong. She didn’t want Shizuru to
have to hold herself back. She was still afraid of what might happen
between them if she didn’t, though.</p><p><i>No.</i> Natsuki
pushed those thoughts out of her head. In any case, they’d both
agreed not to go any further until Friday night so they could be free
to sleep with each other after whatever happened. There was no reason
for her to worry about all of that now. She might be afraid, but
she’d promised herself to Shizuru already, and there was no way
she’d let herself break that promise. That would be at least one
step towards letting Shizuru have all she wanted, and she wouldn’t
need to worry about any more until after that.</p><p>“Natsuki,” Shizuru
said after a bit. “I’d really love to keep hugging you, but I’m
afraid my legs are about to give out. I’ve been standing here
waiting for you for quite a while.”</p><p>Natsuki chuckled
lightly as she released her grip from Shizuru and backed off. “It’s
alright, you can sit down,” she said, making sure Shizuru caught
the smile on her face so she knew that she wasn’t mad.</p><p>Shizuru smiled back at
Natsuki and took a seat, leaning back to take the pressure off of her
legs. Natsuki felt an idea for what to do starting to form in her
mind, and she paced the room a little as she let it percolate and
take form. Once it struck her, she turned to Shizuru and said, “Hey,
Shizuru, would you like to go for a bike ride with me?”</p><p>The suggestion seemed
to surprise Shizuru. Before she could politely decline, Natsuki
explained her reasoning. “I mean, I was just thinking that it’s
something I really like to do, and it would be nice if I could share
that with you. Plus, it’ll allow you to hug me from behind and
still be sitting down. Er, I guess though, that maybe it’s a bit
selfish and I should be asking to do something you like first, but-”</p><p>“I’d love to,”
Shizuru said, cutting Natsuki off. Natsuki had let her gaze drift
from Shizuru as she started to ramble, and as she brought it back she
realized that the girl was actually blushing at this. <i>Score one,
Natsuki. </i>“I can teach you the fine arts of tea brewing later,
but this sounds like a good plan for today,” Shizuru added. An
excited smile had formed on her face, and Natsuki knew she was
serious about this and wasn’t just agreeing to please her.</p><p>Natsuki let a smile
light up her face, partly in joy at Shizuru’s agreement, and partly
because she was pleased that her idea of sharing what she loved with
Shizuru was received well. She rushed to her closet and took out her
helmet and biking leathers. She tossed the helmet over to Shizuru and
said, “Wear this. I’ll go carefully for today, and if you like
it, we can get you your own helmet and leathers later.” As soon as
she turned away to change into her leathers in her room, the thought
of a leather-clad Shizuru passed through her mind, causing a blush to
rapidly form on her face. <i>Damn it. Score one, Shizuru, without
even trying.</i></p>
