<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The name  Aoi’s father gives to a CPU—shi pi yu—should be read as a  Romanization of Japanese characters, with “i”s that sound like long “e”s. “yu” may be read as “Yoo.”</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ten  thousand yen is approximately a hundred U.S. dollars.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  reading this chapter, I guess you can probably figure out what I’m  majoring in at College. I hope it doesn’t read too much like a  manual.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Inoue  Nakahara thought that living in a field base was nowhere near as bad  as some of the more upper-crust brass claimed.  (And really, weren’t  they all upper-crust if you dug deep enough through layers of  bullshit?) At least she had a working shower which she shared with  nobody at all, and water which, while not hot, was at least lukewarm.  She knew the troops she had in the area were still forced to  essentially get naked together and dump buckets of cold water over  their heads if they wanted to appear clean, but she had reassured  them that she was doing her best to get them some hot water, anyway.  They had mostly ignored her. It mattered to them about as much as  knowing exactly what they ate every meal, or about the innocuous  little white powder that didn’t always mix in fully.  (The reason,  incidentally, that they were able to take those co-ed showers without  any incidents, and why a few of the women had discovered, much to  their chagrin, that they were starting to develop very fine hair  above their lips.)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Such was  life when one was in a private army.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Inoue  shut the water off and stood in the small aluminum niche for a  moment, letting what was left of the lukewarm feeling run down her  body—or at least, that had been the plan, until something started  buzzing in the office to which her shower was attached.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sighing,  she stepped out of the shower and wrapped a towel above her small  breasts, and hurried into the other room, feeling almost painfully  girly as she held the towel in place with one hand <em>(not like  anybody’s going to try anything anyway, most of these men haven’t  had a stiffy since they signed on, ha-ha) </em>and ran bare-footed,  doing her best not to drench any important papers. <em>(As if such a  thing truly existed.)</em> She grabbed the small cellular phone and  flipped it open, pressed it to her ear, and heard a voice she did not  expect but certainly did not object to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,  babe,” Shiratori Endo said, his voice deep and slightly ragged, a  product of age and experience <em>(and oh, what experience) </em>both.  “Catch you at a bad time?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  makes you say that?” Inoue said, turning away from the office  window that none of her soldiers were peeking in to, in spite of  several having passed it by.  She began to make her way back into the  bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usually  takes you maybe a ring and a half to answer; two if I catch you  during a good bowel movement.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Charming,  as always, Shiratori.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,  I don’t have to charm you anymore. I’m straight with my wife  now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bull  shit.” Inoue did not believe this because she had slept with  Shiratori Endo not three weeks ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well.  Mostly, and I’ve already got you down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  allure me with your wisdom and information, not your dignified  speech, and for that, you should be grateful. Am I to assume you’ve  got something fascinating for me, or have you just got your dick in  your hands?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now  who’s charming?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hm.  So do you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. Have any of the other men around your place got their dicks  in their hands?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Haven’t  in quite a while,” Inoue said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  still can’t believe you’d actually do that, Inoue,” Shiratori  said, his voice suddenly serious.  “That’s crossing the line from  efficient into…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Robots?  I think that’s the idea. When you’ve got a tiny little army  against the world, you do away with everything that doesn’t involve  planning and killing out of necessity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Everything,  huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, <em>I’m </em>not the one we’re worried about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  you have a set of tits instead of testicles.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In so  many words.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  a little sexist.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  a harsh world, isn’t it? Did you say you had something for me, or  did you just call to give yourself something to masturbate to when  your wife is around?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  always have something for you when I call.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Inoue  stayed silent, now back in the bathroom, her mouth pursed in a thin  smile which contained more humor than she gave it credit for.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  remember Minoru Alder?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  she said at once, because she didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure  you do, babe. You met him once at a party with me. Remember, the one  that the Kurosaki family threw back in ’96?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. I  was sloshed that night. That was the second time you got in my pants,  and that was how, after the first time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  wound me. I was nowhere near as bad as you remember.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  is because I can remember very little. Small favors.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,  are you all right?” Shiratori’s voice showed genuine concern.  “I  feel like tonight’s beating is a little more brutal than usual.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  ducky,” Inoue said. <em>Except that unless you’re about to tell me  that God himself has brought his fist down and smashed the living  fuckall out of the Swiss, I’m about to lose one hell of a lot of  men unless I can come up with a strategy to rival one of Sun Tsu’s. </em>“How are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  never tell me things anymore, babe. You know that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I <em>am </em>married, you know. And I love my husband very much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After a  pause, Shiratori said, “You know…if I thought you believed that  halfway as much as you wanted to, I don’t think I would keep doing  what we do, babe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Fuck  you. The last thing I need right now is a lecture about something  that already makes my stomach fucking jerk every time I goddamn think  about it.  Especially a lecture from somebody like </em>you.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Fuck  this. This, now, is the last thing I need. </em>And, pushing her  feelings back as she always had, Inoue Nakahara shook her head out,  water coming out in small showers, feeling a bit like a puppy for a  moment.  “Did you have something useful to tell me, Shiratori?”  Inoue said, “Or shall I hang up now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiratori  sounded…not hurt, but certainly melancholy.  “No,” he said. “I  have something for you. Right now, I’m waiting for a call from  Minoru Alder, the guy I just told you about. Right now he’s inside  the Swiss compound, and I think he’s going to blow the whole damn  thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>What?</em>” <em>Hand of God, man. </em>“How?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’ve  holed up in an old building, so the whole thing is wired through just  a pair of generators. Just one backup and one primary, and there’s  only like two circuit breakers, and one of them is only hooked up to  the primary. It’s set up so that if one blows, the other one will  kick in after a few seconds, and then if that one blows people are  really shit out of luck.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  the engineer here, Shiratori, not me.” Immediately, Inoue felt that  little irritating niggle in the back of her head. It was called  impatience.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  getting to it.  So, turns out he managed to scrounge up essentially a  thick chain and a thicker metal stake.  Both of them are made from  copper. I have no fucking idea what either of them are normally used  for, but it had to be something kinda fucked up, since he says he  found some blood stains on both of them. You know what happens when  you hook up a power source to ground?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You</em> do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Smoke.  You fry the fucking wire. Circuit breaker’s supposed to prevent  this, but it’s a matter of twenty minutes, some rubber gloves, and  a set of pliers to bypass it in an old building like that. You do  that to a whole building—hook a thick wire on the other side of the  building from the generator just…into the earth, even, and you have  a whole fucking building full of smoke and dead equipment, unless  you’re lucky as all hell and one of your wires was old enough that  it fried faster than the rest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can  he do that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Inoue,  when Minoru Alder sets his mind on something that he thinks will make  him feel even a year younger than he is, he can do just about  anything, or fucking die trying. Especially if I’m on the phone  coaching him through it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He’s  pretty old?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He  thinks he is. He can’t be more than forty five or fifty. He retired  a few years back. I guess somebody called him out of retirement.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He  wouldn’t say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Inoue  took a deep breath and sat down on the toilet seat.  “I don’t  trust this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  don’t have to. Call your boy over there back in an hour. If he  doesn’t pick up, Minoru’s done it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…You’re  serious about all this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dead  serious.” Something rang in the background. “Oh, shit. That’s  him. Gotta run, babe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Call  me and tell me what happens.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  will.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  didn’t tell each other that they loved each other when they hung  up. Inoue hoped he had to try as hard as she did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  love his childish ass. Shiratori is just…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Grown  up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Kenji  is an adult too, and a damned fine commander. And a dear friend.  And  he’s supportive and intelligent. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So  then what the hell do you need a lover for?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Inoue  felt that she had been trying to answer that question since she had  met Kenji.  The best she had been able to do was keep trying to  promise herself that she would stop.  That she would love <em>only </em>him. She thought that maybe she could take her job as her lover,  and it usually worked…for a while.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>This  time, I’m going to keep my promise to you, Kenji.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One  way or another, she would prove to herself that she loved him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No  matter what.</span></p>

Three  syllables.<br />
They  were starting to become clear now. There was a guard outside her  door, and he felt the three syllables treading on the edges of his  sanity, where he had previously thought only his wife dared to  meddle.<br />
Three  syllables.<br />
Not long  now.

When Aoi  Senou had been only eight years old, before her father started to  make money faster than he could spend it on<br />
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">(numb  broads)</span></em><br />
mistresses,  one of the things she had always enjoyed—for some reason  unfathomable to <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">both </span></em>parents—was watching her father build  computers.  This had been before his father had the money to blow on<br />
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">(straight  ticket outta here)</span></em><br />
booze,  so he had most always been lucid while he did it—grasping the  computer case with one end, he would deftly snap pieces into place  like a puzzle, his face lax with the sort of concentration usually  one usually saw in the very bright or the very stupid.  She would  always watch from the door to his little work room, never daring to  enter, though he must have known she was there, for he occasionally  sang to himself songs that she had enjoyed since she was very small.  He had always made it clear that she was not to touch his work, not  because he didn’t trust her, but because it was all very fragile.  Aoi had been too young to know the difference at that point in her  life, and so she had one day resolved to demonstrate to him just how  trustworthy she really was. She had watched him carefully for days,  observing closely the point at which he put a little square—what he  called the shi pi yu (the name had always made her giggle)—into a  little niche on a larger square and then gently lowered the lever,  taking care that nothing cracked.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">On this  one instance, she waited until he left the room to go relieve  himself—of his wife, of course, at a local bar—she hid in a hall  closet, and then, when she was quite certain he was out of sight, she  crept down the carpeted hallway of the distinctly western house her  family had inherited from her aunt, into the room, and began her  search for the CPU.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When she  found it, she made to grab it, but the instant her finger touched it,  an enormous spark leapt from her fingertips, numbing the upper part  of her hand and causing her to leap back in alarm, shrieking as the  smell of smoke filled her nostrils.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  then that her father had advanced into the room and sat down next to  her and sighed.  What he was doing there, she didn’t know, but it  became clear to her, thinking on it later, that he had <em>let </em>her  make that mistake. “That will cost me nearly ten thousand yen,”  he said, laying his hand on her shoulder.  She had begun to cry, more  out of fear of what the shi pi yu might do to her than what her  father might do to her.  He held her until she stopped, and then  smiled at her gently. “Looks as though I’ll have to wait until  another day for the bar, anyway. Shall we make a lesson out of it?”  he said.  He loved to make lessons out of things.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  nodded somberly, and he grinned at her and held the CPU up to the  light—she flinched from it, but he patted her reassuringly on the  head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whenever  I work with these things,” he said, “I make sure to hold on to  that metal case. That way all the static electricity I pick up from  shuffling up and down these halls with you goes away, right down into  the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did…I  break it?” she had asked timidly, and he nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Computers  are very delicate machines. They’re made out of tiny little wires  and even smaller little machines.  When you shocked the computer, all  of the wires got fried.”  He said the last word in English, a word  that she had always laughed delightedly at, and this time was no  exception, even through her childish terror.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Most  parents would have tried to make a life lesson out of the  incident—look before you leap, or some other nonsense—but not  Aoi’s father.  That day, he taught her something about computers  and electricity, and from that, she developed a curiosity which had  spanned all the way into high school.  He would have called that <em>good  parenting</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi  certainly did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  machines which hummed on the walls of their plastic-coated cell were  encased in a plastic coating as well, and now Aoi thought that she  knew why.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  plastic was cheap, though.  There were a lot of things about this  building that Aoi thought were cheap.  The small glass windows on the  plastic doors, for example. Glass that could be easily smashed by a  determined girl with an elbow wrapped in cloth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  cloth was easy. Aoi was wearing cloth.  Lots of it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Uttering  a brief prayer to a God that she believed in about half of the time,  Aoi asked that if a guard were to interrupt her, it would be once she  had her shirt back on. She removed her shirt with only the slightest  niggle of modesty—Mai, after all, was much better endowed than she  was, and so it was only normal, and besides, Mai was damned pretty.  She wore no bra, not because she was <em>far-out </em>like that but  because it had been burned when she had been captured (she had the  burn marks to prove it) and so when she made her way to the window,  wrapping the shirt around her elbow, she covered her<br />
      <em>(baby-feeders  they’re coming to eat me)<br />
        (don’t  you dare cry)</em><br />
  average  breasts with one hand, as much for protection as for modesty. Mai  watched all this with more fascination than she had displayed in  anything so far, and Aoi thought that if she told this to Chie, the  both of them might wind up having some very unwarranted thoughts  about the girl, who was, after all, very pretty. (Which was stupid,  since Mai was very thoroughly enamored with Yuuichi, and Aoi and Chie  were..)<br />
  <em>(don’t)</em><br />
  Without  thinking too much about it, Aoi raised the covered elbow to the small  window and smashed as hard as she could.  It splintered with an  almost icy <em>crack</em>, but did not shatter, and that was just fine  by her.  She switched the covering to her hand and pressed gently on  the glass, now covered by thin cracks like spiderwebs, and managed to  procure two very sharp, fairly large pieces of glass for her efforts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  are you doing?” Mai asked, her voice actually perking up, though  still hoarse.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something  I’ll need your help with,” Aoi said, putting her shirt back on as  she laid the two pieces of glass out in front of her.  “Come here  and give me a hand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai made  her way towards Aoi, looking almost decrepit as she did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take  this. Do you see the plastic seam there?” Aoi pointed towards a  spot on the nearest machine.  “Get to sawing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  stared at her. “That’s…stupid. We won’t be able to break  that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  need to,” Aoi smiled. “We just need a finger-sized hole is all.  Computers are delicate machines, after all.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Shizuru  screamed again.  Natsuki felt it again. This time Mai felt it too.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In fact,  it was safe to say that every single person who had killed and died  last year in that sick, awful carnival felt it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  felt it too.  He felt it hard.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
It spoke  to Natuski.  It said, <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Come and we’ll stop.</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And,  God help her, that was exactly what she realized she had to do. They  would kill Shizuru. Fucking kill her<br />
      <em>(like  you killed her)</em><br />
  and  she would die screaming like that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  first, she would have to get past this elevator, and the shot waiting  for her at the top.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  is your leg?” the man with the scratchy face asked, and, as though  prompted, her leg began to tingle. Like pins and needles it began to  tingle.  As though it had been simply asleep, and not like the muscle  had been cut.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>liar  liar pants on fire.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  side still hurt. She was still cut badly, but she could feel even  that healing as a new energy, like a second wind, seemed to pour into  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Still  the same,” Natsuki lied. “Can’t feel it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please,”  the man said with a smile which Natsuki had now determined was very  much forged. “You do not need to exaggerate your tolerance for pain  on my account. Just a little longer, though, don’t you worry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Scratch  scratch scratch.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do  you think I could get a new bandage for my side when we get up there,  too? Something to hold me together a little better than a soggy piece  of cloth?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If the  accountant was bothered by her suddenly-conversational tone, he  didn’t show it. “Of course,” he said.  “Planning on doing  some gymnastics later?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shrugged, forcing herself not to answer, reminding herself that she  was not yet <em>that</em> talented of a liar.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man  flipped open his little phone and muttered something into it. After  he flipped it closed, he said, “There will be a bandage waiting for  you when we reach the top.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kind  of a long way, isn’t it?” Natsuki asked carefully. “It must be  a slow elevator.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,”  the man shrugged. “The base was constructed in a hurry. State of  emergency and all that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where  are we, anyway?” The second after she said it, Natsuki cursed  herself an idiot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man  paused for a moment, and then said smoothly, “Afraid I can’t tell  you that either.  The Swiss are remarkably closed about such things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  elevator jerked to a halt, and then the man said, “Well, there we  are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The door  was halfway open when Natsuki moved her big toe, and then tensed the  muscles in her thigh, finding nothing to move nearly as slowly or  painfully as it should if she had just had a strand of muscle cut.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then  everything went to shit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The door  stopped halfway, and for a second, Natsuki wasn’t sure what was  going on, even as the lights began to break open—shatter, really.  Smoke began to pour from just about every little crack in every wall  in the building—electric smoke, with its own unique, acrid stench.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">People  began shouting.  A hand reached into the half-opened door holding two  things: A needle and a bandage.  The man with the scratchy face made  for both of them, but Natsuki moved faster, grabbing both with one  hand as she stood and shoved the chair backwards with the other.  The  heavy metal frame slammed into the man and air left him in a <em>woof,</em> and he staggered back, stunned for long enough that Natsuki had time  to uncap the needle and jam it into his neck.  He uttered a gasp that  told her that she had failed to piece his lung as she had been hoping  to do, but he went down fast enough anyway as the drugs from the  needle ate his consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Accountant,  huh,” she said with a backwards, dismissive look at him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  and your ilk will <em>burn </em>for your crimes,” he said, and then  he said something which made her gasp.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You,  and all of the other fucking <em>HiME</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  shock nearly floored Natsuki where all the drugs could not.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then a  gun poked its little muzzle into the gap in the doorway, and Natsuki  lashed out with her left hand and knocked it aside before it could  fire. Grabbing it, she glanced up briefly, spotted an emergency grate  in the ceiling of the elevator, and leapt up, knocking it out of  place and grabbing onto the ledge with a single, fluid motion.  Adrenaline filled her veins, and in a single moment, she felt as  energetic as she had during the carnival.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was a  strange, foreboding feeling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But it  was not wholly unpleasant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe  that should have disturbed her. But as she pulled herself up onto the  roof of the car, finding herself immersed in near total  darkness—whatever had killed the electricity had done it but good,  since not even the backup lights were on—she felt simply <em>alive.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hiding  on the roof, she tended to the wound that she had not felt herself  reopen with the bandage she had stolen. Nobody came up after  her—maybe they assumed she would be heading for higher ground. That  was fine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  wound wasn’t as bad as it had been before.</span></p>

Aoi and  Mai switched off with shards of glass.  In what Chie would have  called <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">true action-heroine style</span></em>, they used the glass to tear  small, modest pieces off of each of their outfits, rather than simply  murdering Aoi’s shirt and leaving her bare-breasted.  As such, they  had only enough cloth for one person, which wound up being just fine.  It was harder work than Aoi expected, but that came with an added  bonus: Given a focus for her considerable work ethic, Mai looked  better than she had in days, just sitting in front of the large  plastic protrusion, scraping gray slivers a nanometer’s depth off a  piece at a time until her wrist tired.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Between  the two of them, it took them half an hour and four shards of glass  to dig a finger-sized hole in the device.  In spite of the cloth  covering, both of them had blood on their hands and arms by the time  they finished—if not from tears in the cloth, then from shards of  glass that nicked them when what they were using shattered in their  hands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But a  finger was all they needed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi was  sure of it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  is probably going to hurt you,” Aoi said. “A lot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  shrugged the shrug of—and Aoi had no idea where this thought came  from, because it certainly wasn’t her experience talking—an old  soldier.  “Have you heard Shizuru screaming? I’m sure it’s  her—I can feel it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi had,  but she hadn’t known who it was. That Mai knew so readily gave Aoi  a sick feeling in her stomach.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">An ugly  little part of her, though, felt relief.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>At  least that’s not Chie.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  things going on here that I don’t know anything about,” Aoi said.  “And you’re going to tell me when I need to know, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  nodded somberly, not certain if she meant it or not.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  tell me this: Does it have something to do with what happened last  year at school?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  ugly little part of Aoi tried its best to put down the feeling of  embracing Mai tearfully before their train pulled out of the station  last year; the feeling of embracing somebody’s warmth for the last  time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  couldn’t quite do it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi  hugged Mai again, and Mai hugged back.  Her grip was strong now; her  task had rejuvenated her.  Or maybe it was just her sight that had  come back; she knew that what she needed was straight ahead, and once  she knew where she was going, she had the resolve to get there, or at  least go down hard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  stuck her finger into the little hole. There was a loud <em>crack</em> and instantly smoke began to billow from the hole, and Mai jerked  back almost immediately, clutching her finger, which had a nasty  purple spot on the tip that hadn’t been there a second before. She  stuck her finger in her mouth and cursed to herself, taking care not  to swear aloud.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This,  after all, was the easy part.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The hard  part would come when somebody came inside to figure out what the hell  had happened.</span></p>
