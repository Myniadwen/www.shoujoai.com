<h1>Proposal</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leebot.html">Leebot</a><br> </h2>
<p>Natsuki parked her bike
in the garage and made her way to the door. The last beam of sunlight
disappeared from the window as she walked, and she mentally grumbled
to herself. <i>Damn you, Fumi-temee. I’m supposed to be able to go
home when the kids do. Monitoring detention is even worse than
serving it, as I didn’t even do anything wrong. And yet I still get
stuck in there with nothing to do far too late.</i><p>As her fingers reached
the doorknob, Natsuki’s worries started to leave her. She was just
a door away from Shizuru, knowing her wife. The woman must usually
listen for the sounds of the garage door opening, and then run to the
doorway that connected the garage to the house every day, just so she
could embrace Natsuki the moment she stepped through. It was a bit
silly when Natsuki thought of all Shizuru must have had to do to pull
this off, but her silliest moments were some of her sweetest.</p><p><i>And I could really
use some of her silliness right now,</i> Natsuki thought as she
opened the door. She stepped through with her eyes blissfully closed
as she waited for Shizuru to pounce on her. She’d long ago given up
on trying to anticipate the direction of the woman’s attacks, so
leaving her eyes closed as she entered was a subtle gesture of
surrender. <i>Not that it isn’t fun surrendering myself to her from
time to time,</i> Natsuki thought with a chuckle. Shizuru could be
quite creative when Natsuki gave her full lease, and she never failed
to please.</p><p>But quite
frustratingly, Shizuru’s hugs weren’t coming now. Was she just
playing around to get Natsuki wanting it more? It couldn’t be a way
to punish her, as Natsuki had been sure to call ahead and warn her
she’d be held up at work. Hesitantly, Natsuki called out, “Shizuru?
You there?” No reply was forthcoming, so Natsuki hesitantly opened
her eyes, hoping Shizuru wouldn’t see her and “punish” her for
it.</p><p>As her eyes opened
fully, Natsuki was taken aback by the dim lighting. It wasn’t
simply that the lights were off that surprised her, but that a small
amount of illumination was being provided by a candle nearby. Down
the hallway, she could see a couple other candles set up. Shizuru was
trying to set a romantic mood, apparently, and she was definitely
succeeding. It wasn’t the setup itself that did it for Natsuki, but
the memories. This was exactly the way she’d up the house for
Shizuru on the day she’d proposed. It was one her happiest
memories, though she never could decide on a good ranking of that
night and some other very special moments with Shizuru.</p><p>With a sigh of relief,
Natsuki dropped her briefcase to the ground and rolled her shoulders
to try to loosen them out. Shizuru’s magic hands normally made
short work of her daily stresses, but it looked like she’d have to
do without for at least a few minutes today. Once she was loosened
up, she let her gaze drift down to the candle that was positioned
near the doorway, finding a handwritten note from Shizuru.</p><p>When Natsuki had set up
the house like this to propose to Shizuru, she’d left various
letters she’d written for Shizuru over their years together near
each of the candles. The first was the letter she’d written while
trying to figure out her feelings for Shizuru, which she’d slipped
into Shizuru’s bag as she was going home the morning after they’d
first made love. At each candle on the way to the bedroom, she’d
left a letter that she’d written and given to Shizuru a bit later
in their relationship.</p><p>The final candle, just
inside the doorway to their bedroom, had a new letter resting at its
base, where Natsuki explained all the thoughts that were going
through her mind when she finally made the decision to propose. The
position of it allowed her to watch from the bedroom as Shizuru read.
Her lover was in tears by the time she was finished reading, and
Natsuki took that moment to walk up to Shizuru and embrace her.</p><p>She allowed herself to
indulge in a passionate kiss for a couple minutes before she pulled
her face back so she could look into Shizuru’s eyes. The flickering
candlelight made Shizuru’s crimson eyes appear as if a fire were
burning within them, which Natsuki imagined as her passionate love.
It was with their eyes locked like that that Natsuki whispered a
question she was already positive of the answer to.</p><p>Natsuki shook herself
out of the memory as tears threatened to break out of her eyes.
There’d be plenty of time for tears later, whatever Shizuru was
planning, but she’d have to hold herself together a little longer.
With a steadying breath, she unfolded Shizuru’s note and started to
read it by the light of the nearby candle.</p><p><i>Ara, Natsuki, I’m
so sorry I asked Fumi-san to keep you after school today, but I
needed some time to set everything up just perfectly. You did the
same thing with my father when you proposed, so no complaining!
Though if you feel like being “punished” a little, you can feel
free to complain a bit later, and I’ll happily oblige.</i></p><p><i>As you’ve probably
guessed, I have something very special planned for tonight. If you
answer the way I think you will, judging by a couple things you’ve
told me, this night will be just as special as the one where you
proposed to me. I just wanted to take the chance to be on the other
side this time and give you the same romantic experience you gave me.</i></p><p><i>Your 
soul-mate,</i></p><p><i>Shizuru</i></p><p>What could Shizuru be
planning? What was there beyond marriage that she might be proposing?
It wasn’t their anniversary, so it couldn’t be a simple
celebration of that. Did Shizuru want to try something new sexually?
No, Shizuru had always brought up new suggestions in much less
elaborate circumstances, so it couldn’t be that either. Maybe a
renewal of their wedding vows? That was a bit more likely, given the
setup, but it seemed far too early in their marriage to think about
that.</p><p>With a sigh, Natsuki
resigned herself to remaining in the dark until Shizuru revealed her
plans. Placing the letter back on the stand by the candle, she
strolled to the next candle, just down the hallway, to see what
Shizuru might have left for her there. A small box lay on the stand
there, with a label on top that simply read, “Your delight.”</p><p>Quirking an eyebrow as
she wondered what the note might mean, Natsuki opened up the box.
Inside, she found a small bottle of mayonnaise, and Shizuru’s
meaning immediately became clear. Chuckling at her wife’s thought,
she picked the bottle up and squeezed out a dollop onto her finger.
She brought it to her mouth and licked it off, moaning in pleasure.
Just as she’d suspected, it was Shizuru’s special blend. She’d
somehow managed to mix in the flavor of tea leaves to mayonnaise, so
that Natsuki would always think of her when she tasted it. Shizuru
had never revealed the secret to making it, but she had always made
enough to keep Natsuki more than satisfied.</p><p>Natsuki wanted to stick
around and finish up the bottle, but Shizuru had browbeaten restraint
into her. She certainly wouldn’t be pleased to see Natsuki
forgetting about that now. For all she knew, it might even be some
sort of test. In that case, it would be a horribly bad idea to
consume even one more drop. There was no telling what punishment
Shizuru might enact. <i>Okay, maybe not </i>that<i> bad an idea,</i>

Natsuki thought with a blush creeping to her cheeks. <i>But it’ll
probably be better if I’m nice and obedient. She’s probably
looking for things to be sweet tonight. I can be naughty tomorrow.</i></p><p>Reluctantly 
leaving the
mayonnaise behind, Natsuki approached the next candle down the
hallway. Another box was set up below it, a bit larger than the last
one. The label on this one read, “Your Protector.” It wasn’t
any more enlightening than the previous box’s label was, so Natsuki
opened up the box to figure it out. She let out a squeal of delight
when the contents came into view. “Duran-chan!”</p><p>Natsuki quickly plucked
the stuffed blue puppy out of the box and nuzzled up against its soft
and adorable face. Shizuru had given it to her the same day she’d
first given Natsuki some of her special mayonnaise, and Natsuki had
reacted by bonding with it in much the same way. Shizuru had said it
was supposed to be something to protect Natsuki when she couldn’t
be around, but Natsuki had instead treated it as something she could
cuddle with in lieu of Shizuru.</p><p>Giving Duran-chan one
last hug and kiss, Natsuki carefully placed him back in the box –
not quite as squished up before, as he could poke his head out of the
top now – and walked over to the next candle. The label on the box
below this one immediately made Natsuki blush: “Your kink.” Her
mind immediately jumped to all of the kinky things Shizuru had pushed
her into – and the small number she’d pushed Shizuru into – and
tried to figure out which toy Shizuru might have put in the box for
her.</p><p>Eventually giving up at
guessing from the myriad possibilities – the though of just how
many possibilities making her blush even deeper – Natsuki opened up
the box. Her suspicions turned out to be right, as inside she found a
pair of silk handcuffs. The blush on her cheeks started to fade a
little as she recognized the pair and was touched by Shizuru’s
thought.</p><p>The pair of handcuffs
was the first that Natsuki had ever worn for Shizuru. These ones were
strictly for play; they didn’t use keys, so she’d always be able
to get them off of herself if she wanted to. She’d made much use of
that feature in getting over her fears at first, but Shizuru never
complained. Shizuru had even laid off on her usual teasing while they
were working on this. Even though by that point she’d figured out
that Natsuki secretly appreciated it, she knew it would have made her
a bit too uncomfortable at the time.</p><p>As Natsuki walked to
the fourth and final candle that was set up, she reflected on a
pattern emerging. Each of the boxes so far had contained a gift of
some sort from Shizuru. The special mayonnaise and Duran-chan had
been explicitly given as gifts, and Shizuru had always referred to
that pair of handcuffs as being Natsuki’s, though both of them had
taken their turns being restrained with them. It seemed that in place
of the letters Natsuki had placed out for her proposal, Shizuru was
lining the hallway with gifts she’d given over the years.</p><p>Only one candle was
left, close to the door to their bedroom – which Natsuki noticed
was left closed, unlike how she’d left it open for Shizuru – and
Natsuki suspected that Shizuru would have saved the best for last.
Her suspicions were reinforced when she read the label on this final
box: “Your love.” There was only one possibility that Natsuki
could think of here, though she wasn’t sure what Shizuru would have
put in the box to represent it. Her love was simply Shizuru. There
could be no question there. But of course, Shizuru couldn’t have
put herself into the box.</p><p>It was likely some gift
which represented Shizuru then, and how she’d given herself to
Natsuki. Her wedding ring maybe? That would get the message across,
though Shizuru had sworn to never take it off. It was possible she’d
make an exception for something like this, but it didn’t seem too
likely. Probably something to do with their wedding, though. It was
the most meaningful event in their relationship – possibly tied
with their first couple of nights together, but Shizuru had already
used two gifts from then. It had to be their marriage.</p><p>Natsuki slowly opened
up the box, trying to drag out the final revelation as much as
possible. Eventually, a heart-shaped frame came into view, and she
knew immediately what Shizuru had chosen. It was one of the many
pictures that had been taken on their wedding day, and probably the
most professional-looking. It was the only one for which they’d
been able to tear their eyes off of each other, though their embrace
kept them practically glued together.</p><p>Shizuru was more
beautiful than ever in the picture. She’d used some of her family’s
fortune to have a magnificent kimono specially made for the occasion.
It was a pale brown to match her hair, decorated with an array of
flowers. The most prominent were sakuras, to symbolize the day she
and Natsuki had first met. Natsuki had had a similar idea with the
sakuras, though she’d decided to use an actual flower, which she’d
nestled in her hair. Shizuru had almost fainted when she saw it,
overwhelmed by the thought that Natsuki thought it was as significant
to them as she did.</p><p>It wasn’t just the
sakura that Shizuru adored, though. She seemed to love everything
Natsuki had done with her outfit. Natsuki had never been good at
judging how well she looked, so she’d taken some guesses with what
she thought Shizuru would like, along with some advice from her
father – who’d started insisting that Natsuki refer to him as her
father as well as soon as he’d heard about the engagement. She’d
ended up settling on wearing a dark blue kimono, which was elegant in
its simplicity, in contrast to the elaborate kimono Shizuru had worn.
At the suggestion of Shizuru’s father, she’d also braided her
hair for the occasion. She’d been wary, but he insisted that
Shizuru would love it, and he was quite right.</p><p>What Shizuru loved
most, though, about Natsuki’s appearance at their wedding had
actually been the small bit of makeup she’d relented to wearing: a
small touch of blush on her cheeks. Natsuki knew how much Shizuru
loved seeing her blush, but she was feeling far too happy and
confident about their marriage to possibly be able to do it
naturally. The makeup didn’t make her cheeks nearly as red as
Shizuru was able to when she put her mind to it, but it was just
enough to give the impression that she was constantly blushing.
Shizuru had loved the gesture so much that Natsuki had relented to
repeating it on a few other special occasions, as uncomfortable as
she was with makeup.</p><p>As she felt tears start
to well up in her eyes again at the memory of their wedding day,
Natsuki decided that it was probably time for her to go in and see
Shizuru. If she were going to break out in tears tonight, she wanted
Shizuru to be there to see it. With this thought in mind, she turned
to the door, which was all that remained standing between her and her
love. In the flickering candlelight, she noticed that Shizuru had
even put a label on the door.</p><p>Natsuki moved her head
in close to read the label: “Your family.” <i>Of course.</i> She
grinned.<i> You’re all the family I need, Shizuru.</i> Natsuki
straightened up and slowly turned the doorknob. When she’d turned
it all the way, she let her eyes drift shut as she pushed the door
open and walked into the room.</p><p>Shizuru’s hug, which
Natsuki had been waiting far too long for, came from directly in
front of her this time. It was the perfect angle for Natsuki to wrap
her own arms back around Shizuru to pull her body close. She opened
up her eyes to gaze into Shizuru’s orbs, which were blazing crimson
in the candlelight. “I love you, Shizuru.”</p><p>“I love you too,
Natsuki,” Shizuru whispered. Her head drifted forward, quickly
closing the distance between her lips and Natsuki’s. Natsuki
allowed herself to be absorbed into the sensations of Shizuru’s
lips against her own, feeling the soft, velvety flesh slowly moving
against her. Neither of them felt any pressure to deepen the kiss; it
was a simple reaffirmation that they were both there for each other
and still connected.</p><p>They parted after a
minute, but Natsuki didn’t let their heads get too far apart. She
rested her forehead against Shizuru’s and gazed into her love’s
eyes. Not much of the candlelight could make its way in to illuminate
them, but it just seemed to make Shizuru all the more enchanting.
After another minute of simply gazing at Shizuru, Natsuki whispered,
“Thank you for all this, Shizuru.”</p><p>“Ara, Natsuki’s
very welcome,” Shizuru said. Her lilting Kyoto-ben made Natsuki’s
heart leap in her chest. “But you don’t even know what I’m
doing all of this for yet.”</p><p>“It doesn’t
matter,” Natsuki said. “Whatever you were going to ask for, you
can have it. There’s no way I can deny you after all of this.”</p><p>Natsuki couldn’t see
Shizuru’s mouth, but her eyes showed definite signs of a smile.
“Ara, that’s quite tempting, Natsuki, but I really should tell
you about this before we make a final decision.” Shizuru backed her
head away from Natsuki’s and slowly withdrew from the hug. Her hand
met Natsuki’s and lightly pulled on it. “I think it’s best if
we sit down for this.”</p><p>Natsuki nodded as
Shizuru pulled her to the bed. She took this chance to assess the
setup of the room, and she was pleased to note that Shizuru had
decided to go with candlelight here as well. There were only a
handful of candles set up in the room, but it was all the light
they’d need. “So, what did you want to ask me, Shizuru?”
Natsuki asked as they sat down on the bed.</p><p>“Natsuki…”
Shizuru said. She picked up Natsuki’s hand and cupped it in her
own. “Everything seems perfect between us now. We have a house of
our own, we both have steady jobs, and our relationship is as strong
as ever. That’s why I’m bringing something up again that we
talked about briefly on a couple of occasions long before. I really
hope you’re ready now. I know I am.”</p><p>Natsuki nodded slowly
at this. She still had no idea what Shizuru might be talking about.
“What is it, Shizuru?”</p><p>Shizuru took a deep
breath to gather her courage. Her eyes met Natsuki’s, full of
nervousness and hope. “Natsuki… I want to have your baby.”</p><p>Natsuki froze in shock
at Shizuru’s words. “M… my… my baby?” Shizuru nodded slowly
at her. <i>A child? Could I really be a mother? But… no… this
can’t work… </i>“Shizuru… um, how can I say this? Wouldn’t
I need to be, you know, a guy for you to have my baby anyways?”</p><p>A mischievous twinkle
appeared in Shizuru’s eyes. “Imagine it is possible, Natsuki,”
she said softly. “I know that you’ve dreamed about us having a
child that is truly ours. If it were really possible, would you want
to?”</p><p>Natsuki was finding it
hard to resist the look Shizuru was giving her. She wanted to agree,
just for Shizuru’s sake, but she knew that she needed to give her
own opinion here. Breaking her gaze away so she could think clearly,
Natsuki thought about the prospect of having a daughter. It was a bit
frightening, definitely, but the thought of merging herself with
Shizuru to create a new human being stirred her heart. It seemed
fulfilling somehow. It made sense as the next step in their life
together. But it was still a daunting prospect, a huge commitment.</p><p>“Er… maybe,” she
said, bringing her gaze back to meet Shizuru’s. “But what’s
this all about Shizuru? Wouldn’t it make more sense to talk about
adoption or something if you want to have children?”</p><p>There was that twinkle
again in Shizuru’s eyes. “But this is possible,” she said, her
voice filled with what seemed to be restrained elation now. “My
mother told me of some wonderful news a few weeks ago. There’s been
some amazing technology developed recently. Basically, it would let a
doctor take some of your bone marrow and convert it into sperm. Then
we could use it when the time is right for me and make a baby – a
daughter, of course – that would be our very own.”</p><p><i>Our own daughter…</i>

The words echoed in Natsuki’s head. She couldn’t deny that it was
tempting. But the prospect of experimenting with new technology
didn’t quite sit right with her. “Shizuru…” she said. “Are
you sure this is alright? What if something goes wrong?”</p><p>Shizuru gave a
comforting smile at this. “You don’t know my mother like I do. If
there were any chance something could go wrong, she wouldn’t let me
do this. It’s already gone through all possible tests, and they
know that it works just fine. There’s nothing to worry about.”</p><p>Natsuki nodded slowly.
“I guess…” She let out a sigh. It was still too much for her to
take on right now. “I need more time to think about this, Shizuru.
This is a huge step.”</p><p>Shizuru smiled
lovingly. “Of course. I didn’t really expect you to come to a
decision right away. It took me quite a bit of thought to know that I
was okay with this. There’s no reason we need to do this right
away, if we’re going to. You can have all the time you need to
decide.”</p><p>“Right, okay,”
Natsuki said, sighing with relief that Shizuru wasn’t expecting an
immediate answer.</p><p>“I’m sorry if I got
you thinking that I wanted an answer right away, Natsuki,” Shizuru
said. “It’s just… the idea popped into my head to make this
like my own proposal to you, and I couldn’t resist. The night you
proposed to me was so beautiful, I wanted to let you experience the
same type of magic.”</p><p>Natsuki brought her
eyes up to meet Shizuru’s again. Even in the dim light, her love
shone through brilliantly, and Natsuki let it envelop her. All the
emotions she’d pushed to the back of her mind as she was
considering Shizuru’s proposal resurfaced. After only a few moments
of thinking about all Shizuru had done for her this night, a pair of
tears finally managed to break their way out of her eyes to drip down
her cheeks. “I did, Shizuru. Thank you.”</p><p>“Anything for my
Natsuki,” Shizuru said, a sweet smile crossing her face. After
another moment gazing back, she suddenly struck a contemplative pose.
“Now, if I remember correctly, there was something else very
romantic Natsuki did for me after I accepted her proposal. Now what
was it…?”</p><p>Natsuki barely had time
to remember what she’d done next before Shizuru rolled her onto the
bed and climbed on top of her. She squeaked out a yelp of surprise,
but any thoughts of complaints quickly evaporated when Shizuru’s
lips met her own.</p><hr>Natsuki drifted awake.
Something in her mind was nagging for her attention. As she lay
there, hints of memory drifted back to her mind. There was a girl in
her dreams, a young girl. A girl who called both her and Shizuru,
“Mommy.”<p>She rolled over to look
at Shizuru, who was still sleeping peacefully. <i>Yeah, I think you’d
be a great mother, Shizuru. I have no idea how I’ll do, but I know
you’ll be strong enough for both of us if you have to be.</i></p><p>Natsuki moved her head
over to give Shizuru a quick peck on the cheek. “I’m ready if you
are, Shizuru,” she whispered. A smile crept across Shizuru’s
features in her sleep.</p>
