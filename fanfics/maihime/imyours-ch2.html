Want You</p><hr>“Wait, where are you
going, Shizuru?” Natsuki asked as Shizuru turned the car away from
the path to her house.</p><p>“Ara?” Shizuru
said. She kept her eyes on the road, but Natsuki could see her near
eyebrow rise questioningly. “Doesn’t Natsuki wish for me to take
her home?”</p><p>“What? No!” Natsuki
rolled her eyes in frustration. She suspected that Shizuru was just
teasing her, but it was hard to tell without getting a good look at
her face. “You didn’t think that camera was the only thing I’d
give you for our first Christmas together as a… you know…”</p><p>“As a what, Natsuki?”
Shizuru said in her usual teasing tone.</p><p>Natsuki growled
lightly. She’d walked right into that one. She really had wanted to
save that admission for a bit longer, but there was really no denying
it now. They’d spent almost the entire night of Shizuru’s
birthday making out in her bed, falling asleep in each other’s arms
afterwards. And at the Christmas party today, Shizuru had spent so
much time glued to her and “accidentally” groping her without
Natsuki pushing her way that by this point not one of their friends
would hesitate to call them a couple.</p><p>“Just go to your
house, Shizuru,” Natsuki said. She stuck her tongue out at Shizuru,
though she wasn’t sure if her friend caught it. “I can explain
what we are there.”</p><p>Shizuru didn’t
respond, but she did start making some turns to get back on track to
her house. After some time of driving in silence, she said, “It
might not have been your real gift, Natsuki, but that camera was a
really sweet idea. I’m thinking of starting my own photo album of
all of Natsuki’s cute moments.”</p><p>Natsuki couldn’t help
a blush rising to her face even though that was exactly what she’d
had in mind when she’d bought the camera for Shizuru. She was used
to her body being ogled by guys and the occasional girl, but being
considered cute was still a bit new to her. And with Shizuru being
the admirer, even the standard comments about her beauty felt
different somehow. “Er, well I couldn’t just get you nothing in
front of everyone else…” she said nervously.</p><p>Shizuru chuckled
lightly. “That was exactly what I thought, too, though I’m sorry
my gift couldn’t be quite as insightful.”</p><p>“Insightful? Who
cares about insightful?” Natsuki said. “You improved on the taste
of mayonnaise! I don’t know how you managed it, but you better
teach me how, as you’ve spoiled me for the regular stuff.”</p><p>“Ara, now that is a
secret,” Shizuru said. Natsuki didn’t need to see her face to
know she had her giant teasing grin on it. “If Natsuki needs more,
she’ll have to make sure she sticks with me so I can make it for
her.”</p><p>A flash of inspiration
struck Natsuki at this comment, and she took a stab at a tease of her
own. “Pfft, as if I need more incentive to stick around with you!”</p><p><i>Score.</i> 
Natsuki’s
tease hit home, and a blush spread its way across Shizuru’s face.
Her suspicion was correct: The status of their relationship and her
acceptance of Shizuru was the girl’s weak point. It might not last
forever, but Natsuki was going to take advantage of this weakness
while she could to get back at her friend for all the years of
teasing she’d been subjected to.</p><p>Shizuru was silent for
a few minutes as her blush faded. “Natsuki should know better than
to try to distract me while I’m driving,” she said at last.</p><p>“Is that the best you
can do?” Natsuki said incredulously. “You’ve lost your touch,
Shizuru.”</p><p>Not missing a beat,
Shizuru replied, “Ara, then I’d better touch Natsuki quite a bit
to get back on track.”</p><p><i>Damn it!</i> Another
blush rushed to Natsuki’s fate, both from the nature of Shizuru’s
tease and from the fact that she was sure her friend had deliberately
planned it out and she’d fallen into her trap. She tried to think
of a good comeback, but Shizuru’s house had come into view and her
time quickly ran out. She resolved to put on a pout and give Shizuru
the silent treatment as they entered her house.</p><p>She kept her pout up as
they walked inside, but Shizuru stopped at the doorway as she passed
to kick off her shoes in the closet. She heard a petulant “Ikezu!”
come from behind her and turned to gaze at Shizuru quizzically.
Shizuru’s face held a pout that put Natsuki’s to shame, and she
dejectedly pointed to the ceiling. “Natsuki walked right under the
mistletoe with me without kissing me!”</p><p>Natsuki glanced up and
saw that Shizuru had told the truth. However, the sight of the
mistletoe cued something in her mind from their previous
conversation. “Shizuru, if you weren’t planning to take me back
to your house tonight, then why did you hand mistletoe over the
entrance?” she said accusingly.</p><p>Shizuru was taken aback
for a moment, but she quickly recovered. She put on her best fake
hurt expression and said, “Forgive me, Natsuki. I just couldn’t
resist the tease of forcing you to ask to come over here. You know
how much I like seeing Natsuki all cute and flustered…” Shizuru
punctuated this with a pathetic sniff.</p><p>Natsuki wasn’t fooled
at all by Shizuru’s act – she assured herself – but she still
couldn’t bear to see her friend acting like that. Even when Shizuru
was pouting about being allowed to tease her – which Natsuki had to
remind herself she still hated – she just couldn’t hold herself
back. The sight of Shizuru in distress was just too much to bear.</p><p>Silently cursing the
woman’s effortless hold over her, Natsuki returned to her friend.
She gently cupped Shizuru’s chin in her hand as she tilted her
friend’s face up to give her a soft kiss. She could feel the fake
frown fade from Shizuru’s face in an instant as the girl returned
the kiss. After only a couple seconds of moving her lips in just the
right way, Shizuru had Natsuki completely entranced by her. Of
course, she chose just this moment to break the kiss.</p><p>“Thank you, Natsuki,”
Shizuru said sweetly as she walked around the dazed girl to deposit
her shoes and coat in the closet. She then strolled off to her
bedroom without a further word.</p><p>As her senses came back
to her, Natsuki growled petulantly as she turned to take off her own
coat. <i>Damn that woman…</i> She tried to think up a way to get
back at Shizuru as she headed into her bedroom, but her thoughts were
immediately interrupted when she was caught in a sudden hug as she
walked through the doorway. “Shi-Shizuru…” she protested,
though the feeling of being in her friend’s arms was too
comfortable for her to put much strength behind it.</p><p>Shizuru moved her mouth
up to Natsuki’s ears and said breathily, “Just giving Natsuki
fair warning, but there’s quite a bit of mistletoe over the bed as
well.” The feeling of Shizuru’s breath blowing into her ear sent
a wave of shudders through Natsuki, and she was quite sure that it
was precisely the girl’s intention to do that to her.</p><p>“Duly noted,
Shizuru,” she said as she twisted in her friend’s grasp to face
her. Before Shizuru had a chance to guess her intent, Natsuki had
moved her head forward to capture the girl’s lips with her own. She
kept her wits about her through this kiss as best as she could,
trying to keep in control of it. It seemed to be working, and she
soon heard Shizuru let out a light, unconscious moan. She quickly
pulled back upon hearing this, exacting her revenge on the girl for
her withdrawal from their previous kiss. “Just getting in a head
start,” she said.</p><p>Shizuru was still in a
bit of a daze as Natsuki said this, though she was in the more
fortunate position of hugging Natsuki as she recovered. It took her
only a few seconds before she gathered enough of her wits to let out
a pouting, “Ikezu.”</p><p>Natsuki felt an urge to
stick her tongue out at Shizuru, but she quickly suppressed the
instinct. She’d tried that after one tease during their night
together on Shizuru’s birthday, and Shizuru had dived in to capture
her tongue in her mouth before Natsuki had a chance to know what was
happening. A couple of seconds later, she didn’t even care what was
happening.</p><p>Deciding that it might
not actually be so bad, Natsuki kept that idea in the back of her
mind as she decided to get down to the business of the night.
Bringing her hands up to gently push Shizuru out of the hug, she
said, “Why don’t you go sit down, Shizuru, and I can tell you
what I have in mind for your real Christmas present.”</p><p>Shizuru pouted as she
made her way to the bed. “Ara, but isn’t Natsuki going to join
me?” she said as she took a seat up against the headboard.</p><p>“I will,” Natsuki
said, “But with the mistletoe you’ve set up, I’m not going to
have a chance to say much of anything once I do. I really want to get
this all out up front, anyways.” She started pacing near the foot
of the bed as she gathered her thoughts.</p><p>“Really?” Shizuru
said as she quirked an eyebrow. “How long would it take for you to
say, ‘Take me, Shizuru. I’m yours for tonight’?” Shizuru said
the last part in her best breathy, seductive voice, causing a blush
to immediately flood Natsuki’s face. “Or did Natsuki have
something else in mind?”</p><p>“Er, yeah…”
Natsuki said as she tried to shake the blush out of her face. She
leaned back against the dresser behind her as she started to explain
her gift to Shizuru. “First of all, Shizuru, I thought about
writing this all out in a letter again, but I decided against it. I
want you to know that this is all coming straight from my heart, and
I’m not getting afraid and chickening out.</p><p>“Okay, as you’ve
probably decided for yourself, I was an idiot last week. Trying to
give myself to you for your birthday before we were even a couple was
an insane idea, even though everything managed to work out pretty
good. I probably could have gotten us to that point without being a
complete idiot, but whatever. I’m really grateful that you didn’t
really push me into things then, Shizuru. In retrospect, I think our
night of making out and cuddling with each other was what I really
needed, even if it did result in me drifting off to sleep all hot and
bothered and making my dreams even more explicit.”</p><p>A smile had split
across Shizuru’s face as Natsuki said this. She was probably
agreeing with the part about Natsuki acting insane, though she
fortunately didn’t say anything about it. “Ara, I knew Natsuki
was secretly a little cuddle-bunny,” Shizuru said with a wink. “I
figured it would be the perfect way to start off our relationship, by
getting that little secret of yours out and having fun with it.”</p><p>Natsuki felt herself
shrink a little. She just knew she’d be hearing the term
“cuddle-bunny” again, and probably quite frequently. It was a
strange feeling to have Shizuru prying out all of her girlish secrets
which she’d tried so hard to cover up in her public image. But it
wasn’t a bad feeling, necessarily. She felt exposed, but with
Shizuru, she didn’t really mind that. It felt right to share all of
herself with the girl.</p><p>Pushing the thought of
being Shizuru’s personal “cuddle-bunny” out of her mind,
Natsuki continued with what she’d planned to say, “Anyways,
Shizuru, I really misjudged you last week. I offered you my body,
because I thought that was what you wanted. Instead, you ended up
prying your way into my heart. That’s what you really want, I
realize now. You didn’t care at all then whether or not we had sex.
What you cared about was that I was able to realize I was capable of
returning your feelings.”</p><p>Natsuki took a deep
breath to steel herself. This was the part she’d been working up to
all week. She finally had the answer Shizuru wanted to hear. She just
had to say it. “But, as far as I did get with my feelings last
week, it wasn’t as far as you truly wished. You pried your way
pretty far into my heart, but I had to come to one final realization
to let you all the way inside. I’ve been going over everything I
feel so much in this past week, trying to figure it all out.”</p><p><i>You’re starting to
ramble, Natsuki,</i> she mentally chided herself. <i>Just get it over
with! Spit it out!</i> “Shizuru, I…” she started to say, but
her voice failed her. She tried to start again, building up a bit
more momentum, “For your Christmas present, Shizuru, I want you to
know that I’ve finally decided that I… I really…”</p><p><i>Damn it!</i> Natsuki
cursed her own nervousness. Even after all Shizuru had done, it was
hard getting past all the barriers she’d set up in her heart to
keep herself from admitting she needed anyone. But she’d been able
to say this to herself, why couldn’t she say it out loud?</p><p>Natsuki bit her lip
nervously as she raised her gaze to Shizuru to give an apologetic
frown. It was then that she realized the mistake she’d made. She
hadn’t even been looking at Shizuru as she tried to make the
admission. Avoiding her gaze made it harder for her, not easier.
Seeing Shizuru’s gorgeous face, so full of love and hope,
everything became clear. She knew she could get it out now, but while
she was at it, there was one more thing she had to make just right.</p><p>Her gaze locked 
with
Shizuru’s, Natsuki came forward and crawled up onto the bed until
her face was just an inch away from the girl’s. She bent her knees
down into a comfortable position and cradled Shizuru’s face in her
hands. Letting all of her barriers down, she spoke through her heart,
“I love you, Shizuru.”</p><p>Shizuru’s serene mask
shattered as Natsuki said this, and tears started leaking out of her
eyes. “Oh, Natsuki…” She choked back a sob. “I love you too,
so much.”</p><p>As soon as the object
of her affections had had a chance to return the words, Natsuki bowed
to the demands of the mistletoe hanging above the bed and leaned her
head in to meet Shizuru’s begging lips with her own. She allowed
herself to absorb Shizuru’s essence through the kiss, gently
licking her tongue across them to absorb her taste. In addition to
the sweet taste she’d learned to relish the past week, Natsuki
could now sense a slight saltiness, brought on by the girl’s tears.</p><p>Natsuki’s 
conscious
mind lost touch with reality as this realization hit her. She fell
into a state of pure bliss as she felt Shizuru’s lips moving
against her own, the very feeling which had taught her the nature of
her own emotions a week ago. She needed this. It was still
frightening to Natsuki to have to need someone like this, but her
heart told her that with Shizuru, she didn’t have to worry about
being abandoned.</p><p>The two girls let this
kiss last as long as they could, though they’d learned their limits
the previous week. There was no point getting so out of breath they
needed to take a break to recover, so they mutually allowed their
lips to drift apart as they reached the limit of how long they could
comfortably last.</p><p>Natsuki allowed her
gaze to take in Shizuru’s beautiful face. She was quite pleased to
note that it was now filled with a deep blush. Seeing that in the
girl, she could quite understand why Shizuru loved to make her blush
so much. Natsuki smiled at her love. “Merry Christmas, Shizuru.”</p><p>Shizuru smiled back,
tears still leaking from her eyes. “Thank you, Natsuki. I’m glad
you were able to figure out just what I wanted this time.”</p><p>Natsuki leaned back so
she could sit down on the bed; the kneeling position was starting to
cause her knees to get sore. “Yeah. It’s better this way. You
should have my heart before you take my body. Though, um, now that
you have it…” Natsuki cut herself off with a blush and turned
away from Shizuru. <i>Damn it, why can’t I get that stupid fantasy
out of my head? I can’t even stop myself from saying stupid things
like that.</i></p><p>“Ara, that reminds
me,” Shizuru said as she crawled up on the bed to get back into
Natsuki’s line of sight. “I still haven’t given Natsuki my real
present.”</p><p>Something in Shizuru’s
voice caused a wave of shudders to run through Natsuki’s body. She
tried to turn her face away from the girl again, but Shizuru’s hand
shot out to catch her and force her to make eye contact. “Wh-what
is it?” she stuttered.</p><p>Shizuru gave her a
loving and slightly mysterious smile. “Natsuki knows full well that
she has all of my heart, so unfortunately I can’t give that to her.
However, Natsuki has made it quite clear there’s something else she
wants very much, whether she meant to do so or not.”</p><p>Natsuki let out an
unconscious whimper as she knew what Shizuru was hinting at. She
really had had quite a time trying to get that particular fantasy out
of her head. For all that she’d tried to offer it to Shizuru, she’d
been the one who was really desperate for it to be fulfilled. And now
that Shizuru knew this… it was really going to happen.</p><p>“So now…” Shizuru
said, a predatory gleam in her eye. “My present for you is to
fulfill any fantasy you wish.” Shizuru licked her lips hungrily,
giving Natsuki the impression that the girl intended to eat her. As
Natsuki juggled the words around a bit in her mind, it started to
seem like quite a likely prospect.</p><p>She unconsciously tried
to back away from the monster she’d unleashed, pulling her face out
of Shizuru’s grasp. The girl let her move back for a couple
seconds, but then she lunged forward at a startling speed. Before she
was able to react, Natsuki found herself pinned down to the bed by
Shizuru. Her legs were wedged in between Shizuru’s, while both of
her arms were held still by Shizuru’s hands.</p><p>“Now, have I guessed
the correct fantasy, Natsuki?” Shizuru asked. The look in her eyes
would have frozen Natsuki in place even if she weren’t already
immobilized. However, her tone of voice was a bit softer. She was
seriously asking here. She was giving Natsuki a chance to back out if
she wanted.</p><p>Natsuki wasn’t in
much of a position to make a clear decision, but she tried to focus
her thoughts as best as she could. She was definitely nervous here.
The fantasy hadn’t seemed real before, but now that it could
actually happen, her nerves had caught up with her. But nervousness
was to be expected for her first time. The question was whether she
wanted this and was ready for it.</p><p>A single glance at
Shizuru’s face was enough to confirm that she wanted this. The
sight of her love’s lustful gaze made it feel like a fire was
burning in her chest. She definitely wanted this. As for being ready,
she knew she was in love with Shizuru now, and the prospect of
sharing her first time with her felt right. She couldn’t imagine it
being with anyone else. It also seemed like it would be the perfect
way to cap off the night when she’d finally admitted her love.</p><p>Natsuki bit her lip
nervously, and she gave Shizuru a small, quick nod. Her friend had
waited patiently through all of her mental debate, and her expression
had softened into an expression of simple love instead of the lust it
had held at first. Her lips tugged upwards in a smile as she caught
Natsuki’s nod. She bent her head down to give the girl a quick kiss
on her cheek, before she came back up and said, “I know Natsuki’s
nervous, but I promise to be gentle. But if you do need me to stop,
just say so and I will.”</p><p>Natsuki gave another
nod, more confidently this time. She trusted Shizuru completely, and
she was ready to give herself to the girl. Steeling herself, she
looked into Shizuru’s eyes and said, “Thank you, Shizuru, but I’m
not going to ask you to stop. I want this – I want <i>you</i>.”</p><p>“Then Natsuki shall
have me,” Shizuru said. Her mouth drifted down to meet Natsuki’s
lips. Natsuki kept her eyes open until the moment of the kiss,
allowing her world to be filled with the sight of the chestnut-haired
beauty. The contact of their lips sealed the deal in Natsuki’s
mind. She belonged to Shizuru now, and it was up to her lover now to
bring her to unprecedented heights of pleasure.</p><p>Natsuki could feel her
body melting into a pool of lust as she shared this kiss with
Shizuru. She tried to bring her arms up to wrap around her
girlfriend’s back, but Shizuru kept them pinned down. Although she
really wanted to hug her lover at this time, to feel the contact of
their bodies, she accepted this restraint as a concession to letting
Shizuru be in charge of her. The thought of being under the girl’s
control was serving as an even stronger aphrodisiac than the contact
provided by a hug could have.</p><p>By the time Shizuru
released her from the kiss, Natsuki could feel her face burning up
from an uncontrollable blush. The simple concept of what they were
doing had driven her to the blush. It felt quite a bit like it did
when Shizuru teased her. She didn’t mind that, though. Right now,
the thought just served to turn her on, as did the thought that her
blush was making her appear cuter for Shizuru.</p><p>Shizuru’s lips came
back down, hitting a bit off to the side this time. With a series of
kisses, she kissed her way down to Natsuki’s neck. As the flesh
became more tender, Shizuru’s kisses became deeper. Each kiss sent
a rush of pleasure through Natsuki, causing her to strain against
Shizuru’s hold on her. The tension in her kept building up, and she
released it as best as she could through a series of moans. Shizuru
seemed to enjoy her moaning, as she solidified one of her kisses and
pressed her tongue up against Natsuki’s throat.</p><p>After separating from
this kiss, Shizuru pulled her head back from Natsuki’s neck. She
pushed herself up a bit, and she pulled her legs forwards until they
were pinning down Natsuki’s arms, freeing up her hands. The hold on
her arms wasn’t as secure as before, and Natsuki suspected she
could pull her arms out if she wanted to, but she didn’t bother
trying.</p><p>Shizuru used her freed
hands to start working on unbuttoning Natsuki’s blouse as her lips
returned to sucking on the girl’s neck. Her kisses sent a sharp
pleasure through Natsuki’s neck, forcing more moans out of her
mouth as her arms strained against Shizuru’s knees and her legs
thrashed uselessly behind her lover’s back. Shizuru’s fingers
slowly tickled their way down her chest as they unbuttoned her
blouse.</p><p>When the bottom button
was undone, Shizuru came up from her kiss to pull the blouse open and
fold it over Natsuki’s shoulders. She released her knees so she
could pull it past Natsuki’s hands, but she didn’t take it all
the way off as Natsuki had expected. When it was about halfway off,
Shizuru tugged the two sides together and fastened a couple of the
middle buttons. She then released her hands and smiled at her
handiwork.</p><p>Natsuki let out an
unconscious gasp as she realized how Shizuru had tied her up with her
blouse. Shizuru’s manual restraint was one thing, and she’d been
expecting that, but she hadn’t expected the girl to go so far as
tying her up. She really hadn’t had this in mind when she’d
offered to give herself to her friend; she’d just expected Shizuru
to take the dominant position during sex, not tie her up for it. “Um,
Shizuru…” she protested weakly.</p><p>“Ara…” Shizuru
said, seductively rolling out the word. She lightly brought her
fingers up to Natsuki’s breasts and allowed them to lightly trail
their way around. When the feather-light sensation had started to
cause Natsuki to shudder weakly, Shizuru continued, “Is there
something wrong, Na-tsu-ki?” The way she stretched out Natsuki’s
name caused the girl’s heart to skip a beat.</p><p>“Er… it’s just…”
Natsuki struggled to get out past the distracting sensations of
Shizuru’s teasing fingers. She knew that the girl wouldn’t
continue until she’d gotten it out though, so she forced out an
explanation. “I just… want to…” She could feel the blush on
her face deepen, and she threw her head back, but she pushed through,
“…touch you…”</p><p>Shizuru giggled
cheerfully, the beautiful sound causing Natsuki’s blush to deepen
even further. “Alright,” she said. “I can let Natsuki touch,
but if her hands start getting in the way, I’m going to have to tie
them up again.” Her hands paused in their circles around Natsuki’s
breasts, lightly gripping the material of her bra. “But I really do
like the idea of playing with Natsuki’s breasts while she can’t
stop me. Maybe I’ll do that a little first, then provide Natsuki
with something nice to touch later in return. Okay?”</p><p>Natsuki sighed as
Shizuru said this. She didn’t bother responding, as she knew there
was no way she’d win against the girl now. She’d given herself up
to Shizuru, after all, and if she wanted to keep Natsuki’s hands
restrained, she had that right. It wasn’t even that bad, really.
Being held under Shizuru’s control like this was driving her wild.
It wasn’t going quite like she’d fantasized, but the fact that
reality differed from what she expected just reinforced the fact that
Shizuru was the one in charge here. She wasn’t going to complain
about that, though the urge to feel up Shizuru’s body was getting
hard to resist.</p><p>Shizuru must have
spotted the look of acceptance on Natsuki’s face, as her hands got
to work on her breasts. She started lightly kneading the flesh,
eliciting a series of moans from the bound girl. Her thumbs curled in
to lightly flick over Natsuki’s nipples through the bra, which were
already erect from the pleasure she’d been receiving. Shizuru’s
thumbs kept at their actions, sending jolts of electricity through
Natsuki’s body.</p><p>Soon it became too much
for the girl, unable to relieve any of the building stress by
wrapping her arms around Shizuru and squeezing her as she wished, and
her moans started to turn into whimpers. Shizuru took pity on her
then, and she gave Natsuki’s breasts a break from her
ministrations. In this break, however, she rolled Natsuki over a bit
while a hand reached around the girl to deftly unhook her bra. She
quickly pulled it down off of Natsuki’s breasts, though her blouse
prevented it from coming all the way off.</p><p>Shizuru paused in her
actions to gaze over Natsuki’s naked chest. A blush rushed its way
down to Natsuki’s breasts as Shizuru’s gaze gave her the feeling
of being completely exposed and vulnerable. There was nothing she
could do to cover herself up. Her breasts were Shizuru’s for the
taking. Fortunately, Shizuru didn’t wait too long to do the taking,
as her hands soon came back to Natsuki’s breasts to gently massage
the tender flesh.</p><p>Natsuki let out a
whimper as she once again strained at her bonds. Shizuru seemed to
catch this, and she gently teased as she kept up her ministrations,
“Ara? I wonder if my Natsuki has had enough? But this sight is just
too precious to give up…” Shizuru put on her thinking pose for a
moment, as she lightened up her caresses slightly to give Natsuki a
chance to recover a little of her clarity of thought. “Perhaps I
should take this chance to test out my new camera…”</p><p>“Don’t you dare!”
The prospect of Shizuru taking a picture of her in this state cut
straight to the forefront of Natsuki’s mind. No way was she going
to let that happen. She’d tear through her shirt to get out first
if she had to.</p><p>Shizuru’s face lit up
as she broke out into giggles at Natsuki’s outburst. Deflated by
falling for Shizuru’s trap, Natsuki felt her face once again become
flooded with a blush. “Forgive me, Natsuki,” Shizuru said, trying
to stifle her laughter. “Perhaps I went a bit far there. Well, I
guess I’ll have to make it up to you now with something really nice
for you to touch.”</p><p>Natsuki softly growled
at this, though it morphed into a yelp as Shizuru suddenly pinched
her nipples. A few motions of the girl’s hands later, she’d
forgotten that she was supposed to be mad and was as eager as ever to
get her hands on her tormentor. But it seemed that before her hands
would be freed, Shizuru was going to unveil her prize for putting up
with her.</p><p>Shizuru sat straight up
over Natsuki and brought her hands to the hem of her blouse. Not
bothering to unbutton it, she pulled it straight up over her head and
quickly tossed it aside. Natsuki took the chance to gaze at Shizuru’s
massive breasts, which it seemed her bra could barely contain. When
Shizuru reached a hand behind her back to unfasten it, her bra seemed
to leap off of her chest, revealing the beautiful orbs to Natsuki in
all their glory.</p><p>Natsuki was entranced
as soon as Shizuru’s breasts were exposed. If she’d had any
doubts remaining about her inclinations, they certainly would have
been dashed now. She needed to feel them, to suck on them, anything
she could do with them to make Shizuru moan in pleasure. She tried to
do just this, but her hands were still restrained, and she couldn’t
bring her head forward enough. She let her head fall back to the bed
with a dejected whimper, hoping Shizuru would let her go at last.</p><p>“Okay, Natsuki,”
Shizuru said, a smile crossing her face. “You’ve been very good,
so I’ll let you have a chance to touch all you want. But after
then, it’s back to the main course, and I promise to have you
writhing and screaming at my touch before the night is out.”
Shizuru unbuttoned Natsuki’s blouse at last and pulled it and
Natsuki’s bra down and off of her arms.</p><p>Natsuki wasted no time
in attacking Shizuru’s breasts. While her left hand cupped
Shizuru’s right breast and started feeling it up, she wrapped her
right hand around Shizuru’s back to pull her body down so her left
breast was within range of her mouth. She was pleased to hear a
startled gasp come from the girl on top of her as she took her nipple
into her mouth, and she rewarded it by gently sucking on it to try to
elicit even more pleasure in her lover.</p><p>It wasn’t long before
Natsuki heard the first moan come out of Shizuru’s mouth. The sound
was music to her ears, and she kept up her fondling to see how many
more she could draw out. She kept careful track of which motions
seemed to provoke a reaction from Shizuru, and she soon found that
the girl particularly enjoyed it when she licked in circles around
her areola. A few repetitions of this, followed by a gentle bite, had
the girl breaking into whimpers.</p><p>Unfortunately, Natsuki
ended up doing too good a job with Shizuru, as she ended up
collapsing onto Natsuki as her arms gave out. Shizuru yelped in
surprise when this happened, though any sounds Natsuki might have
made were stifled by the breast she’d almost inhaled. With a
chuckle, Shizuru pushed her way back off of Natsuki. When her face
came into view, Natsuki was pleased to see that it was filled with a
beautiful blush.</p><p>“I think Natsuki has
had enough fun for now,” Shizuru said, a gentle lilt to her voice.
“And I think I’m going to have to properly pay her back for what
she just did to me.”</p><p>Natsuki started to form
a reply, but all words failed her as Shizuru’s mouth found its way
to her right breast. All she managed to let out was a strangled moan
as she experienced firsthand what she’d done to Shizuru. Shizuru’s
hand kept busy with Natsuki’s left breast, working in a seemingly
magical pattern which kept the pleasure rising higher and higher. The
pleasure Shizuru’s mouth brought her was indescribable, and it only
got worse when Shizuru’s tongue came in to assist. Each gentle
circle around her nipple send a wave of ecstasy shooting through her
body, eventually leading to her shuddering under Shizuru’s motions.</p><p>Shizuru soon moved 
her
mouth over to Natsuki’s left breast to give it the same pleasurable
treatment she’d provided her right. Natsuki’s body started to
tense up from the incessant waves of pleasure, and her hands gripped
tightly onto the bedsheet beneath her. It just wasn’t enough to
release all the tension though, and she was starting to feel the urge
to touch Shizuru once again. Hoping her lover wouldn’t punish her
for her hands getting in the way, she brought the two of them to the
back of Shizuru’s head and pulled her down into her breast,
delighting in the soft texture of the girl’s hair.</p><p>Although Shizuru was
careful to keep her mouth firmly on Natsuki’s breast and gently
licking her nipple, Natsuki could feel her legs swinging off to the
side of her. She soon realized Shizuru’s intentions as the girl’s
hands gripped the waistband of her pants. In her current state of
mind, she couldn’t find a trace of modesty or inhibitions
remaining. All she could think of to do was to lift her hips off of
the bed to help Shizuru slide her pants down, and then to bend her
knees up so the girl wouldn’t have to move back and take her mouth
away from Natsuki’s breast.</p><p>She did end up doing
this, much to Natsuki’s disappointment, though not before giving
the girl a gentle bite on her nipple first. The action resulted in
Natsuki letting out a high-pitched yelp before she could stop
herself, making her blush and bring her hands to her face as soon as
she realized how girlish that sounded, trying to hide from Shizuru’s
amused giggles.</p><p>“Ara, Natsuki
shouldn’t be ashamed of sounding so cute,” Shizuru said. From the
sound of the voice, Natsuki judged that she was probably sitting up
off to her side, though she still didn’t dare look. “I wonder
what other cute sounds I can get Natsuki to make. Perhaps if I were
to do a little something around here…”</p><p>Natsuki let out a
startled gasp as Shizuru’s finger started to trace along the crotch
of her panties. The fabric provided the perfect medium to tease
through, as Natsuki could feel just enough of the pressure from
Shizuru’s finger for it to tickle and distract her, but it wasn’t
anything near what she craved. Of course, this being Shizuru, she
kept up working on just this spot for what seemed like hours as she
casually used her other hand to slide off Natsuki’s socks.</p><p>This still wasn’t
enough teasing time for Shizuru, and she kept torturing Natsuki in
this position for interminable minutes more. Natsuki tried to bring
her hands down to pull her panties off herself at one point, but
Shizuru quickly swatted them away. “Now, what did I tell you about
your hands getting in the way, Natsuki?” she asked.</p><p>Natsuki let out a
frustrated moan as she returned her hands to her sides and dug her
fingers into the sheet again. Shizuru was really driving her wild
here, and her dominating behavior just made the situation all the
more arousing. But she was really reaching the end of her rope now.
Swallowing her pride, Natsuki resorted to begging. “Shizuru,
please…” she said in her best pleading voice. She even tried to
make it high-pitched and girly, in case that was what Shizuru was
looking for.</p><p>Shizuru’s torturing
finger paused, and as the haze over her mind cleared a bit, Natsuki
was able to focus on her tormentor’s face. Surprisingly, she found
that Shizuru’s cheeks were filled with an adorable pink blush.
Somehow she’d inflicted that on her lover, though she couldn’t
figure out quite how. “Ara…” Shizuru said. “I just can’t
resist that tone, Natsuki…”</p><p><i>So that’s it,</i>

Natsuki mused. However, whether Shizuru was planning to proceed or
not, she’d paused a moment too long for Natsuki to be able to
handle. She tried to beg with her again, “Please… I need you…”
Natsuki let out a whimper as she tried to move her hips against
Shizuru’s finger. Though the feeling of it had been torturing her
mere seconds ago, she was begging for it now. She just needed <i>more</i>.</p><p>Shizuru let 
out a small
whimper of her own in response to Natsuki’s behavior. “Natsuki
has been such a very good girl tonight…” she purred. “I guess
it’s time for her reward.”</p><p>Natsuki let out a small
squeal of delight as Shizuru finally moved her hands to the waistband
of her panties. She was far past caring about appearing too girly;
all she cared about was that Shizuru liked it. Shizuru wasn’t as
quick as Natsuki would have preferred in removing them, though at
least she wasn’t purposefully being slow to tease her.</p><p>Soon enough, Natsuki
was left lying there completely exposed to her lover. Shizuru paused
for a moment as she took in the sight of Natsuki’s womanhood,
causing the girl to unconsciously blush as her girlfriend appraised
her. It felt so strange being on display like this, and Natsuki had
to resist the urge to at least pull her legs closed. The saving grace
of the experience was that Shizuru seemed to absolutely adore what
she saw, judging by the enraptured smile on her face.</p><p>After a few moments of
simply gazing, Shizuru brought her fingers in to start testing
Natsuki’s responses. She traced a finger enticingly around the
outside of Natsuki’s lips first, forcing an involuntary shiver from
the girl at the almost ticklish sensation. Shizuru’s finger then
traced its way directly down her slit, applying only a very soft
pressure. Natsuki let out an unconscious whimper, though she couldn’t
tell if it was from the fear of more teasing or simply from the
pleasurable sensations of the finger against her sensitive skin.</p><p>Shizuru’s finger then
traced its way back up, pressing a bit harder this time, much to
Natsuki’s relief. It kept up this behavior, pressing a little
harder on every pass. By the time Shizuru’s fingertip had dug its
way inside, Natsuki found herself moaning in time with Shizuru’s
motions. Operating on instinct, Natsuki allowed her legs to drift
apart, pulling her lips apart and exposing her core to Shizuru.</p><p>Shizuru let out a slow
gasp as Natsuki exposed herself to her. “So precious…” she said
breathily. Natsuki was far beyond caring about being exposed. At this
point, it just served as a turn-on that Shizuru could see inside of
her.</p><p>Shizuru slowly started
to continue her explorations. She brought in a finger from her left
hand to slowly trace its way around the bottom of Natsuki’s slit,
while the fingers of her right hand searched for a particular target
near the top. The motions of her fingers quickly started to send wave
after wave of pleasure through Natsuki. She allowed herself to lie
back and ride the waves, using her hands to keep a grip on the bed so
she didn’t start thrash out in one of the muscle spasms that
started to hit her.</p><p>Natsuki let out a sharp
gasp of pleasure as Shizuru’s fingers found a hypersensitive spot
inside of her. The mere contact felt like it sent a bolt of lightning
upwards through her body. But Shizuru didn’t stop there. She kept
up slowly massaging the spot, sending bolt after bolt of pleasure
through Natsuki’s body. She had to grip her fingers down even
tighter on the bedsheet to keep herself from jerking off the bed as
these hit. Her eyes clenched shut as the tension started to build up
in her body past her ability to control her own muscles.</p><p>Natsuki was soon
letting out a moan with every jolt of pleasure that hit her.
Shizuru’s fingers then seemed to vary their pace, and Natsuki got
the distinct impression that Shizuru was playing with her, trying to
have fun controlling the rhythm of Natsuki’s moaning. She didn’t
care though; she was quite enjoying allowing her body to be
completely under Shizuru’s control.</p><p>Shizuru slowed her pace
after a bit, and then came to almost a complete stop with her right
hand, while her left hand disappeared completely. Her motions were
subtle, but just enough to keep Natsuki from descending from her
heights of pleasure. Natsuki felt Shizuru moving on the bed beside
her, and she was soon surprised to feel Shizuru’s mouth meet her
own. She didn’t have the presence of mind to think about it, so she
let her instincts drive her as she returned her love’s kiss and
wrapped her arms around the girl.</p><p>Shizuru moved her head
back a bit from the kiss, and Natsuki now felt her finger prodding at
her entrance. She braced herself for the moment when it made its way
in, when her virginity would officially be lost to her lover. Well,
so she figured at least. Her hymen had long since been broken in
battle, so she couldn’t use that to judge. The penetration of
Shizuru’s fingers seemed as good a marker as any.</p><p>There was no doubt left
in her mind. She was ready for this, and she wanted to give it to
Shizuru. She allowed her eyes to drift open so she and Shizuru could
share this moment with their eyes locked. Shizuru’s crimson orbs
were filled with love for her, and Natsuki did her best to return it
in her own eyes. “I love you, Shizuru,” she whispered
instinctively.</p><p>“I love you too,
Natsuki,” Shizuru said as she plunged her finger into Natsuki’s
depths.</p><p>Natsuki let out a gasp
as Shizuru filled her up. Even with just the single finger, her walls
were squeezing down on it tightly. She’d never even experienced
something like this before, even doing it to herself. For such a long
time, she’d had no interest in romance or sex at all. It was only
over the past few weeks that she’d considered it, but she’d
wanted to save everything for Shizuru.</p><p>It had certainly been
worth the wait. The feeling of Shizuru’s finger deep inside of her
was heavenly, and the thought that it was Shizuru doing this to her
caused a delightful warmth to spread through her chest. Shizuru’s
finger remained still as Natsuki allowed herself to relax and get
used to its presence inside of her. It only took her a few seconds
before she was wondering how she’d ever lived not being connected
to Shizuru like this.</p><p>And then the finger
started moving. It pulled slowly back out, and then pushed back in.
Natsuki breathed deeply in rhythm with its movements. When it thrust
again, her breath turned into a moan of pleasure. Shizuru kept up the
pace, each thrust of her finger pushing Natsuki higher into the
throws of ecstasy.</p><p>As the pace picked up,
Natsuki’s mind started to fall into a mist of passion. She felt
like her body was being filled with a passionate fire, every nerve in
her body alight. Her sense of sight started to fail her, her vision
clouding over, leaving only an image of Shizuru’s face imprinted on
her mind’s eye.</p><p>Her world consistently
only of the motions of Shizuru’s finger inside of her and the
euphoria it was inducing in her body. Each thrust of sent a wave of
pleasure coursing through her body, and it was all she could do to
hold herself steady by gripping onto the girl above her. A series of
moans forced their way out of her mouth, becoming more rapid and
high-pitched as Shizuru’s pace picked up.</p><p>Tension started to
swell up in Natsuki’s body, and she realized that she was headed
for her first orgasm. She felt so good at that moment that she wished
she could stretch it out forever, and yet she also desired to
experience that peak that she knew was coming. Her muscles started to
tighten on Shizuru’s finger, squeezing the life out of it as it
pushed her ever higher. And yet despite this, Shizuru still somehow
managed to slip in a second finger, pushing Natsuki past her
threshold.</p><p>Pleasure exploded in
every nerve of Natsuki’s body at once, and a bright flash of light
enveloped her vision. A scream tore loose from her lungs, and she
gripped onto Shizuru for dear life. Nothing seemed to exist but her
and Shizuru, who she saw in that moment simply as distilled love. The
moment seemed to last forever, and yet she fell from it all too soon.</p><p>Emotion flooded 
through
Natsuki as she descended from her climax. Sobs broke out her throat
and tears started to pour uncontrollably from her eyes. All she could
think of to do about it was to hold Shizuru’s body against hers.
She needed the girl. Her heart belonged to Shizuru, and she was no
longer capable of living without her. Shizuru held her back as she
returned to earth, her right hand gently stroking inside of her to
work out the aftershocks that pulsed through her body as he left hand
wrapped around Natsuki’s back to hold her steady.</p><p>As soon as she’d
gained enough control of herself, Natsuki moved her hands to the back
of Shizuru’s head and pulled her in for a desperate kiss. She
sobbed into the mouth of her lover, still unable to hold back the
burst of emotion. It felt like every feeling she’d bottled up for
so long was pouring out of her now. All the repressed love for
Shizuru was piling up in that one moment.</p><p>Eventually she managed
to settle down, though her body still felt alive with pleasure. She
let out a contented moan as her lips parted from Shizuru’s. Opening
her eyes to lay her vision on the goddess who provided her with all
of this, she said, “Thank you Shizuru, it was perfect.”</p><p>Shizuru smiled back at
her, making the vision all the more lovely. “Anytime, Natsuki. I’m
glad I could help fulfill your fantasy, and I’m so happy I could be
your first.” After another moment of gazing at her, Shizuru slowly
extracted her fingers from Natsuki’s depths and rolled off of her.
Natsuki rolled onto her side to face her lover and reclaim her in a
hug, and they spent many more moments in that position just basking
in each other’s presence.</p><p>As Natsuki’s mind
started to clear, and she figured she had enough control over
herself, she said to Shizuru, “Um, Shizuru, just a couple little
problems.”</p><p>“Oh?” Concern
filled Shizuru’s face.</p><p>Natsuki continued
quickly, not wanting to let Shizuru think she’d done anything
wrong, “Well, you’re still technically a virgin, and my fantasy
is only about half over. Though fortunately, I think we can solve
both problems at once.”</p></p>
