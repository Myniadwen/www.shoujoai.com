<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Firefly</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  frowned at Natsuki from a distance as Shizuru left her, behind Reito.  Frowned at the way Natsuki’s eye followed Shizuru, the way her head  tilted, only slightly, so that she could see just a little bit  farther.  Frowned at the way she didn’t say a word.  Only nodded  faux-absently as Shizuru said, <em>Natsuki, I’m going for a while. </em> She wasn’t really absent at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  saw it in her eyes: What she<em> was </em>was distressed.  She had been  staring out at the ocean for as long as Midori had been chancing  glances in their direction, which had been about ten minutes, since  she had started chatting animatedly with Chie.  To be honest, she  hadn’t been paying attention to what the younger girl had been  talking about at all, nor had she been minding what she’d been  saying back. For all she knew, she had just admitted a deep,  impossibly faithful admiration for the Scottish bagpipe. Or Minoru.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  noticed that she hadn’t frowned at Reito leaving with Shizuru.  Maybe this was because she wasn’t as fond of him as she’d  previously thought, but she doubted it.  More likely, it was because  she had a feeling that she’d confirmed Shizuru’s love interests;  most specifically, how they had nothing to do with Reito, or really,  any males at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>After  all, </em>she rationalized, <em>those two had been touted back at  school as </em>the greatest couple in the history of Fuuka Academy, <em>if  I remember right, which means that they’ve probably never so much  as brushed hands. </em>Kids could be stupid.  Rumors could be  stupider, and neither had a tendency to be accurate about much of  anything. <em>But still, they obviously talk.  Which means that Reito  probably knows about Natsuki, if anybody does.  Right? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“--bladder.   Don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  blinked. Hard.  “What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  grinned at her impishly.  “You haven’t been paying attention,  have you?” she said.  Her tone was smooth and wry, matching her  expression. “Off staring into space? Or, more particularly, staring  into <em>his </em>space.”  She indicated the cabin where Reito had  gone.  Midori might have marveled at the girl’s acumen, but for the  fact that she <em>had </em>been fairly indiscreet about the whole  thing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi,  standing next to Chie, smiled only mildly less coltishly. “If I  were you,” she said, and then looked at Chie, as if waiting for  some sort of signal to continue.  Chie nodded at her, and she did: “I  wouldn’t worry about the two of them.  I don’t think they have  any more between them than friendship.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was a twinge in her voice when she said it that somebody less  perceptive than Midori wouldn’t have caught.  “Who said I was  worrying?” she said without thinking about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi and  Chie only grinned at this.  Their grins were identical now, which  Midori found just a little creepy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,”  Chie said.  “Since obviously you <em>weren’t </em>worrying about  it, I guess I’ll have to find somebody else to tell my story to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  frowned, said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Which  story is that, oh wise teacher?” Aoi said, her voice <em>faux-</em>gushy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  it’s nothing special,” Chie mock-sighed.  “Only a story of  love, heartbreak, of tragic romance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait,”  Aoi frowned. “Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Absolutely  not.”  Chie peered with one eye at Midori, who feigned disinterest.   Or maybe she wasn’t faking it. Chie couldn’t tell.  “And  that’s what makes the story so interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  am I, fifteen? </em>Midori thought, a little irate at the act, which  Aoi and Chie were clearly enjoying. “I think I’ll pass,” Midori  said with a fake yawn, and then turned and walked away, leaving Chie  and Aoi thoroughly satisfied with themselves.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Those  two… </em>Midori frowned. <em>They could have just told me outright,  rather than trying to pester me with it. </em> But she had gotten the  message pretty clearly, more or less confirming what she already  knew. <em>I guess that’s just kids for you.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  could only really say that because she had never participated in  gossip herself as a highschooler, and when questioned about her own  love interests for the gossip, or even really just out of curiosity,  she tended to invoke the <em>right of silence </em>technique.  In fact,  she tended to do that when she was questioned in general.  She  couldn’t ever remember a time in her life when she had been  unfailingly open and honest to anybody.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even  Youko, with whom she was the most direct and uninhibited of all of  her friends, didn’t get the <em>whole </em>Midori.  Nobody really  did; different people got different pieces of her, and she supposed  that if they were to all confer and swap what they knew about her,  they’d get a pretty thorough picture.  Even then, though, there  were a few things that she kept firmly to herself; who didn’t have  those things? It was natural, right?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  one less now, </em>she thought, mildly annoyed, resisting the urge to  throw a glance over her shoulder at Chie. <em>So I get curious  sometimes, just like everybody else.  So sue me.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  continued walking until she reached Natsuki, who appeared utterly  lost in thought, staring off at the ocean, but who she was quite  certain was fully attentive, and had been since Midori had stepped  within earshot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s  the eyes.  Her eyes are always alert. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oi!  Natsuki!” she called out when she thought she was close enough. She  raised her hand and grinned, something that she had found was  typically contagious, and a good way to begin a conversation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Apparently,  not with Natsuki Kuga, who barely looked up.  This, Midori would  later realize, was actually an improvement for Natsuki, who, during  her time as a HiME, probably wouldn’t have bothered to acknowledge  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  took with a grin and, when she was only a few feet away from Natsuki,  tried again.  “Natsuki? You in there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  whispered something that sounded an awful lot like <em>piss off</em>,  and Midori stopped, frowning at her, torn between concern and  offense; like a mother whose child has, in the same breath, disowned  her and cried out for help; two things which did not often come  without the other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was silence between them, and suddenly, it seemed as though everybody  on the beach was watching them in utterly transfixed paralysis.  Midori actually chanced a glance around, and nobody was.  It was like  somebody had muted life for her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie was  sitting on the sand, on top of a towel, smiling and moving her mouth  at Aoi, one hand in the air, motioning to emphasize the point that  her mouth was desperately trying to make.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai was  running after Mikoto and Yuuichi, miming play-rage at what, in some  alternate reality where sound was included with the package, may have  been the first alliance between the latter pair for the purposes of  tormenting Mai.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kazuya  and Akane were making out behind a rock in the distance.  Perhaps the  one set that was the same, sound or no.  Midori actually felt a pang  in her chest upon seeing them; something she hadn’t felt in a long  time.  How long had it been since she got to do something like that?  Since the person she did that with had been</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>torn  from me</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  shook her head, and the pang passed, as they always did.  This wasn’t  the first time she had experienced life on <em>mute. </em>Not in the  least.  Her brain seemed to naturally block things out when it  noticed something that her eyes didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>or  when it knows what is about to</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">midori  i think im in love with you</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki’s  eyes were wet, shining as the sun hit them, reflecting the ocean back  at itself. In her eyes, the ocean didn’t move, but rather the world  moved around it and it remained still, as though she were Perseus  reflecting the Medusa in the shield around her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No,  that’s not right. If her shield were useful, her eyes wouldn’t be  like this. </em>Midori didn’t know how else to put it; she shifted  uncomfortably on her back foot as the world shifted its volume,  equally uncomfortably, back to normal. <em>I’ve never seen her like  this. Hell, I’ve never seen her like </em>anything <em>except cool  and detached, save for one particularly embarrassing moment at the  first and only meeting of the HiME Rangers.  What is this?  I don’t  …</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t want to admit it, but she didn’t know what to do. The last  person that had broken down even <em>near </em>her had been in her  class, begging her not to make him repeat the course for his shitty  grade. She had told him to do better next time.  That wasn’t an  option this time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  tried to reach out to Natsuki, but found herself faltering, almost  before she started. <em>What, do I just put my hand on her shoulder  and tell her to buck up like I used to do? I can’t really say that  anymore. I lost my right to tell other people to buck up when I  failed to do it after</em><br />
  that  was different<br />
  <em>How  do you know?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Wouldn’t  you want somebody to talk to you if you were sad?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  opened her mouth again, but this time it was<em> her </em>that had been  muted; her voice worked fine, nothing choked in her throat, but her  head refused to move.  It had suddenly fixated on an image that had  burned itself into her brain months ago—her first time home since  he had died:<br />
      <em>the  door to the apartment opens<br />
        everything  is exactly the same as it was before<br />
        nothings  changed except me im still living in fucking squalor only now its  only my squalor<br />
        i  walk and fling my coat down on the table and something falls off<br />
        a  small folder with his name scribbled on the front<br />
        his  work notebook the one he had used before we left to prepare<br />
        for  just a second i dont notice the little picture of me clipped onto the  side<br />
      </em><br />
  All  she could see in that moment was the folder.  Faded blue, heavily  worn, with coffee stains on a few of the pages, his name was  scribbled onto the little white margin in black ink that had bled a  little bit off, giving his kanji a vaguely drunken appearance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  there she stayed; in that room, seeing nothing of Natsuki, her hand  just outstretched, her mouth hanging open in mid-syllable.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Minoru  felt like an awkward teenager for just a moment; the girl with the  funny-looking hair that was huddled in the bushes behind the cabin  had started to cry softly; it was a small, pathetic sound that tugged  at his heart more than anything had in a long time. He had always  disliked young kids, and maybe that was why.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Only  you’re not 16 anymore.  If only, right? Then you could probably  feel a little better about being stuck in the middle of a bunch of  teenage girls. But you’re not. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  didn’t mean he was any better at dealing with crying girls, nor did  it mean that he had any more desire to. He found his feet beginning  to carry him away from his spot as his mind told his heart, which  protested only a little, <em>she doesn’t know you, and you probably  wouldn’t be able to sympathize anyway. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  couldn’t really argue with that. If he knew teenagers—and he  didn’t, but he was one of the rare adults who still had a fairly  vivid grasp on his own teen years—the girl would, with a little  coercion, tell him everything on her mind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Probably  it was something to do with a boy; maybe even one of the boys here.  In fact, it was probably the one he’d seen earlier with the dorky  spike-cut; (<em>Spikes,</em> Minoru thought on a whim, and grinned) he  knew the faces of all three of the boys there from when he’d been  staring at their camp through a sniper rifle (something that, he  suddenly felt, had been years ago, in another age. He wasn’t sure  why) and of the three, Spikes seemed the only logical choice: Reito,  the one who had helped the girl Midori to fix his wrist, seemed too  old (he had said something about a university), and the boy with the  brown hair had been pretty consistently chin-deep in his girlfriend’s  throat, so he was probably out, unless he was looking for some  sausage on the side.  (This, given the shape of the girl’s hair,  seemed an oddly appropriate analogy). Minoru found this possible, but  fairly unlikely, just given what seemed to be their constant  proximity to one another.  Stranger things had happened, though.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  the girl broke down and told all her horrible, life-wrecking  problems,<em> that </em>would be where the problem came. The true  burden of the old, Minoru knew fairly well, was that they had been  through enough relationships in their lifetimes; seen enough bad shit  happen to other people, and experienced it themselves, that they  found it near-nigh impossible to sympathize with the seemingly  insignificant angst of the young. It was a loss of innocence, to some  extent; when one’s personal issues began to take a backseat to more  immediate things: Worrying about where to live; worrying about how to  eat; worrying about making the next car payment. Or, in Minoru’s  case, worrying about a bush twenty meters away, and whether or not  there was somebody inside of it, waiting to pop out and gut him.  He  didn’t have that specific problem at the moment, but it was a  common one for him.  He had long since gotten used to just putting a  bullet it every suspicious-looking bush he found.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So she  would bare her soul to him, and he wouldn’t really sympathize. And  then what? There was no <em>and then</em>.  Then he would pat her on  the head, and tell her she’d get by somehow, and leave, because he  couldn’t muster enough sympathy inside of him to say anything more  reassuring.  Or, heaven forbid, actually give a shit; by Minoru’s  thinking, that would be even worse than pretending to care, for both  of them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So he  allowed his legs to carry him.  For a few seconds, even, his entire  body agreed with him, and while he felt a little bad about the whole  thing, he was able to at least tell himself that she probably  wouldn’t want to talk to him anyway—<em>hell, most people don’t  like to talk to strangers when they’re that bad, right? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yes,  that was right. His earlier estimation that she would just spill her  guts, that wasn’t right, was it? Right?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Right?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Strangely  enough, it was the girl that spoke first, her small, squeaky voice  shaky and uncertain: “Who are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  frowned and glanced back at her.  He was less than two feet from the  corner of the cabin; he could be out of sight before she could catch  him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  then you would have just run away from a kid who couldn’t be more  than thirteen, crying and scared. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Wouldn’t  that make you a hypocrite?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  didn’t want to think about that. Everybody had things that they  didn’t think about; this was his.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So  instead, he turned around and smiled his biggest <em>don’t-be-afraid-I’m-just-a-nice-man </em>smile. “Minoru,”  he said. “Minoru Alder. Your friends…” <em>knocked me out and  dragged me into a van where I nearly broke my wrist.</em> “Know me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  the guy who was in the trunk,” she said quietly, uncurling herself  from the near-fetal position she had been in just previously.  “I  remember you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  frowned. When he had first been extracted from that miniature,  wrist-destroying purgatory, he had been treated to a view of what he  had <em>thought </em>was everybody in the group, save for the two  girls, Natsuki and Shizuru, who seemed to be angsting at each other  or whatever it was they were doing.  He didn’t remember her, though  come to think of it, he <em>had </em>seen her through his scope  earlier.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not that  he was about to admit that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  I was.” He waited for it; the inevitable, obvious, burning  question: <em>And what, exactly, were you doing in our trunk?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  didn’t come, and he wondered briefly how she could go without  asking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Probably  the same way you can go without asking her what the matter is.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  stood there in silence for a moment. Minoru didn’t bother to  pretend not to notice as she dried her tears; that was rather  childish. Rather, he let her dry her tears without feeling pressured  one way or another; when she was done, Minoru said, “You know,  everybody else is out on the beach.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t really want to go with them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  smiled at that.  “Yeah,” he said.  “Me either.”  He felt like  a father talking to his child for a moment; <em>yeah, me either, grin  grin pat-on-the-head, say, let’s go get some ice cream. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do  you want to go for a walk?” Her question was sudden; it looked as  though she had barely considered it before she asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  frowned at this.  His pistol was on his hip, but the woods weren’t  safe, and pistols were rarely effective against people with big  rifles in trees.  “I don’t really think that’s a good—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay  then. It was good to meet you, Minoru Alder.” She started to walk  away, and for the first time in quite a while, Minoru panicked a  little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey!”  he half-shouted as he started after her.  “It’s—” <em>dangerous,  because in spite of all your boy-angst, there are worse things in  life than not getting in some boy’s pants, and I guarantee you that  getting shot through the chest with a hollow-tipped bullet is one of  them.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dangerous  because there’re animals, like wolves and things. Right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  frowned.  That lie would serve as well as any.  “Yeah. It gets  dangerous out after dark, and neither of us have a flashlight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  do.” She pointed at his shirt, and he frowned; she was right. He  was wearing the shirt he had been wearing while he was sniping, and  it had a flashlight in it.  Just in case.  “So come with me if it’s  so dangerous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  shouldn’t go,” he frowned. “It really is dangerous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  going.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  started to walk, and he cursed silently. <em>Listen to me, dammit, </em>he  thought. <em>Aren’t I supposed to be the adult? The one who knows  what he’s talking about?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Kids  are rarely swayed by logic as feeble as that. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And with  that, he started after her, reaching his hand up under his shirt to  his armpit, making damn sure his pistol was still in there tight,  every instinct in his body screaming at him to just let her the fuck  go, dammit. <em>Let her the fuck go.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  didn’t. It probably saved her life.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
There  wasn’t actually any tea inside the cabin; the only way to heat up  water out there was a fire, and a fire required a beach.  Or, rather,  it required, as a place to place the tinder, something that was not  itself tinder, such as the wooden cabin.  Shizuru didn’t bother to  apologize to him.  Reito hadn’t been expecting tea.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He also  hadn’t been expecting open, frank conversation, but, contrary to  his expectation, the evening’s chat would turn out to be remarkably  open considering that most of his words with Shizuru were rarely  unguarded or unveiled. It was just their way together.  “It’s a  lovely evening, isn’t it?” Shizuru said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Considering  that,” Reito replied, feeling somehow less patient than he used to  be with Shizuru’s unwillingness to speak, “you seemed remarkably  unwilling to pay much attention to it.” Perhaps it was this  initial, unusual display of impatience which coerced Shizuru into  speaking more openly to him. Maybe it was the urgency with which she  felt the need to speak with Reito tonight.  Reito, who, in spite of  her veiled words and half-formed suggestions, she trusted implicitly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  didn’t reply immediately.  She sat down on the front of her calves  and looked at him as he did the same, placing himself directly in  front of her. “You’re certainly directing your attentions in an  unexpected direction tonight, as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  smiled a little, unfazed. “I didn’t say that your focus was  unexpected,” he said, and then, more quietly, as though to hide the  fact that he was speaking frankly at all, “There’s no need to be  defensive, Shizuru. I’m here to help you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  managed a half-smile.  “I’m sorry,” she said quietly. “I’ve  had a bit of a stressful day, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Should  I ask you how you are after the incident in Goza?” he asked this  because he knew that she was probably alright.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No, </em>she wanted to say. <em>No, I’m fine. Simply shaken, and a little  bruised on my wrists, but it was overall nothing important. I’ve  been through worse, after all. </em>“I saw Natsuki kill a man.”  Maybe she was a little more shaken than she’d expected.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  that’s not what stuck with you,” he said, and she nodded her  reluctant agreement.  “Maybe it’s not written on your face, but  it’s still obvious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only  to you,” Shizuru smiled, and for just the barest moment, Reito felt  something very much like affection in her voice.  It was gone from  the air it had moved the instant after he noticed, though, which led  him to question whether it was ever there at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  to Natsuki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  to Natsuki.” It sounded almost like a toast. <em>And to Natsuki! Who  notices that I keep my heart in my pocket, rather than on my sleeve!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A toast,  indeed.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
A/N:
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’ll  conclude their conversation at the start of chapter 18, worry not.  I’m cutting them off here sort of deliberately.  Also, it seems  like I never did find time to talk to Natsuki.  Again, next chapter;  I didn’t expect Minoru and Midori to take up quite so much space.</span></p>
