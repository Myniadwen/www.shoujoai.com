<h1>What Dreams May Come (part 8 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leebot.html">Leebot</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/whatdreams-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><p>To Forgive, Divine</p><hr><i>Ara, Natsuki, I’m so happy I can barely contain it all! That 
kiss was everything I ever dreamed it would be. I barely trusted myself driving to the 
doctor afterwards; I kept drifting off into daydreams about kissing you again when I should 
have been paying attention to the road. And when I got to the doctor and he asked me why I 
felt I needed a flu shot and anti-virals, I actually blurted out that I’d been kissing my 
sick girlfriend! You should have seen him blush, Natsuki, it put all your best blushes to 
shame.</i></p><p><i>I’m really sorry, I know you’re not my girlfriend quite yet, but it just 
came out. I guess I’m really getting ahead of myself here. It’s just that when I kissed you, 
everything felt right. It was perfect. I knew in my heart more than ever that we were 
destined to be together. And that soft emotion I saw in your eyes as you leaned in to me, 
I’m pretty sure that was love, even if you don’t realize it. So, although I know you’re not 
my girlfriend now, I can’t help but think of you as my future 
girlfriend.</i></p><p><i>Forgive me, I’m almost too giddy to write now. You’d think I’d be 
better the morning afterwards, but I had to suppress a lot of it last night, so I guess it’s 
all leaking out now. As you surely know by now, I came back to check on you after going to 
the doctor. I dropped off that letter I wrote for you in the morning, along with the other 
one, which I wrote while watching over you. You’re such a beautiful sleeper, I could have 
stayed there all night just watching. But unfortunately, I needed to get some sleep myself, 
and I didn’t know if you’d welcome me sleeping over, so I had to leave 
eventually.</i></p><p><i>But even that wasn’t the end of the fun for me. When I got back 
home, I went to sleep and had one of the best dreams I’ve ever had. My dream Natsuki was 
there again, and she was much, much nicer to me this time. I think I spent the entire night 
just kissing her. She wouldn’t let me go any further than that, saying that it wouldn’t be 
appropriate until you’d let me in reality, but I didn’t mind. Just dreaming about kissing 
you was more than enough.</i></p><p><i>I love you, Natsuki, so very much. Thank 
you.</i></p><p><i>Your future girlfriend,</i></p><p><i>Shizuru</i></p><hr>Shizuru checked 
her watch as she waited outside the church: 12:59 p.m. <i>Just one more minute.</i> 
According to Yukariko, Nao was due to start her shift in the confessional at 1. Shizuru 
didn’t exactly have to confess her crimes to Nao, but it was the perfect place to ask for 
forgiveness for them.</p><p>As she waited, Shizuru let her mind wander to the events of the 
previous night. She wasn’t quite as giddy about it as she was in the morning, but she still 
couldn’t help letting her smile widen a little further than normal. Time, however, had 
brought with it a few doubts to her mind. Natsuki had been clear before the kiss that she 
was just doing it to try it out, and she’d broken out of it rather suddenly. Even though she 
had a valid excuse for doing so, it still meant that somehow Natsuki’s thoughts had drifted 
to her sickness while they were kissing.</p><p><i>No, I’m not going there.</i> Shizuru made 
an effort to push her doubts away. Sure, nothing was certain yet, but it was still more 
certain than it had ever been before. She’d spent so many months lamenting that she could 
never have Natsuki, she wasn’t going to doubt now that there was more hope than ever. Maybe 
she’d be hurt later, but she was going to cling onto the hope while it lasted. She’d never 
felt this good before, and she wasn’t going to waste it.</p><p>Pulling herself back from her 
thoughts as she heard the church bell ring, Shizuru glanced at her watch again: 1:01 p.m. 
this time. Perfect. She’d seen no one come by lately, likely because many people had left 
campus for the summer. Nao would probably be expecting a dull day of waiting in the 
confessional, so she might even be pleased for the distraction. If nothing else, it meant 
there was less of a chance of anyone being kept waiting if their conversation went 
long.</p><p>Shizuru turned around and headed into the church. Neither Miyu or Alyssa was 
around today, though Father Carter – who had replaced the disgraced Father Greer – would 
likely be around somewhere. Shizuru didn’t notice him at the pulpit, so he was likely either 
in his rectory or cleaning up the basement. The poor man had quite the job to do after the 
Carnival, reassuring everyone that things were alright and no, the apocalypse wasn’t coming. 
Now that things had finally settled down, he still had work to do in cleaning up the areas 
of the church which weren’t open to the public – the school had covered external 
reparations, but they had so much other construction work they needed to do that there just 
weren’t the resources to clean up the rest of the church.</p><p>As Shizuru walked past the 
pews, she noticed that the school had actually done a quite good job of fixing up the 
church, despite their limited resources. When her eyes reached the new bell, she paused in 
her step, remembering what had happened to the old one. It had fallen in the chaos of her 
battle with Natsuki, trapping the other girl within it. Shizuru had then destroyed it with 
the chain of her Naginata, simultaneously freeing Natsuki from it and trapping her in 
Shizuru’s grasp.</p><p>And then, Natsuki had kissed her. The memory was painful in the 
reminder of what she’d done to her beloved in her rage, but also sweet in what Natsuki had 
still been willing to do for her. <i>Truly, Natsuki, I owe you too much for forgiving me. I 
hope one day I’ll be able to make it all up to you so I may deserve your love. But until 
then, I have other people I also need to make amends with.</i></p><p>With this thought, 
Shizuru proceeded into the confessional. Not being very enamored of Western religions, it 
was Shizuru’s first time entering this room, so she took a chance to look around. The room 
was roughly rectangular, with the walls covered with white paint that had started to peel. 
To her immediate left was a wooden screen with some sort of furniture below it, and she 
could see the corner of a chair past the screen. From what she’d heard about confessionals, 
that was likely to block the priest or nun’s vision of the confessor. Given that she didn’t 
see Nao elsewhere in the room, that seemed to make sense.</p><p>“Just kneel down in front of 
the screen, or you could come around to this chair if you’re particularly keen on looking at 
me,” Nao’s voice came behind the screen. It had a distracted note to it that got across the 
message that she really didn’t want to be there.</p><p>Deciding that it might be a bit 
easier if she didn’t have to go through an explanation of what she was doing there if Nao 
saw her, Shizuru kneeled down by the screen, making use of the odd piece of furniture 
installed there to rest her legs. It wasn’t particularly comfortable, but the designers 
likely didn’t have comfort in mind. <i>Now let’s see, how is this supposed to go…?</i> 
<i>Ah, right. </i>“Forgive me Sister, for I have sinned.”</p><p>Shizuru knew that Nao would 
immediately recognize her accent, but was counting that Nao wouldn’t make a big deal of it 
right away. She did take a moment before replying, in which Shizuru wondered if Nao was 
going to start asking her questions. Instead, she got a reply of, “Cough it up then, 
Fujino,” in Nao’s same distracted voice, with an added element of frustration.</p><p>Shizuru 
let out a soft sigh of relief. Taking a deep breath, she plunged into the confession she’d 
prepared, “I’ve done a horrible thing, Sister. It started a few months ago. I was trying to 
protect my friend from another girl who’d been tricked into fighting her. But I didn’t stop 
at simply protecting my friend. I went a step further, and I tried to take revenge on this 
girl. I nearly killed her, but thankfully she survived.</p><p>“But it didn’t end there, 
unfortunately. She was very angered about what I did, and so she used my friend to try to 
lure me out and take her revenge on me. I came to my friend’s defense again, and I attacked 
this girl. I didn’t kill her in this fight, but I did end up killing her mother and crushing 
her spirit.</p><p>“I wasn’t in my right mind when these actions took place, and I’ve since 
come to better control over myself. The girl’s mother was even miraculously returned to 
life, but none of this excuses what I did. In the euphoria of having her mother brought 
back, she even said she forgave me for what I did, but I know that it isn’t that easy. I 
regret what I did to her every day since I regained my senses, and I hope dearly that she 
may someday forgive me, however unworthy I am of her forgiveness.”</p><p>Nao was silent for 
many minutes, as Shizuru wondered what was going through her mind. She’d tried her best to 
let her quite real regret seep into her words, but she’d built up a reputation for often 
being sarcastic which might hurt her now. If Nao thought she was joking here, things could 
end up much worse than before between them. Perhaps doing this through the confessional 
wasn’t the best choice; it could too easily be misinterpreted as a joke.</p><p>Eventually, 
Nao broke the silence. “Cut the crap, Fujino. Get over here and take a seat.”</p><p>Shizuru 
breathed a sigh of relief. That was about as good as she could have hoped for. She stood 
back up, taking a brief moment to straighten out her skirt and stretch her legs. She let her 
regret show through her face as she walked around to take a seat in front of Nao. Nao was 
currently wearing her nun’s habit, though she was making no effort to look like she enjoyed 
it. Shizuru noticed a spot of wetness near Nao’s eye that could have been from a tear, 
though she decided not to comment on it.</p><p>“Forgive me, Sister Nao,” Shizuru said as she 
took a seat.</p><p>“‘Nao-san’ is fine,” Nao said tersely. “I’m not exactly here by choice. 
And I already said I forgave you. I’m not one to go back on my word, whatever you may have 
been thinking… at least to another girl.”</p><p>“Forgive me, Nao-san, then. I didn’t mean to 
imply that. It’s just that I wouldn’t hold you to something you said in those 
circumstances.”</p><p>This was met with a growl from Nao. She glared at Shizuru, but there 
seemed to be some uncertainty in her gaze. “Fine then, I still forgive you. Are you 
happy?”</p><p>Shizuru raised an eyebrow in surprise. This certainly wasn’t what she’d 
expected from Nao. Judging by her actions during the Carnival, she was someone who held 
fierce grudges. “Might I ask why you forgive me so easily?” Shizuru said.</p><p>“Your 
heartfelt apology isn’t enough reason?” Nao couldn’t keep the sarcasm out of her voice, so 
Shizuru simply met her with a passive gaze. With an eye-roll, Nao went on, “Alright, fine. 
Back during the Carnival, when you defeated me, you went on and on about how I had to be 
good at noticing things to survive. Beats me what it had to do with the situation, but it 
was true.</p><p>“So here’s one little thing I noticed: Since the Carnival, Tokiha and Sister 
Yukariko acted all regretful and stuff around me. They’ve both tried to make things up to me 
in their own ways, Tokiha by dragging me to all her karaoke parties so I’d be part of the 
group, and Sister Yukariko by ‘setting me on the right path’ and forcing me to start 
training to be a nun. Kuga was never very regretful about when she attacked, but given all 
that I put her through after that, I can’t say I blame her.</p><p>“You know what neither of 
them ever did though? They never apologized. They never admitted that their actions were in 
the wrong. It was like they wanted to hold out some justification for what they did, like 
that since I was the outsider, I had it all coming.” The wet spot on Nao’s face that Shizuru 
had noticed earlier had filled with a tear during Nao’s speech. She seemed to notice it now 
and wiped it away, glaring at Shizuru as if telling her to forget she saw that.</p><p>“But 
you apologized,” Nao continued. “It took you a few months, but you did. For that alone, I 
forgive you.”</p><p>Shizuru let her smile widen at this. <i>I knew you had a softer side to 
you, Nao-san. Natsuki was right, the two of you are quite similar, I just didn’t step in to 
help you as I did her.</i> “Thank you, Nao-san,” she said.</p><p>Nao gave a stiff nod, 
trying to maintain a hard look. “Just promise me a couple things,” she said. “First, tell no 
one of this, especially Kuga. She’d never let me live it down if she heard that I was 
talking like this.”</p><p>“Alright, I can do that,” Shizuru said. <i>Ara, one more thing I 
have to keep from Natsuki… at least this one isn’t about her.</i> She was careful to make 
sure she showed no sign of regret about this promise. She didn’t want Nao to doubt her 
sincerity. “What’s the other promise?”</p><p>“Don’t try to do me any favors,” Nao said. “I’m 
still suffering from the ‘favor’ Yukariko-temee is doing me. I don’t need any 
more.”</p><p>“If you insist,” Shizuru said, sighing inwardly. <i>I guess making reparations 
for Nao is off. Well, maybe I’ll be able to find a favor she won’t mind. Maybe even if she 
won’t appreciate it, it could still be worth it. Whether she likes Yukariko-san’s favor or 
not, it does appear to have softened her a bit.</i> Nao’s expression indicated that she was 
done, so Shizuru stood back up. “Thank you again, Nao-san,” she said. Nao grunted in 
acknowledgement and waved her off, so Shizuru took that as her cue to leave.</p><p><i>Well, 
that went a lot better than I expected. That just leaves Suzushiro-san to straighten things 
out with. I just wish I had a good idea of how I could approach her and have something other 
than a superficial conversation…</i></p><p>As if on cue, Shizuru’s cell phone started 
ringing. As she continued out of the church, she pulled it out of her pocket and checked the 
caller ID. Her eyes widened in surprise for a moment before she quickly covered it up. 
<i>Now that’s interesting. What could Suzushiro-san be calling me about? Maybe this’ll be 
easier than I thought as well, if she approaches me.</i></p><p>After exiting the church, 
Shizuru paused in her step and answered the phone. “Hel-“</p><p>“Fujino-me!” Shizuru jerked 
the phone away from her ear to protect her hearing from Haruka’s outburst. She’d long since 
gotten used to Haruka’s normal yelling, but she’d reached a whole new level here. “What did 
you say to Yukino? I know it was you who inflected her with your perverted 
ways!”</p><p>Shizuru was taken aback by the accusation. She’d expected Haruka to have some 
difficulty accepting this, but this was much worse than she’d anticipated. Somehow though, 
the absence of hearing Yukino chime in with “It’s ‘infected,’ Haruka-chan,” on the other end 
of the phone was the part of the exchange that stuck out most for Shizuru.</p><p>“Well? What 
do you have to say for yourself?” Haruka demanded, having received no immediate answer from 
Shizuru.</p><p><i>This is bad. What has Suzushiro-san said to Yukino-san? </i>Shizuru’s 
heart panged in sympathy for Yukino. She knew how it felt to have her love rejected, to have 
the object of her desire recoil at her touch. And now she’d been responsible for Yukino 
feeling that as well. She had to do something. She started walking off towards the girls’ 
dorm; Yukino might not want to see her, but she had to try.</p><p>“Please, Suzushiro-san,” 
Shizuru said, speaking on instinct as her mind tried to formulate a plan. “I hope you didn’t 
say such mean things to Yukino.”</p><p>“‘Yukino’?” If anything, her statement had managed to 
get Haruka even more enraged. “You’re talking about her in yobisute now? Just how close have 
the two of you gotten? I bet you’re taking advantage of her just like you did 
Kuga-san!”</p><p><i>Damn it, why did I slip like that? Am I sympathizing with her that much? 
</i>Shizuru fought to control her frustration and stop it from spilling onto her face as she 
started to walk through the more populated areas of the school grounds. <i>Even so, that was 
a low blow, Suzushiro-san.</i> “Yukino-san is a friend,” Shizuru said, barely keeping her 
anger out of her voice. “And I’m getting the feeling that you’ve just hurt her very 
badly.”</p><p>“<i>I</i> hurt her? You’re the one who put those perverted ideas in her 
head!”</p><p>“Those ideas were in her head long before I talked to her,” Shizuru said. She’d 
just reached the girls dormitory, so she decided she’d better end this soon, before seeing 
Yukino. “But I was the one who recommended she tell you about them. I was counting on you to 
be a bit more sensitive towards her feelings, but it turns out I was wrong. I guess I should 
go and try to make things up to Yukino-san.”</p><p>“What? You stay away from her you-” 
Shizuru switched off her phone in the middle of Haruka’s sentence and put it away. It went 
against all her carefully honed instincts to be so rude like that, but it was the best way 
to guarantee that Haruka would come rushing down to protect Yukino from her. She didn’t know 
how far away Haruka was, however, so it was probably still best to check on Yukino until she 
got there.</p><p>When Shizuru reached Yukino’s room, she paused for a moment to listen at 
the door. She didn’t hear any signs of life inside, which might have meant that Yukino was 
doing relatively fine, or she could have just been in her bedroom and out of earshot. 
Shizuru knocked out three precise beats on the door and waited for a reply.</p><p>After a 
few seconds, she heard footsteps coming up behind the door. They stopped for a bit, but the 
door didn’t open. As she heard them start to walk away, Shizuru took a quick glance down the 
hallway to make sure no one was around before calling through the door, “Yukino-san, please! 
I know what happened.”</p><p>The footsteps stopped as she spoke, and then resumed a moment 
after she finished. Shizuru let out a sigh of defeat. If Yukino didn’t want to see her, it 
was probably better to leave her alone. But as she was about to walk away, she heard the 
footsteps start to get louder again. They reached the door, and, after a moment of silence, 
it was unlocked and opened.</p><p>It took only a quick glance for Shizuru to ascertain that 
Yukino had been crying, though she would have assumed it even without the physical evidence 
her reddened eyes presented. “Forgive me, Yukino,” she said upon seeing her, and she 
followed this immediately by grasping her in a hug. She normally reserved such embraces for 
Natsuki, but this case merited an exception. She knew exactly how Yukino would be feeling 
right now, and though a hug wouldn’t take it all away, it was the best she could 
do.</p><p>Thankfully, Yukino seemed to accept the hug, even wrapping her own arms around 
Shizuru after a moment to pull the older girl in tighter. Shizuru had been afraid that 
Yukino would blame her for this – not without reason, as she had been wrong in predicting 
Haruka’s reaction – but fortunately that wasn’t the case. It would have been a lot harder to 
help her through this if Yukino wouldn’t let her in.</p><p>After a minute, Yukino pushed 
herself out of the hug. “We should get inside,” she said meekly, her eyes only briefly 
meeting Shizuru’s. Shizuru gave her a nod, though she wasn’t sure if Yukino noticed it, and 
followed her into the room. Yukino took a seat in the living space of the dorm, and Shizuru 
pulled around another chair to sit facing her.</p><p>“What did Suzushiro-san say to you?” 
Shizuru said. She tried to present her most sympathetic expression for Yukino, though the 
other girl wasn’t making much effort to look at her. Yukino had her gaze rooted firmly 
downward, and she seemed to be biting her lip, possibly in an effort to hold back 
tears.</p><p>“Nothing,” Yukino said after some time. “She said nothing. I poured my heart 
out to her, making it clear that I didn’t love her just as a friend, but she said nothing to 
me.” Yukino took a deep breath and wiped away some tears that had formed in her eyes. “She 
just sat there and stared at me. I watched as her expression changed painfully slowly from 
confusion into fear. When she was about as horrified as she could get, she bolted from the 
room, and I… I…” Yukino trailed off into sobs, but Shizuru could well imagine what her 
reaction was.</p><p>“Ara ara, I’m so sorry, Yukino-san,” she said, placing a supportive hand 
on Yukino’s knee and looking into her eyes in case she decided to return the eye contact. 
“That doesn’t sound like Suzushiro-san at all. I never would have expected her to react that 
way.”</p><p>“Neither did I,” Yukino said, finally looking up to face Shizuru. Her eyes 
showed deep pain, but there was a strength there which hadn’t yet crumbled, giving Shizuru 
hope that the girl would be able to make it through this. “I’ve never known Haruka-chan to 
be afraid of anything. For my feelings to scare her so much she couldn’t even talk to me…” 
Yukino bit her lip as she trailed off, her eyes pleading with Shizuru to finish the thought 
and give her some reason.</p><p>Shizuru shook her head. She only had one guess, but she 
wasn’t sure if she should speak it. If she were wrong again, it would just hurt Yukino more. 
It was probably just hopeful thinking on her part, too, thanks to the luck she’d been having 
with Natsuki. Still, it was the only thing she could think of. “Maybe,” she said, 
“Suzushiro-san was afraid of her own feelings. She’s been taught to think this kind of love 
is immoral and disgusting, so if she were to start feeling it herself, it could scare her 
quite a bit.”</p><p>Yukino gasped, and Shizuru watched hope fill her eyes, almost feeling 
guilty about it in fear that she might be wrong. “You mean, Haruka-chan…?”</p><p>“It’s the 
best guess I have, but I don’t know for sure,” Shizuru said. She gave Yukino an encouraging 
smile. “Even if it’s true, it still means things are going to be very 
diffic-”</p><p>“Yukino!” The door to Yukino’s dorm was blown open, possibly from the force 
of Haruka’s voice alone. “What is that bubuzuke-onna trying to do to you now?” Haruka 
demanded as she stormed into the room.</p><p>Yukino shot up from her chair. “Haruka-chan, 
no, she’s-”</p><p>“Ara, it’s alright, Yukino-san,” Shizuru interjected, rising from her 
seat. “I’ll leave the two of you alone for now. Don’t worry about me.” She met Yukino’s eyes 
once more and gave her another reassuring smile, and then turned to go. Haruka appeared to 
be trying to burn holes in Shizuru’s skull with her glare, but Shizuru simply met this with 
a passive smile.</p><p>As Shizuru reached the door, she paused in her step and turned back. 
“Oh, and Suzushiro-san? Don’t worry about Yukino-san too much. If you have to go, I’ll be 
right back here to take care of her.”</p><p>Haruka crossed her arms and growled at Shizuru. 
“Don’t count on it, Fujino.”</p><p>Shizuru gave a mock pout. When Haruka turned back around, 
Shizuru gave a quick wink at Yukino, who was currently trying to hold back a sigh at how 
easily Haruka was letting herself be manipulated. “Alright, goodbye for now then.”</p>
