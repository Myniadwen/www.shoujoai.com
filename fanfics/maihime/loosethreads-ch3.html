<h1>A Mai HiME Fiction: Loose Threads (part 3 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/arcajeth.html">Arca Jeth</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/loosethreads-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Yuuki Nao preferred nights like this. It was late and stillness 
blanketed the girls&#39; dorm. All of her noisy dorm mates had given up
their giggle-filled gossip sessions and gone to bed.

Even the birds ceased their jarring, atonal songs and turned in for the 
night. All that remained was the sound of the breeze flowing through 
the open window. Light from the full-moon showed through that window 
casting its pale brilliance upon her bed. 

Said moonlight also showered upon the lithe form lying there. A girl at 
or near Nao&#39;s age, but with smaller proportions lay facing away from 
her. The bed sheets were pulled down so Nao could trace the fine lines 
of her bare shoulders, the curve of her back, the slight rise of her 
posterior. 

Even if that last was hidden beneath the sheet, Nao found the outline 
alluring. Minagi Mikoto was a late bloomer, yet her blossoming promised 
to be most beautiful. The straight lines of her youthful body were 
slowly softening into more feminine curves. Her hips had become more 
pronounced, legs had grown longer and more toned. And while she&#39;d never 
be as well endowed as the freakishly top-heavy Tokiha woman, Nao found 
Mikoto&#39;s bust to be the perfect handful. 

&quot;How obscene of me!&quot; Nao laughed softly to herself. She&#39;d been doing a 
lot of that lately. Somehow just being around Mikoto made her feel 
better. Made her feel wanted. 

&quot;Is that what Tokiha get&#39;s from you?&quot; Nao asked the dozing girl. &quot;Is 
that what you want from her as well?&quot; 

Looking at the sleeping girl, Yuuki Nao was befuddled by Tokiha Mai&#39;s 
reluctance to accept Mikoto&#39;s feelings, or to even acknowledge them. 

Minagi Mikoto was such an interesting person. Much like the blade of a 
finely honed sword, she was strong and sharp, able to cut through most 
problems without much effort. Yet, if the blade were to strike an 
unyielding surface, its brittle edge would chip, its cutting power 
dulled. 

The feral girl had come to her one night, her edge chipped and broken on 
the unyielding stone of unrequited love. And Nao took her in, taking 
what pain she could from the girl.

Unable to resist the urge, Nao reached out and traced her fingers along 
the smaller girl&#39;s spine, pleased at the other&#39;s slight shiver and light 
hmmm, of recognition.

It would be so easy to love a girl like her. Mikoto loved all the way or 
not at all. On the surface it seems simple-minded of the girl, however 
&quot;all the way&quot; meant that she loved with her entire being. She would 
gladly trade her life for the ones she loved. But, since she expected 
nothing at all in return, she treated every sign of affection from 
others as a gift from Heaven.

Nao&#39;s hand returned to caress Mikoto&#39;s bare shoulder and wrapped her 
hand around it. 

Nao&#39;s grip tightened, her fingernails biting into the soft skin as she 
roughly turned the girl to face her. She descended upon Mikoto, more 
ravishing her lips than actually kissing them, forcing her tongue 
inside her mouth. 

Nao stifled a yelp of pain as a hand found her red hair and pulled 
sharply. She suddenly found herself on her back staring up at a pair 
of hungry, golden eyes.

Yes, it would be easy to love a girl like Minagi Mikoto. 

But love wasn&#39;t what Nao wanted.
