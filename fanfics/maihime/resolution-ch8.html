<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Been  here before / couldn’t say I liked it / where do I start writing  all this down? Just let me plunge you into my world / can’t you  help me be uncrazy? </em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It  comes alive and I / die a little more</em></span><em>

</em>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  unnamed feeling</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  Alder woke up a little painfully and found that he had been stashed  in a dumpster.  His head hurt a lot, and his radio was buzzing off  the proverbial hook.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minoru,  where the fuck are you?  If you’re hearing this, Minoru, respond  immediately. I repeat, respond <em>immediately.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Boy, </em>he thought in a daze as he observed with interest how trash had  actually collected a little bit over him, <em>Scratch-ass sure seems  panicked.  What’s eating him? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minoru,  where the fuck did you go?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Jesus,  can’t a sniper get a good night’s sleep anymore?</em> During the  Lazy Years he had actually gotten quite a bit of sleep, even on  assignments, because of how ridiculously easy they were towards the  end of the conflict. (There’ll be a guy shouting at <em>all of his  troops</em>, gathered at the center of the camp.  Yeah, even the  sentries.  Shoot him. He’ll be the one with the fluffy hat.) He  picked up the radio and thumbed the button, noting that it required a  lot more effort than was really necessary.  “Yeah?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was a pause, as though Scratch-ass couldn’t actually believe that  he was reporting in <em>now</em>, after all the work he’d gone  through to get Minoru to say something.  “Where the <em>fuck </em>have  you been?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  took a brief survey of his surroundings.  “It would appear,” he  said as he concluded, “that I’m in a dumpster.  In what is quite  possibly the only back-alley that this little shitpot of a tourist  trap has to offer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  would you like to tell me how you <em>got </em>there, exactly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Scratch-ass  calls me just after my mark goes into the lingerie store and tells me  to invite her to the beach house he specifies.  He tells me to use my  creativity.  I tell him I’m not exactly experienced in spywork,  which is why I’m a sniper and not a spy, because god damnit, you  get a lot more ass as a spy.  Or James Bond does, anyway. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I do  it anyway, using the ring that I … I do it anyway, and as I walk  outside, I see my mark by herself.  A couple of seconds later, my  radio buzzes and Scratch-ass tells me to get her out of there RIGHT  NOW. I briefly wonder where exactly he’s watching me from, and why  he needs me at all if he can see so clearly, but I start moving  anyway.  Before I get more than about five feet, I—</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  remembered the sharp pain in his side pretty intently when it bit at  him again as he tried to extract himself from the dumpster.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  don’t you tell me? You seem to be watching pretty intently from  wherever it is you are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Silence.   Minoru was suddenly angry.  He was a pretty mellow person as a rule,  and he hadn’t even minded going undercover even though he was <em>not </em>cut out for that sort of work, but god damnit, somebody had just  used a fucking <em>taser </em>on him.  Not only did that sting like a <em>bitch</em>, but god damnit, it was the principle of the thing. Like  he was some kind of rapist or something.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  fact,” he said, “I think you should tell me exactly what the <em>fuck </em>it is that I’ve gotten myself into before I go any further into  it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or  what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or…”  What <em>would </em>he do?  Would he leave? Absolutely. But then what  would he do after that? He thought of a thousand different things he  could say, and all of them sounded equally ridiculous; case in point: <em>Before I decide to walk right out of it and go home to my ex-wife  so that she can use </em>her <em>taser on me for violating the  restraining order. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or  nothing.”  He sighed.  “But tell me what I’m doing here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right  now, you are going after the people who have kidnapped your mark.  I  will tell you that you were watching her because we wanted her very  much alive and <em>un</em>kidnapped, preferably in our hands.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So  you wanted to be the ones to kidnap her first.  Good to know that  he’s got his priorities straight. </em>It didn’t particularly  bother Minoru; he more thought of it as ironic; but it was the kind  of ironic he wasn’t sure he wanted to be employed by.  It was the  stupid kind of ironic.  He knew perfectly well that there wasn’t  some mythicalbad-guy coalition that would ambush you from all  sides with a well-coordinated strike if you didn’t watch yourself;  that if you walked in a bad neighborhood, you were sometimes just as  likely to walk away unharmed because the people who were planning on  robbing and raping you were too busy trying to shoot each other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But he  also knew he wasn’t working for any of those people.  One of the  reasons the “bad-guys” didn’t have the kind of money it cost to  hire him was that they <em>didn’t</em> form a bad-guy coalition, give  it a spunky title, and try to unite all the gangs in New York to try  and take over the city.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>(Can  you dig it?) </em>Minoru thought, momentarily amused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  you want me to what? Go after them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something  like that. They have taken your backpack, but I don’t think they  know how to assemble the weapon inside of it; they’re nothing more  than locals with guns and the promise of money keeping them going;  taking care of them shouldn’t give you too much trouble.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  fucking planet are you from?” Minoru snapped. “I’m a <em>sniper</em>,  not a footslogger.  I don’t ‘take care’ of a big mob of people.  I ‘take care’ of their leader and then I ‘take care’ of a big  fat paycheck while the <em>real </em>footso’jers ‘take care’ of  the rest of them; do you get me?  If I tried to walk in there and  take the mark back, I don’t care if they were kids with popguns,  they would probably have my ass for lunch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was a frustrated sigh from the other end of his radio, which meant  that Scratch-ass wanted him to know he was getting angry.  Suddenly,  Minoru didn’t give a flying monkey turd. He was angrier than he’d  been in years.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you refuse this assignment, you know what will happen to you?”  Scratch-ass said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?  You’ll shoot me?” Minoru had a minor revelation. “Here’s an  idea, buddy.  How about taking that mythical guy who’s going to  shoot me, and using <em>him </em>to ‘take care’ of the local  yokels?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If we  did that,” Scratch-ass said, “Then who would we have around to  shoot <em>you</em> when you broke and ran?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  wanted to scream. Towards the end of the Sino-Russian conflict, this  was exactly the kind of logic that a lot of the Russian commanders  had employed; better to use their Commisars—talented soldiers,  all—to shoot fleeing or cowardly soldiers than to actually have  them fight. It lost them a lot of battles, cost a lot more lives that  were necessary, and had contributed in large part to their final  defeat and the loss of Russian Manchuria to the Chinese.  He had  actually been offered a job by one such Russian commander—whose  predecessor Minoru had killed, but he kept that part to himself—to  shoot his own troops if they broke formation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He had  accepted the job, because the money had been good and the risk was  roughly zero—the Chinese had spotted him, but when they saw who he  was targeting, they actually left him alone, even congratulated him  on a job well done—but he had thought it stupid the whole time,  dammit.  It had even shaken that underused moral compass of his  around a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And now,  for this stupid bastard to be here, doing the <em>exact. Same.  Thing...</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  he couldn’t exactly do anything about it.  He was now fairly well  convinced that there was a sniper following him, just itching to gun  him down if he ran off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine.  But get me a new gun.  I am not going into some barn or burned-out  apartment or whatever—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re  currently located in a residency.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t give a fuck if they’re holed up in the Taj freaking Majal.  I am not going wherever they are with only a pistol.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  didn’t intend that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You…what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Look  above you, please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  was being lowered from the rooftop.  He saw just the barest flash of  a black-gloved hand lowering that something down on a rope, and he  made a mental note of it. <em>Mental note: Kill other man in black. I  am the one true man in black.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  what is this?” he asked, genuinely interested.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Two  new weapons and some equipment that we came by during our…better  years.  Inside you will find a new sniper rifle equipped with an  infra-red scope, and a weapon of our own invention.  It assembles and  handles the same way as a minigun, however, so you should have no  trouble using it.” <strong>(A/N: A minigun is a semi-fictional weapon,  that is essentially a big machine gun, usually mounted on a  helicopter.  However, given the advanced nature of the world’s more  private organizations due to the occasional interference of the  former Searrs Foundation, I have taken the liberty of allowing  weapons such as this to be hand-held, braced on one’s torso for  use.)</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  say that like I know how to use one of those.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He did,  but damned if he was going to admit it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  have provided an adequate sniping location near the house; please be  sure not to kill the girl.  After you have picked off any targets  that you can, you will enter the house using the weapon we provided  you and clear it out; you will then escort the girl back to her  friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  what exactly are you planning on doing about the cops when they start  hearing big explosions in their quiet residential town?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All  of your weapons are silenced, and we have arranged for a distraction.  Is there anything else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  one more thing.  Tell me why you want this girl so bad, and if you  do, why you don’t just walk in and take her yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Our  police influence as of late has been rather…limited.”  He said it  like a rich man might say, <em>my caviar as of late has been  rather…low-quality, if I might say so. </em>Like he felt that he  was being deprived of a right.  “This distraction is about as much  as we can do for the time being; the plan you set in motion recently  is our method of, as you say, ‘walking in and taking her  ourselves’.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If  you think that after all this, that that girl is going to just walk  into some stranger’s house, you’ve got another thing coming,  mister. </em>But he kept that to himself; the longer this assignment  went on, the longer he got to brood over a sense of vengeance that  suddenly swept over him.<em> And maybe act on it, too. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  so after this is over, you want me to what? Just set her on the  ground and fly off into the sunset?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something  like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Bastard  completely misses the humor and he expects…god damnit</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  wondered what rank exactly Scratch-ass held within his  “organization.”  It couldn’t have been very high; his plans  didn’t seem to be working out so well as of late.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The bag  landed on his stomach and the black hand vanished, and his radio  clicked one more time:  “Go. You have no time to waste.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Ugh.</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Naturally,  of the three that had collapsed to the ground, Mikoto recovered  first: She was the one on top; she was the one with the eternal  wellspring of energy; and, of particular importance to Mai, she was  the one that was about to fucking die. She felt Mai shift her weight  upwards, preparing, maybe, to leap off of her again.  Before she  could do this, Mai grabbed the other girl about the waist and  squeezed, growling, “You’re not getting away <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">this </span></em>time,  Mikoto.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mikoto  giggled and screamed, and shifted her weight down onto Mai, who  smiled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tate  groaned in pain, feeling as though he was about to die.  “Could you  two lovebirds please get <em>off of me?</em>” he shouted, and then  covered his mouth in alarm.  He hadn’t meant to shout that loud,  and if the <em>crash </em>hadn’t brought their present situation to  the attention of the store owners, this certainly would.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">On the  plus side, the two girls rolled off of him immediately, easing the  pain on his scrotum considerably.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiho  peeked her head above the safety of her hands. Finding it safe, she  emerged from her shelter and, not seeing her shadow, decided all was  right in the world. Before anybody could say anything else, though,  the store owner, another old man in an apron, arrived with a look on  his face which gave Shiho cause to reconsider her decision.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  the <em>hell </em>are you kids doing?” he shouted angrily.  “Look  at this mess!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Everybody  but Mikoto had the grace to look sheepish. As to the cat-like girl,  blessedly ignorant of the verbal whupping-out-behind-the-shed, Mikoto  simply looked curious at the arrival of yet another person who  smelled like food.  She was rather hungry of a sudden.  (Or not of a  sudden, in all honesty).</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who’s  responsible for this?” The old man had a voice like moldy cabbage,  and what appeared to be a personality to match.  He was pointing with  one withered finger at the pile of noodles.  Nobody seemed to want to  say anything, so Mai shook her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I am,  sir.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  stopped, blinked.  “You are?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  sir.”  She bowed slightly.  “I’m very sorry; we weren’t  watching where we were going, and I accidentally ran into the  display.  We’re all very sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amazed  but certainly not rendered stupid, Tate and Shiho nodded in  agreement, bowing respectfully as well.  “If you’d like, I’ll  pick these up for you and re-arrange them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you kidding? Who wants to buy them now?” the owner snapped. “All  the noodles are probably all broken up and everything, all—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you kidding?” Tate burst out, “They’re <em>nood—</em>” Shiho  headbutted him in the side (lacking the height to elbow him properly  anywhere above the scrotum, which she was rather abject to just now),  hard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  say something?” the owner’s tone was positively venomous.  This  was not a man who would be easily swayed by cuteness or penance,  though it had thrown him off-guard for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nosir.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm. I  thought so, boy.  You kids will have to <em>work </em>this off, but  good. I don’t have another shipment coming in until tomorrow!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  the noodles are <em>fi</em>—” Another attempt at common sense,  another headbutt.  Harder, this time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  grinned like a celebrity’s wife in divorce court.  “I suppose so.   It’s a shame, too; we were hoping to go next door for sukiyaki  tonight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The old  man froze.  “What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  blinked as though she were surprised.  Which, of course, she was not.   “I’m sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  sir.  I was simply saying that I was hoping to go for sukiyaki  tonight, and I suppose we won’t be able to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  place closes late,” the owner countered, suddenly defensive and  nervous all at once.  “I won’t keep you until it closes, if  that’s what you mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  that’s not what I mean. I just mean that I suppose that they’ll  probably run out of noodles on a night like tonight, and then…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  then<em> what</em>?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  grinned at him.  “And then he’d have to use noodles that were all  broken up in his <em>cheapest sukiyaki in Goza</em>, which I still find  to be moderately expensive considering...” she looked at the  display.  “The sale on shirataki noodles.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was a customer in the doorway who had walked in halfway through the  conversation, and she was giving the store owner an odd look.  This  may have been because she was a sharp customer who had caught onto  what Mai was saying, or, more likely, it was because the old man with  chalky-white skin and a mean complexion suddenly resembled a beet  wearing an apron.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine,”  he spat after a moment. “Pick these up and get out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll  be buying one, first,” Mai said cheerfully.  “Mikoto here is  hungry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Make  that two.  Shiho is—” Another headbutt. Tate began to wonder if  Shiho wasn’t feeling so much of a bout of caution as a bout of  malice.  Also, he felt that his ribs were starting to bruise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Two,”  Mai said anyway.  “But we’ll get this cleaned up right away;  thanks very much!” She gave him her most winning smile and bowed  one more time, and he stalked off sourly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When he  was gone, they wordlessly rebuilt the display, taking two boxes of  noodles for themselves.  Tate could only stare at Mai in a little bit  of awe.  “That was…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Beautifully  handled?” Mai smiled.  “Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, I  meant, that was…” Tate couldn’t think of a word to describe  what that was.  What that was <em>right then. </em>What she was.  “That  was…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That was  yet another headbutt.  With the owner gone, Tate rounded on Shiho  angrily.  “Would you <em>knock it off?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you could stop drooling over Mai for two seconds, maybe I wouldn’t <em>have </em>to in the first place,” she shot back, taking him  off-guard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  colored a little and Tate’s face turned into something awful and  ugly for a moment; something very, very angry.  Shiho’s did the  same in return.  They stared at each other for a solid minute, and  Mai found herself forced to look away, feeling<br />
      <em>Tate  is so kind</em><br />
  as  though she had done something fundamentally wrong, and at the same  time feeling angry enough to smack Shiho.  She wanted to ask her in  that instant what the fuck her problem was, but she knew the answer  already, and she wasn’t sure she could bear to hear it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come  on, Mikoto,” Mai said quietly.  “We should go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mikoto  looked between the two of them—Tate and Mai—a little askew, as  though she were confused.  Tate looked as though he wanted to say  something, and Shiho just looked satisfied.  None of them, however,  did anything about any of this. What followed was an extremely  awkward moment in which Mai felt her heat sinking down into her right  calf, followed by another; finally, after about thirty of these  awkward moments, Mai simply walked off towards the registers  wordlessly.   Mikoto gave Shiho a curious look and then scampered off  after Mai.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">By the  time Mikoto caught up to Mai, she had finished paying and was on her  way out the door.  The two said nothing to each other; Mikoto walked  behind Mai like a puppy as Mai directed herself calmly around the  corner of the store, around again, until they were in back, where  there was a small field of grass that would have been a parking lot  in Tokyo or Kyoto.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As soon  as they were out of the street’s sightline, Mai collapsed on her  butt and Mikoto, sensing what was coming, leapt onto her, asking  nothing and demanding nothing in return, and Mai wrapped her arms  around Mikoto and cried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After a  while, it subsided, and Mai spoke into Mikoto’s damp shirt, “Why  can’t he just tell her to back off? Why can’t he just…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because,”  Mikoto said with an air of perfect understanding, “if he did that,  then she would be by herself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Tate  is so kind</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  can’t she find herself some other fuh-fuh-fucking plaything?” Mai  whispered back, bitterly, still hiccoughing. “I hate that little…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  Mikoto murmured.  “No, you don’t. You envy her, but you  shouldn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you know,” Mai said morosely, less a question than a statement.  Mikoto didn’t take it personally.  She just held Mai while the  girl, weakened from<br />
      <em>death</em><br />
  her  lack of sleep and, maybe, worn out from fighting long after the fight  was over, cried.  And she never wondered once how Mikoto knew so well  exactly what was going on, how she had displayed a wisdom that Mai  had previously thought only Chie possessed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  truth, the answer was far too simple to be pondered anyway.  Somebody  once said that love makes us all fools, but that was only half true.  The other half, the half that that stupid bastard left out, is that  love also makes us wiser than any philosopher.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even if  it only was with regards to the ones we love.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It took  them a while after that, but they made it to their feet, and Mikoto  suggested to Mai that they go find Tate and Shiho, and Mai agreed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  current is changing, </em>Mai thought again. <em>It hurts to change;  it erodes a lot of our walls as it does, but it changes nonetheless,  and then life is better for us.</em></span></p>

Shizuru  wasn’t hurt, but she wasn’t happy, either.  She was dressed in a  skirt and a blouse, and she was tied to a chair inside a dark, dingy  house that obviously belonged to a bunch of males: Unfurnished and  dirty in those certain areas designated to be dirty, and only  moderately acceptable anywhere else.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  males, though, were not rough.  No, they looked desperate, maybe, but  not rough.  They had treated her gently, and told her that they  weren’t planning on hurting her, but that they couldn’t tell her  what was going to happen to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  reeked of the kind of poverty that won’t starve a man but rather,  will drive him insane: The kind of poverty that one has only known  since the beginning of a recession. The kind that makes him speak of <em>the better days</em>, and <em>back in the day</em> with the same kind  of wistfulness one might have when looking back on a tryst with a  model.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She felt  sorry for all of them, but that didn’t displace her fear that they  knew exactly what was going to happen to her, and she was frightened  that she was going to die for it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Natsuki…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  still, she felt more than anything, pain in her heart. <em>Obsession  is a dangerous thing, Shizuru, </em>somebody had once told her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She had  ignored that person.</span></p>

Reito  grimaced as Midori walked out of the bar, not staggering yet but  certainly not entirely sober, and after a moment, he followed her  out, not bothering to pay for his coffee. The bartender had vanished  somewhere and if Reito listened closely, which he did, he could hear  a woman moaning through the walls.  This suggested either pornography  or a tryst, and Reito was more inclined to believe the former.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  then, Reito was also a closet cynic.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  emerged onto the bright sidewalk, started off without any sort of  thought towards the next bar, having more or less rejected the last,  and after a moment Reito followed her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">His  cover was nearly perfect: He was quite adept at hiding himself when  the need arose, and with Midori in the state she was in, (though he  wasn’t entirely sure what that state was, yet; she hadn’t had  that much to drink, and yet she walked with the sorrowful purpose of  a career drunk) she would probably never notice him.  It almost could  have worked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That is,  it almost could have worked if Natsuki hadn’t shouted out his name  with a kind of desperation as she dashed down the street at him.  A  moment later, she shouted, Midori’s, and that was the end of his  cover.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  both turned to face her, and Reito was taken off-guard at how fast  she was sprinting.  When she came into full view, he was even more  surprised by the look on her face: She looked both scared and near to  frustrated, to the point where she was near to tears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  gave Reito an evil look as she caught onto what he’d been doing,  but she seemed to have sobered or snapped out of it or overcome  whatever had been eating at her for the time being.  “Jesus,” she  said as Natsuki stopped in front of them, panting a little.  “What  is it, Natsuki?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  approached just in time to hear her say this:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shizuru  is gone,” she said, and as if that didn’t stop Reito’s heart  halfway, the next thing did: “And I need you to drive me back to  the cabin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For  what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  took a deep breath, which could have just as easily been because she  was a little winded as for the dramatic pause it entailed.  “I’m  going to get my gun.”</span></p>
