It was time to set my  plan into motion.
<p>I’ve always been  considered a tactician of sorts. I <em>“had a way with words” </em>as  one individual put it, and considering my background, it wasn’t any  real surprise that I had this talent. I belonged to a powerful  family, I was willing to admit that. We simply got what we wanted, no  questions asked, and when we didn’t, we worked our ‘Fujino magic’  and got it anyway. That’s simply how it had always been, and even  though my father had passed on and I was away from home, it didn’t  mean that it was going to change.</p>
<p>Over the years I had  worked on crafting my art, I came to learn my trump cards and how to  properly play them. Like I said before, my words were certainly one  of them. I had a relatively large vocabulary, and I had a knack for  precisely choosing the right words at the right time to work my way  around any obstacles in my path. The proper words accompanied by my<em>‘sweet and innocent’ </em>Kyoto accent were hitting the nail on  the head, so to speak.</p>
<p>Another gift I  possessed was my quiet patience. I came to discover that, in more  cases than none, I had this in abundance. Sometimes when you played  the game you had to wait before you would see the fruits of your  labor. It took a little more time to learn this, but when I finally  did, I found that I profited greatly.</p>
<p>The final hand to play  was my own beauty. Not that I’m trying to boast, I’m simply  stating what I’ve been told and have observed first hand over the  years. And as I’ve gotten older, I’ve found that this card just  might be the strongest of them all, especially when it comes to men.  I do, however, have very specific limits on how far I take things.  I’ll use it to my advantage, but I will in no way use it to be  taken advantage of. I was no common whore; that would just be  distasteful and disrespectful towards myself.</p>
<p>With these three things  alone, I could usually turn any situation to my advantage.  Manipulative capabilities one might call them, but personally, I  thought that sounded a little…harsh. Either way, I wasn’t one to  waste god-given talent, so I went right ahead with my plan.</p>
<p>It was a Monday morning  and I was currently seated in the student council room. Since my  second period was a study session, I often came down to the room to  work on things related to the council or simply to be able to do my  schoolwork in privacy. Today, however, would be dealing with the  former. I had summoned Miss Yukino Kikukawa, a first year student who  had been elected to the council, to the room a few minutes earlier  and was attentively waiting for her arrival. It wasn’t long before  I heard her soft footsteps stop at the door.</p>
<p>“U-um…”</p>
<p>“Ah, Miss Kikukawa,  please come in.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes, Fujino  Kaichou.”</p>
<p>I watched as the short,  messy-haired brunette quietly stepped into the student council room,  head tilted down, hazel eyes occasionally peeking over the top of the  slim glasses resting on her nose.</p>
<p>I simply smiled at the  mousey girl as I stood, “Please, take a seat.”</p>
<p>The girl complied,  still looking as shy as ever as she sat at one of the empty tables,  and once she was settled, I did the same.</p>
<p>“You are the new  secretary of the student council, correct Kikukawa-san?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes.”</p>
<p>“You do know all the  responsibilities of your position, yes?”</p>
<p>“Mmh.”</p>
<p>“And you know of the  time and dedication that is required with being on the council?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I trust you’ll be  a diligent worker…even if you aren’t working for Miss Suzushiro?”</p>
<p>This obviously captured  her attention, causing the girl to look straight at me for the first  time since she had entered the room.</p>
<p>“Ara, do not look so  surprised. Most of the students here at Fuuka know of your and  Suzushiro-san’s friendship. Am I out of line assuming that the two  of you were hoping to work together on the council?”</p>
<p>“…N-no, Kaichou…”</p>
<p>“It seems that my  being elected as president has ruined that, ne?”</p>
<p>Silence took over as  Yukino averted her eyes away from me.</p>
<p>I let out an amused  little sigh before continuing, “I had no intension of pulling the  two of you apart…and I still don’t…”</p>
<p>“Miss Fuji—“</p>
<p>“I called you here  today to ask your opinion on the course of action I intend to take.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes?”</p>
<p>“How would you feel  if I made Miss Suzushiro my executive director?”</p>
<p>The short girl’s face  immediately brightened, “Haruka-chan as…executive director…?”</p>
<p>“Yes, do you think  she would accept?”</p>
<p>“I…I can’t be for  certain, but…”</p>
<p>Picking up the phone on  my desk, I slipped the receiver beneath my hair and onto my ear,  “Shall I call her down here then?”</p>
<p>Yukino nodded silently,  a small smile evident on her freckled face.</p>
<p>A few minutes passed  before the blonde in question arrived. She made her presence known as  she stormed down the hallway, sliding the door to the room open in  one violent heave once she had reached the room.</p>
<p>“Fujino! What did you  call me down here—Yukino?”</p>
<p>“Suzushiro-san,  please come in, I have something to discuss with you.”</p>
<p>A glare, “If this is  about the election…”</p>
<p>Deciding to get this  over with as quickly as possible, I cut right down to the chase,  “Somewhat, yes. I want to place you as the executive director of  the student council.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“What do you say?”</p>
<p>Violet embers observed  me warily before turning to the quiet brunette seated at the table. I  noticed them soften as they turned away from me onto the younger  girl.</p>
<p>“What is this about,  Yukino?”</p>
<p>“Fujino Kaichou would  like you on the council, Haruka-chan.”</p>
<p>Blonde strands glided  through the air as Haruka snapped her head back around to look at me,  “Is this some kind of joke?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m quite  serious.”</p>
<p>Suzushiro cocked a  golden eyebrow at me, “And why would you do that?”</p>
<p>“Apparently many of  the students at this school do not believe that you could fulfill the  role as Seitokaichou,” I began, the girl before me immediately  starting to fume. Yukino even seemed to tense up at my words.</p>
<p>Ignoring this for the  moment, I continued, “However, I beg to differ.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I believe that you  are a hard worker, Suzushiro-san. Someone with your determination and  dedication would be greatly appreciated on the council. Not only  that, but it will also give you a chance to prove those who doubt  your abilities wrong, will it not?”</p>
<p>Haruka stood silently  for a moment, obviously processing what I’d just told her. I took  this opportunity to continue my proposal, hoping to seal the deal if  I hadn’t already.</p>
<p>“If you were to take  the position, you would be handling some of the most important tasks  of the council, and inevitably, I would most likely place  Kikukawa-san under your disposal. An assistant of sorts, if you will.  It’s already been approved by the director, it is completely up to  you now.”</p>
<p>This certainly sparked  a reaction in both girls. They looked at one another momentarily,  conversing with only their eyes before Haruka responded, her usual  overly confident tone returning, “Alright, I’ll do it!”</p>
<p>“I’m glad.”</p>
<p>“But don’t get me  wrong, Fujino. I’m not doing this for you, I’m doing it for the  good of the school.”</p>
<p>I nodded, “Please do  your best.”</p>
<p>“Of course! Like I  could do anything otherwise.”</p>
<p>“Well then, the two  of you are free to return to your classes. I’ll see you this  afternoon at the meeting,” I state while standing from my seat.</p>
<p>“Right. Yukino! Let’s  go!”</p>
<p>“Mmh.”</p>
<p>I watched as Suzushiro  paraded out of the room, Yukino close on her heels, only pausing to  quickly bow to me before disappearing after her friend.</p>
<p>After retrieving my  bag, I left my position behind the desk. Walking out the door, I  stopped to lock it behind me before heading to my own classroom, an  accomplished grin spreading across my face.</p>
<p>W<em>ell, that went smoothly. The students might not like it, but with  Suzushiro-san on board my workload should be considerably reduced…See  Natsuki? Like I told you, it’s no trouble at all.</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>I can’t let them  gather all the Hime in this place.</em>
<p>That was my final  conclusion after the meeting with the Rijichou, Kazahana Mashiro. The  wheelchair-bound girl couldn’t have even been in her teens yet…so  how could she be the director of an entire school? That was the first  spark of suspicion. Then there was the oddly mature way she talked  about the Hime and the First District…How was it that she knew  about all of that?</p>
<p>On top of that, the  director had openly asked me to fight the Orphans that continued to  appear on campus. Duran and I had been doing just that over the past  couple of months. Some were easier to defeat than others and some had  nearly killed me. It was scary at times, but I always managed to pull  through. But was this the reason the First District were gathering  the Hime at Fuuka? Was it solely to fight these creatures? No…that  couldn’t be the case. Why would they be so discreet about bringing  us here then? Why couldn’t they just come out and say it if that  was the real purpose?</p>
<p>Surely there had to be  another reason. I could feel it. Something wasn’t right, and I was  damn determined to figure out the truth.</p>
<p>But why should I risk  myself for these other people? I was no savior…I wasn’t even  entirely sure what would happen if we were all gathered here. The  feeling in the pit of my stomach drove me onward though. Women’s  intuition perhaps? You might call it that…or maybe I was just  petrified of what might happen if I <em>didn’t</em> do something.</p>
<p>It was soon after my  talking with the school director that I happened to hear about  another transfer student coming to Fuuka Academy. How was I to know  if this individual was a Hime? I had never met them before. I  couldn’t be for certain, but considering the fact that they were  coming <em>after</em> the first term had already started definitely  shot up the red flag in my mind. There was only one way to find out  for sure, but to do that would require a little more information, and  needless to say, I headed to my number one source immediately.</p>
<p>“Hey, are you using  your computer right now?” I asked as I let myself into the student  council room. Lucky for me, Shizuru was the only one inside.</p>
<p>“Not at the moment,”  the brunette replied as she began to stand from her seat at the desk.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to  get up, it’ll only take a second,” I told her, turning the small  laptop in my direction as I quickly began pecking away at the  keyboard.</p>
<p>Shizuru eyed me  curiously, taking a break from the paperwork she had been working on  previously, “I guess that means you found some more information  then?”</p>
<p>“More like I heard a  rumor…”</p>
<p>“…Are you always so  thorough?”</p>
<p>“When it comes to  this, yes.”</p>
<p>The girl beside me let  out a small sigh, “Ara, now if we could only get Natsuki to be this  dedicated to attending her classes…It has only been the first month  of school and you’ve already missed quite a few days.”</p>
<p>My face twisted into an  expression that blatantly said ‘whatever’ as I continued  searching, “That can’t be helped. Besides, I’m still passing  all my classes, but I’m sure you know that as well, Miss Kaichou.”</p>
<p>“Well, it is part of  my job to keep up with the students, but even if it were not, I would  still keep a close eye on you.”</p>
<p>I ignored Shizuru’s  teasing for the moment as the screen I’d been diligently looking  for finally popped up displaying the information that I had been  seeking.</p>
<p>“Mmh…so it is  true…” I mumbled, quickly scanning it over.</p>
<p>I noticed my  crimson-eyed friend nonchalantly lean over to try to sneak a peek at  what I was reading, but having received the information I needed, I  quickly closed the window, the screen returning to the desktop.  Shizuru squinted her eyes at me, but I pretended not to notice.</p>
<p>“Alright, well, I’m  off. Sorry to bother you.”</p>
<p>“How many times do I  have to tell you that it’s not any trouble?”</p>
<p>“We’ll see how long  that lasts,” I quickly responded with a smirk as I walked out the  door.</p>
<p>Making my way out of  the building, I headed to the back of the school where a certain  teacher liked to keep his private garden. I had confirmed that a  young girl was indeed transferring to the Fuuka middle school, now I  needed to see if she was a Hime or not.</p>
<p>I quietly slipped into  my usual place, leaning against a nearby tree, while remaining out of  sight, “So there’s one being transferred here, huh?”</p>
<p>I heard Sakomizu make a  small guttural noise before he spoke, “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Don’t play dumb.”</p>
<p>A defeated sigh, “That  was faster than I expected…not bad Kuga-san.”</p>
<p><em>So she </em><em><strong>is</strong></em><em> a Hime… </em></p>
<p>“Your people must be  getting lazy, either that or there are more snitches like yourself  out there. Although I doubt too many of them have afros…”</p>
<p>The man coughed at my  last statement causing me to smirk before I continued, “So, are we  doing this the easy way, or the hard way?”</p>
<p>“That depends on what  you’re wanting to know.”</p>
<p>“When is this Minagi  Mikoto supposed to be arriving? And how?” I bluntly questioned.</p>
<p>“Do you plan to  prevent her from coming here?”</p>
<p>I shrugged despite the  fact that he couldn’t see the action, “Who knows.”</p>
<p>There was a deadly  silence that followed, and I could practically hear the gears in his  head turning, but eventually Sakomizu spoke.</p>
<p>“May 2nd…she  should be arriving from the mainland to the school grounds by car  around three o’clock if everything proceeds smoothly.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“You’d better not  cause too many problems, Kuga-san,” the man cut me off, “If the  higher-ups ever find out…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, I know,  you’re dead. Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“You make it sound  like my life is nothing important….”</p>
<p>“Maybe it isn’t,”  I concluded as I ran off into the woods to find my bike.</p>
<p>On my way, I whipped  out my cell, quickly flipping it open before I dialed.</p>
<p>“Yamada. It’s me. Meet at the usual in twenty minutes, I’m  going to need your help…”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“…That’s the  car…?”
<p>“Yes. The number’s  the same too. There’s no doubt.”</p>
<p>Several days had passed  since I had confirmed the arrival of what I believed to be another  Hime to Fuuka Academy. Now I was currently clad in my biker suit  standing on the massive bridge that connected the area to the  mainland, Yamada beside me looking through his binoculars, both of us  watching the car that was slowly approaching us.</p>
<p>As I remained staring,  the man pulled his binoculars away and turned to me before  continuing, “Are you really going to do this? Either way you turn  it, it’s still a crime.”</p>
<p>“Who cares. I’m not  paying you to be my babysitter, Yamada. Go on as planned,” I curtly  answered.</p>
<p>“Alright…Remind me  never to piss you off,” came the reply laced with a little sarcasm.</p>
<p>“Speaking of, I’ll  be rather upset if you or your man messes this up,” I retorted,  finally breaking my gaze from the car to stride over to my bike.</p>
<p>Yamada raised his hands  defensively before his phone began to ring. He retrieved the object  from one of his vest pockets and placed it to his ear, mumbling a few  understandings before hanging up, “We’ve completed re-routing all  other cars. There’s no obstacle for around three hundred meters.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Straddling my  magnificent vehicle, I twisted the accelerator and my bike jumped to  life with a loud roar before I took off. As I sped closer and closer,  I took over the steering with my right hand as I materialized my  element in my left. For most people this stunt would have been quite  impossible, but you have to understand that since my awakening I had  participated in more battles than I could remember. They kept piling  up, and as a result, my abilities became more and more refined. The  gun in my hand right now, it felt like an extension of my own body,  and because of this I was able to hit my targets with pinpoint  accuracy…even when driving my motorcycle at full speed.</p>
<p><em>This might be a  gamble, but here goes nothing.</em></p>
<p>The car passed by.</p>
<p>I pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>Hot metal shredded  through rubber causing a loud popping sound that was heard over both  engines before the car skidded, slipped onto its side, and eventually  came to a rest several meters away. The sound of screeching tires  erupted as I quickly whipped my bike around. I placed my feet on the  ground as I stared at the overturned car. Numerous seconds ticked by  before I detected movement, and sure enough, a small figure slowly  emerged from the wreckage.</p>
<p><em>Blue sailor suit.  Definitely a student…Minagi Mikoto perhaps? And maybe a Hime as  well…</em></p>
<p>That premonition was  instantly turned into a cold hard fact. The small girl, although  frail in stature, was gripping a sword that, including the hilt, is  taller than she was. But not only that, there also seemed to be a  lust for battle in her eyes.</p>
<p><em>Awakened already?!  Sakomizu seems to have forgotten to mention that…</em></p>
<p>I clicked my tongue as  an amused little smile graced my face.</p>
<p><em>Too late to turn  back now.</em></p>
<p>I raised my gun at the  girl before me, choosing not to summon the other for the time being  as we stood staring at each other in complete silence, her golden  eyes meeting mine without any fear.</p>
<p>“Minagi Mikoto I  presume?”</p>
<p>The messy haired girl  chose to just snarl at me for a reply.</p>
<p>“I know that you’re  being transferred to Fuuka Academy. I’m here to prevent that from  happening. It’s for your best—!“</p>
<p>Before I could finish,  I was quickly cut off, and I mean <em>literally</em> cut off, by the  girl charging at me, aiming her giant sword at my skull. I barely  rolled out of the way just in the nick of time, but I think she might  have managed to steal a few of my hairs with the strike.</p>
<p><em>Damn! That thing  doesn’t even slow her down!</em></p>
<p>“Stop it! I don’t  want to fight you!”</p>
<p>There was no point in  trying to talk. The girl spun around, dragging the sword in a circle  before she abruptly stopped and planted the thing into the ground  with little effort. I heard the concrete crack, but I was too  preoccupied by the large spikes that were rapidly erupting towards me  in succession. I dodged them for the most part, but a few of them did  knock into me. I somehow managed to stay upright despite the blows,  but my assailant was quick to counterattack. The girl wildly lunged  at me, bloodlust in her eyes. I tried to steer clear, but the end of  her blade managed to catch my arm. I hiss as the leather of my suit  and the tissue beneath slit open, red liquid spraying from the gash.  To buy myself some time, I fired off a round of energy blasts in her  direction, however, Minagi displayed here inhuman agility yet again  as she jumped away from all of my attempts, even with the large  weapon still in her hands.</p>
<p><em>This is my chance!</em></p>
<p>Charging towards the  girl, I summoned my second gun into my right hand, rapidly firing off  rounds from both arms. The girl used her sword as a shield this time,  hiding behind its wide blade that provided her good cover, but she  also took her eyes off of me in doing so. Once I was close enough, I  ceased fire, and in one powerful leap, I launched myself off the  ground, kicking the blade with both heels. I landed hard on my  stomach, but the sound of a fading scream that reached my ears took  my attention away from the pain. I scrambled to the edge of the  bridge just in time to see the girl disappear into the deep blue  below.</p>
<p>“Tch, damn it…” I  cursed, my breathing still quite heavy.</p>
<p><em>There’s no way  that killed her. I know it…Either way I’m going to need a boat…</em></p>
<p>Reaching for my pocket,  I pulled out my cell and dialed Yamada’s number while I hastily  walked over to my bike that was now lying on its side.</p>
<p>“She got away from  me. Meet at the docks in ten minutes.”</p>
<p>Before he can even begin to reply I hung up, placing my phone back  into my pocket before pulling my motorcycle off the ground, jumping  on, and zooming off to my proposed destination.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
It was already past six  and I was just now walking home from school. The student council  meeting had run slightly longer than usual, mainly because  Suzushiro-san wouldn’t stop complaining about everything that  wasn’t <em>exactly</em> perfect in the school and informing us on how  she planned to fix it all. After the rest of the council had left, I  remained a while longer to finish up some work before finally heading  out. I had just started to make my way down the main walk leading up  to the school, when an eerie voice emerged from the line of trees to  my right.
<p>“Good evening,  Shizuru-chan.”</p>
<p>I froze, stopping dead  in my tracks, turning my head towards the source.</p>
<p>“Is someone there?”  I questioned the darkness while maintaining my calm demeanor.</p>
<p>Soon a young boy became  visible, a sly gleam in his oddly pink eyes, “Pretty girls really  shouldn’t be strolling about by themselves once the sun has gone  down.”</p>
<p>I didn’t like the  sound of his tone and decided to answer with equal sarcasm, “Neither  should little boys. Are you a student here?”</p>
<p>“Now, now,  Shizuru-chan, this is about you, not me. But before we get started,  how about some proper introductions? I am Homura Nagi, it’s a  pleasure to meet you Miss Kaichou.”</p>
<p>The pale-haired boy  bowed to me, but I made no move to return the greeting as I remained  completely silent. Taking note of my lack of response, he continued,  “Shall we get down to the matter at hand?”</p>
<p>Suddenly the boy  pointed straight up at the sky. I followed the direction of his  gesture with my eyes and was surprised to see a red speck in the sky  glowing right beside the moon.</p>
<p>“That is the Hime  Star.”</p>
<p>“Hime…star…?</p>
<p><em>Where did that come  from?</em></p>
<p>“Surely you’ve seen  the shape before? The mark on your left side perhaps?”</p>
<p>My mask cracked  somewhat as a small gasp slipped passed my lips, my hand immediately  covering the aforementioned spot that began to throb in a rhythmic  pulse of pain.</p>
<p><em>Why is it…so warm?</em></p>
<p>“Ah, so you do  know…That is your Hime mark. Only the ones who have a mark like you  do can see the Hime Star. Not only that, but only those with the Hime  mark are capable of summoning elements.”</p>
<p>“Elements? What are  you saying?”</p>
<p>The boy leered at me  while waving his fingers, “Your hands are feeling a little…numb,  are they not?”</p>
<p>As soon as he said  this, I did notice an oddly cold feeling sweeping through my palms.  That sensation was quickly replaced with a burning tingling that felt  as if someone was lightly pricking my skin with a handful of needles  over and over.</p>
<p>“Wha-what…?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, an inhuman  cry burst from behind me. I jerked my body around to see a shadow  creature hovering before me, a single pair of golden eyes meeting my  own, staring me down. Those two eyes quickly multiplied to four, six,  eight…twelve in all as what appears to be serpent-like tentacles  spread out from the main body of the monster. Another larger set of  golden eyes opened further back in the distance making fourteen in  all.</p>
<p>“You’d better  hurry, Shizuru-chan. Summon your element, just concentrate.”</p>
<p>Feeling like I had no  other choice, I followed Nagi’s instructions, setting my mind on  the warmth in the center of my palms. It began to grow as I  concentrated further, and moments later a bright light erupted. Cool  metal materialized in my hands, and I gripped onto the pole that shot  out in either direction. The light of the moon gleamed off the blade  that formed at one of its ends.</p>
<p><em>A naginata?!</em></p>
<p>“Wooh…good job,  Shizuru-chan. Here they come!”</p>
<p>Snapping my gaze from  the weapon that has just appeared in my hands, I watched as the  serpent like bodies wavered back and forth, thin tongues tasting the  night air, before they all at once came striking toward me at full  speed.</p>
<p>And oddly enough, I was  not the least bit afraid.</p>
<p>Time seemed to slow as  I closed my eyes. My grip on the weapon tightened as some unknown  voice inside of me told me there is more to the object I was holding  than meets the eye. I slid my right hand down the pole closer to the  blade, holding the naginata the proper way, the way I had been taught  when I was younger. The memories of those lessons flooded my mind.</p>
<p><em>Downward slash  across the body. Back. Snap the wrist.</em></p>
<p>The sound like a chain  being rapidly unfurled echoed in my ears followed by the clanking of  metal against metal. The creature released another cry, one more out  of shock than pain. Opening my eyes, I see the whip that had extended  from the blade of my naginata and was now wrapped around the necks  off all six snakes, drawing them together in a tangled mess. I jerked  the weapon towards me, tightening the grip on the serpents that hiss  their discontent.</p>
<p>“Amazing! And it’s  your first time too, you truly are amazing, Shizuru-chan!” Nagi  proclaimed as he miraculously appeared in one of the nearby trees.</p>
<p>Ignoring the boy, I  continued to stare at the monster in my captivity, my body shifting  slightly as the things squirmed in an attempt to break free.</p>
<p>“This is your child,  Kiyohime. No matter what your goal is, this child will become a  strong ally, but keep in mind that if you do decide to accept her  that you must wager your most precious thing in return.”</p>
<p><em>My life…for this  creature? You could be useful though…</em></p>
<p>Keeping a steady grip  on my weapon, I began to advance closer to the shadow-creature. When  I was close enough, I pulled my weapon back, forcing the snakes down  to my eye level.</p>
<p>Crimson met amber  before I spoke, my tone quiet and deathly serious, “We only have  one purpose…and that is to protect Natsuki. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>All six serpents hissed  in unison, and in turn, I released my hold on them, the whip quickly  reforming into the blade at the end of my naginata.</p>
<p>“Good. You and I, we  work together now…Kiyohime.”</p>
<p>As the snakes formed a  circle around me with their bodies, a bright light beamed from the  ground beneath us. I blocked my eyes with my arm, and once it had  faded back to darkness, I notice that Kiyohime was no longer a  shadow, but instead a deep shade of purple. It also became quite  clear that she was some kind of…monster squid, almost resembling a  hydra of sorts. One thing for sure, however, was that she was quite  massive in size.</p>
<p>“Congratulations,  Shizuru-chan.”</p>
<p>Snapping my head  around, I whipped my naginata in Nagi’s direction in one fluid  motion, the whip extending to wrap around the boy’s small frame  several times. He yelped as I pulled tighter, violently yanking him  from the tree. I glared down at him with my blood-red orbs as he  pulled himself up onto his knees, daring to timidly look up at me.</p>
<p>“Do not call me  ‘chan’ anymore.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes…<em>Fujino-san</em>…”  the boy weakly replied.</p>
<p>I released him, and he  was quick to disappear, mumbling something about ‘powerful’ and  ‘scary’ that I couldn’t completely make out.</p>
<p>Turing my attention  away from Nagi, one of the serpents approached me, and I stretched  out my hand, letting the thing smell me with its tongue before I pet  its muzzle.</p>
<p><em>With you at my side surely…surely I will be able to keep my  Natsuki safe.</em></p>
