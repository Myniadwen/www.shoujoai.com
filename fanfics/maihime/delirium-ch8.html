<p>Manga notes:<br />
  <br />
  -In the beginning of the manga, Mai and Natsuki  were rivals? Bitter enemies? Anyway, they were fighting for some petty  reason or another and then new student Taters somehow got caught in  between and became both of their Keys. <br />
  -I think I explained some of the discrepancies in the fic. Otherwise, just ask me. Not thinking now.<br />
  <br />
  Other stuff:<br />
  <br />
  -The  story of Kiyohime I used is basically all the different versions I've  read over the 'net mixed into one. So like...uber Kiyohime? Therefore,  if some stuff I mention about her is slightly different from what  you've heard, that's why. <br />
  <br />
  ----------<br />
  <br />
  The weather was nice today,  Natsuki decided as she stared into the light blue sky filled with wispy  clouds. For a summer morning, it was rather cool—perfect in her  opinion. <br />
  <br />
  She sat on the steps at the entrance of her home; her  helmet was cradled in her lap. Her eyes glanced forward to where her  haphazardly parked bike had dangerously skidded to a stop at the edge  of the tiny flower bed near the stone steps. Months ago she would’ve  been admonished for being so careless though there was no one to stop  her now. <br />
  <br />
  She had gone out driving for no reason in particular.  Now that she had graduated, she had far too much free time on her  hands. She didn’t commit to working fulltime at the garage either. She  already felt restless at being restricted to it. She liked working with  engines, the feeling of oil on her skin—something Shizuru found  hilarious and teased her about—but she couldn’t imagine doing it  forever. It was too simple. She blamed it all the multitasking she had  done in high school; it ruined her. She could process information  quickly and put it to use, connecting it to whatever sources she  already had. That was why she had been able to keep and establish her  contacts while making some progress. <br />
  <br />
  Then why had she failed  at the very end? She had her sources, the information—they gave her  everything she needed to deal with the situation and yet she didn‘t  come close to succeeding. She could predict an opposing faction’s  actions. Yet, at the same time, she flagrantly missed the meaning  behind all of Shizuru’s which caused this predicament to arise. <br />
  <br />
  It  was her fault, she already deducted, for being so blind. She had a  limited perspective. She only saw herself, her faults, and paid no  attention to the world outside herself unless it suited her needs.  Therefore, she found herself isolated. <br />
  <br />
  That thought caused her  to grin bemusedly in an almost maniacal fashion. The look was  completely unbecoming and Shizuru would always reprimand her with  amusement glittering in her burgundy-colored eyes. She had once  countered that Shizuru only thought it was unbecoming because she had  been taught so. That look, she decided, of shock on the older woman’s  face was quite memorable. Shizuru had gone silent, accessing Natsuki’s  words, and said: <br />
  <br />
  <em>“My, Natsuki sometimes says wise things.” <br />
  <br />
  “You mean that I usually don’t?” She replied in mock offense. <br />
  <br />
  “Perhaps.”  Shizuru answered with a giggle. Natsuki had the feeling that she was  somehow teasing her yet she couldn’t figure out how. <br />
  <br />
  “But it  is true, isn’t it?” She gently persisted, “learned actions become  habits. And then habits become part of one’s character.” <br />
  <br />
  “Like how much you drink tea.” <br />
  <br />
  “Ara? Are you hinting at something? I seem to remember that you have been drinking an excess amount.” <br />
  <br />
  “That’s because there’s nothing else to drink!” <br />
  <br />
  “If you want to complain, then you should do the shopping.” <br />
  <br />
  “Shizuru,” she whined. <br />
  <br />
  Shizuru moved closer to her, an amused smile on her face. “What is it?” </em> <br />
  <br />
  She wondered what it was as she looked at the tread marks from her bike that now stained her front yard. <br />
  <br />
  Her  mind wandered back to what recently happened in Kyoto. She was the only  one that left it unscathed. Poor Nao, she thought. She felt responsible  for what happened to the younger woman who ultimately was the catalyst  for the event. Although, chances were that it would’ve happened sooner  or later. <br />
  <br />
  She sighed. <br />
  <br />
  <em> After the shock of Shizuru’s abrupt departure had worn off, Natsuki moved closer to Nao and helped her up. <br />
  <br />
  “Sorry about all of this,” she said, not knowing what else to say.<br />
  <br />
  Nao  scoffed even as she stumbled forward. Her arms, legs, and waist were  littered with perfectly sliced wounds. If the situation was different,  Natsuki would’ve admired Shizuru’s handiwork. From sparing with  Shizuru, she knew how formidable the woman was, even without the HiME  power. <br />
  <br />
  “If any of these leave permanent scars, I’m killing you  and that insane woman,” Nao said. Her voice slightly distorted because  she was clutching her still bleeding nose. <br />
  <br />
  Natsuki decided not  to reply. Instead, she looked around their battlefield and saw the mess  that they made. She wondered how she was going to erase all the  evidence. Maybe she could call one of her old contacts and convince  them to do a favor for her, just for old time’s sake. But first things  first. <br />
  <br />
  “Let me help you to the nearest hospital,” she offered. <br />
  <br />
  Nao glared at her, but grudging accepted her offer. <br />
  <br />
  As  they slowly walked down the stairs, they saw a group of black  suit-wearing men and woman approach them. Natsuki felt her body tense  and Nao at her side do the same. One of them approached them. With a  formal bow, the man introduced himself as Takamori Ryuusei. <br />
  <br />
  “Kuga-dono, allow us to do our job. We shall clean everything up with the best of our ability.” <br />
  <br />
  Natsuki could not prevent a small smile from appearing on her face. It seemed that Shizuru had beaten her. <br />
  <br />
  “She sent you, didn’t she?” She asked, just to confirm. <br />
  <br />
  “That would be correct, Kuga-dono. We can send both of you to one of our hospitals.” <br />
  <br />
  “Don’t  leave me with them,” Nao muttered softly so that only Natsuki could  hear. There was nervousness and a trace of fear that laced her voice  that made Natsuki reconsider just leaving her. <br />
  <br />
  “Alright,” she  said. Natsuki paused for a moment, earning another angry glare from  Nao, before she belatedly asked: “You don’t mind if I go with her to  the hospital?” <br />
  <br />
  “Not at all.” </em> <br />
  <br />
  There was an almost  fond smile on her lips as she remembered what had happened next. It was  a bit strange, relating the hospital and that situation with fondness,  but she could not help it. She had found that she could easily relate  to Nao. Both of them had uneasy memories of such places. Despite the  front that the younger girl put up—she was just like her. They were  surprisingly similar that it bordered slightly disconcerting. She and  Nao would probably never get along cordially; however, it wouldn’t stop  them from grudgingly accepting one another. <br />
  <br />
  Natsuki sighed  heavily as she stared off into a distance that she could not see. She  shifted restlessly. There was no point in just sitting there  reminiscing about the past. She wasn’t the type of person to do so. She  preferred action. And, therefore, she would take action. <br />
  <br />
  Back  then, during that fight with that gigantic six-headed snake Shizuru  called “Kiyohime,” she had finally understood something. She had  stumbled across the source of her problem. After a few nights pondering  and linking all her information together, Natsuki had come to a  conclusion. This morning she had located the source. She had been  indecisive and unsure of herself at first, but now, she saw no other  choice. If she was to move on with her life, she had to overcome that  obstacle. There was nothing more, nothing less for her to do. <br />
  <br />
  Natsuki stood up. <br />
  <br />
  She knew where she needed to go. <br />
  <br />
  Even  though she knew all of this, it didn’t make the drive there less  difficult, less taxing on her self-control. She debated and thought  over so many different scenarios that they all began to blur in her  mind. One thing lead to another and another and so forth. It was not  long before she began making excuses to avoid the soon-to-be encounter;  however, she managed to keep her resolve. <br />
  <br />
  It took her exactly  twenty-two minutes and eight seconds to reach her desired destination.  Natsuki stopped her bike in front of a modest, relatively new looking  dojo. A kendo school, to be exact. <br />
  <br />
  She took off her helmet and  ran her fingers through her hair. It was now or never. She had gone  through enough ordeals to last several lifetimes—she could handle it.  These last few years had changed her for the better, she was stronger  now—at least she hoped. <br />
  <br />
  Deep breath…<br />
  <br />
  …and there he was,  standing in front of his dojo, smiling boyishly and his embarrassment  was obvious even from a distance. There was Tate Yuuichi. Tokiha Mai  stood next to him, almost protectively, with her arms crossed. However,  Natsuki barely saw her; she did not even acknowledge her existence. All  she saw was him. <br />
  <br />
  When she approached, Tate’s awkward grin widened and he scratched his head out of reflex. <br />
  <br />
  “Hi.” <br />
  <br />
  He  hadn’t changed much since she last seen him nearly four years ago. She  had made an effort to make sure her path never crossed his at the  university. The sight of him, just standing there, looking absolutely  uncomfortable and ready to drop everything and run…it somehow made her  heart throb painfully. She didn’t know why—it just did. <br />
  <br />
  “…It’s  been a while,” she replied curtly, not willing to say his name. There  were too many memories attached to it, mostly bad ones. She had grown  since then, she had changed…Natsuki hoped. <br />
  <br />
  “Why don’t we go  inside and talk?” Tate said after a painful silence. “We’ll sit on the  veranda and chat—it’ll be like old times.” <br />
  <br />
  She almost visibly  winced. Wrong. Completely wrong thing to say. He was unlike Shizuru  that way. Somehow the Kyoto-native always seemed to find comforting  words to cheer her up. Warm, supporting words that gave her stability  and courage. <br />
  <br />
  Even so, she followed him through his—it was obviously <em>his</em>—dojo and into his home. He somehow managed to sense that she wanted to speak to him alone so he bade Mai to leave them. <br />
  <br />
  As  Natsuki sat down on his veranda, she looked into his relatively small  garden. Simplistic was the word to describe the tiny stone and sand  garden. It wasn’t even raked. While it was clean (likely Mai’s doing)  it was nothing compared to what she and Shizuru had. His garden was  sparse and common as the one Shizuru designed was masterfully  proportioned and singular. <br />
  <br />
  She finally realized that he was  waiting for her permission to speak. Instead, Natsuki sighed, and tried  to create a casual conversation. <br />
  <br />
  “I haven’t seen you around.” <br />
  <br />
  Tate laughed, visibly happy that some of the tension was released. <br />
  <br />
  “It’s  because I dropped out of the university. It was getting too  difficult…mah, that’s not exactly right—the former master of the dojo  passed away and he named me his successor so I decided to move in and… <br />
  <br />
  Natsuki  drowned out his speech and instead stared at him. He was nothing  special—his type was as common as leaves were on a tree. But that was  part of what drew her to him in the first place (for some odd reason).  Even in his twenties, Tate still looked boyish. His face was lean but  there remained that insolent look about him, like he was just getting  dragged by his ears through life and he refused to take initiative. No,  that wasn’t true—he would take it if he was backed into a wall. <br />
  <br />
  She  supposed he was valiant and courageous judging by his actions in the  past. He was strong, brave, and reliable in the sense that he would  full-heartedly support his friends and never betray them—a regular hero  type. He had a good sense of responsibility and justice, yet he was  such a quixotic person. He wasn’t afraid to bull his way through  problems, events, or people. She admired that strength of character.  Still…what drew her to him in the beginning? <br />
  <br />
  “So what about  you?” Tate said after breaking out of his dream-like state caused by  his recollection. He had finally realized that he had spoken too much. <br />
  <br />
  Natsuki smiled weakly. “I was driving by and I saw you. Was hoping to catch up on everything since it’s been a while.” <br />
  <br />
  It  was a complete lie. She had planned everything. She knew that he would  be sweeping the front of his dojo at the exact moment she arrived from  various sources. Besides, why the hell would she want to catch— <br />
  <br />
  “That’s great!” Tate smiled, “I’m glad to see you again. You look, um, as good as you always did.” <br />
  <br />
  She  hated how he could say that and the fact he meant every word. How could  he be so sincere? Didn’t she drag him around, kidnap him even, and say  all those childish things to him, back then? How could he… <br />
  <br />
  Mai  had prepared a small snack tray and tea for them. She set them down and  left. Taking a bite into a cookie, Natsuki smiled nostalgically. <br />
  <br />
  “She’s gotten better. I didn’t think it was possible.” She sighed, “That was one thing I could never beat her at.” <br />
  <br />
  “It’s alright. I think you have your own strengths.” <br />
  <br />
  The  way he said it made her feel like rolling her eyes. But, in truth, he  hadn’t changed at all. His movements, gestures—the way he talked—it was  all the same. All those things still made her heart clench—just like it  seemed to always do…but something was missing. Or was it? Maybe it  wasn’t there to begin with and she never realized it. <br />
  <br />
  She smiled. “Thank you.” <br />
  <br />
  He grinned at her before turning to the side to stare into his garden. “I’ve said nothing you need to thank.” <br />
  <br />
  What  did she want from him? What made her want him in the first place? These  were all the thoughts that pestered the mind of Kuga Natsuki. Why did  he make her feel such extreme emotions that she never felt with anyone  else and yet…those same ones made her feel awkward, not herself, and  not right. Like she exhausted herself over nothing. But it wasn’t  nothing; it was something. Something so strong that it made her… <br />
  <br />
  …wait. <br />
  <br />
  She  was staring too intensely at Tate. He had consciously moved away from  her and was doing his best not to look at her. Beads of sweat were  visible on his face. She could count them. <br />
  <br />
  He was so unlike  Shizuru. That woman would never look away from her or look so  uncomfortable under her gaze. If she did feel so, Shizuru would never  show it. She probably knew that Natsuki couldn’t take the disapproval  from those she held dear in fear of being shunned. If anything, Shizuru  would start teasing her or do something so offbeat, so…so Shizuru-like  to make her expression (and often emotion) change. It was just how that  woman was and Natsuki could not help smiling in remembrance. <br />
  <br />
  As  she continued to stay deep in thought, Tate ventured carefully closer  to her the way one would attempt to approach a particularly dangerous  animal. <br />
  <br />
  “Is something wrong?” He asked, before breaking into a nervous grin. “Is there something on my face?” <br />
  <br />
  Heh. <br />
  <br />
  After  a few more seconds of awkward silence, Natsuki could not help herself:  she started laughing. She laughed as hard as she had ever laughed.  Tears started falling. Her sides hurt; she clutched them. She hadn’t  laughed so hard in months, especially in the last few painful ones. She  really couldn't stop herself. The levity of the situation just seemed  so humorous now. The sheer discomfort that was almost tangible, Tate  Yuuichi’s face…everything was just too funny. <br />
  <br />
  All Tate could  do was stare at her incredulously and scratch his sideburns. That  action made her laugh even harder. She roared, she howled, shaking her  head from side-to-side. <br />
  After a few minutes had passed, she  finally managed to calm herself. Wiping her tears from her eyes,  Natsuki regained control of her voice. <br />
  <br />
  “Sorry. It’s just that I finally realized something about myself.” <br />
  <br />
  “Eh?” <br />
  <br />
  “I can’t believe how stupid I am.” She said, laughing. “I finally get it. It’s taken over five years for me to open my eyes.” <br />
  <br />
  She  had never felt better. She felt almost like a new person, as if she had  completely changed—she now had no burden to bear. The heavy weight that  weighed her down, causing her to focus her entire self upon supporting  it, had vanished. She now could stand up and look at her surroundings.  She felt like Amaterasu had finally come out of her cave and brought  the sun back to shine brightly on her world, causing all shadows and  lingering doubts, fears, and inhibitions to flee into the back of her  mind. <br />
  <br />
  “I can’t believe I spent not just high school, but also college mooning over you. No, it wasn’t really <em>you</em> as a person, but you as an ideal.” She said smiling, running her hand through her hair. <br />
  <br />
  “I don’t think I follow.” <br />
  <br />
  “It’s so obvious to me now. You were just <em>there</em>.  You abruptly entered my life so I wasn’t prepared.” Like Shizuru, she  thought, “I think part of me wanted someone besides me since I’ve been  alone for so long. I never considered Shizuru because she was always at  my side and…part of me always wanted to believe in the fairy tales my  parents used to tell me. <br />
  <br />
  “The moment you came between Mai and  me and accidentally bumped into my Element, I willed myself to believe  that my prince had come. I made you my Key through sheer force of will.  I followed you because I wanted security. No matter how many times you  rejected or pulled me away, I blindly continued to pursue you with  emotions I made myself to feel. I wanted you because I wanted an  dream.” <br />
  <br />
  She smiled again, resting her head on her crossed arms; her knees were tucked close to the rest of her body. <br />
  <br />
  “I  chased after a person who was never there. I hadn’t experienced enough  to realize what I felt wasn’t right or did I know what I wanted.  Therefore, if I didn’t know what I wanted, how could I have it? I was  always confused or misdirected. <br />
  <br />
  “But what—who—I wanted was  right in front of me. Just in a direction I never looked, never  considered. After a while she started to give me what I always needed.  It was only after she left that I realized, at least unconsciously,  that I was missing something—someone. The feeling of emptiness consumed  me. I yearned for something more in my life. So I went searching for a  solution. That is why I came here.” <br />
  <br />
  That had to be it. There  was no doubt in her mind anymore what she wanted. She was mature enough  to see clearly through the thick haze of misdirection and juvenile  confusion. <br />
  <br />
  It was only though looking at Tate, the person she  had chasing for so long, that she saw him finally as the person he was,  not the person she wanted him to be. It was after she realized that she  was subconsciously comparing him to Shizuru that she finally  understood. She had found that missing piece that had evaded her for so  long, even though it was always right there in front of her. <br />
  <br />
  There was no reason for her to stay any longer so Kuga Natsuki stood up. She smiled. <br />
  <br />
  “Thank you.” <br />
  <br />
  Tate grinned. “I’m not sure what happened, but I’m glad to be of use.” <br />
  <br />
  Natsuki turned and looked up to the sky. Her gaze was wistful. After, she turned back and gave a short bow. <br />
  <br />
  “I’ll excuse myself now. Thanks again for your time.” <br />
  <br />
  “Not at all. And I’ll see you around.” <br />
  <br />
  Natsuki  left Tate Yuuichi sitting on the floor of his engawa and moved swiftly  through his home. She was about to leave the genkan before she heard  the sound of loud footsteps and Mai calling out: <br />
  <br />
  “Wait,” she said. <br />
  <br />
  Natsuki stopped and turned to look at her. <br />
  <br />
  “Yeah?” <br />
  <br />
  “These are for you,” Mai held up a bag containing a box of her homemade cookies. <br />
  <br />
  “Thank you.” <br />
  <br />
  “I…overheard your conversation with Yuuichi.” <br />
  <br />
  “I know.” <br />
  <br />
  “You did?” <br />
  <br />
  “Didn’t care.” <br />
  <br />
  “Even  so, I’m glad for you.” Her purple eyes looked down to the side. “We’ve  never been really close but I get the feeling that we would’ve been  really good friends if circumstances had been different. It feels like  a shame, you know?” <br />
  <br />
  Natsuki joined her nervous laughter before replying. “I think so too.” <br />
  <br />
  “But  there is still time. We still have another chance. We’re over our  petting rivalry and eh…what?” She looked at the hand Natsuki extended. <br />
  <br />
  Natsuki looked at her expectantly. “Your cookies, give them to me.” <br />
  <br />
  “Oh.” The sound of more laughter and the plastic bag exchanging hands was heard. <br />
  <br />
  Natsuki looked at Mai and saw the other do the same. They both smiled. <br />
  <br />
  “I hope you get her back.” <br />
  <br />
  Natsuki looked away. “Me too” <br />
  <br />
  She put her helmet on and started to walk towards where she had parked her motorcycle. <br />
  Mai called out once more from the genkan. “You and Kaichou-san are invited to come over anytime!” <br />
  <br />
  Natsuki flipped her visor up and nodded, smiling although the other woman could not see. <br />
  <br />
  With  a careless wave of her hand, Kuga Natsuki left the kendo dojo with her  mind clearer than ever before. She felt at peace with herself,  something she had never felt since she was very young. And she  certainly knew what she had to do. <br />
  <br />
  *~*~*~ <br />
  <br />
  <em>The moment she saw him, their eyes met, she fell in love with him. (No, not her—</em>she<em> did.) There was something about him, the kindness in his warm, brown  eyes that spoke of deep wisdom, gentleness, and yet there was a bit of  troubled confliction in them. They reached out to her. Her heart  skipped a beat. Her eyes widened and she saw his do the same. She once  again seemed to be completely engulfed in the sheer brownness that was  his eyes. It just took a single moment, a second suspended in time—that  intake of breath, motion stopped—and she fell so completely into him in  a way she never dreamed possible. There was no logic to it—she just  did. (But </em>she<em> didn’t, </em>she<em> did.)<br />
  <br />
  “Who is he,” she asked, tugging on her father’s sleeve. <br />
  <br />
  The  innkeeper laughed at his daughter. He took her infatuation lightly and,  seeing how he had just drunk his evening sake, he was in a merry mood. <br />
  <br />
  “That man is to be your husband.” <br />
  <br />
  She  knew he was joking. The man—monk, actually—grinned, taking no offense  of the comment. His name was Anchin. As a child, he had been orphaned.  He grew up in a temple not too far from their inn. Now, at the age of  20—he was three years older than her—he decided to go on a pilgrimage  to find himself. To search for that complete awakening, enlightenment.  Something like that. He was looking for a place to stay for the night.  Because of the generous amount of money he was willing to spend, her  parents readily welcomed him. <br />
  <br />
  She found herself drowning in  him (it wasn’t her, it was someone else). Everything about Anchin was  alluring and fully engrossing. He kept himself well groomed.  Everything, including him, was maintained clean and orderly which was  something that likely existed due to his background, but it was a  characteristic that she, an innkeeper’s daughter, valued highly in a  person. The way he smiled, the way his eyes would disappear when he  smiled, the way he would acknowledge her when she came in to give him  tea…the polite tone he would always speak to her in…how could she (not  her!) not adore him? <br />
  <br />
  They found much to talk about, every year  he stopped by. He was patient and let her talk excitedly and  passionately—for she was a very passionate, emotional person—something  her parents forbid her to do for it was unbecoming of a girl her age.  She was the only child and she rarely found anyone to talk to; the inn  was rather far from the nearby town. They were slightly secluded—in the  middle of nowhere, really. She therefore rarely had anyone to talk to  and relish any chance to speak to a willing listener. (it wasn’t her,  it was someone else). <br />
  <br />
  He was the first person that really  talked to her. She didn’t get scolded or was laughed deridingly at even  though she was young and slightly clumsy. When she accidentally broke  her sandal and tripped, he just laughed kindly and helped her up. He  even fixed her broken footwear for her! <br />
  <br />
  She (she wasn’t this  person) knew that he liked her too. She wasn’t beautiful  appearance-wise, she was a bit plain really, but she was still somewhat  attractive. But that didn’t matter seeing how handsome Anchin seemed to  enjoy her presence as much as she did his. In slightly dissimilar ways,  they were lonely people which instinctively took comfort in each other.  That was what she thought. <br />
  <br />
  Every time he came to visit, he  would always bring her an extravagant gift. Then they would go  somewhere and talk. Anchin always seemed like he was torn in two  separate ways. He had a hard time making decisions. Although, one day,  when they reached his room, he had slid the door close and then kissed  her! Oh how she cherished that kiss and would always remember it (it  wasn’t her; these weren’t the emotions she were feeling). He spoke  softly, saying how he loved her and, if it was for her sake, give up  his life as a monk so they could go live together somewhere. Her heart  soared across the brilliant, cloudless blue heaven! He was speaking the  words that she wished to hear! How could she say no? It was so  romantic! Tomorrow he would go back to the monastery, gather up what  little belongings he owned, tell the others that he would be leaving,  and then they would go. Did she want to? <br />
  <br />
  Oh didn’t she! That  night she climbed into his bed and laid next to him. Anchin only smiled  at her (not her, not her!) action and turned to the other side,  refusing to face her. He looked so conflicted and forlorn. She hugged  him fiercely but he didn’t react. That morning, he patted her head and  told her: <br />
  <br />
  “Wait for me. I will come back soon.” <br />
  <br />
  “Will you promise me, Anchin?” <br />
  <br />
  He smiled. She swore that his smile was almost sad. “I promise. I shall return.” <br />
  <br />
  His  eyes were stormy; she couldn’t read his emotions. But she clung onto  his promise and the remnants of the passionate kiss which they shared  together. There was no way that Anchin would ever go back on his word,  she reasoned. So she held fiercely onto all her memories of him and  waited (it wasn’t her! wasn’t her, she wasn’t Kiyohime, she was—) <br />
  <br />
  Over  a year passed. In her family’s garden, the chrysanthemums had blossomed  and then faded, much like her foolish, girlish dreams. Winter turned  into spring and then all the seasons began to blur in her mind in a  hazy swirl of delirium. He’ll come, she willed herself to believe.  He’ll come. Anchin will come. He will come, he will come, he will come,  he will come, he will come…he will come! He has too! <br />
  <br />
  He  didn’t. He never did. She felt her body growing weaker and weaker. She  didn’t eat. She barely slept, if at all. Her paler skin became paler  still. Why didn’t he come? She stared at the maple trees whose leaves  were red like blood now. Why won’t Anchin come? She thought, crying to  herself. He promised. <br />
  <br />
  Her parents worried about her. They sent  for all the best doctors that they could find. But none of them could  help her. How could they heal a sickness as deep and incurable as love? <br />
  <br />
  Deep happiness, joy, and love turned into expectation. When  expectation faded , it became sorrow. Now, her poignant sadness had  been rendered into hatred. From hatred it evolved into blind,  all-consuming rage that shook her to her very core. Sorrow had turned  her into a weak apparition of her old, vivacious self. Rage caused her  to shed her former self entirely. She was no longer human. The chill of  cold, burning despair had crept upon her and consumed what was left of  her body. From there, her powerful hatred turned her spirit into a  snake. She would destroy everything that stood in her way of happiness!  If Anchin could not give up his attachment for his beloved monastery,  she would destroy it! She would burn everything in her path with her  fiery wrath! For his sake and hers, she would do anything! Everything!<br />
  <br />
  It  was Anchin’s fault! Everything was his fault! He caused her to become  this way, he gave her so much happiness and then heartlessly took it  all away because of his indecision! How dare he deceive her! How dare  he! He would pay. He would pay! She was going to make him feel her  fury. She was going to make him feel fear and then she—she…<br />
  <br />
  Not  she! It wasn’t her. This wasn’t her rage. She wasn’t this person. She  struggled. She needed to break out of this. Hurry! Break…</em> <br />
  <br />
  In  her penthouse apartment in Kyoto, Fujino Shizuru woke up, panting  heavily. She had been dreaming but it wasn’t her dream. She saw the  events happening through the eyes of a spectator. Somewhat. It was hard  to describe. The feelings, she felt them as if she was that person. She  was both a spectator and that person. She was an entity that saw things  with that person’s eyes. It strained her mind to attempt to  differentiate between her and that woman—Kiyohime. <br />
  <br />
  The dream  had shaken her badly. She knew she had almost lost herself completely  in that dream. Shizuru shifted in her bed and then sat upright. Burying  her face into her hands, she tried to calm herself. Breathe in, breathe  out. She slowly relaxed. <br />
  <br />
  Even though her hands still shook,  she managed to pour herself a glass of water. These dreams were getting  stronger and stronger. Shizuru didn’t know how much more she could  take. One day, likely very soon, she would get lost in them. After she  had finally regained control of herself, she stood up. <br />
  <br />
  As she  slowly walked towards one of the large, glass windows of her suite,  Shizuru stared at her reflection. Her nights have obviously been  sleepless seeing how bloodshot her eyes were. There were also black  rings under them that, right now, no make-up attempted to hide. Shizuru  curled her hands into fists, her entire body tensed before she finally  let out a sigh. Gathering her wits, she called out: <br />
  <br />
  “Kiyohime!” <br />
  <br />
  “You called, <em>Mother?</em>” The ghost retorted, appearing promptly. <br />
  <br />
  Shizuru’s  reflection had been contorted into an entirely different entity.  Staring back at her were not her usually burgundy-colored eyes, but  bright yellow ones slit like a snake’s. While she seemed exhausted,  Kiyohime could not be more vibrant. However, that energy was not doing  well for her. The ghost’s appearance was becoming less and less  human-like and more like that hideous form she had appeared in during  that rooftop battle that seemed an eternity ago. Her form seemed to  reflect her sanity as well. Kiyohime was slowly going insane. <br />
  <br />
  “What is the meaning of this?” Shizuru asked harshly. <br />
  <br />
  “Meaning of what?” Replied what would’ve been an innocent tone had a snicker not followed it. <br />
  <br />
  “You know what I mean, Kiyohime. Why are you invading my dreams?” <br />
  <br />
  “Am  I? Or are you invading my own?” The pointed teeth-filled mouth slid  into a fearsome smile, showing even more of the ghost’s fangs. “Perhaps  we are becoming one or have always been one and the same?” <br />
  <br />
  “Leave me. Now.” <br />
  <br />
  “But I can not. I have said before, <em>Mother</em>,  your emotions bonded me to you. I am the product of your feelings. And  as long as you can not abandon your feelings for Anchin, I shall remain  your Child.” <br />
  <br />
  “Natsuki! Her name is Natsuki.” Shizuru said, grimacing. <br />
  <br />
  “You will go after Anchin. You cannot help but to.”<br />
  <br />
  “You will not make me do anything against my will.”<br />
  <br />
  Kiyohime  laughed. She reached out from the glass wall and, using one of her  scaly hands, forced Shizuru to look at her. “Human resolve is so  breakable. Pure emotions are stronger.”<br />
  <br />
  “What are you trying to do to me?” Her eyes were hard, unreadable. <br />
  <br />
  Here another monstrous smirk was given. “Nothing you don’t want to.” <br />
  <br />
  “You’re  nothing but a broken record who keeps repeating the same phrases. I  will not allow you to control me and continue the vicious cycle you  have wrought for all these centuries.” <br />
  <br />
  “Am I really  controlling you? Am I really here? Or perhaps you are talking to  yourself. Even if I wasn’t here, Fujino Shizuru, you would still think  these same thoughts. My presence only strengthens the feelings you  already have. You will go after her because you want to. You still  belong to her. ”<br />
  <br />
  “I belong to no one but myself. And I will do nothing as childish as pursuing a lost cause.” <br />
  <br />
  “Continue lying to yourself. But I know what you really want to do.” <br />
  <br />
  Shizuru  chose not to reply. Instead she looked down, past the apparition, and  into the city that stretched beyond her sight. The lights shined burned  strong in modern-day Kyoto despite the extremely early hour. She could  also see dimmer areas with only a few scattered lights about,  indicating housing districts, and darker areas still which signified  old landmarks such as temples. Everything else seemed so distant to her  now, like it was some fantasy-world that she used to live in. She  wished she had never gone to that cursed island, enrolled there, fallen  in love, and gotten herself caught in this downward spiral of madness  that she was certain would lead to her self-destruction. Her hand  instinctively clutched her stomach wound where Kiyohime’s mark now  resided. <br />
  <br />
  That obviously wasn’t the right thing to do as the ghost lost her patience. <br />
  <br />
  “YOU  WILL GO AFTER ANCHIN!” She shriek loudly, reverting back into her  revolting form. Her form disappeared from the glass and reappeared  behind her. An inhumanly strong, monstrous arm wrapped around her neck,  choking her tightly, crushing her—she couldn’t breathe, she felt  everything slowly fading away—lifting her from the ground. Her feet  dangled uselessly in the air. The mark burned her skin. <br />
  <br />
  Shizuru  tried her best to focus. She was the one in control. She would not lose  to her disobedient Child. She felt her body relax under her and her  stolen strength return to her. She had to concentrate in forcing the  ghost to disappear. <br />
  <br />
  Kiyohime let loose another ear-splitting  scream and threw her to the side like a rag doll. Shizuru hit the back  of her leather couch painfully. As she tried to calm her breathing, she  dimly saw the ghost thrashed wildly, to and fro, clutching her head.  Shizuru saw her room suddenly consumed in abyss-summoned flames. Their  heat burned her from both inside and out. Sweat beaded down her face  from the sheer intensity of the fire. <br />
  <br />
  “HE WILL PAY! HE DESERVES TO STAY HERE FOREVER AND GRIEVE! I WON’T LET ANCHIN GO! HE WILL SEE EVERYTHING HE HAS CAUSED!”<br />
  <br />
  She  had enough of this. Wiping the blood from her lips, Shizuru managed to  stand up. It was only through her determination that she managed to  regain her bearings even though she had to lean against the wall to  remain stable. <br />
  <br />
  “Kiyohime, I order you to leave.”<br />
  <br />
  The  ghost-possessed Child could not disobey a direct command issued with  deadly solemnity. She instantly went silent under her gaze that was  colder than steel and disappeared. The flames left as well, leaving her  room as it was before, as if nothing had ever transpired. It had all  happened in her head. <br />
  <br />
  Shizuru remained on her feet only  through the sheer force of her will. After a few minutes had passed and  she was certain she had regained the ability to walk, she sighed  heavily and moved to her desk. She turned her laptop on. She would not  be sleeping for what little remained of the night.<br />
  <br />
  Even though she refused to think such thoughts, one did worm its way into her mind:<br />
  <br />
  <em>Save me. Anyone…Natsuki…</em></p>
