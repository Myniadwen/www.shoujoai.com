It was yet another  gloomy day…and on top of that, it was a Monday.
<p>That isn’t to say  that I completely hated the rainy season that struck the country  every June. Actually, there was something oddly soothing about the  constant pattering of water droplets hitting the manmade structures  of the city. Simply put, it had a way of easing my mind.</p>
<p>I  enjoyed a good storm every now and then; I just didn’t want to be<em>caught</em> in one, which seemed to be a very high possibility at the moment.</p>
<p>“<em>You’d  best not be thinking about it,”</em> I  threatened the ever-darkening clouds overhead.</p>
<p>I was currently seated  outside of Fuuka Station, one of the many bus stations that spotted  the area, watching and waiting for the next bus to come through to  pick up it’s would-be passengers. It had just been two days ago  that one of these very caravans had been in an accident. Specific  details on what had actually happened were nonexistent to the general  public, which only served to make my level of suspicion rise towards  one very unwelcome possibility: Orphan. With that in mind, I had  immediately sought out Sakomizu during the lunch break. I thought  back on the conversation that had just taken place with the man an  hour or so ago.</p>
<p align="center">“<em>Gathering  flowers to send to Sawada-sensei?”</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>So  you heard about that too?”</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>How  could I not? It’s all over the news, and it’s the hottest topic  amongst the students.”</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>I  see—“</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>But  considering the vague details of the crash, I assume that there’s</em><em><strong>something</strong></em><em> that </em><em><strong>someone</strong></em><em> doesn’t want the rest of the world to know about.”</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>And  that would be…?”</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>...”</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>A sigh.</em></p>
<p align="center">“…<em>Yes,  it’s their doing. Our men moved in for the cleanup. But  Sawada-sensei’s unlucky, too…Well, it seems like the things have  been taken care of and he has transferred to a regular hospital.”</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>What  about the Orphan?”</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>Don’t  know. However, there is evidence of battle. It’s a new HiME.”</em></p>
<p>I frowned at the  thought.</p>
<p><em>Another one slipped  through my fingers…or perhaps she was already at Fuuka? That is a  possibility…I’m pretty certain there are more already here. I  just wish I had a way of finding out who they were before things like</em><em><strong>this</strong></em><em> happened.</em></p>
<p>There really wasn’t  any point in thinking about it. It wasn’t like that was ever going  to happen.</p>
<p>The visual image of  going classroom-to-classroom asking all of the HiMEs to <em>“please  raise their hands”</em> passed through my mind.</p>
<p>I <em>almost</em> smirked.</p>
<p>The familiar rumbling  of a giant engine flooded my ears, breaking my trance, and I snapped  my head in its direction. I looked on as the thing pulled up, dropped  off it’s current passengers, picked up some new ones, and left to  venture back into the city.</p>
<p>I sighed in agitated  impatience.</p>
<p><em>No Orphan this  time…It’s bound to show up sooner or later though.</em></p>
<p>Stifling a yawn, I  pulled out my cell to check the time. School would be letting out in  about another half hour, not that it really meant anything to me.  Sitting back on the seat of my bike, I let myself relax a little  since it would be another fifteen minutes before the next bus rolled  through.</p>
<p>It was at times like  this that I sometimes wished I had a car. Well, to be more specific,  a radio would have been nice, especially since not having one only  left we with my own thoughts, and let’s just say that my brain and  I didn’t always have the most thrilling conversations.</p>
<p>This time, however, my  mind was occupied with sifting through all the names of my female  classmates and what little I knew about them. Did any of them  particularly stick out in my mind? Not really. I hadn’t witnessed  or heard of anyone doing anything spectacular or unnatural as of  late. Of course, their powers might still have been dormant for now.  They might have not yet awakened to their true selves…their true  fate.</p>
<p>The fifteen minutes  passed. Another bus came and went, and there was still no sign of an  Orphan.</p>
<p>Beginning to consider  just driving about the city to hunt the damn Orphan down, I convinced  myself to just stay a little while longer. I waited the presumed time  allotment again and this time, thanks to my intuition, I hit gold.</p>
<p>It was there, right in  front of me, plastered to the side of the bus. The creature looked  very much like an insect, which wasn’t much of a surprise since  most Orphans tended to take on that appearance, or at least this held  true to the ones I had encountered. The thing must have had some way  of camouflaging itself to normal individuals…too bad for it I  wasn’t normal.</p>
<p>I waited for the driver  to acquire his new passengers before starting the engine of my  Ducati. Giving the bus a moment to pull out of the station, I then  took off in pursuit.</p>
<p><em>I can’t risk doing  anything while still in the city…I’ll have to wait until we’ve  reached a more remote area if I’m going to try to provoke the  thing…</em></p>
<p>I followed the vehicle  as nonchalantly as I possibly could and eventually we traveled to the  outskirts the city; there were no buildings, no houses, just open  road and trees. And then, suddenly, the bus swerved, tires screeching  from the abrupt movement. I saw the passengers inside begin to stand  from their seats, when all of a sudden there was a flash of purple  from within and the back window cracked.</p>
<p><em>It’s inside?!</em></p>
<p>I immediately summoned  my element in my right hand while steadily maintaining control of my  bike with the other. I waited until I saw the Orphan appear in the  window again before I took my shot, shattering the glass of the back  window in the process. The thing screamed as I apparently hit it, and  the next thing I knew it was slithering out the new exit I had just  made and on to the top of the vehicle. I took aim and fired again,  but this time the monster dodged, and in the process tipped the bus  onto the wheels on it’s left side. It hung there for what seemed  like several seconds before spilling onto its side, still sliding  from its momentum. Before it could fall, however, the Orphan was sure  to abandon ship and lunge straight for me.</p>
<p><em>Oh shit—!</em></p>
<p>The thing landed right  in front of me, causing me to swerve around the impending strike, but  right towards the now stationary bus. I shoved off my bike with all  the power I could muster, sending myself flying through the air  before hitting pavement and tumbling several feet before finally  coming to a rest. Rolling onto my stomach, I materialized my other  pistol and began rapidly firing at the creature. Pulling myself to my  feet as I continued my onslaught, the Orphan took off, seeking  shelter further up the hill. I immediately pursued, not letting up on  either trigger until it disappeared from my sight.</p>
<p><em>Damn it’s fast!</em></p>
<p>I tried to continue,  but when I turned the corner it was nowhere to be seen. I clicked my  tongue in annoyance before grimacing from the sudden shot of pain  that shot through my left arm and shoulder. Thinking that it might  have doubled back, I turned and began making the trek back down to  where the bus and my motorcycle lay.</p>
<p><em>Guess I landed  harder than I thought…I figured that thing would be weakened </em><em><strong>a  little</strong></em><em> if another HiME fought it…I guess if she’d just  awakened she wouldn’t be much of a match for it—Huh? Mai…What  is she doing here?</em></p>
<p>As soon as the  orange-haired HiME noticed me, she immediately ran to my side, a look  of pure concern taking over her features, “Kuga-san…”</p>
<p>“Damn, it escaped,”  I muttered after seeing that the Orphan wasn’t here either.</p>
<p>The sound of  approaching sirens caused us both to turn towards their source, and  sure enough, three ambulances soon came into view.</p>
<p>“They’re fast, as  expected,” I remarked in no surprise as I glanced over the  wreckage.</p>
<p><em>Tsk, so much for  that bike…</em></p>
<p>Ignoring the thought, I  began walking in the opposite direction, “Come.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“Hurry up,” I  ordered.</p>
<p>The two of us made it  up the hill, and once we were out of sight, we climbed up to the  wooded area above the accident scene to spy on the “emergency crew”  that quickly got to work on loading victims into their vehicles.  There was even a line of suited men to block off the area while  firemen doused the bus that had caught fire from the leaking fuel.</p>
<p>“Who are those men?”  Mai questioned, not averting her gaze from the bustle below.</p>
<p>Deciding that there was  no point in holding back any information now, I went ahead an  answered, “They’re from a group called the First District.  They’re gathering the HiME’s to the Academy. Besides, that  ambulance is a fake.”</p>
<p>The girl snapped her  head around, “Huh?!”</p>
<p>“They take the  patients to the hospital that they control, and make them forget  everything they saw.”</p>
<p>“You’re joking,  right?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what  you think of your powers,” I began, meeting her gaze, “but this  is the reality for us HiMEs.”</p>
<p>Sure, it might have  sounded a little harsh, and not needed to be professed so bluntly,  but when it came to the First District and anything dealing with the  HiMEs there really was no room for fluffy cushioning. Mai needed to  know this information. <em>All </em>the HiMEs needed to know this  information. I might not be aware of who they all were at the moment,  but I could at least warn the ones that I did know.</p>
<p>Once the First District  men had completed their clean up and loaded all the bystanders and  workers into their various vehicles, they disappeared as quickly as  they had come. Seeing no further reason to stick around, I moved to  get up.</p>
<p>“Where are you  going?” Mai asked, her voice somewhat shaky, causing me to pause.</p>
<p>“Back home. There’s  nothing else to do here.”</p>
<p>“But—!”</p>
<p>“I suggest you do the  same,” I cut her off, turning my gaze skyward, “it looks like  it’s going to rain any time now.”</p>
<p>The redhead remained  silent as I walked deeper into the woods. After I had put some  distance between us, I called upon my child, and once he had appeared  and changed over to flight mode, I hopped on Duran’s back and flew  towards the city.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“<em>Kuga-san, what do  want?”</em>
<p>“I need a new bike.”</p>
<p>“<em>Another one?!”</em></p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p><em>A sigh, “Fine, but  don’t think it’ll be as easy this time.”</em></p>
<p>“What? Why not?”</p>
<p>“<em>We got lucky last  time. I bet Amuro will have to get one shipped here this time  around.”</em></p>
<p>“And how long will  that take?”</p>
<p>“<em>Mmm…probably a  day or two if you’re willing to pay the money for overnight  shipping.”</em></p>
<p>“Do whatever it  takes, just get me one…quickly.”</p>
<p>To leave no room for  argument, I hung up on Yamada as soon as the last word was out of  mouth.</p>
<p>Now that that was taken  care of, I threw my cell onto the bed and walked over to the  bathroom. Retrieving the medical kit out of the cabinet beneath the  sink, I placed it on the counter before taking a seat on the toilet,  unzipping my leather suit in the process. I pealed it down to my  waist, hissing when I pulled the material over my injured left arm.  Taking a look to assess the damage, I was relieved to see that there  was only some bruising and slight swelling. I hastily wrapped the  area before lumbering back downstairs to get some ice to put on it as  well. Before doing so, however, I made myself a quick sandwich, which  was a rather difficult task considering I really only had one hand to  work with. Once I had done so, not forgetting to add the appropriate  amount of mayo, I fixed a bag of ice and plopped down on the couch to  relax for once.</p>
<p>“Ah!” I quietly  yelped as I placed the bag on my injured shoulder. No matter how many  times I had done the action, the initial sting from the cold always  made me twitch.</p>
<p>I turned on the TV,  flipping over to the local news station before finally taking a bite  out of my sandwich. Sure enough, there was a story about the latest  bus crash, and of course there were quite a few specifics left out.</p>
<p>“Those First District  bastards sure know how to cover their ass…They probably have people  in the media for situations like this…” I bitterly mused out loud  as I finished my dinner.</p>
<p><em>They really are  everywhere, Yamada said it himself. And they could be anyone…I  mean, if a guy like Sakomizu can be in their organization…</em></p>
<p>I nearly laughed at the  thought.</p>
<p>…<em>I wonder why that  man is leaking information to me…against his own well being too…</em></p>
<p>As my thoughts continued to wander, my eyelids began to get heavier  and heavier, and before long, I was out like a light.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
When I woke up the next  morning to the sound of the television informing me of some  once-in-a-lifetime offer that I shouldn’t pass up, I groaned and  shifted slightly on the couch and was startled when something cool on  top of me moved as well.
<p>“Huh?” I sleepily  grumbled as I picked up the item.</p>
<p>The events of last  night flooded my memory when I looked over the now melted bag of ice.  I was honestly surprised, and relieved, that the thing hadn’t  leaked all over the couch and me during the night, but I certainly  wasn’t complaining about missing out on the cleanup.</p>
<p>Sitting up, I removed  the medical wrap from my shoulder and was quite pleased to see that  the swelling had gone down considerably during the night, just  leaving the bruising to remind me of the tumble from yesterday. I  tested my arm’s movement and found that I could do so relatively  comfortably and without making it look awkward in the process.</p>
<p><em>Well, that’s good.  Maybe it won’t be so obvious at school…although skipping first  period would probably be a smart idea, I don’t know how apt my  shoulder is to swim just yet…Speaking of, I wonder what time it is…</em></p>
<p>I turned my attention  to the TV and squinted at the little box telling the current time and  temperature.</p>
<p>“Five o’clock?!  Geez…Well, I guess I did go to sleep earlier than usual, but  still…”</p>
<p>Slightly begrudged at  the hours of sleep I had deprived myself of, I made my way upstairs  to get cleaned up for the day ahead.</p>
<p>A few hours, a shower,  and a bowl of cereal later I dressed myself in my uniform, gathered  my things, and set out the door. Since I didn’t have my motorcycle,  and refused to use any form of public transportation when it could  clearly be avoided, I sneaked off into the damp woods to call upon my  other mode of transportation…</p>
<p>I allowed Duran to drop  me off at the spot where I usually parked my bike before telling him  to disperse, not without giving my child a thankful pat on the muzzle  for his service.</p>
<p>Since first period was  still in session, the walk up to the school was quiet and peaceful,  the only real sounds being the occasional splash and the distant  murmur of students at the pool where I should have been at the  moment. I went ahead and ventured inside, making my way to the  student council room to kill the remaining ten minutes until my next  class. The door was locked, as expected, but not for too long. It  really wasn’t that hard to pick the lock with the right tools and  maneuverability, and soon enough I let myself in, sliding the door  shut behind me before I walked over to Shizuru’s desk, threw my bag  on it’s top, and promptly sat down in her swivel chair, leaning  back to stare up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>I sat there for a few  minutes before boredom got the better of me and I began to look for  something to entertain myself with. Observing the oak desk in front  of me, I happened to notice that one of the drawers was slightly  ajar, and curiosity taking over, I reached down to open it the rest  of the way. The thing was relatively deep and seemingly housed quite  a few items by the feel of it. Peering inside, I inspected the said  contents.</p>
<p><em>Pens, pencils,  scissors…paper, stapler and staples…chalk…emergency tea supply.  That doesn’t surprise me…Huh?</em></p>
<p>I shoved my hand into  the draw to retrieve a white envelope, and once I pulled it out, I  looked it over. Shrugging, and choosing to throw out the fact that it  was really none of my business, I opened the thing anyway.</p>
<p><em>A wedding  invitation? What’s this about…Takahashi Ayame and Suzuki  Hiroshi…Saturday, June 23 at ten o’clock…Fuuka Shrine…</em></p>
<p>The sound of a key  sliding into the lock just outside the door grabbed my attention, and  panic immediately set in. A string of profanities cruised through my  head, a few managing to escape me, as I hastily tried to stuff the  card back into its envelope. I wasn’t fast enough, however, and was  soon met with surprised crimson eyes.</p>
<p>“Natsuki?”</p>
<p><em>Shit, I’ve been  had.</em></p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>“What are you doing  here?” Shizuru questioned as she walked over to me, “What are you  looking at?”</p>
<p><em>Quick, think fast.</em></p>
<p>“Um…”</p>
<p><em>So much for that…</em></p>
<p>Noticing the opened  drawer, the girl then glanced at the object in my hand. It wasn’t  that hard for her to put two and two together, “Ara, going through  my things, hm?”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t really—!  I mean, I didn’t mean to—! Eh…I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>The Kyoto beauty merely  chuckled at me, “Is Natsuki really that interested in me? You could  just ask, you know…”</p>
<p>“…I was just  bored…” I grumbled.</p>
<p>“And your first  choice was to sift through my desk?”</p>
<p>I remained silent as my  cheeks colored, pouting apologetically.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’m  not angry,” Shizuru informed me. “What is it that you were  looking at anyway?”</p>
<p>I handed her the card,  “Wedding invitation.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, Mr. Suzuki’s  son. The ceremony’s next weekend if I remember correctly.”</p>
<p>“You know the  family?”</p>
<p>“Not really,”  Shizuru began, “Mr. Suzuki’s one of the school directors, so  Reito-san and I were asked to attend on behalf of the school.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…Does that mean  the Rijichou will be attending as well?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do believe  that Kazahana-sama will be present.”</p>
<p>“I see…” I  stated.</p>
<p><em>This might be my  chance to sneak into her residence to have a look around…</em></p>
<p>Ever since the first  time I had taken foot inside of that mansion I had wanted to go back  to look around. There was just something…off about it. The house  was eerily quiet, and I just couldn’t shake the feeling that there  was more in the residence than meets the eye. The only problem was  that I never knew when its current occupants, Kazahana Mashiro and  her maid Himeno Fumi, would be present. The Rijichou had offered to  speak with me on matters dealing with the HiME, but I knew she would  never reveal what I was truly looking for. The last thing I wanted  was for that creepily matured kid to be questioning me on the reasons  for my inquires, so that left me with the sole option of breaking in  when no one was around, and it seemed, if Shizuru was correct, that  in about two weeks that chance would finally present itself to me.</p>
<p>Before giving Shizuru  the opportunity to question me on my interest in the school director,  I quickly continued, “That must suck to have to waste your Saturday  at some dumb ceremony.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s  dumb. Weddings are beautiful…two people professing their love for  one another like that.”</p>
<p>I sighed, “So you’re  one of those hopeless romantic girls too, huh?”</p>
<p>“I guess you could  say that,” the burgundy eyed girl replied with a sweet smile.</p>
<p>I could only shake my  head, “I’m sure your fan club would just love to know that.”</p>
<p>“Is that a threat,  Natsuki? Or is it just jealousy?”</p>
<p>I chose to ignore that  last bit.</p>
<p>Standing, I began  making my way towards the door, “Bah…I guess I’d better be off  to class. It would be horrible if the Seitokaichou herself made one  of her fellow students late.”</p>
<p>Shizuru chuckled at my  sarcasm while placing a hand on her cheek, “Unthinkable.”</p>
<p>“Well, see you  later.”</p>
<p>“Goodbye, Natsuki.  And promise me you’ll stay for <em>all</em> of your classes today,  hm?”</p>
<p>I merely waved her off as I exited the room.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
June 23.
<p>Today was the day. As  much as I loathed the idea of waking up early on a Saturday, it was  unavoidable today. I made sure to eat a little something before  slipping into my biker suit, grabbing my helmet, and walking out the  door. Thankfully I had a motorcycle in my possession again and had so  for a little over a week.</p>
<p>Yamada had been a day  off in his prediction of its arrival.</p>
<p>I threatened to not pay  him for it.</p>
<p>In the end I got a  small discount.</p>
<p>Had I missed my baby?  Maybe just a little…</p>
<p>Straddling the  masterpiece, I shot off towards the school. After I had parked in my  usual spot, I quickly and quietly snaked my way to the director’s  residence. Figuring that the garden was the route with the most  cover, I immediately headed in its direction.</p>
<p>There was a light  breeze blowing through the air, carrying off delicate petals in  various hues of pink. I couldn’t help but think of that first day  Shizuru and I met as I crept through the walkways, trying to keep low  in case anyone should be around, even though I highly doubted there  would be. Or at least I believed so until I heard voices off in the  distance.</p>
<p>I quickly detoured off  the brick path and onto the freshly cut grass. Positioning myself  behind the nearest tree, I was completely stunned at what I  witnessed.</p>
<p>Kazahana Mashiro…Himeno  Fumi…and Homura Nagi. All present and accounted for. Having a nice  little morning chat in the school gardens.</p>
<p><em>The hell? What’s  this about…</em></p>
<p>I mentally smacked my  inner voice to make it shut up for the moment and focused in on the  conversation that was taking place just a few yards away. The  Rijichou’s voice was the first to become clear.</p>
<p align="center">“…<em>so  it’s at the Fuuka Shrine…”</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>The  seal’s not broken yet, but it seems to be only a matter of time,”</em>Nagi answered.</p>
<p align="center">“<em>I  see.”</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>It’s  a good opportunity to take care of it, so I don’t plan on getting  involved.”</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>A  pause.</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>You  look very nice, Mashiro-sama,” </em>Fumi piped in</p>
<p>The serious  conversation seemed to end at this point, and averting my attention,  I cursed at my own belatedness.</p>
<p><em>Dammit…what were  they talking about? A seal? At the Fuuka Shrine? Wait a minute…that’s  where that wedding’s being held today!</em></p>
<p>I gritted my teeth  together.</p>
<p><em>Shit…this is my  opportunity to get into the director’s residence…but the  shrine…Is something bad going to happen there? Eh, this </em><em><strong>is</strong></em><em> Fuuka…bad and worse are the only things we know around here…</em></p>
<p align="center">“…<em><strong>The  ceremony’s next weekend…”</strong></em></p>
<p align="center">“…<em><strong>Reito-san and I were asked to attend on behalf of the school…”</strong></em></p>
<p>My eyes widened as the  voice echoed through my head.</p>
<p>I could clearly see  Shizuru smiling at me as she spoke the words.</p>
<p>Shoving myself from the  tree, I sprinted towards my motorcycle as fast as my legs could carry  me.</p>
<p><em>I promised I  wouldn’t let you get involved with this…as long as I’m still  standing, that holds true…Shizuru…</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t long before  I was blazing down the road towards the shrine. Luckily it was a  pretty well known site in the area, so even I knew where it was  located. The problem was actually getting there. As soon as I got  remotely close to the place, traffic immediately came to a near stand  still. I sure was glad to have HiME reflexes as I slammed on the  brakes before I could ram into the back of the fancy looking car in  front of me. Planting my feet on the ground, I tried to see just how  far back I was stuck.</p>
<p>Let’s just say I  wasn’t happy with what I saw.</p>
<p>Making a last second  decision, I veered off the road and into the woods. Once I was a ways  in, I cut the engine, booted the kickstand, and dismounted.</p>
<p>“Duran!”</p>
<p>The metallic beast  appeared before me already in his flight mode as if he could read my  thoughts. I sprung onto his back and the two of us jetted up the hill  towards the shrine. As we ascended, I could vaguely see huddles of  people in front of the building through the line of trees, but the  sound of an explosion further up drove me onward.</p>
<p>I pulled up just in  time to see Minagi Mikoto strike a giant rock-like creature, back  flipping off the thing to take up a defensive position in front of a  familiar redhead.</p>
<p><em>How come these two  are always right in the middle of any trouble?!</em></p>
<p>Jumping from Duran’s  back, I ran towards the two girls, my Child close behind after he had  returned to his normal form. I watched as the Orphan reared back, and  I quickly summoned my element to blast off one of its four arms  before he could try to extend it towards my fellow HiMEs.</p>
<p>“Kuga-san!” Mai  yelled out.</p>
<p>“Damn, I was too  late,” I whispered to myself. It seemed like I had been saying that  a lot lately…Was I slacking off?</p>
<p>Before I could even  address my own questioning thought, the monster took a giant step,  successfully shaking the earth and sending both Mai and Mikoto  flying. I shot another round at the thing to try to divert it’s  attention so the two could recover, and it worked a little too well  as the Orphan decided to strike out at me next. Duran and I easily  dodged the assault and promptly made our way over to the others.</p>
<p>“Hey, summon your  Child,” I ordered Mai.</p>
<p>“Don’t be  ridiculous!” she shot back at me.</p>
<p>“Do you want to get  the guests out front involved?!”</p>
<p><em>Sure</em>, I was  worried about the rest of the guest…Shizuru just happened to be at  the very top of that list…</p>
<p>“You’re kidding,  aren’t you? What are you going to do if that Kagutsuchi starts  going berserk?”</p>
<p>“What’s the point  of making a contract with something you can’t control?!” I  retorted, clearly agitated by this point.</p>
<p>“It couldn’t have  been helped!” the redhead protested.</p>
<p>Our little dispute was  interrupted when the Orphan decided to stomp at us again, sending all  three of us soaring backwards. As soon as we landed, the rock monster  positioned itself to crush us with his palm. I watched in horror as  the grey object of my imminent demise came rocketing down towards me,  and I tightly shut my eyes.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly…</p>
<p><em><strong>Crash!</strong></em></p>
<p>I could feel little  pebbles of rubble pounding against my body and I instinctively  brought my arms up to shield myself. When I finally opened my eyes, a  voice rang through my ears, but I couldn’t locate the source  immediately, leaving me to confusedly swivel my head back and forth  in search of the source.</p>
<p>“Orphan, an existence  that threatens mankind. Men spend days in agony from the fear.  However, a girl with a passionate heart has arrived from among  them…Her name is…HiME of the Violent Wind, Sugiura Midori!”</p>
<p>I gazed on, absolutely  dumbfounded as I stared at the proprietor of the little speech I had  just heard.</p>
<p><em>Is she  really…striking a pose…?</em></p>
<p>“Eh! Midori-chan?!”  Mai exclaimed in absolute shock, pointing at the woman in question.</p>
<p><em>Don’t tell me you  know this person too…why do they all have to be so weird?!</em></p>
<p>Not two seconds later,  said weird person was standing right in front of us, somehow using  the Orphan as a path from the cliff she had just previously been  standing on.</p>
<p>“You’re all too  naïve,” the woman continued her spill, “It’s our duty as  HiMEs to save the world from Orphans. Hesitation in the face of evil  is unnecessary. Quarrelling with a teammate is the last thing you  want to do! There are key words to saving the world…They are  justice, love, and friendship!”</p>
<p>“Friendship?” Mai  repeated as she, Mikoto and I proceeded to exchange skeptical looks.</p>
<p>“Well fine. Leave  this to me,” the golden-eyed HiME professed. “Come out, Iron  Fang! Gakutenou!”</p>
<p>The woman slammed her  halberd into the ground and the wind around us instantaneously picked  up. A small tornado formed before our eyes, and when I dispersed, a  striking red and yellow beast stood in its place.</p>
<p>“Gakutenou?” the  rest of us echoed at the sight of the Child.</p>
<p>The thing didn’t look  like any animal in particular. It had a general body like any  four-legged creature. Its head was practically a lance, a yellow tail  sat atop this that ended with a similar structure as the head, and it  had three giant grey spikes emitting from both of its shoulders.</p>
<p>It was what happened  next that surprised me. I watched as the thing transformed into a  chariot of sorts at the woman’s command, sprinting at full speed as  she launched herself onto it’s back. The Child dashed forward…and  right through the Orphan, leaving a hole right in the middle of the  monster that exploded immediately afterwards. The woman dismounted  and struck yet another victory pose.</p>
<p>“Justice wins!” the  HiME professed, her hand in a fist as she watched on.</p>
<p><em>She’s a good  fighter, this Midori, but…she sure does like to talk…and pose…a  lot…</em></p>
<p>“Midori-chan…”  Mai mumbled.</p>
<p>The dark orange haired  woman turned and approached us, “Ah! Mai-chan, I didn’t know a  fellow co-worker was a HiME as well. And your friends here are too,  huh?”</p>
<p>“Well…yeah…”  the busty girl replied somewhat sheepishly while rubbing the back of  her neck.</p>
<p>“And you two are?”</p>
<p>“This is Minagi  Mikoto,” Mai answered for the dark haired girl who quietly nodded.</p>
<p>I squinted when the  woman turned to me next, “Kuga.”</p>
<p>“Kuga…?”</p>
<p>I sighed in annoyance,  “Natsuki.”</p>
<p>Midori then stepped  forward and threw her arm around my shoulder with a wide grin on her  face. Needless to say, my own visage was nowhere near mirroring hers…</p>
<p>“Well, well! Looks  like we’re all teammates in the battle against the Orphans now. How  about we go get acquainted over a couple of beers, what do you say?  The first round’s on me!”</p>
<p>I harrumphed as I  shoved her arm off of me, “If you haven’t noticed, the rest of us  are under age.”</p>
<p>“What’s beer?” I  heard Mikoto inquire and Mai, being the big sister that she was, was  quick to spaz and try to explain to the younger girl that it was  something <em>“bad”</em> and <em>“to never be consumed…EVER”.</em></p>
<p>I had to admit that the  thought of that animalistic girl totally intoxicated made me shudder  as well.</p>
<p>“You guys are no  fun,” Midori complained, “You need to learn to live a little!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s the  idea…” I muttered as I massaged my temples.</p>
<p>“Besides, Mikoto and  I need to get back to the ceremony anyway,” Mai returned with an  avid excuse.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah! There is a  wedding today, isn’t there? Mind if I come along?” Midori asked.</p>
<p>“Um…I-I guess…”  the redhead stuttered out, obviously not thinking it was her place to  invite this random person to someone else’s wedding.</p>
<p>“Thanks! What about  you Ku—Kuga? Hey, where are you going?”</p>
<p>“Home!” I yelled  back over my shoulder as I continued to walk away as quickly as  possible.</p>
<p><em>And I though Mai and Mikoto were a handful…</em></p>
