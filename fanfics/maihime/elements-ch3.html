At a soft beeping sound, Shizuru woke up from the peaceful slumber. Her 
eyes opened slowly and adjusted to the soft light that was coming from a 
couple of small windows near the kitchen area.

Not wanting to wake up the other girl, Shizuru tried to reach for the 
alarm clock. When she began to move her right arm, she found it 
entangled with something. As her senses and memory started to kick in, 
she remembered that Natsuki had wrapped her hands over her waist, and 
later on that night Shizuru laced her fingers within Natsuki&#39;s.

Change of plans; Shizuru stopped the beeping with her other hand that 
was slipped in-between a pillow and the bed. It took some shifting and a 
moment to get her hand over to the clock and press down firmly on the 
&#145;off&#39; button.

Shizuru then slide back into Natsuki&#39;s warmth. Smiling at herself, she 
relaxed and was about to fall asleep again until she felt the hand that 
was wrapped around her grow in strength around her waist.

After a slight turn and some adjusting, Natsuki had chin resting in her 
free hand&#39;s palm. Natsuki was watching Shizuru until collapsing back 
down onto the bed with her face buried in a mess of pillow and two 
colors of hair. And muffled grunt was heard, and soon following was a 
giggle from the other girl.

Natsuki raised her head up again and leaned over Shizuru to look in her 
face, &quot;What are you laughing about,&quot; Natsuki said as she rested her head 
on the other side of Shizuru.

Natsuki was now over Shizuru, not much of them were actually touching at 
this point. Shizuru decided that Natsuki was definitely not awake. 
Natsuki was resting her head, upside down, on the other side of Shizuru 
and closed her eyes.

All of a sudden Natsuki&#39;s body collapsed on Shizuru. A gasp and a 
muffled &#145;huh&#39; was heard from both parties.

Then a fit of giggles was shared with each other.

------

After finally getting out of bed and shivering from the morning cold, 
they both found a form of warmth, may it be a sweater or blanket, they 
both walked over to the other end of cabin.

Shizuru started the stove with a pan over it. Natsuki just sat down, 
shivering and wrapped in a blanket.

Cracking three eggs into a separate bowl, Shizuru started mixing the 
eggs together and added various spices into the creamy-yellow mix.

After a while, Shizuru added the mixture onto the heated pan and 
watched, as the combination equaled a hissing sound.

------

Natsuki was served first: eggs with a side of toast. Natsuki was tempted 
to put mayo on the poor bread, but realized that she forgot to bring 
any. What is wrong with me? Natsuki asked herself when she remembered 
this.

Shortly after, Shizuru sat down across the table from Natsuki and began 
on her eggs and bread. &quot;If you want seconds, there is some still left on 
the pan. It&#39;s not much, but I rather not waste,&quot; Shizuru looked over at 
the pan.

Natsuki got up and scrapped the rest of the eggs onto her plate after 
getting the hint.

After breakfast was eaten and dishes put in the sink, both figures were 
seen working on the deck.

The boat already had its anchor up and facing towards the wind with both 
girls hauling the mail sail up.

------

Natsuki at the wheel, the day was yet again, another perfectly windy 
day.

Shizuru was grabbing things from underneath the deck and came out, 
handing Natsuki a cool bottle of water.

------

Around noon the two of them found themselves nearing a harbor. Natsuki 
only drove, whereas Shizuru showed Natsuki were to go.

Once they reached the unfamiliar harbor, they docked. Getting off, they 
went into a local restaurant that was famous for it&#39;s great food and 
even better desserts- Juilleret&#39;s. As they went into the restaurant, 
they sat down at the next available two-person booth.

A rather large waitress came around asking for their order; Natsuki was 
content with her glass of water, whereas Shizuru asked for a cup of 
oolong green tea.

The waitress nodded and scribbled something down and went on her way.

Natsuki was looking over the menu, while Shizuru was looking over 
Natsuki.

------

When the waitress came back, she handed Shizuru her tea and asked if 
they were ready to order. Both nodding; Natsuki asked for a Big J Club, 
and Shizuru said she was fine.

------

Natsuki was use to eating alone with Shizuru by now. This was a fast 
food restaurant, even though Shizuru choose it, but that was on 
Natsuki&#39;s behalf, and Shizuru barely ate anything that was similar to 
fast food.

Once the food was at their table, Natsuki began to chow down on her 
sandwich.

------

After lunch the two started to walk around the small and peaceful town. 
Only window-shopping. Shizuru tried to get Natsuki into several shops 
that didn&#39;t quiet quit her taste...

------

After an hour on the town, Natsuki ran to the boat in a panic as Shizuru 
was walking calmly towards the boat with several bags in her hands.

Once Shizuru boarded the boat she went into the cabin where Natsuki was, 
&quot;Ara, Natsuki, you could have helped me carry some of my bags,&quot; Shizuru 
said mockingly.

Natsuki was on the bed, huddled against the side of the boat, &quot;Not with 
that kind of name for a store!&quot; she yelled pointing at a bag in 
Shizuru&#39;s hand that read in dark letters: Lesbian Incorporated.

Shizuru, faking a hurt face she looked down at the bag and sniffled a 
bit. Natsuki took the bait. She stood up and walked over to Shizuru, 
&quot;I-I didn&#39;t mean it like that. You know I love you,&quot; Natsuki muttered 
the last part as she pulled Shizuru into a tight hug.

Shizuru, taking the moment, pushed Natsuki off of her and pushed her 
onto a cushion seat that conveniently behind Natsuki. Straddling 
Natsuki, Shizuru was not looking down at the girl and cupped the sides 
of Natsuki&#39;s face softly. Pulling Natsuki into a sweet and slow kiss.

Once Shizuru released her victim, Natsuki had her eyes closed and a 
major change in the color of her cheeks. Shizuru pulled away from her, 
leaving Natsuki dumbfounded at the sudden actions of lust, and leaving 
her somewhat desiring more, but Shizuru knew Natsuki would never ask for 
it.

Shizuru just smirked all the way up to the deck to get them out of the 
harbor before 2 o&#39;clock.

------

Shizuru was driving at this time when Natsuki went over to the bow of 
the boat and looked at the open water.

Sighing from the sheer beauty of the water, Natsuki turned her attention 
to Shizuru, who was busy pulling in the main sail and thought the same 
thing.

------

&quot;Natsuki, will you put the anchor in the water,&quot; a Kyoto voice rang 
through out the entire ship.

&quot;Are we stopping for today here?&quot; Natsuki&#39;s voice was heard as her head 
popped up, looking at their surroundings: there was an island like place 
that was only a short swim away.

&quot;Yup. But, we&#39;re going to go to visit that island, so, once we anchor 
we&#39;re heading out of the dinghy.

Dinghy? Natsuki looked around and saw nothing that looked like a dinghy.

------

Anchor down and so was the dinghy, which was attached to the back of the 
boat. The dinghy was pretty small, but was pretty fast.

------

Once they reached the shore of the small island, Natsuki hopped off and 
helped Shizuru. Afterwards, both pulled the dinghy onto the shore with a 
couple of mighty pulls, mainly Natsuki.

Shizuru started to walk off when the dark haired girl was finished. 
There weren&#39;t that many people on the island, but it was rather popular 
in the summer. A tourist hotspot.

Shizuru found the local jeep trail, which was a trail that lead all the 
way around the island. There were several trails that went off of it to 
various locations on the island; it just all depended on where you 
wanted to go.

In this case, Shizuru took a left, following the jeep trail. With 
Natsuki following her, Shizuru kept up the lead with a rather fast pace.

------

After a long while of walking and talking, Shizuru cut off the jeep 
trail onto another walking path. It lead downhill, but eventually 
leveled out.

------

After more walking, Natsuki was starting to get annoyed by this trail 
that lead nowhere. Noticing this, Shizuru grabbed Natsuki&#39;s hand and 
laced her fingers through hers. Hoping this would preoccupy her long 
enough.

Shizuru thought right. Natsuki suddenly blushed at the new feeling 
between her fingers. She liked it, but turned her head away from it- 
embarrassed about it.

------

After five minutes of more walking, &quot;We&#39;re here,&quot; Shizuru said as she 
pulled Natsuki off onto another, steeper path that lead downwards.

At first Natsuki thought that there wasn&#39;t anything down this path until 
she heard the gentle roar of water.

Once they reached the nice waterfall, Natsuki looked at the small lake 
reached 20 yards from where the waterfall started. It was beautiful.

Shizuru released Natsuki&#39;s hand and was already striping.

Natsuki, shocked at first, but then remembered that she had a bathing 
suit underneath. Wow. I feel stupid she commented to herself after 
striping herself of her shirt and jeans to reveal a dark-blue bikini.

Shizuru was wearing a dark-purple bikini with a square design on it.

------

Once they both got into the water, Shizuru started to war. Splashing 
Natsuki innocently with the lukewarm water in her face.

Natsuki didn&#39;t like this one bit, she turned towards Shizuru, a glare in 
her eyes as she disappeared underneath the water&#39;s surface. Shizuru felt 
a grip on her feet and she was pulled into the deeper waters by and 
unknown force.

When Shizuru surfaced, she saw Natsuki facing her poised to splash water 
in her face and had only moments to shield her face before the battle 
began.

Shizuru splashed back. Giggles could be heard throughout the whole lake.

------

After both had admitted neither would win and shook hands, Shizuru was 
seen to be floating towards the waterfall.

Natsuki was following her subconsciously. And watched the other girl 
reach a small thing of rocks on one of the sides of the waterfall and 
lift herself up and out of the water. Beckoning to Natsuki, the 
dark-haired girl found herself out of the water.

Shizuru walked behind the waterfall and in a small cave. At first 
Natsuki thought Shizuru had disappeared but was grabbed by the wrist by 
a hand that lead her into the small cave.

------

Natsuki marveled at the structure of the cave. It lead not to far back, 
but there was a small pool at the end of the cave. Shizuru walked over 
to the pool and hopped in, &quot;Natsuki, follow me, okay?&quot; Shizuru then 
disappeared under the pool&#39;s surface. When she didn&#39;t come back, Natsuki 
walked over to the pool.

&quot;A tunnel?&quot; Natsuki said as she hesitantly got down into the pool.

She took a deep breath and started to swim the one-way tunnel until 
light was seen shimmering towards a surface. Natsuki followed the light 
until breathing in a deep breath of fresh air.

The dark-haired girl pulled herself out of the pool to see Shizuru 
looking at her, &quot;Ara, I thought Natsuki would have been quicker. I was 
starting to think you had drown,&quot; she teased.

Rolling her eyes at the comment, Natsuki walked over where Shizuru was 
sitting; which was a small wooden bench that was most likely placed 
there by the owner of the island.

There were large, think candles lighting up the chamber. Some where 
getting close to its end, others looked like they were just lit, but 
their purpose all served well.

Shizuru snuggled up next to Natsuki and rested her head on her shoulder. 
Natsuki wrapped her arm around her, bringing Shizuru closer to her. 
Natsuki could feel Shizuru&#39;s wet skin against hers, then she realized 
that both of them were in only bikinis, which were as close to underwear 
as you could get. She felt a heat rise up onto her cheeks, but luckily 
Shizuru was resting her head on her shoulders. Then suddenly, a hand ran 
across Natsuki&#39;s stomach. Blazing a trail of fire and ice with every 
touch until it rested on the other side of Natsuki&#39;s side.

There they sat in silence, one bewitched by the beautiful of the chamber 
and the more beautiful girl sitting next to her, whereas the other one 
was blushing and over thinking too many things at once to notice any 
true beauty.

------

After a while, Shizuru looked at her watch and with a saddened 
expression on her face and in her heart, let go of her precious thing, 
&quot;We should be heading back,&quot; the Kyoto voice pierced through the 
silence.

Natsuki only nodded as her eyes followed Shizuru&#39;s sleek body climb into 
the water and disappear.

------

Once both figures were on the beach where they had last seen the dinghy 
at, fully clothed.

They pushed the dinghy into the water and talked about the island and 
how Shizuru knew about it.

------

Once they tied the dinghy up to the back of the boat again they walked 
into the cabin, dead tired. Took tired to make a full meal, so Shizuru 
made a quick microwavable dinner for the both of them.

They fell asleep in the same manner they had the previous night. But 
this time, they both were facing each other.</pre>
