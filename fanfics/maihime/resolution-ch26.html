<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Dark.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Dark. <em>Dark. </em>Dark. <em>Dark. </em>Dark.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Dark.  The world is dark and rough. The world rubs against her unpleasantly,  making her gorge rise from the feeling which is both rough and slimy.   That the slime which coats the world is her own sweat and bile never  occurs to her, though it has only been twenty minutes since she  vomited, and her breathing is stinted and difficult, the air is so  thick. The air is rotten, too.  It smells like people have died where  she is.  It smells like more people will die.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  world grates at her small thighs, underneath her crotch and butt, and  out behind her. The world digs into her wrists, which have ceased  writhing since she vomited.  Now the only things moving in this room  are her mouth and her small, flat chest, which will probably begin  sprouting small breasts in the next year. Looking into this world,  nothing can be seen; not even the way her mouth slowly forms words;  one, single word, in fact. Listening closely, it is a series of three  syllables, repeated in close tandem, but none of them are clear  enough to understand.  Only that she is speaking them without  stopping, and that she seems to have placed everything in these three  syllables.  Soon, perhaps, even they will stop as the air becomes too  thick for her small lungs, already tightened from the smoke she has  inhaled.  She will not die, but she will feel as though she might  when the coughs begin to rack her small body.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  world digs into her back.  There are splinters on the world, and she  has found them; one was large and caused her to bleed slightly. All  of them sting, and they will sting more when she begins to cough,  quickly tensing and relaxing the muscles in her back which are now  stuck full of wooden slivers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  world is hard and cold on her legs and buttocks.  A single, brave  insect crawls near her left thigh, and she knows that she will kill  it when it nears; perhaps it knows it too, because it keeps its  distance.  Perhaps it is waiting for her to die. Perhaps it is used  to this routine.  The world probably has more insects than this  one—she can hear them skittering somewhere, though she does not  know precisely where—the world has a powerful echo to it.  Even the  sound of her breathing, ragged though it may be, is amplified many  times over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She does  not know if the world will feed her or not.  She has not been in this  world for more than eight hours, and her stomach is growling but she  knows she can survive for at least another day without food.  Water,  on the other hand…she expects that somebody will feed her in this  world.  Otherwise, she will probably end up gnawing at her own flesh.   Perhaps this will free her anyway.  This does not seem overly morbid  to her.  Very little seems overly morbid to her.  Perhaps nothing  does. She is a tough girl at heart, and that is why she exists in the  world.  Because she is tough, and somebody is afraid.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  thinks, in that small part of her mind which has not shut itself off,  conserving energy and waiting, that they have every reason to be  afraid. She knows this because of the small tickle that is not only  in her heart or stomach or head, but is in all three of those places  and everywhere else on her body. It is a tickle which is a bit  similar to licking a live wire which is connected to a dying double-A  battery; surprising at first, not particularly pleasant, but  at the  same time, if only faintly…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Powerful.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  feels it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It will  not be long now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  continues whispering.  Three syllables.  Three syllables. Three.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Over and  over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not long  now.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Aoi  Senou had only seen three people since she had woken up, and none of  them had been Chie Harada; that in and of itself was disturbing, but  it made sense in a sick sort of way; she was being swapped around,  her cellmates controlled by some arcane schedule whose contents and  purpose she could not even guess at. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After all, if we’re being  held here, they can do whatever they want to us, and I should be  grateful that they haven’t. </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What  really bothered her were the screams.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  were two distinct people screaming not far off—or maybe very far  off. Their captivity was being perpetuated in a place which was  overall fairly modern—white plastic on the walls, unfathomable  machines everywhere—but it still echoed like a castle.  The worst  of it was that while they were both female screams, she had no idea  whose they were. Peoples screams were not related to their voices,  not really—she could not listen, and then after a moment, say, “Oh.  That one is Chie. That other one is Natsuki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What it  boiled down to, in the end, was that she had absolutely no idea if  they were torturing Chie.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t even know if Chie was still alive.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>After  the blast, I thought we were dead. That helicopter seemed as big as  the sun—the men wearing the patch that’s all over the walls here  pulled me out and shot it down, and I guess maybe we’d be dead  otherwise, but I don’t really know. I passed out…I think.  Or I  was stuck with something.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t think she was, though.  Nothing ached as though it had been  roughly jabbed, and she knew that if she had been gently pricked,  she’d have seen it coming. Aoi Senou was sometimes called a flake,  but she was one of the more observant women that Chie knew—second  only to Chie herself, she was sometimes told.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  first cellmate had been Yuuichi Tate.  That had been awkward at best,  but it would have been worse if he was fully conscious.  They were  keeping him fairly pumped with drugs, probably because his entire  left arm was in a cast which had a fairly consistent red stain on its  underside. They hadn’t told either of them what was wrong, but Aoi  had a fairly good idea; it didn’t take a lot of thinking about,  really.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  current cellmate was Mai.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai did  not look well.  She had not been injured, (though none of them—to  Aoi’s knowledge—had gotten out without their share of cuts and  minor burns) but she looked as though she had been in and out of  World War One in the time she had been absent. Aoi had tried twice to  talk to the girl, but Mai had not even looked up at her.  She had  simply stayed where she was, half-past fetal, and stared at the place  she had come from. This had concerned Aoi far more than the blood  dried on the girl’s shirt near her hip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even  worse than that, though, if such a thing was possible, was the girl’s  flesh. It was completely covered in gooseflesh so thick that it  looked as though the girl had developed a hide of skin-covered  scales.  It was cold and hard to the touch; and there was something  else;<br />
      <em>had  to be coincidence</em><br />
  it had  almost seemed like it was charged with electricity. She had touched  Mai each time she had attempted to speak with her, and both times she  had received static shocks that had actually sparked in the air. Her  memory was dulled by the sheer surprise of the thing, but she could  swear that she lost feeling in the limb for a solid ten seconds  after, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Coincidence.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Where  would she even </em>get <em>that kind of shock?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Stupid  coincidence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  does that make Reito, then?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Stupid  coincidence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It felt  a little like somebody was pushing these thoughts into her head.  Aoi  Senou was not a person who believed in coincidence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Stupid  coincidence.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another  scream. Aoi dug her fingernails into her palm without thinking about  it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chie,”  she whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Reito  looked like Mai does, only minus the shell-shock. He looked like he  was just…exhausted. </em>Like he had just come back from a  five-hour bout of getting his ass kicked by a sumo wrestler, only  minus the bruises and streak marks.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No,  that’s not quite right.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  wasn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  closer to the truth to say that he looked as though he was still in  the ring.  Still standing, eighteenth round, and sorry, folks,  bellringer’s taken ill with the flu, so let’s all enjoy the show,  shall we?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi  almost shrieked in shock.  Mai’s voice was haggard and raspy, but  it was still a veritable delight to hear.  Chie began to slide  herself towards the girl, but as she neared her to put a supportive  arm around her (Aoi would never outwardly admit that she simply<em> needed a hug, </em>but she did and she goddamn well knew it) a spark <em>snapped </em>in the air between them and she jerked backwards with  a muffled cry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai,  moving slowly, looked up at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mai,”  Aoi whispered.  “What the hell is going on?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai only  smiled emptily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please,”  Aoi said.  “Tell me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  shook her head with the resigned look of a woman facing a firing  squad.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  want to help,” Aoi said. “I want to do something. I want to” <em>find Chie </em>“…help.”  She felt that little tug at her,  the little thorn in the side of her sanity.  That little niggle that  threatened to reduce her into a screaming, drooling puddle.  It  almost seemed like that would be a relief. Probably it would.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi  wouldn’t let it happen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not with  the screams.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not when  those screams could still be <em>her.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Never.  And she would be dipped and fucked if she would let one shell-shocked  girl—what her father would have called a <em>numb broad</em>, much to  her mother’s discontent—drag her down, even if it was Mai.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi  stood up.  She walked to where Mai lay, and offered her hand to the  girl.  Mai looked at it numbly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take  it.” Aoi’s voice rang of the kind of sturdiness that allowed her  to tell herself that she was fighting the insanity. After all, when  placed in conditions which should drive a person insane, what could a  person do? Go insane, or toughen up and fight.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  father had said that, too.  He had been a good man, no matter what  his mother had said. No matter what anybody had said. And she would  be good too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even if  it wound up being her next time in those chambers, screaming as they  did God-knew-what to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take  it,” she repeated. “We’re leaving.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  can’t.”  Mai made a compelling argument. They <em>were </em>surrounded  on all sides by plastic, and probably behind that, metal.  Aoi,  however, like a good bastion of strength, ignored this argument.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  are. Maybe not now, and maybe not for a long time, but we certainly  won’t get anywhere sitting down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is  it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  truth was, Aoi thought in some dark recess of her mind that Mai had  gone insane.  That she<em> had </em>gone insane a long time ago, and  that the happy, carefree Mai that she had been with after her first  year at Fuuka academy and through most of the summer was a sham, a  façade that cracked on a whim.  The strong Mai was either gone  or hidden, and she knew of maybe two people who knew where it had  gone. It hurt her a little, knowing she wasn’t one of them, but not  much, because she was assured in that Mai still cared for her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  all, she still loved Mai.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  you, Chie. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’ll  come for you.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take  it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  sound like a samurai. Didn’t they always wind up dying gloriously  or committing suicide? Hell, you don’t even know how to punch a man  without jamming your wrist, and I doubt seriously if any of the  black-clad bastards here would care much for you slapping them like a  wounded lover. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If I  were a samurai, I could get out of this joint.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  stopped that train of thought there—self-doubt would get her  nowhere. She had what she had, and what she had would do. Wasn’t  that what Chie always said?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Or  was that you?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Don’t  really care. Sounds too naïve to work in the real world anyway,  but fuck it, this hardly seems like the real world to me.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  shock you again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  that’s true,” Aoi said, “I’ll deal wi—” she stopped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  walls.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Covered  with plastic, yes, but also with machines. Arcane machinery that  looked like it belonged either in the future or the distant past.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi  thought out loud.  “If that’s true, then I think there’s  something to this place after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  looked almost vexed.  The scream again, and she flinched, and so did  Aoi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  is that, do you think?” Aoi tried to speak casually, but it came  out strangled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  shook her head. “Don’t want to think about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi got  the feeling that she would have to, like it or not, and in the near  future.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then Mai  took her hand, and she felt her entire arm go numb. Her face  contorted and she let out an agonized cry, but she made sure that Mai  was standing before she let go and dropped to the ground, clutching  her dead arm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At this,  Mai’s face immediately gained some semblance of life, as though the  worry-lines she had acquired over the past year had suddenly reformed  themselves, transforming her, like a veritable attractive female  Pinocchio, into a real girl. “Are you okay?” she asked, but made  no move to help Aoi. This was probably wise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  tailbone hurt, but Aoi was otherwise okay. She stood tenderly and  gave a V-for-victory.  “Just dandy,” she said as brightly as she  could manage. Feeling started to return to her arm almost  immediately, which helped.<strong> “</strong>Feel like I’m drowning, but  you know.” This was, in fact, a clever way of changing the subject,  from <em>we’re in a prison cell </em>to <em>my, this is hot weather,  don’t you think?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  just blinked at her.  “What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  hot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And?  We’re in a prison cell.” Mission failed. <em>Fission mailed.  Excuse me, sir, I believe that I have a split atom for delivery to  this address, if you’ll just sign here, please? Fission delivered.  What?</em> Aoi couldn’t help herself; she began to crack up.  The  tension in the room broke immediately, and a minute later, Mai began  to laugh too, hard; her eyes were red and her lips were chapped and  her T-shirt was bathed in sweat and there was a splotch of red on one  of her breasts that Aoi thought ought to have been cleaned up after  the explosion but she was <em>laughing. </em> Her eyes squeezed shut  and she laughed harder than it seemed she had ever laughed before, so  hard it hurt, and after a while it wasn’t even because it was  funny; she was trying to laugh away the fact that she was in a prison  cell and Yuuichi might have been dead <em>and hell he was already dead  once I practically killed him what’s one more time to have him dead  and Mikoto is God-knows-where and we’re probably all going to die  in this stinking shitpot and Natsuki is dead and god it feels like my  lungs are going to explode but not before my heart thumps out of my  chest and my brain pounds so hard that it mashes itself to jelly and </em>Mai was crying now, and Aoi could not move to touch her, to  comfort her, because a direct shock like Mai was putting out right  now—it actually crackled in the air as she cried—applied to her  heart might have killed her.  And that by itself killed Aoi a little;  the urge to go to her, to hug her, to comfort her as she had once, a  long time ago, was almost overpowering, and it was taking every ounce  of her strength to keep herself from moving. Tears began to leak out  of Aoi’s eyes to match Mai’s, and that was the best she could do.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But all  the while, she thought.  She considered.  She planned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">By the  end, she thought she had something workable.  If not for escape, then  at least for information.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  had, after all, left them alone in a cell with a lot of very  expensive equipment.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Midori  looked like <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">shit. </span></em>When she had asked Aoi to tell her how she  looked, openly and honestly, that was what Aoi had said. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">You look  like shit, Midori. </span></em>It was true, of course. Midori’s left leg  was broken and in a cast and her right wrist didn’t seem to want to  move more than a few degrees in either direction—<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">that </span></em>wasn’t  in a cast. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Funny. I thought I just fixed one of these, </span></em>she had  thought when she first realized that she could barely feel anything  below it. Her right eye was sealed shut by a giant bruise. She didn’t  look like she had been in a vehicle accident; she looked like she had  had the shit beaten out of her and then forced back into her.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  for all of that, Reito looked even worse.  With nary a scratch on  him, Reito looked the worst.  Worry lines had developed out of  nowhere on his brow; his look was haggard and his hair had been  shaved in the back, revealing a bumpy patch of skin which was  slightly pale but mostly red, as though it had been shaved not so  much with a buzzer as with a garden edger.  His eyes were red and  bloodshot, and they never seemed to blink, and when nobody was  talking to him, his face slowly worked its way downwards until he was  staring straight-on at the plastic floor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  had tried, for the first half-hour of their confinement together, to  talk to him. By that point he was nearing his 37th round  with near-world Sumo champion Hideto Tsushima, back from his  year-2000 loss and intent on working his way to the top. He had done  his best to be as jovial as he could, but he came off to her more  like a dying dog, trying to lick its owner’s face one more time  before it finally died, than anything else.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  that, she had slid into silence without too much argument. It was  hard, because she was doing her ample best not to think too much  about the situation that they were in; in part, because she had  already given it a mental once-over when she was in the cell with  Aoi, who had actually contributed, and in part because she knew she  had a good imagination, which had already threatened to tell her what  it thought about her fate—strung up, maybe with chains, maybe just  tied to a chair—naked, arcane machines sticking out of her flesh at  odd angles, being violated one last time before they threw her in the  scrap heap because she was as useless as the machines stuck in her  hair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No.  None of that. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Wait.  What?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori’s  head snapped up.  She tried to stand from where she had been sitting,  but was, of course, unable to. Each time she had been moved, there  had been black-clad soldiers, their faces covered by somehow  threatening gas-masks, to carry her to a wheelchair.  They had  blindfolded her for the trip, so she hadn’t seen a single part of  her captor’s stronghold that they hadn’t wanted her to see. For  all she knew, she could be in the converted bathroom of a fucking  train station in Yokohama.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Reito,”  she said quietly. He didn’t seem to notice, so she said it louder.  “<em>Reito. </em>Perk up, buddy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  looked up at her, slowly, and she was struck by how rapidly his face  had aged in the past half hour. He looked like he’d been through a  decade of salaryman’s work.  “Wh…” he breathed heavily, as  though it was difficult.  “What is it, Midori?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let  me see your skull again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  looked at her askew. “What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  can’t move, so slide on over here and face the wall.” Her leg and  wrist sometimes blinded her with agony, but her mother had always  told her that if she could push an oversized, soon-to-be redheaded  baby out her cunt, then Midori could damn well take some knocking  around if she had to.  This was usually after she had slapped her for  being petulant or some other bullshit. For some reason, this had  stuck with her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly,  Reito complied, without question. He even managed a half-cocked  smile. A few seconds later, he was sitting in front of Midori, who  was sitting leaned against a wall.  She pushed aside the small net of  hair which had fallen over the bald patch, and then touched that lump  of skin very gently. Reito flinched in pain, and when he did, his  head pressed into Midori’s fingers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  kept herself from gasping, but it was a close thing, as her fingers  pressed into something that could only be solid metal hiding thinly  beneath skin.  She felt its sharp ridges and pins, could almost feel  the cold, unforgiving metal it was composed of.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Reito,”  she whispered. “What the hell did they do to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly,  Reito turned to face her, and the dry expression on his face had been  replaced by something which was half-insane, a made-up grin like a  clown’s face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  trying, Midori,” he said. “I promise I’m trying to keep it out,  so please don’t touch it, it reminds me that it’s there and then  it’s harder to keep it out.”  Saying that, he, like most of his  friends had at some point in the past two hours, began to cry.  Tears  flowed out of his eyes, silent and steady; they were eyes which  begged for help in a way that Midori could never bring herself to  believe that Reito was capable of.  He looked like a doll or a child  who had been hit one too many times and had come to believe that  every raised arm was waiting to hit him, every loud noise was the  sound of somebody barreling down the stairs to punish him. He looked  like that child at a sporting event, where everybody was jumping out  of their seats and flailing their arms around.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  looked like something Midori had once seen in a mirror.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  could not think of anything better to do, and so she took him in her  arms and held him as he cried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sometime  shortly after he regained himself, he told her what he was keeping  out—really, he felt better after crying, as is often the case—and  then held her as she screamed, not in fright or agony but in rage and  frustration, her screams echoing alongside those of whoever was being  so ruthlessly tormented outside.</span></p>

Inoue  Nakahara was an excellent negotiator, or at least she considered  herself one.  However, this man was making things extraordinarily  difficult for her. He struck her as a man who had thrust himself into  a position that he was not at all ready for. She did not know that he  felt the same way about himself.  She also thought that he had not  had a drink in several days.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  told you. It’s a simple exchange; a cease fire, and I will present  the girl as collateral to that end. No more fighting, and we both  win.” This was the fifth time he had said something to that end,  and it was always accompanied by a thin scratching sound, as though  he was an absent sort who needed a shave.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">His  compromise sounded promising, and she would have loved to take him up  on it—she didn’t want any more useless skirmishes and attention  drawn to their organization than were necessary—if not for one  simple issue: He was lying through his fucking teeth, and she knew  it. She had done about a billion business deals with “frightened”  terrorists like him, and every time her dumbass superiors had told  her to take the deal, there had always been at least twenty hiding in  bunkers and bushes, waiting to take as many of her comrades with them  as they could. This man was no different; his accent was better, that  was all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your  terms are unconvincing,” she said. “I will not order my men to  drive themselves into a potentially hostile compound, not even to  retrieve the girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And <em>I,</em>” he said, his friendly, jovial voice only amplifying her  annoyance, “will not consent to driving <em>my </em>men into a  potentially hostile compound to drop off such a girl.” Another lie;  they weren’t his men. The Swiss Remnants fought in a very specific  way, and every time she had predicted their moves using this as a  basis, she had been right. It was a very <em>good </em>specific way,  but she was smarter than that, and they didn’t know it, which was  why they lost to an inferior force such as hers. That was why the  brass had sent her out here even with their army only half-formed as  it was, in its initial stages, so to speak: They knew she could do  it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  scratched at the back of her neck, which had been itching all damn  day, and touched her hair absently, which had picked up some sort of  static charge while she was shuffling around the Commander’s office  trying to think of a way to do this without getting too many of hers  killed. She had even shocked the commander when he had tried to touch  her—something she did not feel terribly bad about, since he had  been trying to hop into her pants at the time, and she did not feel  like shooting him down and dealing with his semi-pouty response at  that moment.  He was a genius but he was a child sometimes, and that  bothered her, even if she <em>did</em> love his childish ass.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  we will conduct the exchange in some neutral territory.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  risk having my forces meet a superior force intent on crushing them  just because you decided not to pay my price?” The price—that had  been the other thing. All cease-fires required exchange, he had said,  and since it seemed that they have plenty of money, that would do. <em>They’re not your fucking troops. Stop lying, asshole. </em>“I  think not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  think us so petty?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think you so ruthless, if you’ll forgive me for saying so.”  Scratch. Scratch. Fucking scratch. He was lying through his stubble,  and she could hear it over the goddamn phone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  we have no deal,” Inoue said. “We will talk later today and work  out a compromise, but I warn you that if we do not, you will not be  alive tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nor  will most of you.” He said it with a note of amusement. Calling her  bluff. She didn’t have the force to wipe out a regiment of the  Swiss Remnants, and even if she did, they were notorious for  receiving backup from<em> other </em>Swiss Remnants.  He knew it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  think.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  hoped he didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If he  did, it would be very bloody indeed, and all for one stupid girl who  couldn’t get herself caught like the rest of them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Very  bloody indeed.</span></p>
