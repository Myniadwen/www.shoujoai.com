<a href="../maihime/letter4u-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>My dear friend,

I can&#39;t thank you enough for agreeing to my impossible request. I know 
I&#39;ve said it before, but you were the only one I could ask. Only you 
could understand the need for this sacrifice. Only you have a gaze 
like mine, one that penetrates time. 

Sometimes our feelings can cause us pain, a pain that reaches across 
time and space. Yet our feelings can give us happiness, a joy that 
transcends this world into the next.

When I heard about your recent troubles, I couldn&#39;t help but believe 
it was my fault. If I hadn&#39;t brought you together, you wouldn&#39;t
have to experience this painful parting. However if you had never met 
Tokiha-san, had never known her love and support, you would have 
never gained the strength to do what I&#39;ve asked of you.

Fate. I spent centuries trying to subvert fate. Yet as my ultimate 
goal is achieved I can&#39;t help but wonder if I was playing into Fate&#39;s 
hands all along. After all, if you and Tokiha-san were destined to 
meet and destined to part, perhaps you are destined to meet again.

But this is no time for speculation. I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve found love with 
Kikukawa-san. You&#39;ve finally found a measure of happiness in this 
lifetime, my friend. Hold on to it. I&#39;m afraid you won&#39;t find much 
comfort in the times to come. 

There&#39;s only chance, and my powers of precognition are greatly 
diminished as I leave this place, a chance that the wheel of Fate 
will turn and you&#39;ll meet her again. I&#39;ll not tamper with destiny, but 
when you find her hold fast and never let go. This is my final 
kindness.

Thank you again,

Kazahana Mashiro

Author&#39;s Note: I think I&#39;ll leave it at that. I really enjoyed writing 
this style. Thanks for all the comments and criticisms. And yes, 
Mashiro&#39;s letter does tie-in to a future story. Have fun guessing what 
it&#39;s about.
