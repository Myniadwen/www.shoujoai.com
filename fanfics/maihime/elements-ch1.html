<pre>Thunder

At the low rumble of thunder, people on the street scattered for cover 
as the onslaught of rain came pouring down. Stray animals scurried for 
their makeshift homes until the storm water would carry them away.

Humans, on the other hand, ran for their homes, or the local store, or 
their cars. But in this case, this girl was running for her motorbike.

A short, dark haired girl scrambled to get on her helmet and on her way 
home before the rain would pour harder. Revenging the engine after 
starting it up, the motorcycle was on its way. Splashing puddle water 
into stupid by-standers&#39; face. She raced along the road, hugging every 
curve as adrenaline was coursing through her veins. She could feel her 
heartbeat faster, but she never noticed. This type of thing would happen 
ever week.

------

Another girl nearby that side of town had just caught a taxi and gotten 
in when the rain began to pour down unmercifully on the arrogant people 
outside. This brown haired girl smiled sweetly at the cab driver and 
instructed him where she needed to go too. With a simple nod of 
acknowledgement the cab took off into the slick streets.

They exchanged small talk until an expected awkward silence fell on 
them. The girl in the back was looking out of the foggy and wet window. 
A sigh came out of her mouth as she listened to the pitter-patter of the 
rain. As she closed her eyes and smile slide onto her face. She was 
content with today and was only waiting until she would reach her 
destination.

------

The biker girl had made her way to an intersection. Shivering from the 
unrelenting rain, she hugged herself at a stoplight hoping it would stop 
the cold from becoming colder.

Not much longer and I&#39;ll be back to my apartment. She thought as a 
sudden heat came to her cheeks. Not surprised, just embarrassed, she was 
happy that her helmet hid things like that.

------

The taxi pulled up to a local complex building. It was the best choice 
of all the apartments that were for sale.

The girl climbed out of the taxi gracefully, having paid for the trip 
before opening the door, she headed straight to the canopy that 
protected the entrance from the rain. Slightly damp, the girl walked 
over to the counter where she had left her key. Now that she thought 
about it, the complex was more similar to a hotel. But the residences 
didn&#39;t have to leave the key it was only optional.

She spoke her name: Shizuru Fujino to the man behind the desk and he 
turned around grabbed her key and handed it to her. Departing for her 
building she went to the left side of the stairs and out the right-hand 
door that lead to a walkway balcony that lead to several doors. Each had 
it&#39;s own number in a gold color. After stopping to the number 23, she 
opened the door with the key and headed in. Turning on the lights, the 
room came to life. A soft padding sound came from the living room and 
quickly made it&#39;s way to Shizuru at the front door. After closing the 
door behind her, she found herself engulfed in sloppy licks and kisses 
from a black labrador puppy. Calling the dog by its name, the dog 
settled enough for Shizuru to get to the kitchen and drop off some of 
her bags and keys on the counter. Continuing to move through the living 
room to the bedroom where she plopped onto the nice bed and closed her 
eyes. Thinking.

After a short moment, she willed herself to get up and change out of the 
damp cloths into comfortable dry clothing. With that, she got up and 
made her way to the bathroom to take a quick hot shower.

------

Almost home, the biker girl had to stop by a store to get something 
really quick.

After a few moments she pulled her bike into a parking lot that was 
covered by another layer of the building. Free parking was a nice perk 
that the residence received with their stay.

The biker hopped off the bike once it was turned off. Taking her time to 
take her item out of the storage compartment of the bike, she headed 
towards the indoor elevator.

------

Shizuru sat down on the couch with a hot cup of tea in her hands. The 
dog jumped up and made itself comfortable on the other end of the couch. 
Taking in the sweet aroma of the freshly brewed tea. Shizuru allowed 
herself to indulged in the moment until taking a hot sip of tea. She 
flicked on the TV to see that there wasn&#39;t anything on. Tired from the 
days work, she just had a few more things to attend to before she went 
to bed. One being that she needs to feed her python. Others involved 
waiting, but she was okay with that.

After a while, she turned the TV off and sat on the couch listening to 
the music of rain. It was nice, until a thunderbolt crashed out of the 
sky and gave off a loud boom moments after.

She found herself counting the seconds between the light and the sound. 
4, 5, 6&#133; A crash of came from the sky and she waited for the next 
lightening to strike.

Suddenly the dog got up from his spot and raced for the door. Shizuru 
only turned her head, following his wagging tail.

------

The girl went to the front desk and asked for a key. The man said it was 
already taken and she ran towards the stairs, jumping three at a time. 
She turned right and rushed down the corridor. Walking an all to 
familiar path, she stopped at a door that had the number 23 on it.

With her gift behind her back, she readied herself. Coughing slightly 
she was shivering slightly, she turned the knob and entered the room.

She went to the kitchen and placed down her helmet and keys on the 
counter next to another pair of keys and a purse.

She was meet by a dog at first. Petting him on the head she got an 
encouraging lick on her hand. She then headed towards the couch where 
she saw her.

------

&quot;Natsuki, you&#39;re home early,&quot; she said with a minimal amount of shock in 
her eyes and voice.

------

Natsuki was blushing slightly as she pulled a couple of flowers from 
behind her. Head focused on the ground, she handed them to Shizuru, who 
was in complete shock this time.

Shizuru placed her teacup on the table and took the flowers carefully 
from Natsuki&#39;s hand. Smiling with more content than she had earlier that 
day, she moved past the dark haired beauty to place the flowers in a 
vase of water.

When Shizuru came back, the girl was gone. She heard sounds coming from 
the bedroom; she walked slowly to the doorframe and leaned on the right 
side, looking in on the other girl who was pealing off her very clingy 
biker suit.

&quot;Are you cold?&quot; Natsuki heard as she had the suit already down to her 
waist when she felt warm hands coil themselves around her. Warmth was 
felt again on her cheeks, and she wrapped her hands over the other 
girl&#39;s hands. Leaning back into Shizuru&#39;s body, Natsuki closed her eyes 
and wished she could stay like this for a while, but she needed to take 
a shower.

&quot;I need a shower,&quot; she stated bluntly as she released her hands off of 
Shizuru&#39;s. Feeling the warmth leave her, she quickly undressed. Feeling 
the presence still lingering behind her, she blushed as she hurried to 
the bathroom with a new change of cloths.

------

Natsuki made her way out of the shower still cold and clean. She 
wandered around a while in the bedroom until entering the living room.

She saw Shizuru on the couch with her cup of tea in her hands. Her hair 
was slightly disheveled. This was what Natsuki liked best about her.

Shizuru noticed the new presences in the room and turned to look at 
Natsuki with a loving look and a smile. A real smile.

------

Natsuki looked at her the same way as she made her way over to the couch 
as another rumble of thunder was heard. Neither noticed.

Natsuki sat down next to Shizuru, as the brown haired girl pulled the 
darker haired girl into her lap. Shizuru wrapped her hands around 
Natsuki&#39;s waist and pulled her closer.

The hand that coiled around Natsuki&#39;s waist still held a cup of tea and 
was careful not to spill.

There, they both sat in happiness and content from the warmth they 
shared. Letting each other slowly drift off into a light sleep as the 
sound of thunder drifted away.

Natsuki&#39;s last thoughts were in the form of a wish. A wish that a 
thunderstorm would come everyday.

This is the first of a couple of cute innocent stories about those two. 
I dunno what will happen next, but I think the title will be: Wind. Tell 
me what you think, and I&#39;m sorry for the misspellings.</pre>
