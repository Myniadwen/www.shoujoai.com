<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s  Notes:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No  OOC Here, hopefully. Sadly, I only just finished the series, so the  likelihood of all of my characters being perfectly IC is fairly slim.  I’ll do my best. Please let me know if I’ve slipped up somewhere.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  lot of the supporting characters, such as Chie Harada, are not  well-developed within the series, and thus I have very little to work  with when writing them. They will play relatively important roles in  this story, so I’ll try to take as few liberties with them as I  can, but you’ll see some of my own design in them.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  spite of Japanese culture, names will be written first-last, rather  than the typical Japanese last-first. This is because as somebody who  is not Japanese, it is less confusing for me.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally,  rather than wasting your time by re-introducing characters you  already know, I’m going to skip that phase. This is a specialized  community, and as such, I assume you all know who I’m talking about  when I say “Mai”. You’ll probably get a general physical  description anyway, but don’t be surprised if it’s unintentional.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">You’ll get your kicks…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai Tokiha found herself quietly singing the old tune, familiar to  many but to her still fairly novel, as route 167 from Toba became  route 260 towards Goza. To her, it was really all the same—grass  and sidebar flashed by, there was a slight dip as they took the exit,  and then they were going west instead of south. Still, though, she  found herself thinking of the old American song as the car she was  fairly well crammed into entered the last leg of the journey from  Fuka Gakuen to Goza Shirahama Beach.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On Route sixty-six,” she sang to a car full of dozing students,  a cool window, and an inattentive driver. It was a song she’d come  across not long ago in a round of lightning karaoke; as just another  karaoke song, it should have been like a groupie to a pop star: Used  once and then discarded into the recesses of her mind; but for some  reason, it had stuck with her like few other songs had.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It winds from Chicago to L.A., more than two thousand miles all  the way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something about the perky, jazzy beat had simply enthralled her, the  way few other songs had. Music had a way of doing that—enthralling  her without regard to her “tastes.” She had a feeling it was like  that for everybody; no matter what “kind’ of music you like,  certain songs simply ensnared you, often wonderfully, sometimes  dangerously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Who are those little girls in pain just trapped in castle of dark  side of moon?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yes, often dangerously. She said nothing about it, but that song had  been coming back to haunt her increasingly of late. That song and  that life.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She expected that this, too, was normal. Life had a way of not going  away. No matter how far into the future you looked, life was still  life; indestructible in many ways. The boy sitting in the seat in  front of her was living proof of this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Get your kicks on Route six-six.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Unfortunately, the only kick she was getting here, now, from this  living proof was a soft, somehow defiant snore. She stared at the  back of his head, at the faux-blonde hair spiking inelegantly out in  all directions, and reflected on the fact that this bothered her more  than it probably should have.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She twisted her neck back around to stare out the window of the brown  conversion van that she and eleven other people were squeezed into,  dismissing the thought,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">(“Now you’ll go through Saint Louis, and Joplin Missouri, and  Oklahoma City is mighty pretty,”)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">and felt something small and warm slide around her waist, something a  little larger, and far hairier, press into the back of her neck,  making it itch just a little. She heard a small voice murmur in a  half-asleep stupor, “Mai sings pretty,” before a wet line of what  could only have been drool began a slow decent from the warm hairy  spot into the depths of her orange tank-top. She stifled a yelp and  grimaced, realizing that once Mikoto Minagi was attached to her and  asleep, she was fairly well doomed to this fate until the girl woke  up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And still, her mood, morose at best, did not lift. It had been  nagging at her since<br />
      <em>your life ended</em><br />
  spring break had  started; this melancholy stupor that set in only when she was by  herself. She couldn’t put a name on it, nor could she put a reason,  try as she might, but that didn’t it from dropping her gaze a  little, from demolishing her easy smile, from sinking her shoulders  when nobody was looking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She turned her gaze away from the window and turned the small thing  clinging stoically to her away from her neck and back, allowing her  to bury her head in Mai’s left breast and allowing Mai to lean  against the seat, rest her head for a while. She looked down at  Mikoto fondly, shook her head, and forced it through her  consciousness: <em>You are going on a vacation. You are with everyone.  You are with Yuuichi. You can’t--</em> she stopped, went back. <em>You  are with everyone. You can’t allow yourself to ruin your first  spring break with your friends ever simply because some unknown  depression is nagging at you. Be happy that you’re here at all. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mai,” the braid at her breast murmured, apparently only  nine-tenths asleep, “you stopped singing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honestly,” Natsuki murmured from the left side of their bench,  surprising Mai. “That girl…” Mai hadn’t known that Natsuki  had been awake at all, let alone paying attention to Mai’s  miniature concert. She was resting her head against the window as Mai  had been, but with her eyes closed, her arms folded loosely across  her chest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay,” Mai said, feeling a smile work its way onto her  face without her approval. “I really don’t mind. I’m sorry I  woke you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You didn’t,” Natsuki said, still not looking up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Couldn’t sleep?” <em>Or didn’t want to?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmm. I really enjoyed listening to you sing,” A  shade of a grin appeared, ruining Natsuki’s well-crafted image of  aloofness. “What was it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Route sixty-six. It’s by an American named Nat King Cole.” She  paused a moment to consider whether elaboration would bounce off of  Natsuki’s head or not, decided it probably would, and chose not to  waste her breath.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,” Natsuki said as though Mai had said nothing at all  (proving her point about the rubbery effect of Natsuki’s ears quite  nicely), “don’t let me stop you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wouldn’t want to keep you up,” Mai protested. Karaoke was  one thing; singing privately for somebody quite another, in her mind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like I said, I enjoyed it.  Besides, it’s not every day I’ll  get to hear you sing.” This was a very careful way of saying, <em>Don’t  even think of draging me along on your excursions to that abysmal  hell-pit you call the Karaoke shop. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t think so? Are you feeling all right, Natsuki?” This  was a very careful way of saying, <em>Screw you, you’re coming if I  have to tie you to the back of the van and drag you there. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m feeling fine,” Natsuki said, doing her best to feign  ignorance of the subvocal exchange.  Her voice rose a decibel or two  higher as she concentrated on choosing her words carefully. “I  just can’t think of many places where I would be party to such a  pleasant concert.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai smiled as pleasantly as her concert had apparently been. “I’m sure you’ll be happily surprised at  some point, Natsuki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmm,” Natsuki repeated. “Maybe I will take a nap.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wouldn’t want to keep you up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wake me when we get there.” Natsuki knew full well she would be  doing no napping in this car. Cars made her uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mai,” the small thing at Mai’s bosom protested again. “Sing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai sighed, looked out towards the window again, and did just that:  “You see Amarillo,” she sang, her voice quiet but not unpleasant,  “Gallup, New Mexico; Flagstaff, Arizona; and don’t forget Winona;  Kingsman; Barstow; San Bernardino.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed that bastard of a grin back  on Natsuki’s face, and shook her head, both annoyed and amused, and all at  once her fighting spirit came poking its head out of the layers of dust  it had gathered from months of disuse. <em>Fine, </em>she thought with a little grin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She grabbed Mikoto’s braid and raised it to her mouth like a  microphone—a specific microphone, in her mind. The girl yelped and  jolted awake as Mai suddenly broke full-out into the first cover of  the old Cole classic by a Japanese High School student in stinted  English:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Won’t you get hip to this timely tip: When you make that  California trip, get your kicks…,” Yuuichi’s snoring got a  little bit more insistent: He was awake now; and with him came Shiho,  napping on his shoulder, rubbing at her eyes groggily. Chie Harada  woke easily to find she could barely contain a laugh, and only for  the sake of the girl, Aoi Senou, still napping next to her. “On  route sixty-six.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">From the driver’s seat, Midori Sugiura turned her head  back—dangerously—towards the group and laughed, shouting, “Sing  it, Mai!” She took her hands off of the steering wheel, to the  visible chagrin of Reito Kanzaki, also up front—she was apparently  now steering with her knees—and mimed a saxophone, swaying  erratically in an impersonation of an inebriated jazz artist, and  making bizarre pseudo-instrumental noises.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai felt the physical weight of depression lift off of her chest, and  she laughed and once more pulled Mikoto’s braid towards her lips:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Won’t you get hip to this timely tip: When you make that  California trip, get your kicks…” her voice had increased to a  near shout by this point, and Yuuichi snored a little louder, a  little faster, as though to make up for it. Aoi finally broke out  laughing, and Mai finished, in the booming voice she reserved for the  karaoke stage and the karaoke stage alone, “On ROUUUUUUTE…” she  flicked Yuuichi on the back of the head, and he finally whipped his  head around and shouted, “What the hell are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her reply was short and succulent: With all of her might, she  positively screamed, “SIXTEEEEE…SIX!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This, and the ruckus that ensued, destroyed the group’s chances of  any sort of a peaceful ride. Tate Yuuichi, Shiho Minakata, Akane  Higurashi and her boyfriend Kazu, Natsuki Kuga, Aoi Senou, Chie  Harada, Reito Kanzaki, Mikoto Minagi, Midori Sugira, Shizuru Fujino,  and, of course, Mai Tokiha, dissolved into various states of laughter  and wakefulness, banter and serious discussion, violence and peace,  and for a while, all was as it was best. In Mai’s opinion, anyway.</span></p>

The  man in black followed the path of the conversion van with his sniper  rifle, and the tall grass by the side of the road didn’t make a  sound as he brushed it. Specifically, he followed the light brown  head of one of the girls in the back. His target.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A very odd target, though. She couldn’t have been more than  eighteen. The youngest person he’d ever killed in the past had been  twenty-five years old. It wasn’t that he was necessarily <em>opposed </em>to the idea; only that before the age of thirty or so, most  people didn’t need to die so badly that somebody was willing to pay  a price to have them killed by a professional.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Stranger yet, he supposed, was the fact that he hadn’t been paid to  kill her. He had been paid to watch her when she arrived, and notify  somebody of it. Nothing more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And he supposed that this was the time to do that. He supposed he was  nothing more than a checkpoint for now; he had been put on retainer  to his current employer, which meant that he was being paid a great  deal of money to do just about anything his employer asked him to do.  If that meant being a checkpoint, so be it. Maybe there were a  hundred more like him and he wouldn’t have to do any more work for  this paycheck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He leaned his head a little more to the right so that his ear touched  his shoulder, triggering the small comlink inside. “Target has  passed my location. Target is in the back seat, along with three  other females of roughly the same age.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was no reply for a moment, and then: “Confirmed. You can head  back for the day. We’ll be in touch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man in black let his sights track the van for a moment longer,  and then sighed, relaxed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of that, I have no doubt.”</span></p>
