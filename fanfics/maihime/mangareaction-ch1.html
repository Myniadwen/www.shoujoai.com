<h1>The Manga Reaction (part 1 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;I&#39;m chasing after Tate Yuuichi?!&quot; Natsuki Kuga
roared, the black haired young woman slamming her
script to the table of the crowded student council
room. &quot;You&#39;ve got to be joking,&quot;the furious young
woman growled.

The cast of the anime Mai Hime had gathered here
before they were going to go to work on the manga
incarnation of the series to read over the scripts and
try to get a feel for their revised roles. Of course,
those who were expecting things to be the same as the
anime version were in for quite a surprise.

&quot;We&#39;re all chasing Tate, more or less,&quot; Mai Tokhia
said wryly as the busty orange haired girl drank her
morning coffee, &quot;this is a harem manga, you know.&quot;

&quot;At least you like that pencil neck,&quot; Natsuki scowled
at Mai.

&quot;Don&#39;t talk about my big brother that way,&quot; Shiho
Manakata frowned, her red hair lashing about like
tentacles.

&quot;Considering you only appear in a rape flashback,&quot; Nao
Yuuki said as the redhead smiled coldly, &quot;do you even
survive into volume two?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Shiho&#39;s eyes went wide then she began to
frantically flip through her script to confirm it.

&quot;Damn it, why the hell couldn&#39;t they have just stuck
with the plot of the anime?&quot; Natsuki said with a
scowl.

&quot;I understand,&quot; Reito Kansaki said dryly from where
the black haired young man was gazing out of the
student council room window, &quot;this series was created
after the anime to be more popular with boys.&quot;

&quot;What could be more popular than lesbians?&quot; Masashi
Takeda asked, the kendoist leering at Natsuki
covertly.

&quot;Pervert,&quot; Nao muttered.

&quot;I&#39;m certainly glad to be in a more prudent role,&quot;
Haruka Suzuchiro declared, the blonde standing
dramatically for no reason whatsoever.

&quot;Prominent, Haruka-san,&quot; Yukino Kikukawa sighed, the
brown haired girl pushing her glasses up.

&quot;That&#39;s what I said,&quot; Haruka added quickly.

&quot;You sound cheerful, Haruka-san,&quot; Mai noted.

&quot;I&#39;m a Hime in this version,&quot; Haruka waved her script
around, &quot;and get to play a role fitting my statue!&quot;

&quot;Stature,&quot; Yukino corrected absentmindedly as she
read. She pointed to a page in the script, &quot;Did you
see who will be joining your squad?&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Yukino looked then her eyes widened in alarm.
&quot;I have to work with that delinquent Nao?!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to working with you too,&quot; Nao
took on a sexy pose, &quot;maybe we can resolve our...
differences?&quot;

&quot;I think I may be ill,&quot; Yukino made a face.

&quot;So where is the pencil neck, anyway?&quot; Natsuki asked,
referring to Tate.

&quot;He sent word he was going to be late,&quot; Akane
Higurashi sighed.

&quot;We&#39;re already having problems with our star?&quot; Yohko
Sagisawa smiled wryly, the gorgeous nurse reading over
her several page appearance.

&quot;He better not be,&quot; Mai muttered, clenching her fist.

&quot;So what do you think of the script, Mikoto?&quot; Yukino
asked mildly.

&quot;I like it,&quot; Mikoto Minagi nodded cheerfully.

&quot;I thought you&#39;d be more upset, considering Tate being
the lead,&quot; Mai looked over at Mikoto in surprise.

&quot;Take a look at this,&quot; Minagi pointed to a script
page.

Mai picked it up and read aloud as her eyes widened in
alarm. &quot;Mikoto grabbing me from behind... These are
mine?! You even reveal my bust size!&quot; she cried.

&quot;That&#39;s not the best part,&quot; Mikoto flipped ahead in
the script.

&quot;You and I in bed,&quot; Mai read a bit and went flaming
red.

&quot;Nice to see your relationship with Mikoto is
progressing so quickly, Mai,&quot; Shiziru Fujino said
mildly.

&quot;So what kind of relationship do you two have, Mai?&quot;
Aoi Senou ask from over where she and Chie were
reading their pages.

&quot;The kind that I&#39;m not going to discuss until Mikoto
gets past the jail bait age,&quot; Mai answered sheepishly.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Shiziru murmured as she gave Natsuki a side
look, smiling as the other girl blushed and looked
away.

&quot;You&#39;re taking your reduced role calmly,&quot; Haruka
gloated.

&quot;This simply means that I can spend more time off work
with my Natsuki,&quot; Shiziru said calmly, though her eyes
glittered dangerously.

&quot;I wonder if we should protest somehow?&quot; Akane asked
tentatively.

&quot;Better not,&quot; Natsuki scowled, &quot;they&#39;ll just bring
scabs in to play the leads like they did in Mai
Otome.&quot;

&quot;They wouldn&#39;t dare,&quot; Shiho protested, eyes wide with
alarm. She had been reduced to comedy relief in Otome,
she certainly didn&#39;t want it to happen again.

&quot;Wanna bet?&quot; Chie raised a eyebrow. Nor did she sound
too bothered, since her Otome part had actually been
more dramatic than her usual one. Not to mention that
Otome Chie was quite the player.

&quot;If I lose any more screen time to Arika and Nina
I&#39;ll...&quot; Nao scowled.

Reito looked over at Nao curiously and asked, &quot;Are the
rumors about you and Otome Natsuki true?&quot;

Nao was about to answer smartly when she felt
Shizuru&#39;s death glare on her. &quot;No comment,&quot; she
answered, playing it safe.

&quot;Wise move,&quot; Mai murmured. She scowled and burst out,
&quot;Where IS Tate?&quot;

&quot;Yo, the Tate-man is in the house!&quot; Yuuichi Tate
smiled as he breezed in, his usual school uniform
sparkling with added gold chain.

&quot;What the hell are you dressed like that for?&quot; Natsuki
asked, unconsciously speaking for most of the people
in the room.

&quot;With so many ladies chasing me I thought I should
dress the part,&quot; Yuuichi smiled as a fake diamond
glinted on his tooth, &quot;get some of that pimping bling
going.&quot;

There was a LONG quiet moment as everyone tried to
digest that. &quot;Mikoto,&quot; Mai broke the silence, &quot;can I
borrow your sword?&quot;

&quot;Sure Mai,&quot; Mikoto summoned the blade then passed it
over.

&quot;Now wait a minute...&quot; Yuuichi began to back away.

&quot;Come back here!&quot; Mai took a swing as he bolted and
ran.

&quot;Big brother!&quot; Shiho wailed.

&quot;Think we should save him?&quot; Chie asked as Yuuichi
clambered over a table then leapt out the window.

&quot;Nah,&quot; Aoi smiled, &quot;it&#39;s more entertaining this way.&quot;

&quot;Would you like to help Mai?&#39; Shizuru purred in
Natsuki&#39;s ear.

&quot;Tempting, but this won&#39;t change what we&#39;ll have to do
in the manga,&quot; Natsuki sighed.

Shizuru slid a hand around Natsuki&#39;s waist, &quot;Maybe,
but it&#39;ll make us feel better.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Natsuki grinned as she and Shizuri followed
the fleeing Tate outside. &quot;Duran,&quot; she cried,
summoning her Child, &quot;load chrome cartridge! Fire!&quot;

Boom!

&quot;Who know being a star could be this painful,&quot; Yuuichi
moaned, trailing smoke and covered in dirt from the
near miss.

&quot;Get back here!&quot; Mai took another swing at him with
the sword.

End

Notes: this is a silly fic inspired by the three Mai
Hime series (Hime, Otome and the Mangas) and the
characters reactions to their changed roles. As you
can guess I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the first volume of
the manga...</pre>
