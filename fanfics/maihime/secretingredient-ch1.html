<h1>The Secret Ingredient</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dezopengiun.html">DezoPenguin</a><br> </h2>
<P>Shizuru Fujino wanted to scream.</P><P>She didn't, of course. Shizuru Fujino did not 
screech like a banshee. She did not yowl like an alley cat whose tail had been stepped on. 
She did not erupt into a furious rage at people for things that, however inconvenient they 
might be for Shizuru, were not their fault. It would be undignified. Unladylike. Unsuitable 
for the former student council president of Fuuka Academy, now top-ranked scholar in her 
university class.</P><P>She looked down at the shattered remains of the pencil she'd 
snapped in three pieces upon hearing the news. Ara<I>, but that hardly counts; we're 
talking on the phone and he can't see it.</I></P><P>"Are you sure there is nothing you can 
do?"</P><P>"I'm sorry, Miss Fujino, but the new oven won't be installed until Thursday. 
We'll have your cake prepared immediately—"</P><P>"I am afraid that won't do; as you are 
aware, it is a birthday cake, and the birthday is tomorrow."</P><P>"I'm terribly sorry," 
the cake shop owner repeated. "We'll return your deposit at once, of course."</P><P>"Yes, 
thank you," Shizuru replied, a model of the reasonable customer. "I realize how hard this 
must be for your business as well."</P><P>"We appreciate your courtesy, Miss Fujino, and 
can only again offer our most abject apologies."</P><P>"Yes, thank you. Good 
afternoon."</P><P>She hung up the phone.</P><P>"<I>Ghaaaaa!</I>" she screamed, hurling the 
pencil bits against the wall. The shout woke up Kiyohime, who'd been napping at her feet; 
the hydra burst awake and ended up bonking her third head against the underside of the desk 
drawers. The sixth head reached up and gave Shizuru a curious hiss.</P><P>"It's the cake 
shop, Kiyo-chan. Their oven broke, and they won't be able to have Natsuki's birthday cake 
ready for the party!"</P><P>The first head made little mewling noises of commiseration, 
while the fourth head wrapped itself around Shizuru's ankle and hugged.</P><P>"What am I 
going to do now? This is Natsuki's nineteenth birthday! All of our friends are going to be 
there!"</P><P>Kiyohime's second head offered a curious hiss.</P><P>"Yes, that's it, I could 
make a—oh, whom am I kidding?" she wailed. "I can cook excellent Japanese food, but I'm 
hopeless at baking." She remembered her laughable attempts at baking a cake from the 
cooking class she'd taken as a high-school third-year. And then there was that absurd 
make-up session that Midori had arranged, which she'd <I>almost</I> managed to get through 
by letting Haruka volunteer to do everything for their group, except that Haruka was 
actually worse at it than Shizuru—even before her sachertorte had been knocked onto the 
ground. Though it hadn't been as bad as Natsuki's attempt; it had been such an effort to 
keep from laughing at Natsuki, Nao, and Mikoto's try to create anything edible. But then, 
even Mai's attempt had been sabotaged when Shiho faceplanted into the cake, so that day had 
been more or less cursed even for skilled cooks.</P><P>"Wait, that's it! Mai!" She looked 
at Kiyohime. "Mai is a wonderful baker! And she is Natsuki's close friend, so I'm sure she 
will be glad to help once she hears what happened!"</P><P>A couple of Kiyohime's heads 
bobbled up and down in nods of agreement (although in all fairness, the third might just 
have been woozy from the bump). Shizuru reached for the phone.</P><P>"Hello," a grumpy 
voice answered on the first ring.</P><P>"Mikoto? It's Shizuru Fujino—"</P><P>"Hi, 
<I>Kaichou-san!</I>"</P><P>Shizuru didn't bother correcting Mikoto on her use of her old 
title. "Could I talk to Mai, please?"</P><P>There was a long moment of 
silence.</P><P>"Mikoto?" Shizuru asked, a little worried.</P><P>"Mai's...not...here..." the 
response came in a mumbled undertone.</P><P>"What was that?"</P><P>"Mai's not here! She and 
<I>ani-ue</I> went off on a trip for the whole <I>weekend</I> and they won't be back until 
<I>tomorrow</I>! It's not fair! I wanted to play with Mai, too!"</P><P>"I'm not certain 
that you and Reito mean 'play with Mai' in the same way..." <I>Not if they're up to weekend 
trips...</I></P><P>"They're big meanies," Mikoto grumped. "I had to order in for dinner, 
and the restaurant's ramen isn't anywhere near as good as Mai's."</P><P>"You're right," 
Shizuru reflected. "Food made with love is the best." She remembered the time when they'd 
bought the backyard barbecue and Natsuki had insisted on grilling the 
steaks.</P><P><I>"You're always cooking for me, Shizuru, so this is my turn."</I></P><P>In 
the months since that first try, Natsuki had mastered the art, so that her grilled meat was 
juicy and delicious, but Shizuru thought she'd never taste anything as good as that first 
try when the steak had been charred to a briquette on the outside and near-raw in the 
center and somehow still wonderful because Natsuki had put herself through it all for 
her.</P><P>It took Shizuru a few more minutes to extract herself from Mikoto without 
offending the girl, and when she did, she realized that Kiyohime was gone.</P><p 
style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>"Damn, Kuga, your girlfriend may be a psycho, but 
she does throw one rocking party!" Nao crowed, clapping Natsuki enthusiastically on the 
back. The movement made the punch in the redhead's glass slosh, almost spilling; there was 
something a little too bright in her eyes, the color a little <I>too</I> high in her cheek, 
making Natsuki wonder just who'd spiked the punch bowl. <I>Probably Nao herself, or 
Midori</I>, she decided.</P><P>Nao was definitely right, though; the party was certainly in 
full swing. Music blared from the new entertainment center (Shizuru's present, which she'd 
insisted they'd get set up that morning so that Natsuki could "try it out right away"), and 
there was enough food set out to feed a small army. Which was good, because there was a 
small army of guests filling the house: all the HiME (save Fumi and Yukariko), Haruka, 
Takumi, Reito, Tate, Kazuya, Chie, Aoi, and about another dozen or so classmates of Natsuki 
or Shizuru or friends-of-friends.</P><P><I>When, exactly, did my life get this 
complicated?</I> she thought, then figured, <I>Oh, yeah, right about the time I stopped 
worrying about revenge and monster-fighting and international conspiracies.</I> Which had 
been easier in a lot of ways, if not nearly as conducive to restful night's sleep. She 
hardly ever had nightmares any more.</P><P><I>Yeah, all in all it was probably a good 
trade.</I></P><P>There was a loud squawk, and Yatagarusu launched itself from the 
refreshment table, a spring roll clutched in its single claw. Apparently someone else had 
had its eye on that prize, because Kagatsuchi launched himself after the crow and they 
buzzed around the room along with cries of "Hey!" "Watch it!" and (from Nao), "Damn flying 
rats!"</P><P>Natsuki shook her head, laughing. Exactly how had <I>this</I> somehow become 
her normal life?</P><P>She walked over to the food table and found an absolutely massive 
birthday cake, a double-decker sheathed in white frosting and decorated with colorful 
flowers. "Happy Birthday, Natsuki," was spelled out in blue frosting the color of Natsuki's 
Ducati across the top. But it was the flowers that caught her eye. Natsuki didn't know what 
they were; honestly, if it wasn't a rose or a dandelion she was lost. But she remembered 
the shape of those. She'd had her fingers curled around the petals of one, one day when she 
was in junior high. She'd been about to crush it—she didn't even remember why, now, some 
momentary fit of pique at some random event that had roused her temper at the time—when 
someone had called out to her.</P><P><I>Shizuru.</I></P><P>Funny, that Fuuka's top student, 
the elegant beauty admired by her classmates, speaking up to the save the life of one 
flower. Or maybe she'd seen something about Natsuki, something in Natsuki's posture, 
expression, whatever, and wanted to help out in her kind-sempai kind of way. Or she'd 
thought Natsuki was hot and figured it would be a chance to start a conversation. Natsuki 
had never really asked.</P><P>She'd wormed her way right into Natsuki's life, though. 
Sometimes by being kind and sympathetic, sometimes by being teasing and cajoling, she'd 
worked her way in, until by the time Natsuki had met Mai and Mikoto and Midori (and what 
<I>was</I> it with the letter M, anyway?) all the "lone wolf" jokes they'd tossed at her 
weren't true any more.</P><P>"Well, there's my answer," she said, a soft little smile 
forming on her face despite herself.</P><P>Duran was sitting in front of the table; he 
nuzzled against her leg and she stroked his head in response.</P><P>"Protecting the cake 
until I got here, huh, boy?"</P><P>He woofed happily, beating his tail on the 
rug.</P><P>"Thanks. So, can I get a piece, or do we have to do the whole candle-blowing-out 
thing?" She really hoped they didn't. Natsuki might have been a lot more comfortable in 
social situations than in her "ice princess" days, but she hated being the center of 
attention.</P><P>In response to her question, several of Kiyohime's heads popped up behind 
the table. One held a knife, with which it deftly sliced out a wedge from the cake. A 
second head used a metal spatula to remove the slice and transfer the cake to a plate held 
by yet another head, while a fourth gave her a plastic fork. The sides of the slice 
revealed themselves as rich, dark chocolate, and Natsuki dug in.</P><P>"Mmm, this is great! 
I wonder where Shizuru got it?"</P><P>"Actually, it's homemade."</P><P>Natsuki jumped. The 
purring voice with its lilting Kyoto accent had come from about two inches behind her right 
ear, close enough that her breath had tickled Natsuki's skin.</P><P>"Aah! Shizuru, don't 
<I>do</I> that!"</P><P>Her girlfriend giggled.</P><P>"But Natsuki is so very hard to 
resist!"</P><P>Natsuki gathered another forkful of cake. Luckily she hadn't dropped her 
plate.</P><P>"Try anyway. It'll build character." She transferred the forkful of cake into 
her mouth.</P><P>"But I thought Natsuki liked my weaknesses of character. Why just last 
night you were—"</P><P>Natsuki almost choked on her cake. Duran helpfully thumped her on 
her lower back with his paw, and she managed to swallow.</P><P>"Shi-Shizuru, don't say 
things like that in public!"</P><P>"<I>Ara</I>, but I don't think many of the guests here 
are under any illusions about our relationship."</P><P>"Okay, yeah, but you don't have to 
just start sharing the embarrassing details!"</P><P>Shizuru smiled wickedly.</P><P>"But I 
don't find them at all embarrassing. I'm more than happy for the world to know that Natsuki 
loves me so much that she wants me to—"</P><P>Ears burning, Natsuki clapped a hand over 
Shizuru's mouth.</P><P>"Argh! You can have the perverse sexual favor of your choice if you 
just <I>shut up!</I>"</P><P>"That's really not very much of a bribe, Natsuki. You give me 
the perverse sexual favors of my choice more or less nightly anyway."</P><P>Natsuki grinned 
back at her.</P><P>"Darn, I was trying to get out of this with two things I wanted instead 
of one."</P><P>"Natsuki, how manipulative and sneaky of you!"</P><P>"Hey, I learned from 
the best." She gave Shizuru a playful smack on the rump. "But what do you mean, this cake 
is homemade? You're a darned good cook, but baked goods hate you. Remember the blueberry 
muffin incident?"</P><P>"I thought we agreed never to speak of that."</P><P>"It's my 
birthday. I get special privileges. So spill."</P><P>"Well, I said it was homemade. I 
didn't say it was homemade by me."</P><P>Kiyohime ducked her heads under the table. When 
they popped back up, they were wearing puffy chef's hats.</P><P>"<I>You</I> made the 
cake?"</P><P>Duran woofed.</P><P>"You helped, too?"</P><P>He wagged his tail, a big doggy 
grin on his face.</P><P>"Wow. This is pretty awesome. I didn't even know you could 
bake."</P><P>"I'd ordered a cake, but the bakery couldn't deliver," Shizuru 
explained.</P><P>"That's okay. Besides, food made with love always tasted better. Like how 
I can only really put up with tea when you make it?"</P><P>Shizuru smiled.</P><P>"That's 
what I said to Mikoto. I think Kiyohime overheard it and it inspired her."</P><P>"Smart 
hydra."</P><P>They were interrupted by a startled yelp followed immediately by a 
high-pitched squeal rising from the far side of the room. Everybody turned to look where 
Shiho was standing, wide-eyed and open-mouthed, at the bathroom door.</P><P>"Akane! Kazuya! 
What are you two <I>doing</I>?"</P><P>"What doesh it <I>look</I> like?" Akane yowled back, 
voice slightly slurred.</P><P>"That's disgusting!"</P><P>"You're jusht mad you didn't think 
of it firsht."</P><P>"Midori, what did you put into the punch?" Mai accused.</P><P>"Midori? 
I thought <I>Nao</I> was the one who—" somebody else shot back.</P><P>"<I>Both</I> of 
them?" Natsuki boggled.</P><P>"I suppose that explains Akane's sudden...lack of 
inhibition?" Shizuru mused.</P><P>"I'm not touching the punch," Natsuki 
decided.</P><P>"Natsuki prefers to be inhibited?"</P><P>"Natsuki prefers to be able to 
remember it in the morning."</P><P>Shizuru laid her head on Natsuki's 
shoulder.</P><P>"You're such a romantic."</P><P>"Har de har." She took another bite of cake 
and savored the rich chocolate. "Seriously, they should have made this for your birthday, 
instead. I mean, why else call it 'devil's food'?"</P><P>"<I>Ikezu</I>. So what does 
Natsuki consider an appropriate birthday treat?"</P><P>"This."</P><P>She hooked an arm 
around Shizuru's waist and swung the elder girl around so they were face-to-face, then 
kissed her deep and forcefully on the lips, a hard, almost bruising kiss that claimed its 
recipient as the giver's own. Shizuru's crimson eyes were more than a little dazed and 
unfocused when Natsuki pulled back.</P><P>"I love you, Shizuru."</P><P>"I love you, too." 
Shizuru blinked, clearing the fog somewhat. "<I>Ara</I>, whose birthday is it, again? I 
seem to be the one getting all the presents."</P><P>"Idiot."</P><P><I>Lovable idiot, 
though, </I>Natsuki decided, and kissed her again.</P>
