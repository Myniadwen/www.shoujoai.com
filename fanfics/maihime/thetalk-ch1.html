<pre>Shizuru Fujino drew back with a smile as the brown haired woman settled 
on the bed, reaching out to caress her lover&#39;s arm. Natsuki Kuga lay 
sprawled on her back on the bed, her black hair messy and tangled from 
their recent exertions.

&quot;Those hands,&quot; Natsuki managed to get out breathlessly after a few 
moments, &quot;should be registered as deadly weapons.&quot;

&quot;Who, me?&quot; Shizuru smiled sweetly, clearly pleased by the thought.

&quot;Yes you,&quot; Natsuki laughed weakly, just glad that Shizuru found her own 
more basic skills satisfying. Catching her breath she slid off the bed 
and navigated her way to the kitchen, returning with juice for both of 
them.

Shizuru took the cup and said, &quot;Thank you, Natsuki.&quot;

Natsuki chuckled softly as she listened to that charming Kyoto accent 
and answered, &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; The sat there relaxing a moment on the 
twisted sheets, just enjoying each other&#39;s company as they drank, then 
Natsuki put her cup down. &quot;Shizuru...,&quot; she started, then trailed off 
nervously.

Shizuru looked over at her curiously, &quot;Yes?&quot;

Natsuki blushed, scratching at her cheek as she looked away. &quot;Shizuru, 
you don&#39;t get as good as you do without... uhm... experience...&quot; she 
trailed off uncomfortably.

Shizuru took a finger and ran it up Natsuki&#39;s bare arm teasingly as she 
asked, &quot;You wonder where I got that experience?&quot;

Natsuki looked even more embarrassed if that was possible as she 
muttered, &quot;Yes.&quot;

Shizuru sighed as she curled up to Natsuki&#39;s side as she thought about 
how best to put it, &quot;It&#39;s a bit of a long story.&quot; Her mind went back 
several years as she continued, &quot;Well, it happened like this...&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

For a long time Shizuru found herself with a certain awareness of her 
classmates that she knew was different than normal. She would find 
herself gazing at faces enraptured by their beauty, distracted by the 
perfect forms in clinging uniforms and beguiled by lilting voices. She 
didn&#39;t do anything about it, of course, but all through her highschool 
years she found herself drawn to the fairer sex.

Arriving at Fuka academy Shizuru settled into classes then began to 
explore Fuka town itself, soon finding a good tea shop. Soon afterwards 
Shizuru was walking through a certain part of town where she saw a 
unique shop, and a fateful meeting occurred with the lingerie shop&#39;s 
owner and main saleswoman.

Elliot Chandler was older than Shizuru, in her early thirties, and the 
attractive blonde had met Shizuru&#39;s eyes with a knowing gaze almost 
immediately. Her lips pulled back in a smile a bit too warm to be 
considered friendly as she walked over to greet her.

&quot;It&#39;s so nice to have a pretty customer,&quot; Elliot gushed as she took 
Shizuru&#39;s hands, &quot;my name is Elliot, Miss...?&quot;

&quot;Fujino,&quot; Shizuru answered as the woman squeezed her fingers, &quot;Shizuru 
Fujino.&quot;

Elliot lead her through the maze of lacy confections &quot;Fujino, it&#39;s all 
too often I see my product leaving the store on bodies unworthy of it. 
It&#39;ll be a pleasure dressing someone who&#39;s as lovely as you.&quot;

&quot;I was just planning to look,&quot; Shizuru protested, faintly surprised at 
how the woman seemed to be getting the upper hand. &#39;Maybe it&#39;s because 
she&#39;s older than I am,&#39; she thought, &#39;or because of her running the 
store?&#39;

Elliot shook her head, &quot;At least let me fit you with a new bra!&quot;

Shizuru found herself smiling at her exuberance, &quot;Well I suppose so.&quot;

&quot;Oh good,&quot; Elliot smiled as she swiftly let go of Shizuru&#39;s hand then 
swiftly got behind her. &quot;Hold still,&quot; she ordered sweetly them reached 
around to grab Shizuru&#39;s breasts!

&quot;Aah!&quot; Shizuru yelped as knowing hands cupped and felt each breast, 
touching them both professionally and in a knowing, sexual way.

&quot;Such nice breasts,&quot; Elliot mused as she gently traced the edges, 
avoiding the nipple and bringing another lusty cry from the girl, &quot;you 
must take good care of them.&quot; With stunning accuracy she swiftly 
determined Shizuru&#39;s exact bust size by touch, the fact she preferred 
front clasp bras and the sensitivity of her nipples.

Once released Shizuru sagged against the wall, her breath coming a bit 
faster. &quot;That was almost too much,&quot; she said shakily.

&quot;Oh, I think you could get used to it,&quot; Elliot winked as she looked 
through the racks, &quot;Do you have a favorite color?&quot;

&#39;Get used to it?&#39; Shizuru blinked as Elliot helped her pick out a few 
bras her size. &quot;I can change on my own,&quot; she noted as Elliot pulled the 
curtain back.

Elliot followed her into the changing room as she smiled warmly, &quot;But 
Shizuru, trying on a bra should be a enjoyable experience! Please, let 
me help.&quot;

&quot;But...,&quot; Shizuru started.

Elliot laid a finger against Shizuru&#39;s lips as she nearly purred in her 
ear, &quot;Please?&quot;

Shizuru shivered even as Elliot undid her blouse, tsking softly under 
her breath over her plain white bra. &quot;All right,&quot; Shizuru conceded, her 
body already longing to know that fiery touch once again.

Carefully Elliot hung up the blouse, her fingers trailing up Shizuru&#39;s 
arms, then she undid the bra, releasing her breasts. &quot;Oh dear,&quot; Elliot 
sighed, &quot;the wires in your bra left marks.&quot;

&quot;OH!&quot; Shizuru gasped as Elliot began to massage her breasts, carefully 
removing any trace of the last bra she had worn.

Elliot leaned close as she inspected each pink orb, her eyes twinkling 
wickedly, &quot;Hmm, I missed a spot.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Shizuru started breathlessly before Elliot clamped her lips around 
a rigid nipple. &quot;Ah!&quot; she twisted in pleasure against the back of the 
booth as Elliot flicked her tongue against her throbbing skin.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Elliot hummed as the vibrations traveled through the young 
woman&#39;s breasts, bringing her more pleasure. Releasing one nipple Elliot 
nibbled her way over to the other, massaging the other breast as she did 
so.

&#39;Oh I think I&#39;m going to cum,&quot; Shizuru thought, shocked at how well this 
woman could bring her pleasure purely from her breasts. &quot;Please, slow 
down...&quot; she gasped.

Elliot just chuckled wickedly as she licked and sucked, soon drawing 
forth orgasmic cries from the younger woman. She gently supported her as 
aftershocks rippled through her body, smiling down at her with a 
tenderness that seemed odd compared to her hunger a moment before. &quot;Are 
you all right?&quot; Elliot asked softly.

Shizuru pushed her sweaty hair back, her panties squishing wetly as she 
moved. &quot;I think I will be,&quot; she answered as she tried to catch her 
breath. Leaning against the wall, her breasts still tingling happily she 
looked at the older woman questioningly, &quot;Why...?&quot;

Elliot reached out to cup her breast tenderly as she asked Shizuru, &quot;Did 
you enjoy that?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Shizuru agreed, blushing.

&quot;So did I,&quot; Elliot smiled cheerfully, &quot;and to be honest you looked like 
you needed it.&quot; Changing the subject she held up one of the new bras, 
&quot;Now, would you like to try this on?&quot;

&quot;Yes, if you&#39;ll toss in a pair of underwear too,&quot; Shizuru said with as 
much dignity as she could manage.

Elliot nodded, &quot;Done!&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;The lingerie store owner?&quot; Natsuki blurted as Shizuru finished giving 
her a somewhat edited account of their time together.

&quot;Mmm hmm,&quot; Shizuru murmured as they cuddled together on the bed.

&quot;Wow...,&quot; Natsuki shook her head, &quot;I may never be able to look her in 
the eye again.&quot;

Shizuru chuckled softly, &quot;Why do you think I always tried to be in the 
store with you? I&#39;m not letting her have a shot at you.&quot;

&quot;You have me, I promise,&quot; Natsuki murmured softly. They lay there a 
moment then Natsuki mused, &quot;I suppose I should send Miss Chandler a 
gift.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Shizuru looked at her in confusion.

&quot;Well, I am reaping the benefits of her training you...,&quot; Natsuki 
winked.

&quot;Natsuki,&quot; Shizuru laughed, &quot;that would be a VERY bad idea, considering 
who we&#39;re dealing with.&quot; She paused, &quot;Besides, what would you get her?&quot;

&quot;Edible underwear?&quot; Natsuki guessed and Shizuru just laughed.

The End

Notes: Yes, that&#39;s Elliot Chandler from Mai Otome Sifr. I originally was 
going to either have Shizuru&#39;s older woman lover be a teacher at Fuka or 
a original character, but I figured why not use someone from one of the 
other series? Heh. The other character I considered was Ein from Otome 
Zwei, who trained that version of Shizuru and got rather... frisky when 
drunk.
