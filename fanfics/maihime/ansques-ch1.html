fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>If you have not yet seen the end of Mai-Hime this entire fic is a 
spoiler, so please stop reading now. Newtype vol 3 #7 and vol 5 #1 were 
both used for reference, though any mistakes that slipped through are my 
own.

----------

Nagi jerked as he heard the outer door slam open, then he heard a 
familiar and quite angry sounding voice yell out, &quot;Nagi!&quot;

&quot;Oh hell,&quot; the blue haired young man moaned, then moved to run away. But 
before Nagi could try to escape the chamber both young women burst 
inside, the black haired girl swiftly pinning him against the railing 
forcefully. &quot;Natsuki-chan, Mai-chan,&quot; Hagi smiled as endearingly as he 
possibly could at them, &quot;your not Hime any more, does that mean you 
can&#39;t hurt me?&quot;

&quot;I may not be Hime,&quot; Natsuki Kuga said as the black haired woman smiled 
down at him dangerously, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t beat you black 
and blue.&quot;

&quot;Or worse,&quot; Mai Tokiha added, her orange hair falling into her eyes as 
the busty young woman glared at him.

&quot;What can I do to help you?&quot; Nagi asked, giving in as gracefully as 
possible.

Very reluctantly Natsuki let him go, looking at him with a decidedly 
wary expression. &quot;When we Hime fought amoung ourselves,&quot; she said 
quietly, &quot;all of us... acted strangely.&quot;

&quot;Mikoto, Nao, Yukariko, and even me,&quot; Mai quietly agreed, &quot;it was hard 
to think straight and my emotions seemed to get the best of me too 
easily.&quot; She fixed him with a glare and demanded, &quot;Was that your doing?&quot;

&quot;Sounds more like PMS,&quot; Nagi quipped only to visibly wilt under both 
their glares. Quickly he said, &quot;It wasn&#39;t my doing!&quot;

&quot;So what was it?&quot; Natsuki glared.

&quot;The red star,&quot; Nagi admitted, &quot;it needed to drive you to war, to make 
you eliminate each other and your Childe until there was only one left.&quot;

&quot;So the things we did under it&#39;s influence...&quot; Mai murmured, thinking of 
some of the harsh things that were said and done, &quot;it wasn&#39;t us?&quot;

&quot;Not exactly,&quot; Nagi shook his head slightly, &quot;it exagerated your 
emotions, yes, but it all still came from within you.&quot;

&quot;And we should believe you?&quot; Natsuki asked him warily, still keeping a 
tight grip on thr front of his shirt, putting choking pressure on his 
throat.

&quot;Ask Mashiro if you don&#39;t believe me,&quot; Nagi said to them with as much 
calm as he could muster, &quot;she&#39;ll confirm every word.&quot;

&quot;I think he&#39;s telling the truth,&quot; Mai put a hand on Natsuki&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Maybe, but I still want to beat him black and blue,&quot; Natsuki muttered 
as she let him go, still standing near enough to pummel him if needed.

&quot;Besides,&quot; Mai added as she looked at Nagi thoughtfully, &quot;I think he&#39;s 
lost his powers, too. He&#39;s no threat to anyone, anymore.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m harmless,&quot; Nagi admitted reluctantly.

&quot;You&#39;ll never be harmless,&quot; Natsuki said grimly but she turned away, the 
two young women leaving much more quietly than they had come.

Nagi sighed, gingerly rubbing at his throat where she had nearly 
throttled him. &quot;Life was so much easier when I could send the Orphans 
out after them,&quot; he grumbled.

Mai and Natsuki quietly walked away from the building, the breeze gently 
stirring both their hair and their matching uniform skirts. &quot;So do you 
want to go see the director, Mashiro Kazahana?&quot; Mai asked her softly.

Natsuki shook her head, &quot;No, I think I believe him.&quot; With a smile she 
admitted, &quot;I guess I just wanted to scare the little creep a little.&quot;

&quot;I can sympathise with that,&quot; Mai agreed with a wry smile. She looked 
over at Natsuki as they paused beneath the trees and asked, &quot;Were you 
hoping that Shizuru&#39;s behavior was caused by that?&quot;

&quot;Partially,&quot; Natsuki said quietly, silently debating what she should 
tell Mai. They had been through a lot together, from starting out as 
near enemies to fighting together against Sears and finally the battles 
amoung themselves, and through all of it Mai had become a steadfast 
friend.

&quot;If you don&#39;t want to talk about it,&quot; Mai said compassionately, seeing 
the clear confusion on her friend&#39;s face.

&quot;I do,&quot; Natsuki smiled slightly. Taking a deep breath she said, &quot;I found 
out that Shizuru is in love with me.&quot;

&quot;Like how I&#39;m close to Mikoto?&quot; Mai said tentatively.

&quot;No,&quot; Natsuki said wryly, &quot;like how you&#39;re with Yuichi, I think.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Mai blinked in surprise.

&quot;I still haven&#39;t decided how I feel about it,&quot; Natsuki admitted.

Mai smiled at her faintly, &quot;Do you... feel the same way about her?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Natsuki said with a irritable shrug. She frowned a bit 
as she conceded, &quot;It&#39;s obvious I care for her, my ability to summon my 
Childe was based on that, but I don&#39;t know if I can return those 
feelings.&quot;

&quot;It can&#39;t have been easy for her to confess to you,&quot; Mai mused softly, 
thinking of how hard she found it to speak of such things with Yuichi.

&quot;No, it wasn&#39;t,&quot; Natsuki agreed, remembering how Haruka had confronted 
them with Shizuru&#39;s feelings, nearly gloating over discovering the 
president&#39;s secret. &#39;Of course that blew up in her face,&#39; Natsuki 
recalled.

Mai noted the time and frowned, &quot;I&#39;d better get back, I bet Mikoto is 
fainting from hunger by now.&quot; As Natsuki chuckled at that comment Mai 
continued, &quot;I think you should at least talk to Shizuru about it, you 
owe her that.&quot;

&quot;Maybe so,&quot; Natsuki frowned as Mai raced off. The black haired young 
woman made her way through Fuka Academy, striding across campus with 
determination, standing apart from the other students as usual.

The buildings around them bore the scars of battle, walls having fallen, 
windows broken and streets damaged, all because of the battles between 
Hime and the aftermath, the war againced the power that created them. 
But the campus was renewing itself, students returning even as repair 
crews bustled to make everything right again.

Without really intending to Natsuki found herself in the gardens, the 
sweet scent of flowers waftig around her as she paused, reaching out to 
caress a golden flower. &#39;I met Shizuru here the first time,&#39; she 
remembered, smiling fondly.

&quot;Natsuki?&quot; that familiar voice asked.

She turned and Natsuki could feel herself smile, even without intending 
to. Shizuru smiled back, the tall brown haired woman&#39;s eyes warm with 
caring and just a bit of amusement. &quot;I was going to come by the student 
council room later,&quot; Natsuki said quietly.

Shizuru walked over to where Natsuki stood, both women quickly enveloped 
by the sweet scent of the flowers. &quot;Good,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;I was 
hoping you would.&quot; She looked around them, clearly also touched by 
common memories as she murmured, &quot;You aren&#39;t going to try to crush the 
flowers again, are you?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m over that,&quot; Natsuki gently reassured her. &#39;Thanks to you,&#39; she 
realized, gazing at Shizuru thoughtfully. She had come to Fuka filled 
with anger, driven by the thought of vengeance for her mother, and 
hadn&#39;t cared about anything else. Shizuru had come across her and for 
whatever reason kept reaching out, staying in Natsuki&#39;s life and slowly 
chipping away at her angry shell.

&quot;Natsuki?&quot; Shizuru asked softly, bringing Natsuki&#39;s eyes to her face. 
&quot;When you were at my home, whatever Haruka may have thought she saw,&quot; 
her eyes glittered with anger for a moment, &quot;I just lay with you then, 
nothing more.&quot;

Without thinking about it Natsuki reached out, gently taking Shizuru&#39;s 
hand and squeezing it in her own. &quot;I know,&quot; she said softly, smiling at 
her warmly. &quot; Shizuru...?&quot; she hesitated.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Shizuru asked, reaching up to hold Natsuki&#39;s hand in both of 
hers.

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I can love you,&quot; Natsuki said then admitted, &quot;I&#39;m not 
even sure I understand the meaning of the word. But I&#39;d like to try, if 
you&#39;d let me.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all that I ever wanted,&quot; Shizuru said softly, tears glittering 
in her eyes.

Shizuru leaned towards Natsuki a bit then stopped, giving her a chance 
to back away. Instead Natsuki moved to meet her, their lips touchig in a 
gentle kiss. Without intending to her hands slid around Shizuru, holding 
her close as the kiss deepened and lasted.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Natsuki finally murmured as they seperated, &quot;I got carried 
away.&quot;

&quot;You can carry me away anytime,&quot; Shizuru murmured, then smiled as 
Natsuki blushed.

End.

Notes: This fanfiction is set just after the final battle in the final 
episode of Mai Hime but before the last wrap up scenes where we found 
out what happened to each character. It&#39;s an attempt to resolve a few 
issues I had with Mai Hime, including why nobody grilled and/or beat up 
Nagi over his role, as well as why everyone acted so strange in the 
final storyline. The &quot;red star&quot; theory is mine, not something from the 
anime...</pre>
