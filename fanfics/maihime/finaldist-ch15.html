<p>Annam...Shizuru was in Annam.</p>
<p>Or  at least that’s what Headmistress Oleander-sama had informed her as she  ushered Natsuki into the Academy’s private limousine that would take  her to Windbloom Station.</p>
<p><em>‘Don’t worry, we’ll take care of everything’ </em>the  woman had said, and the raven-haired soldier could only take the  Column’s word for it as the door closed and the driver sped off.</p>
<p>After  arriving at the station and retrieving her free ticket, which had  apparently just been called in from the school moments before her  arrival, Natsuki boarded the silver transit and was escorted to the  private coach that was reserved for Garderobe Academy, and the  individuals the school gave permission to, only.</p>
<p>Once she was  alone, Natsuki allowed herself to ungracefully plop down onto the  bench-style seat, drawing her legs up as she lied down on its maroon  cushioning.</p>
<p>She was tired. Exhausted really. She had already  endured an eight-hour plane ride from Vedel, and now it would be  followed up with an even longer train ride to Annam. She wouldn’t  arrive until tomorrow, so at least she could try to get some rest,  Natsuki thought to herself as she released an unrestrained yawn.  Sitting up, she carefully slipped her currently mechanized arm from its  sling, carelessly tossing the thing on the opposite seat, before  glaring down at the metal hand in her lap.</p>
<p>Simply put, she  despised the piece of equipment, but as long as her arm was still in  pieces, it was absolutely necessary for proper healing. Even so, the  uneasiness that it caused her mind made her want to assure that there  was still human flesh underneath, and so without hesitation, Natsuki  unlocked the hand section of the gauntlet and removed the piece to see  the pale skin that it hid.</p>
<p>What she saw both helped and didn’t  help her cause. Sure, her hand was still there, very much attached and  working, but at the same time her emerald eyes had to gaze upon the  metal pins, and the deep bruising around them, that were inserted into  that same hand holding the fixation rod, which kept her arm straight,  in place. The damn thing made her wrist completely stationary and only  allowed minimal, not to mention painful, movement of her fingers.</p>
<p>“<em>What will Shizuru will think of this, I wonder...” she bleakly pondered. </em></p>
<p>Irksome  frown sagging even more, Natsuki resentfully slipped her hand back into  the metallic glove with a huff, the device making a small <em>‘click’ </em>as  she locked it into place, and reclining once again, the girl allowed  her eyelids to drift shut as the constant clatter of the train wheels  lulled her to sleep.</p>

To  Natsuki, Annam was a new and unexplored country. It was a large  providence to the far east of Windbloom that she had never had the  chance to visit before, but she had heard stories about the place from  Shizuru who had heard them from her Onee-sama, Anh Lu. The dark-haired  girl had never met Anh, but Natsuki had seen her picture, once again  thanks to Shizuru, so her keen jade eyes caught on to the vaguely  familiar face of the woman amongst the crowd of strangers as soon as  she had stepped off the train.
<p>“You are…Natsuki Kruger, yes?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“So you’re the one…” the gray-eyed woman mumbled almost inaudibly to herself.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry?”</p>
<p>“Never mind me. Welcome to Annam, Natsuki-san, I’m Anh Lu, Meister Otome to King Nguyen Bao.”</p>
<p>“It’s nice to finally meet you, Anh Onee-sama. Shizuru has told me a lot about you.”</p>
<p>“Likewise.”</p>
<p>At the girl’s mystified expression, the older woman chuckled, “Do you have any luggage?”</p>
<p>“No, ma’am…This trip is sort of last minute.”</p>
<p>“Indeed it is.”</p>
<p>The soldier bowed, “I apologize for any inconveniences.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense,”  Anh implored, “the Headmistress informed me of the situation, and I was  more than willing to help, especially if it will make Shizuru-san  happy.”</p>
<p>“I-Is she here?” Natsuki questioned, her words laced with more anticipation than she intended.</p>
<p>The  woman shook her head, short golden-brown locks swaying from the  movement, “No, she’s back at the palace. We haven’t informed her of  your arrival yet…I thought I would give you the chance to surprise her.”</p>
<p>“R-Right...”</p>
<p>“Well then, shall we be on our way?”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
It  was on the car ride back to King Nguyen’s residence that Natsuki became  aware of just where Shizuru had learned all of her sneaky flirty ways.
<p>From the stories that Anh told her, it seemed that this woman had  been able to do the near impossible while still attending Garerobe…<em>She</em> had been able to make <em>Shizuru</em> blush. Or at least she was able to at first until the chestnut-haired  beauty had deftly learned to fight fire with fire, and inevitably  become immune to even Anh’s strongest attempts.</p>
<p>Natsuki was both  amused and perturbed with the Meister. Shizuru’s teasing had been the  dark-haired girl’s downfall on more than one occasion, but at times,  although she would never admit it, she secretly enjoyed the attention  that her Onee-sama gave to her. But then again, Natsuki wasn’t the only  one that Shizuru played with. There were countless other girls whom the  young Column had preyed upon over the years, and the number only  continued to increase with time.</p>
<p>To sum it up, Shizuru flirted  and teased with whomever she pleased, but despite her groping,  wandering hands, and close calls, the woman had never dedicated herself  fully to one person. Well, that was as far as Anh knew anyway.</p>
<p>Since she had been away though, she <em>strongly</em> emphasized, things might have changed.</p>
<p>When they reached the mansion, Anh was the first to enter the estate to <em>“make sure the coast was clear” </em>to which Natsuki just rolled her eyes and played along.</p>
<p>The  Annam Palace was roughly about half the size of Windbloom Castle, and  although it didn’t necessarily look old, it certainly felt that way,  like generation after generation had taken shelter in this same  structure. At least they seemed like a modest people these Annamians,  the girl thought to herself, an admirable trait in her book for sure,  especially when it came to nobility.</p>
<p>As Natsuki was taking in her  surrounds, she noticed a maid approach Anh out of the corner of her  eye. There was a small exchange of words before the woman bowed  politely and took her leave, and once she had gone, the Otome walked  over to the emerald-eyed girl’s side.</p>
<p>“She’s in the garden. Would you like me to show you the way?”</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>Walking through those few hallways, Natsuki’s pulse began to quicken, her heart beating faster and faster.</p>
<p>“<em>What am I so nervous about? It’s not like I’ve never seen or talked to her before…”</em> she questioned, wiping her sweaty palm on the side of her pants as they kept moving.</p>
<p>Eventually  the two came to the final door, and Anh opened it for the girl and gave  her a reassuring smile, “I’m sure you can manage from here,  Natsuki-san.”</p>
<p>“Mmh. Thank you, Anh Onee-sama.”</p>
<p>Stepping out  into the ever-darkening dusky atmosphere, Natsuki quietly proceeded  along the cobbled pathway, taking in the sights of the exotic flowers  and shrubbery as she walked.</p>
<p>And then she heard it. A soft  humming coming from the direction of the pond that Natsuki could only  partially see at the moment. She caught her breath, holding it in as  she let the sweet melody soothe her anxiety. She crept closer, and when  she finally got to the end of the tall hedges, peeked around the edge.</p>
<p>There she was, just mere yards away, casually leaning over a group of vividly lilac hibiscus flowers.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Purple has always been her favorite color,&quot;</em> Natsuki thought to herself with a smile before she stealthily slipped  out of her sling and cautiously laid it down on the ground.</p>
<p>If  there was one thing that Natsuki was secretly proud of, it was the fact  that she was amongst the very few who could actually sneak up on the  crimson-eyed woman from time to time. Whether this was because Shizuru  merely let her or not, Natsuki wasn’t entirely sure, but this was  certainly an ample time to test that theory.</p>
<p>Swiftly and  soundlessly she positioned herself behind the woman, and as soon as  Shizuru began to stand, the raven-haired girl took action.</p>
<p>Lacing  her arms around her waist, Natsuki eased Shizuru back against her body,  placing her chin on her shoulder as she whispered into her ear.</p>
<p>“I was hoping for a chance…to have you to myself…”</p>
<p>The  body that had tensed at the initial touch immediately slackened at the  sound of the rough voice, and Natsuki could feel it begin to tremble in  her arms.</p>
<p>“Nat…suki…”</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>“Are you…real? This…This isn’t a dream, is it? Tell me it isn’t another dream.”</p>
<p>“I’m here, Shizuru,” the younger girl assured before loosening her grip to turn her friend around.</p>
<p>Tear-filled russet orbs stared into sturdy jade ones for mere moments before the two embraced again, clinging tightly.</p>
