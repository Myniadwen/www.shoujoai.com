<p>A Prayer</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I  had received the message on my phone from Mai this morning telling me  to meet at the gazebo in the gardens before school for a “HiME  talk.” <em>HiME talk?</em> Seriously? That made it sound like we were in a secret club or  something, but figuring that this had to deal with what had happened  the other night, I reluctantly headed in that direction after I had  arrived on the school grounds.
<p>Trudging over, I could  hear murmured voices as I approached, and once I got close enough, I  could make out that it was Mai filling Midori in on what had taken  place between us and Miyu and Alyssa. With a yawn, I slipped in  beside the nearest column, pressing my weight against the cool white  stone.</p>
<p>“Natsuki, I’m glad  you’re here. I was afraid you wouldn’t come,” the redhead  addressed me.</p>
<p>I sighed, “Why  wouldn’t I? You did message me after all…What happened last night  is important to me too.”</p>
<p>“So, how exactly did  you get dragged into this, Kuga-san? Mai said you were the one who  got captured…” Midori questioned.</p>
<p>My  eye twitched involuntarily at the memory, “I had my suspicions of  Father Greer being involved with this <em>Searrs  Foundation</em>. When I went to  investigate, something certainly was going on in the church basement,  but before I could find out anything I blacked out. When I woke up, I  was at that old factory. I assume Mai told you the rest.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you  give me a call?” the teacher whined at the busty girl, sorry to  have missed out on the action.</p>
<p>“Sure I did, many  times,” Mai chastised, “I was counting on you, but you don’t  pick up your cell phone at all. It was really tough, you know.”</p>
<p>“But, Miyu-san’s  the enemy…” the older woman solemnly stated.</p>
<p>Mikoto nodded, “She’s  strong. What is she?”</p>
<p>“Android, robot,  cyborg…” I mumbled, “Whatever it may be, she’s no ordinary  human.”</p>
<p>“Androroimo?”</p>
<p>“This sounds like a  bad joke,” Mai said, her expression one of concern.</p>
<p>“A girl who  manipulates the Orphans…An android…A dark group that’s after  HiMEs…Mmh it’s getting exciting!” Midori suddenly exclaimed,  “Feels like the big bosses are showing up, doesn’t it?!”</p>
<p><em>How old is she?  Five?</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, for  sanity’s sake, Mai was still on track, “But both Miyu-san and  Alyssa-chan are gone now…”</p>
<p>“It seems the Searrs  Foundation has been researching the power of HiMEs,” I informed the  group before pushing off of my column, “I can’t think of them  giving up so easily. I suggest you stay on your toes.”</p>
<p>No sooner had I  finished my warning, my phone began to ring, and digging the device  out of my jacket pocket, I checked the display to see that it was  Yamada.</p>
<p>“Homeroom’s staring  soon,” Midori called after me, “Don’t ditch classes at the  start of a new semester.”</p>
<p>“<em>You’re the last  person I want to hear that from,”</em> I thought myself as I  silently walked off so I could call Yamada back, and once I had  cleared the garden, taking refuge in the grassy center of the empty  track field, I did just that. It didn’t take him long to pick up.</p>
<p>“It’s me.”</p>
<p>“<em>Kuga. That was  fast…Anyway, you know how you told me to keep looking into those  two companies?”</em></p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“<em>Well, I still  haven’t been able to find too much on that Searrs Foundation, but I  did manage to hack into the records of the other.”</em></p>
<p>“Iwasaka  Pharmaceutical?”</p>
<p>“<em>Mmh. Seems they  have a directory specifically for that Fuuka School of yours, and  inside that directory was a file for a girl named Higurashi Akane.”</em></p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“<em>I guess that name  rings a bell, huh?“</em></p>
<p>“Were there any other  names?”</p>
<p>“<em>Not that I could  tell.”</em></p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“<em>Well, I can’t  really talk now, but I thought you’d want to know.”</em></p>
<p>“Wait! I have more—“</p>
<p>“<em>Save them for  now, Kuga. We can talk more tonight, right now I have more work to  do.”</em></p>
<p>“But—!“</p>
<p>“<em>You’re not the  only one I work for, you know.”</em></p>
<p>Before I could argue,  the sound of dial tone buzzed in my ear, and pulling the phone away  from my head, I growled at the device.</p>
<p><em>This is important,  dammit! More important than whatever else it is you’re looking  into! I thought the rumor was that Akane and that Kazuya guy ran off  together, but now...</em></p>
<p>The sound of the  morning bell radiated across the campus, and all I could do was bury  my face in my free hand, messaging my temples with my thumb and  middle finger. School was the last thing I want to think about right  now with so many questions clogging my brain, but, as much as I hated  to admit it, Midori did have a point about not missing the beginning  of the semester. It wasn’t smart to get behind right from the  start, so, reluctantly, I began the trek back towards the high school  building.</p>
<p>I had just about made  it back to the school when I heard a familiar voice call out from  behind me, and instinctively I turned to the source.</p>
<p>“Natsuki’s running  late…It seems that I’m going to have to issue her a detention.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it a little  hypocritical of the Kaichou to give out tardies when she’s running  late herself?” I smartly countered.</p>
<p>“Ah, but <em>I</em> wasn’t running late.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? It  certainly looks like she is.”</p>
<p>“Actually, <em>I</em> was just in a meeting with the Director, so <em>I</em> am excused,”  Shizuru informed me, one of her delicate fingers flicking the end of  my nose, “Too bad I can’t say the same for Natsuki.”</p>
<p>I quickly rubbed the  spot of contact as my cheeks colored lightly, “Psh, whatever. But  now you’re only making me more late than I already am.”</p>
<p>The older girl chuckled  as we walked into the building, “Ara, I can tell your teacher that  you were assisting me if you wish.”</p>
<p>“Nah, don’t worry  about it. It’s not like being late is anything new to me.”</p>
<p>“Natsuki needs to  work on that,” Shizuru chided me to which I rolled my eyes.</p>
<p>“Anyway,” she  continued, “how about we meet for lunch? I had some extras this  morning and went ahead and packed them.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh, uh, sure.  The usual place, I’m guessing?”</p>
<p>“Yep. I’ll see you then,” the girl replied with a wave as she  walked off down the hallway as I continued up the stairwell to my  floor.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Is it no good?”
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“The food…you’ve  hardly touched it at all,” I remarked, setting my bento down in my  lap to give my full attention to the raven-haired girl beside me.</p>
<p>“N-No, that’s not  it at all,” Natsuki stuttered as she continued to poke at the  contents in her box, “I guess I’m just—“</p>
<p>“Preoccupied?”</p>
<p>At the girl’s further  distraught expression, which pained me to no end, I swiftly averted  the topic with my quick thinking.</p>
<p>“Ara, I know there  isn’t <em>nearly</em> as much mayo as Natsuki prefers, but the little  packets from the cafeteria were the best I could manage on such short  notice. They were already giving me strange enough looks as it was, I  feared grabbing any more.”</p>
<p>That won me a smile,  and I reveled in its simple beauty.</p>
<p>“Oh, shut up,” the  mayo-addict playfully reprimanded me before shoving a piece of dried  fish into her mouth, “Mgh, hwey—“</p>
<p>“Natsuki really  shouldn’t speak with her mouth full,” I scolded before taking a  delicate bite of my own fish.</p>
<p>Once Natsuki had  hastily chewed and swallowed, she continued, “There’s another  festival coming up, right?”</p>
<p>“The Tamayura  Festival, yes, and<em> ‘coming up’ </em>meaning tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“That soon, huh?”</p>
<p>“Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“I just heard some  girl’s talking earlier is all. I guess that mean’s you’ve been  pretty busy again?”</p>
<p>“Not as much as  during the Anniversary Celebration. We get a lot of the same vendors  to come to both, plus a lot of the planning was taken care of during  the summer break.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“Does this mean that  Natsuki is interested in coming? Maybe this time we’d actually be  able to look around together.”</p>
<p>“It’s at night,  isn’t it?” the girl questioned.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Sighing, Natsuki  scratched the back of her head, “Eh…Nights really aren’t good  for me…Sorry.”</p>
<p>I was quick to mask my  disappointment with an airy smile, “Don’t worry, I know that  you’re busy with things, so don’t apologize for something you  can’t control.”</p>
<p><em>As for what ‘things’  are…</em></p>
<p>“Hey, but, if nothing  does come up, I’ll be sure to call you, alright?”</p>
<p>“Then I shall eagerly await Natsuki’s call,” I replied,  allowing my smile to broaden though I knew in my heart that it would  probably never come.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Later that night, I met  Yamada at the Rorschach like usual, but it  wasn’t long before we left and I followed him out of the city to a  hilltop overlooking the secluded facility of the Iwasaka  Pharmaceutical Company. Once I had cut the engine of my Ducati and  promptly removed my helmet, I joined Yamada at the back of his van.
<p>“You know, with the  money I’m paying you, you should really consider getting a slicker  set of wheels.”</p>
<p>“Hey, this van is the  best way for me to cart around my equipment,” my informant  protested from inside the vehicle, digging through a box of tools in  the process.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but brown? You  should at least get a better paint job…” I commented, picking at  the pealing paint on the door with my fingernail.</p>
<p>“It’s less  conspicuous this way. No one would bother an old dirt-colored thing  like this.”</p>
<p>“You can say that  again …”</p>
<p>“Look, are we here to  check this place out, or not?” the man retorted, shoving a pair of  high-tech binoculars at me.</p>
<p>I swiftly snatched the  things, “Yeah, yeah.”</p>
<p>Walking away from the  vehicles, I peered through the binoculars, their night vision  capabilities deftly allowing me to scope the facility. There was one  giant building accompanied by four others that were considerably  smaller in size, all of which were on the same concrete structure  built up higher than the main road, making me wonder if there could  more basement levels below.</p>
<p>“So Higurashi is  somewhere in there?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I can’t be  certain, but that’s what I’m guessing.”</p>
<p>“You couldn’t peek  inside the file?”</p>
<p>“All I was able to  hack were the file directories…But, under the Fuka Gakuen  directory, Higurashi Akane’s file did exist,” Yamada informed me.</p>
<p>“Why…her?”</p>
<p>“So? What’s the  plan?”</p>
<p>Plan? I didn’t have a  plan…All I knew was that I needed to get that girl out of there as  fast as possible, not only for her sake, but also possibly for the  sake of finding more answers.</p>
<p>“What else? We go in.  Think you can find me a way inside?” I questioned, turning back to  the man behind me.</p>
<p>Yamada just smirked,  “Already covered. They have a shipment of narcotics being delivered  by truck tomorrow evening, estimated time of arrival around eight.”</p>
<p>“Mmh. Right, then  let’s meet back up tomorrow at six to go over the procedure. In the  meantime, find out as much about that facility as you can. Floor  plan, security, everything,” I ordered, handing the binoculars back  over before heading towards my bike.</p>
<p>“Got it,” came Yamada’s simple reply, and not too long after, I  was speeding back down the road towards home.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I had bought the ribbon  days ago, but it wasn’t until now that I was actually sitting down  with a marker hovering over the thin lavender strip, hesitating to  write the first symbol of that precious name that I found more  beautiful than any other sound.
<p>The Tamayura Festival  is popular around the Fuuka Academy campus mainly because of the  legend that surrounds the Crystal Arena. It is believed that if you  tie a ribbon with the name of the person you love onto the center  circular railing of the building that you and that person will be  with each other forever, the ribbon acting like a tie that binds your  two souls for eternity. Now, usually I am not one to believe in  folklore such as this, but I am a bit of a <em>“hopeless romantic”</em>as Natsuki once put it, so of course I wasn’t about to pass up  this open opportunity, even if it was just the symbolism of the  action that mattered.</p>
<p>I honestly did want to  be with Natsuki for eternity…to watch over and protect her…Simply  to be with her…that would make me happier than anything else in  this world, and so I pressed the tip of the black marker down on the  ribbon, taking my time as I delicately spelled out her name, the  syllables rolling off my tongue as I wrote.</p>
<p>“<em>Na – tsu –  ki</em>.”</p>
<p>Once I had finished, I  took a moment to allow my fingers to gingerly sweep across the ribbon  before tucking it into my yukata, a gentle pink fabric with a  hibiscus print, right next to my heart.</p>
<p>After gathering some  personal belongings and tossing them into a small bag that nicely  matched my violet obi, I exited my dorm and made my way down to the  school.</p>
<p>By the time I arrived  there was already a bustling crowd, and I couldn’t help but take  some pride in the work I had done in helping organize the events that  so many people seemed to be enjoying. Trying to keep a low profile, I  quietly examined the various venders and booths set up, nothing  particularly catching my eye.</p>
<p>Passing by the Crystal  Arena, I lingered around until the place looked relatively crowded  before slipping in, hoping that the masses would help hide my  presence. To my luck, my little plan worked, and I managed to find a  relatively clear spot almost directly across from where I had  entered. As I walked around, I glanced at some of the ribbons already  tied, taking note that my name was written on a few, but paying more  attention to the ones that had Natsuki’s name on them and feeling a  little twinge of resentment towards those unknown individuals who  dared to write down her name so lightly.</p>
<p>Finally making it to  the spot, I gracefully kneeled down, retrieving my ribbon and giving  it a light kiss before proceeding to carefully tie the item onto the  cool metal handrail. Straightening and taking a step back, I brought  my hands together and closed my eyes.</p>
<p><em>Although I do not know to whom, I ask that you please guide  Natsuki’s feet on the safest path when I cannot protect  her…Always…always bring her back to me…Help me to open her  heart and never leave her side so that we may be together for the  rest of this life and for all of those that follow. This…is my  prayer.</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Target is on the  fourth floor below ground. It’s probably there.”
<p>I heard Yamada’s  voice, but I was far too preoccupied with the truck that was soon to  pass under the bridge we were currently standing on to give him any  verbal recognition that I had, only nodding my head as I kept my eyes  fixed on the vehicle speeding towards us. We were relatively close to  the spot we had driven to the previous night. Just about a mile down  the road, there was an underpass where a section of the hillside had  been blown out to make room for another road, and it was here that we  laid in wait for the delivery truck that Yamada had learned of during  his research.</p>
<p>I crouched down when I  saw it rise over the last hill, and right before the trailer could  enter the shelter of the stone structure, I jumped, the momentum of  the truck immediately knocking me off my feet, leaving me to scramble  to grip on to any part of the edge I could get my hands on. Once I  had secured myself, it was just a matter of holding on until we  stopped inside the facility…and, in the meantime, steering clear of  any bugs that felt like flying into my face.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long  for us to enter the Iwasaka Pharmaceutical premise, and once I saw  that we were headed towards one of the smaller buildings, I  immediately bailed from my spot atop the truck, rolling once I hit  the ground to brace myself from the fall, and quickly slipping into  the shadows to avoid any security guards or cameras that might be  about.</p>
<p><em>Yamada said Akane  was being held in the main building…</em></p>
<p>Although the building  was right in front of me, I opted to go the long way around just to  be careful, and after a few minutes of running, I had circled the  entire area and made it to the back of the giant research facility. I  located an emergency exit, which was locked of course, and  immediately called forth my element, freezing the handle in a single  shot and shattering it moments later.</p>
<p>To my luck, the door I  had entered was connected to a stairwell, which made my decent to  base level four that much easier. Once I had arrived on the correct  floor, I grabbed the handle, but before pushing the door open, I shut  out all of my other senses, focusing only on my hearing as I placed  my ear against the slick metal surface.</p>
<p><em>Nothing…Seems like  it’s clear for now…</em></p>
<p>Still keeping myself on  high alert, I quietly entered the hallway.</p>
<p>Everything was  strikingly white, and so bright that it nearly burned my eyes after  being outside in the dark for so long. The smell reminded me of a  hospital, sterile cleaning chemicals assaulting my nostrils, and I  shivered at the sensation that brought back the horrible memories of  my own extended stay in the hospital after the accident with my  mother.</p>
<p>Pushing the thought  aside, I began my trek through the endless wonderland of repeating  hallways, not perfectly clear on where it was I was supposed to be  heading, that is until I vaguely heard a voice echoing down the  corridor, drawing my attention and leading me onward. As I got  closer, the once mumbling started to become real words as I followed  the eerie voice.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it nice? I  dressed up for Kazu-kun.”</p>
<p><em>Akane? Is Kazuya  with her? Which door is it…</em></p>
<p>“I really love  Kazu-kun.”</p>
<p><em>That’s the one.</em></p>
<p>“Don’t be silent.  Kazu-kun, answer me. I said answer me.”</p>
<p><em>Huh? What’s going  on…?</em></p>
<p>“Won’t you,  Kazu-kun? Kazu-kun? Kazu-kun!”</p>
<p>As soon as I peered  through the small opening in the door, the girl inside released a  horrific scream, and I very much wanted to do the same, not being  prepared for what I was witnessing.</p>
<p>Higurashi Akane, the  quiet, shy girl from my class, was strapped into a white chair much  like one you’d sit in while at the dentist, her eyes wide as she  writhed against the restraints that firmly held in her place,  although she seemed to be in some kind of dream state. As hard as it  was to watch, the worst part to see were all the wires and cables  running from various equipment in the room to her body. Some were  merely attached to her skin while others were clearly shoved under  her flesh, reminding me far too much of my own terrible experience.</p>
<p>When I finally  collected my wits, I quickly summoned my element once again and made  quick work of the door. Once through, I ran to the girl’s side,  trying to shake her into arousal to no avail as she continued her  screaming that sent chills up and down my spine. Trying to block it  out, I glanced around the room, my eyes lingering on one of the  computer monitors. Going to the thing to get a closer look, the  display revealed to me that it was on some sort of cycle, delivering  meds to the girl every twenty minutes.</p>
<p><em>Is this what’s  causing it?!</em></p>
<p>Without a second  thought, I blasted the thing, and turning back to Akane, I began  removing the wires from her body, which proved to be difficult as she  continued to twist and turn in the chair. I had to clamp down on my  lower lip to try to keep my emotions at bay, but after several  minutes, she finally calmed down and seemed to drift off to sleep,  much to my relief.</p>
<p>After I had completed  my work and unbuckled all of the restraints, I positioned the  unconscious girl so I could carry her piggyback out of the facility  and headed back towards the stairwell.</p>
<p><em>Damn these  bastards…What were they trying to get out of her? Did something  happen to Kazuya? Did she see it happen? Akane…what…what happened  to you…?</em></p>
<p>It took a little longer  to make it out of the facility than it did to get in, but once I  finally reached my entry point, I was thankful for the burst of fresh  air that hit me in the face when I pushed through the door.  Immediately, I called upon my child, and after delicately placing  Akane on his back, I whipped out my cell.</p>
<p>“Yamada.”</p>
<p>“<em>Kuga. How’d it  go?”</em></p>
<p>“I got her, but we  definitely need to get her to a doctor. Can that guy of yours take  her? It might be long term…”</p>
<p>“<em>Watanabe should  be able to. I’ll call him up to make sure.”</em></p>
<p>“Thanks. I’m going  to head in that direction, alright?”</p>
<p>“<em>Okay. I’ll meet  you there.”</em></p>
<p>Hanging up, I turned to  my Child.</p>
<p>“Think you can carry  us both?”</p>
<p>The silver wolf just  emitted a low guttural noise and sent a mental wave of confirmation,  and with that signal, I straddled his back, getting a secure hold on  Akane before Duran switched over to flight mode and took off into the  night.</p>
