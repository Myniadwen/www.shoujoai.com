<h1>Sailor HIME (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/sailorhime-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;I object!&quot; Midori Sugiura declared, the reddish-brown
haired woman waving her arms, her trenchcoat swirling
around her. They stood gathered in the cafeteria of
Fuka academy, one of the few areas large enough for
all the people she asked to come.

&quot;What are you up to now, Midori?&quot; Yoko Sagisawa asked,
her dark brown hair falling into the nurse&#39;s eyes.

&quot;And what are you objecting to?&quot; Mai Tokiha asked, her
orange hair a bit messy as usual and dressed in her
matching Fuka school uniform. Standing nearby and
watching curiously was Mikoto Mingi, the black haired
younger girl looking remarkably cute.

&quot;How can the author do a Hime fanfiction without any
actual Hime in it?&quot; Midori demanded, &quot;It&#39;s unfair!&quot;

&quot;Now, now,&quot; Reito Kansaki tried to calm her down, his
black uniform suiting his good looks, &quot;it was just a
Sailor Moon spoof.&quot;

&quot;And there you go with that now, now again,&quot; Haruka
Suzushiro growled as the light brown haired woman
continued, &quot;it&#39;s so annoying!&quot;

&quot;Haruka,&quot; Yukino Kikukawa sighed softly, pushing her
glasses up.

&quot;Considering the quality of the fanfiction,&quot; Shizuru
Fujino pointed out mildly, &quot;we&#39;re probably better off
out of it.&quot; She calmly drank some of her tea, the dark
brown haired woman smiling mysteriously.

&quot;You got that right,&quot; Natsuki Kuga growled, her black
hair falling in a straight wave down her shoulders.

&quot;Though I would have liked to see Natsuki dressed in
one of those costumes,&quot; Shizuru added softly.

&quot;Shizuru!&quot; Natsuki scolded.

&quot;What sort of costumes are they, Mai?&quot; Mikoto asked
and Mai bent over to explain. After a moment Mikoto
blinked, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be easier if Natsuki wore some
of that underwear we saw instead?&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; Natsuki growled at them.

Akane Higurashi sighed softly as she said, &quot;At least
if it was a Hime fic we might get a bit more screen
time.&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot; her boyfriend Kazuya Kurauchi said,
&quot;since the author prefers lesbians they&#39;d be featured
more, not us.&quot;

&quot;So we&#39;d lose screen time to the Ambiguously Lesbian
Duo over there?!&quot; Akane protested as she stared across
the room.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Chie Harada protested, &quot;We are not Ambiguously
Lesbian!&quot;

Aoi Seno held onto Chie&#39;s arm sweetly as she added,
&quot;We came out a few weeks ago.&quot;

&quot;See what I mean?&quot; Kazuya sighed to Akane.

&quot;I&#39;m probably not even going to get featured,&quot; Yuichi
Tate groaned, face down on the table as his orange
hair was lightly stroked.

&quot;There, there,&quot;Shiho Munakata petted him, &quot;you&#39;ll
always have me, big brother.&quot;

Yuichi groaned again, louder.

&quot;I think we should all march on the author&#39;s offices
and demand our very own fic!&quot; Midori declared.

&quot;And he&#39;s going to listen to you because...?&quot; Nao
Yuuki asked sarcastically, her red hair suiting her
sexy aura.

&quot;We&#39;ll demonstrate our commitment to carrying off a
story,&quot; and with that Midori whipped off her
trenchcoat to reveal what she was wearing underneath.

&quot;Eeep,&quot; Mai slapped a hand over Mikoto&#39;s eyes
reflexedly even as she stared, wide eyed.

Midori was dressed in a sailor fuku, a match for the
Sailor Moon uniforms but on her it looked much more
revealing. Unlike most of the sailors her body was
fully developed, full breasts bouncing under clingy
fabric and her bottom nearly hanging out of the short
skirt.

&quot;You can&#39;t go out in that, it&#39;s nearly obscene,&quot;
Haruka yelled, cheeks red.

Yoko nodded, &quot;She&#39;s right, I don&#39;t want to imagine
what the students would think.&quot;

&quot;But you liked me wearing this last night,&quot; Midori
pouted.

Yoko slapped a hand over Midori&#39;s mouth as she glared
around the room, &quot;Pretend you didn&#39;t hear that.&quot;

&quot;Trust me, we&#39;re trying,&quot; Nao rolled her eyes, &quot;eew.&quot;
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Shizuru rose gracefully as she said, &quot;I feel
certain that there will be other fanfictions we can
star in.&quot; She reached out to take Natsuki&#39;s hand, &quot;Now
if you don&#39;t mind, Midori&#39;s summons interrupted us at
the best part.&quot;

&quot;Shizuru,&quot; Natsuki blushed, &quot;they do not need to know
that.&quot;

&quot;Too much information,&quot; Mai shook her head.

End

Notes: Just a short little piece on the Hime
characters, please don&#39;t take it too seriously. I&#39;m
not sure who first called Chie/Aoi the Ambiguously
Lesbian Duo but I think it was on Shoujoai.com
somewhere. Yoko/Midori is also a complete product of
my imagination.</pre>
