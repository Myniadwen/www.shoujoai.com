<h1>Rearranged (part 6 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/betsunii.html">betsunii83</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/rearranged-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>The following week of school seemed to last an eternity for Natsuki. 
She would have skipped if it weren&#39;t for Shizuru insisting that she 
attend. School to her was just a stretch of time where she wasn&#39;t able to 
talk to or see Shizuru. Her friends at school couldn&#39;t help but notice 
the change in her behavior and attitude. She would daydream in class for 
the entire lesson, never really paying attention to anything that was 
going on. And when guys tried to talk to her, she would answer in a 
nonchalant tone instead of her usual biting sarcasm. Not to mention the 
glow that seemed to surround her and the small smile that was always on 
her lips. Determined to get to the bottom of this, Mai confronted her at 
lunch on Tuesday. 

&quot;Natsuki, what&#39;s up with you this week? You&#39;ve been acting 
differently.&quot;

&quot;Have I? I wonder...&quot;

&quot;Eh? What kind of an answer is that? Let me explain it to you: You have 
this dreamy look on your face all day and you haven&#39;t told off anybody 
once. If I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d say you were in love.&quot;

&quot;Why wouldn&#39;t I be in love, I mean--&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re saying you really are in love?&quot; Mai interrupted in 
disbelief.

A chorus of shocked exclamations arose from the rest of the girls at 
the table. Natsuki blushed as she became the focus of their rapt 
attention.

&quot;Ok, ok,&quot; said Mai excitedly, &quot;you have to tell us who he is!&quot;

&quot;Uh, well, I don&#39;t really feel like saying right now...&quot; Natsuki 
replied hesitantly.

&quot;Does Fujino-san know?&quot; asked Haruka.

Natsuki&#39;s blush deepened, &quot;Well, you see...&quot;

&quot;Why would it matter if Fujino-san knew?&quot; asked Mikoto innocently.

&quot;Because Fujino-san&#39;s in lo--,&quot; began Haruka before Yukino clapped a 
hand over her mouth.

&quot;More importantly, does this person know you love them?&quot; asked Mai.

&quot;Um, y-yeah...&quot; Natsuki was becoming a little worried at the direction 
this conversation was taking.

&quot;Ah! So that means they must be in love with you too if they know you 
love them and you&#39;re in such a good mood all the time.&quot; A wicked grin 
appeared on Mai&#39;s face, &quot;Hmmm, so have you guys, you know, kissed 
or...maybe even more?&quot;

Natsuki didn&#39;t want to answer that question. Her eyes darted around, 
trying not to look at anyone, and her face turned a brighter shade of 
red, if possible. Of course, this reaction told the group of girls the 
answer to that question and they all gasped in shock. The shock was soon 
replaced by a series of ooo&#39;s and catcalls, and Natsuki wished she could 
disappear.

&quot;Natsuki.&quot;

Natsuki&#39;s head whipped around at the sound of that voice. Sure enough, 
Shizuru herself was walking towards her down the row of tables, a 
bright smile on her face. The group of girls watched in fascination as 
Natsuki seemed to zone out everything around her, her gaze and attention 
focused solely on the approaching woman. They watched as she got up from 
her sitting position at the lunch table and headed for Fujino-san, 
stopping in close proximity to her.

&quot;Shizuru...what brings you here?&quot; Natsuki looked at her questioningly.

&quot;Ara! Well, besides wanting to see my lovely Natsuki-chan, I also 
wanted to bring you these cookies I made this morning.&quot; Shizuru presented a 
neatly wrapped package to the girl, her eyes lighting as Natsuki 
carefully took it from her, their hands grazing each other&#39;s briefly.

Their eyes met in an intense look they&#39;d become accustomed to sharing 
lately. Knowing this wasn&#39;t the time or the place, they broke the stare. 
Natsuki cleared her throat and Shizuru let out a gentle laugh.

&quot;Take care Natsuki. Call me when you get out of school, ne?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, ok, I&#39;ll talk to you then. Thanks for the cookies.&quot;

&quot;Of course, I hope you enjoy them.&quot;

With that, Shizuru left the premises as Natsuki returned to her group 
of friends. During the entire exchange, the group of girls had observed 
every detail of the interaction between the two. There was a certain 
level of intimacy between them that hadn&#39;t existed before. And that 
heated look that had passed between them could definitely not be overlooked. 
So when Natsuki returned, the knowing looks on their faces made her 
more than a little nervous. Shit, I&#39;ve been found out.

After she&#39;d sat down, Mai looked at the box of cookies and then looked 
back up at Natsuki&#39;s face. &quot;Fujino-san wouldn&#39;t happen to be the one 
that you&#39;re--&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Natsuki quickly interrupted, blushing hard.

Mai&#39;s eyebrows raised for an instant, but the look of surprise at 
Natsuki&#39;s admission was quickly replaced by a friendly smile, 
&quot;Congratulations.&quot;

Natsuki looked up at her friend&#39;s face and relaxed as she realized she 
was truly happy for her.

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

                          ********************

&quot;Well, everyone knows about us now, although I&#39;m sure that&#39;s exactly 
what you expected to happen.&quot; 

&quot;Ara? You say that as if you suspect I&#39;d planned the whole thing.&quot;

Natsuki was in her apartment talking to Shizuru over the phone. She was 
sprawled out across her bed, exhausted from the endless torrent of 
questions she&#39;d be answering about their relationship all day. Luckily, her 
friends all took the news in stride and seemed to be genuinely 
supportive of her.

&quot;Hmmm? Are you saying you didn&#39;t plan the whole thing?&quot;

&quot;Would it matter to you if I did?&quot;

&quot;Mmmm, I guess not.&quot;

&quot;Good, then I planned the whole thing. I want to make sure everyone 
knows Natsuki-chan is mine.&quot;

&quot;Well, you don&#39;t have to worry about that now. I&#39;m pretty sure that 
everyone knows.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I forgot to tell you, I talked to my parents and tomorrow night 
will work out for us to all eat dinner together. Is that ok with you?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;ll be fine. But...you don&#39;t think your parents will be able 
to tell do you? About us, that is.&quot;

&quot;Well, we&#39;ll just have to be discreet now won&#39;t we?&quot;

&quot;Yeah...discreet.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Natsuki, but I&#39;ve got to go, my mother is calling for me. 
I&#39;ll have a car come pick you up tomorrow at 6 for dinner. See you then!&quot;

&quot;Alright, bye.&quot;

Flipping her phone shut, Natsuki let out a sigh. Suddenly a thought hit 
her, What the hell am I going to wear?</pre>
