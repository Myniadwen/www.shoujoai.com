    <p>“So tell me again why you’re   not going to the lake for the semester-end party?” Chie asked quietly,   as she leaned against the doorframe to her best friend’s dormitory   flat. She felt nervous for some odd reason and had taken to twisting   the chain on her all-important cell phone to relieve some of the tension.   There was no rhyme or reason for her nervousness, when she really thought   about it. Chie had known Aoi for what seemed like an eternity; their   bond strong, yet fluid. It encased them like the warm arms of summer   every time they were together.</p>
    <p>“Chie-chan, you know that I   can’t afford to. It’s bad enough that I have to borrow money from   you sometimes to get by as it is.” Aoi replied, her voice muffled   by the blouse she pulled over her head as she dressed for work. The   spectacled girl drew in her breath with a slight hiss as she caught   a glimpse of Aoi’s ample cleavage before the shirt settled over her   slim torso.</p>
    <p>“Guess it wouldn’t do any   good to beg, plead and offer myself up to you as an incentive to come,   eh?” Chie joked, though she could barely hear the words; her heart   was knocking around in her chest like a <em>taiko</em> drum.</p>
    <p>“Tempting, but I can’t this   time.” Aoi blinked back hidden tears when she thought of how frustrating   it was to have to miss out on spending time with her <em>What? Wishful   thinking kind of lover?</em> friend. She was thankful that someone chose   to knock at the door at that precise moment. Stepping past Chie to open   it, she brushed just close enough to illicit a poorly concealed moan   from her. With a hint of a mischievous grin to the gossip hound for   good measure, Aoi greeted the caller in her usual effusive manner.</p>
    <p>“Midori-san! What brings you   here?”</p>
    <p>“Actually, I was looking for   that hellraiser roommate of yours,” Midori chuckled.</p>
    <p>“I think she said she was going   to the cafeteria to get something to eat. She skipped lunch today.”</p>
    <p>“And class, too, apparently,”   the boisterous teacher muttered <em>sotto voce</em>.</p>
    <p>“Pardon me?”</p>
    <p>“Hmm? Oh it’s nothing, nothing   at all. I’m just getting together a little bit of entertainment and   I was sure that she’d want to play.”</p>
    <p>Midori’s announcement piqued   the interest of Chie who had been standing out of sight until that point.</p>
    <p>“Entertainment, eh? If you’re   setting this up, that can’t be good. It probably won’t even be legal,”   Chie smirked.</p>
    <p>“Oi, Mashiro forgave me for   that Iron Chef thing already. Besides,” Midori performed some sleight   of hand and a deck of Las Vegas style playing cards appeared. A slow   devious smile slid across her face as she flipped the deck back and   forth between her fingers. “Who can resist a friendly game of skill?” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Awww Natsuki, everyone else   is playing. Don’t ruin the fun. Come join us,” Mai pleaded, tugging   on her classmate’s sleeve to emphasize her request. She and Shizuru   had been on their way for a night of shopping in the city when Mai intercepted   them near the student common room. Midori soon showed up with the other   HiMEs (except for Yukino, who begged off, claiming that Haruka had assigned   her several tasks for the upcoming sakura viewing party that needed   to be done on Suzushiro-time) and Chie (“<em>What? You think I’m   going to miss out on Midori’s wild party? Not a chance!</em>) to see   how Mai would manage to get the school’s most inaccessible student   to do the unexpected.</p>
    <p>“No!”</p>
    <p>“Midori said that it would just   be a game of cards, Natsuki. How bad could it be?”</p>
    <p>A scowl of disapproval creased   her brow at the mention of their troublesome teacher’s name. “I   haven’t forgotten her last HiME bonding attempt,” she growled, recalling   the quite dreadful (though some would say totally hilarious) karaoke   party.</p>
    <p>Mai winced at the shared recollection.   She had to admit that wasn’t one of their shining moments…still   it had been rather fun. Not one to give up easily, she knew that she’d   have no choice but to use her final option. “Say, didn’t you tell   me that you owed me one for that time Mikoto and I saved you from Alyssa-chan?</p>
    <p>Natsuki crossed her arms and shook   her head in dissent. “Oi oi, don’t try to guilt me into this, Tokiha.   I don’t plan on spending my Friday night getting involved with anything   Miss Justice here came up with. You all can play your silly little game   without me, right Shizuru?” the dark haired biker tossed her best   friend a meaningful look, praying to any <em>kami</em> who would listen   that she got the hint.</p>
    <p>Shizuru’s eyes danced with mischief   as she pretended to consider the matter thoroughly. Every tap tap tap   of a finger on her lovely chin, echoed in Natsuki’s head like a knell   of doom. Her eyebrow twitched in anticipation of the decision that was   sure to come.</p>
    <p>“I think this would be enjoyable.   I do not get to do such things very often. Anyway, we can always go   shopping tomorrow,” Shizuru said in an offhand manner as she wandered   over to place a calm hand on Natsuki’s arm. The biker girl knew this   was a bad sign. Shizuru deliberately made the gesture as a way of keeping   her from losing her temper in front of the others. While it was helpful,   it only served to make her looked more whipped than she already was.</p>
    <p>Midori clapped a hand over her   mouth to control a bad case of the giggles as she noticed the erstwhile   HiME’s crestfallen face. She almost fell out laughing altogether when   Mai burst out, “Yes!! Thank you, Shizuru-san!”</p>
    <p>Natsuki shot a dark look at Shizuru,   whose own expression remained as placid as ever. “Arggh! Fine! Damn   it, fine!” She ran an annoyed hand through her hair and tried desperately   to maintain the attitude of cool aloofness that she was famous for.   “So…what are we playing anyway?” she asked of no one in particular.</p>
    <p>“Strip poker.” </p>
