Part: Two

After the other night, Shizuru had great urges to be Natsuki more and 
more. When she was at her house waiting for Natsuki to call she often 
wondered if the other girl actually felt the same way. Sure the 
dark-haired girl had said she loved her, but was that just spur of the 
moment? Shizuru would remember the day of the HiME Festival, where 
Natsuki had told her the opposite&#151;but why this, now? It was rather 
random, not that she was complaining really. She was just... Curious. A 
lot of things weren&#39;t making sense to her now. However, unlike the last 
time, she had plenty of time to sit and just think about what is going 
on, instead of racing to protect Natsuki.

A week later---

Just as Shizuru sat down on her couch, she was about to take a sip of 
some new tea Natsuki had bought her the other day, her cell phone began 
to vibrate then an oh-so familiar ring tone began to ring. It was one of 
Natsuki&#39;s favorite songs- &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; by OK Go. This tone ring 
was only inspired after the dark-haired girl had seen the new Nike 
commercial.

In a couple of weeks it would be the week that they all would be going 
out camping. And today Natsuki was going to pick up Shizuru and they 
would go shopping at Nick&#39;s Sporting Goods. At first, Shizuru thought 
the shopping wasn&#39;t going to be much fun, but she quickly changed her 
mind after a while.

Shizuru knew how this day was going to end. It was simple: they go 
shopping, come back, un-pack whatever they bought, have a cup of tea, 
watch some TV then they would get snuggly and things would move on from 
there. This was a dream come true for Shizuru; however, she was rather 
surprised by how Natsuki was dealing with this. It was like they had 
been going out with each other for a year or something. But she knew not 
to push Natsuki to far.

However, that never stopped her from fantasizing... The sound of an 
engine snapped her out of her happy trance. She rose off of the couch 
and walked over to the door. She peaked outside and saw a stunning 
dark-haired girl pull off her helmet and lay it onto of her black and 
blue Yamaha YZF-R6 motorbike.

Closing the door and propping herself against it; Shizuru started to 
burst out in a fit of giggles. She stopped herself and walked briskly 
back to the couch and sat down&#151;knowing what would happen.

Someone knocked on the door and Shizuru sat up happily. She practically 
danced over to the door and noted to herself how childish she was 
acting. She stopped at the door. Inhale. Exhale. She calmed herself down 
and opened the door.

&quot;Hello,&quot; Shizuru&#39;s voice rang out to the person at the door.

&quot;Why hello, Shizuru-chan,&quot; came a nasal filled voice.

Shizuru opened her eyes to see a man with swirling glasses and a 
short-chubby figure standing in front of her.

She was completely confused and shocked and just wanted to close the 
door. Just before she could laughter began to sound out from next to the 
door. It was a very familiar voice and she knew exactly who it was.

As the tall brown-haired girl stepped out into the hall and peered over 
to her right; she spotted the dark-haired girl squatting against the 
wall, hands gripping her stomach and laughing so hard that nothing was 
heard.

As the dark-haired girl looked up with tears brimming at her eyes she 
saw that Shizuru was blushing and her laugh only grew louder.

Shizuru, not wanting to get mad at Natsuki, but yet really embarrassed 
about this incident: she decided to just try and forget about it and 
turn the tables. Shizuru turned to the man, &quot;Hello, how are you? Would 
you care to come inside?&quot; she gestured for him to enter her small 
apartment.

&quot;Well... If you wouldn&#39;t mind... That is,&quot; the man flustered with words 
and nervously adjusted his glasses higher on his nose.

With that, Shizuru stepped aside and allowed the man to walk in and 
closed the door swiftly after him: leaving the dark-haired girl outside.

After catching her breath while the scene unfolded. Natsuki stood up and 
looked dumbfounded at the door. Being as stubborn as she is; she stood 
outside the door not knocking or even wanting to say she was sorry.

On the inside, Shizuru knew what Natsuki was doing and decided to leave 
her out in the cold for a while more while she got the tea prepared. 
After she turned the water on, she turned towards the man with the swirl 
glasses. &quot;By the way, might I ask who you are?&quot; Shizuru asked bluntly.

The man, already prepared for this, because this was the first time he 
had seen Shizuru himself; he cleared his throat and began, &quot;My name is 
Salavar Flantan, I work with Natsuki at the Auto Body Repair Shop, but I 
also work at Nick&#39;s Sporting Goods. So I offered to accompany you two 
female specimens to my work place. This way I could point you towards 
the proper gear and even allow you to have a &quot;workers only&quot; discount,&quot; 
he finished with a glint of pride coming from his glasses.

&quot;Well... Why thank you...&quot; she paused, slightly taken aback from his 
wording, &quot;What made you be our gracious helper?&quot; She asked, wondering 
how Natsuki bullied him into doing this for them.

&quot;Do not worry. I was not forced into this,&quot; it was as if he read her 
mind, &quot;Natsuki helped me out at the auto body shop when I my sister was 
sick and she even used my time card because she knew that I was having 
financial problems, so I got the money for her work. So, I felt bothered 
by this and once I heard she was to travel to Nick&#39;s I knew immediately 
that if I were not to help her, I would be guilty for the rest of my 
days,&quot; he spoke honestly.

Shizuru slightly shocked about how nice Natsuki could be. But she shook 
her head and told herself that Natsuki was truly a kind person and this 
shouldn&#39;t surprise her in the least bit. Then she remembered where 
Natsuki was exactly. She turned back and opened the door. Not seeing 
Natsuki right away, she walked out and saw her sitting against the wall 
next to the door. &quot;If you&#39;ll excuse me,&quot; Shizuru said politely to 
Salavar as she walked out the door and closed it behind her.

She looked down at Natsuki with gentle eyes. Natsuki looked at her with 
a normal gaze. Then the brown-haired girl walked around to the other 
side of the sitting girl and sat next to her. Natsuki looked at her 
questionably. But Shizuru just closed her eyes and leaned her head onto 
the dark-haired girls shoulder. Natsuki then turned her head and was 
about to mutter a response, but decided against it and just sighed; 
resting her head against the other girls.

With the warm sun heating up their shoes and exposed skin from wearing 
shorts, it felt rather relaxing in this position... If only people 
wouldn&#39;t look at them weirdly as they past, thought Natsuki. Who was 
glaring at every one of them.

&quot;I love you,&quot; a mutter was barely audible to the dark-haired girls ears.

&quot;Huh,&quot; came the response.

&quot;We better get shopping before the store closes,&quot; said the brown-haired 
girl with a sly smile spreading her lips.

They both stood up reluctantly, but knowing very well what they had to 
do. They walked inside and back out with Salavar and the three of them 
continued to Nick&#39;s Sporting Goods.</pre>
