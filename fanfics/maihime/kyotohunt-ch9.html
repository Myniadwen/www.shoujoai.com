<h1>The Kyoto Hunt (part 9 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/asinistre.html">Ange Sinistre</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/kyotohunt-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>&quot;Fury&quot;

He lived in a secluded section of Kyoto. His home was surrounded by 
thick trees and plant life, a large stone wall surrounding the boundary 
of his property. There were security cameras as well, but they had been 
spotted early on. They were not that reckless as to storm into such a 
place without proper observation. Each of them were dressed in black in 
order to blend in with the night. The crescent moon above provided 
little light to guide their path. As a camera panned away, the three of 
them scaled the wall and dropped to the ground. The trio of women 
sprinted silently to the wall and pressed their backs to it so that the 
camera would not be able to spot them as it panned back around. There 
mission was simple, given to them by a revitalized Mai, no longer held 
back by her insecurities about not having her power. She began to 
resemble herself during the trying parts of the Carnival, angry and 
determined.

&quot;I want you to find out everything about the Otome from Miyu&#39;s target; 
how they work, how their powers can be deactivated, and how the Emulator 
can be taken out. I&#39;ve had enough of this. Do whatever it takes,&quot; Mai 
had ordered.

The platinum haired android led the way, Midori having relinquished 
power temporarily to allow Miyu to take point. Her cybernetic eyes had 
night and heat vision. She stood a far greater chance of noticing 
something in their path. She marched forward, and physically ripped 
another camera from an opposite wall before it became a problem. The 
three stood outside an oak door, and the two elder women turned to their 
younger companion. Midori handed over a small hairclip and Nao 
immediately lowered herself to one knee and inserted it into the door 
lock. With a few quick motions, Nao successfully picked the lock, and 
gently opened it.

Miyu scanned the darkened house with her artificial eyes, and detected 
no life forms in the rooms just ahead of them. They exited the kitchen 
and crept up the stairs, the two human women with their weapons at the 
ready. It didn&#39;t take Miyu long to find the bedroom in which their 
target was located. He was a middle-aged and overweight businessman. A 
not so attractive woman slept next to him. Children were likely in the 
other rooms. They would have to be quiet. Miyu turned to the others and 
nodded once.

In an instant, both occupants of the bed were dragged to their feet. As 
the wife let out a small yelp, Nao slammed a hand over her mouth from 
behind and held her tightly in place, her grip nothing less than iron. 
The woman struggled and her eyes darted to the side to try and see who 
her attacker was. It was no use. Midori held the man, though she 
mentally complained that his girth was a nuisance when it came to 
wrapping her arms around him to hold him in place. She managed, for the 
moment.

Miyu stood in front of him, acting as interrogator. She knew him well, 
after all. Her arm transformed into a blade, and she held the tip to his 
throat. His screamed under Midori&#39;s palm, and began to struggle, but 
Miyu pressed the blade even firmer against his flesh, threatening to 
break the skin. That quieted him down real fast. He was a higher ranking 
member of Searrs who had moved to Japan to help oversee the Valkyrie 
project during the Carnival. Miyu did not doubt for a moment that he was 
also involved with the Otome project. She had pulled his name from her 
database of Searrs information because of that.

&quot;Kobayashi Norio, if you do not answer my questions within a span of 
twenty seconds, I will slit your throat,&quot; Miyu began. &quot;As a member of 
the Valkyrie project, you are aware I can monitor human breathing. Any 
indication of a false answer will also result in your termination. Nod 
if you understand.&quot;

His eyes were as wide as saucers, and sweat began to build on his 
repulsive head, but he nodded after a few moments. His eyes darted to 
his wife for just a few moments, Nao&#39;s hold on her not losing any 
intensity as the interrogation began. Miyu&#39;s gaze did not waver from his 
face.

&quot;How are the Otome able to summon their robes and weapons?&quot; Her voice 
was monotone, and her digital brain began a countdown of twenty 
merciless seconds.

Midori moved her fingers off his mouth long enough for him to speak. At 
thirteen seconds into the countdown, he stammered out a truthful 
response, knowing full well that the Yggdrasil unit was capable of 
determining lies. &quot;T-they have gem earrings that are powered by an OL 
Emulator. Each gem stores a different robe and armor combination.&quot;

Miyu immediately moved into a follow-up question. &quot;They are dependent on 
the gems for materialization, then? They do not have the HiME blood 
required to manifest weapons themselves?&quot;

He shook his head after Midori once again freed his mouth. &quot;They have 
the blood, but it wasn&#39;t enough to materialize. Only actual HiME can do 
that. They entirely dependent on the gems.&quot;

&quot;How do the gems work?&quot; Miyu questioned.

With that, he paused. But he knew. Miyu could tell. His pulse and 
breathing quickened, indicating he was holding back information. As the 
countdown got to nine, she tightened the blade against his neck, he wife 
whimpering. That got him to talk. &quot;Okay, stop! The gems contain files 
modeled after Elements stored on the OL. Some are old HiME weapons, 
others are new, but you need the proper hormone and genetic information 
to materialize. The Emulator treats the gem like it&#39;s one of the HiME, 
so...&quot;

&quot;So?&quot; Miyu pried.

&quot;...So, we had to use... ah...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t make me draw blood, Norio,&quot; Miyu warned. &quot;I will not give you 
another warning.&quot;

&quot;Only a real HiME can use the Obsidian Lord&#39;s wave structure, whether 
it&#39;s the real thing or an Emulator. That means we had to use genetic 
information from an existing HiME. The gems are made with their genetic 
data. And, like the real Obsidian Lord, the Emulator needs a &#39;Crystal 
Princess&#39; to fuel it, and... so... we have a HiME body bound to the 
machine. For the gems to have the right hormone levels, we had to make 
them from someone who&#39;d given birth, and...&quot;

It was Nao who replied, her anger making her snap at the realization. 
Only one of the HiME had not been seen thusfar. &quot;What the hell did you 
sick bastards do to Sister?!&quot;

&quot;Is Sanada Yukariko alive?&quot; Miyu questioned, turning to Nao briefly in 
order to get her to hush.

He found himself scrambling for words. &quot;N-no... well, yes, sort of. 
She&#39;s in suspended animation within the Emulator. She&#39;s physically 
alive, but if disconnected, it&#39;s not likely that she will survive 
outside the core.&quot;

&quot;What happened to her child?&quot; Miyu was ever patient, unlike her rowdy 
companions. There was something to be said for having a computerized 
brain.

He shook his head. &quot;I-I don&#39;t know. Honestly. It&#39;s not something I ever 
learned. I swear! Please, get out of here!&quot;

Midori looked over, as if to ask if he was indeed telling the truth. 
Miyu nodded, not detecting an anomaly in his physical condition. She 
then took the information Kuga had discovered into consideration. &quot;Very 
well. Yukariko then acts as all the Otome&#39;s Keys, correct? Is there a 
way to power down the Emulator without harming Sanada-san?&quot;

&quot;The primary power supply is connected to a generator in another room. 
If you can shut down the connection, everything should be fine. I think. 
It was something they added after I got ousted from the project,&quot; he 
said. He hoped to god his children wouldn&#39;t wake up. &quot;I don&#39;t know if 
the Emulator itself can power itself anymore. I only worked on the 
gems.&quot;

&quot;Where is the exact location of the Emulator?&quot; Miyu had almost all she 
needed to know.

&quot;They moved it a long time after I got out of the project. I&#39;m sorry, I 
don&#39;t know which base it&#39;s at.&quot; Damn. They knew which base it was at, 
but the complex was huge. It&#39;d take too much time to find it, even if 
they split up. They needed a building number or something. They&#39;d be 
mauled if they went straight for it without a plan.

Miyu withdrew her blade. &quot;The interrogation is complete. I have all I 
need to know. We may leave.&quot;

Midori spoke next, her usually upbeat personality showing heavy signs of 
hate and malice with the knowledge they had just learned. Midori 
tightened her grip on the Searrs officer before she dared to let go, her 
voice low and threatening. She spoke to both parents, looking over to 
the wife to make sure she understood. &quot;You can call the police if you 
want. It won&#39;t do you any good. I suggest you just go back to sleep and 
don&#39;t make a sound. You wouldn&#39;t want your kids to see you like this, 
would you?&quot;

Nao released the wife, who opened her mouth the scream, but it only came 
out as a sharp intake of breath. The brawler stalked forward, her fists 
tight. For however aloof the redhead tried to be, when it came to the 
HiME, the few people she had in her life that mattered, she found 
herself disturbed and livid. He&#39;d condemned Yukariko to virtual death. 
He&#39;d killed, essentially, one of her compatriots. And so, with Midori 
still holding him, Nao swung her arm out and backhanded him roughly in 
the face, making sure her metal knuckles (blades retracted) hit him 
right on the forehead. He stifled a scream as a loud &#39;thunk&#39; from her 
weapon could be heard making contact with him.

The wife looked away, and Nao marched back out into the hall without a 
word. Midori released him, and she and Miyu retreated as well, heading 
back out into the night. They were off to Mai&#39;s apartment once again, 
Tate having been briefed on the recent events. Well... now what were 
they going to do?

- - -

&quot;Do you hate them, Allison?&quot;

A simple enough question, and it warranted a simple enough answer. Onyx, 
her codename not in use while they were off duty, looked over from her 
desk to gaze at the blonde who asked it. The Otome had crowded into her 
room in between missions to pass the time (never mind that she had work 
to do), and the discussion had shifted from the light hearted to the 
serious. &quot;No.&quot;

Eve was fiddling with a conventional shotgun, cleaning it, and added to 
the discussion after Celeste had asked the question. &quot;They&#39;re just the 
first hurdle we have to cross in order for the Golden Millennium to go 
into effect. It&#39;s not supposed to be easy. But they&#39;re nothing more than 
targets. Remember that.&quot;

&quot;I try not to let my emotions run away with me,&quot; Celeste replied, 
&quot;though it&#39;s frustrating. Yuuki, in particular, proves to be difficult 
when it comes to my patience. Perhaps I&#39;m just defensive. I don&#39;t know.&quot;

Morgana sighed. They were all so damn businesslike. Sonia seemed to 
agree, and spoke up. &quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with putting a bit of 
passion into a mission. Finding yourself angry at them can help motivate 
you in a fight. I don&#39;t hate them, but they&#39;re the enemy. I do not like 
them. I do not like to be around them. They&#39;re the cause of all our 
trouble.&quot;

Allison paused. That they were. &quot;Just so long as you don&#39;t get too 
carried away with your emotions to the point where you become a threat 
to yourself and everyone around you.&quot;

Her gaze, as well as a few others, shifted to Morgana, and she 
stiffened. She would have apologized, but that might have made her look 
weak to the others. She was new. They didn&#39;t want to hear a rookie 
mumble out &#39;I&#39;m sorry&#39; twenty times a day, like she was unable to be 
anything other than a nuisance. She remained silent. There was nothing 
more to say on the matter.

&quot;I admit that they are frustrating,&quot; Allison continued, writing 
something on a sheet of paper. &quot;Very. But the Emulator gets more 
operational every day, and our gems are getting more and more 
functional. They have no powers. It should be no problem.&quot;

It was her attempt to reassure them. Celeste shrugged, reading a book as 
she sat on Onyx&#39;s desk. &quot;Fair enough.&quot;

- - -

Natsuki was comfortably warm, and woke when the morning light passed 
through the thin walls of her home. Shizuru had escorted her back to 
their room, where they both fell almost immediately to sleep, blankets 
still wrapped around them both. Natsuki was nestled against the other 
woman, her cheek resting in between Shizuru&#39;s neck and chest. She shut 
her eyes again and tried to ignore the light, but knew full well that 
she wouldn&#39;t be able to go to sleep. Burying her face further into 
Shizuru&#39;s flesh and mane, she hoped to escape it. But could not.

Her cellphone ringing did not help matters. She withdrew it from her 
pocket, still clothed from the night before, and grumbled, &quot;Kuga.&quot;

&quot;Come to my apartment at noon. We need to have a little meeting.&quot; Mai, 
who&#39;s voice harbored a great deal of anger and frustration. Shizuru 
began to wake and squirm under Natsuki, rolling onto her other side and 
muttering a swear word accented in Kyoto-ben.

Natsuki, worried about Mai&#39;s tone of voice, asked, &quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot;

&quot;Just get down here.&quot;

All she heard after that was dial tone. Natsuki turned the device off 
and returned it to her pocket, sitting up and giving Shizuru a chance to 
properly move without her weighing the woman down. Seeing that Shizuru 
was not intent on moving, Natsuki took her by the shoulder and pushed 
her. An irritated groan followed, and Shizuru waved her arm behind her 
to swat at Natsuki.

&quot;What?&quot; Shizuru complained.

&quot;Wake up.&quot;

The instant reply was, &quot;What time is it?&quot;

And, likewise, the counter was an expected, &quot;Time to get up. Now move.&quot;

&quot;Ara, be sweet to me,&quot; Shizuru grumbled. &quot;You&#39;re never sweet to me. 
You&#39;re a mean spirited, bitter woman who seeks only to inflict suffering 
and pain upon those you care most about in the early hours of the 
morning.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s ten.&quot;

&quot;...It is not.&quot; With that final statement, Shizuru pulled the blankets 
over her head like a rebellious child unwilling to wake for school. 
There she sat for several long minutes while Natsuki stared at the bump 
that indicated where the woman was located. Well, fine. If that&#39;s the 
way she wanted to play, so be it. Natsuki got out of bed and exited the 
house, leaving Shizuru in peace. The Kyoto woman fell back into a state 
of slumber, or at least halfway, by the time the biker returned.

From the well.

She held a small cup of liquid in her hands, and after flinging off the 
blankets, she poured it directly on Shizuru, who bolted upright in 
alarm, covering her head and upper body from the onslaught. That was it. 
She was forced to surrender, and she did just that. &quot;Ara, fine! I&#39;m 
awake!&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Natsuki said, &quot;now bathe, change your clothes, and come with me 
to Mai&#39;s.&quot;

Shizuru was wiping the water off of face, still not entirely awake and 
certainly not ready to go off on any adventures. &quot;M-Mai? Why are we 
going to Mai&#39;s? I don&#39;t want to talk to Mai, I want to sleep &#150; and not 
with you, at least not anymore. I swear, the Otome better have launched 
a nuclear warhead to warrant this kind of awakening.&quot;

&quot;I do not have the details, but I assume the worst,&quot; Natsuki explained. 
She began to head out towards the bath, preparing to take one herself. 
She turned back around. &quot;By the way, you have drool on your face.&quot;

&quot;Ara?&quot; Shizuru blinked and attempted to wipe any possible drool (she did 
not drool!) off the side of her mouth... and then realized that Natsuki 
had tricked her. She could see a subtle grin on the biker&#39;s face as she 
walked away and outside. She&#39;d fallen for her own trick. &quot;Dammit, 
woman.&quot;

- - -

If Shizuru was difficult to wake, then Haruka was impossible. The 
officer was still half asleep when Yukino quite literally dragged her 
through the door. Akira had no problem waking, and had been up since 
dawn. Takumi was another story. She&#39;d left him to sleep in during the 
HiME meeting. The same went for Akane and now-husband Kazuya. The rest 
slowly but surely piled into Mai&#39;s apartment around noon, the redhead 
and Tate having food prepared for them to offset any large amounts of 
irritation from being woken up after a long night. The ones who had it 
the worst were the three &#150; well, two, as Miyu didn&#39;t count thanks to her 
seventy-two hour battery life &#150; who had their mission the night before. 
Immediately after their arrival, everyone could tell something was 
seriously wrong.

The news hit them hard. Sister Yukariko had been a guide to all of them 
during their younger years, serving as a counselor and as a mentor. As a 
human being, not simply as one of the HiME, she did not deserve the kind 
of treatment she received. No one deserved to be used in such a manner. 
Each of the surviving warriors reacted in different ways. Nao was ready 
to snap at anyone who looked at her wrong. Midori was downtrodden, which 
for her meant quite a bit. Shiho had fallen into somber silence. Then, 
came the question...

&quot;In order to stop Searrs we have to face Yukariko&#39;s actual death.&quot; Mai 
was fully stepping back into leader mode. &quot;I know... I know it&#39;s going 
to be hard, but we don&#39;t have a lot of options. To stop the Otome, 
either by killing them or destroying the Emulator, she may have to go 
with them.&quot;

&quot;I am not killing Sister,&quot; Akane adamantly said.

Nao was the first to bite back at that. &quot;Then, what? Do you want Searrs 
to get away with even more shit? Sacrifices are sometimes necessary. 
Yukariko would understand perfectly. She&#39;s pretty much dead as it is, 
anyway.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say such things,&quot; Yukino replied, never having had much tolerance 
for morbid thoughts.

Natsuki put in her two sense. &quot;I think Nao&#39;s right. It&#39;s something that 
is, unfortunately, necessary. Unless any of you know some Mashiro-esque 
tricks to get us out of this, I&#39;m afraid we have no choice.&quot;

&quot;But can you live with the guilt?&quot; Shiho asked. She already had enough 
sins weighing on her conscience. She didn&#39;t need to add the murder of a 
former nun to it, even if she would only be an accomplice.

&quot;The path to justice isn&#39;t always just,&quot; Midori said, her voice in a 
sullen monotone.

Nao nodded. &quot;Exactly. The ends justify the means, and I do not want 
Searrs to keep running around and treating people like a commodity. If 
we don&#39;t stop the Otome and the project now, who knows how many other 
HiME will be sacrificed to power their damn fake soldiers. It needs to 
be stopped now, and if Yukariko or any of us have to die for that cause, 
then so be it.&quot;

&quot;How can you be so callous?&quot; Akane questioned. &quot;You of all people should 
know how difficult it is to let go of someone who&#39;s neither dead nor 
truly aliv&#151;&quot;

&quot;Shut up, Akane!&quot; Nerve hit.

Natsuki winced. A low blow, indeed. She could see Akane shrinking back 
and hiding behind a now fully alert Haruka before the redhead could take 
her anger out physically. This was getting intense. &quot;Calm down, the both 
of you. Miyu, isn&#39;t there another option?&quot;

The android, who had been watching the arguments from a detached 
viewpoint, finally spoke up. &quot;The officer made mention of the primary 
power supply being a separate piece of equipment. Yukariko may 
technically live if we can power the Emulator down by destroying that 
power supply. I do caution, however, that he said Sanada-san cannot live 
outside the Emulator. Perhaps if we wrestle Searrs science officers into 
submission, they can revitalize her.&quot;

Mai, seeing that as an opportunity to make peace, stepped in again. 
&quot;Then that is what we&#39;ll shoot for. Yukino, I want you to get to work on 
making detailed points of attack on the main complex. We should have one 
team head for the power supply, another to deal with the Otome and 
guards, and another to... find the Emulator and possibly destroy it 
should that method fail. Someone should also deal with destroying their 
computer network, so they can&#39;t access the project files later.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan to me,&quot; Natsuki concurred. Several others nodded in 
agreement. Natsuki, however, continued on. &quot;The problem is we don&#39;t know 
where the Emulator is, exactly. The Searrs complex is huge and 
supposedly has a large tunnel network, according to the JSDF satellites 
and the layout we have from Miyu&#39;s database. It&#39;ll be suicide to run 
through the whole thing trying to find the Emulator.&quot;

Yukino piped up. &quot;Actually, I thought of a plan for that.&quot;

Heads turned around to face the spectacled girl, each eager to hear. 
Haruka blinked. &quot;What? When was this? I don&#39;t remember you planning 
anything.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re simply unobservant, Haruka-chan,&quot; Yukino replied, causing the 
blonde to make a disappointed face. She opened her purse and pulled out 
a small box containing a small piece of metal that looked quite like a 
bullet. &quot;It&#39;s a simple transmitter. I imagine the Otome would regroup 
near the Emulator after a fight. I made it so that it could be fired 
from a .357 caliber weapon. Natsuki, if you can fire this into an Otome, 
we can follow them back to base. It&#39;s a long shot, but better than 
nothing.&quot;

The biker took the small device and examined it. &quot;It should fit in the 
revolvers, yes. Their armor seems to stop most rounds, though. It 
stopped a shot from my Desert Eagles.&quot;

&quot;Yes, one of the melee fighters will have to tear open their armor 
enough to where you can get a piercing shot in,&quot; Yukino said. She then 
shrugged. &quot;Perhaps Mikoto with her claymore, or Midori with her axe. 
Miyu and her arm blade may stand a chance.&quot;

Miyu nodded. &quot;I will go. What do you intend to do to lure the Otome 
out?&quot;

With that, Midori finally broke into a smile. &quot;Cause a ruckus.&quot;

Mai sighed. &quot;I think the sensei has a plan of her own, now.&quot;

- - -

Having all of them go out in full force threatened to result in all 
Otome being deployed. They just wanted one or two to tango with. As 
such, only a small group was sent out to &#39;cause a ruckus.&#39; They were 
back at the Searrs facility they were at during their last fight. Much 
of the forest outside the building was smoldering, the flames from 
Ruby&#39;s assault having been put out not long ago, leaving nothing behind. 
The HiME, however, strolled right on in. Most of the base had been 
abandoned, but a few bought off soldiers and Searrs agents remained to 
clean things up. An armored vehicle or two was around to carry vital 
items back to the main base.

Natsuki, Haruka, Miyu and Midori sat and watched one of the APCs explode 
in a plume of fire. A homemade bomb had been tossed beneath, and the 
potent device tore through the armor and ripped the vehicle open. In the 
absence of their Children, explosives seemed to be a worthy substitute. 
At once, soldiers and agents began to scatter and fall into defensive 
formations, using buildings as cover. The HiME, however, were ducked low 
and remained out of harm&#39;s way... for now. Harm&#39;s way was kind of them 
objective this time. Mai had drove them. She sat in a nondescript, 
rented SUV off the main road outside the complex, watching the fight 
from a safe distance.

&quot;Where did you learn to make those?&quot; Haruka asked, glaring at the 
teacher. That was breaching several laws. As a police lieutenant, she 
had a right to know.

Midori smiled back cheerfully. &quot;I learned it from the great 
It&#39;s-a-Secret Institute of Higher Education and Explosives.&quot;

Haruka grumbled something vulgar as Midori stood up, axe in hand, and 
raced out across the complex to duel with anyone brave enough to try. 
Miyu followed behind, her arm shifting into a blade while both Haruka 
and Natsuki provided cover fire. The biker pulled back the hammer and 
let a bullet fly into a soldier scrambling for his weapon, and with 
another rapid shot, she shot another man&#39;s rifle from his hands. The 
transmitter bullet was strapped to the bandolier portion of her holster 
belt, waiting to go into use once the Otome showed up.

Midori and Miyu pried weapons out of soldier&#39;s hands and tore through 
agents as if they were nothing. In Miyu&#39;s case, she switched modes and 
pumped grenade rounds into vehicles and buildings, while Midori tossed 
one more homemade pipe bomb at an APC and let it go up in flames. It 
didn&#39;t take long, perhaps only twenty minutes, before Searrs support in 
the form of Otome showed up to play.

It was Onyx, Topaz and the turbulent Ruby, and they did not look happy. 
They ran up from the opposite side of the base, dropped off by their own 
armored car which likely contained the &#39;router&#39; needed to materialize so 
far from the main Emulator. Onyx was at the forefront of their group, 
marching towards the HiME with her pole-axe already in hand. The HiME 
balked at her presence for just a short moment, giving her time to spit 
out the very frustration her teammates had been talking about earlier.

&quot;What is the point of this?&quot; Onyx demanded. She held out her arms to the 
wounded, dead and disarmed. &quot;What could you possibly be after here? 
You&#39;ve already had your way with this facility, damn it. I am getting 
sick of you putting my teammates at risk for whatever twisted delusions 
you have. You act like miserable and despicable vandals.&quot;

Topaz already had her chain mace materialized. &quot;I think they&#39;re calling 
us out, actually.&quot;

&quot;We have email addresses and phone numbers.&quot; Onyx hissed. She pointed 
again to the injured soldiers and agents. &quot;This is uncalled for! There 
is no rhyme nor reason for such chaos.&quot;

Miyu stepped forward, ready to charge. &quot;We did not come here for a 
discussion.&quot;

The android was off in a flash, her body racing towards Onyx at top 
speed. Already suited up, Onyx dodged out of the way, blocking the 
weapon with her own. She leapt back and allowed Topaz to cover her for a 
moment. The chain mace swung out, forcing Miyu to dodge as Onyx pulled a 
device from her robe. Haruka opened fire on Ruby simply to prevent her 
from swarming the platinum haired warrior as well. Ruby naturally flew 
out of harms way and deflected all other bullets with a fire shield. 
Onyx slammed a button on the small, almost detonator-like device she was 
in possession of. In an instant, the HiME assault paused.

Miyu flung her head back and her eyes suddenly began to glow red, data 
code visible racing against her irises. She screamed, and it started out 
as the scream of a flesh and blood being, but descended into an 
electronic wail as her limbs returned to normal and began to convulse. 
The woman dropped to the ground, immobile, almost looking as if she were 
catatonic. The HiME around her paused in shock. What in the hell?

Onyx walked forward, dropping the device casually. &quot;We were informed by 
a respectable source that the Yggdrasil unit was actively helping the 
HiME. As such, our good Doctor gave us a handy little program to resolve 
the issue.&quot;

The Otome kicked the side of Miyu&#39;s face gently, only strong enough to 
move her onto her stomach and roll her to the side, allowing Onyx to 
continue forward without anything in her path. The grip on her pole-axe 
became frighteningly tight, and she lashed out in an instant, aiming 
right for Haruka. The blonde woman flung herself back and was pleased to 
see that the weapon was met by a similar one. Midori blocked the assault 
and struggled against what could arguably have been her &quot;VR HiME&quot; 
counterpart. Axe hit axe in a flurry of blows while everyone else 
scrambled to support.

Haruka turned her attention back to Topaz, firing twice and then dodging 
a wide horizontal attack from the chain mace. Natsuki had given up with 
her revolver for now, and attempted to do nothing less than pistol whip 
Ruby. The attack failed as Ruby ducked out of harms way and flew into 
the air, Elements spinning around her limbs. After reaching a height of 
one hundred feet she stopped and ignited her weapons, the glow 
noticeable from the parked vehicle waiting for the HiME.

Mai&#39;s jaw dropped after actually seeing her Elements in use with someone 
else. So, it was true after all. Losing sight of the woman after she 
dodged a shot from Natsuki&#39;s gun, Mai stepped out of the vehicle and 
walked a few paces towards the battle. Was this what she looked like 
during the Carnival? That erratic mass of anger, hate, and flame? It 
was... frightening. It was even more disturbing to see someone else 
wield powers she once held sacred and had once used for good.

Her movement did not go unnoticed. From her vantage point, Ruby saw the 
stunned redhead, and her eyes instantly snapped open while her lips 
curled into a snarl. Her overdose of Otome nanomachines fueled an 
unnatural burst of adrenaline. There... there was the woman she was 
compared to so incessantly. &quot;Tokiha!&quot;

Mai tensed, staring up at Ruby, nervous despite her sizable distance 
from the group. The sound of Ruby&#39;s voice harbored a great degree of 
rage and... perhaps pain? It was not the calling out of a simple enemy. 
This was true anger.

Haruka and Topaz paused in their fight to watch, just in case Ruby 
snapped again. Midori and Onyx, however, did not let up for a moment. 
Midori had a mission, after all &#150; to leave a gap in her armor. But the 
fire adept seemed content on showing them all up yet again. &quot;You&#39;re 
Tokiha? God, I hear about the great Queen of Heaven every day for the 
last five years, and this is what I find? The mistress of Kagutsuchi 
looks like nothing more than a pencil pushing, weak little woman.&quot;

Mai clenched her jaw. She hadn&#39;t the power to fight, but most certainly 
did not approve of such comments. She was not weak. Not anymore. Queen 
of Heaven? What was that about?

&quot;I keep hearing I&#39;m nothing more than an overpowered failure, and you 
can&#39;t even fight on your own. Absolutely pathetic. It&#39;s proof that the 
HiME are helpless women. I&#39;ll show you just how superior the Otome are,&quot; 
Ruby hissed. When it looked like she was about to break for Mai, both 
Haruka and Natsuki opened fire to stop her. It seemed to work. Ruby dove 
down near the ground and formed another shield of fire to stop any stray 
bullets. As a response, Ruby flung a fireball towards them both, and the 
gunners leapt to the side and out of the way.

&quot;You all right, Kuga?&quot; Haruka questioned after getting back to her feet. 
Natsuki nodded &#150; the only response that was necessary.

Midori&#39;s axe was locked against Onyx&#39;s, and she desperately pushed and 
shoved to get her off. The teacher kicked out and caught the Otome&#39;s 
knee. It wasn&#39;t effective in actually pushing her away, but it threw her 
off enough to where Midori could swing her weapon back and lash out. 
Onyx blocked two successive attacks, and leapt out of the way of a 
third. She gritted her teeth. This woman... was good. Onyx attempted to 
swipe Midori&#39;s legs out from under her, but the teacher leapt over the 
shaft of the pole-axe before it could hit. And as Onyx recovered from 
her attempted hit, the teacher bashed her in the side of the head with 
the bottom of her weapon.

Onyx grunted and then screamed as Midori&#39;s weapon came down blade first 
on her robe. The weapon came down so swift, and Midori&#39;s blade had been 
sharpened so much, that a small gap of perhaps two inches across was 
formed from the impact. The force she had used to land her decisive 
strike caused her to fall forward, and both she an Onyx crashed to the 
ground. Haruka moved in to cover Midori while she got up, and she 
shouted out to Natsuki.

&quot;Delinquent! Now!&quot;

Already on top of things, Natsuki ripped the transmitter from her 
bandolier and loaded it into her empty revolver. Spinning the chamber, 
she locked it into place and pulled back the hammer, lowering herself to 
one knee and bracing her firing arm against the opposing one for 
support. She wasn&#39;t a sharpshooter, and with the gap so small... She 
steadied herself, ignoring both Topaz and Ruby brawling with the others. 
She fixed her eyes on the pale flesh of Onyx&#39;s exposed leg, and lined 
her gun up gently. She only had one shot...

She squeezed the trigger with the utmost care and sensitivity, and felt 
the gun kick back after the bullet was released. She slowly opened her 
eyes, afraid that she had missed. Instead, she was greeted with the 
sight of Onyx clutching onto her leg, stifling a scream. She wasn&#39;t able 
to for long. Her voice echoed through the area as she let out an almost 
blood curdling yell of pain, blood pouring from the open wound. Onyx 
began to retreat, barely able to move. Topaz immediately stopped her 
assault against Midori and Haruka to assist, Ruby giving them cover.

&quot;I&#39;m fine!&quot; Onyx demanded as Topaz manhandled her back towards the APC 
in retreat. &quot;Get back over there and deal with them.&quot;

&quot;Or not,&quot; Topaz countered. Leaving her leader as a sitting duck was not 
an option. So with one of Onyx&#39;s arms around her neck, she rapidly 
retreated to the APC and began to load her teammate in. Ruby was behind, 
summoning up a wall of fire to keep the HiME at bay. While she truly 
wished to go after Tokiha to see if she could fight at all, she knew 
full well that Onyx&#39;s safety came first. And so, against Onyx&#39;s actual 
orders, Topaz took over and issued a retreat in order to tend to her 
wounds, cursing that they did not send out all five Columns to deal with 
this.

A string of flame whipped out across the battlefield, the HiME ducking 
and leaping out of the way. Haruka winced as she felt a sting on her 
arm, and looked down to see a light burn wound. She&#39;d been too slow, but 
it was all right. It was only a minor wound. Ruby, all at once, banished 
her deadly fires and retreated into the APC as well. It raced off, and 
the HiME did not pursue. Onyx looked back and out the window, feeling 
uneasy. That was... too odd an encounter. She turned her gaze to her 
leg, but could not fix her eyes on it for long before she had to turn 
away. Looking at it made the pain worse, and she had not yet mastered 
ignoring physical injuries. In time.

Midori fell to Miyu&#39;s side, and examined her. The android was entirely 
immobile. Her eyes were &#39;dead&#39; in the sense that they looked offline. 
She turned back to Haruka and Natsuki. &quot;Virus or something?&quot;

Both shrugged. Natsuki offered an answer. &quot;Alyssa is supposed to be good 
with gadgets. Maybe she knows how to fix her. Either that, or Yukino.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;ll have to do,&quot; Midori agreed. &quot;Haruka, help me carry her back to 
the car.&quot;

&quot;Let the delinquent do the manual labor. I&#39;ll go tell Mai to warm up the 
truck.&quot; Haruka pivoted around, leaving Natsuki to holster her weapons 
and bend to pick up the platinum haired warrior.

Midori shook her head. Of course, pretty princess, no peasant work for 
you!

The teacher and the biker did the job of carrying the android back 
towards the SUV that Mai was climbing back into. She was heavier than 
she looked.

- - -

Natsuki&#39;s bike came to a stop just outside Miyu&#39;s home, and she left it 
running while she headed up to get the golden haired youth inside. Mai 
had dispatched her to fetch the girl after returning to her apartment. 
The biker hopped up the steps and rapidly knocked on the door. Damn 
broken robots. This could only have happened to them. Without even 
wasting time removing her helmet, Natsuki opened the door before Alyssa 
could even get there, seeing the girl walk down the stairs. Alyssa 
paused, not expecting Natsuki, but didn&#39;t have much time before the 
biker stated what the problem was.

&quot;Miyu was damaged and infected by some kind of virus. She&#39;s offline. 
She&#39;s at Mai&#39;s apartment. I&#39;ll take you over there. Do you think you can 
fix her?&quot; Natsuki inquired.

Alyssa&#39;s gazed instantly hardened. &quot;Miyu...?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Natsuki said, not knowing what else to say. &quot;Her body&#39;s 
fine. It&#39;s just that we can&#39;t get her back online.&quot;

The blonde closed her icy blue eyes for a moment, fearing what happened 
to the one person who truly was like an elder sister or a mother, and 
then headed back upstairs. &quot;I have to get some things. Wait here. I&#39;ll 
be right back.&quot;

It didn&#39;t take long for Alyssa to return with a bag of hastily thrown 
together gadgets and memory cards. Natsuki led her back out to the bike, 
noting the girl&#39;s distressed expression. She felt herself torn. Should 
she hug her? Tell her everything was okay? Alyssa, however, seemed to be 
much like Natsuki when it came to important things. She got on the back 
seat without missing a beat, leaving Natsuki to climb on. The biker sat 
herself down on the main seat and prepared to leave, but remembered one 
thing.

She slid off her own helmet and gave it to Alyssa, who fastened it to 
her head. &quot;Hang on.&quot;

A ten minute silent ride later, Miyu was sitting upright, though still 
offline, with her back opened up to reveal a host of electronic 
thingamajigs that only the technical people seemed to understand. Alyssa 
had, apparently, kept a great deal of Miyu&#39;s data backed up on various 
discs and memory cards. The problem lay in doing away with what looked 
liked fried circuitry and some important software gone corrupt from 
whatever Onyx had activated. Alyssa was a bit vexed, but talking while 
she worked to keep her mind occupied. Yukino was at her side, helping in 
whatever way she could.

Shizuru came in from MHI&#39;s fairly new Kyoto complex with a few more 
electronic thingamajigs that no one but them seemed to be impressed by. 
Shizuru handed over the small box to Alyssa and said, &quot;They aren&#39;t your 
exact specifications, as Searrs uses its own equipment, but should work 
in a pinch. How are things progressing?&quot;

Alyssa looked up, took the box, and got back to work immediately after 
examining them, typing onto panels and using a few tools to pry open 
busted parts. She looked like a little blonde Natsuki working on a 
motorcycle. &quot;I think they&#39;ll be all right. Thank you, Shizuru-sama. How 
did you get them away from work with no problems?&quot;

&quot;Ara, I stole them.&quot; Shizuru&#39;s words were blunt, but honest. Natsuki 
sighed at her girlfriend&#39;s actions as Alyssa looked back up in mild 
surprise. Shizuru shrugged. &quot;You don&#39;t have to address me as 
Shizuru-sama, either. No suffix is needed.&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; Alyssa replied, and set back to work. Shizuru looked over 
her shoulder, monitoring the progress with Yukino, both elder women 
surprised by her skills and keeping watch should she need aid. Not that 
it looked like it at this point.

Shizuru gazed at the electronics and, summoning up what experience in 
the technical field she had, asked, &quot;Have you been locked out of her 
operating system, then? And even the BIOS isn&#39;t cooperating?&quot;

&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Alyssa replied. &quot;Seems to have been the work of Dr. 
Smith. He was on the Yggdrasil team. I guess it makes sense for that 
corrupt fool to be involved with the Otome.&quot;

Natsuki looked down. Did she know of her own parentage? A private 
discussion. Best not to bring it up there. &quot;Smith? You think he&#39;s in 
charge of it all?&quot;

&quot;Maybe. Shizuru, will you hand me that?&quot; Alyssa asked, looked at a tool 
next to her. The Kyoto woman obliged and handed it over, the pair 
seemingly teaming up to deal with Miyu&#39;s little software breakdown. 
Yukino was busy trying to hack through whatever Smith had installed. But 
it was taking time. The code was unlike anything she&#39;d seen.

&quot;How long until you think Miyu will be fixed?&quot; Midori asked.

Yukino shook her head. &quot;Too difficult to say. Could be hours, could be 
days. I wouldn&#39;t expect to have her for your final showdown.&quot;

Alyssa seemed to agree, nodding along. Mai sighed. They didn&#39;t have that 
long. The Emulator could be moved by then. &quot;Were you able to track down 
the Otome after Natsuki implanted the transmitter?&quot;

&quot;They seemed to stick to three main areas. I have them marked down,&quot; 
Yukino replied, handing over a map of the facility. &quot;If you want to 
start the endgame, now would be the time to do it. We won&#39;t get more 
exact than that.&quot;

Mai nodded. &quot;Well... it&#39;s a shame Miyu won&#39;t be here to help us, but I 
think it&#39;ll be better to push forward rather than wait for a repair that 
could take days. We should break into teams and plan to assault the 
facility tomorrow night. Does that sound good to all of you?&quot;

A series of nods. Even from Akane, who was still greatly disturbed by 
the prospect of being responsible for Sister&#39;s true death. Mai, once 
again comfortable in a leader mode and Natsuki letting her take the 
unofficial rank, looked to each of them and continued her unplanned 
briefing of what might have been a suicide mission.

&quot;We&#39;ve got a couple objectives to complete. The main power supply needs 
to be destroyed. Someone needs to secure the real Emulator in case we 
have to demolish it, which means you need to be calm enough to handle... 
the guilt involved with that. The computer networks and data need to be 
destroyed. Some of us will have to keep the Otome and their fellow 
soldiers at bay. If Smith is involved, he needs to be dealt with. Who 
wants to do what?&quot; Mai asked.

One by one, they picked a task. Even Haruka was going along, far too 
involved now to &#39;let the other nitwits try and deal with things.&#39; Their 
real jobs be damned, they each prepared themselves for a final push 
against Searrs. Midori would get the main power supply. Shizuru and 
Natsuki would deal with the Emulator, only those two having the will to 
perform the most heinous of attacks. Nao would deal with the wanton 
destruction of the computer system, Yukino agreeing to remotely hack in 
and delete key files. Smith would be &#39;dealt with&#39; by either Midori or 
Natsuki. Everyone else was on Otome duty.

&quot;And...&quot; Mai began, &quot;since the Emulator tends to overload if it has to 
deal with too many people using it at once... I suggest that we try and 
materialize our own weapons and Children. I don&#39;t know if it will work, 
but if we can overload the system, the Otome will be defenseless &#150; more 
than us, I&#39;m willing to bet.&quot;

&quot;Right!&quot; Midori cheered. &quot;Then we can really show them just how much 
HiMEs are superior. Have to take them off their high horses.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Natsuki said, &quot;time for this thing to end.&quot;

All ten HiMEs in the room nodded in agreement. It was about damned time.

- - -

Next Episode: The finale. The HiME storm the Searrs facility, and the 
Otome are out in full force to try and stop them. Can anyone tap into 
the Emulator and materialize their Elements, or will the Otome remain 
the sole users of the artificial system? The Otome on one side, the HiME 
on the other, but only one group will claim victory &#150; the potential 
sacrifice of Sister always an imminent threat.

Note: Epilogue will follow, and possibly a just-for-fun appendix 
mimicking a Searrs report on the older Carnivals and stuff. Yukariko 
being the Shinso was alluded to in earlier chapters with the Emulator&#39;s 
&#39;booting up&#39; like in Otome, with the phrase &#39;connected to S.Y.&#39; Those 
being her initials, of course.</pre>
