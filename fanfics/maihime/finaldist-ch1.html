<strong>Story Notes:</strong>
<p>1. This piece takes place between the graduation day of Natsuki  Kruger and the beginning of the Mai-Otome series, detailing the lives  of both Kruger and Shizuru Viola during that time. There will be  flashbacks from time to time for background information as well.</p>
<p>2.  I will probably be taking aspects from the anime and the manga series  along with my own twist to things, so inevitably inconsistencies with  the original concept of Mai-Otome are going to occur.</p>
<p>3. There’s  no guarantee as to how this is going to turn out. I don’t know how long  it’s going to be, or if it’ll even be completed. That partially depends  on myself, you the readers, and whether or not it begins to hinder the  progress of my other story. Just a fair warning.</p>

<strong></strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">
<p>Graduation was <em>nearly</em> as flawless as it was every year at Garderobe Academy.</p>
<p>Headmistress  Lucretia Oleander delivered her congratulatory speech to the graduating  Pearls and expressed her utmost confidence in the rising Corals. Wave  after wave of young girl’s walked across the stage receiving either new  GEMs or a piece of paper proving to the world that they had  successfully completed the difficult Garderobe curriculum, some even  receiving awards for their efforts in the various classes the school  offered.</p>
<p>The only slight hitch came when it was time to announce  the top Pearl, only for her to not rise and accept the praise she had  dutifully earned.</p>
<p>Throughout the extravagant ceremony so full of  beaming faces, something she had been working so hard for these past  years, Natsuki wasn’t able to focus in the least. In fact, she wasn’t  even aware that her name had been called to retrieve her own diploma  until Laura had promptly delivered a startling elbow shot to her ribs.</p>
<p>It  wasn’t until after graduation had ended and the after-party, which was  far too formal for Natsuki’s taste, had begun that the dark-haired girl  was requested in the Gakuenchou’s office. The other girl’s had looked  at Natsuki with great concern when Miss Maria had solemnly informed the  quiet girl and led her away, and she was unable to give her classmates  any reassurance as she disappeared through the giant doors of the  dancehall to face the unknown.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Lucretia  Oleander sat at her desk, gnawing away on her bottom lip like she had  her entire life when she was worried. And now, at the graceful age of  thirty-eight, she was indeed <em>worried</em>, which only caused her to slip into her old habit. Luckily though, an appropriately placed hand hid this act quite nicely.
<p>The  woman’s deep blue eyes watched unwavering as Miss Maria walked through  the door of her office, an obviously distressed Natsuki Kruger trailing  a few steps behind. Once the older woman had left the two alone, the  Gakuenchou took a moment to glance over her number two Pearl.</p>
<p>Kruger  had come from the turbulent land of Vedel, a place that was constantly  in a state of civil war, and thankfully quite a distance away from  Garderobe. Vedel generally didn’t care to send any of its young women  to the school, Natsuki actually being the first under the request of  her mother, Saeko Kruger, a politician whom had taken over the  resistance against the corrupt royalty who currently ruled the country  after her husband had been killed in battle.</p>
<p>When asked why she wished to attend, the emerald-eyed girl would answer, without hesitation, that it was <em>“To become strong enough to help my country.”</em> And Natsuki had worked hard; there was no doubt about that. Lucretia  had to admit that she had a level of respect for the determined girl,  but at the same time, she was uncomfortable with the serious aura that  Kruger tended to exude, almost as if the future of her homeland had  been fully set upon her young shoulders. The heavy responsibility was  certainly there, it was painfully present in those striking jade orbs,  but at the same time, the girl put up a strong, impenetrable exterior  to shield herself from it, and inevitably, anyone who tried to help  ease her burden.</p>
<p>There were only a handful of people Natsuki  seemed to even consider trustworthy at the school, one of which  Lucretia had brought her here to question about, and with a sigh, she  reluctantly began her interrogation.</p>
<p>“I noticed that your roommate, Mai Tokiha, wasn’t present at today’s ceremony…”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am. That’s correct.”</p>
<p>“Would you happen to know <em>why</em> she didn’t attend?”</p>
<p>Natsuki  squinted at the older woman’s words, unconsciously thumbing the small  piece of paper in her hands that were hidden behind her back as she  thought about the words Mai had left in her letter.</p>
<p><em>Dear Natsuki,</em></p>
<p><em>Forgive  me for being so sudden, but I just can’t go through with the graduation  ceremony. Right now, I’m not ready to make that kind of decision before  I can sort out all of my thoughts and feelings. Becoming an Otome,  especially a Column, is a serious matter, you taught me that more than  anyone, Natsuki, and I don’t want to disrespect you and the other girls  who have worked so hard to get to this point. That’s why I’m leaving,  to take some time to discover myself before I finally decide. Please,  don’t be too upset with me, and I hope my actions do not cause you too  much trouble (I’m sure you’ll get me back later if I do). Once I’ve  made my decision, you will definitely be the first to know, I promise!  Until then, take care, Natsuki.</em></p>
<p><em>Love,</em></p>
<p><em>Mai Tokiha</em></p>
<p><em>PS: Congratulations on graduating! Despite the numbers, we all know you’re the best Otome!</em></p>
<p>“Well, Natsuki?” the Headmistress pressed at the lack of response, which caused the girl in question to jump.</p>
<p>“S-Sorry, Gakuenchou. I…I…”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Walking  up to Oleander-sama’s desk, Natsuki silently placed the note on the  dark oak wood, and once the principal had read over it thoroughly, she  released an unhappy sigh as she combed her fingers through her  shoulder-length rust colored hair.</p>
<p>“So it was more serious than I  thought,” the woman mumbled to herself before turning back to the girl  standing in front of her, “And she didn’t tell you anything? Where she  was going?”</p>
<p>“N-No, ma’am…” Natsuki dejectedly informed her.</p>
<p>“I see...Do you have <em>any</em> clue as to where Tokiha-san might have gone?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid not, ma’am.”</p>
<p>Folding  the piece of paper back over, Lucretia stood and walked around her desk  to stand beside her raven-haired pupil and handed her the note, which  Natsuki swiftly returned to the sash of her uniform.</p>
<p>“You’re friend was to become the newest member of the Five Columns, you know?”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am. Mai told me of your decision.”</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> were a candidate for the position as well, Miss Kruger.”</p>
<p>The girl’s eyes immediately widened, “G-Gakue—“</p>
<p>“Ah,  forgive me. Tonight is your graduation party, and I don’t mean to keep  you from it,” the woman suddenly proclaimed, placing her hands on  Natsuki’s shoulders, “Congratulations, Natsuki. I’m very proud of you.”</p>
<p>“Th-Thank you, Headmistress.”</p>
<p>Once  the woman had removed herself and started back to her desk, Natsuki  made to leave before the principal suddenly called out to her and  hesitatingly waved her over. With a baffled expression, the girl  complied and watched as Oleander-sama removed an envelope from her  desk, staring at the thing thoughtfully, almost as if she was arguing  with herself over what to do with it, before she slowly stretch her arm  out to Natsuki who carefully took the envelope in her hands.</p>
<p>“<em>Read that in the morning,”</em> the Headmistress had instructed her before she left the room, but upon  setting her eyes on the emblem of Vedel accompanied by her family crest  printed on the envelope, Natsuki wasted no time in ripping the letter  open.</p>
