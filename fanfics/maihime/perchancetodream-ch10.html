<a href="../maihime/perchancetodream-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><p>Living the Dream</p><p>X-X-X</p><p><i>Ara ara... I think I broke 
Natsuki...</i></p><p>Shizuru smiled at the “broken” form of her lover lying on the bed 
beneath her and gave her a quick kiss in apology. Natsuki was utterly worn out now, without 
even the energy to keep her arms wrapped around Shizuru. The sight of Natsuki like this made 
her heart ache in her chest. She was completely vulnerable and relaxed in Shizuru's 
presence. She'd given herself over completely to her lover. She was even blushing throughout 
her body, just so Shizuru could enjoy the sight all the more. <i>Well maybe not entirely for 
that reason, but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.</i></p><p>Inspecting Natsuki's 
reddened body was starting to stir things up within Shizuru. That certainly wasn't good 
right now. Natsuki was far too worn out to take anymore, and yet she was still far too 
alluring for Shizuru to stand. She was cute, too – she always was when she slept. Perhaps 
Shizuru could focus on that. Focus on how her blush made her look adorable. Cute reddened 
cheeks, with just a little glint on them from the tears she'd squeezed out during her – 
<i>No! Don't think about that!</i></p><p>“Ara... I just can't seem to control myself around 
you, Natsuki,” Shizuru said to her snoozing lover. “Though I guess you know that very well 
by now. Even so, I can't help but want to do more for you, to make you feel the touch of 
heaven a million times, all in thanks for loving me.” Shizuru brushed a lock of Natsuki's 
hair off of her face and gave her forehead a kiss. “Rest well for now, Natsuki. I'll go and 
make us something to eat, because I simply can't trust myself in your presence a moment 
longer. Love you.”</p><p>The message seemed to get through to Natsuki on some level, as she 
murmured back something that fell somewhere between “Love you” and “Zuru.” Shizuru giggled 
at this and planted another kiss on her love's forehead. She looked around the room briefly 
until she found the pillow she'd given Natsuki to cuddle with while she slept. She passed 
the pillow to the still-sleeping girl on the bed, who reacted by rolling over so that she 
could throw an arm on top of it, so that she could hug it with minimal effort. Shizuru 
couldn't help but giggle again at her girlfriend's adorable behavior as she pulled the 
bedsheets over Natsuki.</p><p>Shizuru picked up her discarded clothes from the floor and got 
redressed. They were pretty wrinkled by this point, but they would be good enough for just 
around the apartment. After this it was a fight, but eventually Shizuru was able to tear 
herself away from the image of Natsuki cuddling with her pillow while she rested. She paused 
as she closed the bedroom door behind her, so that she could take a breath and clear her 
head.</p><p>It was only once she did this that Shizuru realized just how muddied her head 
had been in the presence of Natsuki. <i>Or perhaps “muddied” isn't the best word... 
“preoccupied,” maybe? Or maybe simply “in love” describes it well enough.</i></p><p>Shizuru 
let out a sigh as she started to drift to the kitchen. Life was good. She was finally able 
to accept that simple fact. It was a wonder that it had eluded her for so long. She had been 
able to accept that she was with Natsuki since the week before – Natsuki had made that quite 
impossible to deny – but she'd been walking through her life as if it were a dream she might 
wake up from at any moment. She'd finally woken up, but she'd woken up to the fact that this 
was indeed her life now.</p><p>Shizuru found herself humming a tune to herself as she 
searched through Natsuki's cupboards for something suitable for breakfast. She was infected 
with love, there was no denying it. There was also no denying that Natsuki had horrible 
eating habits, once Shizuru saw what she kept stocked. She'd have to work on convincing her 
girlfriend to keep some healthier foods around so that she could have a proper meal once in 
a while. Of course, Natsuki would insist that it was all fine as long as she exercised it 
off, and that would give Shizuru the opening to request that her girlfriend at least stock 
it for when Shizuru was over and wanted a bite to eat. <i>“Doesn't Natsuki care about her 
girlfriend?” with a sniffle for good measure. Perfect, Natsuki will love it!</i></p><p>It 
took until the last cupboard she opened, but eventually Shizuru found something that 
appealed to her, even if it wasn't food. With a grin, she pulled the box of teabags out of 
the cupboard, reminding herself to thank Natsuki later for the thought. A flash of white 
from the cupboard caught her eye just as the box was removed, and Shizuru looked up to find 
a note where the box had been.</p><p><i>Shame on you for snooping, Shizuru! I knew I 
wouldn't be able to trust you around my dorm room unsupervised. You now owe me a sandwich 
slathered in mayo if you want my forgiveness.</i></p><p><i>Oh, and I hope you enjoy the 
tea... Not sure where you usually get tea leaves to make it properly, so I did the best I 
could.</i></p><p>Shizuru had to restrain a whimper at this. Even when she was asleep in the 
other room, Natsuki wouldn't let up with her cute attacks. Well, if that was what Natsuki 
was willing to do for mayo, Shizuru wasn't one to disappoint. She grabbed a loaf of bread 
out of the cupboard and went to the fridge for some mayo and something a bit healthier. Of 
course, with how Natsuki stocked her kitchen, the best Shizuru could come up with a ham, 
swiss, and mayo sandwich. She'd just have to be sure to help Natsuki work off the fat later, 
hopefully in a very enjoyable manner.</p><p>Once the sandwich was ready, Shizuru microwaved 
herself up a cup of tea and went in to check on Natsuki. She'd rolled over now, so Shizuru 
could see a cute smile on her face, which of course ended up being infectious. Blowing a 
quick kiss to her love, Shizuru left her to rest while she went to enjoy her tea, and 
possibly also to snoop around a bit more and find out how Natsuki liked to pass her 
time.</p><p>X-X-X</p><p>“Good morning, sleepyhead.”</p><p>“Gah!” Natsuki jolted, as Shizuru 
caught her out sneaking up behind her. “How do you do that? I barely made a 
noise!”</p><p>“Ara...” Shizuru grinned as she turned her chair around so that she could face 
her lover. “I could never miss even the slightest sound from my Natsuki. How could she 
expect any less from me?”</p><p>“Hmph!” Natsuki said with a pout. She turned off to the side 
as she said, “Well I was going to surprise you with a hug, but I guess I won't 
now...”</p><p>Shizuru smirked at this. So Natsuki thought she could tease her, did she? She 
really should know better by now. Or perhaps she was doing this deliberately to provoke 
Shizuru into teasing her back. Well, far be it for Shizuru to disappoint. “Ara, then I guess 
I won't be able to surprise Natsuki with the special mayo sandwich I prepared for 
her...”</p><p>“M-m-mayo?” At just that one word, Natsuki broke down into what Shizuru liked 
to call “cute mode.” “You... you made me lunch?”</p><p>“Well, I was planning for it to be 
breakfast,” Shizuru said, “but I guess it is closer to lunch now. However, if Natsuki no 
longer wishes to supply me with a hug, the most basic show of affection, then I guess I'll 
have to go and dispose of it...”</p><p>“NO!!” Natsuki snapped in panic. It took her a 
moment, but she regained control of herself. “I mean, no, you don't have to. Here...” 
Natsuki approached Shizuru and bent down to give her a hug. She gave her girlfriend a loving 
squeeze, and then topped it off with a kiss on her cheek. “There. So you know I'm not just 
doing this for mayo.”</p><p>Shizuru brought a hand up to her cheek to cover the rising 
blush. “Ara, but then how will I tease Natsuki about it?”</p><p>Natsuki glared at Shizuru 
for a moment. “You'll live,” she said, before turning off to head towards the 
kitchen.</p><p>Shizuru got up to follow Natsuki. “But Natsuki needs a high dose of teasing 
to keep her in 'cute mode'...”</p><p>Natsuki turned back to glare at Shizuru again as she 
reached the table. “I can do that just fine on my own, thank you very much. And I prefer to 
call it 'girlfriend mode.'”</p><p>Shizuru had to pause in her step as Natsuki's words hit 
her. They came out so easily, and they so casually professed both their new relationship and 
how Natsuki felt about it. An image flashed through Shizuru's mind of Natsuki boldly 
declaring their relationship to their friends: “Yeah, I have a girlfriend. What of it?” 
<i>Ahh... so sweet...</i></p><p>Finding the box of teabags again so that she could make 
herself another cup while Natsuki had her lunch, Shizuru decided that with that comment 
Natsuki had earned herself a special tease in thanks.</p><p>“Well how about we compromise 
then? We can call it 'puppy mode.'”</p><p>“What? No!” Natsuki protested, the shock of this 
statement even making her lose sight of her mayo sandwich. “That one's even worse! How is 
that a compromise?”</p><p>“Ara... well if Natsuki thinks that one is worse, then I guess we 
can go with 'cute mode.'” Shizuru placed her teacup in the microwave as she watched Natsuki 
out of the corner of her eye. Such a beautiful blush she had. And she was enjoying this too, 
Shizuru was sure now. <i>Such a precious girl... I truly don't deserve her.</i></p><p>“Oh 
no, you don't!”</p><p>Shizuru gave Natsuki an impish half-grin. “Well, if we call it 
'girlfriend mode,' can I at least call Natsuki my puppy?”</p><p>Natsuki paused for a second, 
blinking rapidly. “What? ...Fine, whatever, but that's not what I meant. You sighed! I saw 
it!”</p><p>It was Shizuru's turn to pause as she was about to start the microwave. “Ara? 
What does Natsuki mean?”</p><p>“Don't you 'Ara' me!” Natsuki pressed up against Shizuru, 
allowing her to see the emotion in Natsuki's eyes. She was frustrated now, certainly, but 
there was also a deep concern and sadness in her expression. “You have to stop doing this, 
Shizuru!”</p><p>“Doing what, Natsuki?”</p><p>“Sighing like that!” Natsuki said. It almost 
looked like she was trembling as she said this. “Feeling guilt, like you don't deserve this. 
Do you have any idea how that makes me feel?”</p><p>“Natsuki... I...” Shizuru's mind blanked 
as she stumbled for the words. She'd thought she'd already been able to get over this, at 
least well enough, but she still fell into that same trap of feeling like she didn't deserve 
Natsuki. But was it really so bad to feel that way? “You really don't need to worry about 
me. I'll probably always feel like Natsuki is too good to be true. Isn't that just a part of 
being in love?”</p><p>Natsuki stared at Shizuru for a few seconds, her features slowly 
softening. “I don't know. Maybe. I just don't want you to feel any more guilt...” Natsuki 
looked down, gritting her teeth for a moment. “Sorry, Shizuru... maybe this is my fault. I 
haven't been able to use the last couple of coupons yet, and I keep worrying that you'll 
feel guilty about your past until I do.”</p><p>“Natsuki...” Shizuru placed a finger below 
Natsuki's chin, pulling her face up. She leaned down to place a gentle kiss on Natsuki's 
lips, hoping that it would help calm her doubts. It always worked when Natsuki kissed her 
like that, certainly. “Please... don't worry. I'm fine now. What you did for me today helped 
me finally accept that this is my life now, and although I may be ecstatic about it and feel 
like it's too good to be true, I know it is.”</p><p>Natsuki stood stunned for a moment from 
the kiss, her face slowly softening into a small smile. “I helped you...? But... what did I 
do?”</p><p>Shizuru smiled down at her girlfriend, and she had to resist the urge to kiss her 
again – at least for the time being. “It was reading Natsuki's journal that did it. I felt 
like I was living a dream until today, but the realization that Natsuki was having her own 
troubles and everything wasn't perfect made it all clear to me. This was my life, troubles 
and all. I admit, I probably didn't react to that with my usual composure, but I don't think 
Natsuki would argue I was upset with the realization.”</p><p>Natsuki's face slowly turned a 
lovely shade of red, until it was simply impossible for Shizuru to resist kissing her any 
longer. Of course, doing this only made her blush more. She backed off from the source of 
her torment and tried to cough out the blush. Fortunately for Shizuru, it didn't work. 
“Um...well, I have to say, you did kind of help me with my fears as well...” Natsuki's face 
shot through to purple now. “My dreams just then were... not... so bad...”</p><p>A huge grin 
tugged at Shizuru's lips as she heard this. Natsuki was blushing this badly, and handing her 
even more teasing fodder? Such a sweet gift couldn't be turned down. “Ara...? Natsuki was 
having naughty dreams about me?”</p><p>It was just unfortunate that Natsuki's blush was 
already at maximum, but she did still seem to become cuter by the moment. “It's your 
fault...” she mumbled. “You're the one that makes me feel that way...”</p><p><i>Too cute! 
Can't resist...!</i> Shizuru bounded forward and grabbed Natsuki in her arms, hugging as if 
her life depended on it. Natsuki nuzzled into Shizuru's neck when they came together, 
causing Shizuru to let out an unconscious whimper of delight. “Good puppy... Love you, 
'suki...”</p><p>“Yeah...” Natsuki said. She planted a quick kiss on Shizuru's neck. “You 
too... Zuru.” Natsuki reluctantly pulled back from the hug, revealing that she'd mostly 
recovered from her blush attack by now. “Can I have my mayo now, or are you going to torment 
me some more?”</p><p>Shizuru could have used this as the impetus for more teasing, but she 
decided it was time for a more important lesson now. “I'll tell you what, Natsuki,” she 
said, unable to keep an impish smile from forming on her face. “If you can look me in the 
eyes and tell me I'm teasing you too much, I'll leave you alone.” Shizuru certainly wasn't 
planning to let Natsuki forget that she'd finally admitted to enjoying her teasing. Of 
course, that didn't mean she'd be letting up. Quite the opposite, even.</p><p>Natsuki froze 
solid when Shizuru said this. It took many long minutes before she thawed, shaking nervously 
as she tried to look Shizuru in the eyes. Shizuru tried to keep a straight face as Natsuki's 
mouth opened and closed, her face periodically twitching. Eventually she surrendered, 
letting out a defeated sigh. “...You're evil, you know that? I'm getting my sandwich. 
Revenge later.”</p><p>Shizuru didn't bother to stifle her laughter at Natsuki's reaction, 
knowing full well it would just make her blush. “Evil, perhaps. But I do want Natsuki to 
know that she can get me to stop anytime she wants. Hopefully that knowledge will make her 
blush even more when she doesn't ask me to stop.”</p><p>Natsuki glared back at Shizuru as 
she sat down at the table. “Drink your tea woman, and make me another sandwich. I need to 
think up appropriate revenge for you.”</p><p><i>And the revenge is another delicious 
benefit.</i> “Ara, yes Natsuki-sama.”</p><p>X-X-X</p><p>“Gotcha!”</p><p>“Ah-haha...” Shizuru 
burst into laughter as Natsuki tackled her onto the couch. “Did Natsuki finally think up her 
revenge?”</p><p>“Quiet!” Natsuki grabbed Shizuru's hands and held them down to her side. 
Once her hands were secure she rolled Shizuru over onto her back and leaned down on her. The 
sound of the television vanished as Natsuki grabbed the remote to shut it off. “I may not be 
able to sneak up on you,” she said. “But I can still surprise you. Any last 
words?”</p><p>Shizuru didn't bother to hide her smile, as she knew Natsuki couldn't see it 
from her position. But she kept her tone of voice appropriate as she played along. “No, 
Natsuki-sama. You have captured me, and I am powerless to stop you from molesting me as you 
please. I know that I deserve it.”</p><p>“Damn right you deserve it,” Natsuki said. She 
grabbed Shizuru's wrists together with one hand and shifted off to the side, hopefully to 
free up more access to Shizuru's body. Shizuru's hopes were confirmed as she felt Natsuki's 
free hand creeping down her back, covering her rear and giving it a squeeze. Natsuki was 
surprisingly gentle, given her dominant position and behavior, but Shizuru certainly wasn't 
complaining.</p><p>Shizuru let her eyes drift shut as Natsuki massaged her rear. She could 
feel a pleasant warmth starting to spread through her at this treatment, and she let out a 
moan. “Suki...”</p><p>Natsuki leaned down to plant a kiss on the back of Shizuru's neck, 
which felt almost feather-light through her hair. Natsuki's warm breath then met with 
Shizuru's ear, and she whispered, “I've decided on your punishment Shizuru, and here it 
is...” A warmth burst up within Shizuru's chest as she heard this, hoping that Natsuki had 
something truly kinky in mind. “Two weeks, no tea.”</p><p>Those four words snapped Shizuru 
out of her lustful haze in an instant. She turned her head to look up at Natsuki as best she 
could and said, “Ara, Natsuki, that's not fair...”</p><p>“I think it's quite fair, given the 
magnitude of what you got out of me,” Natsuki said. Her voice betrayed no hint that she 
might be joking. Shizuru tried to plead with sad eyes, but they were roundly ignored. “You 
should consider yourself lucky even. After your two weeks are up you're in the clear, but 
you'll still have my admission over me. I'm being more merciful than you 
deserve.”</p><p>“But... Natsuki... Puppy...” Shizuru could already feel the pangs of 
withdrawal starting to hit her, just from the thought. Natsuki wouldn't really do this to 
her, would she?</p><p>“Shizuru, listen carefully to me...” Natsuki said. Her voice was thick 
and heavy, right next to Shizuru's ear. Shizuru couldn't help but focus on it as Natsuki 
continued, perfectly calmly: “Just kidding.”</p><p>Shizuru's face was red in a second. She'd 
fallen for Natsuki's tease, hook, line, and sinker. Natsuki had been able to make her blush 
before, certainly, but that was always through being surprisingly sweet, or just in making 
love. This was the first time Natsuki had landed a successful tease. Was this how Natsuki 
felt when Shizuru did it to her? She could see how Natsuki would certainly have a love-hate 
relationship with it.</p><p>The weight of Natsuki on top of Shizuru disappeared, but Shizuru 
wasn't paying it much mind. She was more focused on the good feelings this tease brought up 
within her. It certainly showed to her that Natsuki really cared about her to do this, which 
was quite touching. It also made her feel more vulnerable, softer. That was definitely 
something good to inflict on Natsuki, to help break through her rough exterior. Natsuki may 
have won this round, but Shizuru was as determined as ever to keep up her assaults on 
Natsuki. Such a sweet girl deserved nothing less.</p><p>A flash of light pulled Shizuru out 
of her thoughts, and she looked up to find that Natsuki had climbed back on top of her and 
snapped a picture. Natsuki grinned victoriously as she checked the picture. “Ah, perfect. 
You've really got quite the adorable blush, Shizuru.”</p><p>Shizuru pouted at this. “Did 
Natsuki really need to take a picture? She can make me blush anytime just by being sweet to 
me...”</p><p>“Hey, I may never pull this off again!” Natsuki protested. She shut the camera 
off and placed it on the table, giving Shizuru a smirk. “Let me have something to 
commemorate my victory.”</p><p>“Mmm... alright, Natsuki,” Shizuru said. She was able to find 
enough room under Natsuki so that she could roll over and look up at her girlfriend, now 
that she wasn't being forcibly pinned down. “But you can be sure that I'll be expecting my 
own souvenirs from my own victories.”</p><p>Natsuki narrowed her eyes, glaring down at 
Shizuru. “I'm not sure it's the best idea to promise revenge when I have you in such a 
compromising position, love.”</p><p>Natsuki's tone of voice was just what Shizuru needed to 
reignite the spark of lust within her. Was Natsuki hinting at something fun now? She'd given 
Shizuru just enough earlier that she was starting to ache for more – at least now that her 
tease was over. Shizuru looked up at Natsuki, giving her best “trapped puppy” eyes as she 
said, “Is Natsuki-sama going to molest me again? She has access to even more intimate parts 
this time...”</p><p>“Hrm...” Natsuki seemed to consider this as she traced her hands over 
Shizuru's stomach, causing shivers to run through Shizuru's body at her feather-light touch. 
Her hands came up to just below the swell of Shizuru's breasts before they paused, taunting 
Shizuru with the touch she so desired. “Perhaps I could do that. On the other hand, perhaps 
I could do... <i>this</i>!”</p><p>Natsuki's fingers dissolved into a blur as she furiously 
started to tickle Shizuru's ribs. Shizuru screamed out in shock, her shrieks dissolving into 
uncontrollable laughter as Natsuki began to torment her. It would have been impossible for 
her to keep her composure even if she'd wanted to, such was the power of Natsuki's fingers 
on her body. As it was, Shizuru at least tried to eke out a minor victory by refusing to 
plead for mercy until Natsuki was done with her.</p><p>This became harder and harder to do 
hough, as Natsuki started to apply her fingers to other parts of Shizuru's body. Her armpits 
were the next target to be hit, and then her sides, and then Natsuki's hands started 
attacking Shizuru at random, forcing Shizuru to at last cry out for mercy, “Ah, stop... 
stop....”</p><p>“Oh, I'll stop,” Natsuki said, relenting just enough for Shizuru to focus on 
her words given sufficient effort, “as soon as you admit something sufficiently embarrassing 
to me.”</p><p>Shizuru took just a moment to consider Natsuki's words, but it was a moment 
too long. Natsuki resumed her assault on Shizuru's senses, and all she could think about was 
trying to come up with something to say to get herself out, embarrassment be damned. 
Besides, it was Natsuki. She'd find out everything sooner or later anyways.</p><p>“Ah-ha... 
ah! Okay, okay!” Natsuki might have been tormenting Shizuru at the moment, but she wasted no 
time in relenting when Shizuru offered surrender. She even let Shizuru take a moment to 
catch her breath without calling her on a false surrender. “Alright... I... I enjoy it when 
Natsuki is dominant,” Shizuru said, her head turned to the side so as not to face Natsuki 
directly as she admitted this.</p><p>Shizuru couldn't inspect Natsuki's expression from her 
position, so she was surprised when she received a grunt from the girl. “I already figured 
that one out. You weren't exactly subtle about begging me to molest you.”</p><p>Shizuru 
looked over at Natsuki as she heard this, once again giving the girl her best puppy eyes in 
hopes that she could avoid more tickling. “Is Natsuki going to torture another confession 
out of me then? She should know that I respond much better to positive 
reinforcement...”</p><p>The puppy eyes seemed to work this time, or at least Natsuki had had 
her fill of tormenting Shizuru. She let out a sigh and allowed herself to lie down on 
Shizuru, looking right into her eyes. “Eh, I guess you've had enough. My bloodlust is sated, 
at least for the time being.” Natsuki lowered her head the couple extra inches necessary for 
her lips to meet with Shizuru's, giving her girlfriend a slow and soft kiss.</p><p>“Ara...” 
Shizuru smiled at the image of cuteness just above her once Natsuki withdrew. She was sure 
that she had a blush on her cheeks once again, and she hoped the Natsuki was appreciating it 
just as much as she was appreciating her love's visage. “Does that mean I get my 
cuddle-puppy back?”</p><p>Natsuki glared at Shizuru. She was probably trying to look strong, 
but it just made her even cuter in Shizuru's current mood. “Maybe. If you can come up with 
something else embarrassing that I don't know, then we can see about some 'positive 
reinforcement.'”</p><p>Shizuru pouted and stuck out her tongue at Natsuki. 
“Ikezu.”</p><p>All Shizuru was rewarded with for this was another glare from Natsuki. “Don't 
try to tempt me with that tongue. Secret first, then I'll deal with your 
tongue.”</p><p>“Fine, fine...” Shizuru said with a sigh. She rolled her head off to the side 
as she tried to think something up. An idea quickly arose, but she just as quickly discarded 
it. <i>Oh no, I'm certainly not telling Natsuki about </i>that<i> just yet. I have to think 
of something else...</i></p><p>“Oi!” Natsuki's cry made Shizuru look up at her again. “You 
just did think of something, didn't you? Well, spit it out, or no molestation for 
you!”</p><p>Shizuru let out a sigh. There was no helping it then. But perhaps she could at 
least bargain for a few perks in exchange. She wrapped her arms around Natsuki and looked up 
into her love's eyes. “Alright, but it's a big one. Will Natsuki promise to actually molest 
me this time? And let me provide her with some supplies?”</p><p>Natsuki blinked at this. 
“Supplies?”</p><p>Shizuru gave her girlfriend her mischievous grin. “Well, if Natsuki 
doesn't want her captive to escape, she's going to want to restrain her properly. And then 
she's going to need the proper tools if she wants to completely overwhelm her captive with 
pleasure...”</p><p>“Okay!” Natsuki cut Shizuru off, her cheeks filling with an adorable 
pink. “Fine, fine, you can get your toys. At least this way you aren't springing them on me. 
Now come on, out with it!”</p><p>“Natsuki no ikezu...” Shizuru said, giving an exaggerated 
sniffle. “I would never use something on her she wasn't prepared for... does she think me 
some sort of perverted rapist? This from my own girlfrie-ah!” Shizuru's attempted tease was 
cut off as Natsuki sat back up, and started viciously tickling Shizuru's ribs and sides 
again. “Ahhh! Sorry, sorry!”</p><p>After an extra couple seconds of tickling for good 
measure, Natsuki relented. “Alright, now you tell me this second, or for every second you 
make me wait, you're getting a minute of tickling.”</p><p>“Alright, alright!” Shizuru said. 
She took a deep breath to help steady her voice, closed her eyes, and forced the words out. 
“I'm nervous about telling my father about you because I know he'll tease me about 
it.”</p><p>Shizuru had been expecting laughter from Natsuki – a snicker at least. What she 
hadn't been expecting was a coo of adoration. She opened up her eyes just in time to see 
Natsuki coming in to catch her in a kiss. Confused as she might be, of course she could 
never refuse a kiss from her beloved. Even now, kissing Natsuki gave her the same thrill it 
did their first time. Natsuki's lips were so sweet that Shizuru had completely forgotten 
about why they were kissing by the time Natsuki pulled back.</p><p>“Sorry, Shizuru...” 
Natsuki said. “The thought of you getting teased as a child by your father was just too 
cute. I couldn't resist.” Shizuru pouted at this, but Natsuki roundly ignored it. She 
brought a hand to cup Shizuru's cheek, which Shizuru couldn't help but cuddle into as her 
pout faded. “It's fine, love. You can come out to him whenever you're ready. But I do still 
want to meet your parents sometime soon, so don't put it off too long.”</p><p>Shizuru smiled 
at her love. Natsuki was just too good to be true. Except she wasn't allowed to think that 
now. <i>Hmm... how about: Natsuki is so good she deserves to take me as her sex slave 
tonight, along with a large bag of goodies for her to use as she pleases. Perfect.</i> 
“Thank you. Natsuki is truly too sweet.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Natsuki said. Her lips pulled up in 
an amused grin. “But don't think I didn't notice that look on your face. I swear, you're 
just insatiable. Can't you at least wait until after dinner? I wanted to just take the 
afternoon easy to regain my energy. Maybe cuddle with you while watching TV or playing video 
games, and look where you've gotten us!”</p><p>“Sorry, Natsuki...” Shizuru said, trying to 
give Natsuki a chagrined look instead of letting her mind drift into thoughts of Natsuki 
punishing her for being a naughty girl. “But...what did you mean by video 
games?”</p><p>Natsuki sat back up, finally freeing Shizuru from her weight, which Shizuru 
immediately missed of course. Shizuru pulled herself up to a sitting position, hoping that 
Natsuki might choose to cuddle up against her soon. Sadly, she was just a bit distracted 
with their conversation at this moment, and her cute blush was starting to distract Shizuru 
as well. “Er...well, I thought maybe I could try to teach you to play some of my games. 
Thought it might be something fun to do together...”</p><p>Shizuru couldn't help herself. 
She pounced forwards and grabbed Natsuki in a happy hug. “I'd love to, Natsuki.” Shizuru 
couldn't really explain it, but the thought of just having fun and passing the time with 
Natsuki sounded better than anything else in the world.</p><p><i>Well... almost anything. 
But the anticipation will make it all the better. I just hope Natsuki will be ready to make 
me explode tonight.</i></p><p>“Oi, Shizuru... you're making that face again.”</p><p>“Ara, 
then Natsuki had better start distracting me.”</p>
