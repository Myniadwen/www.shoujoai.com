<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With regard to “reducing”  dislocated joints:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Normally, when  somebody dislocates a joint, it’s best not to attempt to force it back into  place, a practice commonly known in the medical community and among its  constituents as “reducing.”  With a  wrist, this is doubly true, as the wrist is an extremely delicate joint,  meaning that even if a reduction is attempted, it may only make it worse.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">However, in cases  where it’s obvious circulation has been cut off to the hand, and no medical  attention is available, it may be prudent to, very delicately, at least attempt  to unpinch the vein that’s been blocked.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">(End medical spiel)</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Death will come when I’m good and ready</em></span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I am / My Letter #4</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  man with the raspy voice felt no guilt about Minoru Alder.  Perhaps if he’d known the truth about the  death of his partner, he would have, but it would not have changed Minoru’s  fate.  Period.  His word was his word.  It was not befitting for a commander to make  exceptions for his subordinates, for any reason.  Especially not for a subordinate who had now  killed one of his other subordinates.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yes,  he had killed…what was his name again?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  man mused for a moment, came up with nothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  had killed his subordinate and then fled. That made him both a coward and an enemy.  Charges of cowardice alone were enough to  earn him a death sentence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">His  desertion, however, did not faze the man in the slightest. Nothing did.  He had many more subordinates than merely Minoru, his partner, and the  other one. And he had money in any case;  oh, how he had money.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  supposed considering the shattered state of his organization, he should hold  onto money more tenaciously, not spend it on more subordinates.  But this took precedence, he thought, over  paying some old men’s pensions.  If they  didn’t understand...well, then, perhaps they were cowards, as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  the man with the raspy voice was not a coward. Not in any way.  He would do it  himself if he had to, such was the strength of his conviction.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not  that he would have to, of course. That was what the money was for.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Minoru  had absolutely no idea what that boy, Akira was his name, had done to him, and  frankly, he didn’t want to know.  It was  like every last one of his muscles was utterly cramped up, tense, unable to  move, and in a sort of dull, thumping agony that reminded him of a few of his  worse nights—and mornings—back during the Lazy Years.  Small miracle, his neck muscles were mostly  lax, which was probably why he was still alive right now. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lax  enough to cuss up a storm earlier. </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not  that this had done him any good.  He  would have thought that the dumbfuck cornpoke cops not two blocks away would  have been alert enough to hear him, or notice the van blazing away at what  couldn’t have been anywhere near the speed limit.  Or at least, that was what he was  speculating; it was surprisingly difficult to be a good judge of speed when  your view consisted of a dusty linen floor and a lump of black cloth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What  a dignified way for an old-guard sniper such as Minoru Alder to travel. <em>You deserve it, though; you managed to get  yourself caught by a bunch of fucking </em>kids, <em>Minoru, </em>he thought. <em>Nice job. </em> He had even shut up completely  as soon as they had thrown the cloth over him. Rolling over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  had a hard time feeling really bad about this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Rolling over keeps you alive. Give it time;  you’ll get out of this. </em>He thought  this with a confidence born of years of Getting Out of This by simply giving it  time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  would be no different. No different.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No  different.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  was just getting settled into biding his time when time decided it was done  biding him.  The van went over what was  quite possibly the largest bump he had ever felt while laying, completely  incapacitated, underneath a cloth blanket in the trunk of a van.  Nobody said anything, in spite of the fact  that they had taken it so fast and so hard that there was no way that the van  could be wholly intact, but as he landed, he landed on his wrist.  Hard.  Pain  flared and he heard something <em>pop</em>, and  he screamed just as the van settled into a stop.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was a general murmur—really, it was an overarching gasp from all but four of  the van’s occupants, but the sudden, flaring pain in his wrist had a parallel  effect of stuffing cotton balls into his ears—from in front of him, and he dug  his teeth into his lower lip as he rolled off of the wrist, his other hand  flying up to clutch it protectively.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">His  other hand…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not  that Minoru particularly cared, but the sudden motion had broken that massive  cramp, like a button to restart a machine. Only this button was his wrist and it was <em>really fucking—<br />
</em>Light as the van  of the trunk opened, the blanket was practically thrown off of him, and he  found himself staring straight into the face of the girl who had lecherously  taken a piss in the middle of the night while he observed the sexy snoring  party.  Orange-red hair, serious face,  big, expressive blue eyes which were presently staring at him with a bizarre  absence of fear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  fact, there was an abundance of melancholy at that moment in those eyes.<em> Oh, look. There is a man hiding under a blanket in the back of our van.  How wonderful, this is the perfect addition  to this wonderful beach trip. </em>Complete  lack of emotion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  stared at him for a moment, and others began to gather—a boy with faux-blonde  hair in a fairly dorky spike-cut; a short girl in braids, a pretty girl with  dark hair in a veryurban <em>chic </em>cut, who had her arm unscrupulously  and causally draped about a simple-looking sort of girl with long, brown  hair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Standing  well behind them, trying to look more nonchalant than a criminal caught walking  off with a bag of loot but failing miserably, were his captors.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  are you?” the pretty orange-haired girl’s tone was as melancholy as her face,  and suddenly, Minoru thought, <em>you poor  bastard, </em>a feeling of deep sympathy that he hadn’t felt in years rushing to  his head and his heart in an instant.  In  the next instant, he shoved it back down, helped out by another surge of pain  from his wrist.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My  wrist is…I think it’s dislocated.”  His  voice was very hoarse considering that he hadn’t used it in at least twenty  minutes.  “I think.  I think I need…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  urban-<em>chic </em>girl peered at him through  trendy-ish glasses.  “Oh-ho,” she said,  her voice positively <em>ripe </em>with a  sudden gleeful interest that did not at all hold with the other girl’s  mood.  “Do we have a pervert stowaway  here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nngh,”  Minoru replied, the pain starting to intensify again as his momentary interest  in a close-up encounter with the people he’d been looking at through a scope  only a night before vanished.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  braided girl, previously looking almost as morose as the orange-haired one, said  with a sudden dose of fascination, “I think he’s starting to turn purple.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Behind  them, Natsuki was starting to look a little bit sheepish, trying to casually  wander off.  Midori grabbed her by the  shoulder, a shit-eating grin on her face, shaking her head.  Silently, she said, <em>This was your idea.  You stick  around. </em>A moment later, she turned  her head, and said the same thing to somebody that Minoru couldn’t see.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Meanwhile,  Minoru was dying of agony and being stared at by a group of teenagers that  looked like they wanted to poke him with a stick to see if he’d move.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  they seemed to be taking a fair measure of glee in it, at that.  The boy showed a measure of concern on his  face, but it wasn’t a big one.  They all  thought he was a fucking <em>pervert. </em>A peeping tom.</span></p>
“Tell  us, mister pervert,” Glasses said, “Just which one of us were you staring at,  exactly?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mrgh,”  Minoru said, marveling at his internal lucidity, especially when faced with his  outward incoherency and the <em>NUMBING PAIN  IN MY WRIST</em>. He noticed that the very edges of his vision were starting to  turn white, and he tried again.  “My  wrist,” he said, his mouth working slowly, awkwardly, like it had cotton balls  in it (it actually came out something like <em>my  rischt</em>), “is dislocated, and I feel very much as though I am about to  die.”  Minoru was not precisely used to  pain—snipers didn’t tend to be.  As a  rule, if you fell under enemy fire, you died or they did. The last time Minoru  had heard of a sniper heroically limping home wit a damaged leg was when one of  his coworkers in the Sino-Russian conflict had fallen out of a tree.  He had weighed about two hundred pounds, and  Minoru had thought he’d deserved it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Glasses  only smiled, a bit sadistically.  “Maybe  you should have thought of that before you decided to stow away in the back of  our van, mister pervert.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  was about to shoot a clever retort back at her, something to the effect of <em>braggh nngh wagh, </em>but before he could,  Midori put her hand on urban-<em>chic</em>’s  shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chie,”  Midori said calmly, her voice a bastion of forced gentility—the kind that was  obviously fake—“It’s okay.  He’s not a  pervert.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  raised an eyebrow at Midori, not used to her leadership.  Being fair, Midori wasn’t fully used to  Midori’s leadership either, nor would she ever be.  That, however, was not something she  frequently thought on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  that’s true,” Chie said, being careful but quick, “why was he stowing out in the  back of our van?” It was obvious that she was more curious about questioning  him for details than she was about preserving her own dignity as she said this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  had the grace to look a little bit sheepish in front of Minoru as her brain  went into complete and utter lock-up.  “Ah…about  that, you see…it’s…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>a complicated, heart-wrenching story, with  reasons greater and deeper than the Mariana trench</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  complicated…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>that’s what you used to be<br />
  cant think can you<br />
  cant do shit<br />
  anything <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“and he-heart  wrenching story.  With…ah…reasons…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  was staring at her like she was trying to wave bye-bye with a third breast.  Midori was going red, but not from  embarrassment; she felt like she was giving a lecture with a horrible  stutter.  She just <em>couldn’t. get. the. words. out.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>THINK<br />
  cant think thinking means thinking about<br />
  THINK<br />
  that </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  was behind her, and his hand was warm on her shoulder.  She didn’t move this time, if only for fear  of appearing weak in front of the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s a story behind it, but it’s too  complicated to explain, as our …ah,” he frowned, having spoken himself into a  corner when he was forced to address Minoru as <em>something</em>.  He was silent for  a moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  moment would have, at this point, taken Midori an hour; when it passed, and the  word he was looking for came to him, he continued, “guest appears to be passing  out.  I think it would be prudent to take  him inside now, and perhaps give him something for the pain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">From  his dignified position whimpering and clutching his wrist, Minoru suggested,  humbly, “and if any of you know how to fix a dislocated wrist, I’d be most  appreciative.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  managed a small grin, and directed it at Minoru. “I think I know somebody who  can help you out,” she said.  Her voice  was strained and quiet, as though pressing against a wall that prevented her  from passing a certain volume.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  and Chie both frowned, and Chie said, “You do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  shrugged.  “I know people who know  people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  just happen to be in Goza?” Mai said with a little frown.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>My best friend’s a doctor, okay? I learn a  thing or two. Step off, </em>Midori thought, and then wondered why she refused  to simply come out and talk about herself to some of her closest friends.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Once  again, it was Reito who stepped in to save her. “We’ll take care of it.  Don’t  worry about it.” His voice was confident, cool, his grin wide and  trustworthy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nobody  bought it.  “I think what really  concerns me,” Chie said, her tone a little hostile, “is why it is that there’s  a person in the trunk of this van and you didn’t tell us about it.”  It was clear that she was taking this a  little personally. There was a fire in her eyes that Mai, at least, had never  seen before.  Aoi put an arm on Chie’s  shoulder, and Chie relaxed a little, but not much.  This would have been better for Reito and  Midori if Aoi didn’t have the same disbelief in her eyes that the rest of them  did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Where the hell did Shizuru and Natsuki go? </em>Midori  glanced around quickly, found that they’d vanished from sight, cursed. <em>They’re  probably off somewhere fucking, the goddamn… </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She stopped,  unable to fathom the depths to which this train of thought drove her  bitterness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What  was worse, it wasn’t because they’d ditched out on them at a crucial  moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  wasn’t even that they had ditched out, she presumed, to go fuck somewhere in a  bush.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was that both of them had <em>found </em>somebody  to fuck in a bush.  Somebody that wasn’t  going to have a heart attack in the middle of the desert.  Somebody that</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um,”  Minoru said, breaking the stand-off between Chie and Reito, “I’m glad you guys  listened to mommy and daddy when they told you not to talk to strangers or let  them ride in your trunk, really I am. I’m sure they’d be proud.  But, ah, I don’t know your name,” with his  eyes, he indicated either Midori, Reito, or a tree trunk about ten yards back,  “but if you <em>do </em>have a friend who  knows a friend or whatever, I’d be glad to get some on-site medical attention.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I wonder how pissed Yohko would be at being  called all the way out here, </em>Midori wondered briefly, before Minoru  continued, “But unless your friend is a professional orthopediatrician, they won’t  be able to do much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At  this point, Midori noticed that his hand was starting to turn a little blue.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>He’s losing circulation to that hand really  quickly; he’s going to lose the hand if he’s not careful. <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> He might be a bastard,  but he might not be, too. <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> But he’s still a god  damned </em>person<em>. <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  tried to go towards him, to try and get him out of the van and take him  somewhere where she could splint his wrist, but her feet locked up. <em>You can’t do it. <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  little voice told her, <em>just let Reito do  it.  He can do it better than you can  anyway.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Every  self-doubt binge has its limit.  That  limit usually comes when the little voice in the back of your head, the one  that tells you, <em>you can’t do it, you  can’t do it, you can’t do it, </em>says something that violates some tenet that  you hold so dear to yourself that it becomes utterly impossible to believe the  voice anymore.  For Midori Sugiura, that  tenet that she valued above all about herself was violated here, now.  She was who she was, and <em>nobody…</em>nobody…would take away her passion.  If she wanted to do something, nobody would  do it for her simply because they could and she could not.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Bam. <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For a full five  seconds, Midori couldn’t see a thing. Her vision dropped out, and the world  dropped out from underneath her.  But the  world wasn’t what was falling; she was. This crutch that she’d been leaning on since the Professor’s death.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was the crutch of ambivalence. <em>If nothing matters to me at all, if I let  anything that wants </em>in <em>attack my body  and my mind, then </em>his <em>death doesn’t  matter either. <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She had let things  attack both her body and mind.  Men had  wanted <em>in, </em>and she had let them in  for a night, as they, convinced that she was drunk on what was actually nothing  but orange juice, took her in whatever way they, <em>actually </em>drunk, had wanted. Self-doubt knocked on her door, and instead of sneering in its face, she  opened the door and took its coat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> Fuck you. <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her feet still moved  slowly.  Her brain was still sluggish.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  she had changed the current.  She was  Midori Sugiura, and she had done it all by her fucking self.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Not by yourself.  You needed<br />
  </em>his<br />
  <em> help.<br />
    He stands only a bit  taller than I do. His hair is<br />
    black<br />
    graying, and he has a  kind of constantly<br />
    confident </em><br />
  <em>analytical expression on his face.  And he helps me.<br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> I don’t like Reito  like I did the Professor. </em>At this point, she had no idea whether that was a  lie or the truth.  It was simply what she  thought, and she could trust it for the moment. She also knew that people didn’t get over things this fast, and that she  wasn’t anywhere near out of the woods yet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> That’s all right. <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My friend is a  school nurse,” Midori said, digging in the pocket of her vest for her cell  phone.  “She’s probably treated more  dislocated wrists than a professional orthowhatever. Give me two seconds.”  Her voice was still a little strained, but  her words were flowing again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Midori,”  Reito murmured, “Are you sure about this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut  up, Reito,” Midori said lightly, and punched in Yohko’s number, held the phone  to her ear, praying that her friend was somewhere near her phone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Ring. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> Ring. <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> Ring. <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Third ring.  Always. <em>To make sure they mean business. <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,” Yohko  answered, her voice airy and familiar, even with the slightly metallic tone the  phone forced onto it.  “Thought you were  in Goza.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  am in Goza,” Midori said.  “Listen, are  you at all sober right now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  got an ugly look on his face; it was the look of a man who had the undeniable  feeling that he was hopelessly, irrevocably fucked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Almost  totally,” Yohko said without a hint of defensiveness. “It’s the break, so I’m  sure I’m buzzed from somewhere.  Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  need to know how to reduce a dislocated wrist.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  dislocated their wrist?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nobody  you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  why, exactly, are you talking to me instead of an emergency dispatcher?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  didn’t answer.  There was a moment of  silence between them. Then, “Are you in trouble, Midori?”  Her voice was very serious.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not sure yet, Yohko.  I’m really  not.  But his hand is starting to turn  blue, and I think he’s going to lose it if we don’t do something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  you’re not going to call an ambulance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  would if I could.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  you can’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  I can’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yohko  sighed.  “I thought you were going to  take it easy for a while.”</span></p>
“Me  too.  Are you going to help me out or  not?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  wrist is really delicate, Midori,” Yohko said firmly.  “You’re just as likely to fuck it up even  further trying to fix it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  we don’t do something soon, he’s going to lose it. It’s pretty bad; I think he  pinched a vein.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  sure?” Yohko said.</span></p>
“No,”  Midori said it as confidently as somebody could be when admitting they didn’t  know something.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another  sigh. “Fine.  First, have somebody go  find a stick and something to make a splint with. Medical tape is best, but  anything gentle will work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then  Midori started dishing out orders, and for a while, anyway, she felt better.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  was still going to fucking kill Natsuki and Shizuru, though.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Natsuki  felt a little bad about ditching out on the group like that, especially when  she was supposed to be taking partial responsibility for something, but, in  fairness, it wasn’t all her fault.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  hadn’t stopped holding her hand since they’d gotten out of the van.  Nobody had noticed, probably because they  were all preoccupied with a strange man in their trunk, but the look in  Shizuru’s eyes said that their inattention most certainly was not the reason  she was taking the kind of liberties that she was taking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  look in Shizuru’s eyes said that she was hungry.  Natsuki had seen it once before…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>in a dream<br />
  kimono is loose as she  leans in <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">but she couldn’t  put her finger on it; like she’d blocked it out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you sure you’re okay leaving them like this?” Natsuki asked a little  tentatively, testing the figurative mud that she felt she was about to step in,  to decide if moving further would drown her or only get her pants a little messy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  said nothing; simply led Natsuki on, moving quietly through underbrush and sand  towards the cabin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shizuru?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  reality, Natsuki didn’t think that Shizuru would feel at all bad about  abandoning the group up there.  What she  wanted was for Shizuru to speak.  About  something; anything. Her silence was more frightening than…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Than when she talks to you about what </em>she <em>wants. <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They made it  around the cabin, out of sight of the van, and Shizuru stopped moving, her head  pointed down, her hair obscuring most of her face.  Natsuki stopped as well, trying her best to  study Shizuru’s face. Natsuki felt her body tense up and for a moment, there  was utter silence; not even the ocean seemed to want to make noise for her. The  stillness only made Natsuki want to shiver. To fill the void.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then,  “Natsuki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“E…eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  did you do that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  looked up, and her face both scared Natsuki and melted her; it was hungry and  sad all at once: Hungry by the way her eyes flickered up and down, taking in  every inch of her; sad by the way her lip twitched as she did it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shizuru,”  Natsuki said quietly, and reached out for her with one hand.  Her face was sympathetic, kind, and Shizuru  let her hunger take her, fueled by the gentleness in Natsuki’s face, like a  lion was fueled by the gentle aura of its prey.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  took the hand and used it to pull Natsuki to her, and in the next moment,  Natsuki felt, for the second time that day, Shizuru’s lips on hers.  They were warm, moist, and they felt both wonderful  and terrible, all at once. <em><br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki kissed her  back, even while she considered whether she wanted to or not. <em>It was  supposed to be ‘just this once,’ </em>she thought, a little bemused as she felt  Shizuru’s tongue press itself onto hers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  had no idea what to do with that tongue. She had never really kissed anybody like this before; even their earlier  lip-lock had been nothing like this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  wasn’t sure she was comfortable with it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It feels wonderful<br />
  But it feels terrible,  too</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  wasn’t comfortable with it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But if you reject her now, </em>she thought, <em>with somebody specifically targeting her as  they are, can you really keep your eye on her? Can you really… </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru broke the  kiss, and looked Natsuki straight in the eye, and whispered, “I love you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  did get overzealous on very rare occasions. Ironically, or perhaps not so much so, all of these occasions seemed to  involve Natsuki in some way.  Shizuru <br />
      <em>leans in as I lay there, practically  unconscious from the fever ravaging my body.<br />
      </em>kissed her  again.  It was<br />
      <em>the  first time I’ve been sick in years. But I’m still awake enough to remember the  feeling of<br />
    </em>sweet; it felt  good, mostly somewhere low in her body. The passion warmed her someplace she hadn’t felt warm in for a long  time.  And yet, something about it,  something about</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> her painted lips on  mine.  It feels… <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> wrong<br />
  sick. <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki felt a  wave of revulsion take her, emanating from her lips and coursing down to her  stomach.  She felt her gorge rise a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If you lead her on and then reject her, she  might never<br />
  </em>forgive you<br />
  <em> let you go, even if  you want her to.<br />
    But you can’t do this  yet.<br />
    But she may hate you  for it. <br />
    But you can’t. <br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She knew this was  true.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  she also knew that she couldn’t say no.  So  she did something she had never done before: She broke the kiss and copped out.  “Shizuru,” she whispered, “not here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For  a moment, an ugly, dangerous look came over Shizuru’s face, and for that same  moment Natsuki was suddenly certain that Shizuru was going to strike her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then  it passed and Shizuru nodded.  “You’re  probably right,” she said tautly.  “We  wouldn’t want to be discovered.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  nodded nervously, feeling—no, knowing—full well that she had just dug herself  into a hole that she may not be able to escape, and said, “We should get back  to the others.”  She felt her stomach  sink with dread at the prospect of being buried alive in the half-truth she had  just told, simply by omission; but something, some small little voice inside of  her, told her that there was not a thing she could do about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  nodded, accepting—at a level somewhere near the surface, anyway—Natsuki’s need  to be subtle about the two of them for the moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  still insisted on holding Natsuki’s hand on the way back up.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
When  Shizuru and Natsuki arrived at the top of the hill again, the first thing they  saw was Reito with Minoru mounting him from behind.  Natsuki’s immediate thought was, <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">funny, people always kind of suspected that  about him, but I never thought he would have revealed it now, of all times. </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A moment later,  Reito stood up straight, giving Minoru essentially a piggyback ride.  Minoru supported himself with his one good  hand, and rested his bad one on Reito’s shoulder.  There was a fairly well-fashioned splint  already lining the back of his hand, made from a very straight stick and some  medical tape that somebody had found in the glove compartment of the van.  In spite of this, Minoru’s face was an ugly  mask of pain, for which nobody could blame him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  was still looking skeptical and angry, but Aoi was speaking to her in low  tones, and with each word, Chie seemed to calm significantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  cast a glance at Natsuki and Shizuru as they arrived, less angry than she would  have expected. They were, indeed, holding hands, but something about the way  the whole thing had turned out without their help seemed to calm her.  She would have to tie the two of them up and  give them a stern talking-to about running off in the middle of a crisis to  have sex later, but as it was…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  grinned at her as best he could as he carried Minoru down the small flight of  steps to the cabin.  He had been the one  to unpinch Minoru’s vein, in the end; his being the steadiest fingers of all of  theirs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  it was, Midori was sober <em>and </em>satisfied  with the way things were, for possibly the first time since they had arrived on  that beach.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  could deal with the rest later.</span></p>
