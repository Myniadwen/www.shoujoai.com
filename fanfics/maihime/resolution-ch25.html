<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And so,  here we are. Our long adventure is starting to approach its climax,  after what seems like a novel’s length (and, in fact, is).  I hope  you’ve enjoyed yourself nearly as much as I have.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’m sure  you’re all wondering precisely what happened to the rest of our  party—Midori, Shizuru, Mai, and the like.  I think the best that I  can tell you is that you might not find out for a while. Or maybe you  might, if you’re clever.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’d  die alone, but not for you.</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Remedy</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As soon as he saw the  man who was to “escort” him to the jet which was waiting to “take  him home,” Minoru found himself regretting not taking karate  lessons as a child, as though becoming a modern-day martial arts  expert might have given him a snowball’s chance in hell. In another  part of his mind, he compared this to a mouse receiving martial arts  lessons to battle an angry housewife with a broom and a shotgun.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru’s “escort”  was probably the largest man he had ever seen up close—he had seen  larger through a scope, and he had always been grateful that they  were far enough away that he <em>needed </em>a scope to see them.  Now  he had no such luck.  The man was at least six-three, and might have  been two hundred and fifty if Minoru could somehow strip and starve  him for a few days.  He was large, and not just in height and muscle,  but in <em>everything</em>.  He seemed to widen to eclipse the setting  sun as he approached Minoru, who shortly realized that he was  unarmed, a fact that unsettled him greatly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minoru Alder?” he  asked in perfectly coherent Japanese. <em>Funny. I didn’t know  mountains could be well-spoken. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s me.” <em>Let’s get this through with, huh? I don’t have all day to be  torn into dog food. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not  all-Japanese, huh.” The man observed this as a normal man might  have observed the weather.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh,” Minoru  observed equally blandly, if one discounted the twinge of fear in his  voice, like that of a petulant schoolboy being led into the  principal’s office for a stern paddling.  “Mummy was British.  Daddy worked for Toshiba.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where’d that  leave you?” the man’s voice didn’t change, nor did anything in  his face, but as he began advancing on him, Minoru became  aware—simply <em>gained knowledge, </em>perhaps—that he was about  to be beaten, and harshly.  He did his best to shrink back towards  the chair that was the center of this empty, prisonlike room, trying,  vainly, to find something that might save him from having his face  broken. He could find none.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No, that’s not  true.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was one.  This man spoke with perfect Japanese, but he wore a Swiss pistol.  A  Sig Sauer.  Good pistol. Lot of kick.  He wore it in a holster which  was unbuttoned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Unbuttoned? He  planning on using that? If so, why the façade of a jet? I can  hear it going in the background. Why did they let me live at all if  they were just planning on putting one in my skull soon as nobody  else was looking? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Royally  fucked, apparently,” Minoru said, and then the big man hit him in  the stomach.  Pain erupted as a volcano might, and his air left him  violently, so thoroughly that he felt as though his lungs were  nothing but vacuum. He sank to his knees, hugging his chest, and  looked up at the guy, whose face hadn’t changed an ounce.  “You  planning on killing me here, or what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,” the man  said, “I wasn’t actually supposed to; I was supposed to stick you  on the plane, which would take you back to Tokyo, where you would be  shot in a hit-and-run robbery four days from now, but I had buddies  over in Goza. You know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This did not come as a  surprise to Minoru, rather merely validating what he already knew.  “Yeah,” he said. “I know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man hit him again,  this time in the face, and Minoru was sent sprawling to the floor,  which was an excellent position from which to be kicked in the ribs.  Never one to waste an opportunity, the man broke one of Minoru’s  ribs in just such a manner.  Minoru cried out in agony, his eyes  welling with tears as he squeezed them shut, and when he opened his  them, the man’s face, blurry though it was, was remarkably near  his.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shhh,” the man  said, putting a finger to his own lips.  “You scream too loud,  they’ll notice you’re not on the plane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something was funny  about the way the man squatted.  He didn’t squeeze his arms or legs  at all when he did it; maybe it was because he thought Minoru utterly  incapacitated, or maybe because he just wasn’t used to kicking the  shit out of a defenseless man.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And if you do that,  I might just have to take something of yours home with me.” His  eyes traveled low on Minoru, who squeezed his legs together at once,  a male-bred instinct. “Matsuda was a friend of mine, you know  that?”<br />
  “Never bothered to learn his name,” Minoru said  weakly, tasting blood. <em>Just a little too far out. I’m not tall  enough, so you have to move just a little bit closer. </em>Perhaps,  then, what Minoru said next was calculated for just this purpose, or  perhaps he merely had a smart ass and a smarter mouth. “Kinda  forgot to ask him on my way by. Was he the one who couldn’t roll  over quite fast enough, a little too friendly with the trigger and  not quite friendly enough with the scope?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man’s face  twitched at this, and he rose on his haunches, preparing to deliver  what would surely have been a death blow to Minoru’s face—his  thighs were certainly strong enough to dent metal, so breaking a neck  couldn’t have been any great stretch for him. As he drew back,  Minoru lurched forward and grabbed his other leg, and then <em>yanked, </em>with all of his not-inconsiderable strength, something the man  had obviously discounted.The man, large and strong but no  less bound by the laws of physics nor the theories of force and  torque than any of the rest of us, dropped, and it was now that  Minoru took something home with <em>him—</em>he pulled himself  forward a little further with speed he wasn’t sure he had in  himself, and grabbed the big man’s testicles first with one, then  with both fists.  And then, just as the man was beginning to wind up  to deliver that death-blow that Minoru was certain he could have,  even from his current position, Minoru took his hands off and did not  merely <em>shove, </em>but <em>hit. </em>He smashed his hands into the  man’s crotch as hard as he could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man’s testicles  did not come off. He was wearing jeans, and Minoru was not inhumanly  strong.  But when Minoru felt something give underneath his hands and  the man began to scream—shriek, really—he knew his job was done  nonetheless. The man immediately went into a fetal position.  Slowly,  painfully, Minoru stood up and took the man’s gun from his holster  and stuffed it in his own pants, now torn, but thankfully not at the  beltline.  He pulled his shirt over it, and then slowly, painfully  positioned himself over the man, above his head. If nobody was  responding to the man’s shrieks, probably nobody was in earshot  anyway, but people who were used to people dying around them tended  to hear gunshots better than screams anyway.  A gunshot meant you had  to get your head down. A scream meant somebody else hadn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man tried to move.  Minoru could hear him grunting, could see him struggling to force his  body to respond, to do something other than curl up and nurse its  pain.  But his testicles had long since retreated into his pelvis,  and his body was screaming at him, <em>hide! Hide and maybe he’ll  leave you alone! </em>His nerves were too alight to even <em>think </em>about running.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">His hands started to  move, and Minoru knew that if given the chance, the man might soon do  to him exactly what he had done.  He was remarkably strong—Minoru  thought that if he had just lost both of his testicles to one angry  fist and one strong pelvic bone, he might simply die—but his body  could not move fast enough to keep Minoru from placing his shoe on  the man’s neck, and then, after only a moment’s hesitation, from  lifting it up again and bringing it down, allowing all of his weight  to go with it—probably nearly a hundred sixty pounds, though he had  not weighed himself in quite some time.  Something sickening inside  of the man <em>cracked, </em>and then he stopped moving, his eyes  widening in horror as he realized that he had wasted most of the last  air he would ever draw on a useless scream.  His face began to turn  blue almost immediately, and Minoru wanted to look away, immediately  feeling a pang deep inside of him—it was, somehow, always less  personal through a scope, and while he had killed people up close  before, it had always been with a gun, and never his fist and foot;  he could have even killed him with the knife in his belt which Minoru  now removed. There was something primal about it, and while some  might have reveled in it, Minoru Alder felt his stomach recoil  against itself.  Another second, and he had lost all of whatever he  had eaten recently—and there wasn’t nearly as much of it as a  doctor might have liked—onto the man’s face.  This alone made  Minoru want to vomit again, almost immediately, and so he turned away  and left.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I had to do it. He  would have killed me, and then who the hell would have saved those  kids? Because god knows they need saving, just as much as the girl  downstairs does. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Like you’ll be  the one to do it, old man. You know exactly what you’re planning to  do—you’re planning on taking that plane back to Tokyo and laying  low for the next two months and praying to god nobody finds you. You  killed him to save your own life, and that’s all there is to it.  Nothing wrong with that. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It troubled  Minoru to learn that this voice made a practical sort of sense.  Troubled him even more to learn that this voice telling him that  killing that man in there so painfully was okay was not the same  voice telling him to help Natsuki downstairs and Midori…wherever  she was. He had a pretty good idea where he could find out, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So do you go, and  let your guilt slide?  Or do you stay and let it sit on you?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Either way, I think  I might hate myself for it. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It troubled  Minoru only slightly to learn that this last bit was not true.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">By the time he  had stretched his arms and legs out—tenderly—and exited the room,  the cold detachment had returned to him. But he didn’t forget that  ugly little moment when he had regretted everything.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He never forgot it  again.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
When the  amicably-dressed man returned, Natsuki still had not tried out the  door to her cell.  She believed the man when he said it was unlocked,  but she didn’t—she could think of no reason he had to keep her  locked up, but if that was the case, why was the door even <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">closed? </span></em>Good housekeeping? Nobody here raised in a barn?
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He opened the door  without using a key and the point became moot, but her paranoia did  not—she supposed that she had every reason to be calm, since if  they’d wanted her dead she’d be long for the other world by this  point, but this did not invalidate her nagging little suspicion that  they were just toying with her—or perhaps using her as a toy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He was rolling a  wheelchair—she had heard it coming down the hallway, <em>thump thump  thump thump,</em> the eerily rhythmic noise of the wheels clattering  along the cracks on the old stone floor—and smiling at her as he  opened the door and went to her to help her up.  “You’ll be glad  for me in just a moment, Miss Kuga,” he said cheerily.  “Please  allow me to help you up, since I doubt you’ll be able to move by  yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She wanted to shy away  from him for some reason, but she could hardly move her own legs, so  it was rather useless.  The man put his hands underneath her armpits  and gently lifted her into the old wheelchair—it <em>was </em>quite  old, actually; she could see bolts of cloth peeling off of the seat,  which she soon found was about as comfortable as sitting on a pole.  He was gentle, but Natsuki thought he felt him squeeze a little  excessively as he lifted—and not in the way she’d expected a man  to squeeze, either.  It made her edgy, as did just about everything,  it seemed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you’re  nervous, please do not concern yourself overly much with it,” the  man said, as though reading her mind.  “It’s probably a side  effect of the drugs we had to give you.” The man scratched his  beard absently, which had been trimmed slightly since Natsuki had  seen him last, though not shaven off entirely. It was little more  than a discoloration of his face which happened to make noise when  touched.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Just a few minutes  ago it was only </em>anesthesia.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell me  honestly,” she said. “How bad <em>are </em>my legs?”<em> Give it  to me straight, doc. Did you slice me open or did the bad guys? Will  I walk again? Will you smile if I can’t?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not awful,”  he said. “I wouldn’t walk on them today, and I wouldn’t run on  them for about a month, but you will certainly heal. You should be  grateful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I am,” she said  absently, and realized a second later that she only said this because  he wanted her to say it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He began to wheel her  out. The thumping was louder now, but just as rhythmic—he was  keeping the wheelchair at an utterly even pace. <em>He’s an  accountant. They have a thing for exactness. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She tried to tell this  to herself, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In truth, she just  felt helpless. If she really couldn’t walk…if she could barely  even <em>think </em>straight…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A plane started its  engine up.  She almost jumped out of her seat—the noise couldn’t  have been more than a hundred feet away, and the vibrations  threatened to shake the chair apart from underneath her.  “What the  hell?” she nearly shouted, and then caught herself. <em>Calm. Down.  If you’re really just on drugs…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You’re not.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>liar liar pants on  fire</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It would seem that  your mercenary friend is heading back to Tokyo,” the man said. “I  offered to let him stay here and work with my sharpshooters, in hopes  of rescuing your friends, but it would seem that he has taken the  safe road. I can’t honestly blame him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minoru was here?”  Natsuki said, all sorts of alarms going off in her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn’t tell  you?” the man said, and that little <em>scratch scratch </em>sound  drifted into Natsuki’s ears again. “I’m sorry. It must have  slipped my mind. Yes, we were able to pick him up as well. I can’t  blame him, honestly. We’re in far deeper than I think he cares to  deal with. From what I know of him, he is a small fry, really. Petty  assassinations, mostly Yakuza work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?”  Natsuki said, again absently, her mind now reeling from the thought  of Minoru abandoning them at this late date. <em>But why not? He </em>is <em>just a hired gun, even if this guy is lying.  Just somebody we got  stuck with.  Somebody who, in fact, tried to kill us. Just a  bullet-whore. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And yet, the  thought nagged at her heart.  Painfully.  Shizuru seemed to trust  him. <em>Had </em>seemed to trust him. Was he just going to…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Probably.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Click. </em>“Did  you say that you were working to rescue” <em>Shizuru </em>“the  others?” <em>click. The inappropriate directions of a fucked up  mind.  By Natsuki Kuga. </em>She fought the urge to giggle wildly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I did. I should  probably tell you what happened; forgive me, it had slipped my mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll keep it as  condensed as I can—really, I can’t provide much gory detail,  since I was not there, but I’ll tell you what I was told.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Essentially, your  rescue operation was ambushed by a military helicopter operated  by…somebody else. Sorry, but I can’t tell you who they are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because you can’t  or because you <em>can’t</em>?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sharp girl,” he  said. “Because I <em>can’t.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I understand.”  She did, but she still wanted to scream in frustration. They arrived  at the little elevator, which was open and waiting for them.  He  rolled her in first—<em>thumpTHUMP, over the threshold—</em>and  then stepped in himself, pressed a button, and the door slid shut.  Not knowing was killing her. Not <em>doing </em>was eating her soul.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We had word that  they were sending reinforcements, and so we were able to move in a  column of infantry and a medical humvee before they could take the  survivors from the wreckage.  We know they wanted you alive, or  they’d have done something more than simply wreck your vehicle. We  were able to shoot down the chopper thanks to a particularly acute  infantryman, but then our column was ambushed. We were only able to  recover you and Minoru before they pushed us back, so we took it as a  blessing and fell back.  We did manage to get a bead on where they  wound up going, so we’re staging rescue operations even as the two  of us ride up in this pleasantly air-conditioned elevator.”  The  man’s voice caught for a moment at the word <em>pleasant. </em>“You  remember nothing of this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing,” she  said honestly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s too bad.  But maybe it’s better that way. Such things are not easily  forgotten.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did you hear…of  any dead?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn’t hear of  any such thing, but then again, I didn’t hear of much at all beyond  what I needed to know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her legs began to  tingle uncontrollably.  She held her mouth shut, but her hands  gripped the sides of the chair tightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you okay?”  the man, once again, was fucking psychic. “Are your legs hurting?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” she said  more or less believably.  “I’m fine. Just a little  uncomfortable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m very sorry  about that, but you don’t have to lie if you’re in pain. I can  get you another injection in a few minutes, as soon as we reach the  top floor.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Liar liar pants on  fire. If we could hear the airplane, we’re not that far below  ground, if at all. This elevator moves slow and you don’t want me  knowing about it. You don’t want me knowing a damn thing about  where we are.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” she  said firmly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you sure?”  Something about his voice told Natsuki that he was asking out of  courtesy anyway—she was getting a shot at the top, like it or not.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That meant that she  had until the top to figure out what the fuck was going on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And why she was  starting to feel better so rapidly.  Why, in fact, she suddenly felt  as though she could take on the world—she had not felt so good, so  powerful, since the HiME carnival.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somewhere, far away,  Shizuru screamed, and Natsuki didn’t know it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She felt it, though.  Something clutched at her heart, and she gripped the handles even  tighter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I have to get out  of here. Right. Fucking. Now.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  screamed again, and Natsuki thought she might too.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Five hundred  feet in the air and half a mile away from the compound, the small  Cessna which had so haphazardly started and lifted off exploded. It  was empty at the time of the explosion, and there were three dead men  in the hangar where it had been waiting for Minoru, as promised. All  three of them had bullet holes in their head. Nobody heard the shots,  because Minoru had encountered another man on his way to the hangar,  a man who was wearing a silenced American-issue USP.  He had wondered  at the choice of weapon—after all, wasn’t this a Swiss  outfit?—but hadn’t stopped to think about it longer than it took  to gut the man with the knife he’d acquired from the Blue Man.  The  man had died without thinking about it, and Minoru hadn’t felt  nearly as bad.  Knives were better than feet for the guilt level.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Men began rushing out  of their places at the explosion, weapons ready.  When they realized  what had happened, they all went back to their posts as though they  had been expecting it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">None of them noticed  Minoru, hard at work with a small cellular phone pressed to his ear,  in a small brick building dubiously marked <em>generator and backup</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He was talking to one  of his friends.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Everybody had friends.</span></p>
