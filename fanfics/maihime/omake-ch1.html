fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;It&#39;s just not fair!&quot; Mayo heard a woman cry out
angrily, disturbing her walk outside the main school
buildings. The mountain campus was absurdly large for
a school of only a few hundred students, normally
providing plenty of space for them to be alone.

Mayo frowned slightly as the redhead walked around the
building to see a strange girl gathered with several
other students. Her hair was a vibrant orange, and she
had a bust that Mayo had to concede was somewhat
impressive. Oddly she also wore a orange school
uniform quite different than their own.

&quot;How can I not even be in this series?&quot; the strange
girl demanded to the others, all of whom Mayo had met
in the past few days, &quot;My name&#39;s even still in the
title!&quot;

&quot;Now, now Mai,&quot; Chie said reassuringly, the cut of her
brown hair giving her a boyish look, &quot;we don&#39;t know
you won&#39;t appear later.&quot;

&quot;The script says,&quot; Mai Tokhia slapped the sheets of
paper she was holding in the other hand, &quot;I died!&quot;

&quot;Ah, hello?&quot; Mayo said tentatively as she approached
the group.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Natsuki cursed, the dark blue haired girl
looking cross as she continued, &quot;we wanted to keep
this meeting private.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right, Natsuki,&quot; Shizuru reassured her, the
brown haired student council member looking as elegant
as ever. She dropped her voice as she whispered, &quot;If
needed, I can have Yukino erase these memories from
her mind.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Natsuki nodded.

&quot;So you&#39;re the one,&quot; Mai said with a sigh, studying
Mayo thoughtfully as she slowly circled around the
shorter girl.

&quot;I am?&quot; Mayo blinked nervously.

&quot;The new lead character,&quot; Mai murmured as she looked
Mayo over. After a moment she nodded, &quot;Well, at least
you&#39;re better than Akira was.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Mayo blinked.

&quot;Long story,&quot; Aoi gave her a gentle smile, her long
brown hair gleaming.

Mai punched one hand into the palm of the other, &quot;I&#39;ve
figured it out!&quot; As everyone looked at her she
continued, &quot;The reason I&#39;m not in Destiny is that I&#39;m
not a lesbian!&quot;

&quot;D&#39;oh!&quot;

&quot;Seriously,&quot; Mai continued, &quot;think about it! All the
major characters in Destiny had lesbian moments in
Hime. There&#39;s Shizuru and Natsuki...&quot;

&quot;Point,&quot; Shizuru murmured.

&quot;Chie and Aoi,&quot; Mai waved at them.

Aoi smirked as she took Chie&#39;s arm, &quot;I&#39;m surprised
more people didn&#39;t notice.&quot;

Mai finished up with, &quot;And Haruka and Yukino too.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re just friends,&quot; Haruka said stubbornly, the
blonde haired woman none the less keeping a possessive
hand on Yukino&#39;s arm.

&quot;Ah,&quot; Mayo smiled weakly, &quot;but I&#39;m not...&quot;

Mai shook her head as she said grimly, &quot;Don&#39;t try to
tell me that you and Shion Tennouji are just friends.&quot;

&quot;Well, you did kiss her hello,&quot; Natsuki remembered.

Mayo blushed, &quot;We&#39;re just childhood friends, really.&quot;

&quot;I mean, it&#39;s not fair,&quot; Mai waved her hands
dramatically, &quot;it&#39;s not like I can&#39;t be as good a
lesbian as anyone here!&quot;

With that Mai suddenly seized Mayo by the shoulders,
drawing the smallwer girl close. &quot;Eeep,&quot; Mayo barely
managed to get out before Mai kissed her.

With skills learned from several nights with Mikoto
that Mai had promised never to talk about Mai kissed
Mayo, drawing the moment out. Finally she drew back
and smiled as she asked the others, &quot;How was that?&quot;

&quot;Mimya...&quot; Mayo made a soft sound and fell over in a
dead faint.

&quot;I&#39;m impressed, Mai,&quot; Shizuru admitted, clapping
softly. &quot;Could you teach me that method so I can use
it on Natsuki?&quot;

&quot;Shizuru!&quot; Natsuki burst out.

&quot;She needs more training,&quot; Mai shook her head
mournfully, &quot;I was kissed by a girl in my first
episode and I didn&#39;t faint.&quot;

&quot;Ooooh...&quot; Mayo groaned as she came awake.

&quot;You mean you kissed a girl in your first episode,&quot;
Chie corrected wisely, &quot;that may have made a
difference.&quot;

&quot;It was CPR!&quot; Mai blurted, &quot;And an emergency!&quot;

&quot;Sure it was,&quot; Shizuru said with barely hidden
amusement.

Mayo was blushing as she sat up and said, &quot;I can&#39;t
believe you did that.&quot;

&quot;Mayo, are you all right?&quot; a new girl demanded,
hurrying over to her side and gently helping her stand
up.

&quot;I&#39;m all right, Shion,&quot; Mayo blushed shyly.

Shion Tennouji kept a firm grip on Mayo as she glared
at the others, &quot;What have you been doing to Mayo?&quot;

&quot;Still think they&#39;re just friends?&quot; Chie murmured.

Aoi smiled slightly, &quot;She&#39;s so fierce in defending
her, it must be true love.&quot;

Short hair kept neat with pins and her titanium framed
glasses gave Shion an intense quality as she swept the
group with her gaze, &quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;Mai was just demonstrating her lesbian qualities,&quot;
Natsuki decided to be truthful with her comrade, &quot;and
Mayo was a bit overwhelmed.&quot;

&quot;You did what?&quot; Shion looked more pissed, if that were
possible.

Mayo fixed Mai with a dangerous look as she said, &quot;And
I heard what you said about my needing more training.&quot;

&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Natsuki said, quickly waving everyone back,
&quot;she can be VERY powerful when she&#39;s pissed off.&quot;

&quot;Bring it on,&quot; Mai said as she summoned her element,
golden bands of fire dancing around both her wrists
and ankles.

&quot;Shion?&quot; Mayo put her hand on the other girl&#39;s arm.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Shion turned to her.

Gently Mayo drew her close, kissing Shion swiftly even
as she pressed their bodies close. Without thinking
about it Shion&#39;s arms moved to enclose Mayo, the sweet
kiss dragging out longer until both girls seperarted
with a gasp.

&quot;Oh Mayo,&quot; Shion gasped dreamily.

&quot;Still think I need training?&quot; Mayo met Mai&#39;s eyes
defiantly.

&quot;I&#39;d give that kiss a seven out of ten,&quot; Shizuru
agreed.

&quot;At least,&quot; Chie agreed, &quot;even if Shion didn&#39;t faint.&quot;

&quot;Shion&#39;s probably tougher than Mayo anyway,&quot; Haruka
shrugged.

&quot;Like Yukino&#39;s tougher than you at times?&quot; Aoi teased.

&quot;Shut up,&quot; Haruka scowled, blushing a bit.

&quot;Not bad,&quot; Mai conceded, &quot;you might just be a worthy
successor after all.&quot; She turned to Shizuru, &quot;Do me a
favor and keep an eye on things, would you?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Shizuru nodded gracefully.

&quot;And what will you do?&quot; Natsuki asked curiously.

&quot;Well, since Mikoto and I aren&#39;t in the series, we&#39;ve
moved in together,&quot; Mai explained. A faint blush
colored her cheeks, &quot;And now that we&#39;re alone, we&#39;re
doing lots of new things...&quot;

&quot;Too much information,&quot; Yukino blushed.</pre>
