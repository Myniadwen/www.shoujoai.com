Part one:

&quot;Eh, Shizuru,&quot; a dark haired girl called out.

&quot;Yes Natsuki?&quot; the tawny haired Kyoto-ben said as she twirled her finger 
around a dark strand.

Looking forward, while enjoying the feeling of fingers in her hair, 
Natsuki snuggled closer to Shizuru. They were both on the couch of 
Shizuru&#39;s apartment; this being was because Natsuki&#39;s apartment was 
under re-construction from an intense fire, caused by none other than 
the blue-haired ice queen herself. Nonetheless, Shizuru had her left arm 
wrapped around Natsuki&#39;s flat stomach, while her other hand was playing 
with the younger girl&#39;s hair. She was leaning comfortably against the 
armrest of her couch. Natsuki was being held captive, but didn&#39;t mind 
one bit, and was resting in the older girl&#39;s lap with her hand over 
lapping the older girl&#39;s hands.

&quot;I was wondering, have you ever gone camping?&quot; Natsuki asked innocently.

It was as if the world just stopped for Shizuru. The word &#39;camping&#39; just 
continued to echo in Shizuru&#39;s mind&#151;she was speechless.

Natsuki looked over her shoulder to she what Shizuru was doing, but came 
to see a normal, smiling face.

&quot;Camping? Ara, why does Natsuki ask such a question?&quot; Shizuru spoke 
calmly with a hint of fear that not even the best tone-detectors could 
detect.

Unconsciously, Natsuki laced her fingers with Shizuru&#39;s, while twirling 
a couple of strands of hair with her index finger on the other hand. 
Shizuru didn&#39;t know if Natsuki meant to do that or not, but in the end 
it was the same result&#151;Shizuru could feel her heart race and a thought 
rush through her head, &quot;Well, Mai told me about this camping park that 
was just established and I was wondering if you wanted to go with us. It 
would be a great experience,&quot; Natsuki&#39;s voice snapped Shizuru out of her 
train of naughty thoughts.

Taking a moment to try and recall what Natsuki just said, Shizuru looked 
towards the girl in her embrace and only thought of how many things she 
could do to her during this trip. &quot;Ara, since Natsuki wants me to attend 
this trip so badly, I just can&#39;t resist my Natsuki,&quot; Shizuru voiced with 
a hint of teasing in it. While this was happening, Shizuru allowed her 
other hand to slip from Natsuki&#39;s hair to slip around her stomach. Then, 
with gentle care, the hand slipped under Natsuki&#39;s shirt and traced 
circles of fire and ice on the younger girl&#39;s toned stomach.

With a sudden shudder, Natsuki became aware of where Shizuru&#39;s hand was 
and pushed into Shizuru even further. Shizuru smiled with satisfaction 
as Natsuki gasped. The dark haired girl was surprised by the way that 
she had acted. A blush was seen on her face, but she quickly got up, 
slipping through Shizuru&#39;s grasp, &quot;Umm... I&#39;m going to make some tea,&quot; 
Natsuki said as an excuse for the impulse she had to get up.

Shizuru looked up at her, feeling a lack of warmth. She smiled weakly, 
&quot;Yes, that would do me wonders,&quot; the taller girl lied.

------

As the teakettle started to sound, Natsuki went to it with two cups 
laced in her hands. She put the cups down and poured an even amount of 
water into the cups. Then she open a cabinet to her left and pulled out 
a box of teabags and withdrew two bags. Dunking both tea bags into each 
cup. She hung their strings over the edge of the cup and turned around, 
leaning against the counter table corner. She wrapped her arms around 
her waist and leaned her head down. At first she was thinking, then a 
frown formed on her face and a saddened expression appeared between the 
loose hairs that draped over her bent head. Why does Shizuru do these 
things to me? I told her that I liked her... But how much? I don&#39;t 
understand her... or myself. I liked it when she touched me. I mean, I 
let her do... more things to me... A blush erupted from her cheeks at 
the thought that had an dual meaning to it. Then a smile cracked over 
her face. I do treasure her and our relationship. But I just am not 
ready completely. She looked up with a new determination on her face as 
she turned to the teacups and pulled the tea bags from the cups and 
threw them into the nearby trashcan.

------

With steady hands, Natsuki walked through the kitchen door, over to the 
couch where Shizuru was waiting patiently. Natsuki set the teacup down 
in front of Shizuru and then landed a seat next to her with her cup in 
her hands.

Shizuru grabbed onto the cup and pulled it to her lips. She blew onto it 
slightly, but with full concentration. Then she would check the steam 
rate, another blow and then a sip. Shizuru delicately placed her lips 
onto the rim of the cup and tipped it up with the hand that was holding 
it from the bottom. Allowing steamy liquid to poor into her mouth, she 
then retracted the cup from her lips. Natsuki, whose lips were parted 
slightly, observed all this.

Shizuru, feeling the gaze of another, turned towards Natsuki, who wasn&#39;t 
paying attention fully, was caught staring. Shizuru thought that by 
looking back, Natsuki would blush and Shizuru would be pleased by that. 
However, Natsuki didn&#39;t catch on just yet and locked eyes with Shizuru, 
still with her lips slightly apart and her eyes slightly dimmed. Shizuru 
was the first to turn away with a small fade of red on her cheeks.

Natsuki snapped out of it, not really realizing what happened but she 
looked at Shizuru again, &quot;Oi, Shizuru, what are you doing?&quot; Natsuki 
leaded over towards the other girl.

Shizuru&#39;s blush deepened slightly, but it wasn&#39;t going away. &quot;Umm... I&#39;m 
looking at this great candle... Where did you get it? It smells of 
oranges. What a strong scent,&quot; Shizuru picked up a candle on the side 
table and focused on it intently.

Natsuki, actually catching on this time, &quot;Hmm... That one... Lemme see,&quot; 
Natsuki smirked slightly as she stood up and walked towards Shizuru.

Shizuru kept turning away from her, and handed the candle to her face. 
Natsuki taken aback by it, she grabbed it and the next thing she sees is 
Shizuru leaning over the couch. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Natsuki quirked a 
brow.

&quot;Have you never done this?&quot; Shizuru asked, &quot;It&#39;s loads of fun and it 
feels slightly good do be able to just relax,&quot; Why isn&#39;t my blush going 
away? What is wrong, Natsuki doesn&#39;t even blush for this long, the tawny 
haired girl thought.

Natsuki, determined to see what she thinks she sees, so she sat on the 
couch on her knees right next to Shizuru and leaned over. When she 
looked over to Shizuru, her face was turned, &quot;Hmm... This sorta works. 
But I always thought laying on the couch felt better,&quot; Natsuki said 
truthfully with pure innocence.

&quot;I&#39;ll take your advice,&quot; Shizuru spoke as she pushed off the edge of the 
couch and did a belly-flop onto the couch&#39;s cushions.

The dark haired girl looked at her. Not really understand what was wrong 
now. Does Shizuru not want to look at me because she&#39;s blushing? Or is 
there another reason? Natsuki decided to be a little rougher this time. 
She grabbed Shizuru gently and rolled her over. Because of this, the 
scene looked at like provocative from Shizuru&#39;s standpoint&#151;only making 
her blush start up again.

Natsuki was hovering over Shizuru with her right hand hold onto 
Shizuru&#39;s left arm. Natsuki was practically straddling Shizuru at the 
waist. Shizuru&#39;s hair was slightly messed up and her eyes were full, and 
so were her cheeks, full of red that is. She was looking up at Natsuki 
with a longing stare that had escaped through her barrier. Natsuki was 
about to try and make a &#39;Shizuru&#39; comment, but the words got stuck half 
way up her throat. She was stunned by the way Shizuru looked, and how 
lovely and helpless and sexy she looked.

It took the younger girl to realize what was wrong with her, but it was 
a little too late at this point, because Natsuki was already leaning 
down towards Shizuru&#39;s lips. Shizuru was shocked at this sudden action, 
and incase Natsuki was going to snap out of it, she didn&#39;t want to reach 
those lips. She would wait for them to reach hers.

Natsuki&#39;s mind was going crazy as she realized what she was doing. A 
loud voice was telling her to stop and pull away now before it was too 
late. But another voice, which was softer, but for some reason Natsuki 
could hear this voice better, was telling her to continue. That she 
really wanted this more than she gave credit too. This one time, she 
gave in to her unwanted desires.

She felt Shizuru&#39;s breathing; it hitched a few times because Natsuki was 
going agonizingly slow. She could feel the breaths hot and short. Then 
she only could feel the soft feeling of lips pressing against her own.

At first it was only a kiss but Shizuru, who was beginning to explode 
with desires, kicked it up a notch. She pushed up into Natsuki and was 
resting on her elbows. Natsuki retreated back for a gasp of air, but 
came back for more. Which surprised Shizuru slightly. Maybe she does 
feel the same way I feel for her. Shizuru thought happily. Then she 
shifted onto one of her elbows and her free hand slipped over Natsuki&#39;s 
mid-back. The hand slowly made its way to Natsuki&#39;s hair and then to the 
front of her face. Natsuki gasped slightly, but all would end soon, for 
a ringing sound came from the kitchen.

As both woke up from their lust, Natsuki jumped off of Shizuru and ran 
to the kitchen, even though a telephone was located closer to the couch.

-----

&quot;Hello,&quot; Natsuki answered the phone in a rather raspy voice.

&quot;Wow, Natsuki, is that you?&quot; The voice from the other line questioned.

As the dark-haired girl cleared her voice, &quot;Yes it&#39;s me! What do you 
want Mai?&quot; Natsuki asked in a rather harsh tone.

&quot;About the camping trip, are you going to come, I need to make 
reservations now otherwise it&#39;ll be all booked up,&quot; Mai spoke.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m coming, and so is Shizuru,&quot; Natsuki said with some 
uneasiness.

Mai hesitated for a second, but decided to not question Natsuki, &quot;Okay, 
I&#39;ll tell you when we can go tonight or tomorrow, okay? So just hang 
tight, kay?&quot; Mai said as a quick good-bye was exchanged and then a dial 
tone.

------

A click of the phone being hung up was all that Shizuru heard before she 
could hear footsteps coming back towards her. Shizuru was sitting 
straight up now, her hair slightly messed up, and her eyes in a daze. 
Natsuki didn&#39;t walk around the couch; she just stood behind the couch in 
silence.

Shizuru, snapping out of her daze, turned towards Natsuki, &quot;So when are 
we going on the camping trip?&quot; Shizuru asked with glee.

After seeing Shizuru looking at her in that state, Natsuki turned her 
head to the side with a major blush, she was remembering what had just 
happened. It was all just a blur really, but she knew she enjoyed it. 
That was the first time Natsuki had actually done anything like that. 
But she wasn&#39;t too sure if it would be the last.

Natsuki walked around the couch and sat down next to Shizuru. Natsuki&#39;s 
head was still facing a different direction.

&quot;Oi, Shizuru,&quot; Natsuki began, &quot;Listen, you I don&#39;t know what over came 
me, I&#39;m sorry if... I dunno,&quot; she tried to finish but it ended up not 
going out the same way it was in her brain.

Shizuru turned towards her right at the same time Natsuki looked at her, 
&quot;Natsuki, I love you,&quot; she spoke with love pouring out of her words.

Natsuki was taken aback, but soon she looked at Shizuru with a small 
smile, &quot;I.. l-love... You... too,&quot; the dark-haired girl stammered out 
with another bright blush erupting from her cheeks.

------

After a moments time, the ambiguously gay duo had to part ways. Natsuki 
had gotten a call from the landlord that her room was finished with its 
repairs and that she owed a pretty penny.

As Natsuki was standing outside of the door of Shizuru&#39;s apartment, she 
looked at the tawny-haired girl with happiness, &quot;Well, call me when Mai 
calls you about the camping, she most likely still thinks I&#39;m still 
here. Thanks for everything today,&quot; she looked down at her feet with 
embarrassment at the last comment.

Suddenly, she felt a soft feeling on her forehead, then she looked up to 
Shizuru, who had just kissed her, and the blush grew bigger. Then she 
turned and started off towards her motorbike.</pre>
