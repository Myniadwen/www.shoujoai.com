<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shoot me  again</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  problem with woodland stakeouts, the man in black thought, was that  you had to walk to them.  And the problem with being a sniper on a  woodland stakeout was that your gear was really fucking heavy.  Dressed in camouflage with his sleeves rolled up to perpetrate the  image of being a hiker, he carried a PSG-1 sniper rifle, a 64x zoom  scope, and two days worth of granola bars and water in an extremely  oversized backpack, covered with a tarp.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The tarp  itself was his own personal stakeout invention: The tarp was covered  in the same kind of paper that you peeled off of the edge of  stickers, because the tarp was itself a sticker.  In a pinch, he  could (and he had in the past) peel off the paper to reveal a layer  of glue, which he could essentially drag through the woods or desert  to pick up loose sand or foliage.  He could then hide under it for as  long as he needed to, provided he didn’t overheat or suffocate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another  one of those things he had used to cover his ass during the lazy  years.  It beat the hell out of booze, or it would have if he’d  actually let the tarp take the place of booze.  Not that a tarp could  really help loneliness like the booze had.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man  in camouflage with black underneath hiked through the night, with  only a flashlight and a GPS-equipped palm pilot to guide him to some  remote site that a certain asshole with a scratchy voice had decided  was the best point to observe what he could only ascertain was a  group of kids on a spring vacation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Oh,  how the mighty have fallen, </em>he thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">--</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  always dreamed.  Tonight was no different.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A  figure stands outside of the cabin, looking in at her.  She meets his  eye for a moment.  The figure is large and predatory, and she hears  more on their way.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>More  of what, though?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>More  monsters.  They’re everywhere.  The sand is alive with them. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>He  looks away. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“Kill  her.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  always dreamed.  Tonight was no different.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
In spite  of this, Chie woke rather comfortably, if slowly.  She was legendary  for her ability to remain asleep for an hour after she awoke, in  fact.  Eyes still closed, she yawned powerfully, sniffing the air and  finding it bearing the scent of rice and some sort of broth. She  sniffed again, decided it was miso broth, and smiled happily as only  the half-asleep could at something as simple, if delicious, as miso  broth.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All and  all, she was having a hell of a day, considering it was only about a  minute long.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then she  opened her eyes and found herself staring into cleavage that seemed,  at that half-delusional, groggy moment, to be about a mile wide.  She  half-yelped in alarm, and then restrained herself, forcing herself to  think clearly: <em>If this cabin has indeed been invaded by cleavage  monsters from the deepest pits of hell, </em>she thought, <em>the first  thing to do will not be to scream and wake what appears to be  sleeping.  Think clearly:</em> <em>If somebody is cooking outside,  there must be a knife out there, or some fire at least.  Cleavage  monsters fear fire, don’t they?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chie,  is it time to get up already?” the cleavage monster murmured, and  Chie froze.  This monster was devious: It sounded remarkably like her  close friend, Aoi Senou. <em>That clever bastard, </em>she cursed,  eyes never leaving her foe.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chie?”   the voice was a little clearer now.  “Um.  What are you looking  at?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe it <em>was </em>Aoi.  Maybe she had been captured by the  enemy?  She decided to risk speech.  “Don’t worry, Aoi.  I have  the enemy in my sights,” she said, her voice strangely muddled,  like somebody who was half-asleep.  “It doesn’t seem to be  moving; so long as it doesn’t move, we can figure out a way to get  you out of there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um,  Chie?  Are you okay?” Aoi’s voice was completely awake at this  point, and a little confused, a little worried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  worry about me. If you see your chance, run and warn the others.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  enemy shifted downwards, and Aoi’s face appeared; this time Chie  actually <em>did </em>yelp, shouting Aoi’s name in alarm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you sure you’re alright, Chie?” Aoi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie sat  up and observed Aoi, by herself, wearing a loose, white shirt, which  she was absently shifting upwards towards her neck to cover herself.  Chie blinked, shook her head, and shoved her dream away.  What<em> had </em>she dreamed about that had caused her to think that Aoi’s…that  Aoi had been a monster out to kill her?  “I’m good.  Sorry.  Must  have had a nightmare.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  I’m sorry,” Aoi said.  “Was it very bad?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  was…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>monster<br />
  kill  her</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  was awful.  I dreamt that your baby-feeders were coming to EAT ME!”  Chie shouted this last, and Aoi went beet-red.  “Bwargh! God,  they’re coming for me! Won’t somebody save me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">People  were beginning to awake at this, which was all right, in Chie’s  mind:  If breakfast was being served soon, then she was doing them a  favor by waking them all up before Mikoto, who was suspiciously  absent, ate it all.  Not that Chie herself would ever dream of doing  just such a thing.  Oh, no.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai,  too, was absent; she was probably cooking.  She had heard that Mai  was an excellent cook, though she’d never had the opportunity to  sample her culinary delights herself.  She supposed that this was to  change shortly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop  it, Chie!” Aoi half-squealed, going even redder, if possible. “Get  out of here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  will do no such thing. Not while the enemy still lurks nearby.”  She turned to Shizuru, who was rubbing her eyes calmly as she sat up.   “Get your hunting gear, Shizuru.  We’re going—” her stomach  loudly informed her that she would be sampling Mai’s culinary  delights <em>very </em>soon or she would be in very deep trouble with  several of the higher-ups.  “Whups.  Looks like I’m just going to  have to stick to foraging for now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  stood up, still in her pajamas, which consisted of a loose white  tee-shirt and panties (it was too hot for anything long), and slid  open the thick wooden and paper door separating them from the girls’  entryway, and found the source of the wonderful smells:  Out on the  beach, not ten meters off and clearly visible from where she stood,  somebody had built an old-fashioned campfire.  Hanging over it,  supported by a metal rod attached by two others to the ground, was a  pot full of miso.  The rice was next to it, already cooked.  It  smelled even better with the door open.  She imagined that anyone  else staying on that beachside lodge was going apeshit with hunger  about now.  Standing next to it, stirring it slowly, was Mai.  She  grinned, waved, and for a second, Chie thought she was the one being  waved at.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Until,  anyway, Tate walked out from the male side, waved back, stepped out  the door without his shoes.  He realized he was missing them about  three steps later as the hot sand burned his feet, and he whirled  around and went back for the cabin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Unfortunately,  with the door open, it was entirely possible for him to observe Chie  standing there in a tee-shirt and panties.  And as he looked up from  putting his shoes on, he did just that.  He went instantly red, and  Chie half-shrieked as her hands flew to cover her legs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiho  moved so quickly that it was barely possible to observe her:  Apparently standing behind Chie, also summoned by the scent of food,  Shiho’s eyes locked onto her “Big brother” as his locked onto  the copious amount of slim, white leg Chie was flashing at him;  enraged, emboldened, or perhaps simply stupid, tearing off towards  him at full tilt, her own baggy tee-shirt flaring out behind her; a  solid leap, with intent to kill, and then the two of them were  falling.  Tate caught the brunt of it; he landed more than half off  of the platform and fell down three steps into the burning sand that  he had been running to escape; Shiho simply bounced onto his head,  and there was a good two-second delay between the time she did and  the time her tee-shirt settled back firmly on her torso.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If it  was possible for Tate to be any more red, the probability of such an  event could only have been described using abstract mathematics.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just <em>what</em> were you staring at?” Shiho demanded as the dust  settled around Tate’s head.  When she was referring to, he wasn’t  certain; to be fair, at that point, he was certain of only two  things:  His head hurt, a lot; and he was completely unable to speak.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…I  wa…I buh…bu…lu…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  laughed from her vantage point.  “He was staring at my hot legs,  Shiho!” she shouted at her.  “They’re completely irresistible!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  didn’t help; Shiho knocked Tate’s already aching head with the  flat of her palm, and he groaned.  “Let up, Shiho.  My head is  killing me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’d  best get off of your big brother,” Reito said from the doorway to  the men’s bedroom.  “Otherwise, he’s probably going to die of  heat stroke down there.  I’m sure he didn’t mean anything by it,  did you, Tate?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tate  sputtered for a moment.  “I…uh…no, I didn’t.  Of course I  didn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiho  stared at him with eyes that could kill given were they given  appendages of any sort for a moment, and he gave her his most winning  smile.  Which, to be fair, was saying very little when the back of  his neck was in searing pain as he spoke.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine,”  she grumbled, and got off of him. He sat up faster than anyone Chie  had ever seen before, and after a moment of what could only have been  consideration, took off for the ocean, screaming, “HOT!” all the  way.  Reito, fully dressed in swimming trunks and a tasteful Hawaiian  shirt, walked out towards where Mai and Mikoto were cooking, turning  back only to grin a little at Chie, informing her gently that she was  still standing there in her panties. As he did this, Shiho marched  past Chie, giving her the glaring of her life, in Shiho’s opinion.  Chie would have thought her opinion was vastly overrated, if she had  been thinking about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  wasn’t.  Her eyes were locked onto Reito’s, and for a second, she  felt as though she was in a trance, unable to look away.  His eyes  were neutral and level, and hers were too, but still, something…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>monster<br />
  kill<br />
  eye</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">wasn’t  right in her mind.  Maybe she was just hungry.  Either way it wasn’t  a feeling she wholly enjoyed.  As soon as he turned from her, she did  the same, stepping back into the room as quickly as her dignity would  allow, suddenly a little pale.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi, who  had been up until now watching the entire endeavor, looked at her  with some concern.  “Are you <em>sure </em>you’re okay?” she  asked one more time.  “You look really pale.  Are you running a  temperature?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  instinctively placed the palm of her hand on her forehead, finding it  cool as it ever was; Chie’s circulation wasn’t great anyway.  “I’m fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi  placed her hand on Chie’s forehead anyway, and Chie leaned into it,  suddenly tired all over again.  “Can’t I just go back to sleep? I  was having such a good day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?  What’s wrong now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  is wrong?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Nothing  I saw in Reito’s eyes scared me. He’s a handsome, generally  uninterested male that does more or less nothing for or to me.  But  something I saw</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>monster<br />
  kill<br />
  eye<br />
  sand</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>in…was  it in my dream?  I don’t remember.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  stomach informed her more insistently that time that if she didn’t  hustle and get some food, it was going to start gnawing at her colon.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Forget  about it.  Your cleavage just scared me is all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My…”  Aoi sputtered a bit, covering the neck of her shirt unnecessarily.  “What are you on about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  shook her head, looked outside at the</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">s<em>and </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">ocean  again.  It was too nice of a day to spoil just because a cute guy saw  her panties. <em>Even if he is Mai’s.  Sort of. </em>She grinned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  told you before! Your baby-feeders are out to EAT ME!” She tackled  Aoi into her sleeping bag and laughed, and after a few seconds, Aoi  laughed too.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The man  in black reached his “perfect sniping position” just as the sun  was peeking above the horizon, trying to decide if today was going to  be just another day, or the long-feared day of eternal night like all  the doomsday screamers had been predicting for years. Finding that  the sky was still blue, the grass was still green in a few parts of  the world, Enrique Iglesias was still in the closet, and there were  still a few people smiling and a few people shitting, it decided to  allow the human race another day on its planet.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was another man in black waiting for him, except this man in black  was actually a man in green camouflage.  Like him, but he bet this  guy didn’t have a black suit underneath.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Howdy,”  he nodded to the other man, who didn’t look up.  The other man was  holding a G3A3 sniper rifle with the largest scope the man in black  had ever seen, aiming it at the cabin where his targets were staying.   “What a wonderful day to lay around in the grass pointing guns at  kids, eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man  in green still didn’t look up.  “Are you Minoru Alder?” he  asked.  His voice was a little dry, a little scratchy, like he hadn’t  had anything to drink all day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  Alder, the man in black, nodded.  “And you must be Nori Ikimasu.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm.  Orders are only to observe today. You go over to the other hill and  keep an eye on the girls’ cabin. Make verbal notes every time you  see anything happen, and don’t forget to report in every  half-hour.”  Nori pointed off down (and back up) a bitch of a hill  that Minoru had already braved to get there, and Minoru’s face  fell.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine.” <em>He didn’t even volunteer to watch the girls’ cabin.  He must  be a eunuch. </em>He set off back down the hill, trudged up the hill,  laid down, and opened his backpack. It took him a minute and a half  to set up all of his gear: Weapon, stand, food, drink, and emergency  tarp.  He could have opened it up and dragged it, but what was the  point?  It wasn’t like these kids were dangerous. Besides, then  he’d have to order a new one from his storage facility in America,  and that was plenty expensive.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  closed his left eye and looked with his right into his  not-unimpressive (though certainly wimpy next to Nori’s) scope and  into the window of the girls’ bedroom.  They were all asleep, all  eight of them, all fully clothed, no sexy pillow fights or erotic  games of spin-the-bottle in sight. <em>Another eternal mystery  solved, </em>he thought with a touch of misogynistic humor. <em>Damn. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  door slid open, and an orange-haired girl walked in sleepily, rubbing  her eyes, and left his field of view, what little he had from the  window. <em>Ooh, </em>he thought half-heartedly.<em> Where was </em>she <em>coming from?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Probably  the bathroom, you fuckwit letch. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  sighed, another fantasy ruined by his own ability to reason, and  grabbed a granola bar.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">By the  time Tate managed to soak his neck in the cool ocean water, he was  thoroughly bored.</span></p>
