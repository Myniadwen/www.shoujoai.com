<h1>It Doesn't Matter</h1>

<pre>The sun shone. In fact it shone down brightly as it had done all June. 
And of course, tomorrow it would shine as well. Though, tomorrow it 
would be the last day for some of the students to see its bright gleam 
being cast down on the campus.

Natsuki lazed on her favourite spot of Fuuka Academy, a hill a little 
aside from the rest of the life on the campus as it was shielded by the 
forest. Here, where there were no students bustling about and no 
teachers telling you to do your homework and study, it was quiet. Yes, 
quiet and tranquil, and that&#39;s why Natsuki liked to be here. Whenever 
her heart had been in turmoil, which had been the fact quite often in 
her school years, she had come to a place like this. She hadn&#39;t been 
looking for a special place, but rather a special atmosphere. A 
tranquillity to surround her, to engulf her and to render serenity to 
her troubled heart. On the academy grounds she had found such a place 
right here and today she had visited it one more time.

While she had been sitting in the soft grass, staring off into the 
distance, the sun had turned from pure white to warm yellow to the 
colour of melted gold, now basking the scenery and its sole inhabitant 
in a warm glow.

&#39;Tomorrow is the last day.&#39;

The thought had popped up every so often in her mind that afternoon and 
every time she had brushed it aside as quickly as it had appeared. She 
didn&#39;t want to think of tomorrow, she&#39;d come here to forget about it. 
For a while at least.

Natsuki closed her eyes and held her face directly into the rays of the 
sinking sun, allowing the warmth to grace her features. 
A soft voice announced the presence of another person behind her.

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be in your room preparing yourself for tomorrow?&quot;, the 
voice behind her back asked with mild curiosity.

Natsuki didn&#39;t move nor open her eyes to the intruder in her little 
peaceful idyll.

&quot;Well, you seem to have expected me here, otherwise you wouldn&#39;t have 
come,&quot; she simply retorted.

&quot;What tells you that I haven&#39;t been running around the whole school, 
looking anxiously for you everywhere before and getting more and nervous 
about you?&quot; the voice asked with hurt and reproach.

Natsuki smiled to herself. She knew it was only faked. 
&quot;Because I know you know me, Shizuru, and I&#39;m not falling for those 
little games anymore.&quot; Natsuki pointed out. &#39;At least, not as easily as 
I did in former times.&#39; she added in her head.

&quot;Well, then it seems my Natsuki has known me for too long, if I start to 
bore her.&quot; Shizuru replied, forging disappointment.

&quot;Don&#39;t say such a thing!&quot; Natsuki got a little harsh. No matter for how 
long she knew her friend and those games and teasing of her, up to now 
she hadn&#39;t been able to build up an immunity against them. But maybe, 
she mused, it didn&#39;t matter because it was one of the pillars her 
relationship had been constructed on.

&quot;Come here already and stop it, Shizuru.&quot; she said in a commanding tone.

&quot;Whatever Natsuki wishes,&quot; Shizuru answered lightly, approaching her 
friend and sitting down right next to her in one graceful, fluent 
motion.

She regarded her love&#39;s face. It had indeed changed a lot over the past 
years at university, she thought. The ever present frown of the teenage 
girl she had met ages ago was gone. The young women beside her, enjoying 
the sunshine on her face, was comfortable with herself. Her eyes were 
still closed and her muscles slack, no tension or anxiety anywhere in 
her features. She didn&#39;t flinch or move when Shizuru trailed a hand up 
her back and caught a few lose strands of her black hair. All Natsuki 
did was tilt her head a little, leaning it against Shizuru&#39;s shoulder, 
as the woman kept playing with her hair, twisting it around her fingers.

&quot;Did you learn your speech?&quot; Shizuru asked after a while, stirring her 
love out of the drowsiness invading her mind and body.

&quot;Yeah, yeah, I know it by heart. Satisfied?&quot; she mumbled, unwilling to 
change the slightest thing about the cosiness of the situation right 
now.

&quot;Are you sure? It would be very embarrassing if the chosen speaker for 
the graduation ceremony messed up, you know.&quot; Shizuru couldn&#39;t help but 
to tease a bit and tipped her index finger on Natsuki&#39;s nose. The girl 
just gave a grunt as a reply and cringed her nose at the contact. 
Creaking one eye open to get a vision, she playfully snapped at the 
finger, eliciting a giggle from her friend. Natsuki nuzzled a bit closer 
and Shizuru in return placed her arm round her waist to hold her close.

&quot;You&#39;ve changed.&quot; Natsuki said. &quot;In the past you would have never 
giggled.&quot;

Shizuru&#39;s lips spread to a smile at that comment. It presented yet 
another great opportunity to tease her friend, but she decided to keep 
it serious for once in a while. Instead of some perky remark, she 
answered, &quot;I was thinking that same of you earlier.&quot;

They both went silent again.

What use was it to dig up the old stories? 
They both had known each other for years; they knew what troubles they 
had gone through, the troubles they had to overcome before they ended up 
together as well as the little annoyances their relationship had had to 
face along the years. 
There would have been no meaning in telling them all over. They had made 
it this far and according to their future plans it was to continue. 
Maybe a year, maybe five years, maybe even more. At best they could hope 
for a lifetime.

Right at the moment they were here, with each other and content. How 
they got there was not of much importance.

&quot;Guess I should say thank you.&quot; Natsuki&#39;s voice broke the silence.

&quot;What for? For writing your speech?&quot; the brunette chuckled. &quot;I couldn&#39;t 
let you embarrass yourself in front of everyone.&quot; Shizuru knew that it 
wasn&#39;t what her love had meant. If it had been something that simple she 
wouldn&#39;t have mumbled it with averted eyes.

&quot;No, baka!&quot; the girl in her arms retorted, jerking her head up.

&quot;No,&quot; she continued more calmly, this time looking Shizuru straight into 
the face. &quot;I mean thanks for...for everything, I guess.&quot; Natsuki cursed 
herself inwardly. That had sounded pretty lame to her own ears, though 
Shizuru didn&#39;t seem to mind as she was still smiling fondly at her. 
Natsuki drew in another breath and averted her eyes again, locking them 
on the next best thing, which came to be their hands. Unconsciously she 
had entwined one of her hands with one of Shizuru&#39;s, playing with their 
fingers. Shizuru knew her blue haired beauty well. Actions such as these 
were always a sign of insecurity. She lifted her hand from her love&#39;s 
hip and stroked her head as if calming down an upset child. Meanwhile 
Natsuki wrestled with herself, or rather her tongue. After years of 
being lovers she should have no problem at all talking about her 
feelings, she scolded herself, yet she did. It wasn&#39;t that she was 
embarrassed or uncomfortable with loving the woman holding her. She 
loved her with all her heart. But she never found quite the right words 
to voice it. Of course, she contemplated, Shizuru knew for what she had 
wanted to thank her even if she did not elaborate it, but the fact was 
she wanted to. Skimming through her university years this afternoon had 
also been reviewing her relationship with Shizuru and to her dislike she 
had detected that far too often for her personal liking she had avoided 
telling her love what she still was: her most important person.

Not that Shizuru would demand it from her, she&#39; never done it once, but 
sometimes even the emotionally-dense Natsuki caught a glimpse of longing 
in her eyes, which she was determined not to seal away with a kiss 
today.

The hand stroking her hair helped, sort of. It indicated safety, 
provided by their own little world surrounding them right now. They were 
alone. No matter how mushy, cheesy and stuttered her words might be, 
only Shizuru would hear them.

Natsuki placed a kiss on their fingers, reassuring herself that the 
proper words would come out of her mouth. 
&quot;Thanks for becoming my friend when I had none, for not giving up trying 
no matter how harsh I was. Thanks for helping me through high school and 
getting me into university, for sacrificing your own study time to help 
me with my exams. Thanks for covering for me whenever I skipped and for 
stopping me skipping. Thanks for nursing me when I was sick, for 
watching over me getting healthy food, washing my clothes, helping me to 
keep our apartment clean. Thanks for believing in me all the time, even 
when I would give up on myself.

Thank you for loving me, Shizuru.&quot;

Once she had opened her mouth the words had spilled forward. Bottled up 
for a long time, what she had always felt and never quite said had come 
forth, without a pause or a particular order. An onslaught of sentences 
finally breaking the barrage, flowing on and on undamped for as long as 
her breath lasted. Now that the flood had ceased, she shuffled around in 
the woman&#39;s arms so that she came to lie facing her and looked up. 
Shizuru stared down at her, her eyes locked on her princess, tears 
streaming freely down her face, over her cheeks, and along her jaw line 
to drip down in her lap. Her make-up, otherwise indiscernible, ran over 
her face along with the tears, leaving tracks on her otherwise flawless 
cheeks.

It wasn&#39;t the picture Natsuki had expected to see. And though she would 
have deemed it corny to say Shizuru had never looked more beautiful, to 
Natsuki she was gorgeous at that moment.

It didn&#39;t matter that her make-up was being washed away, or that the 
tears stained her cheeks, all Natsuki could see was the smile blooming 
on Shizuru&#39;s face. While the droplets were spilling forth, her eyes were 
shining and her lips spreading in a smile. It was open and unguarded, a 
rare expression on the Fujino face that offered a polite smile to 
everyone. And it was sincere and therefore genuine to Natsuki.

After she had marvelled at the sight for some time, she tentatively 
brought a finger up to her beloved&#39;s face to brush away the tears. 
Instead of her intention though, the blue haired woman found herself 
tracing along the lines they had left. &quot;Shizuru,&quot; she whispered softly.

When she brought her lips up to Shizuru&#39;s she could taste the salt on 
her lips. The pair of arms around her back was pressing her into 
Shizuru, digging the fingers into the fabric of her shirt. It was an 
intense embrace, almost furious. For the first time, Natsuki realized, 
Shizuru was clinging to her and she the one holding her. Shizuru was 
begging for her words to be true and Natsuki was reassuring her that she 
meant them.

Mentally, though, she kicked herself. If she had known how happy she 
could make her love with those simple words, and simple they had been 
after all, she thought, then she would have said them way earlier.

As their kiss ended Natsuki looked into Shizuru&#39;s eyes. &quot;Will you help 
getting me through whatever job I&#39;m going to pick, too?&quot; she asked in a 
whisper.

&quot;I will.&quot; Shizuru answered, again with that smile gracing her features.

&quot;Then it&#39;s a promise.&quot; She said, pulling Shizuru in a tight embrace.
