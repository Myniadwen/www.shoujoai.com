<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It recently came to my attention that Tate Yuuichi is actually the  formal Japanese version of the name, and that his first name is, in  fact, Yuuichi.  This is my mistake, and I’ll start working on  correcting it, so don’t worry about it.  I’m starting this  chapter the proper way.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally,  Midori’s character wasn’t very well-developed in the Anime, so  I’m relying on the manga in this chapter, more than is probably  generally acceptable.  It’ll be okay though; promise.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And I  know as stillness shatters / we have all been frightened by the sound  of / footsteps on the pavement of our lives</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I stand  and fight / I’m not afraid to die / Elochai / bury me tonight</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Please  believe me / that the world deceives me / don’t stand me up just /  leave me / I have fallen again / this is the end</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">--</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Pain  redefined</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  inhaled deeply as she awoke; the simple breath continued into a gasp,  as many first breaths do, as she opened her eyes and found herself  staring at one of her captors.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man  was tall and his eyes were dark, but there was no rugged handsomeness  to add to this description.  Maybe he had been handsome once, but  whatever was left of it was gone.  Consumed by something; by what,  she didn’t know.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  wasn’t particularly sure she wanted to find out, either.  He  advanced on her, and looked her straight in the eye, and for a  moment, she was sure he was going to slap her or rape her.  She  wasn’t sure which, yet.  His face was angry, but his eyes were not.   What this meant, she also wasn’t sure of.  Again, she wasn’t  sure she wanted to find out, either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  will only be held by us until the end of the day,” he said.  His  voice was as rugged as his face, but more pleasant; it was the voice  of a loving father, a gentle man.  His face told of something colder;  of, perhaps, the fate of those consigned to the role of sacrificial  lambs to the recession.  “After that, you will be passed off to  another party, who will do with you what he chooses. You have no  choice in this matter.  Please do not attempt to struggle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was a certain pleading in the way he said please. Like he was saying  it to his dog as he killed it rather than face starvation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t take any particular comfort from this thought.  It seemed  far too accurate for her tastes.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It’s  a good thing they’re not holding her in a shack, or I might  accidentally kill her too.  As it is, the barn they’re holding her  seems like a perfect location for them to hole themselves up in, but  in reality, it’s just their mausoleum.  They just don’t know it  yet.</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’ll  show them the light, though.  Oh yes, yes I will.  I haven’t felt  this charged since the carnival ended.  This almost feels </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">good</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>necessary. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m  driving the van by myself because I don’t want to endanger Reito  and Midori.  They’re off finding the others, gathering them up.  Also, I want to do this by myself.  I have plenty of ammunition, and  I’ve probably got a better eye than any of these bastards, trained  ex-First District agents or not.  I’ll show them the light. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Oh  yes, I will.  I crash the van through the door and grind it to a  screeching halt, taking three of them off-guard, crushing a fourth  who was foolishly trying to guard that ex-door.  The ones taken  off-guard I gun down first, my Desert Eagle chewing holes in them  large enough to drive a conversion van through.  A convenient  metaphor, or simply observation? Hmm.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  rest are already in support positions on the upper floor of the barn.   They think they’ve got good cover, but I also have a Desert Eagle,  which eats wood and flesh without discrimination.  Bullets </em>spang <em>off of the car, shatter windows, and one grazes my shoulder, but  that’s as far as they get.  One by one, one-shot-one-kill, they  jerk and lay still, guns dropping to the floor. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  there is Shizuru, straight ahead of me, tied to a chair, the van’s  headlights enveloping her in a kind of radiant aura.  Perfect for her</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ascent  to heaven her head is in pieces on her blouse and the floor behind  her dress is torn and ripped her thighs bruised oh god what have they  done oh god what have <em>I </em>done what am I going to</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do?”  Midori asked poking at Natsuki with one her index finger as the van  ate up the highway at a fairly steady 55 miles per hour.  Natsuki  would have liked it to go faster, but Reito insisted to her that they  would lose far more time getting pulled over than they would by  slowing down 5 MPH.  Midori wanted to gun it, too, but Reito insisted  to <em>her </em>that she was far too inebriated to drive.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  blinked, coming back to reality, and shook her head, trying to  dislodge the image of Shizuru<br />
      <em>pieces<br />
        bruised<br />
        fucked</em><br />
  and  her gruesome, though wholly <em>fictional, </em>state, from her head,  where it stubbornly lingered.  “What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  said,” Midori repeated in a slow voice that could have easily been  mistaken as condescension, but that Natsuki knew for a fact to  possess roots in the muddy pits of alcohol.  “What exactly are you  planning to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  shook her head.  “I’m not quite sure yet, but I do know that I’ll  feel a lot more comfortable doing whatever I’m doing with my gun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  idea. At all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  have a few, but they don’t concern you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  actually took quite a bit of offense at this: “Oh, really.  And  this is why exactly? Because we’re not the kind of people you’d  like to have at your back, or because you just don’t want anybody  on your back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  remained silent, and Reito cleared his throat.  It took Midori about  thirty seconds to understand that Natsuki was actually a little hurt.  This irritated Midori, but not more than it made her feel guilty.  “I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  frowned.  “You know why I can’t let you two help me. Midori,  you’re not used to fighting without your Element and your Child,  and Reito…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can  take care of myself,” Reito said quietly.  “But I’ve never  fired a gun before, so I understand.  This is serious, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  it’s what I think it is, then it’s <em>very </em>serious.  I’m  not even sure <em>I </em>want to get in on it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  you have to, because Shizuru’s gone.” Natsuki frowned again, a  little angry at the presumption: This was excusable, in her mind,  only because Midori was drunk. Just how drunk, Natsuki was starting  to question.  She was remarkably lucid for a boozie.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  have to, end of story.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  started to argue back, but Reito silenced her by speaking more  clearly.  “We’ll help you in any way we can, Natsuki. If that  means storming the castle with all guns blazing, so be it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  doesn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  we’ll do whatever you need us to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  nodded in acknowledgement as they pulled up to the parking lot.  “You  two wait here; I’ll be back in a minute. Reito, try and call  everybody and tell them…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  studied her face for a moment, saw the conflicting emotions there.  On the one hand, he had the old, lone-wolf Natsuki, who didn’t want  anybody to know anything about what was going on in her life.  That  Natsuki probably wanted Reito to tell everybody something like,  “Could you please postpone Karaoke for about an hour? Midori got  drunk and we’ve got to bring her home.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">On the  other hand, he had the Natsuki who was a close friend of Mai Tokiha.  The one who was gradually coming to understand what it was like to  operate not just in a group, but in a group of friends.  The Natsuki  who actually attended lunch with Mai, Yukino, and Yuuichi on  occasion, who visited Mai at work, who watched Yuuichi and Reito spar  during club when she had nothing else to do.  The Natsuki who  attended school regularly, and occasionally, when she thought that  absolutely nobody was looking, glanced at Takeda, the captain of the  kendo club; whether this was to make sure that he wasn’t sneaking  glances at her or for some other reason, he honestly had no idea; but  it was a sign of some kind of fundamental change occurring within  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Of  course, she also still carried a gun around.  Guns were illegal in  Japan, so this was nothing to scoff at.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So when  he observed her face now, so conflicted, fighting a battle against  none other than itself, he made a decision that he didn’t know if  she could make for herself.  “I’ll let everybody know that we  can’t find Shizuru, but that they shouldn’t worry, because you  and I and Midori are out looking for her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  nodded her thanks, relief playing onto her face only briefly before  giving way to a deadpan that genuinely frightened Reito.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  seemed to be sobering at this point: “In the meantime, we’ll go  to the police and tell them that—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>No!</em>”  Natsuki snapped. “The police are the <em>last </em>place you want to  go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  if what I think is happening is happening, they’ll have been the  first people infiltrated.  If what I think is happening <em>isn’t </em>happening, then Shizuru is in no danger, and she’ll turn up  eventually, with…” <em>Tear-streaked eyes? A heavy heart? An  unwillingness to look at me?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With  what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  damages.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  didn’t believe it, but her gradually returning sobriety—she  hadn’t really imbibed that much alcohol, after all, and she was  starting to feel her heart beat faster as she became moderately more  afraid; the adrenaline dissolved the alcohol relatively quickly—told  her to keep her mouth shut about it, so she did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Reito  and I are going to scout out places in the town that we could use in  case it <em>is </em>whatever you think it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Places  like what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Places  with people we can trust.  If there’s been an infiltration into the  police department, people will have been fired, or at least paid off,  right? And whenever that happens, people will be talking. Sometimes  it takes a few drinks to get them to talk, but they’ll talk anyway.  Small towns like this always talk.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  starting to sound a lot like Chie,” Reito said, but he was  grinning, and so was Natsuki.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Not  Chie.  Somebody else…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Not  thinking about that. Having a good time on vacation, or possibly  saving Shizuru from certain doom, but not thinking about that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  learned it on the road,” she grinned brightly, the polar opposite  of what she felt, suddenly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  nodded to them both and got out of the car, and as she slammed the  door, Reito said, “Oh yeah, you went off artifact-hunting with that  professor, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  nodded with a small, moderately somber smile, looking down at the  dry-brown purple of the fabric she sat on.  This was female-speak for <em>Shut up. </em>Reito knew this quite well, so he laid off, and for  a few moments, there was silence between the two of them. It was at  least moderately awkward. This really bothered Reito.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,”  he said, forcing his tone to be something other than an  awkward-silence-breaking-small-talk tone. “What have you decided to  study at –”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop,”  she said in a quiet voice.  She leaned against the window of the van,  closing her eyes.  “I’m very sorry, but please just stop. I want  none of what you’re offering, Reito.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not offering anything,” Reito said, a little annoyed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  you don’t need to talk about it,” Midori said.  “Please. Just  don’t talk for a while.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  frowned.  “Are you okay, Midori?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shrugged.  “Are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  grinned at that.  “Why wouldn’t I be?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  could think of a few reasons, but I don’t need to bring any of them  up if you’ll give me some time to my own head.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  what good do you think that’s going to do you?”  he growled.  “Brooding does nobody<em> any </em>good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  time, instead of thinking it, Midori snapped and practically shouted  it.  “You just. Don’t. <em>Get it, </em>you snide <em>fuck!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This,  Reito took in stride, with a grin.  “I hope someday you’ll  explain it to me.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  purple-haired girl was making for the cabin. Nori Ikimasu followed  her with his weapon’s scope.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">From the  window, he watched her opening her bag.  She pulled out…something…he  couldn’t see what it was; only the glint of black metal.  It looked  a little like a gun, but Nori was not imaginative enough to allow  himself to be swayed that easily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  surprised him, however, when she started testing the sights of the  gun she was apparently holding.  Surprised him enough that his finger  twitched on the trigger a little, in reflex, as she pointed it in his  general direction. This was sheer reflex, however, as he was a good  sniper, and he had learned long ago not to shoot anybody reflexively  unless they gave him a good reason for it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Perhaps  if his finger had not been so twitchy, everything that transpired  thereafter would never have occurred, but the shadow doubted it.  The  shadow was really, though he hesitated to admit it, just looking for  an excuse to kill the man who was pointing down with a large sniper  rifle at the cabin of people she called <em>her friends.</em> Eventually, she probably would have just killed him out of a kind of  preemptive-strike instinct.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Either  way, Nori Ikimasu died a second after his finger twitched as the  shadow, moving with practiced silence and agility, leapt down from  his spot on the treebranch above the sniper, and landed with his feet  on either side of the man’s torso.  In the same motion in which she  bent her knees to absorb the shock, she also plunged her  double-bladed knife—which she had made herself after her old one  had disappeared—into Nori Ikimasu’s spinal cord, severing it in a  single stroke to prevent any sort of reflexive action.  (such as  pulling the trigger).  He died without any clue what killed him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  hardest thing for young warriors to remember, however, is to consider  their surroundings to their fullest.  Young warriors—shadows  included—are often at least a little brash, assuming that once they  kill their target, their job is over, because they will be able to  fade before any sort of alarm could be properly raised.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What  this particular shadow failed to consider was the fact that Nori  Ikimasu was on a hill with a very heavy weapon with a heavier scope.  The weapon dropped out of his limp fingers—one of the benefits of  severing the spinal cord as a mode of death was the total body  relaxation it entailed, as all of the nerve stems received no final  orders and all of the tendons relaxed as they ran out of energy  provided by said spinal cord—and bounced down the fifteen yard  slope.  The shadow cursed, but supposed it made no real difference in  the end.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The fact  that Natsuki started shooting at her <em>immediately </em>was kind of  annoying, though.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Natsuki  fired one half of her clip at nothing at all before something burst  through the window, knocking the gun out of her hand and throwing her  to the ground.  For one blind second, she thought, <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">ninja</span></em>.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For  another second, she thought, <em>that’s absurd. There are no Ninja  left in Japan.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then,  as her eyes focused on the ninja standing in front of her, she  reconsidered yet again, opting for a third option of <em>what the fuck </em>is <em>that?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  hazarded a guess, using her past experience to guide her, and prayed  she wasn’t wrong and that if she was, she developed superhuman  speed to avoid being killed by the nasty-looking knife at the ninja’s  side.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Akira?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  ninja nodded and pulled off her black facemask to reveal the  pleasantly masculine, yet still overtly feminine, face of Akira  Onuzaki, Ninja.  She blinked a moment before she became lucid enough  to say, “I take it that that ninja outfit was not just something  you did for show as a HiME.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akira  grinned a little humorlessly. “You take it correctly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  won’t ask.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akira  grinned and offered her hand to Natsuki, who took it and allowed the  surprisingly strong little girl to help her up.  After she balanced  herself, she went to where her gun had fallen, picked it up, dusted  it off, safetied it, and started sifting through her bag again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can I  ask what you’re doing with an illegal…” she paused to take in  the sheer magnitude of the semi-automatic handgun that Natsuki seemed  to have obtained.  “Ah…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“An  illegal howitzer. I think that’s the word you’re looking for.  I  got it off of one of my contacts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  you did this why, exactly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  sighed, stopped rummaging, and steeled herself so that she wouldn’t  sound as unbalanced as she felt when she explained it to Akira.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Midori  really wanted to smack Reito—the little shit just never gave
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Six  gunshots in extremely rapid succession. Loud ones, the kind that  positively </em>scream<em> “Don’t </em>fuck <em>with me, I’ve got a  freaking hand cannon right here.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Up?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  jerked in panic and his head rotated something near 180 degrees as he  whirled around to look for the source of the gunshots.  After  remaining in that state—<em>he looks like the girl from the  exorcist, </em>Midori thought—for a solid three seconds, his torso  whirls around to make him not-ethereal again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This, of  course, was an exaggeration of Midori’s mind, but he <em>did </em>panic  pretty hard.  That wasn’t to say that Midori didn’t as well, but  still.  She actually jumped and let out a little yelp, and in the  process banged her head on the roof of the car.  She sat there while  Reito stared out into the untelling woods behind the cabin,  positively determined to spot the invading army that was most  certainly coming to kill them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Owowowowow…son  of a </em>bitch. For the second time that day, Midori violently cursed  herself; her</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>immaturity</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">panicked  reaction, her lack of a clear head.  She wished desperately that she  hadn’t drunk nearly as much as she had, and at the same time  desired—in ways that couldn’t have been entirely proper—a  bottle of beer.  Or something harder.  She found that she was  actually shaking. Really, really hard, in fact.  If there really was  somebody that was coming to kill them—all of them, starting with  Natsuki and Shizuru and working their way down the guest list—and  they’d already gotten to Natsuki down there, what could <em>she </em>possibly do?  She had <em>no </em>weapons; <em>no </em>experience  fighting with anything but her Element.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For the  first time, Midori became acutely aware of the fact that she could no  longer fight as she had been able to last year.  She was no longer a  HiME; she could no longer leap yards into the air, summon Gakutenou,  and slice an enemy to ribbons.  She no longer had <em>protection; </em>no longer had the kind of power that gave her a one-up on regular  people.  As she realized this; that a single man with a single gun  could now kill both her <em>and </em>Reito with very little trouble,  she began to shake violently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was utter complete silence in the van as the echoes of the gunshots—a  torrential wind pounding on a microphone connected to speakers whose  volume was in constant flux—slowly died out.  It was amazing how  long those things lasted.  The tension only fed Midori’s sudden,  pounding sense of fear; fear that somebody, in any instant, could put  a gun to the window of their van and gun them both down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She had  really thought that <em>that </em>would make her immune to the fear of  death.  In reality, it only made it stronger in her, more prevalent.  As she felt her arms wrapping themselves around her shoulders,  though, and she felt her knees draw themselves up to her chest, the  tension that hung in the silence of the car started to strangle her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Being a  HiME hadn’t directly impacted Midori afterwards; rather, it had  only made her more determined to enjoy her time with<br />
      <em>not  thinking about that</em><br />
  to  enjoy her time more thoroughly.  It had tipped her balance, but it  hadn’t unbalanced her; adding the straw <em>before </em>the straw  that broke the camel’s back, so to speak.  Her insecurity—guarded,  hidden away under every last one of those pieces of straw—had  stayed gone.  But what was in her head now was like a record player  that needed a whupping; that single line, repeating over and over in  her head, not even a thought so much as a background: <em>You can’t  do it. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Midori?”  Reito’s voice interrupted her lack of thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t look up from her knees, and suddenly, his voice was…not  panicked, but urgent.  “Midori, what’s the matter?”  He shifted  into the bench she was sitting on from his position in the front  seat, and he started to reach out for her with his hand—not a  perverted one, but a genuinely empathetic hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Don’t  touch me!</em>” she shrieked, and he drew back in shock.  “Don’t  you fucking touch me, Reito Kanzaki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  not?” his voice was very serious, and Midori wondered privately how  he could be so easily distracted from the fact that it was entirely  possible that they were both about to die.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because…”  he was moving closer again.  She backed up, but a few inches after  she started, she bumped into the window.  “Because I don’t want  …death…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  looked at her strangely.  “I won’t hurt you, Midori.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Says  who?” she whispered bitterly, staring straight past him and into</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>the  face at the window with a gun pressed in her right hand staring  straight at the two of us she’s </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">the  lovely face of Natsuki Kuga.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  shouted in alarm, staring past <em>her</em> as Akira Onuzaki’s face  appeared in front of him, moving towards the passenger side door. The  girl gave him a look of something like disdain, but not quite.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Would  you like some water?” one of the men who had taken her asked in as  kind a grunt as he could manage.  He held out a dirty bowl of water,  not in disdain, but in a kind of <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">it’s all we have </span></em>way that  suggested that maybe she was getting a treat instead of a bucket of  shit.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shook her head, saying nothing, and looked at the man:  Tall, with  big forearms and a big gut that suggested, to her anyway, one too  many nights at a local booze-and-boobs joint.  Too many lonely nights  there. <em>The pastime of the impoverished, </em>she thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But the  look in his eyes wasn’t cruel.  Only a little desolate, a little  resolved.  He stared at her, and for one terrible moment, an  automatic instinct in her body screamed at her, <em>run, he’s going  to take his pent-up energy out on you! </em>It was the same instinct  that told people, <em>don’t talk to strangers: </em>They might do bad  things to you.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  is it?” she asked, afraid but only superficially.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  your restraints too tight?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shook her head.  “No.”  And then cursed herself a moment later;  if they weren’t, they would be now that he knew that she might be  able to get out of them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Indeed,  a moment later, he walked around behind her chair and started  fiddling with her restraints. But instead of tightening them, a  second later, she felt them fall off of her wrists, and hit the  floor.  A moment later, the feet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  stared at the man in awe.  “What are…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  looked straight at her.  “You can see that we’re poor.  Desperate. We have very little; the recession took most of what we  have.  We can barely afford to heat the water for rice. We <em>steal </em>the rice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Is he  letting me go?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  haven’t decided yet whether or not I’m going to let you go.  A  lot of it depends on when your visitor is coming; but I do know this:   Just because we are poor, does not mean we are animals, and we would  never, <em>ever </em>treat a lady such as yourself like an animal.  If  you are indeed going to die, we’re not going to keep you tied down  like a dog waiting to be put down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  let me go,” she said quietly, feeling something tugging at her  heart.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  looked away.  “I don’t know if we can.  I don’t know if we have  time before your guest comes to see you; if you’re gone when he  gets here…we…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>They’ll  all die. </em>She filled in the rest of his sentence with disturbing  ease.<em> Honor has its end somewhere in all people, and I can’t  blame them.  If it meant seeing Natsuki again, I would do the same  thing.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Again,  the niggle in her head: <em>Obsession is a dangerous thing, Shizuru. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Again,  she ignored it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll  know by tonight.”  He turned to leave. “Please don’t try to  escape.  You’re in a basement, and the only exit is locked and  guarded. The window is barely enough to get reception for a  television, so don’t expect to crawl out of it.” At this, he gave  her a funny look. “There are enough of us to keep you captive, and  people are always watching.” Another look.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  opened the door, revealing another big, depressed-looking man who  was, indeed, standing guard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just  before it closed, he whispered, “I’m sorry. Please stay away from the window.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It took  Shizuru three solid minutes to understand that she had been wrong  about her captors twice in the past day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Honor  has no end for these men, because honor is all they have left. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  hadn’t taken away her cellular phone, which was still in her  pocket, and they had just told her that she could get reception.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And they  had just told her that <em>they too </em>were being watched.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That had  been the true meaning of the sadness in his eyes.  It was the sadness  of a samurai as he laid out his place settings for his ritual  suicide.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Best  not to waste their deaths, then, if that’s what they will have.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  pulled out her cell phone and dialed Natsuki.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
They  were pulling slightly over the speed limit, but they also hadn’t  seen a policeman since they’d been there.  The four of them—Akira,  Midori, Reito, and Natsuki, hadn’t said a word since they had entered the car.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki’s  phone rang a little more than halfway back, and about three seconds  after Natsuki answered, her eyes widened—what was that look so  prevalent in her eyes at that moment? Reito, sitting up front with  her, couldn’t tell—and she nodded twice and hung up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  was it?” Reito asked as casually as he could considering that a  casual look at the dashboard told him that they were starting to  accelerate.  A lot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  gasped, and Akira’s eyes flashed, and the two of them leaned  forward.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  being held in a house, she doesn’t know where, but it’s fairly  dingy, in a poor part of town.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There  aren’t that many parts of town to begin with,” Midori commented,  having been startled out of her bout of insecurity into something  resembling the leadership she usually put forth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right,”  Natsuki agreed.  “She asked me to come get her, but then she said…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  said what?” Midori frowned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  said not to hurt her captors if we could help it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akira  frowned.  “For her to be able to use a cell phone at all tells us  that maybe her captors are…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Double-agents?  For who?” Natsuki was suddenly angry. “None of this makes any <em>sense</em>.” She pounded the steering wheel, which once again  attracted Reito’s attention towards the dashboard.  He noted that  they were now pushing eighty, and asked, calmly, that Natsuki slow  down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Fuck </em>that,” she snapped back.  “That was the last thing she told  me, was to hurry.  That she might not have much time left.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  said nothing more, only prayed that there were no cops between them  and the poor part of town, wherever that was.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Minoru  was on the top of the tallest building in town, looking down on a  dingy, shitty little abode.  To be fair, the tallest building in town  was only five stories tall—it was an apartment building for the  marginally-impoverished.  The ones who didn’t have to squat in a  shack like the one he was aiming at.  He had the sniper rifle he’d  been given out—a 50-caliber sniper rifle! He couldn’t afford <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">that </span></em>with all the money he had in the bank!  (Though, to be fair, that  was partially because of how hard it would have been to get his hands  on it.) In his new black bag: Several clips full of 50 caliber  ammunition, and ten large banana-style clips for the odd weapon that  they had included.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He had  asked Scratch-ass, and had been informed that the working title for  this weapon was the “Battle Cannon.” Apparently, it was like a  small tank gun; it latched securely onto the torso, and fired  individual shells—roughly 50mm, with explosive tips that could be  swapped out for fragmenting tips.  It had virtually no kick—the  stabilizer was mostly to compensate for the weight.  Apparently, it  was the cutting edge.  To him it looked more like a jump back to the  days of Howitzers, but in the style of <em>Honey, I shrunk the kids. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  activated the infra-red scope and watched as ten small red blobs  appeared in his field of view.  Of them, he estimated that four were  on the top floor where he could be assured a kill on the first shot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Completely  set up now, he could only wait for his distraction.  As he did, he  searched for the person who was apparently still watching him, but  there were a dozen buildings with five dozen windows between them;  there was no way to do it without his scope, and he had a nagging  instinct that told him that if he did that, maybe the person would  just shoot him and be done with it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He <em>did </em>spot one interesting thing with just his eyes, though.  There was  another man on the roof of the clothing store across from him, which  was situated on Goza’s main drag; the man himself was sitting on a  ledge, with<em> another </em>big sniper rifle in his hands. He wasn’t  aiming at Minoru, but rather, the basement of the house.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru’s  eyes widened and he grabbed his radio, thumbed the button.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  another sniper.  Tell me that’s ours, please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is he  sitting on the ledge of the<em> Clever Needle </em>fabric store?”  Scratch-ass replied almost instantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  sighed in relief.  “He’s one of yours?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.  But we’ll take care of it, don’t you worry.  Just get ready to  start shooting when we tell you to. Also, move ten yards to your  left; you’re in view of the main drag right now.” Unsaid was <em>and  I can see you.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  frowned. <em>Creepy bastard.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  he picked up and moved anyway.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Chie  grinned as Aoi emerged from the changing room wearing something that  most definitely did <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">not </span></em>suit her.  It was a small pink bikini,  with the bare minimum of coverage where it was supposed to count.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not that  Aoi didn’t look good in it, Chie amended.  It was only that for a  girl as shy and modest as Aoi, it was certainly</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>an  improvement</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">a  change.  “Are you planning on wearing that outside, Aoi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi  grinned a little and did something Chie had never heard of her doing  before: She winked. Letcherously. <em>At Chie. </em>The girl stood  there dumbstruck for a solid half-minute as Aoi laughed, and said,  “No, not really. I just wanted to see what you’d think of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think that you’re a dirty son of a <em>bitch </em>is what I think,”  Chie laughed along with Aoi.  “And I think your mind’s pretty  well lodged in the gutter right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi  shrugged. “Maybe it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aoi?  Acting scandalous?” She looked quickly over her shoulder as though  something had caught her eye. “What…is that <em>satan? </em>Eating <em>ice cream?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh—”  Chie never did find out what was oh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A man  emerged from the changing booth next to them and gave Aoi a look that  was a little bit <em>too </em>appraising before he left.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey  pal,” Chie snapped at him, “The goods aren’t for sale, so stop  fucking window-shopping and wait till you get home to play  pocket-pool.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi  looked only partially shocked.  Chie had a tongue to her, it just  rarely came out as it had there.  The man gave them a moderately  satisfied grin, as though they had gotten what was coming to them,  and started to walk out. Chie frowned. <em>This is the girls’  changing room.  What the hell was he…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What  happened next was forever ingrained into Chie’s head in  slow-motion, as traumatic events often are: In horrifying detail.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A girl  walks past the two of them, eying Aoi in particular.  The girl is  tall and pretty, with boobs to rival Mai’s.  She’s carrying an  outfit smaller than Aoi’s, and Chie wonders in some far-off corner  of her head how she plans on fitting into that while staying out of a  jail cell for indecent exposure.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  opens the door, and Chie hears a small <em>beep</em>ing sound.  She  tenses up, and gives Aoi a look.  Aoi, not understanding, doesn’t  return it.  The girl says, “Somebody left their bag in here,” and  Chie looks into the room, where she sees a large, black backpack.  The backpack is beeping steadily.  Like a countdown. Later, she will  feel guilt, thinking that this girl has saved their lives, but knows  in another part of her brain she trusts her own instincts more than  that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’s  studied American history quite intently, so she knows exactly what  this is.  She screams, <em>run! GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE! IT’S A  BOMB! </em>As loud as she can, but only Aoi, forever trusting Chie  with a strength that will later drive Chie to tears, listens to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two  of them tear out of the store, just as the door shuts behind the  creepy man.  As soon as they hit the street, they dive off to their  left, and Chie screams, “<em>Everybody get down!” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nobody  does. The townies, all creatures of routine and habit, simply go  about their business.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  pavement is really hot, Chie thinks as she tackles Aoi and covers her  with her body.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It’s a  lot hotter for the people who didn’t move.  The store windows  explode outwards in a ball of flame that seems to Chie for a moment  to be Hiroshima round two.  In spite of the deafening roar of the  explosion, she swears she can still hear the screams of the people  inside; she can certainly hear the people outside screaming as the  ones in front of the store are incinerated almost on the spot.  Chie  herself feels her back being singed, but it’s only her coat.  She  saved Aoi only from a burn mark, but feels shamefully proud,  nonetheless.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As the  flame vanishes, she stands up and scans the street for the man.  He’s  gone.  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After it  was over, as with many traumatic events, things were slightly more  blurred in her mind.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Minoru  could have sworn he heard people screaming as the storefront  ballooned outwards in a massive ball of fire.  The other sniper  certainly went running as fast as he could as soon as he picked  himself off of the ground.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  inside of him, though, was shaking.  It was that pesky compass, he  estimated.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minoru,”  came Scratch-ass’s voice over the radio.  “This is your  distraction.  Don’t waste it, please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You’re  just doing your job you’re just doing your job you’re just doing  your job. </em>He repeated this over and over in his head, hoping to  believe it in the next few minutes.  Then he exhaled deeply, calmed  his shaking hands, and centered the first man’s head in his  crosshairs.</span></p>
