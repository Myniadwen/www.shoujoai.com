<p>A Single  Scar</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>Friendship.</em>
<p>What exactly did that  constitute? I pondered this as I walked home from Shizuru’s dorm in  the cool night air.</p>
<p>The only friend I  really had growing up was my dog, Duran. I missed that giant mess of  long brown fur so much. He had always been there by my side no matter  what. Whenever I fell down, Duran was there to nudge me back up.  Whenever I was scared, he let me cling to his warm body for comfort.  He was even there when death reached its hand out to me and wrapped  its long, cold fingers around my frail young body. It had been  successful in taking my mother. It had been successful in taking my  best friend. But somehow I had eluded its grasp.</p>
<p>I looked down at the  underside of my left wrist. The deep scar that was left there was the  only thing that remained of that night…that and my memories.</p>
<p>I held my arm out  slightly in front of me as I ran a finger over the protruding pink  tissue.</p>
<p>I don’t know how it  got there exactly. When I finally woke up in that hospital bed a year  after the accident, it was there. There was no story behind it to  tell people, not a clear one anyway. It was a part of me now, and  there was nothing I could do about it.</p>
<p>That scar served as a  reminder. The past couldn’t be changed, I knew that, but there  wasn’t any reason for me to believe that justice couldn’t be  served to the ones who caused me all of this pain.</p>
<p><em>Pain.</em></p>
<p>The pain of loss.  Shizuru and I had that in common. Was that why I considered her more  than just another annoying pest who tried to budge its way into my  life? Was that enough to be considered friendship? Surely not.  Friendship was something much more than that. It was something I had  never experienced with another person, so how was I to know what it  was? Would it be something I would just understand when it occurred?</p>
<p>Every now and then I  would find myself watching the kids at school. They knew what  friendship was. Sometimes I would see them walking in giant groups,  sometimes it would just be two individuals. That was one thing I  learned from my observations: numbers didn’t matter. All friendship  required was two people who would be there for each other. Another  thing I learned was the closeness of friends. I began picking up on  who was hanging out with who very quickly because it would seem like  certain people were always together.</p>
<p>Was I capable of that?  Letting another person get that close…Could I let Shizuru get that  close? Would she want to be that close to me?</p>
<p>At the moment, I really  didn’t have that answer.</p>
<p><em>Weakness.</em></p>
<p>Did  having a friend make me weak? I guess the better question would be,  did <em>wanting</em> to have a friend make me weak? You could only rely on yourself,  right? That’s what I had grown to believe. What I had taught myself  to believe…<em>Forced </em>myself  to believe…</p>
<p>But Shizuru had relied  on me tonight, hadn’t she?</p>
<p>Pushing  those thoughts out of my mind for the moment, I let out a sigh as I  approached my apartment door. Pulling my keys out of my pocket, I  lazily turned the silver object in the lock, which made a welcoming<em>‘thunk.’</em> The door creaked slightly when I opened it and did the same when I  close it behind me. I lumbered through the dark room making my way to  the bathroom. Once there, I turned on the dim light and shed my  clothing.</p>
<p>Looking  at my weak, naked body in the mirror, I couldn’t help but frown.  What did I expect to do with <em>this</em>?  I wouldn’t be able to fulfill any of my goals while I was still  like this. That wasn’t to say that I was in poor health, on the  contrary, I was far from it. I had come a long way since that year  spent sleeping in that cold hospital bed, but that wasn’t enough. I  needed to be better, <em>stronger</em>.  It was the only way I’d be able to protect myself and accomplish  the avenging of my mother.</p>
<p>“If I’m really serious about this, I need to start doing  something now,“ I said to no one but my reflection, a chilling  seriousness in my tone.</p>
<p>I examined my scar once again.</p>
<p>My decision was made.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The next month flew by  rather quickly, and before I knew it, it was already the end of  October.
<p>I  mainly kept myself busy with my new exercise routine. I became  obsessed with it really. Whenever I wasn’t at school, and sometimes  when I should have been at school, I would be running, lifting  weights, doings sit-ups, and just about any other form of physical  activity that you can think of. You could already begin to see the  results of my hard work. Well, I guess people <em>would</em> have if I had actually let them see.</p>
<p>I also continued to  spend time with Shizuru. We would eat lunch occasionally in the  privacy of the Fuuka garden, but other than that, we didn’t  communicate too much at school. Every now and then outside of school  we’d meet up at her place and just hang out. That usually just  meant she would ramble on about unimportant school things, her  getting pleasure out of teasing me, the two of us lounging around  watching television, or doing our homework.</p>
<p>I never invited her  over to my apartment, and I was happy that she was patient enough not  to ask.</p>
<p>Then on one afternoon,  our private little together time took a giant step into the  not-so-private outside world.</p>
<p>I had gone over to her  dorm after dinner to get some assistance on some math problems I was  having trouble understanding when she suddenly changed the subject.</p>
<p>“Halloween is  tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, so?” I  remarked, keeping my eyes on the half-finished worksheet in front of  me, staring down at one of the questions as if glaring at it will  scare it into answering itself.</p>
<p>“So…are you doing  anything?”</p>
<p>I looked up at her with  a blank expression, “No. Halloween is a stupid holiday anyway.”</p>
<p>“Ara, poor Natsuki  must have gotten rocks instead of candy when she was little,”  Shizuru teased while raising a single delicate finger to her chin.</p>
<p>“<em>No</em>.  I just think it’s pointless. All the dressing up and handing out  treats…It’s such a waste of money.”</p>
<p>“Then what about a  movie?”</p>
<p>This certainly caused  my curiosity to rise.</p>
<p>“What<em>about</em> a movie?” I threw back at her.</p>
<p>“Do you want to go  see one? There are supposed to be a lot of really scary ones out this  year. Or at least that’s what I hear.”</p>
<p>Now it was my turn to  strike back, and I mustered up the best mock-Kyoto-ben accent that I  possibly could, “Ara, don’t tell me that Fujino Shizuru couldn’t  find a date for O-Hallows Eve…”</p>
<p>The  girl in question made a fake angry face followed by an equally fake  pout, “Mou…Natsuki is so cruel. And here I was helping <em>you</em> with <em>your</em> homework. Well, I guess I’ll just have to take it from you.”</p>
<p>At that, she quickly  reached across the table and snatched up the paper I had been  diligently working on all evening.</p>
<p>“Hey! Give that back,  I have to turn that in tomorrow,” I protested in all seriousness.</p>
<p>She simply shook her  head, chestnut locks swaying from the movement, “Nope. Not until  you apologize and accept my terms.”</p>
<p>“Terms? Wha—”</p>
<p>“Promise me you’ll  go to the movies with me tomorrow night.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Rather than answer, she  waved the worksheet in my face. I tried to grab it from her, but she  retracted her arm just in time. Growling, I pounced at her from my  spot on the floor, but she somehow managed to evade my attack.</p>
<p>“My, my! Natsuki is  quite the little beast!”</p>
<p>“SHIZURU!” I yelled  as I bounded after her again.</p>
<p>The older girl shrieked  as she ran across the room, but considering how small it was, there  really wasn’t anywhere for her to go. After some jumping on, off,  and around the beds, she managed to slip into the bathroom, slamming  the door behind her…and right in my face. She wasn’t quick enough  to lock it, however, and I quickly grabbed the handle and forced the  thing open a bit. Shizuru pushed back against the door in an attempt  to keep me out, her laughing only causing me to push harder.</p>
<p>“You  could just <em>give</em> me back my paper and save yourself from impending doom, you know,”  I suggested as I continued to win our little game, all that  weightlifting coming in handy.</p>
<p>“Natuski would…hurt  me…over such…a little…insignificant…thing?” she managed to  choke out, a single crimson orb peeking out of the ever growing slit  between the door and its frame.</p>
<p>“Damn…straight!”  I quickly retorted.</p>
<p>Suddenly the force that  had been holding me back disappeared, and I went flying into the  bathroom headfirst. My gut met the sink counter, and all the air in  my lungs dispersed in one quick rush leaving me sucking for air.</p>
<p>“Oh!” I heard  Shizuru exclaim.</p>
<p>I turned my head  slightly to see her now hazy form pushed up against the wall, the  door having bounced back towards the frame. I couldn’t stop the fit  of coughing that followed despite how much it wracked my midsection  with sharp pangs.</p>
<p>She was quick to come  to my side, putting the original cause of the whole mess on the  counter as she placed a hand on my shoulder, “Natsuki, are you—“</p>
<p>I shrugged her hand off  as I stormed out of the bathroom, still slightly bent over and woozy  from the collision. Once outside I lifted my shirt to take a look at  the damage. Sure enough, my stomach was a bright shade of red. I  could see it was already beginning to bruise as well. I hissed at the  sight, but my attention was quickly averted to concerned crimson  eyes.</p>
<p>“Go lie down,” she  ordered me, her tone void of its normal cheeriness.</p>
<p>I glared at her.</p>
<p><em>This is your fault.</em></p>
<p>When I didn’t move,  Shizuru grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the bed, forcing me  down rather roughly.</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>She ignored me as she  walked back to the bathroom. I heard running water for a few brief  moments before she returned with a wet washcloth. Sitting beside me  as I lied on the bed, she lifted my shirt and placed the item on my  pulsing stomach.</p>
<p>“Ah!” I cried out  from both the initial sting of the touch and the cold of the cloth.</p>
<p>I watched as she stared  blankly at my abdomen.</p>
<p><em>She looks so sad…</em></p>
<p>Finally, she slowly  turned her head to look me in the eyes, “I’m sorry, Natsuki. I  didn’t mean for you to get hurt.”</p>
<p>I looked away, “Yeah,  I know…Don’t worry about it. It’s not that bad anyways.”</p>
<p><em>It  was just an accident. We were just goofing off…It’s not like it  was </em><em><strong>entirely</strong></em><em> your fault…Why are you getting all upset about it? It’s not that  big of a deal—! </em></p>
<p>She lightly poked me in  the stomach causing me to flinch with a small grunt.</p>
<p>“Liar.”</p>
<p>There was a deafening  silence between us before I came up with an idea to quickly amend the  situation.</p>
<p>“You owe me then.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“You owe me something  for getting me hurt.”</p>
<p>“And what would that  be…?”</p>
<p>“…Two movie tickets for tomorrow night.”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I was excited. Too  excited really. I mean, it was just a movie, right? But tonight I  would be going to that movie with Kuga Natsuki, the infamous ice  queen herself as she was known around campus. I knew differently  though.
<p>I was glad that we had  gotten to know each other a little better over the past couple of  weeks. After that night at the garden, we had slowly started talking  more. I could tell that she was still uncomfortable with the whole  thing, but at least it was a start.</p>
<p>We  didn’t see each other at school too often, so our little friendship  remained hidden from the eyes and ears of all the other students, but  it was better this way most likely. Poor Natsuki probably would have  been bombarded with questions if people knew that we had been  talking, which ultimately meant there would also be several empty  desks in the Fuuka Academy classrooms. What can I say? I <em>was</em> rather popular around campus. I never really did anything to gain my  popularity, but I was always sure to be kind to my peers no matter  what mood I might have been in. I didn’t have to put up an act for  Natsuki though. We were just ourselves around each other. It was a  nice change from the never-faltering airy smile I presented to the  rest of the world every single day.</p>
<p>At the moment, however,  I was stuck in my biology class impatiently watching the clock on the  wall.</p>
<p>“<em>When  is this day going to be over?” </em>I  thought to myself before a small smile worked its way to my face, <em>“I  wonder if Natsuki is in any way excited about tonight? I’m sure  she’d never admit it even if she was.”</em></p>
<p>Finally the bell rang,  and I quickly packed my bag to head back to my dorm. Right when I was  heading out of the classroom though, a familiar voice called out my  name.</p>
<p><em>Oh, not now…</em></p>
<p>I turned around to see  Kanzaki Reito quickly approaching. Reito was one of those guys who  made just about every female he encountered swoon. There had been a  rumor once that he had a crush on me, but neither of us ever  addressed the other about it, so we remained as mere acquaintances  due to both of us being involved with the student body.</p>
<p>I flashed my familiar  smile, “Hello, Reito-kun. Is something the matter?”</p>
<p>The  tall and darkly handsome young man before me motioned back down the  hall with his thumb, “We have a last minute meeting for all the  class representatives. The student council just called it.”</p>
<p>My expression didn’t  change even though I was quite irritated with his news, “Ara, I’m  in quite a hurry at the moment—”</p>
<p>“It’s mandatory.  They say it’ll only take a minute,” he said as he turned to head  back towards the student council room.</p>
<p>Now  that he was turned around, I allowed myself to roll my eyes as I  followed him. I had wanted to catch Natsuki before she went home, but  it didn’t look like that was going to happen now. She was always so  quick to leave school…Granted I was going to see her in just a few  hours, <em>hopefully</em>,  but I had wanted to make sure she wasn’t going to back out on me at  the last minute.</p>
<p>Luckily the council was  true to their word and we let out in ten minutes. Once I was back at  my dorm, I just wasted time doing my homework that would be due  tomorrow until there was about half an hour before Natsuki was  supposed to arrive.</p>
<p>I pulled myself up and  made my way over to the closet.</p>
<p><em>What to wear…I  don’t want to look too flashy. I wonder what Natsuki’s going to  wear? Probably something casual.</em></p>
<p>I grabbed a pair of  jeans and proceed to try them on. I didn’t wear pants all that  often, especially not blue jeans, but I still made sure to own a few  pairs.</p>
<p>The denim hugged my  thighs, but they weren’t uncomfortably tight. After approving  myself in the mirror, I went back to my closet to decide on a top. In  the end, I chose a white blouse with a black long sleeved sweater  layered over it. After finding a matching belt and boots to put on, I  entered the bathroom to touch up the small amount of makeup I had on.  It was while I was in the middle of doing this that I heard three  distinct knocks at my door.</p>
<p>“Just a second!” I  announced as I finished the last little bit that I had left.</p>
<p>I jogged over to the  door and opened it to reveal Natsuki who is decked in a pair of worn  out jeans, her usual tennis shoes, and a navy blue shirt under a thin  white hooded jacket that was only partially zipped up.</p>
<p><em>Always so cute…</em></p>
<p>“Hey. You ready?”</p>
<p>“Almost…” I  replied, retreating back into the room.</p>
<p>She trailed in after  me, taking a seat on the armrest of the couch as she waited for me to  comb through my hair one last time. Once I had done so, I grabbed my  purse and fetched my keys.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s  go.”</p>
<p>The  raven-haired girl simply nodded as she pushed herself off of the  couch and headed toward the door. We debated on whether or not to  take a bus, but in the end decided that we had enough time to walk  instead. As we made our way down the different busy sidewalks towards  the theatre, we exchanged our usual simple chitchat about whatever  came to mind.</p>
<p>Once we made it to the  theatre, we entered and immediately looked for the listing of movies.  We both stared up at the brightly lit screen, reading it over  thoroughly.</p>
<p>“So, uh, what are  watching?” Natsuki questioned.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s  seven-thirty right now…” I began as I took out my phone to check  the current time before looking back up at the screen to check the  starting times, “It looks like there are two that start at  seven-forty-five.”</p>
<p>We turned to look at  each other, and Natsuki shrugged, “I don’t care. You pick.”</p>
<p>“Why do I have to  pick? You’re the one who wanted the tickets.”</p>
<p>Her  eyes thinned slightly, “What? Don’t you try to turn this on me,  this was <em>your </em>idea,  remember?”</p>
<p>I gave her a slight  poke to the midsection to remind her of what happened the night  before.</p>
<p>“Ah! Okay, okay.  Geez.”</p>
<p>We ended up flipping a  coin.</p>
<p>Once the small piece of  metal had made the decision for us, we moved to get in line. I used  my natural charm on the ticket salesman to illegally get us into the  R-rated movie, and I could see Natsuki’s curious, and slightly  amused, look out of the corner of my eye, an invisible force tugging  her usually straight mouth into a smirk.</p>
<p>Once I had our tickets  and we had started walking towards our specific theatre, I noticed  that she still had the same look on her face.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true  and you know it.”</p>
<p>She didn’t respond.</p>
<p>“You’d better tell  me, Natsuki.”</p>
<p>“Oi, do you want  anything from the concession stand?” she asked.</p>
<p><em>Nice try. </em></p>
<p>”No, and don’t  change the subject.”</p>
<p>She  shook her head, “Fine, I was just offering. And what subject? I  don’t know <em>what </em>you’re  talking about, Shizuru.”</p>
<p>I  could tell by her tone that she knew <em>exactly</em> what I meant, and I playfully glared at her momentarily before  letting the whole thing go.</p>
<p>We entered the dark  room that luckily hadn’t filled up yet, and eventually I spotted  two seats relatively centered with the screen in the very back row.</p>
<p>“Come on,” I stated  as I grabbed Natsuki by the hand and led us up the stairs.</p>
<p>“H-Hey!”</p>
<p>We had to crawl over a  seated couple to get to our spot. I, of course, apologized for the  inconvenience; Natsuki merely refrained from making any eye contact  with either of them.</p>
<p>After we both sat down,  I finally released my grip on her hand. It retreated immediately,  soon finding refuge in the pocket of her jacket along with her other  hand. I managed to keep my chuckling silent when I noticed even in  the dim lighting of the theatre that she was blushing slightly.</p>
<p>“I wonder what the  movie’s going to be about…” I tried to ease the mood.</p>
<p>“Dunno.  But with a name like <em>The Darkness  Within</em> I hope it’ll be decent.”</p>
<p>The movie itself did  turn out to be pretty good, but not necessarily all that scary. I was  not one to pass up a fine opportunity like this, however, so I let my  superb acting skills take over.</p>
<p>During one of the  scarier scenes, I jumped and immediately wrapped my arms around  Natsuki’s left one, drawing us closer together. My reaction, in  turn, caused her to flinch.</p>
<p>“H-Hey,” she  agitatedly whispered, “Shizuru, let go already.”</p>
<p>I silently shook my  head rapidly back and forth.</p>
<p>I heard her let out a  raspy sigh and relax back in her chair, a sign that she had consented  to me staying like this for the moment. I tightened my grip, and I  felt her toned muscles flex slightly at the pressure.</p>
<p><em>Natsuki’s been  working out, hm?</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t like I  hadn’t noticed it earlier. I have very keen eyes, especially when  it comes to my Natsuki. I only wish that I had an equal talent in  figuring out what goes on in that head of hers.</p>
<p><em>Maybe I can ask her  later…</em></p>
<p>Even after the movie  was over and we were back on the sidewalk going back to my place, I  still hadn’t let go of her arm. My grip had loosened though…a  little.</p>
<p>“Geez,  Shizuru, I never thought you’d be sensitive to stuff like that. Was  it really <em>that</em> scary?”</p>
<p>“Mou, don’t laugh  at me, Natsuki. I’m going to have nightmares now. I won’t be able  to sleep without you here with me…”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened as her  cheeks became red at the comment, “A-Absolutely not! No way!”</p>
<p>She tried to break free  of me, but I resisted.</p>
<p>“I need someone there  to protect me,” I continued with a childish smile, “Won’t  Natsuki be my knight in shining armor?”</p>
<p>She defiantly looked  away from me, trying to hide her ever-reddening face, “N-NO.”</p>
<p>“But Natsuki’s  princess needs protection from evil—”</p>
<p>“Sh-Shut  up! You’re not <em>my princess</em>.”</p>
<p>Once we made it back to  my dorm, I finally let her go. Natsuki eyed me suspiciously as I  unlocked the door and invited her inside, but she came in despite  still being wary of me.</p>
<p>I excused myself to the  bathroom, and when I returned, I found my guest clicking away on my  computer. I took note that she was standing rather than sitting in  the chair in front of her, and seizing the moment, I silently crept  up behind her while she was busy surfing the net and gently wrapped  my arms around her waist.</p>
<p>“Ah! Sh-Shizuru?!”</p>
<p>“I’ve been worried  about Natuski’s poor stomach…” I whispered into her ear as I  slipped my hand under her jacket and shirt. My cool fingers slid over  her slightly sculpted abs, causing a trail of goose bumps to rise in  their wake.</p>
<p>“St-Stop it,” she  pleaded while taking hold of my wrist and pulling my hand out from  beneath her clothing. I let her go as I took a step back.</p>
<p>“I’ve noticed that  you’ve been working out lately,” I stated as she turned around to  face me. She was quite red in the face, and her expression was one of  agitated discomfort.</p>
<p>“Yeah, so?”</p>
<p>I paused momentarily  before proceeding, “Any particular reason why?”</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>There was a small bout  of silence before I continued, “I was being serious about your  stomach though. Does it hurt still?”</p>
<p>“A little.”</p>
<p>More silence.</p>
<p>“I had a good time  tonight,” I honestly told her, trying to kill the awkwardness for  her if even just a little bit.</p>
<p>“…Yeah.” Natsuki  slowly replied, raising her left hand to tuck a strand of hair behind  her ear, her sleeves slipping down slightly, “Well, I guess I’ll  see you at school tomorrow or something.”</p>
<p>“Mmh,” I simply  murmured as we walked towards the door, letting a rush of cool air  enter my room as I opened it and the girl before me stepped outside.</p>
<p>“Goodnight,” I  softly said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, later,” she  uttered in return.</p>
<p>I closed the door and  leaned my back against it, eyes closed.</p>
<p><em>So what was that scar, Natsuki…?</em></p>
