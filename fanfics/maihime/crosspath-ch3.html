<a href="../maihime/crosspath-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Erstin Ho closed her locker, noting once again some of
the wary glances that she got from her classmates.
&#39;Just remember,&#39; the blonde young woman reminded
herself firmly, &#39;your fifteen minutes of fame will
pass eventually.&#39;

&quot;Hey, Erstin,&quot; Arika Yumemiya said cheerfully as she
reached her own locker, &quot;can I borrow your chemistry
homework?&quot;

&quot;Again?&quot; Erstin asked with some amusement.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Arika scratched at the back of her head,
her red hair tied back into two braids, &quot;cheerleading
ran a bit long.&quot;

Erstin shook her head with a smile as she said, &quot;Okay,
but you&#39;ve got to try harder you know.&quot; A bit more
seriously she added, &quot;If you flunk out on the exam,
copying my homework won&#39;t help you.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Arika nodded earnestly. Both girls set out
together even as Arika quietly said, &quot;Nina was asking
about you.&quot;

Erstin felt a mix of emotions, anger from Nina&#39;s
rejection combined with a odd flare of hope as she
asked, &quot;Oh?&quot;

Arika shrugged slightly, &quot;I think she was worried
about you...&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Erstin reigned in her emotions. &quot;But she
couldn&#39;t actually come see me about it?&quot; she asked
with a sigh.

&quot;Well...&quot; Arika looked uncomfortable.

Erstin smiled a little sadly, &quot;It&#39;s okay, Arika, I
understand it can&#39;t be easy trying to be both of our
friend right now.&quot;

Both young women hurried to their seats, glad that
they still had a few minutes left before class
started. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Arika smiled as she took
Erstin&#39;s notebook then began to quickly copy out the
answers into her own book.

&quot;Thank upperclassman Kikukawa,&quot; Erstin admitted, &quot;she
helped me a bit after our meeting last night.&quot;

&quot;The president of the executive committee?&quot; Arika
sounded impressed as she copied away, &quot;What&#39;s she
like?&quot;

&quot;Very smart,&quot; Erstin mused, &quot;and patient, too. She has
a way of looking at you through her glasses that feels
very warm and nice.&quot; She looked off into the distance
a moment, thinking off the oddly mature older student
who so willingly helped where needed.

&quot;You sound like you like her,&quot; Arika noted.

&quot;I do,&quot; Erstin agreed, &quot;she&#39;s very nice.&quot;

Arika was about to say something else when the teacher
arrived, and she hurriedly slipped Erstin her book
back. &quot;Good morning Miss Sugiura,&quot; they all called out
on cue.

&quot;Morning class,&quot; the busty redheaded teacher smiled as
she swept into her spot behind the desk, &quot;hopefully my
time subbing for your regular teacher will be over
soon.&quot;

&quot;We want to keep you, Midori!&quot; a voice called out.

&quot;Thanks, Rita,&quot; Midori grinned, &quot;but we all know
that&#39;s because I&#39;m TOTALLY clueless on chemistry.&quot; She
moved up and down the rows of desks checking homework,
her usual top knot of hair bouncing cheerfully.

&quot;Please be okay,&quot; Arika prayed softly.

&quot;Miss Midori,&quot; Erstin smiled, &quot;Miss Kikukawa wanted me
to say hi to you for her.&quot;

&quot;Yukino&#39;s doing well, I see,&quot; Midori grinned, &quot;I&#39;ll
have to stop in and see her.&quot; With that she breezed
by, thankfully not taking too close a look at Arika&#39;s
hastily copied work.

Arika puffed out a sigh. &quot;Thank you, Erstin,&quot; she
whispered as Midori returned to the front of the
class.

Erstin smiled, &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;

Chemistry class barreled along as it usually did under
Midori, their teacher barely grasping the subject more
than her students. &quot;All right class,&quot; Midori
concluded, &quot;study pages 100-112, then solve the
questions at the end of the chapter.&quot;

&quot;More reading,&quot; Arika whimpered as they headed out,
rushing back to their lockers to stow their texts and
get the books for next class.

&quot;And you&#39;re going to have to do it,&quot; Erstin noted as
she twirled the dial on the lock, &quot;I&#39;m going to be
busy with meetings tonight.&quot;

Arika blinked as a sheet of paper fell from Erstin&#39;s
locker, &quot;Oooh, a note!&quot; She grabbed for it, &quot;Let me
see!&quot;

&quot;Arika,&quot; Erstin flipped open the sheet then sighed.
&quot;More garbage,&quot; she frowned as she crumpled it up
angrily.

&quot;What...?&quot; Arika looked confused.

&quot;Another note telling me to take my gay ass off
campus,&quot; Erstin sighed.

&quot;Oh really?&quot; a familiar voice said as she plucked the
note from Erstin&#39;s hand. Both turned quickly to see
Yukino Kikukawa looking at the note, a very annoyed
look on her face. She pushed she glasses up as she
asked Erstin, &quot;This has been happening often?&quot;

&quot;A few times,&quot; Erstin looked away shyly.

Gentling her tone a bit Yukino continued, &quot;I&#39;m sorry,
you should have told me.&quot; She continued, &quot;Can I take
this? I think I can do something about it.&quot;

&quot;I...,&quot; Erstin hesitated.

Arika reached out to squeeze her shoulder, &quot;Let her,
please.&quot;

Erstin smiled shyly, &quot;All right, thank you ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Yukino flashed a smile, &quot;And didn&#39;t
we already have a talk about you just calling me
Yukino?&quot;

Erstin blushed, &quot;I&#39;ll try to remember.&quot;

&quot;You do that,&quot; Yukino said with a bit of tease then
hurried off.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Arika breathed out once Yukino had left, &quot;she&#39;s
really impressive.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Erstin agreed before shaking herself.
&quot;Catch you later,&quot; she said as she retrieved the books
for her next class and hurried off.

Meanwhile, Yukino strode to the student council room
with a expression on her face that could nearly be
described as murderous. Alyssa Searrs, the vice
president of the council looked up with a curious
look, &quot;Good afternoon, Yukino.&quot;

&quot;Alyssa,&quot; Yukino said, hiding her discomfort at
addressing the girl by her first name. Working
together on the council had resulted in a lowering of
the normal level of formality, but it still felt a bit
odd.

&quot;You look rather upset,&quot; Miyu Greer said, the light
blue haired woman always hovering near her precious
Alyssa.

&quot;What&#39;s student policy on discrimination?&quot; Yukino
asked tersely as she took a seat.

That made Alyssa raise her eyebrows. &quot;Discrimination
based on race, sex, religion and sexuality is
forbidden, officially,&quot; she said.

&quot;I&#39;d say this qualifies,&quot; Yukino said as she passed
the unsigned note to Alyssa.

Alyssa read it, her frown looking remarkably old on
such a young face. &quot;Indeed,&quot; she agreed, &quot;who received
the note?&quot;

&quot;Erstin, our secretary,&quot; Yukino said as she took the
note back. &quot;Does that mean I have official permission
to act?&quot;

&quot;Baring Reito vetoing, yes,&quot; Alyssa agreed.

&quot;Good,&quot; Yukino excused herself and got her cellphone
out. Dialing quickly she waited till it was answered,
&quot;Chie?&quot;

&quot;Ah, yes Yukino?&quot; Chie answered her with an
understandable degree of wariness. She was quite
firmly in the doghouse over her outing Erstin, and
only Aoi&#39;s efforts had kept her out of more serious
trouble.

&quot;How would you like to get back in my good graces,&quot;
Yukino asked with a slight smile, &quot;as well as help
someone you&#39;ve wronged?&quot;

&quot;How can I help?&quot; Chie asked eagerly.

&quot;In addition to verbal harassment someone&#39;s dropping
threatening notes in Erstin&#39;s locker,&quot; Yukino said
grimly, &quot;I want to know who.&quot;

Reito Kanzaki entered just in time to hear that, his
expression growing grim. &quot;Alyssa?&quot; he asked, not
wanting to interrupt Yukino&#39;s call.

&quot;Vulgar threatening notes to one of our council
members,&quot; Alyssa answered promptly, &quot;Yukino&#39;s taking
steps.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Yukino finished, closing her phone.

&quot;If you need some muscle to end this,&quot; Reito said
calmly, with a dangerous twinkle in his eye, &quot;I&#39;m sure
I can get Tate and the Kendo club to assist, too.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s find out who&#39;s leaving the notes,&quot; Yukino
surprised him a bit by adding, &quot;but I&#39;ll keep the
offer in mind.&quot;</pre>
