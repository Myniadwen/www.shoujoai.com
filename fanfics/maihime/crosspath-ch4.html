<a href="../maihime/crosspath-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Interlude: Alyssa Searrs

&quot;Miss Alyssa,&quot; Miyu Greer nodded respectfully as she
entered their chambers in the church. The tall, blue
haired woman had a icy beauty, one likely coming from
her unique nature as a cyborg, one of the best created
by Searrs.

Alyssa Searrs turned with a smile, the blonde haired
girl dressed in the uniform of a high school junior.
Since she had revealed her true nature during the
battle with the HIME Alyssa could now use her superior
intelligence to her advantage, advancing to high
school as the new school year began.

&quot;Were you able to acquire the data?&quot; Alyssa asked.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Miyu handed over the file, &quot;while SEARRS
improved their security after we left, it was not
sufficient to stop me.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Alyssa smiled.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Miyu smiled slightly, &quot;my lady.&quot;

Alyssa sat down, flipping through the pages with a
serious expression. Quickly absorbing data she raced
through the documents... only to freeze at one point.
She set the page down on a nearby, her expression
troubled as she asked, &quot;You got this all from the
secure archive?&quot;

&quot;Yes, my lady,&quot; Miyu said, well aware of what was
causing her mistress distress and wishing she could
help, &quot;I also checked into the safely of the data. It
had not been accessed for nearly five years, and
unless the individual was more advanced than I am the
files haven&#39;t been tampered with.&quot;

&quot;Which is extremely unlikely, considering your creator
is dead,&quot; Alyssa noted.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Miyu nodded.

Alyssa nodded gravely, &quot;Then I suppose we have no
choice.&quot;

Later that say, two of the more prominent figures
sighed in contentment. Natsuki Kuga looked up with her
slightly sweaty black hair falling into her eyes as
she said, &quot;I&#39;m impressed.&quot;

&quot;Why, thank you Natsuki,&quot; Shizuru purred as the brown
haired young woman reached out to stroke her
companion&#39;s skin, &quot;I got the new bed just for you.&quot;
She smirked, &quot;Or was it something else you were
commenting on?&quot;

&quot;Shizuru!&quot; Natsuki protested with a blush.

Shizuru chuckled gently, &quot;I&#39;ve missed seeing you
blush.&quot; She smiled as she poked a red cheek, &quot;It&#39;s SO
cute.&quot;

&quot;Argh,&quot; Natsuki sighed, covering her head with the
covers to conceal the blush, not incidentally
revealing she was just wearing lingerie.

&quot;Oooh, you even blush there,&quot; Shizuru stroked her
side, bringing forth a surprised squeak from Natsuki.

&quot;Why you...&quot; Natsuki erupted from beneath the covers,
the two women engaging in a test of wills that soon
devolved into a tickle fight. Gasping for breath and
tears streaming from her eyes Natsuki finally gasped,
&quot;I give! I give.&quot;

Shizuru relented reluctantly, having rather enjoyed
seeing her lover writhe on their bed. &quot;What are you
going to give me to stop?&quot; she asked coyly.

&quot;Uh...&quot; Natsuki started, only to be saved by the door
bell.

&quot;Well darn,&quot; Shizuru murmured, though there was a
flash of something very like anger in her red eyes.

&quot;We&#39;d better see who it is,&quot; Natsuki got up, feeling
Shizuru watch her as she grabbed at her robe.

&quot;Aww, don&#39;t put that on yet,&quot; Shizuru cooed, &quot;let me
enjoy the view.&quot;

&quot;Not now,&quot; Natsuki belted her dark blue robe around
her.

Shizuru looked amused as she followed her to the door
of the suite they shared near Fuka academy and
university, &quot;Does that mean I get to take a good long
look later?&quot;

&quot;Would you cut it out?&quot; Natsuki tried to fight down
another blush as whomever it was rapped on the door
once again.

&quot;Sure, honey,&quot; Shizuru purred in her ear.

Fighting back a shiver at Shizuru&#39;s tone Natsuki
belted her robe a bit tighter then answered the door,
&quot;Yes...?&quot;

Both Alyssa and Miyu blinked as they took in the messy
pair standing at the door, both flushed and panting a
little. &quot;Natsuki Kuga,&quot; Miyu noted after a moment,
&quot;visual data indicates we have interrupted you in a
moment of...&quot;

&quot;Shhh!&quot; Natsuki blushed, &quot;Not in front of Alyssa!&quot;

&quot;Natsuki,&quot; Alyssa said mildly, &quot;I assure you, I am
quite versed in...&quot;

Shizuru smiled slightly, &quot;I think you&#39;ve embarrassed
Natsuki. Isn&#39;t that the cutest blush?&quot;

Miyu tilted her head to the side thoughtfully, &quot;It is
ascetically pleasing, though it doesn&#39;t match m&#39;lady
Alyssa&#39;s.&quot;

Natsuki grit her teeth as she felt herself blush
harder, &quot;Could you please stop talking about my
blush?&quot;

Alyssa looked amused, &quot;But it&#39;s such a charming
blush.&quot;

&quot;Ergh,&quot; Natsuki rolled her eyes, wishing she could
just summon up her element and open fire on all of
them. Well, maybe not Shizuru, but...

Alyssa shook her head, still smiling slightly. &quot;Sorry,
got a bit distracted there,&quot; she admitted as she tried
to restore her usually serious look. &quot;Could we speak
to you privately?&quot; she asked Natsuki.

Natsuki gave both women a wary look, &quot;What about?&quot;

&quot;Your mother,&quot; Alyssa met her eyes as she replied
promptly, &quot;and the work she was doing for SEARSS.&quot;

Natsuki&#39;s eyes widened a bit, then she turned to look
at Shizuru, &quot;Do you mind...?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll stay in the other room,&quot; Shizuru nodded
smoothly. Before she left she fixed Miyu and Alyssa
with a look and said, &quot;I know how you two hurt her
that time... if this is some kind of trick, you&#39;ll
regret it.&quot;

&quot;No tricks Miss Fujino,&quot; Alyssa answered honestly,
&quot;I&#39;m not that stupid.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Natsuki said as Shizuru left, &quot;talk.&quot;

Miyu found a chair for Alyssa, pulling it over as she
said, &quot;Here, my lady.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Alyssa smiled up at her. Turning to the
also sitting Natsuki she said somewhat more seriously,
&quot;You are aware that your mother had dealings with
SEARRS?&quot;

&quot;John Smith,&quot; Natsuki said the name as if it left a
poor taste in her mouth, &quot;claimed that my mother was
killed trying to bring me to SEARRS.&quot;

&quot;Not quite,&quot; Alyssa shook her head.

Natsuki leaned forward, &quot;Oh?&quot;

Alyssa smiled grimly, &quot;What Dr. Saeko Kuga wanted to
do was put you both under SEARRS protection, as she
had already traded something to them.&quot;

&quot;What was that?&quot; Natsuki demanded.

Miyu produced the files from underneath her clothes
and handed them to Natsuki, &quot;She sold samples of your
DNA.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Natsuki blurted, looking first at Alyssa and
Miyu then down at the documents in her hands.

&quot;SEARRS needed DNA for their attempts to create a
artificial HIME,&quot; Alyssa revealed flatly, &quot;even with
that they had hundreds of failures.&quot;

Miyu added calmly, &quot;There were one hundred, forty...&quot;

&quot;Miyu,&quot; Alyssa shook her head.

Natsuki rubbed at her arm unconsciously, &quot;I remember
getting pricked by needles as a child... I always
assumed it was for just regular shots.&quot;

&quot;Apparently not,&quot; Alyssa said with a bit of sympathy.
She had always been aware of her artificial origins,
but the information that she had some of Natsuki&#39;s DNA
had only been just confirmed for her.

&quot;Wait a MINUTE!&quot; Natsuki sat up as a even more
disturbing thought occurred to her.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Miyu asked, worriedly watching Natsuki.

Slumping back down with a faintly stunned looked
Natsuki said, &quot;That means that I and Alyssa are at
least part sisters.&quot;

&quot;Is that so bad?&quot; Alyssa asked after a moment.

Natsuki stopped, then smiled slightly as she met
Alyssa&#39;s eyes. &quot;No,&quot; she conceded, &quot;but it is going to
take some getting used to.&quot;

&quot;Understandable,&quot; Alyssa smiled.

Thump! With a crash Shizuru pushed on the door she had
been listening against a little too hard and fell into
the room, landing in a sprawled lump on the floor.
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she smiled a little sheepishly.

Natsuki sighed, but she really wasn&#39;t surprised as she
got up to help Shizuru up. &quot;You all right?&quot; she asked
softly.

&quot;Nothing hurt but my pride,&quot; Shizuru winced as Natsuki
helped her up.

&quot;Well, since you were listening into our
conversation,&quot; Natsuki said wryly as she led Shizuru
over to Alyssa, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet my little
sister.&quot;

Shizuru smiled, &quot;Does that mean I can call you
Alyssa-chan?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; both Natsuki and Alyssa found themselves
replying, then looked at each other in surprise.</pre>
