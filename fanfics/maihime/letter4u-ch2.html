Has it really been two weeks? It felt like years, decades, centuries. 
Forgive me for being away so long. My obscessive search for the &quot;truth&quot; 
sometimes clouds my better judgement. 

No. That&#39;s not fair. The truth was that I was afraid. After years of 
fighting lies and betrayals I was afraid. I was afraid two people like 
us could never find so much happiness. Even after the lawsuits from the
Fujino Conglomerate had been settled; even after our marriage and 
dodging the tabloids, and even after hiding the origins of that 
miraculous pregnancy, I feared. 

With all of the evidnce to the contrary I thought the gods were against 
our union. Today I lay aside that fear. My place is with you and our 
children. To be loved by you is the greatest heaven I could ever hope 
for. 

My investigations are at an end. Whatever answers I needed are right 
there in your arms and your smile. I want to spend time reacquainting 
myself with your body. I want to smell the scent of your hair and put 
my ear to your breast and listen to your wonderful heart. I want to 
kiss those lovely lips as they call my name again and again.

We&#39;ll of course have to find a sitter. Please ask Nao if she&#39;s free.
I&#39;ll be back by week&#39;s end.

Your love is my only home,

Natsuki</pre>
