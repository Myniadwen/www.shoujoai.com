&quot;In summary, the council concludes that this generation&#39;s Gakutenou user 
is severely underpowered and incapable of summoning her god into battle. 
While the reason for this is unknown, it may be a sign that HiME powers 
are beginning to degenerate, perhaps due to their age and the bloodline 
have been spread thin in earlier days. Whatever the case, it is an asset 
to our forces, and we should make use of the weakness while it is still 
available.&quot; -- Dammerung Academy meeting led by Column #1, the Spiritual 
Quartz.

Midori had involuntarily fallen into a trance thanks to that damn 
machine. She couldn&#39;t help it. History was just so interesting, 
especially Earth&#39;s! There was a gentle reminder in the back of her mind 
that the information was probably quite biased, given how the archive 
and its databases were maintained by the HiME alone, but she found the 
reports to be quite shockingly brutal when it came to the more negative 
things about their own society. It was because of that that she was 
willing to place a certain degree of trust in what she was taking in. 
She&#39;d sat there for hours, just soaking up everything she could, from 
recent events to the beginnings of the Otome.

A very nice older woman came by every hour with a glass of water, and 
seemed mildly amused by the level of Midori&#39;s interest. She set another 
glass on the desk, reclaiming the used one. &quot;I take it you were an 
excellent student when you were a child, then?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Midori replied in her standard aloof tone, typing out another 
search query, &quot;I was a very bad student. I kept reading history books 
during math lectures. I think I almost failed that course, actually.&quot;

The older lady chuckled and offered her a kind smile, and proceeded to 
get out of her way. &quot;It just shows you&#39;re motivated. Don&#39;t spend too 
much time on that thing, dear. You&#39;ll rot your eyes out.&quot;

Midori smirked slightly once she was out of view before getting right 
back to work. She picked up on the article she left off on. &quot;The 
research conducted on the Obsidian Lord during the Last Carnival allowed 
for the construction of the Type I Materialization System, a very basic 
device capable of emulating the Obsidian Lord&#39;s emissions, thus allowing 
the original Otome to summon robes and weapons as if they were HiME. As 
the method indicates, the Type I was the first in the long line of 
Emulators constructed by Schwarz and independent contractors. It was 
rendered obsolete in 2089, when it was replaced by the Type II.&quot;

Click. &quot;The original Five Columns were brought online in 2014 as a test 
unit in Schwarz&#39;s Otome Project. The number of Columns was not important 
at the time of creation, but it has remained an Otome standard to have 
five soldiers in an elite &#39;Column&#39; unit ever since. The Lovely Onyx, the 
Dazzling Lapis, the Continental Orb Topaz, the Ice Silver Crystal, and 
the Fire String Ruby were the original five GEMs ever created. The 
Columns became locked in conflict with the Last Ikusahime, and both the 
Ruby and Crystal users were killed just before the original Type I 
System was destroyed. The remaining three surrendered their GEMs and 
then went missing.&quot;

Click. Damn it was addicting, wasn&#39;t it? &quot;The Fire String Ruby was the 
fifth GEM ever created, it&#39;s primary weapon meant to replicate the 
Element used by the winner of the Last Carnival, the &#39;Queen of Heaven.&#39; 
At the time, it was the strongest X-Type GEM in existence, but it&#39;s 
inherit structural and programming flaws served to make it somewhat of a 
forbidden GEM. The first users was driven mad by its influence, and 
subsequent users also complained of difficulty focusing in battle. On 
more than on occasion, a Fire String user was responsible for collateral 
damage and mass civilian death. It was removed from service in 2095. 
Placed in storage, it was later taken on board the Schwarz colony 
vessels bound for the Lalande System. During the journey, it was 
upgraded to a Z-Type GEM, and after centuries of being considered 
unstable it was sought after by many seeking its great power. The Fire 
String Ruby has not been since since the departure of the colony ships, 
and may or may not have reached its destination of Laland--&quot;

&quot;Midori-san?&quot; Came a gentle inquiry. The redhead looked up to see Minako 
staring down at her, flanked on either side by the Kiyohime and Julia 
users, whatever their names had been. Once her attention had been 
acquired, Minako wasted no time in getting to her point. &quot;I&#39;m sorry to 
bother you, but we need your assistance for a quick mission. Consider it 
a test of your loyalty.&quot;

Midori felt her mouth open in surprise. A mission? So soon? She couldn&#39;t 
be gallivanting around on missions. The others were likely to still be 
in the area, and might consider her a traitor. She struggled for words, 
the other three staring at her expectantly. Then again, she could not 
refuse them, could she? They&#39;d given her food, water, shelter, and 
access to their archived files. They&#39;d been so kind to her. She was in 
their debt, was she not? &quot;What kind of mission?&quot;

&quot;The main force that&#39;s been struggling with the Otome in the 
southeastern quarter has adequately distracted the enemy. It&#39;s now the 
perfect time to slip in closer to their stronghold. It is not a 
permanent solution, but an EMP bomb will knock out their main electrical 
equipment, including their Emulator. It won&#39;t last long, but we can gain 
a wonderful advantage by using it,&quot; Minako explained.

Electromagnetic pulse? She knew vaguely of the technology, though it 
remained largely a weapon on paper where she was from. It would destroy 
any unhardened electronic target. Midori furrowed her brows. &quot;Won&#39;t that 
result in you losing your technology as well?&quot;

Minako shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s range is a one kilometer radius. We&#39;ll be 
clear of the danger once we temporarily pull back the HiME Heirs and 
leave the male militia to continue occupying the enemy. After we knock 
out their Emulator, we charge in and seize as much of the city as we 
can.&quot;

&quot;EMP... so no one will be killed?&quot; Midori inquired. Perhaps that would 
get her off scott free when it came to the rest of her little visiting 
party.

Minako gently raised both her eyebrows. &quot;Not by the e-bomb, no. Why? Do 
you have qualms about that? How interesting.&quot;

Midori smiled sheepishly. She was lying, but it was good to play 
innocent for now she supposed. &quot;Blood makes me a bit squeamish, 
actually!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll be broken of that fear soon enough,&quot; Minako said in a stern 
voice. She was not condemning Midori to kill in her name, but rather 
just stating a grim fact of life on Earth. &quot;We&#39;ll use our Children to 
flying into the target area and then drop the weapon down. We&#39;ll then 
retreat to a safe distance and activate. The target is the old Imperial 
Palace, which the Otome have been using as a base of operations for some 
time. Understood?&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Midori replied. She hadn&#39;t any intention of addressing the 
First with such respect, but her personality seemed to demand it. She 
stood from the computer terminal and then was struck by a thought. She 
still technically had her battle mask with her from earlier days, and 
perhaps if she donned the clothing of a HiME, none of her actual allies 
would be able to tell the difference. &quot;Do you happen to have a spare 
uniform for me? Mine is rather old and useless.&quot;

&quot;The Twelfth, who is supposed to be the Gakutenou user, has a spare 
uniform in the room where you summoned your Child. Change quickly, if 
you must,&quot; Minako allowed.

Midori ran off quickly, back into the Altar of the Ikusahime, and headed 
to the twelfth altar in the room, right on the left side of the door. 
She pulled out a black uniform from a compartment within, and paused. 
Should she take the maroon kimono that accompanied it? No, it would just 
get in the way. Still in possession of her old battle mask, she placed 
it over her face. After all, she couldn&#39;t afford to have her beauty 
ruined by some silly aliens, could she? Ready and in mild disguise, she 
ran back out to meet with the others again. Minako wasted no time in 
starting down one of the halls, checking with a weapons officer to make 
sure everything was ready.

&quot;Azumi is in charge until we return. She and Yafusa will be on guard 
duty. Call on her if you have any problems,&quot; she instructed to the crew 
in what looked like some kind of command center. They nodded, used to 
frequent switches in who was acting commander during Minako&#39;s absence.

Once done, the four of them headed back into the Altar of the Ikusahime 
and summoned their Children, the great ceiling opening once again to 
allow them to fly out one at a time. Gakutenou shifted impatiently as 
Kagutsuchi flapped his mighty wings and took flight. A small and slender 
hydra, Kiyohime, followed suit. Julia Araneae climbed up the walls and 
out the ceiling like a true spider, the Seventh hanging on tightly. 
Finally, Gakutenou could switch mode and take to the air, following 
behind the lot with an ease Midori was not truly familiar with. He 
seemed content enough, even amongst Children foreign to him. He was 
never like that with any other such beasts. It had taken him ages to 
warm up to the other machines of war that Aswad had used.

Their formation was close. Close enough to still hear one another. 
Reina, the Seventh, called out. Her voice was strained and loud, 
necessary to carry over the wind. &quot;Hey, Minako!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; The First turned back just slightly.

&quot;You think that last report about Otome having been brought back from 
Lalande is true? You think they captured Anya?&quot; She asked, and Midori 
kept silent. They had sent someone close to them with...? There were 
HiME taken from the second shuttle that Haruka had found, but they had 
been so silent that no one would have known a high ranking member had 
been taken prisoner.

Minako turned her gaze back to the horizon. &quot;Any Otome, of any world, is 
our enemy if they chose to fight against us. It is as simple as that. If 
Anya was taken prisoner, which I&#39;m beginning to assume, then we&#39;ll have 
to send another team in to rescue her. Let&#39;s worry about this after the 
mission.&quot;

The other two HiME nodded, and Midori maintained her silence. Well, if 
they had a member of the Twelve in Windbloom Castle&#39;s dungeon, that 
would certainly make things... interesting, to say the least. If they 
found out Midori knew, she would have a hell of a time explaining 
herself. Hopefully she could find a way around the danger. She was a 
genius, of course, so she was sure she&#39;d think of something.

- - -

&quot;Shizuru-sama!&quot; Hands were roughly shoving her shoulder and torso back 
and forth. Shizuru gently opened one of her eyes. &quot;Meister Viola, wake 
up! We have to go!&quot;

Yukino was above her, a panicked look on her spectacled face. Shizuru 
twisted her neck up to see what was in front of her. When did she get 
onto the ground? With a light grunt, she looked ahead. They were both in 
a building, the occasion gunshot heard off in the distance. There was 
something else... a kind of pulsing noise. Then, she saw it. It was not 
a simple pulse, but rather the well paced flapping of wings disrupting 
the air. A giant purple and black raven was outside, tearing at the 
building&#39;s outer walls. The structure rocked and groaned, unstable after 
years of combat, and it seemed quite evident that it might have been 
close to collapsing.

The gunshots she had heard earlier were not a result from generic 
firefights somewhere else, but rather from a well organized fire team of 
both men and women just outside. The Otome had gone. It was now a united 
HiME force attempting to exterminate them. Melee forces were 
materializing weapons and heading their way. Yukino had no fighting 
ability. Shizuru was her only support, apparently. Where was Haruka? 
Time not on her side, Shizuru gritted her teeth and summoned her robe, 
activating the flight function.

She stood and grabbed hold of Yukino. Running was out of the question. 
She felt too weak. The flight function provided a suitable alternative. 
It did it all for her. She hovered in the air for just a moment before 
reversing right out of a window, and then she twisted around to put her 
belly parallel with the ground, Yukino still in her arms. Shizuru 
rocketed down the street, dodging gunfire, bullets slamming into 
buildings to her side and right in front of her. She rounded a corner to 
avoid further shots, and then another. She headed back towards the 
palace, or so she thought, taking note of enemy and allied positions. 
The Otome were on the retreat in this section, it seemed. It was just 
littered with HiME rebels.

She attempted to follow the lead of a retreating Iolite Otome, but the 
pain in her body forced her cold sweat and dizziness to return. She 
struggled to merely keep her eyes open and hang on to Yukino, no longer 
truly focused on destination. She yelped quietly, her reclusive 
personality used to covering up her pain and discomfort, and felt her 
body slowly fall from the sky. Yukino gasped in her arms, knowing that 
it was inevitable. Shizuru finally had to drop.

She managed to gracefully drop Yukino, who managed to land with no 
problem, before slamming into the frozen asphalt below. She landed 
stomach first, and slammed both hands to the ground to try and push 
herself up, wincing with every movement. She was worse off than she had 
previously thought, apparently. She felt blood starting to seep into the 
bandages Yukino had applied under her robe. She tensed as she heard a 
commanding voice that was certainly not familiar. Damn!

&quot;Attack!&quot;

She tossed her eyes up, fixing them on an incoming squadron of HiME. She 
scrambled to her feet, summoning her Element. &quot;President Chrysant, 
please stay back.&quot;

&quot;You aren&#39;t in any condition to...&quot; Yukino began to plead, but then 
silenced herself after seeing Shizuru&#39;s intense glare, cutting down any 
arguments. The young president understood all too well, no matter how 
much she hated it. An Otome was to protect a leader with their very 
lives, and if Shizuru did not have the ability to retreat, then the only 
option left was to fight. Yukino checked the street names, a few signs 
still intact even after all this time, and tossed her meister ring into 
the snow. It would force Haruka to lose power, but would prevent the 
HiME from taking it, should they manage to win.

Shizuru held out her dual katana with shaky hands, taking a few steps 
forward as five HiME Heirs surrounded her. She spun and activate one of 
the chains, and it sliced through the air with a light whistle. It 
failed to hit, the targets diving out of the way. The metal bounced 
along the ground and eventually returned upon Shizuru&#39;s request. At 
once, the other three charged and lunged, and she jumped up, assisted by 
her robe&#39;s flight function, and landed behind them. She spun again, 
using the main blade of her weapon.

An Heir met her blade with her own saber, and the two struggled against 
each other briefly before Shizuru leapt back, attempting another hit 
with one of her chains. An heir blocked the attack with her sword while 
the others again dove out harm&#39;s way. Shizuru&#39;s brow was laden with cold 
sweat, her body tingling as it felt ready to give out. Pain shot through 
her chest, a particular ache just under her left breast.

She took another step forward, raised her weapon overhead, and then lost 
herself as one of the HiMEs leapt in and sent a particularly devastating 
kick right into her already injured torso. Shizuru fell back onto the 
ground with a controlled yelp of pain, grunted as she attempted to get 
back up. The same Heir that had kicked her pinned her down with her 
boot, saber in hand. The woman raised the blade and with a muderous look 
in her eyes, prepared herself for the finishing blow.

&quot;Wait!&quot; Yukino.

The command worked, although it was mainly for the HiME to turn her head 
in order to give the president an irritated look. Apparently the leader, 
she barked out a response, not too happy with the interruption. &quot;Be 
silent!&quot;

&quot;We are not your enemy!&quot; Yukino pleaded in the native tongue of Zipang, 
taking a few steps towards the group. &quot;My name is President Yukino 
Chrysant of the Aries Republic. I&#39;m a diplomat sent here from Earl. You 
will be killing a key political figure of that world if you go through 
with what you&#39;re about to do. We don&#39;t truly know the nature of this 
war. We&#39;re only observers. Please release her.&quot;

&quot;I have never heard of Earl,&quot; the HiME countered. &quot;Do not waste my time 
with such pathetic lies, or I&#39;ll simply make your death slower than it 
has to be.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s in the Lalande System. Surely you&#39;ve heard of that. You all sent a 
team of HiME to our world to stop the Otome from summoning us. It&#39;d be a 
very terrible mistake to kill either of us, lest you have our entire 
planet unite and come here to get their revenge, yes? Please do not be 
so hasty when we are not even an enemy. We formally surrender and 
request to be taken to your commanding officer.&quot;

The five HiME quickly looked at each other in confusion. The decision 
rested in the hands of their leader, who still looked quite upset for 
having been denied a simple kill. She sighed, anger and frustration 
evident in the gesture, and stepped off of Shizuru, who&#39;s eyes were 
almost rolling back in her head. The HiME picked the Archmeister up by 
the collar and got right in her face.

&quot;Surrender your GEM immediately. Guys, bind their hands.&quot; She sat 
Shizuru down on her feet, and the leading meister of Garderobe 
deactivated her robe and handed over the GEM, knowing that further 
fighting would only result in death. Yukino&#39;s plan at least gave them 
time to think of a plan. The HiME took the jewel and pocketed it, then 
searched Yukino for any meister rings. Finding none, the other HiMEs 
bound both of them.

They marched, and Shizuru felt her body start to shut down. She leaned 
against the woman holding onto her more and more with every step, and 
Yukino watched in shock as Shizuru once again passed out due to the 
previous injuries and the exertion used in the fight. With minor 
complaints, one of the HiME hoisted Shizuru over her shoulder, but would 
have been completely fine with leaving her for dead. They walked back to 
the HiME base of operations, a few Children flying away from the complex 
in the process. Yukino was led into a small cell, and watched as Shizuru 
was taken away to a different room. She yelled out after them, holding 
onto the bars.

&quot;What are you going to do with the meister?&quot; Yukino demanded. &quot;I told 
you we are not a threat.&quot;

The unit leader turned back to her for just a moment. &quot;Calm down, four 
eyes, we&#39;re sending her to the infirmary to fix her sorry ass up. Sit 
there and be a good girl. I&#39;m going to inform the CO about your arrival. 
Whatever happens from this point on, it&#39;ll be up to her.&quot;

- - -

&quot;What was her name again? Kuga?&quot;

&quot;Kruger.&quot;

&quot;Ku-ru-ga?&quot;

&quot;Kruger.&quot;

Natsuki groaned even before she opened her eyes, her body incredibly 
sore. A sea green eye managed to look briefly around the area, seeing 
the faces of two of the Earth Columns and Mashiro. She was back in the 
Dammerung facility under the old Imperial Palace, apparently. How did 
she end up there? They smiled briefly as they saw her regain 
consciousness. Natsuki slowly turned her head, seeking out someone else 
who was not there. She winced as she tried to sit up, her torso in pain 
from the building that had landed on her. A bandage was wrapped around 
her arm, and it was partially soaked with blood from the impact of 
debris. Right. That wolf had opened fire and taken the structure down.

&quot;S-Shizuru?&quot; She inquired, her head pounding. She put a hand to it, 
using the other to prop herself up. She looked around again, her worry 
increasing. She was the only one on a cot in the room. Shizuru had been 
so very close to her at the time of the attack. She should have been 
there. &quot;Where?&quot;

Ashura gave her a reassuring smile. &quot;Meister Armitage found her and left 
her in the care of your President Chrysant in the city. She was injured, 
but Armitage-san assured us that she would be fine, because the 
&#39;bubuzuke woman was as stubborn as she was annoying.&#39;&quot;

They were still speaking in their native tongue, and Natsuki only had a 
slight grasp on it. She hadn&#39;t taken any classes in Zipang for years. 
Without the others present, it was difficult to understand, and 
especially in her condition. She got enough to briefly understand. &quot;Up.&quot;

&quot;You should lie back and--&quot; Ashura found herself cut off by the 
determined headmistress.

&quot;Up.&quot;

Ashura and the other Column grabbed hold of her arms and lifted her to 
her feet, and Natsuki took a moment to maintain her composure, fighting 
off the urge to sink back down. She straightened her blue coat and 
turned to the Columns. &quot;Where are the others?&quot;

&quot;Ah... Armitage-san is out with Yumemiya to scout the area for any more 
survivors from your group. Tokiha, Zhang and Minagi were all separated 
and pushed to the city outskirts by the HiME. They&#39;re trying to get them 
back.&quot;

Leaving Yukino in charge of Shizuru! How utterly careless, especially if 
Shizuru was injured. What had Haruka been thinking, doing that? It was 
dangerous. Yukino could not defend herself and manage to protect Shizuru 
at the same time. The hiding place better have been good. Natsuki 
tightened her fists and then looked up as she heard a messenger shout, 
&quot;Armitage is here!&quot;

Natsuki stalked forward as Haruka burst through the door, a look of 
panic on her face. She paused as she saw the headmistress, not expecting 
such a cold welcome, much less one from someone who should have still 
been unconscious. She got right to her report, seeing that Natsuki did 
not seem keen on tolerating anything less. &quot;Mai&#39;s group is still 
missing, and...&quot;

&quot;And?&quot;

Haruka, for once, looking slightly timid. She sighed. &quot;Forgive me, 
Headmistress, I didn&#39;t follow protocol. I should have brought Shizuru in 
first, but I was worried that those Slaves were going to finish Mai&#39;s 
group off, and...&quot;

&quot;Where are Shizuru and Yukino, Haruka?&quot; Natsuki demanded.

&quot;Arika and I heard word that... they were both captured by the HiME, and 
that Shizuru was injured a second time during their fight. A few Iolites 
saw but were in no position to give aid, I...&quot; Haruka stopped herself 
short, her determination coming back. &quot;Headmistress, I&#39;ll have no 
problem tearing through their defenses to get them back! I promise, just 
let me go back out there and I&#39;ll make one of those HiME bitches tell me 
exactly where they are!&quot;

Natsuki&#39;s breathing became strained and shaky with rage. Her knuckles 
had become white. Haruka had seen her upset before, but in times of 
genuine anger, Natsuki could be positively frightening, even if you 
weren&#39;t on the receiving end. Haruka froze as that anger broke. &quot;We&#39;ve 
lost a president and a leader of Garderobe! Do you understand that? Get 
your robe on and get back out there. Go find Mai, and I&#39;ll handle your 
little mistake.&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Haruka paused again. She had not been quite that shaken in a long 
time, but it was not simply from Natsuki. Her eyes were moist, and she 
hesitated slightly. &quot;I cannot summon my robe.&quot;

Natsuki stared at her. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t summon my robe, I just... it deactivated during my last patrol 
and Arika had to fly me back herself,&quot; Haruka explained. Both women fell 
silent, understanding the gravity of that statement. Unless an Otome 
lost power because their master prevented it, it meant they were either 
without the ring or... something worse. Natsuki tensed again. If Yukino 
had been greatly injured or had been separated from her ring, then it 
meant that both women were in great danger.

&quot;The ring was probably taken from her when they were captured,&quot; Natsuki 
calmed, and that was the only comfort Haruka was going to receive from 
the headmistress that day. Her face became stern once again. &quot;If you 
don&#39;t have your robe, then you will be ineffective. Do not leave these 
facilities until further notice.&quot;

Haruka&#39;s face became angry, her blonde eyebrows lowering in aggression. 
She was fully capable of fighting without her robe. Given the 
headmistress&#39; look, she decided that rebellion was not going to sit 
well. &quot;Fine.&quot;

Natsuki began to walk through the room and exited out of the door, 
Ashura and the other Column running after her. Both Akira and Mashiro 
followed behind, not exactly sure just what Natsuki intended to do. She 
was still too weak to fight herself. The headmistress ignored the 
protests and roamed her eyes around the facility, trying to find some 
sort of tactical map or battle display. She exited the barracks section, 
walked through the mess hall, and reached the infirmary.

There, she paused for just a second. There were hundreds. Otome, 
standard soldiers, even children, god damn it. She kept moving, ignoring 
Mashiro&#39;s startled cry, and proceeded through the particular area as 
fast as she possibly could, ignoring the mauled victims and the dead 
bodies that were being sorted and taken out of the room. Even children. 
She felt her rage build. &quot;Bastards.&quot;

- - -

&quot;My name is Azumi. I am the mistress of Yafusa,&quot; the dark haired woman 
stated, though she did not look happy to be there. &quot;I am in charge of 
this complex for the time being. State your name and why you wished to 
see me.&quot;

Yukino took a breath and gathered her will enough to respond like a true 
leader should. &quot;I am President Yukino Chrysant, and I want to thank you 
and your soldiers for sparing my life and the life of Meister Viola. I 
simply wanted to see you in person to state that we are not your enemy. 
We simply here to observe the conflict and meet with regional leaders. 
This is a mission of diplomacy. We were merely defending ourselves from 
attack.&quot;

Azumi was seated on a small chair in front of the cell, six guards 
accompanying her. &quot;My soldiers said you were from Lalande. If that&#39;s the 
case, then you will be very useful to us. Understand that you remain 
alive not simply because you are a diplomat, but because you are my link 
to that world. What happened to the shuttle that crashed there 
containing HiME soldiers?&quot;

&quot;They attacked the first person to investigate the crash, who was 
admittedly an Otome, and so they were detained in a prison in one of our 
world&#39;s nations. They are safe, just detained,&quot; Yukino answered 
honestly, calm despite her discomfort. &quot;We&#39;re still in the process of 
learning what this conflict is about. We&#39;re here because of our interest 
in uniting with Earth once again, but have not yet pledged our full 
support to either side.&quot;

&quot;Your soldiers were attacking my people,&quot; Azumi said plainly. &quot;I 
witnessed it first hand. The foreign Otome, although not &#39;officially&#39; 
our enemy, have killed several members of our army. Why should I trust 
anything you have to say, madame president?&quot;

&quot;As I said, we were just defending ourselves. The HiME naturally assumed 
we were normal Otome, which I understand, but it forced our escorts to 
take action to protect us. We weren&#39;t here for more than ten minutes 
before we were attacked by two of those giant monsters &#150; the dragon and 
the wolf.&quot; Yukino took another calming breath. &quot;Surely you can 
understand why we had to fight. I assume you would fight to protect 
those you love.&quot;

&quot;I have to,&quot; Azumi responded vaguely. &quot;I can understand. I do not trust 
you, but I can understand. If you are a diplomat, then is it still 
possible to convince you that an alliance with Dammerung would be 
destructive and not beneficial in the least? I assume you cannot simply 
become their enemy and side with my people. If that&#39;s the case, then I 
recommend going home. This war is not yours. Your people should not 
spill blood for either side.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a very honorable request,&quot; Yukino admitted. &quot;The nations of my 
world would very much like to reunite with Earth, however, so if there&#39;s 
any possible way to resolve the conflict diplomatically, perhaps by 
offering trade deals with both of your groups...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Azumi said gruffly. &quot;It would be nice, but this conflict has gone 
on for years. It will not go away that easily. This is a war in which 
everyone has lost a mother, a father, a sister or a brother. There is 
hatred on either side, the kind that does not go away. You cannot grasp 
it. I am afraid both sides laying down arms is an impossibility at this 
point.&quot;

Yukino nodded, and then dared to ask a different kind of question. &quot;I 
know this may sound a little odd, given the situation, but because of 
all the fighting, the group I was with was separated early on. By any 
chance, have you seen a woman with red hair, armed with twin katanas? 
She is the leader of Aswad, a group from our world.&quot;

Azumi was silent for a moment, and for a moment, she almost looked 
offended. &quot;Midori al-Aswad?&quot;

Yukino blinked. &quot;Y-yes. You&#39;ve seen her?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Azumi then turned to one of the guards. &quot;Move Chrysant-san into 
the barracks and give her a guest room. See that she does not leave. 
President, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have work that must e done. I hope you 
find your new accommodations a bit more comfortable. Your friend is in 
the infirmary and should be healing up quite nicely. I must take my 
leave for now, but I will be back.&quot;

She stood and left without further word. So, Midori had been taken in as 
well? Hopefully she had not done anything to jeopardize the diplomatic 
negotiations. Yukino watched Azumi retreat and exit the room, a slight 
sense of dread filling her. Two guards took her by either arm and led 
her through the building, eventually dropping her into a fairly large 
guest suite reserved for political dignitaries. Well, Yukino thought, at 
least she was getting an upgrade to her cell.

A holographic display of Kyoto hovered in front of him, highlighting the 
known positions of enemies and members of the Twelve. He guided his hand 
over the picture, his finger moving digital replicas of soldiers around, 
creating new way points and objectives for the various Otome in the 
field. He gave them combat instructions over a GEM link periodically, 
their digital copies moving around the hologram in real time. He typed a 
few commands in, relocating and deploying remote artillery with a few 
quick commands. He heard a click, but it wasn&#39;t from his keyboard. He 
looked up, past the hologram, and saw his fellow officers in the 
Dammerung command room frozen in shock. He turned to the side, and saw 
the barrel of a firearm pointed right at his head.

&quot;Verlassen sie dieser terminal sofort, oder sterben sie.&quot;

A raven hair woman with icy green eyes stared down at him, her tone one 
befitting a great commander that did not take no for an answer. Her grip 
tightened on the small pistol just slightly as her expression grew more 
irritated due to his lack of movement. He didn&#39;t know what the hell she 
had just said, for one thing. He could just damn well give up his post 
to some stranger. Why weren&#39;t the others moving to attack her?

&quot;N-Nani?&quot; He stammered.

&quot;Schneller!&quot; Her lips curled into a snarl, and she bore her fangs. With 
that, he leapt out of the chair and backed up to the wall before she 
even dared to think about lowering her weapon, a side arm she had 
brought from Garderobe should her robe fail her.

Ashura and Eiko, the Quartz and Kyanite, rushed into the room moments 
later, perhaps promising salvation. They were followed by a young, well 
dressed girl and an older female who had suited herself up in ninja 
garb. All four of them gave this intruder a shocked look, but did little 
to stop her. Was she one of those Otome from the colonies? She sat down 
and with one hand began to toy with his command display, the gun still 
in her other hand.

&quot;Direktorin Kruger! Halt!&quot; The protest came from the young girl as 
opposed to either of his bosses, but it was better than nothing. The 
raven haired woman did not stop, ignoring the call.

Shizuru gently opened her eyes and sat up, taking a wet cloth off of her 
head. Her body still ached, but it wasn&#39;t quite as bad as it had been. 
She was in her amethyst colored uniform as opposed to her robe, her GEM 
having been taken from her earlier. She felt almost naked without it 
there. She found herself in a prison cell, where she was lying on a cot. 
Her movement attracted the attention of the guards and a member of the 
medical staff, who came to look at her like an animal in the zoo.

&quot;Well, the Otome whore&#39;s awake,&quot; one of the guards taunted. &quot;What a 
shame. I was hoping she&#39;d get an infection and die painfully.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s still time for that, don&#39;t worry.&quot; Another cheery guard.

Shizuru managed a smile despite the rude comments. &quot;Good morning to you, 
too. I hope I haven&#39;t been too much of a bother.&quot;

&quot;Shut your damn mouth, wench. Nobody was talking to you,&quot; one of them 
hissed.

&quot;Not one for pleasant bedside manner, I see,&quot; Shizuru managed to reply 
with a laugh, though it did nothing for her headache. &quot;Where has young 
Ms. Chrysant been taken? She was the woman I was brought in with.&quot;

&quot;Do we look like your secretary?&quot; A guard turned to her friend and the 
pair shared a laugh. The doctor, an aging male, simply shook his head 
and took a seat next to the bars, his job the only thing on his mind. 
Shizuru felt she could be courteous. He seemed pleasant enough, even 
with just his expression.

&quot;How are you feeling, miss?&quot;

Shizuru shrugged and smiled her polite little smile again. &quot;Like I was 
crushed by a building, albeit a smaller building than before. I suppose 
its an improvement. I am still quite tired, but that will wear off on 
its own. Thank you for asking.&quot;

&quot;I will be back to check on your from time to time. If you feel that 
anything is wrong, please inform one of the guards. They will, despite 
their boorish behavior, let me know.&quot; He gave them both a stern glare, 
and they stiffened up, clearly showing that he must have been a bit of a 
disciplinarian to the local soldiers. &quot;I have to go check on the other 
wounded. If you&#39;ll excuse me.&quot;

He stood and exited the door, leaving Shizuru with just the guards. They 
both glared down at her, but she continued to look pleasant, perhaps 
just to spite them. She attempted light conversation to pass the time, 
and perhaps start a light interrogation once she worked her way into it. 
&quot;Ara, it&#39;s a lovely day, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Headmistress Kruger! Stop!&quot; Mashiro yelled at her, watching as Natsuki 
demanded that a man leave his computer terminal, pointing a gun right at 
his head. She had sat down and was in the process of what looked like 
planning an attack of all things.

&quot;This is an offensive abuse of power. Any further action and I will be 
forced to materialize and take up arms,&quot; Ashura hissed in her native 
tongue, waving an arm. &quot;Kruger, get back here immediately!&quot;

&quot;I am not going to sit while there are members of my group in danger. A 
world leader and Garderobe&#39;s leading meister have been captured. In 
addition, a Column and another meister have been lost outside the city. 
This is an issue of global security, and it is my job to secure all 
these individuals once again,&quot; Natsuki said in monotone as she continued 
to type commands into the terminal, learning as she went. &quot;I would 
appreciate a little quiet. It is too loud in here. I can&#39;t concentrate.&quot;

&quot;Now!&quot; Mashiro yelled. &quot;I don&#39;t care what&#39;s going through your head, you 
lunatic, just get your sorry butt over here! I&#39;m not going to have you 
ruin any chance at solidifying an alliance by having you seize control 
of the entire friggin&#39; facility to go on some wild goose chase!&quot;

&quot;Let the Dammerung staff handle it, Headmistress,&quot; Akira said in a 
calmer tone, hoping that logic would win the fight. &quot;They know how to 
properly coordinate and issue commands from that device, and know the 
lay of the land far better than we ever will.&quot;

Natsuki continued to type, bringing up views of the city from different 
angles, as well as video feeds of Shizuru and Yukino&#39;s capture, her face 
growing even more grim as she saw Shizuru take a hard kick to the 
stomach. &quot;I can handle it, Akira. It&#39;s Garderobe soldiers who are 
missing, not Dammerung Iolites. They are my responsibility.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re all completely capable of getting back here!&quot; Mashiro argued, 
Arika finally coming to rest right behind her, looking confused at what 
was happening. &quot;We can rescue Shizuru and Yukino with the cooperation of 
Dammerung. Give that man back his terminal, or when we get home, I&#39;ll 
have Windbloom... I&#39;ll...&quot;

&quot;Why is she playing computer games?&quot; Arika asked, causing Mashiro to 
turn &#39;round and smack her upside the head.

&quot;Ice Silver Crystal, you have thirty seconds before I--&quot; Ashura began to 
bark out, but was halted by the room going pitch black, the holographic 
display and all other computer terminals shutting off. A small rumble 
shook the underground fortress, and she held onto the wall for support. 
&quot;What in the hell?&quot;

A few lights flickered back on, but only enough to light the hallways. 
Key computers were activated and booted back up, though Natsuki was 
without her display, and she hissed in frustration. Reports began to 
flood in from the radios at the other terminals. One of the officers 
there stood up and stated, &quot;We&#39;ve been hit by an EMP weapon! The 
Emulator is offline and the Iolites are without power. The surrogate for 
the Columns is ready for use so long as the generator holds.&quot;

&quot;Where did it come from?!&quot; Ashura asked, running over to his terminal to 
look over the display.

&quot;Members of the Twelve broke through our lines with their Children and 
dropped it nearby. It was activate almost immediately. There was no 
warning,&quot; he informed, bringing up various screen of information. &quot;I&#39;ll 
order everyone to switch to conventional arms. ETA for Emulator repair 
is five hours.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s an EMP weapon?&quot; Mashiro asked.

Ashura turned back. &quot;Both sides use them from time to time to get a 
quick advantage. It&#39;s an electromagnetic weapon that destroys 
electronics. We can repair most of it, but it just takes time. We&#39;re 
without our Emulator for a little while, which means my Otome are next 
to useless. Prepare for the HiME to take several blocks, at the very 
least. Everyone, up the academy defenses and switch all artillery to 
manual firing. They might get all the way up here.&quot;

Several shouts of &#39;yes, ma&#39;am!&#39; followed, and everyone jumped at the 
commands. Natsuki watched from her seized chair, her visage cold and 
clearly upset. Her hand was tightened around the now dead controls and 
she finally stood, ignoring the glare from Mashiro and Ashura. With no 
robe, she was as useless as Haruka. She had no choice but to wait it 
out, or find some kind of alternative. She allowed the original officer 
to sit back down in his seat and nodded once at Ashura.

&quot;My apologies.&quot; She didn&#39;t want to say it, and if it were anyone from 
Earl, she would not have. Desperate situations often warranted at least 
some kind of polite behavior. Ashura nodded back, content with that, and 
turned back to do her job.

Natsuki could only wait. Her fist tightened around the sleeve of her 
blue coat. Natsuki... hated to wait. She hated not being in control. She 
hated the unknown. In the back of her mind, she pondered whether or not 
to call for reinforcements from Garderobe. To have lost so many so 
quickly, it was almost mandatory at this point. Because above all, when 
you got right down to it, Natsuki hated to lose.

AN: I have no idea if the German I put up there was right or not. I 
essentially Babelfished it. Which is always a no-no (unless your 
audience doesn&#39;t know any better, I suppose!). If you speak the 
language, feel free to correct! </pre>
