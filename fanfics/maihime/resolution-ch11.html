<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As I write  this, it seems increasingly that I will have no space left to finish  off my scene with Shizuru and Natsuki this time, because while I have  been putting this off for far too long, (and I apologize), I have  been putting Mai and Yuuichi off for even longer; I will make every  effort to write a shorter chapter and have it out by tomorrow  featuring only Shizuru and Natsuki. Be on the 'lert, folks, cause it's going up roughly six to eight hours from now.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally,  for those of you who think that Akane and Kazuya have vanished, they  haven’t.  I’ll  probably be giving them a larger part in later chapters.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Thanks for  bearing with me!</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Heroes</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  was the only one of the three that had gotten out of the van that had  to give the corpses a wide berth, and he wasn’t happy about this.  Akira and Midori, it seemed, were a lot more used to dead bodies than  he was, and for some reason, he seemed to take this as a kind of  subtle blow to his masculinity.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not that  he would ever admit it in public, of course.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As a  result of his stomach requesting, very forcefully, that he stay at  least ten meters away from the nearest corpse at all times, it took  him several seconds of sprinting to catch up with Midori and Akira,  who were making relatively good time in reaching Mai and the others.  Midori didn’t even look at him when he did, and Akira gave him only  the barest of nods.  Reito took it in stride as well as he could, but  he felt a sort of deliberate insolence coming off of Akira at that  point, and he felt the first glimmers of annoyance, even anger,  floating up to the top of his head. <em>What the hell is their  problem? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  they were close enough to be heard speaking at a tone of relatively  normal pitch, Midori called out Mai’s name; the girl turned, and  stopped when she recognized who was speaking.  It took her a moment,  and though her expression seemed a bit…vacant, Reito thought, it  wasn’t anywhere near of the caliber of the utterly blank expression  on her face at the beach.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That  award, </em>Reito frowned, looking at the rest of them, who stopped  and turned when Mai did, <em>goes to Chie. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  looked like shit.  Reito felt that it was important to note this, for  some reason.  Maybe because it was the first time he had ever seen  her looking like this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akira,  Reito, and Midori caught up to them, and there was silence powerful  enough to pop an eardrum for a moment; they were, by now, far away  from the storefront, and the dim, omnipresent hum of a curiously  envigorated townsfolk was long out of earshot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  most of all seemed to be having trouble speaking, so Reito said, “Are  you guys okay?” This, obviously, was not the question that any of  the other two with him wanted to ask, but he understood very well  that those questions should be left until some other time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai was  the first to nod.  “We’re alright; Chie has a burn on her back,  but we’re going to tend to it when we get to the van.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  was too perceptive to believe that, and he made it clear on his face,  but he didn’t argue outright.  “The van isn’t parked where we  left it; Natsuki has it right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Natsuki  can drive?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.  She can drive very fast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t ask why Natsuki had the van.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do we do, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Silence.   Reito thought hard; they couldn’t wait around for too much longer;  something gave him a nagging feeling that they needed to get back to  the cabin as soon as possible.  On the other hand, he understood  based on the look that he’d seen on Natsuki’s face earlier that  it wasn’t possible to call her, either.  That calling her might  result in her death.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  chanced a look at Midori; the girl was staring at the ground, not  saying anything; her face looked…depressed.  In a way that she  hadn’t ever really looked before; she looked almost hopeless.  When  he looked back, the rest of the group quickly looked away from Midori  as well; they’d all been staring at her at the same time he had  been. Waiting for some kind of answer from her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  she didn’t notice.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">More of  that good old-fashioned Genuine Human Concern flooded into Reito’s  head. <em>Midori is usually the one to “voluntarily” demand  leadership; the one who really gives us a direction.  What the hell  is up with her? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Midori,”  Reito said quietly.  “What do you think we should do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  the hell am I supposed to know?” Midori snapped, and Reito jumped;  he hadn’t been expecting that measure of (relatively violent)  lucidity from her. “I’m just as lost as you guys, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  allowed the silence to last for all of five seconds, and then sighed.  “I guess we should just wait here.  More than likely, Natsuki will  be back soon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Unless  she got killed,” Midori murmured, and Mai and Aoi gasped.  The two  of them began to sputter individually, as though they were caught up  in some kind of race to see who could express the most coherent  disbelief the quickest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If Reito  didn’t have such strong control over his facial expression, he  would have been scowling at that point; instead, he simply said,  “Okay. Then we wait here for ten minutes, and then we go after  her,” quickly enough to cut off Aoi and Mai.  He gave them a look  to drill the point home, and they shut up.  It was probable that this  was the rudest thing he’d done all day, though he wasn’t sure at  this point that it would be the rudest thing he would do all day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  get ourselves killed too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A few  eyes were wide and only getting wider; Reito could see his snapping  point, and it wasn’t terribly far from where they were now.  “Excuse us,” he said to the group, and then to Midori, “Come  here for a moment, would you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shrugged like a sullen teenager, and Reito led her off about five  meters from the group, all of whom were staring at them.  Reito was  well aware of this, so he turned his back to them and murmured to  Midori, who was standing with slumped shoulders, “Would you like to  tell me what the problem is, Midori?”  He said it as diplomatically  as he could; which was saying a hell of a lot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  she said immediately.  “I don’t, Reito, and I’d appreciate you  stepping off right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  fine,” he said, “but if you’re not going to talk about your  problem, it would help out a lot if you would stop drawing so much  attention to it.” <em>Like a little fucking third grader throwing a  temper tantrum. </em>Reito was a <em>very </em>diplomatic sort.  “I’m  well aware that I’m not suited to the task of directing a group in  a crisis which involves a potentially large amount of violence, but  I’m also well-aware that <em>you </em>are.  And if you’re not going  to do anything about it, then please at least stop making waves for  the rest of us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aoi  and Chie are hurting. Really, really bad; I think they were right  there when all those people died, and if they’re not messed up over  it now, they will be soon, okay? I don’t know what exactly has come  over to put you in this bad of a mood, but I’d ask,” he said the  next part very, very politely: “Please. Deal with it on your own  time. Right now, other people need your help.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  stared straight at him, and Reito thought privately that he had never  seen quite so much quiet desperation thinly veiled by a sort of  forced hatred before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please,”  he said quietly.  “I’m at a loss, too.” He put his hand on her  shoulder, and she shook it off, muttering, “Don’t touch me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>At  least she’s not shouting this time around. </em>He grinned at her  as best he could.  “Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shook her head and turned away from him, walked back towards the  group.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Very,  very privately, in the utmost, buried recesses in his mind, the  misogynist in Reito’s brain wondered quietly, <em>I wonder if she’s  on her period. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  else in Reito’s head told him, firmly but fairly, in the manner of  a pacifistic interrogator with a thumbscrew in his back pocket and a  smile on his face, that if he ever said something like that out loud,  his death would be as slow and as painful as any that this world had  ever seen.  What really convinced him was when that part of his head  told him, almost offhand, “She’d start with your balls and work  her way from there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  winced a little and started to follow her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  was already talking when he got back, her voice more controlled than  he’d ever heard it before.  This, he knew, was normal; when people  need to control themselves, to hide their secret desire to explode  and destroy half of a city in one massive fireball, they tend to  overdo it and give themselves away in the utter passiveness of their  face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“—here  with Aoi and Chie; I can’t imagine you guys are in the best way  right now yourselves,” she said.  Mai and Yuuichi gave each other  strange looks, and Shiho gave a <em>harrumph, </em>privately wondering  why <em>she </em>had to stay here with <em>her, </em>just because some  storefront had exploded or something.  “I heard that,” Midori  snapped at Shiho.  “If you don’t like it, you’re free to go ask  one of these nice folks if you can borrow <em>their </em>car because  you don’t want to stick around.”  She pointed at the small mob of  townies, a few of whom were now crying as they recognized their loved  ones by their marvelously-intact feet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Maybe  she isn’t covering quite as well as I’d thought.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuichi  and Shiho positively gaped at Midori, as did Mai.  Mai, however, was  doing so with a small, barely-perceivable measure of satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Reito,  you stick around too; Akira and I are going to go looking for Natsuki  over by where he said they were; she says that she’s got at least  one person watching us right now, so we should be pretty well safe as  long as we’re cautious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  sighed irritably, then thought, <em>I thought we weren’t thinking  about that. I thought we weren’t letting that ruin our mood.<br />
  We </em>weren’t, <em>until that fucking bitch went and rubbed it in my  face.<br />
    That  bitch you’re going out to check up on, you mean?<br />
    Yeah.   That one. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somehow,  this seemed to pacify the little argumentative niggle in Midori’s  head.  That little niggle of depression morphed into rage for the  supposed purpose of releasing it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before,  Midori had had only one real response to depression: She went very  nearly catatonic for anywhere from a week to a month; barely eating  or sleeping, staring at the television for as long as it took to  forget about the really, really big shit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After<br />
      <em>that<br />
        not  thinking about that</em><br />
  though,  it hadn’t gone away.  She had spent a full month doing what she did  second-<br />
  <em>third-  but you don’t get that anymore</em><br />
  best,  and it didn’t help.  Eventually, Youko had discovered her.  She had  given her, out of respect, a four-week grace period to do her thing,  but after that, she had said, it was time to start healing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But she  didn’t.  Not even close; this was depression as Midori had never  felt before.  A kind of mind-numbing, all-consuming feeling that  sapped everything she had.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  “recovery” was essentially based around something that Youko had  said almost in passing: <em>Anger and sadness are almost exactly the  same.  The only difference is how you deal with them.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  what about you?” Mai asked.  “Are you going to be okay in…that  kind of situation?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  had taken to working out as hard as she could; running, swimming,  anything she could find.  She was fairly lousy at fighting; she had  taken to kickboxing in whatever free time her workout schedule  afforded her, mostly with a bag.  The bag won more often than not,  but it was still what she needed. Mostly, she won on the days where  her depression was worse than usual.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Today,  she supposed, was one of those days. <em>All because of a little side  comment, just like with Youko.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  that’s just how it is. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  nodded seriously.  She didn’t want to argue, but more than that,  she saw something in Midori’s eyes that she’d never seen before.  Something that well and truly scared the piss out of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mikoto  murmured something from her side, and Mai thumped her on the top of  the head lightly, hearing the girl say something that sounded a lot  like <em>hungry</em>.  “Later,” she murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  started off after that, and Akira followed.  Neither said anything.  They jogged like that for a few minutes, down an alley and onto the  street where Natsuki had parked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  spotted the van quickly enough: It was the only conversion van on the  street tilted up at a thirty degree angle, and they left their jog  off there, started walking as casually as they could considering that  Akira was still halfway dressed like a Ninja.  People on lookout  always locked onto hurried movements before they locked onto casual  ones, and both knew this for their own private reasons.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Strangely,  it was Akira who broke the silence.  “I know it’s not my  business,” she said quietly, “but you should probably tell  somebody about what’s bothering you eventually.” Her tone of  voice made it pretty clear that she had absolutely no desire to be  “someone.”  Akira had never made a point of getting involved in  people’s personal problems, having ignored most of her own for the  vast majority of her life.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  why, exactly, is that?” Midori said, annoyed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  eventually you’re going to make somebody angry beyond the point  where they’ll forgive you.  And I have a feeling that in spite of  how you are right now, you’d wind up regretting it.  Dying without  regrets is important,” she said this last part sagely, in a morbid  sort of way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  the hell do you know about dying?” Midori said, bitterly.  She  regretted it almost the instant she said it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akira  moved so fast that it was barely possible to track her; with the kind  of grace she usually reserved only for killing people, Akira rounded  on Midori, stepped in front of her, hopped up a little and slapped  her.  The impact was sharp, painful, and it twisted Midori’s head a  little; Akira was a strong girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  have seen more of my friends die than you would care to imagine,”  Akira murmured. “I get past it, because if I didn’t, then I may  as well be dead myself.”  She paused for a moment, and then her  voice turned at least halfway to venom. “Am I being clear?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  looked straight at Akira, and her eyes began to water; her face  turned ashen, and that little piece that Akira had been missing  snapped into place.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Reito  really did feel bad about leaving Mai and Yuuichi alone with Shiho  and a pair of halfway-catatonics to follow Midori, but it certainly  wasn’t any less underhanded than what he’d been doing up till  they’d run into Natsuki that day, and besides; Mai and Yuuichi  understood completely.  There was something very seriously wrong with  Midori, though Yuuichi had warned him offhand before he left, “She’s  taken. Older man.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  knew this already, of course, though he didn’t take it as an insult  that Yuuichi had felt it necessary to remind him; (a guy that he knew  only as “the professor” with whom he was only vaguely familiar,  but whose reputation in his field far was far-reaching, and who  Midori was, last he’d checked, completely snookered over) and it  presented a whole knew set of thoughts and conclusions to his brain,  none of which seemed any more feasible, nor any less, than the  others.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One of  them stood out in his head, brought on by the woman’s reaction to  Natsuki’s question, <em>if it were the professor were in danger,  wouldn’t you do the same thing? </em>But he dismissed it pretty  readily: If he were a short old man and a spunky, beautiful, very  well…-possessed…young woman like Midori was suddenly all over  him, he wouldn’t give it up for all the gold in a rich man’s  teeth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And yet,  it was this singular impression that was the only one that really  stuck in his head, even after his dismissal. Quite simply, Midori was  acting like a woman scorned, and scorned harshly. It created kind of  a paradox in his mind that his male-ness wouldn’t quite allow him  to get over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And it  was this singular impression that came flooding back into the top of  his head as he rounded the corner out of the alley and saw Midori  bury her face in her hands and cry.  Her beautiful red hair settled a  moment later over her hands, over her back, over her shoulders, and  her whole body shook with a kind of silent misery that tugged at  Reito in a lot of different ways.  Akira was there, looking more  awkward than anything.  The tall girl patted her on the shoulder as  best she could, and in a moment, she spotted Reito, who could only  stand staring, completely shocked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akira  beckoned him over with a look of combined panic and well-disguised  empathy, and Reito started walking as quickly as he could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And all  the while, Midori sobbed, quietly but still obviously, into her hands  as her hair danced, a fiery wave in the middle of a tumultuous ocean,  about her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  reached the two of them and put a hand on her shoulder, a lot more  supportively than Akira had been able to manage.   “Midori.”  She  flinched but didn’t twist away this time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  good to see you’ve got this under control,” Akira said, speaking  quickly.  “I’ll be going now. You know, checking up on Kuga and  all.  Thanks for your help, Kanzaki!”   Before Reito could utter  even the first syllable of a protest, Akira was gone, vanishing with  a speed borne of a Ninja scared witless for the first time by a  potentially awkward situation. Reito shook his head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  stayed silent for a moment after that, allowing Midori to simply cry. <em>By herself.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  soon as that thought occurred to him, he put his arms around her, and  this time, she tried to pull away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But this  time, something was different in his mind; before, he had always been  relatively passive when it came to rejection, not that he’d had to  deal with much of it in his life.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  were a villain once, Reito, </em>he thought. <em>However unwillingly,  you were a villain, and you hurt all of these people, and you should  be so, so thankful that they didn’t just walk away from you for it.  Even if it wasn’t your fault.  Hell, if it had been somebody else,  you’d probably be scared witless of their </em>shadow</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  now you need to make it up to one of them, by being a bastard to her.   A bastard and a hero. </em>He thought privately that those two  things had more in common than most people cared to admit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  tightened his grip as she tried to shrug him off, refusing to let her  go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  touch me,” she whispered, and he shook his head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nuh-uh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  touch me.”  A little shakier this time.  “Goddammit, get off of  me, Reito. Don’t touch me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.”  Then, more softly, “Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  touch me.” She allowed him to pull her closer, though, in spite of  this.  She didn’t trust him, but she did.  Maybe it was the sharp  contrast between this gentle, kind, <em>platonic </em>(however much she  didn’t want to admit it) touch and the icy gaze of the Obsidian  Lord that had inhabited his body; as though Reito himself was the  definition of good and evil; he’d possessed pure evil in his body,  so now what could he have but good?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It made  a lot of sense to her at that moment, and she relaxed in his arms,  and let herself cry as she had before; in hushed, turbulent waves.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After a  moment, she whispered, “When did you guys get my letter? The one  that I sent with the picture of me and…” she paused for a moment,  “and the Balagan ruins?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right  before spring break,” Reito said, a little confused.  “Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  chuckled bitterly.  “That means that I sent that letter almost  three months before it arrived.  I guess you can’t trust the  Israeli post office after all.  He warned me about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  clicked in his head a moment after that, and he turned her around to  face him, his mind made up to…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>To  what?<br />
  Not  now.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Midori,”  he said quietly.  “I don’t know why that old man would leave you,  but you still have a lon—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  actually laughed at this, and he stopped, taken aback.  Her laugh was  long and painful; the kind of laugh Reito might have expected from  somebody who’s just heard a funny joke at their father’s funeral.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  stupid, stupid, stupid bastard,” Midori spat, now meeting his gaze;  her eyes looked slightly unbalanced at that point; somebody who’s  been pushed past their breaking point.  “That man didn’t leave  me.  He would have never done that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  frowned, that little part of his head that made him smart in school  broadcasting alarms all over the damn place. “What…then…”  Something was sinking inside his stomach.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  professor…funny how I still call him that, after all this  time…after all we…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“After  all you what? What happened to him?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  took a steadying breath, giving herself time, perhaps, to prepare for  what she was going to say.  She looked resigned, now, more than  anything.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He …  the Professor died about a week after we took that picture.  He  wasn’t really <em>old</em>, but he wasn’t young either, and he had  a bad heart. All the excitement in Israel, with the Ruins and the  scavengers…just…it just took it out of him, and he had a heart  attack in the middle of some fucking <em>shit-creek </em>desert halfway  between Tel Aviv and god’s asshole.”   Reito had never heard  Midori so bitter, nor had he ever heard her so profane.  He had also  never heard her talk about herself in any way; maybe the three were  related. “By the time I was able to find a place to call for help,  he was dead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Dead… </em>While Reito’s stomach was busy working its way into the corner  of his ankle, Midori sniffed and wiped at her eyes, her throat  working but her face calming.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Midori,  I…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  what?</em> Midori thought bitterly. <em>You want to comfort me? You  feel bad? You’re…</em>she thought about it like somebody else  might think about vomiting, <em>sorry?  No. </em>“Stay away from me,  Reito,” she said quietly, after a moment, having regained control  of herself.  All the bitterness and profanity had retreated back into  her eyes, where, Reito knew, it had been lurking all along.  “Just…stay away.  I don’t want your help. Any of it”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And with  that, she turned and walked towards the van.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Mai  looked straight at Yuuichi, and then away as quickly as she could,  looking for some readable sign on his face that he was having as hard  a time as she was.  Because Mai was indeed having a hard time.  On  the one hand, there was Yuuichi, who was presently in the midst of  coping with an extremely annoying Shiho.  On the other hand, there  was Chie.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi had  long since given up trying to “snap her out of it,” as one might  in a movie by slapping her or some other such nonsense; she was too  much of a pacifist to actually try slapping her with any kind of  force, and the traditional “shake and shout” methods seemed to  have done nothing but make Aoi look funny in front of everybody.  Which didn’t bother her, but still.  Finally, defeated, the girl  lapsed into simply holding Chie’s immobile form in one arm and her  hand in another.  If it hadn’t been so morbid, Mai thought <em>very </em>privately, it would have been kind of cute.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As for  Yuuichi and Shiho, they were fighting again.  Something about what  Shiho’s problem was, why couldn’t she just try being nice for  once, why won’t Yuuichi just accept her for who she was.  Nothing  that Mai hadn’t heard a thousand times up to this point.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And so,  she busied herself with Mikoto.  Sometimes she felt honestly bad  about this, about using Mikoto to simply distract her, but rarely;  and besides, the girl seemed as though she needed a little bit of  attention right now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  are you feeling?” Mai asked Mikoto quietly. “You don’t look so  good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine,”  Mikoto shrugged.  She really <em>didn’t </em>look so good; she looked  distressed, though not precisely upset over the whole thing.  “Didn’t  like seeing that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me  either.”  Mai shuddered a little.  “It was all too—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Familiar.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  wish you hadn’t said that. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was silence between them for a moment, and Mikoto used the  opportunity to take Mai’s hand in her own, an act which Mai  accepted gratefully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mai?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did  Mai ever forgive me for that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuichi  stopped arguing for a second, let out a small, strangled cry.  Shiho  looked up at him, perplexed by his sudden, abrupt drop in hostility.  Mai was immediately, vividly aware that Yuuichi was paying very, very  close attention to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She also  was vividly aware of how quickly her thoughts had turned against  Mikoto when she’d seen the destruction, the carnage that had left  Chie as she was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And even  past that, at the same time, she was aware of how easily Mikoto had  …fixed her.  Every time she had needed it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She  asks for absolutely nothing in return.<br />
  Now  she is asking for something.  That look on her face…it’s guilt.  She feels that she’s hurt me somehow. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  nodded, slowly.  “I do, Mikoto.  I forgive you.” <em>I do.  Please, please, please don’t reject that. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If  Mikoto had caught what Mai had meant by her change of tense, she  didn’t let on.  Instead, she grinned, and Mai grinned too in spite  of herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  didn’t mean to—” Mai started</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mai  didn’t mean to do anything, so she didn’t,” Mikoto cut her off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Big  brother,” Shiho snapped, “stop staring.” She had a point—a  moment after Mai had become aware of his attentions, Yuuichi had  started starting at her with such unblinking attention that it seemed  that he’d frozen into stone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  time, Yuuichi didn’t argue.  He just shook his head and turned so  that he was looking at the ground.<em> Damnit, Yuuichi, </em>he  thought, <em>sometimes, you’re so carpet-bagged. </em>Mai, as always,  pretended not to notice, in spite of the fact that her ears were  locked firmly enough onto Yuuichi to make a decent run at a security  business.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mikoto,  however, made up her mind to do something she didn’t do very often,  nor, truth be told, very well.  She walked past Mai, past Yuuichi, to  Shiho and stared at her pointedly for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”  Shiho said, a little taken aback.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  is Shiho so mean to her Ani-ue?” Mikoto asked, reaching her finger  up to point at Shiho.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiho  was positively flabbergasted.  She had been doing what she had been  doing for many, many years, and nobody had ever come even close to  actually questioning her except Yuuichi.  And he wasn’t really  looking for answers.  Just an end to the torment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“N-none  of your business!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shiho  should be nicer to your Ani-ue,” Mikoto said semi-confidently.  “Otherwise…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To say  that Shiho didn’t want her to continue was an understatement.  At  this point, it seemed to her that whether the sky fell or stayed  where it was, supported by invisible pillars previously thought  indestructible rested solely on what Mikoto had to say next, and  whether or not she said it at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Otherwise,  what will you do when Mai and he—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiho  was fast.  She was, in fact, very fast for such a small girl, but  Mikoto was far, far faster, and she had been used to acting  reflexively all her life.  Shiho’s arm rocketed out to slap some  sense into this obviously delusional girl</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>has  to be delusional Big Brother would never go off with that<br />
  slut<br />
  awful  woman</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">and  before it crossed even half of the distance, Mikoto’s own arm  reached out and grabbed it, held it there. Something yelped behind  her, said something that sounded remarkably like <em>chie, </em>but she  ignored it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shiho  should be happy to have your Ani-ue around at all.  And Shiho should  want your Ani-ue to smile, not be sad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiho  was ready to do a million things at this point. She was ready to  scream, to cry, to fight; to deny everything Mikoto had said out loud  and in her head.  She was ready to duel Mai to the death over her, <em>HER, </em>big brother! HERS! <em>Mine!  He takes care of me and I  take care of him. She does NOTHING.  Just sings him stupid fucking  songs in the middle of the night. </em>If Mai had known that Shiho  knew about this…but she didn’t.  Her face twisted into a horrible  mask of rage and hurt, and she prepared her own defense. Something.  Anything.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What,  though?<br />
  You  don’t know a thing about this girl. About either of them.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  don’t know <em>anything</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  act so cruelly sometimes.  Why?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  are you acting so…why are you...being so cruel?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Are  you just afraid?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let  me go! What the hell are you afraid of?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Why  doesn’t Mai fucking stand up for </em>herself?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She felt  her legs weaken, all of the energy in her simply fade to black.  In  another moment, maybe she would have collapsed. Maybe.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instead,  she heard a small, electronic <em>click-beep </em>from behind Mai, who  whirled around, to find Chie standing there, lucid, with a  shit-eating grin on her face, her camera-phone taking in everything  that was going on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai was  dumbstruck.  Completely.  “Chi…e…?” was about all she could  get out.  Yuuichi doubted he could have gotten much more out of his  own suddenly-busted trap.  Aoi was fairly well latched onto the girl,  who shrugged impishly.  “It was a good opportunity.” <strong>(A/N:  Don’t believe me? See Author’s notes at the end of the passage to  see how a psychology class can come in handy when writing a book  –Veg)</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  were…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shrugged.  “Had trouble focusing after that”<br />
      <em>fire  gouts from the window<br />
        people  die without knowing what killed them utter agony</em><br />
  “…thing.  Happened.  I’m really not quite sure what I missed, but I knew I  didn’t want to miss this.” She gave Mai a wink that said, <em>you  owe me.</em> Mai missed it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chi…e?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  shrugged.  “Honestly.  Some people.”  She turned to Aoi.  “You  okay there, girl?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For a  moment, Aoi could only gape along with Mikoto and the rest.  Then the  moment passed, and construction began on the largest grin in Goza’s  colorful history, right here on the scenic face of Aoi Senou.  She  let it expand for a moment, and then threw herself at Chie, who took  the brunt of the girl with a <em>woof! </em>grinning as she did.  “No,  Aoi!” she screamed in mock-embarassment.  “I’m not that kind of  girl! You have to ask me out to dinner first!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then, to everybody’s complete shock, even hers, Aoi planted a great  big kiss straight on Chie’s mouth. Who, once again, took it with a  noise, though it wasn’t a woof.  It certainly wasn’t terribly  romantic, though, either. It lasted for a solid five seconds, during  which nobody moved at all; the exception to this being, of course,  Chie, who allowed the kiss to become a little bit more than a pop on  the mouth.  A little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally,  Chie broke it and laughed. “I told you, I’m not that kind of  girl, you little hoochie!”  She took the moment to grab Aoi by the  sides—her weak spot—and drop the girl to her knees, effectively  proving that using your Powers for Evil was really quite fun  sometimes. She went to her knees after her, and as she did, she  looked up at Mai.  She had to practically shout over Aoi’s screams  of laughter and torment, but she managed to get the point across.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where  are Akane and Kazuya? Haven’t they finished screwing yet?  I know  I, for one, am ready for some of the world’s greatest <em>KA-RA-OKE!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Normally,  this would have affected Mai.  Clearly, she hadn’t recovered from  her own mild shock yet:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chi…e?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Here is  our little footnote.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">True  catatonia is remarkably hard to come by, and is usually a result of  immense stress on an already unbalanced mind. I gotta say, Chie isn’t  really terribly unbalanced, at all.  I think that seeing a bunch of  people die like that might stun her, put her into some shock, but  that this would be as much a defense mechanism as anything.  Like  throwing your arms over your head to protect yourself; you’re  temporarily more or less immobile on your top half, but you’re  safe. Just so, if somebody seems temporarily catatonic, it may just  be a temporary thing while the brain works to block out what it has  just witnessed; P implies Q and not-Q implies not-P, so QED.</span></p>
