<p>“Are you sure about this, Shizuru? I mean, we could wait a couple of days if we need to…”</p>
<p>“Nonsense. We had planned to leave today, and I won’t be the reason why that didn’t happen.”</p>
<p>Both  women were currently inside of Natsuki’s room; the dark-haired one  sitting on her bed, reclining on her palms, while her tawny-haired  counterpart was currently resituating her luggage, having washed all of  the bag’s contents only to fold and place them neatly back inside once  again. Two weeks had passed since Natsuki had made the proposal of  their visiting her homeland of Vedel. In that time, Shizuru had once  again been sent out on official business on Garderobe’s behalf while  Natsuki had kept to her teaching and studying. The girl had also been  given the task of convincing Oleander-sama to allow Shizuru a short  “vacation,” if it could really be called such, and surprisingly, the  Gakuenchou had conceded. <em>“It will be an excellent opportunity for Gaderobe to establish a relationship with this newly founded Republic,”</em> the Principal had commented, which meant, in other words, that it would  be a chance for Garderobe to inspect the isolated country and see where  things would go from there. Natsuki knew that it would be quite a while  before Vedel began meddling in the affairs of the rest of the world,  and thus decided to leave things as they were for the moment. Besides,  Vedel wouldn’t risk getting caught up in yet <em>another</em> war, and  Garderobe wasn’t about to stir up any unwanted trouble. For now, she  believed, it would only stretch as far as pleasantries.</p>
<p>Having  received the okay from the head of Garderobe herself, everything was  set for the women’s departure, but considering the fact that Shizuru  had only just returned from the Cardair Empire mere hours ago, Natsuki  was obviously concerned for the old woman’s current state.</p>
<p>“But you just got back,” the Vedelian continued, “I know you must be tired.”</p>
<p>“I’ll  be fine, Natsuki,” Shizuru insisted, lovingly caressing the younger  girl’s cheek as she walked by, “And besides, I can sleep on the plane  if I need to.”</p>
<p>“You certainly won’t get any rest that way, that’s for sure.”</p>
<p>“If I use Natsuki as a pillow, I’m sure I’ll fair quite well,” the Column replied with a wink.</p>
<p>To that, the girl rolled her emerald-shaded eyes, “I’m not so sure about that…”</p>
<p>“Oh?  Then why don’t we test it out right now?” At that, Shizuru gracefully  dived onto the bed, her head snuggling into Natsuki’s chest, “It feels  very nice to me.”</p>
<p>“Oi…” Natsuki quietly whined before wrapping  one arm around the russet-eyed woman’s waist and placing the hand of  the other on the head currently resting on her bosom, “Seriously, I  want you to rest for now, alright? We’ll leave tomorrow.”</p>
<p>A soft, playful grumble sounded from the other’s throat, “Is that an order?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s an order.”</p>
<p>“But you aren’t Gakuenchou yet…”</p>
<p>“It’ll be good practice for the future,” Natsuki remarked.</p>
<p>Shizuru chuckled, “If Natsuki insists, then I can’t refuse. But I do have one request—“</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“—Natsuki must continue to be my pillow.&quot;</p>
<p>“I think I can consent to that.”</p>
