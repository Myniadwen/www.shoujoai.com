<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leebot.html">Leebot</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/perchancetodream-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><p>Friday on my Mind</p><hr><p><i>Results of tonight’s Battle of the Blush: Natsuki: one 
blush 
in five attempts, Shizuru: eight blushes in six attempts. I really should stop picturing you 
in biker leathers if I want to stand a chance at winning in the future… Damn it, make that 
nine for you.</i></p><p><i>But anyways, if I can control my blushing, we are definitely 
going out to get you some biking gear tomorrow. Once you’re fully equipped, I won’t have to 
be as ridiculously careful as I was today, and I promise it’ll be even more fun. We can go 
to some places more interesting than just circling around Fuuka Gakuen, too. I’m so glad you 
enjoyed doing that with me, Shizuru. Despite the confidence I tried to show, I was really 
worried about how you’d take that suggestion. In any other circumstance, I could never 
imagine the graceful Fujino Shizuru doing something like that. It’s so sweet that you can 
let down that façade for me and just have fun doing this kind of thing.</i></p><p><i>I’m 
definitely going to try to do the same thing for you. First thing up is definitely going to 
be tea brewing and drinking. To be honest, I’ve never actually tried tea before. I was 
always on such a natural adrenaline rush when I had to get up early that caffeine just 
didn’t seem necessary. As for just enjoying it, well, I’m just now getting to a point in my 
life where I can spend time to enjoy anything. Hopefully I will be able to enjoy it, so that 
will be another thing I can do with you.</i></p><p><i>Now, what should we do tomorrow? Well, 
there’s getting you equipped for our bike rides. I guess we could do that right after 
school. Maybe we could have our dinner date after that. I’ll have to start thinking about 
where we could go. I don’t know that many nice places for dinner, though. I’m mostly just 
one for fast food when eating out. I hope I’ll be able to survive at some place 
fancier.</i></p><hr><p>“Ugh, why do I suddenly feel like a walking cliché,” Natsuki muttered 
under her breath as she led Shizuru into the sporting goods store she frequented for biking 
gear.</p><p>“Ara, what could be bothering Natsuki?” Shizuru asked. Her tone of voice made 
Natsuki suspect she knew exactly what was up, but was just playing at it to tease her. She 
decided to resist the temptation to give in to and held her tongue as she led Shizuru 
through the store. Sadly, this just provoked Shizuru to push further. “Hmm, I guess I’ll 
have to figure it out myself,” she said, bringing a finger to her chin as she appraised 
Natsuki.</p><p>“Cut it out, Shizuru,” Natsuki grumbled. She could feel heat rising to her 
face and fought a battle to suppress it, or even better, think of some way to make Shizuru 
blush first.</p><p>“Nope!” Shizuru said cheerfully. She immediately reverted back to her 
analysis. “Now, let’s see. Natsuki’s all dressed up so cutely in her biker leathers, coming 
to outfit her girlfriend in some of the same. What cliché could that fit, I 
wonder?”</p><p>Fortunately the store wasn’t very crowded, so no one was able to see the 
smoke that Natsuki was sure was coming out of her ears as she fumed silently at Shizuru. She 
was at the point where it might be easier to just blurt out the cliché for Shizuru, but she 
didn’t want to give the girl that satisfaction. An idea struck her, and she decided to take 
a stab at it. “You realize if you keep going where I think you’re going, Shizuru,” she said, 
“you’re going to end up fitting the cliché of being my bitch. That is what they call your 
seat after all.”</p><p>Natsuki snuck a quick peak back at Shizuru and was pleased to see a 
hint of a blush forming on her face, though it was unfortunately accompanied by a mirthful 
smile. She’d take what she could get, though, and she let a victorious smile cross her face 
as she turned the corner to the biking goods section.</p><p>Her victory was short-lived, 
however, as Shizuru was quick to recover and launch a counter-attack. “Ooh, you mean like a 
dog? I get to be Natsuki’s puppy?” she said cheerfully. She ran up in front of Natsuki and 
faced her with her hands held up like paws and her mouth open, panting. “Woof! I’m Duran, 
and I love my master!” As if she wasn’t already being embarrassing enough, she followed this 
up by leaning in towards Natsuki and giving her a couple happy licks across the 
face.</p><p>“Shizuru, stop it!” she said, trying to push the girl off of her. The feeling of 
Shizuru’s slobbers prevented her from figuring out whether she was blushing, but she assumed 
she probably was. Even so, she couldn’t help but giggling at her girlfriend’s behavior, as 
much as she wanted to be mad at her.</p><p>Shizuru gave a light chuckle herself as she 
calmed down and gave Natsuki a break. “So, Natsuki likes me acting as her puppy. I’ll have 
to remember that.” She gave Natsuki a quick wink before turning around, fortunately missing 
out on the blush Natsuki felt rising to her face. “Ah, I see we’re here already,” Shizuru 
said as she scanned this region of the store.</p><p>The section of the store devoted to 
biking goods was a rough square in the back corner, loosely walled off by shelves on two 
sides and the walls of the store on the other two. In the center was an overly-large and 
inefficient bike of some American build, the only model sold by this store. Any biker worth 
her salt knew not to buy a bike from anything but a store devoted to them, but that wasn’t 
the draw of coming here.</p><p>The big draw was the vast array of miscellaneous gear they 
kept stocked here. As this store catered to a different demographic, they focused more on 
biking accessories in this section. This meant that they had quite a selection of helmets 
for Shizuru to choose from, along with a decent selection of leathers. There weren’t too 
many female bikers, but there was enough of an auxiliary market for girls who just wanted to 
look like bikers that there were plenty of outfits designed for girls here.</p><p>“Yeah, 
this is it,” Natsuki said. “Helmets are on the stands over there,” she pointed to the stands 
to the right, “and leathers are on the shelves behind them. You’ll want a shirt and pants, 
of course, and maybe a jacket. Gloves are a good idea, but don’t bother with any of their 
shoes; they’re no better than your average pair of runners.”</p><p>Shizuru gave a pout at 
this last part. “But none of my shoes will match the rest of the outfit,” she said 
dejectedly.</p><p>Natsuki sighed and rolled her eyes. “Fine, it’s your money.” Shizuru gave 
her a questioning and slightly mischievous look, so she repeated, “It’s<i> your</i> money.” 
<i>I know you can afford it. I’m the one living off a scholarship and child support 
here.</i></p><p>Shizuru gave a disappointed sigh and pout, and she went over to inspect the 
helmets. Even though Natsuki was sure it was an act, she still felt a little pang in her 
heart seeing her girlfriend pretending to be hurt. With a mental sigh, she walked over to 
where Shizuru was looking through the helmets and brought a hand up to lightly stroke her 
back. She didn’t really know what message she was trying to get across. It wasn’t as if she 
was sorry for anything. It just felt like the right thing to do. Shizuru seemed to agree, as 
Natsuki could see one of her genuine smiles forming on what she could see of her 
face.</p><p>As Shizuru looked over the helmets, Natsuki started describing some of the 
choices to her. “The safest type of helmet in case of a crash is the full-face type, which 
is the type I wear. It’s also a bit more isolating, so you won’t have to worry about the 
wind getting in your eyes and stuff. Problem is that it may get stuffy inside for long 
rides, but if you get one with good ventilation it shouldn’t be much of a problem. I’d 
really recommend picking out one of those. Just find one you think looks nice and fits 
well.”</p><p>Shizuru nodded along to Natsuki’s advice as she looked over the helmets. Most 
of the helmets on the racks were black, as this seemed to be the color preference of 95 
percent of male bikers. There were other colors available, though, including a few white 
helmets which appealed to safety-conscious riders thanks to their increased visibility and 
an array of helmets of miscellaneous other colors. Glancing over these, Natsuki could pick 
out immediately which one Shizuru would go for in the end, though she seemed to be making a 
token effort at not jumping right to it.</p><p>With a light chuckle, Natsuki went over to 
the end of the rack and picked out a helmet in Shizuru’s favorite shade of purple. As 
Shizuru looked over to see what she was doing, Natsuki brought it up and fitted it over her 
head, briefly surprising her. “There, how does that one feel?”</p><p>Getting a response of 
only muffled sounds from inside the helmet, Natsuki flipped up the visor for Shizuru. As her 
face became visible, another of her genuine smiles spread across it, and Natsuki could see a 
twinkle in her eye. “Perfect. Natsuki has quite an eye for these things.”</p><p>Natsuki gave 
a small smile back, but she quickly turned away when she felt heat starting to rise to her 
cheeks. Shizuru wasn’t going to get her that easily. She covered up her turning red by 
saying, “Okay, now for your leathers. Pretty much anything here is good enough safety-wise, 
so just pick out whatever looks good and fits you.”</p><p>It seemed Shizuru had another 
idea, though. Natsuki felt her hands creep over her shoulders, and Shizuru lightly blew into 
her ear. A shudder ran through Natsuki’s body at this sudden intimate act. “I have a better 
idea,” Shizuru said softly into her ear. “Natsuki seems to be getting quite worked up for 
some reason.” <i>Might the reason be that you’re actively trying to work me up?</i> “So, how 
about you go off and browse around the store yourself for a bit and cool off, while I pick 
out something. You can meet me at the dressing room in 15 minutes or so to see what I’ve 
found.”</p><p>“A-alright,” Natsuki said, trying and failing to ignore the warm breath that 
Shizuru was once again blowing into her ear. With one last wave of shudders, she slipped out 
of Shizuru’s grasp and headed out of the section. She turned back to give the mirthful 
Shizuru one last wave as she ducked out of sight.</p><p>Her mind briefly wondered what 
Shizuru had in mind with getting rid of her. Was she being a bit overbearing here? Did 
Shizuru need her space? Or was this just another way of teasing her? The last seemed the 
most likely, though it still felt like there had to be more to the tease than just this. 
With a sigh, Natsuki resigned herself to whatever big tease Shizuru was setting up as she 
headed off to browse around a bit.</p><p>She didn’t find much else in the store that grabbed 
her interest. Although she was certainly no slouch in most athletic endeavors, none of them 
held any particular draw for her. Eventually she settled on browsing some of the 
hand-weights; they would be a good way for her to keep in shape when she didn’t have access 
to the gym. After testing out what she could lift easily, she settled on a couple of 25 lb. 
weights which seemed to be just heavy enough to give her a bit of a challenge.</p><p>The 
flaw in her plan was revealed to her as she started walking back towards the changing room: 
She’d have to lug these weights around with her until she left. Although she was able to 
lift and carry them, her arms were bound to get quite sore before long. She glanced around 
to see if there were any employees about that could help her, but she wasn’t able to spot 
any. <i>Well, at least this lack of employees wandering about kept any of them from walking 
in on Shizuru and me earlier, but still…</i></p><p>The changing rooms were mostly empty when 
Natsuki got there. In fact, only one seemed to be in use, so she assumed that Shizuru was 
likely inside it. “Hey, Shizuru, you there?” she said.</p><p>“Yes, Natsuki, just a second,” 
came the reply. Natsuki heard the sound of a zipper from behind the door, and it opened a 
moment later.</p><p>“Shi-Shizuru…” Natsuki was stunned by the sight. Shizuru had donned a 
pair of skin-tight black leather pants, accompanied with a dark blue leather vest which was 
disturbingly form-fitting on her. In fact, it seemed to even work to emphasize her form in 
just the right places…</p><p>Shizuru cocked her head, and an expression of concern rose on 
her face. “Ara, is Natsuki alright?”</p><p>“Y-yeah,” Natsuki said, barely able to vocalize 
the words. <i>Just a blush, I’m sure. Nothing worse than what she usually does to me, but 
still… Why did it take me so long to notice how sexy she is?</i></p><p>Shizuru took a couple 
of steps towards Natsuki and bent her head down a bit. “Oh my, Natsuki. I think your nose is 
bleeding. Are you sure you’re alright?”</p><p>It took Natsuki’s mind a few minutes to get 
its focus off of Shizuru’s body and onto her words. When it did, though, the reaction was 
immediate. “Huh? What!?” Her left hand shot up to her nose, but the determination of whether 
or not it was indeed bleeding was interrupted by the determination that yes, she had just 
forgotten about the weight that was in her hand and yes, it had just painfully fallen on her 
foot.</p><p>Natsuki yelped in pain and her hands instinctively went to cradle her throbbing 
foot. This was of course a bad idea, as she’d forgotten about the weight in her other hand 
which chose that moment as a good time to obey gravity and strike her other foot. Another 
whimper of pain escaped from Natsuki’s mouth as she crumpled to the ground to cradle both of 
her feet.</p><p><i>Stupid sexy Shizuru…</i></p><hr><p>“Ara ara, I’m so sorry, Natsuki,” 
Shizuru said as she placed the icepacks on Natsuki’s feet. “I was just trying to tease you, 
so I made up the nosebleed thing. I didn’t think that it might make you drop the 
weights.”</p><p>Natsuki grunted and turned her head away from Shizuru. She wasn’t really mad 
at her girlfriend, just at herself for being idiotic enough to forget about 25 lb. weights 
in her hands. But Shizuru regretting her teasing was a situation that didn’t come around 
often, and she wanted to milk the moment for all it was worth. “Did you really have to carry 
me out of the store like that? Everyone was watching.”</p><p>“It was only a couple of 
customers and the cashier,” Shizuru said. Her voice had taken a pathetic tone, and Natsuki 
imagined that a pout had formed on her face. “Besides, there was no way you’d be able to 
walk out on your own.”</p><p>Natsuki gave another grunt. No way she could really argue with 
that. To Shizuru’s credit, she had done everything she could for Natsuki after the incident. 
She’d immediately carried Natsuki out of the store, stepping back in quickly to pay for her 
leathers, her helmet, and Natsuki’s weights. She’d then driven Natsuki back to her dorm, 
where she was now applying ice packs to her swollen feet. The best part was that she’d done 
it all without a single tease.</p><p>With a sigh, Natsuki turned her head back to look at 
Shizuru. Perhaps she was going a bit far with trying to make her feel guilty. She really 
didn’t deserve that. It wasn’t even as if she really minded her teasing when it came down to 
it; she wouldn’t be Fujino Shizuru without it. Judging by the expression on her face, she 
was really upset about this, and Natsuki just couldn’t let her suffer if she could help 
it.</p><p>Natsuki forced a smile onto her face and said as convincingly as she could, 
“Thanks, Shizuru.” She did mean it, but it didn’t end up coming out very well. She was still 
a bit upset, after all. Whoever’s fault this was, it meant they couldn’t go out on their 
date this evening. Since she hadn’t even brought up the suggestion with Shizuru yet, it 
would be hard to explain that to her.</p><p>Shizuru’s expression softened a little, and she 
gave a weak smile. Pain showed through clearly in her eyes, though, and it looked like she 
was on the verge of tears. She was still obviously quite torn up, feeling responsible for 
hurting Natsuki. Natsuki in turn was torn up from seeing Shizuru in pain, and she struggled 
to think of what she could do to reassure her.</p><p>When an idea struck her, Natsuki held 
out her hand to Shizuru, who cautiously gripped it, unsure of her intentions. Not wanting to 
say anything and end up spoiling the moment, Natsuki simply pulled Shizuru over to her. When 
she was within range, she let go of her hand and brought both of her own hands up behind 
Shizuru’s head. She lightly pulled her girlfriend, who had started to get the hint, down to 
her face and gave her a tender kiss.</p><p>On one level, Natsuki was starting to worry that 
she might be overplaying this one trick. It seemed it was the only thing she could ever 
think of to ease Shizuru’s suffering. Then again, it had always worked. It was a good way 
for her to make her feelings clear without struggling and failing for words.</p><p>And of 
course, it was quite enjoyable. Natsuki didn’t think she’d ever get tired of feeling 
Shizuru’s lips against her own like this. They were so soft, and they always seemed to move 
against hers in just the right way. They had a unique taste all to their own, though it was 
somewhat reminiscent of green tea, which just screamed, “Shizuru,” to her. That was the best 
part, really, that it was Shizuru she was sharing this with.</p><p>As they parted for 
breath, Natsuki took a chance to hazard some words. “Don’t worry, Shizuru. It’s not your 
fault. I’m not mad at you,” she said as she looked into Shizuru’s eyes. She watched as the 
guilt in them faded a little, though it didn’t completely vanish.</p><p>Shizuru gave a small 
nod. “Natsuki is still upset, though,” she said. “What’s wrong?”</p><p><i>Damn it. Am I 
always this transparent?</i> Natsuki let out a sigh as she dropped her gaze from Shizuru’s. 
No point holding back her concerns about their date at this point. “I was hoping… to go out 
for dinner with you tonight,” she said. A blush rose to her cheeks at the thought of how she 
was being too sentimental about this, but she pushed through. “I wanted us to have our first 
date…”</p><p>She couldn’t see Shizuru’s eyes since she’d looked down, but Natsuki was able 
to get a clear view of her cheeks turning red at this. She was never able to make her 
girlfriend blush when she was actively trying to, but it just seemed to happen on its own 
when she was going for something else. <i>Ah well, I’ll take what I can get.</i></p><p>“You 
know,” Shizuru said, pulling Natsuki out of her reverie. “We don’t really need to go out for 
it to be a date.”</p><p>Natsuki furrowed her brow as she looked up at Shizuru. The girl had 
that mischievous glint in her eyes, though it wasn’t as frightening as it normally was. 
“Isn’t that the whole point of a date, though?” Natsuki said. “To go out and have dinner or 
go to a movie or something?”</p><p>“Oh, those are just the locations,” Shizuru said. She 
pushed herself up from the bed as she started to share her idea with Natsuki. “The point of 
a date is to be with someone you care about and just have fun and get to know them. We can 
do that perfectly fine right here. I’ll go order us a pizza – I know how you are for fast 
food – and we’ll have our first date right here in your room. Sound good?”</p><p>At the 
hopeful look on Shizuru’s face, Natsuki’s mind flashed back to when she was acting like a 
puppy earlier. She could just imagine that same expression showing up on a dog’s face, 
hopeful that she’d pleased her master. Thoughts ran through her head about how if this was 
all it took to qualify as a date, they’d already done that the previous week while Shizuru 
was taking care of her on a couple of days, but she pushed them away. She just couldn’t 
bring herself to disappoint Shizuru when she was acting like this.</p><p>“Alright then.” 
Natsuki allowed a smile to form on her face as she thought about how cute Shizuru was being. 
“It’s a date.”</p><p>Shizuru’s face lit up and she let out a squeal of joy. It seemed a bit 
over-the-top, especially for the normally reserved girl, and Natsuki suspected that she was 
deliberately making it that way for her benefit. She wasn’t complaining, though, except 
maybe about the fact that she didn’t have a camera on-hand so she could keep a record of 
this… not that she was <i>planning</i> on using it to blackmail Shizuru, but it never hurt 
to be prepared.</p><p>As Shizuru left to order them a pizza, Natsuki took a moment to 
inspect the state of her feet. She really hoped that nothing was broken or even sprained, as 
she couldn’t afford to miss any school. If that was the case, unfortunately she’d just have 
to suffer through the pain and go to class anyways, plus she’d probably have to fight off 
Shizuru’s offers to carry her to class.</p><p>With a deep breath to prepare herself for the 
worst, Natsuki sat up and nervously peeled the ice pack off of her left foot. It was still 
quite swollen, and a dark bruise had formed. That wasn’t too bad; a bruise she could live 
with. She cautiously tried moving her foot around, wincing at the pain this elicited. It was 
mostly located where the bruising was, though, so she hoped this meant there wasn’t any 
deeper damage. At least it was a good indication nothing was broken. She then replaced the 
icepack and repeated the process on her right foot. The damage didn’t seem to be as bad on 
that one, likely because the weight didn’t have as far to fall. She sighed with relief as 
she laid back down. She’d have to check a bit later to make sure there weren’t any sprains 
or anything, but the signs were good so far.</p><p>“So how are your feet doing, Natsuki?” 
Natsuki jerked in surprise at the sound of Shizuru’s voice. <i>Damn, she can be sneaky when 
she wants to be.</i> Her jolt prompted a giggle from the girl, which Natsuki tried and 
failed to shut up with a glare. Sadly, it seemed that Shizuru had developed an immunity to 
the Kuga Death Glare.</p><p>Growling briefly at her failure to stop Shizuru’s laughter, 
Natsuki rolled her eyes and responded, “They seem to be about as good as I could hope. We’ll 
see how they are later on, but I don’t think there’s anything broken at 
least.”</p><p>Shizuru gave a smile as her laughter quieted down. “That’s good,” she said. 
She approached Natsuki’s bed and took her usual spot on the side of it. “So, you think 
you’ll be able to make it to class on your own tomorrow morning?” she said with a hopeful 
glint in her eye.</p><p><i>Yup, I was right about that one.</i> “Yeah, I think I should be 
able to make it,” Natsuki said, and the hope faded from Shizuru’s eyes as she went into 
pouting mode. Mentally growling at how she was letting herself be manipulated so easily, she 
conceded through clenched teeth, “You can carry me around the room tonight, if you insist.” 
<i>Damn you, Shizuru. I really should be able to resist that fake pout of 
yours.</i></p><p>Shizuru’s face immediately lit up at Natsuki’s concession, and Natsuki was 
worried for a moment that she’d be picked up right there. Fortunately, Shizuru was a bit 
more merciful than this, and she gave Natsuki a reprieve for the moment. She wouldn’t be 
able to evade her grasp indefinitely though, she knew. With a sigh, Natsuki let herself fall 
back down to the bed. Might as well be comfortable while waiting for Shizuru to abduct 
her.</p><p>“So, I take it you’re done ordering the pizza?” she said, as she tried to find 
the perfect spot on the pillow to lay her head. “What type did you get for 
us?”</p><p>Shizuru gave an exaggerated sigh. “Well, I tried and I tried, but I’m sorry to 
say they just refused to put mayonnaise on it for you.”</p><p>“Baka,” Natsuki said. She 
contemplated sticking her tongue out at Shizuru, but decided against it when she recalled 
what happened the last time she’d done that. Okay, it wasn’t that bad… but later. “I don’t 
put mayonnaise on everything, you know.” Shizuru gave her a blank look. “Well, I don’t! It 
just doesn’t work with pizza, for one thing.”</p><p>Shizuru’s eyes rolled. Even if it she 
believed Natsuki, she wasn’t going to give in to it. “Well anyways, I got a half-and-half 
pizza. Veggie for me, meat lover’s for you. You’re going to need the protein to build up 
muscles with those new weights.”</p><p>“Excuses, excuses,” Natsuki taunted. “You know as 
well as I do that you just got it because I like it.” She was ready for Shizuru’s pout this 
time, and had her counterattack planned out in advance. Preparing herself for what she knew 
would be coming, she thrust her tongue out tauntingly at Shizuru. Sure enough, it took less 
than two seconds for her to find herself with her lips locked to Shizuru’s and her tongue 
deep inside the girl’s mouth.</p><p>Allowing herself only a second to chuckle over her 
victory at manipulating the master manipulator, Natsuki let herself be absorbed into the 
sensations of the kiss. Shizuru seemed to be focusing most of her attentions on her tongue, 
as Natsuki felt the silky texture of her girlfriend’s lips encompassing and massaging it 
while her tongue playfully circled around it and occasionally flicked at the 
tip.</p><p>Natsuki unconsciously let out a yelp when she suddenly lost track of Shizuru’s 
tongue. She rapidly brought her hands up to pull Shizuru’s head as close as she could into 
hers, tilting it to the side so their mouths fit together better, while she thrust her own 
tongue forward in search of it, conscious that this was probably exactly Shizuru’s intent. 
As soon as she found it hiding at the back of her mouth, it thrust back out along the length 
of her own tongue, extending well into her mouth.</p><p>She quickly realized that her tongue 
was no longer Shizuru’s primary target as she felt the girl’s tongue start to explore the 
depths of her mouth. <i>So that was her goal,</i> Natsuki noted as she let out a light 
chuckle, the motions of which Shizuru seemed to find quite enjoyable.</p><p>Deciding to 
simply let the girl have her fun, Natsuki allowed herself to relax and concentrate on all 
the sensations Shizuru was eliciting in her. The feeling of her tongue against the back of 
her mouth, even occasionally tickling the back of throat, was an obvious and quite enjoyable 
one. Moving beyond that a bit, there were Shizuru’s lips pressed up tightly against hers, 
not moving too much as most of Shizuru’s concentration was focused on her tongue. It was 
still quite nice feeling them though, especially with how well their mouths fit together 
with Shizuru’s head bent this way, almost as if they were made for each.</p><p><i>Bah, what 
do I mean “as if”? I don’t think I have any question left that we definitely are made for 
just each other.</i> Natsuki would have smiled at this pleasant thought if her mouth were in 
any position that allowed it to move, so she decided to show her happiness in another way. 
She shifted her left leg to the side and under Shizuru’s body, and then wrapped it around 
her. Grasping her intent, Shizuru shifted her body up onto the bed, allowing Natsuki’s right 
leg to join its partner in clasping Shizuru against her. The movement caused a few sharp 
pains in her feet, but Natsuki was far beyond caring.</p><p>Natsuki’s hands were already 
pressed against the back of Shizuru’s head – and relishing the lovely texture of Shizuru’s 
soft chestnut locks while they were at it – so Natsuki only had to bring her elbows up over 
Shizuru’s shoulders to maximize the contact of her arms. Finally in a position where she had 
completely maximized the contact of her body with Shizuru’s, Natsuki allowed herself a moan 
of delight. She could certainly get used to snuggling with the girl like this, and she could 
barely wait until she got the chance to spend a night sleeping with her again.</p><p>The 
thought of this next occasion brought with it a reminder of what she’d promised she’d allow 
Shizuru to do to her before that happened, causing a wave of heat to rush to her face. A 
little voice in the back of Natsuki’s head expressed disappointment that with how focused 
Shizuru was on the kiss, she wouldn’t get to see this blush, but the much louder voice of 
Natsuki’s modesty promptly shut it up and started fretting about what Shizuru had planned 
for her.</p><p>As these carnal thoughts invaded Natsuki’s mind, her attention was drawn to a 
lower part of her body which was now pressed up against Shizuru courtesy of the position her 
legs were in. There was some extra warmth there – the kiss was definitely having an effect 
on her – but it didn’t feel like it was enough that she’d be comfortable overcoming her 
modesty to let Shizuru in. It was a little worrying, and Natsuki started to fear that it 
wouldn’t be any better on Friday, when she’d promised to let Shizuru go further.</p><p>Maybe 
it was just that she was missing the build-up. When pleasuring Shizuru, she hadn’t gone 
straight for the goal. All her research told her that she was supposed to play around a bit 
first, and that had certainly seemed to work. That was probably the whole point of it then: 
to get the other girl excited enough that she wasn’t afraid to let the other in.<i>Ugh, why 
do I have to be such an idiot sometimes? Of course that’s the point, and I’m sure Shizuru 
will know that herself and make sure I… oh…</i></p><p>A wave of pleasure coursed through 
Natsuki’s body as she felt Shizuru’s lips press against her collar bone. She’d been too lost 
in though to notice Shizuru had left her mouth, but she certainly wasn’t complaining about 
this new sensation. It was as if Shizuru were reading her mind and confirming that yes, she 
was well aware of what she’d have to do to get her fully in the mood.</p><p>Natsuki felt 
like she was drowning in the sensations Shizuru was eliciting in her as she trailed kisses 
along her collarbone and up the side of her neck. If Shizuru were to press her much further, 
she didn’t know if she’d be able to resist, or even if she wanted to. One small part of her 
mind tried to complain that they were supposed to wait until Friday so they’d be free to 
sleep together afterwards, but its tiny voice was barely heard over the waves of pleasure 
coursing through her body at Shizuru’s caresses.</p><p>The small voice was vindicated 
however, when a sharp knocking jolted Natsuki out of her daze. Shizuru seemed to be stunned 
as well, and as Natsuki’s eyes focused on her face, she saw a grimace of what looked like 
anger forming on it. <i>Could that be the pizza already?</i> Natsuki wondered. <i>How long 
have we been kissing?</i> She turned her head to check the clock as she felt Shizuru 
crawling off of her to go answer the door. She hadn’t checked the time when Shizuru left to 
order the pizza, though, but it had been at least half an hour since they’d arrived. However 
she split it, it had easily been long enough for the pizza to get there, assuming Shizuru 
had ordered from a nearby store.</p><p>From the expression she’d seen on Shizuru’s face, 
Natsuki was a bit concerned for the delivery boy. However, Shizuru was a master at 
controlling her emotions, so surely she wouldn’t be too hard on him. Natsuki heard the door 
opening and some muffled voices making their way into her room. No yelling, so she let out a 
little sigh of relief. After a moment, she heard the door close and Shizuru strolled back 
into her bedroom, a mischievous smile on her face.</p><p>“Now, I believe Natsuki promised me 
that she’d let me carry her around her dorm,” Shizuru said, a dangerous look forming in her 
eye. Natsuki gulped in barely-restrained fear. She trusted Shizuru not to do anything to 
hurt her or that really made her uncomfortable, but unfortunately she also trusted her to 
push her limits as far as she could, and she had a sinking feeling she was about to 
experience just that.</p><p>Shizuru approached her and hooked one arm under Natsuki’s knees 
and the other behind her back, lifting her up much as she had earlier that day when Natsuki 
had first been injured. <i>Okay, this isn’t so bad,</i> Natsuki thought as Shizuru started 
to carry her out to the kitchen. As she looped her arms around Shizuru’s shoulders to steady 
herself, the girl suddenly snuck her head in to steal a quick kiss. It brought a light blush 
to Natsuki’s cheeks, but mostly it caused her to relax as she figured that was as bad as the 
teasing was going to get.</p><p>Of course, she really shouldn’t have underestimated Shizuru. 
Instead of placing Natsuki down at the place she’d set up for her, Shizuru simply pulled out 
her own chair and sat down, allowing Natsuki to come to rest in her lap. The blush on 
Natsuki’s face deepened as she realized the extent of Shizuru’s game, but the only response 
it got from the girl was a lilting, “Well, shall we eat?”</p><p>Natsuki glared at Shizuru, 
but got only a pleasant, if devious, smile in return. Shizuru didn’t wait long for her, 
though, as she opened up the pizza box and withdrew two slices from it, one for her and one 
for Natsuki, and placed them on her plate. The ploy didn’t please Natsuki however, and she 
demanded, “Are you going to force me to walk to my seat myself?”</p><p>“Ara?” Shizuru said, 
her face a mask of perfect innocence. “Why would Natsuki wish to do that?”</p><p>Natsuki 
knew if she told the truth she would be subjected to Shizuru’s pout and end up giving in, 
regardless of the fact that she knew that it was coming and would be fake. She struggled 
briefly for an excuse that might get her off the hook, and went with the first thing that 
crossed her mind. “Because if I sit right here, I won’t have enough room to eat pizza while 
looking into those beautiful crimson eyes of yours.” She batted her eyelids for added 
effect, and fortunately Shizuru simply blushed at this rather then breaking out into 
laughter at her performance.</p><p>“Ara, I’m going to hold you to that, you know,” Shizuru 
said, bringing her eyes up to meet Natsuki’s. As she got up and carried Natsuki over to her 
own seat, maintaining eye contact the whole time, Natsuki noted to herself that it would be 
breaking eye contact so she could properly pick up the pizza that would be the problem. 
There was something hypnotic about them that threatened to draw her in, and at this moment, 
she wasn’t sure that was such a bad thing.</p><p>The spell was broken when Shizuru put her 
down and turned away to head back to her seat. Taking advantage of her free moment, Natsuki 
snatched her slice of pizza off of Shizuru’s plate in case the girl demanded her eye contact 
again as soon as she sat down. Although she did immediately meet Natsuki’s gaze when she sat 
back down, offering her a loving smile, the hypnotic effect of her eyes was mercifully 
lessened with distance.</p><p>“So, I guess it would be appropriate for us to try to get to 
know each other better on our first date,” Shizuru said. After taking a bite of her slice of 
pizza – she of course used a fork and knife for it rather than something as ungraceful as 
picking it up with her hands – she continued, “But it seems to me that after her 
explorations last Saturday, Natsuki must already know all she could about me. I might just 
have to even the scores tonight.”</p><p>“Huh?” Natsuki said through a mouthful of pizza as 
she gave Shizuru a blank look and tried to puzzle out what she meant. Catching her 
confusion, Shizuru gave Natsuki a sultry wink to emphasize her point, prompting a fierce 
blush in the girl as she figured it out. She gulped down her pizza and snapped, “Oh no, you 
don’t! I told you no sneak peaks until Friday, and I’m sticking to that. Besides, it’s not 
as if I actually spent that much time learning about you; I was too busy just focusing on 
what you needed that I… I… really should learn when to shut up.” Natsuki covered up her 
embarrassment by quickly shoving what remained of her slice of pizza into her mouth, keeping 
her eyes well away from Shizuru.</p><p>Either Shizuru decided to be merciful or she was as 
stunned by Natsuki’s admission as Natsuki was to have made it, as she refrained from comment 
on this matter. She continued eating for a few minutes in silence. After she got out her 
second slice of pizza and Natsuki had finally worked up the courage to face her again, she 
tried a different line of conversation. “How about this: Ask anything you want about me, 
Natsuki. Fujino Shizuru is an open book to you tonight.”</p><p>Natsuki paused in her pizza 
binge to consider this for a moment. What didn’t she already know about Shizuru? She’d 
already figured out quite well what her deepest secret was, and a lot of her other private 
thoughts seemed to revolve around that one as well. On the other end, there were the aspects 
of herself that everyone knew about: her green tea addiction, her manipulative personality, 
her graceful Kyoto breeding… aha! There was one thing. “Tell me about your family, Shizuru,” 
Natsuki said. “Where do you come from?”</p><p>Natsuki noticed a slight twitch in Shizuru’s 
smile. It was subtle, but it seemed that she approved of Natsuki’s choice of questions. 
“Well, as you probably know, the Fujinos are a very successful Kyoto family. When the 
technology boom was just starting up, my mother’s parents sniffed the breeze and jumped 
right in. We’ve been well-off ever since. Of course, they didn’t let the success go to their 
heads, and they kept close to their traditional Japanese roots, and this extended through my 
mother.”</p><p>“Wait a second,” Natsuki cut in, swallowing her current mouthful of pizza. 
“Your mother’s parents? They’re the Fujinos?”</p><p>“Ara, I was getting to that,” Shizuru 
said. Her face barely budged, but a twinkle in her eye hinted that she was proud of Natsuki 
for catching that point. “Meanwhile, my father was born to an American immigrant and the 
Japanese beauty who’d convinced him to stay in the country. They had started up their own 
business, and they were moderately successful.</p><p>“Eventually they came to the attention 
of my parents, and they got into talks about merging their business into Fujino 
Technologies. For some reason I’ll never know, my mother’s parents were somehow charmed by 
my father, and they made the suggestion of an arranged marriage between him and their eldest 
daughter, my mother. It was quite the surprise to both my father and his parents. You see, 
my father is…” Shizuru seemed to struggle for the best way to explain her father, “…not very 
Japanese,” she settled on begrudgingly.</p><p>Feeling her input was required at this point, 
Natsuki piped up between bites, “How so?”</p><p>Shizuru paused for a moment to consider 
this. “Well, he picked up a lot of American values from his father, along with some other 
characteristics that I think it’s best you see for yourself when I take you to meet him.” 
Before Natsuki could protest this plan, Shizuru quickly continued, “But the result was that 
he never had much luck with Japanese girls. He was also the hopeless romantic sort, and so 
when this opportunity came up, he convinced both his parents and my mother to give things a 
chance between them. If the relationship worked out, great, if not, they didn’t really need 
to worry about the arranged marriage in any case; it was simply a suggestion to help cement 
the merger, rather than a requirement.</p><p>“Well, as you can probably guess, my father 
eventually was able to win over my mother’s heart. To my mother’s surprise, he was actually 
quite the charmer. His biggest problem was simply that he’d never had a girl give him a 
chance before her. Too many parents were frightened of a half-American oddball like him and 
chased him off.”</p><p>By this time, Natsuki had finished up her final slice of pizza, 
though Shizuru had spent more time talking and was thus only halfway done. She stepped in at 
this point and inquired, “So what about your mother, then? What’s she like?”</p><p>“For the 
most part, she’s what you’d expect of a traditional Kyoto lady,” Shizuru said, causing a 
picture of an aged Shizuru to flash through Natsuki’s mind. “She has a younger brother and 
sister, and they’re more the wild ones of the family, so she settled into being the mature, 
responsible one. I think she secretly always wished she were as carefree as her siblings, 
and maybe that’s part of what drew her to my father. He was able to bring some of that out 
in her over time, as well.</p><p>“Anyways, you were wondering about how I ended up with the 
Fujino name,” Shizuru said, after taking a short break to finish up her third slice of 
pizza. Natsuki nodded at this, and after taking a first bite of her final piece, Shizuru 
continued, “Well, my father really wanted to impress my mother’s parents – not realizing 
that he’d already done quite enough by helping to bring my mother out of her shell a little 
– and he brought up an old tradition where if the husband in a marriage were from a 
lower-class family, he would take his wife’s name. My mother was too flattered to object, 
and her parents couldn’t talk him out of it, so that’s how we ended up being the 
Fujinos.”</p><p>“What a nice story you have,” Natsuki idly commented as her thoughts drifted 
to her own situation. She’d been quite literally sold out by her mother – if she could trust 
Smith, which was more than a little doubtful – and then all but abandoned by her father. 
Maybe it would be a bit better if she decided to trust her mother’s love over Smith, but she 
was still dead in any case. “I wish I had a family like that…” she sighed.</p><p>“You 
could,” Shizuru said, snapping her out of her reverie. She immediately started to look 
embarrassed about what she’d said, and she didn’t offer anything more as she finished up her 
last slice of pizza.</p><p>“What? What do you mean?” Natsuki pressed.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” 
Shizuru said. Her eyes were downcast, avoiding Natsuki’s gaze. It was quite unusual to see 
the girl acting like this. “I’m getting ahead of myself. It’s just, I was thinking… I know 
my parents would really love you.”</p><p>Natsuki was stunned by this for a good minute. 
Multiple thoughts raced through her mind, including fear at the prospect of meeting 
Shizuru’s parents, fear of what she and Shizuru would have to do to make her legitimately a 
part of their family, and surprisingly a little disappointment that the current Japanese 
laws wouldn’t allow it. But there was something tempting about the prospect, and seeing 
Shizuru’s discomfort at having said this, she decided to choose this point to tell Shizuru. 
“It would be nice to have a family, I guess,” she said, giving a soft sigh. “I don’t even 
have Duran anymore now…”</p><p>Natsuki was pleased to see relief course through Shizuru’s 
expression. She thought she caught that mischievous glint for a moment, but if it was there, 
it was quickly suppressed. “Thank you, Natsuki,” Shizuru said. She was apparently well aware 
that Natsuki had chosen those words for her benefit. A slight frown then appeared on her 
face as she said, “Ara, I guess now’s as good a time as any to tell you, but my mother’s 
coming up to visit me on Thursday, so I won’t be able to spend time with you 
then.”</p><p>“Oh,” Natsuki said. She could feel herself deflating at this news, but she 
didn’t bother hiding her disappointment from Shizuru. She could find something to do… 
probably. She did have other friends who might be available.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Shizuru 
said, only slightly relieving Natsuki’s disappointment. “There is one thing I did want to 
ask you relating to that, though,” she continued tentatively. “I still haven’t told anyone 
about our relationship, as you requested, and that includes my parents. In fact, they still 
don’t even know that I prefer girls. With the way things are going between us, it really 
seems like it’s about time I tell them at least that much, but I wanted to make sure you 
were okay with it.”</p><p>She couldn’t put her finger on the why of it, but Natsuki felt a 
blush forming on her face at this. It was something about the way Shizuru was acting, 
possibly, like a scared little girl worried about what her parents thought. A wave of warmth 
rushed through Natsuki at the realization that Shizuru was willing to reveal this weaker 
side of herself to her. Allowing a small smile to form on her face, she got up from her 
chair and walked over to Shizuru, forgetting all about the fact that her feet were supposed 
to hurt.</p><p>When she reached the girl, Natsuki knelt down and wrapped her in a hug. “Of 
course I’m okay with you telling them, Shizuru,” she whispered into her girlfriend’s ear. “I 
don’t know why you might think I’d have a problem with that.”</p><p>“Thank you, Natsuki,” 
Shizuru said, still a bit hesitant. “It’s just that, there’s a chance it might lead to 
questions of if I’m seeing anyone, and I wouldn’t want to lie.”</p><p>“Oh,” Natsuki said, 
considering this for a minute. “Well, I guess I don’t mind if you tell your mother about me, 
if this is that important to you.” She gave Shizuru her most encouraging smile, and she saw 
her friend’s face light up from her permission.</p><p>“Natsuki is too sweet,” Shizuru said, 
her voice almost breaking. Before Natsuki could even start to blush, she leaned in to 
punctuate this with a sweet kiss that made Natsuki forget what she was supposed to be 
embarrassed about.</p>
