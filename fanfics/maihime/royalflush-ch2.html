    <p>Youko was given the task of explaining   the rules prior to the shuffling of cards, all the while holding Midori’s   gaze and her skin had pinked with a slight blush. She wasn’t sure   that Midori’s suggestion that she join the game had wholly innocent   but it was a risk she was willing to take. After all, she was the one   mixing the drinks.</p>
    <p>“Ok ladies, the game is fairly   simple so let’s try to relax and have fun,” Midori said, catching   the eyes of both Shizuru and Natsuki as she skillfully dealt out five   cards to each HiME in attendance. She had separated the two because   the latter was still leveling her frostiest glares at the student council   president.</p>
    <p>Natsuki had pitched a royal fit   earlier when she heard those two words, “What the bloody--? No. Absolutely   not. I am not getting naked in any way shape or form. And neither are   you,” she said in her best commanding tone as she stared at Shizuru.   The pretty kaichou simply raised an amused eyebrow at her outburst but   remained suspiciously silent.</p>
    <p>“What’s the matter, Kuga?   Worried that we might get to see more than you?” Nao had snarked from   her place on one the oversized armchairs near the playing table.</p>
    <p>“Sounds like you need the peek.   Lost your taste for pedophiles, Nao?</p>
    <p>Things went precipitously downhill   from there. “Nao-san, Kuga-san, please!” piped up a rather annoyed   Yukino (who somehow managed to get out of her “duties” with Haruka).   “This is supposed to be fun. Can you both...well, you know,” she   gave them both a meaningful look. The two of them were so shocked at   Yukino’s sudden growth of a spine that they acquiesced almost immediately   (not without some mouthed threats to each other, to be sure).</p>
    <p>The group around a small circular   table they had found in a student study lounge resembled a motley crew   of misfits. Youko sat on Midori’s right while Nao sat on her left.   Then it was Shizuru, Chie, Yukino, Yukariko, Mai, Mikoto and finally   Natsuki.</p>
    <p>“Why are <em>you</em> here, Harada?”   Natsuki observed the campus busybody sitting next to Shizuru for the   first time since they sat down to play. She was very uncomfortable with   the prospect of having semi-nude photos of herself floating around the   school. “Don’t you have someplace to be? Where’s Aoi anyway? You   two are usually joined at the hip.”</p>
    <p>Chie peered intently at her cards   as she tried to hide the disappointment in her face at the mention of   her crush’s name. “She had to work,” she replied quietly. “No   worries, though, Kuga, I’ll behave this time, eh?”</p>
    <p>Dubious looks all round were cast   in her direction. Chie spread her hands in exasperation. “What? I <em> can</em> be good when I want to! Gods know, this would make some excellent   stuff but…my heart isn’t in it this time.”</p>
    <p>“Uh huh,” Mai gave a derisive   snort. “If I hear any smart comments from Tate about tonight, I’ll   know who to come after, good behaviour or not.”</p>
    <p>Youko continued outlining the   rules of play as she handed out drinks to those who weren’t already   drinking tea. “Now remember to keep your cards well hidden. Only discard   the cards you think might not be worth anything. The max number of cards   you can get rid of for this game is three cards unless you have an ace.   Then you can get rid of four and hold onto that ace. Do you all understand   the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_%28poker%29" target="_blank"><u>hand values</u></a> that I explained before?”</p>
    <p>Everyone nodded their assent.   Midori handed out cards to the last person, put the rest of the deck   to the side and placed a marker, or marked poker chip, on top. “We’ll   be playing five card draw poker with deuces wild.”</p>
    <p>Yukariko’s hand raised tentatively   from behind her cards. “Yes, Sister?” the wayward teacher acknowledged.</p>
    <p>“Um, what’s a deuce?”</p>
    <p>The rest of the evening played   out like a Benny Hill skit. Mikoto had to be sent back to Mai’s room   before the first hand was played when she kept trying to eat her cards.   Yukariko acted so jumpy at the possibility of committing multiple grievous   sins while gambling on her state of undress that, at the suggestion   of Midori, the lovely doctor had to slip her a shot of sake in her tea   to calm her down.</p>
    <p>Chie, Nao and Midori were doing   their level best to see who could out-bluff the other; however, their   efforts were for naught as they were the first players to fall. Natsuki   and Shizuru continued their silent war of wills, surprising everyone   else by their smart, calculated moves despite both of their protestations   that they’d never played poker before in their lives.</p>
    <p>Youko was the first one to be   completely naked, much to the amusement of a broadly grinning Midori.   The bets were getting more outrageous the more alcohol that was consumed.   Three rounds later, Nao and Yukino lost their clothing as Shizuru’s   calculated bluff with a pair of tens, ace high, forced them to go all   in and call. Nao’s screams of frustration could be heard throughout   most of the dorm.</p>
    <p>It was the final hand of the last   round; Shizuru and Natsuki had yet to lose a stitch. Most of the other   HiME had either opted to fold when they thought their hands would not   be able to stand up to the pair’s collective cunning or lost when   they attempted to take a risk that one of the two was bluffing outrageously.   Midori had a bemused expression on her face as she handed them their   cards. Natsuki took one look at her cards and a brief flash of excitement   flickered in her eyes.</p>
    <p>“Natsuki, I’ve heard that   certain body language between players are called ‘tells’. Perhaps   you shouldn’t be quite so obvious about what you might be holding   in your hand,” Shizuru joked.</p>
    <p>The younger girl blushed furiously.   “Think you know so much, do you? Very well,” she purred. “I’m   going all in.” She pushed her rather large stack of poker chips into   the center of the table where the ‘pot’ was.</p>
    <p>Shizuru blinked at the size of   Natsuki’s bet. “Are you <em>sure</em> you want to do that?”</p>
    <p>“I’ve never been surer about   anything in my life.”</p>
    <p>Everyone around the table held   their breath as Midori laid down the challenge. “You two know the   drill. Show us what you’ve got.”</p>
    <p>Shocked gasps hissed out as Shizuru   laid her cards down first. “Well, damn,” Chie grumbled. “Full   house: three Kings and two tens. Now what are the odds of THAT happening?”</p>
    <p>“Not so fast,” Natsuki said   with a smirk that nearly split her face in two. She laid down her own   set of cards. If the reaction to Shizuru’s hand was shock, then the   reaction to Natsuki’s was awe.</p>
    <p>“What the bloody---?” “How   did she get THAT? She can’t have that!” “Are you kidding me?”</p>
    <p>“Straight flush. Ace, King,   Queen, Jack, and Ten of Hearts. Looks like I win, kaichou-sama.”</p>
    <p>“Ara, it’s not like Natsuki   to be a sore winner.”</p>
    <p>“Hmph. Cut the crap, I beat   you. You know what you gotta do…”</p>
    <p>“Whatever do you mean?” Shizuru   asked as she placed her hand over her ample bosom and gave her friend   a faux innocent look.</p>
    <p>“Strip. Now!” Natsuki growled.</p>
    <p>“I don’t see point you’re   trying to make. You’ve seen me without clothing numerous times,”   Shizuru complained with her bottom lip protruding in a slight pout.</p>
    <p>Chie’s eyes lit up with all   of the gossip possibilities being laid out before her, her earlier promise   almost completely forgotten. “Ehhh, Kuga? When was this? Why didn’t   you tell us about your hot love affair with the lovely student council   president?” she teased, poking the grumpy student in the side with   her elbow.</p>
    <p>&quot;Shut UP! Shizuru, the POINT   is that I beat you and now you...h-have to take off your clo--damn,   this game is pathetic. Why the hell am I playing along with this?&quot;   she groused and stood up to face down her wily <em>sempai</em>.</p>
    <p>“Aw Natsuki-san is all flustered,”   Nao grinned nastily as she took out her camera phone. “Could it be   that she’s enjoying this a little more than she lets on? Huu huu huuu…”</p>
    <p>Natsuki whirled on the red-haired   girl so fast, she barely had time to duck or risk being cold cocked   in the chin. “Shut your mouth before I shut it for you.” She gave   the wannabe badass a parting glare before standing and stomping off   to the common room kitchen. Her ears burned with embarrassment as she   heard Shizuru say, “Natsuki’s leaving just when I’ve gotten to   the good part? How mean.” She slammed the kitchen door so hard the   artwork on the walls nearly flew off.</p>
    <p>“Oh my,” Yukino mused while   trying to cover her nudity with one of the sofa cushions.</p>
    <p>“Whadda we do now?” Youko   slurred. Though she’d had fewer glasses of the alcoholic punch mixture   that she had made, somehow she felt more inebriated than she should.</p>
    <p>“Don’t worry,” Shizuru said   calmly. “I am the one she is upset with so…” She straightened   her skirt and headed off in the direction Natsuki fled to.</p>
    <p>When she was out of earshot, the   rest of the group looked at each other in consternation. “I don’t   know if I respect her for her courage or think she’s totally insane   for going after Kuga,” Chie noted. Yukariko, nodded vigorously in   agreement, hiccupped twice and passed out cold in Chie’s lap.</p>
    <p>“Whoa, what’s going on here?”</p>
    <p>Everyone’s eyes whipped around   to see a very confused Aoi standing in the doorway of the common room.   Her own eyes went as wide as saucers as she took in the collective nudity   of the group. Chie jumped up from her chair in a panic, heedless of   her own state of undress.</p>
    <p>“Aoi! Look, I can explain everything!”</p>
