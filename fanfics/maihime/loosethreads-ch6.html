<h1>A Mai HiME Fiction: Loose Threads (part 6 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/arcajeth.html">Arca Jeth</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/loosethreads-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Fujino Shizuru&#39;s attention was always on the details. From chartering 
her family&#39;s fastest business jet, to recruiting a classmate to take 
notes for her while she was away from university for the overnight trip, 
the former-student council president took care to solve all of life&#39;s 
little problems. It gave her time to ponder the larger problems. Such 
as why her breakfast companion and love of her life, Kuga Natsuki, was 
staring off into space with a clearly unhappy expression.

Shizuru watched as Natsuki absently toyed with the fresh fruit on her 
plate. She would occasionally pick up a strawberry and bring it 
tantalizingly close to her lovely lips, but then change her mind and put 
it back down.

The former student council president was at a loss as to what was 
bothering her love. Were the fresh flowers, hand-made tablecloth, 
silver tea service and fully liveried butler too much? Shizuru didn&#39;t 
believe so.

Perhaps it was the strange looks the couple was getting from the other 
diners, in the middle of the Fuuka Gakuen cafeteria.

&quot;I might have over done it again,&quot; Shizuru said aloud.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Natsuki awoke from her ruminations. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s not that...but next 
time, I think we can do without the violin player.&quot;

Shizuru winced as if wounded in the heart. *I KNEW I should have ordered 
the viola instead.*

&quot;You should let me spoil you more often,&quot; she said as she picked up a 
croissant and buttered it before offering it to her raven-haired 
companion.

&quot;Th-thanks.&quot; Shizuru thought Natsuki&#39;s blush prettily set off her ivory 
skin. She was quite Pleased that *she* had been the one to put it there.

&quot;Natsuki, what is it?&quot; Shizuru asked, all hints of teasing gone from her 
voice.

&quot;It shows that much?&quot; 

&quot;You were also distracted last night,&quot; Shizuru replied. &quot;Despite all my 
efforts to keep you...focused.&quot;

Natsuki squirmed under Shizuru&#39;s soft interrogation. Her love would 
never force the truth from her, but Fujino Shizuru would likewise never 
give up easily. If something was bothering Natsuki, Shizuru would not 
allow her to suffer in silence. 

&quot;It&#39;s Tokiha Mai,&quot; Natsuki said quietly. &quot;I think she&#39;s in serious 
trouble.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Tokiha Mai, sewing was much like life. If it tore mend it. Mai was 
good at mending things. New hems for skirts, new buttons for blouses and 
sweaters, she could even darn socks if needed. But what happened when 
something didn&#146;t tear along the seam? 

&quot;Do what you can to repair the damage and try to hide your stitches,&quot; 
Mai recalled as she sewed. 

It was before classes and Mai was in the home economics sewing lab 
mending uniforms. While she could just as easily have worked in her 
room, Mai preferred the larger machines here.

Besides, she preferred the solitude here. Nothing but the toneless hum 
and click of the machines. She searched her sewing box for another 
button. Mikoto seemed to be loosing a lot of those lately. She&#39;d have 
to talk to the feral girl about it later.

&quot;Routine communication,&quot; Mai said bitterly to herself. &quot;That&#39;s what 
we&#39;re reduced to.&quot; 

She and her closest friend barely spoke to each other now. When Mikoto 
would come home she&#39;d regale her roommate with news from her classes to 
the antics of her fellow students. No more. 

Mai was lucky to get a good morning out of her. But there was more. 
Sometimes the younger girl would come home late with no explanation. 
She&#39;d simply take a bath and go to sleep. 

She was losing Mikoto, and it was her own fault. With the realization 
came pain, a pain that seared Mai&#39;s heart. 

After the HiME Festival, Tokiha Mai had done her best to mend the pieces 
of her life into something resembling a complete tapestry. However, the 
image that emerged was a jumbled collage of patterns; none of which 
seemed to match. She had unconsciously traced one pattern which kept 
reappearing, Mikoto. Then, in a moment of emotional confusion, she&#39;d 
done a terrible thing. A tear papered on her very life.

Yet, the tear on her life was not along the seams. She&#39;d done her best 
to mend it and only succeeded in widening the tear. Now, as she tried 
to hide her stitches she&#39;d done another terrible thing. One that she 
couldn&#39;t take back.

Mai picked up another skirt, whose hem was unraveling. A thread had come 
loose and the more it was pulled, the worse the damage became. 

&quot;It was fine,&quot; Mai whispered. &quot;Why did I have to pull that thread? Why 
couldn&#39;t I leave it alone?&quot; The light-grey fabric darkened to black as 
moisture seeped through. Mai hugged the skirt to her breast.

&quot;Forgive me...&quot;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Natsuki sat quietly contemplating her breakfast while Shizuru was busy 
on her cell phone. After hearing about Natsuki&#39;s evening encounter with 
Mai, Shizuru had been on the phone for the last ten minutes. 

&quot;What exactly are you doing?&quot; Natsuki finally asked.

Shizuru paused and turned her lovely red gaze upon her love. &quot;Tokiha-san 
isn&#39;t the type of person to say what&#39;s bothering her. I&#39;m afraid the 
situation is too volatile to wait for her to say it on her own.&quot; Shizuru 
smiled pleasantly. &quot;Since investigations like these aren&#39;t my forte&#39; I&#39;m 
calling in reinforcements.&quot;

&quot;Reinforcements?&quot; Natsuki queried. &quot;You don&#39;t have to go that far.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do everything I can for one of Natsuki&#39;s beloved friends,&quot; Shizuru 
answered. &quot;I&#39;m a bit ashamed really.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Natsuki asked as she watched Shizuru&#39;s lips form a frown.

&quot;Because my heart was only big enough for Natsuki, I hurt people, made 
them suffer.&quot; Shizuru&#39;s smile returned as she reached over to caress 
Natsuki&#39;s cheek. &quot;But your heart is big enough to let others in. That&#39;s 
just another reason why I love you so much.&quot;

Shizuru went back to her call, leaving Natsuki with a small pang of 
loss. Right then, she&#39;d wanted to pour her feelings out in front of 
everyone. Shizuru had that effect on her. *I made the right choice, 
letting her in.* 

Yet, the question of exactly *whom* Shizuru was calling for 
&quot;reinforcements&quot; nagged at Natsuki. An army of detectives perhaps? 
Shizuru never could do anything on a small scale. 

&quot;I&#39;m delivering a speech to the Tea Ceremony Club this afternoon, but I 
could put them off...&quot; Shizuru said into the phone. &quot;All right, that 
will be lovely. I&#39;m glad to have an investigator of your caliber working 
on this case.&quot;

*Is it Scotland Yard?* Natsuki wondered incredulously.

&quot;Thank you for your kindness in this matter Harada-san. Give my best to 
Senou-san.&quot;

Shizuru closed her phone and resumed her meal.
