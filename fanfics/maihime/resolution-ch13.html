<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Upon  preliminary research, I found that the Japanese legal system is  heavily modeled after the American system, a reform which occurred  shortly after World War 2.  If the brief legal reference herein seems  flawed to anybody, please let me know by messaging me.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally,  it seems to me that this chapter will be largely a transitional  chapter, going from point-A in Goza to point-B at the beach.  </span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Pay no  mind to the distant thunder / new day fills his head with wonder /  says “it feels right this time”</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Then it  comes to be / that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel / is  just a freight train coming your way</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No-leaf  clover</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As odd  as it was, Midori had never seen Natsuki pointing a real gun at  somebody before.  Sure, everybody had seen her with those shrimpy  little ice-guns before, seen her use them to great effect.  She had  loved those little guns, and somehow, Midori couldn’t picture her  using anything aside from them as weapons.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Obviously,  this was impossible now, but it still struck Midori as odd to see her  now, pointing what Midori judged (using her extensive knowledge of  modern weaponry) to be a Big Freaking Hand Cannon at a man that she  had never seen before.  She wasn’t particularly shocked—she was,  in fact, angry enough that she would have pulled the trigger herself  at that moment, given the opportunity, just for the curiosity of  seeing something aside from her emotional (and possibly hormonal)  balance die a painful death—but it occurred to her in some far-off  portion of her brain that there were a dozen or more cops not a block  away from where they were. In a country in which a gun of any sort,  much less a Big Freaking Hand Cannon, was illegal, this was a  problem.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  actually took Midori a moment longer to realize that Natsuki was  holding Shizuru in her arms.  Somehow it made a smaller impact on her  brain than the hand cannon, in spite of the fact that she really knew  nothing of whatever dynamic existed between the two of them.  (Though, being fair, nobody really knew much of anything about the  dynamic between Shizuru and Natsuki.  Not even Shizuru and Natsuki.)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It took  her a moment longer to realize that the way in which Shizuru was  being held was most definitely <em>not </em>one of undying friendship.  Natsuki’s hand—the hand not pointing the gun at the man whose  only crime appeared to Midori to be dressing badly—was pressed  gently around the back of Shizuru’s neck, buried slightly under her  hair.  Shizuru had both of her hands around Natsuki’s lower waist.  Both of them were <em>way </em>past that “friendly hug” line that  separated the middle back from the place that a boyfriend might rest  his hand to mark his territory in public.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somehow,  this didn’t entirely surprise her. <em>All things considered, I  probably should have caught on that there was something more than a  mildly awkward friendship between the two of them, seeing as how she  went half-batty as soon as she figured out that Shizuru had  disappeared, </em>Midori thought with a shockingly powerful feeling of  detachment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oi,”  she called out.  Her voice was remarkably apathetic, which surprised  her.  “Are you going to shoot him right out here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  was too busy trying alternative methods of murder—by way of glaring  a hole through Minoru’s skull—to listen. Shizuru, however, turned  her head to face Midori.  She didn’t say anything; there wasn’t  really much to say.  She did, however, nod, and a moment later, she  whispered something in Natsuki’s ear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  didn’t visibly react, but she did lower her weapon after a moment.  She didn’t relax.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  didn’t, either.  He was fingering something at his waist.  It was  like one of those American western-showdown movies, Midori thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  did you kidnap Shizuru?” Natsuki said, her voice loud enough to be  imposing.  Her gun was at her hip, loosely hanging near her holster.  Shizuru shook her head, a little frustration showing through, but  Minoru answered anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I had  nothing to do with that,” he said, his voice equally imposing.  “I  was trying to keep that girl safe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Safe?  She was kidnapped by a bunch of cornpokes with shotguns! Are you  trying to tell me that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  shook her head and whispered something else in Natsuki’s ear.  Natsuki blinked once, twice, three times, and then shook her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  then what are you doing with the stuff in that backpack? Or are you  going to tell me that they’re just ‘tools’ as well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  had never seen Natsuki posture so much, so visibly defensive.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But then  again, she had also never seen her playing grab-ass with another  woman, so she supposed she shouldn’t allow it to take her too far  off-guard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  sighed.  “No, they’re not tools.  If you’ll put your gun up, I  think that we can talk this out without anybody else getting shot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Anybody </em>else<em>? Was somebody shot? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori’s  brain, sharper than most but still a little too clogged with her own  thoughts to be really attentive, struggled for a moment to cope with  the flood of information that refused to organize itself fully in her  head.  What she managed to put into place looked like an outline,  albeit a short one:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Point  1: Natsuki recently traveled back to the cabin, far out of her way,  to retrieve an extremely large gun, stating that Shizuru had been  kidnapped. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Point  2: Natsuki is holding a large, portable howitzer in her hand.  Presumably, the same one she retrieved. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Point  3: Natsuki went fairly well out of her head, considering that she’s  normally an even person, when Shizuru’s safety came into question.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Point  4: Natsuki is currently pointing the portable howitzer at a man that  I’ve never seen before, while holding Shizuru. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Logical  conclusion…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For  a second, Midori refused to believe the obvious conclusion. <em>Did  Natsuki actually…I thought the gun was just for…Who did Natsuki  shoot?</em> she thought.  Natsuki, however, reacted a little more  violently; she raised her weapon immediately, trained it on his head  again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  said I shot anybody?” she said very, very calmly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If  Minoru hadn’t frozen so completely, Midori was sure that he would  have been cursing himself pretty hard, judging by the look on his  face. That neat little outline that she had made in her head not a  moment before went all to shit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  look on his face was the look of a man who had just been butchered on  a witness stand at his own trial.  A man who had tried to bluff his  way out of the shit-hole and inadvertently confessed to his own crime  in the process.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Between  Shizuru and Natsuki, Shizuru was by and far the superior in  cleverness and wit, and general school-learning.  But with regards to  things that you couldn’t learn without a gun in your hand and  several people trying very hard to kill you, Natsuki surpassed  Shizuru easily.  Shizuru tried to tell Natsuki something, but Natsuki  shook her head angrily.  “This is the sniper, Shizuru. He was  watching the whole time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru’s  eyes widened in comprehension, and then narrowed again.  She let go  of Natsuki, (<em>Finally, </em>Midori thought) and turned to face him  straight.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  killed the men in the attic?” she asked.  Her voice was clear and  calm, which surprised Midori, who had expected her to be angrier,  simply judging by her reaction.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  nodded slowly, his face confused but mildly frightened, as though  somebody had threatened to beat him for taking the bus home when it  was raining out.  “I did.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was  paid to,” Minoru said as though it was obvious; a display of  insolence which, Natsuki thought, was more than a little bit out of  place.  “I was paid to…” he took a breath.  “I was paid to  observe you. To watch you.  The same person who paid me to do that  paid me to bail you out of the house.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  you did a <em>wonderful </em>job at that,” Natsuki said angrily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  wasn’t my fault.”  Minoru seemed angrier than he should have.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  why not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Because  the bastard is a motherfucking lunatic. </em>“Because my…my  employer decided that it would be a great idea to bullet through me.  There’s no accounting for taste.  I killed one of his men and had  to run.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  yet, here you are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  yet, here I am.  Are you going to kill me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  just might.”  Natsuki’s grip on the gun tightened a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito’s  voice came from behind Midori, startling the hell out of her.  It was  a good thing that she wasn’t the one holding the gun.  “No,  you’re not.”  In spite of his willingness to yield to Midori’s  overabundance of anger before, to back down, his voice was utterly  firm.  It left no room for argument, none at all.  It wasn’t a  voice that suggested an excess of ego…simply a lack of doubt.  An  abundance of certainty.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Put  your gun down, Natsuki,” Reito said with that voice.  “And come</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>towards  the front of the class to read us the introductory paragraph of your  dissertation, miss Sugiura, if you’re so certain of its validity.” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori’s  eyes widened and she spun, rounding on Reito, for an instant  expecting to see a fairly well-aged fiftysomething wearing a rather  abused old sport coat and a perpetually-inquisitional expression  rather than a handsome nineteen year old boy with a serious  expression that suggested an overall serenity about him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For a  moment, maybe she did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then  there was just Reito Kanzaki.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Butt  out, Kanzaki,” Natsuki spat back.  “This isn’t your business.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru’s  expression suggested that he kind of hoped that she would listen to  him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you kill him here, then how do you plan on finding out why Shizuru  was kidnapped?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  said nothing, knowing he was right but not wanting to, at least  immediately, concede.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  is still none of your business.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you want,” Reito said, his voice loosening a little.  “But put  your gun away.”  A little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  said nothing, for fear of angering her index finger another  quarter-inch.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Natsuki,”  Shizuru said.  “Now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  sighed and lowered her gun.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Put  it up,” Minoru called hopefully. Natsuki shot him a look, and he  added, “Please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shook her head angrily and turned away, frustrated.  Shizuru said,  “Mister Alder, would you be kind enough to join us at our cabin?  I  think there are several matters that I would like to discuss with  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  played on Minoru’s face—revulsion? only minus the illness—and  he nodded.  “Yeah, okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you.  You can come down now, Akira.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As if  from nowhere at all, Akira dropped from some perch above them all  onto the ground behind Minoru.  In another moment, she had dropped  Minoru, numbing his arms and one leg by pinching his nerves, and had  removed his weapons.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you very much,” Shizuru smiled at her.  “Reito, would you please  carry him to the van?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  looked less fazed than he probably should have, and responded simply  by nodding seriously.  He seemed to have caught onto the seriousness  of the situation remarkably quickly, and while he was, admittedly,  frightened all to hell by the callus display of—very <em>large</em>—weaponry, he had remained fairly resolute throughout.  He threw a small grin at Midori as he passed her, on his way to pick  up a weakened, violently cursing Minoru Alder, and she shook her  head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She kept  shaking it until she saw Reito again, and not a man three times his  age with a temperament far closer to his than she would have easily  admitted.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Akane  Higurashi wasn’t anybody’s first call in a crisis.  Even Kazuya,  the man she loved, the man who loved her, her fairy-tale knight in a  shining high school uniform, knew and accepted that.  If he had a  small issue that he needed to deal with, he talked to her.  If he had  an emotional problem—fairly rare in a fairly stable, uneventful  life (setting aside his post-death experience half a year previously,  an event which had not come anywhere near fazing him as it had some  of the others) such as his—he could usually turn to Akane, provided  it didn’t really concern her.  (He didn’t know what he would do  if he had a death in the family, in all honesty; the subject of death  was completely off-limits with Akane of late).  If it was something  beyond typical human psychological issues, though; something to do  with real danger, that affected real people, that was something  different.  In short, if the shit was really honestly moving towards  the fan, or maybe had splattered all over the place already, and was  in dire need of cleanup he had to go elsewhere.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  wasn’t to say that Akane didn’t try her best.  She did.  She  worked as hard as she could on any challenge that faced her, and for  the most part, she conquered them fairly well with regard to mundane  things; part-time jobs, school, even relationships.  In all these  things, Akane presented a levelheaded, eager face.  It was one thing  that he loved about her; one of the many.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  since that thing had happened to him, something had clicked off in  her head.  That thing that allowed her to deal with danger or death  in any sort of rational way, and if there was one area in which  Kazuya and Akane were not just different, but on opposite ends of a  spectrum, it was this one.  She was simply unable to deal with the  prospect of death.  Anybody’s death, really; but his especially.  She had terrible, sometimes debilitating nightmares, even now, about  what could not have been more than a ten minute experience in her  life.  On many of the nights that they had spent together, she had  awoken just so; screaming and crying out for Kazuya.  Something had  been vaguely familiar to him about the way she screamed, but he  couldn’t put his finger on it; a memory, just a fragment, that  evaporated every time he came near it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kazuya  was fairly even with regards to death and things generally so  freakishly out of the ordinary that it would send most people  screaming in the other direction.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He was  also walking ahead of Akane that day, her hand clasped firmly in his,  trying to get back to the main drag to find a toilet so that he could  relieve himself of the soda he’d slugged down earlier.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Much  later, looking back on it all, he was very, very grateful to that  soda for working its way through to his bladder so quickly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As they  approached the main drag, Akane said, “Do you smell something  funny, Kazu?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kazuya  sniffed, smelled something a little off himself.  A little bit like  what it had smelled like in the kitchen of <em>Linden Baum. </em>He  couldn’t put his finger on it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  rounded the corner of a building—some old brick-and-mortar store,  practically deserted on a day like today—and stopped, immediately,  as he saw the now-thin mob of people around what he observed to be a  burnt-out storefront. They were no more than fifty yards away from  it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Akane</em> was his first and only thought, and, as if it were a set of  instructions coded into a secret message, he read it and immediately  turned and said, “Don’t move, Akane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  cause for a momentary swell of pride in his belly that she stopped  immediately, so trusting was she in his judgment. “What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s…”<br />
      <em>Lie  or truth?</em><br />
  Kazuya  was a simple sort of man.  Things with him tended to boil down to  what he regarded to be their basic elements; white and black, right  and wrong, love and indifference. You loved somebody or you didn’t.  There was no middle ground for “Well, I’d like to love you but  that thing you do with your rabid mechanical dog really freaks me  out,” in his mind.  It was a good thing and a bad thing, usually in  alternating periods, but it was the way he was.<br />
  <em>Truth.   Always. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  a storefront out there, and,” he peered into the thinning crowd—by  now, composed of only the older residents, the now empty-nested  ex-stay-at-homes, and the town gossips were left staring at the  firemen, the ambulances, which were now tagging the last of the  ex-shoppers that hadn’t made it out of the store—and saw what he  was afraid of: Corpses.  Several of them. <em>Burning meat, </em>he  thought.<em> That’s what I smelled. </em>“It looks like there was  an explosion. And it looks like some people died. They’re—”  Akane gave a small gasp, but held her composure, “getting rid of  the people that died now.  Can we just wait here a minute until  they’re done?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In a  small, small voice, Akane said, “Don’t you have to…you know.”   It was pretty apparent that it took a lot of courage for her to say  that, to suggest that they go out anyway so that he could find a  place to pee.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  turned around, walked back behind the building, and grinned.  “I  can hold it for a few more minutes, I think.  Lets just wait here,  okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  nodded, and a sort of silent communication passed between them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Thank  you, </em>Akane said, <em>for understanding, and not thinking worse of  me for it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>There’s  nothing to thank me for, </em>Kazuya replied. <em>You are you, and you  are how you are; that’s why I can be the best that I am. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  love you,” Akane whispered, and Kazuya smiled as she pressed  herself into him, suddenly shaking a little bit.  He noticed she  pressed her nose into the fabric of his shirt a little harder than  was normal. <em>Blocking out the smell.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  love you,” he echoed, and held her there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe  Kazuya wasn’t as stable as he thought he was.  Maybe he was not  possessed of a sense of sensibility, but of devotion.  This occurred  to him later, as did many other things in his life.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  occurred to him because of what he thought as he held Akane to him,  shielding her from the fire as he had attempted to shield her from  that monster before. He knew that if it came right down to it, and  she had to fight for him again using some archaic power that he could  never possess, she would.  And he knew that he would do the same for  her.  And this is what he thought:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>This</em>,  he thought, <em>this here in my arms is something worth dying twice  for. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  didn’t notice the shadow, but the shadow certainly noticed him.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Shiho  saw the pair first.  Of all of them, she was the least emotionally  involved in Chie’s sudden recovery, and subsequently, she was the  most attentive to her surroundings.  She could understand why the  rest of them were so buffalo-eyed about the whole thing, but she  couldn’t bring herself to feel the same way.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  too…too angry.<br />
      <em>Yes,  angry.  That’s the word.</em><br />
  Angry  at her<br />
  <em>bastard</em><br />
  ‘Big  Brother.’<br />
  <em>for  being happy</em><br />
  For  ignoring her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie and  Aoi looked like a pair of lovers at that point; Aoi had Chie’s hand  clutched tightly in her own, and had taken to questioning Chie  intently about what she remembered and what she didn’t, in the kind  of carefully reckless, quizzical manner that Chie herself had refined  to an art form, albeit an abstract one.  In between dodging barrages  of deadly, hollow-point, explosive-tipped questions, Chie had just  enough time to feel a little proud of her “student.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiho  didn’t see Kazuya and Akane immediately, nor did she see the shadow  hanging over their heads as soon as it became apparent. She wasn’t  focusing on a pair of pseudo-familiar figures in what would have been  the background of a canvas rendition of the rather gruesome scene;  rather, she was focusing on Mai and Yuuichi, lost in their own little  world, a world which they seemed to define solely by their shock and  the slowly-decreasing distance between the two of them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  wondered, somewhere in the very back of her head, if they were even  aware that they were inching towards each other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the  front of her mind, she was fully aware that she was not going to  allow it.  Their hands were, almost subtly, moving towards each  other, attracted almost naturally, like hair to a balloon.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As soon  as she made this comparison, she retracted it. <em>Like it’s a law  of nature of something. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  noticed Akane when it occurred to her, out of nowhere, that not even  a year ago, she was making that comparison in reference to Yuuichi  and herself.   That it was the two of them that could be defined as <em>only natural</em>, as <em>so good together</em>.  It was behind their  backs, of course, and by <em>her </em>classmates, not his, but that  didn’t bother her. Not at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Now she  couldn’t even try to make the comparison.  It didn’t feel right  anymore.  That was when she turned away from the two of them and saw  Akane and Kazuya.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Saw  Akane and Kazuya being watched by a man in a black sweater and ski  mask, his head and the top of his shoulders hanging off of a low  rooftop, observing.  Neither big nor small, neither imposing nor  unobtrusive.  Simply a man—the shoulders were broad enough to  suggest that if the figure was indeed a woman, she was still doing  her a favor referring to her as the opposite—but not simply a man,  all at once.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe if  it was just a man leaning his head out the window, Shiho wouldn’t  have paid it any mind.  Maybe the man could have merely had a good  view of Akane’s cleavage, modest as it may be.  Maybe he could have  been looking to see if he could see the spectacle at the little strip  mall.  Maybe he could have just woken up; not a morning person, so to  speak.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But it  wasn’t just a man leaning out a window.  It was a man leaning out a  window with something in his hand.  Shiho squinted to see what it  was; long and black, with a long, parallel protrusion on the top…and  a trigger...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>GUN.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiho  screamed, and the man’s head whipped around to face her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  man’s eyes were ugly.  Spiteful. Bitter.  Even at a distance, Shiho  could see these things, as his eyes locked directly onto hers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For one  solid second, she had the overwhelming feeling that she was going to  die.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>raises  his gun and takes aim its like a firing squad out here theres nowhere  to hide<br />
  cant  run<br />
  somebody  tells him to fire<br />
  squeezes  the trigger and<br />
  cant  run<br />
  like  a law of nature those stuck in the open shall be<br />
  cant  run<br />
  torn  asunder no place to bury<br />
  cant  run<br />
  my  head </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shiho!”   Yuuichi’s voice.  Yuuichi’s hand on her shoulder.  Yuuichi’s  hand is warm.  It squeezes tight enough to let her know he’s<br />
      <em>in  pain he grits his teeth and bears the pain until he cant bear it  anymore<br />
        TOKIHA</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  feels the instinct rise in her to move towards it. She feels another,  something newer, fresher, tell her to recoil.  She does neither,  simply stands there.  Behind her, Mai looks annoyed but concerned, a  set of emotions difficult to pull off simultaneously. Annoyed because  of the position she and Yuuichi were in.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Concerned  because maybe, just maybe, she saw it too.  Maybe her head whipped  around at just the right time to see a gun barrel and a black-covered  head vanish into a window just above Akane and Kazuya, caught in some  cutsey position.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  maybe she took in more of what she saw than she thought she had.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or maybe  not.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akane  and Kazuya made their way back towards the group, looking hideously  embarrassed; Akane was positively livid, convinced that it was the  sight of herself and Kazuya, holding each other and about to…do  things that would probably make a seventh-grader scream if she saw  them, right?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Three  months ago she would have believed that.  Of late her sensibilities  had become slightly less easily offended.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Soon,  she promised him.  Some day, but someday soon.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  look on her face, though…Akane, underneath all her horrified  lividness, wanted desperately to believe that she was just shocked.  She looked like she’d seen a murderer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai set  about convincing Akane that no, Shiho had just thought that she had  seen something, that must have been it.  Or maybe, privately  confided, expressed in girlfriend code, she had been wanting not to  see something else, you know how it is, yes I know how it is, but no,  you didn’t embarrass her don’t worry about it, oh thank goodness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuichi’s  hand was still on Shiho’s shoulder.  Shiho found herself paralyzed,  unable to move for fear that if she did, the hand would leave.  Vanish.  Mai looked angry.  Angry at her, of course. Mai must hate  her.  She would never believe that there was a man with a gun  watching Akane and Kazuya a floor above them. She would think it was  all some rendition of Shiho’s mind, wouldn’t she?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And if  she was such a<br />
      <em>bitch</em><br />
  conniving  bastard, wouldn’t Yuuichi believe the same thing?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  did you see?” Yuuichi said quietly, dropping into a squat to bring  himself down to her height.  “Did you see something that scared  you?”<br />
      <em>such  a</em><br />
  Shiho,  very slowly, cautiously, like a raccoon caught stealing from a  compost heap, turned around to face him.  Carefully. <em>Please god,  don’t let this hand move.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  nodded to him mutely.  “I can’t tell you here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shook her head, meeting his eyes. <em>No, </em>her eyes said. <em>Don’t  ask me again.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  nodded.  “You can tell me later.”<br />
      <em>bitch</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you,” she whispered, feeling her knees wobble a little; weakened by  horror. At what she’d seen, of course; and at what Yuuichi had  done.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He had  been kind to her.  Even though.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even  though.</span></p>

A few  minutes later, the van pulled up next to them, bearing Natsuki,  Shizuru, Midori, and Reito.  None of them had entirely pleasant,  normal expressions on their faces.  None of them looked terribly  happy to be on vacation.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  thought, <em>This was supposed to be a fun thing; a way to get away, </em>with more than a little regret.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">More  than a lot, even.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was an odd package wrapped entirely in black cloth in the trunk, and  Natsuki warned everybody, on penalty of death, away from it. Her  voice carried an odd tone to it when she spoke.  A tone that Mai  hadn’t heard in<br />
      <em>stay  away from Fuuka Academy</em><br />
  a long  time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  drive back to the beach was long and silent.</span></p>
