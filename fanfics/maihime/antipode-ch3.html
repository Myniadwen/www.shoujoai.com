-----

The bike weaved in and out of traffic, it&#39;s rider always one to make the 
best time possible to wherever it was she was off to. With most 
passengers, not that she allowed many on the bike at all, she went slow 
and cautiously. With Fujino Shizuru, however, Natsuki knew she could go 
a little faster and push it a little more. The former kaichou was not 
weak in will and actually quite liked it when the bike really got 
moving. She&#39;d gotten very used to it over the years, and of the two of 
them, it was Shizuru who was more likely to encourage reckless bike 
behavior. Maybe she had a great deal of pent up desire for an adrenaline 
rush. Sitting around and drinking tea couldn&#39;t have been that exciting.

Natsuki parked the bike outside a small restaurant that offered outdoor 
dining without looking like it would be overly expensive. It was a 
casual little place people probably stopped by during their lunch 
breaks. Now, at dinner, it was only mildly busy. The two girls acquired 
a table and sat, gazing at the small menu.

Shizuru placed hers down within moments, always one to quickly determine 
what it was she wanted. She then sighed. Natsuki, on the other hand, 
always took at least five to ten minutes to pick something, and it would 
always be the very first thing she had been interested in. Shizuru 
simply stared at her in hopes that it would encourage her to hurry up.

&quot;What?&quot; There, discomfort was already underway.

&quot;Get the katsudon. We both know you will,&quot; Shizuru dryly said, her chin 
resting against her hand.

Natsuki shot her a glare. &quot;But the yakitori looks...&quot;

&quot;You were staring at the katsudon first. That means you will, 
inevitably, get that after sending the waitress away several times as 
you complain about needing more time to decide. So get the katsudon.&quot; It 
was like this every time they went out to have a meal together.

Natsuki waved an arm. &quot;Stop writing a rulebook for how my brain works.&quot;

&quot;Ara, I would not have enough paper to list off all your idiosyncrasies. 
I do not wish to massacre an entire forest.&quot; She idly played with a 
napkin resting on the table in the boredom that followed in the wake of 
Natsuki&#39;s indecision.

&quot;If I had food, I would throw it at you.&quot;

&quot;We would have food, if you&#39;d just get the katsudon,&quot; Fujino countered, 
her voice still largely in monotone.

A waitress appeared, and Shizuru stared at Natsuki expectantly, trusting 
that the waitress would be sent away in order for Natsuki to continue 
pondering. But the biker, simply to spite her companion, set the menu 
down, glaring at the woman across from her.

&quot;What can I get you two?&quot;

&quot;I would like the wonton ramen, please.&quot; Shizuru eagerly awaited the 
other person&#39;s choice, however.

Natsuki, arms crossed and with determination in her voice, said, &quot;I want 
the yakitori.&quot;

Shizuru rose both eyebrows in amusement, but not surprise. The waitress 
gave them a smile and walked away to instruct the cooks to begin work. 
Natsuki gave Shizuru a look of absolute triumph, arms still crossed, and 
the two spent the next several moments in silence. Shizuru finally 
cracked a small smile. &quot;You enjoy doing things just to spite me, don&#39;t 
you?&quot;

&quot;No more than you enjoy picking on the innocent.&quot;

Shizuru rolled her eyes. Emotionally challenged, perhaps, but certainly 
not innocent by anyone&#39;s standards. &quot;I figured you would do that, 
actually. At least it got you to select something in a timely fashion. 
Thank you.&quot;

Natsuki sighed. There was no winning with that woman. &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;

Shizuru leaned back in her seat and patiently waited for her meal to 
arrive while Natsuki simply resorted to gently tapping her finger 
against the side of the table. A silence followed, but it was mainly a 
comfortable one. That was probably one of the better aspects of their 
friendship &#150; they were so comfortable around one another that they could 
shut up and still be fine in each other&#39;s company. But, conversation did 
eventually spring up, and it was a most unexpected question that started 
it.

&quot;Which sentai did you pretend to be growing up?&quot; Natsuki asked.

Shizuru blinked. What kind of question was that? She&#39;d heard plenty of 
sentai-based nonsense from Midori during the period right between the 
Carnival&#146;s end and graduation, at which point the teacher began an 
expedition overseas. She was quite glad to have been able to miss the 
more embarrassing parts of that HiME Ranger stuff. All that aside, Super 
Sentai was something almost all kids watched, and she chose to entertain 
the inquiry.

&quot;I was usually the white or pink ranger,&quot; Shizuru said. &quot;Haruka was 
usually the yellow ranger in my group, otherwise I probably would have 
been that one. The yellow one was the only girl ranger that could 
fight.&quot;

&quot;Haruka? You knew her when you were little, too?&quot; Natsuki asked, raising 
an eyebrow.

Shizuru chuckled slightly, and nodded. &quot;I did. She and I went to the 
same private school back when my father was still alive and could 
endorse my education. It didn&#39;t last long, but, yes, I knew her.&quot;

&quot;Was she always...?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Shizuru said with a nod. Then she smiled. &quot;Were you always the 
pretty pink ranger, or is that a recent development?&quot;

Natsuki glared. Stupid Midori. &quot;I am not the pink ranger, and never have 
been. That was a cruel joke, and nothing more. I always played as the 
red ranger when I was a kid.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re far too indecisive to be the red one.&quot; Shizuru idly commented as 
she smiled at the waitress who was arriving with their food. Natsuki bit 
back a return comment in front of a stranger, knowing it would look 
weird for two grown women to be discussing sentai. The waitress handed 
each their dish, and flushed as Shizuru gave her a wink. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome, miss.&quot; The woman kept a smile on her own face as she 
walked away to deal with the other customers.

Natsuki huffed and then twitched the edge of her mouth up in what was 
either a snarl or a small smirk. When the waitress was gone, she said, 
&quot;Oi, what was that?&quot;

&quot;What was what?&quot; Shizuru gave her the most innocent smile imaginable.

&quot;You know what I mean. That wink you gave her. It was... perverse, to 
say the least,&quot; Natsuki explained. Not that she was jealous. Just that 
she wasn&#39;t really used to even hearing about Shizuru&#39;s love life. Well, 
that made sense, since it had largely been revolving around Natsuki, but 
surely there was more to her romantic side than that.

&quot;Ara, you never know when you might get lucky,&quot; Shizuru replied, still 
smiling. Natsuki wasn&#39;t entirely sure whether that last bit made 
reference to something dirty or not, but it was something she did not 
want to inquire further about.

Natsuki sighed as her only response. Shizuru&#39;s love life. That did raise 
a few interesting questions that Natsuki had never dared to ask. Like 
what exactly she did with that harem of hers. Or if those rumors about 
her and Reito dating in the past had been true. Then again, that second 
one didn&#39;t seem entirely likely given Shizuru&#39;s recent revelations to 
her. But who knew whether or not she was batting for the home team 
completely or switch hitting. Another question to add to the list, she 
supposed, but without the baseball terminology. Who applied baseball 
terms to sex in the first place, anyway?

&quot;Whatever,&quot; she managed to finally say. She could ask her questions 
another day. In other words, when she found the courage. She was a wuss 
when it came to all that personal stuff sometimes.

Shizuru snapped apart her chopsticks with a smile and said, &quot;My, you 
aren&#39;t jealo--&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; But that didn&#39;t mean she liked it one tiny bit.

&quot;Your loss,&quot; Shizuru said with a sigh, plucking up several noodles and 
placing them into her mouth. Natsuki merely gave her a wry smile in 
response, never really one to play into her flirting games, even if they 
were only in jest. She thought. Then again, that may have been a sign 
that things were all right. Shizuru had been refraining from such 
comments since the end of their grand adventure.

They ate quietly for some time, simply content with one another&#39;s 
presence. Then, Shizuru let her eyes wander a bit &#150; perhaps to look for 
that rather cute waitress once again. Instead, she found herself gazing 
out at the crowd after taking another bite of her ramen. She had always 
been somewhat of a people watcher. Why, she did not know. But it was 
that habit that would ruin her evening. Her gaze fell upon someone who 
was already staring at her.

He was young, perhaps ten, in the care of what appeared to be his 
grandmother. He merely stared. It was not in a way that indicated he was 
attracted or even interested in her. It was a hollow and empty gaze, as 
if he were afraid to move or do anything. He became lost in her returned 
stare. And it was then that Shizuru recognized his face. Not his exact 
face, but rather two separate faces that would have been the cause of 
his looks.

As sharp as her Element had been, a bardiche was not a cutting weapon. 
It was a heavy thing made for chopping. The end of it was sharp enough 
to puncture flesh, but a full on swing would simply crush whatever was 
on the receiving end. She saw the face of that boy&#39;s father, and could 
hear a sickening and watery crunch as her bardiche ripped its way 
through bone and sinew. She saw the face of that boy&#39;s mother as the 
chain form of her Element wrapped around her torso and snapped it like 
an anaconda would strangle its prey, until her lungs collapsed and her 
ribs punctured her organs.

As if possessed by that pain, Shizuru stopped breathing.

She felt what was not immediately guilt. She felt traces of that, but 
instead, she felt fear. A selfish fear that that boy would start crying, 
point to her, and turn her in to the authorities for murder. Or 
genocide. Whatever it had been. A fear that she would be taken away and 
lose all hope for her own personal redemption, and that she would be 
labeled a monster and a beast for the rest of her days and after. Time 
stopped as she and that boy stared at each other, each acknowledging 
that they indeed recognize the opposite face. The world became gray and 
silent.

Shizuru took a breath, and brought it back to life. She dropped her 
chopsticks on the table and left enough money to cover her portion of 
the bill. Natsuki stared up at her in shock as Shizuru stood. &quot;What are 
you...?&quot;

&quot;I need to leave.&quot; She offered no explanation or apologies.

&quot;What?&quot; Natsuki questioned, staring after Shizuru as she stormed away as 
fast as a walk would take her.

Upon receiving no answer, the other woman too flustered despite her 
mental control, Natsuki left her own part of the bill on the table and 
took off after her. With a bit of a jog, she caught up, staring at 
Shizuru in shock and wonder as the Kyoto woman marched down the street 
and back in the direction of her apartment, apparently intending on 
walking. That was a long walk. Natsuki grabbed onto her sleeve as they 
moved.

&quot;If you want to go home, I&#39;ll take you. Shizuru, hey, wai--&quot; Natsuki 
protested, and then nearly rammed into the other girl when she froze and 
turned back around. Her eyes betrayed the emotion she would not 
willingly show on her face. Natsuki saw fear and she saw guilt. For a 
moment, she thought she saw anger.

&quot;Go home.&quot; A demand in a tone of voice that indicated that resistance 
would do no good. A tone that indicated she was not wanted. What on 
Earth? What had caused such a reaction? She hadn&#39;t even done anything. 
Had she?

Natsuki continued to follow for a few paces. &quot;Shizuru, what did I...?&quot;

&quot;Nothing. You did nothing wrong. Just please leave me be,&quot; Shizuru 
demanded. Her body trembled as she vacated the area. Natsuki simply 
watched her go, not understanding what exactly had just happened. Ahead, 
the Kyoto woman&#39;s gut wrenched with remorse and worry that she would be 
pointed out. At that time, anything that reminded her of the Carnival 
could not be tolerated. It only worsened the images in her head. 
Natsuki, who&#39;s face had once given her hope and promises of forgiveness, 
simply served as visual proof that her nightmares had been real.

- - -

One of Shizuru&#39;s strengths was her ability to be completely apathetic to 
things that mere mortals would become hysterical over. When became 
locked in a state of emotional unrest she tended to panic, only to 
worsen it. She seldom ever wept. The only time she could recall doing 
that was right after her rebirth, when the guilt had nearly killed her 
again. She would not bring herself to cry now. To anyone looking in, 
they would have seen a calm woman sitting on her ankles in the middle of 
her apartment.

Her mind, however, was reeling so fast that she felt that passing out 
was a legitimate threat. Her brows were knitted as flashes of everything 
she did once again came back to her, as it sometimes did in the darkness 
of night before she went to sleep. She had done well to forget about it 
over the last month or so. Now, having seen the offspring of two of her 
victims, it could not be ignored.

She tried to reason with herself. She shifted blame so that she would 
not be weighed down with guilt. It was purely the Obsidian Lord toying 
with her emotions. It (or he, whatever it had been) had deliberately 
pushed her to the edge of sanity purely so that it could use her as a 
chess piece in its great game. But, she had been fine before her little 
bout of genocide, right?

It was then Nagi&#39;s fault. He had tricked her into accepting Kiyohime 
without fully explaining what it was she was doing. He had made her 
promises of grandeur and told her that a certain biker would surely be 
grateful for Shizuru defending her like some kind of knight out of a 
fairytale. A lot of good that notion did. He&#39;d acted as the messenger, 
directing her to her slaughter. But, then, they had all been subject to 
Nagi&#39;s trickery, right? They had not truly listened. She knew better as 
well. So, then...

It was Natsuki&#39;s fault. In Shizuru&#39;s desperate bid to find some kind of 
scapegoat, Natsuki became the only thing capable of being locked in her 
crosshairs. Her Key became her target.

She had given that girl everything. Her time, her family, her gifts. She 
became kaichou simply to give her access to Fuuka&#39;s database, and 
endured the endless and tedious work that followed just so that Natsuki 
could get what she wanted. She had hated it. In every case, Natsuki 
took, but had never showed Shizuru the same kind of gratitude. Whenever 
she needed help, Natsuki was nowhere to be found. Shizuru had been 
willing to die and kill for her, and Natsuki simply flinched and fled 
from her as if she was nothing more than a monster &#150; forgetting their 
precious years as each others&#39; only friend.

In that state, Shizuru could not find reason to dismiss Natsuki as the 
cause for all the actions that had unfolded, nor could she concentrate 
on anything positive. She found someone to mentally dump the burden on.

She really was such... an ungrateful child. How foolish Shizuru had been 
to find herself relying on her for comfort. She was like a homely social 
exile blindly lusting after a gorgeous elder girl &#150; no matter how kind 
she tried to be, she would always be turned away. Even on just platonic 
levels. Shizuru was a very patient, too patient, individual, and had 
trusted that the biker just needed time. Even after three years, their 
friendship had always appeared one sided. Natsuki could have at least 
found the decency to properly leave Shizuru behind if after all that 
time she still hadn&#39;t found the ability to at least pretend to be an 
honest friend.

The logical and friendlier side of Fujino Shizuru was pushed aside as 
the cowardly desire to tear herself away from her murderous guilt took 
hold.

- - -

&quot;Have you talked to her in the last few days?&quot; Natsuki inquired.

Tanya furrowed her brows. She had thought the two were in the middle of 
a tiff when they had left for Moscow, but it was still going on? Shizuru 
did not often employ the silent treatment as some sort of punishment for 
a petty argument. Their quarrel must have been serious. The red-eyed 
Russian set down her cup of tea and placed it on the table next to her 
chair. She focused on the young Japanese girl across from her on the 
couch.

&quot;I called her a time or two. She sounded fine to me,&quot; Tanya began to 
say. &quot;Did you girls get into a fight during graduation? Things have felt 
tense for the last month or so.&quot;

Natsuki grumbled in frustration. She had run to Shizuru&#39;s aunt, because, 
well, she was all Natsuki had for elder family. The biker had looked on 
the woman like her own kin, and as such, she was someone to turn to in a 
crisis &#150; even if that crisis involved her actual relative. If anyone 
knew Shizuru aside from Natsuki, it was Tanya. If she sounded fine to 
her, then was she only angry with Natsuki?

&quot;I don&#39;t know what in the hell happened,&quot; Natsuki tried to explain. &quot;One 
minute we were eating dinner downtown, and in the next, she was storming 
off and essentially telling me to get out of her sight. We were just 
eating, I... don&#39;t even recall saying anything that would have gotten 
her angry.&quot;

Natsuki paused. Had it been their light conversation about Natsuki&#39;s 
potential jealousy and the brief allusion to Shizuru&#39;s feelings that set 
her off to the point where she had some kind of anxiety attack? Damn. 
Well, she couldn&#39;t very well tell Tanya that. She looked up, seeing the 
Russian woman look mildly surprised. That was not, after all, how 
Shizuru usually behaved at all. Tanya took her time in answering, not 
entirely sure how to step into their argument. She had always kept her 
distance from their private interaction, no matter how close she was to 
them.

&quot;Has she acted like this way to your or anyone else before?&quot; Tanya 
inquired.

Natsuki slowly shook her head. She was not used to this. She was not 
used to this at all. Shizuru was the epitome of calm. Her tone of voice, 
a barking order to tell her to go away, still was fresh in her memory. 
Natsuki held up her hands in defeat. &quot;She&#39;s... never done that. What do 
I do? She won&#39;t answer her phone.&quot;

Tanya brushed a lock of Natsuki&#39;s hair back. The Japanese girl did not 
know how to handle something like this. Shizuru was introverted to a 
fault, something Tanya had always chided her about. Perhaps the anger 
that had accumulated through the years had finally made her snap in some 
way. Sending Natsuki to apologize might have been a mistake. So, Tanya 
tended to Natsuki&#39;s worries until the biker went home with a sigh, not 
knowing what else to do.

- - -

Tanya had a key to Shizuru&#39;s apartment, and she let herself in. It was 
deathly silent, which initially made Tanya tense with unfounded worry. 
Then, moving further into the apartment, she saw her niece lying on her 
couch. A half eaten omelet rested on a nearby table, the girl not having 
the stomach to finish it. Shizuru was on her belly, her face resting 
against the back of the couch, looking away.

As Tanya took a few steps closer, until she was within arm&#39;s reach, 
Shizuru stirred. She picked up on her presence, and turned a gentle 
glance back at her aunt. Eyes were watered, despite Shizuru trying her 
best to hide it. Tanya&#39;s mouth was open in worry and surprise, 
especially after Shizuru once again buried her face in the couch, 
looking away once more.

&quot;I&#39;m sleepy, Aunt Tanya. We can go out again later,&quot; Shizuru offered.

Tanya rested a hand on Shizuru&#39;s back, and that triggered the collapse 
of the last wall Shizuru still had standing. Not a second after making 
physical contact, Shizuru gave into her childlike desire of wanting a 
mother figure after all that had happened. Tanya&#39;s presence triggered a 
wave of body convulsing sobs, and the elder woman could only stare in 
shock.

Not sure what else to do, Tanya rested her head against Shizuru&#39;s arm, 
the younger girl still not turning around to face her. For ten minutes 
they remained like that, Tanya&#39;s embrace eventually calming Shizuru down 
to a point where tears no longer fell. After two further minutes of 
Shizuru recovering from her embarrassment over crying in front of 
someone, the Kyoto girl rolled onto her back, facing her aunt.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Tanya shook her head. &quot;Don&#39;t be. If you needed to let it out, you should 
not be ashamed in doing so. What happened, &#39;Ru?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t remember when it happened,&quot; Shizuru began, and only continued 
after seeing her aunt&#39;s confused face. &quot;I don&#39;t remember when I lost my 
pride and independence.&quot;

Tanya shook her head. &quot;What are you on about, Shizuru? Speak to me.&quot;

Shizuru brushed a tear out of her eye with her sweatshirt sleeve. &quot;I 
used to be happy to just wander through the world and appreciate what it 
had to offer me, you know. The Noble Truth was right after all. I had 
never listened. When I started to desire something, my life went to 
hell.&quot;

That surely meant &#39;when I started to desire someone.&#39; So it was troubles 
of the heart, then? Some youthful romance that had turned sour? Then, 
why would she snap at...? Tanya&#39;s eyes widened ever so slightly. Oh. In 
a way, it made sense. Sometimes, Tanya had wondered just how close those 
girls&#39; relationship was. &quot;How long have you been in love with her?&quot;

Shizuru did not seem entirely surprised that Tanya guessed. Had it been 
anyone else, Shizuru would have panicked in the knowledge that her 
secret was out. With Tanya, all she felt was relief. &quot;Since a few months 
after I met her and first introduced her to you.&quot;

&quot;That long?&quot; Tanya inquired, surprised. No wonder Shizuru was having an 
emotional breakdown of sorts. After years of repressing her emotions, 
she surely would have had to reach some kind of snapping point. Little 
did she know, of course, that the true snap involved unbridled 
destruction and that her niece was guilty of homicide.

Shizuru&#39;s gaze was as hard as stone. &quot;Ara, I am a fool. To be willed 
into servitude like this &#150; it is a disgrace. I do not deserve it. There 
is no reason for me to be strung along like a plaything.&quot;

Tanya took a breath. &quot;Does she know?&quot;

&quot;Yes, she knows,&quot; Shizuru said. &quot;She knows and she pities me for it. She 
told me flat out that she did not feel the same way, and I understood. 
What I could not do was break free of that spell she put on me that 
forces me to jump at her every command, or even without a command, and 
for no reward. I feel very much like that imbecile Takeda, always 
chasing but for a goal he can never reach. It is not worth it. Love is a 
state in which a man sees things most decidedly as they are not. There 
is far more to life than wasting my time with this.&quot;

&quot;So you simply want to cut her from your life?&quot; Tanya inquired, staring 
back with a similar intensity. It would have been fine if it were any 
other friend, but Natsuki? She had worked her way into the family, and 
Tanya had grown to love her. It would be heart wrenching to see a split. 
&quot;You can&#39;t force someone to love you. You&#39;ll only drive them away. You 
are the only person Natsuki truly trusts, Shizuru. You can&#39;t just leave 
her. Even if she doesn&#39;t feel the same, she still does love you.&quot;

Shizuru&#39;s jaw tightened. &quot;I can&#39;t just turn off emotions, no matter what 
people think. I can&#39;t continue to be in her presence while thinking such 
unnatural things. I&#39;ll just end up back in the same pattern of 
self-abuse.&quot;

Tanya began to glare. &quot;Your mother said something to me once that I 
never forgot, and I&#39;m going to do a shitty paraphrasing of it, but it 
rings true. Romance is only one form of love, and it isn&#39;t even the 
strongest one. Romance is love tainted with carnal desire. Real, honest 
love is affection on its own &#150; when two people care for each other 
without worrying or focusing on what the other looks like sans their 
clothing. When you find honest love, then and only then does the romance 
aspect have a proper place in a relationship. You can find more 
fulfillment from a friend than a lover. You think you&#39;re a fool now. If 
you throw away the genuine friendship you and Natsuki have, something 
that had already bordered on that kind of honest love, then you will 
become the moron you describe.&quot;

The Kyoto girl sat up with a uncharacteristically harsh sigh, still 
suppressing all of the still very present guilt she felt over her mild 
killing spree and all the other, far worse, things she had done. &quot;It&#39;s 
going to be impossible to look at her the same ever again. I can&#39;t do 
it.&quot;

&quot;Yes, you can. But if you don&#39;t want to try, I can&#39;t make you,&quot; Tanya 
said. &quot;It is your life and she is your friend &#150; your only friend, I 
might point out &#150; and so it is your decision to make.&quot;

Shizuru gave a shaky sigh, still lost in thought. She was Takeda. She 
was more desperate than Takeda. Only someone who greatly lacked powers 
of retention would continue such a vain pursuit. To be dependent on 
someone was folly, and she never used to be like that. She had been 
strong, and she tried to remember the last time she had a spine. For 
Shizuru, in both her upbringing and her personal belief, strength and 
independence was something to be cherished. Tanya did speak a few words 
of truth, she would give her that. She formed a quick plan in her head 
of what she could possibly do to free herself from that kind of 
captivity without losing the friendship that had kept her content over 
the years and had pulled Shizuru out of a state of loneliness that only 
the likes of Nao or Natsuki could understand.

Shizuru was stubborn, perhaps as much as Natsuki, and if she could get 
it through her head that she was free from whatever spell had been put 
on her those years ago, then she could find a way through it. Natsuki 
was not important. She took a deep breath, the murkiest depths of her 
consciousness still hissing that the mayhem and chaos of the Carnival 
was all the biker&#39;s fault.

She would recover her grace and dignity once again. It would just take 
time and a gentle shove.

Author Notes:
To be honest, I get quite sick of reading stories with Shizuru simply 
following Natsuki around like a lost dog incapable of surviving without 
her, or having her entire life essentially revolve around nothing else 
but trying to win Natsuki over. So, for anyone who wants kaichou-sama to 
have a backbone, this will probably be your story. </pre>
