<p>The soft padding of socks on wooden floors echoed from room to room  as Shizuru went in search of the recently-fled Natsuki. Beneath the  unruffled demeanor that she reserved for the rest of the world, her  thoughts were in turmoil. She and Natsuki had known each other for a  relatively long time when one considered the fickle nature of an  adolescent girl. Their relationship had survived many things, even  unexpected betrayal, but Shizuru feared that she had tested their bond  one time too many. No one knew better than she just how fragile  Natsuki’s ego was beneath her bad-girl exterior. A wry smile slid  across the pretty teen’s face as one hilarious memory came to mind.</p>
<p>Wandering  in and out of the maze of hallways and stairs, her path might have been  misconstrued as being directionless, but the brunette had gone through  this scenario many times before. The end result was always the same.</p>
<p>Shizuru stood before the wood-paneled <em>shoji</em> that led out into a scaled down <em>Saiho-ji</em> replica garden that was almost completely invisible to the main campus,  safely tucked into the dormitory building’s west-facing corner, and  contemplated her next move. Only a handful of students knew of this  place; in truth, Shizuru made certain that number was kept to a minimum  for this was her private place, a gift from Kazahana Mashiro after  successful negotiation proceedings with a particularly troublesome  Fuuka businessman the previous year. After Shizuru shared the garden  with Natsuki when it was completed, it became the biker girl’s  favourite place of refuge. Whenever Natsuki was upset or felt the need  to be alone, she could be found in wandering along the garden’s  bamboo-laced path that led to the burbling brook at its center.</p>
<p>She  hadn’t expected Natsuki to react as vehemently as she did. The damage  was done, however, and her mind worked furiously to figure out a way to  make amends. After a few moments’ reflection, she knocked quietly.</p>
<p>“Whoever it is, you’d better leave now if you know what’s good for you.”</p>
<p>“My, such a threatening tone, Natsuki,” admonished Shizuru.</p>
<p>The  door opened slowly to allow her admittance to the garden. She took that  as a good sign and stepped outside to sit beside her brooding  girlfriend. They sat in silence for a long while, watching afternoon  pass into twilight.</p>
<p>“Shizuru, do you trust me?” Natsuki’s muted  query shattered the evening stillness. Shizuru cocked an eyebrow,  clearly surprised by the question.</p>
<p>“Of course I do,” she replied with a hint of concern in her voice. “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>Natsuki  shrugged and stood up, absently brushing pollen dust off the backside  of her skirt. “I get the feeling that you don’t really.”</p>
<p>A puzzled frown turned down the corners of the young <em>kaichou</em>’s mouth; it was an expression that she seldom wore. “I do not understand, Natsuki. Why do you not believe that I trust you?”</p>
<p>“Because  you still treat me like a child,” came Natsuki’s terse response. “You  say that you trust in me yet your words do not coincide with your  actions.” She turned to face Shizuru, her green eyes flashing in the  near-darkness. “I want you to trust me to be an adult, to be mature  enough to be in this relationship <em>as an equal</em>. I understand  that you’re only joking more often than not but sometimes you go too  far.” Her hands clenched and unclenched while she spoke, signaling that  she was clearly more upset than she was letting on.</p>
<p>“I-“ Shizuru  paused as her mind pondered furiously about what to say next or even  how to say it. “Have I really hurt you that much?”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Natsuki blurted. “Well, no…yes and no. You know what I mean!” she growled in frustration.</p>
<p>“I see.” Shizuru tried to keep an amused smile from bubbling to the surface without much success.</p>
<p>“I’m <em>serious!</em>” Natsuki raged.</p>
<p>“I know you are. I can’t help it if “serious Natsuki” is so attractive.”</p>
<p>The younger girl let out an agitated scream and was about to stalk off into the garden when a gentle hand caught her sleeve.</p>
<p>“Your  point is well taken. Come sit.” She pulled Natsuki back to her side and  waited for her to get settled before continuing. “I must admit, there  are times when I forget how much you’ve matured. And, it’s true, I push  your buttons simply because you make it so easy for me. <em>However</em>,” her voice rose to cut off Natsuki’s impending outburst, “I do understand where you are coming from and I apologise.”</p>
<p>Natsuki blinked owlishly in surprise. “What was that?”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“Did you just admit to being wrong about something?”</p>
<p>Shizuru faux-pondered the question for a moment. “Why, you know, I think I might have.”</p>
<p>“Smartass.”</p>
<p>“You  asked a silly question, naturally, the answer would be just as silly.”  Shizuru pulled the younger girl into a gentle embrace and spoke softly  into her ear. “Am I forgiven?”</p>
<p>A deep flush rose from Natsuki’s  face from the warmth of Shizuru’s breath on her sensitive skin.  “M-maybe. Whooo…but there’s something that you need to know.”</p>
<p>Shizuru raised an inquiring eyebrow at suggestion. “I’m listening.”</p>
<p>From a hiding place within the folds of her skirt, Natsuki sheepishly produced two cards from the winning game.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” Shizuru queried with an arch smile.</p>
<p>“Erm, I <em>may</em> have tried to even the odds a little.”</p>
<p>“May? I would say that you managed to succeed.”</p>
<p>“It’s  all Midori’s fault! If she hadn’t said this was strip poker I wouldn’t  have had much of an incenti—oh, I’m digging myself into a hole, aren’t  I?” Natsuki caught herself in mid-rant as she noticed Shizuru’s crossed  arms on her chest.</p>
<p>“I’d say that you have a bit of making up to do this evening,” Shizuru purred.</p>
<p>Natsuki  shrugged as she realized she’d have to pay the piper for this one.  Truth be told, she really didn’t mind all that much. She stood up and  held her hand out to her lover in a cavalierly fashion. “Why don’t we  take care of that right now?”</p>
<p>As Shizuru put her hand in  Natsuki's, she allowed herself a private little smile. If anyone had  asked her if she knew all along that Natsuki had been cheating just a  bit, she’d have denied it to the end. “Indeed, let’s.”</p>
