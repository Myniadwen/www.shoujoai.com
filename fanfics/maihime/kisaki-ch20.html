<h1>Mai Kisaki (part 20 of 22)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/asinistre.html">Ange Sinistre</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/kisaki-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>Stardust

A sense of shame made its full impact when Akira and Akane, after seeing 
the Children flee from Dammerung, returned to the HiME base. Mai watched 
as their faces contorted with grief as they were told what had happened. 
Shiho now stared back at them with lifeless eyes as she sat before the 
statue of Yatagarasu within the Altar of the Ikusahime. Flowers rested 
below the statues of Julia and Gakutenou, the fallen mistresses spared 
the pain of a lifeless, post-Separation existence. Akira turned her head 
to the side to hide her sorrow while Akane wept openly. And through it 
all, Mai began to hate herself.

She was the strongest, was she not? She was the legend amongst the 
legends. She had won the Carnival and triumphed against the odds. The 
modern HiME sung songs about her deeds, however exaggerated they were. 
She must have looked pathetic now. In her time on Earth, she had not 
been able to save one comrade from defeat. She was too hesitant, too 
late, too slow. Why did it always take her so long to find her primal 
sense of aggression? She had the greatest power, but she was so hesitant 
to use it. She sickened herself. Had she just been a little less 
peaceful, she might have been able to do something.

Mai watched silently as Mashiro, who had been nothing more than a na&iuml;ve 
queen a few days ago, took charge of everything. It was in her nature to 
do so. As Kazahana she manipulated, and as Windbloom she commanded. She 
was comfortable in that role. Mashiro had no trouble facing the prospect 
of killing a friend for the sake of ultimate peace. Mai was both 
discouraged by and envious of that.

&quot;The Star might be in proper range by this evening,&quot; the Queen of Hell 
stated, hands on her hips like a true monarch. &quot;If that is the case, 
then we will destroy it. There should be just enough of us left. It is 
likely that the Obsidian Lord will send Otome after us. I know you may 
love many of them, but you can&#39;t let your attachments get the better of 
you. It is far too late to be a victim of your emotions.&quot;

Mashiro stared at her for a moment, and Mai turned her gaze to the 
floor. She could sense the other woman&#39;s disapproval.

&quot;At this point, you must hold nothing back. We must end what man has 
tried to recreate. Never forget that there is no demon in the shadows 
waiting to take your soul. Your enemy is a machine &#150; a computer program 
gone rogue. It does not deserve your mercy. If you simply render Natsuki 
unconscious we should be able to get to the Obsidian Lord without the 
host body interfering.&quot;

&quot;And Alyssa-chan? Shizuru?&quot; Akane tentatively asked.

&quot;Alyssa Searrs should not be alive. Do not complicate things. You can 
and you will destroy the Emulator. We attack Dammerung immediately after 
the Star is gone to prevent the Lord from using any more tricks. If 
Shizuru stands in your way, then stun or kill her. Losing Natsuki and 
Shizuru is nothing compared to the extinction of life on Earth. Keep 
your priorities straight. Remember that you are living proof that life 
continues after death. We&#39;ll all get another chance, but only if we 
ensure the survival of the whole.&quot;

Akira nodded. &quot;I understand.&quot;

&quot;Is Ann going to be able to use Yafusa in time? We&#39;ll need those plastic 
cartridges or whatever they are in order to blow up the Star.&quot; Akane was 
clearly uncomfortable with Mashiro&#39;s ideology, but was willing to try 
anything during the final act. Options were limited.

&quot;I will work with Ann. I&#39;m familiar with all the HiME abilities, so I 
will teach her the basics of Yafusa&#39;s power. So long as she can get him 
to fire shots from his remaining cannon, we should be fine. Her body 
needed time to recovery from the HiME transfusion, but she is up and 
moving in the infirmary.&quot; Mashiro waited for further questions, but none 
came. Assuming they were done, she finished things. &quot;Go get some rest 
and prepare for the battles at hand. You&#39;ll need all the energy you can 
get.&quot;

Mikoto plopped herself down on the floor and looked up at Mai with a 
grin, despite all the ongoings. &quot;Mai, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re still safe! I&#39;m 
sorry that I wasn&#39;t able to stay closer, but Nao-san had plans.&quot;

&quot;Yes, she certainly did.&quot;

The monotone voice cause Mikoto&#39;s expression to change. Mai was 
depressed. &quot;What is the matter, Mai? Are you scared?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Mai turned to look at her long time friend and put a false smile 
onto her face in order to put Mikoto at ease. &quot;No, Mikoto, I&#39;m not 
scared. Please don&#39;t worry yourself.&quot;

Mikoto didn&#39;t appear to be all that satisfied. &quot;Mai definitely does not 
look fine.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m not exactly the most chipper thing right now, given how 
everyone&#39;s killing each other and the world is ending!&quot; Mai excused with 
a gentle laugh. She patted Mikoto on the head. &quot;Now, really, just focus 
on what we have to do and stop worrying so much!&quot;

Deciding that she was not going to make any progress, Mikoto rested her 
chin against her hand and watched as Mashiro left the Altar. When the 
new &#39;leader&#39; vanished, Akane and Akira came to Mai, apparently too 
hesitant to speak freely with Mashiro there. Akane appeared naturally 
distressed, and though Akira tried to maintain a poker face, she too was 
uncomfortable. Mai decided that if she wanted to be just as useful as 
her counterpart, now was the best time to start. She had to be their 
support in this time of crisis.

&quot;It&#39;s so insane. This all happened so fast. We went from post-war 
peacetime to the end of the world in about ten seconds flat,&quot; Akane 
lamented. &quot;I barely remember the Carnival, but I can&#39;t believe Searrs or 
Schwarz, or whoever, just copied the Obsidian Lord in its entirety. What 
idiots.&quot;

&quot;But you know,&quot; Mai said, &quot;this is probably the only real chance to put 
an end to Searrs&#39; legacy. We couldn&#39;t do much last time because we had 
to keep our identities a secret from the rest of humanity and we had no 
real way of tracking a fully operational Searrs. Now everyone knows what 
we are, and we can just wipe out whatever Searrs technology is left.&quot;

&quot;Starting with that thing in the sky that turns moons into giant 
Pokeballs,&quot; Akira said dryly. &quot;Are we all agreed that we&#39;ll do whatever 
it takes to win? Even if Shizuru or Natsuki have to die?&quot;

Akane squirmed a bit at the thought. &quot;If we absolutely have to... but 
poor Alyssa.&quot;

Mai smiled. &quot;Mashiro&#39;s right, you know. There&#39;s always another lifetime 
waiting for us all. Hopefully free of renegade computers and monsters.&quot;

It was, without question, the hangover from hell. Ann was going to swear 
off alcohol if she made it out alive. HiME genetic modifications left a 
bad aftertaste. Her muscles felt stronger and her stamina increased 
tenfold, but she felt downright sick. Her head hurt. Her lower back 
burned. Her extremities felt like they were covered in a layer of ice. 
It was only in the last hour that she stopped being lightheaded and 
nauseous. She would have loved to suffer in private, as she did with 
regular hangovers, but the young queen of Windbloom had started to 
channel the spirit of a drill sergeant. Ann was forced to workwith all 
those impairments.

&quot;It is vital that you learn how to master the basics before we head into 
battle,&quot; Mashiro repeated. Her voice was soft but quite stern at the 
same time. Like a nagging mother.

Azumi, though irritated at her loss of power, had come in to help Ann 
adjust. &quot;You concentrate your photon generating power just below your 
open palms. A pair of pistols will form just below your hands.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s like summoning your Otome Element. Just focus on a pair of small 
ice pistols. The same ones that Azumi used,&quot; Mashiro added.

Guns. Why guns? Ann was familiar with guns, but they were not her 
specialty. That was Natsuki&#39;s forte. Yet, if her rambunctious kohai 
could switch from flail to falcata sword after the Topaz was disabled, 
then she could certainly put forth the same effort. She had to in order 
to honor Haruka&#39;s fighting spirit. It wouldn&#39;t have been proper, 
otherwise. She held out her hands and tried to focus on those stupid 
little guns that Azumi had used with wonderful precision. A dim glow 
generated in her palms as photons gathered. The HiME brand on her back 
began to burn with increased fervor.

Gritting her teeth as she focused, Ann snapped her eyes open as the 
tension left her completely. She turned her gaze to her hands and saw 
two pistols hovering in mid air. She grabbed them before they could fall 
to the floor, and felt her body return to a relatively stable condition. 
Holding up both guns, she examined them with a scientific eye. Small and 
with no apparent method of reloading them. Ammunition was generated from 
her power, then? She heard that firearm Elements used by other Otome 
worked in a similar fashion.

&quot;Try to hit that bottle of rubbing alcohol on the table over there. Get 
used to the way they work,&quot; Azumi suggested, pointing to a small 
container of the aforementioned liquid.

She had only ever fired a single gun at a time before. It was tempting 
to use her left hand to steady her regular gun arm, but that was now 
impossible. Instead, she tried to keep her arm as level as possible on 
its own. Aiming the right side gun at the bottle, she squeezed the 
trigger. With light contact, an ice shard fired from the barrel of the 
gun and slammed into the wall just beside the bottle. Ann frowned. 
Stupid things, they were faulty!

Azumi frowned. &quot;You&#39;re not even ten feet away.&quot;

Ann fought the urge to tell her to do awful things to herself. Instead, 
she tried it again. This time, the ice shard penetrated the bottle 
itself, shattering the glass. Ann switched arms and aimed with the left, 
lining up the gun with a surgical tool resting on the other end of the 
table. She fired and smiled in satisfaction as both Mashiro and Azumi 
ducked for cover as the tool flew through the air after being flung off 
the table by a troublesome ice bullet.

&quot;Okay, enough!&quot; Azumi yelled. &quot;Dematerialize those things for a minute.&quot;

Ann did so, but with minor disappointment. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, dear, I would 
never think of deforming that pretty face of yours. I wouldn&#39;t be able 
to live with myself.&quot;

&quot;Try to punch me, Otome.&quot;

&quot;Punch you? I have no objections with doing things rough, but shouldn&#39;t 
we start slow? Perhaps put on some nice music and light a few candles?&quot; 
Ann said, mildly surprised at the request.

&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll attack you. Block it.&quot;

She wasn&#39;t kidding. Azumi, now with standard human reflexes after losing 
her power, threw a punch aimed towards Ann&#39;s stomach. Fearing that 
nausea would return if she were hit, Ann moved to defend herself. 
Everything felt different. She was faster. The incoming punch seemed 
slower than it normally would have. All her sense and reflexes were 
heightened. Ann grabbed the incoming arm and deflected it with 
surprising ease. She slammed her palm into Azumi&#39;s side and watched as 
she was pushed back several feet, Ann&#39;s strength now far superior. It 
felt like she was wearing a robe.

&quot;Your body has become enhanced. It&#39;s not quite at the same level of a 
Meister Otome. Perhaps a Coral or Pearl,&quot; Mashiro said. &quot;But it&#39;s 
permanent, whether or not you have a power source. If the Emulator goes 
down, you should easily defeat an unarmed Otome.&quot;

Well, it was a start. She was beginning to feel comfortable with it all, 
foreign though it felt. With further practice, she would be able to at 
least do something. If she was unable to successfully fight with the 
guns, a likely situation, she could always fall back on her martial arts 
skills. She had good marks at Garderobe for her various hand-to-hand 
fighting classes, and had used them extensively during her Otome career. 
Mashiro and Azumi both seemed pleased at her progress.

Azumi began to move on. &quot;The second phase of your basic training is...&quot;

Without warning, all the lights within the subterranean HiME base went 
out. Crashes and multiple swear words could be heard outside the 
infirmary. Everything was pitch black. Azumi expected the backup 
generator to kick on, but it did not. Was this an EMP attack sent by the 
Otome? But she hadn&#39;t even heard an explosion of any kind. She sighed in 
frustration, grabbing hold of the table in order to keep her bearings in 
the dark.

&quot;...to navigate in the dark. Great.&quot;

Mashiro could be heard summoning her Element, and a moment later, the 
room was dimly lit by Maitreya&#39;s blue energy lines that ran along the 
blade. It didn&#39;t provide much illumination, no further than a foot or 
two, but it was better than nothing. It was something to follow. Another 
glow outside of the infirmary indicated that Mai was doing the same 
thing. One of her Spirals was lit up like a torch, giving the main room 
a source of light as she entered to see what was going on.

&quot;Well, that t-took me longer than expected, but I fi-finally did i-it.&quot;

The distorted voice the came over the base&#39;s loudspeakers was clearly, 
without question, an electronically altered version of Natsuki&#39;s. Ann&#39;s 
group was frozen in place for a moment before Mashiro let out an angry 
sigh. Ann could see the faint red lights of the base&#39;s security cameras 
focus on one precise location &#150; right where she and Mashiro were. Were 
they Natsuki&#39;s eyes in the dark?

&quot;Your security was quite impressive, but I&#39;m afraid t-t-that it was 
still no m-a-atch for me. We machines know each other, you see. Part 
o-of the same worker&#39;s union.&quot;

Somebody, it sounded like Minako, shouted out in the dark. &quot;Get the 
backup generator online this instant! All security officers get our 
computers back!&quot;

The various displays and computer terminals came to life, their default 
screens replaced with a red Searrs emblem. The illumination from the 
displays lit the main room just enough to where people could see without 
having to rely on Mai&#39;s Element. Apparently, the OL did not approve of 
Minako&#39;s instructions. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that if I were you.&quot;

One of the defense turrets sprang to life and fired a shot. The bullet 
penetrated Minako&#39;s stomach and burst out the other side before slamming 
into the floor. The grand leader of the HiME fell into a pool of her own 
gathering blood and several grunts ran to her side. Mai, hoping to 
prevent the machine from doing any more damage, instantly reacted by 
flying up and hurling a stream of fire at it. The room was bathed in a 
warm glow as the machine burst into flames. Mai searched the room for 
any more of the devices, usually meant to keep out invading Otome.

&quot;A-a-as you can see, I am now everything here. Your whole base n-now 
belongs to me. I s-see everything and control e-everything.&quot; The OL 
paused as if considering something. The voice dipped to Reito&#39;s before 
turning back into Natsuki. &quot;In my absence, the HiME gene pool has been 
a-allowed to run rampant. I&#39;m afraid I must... correct that.&quot;

&quot;Azumi, how many of those gun turrets are littered around the base?&quot; 
Mashiro quickly asked in a hushed voice.

A defeated sigh. &quot;...Lots.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the best way out of here?&quot; Ann inquired.

&quot;We&#39;ll never make it out the main entrance. It&#39;s littered with them to 
act as primary defense against Otome. There are service tunnels beneath 
that. We could try those.&quot;

&quot;Everybody get out of here!&quot; Mashiro shouted at the top of her lungs as 
gunshots echoed throughout the base. Screams could be heard in the 
distance. &quot;Evacuate the building immediately! Use the service tunnels! 
Members of the Twelve, go get the defeated HiME from the Altar!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see why anyone listens to her.&quot; The voice now fell into Nagi&#39;s 
voice pattern as Mai and the others ran across the main hall to reach 
Mashiro. &quot;S-she&#39;s mean. She&#39;s a bad person. She doesn&#39;t even care about 
any of you. She doesn&#39;t care about anything. All she cares about is 
be-eing better than everyone else.&quot;

The remaining Ikusahime gathered together as &#39;Nagi&#39; continued to rant 
and rave. Azumi took the lead, as she was most familiar with the base, 
and she led them to a southeast passage that branched off from the main 
hall. People were crowding the area in a desperate attempt to escape. 
Those who had illogically fled out the main entrance fell victim to the 
automated gun turrets that were strategically positioned along the path. 
Dull booms from guns and cannons could be heard even as the evacuees 
jumped into the service tunnels below the main entrance. It became a 
chore to run as a group. People shoved their way between them and 
divided the Ikusahime. Mikoto, shortest of the lot, disappeared under a 
wave of frantic HiME personnel. Mai used what space was available to 
float in the air and look for her companion as the whole crowd headed 
down the tunnel.

&quot;She betrayed and killed all her friends just so she could win the 
Carnival. You can&#39;t trust her. Broke a young man&#39;s heart for the sake of 
victory. S-she thinks you&#39;re nothing but pieces on a chessboard. So long 
as you do what she wants, she won&#39;t care if you drop d-d-dead when it&#39;s 
over.&quot;

The emergency lights in the service tunnel blinked out of existence at 
the Obsidian Lord&#39;s digital command, and everyone was left in absolute 
darkness. Knowing that the crowd would need her guidance, and knowing 
that she could not find Mikoto in that situation, Mai shot ahead of 
everyone and lit her Elements. She became the beacon in the darkness, 
leading everyone along the path to what was hopefully freedom. Mai 
squinted her eyes to try and make out anything ahead of her, but found 
that it was too difficult.

&quot;You want her as a leader? She murdered f-f-five of her closest friends. 
Burned them alive. Watched them w-writhe on the ground in pain as the 
life drained out of them. She&#39;s just an evil woman. Stop listening to 
her and just get on with the Carnival. A-a-at least I don&#39;t lie about my 
intentions. She&#39;s probably just going to lead you into a death trap so 
that she can win for a second time.&quot;

The doors at the end of the service tunnel slammed shut as Mai 
approached them, the locking mechanism going into effect. She dropped to 
the ground and tried to disengage it, but it was no use. Instead, she 
shot herself back several feet and charge a powerful shot with her 
Elements. Releasing the wave of fire, it slammed right into the metal 
security doors and burrowed into them. Mai gritted her teeth as she held 
the flame stream in place. When she finally lost most of her energy, she 
cut off the flow and stared at her handiwork. There was a massive hold 
in the door, the metal melted down and blasted out. The edges were still 
red hot. She could still feel the heat on her body.

Back to Natsuki&#39;s voice, growing more infuriated. &quot;It&#39;s not like any of 
you will be safe outside. I can infect any electronic system in Kyoto. 
My eyes will be everywhere and you will have nowhere to run. Because 
she&#39;s waiting for you. And I&#39;ll tell her exactly where to go to collect 
your heads. Do you apes hear me?!&quot;

Mai was the first to clear the security door and make it outside, 
leaving behind putrid smoke for crisp, fresh air. The service tunnel let 
out just below the main entrance, and the few gun turrets on the 
outermost edge of the main tunnel pivoted around to face her. It was 
only when Mashiro left that they seemed to properly activate. Mai dashed 
forward before they could fire and released a burst of fire to destroy 
them. Only one went up in flames, as she could no longer use her full 
power thanks to the feat she had just performed. Mashiro hurled the 
Maitreya blade like a large boomerang and watched as it flew through the 
air, slicing the other turret in two. She recalled it immediately, and 
it returned to her pale fist.

The stood off to the side as the other Ikusahime left the service 
tunnel, each of them drifting to the side in order to regroup. The other 
evacuees fled into the forests surrounding the base, seeking cover in 
nature &#150; a place that should have been the only area where a renegade 
computer could not reach them.

They all paused when they heard a deep rumble from within the base. 
Turning to look at their former home, their jaws dropped as the central 
complex exploded. The force nearly threw them to the ground, and debris 
soon began to rain from the sky. Everyone covered their heads and 
cleared away from the area, all Diadem devices powering down. Azumi 
instantly knew what had happened. The Obsidian Lord had surely 
overloaded the HiME Emulator and destroyed it! That was the only 
explanation for the sudden loss of Diadem power.

A solitary voice, growing ever more distorted in the wake of the 
explosion, was all that remained. &quot;I&#39;ll kill you, Kazahana! Their 
Emulator is gone! I w-o-on&#39;t let any of them inte-r-feeere! Y-you&#39;re all 
mine now!&quot;

- - -

&quot;Onee-sama!&quot;

Shizuru accepted Tomoe&#39;s gracious hand as she stepped off one of 
Kiyohime&#39;s heads. The younger woman had remained exactly where Shizuru 
had told her to stay before the battle on Mount Hiei. Shizuru was 
pleased to see that Tomoe looked much more energetic and far healthier 
now. She had desperately needed time to rest, and it seemed to do 
wonders for her. Shizuru&#39;s own sore muscles were now complaining of the 
same issues, but she somehow doubted that she would ever get a chance to 
properly rest. Battling Yatagarasu, fighting Midori and Gakutenou, and 
then finally trying to evade Mai in the mountains. It had all taken a 
terrible toll on her body.

Hoping to at least catch her breath, Shizuru daintily sat down on an old 
stone planter than had long since been devoid of any life. Tomoe quickly 
knelt down and grabbed hold of her canteen, then offered it to the other 
woman. Shizuru accepted it with a faint smile. &quot;Thank you, Tomoe.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re not hurt, onee-sama,&quot; Tomoe said as the veteran warrior 
took several gulps of water. &quot;Were you successful?&quot;

Shizuru brought the canteen away from her mouth for a moment, eyes 
unfocused, lost in thought. It took her a moment to respond. &quot;Yes, I 
was.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot;

Shizuru turned her eyes to Tomoe&#39;s smiling face and found her own lips 
locked in a frown. Of course she was glad, Shizuru thought to herself. 
She was tenacious and willing to defeat anyone who stood in her way. She 
never cared who she trampled on in her quest for power and glory. 
Whatever tenderness Tomoe had was often covered up by her arrogance and 
combative nature. Shizuru hated looking at her sometimes. At fifteen, 
she had been the same exact kind of heartless bitch. To be reminded of 
that was too much. It not only caused her heartache, but it allowed her 
to slip back into the same attitude.

Shizuru shoved the canteen into Tomoe&#39;s hand without any of her 
trademark grace. &quot;For someone who is so concerned with my well being, 
you would do well to be a little more observant.&quot;

Tomoe was taken aback. &quot;Pardon?&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t you see that every time I defeat one of them, a vital part of me 
is lost? For a moment, I was even taking sick pleasure in the battles! 
My success and their defeat is not something to be praised,&quot; Shizuru 
snapped, staring up at the other woman with fierce red eyes.

Tomoe looked offended, but managed to control herself. Her words were 
delivered with forced calm. &quot;I would rather you not die, onee-sama, so I 
will continue to praise your success, regardless of what you have 
against that.&quot;

Shizuru sighed and turned her gaze to the clouds above, deliberately 
avoiding eye contact. Why couldn&#39;t this girl simply get it through her 
head? &quot;Tomoe, I have tried to explain this several times. As much as I 
appreciate your assistance, I&#39;m well aware that you&#39;re only doing it so 
that you might somehow win my heart. This will never happen, as it 
belongs to another. Things are becoming far too tense right now. As this 
is not your fight, you should simply find some kind of shelter and wait 
things out. You can return to Earl after all is said and done, 
regardless of who wins in the end.&quot;

The green haired woman was silent for a breath or two as she continued 
to fight for emotional control. She spoke coolly, but anger was present 
behind her words. &quot;I don&#39;t understand why you care for her so much. 
Natsuki never shows any indication that she even likes you, much less 
loves you. She only ever looks at you like you&#39;re one of her many 
soldiers. She never showers you with any kind of affections. She never 
does anything for you. She&#39;s a cold and emotionless bitch!&quot;

Saying something like that to Shizuru had always been, and would 
continue to be, a near death sentence. Tomoe was spared any form of 
physical pain because Shizuru hoped that Tomoe could somehow learn to 
become a proper human being. She was starting to feel as if that was a 
wasted wish. &quot;Just because she does not shove her tongue into my mouth 
in public doesn&#39;t mean that she lacks affection in private. Natsuki has 
a bigger heart than most people ever will. Now stop being so stubborn 
and follow my suggestion. This is not your fight. Get out of here.&quot;

Tomoe bent down and snatched up her glaive, her face locked in a snarl. 
&quot;Fine. If you are so stupid to refuse my help when the odds are against 
you, then that&#39;s your business. An Otome came by ten minutes ago with a 
message from your overlord. She wants you back at Dammerung.&quot;

There were tears in Tomoe&#39;s eyes as she marched away, her body language 
furious. Shizuru felt guilty for a fleeting second, but remembered that 
sometimes you had to be cruel in order to be kind. Now on her own once 
more, Shizuru turned her gaze to the old Imperial palace and reluctantly 
stood. Her legs ached as she strode back over to Kiyohime and climbed 
back onto the hydra, her purple kimono tattered and loosely hanging over 
her combat suit beneath it. As Kiyohime took her back to the heart of 
Kyoto, she could not help but mourn the fabric&#39;s poor condition even 
with the tragedy that had taken place that day. What a waste.

Harry materialized in the woods southwest of the hijacked base. When he 
was complete, he gave his mistress a gentle growl. Akane waved her arms 
in the direction of the Child like a pretty girl on a game show trying 
to show off the grand prize. &quot;Ta da!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s as easy as that,&quot; Azumi said.

&quot;A metal tiger formed out of thin air. That&#39;s supposed to be &#39;easy?&#39;&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s the same process as summoning your Element, just put on a slightly 
larger scale. Use the same method to call Yafusa forth,&quot; Mashiro 
instructed. She seemed thoughtful for the moment. &quot;You were forcefully 
introduced to him, however. Most HiME are bonded with their Child before 
the first summoning via an acceptance ritual. He may not initially be 
fond of you.&quot;

Azumi snorted in amusement. &quot;Yafusa is not fond of anyone. He&#39;s a cranky 
old son of a bitch thanks to his injuries.&quot;

Ann held her hand up and began to concentrate on summoning the beast, 
but stopped herself before it could be done after a thought crossed her 
mind. &quot;If he was Natsuki&#39;s old Child, will he obey me if I ask him to 
attack either her or her subordinates?&quot;

&quot;She got into a fight with me when you all first arrived. Yafusa was 
hesitant at first, but was then more than willing to attack her. She 
shot him in the face, you see,&quot; Azumi recounted. &quot;He&#39;s an aggressive 
brute, so that should be no problem. Now stop stalling and get to work.&quot;

Ann suppressed a small laugh at Azumi&#39;s bossiness. What a dominatrix she 
must have been! She quickly pushed those thoughts out of her mind before 
she completely lost herself in vulgar fantasy. There were more pressing 
matters at hand. She held her hand out and pictured both Natsuki and the 
wolf that was supposed to be Yafusa. She saw a vague outline form in 
front of her, just beside Harry. More focus made the translucent figure 
take a more solid shape. A lame back leg. An empty cannon slot. The wolf 
became more defined. Soon, the full robotic beast stood before her in 
all his wretched glory.

He stood slightly lower than shoulder height, but somehow made it seem 
like he was looking down on Ann. Yafusa glared at her with his digital 
eyes and took a whiff of her scent, muzzle resting close to her face. He 
growled, but did not move to attack, which was probably all that could 
be hoped for. She tried not to feel any kind of fear, but couldn&#39;t help 
but find herself nervous in his presence. That sense of nervousness 
faded as Yafusa, like his fleshy counterpart, turned to Harry, the 
feline Child. After a low bark, the two began to run off, Yafusa chasing 
behind the tiger.

&quot;Hey! Hey, hey! Stop that!&quot; Akane yelled, becoming the third member of 
their train as she sprinted after the both of them.

Azumi began to chase after them as well. &quot;Yafusa! No! Sit, sit! Bad 
dog!&quot;

Twenty minutes and one bruised knee (Akane) later, both Children were 
back under control. That catastrophe over, Azumi continued the lesson by 
going over all of Yafusa&#39;s abilities. Training session were had and with 
an imitation cry of &quot;load silver cartridge,&quot; several trees were 
sacrificed for the sake of Child education. While it was clear that 
Yafusa no longer desired to be a slave of anyone, he seemed willing to 
work with the newly initiated Ann. Perhaps it was the lingering scent of 
Shizuru that made him docile.

It was when Ann&#39;s training took her into a clearing that she was allowed 
to experience another of her &#39;abilities.&#39; Her eyes drifted skyward and 
there she saw the HiME Star for the first time. It had nearly frightened 
her to see something so foreign in the sky. Larger than the moon and jet 
black with a ribbon of crimson, it made for a startling sight. So, 
Natsuki hadn&#39;t been kidding about the strange star in the sky! She would 
have apologized someday had Natsuki not reordered her genetic code.

When she heard rustling coming from the far side of the clearing, she 
summoned an Element and leveled it at the noise&#39;s origin. With her 
finger on the trigger, Ann watched as the figure emerged from the other 
side of the woods. Glad that she was not one to fire prematurely, she 
moved the gun to the side after seeing that it was Arika Yumemiya 
dressed in her basic uniform. Even if she wanted to start a fight for 
the same of Dammerung and Natsuki, she would not stand a chance without 
an operational GEM.

&quot;Ann!&quot; Arika greeted, a grin spreading over her face. It was quickly 
replaced with worry. &quot;Have you seen Mashiro? It&#39;s very important! She 
broke off her contract!&quot;

Not quite sure whether or not Arika was still loyal to the Otome, Ann 
tried to gain a new ally by revealing Natsuki&#39;s treachery. &quot;She&#39;s safe. 
I escorted her out of the city when Natsuki sent the Earth Columns to 
assassinate her.&quot;

&quot;Natsuki did what?!&quot; Arika gasped. She jumped in place a few times. 
&quot;Well, then you definitely have to tell me where she is! She&#39;s going to 
need my protection!&quot;

&quot;But you don&#39;t have your G--&quot;

&quot;Arika?&quot;

Both turned to see Mashiro appear from the woods, joining them in the 
clearing. For however cold she had become thanks to Kazahana, her 
attachment to her current friends remained. Even if she had to force 
herself, in a way, to remember those emotions. Arika blinked at the 
change that was now evident in the queen. She carried herself in a more 
mature fashion. Her voice was melancholy and less harsh than it had 
been. It was like meeting a different person. Arika tried to ignore it. 
Perhaps it was just because she was having a bad day!

&quot;There you are. Are you all right? Ann said that Natsuki sent people to 
kill you!&quot; Arika ran over to her friend and looked her over to make sure 
that she wasn&#39;t injured.

Mashiro waved the comments off. &quot;I&#39;m perfectly fine. Ann was a capable 
bodyguard. You&#39;d better not go back to Dammerung, though. Who knows what 
Natsuki might do. When was the last time you were there?&quot;

&quot;I left immediately after the contract was canceled.&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s in charge of the defense team?&quot; Ann asked.

&quot;Rosalie is.&quot; Arika laughed a little. &quot;This is like an interrogation or 
something!&quot;

Mashiro sighed and put a hand to her head, disappointed in herself. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, Arika. That&#39;s not what we&#39;re trying to do. It&#39;s just that we&#39;re 
in a bad situation. We&#39;re trying to remedy that, though, so we need the 
information.&quot;

Arika leaned in and poked her friend in the side. &quot;What&#39;s the matter 
with you? You&#39;re acting like you&#39;re forty years old!&quot;

&quot;I am not.&quot;

&quot;Are too.&quot;

&quot;I am... oh, nevermind!&quot; Mashiro growled, throwing her arms up in 
frustration. That action seemed to please Arika, as it was more like 
Mashiro&#39;s recent incarnation. It was after that Mashiro lowered her arms 
that an urgent thought came over her. She became distressed. &quot;Arika! Do 
you still have your GEM turned on?&quot;

&quot;Well, yeah!&quot; She said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. 
&quot;If you put the contract back up, I would just know automatically that 
way. Why?&quot;

&quot;Oh, just great.&quot; Now Ann had caught on. Her eyes turned skyward and she 
sighed in frustration.

Mashiro practically pounced on her Otome, fingers nimbly removing the 
piece of combat jewelry from the girl&#39;s ear. Arika shouted in protest as 
Mashiro hurled the Blue Sky Sapphire off into the woods with a throw 
that would make any baseball player proud. Arika&#39;s wail died down after 
a few seconds, replaced with whining. It wasn&#39;t much of a trade. &quot;Aw, 
Mashiro! Why did you do that?! It&#39;s going to be so hard to find, now!&quot;

&quot;Kruger can track down GEMs using Dammerung&#39;s monitoring equipment,&quot; 
Mashiro explained. &quot;She&#39;ll know we&#39;re here and send Shizuru after us. We 
have to get moving faster than I thought. The Star is probably close 
enough to destroy by now. I&#39;m getting the others together. Ann, wait 
here. Arika, you help tend to the ill while I&#39;m gone. It&#39;s hard to 
explain what&#39;s wrong with Yukino and the others. Just give them 
attention and care.&quot;

&quot;W-well, where are you going?&quot; Arika stammered. &quot;You can&#39;t just run off 
and have grand adventures without me! You&#39;re... you&#39;re spoiled and 
helpless! Like a rich baby!&quot;

&quot;Not anymore!&quot; Mashiro turned back, her eyebrow twitching in annoyance. 
She continued on her way, then, and the other two women followed her. 
When she reached the group of refugees that had gathered in that neck of 
the woods, she gathered there attention by clapping twice. &quot;Listen up, 
everyone! It&#39;s highly likely that Natsuki now knows that we&#39;re here! I 
want everyone to hike two miles southeast of here, heading back up in 
the mountains. Find a safe place to stay. Azumi will command the group 
after Minako&#39;s unfortunate passing. I know she will be a competent 
leader. My friend Arika will help care for the injured and ill. The 
Ikusahime will be leaving to destroy the Star and defeat the resurrected 
Obsidian Lord. Please wish us luck.&quot;

The crowd cheered them on as the Ikusahime gathered together, Mashiro in 
the center of the cluster. They huddled, almost as if they were going 
into a sporting event. The first thing to do was to create some kind of 
plan. Mashiro knew very little about the Guiding Star gone rogue. Aries 
had studied it the most after the war, and only limited information had 
been shared with Windbloom.

&quot;I don&#39;t know any technical information about the structure,&quot; Mashiro 
began. &quot;I do know that it was built around the time of colonization and 
that it obviously has the power to allow for global materialization. 
It&#39;s a large machine, so it might be easier to break down than the real 
HiME Star was. We&#39;ll have to look for any weak spots. I don&#39;t know if it 
has any point defense mechanism, so stay safe and be prepared to evade. 
Ann, you just let Yafusa do all the work and don&#39;t worry about anything 
other than telling him where and what to fire.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot;

&quot;Are you all ready?&quot; Mashiro asked. &quot;After this, we head straight for 
Dammerung to finish things.&quot;

They all nodded. Despite however tense the situation was, they could at 
least look forward to the fact that things were finally at the end. Even 
if some people fell before the final killing blow, it would be worth it. 
The Carnival of Man was a sin against all that was meant to happen. It 
was a human error fueled by greed and the lust for power. They could not 
afford to let the same thing happen again in another lifetime countless 
years in the future.

They summoned their Children and climbed onto their backs, rising into 
the air and heading up, and up, and up, and up. Soon they looked like 
nothing more than shooting stars sailing through the sky. Arika, still 
uncomfortable with all that was happening and her lack of information 
regarding it, yelled after them in an effort to be supportive. &quot;Do your 
best, Mashiro!&quot;

- - -

It took several minutes to break through the atmosphere, at which point 
the Children surrounded them in a field that locked in breathable air. 
It took the Children approximately thirteen minutes to reach the 
vicinity of the Guiding Star. The massive device was a blinding red 
after being drawn so close to the planet, and if one stared at it for 
too long it would pain their eyes. It was a simple sphere, lacking the 
fancy design the original HiME star sported. They flew around it, 
searching for anything to attack. Vague memories of Hollywood trench 
runs echoed in most of their minds, but even that did not seem helpful.

When Mai and Kagutsuchi reached the far side of the Star, soaring ahead 
of the others due to the dragon&#39;s impressive speed, she located a small 
abnormality, a circle of some kind, that she assumed was for space 
docking. Upon closer inspection, she found a door and a control panel, 
and decided that yes, it was surely some kind of docking mechanism so 
that technicians could come aboard. She briefly left Kagutsuchi in order 
to try and open the doors. The others watched from a distance, ready to 
act as guardians should anything go wrong.

Mai approached the control panel and scanned through the default menu. 
It was all in old world German, and she had trouble reading it. The 
dialect that Windbloom and most of the other Earl nations spoke had 
changed from the original language after years of separation. It was all 
slightly different. Going off root words and pictures, she seemingly 
found the controls to the door. After pressing the button on the touch 
screen, she frowned. Dammit, it needed a password!

Her eyes widened when she realized that a timer had gone off. Oh. Oh no. 
Was this bad? It must have wanted her to put in the password before the 
end of the countdown as a security device. Shit! She panicked and tried 
to find a cancel button. L&ouml;schen. Was that it? It was red. Red meant 
stop. She slammed her finger down on it as quickly as she could. The 
timer stopped. She sighed in relief.

As she began to retreat, she saw that many red lights now appeared on 
another display right above that one. She tensed and watched as several 
doors opened and either guns or missiles poked out from within. Oh, 
crap. There must have been a &#39;code&#39; for cancel that only Searrs 
employees of the day knew. Stupid, stupidFoundation. She briefly 
considered resurrecting all the old Searrs people just so that she could 
kill them with her bare hands.

Kagutsuchi instinctively fetched his mistress, and she hung on as he 
rocketed away at almost breakneck speed. The other Children seemed to 
catch on and began to fly evasively as the defenses automatically chose 
targets. A cluster of missiles was launched at the dragon, and 
Kagutsuchi spun and twirled through space as quickly as he could, 
soaring out of harms way and destroying any unavoidable missiles with 
his breath.

Guns turned on the slowest of the Children, the bulky Miroku. Most 
bullets were deflected by his thick outer shell. The Child brought up 
his spiked bat to shield Mikoto from fire as he tried to get out of the 
way. The swift Harry shot out of harm&#39;s way before Akane could even 
worry about being hit by stray fire, Yafusa following suit. Gennai and 
the beast Maitreya stayed out of range until an opening could present 
itself, neither wanting to risk an assault until some kind of logical 
action could be taken.

Ann decided to flex her new muscle. She patted Yafusa on the back and 
pointed to the sealed door that refused to open for Mai. Imitating 
Natsuki in hopes that it would be familiar to the wolf, she shouted, 
&quot;Yafusa! Load silver cartridge!&quot;

A cartridge was loaded into his single cannon&#39;s rotating chamber. He 
lined up according to her wishes and awaited confirmation. Just as a 
cluster of missiles prepared to fire on the stationary Child, Ann yelled 
out for him to fire. The silver cartridge shot through space and slammed 
into the door, large spears of ice ripping through the metal upon 
impact. When the ice vanished, a gaping hole remained in the tough outer 
armor. Gennai closed in and repeated the same kind of attack, bashing 
through the hull of the Star after a few strong hits. Both Yafusa and 
Gennai cleared away as the true powerhouses charged shots.

The vulnerable internal workings now exposed thanks to punctures, 
Kagutsuchi and Miroku launched fireballs into the wounds. The blasts 
tore through the structure and caused the glow of the giant machine to 
flicker on and off, clearing doing some major damage. As the two 
Children charged again, Yafusa and Maitreya launched their own ranged 
attacks. A chrome cartridge and a lower powered flame shot caused 
additional damage.

It was a second wave from Kagutsuchi and Miroku that put it all under. 
The star was not destroyed completely &#150; that would have only been 
possible with all Children or heavier weapons. As time was limited, they 
could not destroy it completely. But with all the damage inflicted, it 
was damaged beyond repair. The bright glow vanished altogether as large 
hunks of metal began to float away from the structure. When the defenses 
ceased to fire, Mai closed in again to check the control panel. Dead. 
The internal core of the machine was exposed and melted down.

Mashiro, satisfied with the destruction, signaled for them to return to 
the planet and head for Dammerung. The Obsidian Lord&#39;s last line of 
defense was gone. All surviving Ikusahime were free to attack the 
digital tyrant once and for all. They fell into an abstract formation 
and followed Mashiro back down through the atmosphere, falling down back 
towards Kyoto while wrapped in a blanket of fire.

- TGMS offline. Global materialization no longer operational.

The Obsidian Lord had dealt with a wide variety of &#39;difficult&#39; HiME over 
the many years it had been in charge of the Carnival. No single person 
had angered him quite like Kazahana Mashiro did. If the dark prince had 
to chose just one person to represent his supreme antagonist, it would 
be that lilac haired bitch. Even before her three hundred year learning 
process, she had been too intelligent and manipulative for her own good. 
He&#39;d been proud of it for just a moment. His warrior queen. And then... 
oh, and then she turned on him. She was a filthy, treacherous snake.

- EM-02: Establishing global link with EM-03 through EM-178. All 
Emulators connected to Kansai systems.
- Global materialization operational.

There. The Lord once again had access to a global materialization 
system. He didn&#39;t care to be dependent on just one Emulator. There was 
so much more to the world than the Kansai region. When this was over, 
his minions could travel to any location and manage to use their robes 
without troublesome reconfiguration. It was not as good as the TGMS was, 
but it was something. A crutch to be used in the absence of a leg.

&quot;That Nagasaki-born bitch is coming here to kill Alyssa,&quot; Natsuki said, 
referring to Mashiro. &quot;I will find a way to get Alyssa out of there, 
when this is all finished. I will release Natsuki, as well. I will no 
longer need this bag of meat when the Carnival is over. Then you can all 
live as a happy family again. Will you help me defend that young girl, 
Shizuru?&quot;

&quot;I have already said that I will. Do not make me repeat myself,&quot; Shizuru 
practically pleaded.

Natsuki gave her what was supposed to be a calming smile and caressed 
Shizuru&#39;s cheek. Tracing the elder woman&#39;s jaw with her fingertips, 
Natsuki came to rest on Shizuru&#39;s chin. She lifted it up, so that she 
was facing her directly, and planted a gentle kiss on Shizuru&#39;s lips. 
The Mistress of Kiyohime turned away after Natsuki released her, unable 
to look her in the eyes. Natsuki frowned at that, but decided that 
Shizuru&#39;s full emotional slavery was not necessarily important. So long 
as she would fight, it would be fine.

The possessed headmistress turned and walked back to her usual seat, and 
Shizuru quickly came to rest against her legs. While the Obsidian Lord&#39;s 
katana was present, a new weapon now found a home in Natsuki&#39;s hand. One 
of Kuga Natsuki&#39;s Desert Eagles. She had it recovered from the old 
Searrs facility where the original Natuski had perished. Memories told 
her exactly where it had fallen, and lo and behold, there it had been. 
She&#39;d cleaned it and loaded it with freshly made ammunition. The black 
hand cannon was comfortable, and in a way, Natsuki herself seemed more 
docile with it there. The Obsidian Lord did not complain about that one 
little bit.

As the Obsidian Lord patiently sat and waited for &#39;her&#39; guests to 
arrive, it&#39;s direct connection to all electronic equipment reported in 
with an odd anomaly that should not have occurred. The Obsidian Lord did 
not will it. The Obsidian Lord had not even thought about it.

-EM-03 through EM-178: Cores manually overloading. Detonation imminent.
- EM-03 through EM-178: Emulator security doors sealed. Access to cores 
denied.
- EM-02: Isolated from network.
- Program &#39;OL-001&#39; detected. Termination of processes b--

The Obsidian Lord blocked the attempt with great speed and efficiency. 
He prevented the information from reaching Natsuki&#39;s brain for fear of 
revolution, his fear likely to cause the woman to break free. One camera 
in the room panned over both the Emulator&#39;s inhabitant and the partially 
skinned but operational Miyu. The Yggdrasil unit&#39;s arm began to twitch, 
as if something was invading his control. Anger surged through his 
digital veins.

That artificial little reject.</pre>
