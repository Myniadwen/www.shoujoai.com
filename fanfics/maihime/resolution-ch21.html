<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Remember /  My letter #5</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mai  Tokiha had been many things in the course of her lifetime.  Some  things she still was, and some she had stopped being long ago.  She<em> was </em>still studious.  She <em>was </em>still hard-working and she <em>was </em>still clever, though not subtle.  She was <em>not </em>still  afraid of water.  She was <em>not </em>still a picky eater—she had  left that behind when she learned how to cook.  She was <em>not </em>still  a guilty soul, as she had been.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Maybe  not, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">But the  biggest thing Mai Tokiha was not was a fool.  She had never been a  fool, nor would she ever be a fool.  Even when she was being foolish,  Mai Tokiha was no fool. She could take care of herself, and she knew  what she was doing.  Maybe that was why she resented the look that  Natsuki gave her as Yuuichi frantically asked about Shiho, <em>had  anybody seen her, when was the last time anybody saw her? </em>The  look that Natsuki gave her was something she despised in that secret,  dark part of her that she allowed the luxury of hatred.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She was <em>not </em>a hateful person.  But she <em>was </em>somebody who felt  the draw of her pride very strongly.  So powerful, it was, that for a  moment she was tempted to go to Natsuki, to console<em> her </em>for  her obviously forlorn look so that maybe she would stop staring at  Mai that way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Crack.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The  gunshot echoed over the water and shut everybody up, the irritating  guest nobody invited to a party, clearing the room out in five  seconds flat.  Nobody moved for a few seconds, and then Chie started  to laugh.  “Just some stupid kids from the town with their  fireworks,” she said, waving her hand in front of her face  dismissively.  “Trying to see if they can get a rise out of the  dumb tourists.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Maybe  they would have even believed her, if not for the next two gunshots,  which echoed more clearly in their ears, punctuating her words as  though in direct defiance of some false prophet.  The cry of pain at  their end, a true believer mourning for his cause.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Everybody  froze, nobody quite sure what to say, and tension played across the  air like music from an untuned guitar.  Nobody corrected Chie in  spite of the conclusion drawn across the board; perhaps because none  of them were sore winners, but more likely because none of them  wanted her to be wrong.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">None of  them spoke, because nobody knew what to say. They all knew exactly  what that noise was, because although some of them had only really  heard it for the first time that day, the sound of human suffering  was unmistakable.  Nothing else came close—not animal pain, the  shrill, inarticulate howls of a confused, miserable beast; not angst,  the adolescent pain that all of them had, in one form or another,  experienced at some point during their high school years.  Nothing  could compare to the sound of somebody who possessed at least  rudimentary language skills reduced to articulating their pain the  same as the animals did.  Gooseflesh rose immediately on their skin,  almost as one.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Out of  all of them, it was Midori who reacted first.  Maybe because she’d  dealt with violent death before on an intimate level <em>outside </em>of  the HiME festival, or maybe simply because she was older and  therefore more mature, or maybe just because out of all of them, she  felt that she had the least to lose.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  going to go check it out,” she said quietly, all pretense and  preamble abandoned; then, after a moment’s consideration, “has  anybody seen Natsuki?” Even somebody with nothing to lose knew  better than to enter a battlefield without decent backup, and out of  all of them that had come to the carnival, only Natsuki seemed  halfway decent as backup.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Well, </em>Midori thought, <em>Natsuki and that man, Minoru. </em>But it  seemed fairly apparent to her that Minoru was probably at the center  of that shit-storm; he seemed to be the root of all of their troubles  up to that point, why stop then?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mai  shook her head.  She had dealt with death as well as Midori. Lots of  it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mikoto  blinked twice, and then murmured, “Is Mai going with Midori?”  almost before Mai had thought of it herself.  Suddenly, everybody’s  attention shifted to Mai, who went a little red in spite of herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Mai,”  Yuuichi said in a hollow impression of his usual jovial tone. “She’s  just being a little squirt; you’re not, right?” Yuuichi had never  called Mikoto a “squirt” before.  He had never really called her  anything before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mai took  half a second to make up her mind, but before she could say anything,  Midori said, her voice firm and a little overbearing, “No, you’re  not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mai  blinked, taken off-guard and momentarily stunned.  “I’m not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Midori  shook her head.  “No.  If this is…” <em>men with guns coming to  kill us,</em> “what we think it is, then we’ll need somebody to—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The  first bomb went off then, an enormous, rippling blast from a few  miles down the road, in Goza.  It destroyed what remained of the  burned-out strip mall that had been bombed earlier that day, but  nobody was hurt, since it was past dusk and nobody was out. The air  seemed to shiver for a few moments afterwards, and in its wake, all  heads turned towards Goza.  Chie, eyes wide and horrified, began to  shake violently, and Aoi took notice almost immediately, taking her  hand and squeezing hard, whispering something low and soothing in the  girl’s ear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Nobody  was hurt by the first bomb, but the second one more than made up for  it.  The bomb, the police would later discover, was not one but a  series of bombs, delivered from a larger submunitions explosive  inside of the back of a pickup truck, parked outside the house that  Natsuki had earlier laid siege to.  The first bomb ripped apart a  chunk of the street, but more importantly, sent over two hundred  smaller submunitions in all directions.  Forty of them pierced the  house’s exterior and detonated into even smaller explosives,  roughly hand-grenade sized, which also spread in all directions, a  bit like buckshot. One landed about two meters from the man with the  sad eyes, who had let Shizuru walk out of that house not a day ago,  resigning himself to a fate something very much like this.  The bomb  exploded and burned his face and eyes, but it was the second  submunition, which lodged itself in his stomach, that killed him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The  house literally collapsed on itself, pierced in so many places, its  foundation so weakened, that a child could have toppled it if the  force of the blast hadn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Four  more houses around it, the other four corners of that intersection,  suffered similar fates. One boy of fifteen was killed, riding his  bicycle back home from the house of a girl who he had been helping  study and on whom he harbored a powerful crushed. The largest piece  of him anybody ever found was his hand, which had grasped that of the  girl momentarily before he left for the night.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Nobody  ever figured out how somebody had managed to sneak that much  U.S.-bought military grade anti-tank explosive into the country.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">None of  the kids at Goza knew of these happenings, but as screams and sirens  began to rise from the town, carrying surprisingly well in the cool,  moist night air and echoing nicely through the forests, it became  obvious that they could guess at them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">There  was a moment’s silence after the first two bombs went off (and  about ten minutes before the second two exploded) and then Midori  said, “That does it. Mai, get everybody into the house.  I’ll  accompany you that far, because there’s…something I should get  from in there, but you goddamn keep them there and goddamn keep them  safe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">It took  Mai a moment to get her thoughts in order well enough to offer a  protest.  “Midori, no.  I should be with you, me and Mikoto, so we  can—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So  you can what? So you can get yourselves shot?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  know how to take care of myself,” Mai snapped, suddenly angry at  being thought of as something weak and helpless, something to be  taken care of, not once but <em>twice </em>in less than twenty minutes,  and by two people who she respected more than anybody. “Don’t  treat me like a—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  don’t have a <em>clue </em>what you’re up against here,” Midori  said hotly.  “Not. A. Clue.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  don’t have any more of an idea than I do,” Mai shot back.  “And  would you stop cutting me—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">This  time, it was Mikoto who stopped her midsentence, tugging at her shirt  intently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mai  stopped, and looked down at her.  Looked down into the girl’s  soothing eyes, hard with years of fighting and paranoia but still  somehow possessing just that little twinge of childish innocence, of  the endearment that one couldn’t help but afford to cute little  girls. For just that brief moment, Mai marveled, thinking, <em>this  should be the eighth wonder of the world.  Mikoto, how did you ever  manage…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Mai  should stay here,” Mikoto murmured.  “Mai is scared for Shiho,  because Yuuichi is scared for Shiho, but Mai can’t do anything in  there, and nobody else can keep everybody safe.” In her voice was  not a challenge, nor condescension as one might have when trying to  win an argument, but only the utmost confidence; that childish belief  that what she said was true because it was about <em>Mai, </em>and Mai  could do just about anything in the world.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">In the  face of such faith, such pure, unreserved admiration and need, Mai’s  anger melted as quickly as it had kindled. She glanced at Yuuichi for  a moment, Yuuichi whose eyes were desperate, frightened, and then  turned back to Midori and nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  will.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Good,”  Midori said. “Everybody get to the cabin.  It’s not safe there,  but it’s safer than anywhere else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What  about the van?” Reito asked, his voice calm and under control,  reassuring as the third bomb exploded and more people died and a few  people lived, all without ever knowing why. “We could probably  drive somewhere where it’s safer and wait for your call.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No,” Midori said.  “If they’ve come for us here, they’ll  have done something to the van by now, or they’ll have somebody  watching it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Who’s  to say they don’t have somebody watching the cabin?” Reito  frowned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Nobody,”  Midori murmured, all-to-aware that he was right.  “But we’ve got  nowhere else to go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Reito  nodded solemnly, understanding.  “I’ll help Mai after I find  Kazuya and Akane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Heaters  to block infra-red sights, and perhaps a circle of power around the  cabin to warn you if somebody enters, </em>something inside of his  head said, and he shivered involuntarily.  Maybe if not for the  latter advice, words from a day long gone, he could have lived with  it, but as it was, he knew exactly whose voice that was speaking to  him, and he hated it. And himself, for having it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">To  escape it, he escaped the group, moving off to look for Kazuya and  Akane.  He had a rough idea of where they were, and he would have to  move quickly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Midori  smiled tightly. <em>Thank you, professor, </em>she thought with more  than a twinge of pain. <em>For letting me onto that little trick  they’ve pulled with the van. </em>Not a car-bomb, of course. You  couldn’t plant one of those on a car without about an hours’  solitary work, and the beach parking lot was anything but solitary,  with over thirty occupied cabins stretching down the road.  (A few  people now were starting to emerge from these cabins, curious but not  concerned about the ruckus).  Rather, they’d have somebody with a  gun either waiting inside of it or just a few cars down.  Maybe they  would, as somebody had once done to her on one of her adventures with  the professor, have people come with nail guns to quickly seal the  doors, and simply tow the van away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>And  who are </em>they? She wondered briefly.  She thought for a moment it  might be one of the enemies she’d made in Israel, but it occurred  to her that not even they would go to such brutal extremes to take  revenge on her—because it was, very obviously, (to her, at least)  somebody in her group that was being targeted.  All of the guns  seemed to revolve around them that day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Should  have asked Minoru when you had the chance; stupid, stupid girl. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She  shook her head, refusing to succumb to those kinds of thoughts, at  least right now.  There would be plenty of time for self-loathing  later; she knew that quite well from her years of bathing in alcohol  to keep herself from precisely that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Okay.  Everyone in the cabin. Can she walk?” She indicated Chie with a  nod, and Aoi nodded grimly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  think so, but I wouldn’t count on her to run,” she said quietly.  “That thing in Goza hit her pretty hard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Midori  took a moment to marvel at Aoi’s quiet strength then; Chie was by  and far the more forward, the more vocal of the two, the tougher in a  crowd, the more frank in a discussion, but of them, it seemed that  Aoi was the one keeping the tempo set, the music going, and anybody  from knowing that the conductor had actually died at his podium.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They set  off for the cabin together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">--</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The  seconds inside of the cabin ticked by agonizingly, at least to  Natsuki, as the man with the knife attempted to stare Natsuki down.  It was pretty obvious to her that he was a little bit afraid, and  Natsuki could not for the life of her understand why—it was him  that had the knife, him that had the gun at his side. He was large  and solidly built, and she had no idea how he had managed to get into  the cabin undetected. Shizuru seemed entirely calm; indeed, Natsuki  had no idea if she even <em>knew </em>there was a man standing behind  her; she hadn’t seemed (admittedly, Natsuki had only seen her  shadow) to react when he appeared. Was there something somebody was  missing?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">It was  possible.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">What was  more important at that moment was whether or not Natsuki thought she  was fast enough to make a play for her gun.  It was in her bag, which  meant she would have to find a way to get it open before the man  gutted Shizuru, which seemed unlikely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>You  could go for him, too. You could take him. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Who’s  to say that? Who’s to say he has no backup? Who’s to say he’s  not just going to cut Shizuru’s throat the instant you flinch?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Is  there something wrong, Natsuki?” Shizuru asked gently.  “You seem  frightened.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>What  in the hell is she—</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  walked in on me at a rather inopportune moment.  If you could,  perhaps, step outside while I finish…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Natsuki  gaped. <em>What in the </em>hell <em>is she…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The  man glared at Natsuki.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Natsuki  did her best to glare back, and then she knew, but she also knew that  what Shizuru had in mind wouldn’t happen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Natsuki  wouldn’t let it, but she couldn’t stop it, either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Not  without her bag.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m…very  sorry, Shizuru,” Natsuki murmured. “I didn’t mean—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“To  stare?” Shizuru teased. “You seem to have done a very thorough  job of it nonetheless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">In spite  of herself, Natsuki couldn’t help but notice…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">There  was, indeed, quite a bit to stare at. No wonder the girls at Fuuka  Academy worshipped Shizuru.  She was<em> perfect</em>—firm everywhere  she should have been firm, pale where she needed to be, dark…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She was  only dark in one spot aside from her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Natsuki  reddened, and then said, her throat fairly well choking, “I just  came in to get something out of my bag.  I’ll—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“By  all means, take it, but then…I’m getting rather cold.”  Guiltily, Natsuki traced her eyes down Shizuru’s slim neck, across  her collarbones, and then down…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">and it  was true.  Shizuru <em>was</em> getting cold.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Natsuki  stared at her one more time, still slightly disbelieving. <em>She  means to let herself be taken. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>To  protect </em>me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She  grabbed her bag quickly, her eyes never leaving Shizuru’s, and  started for the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Fuck  that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">In  the dim light of the cabin, she could see the man’s big arms moving  towards Shizuru again.  But with</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>shizuru</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">the  pressure gone, Natsuki was able to act again, and quickly.  She had  the gun out in half a second, and in the light of the cabin, she  didn’t need to re-enter the room to aim.  She aimed for the man’s  back, where she was certain Shizuru <em>wasn’t, </em>clicked the  safety off, and shot him. The gun gave a single hard report and the  man dropped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Something <em>clicked, </em>and it wasn’t her, and suddenly Natsuki realized  why Shizuru had consented to be taken without a fight. She had less  than half a second to drop to the ground, and then a second shot <em>cracked </em>from inside the boys’ bedroom, through the wall that  Yuuichi had pounded in frustration less than a day ago, when their  largest worries encompassed who was watching them snog.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shizuru  was out in half a second, a robe thrown half-heartedly about her  shoulders, barely covering up</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>firm</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">what  needed covering up, and then the man behind the door opened up with  his machine gun.  Shizuru flung herself to the ground as soon as the  first shot went off, and holes started to appear in the cabin, the  sand outside <em>puffing </em>as the bullets lodged themselves in the  hill.  She landed on top of Natsuki, who didn’t dare fire back—the  only reason they were still alive was that the man didn’t know  where they were now—he knew where Shizuru had been, though. The  wall behind where Shizuru and the man had been standing a moment  before was nothing more than a bunch of holes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">It  actually took Natsuki a few seconds to realize who had landed on her.   She blocked out the feeling of</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>warm</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shizuru’s  body as best she could. <em>No distractions. Not now. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Nobody  could fire an automatic weapon for more than a few seconds at a time,  though; whoever held the weapon started to burst fire, poking  seemingly random holes in the cabin’s structure, searching.  Natsuki clamped her hand over Shizuru’s mouth.  Shizuru didn’t  even try to make a sound, but Natsuki felt better doing it all the  same. She began aiming with her gun, trying to pick out the exact  source of the shots.  Maybe she would have even found it before the  man found her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">But  before that could happen, several things happened, all at once.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The door  opened, revealing the entire group save for Reito, Akane, and Kazuya;  Midori, at their head, had about enough time to gasp.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">At the  same time, Minoru Alder managed to draw a bead on the little fucker  with the machine gun, holed up behind a bunch of heavy wooden crates  in the boy’s room, where he had been laying not half a day ago as  Midori fixed his wrist. He had his head in full view through the  window—<em>fucking amateurs are getting easier to kill every  year—time was, amateurs had that youthful shit and vigor. </em>He  breathed, once, twice, and the guy still didn’t move, so he put a  fist-sized hole through his head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">He  didn’t know it then, but in doing this, he saved over half a dozen  lives: The man had been about three seconds from firing over his  rapidly-constructed barricade—made from heavy blocks of wood and  cardboard boxes that he’d brought in with him—at the door,  assuming it was Natsuki and Shizuru making for a quick getaway. He  would have taken Midori’s head off and put a hole in Mai’s lung  the size of a baseball.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Instead,  he slumped to the ground, blood and gray matter leaking out of his  head, and Minoru said, “You can open your eyes now, kid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shiho  uncovered her eyes, and gazed at Minoru in wonder for a moment.  “Did…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  killed him, yeah,” Minoru murmured. “I’m going to take you down  there now, but I don’t want you going in that room. Okay?” No kid  should have to see that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">He  didn’t know that she already had that day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">If he  had, maybe he would have set off right then and there to find  Scratch-ass and take him apart, a fist-sized chunk at a time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">It was  probably for the best that he didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">--</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Natsuki  stood up, recovering quickest, doing her best to put herself between  Shizuru and the rest of them. “Everybody,” she said quietly.  “Inside.  Stay out of both of the rooms.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Nobody  asked her what in the hell was going on. Nobody needed to; of all of  them, only Chie and Aoi were even sort of in the dark; the rest of  them guessed at roughly the same thing (whether or not it was  technically accurate seemed almost irrelevant): Revenge.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Revenge  for the Carnival.  Who it was seemed an impossible guess—how many  people had they hurt? How many countless people had they hurt or  killed in those horrible, bloody months?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Reito  showed up a few moments later with Akane and Kazuya, neither clad in  much more than they were born in and both appearing a mildly pathetic  mixture of embarrassed and frightened. He and Midori went to set up  traps by the windows.  Reito used the barr</span><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">icades—the ones <em>without </em>blood on them—to block the gaping hole that had been made in  the girls’ room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  led Natsuki outside. Natsuki protested, but Shizuru insisted, and  when they were out, and the rest in, Shizuru took her robe off again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  are—” Natsuki managed, and then Shizuru was on her, hugging her  tightly, squeezing her about the midsection, where a sort of fire  seemed to light, beginning in her belly and spreading all the way up  through her breast.  Her eyes widened in surprise, and then in  something else.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you,” Shizuru murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  didn’t know what to say, and, after a moment, Shizuru let go.  They  stared at each other for a moment in mildly comfortable, if electric,  silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But,”  Shizuru whispered. “I’m going.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You </em>what?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re  here for me, Natsuki,” Shizuru said.  “<em>He…</em>” it was  obvious who <em>he </em>was, “told me. He said that if he had me,  none of you would ever have to meet them. So I’m going.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  froze, and the fire in her belly abruptly turned to ice. Her eyes  stopped seeing Shizuru, started seeing…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Seeing  Shizuru.  Seeing her die.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Seeing  her die again.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  didn’t know a lot of things about herself. If there was one thing  Natsuki was not, it was honest with herself; in fact, some days she  could hardly remember when she had last been on speaking terms with  the honest facts about herself.  She no longer knew what these facts <em>were, </em>and whenever somebody confronted her with them, she did  what she was doing now: She froze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t know how she felt about Shizuru. She didn’t know if she  could love her the way Shizuru wanted.  She had kissed her earlier  that day, but she hadn’t felt right when Shizuru had kissed back,  later. She had rescued her without a second thought, but that had  almost been relieving; a break from the tedium, from the conflicting  feelings that she had felt building for months before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  had never really thought about the prospect of <em>coming out. </em>About  what it meant.  About any of it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But as  Shizuru gave her hand one last squeeze, one which she barely felt  from the numbness that had begun to run through her body, she knew  that what she <em>didn’t </em>need was even <em>less </em>time to try  and sort it out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And she  knew that touching Shizuru had felt damn good.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl  turned to leave, giving her a look that mixed sadness, hurt, and  dread in equal measures, and before she was halfway around, Natsuki  grabbed her by the shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Maybe  you just get off on these kind of situations.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Maybe  you get off on the thrill.  Maybe you just don’t know how to want  something until somebody takes it away from you.  Maybe …</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Maybe  you’re just fucked up.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  was the last thing that would have ever surprised Natsuki Kuga.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  looked at Natsuki, her eyes blank.  Resigned to death.  Natsuki had  seen that expression before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then  Shizuru pulled away again and started to walk towards the hill.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For the  second time in only a few minutes, Natsuki thought, <em>fuck this.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  grabbed Shizuru again, moving with a speed born of years of paranoia,  and whirled her around, more forcefully this time, only to be met  with the same dead eyes.  Eyes that had nothing left to see in this  world.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Fuck  it all.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before  she had time to ponder the finer points of what <em>coming out </em>really  meant, she pulled the naked girl to her, her heart lighting up again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  don’t know what I want. I don’t know if I want you or not. I  don’t know if I love you, or if I’m just grateful to you for  being the first to try and end my solitude.  I don’t know if I feel  happy because you’re my friend or something more. I don’t even  know if I can be attracted to women.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  as she took one last gaze on Shizuru’s body, the last seemed to  answer itself as Natsuki, for the first time in her life, took the  initiative and not the offensive.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru’s  lips were dry this time, and she didn’t react at first.  Even for  Shizuru, the great bastion of <em>cool, </em>of <em>in command, </em>the  prospect of walking into death, even for those she loved, was too  much for her psyche to bear, so she numbed herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  did a fine job of melting her.  Her lips were hot on Shizuru’s, and  her hands pressed themselves into Shizuru, one at the small of her  back, one about the girl’s bare shoulders.  Shizuru’s skin was as  soft as it was smooth, and after a moment, she started to kiss back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Maybe, </em>Natsuki thought, in a moment of something a little less intense  than giddiness but a little more powerful then contentness, <em>we  have a shot at this after all.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  prayed that Shizuru would agree with her.</span></p>
