<p>La Danse des  Vagues</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
It was always the same  flowers, but it was never on the same day...
<p>It was always at the  same place, but never for the exact same reason…</p>
<p>It was always the same  emptiness, and that never changed.</p>
<p>I stood on the edge of  that cliff, staring out at the seemingly endless ocean as the sun  kissed the earth on the horizon. There was a light breeze as there  usually was around a large body of water, and it took the liberty to  play with my hair and cool my features as I silently remained  stationary. My hold on the light bouquet in my hands relaxed, and as  I gazed down, I watched it flutter towards the cerulean abyss below,  but averted my eyes before I could witness it being consumed.</p>
<p>“Mother…”</p>
<p>White lilies had always  been her favorite flowers. I guess I’ll never know why she loved  them so much, but I can remember there always being a vase full of  them at home and at her office. Every now and then it was dad who  would bring them home, the two of them exchanging a kiss before  chatting away about their day. Occasionally he would buy them for me  to take to her at work, and when I would arrive, mother and I would  go through the same procedure as she would with father. Maybe that’s  what they were to her…love…simple and unconditional. But that  love had faded over time. It became tired and worn, and after that  day, the day that brought me to this very spot where I now stood, it  disappeared from my life.</p>
<p>Coming to this place  wasn’t a daily or weekly occurrence. It was never anything planned  or thought about. I would come simply when I felt that I needed to.  If I had a particularly bad day, or if I had a good day. If I was  depressed, or if I was happy. If I needed someone to talk to, or if I  just felt like telling mom what I had been up to lately. And  sometimes it was to refocus…to reassure myself none of this was  just a bad dream and that everything I was fighting for wasn’t in  vain.</p>
<p>Today was different  though. I was about to delve into something I particularly didn’t  want to get into. It was all Yamada’s fault. He had given me the  initiative to return to that place after all these years, and I think  I had come to my mother’s watery grave to make sure it was okay  with her to do so…and to apologize in advance.</p>
<p>The First District  Research Facility…I had gone there several times as a child so it’s  location wasn’t anything unknown to me. To be perfectly honest, I  was afraid to go there…to dig up those memories of my mother...of a  time in my life when I actually felt normal and content and I didn’t  have to worry about HiME or revenge…But to not investigate that  place, it would be passing up an open opportunity to find more clues  to lead me to my goal, so when Yamada happened to mention it, I felt  like it was the last push I needed to finally venture inside, despite  whether I was emotionally ready to or not.</p>
<p>I wasn’t reckless  enough to jump in head first, mind you. Vaguely recalling that I had  seen the man at that very building before, I had gone to Sakomizu  after school one day to question him about the facility. He had  proceeded to warn me not to investigate the place, arguing it was  dangerous and whatnot, and I of course had stubbornly ignored his  protests, and by the end of it all I had received his phone number  and a promise that he would look into the level of security  surrounding the run-down laboratory. Having won that small victory,  my conscious was eased, if even by just the tiniest bit, about the  whole situation.</p>
<p>After that it was  simply a waiting game. It was the end of the first term of my  freshman year, which meant exams were about to begin. I actually took  the time to study and attend class and felt that I had done pretty  decent on the tests even though I had enough on my mind already. With  those out of the way, I could solely direct my attention back to the  previous matter at hand, another mission that started right at this  very moment.</p>
<p>I said my quiet  goodbye, and finally releasing myself from my statuary state, I  turned back towards the road, stepped over the side rail, and  straddled my Ducati once again.</p>
<p>I drove for several  minutes, only the steady rumbling of my bike and the sound of my own  breathing inside of my helmet to keep me company as I traced the last  path my mother and I ever traveled together. It didn’t take me long  to reach the first entry gate, and once there, it became quite  evident that they had securely sealed the place off. I slowed to a  stop on the road looking over the vacant building, and once I had  removed my helmet, I immediately fetched my phone.</p>
<p>“It’s me.”</p>
<p>“<em>Ah!? Yes, the  security system is active,” </em>Sakomizu began, making sure to keep  his voice low,<em> “So, you see…there’s nothing left there. Why  would you want to go there?”</em></p>
<p>“You have no reason  to know,” I snapped before promptly hanging up.</p>
<p>“If I weren’t out  of moves…who would want to come here?” I whispered to the wind,  my thoughts slipping to my mother, but I was quickly shaken out of my  daze when the sound of a speeding car burned my ears.</p>
<p>I jerked my head up and  watched as the sporty looking red and black vehicle whipped around  the corner up ahead and proceeded to zoom right past me. I couldn’t  shake the feeling that it looked oddly familiar, but I didn’t have  the time to bother with such a useless question, so instead I slipped  my helmet back on and started the engine of my bike again.</p>
<p><em>All the entrances to  the facility are blocked and laced with alarms no doubt...The ocean  is the only option now. I guess the next step is to find the closest  beach and decide what to do from there.</em></p>
<p>Walking my bike in a U-turn, I backtracked to the main road to begin  my search for a possible entry point to my destination.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Fujino-san!”
<p>“Hello, Fujino-san!”</p>
<p>“Did you have a  pleasant ride here?”</p>
<p>“Let me take your bag  for you!”</p>
<p>I had only just arrived  at the Suzushiro villa, and it had already begun. It was the  beginning of the summer break, and the first event that was taking  place was a weekend beach getaway for all of those who had helped in  organizing the School Anniversary Celebration. Being the student  council president, that of course included me, but it also involved  my “fan club” that had adamantly volunteered their time when the  announcement that additional outside help would be needed had first  been made a week before the festival began.</p>
<p>And now here a select  few of those girls stood before me, clearly having been awaiting my  arrival so they could immediately latch onto me and remain that way  for the remainder of the trip. To say that their presence was a total  bother wouldn’t be entirely true. I have to admit that at times I  did enjoy the attention, but in the end, that’s all it  was…attention. Of course, if you asked any of them, they would  probably profess their childish love for me, or something ridiculous  like that, and maybe some of them really did, but they didn’t love<em>me</em>, they loved the perfect little student council president  named Fujino Shizuru. They couldn’t love <em>me</em> because I never  showed my true self to anyone…except for maybe Natsuki…or at  least I would try to at times, but I was afraid of showing that side  of myself to her sometimes, especially the part of me that secretly  admired her from afar…the part of me that longed for her...</p>
<p>Natsuki…I hadn’t  seen or talked to her since the night of the anniversary celebration.  It was understandable, exams did tend to be a busy time for most  students, herself included, but I had hoped to receive a surprise  late night visit from the girl requesting my aid in her studying, and  was disappointed when it never came.</p>
<p>But now wasn’t the  time for that. It was summer vacation, a time to relax, especially  considering the fact that I would really only have a week before I  would have to get back to taking care of student council business.</p>
<p>Smiling, I handed my  bag over to the spiky auburn-haired girl in front of me, “Ookini.”</p>
<p>The girl quietly  squealed as I forfeited my belongings to her, and I nearly laughed at  the idea of someone being so overly thrilled to perform simple manual  labor such as this.</p>
<p>“Well then,” I  continued, “shall we go get changed and head on to the beach?”</p>
<p>Needless to say, there  wasn’t a single protest.</p>
<p>After entering the  mansion and having one of the kind butlers escort me to the room I  would be occupying for the weekend, fortunately to myself under  Haruka-san’s authority apparently, I would have to be sure to thank  her later, I quickly changed. I took a moment to enjoy my solitary  peace before venturing back outside to the front entrance where my  harem patiently waited. They were at my side the moment I was  noticed.</p>
<p>“Are you ready,  Fujino-san? We’ve already prepared a bag of items you might need—“</p>
<p>“—And we have an  umbrella for you to use—“</p>
<p>“—And a towel—“</p>
<p>“Ara, ara…how  thoughtful of you all…” I commented and received a few gleeful  looks in response. “If we have everything, then let us be on our  way.”</p>
<p>My little entourage  attacked the doors trying to be the first one to hold it open for me  to pass.</p>
<p><em>Really, this is too  comical…</em></p>
<p>“F-Fujino-san?  Sh-Shall we take a car?” one of the shyer girls piped up.</p>
<p>“Walking is fine,”  I answered, and no sooner had the words left my mouth, the poor  underclassman quickly became the target of many heated glares.</p>
<p>It only took us a few  minutes to reach the sandy beach, the ocean consuming my senses in  full…or at least it did before the screaming began. I continued  walking and was taken aback when I laid eyes on the giant fish  rapidly approaching the shore.</p>
<p>“Mai! Dinner!” the  thing exclaimed in a familiar voice, and when I followed the eye line  of the overgrown ara, I saw that there was in fact one Tokiha Mai  standing atop the lifeguard stand to my right.</p>
<p>I took the girls  bewildered silence as my cue to jump in, “Big fish, is it not?”</p>
<p>“Kaicho-san…?”  the busty redhead questioned almost as equally perplexed as before.</p>
<p>“How energetic you  are,” I added, turning my attention to Mikoto who had revealed  herself underneath the belly of the monster fish.</p>
<p>Once the scene had died  down, but not before Haruka could prove to the world that she was  indeed a blonde, I trekked a little ways away from my previous  position and claimed the empty spot as my own. The girls immediately  busied themselves with setting up my spot to lay out as I snuck down  to the ocean and let the cool water wash over my legs. When my  absence was discovered, which didn’t take very long, I reluctantly  returned to my awaiting towel, and after somehow managing to dry my  own legs off, I lied down on my stomach to start working on a  much-needed tan.</p>
<p>I had just undone the  tie to my bathing suit and settled down into a comfortable position  when the arguing began.</p>
<p>“No, I’m doing it!”</p>
<p>“No, I want to, too!”</p>
<p>I peeked a single eye  open as I gazed over my shoulder, “Come on now, don’t fight over  it.”</p>
<p>They paused for a  second to flash apologetic faces at me before the tug of war resumed.</p>
<p><em>At this rate, I’ll  never get any sunscreen…</em></p>
<p>“How about,” I  interrupted again, “one of you do it today, and the other can  tomorrow, ne?”</p>
<p>The one with short dark  hair, I believed her name to be Rina, made a final pull and won the  bottle, “I’m first then.”</p>
<p>“It’s settled,” I  was quick to chime in before any more protests could be made.</p>
<p>The other girl who had  been battling merely huffed her understanding and backed down.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before  a pair of hands began slowly messaging the cool lotion onto my back  and I closed my eyes at the soothing sensation. An image formed in my  mind, and I couldn’t hold back the smile that formed on my lips,  but at the same time my brain continued to question…</p>
<p><em>Is it wrong of me to imagine that Natsuki is the one doing this?</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
When I finally reached  a plausible departure spot, I pulled my bike over to the side of the  road, cut the engine, and after I had booted the kickstand and  removed my gloves, I made my way down to the beach. I walked down to  the water’s edge, unzipping my leather suit while peering into the  distance where I could see a jut of land and the building I was  currently trying to get to.
<p><em>Mmm…A little  further than I thought…I guess swimming is out of the question. I’m  sure there’s a boat rental around here somewhere—!</em></p>
<p>The sound of a sharp  intake a breath from above startled me, and I jerked my head in the  direction to seek out the source at once. Of course, when my eyes  landed on a particularly persistent kendo captain, I immediately  released a startled scream and wrapped my arms around my partially  exposed torso.</p>
<p>“W-Why are you  here?!”</p>
<p>Takeda continued to  stare down at me completely dumbfounded, “I was…Since the  tournament is closing in, I thought I’d train my mentality.”</p>
<p>“Then get out of  here!” I commanded, hugging myself even tighter.</p>
<p>“Y-You too, why are  you…?”</p>
<p>As the male began to  mumble his words, I noticed the slight flushing of his cheeks, and  following his lingering gaze, I immediately knew what he was staring  at.</p>
<p>Instantly I crouched to  the ground, trying to find some kind of cover in the shadows, “None  of your business!”</p>
<p>“It is! It is too!”  Takeda suddenly protested, seeming to regain his determination,  “Because I…”</p>
<p>Before he could finish,  I heard a crumbling noise, and the next thing I knew, the kendo  captain was on top of me. My eyes widened and I couldn’t move. I  couldn’t even say anything at all when he finally realized where he  was. Our petrified staring contest was only shattered when the sound  of a concerned voice rang out from above us.</p>
<p>“Are you all right?”</p>
<p><em>Oh god! Not you! Not  now!</em></p>
<p>“I heard…”</p>
<p>Yep. It was Mai.  Staring down at a very real Masashi Takeda suggestively atop an  equally real me. I wanted to hurl.</p>
<p>Mai stopped for a  moment, her mind obviously trying to process what she was seeing,  before she flinched and bolted, “Sorry for interrupting!”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Takeda  was the first to speak, “No, this is—!”</p>
<p>I took the open space  he had created to strike. Planting my palms on the ground by my head,  I pulled my knees to my chest and sprung. Feet met chest, and in the  blink of an eye, the male was flat on his back. As he rubbed the back  of his unquestionably aching head, I grabbed the wooden sword of his  and rose from my kneeling position.</p>
<p>“Why you…” I  seethed, fists shaking with rage, “You perverted bastard!”</p>
<p>“N-No—“ he began  to stammer, but his pleas failed to reach my fury-induced deaf ears  as I reared back and struck him with as much force as I could muster,  snapping the frail weapon in half in the process.</p>
<p>His body went limp  after that, clearly unconscious from the blow I had just served. My  eye twitched as I threw the now useless sword onto the ground beside  him, wishing that it had been a real one rather than just wood. I did  get a <em>little</em> satisfaction from the red whelp that had already  begun to form on his dumb face though.</p>
<p>“Mai…” I uttered  through clenched teeth before dead sprinting back up to the road, and  to my luck the girl hadn’t gone very far at all.</p>
<p>“Hey!” I called out  to her as I continued to run in her direction.</p>
<p>“Natsuki…S-Sorry  about—!“</p>
<p>Grabbing the girl by  her jacket, I looked her dead in her violet eyes, “Look! You didn’t  see what you thought you saw, got it? That idiot fell on top of me.  That’s all.”</p>
<p>“O-Okay,” Mai  nodded in understanding, and I released my grip on her. After she had  straightened herself out and taken a step back, she spoke again,  “But…what are you doing here anyway?”</p>
<p>“…There’s a First  District building nearby. I’m going to check it out,” I answered  and started walking towards my motorcycle.</p>
<p>Mai was quick to  follow, “Eh? You serious?”</p>
<p>“I don’t joke  around about this stuff,” I retorted, stripping out of my biker  suit now that there were no leering male eyes to observe me.</p>
<p>“Can I come?”</p>
<p>Hoping to avoid a  dispute, I sighed, “As long as you don’t get in my way.”</p>
<p>I opened the back  storage compartment on my Ducati and retrieved a small black tote  bag, replacing it with my suit before closing the top. I flung the  light carrier over my shoulder before storming off back towards the  beach.</p>
<p>“Um…forgive me for  asking, but what happened to Takeda-san?”</p>
<p>“Take a look for  yourself,” I coldly stated, motioning behind me with my thumb.</p>
<p>Mai obviously saw the  male lying on the ground even as we trekked in the opposite  direction, “Are you sure you can leave him like that?”</p>
<p>“Why would I care  about him?”</p>
<p>“But that sure  surprised me. You looked like you had no interest in guys, so I was  starting to think other things about you...”</p>
<p>I froze, “Don’t  even joke like that! I have things to take care of…I have no time  for relationships.”</p>
<p>“Oooh…It must be  nice to be simple like that.”</p>
<p>Slightly intrigued by  her last comment, I decided to turn the questions her way, “What,  you’re having problems with Kanzaki?”</p>
<p>“No, not like that…”  the girl began before actually letting my words sink in, “Wait, why  Reito-san?!”</p>
<p>“It’s a rumor all  over the school,” I replied, not even attempting to hold back an  amused smirk.</p>
<p>We remained silent for  the rest of the hike down the shore until we approached the small  rental shack, and I promptly jumped up onto the wooden planks of the  walkway.</p>
<p>“This place is  closed, you know,” Mai tentatively informed me.</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>The girl crawled up and  followed me as I wandered down to the small dock that housed a few  small rowboats and crouched down beside the one closest to the end. I  sat my bag down beside me as I fished out a tool to pick the lock  holding the boat to its current residence before setting to work.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?  You can’t just take one!”</p>
<p>“No one else is using  it right now,” I remarked as I continued fiddling with the device.  It wasn’t long before it softly clicked and opened. I smirked  triumphantly before placing my utensil back into the black bag and  carefully crawling into the boat.</p>
<p>Plopping down on one of  the seats, I threw my bag behind me and took the rows into my hands.  Mai just continued to look at me from her place on the dock.</p>
<p>“I’m not waiting  forever.”</p>
<p>“…Fine…” the  busty girl finally complied with a dissatisfied shake of her head.</p>
<p>Once she was securely  inside, I began the monotonous action of propelling us towards the  distant coastline. The girl across from me kept quiet, her arms  crossed over her chest accompanied by a small pout.</p>
<p>Eventually she calmed  down, but that still didn’t cease her whining, “Taking a rental  boat without permission…You know this is a crime.”</p>
<p>“If you have a  problem with it, then don’t tag along.”</p>
<p>“But if it’s  related to First District stuff, I want to know too.”</p>
<p>“I thought you  weren’t getting involved with the battles of HiMEs,” I honestly  remarked, half a question, half a statement.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but…I see it  even if I pretend not to, so…”</p>
<p>I nearly smiled at the  comment.</p>
<p><em>Don’t we all…</em></p>
<p>“Say, Kuga-san…”  she continued.</p>
<p>“Natsuki is fine.”</p>
<p>“Then call me Mai, as  well. Why are you fighting, Natsuki?”</p>
<p>I paused in my rowing,  allowing her question to fully sink in as I debated on telling her  the whole truth, “I’m…”</p>
<p>I wasn’t given the  time to continue, however, as an arm reached over the side of the  boat, it’s fingers twitching as if it were searching for something.</p>
<p>Mai and I both screamed  in horror as we grabbed onto each other and tried to put as much  distance between the stray appendage and ourselves. More movement,  and a head surfaced, eyes gleaming in the moonlight. Our grips  tightened as we nearly cried out again. But then the  goggles—Wait…goggles?</p>
<p>“No fair, playing  without me,” pouted the annoyed dark-haired HiME.</p>
<p>“Mikoto…” Mai  barely managed.</p>
<p>Once my heart had  started beating again, I harrumphed and pushed the redhead away,  “Honestly…”</p>
<p>After helping the  younger girl into the boat, we continued onward, and after a few  minutes, I ceased my paddling and massaged my shoulders for a second  before reaching behind me and grabbing my bag, making sure if was  securely fitted to me.</p>
<p>“Alright, we  disembark here since it seems to be the shortest climb.”</p>
<p>Mikoto was the first to  abandon ship, springing from the small vessel and nearly capsizing it  in the process. I followed a little more gracefully, and once Mai had  discarded her white jacket, she too entered the water.</p>
<p>Once we had clambered  up the short rock wall, it didn’t take us long to jog closer to the  abandoned facility.</p>
<p>“What was this  place?” the violet-eyed girl asked.</p>
<p>“One of the branches  of the First District. It’s a research lab for the power to  manipulate higher-order matter.” I paused for a moment to retrieve  a pair of night vision goggles from my bag, and began adjusting them  to my head before I continued, “Listen, the security system is  still active. Follow my footsteps exactly.”</p>
<p>“Got it—Eh!”</p>
<p>Turning, I nearly  smacked myself on the forehead when I saw Mikoto off in the distance,  and thanks to the goggles, the numerous red trip lasers she was  standing right in the middle of.</p>
<p>“Mai, let’s go!”  the girl called out, waving her hand like this was some kind of trip  to an amusement park or something.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long  for the alarms to start blaring.</p>
<p><em>Ah, fuck it. Who  wants to be James Bond anyway?</em></p>
<p>Returning the goggles  to my bag, I motioned Mai onward, Mikoto following us after we had  caught up to her. As I ran, I materialized one of my guns, making  quick work of the chain link fence that blocked our path.</p>
<p>“Even if the alarm  goes off, it will take some time for them to arrive,” I told the  two girls as they pulled open the glass double doors. “Tell me if  you find any documents, computers, or any sort of data disks. We’ll  leave in ten minutes,” I instructed.</p>
<p>“Mmh.”</p>
<p>“Got it,” Mai  replied right before we branched off in different directions.</p>
<p>In a way, I was glad to  have the others with me in this place. Not only would it make the  search that much quicker, but it also meant that I wouldn’t have to  be here alone. Even though we might not all be together right now, I  knew they were close, and for some reason, I found an odd sense of  comfort in that fact.</p>
<p>As I climbed up the  stairs, I already knew where I was headed. It was like I didn’t  even have to think. My feet knew the way on their own, and I let them  take over. As I approached the top, I slowed to a walk, and gazing  through the metal railing that lined the stairs from the hallway, I  could clearly see the door I was looking for.</p>
<p>The nametag looked the  same as I remembered, although it felt a little awkward to be  eye-level with the thing. Had it really been that long since I had  been here? I had only barely surpassed the door handle before, and  now…</p>
<p>I gripped the cold  steel of the handle, my hand lingering before applying the force  needed to open the door, and in doing so, a rush of memories flooded  my mind. Memories…of that last day…</p>
<p align="center"><em>Reaching  up, I pushed the heavy door ajar, peeking inside to be met with my  mothers back and the rapid clicking of her typing on the keyboard of  her computer. The creaking of the door alerted her of my presence,  and she immediately swiveled around in her chair to address her  intruder. When she saw that it was me, her expression softened.</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>Natsuki-chan,  did you come to pick me up? Are you alone?”</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>Nope,  Duran’s here too.”</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>Upon  hearing his name, my companion stuck his head in the door, woofing  his hello to mom.</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>She  chuckled at the sight, “I’m almost finished here. Just give me a  few minutes and then we can go home, okay?”</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>Mmh,  okay.”</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>Mom  smiled again, returning to her computer.</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>I  was wondering where this was! Here, Duran!”</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>Picking  up the yellow wiener dog chew toy off of the center table, I tossed  it at the brown mess of fur beside me, and Duran instantly began  gnawing at the thing. I giggled as I plopped down on the floor beside  him, tugging on the toy that he stubbornly refused to let go of. </em></p>
<p align="center"><em>We  continued our little game of tug-of-war until a startled gasp came  from my mother. The abrupt noise even made Duran jump as he let go of  the toy, causing me to jerk backwards. Mother stood, her rolling  chair slamming into the table behind her. She whipped around and in  an instant was around the center table. Bending at the waist, she  forcefully took a hold of my wrist and yanked me up, causing me to  drop the chew toy in the process.</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>Mommy…?”</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>We  have to go, Natsuki. Duran, come.” </em></p>
<p align="center"><em>It took  me a moment to catch my footing, but when I did we were already out  the door, Duran close behind.</em></p>
<p>That was the last I had  seen of this room, and now here I stood in the entryway, ten years  later, taking it all in for probably the last time.</p>
<p>It wasn’t quite the  way I had remembered it. Mom’s desk with her now wrecked computer  was still in the back right corner and the large square table still  dominated the center of the room. The tall bookshelf that once lined  the right wall had disappeared, and the desk parallel to my mother’s  had been cleaned of the mountain of notebooks that at one time had  hidden its surface. What bothered me the most, however, was that the  whole place looked like it had been turned upside down, as if someone  had been rummaging through the office in search of something…</p>
<p>“Mother…” I  whispered, my gaze falling to the floor.</p>
<p>And that’s when I saw  it. Duran’s chew toy. After all these years it was still here. I  kneeled down and took the small plush in my hand, poking at one of  its awkward little legs, remember all the good times I had playing  with my dog. Inspecting the thing, I could tell that it was still as  disgusting looking as it had been back then, but in closer  observation, I caught a number on the collar. Curious, I turned the  yellow toy over. My smile vanished.</p>
<p><em>There’s  more…What…what is this? A…code…?</em></p>
<p>Had I not noticed this  before? How could I? I was only seven at the time, even if I had seen  if, I would never have thought anything of it. Now that I was  thinking about it, this particular toy did always have a strange  tendency to disappear, hadn’t it? And how had it gotten in mom’s  office? Had I brought it here on a previous visit?</p>
<p>I couldn’t remember. Dammit, I couldn’t remember, and so I did  the only thing I could do; I slipped the small toy into my bag, and  taking one last look around the room, I headed back out the door for  the final time.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
It had only been half  an hour since I had settled myself down in one of the chairs in the  corner of my room and cracked open my new book. It was an older  Yoshimoto Banana novel, <em>Moonlight Shadow</em>, that had been  published quite a while ago, but this would be the first time for me  to read it.
<p>I was just about to  start the fourth chapter when I heard a light knocking on my door. I  stood, setting the book down where I had previously sat before making  my way to the door.</p>
<p>“Reito-san?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t wake you,  did I?”</p>
<p>“No, I was just  reading. What’s the matter? You look worried…”</p>
<p>“Well, you see, I  haven’t seen Mai-san since dinner this evening. I foolishly told  Mikoto-chan of this, and now she is nowhere to be found either…”</p>
<p>“Mmh,” I muttered,  lightly placing a single finger on my chin.</p>
<p><em>Those two again…</em></p>
<p>“It’s getting  pretty dark outside, so I was planning to go out and look for them.  I’ve already informed Sagisawa-sensei and  Sugiura-sensei, and we’re going to drive around the area. Would you  mind coming, too? The more eyes we have, the better chance we have of  locating them.”</p>
<p>“Of course, just let  me grab my jacket.”</p>
<p>After obtaining the  article, Reito and I made our way downstairs where our two superiors  were waiting.</p>
<p>“You guys ready?”  Midori questioned as we approached.</p>
<p>“I think so,” Reito  responded.</p>
<p>Yoko was the next to  speak, “We’ll just take my car if that’s okay with everyone.”</p>
<p>Our little patrol walked outside, and once we had piled into  Sagisawa-sensei’s vehicle, we slowly pulled out of the driveway. No  sooner had we left the Suzushiro residence, I spotted something I  hadn’t expected to see.</p>
<p><em>That’s…</em></p>
<p>“Natsuki?”</p>
<p>Reito turned to me before looking back out the window, “That is her  motorcycle, isn’t it? I didn’t know she was here.”</p>
<p>“Me either…”</p>
<p>“I wonder if she’s with the other two?” Yoko-sensei pondered  out loud.</p>
<p>“Most likely,” Midori replied, the confidence in her tone nagging  at me slightly.</p>
<p>Choosing to remain silent for the time being, the four of us drove  off into the night in search of the three girls.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
As I descended the set  of stairs, I could see that both Mai and Mikoto had already returned  and were waiting for me.
<p>“How was it, Mai?”</p>
<p>“No, luck. Everything  was destroyed,” came the disappointed reply.</p>
<p>Deciding to keep my own  discovery a secret, I pressed on, “Okay, we’re going back.”</p>
<p>No sooner had the words  left my mouth, the younger girl glanced back over her shoulder  towards the entrance, “Someone’s coming.”</p>
<p>After securely  concealing ourselves behind the stairwell, sure enough, I too saw the  dark silhouette of a person standing between the open glass doors,  shining a flashlight to scope the area.</p>
<p>“I know you guys are  there. You’re charged with trespassing…”</p>
<p>“It’s a cop,” Mai  stated the obvious.</p>
<p>I was quick to summon  my element…and Mai was just a hasty to cover it up.</p>
<p>“What are you  thinking about doing with that?!” she harshly whispered, sounding  much like a mother in the process.</p>
<p>“We can’t be  arrested,” I shot back through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“Even so…”</p>
<p>“They’re from the  First District. You saw it too. We can’t be sure if that cop’s  real or not,” I logically argued.</p>
<p>The redhead wasn’t  about to be easily defeated, “But what are you going to do if he is  real?”</p>
<p>“Come out, now!”  the man ordered.</p>
<p>By now even Mikoto was  on the edge of lashing out, but of course Mai took care of that with  just a gentle touch of the hand, “No, Mikoto.”</p>
<p>I watched through wide  eyes as the girl slowly began to walk out from our hiding place and  began to reprimand her, but by then it was already too late.</p>
<p>We  surrendered ourselves silently and peacefully, but I refused to hide  my glares towards the busty redhead beside me. The officer and his  partner, whom he had called over once locating the <em>“disturbance”</em>,  proceeded to inspect my bag, and would have taken a look at Mikoto’s  case if the girl hadn’t started growling at him like a wild animal.  Needless to say, he gave up after that.</p>
<p>After the two law  enforcements had successfully marched us outside and to their  vehicle, one of them opened the back door and ordered us inside.  Mikoto was the first to bound inside, the look on her face one of  pure excitement due to her naivety of the situation. Mai slid into  the middle, and I took the window seat beside her. Once the cop had  closed the door behind us, I promptly crossed my arms with a ‘humph’.</p>
<p>“So, what are you  planning to do?” I asked the girl next to me after we had begun  moving, hoping that the engine would cover my voice for the most  part. “At this rate, we’re going to get criminal records.”</p>
<p>Mai plastered a  sheepish look on her face, “Hopefully we’ll get off easy.”</p>
<p>“How are we going to  get out of <em>this</em> easily?”</p>
<p>“It’s a drive, so  have fun!” Mikoto added a little too cheerily for my current mood.</p>
<p>“No, umm…” the  older girl started, but obviously didn’t know how to explain what  we had gotten ourselves into.</p>
<p>“Seriously,” I  sighed, turning my attention to the scenery flashing by, “This  place is—!”</p>
<p>Suddenly we braked to a  halt, the force of the action jerking my body forward. Peering around  the seat in front of me, I tried to locate what had forced us to stop  so abruptly. All I could really make out was a large, red…Sakomizu!?</p>
<p>The officer on the  passenger’s side didn’t waste any time in leaving the car to  inspect the body lying in the middle of the road, but not too long  after he had shook the man, the cop fell over. I knew what had  happened at once.</p>
<p>“Don’t breathe  until I tell you to.”</p>
<p>Springing to life,  Sakomizu shot a gas-emitting bullet into the car, and the  unsuspecting cop up front was almost immediately lulled into a deep  sleep. The afro-sensei, adorned in a blue libre mask, walked over to  the side of the car and tapped on the window, signaling to us that I  was okay to exit the vehicle. We did so at once, all three of us  taking in the fresh air once we had stepped away from the toxic trap.</p>
<p>I helped Sakomizu place  the two unconscious cops into the back of the patrol vehicle in  silence, but once we had finished, I immediately spoke up.</p>
<p>“That was pretty  sloppy on your part.”</p>
<p>“Please, give me a  break. Everyone is being touchy after that recent incident.”</p>
<p>“Recent incident?”</p>
<p>“It’s a personal  problem,” the man instantly tried to cover.</p>
<p>I knew better, but I  let it slide for now. “Are they ordinary cops?”</p>
<p>“Well, I thought the  security for that place would be sufficiently covered by regular  cops, but when I did some research just in case, I sure panicked.”</p>
<p>“Sakomizu-sensei?”  Mai questioned, talking for the first time since we exited the cop  car.</p>
<p>“N-No, I’m not!”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“Afro,” Mikoto  pointed out.</p>
<p>The man in question was  quick to retreat behind the nearby vehicle, “I have some cleaning  up to do so…”</p>
<p>“Why did you pick  this place?” I interrogated before he could get away.</p>
<p>“It has a great view,  so it’s best for ambushing.”</p>
<p>I smirked, “Liar.”</p>
<p>Our  sensei-turned-savior pulled away, and turning back towards the ocean,  I was consumed in the reliving of that night when my life had  abruptly changed for the worse. It’s amazing how so much was taken  from me so quickly…Not only had my mother and best friend died in  that instant, but so had my innocence. The scar on my wrist ached at  the memory.</p>
<p>“Natsuki?”</p>
<p>“Destroying the First  District. Their plans and the entire organization. That is my reason  for fighting. For that cause, I’ll do anything.”</p>
<p>I faced Mai and was met  with an equally serious gaze. We were both silent, a wave of  understanding seeming to pass between us before it was disrupted by  an odd rumbling noise. The two of us glanced over at the younger girl  standing behind us.</p>
<p>“Mai…” Mikoto  began before contorting her face into an expression of pure misery,  “Hungry.”</p>
<p>Soft laughter erupted  from us both, and I welcomed the change in atmosphere with open arms.</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“How are we getting  home?”</p>
<p>“Mmm…well, we could  summon our Childs…”</p>
<p>The redhead immediately  scowled.</p>
<p>“…Or not…Start  walking, I guess?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it a bit  far?”</p>
<p>I sighed in agitation,  “Well, what do <em>you</em> propose then?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…Maybe we can  flag down a passing car?”</p>
<p>“Who knows how long  that’ll take…”</p>
<p>“I’m sure <em>someone</em> is bound to drive by sooner or later.”</p>
<p>“Fine. But who’s  going to do it?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Flag down the car.”</p>
<p>The girl pondered for a  moment, before shrugging with a nervous grin, “Rock, paper,  scissors?”</p>
<p>“You’re kidding,  right?”</p>
<p>“It’s not like we  have a coin to flip.”</p>
<p>“…Alright, let’s  do it. All three at once.”</p>
<p>“What? Mikoto can’t  do it.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“What if some creep  pulls up?”</p>
<p>“Oh, so it’s okay  if it’s you or me.”</p>
<p>“Well…yeah…I mean  no! I mean…eh…It’ll be safer this way?”</p>
<p>I stared at her for a  moment before giving in, “Fine, let’s get this over with.”</p>
<p>In unison, we counted,  “One, two, three!”</p>
<p>“Ha! I win!” Mai  exclaimed with a pump of her fist.</p>
<p>“Wha?! No way, that  doesn’t count. You waited until you saw what I was doing!”</p>
<p>“Nice try. We did it  at the same time, Natsuki.”</p>
<p><em>Dammit!</em></p>
<p>“Um…Best two out of  three?”</p>
<p>The girl just pointed  towards the road, “Stop being a sore loser and get out there.”</p>
<p>Defeated, I shyly  turned towards the road and peered down its empty lanes.</p>
<p>“Are we really doing  this?”</p>
<p>“You lost at Janken.  No complaints,” Mai reminded me as she leaned back against the  guardrail, Mikoto perched behind her using the busty girl to keep her  balance as she kept a lookout for any upcoming vehicles.</p>
<p>“A car’s coming!”</p>
<p><em>That certainly was  fast…</em></p>
<p>Straightening in  posture, I held out my hand, thumb pointing towards the sky in  classical hitchhiking fashion.</p>
<p>“No, be more sexy,”  Mai protested, “You’re wasting your femininity.”</p>
<p>I twitched at her words  before relentlessly taking her advice.</p>
<p><em>I can do this…I  can do this…God this is so ridiculous!</em></p>
<p>Exposing my derrière  to the open road, I pulled out the sexiest once-in-a-lifetime pose a  Kuga could possibly muster. I even added a sexy voice for added  effect, “Hey, give us a ride.”</p>
<p>To my utter joy, the  car skidded to a quick stop.</p>
<p><em>Score!</em></p>
<p>“All right!” Mai  cheered before realizing who our rescuers had turned out to be.</p>
<p>It was the car from  earlier this evening…I knew it had looked familiar, but this…this  was too much…</p>
<p>“Kuga-san, you’re…”  Sagisawa-sensei mumbled as she stepped out of  the car.</p>
<p>“Nice job!” Midori  cooed from her seat as she halfway hung out the window.</p>
<p>Reito’s childish  laughter was the next to reach my ears, “We came searching for you  three, but…”</p>
<p>“That  sure was worth it,” Shizuru added, taking on her <em>“oh  my”</em> expression.</p>
<p>I snapped to attention  as my face inevitably turned beet red before I sank down onto my  knees and released a cry of dismay.</p>
<p>I sat there motionless  for a moment, lips quivering, my face still on fire, until I felt a  warm hand rest on my shoulder. I turned my eyes up to see Mai peering  down at me.</p>
<p>“Come on  Natsuki…worse things have happened, right?”</p>
<p>I shook my head with a  little whimper as she and Mikoto practically dragged me to my feet  again. Even as we stumbled towards the car, my head still hung in  beyond-embarrassed humiliation.</p>
<p>Once we had all crammed into the car, Reito on the far left side, Mai  in the middle with Mikoto on her lap, followed by Shizuru, and then  myself behind the drivers seat smothered against the door, we took  off back towards the original starting point of our little adventure.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I don’t think I’ve  ever been packed into such a small space in my entire life.
<p>For once, the closeness  of Natsuki and I was something I wasn’t full-heartedly enjoying  since it was more painful than anything else. We were skewed in such  a way that the younger girl’s shoulder was behind my own, half of  her back pressed against the door in an attempt to create more room  for the rest of us, as our legs clashed in the small space behind the  drivers seat. It had certainly been a good idea to shave last night,  I decided.</p>
<p>I halfway glanced over  at my friend who continued to silently and forlornly stare out the  window. I tilted my head so I could whisper into her ear.</p>
<p>“Do you want my  jacket?”</p>
<p>A quiet grunt was my  only reply from the sulking girl who continued to gaze out at the  passing scenery.</p>
<p>My attempt at being  nice having failed, I tried Plan B, “You shouldn’t be so  upset…but Natsuki certainly did look cute like that.”</p>
<p>This time she only  glared at me out of the corner of her eye without a word or a blush.</p>
<p>Strike two. If it  hadn’t been clear before, it was quite obvious now that Natsuki was  indeed quite upset about the whole ordeal. I sighed quietly as I  tried to think of some way to comfort the girl even just a little.</p>
<p>Deciding to risk it, I  softly laid my hand on her thigh, my fingers resting on her knee.  Natsuki immediately snapped her head to look me in the eyes, and I  softened my gaze, a small apologetic smile gracing my features. The  raven-haired girl pushed out a raspy breath, flashing a sincere,  though minuscule, smile at me afterwards before slipping back into  her cold demeanor and returning to her previous activity.</p>
<p>Having received all  that I needed, even if it had come and gone in an instant, I pulled  back and placed my hand in my lap again, leaving Natsuki alone for  the remainder of the ride back to the Suzushiro villa.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the  mansion, everyone hastily dispersed into the house except for one  individual in particular, and I was quick to follow her.</p>
<p>“Natsuki, wait!”</p>
<p>Rather than meeting  emerald orbs, I just continued to see dark tresses. When the girl did  finally stop, it was because she had reached her motorcycle and  hastily begun to slip into her dark grey biker suit.</p>
<p>“Where are you  going?” I tried again.</p>
<p>“Home.”</p>
<p>“Is that such a good  idea? It’s already pretty late…”</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“There are still  plenty of rooms at the villa. You could stay in mine since I have a  room to myself—“</p>
<p>“No thanks, I just  want to get back.”</p>
<p>I watched as Natsuki  leaned against the bike’s sturdy body as she removed her sandals to  trade them with her usual riding boots.</p>
<p>“Can I come with you  then?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>My lack of response  caused her to finally look up at me, “This is supposed to be a  vacation for you, isn’t it? You should enjoy it while it lasts.”</p>
<p><em>I’d enjoy it much  more if you were with me…</em></p>
<p>“I really wish you’d  stay…it would be much safer for you to drive back in the morning.”</p>
<p>“There will be less  people on the road now,” Natsuki contended, straddling her bike  while pulling on her gloves.</p>
<p>Again I didn’t speak,  and after she had taken her helmet into her hands, Natsuki sighed, “I  can handle myself, Shizuru…”</p>
<p>The helmet was secured  on, shielding her face from me in the darkness.</p>
<p>“So don’t worry  about me,” came the muffled conclusion before the silence of the  night was shattered by the bike’s engine roaring to life.</p>
<p><em>Saying that doesn’t  help, you know…</em></p>
<p>As much as I  desperately wanted to call out to Natsuki…to make her stop…to  make her stay here with me, I held my tongue even as I watched her  speed off into the distance.</p>
<p>Closing my eyes, I  opened the mental link with my Child.</p>
<p><em>Kiyohime.</em></p>
<p>It’s a strange  sensation, indirectly communicating with a creature such as my  Kiyohime, for there are no words involved. More or less, it’s like  a wave of feelings, emotions and concepts are being passed back and  forth between our minds. Mental images, as I quickly discovered, were  the key to getting one’s point across.</p>
<p>I could feel the rush  of the Child’s thoughts begin to merge with my own, and I had to  fight to keep them separate, but in that instant, I knew she was  listening.</p>
<p><em>Natsuki.</em></p>
<p>The hydra flashed a  distorted image of my friend into my mind almost immediately. My  Child had been swift in learning who Natsuki was…and what she meant  to me, since every time the girls name was mentioned, the creature  also sent a wave of nearly overwhelming adoration with her image.</p>
<p>At the reply, I  responded with approval.</p>
<p><em>Follow. Protect.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Confusion. Fear?  Danger?</strong></em></p>
<p>After reassuring her  that I, myself, was okay and under no threat, I repeated my order.</p>
<p><em><strong>Compliance.</strong></em></p>
<p>Breaking the connection, I opened my eyes again, and praying that my  request would be enough, I walked back through the gates of the  Suzushiro villa.</p>
