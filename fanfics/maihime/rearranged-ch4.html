The entire day passed and Natsuki had yet to hear from or see Shizuru. 
It was now dark outside and she was beginning to wonder if she would 
even see her today. Maybe her parents had forbade her from leaving their 
house, or maybe the questioning from the police had taken a really long 
time. Either way, Natsuki was becoming more worried with each minute 
that ticked by.

She wanted to see her. No, she needed to see her.

The sound of footsteps running up the stairs of her apartment building 
alerted her. She waited, holding her breath, to see if they belonged to 
the person she hoped they belonged to.

Knock Knock

It was her. She was finally there. Suddenly the anticipation that had 
been building all day as she&#39;d waited for this moment to come began to 
well up inside her so that she felt she might burst. Going to the door, 
she opened it with as much calm as she could muster.

Natsuki barely glimpsed the look of joy and relief on Shizuru&#39;s face 
before she was nearly knocked over by her embrace. Shizuru&#39;s arms were 
wrapped tightly about her, and her face was buried into her hair. 
Natsuki returned the hug just as tightly, relishing in the scent and 
feel of the girl she&#39;d been longing to see for what seemed like an 
eternity.

The feel of the cold night air brought Natsuki back to her senses; and 
without relinquishing her hold on the other girl, she leaned forward and 
closed the door, locking it. She then pulled back slightly to gaze upon 
Shizuru&#39;s face. Light bruising was evident around her jaw, and her lips 
were slightly bruised as well. Her eyes were also puffy from the 
shedding of countless tears. Anger and concern flared up in Natsuki&#39;s 
chest at the sight. She raised her hand and trailed her fingertips over 
the other girl&#39;s face in the gentlest of touches.

&quot;How could he do this to you?&quot; Natsuki whispered in disbelief.

Shizuru grabbed her hand, holding it to her face. Their eyes met, and 
the need each of them felt became almost tangible.

&quot;Let me get your coat for you,&quot; Natsuki said, swallowing the lump that 
had risen in her throat.

Shizuru shrugged it off and handed it too her and Natsuki hung it on the 
coat rack as she removed her shoes. That taken care of, Natsuki held her 
hand out to Shizuru and pulled the girl to her once more. She leaned in 
to give Shizuru a kiss, but then hesitated, wanting first to drink in 
the sight of the other girl&#39;s closed eyes and parted lips. Just as 
Shizuru was opening her eyes to see what was taking so long, Natsuki 
leaned in and captured her lips.

Finally. That was the thought in each of their minds as they slowly 
kissed one another. Natsuki was gentle, massaging the other girl&#39;s lips 
in the most tender kiss they&#39;d ever shared. Shizuru&#39;s heart melted at 
the love and care that Natsuki was showing her, and she lost herself 
completely in the amazing kiss.

After several minutes they pulled away, breathless. Natsuki noticed her 
hands had found their way under Shizuru&#39;s top and were rubbing and 
caressing the skin at her waist. She smiled and leaned down, nuzzling 
Shizuru&#39;s neck before placing kisses up and down the smooth column of 
her throat. The other girl leaned her head back, letting out a moan of 
pleasure at the loving attention.

&quot;Natsuki,&quot; she panted, her cheeks flushed, &quot;take me to bed.&quot;

Not needing to be asked twice, Natsuki grabbed her hand and led her back 
to her bedroom. There was no point in being discrete with one another; 
each knew this was what the other had been wanting all day as they had 
waited for the time when they would see each other again.

Once inside her room, Natsuki turned to Shizuru and slid her hands under 
the girl&#39;s shirt, lifting it over her head. She then yanked her own 
shirt over her head, causing Shizuru to giggle at her mussed hair. 
Grinning, Natsuki brought herself closer to Shizuru and lightly ran her 
fingers over her collarbone, across the tops of her breasts, and down 
her stomach to the button of the girl&#39;s corduroy pants. She flicked it 
open and let down the zipper, then pushed the pants down and helped 
Shizuru step out of them.

She stepped back to look at Shizuru&#39;s underwear-clad form, marveling at 
her friend&#39;s sexiness. Her eyes&#39; exploration halted when she noticed the 
bruising on Shizuru&#39;s arms. That guy must&#39;ve had a pretty hard grip on 
her, Natsuki observed, because the bruises were fairly dark. She brought 
herself close to Shizuru and gingerly lifted one of her arms.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry Shizuru,&quot; she whispered as she lightly kissed the bruises, 
&quot;I should&#39;ve gotten there sooner, I should&#39;ve stopped him before he 
could hurt you.&quot;

&quot;Natsuki, no, it&#39;s not your fault. Please don&#39;t place any blame on 
yourself. Besides, if it wasn&#39;t for you who knows what he would have...&quot; 
Shizuru stopped herself, unable to voice the awfulness that might have 
transpired. They clung to each other, fighting back the tears that were 
threatening to fall.

&quot;Let&#39;s not think about that anymore tonight; I just want to be with 
you,&quot; Shizuru said.

Natsuki nodded, her body already starting to react to the feel of 
Shizuru&#39;s skin touching hers. She slid her hands up Shizuru&#39;s back, 
eliciting a shiver from the taller girl, and then undid the clasp of her 
bra. Letting her fingernails lightly scrape across Shizuru&#39;s shoulders, 
she brought the straps of her bra down her arms and let it fall to the 
floor.

&quot;So beautiful,&quot; she murmured as she kissed her way down to Shizuru&#39;s 
breasts. After giving them ample attention and receiving many satisfied 
moans from Shizuru, Natsuki felt her head being pulled up.

&quot;It&#39;s my turn,&quot; said Shizuru as she pushed Natsuki backwards towards the 
bed until the backs of her legs hit the mattress. Losing her balance, 
she fell onto her back and was immediately pounced on by Shizuru. Her 
jeans were quickly undone and she lifted her hips so Shizuru could slide 
them off. With that taken care of, Shizuru crawled up Natsuki&#39;s body so 
that they were face-to-face and initiated a passionate kiss. Their 
tongues battled for supremacy, Shizuru eventually winning out as she let 
her body lay across Natsuki&#39;s, pushing her down into the mattress.

When they broke apart, Shizuru sat up, straddling Natsuki&#39;s hips. She 
lovingly caressed Natsuki&#39;s cheek with her hand and then moved it down 
to deftly undo the front clasp on her bra. An appreciative smirk curled 
her lips as she skillfully fondled and teased the girl&#39;s lovely bosom. 
Unable to resist, she leaned down and kissed Natsuki&#39;s breasts, letting 
her tongue lave over her nipples until the other girl was squirming and 
panting at the sensations.

Moving down Natsuki&#39;s body, Shizuru reached her panties and her heart 
beat faster as she hovered over this unexplored territory. She lightly 
stroked the center of her dampened panties, watching as Natsuki&#39;s thighs 
trembled at the contact. Hooking her fingers on the sides, she pulled 
down the undergarment and tossed it over her shoulder to join the rest 
of their clothes on the floor.

Natsuki opened her eyes and looked down just in time to see Shizuru 
lower her face to her aching center. At the first touch of Shizuru&#39;s 
tongue, Natsuki&#39;s mind blanked and she let out a breathy moan of 
pleasure. And just when she thought nothing could possibly feel better, 
Shizuru inserted two fingers and began stroking her while sucking on her 
most sensitive area. The feel of Shizuru&#39;s ministrations, combined with 
the sight of her touching her in the most intimate of ways, brought 
Natsuki to her first orgasm. Her body shuddered as wave after wave of 
ecstasy coursed through her, her hips instinctively thrusting into 
Shizuru&#39;s palm.

Shizuru watched as she went over the edge, her fingers continuing their 
assault until Natsuki&#39;s walls finished pulsing around her. She withdrew 
her hand and moved up to hold Natsuki in her arms, loving the sound of 
Natsuki&#39;s labored breathing and the sight of her flushed face. Unable to 
speak, Natsuki pressed herself further into Shizuru&#39;s embrace, the 
curves of their bodies melting together. They stayed that way for a few 
minutes, until Natsuki calmed down and was finally able to lift her head 
to look at the face of her lover.

&quot;Shizuru...that was...I...,&quot; she fumbled for the words to express how 
amazing the experience had been for her.

&quot;Shhh,&quot; Shizuru pressed a finger to her lips, &quot;Just kiss me.&quot;

Natsuki needed no further encouragement as she leaned in and sealed her 
mouth against Shizuru&#39;s. Natsuki could taste her desire in Shizuru&#39;s 
mouth as their tongues twisted together and it fueled her excitement. 
She pulled her head from the kiss, their lips making a slight &#39;pop&#39; as 
they separated.

&quot;Shizuru,&quot; she breathed, &quot;let me make love to you.&quot;

&quot;Yes, please,&quot; Shizuru choked out, wanting nothing more than the younger 
girl&#39;s hands and mouth on her.

Natsuki moved on top of her and began gently sucking and nibbling on 
Shizuru&#39;s earlobe, smiling as she felt the other girl&#39;s body writhe 
beneath her. She then moved down to her chest, once more tasting the 
sweet flesh of her breasts while trailing her right hand down to the 
soft patch of curls between Shizuru&#39;s legs. She lightly stroked her 
womanhood, not exactly sure if she was doing it correctly. Shizuru 
seemed to approve however, if the pleased noises she was emitting were 
any indication. Wanting more, she moved to the apex of Shizuru&#39;s thighs 
and removed her panties. Feeling the wetness there with her fingers, she 
brought them to her lips and tasted Shizuru&#39;s desire, surprised at the 
sweetness she detected.

Natsuki then went to work, delving her tongue into Shizuru&#39;s folds while 
stroking her with her fingers. She felt Shizuru thread her fingers 
through her hair, pulling her closer as she rocked against her mouth. It 
wasn&#39;t long before she felt Shizuru tense, screaming out her name as she 
reached her release, her body jerking with the force of her orgasm.

Resting her head against Shizuru&#39;s leg, Natsuki smiled with satisfaction 
at bringing the other girl to her climax. She felt Shizuru pulling at 
her, so she moved over her, kissing her deeply and thoroughly before 
lowering herself to rest against the taller girl&#39;s body. They stayed 
like that for some time, feeling each other&#39;s hearts beating and 
listening to each other breathe. Eventually, Natsuki rolled off to 
Shizuru&#39;s side, taking the other girl&#39;s hand and lacing their fingers 
together.

They lay there, looking at each other, in post-coital bliss. Their eyes 
held a mixture of love, wonderment, and contentedness.

&quot;I love you,&quot; Natsuki said, giving Shizuru&#39;s hand a squeeze.

&quot;I love you too,&quot; Shizuru replied.

Natsuki found it was becoming impossible to keep her eyes open, so she 
reached down and pulled the covers up over them. Cuddling close 
together, they shared a final kiss before falling into a deep sleep.</pre>
