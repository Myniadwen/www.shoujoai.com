<h1>A Mai HiME Fiction: Loose Threads (part 5 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/arcajeth.html">Arca Jeth</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/loosethreads-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Education held little interest for Minagi Mikoto. Granted, she knew she 
needed to pass classes and get good grades, but the minutia of school 
life was boring for her. When the day wore on and the history teacher 
droned on about the price of rice in the Meiji Era, the feral girl&#39;s 
mind wandered. 

She hadn&#39;t wandered far when she met the cool, green gaze of her 
classmate, Yuuki Nao. The redhead was looking up from her cell phone 
where she was doubtlessly sending a message to a male acquaintance. 
Mikoto watched Nao&#39;s mouth form a devilish smile. 

So...she has a date for tonight. Mikoto thought with a small pang. 
Whether it was from loss or jealousy, she didn&#39;t know. Nor did she wish 
to know. Minagi Mikoto didn&#39;t like to dwell on her relationship with 
Nao. She&#39;d come to her sometimes and Nao would touch her. Sometimes it 
made her body feel good, but it did little else.

Though their encounters would begin with no small amount of pain, 
afterwards Nao could be gentle, sometimes even tender towards Mikoto. 
However, those moments were short-lived at best. Nao would adopt a 
disgusted look and order Mikoto to go home. 

&quot;It&#39;s better this way,&quot; Mikoto mused. 

She didn&#39;t have to worry about loving Nao. She wasn&#39;t even sure she 
*liked* Nao. But even if what they did together was too raw, too 
animalistic to be called lovemaking, the afterwards was worth it. The 
tender afterwards was even better than the during. It almost made up 
for the fact that she couldn&#39;t love Nao. It almost made up for the 
fact that Nao would never be Mai.

Mikoto felt her cell phone buzz. She surreptitiously opened the cover 
to find the message:

&quot;STUDY HALL. GIRL&#39;S GYM.&quot;

Mikoto looked back to find her read-haired classmate giving her a 
mirthless smile. She shivered at the thought of what Nao had in store 
for her this time. But the afterwards....

Minagi Mikoto could endure a little pain for that.
