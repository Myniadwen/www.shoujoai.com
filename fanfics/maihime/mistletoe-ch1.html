<h1>Mistletoe</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leebot.html">Leebot</a><br> </h2>
<p>“Welcome, and merry Christmas...” Shizuru said cheerfully as she opened up the door to 
Mai's 
dormroom. She'd been recruited to help with the preparations for Mai's Christmas party, and 
apparently she was now playing greeter. “Ara, Natsuki!”</p><p>Shizuru was the perfect image 
of Christmas cheer when she opened up the door, from her lovely smile to her Mrs. Claus 
costume that was far too sexy for its own good. Not that Natsuki minded the sight, of 
course, she just didn't want other people to be ogling Shizuru. She let it pass though, as 
the only other girls at this party who might be interested were Yukino and Haruka, but they 
were involved with each other, so there was really no worry there. Granted, there were also 
rumors about Mai and Mikoto, but Natsuki didn't buy into them, personally.</p><p>Natsuki 
didn't have much time to think about her worries, though, as she quickly noticed the change 
in Shizuru's demeanor, who became even more cheerful, if that was possible. It had happened 
right on the note of her “Ara,” when she noticed that it was Natsuki at the door. Her eyes 
went from sweet and graceful to gleeful and loving, and her smile widened, breaking through 
her mask to show her genuine pleasure at Natsuki's presence. It wasn't just that Natsuki had 
showed up late; Shizuru was always like this upon seeing her, and it never failed to tug at 
Natsuki's heart.</p><p>Natsuki smiled back, though she quickly suppressed the smile when it 
occurred to her that others were already inside and could probably see her. She had an image 
to keep up, after all. Looking past Shizuru, she confirmed that most of the group was 
already there, which included the original HiME-sentai, plus Shizuru, Haruka, Chie, and Aoi 
as new additions to the group. Midori was of course still off in the Middle East, so she 
couldn't attend, and although Mai and Mikoto were nowhere to be seen, Natsuki was sure they 
were simply off in the kitchen working on dinner.</p><p>Ignoring Chie's gestured request for 
her to smile for her camera, Natsuki slipped in through the door. “Hey Shizuru. I'm here, as 
promised.” <i>You owe me later.</i></p><p>Shizuru laughed gently and then smiled at her 
girlfriend. “I never doubted Natsuki for a moment,” she said as she took Natsuki's jacket 
and placed it in the closet. Natsuki started to move past her into the main room, but a hand 
on her shoulder stopped her. “Ara ara, I'm afraid Natsuki can't do that quite 
yet.”</p><p>“Huh?” Natsuki turned around, eying Shizuru suspiciously. She recognized that 
tone of voice; Shizuru was in a teasing mood. She'd learned from experience that it was best 
to just get it over with, for both her and Shizuru. “Why's that?”</p><p>“Did Natsuki not 
notice?” Shizuru said, giving an impish smile. Her eyes rolled upwards, and then back to 
Natsuki. “We're both standing under the mistletoe right now...”</p><p>Natsuki's eyes snapped 
upwards, and her blush was immediate. She tried to shake her head to get rid of it, but 
Shizuru's expression just made it impossible. “Shizuru!” she snapped out, glaring at her 
girlfriend. She couldn't say the words out loud for fear of embarrassment, but she tried to 
get the message across to Shizuru that yes, she loved her, but she couldn't start kissing 
her in front of all their friends like this. She just wouldn't be able to trust herself to 
keep her cool and not go into “girlfriend mode” in front of everyone. She'd said as much to 
Shizuru before, surely she could understand?</p><p>The twinkle in Shizuru's eye told Natsuki 
that she did indeed understand, and that was in fact the heart of the tease. “Does Natsuki 
not have any Christmas spirit? Or perhaps she just hates me so much she couldn't bear to 
kiss me...” Shizuru gave her best sniffle as she said this, and her eyes actually started to 
water up.</p><p>Natsuki knew this was an act. It was one of the few times she was sure. That 
didn't make things any easier on her, though. She couldn't appear mean to Shizuru in front 
of everyone, so she was forced to play along. “Come on, Shizuru. You know I don't hate 
you... or dislike you even.”</p><p>Shizuru put on a huge pout now. “Then it must be that 
Natsuki doesn't have any Christmas spirit. If that's the case, then I just can't let her 
into this party!”</p><p>Natsuki growled and glared at Shizuru again. She mouthed through 
clenched teeth, “Why are you doing this to me?” even though she had a pretty good guess as 
to the answer. Shizuru did love to torment her sometimes. She just wished it didn't have to 
be in front of everyone else this one time.</p><p>“Give it up already, Kuga,” Nao's voice 
came from Natsuki's left. She turned to see the red-haired girl leaning back on the sofa, 
sipping a drink. “We all went through this. You can't win. Just give her a peck on the cheek 
and be done with it. Or are you afraid you'll enjoy it too much and jump your dyke lover 
right there?”</p><p>Natsuki's mood dropped in an instant. “What did you just call Shizuru?” 
she demanded. The glare she gave Nao was no joke this time. She fully intended to murder 
that girl – whether they were supposedly friends now or not – if she didn't take back that 
comment.</p><p>To the relief of everyone in the room who didn't want the Christmas party to 
turn into a crime scene, Nao proved that she didn't lack common sense. She cowered back into 
her seat and said, “Er, uh, 'bike lover,' I meant. 'bike-lover lover,' 
even.”</p><p>Natsuki's anger didn't completely fade at that, but she caught the glare Haruka 
was giving Nao. Ever since her snap conversion during the summer, Haruka had taken up the 
cause of gay rights with a passion that no one on Earth could rival. It seemed that even if 
Natsuki wasn't going to attack Nao for her comment, Haruka still might. Of course, she'd 
claim it was because she was against the use of the term “dyke” on principle rather than 
defending her friend, but the result was the same.</p><p>There was nothing Natsuki could do 
about that, though. Probably best to hope Haruka cooled off a bit before she got Nao alone, 
so that she wouldn't hurt the girl too badly. In the meantime, Natsuki found herself having 
to dodge a pair of incoming lips from her overly-amorous girlfriend. “Oi!”</p><p>Shizuru 
pouted audibly as her attack was dodged. “Ikezu! Natsuki neither likes me nor has any 
Christmas spirit!”</p><p>“Gah!” Natsuki growled and gritted her teeth. This was really 
getting out of hand. At this point, Shizuru wouldn't be satisfied with just a kiss on the 
cheek. She was probably hoping to catch Natsuki in a real kiss now and make her melt in 
front of all her friends, mortifying her once she was thinking straight enough again to 
realize what had happened. And that would give Shizuru the perfect excuse to “make it up” to 
Natsuki when they got home. Truly, the woman could be evil when she wanted to.</p><p>And 
Natsuki loved her for it. She could be the most infuriating person on Earth, but it just 
made her so endearing, and it spoke volumes for her love. Natsuki let her eyes drift back 
over to Shizuru. She was really cute, too, when she pouted like that, pleading for a kiss. 
Her eyes sparkled as she noticed that Natsuki seemed to be weakening, but her face stayed in 
that perfect, adorable pout.</p><p><i>Fine then. Shizuru wants a kiss, she'll get it. But 
it'll be on my own terms.</i></p><p>Natsuki glanced at the room, noticing that despite the 
simmering hostility between Haruka and Nao, she still held most of the attention of their 
friends. It would do. It was about time Shizuru knew what it was like to be embarrassed in 
public anyways.</p><p>Natsuki turned back to Shizuru with a fire in her eyes that caught her 
girlfriend off-guard. It was just the opening she needed. Taking a step forward, she placed 
her hands on Shizuru's shoulders and pushed her love back against the wall. She caught the 
shock in Shizuru's eyes and met it with confidence in her own. Before Shizuru had a chance 
to react any further, Natsuki pressed her body up against hers and leaned in to capture 
Shizuru's lips in a kiss.</p><p>Shizuru slowly melted as Natsuki kissed her slowly, 
lovingly, displaying affection she'd never before let out in front of others. Natsuki knew 
perfectly just how to make Shizuru melt. It wasn't any specific physical act, but simply her 
love. Even after this many months together, the fact that Natsuki truly loved her still 
touched Shizuru's heart. She always loved the utter sweetness Natsuki could show to her with 
just a few simple motions in the kiss that told Shizuru she was really feeling it, and she 
was really loving her.</p><p>Shizuru had to wrap her arms around Natsuki's back to hold 
herself up. She weakly tried to kiss back, but it was all she could do to simply respond to 
the motions of Natsuki's lips, and soon Natsuki's intruding tongue as well. She quickly 
surrendered to her lover, seeming to forget all about their current situation and what 
exactly had brought this kiss on.</p><p>Natsuki nearly forgot herself, she was enjoying this 
so much. It wasn't until she'd brought her hand up to cup Shizuru's breast that it occurred 
to her that something like that might be a bit inappropriate in front of others. Fortunately 
though, it was her right hand, which was out of sight from the rest of the room, so she 
didn't have to worry. She kept it on, gently massaging the breast, sending Shizuru even 
further into a sensuous haze.</p><p>Eventually, it got to the point where Natsuki felt it 
would just be cruel to let Shizuru go if she aroused her lover any further. Silently 
apologizing, even though she knew Shizuru deserved this punishment, Natsuki suddenly ended 
the kiss and pulled back from Shizuru. Just as her lover started to collapse, she reached 
her hands out to catch her, at least sparing her the indignity of collapsing to the floor. 
Still, Shizuru was left with a beet-red face as she tried to blink off the haze Natsuki had 
sent her into.</p><p>“Merry Christmas, Shizuru,” Natsuki said, smiling down at Shizuru. To 
her surprise, she actually received a weak smile back, even as Shizuru's blush 
deepened.</p><p>Natsuki took a moment to gauge the reactions of the rest of the room. 
Unsurprisingly, most were simply staring with their mouths agape. She caught Aoi slapping 
Nao's shoulder and saying, “Now even you have to admit that was hot.” Nao shook herself out 
of her stun at this and grunted in reply.</p><p>“No!” Chie's cry caught the attention of the 
room, pulling gazes away from Natsuki and Shizuru. She pressed her hands to her head, 
clawing at her hair. “I can't believe I didn't take a picture of that! I could have made 
millions!”</p><p>The tension in the room was broken as the other girls couldn't help but let 
out a laugh at Chie's expense. Aoi tried to console her friend, telling her that it was 
understandable she'd be too distracted to think of taking a picture, and then murmuring 
something that made Chie blush but which Natsuki couldn't quite make out. It sounded like 
she was saying something like, “And how come you never kiss me like that in public?” but 
Natsuki discarded that possibility. Their group was already pushing the bounds of 
probability for the number of lesbians among them. Chie and Aoi just had to simply be 
friends. Natsuki couldn't believe otherwise, even if Chie did just start to kiss Aoi like 
that to prove a point.</p><p><i>Okay, maybe I was wrong.</i></p><p>“Food's ready!” Mai 
called out from the doorway to the kitchen. After a moment of stunned gazing at Chie, who 
currently had Aoi pinned down to the floor, she said, “What the...? Great. As if Mikoto 
needed more ideas...”</p><p>After a brief respite for dinner, during which the worst that 
happened was Shizuru's hand wandering down to Natsuki's rear and remaining there for much of 
the meal, the floodgates were opened. Shizuru glued herself to Natsuki, nibbling on her 
love's neck, rubbing her hands over her body, pretty much any form of affection she could 
get away with showing while Natsuki slowly turned purple from the embarrassment of having a 
Kaichou stuck to her like this.</p><p>But if anything, others in the room just envied her 
position. It wasn't long before Nao had to run out from the rampant coupling going on around 
her, claiming there was someone she needed to see and completely baffling the rest of the 
room. Natsuki took this as her cue to leave as well, as her girlfriend was currently the 
most amorous and it seemed that there was only one possible way to satisfy her – a way which 
certainly wasn't going to happen with anyone else in the room.</p><p>Natsuki half-carried, 
half-dragged her lover out of the dormroom, waving fleeting goodbyes to those of her friends 
who had noticed her departure. The second the door closed behind her, Shizuru jumped to her 
feet and pulled Natsuki in a dash outside, to where her bike was parked. “Wha- Hey!” Natsuki 
protested. “What happened? One moment you can't stop yourself from kissing me, the next 
you're fine?”</p><p>Shizuru didn't stop until they reached Natsuki's bike, only then taking 
a chance to explain, while she took out her helmet and hopped onto the seat. “Ara, I do 
think I've punished Natsuki quite enough. It's about time the two of us get home so we can 
both properly apologize.”</p><p>“<i>Punished...?”</i> It took a bit, but things finally 
clicked in Natsuki's mind. “Shizuru!”</p><p>“Ara.” Shizuru smiled and leaned down to give 
Natsuki a quick kiss on the nose. “Merry Christmas, Natsuki.”</p>
