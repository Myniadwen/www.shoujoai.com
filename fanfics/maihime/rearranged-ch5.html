Shizuru&#39;s eyes fluttered open. It was still dark outside and the room 
was bathed only in moonlight. She blinked several times, taking in her 
surroundings and noticed she wasn&#39;t in her own room. Turning to the 
side, she saw the smooth, bare skin of Natsuki&#39;s back and the events of 
the previous evening came flooding back to her instantaneously. Warmth 
engulfed her body as she recalled all that had taken place last night. 
She could feel a blush heat up her face and then a ripple of excitement 
pass through her as the reality of what had happened made its impact in 
her mind.

Propping her head up on one hand, she let her eyes roam freely over 
Natsuki&#39;s form. Her dark hair was spread across her pillow practically 
begging for Shizuru to run her hands through it. Resisting the urge, she 
let her gaze continue down the girl&#39;s delicate neck to the delicious 
curve of her shoulder, and down to her slender waist. The bed sheet 
halted any further exploration as it covered the rest of her body, but 
Shizuru knew well the loveliness that was hidden beneath it.

She wanted to reach out and touch the sleeping girl, to run her hands 
over the stretches of skin that her eyes were currently feasting on, but 
she didn&#39;t want to disturb her companion&#39;s peaceful slumber. That 
thought was foregone when she noticed Natsuki&#39;s body shiver from the 
slight chill in the apartment, and a wave of goosebumps spread down her 
arms. Without pause, Shizuru moved close to her and wrapped her right 
arm around her while pressing herself into Natsuki&#39;s back. The other 
girl&#39;s skin was indeed slightly cool from being exposed, so Shizuru 
pulled the sheet and comforter up over the two of them.

Natsuki stirred very slightly, but did not awake. Smiling mischievously, 
Shizuru buried her face in the girl&#39;s hair, breathing in the scent she&#39;d 
come to crave. She let her right hand run down Natsuki&#39;s side to her 
hip, lightly caressing it. Then sliding it across her abdomen, she let 
her fingers just barely brush the top of her curls before bringing it 
back up and cupping one of the other girl&#39;s breasts. She lightly 
massaged it and began to kiss along Natsuki&#39;s neck, stopping at the 
curve where it met her shoulder to suck and lick at the tender flesh.

It wasn&#39;t long before Natsuki awoke, the pleasurable ministrations 
already causing the heat to pool between her legs. She heard Shizuru 
call her name and answered in kind while arching her back, pushing her 
breast further into the other girl&#39;s palm. Natsuki wanted more, but was 
a bit embarrassed to ask for it, so she let out a whimper of 
frustration. Shizuru knew exactly what she wanted, moving her left arm 
underneath the other girl&#39;s body to encircle her. Her left hand took 
over the fondling of Natsuki&#39;s breasts while her right hand moved down 
to the juncture between her thighs. The wetness she felt there brought a 
smile of smug satisfaction to her face.

Natsuki came quickly under the sure strokes of Shizuru&#39;s hand and the 
breathy words whispered in her ear. And when she had recovered she 
turned around and flipped Shizuru onto her back, returning the favor in 
full.

                          *****************

The sunlight had been streaming in through the blinds for some time when 
they finally roused themselves from their languorous state. Throwing on 
underwear and t-shirts, they went out to the kitchen and poured bowls of 
cereal. They couldn&#39;t keep their hands off one another, which slowed 
down the process considerably and resulted in some spilled milk. After 
breakfast they flopped down onto the couch, laughing at the smiles that 
seemed to be permanently affixed on their faces. When Natsuki looked 
into Shizuru&#39;s crimson eyes, all she could see was joy and unconditional 
love swirling in their depths and it amazed her. She knew that those 
emotions were reflected in her own eyes as well.

Seeing Shizuru smiling so happily made everything seem right with the 
world again. She deserved to have some happiness after the horror she 
had just been through. The recollection of those events was a sobering 
thought for Natsuki, and Shizuru noticed her change in demeanor.

&quot;Natsuki, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Ah...nothing, don&#39;t worry about it, it&#39;s really nothing.&quot;

&quot;Listen, if it&#39;s about yesterday, don&#39;t worry about me. It all just 
seems like a bad dream now, and it&#39;s all thanks to you that I&#39;ve been 
able to get past it.&quot;

&quot;All I can say is that guy better pay for what he did or I&#39;ll take care 
of him myself.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure you would, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have to worry about that; 
the charges against him are pretty serious.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, I&#39;m glad the marriage is off. What are your parents going 
to do now? Wait, they aren&#39;t going to arrange another marriage for you 
are they?&quot;

&quot;We only talked for a short time before I came over here, but they seem 
to think that arranged marriages maybe aren&#39;t the best idea anymore. I&#39;m 
sure they still want me to get married, however, and I&#39;m also sure 
they&#39;re expecting that marriage to be with a man.&quot;

Natsuki looked slightly crestfallen, &quot;You aren&#39;t going to go along with 
their wishes, right? I mean, I know that it&#39;s impossible for you to 
marry me, but that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll marry a man for appearances&#39; 
sake, does it?&quot;

&quot;Natsuki, do you really think I would do that? I&#39;ll tell you now that I 
would give up my position as heir to Fujino Enterprises and run away 
with you to wherever we had to if it meant that was the only way I could 
be with you. Hopefully that won&#39;t be the case, but you have to know that 
I would do that, would do anything, so that I could be by your side.&quot;

Embarrassed, Natsuki turned her head aside and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry if I 
doubted you Shizuru. And thank you, for letting me mean so much to you.&quot;

Smiling gently and taking the younger girl into her arms, Shizuru 
replied, &quot;Please don&#39;t thank me for that. If anything, I should be 
thanking you for everything we&#39;ve shared. Every time I look at you I can 
hardly believe this isn&#39;t a dream that I&#39;m going to wake from at any 
moment.&quot;

&quot;Shizuru...I love you, and...I would do anything for you, too.&quot;

&quot;Oh Natsuki, I love you too.&quot;

They stayed in each other&#39;s embrace for a while before separating to 
continue their conversation.

&quot;So, Natsuki, I was thinking it might be a good idea for you to come 
over to my house sometime...maybe meet my parents?&quot;

&quot;Uhhhh, really? I can&#39;t say that I wouldn&#39;t be extremely nervous about 
doing that. I mean, I wouldn&#39;t want to make a bad impression or 
anything; I&#39;m not exactly skilled in polite social interaction.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it so much, it would be fine. Besides, they&#39;re 
already indebted to you for saving me yesterday.&quot;

&quot;Alright, I guess I really should meet them since you come over here so 
often. They&#39;re probably wondering who I am.&quot;

Shizuru clapped her hands together, &quot;Well then it&#39;s settled. I&#39;ll talk 
to them today and arrange a day when you can come over and we can all 
have dinner together. Thank you Natsuki!&quot;

She then clobbered the other girl, peppering her face with kisses as she 
poked and tickled her stomach. They winded up laying across the couch as 
Natsuki was finally able to halt her assault and grab her hands, pinning 
them above her head. This made for an interesting, if not arousing, 
position.

It was late afternoon when Shizuru was finally able to summon the 
willpower to return home.
