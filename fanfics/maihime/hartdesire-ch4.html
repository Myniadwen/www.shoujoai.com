<h1>Heart's Desire (part 4 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/marashapeshifter.html">marashapeshifter</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/hartdesire-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>The school year began and I assumed the role of Student Council 
president.

I impulsively entered myself as a candidate last year when Natsuki 
needed classified information about the school. It&#39;s a bit embarrassing 
but I won by a landslide.

Being the president wasn&#39;t that heavy a burden. The legwork was done by 
the Executive Committee, under Haruka. As president I mostly saw to it 
that all the work was done by the right people.

Delegation. Supervising. Meeting with school officials. It kept me busy.

But what about the necklace, you ask? What happened to the creepy 
necklace?

Ah yes, I was just getting to that.

I... I am ashamed to admit that I did not destroy it when I had the 
chance. I don&#39;t know why, I don&#39;t know what hope I clung to that made me 
reluctant to destroy it.

Or maybe it influenced me somehow... I prefer to think of it that way.

When I woke with the necklace in my hands, I tried to throw it away 
again.

It didn&#39;t work.

The director was less than forthcoming about the necklace. She insisted 
it was just a gift, and nothing more. I didn&#39;t believe her.

After a few more attempts to get rid of the necklace, I found it behaved 
when I kept it in my pocket or elsewhere on my clothing.

Even when I tossed it away with the rest of the laundry, it still 
appeared in the next day&#39;s school uniform. At least that was better than 
waking up with it entwined in my hands.

I still dreamt though. My head would touch the pillow then I would open 
my eyes and find Natsuki beside me in the bed.

We would talk, or make love, or spend the night just holding each other. 
But when the sun began to peek above the horizon, Natsuki would vanish, 
the dream would end, and I would wake.

Sometimes I would wake with a peaceful feeling, having spent the night 
in her arms.

But more often I would wake feeling empty and hollow inside, where 
Natsuki had been in my dreams. My bed would seem so lonely. There would 
be a pain in my chest and an ache in my stomach and I would curse the 
dreams bitterly.

They gave me a taste of what I would never have, a taste of the 
forbidden fruit.

On one hand I was ecstatic to experience with Natsuki something I would 
never know in real life. On the other hand, how can you have something 
in your dreams and not desire it when you wake?

I wanted it, heaven help me, I wanted it. But I refused to let a hint of 
it escape my tightly controlled mask. My dreams were a private matter, 
Natsuki didn&#39;t really need to know about them.

I never told her about those dreams, not even after the Festival, not 
even after we got married.

How would I say it? &quot;You know honey, I used to have these really erotic 
dreams about you.&quot; Then stand back and watch her burst into fits of 
blushing.

What&#39;s funny is that Natsuki might think I was just teasing her.

I did tease her often, but I knew my boundaries. I knew when getting an 
inch closer meant the difference between her feeling uncomfortable, and 
her feeling threatened. I knew when I could tease her and when she was 
in a bad mood.

I just wish I knew myself as well as I knew her.

-o-

The old crones were true to their word. There were no further attempts 
on Natsuki&#39;s life. That was a great relief.

Natsuki already had a lot do deal with, what with all the orphans 
attacking our school. I was pleased that she made friends with the other
HiMEs.

She and the other HiMEs did an excellent job. There were a few times I 
had to step in and destroy a few orphans that escaped their attention 
but all in all, they did a good job.

I was a bit grateful to the panty stealing orphan though. Most of 
Natsuki&#39;s lingerie collection was destroyed in that incident so I had 
to help her shop for more. That was delightful.

Aside from those shopping trips, she also spent some time with me in 
the Student Council room. She&#39;d leave when the rest of the Student 
Council entered but when it was just me, she&#39;d be in and out of the
room.

She freely used my higher security clearance as the president. She was 
welcome to it. That, at least, was a way I could help her that didn&#39;t 
need to be kept secret.

I thought of telling her, part of the truth at least. Tell her I was 
also a HiME, that I could fight by her side.

There was one time I&#39;d half made up my mind to tell her. She&#39;d gone to 
school that day because one of her subjects had a test.

That was her policy, even if her attendance record was spotty, she 
refused to give her teachers any reason to complain about her written
exams.

She wasn&#39;t in her classroom. I found her in the Student Council room and
when I entered, Natsuki was sitting in my chair, fast asleep.

Her chin was propped up in one hand and the other hand was tightly 
clenched into a fist.

I stood behind her and gently laid a hand on her shoulder. So tense.

She&#39;d been through a lot, especially these past few months. I let her 
sleep, she looked like she needed the rest.

&quot;Natsuki.&quot;

I held a few strands of her hair loosely in my hands. I let them go and 
watched them fall.

They fell and caressed her cheek. I wondered. What would it be like, to
wake her with a kiss?

I sighed and firmly placed my hands behind my back. I moved to sit on 
the windowsill and watched her from a distance.

I wondered idly what she would taste like. I shook my head.

I tried to distract myself. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty...

Her hair&#39;s messed up now. Maybe I should fix it? She looks so 
beautiful...

No. No. Naughty Shizuru. I took a deep breath.

Think of something else. Two, four, six...

Don&#39;t go there. Vowel substitution bad.

Three, six, nine, twelve, fifteen...

I turned and resolutely kept my eyes fixed on the view outside the 
window.

Natsuki finally woke up after a while.

&quot;You seemed to be sleeping well.&quot;

She blushed. &quot;S-Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to.&quot;

&quot;You still have some drool on you.&quot; I teased her.

She frantically rubbed her mouth. She looked so cute.

&quot;Just kidding.&quot;

&quot;Shizuru!&quot; She gave me an annoyed glare.

&quot;Haven&#39;t you been working too hard recently? You must be tired.&quot;

&quot;A little.&quot;

&quot;Anything else I can help with, aside from lending you that?&quot;

&quot;Thanks, but I&#39;m heading out now. Sorry to bother your work.&quot;

&quot;Natsuki, I&#39;m always thinking about you. Don&#39;t forget that.&quot; There. Part 
of the truth at least.

&quot;I&#39;m grateful to you. But don&#39;t get too close to me. Please.&quot;

I sighed as she left. I didn&#39;t tell her after all. And after that time I 
didn&#39;t get much of an opportunity to tell her.

After that day, everything became pretty hectic.

But you do not need me to tell you that. You already know most of what 
happened.

How Nao kidnapped Takumi. How Akira-kun was defeated. How Takumi 
disappeared. How Mai burned the forest to the ground.

You know most of what happened, you know how Natsuki learned about her 
mother&#39;s betrayal, you know how she was captured by Nao.

She found herself in trouble that she couldn&#39;t get herself out from.

It was then that I revealed myself to Natsuki.

It was necessary.

-o-

&quot;Stop right there please. I won&#39;t let you hurt Natsuki.&quot;

I wasn&#39;t frightened, I didn&#39;t even feel nervous as I faced Nao.

All I felt was a cold certainty that gripped my heart. It said that now 
was the time to act, now was when Natsuki truly needed me.

I felt removed from myself. Not that my senses were dull, mind you. They 
were on the contrary, extraordinarily sharp.

The light from the full moon seemed to illuminate the night. I could 
hear the crash of the waves, I could smell the salty sea air.

I could sense the slightest hint of breeze stir Natsuki&#39;s hair, I could 
sense Nao&#39;s every motion.

I felt removed from my emotions. I was prepared to fight, to do what was 
necessary to protect her. To protect Natsuki.

&quot;You&#39;re...&quot;

&quot;Yuuki-san, was it?&quot; Yes, I knew her. She was the one who had caused 
Natsuki and the other HiMEs so much trouble.

&quot;For the President to know me, I&#39;ve sure become famous.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re such a poor girl. You must notice too many details. If you were 
a little duller, you could have had an easier life. Having been 
restricted by your surroundings, you were able to live only by paying so 
much attention. Am I wrong?&quot;

I knew about her past. The president did have access to information 
other students didn&#39;t have.

&quot;What is this? You think you&#39;re some sort of counselor? Are you saying 
that you understand the situation here?&quot;

I just smiled. I understood the situation perfectly.

A crazy psycho - regardless of how she got that way - was threatening to 
harm my Natsuki.

Wouldn&#39;t happen. Definitely wouldn&#39;t happen.

&quot;Oh, I see.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right, it&#39;s not my business to know what kind of past you had. 
All I want is to protect Natsuki.&quot;

I reached out my hand. My naginata materialized.

&quot;I do not forgive those who hurt Natsuki, whoever that may be.&quot;

&quot;I see, so the rumor is true. You&#39;re the one who needs a counselor. You 
make me sick.&quot;

From her hands came what looked like the threads of a spider web. They 
wrapped around the blade of my naginata.

Nao looked smug, she seemed so sure of herself. A distant part of me 
pitied her.

&quot;Kiyohime.&quot;

My Child emerged from the ground below us. Maybe it was just my 
imagination but I thought she&#39;d gotten bigger.

She threw Nao&#39;s child off the cliff and into the water. I cut off the 
part of the cliff where Nao lay to prevent her from coming after us.

At that time, I had no intention of defeating anyone else&#39;s Child. I had 
no intention of being a player of any sort in the mad Festival.

I just wanted to get Natsuki to safety.

I brought her to a house that belonged to one of the students I taught 
tea brewing to..</pre>
