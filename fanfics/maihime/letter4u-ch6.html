fanfiction by <a href="../authors/arcajeth.html">Arca Jeth</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/letter4u-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Ani-ue, my heart is confused.

I tried to take your advice about Mai. When you told me that her 
happiness should be my happiness, I thought I&#39;d found a way out. I 
thought I could find a way to live without her love. But I was wrong.

You probably know by now that I moved out. I couldn&#39;t take living with 
her anymore, knowing that her smile wasn&#39;t mine alone. Knowing that her 
kiss wasn&#39;t mine alone. Mai is the kindest person I know, but because 
she&#39;s so kind makes her the cruelest person. She couldn&#39;t tell me to go 
away. She couldn&#39;t tell me that she didn&#39;t love me that way.

Yuuichi was the other reason I left. He&#39;s my friend and always kind and 
funny. He makes Mai smile. If Mai chose someone like him it wouldn&#39;t be 
so bad. I could be happy for them. That lie kept me sane for a while. But 
deep in my heart I started to hate him. I wanted to scream at him; &quot;Don&#39;t 
make her smile! Don&#39;t make her laugh! Don&#39;t make her look at you that 
way! Don&#39;t make her give you her heart.&quot;

I left because I hated him. Mai was the one who taught me what real 
love felt like. So, I could never hate something she loves.

Now someone new is in my life. She&#39;s fun to be around and pretty. She 
makes me feel like it&#39;s all right to start living again. I want to give 
myself to Yukino, to let her fill the emptiness if only for a moment. 
But, why is a part of me holding back? Why can&#39;t I just let Mai go and 
start my life over?

Ani-ue, what should I do?</pre>
