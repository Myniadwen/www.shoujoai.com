<pre>aster.

I push my bike to it&#39;s limit for no other reason than my need to feel a 
change of pace. The wind pushing hard against my body feels like 
freedom. The road seems to stretch on endlessly as the sun begins to set 
behind me. I know I should head back but I can&#39;t yet. This feels too 
good to stop. This is the only thing that I have that is mine and mine 
alone.

More miles are put behind me as I keep going farther from home than I 
had planned. She is waiting for me, I know. I promised to have an answer 
when I return. She&#39;ll worry. She always does.

I pull off at a rest stop and push some change into a pay phone, half 
hoping she would answer, half hoping she wouldn&#39;t. I almost give up 
after a few rings but of course she picks up just as I was about to hang 
up. &quot;It&#39;s me,&quot; I say. I know I don&#39;t need to say more.

Her breath catches as it always does when I call. She doesn&#39;t bother to 
hide her excitement. &quot;Is everything okay?&quot; she asks when I don&#39;t say 
anything.

&quot;Yeah. It&#39;s just I&#39;m terrible on the phone,&quot; I answer. Even here in this 
phone booth I can&#39;t help but fidget as I try to think of what to say. 
Why is this always so hard?

&quot;Ara... It&#39;s always better when it&#39;s us all alone, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

Yes.

&quot;I just wanted to let you know I&#39;ll be a while longer. So you don&#39;t 
worry or anything.&quot;

Her reply is quiet, almost inaudible. I don&#39;t mean to avoid the question 
but it&#39;s that sort of thing that has led me out here today. She says she 
loves me before we get off the phone. She always does.

&quot;I know,&quot; I always say.

Back on my bike I push myself harder. I seem to think more clearly that 
way. But now that I&#39;ve spoken to her it seems I&#39;m thinking too clearly. 
Too vividly.

She&#39;s an idiot for letting me hurt her for so long. No, I&#39;m an idiot for 
hurting her for so long.

I remember everything that we&#39;ve done. Every word, every touch, every 
tear. I&#39;ve led her on, and she has willingly let me. She&#39;s begged me and 
I&#39;ve given her what she has asked.

She has cried every single time.

Then morning comes and I&#39;m always gone. She&#39;s shattered over what I&#39;ve 
just done yet she never stops me. She says its worth the pain if it&#39;s 
with me. She says that I&#39;m the only one she will ever desire. I know 
it&#39;s true. I know her love for me is stronger than her will to live. 
I&#39;ve already seen that side of her.

&quot;Why do you do this to me Natsuki?&quot; her voice asks in my thoughts.

I like the sounds you make when we&#39;re shaking.

Without warning I swing my bike in the other direction and race home. My 
own heart is breaking as I think of her sitting there, tear-stained 
face, waiting paitently for what I&#39;m sure she assumes will be another 
heart break.

The wind that felt so much like freedom now feels as if it&#39;s working 
against me. I want to see her smiling face. I want to stop punishing her 
for my fear. I want to say the things I have always kept locked inside.

I want her.

It&#39;s past one in the morning before I reach her apartment. As expected 
she is sitting there waiting for my return. Waiting for me to hurt her 
again. &quot;Shizuru,&quot; I say as I walk in and her eyes immediately find my 
own.

I walk to her stereo and turn it up, loud and distracting. Drowning us 
out. I don&#39;t care what&#39;s playing.

Usually it is her that loses control.

This time I do as I push her down on the couch and press my lips to 
hers. She doesn&#39;t fight. She never does. Never questions. Just quietly 
accepts whatever it is I&#39;m willing to give.

The tears are in her eyes again and I know her heart is breaking as much 
as it is rejoycing at the feel of my touch. I feel her everywhere, my 
hands moving over her body and memorizing every inch of it.

&quot;I&#39;ve come to tell you it&#39;s all worked out,&quot; I say in her ear as I push 
against her.

She doesn&#39;t reply. She&#39;s too afraid. Her whole body is trembling with 
fear and anticipation. I feel myself getting lost in her warmth. Pushing 
harder. She cries for more.

I like the way you breathe when we&#39;re moving.

Her nails sting in my back but I don&#39;t think about it. It&#39;s the only 
mark she&#39;s ever been allowed to leave on me. I let her hold on to me as 
long as she needs and finally she lets go. She doesn&#39;t try to hide her 
tears from me anymore. I don&#39;t try to wipe them away anymore.

&quot;Are you going to leave?&quot; she asks when I sit up.

I take her hand in mine and place it over the button of my jeans. She 
looks at me unsure but doesn&#39;t hesitate. It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever 
let her touch me. It is my answer without words.

&quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere,&quot; I whisper as her tears start again. This time 
I know they are not caused by me hurting her. I hold onto her tightly as 
we move together. Forward and back. Deeper. More. Finally I understand 
her need.

My name falls from her lips over and over again. We don&#39;t stop until we 
can no longer move. Everything in the past seems insignificant as she 
sleeps in my arms for the first time. She holds onto me tightly, afraid 
that I will be gone like all the times before.

Not anymore.

I love you.

That&#39;s what I will tell her next time.</pre>
