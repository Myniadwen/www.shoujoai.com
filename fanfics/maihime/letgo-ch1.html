<h1>Let Go</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mr_pointy.html">Mr. Pointy</a><br> </h2>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki Kuga was hoping 
her lover, Shizuru Fujino was still awake.  The couple had been spooning 
after a very long, emotionally intense lovemaking session and she’d 
hoped Shizuru wasn’t completely exhausted.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The delinquent, blue-haired 
biker and student of Fuuka Academy, was glad when the student council 
leader stirred behind her and planted a delicate kiss on the back of 
her neck.  She had a request and now, she thought, was the best 
time to ask it.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">It was the anniversary 
of the day of their final battle during the Carnival.  While Natsuki 
had known her closest friend was psychotically in love with her before 
then, it was only on that day that she accepted her friend’s feelings.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki’s own romantic 
feelings for Shizuru didn’t fully blossom until long after the end 
the Carnival, and their relationship had only become sexual a short 
time ago.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The couple had discussed 
the event rather solemnly over dinner.  The depth of the moment 
had led to Shizuru tenderly making love to her Natsuki in their bedroom, 
illuminated by the moonlight and fueled by Shizuru’s sweet nothings 
and charged whispers of ‘I love you’.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">While Natsuki was never 
bothered when Shizuru took charge in the bedroom, she realised that 
she herself had never initiated their lovemaking.  It was a rather 
detached observation, considering the significance of the day, but it 
stirred something within her.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki ran a little 
scenario in her head after she’d made Shizuru climax.  The thought 
snowballed until it became a fantasy, and then became something tangible.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki was pretty 
sure Shizuru would enjoy what she was planning; she had a… playful 
imagination, but she hoped her lover wouldn’t press the matter as 
she thought she’d die of embarrassment if Shizuru got it out of her.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">While the biker girl 
was normally rather outspoken, her personal desires and her will to 
communicate them were fragile and could dissolve like sherbet on her 
tongue.  She had to say her piece now while her resolve was its 
strongest.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Shizuru?”  
Natsuki whispered.  She felt her lover’s form stir again.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Yes?”  The brunette 
responded in her lilting Kyoto-ben.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Um…” Natsuki 
hesitated.  Some of her courage evaporated at the sound of Shizuru’s 
voice.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“There’s something 
I’d like to do with you.  Tomorrow… when you get back from the council 
meeting.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The tiniest of smirks 
appeared on Shizuru’s face.  She propped herself up, wanting to see 
her lover’s reaction.  “Ara… Is my Natsuki thinking of doing 
something naughty to me?” She teased.  It wasn’t anything mean; 
Natsuki just looked so cute when flustered. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“It’s… w-well…” 
Natsuki sputtered.  Shizuru’s banter often left her red-faced, 
like now.  “Look, I’m… not used to asking this kind of thing.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru looked at Natsuki 
for a long moment.  “I’m sorry.”  Shizuru said; realising 
what Natsuki wanted to say was very important.  “Just say what you 
have to.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru put a hand 
on her girlfriend’s shoulder and gently squeezed, trying to reassure 
her.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki took another 
breath and persisted, expressing her desire as best as she could.  
“There’s something I want to try with you.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">She turned around in 
Shizuru’s embrace, wanting to gaze in those garnet eyes.  Her 
lover’s intensity made her falter again, but she pressed on.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“I… don’t know 
if I can say what I want aloud.  I’m not used to it; not with 
this kind of thing anyway.  But… just trust me.  When it 
happens tomorrow, just go along with it.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Of course.” 
Shizuru gave her lover a small, caring smile.  She held her closer 
and gently kissed her on the forehead.  “You know I’ll do anything 
for you.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki quietly sighed 
in relief, melting into the brunette’s embrace and smiling back. “Thank 
you.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Besides, I like 
surprises.”</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Oh you…”</font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" 
face="Calibri">--------&lt;&gt;--------&lt;&gt;--------</font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The apartment was eerily 
quiet when Miss Fujino returned home from a particularly boring Thursday 
student council meeting.  Like clockwork, Natsuki would be sitting at 
the dining room table with the notebook computer, typing up an assignment, 
doing some research on the internet, or, very occasionally, shopping 
online for lingerie.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The fact that she wasn’t 
there was rather odd.  One of the dining room chairs being in the 
middle of the living room was also peculiar.  It was a very sturdy, 
wooden, Western-style chair; something more to Natsuki’s taste than 
hers.  The very Japanese woman preferred a very Japanese dining 
table, especially a nice, warm kotatsu.  Those chairs got too cold in 
winter.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Natsuki said she 
was planning something…” Shizuru thought aloud.  It didn’t seem 
that she was here.  Maybe, she thought, Natsuki was out preparing 
things or purchasing some... interesting items, and that she’d be 
back later.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shrugging at the peculiarity 
of the situation, Shizuru walked towards the chair to move it back to 
its place.  It was then she felt a presence behind her.  She quickly 
turned to see her Natsuki.  Shizuru was baffled as to how she could 
appear so swiftly without making a sound.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki was wearing 
one of her riding suits.  It was a magnificently form-fitting, 
blue, white and black Alpinestars one-piece leather riding suit she 
had bought barely a month ago.  She had the matching boots on as 
well, but not the gloves.  Shizuru thought she looked devastatingly 
sexy, like a predatory cat about pounce on her prey.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The beautiful, blue-haired 
girl’s face was set with a very determined look.  The gorgeous 
kaichou had seen it many times; particularly during the Carnival, but 
there was something slightly different about it this time.  There 
was a hunger in those emerald eyes that Shizuru couldn’t place at 
all.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The look on Natsuki’s 
face was almost distracting enough for Shizuru to not notice her left 
hand pulling the zip on her racing suit down.  A tantalising expanse 
of creamy flesh slowly appeared before Shizuru’s eyes.  There 
was that wonderful cleavage.  She wasn’t wearing a bra; Shizuru was 
sure the leather would chafe her nipples.  Shizuru suddenly wondered 
if Natsuki was wearing panties under there.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The zipper went further 
down, revealing Natsuki’s flat, toned stomach and that lovely little 
belly-button.  Shizuru would occasionally flick her kitten-like 
tongue into her lover’s belly-button during foreplay or after giving 
head.  She loved the taste of her lover’s sweat and she enjoyed 
the musical giggle or gasp of surprise that would come.  Natsuki 
would then playfully admonish Shizuru for being weird, and it would 
generally lead to another round of satisfying sex.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru’s deep garnet 
eyes were transfixed on that gorgeous flesh.  She wanted to lick 
every inch of it until every drop of perspiration was gone and it shone 
with her saliva. The kaichou was so entranced by that smooth skin and 
those dangerous curves, that she didn’t even notice Natsuki’s right 
hand had been behind her back and had not moved the whole time.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki slowly bridged 
the gap between the two until they were mere centimeters from each other.  
Her breathing was not heavy but certainly ragged.  Her expression 
flickered between determination, desire and nervousness, her eyes still 
burned with passion.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru did not want 
to make any physical moves toward Natsuki for fear of putting her off.  
She realised that this was part of Natsuki’s fantasy and she’d go 
with it; whatever it may be.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri"> The brunette’s curiosity 
however, got the better of her, so she cocked a small half-grin and 
wondered aloud, “Ara… what <i>is</i> my Natsuki plan--“</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki forcefully 
slammed her lips against Shizuru’s, gripping the back of her head 
with her free hand.  The blue-haired girl shot her tongue into 
the brunette’s mouth with such ferocity that Shizuru literally couldn’t 
respond physically for a full second.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru could not believe 
that her Natsuki-chan was being this fierce.  While the blue-haired 
girl was more often than not a serious, driven person, Shizuru had always 
been the one to initiate anything sexual.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Even when they fooled 
around or made love, Natsuki was always so tentative and gentle.  It 
was as if the blue-haired girl was still somewhat unsure of her feelings 
when she touched her girlfriend.  She wasn’t of course, Shizuru could 
feel Natsuki’s love in every lick or caress.  But her actions 
were more timid than the brunette’s passionate aggression.  Not 
that it bothered her in any way.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">This was different.  
Natsuki’s kisses and movements were driven by fire and passion.  There 
was no hesitance.  It was as if she was ravenous and Shizuru was 
the most delicious thing she had ever seen.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The rather amusing 
thought of Natsuki licking mayonnaise off of her popped in the kaichou’s 
mind.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki kept attacking 
Shizuru’s mouth, barely letting her think about anything else other 
than the feel of the wonderfully brutal kiss and the amazing tongue 
in her mouth.  The brunette didn’t even notice that she had been 
moved ever so slowly towards that dining room chair.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru bumped into 
that oddly-placed furniture with the back of her shapely thighs and 
sat down on it with an unceremonious plop.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki went back to 
kissing her, letting the kaichou’s tongue inside hers and scraping 
it lightly with her teeth.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru moaned, wondering 
where the hell she learned that because it was driving her wild!  
Natsuki’s wonderful lips, that talented tongue and that amazing mouth 
were making her so very hot.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">In fact, Shizuru could 
only just notice her hands being moved behind the chair and something 
metallic around her wrists.  She pulled back in surprise…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Wha—“</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri"><i>*CLICK*</i></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Once Shizuru’s shock 
wore off, she tugged at the handcuffs.  They were definitely metal, 
but with a soft, black suede padding around the loops.  The chain 
was long enough for Natsuki to loop the cuffs around the outer slats 
of the back of the chair.  Shizuru hadn’t noticed what was being done 
until it was too late.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru looked up at 
Natsuki with both trepidation and anticipation.  She wet her lips, 
but was interrupted before she could ask what was going on.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Just let me try 
this.” Natsuki pleaded.  “Don’t say anything… please?  
I just… I just want to do this for you.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The blue-haired girl 
still had a faint look of nervousness in her tumultuous expression.  
Love, lust, fear, confusion, excitement; a thousand feelings all dancing 
on that beautiful face.  Her green eyes were a storm of emotions.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">But Natsuki was clearly 
unsure of herself.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru nodded her 
understanding.  If she said anything now, she thought, Natsuki 
might lose her nerve.  And chances are, what she was preparing 
was going to be fucking amazing, so she did not want to jeopardise that.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Not even Shizuru had 
attempted anything this bold with Natsuki, she realised.  Sure, 
the brunette could get quite worked up in bed and she had a rather active 
imagination.  However, Shizuru had never tried to do anything too 
kinky, because their sexual relationship was still in its infancy and 
she wasn’t sure how far Natsuki was willing to go.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Though on occasion, 
Shizuru would tease Natsuki with her more… interesting ideas.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The most extreme thing 
the brunette had done with her lover was the time she got her off in 
the student council room barely a week ago.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru had finished 
another tedious meeting and was sorting out paperwork, when Natsuki 
stopped by to visit after everyone else had left.  Their pleasant 
conversation became rather innuendo-laden and had ended with the biker 
girl pushed face-first up against the blackboard, while the kaichou 
pressed against her, shoved her hand down her panties and got her off 
by roughly rubbing her clit with her thumb and fucking her with two 
fingers.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">After cumming like 
she was hit by a train, Natsuki gave Shizuru a satisfied smile and kissed 
her tenderly on the side of the mouth, still shaking from the after 
effects of that mind blowing orgasm.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">It was the first time 
they had done it so quickly or roughly, or so brazenly out in the open.  
Shizuru was glad that Natsuki had enjoyed it.  Their lovemaking, 
while passionate, was still rather gentle and they’d always taken 
their time.  And it was always in their shared apartment or somewhere 
private.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">However, there were 
a handful of occasions where Shizuru would suggest something out of 
the ordinary.  Jokingly, in general, but Shizuru had caught the 
impression that Natsuki was interested in trying them.  A subtle 
look, a little twinge in the inflection of her voice; Shizuru picked 
up these little cues.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru was mentally 
crossing her fingers when she made her move on Natsuki in the student 
council room and was pleased she responded so enthusiastically.  
Apparently, the kaichou realised as she was being ground against the 
chair by the biker girl’s lithe body, she loved it more than she first 
thought.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki gave her lover 
more searing kisses.  The brunette responded by humming her pleasure 
in the back of Natsuki’s throat.  If she had to be restrained 
for her blue-haired lover to be this wonderfully dominant, Shizuru thought, 
then she’d gladly submit to it anytime and anywhere.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki had her right 
leg knelt upon the chair, her thigh right up against Shizuru’s covered 
crotch.  The kaichou couldn’t help but grind against it; Natsuki 
was making her so damn horny.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">She’d have used her 
hands to help get both of them off, but they were restrained at the 
moment.  The biker girl’s hands, however, were working on unbuttoning 
Shizuru’s blazer and uniform shirt.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki got her lover’s 
constricting uniform open, revealing a plain-looking, if elegantly designed 
white bra.  Luckily for her, this one had the latch on the front.  
It’d be much easier to undo considering Shizuru’s current position.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The blue-haired girl 
fumbled with the fastener, while planting light kisses on Shizuru’s 
jaw and throat, occasionally nipping at her skin with her teeth and 
leaving little red marks in their wake.  Natsuki even lightly ran 
one of her eye teeth across the kaichou’s jugular vein.  It made 
Shizuru’s sigh with pleasure, and wonder what terrible vampire novels 
her Natsuki had been reading recently.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">A click was heard, 
and Natsuki stopped mauling her lover’s neck to concentrate on removing 
her bra.  She spread open Shizuru’s clothing and undergarment 
further off her chest to get a better look at those splendid breasts.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">To Natsuki, they were 
beautiful; not too big but still ample, nicely rounded in shape (a rice 
bowl was the first thing to come to Natsuki’s mind) and didn’t bow 
to gravity in the slightest.  Her areolas, about the size of 100-yen 
coins, were a dusky caramel.  Her nipples, hard like little rock 
candies, were upturned slightly, as if they were seeking Heaven for 
sanctity.  They were a superb contrast to Shizuru’s pale, creamy 
skin.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki stared at them 
with naked hunger.  That look made Shizuru think she’d simply 
attack them like she did with her mouth and throat.  Her pussy got wetter 
at the thought and she shifted slightly on the seat.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The biker girl instead 
began to smoothly and gently run the palms of her hands on her lover’s 
breasts.  She very tenderly drew her fingertips around those mounds.  
It was almost as if Natsuki was touching them for the first time, trying 
to memorise the texture and shape of those wonderful tits by touch alone.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">To Shizuru, it felt 
as if they were being worshipped.  The idea made her feel incredibly 
sexy, like some kind of Japanese fertility goddess.  If her hands 
were free, she mused, she’d grant her Natsuki a most wonderful wish.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Hah…”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The brunette gasped 
as the blue-haired girl’s fingertips reached her nipples.  Her 
sensitive buds lit up at the feather light touch.  The kisses, 
the biting, the caresses and the complete lack of control made Shizuru 
wonderfully aroused.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The contrast of Natsuki’s 
rough play and subsequent gentleness was making her nerves almost hypersensitive.  
Her body felt like it was burning, with heat radiating from her exposed 
skin like a microwave and her nerves prickling with delicious electricity 
with every touch.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru didn’t think 
it was possible to feel any better than this.  Then Natsuki took 
her left nipple into her mouth and she was gladly mistaken.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Hssssss…  Yes!  
Harder!”  The brunette hissed as her lover licked and sucked 
on the caramel bud.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki’s hot mouth 
engulfed one nipple, lashing and torturing it with her talented tongue, 
while flicking and pinching the free one with her fingers and thumb.  
She alternated between both breasts, leaving the sensitive buds glazed 
in a thin film of saliva.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki scraped Shizuru’s 
right nipple delicately with her teeth, enjoying the mewling sound that 
came from the kaichou’s throat.  In fact, she liked it so much; 
she did the same to the other one.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Don’t stop!”  
Shizuru writhed like a snake caught in a trap, furiously grinding against 
her lover in a deliciously futile effort to climax.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki instead gave 
her lover a small grin and retreated from Shizuru’s breasts.  
Her hands stirred on their own as they undid the brunette’s uniform 
skirt.  The position wasn’t great for getting them off, so Natsuki 
moved off the chair and knelt in front of Shizuru to get better access 
to her lower half.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Lift your butt up 
for a second.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru shifted up 
from the chair to let the blue-haired girl remove her skirt, throwing 
it on the floor.  Natsuki then slowly rolled her girlfriend’s 
rather fetching white panties out of the way, leaving them bunched up 
on her left ankle.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“You’re not going 
to take them off?” Shizuru asked.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki answered her 
question evasively by trilling Shizuru’s belly-button with her tongue.  
The brunette’s response to that ministration was halfway between a 
surprised gasp and a strangled cry.  </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“I think you look 
sexier this way.”  Natsuki whispered.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">To the blue-haired 
girl, Shizuru looked ravishing.  Her sweat-matted, golden brown 
hair was a gorgeous mess.  A damp strand or two had somehow ended up 
in her mouth, accentuating her flushed face and her stormy, heavy-lidded 
garnet eyes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru’s gorgeous 
tits heaved erotically with every laboured breath and her exposed body 
was shining with perspiration, making her seem luminescent during the 
early-evening sunset.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The best part, Natsuki 
thought, was Shizuru’s wonderfully glistening pussy.  Her pink 
folds were parted like a perverse cherry blossom and copious juices 
were leaking from her box and coating her neat, chestnut brown pubic 
hair and creamy white inner thighs.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">While Natsuki drank 
in Shizuru’s gorgeously disheveled form, her mind dawned on an interesting 
realisation.  Every time they’d been intimate, Natsuki thought, 
they had made love.  However, this would only be the second time 
they would fuck.  There was a definite distinction in Natsuki’s 
mind about these forms of intimacy, like comparing a flowery romance 
novel and a Penthouse Forum letter.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The idea of <i>fucking</i> 
Shizuru, Natsuki mused, was goddamn hot.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Shizuru,” Natsuki 
breathed, barely containing her arousal, “I’m going to fuck you.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru’s breath 
hitched in her throat at those words.  Natsuki may have been blunt 
with her language, but she was rarely this dirty.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Then do it.”  
She breathed, licking her lips with anticipation.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki shifted closer 
between her lover’s legs, her hands spreading them further apart to 
get access to her gorgeous pussy.  She could feel Shizuru’s inner 
thighs trembling under her palms. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Hah!”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki gave Shizuru 
a quick peck on her left thigh, startling her with the delicate action.  
Maybe, the brunette mused, she wanted to tease her a while.  The thought 
left her grinning.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Then the biker girl 
gave the kaichou’s spasming box a broad, rough lick and her grin turned 
into a deep moan.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Usually, Natsuki was 
gentle when eating her lover, but she was devouring her box, licking, 
sucking and nipping at Shizuru’s sakura pink folds and driving her 
tongue inside her core, savouring her deep, earthy flavour.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki wasn’t going 
straight for Shizuru’s most sensitive places; she wanted this to last 
a while, but her attack on Shizuru’s pussy was having the desired 
effect.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“OH GOD!”  
Shizuru panted, “Don’t stop!  Don’t stop, Natsuki!”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki was making 
all sorts of obscene grunts and noises from her throat while she ate 
Shizuru’s snatch, the vibrations sending extra tremors of pleasure 
up the brunette’s spine and making her roll her hips and grind against 
the blue-haired girl’s face, in the hope of getting off quicker.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki began to target 
the more sensitive folds and ridges and was lightly flicking on and 
around Shizuru’s clitoris with her tongue.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">She kept prolonging 
her attack, but kept Shizuru from cumming.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru sobbed at the 
pleasure she felt.  “God, please Natsuki…  lick my clit… 
make me cum!  I want to cum!”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The brunette was bucking 
her hips wildly now, try to get Natsuki’s tongue to her more sensitive 
places.  Yet the biker girl kept a firm hold on her lover’s thighs, 
maintaining control.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru was slowly 
going mad from Natsuki’s wonderful tongue.  She normally came 
fairly quickly, but her lover was driving her threshold further and 
further past her usual limit.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru felt two of 
Natsuki’s fingers spread and play with her glistening folds, cranking 
her up even further.  Her pussy was alight and her juices ran, 
pooling on the chair in a sticky puddle.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">God, she thought, if 
only she could get Natsuki’s tongue a little more on her clit she’d…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Ohhhh…  Ohh…  
OHHHHHH!”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki must have felt 
Shizuru deserved a little more, because she suckled on Shizuru’s clit 
and her two fingers pumped in and out of her with almost brutal force.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Within moments, the 
brunette was gone.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru’s snatch 
clamped around Natsuki’s fingers, slowing her thrusting down, as she 
rode what she thought was the biggest orgasm she’d ever experienced 
in her young life.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki kept lashing 
at Shizuru’s clit, but pulled her fingers out of her box and tickled 
her exposed asshole, hoping to bring her to an elusive multiple-orgasm.  
It was enough.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru had played 
with her ass on very rare occasions, and it did add a little extra… 
oomph when she was incredibly horny.  But the feeling of her Natsuki 
at her back door sharpened her senses to an almost knifepoint and her 
body exploded with a second orgasm.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru wanted to tell 
Natsuki just how wonderful she was making her feel, how the divine pleasure 
had taken her out of her body and she could almost feel herself floating 
in the air.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">However all Shizuru 
could do was scream raggedly until she ran out of breath and thrash 
on the chair as she was consumed by a cataclysmic blaze.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">After being launched 
into the stratosphere for a few minutes, Shizuru came back down and 
was pleased to find Natsuki slowly lapping at her box, her emerald eyes 
boring into hers with unadulterated lust.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki smiled while 
she lightly licked Shizuru’s still trembling snatch, looking like 
the cat that got the cream.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The thought left Shizuru 
grinning.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" 
face="Calibri">--------&lt;&gt;--------&lt;&gt;--------</font> <br>
</p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Are you going to 
let me out of these?”  Shizuru breathed.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki had straddled 
Shizuru on the chair, and they’d been making out for the past 15 minutes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">While Shizuru enjoyed 
the deep kisses, the cuffs were starting to get a little uncomfortable.  
Not to mention she had a burning desire to touch Natsuki and her lack 
of mobility was starting to drive her mad.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Yeah.  Sure.”  
Natsuki relented.  She shifted off her lover to get a pair of small 
silver keys off the coffee table.  Climbing on Shizuru again, Natsuki 
slipped her hands behind the chair and undid the locks.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Mmmmmmm… better.”  
Shizuru hummed, rubbing her wrists.  She put her arms around Natsuki’s 
neck and kissed her, languidly slipping her tongue inside.  Natsuki’s 
hands settled on her lover’s hips.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“I didn’t think 
Natsuki has this kind of thing in her.”  Shizuru teased.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki blushed and 
murmured, “Neither did I.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru smiled.  
“Why handcuffs?”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki stared at Shizuru 
for a long moment, trying to think of a satisfactory reply.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“I don’t know.”  
It was a lie.  Natsuki really didn’t want to say that the sheer 
intensity of her lover’s passion was almost frightening and if she 
gave her an avenue to exercise control, Natsuki would lose her will 
in a second.  The handcuffs were just as much for Natsuki’s courage 
as they were for Shizuru’s pleasure. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“I really wanted 
to do this with you, Shizuru,” Natsuki continued, changing the subject.  
“I’ve always loved how you make me feel, but… I’ve never really 
expressed my feelings well enough.  Not in this way…”  
She trailed off.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki looked away 
and her voice changed to a low whisper for the next part.  “I 
was… afraid you wouldn’t like it.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“I loved it.”  
Shizuru replied honestly.  She moved herself forward until her 
lips were mere millimetres from Natsuki’s, and breathed her affirmation.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“And there is <i>
nothing</i> I would not with Natsuki.  Not a thing.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">The raw lust in Shizuru’s 
voice during her declaration made Natsuki shiver.  “Well…”  
She whispered, “I guess… if there’s something you want to do…”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki swallowed, 
partly because Shizuru’s right hand had slithered into her racing 
suit to cup her breast, and partly because she felt was about to open 
Pandora’s Box with her next words.  She looked into her girlfriend’s 
eyes as she said…</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“I should be up for 
it as well.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“Ara… in that case,” 
The brunette grinned almost maniacally.  “Would you mind if I borrowed 
these for tonight?”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Shizuru held up the 
handcuffs with one finger on her free hand.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">Natsuki’s face went 
redder than a tomato.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Calibri">“…sure.”</font> <br>
