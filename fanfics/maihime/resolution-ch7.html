<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The first  interlude: Mai</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  the carnival ended, I really thought I could be happy.  For a few  days, I was;  just riding on a cloud everywhere I went.  How could I  not have been?  Everybody that had died, that I had <em>watched </em>die,  was alive.  All of them.  It was like the ending to a western action  movie; the hero rides off into the sunset, with his (or, in my case,  her) newfound lover, and they live happily ever after—or at least,  that’s the assumption.  In my Western Studies class at Fuuka  Academy, we watched some western action movies, and I always loved  that ending.  I saw how hard the hero worked without even a single  complaint, and in a moment of wild fantasy, I think I wanted to <em>be </em>them; wanted their happy ending.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  the action movies never show is how the hero’s feelings change.   How they are at all, really.  We don’t know if the hero resents the  woman for what she made him do; if the woman feels that the hero  thinks of her as more of a conquest, hard-earned but a conquest just  the same.  We don’t know what kind of tensions they’ll go  through, or if they’ll break up a week after they get together  because it turns out they don’t like each other.  There are no  “Happily ever afters”.  In some ways, I prefer Samurai movies to  westerns because of that; at least at the end of those, the hero  usually dies and doesn’t have to worry about whether or not some  obnoxious brat with a crush and a “prior claim” will get in the  way of what they’ve worked so hard to earn.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  sounds really bad, huh? I’m never this negative in public; I think  that’s why I’m writing it all down.  I sound really bitter, and I  guess in some ways, I am.  It’s just that I worked <em>so. Fucking.  Hard. </em>And I sacrificed <em>so. Fucking. Much. </em>Not physical  things, though; not really.  I sacrificed a piece of my sanity at  that carnival. A big piece.  And I lost a big chunk of trust for all  of my friends.  How do you get over it and trust somebody who tried,  very hard, to kill you and somebody you love very dearly and nearly  succeeded?  How do they trust you when you killed them or the ones  they love instead?  Even if it’s over now, it’s not really over.   It’s like those Imperial soldiers still hiding out in the woods  decades after World War 2 ended. <strong>(A/N: I looked fairly hard for a  more Japanese perspective on World War II; something like what they  referred to it as, but I couldn’t find it. If anybody has any  ideas, I’d be happy to hear them, and I might even edit them in  here with credit to you. --Veg) </strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I still  remember seeing Mikoto after she killed Takumi and Tate—I guess  that sounds worse than it is, too, but not by much—and I remember  forgetting all the love I had ever felt for her.  I remember suddenly  seeing not her face, but her external and external carotid arteries,  just pump-pump-pumping away that poison and shit she must have had  for blood right into her head. I remember wanting to stop that. I  remember wanting to find out if that thing actually <em>did </em>pump  shit and poison.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That’s  the thing about rage.  Rage is extremely potent up to a certain  point, and then you just overdose on it and suddenly, you don’t  feel angry at all, just curious.  You start thinking about really  morbid things you could do to somebody.  You want to do them really,  really bad.  It’s like being drugged.  I’ve been drugged  recently, too.  A week after the carnival, after I fell off of my  cloud, I had a nervous breakdown and I was hospitalized for a week.   I kept seeing Takumi and Tate dying in my head; right in front of me.   I kept feeling Tate’s lips press on mine; kept feeling how they  felt strangely light and airy as they dissolved.  How we never really  got a kiss, because he vanished before we really could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  remember at that time having visitors.  Everybody from Chie to Reito  to Midori visited me at least three times; I was more or less  catatonic when I wasn’t screaming, so I have to admit, I wasn’t a  very good friend at that point.  The only person who didn’t visit  me was Mikoto.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">By the  time we decided in the spring to go to the beach house—something  I’m looking forward to a lot; I really think I can have a good time  here, and maybe, with Tate…anyway—Mikoto and I were okay again;  better than okay, really, but there was a lot that led up to that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After a  week in the hospital—actually, a nurse told me that it was almost a  week to the hour—Mikoto showed up in my room. She didn’t  apologize to me.  No, she didn’t apologize to me at all.  On the  contrary; she was very, very angry at me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  remember just thinking, <em>get the fuck out of here…I just want to  get the fuck away from you. </em>When she walked in.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  walked in and we had a staring contest for about three minutes.  I  think I lost, but I’m not actually sure.  Then she said, out of  nowhere, standing at the door with her arms folded under her cute  little breasts (wow, that came out way different than I wanted it to,  but it stays anyway because that’s honestly what I thought) “If  Mai is going to sit there fighting me in your head, then stand up and  fight me for real so that we can settle this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That was  the first thing that made me react.  I looked up at her, and I saw  that little artery again.  Saw it pumping.  Saw it pumping out Tate  and Takumi’s death; saw that confused, resigned expression on her  face that she had had as my brother and my ...(I’ll write it down  here because I can’t say it out loud yet) lover vanished in front  of me.  On me. In my arms. <em><strong><u>DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW IT  FEELS TO HAVE SOMEBODY DIE IN YOUR ARMS IT IS LIKE TAKING A SHIT WITH  THE DEVIL </u></strong>(Page is torn here).</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  happens to me sometimes. I think it happens to Mikoto too, but she  never tells me about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked down at me and said, “Go on. Get up. Fight me.  Or I’ll  kill them both again.” She spoke so coldly; that left an impression  on me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  remember actually standing up when she said this, somehow ready to  fight her to the death, convinced that she was telling the truth.   Once I stood up, she said, “follow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I did.   I wasn’t walking quite right at that point, but to me it was like  floating. My first activity in a week.  At all.  I remember the nurse  just <em>staring </em>at me like I was a ghost. I remember being sucked  back to that carnival; suddenly, Tate and Takumi were dead all over  again, and I was going to kill that little bitch for killing them. I  was going to fucking pop her, burn her into a little cinder block. I  would have Kagutschi blow her up and then take an avian shit on her  chest and then…anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mikoto  led me to the waiting room, and suddenly something popped in my head,  because Tate and Takumi were sitting right there.  How was that  possible?  They were both dead.  For that matter, where was Miroku,  Mikoto’s big sword? They both just sat there, staring at me but  glancing at Mikoto occasionally, looking for some kind of cue.   Takumi told me later that this had all been planned out, right down  to them just staring at me, by Mikoto and Chie.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mikoto  stepped in front of me, between me and them, and said, “What’s  the problem? Can’t Mai get them out of Mai’s head? They’re  dead. It’s just Mai and me now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…”   I knew in some dim part of my head that Mikoto had planned all this  out, and that this it was going exactly as she had planned it.  I  didn’t know what to do, just like I hadn’t known what to do for  the past week, so I did the same thing I’d done for the past week:  Sit there and stare.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or  maybe,” she continued, “Mai’s problem is that they <em>aren’t </em>dead, and Mai just can’t stuff that into Mai’s skull.  Maybe  Mai can’t reconcile the fact that all of Mai’s hard work actually <em>got</em> Mai somewhere.   Just like when Takumi finally got to go  to that American doctor; Mai just couldn’t understand how things  were really changing. How Mai’s work actually got Mai somewhere;  how it wasn’t just something Mai did because Mai had to, with no  hope of reward.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I think  I stuttered an argument, but she ignored it in any case.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  choose.  Fight me here, or fight Mai.  But in any case, come at me.  I’m getting sick of looking at you like this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tate and  Takumi stood up at this point to stand behind her, and they gave me a  nod.  I don’t know what that nod meant exactly, but I did what  Mikoto said; I went at her.  Slowly, stumbling, I tried to charge  her, to finally get at that artery.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mikoto  sidestepped me and tripped me and I fell into Takumi and Tate, who  caught me with ease. I was pretty light by that point, so I can’t  imagine it would have been too hard; I hadn’t eaten much that week,  and it was all by IV anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked  up at them, felt their skin (not dissolving), their warmth.  Tate  kissed me on the forehead (I would have liked more, but we were in  public, Takumi was right there, and he told me later he would have  felt wrong doing it; it would have been like kissing somebody while  they were sleeping), “There. Now we’ve both kissed a dead  person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I just  stared up at him, and he grinned. “I’m only as dead as you are,  Mai.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Takumi  said exactly the same thing, and something popped in my head again.  It was my sanity, only this time, it was coming back to me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then I  felt Mikoto—warm, alive, caring Mikoto—press up against my back,  and she whispered into my ear something that she would repeat many  times afterward: “Smiling Mai is the best Mai there is.  Mai should  smile, because they’re all alive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All that  coldness, that evil that had radiated off of her was gone in an  instant, and I wondered if it was ever really there. I think it was  this that really brought me back: I decided that it wasn’t.  It  couldn’t be; there was simply no way for me to reconcile this kind,  warm Mikoto with the bitch who had killed Takumi and Tate.  Even if  Mikoto had done that; it was gone now.  All of it.  Done.  Gone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Of  course, even the nurse seeing me recover miraculously wasn’t enough  to get me magically released from the hospital, nor was my sudden  lucidity.  The doctor knew—rightfully so—that I wasn’t all  right just like that; I had another breakdown two das later, but I  recovered from it quickly, with help from nobody at all.  A note from  Fuuka Gakuen’s head nurse, Youko Sagisawa, certainly helped my case  there, (apparently Miss Sagisawa is fairly well-respected in the  medical community), and the head doctor released me half a week  later, with a prescription for antidepressants that I haven’t  touched yet.  Maybe they would make me feel better, stop the bad  times that still poke out now and then, but I refuse to take them.   Maybe I’m scared they’ll stop the good times, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So I  don’t get a happy ending yet.  But I didn’t die, either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And I  think that’s really what’s important.</span></p>
