<h1>Rearranged (part 3 of 11)</h1>

<a href="../maihime/rearranged-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The hotel was large and imposing on the exterior. It&#39;s black windows 
rose countless stories high, reflecting the images of threatening rain 
clouds that were slowly moving across the sky. What an ominous sight, 
thought Shizuru as she stepped out of her limo at the hotel&#39;s entryway. 
The strong winds were rustling her fine silk kimono, and she hurriedly 
made her way into the lobby.

As she walked toward the elevator in the rear of the lobby, heads turned 
to examine and admire her beauty. She was stunning. Her hair was worn up 
in a traditional Japanese style. Her makeup was lightly applied, serving 
only to highlight her finely formed features. The kimono, of course, was 
gorgeous and one of a kind. And she walked as she always did, with 
perfect posture and effortless grace. Everyone in the lobby was 
momentarily captivated by the sight of her, resuming what they were 
doing only when the elevator doors shut, blocking her from view.

Shizuru let out the breath she&#39;d been holding as the doors closed. One 
of her mother&#39;s assistants was accompanying her, and pressed a floor 
button on the elevator panel. The ride was silent as they ascended, the 
trance-like atmosphere interrupted by a dinging sound at the arrival of 
the 30th floor. Shizuru followed the assistant to a set of large 
rosewood doors that contained the private meeting room where today&#39;s 
arrangement was to take place.

Summoning an air of confidence, Shizuru walked into the room.

The young man who stood up from the table was exceedingly handsome. He 
had black, perfectly tousled hair, dark eyes, a well-shaped mouth and 
nose, and was dressed in an expensive western-style suit. When his eyes 
finished trailing up Shizuru&#39;s body and met hers, he flashed her a 
brilliantly white smile.

Bowing, he said, &quot;My name is Tadashi Kouji. It is a pleasure to meet 
you.&quot;

Shizuru politely returned his bow and replied, &quot;My name is Fujino 
Shizuru. It is nice to meet you too.&quot;

They each knelt on opposite sides of the table, with their assistants 
sitting beside and slightly behind each of them. A teapot with fresh hot 
tea was sitting in the center of the table, along with two small 
cylindrical, Japanese-style teacups.

&quot;Would you please pour us some tea, Fujino-san?&quot; He asked with a slight 
smirk on his lips; he was obviously teasing her.

&quot;Why of course, Tadashi-san,&quot; Shizuru replied with forced politeness.

She then artfully poured each of them tea, fighting the urge to dump it 
in his lap as she&#39;d jokingly suggested to Natsuki the night before.

&quot;Ah yes, very nicely done,&quot; he remarked out loud. &quot;Now let&#39;s see, you 
were educated at Fuuka Academy, were you not?&quot;

&quot;That is correct.&quot;

&quot;I myself was educated at the prestigious Eitoku Academy and am now 
attending the University of Tokyo. I understand you are not currently 
enrolled in a university, is that correct?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I am taking a year off of school to complete my training in the 
traditional arts.&quot;

&quot;I see. Yes, that is very good, it is only appropriate that I marry a 
woman who is skilled at tea ceremony, flower-arranging, cooking, and all 
of those things after all. Not to mention a woman who is as 
breathtakingly beautiful as you are, Fujino-san.&quot;

Shizuru blushed and remained silent, not knowing how to respond to such 
a forward compliment. She fumed internally at this his conceitedness and 
audacity. How could her parents actuallyexpect her to marry a man like 
him?

On the other side of the table, Kouji was smiling. He couldn&#39;t believe 
his luck. He had expected a refined and well-mannered young lady to walk 
through those doors, but this Fujino Shizuru was a knockout. Not only 
did she possess all the air and grace of a refined woman, but she was 
also one of the most beautiful things he&#39;d ever laid eyes upon.

A sudden impulse caused him to motion to the two assistants and ask, 
&quot;Could you two leave us for a moment? I&#39;d like to talk with Fujino-san 
in private please.&quot;

They bowed and left, leaving Kouji grinning and Shizuru slightly 
apprehensive. What could he possibly want to talk about in private?

He stood up from his kneeling position at the table and walked around to 
her, offering his hand to help her stand up.

&quot;Come, let us go to the window and take in the view of the city from up 
here,&quot; he said, smiling so that Shizuru couldn&#39;t read his eyes.

They proceeded to the window, where Shizuru rested her hands on the 
banister there. Kouji was slightly behind her, watching her as she 
looked out the window and deciding what he should do next.

The city was rather dreary looking, Shizuru thought, with the clouds 
obscuring the sunlight and the light drizzle that had just started 
coming down. The sudden weight of a hand on her shoulder caused her to 
flinch and turn her head to look at Tadashi-san&#39;s face. He laughed at 
her actions and said, &quot;There&#39;s no need to be so nervous, Fujino-san, 
don&#39;t be so tense.&quot;

Regardless of his casual tone, Shizuru was not comfortable with the 
situation. Tadashi was quite tall and obviously in good shape, making 
him rather intimidating to her in their current situation. Not wanting 
his hand on her any longer, she moved to back away from him, but was 
stopped when he moved his other hand to grab her wrist.

&quot;Now, now, Fujino-san, or should I say Shizuru, there&#39;s really no need 
for this. We are going to be husband and wife in just a few short weeks, 
what&#39;s the use in resisting it?&quot;

&quot;Please let go of me, I&#39;m really not interested or comfortable with 
doing this, Tadashi-san. And please call me Fujino-san, you hardly know 
me.&quot;

Anger flashed through his eyes at this comment, and his grip on her 
wrist tightened. &quot;I will call you whatever I please, Shizuru. And you 
would do well to stop giving me a hard time now, or there will be 
trouble in the future when we are actually married. I will not have a 
troublesome wife!&quot; His tone was harsh, but not loud enough to garner any 
attention from outside the room.

He then moved to kiss Shizuru&#39;s mouth, but she turned her head at the 
last second, his lips falling on her cheek instead. Kouji was furious. 
Never had a woman refused him before. His good looks and status as an 
heir to a multi-billion dollar corporation always gave him his pick of 
gorgeous women. He wasn&#39;t about to be denied what he wanted. Grabbing 
both of her wrists, he twisted them and held them with one hand behind 
her back. With his other hand he grabbed her chin roughly and forced a 
kiss on her mouth.

Shizuru felt the bile rising in her throat as he kissed her with his 
tongue snaking around her mouth. She&#39;d never felt so turned off by 
anything in her life. She was helpless to knee him in the groin, as her 
kimono made it impossible for her to lift her leg up. Struggling seemed 
to be of no use, as his strong grip held her firmly where he wanted her. 
Tears leaked from the corners of her eyes as she prayed for him to stop.

When he pulled back she was weak from fear. And when she attempted to 
open her mouth and scream or yell for help, no sound could be formed in 
her throat. He sneered at her and said, &quot;That ought to show you what 
happens when you try to act all high and mighty with me. It&#39;s best that 
you learn these lessons now, so I don&#39;t have to keep you in line when 
we&#39;re married.&quot; He then shoved her to the ground and got on top of her. 
&quot;It&#39;s too bad you&#39;re wearing a traditional kimono, or this would&#39;ve been 
a lot easier for me. I guess I&#39;ll just have to take what I can.&quot;

He groped her breast through the fabric of her kimono. Smiling, he said, 
&quot;Well, at least you&#39;re well-endowed, I&#39;d expect no less from someone who 
is to be my wife.&quot; With her arms now free, Shizuru tried to push him 
away, but her strength was no match for his and her efforts were futile. 
She tried to yell for help, but it only came out as a whisper. He 
laughed at her, &quot;Please, you&#39;re making yourself look ridiculous, just 
lay back and accept it.&quot;

By now, tears were streaming out of her eyes and helplessness had 
consumed her body. She never would have expected her fianc&eacute; would be 
such an evil person or that anything remotely like this could&#39;ve 
transpired at their first meeting. One word repeated itself in her mind 
over and over, like a mantra. Natsuki.

Please save me, Natsuki.

As Kouji was hiking up her kimono, she heard a commotion outside the 
door. Within seconds, the doors burst open; and through her tear-filled 
eyes she discerned the image of a raven-haired girl running towards them 
yelling, &quot;What the fuck do you think you&#39;re doing, you filthy bastard!&quot;

Natsuki! Shizuru wanted to yell, but she still could not find her voice. 
Instead she watched as Natsuki grabbed Kouji by the back of his collar, 
pulling him back, and then landing a strong uppercut on his jaw. He fell 
backwards onto the floor and was attacked by Natsuki before he could 
recover. She pummeled him until she was sure he wouldn&#39;t be a problem 
and then went to Shizuru.

Meanwhile the two assistants stood shocked at the scene before them. 
They hurriedly whipped out their cell phones, making calls to their 
superiors to report the situation. The marriage arrangement was called 
off by both parties within the hour.

Leaning over Shizuru, Natsuki cradled her face with her hand, asking, 
&quot;Are you ok? Did he hurt you? What did he do to you?&quot; The worry, fear, 
and concern were etched on her face as she examined her friend with her 
eyes, taking in her disheveled kimono and bruised lips. Unable to answer 
her at the moment, Shizuru began to cry again. Interpreting her silence 
to mean the worst, Natsuki&#39;s eyes widened and rage welled up in her 
chest. &quot;I&#39;m going to kill him,&quot; she stated matter-of-factly as she stood 
up with a murderous look flashing in her eyes.

&quot;Wait,&quot; Shizuru choked out. &quot;Wait,&quot; she repeated in a stronger voice as 
she sat up and grabbed Natsuki&#39;s arm to stop her. Natsuki looked at her, 
waiting for her to tell her why she shouldn&#39;t go kill that bastard right 
here and now.

&quot;I&#39;m...ok. He didn&#39;t...rape me, he was going to, but you came in time to 
stop him. So please, don&#39;t get yourself in trouble by killing him or 
harming him any further. I&#39;ll press charges and have the police take 
care of him, so just...take me home, please.&quot;

Shizuru watched with relief as Natsuki calmed down and returned to her 
side. She helped Shizuru up and led her out of the hotel, but not before 
making sure Shizuru&#39;s assistant called the police and took care of the 
situation there. Natsuki wanted to punch her too, for leaving Shizuru 
alone and obliviously letting this happen to her, but she managed to 
restrain herself.

The police were waiting to question Shizuru about the events that had 
taken place when they arrived at her house in their cab. She sadly bid 
Natsuki farewell, telling her she would come to her apartment as soon as 
all of this mess was taken care of. Natsuki nodded in understanding, 
giving Shizuru&#39;s hand a reassuring squeeze before making her way home.</pre>
