<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What was it that I was searching for? That’s right, when was it? That  time we met, refusing to admit our attraction, it was like a waltz, wasn’t it? </em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Waltz</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Grass  is really an amazing thing,</em> I thought as Aoi and I walked up the path that  would inevitably take us to the ocean. <em>It’s  everywhere. It’s just a tiny little leaf that sticks out of the ground with no  support, and yet it’s probably the most abundant plant in the world; It’s  something people can barely perceive by itself, and yet there isn’t a person  alive who doesn’t know what grass is, that couldn’t draw a blade for you if you  asked.  And you know what? I bet they’d  all draw it a little differently. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  didn’t suppose the gardening club would appreciate me campaigning for grass  recognition, but then, that had never stopped me before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chie?” Aoi’s voice startled me a  little, but I hid it well.  I had almost  forgotten that I had her hand clasped in mine; that she was right there, right  next to me, so absorbed had I become in my own thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>About  grass. </em>I looked up at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  grass is really pretty up here,” she said, her tone more serious than her words  might have suggested.  I hid a grin,  thinking <em>dude! I was just thinking about  grass! </em>a tad inappropriate as a response. After all, I hadn’t even thought  about something as simple and straightforward the way the grass had  looked.  I’d been too focused on  everything else.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I shook my head and looked away from  her, a pang of <em>something </em>hitting me  in my chest.  A thread of hair fell out  from behind my ears, into my face, and I brushed it back absently. As I did,  the grin that I’d been trying to avoid played onto my lips just a little.  “Yeah,” I said, taking in the forest past the  path, past that little slice of land that we as people felt comfortable on  within the confines of this huge, living entity around us.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was like my single word was a cue  for some great omnipotent being.  As soon  as the word passed my lips, it was like the forest came to life, suddenly  possessed of a brilliant orange haze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s  like the forest came to life.  Just for  us. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> Just  for her. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi gasped, and I turned around to  face her, suddenly ready to do…something. I didn’t know what, but something. Something important.  I felt in  that instant that if Aoi would just look at me, only for a second…that  something would happen.  Something.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But she didn’t.  Her eyes and face had lit up, brighter than what  she was gazing at by far; it was like she had entered her own personal nirvana,  and for just a second, I felt something remarkably close to bitterness filter  through me.  I shook it off and squeezed  her hand.  “We should keep moving,” I  said.  “Before it gets too dark to find a  suitable place to stash the corpse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was strange. I said this easily,  but right up until the words formed in my mouth, I had forgotten that we were  there to turn some guy down.  I had just  been…content.  Enthralled with what I was  seeing.  Enthralled with what I was…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her hand tightened on mine, and I  looked straight at her without even thinking about it.  I met her gaze, and for a second, neither of  us moved.  Maybe we couldn’t, or maybe we  just didn’t want to.  I never really  thought about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something started pounding in my  chest, and I wasn’t sure if it was my heart or not.  Aoi looked as though she wanted to say it; I  chanced a glance down at her lips, which were, indeed, moving, mouthing  soundless words at me.  I couldn’t read  them, and it took me a moment to notice</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She’s  closer than she was a second ago </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> What  is she doing? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">that  she was moving.  She almost looked like  she was swaying in the wind, what little there was.  Her hair gently pushed out from her, onto my  face, tickling my cheeks, but I couldn’t move away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Am  I afraid? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> Afraid  of what? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> Afraid  of</em> that?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was struck with the realization that I had no idea what “that” was, and that  made me feel like a second grader.  This  feeling gave me some clue as to what “that” was, but something else in me  refused to acknowledge it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  is she doing? </em>I thought again as she got even closer. <em>What is this girl; this student of mine doing? She is my student, isn’t  she? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> This  isn’t… </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  should keep moving,” I said abruptly, and everything started moving around me  again, cueing me into that it had frozen in the first place. “Like I said,  it’ll be tough enough to hide a corpse in the daylight.”  I tried to start walking again, but Aoi  caught me, refusing to move.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you so angry at him?” she  asked.  “You’ve been propositioned  before; you never got angry then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s nothing,” I said quickly, and  tried to move again. No luck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” she said, her voice a little  throatier this time; a little more serious. “It’s not nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was right.  She was always right about me.  But that didn’t mean that I could explain to  her why I was angry. That I could explain to her how the way her face had  dropped—as though it was <em>her </em>I was  turning down—had been enough to send me on a pseudo-murderous rampage.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I never did pay close attention to  the things that were closest to me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Never.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you turning down a boy  you’ve never met without meeting him? Is it because you don’t want a  boyfriend?” she said. “Or do you have somebody…” a pause, as though steeling  herself, and then: “somebody you like already?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It occurred to me that I didn’t.  Not really; I had never been a person to  dream about boys <em>or </em>girls in my spare  time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even the people I had dated, what  few of them there were; they had all stopped calling when it came down to the  inevitable question: <em>I was thinking about  you; were you thinking about me? </em>And I would have to answer <em>no, no I wasn’t, </em>and I could never  explain to them that it wasn’t that I didn’t like them, I did; just that I  could never…never really<em> dream </em>like  they could.  And then they would hang up  the phone, and I would never see them again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just like that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t,” I said quietly.  “And I’m not seeing anyone, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  can’t tell her.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why, Chie?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  can’t tell her. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  looked away. Looked at the grass, the grass aflame with orange from the  sunset.  Suddenly it didn’t look inviting  anymore; it looked harsh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chie?” it was almost a plea this  time. <em>Don’t look at the grass, Chie.  Look at… </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  looked at her.  She looked happier  immediately, but still troubled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If  you’re going to hurt her because you don’t want to hurt her, aren’t you just  being redundant </em>and <em>stupid? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was, and I knew it.  And two things I was  not were redundant and stupid.  I hoped.  “I was angry because of the way you  looked.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She looked a little startled, but I  pressed onward anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was angry because you looked  heartbroken when you saw the card.” <em>Not when she saw the card. When you looked  at the card like that.  Like it was  something dirty. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  couldn’t have been true.  Where did I get  that from? I was looking at the card, not her. Stupid. <em>Stupid. </em>“I was angry because  I didn’t want anybody to hurt you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She took a moment to digest this,  maybe, and then relaxed and smiled a little. A sad smile, perhaps, but a smile. She looked a little like she was  composing herself. Maybe she was.  When  she had, she said, “Okay.  We can go  now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I smiled as best as I could at her;  she still looked depressed, and that depressed me.  We started walking again, my hand still  grasping hers, almost as tightly as hers grasped mine.  It was probably going to leave a bruise, but  I let it pass. After a second, I started rubbing the back of her hand with my  thumb; whether this was to comfort her or me, I’ll probably never know.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It never really mattered, anyway.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The path got steeper the closer we  got to the plateau that overlooked the ocean, and the forest got even more  breathtaking. The bark of the trees became a full orange rather than a mix of  yellow and brown from the sun, the further the sun set, and the grass, which  didn’t look nearly so harsh as it had before, looked almost fluid as the wind  played over it like an instrument, enticing it gently, making it seem almost  musical.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A couple of times, I asked Aoi if  she was okay with the hill.  She had  pushed herself pretty hard today, running that mile. She looked a little  breathless, and I could feel her sweating into my palm—<em>blasted lesbians and their sweat glands</em>, I thought with a grin—but  she always smiled as best she could and shrugged it off. Shrugged <em>me </em>off. She was in her own world as much  as I had been in mine earlier.  Was I  really allowed to be bothered by that?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was anyway. I wanted her to tell  me what the matter was; I was worried about her, and I couldn’t shake this  feeling I had in the pit of my stomach any more than I could place it. Maybe  people are never really capable of understanding their own feelings and  reactions.  Maybe the only real judge  they have to determine their feelings with is their actions; a person can sit  around and declare that he will take a bullet for his love. Maybe he’ll honestly  believe it, too; but when the time comes for him to make good on his promise,  he might still run the other way, leaving only a thin stream of piss as a  memorial to the feeling he really thought he had.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe that was why I hated just  sitting around and thinking. Maybe that was why I was unhappy; because, after replacing  “sitting” with “trudging up a hill,” that was exactly what I was doing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But that was the thing about  trudging up a hill and thinking.  You  couldn’t stop.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  is she thinking? </em>I would wonder. <em>What  is she feeling? Why does she have that look on her face? Like she wants to cry,  but refuses to admit it? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> I  don’t want you to cry, Aoi.  Not  ever. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> That’s  why I have to reject this boy.  And the  boy after. And the boy after.  Until… </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> But  why should that matter? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe  there was something to be said for trudging up a hill and thinking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Until  what? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We  stopped.  Or rather, she stopped, and I  nearly pulled her to the ground, so lost was I in my own world, again.  I really <em>wasn’t </em>allowed to be bothered by hers, I guess. “We’re almost there,” Aoi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The world came flooding back to me,  all at once:  I was standing at the very  peak of the hill, not a hundred meters, down a curved path that I couldn’t see  the end of, from the plateau.  If you  looked out and through the trees, you could see the ocean, sparkling through the  woods like stars through a cloudy sky. There was a bench and a sign: <em>overlook plateau, 100m </em>and an arrow  helpfully indicating that people should continue following the same path they  had just killed themselves on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The grass was crunchier here; more  easily breakable.  Aoi looked at me  intently, and I said, “Are you sure you want to go through with this? I can go  by myself, you know. If you really want.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She more or less ignored me.  She spoke quickly, as though she wanted to  get everything she had to say out at once, as though it was potentially the  last moment she had to say it in.  “Chie,”  she said.  “If the person over there  really is…really is someone you love, I don’t want you to turn them down just  because of me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There isn’t any—” I started to say.  It sounded pointless all of a sudden.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please,” she whispered.  “If you love somebody, you shouldn’t let  anything stop you. They’re submitting themselves for your judgment.  Promise me you won’t hurt them <em>and </em>yourself, if that is really what it  is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her eyes were sparkling with  tears.  I couldn’t hurt her like this,  now. <em>Even  if it means hurting her later</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was funny.  Even with that train of thought so constant,  I never figured it out, right till the end. “I promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled, and let go of my hand;  the emptiness on my palm seemed to spread through my entire body, and I smiled  at her as best I could through an enormous gulp. My throat didn’t seem to want  to work properly. “Well then.  Shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She nodded, and we started walking.  I couldn’t stop glancing over at her, but she looked calmer now; more detached,  maybe.  Or maybe more focused.  It was tough to tell with her sometimes; she  was serious, but she was carefree, too. She was just about everything, all at once. I was so intent that I  actually tripped over a protruding root on the path, and only her sudden hand  on my shoulder saved me from arriving at what was either going to be my first  date or my first murder with bloody, scratched-up hands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then, suddenly, the plateau opened  up in front of my eyes.  All at once, it  was just <em>there</em>: A huge, circular  section of dirt and fallen leaves in the middle of the trees; just like the  path but for one major difference: There were no trees between us and the ocean  anymore, and for just a moment, the sun—now a burning red on the horizon—transfixed  me utterly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was nobody there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I wanted to curse. I actually  dropped to a squat, because I didn’t feel like my legs could hold the bulk of  the rage that was rapidly building up inside of me.  I wanted to scream and curse and rave and  tear down a fucking tree with my bare fucking hands and ram it down the  fucker’s gullet and</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He’s not here.  The little-…he’s not here,” I said.  “We were looking for him <em>all this time </em>and he—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s a reason he’s not here,” Aoi  said throatily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked up at her, and she walked out into  the middle of the plateau, tears brimming in her eyes.  And then, all at once, it made sense to  me.  Not just the letters and the looks  from today, but every single look she’d given me for the past three years. Every  inadvertent touch.  Everything.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It had all been right in front of my  face, just like the grass. And still, I had looked right past it.  And that was the last thing, I realized, that  I wanted to do.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But still, I had to hear it from  her. I straightened up and looked her straight in the eye.  “Tell me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled a little, and the tears  that had been welling up started to trace little wet lines down the smooth skin  of her cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wrote the letters.” She <em>ran ahead and planted the third letter when  I was talking with Mai.  She probably had  Mai plant the second letter. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I started walking towards her, my  legs carrying me as though it were the most important thing in the world all of  a sudden.  I think it was.  I think they wouldn’t have stopped even if  you had severed them from my torso entirely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wrote them because it was the  only way I could think of doing…doing this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was halfway to her.  I couldn’t let her do what she was about to  do.  She was about to break down, and  then she’d never be able to</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> say  it. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chie…because  I really…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was there, and I threw myself into  her arms with as much might as I could muster.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She stopped speaking for a moment,  and I knew it was because she couldn’t as hot tears started to soak into my  shirt.  I hugged her tight, using one  hand to press her head into me, using the other to rub her back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After a second, I relaxed my arms,  and she pulled back.  She had the same  look that she’d had before, as we stared at each other in silence, as her lips  had tried and failed, I think, to say it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So she said it now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  smiled, and I think it was the  most honest smile I had ever shown in my life. “I love you,” I echoed,  and then I glanced at her lips. They were doing something again, but it  wasn’t mouthing words. And she was  getting closer again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Boys  never go more than ninety percent when they want to kiss a girl.  Girls should be allowed the final ten, so as  to avoid bruised cheekbones. </em>Somebody  I had gone on a date with once had told me that, as a joke; but I think he was  being honest, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But I wasn’t ten percent of  anything.  So I kissed her.  I kissed her deeply, finding her lips small  but warm, pressing into mine with the same urgency I had heard in her voice  just a few minutes before. Like this could be the last moment of her life, and  so she had to live it as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It wasn’t the last moment, though.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It wasn’t the last kiss,  either.  There were many, many more after  that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was dark by the time we finally  made it to the base of the mountain.  I  think that alone is proof enough.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I think we found what we were  looking for. Maybe we never even knew what that was, but I think we found  it.  Both of us, at once.  And that, I think, is the most anybody can  ever say.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I see everything that goes on at  this school.  But I don’t see a lot of  things, too. It’s impossible to see everything. I’m not just the Reliable Source. I never was.  I was a loyal, caring  friend.  Now I’m also a loyal, caring lover.  I’ve requested and been granted permission to have Aoi move in with me after  the summer recess ends.  The  administration was more than happy to comply.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I still visit that mountain, even  now, when I have no reason to be anywhere near Fuuka academy.  Sometimes Aoi comes with me, sometimes she  doesn’t.  I’ve marked off the tree she  put the letter on, and I visit it every time, and I carve some new words into  it with a little hammer and nail.  I  think people read it, but I’m not sure. I hope so.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Because there are some words that have  more influence than others; words that come in unexpected places can impact our  lives more than words we see every day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe that’s why I still write  there. Maybe that’s why I still compose words onto those trees.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe.</span></p>
