<p>One Step Closer</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  many months that followed Shizuru and my abrupt separation were quite  busy, which was probably for the better so I wouldn’t be dwelling on my  brown eyed friend or the distance I had forced between us. Sure she had  slapped me, but I didn’t take it personally. I wasn’t mad at her  either, but it sure did shock me when it happened though. Shizuru  didn’t seem like the type to be emotionally impulsive like that, at  least not from what I had gathered in the time we had spent together.  She was always so calm and serene in any situation…Could me pushing her  away upset her that badly? How was that? It wasn’t like I was anyone  special…I wasn’t even worthy of her friendship.
<p>Even though I wasn’t  acting like it, I still considered Shizuru to be my friend. I always  considered her to be my friend, my only one actually. Nothing would  change that. Even if we never spoke to each other again, which I  sincerely hoped wouldn’t be the case, she would always hold a very dear  place in my heart. I hoped, prayed really, that one day when all this  First District and Hime stuff was over with and out of the way that  we’d be able to pick up where we left off. But I didn’t know if that  time would ever come, or when it finally did, if I would even be alive.</p>
<p>Needless  to say, I continued looking into the First District, gathering  information from both Yamada and some other sources that I had hired.  We were still slowly crawling closer and closer to the organization,  but we certainly had a ways to go, not to mention that there were quite  a few major pieces of the puzzle still missing. To say that it wasn’t  frustrating would be a complete lie, but the little steps we were  taking managed to keep me sane.</p>
<p>One thing that wasn’t helping my  sanity was school. Studying for my end of term exams was stressful,  especially since it was being piled on top of all the other things I  had going on. I did, however, put it as my top priority for the time  being. I couldn’t afford to get behind another year in school… that  would just be flat out embarrassing. Well, not just embarrassing, but  it would also look bad on my part. Even though I was currently dealing  with the First District and other things that were totally off the  wall, a part of me still continued to cling on to the slight hope that  one day I would resume a normal life. And if I was to have a normal  life, a good education was important. I think that was my main  motivation when it came to my schooling. I would squeeze by, even if it  nearly killed me in the process.</p>
<p>During this time, Shizuru and I  didn’t talk too much. We didn’t talk at all really. Every now and then  we’d run into each other at school, merely exchanging awkward hellos  and the occasional wave. She always smiled though, that same sweet  smile, but something seemed…off. I could usually read how she was  feeling no matter what kind of mask she had on to hide her true  emotions, but lately I noticed that it was becoming more difficult to  do so. Granted the times we did see each other were quite brief, but  still…Had she changed that much since I was last around her? It wasn’t  totally out of the question, but it certainly did trouble me, which is  probably why I was currently trying to hunt her down.</p>
<p>It was a  Friday morning, the bell had already rung and I should have been in my  first period class, but instead I was hanging around the high school  girl’s locker room waiting for a certain brunette to appear from the  doorway. I remained out of sight as I watched one after the other of  Shizuru’s classmates leave the changing room. When she finally emerged,  I was quick to make my presence known, turning the corner to lean  against the wall, arms crossed.</p>
<p>“You sure did take you’re sweet time in there.”</p>
<p>“It’s  my job as class representative to be the last one out,” she began as  she waved a small key in the air, “I have to lock the door.”</p>
<p>“I  see,” I simply responded, hanging on to every slight deviation of her  strong Kyoto accent. It had been such a long time since I’d heard her  soothing voice…Was it possible to miss it <em>this</em> much?</p>
<p>“So  why has Natsuki graced me with her presence this Friday morning? After  such a long time…” Shizuru continued, turning her back to me to place  the key in the knob.</p>
<p>“It’s about that actually…”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>The familiar <em>‘thunk’</em> of the lock sounded, breaking the silence before she turned to face me  once again. Since the weather had warmed up, the high school P.E.  classes were now currently swimming during that period. Shizuru was  adorned in the typical blue one-piece swimsuit, along with her blue and  white Fuuka Academy jacket that she left open. She also carried a small  tote bag with her, which I assumed contained the usual swimming  necessities.</p>
<p>This was the first time I had seen Shizuru  so…exposed, for lack of a better term. Her skin was lightly tanned from  spending many class periods outside. She was curvier than I was, a  perfect hourglass shape. She…had a <em>nice</em> body. Shizuru was in  decent shape, granted she wasn’t as conditioned as me, but I sincerely  doubted that many girls our age were. Not that I expected her to be. It  wasn’t like she had a reason to, plus I don’t think most girls aimed  for the whole toned-muscle look. This just proved once again that  Shizuru was quite the opposite of me; she was soft and sensual, and  absolutely stunning, something you couldn’t entirely perceive when you  simply saw her in her school uniform.</p>
<p>“Ara…Natsuki looking at me  so intently is making me blush…” the crimson-eyed girl playfully  teased, pulling her jacket together at the chest and successfully  snapping me out of my daze.</p>
<p>“W-What?! N-No!”</p>
<p>My long lost friends red cheek one and red cheek two returned. It seemed we were slipping into our same old routine already.</p>
<p>Shizuru’s familiar chuckling tickled my ears and I couldn’t help but smile slightly, “So, I assume you’ve been well?”</p>
<p>“As well as one can be, I suppose. And you?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been alright.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad to hear that.”</p>
<p>I pushed myself off the wall, squaring up to her yet maintaining the same distance, “Hey, Shizuru?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“<em>We’re</em> okay…right?”</p>
<p>“Whatever does Natsuki mean?”</p>
<p>I looked deeply into her crimson eyes.</p>
<p><em>You know what I mean.</em></p>
<p>She let out a small sigh, tilting her head slightly, “I would like to think so. What about you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I just…wanted to make sure is all…”</p>
<p>At that, she smiled her genuine smile, <em>my</em> smile, “Then that’s that.”</p>
<p>She paused for a moment, her smile fading, “Although I would like to apologize for the last time we talked…I—“</p>
<p>I knew what she was implying immediately.</p>
<p>“Mmh, no, don’t worry about it. I wish you had hit me harder actually,” I added with a laugh.</p>
<p>A familiar devious smirk, “Alright then.”</p>
<p>“H-Huh?”</p>
<p>Before  I could even react, Shizuru was right in front of me. I watched as she  reared her arm back, and I instinctively shut my eyes anticipating the  impending strike. However it wasn’t a painful smack that came, instead  it was a pair of warm and slightly wet lips quickly pecking me on the  cheek. My hand immediately shot up to the spot.</p>
<p>“Hey!” I yelled  at her as she pranced away, giggling like a child with a victorious  little grin on her face. I could feel my face reddening, “Shizuru!”</p>
<p>“I should really be off to class now, and so should Natsuki, ne?” she practically singed.</p>
<p>Defeated yet again, I waved her off, “Bah! Fine...Baka!”</p>
<p>“Goodbye, Natsuki!”</p>
<p>I  watched as the girl trotted off to catch up with her classmates, my  angered expression losing out to a small smile as I stood there simply  reveling in the fact that Shizuru and my friendship was still quite  intact, albeit on a small level, even after all this time.</p>
<p>And for now, that was all that I needed to know.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em><strong>Splash!</strong></em>
<p>“Wow, good job Miss Fujino, that’s been the best time for the entire class all week!”</p>
<p>As I emerged from the water, I heard my teacher profess this, which in turn triggered a quiet eruption of <em>‘oohs’ </em>and <em>‘aahs’</em> from my fellow classmates who were watching her write down my lap time.</p>
<p>A happy little grin spread across my face.</p>
<p><em>How could I not have the best time after just seeing my Natsuki? And I stole a kiss from her on top of that…</em></p>
<p>Well,  to solely credit my astounding time to my elation of being with Natsuki  earlier wouldn’t be completely correct. Lately it seemed that my body  was…stronger, more athletic, than usual. It was strange. I hadn’t been  doing anything different…and I hadn’t changed my diet at all, not that  I ate much junk food anyways. I did exercise here and there when I got  the chance, but I hadn’t been increasing my time any. The only thing  that was different about me was a small red mark that had appeared on  my left side right above my hip. I didn’t know where it came from; it  practically sprung up overnight a few months ago from what I could  tell. Was it a cut or a burn? No, it didn’t hurt when I touched it. A  birth mark maybe? That was out of the question since it had <em>just</em> appeared. I tried scraping at it, but nothing happened. It was like a  tattoo imbedded into my skin, and there was nothing I could do about  it. Not knowing what it was or where it came from, I simply chose to  ignore it for the time being since it wasn’t causing me any harm, but I  would certainly keep my eye on it.</p>
<p>As I pulled myself out of the pool, I heard a distinctive <em>‘humph’</em> from above me. I looked up to see a sturdy blonde-haired girl peering down at me, hands crossed over her chest.</p>
<p>“I didn’t take you for a swimmer, Fujino.”</p>
<p>Suzushiro  Haruka, daughter of the man who built our very school. She was  loudmouthed and hotheaded, and could get relatively annoying in a very  short amount of time, but for the most part, I didn’t have a problem  with her. She, however, seemed to have a problem with me as of late,  which was probably on account of our running against each other for  President of the Student Council.</p>
<p>“I’m not, Suzushiro-san. I suppose I just got lucky today,” I replied as calm as ever, like what I had done was nothing special.</p>
<p><em>That should do it…</em></p>
<p>I  watched her eyes flare and twitch slightly as her mouth contorted into  a small frown. I could practically see the steam shooting out of her  ears as she stormed off in her boorish manner. Irritating Haruka was  just about as easy as teasing Natsuki, granted it wasn’t nearly as fun,  but it would do for now.</p>
<p>Walking over to one of the covered  benches, I opened my bag and took out my towel to begin drying off. It  is about at this time when a group of my classmates quickly surrounded  me.</p>
<p>“What did Suzushiro-san say to you, Fujino-san? Something  mean?” one of the girls inquired, whispering behind her hand as she  glanced over at the blonde in question.</p>
<p>“Nothing out of the ordinary,” I replied as I continued removing the water from my body.</p>
<p>“Rumor has it you’re going to slaughter her in the elections, there’s no doubt she’s heard it too,” another girl piped in.</p>
<p>“That  might be true,” I began as I sat down, removing my swimming cap to  release my tousles of light brown hair, “but I guess we’ll just have to  wait and see.”</p>
<p>“Everybody already knows you have the position, nobody’s dumb enough to put <em>her</em> in charge.”</p>
<p>“Ara, that’s a cruel thing to say…Miss Suzushiro seems like a very hard worker to me.”</p>
<p>“I’m  sorry for sounding harsh, Fujino-san, and it may be true that  Suzushiro-san is very determined because her father built the school,  but that doesn’t mean we want her as our Seitokaichou. You’ll fulfill  the role much better.”</p>
<p>A collective agreement sounded throughout  the group of girls causing a small smile to form on my face, “Thank  you. I hope you’re right.”</p>
<p><em>I’ve never thought of it that way…Suzushiro-san just might come in handy…</em></p>
<p>Before  my brain could continue it’s plotting, my thoughts were interrupted by  the screeching whistle of my teacher, her voice commanding us to head  back inside. Grabbing my bag, I began walking back towards the school.</p>
<p><em>This could work out even better than I thought.</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Before  I knew it, my last year of middle school was over. I had survived,  which meant that I would be beginning my high school career in a couple  of weeks. The Student Council elections were also being held around  this time, late compared to most schools, but occurring nonetheless. I  usually didn’t bother with such trivial things, but when I saw the list  of the candidates that view quickly changed. Why? Because there was one  Fujino Shizuru on that sheet…And she was one of the two candidates  running for President.
<p>On the first day of the new school year, I  awoke and immediately went to my closet, removing the new uniform I was  to wear, a welcome change from the adolescent sailor outfit I had  become accustomed to. Unzipping the cloth protector, I peered down at  the orangey-yellow jacket on my bed. Unbuttoning the jacket, I removed  it from the hanger to reveal the white blouse we were to wear  underneath. Snarling slightly, I threw the thing to the other side of  the bed before returning to my closet, taking out my white long sleeved  hooded shirt. I slipped the thing on before shrugging into my jacket,  deciding to leave it unbuttoned. After I pulled on my tan skirt, a pair  of gray socks and my tennis shoes, I downed a quick bowl of cereal  before grabbing my helmet and brown leather school bag and heading out  the door.</p>
<p>I sat through class after class totally and perpetually  bored. I don’t really know why I felt like I needed to be here on the  first day, it wasn’t like anything ever happened, but then again it was  probably a good idea to confirm to my teachers that I was indeed on  their roll sheet.</p>
<p>I skipped lunch to go on a little joyride on my  bike. I had been feeling antsy spending all day inside, so it certainly  felt good to go out and get some fresh air. <em>Unfortunately</em> I got  back a tad bit late and ended up missing my last few classes of the  day, and to make up for that, I spent the rest of the afternoon  lounging under my usual tree. It was right outside my classroom so I  could hear the lessons…Well, I would have if I had chose to actually  pay attention.</p>
<p>At the sound of the bell, I waited until the main  wave of students came rushing out of the school before venturing  inside, making my way to the second floor. The door to the student  council room was already open when I approached. It didn’t appear that  anyone else was there, and when I peeked inside the door I only  confirmed this. The only figure was a certain chestnut-haired girl  currently sitting at the desk in the front of the room, sipping a cup  of tea while gazing at the screen of her laptop.</p>
<p>I leaned against  the doorframe, quietly watching her for a moment. The girl was clad in  a new colored uniform to show her position as Kaichou, a tan jacket and  a dark gray skirt, but she sported it just as amazingly as she had the  old one. I honestly doubt that anyone in the school could look as good  in our uniform as Shizuru did. She just had a way of looking beautiful  no matter what she was wearing. I took in the sight before finally  making my presence known.</p>
<p>“Congratulations on being elected, Shizuru.”</p>
<p>She  gasped at the initial sound of my voice, turning her head to look at me  before changing her slightly shocked expression back into her usual  placid one, “Thank you, Natsuki.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’ve been hearing  that all day, huh?” I questioned as I made my way further inside,  taking a seat on top of the desk.</p>
<p>“True, but to hear it come from Natsuki is what makes me truly happy.”</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes at her as I continued, “Seriously though, I never would have taken you for one striving for power.”</p>
<p>“Ara, why is it that everyone attributes that to me?” Can I not simply want to help and be involved with my school?”</p>
<p>“Well, anyway, it is certainly better than having that bossy blonde in charge, but...”</p>
<p>“Hmm? What?”</p>
<p>“Eh…it’s nothing,” I replied.</p>
<p><em>But maybe this seems a little unlike you…</em></p>
<p>Sure,  Shizuru had been a class representative last year, but that was  something entirely different from being President of the Student  Council. She was now the most powerful and influential student in the  school, and along with that came a lot of work and responsibility. Not  that she couldn’t handle it, I guess I just couldn’t understand why  she, or anyone for that matter, would want to do it.</p>
<p>The crimson-eyed girl must have noticed my internal debate as she interrupted my thoughts with her sweet Kyoto-ben.</p>
<p>“How  about we think about more important things? Such as the fact that the  Seitokaichou’s access to the school’s intranet is quite superior to  that of a regular student for instance…”</p>
<p>My heart jumped in  excitement at her words before they really began to sink in, causing me  to stiffen as my eyes widened, “No…it can’t be…Shizuru, you didn’t…just  because I said…”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” she asked me, head tilting to the side ever so slightly.</p>
<p>“I…well…because I said I wanted to investigate…about the school,” I managed to mumble out.</p>
<p>The initial response I received was completely unexpected.</p>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>Fujino  Shizuru laughed out loud, and I mean really laughed, something totally  not in character for the Kyoto native. At least not the one I knew.</p>
<p>“Sh-Shizuru!”</p>
<p>She  waved one hand at me while the other attempted to stop her laughter,  “Gomen…I’m sorry, but for Natsuki to say such a thing…so amusing…”</p>
<p>I merely squinted at her until she finally regained control of herself enough to continue.</p>
<p>“It is true that I will do many things for Natsuki, but to bear the weight of Seitokaichou is a little much, ne?”</p>
<p>“Well, y-yeah…”</p>
<p>“This  is something I chose to do on my own, a challenge of sorts. Besides, it  will help when applying for college and work as well, so Natsuki  shouldn’t worry about using my position for her needs if it is readily  available to her.”</p>
<p>Standing, Shizuru took a step away from her  chair and motioned for me to sit. I eyed her warily at first, but after  she reassured me with a nod and a smile I consented. Scooting up a  little, I stared at Shizuru’s new toy. Would I really be able to find  my answers with this? I surely hoped so, or at least, I hoped it would  help me get closer to the answers I sought or the people who had them.</p>
<p>“Let me enter the password, it’ll only take a moment.”</p>
<p>Shizuru  leaned forward, her arms stretching over my shoulders to reach the  keyboard. I could feel her soft breasts press into my back, but I was  far too preoccupied with the laptop to think twice about it.</p>
<p>“There. The password is fuuka1219. You can remember that, can’t you?” her voice whispered into my ear.</p>
<p>“Mmh,” came my speedy response.</p>
<p>“Then it’s all yours. Take your time, I just have some paper work to do for now,” she stated, straightening in posture.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Shizuru.”</p>
<p>Before  the girl walked off, I could have sworn I felt a soft, stealthily quick  pressure on the top of my head. I didn’t even notice Shizuru move until  I saw her sit down at one of the other tables in the room and pull out  a stack of papers to busy herself with for I was too engrossed with the  screen flashing with names, words and numbers.</p>
<p><em>Finally…just a little while longer, mother. I will find the ones responsible for your death…I promise.</em></p>
