<p><strong>Chapter Notes:</strong></p>
<p>1. Students at Garderobe are Corals for two years (age 15 &amp; 16) and Pearls for two years (age 17 &amp; 18).</p>
<p>2.  The GEMs belonging to the Five Columns are passed down to the next  recipient who is to take the current owner’s place. However, they do go  through some slight alterations to sync with the new user, which causes  the change in robe and element.</p>
<p>3. The Shinso narrows down the  best candidates for possible Columns for each graduating class, but  ultimately the final decision is still left to the current Five Columns  themselves.</p>

“Where is she?”
<p>Shizuru Viola had just arrived back at Garderobe Academy only a few  minutes ago, her first destination being the Pearl’s dorm rooms to  congratulate her younger friend on her graduation and to apologize for  not being present at the ceremony, only to find that the dark-haired  girl was no where to be found, the room itself looking gravely desolate  on both sides. Immediately, she had rushed to the Gakuenchou’s office,  bursting through the door without warning, much unlike her usual self,  and nearly smearing the name of the <em>Graceful Amethyst </em>in the process.</p>
<p>Heated  ruby eyes burned in the direction of the Column who had her back turned  to her younger equal as she gazed out the giant windows that comprised  the wall near her desk, hands clasped behind her.</p>
<p>“Where is she?” Shizuru pressed again, a sense of urgency in her words, tone daring to deepen dangerously.</p>
<p>“…The  letter actually arrived the day before graduation,” Lucretia began,  eerily calm, “but I chose to keep it from her until the ceremony was  over…”</p>
<p>Pausing, the Headmistress allowed her head to sink, “It seems that things are getting worse over there…”</p>
<p>Shizuru could feel her body tense at the words. Her lip trembled.</p>
<p>“They called her back.”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em><strong>Two years ago…</strong></em>
<p><em>She couldn’t wait; she just had</em><em> to tell Natsuki the good news now. </em></p>
<p><em>Shizuru  had managed to maintain her ever-calm presence, only sharing her  excitement with the little voice in her head, even as Headmistress  Oleander informed her of the decision the Five Columns had made about  who should replace Norah Ackart as the owner of the Bewitching Smile  Amethyst. After everything that one could possibly fathom about the  position had been covered and confirmed, the group of five respectable  women had congratulated her and sent her back to her room.</em></p>
<p><em>Well, that is to say, it would have been her room, but she had to make a quick detour first.</em></p>
<p><em>She  gracefully sauntered down the hall, saying her ‘hellos’ and ‘good  evenings’ to the girl’s who passed by, but once she arrived at her  designated door, she hastily knocked on the wooden structure, hoping to  awaken some kind of stirring within.</em></p>
<p><em>She could hear a low  grumble followed by the sound of the legs of a chair scooting across  the wood flooring, and Shizuru couldn’t help but childishly giggle  despite her eighteen years. </em></p>
<p>“<em>What is it?” a voice rudely mumbled, and as soon as the door was barely cracked open, Shizuru pounced.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Natsuki!”  the tawny-haired girl practically squealed as she threw her arms around  the younger Coral who stumbled backward but somehow managed to catch  her footing, keeping them both upright.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Sh-Shizuru Onee-sama…?”</em></p>
<p><em>Loosening  her grip, Shizuru leaned back enough so the two girls could look each  other in the eyes, “I did it! I was chosen to become one of the next  Columns!”</em></p>
<p>“<em>That’s grea—huh!” Natsuki tried to say, but was  promptly pulled back into another tight hug, her face forcefully  pressing against the older girl’s ample bosom causing her to blush  fiercely even though similar occurrences had happened quite often over  the past few years.</em></p>
<p><em>Giving her one last tight squeeze,  Shizuru finally released the wriggling girl in her arms who promptly  harrumphed and straightened her disheveled uniform.</em></p>
<p>“<em>So if  you’re becoming a Column, then what about your father? Weren’t you  going to serve as his Otome like your Onee-Sama is to hers?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Father  will find a new Otome to serve him if he wishes,” Shizuru replied as  she sat down on Natsuki’s bed, the younger girl doing the same soon  after.</em></p>
<p>“<em>What made you change your mind?”</em></p>
<p><em>Shizuru remained silent, her eyes narrowing in concentration before a mischievous grin graced her features, “Natsuki did.”</em></p>
<p><em>Instantly, the raven-haired girl’s eyes widened, “Wh-What?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>You  were the one who showed me how important freedom is. By becoming one of  the Five Columns, I won’t be tied down by a human contact, I’ll only  have one with the Shinso,” the older girl honestly answered, even if it  wasn’t the whole truth. </em></p>
<p><em>But how could she fully say what was within her heart?</em></p>
<p><em>How could she openly say to the girl beside her, ‘It’s because I want to be with you’?</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
She should have gone back to the guest room where she usually stayed, but she didn’t.
<p>She should have gone <em>anywhere</em> else, but her feet still led her to this place whether she was consciously thinking about it or not.</p>
<p>Shizuru  sat on the bed of that dark room without a word, lifelessly staring  straight ahead at the adjacent wall. It was familiar, she herself had  lived in a perfectly identical room to this one all four years she had  attended Garderobe, but familiarity was supposed to be comforting, and  this was anything but.</p>
<p>Idly, she grazed her fingertips over the soft pink material of the bedcover before fisting it in her palm.</p>
<p>“…Natsuki…”</p>
<p>Finally…Finally,  Shizuru allowed herself release, letting the tears that had been  collecting in her crimson eyes run freely down her cheeks as she buried  her face in her hands.</p>
