  <p>Plus Two  to Dexterity</p>
  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
  P.E. and I, our  relationship could purely be described in one way: love-hate.
  <p>It was my favorite  class of the day. No, in fact, it was the only period that I can  honestly say that I enjoyed. I’ve always been athletic, I guess  it’s in the genes or something; not my parent’s though,  grandparents maybe, but certainly not the mother or father who  preferred to stick their noses in a text book over any form of  physical activity on any given day. My Hime powers only enhanced my  already god-given abilities so when it came to class activities I was  the top of the class…or at least I would have been if I actually  attended every day. Anyway, I was good at no matter what our coach  had us doing, and on top of that I was getting some decent exercise  so there was no reason for me to hate P.E…except for the fact that  my classmates were there, and by classmates I mainly meant the boys  who thoroughly enjoyed staring at me no matter what outfit we were  having to wear for the day. Because of this, my uncanny ability to  ignore people only grew, and oh how it grew…I do believe that it  had come to be one of my greatest talents, and I was exerting it at  full force right at this very moment.</p>
  <p>I  had just completed my laps for the day, in record time I might add,  pulling myself out of the Olympic sized pool when the comments and  the glares began. I immediately switched over to<em>‘deaf-tunnel-vision-mode’ </em>as  I quickly dried myself off before striding towards the locker room.  There was no point in being exposed like this for longer than needed,  so I sought the shelter of the school’s walls with eager haste.</p>
  <p>I could hear the  constant low murmur of chatter from the girls inside before I  entered, so I was sure to slip in as quietly as possible. I usually  didn’t have too much trouble with my female classmates, aside from  them being their overly giddy and talkative selves, so usually I just  had to deal with them trying to involve me in their conversations.  That could be dealt with easily enough, however, by a simple glare or  a series of one-word answers, sometime both if I was in a  particularly cross mood. Luckily today didn’t seem to be one of  those days, so I continued on to my locker without any interruptions  and proceeded to dry my hair with my towel.</p>
  <p>And then, suddenly, my  nice peaceful little day shattered to pieces.</p>
  <p>“It’s gone. My  bra,” one of the girls stated.</p>
  <p>“No way, mine too,”  I heard Akane follow, sounding just as shocked.</p>
  <p>Several other girls  seemed to have fallen under the same predicament due to the chorus of  similar baffled exclamations that erupted soon after.</p>
  <p><em>It’s one of the  few times I come to class, and this happens.</em></p>
  <p>Standing, I opened my  own locker and peered inside.</p>
  <p><em>What a lame  tale…Eh?!</em></p>
  <p><em>No…No, that  couldn’t be right. </em></p>
  <p>I blinked and looked  again. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Steel. Just silver steel. My eye  twitched on its own accord.</p>
  <p><em>How could…I mean,  the other girls I can understand, but no one’s brave enough to pull  this kind of stupid prank with me…right?</em></p>
  <p>Apparently there was in  fact someone who was brave enough to steal from Kuga Natsuki because  I, just like the other girls in the locker room with me, had been  rendered officially bra and panty-less. I was still staring in  disbelief of my obviously pilfered locker when Akane’s voice  brought me back to my cruel reality.</p>
  <p>“Kuga-san, were you  safe?”</p>
  <p>Quickly spinning on my  heels, I slammed my locker door shut and leaned back against it to  hide my lack of clothing, “Was what safe?”</p>
  <p>“You always wear one  that looks expensive,” the girl continued.</p>
  <p>“It’s obviously  fine,” I lied, “There’s no way I would let something like that  happen.”</p>
  <p>“That’s true,”  the brunette agreed, a smile on her face, “Kuga-san, you’re  always on the ball, so it’s only natural.”</p>
  <p>“T-that’s right.”</p>
  <p><em>Well…usually.  Dammit!</em></p>
  <p>Thankfully the  conversation ended there, allowing me to get back to my number one  priority at the moment:  figuring out what the hell I was going to do  about having no undergarments.</p>
  <p><em>Okay, just think. I  have a bathing suit, I could wear tha—er—but it’s still wet…I  really can’t believe this…I can’t just go commando all day…I  wonder if…hmm…Second period should be starting soon, which means  Shizuru will probably be in the student council room. God! I’d  never hear the end of this from that woman, but I really don’t have  a choice…Everlasting teasing or…eh, I really don’t want to  think about it… How do I always find myself in these types of  situations?!</em></p>
  <p>Choosing to go with my  first option rather than the latter, as little consolation as it  brought me, I stormed off to the stalls to change into my uniform  before placing my swimming equipment into my locker and heading out  the door.</p>
  <p>Putting my pride on the  line, and at the risk of flashing anyone who walked by, I carefully  made my way down the hallway; my hands clasped right behind my  derrière unless the unthinkable should happen.</p>
  <p><em>Right, one foot in  front of the other. Slowly, slowly…Is that the air conditioning  coming on?! Eh…I hate being on edge like this…Ah! Movement  detected!</em></p>
  <p>There was a group of  guys approaching so I quickly sidestepped to <em>“look”</em> out  the wonderfully placed window, all the while watching them out of the  corner of my eye. Once they had passed, I released a sigh of pure  relief.</p>
  <p>“If I can at least  make it to the Student Council room…” I uttered to myself before  continuing my long treacherous journey.</p>
  <p>Honestly, I don’t  know what I though Shizuru was going to do about this. But she <em>was</em> Fujino Shizuru, Seitokaichou of Fuuka Academy. If anyone could figure  out what to do, it would be her. She would come up with some kind of  plan. At least, that’s what I kept telling myself over and over  again as I continued to creep closer to the room.</p>
  <p><em>I can see the look  on her face now—!</em></p>
  <p>“K-Kuga!”</p>
  <p>I gasped and nearly  fell over at the sound of my name, but quickly recovered as I turned  to face…Masashi Takeda?</p>
  <p>“T-Takeda…”</p>
  <p>As much as I hated to  admit it, it was a pretty well known fact around the entire school  that Takeda, the captain of the kendo team, had a crush on me. Why? I  had no idea. Luckily for me we didn’t run into each other all that  often since he was two years ahead of me. He had tried to talk to me  on a few other occasions, but every time I always shot him down.  You’d think he would get a clue that <em>maybe</em> I didn’t like  him, but apparently he had taken too many strikes to the head or  something because it certainly wasn’t getting through to him.  Apparently this was going to be another one of his lame attempts to  start a conversation with me…</p>
  <p>The boy stood stiffly  at attention, refusing to actually look at me while his face  continued to turn red, “Y-yo, K-Kuga.”</p>
  <p>“W-what do you want?”  I questioned while blushing myself, making sure to keep my skirt down  with my hands.</p>
  <p>“I see you’ve come  to class today.”</p>
  <p>“What?!” I growled.</p>
  <p>Takeda twitched as he  tried to actually compose a sentence, “No, you see…the class  here…and…”</p>
  <p>“Why you…You  stopped me just to say that?” I nearly yelled, my anger quickly  rising by the second, “Move out of the way.”</p>
  <p>“W-What are you angry  about?”</p>
  <p>“I said move!” I  commanded once again.</p>
  <p>Before either of us  could say anything more, a familiar voice came ringing through the  crystal arena. A voice I really didn’t want to hear at the moment…</p>
  <p>“I have my part time  job today. You sure you can take care of the room while I’m gone?”</p>
  <p>I reluctantly turned my  head to see who I knew it would be…Tokiha Mai. And sure enough, my  fears were dead on that Minagi Mikoto would be at her side.</p>
  <p>“What’s ‘take  care of room’?” the younger girl replied to her busty  counterpart.</p>
  <p>“You really are,”  Mai began before finally waking up to what was in front of her. “Huh?  Umm…”</p>
  <p>I cringed as I watched  the dark haired HiME remove the large black case from her shoulder  and place it on the ground, her eyes filling with that same battle  lust as before.</p>
  <p><em>No…not now…not  here!</em></p>
  <p>Takeda glanced back and  forth between the two of us in the middle of a staring contest.  Mikoto began growling at me much like a cat would do as my fingers  itched. I really didn’t want to summon my element, but what choice  did I have if she decided to strike?</p>
  <p>Suddenly, Minagi  positioned herself into a fighting stance, and by instinct, I did the  same.</p>
  <p>“Hey!” Mai called  out.</p>
  <p>And then…and then…</p>
  <p>“Ah!”</p>
  <p>I hastily ceased the  fluttering of my skirt that had just proved to the world that I was  indeed a woman. I could feel the blood rush to my face  instantaneously. With my eyes tightly shut, I could only hear the  thud of that damn kendo pervert hitting the ground as he apparently  fainted.</p>
  <p><em>No, that didn’t  just happen. It couldn’t have. This is all a bad dream. A horribly  cruel, sadistic…very, very real—</em></p>
  <p>“Eeeeaaaahhhh!” my  screech radiated throughout the arena, and most likely the whole  school itself.</p>
  <p>Silence.</p>
  <p>“So I guess he got  you too,” I heard Mai state, her tone completely hysterical as she  covered her mouth with her hand.</p>
  <p>“W-What?”</p>
  <p>“The lingerie  burglar…”</p>
  <p>“S-Shut up!”</p>
  <p>“So it is true!”  the redhead proceeded to burst into a fit of laughter, the girl  beside her looking at her quizzically. Eventually she calmed herself  enough to talk again, “O-Oh…okay, just…heh…wait in the girls  bathroom. I’ll go…hm…get you something to wear. Ha ha ha!”</p>
  <p>Not having any other  choice I grunted as I stormed off towards the nearest restroom, my  hands keeping my skirt down securely, “Fine.”</p>
  <p>Once I reached the  girl’s bathroom I paced the length of the stalls back and forth,  waiting for Mai to return. It wasn’t too long before I could hear  her continued laughter down the hallway. When she burst through the  door, I immediately swiped the pair of black spandex shorts from her  hands and hurriedly locked myself in the nearest stall to put them  on. That dumb girl wouldn’t stop laughing the entire time I was  changing.</p>
  <p>“You’re laughing  too much!” I yelled, slamming the door open once I was finished.</p>
  <p>“But...Oh…Oh God,  I’m going to die from laughter,” she managed to respond, shaking  as she leaned over one of the sinks.</p>
  <p>“Shut up!”</p>
  <p>“Make sure to return  that washed, all right?”</p>
  <p>My cheeks flushed out  of anger and embarrassment, “I’ll give you a new one.”</p>
  <p>“Anyway, you owe me  one.”</p>
  <p>“I know,” I snapped  back.</p>
  <p>“Okay then, right off  the bat, I want you to pay me back.”</p>
  <p>“What do you want?”</p>
  <p>“Tell me,” Mai  began, her tone turning surprisingly serious, “What’s HiME?”</p>
  <p>I stared into her  violet eyes, and she stared right back, her gaze unwavering. Sighing,  I shook my head, “You really want to know?”</p>
  <p>“Yes,” came the  stern reply.</p>
  <p>Walking past her, I  pushed open the door, “Follow me then.”</p>
  <p>“What’s wrong with  talking here?” she questioned as she caught up to me, Mikoto close  behind and still eyeing me suspiciously.</p>
  <p>“You never know who’s  listening. We’ll talk outside.”</p>
  <p>Fortunately enough, she  obeyed and remained silent as we exited the school.</p>
  <p>I led us outside and  near the gardens out back before finally stopping, “Alright, what  is it you’re wanting to know? I don’t guarantee that I have all  the answers, but I’ll tell you what I can.”</p>
  <p>Mai sat down as she  pondered for a moment. Mikoto was quick to follow suit, and it wasn’t  long before she reclined using the redhead’s lap as a pillow.</p>
  <p>“What’s going on in  this academy?” Mai finally asked.</p>
  <p>“You’ve met the  Director, right? What did she tell you?” It wasn’t like I didn’t  already have a good guess, but I just wanted to make sure since I  hadn’t exactly met any other HiMEs who had talked to her as well.</p>
  <p>“I’m the one asking  the questions,” she replied stubbornly.</p>
  <p>“Just answer,” I  protested back.</p>
  <p>She gave in,  “Orphan...She said to fight with those monsters. She said that she  called us for that.”</p>
  <p>“You two aren’t the  only ones who were summoned like that. They haven’t been identified  yet, but there are HiMEs in this academy other than us. There are  people who are plotting to do something by gathering HiMEs. And their  objective probably isn’t to kill Orphans.”</p>
  <p>“Objective?”</p>
  <p>“Right, that’s why  I wanted to prevent any more HiMEs from gathering at the Academy,”  I answered, wanting to add a <em>‘but you two certainly didn’t  help any now, did you?’</em></p>
  <p>“I see. So, do you  still want to kick us out?” the girl continued questioning.</p>
  <p>It was certainly a  valid question, so I gave her a valid response, “Well, it can’t  be helped now that you’re here. I’ll see how things go for a  while.”</p>
  <p>“Then you don’t  have any intentions of killing us for now. Is that right?”</p>
  <p>“As long as you don’t  hinder my work.”</p>
  <p><em>And don’t speak of  what occurred earlier…</em></p>
  <p>“Okay. Got it,  Mikoto?” the dark haired girl raised herself drowsily before Mai  continued, “You don’t go fighting anymore either, got it?”</p>
  <p>“But…” the young  HiME began to protest before she was cut off.</p>
  <p>“I’ll stop making  the lunch box.”</p>
  <p>This certainly won the  redhead a drastic reaction, Mikoto forcefully nodding her  understanding with a completely petrified expression at the apparent  threat.</p>
  <p>“Got it.”</p>
  <p>I could only cock an  eyebrow as I watched their interaction.</p>
  <p>“How sad,” I  jokingly remarked as I sat down beside the pair, receiving a small  pout from the younger girl in the process.</p>
  <p>“But you’re  pitiful, too,” Mai retorted while lying down on the grass, “Do  things like this happen often at this academy?”</p>
  <p>“No way!” I hastily  shot back, “This is the first time, this lingerie burglar mess.”</p>
  <p>Suddenly Mia yelped in  surprise, and when I glanced over, the amber-eyed girl was in the  middle of groping the redhead’s ample bosom.</p>
  <p><em>What the…</em>?!</p>
  <p>“Hey, Mikoto! What  are you doing?”</p>
  <p>I could only stare on  in awkward silent perplexity.</p>
  <p><em>What’s up with  this kid?</em></p>
  <p>“Is what you have  there bra?”</p>
  <p><em>She certainly is  strange. They’re </em><em><strong>both </strong></em><em>strange… </em></p>
  <p>“Yes.”</p>
  <p><em>How is it that I get  involved with the weirdest people?</em></p>
  <p>“That disappeared?”</p>
  <p><em>And I was doing so  well about mainly keeping to myself…</em></p>
  <p>“Yeah, and panties  too.”</p>
  <p>That last statement got  me talking again though, “Shut up!”</p>
  <p>“I see, then,”  Mikoto stated as she sat up, “must be the same from earlier.”</p>
  <p>“Same?” I eagerly  questioned.</p>
  <p>“Orphan,” came her  simple reply.</p>
  <p>Both Mai and myself got  on all fours as we intently stared at the girl in disbelief. The  redhead was the first to speak, “Hey, Mikoto, that means…”</p>
  <p>“There wasn’t any  bloodlust, so I forgot about it,” came the innocent reply from the  younger girl.</p>
  <p>“Don’t forget about  it,” Mai responded, hanging her head in defeat.</p>
  <p>“Orphan…” I  muttered, already on my feet again, “I see…” My fingers dug  into my palm as they formed a fist. “I’ll make sure they get  what’s coming to them,” I vowed, shaking said fist in the air  defiantly.</p>
  <p><em>Because of that thing…Just wait you damn Orphan…just wait…</em></p>
  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
  “Ara, a lingerie  burglar, hmm? This certainly is a first.”
  <p>“Grr…Don’t <em>‘ara’</em> me, Fujino! This crisis must be delft with immediately!”</p>
  <p>“<em>Dealt</em>,  Haruka-chan.”</p>
  <p>I was currently seated  at my desk in the Student Council room, listening to the persistent  droning of the head of the Executive Committee…with the help of her  human spellchecker. Apparently someone was going around robbing the  girls at our school of their precious unmentionables, not only on the  school grounds, but also at the dorms and apparently Haruka wanted <em>me</em> to do something about it. But…I had other plans…</p>
  <p>I took a sip from my  steaming cup before setting it back on the table, “I agree,  Suzushiro-san. And I assume that the Executive Committee already has  a planned course of action?”</p>
  <p>“Eh…O-Of course!”</p>
  <p>“Just as I expected.  You’ve never let me down before, Suzushiro-san, I’m counting on  you to handle this situation with equal endeavor,” I concluded with  my trademark smile, tilting my head slightly to the side for an added  effect.</p>
  <p>“Right, just keep  drinking your tea and let <em>us</em> handle this,” the blonde  announced, swiping the folder of complaints off my desk. “Yukino,  we’re leaving!”</p>
  <p>I watched the two girls  disappear out the door before letting out a content sigh.</p>
  <p><em>Honestly, what would  I do without you, Suzushiro-san?</em></p>
  <p>Chuckling to myself, I took another sip of my tea before returning to  my previous paperwork.</p>
  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
  It was about an hour or  so later that the door to the room was slammed open, and I was  pleasantly surprised to see a certain blue-haired girl stomp in and  promptly seat herself on the edge of my desk.
  <p>“Nat…suki…? Is  something wrong?”</p>
  <p>“…It’s been a  long day…”</p>
  <p>Standing, I noticed  that the girl had what looked like dark spandex shorts on under her  skirt. It hit me immediately.</p>
  <p>“Ara…it seems that  Natsuki fell victim to the school lingerie burglar as well…”</p>
  <p>“S-shut up!” the  girl pouted, her cheeks flushing, “…I’ve been laughed at enough  today…”</p>
  <p>“Do you need to cry  on my shoulder? Or shall I just comfort you in my arms?”</p>
  <p><em>Either would be  perfectly fine with me.</em></p>
  <p>“…You’re not  helping, Shizuru,” came the not-so-thrilled reply.</p>
  <p>“Mou, Natsuki, I’m  only trying to help,” I smiled at her, which I was only rewarded  with an unconvinced glare in return.</p>
  <p>The sound of polite  coughing at the door caused us both the look in its general direction  to see two familiar faces.</p>
  <p>“Yes, Reito-san?  Tate-kun?”</p>
  <p>“Shizuru-san, we’re  not intruding, are we?” the older male asked.</p>
  <p>I stole a quick glance  at Natsuki who only huffed before looking away, “Of course not. Is  there something that you needed?”</p>
  <p>“Did you happen to  give Suzushiro-san control over the lingerie burglar matter?” the  dark haired boy continued.</p>
  <p>“Yes, in fact, I did.  Have they discovered the culprit yet?”</p>
  <p>“Takeda,” Tate  finally spoke up.</p>
  <p>“What?” Natsuki and  I both questioned, making eye contact briefly before turning our  attention back to Reito.</p>
  <p>“The Executive  Committee apprehended Takeda-kun,” the vice president took over.</p>
  <p>“Ara…” I murmured  while sitting down again.</p>
  <p>Natsuki stood, turning  her back to the two males who had made their way across the room to  sit on one of the empty tables.</p>
  <p>“It’s a false  accusation,” the emerald-eyed girl sternly protested.</p>
  <p>Her tone made me  curious, but before I could question her, Tate beat me to it.</p>
  <p>“We believe so too,  but…How can you say it with so much confidence?”</p>
  <p>“Isn’t it another  one of Suzushiro’s jumps to a conclusion?”</p>
  <p>“Why do you care so  much?”</p>
  <p>“What?”</p>
  <p>“Well, he’s my, you  know…”Reito finally decided to pipe in again, my teasing nature  seemingly having rubbed off on him a little <em>too</em> well.</p>
  <p>“NO. It’s just him  approaching me, and me…”</p>
  <p>I decided to be nice  and actually bail my friend out of her awkward position for once, but  that was mainly because it wasn’t <em>me</em> getting the cute  reaction out of her, “Well, it’s not that I’m on his side  because we’re in the same class, but I don’t think Takeda-kun is  capable of doing anything like that.”</p>
  <p>Reito smiled  mischievously, “He isn’t the type that could fulfill his desires  with lingerie. You see, he needs the contents.”</p>
  <p>Natsuki’s visible  reaction made me wonder just what <em>had</em> made her day so  horrible, especially since she quickly changed the subject.</p>
  <p>“So, what happened to  Takeda?”</p>
  <p>Reito’s visage, which  had lit up during his teasing, immediately darkened once again, “He  didn’t confess his crime to the Executive Board…”</p>
  <p>“So he was sent to  the Church,” Tate completed with a similar look.</p>
  <p>Both Natsuki’s and my  expressions quickly mirrored the boys.</p>
  <p>“Church is it?” the  raven-haired girl asked, her hand pressed against her forehead.</p>
  <p>“What a poor guy…So,  what are you planning to do now?” I inquired.</p>
  <p>“I know it’s  probably pointless,” Reito began, “but the two of us are going to  try to talk to Haruka-san about the matter.”</p>
  <p>“Good luck with  that…” Natsuki sarcastically remarked.</p>
  <p>I silently agreed with  her, but didn’t show it in the least, and decided to take the more  optimistic sounding path instead. “I don’t see any harm in  trying.”</p>
  <p>“My thoughts  exactly,” the older boy replied while standing. “Well then, since  we have your support, we’ll be on our way.”</p>
  <p>I silently nodded at  the two as they departed.</p>
  <p>After they had made it  a good ways down the hall, Natsuki grunted, “They’re just wasting  their time.”</p>
  <p>“That might be so,  but at least they’re trying to help their friend.”</p>
  <p>“Mmm…I guess…”</p>
  <p>“I would do the same  for Natsuki if she found herself in a similar situation.”</p>
  <p>“What?! I’d never  do something like this!”</p>
  <p>I chuckled at the  girl’s reaction, “I didn’t mean it like that, Natsuki. I meant  if everyone ever turned against you…I would stand by your side.”</p>
  <p>My sudden seriousness  apparently caught her off guard, “Sh-Shizuru…”</p>
  <p>“So,” I pressed on,  “what are we going to do about clearing Takeda-kun’s name?”</p>
  <p>“O-oh…umm…” the  girl uttered before slipping into a contemplative silence for several  moments. Suddenly she slammed her hand down on my desk, causing me to  blink several times at the action. Before I knew it, she was moving  away from my desk, “I’ve got to go talk to someone. It might help  with this mess. I’ll be back in a bit, alright?”</p>
  <p>“Okay, but be  careful…if you know what I mean.”</p>
  <p>“Baka!” Natsuki exclaimed, already halfway out the door.</p>
  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
  Nagi.
  <p>If anyone knew about  this Orphan, it would be that creepy little pale boy. I had to find  him, and I had to find him <em>now</em>. The problem was, I never knew  where he would show up. On a few different occasions when I was  fighting Orphans on the school grounds he would spontaneously pop up,  ramble out a few riddles at me, and disappear again. It was annoying  as hell, but I was usually too preoccupied at the moment to actually  do anything about it, although I had been successful in sending a few<em>“stray”</em> ice bullets in his general direction every now and  then. However, there was no Orphan around at the moment, and there  was also no Nagi.</p>
  <p><em>Come on, think. That  kid always has a book with him…Mmh, but I doubt that he’d risk  going to the school library…But wait…what about that other  building with the giant clock on the floor…There were books in  there too, weren’t there?</em></p>
  <p>It was the only clue I  had, so of course I immediately began heading towards the old  building. I had only been inside the eerie place once before, it’s  dimly lit interior made it hard to see since the only source of light  was coming through the windows. I wondered if it had once served as  the library for the school since I saw no other reason for the  building to be on the school grounds. But then again this <em>was</em> Fuuka Academy. Logic and reason seemingly had no presence in this  place.</p>
  <p>Making my way through  the inside of the clock building, I quietly made my way up to the  second level and was pleased to hear Nagi’s childish voice  radiating through the empty room.</p>
  <p>“…and the remaining  HiME’s are…”</p>
  <p>The sound of my  footsteps warned him of my presence, and he turned to address me.</p>
  <p>“Hey.”</p>
  <p>“I’ve been looking  for you,” I bluntly stated.</p>
  <p>“I’m so happy, to  be sought by Natsuki-chan,” the boy began, spinning around like the  little kid that he was. Or at least that he looked like, I wasn’t  entirely convinced of his child-like appearance. “Did you miss me  that much?”</p>
  <p>“Spill it. Where’s  the Orphan hiding?” I questioned in my no-nonsense tone that I had  come to use with the boy at all times, “Because of it, I was…”</p>
  <p>“Did your cute hips  catch a cold? Ouah!”</p>
  <p><em>Damn. I missed.</em></p>
  <p>I kept my recently  fired element trained on Nagi’s head even as he hung from the  railing by his frail little arms.</p>
  <p>“I’m just kidding,”  he insisted, “This is one of the types that just popped up, so I  really don’t know.”</p>
  <p>“How will they  appear? What’ll draw them out?”</p>
  <p>His childish grin  returned, “What should I do?”</p>
  <p>I shoved my pistol in  his face to…<em>hasten</em> his thinking process.</p>
  <p>“Okay, okay, I get  it,” the boy smartly continued, “You see, Orphans and Childs are  basically the same thing, right? So they have the characteristic of  being attracted to HiMEs. That means…”</p>
  <p>My eyes widened at the  sudden realization.</p>
  <p><em>Of course! Why  didn’t I think of that earlier? It’s so obvious…</em></p>
  <p>As much as I wanted to  smack myself right then and there, I didn’t have the time.  Dispersing my element, I took off at a sprint out of the building and  towards my bike. As I ran, I pulled out my cell and rapidly punched  in Shizuru’s number.</p>
  <p>“<em>Yes?”</em></p>
  <p>“Shizuru, it’s me.  I have a plan to draw out the burglar.”</p>
  <p>“<em>Natsuki? That’s  great. So what is it?”</em></p>
  <p>“All we need is to  place a lot of lingerie out and about and he should present himself  right to us.”</p>
  <p>“<em>I see…but where  are you going to get enough articles?”</em></p>
  <p>“I’m going to the  apartment to get my collection right now.”</p>
  <p>“<em>Your collection?  Ara, but I thought it was rather precious to you…”</em></p>
  <p>“It’s not like he’s  actually going to get away with it.”</p>
  <p>“<em>I suppose so.  Where are you planning to set them up?”</em></p>
  <p>“Hmm…somewhere on  campus I guess…now that school’s out, maybe we should try the  dorms?”</p>
  <p>“<em>That’s probably  the wisest choice. Do you need any help?”</em></p>
  <p>“No, I should be able  to handle it from here. You just worry about your school stuff, and  I’ll deal with this mess.”</p>
  <p>“<em>Okini, Natsuki.”</em></p>
  <p>“Alright, well, I’ll  see you later after I’ve nailed this guy.”</p>
  <p>“<em>Okay. I wish you  the best of luck.”</em></p>
  <p>“Luck? Heh, I don’t  need luck. This guy’s already in the bag.”</p>
  <p>“<em>Of course.  Goodbye.”</em></p>
  <p>“See ya.”</p>
  <p>Hanging up the phone, I chose not to waste any more time by changing  into my leather suit, and instead just threw on my helmet, straddled  my Ducati, and blazed off towards home.</p>
  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
  Was it a wise decision  to hand this case over to Natsuki? I really didn’t know. One thing  for sure, however, was that she was completely adamant about catching  the fiend, most likely because he had wronged her in the process of  satisfying his own wants and needs. This isn’t to say that I didn’t  have faith in the girl, oh quite the contrary; I knew that when  Natsuki set her mind to something that it would surely be done. The  only thing that worried me was <em>how</em> it would be done…and with  that girl, things were bound to get exciting.
  <p>Finished with my work  for the day, I packed up my laptop and set out for my dorm. When my  building first came into view, I could have sworn what appeared to be  clotheslines were strung about on one side of the structure, but I  couldn’t be for sure. Once I got closer, I confirmed what I had  previously theorized. It didn’t completely surprise me that Natsuki  had chosen to use my building. Besides, it was the only dorm building  she had actually been in from what I knew. A part of me did wonder  how she had managed to set this up in such a short amount of time,  but I decided to just dismiss the though and chuckled to myself  instead.</p>
  <p>Approaching the side  entrance, I noticed a slack-jawed Tokiha Mai frozen with bewilderment  as she stared at the newly decorated exterior of the building that  she apparently called home as well.</p>
  <p>“What the?” I heard  her mutter as I walked closer.</p>
  <p>“That’s quite a  view we have,” I stated, pausing to take a good look at it as well.</p>
  <p>“President.”</p>
  <p>“Mai-san, correct? On  your way home now?”</p>
  <p>The girl seemed a  little shocked that I was talking to her for some reason, but she  answered anyways, “Y-yes. Umm, what’s this?”</p>
  <p>“A trap like this is  useless,” a familiar harsh voice interrupted and I turned to see  Haruka storm up to us, hands on her hips in disdain. “Do you not  trust our work, President?”</p>
  <p>“Haruka-chan,”  Yukino tried to calm her friend.</p>
  <p>“It’s nothing like  that. Actually, I always give the Executive Board members all the  difficult jobs.” This seemed to break through Suzushiro’s thick  insulted skull so I continued, “I feel bad about it. That’s why I  hoped we could help some. These are all borrowed, so if any  disappear, no harm is done to the people in the dorm. Please be at  ease.”</p>
  <p>I wasn’t particularly  trying to take the credit for this plan, but somehow I thought that  Natsuki would probably prefer not being mentioned for coming up with  it. Especially if it risked her little secret being revealed to the  entire school.</p>
  <p>“I wasn’t really…”  the blonde mumbled, seeming to regret her previous outburst, if only  a little.</p>
  <p>“Camisole, petticoat,  waist nipper, garter, shape pants, bras and shorts, ah, a body suit,  too,” Yukino called out, peering through her small binoculars to  take in all that had been strung up around the building.</p>
  <p>“How did you manage  to get so much?” Mai questioned in a completely baffled tone.</p>
  <p>I simply smiled,  “Kindness from a certain connection…” Leaving it at that, I  turned to the head of the Executive committee, “Suzushiro-san.”</p>
  <p>“What is it?”</p>
  <p>“I’m counting on  you.”</p>
  <p>Haruka paused for a  moment and I thought just <em>maybe</em> she was catching on to me, but  then she returned to her usual self, “Of course. Let’s go,  Yukino.”</p>
  <p>The mousey girl simply  hummed her understanding as she trailed after her brutish companion.</p>
  <p>With that taken care  of, I turned back to my orange-haired underclassman, “Well then,  Mai-san, it was nice speaking with you again.”</p>
  <p>“O-oh, yes, you too,  Fujino Kaichou.”</p>
  <p>“Goodbye.”</p>
  <p>“Bye.”</p>
  <p>And with that, I made my way around the building and up to my room.</p>
  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
  Parking my bike in the  wooded area near the dorms, I trudged over to the building, only  pausing momentarily to take in my work. Well, I couldn’t solely  take credit for the lingerie setup. I had recruited Mikoto’s help  when I saw her walking towards the building earlier looking rather  depressed since Mai wasn’t around. Her help not only allowed her to  temporarily forget her Mai-less-ness, but it also made my job that  much easier and faster. Now that the hard part was over, all we had  to do was wait for the culprit, whom I knew was an Orphan, to come  out so I could send it to it’s utter demise.
  <p>Moving on, I bounded up  the stairs and made my way back towards the room Mai and Mikoto  shared since we had set up the trap in a way so we could use their  room as a base of operations so to speak.</p>
  <p>Knocking on the door, I  was met with a very surprised busty redhead, “K-Kuga…san?”</p>
  <p>“Oh, hey, you’re  back. Here, this is for the other pair,” I said, shoving a new pair  of spandex shorts identical to the ones she had let me borrow into  her hands. I had just bought them a few minutes ago, which was the  reason I had left the dorm in the first place. Ignoring her continued  astonished look, I let myself in, “Mikoto, have you seen anything  yet?”</p>
  <p>The dark haired HiME  who was currently crouched on top of the desk by the window shook her  head back and forth, “Nope.”</p>
  <p>“Alright, well, I’ll  take over the watch from here,” I said, peering out the window  myself.</p>
  <p>The girl was quick to  jump off and return to Mai’s side to investigate the little present  I had brought with me. The two of them conversed momentarily as I  continued to scope the area, pulling out a pair of binoculars to get  a better look.</p>
  <p>After I had checked  over my setup one last time, I finally set the binoculars down,  “Okay.”</p>
  <p>“So, why are you  here?” Mai’s voice piped in from behind me.</p>
  <p>“I’m the one that  came up with the plan. Is there a problem?” I replied, keeping my  gaze fixed outside the window.</p>
  <p>“Not exactly…”</p>
  <p>“Smaller than Mai’s,”  Mikoto chimed in.</p>
  <p>“What did you do with  that perky, uplifting one?” the redhead questioned, causing me to  actually break my concentration and peer back over my shoulder to  realize the horror of what was currently happening to a piece of my  beloved collection.</p>
  <p>“There were lots  outside.”</p>
  <p>I was quick to bound  over and save my prized possession, “Stop stretching it!”</p>
  <p>“’<em>Kindness from  a certain connection’</em>, meaning…These are all yours?!” Mai  proclaimed at her sudden realization.</p>
  <p>“Shut up!”</p>
  <p>“Why?”</p>
  <p>I immediately knew what  she was implying, “I can tell you the reason, but you have to help  me.”</p>
  <p>“I’ll pass on  combat,” she immediately declared.</p>
  <p>“I’m not counting  on that anyway.”</p>
  <p>“Then what do you  want me to do?”</p>
  <p>I pondered momentarily  before a clever grin crossed my face, “Give me your favorite bra.”</p>
  <p>“What?! Why? Don’t  you own enough already?”</p>
  <p>“It’s not for me,  baka, it’s to put out there.”</p>
  <p>“Like there isn’t  plenty—”</p>
  <p>“A new scent might  help draw him out. So are you going to give it to me or not?”</p>
  <p>She squinted her eyes  at me before getting up and going to her closet to retrieve the item  in question. Once she placed it in my hands, I hung it up outside  without delay. As I did so, I informed her of how my little  collection had started out of my stress from school and exams. She  looked at me skeptically the entire time, but I assured her that it  was the only answer I had and would be giving whether she believed me  or not.</p>
  <p>Now seated at the small  floor table, Mai switched spots with me to gaze out at her now  unprotected garment.</p>
  <p>“My special one…”  the girl pouted childishly.</p>
  <p>“You said you’d  help,” I reminded her.</p>
  <p>She hung her head, “It  turned into Orphan bait.”</p>
  <p>“That’s just <em>one</em> piece. My whole collection is out there.”</p>
  <p>“You and your dumb  stress reliever hobby…” Mai muttered under her breath, barely  loud enough to hear as we continued to wait.</p>
  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
  “Ikezu…”
  <p>I couldn’t exactly recall just <em>how</em> I managed to get myself  bound by my arms and legs to the bed, another body straddling my own,  but that was the position I was currently in.</p>
  <p>I gazed up into the sparkling emerald eyes hovering above my own…the  lips that were continuingly being pulled back just out of my reach…I  watched as they curled into a grin.</p>
  <p>“Who are you calling <em>‘meanie’</em>?” my dark-haired captor  playfully questioned, “You said it was my turn tonight.”</p>
  <p>“Mou…but Natsuki is being so cruel…making me wait like this,”  I pouted, straining myself to try to get closer to her.</p>
  <p>She leaned in, oh so much closer, only to slip her finger between my  waiting lips and hers, mocking me yet again, “Un-uh. Patience.”</p>
  <p>I grumbled in protest again much like a small child awaiting their  presents on Christmas morning as she pulled back from me once again,  but rather than lean back, she inched down, taking the red tie of my  school uniform between her teeth. She pulled lightly and the knot  easily came undone. I watched as the girl took the cloth in her hands  and proceeded to cover my eyes with it.</p>
  <p>“A blindfold too?” I inquired as Natsuki gently lifted my head to  tie the thing in place.</p>
  <p>“If that’s how I choose to play, you can’t object…” she  stated, finishing up her work.</p>
  <p>“Who said I was objec—nh.”</p>
  <p>Before I could finish, my lips were captured by Natsuki’s,  silencing me instantaneously. Although I was left breathless, the  kiss ended far too soon.</p>
  <p>I felt the girl’s hands snake their way to right below my chest as  the raven-haired girl began to unbutton my tan jacket. Once she was  done with that, simply leaving it open since she couldn’t exactly  take it off of me, she moved on to my blouse. Before I knew it, my  bra was undone as well, but this, unlike the previous two items, was  quickly removed and discarded. I heard the rustling of more clothing  being removed, and the girl confirmed this when I felt her warm flesh  upon my own.</p>
  <p>Natsuki took my lips with hers again, both parting enough for our  tongues to mesh as I felt her hand wander to my chest and grope my  right breast. I moaned into the kiss as I arched my back, forcing my  breast further into her palm supplying me with gentle ministrations.</p>
  <p>When our lips parted, she took her time tracing my jaw line with her  tongue before eventually reaching my ear. Immediately taking my lobe  into her mouth, she lightly bit the soft skin before allowing her  tongue to have it’s taste as well.</p>
  <p>Planting kisses on my fiery skin as she made her way further south, I  squirmed with anticipation as she licked the chasm between my  breasts.</p>
  <p>“Nh…Natsuki…” I couldn’t help but sigh as my body tensed.</p>
  <p>I felt her hand leave my breast…</p>
  <p>…Her body shift over mine…</p>
  <p>And then my veil was lifted.</p>
  <p>I opened my eyes to realize I was on my side, clinging tightly to my  pillow, and more notably, I was all alone.</p>
  <p>“Gun…fire…?” I groggily stammered before awakening fully to  the situation, “The thief!”</p>
  <p>Quickly rolling out of bed, I threw my pastel violet robe over my  nightgown, and slipping into a pair of slippers, I dashed outside.</p>
  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
  Another hour passed  without the smallest disturbance outside. By now, Mikoto was sound  asleep on the couch, clinging tightly to her sword case. Mai, who was  seated at the desk beside me, had laid her head down about fifteen  minutes ago when my shift had started. Taking a moment to glance  over, I saw that the girl had dozed off as well.
  <p>“Honestly…” I  whispered, leaving my post to go fetch a blanket from her closet.</p>
  <p>When I returned with  the item, I carefully placed it over her, causing her to stir  slightly. A flash of that first night I spent with Shizuru crossed my  mind, causing me to gasp slightly at the sudden visual memory.</p>
  <p>All reminiscing was cut  short, however, when I looked up to see a small green creature in the  window, his claws wrapped around one of the bras hanging over him.</p>
  <p>He was tiny, ugly, had  a few pieces of lingerie about his small frame…and was in the  middle of stealing one of my precious garments.</p>
  <p>Releasing a  bloodcurdling scream, I fired as many rounds as my poor revolvers  could possibly manage. Once my trigger finger calmed down and the  lights flickered on, I stared straight ahead at the demolished window  while breathing rather heavily from the shock of it all.</p>
  <p>“What-what was that?”  Mai asked, totally shaken from the rude awakening. It took her a few  seconds to take the current situation in, “EH?! Wait, all the  lingerie is gone!”</p>
  <p>“I won’t…let it  escape!” I bolted out. “Duran!”</p>
  <p>A beam of light  radiated from the room before giant shards of ice broke through the  window. As soon as it shattered, taking some of the building with it,  Duran few out with me on his back.</p>
  <p>“BAKA!” I heard Mai  yell after me, but I was too engrossed with my current objective to  even care.</p>
  <p>In pursuit, I let Duran  have full control over tracking the little bastard down. It didn’t  take him too long to catch onto his scent, and I soon spotted the  Orphan running across the football field as we flew overhead. Without  any command, Duran immediately dropped down in front of the thing,  the speed of our decent causing him to slide forward a bit as he shot  his legs out to land.</p>
  <p>“This is as far as  you go,” I dangerously warned the creature while taking aim.</p>
  <p>The Orphan sent me a  toothy grin, and in the blink of an eye, the entire field was filled  with hundreds upon hundreds of similar green monsters. I jerked back  at the sight, and gasped as I looked around to see the whole of them  surround my Child and me.</p>
  <p>“No way!” I  shrieked before attempting to compose myself again, “No matter how  many of you there are…”</p>
  <p>And then they lunged.  They <em>all</em> lunged.</p>
  <p>Before I could even  react, Duran bucked, sending me flying as the Orphans piled on top of  him. I landed hard on my shoulder, sliding several feet after I hit  the ground.</p>
  <p>Grimacing, I sat up,  and when I opened my eyes, my Child was nowhere to be seen. “Duran!”  I cried out in concern, but my attention was quickly averted when it  became aware to me that the creatures had formed into one giant  Orphan.</p>
  <p><em>So this is the real  form.</em></p>
  <p>Still nursing my sore  shoulder as my eyes passed over the large monster, I suddenly caught  movement coming from one of its feet, and I was horrified to see  Duran struggling to free himself.</p>
  <p><em>Duran.</em></p>
  <p>The next thing I knew,  several pink tentacles were flying in my direction. I turned to  shoot, but I wasn’t fast enough as they wrapped around my body and  hoisted me up off the ground. I tried to fight back, but the thing  was just too strong as it continued to try to crush me. Darkness was  beginning to take me when the Orphan violently jerked.</p>
  <p>“Mikoto, do it now!”  I heard a familiar voice command, followed by an animalistic growl,  the sound of metal against flesh, and then a horrible pained cry.</p>
  <p>The rustling of the  wind and my own weightlessness woke me from my near unconsciousness.  Luckily for me, Duran had also been freed and came to my rescue  before I could crash into the ground.</p>
  <p>“This is as much as  we’ll help,” I heard Mai call out to me as I landed.</p>
  <p>“You guys…” I  whispered to myself before getting back to the matter at hand.</p>
  <p>“Duran! Load Silver  Cartridge…Fire!”</p>
  <p>The two missiles flew  through the air, erupting into a barrage of ice shards before lodging  into the monstrous Orphan. The thing immediately swelled, looking  something like a blowfish, before exploding mere seconds later.</p>
  <p>I looked up to the sky  as I watched it disappear, allowing myself a relieved sigh.</p>
  <p><em>Thank god that’s  over…and we don’t have to worry about having anything stolen  again either. Hey, speaking of, whatever happened to…No…nononono…</em></p>
  <p>My contented visage  shattered revealing one of pure dismay as I snapped my head skyward  again. I watched in horror as little pieces of fabric flittered  through the air like snow back down to the earth. I held out my hand  and caught one of the flakes only to confirm what I was seeing.</p>
  <p>“My collection…” I barely managed.</p>
  <p>It wasn’t long before my hands clinched into fist and my teeth  gritted together. I could feel myself steaming as I roared.</p>
  <p>“STUPID BASTARD!”</p>
