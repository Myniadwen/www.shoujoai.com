<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jee-zus,”  Tate muttered as he looked at the menu posted outside of <em>Ichi’s  Beachside Restaurant and Inn, </em>which proudly boasted the <em>cheapest,  tastiest sukiyaki in Goza! </em>As it happened, the <em>cheapest,  tastiest sukiyaki in Goza! </em>would cost him no less than seventeen  hundred and fifty yen.  “<em>This </em>is cheap?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s  wrong, Big Brother?” Shiho asked from Tate’s arm, innocently  ignorant of the toll that her demand of “I want sukiyaki!” would  exact on her “Big Brother”; on his bank balance, and quite  possibly on his sanity.  Tate Yuuichi was from Tokyo, after all,  where if you didn’t like the cost of the <em>cheapest sukiyaki in </em>the city, you went around the corner to a McDonalds and got an  American-style hamburger.  “I’m hungry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know you are, Shiho,” Tate frowned. “But this is really  expensive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  sign says it’s cheap.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  sign is lying. Look here,” he pointed to the “beef sukiyaki”  entry on the menu.  “That’s plenty cheap if you own Mie  prefecture, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiho  frowned.  “It’s too much for you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tate  looked away, a little embarrassed.  “I don’t think I have that  kind of money to throw around, Shiho.  I’m really sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  supposed that his surprise at her reaction was a sign of their  slowly-but-surely degenerating relationship.  She smiled and nodded.  “That’s alright.  I don’t mind not eating here if it’s too  expensive.  Do you think we could go get something from the grocery  store, though? I’m very hungry.”  Her ultra-polite tone surprised  him as much as anything, and he felt something sink in his stomach at  her formality.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>In  spite of everything, </em>he supposed, <em>I still love this girl like  my sister. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  problem,” he forced a grin, and suddenly found it hard to relax  around a girl he’d been friends with for more than half a decade.  Hard to be himself<br />
      <em>around  the girl that killed you</em><br />
  around  somebody who he’d very nearly fallen in love with once.  He  supposed that last one was the most normal of them all; he was  privately amazed that the two of them were able to interact at all  after that…what had they called it? That <em>carnival. </em>He  supposed the only reason that they could was a dedicated effort on  the part of Shiho, and something not quite like habit, but not  entirely like affection, either, that came from him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or maybe  it was the way she still beamed when she grasped onto his arm and  found he could only muster a half-grin.  Maybe that was it, he  thought as he made his way into the grocery store that was curiously  next door to the <em>cheapest sukiyaki in Goza.</em></span></p>

Mai  found that walking around with Mikoto was like drinking hot tea when  you were sick: It probably didn’t actually make your cold go away,  but you felt a hell of a lot better anyway; you felt your throat  clear and your muscles relax, and maybe you even drifted off into a  welcome, blissful sleep.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  didn’t actually talk a lot; Mikoto wasn’t exactly a dazzling  conversationalist, and while Mai had the ability to make nice with  just about anybody, almost on command,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>good  girl has to smile pretty for the camera</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">she  found that she had little to say to the perpetually happy girl next  to her, but it was a “little to say” that existed because there  was no need for it, not because there was no interest in it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or maybe  it was <em>because </em>this girl was perpetually happy that she had no  need to converse with her all the time.  Maybe she didn’t have to  work to make Mikoto happy, and maybe that was one of the reasons she  felt so strongly attached to her.  She had thought at first that this  was incredibly selfish, until she had spoken with Chie about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Most  relationships between people are selfish; if they weren’t, their  give and take wouldn’t be so important, </em>she had said. <em>When  people find somebody that makes them happy, they want to have those  people near them so that they can be happy.  It sounds awful, but  it’s not; it’s actually one of the sweetest things I’ve ever  seen, because in the midst of all that selfishness, you see these  people doing wonderful things for each other; and their only reward,  the only thing they really want out of it, is for that person to keep  being alive and happy.  Their supposed selfishness actually results  in what’s probably the purest form of altruism in the world, and  that’s what I see between you and Mikoto. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  was also a closet cynic, but Mai had found something true in those  words, and it had eased her mind at once when she heard them. <em>When  somebody makes you happy and you make them happy and you don’t hurt  each other, you’ve got something. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mai?”  Mikoto was tugging at her arm, and Mai emerged from her head quickly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  is the grocery store right next to the restaurant?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  thought it was a silly question, at first; something that a  three-year old might ask, something that could only be answered with  something like, <em>because it is, </em>until she noticed the man in  the white cook’s apron sneaking into a side entrance on the  restaurant with grocery bags full of what looked like shirataki  noodles.  She grinned to herself privately, and looked down at  Mikoto, who always had been and always would be sharper than she let  on.  “I believe that would be called ‘emergency restock,’  Mikoto.”  She grinned a little, noticing that while the restaurant  advertised the <em>cheapest sukiyaki in Goza, </em>its prices were in  fact relatively exorbitant.  She wondered briefly how the customers  would feel to know that they were being extorted for what was  essentially boxed shirataki noodles on a fancy plate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Provided  that the plate even </em>is <em>fancy, </em>she mused. <em>For all I  know, they cover the plates in sawdust before they serve it for that  great mesquite taste that you just can’t get enough of. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  said this last part in English in her head, remembering an  advertisement she’d seen once, and laughed at several years later  when somebody told her that it essentially meant that the commercial  wanted people to pay to make their food taste like burning wood.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  shall we go in, or are we going to wait for the food to come to us  out here?” Mai grinned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  could ambush the emergency restock,” Mikoto smiled back as the  short, old man dashed into the grocery store a second time.  “Then  we wouldn’t even have to pay for the food.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  chuckled.  “And just how would we do that, exactly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mikoto  stared at Mai’s weapon—her pair of weapons, rather—making it  very clear just how they would do that, exactly.  Mai blushed  abruptly and shook her head.  “Get out of here, you little—”  she started, and then noticed just how intently the younger girl was  staring at her pair of weapons.  She took off like a shot into the  grocery store as Mikoto began giggling, and the little shit tore  after her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  tore straight into the store, unthinking of what the owners would  think—probably they were their only business right now, aside from  the restaurant, anyway, so Mikoto didn’t think it mattered; but as  her consciousness became enraptured in the thrill of the chase, her  nostrils flaring with the scent of her pray, her ears gradually  tuning in only to the sound of Mai’s footsteps, she cared less and  less.  Her stomach growled, and a predatory grin enveloped her face,  until finally, they reached a corner; Mai turned, slowing as she did,  around a neat little noodle display, and Mikoto pounced—</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Shiho  picked up a ripe-looking imported persimmon, sniffed the bottom,  found it to be as fragrant as she could hope for in the off-season.  She showed it to Tate, who smiled, nodded, and then said, “Go pick  out something with meat or noodles in it, Shiho; I don’t want you  starving to death.” <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Okay, </span></em>mom.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiho  nodded, and the two of them started walking towards the first aisle,  where they had seen what appeared to be a microwave noodle display.  (Shiho had seen the persimmons and gotten distracted).</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the  last moment of the display’s existence, Tate thought, <em>Wow.  That’s really quite a neat display considering it’s just packages  of microwave noodles. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  the last moments of the display’s existence, Shiho, ever-observant,  thought, <em>what is that, exactly? It’s moving really fast.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  took four seconds for the noodle display to die:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">1: We  can observe Mai rounding the corner, seeing Tate with some vague  immediate sense of recognition mostly blurred out by the adrenaline  pumping in her brain. Similarly, we can observe Mikoto, noticing the  noodle display, mostly by way of her stomach.  Shiho is just now  having her thought concerning the incredible speed of the two  projectiles hurtling themselves at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">2:  Mikoto’s feet seem to lift themselves from the ground as she  pounces.  Mai notices the collision imminent on her present course,  looks back, and notices the other collision imminent.  In some  far-off corner of her brain, she thinks, <em>hey, at least that  display will block her. </em>Shiho’s eyes widen in alarm, and Tate  reciprocates Mai’s recognition, notices the black monster rising  steadily towards the noodle display, eyes wide and blazing, mouth  open and predatory.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">3:  Shiho, unable to dive out of the way in time, drops to the ground,  covering her head in panic, and Mai, similarly unable to stop herself  in time, trips over her.  Tate’s eyes widen in alarm as he sees the <em>third </em>imminent collision coming, realizes that there are about  fifty imported persimmons blocking his escape route.  If he knocked  those expensive bastards over, he understands, his fate would be  worse than the death rapidly approaching him.  Meanwhile, Mikoto’s  realizes, all too late, that her calculated path was just barely too  low to carry her <em>over </em>the display, though it will certainly  allow her to capture her prey.  This, in her mind, is justification  enough for the civilian casualties she is sure to cause.  Some  losses, after all, are unavoidable in the pursuit of justice and  food.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">4: The  twisted play that has set itself up so well comes crashing down  around them; Mai lands straight on Tate, who bravely dives on the  proverbial grenade, allowing himself to be carried down with a <em>crash </em>to save the expensive imported persimmons.  Shiho, still  crouching and covering her head, now requiring only a desk to do this  under to be safe during a nuclear attack, serves as kind of a  springboard as Mikoto crashes straight through the display, which  collapses to the ground like a sandcastle annihilated by a drunken  bully on his way to throw up in a small child’s hair. The ravenous  girl lands on top of Shiho’s head, painfully (for her), and bounces  off of it, prepared for the <em>coup de grace, </em>which she ably  delivers, diving straight onto Mai’s back to be carried to the  ground with the rest of them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At  least the persimmons were saved, but at cost of the brave Private  Tate Yuuichi.  War ain’t fair.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
‘Sir’  was gone but his backpack was still at the counter.  Shizuru was also  gone. As Natsuki realized this, her paranoia began to spark off  alerts in her brain.  Before she acted rashly, however, she asked the  old lady at the counter where he had gone.  She said he had left  shortly after “your lovely friend,” stating that he’d left  something in his car, but that he would be back. He had even left his  heavy old backpack.  Which, the lady added in a <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">just-between-us-girls </span></em>tone that Natsuki had never been able to relate to, even when the  person speaking WAS <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">us girls, </span></em>she had secretly peeked into the  pack, just a little, and seen a bunch of metal tools, tools whose  purpose and usage she didn’t have the slightest inkling of.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All  those little paranoid buzzings in Natsuki’s brain turned into  full-blown alarms as she verily tore out the door, tossing her  near-purchase on the counter; about a billion of those little alarms,  and not just the standard <em>stalker alert prepare nut-kick </em>alarms,  either. Shizuru didn’t know it, but she had a lot of enemies; she  had destroyed the entire First District headquarters, in less than a  day, almost as a side-note. Even if the destruction <em>had </em>been  complete, which wasn’t guaranteed in any way, First District had a  lot of people who didn’t work in the building, and a lot of people  who believed pretty devoutly in their work.  Any one of them could  be—</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>that  thing you forgot<br />
  you  forgot your gun</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">—chatting  pleasantly with Shizuru, who was leaning against the wall to the  building as calmly as she did anything.  Natsuki burst out the door,  but before she could shout so much as a warning, the man she was  chatting with, a moderately handsome fortysomething dressed in rather  dorky-looking woodland camouflage, grinned at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is  this the friend you were talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  nodded.  “Natsuki Kuga, meet Minoru Alder,” she said, indicating  each as she introduced them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nice  to meet you,” Minorou said, bowing a little informally.  Natsuki  bowed back awkwardly.  “Your friend here was just telling me that  you’re staying over at the beachside resort.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  nodded, a little shaken, a little confused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  great! My wife and I are staying there too; I’d ask you to come  visit us tonight, but she’s having her mother over for dinner  tonight, and to be honest, the woman is a grumpy old coot.”  She  couldn’t put her finger on it yet, but something about this set off  her paranoia alarms again. He fiddled with his wedding band absently,  and then put his hand to his forehead in sudden realization.  “Oh,  crap.  I left my backpack in there, and I have to get back before my  wife kills me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  smiled gracefully.  “It was good to meet you, Mr. Alder.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minoru  is fine,” the man grinned back.  “Say, if you’d like, she’d  love to have the two of you over for dinner tomorrow night, along  with as many of your friends as will come.  We have plenty of food,  and I think both me and my wife would vastly prefer your company to  her mother’s.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you very much for your invitation, Minoru,” Shizuru said politely.  “Perhaps we will; would it be all right if Natsuki,” she glanced  at the younger girl, who was still staring, all the adrenaline that  had rushed into her head slowly draining, and continued, “May we  come by tomorrow to tell you if we will be coming or not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,”  Minoru grinned, and then went into the store with a, “Gotta go!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The door  closed, and Natsuki remembered the panties she had so carelessly  thrown on the counter, fled<br />
      <em>away  from Shizuru</em><br />
  into  the store wordlessly. She saw Minoru putting his purchase—a pair of  simple white granny-panties—into his backpack; he gave her a grin  and a wave, and then hoisted his backpack with a grunt and a <em>clank</em> over his shoulder and left.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She saw  what she was looking for laying on the counter where she’d thrown  it.  The store owner gave her a disapproving look, and she had the  good grace to look sheepish about it.  She bought the panties and  left.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When she  got outside, new <em>(hem-hem) </em>purchase clutched tight in a ball  inside her hands, intent on</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>show  her<br />
  tell  her</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>…</em>something  she wasn’t certain of yet, only that she was very intent on it  indeed, however, her breath caught in her chest.  It took her a  moment of immediate searching to confirm it entirely, but after  scouring all of the places a human could conceivably reach without  running</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>or  being carried</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">in the  course of about half a minute, she knew it for certain, and it  stopped her heart for a good ten seconds when it hit her fully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  was gone.</span></p>
