<a href="../maihime/crosspath-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Chie Harada entered the student council room shortly
before the meeting started, settling down with a
confident smile. Her dark hair fell down over her
glasses as she laid out the papers, then looked around
the room as she waited for everyone to arrive.

Reito Kansaki, student council president, sat at the
head of the table, the black haired man&#39;s expression
calm and mild. Beside him vice president Alyssa Searss
studied some documents, the blonde girl&#39;s expression
cool but intense. Next came the head of the executive
committee Yukino Kikukawa, the reddish brown haired
woman who was now Chie&#39;s boss. And finally Erstin Ho,
the busty blonde who had taken up the task of being
the council&#39;s secretary and Occasionally general
assistant.

&quot;Welcome, everyone,&quot; Reito addressed the room with a
cool smile, &quot;I believe we&#39;ll start off with the
executive committee&#39;s report.&quot;

Yukino rose from her seat, her glasses gleaming.
&quot;We&#39;ve made some discoveries regarding the harassment
case.&quot; She gestured, &quot;Chie?&quot;

Chie nodded, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to report that the individual
leaving threatening notes with Miss Ho is Takeda
Masashi.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Erstin blinked.

&quot;My old classmate?&quot; Reito also blinked before
frowning. &quot;How did you determine this?&quot; he asked them.

&quot;Members of the executive took turns warching Erstin&#39;s
locker, and we observed Takeda covertly placing a note
there,&quot; Chie explained calmly. &quot;After that we followed
him to confirm that he wasn&#39;t leaving the notes on
someone else&#39;s behalf.&quot;

&quot;Still, are we sure he&#39;s the note writer?&quot; Alyssa
asked.

&quot;Here&#39;s one of the notes left to Erstin,&quot; Chie passed
over two sheets of paper, &quot;the other is a sample of
Takeda&#39;s handwriting we acquired.&quot; She smiled
slightly, &quot;Yukino asked Miyu to compare them, she&#39;s
certain they were written by the same man.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Alyssa gave Yukino a respectful look. Only three
people in this room knew Miyu was a android, but they
all respected the young lady&#39;s skills.

Reito looked pained as he sat back in his chair. &quot;It
makes a certain kind of sense that it was Takeda,&quot; he
conceded.

Erstin looked puzzled, &quot;I don&#39;t understand, what did I
do?&quot;

Yukino reached out and gently squeezed Erstin&#39;s
shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s not your fault,&quot; she said gently,
&quot;though it&#39;s a bit complicated to explain.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m rather curious myself,&quot; Alyssa admitted.

&quot;Takeda had the bad luck to fall in love with Natsuki
Kuga,&quot; Chie took it on herself to explain, &quot;who he
pined over for several months. In the end Natsuki
turned him down because she fell in love with someone
else... Shizuru Fujino.&quot;

Erstin&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;The former president.&quot;

&quot;And a woman,&quot; Alyssa nodded in understanding.

&quot;Apparently Takeda hasn&#39;t gotten over it,&quot; Yukino
looked thoughtful, &quot;and has decided to take his
frustrations out on Erstin.&quot;

Reito nodded grimly. &quot;All right then,&quot; he said to the
room at large, &quot;how do we want to handle this?&quot;

&quot;We could call him before the council and demand a
explaination,&quot; Alyssa offered, &quot;then bring it to the
school...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rather keep this quiet,&quot; Erstin sighed. She
smiled weakly, &quot;The infamy of my coming out is fading,
I don&#39;t want any wore attention.&quot;

Chie winced slightly, reminded of her own role in this
mess.

Reito nodded chivelrously to Erstin, &quot;Yukino, would
your executive committee be able to handle this
quietly?&quot;

Yukino nodded, &quot;Leave it to me.&quot;

Alyssa leaned forward, &quot;Just don&#39;t do anything we&#39;ll
regret later.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Yukino smiled.

The meeting ended not long after, and Yukino and Chie
headed out together. &quot;So,&quot; Chie asked quietly, &quot;what&#39;s
the plan?&quot;

&quot;We get some assistence first,&quot; Yukino said as she
drew out her phone and dialed. She flashed Chie a
smile, &quot;Nice work, by the way.&quot;

Chie grinned, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Looking up she added Yukino
quietly, &quot;Could you excuse me for a moment?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Yukino said as she saw Erstin hesitate
nearby.

Chie walked over to Erstin, feeling more nervous than
she usually did. She was used to chasing stories and
could normally ask the most intrusive things, but
knowing the pain she had unthinkingly unleashed on
Erstin made her weak. &quot;Erstin,&quot; she started quietly.

Erstin looked up, the blonde smiling as she said,
&quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;Considering it&#39;s my fault your in this mess,&quot; Chie
said, &quot;you don&#39;t need to thank me. In fact, I&#39;m just
hoping you can forgive my stupidity eventually...&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Erstin agreed after a moment, &quot;eventually.&quot;

Yukino dialed the number, reaching her target in a
moment. &quot;I hate to impose,&quot; she said after exchanging
greetings, &quot;but I have a kendo related matter I may
need help dealing with.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Takeda knelt in the kendo hall, seeking peace through
meditation as he ballanced his practice sword across
his legs. Peace was elusive, this time, as his recent
actions weighed heavily on the young man&#39;s mind.

&#39;I need to stop this,&#39; Takeda sighed, his black hair a
spiky mess as usual. He thought of Natsuki and winced,
&#39;If I want revenge, I should have the courage to face
her, not take it out on a substitute.&#39;

With a bang the doors to the practice hall were
slammed open, and three figures strode inside. At the
lead was Yukino, her expression hard and cold as iron.
Behind her Tate Yuuichi followed, along with Miyu
Greer.

&quot;What are you...?&quot; Takeda demanded, grabbing his
weapon.

With surprising speed Tate struck, his own wooden
sword swiftly slapping Takeda&#39;s away. &quot;We&#39;d like to
talk to you,&quot; there was sarcasm in his voice as he
added, &quot;sir.&quot;

Yukino pushed up her glasses with a finger as she gave
Takeda a disgusted look. &quot;We know that you&#39;re the
source of the insulting letters to Erstin Ho,&quot; she
said flatly.

&#39;How did...&#39; Takeda thought, then quickly got himself
under control. &quot;I did not!&quot; he said forcefully.

&quot;Voice stress indicates he&#39;s lying,&quot; Miyu reported to
Yukino softly.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Yukino murmured back, glad she had asked
Alyssa if she could borrow Miyu.

&quot;What are you planing to do?&quot; Takeda asked them,
feeling just a bit unnerved by Miyu&#39;s emotionless
gaze.

Yukino met his eyes, &quot;If I could, I&#39;d haul you in
front of the student body and denounce you for the
coward that you are.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t do...&quot; Takeda tried to protest.

&quot;Oh shut up,&quot; Tate snapped at him. &quot;I&#39;ve seen the
notes, it&#39;s your handwriting. And picking on a
kid...!&quot;

Once more Takeda felt a stab of guilt, and had to look
away.

&quot;Here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do,&quot; Yukino faced him down
with eyes that glittered with repressed anger, &quot;you
are going to stop writing notes and stay the hell away
from Erstin, and we won&#39;t turn you in to the school
authorities.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Takeda said quietly.

&quot;And if you don&#39;t,&quot; Tate said to him quietly, &quot;I will
personally take great pleasure in thrashing you before
turning you in.&quot;

Takeda nodded, turning away from all three people&#39;s
gazes.

&quot;Do you think it&#39;ll work?&quot; Tate wondered as they
walked away together.

&quot;My voice stress meters indicate that he&#39;s sincere,&quot;
Miyu said calmly, &quot;however that does not guarenttee he
won&#39;t change his mind.&quot;

&quot;Well, unless Erstin decides to go after him
officially this is the best we can do,&quot; Yukino sighed
softly. She looked at Tate and smiled, &quot;Thank you for
your help, Tate.&quot;

Tate smiled shyly, &quot;No, I was glad to help.&quot;

&quot;And you, Miyu,&quot; Yukino turned to her, &quot;thanks.&quot;

&quot;I merely obeyed Miss Alyssa&#39;s request that I help
you,&quot; Miyu answered calmly. A slight smile teased her
lips, &quot;However, I will confess some satisfaction in
making him squirm in there.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Tate agreed. He checked his watch and
sighed, &quot;I&#39;d better get going... but call if you need
any more help.&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; Yukino agreed.
