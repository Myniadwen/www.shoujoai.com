<p>The Reality  of Things</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>Distance.</em>
<p>That’s exactly what  came between Natsuki and myself after that Halloween night.</p>
<p>She stopped coming  over. She stopped meeting with me at the garden for lunch. The only  time I heard her voice was the few times I had the courage to try and  call her, however, that only resulted in one-word answers, her  dodging my questions, and her inevitably ending the call before I  could really even say anything.</p>
<p>Busy, she said. She was<em>busy</em> with <em>things</em>.</p>
<p><em>This is my fault…I  went too far…</em></p>
<p>I had known Natsuki was  uncomfortable with me being that way with her, she was so body shy,  but I never thought I’d scare her off like that...I hadn’t meant  for it to be anything more than my usual friendly teasing…</p>
<p><em>Just keep telling  yourself that…</em></p>
<p>I owed her an  explanation. More like an apology. The only problem was she wasn’t  giving me that chance. It wasn’t something I could do over the  phone. I had to, <em>needed</em> <em>to</em>, tell her in person.</p>
<p><em>You’re not truly  sorry…</em></p>
<p>And then there was that  scar on her wrist. I had never noticed it before. Granted she usually  wore long sleeves, but still…Where had it come from? I wanted to  ask her about it, but considering how things were at the moment, I  doubted that it would be a very good idea to go prodding.</p>
<p>Four weeks. That’s  how long she managed to avoid me. I have to give her credit for that.  She was still coming to school, but she somehow always slipped away  before I could catch her. By this time, my guilt was beginning to  build up along with my yearning to talk to her again…see her again.  I missed her. Simply missed her.</p>
<p><em>Missed? More like…</em></p>
<p>I tried my best to keep  busy with things, and that helped, if only a little. Then one day  towards the end of November she suddenly called. I couldn’t believe  it when her name popped up on my caller I.D. and, needless to say, I  flipped open my cell with all haste and shoved the thing to my ear.</p>
<p>“Natsuki?”</p>
<p>“<em>Hey.”</em></p>
<p>She sounded like she  always did, like we had talked just yesterday. I was beyond relieved.</p>
<p>“Hey…how have you  been?”</p>
<p>“<em>Alright. You  busy?”</em></p>
<p>“No, why do you ask?”</p>
<p>Even if I had been a  doctor in the middle of brain surgery I would have said the same.</p>
<p>“<em>Just meet me at  the parking lot behind the school. I have something to show you.”</em></p>
<p>There was a rather  excited tone to her voice.</p>
<p>“O-Okay…”</p>
<p>“<em>See you in a  few.” </em></p>
<p>The dead phone line  buzzed in my ear.</p>
<p><em>Natsuki…initiating  a meeting…?</em></p>
<p>I had to have been  dreaming. I just knew it. I pulled my phone away and just stared at  the screen until it faded to black.</p>
<p>“Huh.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t about to sit  here and analyze the situation. Natsuki had called <em>me</em>. Not the  other way around like usual. Something was up…Something <em>had</em> to be up. I certainly wasn’t complaining though. I was finally  going to get my chance to talk to her.</p>
<p><em>See her…</em></p>
<p>I quickly threw on a  jacket and slipped into my shoes before walking down the street to  the Academy. When I got there and turned the corner towards the back  parking lot, my eyes immediately locked onto the lone raven-haired  figure clad in a dark grey and red leather body suit leaning against  a midnight blue motorcycle.</p>
<p>When she realized I was  approaching, she turned around and waved at me, “Yo.”</p>
<p>I remained speechless  as I stopped before the vehicle, but it wasn’t what my attention  was on.</p>
<p><em>That suit…it’s  rather revealing—!</em></p>
<p>“Beautiful, isn’t  it?”</p>
<p>“H-Huh?” I  responded, snapping out of my daze. I could feel myself blushing  slightly, but luckily Natsuki was too preoccupied to notice.</p>
<p><em>Why am I…?</em></p>
<p>“The bike…do you  like it? I wanted to show you as soon as I got it,” she informed  me, beaming with pride as she slapped the seat with her gloved hand.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s…nice.  What made you want to get a bike?”</p>
<p>…<em>Natsuki…</em></p>
<p>She looked at me like I  was crazy, “Who <em>wouldn’t</em> want one? This baby’s amazing.  She’s an import, but she’s still fast. Haven’t you ever ridden  one before?”</p>
<p>I shook my head,  dumbfounded.</p>
<p>She just rolled her  eyes at me before grabbing the helmet that had been resting on the  back of the bike this whole time, “Then let’s go.”</p>
<p>“You mean?!”</p>
<p><em>Just forget about it  for now.</em></p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah…” she  retorted as she slipped the thing on before opening the back  compartment on the bike and pulling out another helmet, shoving it in  my direction, “Here.”</p>
<p>I put the thing on as  fast as I could, overly excited about actually getting to go on my  first motorcycle ride, and with Natsuki on top of that. After we were  situated on the vehicle, however, that previous excitement quickly  turned into anxiety at the roar of the engine. I heard Natuski let  out a triumphant <em>‘ha’</em> at the sound.</p>
<p>The bike shook in its  idle state causing me to squeak as I wrapped my arms tightly around  her waist. At the touch, she turned her head to look at me over her  shoulder.</p>
<p>“We haven’t even  moved yet,” her muffled voice proclaimed.</p>
<p><em>How would I know? I  have my eyes shut.</em></p>
<p>“You don’t have to  do this if you don’t want to—”</p>
<p>“No! I do!” I  nervously protested a little too loudly.</p>
<p>“Alright…”  Natsuki didn’t sound too convinced, but she urged the bike forward  anyway, making sure to go slowly for my sake.</p>
<p>Eventually I opened my  eyes and lift my head to take in my surroundings.</p>
<p>We were traveling down  the main road heading back towards the city. My grip around Natsuki  loosened slightly, and sensing the movement, she spoke.</p>
<p>“Better now? See,  it’s not so bad once you get used to it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I responded  more like my usual self.</p>
<p>It really was rather  fun, and I began to relax more and more as we keep going. Even so, I  made sure to keep myself close to her body, taking comfort from her  warmth.</p>
<p><em>I just wish I could  reassure </em><em><strong>you</strong></em><em> that being close to someone else  isn’t so bad either…</em></p>
<p>As much as I was  enjoying our little ride around town, I still knew in my heart that I  needed to talk to her, and that wasn’t going to be so easy while  still on the motorcycle, so when we stopped at a red light, I  proposed my idea.</p>
<p>“Hey, Natsuki, can we  stop somewhere?”</p>
<p>“Sure. Where to?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t really  matter…I just…we need to talk...”</p>
<p>“Huh? Alright…I  guess we’ll just head back to your place then.”</p>
<p>In a few minutes, we  were back at the dorms. Natsuki parked the bike and after we had  taken off our helmets, we headed on up to my room.</p>
<p>Once we were inside,  Natsuki jumped onto my bed, “So what’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“It’s about what  happened that night we went to the movies…” I started as I placed  my jacket on its hangar and set it back in its spot in my closet.</p>
<p>“What about it?”</p>
<p>“What I did…” I  paused momentarily before finally just spitting it out, “Look, if I  made you uncomfortable by…touching you…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p><em>Touching? I’m not  sure if what you did can be that easily defined…especially since  you enjoyed—</em></p>
<p>A half amused look took  over her features, “Is that what this is all about? I thought you  were acting a little weird earlier…Wait…You don’t think I was,  like, avoiding you or something because of that, did you?”</p>
<p>She seemed to spit the  words at me, and I turned away from her.</p>
<p>“Heh, you’re a  weird one, Fujino.” she muttered as she got up and made her way  towards the door, “Well, I’m off to go ride around some more. See  you later.”</p>
<p>I heard the door open  and close, but I still didn’t move.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t very  convincing, you know?” I whispered to the now empty spot where  Natsuki was just sitting.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Four weeks. That’s  how long I managed to steer clear of Shizuru. The last time we had  been together, well, to be perfectly honest, she had freaked me out.  Why had she been all clingy? And then what happened when we were back  at her dorm…the tone in her voice when she came up on me from  behind…I had never heard her sound like that before. I just  couldn’t be around her for a while after that happened.
<p>On top of that, I had  finally started looking into my mother’s case. Between going to  school, exercising in the afternoons, and trying to gain information  in the evenings, I didn’t really have much time for anything else.  I had told myself I was going to do this, and I was absolutely  serious about that proclamation.</p>
<p>To say that I didn’t  miss spending time with Shizuru would have been a lie despite what  had happened the previous month. Sometimes I was tempted to stop by  her dorm, but I refrained from doing so for fear that she would begin  questioning me about what I had been doing all this time. So, I kept  my distance for quite a while, but when I bought the bike, I just <em>had</em> to show someone…and she was the only someone that I had.</p>
<p>When she said that we  needed to talk, I really didn’t know what to expect. Then when she  told me she was sorry about what happened, I couldn’t even think. I  tried to reassure her that it was just a misunderstanding, that I  wasn’t upset, and that nothing had really happened…maybe I was  trying to convince myself of that as well…Either way, I did what I  always do best: I ran away.</p>
<p>We still talked after  that though, and we spent time together here and there. She tried to  act like her normal self, and to the outside world, we would have  appeared to be our normal selves around each other, but deep down we  were both different. She still teased me thoroughly, poking and  hugging me every now and then much to my discontent, but at least it  hadn’t been in the same way as <em>that</em> night…But that still  didn’t mean that I liked it. I just tolerated it.</p>
<p>It was during this time  that I met Yamada, the man who would become my number one informant  for matters dealing with my mother’s death. He was the first one to  mention the First District to me, but not for free of course. Yamada  told me they were powerful enough to even have their people involved  with the government. But I didn’t care. No matter how big or small  my enemy was, I would hunt them down and demand answers.</p>
<p>This was also when the  whole HiME thing came up again. What exactly was this higher-order  matter? My mother had been researching the same thing when she had  been alive, hadn’t she? Highly advanced materializing  equipment…HiME…that’s what this group was apparently looking  for. They wanted the people with this ability. Despite all of this,  it was what Yamada told me next that made me shiver.</p>
<p>These people, this  First District, they were gathering these <em>‘HiME’</em> at none  other than my own school, Fuuka Academy.</p>
<p>It startled me at  first, but I think somewhere deep down I always had a suspicion about  the school that I couldn’t quite put my finger on.</p>
<p>After I left the bar  that night, I decided that I would sneak into the school to see if I  could find anything.</p>
<p>And what happened there…well, it changed everything.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
When I initially got to  the school that night, after changing back into my uniform, I  surprisingly ran into one of my fellow students. Her name was  Higurashi Akane, she was in the class next to mine, but beyond that,  I didn’t know much else. Apparently she had left her notes inside,  and to best avoid this obstacle, I offered to retrieve them for her  since <em>“I myself had left something inside.”</em>
<p>With Akane gone, I  proceeded onward. I really had no idea where to begin in my personal  investigation, so instead I decided to go find Higurashi’s notes  first when a piercing howl cut through the night’s silence. There  had been rumors of stray dogs wandering the campus as of late, but  the sound I had just heard didn’t belong to any dog I could think  of.</p>
<p>That’s when the mark  started to burn. The mark on the lower left side of my back had been  there for several months now, but it had never stung like this  before.</p>
<p><em>What is this…?</em></p>
<p>Suddenly a voice  reached my ears, “Hi! Pleased to meet you, Natsuki-chan.”</p>
<p>That was the first time  I ever encountered Homura Nagi. Such a creepy little kid…You could  tell that something was suspiciously afoot with him by just looking  at him, but his speech also gave me reason to be wary.</p>
<p>He was the one, on this  chilly night, to inform me that I was a HiME. He knew about the star  too. The marking on my side flared more intensely as I listened to  his words, trying to grasp what was going on before my thoughts were  shook by another mighty howl. Then, suddenly, a beast of the darkest  black appeared before me. It was like a shadow, but it had red eyes  that stared back into my clear emerald ones so intensely that it  terrified me.</p>
<p>What happened next was  quite a blur. I was attacked by the shadow beast, and even though I  ran as fast as I could, I couldn’t escape. I tripped. Screaming up  at the monster looming over me, my mark shined so brightly I could  see it through my clothing, and a strange tingling sensation erupted  in my palms.</p>
<p>The next thing I knew  there were two tiny pistols in my hands. They were oddly shaped  however, not like a normal gun. I didn’t even notice when I pulled  the trigger, at least not until the sound of its fire burst into my  ears.</p>
<p>“That…is your  Element.”</p>
<p>The voice came from the  darkness of the trees around me, but before I could even ask whom it  was, the beast before me moved. I instinctively raised the weapons in  my hands.</p>
<p>“Your Element…the  ritual weapon given to a HiME, the arms you materialized with your  own will…but there is no time to waste. Use them to defeat this  beast.”</p>
<p>“Ele…ment?” I  began to question, but right then, the beast lunged for me.</p>
<p>We struggled, it  snapping and clawing at me, me shooting and dodging.</p>
<p><em>Since when could I  move like this?! I know I’ve been working out more lately, but  still…</em></p>
<p>“This is a HiME. Does  it make you afraid? But, this is a HiME’s fate…however blessed a  fate it might seem, you should have understood that you can’t  escape that system…And yet…” the voice continued to speak, but  was interrupted. Words were exchanged between two individuals  sheltered by the darkness, but I was too preoccupied to listen.</p>
<p>I was beat to all hell.  The beast still continued to growl at me, but for some reason I  wasn’t afraid of it anymore.</p>
<p>I stared directly into  those ruby eyes, “…What am I to you? What is it you want from  me?”</p>
<p>A flash. Memories of  when my father first brought Duran home flooded my mind.</p>
<p><em>These eyes…they’re  just like Duran’s…</em></p>
<p>I lowered my element,  “Do you…feel lonely, too?”</p>
<p>I took a tentative step  forward, the creature before me only watching, but before I knew it,  I was close enough to touch the thing.</p>
<p>“I see…you’ve  been waiting for me…Duran…”</p>
<p>I smiled, and the beast  released another deafening roar.</p>
<p>“You did it,  Natsuki-chan. This child has accepted you. So how about you truly  accept this child, too?” Nagi’s voice piped in, “No matter what  your goal is, this child will become a strong ally. In return,  however, you must wager the thing that’s most important to you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care. I  don’t have anything that’s important to me.”</p>
<p>Suddenly a symbol  appeared beneath the beast and me. A column of water erupted around  us along with a pain in my abdomen, but it was followed by a stab of  pure rapture along my spine.</p>
<p>I embraced the  wolf-like creature before me; it’s former shadowiness fading into  glimmering silver.</p>
<p>“Duran…”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Three days later I finally returned to school. I had been in a  dreamlike state then, trying to figure out everything that had  happened before.
<p><em>Was it real?</em></p>
<p>Yes, the weapons that continued to appear in my hands with a little  concentration were proof of that.</p>
<p><em>Why me? Who was this boy, Nagi? Why is the First District  gathering Himes? Who else had these powers? Why had mom run away from  thee people…why did she have to die? </em></p>
<p>The answers were at Fuuka Academy, and that was the reason why I  returned. There was a certain Afro-senpai that I needed to talk to…</p>
<p>That man, Mr. Sakomizu, I’m not sure when I finally remembered, but  he had been at the place where my mother worked. He had even played  with Duran and me on occasions. So what was he doing here at this  school?</p>
<p>He obviously knew something, I mean, he <em>congratulated</em> me on my  “awakening” when I began to interrogate him during the lunch  break. I tried to question him about the First District and about my  mother, but he dodged my inquiries and told me to back off of the  investigation. Apparently the First District, which he was obviously  a part of, would kill him if he leaked any information at all.</p>
<p>I let him be for the moment, but I had no intention of simply letting  him off the hook.</p>
<p><em>I’ll make you talk one of these days…</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I waited for Natsuki at  our usual spot after school. I hadn’t seen or talked to her in  three days, and she hadn’t been at school during this time either.  I was terribly worried, but I felt like if I tried to call her that  I’d only be pushing her further away in the long run, but when I  had spotted her walking back to class after the lunch break had  ended, I couldn’t refrain myself any longer. Once I got back to  class I decided to send her a text.
<p align="center"><strong>-u  could have told me u were back-</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>-sry-</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>-r u  ok?-</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>-yea-</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>-meet at the usual place after school. k?-</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>-k-</strong></p>
<p>I sat there for a few  minutes before she finally appeared, and when she did, I couldn’t  believe my eyes.</p>
<p>I quickly closed the  distance between us, “Natsuki, what happened? I thought you said  you were fine…you’re covered in scrapes and bruises…”</p>
<p>I had to hold myself  back from cupping her battered cheek in my hand.</p>
<p><em>Natsuki…</em></p>
<p>“It’s nothing  really, just a little accident.”</p>
<p>“Accident? Did you  fall off your bike? I swear I’ll keep you away from that thing if  that’s the case—”</p>
<p>“No, it wasn’t  that. I’m a better driver than that, sheesh...Look, don’t worry  about it, Shizuru.  They’ll heal in a couple of days. They’re so  small they won’t leave any scars.”</p>
<p>“Like that one on  your wrist?”</p>
<p>The words were out of  my mouth before I could even stop myself. The look on Natsuki’s  face was one of complete shock before it returned to its usual cool  composure as she slipped said wrist out of my view.</p>
<p>“When did you see  that?”</p>
<p>“Halloween.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>There was a long  silence between the two of us before I pressed further.</p>
<p>“So are you going to  tell me how you got it?”</p>
<p>“It’s a long  story.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got time.”</p>
<p>Natsuki finally met my  gaze for the first time in our conversation, those beautiful green  eyes pleading with me to stop.</p>
<p>I stared into them for  quite a time before releasing a defeated sigh, “Fine, I won’t  tread where you don’t want me to…but I do wish that you would  trust me enough to talk to me more.”</p>
<p>My words seemed to  sadden her as she averted her eyes elsewhere, “It’s not  that…Maybe one day, Shizuru. I’m just not ready yet.”</p>
<p>Her eyes met mine  again, “If I were going to tell someone, it would be you, Shizuru.  I promise you that much.”</p>
<p>I smiled as best as I  could. Her words truly were sweet, but that didn’t ease the worry  in my mind. I would just have to wait until the time was right for  her.</p>
<p><em>I’d wait forever  for you, Natsuki…</em></p>
<p>“So I guess that  means you won’t tell me why you’ve skipped school the past three  days either, hmm?” I questioned in my usual teasing tone.</p>
<p>She smirked and let out  a small laugh as she shook her head.</p>
<p>There was a small pause  before she spoke again, “Hey, Shizuru?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“You’re a class  representative, right?”</p>
<p>I replied with a nod,  “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“I hear that class  reps have a higher access level within the school’s intranet than  normal students…”</p>
<p>I eyed her curiously,  “Is Natsuki asking me to change her attendance record? Not that I  could anyway…”</p>
<p>“Of course not,”  she defensively retorted, “There was just some information about  the school I was hoping to find.”</p>
<p>“Such as?”</p>
<p>“…The state of its  administration, the director’s name and personal record…And a  register of the staff members and pupils. If possible, their personal  records too.”</p>
<p>“Ara, I’m afraid  that the access level of a class representative is not much above  that of a regular student.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Well, never  mind then, just forget about it.”</p>
<p>It was obvious that she  was disappointed. Why did this mean so much to her? What was she  keeping from me? I knew I wasn’t going to be able to get those  answers right now, or maybe ever. All I could do was help Natsuki in  any way possible. Even if she couldn’t tell me her intentions, I  could still aid her, right?</p>
<p>I came to my decision  with little to no hesitation. I might not know what goal it was  Natsuki was trying to complete, but I would do anything in my power  to help her achieve it. If she needed to get those records, then I  would get them for her. And there was only one way I could think of  to do that…only one inconspicuous means of acquiring that  information…</p>
<p>I would become the next Student Council President of Fuuka Academy.</p>
