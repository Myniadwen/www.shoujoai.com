<h1>A Mai HiME Fiction: Loose Threads (part 7 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a>

<a href="../maihime/loosethreads-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&quot;Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.&quot;

Somehow, Yuuki Nao couldn&#39;t believe that. Even here in this sacred place 
the words of &quot;Our Savior&quot; rang hollow. For the meekest among us remained 
downtrodden under the heels of others.

Nao enjoyed cleaning this small, country church. It wasn&#39;t much but it 
was something. Maybe someday, through her deeds she might gain 
absolution for her sins. Her many, many sins. 

Sins of morality, sins of carnality. She&#39;d hunted and captured and 
robbed and assaulted. But they were all tainted with the stain of sin. 
She only brought them a step toward redemption by relieving them of 
their worldly goods. Yet even with all her work, she could only point 
them towards redemption. She could not save them. Yuuki Nao was 
powerless.

&quot;The meek shall inherit the earth, huh?&quot; The redhead scoffed as she 
polished the statue of the Holy Mother. 

&quot;If I were like you,&quot; Nao said. &quot;Pure like you, would I be able to bring 
salvation?&quot;

No. Purity was a distant memory for Nao. Even if she&#39;d never let the 
filthy men touch her with their sordid hands she was still tainted by 
her own past, her own sins. Her life was forfeit. However, there was one 
thing she could do. Yuuki Nao could at least save one life. 

Minagi Mikoto WAS meek. Yet, the earth had only delivered one heartbreak 
after another. She was slowly drowning because of the heart given to her 
by the so-called &quot;merciful&quot; God. Her would-be protector, Tokiha Mai was 
the source of her turmoil.

Nao&#39;s fists clenched at the very thought of that name. How many times 
had Mai played with her heart, led her by a rope around her neck, only 
to leave Mikoto tied to a wall, unfulfilled.

Had she not been in the &quot;Lord&#39;s House&quot; Nao would have spat out the bile 
she tasted in her mouth.

As Nao gathered her cleaning supplies and untied the kerchief which held 
back her red hair, the doors to the chapel creaked open. A vaguely 
familiar figure walked in, her face obscured by the sudden flood of 
sunlight. 

&quot;Excuse me, is the priest here?&quot; the girl asked hesitantly. &quot;I-I need 
someone to hear my confession.&quot;

As the familiar girl came forward Yuuki Nao smiled a smile much like 
the statue of the benevolent Holy Mother. This was truly a sign from 
Heaven. Her course was correct and the salvation of Minagi Mikoto would 
succeed.

For God had delivered the method of salvation to her.

&quot;All are welcome in the House of the Lord, Tokiha Mai-san&quot;
