<h1>Mai HiMACE (part 9 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/226.html">22671991</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/himace-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>The glass ceiling exploded inward with a deafening crash, raining down 
razor-edged splinters on the wooden floor below. A torrent of dry, baked 
air roared in through the open roof, tossing paper and glass fragments 
and knocking over the stacks of boxes, scorching the wooden rafters a 
charred black.

Mai looked up, face into the scalding hurricane, though it could do her 
no harm. Overhead hung a bulbous shape, like a deformed, tailless 
hammerhead shark, two giant egg-shaped pods on the stumps of severed 
fins and similar, smaller objects on the sides of its iconic head. 
Engines, downward-pitched, throwing out so much pressure that Mai felt 
her feet slipping on the wooden floor from a good ten or fifteen metres 
away.

&quot;What the fuck is that thing,&quot; yelled Natsuki, but it was lost in the 
howl of the jets.

The flat rear wall of the craft hinged up and out, revealing a series of 
metal rails built onto the smooth black inner surface. A small device 
like an overhead winch truck slid out along one rail and stopped, a 
thick black cable trailing loosely back into the interior of the 
aircraft. Out jumped a thickly armoured figure in a black combat suit.

First came a pair of knee-length heavy-duty black boots that hit the 
wooden floor with a resounding thud. The figure itself from the calves 
up was covered in thick padding, giving a slightly overweight 
appearance, panels of material wrapped around the body in sections like 
foam cladding round a network of pipes, all in the same dark matte grey. 
Around its waist was a sturdy black belt, no visible catch, laden with a 
single row of uniform rectangular pouches. The only other prominent 
feature was the helmet; jet black and bulbous, face obscured by a thick 
mask with a circular grille vent around mouth level and one luminescent 
green eyehole, the other instead a blunt cone of technological hardware 
protruding several centimetres from the face.

It was carrying in both hands what was undeniably an automatic shotgun.

Mai was already turning to run back toward the staircase back to the 
apartment when the first shot came. Thankfully, it was Natsuki who fired 
first. A sharp splinter of blue light ricocheted off the muzzle of the 
unknown figure&#39;s weapon, jarring it up and to one side.

There was an impossibly loud boom, and then everything went silent. Mai 
twisted as she pitched forward, her equilibrium scrambled by the sheer 
noise. A shower of hot pellets chewed a wide gash into one wall and blew 
out the adjacent window.

Everything was ringing. She scrambled to find her footing and just 
managed to summon up a protective barrier before the second shot belched 
forth, scattering shrapnel wildly about the room. The figure fired 
again, and again.

A flurry of blue slivers arrowed into the figure&#39;s left shoulder, 
leaving softly steaming gouges in the thick armour cladding. Natsuki hit 
feet-first with all the force of a small truck, knocking the armoured 
figure end over end across the room. She ducked her head down and 
somersaulted through the manoeuvre as a spray of bullets raced across 
the floor a hair&#39;s breadth behind her. Her shoulder hit the floor first, 
turning her tumbling into a sliding roll that brought her to the far 
wall on her back, upside-down, both weapons now drawn and trained up 
towards the new skylight. A second figure was already careening down the 
cable towards them, hefting a compact black submachine gun in one hand 
as it clutched the line with the other.

Two more followed but seconds behind, both focused on other problems. 
They didn&#39;t wait for their own boots to reach wooden floor before 
opening fire. Lead chewed into the floor and across the wall in a 
scattered pattern, tearing the stacked cardboard boxes into paper shreds 
and spilling their shattered contents about the room in pieces. One 
window went, then another. Several shots pinged against the metal 
staircase.

One bullet caught Mai in the hip, throwing her sideways like a 
well-swung bat to her side. The rest was a blur.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mai felt a searing bolt of pain in her left hip. It was almost as if 
someone had cut through the skin and stuck a red-hot metal plug into the 
gap. Which, she supposed, was technically accurate.

Being shot was not an enjoyable experience in any way, she noted. She 
would have to avoid it in future.

&quot;Mai!&quot; There was a sudden pressure about her upper region. Mai had to 
blink several times against the blinding sunlight in her eyes and the 
pain running in her veins before sight resolved itself from the blurred 
mess it had become. She found herself on her backside on the bare wooden 
floor, propped up against a wall, blood oozing out of the wound in her 
side and forming a slowly growing puddle beneath her. It was cold, but 
something soft was wrapped loosely around her, most likely a towel.

Natsuki drew back quickly, with an expression that completely betrayed 
the deep concern that threatened to overcome her. She swiped away the 
trailing moisture from the redhead&#39;s cheeks with the back of two 
fingers, a touch that lingered slightly longer than it should have.

&quot;Shit,&quot; she cursed, biting her lip. &quot;For a minute there you had me 
worried, you bitch.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Mai pouted. A finger in her breastbone silenced any further 
comments.

&quot;You got shot in the side, Tokiha. I watched you fly like a beanbag. I 
have a right to be a little perturbed by something like that.

Mai could only chuckle. &quot;Must have looked pretty silly. Never could jump 
very far by myself.&quot;

&quot;Only because you&#39;d give yourself a black eye,&quot; retorted Natsuki, poking 
the redhead&#39;s chest again. She tried to hold the self-conscious humour 
on her face, but her eyes refused to stop watering.

&quot;What?&quot; Mai blinked. &quot;What is it? I&#39;m not dead, am I?&quot;

What happened next was no fault on either of them. At first it had been 
simply an instinctive release of emotion, the sudden surge of anxiety 
that rushed around Natsuki&#39;s brain overwhelmed her momentarily and urged 
her body into motion before she knew what it was doing. Their lips met 
for a moment or two, urgent, but unyielding. A tension she hadn&#39;t even 
been aware of came rushing out all at once, like a cistern full of 
crippling emotion being flushed away. It broke away after a moment&#39;s 
pause and the two of them were left staring dumbly at one another with a 
shared expression of relief, Mai&#39;s tinted by a faint pink across her 
cheeks. As if that were the end of it.

&quot;Don&#39;t look at me like that. You know what...&quot;

Natsuki startled to find her hand now against the other woman&#39;s head, 
cupped behind one delicate ear. She couldn&#39;t stop herself if she tried, 
and she certainly wasn&#39;t trying. She kissed Mai hard and furious, but 
adrenaline and shock quickly gave way altogether. Soon she was kissing 
just for the sake of the contact, and it was wonderful. Her heart had 
stopped pounding like an over-stimulated squirrel and her head wasn&#39;t 
spinning any more.

They separated much more slowly, almost reluctantly, lips parted 
slightly. Moisture stretched across the gap for just a second, as if 
trying to hold them together. Natsuki felt rational thought slipping 
away from her like a dream evaporating in the daylight. She slid her 
arms completely round the redheaded woman&#39;s body, heedless of the towel 
that was now coming loose again. They kissed a third time, neither quite 
sure who had started it, much more slowly and gently than the first two, 
inching forward experimentally with eyes half-lidded until their noses 
touched and then tipped aside. Head twisted slightly, Mai uttered only a 
soft breath of a sigh before her mouth was suddenly too busy to do 
anything else.

Again, they parted. This time, the dark-haired woman leaned back onto 
her ankles, giving them at least an arm&#39;s length between them. Mai 
opened her mouth to protest as a palm cupped softly at her cheek and 
found no words to say stop. The first kiss had abruptly sent all the 
years of mental blocks and self-assured reasoning crumbling away like a 
pile of leaves in a strong wind. The second had set her on fire 
somewhere deep inside, a sensation she hadn&#39;t felt in a long time 
indeed.

&quot;So...&quot;

Mai was still lost to that lingering burn deep within, warm and slow, 
like a fiery blanket wrapped around her insides. She almost missed what 
was said.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; she answered, blinking off the hormone-induced haze and trying 
to stifle her blushing. &quot;What was that?&quot;

&quot;A hotel,&quot; Natsuki repeated, not hiding her own reddened cheeks. &quot;We&#39;re 
going to have to find a hotel.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Mai giggled self-consciously, rubbing a hand to the back of her 
head. &quot;I guess we are.&quot;

&quot;Erm...&quot; Natsuki scrambled for something valid. Her head was suddenly 
empty. For all of the excuse, the arguments and apologies she&#39;d worked 
on in the back of her mind for who knew how long, when the moment came, 
nothing seemed quite the right thing to say. &quot;I...just glad you&#39;re 
okay.&quot;

Mai nodded quietly, her gaze falling to her injured hip. The shallow 
wound was already sealing itself up before her eyes, and a small lump of 
softly glowing metal sat like a squashed egg on the wooden floor, a 
patch of charred blackness surrounding it. The redhead blinked. &quot;Wow. 
Okay, that&#39;s new.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s new?&quot;

&quot;I can melt bullets,&quot; chirped Mai enthusiastically, with that stupid 
little feline grin on her face again. &quot;Bullet-proof Mai!&quot;

Natsuki gave a sigh half relief and half exasperation. &quot;Idiot.&quot;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was midday, or thereabouts, judging solely from the position of the 
sun in the sky, and all was not well. Then again, that was to be 
expected.

Whoever those strange men were, they weren&#39;t very good shots. Not that 
it would have mattered if they had been when they were trying to chase 
down an android and two not quite humans.

In any case, none of that was important any more, as Nina was rapidly 
discovering. The mechanical woman had been leading the two of them 
through the fairly deserted park behind the hotel at a truly frightening 
speed with several ominously black, unmarked cars in close pursuit. 
Every now and then, an innocent plant would meet a rather unpleasant end 
in a burst of hot lead. Contrary to common sense, which would usually 
dictate that running around in public shooting randomly would be a bad 
idea, those mysterious men with the automatic weapons were very keen on 
using them given the slightest encouragement. The only way to tell if 
they were gaining any ground on the strange men was a brief moment of 
quiet between barrages.

Nina felt like her lungs were trying to escape through her throat and 
her heart seemed just about ready to explode inside her ribcage. Every 
time one foot hit the ground again it sent a tremor right through her 
body all the way to her ears, which were already ringing so loudly that 
hearing even the gunshots was getting difficult. Thankfully, the android 
woman had offered no further instructions, and Arika had stopped 
screaming several minutes earlier. Just run. Run and run and keep 
running. Run till your legs fall apart. And in the end, it was futile.

Stay on the ground, and they&#39;d eventually be caught. Take to the air and 
they&#39;d still be caught, if not simply shot down on sight. Miyu had very 
briefly mentioned a defence system of some kind, and Nina decided she 
really didn&#39;t want to find out what it did.

And she ran. She threw herself forward onto each foot with all her 
strength just to keep going. How big was this stupid park anyway? No 
time to look around to see where the other two had gotten to, not that 
she could see much at all past the tears in her eyes, now that breath of 
fire shooting up and down her spine every time she took another step. 
She never saw the cliff.

Before she knew what was going on, Nina was barely an arm&#39;s length away 
from the edge of the world, looking out over the ocean far below. Only a 
short metal barrier marked the precipice, nowhere near tall enough to 
stop her now. Her knees collided with the corrugated metal sheeting with 
a horrible crack that made her whole body tingle, and over she went 
headfirst past the barrier. Nosedived over the edge of the cliff, a 
face-full of cold sea air, opal blue filled her vision. And then...

...and then, something really weird happened.

Time melted. Reality collapsed on itself and sucked her in along with 
it. Darkness became light, then infinity. The universe undulated around 
her like a giant bowlful of jelly during an earthquake. Something went 
pop.

Nina hit the ground nose-first, and yelped as pain erupted across her 
face. The rest of her body followed obediently as gravity took hold and 
she landed on her belly on cold concrete with a weak thump.

She lay there for a good long while, curled up on her side with both 
hands over her face. Perhaps just to make sure that the universe wasn&#39;t 
going to do anything else really...weird. Just what it was that had 
happened was still beyond her. Perhaps that was for the best. She 
finally looked up.

They weren&#39;t coming for her any more. Those strange men with the guns 
were gone. The park was gone too. It was dark, and there was concrete 
beneath her, reassuringly solid. Her vision was still a little hazy from 
the running, from the pain, from that strange trip through the universe. 
Arika was gone. The android was gone.

Everything. Everything was gone.

Nina curled herself up into a ball, arms wrapped around her knees tight 
to her chest, head down, trying not to hyperventilate. Her heart 
gradually stopped hammering away in her chest like a demented 
hummingbird, and her diaphragm relaxed. Her thighs were starting to 
cramp now, but it didn&#39;t matter.

Eventually, she passed out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nina woke up again some indeterminable time later with the worst 
headache she had ever experienced and a horrible sensation in the back 
of her mind, like something really bad had just happened but she 
couldn&#39;t quite say what. Before she could really give it much thought, 
Arika landed on top of her.

They were safe. It was late evening. An apartment. Arika was wearing a 
short green dress. Miyu appeared to have disappeared again. A television 
played quietly to itself in one corner of the small, cheaply furnished 
room.

&quot;Where,&quot; Nina began, cut off again. She reached up to put her hands on 
the redhead&#39;s shoulders and gently pushed her back far enough to give 
herself a little breathing room. &quot;Where is this,&quot; she repeated.

Arika kissed her again anyway before replying, &quot;I&#39;m not sure. Miyu 
brought us here.&quot; Her mouth moved silently for a moment, and then closed 
again. She turned and settled herself onto the bed beside Nina with a 
hand in her lap; the other invariably reached out to run the tips of her 
fingers up and down along Nina&#39;s arm. &quot;You were asleep for a long time,&quot; 
she muttered at last. &quot;You&#39;re okay now, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Nina insisted. She turned her attention to the wall as her 
face became hot.

&quot;Good.&quot;

Nina blinked. The tone of Arika&#39;s voice wasn&#39;t as energetic or cheerful 
as usual. The redhead was staring down at the floor while her fingers 
played over Nina&#39;s skin with an absent-minded lightness. Her head bowed 
in silent contemplation, eyes on the grey stone floor under her feet, 
the normally tightly bound mass of orange-red hair fell down in a thick 
sheet, obscuring Arika&#39;s face.

&quot;A...Arika?&quot; Nina levered herself up on one hand and reached up to brush 
that hair aside with the back of her fingers. Her nails whispered across 
the redhead&#39;s cheek. &quot;Arika,&quot; she repeated more firmly.

&quot;Mmm,&quot; replied Arika absently.

&quot;Is there something wrong?&quot;

Arika turned slowly toward her, eyes still unfocused. Nina met her gaze 
as her palm touched the redheaded girl&#39;s cheek. For a moment, something 
uncomfortable passed between them, and was gone in an instant.

&quot;I guess I just...&quot; she began, trailed off, fell silent once more and 
averted her gaze. Nina, rather surprisingly, cupped her partner&#39;s cheek 
and turned the girl&#39;s face back to her, until their eyes were level once 
again. She felt the heat under her palm, Arika&#39;s face turning a soft 
shade of pink. &quot;I just...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Arika blinked, confusion reading clearly on her face.

&quot;Fo...why?&quot;

&quot;For not saying it when I should have,&quot; replied Nina with the best 
resentful smile she could manage, given that her face felt like it was 
on fire from her hair to her collarbone. Arika only gave a soft, 
half-hearted whimper of an answer, and put her arms loosely around the 
dark-haired girl&#39;s neck. She buried her face into the edge of Nina&#39;s 
shoulder and breathed heavily.

&quot;I know it&#39;s stupid,&quot; Arika mumbled after a while. Her face was still 
pressed against the other girl&#39;s shoulder region, roughly, though she 
had shifted her head several times over the course of some minutes and 
now her chin was just resting above the edge of Nina&#39;s breast. She 
closed her eyes again and rubbed her cheek against that smooth skin, 
clutching slightly tighter around Nina&#39;s neck. &quot;I don&#39;t even know why, I 
just suddenly...I guess it just struck me all at once. I got so scared.&quot;

Nina put her arms around the redhead&#39;s shoulders and rested her cheek 
against the top of Arika&#39;s head, her nose buried into that thick 
red-orange hair; she remained silent.

&quot;I just...didn&#39;t have time to really stop and think about it 
before...I&#39;m not sure I like this place. It&#39;s not safe here, for either 
of us.&quot; She paused. &quot;For you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just as strong as you,&quot; Nina argued, briefly wondering why.

Arika put a hand to her chest in a fist. &quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; she stuttered. 
&quot;I can&#39;t stop thinking about what might happen if they find us again. I 
don&#39;t want to lose you...&quot;

At something of a loss for words, Nina improvised with whatever she 
could think of. Her hand moved back to Arika&#39;s cheek, gently tipping the 
redhead&#39;s face up to look her in the eye again. She couldn&#39;t bring 
herself to give the kind of reassuring smile she had seen so many times, 
but she could feel her face glowing red well enough. Sapphire eyes 
sparkled with moisture.

&quot;Ni...Nina...&quot; the words escaped her lips. A shiver up her spine.

&quot;I love you.&quot;

Arika closed her eyes as a tear rolled down her cheek. Her lips were 
caught before she could show a smile. Her hands gripped tighter around 
Nina&#39;s neck, and she kissed back with a passion.

&quot;Ni-na...&quot;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was dark, it was hot, and it was raining. It was dark because it was 
insanely early in the morning, somewhere between midnight and what was 
referred to mainly by the military as &quot;stupid o&#39; clock.&quot; Not a trace of 
sunlight to be seen; not to the west out across the roiling ocean waves 
that hissed as they swept up and down the beach like the breathing of a 
giant snake. Not landward, over the ragged mountain range that lurched 
up away from the coastline, a giant row of serpent&#39;s fangs piercing up 
out of the sea. The forest was silent in the black of night, not a bird 
or insect to be heard, only the rustle of wind and the incessant hissing 
of torrential rain through the ancient treetops.

It was hot because it was late summer and the island was in a 
sub-tropical weather zone a good deal south of mainland Japan. The 
forest floor was mostly a thick carpet of detritus, primarily dead 
leaves and decaying plant life. The air was much warmer and wetter here, 
south past the tip of Kyushu Island, days from any real civilisation in 
the wilderness of one of the smaller China Sea islands. A well kept, 
though seldom used roadway curved around the sheer concrete wall that 
had been built up on the ocean&#39;s edge and wound its way right around the 
island, serving as sole connection between the commercial harbour on the 
side closer the mainland and the small village nestled in the depths of 
the forest on the ocean-bound shore.

It was raining because, well, nature was just a bitch like that.

The sky was an infinite plain of featureless black, dark clouds packed 
into a thick layer that blanketed the earth in every direction for as 
far as the eye could see, blotting out the vast starscape beyond. Like 
an ocean of black, rolling waves of cloud mirrored the treacherous 
waters below. Flickers of blinding light crackled and spat, racing 
across the sky like wild animals; momentary bursts of brightness that 
cast horrible shadows through the trees below. Thunder boomed in the 
distance like the footfalls of a crazed dancing giant. The rain was 
hissing down in thick sheets, drenching everything, turning the forest 
floor into a disgusting sludge, flooding the road in several places so 
deep that passage would be impossible, misting up the air like a thick 
fog until visibility was all but nil.

Midori put her face to the ground and tugged the hood of her cape up 
tight over her head again as another wave of rain came over her, 
hammering into her back through the thick waterproof material and 
turning the ground on which she lay into a churning swamp. She had 
probably picked the single worst spot from which to observe; facedown on 
the bare forest floor a hundred metres or so up the side of a hill. On 
the other hand, they&#39;d have even less chance of ever spotting her up 
here, where the brown-and-green mottled cape blended with the background 
so perfectly, disguising her as part of the dense undergrowth. When the 
worst of the torrent had passed and the rain was easing off again, she 
raised the binoculars to her eye and tracked back on her target.

Down below at the foot of the hill, right down at the water&#39;s edge, the 
artificial cliff that ringed the whole island had been extended a good 
few hundred metres inland, all solid concrete in a wide semi-circle upon 
which stood roughly a dozen buildings of varying shapes and sizes. Most 
were straightforward, flat-roofed blocks of the same ugly grey concrete, 
squat and roughly squared in shape, with few windows, heavy metal doors, 
ensnared in webs of black piping and cables. There was a water tower on 
one side of the compound, a narrow three-storey building covered in 
air-scoops like giant silvery seashells all facing down towards the 
water, and a high wire fence running all around with a checkpoint at 
either end of the road through; just a small concrete hut with a wooden 
barrier. There were no outdoor lights, and no signs of life.

Beyond the southern point, nestled in a steep natural cove surrounded by 
towering mountain on all three sides, was another artificial compound a 
good deal bigger than the village. A rectangular section had been cut 
out of the beach and up through the coastal edge, lined with thick 
concrete walls, deepened down until it could comfortably dock any ship 
of reasonable size. Beside the wet dock was a large two-storey building 
that defied identification, being simply utilitarian and formless, and 
separate by a hundred metres or so across the road was a small hangar. 
The fence around the whole compound was two layers thick, with a deep 
trench in the intervening space, and high-rise metal frame towers at 
regular intervals around the perimeter.

&quot;Piece of shit.&quot; Midori fiddled with the binoculars some more. Damn but 
if they hadn&#39;t tried their hardest to make the things impossible to use. 
She had almost considered actually reading the handbook, but on 
reflection it had probably been better not to. Time was a luxury she 
could not afford to waste.

The world became green, and Midori grinned. At least the low-light 
function worked.

What she saw was definitely a military ship sitting in the dock, 
tethered in place by several thick cables along one side. Probably too 
tall for a frigate according to the recognition patterns she had 
programmed into her PDA. Just over two hundred metres bow to stern and 
from the waterline to the deck had to be at least ten, perhaps twenty at 
the most. It was difficult to see just how wide it was being at such a 
horrid angle, but the deck was easily visible. At first sight, the top 
deck was mostly a single flat rectangular plane that covered the entire 
hull. Halfway along the starboard side sat a block shaped tower, like a 
thick grey slab bolted to the deck on its end, adorned with all manner 
of pipes, cables, aerials and antennas of various shapes and sizes. A 
single row of windows stretched right around the upper quarter of the 
tower, tinted glass revealing nothing in the feeble morning light. What 
must have been a radar dish perched atop the tower on its own extended 
pylon, spinning constantly, along with several other bits of 
technological paraphernalia cluttering up the drab metal roof.

It was easy to see, comparatively small stature aside, that it was 
certainly no conventional aircraft carrier. At either fore corner, 
stretching out a short ways past the prow itself, a small platform not 
more than a few metres across supporting what looked suspiciously like 
an upright oil drum painted a lacklustre off-white, set into a pivoting 
cradle. Two more flanked the rear of the ship, and a fifth was set on a 
similar platform on the side opposite the tower. Only a single track ran 
the length of the ship; a precisely straight path from bow to stern 
marked out with two white lines and a central furrow cut into the metal, 
looking barely wide enough to accommodate most light aircraft. The rest 
of the space was taken up by six large squares cut into the deck set 
with concentric rings of slowly pulsing green lights, and two large 
rectangular blocks each the size of a small truck, topped off by a 
mosaic of uniform white square caps. Presumably missile tubes.

Two of the landing bays, those square sections of deck with what must 
have been landing lights on them, were empty. One was missing 
completely, just a square gap in the deck leading down into the dark 
unknown, or more likely, the hangar deck. The other two were currently 
occupied by a most peculiar aerial vehicle Midori had definitely never 
seen before. It looked like some sort of bizarre mutant hammerhead shark 
at first, just the front half, fins and eyes alike removed and replaced 
by omni-directional engine pods, larger in the back than up front. 
Instead of obeying normal aircraft convention, the upper surface was 
flat, while below the craft started off thin and sloped smoothly 
downward to become a bulbous oval shape at the back, as if someone had 
turned the vehicle upside-down. The design left it looking dangerously 
over-balanced, but it rested quite comfortably on four fat, stumpy 
hydraulic legs that extended from the floor of the cargo section, with 
only two skinny, retractable poles to keep it balanced in front. A long 
darkened panel set into the front ventral section of the craft 
presumably served as a cockpit, directing a pilot&#39;s attention forward 
and down instead of upward. The only visible armament was a small rotary 
cannon affixed via a circular a-frame turret under the left hand &quot;wing&quot; 
that looked completely out of place, as if it had been slapped on as an 
afterthought.

The recognition program in Midori&#39;s PDA drew a blank. She cursed under 
her breath, wary of being too verbose lest she end up with a mouthful of 
muddy rainwater. Not that it mattered anyway; she was already soaked 
through underneath the cape, wet clothing adhering to her skin like 
paper in the hot, muggy tropical air.

She brought one hand up to her head while the other held the binoculars 
trained on her target. Wrapped around her left ear like a small black 
plastic crescent moon was a headset communication device; a blunt 
conical plug inserted into her ear and a small, wire-thin retractable 
antenna stood up through Midori&#39;s soaking hair along the side of her 
head. Midori pressed two fingers to the device and got a quiet blip in 
reply.

&quot;Testing,&quot; she muttered in a very low voice, almost inaudible. Her own 
words echoed back faintly in her ear from the stick-thin microphone arm 
that practically adhered to her face, curving down from her ear to just 
below the corner of her mouth. &quot;Can you hear me out there?&quot; The earpiece 
gave a hissing crackling noise for a moment, and then a voice warbled 
through, broken and distorted but recognisable.

&quot;Your signal is coming through one hundred percent. Go ahead.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d better be recording this.&quot; There was a short pause before the 
reply.

&quot;Go ahead.&quot;

Midori breathed deeply. &quot;Okay, I&#39;ve been here about four hours by now, 
no signs of activity on the ground. Got a ship in dock, looks like a 
Marine carrier. Can&#39;t get a good look but it doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s a 
flag or any insignia anywhere.&quot; Her fingers fumbled over the top of the 
binoculars for a moment, searching over several rows of small buttons 
until she found the right one. &quot;Okay, I&#39;m uploading the feed to you 
right now. Something really top secret going on here and I have no idea 
what those things are.&quot; There was a brief pause, processing lag, before 
the reply came.

&quot;Experimental aircraft for the military. Could this be a NATO taskforce? 
Perhaps the JASDF are buying foreign equipment as well now?&quot;

&quot;It could be them.&quot;

&quot;It would probably be wisest not to jump to costly conclusions.&quot;

Midori snorted derisively.

&quot;If you are unable to give a positive identification, perhaps measures 
should be taken to obtain more information before casting ungrounded 
assumptions.&quot;

Midori sighed reluctantly. &quot;I suppose you&#39;re right. There are forces at 
work here that go beyond the District.&quot; The thought sent a shiver down 
her spine. &quot;Whatever&#39;s going on here involves people within the UN armed 
forces. There aren&#39;t many people who even know about the project with 
that kind of influence.&quot;

&quot;There may be one or two I can identify, at that...&quot;

Midori interrupted with a silencing hiss. Through the incessant roar of 
the rain and the crackling of thunder overhead came another noise, one 
that was most definitely artificial. At first, it was the sound of a 
distant jackhammer, a clamour of rapid-fire bangs that melted into a 
single constant roar. The noise hammered into Midori&#39;s skull like a bad 
headache as it approached from somewhere behind her, rushing over the 
nearest hill like the droning buzz of an angry swarm of wasps, louder 
and louder with every passing second. Soon enough, it was practically on 
top of her, so intense that it made her ears hurt.

It swooped overhead like a gigantic bird of prey diving on an 
unsuspecting meal, with the droning roar of its engines trailing behind. 
As soon as the overpressure lessened to a bearable degree, Midori stuck 
her head up again and focused the night-vision binoculars to the sky.

The strange craft looked, for all intents and purposes, almost identical 
to those odd vehicles that sat on the carrier now inert, all but for a 
few small cosmetic differences. Where the others were all a uniform 
shade of dull silver-grey, this one was jet black, so dark that it was 
difficult to keep track of even with night-vision to aid feeble human 
eyes. The only way to really spot the thing as it flew over the island 
was the blindingly hot wake it churned into the turbulent air, bending 
the tops of trees and throwing up huge clouds of dead leaves from the 
forest floor. It was moving at considerable speed across the canopy, 
barely metres above the trees, bobbing and weaving lazily along its 
flight path much like a bird, twitching its way from side to side to 
stay on course. With the very manner in which it moved, swerving away 
from any particularly high tree in its path or the constant minor course 
corrections, it was easy to forget the thing was artificial; it moved 
almost like an oversized bird.

The other striking difference between the other aircraft and this one 
individual was the engines, or what Midori assumed were engines. They 
could have been anything really; they looked like four short, fat, 
segmented tubes, two smaller at the front and larger ones at the back, 
which blended seamlessly into the strangely shaped fuselage, furthering 
the organic appearance of the thing. Each one was curved to a slight 
bulb at the end, forming a circular aperture from whence came belching 
forth high-speed jets of scorching hot air. Each aperture could be 
widened or constricted by flexing the walls of the bulbous segment, 
resulting in all kinds of shapes no doubt to influence the flow of 
exhaust in various ways, demonstrated as the craft narrowly avoided a 
collision with a tall treetop by gliding round in a smooth diagonal 
drift.

Midori watched in silence as the aircraft descended on the awaiting 
carrier, nose dangerously low, not even bothering to slow its approach. 
The deck crew were nowhere to be seen at that point, but there was a 
small cluster of people standing by the tower, watching the incoming 
craft. A smudge of dark lime-greenish shapes resolved into crystal 
clarity; five bodies, all tall enough and muscular enough to be military 
stereotypes, following on in a loose arrow formation. They were led by a 
surprisingly short figure in what looked like a Hawaiian shirt and loose 
shorts, a thick mop of lightly coloured hair set in an unruly spiked 
mess.

That short, pointed nose and narrow eyebrows that gave a slender, boyish 
face a hint of devilish mischief were all too familiar even at a glance. 
Scarlet gaze turned a misty pale green-grey from the low light 
binoculars drifted leisurely skyward. As always, the first expression to 
grace the young boy&#39;s lips was a playful grin, obscuring a most sinister 
smirk behind the fa&#135;ade of youthful innocence.

The incoming aerial craft lurched downward, dropping toward the deck as 
if its strings had just been cut. It pitched violently backward, nose 
rising almost to forty degrees as its fore engines flared in wide, hot 
jets of flame. The short rear pneumatic feet expressed from its rearward 
underbelly and hit the deck plating, pivoting the aircraft forward to 
rest horizontal. Two more feet spread out from beneath, short, powerful 
suspension stocks with wide pads, emerging from the forward edge of its 
lower body instead of the ungainly spindle legs of the other craft. As 
it settled, the lack of blatantly artificial gear maintained the organic 
appearance even further, regardless of how overbalanced it looked at 
first glance, as if ready to topple forwards at any moment. The rear 
door pivoted upward, and then folded in on itself concertina style in 
three neat sections.

The young boy with the well-armed and military trained entourage spared 
no glance about the carrier or its surroundings as he stepped up into 
the craft. The grunts shuffled in after him, single file, and the door 
quickly flicked itself shut.

A string of obscenities hissed from Midori&#39;s lips. &quot;That little...&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s him,&quot; she growled into the microphone. &quot;He&#39;s here.&quot;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At a time far too early to be considered sane, the sun was rising once 
again over the city of Tokyo. It was a truly incredible sight; the rays 
of blinding golden light towering skyward from the horizon, illuminating 
the landscape in sharp relief. The city was a playground of shadow and 
light, sparkling gold and deepest black, twisting and turning, a 
shifting battle in slow motion as the sun crawled higher and higher in 
the early morning sky. Away in the distance was the city centre, a 
gathering of monoliths vast and ancient, rising from the cluttered 
sprawl of insignificant armies asleep at their feet, indomitable towers 
of artificiality standing dark and defiant against the abrasive 
sunlight.

Mai watched in silence, half-awake and caught entranced by the 
spectacular display. Her eyes filled with fire, drinking in the 
incredible light like a black hole sucking down a star. Violet turned 
slowly to crimson, a deep burnished golden orange, then yellow as the 
sun itself. Then white, a vibrant glow of inner luminescence. At last, 
she blinked against the harsh sunrise, and the dazzling light show 
suddenly became a headache-inducing mess of greens and blues on the back 
of her eyelids. She brought a hand to her face to shield the sunlight 
pouring in through the wide caf&#130; window and lowered her eyes to the 
table in front of her, trying to banish the annoyingly vivid display of 
neon colour assaulting her vision.

That was when it happened.

Suddenly, she felt dizzy. Colour, so sharp and clear it was almost 
blinding, blossomed behind her eyes. The golden-yellow glare of sunlight 
streaming down through the tall buildings surrounding the caf&#130; exploded, 
swept away the deep morning shadows with all the intensity of midday 
sun. Light spots swarming in her vision faded away, replaced by 
impossibly vibrant colour, as if someone had switched all the world&#39;s 
contrast filters all the way up. A dim, faded indigo sky turned a loud 
sapphire blue; the greyish concrete, speckled with golden sunlight, 
became a perfect white; the burnished bronze tablecloth in front of her 
shone like a miniature sun.

Then someone walked past the caf&#130; window and Mai&#39;s world exploded all 
over again. She could make out every detail, every millimetre of cloth, 
every tiny flake of skin on the man&#39;s body as he strolled obliviously 
past. Even the murky brown-grey of his suit was so bold, so clear, so 
powerful that it looked every bit as bright as the blazing tablecloth. 
But beyond that, in some way she couldn&#39;t quite grasp, Mai saw colours. 
Colours she couldn&#39;t even name, a hazy glow that was beyond red, a 
shimmer of purple that defied explanation, emanating from that 
unsuspecting human body like an oversized firefly.

She blinked.

Slowly, softly, the world returned to normal, but only if she 
concentrated. The insane colours dimmed to nothing and light crept back 
to where it was meant to be, away from her sensitive eyes, away from the 
shadows and gloom around the buildings. Compared to the 
headache-inducing image she had just received, Mai found the high 
contrast glare of the rising sun almost relaxing.

Her eyes were watering, she noticed, and reached for a napkin. Only then 
did it fully occur to her that that arm was still stuck in place, wedged 
between the back of the booth seating and a surprisingly heavy, 
dark-haired woman. Natsuki snorted loudly in her sleep as she was shoved 
forwards, shifting against the redhead&#39;s side with an incoherent mumble.

Mai felt a smile coming on. A good one. She hadn&#39;t felt that in quite a 
while now, not with the recent chaos in her life, having to balance 
work, fighting and looking after an incredibly demanding young girl. She 
threw the discontent aside and reached up her free hand to brush along 
the side of Natsuki&#39;s shoulder with a finger.

&quot;Yukariko&#39;s going to eat you for breakfast if you don&#39;t get up soon,&quot; 
she told the sleeping woman in a half-whispered voice. It was something 
of a struggle not to laugh.

Natsuki shot upright in a second, still semi-conscious, eyes unfocused, 
and yelped something completely incoherent in horrendously garbled 
English. Then she blinked. Someone was laughing somewhere behind her and 
she had a good idea who it was.

&quot;Bitch,&quot; she barked at the redhead, and punched her in the arm. &quot;You&#39;re 
an evil person, Tokiha.&quot;

Mai ignored her and kept on laughing, rubbing her upper arm with one 
hand. &quot;You&#39;re just so easy to tease, Natsuki,&quot; she breathed between 
gasps. &quot;It&#39;s not my fault it&#39;s funny!&quot; The hiccupping giggles eventually 
boiled down to a snicker, while Natsuki focused her attention resolutely 
on the tablecloth in front of her, fuming silently.

&quot;You&#39;re evil,&quot; she insisted, pouting in a way only she knew how. Mai 
draped an arm over her shoulders again and leaned in close, cheek almost 
touching Natsuki&#39;s ear.

&quot;You really never change, Kuga, not in ten years.&quot; She let out a long 
sigh and shook her head, trying to calm herself down again. Her spare 
hand landed limply on the table next to five empty cups of coffee and a 
plate smeared with cheese sauce and thinly scattered with crumbs of 
pasta.

&quot;Neither do you,&quot; replied the dark-haired woman in an oddly reminiscent 
tone of voice. She brought a hand up and caught Mai&#39;s hand on the table, 
fingers intertwined slowly. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Mai blinked. &quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;For being the only predictable thing around.&quot;

The redhead beamed back at her, even if the statement had brought an 
awkward redness to her cheek. &quot;My job,&quot; she stated proudly, and squeezed 
Natsuki&#39;s hand in what she hoped was a reassuring gesture.

&quot;E...excuse me...&quot;

Both women looked up quickly at the intruding voice. A waitress was 
standing at the end of their table; a frightfully ordinary yet 
attractive young girl just a head shorter than either of them, in the 
universally coveted maid&#39;s outfit, a clash of black-white monochrome and 
splashes of cool blue and bright yellow.

Natsuki averted her gaze, trying to hide the sudden flush in her cheeks 
with the usual deeply annoyed expression. Mai refused to let go of her 
hand, or remove herself from her partner&#39;s physical presence. The 
situation was an oddly familiar one, and infuriating, though strangely 
enjoyable.

&quot;Is there something wrong,&quot; asked the redhead in reply, putting on her 
most cheerful face. Hiding her own embarrassment was something she&#39;d had 
years of practice at.

&quot;Well...&quot; The waitress shuffled her feet and looked awkwardly back 
toward the kitchen where several others of her fellow staff were 
waiting, trying to look casual. &quot;It&#39;s just,&quot; she stuttered, 
&quot;...erm...how long did...I mean...&quot; For a brief while, she said nothing 
at all, just looking flustered and uncomfortable. &quot;Would...would you 
like to order something,&quot; she offered at last, looking rather pathetic.

Mai giggled, which only made the poor girl jump. &quot;I think we&#39;d like to 
see the breakfast menu, if that&#39;s alright? What do you say?&quot; She gave 
Natsuki&#39;s shoulder a nudge. The dark-haired woman responded with a 
dismissive grunt, refusing to face either of them.

The waitress bowed deeply, very deeply, until Mai could see a vast 
window of cleavage as the front of the dress fell open slightly. She 
made a highly suggestive noise and couldn&#39;t hold in the laughter as the 
poor young girl retreated with a flustered squeak.

&quot;You love doing that, don&#39;t you,&quot; muttered Natsuki, irate. &quot;You&#39;re going 
to get thrown out for sexual harassment if you keep that up.&quot;

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be silly. I only do it because she&#39;s so obviously attracted 
to you.&quot;

Natsuki span round to face her and fixed her with an angry glare. &quot;What 
are you talking about,&quot; she barked. &quot;Stop making up...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; Mai interrupted, her smile fading slowly. &quot;You really didn&#39;t 
notice?&quot;

Natsuki blinked, halted mid-protest.

&quot;You didn&#39;t notice the way she keeps looking at you whenever she comes 
over here?&quot; Mai slid her arm from around her partner&#39;s shoulders and 
reached out over the table to catch a little plastic spoon between her 
fingers, flicking it around in little circles. &quot;She likes you, Natsuki,&quot; 
she sang, a smug grin overtaking her features. &quot;She&#39;s just like little 
Yumika, remember?&quot;

&quot;Yumika was gay,&quot; Natsuki protested. The crimson in her cheeks 
immediately darkened.

&quot;They were all gay, and so were you,&quot; Mai pointed out in her annoying &#39;I 
know what I&#39;m talking about&#39; voice. &quot;Except the ones who were just there 
for the money. I swear, that place must have just been...just...built 
out of pure...gayness. And it made anyone who stayed for too long turn 
homosexual. Or something.&quot;

Natsuki gave her a very odd look.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;One of these days, you&#39;re going to say something that actually makes 
sense.&quot;

Mai just giggled and slid an arm round Natsuki&#39;s waist again, leaning in 
closer until their shoulders touched. &quot;Well even if she is batting for 
you...&quot;

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; protested the dark-haired woman with one eyebrow up and a 
not too pleased expression. She prodded a finger sharply into Mai&#39;s 
ribs.

&quot;...she can&#39;t take you away while I&#39;m here to stop her, can she? So 
don&#39;t worry.&quot; Mai beamed down at her in that impossibly cheerful way.

&quot;Somehow,&quot; Natsuki sighed lethargically, &quot;that doesn&#39;t make me feel 
better.&quot; She stretched both arms up over her head and arched her spine 
up high, wincing at several dull cracks from her lower back. &quot;In any 
case, I don&#39;t think we should just stay here all day.&quot;

Mai cocked her head to one side, looking down at her partner lopsidedly. 
&quot;Why not,&quot; she muttered with obvious resentment.

&quot;That car came back again,&quot; Natsuki explained with a tilt of her head 
towards the window. Mai followed her gaze out across the street to where 
a forest-green sedan was sitting edged up onto the pavement.

It had been there for almost five hours, not that anyone had taken any 
particular notice. It was a perfectly ordinary car; four doors, a design 
that was less than striking in any way, tinted glass in the windshield, 
two parallel black ridges along the smoothly sloped roof where a rack 
could be fitted. Double-wipers had been fitted on the front and back, 
and two small bolt-on washers just above the front bumper to spray water 
over wide square headlights, denoting a rather active lifestyle. A few 
patches of dried mud along the sides and splattered around the front 
wheels. The only occupant was a perfectly ordinary Japanese man with a 
slightly narrow nose and short-cropped hair, face hidden behind a pair 
of dark glasses that didn&#39;t look out of place at all on a sunny summer 
morning in Tokyo.

Mai tried not to look directly at him as he took a small black box about 
the size of a coffee mug from somewhere behind the dashboard and 
inspected the device for a moment before returning it to its place. She 
let out a long, heart-felt sigh and rested her chin atop folded arms on 
the table.

&quot;And I was beginning to like this place, too.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll get the bill,&quot; said Natsuki rather redundantly as she slid another 
credit card from a pocket inside the dark blue jacket she was wearing. 
&quot;I just hope we don&#39;t run out of cards,&quot; she continued as an aside, 
voice hushed. &quot;If we keep this up, it won&#39;t matter how rich I am, either 
they&#39;ll trace my card or we&#39;ll run out of accounts to use.&quot;

Mai rolled her head over to the other side to look up at her sidelong 
with a bored expression. &quot;We could always just use mine.&quot;

&quot;Dummy.&quot;

&quot;Hm?&quot; Mai sat up. &quot;Who&#39;re you calling dummy,&quot; she protested.

&quot;What makes you think they don&#39;t have your personal life under 
surveillance already, idiot?&quot;

The redhead blinked. &quot;Oh. Right.&quot; Then she sank back down to her 
previous position, chin on the tablecloth. &quot;Curse you and your 
inscrutable logic.&quot;

Natsuki left her to her own devices and focused on waving down one of 
the few passing waitresses. Now that the early hours had passed and the 
city was coming to life again, the caf&#130; was starting to get noisy again. 
The diminutive night shift were quickly becoming inadequate with the 
sudden influx of customers, and a queue was slowly gathering around the 
door.

&quot;I just hope Shizuru hasn&#39;t been having the same trouble.&quot;

&quot;Still blocked,&quot; replied Mai automatically. Her voice was oddly distant.

&quot;Damn phone company. Whoever these people are, they&#39;ve got connections 
in all the wrong places.&quot;

Mai wasn&#39;t listening. The man in the green car was moving. He was 
switching the engine off. Getting out. Reaching inside his jacket.

&quot;Shit...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

Mai was on her feet before her brain even had time to process the 
situation fully. The man was now walking away and leaving the car open 
behind him.

&quot;Get under the table.&quot;

Natsuki looked up at her with an incredulous expression.

&quot;Don&#39;t argue, just do it!&quot;

The strange man was taking his glasses off with one hand while the other 
was full of metal. He tossed them onto the pavement and ran straight 
across the road, heedless of the traffic, aiming an automatic pistol at 
something that Mai couldn&#39;t see.

Someone screamed.

Mai felt the air thicken around her as it happened again. Her vision 
exploded into vibrant colour. The man with the gun became crystal-sharp 
beyond the limits of human eyesight, wreathed in a thin bubble of deep 
red-orange haze like steam. For a moment, the metal of the pistol 
gleamed brightly in the morning sun. He took aim...

The window of the caf&#130; exploded outwards with an ear-splitting bang, 
throwing a shower of razor shards out into the road. The man held an arm 
up over his face and turned away from the sudden onslaught.

&quot;Fuck!&quot;

Mai turned her head briefly back to her partner. &quot;Stay down,&quot; she yelled 
at the dark-haired woman crouched under the table. Her lavender eyes 
flickered brightly. Steam hissed from her nostrils as she panted, 
open-mouthed. Whatever it was, it was taking hold. Hard.

A wild combination of fear and confusion and excitement set Natsuki&#39;s 
heart racing and her senses on overload. She clutched her fingers tight 
around her weapons as they materialised obediently in her hands. Heat 
radiated in waves from the redheaded woman now standing atop the 
cluttered table. The caf&#130; patrons were all yelling at one another and 
scrambling back and forth, or cowering under tables, or trying to see 
what was happening.

A mysterious figure in a heavy brown cloak walked in front of the blown 
out caf&#130; window. The figure ignored a rather irate Mai glaring at the 
gun-toting man still standing in the middle of the road and turned to 
the agent himself instead.

A lightning flash of pink shook Mai from her narrow-minded fury. The man 
with the gun staggered backwards, clutching at his stomach. Blood 
squirted between his fingers.

&quot;Mai!&quot;

The figure turned. The hood of that thick, dark cloak was completely 
black inside, obscuring any facial features.

Mai blinked. A hand was tugging urgently at her left leg. She looked 
down and saw Natsuki&#39;s face behind her, mouth agape, yelling something 
at her.

&quot;Mai, get off the-&quot;

&quot;Tokiha!&quot;

Mai watched wide-eyed as a swarm of writhing pink limbs spewed out from 
the folds of that thick cloak and started reaching towards her. The hood 
flew back to reveal an unnervingly familiar face.

&quot;Shiho?&quot;

&quot;Bitch,&quot; screamed the pink-haired girl, and leapt towards her. Her hair 
lunged out like a tangle of angry tentacles.

&quot;Run, idiot!&quot; A sharp cobalt flash sliced across the cloaked girl&#39;s 
flight-path, stopping Shiho in her tracks. Mai shook her head, staggered 
backwards across the table.

&quot;What...&quot;

Natsuki shoved her right off the table, sending the redhead sprawling on 
the floor.

&quot;Run!&quot; She fired off across Shiho&#39;s nose again.

So Mai ran.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Ni-na.&quot;

At least they had actual shoes now, so no running around barefoot in the 
city. Besides the fact that it hurt after very long, it also looked 
awfully suspicious to the average passer by to see two teenage girls 
running around with bare feet in the middle of Tokyo.

&quot;Ni-na...&quot;

The black flat-soles made a rhythmic taptaptap on the pavement as they 
walked briskly along the street, keeping themselves toward the early 
morning shadows. Arika&#39;s soft shoes were more or less silent, but her 
mouth made up for that by a good margin.

&quot;Nina,&quot; she whined for about the tenth time. &quot;Where are we going?&quot;

&quot;We have to get away.&quot; Nine kept her head down and her feet moving.

&quot;From what?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, just...just be quiet and walk!&quot;

In the end, they had ditched most of what had been salvaged from the 
hotel room. A pair of rather baggy blue jeans that didn&#39;t quite fit 
right and a pale yellow short-sleeved blouse fit Arika neatly in with 
the crowd, with the flip-down shades and the white soft-soled shoes that 
made her look like any decent fashion-accessory teenage girl. A narrow 
blue pouch belt sat lopsidedly across her hips, bulging with what little 
money she had left and whatever else she could stuff into it. The rest, 
food, map of the city, compass, day ticket for the metro trains, and 
other assorted items, were all crammed into the smallest olive green 
backpack that would fit, weighing heavily on Arika&#39;s slender young 
shoulders. A canteen dangled from a clip on the side, whacking her in 
the back now and again.

&quot;Okay, why are we running?&quot; She was whining. She didn&#39;t care; it was 
definitely a situation worth whining about.

&quot;Because...&quot; Nina hesitated, though she didn&#39;t slow down. The thin 
fabric of a dark aquamarine dress swished around just below her knees. 
She had wrapped herself up in a light, sea green button-up sweater to 
keep the sun off her bare shoulders and arms. Her own bag at least 
meshed a little better with her outfit; an underarm bag in a slightly 
paler grassy shade of green hanging down against her right hip. She was 
sweating lightly under the cool dress, so that the back of the skirt 
tended to cling to the backs of her thighs on occasion. &quot;Look, just 
trust me, okay?&quot;

Arika tried not to stare at the view of Nina&#39;s rear end through the thin 
fabric and kept walking. &quot;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t trust you,&quot; she reasoned 
with the usual pout in her voice. &quot;I just don&#39;t really understand why 
we&#39;re running away without telling Miyu where we&#39;re going.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t trust that woman,&quot; Nina replied quite bluntly. Arika blinked 
and halted for a moment.

&quot;What...why not?&quot; Then she noticed the dark-haired girl was getting away 
from her and hurried to catch up again. &quot;I&#39;ve already told you, she&#39;s a 
friend! She wouldn&#39;t be misleading us or anything, I promise.&quot;

Nina sighed. &quot;Not everyone can be as openly trusting as you, Arika. I 
wish I could...&quot;

A terrific BANG tore through the peaceful morning air, sending a flock 
of pigeons roosting in a nearby tree into a frenzied scramble of wings. 
Both girls froze in their tracks. Arika felt her heart beating faster 
already as she turned to identify the source of the offending noise.

&quot;That...what was...&quot;

&quot;Over there!&quot; And just like that, the redhead was dashing away across 
the street, leaving her companion somewhat bewildered behind her.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They arrived just in time to see a man in a dark suit collapse to the 
ground in a puddle of blood. A few random people were beginning to crowd 
round, despite the gun that now lay not a metre distant on the black 
ground. Someone yelled for an ambulance. Arika already thought she could 
just hear sirens in the distance.

They emerged from an alleyway leading back between two small storefront 
buildings to the next street over. A dark green car was parked right 
across the alley with one wheel edged up onto the curb, and the driver&#39;s 
door hanging open.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

Nina shook her head. &quot;Looks like someone was shot, or something?&quot; She 
sidestepped back past the car and turned to leave when something caught 
her eye.

&quot;Well that&#39;s just weird,&quot; Arika postulated aloud. &quot;I mean, what was that 
man doing with a gun anyway? Is he some kind of police or something?&quot; 
She held up one finger. &quot;I know! It&#39;s like...some sort of television 
show or something! Maybe they&#39;re filming a movie, yeah.&quot;

Silence from her partner.

&quot;Um...Nina?&quot; The redhead turned with a mildly worried expression. &quot;Nina? 
Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Arika,&quot; replied the dark-haired girl very slowly, and pointed to the 
car. &quot;What is that?&quot;

Sitting on the back seat of the dark green mud-speckled car with the 
heavy-duty wipers and the multipurpose roof rack was something that 
looked, in some subconscious way that Nina didn&#39;t quite understand, as 
if it really didn&#39;t belong there. A large rectangular arm-bag took up 
one seat, looking ominous enough all by itself. On the other side was a 
setup that vaguely resembled a child&#39;s safety chair, securely fastened 
to the seat by a framework of legs that dove between the cushions. 
Instead of a seat, however, there was a brushed silver metal cube about 
a hand span across with an assortment of buttons and knobs and switches. 
Several thin rubberised wires lead to a device fixed to the top of the 
box that looked oddly like a miniature satellite dish.

&quot;Um...&quot; was Arika&#39;s only suggestion.

&quot;That doesn&#39;t really look...&quot;

A bleeping sound interrupted Nina mid-sentence. She looked around, 
momentarily startled, until Arika tapped her on the shoulder and pointed 
her towards a small black box-like device sitting in a cradle on the 
panel between the front seats.

A hand-held satellite phone, of course, would explain the dish in the 
back seat, but not the bag. More worrying...

...it was ringing.

Nina looked around. No one seemed too concerned with two young girls 
poking their noses around a strange car, for the time being, but the 
distant flash of police car lights along the road a ways were gradually 
getting closer.

&quot;We should go, Nina.&quot; Arika gave her sleeve a good firm tug. &quot;C&#39;mon, 
let&#39;s just leave it.&quot;

She couldn&#39;t. Nina was overcome by a feeling she couldn&#39;t put into 
words, as if she was meant to pick up that phone. As though it was for 
her that it was ringing.

She leaned into the car through the open passenger window, reached down 
to clutch the phone in her fingers and lifted it out of its cradle. The 
bleeping cut off with a sharp blip. She brought the thing to the side of 
her head and took a deep breath.

&quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Good morning, Miss Wang,&quot; answered a soft, deep voice on the other end.

She didn&#39;t know if she wanted to throw the thing away and run or just 
burst out laughing. This was getting weird.

&quot;Who...&quot; She licked her lips, her mouth suddenly dry. Arika was still 
clinging to her sleeve with an urgent look on her face.

&quot;When is the president not the president?&quot;

Nina blinked. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;When is the president,&quot; said the androgynous voice patiently, &quot;not the 
president?&quot;

&quot;Erm...I...&quot; Nina shook her head.

&quot;What&#39;s going on, Nina? Who is it?&quot;

Nina put a hand over the mouthpiece and looked back at her redheaded 
companion with a troubled expression. &quot;I don&#39;t know, it...&quot; Her brow 
furrowed in thought. &quot;I think...&quot;

&quot;You think...?&quot; Arika cocked her head slightly and gave her a decidedly 
bewildered look. &quot;What do you think?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Nina to both of them equally. &quot;When is the 
president not the president?&quot; Was she really playing a word game with an 
anonymous caller? And the day had started off so very normal.

The caller chuckled.

Nina pulled the phone away from her ear and looked at it, as if it had 
just spontaneously turned into a banana or some other such bizarre 
thing. &quot;What the...&quot;

&quot;What what what, what is it?&quot; Arika was now bouncing on her toes 
impatiently. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know...but I&#39;m sure I recognise that voice from somewhere, I 
know I do.&quot; Nina sighed, and took the phone to her ear again. The 
chuckling had stopped.

&quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;Well what,&quot; she replied. &quot;Whoever you are, why won&#39;t you answer me?&quot;

&quot;Hm?&quot;

Nina put a hand on her forehead and tried not to get angry. &quot;When is the 
president not the president?&quot; When the reply came, the amusement in that 
mysterious voice was dark, sinister, chilling.

&quot;When she&#39;s a spy.&quot;

The phone clicked.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a better light, she might have been an attractive young woman; she 
was relatively tall for her age, and of such slight build that one might 
dismiss her at first glance. Her face was as slender as the rest of her, 
with high cheekbones and a delicate, slightly upturned nose that gave 
her a demure, refined appearance. She was, from head to toe, a nubile 
young creature long in limb and in body, whose joints were almost bony 
and whose more blatantly feminine features had yet to develop past the 
athletic waif&#39;s figure of her youth. Her chest like her face was held 
high and firm out in front. Had she been so compelled, a seductive 
posture would look almost natural on her.

But she wasn&#39;t.

She stood with her feet a short distance apart, shoulders forward and 
her head dipped, eyes peeking out from behind sheer curtains of vibrant 
pinkish hair like a wild animal ready to strike without warning. Thick 
shadows overlapped across her semi-naked body, obscuring her features, 
breaking her silhouette like a camouflage pattern to the point that she 
appeared at least partly insubstantial, as if she wasn&#39;t really all 
there.

The only clothing she wore was a single spiral of fabric that started at 
her left ankle and ended at her right wrist. It began as a thick-soled 
sock on her left foot, purest black, slithering up her calf like a snake 
as it slowly thickened and changed colour. Even the texture was 
different by the time it reached her hips, a smooth emerald green 
leather strip a hand span wide that swept once across the backs of her 
thighs just below her buttocks, and then around her far hip to cross her 
groin region and continue upward, leaving her with what was inarguably 
the briefest skirt ever designed. From there it caressed its way up 
once, twice, thrice around her thorax as it ascended, much narrower 
strips of wafer thin fabric melting from a soft pink over her abdominal 
muscles to a pale blue across her lower ribs just under the curve of her 
breasts. Modesty had not been a primary concern, it seemed, as the 
strange fabric only barely managed to cover both nipples, each one 
crowded to the very edge of the diagonally slanted material that curled 
across her chest as a smooth, flexible opal strip. When it stretched 
across her shoulder blades and reached her right shoulder at last, it 
flowed straight out and began a similar coiling path down that arm, a 
uniform crimson down to her wrist, whereupon it swelled into a 
fingerless skin-tight glove. The overall effect, between the constantly 
moving shadows playing across her body and the winding fabric clearly 
not designed with concealment in mind, was almost migraine inducing in 
its hypnotic quality, furthering Shiho&#39;s passive camouflage by making it 
almost impossible to focus on her for any period of time without feeling 
dizzy.

Her hair just made the whole problem worse, of course. She had never cut 
it, not in the last ten years at least, as far as the eye could judge, 
for it flowed down her back in a single thick, pink mass to pool on the 
ground. That is, it would have, had she left it to its own devices. As 
it was, Shiho had gathered the whole mess up and tied it into four 
identical tails, condensing into itself so tightly that it formed four 
thick, curving pillars of solid pink colour. Two in front, two behind, 
they emerged from the imaginary corners on the top of her head and 
turned downward sharply. Just past her hips, all four broke apart into 
dozens of slender pink tendrils, like the tentacles of some bizarre 
squid creature, and even more disturbingly they seemed to be moving, 
constantly writhing and wafting, coiling around one another like a nest 
of vipers. Not a single end touched the ground on which she stood, all 
upraised around her thighs like a pack of dogs begging after their 
master.

Her eyes, though, were the worst. A vicious grin twisted her lips 
upward, displaying a row of stark white teeth all pristinely cleaned and 
straightened, and drawing attention up to her eyes. Those eyes, burning 
with a terrifying maniacal glee; they were the eyes of a girl gone 
utterly and irrevocably insane.

Shiho tossed back her head, her hands upraised towards the sky, eyes 
wide, and screeched out a demonic laugh.

&quot;Nowhere left to run now, Tokiha!&quot; Her eyes sparkled with insane joy.

&quot;What do you want, Shiho? Why are you after me?&quot;

&quot;Silence,&quot; Shiho shrieked. &quot;You know what you have done! You will pay 
for your crimes!&quot; A lightning flash of pink sent Mai sprawling across 
the dark, dirty alley floor with a yelp. The concrete cracked under the 
incredible force of the impact. Mai rolled until her shoulder hit the 
wall, crouched down low, her fingertips glowing with unnatural orange 
light.

&quot;Shiho, stop this! Please.&quot;

&quot;Die!&quot; The pink-haired girl dashed toward her, the writhing tentacles of 
her hair reaching forward like razor-tipped tentacles.

&quot;Mai!&quot; Cerulean shards peppered the ground in front of Shiho&#39;s feet, 
driving her back a step. Shiho turned her attention to the source of the 
interference and hissed savagely at the dark-haired woman aiming two 
large handguns in her direction.

&quot;Stay out of this,&quot; she spat. Natsuki answered with another burst of 
gunfire, sending the crazed girl hopping backwards.

&quot;Mai, get up! Just run! We can&#39;t afford to...&quot;

&quot;Die, bitch!&quot; Shiho leapt at her opponent again, reaching out with both 
hands and all twelve limbs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Fuck!&quot;

&quot;I warned you something like this would happen, but did you listen?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it! I&#39;ve had just about enough of that smug, 
superior attitude of yours! If you&#39;re so all-powerful and all-knowing, 
why couldn&#39;t you do something about this yourself?&quot;

&quot;There are rules to my job, idiot.&quot;

&quot;...fuck it. Okay, fine, whatever.&quot;

&quot;Look, what matters here is far more than just the girls themselves, or 
what they are.&quot;

&quot;Hah! You can say that, but if Prometheus&#39; advanced nanotechnology ever 
got the media&#39;s attention there&#39;d be serious trouble. You know what 
people like Lockheed or Beretta would do with that kind of stuff, not to 
mention if the FBI ever got their hands on-&quot;

&quot;-Shit, don&#39;t even joke about something like that. That&#39;d be pretty much 
World War Three, except...worse.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s already getting to be near enough impossible keeping attention 
away from the Child project in the States and in Europe and now NATO are 
poking their noses in over this disappearing fleet business and...what? 
What&#39;s funny?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not seeing the big picture.&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t really get much bigger than NATO having cybernetic 
enhancement technology, and that&#39;s assuming they don&#39;t figure out what 
the HiMEs really are.&quot;

&quot;Who made the wide-spectrum guidance systems for the JSDF&#39;s brand new 
anti-missile defence network? And who put the GTSD satellites in orbit? 
And who built the new marine carriers for NATO&#39;s Pacific Fleet?&quot;

&quot;...wait...you mean...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll give you three guesses, but you&#39;re only going to need one.&quot;

&quot;Shit! Okay, fucking...shit...damn it, whatever it takes, just get them 
back! I&#39;ll deal with Nagi in the mean time. And I suppose only the Prime 
Minister himself can do anything about BAE right now.&quot;

&quot;Good luck.&quot;

&quot;...you too.&quot;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Midsummer sun baked the city, but it might as well have been the dead of 
night in that tiny avenue, dark, cramped, cluttered and dirty. Wedged 
between two high-rise apartment buildings, all but identical in their 
utter lack of architectural appeal, dull greyish brown slabs of concrete 
several dozen storeys high. The walls became cliffs, a sheer vertical 
face on either side of a depressingly narrow and abysmally dark chasm, 
rough surfaces that rose up endlessly towards the distant sunlight. 
There were no windows, no view so desirable as to warrant such 
extravagance, so the canyon walls were bare rock laser-cut to an 
impossibly deep trench, sheer and unforgiving. High overhead, eternally 
far from the dank, cold dirt on the ground, streams of golden sunlight 
played through the crests of cloud-breaking buildings.

Down here, it was always midnight. The darkness was so thick that it 
swallowed everything, from the scratched and battered overflowing 
dumpster behind the restaurant, the ancient collection of abandoned 
mechanical spare parts left heaped up against the back wall of a bar 
like a pack of homeless dogs huddled loosely together, even the ground 
was nearly invisible through the gloom. At either end of the alleyway, 
sunlight streamed across, illuminating the streets outside, but never 
did it dare enter and pierce the profound darkness hanging cancerous 
within.

&quot;You&#39;re not the only one with orders.&quot; Midori thought her voice sounded 
much weaker than usual, muffled, swallowed up by the darkness instead of 
echoing around the narrow alley walls the way it should. She shifted her 
footing and mentally winced at the horrible feeling that brought as her 
feet moved through the...whatever it was covering the ground. &quot;You can&#39;t 
seriously expect to get away with something like this.&quot;

&quot;Ha!&quot; Shiho cackled, amused if nothing else. Her maniac grin had turned 
to an expression of leisurely amusement, still that unpredictable fire 
playing behind her eyes. &quot;Petty words are no threat to me, and neither 
are you.&quot;

A cracking noise brought Midori&#39;s focus sharply downward again. Her eyes 
flicked between the insane creature before her and the concrete ground 
below with well-practiced ease.

Shiho had merged the ribbon of compressed fabric around her left foot 
into the ground, sucking up the concrete surface itself like a vacuum. 
Tendrils of matter swirled and spiralled inward to form a rapidly 
condensing disk about a hand-span across, a deep crimson glow contained 
within like molten iron.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t be doing this.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do what I have to,&quot; Shiho snapped at the redhead, her own pink 
locks flicking irritably about her waist. &quot;Whatever it takes, I swore my 
life.&quot;

Midori ground her teeth together, trying her damnedest to bite back on 
all the scathing comments that sprang to mind. &quot;Let her go, damn it,&quot; 
she insisted. Her fingers brushed anxiously at empty air beside her 
right hip. &quot;You don&#39;t need her! I can find someone else for you...&quot;

&quot;Mai is mine now,&quot; hissed the pink haired girl as her dainty hands 
closed into fists so tight her knuckles turned white. Her hair began to 
boil, tendrils of her furious essence that coiled and writhed and 
squirmed their way upward until they hung in the air all about her head 
lending her an even more menacing appearance. &quot;She&#39;ll make a perfect 
bargaining piece, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

Midori replied only with a dismissive grunt. Shiho glared daggers at 
her. Fingers closed around nothing.

&quot;Then you die!&quot; Shiho let loose a wild screaming laugh as the disk of 
molten substance coagulating beside her foot split open and out poured a 
nest of wildly flailing yellow-orange tentacles, each thigh thick, each 
blazingly hot; molten concrete limbs rushing across the gap between the 
two women with frightening speed. Midori brought her right hand up 
across her body in a lightning arc, instantly severing a dozen of the 
attacking tendrils.

&quot;Let her go,&quot; she demanded once more, voice slow and deep. The sword 
materialised in her grasp with a blink, silver blade gleaming even in 
the dark alleyway.

Shiho stuttered. Her foot slipped back a step, the visage of insane rage 
faltered for but a moment. &quot;Interloper,&quot; she spat. Then she gathered her 
resolve, squared on to her adversary with a narrowed gaze. &quot;Does she 
really mean that much to you?&quot;

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have to answer that.&quot;

&quot;Yet I still have to ask,&quot; replied Shiho in a voice that was not her 
own. &quot;I was under the impression that the dragon was your only concern 
in this.&quot;

Midori ignored the question. &quot;Why must you twist the poor girl&#39;s mind 
like this?&quot; Her tone was still low and deadly serious; her opponent 
answered with an angry hiss.

&quot;She brings out your most territorial instincts,&quot; it commented almost 
offhandedly, glancing back to the red-haired body lying slumped up 
against the wall of the alley nearby.

&quot;Daughters do that,&quot; replied Midori in a carefully level voice.

&quot;Daughter?&quot; Shiho, who was not Shiho, laughed uproariously. &quot;You know as 
well as I do that you can never have that...pleasure.&quot; The words rolled 
from her tongue as if contemptuous, mocking. Midori gave half a smirk in 
reply.

&quot;You&#39;d be amazed what a little technology can do these days.&quot;

Again the strange voice on Shiho&#39;s lips spoke, this time a darker, 
softer tone, both wary and calculating. Her eyes fell upon Mai&#39;s prone 
body, still unconscious. &quot;So...an artificial birth...Kagutsuchi?&quot; She 
cocked her head slightly to one side, a look of bewilderment overcoming 
her features. &quot;A hybrid?&quot; Suddenly, it was fire in her eyes and in her 
face, hatred most malevolent. &quot;Intolerable.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s quite enough,&quot; growled Midori, sword streaking already. &quot;Back 
where you belong.&quot;

It felt rather like biting down on a sheet of foil with a mouthful of 
fillings, oddly enough. As usual, there was the sudden burst of static 
that shot up Midori&#39;s spine and made her hair stand on end like a giant 
puffball. The tip of the sword plunged effortlessly through the barrier 
surrounding Shiho&#39;s body and skewered the youngster neatly through the 
torso, in right between two ribs just left of her breastbone and out the 
back with not a trace of blood, bisecting her heart. The blade shone a 
brilliant blue for a moment, and Shiho let out an earth-shattering 
scream. Then a silent explosion of light turned the darkness of the 
alleyway into a barren white plain.

The flowing concrete at Shiho&#39;s feet froze into place, like some 
impromptu public art sculpture. The twirl of fabric wrapped around her 
body began to fray and soften, and her hair untied itself into a single 
vast pink mass. Midori felt the sword abruptly wink out of existence 
between her fingers and then watched the pink-haired girl crumple into a 
heap on the dirty ground with a muffled thump.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are all agreed, then. She has simply gone too far this time. This is 
way beyond her usual intimidation.

She has destroyed our only vessel, but she cannot possibly imagine that 
this will limit our overall influence on Earth. Identifying a 
replacement should pose little difficulty now.

Withdrawal is not an option at this stage, unfortunately. If we are to 
succeed in our infiltration, it is imperative that we apply ourselves 
totally to this endeavour, every one of us. This is no time for divided 
loyalties; humanity is still unaware of our presence here but that will 
not last long. These few have already begun to understand. We cannot 
allow them to stand in the way, now or ever. The more subversive options 
are being closed off one by one. Soon a covert infiltration will be all 
but impossible from our position here.

Yes, the child is a problem. One we had not anticipated. The possibility 
of this hybrid is dangerous not only to our plan but to all of us. The 
Collective should recognise that whether or not they agree with our 
methods.

Regardless, right now the most dangerous aspect of this entire operation 
is deployment. If the right pieces are not in their correct positions at 
exactly the right time, the consequences will be dire. A rupture is 
bound to occur if the boundary remains under this level of stress for 
any length of time. Even we should not entertain notions of such a 
catastrophic event.

We should concentrate on silencing her as our primary goal for now. If 
she cannot be eliminated physically, then she must be removed from the 
situation entirely. Force her into a corner. We now have a powerful 
bargaining tool; even if she were bluffing, she would never allow us to 
harm the child. Her mind is filled with her own delusions of 
self-righteousness.

This construct, this &quot;android,&quot; this should be our highest priority. 
This is the only weapon the humans have against us. We cannot allow its 
existence to continue.

We have been monitoring the humans&#39; progress with their &quot;Child&quot; project. 
This should serve our purpose well enough. It has already been decided 
which of us was to be chosen for this duty. Our entire operation will 
depend on you. Do not fail.

Commandeer the unit. Destroy the facility. Then...start killing. She 
will have no choice but to play her part exactly as planned.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was midnight somewhere in the vast wilderness of the Arizona desert. 
It was the time for life in the unforgiving wasteland to be up and 
active above the dry, dusty ground. The baking heat of the sun had long 
since leaked away into the cold, clear night sky. Out in the desert, 
there were no flocks of night birds to fill the air with their calls, 
only the occasional insects chirping here and there, a few small rodents 
dashing about the rocky faces of giant steep-walled mesas rising 
hundreds of feet into the air. In the dead of night, the desert was a 
sea of black, dotted here and there with clusters of broad rocky 
islands, flat shapes floating on an unmoving ocean reflecting slivers of 
moonlight that utterly lacked the softly undulating quality of such 
reflections on real water.

With such clear air and no light pollution from any nearby cities, the 
sky was empty of clouds on most nights. Normally invisible stars lit up 
the night; an immense black shroud adorned with billions of wildly 
scattered candles all shining from some impossible distance. The thick 
bright blur of the Milky Way was clearly visible stretching right across 
the sky from one horizon to the other. To the far north, low in the sky 
shone Polaris, a heavenly lighthouse suspended a million miles above the 
Earth.

From the outside, Prometheus looked like the eternally clich&#130;d old 
military base-come-research facility that science fiction was so fond 
of, with its utilitarian grey single-storey concrete buildings arranged 
in small clusters around the large main compound, surrounded by a ten 
foot high wall running around the perimeter. An abandoned runway 
stretched along the northern edge of the compound, the tarmac faded and 
cracked from age and neglect. The control tower had been dismantled long 
ago and only the steel framework skeleton of a modest hangar building 
remained. A helipad had been put in place much later in one corner of 
the main courtyard, a hundred feet from anything, nestled in against the 
rigid outer wall of the compound. The surface gleamed like polished 
obsidian in the moonlight, with the stylised P.R.L. logo sharply 
defined: Prometheus Research Laboratories, a formality upon which the 
CEO had been oddly insistent.

The seven rectangular buildings arrayed in a neat column wedged into one 
corner of the facility could have passed for a large barracks seen from 
the air. Corrugated metal freight doors, twenty-four-hour guards and the 
sheer bulk of pipes, cables and other assorted supply lines all siphoned 
into one end from the various separate processing areas of the compound 
might have seemed a little excessive, however. In truth, the main 
building was merely a fa&#135;ade, the tip of an enormous subterranean 
iceberg almost twice the size of the surface compound and far more 
densely packed with labs, offices, machinery and everything else the 
facility needed. The only things that were ever brought in from outside 
were the regular food deliveries, water from outside pipelines and from 
the experimental condenser tower, auxiliary energy from a nearby wind 
farm, and the occasional material or equipment samples from various 
international donators.

A hundred feet below the sand, sealed behind lead-reinforced concrete 
walls a metre thick, was hidden a miniature nuclear reactor. A 
ten-foot-wide cube with a dozen pipes and cables leading in and out, the 
top face covered in a pattern of circular holes into which slotted the 
control rods, set on a retractable panel that could be raised and 
lowered as required with ease even by hand. The cube gave a constant hum 
that resonated through the sturdy metal bracings securing it in place at 
one end of a long rectangular room the size of an aircraft hangar.

Between the reactor itself at one end and the single enormous reinforced 
door at the other, there was a broad metal catwalk suspended several 
feet above the floor. On either side at regular intervals were spaced 
three-metre tall glass cylinders filled with a viscous translucent green 
fluid, each one encircled by a thick metal belt just level with the 
catwalk itself, and covered in screens and panels and buttons and 
switches of all kinds. In all, there were twenty cylinders, ten on each 
side of the room arranged in a staggered formation. At the end of the 
room, with the reactor in the centre, a large space had been left 
between the tubes and the back wall, allowing for an immense bank of 
computer equipment to the left of the reactor complete with several 
bolted metal chairs and keyboard consoles. Opposite, protruding halfway 
out of the wall, was a single gigantic black sphere.

It was almost seven metres across, not that anyone besides the original 
construction team had ever seen it in full. Perfectly black, perfectly 
smooth, perfectly seamless. The only imperfection was a single oval 
window four feet across set into the side that allowed a view of the 
interior. Inside, a mysterious crimson substance glowed dimly with its 
own inner warmth, like a hot ball of iron.

The designer had called it the Creation Engine.

It had just gone midnight, and only two people were left inside the 
vault room. The usual system technician was busy tapping away commands 
into a console with incredible speed, filling one screen up with line 
after line of code while his eyes were busy with another. The huge panel 
screen up above was showing a three-dimensional representation of what 
might have been a nuclear fusion reaction system, or perhaps a very 
interesting screensaver. The other man was a theoretical particle 
physicist by nature, and couldn&#39;t really tell.

&quot;What&#39;s taking so long?&quot; The man in the lab coat looked at his watch 
again, for about the fifteenth time in an hour. &quot;It shouldn&#39;t take this 
much just to alter the transcription codes.&quot;

The technician gave him a humourless look. &quot;Do I tell you how to 
manipulate quantum probability?&quot; He turned back to the task at hand 
without waiting for an answer, not that one would come he knew. &quot;This 
equipment takes a lot of tweaking to get it right, and it&#39;s my job to 
make sure it&#39;s tweaked right. Or would you rather we let off a nuclear 
explosion in the middle of a crowded workplace?&quot;

&quot;Inside a chamber that&#39;s been explicitly designed to withstand twice the 
explosive force that reactor is capable of, not to mention the 
radiation.&quot; The physicist sighed again, and rifled his papers, again.

Click.

That wasn&#39;t the sound of a finger on a key. The man in the lab coat 
blinked. At first, he turned to look, to find out just where the odd 
sound had come from. It had certainly been loud enough to hear over the 
tapping of fingers, and sharp enough to be unusual. But then, somehow, a 
feeling of overwhelming urgency came over him, forcing him to stay put, 
as if turning round was probably the worst thing he would ever do. 
Instead, he cleared his throat.

&quot;Did you...&quot; He blinked again. It would sound stupid, but... &quot;Did 
you...hear something?&quot;

The technician looked up for a moment, opened his mouth to reply with 
something else derogatory. Before he could say anything, there was 
another click noise. His fingers froze in place at once, and his eyes 
widened.

&quot;That...that wasn&#39;t you, was it?&quot;

&quot;You heard it?&quot;

There was an agonisingly long moment of silence. Both men stood, or sat, 
respectively, almost frozen in place. They had both definitely heard 
something, quite what they could not say, but whatever it was 
certainly...felt bad. Then it happened.

The Engine spoke.

Deep within the microscopically modelled womb of the Creation Engine, a 
hundred billion machines no bigger than a single atom all sprang to life 
at once. The reddish fluid that made up most of the constituent soup was 
inert, but the high concentrations of hydrogen and helium gases 
suspended in the mixture made easy prey, disassembled into their 
components within seconds. Once the fluid had been reduced to a sea of 
sub-atomic particles, the red tint turned instantly opaque. Pressure 
rose at a phenomenal rate, setting off warnings and triggering alarms in 
the huge bank of computers.

Nothing the computer did could stop it. The paste itself was no longer 
under the control of the central processor; a spherical globule of 
nano-robots capable of replicating themselves into infinity, all now 
working towards some unknown goal with incalculable efficiency.

The Creation Engine gave an ear-splitting crack as its skin split neatly 
in two, rending a fissure a foot deep straight through the incredibly 
strong metal structure. Nano-robotic paste squirted from the crack at 
high pressure, spraying all over the walls like red rain, coalescing on 
the floor into a rapidly growing pool. The catwalk began to dissolve, 
along with the high-tensile ceramic shell of the Engine, and the 
computer consoles, and the glass tubes, and the surfaces of the reactor, 
and everything else the paste touched. More and more, consuming 
everything from the two bewildered humans to the very air inside the 
room, the machines replicated over and over a thousand-fold, a million, 
until there were enough to create what they had been ordered to create. 
And then, just as the huge semi-conscious network intelligence that the 
nanomachines had formed began to realise that there would never be 
enough sheer energy to perform such an incredible task...the reactor 
casing fractured.

The room contained the fifteen-kiloton blast just as it had been 
designed. It did not contain what came after.
