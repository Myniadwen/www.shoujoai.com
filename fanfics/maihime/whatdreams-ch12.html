<h1>What Dreams May Come (part 12 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leebot.html">Leebot</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/whatdreams-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a>Dreams of a Butterfly</p><hr><p><i>Natsuki…</i></p><p>Shizuru rested in the protective arms 
of her beloved. That night was the first time in her life she’d ever exposed herself so 
fully to anyone else, made herself so vulnerable. And Natsuki had loved the exposed Shizuru 
she’d seen and taken advantage of her vulnerability to bring her to heights of pleasure 
she’d never imagined being possible. Everything was right; it was the perfect moment, and 
she wanted it to last forever.</p><p>Sure, she could find doubts if she wanted to. How had 
Natsuki ever gotten so good at lovemaking? Did she have a secret history of lesbian 
lovemaking? No, of course not. She could worry about the real reason later. And what about 
Natsuki’s courage? How long could that last? Even last night, was Natsuki afraid of opening 
herself up to Shizuru?</p><p>Shizuru pushed all these doubts to the back of her mind. They 
didn’t matter, anyways. Besides, it might even be fun to play with an easily embarrassed 
Natsuki again. This night was good enough to keep her satisfied until she could work up 
Natsuki to that point again. A grin broke out on Shizuru’s face as she imagined Natsuki’s 
cheeks lighting up in a beautiful blush.</p><p><i>Ara, I really hope she’ll never get too 
courageous that I won’t be able to do that to her anymore… No, I won’t let that happen, 
however drastic I have to get with my teasing. As soon as I’m able to give her her own 
perfect first time like this, I won’t have to limit myself anymore. I could certainly have a 
lot of fun with her with no limits…</i></p><p>Shizuru forcibly stopped her mind from going 
down that road. There’d be plenty of time to fantasize about what she could do to Natsuki 
later, but the time she could spend just lying in Natsuki’s arms basking in the afterglow of 
her first time was limited. So with this goal, she let her mind drift back to the all the 
pleasure Natsuki had brought her. Her mind relived the events over and over, trying to 
relish every sensation she could recall, from the first kiss they’d shared that night to her 
climax and Natsuki gradually bringing her back to earth.</p><p>She’d really have to pay 
Natsuki back for this, she decided. It would take a lot of work to make it this good, but 
she would do everything she could. Natsuki deserved it, after all, even if it wasn’t for 
what she’d just done for Shizuru. <i>Ara, and to think that Natsuki actually gave me a 
coupon for this! I should really be giving her an extra for it, if anything. Hmm, maybe I 
really should, if all of her favors are going to be this good. Well, I’ll give her this one 
back at least, and focus the next favor on giving her an equally perfect night.</i></p><p>A 
ray of sunlight slipped into Shizuru’s vision, laying across Natsuki’s chest. As the minutes 
passed, it slowly worked its way up her body, eventually illuminating her angelic sleeping 
face for Shizuru’s eyes. Her position wasn’t quite the best to view it though, so with a 
little regret, she pulled herself up to get closer to it, trying not to disentangle herself 
from Natsuki’s arms.</p><p>Fortunately, Natsuki seemed to be trying to help her out here, 
even through her sleep. As Shizuru pulled up, Natsuki’s arms loosened slightly, before 
tightening back again as soon as she came to rest, her head on the pillow facing Natsuki’s. 
She spent many more minutes gazing at her love’s beautiful visage, relishing the fact that 
Natsuki was finally hers.</p><p>Eventually, her gaze drifted down to Natsuki’s cute lips, 
which seemed to just be dying for some attention. The urge passed through her to move in and 
give them a tender kiss, but she hesitated. They were a couple now, and it should be 
alright, but it still felt too similar to the time she’d stolen a kiss from Natsuki in her 
sleep. But still, she really wanted to get past her demons, and Natsuki surely wouldn’t 
mind…</p><p>“Natsuki?” Shizuru whispered hesitantly to her lover. “I want to kiss you. I 
don’t know if this will filter into your sleep, but I’d really like to have your permission. 
Please? May I?”</p><p>She really didn’t know what she’d been expecting in response. Natsuki 
couldn’t have given her much at any rate. Maybe a muttering in her sleep or something. But 
no response was forthcoming. Shizuru gave out a soft sigh. Even though she knew Natsuki 
wouldn’t mind at this point, she just couldn’t bring herself to do it. She just couldn’t 
risk letting herself take advantage of the girl again.</p><p>“<i>It’s alright, Shizuru. I 
give you my permission,”</i> <i>a small voice in Shizuru’s head said, sounding like Natsuki. 
Shizuru allowed herself to drift into a daydream to converse with this voice, and she found 
herself face-to-face once more with her Dream Natsuki.</i></p><p>“<i>Are you sure? But you 
can’t do anything to stop me. I’d be taking advantage of you,” she said to the image of 
Natsuki in her mind.</i></p><p>“<i>Baka,” Dream Natsuki teased. “Why would I ever want to 
stop you? I love your kisses. I love </i>you<i>, Shizuru. You don’t have to ask my 
permission to do something nice for me.”</i></p><p>Shizuru let out a light chuckle as she 
drifted down from her daydream. Her inner image of Natsuki was right; there was nothing to 
worry about anymore. It wasn’t a betrayal; it was just kissing her girlfriend and giving her 
a little happiness in her sleep. With this in mind, Shizuru moved her head forward and 
brought her lips to her lover’s, intent on giving her this bit of happiness.</p><p>Their 
lips met, and Shizuru started gently moving hers against Natsuki’s. Almost immediately, her 
partner’s lips started moving back in time with hers, reassuring Shizuru that Natsuki didn’t 
mind. She focused all of her mind on the feeling of Natsuki’s lips against hers, the sweet 
velvet bringing the message of love from the girl. The world around Shizuru seemed to fade, 
and nothing existed except for her lips and Natsuki’s.</p><p>A tongue tentatively slipped 
its way into Shizuru’s mouth, surprising the girl for a moment that Natsuki would get into a 
kiss in her sleep. Of course, she wasn’t going to protest, and she brought her own tongue in 
to play with it, delighting in the feel and taste of the soft organ in her mouth. This 
response actually elicited a soft chuckle from Natsuki, though it was mostly muffled by 
their kiss.</p><p>Had she woken her friend up? Shizuru opened her eyes to check on the girl, 
while trying not to forget to attend to the tongue in her mouth. Her eyes found the 
beautiful visage of Natsuki in front of her, her own eyes open and gazing adoringly at 
Shizuru. The two held eye contact for a minute, before Natsuki slowly withdrew her tongue 
and backed her head away from Shizuru, much to her displeasure.</p><p>Natsuki gave a 
mirthful grin at Shizuru’s pout. “I figured that would be the perfect way to wake you up,” 
she said as she allowed her head to drop back to the pillow.</p><p>The pout dropped from 
Shizuru’s face as the meaning of Natsuki’s words struck her. “Natsuki was kissing me in my 
sleep?” So had she been the one asleep then, instead of Natsuki? And that message from her 
Dream Natsuki, was that her mind telling her that Natsuki had started kissing her in her 
sleep, so it should be alright?</p><p>Unfortunately, dropping her pout and getting 
contemplative seemed to have given Natsuki the wrong idea about her emotional state. Her 
cheerful expression rapidly turned into concern and guilt, a blush rising on her face as she 
started to get flustered. “Oh no, Shizuru, I’m sorry. I really shouldn’t have done that 
without your permission! I don’t know what I was thinking. You were just so beautiful and I 
wanted to give you one more sweet experience to finish off the night before we had to get 
up, but now I’ve-”</p><p>Natsuki trailed off as Shizuru couldn’t hold herself back any 
longer and burst out into a fit of laughter. Her expression sunk into confusion and then 
embarrassment as she realized her faux pas. “Forgive me,” Shizuru said between giggles. 
“Natsuki is just too cute when she’s flustered.”</p><p>Natsuki’s face turned a deeper shade 
of red at this, and a repressed smile barely managed to form despite her efforts to look 
angry. “Baka!” she said as gave Shizuru’s shoulder a playful slap. “You really had me 
worried there.”</p><p>“Ara, don’t be worried, Natsuki,” Shizuru said as she was finally able 
to bring her laughter to a lull. “I’ll never be mad at you for kissing me, awake or 
asleep.”</p><p>A smile broke out on Natsuki’s face as she got her embarrassment under 
control, unfortunately also causing her blush to fade. “Thank you, Shizuru,” she said. “You 
can kiss me anytime I’m asleep, too, if you want. I know how much trouble you have resisting 
that.”</p><p><i>If only you knew, Natsuki…</i> To cover up her lecherous thoughts, Shizuru 
decided to see if she could get Natsuki’s blush to return. “Ara, Natsuki won’t let me kiss 
her anytime she’s awake as well?”</p><p>“Nope,” Natsuki said, parrying Shizuru’s tease and 
striking back with a riposte. “Because I know you’ll use it to embarrass me at every 
opportunity in public if I do.”</p><p>Shizuru was quick to go into full pout mode at this. 
“But Natsuki is so cute when she blushes, and I know she secretly likes it even though she’d 
never admit it. Doesn’t Natsuki want to be cute for her girlfriend to make her 
happy?”</p><p>The gratuitous use of “girlfriend” managed to make Natsuki blush again, though 
she wasn’t going to relent that easily. She gave out a sigh and dropped the pretenses of 
joking around. “I’m sorry, Shizuru, but I still don’t know how comfortable I am with other 
people knowing about us. I think I used up all my courage last night.”</p><p><i>Aw, I knew 
that had to be hard for you, despite your strong façade. </i>Shizuru leaned her head forward 
and gave Natsuki a quick kiss on the tip of her nose. “And I thank you for that, Natsuki. I 
can hold myself back when we’re in public if that’s what you need,”</p><p>“Thank you, 
Shizuru,” Natsuki said, relief evident on her face.</p><p>“Now, holding myself back in 
private is quite another matter…” Shizuru said, giving her voice a seductive tone and moving 
her face forward to Natsuki’s. She whispered the next few words to her lover, “I still have 
to pay you back for last night, if you remember.”</p><p>Natsuki’s eyes widened in surprise, 
and she instinctively pushed herself away from Shizuru. The reaction caused Shizuru’s mood 
to fade in an instant, and a pain struck her heart. There was no ulterior motive to the sad 
expression she gave Natsuki now. Natsuki’s expression immediately softened into regret as 
she saw the change in Shizuru, and she promptly leaned forward to grasp Shizuru into a 
hug.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Shizuru,” Natsuki whispered into her ear, her voice quivering. 
Shizuru could feel her body trembling in the hug, and she tentatively reached her own arms 
around to support the girl. “I want to let you, I really do, but I think I just used up all 
my courage last night. Just give me a little time, okay? Please don’t be upset, 
Shizuru…”</p><p>“It’s alright, Natsuki,” Shizuru said softly into her lover’s ear. The pain 
had fled her heart at Natsuki’s comforting reaction. All that mattered was making her feel 
better now. “I know how hard last night must have been for you. Besides, this way I have 
time to plan and make it just as special for you as that was for me. That sound good, 
Natsuki?”</p><p>The rising warmth against her cheek told Shizuru that Natsuki was blushing 
at this. “Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, Shizuru.” After a minute of resting in the hug, 
Natsuki pulled her head back and gave Shizuru a short but sweet kiss. “We really should be 
getting up pretty soon,” she said, regret evident in her voice. “It’s almost 10 
already.”</p><p>Shizuru gave a pout at this. “Only if Natsuki promises that we’ll be able to 
do this again very soon,” she said. “I’ve never slept so well before in my 
life.”</p><p>Natsuki gave a sigh at this. “I have summer school starting tomorrow; I don’t 
know if I can afford to risk being late. If I miss a single class, I’ll end up having to 
repeat a year…” Shizuru extended her pout and added a pitiful moan to it. Natsuki bowed her 
head in regret. “Friday. I can promise you Friday, we can sleep together again then, okay?” 
A blush filled her face at her words, realizing what she was in fact promising to 
Shizuru.</p><p>A grin split Shizuru’s face. Friday should give her plenty of time to think 
up the perfect plan, if she could manage to hold herself back that long. She moved her head 
forward to give Natsuki a quick kiss. “It’s a date,” she said.</p><p>A hint of a blush 
started to form on Natsuki’s face, but this was all Shizuru saw as the girl quickly turned 
her head away and sat up. The action denied Shizuru the delight of being able to see her 
blush, and she silently vowed to get back at Natsuki for that as soon as possible. As she 
pondered how she could do this, Natsuki pushed herself off of the bed and started picking 
out some clothes from her dresser and closet, momentarily distracting Shizuru with the her 
beautiful teddy-clad form. She rolled over onto her back and propped her head up on the 
pillow to better take in the view.</p><p>Natsuki turned back and blushed as she noticed 
Shizuru staring at her. Her arms twitched as if she were fighting the urge to cover herself 
up. She was able to resist, though, much to Shizuru’s delight. After a moment, Natsuki gave 
a roll of her eyes and said, “If you can bear to be without me, I’m going to go take a 
shower a now. You can use it when I’m done.”</p><p>“Ara, and if I can’t bear to be without 
you, can I use it before you’re done?” Shizuru teased. Natsuki’s face immediately lit up red 
at this. Her success at making the girl blush this morning came as quite a relief to 
Shizuru. Although confident Natsuki certainly had her perks, she didn’t know if she’d be 
able to live without the easily-blushing version.</p><p>Natsuki was quick to recover, 
though, and she forcibly suppressed her blush. “Not this morning,” she said. There was a 
very slight quiver to her voice as if she was holding back a little nervousness. “No sneak 
peaks until this Friday. You’ll just have to wait.” As she finished this sentence, Natsuki’s 
face returned to its previous blush as her spurt of courage faded. She rapidly turned to 
head to the door.</p><p>“Natsuki, wait,” Shizuru said, and the girl stopped halfway through 
the door. “Say it.”</p><p>Natsuki slowly turned back to Shizuru. The blush had started to 
fade from her face, but enough of it remained for it to be quite cute nevertheless. “Say 
what?” she asked.</p><p>“You know.” Shizuru gave Natsuki her best cute grin with a little 
sparkle in her eye to make sure she got the hint.</p><p>Natsuki didn’t disappoint her, and a 
loving smile formed on her face. “I love you, Shizuru,” she said, causing a wave of warmth 
to run its way through Shizuru’s chest. The words also seemed to make any hint of fear fade 
from Natsuki. Shizuru noted this fact for future reference.</p><p>“I love you too, Natsuki.” 
Her words seemed to have a similar effect on Natsuki, as the girl’s face immediately lit up. 
She made no attempt to hide her delight as she backed off through the doorway, giving 
Shizuru a wave as she left her line of sight.</p><p>Shizuru allowed herself a few more 
minutes to doze and bask in what remained of the afterglow of her encounter with Natsuki. 
Her mind drifted to thinking about what their next encounter would be like. Five days had 
never seemed like such a long time before. Maybe she’d be able to get Natsuki to do a little 
something for her in the meantime, and then pay her back double when her turn finally 
came.</p><p>And then there was the other matter of properly paying her back for denying 
Shizuru the blush she’d rightfully earned. No, the other blushes she’d invoked wouldn’t do 
it. Natsuki had to be taught a special lesson so she’d never deny Shizuru such a pleasure 
again… or at least she’d only do it when she wanted to pay the price, which Shizuru would of 
course assume was the case if it ever happened again.</p><p>As she heard the shower stop, an 
idea struck Shizuru and she jumped into action. Natsuki had said Shizuru could use the 
shower after she was done. What she hadn’t specified was that Shizuru had to wait until she 
was fully dressed to get in. Of course, it wouldn’t be quite so embarrassing for Natsuki if 
Shizuru entered in an equal state of undress, but if she spent the time to get dressed, 
she’d miss her opportunity.</p><p>Shizuru scrambled around Natsuki’s room, trying to quickly 
find where she kept her spare towels. Her closet was a bust, but Shizuru was eventually able 
to find them in a lower drawer of her dresser. She took one out and wrapped it around 
herself, and she then proceeded to the door to Natsuki’s bathroom.</p><p>Now, although 
Natsuki hadn’t explicitly denied her entrance at this point, she had requested no peaking 
until it was finally her night. It was with this in mind that Shizuru decided to give her a 
bit of leeway and a chance to cover herself up. The door to the bathroom had transparent 
panels, so if Natsuki were in any position to see through she’d get a bit of warning, but 
Shizuru could still see through and catch a glimpse if she wasn’t careful.</p><p>With a 
sigh, Shizuru let her eyes close to make sure she wouldn’t see anything. <i>I hope you 
appreciate everything I do for you, Natsuki, even when I have to punish you.</i> Using one 
hand to keep the towel secure, Shizuru reached out with her other hand to where she 
remembered the handle was and stepped in front of the door. As she pulled it open and 
stepped through, she allowed a grin to spread on her face at the surprised shriek it 
elicited from Natsuki and the sounds of her friend scrambling to cover herself 
up.</p><p>Figuring that if Natsuki hadn’t concealed herself sufficiently by this point, it 
would be her own fault, Shizuru allowed her eyes to drift open as she smiled at the 
flustered Natsuki, who currently had her arms crossed in front of her breasts and had 
fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately) already put her panties on. Her face held a panicked 
expression, which started to redden as Shizuru eyed what she could of her 
body.</p><p>“Shi-Shizuru!” Natsuki said, her voice breaking. “What are you 
doing?”</p><p>“Ara, Natsuki said I could use the shower when she was done. She didn’t say 
anything about waiting for her to finish dressing.” Shizuru batted her eyelashes at Natsuki 
as she said this, and gave her best devious smile. She continued on her path to the shower, 
and when she had her back to the girl, she allowed the towel to drop from her body, hoping 
Natsuki would take advantage of the view. “But maybe if Natsuki wishes me to be a bit more 
considerate, she should show some consideration to me and not try to hide her blushes, 
especially if she’s going to make me work so hard for them.”</p><p>Natsuki was silent as 
Shizuru entered the shower and pulled the curtains, though she was likely in the midst of 
quite a blush. Shizuru wished she could turn back, but she had to be strong and keep up her 
façade, lest she weaken the impact of her punishment. As she reached for the handle to start 
the water, she heard Natsuki give a sigh and a defeated, “Shizuru…”</p><p><i>Mission 
successful.</i></p><hr><p>As Shizuru entered her house, she headed straight to the bedroom 
to drop off her dirty clothes in the laundry hamper. It hadn’t been hard to convince Natsuki 
to loan her a set of clothes for the drive over, just a little gentle teasing about how it 
was her fault, after all, that Shizuru had spent the night, and did she prefer Shizuru to 
have to take another shower when she got back so she could picture it in her head?</p><p>It 
wasn’t even too hard to wear most of Natsuki’s clothes – their frames were quite similar. 
The only tough part was the bra, and Shizuru had been forced to choose between suffocating 
herself with one of Natsuki’s bras or doing without. In the end, she’d chosen to make do 
with one of Natsuki’s bras, as the thought of her going without threatened to send Natsuki 
into a seizure.</p><p>It was with relief then that she finally took it off, allowing herself 
to take in a deep breath as her chest regained its freedom of movement. She removed the rest 
of Natsuki’s clothes and put on an outfit of her own, leaving Natsuki’s outfit in the duffel 
Natsuki had loaned her to bring back her own outfit. After checking herself out in the 
mirror and straightening her hair, she headed to the kitchen to brew herself a cup of 
tea.</p><p>When she had a kettle of water heating up, Shizuru allowed herself to take a seat 
at the table as she waited. As her mind played back the events of the past night, it 
eventually flashed on the pleasant sight of Haruka and Yukino together as a couple. Shizuru 
allowed herself a smile of pride, knowing how she’d helped push them together. At this 
thought, she got up from the table and proceeded to a nearby cabinet, where she’d taken to 
keeping some of her personal papers.</p><p>There wasn’t much inside the cabinet quite yet, 
so it was easy to find the checklist she’d made almost a week ago to track her path towards 
redemption. She’d already checked off “Forgiveness” for Yukino and Nao, and she now 
proceeded to check of “Reparations” for Yukino and Haruka. Fixing the two of them up 
certainly counted as a sufficiently large favor.</p><p>This left only two boxes: Forgiveness 
for Haruka, and Reparations for Nao. Shizuru let out a sigh at the thought of these last 
tasks. It seemed like it would be impossible for her to have a serious conversation with 
Haruka about these issues anytime soon, so getting forgiveness would be quite difficult. 
Maybe eventually that would be possible, but it would have to take quite a few developments 
in their relationship.</p><p><i>Well, I guess that’s something to work for then. I really do 
owe it to Suzushiro-san to get to know her better. Perhaps I should try inviting her over 
for tea sometime. Shouldn’t hope for too much at first; simply having her come and have the 
roof remain on the house would be enough of a success. Well, there’s something I can do this 
upcoming week while Natsuki’s at school.</i></p><p>The case of making reparations for 
hurting Nao was quite a different matter. In that case, Nao had specifically asked that 
Shizuru <i>not</i> try to do anything for her. It didn’t seem right to simply count off not 
doing something as meeting her criteria, but Nao wouldn’t appreciate it if she did do 
anything.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Shizuru gave a sigh used her pen to black 
out that particular checkbox. Sticking close to her plan wasn’t the important part, it was 
making the others feel comfortable around her again and being able to forgive herself. She’d 
certainly gotten the former done in Nao’s case, and she was finally approaching the latter 
as well.</p><p>She still regretted what she’d done, and she knew that she always would, but 
it was time to put it behind her and move forward. She had new friendships to work on, 
including some with the very people she’d hurt in the Carnival. Even more importantly, she 
had a new relationship to focus on as well, and Natsuki wasn’t going to tolerate any moping 
from her.</p><p>On the thought of her relationship, Shizuru’s eyes caught the stack of 
letters she’d been writing for Natsuki. She’d been planning to give them to the girl as soon 
as she was sure she could accept her feelings, and that time had certainly come to pass. Her 
only regret was that she would still have to hold herself back from ravaging Natsuki as 
she’d planned when writing the first letter, but she’d be sure to make up for it as soon as 
she had a chance.</p><p>Shizuru took the pile of letters out of the cabinet and started 
leafing through them. When she reached the bottom, she was reminded of the letter she’d 
written the previous night and left in her purse. She left to retrieve it, and noticed on 
her way back that the kettle of water was just about ready. She removed it from the stove 
and took out some tea leaves from her cabinet to start brewing.</p><p>When her tea was 
finished, Shizuru sat down to read through all her letters once more as she sipped her cup. 
Natsuki was sure to get quite the blush on her face from reading all of this, and if she 
were lucky, maybe it would even restore her courage enough that Shizuru wouldn’t have to 
spend the next week in patient agony waiting for Natsuki to be ready.</p><p><i>But could I 
still make it special enough for Natsuki?</i> Shizuru wondered. <i>She did so much to make 
my first night one to remember, it seems wrong not to do the same for her. Then again, 
making love right after she reads these letters does seem quite romantic. But if I give them 
to her today, and she doesn’t give in, my plan will be ruined. I guess I’ll have to hold off 
on these until Friday, when she’s promised me to be ready. Can’t take any chances 
here.</i></p><p>Her choice made, Shizuru resolved herself to having to wait. She’d waited 
this long for Natsuki to be ready, she could easily wait another five days. But before that 
time, there was one last letter she had to write. Her emotional journey chronicled in the 
letters wouldn’t be complete until she included the last night and this morning. Taking out 
a pen and paper from the nearby cabinet, Shizuru set down to writing.</p><hr><p><i>I love 
you, Natsuki. I know I got into a bit of a habit of starting off these letters with “Ara, 
Natsuki,” but I just couldn’t bring myself to start off with anything else this time. It 
just wouldn’t be right. After everything that happened last night, no other thought has been 
going through my mind more. I love you. See? There it goes again. There is one other thought 
that’s fighting for dominance, though: that you love me as well, and were finally able to 
admit it.</i></p><p><i>I’m so proud of you, Natsuki. To be honest, I never expected you to 
be able to admit your feelings this soon, if you ever could. I thought it would take months, 
maybe years, of working on you to slowly pry them out. But you were stronger than I gave you 
credit for. Once you’d set your mind to it, you figured everything out in less than a week. 
I’ll have to remember to ask you sometime what made you set your mind to it in the first 
place.</i></p><p><i>But that’s not the only thing I’m proud of you for. I’m also really 
proud of the way you were able to overcome all your fears and insecurities last night for my 
sake. I never expected that you’d have it in you. I know you’ve shown amazing courage in the 
heat of battle, but emotionally, it’s always seemed to be a lot harder for you. But for my 
sake, you were somehow able to work up the courage to do all of that. You can be quite 
sweet, you know?</i></p><p><i>It’s alright, though, that your courage had faded this morning 
(though thankfully not before you could give me that sweet wakeup kiss). I still really love 
the shy and nervous Natsuki, especially when I can make her blush. You have no idea how 
adorable you are when you do that. Sexy too, I guess I can admit that now, since you figured 
it out yourself with me last night. I wonder, when your turn comes around, will it be the 
shy Natsuki or the courageous Natsuki I get to make love to? I have to say, I kind of hope 
it’s the shy one. There’s something about seducing my way past your barriers and feeling you 
give in to me that really gets me going.</i></p><p><i>One thing has been kind of worrying 
me, though, Natsuki. How did you ever manage to get so good? You couldn’t have had any past 
experience with this sort of thing. Personally, I’ve fantasized more than is probably 
healthy about being with you, and if I were to distill all my fantasies down, I might be 
able to come up with something quite good for you (which by the way, I plan to), but I can’t 
imagine you having fantasized about me like that. Maybe in the last few days since you 
figured out your feelings, though it still doesn’t seem much like you. At the time, I 
thought it was simply your love for me guiding your motions. I guess, failing any other 
explanation, I’ll just stick with that one. It’s quite a nice reason after 
all.</i></p><p><i>Well, that’s about it for these letters. After this, I’m going to make an 
effort not to hide anything from you. I do kind of like the experience of getting all my 
thoughts out like this, so maybe I’ll get a journal or something. Don’t worry, I’ll make 
sure you know where it is so you can peek in whenever you want.</i></p><p><i>By the way, I 
know I promised you in a couple of these earlier letters that I’d start doing things to you 
as you read them. I decided to hold myself back though, as you’ve surely figured out by now. 
I wanted to let you get through all of these in relative peace. I’m probably hugging you or 
something while you read them, though, maybe with a few tender kisses here and there. Ooh, 
and here. Definitely there as well. Oh, in case you haven’t figured it out yet, your very 
special night is about to begin. 
Enjoy!</i></p><p><i>Yours,</i></p><p><i>Shizuru</i></p><hr><p>As Shizuru was about to change 
into her robe and settle in to bed for the night, her gaze was caught by a flash of white on 
the floor of her room. Near Natsuki’s duffle bag, she found a stuffed envelope. Her name was 
written on it in Natsuki’s handwriting. The girl had likely slipped it in when she’d gotten 
it for Shizuru, and it had fallen out when Shizuru had removed her clothes.</p><p>Shizuru 
peeled open the envelope and found a handwritten letter from Natsuki inside. She turned on 
her bedside lamp, laid back, and started to read.</p><hr><p><i>Hey there, Shizuru. Sorry if 
this sounds like I’m rambling, but I sat at my desk for a while trying to get things started 
perfectly, and got precisely nowhere. I tried organizing everything in my head and then 
writing it down, but that ended up sounding like crap so I’m trying a different tactic. So 
this time, I decided to just let everything flow out of me as it came. It might be rough, 
but at least this way it’ll get written.</i></p><p><i>Anyways, the letter you sent me gave 
me an idea. I decided to write my own letter to you to let you know all the thoughts that 
have been going through my head at this time. I feel real bad about keeping you in the dark 
like this, but I really do have trouble thinking straight when you’re around, and I need to 
be sure of my decision on this. I do want to tell you all this eventually, so I’ve decided 
to write all this down while it’s still fresh in my mind.</i></p><p><i>Okay, first things 
first. I suppose I should start as far back as I’ve been keeping stuff from you, and that 
starts back at the end of the Carnival. I spent a lot of time contemplating my feelings for 
you after the revelation of how you felt for me, but it wasn’t a time that was particularly 
good for clear thought. Even despite your betrayal of me, I knew that I still cared deeply 
for you as a friend. Eventually, I came to the resolution that I still did love 
you.</i></p><p><i>Only briefly then did I try to figure out what type of love I had for you. 
I’m sorry to say that I was still so repulsed by what you’d done that I immediately rejected 
any possibility that it was romantic love I felt. I decided that I loved you very much as a 
friend, and as your friend, it was my responsibility to save you from the demon you’d 
become.</i></p><p><i>Well, you pretty much know how things went in our battle. You thought 
then that I hated you a lot, seeing Duran’s size, but to me it told me that I was right in 
my conclusion that I still did care for you. (I’m thinking now that I may have actually been 
wrong there, and should have taken the hint that it meant my love for you was beyond simple 
friendship, but I’m still trying to figure that part out, so bear with me.)</i></p><p><i>It 
got to the point where you had me beaten and restrained, but you of course couldn’t do me 
in. I didn’t really have a specific plan for getting to that point, but I knew that at some 
point in the battle I’d have to get close to you and set you straight. I knew it was now or 
never; I had to prove to you that I still loved you. It was the only way to stop the monster 
that was raging inside you.</i></p><p><i>In the end, it was mostly instinct that made me 
choose to kiss you. The thought struck my mind that it would work, and I didn’t second-guess 
it. So, I did it, and you know everything I told you after that. I still thought at the time 
that I couldn’t love you as you loved me, and so I told you that. It was then I made the 
hardest decision I’d ever made in my life, when I ordered Duran to destroy Kiyohime and 
himself.</i></p><p><i>I didn’t want to do that, I really didn’t. I wanted to live on with 
you, finally accepting you as my best friend. But I couldn’t do that. Beyond our emotional 
struggle, the Carnival was still going on, and if it weren’t brought down to a single HiME, 
the HiME star would hit Earth… or something. End of the world, is the point. Neither of us 
could win, as either of us being defeated would spell the death of the other. If the two of 
us were alive together at the end, it would all be over, and we’d die anyway. We had to die 
so that Mai could be the last one standing and bring things to an end.</i></p><p><i>But 
that’s all beside the point, really. Sorry, I warned you I’d probably get rambly (is that a 
word?). Okay, back on topic. Once everyone was back alive again and we weren’t dealing with 
the immediate aftermath of the Carnival, my thoughts started to drift back to how I felt 
about you. After seeing the change I’d brought about in you by simply accepting your 
feelings, I was able to forgive you for taking advantage of me and kissing me in my sleep. 
And with that forgiveness went the repulsion I’d felt at possibly loving you 
romantically.</i></p><p><i>So I finally had to actually face my feelings and figure out what 
I really felt. The problem was that I sucked at it. I’d had enough trouble admitting to 
myself that I loved you at all, trying to differentiate between types of love was completely 
beyond me. I tried to sort things out while you were around me, but you’re just so damn 
distracting. It seems like you couldn’t go five minutes without embarrassing me in some 
way.</i></p><p><i>Then I tried to do it when you weren’t around, but the constant specter of 
you suddenly hugging me from nowhere started haunting my mind. The fact that you actually 
did this on a number of occasions while I was trying to figure things out certainly didn’t 
help matters. Even when I was locked up in my dorm, I still couldn’t properly concentrate. 
I’d get thinking about things, and before I knew it I was missing the fact that you hadn’t 
already caught me in a hug.</i></p><p>…<i>Fuck. You’re going to hold that last part over my 
head for the rest of my life now, aren’t you? Damn it. I really don’t want to start this 
letter over. I probably should have written this in pencil or something. I know if I just 
cross it out, it’ll make you even more desperate to read it and you’ll just make things 
worse. Okay, how about this: You don’t hold this over my head, and I’ll try not to complain 
about your hugs. Deal?</i></p><p><i>Anyways, perhaps my constant thoughts about you were a 
sign I should have paid more attention to, but either way, I didn’t think of that at the 
time. Eventually I just decided I needed a vacation from everything. Well, you know how that 
plan turned out, so I ended up having to ask you to give me some time alone. You also know 
how </i>that <i>plan turned out: with me almost immediately getting a flu which required you 
to come nurse me.</i></p><p><i>To be honest, though, I was really happy to see you. I’d 
tried to talk things through with Mai earlier, but she didn’t end up being much help. Her 
case with Tate was just too different, so I couldn’t garner any clues from her about how I 
was supposed to identify love. All she said was that I should try to figure out if I was a 
lesbian or not, and work from there. I considered that for a bit, but I’d just buried my 
libido too far down to figure anything out that way. The only way I’d be able to get it out 
would be if you were the one to pry it out of me, but to get to that point, I’d have to 
answer the question which was the whole point of figuring that thing out.</i></p><p><i>Bleh. 
So, those thoughts rolling through my head, I drifted off to sleep. When I woke up, you were 
watching over me. In a rare moment of weakness, I’d caught you with your mask off, and I 
could see the love bared in your eyes. It really struck a chord in my heart to see you like 
that, and I realized that I preferred it to when you covered up your emotions. Not only did 
I prefer that you didn’t hide yourself from me, but it made me feel good to know you loved 
me. I kind of even wanted to be able to make you feel the same way.</i></p><p><i>Well, you 
know pretty much how that day went, and what we ended up doing after the unpleasantness with 
the negi (which, by the way, might make me fear the vegetable a bit less knowing what it 
indirectly led to. But do </i><i><u>not</u></i><i> take that as an invitation to use it in 
anything other than cooking when it comes to me). What you don’t really know about that is 
the thoughts that were going through my head as I kissed you.</i></p><p><i>Now, my stated 
reasons for doing so were true. I wanted to figure out how it felt, to see if it felt good 
(which it did), and if it would cause those weird physical sensations in me which seemed to 
come with interacting with you (which it also did). But there was another reason for doing 
it. When I made the decision, you were crying in my arms, and I really wanted to make you 
feel better and take the pain away. I took my own fear of intimacy with you and shoved it 
behind the reasoning of using this to figure things out so I could take away your pain. I’m 
glad to say that I think I did, though I really wish I hadn’t shoved you away like that, 
risk of infection or not.</i></p><p><i>Well anyways, I really did enjoy that kiss, Shizuru. 
It’s an experience I don’t think I’ll ever be forgetting. I took a very good catalog of all 
the sensations I felt during it, the problem is, I just don’t know if they add up to love. 
I’ve decided what I’m going to do next, though. I’m going to ask you about your feelings and 
try to compare. If everything matches up, then I’m going to go for it with you. To be 
honest, I really hope it does. I hope I can learn to love you so I’ll never see that pain in 
your eyes again.</i></p><p><i>--</i></p><p><i>I love you, Shizuru. It feels so good to 
finally be able to admit that. I admitted it to myself earlier tonight right after you told 
me about your feelings. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you then, but I knew what would happen if I 
did. There’d be no way you’d be able to hold yourself back (I might have some trouble 
myself, to be honest), and you’d be pretty much guaranteed to end up with my flu. I know you 
probably don’t care about that, but I do. I really don’t want to hurt you, Shizuru. I’d 
really hate to think that my profession of love ended up hurting you like this. I hope you 
can understand.</i></p><p><i>I decided then that when I finally told you, I’d do everything 
I could to make it the best night of your life. I know how long you’ve been waiting for 
this, and I want it to be perfect when it finally happens for you. I’m still not sure 
exactly what I’m going to do, but I’ve got some time to think over it.</i></p><p><i>One idea 
that just won’t get out of my head though actually comes from something you said to me. You 
teased me earlier about using one of my coupons to be allowed to ravish your body, and I 
wasn’t as embarrassed by the thought as I would have thought I’d be. Now that I know I’m in 
love with you, it seems right. I think I want you, Shizuru, all of you. Not only that, but, 
erm… pleasuring you like that seems like a good way to make your night all the 
better.</i></p><p><i>Of course, the obvious problem with that plan is that I’m probably not 
going to be so good at it my first time. I’m probably going to be pretty nervous and 
hesitant, and I’m afraid that could take away from the experience. I wish I could be a lot 
better for you. I know you wouldn’t mind in the slightest however good I was, as long as I 
tried, but I really want to make this special for you, Shizuru. You deserve so much pleasure 
after being in pain for this long.</i></p><p><i>I guess, maybe I could try some research or 
something on it. They have everything on the internet, maybe I could do some searching. And 
maybe I could try a few things on myself, see how my own body reacts. It’s just, I’ve never 
done anything like that before, and I’m nervous just about doing it on my own. As I said 
earlier, my libido has been pretty buried. Now that it’s starting to show up, I kind of want 
my first real experience to be with you, so I’ll have to be careful not to go too far with 
myself.</i></p><p><i>Ugh. I bet you wish you could see my face right now. I think I’ve just 
invented a new shade of purple. It won’t be any good if I start to blush like crazy when the 
time finally comes (though I know how much you love that, so maybe one or two for you). I’ll 
have to find the courage somewhere to go through with it. For your sake, Shizuru, I know I 
can do this.</i></p><p><i>--</i></p><p><i>Yes! I told you I could find the courage for this. 
It was amazing. I started focusing on this. Giving you the perfect night was my new mission 
in life, and all the courage I used when I was fighting as a HiME came out to help me here. 
I know I can do this now, and I know I can be good at it too. Yes, I succeeded in doing some 
research on it, and I think I have some very good ideas of what I can do. I even 
experimented on myself a little, and it seems to work. Don’t worry, though, I managed to 
hold back enough to save myself for you when that time comes.</i></p><p><i>That did make me 
think though; I know you’re going to want to return the favor to me, and I’m still not sure 
how I feel about that. I really want this to be your night, Shizuru. I don’t want you to 
feel obligated to do anything for me. However, if your perspective on this is anything like 
mine, you’d probably really enjoy the giving part as well. I guess, maybe I could let you do 
that. I’m just afraid my courage won’t hold up that long. I know I can hold it long enough 
to handle your needs, but I don’t know how long it will last. I guess maybe we’ll just have 
to wait and see. </i></p><p><i>--</i></p><p><i>Wow… Looking back, I have a little trouble 
believing I actually did all that. And I can’t believe it all went so well. Hell, it even 
went better than I predicted. It was a stroke of luck finding about the sensitivity of where 
your HiME mark was, and another stroke of luck stumbling onto that spot. Most of my other 
moves were planned out, but even when I improvised with that, everything went 
perfectly.</i></p><p><i>You know, in a way, I kind of regret in retrospect a few things I 
didn’t do. I wish I’d spent more time simply exploring your body and figuring it out. Sure, 
the things I did worked, but I’m going to have to get to know you a lot better beyond the 
obvious sensitive spots for future encounters to be even better. Oh boy, I hope you don’t 
walk into the room right now and see this blush, because then you’d make me explain it, and… 
gah!</i></p><p><i>Heh, I probably should try to finish this up soon. I still need to figure 
out a way to give it to you today. No reason to hold all this back from you anymore. Okay, 
just one more thing I need to say: I’m really,</i><i><u>really</u></i><i> sorry about the 
fear I showed this morning when you wanted to return the favor. I knew my courage would have 
run out sooner or later, but why did it have to be right then?</i></p><p><i>I really want to 
be with you, Shizuru, but I can’t deny that I’m still a little afraid. We somehow settled on 
a date for it, though, and there’s no way I’m backing out now. No matter how afraid I might 
be then, Shizuru, don’t let me chicken out from it. Shove this letter in my face if you have 
to. I know I’ll end up giving in and enjoying it in the end, so don’t worry. Friday, I’ll be 
yours. Just… please be gentle, okay?</i></p><p><i>With love (and I’m sure you know what 
type),</i></p><p><i>Natsuki</i></p><hr><p>Darkness surrounded Shizuru. There wasn’t really 
any scenery to speak of, but somehow, this was familiar. This was where she’d battled it out 
with her darker side in her dreams a week ago. She remembered the events clearly. She’d 
poured her heart out into the battle, and she’d nearly lost. It was only by the timely 
rescue of her Dream Natsuki that she was saved.</p><p>Of course, the darkness in her heart 
would never vanish entirely. She’d have to deal with it the rest of her life. Perhaps this 
was why she was back here again: for another battle. It really seemed an odd time for it. 
She’d finally been able to forgive herself for what she’d done. Then again, maybe that was 
it. Maybe she just had to seal the deal.</p><p>“Oh, stop being such a downer, Shizuru,” 
Natsuki’s voice came from behind her, and Shizuru rapidly turned around to look at her. A 
blush quickly formed on Shizuru’s face as she realized that Natsuki was only clad in the 
teddy she’d worn the previous night. She was just as alluring as she’d been then, and it was 
all Shizuru could do to keep herself from pouncing on the girl.</p><p>“What’s going on, 
Natsuki?” Shizuru asked, trying to focus on the meaning of her dream rather than her 
scantily-clad lover.</p><p>“What’s going on is that you’re still hung up about fighting with 
yourself,” the girl said. The glare she gave Shizuru was quite at odds with her current 
outfit, and Shizuru had to fight down a sudden urge to giggle. “Your dark side is a part of 
you, like it or not. If you keep fighting with it, you’ll end up destroying yourself. While 
you’ve been off enjoying yourself with the real Natsuki, I’ve been in here trying to make 
peace with her.”</p><p>“Ara? And what has Dream Natsuki been doing with her?” Shizuru asked, 
hoping her tone could tease a blush out of the girl. Sadly, she had no such 
luck.</p><p>“Well…” Natsuki said, a smirk on her face as she wagged her eyebrows at Shizuru. 
“You know that she’s born from your love for me, right? Well, after seeing what the real 
Natsuki did to you, let’s just say inspiration struck.”</p><p>A warmth rushed through 
Shizuru’s chest and a blush rose to her face as she realized what Natsuki was talking about. 
She then felt an odd sensation as if something were filling her up which had been long 
missing. She was no longer cut off from a part of her personality, but it was no longer a 
part to be feared. As long as she had Natsuki, she had nothing to fear.</p><p>“I figured you 
might find that part of you useful for when you get around to taking care of me,” Natsuki 
said to her, a loving smile spreading across her face.</p><p>Shizuru matched the smile with 
one of her own. “Thank you,” she said. “There’s just one thing I was thinking of…” Natsuki 
rolled her eyes. By this point, she knew what was coming, but Shizuru said it anyways. “I 
could really use some practice for Natsuki’s big night…”</p><p>Natsuki gave out a sigh and 
shook her head. “You never give up, do you? Sorry, but this is something you’ll only be able 
to learn in reality. Dreaming just isn’t going to help you learn about this one.” Shizuru’s 
face turned into a pout. Even though it was only mock hurt, Natsuki did seem to react to it, 
pained seeing even a pretense of pain from Shizuru. “Alright, I’ll tell you what. I can let 
you relive your experience from last night as much as you want. Deal?”</p><p>Shizuru didn’t 
even have a chance to reply as she found herself back in her room, Natsuki slowly kissing 
her way down her body. She gave a contented sigh and laid back to enjoy her dreams.</p>
