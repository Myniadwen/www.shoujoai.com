<pre>Yukino Kikukawa&#39;s Private Journal
Day One

After much deliberation and conversation with Haruka,
I&#39;ve decided to accept the role of the head of the
Executive team. With Haruka graduating to Fuka
university the position will be coming open, and she
wants me to take it. Knowing that someone I respect so
much thinks I can do this helps a great deal, and in
truth I have difficulty denying her anything. Tho
sadly Haruka has not taken advantage of that fact.

Day Three

Just finished a rather disturbing conversation with
the former council president, Fujino. I didn&#39;t want
to see her... I still remember the implacable coldness
in her eyes when she destroyed Diana, the horror at
Haruka&#39;s disappearance. She contacted me by phone
yesterday, claiming it was urgent, and after much
talking she convinced me of her sincerity. 

We met up at the university, borrowing the tea club
rooms, where Shizuru formally served us both before
speaking. It seems that the former Obsidian Prince,
Reito Kanzaki, will be running for president and is
likely a shoo-in to win. Shizuru urged me to accept
the Executive position in order to keep an eye on
Reito, to make sure there is no relapse to his
previous behaviors. We feel reasonably confident that
the Obsidian Prince was destroyed after the
destruction of the Hime Star, but she pointed out that
the Obsidian Prince had in the past possessed Reito
without any visible sign. 

It was the next part of our talk that chilled my
bones, however. Calmly drinking her tea Shizuru had
explained that if Reito was the Obsidian Prince once
more, I could count on her assistance to deal with
him. She didn&#39;t say it explicitly but I suspect she
would deal with Reito in a very lethal manner. 

I wonder if Natsuki knows what sort of tiger she has
by the tail?

The only highlight of the day was taking a moment to
visit Haruka. She seems happy at university, though
she&#39;s already back to competing with Fujino. Still,
I&#39;m glad that Haruka has someone she knows here, even
if I do wish she was still in high school with me.
Haruka fiercely hugged me when I confirmed with her
that I was planning to run the executive, and I could
almost feel my heart skip a beat with the pleasure of
it. I didn&#39;t let her see how I felt of course, but I
must confess to squeezing her a bit long, too.

Day Seven

The first meeting of the temporary student council,
pre election. Reito remains both charming and
enigmatic, a smooth but difficult to read figure. The
remainder of the council are all new to me, including
a blonde young lady taking my old job as secretary.
While a bit disorganized to start, we got the meeting
going and read through Fumi&#39;s greeting letter. Very
inspiring. We&#39;ll be meeting weekly from now on, it
seems.

Day Ten

One of the things I&#39;ve become aware of is how many of
the members of the Executive are graduating with
Haruka. Over a third of the members are going, and I&#39;m
unsure how many will stay on with Haruka leaving. On
the plus side I&#39;ve gotten assurances from several
members I&#39;ve worked with that they&#39;ll follow me.

After some debate I intend to set up a booth on club
day, manned by myself and a few others to bring in
members. In the past we&#39;ve relied on Haruka&#39;s personal
magnetism to pull people in, but I&#39;d rather attempt a
more standard method. Wish me luck, I may need it.

Day Twelve

The question of recruiting the former Hime came up
while I was talking to Reito today. He confirmed, in
his charming way, that he was running for President
and asked about my supporting him, as well as my plans
for the executive. He jokingly suggested I create a
&quot;Hime Soldier&quot; core for the executive, tasked with
defending the campus from evil.

Wonder if we could get surplus costumes for the
group? And would Midori insist on our learning action
team poses?

After assuring him of my support I left, but the idea
nudged at me gently. Obviously certain Hime were out
of consideration. Fumi and Midori are both adults,
though one could argue about how adult Midori really
is. Also, however much I may respect Natsuki Kuga, the
idea of such a rebel like her in the Executive gives
me chills. For similar reasons I wouldn&#39;t want someone
like Nao Yuuki in the executive, too. Still, it&#39;s
something to consider.

Day Twenty

Miyu Greer has begun working at the Linden Baum
diner. It&#39;s a remarkably surreal experience, being
served by the former killer android who&#39;s fought both
against and for us. I wonder if Alyssa Searrs actually
needs the money Miyu will be making, or if Miyu is
doing it for her own reasons?

Day Twenty three

I&#39;m still uncertain about admitting a gossip like
Chie Harada into the executive, but I must confess she
would be an invaluable source of information. Aoi
Senou, on the other hand, has been a remarkable morale
booster since the club recruitment day fiasco. We are
gradually gaining members, which is a comfort as
student council requests for executive assistance have
begun to come in. 

As I expected Miyu, Natsuki, Akira and Nao have all
turned down requests to join the Executive. I&#39;m of
mixed feelings about that, thought both Natsuki and
Miyu have promised to offer temporary assistance if
anything unusual does come up. On a more pleasant note
Mai Tokhia and Mikoto Minagi have both agreed to join,
with Mai finding special amusement in the whole
situation. Understandable, considering her sun ins
with Haruka previously.

Day Twenty four

Note: Have a long talk with Mikoto over when not to
use her wooden practice sword on student council
business. May need Mai&#39;s help in explaining it, too.

Day Twenty seven

My meeting with Fumi Himeno was an enlightening
experience. On first talking with her you get the
impression that she&#39;s sweet, good natured and hasn&#39;t a
original thought in her pretty little head, but
clearly that isn&#39;t the case. According to records I&#39;ve
accessed Fuka is doing much better under Fumi&#39;s reign
than Mashiro&#39;s. Admittedly this is partially due to no
more Hime disasters, but it also owes much to Fumi&#39;s
managerial skills.

Fumi has also made it clear that she&#39;s well aware of
my fears regarding Reito. However, she seems much more
confident than I that the Obsidian Price is DEAD, but
also understands our concerns. She not-so-subtly
encouraged me to keep an eye on him, just in case.

On another note, I really need to thank Chie for the
report she gave me on Fumi. I have no idea where she
got that level of information, but she was incredibly
in depth. I doubt I could have done as well even using
my Element and Diana. 

Day Thirty

Met with the new secretary of the Student Council
earlier today. Erstin Ho is a surprisingly pleasant
girl, and approaches the job with much energy and
enthusiasm. Amusingly, one of the main things this
blonde haired girl is noted for is the size of her
breasts, which nearly rival Mai&#39;s generous set. 

She&#39;s quite new to student politics, and I&#39;ve found
myself taking Erstin under my wing, so to speak. When
I mentioned this to Haruka in one of our regular phone
conversations she warned me not to get too distracted
in helping Erstin, and I jokingly reminded her that I
was just following in her footsteps.

Day Thirty three

Student council elections officially took place.
Reito beat Alyssa SEarrs for president handily,
putting him in power with Alyssa becoming his
vice-president. Erstin as Secretary and I head of
Executive round out the core of the group, with
representatives of the other grades assisting as well.

Day Forty

I&#39;m finally beginning to understand more why Haruka
would lose her temper while dealing with Reito. It&#39;s
really quite frustrating to have spent hours
researching a problem, sorting data then present it
only to receive a &quot;Now now&quot; from Reito.

Erstin looked quite concerned, I assume she was
worried I was going to follow in Haruka&#39;s footsteps
and blow my top, but I managed to keep my composure.
In fact he seemed very pleased with my reaction, so
much so that I suspect he was trying to provoke me to
see what I would do.

Remind me to do something unpleasant to him later.

Reito&#39;s primary skill as the council president is in
diplomacy, in my opinion. He&#39;s very good at helping
fighting parties find some common ground to end their
conflict, and often saving the faces of both
combatants at the same time. Yet he&#39;s also quite
decisive, making good snap decisions when needed.

Day Forty three

Midori has showed up, working once again at the
Linden Baum to Mai and the other&#39;s shock. Last we
heard we was off living the daring archeological
lifestyle but Mai promises to try to find out what&#39;s
going on. I&#39;m also putting Chie on the case, so either
way I should know more about Midori soon.

Erstin asked me out to lunch to discuss student
council business, so maybe we&#39;ll go there. I find I
like talking to Erstin even away from the job, and I
think she&#39;s getting used to talking with a senpai such
as myself. She&#39;s quite smart and not too athletic, and
at times I almost feel like I&#39;m talking to a younger
version of myself. Unlike me, however, she&#39;s much more
outgoing and seems unaware of her circle of admirers.

Day Forty eight

It seems that Shiho Munakata and Yuuichi Tate have
officially become involved, despite how close Mai and
Yuuichi had become at the end of the Festival. Mai
seems to be deeply hurt, though she&#39;s trying her best
to hide it and carry on at work or in class. I wish
there was something I could do, but it&#39;s out of my
hands. Mikoto came to me for advise and I suggested
she just continue to be near to Mai and help where she
can. 

In a remarkable show of restraint Chie sat on the
rumors about Mai&#39;s distress, and she and Aoi have even
squelched a few of the nastier stories. As I told
Erstin earlier, my opinion of Chie has actually gone
up a bit.

Day Fifty

Mai has reluctantly pulled out from the executive. I
gave her my blessing, as I can understand nursing a
broken heart, work and school would be difficult. She
has also assured me if anything apocalyptic happens,
she&#39;ll help out.

I hope the &#145;apocalyptic&#39; comment was a joke.

Day Fifty six

Midori&#39;s &#145;Mai cheer up&#39; kareoke party went pretty
well, I think. I&#39;m still more than a bit hung over, so
my impressions aren&#39;t all that clear, but I do recall
Mai and Mikoto cuddling a lot. Wonder if that means
what I think it means?

On another note I was glad they all accepted Erstin
coming along with us. With Chie and Aoi there I would
have felt bad leaving Erstin out, and apparently she
and Mai do know each other somewhat. Erstin has a
remarkably pretty singing voice, and she blushed very
cutely in the costume Midori insisted she wear.

Day sixty

Reito was very public about comforting Mai, tho I
suspect he&#39;s doing it more to jab at Yuuichi than
anything else. He seems to respect Mikoto&#39;s interest
in Mai like a good big brother, and it looks like his
one public display with Mai was to imply that she
dumped Yuuichi for Reito rather than being dumped.
Chie promised to help spread rumors to that effect
too.

Day Sixty two

I&#39;m going to kill Chie. Lingeringly.

Day Sixty three

All right, I&#39;ve calmed down. Chie has confessed that
yes, she was the one who spread the rumor about Erstin
romantic interest in her friend, Miss Nina Wang.
Apparently Erstin drunkenly confessed during the
kareoke party and Chie, giving in to a old habit, put
the rumor out without thinking about it. Erstin was
devastated, as you can imagine. Nina was apparently
unaware of Erstin&#39;s interest and has since snubbed the
girl, adding to her pain. Erstin is trying to keep a
stiff upper lip in classes, but I suspect it&#39;s wearing
on her. 

I feel so much sympathy for her it hurts, to be
honest. It could so easily have been me in Erstin&#39;s
shoes, snubbed by the one I love because of some
foolish words. I&#39;m offering her all the emotional
support I can, and I&#39;ve also suggested to the
Executive that if they see any harassment of Erstin to
step on the offenders hard.

Chie is doing everything she can to squelch the
story, which may be the only thing that saves her from
Aoi&#39;s wrath. Before this I wasn&#39;t aware of the kind of
influence Aoi has over her, but tough, outgoing Chie
seems to wither when Aoi&#39;s truly annoyed.

To be continued....

Notes: I think Reito actually graduated with Haruka
and Shizuru, but I&#39;m fudging that for the sake of the
story. :) Also, some of the content is based on
information from the &#145;Director&#39;s cut&#39; of episode
twenty six.
