<h1>Masquerade (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/arcajeth.html">Arca Jeth</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Special Thanks: Since this part contains so many story threads, I want 
to thank my beta readers, Cuddlyness, JstLurkin, and Mireiyu from the 
Shoujo-Ai Forum. ::HUGS:: ^_^

[Author&#39;s Note]This story is the epilogue to my angst-filled story, 
&quot;Loose Threads.&quot; it occurs a few months after part 13 and is a much 
happier story. (No double suicides this time ^_^) therefore, it is 
SPOILER-FILLED. you have been warned. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Himeno Fumi, former maid and current director of Fuuka Gakuen welcomed 
them at the door. Her customary business suit, worn during school hours, 
was replaced with a black gothic maid&#39;s uniform. Its high- necked blouse 
and starched, white apron (with plenty of lace frills) spoke of 
yesteryear. Her pastel pink hair was hidden under a short, black wig. 

&quot;Welcome to the director&#39;s Residence,&quot; she said cheerfully as students 
streamed in. The guests were dressed in all manner of costume from the 
mundane to the outlandish. 

The Director&#39;s Costume Ball was a new event at the school, but Fumi 
hoped it would become a valued tradition. 

Through the door sauntered the leggy, blonde Corsican assassin, Mireille 
Bouquet. Perfectly coiffed, blonde hair sleeveless top and snug 
mini-skirt guaranteed that would-be enemies were lulled by her beauty. 
Until, that is they found themselves at the end of her gun. 

&quot;Bon soir&eacute;e, Mademoiselle Fumi,&quot; she greeted in oddly accented French. 
She gracefully passed as her high-heeled boots clicked smartly upon the 
tiled foyer. 

&quot;MAI!&quot; 

Her oh-so-cool entrance was foiled by the arrival of her pint-sized 
partner-in-crime; the suddenly very talkative, Yuumura Kirika.

Decked out in a white hoody, over a denim vest (also with mini-skirt) 
and pink tennis shoes, the mop-headed killing machine was flying this 
way and that, trying to spot familiar faces under the masks.

The Corsican bombshell (a.k.a Tokiha Mai) smiled apologetically to 
Fumi-san as she tried to rein her roommate in. The two made for the 
sounds of music and laughter inside.

The next guest was quite a surprise to Fumi-san. 

&quot;Haruka,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;So good to see you, er...ALL of you.&quot;

For Haruka had indeed arrived. That is Tenoh Haruka; seven of them to be 
exact. 

&quot;Is she here yet? Where is she? She said she was coming. TELL ME WHERE 
SHE IS!&quot;

&quot;Um...pardon,&quot; Fumi ventured, her trademark poise was starting to crack 
by now. &quot;Whom are you looking for?&quot;

All seven Sailor Uranus&#39;s gave an exasperated sigh. 

&quot;Who else? Yukino-ONEE-SAMA!&quot; they replied with such giddiness Fumi 
could almost see their intimate fantasies dancing in their heads.

The Kikukawa Yukino (ONEE-SAMA)Fan Club had arrived.

The director made a mental note for aspirin, lots of aspirin.

&quot;She hasn&#39;t arrived yet, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; she said.

The fan club was rather famous (or infamous) for being rabid Yukino 
otaku. Even going as far as getting eyeglass prescriptions to match the 
student council president (whether they needed them or not).

&quot;Why are you all..?&quot; Fumi indicated their identical costumes.

&quot;That&#39;s simple,&quot; said Ayame (apparently the group&#39;s leader since she had 
the most swoon in her voice when she said &quot;Yukino-ONEE-SAMA!) She 
whipped out a PDA seemingly from nowhere. &quot;According to Kaori-chan&#39;s 
surveillance Onee-sama said she wanted to be a Sailor Senshi for the 
party. Ayu-chan found out that Onee-sama wanted to go to the party with 
Haruka.&quot;

&quot;I hid in a trashcan for three hours for that tidbit,&quot; Ayu (apparently) 
boasted.

&quot;So obviously she came as Kaioh Michiru a.k.a. Sailor Neptune,&quot; Ayame 
concluded loftily. 

&quot;I can&#39;t wait for her to arrive,&quot; Ayu gushed. &quot;I&#39;m her favorite, you 
know.&quot;

&quot;Just because Yukino Onee-sama spoke to you once in the washroom doesn&#39;t 
make you her favorite!&quot; Kaori interjected before adding to Fumi: &quot;She 
asked her for a paper towel.&quot;

&quot;It was fate!&quot; Ayu insisted. &quot;Our eyes met, and in that moment I knew 
Onee-sama was my destiny! It was a paper towel of love.&quot;

The eventual melee was cut short by the arrival of the desperately 
anticipated senshi.

&quot;USAGI?!&quot;

...and her date...

&quot;MAMORU?!&quot; 

****

Away from the chaos of the entrance, Harada Chie and Senou Aoi were 
working the crowd for loose rumors, dressed as Lillian Jogakuen&#39;s Satou 
Sei and Toudou Shimako respectively. 

The juiciest tidbit of the night was the appearance of the golden-voiced 
wunderkind of Fuuka, Alyssa Searrs. In a new, mature body. The official 
story was she had a genetic disorder which stunted her growth. 
Apparently the disorder had been cured over the summer.

While Chie found this explanation highly suspect, everyone was being 
annoyingly tight-lipped on the subject. 

&quot;That scowl doesn&#39;t fit you.&quot; Aoi chided her.

&quot;I do so hate losing,&quot; Chie groused. 

&quot;Then shall I let you win later on?&quot; Aoi grinned lasciviously. 

&quot;When did you ever &#39;let&#39; me win? I&#39;ve always gained victory by pure 
talent.&quot; 

Aoi only smiled knowingly as she kissed her lover&#39;s cheek.

&quot;Keep that up and a Sister will punish us,&quot; Chie whispered, for she was 
clad in the dark-green, modestly cut sailor fuku of Lillian Jogakuen. &quot;I 
wish Fuuka was a garden of maidens.&quot; 

&quot;I think you&#39;d enjoy that far too much,&quot; a similarly dressed Aoi 
replied. &quot;Why do I get the feeling you&#39;d start your own harem then?&quot; 

Her companion&#39;s reply was cut short when the house lights dimmed and a 
spotlight appeared on the stage. 

&quot;And now, ladies and gentlemen,&quot; a disembodied voice announced. &quot;For the 
first time on stage, Fuuka Gakuen&#39;s own, Alyssa Searrs and 
Loli-Connexion!&quot;

The was a general gasp from the audience as holographic flames erupted 
to reveal five group members pounding out a blistering speed metal riff: 

Minagi Mikoto, still in her Kirika outfit, was a whirlwind on the drums. 
Yuuki Nao, dressed in the white jacket and skirt of St. Spica Girl&#39;s 
Institute, mercilessly thrashed lead guitar. Munakata Shiho strummed 
along on rhythm guitar, resplendent in a coral pink kimono and plenty of 
hair ribbons. And on bass Class 2&#39;s diminutive diva, Oota Yayoi, dressed 
in a white athletic shirt and bloomers, pounded out a killer line.

Before them all, wearing a black tres jolie ensemble, with elaborate 
white lace accents along the knee-length skirt stood the lead vocalist 
of Loli-Connexion. While not very tall, the new Alyssa Searrs&#39; teenage 
body was a vision of trim figure and scant curves. Her platinum-blonde 
hair cascaded down her back, held with a black lace ribbon. 

Her flashing blue eyes sparkled with a mirth she knew not even in her 
extended childhood. Pumping her satin-gloved fist to the punishing beat 
Fuuka&#39;s &quot;Golden Angel&quot; sang. It wasn&#39;t the soft, youthful lisp her fans 
remembered, but a banshee&#39;s wail whose power pressed the audience 
backward.

Punishing yet always melodic, Alyssa&#39;s singing pushed Loli-Connexion 
forward with its power. Backstage, Alyssa&#39;s android companion M.I.Y.U. 
beamed as laser lights and pyrotechnics blazed from her gunarm.

The costumed audience gathered into a writhing, dancing mob as the group 
belted out its signature tune &quot;My Electronic Lover.&quot; As the set ended, 
the members drifted off stage to find refreshment, Alyssa was met by an 
odd couple.

Akane (dressed in a navy school blazer, white blouse with red tie, above 
a green checked skirt) along with Kazuya (in a black gaku-ran over a 
white dress shirt) joined Alyssa and her companions at the drink table. 

&quot;You guys rocked!&quot; Kazuya exclaimed his arm about Akane&#39;s waist. &quot;Do you 
have an album out?&quot;

&quot;Actually, Miyu was recording the performance,&quot; Alyssa smiled up at the 
android. 

&quot;Retail CDs will be ready by the end of the evening Oujo-sama,&quot; she 
announced with a peculiar gleam in her eye. &quot;Would you like to retire 
for the evening?&quot;

&quot;Do you two ever get enough?&quot; Yuuki Nao cut in as she tossed a water 
bottle to the diminutive diva. &quot;I hope that new body of yours came with 
a warranty.&quot;

&quot;I never hear you complaining about it Yuuki Nao,&quot; Miyu smiled sweetly. 

&quot;Umm...you all stay together?&quot; Akane ventured. &quot;Isn&#39;t it cramped in that 
church basement?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not like we need a lot of room,&quot; Alyssa took the drink gratefully. 
&quot;There&#39;s Miyu&#39;s maintenance equipment, some closet space, toiletries and 
of course the bed.

&quot;THE bed?&quot; Kazu leaned forward with interest.

&quot;Arima-kun,&quot; Akane tugged rather forcefully at his arm. &quot;Let&#39;s go 
dance.&quot;

&quot;But, Miyazawa-san,&quot; Kazu noticed the sharp look in her eyes. &quot;Um...so 
take care.&quot;

&quot;Is he ever whipped,&quot; Nao commented as the young man was dragged away. 

&quot;I think I&#39;m ready to go,&quot; Alyssa smiled at both girl and android. &quot;Feel 
like accompanying me?&quot;

&quot;As if!&quot; Nao sniffed.

&quot;Suit yourself. Come along Miyu,&quot; Alyssa led her companion away. I want 
to test that oscillation upgrade you were telling me about.&quot;

Nao stood there a moment, her mouth hanging agape. With the pain of her 
recent past behind her Nao thought it would be difficult to be with 
anyone again. But with these two she&#39;d found something...interesting.

&quot;In for a penny,&quot; she said with a shamefaced grin. Nao quickly followed 
her roommates.

------------------

Mikoto was busy gathering snacks from the refreshment table. Or rather 
the other guests were trying to secure some food before the little 
firebrand grabbed it. 

Behind her, sitting at a table, Tokiha Mai followed the girl with her 
eyes. She smiled absently thinking of everything that had brought her to 
this point. To think that a twist of fate could have ripped Mikoto from 
her arms forever. 

However, she dwelled not upon these things. There was just too much to 
be thankful for now. That beautiful girl&#39;s love was one such thing.

Mikoto busily argued with a caterer over a rack of lamb, while Mai 
watched her from behind. The small girl had abandoned her white hoody 
exposing her cute bottom. Mai was guiltily glad she had insisted her 
roommate wear a miniskirt tonight.

&quot;Enjoying the view?&quot; The blonde Corsican spun, red-faced, to face the 
French aristocracy. 

Her Majesty Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna von Habsburg-Lothringen, 
Archduchess of Austria and Queen of France. Or just Marie Antoinette for 
short. 

Resplendent in gown of white and silver with beaded underskirt and 
overskirt, white chemise, and lace choker, the queen held a white- 
feathered fan which she used to hide a most embarrassed flush from her 
powdered face and green eyes.

For the comment had come from her companion Oscar Fran&ccedil;ois de Jarjayes. 
In the blue topcoat, epaulettes, white breeches and riding boots of her 
uniform, the Captain of the Garde Imp&eacute;riale positively shimmered with 
satisfaction. With a sword at her side she seemed prepared to do battle 
with anyone who threatened her queen.

&quot;Uhhh...Natsuki?&quot; A red-faced Mai finally managed. &quot;I didn&#146;t see you 
come in.&quot;

&quot;We decided to make a low-key entrance,&quot; Fujino Shizuru&#39;s smile 
broadened. 

&quot;I still don&#39;t see why I couldn&#39;t be Oscar,&quot; Kuga Natsuki fumed as she 
shifted her corset. A tremendously high wig of blonde curls sat 
precariously upon her head and spilled down her back.

&quot;Because you lost the bet Natsuki,&quot; her companion reminded her. &quot;Or 
would you rather pay the penalty?&quot;

&quot;So, wow, this is some party,&quot; Mai changed the subject as Natsuki&#39;s face 
turned crimson. &quot;I hear it&#39;s going to be an annual affair.&quot;

&quot;Everyone needs a chance to live out certain fantasies,&quot; the former 
student council leader nodded toward Mikoto. &quot;Every now and then.&quot;

The feral girl was returning laden with treats, an angelic smile on her 
face. As there eyes met, Mikoto&#39;s smile faltered a moment, but did not 
disappear. She greeted Natsuki and Shizuru warmly, yet her gaze never 
strayed long from the woman she loved most. 

The two couples chatted a while longer, Mai&#39;s arm thrown casually about 
Mikoto&#39;s waist. It was a few moments passed before she realized her hand 
lingered near her companion&#39;s backside. 

&quot;Shall we dance, Your Highness?&quot; Shizuru asked bowing elegantly over 
Natsuki&#39;s hand. 

&quot;How forward of you!&quot; The queen feigned genteel outrage. &quot;You assume far 
too much Captain of the Guard. I thought you&#39;d never ask.&quot;

She was led away, her escort wondering aloud if the costume shop would 
let them keep the feathered fan.

Suddenly alone with Mikoto, Mai guiltily pulled her hand away. But, her 
small companion would have nothing of it. She brazenly threw her arms 
about Mai&#39;s neck and gazed into her amethyst eyes. 

As she gazed at this girl who loved her so mightily, Mai felt something 
inside begin to give. Feeling their bodies so close, separated by only a 
few flimsy layers of fabric would soon be her undoing. 

&quot;Mikoto, the food,&quot; she tried feebly. 

&quot;I&#39;m not hungry.&quot;

The last shreds of her resolve slipping away, Mai leaned in towards 
those luscious, cherry lips...only to be stopped by a tap on her 
shoulder.

&quot;Keep it PG, Mai-chan&quot; Harada Chie quipped. &quot;You two are starting to 
affect the Yukino fan club.&quot;

She nodded towards an awkward looking group of bespectacled girls all 
dressed as Sailor Uranus. All were looking on while chewing their 
handkerchiefs. 

&quot;Let&#39;s go Mai,&quot; Mikoto offered helpfully. 

&quot;You don&#39;t want to stay for the party?&quot; Mai queried. 

&quot;There&#39;s nothing here that I want.&quot; Mikoto answered with a quick kiss. 

Mai could only smile as she was led away. What would the rest of this 
night bring? 

-----------------

The aforementioned Yukino Fan Club was in its own quandary at the 
moment. Their beloved ONEE-SAMA, had been swept off her feet by a 
Mysterious Masked Interloper (or MMI as Ayame had dubbed him). A schism 
had formed in the club&#39;s ranks birthing two factions: The group who 
resolved to celebrate the president&#39;s new-found love, and the group who 
would tolerate the MMI until they found some kind of dark secret about 
him or at the very least got him to stand under a pot of boiling oil. 

&quot;We can&#39;t just off him!&quot; Ayu exclaimed. &quot;I thought we wanted Yukino 
onee-sama&#39;s happiness above all else.

&quot;Of course that&#39;s what I want,&quot; Ayame shot back. &quot;I just want her 
happiness to be with ME! We wouldn&#39;t even be in this mess if SOMEONE 
hadn&#39;t heard ONEE-SAMA wrong!&quot;

&quot;How dare you?&quot; Ayu countered. Her voice becoming even more shrill (if 
that was humanly possible). &quot;I know what I heard! Yukino onee-sama 
wanted to go to the party with Haruka. She was saying that to Oota-san 
in the dressing room after gym.&quot; 

&quot;The DRESSING ROOM?!&quot; Ayame exploded. &quot;You mean...you saw...her....&quot;

Ayu nodded reverently. &quot;It was a spiritual experience. Pink...&quot;

&quot;Hey, wait a minute,&quot; Kaori interjected before all the girls fainted. 
&quot;Where are they?&quot; Caught up in their (rather vivid) fantasies, none of 
them had noticed their beloved onee-sama disappear.

&quot;They&#39;re ALONE?!&quot; Ayame&#39;s back went rigid. &quot;That cad could do anything. 
He might do this, or that. Or even THAT! Yukino ONEE-SAMA fan club, 
ACTION!&quot;

As the hyperactive fan-girls spread out across the mansion, they managed 
to miss a secluded terrace, separated from the party by curtains and 
French doors. 

Ignoring the view of a lighted Fuuka Gakuen Chiba Mamoru and Tsukino 
Usagi danced the night away. 

&quot;Are you happy Usagi?&quot; The masked hero asked. 

&quot;Yes very,&quot; Kikukawa Yukino answered, leaning her head on her 
companion&#39;s shoulder. &quot;But you don&#39;t have to stay in character. No one 
can see us here.

&quot;It&#39;s called methodical acting,&quot; Suzushiro Haruka as she lifted Yukino&#39;s 
chin to see her eyes. 

&quot;Method,&quot; she corrected softly, going in for a sweet kiss. &quot;I missed 
you.&quot; 

&quot;And I you,&quot; Haruka basked in her presence. Even though her ankles 
smarted from the lifts in her shoes, she could endure if only for those 
lips.

&quot;By the way,&quot; Yukino said. &quot;Why did you want to visit me like this? I 
don&#39;t care if people know about us.&quot;

&quot;And I don&#39;t care if no one knows I&#39;m here,&quot; Haruka answered beneath the 
dark wig and top hat. &quot;I just wanted you to myself tonight. This night 
is about your fantasy&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Yukino murmured as she leaned against Haruka&#39;s breast...or at 
least where it was supposed to be.

&quot;How did you hide them?&quot;

&quot;A friend of mine at Tokyo University showed me how,&quot; Haruka said 
adjusting the binding. &quot;She writes these trashy romance novels, which is 
strange because she&#39;s also some kind of kendo master.

&quot;Though I can&#39;t wait to get out of this,&quot; she sighed. &quot;&#39;Truth&#39; and 
&#39;Justice&#39; here are suffocating.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you could come back to my room then?&quot; Yukino offered with a shy 
smile. &quot;I could help refresh you.&quot;

&quot;Yukino,&quot; Haruka chided. &quot;Dorm regulations prohibit overnight guests-&quot;

She was cut off by Yukino&#39;s lips upon her own.

&quot;Haruka-chan,&quot; Yukino said when they parted. &quot;Forget the rules.&quot;

Rendered speechless for once, Haruka gallantly took Yukino&#39;s arm and 
retired to the Fuuka Gakuen dormitory. 

---------------------------

Fin.

Thanks to everyone for your reviews, comments and just for reading. It 
think it&#39;s harder for me to write something happy than to put characters 
through the seven levels of Hell. Though I am glad to dig myself out of 
the Angst Pit for once. The next part is...well, you&#39;ll find out. ^_-
