<a href="../maihime/kisaki-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>Huntsman

An ear piercing screech came from the forests that bordered Kyoto, and 
all of the Ikusahime instantly knew what it was. It was louder and more 
ferocious than anything an Orphan could have produced. This was from 
something much stronger and much more dangerous. It was a Child leaving 
the realm of mortals. The farewell howl penetrated deep into the 
underground HiME fortress, and all those within quickly fell silent and 
snapped to attention.

In the first second, every one of them looked to their side, trying to 
find the missing face. Sister. In the following second, they took off at 
a sprint, racing towards the outside. In a few moments they had cleared 
the outer defense perimeter and set foot onto partially frozen soil. The 
depth of winter still had a death hold on the countryside. Eyes scanning 
through snow laden and leafless trees, they found what they did not want 
to see. A plume of green mist rose from the forest far below before it 
was taken by the wind. The Ikusahime with softer wills put their hands 
over their mouths as they tried to stifle a horrified shout, but failed 
to do so.

For the Ikusahime born with wills of iron, a much different reaction was 
had. Action must be taken! As the multiple, but united, voices of 
Kiyohime roared, one the bravest of the HiME dashed forward to meet the 
beast and its Mistress head on. Nao was the first, sprinting forward 
with uninhibited fury. Shizuru had no right! That coward had signed her 
own death warrant the moment she refused to put Alyssa out of her 
centuries long misery! If Shizuru wanted to play the game, then so be 
it. This time, Nao had no intention of losing the Carnival, especially 
to that same depraved witch.

&quot;Nao, wait!&quot; Mai pleaded. She took flight and followed after the other 
redhead, hoping to stop her from doing anything rash. Midori and Akira 
were next. Then Akane. Soon, the whole group was in motion.

Nao and Mai were the first to arrive on the scene, a lifeless looking 
Yukariko lying prone on the ground. The giant form of Kiyohime reared 
up, Shizuru perched on the central head. The monster Child roared, the 
multiple voices nearly shattering their eardrums once again. Incredibly 
tall while on its haunches, the dragon forced Mai to duck down low to 
avoid any potential attacks. As Nao and Mai readied themselves for any 
form of assault, Kiyohime and its Mistress turned and continued to flee 
the scene.

&quot;Juli--!&quot;

A hand roughly grabbed hold of Nao&#39;s shoulder and spun her around. It 
was Mai, who now displayed more leadership and seriousness than she had 
even shown as a Meister. &quot;Don&#39;t you dare start a Child fight, Nao-san! 
That is exactly what they all want you to do! Don&#39;t fall into their 
trap!&quot;

&quot;Dammit, Tokiha, stop bossing me around! Are you just going to let 
Sister go unavenged?&quot; Nao shot back, ripping her body free of Mai&#39;s 
grip.

&quot;You can&#39;t just try and kill Shizuru in a fit of rage!&quot;

&quot;Why not? She did it to me!&quot; Nao snapped back, her uncontrollable temper 
having flared up like the supernova of a dying star.

&quot;You&#39;re just going to get yourself killed if you storm in there without 
some kind of plan.&quot; She tried to reason, but Mai knew that it would 
probably do no good.

That quickly became even more evident. Nao&#39;s left eye twitched. &quot;If I&#39;m 
going to die so easily, then come and help me.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t kill her like that, it&#39;s not...&quot;

&quot;This woman is in complete control of everything she does! Her actions 
have consequences, and if no one else is going to give her her long 
overdue comeuppance, then I will!&quot; She waved her arm, Elements forming 
on her hands. Eyes turned to the rest of the gathering crowd. &quot;You all! 
You can follow this weak willed woman, or you can help me take her out 
before things get even more out of hand!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t even try to split the team up!&quot; Midori warned. &quot;That is exactly 
what the Obsidian Lord would want from us. Don&#39;t you see?&quot;

&quot;I see that you&#39;re all unwilling to do anything to protect your loved 
ones from that damned woman!&quot; Nao hissed. She pivoted on her heel and 
took off at a run, heading off in the direction that Kiyohime had gone. 
If she had to hunt that bitch throughout the entire city, then so be it! 
She remembered the fight that had taken place on the rooftop of Fuuka. 
Kiyohime&#39;s actions and Shizuru&#39;s abilities still rang fresh in her 
partially clouded mind. She stood a far better chance now.

Eyes darted from Nao&#39;s retreating form back to Mai, who hovered there 
unsure of what to do. It was a peculiar moment of hesitation. At their 
cores, everyone knew what they would do. They&#39;d sided even before the 
split occurred. Perhaps they hoped that something could be done, but 
what was there to do? Mai would never willingly try to kill one of her 
comrades unless it was absolutely necessary or if she lost grips with 
reality.

Azumi, a hardened warrior still in control of Natsuki&#39;s powers, fell 
back onto her lifetime ideal of &#39;kill or be killed.&#39; She knew nothing 
else. She was the first to join Nao&#39;s hunting party. Silently, Akira too 
ventured from the group. A woman of few words, and having always been a 
soldier and willing killer by nature, she found nothing wrong with a 
fatal duel with Shizuru. She wouldn&#39;t let Shizuru strike without 
warning, resulting in Takumi&#39;s sure death.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m not going to sit here and wait for that nutter to get me,&quot; 
Shiho said, somewhat ironically. A murderous and aggressive Ikusahime, 
and a downright mad Otome, she was more than willing. It would be a 
competition to see who was more out of their mind &#150; a duel of the crazy 
bitches. Shiho felt confident that she could win on at least one level 
or two.

To Mai&#39;s absolute shock and horror, the last person to move was Mikoto. 
&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing?!&quot;

The words that left the child&#39;s mouth were strangely grave. &quot;Shizuru 
will probably try to fight Mai by the end of it all, won&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;Well, who&#39;s to say that that will ever happen...?&quot;

Mikoto turned back to look at her guardian, if just for a moment. The 
expression she held was dark, as if she were still under the influence 
of Reito during the Last Carnival. She had willingly killed in Mai&#39;s 
name, and seemed to easily fall back onto that attitude. &quot;I won&#39;t let 
her. I won&#39;t let her hunt you down. I&#39;ll stop her before that ever 
happens!&quot;

Mikoto then scurried away, vanishing between a dense grouping of trees 
and underbrush. Mai attempted to pursue and stop her, but it was too 
late. The young girl was gone. Dammit! The others were in place, but the 
rift was a great threat when it came to stopping the Obsidian Lord. They 
would need the whole team, or at least most of it, to get anything done. 
The HiME Star... last time it only fell with the combined forced of the 
Children. If any more HiME perished, would they still have a chance at 
success?

&quot;What should we do?&quot; Akane asked, appearing to stay loyal to the less 
aggressive stance.

Mai sighed. &quot;Ah... well, we should try and find a way to destroy the 
Emulator before things get even crazier, but I don&#39;t know for certain if 
we have to destroy the Star first. Things are just... different. If we 
try to destroy the Emulator before the Star... do you think the Obsidian 
Lord program could transfer to a different machine and keep going?&quot;

&quot;I think it would be a likely scenario,&quot; Yukino agreed. &quot;Something that 
advanced would surely see imminent danger coming. If the Emulator here 
can established a network with the one at Garderobe, it could transfer 
the whole program to Earl if it was in peril &#150; or anywhere else on 
Earth, I would imagine. When did this first happen?&quot;

&quot;After we got hooked up to Garderobe&#39;s communication satellite, I think&quot; 
Akane informed. &quot;That was when we got called in, and shortly after, the 
Star arrived. I could be wrong.&quot;

Mai groaned in frustration. This was like a complex math problem. And 
she hated math. Bad. &quot;Okay, so... last time, the Obsidian Lord and 
Crystal Princess ruled the Star. But we couldn&#39;t destroy the Lord, 
because the Star acted as a defense mechanism. So I think... the same 
applies. Right? Oh, but the Emulator is a fairly self-sufficient 
machine, and...&quot;

&quot;Now, now, don&#39;t get overwhelmed. I think that your memories are sound 
and the same applies now. The Star probably has some tricks up its 
sleeve to keep us from killing the Lord until the end of the Carnival, 
like last time. It&#39;s too far away now, so all we can do is wait for it 
to near,&quot; Midori aided, giving Mai a reaffirming pat on the shoulder.

&quot;Guess our job is to try and keep everyone from killing each other for 
now, then. Great. First things first &#150; let&#39;s get Sister back to the HiME 
base and see if we can&#39;t get her to come to.&quot;

Mai was easily going to have the worst week ever.

- - -

Nao was more than pleased to see that someone was on her side for a 
change of pace. She could pack a greater punch if she had other fists at 
her disposal. When they&#39;d caught up with her, she led them all down into 
the city in order to find their now elusive prey. It was unavoidable. 
Shizuru had to be taken down before she could kill them all off one by 
one. If Natsuki died, then so be it. Everyone had to sacrifice something 
in order to achieve victory. Better the Obsidian Lord find a new, weaker 
host than possess the leader of the Otome. Natsuki would surely thank 
her from the afterlife.

&quot;We have to try and catch her off guard,&quot; Nao had told them, before 
properly setting off. &quot;Keep quiet and try to sneak up on her. Hand 
signals and all that. Don&#39;t speak or shout when she&#39;s in visual range.&quot;

And then they were off.

They were fortunate in that Azumi knew the city like the back of her 
hand. She led them to a tall, fairly intact skyscraper on the edge of 
town. It apparently offered an excellent view of the entire city, and if 
someone stealthy snuck up to one of the upper levels, they could spot a 
Child. Akira took up the task, climbing up the interior before moving to 
a balcony, hanging off the edge just enough to get the best view 
possible. Her eyes scanned streets and the skyline. Kiyohime was huge &#150; 
it shouldn&#39;t have been hard to spot! Shizuru must have sent the beast 
away for the sake of losing them. The rogue was no doubt on foot now, 
and Akira&#39;s eyes, no matter how honed, couldn&#39;t pick her out.

She was momentarily startled as something lightly patted her head. She 
looked up quickly, thinking someone was there, but crossed her eyes as 
something landed on the bridge of her nose. She stood on the balcony 
once again and held her hand out. Snow?

Perhaps the the snow would silence their own footsteps enough to where 
they could get the drop on her, Akira thought positively. Then again, 
Shizuru would have the same advantage, wouldn&#39;t she? Frowning once more, 
Akira descended from the building, rejoining her hunting party.

&quot;Well?&quot; Nao asked.

Akira shook her head. &quot;Nothing. She must have de-materialized her Child 
in an effort to lose us. We&#39;re just going to have to track her and her 
alone.&quot;

Nao clicked her tongue in disapproval, but Azumi offered another piece 
of advice. &quot;Perhaps she went back to Dammerung to report in? With a GEM, 
she would have had no means of communication. I&#39;m sure that Natsuki 
woman would want to know what happened.&quot;

&quot;Well, we have no other leads,&quot; Nao said. She pointed to the west. &quot;To 
Dammerung, then. Just keep on with the quiet and we should be fine. 
They&#39;re prepared to fight off an Orphan swarm, not a bunch of stealthy 
humans.&quot;

Snow quieting their footsteps, they slunk down alleys and through broken 
buildings to avoid detection by the Otome faction. In the distance, 
surrounding Dammerung, they could see their peers spread out in a wide 
circle to defend the great former palace from destruction. Surely there 
must have been a quiet way to get in there? If not, Nao was just fine 
with waiting for Shizuru to emerge once more. A trap was a much more 
effective way to catch a dragon than to assault it head on, after all.

- - -

&quot;Stupid bubuzuke woman,&quot; Haruka muttered angrily as she marched through 
the streets in nothing but her Otome uniform. The robe had been forsake 
after turning off her GEM in an effort to take herself off radar. 
&quot;Always so damned ambiguous. On every level of life. Can never keep 
track of her. Why can&#39;t she just sit still and speak her damned 
airheaded hippie mind?&quot;

It was the middle of winter, she had been walking for three miles, and 
to be honest, she had lost sight of Shizuru over half an hour ago. But 
she was Haruka Armitage! She could do things that no other mortal could 
possibly dream of. She didn&#39;t need rest! She didn&#39;t need food! All she 
had to do was focus on her task, and things would naturally fall into 
place due to her amazing skills and superior strength. Oh, but what she 
would have given for a nice winter overcoat...

Why couldn&#39;t Natsuki just tell everyone what her plan was? She&#39;d never 
been so tight lipped before, so what had happened to the headmistress 
that made her so quiet and suspect all of a sudden? Dismissing Ann, 
using Shizuru as her own personal agent and sending her off on solo 
missions, neglecting her command duties in lieu of sitting down by the 
psychotic Emulator... it was all just so strange! Haruka didn&#39;t like it 
one bit, so if Mashiro was going to send her to investigate, she would 
willingly comp--

There!

A flash of purple in between falling flakes of snow. Few people would be 
crazy enough to parade around in a kimono alone in this kind of weather. 
That had to have been her. Haruka, somewhat dramatically, dove behind a 
pile of debris to avoid being seen. Bright green was just as eye 
catching as purple, after all. Peering over the top, she watched Shizuru 
Viola walk back towards Dammerung, a red bardiche in hand. Weapon isn&#39;t 
that impressive, really. Just an oversized knife on a stick. Figures 
Viola would like that kind of thing.

Acting as if she were the lead character in a badly direct spy drama, 
Haruka scrambled under and over various things to &#39;stealthily&#39; follow 
her target, zipping across streets and open areas as quickly as she 
could. It was clear that Shizuru was heading back from whatever her 
&#39;mission&#39; was, but what had she been assigned to do? There was no way 
that Haruka could have gone and investigated that on her own. Snowfall 
would have covered up Shizuru&#39;s footprints by now. Curses.

Haruka had an urge to go up to her, grab Viola by the collar, and demand 
to know just what was going on. Haruka had always gotten what she wanted 
through force, after all. What was different about this time. Pushing up 
her sleeves, she began to head up the street, emerging from cover, but 
it was then that the spy noticed she was not truly alone. There were 
other spies in the area.

Her eyes fell upon the form of Akira Okuzaki and Nao Zhang. Ah! Traitor 
and diplomat! Both were highly wanted, and if she brought them in, she 
could help end the whole fiasco her organization was currently in. She 
was definitely more powerful than that licentious Column. She mentally 
debated with herself for a moment.

Look, Shizuru is already heading home. I can find her at Dammerung 
later. If I don&#39;t get these people now then I might never find them 
again! They&#39;ll slip away and ambush us later. Have to take them in 
before they can conspire to blow up the world or something. Right? 
Right. Have to. It&#39;s duty.

Haruka hit her GEM and it flashed back to life. A robe finding itself 
around her body, the suit naturally adjusting her body temperature to 
accommodate the cold weather (ah!), Haruka now had the power to go and 
intercept. She would just catch hell for sneaking off base without 
permission. That would be forgiven when Haruka gave her headmistress 
those two gifts. She dashed forward in the air, coming to rest just 
above and in front of both Nao and Akira.

&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing this close to Dammerung?&quot; She demanded. 
&quot;Are you going to surrender and stop this little playful rebellion of 
yours, or am I going to have to force you to?&quot;

Nao watched as Shizuru&#39;s head snapped around upon hearing Haruka&#39;s 
voice, and the kimono clad woman vanished from view after darting behind 
a building. Nao, pissed off at losing sight of her victim, glared back 
up at her former ally. &quot;Will you get out of the way, you obnoxious 
buffoon?! You&#39;re ruining everything! Don&#39;t you know how to be quiet for 
five minutes?!&quot;

&quot;Who do you think you&#39;re talking to, you little runt?&quot; Haruka shot back, 
tightening a fist and holding it up menacingly. &quot;This is no time to try 
and show off what you think is authority. You&#39;re going to come quietly 
with me, or go into Dammerung unconscious.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have time to get into a cat fight with you, Armitage. How about 
you move, or I make you move?&quot; Akira was tugging on Nao&#39;s shoulder, but 
the redhead ignored it. There were more important things to deal with.

&quot;You think you&#39;re pretty tough, don&#39;t you? Insolent kid.&quot; Haruka shot 
back.

&quot;If you don&#39;t get out of my way this instant...!&quot;

&quot;Surrender!&quot;

Akira watched in disappointment and worry as Nao and Haruka raced toward 
one another. The blonde general sent up a plume of dust and dirt as she 
slammed foot first into the ground at near top speed, Nao having slid 
out of the way. The redhead countered by extending her Element wires out 
to their maximum length, whipping them through the air with a furious 
wave of her arm. Haruka easily dodge four of them, but the wire attached 
to Nao&#39;s middle finger was just long enough to scrape against her robe, 
leaving a shallow cut in the Topaz robe&#39;s armor. Haruka was livid. She&#39;d 
gotten her armor messed up! The nerve!

Haruka materialized her Element and rushed towards her foe. Nao leapt 
back as the Quartz robe&#39;s falcata sword slammed into the street, 
cracking the asphalt into several pieces. As Haruka began to raise the 
weapon back up, Nao hooked her wires around the chain, preventing her 
from moving the weapon further. Both pulled on the Element with all 
their strength. Quite obviously, herculean Haruka had an advantage over 
the younger brawler. But Nao didn&#39;t have to win at their tugging game.

No one noticed the next attack, as the falling snow expertly masked the 
incoming bullet of ice. Azumi, perched on the ledge of a building, 
steadied a pistol on one arm and fired with amazing Ikusahime enhanced 
accuracy. Haruka heard the blast and felt a warm sensation running down 
her neck. After retrieving her Element from Nao, who gave up for fear of 
muscle fatigue, Haruka used her other hand to examine her skin. She 
returned her hand in front of her face and saw blood on her gauntleted 
fingertips. The warm sensation quickly turned to pain, and she ripped an 
ice shard out of her neck. Damn, there was another one of those 
Ikusahime witches!

She prepared to race up towards that Earth-born witch sword in hand, but 
found her arm trapped by Nao&#39;s wires. She growled and struggled to break 
her arm free. Another ice shard penetrated the armor that surrounded her 
leg, and her knee was set ablaze with ice induced pain. She was going to 
be a sitting duck if Nao interfered for much longer! But Haruka... had 
guts!

&quot;Zhang, take a hike!&quot; Haruka growled through a partially clenched jaw.

Using all her strength and her robe&#39;s flight capability, Haruka launched 
forward and twisted her body, throwing her arm &#150; and Nao &#150; forward. 
Azumi managed to drop down to street level as Nao, transformed into a 
projectile weapon, hit the building. The Ikusahime broke off a good 
chunk of the external wall. She roared in pain and dropped once more, 
falling to the same ledge Azumi had been perched on moments before. Her 
clawed fists grabbed hold of the side before she could roll off.

Azumi attempted to buy Nao enough time to recover, as their teamwork was 
essential. Her bullets still camouflaged by the snow, she fired with 
both her pistol Elements, sending a volley of ice headed Haruka&#39;s way. 
The blonde used the robe standard shield to block all incoming shots, 
holding it together for as long as necessary. The Quartz robe was a 
Column. It had the power to keep the shield operational for a relatively 
extended period of time.

She brought her sword arm up once again and prepared to go cut Azumi 
down, but heard yet another person join the fight with a battle cry. 
Haruka spun her body around, building up momentum, and lashed out with 
her weapon as she sensed the incoming enemy. Falcata met claymore as 
Mikoto&#39;s black blade slammed into her own, sparking as they met. Mikoto 
bounced back and landed on her feet, allowing her to charge forward 
again. The younger woman spun as she ran, her blade scratching along the 
frozen street. Having built up speed, Mikoto released it again. Had she 
a lesser grip, she would have likely thrown the damn thing halfway 
across the street!

Haruka managed to parry the strike, even though the blade was not her 
standard weapon. Lord, how she wanted her flail back! Still feeling 
uncomfortable, she fell back onto something more familiar. Haruka raced 
forward with her robe, just off the ground, and slammed her elbow right 
into Mikoto&#39;s stomach. The young girl lost the wind in her lungs and 
fell to the ground. One down for the moment! Better finish it up before 
the whole damn cult gets here!

She turned around to face the others once more, and saw Nao leap back 
down onto the street, having recovered from her little toss. Haruka had 
to watch out for that snare-and-shoot tactic! They&#39;d likely try it 
again. So, Haruka attempted to once again go close range. She rocketed 
forward and kneed Azumi back several feet, the HiME unable to match the 
speed of an Otome robe. That done, Haruka turned to the delinquent.

Nao rushed in to meet her, and in that moment, Haruka remembered that 
Nao was supposedly a hand-to-hand specialist. Not to worry, though! 
Haruka was far stronger, if lacking in technique. &quot;You should just sit 
down and give up now, Zhang!&quot;

Haruka attempted to backhand her, but Nao slipped under the strike and 
caught Haruka in the jaw. Well, so much for the boasting. Those damned 
claw knuckles left quite the mark! Haruka wondered if her skin had split 
open a bit from the force of the punch, but she was too busy to check. 
Enduring the pain, and refusing to be stunned by the hit, Haruka got Nao 
back when the redhead was still close. The blonde punched her in the 
head, and she heard Nao grunt in pain. The robe helped with the impact&#39;s 
power.

Nao hopped back and Haruka saw red claws extend from both hands. Oh, so 
there were more tricks, then? Wonderful! Nao fumed. &quot;That&#39;s it, bitch. 
You&#39;re going home with scars.&quot;

Haruka ducked under an incoming ice shard, courtesy of Azumi, and 
charged forward yet again. She attempted to land a slash against Nao, 
but the redhead jumped out of the way, only to dash in a moment later. 
Haruka was sure the claws wouldn&#39;t make it into skin, thanks to her 
armor, but they were apparently made of some otherworldly metal. When 
Nao struck, all five of her claws sank into Haruka&#39;s side. The blonde 
howled in rage more than pain, like a lion with a thorn in its paw.

Haruka brought her arm up and elbowed Nao on the collarbone, forcing her 
back. The claws left Haruka&#39;s side, blood trailing down her robe once 
the blade seals had been removed. Haruka then took to the sky, hoping to 
lose them both, if just for a moment. Diving down from above would give 
her an advantage. It was then, however, that she saw another combatant 
enter the field. Not Akira, but a Slave of some kind.

It was an ugly green blob, almost like a plant of some kind. Tentacles 
shot out from the ground, darting out towards their group. Their precise 
destination unknown at that rage, Haruka took it as a general attack. No 
Slave was going to interrupt this battle! She had to get Nao and the 
others to submit, and any distraction was a detriment!

&quot;Stupid thing, get lost!&quot; Haruka roared.

She flew towards it with narrowed vision, a product of her battle lust. 
Akira shouted something, but she did not hear. She could talk later &#150; 
had to get rid of the thing first. She used her sword as a lance, 
pointing it out. It&#39;d do more damage if she pierced the beast at full 
speed. Maybe even kill it in one shot. Nao, too, was trying to say 
something. Haruka only caught part of it.

&quot;...you idiot!&quot; What an asshole that Zhang was. Insulting her to her 
back? Didn&#39;t she have the courage to do it face to face?

&quot;Haruka-chan! Stop!&quot;

The final shout was from a shockingly familiar voice, and Haruka would 
have obeyed had it not been too late. She had been a fraction of a 
second away, and she couldn&#39;t break in time. The sword pierced the heart 
of the Slave, but what was a Slave? Yukino was bitching about nothing 
this time, Haruka was sure. She did that sometimes. Perhaps that just 
meant that Yukino was back to normal, and that Haruka could finally take 
her back to Dammerung without trouble.

The blade sank deep into the monster&#39;s flesh and she sliced up until the 
whole creature was divided in half. Triumphant, Haruka turned back to 
face Yukino&#39;s voice, raising her Element up in victory. Yukino, however, 
looked as if she&#39;d seen the walking dead. Her face was pale. Her eyes 
were wide. Tears threatened to drop. Haruka did not understand.

&quot;Oi, what&#39;s wrong with you?&quot; Haruka asked. Green sparks from the beast 
wafted into the air as the body began to break down.

&quot;Haruka-chan...&quot; That was all Yukino could manage before letting the 
tears fall. She covered her mouth with her hands, feeling as if she was 
going to be sick.

&quot;Eh? It&#39;s just a Slave, or Orphan, or whatever the hell. Don&#39;t tell me 
you were keeping it as a pet or something!&quot; Haruka tried to joke. Yukino 
only became more distraught. Tough crowd.

&quot;I can feel it,&quot; Yukino began to choke out. She clutched at her jacket 
near her chest area, feeling as if her heart was dying. She slowly began 
to walk forward, acting as if she&#39;d been shot. She had shaky breath. &quot;I 
can feel that same emptiness. Haruka-chan, do you know what you&#39;ve just 
done? You&#39;ve killed my soul &#150; my life force!&quot;

&quot;Huh? What kind of crazy talk is that?&quot; Haruka laughed again, but this 
time there was a great degree of nervousness behind it. Then, she felt 
it. In one moment, her heart gave a final loud beat. She heard it in her 
ears, and then everything was silent. And then... she remembered. She 
remembered the sensation and the pain, and the sense of realization as 
Fujino let that dragon devour Diana. Haruka could barely stand, but 
somehow found the willpower to do so. Her side, wounded from Nao&#39;s 
claws, was the first thing to go up in green sparks.

Yukino continued to move forward until she was right in front of her, 
both looking like they were on their last legs. &quot;You&#39;re always so 
eager... so ambitious. Your ultimate undoing, but it was always your 
most endearing quality. I don&#39;t know what will happen this time... but 
wait for me.&quot;

Then, to most everyone&#39;s surprise, Yukino did what she never had the 
courage to do in either lifetime. She was not going to make the same 
mistake again. Not now, not ever. Moving her head up, she planted a 
quick but loving kiss on Haruka&#39;s pale lips as the green cancer consumed 
the rest of her body, curling around her face, branding her like a neon 
tiger. Haruka was stunned, but managed to say her parting words.

&quot;I never knew you were a thespian.&quot;

Yukino kept silent as Haruka faded from sight, broken down to the 
molecular level and taken by the wind. Yukino&#39;s tears froze the moment 
they hit the frigid ground, and the now former president sank to her 
knees as she felt all the energy leave her body. Nao and the others 
watched, unmoving, as Yukino broke down completely. They hadn&#39;t 
technically killed Haruka, but if it hadn&#39;t been for them, then... Nao 
shook her head. No. Haruka started it. It was her own fault! ...Right?

Mai, too late to be the cavalry, descended from the heavens. The rest of 
her &#39;faction&#39; had run up to try and intervene with Yukino, but it had 
all ended so quickly. Mai naturally took her anger out on Nao, who was 
in charge of the group who had been fighting the deceased Haruka. &quot;Are 
you happy now? Now Haruka is dead and Yukino is damned!&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean for that to happen! She just offed herself. Like I could 
have controlled it!&quot; Nao countered. Not my fault, not my fault... don&#39;t 
make me into the bad guy again!

&quot;But if you hadn&#39;t been wanting to pick a fight we could have avoided 
this whole thing!&quot;

&quot;Well, how do you want me to fix it, grand leader?&quot;

Midori held her labrys out between them, hoping that the barrier would 
stop the shouting. &quot;Now, just calm down! There is to be no fighting 
between Ikusahime. This whole thing was the Obsidian Lord getting what 
he... er, she wants from us. To kill each other and end up divided. 
That&#39;s exactly what happened last time. So, just chill out for a 
second.&quot;

&quot;But we can&#39;t just let Shizuru get away!&quot; Nao protested.

Mai opened her mouth to once again counter that argument, but a very dry 
chuckle came from behind. All pivoted around to see the hunter in 
question standing there. The bardiche was gone. She looked as 
zombie-like as ever, her chestnut hair and her shoulders now covered in 
snow. &quot;How amusing. You&#39;d go to all this trouble for my sake when you 
don&#39;t even have anyone of value to protect? What puzzling and foolish 
people you are.&quot;

&quot;Fujino!&quot; Nao hissed. It was now or never! She extended her claws and 
prepared to run forward.

&quot;Ah, don&#39;t look at me like such a monster. You&#39;re responsible for as 
many Ikusahime deaths as I am. Stop trying to tell yourself otherwise, 
Yuuki-san.&quot;

Preferring that Shizuru keep silent, Nao sprinted forward to attack. 
When her claws came down, they tore through flesh, but it was not 
Fujino&#39;s. Her red talons sliced through the purple skin of an Orphan 
that materialized and reared up to defend Natsuki&#39;s knight in shining 
kimono. Nao frowned and retreated a step. That&#39;s right. The little scary 
child was likely ready to defend her precious sister-in-law. Stupid 
blonde punk wouldn&#39;t let anything happen to her, would she? Even if she 
knew it was for the world&#39;s own good, and even if unconscious, Alyssa 
would still try and play hero to defend her loved ones.

&quot;Poor Suzushiro-san. She always was the headstrong one,&quot; Shizuru almost 
mockingly lamented. She then smiled at the whole group, as if hiding 
something up her purple sleeves. &quot;If you&#39;re so set on splitting into two 
groups, the aggressive and the passive, then perhaps I can be of some 
value. I&#39;ll usher in the proper division. ...Kiyohime?&quot;

As Nao&#39;s group stood on one side, and Mai&#39;s on the other, it would not 
be difficult to divide and conquer the whole group. Shizuru chuckled as 
Kiyohime burst through the ground, forcing everyone to back off in their 
respective directions. The broken ground created a wall of dust that was 
difficult to see through, but the hydra&#39;s several heads were able to 
peer through and identify targets. Kiyohime let loose with her breath, 
spewing it in all directions. Everyone began to turn and run, heading 
into the city and into the mountains respectively, Midori scooping up 
Yukino&#39;s body as she fled.

And, as Tomoe came in with a group of Otome to further chase Nao&#39;s 
faction away &#150; but not harm them &#150; the division was complete. The 
Ikusahime were no longer fighting as one group, and for Shizuru, that 
would make things so much easier.

Natsuki watched as a second light illuminated on the Emulator panel. The 
second Key had been acquired. The Lord knew full well who&#39;s soul was 
trapped there. So Haruka has been killed, she thought. I&#39;m going to need 
a new team leader, then. It is her own fault for leaving without 
permission. She should have known better.

She stood, brushing her long coat into place, and exited Dammerung. Her 
green and yellow eyes turned up to the Otome acting as the defense team. 
Ann Lu was gone. Haruka was dead. Yukariko was useless. Many of the 
others had to do their part for the Carnival. So, who else could lead? 
Natsuki clicked her tongue. No one she would have preferred had it been 
an Otome-only conflict. But the grunts would have to do in a pinch. 
Might as well give the old room attendant some glory points. She&#39;d been 
a meister for a suitable amount of years.

&quot;Rosalie!&quot; Natsuki shouted. &quot;You&#39;re in charge of Haruka&#39;s team!&quot;

&quot;Why, onee-sama?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s dead.&quot;

Everyone naturally gasped in shock, but she didn&#39;t care. Her orders were 
given, and Rosalie, despite her desire to mourn, complied. As Natsuki 
headed back into the base, she was met with Mashiro&#39;s livid gaze. Ah, 
the queen was upset too, was she? Now what?

&quot;That&#39;s all you&#39;re going to do? Replace her and then go sulk in the 
command room some more? What is wrong with you?!&quot; Mashiro shouted.

&quot;She was careless.&quot; Natsuki then bent down a bit to look the teenager in 
the eyes. Her voice was stern, as if she knew something she wasn&#39;t 
supposed to. &quot;Haruka should have had her GEM on from the beginning. I 
wonder why she didn&#39;t want me knowing where she was?&quot;

Oh, shit.

Mashiro managed to keep her face neutral, but nearly cracked at least 
once or twice. Natsuki gave her a smirk and then turned back to the 
building, disappearing within. Mashiro was unsure of what to do. Would 
Natsuki just hold that conspiracy plan over Mashiro&#39;s head, or would the 
headmistress become the godfather and start capping bitches? Probably 
not worth the risk. Mashiro quickly ran to go find Arika, who was on one 
of the defense teams. But damn, which one? Her eyes scanned the sky. 
When she laid her hands upon her Otome, she ran forward.

&quot;Arika, come down here!&quot;

The brunette, clad in her blue robe, dropped down momentarily to see 
what the problem was. &quot;Hey, Mashiro, you shouldn&#39;t out here. There are 
too many monsters, and...&quot;

&quot;Natsuki&#39;s going to try and kill me.&quot;

At that, Arika gave her a long blank stare. &quot;...What?&quot;

&quot;You have to get me out of here, or at least stick with me in case she 
tries anything!&quot; Mashiro ordered.

&quot;But... I&#39;m not supposed to leave the line!&quot; Arika argued. &quot;I&#39;ll get in 
trouble. Orphans will break through and take down the whole place if I 
don&#39;t stay here.&quot;

&quot;You have to...&quot;

Rosalie noticed the gap in the perimeter, and as a swarm was 
approaching, she could not tolerate it. She snapped her whip in the air, 
getting everyone&#39;s attention. &quot;Yumemiya, get back up here now! There are 
monsters headed this way. Pull your weight, rookie!&quot;

&quot;Gah!&quot; With that little yelp, Arika raced back up and summoned her 
Element, ready to strike any incoming monster.

Mashiro panicked. Now what? She absently looked around, unsure of where 
to go to avoid the headmistress&#39; wrath. Her bodyguard was occupied and 
could not disobey. She had no national army at her disposal. No castle 
to hide in. No means of fighting on her own. She was completely and 
utterly screwed. When she felt a hand fall onto her shoulder, things 
only got worse.

She turned to find Xenia, one of the Earth Columns, standing there with 
her team. &quot;You know, if your meister is busy, we can take care of you.&quot;

Earth Columns. All subservient to Natsuki. Oh, double shit. All of them 
had their Elements out, and all gave her sinister glares. They had been 
given orders to make Mashiro disappear. Godmother Kruger. Mashiro gulped 
and did the only thing she could think of doing &#150; she ran. She ran and 
they followed, using the guise of protectors when all they really wanted 
to do was take her head and make it look like an accident. And by 
running, she gave them the one thing they needed. She would soon be out 
of visual range and in another part of the city. Alone and vulnerable.

There was to be no interfering in the Carnival. With the death of Queen 
Mashiro blan de Windbloom, Natsuki would make that perfectly clear.</pre>
