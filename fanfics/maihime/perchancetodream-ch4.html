<a href="../maihime/perchancetodream-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><p>A Mother’s Love</p><hr><i>Ara,
Natsuki! It’s been a while since I’ve written one of these
letters, so I felt like giving those two words their own sentence to
emphasize that I’m back to doing this now. I honestly didn’t
think I would be writing any more of these. My thoughts were that
once we were in a relationship, I wouldn’t have to go hiding my
thoughts from you anymore, and I could just tell you everything to
your face.</i></p><p><i>Well,
it turns out that’s half true. I don’t have to hide anything from
you, but that doesn’t mean I can simply tell you everything. I’m
just not around you enough to tell you every little thought that pops
through my head which you might be interested to know. You know, I
don’t really even need to qualify that sentence. I’m just not
around you enough. It relates to this, yes, but so much more as well.</i></p><p><i>I
guess maybe I’m just impatient. However many steps we take in our
relationship, it seems I’m always looking two or three ahead. Right
now, I’m not only thinking about the step where I get to return the
favor and bring you to your first orgasm (and I must say, I’m very
touched that you’ve been saving that for me), but I’m also
starting to think about having you move in with me. I’ve taken to
cleaning up one of the spare bedrooms in my house and setting it up
so you could live there in my spare time. Of course, I want us to be
sleeping in the same bed eventually, but this might be a good way to
ease you into things.</i></p><p><i>I
don’t think I’ve ever been this happy before, Natsuki. Sure,
there were a few individual moments that reached this level, like
when I first realized that you could indeed love me as I loved you,
and of course our first special night together passed this level. But
this sustained level of happiness is something new to me. I thought I
was in love with you before, but now that my love is returned, it
feels like my feelings have risen to a new level.</i></p><p><i>It’s
this feeling that’s giving me the courage to come out to my mother.
I’m so sure about our love, that it will be the easiest thing in
the world to tell her about it and hopefully let her share in my
happiness. After that’s done, I’ll just have to explain to her
that it’s with a girl. If I’ve already gotten her happy that I’m
in love, it should be a lot harder for her to turn around and start
to judge who I’m in love with.</i></p><p><i>To
be honest, I really don’t know if that would be much of a problem
to her in any case. She’s a very traditional Japanese woman, and
tradition does frown upon this sort of relationship. However, my
father has slowly broken her of many of the sillier traditions over
the years, so maybe she’d be open here. I’ve heard some stories
about children being disowned by their parents when they came out,
and I am a little worried, but I want to trust in my mother’s love
for me above any prejudices. I really don’t see how parents could
exist that could be that cruel to their children.</i></p><p><i>Well,
that’s all that I want to say for now. I don’t know what I’ll
do with this letter, really. I promised in the last one I wrote that
I’d start your special evening as you finished reading it, so I
can’t slip this one in after that. Maybe I’ll hang onto it for a
while, and when I get you to move in, I can open up this and any
other letters I’ve written for you to read. Well, I guess there’s
little point speculating about it here. When you’re reading this,
you’ll already know. Hopefully I’ve come up with something good!</i></p><p><i>Your
very happy girlfriend,</i></p><p><i>Shizuru</i></p><hr>“Ara
ara, your tea-brewing abilities certainly have improved, Shi-chan,”
Shizuru’s mother told her as she took a sip of the freshly brewed
green tea. Shizuru wanted to complain about the overly-cutesy
nickname, but she knew it wouldn’t do any good, so she settled for
simply rolling her eyes. The act didn’t go unnoticed by her mother,
though her only reaction was a slight twinkle in her eye that no one
outside of the family would have caught.</p><p>“You
say that as if I wasn’t any good before, Mama,” Shizuru replied.
She searched her memories for when she’d last had tea with her
mother. There were a few visits home in which her mother had made tea
for them, but the last time she’d done so for her mother was a bit
before she’d first left for Fuuka Gakuen. “I do believe that you
quite praised my skills the last time I prepared tea for you.”</p><p>“Just
because you were good then doesn’t mean there wasn’t room to
improve,” her mother replied. She took another sip of her tea,
allowing her enjoyment of it to show through on her face, perhaps
exaggerating it a little for her daughter’s sake. “Back then, you
mimicked my style almost perfectly. You’ve expanded a lot since
then, and you’ve come up with your own signature taste. I’m quite
proud of you, you know.”</p><p>Shizuru
gave her mother a small smile as she took a last sip and finished up
the tea in her cup. As she walked to the counter to refill her tea
from the kettle, she replied, “Thank you Mama,” with only a touch
of embarrassment from her mother’s praise. The woman didn’t give
out compliments lightly, so it was quite flattering to get it from
her. She didn’t feel like she really deserved it for her marginal
improvement in tea-brewing skills, but she wasn’t going to bother
arguing. The woman could be as stubborn as a rock when she wanted to
be.</p><p>“Not
just for that, dear,” her mother continued as Shizuru sat back
down. “You’ve done so well for yourself here. In High School, you
became Kaichou in a landslide victory, you were the most popular girl
in school, and you graduated at the top of your class. You’ve also
done quite a good job settling in here on your own, it looks like.”</p><p><i>Ara,
Mama, none of that is what really matters, </i>Shizuru
thought to herself in response to her mother’s further praise. <i>I
couldn’t care less if I had any of that. Winning Natsuki’s heart
is the only victory I need in my life.</i>

A smile formed on her face at the thought of her love despite her
attempts to keep a stoic expression. “Thank you, Mama,” was all
she said in response, however.</p><p>As
Shizuru peeked cautiously at her mother’s eyes, she found them
watching her with the precision of a hawk. Her mother’s ability to
pierce through her façade had unnerved her from an early age,
and however much she worked up a mask to hide her emotions, it was
never enough to keep her mother out. Sure enough, she was able to
peer into Shizuru’s thoughts now. “But there’s something else,
isn’t there?” she said with a small smile tugging at her lips.
“You’ve got something else you’re truly proud of.”</p><p>“Perceptive
as always, Mama,” Shizuru said, adding a little smile to her mask.
She considered whether to go forward and tell her mother about
Natsuki, but she decided to see what her mother might be able to
deduce on her own.</p><p>“It’s
not that hard to figure out,” her mother said. Shizuru caught a
small twinkle in her eye which she identified as one of the
indications of true happiness in her mother. “You’ve been
practically glowing since I came through the door. You’re either
taking some drug, or you’re madly in love, and I know I’ve taught
you better than to do any drugs…”</p><p>A
small warmth spread to Shizuru’s cheeks as her mother was able to
jump straight to the correct answer. Despite her best efforts, she
was never able to hide anything from the woman. No point hiding back
her giddiness any longer, then. She allowed a loving smile to creep
across her face as her thoughts drifted to Natsuki and the fact that
they were finally a couple. Allowing her happiness to show through in
her eyes as they met her mother’s, she said, “It’s
unbelievable, Mama. I’ve never felt this way before.”</p><p>Shizuru
felt a pang of pride as she saw her mother’s face light up in
happiness and one of her rare genuine smiles cross it. The happier
she was for her daughter, the more likely she’d be able to take the
news of just who her daughter was in love with well. “Isn’t it? I
felt just the same way with your father when he first won me over,
and it’s never quite faded away since.” She leaned forward, a
grin on her face that echoed the one Shizuru used whenever she was in
one of her mischievous moods, and said, “So. Tell me about this
boy.”</p><p><i>And
there it is. </i>Shizuru figured her
mother would have caught her slight flinch at the word “boy,” but
doubted her mind would jump to the correct answer. With a deep
breath, she plunged in, “Well, first of all… it isn’t a boy.”</p><p>Shizuru
held her breath in anticipation of her mother’s response. The woman
didn’t seem to ("too")
fazed by the news, however. After only a moment, a small smile struck
her face. “Ah, of course. So he’s a man then? That’s nice. Boys
can be too unreliable when it comes to matters of the heart.”</p><p>Shizuru
grimaced and sighed. Why did her mother have to force her to get this
out twice? She steeled herself with another deep breath and made sure
there could be no confusion this time. “No, Mama. It’s not a man,
either. The person who holds my heart, who’s made me this happy, is
a girl.”</p><p>Her
mother stared back blankly for a long period. The only reaction from
her was a series of rapid blinks, though her eyelids soon slowed to
their normal pace. After a torturous wait, eventually she replied
with a simple, “Oh.”</p><p>Shizuru
tried to gauge her mother’s state of mind, but the woman was a
blank slate to her. But even if she couldn’t read anything
directly, she could still try to infer. If her mother were completely
alright with this, she wouldn’t have withdrawn and would have shown
her support. On the other hand, if she were completely against this,
she would have tried to deny it or yelled or something – she could
be prone to fierce rages when angered. So, her state of mind must
have been somewhere in the middle. <i>I
think I can live with that. Even if she’s leaning negative, there’s
a possibility of convincing her to accept this.</i></p><p>When
nothing further seemed to be coming from her mother, Shizuru risked
pressing her for more information on the state of her mind. “I hope
you can understand, Mama, please…”</p><p>Her
mother took a deep breath followed by a long sip of her tea.
Eventually, she said, “So it’s a girl who you’re so deeply in
love with that you’re practically glowing with happiness?”</p><p>Shizuru
suppressed a wave of happiness. It wouldn’t do to seem overly
cheerful at this comment, even though it did sound promising. She
simply nodded in response, keeping her eyes respectfully lowered from
her mother’s.</p><p>Another
deep breath from her mother. “Then I’m happy for you,” she
said, not without a trace of hesitance. “If this… condition
allows you to be in love with someone who seems to be so perfect for
you, then I’m happy for that as well.”</p><p>It
wasn’t the most enlightened response possible, and she certainly
still had some regrets about it, but she was trying to be okay with
it and show that to her daughter. That was the part that really
mattered. Shizuru let a smile cross her face to let her mother know
that it was quite appreciated. “Thank you, Mama.”</p><p>Her
mother seemed to be trying to decide something for a moment, but she
quickly broke out into a grin. “Oh, come here, Shi-chan,” she
motioned her arms out to her daughter, signaling that she intended to
hug her. “I shouldn’t let my petty concerns stop me from simply
being happy for you.”</p><p>Shizuru
briefly thought of how long it had been since her mother had offered
to hug her like that. It hadn’t been since she’d first left to
Fuuka. They’d just never had a chance in private on her previous
visits, and she wasn’t generally one for outward displays of
emotion in any case. This all served to make it all the sweeter a
gesture for her, and Shizuru certainly wasn’t going to begrudge her
that. She got up and moved around the table to allow her mother to
grip her in a loving hug.</p><p>As
she broke from the hug, her mother’s last words finally sunk into
Shizuru’s mind. “Um, Mama,” she said as she sat back down.
“What concerns were you talking about?”</p><p>“Oh,”
her mother said, reverting her expression back to her usual mask as
she took a sip of her tea. “Just about how society might treat you
for this… This kind of thing still isn’t very well accepted here,
and…”</p><p>Shizuru
nodded. She was aware of the potential issues, but she wasn’t in
much of a state of mind to care about them presently. Still, it
seemed like her mother still had something else on her mind.
“‘And’…?” she prodded.</p><p>Another
sigh, another sip of tea, another deep breath. “The day you were
born, Shi-chan, was one of the happiest days of my life. Since you
blossomed into a woman yourself, I’ve been hoping that you could
experience that joy too, along with all the other joys that come from
raising a child and seeing them mature. I guess you can see the
problem this poses…”</p><p><i>Is
that a blush on her face?</i> Shizuru
stared at her mother’s cheeks, but the pink tinge was gone, if it
had ever been there in the first place. Pushing those thoughts out of
her mind, Shizuru let her mind focus on what her mother had said.
She’d never really considered having children herself; it seemed
like she was still far too young. But if she ever did want to… then
yes, there could be some problems.</p><p>Shizuru
nodded at her mother. “Ara, I see what you mean, Mama,” she said.
“There are still options, though, I think. We could always adopt,
or there’s getting a sperm donor. Though I’m not really sure
about that one; I couldn’t imagine having that kind of connection
with anyone other than Natsuki…”</p><p>Her
mother shook her head, and she reached out a hand to grasp one of
Shizuru’s. “Don’t worry about that, Shi-chan. That’s just an
old woman being a bit sentimental. You and ‘Natsuki’ can decide
whatever you want to do yourselves in due time.”</p><p>“Right,”
Shizuru said, bringing her other hand in to grasp her mother’s.
“Thank you, Mama.”</p><p>“Now,”
her mother said, her demeanor perking up and a twinkle forming in her
eye. “Tell me about Natsuki.”</p><p>A
smile split across Shizuru’s face. “Ara ara… where to begin…?”</p><hr>“…she
finally came to realize the nature of her feelings and admitted that
she loved me as well,” Shizuru said, finishing her description of
her relationship with Natsuki on her profession of love. She left out
the little detail of what exactly Natsuki was doing to her when she
made that confession, as her mother probably wouldn’t appreciate
hearing about that. “We’ve been an official couple since then,
with all the giddiness that brings in me.”</p><p>A
smile had been steadily spreading across her mother’s face
throughout Shizuru’s story. Perhaps she was still a bit uneasy with
her daughter dating a girl, but she seemed to be getting over it if
she was. “She certainly sounds like quite the girl,” she said as
her daughter finished up. She instinctively moved to take a sip of
her tea, but her cup and the kettle had finally been drained. “For
someone to be left on her own from such a young age and turn out so
well, she must be very strong.”</p><p>“It
hasn’t always been easy for her,” Shizuru admitted, reflecting on
her recent conversation with Natsuki over their date. “She still
feels the pain of not having a family sometimes. But she is strong,
yes, so she gets by.”</p><p>Her
mother gave a knowing smile. “I think you might have a big role in
that as well, judging by what you’ve told me of your relationship
with her. In any case, at this time, it would seem you’re playing
the role of the closest thing to family she’s got.”</p><p>Shizuru
thought of what she’d told Natsuki about her parents possibly
taking the girl in and acting as a surrogate family. It seemed all
the more likely now. If her mother was this accepting of their
relationship; her father would be a piece of cake. Of course, things
wouldn’t be able to move too quickly, but it was a nice future plan
to work towards, and probably the closest thing to marriage she could
get, barring a miraculous change in Japan’s marriage laws. With
this thought in mind, she smiled and gave her mother a nod.</p><p>Checking
her watch, but more likely thinking of the empty teacup, her mother
regretfully stood up from the table. “Ara, it seems I’d better be
off so I can catch my train home. It’s been quite a pleasure
visiting you, Shi-chan.”</p><p>“You
too, Mama.”</p><p>“Let
me know when you’d like me to come up next. I’m really interested
to meet this Natsuki of yours,” she said. Her choice of words
implied to Shizuru that she was asking her daughter to let her know
when Natsuki was ready to meet her.</p><p>“Of
course, Mama,” Shizuru said, giving her mother a small smile. “I’m
sure she’ll enjoy meeting you as well.” <i>After
she gets past all of her usual, so cute nervousness about facing the
prospect, that is.</i> Shizuru’s smile
involuntarily widened at the thought of a nervous Natsuki blushing
from the thought of meeting her parents.</p><p>Her
mother caught the motion, and even if she didn’t know exactly what
it meant, she acknowledged it with a quick wink. “I love you,
Shi-chan,” she said as she started heading out.</p><p>“I
love you too, Mama.”</p>
