<p>“<em>Well, it’s finally time,”</em> Natsuki thought to herself, straightening out her uniform top as she took one last glance in the mirror.</p>
<p>She  had only just arrived back at Garderobe this afternoon along with  Shizuru, Anh Lu, and King Bao. During that time, Headmistress Oleander  had promptly shoved a stack of books at her, instructing her that her  studying was to commence the very next day since she was going to be  attending the anniversary party tonight.</p>
<p>Although she took the  books without a word, Natsuki still hadn’t decided on what she was  going to do about the Gakuenchou’s offer. She hadn’t had the time to  really think about the situation since she’d been occupied with  spending time with Shizuru in Annam.</p>
<p>“<em>What am I supposed to do? Become the new Headmistress? Go back home? Either way, I’m going to be letting someone down…”</em></p>
<p>Messaging her temples, the soldier continued her trek towards the dancehall as she pondered her future.</p>
<p>“<em>Now’s  not that time to worry about this. Oleander-sama told me to enjoy this  evening…Eh, but how am I supposed to do that around a bunch of ruling  royalty? I don’t predict this night to be very fun at all…”</em></p>
<p>With  a sigh, Natsuki trudged her way up the stairs and onto the veranda that  was packed with people, scanning the faces for her friend all the  while, but it wasn’t until after she had entered the building that  Natsuki finally spotted her.</p>
<p>Shizuru was adorned in a black  formfitting dress, it’s thin straps rolling over her soft, yet strong  shoulders. The outfit, that's hem was lined with lace, draped down to  her ankles, the slit on the right side reaching up to her thigh  occasionally flashing glimpses of the pearly white skin beneath.</p>
<p>Natsuki swallowed at the sight, suddenly finding her mouth unusually dry.</p>
<p>As  she began to take her first step towards the goddess across the room, a  hand grabbing her by the upper arm suddenly halted her movement.</p>
<p>“Excuse me miss, I’ve never seen a uniform like that before. What country does it belong to?”</p>
<p>“The  Republic of Vedel,” Natsuki informed the older man who was also adorned  in a military uniform, taking note that it belonged to the Army of  Florince.</p>
<p>Before she knew it, the girl was immersed in a  conversation with several other military leaders. They exchanged war  stories and battle tactics, and Natsuki found herself naturally  intrigued, actually adding to the discussion here and there, especially  when the curious men questioned her about her home country.</p>
<p>Eventually  the talk came to a lull, and glancing back over where she had seen  Shizuru chatting with some other Otome earlier, she was surprised to  see the woman staring back as if she’d been watching her for a while  now.</p>
<p>After eye contact was established, the Column immediately  began walking over, and Natsuki quickly excused herself from the men to  meet her friend partway.</p>
<p>“Ara, I’m glad to see that my date finally showed up.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a date,” the emerald-eyed girl argued, “Oleander-sama requested that I attend, so I had to come anyway.”</p>
<p>“Hm, I see,” Shizuru muttered, “By the way, who were those men you were speaking with?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh, just some military commanders.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“What? Is there something wrong with that?”</p>
<p>“No, not really…It's just that they kept you away from me.”</p>
<p>“S-Sorry,” the girl stated, causing the older woman to chuckle softly.</p>
<p>“Well, now that we are together, how about a dance?”</p>
<p>The other frowned, “…Do we have to?”</p>
<p>“Please?” Shizuru pressed, stretching out her hand.</p>
<p>With a huff, Natsuki consented, taking the offered hand in her own, “Fine.”</p>
<p>The  two made their way out on the ballroom floor just in time for the small  orchestra to start up their next tune, both women breaking apart to  turn and face one another once they had found an open space.</p>
<p>“How perfect. You do remember this one, don’t you?”</p>
<p>The raven-haired girl just smirked, “How could I forget? This <em>is</em> the dance you drilled into me.”</p>
<p>“Let’s see if my lessons paid off then,” Shizuru replied, a playful little smile on her face, “Lead the way.”</p>
<p>And  Natsuki did just that. Taking the woman’s hand once again, she pulled  Shizuru closer to her body, sharp emerald eyes piercing into crimson  pools, as in unison they took the first step.</p>
<p>Seamlessly they  glided across the dance floor along with the other couples, keeping in  rhythm with the mid-tempo beats with elegant ease.</p>
<p>“It would seem that Natsuki does remember,” Shizuru remarked before spinning outward.</p>
<p>Upon her return, the younger girl was quick to respond, “I had a good teacher.”</p>
<p>More  spiraling strides were made, the two women weaving their way through  the crowd unconsciously as they recounted earlier days.</p>
<p>“I do recall you being rather cross with me at the time though.”</p>
<p>“What? Because you were <em>forcing</em> me into it? Of course I was angry.”</p>
<p>“You <em>did</em> ask for help—”</p>
<p>They parted again, pausing their conversation, before slipping back into position.</p>
<p>“—and you <em>did</em> pass the exam.”</p>
<p>Natsuki scoffed, “That still doesn’t mean I enjoyed it. Dancing has never been one of my strong points.”</p>
<p>“I think you’re doing fine right now,” Shizuru commented, “You’ve been flawless in your steps.”</p>
<p>“How would you know that? You’ve been looking me straight in the eye this entire time.”</p>
<p>“I would <em>feel</em> it if you messed up,” the woman whispered suggestively into Natsuki’s ear before twirling outward again.</p>
<p>On  this draw back, however, Shizuru wasn’t expecting Natsuki’s stronger  pull and slid in her heels past where she should of stopped, but still  managed to maintain her balance once she did come to a halt.</p>
<p>Their  faces were mere inches away, noses actually brushing along with their  heaving chests. Time seemed to stand still for the two as they stared  into one another’s eyes, both keenly aware of their closeness, and both  not caring that the dance was still continuing around them.</p>
<p>And  then the intimate moment was shattered, Natsuki grimacing before  stumbling back a few steps, drawing her left arm to her body.</p>
<p>“Natsuki—?!”</p>
<p>“It’s alright. Just a little twinge is all.”</p>
<p>Before  anything else could be said, a voice across the room called out  Shizuru’s name, and she and Natsuki both turned to seek out the source.</p>
<p>What they saw was a group of political leaders along with Headmistress Oleander, one of the men waving the older girl over.</p>
<p>Rather  than address the group, Shizuru turned back to Natsuki with concerned  eyes, but before she could question her friend, Natsuki cut her off.</p>
<p>“Go on.”</p>
<p>“But—“</p>
<p>“I’m  fine, Shizuru,” the girl reassured with a weak smile, “Besides, it’s  not every day that these politicians get to speak with the Graceful  Amethyst herself.”</p>
<p>The chestnut-haired woman didn’t look  convinced, but silently obeyed, slowly and reluctantly making her way  across the floor as she slipped back into her usual contented composure.</p>
<p>Natsuki  watched her friend’s retreating back, sighing softly before weaving her  way through the mass of people to make it outside, and once she had  distanced herself from the building, she finally allowed herself to  express her discomfort.</p>
<p>“Damn, that hurt…” she cursed under her breath, gazing down at her incased forearm.</p>
It  still did hurt. In fact, it had hurt the entire time she and Shizuru  had been dancing, Natsuki somehow finding the strength to cover up her  pain and keep going for her friend’s sake, but now she was beginning to  get anxious about constant ache that seemingly wasn’t going away.
<p><em>&quot;That was so stupid…but…Shizuru did look happy…If she was having a good time, then it was more than worth it.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Trying to move the limb again, Natsuki gritted her teeth as a sharp pain coursed under her skin.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Eh, maybe I should go see Youko just to be safe…&quot;</em></p>
<p>And with that final thought, the girl headed in the direction of the underground infirmary.<em><br />

<strong>Chapter Notes</strong>:
<p>1. I imagine the ballroom dance containing elements from Bolero and  Foxtrot. I’m pretty ignorant when it comes to dance styles and  terminology, so if you’re curious about either of those, just go to  YouTube like I did XD</p>
