<p>“How long is that  damn meeting going to last?” Natsuki whined out loud as she shut  the book on the desk in front of her a little more forcefully than  intended.</p>
<p>Nearly two hours had  passed since Shizuru had left, time in which the young Vedelian had <em>tried</em> to occupy herself with her studying, but she had only  managed to skim through a couple of pages…and honestly couldn’t  remember what those pages said. The girl knew very well why she  couldn’t focus, it was because she kept playing the scene that had  taken place earlier in Shizuru’s room repeatedly in her mind, and  every time that it did, she couldn’t ignore the heat that radiated  from her entire body because of it.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure  this is some form of torture…” she mumbled to herself with a pout  as she leaned back in her wooden chair, the front legs rising  slightly off the ground as she clasped her hands behind her head.</p>
<p>Shizuru <em>had</em> kissed her earlier, right? That wasn’t just some wonderful dream  Natsuki had conjured in her head…It couldn’t be.</p>
<p>Again the girl found  her index finger lightly tracing over her lips.</p>
<p>No, it had definitely  been real. No questions about it. That confirmation was now firm in  her mind…mostly, anyway.</p>
<p>“<em>The real question  is what am I gonna do about it?”</em> she couldn’t help but ponder  as the corners of her mouth irked downward.</p>
<p>It was about time for a  confession, it was long overdue, but Natsuki wasn’t entirely sure  if she’d be able to go through with it all. She could practice all  she wanted, think about what she wanted to say and plan it all out  before hand, but having those beautiful russet-colored eyes looking  at her…to have Shizuru that close…those factors added a whole new  spin on the game.</p>
<p>Shifting her weight  forward, the chair landed on all fours once again with a loud thud as  Natsuki rummaged a hand through her hair in frustration, leaving her  dark tresses in a mess.</p>
<p>“<em>Why does she have  this kind of effect on me? How can a single person do that and not  even be aware of it? …I wonder if I do the same to Shizuru…”</em></p>
<p>That final thought made  her smirk once again, accompanied with a small laugh.</p>
<p>“<em>Nah, I doubt it.  Shizuru’s always so collected, if she was ever flustered, I don’t  think anyone would know about it.”</em></p>
<p>Now that she really  thought about it, Shizuru rarely ever did become emotional in front  of other people. Occasionally Natsuki would see a change, but for the  most part the older woman was reserved and calm, keeping an even tone  despite the situation.</p>
<p>“I wonder how well I  really do know her—“ the emerald-eyed girl began, but was cut off  by the light rapping at her door.</p>
<p>“Natsuki?” the  distinctive accent came from behind the wooden structure, obviously  recognizable as Shizuru.</p>
<p>“Just a sec,”  Natsuki stalled, giving herself a moment to blindly comb through her  hair as best as she could with her fingers before walking over to the  door and opening it.</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>“Hey, come in.”</p>
<p>“Ookini.”</p>
<p>Doing so, Shizuru  walked through the doorway, and wasted no time in settling down on  the nearby bed.</p>
<p>“So what was that all  about?” Natsuki questioned after closing the door behind her and  proceeding to take a seat by her friend.</p>
<p>“A meeting between  the Columns and the Windbloom Officials. They were curious about what  was happening in the surrounding countries that we’ve been visiting  over the past few months.”</p>
<p>“Is something  stirring up behind the scenes?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem  that way…at least not at the moment. I hope it stays that way,”  the woman replied somewhat somberly before brightening once again,  “But this is not what Natsuki wished to discuss, is it?”</p>
<p>The girl blinked, “Uh,  y-yeah, right.”</p>
<p>“What is it then that  you wanted to speak with me about?“ Shizuru asked, her head tilting  slightly causing her tawny locks to sway, ruby orbs staring at the  girl beside her intently.</p>
<p>“<em>D-Don’t look at  me that way,” </em>Natsuki screamed in her head,<em> “you’re  gonna break my concentration!”</em></p>
<p>“U-Um…”</p>
<p>“Yes—“</p>
<p>The girl squeezed her  eyes tightly shut.</p>
<p>“<em>Come on! Stupid  tongue! Just spit it out!”</em></p>
<p>Natsuki’s green orbs  flashed open again, meeting the deep red pools beside her.</p>
<p>“I LOVE YOU!”</p>
<p>The words had left her  mouth before she fully realized it, and Natsuki’s vibrant viridian  eyes widened as reality sunk in and her face quickly reddened. Even  Shizuru looked taken aback by the sudden outburst.</p>
<p>“Natsu—“</p>
<p>“I love you…Shizuru,”  the Vedelian repeated, far more controlled this time, “I…I’ve  loved you for a long time…whether I realized it or not…”</p>
<p>Dropping her gaze to  the floor in front of her, Natsuki continued, “I should have said  something a long time ago. I don’t know why I didn’t…It’s  just that…you’re so perfect…and…”</p>
<p>The girl paused to  sigh, “I’m sure you’re tired of hearing these things from  people, but…I just couldn’t hold it back anymore…”</p>
<p>“Natsuki…” the  older woman breathed the girl’s name in a way only she could.</p>
<p>Suddenly taking action,  the raven-haired girl grabbed Shizuru’s hands between her own, “I  need to—no, I <em>have</em> to know…do you…do you—“</p>
<p>Shizuru’s lips  clashing against her own silenced Natsuki on impact, and the Vedelian  willingly submitted as the older woman leaned over her until  Natsuki’s back was flat on the bed.</p>
<p>“Baka,” the  chestnut-haired Column whispered once she had pulled back, still  maintaining her dominating position over the girl, and it wasn’t  until then that Natsuki noticed the tears forming in her ruby eyes.</p>
<p>“Shizuru—“</p>
<p>“I love you too,  Natsuki. For such a long, long time, I’ve—”</p>
<p>This time it was  Natsuki who cut off Shizuru with another deep kiss, arms wrapping  around the woman above her before using her strength to turn the  tables and taking the top position.</p>
<p>What started on the  lips quickly moved to the jaw and proceeded to the neck, and it was  there that Natsuki cursed the starch-white cloth that prevented her  from tasting any more of Shizuru’s fiery skin. Moving back to the  woman’s lips, the young Vedelian parted her own, allowing her  tongue to slide over Shizuru’s lips before the woman allowed her  access to the inside of her mouth.</p>
<p>At the initial contact  of their curious tongues, both women moaned, Shizuru’s nails  digging deeper into Natsuki’s back, the thin material of her tank  top providing little cushioning.</p>
<p>Eventually pulling  back, the girl hovered her face mere inches above the other’s,  noses brushing as half-lidded eyes met, “I didn’t mean to take  things so quickly…”</p>
<p>“I’m certainly,”  a breath, “not complaining…”</p>
<p>Natsuki smirked, “I’m  not either, but…”</p>
<p>Pausing, the girl  unstraddled herself from the older woman, lying down beside her on  the bed as she rested her head on Shizuru’s chest, eyes closing,  “…can we just stay like this…for a while…”</p>
<p>An amused noise sounded  from the Columns throat before she kissed the top of Natsuki’s  head, a hand easily finding it’s way into the girl’s hair.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
