<a href="../maihime/letter4u-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Dear Takumi,

Your prediction was off by a week. Yuuichi asked me to marry him 
tonight after dinner. He had this weird look on his face, you know the 
one he gets when he tries to look serious. When he tried to get on one 
knee, Yuuichi tipped his chair over and made a waiter drop the desserts 
all over them both. And that&#39;s how he proposed, covered in bavarian cream 
and chocolate mousse!

But I wouldn&#39;t trade that memory for anything. At least it&#39;ll be an 
entertaining story to tell our children. Children! I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m 
thinking that far ahead! Though it&#39;s not such a bad thought, having 
Yuuichi&#39;s children. 

By the way, Chie said she saw Mikoto the other day. She was out with 
Kikukawa Yukino from school. (from the student council, remember?) 
I honestly didn&#39;t know what to think or feel about that. When she 
moved out I thought that there was nothing left between us. At least 
not what she&#39;d been hoping for. 

Do you think I should call her? I really want her there for the 
ceremony but with our history it might be awkward. I told you some of 
what happened the last month she was here. But I never told you how bad 
it really was. 

Mikoto was just so hurt all the time. I wanted to spare her all that. 
I honestly wished I could have been everything to her. But a lover? 
That&#39;s just not who I want to be. Maybe I could have handled it better, 
but Mikoto&#39;s at fault too. Demanding that I make a choice between her 
and Yuuichi was just unfair. 

When I refused to make that choice she started packing. Maybe I&#39;d come 
to expect Mikoto to be there for me, to always be there, waiting. I 
never thought she&#39;d choose to leave. 

I&#39;m afraid Takumi. It was a simple choice. I&#39;m straight and I love 
Yuuichi and I want to make a life with him. But Mikoto has a place in 
my heart that no one else can take. I can&#39;t explain it well and I don&#39;t 
want to understand it. 

I don&#39;t know why I&#39;ve written so much. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to send 
this letter now, but I just couldn&#39;t stop writing. This was supposed 
to be me announcing my engagement but all I&#39;ve done is write about 
Mikoto. 

The fact is I haven&#39;t accepted the proposal yet. I don&#39;t know what 
to do next. 

Takumi, what should I do?

Your loving sister,

Mai</pre>
