<P>“You had to get us
kicked out of the boarding house, didn't you?” Mai Tokhia
complained good naturedly, the busty orange haired teen dressed in a
simple blouse and red skirt. They were sitting down in one of the
parks around Fuka, sitting on several pieces of their collected
luggage. It was a tough situation for them, made worse that both had
only just transferred to the remote Fuka Academy.</P><P>“It wasn't my fault!”
Natsuki Kuga snapped back, the slimmer young woman's black hair
shining around her. “Help me check this list of apartments in
Fuka.” She looked rather boyish in her trousers and shirt, holding
a hand written sheet in her hands.</P><P>“Not your fault?” Mai
raised her eyebrow as she looked over the list, “I think shooting
off a pistol at three in the morning would annoy anyone.”</P><P>“There was that damn
pervert again,” Natsuki grumbled. She hesitated a moment, “I'm
sorry you got tossed with me, roomie.”</P><P>“It's all right,” Mai
shrugged. The boarding house manager did have a point that Mai should
have been trying to restrain Natsuki a bit... “I just hope we don't
have to sleep outdoors tonight,” she sighed.</P><P>“There's still places
we can try,” Natsuki said with a determined look in her eye. She
got up, “We've rested enough, let's go.”</P><P>“Right,” Mai agreed,
picking up her luggage and trudging after Natsuki.</P><P>Sadly, their attempt to
find a place to stay was mostly coming up empty. School housing was
full up, the few rooms for rent on the notice boards were now
occupied and the only hotel in Fuka charged so much they'd be out of
rent money in a few weeks, tops. They left Haruka Suzushiro's home,
coming up to the edge of a fenced property and going around it.</P><P>“Well that was fun,”
Natsuki growled.</P><P>“I really wasn't
expecting Haruka to let us use her spare room,” Mai shrugged, “now
that Yukino's moved in.”</P><P>“You think that
they're...?” Natsuki raised a eyebrow as they followed along the
wall towards what looked like a front gate.</P><P>“That's the story I
heard,” Mai agreed as they walked by the gates. She saw something
posted on the wall and blinked, “Oh ho!”</P><P>The notice read in
elegant script, 'Housekeeper wanted. Room and board provided, wages
and other details open to discussion.' It was posted beside a
smaller, pedestrian gate which was also unlocked.</P><P>“Housekeeper?”
Natsuki looked doubtful.</P><P>“I cook, you clean,”
Mai suggested excitedly. She gestured to the massive wall, “Clearly
they're loaded, so why not try?”</P><P>Natsuki felt a odd chill,
but she also couldn't really argue with Mai. “All right,” she
agreed as she pushed open the gate, “let's go.”</P><P>Within the building in a
security room a figure watched on view screens the two women who
walking up the path to the house. “Not quite what I expected,”
the voice murmured thoughtfully, “but there are possibilities
here.” A smile teased lips, “Interesting possibilities.”</P><P>Together Mai and Natsuki
made it to the main doors, but not without mishap. In trying to keep
Mai from slipping Natsuki had taken a spill, smudging dirt all over
her black pants. “Sorry Natsuki,” Mai said sheepishly.</P><P>“It's all right,”
Natsuki sighed as she knocked on the door.</P><P>It was only a few moments
when the door was answered and both Natsuki and Mai blinked in shock.
The taller, brown haired woman was dressed in a fine purple kimono,
her slightly red irised eyes gazing at them with amusement. Her age
was difficult to guess, anything from their own age to someone much
older, her appearance both youthful and experienced.</P><P>“Well, well,” she
drawled, “what have we here?”</P><P>Mai managed to recover
first as she said, “I'm Mai, this is Natsuki.” She bowed a bit,
”We were wondering about the housekeepers job?”</P><P>“My name is Shizuru
Fujino,” she also bowed gracefully, “and I haven't filled the
position just yet.” She gestured for them to enter as she noted,
“I wasn't expecting two teenagers, however.”</P><P>“We had a unexpected
problem with our housing,” Natsuki offered as they set the luggage
down by the doors then followed Shizuru inside, “but I hope we can
resolve it soon.”</P><P>“Ah see,” Shizuru
murmured as they walked through the massive empty home. “As you can
see I live here all alone,” she informed them, “I inherited this
after my parents passed away, but it's much too big for me.”</P><P>“I'm sorry for your
loss,” Mai said politely as they tried not to gawk at the interior
like country bumpkins. The halls were paneled with the finest wood,
the upper sections decorated with high quality wallpaper. Pictures
and prints of high quality lined the walls while vases and objects of
art rested on pedestals along the way.</P><P>“Thank you,” Shizuru
said with gentle dignity as she lead them into a sitting room.
“Please sit,” she waved them towards chairs, “And we'll discuss
the house keeper's position.”</P><P>Mai sat right down but
Natsuki hesitated, looking at her mud splattered legs. “I'll
stand,” she smiled sheepishly, “I don't want to damage your nice
furniture.”</P><P>Shizuru rose gracefully
as she walked to Natsuki's side. Taking her hands she murmured, “I'm
being a terrible hostess. Let me help....”</P><P>In a surprisingly short
amount of time Natsuki's and Mai's clothes were in a fancy washing
machine and the two women were entering a surprisingly large bath in
another part of the building. “Wow,” Mai breathed out as she took
in the high arched ceiling and bubbling waterfall feeding into a pool
sized bath.</P><P>“With such a fancy
washer and all the other stuff,” Natsuki noted as she scrubbed the
dirt away, “why does she need a housekeeper?”</P><P>Mai practically dived in,
splashing around happily. “Maybe she's lonely?” Mai offered as
she stretched, breasts bouncing.</P><P>“Maybe,” Natsuki
frowned, knowing that there was something about Shizuru that bothered
her.</P><P>Back in the security room
Shizuru settled into a seat, gazing at monitors that showed the fully
nude Natsuki and Mai. Her breath came faster as she saw Mai's full
breats but seemed to deepen as she took in Natsuki's lean form. She
could have simply invited herself into the bath, of course, but
Shizuru found it oddly more exciting to watch them this way. The
illicitness turned her on, as did her other plans....</P><P>“What is this?!”
Natsuki stomped into the sitting room later, her black miniskirt
clinging to her hips, the little white apron floating above it. The
top was closer to a corset than any maid's blouse, the black cloth
squeezing tight as the breasts were expertly cupped in white silk
ruffles.</P><P>“You don't like it?”
Shizuru asked innocently as she fought to keep any excitement from
her face and voice. Seeing Natsuki in the fetish maid costume made
her heart pound, as did the somewhat more full figured Mai.</P><P>“It's a little racey,”
Mai offered diplomatically.</P><P>“It's a lot racey!”
Natsuki yelped.</P><P>“I'm so sorry,”
Shizuru murmured, “I ordered more generic maid's uniforms, but that
was what I was sent.” Apologetically she added, “I thought you
might prefer those to wearing your still damp clothes, that's why I
put them, out for you.”</P><P>“Thank you,” Mai said
a bit dubiously as she tugged on the short skirt, Natsuki continuing
to give Shizuru a suspicious look.</P><P>Shizuru hid a smile as
the girls sat, the short skirts offering a lovely view of their
thighs and panties. Opening her hands she said, “I'm willing to
hire you at 900 yen a hour to start, with free room, board and
uniforms. As you are students I'll also leave you time free for class
assignments. What do you think?”</P><P>“I'll take it,” Mai
declared.</P><P>“Mai,” Natsuki hissed
to her softly, “we know nothing about her! She could be some kind
of pervert!”</P><P>Shizuru bit back a
chuckle as she thought, 'I'm a cosplay fetishist, lesbian and I love
younger women. And soon you'll know exactly what kind of pervert I
am.'</P><P>“It's a good offer,”
Mai murmured back, “and we both know we need the rooms, Natsuki.”</P><P>Natsuki bit back a 
sigh,
they did need the room and there really looked like no other offers
coming. 'So why am I so hesitant?' she thought. Shaking her head she
looked up to meet Shizuru's warm eyes as she said, “All right, I'll
give it a try. But if I don't like it, I'm leaving!”</P><P>“You won't regret it,”
Shizuru smiled at them as she got up, using the angle to take a peek
down their bras and get a good look at their breasts. “Come on,
let's find you some rooms,” she added, making a mental note to pick
a room with good camera angles to watch them getting dressed or going
to bed.</P><P>“I doubt that,”
Natsuki sighed as they followed her out.</P>
