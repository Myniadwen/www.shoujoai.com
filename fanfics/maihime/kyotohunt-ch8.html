<h1>The Kyoto Hunt (part 8 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/asinistre.html">Ange Sinistre</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/kyotohunt-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>&quot;Anguish&quot;

The brawl in the main facility of the Searrs complex was still well 
underway. Haruka had since run out of ammunition and was now using 
hand-to-hand combat to give Akane assistance in her fight against Topaz. 
The HiME swung her tonfas at Topaz&#39;s head and neck, but neither managed 
to make contact. The brunette Otome dropped down and out of the way 
before leaping back up to land a punch to Akane&#39;s rib cage. The officer 
wheezed as she tried to gain air. Luckily, Haruka was buying her time. 
Upset that her assistant had been beaten, Haruka returned fire by 
rushing forward and grabbing hold of Topaz&#39;s wrist. The blonde quickly 
spun, complete with a battle cry, and attempted to twist Topaz&#39;s arm 
behind her back, hoping to break it. Topaz responded by curving her own 
body, escaping from the hold.

Across the way, Midori was busy swinging her axe at Crystal, who was 
expertly dodging out of the way. The Otome was having a difficult time 
finding the right moment to fire her weapon. Midori was quick and her 
own weapon was rather slow. She pumped her shotgun once, leveled it, and 
pulled the trigger. With a shriek, Midori dove to the far side of the 
hall, leaving the ice shards from the shotgun to embed themselves within 
one of the cell doors. Cursing her luck, she went back on defense as the 
redheaded archaeologist stormed back her way, axe at the ready.

Lapis and Akira had fought once before, of course, and Lapis now knew to 
resort to leaving her weapon de-materialized. It was easier to deal with 
the ninja at close range. The bow needed ample space to truly be 
effective. The two were in fighting stances, Akira holding a dagger in 
her hands, and they circled around each other, waiting for a moment to 
strike. It nearly came, but Lapis&#39; potential assault was interrupted by 
Onyx.

Her voice came through the gem on her earlobe. &quot;Ruby is engaged with the 
other HiME. They are attempting to escape. Cut them off and give her 
full support. I will assist.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Lapis replied, and trusted that all the other Otome had 
heard the message as well. She backed away from Akira and pointed 
towards the exit. &quot;Move!&quot;

Crystal and Topaz rammed themselves into Midori and Haruka respectively, 
shoving their way through and breaking for the exit. Lapis followed at 
top speed, and all sprinted out the door and into the night. The 
partially dazed HiME who had been hit paused and looked after them. 
Midori could have sworn she saw some kind of faint glow in the distance 
out in the night air. She turned back to the others and shrugged. Well, 
what else were they to do? The main objective was to rescue Akane and 
Haruka, and that had been done. Fighting the Otome was a secondary 
objective. But, hey, it was her job as the leader to make decisions.

And Midori always chose to attack! &quot;Don&#39;t let them get away. Let&#39;s go!&quot;

- - -

Natsuki, Shizuru and Mikoto were running as fast as their legs would 
take them. They ascended out the bunker as quickly as they could, that 
hovering doppelganger just behind them. Once they had reached the ground 
outside, they quickly spread out and held their weaponry in their hands 
with death grips, waiting to spring on the Otome the moment she exited 
the bunker. They held their breath as the glow from her fiery Elements 
grew closer, the doorway of the bunker entrance lit up with the flames. 
Ruby strolled out as if she was taking a nice afternoon walk, a halo of 
fire surrounding her entire body. A small smile was on her face, though 
it was faint and barely noticeable.

From behind the bunker entrance came three Searrs agents, as if they 
would do any good, to assist while the other Otome headed to the area to 
help. One held a gun straight at Mikoto, who held up her sword to try 
and block whatever shots came her way. Luckily, she did not have to risk 
it. Quick drawing a revolver, Natsuki fired on him, taking him down in 
one powerful hit. Quickly acting, she drew the hammer back and fired 
once more, leaving a gaping hole in the second agent&#39;s chest.

A bullet raced right by Shizuru&#39;s startled head, and Natsuki&#39;s gaze 
instantly drifted to a sniper situated on the roof of a nearby building. 
The last ground agent running towards them, she fired on him with one of 
her revolvers, hitting right between the eyes, and then lined up a shot 
directed at the sniper. Her barrel lined right up with the sniper who 
ducked behind a structure of some kind on the rooftop. Natsuki squinted, 
seeing part of his arm. She fired, hitting it with amazing accuracy, and 
fired a second time to finish him off after he fell back into her proper 
sight.

Her right gun empty, she opened it up and let the bullet casing fall to 
the ground with a distinct clatter. Flipping it shut, she holstered it 
and resorted to using the other one. She didn&#39;t have time to reload. She 
hissed towards Ruby. &quot;Tell me where the Emulator is, or we&#39;ll just have 
to kill off all of you to disconnect it.&quot;

Ruby said nothing. Instead, Natsuki heard footsteps behind her, and she 
spun around to see Onyx standing there, her pole-arm in her hands. The 
redheaded leader of the Otome did not look pleased, to say the least. 
Pointing her pole-arm at Natsuki she said, &quot;Lay down your arms.&quot;

&quot;Onyx!&quot; Lapis called, and the three Otome who had been fighting in the 
prison section ran up on either side of their leader, falling into 
battle stance. &quot;We miss anything?&quot;

&quot;Nothing terribly interesting,&quot; Onyx replied coolly. &quot;The other HiME?&quot;

&quot;Get back here!&quot; Midori&#39;s voice could be heard in the distance, and the 
redhead was running after them with her axe held in the air.

Lapis sighed and looked back to her leader. &quot;They managed to get the 
bait free, and as you can see, they&#39;re in pursuit at the moment.&quot;

Midori and her team fell in behind the main group of Otome, leaving the 
entire group in a chaotic mess. Technically, four of the Columns were 
surrounded, which gave the HiME an advantage. Midori looked over to 
Natsuki and nodded, the other woman seeming to understand her intention. 
Shizuru, Natsuki and Mikoto ran straight at the four, ignoring Ruby, as 
Midori&#39;s team rushed in as well. The four Columns in the center of the 
mess scrambled and dealt with strikes coming from every direction. Onyx 
held up her axe to block both Midori and Shizuru&#39;s weapons at once, 
starting a battle of pole weapons.

Ruby, however, did not seem keen on being ignored. As she saw Crystal 
take a shot at both Akira and Mikoto, both of them dodging, Ruby ignited 
her Elements again, and rose into the air. The scene below looked like a 
true war, each side taking shots at each other while warriors flung 
their enemies over their shoulders. As Akira sent a flying kick towards 
Crystal, and as Haruka was punched in the face by Topaz, Ruby had an 
overwhelming desire to put a stop to all of it. She started to summon up 
a wall of flame from her unique vantage point.

&quot;Holy fire of Mai, who is that?&quot; Midori asked, distracted for just a 
moment.

Natsuki fired a shot at Lapis, who returned the gesture. After dodging, 
the biker replied. &quot;That&#39;s the last one.&quot;

Mikoto stopped her charge on Lapis and skidded to a halt, immediately 
changing directions as she noticed Ruby take flight. Overcome with her 
desire to avenge Mai&#39;s loss of power, she abruptly leapt into the air, 
her claymore raised above her head. She didn&#39;t have proper height due to 
her lack of HiME enhancing powers, but it was enough. She arched towards 
the orange-armored woman, but found herself on the ground once more, a 
pain in her back as she landed on a rock. A flame shield that Ruby had 
formed was dissipated a moment later.

The dark haired Otome shook her finger. &quot;That wasn&#39;t nice, Minagi-san.&quot;

Mikoto was flung like a rag doll as a fireball connected with her 
already injured body, and she landed about ten feet away after the 
flames dissolved. Her shirt was blackened by the heat, her flesh 
receiving minor burns. Her claymore landed several feet away, the blade 
impaling the ground. She struggled to her feet as several of the others 
turned their attention to the flying devil above, seeing her as a 
genuine threat. Akira rushed over and pulled Mikoto up.

&quot;You okay?&quot; The ninja asked.

When Mikoto nodded, Akira responded to Ruby by flinging one of her final 
shuriken at her, and was disappointed to see it deflected by a flame 
shield. With a grunt of frustration, Akira rushed forward after Ruby 
lowered herself down, striking out with her dagger. Ruby flew out of the 
way and flung another fireball at her. Like Mikoto moments before, Akira 
flew back and landed against the ground roughly. With both of them 
injured, most of the HiME turned their attention to Ruby.

The other Otome dealt with the few who remained while Natsuki, Midori 
and Akira began to charge at once. Two shots were fired by Natsuki, at 
which point she ran out of ammunition. Ruby blocked both, but as Midori 
and Akira leapt at her, she realized she needed more power. Smirking, 
confident that she was far more advanced than any powerless HiME, she 
drew up a large wall of fire and sent it rushing towards the attackers. 
Midori and Akira fell back and howled in pain, while Natsuki held her 
ground and looked away as the flames raced by.

As a side effect, Ruby not having looked at what she was doing, Crystal 
and Lapis found themselves knocked over as well. They scrambled to get 
up as Ruby continued her assault, flinging flames in every direction. 
Even Onyx found herself ducking out of the way. In the chaos, they heard 
Natsuki issue an order to all of the HiME at once.

&quot;Retreat!&quot;

Ruby followed behind initially, but Onyx, a small burn on her face, 
waved her back. &quot;Ruby, stop! Watch what you&#39;re doing, dammit!&quot;

As if the aggressive Otome was blind to anyone except for the enemies in 
front of her, she flew by, the flame trail behind her forcing Onyx and 
Lapis to leap out of the way yet again. The HiME escaped into the 
forests surrounding the Searrs complex, and Ruby began to fling trails 
of flame into the trees, setting them ablaze and leaving the HiME to run 
through a dangerous inferno. They scattered, heading back for their 
escape vehicles as both Onyx and Lapis pinned Ruby to the ground to get 
her to listen to reason.

Ruby watched the fire she had created, grunting as she stretched her arm 
out towards the direction in which the HiME were fleeing. But her two 
commanding officers finally won, and she relented, resting her head on 
the ground.

- - -

&quot;What in god&#39;s name happened to you?&quot; The Doctor was furious. Ruby had 
seen him angry at her on several occasions, but she fixed her gaze at 
the floor as he screamed. &quot;Are you so batshit crazy that you&#39;re 
attacking your own teammates now? I knew we shouldn&#39;t have sent you out. 
You&#39;re such a... if you don&#39;t improve, I&#39;m dropping you from the unit 
and labeling you an official failure. Do you understand, Morgana?&quot;

The dark haired fire adept winced and gritted her teeth. She&#39;d heard it 
over and over and over again. You&#39;re a failure. We gave you too much 
power. You don&#39;t have the capacity to handle what Tokiha could, and you 
never will. You&#39;re inferior to the Otome and to the HiME in every way 
possible. She heard it so many goddamn times she wanted to rip off his 
jaw. She said nothing at first, gripping the sides of her chair with all 
her strength, her nails biting into the wood. The Doctor stood and 
exited the room, slamming the door. From the other side, she could hear 
his still livid voice.

&quot;This is the last time we use foreign Heirs!&quot; With that, he referred to 
descendants of the original HiME that had stood a chance of inheriting 
the title during the Carnival. The Otome were all Heirs, but none of 
them were chosen. That honor, of course, had gone to their current 
enemies.

After he had left them, Ruby&#39;s hazel eyes trailed up to the other person 
left in the room. Onyx, who had been leaning against the wall, remaining 
deathly silent during the entire exchange. She was their prized warrior, 
perfect in every way. Even still, she seemed to tolerate Ruby&#39;s 
inexperience and unpredictability, looking after her when times were 
rough. This time, however, Onyx merely stared at her.

With no natives of Japan in the room, Ruby allowed herself to slip back 
into her native tongue. She held up her arms, looking rather like a 
child as her eyes began to water. &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry. I don&#39;t know what 
happened. I didn&#39;t mean to. I just... I just got carried away. Please, 
will you forgive me, Allie?&quot;

Ruby remained still for several long moments, hoping for some kind of 
answer that never would come. A hand on her weak facial burn, Onyx 
kicked herself off the wall and with restrained frustration, she opened 
the door without a word and left her to rejoin Celeste, Sonia and Eva. 
She saw them briefly before the door was shut again, Allison turning 
around only for a moment to give her a parting glance, and she was left 
to suffer in the brig alone.

She wept, her hands pressed to her face, hoping to stop the tears from 
falling.

Their base of operations unofficially became Mai&#39;s place. It was closer 
than Shizuru&#39;s. It was about midnight when their vehicles came to a halt 
outside, and they marched up the stairs leading to her apartment, 
leaving their weapons in the vehicles. Mikoto was wrapped in Midori&#39;s 
coat to prevent anyone from seeing her scorched shirt or rousing 
suspicion. Mai opened the door moments after Akira knocked, and widened 
her eyes slightly. She stepped to the side, allowing them to enter. They 
each took a spot on the floor, revealing their various wounds and 
injuries. Not long after receiving a call, another woman trained a bit 
in healthcare showed up.

Shuffling her feet out of nervousness, Shiho greeted Mai, and then 
proceeded to help the redhead address some of the problems at hand. 
First up was Mikoto, who was given a spare shirt of Mai&#39;s to wear. She 
seemed to have the worst injuries out of all of them. In the meantime, 
Shizuru handed her flash drive to Yukino, who had been monitoring the 
action from the computer and the JSDF satellite network. Shizuru, Haruka 
and Midori stood behind the hacker as the files were accessed.

&quot;Well, what&#39;s on there?&quot; Haruka asked.

Yukino put a hand to her mouth in surprise. &quot;Oh, my! This is... this 
looks like an entire database of people with HiME blood, and all past 
participants. This goes back for several Carnivals. The oldest date here 
is from the time of Rome. There are family lines going back for 
everyone, with theoretical ties to the very first HiME.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s it say about me?&quot; Midori demanded, shoving her face closer to 
the screen as she got a big grin on her face.

Yukino looked back, briefly, and then pointed to the screen. &quot;&#39;Sugiura 
Midori &#150; Gakutenou. Full Key Separation on 2009-May-14, at 11:34 PM.&#39; 
There&#39;s also lineage for you. You&#39;re... well, as expected, descendant 
from the original Asian HiME, apparently. A list of older Gakutenou 
users... it goes in different directions.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s a Full Key Separation?&quot; Midori inquired as Yukino browsed 
through a list of names. &quot;Just... having your Key go up in green 
sparkles?&quot;

Yukino ran a search. &quot;There&#39;s a small glossary, fortunately. The files 
states that a Full Key Separation is &#39;the death of a HiME Key, rendering 
the HiME unable to summon an Element or Child and permanently inhibiting 
their mental state so that they are gripped with despair and left 
emotionally crippled.&#39; Which is what happened to us when we lost our 
Keys, certainly. It goes on to say the bond between a HiME and a Key is 
artificially enhanced during the Carnival. I suppose that&#39;s true as 
well. We did get a bit clingy, didn&#39;t we?&quot;

Haruka pointed to an entry. &quot;Aoyama Reiko. Partial Key Separation on 
1708-July-17. Razed the village of Daishima. Killed by Kazahana Mashiro 
on 1708-July-28. Partial Key Separation? Is there an entry for that?&quot;

Yukino nodded. &quot;A Partial Key Separation is listed, yes, along with a 
list of people who were victim of it. Aoyama, Kitamura, at least three 
from the European Carnival circa 800 AD, and... hmm. The definition 
states that it&#39;s, &#39;the rejection of the HiME on the part of the Key, 
usually in the form of emotional abandonment. In this scenario, a HiME 
can still summon weapons, as the Key is alive, but is left in the same 
permanent hopeless state as if they had endured a Full Key Separation, 
and will often run on base emotions for the rest of the Carnival, until 
they are exterminated by a fully functioning HiME.&#39;&quot;

Shizuru tightened her jaw, and scanned the list. Lo and behold, at the 
bottom, her name was listed right under Shiho&#39;s. She softly spoke. 
&quot;Fujino Shizuru &#150; Kiyohime. Partial Key Separation on 2009-May-14, at 
8:46 PM. Razed First District region. Full Key Separation and death on 
2009-May-16. Killed by Kuga Natsuki.&quot;

Haruka managed a laugh after a moment of tense nervousness. &quot;Well, that 
explains the sudden snap, I guess. At least you have a clinical term for 
it all.&quot;

&quot;Seems fairly common,&quot; Yukino interrupted, before any kind of melodrama 
could occur. &quot;There&#39;s been at least one in every Carnival. There were a 
total of five from the Carnival in Europe circa 800 AD, apparently. 
I&#39;ll... see if I can&#39;t find something on the Otome now.&quot;

The group fell silent again. Haruka, Yukino and Nao had somewhat 
forgiven Shizuru for her actions, but still held very rightful grudges. 
Shizuru found her eyes drifting to the floor, mildly comforted by the 
fact that she was not some freak of nature after all, and that it had 
happened to warrior maidens before her. Her gaze drifted up to Natsuki, 
who was in the process of getting a bandage applied to a minor burn 
wound on her arm. They locked gazes for a brief moment, Natsuki&#39;s eyes 
becoming concerned after seeing Shizuru&#39;s glum expression. The Kyoto 
woman smiled after a moment to alleviate the worry. Before Natsuki could 
venture over, Yukino piped up again.

&quot;There&#39;s a lot of HiME descendants who work for Searrs. I mean... a lot. 
Most of the top executives seem to be descendants of the HiME. The code 
names for the Otome aren&#39;t listed, so I&#39;m not sure which ones are them. 
Pictures aren&#39;t posted. Or if they are, I can&#39;t really access them. I&#39;m 
currently tracing us back.&quot; Yukino tapped her hand on the mouse while 
the command was processing. &quot;Most of us are just descended from that 
original Asian HiME from the First Carnival, and it lists what parent 
had the gene.&quot;

Haruka dropped her jaw and pointed to the screen. &quot;Click it!&quot;

Yukino clicked on Haruka&#39;s name. &quot;Haruka-chan, your father had the gene! 
You must just not have been selected by the Obsidian Lord. Ah, it says 
you&#39;re a descendant of a certain Valerie Alcourt, who fought in the 
Hundred Years&#39; War Carnival. Haruka-chan, you never told me you were 
part European.&quot;

The blonde crossed her arms. &quot;My grandfather was from England. I had the 
lineage, then? And the Obsidian Lord didn&#39;t choose me? How rude! 
Clearly, that machine was fool and deserved to be destroyed. Wait, how&#39;d 
my ancestor do in the Carnival?&quot;

&quot;Ara, it says she was decapitated,&quot; Shizuru informed after reading, &quot;by 
the Kiyohime user, at that.&quot;

&quot;Oh, bull! It does not say that! Move, let me read!&quot; Haruka dropped her 
face near the glass, and took in the words. &quot;Oh, dammit, no way. Fujino, 
don&#39;t you say a thing.&quot;

By this time, most everyone was listening, the rest of the room having 
gone silent. Natsuki had wandered over after her wound was cleaned up, 
crossing her arms and coming to rest next to Shizuru. Yukino continued 
on. &quot;The others who are from different lines are Shizuru, on her 
mother&#39;s side, Natsuki, on her father&#39;s side, and Alyssa-chan, on her 
father&#39;s side as well.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you don&#39;t look very Japanese,&quot; Midori said to Shizuru, who 
shrugged.

Natsuki knew very little about the maternal side of Shizuru&#39;s family, as 
she seldom talked about it. It was a rather sore subject. Her aunt was 
the only remaining member of that line, and while Natsuki knew her, that 
was the extent of her involvement with Shizuru&#39;s family. The Kyoto woman 
had essentially grown up an orphan. Perhaps that was why they got along. 
Shizuru managed to smile and explained.

&quot;My mother and her family was from Moscow. My father was from Kyoto, 
which explains my mixed complexion.&quot;

Yukino nodded along. &quot;Milena Dragunov was her name, then?&quot;

Haruka huffed. &quot;I knew it. She&#39;s a Commie. That explains all that lazy 
and twitchy behavior, expecting everyone else to do her work for her and 
still get recognition for it.&quot;

&quot;Haruka, shut the hell up,&quot; Natsuki warned. Haruka glared, but seemed to 
comply for now.

Yukino coughed and changed subjects yet again, to avoid more tension. 
She clicked on another name. &quot;Alyssa-chan is descended from Alicia 
Smith, who was also in the Hundred Years&#39; War Carnival. Smith... ah, 
huh, I guess her father was that creepy blonde guy?&quot;

&quot;What about you, Natsuki? Was one of your parents a foreigner?&quot; Midori 
asked. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have guessed from your looks, though.&quot;

Natsuki was silent, shrugging and looking away. If Shizuru&#39;s past was a 
sore subject, her own was worse. Natsuki knew nothing about her father&#39;s 
side of the family, or who he even was. He had never been a part of her 
life. &quot;You tell me. I don&#39;t know. What&#39;s it say?&quot;

&quot;Never mind.&quot; Yukino looked away quickly, knowing that Natsuki&#39;s 
reaction would be bad.

Silence followed, until Midori broke it in her own way. &quot;What, is she 
Darth Vader&#39;s daughter? Come on, stop being all dramatic.&quot;

Seeing Natsuki&#39;s stern gaze, as well as the interested expressions from 
the people around her, Yukino realized that there was no real way around 
it. She certainly had a right to know. She just had to brace herself for 
a bad reaction. With a sigh, Yukino spoke. &quot;You&#39;re a descendant of 
Alicia Smith as well, Natsuki.&quot;

A pause. Midori again. &quot;Natsuki&#39;s a honky? No way. She doesn&#39;t even look 
it.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t mean, I...&quot;

&quot;Alyssa-chan is your sister,&quot; Yukino said bluntly. Green eyes widened to 
dangerous levels. &quot;Different mothers explain the different looks. Dr. 
Kuga isn&#39;t listed, so you couldn&#39;t have gotten the HiME blood from her, 
so... I...&quot;

A tense jaw and a hostile expression set fear into Yukino. It looked 
like Natsuki was almost willing to punch one of them. She opened her 
mouth, but said nothing at first, only tightening her fist in the air 
and sharply pivoting around towards the door. She grabbed her keys from 
a table nearby and pulled on her riding jacket once more. &quot;I have to 
go.&quot;

&quot;Natsuk&#151;&quot; Shizuru began to call, but was cut off.

&quot;I said I have to go.&quot;

Shizuru knew better than to argue with that tone, and decided that if 
Natsuki needed alone time, that was fine. It was her thing, driving off 
into the night like that. She marched out the door in an instant and a 
moment late, the revving of a bike engine could be heard below. Shizuru 
and Mai went to the window and watched as the biker rocketed down the 
street at full speed. That was her form of therapy. Between her and the 
road, she could sort out her issues with enough time. However, the 
sinking feeling in Shizuru&#39;s stomach did nothing for her as she found 
herself reminded of the Carnival and the day before her &#39;Partial Key 
Separation,&#39; as it was called, apparently.

She picked up her coat and looked to Mai. &quot;I should go home. If for some 
reason she comes back here, tell her I have her things?&quot;

Mai nodded. &quot;Of course. Drive safely, kaichou-sama.&quot;

Shizuru nodded and soon left after waving farewell to everyone else, and 
when the door closed behind her, some of the HiME sighed and looked over 
to Yukino. Midori patted her on the back. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. Now, 
can we ruin any other lives tonight?&quot;

&quot;Sensei!&quot; Mai chastised.

The teacher shrugged and smiled innocently. Yukino turned back and 
pointed to a list of names she had been making. &quot;Allison Rosenkrantz, 
Sonia Valencourt, Celeste Richardson, Morgana Loran, Eva Olsson, and 
Leanne Young seem to be within the age range of the Otome. Perhaps 
that&#39;s them, if they&#39;re related. Well, five of the six, anyway. I don&#39;t 
know. It&#39;s a place to start.&quot;

&quot;Good enough for me,&quot; Mai said.

Mikoto looked sadly at her. Mai furrowed her brows. She had been getting 
those kind of looks all night. It was the feral child who finally broke 
the last part of tension in the room, and said, &quot;Mai, I found who took 
your power away.&quot;

Mai looked to Midori, &quot;What&#39;s she talking about?&quot;

The teacher made a nervous laugh. &quot;Yeah, about that last Otome... she 
was apparently engineered by Searrs after the Carnival. She, ah, she&#39;s 
using your Elements. The twirly spinny things of fire.&quot;

Mai was silent for a long moment, not quite sure how to handle that. 
Then, she looked back up to them, her face harboring a great deal of 
anger, a look not really seen since the end of their own conflict. 
&quot;Searrs put my powers to use in their sick little game? I had put faith 
that with the destruction of the Obsidian Lord, no one would ever wield 
such powers again. I could barely handle them as it is. They just sat 
back, studied me, and then made some little clone of their own?&quot;

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Akira muttered. &quot;Except you aren&#39;t nearly as 
nuts.&quot;

&quot;I want to go next time.&quot; Everyone knew that when Mai made such a 
demand, it would take a fool to argue against it. &quot;I want to see her for 
myself.&quot;

Shiho, who had been silent most of the time, felt that it was wise to 
try and reason with her. &quot;What if she spots you? You can&#39;t fight. It&#39;s 
risky.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll wait on the edge of battle as a getaway driver,&quot; Mai declared. 
&quot;You all should plan a final assault to get that Emulator down once and 
for all, now that you know that it must be in the one remaining 
facility. We should hit it soon, before they move it. We&#39;ll get Miyu in 
to help in a full scale assault. Aim to take it down within one week.&quot;

The tone had been more serious than Natsuki&#39;s usual commanding voice. 
Midori shivered, &quot;That&#39;s that old red ranger attitude I like to hear 
from you.&quot;

- - -

As Natsuki rode, she realized she needed to learn how to think moving at 
a speed slower than eighty miles per hour. She did this too often, and 
it did nothing for the amount of money she spent on gas. She kept trying 
to avoid thinking of the subject she&#39;d gone riding to think about. 
Anything to elevate her mind to a state other than &#39;pit of despair.&#39; She 
growled lightly as she rounded a corner. That... that cold and 
emotionless Searrs asshole had violated her mother and some other poor 
woman just so he could hopefully gain a HiME of his own to use in his 
grand plot. Whatever the hell that was. To rule the world, according to 
what Nao had recorded on her phone.

She took another turn and scoffed. Then again, knowing full well that 
her mother had intended to sell her to the Foundation, it made sense 
that her mother was in on it as well. The good Dr. Kuga probably just 
fled and held a young Natsuki ransom in exchange for their money. Well, 
a lot of good that did her. Wonderful. She was the offspring of two 
greedy and self-centered Searrs officers. And then Alyssa! He had just 
sat by and watched, probably making little scientific notes, as his two 
daughters nearly killed one another!

Good god, she&#39;d nearly killed her own sister and didn&#39;t know it. At the 
mere thought of the young blonde girl, her own problems fell to the 
wayside. Alyssa was the only one of them that had the right to actually 
complain. Natsuki had gotten off easy. Alyssa had been held there and 
treated like a test subject, a victim of their experiments. She had been 
nothing more than a tool to them. Her, their, father had just sat 
through it all as if it were nothing. No compassion, no caring, not a 
hint of emotion.

Natsuki turned down another street. She had found herself in a certain 
area of Kyoto where she was thinking of moving, in which Shizuru&#39;s aunt 
happened to live. It was late, but the good natured Russian was usually 
up until the ungodly hours of the morning anyway. Sakomizu was too far 
away to be of any use to her, and for some reason, she toyed with the 
idea of meeting with her other parental figure. She parked her bike and 
marched down the sidewalk towards Ms. Dragunov&#39;s house. The lights were 
indeed on.

On the way, however, she spotted someone else walking on the street. A 
certain platinum haired guardian of a certain blonde. Miyu stopped and 
stared at Natsuki. &quot;Kuga-san, it is late. You shouldn&#39;t be driving.&quot;

Natsuki was silent for several long moments. &quot;Where&#39;s Alyssa?&quot;

Asleep, at home. She is to be in bed by nine.&quot; Miyu stared at a very 
silent and obviously disturbed biker, and continued. &quot;Come with me. I 
will make you something to drink. It is cold out here.&quot;

Natsuki followed without argument, which alerted Miyu further. Natsuki 
did not usually accept such invitations. The android opened the door to 
her home, a few houses down, and stepped inside, leading Natsuki to the 
kitchen. She set herself to making green tea, no doubt something Natsuki 
was accustomed to having. The biker, however, fixed her gaze on the 
stairs, clearly not interested. Miyu turned to her as the water began to 
heat, and made a correct assumption.

&quot;Do you know?&quot; Miyu inquired.

Natsuki was snapped out of her reverie. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see a logical reason why you would be here so late, and be so 
fixated on Alyssa, if you hadn&#39;t heard something. Do you know?&quot; Miyu 
asked again, taking the kettle off the stove.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Natsuki slowly nodded. She blinked and then whirled her head up 
to stare at Miyu. &quot;You know? Why didn&#39;t you stop us in the Carnival, 
then? You could have told me right then and there!&quot;

&quot;You both didn&#39;t need to know. It was not a prime directive,&quot; Miyu said 
calmly. &quot;My mission was only to defend her. You were not an objective of 
mine.&quot;

Natsuki narrowed her eyes. &quot;What do you mean, &#39;both of us didn&#39;t need to 
know?&#39; You&#39;re saying she already knows?&quot;

&quot;She was briefed before the Carnival.&quot; Miyu put down a cup of tea. 
&quot;Smith and the Chief told her. She was trained not to pay any attention 
to the blood relation. Never the less, she did the most research on you 
out of all of them. More so than she did for Mai. Perhaps that was her 
undoing in the end, or at least part of it. Yes, she knows. She&#39;s known 
since then.&quot;

She felt like crying, if just for a moment. So, when she had called 
Natsuki onee-sama, it had not just been a mere gesture. She actually 
meant it in its more literal sense, and Natsuki had thought nothing of 
it. Without warning, she stood from the stool she had been offered and 
headed upstairs, and Miyu merely watched. Her arms crossed, Natsuki 
silently wandered to a partially open door and peeked inside. The blonde 
girl was sleeping soundly. Well, in theory. Natsuki only saw the back of 
her head.

She stood there for several minutes, just watching. She sighed. She was 
a loner by nature, of course, but had inwardly kind of wanted a stable 
family. Or at least a living relative. Now that she had one, she wasn&#39;t 
sure what to do. Damn, and she had made no effort to befriend her over 
the years, save for just recently. She thought herself an ass for that 
now. She shook her head and turned back down the stairs. It was a 
mistake coming here so late at night. She marched down the stairs, 
grabbed the offered tea from Miyu, and chugged it.

&quot;I need to go. Thank you.&quot; Natsuki moved towards the door, and the robot 
seemed content with letting her do as she pleased. This was not her area 
of expertise. She knew to stay back and out of the way.

As Natsuki reached for the door handle, she was stopped by a light and 
melodic voice. &quot;Natsuki onee-sama?&quot;

She froze, a shocked expression on her face as she let go of the handle 
and turned around. Standing on the top stair was Alyssa, her golden hair 
disheveled and her eyes still slightly weary from her interruption. She 
must have heard their voices or sensed Natsuki&#39;s movement upstairs. 
Natsuki swallowed a dry throat but could think of nothing to say. The 
two females simply stared at each other for several moment. &quot;Y-yeah. Hi. 
I didn&#39;t mean to wake you. Sorry. I was just leaving.&quot;

A sign of her distress was always her short and choppy language. Alyssa 
descended down two stair and said, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; she replied.

&quot;Liar.&quot; It didn&#39;t take a genius to figure it out, or for that matter, 
why she was here. Showing wisdom beyond her years, and already having 
eavesdropped on half of the conversation, she spoke in a clear and adult 
voice. &quot;Natsuki, I know you&#39;ve had more shocks in your lifetime than 
anyone should have to deal with, and I&#39;m sorry you only found out now, 
apparently. I had always meant to tell you. I had always wanted a 
sister. I didn&#39;t like to be alone when I was little. I just never found 
the courage to speak up. Perhaps it was the scars from the Carnival that 
held me back &#150; being worried that would be bitter about everything that 
happened &#150; or it was because you still felt like a stranger that I 
didn&#39;t want to anger. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Natsuki slowly shook her head, although she was somewhat surprised that 
the shy girl had been so straightforward. &quot;Anything that happened during 
the Carnival, caused by anyone, was something I forgave a long time ago. 
You don&#39;t have to worry about that.&quot;

Alyssa shifted her weight, unsure of what she should say. &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry you grew up alone,&quot; Natsuki mumbled, trying her best. &quot;It 
should have been me in your position.&quot;

&quot;Fate and chance funny like that,&quot; Alyssa replied. &quot;No, it should not 
have been. Your place was with the HiME. I had my roll, and you had 
yours. Everything worked out all right in the end. You all gave us a 
chance to start over.&quot;

Natsuki&#39;s chest suddenly felt tight. She needed to go home. &quot;You should 
get back to bed. It&#39;s late. I have to go.&quot;

She opened the door, and before closing it, Alyssa shouted back, &quot;You 
still owe me a decent bike ride.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Natsuki shut the door, a small smile on her lips. It could 
work.

One lantern was lit outside the house as Natsuki walked towards her 
home, hands gripped on her jacket. She gently stepped up the stairs, the 
night&#39;s news still weighing heavily on her mind. In all honesty, her 
parentage did not matter. Her mother, her father &#150; they did not matter. 
They were not a part of her life, and had not been for years. On the 
ride home, she had come to that conclusion. The people who actually 
mattered were the ones she was around every day, or had the chance to be 
around every day. Alyssa, now that she knew her relation to her, her 
friends, Shizuru... they were the only ones that counted.

But still...

She slid open the door at around two in the morning, and was greeted by 
a soft glow from the living area. Shizuru sat on her ankles, reading a 
book. Red eyes looked up to meet Natsuki&#39;s, and the brunette slowly 
stood. Natsuki, cold and fatigued beyond believe, allowed the other 
woman to wrap a small blanket around her that had previously been folded 
neatly on the floor. Shizuru pulled the woman into an embrace 
afterwards, and not willing to fight about it, Natsuki sank into it.

Neither said a word.

Two days later, Midori stopped by the hospital before work. She walked 
her way up to the proper floor and signed all necessary paperwork. Nao, 
dressed back in her cleaned street clothes, calmly walked out of her 
room, a bag of her belongings in her hand. The pair headed back down the 
stairs and out to Midori&#39;s truck without more than a polite greeting 
exchange. Nao slid into the passenger&#39;s seat and Midori began to drive 
away, thank the heavens above. Any longer in that place and Nao would 
have busted herself out.

It took about ten minutes of driving before Midori realized she didn&#39;t 
know where the hell Nao lived. &quot;Hey, Nao, where are we going?&quot;

&quot;Drop me on the corner. I can take it from here.&quot; The reply was curt and 
to the point.

Midori shook a finger. &quot;Oh, no you don&#39;t. I want to see where you&#39;re 
staying. You aren&#39;t at a dorm anymore, and you certainly don&#39;t have 
funds for an apartment of your own, so... you understand that your 
ex-teacher is a little worried about your living conditions.&quot;

Nao scoffed. &quot;Oh, please. Drop me off.&quot;

Midori glared. Nao glared. They both glared for another thirty seconds 
until the honking of a horn reminded Midori that she had to actually 
watch where she was driving. Damn, she was starting to act like Youko, 
the crazy she-devil. Nao said nothing for several long minutes before 
she replied and said, &quot;I crash at friends&#39; places for a while. Or 
hotels, if I have the cash at the time. I make a bit here and there, 
working as a vigilante. People give me money to rough up assholes who 
deserve it.&quot;

&quot;So, you&#39;re staying at my place, then? Oh, that&#39;s fine, I know right 
where it is.&quot; Midori took a sharp corner and headed back to her own 
place before Nao could protest.

Well, she did, but that was after Midori started to head in that 
direction. &quot;Sensei, I don&#39;t want to stay with you, you&#39;re a creepy old 
lecher who pretends to be a teenager.&quot;

&quot;I pretend I&#39;m twenty-one now, thank you.&quot;

Nao sighed. &quot;I&#39;ll be fine, Sugiura.&quot;

&quot;Yes, you will,&quot; Midori replied, smiling, adding in, &quot;at my apartment.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t pay you.&quot; Nao crossed her arms and looked out the window.

&quot;That&#39;s fine. When you enroll back in university, you can find your way 
back to your old dorm. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll smooth everything over with the 
teachers and administration. What? What&#39;s that? &#39;Thank you, Midori, you 
super-awesome and kickass crusader of justice?&#39; Don&#39;t worry, Nao, think 
nothing of it.&quot;

Nao hissed in frustration. &quot;Fine, dammit, I give up.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s my girl.&quot; Midori turned back to her for a moment. &quot;You&#39;re lucky, 
Nao. You get to stay at my place and you get better right before the 
endgame! You&#39;re back for the best part. Now it&#39;s just kicking ass and 
taking names, I&#39;ll bet. Mai seems to be back in charge, too. She&#39;s 
already got a mission lined up for you, me and Miyu.&quot;

&quot;Really now?&quot; Nao said, suddenly feeling a hundred times sweeter now 
that she knew she could get back into the fighting aspect of their 
drama. &quot;Do tell.&quot;

Midori smirked.

Next Episode: The HiME, and Miyu, take an aggressive stance with the 
Otome and Searrs, calling them out to fight themselves after assaulting 
a facility under their control. United together, they make efforts to 
pin down the exact location of the Emulator so that they can end the 
fight once and for all. A sick revelation is made about the nature of 
the Emulator and the source of the Gems, however, putting the HiME at 
odds with each other on how to handle it. Episode 9, &quot;Fury,&quot; coming 
soon.

Author note: Alyssa and Natsuki being sisters is a manga thing that I 
learned later on, but to be honest, I had hypothesized that Smith had 
been Natsuki&#39;s father and that the two girls were related in that 
manner. So I had to work it in. That and a scene with the Otome to help 
flesh them out. In addition, I may jump on the ShizNat Emo bandwagon and 
make a quick prequel to the Kyoto Hunt about how they resolve their 
issues after the Carnival and come together as they are here, since 
their relationship is rather superficial in this fic given how I&#39;ve 
already put them together for sanity&#39;s sake. Well, okay, it wouldn&#39;t all 
be emo. But you know. </pre>
