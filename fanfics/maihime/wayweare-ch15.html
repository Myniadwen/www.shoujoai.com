<p>Circumstances</p>

There he was, right in  front of me. There was no escaping now.
<p>I raced down the  highway, weaving around the fast paced traffic while making sure to  keep my eye on the cat-like Orphan that continued to hop from car top  to car top. I had been chasing the thing for…well, honestly I don’t  remember how long, I also couldn’t recall when I had first seen it,  but that didn’t matter now that I had caught up with the damn  thing.</p>
<p>I raised my element and  aimed to shoot, but right before I could pull the trigger, the  monster leapt atop a giant semi and proceeded to jump to the next  car, and unfortunately out of my sight. I cursed as I looked for any  way around the obstacle, but there seemingly was none as there were  cars close behind and in front of the truck.</p>
<p>And then an idea struck  me. I took a split second to glance over to my left, trying to judge  the distance between the bottom of the trailer and the pavement  rushing below it. I could make that. No problem. I was a HiME after  all, wasn’t I?</p>
<p>I pushed out a breath,  and tightening my grip on the handles, I braced myself and initiated  the plan.</p>
<p>I weaved to the right  to gaining some momentum before rocketing back to the left towards  the truck. At the very last moment, I shifted my weight back to the  right and felt my bike tip onto its side. Sparks flew. I could hear  the metal frame of my Ducati screaming at its contact with the black  asphalt. Just as easily, I could feel my leather suit quickly wearing  down as the rough ground ripped it to shreds. I struggled to keep  control, but I knew if I let up now, there was no way I’d be  walking away from this one. And that wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>What seemed like an  eternity was in reality mere seconds, and once I had completely slid  out from under the trailer on the other side, I immediately jerked my  body to the left with all of my strength and barely managed to pop my  motorcycle back up properly onto it’s wheels. Once again I had to  battle for control, but soon enough it was won. Back on track, I  searched for the Orphan and spotted it a few cars ahead of me.  Accelerating, I quickly made my way to the thing, materializing my  pistol in my left hand as I drove. The creature turned towards me  when it heard me approaching, it’s golden eyes glaring at me as it  let out a roar.</p>
<p>Again, I raised my gun  at the Orphan, “Gotcha now—!”</p>
<p>“You really shouldn’t  do that, Natsuki.”</p>
<p>I snapped my head over  my shoulder and my eyes widened at the sight, “SHIZURU?!”</p>
<p>“Playing with guns is  dangerous you know.”</p>
<p>“Wha?! H-How did you  get here?! On my bike…?”</p>
<p>The girl simply smiled  at me like she always did. That mocking little smile…it practically  said <em>“I’m not telling”. </em>She might as well have stuck her  tongue out at me too.</p>
<p>I turned my attention  back to the task at hand, “Bah! I’ve got to take care of this  thing.”</p>
<p>“But you could hurt  yourself,” Shizuru protested as she pulled at my arm, making my aim  waver.</p>
<p>“Stop it, Shizuru!”  I grumbled through gritted teeth as I tried to free myself from her  grasp.</p>
<p>The chestnut-haired  girl refused to let go, “I’m just trying to keep you safe!”</p>
<p>“You’re not  helping!” I yelled back.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt the  front wheel of my bike hit a rut in the road causing the thing to  jerk beneath me, and I lost my hold on the handle. The front of the  motorcycle instantly turned and fell, and Shizuru and I were violent  thrown onto the pavement.</p>
<p>The initial contact  occurred with my shoulder, and after that, I began tumbling endlessly  across the empty lanes of the highway. When I finally ceased moving,  I slowly opened my eyes and sat up. It wasn’t long before I spotted  Shizuru lying several yards away.</p>
<p>She wasn’t moving.</p>
<p>“SHIZURU!” I cried  out as I scrambled to my feet and over to her side. Kneeling beside  her, I slowly rolled my friend onto her back, “Shizuru…”</p>
<p>I was met with amused  crimson eyes, “Was Natsuki worried about me?”</p>
<p>My jaw dropped. I  couldn’t breathe.</p>
<p>I sat dumbfounded as  the girl leaned up, got to her feet, and proceeded to dust herself  off, “I told you it was dangerous. Natsuki should really be more  careful.”</p>
<p>My eye twitched and I  was immediately on my feet as well, “Wh-What?! This was all <em>YOUR</em> fault!” I shouted while pointing a finger in her face, “If you  hadn’t interfered, that Orphan would have—Hey, wait a  minute…where <em>did</em> the Orphan go? And the traffic…? And how  the hell are we not dead right now?!”</p>
<p>Taking in my  surroundings, I noticed for the first time since we had crashed that  Shizuru and I were the only ones here in the middle of the highway.  There were no cars…no animals, nothing. It was just the open road,  an orange sunset sky, and the two of us. It was oddly quiet too.</p>
<p>The Kyoto native merely  shrugged at my words, “I don’t know. This is Natsuki’s dream  after all.”</p>
<p>“Dream? Wha—“</p>
<p><em>Beep. Beep. Beep.  Beep. </em><em><strong>SMACK!</strong></em></p>
<p>Grumbling, I sat up, “I  really need to stop watching those stupid action flicks…”</p>
<p>After I had rolled out  of bed and managed to shuffle over to the bathroom, I squinted at my  disheveled-haired self. I smacked my cheeks a few times to try to  collect myself before going over to the shower and turning on the  water. Afterwards, I immediatlely began stripping out of my clothes.</p>
<p><em>That sure was a  crazy dream…I hope I didn’t eat something bad last night…that  take-out was a couple of days old, wasn’t it? Bad idea…</em></p>
<p>I unconsciously stepped  into the shower as my mental conversation continued.</p>
<p><em>I hope that wasn’t  a premonition or something…If I have déjà vu later I  swear to god I’m going to lose it…Although Shizuru miraculously  showing up on the back of my bike while I’m in the middle of  driving is a bit of a stretch…Knowing that woman, she’d find a  way though…</em></p>
<p>I had to laugh at the  outlandishness of the thought as I washed off, but afterwards I was  slightly disheartened because I knew the bizarre dream wasn’t  something I would be able to share with my friend. There were so many  things that I would have liked to talk with Shizuru about…some  serious, some just casual, but there always seemed to be a wall  blocking me from doing so…a wall that had <em>HiME</em> written all  over it.</p>
<p>I went along with the  rest of my usual morning routine before heading out the door a little  later than I had originally intended.</p>
<p><em>I can’t believe  I’m going to school on a day when I could have easily skipped...But  I did promise Shizuru that I’d come…I can’t back out now…she’d  be so disappointed…Of course she wouldn’t say that she was,  that’s just like her…I wish she’d be more honest with me  sometimes…Heh, like I really have any right to say that…</em></p>
<p>The traffic getting to  school was a little heavier than usual due to the festival, but I  eventually made it, parking in my usual place soon after arriving.  The sound of the morning crowd continued to get louder as I trekked  forward, and it wasn’t long before I was right in the middle of the  source. I had just reached into my pocket to fetch my cell phone when  the device began to vibrate in my hand.</p>
<p>Pulling it out, I  glanced at the outer display and immediately flipped it open once I  saw that it was Shizuru, “Hey, I was just about to call you. Where  do you want to meet up?”</p>
<p>I could hear her sigh  into the receiver, <em>“Kanin na, Natsuki. I’m afraid something  has come up…”</em></p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“<em>The Director just  contacted me a minute ago, she needs me to meet with some of the  suppliers for the school in her place.”</em></p>
<p>“O-Oh…”</p>
<p>“<em>I’m very sorry,  Natsuki. I—“</em></p>
<p>“No, no, don’t  worry about it. Uh, how long is the meeting going to last?”</p>
<p>“<em>I can’t be  sure, but I doubt that it will be resolved quickly.</em>”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“<em>You could still  stick around. Maybe we could walk around a bit later?” </em></p>
<p>“Eh, I don’t  know…This really isn’t my kind of environment…”</p>
<p>A pause, <em>“Yes, of  course. Another time perhaps.”</em></p>
<p>“Y-Yeah…” I  mumbled, the obvious disappointment in her voice clinching at my  heart. I grimaced.</p>
<p>The tone quickly  dispersed, “Well then, I really need to go change now, so I’ll  talk to you later, Natsuki.”</p>
<p>“Bye…”</p>
<p>Closing my cell, I let a sigh slip passed my lips, but it sounded  more like a huff than anything else. Whether I wanted to admit it or  not, I did feel a little disappointed about the news I had just  received. Having nothing else better to do, I aimlessly began to  wander around the school grounds, checking out all of the setups that  now littered the walkways.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>Why did this have to  happen? And I was supposed to spend the day relaxing with my Natsuki…</em>
<p>With no one around, I  allowed myself to visibly pout as I hastily unlocked the door to my  dorm room. Once inside, I immediately changed out of my school  uniform and into one of the kimono I had stored in my closet. What  better way to entertain the businessmen I was to speak with than to  serve them tea in the traditional style? At least it would help keep  my mind off of what I could be doing…what I <em>wanted</em> to be  doing…or I supposed it would. The tea would certainly help to calm  me down anyway.</p>
<p>Once I had finished  putting my kimono on, which would have been a long process for most  people to do by themselves, but luckily wasn’t the case for me, I  set out for the teahouse that was located on campus. Generally the  little building was used for the school clubs that focused around tea  ceremony and other traditional Japanese arts, but when it wasn’t in  use, it was sometime used for special meetings such as the one I was  about to take part in.</p>
<p>Since Kazahana-sama had called me in plenty of time before the  meeting was to take place, I had enough time to properly set up and  prepare for the wealthy visitors I would soon have to speak with.  Actually, I finished with twenty minutes to spare, so rather than  stay confined inside, I stood outside the small structure allowing  the slight breeze to play with my fixed hair and cool me off.</p>
<p><em>It certainly is a beautiful day today…perfect weather for the  anniversary celebration. It truly is a shame I’ll have to be cooped  up like this…</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t too long before my peaceful scene was disrupted by a  group of suited men approaching. I glared at them while they were  still at a distance, but soon I closed my eyes and allowed a placid  smile to grace my features. That plain smile…void of any true  emotion...true happiness, I had been able to manufacture it  precisely, perfectly, for years now…and today was no different.</p>
<p>When the group of males was close enough, I bowed politely, “Welcome.  My name is Fujino Shizuru, Seitokaichou of Fuuka Academy. Please,  right this way.”</p>
<p>Stepping aside, I watched as the men filed inside, most of them  simply nodding at me as they entered. Once they were all inside and  seated and formalities were all out of the way, I brought out my  utensils and began preparing the tea in silence, my mind failing in  our agreement to not think about a certain blue-haired beauty that I  should have been with at this very moment.</p>
<p><em>Natsuki…how I wish you were here with me rather than these old  wrinkled money hagglers…Focus, now focus. Rijichou-san is relying  on me to handle this properly so I must keep my mind on track.</em></p>
<p>“So, about supplying materials for next year…” one of the men  interrupted my thoughts.</p>
<p>Despite my previous distraction, I was right back in step, “Please,  we’re having tea right now. Business talk can wait until later.”</p>
<p>“However, we are…”</p>
<p>“The Director has put me in charge of these matters. I’ll listen  to what you need to tell me later. Ne?” I smiled, making sure to  clearly annunciate my Kyoto accent and look as cute as possible as I  innocently commanded the older man.</p>
<p>“R-right,” he managed to reply as I handed him a cup of steaming  green tea.</p>
<p><em>If I’m going to be stuck here, I might as well have a little  fun. Let’s see how long you can hold out…and how much I can make  you donate to the school, shall we?</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
It took a while to make  the loop around the school, and by the time I had made it back to the  start the horde of people had grown immensely ranging from students  to parents, even the local citizens.
<p>Standing alone in the  crowd with my arms crossed over my chest, I couldn’t help but  frown.</p>
<p>“I can’t be  comfortable in these places.”</p>
<p>Almost as if it were on  cue, a scream and a crash answered my whispered words. I turned to  witness the executive director and a person in costume hanging  outside of a smoking window while coughing their lungs out.</p>
<p>And then the cause of  the uproar presented herself.</p>
<p>Minagi Mikoto came  bounding out of the opened window and landed right at my feet. Gazing  down, the girl looked up at me with watery eyes and a flushed face,  “W-water…”</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s wrong  with you?”</p>
<p>“Ramen…hot…”</p>
<p>I cocked an eyebrow,  smirking at the girl still kneeling in front of me, “Can’t take  the spicy stuff, huh?”</p>
<p>Mikoto just nodded  feverishly with a little whine.</p>
<p>“You really are a  kid…” I muttered, pulling out my wallet to inspect the contents  inside. “Come on, I’m sure they sell bottled water at one of  these stands.”</p>
<p>Before I could even  blink, the younger girl was on her feet and latched to my arm. I  grumbled as I slipped out of her grip.</p>
<p>“What are you doing  by yourself anyway? Where’s Mai?”</p>
<p>“Visiting her  brother,” the golden-eyed HiME pouted.</p>
<p>“And she let you come  here alone?”</p>
<p>At this, Mikoto shook  her head, “Not alone, with Aoi and Chie.”</p>
<p>“So those two are  supposed to be babysitting you…”</p>
<p>A glare.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I forgot,”  I pleaded. “Ah, here we are.”</p>
<p>Luckily there wasn’t  much of a line at the drink stand, so it only took a minute or so to  purchase the water. It was gone in about two seconds though.</p>
<p>The girl released a  contented sigh once she had guzzled down the liquid.</p>
<p>“Better?” I  questioned.</p>
<p>“Mmh.”</p>
<p>“Alright, now to just  find that Gossip Queen and her sidekick.”</p>
<p>“What’s sidekick?”  Mikoto asked as we began to walk, “Like this?”</p>
<p>The girl suddenly made  to strike me with her foot, but I swiftly caught the limb before it  could nail me in the hip and shoved it down, “No! It’s like a  second in command or something!”</p>
<p>The girl just stared at  me quizzically.</p>
<p>“Never mind, just  walk.”</p>
<p>And walk we did…about  three steps.</p>
<p>“Hey! Where are you  going?”</p>
<p>“Food!”</p>
<p>“Now? But we’re  trying to find—“</p>
<p>It was too late. The  girl was already in the middle of ordering a pair of skewers  decorated with various meats and vegetables, having knocked some of  the other customers out of her way in the process. Of course when it  came to the payment of these kabobs I had to cough up the cash. Once  I had avoided several glares and the transition was completed, I  tried to get us moving again.</p>
<p>“Alright, so that’ll  keep you satisfied until we find Harada and Senou, right?”</p>
<p>I didn’t get a  response as the middle schooler was busy devouring her new snack.</p>
<p>The two of us had  walked a bit further when I felt the slight tugging on my shirt. At  the contact, I turned to the shorter girl, “What now?”</p>
<p>“Is Natsuki here by  herself?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>She tilted her head,  “Natsuki isn’t happy?”</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p>“Then why is Natsuki  here?”</p>
<p>“Because I was asked  to be.”</p>
<p>“By who?”</p>
<p>“…You remember the  kaichou, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Mikoto squinted her  eyes in contemplation for a moment before nodding, “Mmh. Where is  she?”</p>
<p>“She had some student  council business to attend to.”</p>
<p>“Is that why Natsuki  is sad?”</p>
<p>I was slightly taken  aback from the innocent question and gazed down at the girl who met  me with expectant eyes, “I didn’t say I was <em>sad</em>,  just—Well, you see—Eh…I…I guess you could say that…”</p>
<p>“Natsuki needs food!  Food makes Mikoto happy,” the girl exclaimed before running on  ahead, her head swiveling back and forth in search of something new  to consume.</p>
<p>“H-Hey! Get back  here!”</p>
<p>I jogged after the  animalistic youngster, and once she had stopped for an instant, I  caught her by one of her braids.</p>
<p>She whipped her head  around, excitement in her eyes, “What are those?”</p>
<p>I followed the  direction in which she was pointing, “Huh? Oh, doughnuts.”</p>
<p>“Can I have some?”</p>
<p>An irksome frown  appeared on my face, “This is the last one, okay? No more after  this, got it?”</p>
<p>“Right!”</p>
<p>I made my way over to  the stand, Mikoto at my side impatiently marching in place. The man  behind the counter bemusedly looked us over before speaking, “How  can I help you?”</p>
<p>“Can I get a couple  of…”</p>
<p>I glanced at the girl  beside me who had drool visibly running down the side of her mouth.</p>
<p><em>Remember, she’s a  bottomless pit. We need something to occupy her long enough to find  her babysitters.</em></p>
<p>“Actually, you can  you just fill a bag with them?”</p>
<p>“A-are you sure about  that Miss?”</p>
<p>“Positive,” I  curtly responded.</p>
<p>The man set to his  work, “So…is this for a group?”</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>When he looked up at  me, I simply nodded my head at the girl beside me.</p>
<p>“O-Oh…”</p>
<p>“Yeah…”</p>
<p>He handed Mikoto the  bag and I gave him his money, which ended up sucking my wallet dry,  before we finally continued our search. The younger girl downed a  couple of the sweet pastries as we walked, and was about to start on  the next when she stopped again.</p>
<p>“That too.”</p>
<p>“Enough is enough!”  I screamed, finally losing my patience.</p>
<p>I mean, the girl had an  entire bag of doughnuts in her arms and she was <em>still</em> asking  for more food. It wasn’t like I could provide her any more even if  I wanted to since I was now flat broke. Of course, I could solve that  problem when I got home, I never did like to carry too much cash  around with me, but that wasn’t an option at the moment…or <em>ever</em> to be perfectly honest.</p>
<p>“You’ve had plenty  of time to eat and rampage,” I continued, picking her up by the  collar of her uniform like one would with a puppy…or like the cat  she was.</p>
<p>To my relief, I spotted  the two girls we had been searching for all afternoon and promptly  dropped Mikoto in front of them, “Hey! Tell this thing’s owner to  discipline her, give her a collar, or slam her in a cage.”</p>
<p>Once I had completed my  civic duty, I immediately set off in the opposite direction to get as  far away from the cat-child as possible.</p>
<p><em>Honestly, my whole  day has been shot now. I should have just gone home when I had the  chance…</em></p>
<p>As I rambled on in my  head, a voice was heard over the buzz of the crowd and my train of  thought trailed off.</p>
<p><em>Singing now?  In…English?</em></p>
<p>Curiosity getting the  better of me, I backtracked towards the large stage that had been set  up for the day. Joining the ever-growing cluster of people  surrounding the platform, I gazed up at the large display screen that  showed a group of Fuuka Elementary kids, a choir it seemed, all lined  up. Only one of them was singing, however, a little girl with  striking blonde hair.</p>
<p><em>She’s pretty  good…English must be her first language.</em></p>
<p>Actually staying put for once, I stood there and listened to the  whole song before finally wandering off again. With a lot of the  attendees gathering to watch the choir, the pathways between the  booths was relatively clear, so I took the opportunity to walk around  again in peace.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Finally, the meeting  was over. I politely said my thank you’s and goodbyes to the men as  they left, and once they had departed, I set to cleaning up the tea  house. It didn’t take too long, but by the time it was all said and  done and I stepped back outside, it was already dark.
<p>Suddenly the sky was  alight as an explosion erupted in the air.</p>
<p><em>The fireworks show  has begun already, has it? This day has slipped by rather  quickly...but at least I’ll get to enjoy the after dark party. I  should probably change out of this first though.</em></p>
<p>I stayed where I was  for the moment, simply enjoying the beautifully colored fireworks  until they ended. Locking up the building, I began walking back  towards the school so I could go to my dorm and change into my  uniform. There were still a few stragglers here and there, but it was  obvious that most of the crowd had either moved on to the nighttime  events or gone home.</p>
<p>And then I spotted her,  sitting alone on the stage, gazing up at the stars overhead.</p>
<p>“Natsuki?”</p>
<p>The girl averted her  eyes to look at me, “Shizuru, hey.”</p>
<p>I continued approaching  my friend as she hopped down and walked towards me, “What are you  doing here? I thought you weren’t going to stay…”</p>
<p>“Hm, well, things  came up.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“And besides, I  wanted to see what you’d been up to all week.”</p>
<p>“But I thought  Natsuki didn’t like things such as this?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, but you  worked hard to organize all of this, didn’t you? I wanted to check  it out. I honestly can’t see how you pulled all of this together.  It’s amazing really.”</p>
<p>“You act as if I did  it all by myself. I had quite a lot of help, you know.”</p>
<p>“But you put in the  hours too, right? You should give yourself some credit.”</p>
<p>I blushed at her kind  words. Luckily the darkness sheltered me enough that the emerald-eyed  girl didn’t notice.</p>
<p>“Ookini, Natsuki…”</p>
<p>“So, did the meeting  go well? What was it about anyway? Or is it top secret?”</p>
<p>I chuckled, “It was  just to discuss what some of our suppliers would be offering the  school this year, and it went rather smoothly if I do say so myself.”</p>
<p>“Knowing your  negotiation skills, I don’t doubt it.”</p>
<p>“Ara, what is that  supposed to mean, Natsuki?”</p>
<p>The girl playfully  shrugged at me before changing the subject, “You look nice though.  I don’t think I’ve ever seen you in a kimono before…Do you  always dress up for older men like this?”</p>
<p>“Natsuki!” I gasped  at her implication.</p>
<p>She laughed, “Kidding,  kidding. I can get a shot in every now and then, can’t I?”</p>
<p>I just pouted, “Mou,  Natsuki…such a meanie…”</p>
<p>“Seriously though,  since today was a bust, do you want to go get something to eat?”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m  starving, but…uh…you’re going to have to pay…”</p>
<p>I squinted my eyes at  her, “So Natsuki is using me to get a free meal is it?”</p>
<p>“Eh! No! I-It’s not  like that, Shizuru, I swear,” the girl stuttered.</p>
<p>“Oh really?”</p>
<p>The biker straightened  and looked me square in the eyes, “Yes.”</p>
<p><em>So cute…how could  I ever deny you, Natsuki? Especially since you seem to be in such a  pleasant mood…</em></p>
<p>“Hmm…Okay, dinner  is my treat this time, but Natsuki is picking up the tab on our next  date, agreed?”</p>
<p>I was rewarded with a  blush, “F-Fine…But do you always have to call it <em>that</em>?”</p>
<p>“What would Natsuki  have me call it then?” I questioned as I began walking again, the  other girl immediately doing the same.</p>
<p>“I…well, I don’t  know, but not <em>that</em>.”</p>
<p>“And what is <em>that</em>,  Natsuki?”</p>
<p>A whispered mumble  barely reached my ears.</p>
<p>“What was that,  Natsuki? I couldn’t hear you…”</p>
<p>A sideways glance was  shot my way, “…A…<em>date</em>…”</p>
<p>I smiled triumphantly,  “Alright, how about…<em>rendezvous</em> then?”</p>
<p>“What?! No! That’s  even worse! Like we’re sneaking around or something!”</p>
<p>“Are we not? It’s  not like anyone really knows of our little friendship.”</p>
<p>“Oi, Shizuru…you’re  catching up on this past week’s missed teasing, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>I turned my face away  from her, covering my mouth as I giggled, “It does seem that way,  doesn’t it? Gomen, Natsuki.”</p>
<p>“Bah…Where are we  headed anyway?”</p>
<p>“To my dorm first so  I can change.”</p>
<p>“And after that?”</p>
<p>“That’s yet to be  decided. They will have things to eat at the after dark events, you  know.”</p>
<p>“Eh, I think I’ve  been around the school as long as I can tolerate for today…You  don’t have to attend that after party thing, do you?”</p>
<p>I considered this for a  moment, “I’m sure I wouldn’t be missed with that many people  around.”</p>
<p>“And your <em>beloved</em> club?” came the sarcastic inquiry.</p>
<p>“Ara…they probably  would, but they would also never rat me out for skipping,” I  answered with a wink.</p>
<p>“I think you’ve  been hanging around me too long, Shizuru…I’m turning you into a<em>delinquent</em> like I am.”</p>
<p>“If it’s because of  Natsuki, then I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>Natsuki just shook her  head at my words as we came up on my dorm building. Once we were  inside my room, I immediately set to changing. I stole a peek over at  the girl seated on the couch, and chuckled to myself when I saw that  she had her head turned defiantly in the other direction, but even  that couldn’t hide the slight pink on her cheeks. I could have  easily undressed in the bathroom and not put poor Natsuki in the  awkward position she was in now, but where was the fun in that? I  simply enjoyed watching her become flustered…maybe a little too  much.</p>
<p>After I was adorned in  my school uniform again, I trudged over and plopped down beside her  on the couch, “So, what now? I do have food here that we could  fix.”</p>
<p>Finally she faced me  again, “I don’t want to make you cook, especially after the long  day you’ve had.”</p>
<p>“I really don’t  mind. Or is Natsuki afraid of my cooking?”</p>
<p>“What?! T-That’s  not it…I just thought you might like a break for once is all...”</p>
<p>“Natsuki is so  considerate,” I playfully affirmed, and the girl’s face colored  yet again.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m sure  you’re tired, so how about we just order something?”</p>
<p>“That’s fine with  me. What should we get?”</p>
<p>“Your choice.”</p>
<p>“Mmm…How about a  pizza?”</p>
<p>“And here I was  thinking you were a health freak…”</p>
<p>“I like to indulge  myself every now and then like anyone else. Is pizza okay with you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s fine.  Do you have a number for any place in particular?”</p>
<p>“I think there’s  one of the fridge,” I remarked and began to stand, but Natsuki was  quick to pull me back down by the wrist.</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> lay down  and relax. Let me handle this.”</p>
<p>I did as I was told,  reclining on my stomach as I watched my raven-haired friend trek into  the kitchen and inspect the refrigerator door. It didn’t take her  long to find the slip of paper I had spoken of.</p>
<p>“So what kind do you  want?” she asked while dialing.</p>
<p>“Anything <em>normal</em> is fine.”</p>
<p>The girl just rolled  her eyes at me as she placed her cell to her ear.</p>
<p>“Yeah, can I get a  medium pepperoni pizza? Delivery. Fuuka Academy Lane, complex one,  room two-o-eight. Yes, that’s correct. Alright, thanks.”</p>
<p>Once she was finished,  Natsuki closed her phone and slipped it back into her pocket.  Returning to me, she lied down beside the couch and stretched out on  her back, “Fifteen minutes.”</p>
<p>“Mmh,” I gave my  muffled reply as I gazed down at her.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes as  she spoke, “It’s been a long time since I’ve been here.”</p>
<p>“Too long,” I  retorted as I grabbed one of the nearby pillows and smacked the  oblivious girl on the chest.</p>
<p>“Agh! Hey!” Natsuki  cried out before promptly returning the favor.</p>
<p>I shrieked before  trying to retaliate, but my assailant had already rolled out of the  way.</p>
<p>Due to both of our  stubborn natures, the war had officially begun.</p>
<p>As I was trying to get  up and arm myself with two couch pillows, Natsuki was retreating to  the beds to retrieve her own ammunition and protection. It wasn’t  very long before we were running around the dorm, pelting each other  with the fluffy items, but at the same time being keenly aware of the  very breakable objects that were scattered around the room. We had  been battling for several minutes when by some chance or another  Natsuki became completely unarmed and thus took emergency action,  which came in the form of a full on tackle.</p>
<p>I gasped as we flew  back onto my bed, losing my pillow in the process as the girl landed  on top of me, “Natsuki, that’s not fair! You can’t tackle in a  pillow fight.”</p>
<p>“Why not? There are  no set rules,” she protested.</p>
<p>“Have you even been  in a pillow fight before?”</p>
<p>“Have you?”</p>
<p><em>Touché. But I  still have the upper hand.</em></p>
<p>“Ara, but I had no  idea that Natsuki was plotting to get me like <em>this</em>…” I  began, turning my head away as I produced a blush to add to the  effect.</p>
<p>Finally becoming aware  of her dominating positioning over me, Natsuki instantly turned red  as she scrambled over to the other bed, “I-I didn’t mean it like  that! We were just playing around!”</p>
<p>“So roughly too,” I  added, hugging myself and closing my eyes.</p>
<p>The felt the bed shake,  and when I opened my eyes again, emerald orbs were peering down at me  in concern.</p>
<p>“I didn’t hurt you,  did I? I didn’t mean to—“ the girl quickly sputtered, but my  uncontrolled laughter quickly changed her expression to one of  annoyance. She spun around, her back now facing me, as she sat Indian  style at my side, “Bah! And here I was actually worrying about  you…I should know better by now…Just like in my dream…”</p>
<p>This certainly caught  my attention, “Dream? So Natsuki was <em>dreaming </em>about me?”</p>
<p>“No! You just  happened to show up towards the end…”</p>
<p>“Oh…? And?”</p>
<p>“And nothing! You  were you, teasing me as always.”</p>
<p>“I see,” I said  with a childish giggle.</p>
<p>My tormenting might  have gone on longer if there hadn’t been a knocking at the door.</p>
<p>Natsuki brightened at  the sound and turned to me, “Where’s your wallet?”</p>
<p>“In my purse,” I  answered, pointing to my bag over on the desk.</p>
<p>The biker quickly  bounded over to the thing, pulled out some cash, and answered the  door. When she turned back around, she had a thin box in her hands  and a wide grin on her face. It wasn’t long before said box was  thrown on the table, pried open, and it’s inner contents stolen. I  came over and took a piece myself. Turning the TV on, Natsuki, who  was in charge of the remote, flipped over to a sports station and  seemed satisfied with the soccer match she had found.</p>
<p>It didn’t take too  long for us to mow down the pizza…well, it was mostly thanks to  Natsuki to tell the truth. Once she had finished, she leaned back on  her arms.</p>
<p>“Phew, that was  good.”</p>
<p>“Natsuki really was  hungry,” I remarked, looking into the box to see only one slice  remaining.</p>
<p>“I told you I was  starving. I haven’t had anything since this morning.”</p>
<p>“Ara, you really  should take care of yourself more, Natsuki,” I replied in all  honesty.</p>
<p>She shrugged, “Eh, it  couldn’t be helped.”</p>
<p>A natural silence  settled between us for a few minutes, the only sound coming from the  low-volume television in front of us.</p>
<p>Curious, I took a look  over at my alarm clock, “The after dark party should be over by  now.”</p>
<p>“Hm,” Natsuki  noised, not really paying much attention, and then she suddenly shot  up, “Shit, my bike’s still at the school.”</p>
<p>“It’s hidden isn’t  it? I’m sure no one will bother it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but still…”  she whined, crawling over to the door to slip into her shoes.</p>
<p>Once she was done and  on her feet again, I did the same, “So are you coming back  afterwards?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Or are you going  back to your apartment?”</p>
<p>“Oh…Uh, yeah, I’ll  probably just head on home.”</p>
<p>I let my mask have full  control over my features.</p>
<p>“Then let me thank  you for tonight, and apologize again for today.”</p>
<p>Opening the door, my  friend stepped outside, “I said not to worry about it. The free  meal was equal payment in my book.”</p>
<p>“Natsuki better not  forget about our little deal,” I nudged at the girl.</p>
<p>“Right, right. I’m  paying next time. ‘Night, Shizuru.”</p>
<p>“Goodnight.”</p>
<p>I stayed in the doorway  until Natsuki was out of sight. Even after she was gone, and had been  for several minutes, I blankly sat on the couch, wishing that there  would be a knock on my door, the raven-haired girl standing there  telling me she had changed her mind…but it never came.</p>
<p>Sighing, I walked over  to my closet to take out my nightwear when the small stack sitting  atop one of the selves caught my eye. It was the clothing that  Natsuki had left here. They were <em>her</em> clothes. I reached out  for the shirt at the top of the pile, drawing it to my chest as I  tilted my head down to take in the scent of the girl that still  lingered on the article. My cheeks flushed.</p>
<p>“Natsuki…”</p>
<p>Changing out of my uniform, I slipped into the blue t-shirt that  belonged to my friend, crawled into bed, and tightly embracing one of  my pillows, I drifted off to sleep.</p>
