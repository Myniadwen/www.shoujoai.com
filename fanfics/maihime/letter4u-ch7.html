<a href="../maihime/letter4u-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>FROM THE PERSONAL JOURNAL OF KIKUKAWA YUKINO:

10/15: Mikoto took me to a tiny restaurant she found last night. It 
was a family-owned place that was little more than kitchen with a 
couple of tables squeezed in. 

In the dim candle light, I finally figured out what was so different 
about Mikoto. This cheerful, energetic girl I once knew had been 
muted. The light in her golden eyes had been dimmed by the cares 
of the adult world. In other words, she&#39;d found that one truth all 
adults must face: 

Sometimes, no matter how hard you work, or how fervently you pray, 
you can&#39;t have what you really want.


10/22: I haven&#39;t met with Mikoto in a week. Our schedules 
didn&#39;t match up; her with a term paper due and me with a deadline.

No. That&#39;s a lie. We were afraid. That night at the restaurant, I 
touched a deep and still bleeding wound inside Mikoto, as she did 
in me. Two people, surrounded by humanity yet utterly alone find 
one another. The odds are almost astronomical. 

But what was truly frightening, what absolutely terrified us is that
our bond is strengthening. Mikoto makes me feel like it&#39;s okay to 
love again. I think I do the same for her. But is that really such 
a good thing? What of those we both loved and lost? Are we allowed to 
find happiness without them?

10/25: I saw Mikoto again last night. We shared dinner and lounged 
while at my flat. We talked of simple things, work and school. We 
spoke of anything but what we were feeling. We wanted to draw closer 
but were afraid to. What would happen to our friendship? What about 
our unrequited loves? 

I finally told Mikoto my fears, and she admitted that she&#39;d been 
thinking the same.

&quot;It&#39;s like we were on a ship and were thrown overboard,&quot; she told me. 
&quot;We&#39;re miles from land and there&#146;s a huge storm coming. There&#39;s only 
one thing we can do to survive. Hold on.&quot;

Last night, I took Mikoto to my bed.</pre>
