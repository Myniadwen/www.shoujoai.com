He was a rat faced old man who spoke no Japanese whatsoever, but that 
was to be expected. Shizuru was forced to switch over to Russian while 
Natsuki simply admired what items he had in his collection. It was far 
more difficult to get such things in Japan. It was far simpler to take a 
flight to Vladivostok, the closest Russian port city to Japan, just 
north of the Korean border. It had largely been Natsuki&#39;s idea, though 
Shizuru was in no way protesting. A beautiful woman who lived in the 
middle of nowhere certainly needed some way to defend herself. The biker 
had offered to accompany Shizuru to the city during the winter break 
between her classes.

Why do you want to go? You don&#39;t speak any Russian beyond basic phrases, 
Shizuru had inquired.

It was answered by a simple: Because.

Because, Natsuki continued mentally, you nearly died in a car chase that 
ended up with you and Tanya landing in Kobe Harbor and then swimming to 
safety before the cops could find your sorry asses. This means you need 
a babysitter.

&quot;When you called with your request, I must admit I was a bit shocked. 
Now that I actually see you in person, I am even more so. It&#39;s rare 
enough I get requests for such weapons in this day and age, especially 
sharpened to battle ready quality, but someone of your build? The weapon 
is taller than you are, madame!&quot; He protested. &quot;Are you sure you can 
handle it?&quot;

Natsuki really hated that she couldn&#39;t understand anything that went on 
around her. She watched his behavior and body language to try and 
decipher tone and intent, but other than that, she was a little Japanese 
girl lost in Russia&#39;s far east. She shoved her hands in her pockets and 
continued to look at an old saber on display, letting Shizuru speak.

&quot;You would not let me return to Japan empty handed after coming all this 
way, would you? It&#39;s an investment alone to travel by air these days.&quot; 
When he started to shake his head, she managed her usual fake smile. 
&quot;May I examine it, then?&quot;

The case that was resting on the table was opened. Shizuru moved aside a 
cotton cloth and revealed a giant sparkling blade fixed onto a partial 
metal shaft that was about three feet in length. The other half of the 
shaft was resting next to it. She pulled out the top segment and 
fastened the bottom on. When completed, the custom bardiche stood six 
feet tall. Shizuru held it in both hands and lowered it down and back 
up, testing the weight and balance. It was not her Element, but she 
would get used to it. It was close enough.

&quot;The blade is made of bulat steel, as requested,&quot; he said. &quot;That stuff 
is very rare, so you&#39;re aware of the high price tag, yes?&quot;

&quot;One hundred and thirty thousand roubles,&quot; Shizuru confirmed, her eyes 
never leaving the weapon. Natsuki found herself staring at it as well, 
also wondering if Shizuru was capable of handling it. She was not a HiME 
any longer. She didn&#39;t have that burst of strength that came with such 
powers. Then again, most muscles built up during the Carnival remained. 
They all still possessed amazing strength.

&quot;Came in straight from St. Petersburg from my associates there,&quot; he 
informed. &quot;It&#39;s going to be awkward to use with a six foot shaft, is it 
not? It&#39;s meant to be far shorter.&quot;

Shizuru smiled. &quot;I&#39;m used to such a design. Something heftier, even.&quot;

She left a personal check for the bill and latched the case once again 
after dismantling the weapon. Task accomplished, she grabbed Natsuki&#39;s 
sleeve and led her back out onto the street and began to walk. Natsuki 
found herself the subject of a few stares, most of the residents 
distinctly European. Every once and a while she saw a Korean who had 
moved in, as the country was close to the border. That was it. She was 
used to Japan and being around those just like her. She&#39;d never been 
abroad. Different. Strange. She still loathed that she was rendered 
illiterate and speechless.

&quot;The return flight leaves for Kansai tomorrow morning at seven,&quot; Shizuru 
reminded. &quot;Don&#39;t stay up late tonight.&quot;

&quot;Yes, mother,&quot; Natsuki responded. She was still engrossed in taking in 
the sights of the city. Filthy place, really, but interesting none the 
less. Shizuru, who had never been there before either, didn&#39;t seem to be 
very interested in all of that nonsense. Getting to the hotel and up to 
her room was the objective. &quot;Don&#39;t you want to go out and see anything 
around town?&quot;

&quot;Ara, perhaps after I unload this? It&#39;s not exactly as light as a 
feather.&quot; Oh, right, the giant pointy thing.

As they walked, Natsuki adjusted the sleeve of her heavy winter coat, 
which rested over a hooded sweatshirt and a shirt under that. She was 
not a fan of the cold. Shizuru, of course, was perfectly happy in a 
light jacket despite the freezing weather. She shook her head. Crazy 
Russian. They made it to the hotel, where Shizuru approached the people 
at the desk to request a room.

Natsuki watched, again not understanding the language, as Shizuru and 
the woman conversed. Shizuru did eventually turn back. &quot;I&#39;m getting one 
room. Going off of movie night, would it be a waste of money to request 
two beds? Or will you be a big girl and stay in your own?&quot;

Natsuki glared. Wise ass. &quot;Two will be fine, thank you.&quot;

&quot;Ara.&quot; Had she been sporting, or had it been before all their dramatic 
fighting as of late, she would have simply not said anything to the 
other woman and surprised her with a honeymoon suite and no way out. But 
that was once upon a time. They were speaking again, but it was still 
tense from their last verbal skirmish.

The pair headed up to their room and Shizuru immediately placed her new 
weapon under the bed for safe keeping. Discarding her jacket, she fell 
back onto the bed, not having slept well the night before. She stretched 
out, resting a hand on her belly. Natsuki simply watched her. She took 
note of the slight amount of skin, perhaps up to the bellybutton, that 
had resulted from her rapidly lying down. She averted her gaze and 
removed her coat.

&quot;So, we&#39;re not going out, then?&quot; Natsuki asked.

&quot;Forgive me. Perhaps in a little while. I&#39;d like to take a quick nap, if 
you don&#39;t mind?&quot; Shizuru asked, rolling onto her side, shutting her 
eyes.

Natsuki nodded. &quot;Of course. Rest.&quot;

A nap turned into overnight slumber, clearly indicating how fatigued 
Shizuru had been as of late. The same for Natsuki, who had been so busy 
preparing herself for some kind of Searrs interaction that she&#39;d hardly 
had time for socialization or rest for herself. At one point she got up 
to turn on the alarm for the morning, smiling fondly at Shizuru, who 
looked so very peaceful while she slept.

Natsuki slid back into her own bed and was soon taken by sleep again. 
During the night, what had once been cold and terrifying nightmares 
after the Carnival became unexpected but not rejected proper dreams. The 
gray and dead vision became warm and comfortable. The hand running down 
her stomach tingled rather than scarred. The whispers in her ear were 
not dark or icy, but rather pleasing. She woke with a blush, still not 
wanting to even deal with such things.

- - -

They visited each other infrequently during the winter months. Natsuki 
was busy with the final stretch of school, and the distance made it 
harder to see each other. No computerized equipment in Shizuru&#39;s home 
meant no online conversations. Letters were exchanged now and again. 
Natsuki visited Shizuru&#39;s home with the excuse of wanting to practice 
firing the Desert Eagles, to get used to them. She poured led into 
several dead logs out and around Shizuru&#39;s home from a distance after 
drawing makeshift targets (a horribly drawn version of Haruka) on them.

She&#39;d let Shizuru try to fire the Desert Eagle once as a birthday 
present (which also warranted the buying of tea, fresh scones and 
assorted other things). It had largely been an embarrassing situation. 
Shizuru had essentially just fired blindly into the woods, not 
accustomed to using a weapon created after the 16th century. The gun had 
flown out of her hands and Natsuki sarcastically said, &quot;You shame me.&quot;

Other than that, things were largely business. Shizuru was in the 
process of buying all new papers for her new identity. Natsuki had 
school. A global organization continued to monitor Fuuka. If any effort 
had been made to find Shizuru, they were failing to do so. She hadn&#39;t 
noticed a soul in miles.

Shizuru wished to return to Fuuka for one special event &#150; Natsuki&#39;s 
graduation. She&#39;d managed to pull herself out of her slump and ended up 
gathering near perfect scores for her final year. But, unfortunately, 
Fujino Shizuru no longer existed. Wandering through Fuuka, especially at 
a school where everyone practically worshiped her, would be disaster. 
When she had woken up from her hangover (thanks to Mai and another 
graduation party &#150; damn, had it been a year already?) she saw a message 
on her machine, the number listed being from Shizuru&#39;s new cellphone.

&quot;I hope Natsuki&#39;s head does not throb too much from the alcohol she was 
sure to consume at the graduation party. Mai was able to properly put 
one together, I trust. In any case, I&#39;m calling to tell you 
congratulations. I&#39;m really quite proud of you and how much you&#39;ve grown 
over the last few years. Anyway...&quot; Shizuru&#39;s voice trailed off, no 
doubt conflicted with what she was wanting to say. &quot;Congratulations 
again. I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t be there to see you.&quot;

Yeah. She understood. It just stung a bit, regardless.

She spent most of the day speaking with the others to, as always, stay 
up to date on what was happening with Searrs. Nothing too terribly much 
today. No one had spotted any suspicious cars or shady looking 
characters following them. When at least one of them had had an 
encounter a day, Natsuki found the sudden absence of a threat worrisome.

With her father&#39;s monetary support having been dropped the moment she 
turned eighteen, she had been forced to get a part time job repairing 
bikes and assorted other vehicles at a shop downtown. She went down 
there for the day to earn her cash, but was caught by an unexpected 
question from her boss. &quot;Our Kyoto shop is short-staffed, especially 
with people who know how to fix bikes. Was wondering if you&#39;d be willing 
to transfer.&quot;

Kyoto, huh? &quot;I&#39;ll think about it.&quot;

The rest of her day dragged on like always. Work, check in with the 
others, play video games, call Mai, television, and what would usually 
be followed by sleep. But it was just too damn hot. For some reason, an 
almost agonizing heat wave swept over the region that week. The first 
breath of spring was brought on by a flamethrower, apparently. So, in 
her restlessness, she grabbed her phone and dialed a number.

It took a few rings before the person answered, still awake so late, 
even with nothing to do.

&quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Hey, Shizuru.&quot;

There was a slight laugh on the other end. &quot;Can&#39;t sleep either, can you? 
I thought you liked the warmer months of the year?&quot;

&quot;I like warm days, sure, but scorching sauna temperatures? No, that I 
can do without,&quot; Natsuki said. She played with a strand of her hair. 
&quot;Thank you for the call, by the way. It was nice to hear from you.&quot;

&quot;Ara, think nothing of it. I&#39;m only sorry that I couldn&#39;t see you in 
person. Perhaps Mai-san will post pictures online somewhere. I have my 
laptop, but sparingly use it. The generator out here is fussy,&quot; Shizuru 
explained.

Natsuki smiled a bit, but found herself struggling whether or not to ask 
something she had been confused by for a while. Shizuru had called her 
the morning of her graduation to wish her thanks. The most Natsuki for 
the other woman&#39;s graduation was carry her drunk butt home and not let 
her be taxicab driver entertainment. She hadn&#39;t even said 
congratulations to her about graduating with such high honors. She felt 
guilty and, finally, she blurted out a few words that led into her 
inquiry.

&quot;Can I ask you about something that happened a few months ago?&quot; She 
asked, and froze in fear. Dammit, too late to back out now. She didn&#39;t 
feel clever enough to make up a false backup question this late at 
night.

&quot;Yes,&quot; she said. She sounded, as Natsuki expected, a bit confused.

&quot;Well, maybe not ask,&quot; Natsuki stammered, feeling quite like an idiot. 
&quot;Ah, I&#39;m sorry if I act like a spoiled brat. I don&#39;t mean to. Maybe it&#39;s 
a side effect from being alone for so long. That was... really, what you 
thought, wasn&#39;t it? I don&#39;t know, never mind.&quot;

There was a long sigh on the other end of the line. &quot;Your dedication to 
your friends surpasses all, despite whatever socialization barriers you 
face.&quot;

That wasn&#39;t an answer. &quot;Shizuru?&quot;

&quot;Ara, why do you ask questions you do not want to hear the answers to 
when you should be rejoicing over your entry into the real world?&quot; 
Shizuru said.

Yeah, that was a blessed event. No more school, just work until her 
death. Natsuki looked down at her blankets, her gaze hardening just a 
bit. &quot;Well, I suppose that answers my question. Look, Shizuru, it 
doesn&#39;t take a genius to see that you&#39;ve been pushing me away since just 
after we graduated. I did something to offend you, and I don&#39;t think 
it&#39;s just that-which-we-do-not-discuss. Please, tell me. Mai and the 
others are only entertaining for so long.&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s safe to say I&#39;ve been pushing everyone away, not just you. 
Am I right in that?&quot;

Natsuki drummed the fingers of her free hand against her leg. She was 
dodging the question. She always did that. Sometimes she could be more 
stubborn than even Natsuki could. It was irritating. &quot;Shizuru. You 
cannot fix a problem if you ignore it.&quot;

Another sigh. &quot;You can be very sweet at times without trying, and when 
you&#39;re clueless as to how to react to something, it can make me smile. 
After a while, though, it just started to seem like I loved you more 
than you cared about me.&quot;

Natsuki prevented herself from groaning in frustration. Not that again. 
&quot;You got a girlfriend and moved on. I thought you got over that.&quot;

She was getting irritated now, Natsuki could hear it. &quot;I never cared 
about that, Natsuki. I never expected that to be returned. I only mean 
friendship, and always have, when I meant that I cared more than you 
did. Sometimes it felt like we were exceptionally close, and then other 
times I was greeted by a cold stare and a rapid dismissal as you marched 
off to who knows where when all I wanted to know was if you were safe or 
not. Protecting your identity as a HiME is one thing, but shutting 
people out all together is another.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s ridiculous.&quot; How could she think that? Who else was she close 
to?

&quot;Ara, perhaps you simply bonded with me because at the time I was the 
only one who cared. The speed at which you opened up to Mai and the rest 
of them felt like proof of that theory. It felt like I was clinging to 
something that didn&#39;t really want to be there, and I was stupid and 
willing enough to do anything to bring it back,&quot; Shizuru explained, 
beginning to rant about something she had never intended to speak of.

Natsuki paused, her eyes widening. She understood full well what the 
meaning of that statement had been. &quot;You can&#39;t possibly blame me for 
what happened to you in the Carnival. I never asked you to do anything 
for me. Gifts, protection, and the rest &#150; I didn&#39;t ask any of it from 
you.&quot;

Shizuru could be heard moving around, clearly distressed enough to get 
off her futon and start fumbling around with something. &quot;No, you did 
not. I offered them freely, and didn&#39;t expect anything material in 
return. A little more compassion shown to me, perhaps, or occasionally 
letting me know that I was actually wanted in your life.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a moron if you even think the opposite,&quot; Natsuki essentially 
hissed.

&quot;Ara? Well, that&#39;s good to know. And I do indeed know that I&#39;m 
important. But I&#39;m not all you have anymore. You have more friends and a 
new start on life. If you wish to go in another direction, I&#39;m giving 
you the freedom to do so. I don&#39;t want you to feel bound to me for the 
rest of your life just because you feel guilty about the past. That&#39;s no 
friendship. That&#39;s slavery. Stretch your wings, little bird.&quot;

&quot;Shizuru, stop being a melodramatic idiot,&quot; Natsuki grumbled. Honestly, 
now, how difficult did this have to be?

&quot;I told you to not ask questions you didn&#39;t want to hear the answer to. 
There&#39;s a breeze flowing now,&quot; Shizuru said. &quot;I think I&#39;ll try to get 
some sleep. We&#39;ll talk later. Goodbye.&quot;

Natsuki began to protest, but the line went dead, and she slammed her 
phone shut angrily. God damn it, she didn&#39;t want to be around anyone 
else and not because she was &#39;bound&#39; to her or whatever the hell she had 
gone off about. Right? She tossed the phone onto the floor next to her 
and rolled to her side. Sleep. Beating a Kyoto woman into submission 
tomorrow, perhaps.

- - -

Had she grown at all? Natsuki mulled over that earlier comment for a 
while in her restlessness. If she had grown, she hadn&#39;t noticed it much. 
She still felt very much like a child. She had acknowledged long ago 
that that difference between her and Nao had been that Natsuki had 
someone to rely on, which did not prevent her from being a delinquent, 
but at least made her halfway content. She still couldn&#39;t really believe 
that she and Shizuru had become friends. Neither could anyone else at 
Fuuka, for that matter. They were too different. Natsuki had avoided 
girls like Shizuru like the plague. It took, of all things, a fight to 
make them friends.

Natsuki was still in junior high, having just transferred in from Tokyo, 
where she had been staying with a foster family since her father wanted 
nothing to do with her. She didn&#39;t know anyone, and certainly made no 
effort to try. To anyone who gave her a stray look, she glared daggers 
at them. People were incompetent and moronic. She&#39;d learned that long 
ago. So, as one would expect, when Natsuki was caught by Shizuru out in 
the gardens threatening innocent plants, she was none too happy. As 
always, Shizuru guarded herself well. Natsuki didn&#39;t see the equally 
antisocial woman trying to connect with someone she felt had a similar 
outlook on life. Instead, all she saw was the antipodal persona 
presented by that smile and grace.

She thought Fujino Shizuru was nothing more than a rich and preppy snob 
who simply wanted to bother her. The harem that followed her around 
wasn&#39;t exactly welcomed either. Popular and sure to be airheaded, 
Natsuki wanted her to go away. The teasing and taunting she had been 
subjected to reminded her very much of a bully tormenting someone they 
deemed to be weaker. Natsuki... was not weak. Nor was she going to stand 
for such treatment, not realizing it was all in jest.

So, one day in the warmer months of her last junior year, Natsuki ended 
up picking a fight. Shizuru was walking back to her dorm, and casually 
waved at Natsuki when the younger girl marched down the street towards 
her apartment. Natsuki snapped her head around to look at her, and in 
the process, dropped her mp3 player from her backpack. Not noticing, 
Natsuki just kept on going. Shizuru moved forward, of course, picking it 
up and moving to follow.

But when she got a look at what was playing, something she would forget 
about later, she simply started laughing. &quot;Ara, western pop rock? Duran 
Duran, my goodness. What else do you have on here? Ah-Ha, perhaps? Or 
maybe Madonna? I didn&#39;t know anyone still listened to this pathetic 
stuff.&quot;

Eyebrows twitched in irritation as Natsuki grabbed the device and shoved 
it back into her bag, anger growing at Shizuru&#39;s laughter. That did it. 
Natsuki shoved Shizuru roughly on the shoulder, pushing her back and 
almost knocking her off balance. &quot;Who the hell do you think you are to 
criticize me? I don&#39;t care what your rich Kyoto daddy buys you, that 
doesn&#39;t excuse you from acting like a human.&quot;

Shizuru looked to her shoulder and back to Natsuki, her tone growing 
more serious. &quot;Ara, there&#39;s no need for that kind of reaction. It&#39;s a 
friendly joke.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not your friend. No, it&#39;s not,&quot; Natsuki hissed. She shoved Shizuru 
again, more prone to fighting in those days than at any time in her 
life. &quot;Get the hell away.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t shove me.&quot; A demand, not a request, the voice growing darker 
still.

Natsuki glared. Stupid Kyoto slut. She&#39;d probably sue Natsuki for every 
penny if they got in a fight. Rich people were always weak like that. 
&quot;Make me.&quot;

She would soon learn never to say that to Fujino Shizuru again &#150; because 
she was going to. Natsuki moved forward to once again shove her, but 
Shizuru slid easily out of harm&#39;s way, clearly intending to put up some 
kind of fight. All the rage in her life and towards this bully was 
channeled into her fist, and Natsuki sent a punch flying right towards 
Shizuru&#39;s face, not caring what those worshipers would think of their 
idol getting a black eye. The girl deserved it, with how conceited she 
acted. She expected contact and a yelp of pain.

Rather, she felt Shizuru move again, and found herself face planting the 
concrete sidewalk below, her face slamming down against it roughly, 
leaving a large raw and bleeding patch of skin on her forehead and 
cheek. She lay there stunned for several long moments, not sure just 
what the hell happened. Her arm kind of hurt, on top of it all.

What in the...? How did...?

Natsuki had been fighting all her life. She&#39;d taken martial arts when 
she was younger. She had been the unrivaled brawler on her school&#39;s 
playground. So how did this rich fool from the upper class manage to do 
that? They sat on their asses and drank tea all day. She scrambled back 
up to her feet, staring at Shizuru in shock over what had just happened.

&quot;Ara, ara, you shouldn&#39;t do that to someone who has a black belt in 
Aikido. Such recklessness.&quot;

Shizuru pulled the mp3 player back out from Natsuki&#39;s bag and walked 
away with it, leaving Natsuki stunned and in awe. She started listening 
to it, claiming it as her own, walking away like a proper bully who had 
just won something from a victim. Natsuki charged after her but found 
herself hitting the ground again after a seemingly effortless toss by 
Shizuru. The Russian girl shook her head and kept on going.

&quot;You can have it back when you learn to play nicely with other 
children,&quot; Shizuru lectured.

Natsuki never got it back. For some reason, however, getting her ass 
kicked by that otherwise lethargic woman became the very reason that 
Natsuki was intrigued by her. She was a walking contradiction. Calm, 
graceful and ladylike &#150; yet also well trained in martial arts and the 
naginata to the point where she could render an enemy helpless. Slow 
moving but athletic beyond what most people could ever manage. Friendly, 
yet as introverted as she was. She hated weakness. After seeing that 
Shizuru was not weak willed or weak in body, that was when she started 
to tolerate her.

She had gotten over her urge to fight anything that moved, and had 
welcomed the friendship after such an encounter. So perhaps she had 
grown a little. Even still, she felt very much like she needed to have 
her ass kicked again. Maybe it would knock some sense into her.

- - -

Still too fucking hot to sleep. She tossed and turned for a great while 
before she finally felt her eyes start to close. She heard a minor 
rattling noise coming from her open window. Probably the breeze against 
something or another. She yawned and continued to drift off, the 
blankets tossed aside long ago. Then, she heard the rattle a second 
time, followed by what sounded like a click against her floor. She 
gently opened one eye, just barely, to see what it was.

She froze.

Two men dressed in black, each holding a weapon. One waited next to the 
window while the other crept closer to her. Her eye was still largely 
shut, and she doubted he could even tell. Searrs, no doubt. Agonizingly 
slow, she stretched her arm out under her pillow, her fingers gripping 
warm metal and plastic. Her fist tightened as he got closer still. Her 
breathing stopped.

One of his hands reached out to grab hold of her. His look was cold and 
detached, purely scientific. Fingers were mere a mere inch away from her 
flesh before she sprung into action. She slid a Desert Eagle out from 
under her pillow and fired. The man&#39;s innards were ripped to shreds as 
the powerful bullet raced through, smashing and tearing everything in 
its path. Splatters of blood landed on Natsuki&#39;s face and tank top, 
tainting her flesh. His body slumped against hers as he fell over dead.

Seeing his cohort raise his gun, Natsuki fired again, hitting him right 
between the eyes. His skull and brain hit her far wall before he too 
slumped down to the ground. She already heard screams coming from her 
neighbors out in the hall. She kicked the corpse off her body and 
scrambled to her closet, pulling on her biking leathers and helmet. She 
grabbed the second Desert Eagle and her phone as well, checking outside 
for any more.

There was a slam on the door, someone trying to kick it in. Not wanting 
to wait to see if it was another agent of Searrs&#39;, she leapt out the 
window, grabbing onto a tree branch, her lungs being squeezed free of 
air as she hit it with her torso. She took a deep breath again and 
dropped to the ground, running for her bike. She turned back, though, 
aiming both guns at her window. Two more had rush in to get her. As they 
too prepared to fire, she squeezed the triggers. One hit, killing a 
third man. The fourth survived, ducking back into her residence.

She wasted no time getting on her bike and starting it up, racing down 
the street at top speed, heading to the freeway, riding off into the 
night to avoid capture. Where to, then? Sakomizu? No, too close for 
comfort. Shizuru. Kyoto it was, argument or not. After a mile of riding, 
she pulled over onto a side street and dialed Mai.

&quot;Tokiha, a bunch of Searrs guys just tried to kill or capture me. Watch 
out. They might hit elsewhere. Call the others, I have to get the hell 
out of here.&quot; She didn&#39;t wait for a response. She shut off the phone and 
just kept riding.

When she got on the freeway, she thought she was home free, the shock of 
killing someone set aside to make way for the proper ability to flee. 
She checked her mirrors time and again. She then noted, some eight miles 
out of Fuuka, that she was being followed by a truck and another bike.

The bike roared up towards her, a young woman riding it, holding a gun. 
Natsuki accelerated as far as the Ducati would allow, racing down the 
freeway at breakneck speed, dodging traffic. The other woman followed, 
the truck having to wait behind a ways while it tried to find a vector 
to follow. Natsuki felt a bullet zoom past her head, the other female 
taking a shot. Cars now willingly got out of their way, scrambling to 
move.

Natsuki slammed on the brakes as one vehicle came to a screeching halt 
in front, the other biker flying by in another lane, hitting the brakes 
as well but taking more time to do so. Natsuki leveled her gun and fired 
at the decelerating form, but missed. She took the nearest off-ramp down 
to the town nearby, ducking down streets and racing down alleys to avoid 
being seen.

At long last, it seemed like she was in the clear. The bike and its 
escort roared by the alley she hid in, and she backed up to go the other 
way once they&#39;d gotten a ways down. She took country roads to Kyoto, 
foregoing the freeway. Too dangerous now, it seemed. It took her quite a 
while to make it to where Shizuru now lived, sailing through Kyoto 
itself and then heading up into the mountains.

The longer ride had not calmed her nerves in the least. Her breath was 
shaky. Three people.

Dawn broke by the time she got there, the sun rising gently behind her. 
Shizuru clearly heard the motorcycle outside and exited her home, 
sliding back a thin door to her very traditional house. She froze as she 
saw Natsuki stumbling forward off her bike, visibly trembling with every 
step. Shizuru parted her lips in shock as Natsuki dropped both Desert 
Eagles to the ground, unfastening the belt that held them on. The guns 
hit the ground with two dull thumps.

&quot;Natsuki, what...&quot; Shizuru began to ask, holding out her arms, taking a 
step forward.

She&#39;d never killed anyone before, if one did not count Shizuru or 
herself. All her fighting had been done against Orphans. When it came to 
the humans who had invaded Fuuka, her attacks had all been non-lethal. 
She wasn&#39;t a killer. She was only there to defend. She had known 
somewhere down the line that she might have to kill, but had not 
prepared herself for the wave of horror that swept over her afterwards.

Her helmet was tossed to the ground, her eyes full of emotion, dried 
blood from her victim still caked on her face. When she unzipped her 
leathers, still wearing her sleeping attire underneath, Shizuru saw the 
large blood stain that had turned her white shirt red. Gloves came off. 
It was even on her hands. She silently begged and pleaded.

Shizuru raced forward and wrapped her arms around Natsuki just before 
the younger girl sank into the embrace, her legs giving out. Silent 
tears fell from her eyes as hands clung desperately to Shizuru&#39;s night 
kimono. Shizuru just let her, brushing her hair back, caressing the side 
of her face, gently telling her everything was going to be all right.

The Kyoto woman stood up after several long minutes, making sure Natsuki 
was mildly all right before going to fetch a moist rag from the kitchen. 
She returned, taking one of Natsuki&#39;s tainted hands in her own, wiping 
away the blood droplets that had dried there, turning her skin red.

She moved up, then, wiping the tears and blood from Natsuki&#39;s face, 
still whispering reassuring things to her as she did so. Natsuki held 
onto her arm, still needing that physical contact. Shizuru let her. 
Blood was cleared away. Much like with Shizuru, however, it would never 
really be gone.

&quot;Come inside. I&#39;ll fetch you a kimono. We&#39;ll throw your clothes away,&quot; 
Shizuru said. She pulled Natsuki up, held her for a moment, then ushered 
her inside. Reaching into a closet, she pulled out a spare kimono, 
suddenly so reminded of that infamous night that it almost made her 
sick, and handed it to the other girl.

Shizuru stepped out of the room to let her change, and Natsuki returned 
timidly a few minutes later, holding her bloody and ruined clothes in 
her hands. Shizuru took them and promptly got rid of them. While Natsuki 
was changing, she had been preparing a separate futon in the next room. 
It was dawn, but Natsuki hadn&#39;t slept at all. She needed rest.

Shizuru pulled her into another embrace and held her again, running her 
fingers through her hair. &quot;You should get some sleep.&quot;

Like a child lectured by mother, Natsuki slid into the futon and tried 
to lie down, but her frantic mind couldn&#39;t manage sleep. As Shizuru 
retreated, Natsuki grabbed at her purple robe and pulled her back. 
&quot;Please don&#39;t go. Please. Promise.&quot;

Shizuru turned around and slowly sat next to the other woman, who lay 
back down. Shizuru continued to caress Natsuki&#39;s hair in that slow and 
comforting manner, watching the younger girl roll and adjust until she 
had come to use Shizuru&#39;s legs as a pillow, tears continuing to fall 
until she finally fell into slumber.

&quot;Ara, you must stop following behind me in everything I do, little 
girl,&quot; Shizuru whispered sadly. With Natsuki asleep, she returned the 
girl to the futon, and she promptly curled into a fetal position. Not 
breaking the promise Natsuki had wanted her to keep, Shizuru lay down 
next to her, holding her for however long Natsuki required sleep, 
kissing her brow once as a way of saying goodnight.

Don&#39;t worry, Natsuki. After the first kill, it gets easier.

an: I could very well be bullshitting about Natsuki having never killed 
anyone (aside from Shizuru). I remember in the Alyssa arc that she and 
the others left everyone alive who attacked, but other than that, I&#39;m 
not sure. The worst she ever did was accidentally gouge out Nao&#39;s eye, 
but I&#39;m sure Nao-san could have made a nice life for herself as a 
pirate. I don&#39;t know, I haven&#39;t seen it for a long while. :P</pre>
