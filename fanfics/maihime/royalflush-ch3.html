    <p>Peals of golden laughter filled   the tiny dormitory room as Aoi collapsed in an amused heap onto her   bed. Chie was sitting next to her <em>sans</em> her trademark glasses   bundled up in one of Aoi’s oversized, fluffy towels. Her cheeks shone   pink with embarrassment. She had tried to explain why she and the others   were sitting around drinking and playing cards in the buff, but with   every word, Chie dug herself a deeper hole from which she was sure she   couldn’t get out of.</p>
    <p>Aoi gasped several times in an   attempt to catch her breath from laughing so hard. “I just can’t   believe you let them talk you into this.”</p>
    <p>“It’s not like I set out to   get naked in front of my classmates,” Chie pouted. “Besides, I had   every intention of winning until that hellcat Kuga and the ever-sly   kaichou-sama dismantled us all with their little rivalry. Who knew they   could be so bloody dangerous?”</p>
    <p>A short bark of laughter escaped   Aoi despite a vain attempt to regain her composure. “<em>I</em> could’ve   told you that they were a force to be reckoned with. Nao twitches anytime   Fujino-sama is within sight so whatever happened between them, it can’t   have been good.”</p>
    <p>The brunette leaned back on her   elbows and stared out the dorm room window with a wistful look in her   blue eyes. She inwardly cursed her slave-driving boss for making her   take someone else shift. The perfect opportunity to tell Chie how she   felt had presented itself in her absence and for the first time in her   life, the metallic taste of irony filled her mouth. Maa,” she chirped.   “What’s done is done. Although I <em>am</em> a bit jealous.”</p>
    <p>Chie blinked owlishly in surprise.   “Why?” Aoi was glad that she couldn’t see very well without her   spectacles as a wicked grin slid across her pretty face.</p>
    <p>“Well, for starters, I would   have definitely wanted to be there for the actual stripping.” She   moved ever so slightly closer to the object of her crush, taking note   of just how well her friend’s endowments held up the towel.</p>
    <p>Chie blushed even harder and her   ears turned the colour of a ripe tomato. “Y-you would?” She mentally   kicked herself for sounding flustered; she knew that she couldn’t   keep up her Rico Suave act around Aoi. The brunette’s open, unassuming   nature disarmed her every time. Whenever they met for coffee at that   hole-in-the-wall café in Aoyama-cho during school breaks, had lunch   together in the grassy picnic area near the lake or simply watched a   movie in Aoi’s room, all of the smooth pick-up lines died behind Chie’s   lips. She never felt the urge to use any of them on the object of her   affection, a fact she found quite odd and more than a little disturbing. <em> Maybe I’m losing my touch</em>. “I highly doubt it,” countered   Aoi’s amused voice.</p>
    <p>“Did I just say that out loud?”   Chie gasped as she clamped a hand over her traitorous mouth.</p>
    <p>“Apparently so.”</p>
    <p>Chie banged her head on a nearby   wall in mortification. She had given away the secret that she had held   in her heart for so long and was prepared to take her lumps like a woman.   “Caught me, eh?”</p>
    <p>Warm blue eyes sought out Chie’s   face leaving her to squirm uncomfortably under its gentle inquisition.   The two friends continued to sit in silence for a few long moments.   A sudden whirlwind of tepid night air from without ruffled their hair,   giving them relief from the closed warmth of the dormitory room. Chie   closed her eyes against the burning sting of rejection she felt sure   was coming.</p>
    <p>“That would be a first, wouldn’t   it?” Aoi murmured after a while. She reached out to take one of Chie’s   strong, limber hands into her own. Her fingers traced lazy strokes on   the soft calloused, flesh. “You know, everyone thinks that you’re   pretty fearless.”</p>
    <p>“Is that so?” Chie sniffed,   aware that unshed tears were reducing her vision to a muddled haze but   she didn’t want to let go of Aoi’s hand. “What do <em>you</em> think?”</p>
    <p>Silence reigned once more as the   two women continued to stare at each other. They each felt like they   were breathing rarified air; it was as if the oxygen was slowly, inexorably   drawn out of the room until all that was left was this leaden stillness.   Aoi reached up to move a bit of hair that had fallen into the older   girl’s eyes. The act itself, so simple and so caring, became the catalyst   for all that came after. Chie breathed a deep sigh of relief as kisses,   soft as fairy wings, rained on her nose, her neck, her eyes. She wrapped   unsteady arms about Aoi and pulled her close, heedless of the loosening   towel about her chest. As Aoi’s lips found their intended mark, their   world went supernova.</p>
