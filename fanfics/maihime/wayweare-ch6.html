<p>Homecoming</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  end of the second term came and went with little mishap, and I was  certainly glad to get the exams out of the way, not that they gave me  any trouble. I had always been a pretty good student growing up, and  that hadn’t changed as I transitioned into high school. I mainly gave  that credit to my good study habits. Now if I could only pass those on  to Natsuki…Not that she was unintelligent; she was quite the contrary  actually. She just didn’t apply herself when it came to her education,  or at least not very much, but she always managed to squeeze by  somehow, so I guess that’s all that mattered in the end.
<p>On the last  day of school before our break began, I met up with Natsuki after the  bell rang and the two of us rode her bike back to my dorm. She had  volunteered to accompany me to the airport after I had confirmed to her  that I had bought a plane ticket back home to Kyoto. I had told her it  wasn’t necessary, that I was highly capable of handling everything on  my own, but she insisted that she tag along so I wasn’t about to turn  down her offer.</p>
<p>I had packed a single suitcase the night before,  making sure I had enough clothing to last me the week first and  foremost. Besides, if I forgot anything important, I could always buy  it once I was down there. Despite the fact that none of the owners were  residing there at the moment, there were still housekeepers living  inside the Fujino manor, so I was sure it still contained most of the  items it had when I had left three years ago. I made sure to call  beforehand of course, not wanting my visit to become a surprise one.  Apparently the small amount of staff members that were still around  were quite excited about my return. They were looking forward to seeing  me again, the older maid Mrs. Hoshiro had informed me, and I think in a  way I was interested in seeing them again as well. I mean, I had spent  a majority of my childhood around these people…I wonder what they were  like now?</p>
<p>“Are you sure you’ve got everything? This thing feels pretty light to me, and you don’t seem like a light packer, Shizuru.”</p>
<p>I  turned to see that Natsuki has picked up my suitcase and was currently  bobbing it up and down in an attempt to determine its weight.</p>
<p>“Ara, I’m only going to be gone for a week. I really don’t need to take all the much with me.”</p>
<p>She  cocked an eyebrow as she continued to eye the case curiously, “Yeah,  but I thought that most girls end up taking more than they really need  to when they go on trips.”</p>
<p>“Maybe I’m not most girls,” I replied somewhat mischievously.</p>
<p>“I think we’re <em>both</em> quite aware of that already,” the raven-haired girl responded,  obviously taking note of my little joke and choosing to add to it.</p>
<p>After  I had gone through the dorm making sure that all my electronics were  off and that I had indeed packed all that I thought I was going to  need, the two of us headed out.</p>
<p>Natsuki refused to let me carry  my own bag as we walked to the bus stop. We had decided that it would  probably be too cold to take her bike all the way to the airport, so  instead we resolved to just take one of the buses into town. A few  minutes after we arrived, one of the giant white buses pulled up, and  after Natsuki paid for both of our tickets, much to my protest, we sat  down in a pair of seats near the back.</p>
<p>“I’m paying you back for the ticket,” I stated as I began to dig through my purse for my wallet.</p>
<p>“No you’re not. I said it was fine.”</p>
<p>“Natsuki, just take the money,” I ordered, waving the slip in front of her.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Natsuki—“</p>
<p>“I <em>said</em> NO.”</p>
<p>A  short staring contests ensued before I sighed and shoved the bill back  into my bag, “Fine. But I’m paying you back in some form or fashion  eventually.”</p>
<p>“Uh huh,” came her mocking reply. She was obviously  proud of herself for winning this round; the grin on her face is proof  of that.</p>
<p><em>Just you wait…</em></p>
<p>After about a thirty-minute  ride, the bus slowed to a stop in front of one of the airport’s many  entry points. We disembarked and hurriedly made our way inside, not  wanting to spend any extra time out in the cold than we need to.</p>
<p>Natsuki  and I stood in the large building that was bustling with people. It had  been three years since I was last in this place…I had forgotten how  very big it was in that time.</p>
<p>“So, uh, what terminal are we  looking for?” the younger girl questioned me as she swiveled her head  back and forth, trying to take the whole place in.</p>
<p>I fetched my  ticket from my bag, and once I’d found the slip of paper, I quickly  scanned it over, “236A. It should be on the second level.”</p>
<p>I made  my way to the escalator, Natsuki close on my heels, squishing onto the  thing that was horribly packed with travelers. I received a small push  in the back from the girl when a man behind her accidentally bumped  into her. He muttered a quick apology to her, but it sounded more like  an obligation and wasn’t very convincing. When she snapped her head  back around, I could tell Natsuki was quite agitated with this obvious  invasion of her personal space.</p>
<p>Once we were off the escalator, and actually had some room to breathe, we continued conversing.</p>
<p>“Geez, are airports always so busy?”  Natsuki agitatedly commented with a roll of her shoulder, “Oh, and sorry for hitting you.”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t your fault…Haven’t you ever been to one before?”</p>
<p>“I dunno…”</p>
<p>“What do you mean you don’t know?”</p>
<p>“Well, <em>I don’t know</em>. If I have, then it must have been when I was little.”</p>
<p>“So I guess that means you haven’t traveled much?”</p>
<p>“Mmm, not really. What about you?”</p>
<p>“Every  now and then when I was younger, father would take me along with him on  his business trips, but I haven’t been anywhere since I came to Fuuka.”</p>
<p>“You nervous about flying?”</p>
<p>“Not really, if I was I could have just taken a train to Kyoto.”</p>
<p>Well, I guess I was <em>a little</em> apprehensive about the whole thing to be perfectly honest. After my  father had died in that plane crash, I hadn’t been on one since. In  fact, I <em>had</em> ridden a train from Kyoto when I had first arrived  at Fuuka Academy. But Natsuki was right, I couldn’t run away forever…I  had to face my fears, and with this being one of them, a plane was my  only means of returning home in my mind.</p>
<p>Pushing these thoughts  aside, a playful grin appeared on my face and I gave the girl beside me  a little poke as I turned the conversation in her direction, “What  about Natsuki? Is <em>she</em> afraid of flying?”</p>
<p>“What?! Of  course not,” she defiantly replied, “I drive a freaking motorcycle for  god’s sake. There’s no mode of transportation that scares me.”</p>
<p>“Flying and driving are two very different things though, ne?”</p>
<p>“Psh, whatever. I’m <em>not</em> afraid.”</p>
<p>I  chuckled at her tough-guy act. Natsuki was always like that, and I  found it to be oh-so cute. Although I had joked about it with her  before, and despite that fact that she was actually younger than me, I  really did kind of picture her as my knight in shining armor…Silly, I  know, but I couldn’t help it. Not that I couldn’t take care of myself,  I was relatively strong in my own right, and I had trained in the art  of naginatajutsu while growing up in Kyoto. Still, knowing that Natsuki  was around to protect me, not just in a physical sense, certainly put  my mind at ease on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess we’ll just have to test that sometime,” I challenged her.</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>“We should take a trip together one of these days.”</p>
<p>“…Seriously?”</p>
<p>“Seriously.”</p>
<p>“Where would we go?”</p>
<p>“I  don’t know. I guess we’ll have to discuss that another time,” I said as  we reach the security checkpoint that cuts off the terminals from the  rest of the airport.</p>
<p>There were already lines of people standing  at each station waiting to be screened. We stopped a little ways before  this, making sure to step over to the side, before we turned to each  other.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess this is where we part,” I stated.</p>
<p>“Yeah…You  sure you’ll be alright? I’m sure I could find a way to get around  them,” Natsuki offered, looking past me to inspect the wall of security  behind me.</p>
<p>“It’s one thing to sneak into a school, but trying to sneak through airport security probably isn’t a very smart idea.”</p>
<p>“I guess you’re right,” she shrugged, saying it like it would only be a mere annoyance if she were to be caught.</p>
<p>“<em>Don’t</em> even think about it,” I warned Natsuki, giving her another poke to the  midsection to make sure I have her attention, “The last thing I want is  for you to get arrested for my sake.”</p>
<p>She just shook her head at me, shrugging again while giving me one of those <em>‘I’m going to act like I don’t know what you’re talking about’</em> expressions.</p>
<p>“Anyway…” I began, tucking a strand of hair behind my ear before stretching out my hand.</p>
<p>“Oh, right,” Natsuki mumbled, handing me my suitcase.</p>
<p>“I guess I’ll see you when I get back then?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah…I can come pick you up…or something.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t want to be any trouble,” I replied, using a line that’s more likely to come out of Natsuki’s mouth.</p>
<p>“No, I want to.”</p>
<p>“Alright, then I’ll see you when I get back. Goodbye, Natsuki.”</p>
<p>I gave her a small wave as I took a few steps back towards the security line.</p>
<p>“Yeah,  bye…Oh! Hey, call me when you get there, Shizuru. You know, so I know  you got there safe…or whatever…” the raven-haired girl sputtered out  quickly.</p>
<p>I smiled at her over my shoulder, and gave her a simple  nod of understanding before disappearing into the herd of people  waiting to be screened.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Much  to my relief, the flight had no real troubles at all. We took off on  time, experienced little to no turbulence, and landed in Kyoto slightly  earlier than previously expected.
<p>Once I got off the plane and  collected my bag, I began looking for Mr. Tanaka, one of the  housekeepers that was sent to pick me up. Mr. Tanaka had served as my  father’s personal driver among a number of odd jobs around the house,  so it was no surprise to me that he had been sent.</p>
<p>It might sound  cliché to say that I spotted him amongst the crowd holding a little  sign with my name written across it, just like a scene from a movie or  something, but that’s exactly how it happened. The middle-aged man,  probably in his late forties or early fifties, still looked the same as  I remembered, albeit with a little more grey in his hair.</p>
<p>“Mr. Tanaka!” I proclaimed as I approach him, waving with my free arm.</p>
<p>I saw his eyes light up once he’d spotted me, “M-Miss Fujino? Miss Fujino!”</p>
<p>“Mr. Tanaka, it’s good to see you again,” I said with a small bow.</p>
<p>He  returned the gesture, “It is a pleasure to see you again as well, Miss  Shizuru. My how you’ve grown in such a short time…Ah! Where are my  manners? Please, let me take that for you.”</p>
<p>He moved to take my bag, and not wanting to be rude, I willingly handed it to him, “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Well then, if you are ready, shall we head to the manor?”</p>
<p>“Yes, please. I’m anxious to see how things have changed since I was last there.”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  ride home to the manor is a relatively quiet one. I sat in the back  seat of the car, simply staring out the window at the scenery that was  flashing by, trying to take in the setting of my homeland once again.  The city landscape gradually faded into countryside, and before I knew  it, we were diving through a set of giant black gates that bear the  Fujino family seal when closed.
<p>I let a small sigh escape my lips  when the car came to a stop. Mr. Tanaka was quick to come around and  open the door for me, and I slowly stepped out into the cold night air  of Kyoto. Once he had retrieved my bag, the two of us made our way to  the front entrance of my Western style home.</p>
<p><em>This is it…No turning back now.</em></p>
<p>Mr.  Tanaka opened one of the wooden double doors to reveal a small audience  of people standing inside. I was met with three friendly faces, two  familiar, and one that was new to me.</p>
<p>“Oh, Miss Shizuru, it’s so  good to see you again,” the oldest of the group declared as she stepped  forward and drew me into a warm embrace.</p>
<p>I full-heartedly returned the action, “Mrs. Hoshiro…”</p>
<p>The  short and slightly round elderly lady before me, Mrs. Hoshiro, had been  my maid since the first day my parents brought me home from the  hospital. The woman, now in her mid sixties, did everything from  cooking meals to washing clothes in the house. She was the one who kept  things up and running on the inside, and she still did even though the  family was no longer living here. She was also in charge of the other  workers around the house. This kind old lady had been more of a mother  to me than my own biological one growing up. I owed her more than I  could ever hope to pay back in a lifetime.</p>
<p>Breaking our hug, we both took a step back to look at the other.</p>
<p>She  cupped my cheek in her hand as she looked up at my face, “You’ve grown  so beautifully. Why, the last time you were here, you were still a mere  child at my height...Now you’re a grown young lady.”</p>
<p>“A lot has happened in three years,” I replied, smiling at her genuine kindness.</p>
<p>“Indeed,  but it is still hard to believe that you’re sixteen now,” she stated,  letting her hand return to it’s usual resting position on her stomach.</p>
<p>I  turned my attention to the younger woman behind Mrs. Hoshiro, giving  the familiar face a small nod, “It’s nice to see you again, Mrs. Sato.”</p>
<p>Mrs.  Sato hadn’t been around as long as Mr. Tanaka or Mrs. Hoshiro, but she  had still been working at the Fujino manor for several years before I  left. She was in her late thirties, had long dark brown hair that was  always in a single braid down her back, and stood around my height. She  had always been quiet, serving as a helper to Mrs. Hoshiro mainly, but  she had always been kind to me.</p>
<p>She returned my nod with a small smile, “You as well, Miss Fujino. I hope the flight here was pleasant.”</p>
<p>It seemed as though she was as shy and soft-spoken as ever.</p>
<p>“It  went about as well as it could have,” I responded before turning to the  last member of the group, a young man probably not too much older than  myself.</p>
<p><em>He must be new…</em></p>
<p>“Oh, forgive me, Miss  Shizuru,” Mrs. Hoshiro’s sweet voice piped in, “This is Shinji  Takahashi, he’s the new grounds keeper in place of Mr. Endo. He’s  usually only here on the weekends since he’s taking classes at the  university.”</p>
<p>“It’s nice to meet you,” I said with a small bow to which he stiffly nodded without saying a word.</p>
<p>“Well, you must be weary from the trip, would you like anything to eat or drink?” Mrs. Hoshiro asked me.</p>
<p>“No thank you, I’d just like to retire for the night if it isn’t any trouble.”</p>
<p>“Of  course not, dear. Let me accompany you to your room,” she offered as  she began walking towards the wide set of stairs in front of us, Mr.  Tanaka following behind with my bag.</p>
<p>We made our way up to the  second floor and down a hallway to my room. After entering the door, I  saw that it looked exactly the way that I left it, just like the rest  of the house from what I can tell.</p>
<p>“I made sure to place some new  sheets on your bed, and there are also clean towels in the bathroom  should you want to get cleaned up,” Mrs. Hoshiro informed me.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>“Would you like me to wake you up in the morning for breakfast? We generally eat around eight o’clock.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please. I haven’t had a home cooked meal in a very long time.”</p>
<p>“I’ll see you in the morning then. It truly is wonderful to have you home again, Miss Shizuru. Goodnight.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t restrain my wide smile, “Goodnight to the both of you, too.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tanaka placed my bag on my bed before wishing me good night as well, closing my door behind him.</p>
<p>Once  I was alone, I immediately flopped down on my bed with a tired sigh. I  blindly fished around inside my purse for my cell phone, and once I had  found it, I pulled it out and flipped it open, the bright screen  illuminating my face in blue light.</p>
<p><em>It’s already past twelve…I’m sure she’s still awake though…</em></p>
<p>I  scrolled through my contacts list until I found Natsuki’s name and  press the call button. It rang a few times before she finally answered.</p>
<p>“<em>Yes?”</em></p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>“<em>Oh, Shizuru, hey. Did you make it home alright?”</em></p>
<p>“Yes, I’m in my room right now actually.”</p>
<p>“<em>Well that’s good to hear. So how are things there?”</em></p>
<p>“Pretty  normal. Everything seems like I remember. Granted I haven’t really had  the time to look around much…I just got back a little while ago.”</p>
<p>“<em>Oh, well, if you’re tired or something then we can talk later. I wouldn’t want to deprive you of your beauty sleep.”</em></p>
<p>“Mou, what’s that supposed to mean, Natsuki? You don’t think I’m attractive?”</p>
<p>“<em>Eh! No! I didn’t—You know I didn’t mean it like that...”</em></p>
<p>“So Natsuki <em>does</em> think I’m pretty…how sweet.”</p>
<p>“<em>SHIZURU…”</em></p>
<p>I chuckled into the phone, visualizing a very flushed Natsuki.</p>
<p><em>I can even tease you when I’m not there…You make this way too easy.</em></p>
<p>“Well,  now that Natsuki has professed her love for me, I think I’ll be able to  sleep quite well. Thank you, Natsuki. I’ll talk to you later.”</p>
<p>“<em><strong>WHAT?! </strong></em><em>I never said—!”</em></p>
<p>“Goodnight, Natsuki.”</p>
<p>“<em>...’Night.”</em></p>
<p>I  hung up the phone, flipping it closed once again before tossing it back  in my purse, laughing all the while at the little conversation that  just took place. Sitting up, I opened my suitcase and began to unpack,  placing the articles of clothing into the wooden antique dresser that  still contained some of my old clothes. Once I was finished and changed  into my robe, I made my way over to the bathroom to start my usual  bedtime routine. Choosing to just take a shower in the morning, I  simply washed my face and brushed my teeth before returning to my bed  and slipping under the covers. Before long, the comforting warmth  lulled me into a deep sleep.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Augustus!  Get back here!” a harsh whispered voice ordered, arousing me from my  slumber. The bed shook slightly before I felt four small bouts of  pressure move across my back. The next thing I knew, there was a  tickling sensation on my face. I peeked open an eye to be met with two  bright blue ones…and a very pink nose. I blew lightly on the small  creature’s face and watch it jump back, obviously shocked. I shifted,  grabbing hold of the grey and white kitten as I sat up in bed. He  squirmed at first, but eventually settled down once I started stroking  his soft fur.
<p>“I’m so sorry, Miss Fujino, he…got away from me…” Mrs. Sato’s apologetic voice came from my doorway.</p>
<p>“Causing  trouble for Mrs. Sato, are you?” I playfully inquired the cat, giving  him a gentle scratch on the chin, before looking back over at the woman  at my door, “Since when have we had a cat here at the house?”</p>
<p>“He  just showed up one day, ma’am,” she responded, taking a timid step into  my room, “We didn’t see any harm in keeping him…but we will get rid of  him if you wish it.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense. What did you say his name was?”</p>
<p>“Augustus, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Like the Roman ruler?”</p>
<p>“Mmh.”</p>
<p>“I see,” I mumbled before looking down at the fur ball in my lap, “It seems you have quite a reputation to live up to.”</p>
<p>Augustus looked up at me, merely emitting a little <em>‘mew’</em> for a response.</p>
<p>“Oh,  breakfast is ready if you would like to eat, Miss Shizuru,” Mrs. Sato  stated before bowing and exiting, leaving me with my newfound companion.</p>
<p>Looking  at him closer, I noticed that Augustus’ paws seemed to be larger than  normal. Apparently the little guy had been born with more toes than he  should have, an anatomical abnormality that I would later find out to  be known as polydactyl. It was odd, but absolutely adorable since his  feet seemed too big for his little body.</p>
<p>Picking up the unique  little kitten with both hands, I dangled him in front of my face, “How  does breakfast sound, hm? Maybe I can sneak you a scrap or two.”</p>
<p>Setting the <em>“little emperor”</em> down, I got out of bed and made my way downstairs, the small mass of fur bounding right behind me.</p>
<p>After  a wonderful breakfast, and a much-needed hot shower, I decided to spend  some time simply roaming around the house. I skipped the upstairs,  which mainly consisted of bedrooms, but that was really just to steer  clear of one in particular: my parent’s bedroom. The only person who  had been inside since my father’s death was my mother, and now that she  was gone, the door was kept closed. No one went inside. Not the maids,  not even me, and even though I had sworn to myself that this trip was  meant to put the past behind me, that room was still something I wasn’t  ready to face just yet. So instead I walked around downstairs, Augustus  trailing after me all the while.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how much  information the human brain can sustain. I remembered every little  detail of every room, and the new details stood out clearly to me. I  traversed from room to room, unconsciously leaving one very important  place for last.</p>
<p>When I found myself standing outside the double  doors of our music room, I didn’t even notice that I was holding my  breath until my lungs began to burn from the lack of fresh oxygen.</p>
<p>Father  used to play the piano when he was younger, so whenever he was home  he’d always play for me. He was the one who had insisted that I learn  to play as well. I always loved listening to him play those slow  melodramatic tunes, and although I wanted to make him happy by playing  the piano too, my true love was the violin. I had been forced into it  at first, but over time I came to absolutely adore the instrument. I  had actually become quite talented in the Classical style, but after my  father died, I slowly stopped playing. In fact, when I left for Fuuka I  didn’t even bother to bring the thing with me. There were so many happy  memories in that room, and I didn’t want to disturb that peace. I  didn’t want it to change. I wanted it to stand still like the rest of  the house had.</p>
<p>Taking hold of one of the golden handles, I  release the breath I’d been holding and turn it, pushing the heavy  wooden door inwards.</p>
<p>The room was cast in darkness due to the  thick material of the curtains covering the windows, blocking the  sunlight from filtering in. I could see the dust floating in the air,  my opening the door causing this disturbance. I took a small step  forward before a sudden flash of grey and white went streaking past my  legs.</p>
<p>“A-Augustus!” I stammered, chasing the creature further  inside. When I finally caught the little monster, scooping him up in my  arms, I looked up to see that I was standing in front of father’s grand  piano. A small, sad smile formed on my face as sat down on the  jet-black bench. I didn’t dare move the covering over the keys as I  stared at the instrument, but I did stretch a hand out to stroke the  polished wood.</p>
<p>“I wish I could hear you play…one last time…”</p>
<p>August  squirmed under my arm before clamping down on one of my fingers. I  gasped at the sudden prick, releasing him in the process as I look down  at the spot of blood beginning to form. The cat stared up at me, blue  orbs sparkling almost apologetically.</p>
<p>“Baka…” I whispered before sucking on the small puncture.</p>
<p>I  watched as the cute fluff ball trotted off to explore some more, and in  doing so, my eyes skimmed over a small brown case resting in the  corner. I stood and slowly made my way over to it, taking a seat on the  floor before it. I placed the case in my lap, and after releasing the  latches, I opened its top to look down at the contents inside.</p>
<p>The violin inside, <em>my</em> violin, was custom made in Italy. It had been expensive, but money was  never really an issue for the Fujino’s. It was a beautiful mahogany  color, and it still looked the way it had when I first got it since I  always took great care when handling it.</p>
<p>Picking it up from the  case, I placed the violin’s end in the crook of my neck. I delicately  laced my fingers around the bow, and carefully placed it on the  strings. Closing my eyes, I brought back the memories of those  countless lessons I attended growing up.</p>
<p><em>Just like this…</em></p>
<p>As  I pulled the bow across the body, my fingers moved on their own accord  on the neck, the notes seamlessly flowing from the instrument in my  hand. I played from memory, so the occasional mistake happened here or  there, but I was honestly surprised that I remembered as much as I did.</p>
<p>When  I finally stopped, a small quiet round of applause started from behind  me. I whipped my head around to see Mrs. Hoshiro, Mr. Tanaka, and Mrs.  Sato standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>“That was wonderful, Miss Shizuru,” Mrs. Hoshiro praised me,  “Have you continued playing while away at school?”</p>
<p>“No…Actually, I haven’t touched a violin since I left.”</p>
<p>She  seemed slightly taken aback from my reply, but she soon smiled again.  “You always were so gifted with the instrument…It shouldn’t surprise me  that you remembered, considering how much you seemed to love playing  it.”</p>
<p>I placed the violin and its bow back in the case, and once the top was secure, I grabbed the handle and stood.</p>
<p>“Truly, you give me too much credit, Mrs. Hoshiro.”</p>
<p>“Lord knows you deserve it, child.”</p>
<p>I could only smile sadly.</p>
<p><em>If only mom and dad could have felt the same…</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  next few days were relatively uneventful. They mainly consisted of just  lounging around the house, but we did go into town on a few occasions.
<p>During  one of these trips I picked up a black sweater for Natsuki. She never  let me buy things for her the few times we did go shopping together,  well, it was more like I drug her along with me, but that’s irrelevant.  This time she couldn’t stop me though. I had never really seen her wear  any fancy clothing, so she could use it, right? The sweater was a  little on the expensive side, but it looked nice so I purchased it  anyways.</p>
<p><em>I win, Natsuki.</em></p>
<p>Time flew by quickly, and  before I knew it, it was the day before I was to fly back to  Fuuka...and I still hadn’t done what I came to do. I stayed in bed  longer than I really needed to, lying on my back staring up at the  ceiling with Augustus curled up in a ball at my side. When I ignored  the call for breakfast Mrs. Hoshiro came up to make sure I had heard,  but I just told her I wasn’t very hungry at the moment. She was overly  concerned at first, just like she always was, before finally leaving me  to my thoughts.</p>
<p align="center"><em>How come you always get like this?</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>Hm?”</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>When it comes to your father, why do you always quit functioning like this?</em></p>
<p align="center">“…”</p>
<p align="center"><em>So you don’t want to answer that question…</em></p>
<p align="center">“…”</p>
<p align="center"><em>But we already know the truth, don’t we…</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>Stop…”</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>How you really feel about you father…</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>Please…”</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>How you secretly ha—</em></p>
<p align="center">“<em>STOP IT!”</em></p>
<p>I  angrily rolled out of the bed, much to Augustus’ displeasure, storming  off to the bathroom to get cleaned up. I needed to do something to keep  my mind busy, but unfortunately this probably wasn’t the best idea. I  watched my reflection in the mirror, staring at my father’s crimson  tainted eyes…the ones he had passed on to me. Tears welled in those  typically strong and sturdy orbs, but none flooded over.</p>
<p><em>This whole trip will be pointless if I don’t go there…</em></p>
<p>Leaving  the bathroom, I walked to my dresser, pulling out a thick sweater and  jeans, and after properly dressing myself, I headed out into the cold  December wind.</p>
<p>Trudging across the snow covered lawn, I reached  the large garden on our estate. I wandered around for a bit even though  there was nothing to see but dirt and bare branches.</p>
<p><em>Lifeless…How fitting…</em></p>
<p>Eventually I made my way to the center where a large stone monument resided, stopping before the block to bow.</p>
<p>“Hello again, father. Forgive me for not coming sooner…”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>I  straightened again, my breath coming out of my mouth like small white  wisps of smoke, “School has been going well. I transferred to Fuuka  Academy a few years ago. It’s a fancy private school, so I’m sure you  would have approved of it. I’ve been…working really hard…”</p>
<p>Silence again.</p>
<p>The wind blew my hair over the bottom part of my face, but I didn’t bother moving it.</p>
<p>“I wonder if I’ve…made you proud…”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Clasped hands gripped tighter.</p>
<p>“…If I’ve <em>ever</em> made you proud…Neither you nor mom ever seemed to see how hard I was  trying to please you…trying to live up to the Fujino name...”</p>
<p>My arms wrapped around my body on their own accord.</p>
<p>“And  then right when I thought you were beginning to see…right when we were  finally starting to understand one another…you left me…You left me with <em>her</em>.”</p>
<p>I shook my head as my voice deepened, “No, you both left a long time ago, didn’t you?”</p>
<p><em>Were you even there to begin with?</em></p>
<p>I looked up at the stone block, finally releasing the tears that had built up behind my eyes.</p>
<p>“I hate you, father. I hate you for leaving me here all alone.”</p>
<p>A single hand rose up, fingertips delicately touching the skin right below my right temple.</p>
<p>“But  you never really did leave me did you? You made sure of that. I see you  every day, father. Every single time I look in the mirror to see those  eyes staring back at me.”</p>
<p>The hand dropped, entering my coat  pocket to wrap around the cold metal object inside. I pulled out  father’s watch and stared down at the ticking hands, stroking the  silver plates with my thumb.</p>
<p>“But no matter how angry I get…no  matter how much my hatred grows, or if I can ever forgive you…I still  love you. For the few things you did do right, I’ll always love you.”</p>
<p>After  I got back to the house and ate dinner with the rest of the crew there,  I locked myself in my room. I was still quite emotional, so I had  remained rather quiet since I had came back to the house. Mrs. Hoshiro  and the others were worried, I could tell by their expressions, but  they were kind enough not to ask any questions.</p>
<p>Augustus was  still sleeping on my bed when I came trudging inside. He merely popped  his head up and gave me a wide yawn for a greeting. I plopped down  beside him, and lying on my side, I began to pet him, causing the  little creature to purr loudly.</p>
<p><em>At least one of us is happy…</em></p>
<p>I eyed the object on my nightstand.</p>
<p><em>I wonder if she’d mind…</em></p>
<p>I unplugged my cell from its charger and dialed anyway.</p>
<p>“<em>Hello?”</em></p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>“<em>Hey, Shizuru…Is something wrong?”</em></p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“<em>You sound kind of upset.”</em></p>
<p>“All I said was ‘hey,’ Natsuki.”</p>
<p>“<em>Yeah…Well, is there?”</em></p>
<p>I smiled inwardly.</p>
<p><em>Funny how you can just sense these things within me…</em></p>
<p>“<em>Shizuru?”</em></p>
<p>“Mmh, it’s nothing important really. I just wanted to hear your voice.”</p>
<p>“<em>O-Oh…”</em></p>
<p>I could practically <em>hear</em> the blush over the phone.</p>
<p>“You haven’t forgotten about tomorrow, have you?”</p>
<p>“<em>Of course not. What time should I get there?”</em></p>
<p>“The plane is supposed to arrive around six.”</p>
<p>“<em>Alright. And where should we try to meet up?”</em></p>
<p>“I think there’s a Starbucks on the first floor. How about there?”</p>
<p>“<em>Sounds good.”</em></p>
<p>“Oh, and I have a present for you.”</p>
<p>“<em>Huh?”</em></p>
<p>“I got you a little something while I was here.”</p>
<p>“<em>I thought I told you…”</em> she began, slight agitation evident in her voice.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, I know, but Natsuki wasn’t here this time to stop me.”</p>
<p>“<em>That still doesn’t mean that you had to buy anything.”</em></p>
<p>“But I wanted to.”</p>
<p>“…<em>Whatever.”</em></p>
<p>I chuckled into the phone, “You’re so cute when you’re being stubborn, Natsuki.”</p>
<p>“<em>Eh!”</em></p>
<p>“Well, I guess I’ll see you tomorrow then.”</p>
<p>“<em>Y-Yeah…”</em></p>
<p>“Bye, Natsuki.”</p>
<p>“<em>Bye.”</em></p>
<p>I  spent the rest of the night just watching random shows on television  while I repacked my bag, making sure to go to bed early so I would be  well rested for the day ahead.</p>

When  I awoke the next morning, at a relatively decent time, I got cleaned up  before heading downstairs for breakfast. Most of the day was spent  exchanging stories with Mrs. Hoshiro, Mrs. Sato and Mr. Tanaka about my  childhood. It was a fun and interesting change of pace to say the  least. It was nice to talk to all of them on a normal level for once,  almost like they really were family.
<p>When it was time to leave, there  were many long and tight hugs as well as exchanging of kind words. Mrs.  Hoshiro got teary, as expected, but I assured her that I would visit  again. I gave Augustus a kiss on the head, the little guy squirming in  my arms all the while. Mrs. Sato suggested that I take him with me  considering that he had become quite attached to me in the few days I  was here, and I probably would have if it weren’t for the school policy  about having pets in the dorms.</p>
<p>They all saw me out to the car,  Mr. Tanaka helping me inside, and after our last goodbyes were  exchanged, we took off for the Kyoto airport. Once there, Mr. Tanaka  saw me to the security checkpoint, just like Natsuki had. We said our  farewells, and I was sure to thank him before finally proceeding onward  on my own.</p>
<p>Luckily the boarding process went smoothly for me, and  soon enough, I was hundreds of miles above the ground, watching the  land of Kyoto disappear behind me.</p>
<p>Once I arrived back at the  airport, I quickly make my way to baggage recovery, and after picking  up my single bag, I jogged towards Natsuki’s and my proposed meeting  place. I was excited to see her again and to tell her about my trip in  person rather than just over the phone, but once I reached the  Starbucks, I found that the raven-haired girl was nowhere to be seen. I  waited for several minutes before giving in and buying myself a cup of  tea and sitting down at one of the small tables. By the time I had  finished drinking the entire thing, she still hadn’t come.</p>
<p>Eventually I pulled out my father’s watch to check the time, and I noticed that the hands had stopped moving.</p>
<p>I  tried calling her cell, several times actually, but the automated voice  just kept telling me that the number couldn’t be reached.</p>
<p>Natsuki never showed up.</p>
<p>The watch…the now broken watch…I should have known, right then and there, that it was a sign of things to come.</p>
