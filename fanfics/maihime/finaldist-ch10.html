<p>Two days  after her initial “interrogation,” Natsuki was rudely awakened in the  early morning and taken back into the camp for further questioning.</p>
<p>Her  single day off had come about because Bardas had decided to try his  luck with Jousuke, which unfortunately for the noble, was just as  stubborn and silent as his niece. The burly man had returned sporting  several injuries, mainly on his face since body blows didn’t seem to  have much of an effect. The massive amount of blood from his mouth, he  explained, being on account of the several teeth he was now missing.</p>
<p>With  this in mind, Natsuki was a bit apprehensive of what she would have to  try to endure, that anxiety increasing tenfold when Bardas informed her  that he would surely <em>“break her today.”</em> And break her he did,  quite literally in fact, because when the girl had returned to her  tree, her left arm hung limply at her side, features wracked with pain  and not wanting to account just what had taken place. Still though, she  assured the others, she hadn’t given up any secrets.</p>
<p>And then, a few days later, the time had finally come. The day to set their plan in motion.</p>
<p>Jaxen  emerged in the late afternoon, coming to escort Natsuki to yet another  session of questioning, but looking surprisingly calm despite the  burden he carried on his shoulders. After unchaining the girl, taking  caution of her damaged left limb, he helped her off the ground.</p>
<p>“This is it,” Natsuki whispered in his ear, “If you’re going to help us, do it now, before you take me to Bardas.”</p>
<p>Simply  nodding in compliance, the noble quickly unlocked the chains bearing  one of the nearby soldiers, Corin by name, who stealthily slipped away,  beginning the treacherous journey back to the Resistance camp.</p>
<p>After returning to Natsuki’s side, the two made their way towards the interrogation tent.</p>
<p>“After  you bring me back,” Natsuki continued her instructions, “you should  escape as well, just to be safe. Our camp is directly southeast from  here.”</p>
<p>“…I understand.”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“<em>Electroshock today, huh? How wonderful…”</em> Natsuki bleakly thought to herself as she helplessly watched as Jaxen  and another soldier attached the various wires running from the battery  to her body, Bardas patiently sitting at the controls in the meantime.
<p>After the two men had finished their work, they stepped aside to  allow their captain to start his procedure, which inevitably had to  begin with a speech as he stood and began to pace in front of the girl.</p>
<p>“What  is this…the third day I’ve had you sitting in this chair? I must  compliment you for being the first to last this long, of course, I took  it <em>a little</em> easier on you…considering that you’re a woman and all…”</p>
<p>Natsuki  mentally snarled at the sexist remark, but otherwise showed no outward  emotion, keeping her expression stoic as the man continued.</p>
<p>“But  you see, I’m done being nice,” Bardas stated, trailing his fingers  along the large battery sitting on the table near Natsuki’s chair,  “With this, I can’t lose. You see, either you’ll finally give up and  spill everything in that pretty little head of yours, or you’ll die  from having three-hundred volts of electricity course through your  body.”</p>
<p>“It’s really up to you now,” the man commented, poking the  girl’s shattered arm. Natsuki winced, but didn’t give the bastard the  pleasure of hearing her groan in pain.</p>
<p>Sitting down on the other  side of the battery, Bardas resumed his babbling, “Right. I think we  all know how this works. I ask a question, and if you don’t answer…”</p>
<p>With  a quick twist of the knob, a wave of electricity pulsed through  Natsuki’s body, but it soon dissolved, leaving the dark-haired girl  breathing heavily.</p>
<p>“Questions, questions…let’s see…Ah yes, you’re  certainly a relative of that politician Saeko Kruger, are you not? The  resemblance is striking…You’re her daughter perhaps? Tell me, where is  she now?”</p>
<p>Natsuki’s silence was met with another jolt of hot energy.</p>
<p>“We’re  getting off to a bad start, missy,” Bardas teased, “Alright then, why  is it that the Resistance suddenly pushed for an all out assault on our  troops?”</p>
<p>Again with no reply, Natsuki’s body was wracked with  pain, and she closed her eyes as her body convulsed. What she hadn’t  expected, however, was for an image of a certain ruby-eyed woman to  flash in her mind right before the current was shut off.</p>
<p>“Was the assassination of Commander Roland a direct order?”</p>
<p>Still  lacking any kind of response, Bardas huffed, “Fine. I see that you’re  going to be stubborn until the end. Congratulations on earning yourself  a death ticket. At least I can still have a little fun with you though…”</p>
<p>With another flip of the switch, Natsuki’s body was sent into another fit of seizures.</p>
<p>“<em>No…I’ve got to…hold out…”</em></p>
<p>“Fifty volts.”</p>
<p>“<em>I…want to…see her smile…”</em></p>
<p>“One hundred.”</p>
<p>“…<em>hear her voice…”</em></p>
<p>“One-fifty.”</p>
<p>“…<em>feel her warmth…”</em></p>
<p>“Two-hundred.”</p>
<p>“<em>SHIZURU!”</em></p>
<p>Turning  the battery to its maximum voltage, Bardas watched as the girl  violently shuddered against her restraints before her body went  completely limp moments later, an amused smirk forming on his lips.</p>
<p>“Good night,” he mocked, “You two. Dispose of her corpse.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” both men replied in unison, snapping to attention as Bardas made to leave the tent.</p>
<p>“<em>Forgive me,”</em> Jaxen uttered in his mind, feeling immensely guilty for just standing back and allowing the captain to murder his new ally.</p>
<p>But  as he began removing the wires off of her body, he noticed that her  chest seemed to rise and fall even if just by the tiniest amount. With  all haste, he pressed two of his fingers to the girl’s neck, searching  for a pulse, and his heart leapt when he felt a weak throb.</p>
<p>“She’s alive!” he suddenly exclaimed before biting his own tongue, cursing his stupidity.</p>
<p>“WHAT?!”  Bardas roared as he reentered, stomping over to the spot to take a look  for himself, “How did she…?! That was enough electrical current to kill  a grown man…”</p>
<p>Taking the girl’s chin in his hand, he roughly  tilted her head from side to side, “Now that I think of it, she doesn’t  seem as banged up as a few days ago…Just what in god’s name are you…?”</p>
<p>“What do you want us to do with her, sir?” the other soldier questioned.</p>
<p>Letting  go, Bardas once again made for the exit, “Tie her back up for now. I’m  going to arrange for her to be taken to the capital for inspection…”</p>

<strong>Chapter Notes:</strong>
<p>1. The level of voltage for the battery is based on a 1,000 ohms scale.</p>
