<h1>The Elements (part 9 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/keebler.html">Keebler</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/elements-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>After the girls&#39; expedition to Nick&#39;s Sporting Goods, they both ended up 
at Natsuki&#39;s apartment. It was the same size as the tawny-haired girl 
next to her. And it was actually clean; only thanks to the nagging of 
the superintendent of the Health Department, who explained how they had 
an A and once Natsuki came, it dropped down to a C-.

Once the girls dropped their purchases on the floor in the small 
kitchen, they proceeded to the main room and sat down on the worn down 
coach. Shizuru always liked this coach and use to remark about how she 
could never sit on it when Natsuki&#39;s apartment was a mess.

Shizuru sat down rather lady like, whereas, Natsuki just plopped down on 
the other end. Even though they were so close, Shizuru felt like they 
hadn&#39;t done many things alone with each other. And she was rather glad 
that Salavar went home without asking to come in-- not that she wasn&#39;t 
grateful for his kindness. She just wanted something he couldn&#39;t give to 
her...

The dark-haired girl looked at the other end of the coach. Noticing that 
the other girl looked rather out of it, she stood up and muttered she 
was going to the bathroom.

Once the dark-haired girl came back out, she saw the other girl laid out 
on the couch. &quot;What? Is she asleep?&quot; Natsuki muttered in slight shock 
and annoyance.

As if reminded, she looked over to the TV Cable box to see what time it 
was-6:36. It is later than I thought it would be, the dark-haired girl 
thought as she sat down next to Shizuru&#39;s head.

Both of them stayed like that for a moment until Shizuru opened her 
eyes. &quot;Ara, Natsuki,&quot; Shizuru said weakly as she slowly propped herself 
up onto her left arm and rubbed her eyes with her right, &quot;I thought you 
would make a move on my helpless self,&quot; Shizuru ended teasingly.

&quot;ONLY IN YOUR DREAMS!&quot; Natsuki shouted while a blush erupted on her 
face, &quot;I thought you were going to say something odd, but... Argh! What 
ever!&quot; Natsuki finished as she folded her arms over her chest and turned 
away from the cheery tawny-haired girl.

With a smirk, Shizuru wrapped her arms around Natsuki and gently pulled 
her victim into her grasps. Slight hesitation but mostly surprise, 
Natsuki just gasped lightly and looked at what she could see of the 
older girl.

Shizuru leaned into the nape of Natsuki&#39;s neck and then up to her ear, 
&quot;Oh... But this is my dream,&quot; Shizuru answered in a seductive tone as 
she took a nibble of that same ear.

Natsuki, confused and dazed, tried her best to escape. With Shizuru 
still nibbling on her ear, her body became surprisingly weak rather 
quickly, &quot;Sh-Shizuru,&quot; the girl mumbled in protest.

The older girl knew exactly what type of power she held over the girl, 
and she was rather happy about this. If she did anything like this back 
then, Natsuki would have surely escaped and ignored her for a whole 
week. Suddenly, Shizuru felt like she had been washed over with some 
unwanted feeling and let go of Natsuki. She felt sick-sick of herself.

The dark-haired girl took this moment to escape before the situation 
advanced to something she wasn&#39;t ready for. But, while she was fleeing 
she noticed something was wrong with Shizuru. &quot;Oi, Shizuru. What&#39;s 
wrong,&quot; Natsuki asked bluntly as she turned towards the other girl.

Shizuru looked up from her trance and Natsuki saw a smile. Not knowing 
if it was real or not, she wanted the tawny-haired girl to be happy. So, 
with that in her head, Natsuki hugged Shizuru. It was a rather clumsy 
hug. Actually, very clumsy. But when Natsuki recoiled from the hug-- she 
was pulled back into a tighter, and more emotional hug by the other 
girl. Shizuru had actually buried her face in the nook of Natsuki&#39;s 
neck.

After a few moments, Natsuki was still caught in Shizuru&#39;s cobra grip. 
Not unhappy, but, rather uncomfortable. She poked at the girl&#39;s side to 
make sure she hadn&#39;t died. A yip and Shizuru recoiled with a smile on 
her face. She looked gratefully at Natsuki before a twinkle of 
foolishness sparked across her eyes. However, the azure-haired girl had 
no perception skills and completely missed her cue to take up a defense.

Thus, with no &#39;warning&#39;, Shizuru pounced on her unsuspecting victim with 
grace and skill that would have impressed a lion. Then the war was 
declared. Shizuru, straddling Natsuki (who at this point was pinned to 
the couch), dove her hands underneath the poor girl. Once getting the 
green light to go, her fingers began to move in a twitching formation. 
Without understanding at first, the azure-haired girl started to break 
out in uncontrollable fits of laughter. Squirming and wheezing, the girl 
started to form tears at the corner of her eyes. She pleaded and begged 
with what little breath she could spare for Shizuru to stop. But this 
war was far from over. Natsuki knew that fact way to well from her 
previous experiences. So, as quickly as she could, the dark-haired girl 
turned to her side: temporarily pinning one of the devil&#39;s hands. 
Without wasting a moment, she continued from her defense to attack mode. 
She lifted herself off of the couch onto her elbows, releasing the 
trapped hand-but with no time for another attack from the tawny-haired 
girl, Natsuki grabbed both hands with her own.

This became the main turning point in the battle. Natsuki then sat up 
again, using the other girl&#39;s body to help her get up. She pushed the 
girl back and tackled her. With a gleam of revenge in the dark-haired 
girls eyes, she straddled the other girl around the waist: cutting off 
the legs from thrashing around too much. Then she went for the hands 
again. With an aerial battle commencing; one hand was easily taken down 
and pinned to the pillow underneath. However, the other hand made a 
swift escape: whirling around in the air, until, the unthinkable 
happened and actually caught the chaser&#39;s wrist. Natsuki had one of 
Shizuru&#39;s hands and Shizuru had one of Natsuki&#39;s. A dramatic pause.

Shizuru looked up at Natsuki with compassion and love leaking out of her 
eyes. Natsuki, actually noticing this gazed over look smiled back and 
leaned down to kiss Shizuru on the forehead. Right at that moment there 
was a small tick heard in the house. Shizuru turned her head and the 
clock read: 7 o&#39;clock. Then back at her lover. With a regretful smile, 
&quot;I have to go,&quot; came the words she had been dreading to say all night.

Natsuki nodded, let go and got up.

Shizuru sat up as well. Then the both of them got up together and headed 
for the door. Each grabbed some bags and headed downstairs where Shizuru 
was going to call a taxi.

As the taxi began to pull up to the curve Natsuki looked at Shizuru, 
&quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow early. Okay? You better get packed and 
everything, we don&#39;t want to end up running late. Because Mitoko and Mai 
are going to be taking a different car, because Mai is getting let off 
of work a little later then we are. Plus, you and I need to get the down 
to the camp site before they let someone else camp there, got it?&quot; she 
said informatively, while tossing the bags into the backseat of the cab.

Shizuru smiled and nodded. She kissed Natsuki on the lips softly then 
opened the cab door. She got in, with the door still opened; she finally 
let go of Natsuki&#39;s hand. Then she winked, closed the door and there she 
went.

Natsuki dug her hands into her pockets and smiled happily as she still 
felt the warmth from the other girls hand. Then she slowly walked back 
up to her apartment to get ready for the next day and the adventures to 
come with it. Hopefully nothing to bad will happen to them.
