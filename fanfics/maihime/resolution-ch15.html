<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The vein  pinched in this chapter is the Cephalic vein. It stretches from your  heart into your shoulder, and then reaches down your arm in two  parts, which reunite around your wrist—on the right side of your  right arm and the left side of your left arm—and flow into your  hand.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally,  in the course of writing this chapter, I realized I needed to think  of the noun for ‘simultaneous.’  After thinking for a few  minutes, I felt something poking at the back of my ass.  I reached  down, grabbed whatever was poking its little head out of there, and  came up with the word “simultaneity,” which proceeded to pass  spell-check and   I kick booty, and I thought you all  should know that.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  set Minrou, who had become remarkably quiet considering his vulgar  state not ten minutes before, down on the hard, grainy wood of the  boys’ bedroom in their cabin.  His actions were smooth and gentle,  and Midori, who had followed them, was just a little impressed;  Minoru was in relatively good physical shape, but he was also a  middle-aged man, and as such had gone just a bit to pot, in the way  that all middle-aged men do as their metabolisms unionize, and start  demanding shorter hours and better pay.  Midori smiled with  appreciation as Reito stood up, massaging his back gently as he  turned to face her, his small grin mirroring hers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Their  eyes met, and so began the most childishly awkward moment that Midori  had experienced since being asked out by a cute, stupid boy during  her final year in junior high. It lasted exactly seven seconds,  during which Midori kept her eyes locked onto Reito’s, wanting  desperately to look away but not quite knowing how.  His eyes were  gentle, sparkling with a sort of <em>oh, Midori, </em>humor that she  didn’t quite appreciate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  problem, she would later speculate, was that she wanted to thank him,  but at the same time, she wanted his egotistical, womanizing face out  of hers.  The second problem was that he was neither egotistical nor  womanizing, and she knew this quite well, and understood that she had  made this description of him up on the spot. She did not want to  admit this to herself at the moment, because that would feel a lot  like letting her defenses down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  don’t like him like I liked the professor.  And he’s looking at  me like I do.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  bothered Midori a whole hell of a lot less than she wanted to admit,  and that bothered a whole hell of a lot more than she could  adequately explain to any sort of guidance counselor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then  the moment passed, and Reito shifted his focus to the wall behind and  to the left of Midori’s head, his smile becoming a little less  genuine, his eyes becoming a little less affectionate.  “I’ll  just wait outside,” he said quietly. “If you need anything, just  shout.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>He  almost seems angry.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Can  you really be surprised at that?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  will,” Midori nodded, and then said, with as big of a smile as she  could force onto her face, “Thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  seemed to lighten his mood a lot. He grinned back, and nodded.  “I’ll  be outside.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then he  was gone, and Minoru was looking at Midori with a kind of resigned  apprehension: <em>Hurry up and shoot me, I don’t have all day. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  almost seemed unnecessary, then, for Midori to say, “This is going  to hurt,” but she did anyway, her voice manically cheery as she  unrolled a length of medical tape that she produced from some pocket  that he couldn’t see. “A lot.” Minoru didn’t particularly  trust that voice—it was the voice of somebody who enjoyed every bit  of their work, a voice that did not fit well on nurses, dentists, or  lawyers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It also  did not fit well on somebody about to re-set your dislocated wrist.  He was starting to have second thoughts about the whole endeavor—a  lot of them, at that; as it was, he couldn’t feel his wrist, but it  didn’t really hurt, either.  He wasn’t any particular fan of  agonizing pain, so he felt at that moment that he would have been  more than happy to just live and let live.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori’s  left hand was gripping Minoru’s dislocated hand firmly, holding it  as though she was about to shake it, and she held his wrist loosely  in her right.  Apparently, her nurse friend had told her that her  best shot at not irrevocably fucking his joint up was to make sure  she didn’t touch the vein as she did it, which meant she would have  to squeeze his wrist back together with one hand.  Gently, unless it  resisted.  Then she was apparently to use all her strength, but do so  gently.  Always gently.   Also, she had told Midori that it was going  to hurt a lot.  Him, not her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Grit  your teeth, buddy,” she said.  “Count of three, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Could  you wait just a second?” Minoru interrupted, his stomach churning  suddenly with anticipation of the pain he was about to endure. <em>She’s  going to do it on one anyway. Nurses that enjoy their work always  pull shit like that.</em> “I’d like to get a last glimpse of the  world before you—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori’s  hand clenched, a lot less gently than she’d intended, and the wave  of sharp, burning pain that followed didn’t so much shoot through  Minoru as rip his nerves out, bunch them up, and take a nice big bite  out of them.  He screamed—a little higher-pitched than Midori would  have thought was possible from somebody with a voice as mid-ranged as  his—and collapsed, slumped over practically on top of her as his  voice cut out without warning.  At the same time, his hand clenched  up into a tight fist.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  felt a pang of shock sweep through her where the panic should have  been, and she cursed to hserself. <em>Oh, shit, </em>she thought with  a remarkable sense of calm.<em> I must have pinched the vein even  worse. </em>She shouted, “Help me!” and immediately put her hand  to his neck, trying to feel for a pulse.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No,  not the neck. Check his wrist.  If you really did pinch his nerve,  you won’t be able to feel his pulse there. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  door opened almost immediately, and a second later, Reito knelt down  next to her, his face calm but his eyes urgent.  “What happened to  him?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>He’s  asking, </em>what did you do to him? <em>You fucked up, that’s what  happened to him.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  little voice in the back of her head. Insecurity. That thing she had  just beaten down.<br />
      <em>You’re  going to kill him.<br />
        Fuck  you.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t know.”  She shook her head to clear it of that stupid <em>fucking </em>insecurity. “I’m not sure.  I set his wrist, and  he just collapsed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  gripped his forearm, about a quarter of the way up from his wrist,  and dug her finger, a little more powerfully than she’d probably  intended, into the area between his tendon and his muscle, feeling a  soft, gentle pulse on her fingertip.  Immediately, some of her worry  dissolved as she began to track his heartbeat as a little slow, but  certainly present.  She started moving her finger lower, tracking the  vein down his wrist, as Reito pulled Minoru’s limp form off of her  lap; at the base of the forearm, the pulse vanished.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  pinched the vein. </em>The bottom dropped out of her stomach, and she  looked up at Reito, her eyes wide.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  pinched the vein?” he asked unnecessarily; she wished he hadn’t,  but answered him anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  pinched the vein.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  have no fucking idea. I must have pinched it with the bone, so we  have to loosen it.” <em>Think. Think. THINK. You’re not a nurse,  but you lived with one for years. </em>Minoru’s hand was starting  to turn an ugly shade of blue that made Reito’s eyes widen a bit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  she had once said to Youko came to mind immediately, but oddly  enough, it had nothing to do with nursing or veins or anything: <em>Sometimes, things just fall into place, but a lot of the time,  they fall right on top of something important. Never trust anything  to work itself out on its own.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At  this, as if almost by instinct, she started rubbing at the vein, at  the tendons around it, and the fist his hand had clenched so  powerfully into started to loosen, and with it, his tendons.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In spite  of her relationship with Youko, it was Reito who spotted first what  was going on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“His  hand is starting to turn a little less blue,” he said quietly.  Midori looked down at his hand and realized that Reito was right.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s  too tight.  His hand is too tight, and it’s cutting off the  circulation to a vein that’s already crowded.<br />
  Things  just fall into place, right on top of something.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  was by no means a stupid woman.  She was, in fact, one of the  brightest women in the Archaeology department; she was twenty-four  and had been most of the way through graduate school when she was  expelled; she was clever and she had a keen ability to observe a  puzzle as a series of little pieces, and to see just where they  should fall.  Her ability to synthesize information from little clues  and hints was near-nigh legendary among the other Masters’  candidates in the Archaeology department at Tokyo University; it was  what made her good at her job.  It was what had led her so close to  the truth; to the truth at Fuuka Gakuen that had kept Mai alive in  the end.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She had  also spent many, many nights helping Youko study diagrams of the  human anatomy, and had subsequently learned almost as much as her  roommate had.  She knew fairly well the structure of veins and  tendons, bones and nerves.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe,  if this worked, she could stop paying Youko back for puking on her  one night when she was holding up a diagram of a nerve structure for  her to study for a midterm the next day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Reito,”  she said urgently, “you know that tendon on your forearm that moves  whenever you move your hand?” she pointed it out on her own arm,  just next to the vein she’d pinched.  “Dig your finger under it  as hard as you can.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He did  what she asked without questioning it; this tugged more than it  probably should have at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  grabbed his wrist, and without a second thought, squeezed it again.  Reito frowned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  feel like I’m blocking something from moving.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  are,” she said. “Now, without moving your hand, try and unclench  his fist.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  did, and the fist broke into a flat palm with very little effort.  Color started to return to the hand almost immediately, and Midori  smiled, let a breath out. “Lucky,” she admitted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Was  it?” Reito was visibly relieved; his face was actually sweating a  little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think so,” she said quietly. “Lucky that I didn’t just squish  the vein in between his two pieces of wrist. <em>Lucky that</em> squeezing his wrist a second time actually did something. <em>Lucky  that</em> a lot of things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  think so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  do.” She did; bones liked to be where they were supposed to be, but  they couldn’t just be expected to go there on their own. Sometimes  it took a gentle push.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did  he just pass out from the shock?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  got no idea,” Midori shrugged. “I think he’s okay, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was silence for a moment between them.  Once again, an awkward moment  between the two of them, but this time the moment began to stretch  itself out, able to easily fill the space of a minute.  Two minutes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  feel as though something at this moment is missing. </em>Both Midori  and Reito thought this as one, neither of them aware of the  simultaneity of the event.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  thought what was missing might have something to do with her, but  Reito was certain of what the two of them lacked at that moment. <em>Midori is missing a willingness to let her guard down around  anybody, even</em> <em>just to say, “boy, am I relieved that </em>that’s <em>over.  She’s more tense than she was when Minoru’s hand was  about to explode. What is she afraid of?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  knew the answer to this almost offhand, of course. She was afraid of  him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But that  didn’t explain her tension. Nor did it explain why the two of them  were still sitting on the floor, trying to count the grains of wood  on the walls.  That didn’t explain why Reito could practically  taste Midori’s discomfort: Not the discomfort that a little girl  felt around her creepy uncle Kenichi, but the discomfort that a woman  felt around the boy that she’d dumped and then wanted back,  privately: That unwillingness to do anything, and that total  commitment to stubbornly, miserably resist any advances he made on  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  I’m not her ex-anything. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Carefully,  oh-so-carefully, Reito turned his head so that he could see Midori in  his peripheral vision, found her still counting grains, her eyes calm  and unfocused.  She was absently stroking Minoru’s head; Minoru who  had entered their world not three hours ago; Minoru who was now  tearing their nice, comfortable (if moderately dramatic) vacation  into carefully-shredded scrap.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  wasn’t a writer, nor was he a poet, but he was a student, and he  felt that he could fill up a good five-paragraph essay talking about  how Midori looked right at that moment: Her red hair, hair that was  normally elaborately put up in an extravagant ponytail, now draped  around her shoulders, framing her sharp, determined face.  About how…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Upon  another moment’s reflection, mostly to do with just how un-romantic  five-paragraph essays really were and how uncreative they became  towards paragraph four, Reito decided to settle with <em>she looks  really beautiful. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> And, </em>he decided upon another moment’s consideration, <em>she may be  uncomfortable here, but I’m not. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m  not at all.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  was close enough to the truth for Reito.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,  Midori,” he said quietly, ending their unspoken grain-counting  competition by twisting his head to look at her nonchalantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked up, startled, and caught his eye.  “Mm?”  Her eyes were a  bit wide; his tone was soft and gentle, and his eyes were clear and  confident as they met hers. Her stomach did a little flip, and she  wasn’t sure if she wanted to vomit or sing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Oh,  shit.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  were perhaps two people in the world who could have taken the near  death of a complete stranger by wrist-dislocation induced shock and  turned it into a topic of small talk about a mutual acquaintance,  especially in a situation about a nanometer away from being romantic,  but one of them was most certainly Reito Kanzaki:  “I  suppose you  and Youko haven’t seen anything quite this interesting since grad  school, and even then, it probably had something to do with a class.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Words  could not convey Midori’s shock. <em>Small talk.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  son of a bitch is making </em>small talk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s  because you’re uncomfortable, and he knows it. </em>Something about  being understood quite so thoroughly bothered Midori—it bothered  her a lot.  “I guess not.”  Her tone was clipped, at best, which  didn’t surprise Reito in the slightest. “Huh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even so,  she had shifted herself around to face him without realizing it. That  could have been interpreted a lot of ways, all of which Reito  catalogued and dismissed in the space of about a second.   Instead,  he just smiled at her.  “Are you feeling any better?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Than  what?” she said; it was a knee-jerk reaction that she found herself  cursing a moment after she said it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Than  before. You seemed very troubled back in Goza.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  say </em>troubled <em>like I </em>didn’t <em>cuss you out. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You’re  acting again. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  she admitted with some difficulty.  And then, with less difficulty, a  lot less than she’d have expected: “I am.  Thank you.”   And  oddly enough, she meant it. Even the last part.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then,”  he said, his voice just as light as it had been a moment ago but his  words infinitely more serious, “would you like to go back to Goza  later tonight, if the situation allows?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  froze for a moment, every muscle in her body tensing at once as her  eyes widened a little bit, more in panic than in shock; not that she  hadn’t been expecting this, only that she had absolutely no idea  what to say now that it was upon her; a few hours ago, she’d have  been able to cuss him out and leave.  She couldn’t do that now, if  only out of sheer<br />
      <em>affection</em><br />
  gratitude—for  his virtually unfaltering devotion to not letting up on her with his  non-advances in spite of her unfaltering bitchery—which said  nothing of her lighter mood; the anger that had let her do that had  bled out of her earlier, and she wasn’t really sure if she could  summon that kind of energy again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t allow herself to stutter, to utter some series of incoherent  syllables while her mind grappled violently with the simple <em>yes-no </em>dichotomy; she was no longer an awkward teenager as she once was.   She was twenty fucking four years old, and damned if she was going  to let some—admittedly handsome—nineteen year old reduce her to a  puddle of monosyllabic goo.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the  end, it came down to one simple thing holding her back: <em>If you  decide to do this with him, you have to really do it. There will be  no pussyfooting around.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>He’s  still a dick.<br />
  And I  still don’t like him like that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  she knew he deserved better, and that aside, she wondered how much  longer she would be able to tell herself that before she had to  address whatever was really in her heart, be it good or bad.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Then,  I guess you deserve this. </em>“Fine,” she said. “But on my  terms.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito’s  mask was perfect; he didn’t even crack a grin at his sudden,  unexpected victory.  “Name them,” he said smoothly; if there was  a negotiation afoot, he didn’t acknowledge it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  funny shit. No talking about the professor.” Her voice barely even  cracked when she said that.  That alone merited at least one drink.  “And we get somebody to drive us home, and not because I don’t  trust you to not get yourself as shitfaced as I undoubtedly will.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  because you don’t trust me when you’re drunk, </em>Reito thought. <em>That’s fair.  I don’t trust me when you’re drunk, either. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ironically,  their mutual lack of trust in Reito had nothing to do with the first  condition and everything to do with the second.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not that  Midori thought that Reito wouldn’t take advantage of her when she  was plastered—she was quite egotistical enough to think that he  would. This, she had found, was true for at least four fifths of the  male population; no reason it wouldn’t be true for him.  She had no  solid evidence, but she would, she supposed, shortly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">More  silence. <em>Theme of the hour with the two of us, </em>Midori thought  a touch sardonically. <em>What a promising friendship this looks to  become.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before  it could turn into something deafening, though, the thing she whose  forehead she had been idly stroking, the limp, lifeless thing whose  warmth she had been subconsciously relying on, spoke:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  wonderful that you two are on good terms again; I’m glad,” as  Minoru said it, Midori jumped in shock—she didn’t see Reito’s  reaction, so she assumed, mostly for the sake of her pride, that he  was also scared witless, “really, I am.  But you, Reito,” it was  a testament to Minoru’s sharp memory that he remembered this boy’s  name when it hadn’t been mentioned any more specifically than in  passing, “could you get off my leg before she has to crush that in  her fist too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  moved without acknowledging that he’d done anything wrong in the  first place, and without any sort of sheepishness. <em>That boy is a  smooth operator, </em>Minoru understood immediately as he tested out  first his leg, rolling his foot and tensing his calf and thigh  muscles, and then his hand, moving his fingers slowly.  The latter  action hurt a little, and he felt a dull ache immediately flood the  appendage; he understood that he’d probably have trouble with the  hand until he saw a proper doctor about it, but for the time being he  could use it for simple things without too much trouble.  He could  probably even snipe with it—he had once known a sniper with  horrible arthritis in his non-trigger hand.  If that bastard could do  it, he could do it, and eat a banana doing it out of spite. He hadn’t  liked that man.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  awake,” Midori observed helpfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  smiled a little too charmingly as he replied, “If that’s not  true, this is probably the most pleasant state of unconsciousness  I’ve ever experienced.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  retrospect, he said it out of instinct rather than any specific  attraction to Midori. That was not to say that the attraction wasn’t  there; she was a very pretty girl.  Rather that he sort of recognized  that he didn’t know this girl, and she didn’t seem like the type  to sleep with a man twice her age when she had just been  flirt-angsting with another younger, handsomer boy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nonetheless,  she smiled appreciatively.  “Thank you,” she said; her voice  matched her grin.  This didn’t baffle Minoru or Reito nearly as  much as it would have baffled most males their age. <em>She looks to  me, </em>Minoru observed, <em>like a woman who just doesn’t get told  she’s pretty nearly often enough. </em>He’d met a few of those,  and he always told them they were pretty, and there ended their  contact. He tended to like them too much to bed them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  simply thought Minoru had said the right thing at the right time.  Neither of them were particularly wrong.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  that, Minoru thanked Midori again.  Midori just grinned and threw a  wisecrack his way, which he fielded with grace befitting of a mildly  disinterested forty year old.  After that, he left, with a promise to  return later.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Because  as much as he would have liked to stay and chat with Midori, he  understood that he needed to know <em>why </em>he was being targeted,  and he needed to know before the next Foul Underling came to try and  take his head off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before  he left the cabin, though, he spotted his backpack resting on a wall;  he opened it, spotted everything intact inside, including a Beretta  M9 pistol and a holster with several spare clips.  This made him a  very happy man indeed, and he wondered how his karma had ever gotten  so good as he strapped the pistol to his waist.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As he  tried to holster his backpack with his bad hand, earning him a stab  of pain, he remembered: It hadn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even so,  he pressed valiantly forward and started hiking towards his first  instinct, his old sniping position on the hill overlooking their  cabin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even so.</span></p>
