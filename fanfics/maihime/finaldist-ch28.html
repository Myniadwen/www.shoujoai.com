<p><em>Tap tap tap. Tap tap tap. </em></p>
<p>Russet colored eyes  fluttered open to stare accusingly at the offending foot that had  awakened the Graceful Amethyst from her light slumber before they  slowly closed once again. A sigh resonated from the chest of the woman  sitting in the seat next to the tranquil owner of those ruby orbs, and  it was that, more so than the incessant tapping, that finally caused  her to speak.</p>
<p>“You seem nervous.”</p>
<p>It was a simple statement. Blunt, to the point, and as a result, the young Gakuenchou-in-training groaned deeply.</p>
<p>Turning  in her seat, Natsuki looked at Shizuru’s placid features with slight  envy. “I just…What am I supposed to say?” she asked.</p>
<p>The question  was directed more at the forces of the universe than her tawny-haired  friend, but the older woman mustered a response anyway.</p>
<p>“It’s your mother, Natsuki. Just tell her the truth.”</p>
<p>“You  don’t understand my mother, though,” the Vedelian whined as she shifted  in her seat to face forward again, “It’s not that simple.”</p>
<p>“It isn’t?” Shizuru pressed, eyes still closed.</p>
<p>“No.”  A pause, “It’s just, my mom and I had this plan—a promise really—that  when the war ended, we would be the ones to get Vedel up and running  again—“</p>
<p>“Mh.”</p>
<p>“—And I just feel like…like I’m going back on that promise, you know, by taking the position at Garderobe.”</p>
<p>“What  does that have to do with your mother though? That sounds more like  your feelings on the matter,” the Column remarked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“She’s going to feel the same way. Like I’m betraying our country. <em>Her</em> <em>trust</em>,”  Natsuki replied before burying her face in her palms. “I don’t know if  I can face that disappointment,” was the muffled conclusion.</p>
<p>At  that, Shizuru finally opened her eyes, and after taking a moment to  study her sulking companion, she placed a gentle hand on Natsuki’s  knee. “You were always one so willing to please, weren’t you?” she  commented with a chuckle, “Do you not think that your mother will be  proud of you? Supportive of your decision?”</p>
<p>Dropping her hands  into her lap, Natsuki leaned her head back against the soft cushioning  of her chair, eyes cast to the ceiling, “I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“I  think,” the Column began, taking one of the younger girl’s hands in her  own, “that if you are honest with your mother, that she cannot be angry  with you. It’s <em>your </em>life, Natsuki. <em>Your</em> choice. If she were to deny you that freedom, would she not be contradicting her own beliefs?”</p>
<p>Turning  her head, Natsuki’s viridian eyes met Shizuru’s as her clasped hand  tightened. “I don’t want to let her down,” came the quiet, honest  response.</p>
<p>“You won’t be,” Shizuru assured, returning the squeeze of their interlocked fingers.</p>
<p>“I hope you’re right.”</p>
<hr />
<p>An  unexpected visit, Natsuki had thought, would give her an upper hand in  the discussion that was soon to come with her mother, and when she and  Shizuru had stepped off of the plane onto Vedelian soil, they had  indeed dodged a return ceremony of any form or fashion. What the  younger girl had not considered in her tactical plan, however, was her  near celebrity status since the war had ended. She possessed both a  recognizable name and face, the fact that she and her mother shared so  many common features not helping in the matter, so what would have been  no surprise to one familiar with their own fame came as quite a shock  to Vedel native and her baffled companion.</p>
<p>As they made their way  through the Seris airport, the two women were bombarded by fellow  travelers and airport workers alike. Whispered words of, <em>‘That’s Natsuki Kruger!’ </em>or <em>‘Who’s that woman she’s with?’ </em>amongst  many other curious phrases reached their alert ears as they pushed  their way through the mounting crowd, making sure to stay near one  another so they wouldn’t be separated. Thankfully, airport security had  reacted to the circulating activity, and a handful of guards had  offered to escort them out of the building. Both Natsuki and Shizuru  welcomed the assistance with graciousness, as the  normally-short-turned-long trek across the building commenced.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t expecting <em>this</em>,” Natsuki managed to comment now that some breathing room from the masses was obtained.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know Natsuki was so popular,” Shizuru retorted back as she took a possessive step closer to her friend.</p>
<p>“Neither  did I,” the raven-haired Otome replied as the small entourage managed  to slip through another door, “This is just ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“Do we even know where we’re headed—“</p>
<p>“There’s  a car outside waiting to take you to the courthouse,” one of the guards  interrupted the Column, his gaze locked forward, “A message has already  been sent to Senator Kruger about your arrival.”</p>
<p>“I-I see,” Natsuki muttered before her expression soured. “So much for coming in unannounced,” she mumbled agitatedly.</p>
<p>Leaning  in closer, Shizuru playfully whispered into the younger girl’s ear,  “You know, I could always materialize and fly us out of here myself…”</p>
<p>With  a twinkle in her emerald eyes, Natsuki smiled for the first time since  landing in her homeland, an amused chuckle actually managing to crack  her somber expression as they continued their journey through the swarm  of curious bystanders.</p>
