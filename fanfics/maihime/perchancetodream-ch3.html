<a href="../maihime/perchancetodream-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><p>Shizuru’s Trap</p><hr><i>Ugh,
I can be such an idiot sometimes. I really should have thrown out
that idea of asking you to help me study for my Geometry quiz, but
no, I had to have an excuse to get together with you tomorrow. I know
you would have happily </i><i>gotten
together with me for no other reason than to be with me, but I
couldn’t just ask that. It was embarrassing, I guess, though it
really shouldn’t be.</i></p></p><p><i>So
instead of mildly embarrassing myself, I ended up being dishonest
with you. Well, it’s not like I actually lied. All I really said
was that I had a quiz Friday, and it would be nice if you could help
me study for it. That’s true, but it’s still not being completely
honest. Saying it like that implies that I need your help with
studying, when I’m really just using this as a thin excuse to see
you.</i></p><p><i>I
kind of wish you’d been able to see through that excuse and had
given me a coy tease about it. But from all I could tell, you
believed me. I’m glad you trust me so much, Shizuru, and I really
wish I weren’t taking advantage of it like this. I should really
just call you up and explain that I don’t need your help, and I
just wanted to see you, but I don’t have the courage. Why do I have
to be such a coward when it comes to things like this?</i></p><p><i>I’m
sorry, Shizuru. I’ll try to come clean as soon as I see you
tomorrow. Hopefully it’ll be easier if I don’t have to call you
up first to do it. I’m sure you’ll come up with some big tease or
“punishment” for me, but I deserve it. Maybe I’m making too big
a deal out of this, though. I know you won’t really care if I tell
you the truth about this, and even if you found out on your own that
I wasn’t completely honest it probably wouldn’t bother you. But I
don’t know, it just doesn’t sit right with me. Probably just me
being silly again. Don’t worry too much about it.</i></p></p><hr>Something
immediately struck Natsuki as wrong when she walked into Shizuru’s
house. Shizuru hadn’t come to the door for her when she’d rung
the doorbell, only yelling out to tell her it was unlocked and she
could come in to meet her in the kitchen, but there didn’t seem to
be anything wrong with that. It seemed just like something Shizuru
would do to set her up for a surprise hug as she walked through the
door. <i>Oh. That’s probably it then.
I must have gotten so used to her jumping me when I got home that it
seems wrong when she doesn’t.</i></p></p><p>The
realization didn’t do much to soothe Natsuki’s feeling of unease,
though. She shifted awkwardly in her spot by the door, unsure of what
she wanted. She could admit to herself that she enjoyed hugging
Shizuru, but could she really start to miss them? No, she was
stronger than that. Right? Natsuki shook her head to try to rid
herself of those thoughts, and she kicked her shoes off and headed to
Shizuru’s kitchen.</p><p><i>Alright,
I have to confess to her now,</i>

Natsuki thought as she entered the kitchen. <i>I
have to… oh boy…</i> Natsuki’s
thoughts trailed off as she passed the doorway and caught sight of
Shizuru. She was sitting at the table, across from Natsuki, calmly
sipping a cup of tea, but none of that was what had surprised the
other girl. Shizuru had apparently really gotten into this tutoring
thing, as she’d dressed up in her old kaichou uniform with the
added accessory of a pair of glasses, making her look quite
professorial. In front of her, she had out a geometry textbook, some
paper, pencils, and a calculator.</p><p><i>Damn
it, why do you have to make this confession so difficult, Shizuru?
Did you figure it out and decide to do this just to torture me? Well
fine, two can play at that game then. If you really want to play
teacher, I’ll play student for you and we’ll see who blinks
first.</i> Natsuki covered up her racing
thoughts with a shy smile as she pulled a chair out and sat down
across from Shizuru. “Er… hi, Shizuru,” she said.</p><p>“Ara?”
Shizuru said, raising an eyebrow. Her tone of voice seemed a bit
different from usual, as if she were putting on a “teacher”
accent on top of her usual voice. “It certainly took Natsuki a
while to make it to the kitchen. Did she get lost on the way here?”</p><p>“Baka,”
Natsuki spat with a joking glare. “You can see the door to the
kitchen from the entrance. There was nothing to find.”</p><p>Shizuru’s
other eyebrow raised to join its partner. “Ara ara, is that any way
to talk to your teacher? I should punish you for your insolence.”</p><p>Natsuki
scrambled to recover. She didn’t want to even start thinking about
what Shizuru might have in mind for a punishment. “I’m sorry.
Please forgive me, Fujino-sensei,” Natsuki said hastily as she
stood up to take a bow before Shizuru.</p><p>“Hmm,
well I guess I can let you off with a warning this one time,”
Shizuru said, allowing her eyebrows to relax. “You may take a seat,
Kuga-san.” As Natsuki did so, Shizuru picked up the first sheet of
paper from her stack, turned it around, and handed it to her. “Let’s
start with simple shape identification, shall we? I’ve drawn out
six quadrilaterals for you here. For each of them, I want you to give
me the most specific type it fits into. If you have some trouble
here, then we can work further on this area.”</p><p>“Alright,”
Natsuki said as she took the piece of paper. The shapes on it were
hand-drawn, but they might as well have been printed for how precise
Shizuru’s drawings were. Of course, by this point, it was hardly a
surprise from her. She’d have to make a concerted effort if she
wished to be sloppy in anything. Natsuki went over the figures one by
one, leaving an extra pause between each identification to make it
seem like she had to think a bit about it. “Let’s see, that’s a
square obviously, and a rectangle there… a trapezoid…
parallelogram… a kite, and a rhombus.”</p><p>Natsuki
put a hopeful look on her face as she looked up at Shizuru, finding a
surprised but proud grin on her face. “Very good, Kuga-san,” she
said. “Particularly about catching the kite. My teacher never
bothered with them when I took geometry, and then later sprung them
on us in the quiz.” Shizuru then reached up and removed her
glasses. After she placed them down on the table, she rubbed her eyes
for a moment. She then whispered to Natsuki in her regular voice,
“These things give me a headache anyways. I haven’t really needed
them since I got laser surgery a couple years ago.”</p><p>“Aha,”
Natsuki said with a little chuckle. “Don’t worry, you still look
quite professional without them.”</p><p>“Good,”
Shizuru said. She straightened up and reverted back to her teacher
voice. “Now, let’s try something a bit more difficult.” She
passed the next sheet of paper to Natsuki, along with a pencil and
the calculator. “Calculate the length of the third leg of this
triangle.”</p><p>With
a nod to Shizuru, Natsuki took a look at the paper. A right triangle
was drawn on it, with the lengths of the hypotenuse and one of the
legs written in. <i>Well, this is simple
enough,</i> Natsuki thought to herself.<i>But if I do too well, Shizuru might
figure out that I don’t really need her help if she hasn’t
already. Let’s see, what might be a likely mistake here…? </i>After
a few minutes of thought in coming up with a good mistake, Natsuki
wrote down some equations and used the calculator to get her answer.
“Alright, Shizuru,” she said as she stared at her calculator.
“I’m getting 29.84 blah blah, more decimals, for my answer.”</p><p>Shizuru
put on a disappointed expression, which had a hint of her pout in it,
as if she were begging Natsuki to do better. “I’m sorry, Natsuki,
but that’s not correct. Can I see what you did so I can figure out
where the problem is?” With a nod and a disappointed expression of
her own, Natsuki handed the paper to Shizuru. “Ah, I see here. To
get the answer here, you have to subtract the square of the leg’s
length, not add it.”</p><p>“Oh?
But I thought the rule was, ‘The sum of the squares of the lengths
of any two sides of a right triangle is equal to the square of the
remaining side,’” Natsuki said, misquoting the law to justify her
mistake.</p><p>“Ah,
not quite,” Shizuru said, a small grin forming on her face as she
discovered Natsuki’s error. “It’s the sum of the squares of the
shorter two sides, the leg, which equals the square of the longest
side, the hypotenuse.” Natsuki nodded at this, and Shizuru
continued. “Think about it, this only really works for the longer
side. You can prove that adding squares this way always gets a larger
result.”</p><p>“Ah,
okay, I see,” Natsuki said, giving Shizuru a smile. “I’ll keep
that in mind, thanks.” Shizuru smiled back at her and… nothing.
She sat there waiting expectantly for something for over a minute,
until Natsuki finally relented and asked in exasperation, “What are
you waiting for, Shizuru?”</p><p>Shizuru
cocked an eyebrow quizzically. “Ara? Didn’t Natsuki get the rules
for our tutoring session?”</p><p>“Rules?
What rules?” <i>Okay, she’s
definitely playing some game here, but what is it?</i></p><p>“Oh,
I guess you haven’t checked your mail yet today,” Shizuru said, a
mischievous glint in her eye hinting that it probably wouldn’t be
in the mail in any case. “But ignorance of the rules is no excuse.
You owe me one article of clothing for getting a question wrong.”</p><p>“What!?”
A blush rose to Natsuki’s face as she figured out Shizuru’s game.
Thoughts telling her that as she knew geometry, she had nothing to
worry about warred in her mind with the realization of how dirty
Shizuru’s mind could secretly be. A wave of nervous shivers coursed
through her body as she started to worry about what else Shizuru
might think up.</p><p>“Ara,
but those are the rules,” Shizuru said, putting on her best pout
and puppy-dog eyes. “When you got the last question right, I took
off my glasses, so now it’s your turn. Are you really going to make
your girlfriend spend a week in torture waiting to pleasure you back
without even giving her the slightest chance at some fun in the
meantime? Ikezu.” Shizuru punctuated this with a sad sniff.</p><p>Pain
rushed through Natsuki’s chest at seeing Shizuru like this. She’d
figured at first it was mostly an act, but her words made it seem
like she might actually be serious about the ‘spending a week in
torture’ part. With a sigh, Natsuki gave in. “You could have just
told me you were feeling like this, Shizuru,” she said, making sure
her tone of voice would make it clear she was relenting.</p><p>Shizuru
immediately perked up, though Natsuki noticed a hint of moisture in
her eyes as the light flashed across them. “But that wouldn’t be
so fun!” she said with a giggle. “Now come on, I want to see my
Natsuki!”</p><p>With
a sigh, Natsuki scooted her chair back and reached down. She peeled
off a sock and brought it back up to hand to Shizuru. “Satisfied?”
she said.</p><p>“Very,”
Shizuru took Natsuki’s sock with a grin, carefully placing it on
the counter behind her. “Shall we continue?”</p><p>“Er,
a few questions first,” Natsuki said. “Since I never got the
rules, would you mind briefing me a little?”</p><p>“Of
course,” Shizuru said, a devious smile forming on her face.</p><p><i>How
do I know I’m going to dread these rules, even if I win?</i>

Natsuki thought. “Okay, first of all… how far does this go?”</p><p>“All
the way,” Shizuru said simply. As soon as the thought that one of
them would have to end up naked caused a blush to form in Natsuki’s
face, Shizuru added, “And then a little further,” causing
Natsuki’s face to quickly turn purple. “At the end, the winner
gets to do what they’d like to with the loser’s body.”</p><p>Natsuki
sunk into her seat as she brought up her hands to try to cover her
blush. <i>Damn it Shizuru. You’ve got
this all planned out, haven’t you? However this ends up, you’re
going to win, aren’t you? And I’m… I’m… ugh, I’m really
not ready for my first time to be tonight. I’ll have to “win,”
but would you really make me go through with it if I lost?</i></p><p>“Shizuru…”
Natsuki said hesitantly, allowing her eyes to peak above her hands
just a little. “If you win… are you really going to do this
today?”</p><p>Shizuru
gave Natsuki a smile that made her blush and fear fade in an instant.
There was no need for her to say anything beyond that reassurance,
but she spoke nonetheless. “I would never make Natsuki do something
she wasn’t ready for,” Shizuru said. “If I win, you can just
owe me for later, okay?”</p><p>“Thank
you, Shizuru,” Natsuki said, as she sighed with relief and dropped
her hands. <i>Good to know she’s still
considerate of my wishes. Maybe I’ll have to reward her for that
when this is over… Gah! What am I thinking? Er… Well, it’s not
like I haven’t already done that to her…</i>
Natsuki shook her head vigorously to try to stop the rising blush,
but this only resulted in her gaining an amused chuckle from Shizuru
and her blush getting even worse as she was found out. “Can we just
get back to the math?” she grumbled.</p><p>“Ara,
is Natsuki that anxious to get rid of the rest of her clothes?”
Shizuru said, barely repressing her laughter through this tease.</p><p>“Baka,”
Natsuki said. “I’m that anxious to rid <i>you</i>
of <i>your</i>

clothes!” Natsuki let a smile creep onto her face as her tease hit
home and a pink tinge formed in Shizuru’s cheeks. <i>Yes!
I’ve finally managed to purposefully get her to blush! You’re
mine now, Shizuru.</i></p><p>“Perhaps
it’s best we get back to the math…” Shizuru said, and she
handed the next paper to Natsuki, who was still allowing herself to
grin like an idiot over her victory. Shizuru gave a glare to try to
dissuade her, but Natsuki would have none of it.</p><p>As
the tutoring session progressed, Natsuki found herself surprised with
just how many little pieces Shizuru managed to find on her Kaichou
uniform which she declared each counted as an article of clothing.
She’d even taken to wearing her shoes inside to add to Natsuki’s
workload in disrobing her; something Natsuki had never known her to
do before. She’d really put forth an effort to maximize her chance
of winning, and it was almost a shame that it would be all for naught
in the end. Mostly, though, Natsuki decided to let herself be proud
that she was able to force Shizuru to fall into her own trap.</p><p>The
force of her pride started to waver, however, when it became time for
one of them to have to show some real skin. Both of them were down to
just their shirts, shorts, and underwear, courtesy of some faked
mistakes on Natsuki’s part to keep the game a bit interesting.
Natsuki’s guilt over the fact that her little deception was leading
her to win started to war with her modesty. It was a choice between
revealing herself to Shizuru or taking advantage of the situation to
make Shizuru reveal herself.</p><p>Natsuki
tried to convince herself with the fact that she’d already seen all
there was to see of Shizuru, and shown herself in just her underwear
to Shizuru in the process, but it wasn’t quite working. Her modesty
was still up in full force, and it didn’t show any sign of wavering
without some physical contact from Shizuru to help get her in the
mood. <i>I miss my hug…</i>
she thought with a pout. Had Shizuru denied her that on purpose to
make her more uncomfortable?</p><p>But
could Shizuru have even figured that out yet? It wasn’t until just
a minute ago that it had popped into Natsuki’s mind that it was the
physical contact she was missing to get into the mood. No, knowing
Shizuru, she was probably trying to get her into the mood, and hoping
that the sights alone would do it. She wouldn’t purposefully try to
simultaneously push Natsuki towards an encounter and keep her away
from arousal; nothing would be served by that outside of making her
extraordinarily uncomfortable.</p><p>Of
course, even knowing that, trying to get this across to Shizuru was
quite another matter. Natsuki wished she had the courage to simply
say it, but the woman’s teasing nature scared her off – at least
until she was obviously uncomfortable enough that she could be
confident Shizuru wouldn’t be cruel enough to make her more so. But
she had to say something; she was starting to wilt under Shizuru’s
gaze as she pondered the decision of whether or not to give the
correct answer to this problem.</p><p>With
a sigh, Natsuki decided to go with a confession that was, at the
least, marginally less embarrassing to talk about. It would still
hopefully serve to get her out of this. “Shizuru,” she said,
earning a cocked eyebrow from the girl who had apparently started to
worry about how long this problem was taking her. “I don’t really
need your help on Geometry. I learned it all last year… I just
needed an excuse to see you today.”</p><p>Natsuki
broke eye contact with Shizuru as she felt a slight blush rising to
her cheeks. It was probably coming in anticipation of however Shizuru
would tease her about this. As Natsuki heard a chuckle coming from
Shizuru, it deepened in further anticipation, as she knew it was
going to be a big one.</p><p>“Ara
ara, Natsuki,” Shizuru said, a devious tone to her voice. “That’s
a very nice try, but I’m not going to let you out of this that
easily. You’re here to the end, win or lose.”</p><p>Natsuki
groaned at Shizuru’s response. How had she managed to
simultaneously tease Natsuki about this, force her to keep going, and
still somehow keep her in the dark as to whether or not she’d
already known that Natsuki didn’t need help? The woman’s ability
to tease was inhuman.</p><p>“Fine,”
Natsuki said as she slammed her pencil down on the table and looked
back up at Shizuru. “Have it your way. The area’s 28, but you
really don’t have to take anything off if you don’t want to…”</p><p>Shizuru’s
expression was unreadable as her hands dipped below the table. They
slowly – far too slowly – came back up, pulling up her blouse.
Shizuru’s bare abdomen was revealed to Natsuki first, followed soon
by the revelation that she was wearing a lacy black bra which seemed
to perfectly emphasize the swell of her breasts. Natsuki felt a
furious blush rise to her face as she brought her hands up to her
eyes to shield herself from the sight. A flicker of arousal was
trying to make itself heard in her mind, but her discomfort and
embarrassment easily overwhelmed it.</p><p>“Natsuki?”
Shizuru’s voice made Natsuki drop her hands to peek back at the
girl. Her tone was full of worry, and this showed through on her face
as well. “Are you okay? I thought you’d enjoy seeing me. You
certainly seemed to on Saturday…”</p><p><i>Damn
it. Damn it, damn it, damn it!</i>

Natsuki cursed silently to herself. She was really starting to make
Shizuru worry now, and the last thing she wanted was for her
girlfriend to start having doubts about their relationship. She
couldn’t bear letting her go through that pain again.</p><p>The
words to reassure her just weren’t coming to her, though, so
Natsuki decided to simply act on instinct. She pushed her chair back
from the table and got up. She walked around the table to the stunned
and worried Shizuru, knelt down, and wrapped her in a hug. “You
forgot to give me one of these when I came in,” she said as she
rested her head between Shizuru’s cheek and her shoulder.</p><p>Shizuru’s
bare skin was initially a bit cool, but it warmed up quickly as a
blush came to her. Her arms quickly made their way around Natsuki,
giving her the hug she’d gone far too long without. “Ara, I’m
sorry Natsuki,” Shizuru said. “I didn’t realize this meant so
much to you. Usually sight alone is enough for me.”</p><p>Natsuki
couldn’t think of anything to say in response to this, so she
simply remained in the hug. Feeling Shizuru hold her did wonders to
help ease her discomfort, and it wasn’t long before she was able to
let her mind touch on the fact that her girlfriend was about to
disrobe for her without blushing horribly. When she felt she was
sufficiently steeled to get through it, Natsuki gently backed out of
the hug and returned to her seat.</p><p>“I
think I’m good to continue now,” she said, giving Shizuru a smile
to let her know that she was alright now.</p><p>“Ara,
I think a little modification to the rules might be necessary,”
Shizuru said, moving her finger to her chin in a thinking pose. “How
about this: Whenever Natsuki gets a question right, in addition to
removing an article of clothing, I’ll allow her some intimate
contact. With each piece removed, it’ll get a bit more intimate. If
she can get the last piece off of me, she of course can have whatever
she wants. Sound good?”</p><p>Natsuki
allowed herself to chuckle lightly at Shizuru’s insight and how
she’d modified the rules for her benefit. With a smile creeping
across her face, she said, “Yeah, I think I like those rules.”</p><p>“Good,”
Shizuru said as her face lit up. “Now let’s get back to the math
before I have to punish you for looking at your sensei improperly.”</p><p>A
blush rose on Natsuki’s face as Shizuru passed her the next sheet.<i>This woman just never 
gives up…</i>
“Yes, Fujino-sensei,” she said. Natsuki inspected the sheet
Shizuru had handed to her. It was another area calculation, of
rhombus this time. A quick multiplication of the diagonals and a
division by two gave her the answer. “15. Now where’s that
intimate contact you promised me?”</p><p>Shizuru
chuckled as she stood up from the chair and walked around to Natsuki.
After her brief moment of worry, it was refreshing to see one of her
genuine smiles back on her face. She was certainly enjoying this
game, even if she knew ahead of time she was bound to lose. “How
about Natsuki starts by removing my skirt herself?” she said. She’d
made an effort to keep a steady, teasing tone to her voice, but her
control was starting to slip and let some of her internal giddiness
through.</p><p>“Of
course, Fujino-sensei,” Natsuki said, playing the role of Shizuru’s
obedient student. She threw strict obedience to the winds, however,
when she kneeled in front of Shizuru and placed her hands on her
girlfriend’s sides, above her skirt. The presence of Natsuki’s
hand right over the spot where Shizuru’s HiME mark had been
prompted a sharp gasp of pleasure and a blush from the woman.</p><p>With
a chuckle, Natsuki dragged her fingers down, eliciting another gasp
as the fingertips of her right hand once again passed over that spot.
They caught onto Shizuru’s skirt and slowly pulled it down off of
her legs, revealing a pair of lacy black panties to match her bra.
They were somewhat transparent on the sides, with a more opaque
covering for decency’s sake in the center. There was nothing
decent, however, about the spot of wetness in the center of them that
caught Natsuki’s eye.</p><p>“I
see someone’s enjoying herself,” Natsuki teased as she stood back
up to meet Shizuru’s face. A delightful pink tinge had formed in
her cheeks, but Natsuki didn’t allow herself to take a pause to
relish it, as she knew Shizuru would turn the tease back on her given
an extra second of opportunity. To keep her from doing this, Natsuki
quickly leaned in to envelop
Shizuru’s lips with her own. Her arms made their way around
Shizuru’s back, and her hands came up to hold Shizuru’s head so
she couldn’t break free to tease.</p><p>All
Shizuru was able to manage was a brief chuckle before her lips
relaxed into Natsuki’s kiss. Natsuki didn’t let her do much at
first, her own lips dominating the rhythm, enveloping Shizuru’s and
closing in repeatedly, reminding herself of a fish trying to eat
Shizuru’s mouth. When Shizuru seemed to be getting a bit put off by
not being able to do anything in response, Natsuki stayed her lips to
give her a chance to catch up.</p><p>Shizuru
started playing the same game with Natsuki’s lips for bit, though
it wasn’t long before she gave it up in favor of a more mutual
rhythm. Natsuki took this chance to try to take in as much of
Shizuru’s taste as she could, sucking on her lips when given the
opportunity and bringing out her tongue to lick along them. Her
lipstick was a quite pleasant cherry, and Natsuki was sure she could
taste a trace of green tea left over in her mouth. She felt herself
starting to fall into a haze of desire as Shizuru’s taste
registered in her mind and she thought about how she was taking in
the woman’s essence.</p><p>Shizuru
seemed to find the feeling of Natsuki’s tongue tracing along her
lips to be quite enjoyable, and Natsuki could feel her body starting
to relax in her arms. Caring arms came up around her back to cradle
her, and Shizuru’s lips opened up slowly, begging Natsuki to enter.
She eagerly obliged, slipping her tongue through the opening provided
and allowing it to sweep along its partner, which it found inside.
The taste of Shizuru was even stronger there, and a bolt of pleasure
shot down through Natsuki’s torso at experiencing it, eventually
pooling in a warmth in her nether regions.</p><p>The
thought suddenly struck Natsuki’s mind that she was likely now
making her panties as wet as Shizuru’s were, and the sudden chuckle
broke her out of the kiss. Shizuru took an extra moment to recover
from the haze and pull back, but she gave Natsuki a quizzical gaze
when she did. “Ara, now what’s so funny, Natsuki?”</p><p>Quickly
coming up with an alternative to the real reason she’d started
chuckling, Natsuki said, “Do we really have to continue this game,
Shizuru? I think we’re both quite ready enough to go on to the next
step.” Only a few minutes ago, just thinking those words would have
caused Natsuki to blush furiously. But now, Shizuru’s intimate
touch and taste had reawakened the courage she’d tapped into the
past Saturday to give her girlfriend the pleasure she so desired, and
the only thing she currently had trouble with was holding herself
back from tearing off Shizuru’s last remaining garments.</p><p>Shizuru
considered this for a moment, backing out of Natsuki’s hug and
towards her seat. “Hmm… I still kind of want to play this to the
end, but I guess we could speed things up a bit. One more question,
sudden death. Winner take all.”</p><p>“Hehe,
alright,” Natsuki said as she allowed herself to sit back down and
tried not to stare too much at the sight of Shizuru only in her
skimpy lingerie. “You’d better hope I win, though, with what I’ve
got in mind for you.”</p><p>“Don’t
worry,” Shizuru said as she sat down. “I have confidence in
Natsuki’s intelligence. But I may still give her the chance in any
case, as a favor for me letting her put off her own reward until
Friday. To keep things interesting, though, I’ve got a special
problem prepared for you.” Shizuru shuffled through the stack of
papers, eventually pulling out the one at the bottom of the stack and
giving it to Natsuki.</p><p>Natsuki
took the paper and read the question that was written out on it: “A
regular polygon has 11 sides, all of the same length, and all angles
between sides are the same. The distance from its center to any of
the corners is 5. Calculate the area.” They’d covered regular
polygons for a bit in the class she’d taken the past year, though
her summer course hadn’t even touched on them yet. Still, it would
theoretically be possible for her to get it using just the knowledge
from her class so far, though it would take some work.</p><p>It
took Natsuki a few minutes of intensive work to get through the
problem, as she tried not to let her mind drift to Shizuru and what
she wanted to do to her too much. Eventually, she got to an answer.
Part of her wanted to double check and make sure it was right so she
didn’t end up owing her body to Shizuru later, but she was just too
impatient to care anymore. “74.34 or so, now can we please get on
with this?”</p><p>“Ara
ara, Natsuki is so impatient,” Shizuru said. She then gave a
dramatic sigh. “But, she is right, so I guess she can have what she
wants now.”</p><p>A
grin split across Natsuki’s face and she eagerly eyed up her prize.
“Good. Now where’s your bedroom?”</p><p>Shizuru
pointed to the door behind her shoulder as a pink tinge spread across
her cheeks. “To the left, end of the hall.” Her voice was steady,
but her terse word choice clued Natsuki into the fact that she was
just as impatient as she’d accused Natsuki of being.</p><p>Deciding
not to keep her waiting any longer, Natsuki got up from her table and
approached Shizuru, who was just a bit slower on her rise. As soon as
Shizuru was standing, Natsuki slipped her arms over her shoulders and
pulled her in. As their lips met in a tender, barely controlled kiss,
Natsuki started pushing Shizuru backwards towards her bedroom.</p><p>The
kiss didn’t stay innocent for very long. Natsuki tried to take it
slowly and work up as she had before, but she ended up spending less
than a second working her tongue across Shizuru’s lips before they
cracked open and sucked her in. She could have held her tongue back
against Shizuru’s suction, but she didn’t have the will left in
her to take it slowly any longer.</p><p>As
Shizuru started to play with her tongue, Natsuki allowed her arms to
drift down to find the clasp of her bra. She wanted to take the
chance to explore her lover’s entire body this time. Teasing her
through the bra had been fun the last time, but the extended game had
provided enough of an elongated teasing session for both of them that
she felt comfortable sparing her lover that particular torment…
this time, at least.</p><p>Shizuru
let out a soft moan as Natsuki unhooked her bra, and she moved back
just enough so that Natsuki could slip it off her arms, where it was
dumped unceremoniously on the floor. As soon as it was off, Shizuru
wrapped her arms around Natsuki’s neck to hold her in while
Natsuki’s hands were occupied with her newly-revealed mounds.</p><p>Natsuki
resumed her kiss with her lover and allowed her hands a chance to
feel up Shizuru’s breasts. The woman had truly been blessed in this
department, and Natsuki could barely cover the entire orbs up with
her hands. She made do by rubbing and squeezing as much as she could
grip at a time while slowly working her hands around to make sure no
portion of them was left unsatisfied. Shizuru let out a throaty moan
into Natsuki’s mouth as her ministrations started to fuel her
passion.</p><p>Noticing
out of the corner of her eye that they’d made it to Shizuru’s
bedroom and Shizuru’s bed – queen sized, just perfect for the two
of them – was right behind her, Natsuki suddenly pushed her hands
out against Shizuru’s breasts. With a yelp of surprise, Shizuru
fell back onto her bed, delighting Natsuki with the cute way her
breasts jiggled when she landed.</p><p>Shizuru
gave a high-pitched giggle at Natsuki’s dominant behavior, which
Natsuki returned with a lustful grin. She bent down and gripped the
waistband of Shizuru’s panties, noticing that the center of it was
now soaked almost to the point of transparency. She slowly pulled
them off of her lover. The previous time she’d done this, she’d
kept eye contact with Shizuru so she could connect with the soul of
her girlfriend on her first time exposing her, but this time she
allowed her eyes to stick to the prize she was unveiling.</p><p>A
cleanly-trimmed tuft of chestnut hair came into view above the
waistband, and Natsuki paused her descent for a moment. She moved her
right hand up to lightly stroke through the curls, finding them to be
even softer than the mane of hair on Shizuru’s head she so adored.
She pressed her hand in a bit harder so that Shizuru could feel her
strokes, and a pleased purr from her lover let her know that the
gesture was quite appreciated.</p><p>Reluctantly
removing her hand from the mound, Natsuki returned it to Shizuru’s
waistband so she could expose the rest of her womanhood. A pair of
glistening lips quickly came into view, sending a surge of desire
down through Natsuki’s own body. Shizuru’s legs were tightly
closed to facilitate the removal of her panties, so the view wasn’t
quite as good as Natsuki would have liked, but she’d be able to get
to that soon enough. Once she was able to see all she could for the
moment, Natsuki abandoned the slow, teasing pace and quickly pulled
Shizuru’s panties down and off of her legs.</p><p>As
her legs were freed, Shizuru pulled farther up onto the bed so she
could rest her head on the pillow and Natsuki would have enough room
on the bed. Natsuki stood back up and took a chance to look over
Shizuru’s display. The sight of her girlfriend naked and willing,
splayed out on her bed stirred a fierce desire within Natsuki. “See
something you like?” Shizuru teased, having spotted the look on
Natsuki’s face.</p><p>“Do
I ever,” Natsuki said, deflecting the tease and bringing a slight
blush to Shizuru’s cheeks. The girl might not be prone to the
full-face blushes that Natsuki was, but the little ones she did get
were too cute for Natsuki to resist. She really needed to work on her
teasing so she’d be able to elicit them more reliably. Fortunately,
she had a master on hand to learn from.</p><p>But
that could wait. For now, she had a mission. The objective: make
Shizuru writhe in pleasure. To begin her mission, she crawled up onto
the bed, straddling Shizuru. As she reached her face, she caught
Shizuru’s eyes in her own and allowed herself to fall into those
deep crimson pools as her head drifted down. Her lips met her love’s
in a tender kiss, and she inhaled Shizuru’s sweet scent as she fell
into a maelstrom of all the sensations the girl provided her.</p><p>It
didn’t take long for Shizuru’s arms to find their way around
Natsuki’s back. Even in her haze of desire, Shizuru seemed to be
making an effort to help make her girlfriend comfortable, knowing
that Natsuki just couldn’t resist a good hug. Even though Natsuki
was well past the point where she needed any reassurance that she
wanted this, the sweet gesture still managed to send a wave of warmth
through her chest. She allowed herself to let out a purr against
Shizuru’s lips, while making a silent vow that she’d manage to
get that and much more back from her.</p><p>Natsuki
gently stroked her tongue across Shizuru’s lips, absorbing her
taste while requesting entry. This was quickly provided, and her
tongue immediately met its partner in crime on the other side.
Shizuru’s tongue slipped past hers and back into Natsuki’s mouth,
bringing along the sweet taste of green tea that seemed to have made
a permanent home for itself in Shizuru’s mouth.</p><p>As
her tongue danced with Shizuru’s, Natsuki shifted her weight to
allow her right hand the freedom to drift down to Shizuru’s chest
where it once again met her breast. She decided not to torture
Shizuru too much by teasing around, so she started off by giving her
nipple a good pinch. This got a sharp yelp from Shizuru which
softened into a moan as Natsuki pressed in on the nub and started
massaging the tender flesh.</p><p>Shizuru’s
yelp and moan had caused her tongue to withdraw from Natsuki’s
mouth, so the girl took this opportunity to bring her mouth down to
attend to more intimate portions of Shizuru’s body. Her right hand
released its grip on Shizuru’s breast to allow her mouth access,
while her left moved in to take care of Shizuru’s lonely right
breast. She spent only a couple seconds circling the breast with
kisses before she enveloped the nipple within her mouth. As she
sucked in on it, she used her tongue to circle the inflamed areola
and playfully flicked at the nipple. Shizuru’s breasts seemed to
have a taste all of their own, and Natsuki added it to her mental
list of all the sensations that made up Shizuru.</p><p>As
the series of moans from Shizuru let Natsuki know that she was ready
for more, she brought her right hand down to meet the sensitive spot
on Shizuru’s side. The initial contact brought out a gasp from
Shizuru, as it never failed to do. Instead of rubbing it vigorously
to drive her quickly to the heights of arousal, Natsuki lightly
covered it with her hand and stroked it with only a slight pressure.
She didn’t want her lover getting too excited before the main
course, though it might be fun sometime in the future to see just how
far she could take things with that spot.</p><p>“Oh…
Natsuki… please…” Shizuru moaned between a series of pants, and
her arms gripped down more tightly on Natsuki. Taking a quick break
from kissing her breast to take a peek at her face, Natsuki was quite
pleased to see that Shizuru’s face was now almost entirely flushed.
Her eyes were squeezed shut, and Natsuki thought she could see a hint
of moisture forming at the corners.</p><p><i>What
are you thinking about, Shizuru? Is it still that overwhelming for
you to know that we’re finally together and I’m doing all this
for you? Well, let’s see just how far we can push your emotions
while you’ve opened up…</i> Keeping
her hands lightly massaging Shizuru’s sensitive spots, Natsuki
moved her face up to hover over Shizuru’s. After a quick kiss, she
whispered to her lover, “I really love you, Shizuru, and I love
seeing you like this.”</p><p>A
soft moan came from Shizuru at this, and her cheeks flushed a deeper
shade of red. The sight of her face like this was truly arousing, and
it was all Natsuki could do to hold herself back from tearing off her
own clothes so she could ease her mounting tension. Fortunately, she
was distracted from this by the sight of what she’d been waiting to
see from Shizuru: tears leaking their way out of her eyes. With a
grin, Natsuki moved in and used her tongue to gently lap up the
tears. She added this salty taste to her mental list, leaving only
one final taste left to be explored.</p><p>With
one last tender kiss for Shizuru, Natsuki drifted down her body so
she could enjoy the main course of the evening. A disappointed moan
came from the girl as Natsuki left the reach of her arms and removed
her hands from where they’d been caressing her. When Natsuki
reached the foot of the bed, she reached her arms in between
Shizuru’s legs and pulled them apart. This seemed to break Shizuru
out of her daze a little, as she opened her eyes to look down at
Natsuki’s position, her face hovering right over her womanhood.</p><p>Natsuki
gave Shizuru a smile and a quick wink, then she let her mouth drift
down to kiss Shizuru’s more intimate set of lips. She could hear a
moan coming from Shizuru, which she was able to extend as she took
out her tongue to give her slit a nice, long lick. Shizuru’s legs
opened even wider at this contact, and with further prodding from
Natsuki’s tongue, her lips split apart to their precious contents,
much like a flower blooming.</p><p><i>Here
goes,</i> Natsuki thought to herself as
she plunged in to explore Shizuru’s center with her tongue. She
lapped up the juices that were now gushing from Shizuru’s depths,
reveling in their sweet taste. As her tongue reached the top of
Shizuru’s slit and found a small nub nestled in the folds, the
sharp jolt of pleasure caused Shizuru’s hips to buck up and into
Natsuki’s face.</p><p>Deciding
that Shizuru could do with some steadying, Natsuki slipped her right
hand in under Shizuru’s bum and grabbed a hold of the abundant
flesh there. Judging by Shizuru’s moan, she quite liked this
feeling, so Natsuki decided to work her hand around a bit on it, much
as she’d done with her breasts not long ago. To keep Shizuru held
down, she then pressed her mouth over the top of her slit, allowing
her tongue easy access to her lover’s clit.</p><p>She
prodded her tongue out to gently tap Shizuru’s clit, but even the
gentle contact caused Shizuru to buck her hips again. Natsuki’s
stronger hold allowed her to remain steadier this time, so she
quickly followed this up by flicking Shizuru’s clit again. She kept
this up for a few minutes, each flick being met with a jerk from the
girl, until Shizuru seemed to be bucking her hips in a steady rhythm
to meet Natsuki’s tongue each time.</p><p>Deciding
to change the pace a little, Natsuki pressed her mouth in tighter,
allowing her lips to wrap tightly around the small bundle of nerves
as she sucked in. A deep moan from Shizuru let her know that this was
appreciated. To finish off this round of ministrations, Natsuki tried
one last thing. Opening her mouth up so she could get in as close as
possible to Shizuru, she brought her teeth in and caught the swollen
bud between them, biting down ever so softly. This got her a sharp
gasp and a jerk of Shizuru’s hips, followed by a mumbled, “Oh,
Natsuki…”</p><p>Releasing
Shizuru’s clit from her bite, Natsuki gave it one last kiss before
moving lower. She briefly teased Shizuru by allowing her tongue to
trace a circle around her opening, but a frustrated groan from the
girl gave her a pang in her heart that she couldn’t resist. To
satisfy her lover’s needs, she quickly thrust her tongue as far
into Shizuru’s hole as it would fit.</p><p>The
feeling of Shizuru’s inner walls tightening around her tongue was
heavenly. They soon relaxed, though, allowing Natsuki some freedom to
explore around. She started by circling around inside, trying to feel
up as much of the depths against as much of her tongue as possible.
Shizuru soon caught on to her pattern, and she responded by rotating
her hips in time with Natsuki to increase the pressure of the
contact.</p><p>Natsuki
could tell that Shizuru was getting close, as her breathing pace was
rapidly increasing. To help push her over the final edge, Natsuki
brought her tongue up to the top of Shizuru’s hole and started
slowly thrusting it in and out. On each thrust inside, she tried to
reach it up and around as much as possible to see if she could hit
that magic spot inside. She wasn’t able to tell if she was quite
hitting it, but Shizuru was getting enough out of her thrusts in any
case.</p><p>Shizuru’s
gasps turned into moans as she started bucking her hips back into
Natsuki’s rhythm. Feeling the girl’s response, Natsuki gradually
picked up the pace. She spread her tongue out to fill up as much of
Shizuru as possible, delighting in the taste and feeling of her inner
depths. Soon enough, Shizuru’s walls started contracting, and
Natsuki could tell that she was about to climax. To push her over the
final edge, she brought in her free left hand above her mouth. It
took her less than a second to find Shizuru’s swollen clit, and she
gave it a good pinch, hoping the spark of pleasure would be just what
Shizuru needed to ignite the blaze of her orgasm.</p><p>The
sound of Shizuru’s scream filled the room, and Natsuki’s tongue
was clamped down by Shizuru’s contracting walls. As soon as the
walls loosened up a little, Natsuki tasted fluids rushing down from
within. She quickly lapped them all up, not allowing a drop the leak
out. The motions of her tongue inside the girl caused further jolts
of pleasure to course through Shizuru, judging by the repeated jerks
of her walls and her sharp moans.</p><p>Eventually,
Shizuru’s moans settled into a low purr and her vaginal muscles
started to relax. Natsuki took this as her cue to extricate herself
from Shizuru’s depths and come up to meet her lover again. She
crawled back up the bed and laid down to the side of Shizuru. Her
lover’s face showed an expression of utter contentment, with a few
extra trails of tears having formed.</p><p>Natsuki
slipped an arm in under Shizuru and rolled her onto her side for a
sweet kiss to close off the moment. Shizuru weakly responded to her,
still a bit dazed from the experience. Her arms slowly made their own
way around Natsuki to hold her close. Breaking from the kiss after a
minute, Natsuki allowed her head to come to rest against Shizuru’s.
“I love you, Shizuru,” she whispered. “Never doubt that.”</p><p>“I
love you too, Natsuki,” the girl whispered back, her voice sweet
and almost cracking.</p><p>They
laid like that for many more minutes, just reveling in the contact
with each other. Eventually, Natsuki took a deep breath and broke the
silence. “Shizuru… if you want me now, I think I’m ready.”</p><p>Natsuki
couldn’t see Shizuru’s face, but she imagined a smile forming on
it as the girl responded. “Thank you, Natsuki, but can you wait a
couple more days? I want to make everything perfect for you then.”</p><p>“What
could be more perfect than this?” Natsuki asked. <i>I’m
lying in the arms of my beautiful girlfriend, having just brought her
to the heights of pleasure. I don’t know how I could feel more in
the mood, </i>she added silently.</p><p>“You’ll
see,” was all Shizuru said in response. It was sufficient to send a
wave of warmth through Natsuki’s body, though, as she tried to
imagine what the girl might have planned for her.</p><p>After
a few more minutes of lying there, Natsuki’s eyes drifted open.
They landed on the small table beside Shizuru’s bed, where a small
clock displayed that it was almost time for them to be getting some
dinner. Partially breaking from Shizuru’s hug so she could roll
over and check the other side, Natsuki decided that something was
missing. “Um, Shizuru,” she said. “You know that picture of us
I keep by my bed?”</p><p>“Of
course. Natsuki’s so cute in it,” Shizuru replied with a loving
grin.</p><p>Feeling
a small heat rise to her cheeks, Natsuki continued, “We need to get
you a copy. I’ll ask Chie later if she can print out another for
us.”</p><p>Shizuru’s
cheeks quickly reddened to mirror Natsuki’s. She bent her head
forward to give Natsuki a quick kiss on the tip of her nose. “Thank
you, Natsuki,” she said. “Though I hope soon enough we’ll be
able to get some new pictures taken of us as an official couple.”</p><p>Natsuki
allowed a little smile to tug at her lips. “Yeah, I guess that
would be alright.”</p>
