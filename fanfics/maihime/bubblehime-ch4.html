<h1>Bubblegum Hime (part 4 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a>

<a href="../maihime/bubblehime-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;You&#39;re WHAT?!&quot; Natsuki Kuga blurted, the dark blue
haired woman sitting up on the couch as she looked
over at her companion in surprise, candles on a nearby
coffee table driving away the darkness of the evening

Shizuru Fujino sat beside her, smiling slightly as she
petted Natsuki&#39;s arm. &quot;I&#39;m the new Hime, of course,&quot;
she purred as she brown haired girl snuggled close,
&quot;who else do you think I would let watch over my
Natsuki?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not your Natsuki,&quot; she muttered, but there really
wasn&#39;t much heat in the statement, Natsuki clearly
distracted by the hand on her arm.

A bit more tentatively Shizuru continued, &quot;You don&#39;t
mind, do you?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Natsuki admitted, &quot;I don&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;Oh good,&quot; with a catlike movement Shizuru nearly
pounced on Natsuki, kissing her firmly even as she
pressed her back into the couch.

&quot;Eep!&quot; Natsuki gasped as she felt warm hands caress
her shoulders and hot lips press skillfully against
her own. Her objections dissolved into a soft moan as
Shizuru&#39;s hands moved to more intimate territory...

...just as both their beepers went off.

&quot;Well darn,&quot; Shizuru said mildly as she drew back,
real frustration simmering in her red eyes. She got up
reluctantly, &quot;Mashiro gave you one of those beepers
too?&quot;

&quot;Mine was from Yukino,&quot; a visibly annoyed Natsuki got
up as she adjusted her shirt to try to maintain her
dignity, &quot;but I bet Mashiro gave them to her.&quot;

&quot;I hate to go,&quot; Shizuru sounded annoyed, &quot;but my gear
is back at my apartment.&quot; Gently kissing Natsuki she
added, &quot;Ill meet you at the site.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be there,&quot; Natsuki agreed as she watched her go.

As Natsuki headed for her bedroom she shook her head,
trying to sort out the complicated feelings. On one
hand she was worried about Shizuru joining the Hime
and facing the danger they faced but on the other hand
she was also happy, knowing that she and Shizuru now
shared a common experience they hadn&#39;t before.

The silvery armor was waiting in it&#39;s concealed
charging station, the circuitry humming softly as it
drew in juice for another night on the town.
Gracefully she pulled on the core unit first, the
chest plate and back pack locking in with a snap, then
she stepped into each of the armored legs. Like a
knight in another age she pulled on her wolf-like
helm, the matching arm units and finally snapped on
each of the cannons and her gloves.

&quot;Yukino,&quot; Natsuki activated the communicator in her
helmet as she briskly asked their commander, &quot;what&#39;s
the situation?&quot;

Yukino&#39;s voice was as calm as usual as the young woman
replied, &quot;Mai and I are out here tracking a new
Orphan, a snake based design. If it has similar armor
to the last one, Mai and Mikoto won&#39;t be enough to do
it.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Natsuki fought bac a slight smile as she
imagined the reaction ti her next statement, &quot;Kiyohime
and I are on our way.&quot;

&quot;So, you know it&#39;s Shizuru?&quot; Yukino sounded annoyingly
unsurprised.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Natsuki growled as she walked over to the
porch. Bracing herself she leaped from the balcony,
jet thrusters in each boot firing a moment to slow her
decent before she thumped to the ground then raced off
into the night. &quot;How did you find out?&quot;

&quot;Pushed Mashiro into telling me,&quot; Yukino admitted.

&quot;Heh,&quot; Natsuki smiled as she called up a heads-up
display, overlaying a map of Fuka with the location
beacons of the other Hime armor. In a moment she found
them, shifting her course north over a open field.

Mai flickered with fire as her winged armor soared
over head, clawlike hands flaring as she cast
fireballs at the snake like beast writhing across the
grass. Mikoto bounded across the lawn, her armor
gleaming green as she swung her massive sword,
cleaving some of the scaily outer skin off.

Yukino looked up, some of the remotes from her armor
hovering around her as they gathered data. &quot;About
time.&quot; she gently teased.

&quot;What&#39;s the plan?&quot; Natsuki asked, studying their foe
warily.

&quot;A standard hot and cold strike might do it,&quot; Yukino
trailed off, &quot;incoming.&quot;

With a smooth grace Shizuru arrived, her purple and
silver armor slinging to her body in a way that
Natsuki found disturbingly erotic. &quot;Thank you for
coming,&quot; Natsuki croaked.

Shizuru smiled winningly at Natsuki, &quot;But I haven&#39;t
come yet.&quot;

&quot;Shizuru!&quot; Natsuki blushed.

&#39;This is going to be a long night,&#39; Yukino though to
herself wryly. &quot;President Fujino,&quot; she asked formally,
&quot;did Mashiro equip your armor for distance attacks.&quot;

In a somewhat more serious tone Shizuru replied,
&quot;Somewhat. I can spray bursts of highly powerful acid,
but I need a closer range to be certain I hit.&quot; She
smiled, &quot;But with my speed and agility I should be
able to do it.&quot;

Natsuki stiffened a bit, but nodded reluctantly.
&quot;You&#39;ll need a distraction to make it in,&quot; she said
calmly, &quot;let me be it.&quot;

&quot;No, all of us,&quot; Yukino corrected firmly. She looked
at Shizuru as she asked, &quot;So you&#39;re sure you can make
it?&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; Shizuru answered as she hefted the naginata
she wielded as a main weapon, the snake heads on her
armor looking deadly with purpose.

&quot;Then let&#39;s go,&quot; Yukino nodded.

&quot;Load Silver Cartridge,&quot; Natsuki ordered her suit,
feeling the mechanism smoothly transfer the ammo to
her arm cannon, &quot;Fire!&quot;

Even as a wave of ice roared in Mai fired from above,
blasting the other side with pure heat. Yukino&#39;s
drones flashed around it, flaring with confusing tones
as Mikoto raced forward and back, taunting their
powerful foe.

Like a ghost Shizuru creaped up before leaping, the
two snake head ornaments on the shoulders of her armor
opening to spew silvery acid over the beats. As it
vainly snapped at it&#39;s new foe Shizuru raised her
blade, driving it down and through the now weakened
armor.

&quot;Arroo!&quot; the thing howled in pain, bucking and
writhing as it went into it&#39;s death throws, finally
sending Shizuru flying away.

&quot;No!&quot; Natsuki called out in alarm as she raced to
catch her, using her boot jets to reach her fast
enough then doing what she could to slow her fall.

&quot;Ooof,&quot; Shizuru gasped, ending up cradled in Natsuki&#39;s
arms.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Natsuki demanded.

Shizuru smiled slightly as she said reassuredly, &quot;I&#39;m
fine, Natsuki.&quot; Her smile widened a bit as she cuddled
close and rubbed her cheek up against Natsuki&#39;s
breasts, &quot;In fact, I can&#39;t think of many places I&#39;d
rather be.&quot;

Pointedly ignoring the loving couples Ami sent out her
drones once more, combing over the creature for data
as she confirmed it was dead. &quot;Mai, Mikoto,&quot; she asked
even as she monitored the data stream, &quot;are you all
right?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re fine,&quot; Mai reassured her as she landed and
flipped her dragon helm up, &quot;I don&#39;t even think Mikoto
got any bruises this time.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Yukino smiled as she sent her drones to
determine where the creature had been, &quot;and it looks
like it&#39;s inert.&quot;

&quot;Mai?&quot; Mikoto tugged on her arm.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Mai looked down at the smaller girl.

Mikoto pointed, &quot;What are Shizuru and Natsuki doing?&quot;

Mai took a look and winced, &quot;Nothing you need to be
worrying yourself over.&quot;

Yukino sighed as she called to the two Hime, &quot;You
wanna break it up? We need to get going before the
police arrive.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Natsuki pulled back, blushing faintly while
Shizuru pouted.

&quot;Don&#39;t forget to charge your suits in case we&#39;re
called out again,&quot; Yukino firmly reminded them as they
all raced back to the dorms.

Getting back to the dorms after a hard night out Nao
Yuuki paused as she climbed up and over the outer
gate. Dropping down the redhead crouched down,
blinking as she saw the five Hime soar over her then
break up as they headed for various dorms.

&#39;Well well, Nao thought, &#39;looks like the Hime really
do attend Fuka academy.&#39; Carefully she continued on as
she mused, &#39;I wonder how much I can get if I sell that
info to the highest bidder?&#39; With that cheery thought
in her mind Nao went to wok sneaking into the dorms.</pre>
