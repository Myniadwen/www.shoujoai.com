<a href="../maihime/rearranged-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>&quot;Alright, I&#39;ll be back in a few minutes. Get whatever you need together, 
alright?&quot;

&quot;Ok, Natsuki. Please be careful,&quot; Shizuru responded, worried for her 
friend&#39;s safety.

Natsuki smiled reassuringly, then cupped Shizuru&#39;s face and gave her one 
final kiss before going to the door. She knocked on it and was let into 
the hall by one of the guards.

&quot;The ojou-sama has requested that I bring her some tea. I will be 
returning shortly,&quot; she told them before proceeding down the hall.

When she got to the kitchen, she informed them as well and waited as a 
fresh pot of tea was brewed. No questions were asked, and she was soon 
on her way back up to Shizuru&#39;s room with a hot kettle of tea on her 
tray. Now for the hard part.

Heading down the hall toward the guards, she could feel the nervous 
tension mounting in her chest. She really had no idea if this was going 
to work or not; she&#39;d just have to take her chances. As soon as she was 
within a few feet of the first guard, Natsuki grasped the handle of the 
tea kettle and flung the hot liquid into his face. He let out a 
strangled yell of pain as it scalded his skin, and fell to the floor, 
clutching his face in his hands. The other guard soon reacted, shocked 
at first by the unexpected attack, and came at Natsuki.

He was well-trained, and Natsuki had a hard enough time dodging his 
punches, let alone being able to land one on him. The maid uniform 
limited her mobility, not allowing her to fight at her usual level. One 
of his blows landed on her right cheek, knocking her backwards onto the 
floor. She struggled to get back to her feet, but her head was spinning 
from the impact.

&quot;You sneaky bitch,&quot; the guard sneered as he approached her, intending to 
finish her off. She surprised him, however, by sweep-kicking his feet 
out from under him and bringing him crashing to the ground. She got up 
and quickly knocked him out with a well-aimed strike. Before she had 
time to do anything else, an arm snaked around her neck in a tight 
stranglehold.

&quot;You&#39;re going to pay for that,&quot; the other guard said to her menacingly 
as he increased the pressure on her neck. The circulation of blood to 
her head was slowing, and it had become impossible for her to break the 
hold he had on her. Shit, I&#39;m going to die here, she thought to herself, 
as black spots began to obscure her vision.

&quot;Bang!&quot;

Natsuki felt the arm around her neck slacken and then fall away as the 
other guard fell to the floor. She fell to the floor as well, her body 
weak from the near-suffocation. Her eyes fell on Shizuru, the silver 
serving tray in her hands, which she had obviously used to whack the 
guard on the back of the head.

&quot;Natsuki,&quot; she said as she knelt down beside the fallen girl. &quot;Are you 
ok? Can you speak?&quot;

&quot;Unnnnn,&quot; Natsuki groaned in pain. &quot;Ugh, yeah, I&#39;m ok...I think.&quot;

&quot;How many fingers am I holding up?&quot; Shizuru asked, three fingers 
displayed on her left hand.

&quot;Uhhh...&quot; Natsuki squinted, her spinning vision making it nearly 
impossible to discern the number of digits in front of her. Eventually, 
the multiple images circling around in her field of sight consolidated 
into one and she could see clearly. &quot;Three.&quot;

&quot;Whew, you had me pretty worried there Natsuki.&quot;

Back to her senses, Natsuki replied, &quot;I&#39;m ok, but we need to get out of 
here now. I&#39;m sure someone will be here any second after hearing that 
commotion.&quot;

Shizuru helped her up, putting Natsuki&#39;s arm around her shoulder and 
supporting her with her arm. &quot;We&#39;ll go this way,&quot; Shizuru said as the 
began in the opposite direction down the hall, &quot;there&#39;s a back staircase 
we can use.&quot;

They had gone down one floor when they heard someone discover the 
guards&#39; bodies. In no time they were going to see that Shizuru was 
missing too, time was of the essence.

&quot;Shit, we need to go faster,&quot; said Natsuki. &quot;I think I can walk by 
myself now, my head feels a little better.&quot;

They ran down the stairs, keeping their footsteps as light as possible, 
and were soon at the bottom floor. &quot;Shizuru, do you know where the 
switch is that opens the gate?&quot; Natsuki asked.

&quot;Yes, there&#39;s a security room in the back of the house, follow me.&quot;

As they made their way down the hall, Natsuki recognized the door to the 
staff locker room on her left and stopped, grabbing Shizuru&#39;s arm.

&quot;Wait a sec, I gotta get something I left in here,&quot; she told Shizuru.

She ran in and grabbed the familiar black leather suit, relieved to see 
that it was still there. It would have been difficult to get a 
replacement&#151;getting a suit molded to the curves of her body wasn&#39;t an 
easy process.

With that taken care of, they hurried down the hall and were soon at the 
door to the security room. Without hesitation, Natsuki burst in, hearing 
the man in the room say into his transmitter, &quot;...so be on the lookout 
for the ojou-sama and a dark-haired girl in a maid&#39;s uniform&#151;&quot; before 
she effectively knocked him out from behind. She quickly located the 
gate switch and activated it, then grabbed Shizuru&#39;s hand and opened the 
rear door, darting outside.

They ran down the small flight of stairs before making a mad dash across 
the back lawn. The guards outside soon spotted them, and immediately 
began to chase after them.

&quot;Stop!&quot; one of them shouted, but Shizuru and Natsuki had not intention 
of giving in so easily. The lingering patches of snow from a prior 
snowfall made the grass slippery. Natsuki nearly fell when her foot slid 
out from under her, but Shizuru reacted instantly, grabbing her before 
she could hit the ground. They kept running, two of the guards close on 
their tails. A gunshot suddenly rang out from behind them and a bullet 
whizzed past Shizuru&#39;s ear. Another loud crack signaled the firing of 
another gun, and this time it grazed Natsuki&#39;s upper arm. She shouted 
out in pain, but kept her pace as she ran towards the gate.

&quot;Stop firing you idiots! That&#39;s the ojou-sama!&quot; someone yelled. By this 
time, Natsuki and Shizuru had made it to the gate and were sprinting 
down the pavement to where Natsuki had parked her motorcycle. It was 
still sitting there waiting for them, and Natsuki jumped on, pulling 
Shizuru with her. She hastily revved the engine and they were off.

Natsuki noticed two cars tailing them as she turned the corner and 
started heading down the main street out of the neighborhood. She 
would&#39;ve smiled if she weren&#39;t in so much pain, because she effortlessly 
lost them on her racing bike.

Going to her apartment was out of the question, as they would probably 
be searched for there first. Instead, Natsuki took the highway and 
headed out of the city; they would have to stay at a hotel for now. Once 
they were about 20 miles out, she pulled off and soon found an 
unassuming hotel that looked decent enough to stay in.

Not wanting to invoke suspicion with her bleeding arm and bruised cheek, 
Natsuki gave Shizuru some cash and had her go inside to check out a 
room. She returned shortly, and they were soon within their room and 
finally able to breathe a sigh of relief.

With the adrenaline now out of her system, Natsuki grimaced from the 
pain of her injuries. Her cheek and head were throbbing from the punch 
and the stranglehold, and her arm badly stung from where the bullet had 
grazed her. Shizuru worriedly helped her to the bed and laid her down 
before searching for a first aid kit. She found a small one in the 
bathroom containing some bandages and disinfectant and began dressing 
Natsuki&#39;s wounds at once.

&quot;Thank you for rescuing me again,&quot; Shizuru said to her as she doctored 
her arm, &quot;I feel like I haven&#39;t done anything for you.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say that. You&#39;ve done so much for me ever since I first met you; 
I still have a long way to go before I can fully make it up to you.&quot;

&quot;Shhh...that&#39;s not true. You&#39;ve more than made it up to me. You&#39;ve given 
me the one thing I&#39;ve wanted more than anything else...&quot;

&quot;Shizuru...&quot; Natsuki whispered, seeing the tears forming in the other 
girl&#39;s eyes.

Shizuru quickly wiped them away and smiled at Natsuki, a familiar light 
gleaming in her eyes as she teasingly said, &quot;So, you&#39;ve finally whisked 
me away and gotten me all to yourself. What do you plan to do with me?&quot;

&quot;As much as I&#39;d like to think about that, I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re not exactly 
in the clear yet. Do you think your father will call the police?&quot; 
Natsuki asked with concern.

&quot;I&#39;m certain my father won&#39;t risk the media attention that would come 
with reporting me kidnapped or missing. He had a hard enough time 
keeping the fiasco with Tadashi-san under wraps, I doubt he wants to 
deal with that trouble again. Besides, he knows I&#39;m with you, so he 
knows I went with you of my own volition.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s true. But what should we do now? I kind of didn&#39;t plan anything 
past this point,&quot; said Natsuki sheepishly.

&quot;Well I can&#39;t say I would mind spending my days and nights alone with 
you in a hotel room, but what about your classes? You can&#39;t stop going 
to school. Though I suppose you&#39;ll have to until I can discuss this with 
my father and reach some sort of agreement.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be lying in wait for me at the academy, not to 
mention my apartment.&quot;

&quot;Yes, it looks like we&#39;ll have to stay in hotels until I can work 
something out. I won&#39;t be able to use my credit card though, I&#39;m sure my 
father is going to have it monitored to try and track me down.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I can pay for it.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure?&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; Natsuki smiled at her, but her smile was soon replaced by a 
large yawn.

&quot;Oh! I&#39;m sorry, I forgot how tired you must be. Here, let me help 
you...&quot;

Shizuru pulled each of the once-white gloves from Natsuki&#39;s arms, now 
stained with dirt and blood from the events of their action-filled 
escape. Next, she sat Natsuki up and moved to untie the apron from 
around her waist. Drawing close to her, Shizuru couldn&#39;t help the 
arousal that always surfaced within her whenever she was near the other 
girl. Neither could she help placing a kiss on Natsuki&#39;s neck as she 
untied the garment and tossed it to the floor.

Drawing back, she looked lustily into Natsuki&#39;s eyes and said, &quot;You 
really will have to wear this again for me after it&#39;s been cleaned. I 
hardly got to enjoy seeing you in it.&quot;

Resuming her task, Shizuru leaned back in and began undoing the buttons 
on the back of the dress, letting her warm breath caress Natsuki&#39;s bare 
neck. She slid the dress down off her hips, removing the petticoat with 
it. The black heels were taken off one by one, followed by the black 
stockings. Shizuru pulled them down slowly, her fingers lightly brushing 
along the skin of Natsuki&#39;s shapely legs, causing the girl&#39;s breath to 
hitch. Seeing Natsuki clad only in her bra and panties, Shizuru was 
unable to resist pushing the other girl back down on the bed and 
climbing on top of her.

Supporting herself on one elbow, she let her other hand roam freely over 
Natsuki&#39;s body, careful of the wound on her arm and the bruise on her 
cheek. Natsuki reached up and pulled Shizuru&#39;s head down for a kiss, 
loving the sensations Shizuru&#39;s hand was evoking. Said hand was 
currently under the fabric of her panties, squeezing the bare flesh of 
her derri&egrave;re. Natsuki moaned against Shizuru&#39;s lips and pushed her hips 
up into the other girl&#39;s, clutching her shoulders.

Needing to catch her breath, Natsuki tilted her head back, staring at 
the headboard of the bed as Shizuru eagerly continued down her throat. 
Everytime she and Shizuru were intimate like this, it never ceased to 
excite and amaze her. She looked back down at the older girl, who was 
presently consumed with kissing her breasts, and wondered, as she always 
did, how lucky she was that this beautiful woman was in love with her. 
Shizuru was admired by both sexes for her beauty and grace, as well as 
her intelligence. While she was in school, she had quite a sizable 
fanclub (whom Natsuki secretly resented) that followed the lovely 
kaichou around campus, hoping to emulate her style and manner. Shizuru 
had an appeal that couldn&#39;t be resisted, as Natsuki knew all to well. 
Being with Shizuru made her weak in the knees, made her body tremble, 
made her heart beat faster. Unaware of her own captivating appeal, 
Natsuki could only guess at what the other woman saw in her. Her 
thoughts instantly dissipated, however, when Shizuru sucked down hard on 
her nipple while laving over it with her tongue.

Shizuru was losing control, and Natsuki was only encouraging her with 
her whimpers and moans. She knew the younger girl must be sore and 
exhausted after the incidents from earlier in the evening. She was 
probably pushing herself right now for Shizuru&#39;s sake. Not used to being 
the voice of reason in situations like these, Shizuru sat up, straddling 
Natsuki&#39;s hips.

&quot;Shizuru, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Natsuki asked her curiously, and breathlessly.

&quot;Nothing&#39;s wrong Natsuki-chan. I just feel that you must be extremely 
tired, and I don&#39;t want you to overexert yourself with the state that 
your body is in right now. It&#39;s been such a long and trying day, we 
should probably get some rest and continue this when you&#39;re feeling 
better.&quot;

&quot;Well, I have to admit, I am rather tired. Are you sure it&#39;s ok if we 
stop?&quot;

&quot;Of course. Besides, I know it will be more enjoyable when you&#39;ve 
regained your usual energy anyway,&quot; Shizuru said with a playful wink. 
Despite her fatigue, Natsuki still blushed at the teasing remark.

Opening up the small bag she&#39;d packed while waiting for Natsuki, Shizuru 
drew out some sleeping clothes for the two of them and a toothbrush and 
toothpaste.

They got ready for bed and then settled between the sheets. Shizuru&#39;s 
arms were wrapped around Natsuki as the dark-haired girl reached over to 
turn off the bedside lamp. They exchanged whispered endearments with 
each other in the darkness of the hotel room, before quickly succumbing 
to a deep sleep.</pre>
