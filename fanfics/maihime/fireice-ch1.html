<h1>Fire and Ice</h1>

<pre>Rays of dust-moted sunlight filtered through a large open space between
shoji panels that led out to the narrow veranda. They had been partially
opened to let in warm spring air from the mountains. Peaceful quiet
reigned in every corner of the spacious, Zen-like /seitokai/ summer home
just outside of Fuuka proper. Though it was available to all members of
Fuuka Gakuen&#39;s student council, few ever took advantage of its relaxing
atmosphere. Indeed, only one student came on a regular basis ostensibly
meditate in peace, alone with her thoughts and inner demons.

A willow, young girl, whose bearing hovered on that tenuous border
between adolescence and adulthood, sat sedately in the center of a
folded tatami mat, dressed in her favourite spring /yukata/. The
soothing /swish-swish/ of a tea whisk mixing /matcha/ could be heard
over the insistent burbling of the narrow stream that meandered through
the center of a lushly appointed Japanese garden. She thought that it
would be difficult to come back here, given the bad memories that
shadowed the rooms like vengeful ghosts; but the tightening in her chest
eased as soon as she stepped onto the grounds. Guilt did not plague her
as it should. No fiery retribution came to punish her for her actions on
the night that would haunt her for several months.

/Oh how I wish I had been punished/, she mused, her stirring hand paused
momentarily. /Nothing ever works out as it should, does it?/ Melancholy
rushed through her veins and tumbled like icy water over her battle-worn
stone of a heart. /What was that saying? *&#39;Friendship is certainly the
finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.&#39;*/ Her mouth twisted
slightly into a bitter grimace at the remembered words; Jane Austen was
apparently a foolish romantic. Most western writers were when it came to
matters of the heart, she decided.

Rustling sounds from the /genkan/ nearby as someone stepped inside and
discarded their shoes. The visitor was female, younger than she, the
girl judged, by the sound and weight of the footsteps coming closer to
where she sat. Smooth wood slid along its tracks as the fusuma door was
roughly shoved open to admit the guest.

&quot;Did you complete your task?&quot; the seated young woman inquired in a
near-whisper. The tea bowl she held in her hand now contained a light,
frothy tea mixture. Satisfied with the result, she set aside the whisk
aside and took a tentative sip from the cup.

&quot;Yeah, sure but I don&#39;t even know why you bother,&quot; her guest replied in
a gruff tone as she knelt clumsily before the questioner, her features
hidden by the afternoon shadows that painted the room in dimness.

&quot;My reasons are not your concern. You needn&#39;t trouble yourself,&quot; came
the composed rejoinder.

&quot;But can&#39;t you see? She&#39;s an idiot, not to mention clueless as he--&quot;

A dark look from the older girl silenced any further arguments. Her eyes
narrowed almost imperceptibly. &quot;Are you questioning my judgment?&quot;

&quot;No, no!&quot; the visitor backpedaled. &quot;It&#39;s just...why can&#39;t you let it
go?&quot; She paused and shook her head in disbelief. &quot;You&#39;re such a damned
flake, Fujino Shizuru.&quot;

&quot;Have a care,&quot; Shizuru replied softly. &quot;I may have to teach you a lesson
about humility if you continue.&quot;

&quot;Is that a threat or a promise?&quot; Green eyes clashed with mahogany ones,
each waging a battle of wills against the other. Both knew who the
winner would be. Shizuru took another sip from her tea then set the cup
aside. She drew the girl into a gentle embrace and kissed her deeply.

&quot;Which would you prefer, Nao-san?&quot; she sighed.

Nao stared up at Shizuru with an impetuous grin. &quot;How about both?&quot; she
smirked as she untied the /yukata/&#39;s sash.

Shizuru&#39;s breaths came in short, quick pants as sharp nails grazed newly
exposed skin above her breasts. She gritted her teeth as feather-light
fluttering tongue replaced razor-like pain, cooling the heated scars
that criss-crossed her chest.

&quot;Nao-san?&quot; she hissed.

&quot;Yeeess?&quot; the younger girl drawled with a faux innocent look in her
passion-darkened eyes.

&quot;Must you?&quot; Shizuru whispered. Nao swore she heard a hint of pleading in
that cultured voice which only served to inflame her even more.

&quot;Must I what?&quot; she teased with a low chuckle. /Ahh the game is just
beginning./

Dusk faded into inky dark night as Nao touched all of the right places,
sucked, teased and tormented the proper Kyoto woman, making sure to take
her time exploring every inch of Shizuru&#39;s perfect alabaster skin. She
never grew tired of Shizuru&#39;s arching back, her passionate groans, her
hisses of sweet pain.

************************************************************************

A few hours later, the redhead drew on her clothing while eyeing her
lovely prize. She had acquired and, in turn, been taken. Wickedly
grinning, she imagined what the prim Mashiro would think if she knew
that kaichou-sama was a complete hellcat in bed. Nao stepped into the
/genkan/, slid her slender feet into thigh-high boots and strode out
onto the street to wait for her ride.

Some minutes later, she could hear the rumble of a motorcycle engine as
it turned the street corner. The rider pulled up to the curb, tossed her
a helmet and motioned for her to get on.

&quot;How&#39;d it go?&quot; they asked as Nao tucked her hair into the proffered
helmet. &quot;Did she read the letter? Did she say anything about me?&quot;

&quot;Ok, no and no.&quot; Nao replied casually. She watched the rider&#39;s shoulders
slump in defeat. &quot;Oh please, will you knock it off?&quot; /You&#39;re as bad as
she is, pining over lost love. Meh, who needs it?/ &quot;Oi, Kuga, get moving
already will you? Can&#39;t keep the boys waiting.&quot;

The rider turned her head to give Nao an icy glare, though she didn&#39;t
reply. Revving the engine several times to relieve her annoyance,
Natsuki took one last pain-filled look into the darkened courtyard and
skidded off into the night.
