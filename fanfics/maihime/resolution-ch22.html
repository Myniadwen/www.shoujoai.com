<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My first  piece of Japanese in this chapter. <em>Sentai </em> roughly “task  force.” Sorry all. It was unavoidable.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As always,  thanks for reading!</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Intoxicated  eyes / no longer live that life / you should have learned by now /  I’ll burn this </em>whole world down</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  will get what you deserve.</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Had Enough</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Up until  that point, certain elements of the group—Akane and Kazuya, for  example—had been able to ignore, or at least pay as little  attention as possible to, the predicament they were in. A few  others—Mai and Mikoto, Chie and Aoi—knew that there was trouble  brewing, but of what sort they were entirely uncertain.  They had no  solid proof that it had anything to do with them, so they did their  best to pretend that the tragedies occurring in Goza were just  that—tragedies, nothing more. Sick bastards perpetrating sick  crimes, too bad, but damn I’m glad it wasn’t me in that store.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As with  many reality-defying fantasies, however, this illusion ended abruptly  and without mercy. In this case, what brought it to its abrupt,  bloody halt was the abrupt, bloody appearance of a pair of corpses in  their cabin—one in the boys’ room, one in the girls’.  Midori  supposed this was not entirely usual, but Minoru harbored no such  illusions. He had ended quite a few young idiots’ fantasies more  bloodily than that. He supposed he should feel sorry about that, but  then, it took a special sort of sociopath to do his job in the first  place, as he had been told numerous times.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But,  Minoru supposed, he couldn’t be a sociopath, at least not entirely.   Not when he was helping out a bunch of teens just barely done with  squeaking voices and popping zits, at extreme risk to his own life,  and for absolutely no money.  He supposed he could chalk it up to  revenge—and he did, quite vehemently, but something very small and  petulant inside of his head quietly reminded him every time he tried  to convince himself of this that he had never been a particularly  vengeful sort, nor a particularly passionate sort.  Laid-back  sharpshooters weren’t uncommon; he was sure the best out there, as  was the case in most professions, were all full of vim and vigor and  shat something fierce about their job or cause or some such nonsense,  but he had been quite happy where he was prior to this shit-storm:  laid-back, wealthy, and a little above average.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Why,  then, was he helping a man who was strangely smart-looking in his  tacky Hawaiian shirt and a beautiful, buxom redhead who couldn’t  have been more than three years out of college drag corpses out of a  cabin in the middle of some tourist-trap in Goza?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He had  no idea, but whatever it was, he was in it for good or ill.  He could  always bail at the end, he reasoned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yeah  fucking right.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  buried them under the cabin, which was on stilts, chasing out a good  few rats and a good few more spiders that Minoru would sooner never  think about again in the process.  The rats would come back soon  enough, and they would find the corpses and probably get fat off of  them, and the cabin would stink like all hell in a few days, but  these were things for other people to worry about.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What  Minoru had to worry about was getting them out of this situation,  which meant getting them off the beach.  Trouble was, he had  precisely no idea how to do this; their car was almost certainly  wired and watched by a bunch of independent mercs who had no desire  to win an award for <em>above and beyond the call of duty, </em>and so  stayed right where they were, waiting for orders from Scratch-ass,  who was plotting god-knew-what, but appeared to have a small—or  not-so-small—army of them at his beck and call.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Considering  what he knew about mercenaries, it was likely to be the <em>small</em>.   Mercs didn’t come on a global scale anymore, not when it was  usually cheaper to enlist your own kids and arm them with your own  sub-par weapons and use your own inept generals to tell them how best  to get themselves shot. Mostly mercenaries were used in border  skirmishes and by paramilitary groups with a lot of money and an  agenda that nobody gave a shit about but them—he supposed that  Scratch-ass fell cleanly into that category, as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  considered asking Midori as they worked if they had any idea what  that woman, the one with the brown hair—her name escaped him at the  moment—had done to piss such a powerful psychopath off so badly,  but thought it best to rein in for now.  If anybody knew, it was the  woman herself, but she seemed in no condition to do much more than  make out with what appeared to be her girlfriend at this  point—something he’d witnessed and wisely ignored on their way  out with the bodies.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Girlfriend  though? Really? If so, they’ve gotta be about as bipolar as you  were with Kimmi. Maybe.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  then, some people got off on that stuff.  Sometimes, maybe, they were  the ones who had it right.  Their relationships didn’t get as stale  as quickly, and their little nitpicks with other, the<em> little  things </em>that really killed a relationship, never sat inside their  heads, piling up until they exploded.  They came out all at once.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe  there was something to it.  What, Minoru would probably never be sure  of.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They had  no shovels, so they had to work with planks of wood they’d torn off  the side of the cabin.  Minoru had told them he’d foot the bill if  the owner bitched—which, of course, he would. They were just kids,  after all.  He was, as he’d previously noted, wealthy.  Not rich.  Just <em>wealthy. </em> The kind of wealthy you could use to buy a  house, but not a boat—that was how Yumi had put it.  The kind of <em>wealthy </em>he could use to fix a house.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  kind of wealthy that goes away damn fast if you throw it at stupid  shit like cabins. Especially when you’re not getting paid to do it. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  shrugged to himself.  He had enough money.  He always seemed to.  Killing people was one of the world’s best paying jobs—second, it  sometimes seemed, only to whatever job primarily encompassed paying  people to kill other people.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Introspection:  Finished. </em>He said it once in his head, and then said it again to  make sure he’d gotten the message. <em>Maybe later, when you have  no corpses to bury and no apathetic, yet surely deadly mercenaries  watching a van not fifty meters up a hill from you, their approach  towards your cabin probably held off only by ninja who consider </em>bear  food <em>to be a valid tactic. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  shoveled <em>(planked?)</em> a final, almost symbolic scoop of dirt  over the small grave he’d made for the two corpses, and then patted  it down a little.  The girl and her buddy were already out from under  the cabin—whether because they were content to let a middle-aged  coot do most of the dirty work, or because they couldn’t stand the  sight or thought of burying a pair of corpses, both missing important  parts out of themselves, Minoru didn’t much care.  He crawled his  way back out, and shook his close-cut hair out, unleashing a small  flurry of dust onto the pair, who were standing at about arm’s  length from each other, watching him in silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,”  Minoru said, feigning cheer. “That’s done with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  stared at him in silence, neither entirely sure what to say. They  looked more awkward than he’d expected, and he wondered what  precisely they’d been doing while he’d been burying corpses.  He  decided he didn’t much care about that either, but only with a  little effort.  Such was the nature of middle age.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Also  part of the nature of middle-age was a lack of patience with what he  observed to be young-person (not necessarily teenage—that girl  looked to be over twenty) angst, especially while there was imminent  danger. Or maybe that was the nature of surviving in his line of  work.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay.  Don’t talk about it, but you two are going to talk to me, and  you’re going to talk but good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  spoke, but her voice seemed slightly strained. “About what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  stared at her, silently willing her to cut the petty shit out.  He  wasn’t entirely sure what the hell was wrong with the  previously-energetic pair, but he had a feeling it had something to  do with the meter’s distance between them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As he  stared, he noticed something else in her pretty, serious face;  something that seemed unusual: Stress. Her brow was creased, her eyes  narrowed in spite of a lack of sunlight, her mouth curved down just  slightly in the kind of frown that had nothing to do with happiness.  He thought about asking her what the matter was, then decided against  it.  She’d get through it by herself, or if she didn’t, it wasn’t  his problem.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But that  decision nagged at him.  Just a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You,”  he pointed at the boy. “What’s your name again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Reito,”  the boy said. He seemed in better shape than Midori; it seemed, in  retrospect, that his silence was mostly out of …some sort of  courtesy.  “And I don’t think anybody but Shizuru—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  one with the light-brown hair?” Minoru interrupted, still shaky on  names.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  that girl,” Reito said, apparently unfazed by the interruption.  “I  don’t think anybody but her can really tell you what this is about,  but I can hazard a guess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please,”  Minoru said. “Do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  told him what he claimed to remember about the HiME carnival—leaving  out his own participation—and about the First District which sought  to control it, and about the Searrs Foundation. Either of these two  groups may have had the money to pull off a stunt like this, he  explained, but neither, to the best of his knowledge, would have a  motive. Most importantly, he said, because of the destruction of  the…what he called the <em>overlord </em>of the carnival, and thus  the destruction of the conduit between this world and the “star,”  neither organization had any reason to continue on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Frankly,  Minoru wasn’t sure how much of it he believed. That was to say, he  was quite positive that he didn’t believe a word of it, and he  would have been able to dismiss Reito as a fucking nut with ease, but  for one thing: Midori.  As he told the story, Midori only watched him  with great seriousness, her mouth shut and her back slumped, as  though from some great weight that she’d been carrying a long, long  time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  Midori, he knew, was no fucking nut.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  troubled him greatly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Magical  girls,” he muttered. “You mean to tell me that you were…all of  you were…a bunch of magical girls?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  all,” Reito said mildly.  “The two, Chie with the glasses and  city-cut, and Aoi with the blue eyes,” (oddly enough, the latter  description was quite useful for Minoru, who subconsciously noted eye  color upon meeting somebody—perhaps a symptom of staring at too  many people through a high-resolution zoom-scope) “had virtually  nothing to do with any of this.  They’re just…friends.” He  intoned the word a little awkwardly, as though he were pronouncing  something foreign for the second or third time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Magical  girls,” Minoru repeated, sitting down and biting back the urge to  laugh, scream, and then leave.  “I’m running around nearly  getting eaten by bears for a bunch of ex-fucking-Sailor Moons.” He  shook his head, and then stood up again.  “I mean, you <em>are </em>kidding, right? One of you is involved in some sort of gang, and  you pissed somebody in the Yakuza off, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  only watched him, more serious than Minoru had ever seen him while  the man himself was near-hysterical all of a sudden. It made no  sense—<em>couldn’t </em>make any sense. Maybe it was the flaw of  his aged mind, supposedly inured to all of the world’s paradoxes  and inconsistencies, thanks to of his armor of cynicism, the kind  brought about by age.  This was just some stupid kid telling a stupid  joke, right? Reito was  just another pretentious, oversexed,  perpetually drunk college kid, trying to get a rise out of somebody  wa-ay more worldly-wise than he would probably ever be in his entire  coddled life?  Trying to get a rise out of his girlfriend so that  maybe she could get a rise out of him later?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Except  there was nothing <em>coddled-</em>looking about Reito. And there was  nothing <em>rising </em>on either him or the woman next to him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“HiME-<em>sentai,</em>”  Midori murmured suddenly.  “That’s what I called us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  never knew that,” Reito said gently, without looking at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What…the  fuck. This is too fucking much. All of it. Fucking kids don’t want  to admit what kind of trouble they’re in, so they try and lay it on  me with a bullshit story about Magical Girls and an evil lord Kokuyou  who wants…what? A new wife every so often? Who controls the entire  goddamn world through his EVIL POWERS?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  what about the parts that make sense?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  parts that make sense?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  about the abrupt end of the Sino-Russian skirmishes around the time  they described this “carnival” as having ended? What about the  total fucking lack of contracts after that time? Why else would you  have taken an assignment watching girls change through your scope?  You’re not picky, but you’re pickier than that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  shook his head.  This was bullshit.  “I don’t know what you’re  trying to pull on me, Reito,” he said pointedly, angrier than he  had been in months, “but stop, and stop now. You can tell me the  truth if somebody’s involved with the Yakuza or something—if  anybody’s going to go tattling to the cops, it ain’t me, since  the cops would probably like to ask <em>me </em>a few questions while I  was in the neighborhood. But please, do <em>not</em>—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  about the </em>ninja?<em> What about the bears eating freelancers, just  like yourself? What about the tweenie girl who managed to sneak up on  that guy, Nori? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Delusions.  Delusional people. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  was tugging on his leg. He looked down, and saw the girl that he’d  been escorting when the<br />
      <em>ninja</em><br />
  crazy  people in the trees had intervened on their behalf.  Shiho, that was  her name.  She was sitting on the grass, eyes slightly downcast. He  had no idea how he hadn’t heard her sneaking up on him.  He  supposed it gave validity to the <em>crazy people in masks </em>theory,  though.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What she  said, though, did not. Nor did the look in her eyes—one of  near-psychotic horror, and borderline-metal-case depression.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  killed him,” she murmured. “Please don’t make me prove it to  you.  They’re telling the truth—I killed him. I don’t want to  have to think about it again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  blinked.  There was absolutely nothing false in her eyes. Nothing.  Unsettling? Yes, but nothing that was untruthful.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Unsettling  like a child who had killed somebody. He’d seen those; of course he  had. The near-dead eyes, frightened and hostile all at once; usually  those kids gripped an AK-47 or something equally ancient and deadly,  and Minoru had always been glad that he’d been looking at them  through a scope from a tree, and not a pair of combat goggles from a  bush.  Given a big gun and a little instruction, anybody could kill  somebody given enough provocation, but it took a kid’s blind fear  and unthinking reflexes to blast the shit out of any bush that moved.  Kids knew nothing of <em>standoffs. </em>If you cornered a kid and he  had a gun, you killed him or he killed you a second later.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Those  had not been good days, but they were precisely the days he was now  reliving, courtesy of one Shiho Munakata.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  turned his head away.  Like he had before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine,”  he said. “Say I believe you.” He didn’t, but he found himself  willing to give them the benefit of the doubt if it meant not having  to see a little kid look like that again.  “Say you’re all  former…magical girls…and you’re on the run from an evil  organization.  What do they want with you? And why the girl,  especially?”  Realizing that this description benefited nobody, he  gestured in the general direction of the cabin for added emphasis.  Reito knew who he was talking about.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shizuru.   Shizuru Fujino.  I have no idea. I’d ask her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  plan on it.” He paused. “Once she’s clothed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  nodded sagely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  would, too. If he was going to help these kids out, free of charge,  and take Scratch-ass down (he was planning on that anyway, but they  didn’t need to know that) then he was going to know <em>exactly </em>what  in the flying fuck was going on.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“How  far out are they?” the man with the scratchy voice asked over the  radio. The man with the sniper rifle took another look through his  scope, adjusted the dials on its rangefinder, and stared for a  second.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  kilometer, tops.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  didn’t you spot them sooner?” The man with the sniper rifle  wasn’t entirely sure, but the hoarse, flat man sounded almost  disappointed. Like a chastising mother.  The thought amused him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  had a well-thought-out approach vector, and they’re moving in  unmarked cars.  If I hadn’t spotted the guy takin’ a leak out the  side of the convoy, they’d probably been up our ass ‘fore I  caught wind of them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  expect that if that were true, you would not have much of an ass to  spot them with,” the man with the hoarse voice said. “They are,  after all, coming to kill you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  quite, buddy,” the man with the scope said, and then cut the  transmission by way of tossing the radio to the ground. “They’re  coming for those kids down there, and frankly, I don’t intend to be  anywhere nearby when they show up. Pay is nice, but the advance was  enough to feed me for at least a few weeks”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nor  should he have, because what he saw was enough to drive just about  anybody just a little deeper underground: A full convoy, perhaps  sixteen or twenty unmarked vans, filled with what appeared to be  professional soldiers, headed straight for them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Unfortunately,  he never got the chance to spend the advance. About ten seconds after  the radio hit the ground, splitting into pieces, the man who was  supposed to be backing him up, a man who he had never met before this  day, shot him twice in the head from a tree not twenty meters off  with a silenced pistol. The pistol clicked twice, and the man sagged  into his harness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do  you think you can hit the driver of the lead truck?” the man with  the hoarse voice asked this man.  “If you can, then you can leave;  return to your designated waiting point and I’ll be in touch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  just want me to harass them, is all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  need you to hold them up for at least five more minutes. I have  regulars on the way, but without this extra time, the regulars will  arrive to find nothing more than an empty camp.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  slow them down, eh?” the man said, taking a drag on his cigarette  and raising his large automatic sniper rifle to his eye.  “You got  it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Once  you’re clear, your contract is filled. Wait around for your payment  is all you need do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,”  he said.  The line went dead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This was  probably suicide.  If these guys were actually regulars, they’d  have commandoes in the forest by now, hunting for people just like  him.  Factor in the middle-aged coot in the camp who seemed to be  pretty damn good with his own boomstick, and you had a simple  equation: Fire, and die.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But what  the hell.  He’d shot the other guy, as per orders, and he expected  somebody was waiting around to shoot him if he didn’t do what the  throaty bastard said, also as per orders.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  were less than half a kilometer away now, on the main road, kicking  up a hell of a dust cloud.  Looking through his scope, he could see,  through the windshield of the lead vehicle, eight men, all dressed in  modern-looking combat armor, performing their final weapon checks;  cocking weapons, making sure they were loaded properly, that sort of  thing. All of their weapons were pointed at the ceiling, which meant  they weren’t amateurs, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  maybe they were, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He did a  quick test of the wind, found there to be none, and then shot the  driver.  His gun made a resounding <em>crack </em>in the air, which  seemed to bounce off of the water and back at him.  His vehicle  stayed on course for a few seconds, and then started to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  started packing up.  Now they would <em>definitely </em>be searching  for him, and like the throaty bastard had said, regulars were coming  from his side as well. No need for him to stick around.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No need  at all.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
They had  gathered just outside the cabin again when the shot rang out from the  forest, driving them all to the ground in a reflex that none of them  should have been able to pick up so easily.  Shizuru had acquired  clothing from somewhere, but she was still standing un-platonically  near Natsuki; Mai had a campfire just starting to lick at the edges  of a small temple of wood, and Minoru had his backpack.  They were  going to decide what they needed to do.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A few  seconds after the first shot, there was an explosion, and if Minoru  listened carefully—which he did—he could hear people shouting.  Not panicked voices; authoritative.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  was that?” Chie asked, her voice understandably strained.  They all  looked at Minoru, who shrugged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hell  if I know,” he murmured. “Trouble is what I call it. I think we’d  better go to ground, but fast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  had more or less recovered herself, and it was she who looked at him  now.  After a second, he met her gaze, and a silent understanding  formed immediately: <em>Minoru is the only person here who has any  experience in modern warfare.  That girl, Natsuki, has killed before,  but she has not been to war.  People will listen to Midori, so Midori  must be an extension of Minoru’s orders right now.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright,”  Midori said, snapping to.  “Everybody, to the forest, now. Safest  spot to be.” As much as Minoru hated to admit it, it was probably  true—he had heard soldiers, and if soldiers were making themselves  heard, they were coming in bulk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Besides,  there might be<br />
      <em>ninja</em><br />
  some  deranged lunatics in the forest, who just happened to be damn good at  tree-to-tree fighting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  started to move. They made it about five meters before the first  authoritative voice—the same one he’d heard after the explosion,  shouted, “Stop! Stay where you are!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then  Minoru heard guns being cocked.</span></p>
