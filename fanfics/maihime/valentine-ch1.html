<h1>My Valentine</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Nao,&quot; Aoi Senou smiled at her roommate as the long
brown haired girl asked, &quot;do you think you could give
me some advice?&quot;

&quot;What kind of advice?&quot; Nao Yuuki asked warily, the
redhead gracefully changing out of her nun&#39;s uniform.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure what I should give for a Valentine&#39;s
day gift,&quot; Aoi admitted.

Nao smiled a bit coldly as she answered, &quot;I&#39;m not
really the best person to ask that, you know. Why not
go to Chie?&quot;

Aoi blushed a bit, &quot;That would spoil the surprise.&quot;

Nao blinked, &quot;So that&#39;s how it is.&quot;

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Aoi sighed.

&quot;Good for you,&quot; Nao flashed a somewhat more relaxed
grin. She sat down on her bed in just bra and panties,
&quot;Chocolate&#39;s always good.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Aoi conceded, &quot;but it lacks a personal
touch.&quot;

&quot;Depends on the chocolate,&quot; Nao looked impish, &quot;I
know of a shop in town that sells chocolate edible
panties.&quot;

&quot;Seriously?!&quot; Aoi blushed.

&quot;Yup.&quot; Nao smirked as she added, &quot;why, you could even
be INSIDE the panties when Chie starts eating them.&quot;

&quot;Hentai,&quot; Aoi said good naturedly as she tossed a
pillow at Nao.

&quot;Not going to do it?&quot; Nao asked as she ducked the
flying pillow.

&quot;Well,&quot; Aoi hesitated a moment then added, &quot;I
wouldn&#39;t mind knowing where the shop is, at least.
Just in case.&quot;

Meanwhile, Mai Tokhia smiled slightly as the redhead
read yet another letter sent from her brother in
America. &quot;Aww,&quot; she smiled fondly as she told Mikoto,
&quot;Takumi made Akira chocolate for Valentine&#39;s day.&quot;
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t Akira have made Takumi the chocolate?&quot;
Mikoto Minahi asked her innocently, the black haired
girl sitting beside Mai on the bed.

&quot;Normally,&quot; Mai said, &quot;but they have a reversed
relationship.&quot;

&quot;Reversed?&quot; Mikoto blinked innocently.

&quot;You see, with them Akira is more the boy,&quot; Mai
scratched her chin uncomfortably, &quot;and Takumi is the
woman.&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; Mikoto looked thoughtful. &quot;Does that mean that
when Natsuki and Shizuru are together one of THEM is
the man and the other a woman?&quot;

&quot;I hadn&#39;t really thought about it,&quot; Mai blushed.

&quot;Maybe I should ask Natsuki about it,&quot; Mikoto
suggested brightly.

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Mai said quickly, &quot;bad idea.&quot;

&quot;You think so?&quot; Mikoto looked disappointed.

&quot;I know so,&quot; Mai said firmly.

&quot;Mai,&quot; MIkoto looked up at her, &quot;which of us would
give the other chocolate?&quot;

&quot;I guess I&#39;d give chocolate to you,&quot; Mai reached out
to hug Mikoto.

&quot;Yay,&quot; Mikoto practically bowled Mai over,
&quot;chocolate!&quot;

&quot;Mikoto,&quot; Mai squealed out a protest as Mikoto
joyfully rubbed her face all over Mai&#39;s full breasts,
&quot;stop that!&quot;

There was a brisk knocking on the dorm room door then
Natsuki Kuga stuck her head in, &quot;Mai, I.....&quot; Natsuki
stopped, then turned around and closed the door behind
her, &quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to interrupt.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not what it looks like,&quot; Mai said weakly.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Natsuki murmured as she walked down the hall,
&quot;I hadn&#39;t realized their relationship had gone that
far. Of course, her own relationship had been showing
a lot of progress, too, so she shouldn&#39;t be too
surprised.

Over by the school lockers, a blonde haired young
woman named Erstin paused, looking around her
nervously before stepping up to the lockers. Opening
one up she set the package inside then closed the
door.
&quot;Isn&#39;t that Nina&#39;s locker?&quot; a voice asked from behind
her.

Erstin whirled around to see her classmate Arika
Yumeria, the reddish brown haired girl looking on with
amusement. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; she asked,
blushing.

&quot;Putting a chocolate in Shizuru-sama&#39;s locker,&quot; Arika
shrugged casually, &quot;so, were you giving Nina
chocolate?&quot;

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Erstin admitted, scratching at the back
of her head and not incidentally causing her full
breasts to bounce. Clasping her hands in front of her
she begged, &quot;Please don&#39;t tell Nina I left it.&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Arika grinned, &quot;as long as you don&#39;t tell
Shizuru-sama I did.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Erstin sighed in relief as they both
walked away. &quot;So, you like Fujino-sama?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Arika nodded as they headed outside the
building, &quot;she&#39;s so elegant.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Erstin nodded agreement. &quot;Do you know,&quot; she
asked Arika hesitantly, &quot;if Nina likes anyone?&quot;

&quot;I heard she had a crush on Tate,&quot; Arika revealed
reluctantly, &quot;but since he&#39;s going out with Tokhia it
should be okay.&quot;

Erstin smiled sunnily, &quot;Then maybe there&#39;s a chance.&quot;

&quot;Have you heard anything about Shizuru-sama?&quot; Arika
asked.

&quot;Just the rumors about the raven,&quot; Erstin said
quietly.

&quot;The raven?&quot; Arika blinked.

Dropping her voice more Erstin continued, &quot;That&#39;s
what they call her. An intense black haired woman whom
Fujino-san has been seen with.&quot;

&quot;Shizuru-sama likes women?&quot; Arika asked, eyes wide.

&quot;That&#39;s the story,&quot; Erstin nodded.

&quot;Ah hem!&quot; a woman said from behind them.

&quot;Eeek,&quot; Both girls spun around to see Haruka
Suzushiro standing behind them, the tough brown-blonde
haired woman giving them a intense look.

&quot;I would think,&quot; Haruka said coldly, &quot;that students
would have enough respect for the student council
president not to spread rumors about her.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, Suzushiro-san,&quot; Erstin blushed.

Haruka relaxed a little bit, the older girl not
seeing any maliciousness in either of them. &quot;Spreading
rumors is bad both for the target of rumors and you,&quot;
she pointed out to them, &quot;it makes you seem low
quality.&quot;

&quot;I think you mean low class,&quot; the other girl pointed
out from beside Haruka.

&quot;Thanks, Yukino,&quot; Haruka smiled at her. 

Seeing an opportunity to escape Arika quickly said,
&quot;We&#39;re really sorry, Suzushiro-san.&quot; Grabbing Erstin
she then fled, hurrying down the sidewalk.

Yukino Kikukawa smiled wryly, the dark brown haired
girl pushing up her glasses. &quot;I wonder if Fujino
appreciates your efforts to control the rumors about
her?&quot; she asked as she fell into step beside Haruka.

&quot;I doubt the tea-woman cares,&quot; Haruka said dryly,
&quot;but.....&quot;

&quot;Natsuki thanked us for stepping so firmly on the
rumors,&quot; Yukino revealed, &quot;so at least one of them
appreciates it.&quot; She reached out, taking Haruka&#39;s
hand, &quot;And it says what kind of person you are too,
Haruka.&quot;

Haruka blushed but kept hold of Yukino&#39;s hand as they
walked under the sunlight.

Chie Harada finished up her lunch, the purple-black
haired girl a little disappointed that Aoi wasn&#39;t
there. &#145;Then again,&#39; she mused, &#145;this is Valentine&#39;s
day. I wonder if I should take her out to dinner?&#39;

*beep-beep-BEEP-beep*

Chie answered the phone reflexedly, &quot;Harada.&quot;

&quot;Chie,&quot; Aoi&#39;s voice said smilingly, &quot;I finished up my
shopping. Do you think you could come over to my
rooms?&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Chie asked curiously.

&quot;Nao is going out tonight,&quot; Aoi added with a smile,
&quot;and I have a special treat for you.&quot;

&quot;What kind of treat?&quot; Chie had to asked.

&quot;Let me show you,&quot; Aoi purred.

Chie blinked as Aoi sent a photo to her camera.
Clicking it open Chie froze, then scrambled for a
napkin to stop the nosebleed. Aoi was posed on the
bed, wearing a outfit that would have fit right in
with Kuga&#39;s rumored closet of earthly delights. &quot;I&#39;ll
be right over,&quot; she breathlessly vowed.

&quot;Thought you would,&quot; Aoi smirked.

Notes: Just a bit of fluff featuring my fave My Hime
couples. I also slipped in a bit of Otome since the
characters show up in the background of the Hime
series. Heh.</pre>
