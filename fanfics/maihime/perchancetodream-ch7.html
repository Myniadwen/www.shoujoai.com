<h1>Perchance to Dream (part 7 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leebot.html">Leebot</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/perchancetodream-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><p>Sleeping Angel</p><hr>It took a bit of
squirming around, but Natsuki eventually found the perfect position
as she embraced Shizuru. Her arms and legs remained wrapped around
Shizuru, and her head was nestled in between Shizuru’s breasts,
using her right one as a pillow. Shizuru couldn’t help but giggle
from seeing her girlfriend choosing such an intimate position; it
showed just how open she was at this moment, not a thought of modesty
or embarrassment on her mind.</p><p>Natsuki drifted off to
sleep almost immediately upon choosing this position. To Shizuru,
this was perhaps the most intimate gesture possible from the girl.
She was opening herself up completely in her sleep, making herself
vulnerable to anything Shizuru might wish to do. She was no longer
afraid of Shizuru taking advantage of her in her sleep. She’d even
given her girlfriend explicit permission to kiss her anytime she was
asleep.</p><p>Shizuru took advantage
of this permission now. She couldn’t reach Natsuki’s lips without
bothering the girl, so she settled for planting a kiss on the top of
her head. She inhaled the scent of Natsuki’s hair as she did so,
reveling in her essence. She was a bit sweaty from the exertion of
their lovemaking, but she still smelled just as heavenly as ever.</p><p>Shizuru brought her
head back up and laid it on the pillow, bent just enough so that she
could look down at Natsuki. The girl was so angelic in her sleep. Her
usual gruff exterior was completely gone. All that was left was a
perfectly innocent, adorably cute girl. It was the sight that had
caused Shizuru to lose control of her impulses back during the
Carnival. Natsuki was at her most adorable when she was asleep, and
it was a true blessing that she now allowed Shizuru to not only see
her in this state, but be in a naked embrace with her as she did so.</p><p><i>Ara, it’s 
almost
too much.</i> A wave of sadness hit Shizuru. It was still hard,
sometimes, to believe that this was all real. After all she’d done
to Natsuki, it was hard to feel like she truly deserved the pure
pleasure of moments like these. The girl was truly an angel to be
able to forgive her and come so far so fast in opening herself up.
Natsuki’s love was the best thing that had ever happened to
Shizuru, and she didn’t know if she’d ever be able to make
herself worthy of it.</p><p>“We need to talk,
Shizuru.”</p><p>Shizuru’s mind’s
eye lifted out of her body, and she found herself standing over the
bed. The adorable sight of Natsuki’s sleeping face made her
unconsciously let out a whimper as it came into her view. She allowed
herself to gaze at it for another minute before she rose her head to
the source of the voice. Her cheeks immediately reddened as she
realized that Dream Natsuki was standing before her completely naked,
not making any attempt to cover up her body. “Ara ara…”</p><p>“Oh come on,”
Natsuki said, rolling her eyes. “You’re just as naked as I am,
you know.”</p><p>Looking down at
herself, Shizuru realized this was true. It didn’t bother her,
though. She quite enjoyed the thought of Natsuki looking over her
naked body. “Ara, it’s just that Natsuki is usually so modest.
It’s still a bit new for her to let me see her body without any
attempt to cover it up.”</p><p>Natsuki chuckled a bit
at this. “Just wait until tomorrow…”</p><p>“Tomorrow?”</p><p>A shrug. “Oh, just
knowing you and, well, kind of <i>being</i> Natsuki, something tells
me you’ll be seeing a lot more of her body once the two of you wake
up, not to mention feeling and tasting a lot more of it.”</p><p>Shizuru blushed again
at the blatant suggestion. It seemed that living in Shizuru’s mind
had taught Dream Natsuki quite a bit about the art of teasing, and
just what methods worked best on Shizuru. She idly wondered if the
real Natsuki would ever figure that much out about her. Perhaps in
time, though hopefully she’d never develop an immunity to Shizuru’s
teasing.</p><p>“But as I said, we
need to talk,” Natsuki reminded Shizuru, pulling her out of her
thoughts. “I heard what you were thinking there. What’s with all
this nonsense about you not deserving me?”</p><p>“Oh,” Shizuru said.
She dropped her gaze from Natsuki’s face. Finding that staring at
her naked breasts wasn’t any more comfortable, she averted her gaze
off to the side. At an impatient grunt from Natsuki, she realized
that an explanation was required. “Well, I guess it’s just hard
to get out of my mind all the times I took advantage of you. Even
though you forgave me for it all, it still feels like it’s all
hanging over my head.”</p><p>Shizuru heard a
sympathetic sigh from close by, and she felt her chin being cupped by
Natsuki, who’d somehow exploited the loose physics of the dream
world to instantly move next to her. The girl pulled her face around
to look directly into her eyes. “Would it help if I used up the
other three coupons?” she asked, her voice and eyes full of
concern. “That would be one less excuse you could use for us not
being even.”</p><p>“I guess,” Shizuru
said, a bit reluctantly. She brought a hand up to remove Natsuki’s
from her chin. She wasn’t going to try to hide her face from the
girl again. “But I don’t know if my guilt can go away that
easily.”</p><p>“Well, it’s a
start,” Natsuki said. “Be sure to tell the real me about this a
bit later, okay? I’m sure I’ll do my best to help you out. But
please, I really wish you wouldn’t feel so guilty. You’ve done so
many good things for me out of love.” She leans forwards to give
Shizuru’s lips a soft kiss. When their lips met, Shizuru’s world
immediately contracted to simply their two mouths and the delightful
feelings Natsuki was eliciting in her. “Tonight comes to mind,”
she whispered as their lips parted, far too soon.</p><p>“I was only repaying
the favor…” Shizuru said weakly. The kiss had sent her mind into
the daze Natsuki’s sweet gestures always did. It seemed a bit odd
that a dream was affecting her this much, but she wasn’t going to
complain.</p><p>“How can I get it
through your head that you deserve happiness?” Natsuki said with a
frustrated sigh. Her eyes looked imploringly at Shizuru’s for a
moment before another idea seemed to come to her. “Okay, what about
this: Look at all the emotional trauma you and I were put through
thanks to the Carnival. After all the pain and heartbreak of that,
don’t you think you deserve to be happy in the aftermath?”</p><p>Shizuru shook her head.
“No, I was responsible for too much of that pain myself…”</p><p>“Baka!” Natsuki
said, cutting her off with a glare. Shizuru had thought she’d
developed an immunity to Natsuki’s glare, but this one froze her to
her core. “The Obsidian Lord and the First District were the ones
who caused it all. They’re the ones who set up the whole mess in
the first place, forcing all the HiME to kill each other and feeding
off of their pain and suffering. You and I were just victims of it. I
don’t blame you for anything you did. Not in the slightest. It even
feels good that you cared for me so much, and it hurts me too that I
put you through such pain by rejecting you. Why can’t you let go of
that pain?”</p><p>Shizuru was stunned by
the torrent of emotion Natsuki was letting out. It was obviously
still hurting her to see Shizuru hanging onto her guilt. “Natsuki…
do you really feel this way? I mean… the real you?”</p><p>Natsuki was silent for
a moment, and her facial expression slowly relaxed from the
frustrated anger she’d just shown. “I think so. The real me
doesn’t see into your soul quite so much, but I know she’ll feel
the same way if she can catch the flashes of guilt you let slip
through. You won’t be able to hide it from her forever, you know.
And you really should just be talking this through with her anyways.”</p><p>Shizuru took a 
deep
breath. “Alright. For Natsuki’s sake, I’ll try to get over my
guilt.”</p><p>Natsuki smiled at her.
“Thank you, Shizuru.” She brought her hand up to Shizuru’s
shoulder and lightly traced her fingers down along her arm. “One
more thing I wanted to talk with you about.”</p><p>Shizuru suppressed a
moan of pleasure at Natsuki’s torturous touch. However, her
attempts to suppress her reactions resulted in a whimper escaping
when Natsuki’s hand came around to gently cup her breast. “Does
it have something to do with you trying to get me aroused?” she
managed to pant out.</p><p>“As a matter of
fact…” Natsuki’s fingers gave Shizuru’s nipple a quick pinch,
eliciting a gasp from Shizuru as a bolt of pleasure shot through her
body. “It does. I want you to tell me…” Her other hand came up
to play with Shizuru’s other breast. “Are you getting any…
interesting impulses or fantasies right now?”</p><p>Shizuru bit her lip as
she tried not to get too worked up by Natsuki’s caresses. She
wasn’t sure she wanted to get into this right now, but there didn’t
seem to be much she could do. She wasn’t in charge of her dreams
right now. Though, maybe she just wasn’t trying. Shizuru tried to
pull her hands up to grab Natsuki’s wrists and stop her distracting
motions so she could focus on the conversation, but she found that
they weren’t responding to her.</p><p>In an instant, the
world around her shifted. Shizuru found herself lying on her back on
a four-poster bed. Her arms and legs were spread out, her wrists and
ankles each handcuffed to one of the posts. Natsuki was on top of
her, sitting on Shizuru’s pelvis while her hands played with
Shizuru’s breasts.</p><p>As the scenery shifted,
a smile spread across Natsuki’s face. “I thought so,” she said,
resuming her ministrations of Shizuru’s breasts.</p><p>A blush spread to
Shizuru’s face at her current predicament. As soon as the fantasy
of being restrained by Natsuki occurred to her, she’d found herself
experiencing it in her dream. Maybe she did have some control, even
if that control led to her letting Natsuki take over. Taking a
steadying breath, she was able to pant out through the periodic
bursts of pleasure, “What… is this… Natsuki?”</p><p>“Heh,” Natsuki
said, smiling a mischievous grin at her. “Remember last week when I
talked about the work I did in taming your… let’s call it your
more animalistic side? Well, I just wanted to see how the two of you
were getting along. I was a bit worried that she might lead to some
darker impulses in you, but I didn’t notice any of that.”</p><p>Natsuki removed her
hands from Shizuru’s breasts and came up to give the restrained a
girl a sweet kiss. As they parted, she continued, “Now, the
alternative to that was that she’d latch onto your more sexual
side, and start feeding you some interesting fantasies. I’m not too
surprised that she started to like being tied up after the work I did
with her, but I suspect she’ll also have quite a thing for more
dominant fantasies.”</p><p>At the simple
suggestion of dominant fantasies, an image of Natsuki tied up on her
bed and completely at her mercy flashed through Shizuru’s mind.<i>Dominant 
indeed…</i></p><p>Natsuki tilted her head
at Shizuru, and Shizuru got the sudden sensation that the girl could
read her thoughts. “What do you know, I guessed right.” Another
blush filled Shizuru’s face at the realization that her mind was
completely exposed to this girl – even if this Natsuki was just
another part of her own mind.</p><p>A sudden sensation of
freedom filled Shizuru. Finding that the restraints on her wrists had
disappeared, Shizuru instinctively brought her arms around Natsuki’s
back to hold onto her. She smiled up at the girl. “Thank you,
Natsuki, for helping me sort out all of these things.”</p><p>Natsuki chuckled at
this. “Of course, Shizuru. That’s what dreams are for, after all.
It’s also one of the many things a girlfriend is for.” Natsuki
brought her hands up to hold Shizuru’s head, allowing her body to
come to rest lying on top of Shizuru’s. She gazed into Shizuru’s
eyes as she continued, the mischievous glint in her own returning.
“And of course, I know that the real Natsuki isn’t going to be
able to handle all of your fantasies right away. So if anything is
really bugging you, I’ll be happy to help you out there.”</p><p>“Ara?” Shizuru
said. “What happened to Dream Natsuki being so reluctant to do
anything with me until Real Natsuki did?”</p><p>“Meh. I just didn’t
want to spoil your first time with her,” Natsuki explained. Her
gaze softened into loving adoration for Shizuru as she said this. The
sight of love in Natsuki’s eyes made Shizuru’s heart jump in her
chest. “I’m also a little limited in what sensations I can
provide you with before you’ve experienced them in reality, sadly.
So I won’t be able to help you out completely with all of your
fantasies, but I should be able to help take the edge off until
Natsuki is ready.”</p><p>With a thankful smile,
Shizuru brought her head up to give Natsuki a quick kiss. “Dream
Natsuki is too sweet.” A sudden wet feeling on her nipple grabbed
Shizuru’s attention. It felt very much like Natsuki was kissing it,
though her mouth was nowhere nearby. “And she seems to have
developed a second mouth. I didn’t know I fantasized about that,
but I guess it could come in handy.”</p><p>“Hmm? I’m not…”
Natsuki trailed off, and an amused smile formed on her face.
“Something tells me you might want to wake up for this.”</p><p>Shizuru barely had time
to quirk an eyebrow before the world around her started to fade. As
awareness returned to her, she was back on Natsuki’s bed, cradling
the girl against her breast as she had been when she’d fallen
asleep. The biggest difference now was that Natsuki’s right hand
had taken hold of Shizuru’s left breast and brought it to the
girl’s mouth, where she was lightly suckling on it as she slept.</p><p><i>Ara… this is just
too cute,</i> Shizuru thought as she gazed over Natsuki. The suckling
was starting to cause a distracting warmth to grow in her chest, but
Natsuki’s adorable behavior as she slept was worth any amount of
discomfort. Being kept up all night by Natsuki doing cute things in
her sleep didn’t strike Shizuru as a bad prospect at all.</p><p>Natsuki didn’t seem
content to simply kiss Shizuru’s breast all night, though. Her head
pulled back from the breast, her hand coming in to play with the
nipple in her mouth’s absence. She squirmed a bit in their embrace,
managing to push her head up past Shizuru’s breasts. “…zuru…”
she mumbled out a soft sound, probably an attempt at her lover’s
name.</p><p>Shizuru let out a soft
whimper, Natsuki’s cute mumbling and the fondling of her breast
overwhelming her desire to be quiet lest she risk waking the girl up.
Natsuki’s behavior was starting to stir a desire in her chest.
Perhaps it hadn’t been such a good idea to let her go to sleep
without returning the favor. Shizuru hadn’t expected Natsuki to
enjoy pleasuring her as much as she did doing so to Natsuki, but
perhaps she’d underestimated her girlfriend’s desire for her.</p><p>“Love… zuru…”
More mumbled words came out of Natsuki’s mouth, their intent
sending a wave of warmth through Shizuru’s body. Natsuki’s face
was so cute, sleepily facing towards Shizuru that she just couldn’t
hold herself back any longer. She brought a hand around to Natsuki’s
head to gently tilt it backwards a bit more as she tilted her own
head down to meet her girlfriend’s lips with her own.</p><p>Natsuki’s lips moved
lazily against Shizuru’s, but they definitely were responding. It
was the first time Shizuru had taken advantage of Natsuki’s
permission to kiss her in her sleep, and it was truly heartwarming to
know that her kiss was welcomed. <i>If you’ve come this far,
Natsuki, then I really should have no worries. But I’ll never
forget how much of a blessing you are to me and how lucky I am to
finally have you. Thank you so much, Natsuki.</i></p><p>After a minute, Shizuru
withdrew her lips from Natsuki’s to take a much needed breath of
air. Looking down at her lover, Shizuru was pleased to see that she
was still sound asleep. This fortunately didn’t stop her from
mumbling out another “zuru,” though, as the sweet love in the
girl’s voice made Shizuru’s heart do leaps in her chest.</p><p>It seemed that, in her
most innocent state, all Natsuki could think about was Shizuru. There
was nothing more Natsuki needed to do to prove her love to Shizuru.
Everything from this point on would simply be celebrating and
enjoying their love. Apparently, Natsuki had just on her mind as she
slept, though, as she proceeded to increase the intensity of her
fondling of Shizuru’s breast, her squeezes bordering on painful.
Her head crept forward and she started gently kissing Shizuru’s
chest.</p><p>Shizuru was frozen with
a moment of concern when Natsuki’s intent became clear. Was it
alright for her to let her girlfriend do this to her while she slept?
It wasn’t like she was doing it to Natsuki and forcing her into it
in her sleep, though at this point she doubted her girlfriend would
mind even that. It was probably alright, then. In any case, she just
couldn’t resist the thought of making love to the sleeping angel
that lay in bed with her. If Natsuki was being this sweet, there was
no way she could refuse, even if it was in her sleep.</p><p>Natsuki seemed to sense
as Shizuru relaxed into her ministrations. She began kissing her way
down Shizuru’s chest, matching the rhythm of Shizuru’s panting
with her pecks. Eventually, her kisses made their way to the tip of
Shizuru’s breast, where her hand was still busy massaging the
nipple. Her hand released it at last, causing a wave of sweet pain to
fill Shizuru’s breast as the pressure on it was finally relieved.</p><p>Natsuki’s mouth
started laying kisses over Shizuru’s breast, as if she were
apologizing for her hand’s previous rough treatment of it. Somehow,
she was able to find all the spots where the aching was building up,
using her kisses to turn the soreness into a pleasant warmth.
Eventually she reached the Shizuru’s nipple, which had built up
quite a bit of pain from Natsuki’s earlier pinching. All this pain
was released now, pouring out into Natsuki’s mouth as Shizuru’s
body was flooded with warmth.</p><p>Shizuru let out a deep
moan as she felt her body melting into Natsuki’s loving touch.
Natsuki had returned to sweetly suckling on her breast, though it was
having quite a more significant effect on Shizuru now, in her
heightened state of arousal. With her mouth in a steady, loving
action, Natsuki’s hand took over the work of pushing Shizuru even
higher. It trailed its way down Shizuru’s side, eliciting a yelp
from the girl when it passed over the sensitive spot where her HiME
mark had been.</p><p>Natsuki’s fingers
stopped their downward path to circle around this spot, sending a
steady stream of pleasure through Shizuru’s body. It felt like
Natsuki had hooked up an electrical current to the spot, and she was
now charging up Shizuru’s body with a pleasure just waiting to be
released. Shizuru’s breath became unsteady as the waves of pleasure
started bouncing erratically around her body. It was all she could do
to stop herself from crying out loud to release some of the tension,
but she couldn’t afford to wake Natsuki up now.</p><p>This wasn’t a concern
for Natsuki, however, as she continued building up the sexual charge
in Shizuru. It reached the point where Shizuru couldn’t possibly
hold herself back from moaning, so she bit down on her lips to
release her moans as quietly as she could into her mouth. Perhaps the
restrained noise filtered down into Natsuki’s dreaming mind, as she
finally removed her hand from this spot, allowing Shizuru a much
needed chance to catch her breath.</p><p>Her break wasn’t to
last long, though, as Natsuki’s hand slowly made its way farther
down her body. Shizuru barely had time to reflect on how the
experience was starting to get a bit surreal – could Natsuki really
be doing all of this in her sleep? – before the contact of
Natsuki’s hand with sensitive, wet flesh made her lose all
conscious thought.</p><p>Natsuki’s previous
behavior had gotten Shizuru so aroused that there was no resistance
to the entrance of her fingers. They slipped easily into the wet
folds of her core, quickly seeking out the tight bundle of nerves
contained within. A sharp bolt of pleasure lanced through Shizuru’s
body as Natsuki’s fingers made contact with her clit, causing her
to involuntarily let out a yelp. She’d lost enough presence of mind
to worry about waking up Natsuki; she could only think about enjoying
the ride her lover was taking her on.</p><p>It took only a couple
of seconds for Natsuki’s fingers to massage the nub into an erect
state. The constant bursts of pleasure from her motions had Shizuru
letting out a moan with every breath. The pleasurable charge Natsuki
had built up in her kept growing, forcing her to strain every muscle
in her body against an irresistible force. All the while, Natsuki’s
mouth was gently suckling on Shizuru’s nipple, anchoring her in the
depths of pleasure. A small part in the back of Shizuru’s mind idly
wondered how it could be possible for the girl to drive her wild so
effortlessly that she remained asleep through all of it.</p><p>After what seemed like
hours playing with Shizuru’s clit between her fingers, Natsuki
slowly allowed them to drift deeper into Shizuru’s slit. Just as
her thumb came in send another jolt of pleasure through Shizuru’s
clit, she felt Natsuki’s fingers start to probe her opening.
Shizuru instinctively wrapped her arms across Natsuki’s back and
pulled her lover tightly into her chest as her fingers made their way
inside her body.</p><p>Shizuru was so wet that
Natsuki was easily able to shove her index and middle fingers in
together right away. Their presence gave Shizuru a much-craved
feeling of being filled up by her love. When Natsuki’s fingers
started sliding their way in and out, all the pleasure that had built
up in Shizuru started to pulse in rhythm with them. Shizuru felt
herself being hit by wave after wave of energy which shot up from
Natsuki’s fingers, a moan bursting its way out of her mouth with
each pulse.</p><p>Natsuki’s pace
gradually picked up, and her fingers thrust deeper into Shizuru. They
started to pass over a tender spot deep inside, which forced a wave
of shudders through Shizuru with each pass. Soon the speed picked up
to the point where Shizuru was shuddering constantly, and the
pleasure built up past her ability to handle it.</p><p>There was no turning
back now. Shizuru knew she had mere moments before she exploded in
pleasure. Trying to make the moment perfect, she strained to open her
eyes and look down upon the beautiful face of her beloved.
Miraculously, Natsuki’s face still held an expression of utter
bliss as she slept, her lips still wrapped tenderly around Shizuru’s
nipple.</p><p>The image of Natsuki’s
angelic face imprinted itself on Shizuru’s mind as she lost touch
with reality. Every nerve in her body exploded with sweet ecstasy,
the entire charge within her releasing at once in every direction. A
scream tore its way out of her throat as all of her muscles tensed
up, her arms squeezing her lover desperately against her.</p><p>Shizuru’s muscles
jerked in periodic bursts as she started to fall back to earth.
Everything felt unsteady, but her tight embrace on Natsuki kept her
anchored. Her sweet lover helped her drift gently back down, soothing
utterances of “zuru” filtering their way into her mind. As she
finally bottomed out and her body filled with the sweet warmth of
afterglow from her orgasm, the voice started to gain a bit of
coherence at last. “…zuru… Shizuru… Shizuru?”</p><p>Shizuru glanced down,
finding that Natsuki had turned her face upwards, her eyes lazily
opening. Apparently the force of her orgasm was enough to finally
wake the girl up. Now she was looking up questioningly at Shizuru as
her mind tried to piece together what had happened. “Shizuru…”
she said after another moment. “Did I just… you…?</p><p>The expression on the
girl’s face was just irresistible. She still looked perfectly cute
and innocent after all of the naughty things she’d done to her
girlfriend. Shizuru delayed answering her for a few seconds as she
leaned her head down to give her lover a kiss of thanks. Natsuki’s
lips tentatively moved back against hers once they met, though she
was obviously still quite sleepy and confused.</p><p>Once she pulled back
from the kiss, Shizuru gave Natsuki a loving, thankful smile, and
answered her question, “Yes you did, Natsuki, and thank you. You
started being very sweet in your sleep, and there was no way I could
resist you.”</p><p>“Ah,” Natsuki said
as a blush made its way to her cheeks. “I thought so. I’m
starting to recognize that look in your face.” She quirked a lazy
smile at Shizuru.</p><p>“Ara? And what look
is this, Natsuki?”</p><p>“Well,” Natsuki
started to say. She scooted her way up in Shizuru’s embrace so she
could lay her head on the pillow and look straight into her
girlfriend’s eyes. “There’s that beautiful blush you get, which
seems to come most easily when you’re aroused. Then there are the
tear tracks down your face, and I don’t think you have any reason
to be upset right now. On top of all that, you just seem to be
glowing with happiness.”</p><p>“Ara…” Shizuru
felt a grin spreading its way across her face. “I have reason to be
happy, with such a considerate, sweet, and loving girlfriend who’s
getting to know me so well.”</p><p>Natsuki gave a sleepy
smile back at Shizuru. She moved her head forward to give Shizuru a
quick peck on the nose, causing a quick wave of warmth to spread to
her cheeks. “And I’d like to get to know you even better,
Shizuru. I want to know every little thing about you, and everything
I can do to drive you wild.”</p><p>“Aw, and I’d like
to know everything about you too, Natsuki,” Shizuru said, and she
returned her girlfriend’s kiss to the nose. “One thing in
particular on my mind right now is: what were you dreaming about just
now? And who is this ‘Zuru’ person you kept mentioning in your
sleep?”</p><p>Natsuki stuck her
tongue out playfully. “Take a wild guess.”</p><p>“Hmm…” Shizuru
brought a finger up to her chin and took her contemplative pose. “Is
Natsuki having fantasies about another girl? Natsuki no ikezu!” She
put on her hurt expression now. It never failed to tug on Natsuki’s
heartstrings, even in cases like this where she was obviously joking.</p><p>Sure enough, 
Natsuki
winced slightly at Shizuru’s expression, but she quickly recovered.
“No, I was dreaming about you, Shi<i>zuru</i>,” she said,
sticking her tongue out again. “I found myself in bed with you when
I started dreaming, kind of like how we are now. We were chatting and
cuddling, and you asked me if I wanted to repay the favor for you.
You’d been stroking me quite seductively through the talking, so
uh…”</p><p>Natsuki’s cheeks lit
up red as she trailed off, and her eyes dropped from Shizuru’s. The
cute sight made a smile split across Shizuru’s face. It was quite
nice to know that Natsuki still had enough modesty left in moments
like these that Shizuru wouldn’t be denied the sight of her lovely
blush. “So Natsuki couldn’t resist jumping on her Dream Shizuru?”</p><p>“Er, yeah,” Natsuki
said, her blush deepening. “And I guess that in order to pay you
back, my subconscious must have made me do all of that to you in
reality as well…”</p><p>Shizuru’s glee was
threatening to overwhelm her. Natsuki had just done too many cute
things tonight, and the embarrassed blush as she explained her dream
was pushing her over the edge. Shizuru brought a hand up to Natsuki’s
chin, and after a bit of gentle pressure the girl brought her gaze
back up to Shizuru’s eyes. “Thank you, Natsuki,” she said
softly. “You’ve just fulfilled a fantasy I didn’t even know I
had.”</p><p>“N-no problem…”
Natsuki said. She seemed to be sinking into a trance under Shizuru’s
gaze. Shizuru mused that it was quite fair, given how easily Natsuki
was able to enchant her when she got it in her mind to. It was just
unfortunate that it was so late and they both still needed a good
night’s sleep, or she might have tried to see if Natsuki was ready
to help with another fantasy or two.</p><p>That didn’t mean she
couldn’t set things up for the morning, though. “Natsuki?”
Shizuru said softly, trying to keep her lover in as much of a trance
as possible. “What do you think about making tomorrow all about us?
Just you and me all day, to do whatever we want with each other.”</p><p>Natsuki blinked back 
at
her sleepily. She was probably starting to fall back asleep, which
was definitely helping with keeping her under Shizuru’s spell.
“Yeah…” she said, her word fading into a yawn. As her eyes
drifted closed, she pulled herself closer to Shizuru and nestled her
head into Shizuru’s neck. “I’d like that.”</p><p>Shizuru brought her
hand up and gently stroked Natsuki’s hair, trailing her hand down
the girl’s back a bit before returning it to her head and repeating
the process. “Thank you, Natsuki. Sleep well.”</p><p>“You too,” Natsuki
mumbled. “Love you …zuru.” A light blush formed on Shizuru’s
cheeks at the sound of Natsuki’s new sleepy nickname for her. It
might not have much meaning behind it, like other nicknames they
might come up with for each other in the future, but it made up for
that with cuteness.</p><p>“I love you too,
Natsuki,” she said as she allowed herself to relax into her lover’s
embrace and drift off to sleep.</p>
