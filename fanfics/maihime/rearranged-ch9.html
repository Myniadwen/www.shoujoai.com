<h1>Rearranged (part 9 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a>

<a href="../maihime/rearranged-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>The street behind the Fujino residence was quiet and empty when Natsuki 
arrived. While not entirely dark due to the street lamps intermittently 
spaced along the sidewalk, there were still enough shadowy areas around 
for her to stay concealed. She parked her bike at a distance before 
making her way to the gate. Now it was just a waiting game: someone 
would have to leave or enter the gate in order for her to have a chance 
to slip through. At this time of night, it was more likely that someone 
would be leaving the house, having finished their work for the day.

So Natsuki waited. It was nearly an hour before her ears detected the 
sound of an engine approaching, and she was chilled to the bone from the 
frigid night air. The gate began to open, and she readied herself. A 
small, compact car exited, and luckily turned in the opposite direction 
of Natsuki when it got onto the street. Also fortunately for Natsuki, 
the gate was somewhat slow to shut, and she was able to dash inside 
before it closed.

Now inside the grounds, she stayed close to the wall in the shadows as 
she scoped out her surroundings. From her position she could see the 
back of the mansion. There were several doors along the back of the 
house, one of them less conspicuous than the others and probably used by 
the staff. A few guards were patrolling the yard, but they were at a 
fair distance from her. The fact that the land between Natsuki and the 
house was mostly wooded enabled her to sneak up to the back wall without 
being detected. Crouching down behinds some bushes, she crept up to the 
door. Trying the handle, she was surprised to find it unlocked. Whoever 
had left most recently must have forgotten to lock up. They probably 
weren&#39;t accustomed to break-ins very often, if ever, so such a slip-up 
wasn&#39;t to be entirely unexpected.

Once she&#39;d slipped inside, Natsuki noted that she was in some sort of 
locker room/lounge for the various employees who worked at the estate. 
There were couches and chairs, as well as bathrooms and changing rooms. 
Several garment racks lined the wall, with various uniforms hanging from 
them. Natsuki looked down at her current attire; the black leather 
bodysuit she wore when riding her motorcycle wasn&#39;t exactly the most low 
profile type of clothing to wear while walking through the interior of a 
house. She eyed the maid uniforms on the rack, letting out a sigh as she 
picked out one that looked to be her size and went into a changing room.

She emerged from the room, fully dressed in her new ensemble, and looked 
at herself in a mirror. The dress was black with white lace trim and 
short, puffy sleeves. The neck was scooped and the short skirt rested 
atop a poofed white petticoat. A white pinafore tied around her waist 
and she wore long white gloves that went just past her elbows. The look 
was completed by black stockings and black heels. The women who work 
here actually wear this? She wondered to herself, blushing at her 
appearance.

There wasn&#39;t time to linger, so Natsuki went to the door that led to the 
rest of the house. She peeped her head out, looking down the hall both 
ways and saw that the coast was clear. So far it had been fairly easy 
for her to get in, but she knew that she was bound to come across 
someone before too long. She quickly made her way down the hallway, 
being careful to stay as quiet as she possibly could. Though she didn&#39;t 
really know where she was going, she knew she had to head up to the 
second floor where Shizuru&#39;s bedroom was. For now, that was where she 
was assuming Shizuru was being kept.

Natsuki passed a closed door, behind which she could hear the clanking 
and clattering of dishes and pots and pans. The kitchen. She realized 
with excitement that the dining room must be fairly close; she knew how 
to get to Shizuru&#39;s room from there. She hurried her pace.

A woman&#39;s voice behind her halted her steps, &quot;Hey you! Stop right 
there!&quot;

Natsuki turned around. The door to the kitchen had opened and a woman 
also dressed in a maid&#39;s uniform was leaning out of it.

&quot;I need you to help me, so come here,&quot; the woman said to her.

She thinks I work here, whew, I&#39;m glad I decided to change clothes, 
Natsuki thought to herself as she walked over to the woman. Natsuki 
noticed she was looking at her strangely and she began to get nervous.

&quot;Eh? I&#39;ve never seen you before. What&#39;s your name?&quot; the woman asked.

&quot;Uh, I&#39;m Ku...gawa. Kugawa Nat...sume. I&#39;m new here,&quot; Natsuki stuttered.

&quot;Kugawa Natsume huh? Well, I heard we were going to get someone new, but 
I didn&#39;t know they were already hired. Anyway, come in here Kugawa-san, 
I need you to help me carry some things.&quot;

Woah, that was a close one. Relieved that the woman had bought her 
story, she followed her into the kitchen. Several trays were laid out on 
the counter with what appeared to be someone&#39;s dinner.

&quot;Alright, grab one of these trays and help me take it upstairs,&quot; she 
told Natsuki.

Complying, Natsuki took one and followed the other maid.

&quot;Who are we taking this to?&quot; she asked her curiously.

&quot;Oh, well the ojou-sama&#39;s been confined to her room lately, so we&#39;ve 
been having to take her meals up to her.&quot;

We&#39;re going to Shizuru&#39;s room! What luck! Hmmm, maybe I should get some 
more information from this woman.

&quot;Why is she being confined to her room?&quot; Natsuki asked innocently.

&quot;You mean you haven&#39;t heard about it yet? I thought everyone knew. 
Anyway, one of the maids was passing by the ojou-sama&#39;s room last night 
and heard some noises inside. I guess she stopped and listened some 
more&#151;turns out the ojou was having sex with her friend. And what&#39;s more, 
it was her female friend.&quot;

Natsuki nearly dropped her tray, her face was bright red.

&quot;Hey! Be careful with that, we&#39;d have some big trouble on our hands if 
you dropped it.&quot;

&quot;Uh, yeah, sorry. I&#39;ll be more careful.&quot;

&quot;Please do. Where was I? Oh yeah, so the maid told the head maid, and 
then the head maid told Mr. Fujino. I guess he was pretty angry about it 
and he told the ojou that she couldn&#39;t see or talk to her friend any 
more and he&#39;s been keeping her shut up in her room since then. 
Apparently he took away her phone too. Things have been pretty tense 
around here. Not to mention the ojou isn&#39;t happy about the current 
arrangements at all. She&#39;s tried to force her way out of her room 
several times, and has been giving the guards a hell of a time.&quot;

&quot;Guards?&quot; asked Natsuki, the anger evident in her voice.

&quot;Yes, the guards. Hey, are you ok?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Natsuki replied, trying to sound cheery. The other 
woman seemed satisfied and they continued down the hall. By now they 
were on the second floor and heading for Shizuru&#39;s bedroom. As they 
neared it, Natsuki could see two men standing in front of the door with 
weary looks on their faces.

&quot;We&#39;re here to bring the ojou-sama her dinner,&quot; said the woman to the 
two guards.

&quot;Alright, go ahead inside, but be careful&#151;she&#39;s being extremely 
difficult,&quot; one of them said.

He unlocked the door and let them in. When they entered, Shizuru was 
sitting off to the right side of the room in her armchair with her head 
leaned back and her eyes closed. Her hand was holding her forehead as if 
she had a headache.

&quot;Just set it on the table and leave,&quot; she said, without opening her 
eyes.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; said the other woman as she went to the table to set down 
her tray.

&quot;As you wish, ma&#39;am,&quot; said Natsuki, watching as Shizuru&#39;s eyes snapped 
open at the sound of her voice. Their eyes met and time seemed to stand 
still. Natsuki saw Shizuru mouth her name silently, her face wearing a 
shocked expression.

The trance was broken when the maid cleared her throat and said, 
&quot;Kugawa-san...the tray please?&quot;

Natsuki tore her gaze from Shizuru and took her tray over to the table 
as well.

&quot;Please enjoy your dinner miss, we&#39;ll be leaving now,&quot; said the maid.

&quot;Wait,&quot; Shizuru said. &quot;I&#39;d like the girl with you to stay here, I wish 
to talk with her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry ma&#39;am, but we really must go. We aren&#39;t allowed-&quot;

&quot;Let her stay, or I will be very, very displeased,&quot; said Shizuru in a 
quiet, yet intimidating tone.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; said the other maid nervously, giving Natsuki a look that 
said &#39;be careful&#39; as she walked to the door.

The door shut, and the woman&#39;s voice could be heard as she explained to 
the guards why &#39;Kugawa-san&#39; was still in the room. She was soon 
forgotten, however, as Shizuru and Natsuki went to each other.

&quot;I knew you&#39;d come,&quot; whispered Shizuru into the other girl&#39;s neck as 
they embraced. She pulled back and let her eyes roam over Natsuki&#39;s 
uniform-clad body.

&quot;Ara? Natsuki-chan looks so adorable, is this for me?&quot;

&quot;Shizuru,&quot; Natsuki pleaded, &quot;this is no time for joking, we need to get 
out of here, and fast.&quot; She walked over to the window and looked 
down&#151;they were definitely too high to exit that way. That left only one 
other way: back out the door and past the guards.

&quot;Alright Shizuru,&quot; she said, &quot;I have a plan...&quot;</pre>
