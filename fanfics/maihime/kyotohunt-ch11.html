August, 2915

Ten year old Fumi Himeno was restless. The trip had been so long, going 
on for as long as she could remember. Everyone was in a state of 
excitement now, or at least the older folks who had been adults when the 
trip started. The nine year voyage had taken its toll on the occupants 
of the colony ships, and all were anxious to see the new world, hoping 
to start anew after leaving the ruined home world. For Fumi and the 
other students of the Dammerung Academy, they didn&#39;t understand the big 
deal. The ship was home to them. Never the less, curiosity got the 
better of them, and they found themselves embracing the same excitement 
their adult handlers did.

Her eleven other classmates had their faces pressed to the large 
panoramic window so they could see the large blue sphere they&#39;d thus far 
unofficially named &#39;Earl.&#39; Mikoto, the dark haired energetic child, and 
Victoria, an equally rambunctious girl, seemed to be entertained for 
hours on end by the approaching orb. Fumi was, however, unimpressed 
after about a half an hour. She wandered towards her handlers, who were 
too busy discussing things to pay any attention to her.

She&#39;d always wondered what Earth looked like. She heard both wonderful 
and frightening stories from the adults. It was all because of the old 
leader&#39;s failed plans at paradise. They wanted a new golden age. The 
Golden Millennium, she had heard, was a time of unrivaled peace just 
after the Ice Age on Earth had ended, when man was young. Civilizations 
were ruled by their warrior princesses, bestowed power by a great 
Obsidian Lord. It ended when the princesses were forced to fight each 
other until only one stood. That had largely been the fate of the Second 
Golden Millennium.

The older leaders of their Foundation had tried to repeat that golden 
era by offering the nations of Earth a single Otome warrior to handle 
all military operations. Armies were disbanded. War ended. It had looked 
like it would work. Like the original Golden Millennium, however, the 
Otome were forced to fight, and ended up entirely decimating the planet. 
People were forced to flee all over the nearby star systems to avoid 
certain death. Those left behind on Earth were left to nuclear winter 
and poisoned oceans.

&quot;No contact from the other ships at all,&quot; her handler remarked. &quot;They 
may have made it to their colonies, but simply lost contact due to 
damaged parts.&quot;

&quot;A shame,&quot; his coworker said. &quot;I suppose we&#39;ll find out in due time. 
What&#39;s the ETA for our landing?&quot;

&quot;Thirty minutes.&quot; Her handler looked up at the other man for a moment 
before saying, &quot;Schwartz already activated the Global Z-HiME System, 
right? So we won&#39;t have to use the Emulator?&quot;

&quot;They said they did.&quot; They referred to the artificial HiME star orbiting 
the moon of the new colony world, sent there by Schwartz, the recently 
reformed and reorganized Searrs Foundation. &quot;Are the new GEMs ready?&quot;

&quot;The original five are still being augmented to get rid of that 
programming error.&quot; The &#39;minor&#39; problem that had caused the original 
Fire String Ruby user to go ballistic, she recalled. It wasn&#39;t a simple 
fluke, unfortunately. Most of the X-Type HiME version of the Otome had 
contracted psychosis from faulty construction. It was largely the reason 
for the devastation on Earth. &quot;We&#39;re basing the new programming off the 
Diamond, of course.&quot;

The other man nodded sagely. &quot;Of course. Upgrading the X-Type GEMs to 
Z-Type has taken a bit of time, but it will certainly be worth it. The 
flight ability based off of the Kagutsuchi users&#39; Inferno Spiral weapons 
will come in handy, in particular. Banishing the psychotic outbreak 
issue goes without saying.&quot;

&quot;All the cadets on this boat are HiME Heirs, just in case the new 
nanomachines don&#39;t take. Hopefully they will be the last of the HiME 
bloodlines before the old ways are completely phased out,&quot; her handler 
said. &quot;I don&#39;t know if any HiME powers will kick in, but be sure to 
watch for them. Minagi over there had high readings.&quot;

&quot;Yes, we were already briefed by headquarters,&quot; the other replied. 
&quot;We&#39;ll keep an eye out. How are the other GEMs coming along?&quot;

&quot;Aside from upgrading the original five, we have the Malachite and the 
Jasper in development. The others are still in the planning stages, 
unfortunately &#150; held up by the collapse of Searrs, you know.&quot; Her 
handler chuckled dryly and looked back, shocked to see Fumi there. His 
expression changed, and he formed a false smile on his lips. &quot;Hi, Fumi! 
How&#39;s it going?&quot;

&quot;Just fine, thank you.&quot; She made mental notes about their entire 
conversation, and he seemed embarrassed to have not noticed her for so 
long. She was good at staying out of the way.

&quot;Is this the one, then?&quot; The other man asked. Fumi rose an eyebrow. Ah, 
yes. She was &#39;special.&#39;

&quot;Yeah. Gonna be the first Z-Type,&quot; her handler praised. He rummaged 
through a bag and pulled out a locked box. Deactivating the security 
equipment on it, he pulled out a brilliant white gem, and held it up for 
her. &quot;This will be yours, when you get a bit older. It&#39;s the Pure White 
Diamond. Cool, huh?&quot;

Fumi nodded once. &quot;Yes, it&#39;s beautiful. May I see it?&quot;

Her handler snatched it back. &quot;I don&#39;t know about that. You&#39;re still 
young. This isn&#39;t just a pretty toy. Maybe in a few years. 
Materialization training begins at fourteen, so you&#39;ve got a little ways 
to go. Why don&#39;t you rejoin Mikoto and the others? You won&#39;t be seeing 
that view again. Best enjoy it when you can.&quot;

That was his simple way of telling her to get lost. She nodded again, 
and turned back towards the large window, walking up to the others and 
giving the adults their privacy. She placed her hand on the glass, 
hearing the other chat. Her eyes were fixed on the deep blue oceans, 
their landing and the end to their long voyage finally at a close. Earth 
and the ways of the old were gone. Now, there was only hope for the 
future.

Without the sins of the past and their ancestors weighing them down, and 
on a new world, all options were open to them. There, standing amongst 
her eleven classmates, Fumi could merely ponder what the new future 
would bring to them.</pre>
