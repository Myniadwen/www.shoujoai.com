<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akira  grimaced as she swung down from the tree and landed on the bear’s  back, crushing its delicate spine with a sickening <em>crunch. </em>As  she landed, she bent her knees to absorb the impact, though it wasn’t  really necessary; the layer of fur and fat that violently collapsed  on itself, shedding blood in a hundred places as the bear gave off a  last, dying roar was sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As she  wiped a layer of blood off her brow, shielded in part by the black  cloth of her hood, Akira thought, <em>parts of this chapter may be  considered violent or cruel. </em></span></p>

</em>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sooner or  Later</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It could  have been said that Natsuki Kuga had a hard time coping with certain  aspects of life that most people found relatively routine.  For  example, indecision; a feeling that most people have acquainted  themselves with at one point or another, the feeling of being pulled  one way by all points of logic but entirely another way by that  little voice in the back of your head that says precisely the  opposite of what reason tells you, and speaking so convincingly that  you can’t bring yourself to disregard it. <em>No, you don’t </em>really <em>need to eat anything right now, because you’re not</em> really <em>in the mood for chicken. Go on, take the last candy. Nobody  will miss it, least of all, the person whose name is on it.  No, you </em>should <em>argue with him. He’s an asshole.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  had a hard time dealing with indecision. Most of the choices she had  been presented in her life had been relatively simple: Avenge her  mother’s death or feel regret for the rest of her life.  Kill or  die. Fight or fall back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The <em>really </em>hard decisions always had something to do with the only  person who had ever put turbulence into her life: Shizuru Fujino.  These were the questions that had no immediate answer to her, because  she wasn’t really even certain what the choices were. What did she  want from Shizuru? That depended on what Shizuru wanted from her.  What did Shizuru mean to her? That depended on who was asking, and on  what day of the astrological calendar they asked on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">These  questions had no simple solution in Natsuki’s mind, but there was  one fairly straightforward fix that she had learned of not long ago  to prevent them from overwhelming her consciousness whenever they got  too pushy, demanding an answer <em>now damnit</em>: To push them aside  with all her might, and focus on whatever else was around her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When she  thought about it very closely, there was only one really difficult  Shizuru-related decision that she had ever made easily.  In Goza,  when Shizuru had been kidnapped, the choice had been simple to her:  Shizuru had been kidnapped, so Natsuki had to put her own life on the  line to rescue her. Fight or flee? Fight. It was usually fight.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not this  time, though.  This time, there was no fight. There was no easy fix,  and there was no pushing it aside.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Because  Shizuru had touched her. And more than that, she had kissed her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  Natsuki wasn’t sure whether she wanted that or not. She had never  thought seriously on the matter, simply because she had spent most of  that time forcing the thoughts from her head, rather than addressing  them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Because  when she didn’t,<em> this </em>was what happened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Blank  stare. Inability to respond coherently. If anybody had tried to  attack her, they’d have found her reflexes sluggish, at best.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  short, nearly useless.  In her own mind, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the  end, it all boiled down to the fact that she was most comfortable  when she was fighting, and that when she wasn’t, she didn’t know  quite what to do with herself.  Violence was a drug (see A/N below)—she knew that  better than anybody else at that camp, except for possibly Minoru.  You could use it to replace parts of your life, but once you got  hooked on it, you didn’t know how to live without it, and it  required many years of rehabilitation to break yourself of the habit,  though you never really dropped it altogether.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe  that was why the first gunshot that echoed through the forest, over  the lake, and into the ears of everybody in the camp was so effective  at waking her up: It was like getting her fix; once she got it, she  could more or less function again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  gunshot, a booming, resounding <em>crack</em>, turned the heads of  everybody at the camp, as loud, unexpected noises are wont to do. It  echoed off of the lake so that it seemed to come from everywhere at  once, but even so, everybody’s head turned to precisely the same  point in the woods.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Everybody’s  but Natsuki’s. Natsuki didn’t need to look uselessly at an  unrevealing line of trees to know that sound; it was a sound she had  heard plenty of times before. Just never quite this <em>big. </em>She  had no idea what kind of gun had just fired, but she was guessing it  wasn’t legal in <em>any </em>country, let alone in Japan, where she  could be arrested just for being seen <em>near </em>her pistol.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  pistol, currently inside the cabin, resting comfortably and safely  inside her bag.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Inside  the cabin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  Shizuru.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A moment  later, she began to register the world again, her indecision  shattered by the reintroduction of violence into her life.  The first  thing she heard was, strangely enough, Yuuichi: “Where’s Shiho?”  he was asking everybody.  She turned her head briefly towards him,  and then turned away, regretting it: She hadn’t seen a man with so  ashen a face since…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Since  a long time ago.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t ponder it further.  It bothered her, but what <em>really </em>bothered her was the look on Mai’s face, next to her.  Mai,  Natsuki knew, lost no sleep over Shiho by herself—not over the  halfway-psychotic girl who had very nearly separated her and Yuuichi  on more than one occasion, on quite possibly a permanent basis.  Mai  was a kind, forgiving person, but kindness only went so far, and  typically nowhere near far enough to catch a glimpse of where  jealousy ended.  Mai’s concern for Shiho had, in Natsuki’s  opinion, a more pragmatic root: Yuuichi still cared very deeply for  the misguided little girl, and if she was Tate’s concern, then she  was, at some level, Mai’s concern as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What  bothered her was really Mai’s face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Torn.  One side hurting for Yuuichi, the other for herself; staring halfway  between Yuuichi’s head and the sunset, with a concerned expression  that gave way to hurt eyes, one hand supportively on Yuuichi’s  shoulder, the other pulled tightly to her stomach.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Torn.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki’s  instinct, therefore, pulled her towards her gun, and towards battle.  Towards her inevitable route of sacrificing her safety for the  sometimes dim hope of securing somebody else’s; but there was still  that one thing standing between her and her gun; the same thing that  stood between her and the rest of the world:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru.  Just the thought of her niggled at Natstuki, rooting her feet to the  spot. It would have been easier for Natsuki to shoot her way through  a dozen First District soldiers than to walk in there now, to get her  gun and do what was necessary. Hell, given the choice, she probably  would have opted to take the soldiers bare-handed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  also absolutely certain that this information, vital intelligence if  ever it existed, could never fall into Shizuru’s hands, for fear of  her swift, harsh</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Kiyohime.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">retribution</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>One  word should never be able to cause so very much destruction.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another  gunshot.  The first she might have been able to explain away as a  firecracker, but this one was closer, and punctuated by a sharp,  short noise--the unmistakable sound of a human in mortal pain,  pleading in a single, unintelligible syllable, for help.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No.  There’s another word. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  shook her head. No point in thinking about it. Really, that was when  she did her best work anyway, was when she didn’t bother to think  about it. Somewhere deep down inside of her, she had the feeling that  this was true of most of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  gritted her teeth, both figuratively and literally, and started off  for the cabin, where that one word awaited her.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Shiho  was on the ground, pressed up against a tree in the fetal position  about half a second before the shooting started.  She was there  because Minoru had told her to be there, and, because she had  absolutely no intention of following some stupid paranoid bastard’s  directions--<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">and why the hell did I go out into the forest alone  with him anyway he’s probably some pedophile we picked up by the  side of the road</span></em>—he had picked her up and plopped her there,  and then the shooting had started.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The only  reason he wasn’t already dead was that they weren’t shooting at  him yet.  They were shooting at the animals that were more afraid of  humans than humans were of them: The bears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Japanese brown bear was a fairly large creature; though nowhere near  as large as its Alaskan and Canadian cousins, its weight could still  top 500 pounds, and it could still rip the head off of a normal human  being, gun or no.  They weren’t dangerous creatures by nature—that  is, they didn’t actively seek to rip anything off of anybody  without provocation, usually involving their young. None of the men  up in the trees ever really figured out why it was that the bears  attacked them, and even if they had an inkling, they never would have  suspected that it had to do with something they couldn’t control:  Their scent.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  smelled, from their perches up in the trees, harnessed to the thick  trunks and buckled down to fire their big, 50 caliber sniper rifles,  a little bit like a baby brown bear. But to the bears down below,  they looked like big, angry people.  Natural assumption: They were  hiding the cubs under their shirts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In fact,  they were, to an extent. They all wore identical black undershirts,  so that they could identify themselves if need be.  All of these  black undershirts had been shipped to them in a box made of  unimpressive brown cardboard, and all of them had, for about fifteen  minutes, fallen into the hands of somebody who supposedly worked for  the man with the hoarse voice, but who nobody could ever quite match  a name to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All of  them smelled exactly like bear cub. So when, high above them, on the  very tops of the trees, Akira squeezed the bear cub just enough to  make it squeal—an adorable sound, really; like a stuffed animal—the  bears on the ground—usually unseen, foraging or sleeping—reacted  as any concerned parents would when they heard their missing child  shrill: They started ascending the trees, quickly, preparing to rip  the heads off of whoever it was that had their babies.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And the  arms, and the legs, and whatever else was necessary.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  bears <em>really </em>weren’t afraid of them. Minoru got the  impression that maybe the old saw was nothing but a myth, and a  malicious one, at that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  could assemble his rifle straight out of his backpack in less than  two minutes on his worst day in the field, but today was  significantly worse than his worst day on the field. He was stressed,  he was directly under enemy fire in the middle of what may as well  have been an open field, his hand still ached when he formed a fist,  and he had a little girl in his charge.  A crying little girl,  huddled up against a tree. He practically dumped the contents of the  pack onto the ground, but in a moment of clarity, reached out with  his bad hand and allowed the packet of pins to fall into his open  palm.  A tremor of pain shook his hand slightly as he caught it, but  he didn’t drop it, so he figured it was all right.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  should have gotten to cover first, jackass.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Now he  was sitting in what may as well have been an open field trying  desperately to assemble a rifle broken into four pieces that he  should probably clean before he fired.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not that  he had enough time for something like that.   He would have to rely  on Akira and her bunch—<em>don’t worry, buddy, we have </em>ninja <em>covering us</em>, would have been enough to make Minoru seek higher  ground and a spotter that wasn’t batshit insane—to keep them  alive.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  dropped to one knee and quickly counted the parts to his rifle. His  brain was still halfway in panic mode—the promise of ninja cover  did little to soothe that—so he didn’t quite have the acuity to  take stock of what he had, but his rifle only had four pieces.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And a  scope.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Where  the hell is your scope?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru’s  mind was a grassy field, and a powerful river called <em>panic </em>was  rapidly eroding it away.  Or maybe it was named <em>insanity.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You’d  have to be nuts to do this job anyway.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Say  your lesson</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">His  “lesson” was an old rhythmic phrase, the kind of thing you might  sing in a first grade classroom.  He didn’t remember who had taught  it to him, but it was calming. It focused his mind, the steady, dull  rhythm lulling his frantic mind gently into calmness, readiness.  He  grabbed the butt-piece of his gun, slid it between his legs, and with  his good hand, picked up the bolt-piece.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The <em>bolt </em>takes <em>stock </em>of the <em>butt </em>of the gun,  the <em>trigger </em>guarded still,” he said quietly, stressing the  iambs of the lesson as he quickly forced the bolt action, a long,  thin tube that housed the firing mechanism, into the rear half of the  weapon, and then connected the trigger mechanism and eased it into  the trigger guard.  “The <em>barrel </em>must go on quite straight,  now or you never will.” He slid the front half of the gun,  primarily the long, silenced barrel, onto the bolt, and then opened  his baggie full of pins into his bad hand.  Each one thudded onto his  hand like a needle, but he didn’t drop any of them, and a moment  later, he was reaching into his bag for a clip of ammunition, which  he slammed home without any caution at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He was  starting to get better, but a second too late; everybody around him,  all of the men and women positioned so obviously and unscrupulously  in the trees, either hung from their harnesses and dripped blood to  the ground, or lay on the ground, being devoured by the bears, to  whom Akira had returned the cub at some point.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiho  was also looking up, staring straight at the nearest corpse, some  poor bastard who had been half-eaten by a bear.  All that remained of  him now was his torso, still strapped grotesquely to the harness like  some unfortunate marionette who’d fallen victim to its puppeteer’s  drunken rages once too often.  His guts lay in a red, lumpy pile at  the foot of the tree, and there was a bear just beginning to sniff at  it delicately, deciding whether or not it was worth eating.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  knew what Shiho was going through.  It was the same thing he’d gone  through the first time he’d seen a dead man—a kind of morbid  revulsion, fed by a grotesque fascination with the corpse which  turned paler by the second, with its lifelessness.  She was staring  at it, wondering if it was going to move again. A lot of people had  trouble comprehending death at this level, young or not. He didn’t  blame her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But he  did know they needed to get moving. This was possibly the luckiest  day of his life—and everybody else’s unluckiest—but he didn’t  think for a second that anybody, even rookies like these had  obviously been, would let him sit around in the open, panicking and  trying to assemble his gun from scratch on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">His very  dirty gun. He wondered if he should chance cleaning it, or chance  firing it later, but he knew in an instant that it would be better to  move, <em>now, </em>while nobody could see him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  grabbed Shiho’s hand, and it seemed to jolt her out of her  trance-like state.  “Come on,” he grunted. “It’s not going to  move, and we have to go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  stared blankly, straight at him for a second, and he wondered what  was going through her head—was she startled that he had touched her  all of a sudden? He knew that junior high girls had freaked out and  cried <em>pervert! </em>for less than that.  Or was she not seeing him  at all? Was she still, in her mind, staring at that corpse, still  waiting for it to move? A lot of people had that problem, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  didn’t matter. If he didn’t move soon, she wouldn’t be staring  at anybody at all.  These, he knew without much thought, were  Scratch-ass’s people, and Scratch-ass had money.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  people with money were rarely to be denied, in his experience.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  squeezed Shiho’s hand, and said, “Come on.  You don’t want to  end up like them, take my word on that,” and then reached down with  his bad hand, slid his backpack around his wrist, and took off deeper  into the forest, looking for some kind of cover, some good rock  formation or group of downed trees that would provide him cover so  that he could use his blanket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  did his best to ignore the nagging question:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  then what?</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Shizuru  did not meditate.  She did not sleep in the vicinity of other people,  practice medieval shunning, or ponder the ways of the universe—at  least not with her eyes closed.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Therefore,  when Natsuki entered the cabin, quietly but quickly, allowing herself  to let the door slam shut only by telling herself forcefully that  stealth was <em>not </em>an issue but speed was, and heard no response,  no call of, <em>who is it? </em>or request for privacy, but only the  dull, giddy sound of friends talking, even gravely, she was  immediately nervous.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  slipped her shoes off at the door without thinking about it, but  grimaced as soon as she did—the cabin floors creaked, but worse  than that was the shuffling sound her socks made as she walked, even  on the balls of her feet (the best way to walk quietly, she’d  found) along the grainy wood.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  entryway was dark and a little humid, the light of the day having  escaped it as it retreated below the horizon but the heat still  holding out a little longer.  The wood on the walls seemed to jump  out at her a little more than usual—faces made from the lines in  the wooded boards seemed to call to her, or curse at her, or perhaps  even warn her of something much more sinister than they which waited  for her in the next room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  nodded at them as if to say, <em>I already know.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  door to the women’s room was shut, but there was a small light that  flickered and swung at chest height behind the paper door, and from  it, Natsuki could just barely make out a female form; seated but  still obviously fairly tall, slender, and curved exactly where it  needed to be.  Without wanting to, Natsuki found herself taking it  in, long hair to slender toe, several times. Each time, she felt  something deep down inside of her and low, swell and burn a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Is  this what hunger is like?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  form stood, and the light began to swing back and forth, so that at  one apex of each swing all shadow vanished and Natsuki stared, for  just a moment, at a sheet of paper instead of<br />
      <em>hunger</em><br />
  a woman.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Back and  forth. Back and forth.  The woman’s form seemed to travel along the  paper, following the swing of the light, until it vanished and then,  a second later, began to travel back towards Natsuki, a maiden torn  between her life and her lover.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Or  maybe a warrior torn between life and death.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Back  and forth. Back and forth.  Her slender body never moved except back  and forth, and Natsuki felt herself imagining those curves, carved  out of flesh rather than paper, and how they<br />
      <em>felt.<br />
        back  and</em><br />
  And  then, it wasn’t one form which traveled towards Natsuki, but two;  the maiden and her father, perhaps, vengeful and protective all at  once. Or maybe it was death, finally come for the warrior.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki’s  eyes widened and she almost cried out right there, but the smarter  half of her mind silenced her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Gun.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe  not <em>that </em>much smarter.  She reached for her side, where her  gun should have been, and found nothing<br />
      <em>forth</em><br />
  but the  cloth of her jeans. She cursed herself a fool and an ass.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Back  and…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  woman was alone in the room again.  Had Natsuki imagined that?  Imagined some huge masculine form behind her<br />
      <em>hunger</em><br />
  friend,  come to kill her like somebody was going to kill whoever was in the  forest?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  forest.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t have any more time to waste. She swallowed her pride,  mastered her shaking hands, and tried really really hard to  ignore her<br />
      <em>hunger</em><br />
  fear,  and then she reached out, trying not to see the faces in the walls,  all screaming at her, <em>no, don’t do it, find another way!</em> and  opened the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  noticed two things about the room immediately.  The first was  Shizuru.  She was<br />
      <em>beautiful<br />
        hunger</em><br />
  staring  straight at her in a queer mix of alarm and pleasure, and she was  naked. Her skin was<br />
  <em>as  smooth as i imagined</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">pale  and just slightly orange in the dim light of the lantern, and her  slender body was not in the slightest curved away from Natsuki as a  woman might naturally do if invaded in such a state.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  second thing she noticed was the man standing behind Shizuru.  He had  a knife, and he was also staring straight at Natsuki.  He didn’t  dare move.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  had not the slightest idea whether Shizuru knew of his presence.  She  also didn’t dare move.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  herself…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Perhaps  she simply didn’t dare move, for fear that all of this was a dream.  Perhaps she knew the man was behind her, and was paralyzed with fear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Either  way, for a minute, the room was the only place in Goza that night  that possessed any sort of peace.  The bombs which were beginning to  erupt in the city that night made sure of that.</span></p>
