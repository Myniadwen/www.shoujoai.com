<p>For an entire week  Natsuki had attended Miss Maria’s physical combat classes, serving  as an assistant of sorts to her former sensei while teaching the  young Corals a few of her own moves in the process. Well, teaching  the best that she could, anyway. Natsuki could only verbalize the  moves to her understudies since the metal cast on her arm wouldn’t  be removed for yet another week.</p>
<p>The classes themselves  only took up a few hours of her day, but Natsuki’s “free time”  consisted of near-relentless studying of the books that Oleander-sama  had given, and continued to give, her. However, she had found the time  one day to go into town and buy herself a new outfit to replace the  Vedelian uniform she had been sporting since she arrived. The young  woman had searched several shops before she made her decision,  finally resting on a pure white form-fitting tank top, a blue  half-jacket with white fur around its neck, the sleeves cuffed and  falling just above the elbow, a pair of black leather pants with  open slits on the outer thighs with a single silver ring residing in  the center of the open area, and a pair of dark brown knee-high  leather boots that she left hidden under her pants. Natsuki had also  chosen a simple black choker to finish off her outfit. Accessories  were always a plus, right?</p>
<p>Of course, when she got  back to the school, a certain teacher had immediately frowned at her  attire, stating that it was a “bad influence to the girls,” and  Natsuki had hastily apologized and sped away to her room as quickly  as her legs could carry her. Miss Maria would get used to it, right?  Besides, Natsuki would be taking over the class the following week,  so as long as the principle approved of it, everything would be  fine…hopefully.</p>
<p>The weekend came and  went in the blink of an eye, the only notable event being the  removing of the metal cast from Natsuki’s right arm by Doctor  Youko. To say that the raven-haired girl was relieved to be rid of  the damn thing would be an understatement. Even though it was gone,  however, Youko still wrapped the appendage in medical tape just to be  cautious. Other than being a little on the stiff and sore side, the  limb was perfectly moveable, as if the bone had never been shattered  in the first place, something that Natsuki was certainly pleased  about. She would have to thank Finias the next time she was in Vedel,  the girl noted to herself.</p>
<p>The classes with the  Corals went just about as smoothly as possible, although teaching was  sometimes difficult when Natsuki still wasn’t able to materialize  due to her lack of a GEM. Still, the young soldier persisted, and the  girls seemed to be having a good enough time anyway.</p>
<p>By the time she made it  to the end of the week, Natsuki was starting to get bored with the  same routine she had been following day-in-day-out. Miss Maria had  showed her the schedule the older woman always strictly followed like  it was a religion, but Natsuki finally gave in to her rebellious side  on the last day of class for the week.</p>
<p>“Alright, everyone  gather up,” the dark-haired woman announced to the class, and the  young Coral’s did so obediently although looking slightly perplexed  as they huddled together.</p>
<p>“What’s going on,  Natsuki Onee-sama?” Sara Gallagher, a prospecting Coral at the top  of her class, questioned, “Shouldn’t we be in roll call?”</p>
<p>“We’re going to try  something a little different today,” Natsuki stated, the crowd of  girls muttering amongst themselves upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>“…But, shouldn’t  we be running our usual laps around the track?” a voice from the  crowd asked, and there were several acknowledging mumblings that  followed it.</p>
<p>“Trust me, you’ll  get your running in for the day. We’re going to play a little game  of capture the flag today.”</p>
<p>That certainly seemed  to get a more positive response from the girls, many heads picking up  to listen to what was going to be said.</p>
<p>After explaining the  rules of the game and splitting the class into two teams,  identifiable by either a red or blue ribbon tied around the arm,  Natsuki sent the girls to their separate bases, which she had set up  earlier that morning, one on either side of the school. The young  Gakuenchou-in-training had been sure to emphasize to her students  that there was to be absolutely <em>no</em> fighting during the match,  but robes and flying were perfectly permissible. Rather than sit out  on the fun, Natsuki had tied a red ribbon around her own arm and  snuck off to her team’s base, receiving a very cheerful welcome  from the girls who were happy to see their Onee-sama on their side.</p>
<p>“Alright, we need to  designate a group for defense and a group for offensive, alright?”  Natsuki instructed her troops that were currently huddled  around her, “Saori-chan, you’ll lead the attacking group, okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” came the  curt reply from the brown-eyed Windbloom native.</p>
<p>“And…Eri-chan,  think you can handle defending the base?”</p>
<p>“Of course,  Onee-sama,” the tall girl answered in full confidence.</p>
<p>“Good. Now, let’s  split up and form the two groups. Let’s keep a few more here at the base  for defense right now. I’ll support the offensive group in this  first raid, if that’s okay with everyone.”</p>
<p>Needless to say, no one  objected, and once the group had been split once again, a ten-to-five ratio,  Natsuki gathered her squad around her.</p>
<p>“Alright, Saori-chan,  how do you think we should attack?”</p>
<p>The short girl placed  one hand on her hip, the other rubbing the tip of her nose as she  pondered on what tactic to enforce.</p>
<p>“I think two of us  should attack from the right, two from the left…” the dark-haired  Coral finally said before a sly smile crossed her face, “and  Onee-sama from straight on, to serve as bait.”</p>
<p>“Bait?!” Natsuki  exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Yep, and Onee-sama  can’t go against her commanding officer’s orders.”</p>
<p>“But—!“</p>
<p>“No complaints.”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am,” the  green-eyed woman finally gave in, hanging her head in pretend defeat  and causing the girls to giggle in the process.</p>
<p>“Now, everyone, move  out!” Saori yelled, swinging her arm in dramatic fashion before all  the girls, including herself, flew off in their predetermined  directions.</p>
<p>“Oi, I can’t fly  though!” Natsuki whined before taking off at a full sprint  towards the enemy camp.</p>
<p>Running across the  campus, Natsuki was sure to keep an eye not only on her teammates,  but also on the opposing group. She watched as some of them flew  overhead in the direction of her own base, desperately wishing she  could warn them of the oncoming strike, but keeping with her current  task instead.</p>
<p>When they had come  rather close to the enemy base, Saori lowered herself to the ground,  the other girls following her example. Natsuki soon joined them in  their hiding spot amongst some nearby shrubbery.</p>
<p>“Alright, Natsuki  Onee-sama, you go in first. Your mission is to retrieve the enemy  flag and pass it off to one of us, alright?”</p>
<p>“Right,” Natsuki  answered.</p>
<p>“Good luck,  Onee-sama,” Marie nodded to her sensei, and the remaining two did  the same.</p>
<p>Taking one last deep  breath, Natsuki snuck a bit closer to the encampment, the other girls  flying to either side of the giant tree where the flag currently resided,  making sure not to get too close and to stay low to the ground and  out of sight.</p>
<p>“<em>So there’s  three of them around the flag…two more on close patrol…”</em> the green eyed Vedelian thought to herself, <em>“Alright, here goes  nothing.”</em></p>
<p>Springing from the  bushes, Natsuki once again entered a full-out sprint.</p>
<p>“Natsuki Onee-sama!”  one of the blue team girls proclaimed, alerting the others of their  sensei’s presence, as she dove after her teacher.</p>
<p>Thinking quick on her  feet, Natsuki jumped, flying just under the impending tackle before  tucking and rolling a few feet further. Out of the corner of her eye,  Natsuki noticed that Saori had sent in two member of the offensive  squad to busy some of the other guards, and she was quite thankful  for the smart move of her young commander. Once back onto her feet,  the young woman managed to hurdle another girl, and pulling out a  spin move on another, successfully grabbed the blue flag.</p>
<p>“I’ve got it!”  she announced, and quickly turning on her heels, Natsuki began the  long trek back to her team base.</p>
<p>The muscles of her legs  stung from their constant use, but she pushed them further still.  With every breath of air her lungs felt as if they might burst, and  yet she still ran. Some of the blue team had taken notable dives at  her, but the more experienced soldier and Garderobe graduate managed  to avoid their every try.</p>
<p>Or at least she <em>did </em>avoid their every try  until she had reached the front of the academic building. There, she  saw something that made her screech to an immediate stop.</p>
<p>“Shizu—huah!”</p>
<p>Contact.</p>
<p>The moments pause had  lasted only a fraction of a second before Natsuki was piled upon by a  group of the young Coral’s with blue ribbons around their arms, and  now she was quite literally eating dirt…and it tasted just as bad  as she had ever imagined it would. Possibly worse.</p>
<p>“We got you,  Onee-sama!”</p>
<p>“Give us back the  flag!”</p>
<p>“You have to follow  the rules, Natsuki Onee-sama!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Natsuki-san. We  administrators wouldn’t want to teach our students foul play, now  would we?” came the sweet Kyoto-ben accent of the russet-eyed  Column.</p>
<p>Suddenly, all attention  from the game was turned upon the woman, and Natsuki was eventually  free from the numerous bodies that had effectively trapped her,  turning onto her back once she was able to.</p>
<p>“Shizuru Onee-sama!”</p>
<p>“Shizuru Onee-sama is  back!”</p>
<p>“How was your trip,  Onee-sama?”</p>
<p>“It’s good to see  you again!”</p>
<p>Despite all the gleeful commotion and the growing crowd, ruby met  viridian with a simple, happy smile.</p>

<strong>Chapter Notes:</strong>
<p>1. Long time no see,  eh? Sorry about that. I figured after such a long absence that a fun,  slightly extended chapter was due. Think of it as an apology for  taking so long.</p>
<p>2. Natsuki’s outfit  was designed off of Squall Leonhart's from Kingdom Hearts II, along  with me messing around in the character creation on Soul Calibur III.  It’s a little difficult to explain, so if you want to, you can  check out the rough sketch of what I kind of see it looking like (you  can find the link on my profile page). Sorry if it looks a little  funky. It was a quick sketch…and then I started messing with it in  Photoshop (lol). Anyway, the color scheme is<em> supposed</em> to be  similar to her outfit in Otome.</p>
