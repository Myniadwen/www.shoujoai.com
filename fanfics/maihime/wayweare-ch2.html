<p>Underneath the Surface</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I never knew that two  days could be so agonizingly long…So very, very long…
<p>Since that morning in  homeroom when I read the letter Shizuru had given me, I hadn’t been  able to get the whole situation out of my mind.</p>
<p>Why had she seemed  upset the day before? Was there something she wanted to tell me?<em>Needed</em> to tell me? Why couldn’t she just say it? Why does  she want to meet on a Saturday evening?</p>
<p>But more  importantly…why do I even care so much?</p>
<p><em>This is probably  just some big joke at my expense. </em></p>
<p>The taping of my pencil  on the table suddenly became more rapid and forceful.</p>
<p>“Arg!” I finally  roared, throwing the writing utencil across the room. It made a faint<em>‘tink’</em> as it hit the floor and continued rolling across  the apartment as I stared straight ahead.</p>
<p>I felt as though my  eyes could burn holes in the wall from the intensity of my frustrated  glare. Snapping my head, I looked over at the clock on the microwave,  its green numbers seeming to taunt me.</p>
<p><em>5:00 </em></p>
<p>It was an hour before  the proposed meeting time, and I still hadn’t decided on what to  do.</p>
<p>“<em>I thought you had  come to the decision to not trust anyone,” </em>my brain jabbed at  me in a mocking tone, “<em>I thought you didn’t want to get close  to anyone ever again. We know how much you dread the idea of losing  another person you hold so dear—“</em></p>
<p>“Shut up!” I  screamed, “Just…shut up…”</p>
<p>I placed a hand over my  face, and tried not to think of my mother and father.</p>
<p>I failed miserably.</p>
<p>Lying back on the floor  and forgetting about my homework for the time being, I blinked up at  the white ceiling, my arms sprawled out above my head.</p>
<p><em>What am I supposed  to do?</em></p>
<p>Turning my head to the  side, I closed my eyes. I stayed like this for what seemed like an  eternity, but when I mustered up the courage to peek at the clock  again, only twenty-three minutes had passed.</p>
<p>“Fresh air…that’s  what I need,” I stated out loud.</p>
<p>Sliding my feet out  from under the table, I pulled myself up off the ground with a small  grunt and headed to my bedroom. I slipped on a simple t-shirt over my  tank top, traded my pajama shorts for a pair of snug blue jeans, and  laced up my shoes before grabbing my keys and cell phone. Deciding to  just leave my hair in its messy ponytail, I headed out the door.</p>
<p>After grabbing a bite  to eat from one of the open food stands, I walked around the city  aimlessly for a while, not going anywhere in particular. I did some  mindless window-shopping as I finished eating my bean paste bread,  every now and then unconsciously flicking my cell open to see what  time it was.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I was  standing in front of Fuuka Academy.</p>
<p>It was 5:55.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I laid in my bed,  huddling under the warm sheets curled up in a ball and not wanting to  move an inch. My eyes caught a glimpse of the alarm clock residing on  the other side of the bed.
<p><em>1:10 </em></p>
<p>I’d been awake for  over an hour, and I still hadn’t got out of bed.</p>
<p><em>You’ve already  slept in…how long are you planning on staying in bed? All day?</em></p>
<p>I mentally shrugged.</p>
<p><em>Just because today  is…</em></p>
<p>I groaned as I rolled  over and nearly off the side of the bed in the process. Luckily I had  enough wits about me to stick my legs out and barely catch myself  before I face-planted directly onto the floor. I shuffled over to the  kitchen and got a kettle of water boiling on the stove before going  into the bathroom.</p>
<p>Flicking on the lights,  I squinted at my reflection in the mirror. I ran a hand through my  disheveled hair and straightened my bangs as best as I could before  allowing the yawn I’d been holding back to escape. At the sound of  a high-pitched whistling, I retreated back to the kitchen and make  myself a cup of hot tea. Once I was done adding some sugar and milk,  I walked over to the couch and flipped on the TV, changing over to  one of the news channels to see if anything had happened during the  night as I sipped at the hot substance in the cup.</p>
<p><em>Mmm…that’s  exactly what I needed.</em></p>
<p>The caffeine in the tea  helped wake me up, and once I’d finished off the liquid and placed  the mug into the sink, I returned to the bathroom and started the  water in the shower. I stripped down as I waited for it to warm up,  and once it reached a desirable temperature, I ventured inside. The  feel of the warm water raining down on my skin was relaxing, and I  took my time washing off.</p>
<p>The handle made a soft  squeaking noise as I turn it off. Sticking an arm out of the curtain,  I grabbed the nearest towel and started to dry myself. Once I had  finished, I wrapped the towel around my body, its soft white cloth  barely long enough to keep me covered up. After applying lotion to my  legs and arms, its sweet lavender scent taking over the room, I  exited the bathroom just in time to hear my cell ringing.</p>
<p>Hastily walking over to  my desk, I checked the caller ID on the external screen. It was my  mother. My <em>estranged</em> mother. I was honestly shocked to see  that she was calling…even if today was <em>that</em> day.</p>
<p>I didn’t answer.</p>
<p>It might sound cruel,  but you have to understand the circumstances with my family.</p>
<p>My father was one of  the wealthiest and well-trained businessmen in Kyoto, possibly in all  of Japan. He did a lot of traveling out of country, especially to  places in Western Europe. It was on one of these many business trips  that he met my mother. She was the owner of a private company in  France that happened to have some dealings with my father’s company  and apparently the two hit it off as soon as they met. A couple of  months later they were married, and not too long after, I came along.</p>
<p>I don’t really  remember us ever being a happy family. Both mom and dad were never at  the house, and I was practically raised by the housekeepers that kept  our Kyoto manor up and running. I was taught all the traditional arts  a prominent Japanese woman would have learned back in the earlier  days of Japan, and also a few others such as classical piano and  violin.</p>
<p>Oh, the life of the  wealthy…I wish I could of traded it for a normal one. One where I  could have actually spent time with my parents. I would have done it  in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>As for my childhood, I  never really felt like I ever had one. I was always off at one lesson  or another and practically had no time to just be the kid that I was.  However, on the rare occasions that both of my parents were home,  we’d all go out for a picnic in the fields that we owned around the  house and just relax and enjoy the time we had together. Sometimes  we’d even go horseback riding. It’s sad to think how few of times  we actually had like that.</p>
<p>Time flew by quickly,  and soon I was growing, hormonal teenager. In those last few years  leading up to my thirteenth birthday, dad actually spent a lot more  time at home. I was so happy to be able to spend time with him, and  the two of us were beginning to get rather close…</p>
<p>Then the accident  happened.</p>
<p>I don’t really know  the details of it all. I just know that he had been on a plane to  America when the engines apparently gave out and the small, personal  craft crashed into the ocean. The plane caught fire. They never found  his body.</p>
<p>After that my mother  and I slowly stopped communicating. She kept herself busy with work,  and I had school and lessons to attend. When she decided to move back  to France, I refused to go with her. Japan was my home, and although  I had learned French and could speak it well enough, I wasn’t about  to leave my place of birth. Despite this, she left anyway.</p>
<p>I later found out that  she remarried two years after dad died. The sad thing is, it was one  of the maids back in Kyoto who called me to tell me the news. Mom  didn’t even have the gumption to call me herself. I have no  intention of ever meeting my stepfather.</p>
<p>It was about six months  later that I transferred to Fuuka Academy after being awarded a full  scholarship. Staying in Kyoto, in the house where my dad and I had  spent those last few years together, was just too hard on me. I had  to get away, and with no one there to oppose me and no reason to  stay, I did just that.</p>
<p>And now here I stood in  one of the Fuuka Academy dorms. All alone. On the day of my father’s  death.</p>
<p>By now it was already  past three o’clock. After slipping into my bathrobe, I wasted  another hour surfing the Internet, and then spent an additional  thirty minutes drying and straightening my hair.</p>
<p><em>Almost 5:00…just  one more hour before…</em></p>
<p>I honestly don’t know  what possessed me to give Natuski that note telling her to meet me at  the garden. I had almost asked her that day we ate lunch together,  but I had stopped myself then. Later that night I struggled with the  idea, and in the end wrote that note at three in the morning. I had  then proceeded to slip it to her on the way to class the next morning  and had really not given it any more thought…at least not until  now.</p>
<p><em>I wonder if she’ll  come…Who am I kidding, this is Natsuki we’re talking about. She  doesn’t socialize with anyone. The only reason she’s actually  been talking to me a little is because we keep running into each  other and I practically force it out of her. She probably hates me  for tormenting her…but still…</em></p>
<p>I went over to my  closet and sifted through the clothing packed into the small space. I  tried on several different outfits, some casual, some dressy, before  settling on one slightly in between. I chose a knee length maroon  skirt along with a white camisole that had a floral design stitched  along the top, and a matching sweater, which I left unbuttoned. After  changing, I picked out a pair of dark brown boots that came up to the  middle of my calves to slip into. I also took out the sleek platinum  gold Rolex my father gave me for my 12th birthday and  slipped it onto my wrist.</p>
<p>This is the only day I  ever wear that watch. People at school would question me why I didn’t  wear it more often, but I never told them the truth, simply making up  some excuse about not wanting it to get messed up, or something  similar to it.</p>
<p>I peered down at the  ticking hands.</p>
<p><em>Twenty minutes…</em></p>
<p>Grabbing my purse, I  tossed my cell phone inside and fished out my keys. Deciding that I’d  probably lose my mind if I stayed here any longer, I went ahead and  left the dorm, being sure to lock the door behind me before I headed  for the Academy just down the road.</p>
<p>After arriving in the  gardens, I spent some time just gazing at the flowers. They looked so  beautiful in the light of the setting sun.</p>
<p>When it was about five  till six, I made my way to the fountain area. Once there, I  immediately walked over to the spot where I originally met Natsuki.  Reaching out, I gently touched one of the countless purple flowers on  the bush and smiled.</p>
<p><em>You were so angry  that day…I wonder if you’re like that all the time…</em></p>
<p>My reminiscing was cut  short when I heard footsteps coming from behind. I could feel my  heart begin to pound as I turned around to see the raven-haired girl  standing before me.</p>
<p><em>This is just the  reverse of the first time…how ironic.</em></p>
<p>“Natsuki…”</p>
<p><em>You’re a minute  early…I’m surprised.</em></p>
<p>She shyly looked away  from me, “Well, I’m here. What do you want?”</p>
<p>I chuckled softly at  the brashness of her words, “Do you mind if we talk for a bit?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” she  responded.</p>
<p>I watched as she sat  down on the fountain’s edge. Following suit, I took my place at her  side, setting my bag down at my feet.</p>
<p>We were close enough  that our shoulders were touching, and I noticed that Natsuki  stiffened at the initial contact, but she eventually relaxed again.  We sat in silence for a while, she staring down at the ground, me  straight ahead. Finally, I found the courage to start what I  originally brought us both here for.</p>
<p>“On this day…three  years ago…my father passed away.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“Oh…Were you  close?”</p>
<p>The question sounded a  little forced.</p>
<p>“We weren’t at  first, but towards the end, yes.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>More silence.</p>
<p>“So…what are you  doing here? Shouldn’t you, like, be with your family or something?”</p>
<p>“The only family I  have is my mother…and we haven’t exactly been on speaking terms  for a couple of years.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Silence again.</p>
<p>“Where…is he  buried?”</p>
<p>“His grave is back  home in Kyoto.”</p>
<p>“And you didn’t  want to be there?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t been  back home since I left,” I replied with a disheartened sigh.</p>
<p>Silence filled the air  yet again. I unintentionally leaned into Natsuki even more, but this  time she didn’t react to it at all.</p>
<p>“Can I ask you  something?”</p>
<p>Her voice startled me.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Why did you ask me  of all people to come here?”</p>
<p>That question must have  been nagging at her for the past couple of days considering the way  she said it, and I couldn’t control the sad smile that appeared on  my face as a result. It took me a minute to fully analyze the  question and conjure up an honest response. I at least owed her that  much. Unfortunately, it came out as one giant rambling.</p>
<p>“I know so many  people and yet…I don’t have even one person who I <em>truly</em> consider a friend. I’ve never even told anyone about this before.  About my father…my family…Everyone just sees me as this perfect  little class rep. with no troubles or worries…”</p>
<p>I paused momentarily to  try to collect the thoughts rapidly spewing out of my head.</p>
<p>“It’s always fallen  on a weekday where I could just keep my mind busy with school, but  when I saw that it was on a Saturday this year I…I knew I wouldn’t  be able to deal with it…I didn’t want to be alone, but I…didn’t  know who I could turn to…”</p>
<p>There was another  stretch of silence between us for a moment before the girl beside me  spoke.</p>
<p>“I…I’m not good  at this kind of stuff…” Natsuki stated as I felt her body shift.</p>
<p>Right when I thought  she was going to get up and leave, she settled again…and then she  said the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me.</p>
<p>“But…I’ll stay  here as long as you need me to.”</p>
<p>I tried to keep my  composure, but I had been hiding behind this mask of false  contentment for so long that I was too exhausted to try anymore. My  whole body began to tremble as the tears formed in my eyes. Before I  knew it, I was crying. Actually, crying doesn’t constitute for what  I was doing to be perfectly honest. I was sobbing. Uncontrollably. It  had been such a long time since I had allowed myself to cry…I  didn’t even let myself do so at father’s funeral, but I had never  in my life broken down in front of a fellow student.</p>
<p>Natsuki never looked at  me, rather, she simply kept her eyes focused on her hands. She  fiddled with them, but she was doing it so hard that it began to  leave red marks on her fingers. I guess that was just her way of  giving me my privacy as I wept. She was here for me, and that was all  that I needed. I don’t think she’s much of a touchy-feely type of  person, but I wasn’t looking for someone to comfort and hold me  like most people would have done. I just wanted someone to be there…I  wanted someone to listen to me…to understand.</p>
<p>After several minutes,  I finally regained control of my body and my emotions, and pulled out  my handkerchief to wipe off my face.</p>
<p>“Ara, sorry about  that,” I softly apologized.</p>
<p>The girl simply shook  her head, “Mmh.”</p>
<p>I flashed a small smile  at her response. I could tell she was uncomfortable with the whole  thing, but even so, she was still willing to sit here with me until I  was through. I silently thanked her for that.</p>
<p>I cleared my throat as  I stood, “I guess we don’t have to stay here any longer…It’s  starting to get chilly anyways.”</p>
<p>She rose as well, and  somewhere in the process, our eyes met.</p>
<p>Those sparkling emerald  orbs looking at me so gently seemed to ask if I really was done. They  were willing to stay longer, they said, if need be. I did my best to  reassuringly tell them that I would be fine.</p>
<p><em>Will I really?</em></p>
<p>The moment was over in  a blink of an eye, and tucking a strand of loose hair behind her ear,  Natsuki replied with a simple, “Alright.”</p>
<p>The two of us made our  way out of the garden; the only sound being the chirping of the  crickets and our feet against the stone walkway. I walked with my  hands clasped behind my back, purse in hand, Natsuki with hers shoved  in her jean pockets as we made simple conversation about school or  events in the news.</p>
<p><em>I’ve never really  just </em><em><strong>talked</strong></em><em> with you so easily like  this…it’s…normal, not the awkward way we usually are around  each other. This is…nice.</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t long before  we were standing outside of my dormitory, the large modern-styled  building looming over us.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Well, this is it,”  Shizuru said as she slowed to a stop in front of one of the Academy’s  large housing buildings.
<p>I turned my head up to  look at the thing, “Hmm.”</p>
<p>“Which one of the  dorms were you placed in?” she casually inquired.</p>
<p>“I’m not in any of  the school’s buildings.”</p>
<p>“You’re not?”</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>“Then where do you  live?”</p>
<p>“In one of the  apartment complexes in the city,” I replied with a nod of my head  in the direction of my current residence.</p>
<p>“Oh. I thought all  the students had to live in the dorms…How did you manage that?”</p>
<p>“Special  circumstances.”</p>
<p>Her face became  puzzled, curious more like it, “<em>Special circumstances</em>?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I plainly  remarked, obviously not wanting to go into further detail.</p>
<p>Luckily she got the  point, “Oh.”</p>
<p>I could plainly hear  the disappointment in her voice, but that was really not a path I  wanted to go down at this point in time. I didn’t want to burden  her with my own family problems, and I did’t want her feeling sorry  for me either. Besides, this night had already been distressing  enough as it was.</p>
<p>I saw her slender  figure shiver as the wind picked up, and Shizuru instinctively  wrapped her arms around herself.</p>
<p>Stretching slightly, I  shifted my body to a half turned position, “Well, I’ll be off so  you don’t have to freeze to death.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh…no,” she  mumbled with a shake of her head, allowing her arms to fall to her  sides once again, although the goose bumps on her skin were plainly  visible, “Do you…want to come up?”</p>
<p>Emerald met crimson  momentarily before I averted my gaze slightly, “Nah, I don’t want  to be in the way. Plus I have some homework I need to finish.”</p>
<p><em>Homework? On a  Saturday night?</em> <em>Ha, that was a lame excuse.</em></p>
<p>She looked at the  ground, not saying a word.</p>
<p>“Well, see you  arou—!“</p>
<p>I had begun to take my  first step back towards home when I felt a cold hand tightly wrap  around my wrist. It anchored me in place. It kind of hurt, too.</p>
<p>“Shizu—“</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>That’s all she said.  I turned to look at her, but her head was tilted down, thick bangs  covering her eyes.</p>
<p>I sighed as I roll my  own, “Fine.”</p>
<p><em>How come I always  give in to her?</em></p>
<p>Looking at her  distraught expression, however, another thought passed my mind. How<em>could</em> I leave her at a time like this? She was broken,  shattered…She needed someone there with her to help pick up the  pieces, and right now, I was the only one who could do that.</p>
<p>To actually be needed  by someone else…it was a strange and foreign feeling to say the  least. I had always relied on my parents in the past, and now that  they were gone, I only had myself to rely on. But no one had ever  needed <em>me</em>. What could I do? I really didn’t think that I  could be of any help to anyone, but I had gone through the loss of a  parent as well, had I not? Looking at Shizuru in the current state  she was in, so depressed and unlike herself, I knew I couldn’t just  run away like I always did. I couldn’t just abandon her…I  wouldn’t do what my father had done to me.</p>
<p>She slowly removed her  hand from my arm and began walking towards the building. Once inside,  I followed her up the stairs a few paces behind, inspecting the  brilliant red marks left behind on my pale skin by her fingers. I  rubbed the place and turned my attention to the door we were now  standing in front of.</p>
<p><em>Room 208. </em></p>
<p>I instantly committed  the number to memory.</p>
<p>Shizuru fiddled with  her keys for a moment before unlocking the door, and once inside, we  both slipped out of our shoes.</p>
<p>“Make yourself at  home.”</p>
<p>Slightly distracted by  the still heartbreaking tone that she’s trying so hard to cover up,  I followed her orders and trudged on inside. Her place was clean and  tidy, just as expected.</p>
<p><em>She’d have a heart  attack if she saw my living arrangements...</em></p>
<p>“Just sit wherever  you’d like,” the Kyoto accent broke through my thoughts, my eyes  following her as she took off her sweater and threw it onto one of  the beds, “Would you like some tea or something else to drink?”</p>
<p>“Uh, sure, tea’s  fine,” I replied, watching as she crossed in front of me towards  the small kitchen area, and in the meantime, I took in my current  surroundings.</p>
<p>There were two  twin-sized beds opposite of the door. To the left of them was a desk  area with two chairs, one sitting at each of the separate sections.  One side of the desk had been set up with a laptop and printer while  the other was being used for a mock entertainment center. An  expensive looking flat screen television sat on the main desk while a  DVD/ VCR player rested beside it. Across from the desks were a small  floor table and a couch with its back against the wall. Next to the  desks was a door leading to, what I assume to be, the bathroom, and  running along the entire left wall of the dorm was the kitchen where  the owner was currently busy preparing a hot beverage for the two of  us.</p>
<p>I walked over to the  couch, but rather than sitting on it, I sat in front of it. Leaning  back, I rested my head on it’s soft cushioning.</p>
<p>The two of us remained  silent for a time before I finally spoke, “This place is kind of  small…I’d hate to have to share it with someone else.”</p>
<p>“Agreed,” the quiet  voice chirped back at me.</p>
<p>“You don’t have a  roommate?” I questioned as Shizuru continued preparing the tea.</p>
<p>“Nope. I pay extra so  I can have the room to myself.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” I stated as  she turned and walked towards me with two steaming mugs in her hands,  “I guess it wouldn’t be too bad then.”</p>
<p>Shizuru placed one of  the mugs on the table before she circled around it and sat on the  couch.</p>
<p>“You’re funny.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” I murmured  before taking a sip of my tea.</p>
<p><em>Still too hot.</em></p>
<p>“Why did you sit on  the floor when the couch was right here?”</p>
<p>“Oh…I dunno.”</p>
<p>She chuckled at me, and  I couldn’t stop a smile from tugging at the corners of my lips  despite the familiar pink finding its way to my cheeks.</p>
<p>“Can you hand me the  remote?” she questioned as she placed her mug down on the table.</p>
<p>I grabbed the item,  which was right in front of me, and passed it to her over my  shoulder. Soon the screen before us came to life.</p>
<p>Flipping through some  of the channels, I heard Shizuru let out a sigh, “Anything you want  to watch?”</p>
<p>I shook my head, “Not  particularly. I don’t watch much television.”</p>
<p>“Me either,” she  responded as she continued to click through channel after channel,  “What about a movie?”</p>
<p>“I don’t care,” I  honestly replied, “What do you have?”</p>
<p>“Mmm,” she grumbled  as she got off the couch, walked over to the desks, and crouched down  while sliding one of the drawers open. Too lazy to actually get up, I  crawled over to her to look into the drawer myself.</p>
<p><em>Chick flick,  romantic comedy, chick flick, chick flick, depressing drama…aha!</em></p>
<p>I was lucky to find an  action movie and immediately pointed it out to her, “What about  this one?”</p>
<p>She looked at me  suspiciously, and I could tell she was on to me when a sly little  smile appeared on her face.</p>
<p>“Natsuki wants to  watch…this one?” she inquired as she purposely pulled out what  appeared to be the girliest of the girly movies. Immediately, I faked  like I was choking and dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>“A-ra!” Shizuru  exclaimed in an overly dramatic tone, obviously playing along,  “Natsuki is not breathing…I guess I shall have to resuscitate her  with <em>mouth to mouth…</em>”</p>
<p>My eyes snapped open,  but before I could do anything, the girl had moved on top of me, her  hands planted on either side of me, and her face hovering right above  my own.</p>
<p>“N-no! Stop!” I  cried out, my face immediately turning red as I tried to turn away  from her.</p>
<p><em>Wha-What is she  doing?!</em></p>
<p>“Mou…Natsuki is so  mean…” Shizuru teased me with a pout, daring to lean in closer. I  swallowed hard as I stared into her crimson eyes that are now mere  inches away.</p>
<p>My pulse quickened.</p>
<p>Suddenly the chestnut  haired girl burst into a fit of laughter, falling across my body as  she was unable to hold herself up because of it. She rolled over so  that her head was resting on my stomach as she covered her mouth in  an attempt to make herself cease her childish giggling. I sat there  blinking for a moment, unsure of what exactly had just taken place.</p>
<p>“H-hey! That wasn’t  funny!” I tried to defiantly protest in an attempt to maintain <em>some</em> of my dignity, but I soon found myself laughing as well, “Feeling  better?”</p>
<p>She lifted herself off  of me as she nodded, “Mmh, thanks to you. And as a reward…”</p>
<p>Propping myself up on  my elbows, I watched as she returned the chick flick to its proper  place in the drawer and pulled out the movie I had suggested earlier,  “We can watch your <em>real</em> choice.”</p>
<p>After putting the movie  into the player and turning out the lights, we took our seats from  earlier: Shizuru reclining on the sofa and me leaning my back against  it. We skipped all the previews and went straight to playing the  actual movie, which turned out to be one of those action thrillers  where the main character ends up having to save the girl he loves  from his archenemy. So cliché, but it wasn’t all that bad.</p>
<p>Throughout the  beginning of the movie, we made comments every now and then about  what was going on. At one point I could feel Shizuru playing with my  hair, but I just ignored it for the time being and let her be.</p>
<p>Eventually the credits  began to roll, and I stretched out from my position on the floor, “I  totally saw that coming, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>When there was no  response, I turned to look over my shoulder and noticed that Shizuru  had dozed off, her chest slowly rising and falling in quiet, rhythmic  breaths. I couldn’t hold back a smile seeing her like this, and  carefully got up to turn off the TV and go find a blanket. I took one  from the closet and carefully laid it over her, freezing as she  shifted a little from the contact, but thankfully she remained  asleep.</p>
<p>I made my way over to  one of the desk chairs opposite the couch and straddled it. Crossing  my arms over it’s back, I rested my chin atop them and simply  watched her resting there.</p>
<p>I don’t know how long  I was sitting in that silent room with her sleeping form, but I think  it was then and there that I decided that maybe having <em>one</em> friend might not be that bad.</p>
<p>Looking over at the  clock, I let out a quiet sigh.</p>
<p><em>It’s almost 12:00.  I guess I’d better head home.</em></p>
<p>After some snooping  around at Shizuru’s desk, I managed to find a pad of paper and a  pencil.</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Sorry,  had to bolt. Got some stuff to take care of early tomorrow morning.</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>449-0263  Call if you need anything.</em></strong></p>
<p>After I had scribbled  out the little note in my messy handwriting and accompanied it with a  quick little chibi sketch of a snoring Shizuru, I propped it up  against one of the mugs on the table and headed for the door. I  pulled on my shoes, and after taking one last glance over at the girl  on the couch, I quietly slipped out the door.</p>

<strong>AN: </strong> Just to  clear things up if they were a bit confusing, which they probably  were, Shizuru was 13 when her father died. She transferred to Fuuka  before the start of the next school year and now three years have  passed making her 16. Of course, this information and the details of  her past and family are all just made up by me. Hopefully they are  believable enough though.
<p>As far as the dorm  layout goes, I pretty much just based it off of Mai’s from the  series, but since it is Shizuru’s there are more expensive/fancy  electronics. Stupid rich kids…j/k.</p>
