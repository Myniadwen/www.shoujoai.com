<p>“<em>The class. I have  to wrap up the class first…”</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, Natsuki  thought, priorities really sucked.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it  gave her time to think out just what she was going to say to Shizuru  now that she was back from her trip to Romulus.</p>
<p>The last time they were  together…well…Natsuki had kissed the older woman, and right after  it happened she didn’t have a chance to explain herself because,  one, she was far too embarrassed about her sudden action, and two,  Shizuru had abruptly left. Even if she had had the chance to speak,  the girl didn’t know what she would have said. Emotions were a  complicated thing for the young Vedelian, just like anyone else, but  she often had the issue of not being able to properly verbalize what  she was feeling or thinking either.</p>
<p>She loved Shizuru…but  what exactly did that love entail? Natsuki looked up to the woman as  an Otome, she considered the russet-eyed woman a friend, most  definitely, but simple admirers or friends didn’t kiss each  other…not in <em>that</em> way.</p>
<p>Just what was it about  Shizuru that made her feel that way? It was undeniable that she was  beautiful, anyone could see that, and Natsuki was no different. But  it was more than that. There was something about being around the  older woman that made her stomach tingle. She always found herself  wanting to please the woman, whether it be rising to the top of her  class, or simply not being able to deny the pouting face she knew was  a fake nine times out of ten. She wanted her attention, and as selfish as it might sound,  she felt slightly jealous whenever Shizuru flirted or talked to any  of the other girls, not to mention how quickly agitated she would  become when anyone else spoke to the chestnut-haired woman. And when  they’d get that look in their eye—</p>
<p>Natsuki shook her head,  trying to dislodge the thought from her mind, “God, why am I being  so possessive?”</p>
<p>“Did you say  something, Natsuki Onee-sama?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Looking down, Natsuki  finally noticed the blonde girl walking beside her.</p>
<p>“O-Oh, Sara. No, it’s  nothing.”</p>
<p>The young Coral pushed  at her glasses with a single finger, an unconvinced look upon her  face, “Mmh, I’m pretty sure you did—“</p>
<p>“How about,”  Natsuki interrupted, “you help me round up the rest of the girls so  we can end class early today?”</p>
<p>Although the girl  squinted at her momentarily, the enticement of not having class must  have won out in her mind as Sara nodded and took off to find her  classmates.</p>
<p>Returning to her  solitude, Natsuki resumed her pondering.</p>
<p>If she knew her true  feelings about the other woman, how come she couldn’t just come out  and tell her? Was it that difficult? Was the kiss an attempt to do  such a thing?</p>
<p>Rubbing the back of her  neck, the raven-haired Vedelian sighed.</p>
<p>Of course, this was all  only her side of the situation. She had no idea what Shizuru thought  of it all. She wasn’t even sure<em> how</em> Shizuru felt towards her to  be perfectly honest. Were they friends? Were they more than that? If  they were something more, just how serious was it?</p>
<p>There were too many  uncertainties floating up in the air, uncertainties that needed to be  grounded sooner than later, less the young girl go insane from her  mental unrest.</p>
<p>“<em>Now that she’s  back, we need to talk about it…about US…but how do you start a  conversation like that?”</em></p>
<p>The girl’s thoughts  were suddenly torn from her when the Gakuenchou entered her vision.</p>
<p>“Ah, Natsuki, I was  looking for you” Lucretia began, “Shizuru just returned from  Romulus.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Oleander-san. I  saw her walking by earlier.”</p>
<p>“I see, well, I just  thought you might like to know.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” the  girl replied with a slight bow of her head.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the  principle’s visage became curious, “…Aren’t you supposed to  be teaching a class right now, Miss Kruger?”</p>
<p>“A-Ah, y-yes ma’am.  I was just trying to round up the girls right now actually—“</p>
<p>“Oh?” the older  woman questioned, hands finding their way to her hips, “’<em>Round  up</em>?’ Did you <em>lose</em> them somehow?”</p>
<p>“N-No ma’am,” the  emerald eyed girl stuttered, “We were just, uh—“</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“We were just  playing…a little game…”</p>
<p>“A game?”</p>
<p>“…of capture the  flag…”</p>
<p>Natsuki heard the older  woman huff, and she grimaced at the sound before soft chuckling  reached her ears. Shocked, she set her eyes upon the  Gakuenchou’s face once more.</p>
<p>“I’m glad to see  you’re having fun with the girls, Natsuki,” the woman stated with  a smile before looking around a little cautiously and leaning in to  whisper to the girl, “that Miss Maria is a bit of a stickler, isn’t  she?”</p>
<p>The distinct harrumph  they had both come to know over the years radiated from behind them,  and apprehensively, both women turned around to see who they knew  would be standing there.</p>
<p>A  scowling-more-than-usual Miss Maria.</p>
<p>“Gakuenchou,” the  green-eyed elder practically barked, “there is business to attend  to in the meeting hall.”</p>
<p>“Ah-ha, yes, yes.  Well,” Lucretia sputtered somewhat nervously, “keeping working  hard, Natsuki.”</p>
<p>“Y-You as well,  Oleander-sama.”</p>
<p>At that, the two older  women proceeded on their way, and Natsuki couldn’t help but look  over her shoulder at their retreating backs.</p>
<p>“<em>More like ‘good  luck’…maybe Miss Maria won’t bite her head off…” </em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Once she was finished  with her class, Natsuki immediately set out to seek down the chestnut  haired woman she had wanted to talk to for quite some time.
<p>“<em>I wonder where  she is right now,”</em> the girl thought to herself as she walked  down the empty corridor of the Academy, <em>“Whenever Shizuru’s  here, she usually stays in the guest room, right?”</em></p>
<p>Quickly heading in that  direction, it only took the Vedelian a few minutes to reach the door,  and once she did, she quietly knocked on the sturdy structure. After receiving  only silence as a reply, Natsuki tried knocking a little harder.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shizuru, it’s  me. Are you in there?”</p>
<p>Still not hearing  anything, Natsuki grabbed the golden handle of the door, and turning  the device, slowly pushed the oaken door open.</p>
<p>“Shizuru…?”</p>
<p>It was only after  letting herself all the way in that the raven-haired girl’s ears  finally picked up on the sound water sputtering against the ground a  few feet away behind another closed door.</p>
<p>“<em>Shower. Makes  sense since she just got back,”</em> Natsuki thought to herself,  before wandering over to the nearby couch and promptly plopping down  on the soft cushioning.</p>
<p>With a long stretch,  the girl splayed her arms across the back of the couch, leaning her  head back as she slouched down slightly into a more comfortable  position.</p>
<p>“<em>Maybe she won’t  mind me waiting in here…” </em>she mentally stated as her eyes  lazily drifted shut.</p>
<p>“<em>And should she  come out undressed…</em>” the voice in the back of her mind  mentioned, and instantly the girl’s eyes snapped back open as her cheeks  colored vibrantly at the image that accompanied the thought.</p>
<p>“Maybe this wasn’t  such a good idea…” she muttered to herself as she stood.</p>
<p>She had only just begun  her retreat when she heard the door at her back creak open, freezing  her where she stood.</p>
<p>“Ara,” came the  surprised exclamation from Shizuru, “Natsuki, what are you doing  here?”</p>
<p>“I-I just came  looking for you, b-but you were in the shower, so I’ll just come  back by later—“</p>
<p>“Nonsense, it will  only take me a minute to dress, so please…” the woman trailed  off, her implication quite clear.</p>
<p>“A-Alright,”  Natsuki breathed, before cautiously peering back over her shoulder.</p>
<p>She watched as the  towel-clad woman crouched down to rummage through her baggage for  something to put on, snapping her head back around once it appeared  like she had found what she was looking for.</p>
<p>“I’ll be back in a  moment,” Shizuru announced, and once Natsuki heard the door close  behind her, she released the breath she had been holding and made her  way back over to the couch.</p>
<p>It was only a minute or  so later that Shizuru reemerged, now adorned in her usual pale violet Meister dress.</p>
<p>“Sorry for making you  wait.”</p>
<p>“Nnh,” the  viridian-eyed girl noised as she watched her friend cross the room  and take a seat beside her, “So how was the trip?”</p>
<p>“Boring. Politics are  not exactly the most interesting subject, in my opinion. How were  things here?”</p>
<p>“The usual, I guess.  There’s always something to keep you busy.”</p>
<p>“I see that Natsuki  finally got around to buying some clothes—”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“—and your cast is  gone as well,” Shizuru continued, taking the mended limb in her  hands, “When was it taken off?”</p>
<p>“A few days ago.”</p>
<p>“And it’s feeling  alright?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, the tape’s  just a precaution.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>With the natural pause  in the conversation, Natsuki sighed and drew back her arm, both hands  gripping her knees somewhat nervously.</p>
<p>“Um…Shizuru?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“About what  happened…before you left…”</p>
<p>“The kiss, you mean,”  Shizuru specified, and Natsuki’s cheeks flushed involuntarily  causing the woman beside her to chuckle lightly, “What about it?”</p>
<p>“If what I did caught  you off guard…o-or if I crossed my boundaries—“</p>
<p>A single thin brow rose  on the Column's face, “What <em>boundaries</em> do you speak of?”</p>
<p>“I-I dunno…”</p>
<p>A small smile formed on  the Graceful Amethyst’s lips, “I have to admit that I was a  little surprised at Natsuki’s sudden action…it’s not in your  character…”</p>
<p>“I—“</p>
<p>A single slender finger  cut off the girls words as it pressed against her slightly chapped  lips, “I wouldn’t mind getting used to such things though.”</p>
<p>Before the girl could  process a response, the woman beside her leaned in closer, her hand  adjusting to cup the right side of Natsuki’s jaw. The Vedelian’s  sharp green eyes focused on those pink-hued lips that were slowly  creeping closer to her own before they traveled up to meet stunning  ruby orbs that were staring back at her.</p>
<p>Again the women’s  lips met, the familiar taste consuming Natsuki’s senses as she  allowed her eyes to drift closed on their own accord. This time,  perhaps since Shizuru was the one in control or maybe because it  wasn’t the first time, the kiss seemed more practiced, but no less  passionate.</p>
<p>Eventually breaking  apart, Shizuru was the first to speak.</p>
<p>“You’ll have to  forgive me, Natsuki.”</p>
<p>“Forgive you?” the  girl echoed, worry entering her tone as her brow creased in  confusion.</p>
<p>“There’s a meeting  I must be off to for now. We can talk more later, okay?”</p>
<p>Natsuki breathed a sigh  of relief as a smirk etched its way into her features, “Work as a  Column never ceases, huh?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem  like it, does it?” the chestnut-haired woman replied lightheartedly  as she stood and made for the door, pausing in it’s opening, “You  will meet me later though, won’t you?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” came  the quick, honest reply.</p>
<p>“I’ll be sure to  come by your room once I’m done then.”</p>
<p>With that, Shizuru  disappeared from the doorway, leaving Natsuki to herself on the couch  as she lightly ran a finger over her bottom lip, a smile tugging at  the corners of her mouth as a spark of hope and confidence ignited in the depths of  her emerald eyes.</p>
<p>“<em>Maybe…maybe she  does feel the same…”</em></p>
