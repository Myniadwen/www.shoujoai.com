<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s  mine / it’s pure and / as decent as I can make myself / inside / we  all know</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Only the  strong survive #1</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sometimes  it only took a little nudge to bring Mai out of one of her spasms.  Sometimes it took just a hug from Mikoto, a grin from Yuuichi, a good  meal or a song played on the radio.  And then, sometimes…sometimes  it took a big fat fucking shove.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  supposed that she had recovered quickly enough from her most recent  one that it could be placed in the former category.  She also  supposed, as the storefront window of the scandalous little clothing  shop exploded outward and Chie and Aoi dived to the ground, that as a  nudge in the right direction, this was some big fucking overkill.  If  there was any trace of bitterness or depression in her system, it  evaporated along with about seven townies standing outside of the  storefront window at the time of the explosion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">(Chie  and Aoi would later become the official Sole Survivors of an event  that would never be named, but would be remembered by the town’s  inhabitants for centuries to come regardless.  More than a little bit  of bitterness would emerge from the townies on account of the fact  that it was tourists that survived, while many of their friends and  family were practically vaporized in the explosion, on top of that;  but Mai’s vacation ended long before the time that was necessary  for such bitterness to fester could pass).</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  chanced a single glance at Mikoto, whose face was remarkably  impassive considering she had just witnessed the deaths of seven-odd  people, and considering that Mai had a feeling that if she looked  carefully, she could probably spot pieces of about a dozen more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  chose not to look carefully, but she did dash towards Chie and Aoi;  the latter was just now picking herself up, but the former was  already up and walking; Mai saw blood running down the back of her  legs from what she could only assume were cuts on the front, and the  back of her shirt was pretty well burned off, leaving a pretty  ripe-looking burn in its place, but aside from that, she was unhurt.  Physically, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  noticed that as she approached, Chie gave no indication of perceiving  her presence, even as Mai shouted out their names frantically.  Mikoto came trotting up behind them a few seconds later, just as Aoi  managed to get to her feet, still in a daze.  She hadn’t yet caught  up with the present, but she would in a moment.  She hadn’t even  registered that she was falling out, in a big way, of her skimpy  little swimsuit that she must have been trying on.  The swimsuit had  a huge fray at the right shoulder, as well, probably from falling  over, Mai gauged.  It would snap soon.  Again, Aoi took no notice.  She latched her hand onto her forehead, groaning.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mai?”  she frowned. “What are you doing here?  What hap—” she looked  over her shoulder and her sentence simply fell away.  “Oh, god.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  bodies of the dead were little more than burned husks, except for one  piece of them: The explosion, which hadn’t dropped below shin  level, thanks to some solid construction on the foundation, had left  the husks’ feet and ankles intact.  Completely intact.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  made the burned corpses undeniably human.  Their feet; their  name-brand sneakers, their trendy heels, their painted toenails—one  of the feet was so freshly un-painted that there was actually a small  flame eating at the shiny, flesh-colored toenail—they belonged to <em>people</em>, not vaguely-human objects.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  Chie couldn’t take her eyes off of them.  Mai wanted to go to her,  but in the next instant, Aoi was latched onto her like a vice or a  certain persistent cold.  She wasn’t screaming, for which Mai  thanked whatever god happened to be listening (however privately  certain she was that whichever deities typically paid attention to  the earth were all sitting on the pot about now, or watching porn, or  whatever it was that a god did when it couldn’t bear to look  anymore), though the girl was making small noises between her teeth.  It sounded vaguely like a frightened dog learning to whistle, Mai  thought in some sadistic niche in the back of her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Son  of a bitch; somebody needs to move Chie before she loses it. </em>Mai  felt tears rising to her own eyes, which she kept focused firmly <em>away</em> from the bodies.  People were starting to gather around now, and none  of them made any sort of motion to help Chie.  Nobody recognized her;  just another out-of-towner, the fewer the better. She came here to  stare anyway, right? Let her stare. Mai, being from something of a  small town herself, recognized this mentality immediately, but she  couldn’t sympathize with it, not at all; this recognition had, in  fact, an inverse affect on her: Before long, she felt that familiar  little niggle of hatred, of pure, focused rage creep into her eyes  from the back of her mind.  Familiar from before.  From<br />
      <em>mikoto  dear god how could you my god im going to fucking</em><br />
  …from  before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mai?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  wanted to turn, but the weight around her shoulders wouldn’t let  her. <em>Yuuichi.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ma…shit,  Mai! What the hell is—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Forget  about me,” Mai shouted, though she desperately, desperately did not  want to.  All at once she wanted nothing more than to <em>be </em>comforted  rather than to comfort, to be held rather than hold.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Is  this what you’ve been reduced to, Mai? </em>something in the back of  her head mused. <em>Just a pathetic little lost cat? Is that all?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>…no. </em>“Forget about me, Yuuichi, get Chie! Get her away from here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  barely a second after the words left her mouth that Yuuichi passed  her at a full-out sprint; like he’d been ready to rescue Chie as  soon as he saw the devastation unfold in front of him, and that he  was just waiting on her permission.  Mai heard Shiho sigh a little as  Yuuichi left her. <em>Too fucking bad, bitch, </em>Mai thought  angrily, suddenly possessed with the overwhelming urge to slug the  girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Brave  Private Yuuichi once again threw himself in on top of the proverbial  grenade as he ran to Chie; in front of her, replacing her view of  seven-odd burned corpses with manicured toenails with a view of his  chest.  This, at least, was his intent; Yuuichi was assuming that as  she was really seeing, as she stared so intently, anything in the  present at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come  on, Chie,” he said quietly, putting his hand on her shoulder about  as gently as Mai had ever seen.  “Let’s get you out of here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t move; it was like her feet had been soldered to the ground  when she turned her back.  There was no kind of fear in her eyes;  none of the horror or regret or revulsion that some of the other  townies were experiencing.  Her eyes were at about half-mast,  completely neutral. <em>Right now, we may as well be on Mars; she’s  not seeing anything that’s happening here, </em>Yuuichi thought.  Mai saw him tighten his grip on Chie’s shoulder, putting a little  bit of force on it, trying to lead her as he</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>led  me<br />
  yuuichi  is so kind</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">might  lead a timid puppy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At that  point, Mikoto snapped out of whatever trance had been keeping her  ensnared, and without any sort of pretense, she…tip-toeing was  nearest thing to it, but she wasn’t trying to be quiet…went up to  Chie from behind, tugged on the back of her shirt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come  on,” she said quietly, and suddenly all eyes—all of them, even  those of the Townies—were on her.  “They’re dead now.  There’s  nothing that you can do.”  There was a dead hush, as though she’d  just declared something completely obscene. Maybe she had, and a  moment later anger began pouring off of the locals in waves that  could kill a man if he wasn’t careful.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then she  walked back to Mai, her own eyes towards the ground.  She had  certainly lost her spunk all at once, though she wasn’t nearly  as…shocked, for lack of a better word…as everybody else seemed to  be.  “Let’s go, Mai,” she said quietly. “I’m hungry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai knew  Mikoto very well.  She knew her, quite possibly, better than any  human being still alive at that moment, but she couldn’t…she  couldn’t quite place that look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No,  you know exactly where you’ve seen that look before.  That innocent  little lost puppy look that she gets on her…when she’s done</em><br />
  takumi  evaporates in a cloud of neon green<br />
  yuuichis  lips arent soft theyre gone<br />
  <em>something  awful.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mikoto, </em>Mai thought in a sudden, gut-wrenching moment, <em>did you—</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mikoto  looked into Mai’s eyes somberly, and Mai could have slapped herself  if she didn’t have a one hundred and twenty pound bag of trauma  strapped to her chest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mikoto  was feeling the exact same thing she was. Horror, but more than that,  sadness.  For everybody present.  Mai’s throat tightened, and she  mouthed, “I’m sorry,” at Mikoto, who only nodded a little and  started walking the other way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  could be said that this moment was truly the point in which the town  turned against their group: Chie began to respond to Yuuichi’s  movements, just enough that where he guided, she went; Mai whispered  to Aoi, “we have to go now,” and the girl detached herself from  Mai, seeming to have recovered herself fairly well. She whispered, <em>thank you</em> to Mai, who nodded with a smile and then went to  Chie, took her hand, finally nodding to Yuuichi, who caught up to  Mai.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They all  walked away from the place where more than twenty people died,  horribly. Nobody could claim that it was their doing; they didn’t  even know what happened.  But the sight of the six of them just  walking away from something that <em>they, </em>and <em>only </em>they of  all people had survived, pushed the townsfolk beyond the point of  caring about things like “fault.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But the  six of them didn’t know that.  They just started walking away, back  towards where the van was supposed to be. If they had cared to listen  closely—which they didn’t—maybe they would have heard the first  few muffled <em>phunks </em>of a silenced sniper rifle being fired into  the roof of a house.  Maybe they would have even known what to make  out of it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But they  didn’t.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Natsuki,  Akira, Reito, and Midori could only gape as they blazed down the main  drag towards the poorer part of town, to a location provided by one  Akira Okuzaki. She, it seemed, had all the answers at that point, but  when questioned about them, she merely shrugged and turned back  towards the window to gaze at the road blazing by at a speed so high,  it should have been illegal.  (And was.)  Somewhere behind them,  sirens were beginning to blaze towards them, but they knew the sirens  weren’t concerned with a van doing fifty over the speed limit in  the least.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  murmured, “My God,” gaping at the bodies with a kind of morbidly  fascinated revulsion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  turned her head away.  She had no urge to see any more death than  what she’d already seen in her lifetime; there was more of it in  her memory than most people would have guessed looking at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akira  watched the townsfolk, paying attention to how they observed the  death around them, how they dealt with it. Who looked passive and who  looked frightened. Two of them; both large men in golf sweatshirts,  looked remarkably impassive about the scene in front of them.  She  locked their faces into her mind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  jammed on the brake, hard and sudden enough that were the van not  equipped with anti-lock brakes, they would have probably skidded into  the strip-mall’s storefront.  As it was, all of the passengers of  the van except Akira went flying forward until their seatbelts locked  up around their chests and necks.  Midori and Reito gave a noise that  was fairly analogous to a pair of twins being strangled; before they  could protest, though, Natsuki looked at the two of them intently.  “Get out of the van.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”  Midori sputtered, rubbing her neck.  “Why?” In truth, she  protested more because she didn’t want to go out there than because  she didn’t want to stay in the van.  At that moment, she wasn’t  entirely sure where she wanted to be.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  everybody’s out there, and I think they’re in trouble.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akira  nodded.  “The way the townsfolk were staring at them was not  something I would want to be on the receiving end of,” she said.  “Something’s happening, and you two should go investigate it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nuh-uh,”  Natsuki and Midori said at once.  They gave each other a look, and  Natsuki proceeded, “You’re going along as protection.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  wasn’t precisely what Midori had planned on saying, and it showed  in her eyes as she stared at Natsuki in disbelief.  “<em>Protection?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akira  sighed.  “You are determined to go alone, Natsuki?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  nodded as though she hadn’t heard Midori, and then turned to face  forward again.  “Everyone out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Natsuki,”  Reito murmured, “You don’t even know where it is you’re going.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  true,” Akira agreed. “You don’t.  Do you see that house up  ahead? The one with the brown tile at the end of the next block?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  took a moment to study where Akira had indicated.  After a moment, a  small, bitter grin slid onto her face. “How long have you been  having your Okuzaki clan watch us, Akira?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  shorter girl grinned a little herself; possibly her first genuine  smile all day.  “Long enough to be embarrassed about not being able  to prevent Shizuru’s kidnapping.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  didn’t want to blow your cover, huh,” Natsuki didn’t sound  angry, but it was a docility that spoke volumes of her true rage;  both at Akira’s clan, and the girl in general.   In the back of her  mind, though, she understood vaguely that in the grand scheme of  things, the Okuzaki clan’s anonymity was more important than the  safety of any one person, to them.  She couldn’t honestly blame  them for not butting in. She would have made the same decision.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  it’s Shizuru, and that makes it…<br />
  Makes  it what?<br />
  Inexcusable? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Waitaminute,”  Midori said, suddenly excited.  “You mean to tell me that the  Okuzaki clan of Ninja is still…God, that’s one of Japan’s most  archaic…and you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut  up, Midori,” Natsuki said mildly.  “You can be an anthropologist  later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Later.”  Natsuki actually smiled, feeling a little better as Midori’s  overwhelming obsession with her profession once again stole her away  from the morbidity of their present circumstances. “Out. All of  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Natsuki…”  Reito began, but Natsuki didn’t let him finish.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  too, Reito.  Shut up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A very  special talent that many women possess that most men lack is the  ability to end a conversation without really ending it; without any  sort of “this conversation is over” or “piss off,” they can  speak volumes via some mystic combination of their tone and their  aura pertaining to the current status of their conversation.  Men are  only just perceptive enough to pick up on it, usually; in this case  Reito felt it pummeling him like a desert wind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He got  out of the car without another word, because he knew that if he was  going to speak again, he would probably say something he would regret  later; like, “yes, ma’am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  last one out of the car was Midori, who lingered for a few moments.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Natsuki,  you’d better not be planning on doing what I think you’re  planning on doing,” Midori said evenly.  “Because if you are…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you are, then you shouldn’t. It’s a mistake, and a big one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  the professor were in danger,” Natsuki asked as mildly as she had  before, “wouldn’t you do the same thing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  gasped, froze for a moment, and Natsuki realized that she’d struck  a nerve; though which one, she wasn’t entirely certain.  Before she  could ask, the door slammed shut and Midori walked way at the pace of  a privately raging woman.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And even  so, in spite of inviting the rage of an untold number of people in  that town, and among her friends, in the span of five minutes, as  soon as Midori was clear of the car, she jammed down the gas pedal.  Behind her, the first ambulances and fire trucks began to arrive, and  she thought, <em>too little, too late.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  story of my life.</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  first man died without having any idea that he was in the middle of a  war. On Minoru’s infra-red scope, there was a short flash of red as  his bullet impacted with the man’s head and exploded, and then his  form dropped and its shade of red got lighter.  Minoru never even saw  his face, which was unusual for him; usually the one part of his  target he <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">did </span></em>see was the whites of his eye.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Funny</em>,  he thought. <em>Usually, when you shoot a man, he starts to stain a  darker shade of red.  This time, it’s the opposite.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s  only a job. Stop being introspective; that’s something that  puddle-of-angst snipers do. </em>A commonly accepted fact in Minoru’s  world was that puddles of angst rapidly got over themselves, or they  became puddles of blood in short order.  Even during the lazy  years—he had actually seen snipers die because they were too busy  angsting over the people they were killing, or being introspective  over the meaning of life through a bullet, or some such nonsense.  He  was happy to be removed from that, dammit. <em>Get a grip on yourself. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  took a moment to remember to pull the slide on the side of the gun  back again, dropping the old shell, chambering a new one.  The really  high-caliber weapons needed to be manually cocked—an automatic  mechanism was frailer than a manual one, and these things kicked like  a motherfucker—certainly hard enough to bust up a badly  put-together system.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The next  person he thought less about.  He was only a couple feet away, and  Minoru put a bullet through his skull without bothering to think  about how he couldn’t see panic through an IR scope.  He didn’t  give a fuck.  He was a sniper, not a philosopher, and this was <em>only  a job. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A red  blob appeared on his scope in about five places in the house; it  started out very small for a moment, but only a moment, during which  Minoru was positively baffled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  was, until he realized that the people were slowly starting to blend  into the blobs of red.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Fucking  space heaters you’ve got to be SHITTING ME. </em>It took Minoru all  of five picoseconds to understand that these guys had definitely been  forewarned as to his presence.  He wondered for a moment if he’d  been betrayed, but realized he probably hadn’t been.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  Alder was not generally a lucky man, or if he was, he didn’t tend  to bother about it.  He was a firm believer that luck got a man  killed if he relied on it too much.  In fact, he mostly took luck as  just another form of skill; something that he set up by himself and  just happened to fall into place a little better than he had planned  on.  In that respect, he was a little like a spoiled child; he had  come very close to dying a few times, but as a general rule, things  for him had gone pretty well during his lifetime.  Besides, a lot of  times, those near-death experiences had more to do with his ex-wife  than anything else.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Today,  though; today was different.  Today, Minoru Alder was a very, very  lucky man.  He started searching, slowly, for targets in the house,  frustrated that he had to go so slowly because with each second he  wasted, any targets—they were moving around to distract his aim, <em>somebody fucking </em>warned <em>them </em>which meant that he  couldn’t get a solid shot on any one of them.  As he did this, for  just the barest second, something flashed in his eye.  The kind of  flash that you got from a laser aimer or light off of metal. For the  barest instant, he was blinded, and in that instant, he thought, <em>laser aimer…?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  flung himself to the roof of the building instinctually, and in the  next instant, a bullet whizzed above where his eye had been in the  instant previous. <em>Off to your left, </em>he thought, and then: <em>What the fuck?  They have another sniper?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  thumbed his radio.  “Hey, you over there,” he said, praying that  Scratch-ass hadn’t chosen now, of all moments, to go sit on the  pot.  “I’ve got an enemy sniper on me; I think that guy from  before relocated. Can you see him?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was no answer, and he rolled over about a yard and a half, also by  instinct, an instant before another shot cracked through the wall  where he’d been. <em>One second-two-second-three-second-roll or  die.  That’s how long it takes a guy to throw a bullet in the pie. </em>A nonsense rhyme he’d made up one night when he was drunk, a  night he commonly regarded as the best drunk of his life, mostly  because the rhyme had saved his ass more than a few times.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Son  of a bitch now is </em>NOT<em> the time to be taking a shit,  scratch-ass! </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Three-second  roll or </em>he rolled and another bullet cracked through the wall.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Fine  then, fuck you right back. </em>Minoru hadn’t had an old-fashioned  sniper duel in years, but he still knew how to do the dance. <em>I am  almost forty years old, and I’m willing to bet you’re not more  than twenty, by the way you shoot as fast as you can </em>he rolled  over <em>reload. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Also,  he’s got… </em>Minoru glanced at the wall in front of him and  gauged the size of the hole as best he could.  He couldn’t get a  real measurement, so he filed it under the <em>really fucking big </em>class.  The same kind as he had. <em>And an IR scope—that’s  how he can see me through the wall.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  like betrayal niggled at the back of his head, and he shoved it out  of the way for the moment.  Now was the time to—roll two feet to  the right as pieces of brick showered him painfully—think.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>This  clip holds six shots. There are four bullet holes, and the one that  almost took off my head at the beginning. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then,  immediately after, a number of thoughts at once:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>How  long will it take him to reload?<br />
  Is it  really the same gun? Will it hold more?<br />
  What  if he’s fighting with one in the chamber?<br />
  What  if he’s not?<br />
  What  if you can’t roll over in time?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  rolled over twice and one more bullet cracked through the roof, and  then all of the thoughts vanished.  He stood up, looked straight  through his scope, and saw exactly who he was looking for—a red  blob in the window across from him, half-calmly yanking the clip out  of his rifle, grabbing a new one, and</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">s<em>queeze.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Dropping  to the ground, with a big fat fucking hole in his head. Minoru  lowered the gun, grinning with satisfaction, to see who exactly it  was he’d killed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  couldn’t really see very well, to be fair.  The building was far  enough away from him that it was hard to make much out, but he did  see one thing very clearly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He’d  just shot the other man in black.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Son  of a bitch, </em>he thought, but not so much because he was rapidly  coming to understand that he’d been betrayed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rather,  he cursed to himself in that instant because he knew that there were  plenty more Men in Black, and even if none of them were presently  watching him, they’d be gunning for him soon enough. <em>Nobody who  has the kind of resources to throw out a man at will has only one Man  in Black. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  that, he thought, and the fact that he didn’t have a way to get out  of town.  He hoped he still remembered how to hotwire a car.  There  were no idiotic thoughts of vengeance in his mind—he knew better  than that.  Now, he thought, was the time for running.  Fast.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  started by running for the roof exit.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Natsuki  turned left at the intersection before the one she would have needed  to take to get to the house, and pulled up at the curb.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Inhale.<br />
  Exhale.<br />
  Just  like before.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Trouble  was, it had been so long that “before” was starting to become  blurry in her mind.  It had been a long time since she’d fought  anybody outside of a dojo, and she didn’t honestly know how up to  par her skills were.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Then  use your head, fuckwit, and don’t fight if you don’t have to.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shook her head and got out of the car, shut the door, but didn’t  lock it.  There was nothing inside to steal, and it was better to be  able to get in quickly in a pinch.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Or is  it better to lock it so that somebody has to break a window to lie in  wait for you?<br />
  Either  one could get you killed, but you can’t do both. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  sighed, a little depressed at her inability to decide; she’d never  been this bad before, had she? Of course not. She was nervous.  Nervous that she’d mess it up, and then<br />
      <em>head  in pieces on her blouse and the floor behind</em><br />
  some <em>unnamed </em>evil may befall Shizuru.  She made sure to mentally  shout <em>unnamed, </em>to drill it into her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the  end, she locked the door and stuffed the keys in her pants pocket;  they were tight but secure there. Since the car had an electric lock,  she could unlock it on the run and be much safer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  crept through the yard between her and the house as quickly as she  could; she was creeping more out of habit that was, much to her  delight, steadily beginning to creep its way back into her mind.  She  pulled out her cell phone and her gun about midway through, and  dialed Shizuru’s number again.  She picked up on the first ring and  said, in a remarkably calm voice, “Hello?” As though she had no  idea at all who was calling her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where  are you?” Natsuki asked in a hushed voice as she squinted to see  inside the window of the house that was facing her.  A moment later,  satisfied that she wasn’t being watched from that side, she started  to move, quickly but quietly, towards it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I am  in the basement.  There is a window nearby, but I can’t get out of  it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where  is the entrance to the basement?”  Natsuki pressed herself against  the wall of the building.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t know.” A pause, and Natsuki started inching towards the  door.  “Are you coming to rescue me, Natsuki?” A tone  of…amusement? Disbelief? Condescension?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  didn’t say anything for a moment.  Her heart was now hammering in  her chest for more than one reason, and her grip on her gun—right  handed, as always—was very, very tight; her finger was locked right  on top of the trigger, but the safety was still on. Incidentally, her  thumb was on that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  guess I am,” she said quietly into the phone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  should I take that, Natsuki?” Shizuru’s voice was as calm and  solid as a frozen lake, though nowhere near as cold.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please,”  Natsuki whispered, her breath coming in shorter breaths now, more  rapid.  “Not now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When,  then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Later.  Just not—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  are you?” The man’s voice wasn’t particularly afraid  considering he was only peeking his head out the door, which covered  the rest of his body.  Natsuki closed the phone immediately and  dropped that hand to her side, twisted her body so that her gun was  behind her back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He was  staring at her in the way that all armed people stare at other armed  people: Nervously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  doubled her gun hand back and aimed it at his head.  She saw the  barrel of a shotgun peeking out of the door, saw it freeze as her  weapon lined up with his head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There  are about ten cops two blocks away,” he said carefully, his eyes  locked onto the weapon with a kind of nervous fascination.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sure they’d be delighted to find you with a nineteen year old girl  locked in your basement,” Natsuki countered.  “Move.  I don’t  want to hurt you, but I will.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?  Is the girl down there worth the lives of eight men to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That hit  her deeper than he’d intended for many reasons and on many levels,  but she managed to keep her face deadpan.  “It’s not a question  of worth right now.  You people are in my way, and if you don’t  move, I’ll deal with you.” She let it sit at that, pulled the  hammer on her weapon back; this was strictly for effect, as the  weapon could be fired without touching the hammer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Could  you kill all of us, do you think?” he mused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you’re speaking ethically…” Natsuki grinned. “I’ve killed  more than eight people in my lifetime.  The person downstairs has  killed many more than I have.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  frowned, and Natsuki narrowed her eyes.  “Count of three.  If the  gun doesn’t hit the ground and I don’t see your <em>whole </em>body,  hands in the air—” she didn’t get to finish the sentence; he  vanished into the door.  She cursed and clicked the safety off of the  gun, and leapt up onto the nearby windowsill.  After a moment’s  hesitation, she clicked the safety back on the gun, flipped it so  that she was holding the barrel, and shattered the window with the  butt before dropping back to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A moment  later and another reversal and safety <em>click </em>later, she was  inside. She moved slowly now, her footsteps nearly silent, her weapon  held out in front of her in a two-handed grip, her left hand cupped  under her right. The house was completely silent, though the door had  closed itself behind her with a small <em>click. </em>It seemed that  her distraction had done very little overall.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  moved very, very carefully, sweeping each room for people, doors,  hiding places, before she moved in full view of it, acting with a  skill borne from years of paranoia.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  found herself, shortly, in a hallway.  The hallway had only three  ways out: A door to a kitchen on her right; a staircase straight  ahead—long, wooden, and a little creepy in its utter  straightness—and where she’d come from.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  swept the kitchen.  Left. Cabinet and Fridge.  Right.  Wall and  window.  Up. Tiled ceiling, light. Down.  Cabinets.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  house was utterly silent.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  moved into the kitchen.  There was only one exit: A staircase.  Downward. <em>Bingo. </em>She began to advance, never losing her sense  of caution.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Step.<br />
  Step.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  creaked behind her.  She whirled around and had about half a second  to dive forward and left before the man she’d seen earlier fired  his shotgun straight into the kitchen.  The buckshot pellets sprayed  a wide pattern, carving a rough ellipse in the wall behind her.  A  pellet grazed her shoulder, making her wince.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t let him get off a second shot.  His eyes widened a little as  she went flying towards him, moving on instinct rather than  intelligence.  Intelligence would have been to shoot him. Instinct  was to land a solid kick in his midsection, buckling him.  His breath  left him in a <em>woof</em>, and she followed it up with a flat-palm to  his nose.  He didn’t drop his shotgun, but blood gouted and he  staggered backwards, shouting in pain.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Still  eyeing the shotgun, she used his momentary incapacitation to grab his  gun hand with her free one.  She straightened it out as best she  could in the half-second she had, and drove her gun hand butt-first  into the elbow, which broke with a sickening <em>crack. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ichi!”  another person up the stairs.  He had an axe.  She wouldn’t have so  much luck with hand-to-hand fighting an axe; therefore, it was  instinctual to her what she did next, too: She raised her weapon and  fired once, twice, three times into his body, aiming for the chest  with the first shot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  Kuga carried a rather unrealistic weapon for somebody of her size: It  was technically a Heckler and Koch Mark 23 SOCOM, (a military weapon  that her contact had bitched about for months before he finally  accepted her payment—very <em>hefty </em>payment—and gave it to  her) but it had been more accurately described earlier as an “Illegal  howitzer.”  It’s .45 ACP rounds were specifically tailored for  stopping power at range, probably under the assumption that anybody  that it was being fired at was <em>also </em>a man with a  military-class physical training.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At the  range that Natsuki was at, about ten feet, it really did act like a  howitzer. The man’s chest exploded backwards; then his right arm at  the shoulder, then the corner of his head.  The stairs behind him  were instantly slick with what used to be inside the man, and Natsuki  looked away.  It was enough to make anybody look away; she had been  prepared to kill him, but not that gruesomely.  The man at her feet  shouted something, and she walked away from him, told him absently  that he should “kick the shotgun into a corner and leave now,  before I shoot you.”  She knew he’d complied when the door  slammed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  descent down the stairs was easy.  There was no blood soaking this  staircase. At the bottom, there was a man who just stared at her; she  pointed her gun at him, and he shrugged and opened the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  there was Shizuru.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve  come to rescue me,” the girl said a little bitterly.  “How  wonderful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let’s  go,” Natsuki said quietly.  “Now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  nodded and started walking towards her, and then the man spoke.  “Did  you have to kill Nayo?” he asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  nodded to him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He  was more with them than he was with us.  He was truly desperate.”  The man looked at her with sad eyes. “I am sorry to see him die,  but I can appreciate his death nonetheless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In that  moment, Natsuki had no coherent thoughts.  Only the undeniable  impression that maybe this man was, somehow, more of a warrior than  she would ever be.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or maybe  it was the opposite.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe it  was that what blocked this man from being…whatever it is that he  wanted to be…was far stronger than whatever blocked her from…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  said, “I’m very sorry about Nayo,” quietly.  “And about Nobu  and Keitaro as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The man  shook his head.  “It wasn’t your fault, Shizuru Fujino.”  He  gave a small bow.  “Nobu and Keitaro least of all.  We think they  were taken out by a sniper.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  frowned.  “A sniper? Whose?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He gave  her a bitter smile.  “How should I know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yeah.   How should you know? You’re just the one who does the killing. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Or  the dying.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you for everything,” Shizuru whispered, her voice tight. Natsuki  saw tears in her eyes.  The man nodded back, not looking at her, and  then said, “Go.  We’ll try our best and escape; don’t you worry  about us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  nodded mutely, and then looked at Natsuki strangely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  didn’t understand, but somehow felt that she’d done something  horrible in that instant.  Later, Shizuru would deny it, but for now  there was zero comfort on that end.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All  right, then,” Natsuki said.  “Lets go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So they  did.</span></p>
