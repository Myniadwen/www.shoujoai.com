<p>The  Breaking Point</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Geh!” I yelped as  my body crashed into the nearest tree. I could literally hear the  bones that made up my rib cage crack upon contact. Once I hit the  ground, I drew my knees up to my chest, curling into a fetal position  while wrapping my hands around my torso as my entire body quivered  with pain. I could feel the cold shadow of the scorpion-like orphan  cover me, and I mustered up the strength to turn my head skyward.
<p>How  had I gotten myself into this situation? Not two minutes ago I had  simply been about to investigate a building my informant Yamada had  told me was <em>“suspicious with First  District activity.”</em> I had driven  about four miles from the Rorschach bar, my usual hot spot, on my  motorcycle to this small building in the middle of nowhere. I parked  my bike in the woods and had begun walking towards the place when the  thing ambushed me. I mentally kicked myself for not even seeing it  coming. I should have been more alert, but I was expecting to  encounter more along the lines of light security, not a huge creature  from god knows where. Before I could even react to the thing, it had  knocked me back with a swing of one of its arms, the force strong  enough to lift me from the ground and slam me into the tree directly  behind me.</p>
<p>Now it loomed over me,  pincers slowly pinching at the thin air, black beady eyes staring  down at me as its talon mouth oozed with mucus. I watched as the  monster took another step forward before reaching down and picking me  up in its right pincer. I felt the boney claws pierce through my  biker suit and slide under my skin, and as it squeezed me tighter, I  not only heard this time, but I also felt the bones of my lower rib  cage snap. I cried out in pain, my breath like smoke in the cold  December air.</p>
<p>Darkness began to  consume me, conscious fading fast. In a last ditch effort, I summoned  my element with my one free arm, and although my vision was blurred,  I aimed for the scorpion’s multiple eyes and began shooting. The  creature screeched in pain, a yellow liquid squirting from the injury  I had just caused, and to my luck, it dropped me in the process. I  landed with a thud, and through a fit of coughing, I weakly called  out for my Child.</p>
<p>A wall of ice  surrounded me sprouting out in every direction before the silver wolf  emerged from within, immediately lunging for the orphan once he had  broke free of his icy cage. Still in a state of hysteria, the  scorpion creature didn’t even sense Duran’s presence until he had  latched on to one of its legs, ripping the appendage off in one  immensely powerful tug. The monster stumbled to the ground, releasing  another inhuman cry of pain.</p>
<p>Not wanting to be  completely useless, I took aim once more and fired off a round of  energy blasts as Duran assaulted the creature from behind. Before  long, our onslaught resulted in victory, the Orphan disappearing into  the ground like a liquid being absorbed by a sponge.</p>
<p>Adrenaline beginning to  wear thin, the pain of my torso steadily grew more and more. I leaned  against the nearest trunk as my breathing became heavy and difficult.  I heard Duran emit a low whimper as he stopped beside me, nudging me  with his nose, and I placed my shaky hand on his muzzle.</p>
<p>“I-I’ll be fine…”</p>
<p>He whined again,  knowing very well that I wasn’t being completely honest.</p>
<p>I  lowered myself to the ground to rest as the silver wolf lied down  beside me, placing his head in my lap. I stroked Duran’s metallic  head just like he was my old dog as I stared up at the starry sky,  ignoring the blood that was seeping through my leather suit. My  eyelids were becoming increasingly heavy, but I somehow manage to  stay awake.</p>
<p><em>So, is this the  life…of a HiME? Will it always be battle after battle…life or  death? Am I…going to survive this?</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…<em>Mother…</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…<em>No, I can’t  give up…not this easily…I still…have so much—!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, Duran’s  head snapped up, the lithe wolf producing a deep growl from his  throat in the process.</p>
<p>“Is something  coming?” I whispered at I follow his gaze, and sure enough, I could  hear footsteps quickly approaching.</p>
<p>“Is someone there?  This is a restricted area…” the voice boomed.</p>
<p>“Dammit,” I cursed,  “Come on, Duran…We’ve…got to get out of here…”</p>
<p>Duran stood and helped  pull me to my feet, which turned out to be quite a laborious effort.  Running was out of the question, and walking was barely possible as I  soon found out, leaning onto my silver Child just to stay upright.  The two of us tried to hovel in the direction of my bike, but the man  behind us was approaching too fast. Directing us to the nearest and  largest tree, I ordered Duran to disappear as I slumped behind the  thick grey trunk, peering around it to see exactly where our guest  was.</p>
<p>That’s when I saw  it…red plastic amongst the dead grass. My eyes widened as my hand  immediately went to my pocket.</p>
<p><em>It’s not here…</em></p>
<p>I looked back again to  confirm my horror.</p>
<p>My cell phone was lying  out in the open, ripe for the picking.</p>
<p>I saw the man emerge  from the line of trees, his flashlight scoping the area like a  lighthouse keeps a close eye on the sea. Of course, it was at this  very precise moment that my phone decided to vibrate, the outer  display lighting up brightly in the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I  didn’t just turn the damn thing off. The bimbo wouldn’t have even  seen it otherwise. Sometimes I utterly amaze myself with my own  stupidity…</p>
<p>My heart stopped as I  watched the beam of light land directly on my cell. The guy walked  closer and panic kicked in.</p>
<p><em>Shit, shit, shit!  He’ll be able to trace that back to me…I never deleted my texts  from Yamada…</em></p>
<p>And then it hit me.</p>
<p><em>Oh god, Shizuru’s  number is in there!</em></p>
<p>The officer bent down  to pick up the phone.</p>
<p>I summoned my element, and without any hesitation, I fired.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
About an hour later I  was sitting in the private clinic of Dr. Watanabe, a physician that  Yamada had informed me of when we first met. Apparently the man was  used to aiding those people in the world like myself who participated  in the shadier activities of life. The process was simple enough: you  paid him, he did his work, and he didn’t ask any questions, which  is probably what I liked the best about him. It made things a lot  less painful when you didn’t have to worry about explaining how you  got the injuries on top of dealing with them.
<p>After receiving several  stitches on my right side and having my torso properly bandaged, the  doctor gave me some extra materials so that I would be able to change  the bandages on my wounds myself along with instructions on how to do  it properly and at what time intervals to change them. I thanked him  and headed back out onto the streets to my motorcycle. Luckily Dr.  Watanabe had given me some pretty powerful painkillers, so the ride  back home wouldn’t be nearly as excruciating as the ride to his  office had been.</p>
<p>Once I made it back to  my building, I made sure to take the elevator up to my sixth floor  loft apartment instead of taking my usual stair route. After dragging  myself inside and up the stairs, I headed for the bathroom, setting  the bag of medical supplies from Dr. Watanabe on the counter. I  carefully pulled off my biker suit, leaving it in a crumpled pile on  the floor for now. It would need to be replaced anyway, considering  the blood and holes that were now a part of it, but that was the  least of my concerns at the moment.</p>
<p>Gazing at the mirror, I  took in the reflected image of myself for the first time since the  fight. I was bruised and nicked up just about everywhere, but luckily  my face had seemed to avoid too much damage. My torso on the other  hand was a completely different story. Bloody bandages covered the  wounds, but curious to see the extent of my injuries, I slowly began  to peel them away.</p>
<p>The first thing to see  was the deep bruising around my ribs where the orphan had tried, and  nearly succeeded in, squeezing the life out of me. My skin was  already a purplish black color in an odd shape like someone had  splattered me with paint. Next were the several cuts that lined my  sides. They almost resembled the gills of a fish in a way. The doctor  had stitched up the ones of the right side since I had pulled and  ripped the tissue when firing at the scorpion’s face. Then there  was the fact that the lower section of my left ribcage had indeed  been broken. I made sure to keep those bandages in place for now, not  wanting to agitate the shattered bone.</p>
<p>Once I was finished  gawking at my battered self, I wrapped the bandages back around my  midsection. Taking the bottle of pills from the bag and making sure  to prepare myself a glass of water, I decided not to bother with  trying to put any other clothing on, and instead I just made my way  to my bed and carefully lied down on my back.</p>
<p><em>Well, tonight was a  complete failure. That inspection was only supposed to take me thirty  minutes, an hour at tops, and then I was going to—! </em></p>
<p>My body jerked at my  realization, which only caused me to grimace even more than I already  was.</p>
<p><em>Dammit! I was  supposed to pick Shizuru up at the airport…I should call—no I  can’t cause my phone is a smoldering lump of charcoal now, dumb  ass… Why did Yamada have to call today of all days? And why did I  just HAVE to agree to meet him and go out to that godforsaken place? </em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>I wonder if Shizuru  made it back all right…If she’s mad at me…I should go over to  her place tomorrow…eh…but I can’t like THIS…</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>Tonight was way too  close. What if that guy had gotten my phone? That would have caused a  lot of problems…at least that didn’t go wrong…but…still…if  he had gotten a hold of it…and if he was part of the First  District…</em></p>
<p>…<em>Shizuru…</em></p>
<p><em>I…I’m putting  her in danger…our friendship…I could get her…killed…</em></p>
<p>I closed my eyes, jaw  clenching as my hands formed into fists.</p>
<p><em>I can’t do it  anymore…I can’t risk her life like this…I shouldn’t have even  allowed myself to get close to her…knowing what I was doing…I’m  so fucking stupid…</em></p>
<p>And that was it. I knew  that I had to let her go for her own good. There had always been a  slight distance between us since I didn’t want her to get involved  with my secret activities outside of school, but now I would have to  completely sever myself from her. It pained me to think that I would  have to say goodbye to the one person in my life that I even remotely  cared for, but a living Shizuru was much better than a dead one. As  long as she was alive we could still communicate some, right? But  only at school…and only on occasions…I couldn’t put her in  unnecessary danger any longer. I wouldn’t.</p>
<p>But how was I supposed  to go about doing this? Was I supposed to slowly back off? Drop her  cold turkey? She’d move on. She was popular and loved by the entire  student body. She didn’t need me when she could be friends with<em>anyone</em> at Fuuka.</p>
<p>Right, she might be a  little upset at first, but she’d get over it.</p>
<p>At least, that’s what I thought.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I spent the last week  of winter break mostly in bed trying to recover. I actually made  quite a bit of progress, surprisingly. Maybe that was because of my  HiME powers, but either way, I was certainly feeling a lot better  than I had.
<p>The first couple of  days were strictly spent in bed, even though I thought I was going to  die from the boredom. At least it gave me some time to study, I  guess. Once I felt well enough to move, I started walking around  inside the apartment some, testing out what I could and couldn’t  do. I found out I was okay with walking, albeit slower than I usually  did. I had to be careful with sitting though. I had to get in one  particular position for it not to bother me. I dreaded thinking about  the desks at school, but I still had two more days until I would have  to cross that path so maybe, just maybe, by that time I’d be able  to move a little bit more without it shooting sharp pains up and down  my sides.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that also  meant I had two days until I would have to face Shizuru again. I had  no idea how she would react when she saw me. I mean, I hadn’t shown  up at the airport, and then on top of that, I never got in contact  with her for an entire week. She didn’t know where I lived. My  phone was destroyed, so it wasn’t like one of us could call the  other. Pay phones weren’t out of the question, but they were pretty  useless when you didn’t have the person’s number written down or  memorized.</p>
<p>She probably thought I  was dead.</p>
<p><em>Heh, she’d  probably be better off if I was…</em></p>
<p>Maybe she’d be so  pissed at me that she wouldn’t want to talk to me ever again. Yeah,  that’d be nice. That would make things much easier, but somehow I  doubted that was going to be the case.</p>
<p>I wished I could just  be honest with her…tell her the truth about all that was going  on…but I knew that I couldn’t. She was an innocent individual.  She didn’t deserve to know about all this, to be burdened with it  like I was. I would spare her from all that. That’s all I could do  as her friend, even if it meant destroying the relationship we had  formed in the process.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The awful blaring of my  alarm clock signaled the beginning of dooms day.
<p>I really didn’t want  to go to school, and I probably wouldn’t have if it weren’t for  the tests my teachers were giving to see if we had actually studied  any over the break. When I reluctantly crawled out of bed, I slipped  into the long-sleeved version of my school uniform, and after a quick  breakfast and downing a painkiller, I threw the bottle with it’s  few pills into my brown bag and headed out the door.</p>
<p>Deciding to risk it, I  drove my bike to school. The ride was a little uncomfortable, but it  wasn’t unbearable. Besides, anything was better than riding the  jam-packed buses in the morning in my personal opinion.</p>
<p>Once I arrived on  campus and parked my bike in it’s usual hiding spot in the woods, I  slowly made my way to my building. I didn’t know when or where I  would see Shizuru, I didn’t know if I would see her at all to be  perfectly honest, but this morning apparently wasn’t going to be  the time for us to talk as I entered my building without spotting  her.</p>
<p>The day went by rather  quickly for once; I guess that was because we were pretty much taking  tests and quizzes the entire time. When lunchtime came around, I  snuck into the bathroom to slip another painkiller. The school didn’t  allow the students to bring medicine of any kind without written  permission from a doctor, and even then you usually had to go to the  school nurse, Ms. Sagisawa, to retrieve it unless there was special  circumstances. I, of course, decided to disregard that rule and take  my chances.</p>
<p>Leaving the bathroom, I  headed for the cafeteria. It was shared by the middle school and the  high school so it was always pretty busy come lunchtime. I slipped in  and got in line, keeping a lookout for Shizuru, but I still hadn’t  spotted her even after I bought my food. Had she gone to our spot in  the stairwell? It certainly was likely. I began walking in that  direction, but when I found myself outside the door, I couldn’t  make myself go in. Why was I dreading this conversation so much? Had  I really become this dependant, this attached, to this one girl?</p>
<p>“<em>You’re going to  have to do it sooner or later,”</em> my mind spoke up, <em>“You at  least owe her some kind of explanation. It’s not fair to her to  just stop talking all of a sudden…”</em></p>
<p>I couldn’t agree more  with myself, but right now wasn’t the time.</p>
<p>‘<em>Right now’ is  never going to be the time, is it?</em></p>
<p>I spent the rest of the  day going through scenario after scenario of how I thought the  conversation with Shizuru might go. I was absolutely dreading what I  had to do, but if I didn’t do it, something horrible might happen  to her. If she were to be hurt in any form or fashion on my  account…Well, let’s just say I wouldn’t be able to deal with  that.</p>
<p>When the last bell of  the day finally rang, I packed my bag and walked out of the building.  A light snow had started falling, the white pieces slowly drifting  down from the clear sky, disappearing as soon as it touched the  ground. I had to walk in front of the high school building to get to  my bike, and it was then that I saw Shizuru walking out, conversing  with a small group of girls. Most people wouldn’t have been able to  tell since she wore such a perfect mask to hide her emotions, but I  saw her flinch ever so slightly when she first noticed me.</p>
<p>Emerald met crimson  despite the distance.</p>
<p>Changing my direction,  my feet began to carry me toward the place where we first met. I  could feel her eyes following me. She knew where I was headed, it  would take her a moment to get away from her classmates, but she  would be there as soon as she could.</p>
<p>And for the first time  since I had met Shizuru, I wished that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>Once I made it to the  gardens, I stood alone in the courtyard, hoping beyond hope that the  chestnut haired beauty wouldn’t appear…that I wouldn’t have to  do what I knew in my heart I had to do.</p>
<p>I had only been  standing there about a minute or so before I heard footsteps fast  approaching.</p>
<p>“Natsuki!”</p>
<p><em>This is it…</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The bell had just rung  and already half the class was out the door. I slid my books into my  bag and began walking out of the room when some of the girls in my  class decided to bring me into their conversation. They were talking  about what they did over the break and asked me what I had done. I  simply told them I had gone to Kyoto to visit with relatives. Nothing  special, I had lied to them, which seemed to satisfy them enough not  to ask any further questions.
<p>Our little group exited  the building, continuing our light chitchat when I nearly stopped  breathing.</p>
<p><em>Natsuki…</em></p>
<p>Was I dreaming? No, I  couldn’t be. She was there, right in front of me. She noticed me as  well, our eyes meeting for a brief moment before she turned and  headed in the opposite direction. Of course she wouldn’t risk  talking in public…I knew where she would be waiting though.</p>
<p>Anxious to go see her,  I made up a quick excuse as to why I had to leave, and took off at a  brisk jog towards the garden. Once I was out of eyesight, I sprinted  the rest of the way, my breath visibly coming out in quick little  puffs.</p>
<p>Her lone figure soon  came into view, which only caused me to run harder.</p>
<p>“Natsuki!” I called  out to her back.</p>
<p>The girl turned to face  me. I noticed that she seems stiff, her breathing almost restricted,  but because of her uniform, I couldn’t see anything for sure.</p>
<p>“Hey…”</p>
<p>“Hey? Is that all you  can say to me?” I asked, my generally calm composure nowhere to be  found.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“God, I’ve been so  worried about you...You never showed up at the airport, I couldn’t  get through on your phone, you never called, you didn’t come by the  dorm…nothing. What happened? Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“And you couldn’t  at least let me know that?”</p>
<p>“…Sorry.”</p>
<p>“So what happened?”</p>
<p>“Something came up.  It was an emergency.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you  just tell me that? I would have understood.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me,  it’s one of your little secrets again, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Honestly, I let it  slide most times, you not telling me what you’ve really been doing,  and I just put up with it, but I can’t this time. I just can’t.  After a week of not knowing if you were safe…if you were alive…You  owe me an explanation this time, Natsuki.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,  Shizuru.”</p>
<p>“Sorry isn’t going  to work, Natsuki, not this time. I was sick with worry. I haven’t  slept in days. Do you know what that’s like?”</p>
<p>This seemed to affect  her, the side of her mouth twitching slightly.</p>
<p>“Don’t…Don’t  worry about me, Shizuru. In fact, you’d be better off if you’d  just forget about me all together...”</p>
<p><em>Wha-What?</em></p>
<p>“…Just, leave me  alone from now on, alright?”</p>
<p><em>Natsuki…</em></p>
<p>“…I think we should  stop hanging out after school and stuff…”</p>
<p><em>What are you…</em></p>
<p>“…You don’t need  to hang around someone like me anyway. I’m trouble. I’ll only  cause you problems, so just…keep away…”</p>
<p><em>Y-You’re not being  serious…are you?</em></p>
<p>“…Besides, you know  plenty of people, you don’t need me—“</p>
<p><em><strong>Smack!</strong></em></p>
<p>I had wanted to say  something to make her stop this nonsense, to make her stop saying  those horrible things. My mouth would move, but I couldn’t form any  words…so instead my hand unconsciously took over.</p>
<p>I gasped at my own  action. Had I really just…smacked Natsuki? My hand tingled as it  remained frozen in midair. My whole body trembled as I watched her  cheek become red. It usually turned that color because of me, but  never like this before. Oh how I wished she was blushing from another  spell of my constant teasing right now…</p>
<p>She kept her head  turned away from me for several moments before slowly turning to face  me again. Her eyes were void of any emotion, her expression  completely blank.</p>
<p>I drew my hand to my  chest, tears forming in my eyes, “Natsuki, I—“</p>
<p>“I deserved that, I  know,” she interrupted me, “I deserve a lot worse than that  actually…I’m sorry, Shizuru…”</p>
<p>She began to walk away,  but I instinctively reached out and grabbed her by the arm. She  hissed, appearing to be in pain, before snapping her head around to  glare at me out of the corner of her eye.</p>
<p>“Let go.”</p>
<p>I didn’t respond. I  just stared back into those strikingly green orbs, trying desperately  to get some kind of sign from them.</p>
<p>“Let me go, Shizuru!”  she growled through clenched teeth, jerking her arm back with a  twinge of her eye.</p>
<p>She started to take off again, and I tried calling out to her,  desperately call out to her, but she didn’t respond, soon  disappearing from my line of sight…leaving me alone once again.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I somehow managed to  maintain my composure until I got home, and once there, I immediately  fell apart. I sank down to the floor beside my bed, burying my face  in my arms as I sobbed uncontrollably.
<p><em>How could she…?  Just like that…Is our friendship over? Why is she pushing me away  like this? Did I do something wrong? Natsuki…</em></p>
<p>My head continued to  play this cruel little game with me the rest of the night, bashing me  with one negative thought after another. I didn’t eat, I didn’t  move. I just sat there on the floor in a daze. Why was I hurting this  badly? What profound feeling could make me feel this miserable…this  depressed?</p>
<p>And then it dawned on  me…</p>
<p>No, that couldn’t be  it…sure, Natsuki meant a lot to me, more than anyone else in my  life, but it couldn’t be…<em>that</em>…</p>
<p><em>Why not? We know the  way you look at her sometimes…More than a friend would…in ways a  friend wouldn’t…</em></p>
<p>“<em>No…”</em></p>
<p><em>And we know how much  you long to be around her…to hear her voice…to see her…touch  her…</em></p>
<p>“<em>No…”</em></p>
<p><em>A mere friend  wouldn’t feel that way. No, what you feel isn’t just  friendship…you lo—</em></p>
<p>“<em>NO!”</em></p>
<p><em>You </em><em><strong>love</strong></em><em> her. You’re </em><em><strong>in love</strong></em><em> with her.</em></p>
<p>I broke, finally giving  in, letting my mind, my emotions, win. I couldn’t fight it any  more, not after today. After the way I reacted to our conversation,  how could I not admit it?</p>
<p>I was in love with Kuga  Natsuki.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just a  love between comrades. No, it was much deeper than that. So deep in  fact, that it scared me. How had it come to this? When had she crept  into my heart and completely taken control of it in such a way? I  didn’t have the answers, all I knew was how I felt right now at  this very moment.</p>
<p>And now she hated me.  How could she not? Especially after I hit her.</p>
<p><em>How could I have hit  her? How could I have physically stuck that face? That beautiful  face…I swear to you…I’ll never do anything to hurt you again,  Natsuki. I won’t let anything hurt you.</em></p>
<p>It was in the instant of that promise, that vow, that a sharp pain  erupted in my left side, but I ignored it, not even noticing the  faint red dot of light shining through my clothing.</p>
