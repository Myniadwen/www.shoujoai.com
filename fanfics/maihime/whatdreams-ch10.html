<h1>What Dreams May Come (part 10 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leebot.html">Leebot</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/whatdreams-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a>The Machinations of Fujino Shizuru</p><hr><i>Ara… This is too much, Natsuki. I can barely 
write right now; it’s taking all my energy just to keep myself seated at my desk and not 
jumping for joy. My Natsuki has finally decided! Yes, you’re “my Natsuki” now, and I know 
you’re going to enjoy it. I’m certainly going to enjoy being “your Shizuru.”</i></p><p><i>I 
really wish you didn’t have to keep me waiting until you were actually ready to say it, but 
I can understand. I wouldn’t care about getting sick myself just to be with you, especially 
since it would mean I’d get my personal Nurse Natsuki, but I guess you just can’t let 
yourself do that to me if you can help it.</i></p><p><i>That’s probably not all, though. I 
know how hard it is for you to face your feelings. Could it be that you’re still a bit 
scared and need the time to get your courage up? You really don’t have to worry, Natsuki. I 
know I’ve fantasized about doing a lot of things to you that would scare you off if I told 
you right now, but I have no intentions of pushing you into it before you’re ready. You 
don’t have to fear me pouncing on you and ravishing you as soon as you give me your 
decision.</i></p><p><i>I take no responsibility for what I may do to you in my dreams, 
though.</i></p><p><i>Your love,</i></p><p><i>Shizuru</i></p><hr><i>It’s finally going to 
happen tonight! I’m sorry, I’m just too excited right now. I don’t know how I’ll ever be 
able to wait the rest of the day. Maybe I could spend it running intricate fantasies through 
my mind of what we could do once you confess your feelings. Or, maybe I could work a little 
bit more on the plans I have for you tonight.</i></p><p><i>That’s right, I’ve got my own 
devious little scheme set up to help get you in the mood. I wasn’t originally planning to do 
this, but things just kind of feel into my lap. What happened is that yesterday, I got a 
call from Mai saying that she was planning to throw a karaoke party to celebrate you 
recovering tomorrow (she’ll use any excuse to do some karaoke, won’t she?). Don’t worry, I 
made her promise not to force you to sing; it is supposed to be your party after 
all.</i></p><p><i>Well anyways, Mai revealed to me that she’d been talking with you and knew 
what was going on. It was kind of embarrassing to hear that you’d told her, but her news 
that you were better made me no longer care about such trivialities. She told me that she 
thought it might be a good idea for me to do something special for you after the party, to 
help you relax and feel a bit more comfortable about things. So, that’s just what I’ve 
decided to do. I’m still trying to decide between a few things, but of course, by the time 
you’ll be reading this you’ll know what I decided, so I won’t bore you with the details now. 
Until tonight.</i></p><p><i>Your date for tonight,</i></p><p><i>Shizuru</i></p><hr>Shizuru 
checked her watch as she approached the door to the karaoke room Mai had rented: 7:12 p.m. 
Perfect. She was just late enough for Natsuki to start wondering where she was, but not so 
late she’d start worrying. Coming in now would allow her to see a precious moment of joy on 
Natsuki’s face as she forgot herself in front of their friends.</p><p>Setting her mask 
carefully in place, Shizuru opened the door and walked determinedly into the room. She 
quickly caught sight of Natsuki and shifted her gait to walk straight towards the other 
girl. As Natsuki caught sight of her, her face lit up with exactly the joy Shizuru had been 
counting on. In response, Shizuru allowed her mask to slip just a little and let her eyes 
reveal emotions she’d had to hold back for so long, but would finally be able to release 
this night.</p><p>Natsuki seemed to almost be in a trance as she gazed back into Shizuru’s 
eyes. As Shizuru got closer, she let herself gaze deep into Natsuki’s brilliant viridian 
eyes, filled with a little nervousness, some determination, and… Yes, that was certainly 
love there. It was the same soft emotion Shizuru had seen when Natsuki had leaned in to kiss 
her earlier that week, and they’d both finally been able to identify it.</p><p>As Shizuru 
thought about their earlier kiss, she felt herself being drawn towards Natsuki’s lips. She 
let herself glide towards them, bending down to meet her… and felt her leg bump into another 
leg which was most definitely not attached to Natsuki. Her eyes snapped down to it, then 
trailed up the attached body until they found a face which was trying its best not to burst 
out into laughter.</p><p>“Forgive me, Tokiha-san,” Shizuru said, reverting her face back to 
her classic smile. “But I do believe you’re sitting in my seat right now.” A spurt of 
muffled laughter came from behind Shizuru. She hadn’t been paying attention to who was on 
that side of the room, so she couldn’t accurately identify it. Nao seemed like a likely 
candidate, though.</p><p>Mai smiled back at Shizuru and gave her a quick wink. “Oh, it’s no 
problem. I was actually saving it for you, after all.” Mai pushed Mikoto, who had clung onto 
her right side, off farther down the seat and slid over to make room for Shizuru. “Though 
you might want to consider showing up on time if you want a good seat in the future. You 
kept us all waiting, you know.”</p><p>“Ara, was I late?” Shizuru lilted as she turned around 
to take her seat, casually letting her left arm fall across Natsuki’s shoulders but 
pointedly looking away from her and at Mai. “Forgive me, but I had some last-minute 
preparations that just couldn’t wait.”</p><p>As Shizuru turned her head back, she got her 
first chance to take a look at the other residents of the room. Nao was sitting on the right 
side, sipping a drink as she tried to avoid making eye contact with anyone in the room. To 
the left of Nao were Yukino and – to Shizuru’s relief – Haruka. Yukino caught Shizuru’s gaze 
and gave her a smile. A quick flick of her eyes pointed out she currently had her hand 
wrapped around Haruka’s.</p><p>Haruka appeared quite stiff and nervous, and her eyes kept 
darting back and forth as if daring anyone to make mention of what her hand happened to be 
doing. When she caught Shizuru looking at her, though, her eyes quickly flicked away and a 
pink tinge filled her cheeks. Shizuru looked back at Yukino and gave her a proud smile. 
Yukino smiled back and mouthed a quick “Thank you” to Shizuru.</p><p>“Ahem!” Mai had stood 
up and clapped her hands together to get everyone’s attention. “Chie and Aoi weren’t able to 
make it on such short notice, and as you know, Midori-chan’s off adventuring in the Middle 
East and Sister Yukariko is in no condition to be partying. This means that with Fujino-san 
finally here, we’ve got everyone, and it’s time for karaoke!”</p><p>Mai struck a cheerful 
pose as if expecting an outpouring of applause. When the only response she received was a 
snort from Nao, her expression sunk. “Well, since Nao-san seems to be the most enthusiastic 
of the bunch of you – and that’s certainly not saying much – I think I’ll give her the 
privilege of going first.”</p><p>Nao’s eyes widened in rage and she nearly choked on her 
drink. After a coughing spurt she exclaimed, “What!? You can’t make me do that! I’m pretty 
sure it’s a sin to force a nun to make a fool of herself.”</p><p>“Uh-uh,” Mai said, shaking 
her finger at Nao. “You’re not a nun yet, are you? As long as you’re a novice and in my 
karaoke room, I can make you sing whatever I want. You should just be grateful I’m in a 
merciful mood tonight and am going to let everyone pick their own song, or I’d have you do 
something <i>really</i> embarrassing.”</p><p>Nao gave a long, low growl at Mai. “Is it too 
late for me to just leave now?”</p><p>“Not if you don’t mind me telling Chie it’s alright 
for her to make a little extra money selling the pictures she took of you at the party last 
week.” Nao visibly deflated at this. With a sigh and a bowed head, she got up to search 
through the computer for a tolerable song.</p><p>As Natsuki started laughing at Nao’s 
predicament, Shizuru was reminded of the reason she’d come to this party in the first place. 
With that in mind, she let her left arm curl around to start rubbing Natsuki’s shoulder. In 
a surprising move, Natsuki responded by pushing her body over to rub right up against 
Shizuru’s side and leaned her head to rest on Shizuru’s shoulder.</p><p>Shizuru’s heart 
started to race from feeling Natsuki press against her, and a light blush spread to her 
cheeks. She quickly got control over herself and suppressed the blush, hoping no one else 
had noticed. <i>I know what you’re trying to do, Natsuki, and it’s just going to make me 
need to get even. Though tonight, I wonder if that’s actually your plan? Well, far be it for 
me to disappoint you…</i></p><hr>As the party proceeded, Shizuru took more and more 
liberties with her covert teasing of Natsuki, reveling in the reactions she was able to 
provoke. First was letting her left hand drift down to caress Natsuki’s back, which had 
prompted Natsuki to shift her position to expose more of her back to Shizuru. It also had 
the unfortunate side effect of preventing Shizuru from seeing if she was making Natsuki 
blush, but she’d seen it enough times that she could content herself imagining 
it.</p><p>With her attention focused solely on Natsuki, Shizuru was barely aware of the 
activities of the other girls and the songs they sang. She was idly aware of Yukino dragging 
Haruka up on stage for some duet at one point, and Mai seemed to be singing a fair number 
more songs than was rightfully her share, though of course, no one was complaining. As 
Shizuru glanced at the clock, she realized that the time Mai had booked the room for was 
getting to an end, and there was likely only time for one more song. Seeing as she was the 
one outside of Natsuki who had yet to sing, she had a good guess who was going to be the 
grand finale of the little party.</p><p>By this point, Shizuru had progressed to tenderly 
massaging Natsuki’s neck and shoulders. It was amazing how much she could enjoy just simply 
being able to touch Natsuki without the other girl cringing away. She didn’t know how she’d 
be able to handle it when Natsuki would eventually allow her to touch her in even more 
intimate places.</p><p>A devious smile spread across Shizuru’s face as she realized that she 
still had yet to properly get back at Natsuki for making her blush earlier, and she was soon 
to run out of time. <i>Let’s see just how intimate you’re willing to let me be. Feel free to 
stop me with a blush anytime.</i></p><p>Shizuru removed her left hand from Natsuki’s 
shoulder, which prompted an immediate groan of discontent from the girl. She relaxed, 
though, when it made contact with her side and started rubbing downwards. As it reached the 
curve of Natsuki’s hip, Shizuru paused. <i>So far, so good. Now, let’s see that blush!</i> 
Shizuru let her hand dive down and gave Natsuki’s left butt-cheek a tender squeeze.</p><p>If 
she’d done that a few months ago, Natsuki would have jumped halfway across the room. A few 
weeks ago she would have gasped, blushed, and grabbed Shizuru’s hand away. But today, 
Natsuki’s reaction was simply a moan of pleasure. She must have progressed in her own 
feelings a lot more than Shizuru had thought.</p><p>However, Shizuru wasn’t in the mood 
quite yet to revel in that. She’d sworn to make Natsuki blush, and that was what she was 
going to do. With her left hand now massaging Natsuki’s bum, she allowed her right hand to 
drift off of Natsuki’s shoulder and down her side as well. However, this hand had a 
different target from the other. It stopped right above Natsuki’s hip and found the spot 
where Natsuki’s HiME mark used to be.</p><p>Natsuki let out a gasp as Shizuru made contact 
with this point. With a grin, Shizuru proceeded to press her advantage, rubbing in on that 
spot. This elicited another gasp from Natsuki, and she started trembling. Her head stiffly 
turned around to face Shizuru, revealing the blush Shizuru had been waiting all night to 
see. “Shizuru… no fair…”</p><p>“What’s no fair is that you made me work so hard for a simple 
blush,” Shizuru said, removing her hand to hold it in a scolding gesture. She leaned her 
head in to whisper into Natsuki’s ear, “Though if you want fair, I just might have the same 
weakness myself. Of course, now that my HiME mark has faded, you’ll have to manually test 
every square inch of my body to find it. I’m up for it if you are.” Shizuru gave a low purr 
and pulled her head back, letting it take a quick detour to give Natsuki a peck on the cheek 
she was sure no one else would be able to see. As the girl’s face flushed an even deeper 
red, Shizuru felt a throbbing in her chest at the sight.</p><p>“Alright Fujino-san,” Mai 
announced, bringing Shizuru out of her Natsuki-induced trance. “Last song of the night, and 
you’re the only one left to sing. So come on, pick a song.”</p><p>“Ara, I guess I’d better 
go then,” she said to Natsuki, gracing her with a heartfelt smile before she replaced it 
with her normal grin. She removed her left hand from its intimate position and gave Natsuki 
a pat on the shoulder as she rose.</p><p>Shizuru went over to the computer and started 
browsing its selection of songs. Almost all of the songs were either J-pop or Western 
imports, likely to appeal to the expected tastes of the younger generation. <i>Come on, they 
have to have at least one enka song in here… Aha, here we go: Kawa no nagare no yo ni, 
figures that would be their token enka song. I’d prefer something a bit more romantic, but I 
guess this will do. </i>Making her selection, Shizuru walked over to the changing room, 
giving those of the girls who were watching her a quick wave before 
disappearing.</p><p>After a quick perusal of the outfits available, Shizuru picked out a 
flimsy kimono with a sigh. It wasn’t of very good quality, certainly not compared to the 
ones she was used to wearing, but that was to be expected of whatever they’d keep here as a 
costume. Nevertheless, you just couldn’t sing enka without a kimono, and this was the only 
one they had.</p><p>Shizuru changed into the kimono, taking care to make sure everything was 
perfectly in place. It might not have been the best kimono, but if she couldn’t make it look 
perfect on her, then she wasn’t Fujino Shizuru. Once everything was perfect, she pushed the 
curtain aside and strolled up onto the stage, her face in a perfectly graceful expression. 
When she reached the microphone, she gave a bow and caught Natsuki’s gaze on the way 
up.</p><p>Natsuki was quick to cover up her expression, but it was too late; Shizuru had 
seen the admiration in her eyes. <i>Ara, my Natsuki thinks I’m pretty up here!</i> Shizuru 
had to restrain herself from letting a giddy grin break out across her face. It wouldn’t do 
to lose her grace in front of everyone else. There’d be plenty of time for that when she had 
Natsuki alone.</p><p>To distract herself from the thoughts she knew were about to follow, 
Shizuru broke eye contact with Natsuki and looked over at Mai. She gave her a nod to signal 
that she was ready for the music to start. Mai nodded back and pressed a button on the 
computer terminal. She turned back to Shizuru and gave her a thumbs-up as the music started 
to play.</p><p>Shizuru let her eyes close as her body started to sway to the music. She 
didn’t need to read the words for this song; she’d learned it long ago in grade school and 
her affinity for enka meant that it had never slipped her mind. This gave her the freedom to 
allow her eyes to latch onto Natsuki when she reopened them and started to 
sing.</p><p>Though she started singing in perfect control, it started to slip as she felt 
herself being drawn into Natsuki’s brilliant eyes, which had also slipped back into a gaze 
of admiration. With a mental sigh, she decided to switch gears and simply poured out all of 
her emotion into her singing. With Natsuki on her mind, this of course was mostly love, 
which didn’t quite fit the song. But it was still passionate, and at least Natsuki seemed to 
be enjoying it.</p><p>Eventually the song came to a close, and Shizuru forced herself to 
look away from Natsuki to gauge the reaction of the rest of the room. It turned out to be 
unnecessary, as the enthusiastic cheering from Mai, Mikoto, and Yukino would have drawn her 
attention in any case. Even Haruka and Nao were giving her encouraging applause. Natsuki 
finally joined in as well when she broke out of her daze.</p><p>Trying to suppress a blush 
at the overwhelming reaction, Shizuru gave a thankful bow before moving offstage. She 
returned to the changing room to put her own clothes back on, and then rejoined the group, 
taking back her seat by Natsuki. She wasted no time in slipping her left arm back around 
Natsuki’s shoulders and pulling the girl into her, prompting a barely-restrained giggle from 
her.</p><p>“Alright, last round of drinks is ready, if you can free your hands, Fujino-san,” 
Nao had snuck up while Shizuru was distracted with Natsuki, carrying a tray of paper cups 
filled with what looked like fruit punch. Shizuru reached out to take one with her free 
hand, but Nao snatched the one she was going for away from her and pushed it on Natsuki. 
“Here you go, Kuga. Drink up.”</p><p>Natsuki accepted the drink with a shrug, but Shizuru’s 
suspicions flared up as she took another cup from the tray. There was certainly no love lost 
between the two girls, and Nao might have been a bit peeved that Natsuki didn’t have to sing 
tonight. It also seemed to be just her style to spike Natsuki’s drink, most likely with a 
laxative or something else embarrassing. That was certainly not what she needed tonight, and 
Shizuru vowed to make Nao’s life a living hell if it turned out to be the case, forgiveness 
and reparations be damned.</p><p>“Wait a second, Natsuki,” Shizuru said softly after Nao had 
turned away, grasping Natsuki’s arm to stop her from drinking. Better to be safe than sorry. 
“Let me check something.”</p><p>Natsuki gave a shrug and placed her drink down as Shizuru 
got up and approached Mai. She took the girl over to a corner for a somewhat private 
conversation. “Tokiha-san,” she said. “Did you see Nao-san pour the drinks? She was acting 
somewhat oddly in handing one to Natsuki.”</p><p>Mai’s brow furrowed and she shook her head 
slightly. “Don’t worry, I saw her pour them. She didn’t slip anything into any of them. How 
was she acting oddly anyways?”</p><p>“Oh, just grabbing a cup away from me and giving it to 
Natsuki,” Shizuru said.</p><p>“Heh, well I wouldn’t worry about that,” Mai said, a smile 
creeping across her face. “Nao-san probably just had it on her mind to be a little nice to 
Natsuki. She’s still not the most socially-adept person, but I think she’s making an effort 
to make amends as best as she can. Don’t worry so much, okay?”</p><p>Shizuru let out a 
relieved chuckle. <i>I guess I’m not the only one trying to make things right now. Sorry, 
Nao-san.</i> “Alright, thank you, Mai-san,” she said, figuring it was about time she dropped 
a bit of the formalities with the girl. She was Natsuki’s other best friend, after 
all.</p><p>“No problem… Shizuru-san,” Mai replied. She gave a smile to make up for her 
hesitance, and then headed out to rejoin the group.</p><p>Shizuru followed Mai back, and 
retook her seat by Natsuki. “So is it safe to drink?” Natsuki asked her 
half-jokingly.</p><p>“Yes, you may go right ahead,” Shizuru said, patting Natsuki’s 
leg.</p><p>Natsuki smiled at her and took a sip. She then used her free hand to grab a hold 
of Shizuru’s hand from her leg and wrapped it back around her shoulders, moving back in to 
press up against the now-blushing Shizuru. “You make a good pillow, you know that?” Natsuki 
said.</p><p>“Ara, does this mean that, like a pillow, Natsuki wishes to sleep with me?” 
Shizuru teased, in part to get back at Natsuki for the blush she’d just suffered.</p><p>Her 
tactic didn’t work, though. The response it garnered was instead Natsuki turning her head to 
whisper into Shizuru’s ear, “I think you’ll find out soon enough.”</p><p>Shizuru felt her 
face turn beet red. <i>I see you’re learning how to tease quite well yourself, Natsuki. But 
I’m still the master, and as long as I am, you can expect to pay back double for such 
insolence. Just wait until you see what I’ve got planned for you after 
this.</i></p><hr>“Okay, if we’re here, can I take the blindfold off now, Shizuru?” Natsuki 
asked.</p><p>Shizuru let out a light chuckle. “Not quite yet. There’s one little thing I 
have to do first.”</p><p>“Alright, go ahead.” Natsuki sighed, and she probably also rolled 
her eyes behind the blindfold.</p><p>“Okay, remember when you teased me about sleeping with 
me earlier? Well, it’s time for you to pay for that now,” Shizuru said, sidestepping behind 
Natsuki and bringing her hands into place for her attack.</p><p>“Hey, you were the one who 
brought that subject up! Don’t dish it out if you can’t ta- oh…” Natsuki trailed off into a 
moan as Shizuru’s hand found its target, pressing in once more on the sensitive spot above 
her right hip. Shizuru’s other arm wrapped around Natsuki’s chest and pulled her back, 
making her body press up against Shizuru’s. Shizuru then pressed her chest out to make sure 
Natsuki knew exactly which parts of her physique were pressed up against her – though 
Shizuru definitely wasn’t complaining about the sparks that ran through her at the 
contact.</p><p>Natsuki’s breath had quickened, and she started panting as Shizuru pressed in 
harder and started to massage what she had started to think of as Natsuki’s “pleasure 
button.” Before long, Shizuru felt an additional weight against her, and realized that 
Natsuki’s legs had weakened. Natsuki was crumbling in her arms. She could have taken her 
right there, and probably not face any resistance. But it wasn’t right, she had to be ready 
on her own. It would be wrong to push her into this, especially when there was so much left 
to do that night.</p><p>Reluctantly, Shizuru removed her hand from Natsuki’s side and 
brought it up to help support the girl as she caught her breath and regained her strength. 
As she did so, eventually Natsuki regained enough coherence of thought to pant out, “I still 
say that’s not fair.”</p><p>“Hmm, well my offer to let you search for my own sensitive spot 
still stands,” Shizuru murmured. Her mind drifted off to a fantasy of Natsuki doing just 
that as a wave of warmth filled her chest.</p><p>“I may have to take you up on that,” 
Natsuki said, and the warmth promptly spread to Shizuru’s face. <i>Damn you, Natsuki. I’m 
never going to get even at this rate! As much as it hurts my pride to admit, I guess you’ve 
won for tonight; I can’t push you any further without really being unfair. Time for your 
reward, then, I guess.</i></p><p>“For now, I think you can just take off the blindfold,” 
Shizuru said, releasing Natsuki from her grasp so the girl had room to maneuver her arms 
around. She stepped around in front of Natsuki and spread her arms as the blindfold was 
removed. “Ta-da!”</p><p>Natsuki’s eyes widened in surprise, then sunk into an expression of 
desire. “W-What is this?”</p><p>“Well… I was thinking, and I remembered another time I hurt 
you. When that lingerie-stealing Orphan attacked, it was my plan which cost you your entire 
collection. So…” Shizuru swept her arms across the room, pointing out the racks of lingerie 
spread around the store, “I’m going to help you top it off now with some of the best. Choose 
any five outfits you want, and they’re all on me. Price is absolutely no 
problem.”</p><p>Natsuki’s eyes lit up like a kid in a candy store, and she darted past 
Shizuru to the back of the store, where the expensive, designer pieces were kept. A broad 
smile spread across Shizuru’s face at seeing Natsuki so excited. <i>Working here sure does 
come in handy sometimes. And this time, I’m not going to be left with any regrets of taking 
advantage of her.</i></p><p>Shizuru’s mind drifted back to her first trip to the this store 
with Natsuki. For a while, she’d thought of it as one of the happiest moments of her life. 
When Natsuki finally knocked some sense into her, though, it became one of the moments she 
most regretted. She’d taken advantage of her friend, and used helping her try on bras as an 
excuse to grope her breasts, almost bringing her to the point of orgasm when she’d also 
lucked onto finding out how sensitive Natsuki’s HiME mark was.</p><p>Shizuru shook her head. 
That was all in the past now. Natsuki no longer recoiled from her touch, and it wouldn’t be 
long at all before she’d seek it out herself. She’d given the girl a coupon for that 
particular incident, and hopefully Natsuki would find a good use for it so Shizuru could 
finally stop regretting what she’d done. Until that time, doing this favor for her friend 
tonight would at least serve to create some better memories for this store.</p><p>“Hey, 
Shizuru!” Natsuki yelled out from the changing room, drawing Shizuru from her thoughts. 
“What’s up with these import bras? All the sizes seem to be off.”</p><p>Shizuru walked 
towards the changing room so she wouldn’t have to yell in response. “Are those the European 
ones you’re trying, Natsuki?” she said as she approached the curtain to the changing room 
she’d heard Natsuki yell from.</p><p>“Yeah, what’s up with them?” Natsuki yelled from behind 
the curtain.</p><p>“The European Union recently set a new standard for clothing sizes to try 
to make things more consistent. This means that all their bra sizes are a bit different 
now.”</p><p>“Oh,” Natsuki paused for a moment. “Um, could you maybe help me figure out what 
would fit then?”</p><p>Yet another blush filled Shizuru’s cheeks. <i>Ara ara, Natsuki, are 
you actually asking me to feel you up? You just have to rub in your teasing victory for 
tonight, don’t you?</i></p><p>“Shizuru?” Natsuki said again after Shizuru’s pause. “It would 
be a lot easier than messing around with every size to figure out what fits.”</p><p>Shizuru 
let out a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding. Of course, Natsuk’s mind wasn’t as 
dirty as hers was. She really just meant what she’d said. She’d let her imagination get away 
from her there. Still, it was nice to see that Natsuki was trusting her not to take 
advantage of her again. “Of course, Natsuki. Is it alright if I come in?”</p><p>“Yeah, 
sure,” Natsuki said.</p><p>Shizuru moved the curtain aside and slipped into the room, trying 
not to let her eyesight focus on Natsuki’s bra-clad chest and not to let her mind start to 
focus on what it was going to feel like when she was able to- No, she was trying <i>not</i> 
to think about that. “Um, could you turn around, Natsuki? It’s easier to get a good feel, 
er, measurement that way.”</p><p>Natsuki let out a light chuckle as she turned. “Feel away, 
Shizuru,” she said. “You don’t have to be so uncomfortable.”</p><p><i>How are you ever 
holding yourself together so well tonight, Natsuki? You’re supposed to be the hesitant and 
shy one here.</i> Tentatively, Shizuru wrapped her hands around Natsuki’s rib cage, just 
under the swell of her breasts. She tried not to think about the fact that she was touching 
Natsuki’s bare flesh near such an intimate area, but it was no good. <i>Ara, I’m sorry 
Natsuki, but I’m going to have to let myself enjoy this a little or I’ll go 
crazy.</i></p><p>Shizuru let herself drift off to a bit of a dream-world as she felt around 
under Natsuki’s breasts. “Let’s see… 73, 74 centimeters, I think. Okay, now for the overbust 
size,” she said to give Natsuki a little warning as she let her hands drift up over 
Natsuki’s breasts, desperately fighting the urge to squeeze her hands and start massaging 
them as she’d done the last time she was in this position.</p><p>“The new European sizes use 
the maximum size when you breathe in, so breathe deeply for me, Natsuki,” Shizuru said. She 
almost jerked her hands away as the bulging of Natsuki’s chest pushed her breasts into them, 
but she was able to control herself and keep them just lightly touching. “Ara ara, Natsuki 
is certainly fit with such a large lung capacity,” she said as Natsuki’s chest came to a 
stop. “Let’s see, that’s a good 94 or 95, I think.”</p><p>“I’m a 95?” Natsuki said in 
surprise. “I think I like this new system.”</p><p>Shizuru giggled lightly as she reluctantly 
withdrew her hands from Natsuki’s breasts. “I think you’ll like this next part even more. 
Your large lung capacity brings you up to a D-cup now.”</p><p>“Ooh, I definitely like this 
new system,” Natsuki said, turning around to face Shizuru again. A large smile was plastered 
across her face, and there was just a hint of a blush on her cheeks.</p><p>Shizuru’s gaze 
had ended up on Natsuki’s breasts as the girl turned, but she quickly pulled it away. “Let 
me see, what brands were you trying… okay, let me go get you some 74Ds.”</p><p>Shizuru 
reluctantly parted from Natsuki and went out to collect the bras she was looking for. She 
also took this as a chance to try to calm down her heart, which had taken to racing at the 
sight and feel of Natsuki in just a bra. <i>Damn it, why was I able to handle myself so much 
better when I was taking advantage of her? This should be easier now.</i></p><p>Heat swelled 
through Shizuru’s heart as an explanation occurred to her: the difference was that now, she 
truly cared about Natsuki and what she thought. She wasn’t just doing this for her own 
selfish pleasure anymore. <i>Forgive me, Natsuki, I was a fool back then. That wasn’t really 
love, I think, just desire. But it’s love now, I know. Maybe I’m finally worthy to receive 
your affections.</i></p><p>Shizuru let a smile creep across her face at this thought. This 
was turning out to be quite the evening. Not only was she finally going to officially get 
Natsuki’s answer, but she’d come to an important realization about her own feelings as well. 
It was with this smile on her face that she returned to Natsuki in the changing room and 
gave her the bras.</p><p>Natsuki thanked her for the bras, and then spent a minute staring 
at Shizuru, who was still lost in dreamland. “Shizuru?” Natsuki said after a 
bit.</p><p>“Hmm?” Shizuru said, shaking herself out of the haze.</p><p>“Mind letting me 
change?”</p><p>“Not at all,” Shizuru said, finding herself drawn back into Natsuki’s 
eyes.</p><p>“Mind letting me change <i>alone</i>?”</p><p>“Oh! Oh, of course. Forgive me, but 
Natsuki can be very distracting,” Shizuru said, a light blush forming in her cheeks. She 
quickly turned away and snuck past the curtain to hide it from Natsuki.</p><p>It didn’t take 
long for Natsuki to pick out some bras she liked, along with matching panties. She also 
ended up getting a chemise and – to Shizuru’s surprise and embarrassment – a teddy. “Ara, is 
Natsuki planning to seduce me?” Shizuru asked as Natsuki put the teddy on the counter near 
the cash register.</p><p>Unfortunately, even this comment failed to make Natsuki blush. 
“You’ll see,” was all she said, with a devious grin she could have easily stolen from 
Shizuru on her face. Shizuru was barely able to restrain the blush this time, and she 
proceeded to check out the items for Natsuki, putting them on her own credit card. It ran up 
to quite a tab, but she wasn’t exactly stretched for cash, and Natsuki was worth it in any 
case.</p><p>After packaging up Natsuki’s purchases, she led the girl back to her car. “So, 
are you ready for this night to end?” she asked. She knew Natsuki wasn’t done yet, but she 
wanted to give the girl the chance to choose what to do from here.</p><p>“Heh, not quite 
yet,” Natsuki said, the devious grin back on her face. “Let’s go to my place now. I’ve got a 
little surprise of my own for you.”</p>
