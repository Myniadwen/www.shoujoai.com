<p>Fueling the  Fire</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I stood on the back  edge of the currently stationary cruiser, the salty seawater smell  consuming my nostrils, the wind playing with my dark hair. I silently  watched the tremulous waves stir, their steady pulse lapping clearly  in my ears. Two hours had passed since I had met Yamada and his  fellow informant confidant at one of the local boat rentals. We had  quickly purchased their fastest speeder, with my money of course, and  immediately we set out to sea to find the girl I had knocked off the  bridge. We had been searching all this time with no luck at all. When  we first arrived at the area where Mingai had plummeted and she was  nowhere to be seen, I ordered that we search the surrounding area. We  drove around for a good half hour with no sign of her. Yamada  suggested that maybe she had fallen unconscious and drowned, but I  knew better. This girl was a Hime after all. She wasn’t going to  die that easily…I certainly wouldn’t.
<p>We  returned to the previous spot and proceeded to wait, hoping for some  sign of the girl. I took this time to mend the gash she had put in my  arm right above my left elbow. I wasn’t too concerned with it, I  mean, it would heal in no time, but that wasn’t exactly the same  for my pride. I had let this puny little girl get the better of me,  and for that I wasn’t about to let her go so easily. That and the  fact that this whole mission <em>was</em> to prevent her from reaching the school.</p>
<p>At the sound of the  door opening behind me, I turned to see Yamada stepping out of the  cabin, a slightly grim look upon his face, “That girl, she probably  got picked up by the ferry.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“There’s a ferry  that travels between here and the mainland. It passes right under  this very bridge. I bet they found her before we got here.”</p>
<p>“That so…?”</p>
<p>Leaving my station, I  slipped through the small door behind Yamada, both of us sitting down  on the benches that lined either side of the interior of the dimly  lit boat. The man whipped out a map, laying it across his lap before  tracing a specific route with his finger, “We picked up the ferry’s  signal on the radio. It seems this is their path. It’s currently  around this area I presume.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“So? What’s the  plan?”</p>
<p>“…Do you really  have to ask?” I questioned, pulling my leather suit up and back  over my shoulders.</p>
<p>Yamada smirked at my  words before standing and making his way to the front of the boat  where his partner was currently at the controls. I could hear the  mumbling of his deep voice before the speeder jolted, taking off at  full speed.</p>
<p><em>Let the hunt begin.</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I see it, it’s  over there. You just worry about getting on board, we’ll jam their  communications as long as we can.”
<p>Yamada’s words broke  me from my deep concentration as I sat in the back of the boat,  suited up and ready to go. I turned my head in his direction, nodding  to his back as I stood and proceeded to make my way back outside into  the cool evening air. I had just gripped the handle with when he  called out to me.</p>
<p>“Kuga!”</p>
<p>I glanced back over my  shoulder, remaining silent as I opened the door.</p>
<p>“…Good luck.”</p>
<p>“Like I really need  it,” I confidently replied, stepping out and hastily shutting the  door behind me.</p>
<p>Once outside I closed  my eyes, “Duran!”</p>
<p>The temperature around  me seemed to drop as there was a burst of light followed by the  cracking of forming ice before the magnificent child emerged with a  howl. He immediately crouched down, allowing me to straddle his cool  metal frame.</p>
<p>“Ready?” I  questioned the wolf while giving him a hefty pat on the neck with my  gloved hand.</p>
<p>Duran voiced his  understanding with a low guttural noise.</p>
<p>We patiently waited  until Yamada and his counterpart had maneuvered us close enough to  the ferry before Duran sprung off the boat with one powerful leap,  not even having to wait for my command. The two of us glided  weightlessly through the air before my child expertly landed on the  roof of the ferry with only a small clatter of metal against metal. I  was quick to jump off his back.</p>
<p>“Disperse for now,  I’ll call you if necessary,” I told the creature who instantly  obeyed.</p>
<p>I ran over to the side  of the ferry, gazing down at the dark water below, skimming over the  boat’s exterior for a way inside. On the way up I had noticed a row  of windows and I could see their slight overhang from where I stood  now. From below I could hear the slight murmur of voices…two to be  precise: one male, one female. Using this to my advantage, I lined  myself up roughly around where I though they were coming from, and in  dramatic movie fashion, I stepped over the ledge.</p>
<p>Free falling is a very  strange feeling. It’s complete unrestrained freedom, something that  I value very greatly, but it is also absolutely horrifying. Being out  of control like that, utterly helpless as the wind violently whips  around your body, it really gives you the perspective of how very  fragile we are.</p>
<p>Luckily for me,  however, I had three very optimistic outcomes to my course of action.  One: I could simply fall into the ocean below. Sure, it would sting,  but I certainly wasn’t going to die from it. Two: I could easily  call Duran to come snatch me out of the air and land me somewhere  safe. And then there was option number three…the one that I  ultimately took.</p>
<p>Quickly twisting my  body to face the side of the ferry as I fell, I stretched out my  arms, barely catching the overhang of the window with my fingertips,  just enough to use my downward propulsion to slingshot myself inside  the vessel. Once I land, more gracefully than I had expected to be  perfectly honest, I found the source of the voices I had heard  earlier. Taking a millisecond to process the situation, I quickly  sent a knee to the male’s midsection before following up with a  downward double fisted swing to his back. Ignoring the now  unconscious body at my feet, I turned to the female he had been  speaking with moments before. Her pale violet eyes looked at me with  both confusion and horror, which only become intensifies as I took a  step forward. She backed up instinctively before finally collecting  her wits and trying to bolt down the hall. She was no match for my  speed of course, and I quickly grabbed her arm, twisting it behind  her back as I pressed my free arm against her neck, stopping her dead  in her tracks. Oddly enough she didn’t struggle…or maybe I really  had just become that strong, who knows.</p>
<p>“You should have  picked up a girl with a sword. Where is she?”</p>
<p>The redhead tried to  respond, but it only came out as a whimper, and in turn I loosened my  grip slightly.</p>
<p>“Relief…room…”  she managed to croak out on the second attempt. Releasing her, I gave  the girl a shove causing her to yelp in surprise as she stumbled  forward.</p>
<p>“Take me there,” I  ordered, “…And you’d better not try anything funny.”</p>
<p>The violet-eyed girl  silently complied as she began to trudge down the narrow hallway.</p>
<p>Eventually we did make  it to the room she spoke of and I gave her another violent shove,  this time into the door causing her to cry out at the initial contact  before sliding down to the floor onto her knees.</p>
<p>“…What are you  thinking of doing?” she dared to ask me, trying to sound brave  despite the look of fear still present in her eyes.</p>
<p><em>Just get out of the  way.</em></p>
<p>With my gloved hand I  pushed her fiery orange-haired head down causing her to scream yet  again. As she cowered in front of me, I summoned both guns, preparing  for the upcoming battle with the Hime on the other side of the wall.  The busty girl was at least smart enough to duck when I sent a  powerful roundhouse kick to the door, knocking the thing off of his  hinges and onto the floor. I quickly made my way inside, stepping  over the redhead who was now curled into a ball on the ground. I  whipped out both guns, pointing them straight ahead of me, but found  nothing but an empty room answering me back.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>A familiar grunt from  behind, followed by a gasp from the violet-eyed girl jerked me around  just in time to see Minagi lunging at me from the ceiling, sword in  hand. I jumped out of the way of the deadly strike, but the floor  wasn’t so lucky, and it immediately crumbled, all three of us  falling to the car garage below in a heap of debris and dust. I  noticed Minagi’s differently attired form roll across the floor,  and I was quick to place a foot on her blade, shoving my pistol into  her forehead before she can recover.</p>
<p>“Seriously…” I  began, giving her skull a nice push with my revolver, “What a  trouble-maker you are.”</p>
<p>I kept my gun and my  gaze steady even as my helmet shattered, breaking into two pieces  before falling to the floor and releasing my midnight colored locks  in the process.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you  understand that they’re just taking advantage of you? We can’t  allow them to gather us up anymore…Hime to that land of Fuuka.”</p>
<p>Apparently the girl was  still in no mood to talk as she lashed out at me with an attempted  heel to the face. She was nearly successful, but I pulled out a  backhand spring to dodge the assault.</p>
<p>“Quit it!” I  persisted.</p>
<p>It was no use as the  girl began to swing the large blade in a circle around her, but  rather than plummet the thing into the ground like the last time, she  just continued the strike, taking out the top half of a truck  trailer, and nearly the violet eyed girl’s head, in the process. I  dropped to my stomach, sliding several feet away from her, to avoid  the blow.</p>
<p>I was quick to my feet,  “Not worth interrogating, eh? Then I’ll go all out too…Duran!”</p>
<p>The silver wolf  appeared at my command in his usual fashion.</p>
<p>“Go!”</p>
<p>Duran took off, and  when the small girl attempted to swipe at him with her blade, he  easily dodged, grabbed the sword in his mouth, and effortlessly flung  her across the room. Before she could react, he followed up with a  volley of cannon fire, disregarding the vehicles and structuring  around us. Suddenly, one of the trucks exploded, an eruption of fire  blazing from where it  had previously stood. The sprinklers  immediately set off along with an alarm, and I was quick to sprint  off towards the nearest exit, Duran close behind.</p>
<p><em>Shit! No way I want  to leave her, but we’d better head out before security comes. Maybe  she’ll follow me out.</em></p>
<p>“Duran! To the roof,”  I yelled, jumping onto my child’s back as we ran. Once I was on  board, he took off even faster than before, easily maneuvering his  way to the top of the ferry.</p>
<p>We were greeted by a  blast of cool air as Duran landed. I immediately dismounted, scanning  all around me for any sign of the dark haired girl.</p>
<p><em>Where could she  have—</em></p>
<p>Before I can even  finish the thought, she appeared, charging straight at me, aiming to  cut me in half. With all the strength I could muster in my legs, I  back flipped away, Duran switching places with me to greet her head  on. The two do just that, the silver wolf pouncing at the last second  just for his underbelly to be met with the edge of Minagi’s blade.  This hardly stuns him, however, as he quickly recovers to knock the  girl back to the ground before she can attack again. This also places  her perfectly and helplessly at my feet, especially considering that  she lost her grip on her sword in Duran’s last hit.</p>
<p>I promptly placed the  head of my gun into her skull once again, “This is your last  chance. Depart from this land.”</p>
<p>She silent glared up at  me, hatred steaming in those golden orbs, before she suddenly grabbed  a hunk of my hair in her fist with lightning fast agility. I let out  a scream as she tossed me aside, immediately jumping back to retrieve  her weapon. I quickly recovered, but somehow in the process the girl  managed to wrap a section of my own hair around my right arm, and  when I go to point my pistol at her, I inevitable rip them out in the  process.</p>
<p><em>Damn it! She’s  bested me twice now! </em></p>
<p>“Duran!”</p>
<p>The beast is by my side  in a second.</p>
<p>“Load Silver  Cartridge.”</p>
<p>The turning of gears,  the sliding of metal against metal.</p>
<p>“Fire!”</p>
<p>A loud blast, followed  by the crackling of ice crystal’s being formed. They fly through  the air just a quickly as a bullet.</p>
<p>In defense, the dark  haired Hime summoned a wall of stone, effectively blocking Duran’s  attack, but at the same time, it also cut the ship through and  through, leaving it in two separate halves. It arrived in a flash,  and disappeared just as quickly and brightly. I fell to the ground,  unable to keep my balance as I hear Duran shoot off another round.  Minagi’s shout followed as she disappeared from my view, falling to  the lower level of the roof. The silver wolf quickly prowled after  her, and once I was back on my feet, I follow, making it just in time  to see something totally unexpected.</p>
<p>The girl from before,  the busty redhead, miraculously summoned a shield of fire around her  and Minagi’s seemingly unconscious form, effectively warding off  Duran’s lunging strike.</p>
<p>I watch as my child  flew backward, rolling several times before coming to a rest on his  side.</p>
<p>“Duran?!”</p>
<p>Turning my attention  away from my child, I stared at the girl who was kneeling with her  eyes closed, her arms still stretched out, “That’s…”</p>
<p><em>No way…don’t  tell me that…she’s a Hime too…</em></p>
<p>“Hey!” I yelled out  to her, catching her attention just moments before I took a shot at  her. She instinctively shielded herself again; the fiery boundary  surrounding her once more proving my thought to be true.</p>
<p>“So that’s the  deal. You see that star too.”</p>
<p>The girl looked at me  rather perplexed, not entirely sure of what I was talking about.</p>
<p>Ignoring her, a  previous conversation with Sakomizu came to mind only causing my  blood to boil, “That liar. So it’s as they planed after all…”</p>
<p><em>It’s too late for  that now. I don’t have the time to worry about that damn afro  snitch, all I can do is try to warn this girl who’s obviously  transferring to Fuuka as well.</em></p>
<p>“Hey, you!” I  continued, “This is a warning. Don’t go to Fuuka Academy. If you  do, you’ll die.”</p>
<p>Walking away, Duran was  right behind me a moment later, the two of us hurriedly returning to  the rented speeder so we won’t find ourselves swimming with the  fishes at the bottom of the ocean with the doomed cruiser. Duran  disappeared as I barged inside the cabin, sitting down with an  agitated huff.</p>
<p>“So, uh…how did it  go?” Yamada sheepishly questioned me.</p>
<p>I simply replied with an icy glare so cold that hell would have froze  over.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
When I finally made it  back to my apartment at god only knows what time in the morning, I  left the lights off, pacing back and forth in the darkness as my  thoughts streamed through my head at one hundred miles per hour.
<p><em>Great. That went  just great. There were two of them. Two! Sakomizu didn’t say that</em><em><strong>two</strong></em><em> were coming. He didn’t say a lot of things  actually...damn fat ass…And I bet both of those girls won’t  listen to me at all. I’m sure they’ll be there at school in a few  days if not tomorrow. I guess that means I’ll actually have to  go…God! I can’t believe that two of them slipped through my  hands!</em></p>
<p>I violently ripped the  glove off of my right hand and proceed to throw it into the wall as  hard as I possibly could. The left one was quick to follow.</p>
<p>Stripping down the rest  of the way, I jumped into the shower, letting the warm water rush  over my exhausted body.</p>
<p><em>If they show up at  the school, I’m definitely going to have to talk to them. Just  another troublesome task…but it has to be done. I’m the only one  who knows the truth...or at least </em><em><strong>some</strong></em><em> of it.  Maybe I should tell them as well…I wonder if they would help  any…eh…God, I don’t know what to do…</em></p>
<p>Once I finished my  shower, changed into my pajamas, and brushed my teeth, I finally  collapsed onto my bed. With my last ounce of energy, I turned my gaze  to the clock.</p>
<p><em>4:37…That’s  like…three and a half hours of sleep…</em></p>
<p>I rolled back over onto  my other side as I shut my eyes, blocking out the first rays of  daylight already shining through the window.</p>
<p><em>Who am I kidding?  Like I haven’t slept in before…</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
When I did manage to crawl out of bed later that day, I hastily  slipped back into my biker suit, grabbed my spare helmet from the  back of the closet, snatched up my school uniform that was in a heap  on the floor, and trotted out the door. Once I arrived at school,  parking my bike in it’s usual hiding spot, I quickly changed into  my uniform and took off towards the school.
<p>The only bad thing about arriving on the school grounds around  lunchtime was the fact that a majority of the students were outside  eating and conversing. Of course, when I came storming though most of  their attention was averted to my general direction. My tunnel vision  prevented me from scaring the gazes away, for once allowing the males  at the academy to ogle at me without paying for it two seconds later.  I was on a mission, and nothing was going to get in my away from  getting to my current destination. I knew <em>he </em>would be there  now. He always spent the lunch break tending to his stupid flowers…</p>
<p>“It’s hard to appreciate a rough job,” Sakomizu began before I  could even lean back against my usual tree, “Taking care of  everything afterwards was such a pain; although, people in  Headquarters may be pleased to have a job to work on.”</p>
<p>“You knew all along, didn’t you? That another one was coming in  on that ferry,” I accused him outright.</p>
<p>“It seems like that was the case. I was surprised when I heard it  this morning,” came his whimsical reply.</p>
<p>“…What a liar,” I snapped back.</p>
<p>Too fed up with him to talk at the moment, I stormed off back to the  front of the school. I dug my phone out of my pocket on the way to  check the time.</p>
<p><em>Hmm. Class hasn’t started yet…I guess I might as well go while  I’m here.</em></p>
<p>I did, in fact, go to all of my remaining classes for the day, but I  really didn’t pay attention, simply staring at the window as my  mind recounted the previous nights events over and over again.</p>
<p><em>Who was that other girl, I wonder…She obviously hasn’t  awakened quite yet, I mean, she looked just as shocked as I did when  she formed that barrier…I wonder if the two of them made it or  not…Minagi I’m not so concerned about, but the redhead…</em></p>
<p>The sound of the last bell of the day disrupted my inner ramblings as  the familiar chatter of my classmates soon filled my ears. Still in  my own little world, I unconsciously took myself outside, and when I  finally came to, I was at my usual tree out front.</p>
<p><em>Maybe I’ll stick around for a bit…in case either of those  girls decides to show up. </em></p>
<p>I hung around for a good hour or so, the setting sun casting the sky  into hues of red and orange, but apparently staying for no good  reason as neither Minagi nor the redhead made an appearance. At the  sound of the student council being let out, I hissed. Not wanting to  be caught, more like questioned, for loitering around the school  after hours, particularly by a specific burgundy-eyed Kyoto native, I  quickly snuck away without being seen, sprinting the rest of the way  to my motorcycle once the coast was clear. Once there, I changed back  into my leather suit, silently thanking the trees for the privacy  they provided.</p>
<p>I had just finished changing and was about to put on my helmet when I  heard a rustling in front of me, and when I looked up, I met familiar  violet eyes. I couldn’t prevent the nearly inaudible gasp from  passing my lips.</p>
<p>“Seems you didn’t drown,” I remarked, regaining my nonchalant  attitude. The girl didn’t seem to appreciate this at all.</p>
<p>“What are you? Coming to the Academy like nothing happened after  doing all that,” she rapidly rambled off, obviously indicating the  events that had taken place on the ferry. “If I speak to the  police…” she continued, but I was quick to cut her off.</p>
<p>“The police can’t do anything against the force that stirs behind  this Academy.”</p>
<p>“You’ll find out soon enough…my dear princess,” a light,  hauntingly cheery voice piped in, and I knew immediately who it is.</p>
<p>“Nagi!” I proclaimed, summoning my element in my free hand.</p>
<p>“Again…What are you?” the redhead demanded.</p>
<p><em>She’s going to find out sooner or later…</em></p>
<p>My eyes shifted to gaze at her,“I’m a Hime.”</p>
<p>“Hime?”</p>
<p>“The power to materialize photons. That’s what guys from the  First District call it.”</p>
<p>“First District?”</p>
<p>“Lectures are good,” Nagi interrupted again, “but I get a  feeling that something awful might happen.”</p>
<p>My tone deepened on it’s own, most likely out of my distrust for  the strange boy, “Meaning?”</p>
<p>“A poor, lost child is here.”</p>
<p>“Orphan?!” I exclaimed.</p>
<p><em>Not </em><em><strong>another</strong></em><em> one…</em></p>
<p>“Mai-chan,” the pale haired boy sung, choosing to ignore me for  the moment. I watch as he tossed the girl a white container that  rattled when it hit her hands, “I think you, especially, should  hurry.”</p>
<p>Nagi disappeared in his usual devious fashion as the redhead in front  of me stared down at the case in her hands, a petrified look in her  eyes. Choosing not to just wait around while an Orphan was rampaging  around campus, I settled myself on my bike and started the engine.  This snapped the girl out of her daze as she instantly jumped in  front of me, arms outstretched, blocking me from advancing.</p>
<p>“Move.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Move!”</p>
<p>“NO!”</p>
<p>My eyes narrowed behind the tented plastic of my visor.</p>
<p><em>Persistent, aren’t we…</em></p>
<p>Coming to a quick conclusion, I motioned behind me with my head, “Get  on.”</p>
<p>Although looking rather shocked at first, the girl was quick to  comply. The only other person who had ever rode on my bike with me  was Shizuru, so needless to say it was a little weird having a  complete stranger tag along with me, not to mention having their arms  wrapped tightly around my midsection.</p>
<p>I revved the engine again before glancing back over my shoulder,  “Hold on.”</p>
<p>The girl simply nodded, tightening her grip around my waist before we  took off through the woods.</p>
<p>It wasn’t too long before I spotted I hole in the mountain side, my  intuition screaming at me to venture in further. I followed my  instincts and, low and behold, we happened upon a giant monstrous  insect that’s back was currently turned towards us, apparently  preoccupied with the motionless body at its feet. Throwing off my  helmet, I summoned my pistol once again, rapidly firing off several  ice blasts at the thing to get its attention. The creature did indeed  look at its new visitors, prey more like it, but my own attention was  soon averted to the screaming girl behind me on the bike.</p>
<p>“Takumi! His heart!” she yelled, taking off towards the boy lying  unconscious on the ground.</p>
<p>“When she’s not awake yet…!”</p>
<p><em>Dammit, she’s crazy! I guess it’s up to me then.</em></p>
<p>“Duran! Go!” I called upon my child once again, the silver wolf  lunging for the Orphan’s head without delay. When he was thrown  back to the ground, easily landing on all fours, I was  instantaneously at his side. Although we tried to keep the thing  busy, the creature was obviously more interested in the ones not  currently trying to cause it harm, and it began assaulting the girl  who was desperately trying to wake the boy.</p>
<p>“Behind you!” I called out to her, and luckily my warning gave  her just enough time to pull the two of them out of the way.</p>
<p>Right when the monster went to make another strike, I saw the redhead  defensively position herself between the thing and the boy behind  her. I instantly knew what she was thinking.</p>
<p>“Move, you can’t do it,” I warned her, but she obviously proved  me wrong as a pillar of fire erupted around her, reaching up to the  sky.</p>
<p>I stood motionless and in complete shock as I witnessed golden rings  materialize around all four of her limbs, one to each wrist and one  to each ankle.</p>
<p>“That girl…” I managed to mutter, still stunned by what I’d  just seen, but I quickly regained my senses when I noticed movement  from the Orphan, “Hey!”</p>
<p>Before I could even shoot, the girl formed a wave of flame, scorching  the insect creature, along with part of the mountainside, with a  clumsy fiery blast. She stared on in awe, not entirely knowing what  to think of the glowing rings and what she had just done, when Nagi’s  voice reached her and my ears once again, spouting out the same  information that he told me when I first awakened.</p>
<p>“Nagi!” I attempted to cut him off, but it really wasn’t any  use as the redhead once again was forced to dodge the monster’s  attack. I watched on in complete amazement as the battle continued,  and I was even more mesmerized when I saw Minagi Mikoto fall from the  sky, assaulting the Orphan from above before inevitably cutting it in  half.</p>
<p>I saw the two girls converse after the thing was presumably dead, but  I was quick to cut their talking short, “You guys! Leave it there.  I’ve told you two not to get involved.”</p>
<p>I could plainly see Minagi glare at me with her golden eyes filled  with hate, but before anything became of it, Nagi began preaching  again, “That’s right. It’s too early for that, you two.”</p>
<p>Suddenly the Orphan sprung to life again, flying up into the air  before spinning into a ball and flying directly at me and my child.  Luckily Duran and I both managed to avoid the blow. Mikoto attempted  to fight back, but failed, however, her attempted assault gave me the  time to recover and prepare a counterattack.</p>
<p>“Duran! Load Chrome Cartridge…Fire!”</p>
<p>The shot was dead on, two holes piercing through the monster’s  body, but he still didn’t fall.</p>
<p>“A tough guy…”</p>
<p>I noticed that the bottom half of the Orphan resurrected as well, but  I was far too preoccupied with the half that was currently trying to  back me into a wall. Both Minagi and I, along with Duran, continue to  strike the thing, but nothing seems to slow it down. When Duran  managed to buy us a few seconds, my keen ears pick up on Nagi’s  childish voice speaking to the redhead about her child.</p>
<p>“Don’t,” I called out before sending a few shots in the pest’s  direction. “Don’t listen to what he says.”</p>
<p>Before I could continue my warning, the monster from before lashed  out once again, slamming his claws into the ground where I had  previously just stood. I recovered just in time to hear Nagi coax the  violet-eyed girl even further.</p>
<p>“Don’t!” I persistently tried one last time, but once again  found myself dodging the Orphan’s attack. The next thing that I  knew, the entire cave was engulfed in bright light.</p>
<p>“That idiot,” I declared as I watch a wall of flames appear  before me, the intensity of the flames burning my skin. I couldn’t  even move when I saw the giant white dragon emerge from within, my  mouth hanging agape.</p>
<p><em>My god…how is it…so huge…?!</em></p>
<p>The newborn child opened its mouth, releasing a cloud of steam, and I  jerked at the realization of what was soon to follow.</p>
<p>“Duran!” I frantically called out, my feet taking over as I  sprinted from the cave. My child was not the only one to follow close  on my heels; we were also accompanied by Minagi Mikoto who was also  too far concerned with her own self-preservation than to start a  fight with me at the moment.</p>
<p>Before we could even get far enough away, the sound of a mighty burst  erupted in my ears, rendering my world soundless as flames swallowed  me whole. Everything around me was engulfed in a bright light, but it  was quickly replaced with utter darkness.</p>
<p>…<em>Am I…</em></p>
<p>A twitch of the hand.</p>
<p><em>Heh…not yet…</em></p>
<p>Collecting myself, I realizeed that I could feel a grainy substance  on my face along with a slight pressure that was covering my entire  body. Pushing my way to the surface, I embraced the cool air that  blew on my skin as I emerged from the sand.</p>
<p><em>Sand? And…ash? That thing…that…child…it destroyed  everything…</em></p>
<p>“Damn it,” I cursed, pulling myself to my feet, but the sight of  the redhead kneeling in the ashes with her brother, Mikoto by her  side, took priority of my thoughts.</p>
<p>“You…” is all I  could remark, totally dumbfounded. At a complete loss of words, I  stood absolutely silent and helpless, not able to do anything but  stare at the three forms at my feet.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
After helping the girl take her brother, as I found out, to the  school infirmary, I finally made it home, having to ride on Duran’s  back and then walk the rest of the way since my bike had been  vaporized in the blast, but when I got there I couldn’t sleep.  Plopping down on the black leather couch in the living room, I sat in  a daze not really knowing what to do. This didn’t last too long,  however, and I was soon up and walking around the room, trying to  keep myself busy as my nerves were still on end.
<p><em>How in the hell was that girl’s child that big… that powerful?  She had just awakened…I’ve been with Duran for what, five months?  Why isn’t he as staggering as that dragon or whatever it was? Are  they just like that? I wonder…Eh, no way I’m going to be able to  settle down tonight…not after that…God, and now I’ve got to get  another bike…I wonder if Yamada is up at this hour…</em></p>
<p>Reaching into my pocket, I pulled out my cell phone that miraculously  managed to stay in one piece during the whole ordeal that had taken  place just hours earlier. Punching in the man’s number, it rang  several times before he finally answered.</p>
<p>“<em>K-Kuga…?”</em></p>
<p>“Yamada, hey, sorry to call so late…well, early.”</p>
<p>The man yawned into the receiver, <em>“So what’s the problem?”</em></p>
<p>“I need a new bike.”</p>
<p>“<em>Huh? What happened to the other one?”</em></p>
<p>“It’s...eh, gone.”</p>
<p>“<em>Gone?”</em></p>
<p>“Yeah, you don’t want to know...So can you help me out?”</p>
<p>“<em>Hmm…Yeah, I know a guy who I can probably get you a good deal  with.”</em></p>
<p>“And I can get one just like my old model?”</p>
<p>“<em>Most likely.”</em></p>
<p>“By noon?”</p>
<p>“<em>You sure are pushing it, Kuga...”</em></p>
<p>“Can you do it or not?”</p>
<p>“…<em>Yeah, leave it to me.”</em></p>
<p>“Thanks, Yamada. I’ll add a little extra for this one.”</p>
<p>“<em>Alright, meet me at </em><em>Rorschach in  half an hour. We’ll go from there.”</em></p>
<p>“Right. See you.”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Later that day, after Yamada and I had successfully hunted down a new  motorcycle for myself and I had purchased a new matching helmet from  the local biking store and taken a long hot shower back at the  apartment, I headed off to the school. There was something I needed  to look up about the girl from last night, and the only way I could  obtain that information was through Shizuru’s computer.
<p>When I arrived at the school, it was nearly time for the students  inside to be let out. After changing into my uniform, I quickly  headed to the second floor, but before I could reach the student  council room, the bell rang. Cursing under my breath, I fought  against the crowd, but at the sound and sight of a rather large group  of girls, I physically and mentally shuddered.</p>
<p><em>Oh god…Fujino fan club…</em></p>
<p>My theory was that this insane group of girls had secretly formed  many years before I actually met Shizuru and that they had merely  used her Kaichou position as an alibi for finally going public about  it. Since then it had only grown. Of course, like any club, some were  more die-hard fans than others. In fact, Shizuru had scored herself a  very dedicated group of seven girls that just about followed her  every move. It was a shock to the system that they hadn’t  discovered the friendship between the chestnut-haired girl and  myself…and inevitably taken me to the gallows because of it.</p>
<p><em>I’m sure they’d just loathe the idea of their beloved  Kaichou-san spending time with me rather than one of them.</em></p>
<p>The thought, and mental image that accompanied it, brought a smirk to  my face as I backtracked to the outside of the building again.  Finding the tree that resided closest to the student council window,  I clambered up before stopping on the largest branch, which just  happened to be the closest to my objective. Peering inside, I watched  as Shizuru finally managed to get into the room and close the door  behind her, locking it as quickly as possible. I could see her body  relax, finally getting away from all the girls who monitored her  every breath.</p>
<p>She had just sat down and taken out her laptop when I decided to make  my move. Making sure my footing was steady, I balanced myself on the  branch, muscles coiling and beginning to sting from the strain.  Unleashing my built up power, I sprung from my place in the tree,  flying through the air momentarily before my hands gripped the pane,  my body inevitably crashing against the side of the school seconds  later. I pulled myself up, resting my upper body on the windowsill,  before knocking lightly on its glass.</p>
<p>Crimson eyes immediately shot in my direction, absolute puzzlement  completely unrestrained as I see Shizuru mouth my name. I gave her a  little wave as if everything was perfectly normal as she quickly  stood and glided over to the window, opening it with all haste.</p>
<p>“Hey,” I casually said as I hoisted myself up on the windowpane  with a small grunt, “Sorry about that.”</p>
<p>“There is a door, you know,” Shizuru replied, helping me the rest  of the way inside, the confusion in her voice is still quite evident.</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, like I was about to take my chances braving your crowd  of followers.”</p>
<p>“So instead you opted to come through the window? They would have  gone away…eventually…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, <em>eventually</em> being the key word. You’ll have to  forgive me for not wanting to show up in some shady back ally as a  lifeless corpse,” I remarked in complete sarcasm…Well, <em>almost</em> complete sarcasm. I really was afraid of that cult.</p>
<p>“You know I wouldn’t let them lay a finger on you, Natsuki.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if you’d be able to control them, Miss Kaichou, I  mean, they hold on to every word you say, but if they knew that you  were talking with me of all people, I think they’d go ballistic.”</p>
<p>A sly grin spread across the girl’s face, “Ara…Fine. If Natsuki  insists, we shall keep our little affair a secret.”</p>
<p>“What are you calling an affair?!” I questioned, cheeks flaring  bright red.</p>
<p>Shizuru just chuckled at me before thankfully changing the subject as  she circled her desk and sat back down in her usual chair, “So,  what is so important that Natsuki would risk her very well being?”</p>
<p>“I wanted check up on the records of one of the new transfer  students…a busty redhead. I don’t know her name.”</p>
<p>The mischievous glint in Shizuru’s burgundy eyes returned  instantaneously.</p>
<p>“So Natsuki <em>does</em> pay attention to appearances…especially a<em>certain</em> area, hm?” she teased, making sure to push her ample  bosom together for emphasis.</p>
<p>“Wh-what?!” I practically screeched at her before calming myself,  clearing my throat in the process, “Like you couldn’t notice that  girl’s…eh…<em>chest</em>.”</p>
<p>“Mou, it doesn’t seem like I’m quite good enough for Natsuki  then,” Shizuru pouted, looking down at her own.</p>
<p>“Oh, shut up! Do you know who I’m talking about or not?” I  pressed again, cheeks growing redder by the minute as I leaned  against the front of the desk, arms crossed as I defiantly refused to  look at her.</p>
<p>More of her sweet laughter tickled my ears, “I believe so…hold on  one moment…”</p>
<p>The girl rapidly set to her searching, the buttons on the keyboard  clicking quietly as she typed. I stared down at my dirty sneakers  while I waited, and just a minute or so later, Shizuru seems to have  found the girl in question.</p>
<p>“That girl?”</p>
<p>“Found her?” I asked, scooting back to actually sit on the desk  so I can lean back to look at the screen. I scanned over it quickly,  soon finding what I was looking for.</p>
<p>“Just as I thought. She came here with the Kazahana Scholarship.”</p>
<p>“Why do you care about her?” Shizuru inquired.</p>
<p>“No reason,” I replied rather plainly, distracted by still trying  to piece the puzzle together.</p>
<p>“Something to do with the mountain?”</p>
<p>This grabbed my attention as I gasped at her speculation.</p>
<p><em>How did she…can Shizuru read me this easily? Well, she is pretty  sharp…</em></p>
<p>Trying to play it cool, I pushed myself off of the desk, keeping my  back to her as I talked, “Sorry, I don’t want to get you  involved.”</p>
<p>It was true; I really didn’t want to drag Shizuru into all of this  mess, even if it was just her knowing the smallest ounce of what was  going on, especially if something like last night were to happen  again. It was far too dangerous for even us Hime’s, so any normal  person would be even more at risk to be injured or worse in a  situation like that. No, I couldn’t expose my brown-eyed friend to  this world…<em>my </em>world. Maybe one day I could tell her about  it, but for now I would continue to keep her in the dark.</p>
<p>“That’s a cute comment,” the girl behind me responded, shaking  me from my thoughts with a sweet joyful tone mixed in with her slight  teasing.</p>
<p>Looking over my shoulder, I couldn’t help but blush.</p>
<p><em>All I want to do is keep you safe, and all you can do is tease  me...</em></p>
<p>“Ara…I did not mean to seal you up, Natsuki. What’s on your  mind?”</p>
<p>“That’s just it, there’s too much…I can’t even think  straight right now…” I let slip before I could even catch myself.</p>
<p>“I know I have said it before, but I’ll say it again…you can  always talk to me…about anything.”</p>
<p>The sincerity in her voice was so genuine and so very tempting,  making it hard to turn down her offer, but I somehow managed to,  “Heh, don’t worry about it. It’s stupid, I shouldn’t be  complaining so much.”</p>
<p>“I see,” came Shizuru’s simple response, and although she  sounded contented with my answer, I knew better. She wasn’t okay  with it at all, but she had agreed to leave it at that for my sake.</p>
<p>An awkward silence filled the room, but not too long after, voices  were heard outside the door. I recognized them to be Kanzaki Reito  and Tate Yuichi, and sure enough, the two boys enter shortly after.</p>
<p>“Kuga Natsuki,” Tate dumbly stated the obvious. I stood to face  them both as Reito closed the door behind him, straightening my  wrinkled skirt in the process.</p>
<p>“Oops, did we interrupt something?” the vice president questioned  in a teasing tone mirroring Shizuru’s.</p>
<p>“You’re so mean. We were in a good mood, too,” the  chestnut-haired girl replied in a fake disappointed manner. Or at  least she makes it out to be that way.</p>
<p>“Shizuru…” I half questioned.</p>
<p><em>What’s that supposed to mean?</em></p>
<p>Reito merely laughed, “Just joking, take your time. Ah, right,  let’s make some tea. I think we had a good Mandarin.”</p>
<p>“I’m preparing it?” Tate inquired, not looking too happy about  what his superior was implying.</p>
<p>I wasn’t too happy about where this was leading either. The last  thing that I wanted right now was to be stuck here sipping tea with  the student council when I could be doing something productive…and  by something productive, that meant just about <em>anything </em>else.</p>
<p>“I’m leaving,” I blatantly proclaimed, the agitation plain on  my face.</p>
<p>“Don’t say that. Relax for a while,” Shizuru tried coaxing me  while standing.</p>
<p>I turned my head to meet her gaze, my expression still rather  displeased. I knew what she was getting at…she just wanted to spend  some time with me, and I wanted to spend some more time with her as  well, but now wasn’t the time for that, especially since the boys  were now involved too. I still couldn’t help feeling bad about it  though.</p>
<p><em>Shizuru…</em></p>
<p>Luckily for me, the phone rang before I had to make up an excuse, and  Shizuru immediately picked it up and sliped it to her ear.</p>
<p>“Student Council Room.”</p>
<p>A momentary pause.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Another break.</p>
<p>“The Board of Directors is?”</p>
<p>This certainly captured my attention, and I held my breath until my  friend spoke again.</p>
<p>“Yes…Yes…I’ll send her right away…Goodbye.”</p>
<p>Placing the receiver back in it’s holder, the brunette turned to  the two males still standing in front of the door, “Ara, would you  two mind picking up Miss Tokiha-san from the infirmary and escorting  her to the Director’s residence?”</p>
<p><em>What?! That girl! Mmh…I guess I really shouldn’t be  surprised…the Director talked to me too after I awakened…but this  is so soon…maybe I should tag along…</em></p>
<p>Although Tate appeared to be a little more than annoyed at the  request, Reito answered for them both, “So that’s why they were  calling…Of course Fujino-san, Yuichi and I will go there right  away.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” came Shizuru’s simple reply as we watch the two  leave the room once again. I was quick to follow behind.</p>
<p>“Mou, you too, Natsuki? Leaving me all alone?”</p>
<p>I paused halfway out the door to answer her, “Yeah, I really do  have something to take care of.”</p>
<p>“So much for putting off my work a little while longer…” the  crimson eyed girl sighed.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to hear that from the Seitokaichou <em>this</em> early in the year,” I jabbed at her before slipping away.</p>
<p>Rather than tail this <em>Mai</em>, I optted to just go ahead and make  my way over to the Director’s residence. I only waited around for a  few minutes until I heard her and Tate approach. They exchanged a  not-so-fond farewell before Tokiha soloed her way to the entrance.  The Director’s pink-haired maid, Himeno Fumi, greeted her before  she was nearly tackled to the ground by none other than Minagi  Mikoto.</p>
<p><em>Hmm…Talking to both of them…what I coincidence, huh?</em></p>
<p>When the Director herself appeared, a few brief introductions were  made before all four entered the mansion, out of my view and out of  my hearing.</p>
<p><em>Tch…Oh well, I’m sure she’ll just receive the same spill  about fighting the orphans and so on…I guess I can always ask her  later…maybe…Either way, there’s no point in hanging around for  now.</em></p>
<p>Following my own advice, I began making the trek back to my bike so I  could return home and hopefully, for once in the past couple of days,  get some decent sleep.</p>
