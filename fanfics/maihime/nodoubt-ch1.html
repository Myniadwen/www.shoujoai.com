<br>
It&#39;s amazing how she can make a simple shrug look graceful and effortless. 
Hidden within this passive motion, her mind is turning, wheels upon 
wheels, and I wonder what she&#39;s thinking of at that moment.<br>
<br>
<i>Yes?</i><br>
<br>
For once, my tongue is lax, without a reply as I search her eyes in 
the dim twilight, caught up in their preternatural glow.<br>
<br>
<i>It&#39;s nothing.</i> An almost imperceptible frown skirts the corners 
of her mouth as she holds my stare for a moment longer before turning 
back to her work. She has a paper due tomorrow for her Motorcycle Fuel 
Systems instructor; it&#39;s an &quot;annoyingly detailed class&quot; (her 
words) so I know her attention is as focused and precise as a surgeon&#39;s 
scalpel. It&#39;s times like these when I&#39;m most tempted to tease her, to 
drive her to distraction. This moment, however, is more distracting 
for me.<br>
<br>
Cool breezes from the open window dry the trickles of sweat rolling 
down her neck, between her breasts, leaving luscious, salty tracks on 
her skin. Natsuki distractedly pushes back a stray hair from her forehead 
giving me a clearer view of those eyes I adore so much. Whatever <i>
kami</i> that is enticing me with this lovely gift surely has a twisted 
sense of humour.<br>
<br>
<i>Oi. What are you looking at?</i><br>
<br>
I shrug. <i>What do you think?</i><br>
<br>
She sighs halfheartedly. <i>Can&#39;t you ever give a straight answer?</i><br>
<br>
<i>I could if you would, perhaps, ask a more direct question.</i> A 
playful smirk dances on my lips. I can&#39;t help it; she rises to take 
the bait every time.<br>
<br>
Her hand pauses above the page. It seems I may have gone a bit too far. <i>
Nothing to worry about, dear. You finish your work.</i> Patting her 
arm gently, I gather up our teacups and pot, place them on the lacquered 
tray she gave me as a Christmas present and prepare to take them into 
the kitchen. Before I can stand, however, I feel butterfly kisses on 
my neck, my shoulders. She moved faster than I thought possible. I must 
make a mental note of that....she can be sneaky when necessary.<br>
<br>
<i>Think you can tease me and get away with it, eh?</i><br>
<br>
<i>Oh but that was not necessary. I was quite serious.</i> Natsuki removes 
the tray from my hands; I can feel the warmth of her breath, oh so close, 
raising goosepimples on my sensitive flesh.<br>
<br>
<i>We&#39;ll just have to see how serious you really are.</i> A ghost of 
a smile shades her mouth.<br>
<br>
My aim is true. Of that, we both have no doubt.</body></html><hr>
