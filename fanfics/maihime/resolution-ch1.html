<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It’s  been a while / My Letter #1</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  dark by the time the conversion van’s headlights illuminated the  lonely string of beachside cabins, but of them, only Midori was at  all tired; the chaos within the van had gradually given way to  casual, airy conversation, just loud and interesting enough to keep  everybody awake—except, it seemed, for Midori, who nearly passed  out at the wheel about an hour down Route 260. They had noticed when  the van began sneaking towards the rather deep ditch by the side of  the road, and it had started them shouting, which did nothing to wake  the girl up.  (Just) before they had died, Reito had managed to grab  the wheel and convince Midori to pull over long enough to let him  drive the rest of the way.  It turned out that he was actually an  adequate driver, which was lucky, since none of the rest of them knew  a clutch from an emergency brake.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As Reito  carefully slid the van into one of the few remaining parking slots,  Mai turned to Mikoto.  “Excited?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Excited!”  the girl echoed cheerfully.  “Excited, excited, excited!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me  too. I haven’t had a vacation from work in…”  Mai sucked her  lip between her teeth and chewed a little pensively.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In a  long time,” Shizuru Fujino said from the back seat, shaking her  light-brown hair out of her face and stretching a little as the car  jerked to a stop a little roughly.   From the front seat, Reito  shouted, “Sorry about that.  I think I killed it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  no problem,” Shizuru replied politely, and then looked back at Mai.   “You haven’t stopped working since school was called back, have  you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  frowned, still chewing her lip.  “I guess not.  I didn’t actually <em>mean </em>to work that much, I just—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mai  just wanted to get away from me,” Chie quipped as Midori groggily  got out and opened the door for them.  “She knows that if she  doesn’t, I’ll never stop hounding her about Tate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Both Mai  and Tate coughed when she said this, though neither said anything.  Mai got out, and as soon as she did, she heard Aoi and Chie burst out  laughing. <em>I thought she said she would lay off for the trip, </em>Mai  thought. <em>I told her I’d tell her when something happened. Not  that she wouldn’t know before </em>I <em>did if something happened  between us. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  actuality, the situation between Tate and Mai had remained more or  less in stasis since last year:  Mai had a half-kiss and a  spur-of-the-moment declaration by the boy of, “I love Mai!”, both  of which had been acquired at around the same time, to treasure, and  that was it.  There had been nothing since.  It was hard, with Shiho  attached to his arm <em>all the time</em>, clinging</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>like a  stubborn baby</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">like a  stubborn cold to him, undoubtedly more than a little to make sure  that what Mai had was all she would ever have with the boy.  Shiho  had Tate’s image firmly embedded within her heart, and as far as  she was concerned, he was hers so long as he didn’t fling her off.  Mai bore it with all the patience that she had learned over seventeen  years of taking care of her sick brother, but sometimes, she just  wanted to…<br />
      <em>smack  the little—</em><br />
  to do  something that she would most certainly regret for the rest of her  life, and that she would thus never even consider actually doing,  ever.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  half-pensive state was disturbed, rather rudely, as thestubborn <em>(baby) </em>cold’s small pink shoe impacted solidly on her rear,  half-knocking her into the car ahead of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Move,  please!” came the ex-cripple’s cheery voice as Mai struggled to  recover her temper and her bearings at the same time. Shortly after,  Tate chided her as an exasperated parent or brother might, but not  harshly. <em>Never harshly. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  grumbled a, “Sorry,” and stepped aside, rubbing her now-aching  rump with one hand as the rest of the car piled out quickly,  spreading out and stretching with the forced isolation one can only  be grateful of after spending four or five hours in a car with your  best friends. Reito walked around to the back and opened up the full  trunk as Mikoto located Mai and started rubbing the older girl’s  rump, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai’s  eyes flew open and her attention flew back into the present, and she  jumped into the air with a startled cry as Mikoto burst out laughing  again.  “Are you excited?” the little girl quipped, and for a  moment, Mai stared at her, dumbfounded by her rare display of sharp  verbal wit.  Then she got over it and tore off after the little shit,  who took off running, throwing her arms up in the air and shouting,  “Mai’s excited, all right, yes she is!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  laughed in an incestuously brotherly way, walking over to Tate.  The  fake-blonde was presently being made to lug not only his luggage, but  Shiho and <em>her </em>luggage, and the strain showed on his face.  Even Kendo, which was strenuous by its very nature, was not enough to  prepare him for the torment on his back that was Shiho <em>and </em>her  luggage.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose we’re relatively secluded, then, eh Tate?” he said to the  boy, grinning with pursed lips.  “Being two of the only three males  on the trip.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose,” Tate replied a little guardedly, as he had been the boy  since Mai and he had begun doing…whatever it was they were doing.  Reito had been turned down by Mai, and while he didn’t display any  outward malice at the rejection, that meant very little.  “Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  just thinking about our old roommate days.  You know…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tate  did. Reito and he had, as most male roommates did, an unspoken  agreement to sod off if there was a signal left on the door that the  other was in there with a girl, in private.  Did this mean Reito was  planning on…with Mai?  Or somebody else?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure.   Not a problem.  Just leave my <em>shinai </em>on the door.  It’s a  good reminder for me to practice. Who…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  knows?”  Reito said with a shrug.  Outwardly, he was a very  brotherly figure, very benevolent, kind, and intelligent, but Tate  knew from experience that he was a little bit of a letch on the  inside.  He didn’t let it show often, and never to women, but guys  could usually tell who was who among even the most guarded of them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  are you guys talking about?” Shiho asked from Tate’s back,  sounding as confused as Tate was, though for entirely different  reasons.  He had entirely forgotten she was back there for a second,  obviously considering the screaming strain on his back to be just  another ugly face of gravity.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  just speaking Guy at Tate,” Reito said, smiling warmly.  “Most  civilized beings don’t understand the language.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  weird.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Forgive  me,” Reito said, bowing slightly.  “You may, however, wish to let  go of Tate before his back snaps.  You’re as beautiful and trim as  a lady, but I think your brother is about to die.  He needs to work  harder at Kendo.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shiho,  take your luggage and go follow the girls, okay?”  Tate pointed at  the cabin they were to inhabit, a small log cabin like all the  others, mounted on small risers with a long stairway and a ramp  leading to the doorway, and one window per face.  “I need a rest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmph,”  Shiho grimaced, a little disheartened.  She dropped off his back,  though, and did as he asked.  After she was out of earshot, Tate  looked the other boy in the eye.  “Sometimes I think she  understands a lot more than she lets on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Almost  certainly. She is very clever, even if she never shows it; I’m  sorry if I was too blunt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t think she understood that, but she certainly understood that  we wanted to get rid of her, and she’ll give me hell for it.  So  make it fast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Denying  it would be useless, I suppose.  I want to talk to you openly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  knew that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  smiled humbly.  “I’d like to make amends with you; we know that  if we both actively seek Mai’s affections, no good will come of us  sleeping in the same room with only Kazu to buffer us.  Therefore, I  would like to propose that for the trip, neither of us make any  overtures towards her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tate  frowned.  Not that he thought it would make a difference, but  something about it irked him.  Maybe the way Reito said it, so easily  and without reservation.  Nonetheless, he nodded.  In truth, he  missed the boy, who had acted as something of a father-figure for him  during the year they’d roomed together, all the way up until the  point where he was revealed to be an ancient, evil creature stealing  Reito’s body.  “All right.  I won’t make any moves on Mai if  you won’t.”  Not that it would matter.  Shiho would be sleeping  in the next room, so his chances of sneaking off with her even if she  was the sneaking-off type were nil.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even so…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  stuck his hand out, and Tate took it, pumped it once.   “I’m glad  you…you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know.  Things have been a little awkward between us, and we both know  why.  Until we settle into this, they will remain that way, and I  don’t like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me  either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  inform Kazuya when I get a chance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  nodded at each other, and then shouldered their bags, closed the  trunk, and locked the doors.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  cabin was as small inside as it was outside, but at least it had two  bathrooms.  It was essentially a square space divided into two  rectangles, separated by a thick wall.  Both sections were identical,  containing an entryway, a bedroom, and a bathroom with a shower.  The  girls slept in one, the boys in the other.  It was cheap and still  proper—two things one did not often find in coed lodgings.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  also, Natsuki Kuga noted, completely empty.  Her senses were still  keen, even after all the time it had been since she’d fought…well,  anything, and she heard nothing coming from any orifice of the cabin.   How could that be? Hadn’t she just stepped out for a little air?  Where had everybody gone?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No.  Not  completely empty.  Somebody was breathing heavily in the girl’s  bedroom.  Breathing heavily and sobbing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  wished she had a gun.  She had one in her bag, one which her formerly  all-encompassing streak of paranoia had forced her to go out and buy  off of one of her old connections—guns were illegal in Japan—almost  the week after she’d lost her powers (as everyone else had) as a  HiME, but that was also <em>in </em>the room.  Buried deep in her bag.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nothing  to do, though, but investigate.  She stepped in the door and removed  her shoes, or tried to: She had no shoes to remove. That wasn’t  right; she must have had shoes, she had just been outside.  The fact,  however, remained that her feet were bare, and a little chilly.  She  felt a draft on her crotch, and closed the door behind her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  stepped inside and walked quietly along the well-sanded floor, which  creaked under her weight only a little, towards the bedroom she  shared with eight other people, and opened the door quietly, not  wanting to disturb any of them on the off-chance that they <em>were </em>there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Only  none of them were there. Just as she’d observed, the place was  completely empty.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  the hell is…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No,  not completely empty.  Just as she’d observed.  There was one  person at the corner of the room, buried deep inside of a sleeping  bag.  All she could see was a fluff of light brown hair sticking out  of the opening.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Shizuru. </em>This was rapidly becoming dangerous.  Even more so as the bag  began to move towards her, and then slowly slid off of the thin,  pretty girl, revealing her to be completely naked.  Natsuki’s eyes  widened in surprise, and she quickly lowered her gaze as the girl  moved soundlessly across the bedroom towards her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before  Natsuki could move further, though, Shizuru was on her, wrapping her  arms around the shorter girl’s waist, pressing her bare breasts  against her, warm and soft…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Warm?<br />
  Soft?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  looked down and found herself to be completely naked.  She cried out  in surprise, and Shizuru covered Natsuki’s mouth with hers, her  eyes wide open, staring into Natsuki’s, which widened in<br />
      <em>lust</em><br />
  fear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  pulled her mouth away quickly, embarrassed and blushing, and shouted,  “Shizuru—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Shizuru’s  head exploding, her pretty brown hair decorating the carpet across  the room—</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  sat bolt upright and shouted, “No!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Natsuki,”  Chie said groggily, “Keep it down.  Some of us are trying to  sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  froze, looking around at the eight girls around her as her heart  raced madly in her chest and she struggled to separate the dream from  what was real.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked over at Shizuru, sleeping peacefully in the corner with a  small smile on her face, and exhaled heavily, forcing herself to  relax, to sleep again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  didn’t work.  She didn’t go back to sleep that night.</span></p>
