<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  feel like…I feel like maybe I could disappear. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  had only thought this once before in her life, and it had come to her  in the same way: In the midst of external chaos and internal peace.  Not a lighthouse on the ocean at night, but a candle in the woods at  dusk, not something to be guided by, but something to pay heed to  nonetheless.  Something not to let go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And just  as</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>do  you hate me that much!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">before,  Shizuru felt as though she was grasping at straws to drink with as  the river dried up in front of her.  Trying to hang on to something  she had held onto for a long time while the thing that she <em>actually </em>needed slipped away from her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chaos  around her.  Yes.  Chaos.  She was at utter peace during times of the  greatest chaos.  Those were the times when she knew precisely what to  do.  It was the <em>rest </em>of her life she had trouble with. Trying  to balance school and work and</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Natsuki</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">the  things she wanted that had to do with neither.  Shizuru felt her eyes  slide shut, block out the clamor of the chaos around her.  In doing  this, she was able to see what she needed to see.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Natsuki.  I feel like maybe I could disappear. </em>It echoed in her mind, and  as before, she clung onto it. <em>Natsuki.  I feel like maybe I could  disappear.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Natsuki.<br />
  I  feel like…<br />
  Disappear…<br />
  Natsuki…<br />
  Natsuki-Ru.<br />
  Ru.<br />
  </em>--Ru?<br />
  “Shizuru?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  blinked the world returned to her in a wave.  Immediately, she found  her vision unexpectedly, though not-unpleasantly filled with  Natsuki’s large, green eyes.  The chaos was still around her.  Nothing had changed since she’d retreated into her own head,  allowed herself that small, temporary respite. She blinked again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”  she said, her voice just a little muddled, as though she’d been  woken from a nap.  After that, she spoke more slowly, to cover the  effect. “I’m sorry. Did I drift off?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  shook her head.  “I’m not sure.” For a moment, Shizuru was  certain of the presence of … something, some emotion that she  couldn’t entirely place…in Natsuki’s voice, but in the next  second, it was gone, replaced by the flat, slightly aloof tone that  Natsuki used to separate herself from the rest of the world, usually  right about when the rest of the world wanted something out of her.  “I was just trying to get your attention.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  did you want, Natsuki? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Did  you want to tell me something?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,”  Shizuru’s voice was still having that problem of being unable to  sound as though she had been awake for more than a minute or two.  “I’m sorry.  Was it important?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  shook her head. “It can wait.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  looked straight into Natsuki’s eyes, and realized she couldn’t  tell what exactly Natsuki meant by that.  She couldn’t read her at  all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That had  happened before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That had  happened most often around the same time she had been thinking about  disappearing.  Shizuru felt her chest shiver a little, as though she  was cold in spite of the warmth of the sun, which was, little by  little, fading into the horizon, dashing the ocean with just the  faintest hint of pink.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  ocean is never really anything but transparent, </em>she mused, her  mind traveling off on a whim even as her subconscious took over for  her actions, directing her to smile as Chie raced by with Aoi in hot  pursuit; directed her to step aside as Mai and Mikoto blew past her,  close to knocking her down. <em>It’s nothing by itself; it forms its  own color by absorbing other colors.  What it doesn’t absorb is  what we see painted on its surface. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Natsuki  is nothing like the ocean. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  moved aside as Chie and Aoi looped around.  Apparently, Chie was  currently in possession of some personal article of Aoi’s, or  possibly of Mai’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She  absorbs what you don’t see. She absorbed all the bad things, and  yet…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  was watching the quickly-developing race, seemingly uninterested.  She didn’t notice Shizuru studying her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Studying </em>was perhaps not the right word;<em> studying </em>implied some  science or method to the way Shizuru’s eyes traveled over Natsuki’s  long, dark hair, catching the wind just <em>so, </em>so that the fine  strands of hair blew back as one, framing her melancholy,  light-skinned face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Without  meaning to, Shizuru found herself gazing at Natsuki’s lips.  Small,  pale, and<br />
      <em>maybe…still  a little moist</em><br />
  soft.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before  her gaze could travel any farther downwards, though, Natsuki’s eye  twitched slightly, and Shizuru, already on edge, diverted her gaze  towards the ocean immediately. As soon as she stopped being able to  see Natsuki, however, it was like her vision ceased to be something  worthy of her attention.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It is  a beautiful thing to see only one person.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  was sure she had said that to somebody once.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shizuru?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  reacted automatically, as though the voice coming seemingly out of  nowhere—it was, in fact, coming from behind her—hadn’t  surprised her: “Yes?” She turned around to find Reito standing  there, and smiled without thinking about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  grinned at her like an affectionate, mildly concerned, brother; it  was the same expression that had given half of Fuuka Academy’s  student body the impression that he and Shizuru were dating, and, in  some far-off corner of her brain, Shizuru understood why; it was a  smile which broadcasted, sincerely, the emotions it was meant to  imply. “Are you feeling all right?” Reito asked, his voice and  tone just a little formal.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  wondered briefly if Reito had, at some point in his life, been  honestly sincere about the feelings his smile put forth.  If he had  ever nursed some sort of attraction to her. It wasn’t the sort of  thing Reito would do, to simply let it sit and breed, but Shizuru was  still left wondering, if only because she had never really paid  attention to it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  in seeing only one person, you miss out on the cliff directly ahead  of you. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somebody  had said that to her. She couldn’t remember who, but somebody had.  It had been shortly after she had spoken of seeing only one person.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  I’m fine,” Shizuru said as though her little internal reverie was  nothing more than a thought, to be blown away with the winds of the  conversation.   “I’m sorry, did I look unwell?”  Privately, she  marveled at how little she sounded like she was actually speaking to  somebody when she addressed Reito.  Marveled and cursed; they had  never been intimate, but they <em>had </em>been close, and right at  that moment, Shizuru felt a sort of wall blocking <em>something </em>between them; something necessary for easy communication.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t know, however, from where this wall had come.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And yet,  Reito gave no sign that he was at all fazed by her severe formality.  He just grinned and relaxed his own tone, as though in response.  “You were just staring out at the ocean. I had called for you  several times, actually.” Reito said it with just a touch of  sheepishness, and Shizuru frowned. That wasn’t like her, and yet  this was the second time it had happened to her in less than ten  minutes.  As though reading her thoughts, Reito continued, “If I  interrupted you, I apologize.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  smiled at him and said, “No, there’s nothing to apologize for,”  even as she dug her nails into her palms, resisting the flow of  helplessness that washed over her in the face of Reito’s  near-perfect disingenuousness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But, of  course, she didn’t. She never did. Ever.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you certain there’s nothing troubling you?” His tone was formal  enough that he may as well have thrown a brick at her, reminding her, <em>hey, talking behind a wall, remember? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  trouble is, Reito, I got something I’ve sought for a long, long  time today.  I got something from Natsuki, and I want to treasure it,  store it, keep it somewhere in me where nobody else can have it, ever  ever ever, but something in her eyes tells me that even if I have  that, I don’t have </em>her,<em> and I know nobody’s supposed to  possess</em> anybody <em>but I can’t help thinking that maybe if I  just </em>“Just reflecting on the sunset.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  she said this, Shizuru’s mouth clenched itself shut.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Because  she knew that she would have been able to tell Reito at least a part  of that, some time ago. Back in the mythical <em>back then, </em>when  everything was good and right and happy, because that was <em>then </em>but  this was <em>now, </em>and nothing could ever be quite right <em>now. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked up at Reito, and saw something guarded within his eyes:  Concern.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then it  vanished as his eyes flicked upward, away from Shizuru and the ocean  for a moment, towards something distant on the beach.  Shizuru waited  the requisite ten seconds, allowing the silence to settle in over  them like dust after a sandstorm, and then flicked her own eyes to  where Reito had, and saw what he had seen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She saw  Midori, chatting idly with Chie, who had Aoi in a half-headlock.  Midori looked as carefree as she ever did, a sentiment that Shizuru  was fully aware was a complete fabrication. As did, she suspected,  all of the ex-HiME.  It was impossible to say that somebody who  fought with as much skill and vigor as Midori was carefree.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Then  again, I suppose that makes it impossible to call me carefree,  either.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>After  all, I </em>did…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  closed her mind off before she remembered things that she most  certainly did <em>not </em>want to remember.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shizuru?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I did  it again. I need to start pinching myself. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”  she asked with a smile that she had to drag, kicking and screaming,  onto her face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito’s  eyes flicked upwards again, and Shizuru felt a pang inside of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Would  you like some tea in the cabin?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  blinked.  Before, when they had both attended the same school, that  had been code for, <em>we should talk. Privately. </em>Whether it  still was now, Shizuru couldn’t say. She stood anyway, and glanced  at Natsuki.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki,  who was still studying the sunset. Who, in that very singular moment,  may as well have <em>been </em>the sunset.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  honestly didn’t know what that meant. She only knew that Natsuki,  so utterly absorbed in what she saw, seemed unbearably far away.  Shizuru could have reached out and touched her, stroked her hair,  felt it flow between her fingertips, and it would have seemed no more  real than grasping at the fading rays of the sun.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  shook her head and stood up. “Yes.  That, I think, would be nice.  Natsuki,” she said to nothing at all, “I’m going for a while.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  nodded absently.  Which meant that she was listening, and probably,  Shizuru thought, that she was experiencing some sort of turmoil of  her own.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  felt that she might never know what that turmoil was.  And that  thought alone was enough to make her want to start walking into the  ocean, and not stop.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  only a momentary thought, though. She forced it from her head and  followed Reito to the cabin.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The man  with the scratchy voice was disappointed in his agents’ lack of  progress, but at the same time, mildly impressed at what had been  stifling them.  Provided that his agents’ reports were accurate,  that is.  In fact, if these reports were accurate, he was fairly well  delighted.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was,  after all, <em>quite </em>rare for a modern paramilitary organization  to do battle with a group of ninja.  While the man with the scratchy  voice was not one to dwell upon fortune or glory, he recognized  clearly the invaluable status such a victory would impart his  organization.  Those who may be his rivals sometime in the near  future would be those who already knew of this clan of ninja, he  speculated; and that would mean that they would know who defeated  them.  And then…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  then they would know who it is they should fear. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  thumbed his radio with some flourish.  “All field units,” he  rasped into the receiver, “we have an added objective: Observation  and decimation of the intervening ninja.  If you have a shot,  gentlemen, please take it. You may not get a second one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  were no replies, no calls of <em>roger</em> to answer him.  Hopefully,  the man with the scratchy voice thought, this would mean that at  least one of his units <em>did </em>have a shot.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
James  Sunderland did, indeed, have a shot.  Or, at least, he thought he  did: His eye was sharp; as sharp as that of any other sniper of his  relatively young age, but his confidence was not.  He was at that  crucial stage of professional development that Minoru Alder could  have told him was the most dangerous part of his career; before he  achieved the relatively serene wisdom of age, but after his  adolescent reflexes had begun to fade.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Of  course, James’ reflexes were still very good, as was his eye.  He  had taken the top prize in the West Virginia National Guard’s  marksmanship competition in South Ashfield, three years in a row.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ninja,  however, were not big wood and metal targets, and, in the dark,  hidden crevasses of his mind—the same ones where, nightly, he  imagined that he finally got up the balls to cheat on Chandra with  that girl, Yumiko, that he’d met at his hotel—he honestly had no  idea whether he had been staring, through his scope, at a human or a  blob of shadow cast by a tree for the past ten minutes.  It was  starting to scare him: Ninja weren’t even supposed to exist! Who  was to say what this one, if it is one, could do to him?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Tear  down this tree branch with a single stroke of his hand</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That  could well be him and he could just vanish as soon as I pull the  trigger and give away my position and  then who knows what could  happen to me isn’t that what happened to that other guy</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The wind  started to blow at that point, and James cursed silently.  James had  cursed like a sailor back in South Ashfield.  He had stopped after  his first assignment, when his cursing reflex had nearly gotten him  killed by an attentive perimeter guard on the outskirts of a Russian  outpost somewhere just outside of Bumfuck, Yugoslavia.  Maybe he  would have cursed with more flourish if he’d known it was the last  time he would ever get to do it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  shadow shifted and James Sunderland, no longer possessing the  reflexes of his youth, not yet having acquired the wisdom of age,  hesitated for half a second and then pulled the trigger.  His rifle  hissed, solitary sound that, in his mind, echoed throughout the  entire godforsaken forest around him. There was no cry of pain to  signal a hit, but also no scrambling of feet to signal a near miss.  He squeezed his left eye shut and pressed the scope to his right eye  as hard as possible, as though trying to pop it through the glass and  see just a little bit better.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nothing  was moving except the leaves.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He let  out a long, deep sigh and relaxed his shoulders just a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Nothing  there.  Nothing at all.  Just the wind casting some shadows; chances  are I just scared the pants off of some poor animal is all. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  allowing himself a few more breaths; long and deep, just like the  other, he shifted his position so that he was facing the camp where  his marks were currently playing in the sand, having a merry old time  that, under normal circumstances, would have made James a little  jealous.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ironically,  James wasn’t jealous because, at that moment, he was just happy to  be alive.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  peered through his scope again, trying to spot the one with the long,  brown hair.  It took him a few seconds to find her; she was  half-obscured by a tree, talking with a taller, handsomer boy with  darker hair wearing a fairly tasteful Hawaiian shirt.  James found  that to be a feat unto itself.  Again, though, no jealousy. The air  up by his branch was too damn sweet for that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Hey, </em>he thought as she began to follow him to the cabin, probably to  go screw or something, <em>maybe I’ll take her hint and go visit  Yumiko tonight.  Maybe that wouldn’t be such a </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  knife pierced James Sunderland’s spinal cord at the base of his  neck, in what was, in fact, only a millimeter off from where it had  pierced the spine of Nori Ikimasu.  His brain shut off immediately,  before he had a chance to think, <em>there had never been a ninja  there. He set up a decoy to draw me out.  There was nothing magical  about it at all, he was just waiting for me in some other tree, </em>something he undoubtedly would have considered given a little  time. He was, after all, not too far off from the age where wisdom  inevitably began to replace the void that his youthful reflexes had  left long ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  ninja left him hanging there by the straps which secured him to the  tree. It was a better hiding place for a body than any on the ground  because, the ninja knew, man’s biggest weakness was that he  considered the sky to be indefinitely out of reach, and as a result,  he never looked up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  ninja began moving, planning to report the kill and its implications  back to Akira.  He never got a chance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Harry  Townsend’s single, .308 caliber round did exactly what the field  manual had said it would: It blew through the front of the ninja’s  skull, made dogshit out of his brain, and then kept right on going,  its vector altered slightly due to the angle of the target’s head.  It wound up in a pile of leaves, probably half an inch under the  ground, maybe less.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not  exactly as he’d have liked it, but he didn’t mind. The ninja’s  body dropped to the ground, impacting with a <em>thunk </em>that, to  Harry, was reminiscent of dropping a sack of potatoes off of a  rooftop.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>About  time, too, </em>Harry thought. <em>I’d been aiming at that other  fucker for at least an hour. I was starting to get sick of it. </em>He  didn’t suppose James would have appreciated being used as bait.  But then, Harry supposed, he probably wasn’t going to catch any  shit for it.  Orders from the top, and all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just  orders.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
It  wasn’t long before Akira Okuzaki found her ninja’s body.  By that  time, though, Harry was long gone, along with the rest of his team,  but Akira still checked every single tree in the area, her knife  clutched tightly in her hand, fire in her eyes.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  supposed it would be time to talk to Minoru again. Apparently she had  underestimated “scratch-ass.”  She wouldn’t do that a second  time.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
A/N: I’ve  referenced two somewhat popular video games (Both on the PS2 and,  with less popularity, the PC) somewhere in this chapter. One is more  explicit than the other, which I have hidden slightly by altering it  just a little. Spot either or both, send me an email or leave it in a  review, and win a gold star.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wasn’t  exactly a Shiz/Nat chapter, huh.  I found it interesting to get into  Shizuru’s head, though.  I plan on getting into Natsuki’s next  time if I can, and I’m kinda curious to know what it is that  Shizuru is talking about with Reito.  Hopefully you’re as curious  as I am!</span></p>
