<em>What is it about  that girl, Natsuki?</em>
<p>I was on the way back  to my dorm and I just couldn’t get the question out of my mind.  Just hours before, Natsuki had paid me a surprise visit in the  student council room to investigate the new transfer student, Tokiha  Mai, but of course she wouldn’t tell me why. Was I jealous of  Natsuki’s interest in the girl? Maybe a little, but that wasn’t  my main concern. Tokiha-san had only been attending our school for a  few days, and already a couple of strange things had occurred, and  she was seemingly involved with both of them.</p>
<p>First off, she was  initially discovered in the front courtyard of our school, a dying  ring of flame around her and an unconscious girl, a path of  destruction leading directly up to the spot where the two were lying.  Suzushiro-san tried to question her about the situation, but  apparently she didn’t know how she had gotten there. Then, the very  next day, a section of the forest on the mountainside had been  completely burned to the ground. Forest fires weren’t common in our  area to begin with, but on top of that, the section burned was in a  straight line that suddenly stopped near the peak, almost like it had  been controlled.</p>
<p>How did I tie  Tokiha-san to the mountain incident? The initial clue that grabbed my  attention was the fact that this destruction, like the first,  involved fire. Second, because they had both occurred in such a short  time period, she was immediately included in the list of suspects.  And last but not least, because Natsuki had come asking about her the  very next day at school. These three things were about all I needed  to pin Mai-san to being <em>somehow</em> involved in the forest  burning.</p>
<p>Now the real question  was just how did she do it? The only display of power I had seen that  could manage something such as this was my child, Kiyohime. Was it  possible that this girl was a Hime too? If that were true, did  Natsuki know about the Himes as well? Was she…could she possibly  be…one of them just like me? These were, without a doubt,  exaggerated speculations, but they weren’t totally out of the  question either. For now I couldn’t be sure, but I would certainly  keep my senses on full alert for any traces of the truth.</p>
<p>So why couldn’t I just <em>ask</em> Natsuki about it? Honestly, I  think I was afraid. I was afraid that if I asked her if she was a  Hime she would inevitably figure out that I was one as well, and in  turn, distance herself from me. Well, distance herself more from me  than she already had, I suppose, and I knew in my heart that I  wouldn’t be able to handle that. I wouldn’t take that chance by  asking, but that also meant that I would have to be extremely careful  if I were to go out and about with my child. Yes, if I were to keep  an eye on Natsuki with Kiyohime’s help, then I would have to remain  totally out of sight.</p>
<p>Stealth, keeping to the shadows…I would live in a world of complete  darkness if it were for Natsuki’s sake.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Friday. Everyone’s  favorite day of the week. It had finally come; the last bell of the  day had rung, and now all I had to do was make it through an  hour-long student council meeting and I would be free for the  weekend.
<p>There was always a  ten-minute break between the end of school and the beginning of our  meetings to give the members time to take care of anything they  needed to do before hand. This allowed me to get to the room before  anyone else almost every day, but it was especially nice since it  gave Natsuki the time to use my computer before the other members  arrived. I never knew when she would come, so I made it a habit to  get to the room as quickly as possible every day.</p>
<p>I was doing just that  when I heard the girl call out to me. I turned around to see my  raven-haired friend jogging up to me and I smiled genuinely,  “Natsuki, so you actually made it to school today. I’m so proud.”</p>
<p>“Oi, that’s not a  very nice ‘hello’, Shizuru.”</p>
<p>“Gomen, Natsuki. So  what brings you here? Do you need to use my laptop again?”</p>
<p>“Eh, no, not today. I  was wondering…if maybe you’d want to go do something this  afternoon…I don’t know, just run around town or something.”</p>
<p>I was rather taken  aback by her words, my calm features breaking temporarily before I  drew them back together, “Ara, what brings this about?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Well…I  just…kind of needed a break from everything…” she began,  averting her gaze to the floor, “and I thought maybe you’d—”</p>
<p>“Of course,” I  answered before she could even finish, “But you do know that I have  a meeting right now. It’ll probably be about an hour before we let  out.”</p>
<p>“I can wait.”</p>
<p>My smile broadened,  “Alright, it’s a date then.”</p>
<p>“H-hey! I didn’t  say it was a…” Natsuki released a defeated sigh, “…I’ll be  waiting out back…”</p>
<p>I watched the girl’s  retreating back until she turned the corner before finally entering  the student council room.</p>
<p><em>I wonder what  brought this about? She did seem rather stressed the other day…I  guess it doesn’t really matter at the moment. I’m not going to  press her for answers she doesn’t want to reveal; all I can do is  be here for her now when she needs me.</em></p>
<p>Soon enough the meeting  began.</p>
<p>I got us in and out in  exactly thirty-seven minutes.</p>
<p>After everyone had  finally left, not quickly enough if you asked me, I made my way  downstairs and to the back exit of the building. I pushed my way out  the doors, swiveling my head back and forth in search of my friend.  When I spotted Natsuki a little ways down lounging under a tree, her  bike not too far away, I quietly walked over to her, leaning over her  dozing form to get a better look at the girl.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before  one of her green orbs peeked open to look at me, “Hey. Done  already?”</p>
<p>“We didn’t have too  much to discuss today,” I answered as I watch her get to her feet.</p>
<p>She immediately headed  for her motorcycle, “Sorry for being so short notice, I kind of  spontaneously gave myself a day off I guess.”</p>
<p>Trailing her, I could  only shake my head, “Don’t apologize. It wasn’t like I had  anything planed. I’m quite excited, actually. It’s been such a  long time since we’ve spent time together outside of school.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…sorry about  that,” she apologized again despite my previous words, a small  frown on her face as she handed me the helmet from the storage  compartment on the back of the bike.</p>
<p>“Let’s not think  about it, how about we just enjoy today, alright?”</p>
<p>I watched as the frown  on her face faded, replaced by a small smile before Natsuki sliped on  her helmet, “Right.”</p>
<p>Placing my own helmet  on my head, I took my usual position on the back of Natsuki’s bike  once she herself has straddled it. Slipping my arms around her waist,  I had to bite back the urge to let my hands explore her muscular  frame. It had been such a very long time since I had been this close  to her…Our bodies being so near to one another was intoxicating.<em>She</em> was intoxicating. I didn’t even notice my  ever-tightening grip until Natsuki’s voice snapped me out of my  daze.</p>
<p>“Hey, watch it,  Shizuru. Your nails are digging into my stomach.”</p>
<p>“Sorry…I guess I’m  always a little apprehensive before we take off,” I mumbled the  fake excuse while loosening my grip.</p>
<p>I could hear her  quietly laugh at me before she started the engine, and in a few  moments, we were cruising down the main road towards the city.</p>
<p>We had just reached the  first stoplight leading into the downtown area, which just happened  to turn red right before we could pass through, when thunder could be  heard off in the distance. At the sound, both Natsuki and myself  turned our gaze to the sky.</p>
<p>“Mmh…” came the  muffled throaty noise from the girl in front of me.</p>
<p>“Clouds…” I  followed up, voicing what we both saw.</p>
<p>About a mile down the  road the rain began to fall. It only took a few minutes for it to  start pouring down. I could hear Natsuki curse under her breath as  she turned onto another road and into a parking lot in front of a  tall building. She was swift to shut her bike off and promptly  dismount before helping me do the same.</p>
<p>“Come on,” she  ordered, motioning towards the nearby building before she took off  towards its entrance. I quickly followed.</p>
<p>Once inside, Natsuki  proceeded further, pushing a button on one of the walls before  finally turning to me, removing her helmet before speaking, “This  is where I live. We’ll just have to wait out the storm in my  apartment, I guess.”</p>
<p>I had just taken off my  helmet as well when the elevator dinged, the silver doors sliding  open to reveal an empty car. Natsuki and I stepped inside and she  immediately punched the number six button. The door closed leaving us  alone together for the silent ride up.</p>
<p>When we reached the top  floor, my friend led us straight ahead, stopping at the first door on  our right. After she had unlocked the door, she trekked on inside.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit of a  mess…” Natsuki stated, flipping a switch on the wall to  illuminate the room.</p>
<p>Stepping through the  door, I took in my unfamiliar surroundings. Natsuki’s place was  really more of a loft than an apartment. Giant windows spanning from  floor to ceiling covered the wall directly in front of us. If it  weren’t for the ever-darkening clouds outside and the giant  curtains that blocked what little light would be coming through, the  windows would have provided ample lighting for the entire room. A  large floor table resided in the middle of the room, a few stray  dishes adorning its surface. It seemed lonely with nothing else  nearby. Over to the left was an entertainment center against the  wall, decked out with the latest technologies. A large leather couch  along with two comfy-looking matching chairs, one on either side of  the couch, sat before it. By the left side of the couch stood a small  table with a lamp sitting on top. Further down a room bulged from the  wall. I could tell it was a kitchen due to the bar-like setup that  consisted of the wall facing me. Three stools were lined up in front  of it. On the right wall, directly across from the kitchen, was  another room, a bathroom it seemed, since the door was open revealing  a small sink. Connected to it was a smaller closet that held a washer  and dryer that could be hidden by sliding doors but weren’t at the  moment. In the right corner of the room resided a thin metal  staircase that led up to a railed walkway that clung to the wall. A  wall blocked the upstairs, so as to what it contained, I had no clue.</p>
<p>Natsuki was right  though…the whole place was a mess. There was trash everywhere  ranging from food wrappers and bottles to cardboard boxes and  packaging. Tools, motorcycle parts, and random articles of clothing  accompanied them. Before I could even begin to comment, the girl  interrupted me.</p>
<p>“We’d better change  out of these wet clothes before anything,” Natsuki stateed, walking  towards the staircase, having already removed her shoes.</p>
<p>I hadn’t even noticed  how cold I had become until she said this. My clothes were soaked  through and through, chill bumps spreading all over my body. After  slipping out of my brown loafers, I silently followed her to the  second floor. A stack of boxes rested right in front of us in the  corner of the room, but turning the corner revealed to me a bedroom  area. There was a single full-sized bed, its head against the wall  that faced out over the bottom level, to its left a small nightstand  with a lamp and a digital alarm clock. A computer desk was pressed  against the opposite wall, it’s side touching the wall of the  bathroom next to it. The door to the bathroom was just around the  corner, and diagonal of it was the door leading to the giant walk-in  closet.</p>
<p>Natsuki weaved her way  around the furniture to her closet, me close on her heels. She opened  the door for me, beaconing me inside, “Just take whatever you want,  I’m sure you can find something that fits.”</p>
<p>At that, she turned,  grabbed some clothes off of her bed, and confined herself in the  bathroom to quickly change out of her damp clothing. Closing the  closet door, I hastily shed my own drenched uniform. I sifted through  the room, which was honestly too big for the items it housed, and  eventually found something that…fit my tastes.</p>
<p>I waited until I heard Natsuki exit the bathroom before opening the  closet door and slipping outside.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I had just come out of  the bathroom adorned in a pair of blue and white nylon shorts and a  white tank, my soaked school uniform in my arms, when I heard the  door to my closet creak open.
<p>“Did you find  something to—!?”</p>
<p>Having just bent over  to pick up some stray articles on the floor, I turned and nearly  dropped the growing bundle in my arms. Shizuru was standing before  me…clad in only a white button up dress shirt that barely reached  the middle of her thighs. I could easily see her black lacey lingerie  beneath the thin white material.</p>
<p>The chestnut-haired  beauty was currently finishing buttoning up the shirt at the top when  she looked up at me, “What’s the matter with Natsuki? She’s all  red…”</p>
<p><em>You know very well  why I’m all red…</em></p>
<p>“Th-that’s not all  you’re wearing, is it?! You just came out to ask me something,  r-right?!” I nervously stuttered, pointing straight at her with my  free hand.</p>
<p>“Is there something  wrong with my choice of attire?” the girl questioned, looking over  herself as she started to roll the right sleeve of the shirt up past  her elbow.</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah, I think  you’re missing something important…”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“Pants! Normal people  wear <em>pants</em>, Shizuru,” I practically yelled.</p>
<p>“Mou, Natsuki…but  it’s hot in here…”</p>
<p>“I-I’ll turn up the  air conditioning then!”</p>
<p>Finished with the first  sleeve, Shizuru turned her attention to rolling the other, “I  wouldn’t want you to have to do that…”</p>
<p>“It’s no problem!  No problem at all!”</p>
<p>“Is Natsuki really  this upset about my choice of clothing?” The girl let out a sigh,  “Fine, if it’s bothering you this much I’ll put something else  on…”</p>
<p>At that, right then and  there, Shizuru began unbuttoning the white shirt.</p>
<p>I quickly turned away,  “Gah! No! Fine, wear that!”</p>
<p>“Okay then. I really  wish Natsuki would make up her mind though,” the burgundy eyed girl  teased, leaving her work where she was, the top two buttons undone.</p>
<p>Huffing, I stormed away  back towards the stairs, “Grab your uniform, I’ll throw it in the  dryer for now…”</p>
<p>I could plainly hear  Shizuru quietly giggling behind me all the way back downstairs.</p>
<p>Once we were back in  the living room, I trudged over to the dryer, opened the door, and  tossed my damp bundle into the machine before taking Shizuru’s from  her arms and doing the same. In the time it took for me to get the  thing up and running, my friend had ventured across the room and  taken a seat on one of the bar stools, her legs crossed and resting  on the bottom tick. Her elbow was on the bar’s metallic surface,  her delicate hand propping up her head as she watched me.</p>
<p>I blushed slightly when  our eyes met, but clearing my throat, I advanced forward and into the  kitchen, “So, uh, do you want anything? I’m afraid I don’t have  too much to choose from…I haven’t been the store in about two  weeks…”</p>
<p>“If you have water  that’ll be fine,” Shizuru replied.</p>
<p>“I think I do…” I  stated, as I went to search the fridge.</p>
<p>“So this is all  yours?” the girl inquired, making light conversation.</p>
<p>When I returned with  the bottle of water, I saw that the brunette was looking over her  shoulder back at the open room of my apartment. Setting the thing in  front of her, I leaned against the counter, “Mmh, yeah.”</p>
<p>“You really should  clean up every now and then, you know,” she commented while turning  back to face me.</p>
<p>I cocked an eyebrow,  “Lecturing me already?”</p>
<p>Shizuru simply shrugged  at me, her calm little smile evident, before she sipped at her water.</p>
<p>“It’s not like I’m  here all that often anyway…” I childishly protested.</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>Rather than explain  myself, I gave in with a sigh as I made my way back into the living  room, “I see what you mean though…I could take better care of  this place.”</p>
<p>“Then why not do it  now?” Shizuru asked, standing from her seat to walk up to me.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to  make you help me clean…”</p>
<p>“I don’t mind. Do you have any trash bags?”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Half an hour later my  entire loft was spotless with three full plastic bags sitting by the  door ready to be taken out to the dumpster. I marveled at the sight.
<p>“Huh…that didn’t  take as long as I thought it would.”</p>
<p>“See? Now we just  need to figure out what to do with <em>this</em> pile…”</p>
<p>I looked over at the  girl to see her crouching near the pile of clothes we had composed  from around the apartment, cringing when I watched her pick out a  particularly girly looking pair of panties to inspect…the newest  addition to my ever-growing collection.</p>
<p>“A-ah! Don’t touch  that!” I screeched.</p>
<p>Lunging at her, I  latched on to the piece that Shizuru has in her hands, but the girl  didn’t let go and a small-scale tug-of-war pursued.</p>
<p>“Is this Natsuki’s?”  Shizuru prodded as we continued to wrestle over the undergarment.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how or  when we etched closer to the couch, but the next thing I knew the two  of us were falling. Apparently Shizuru had stumbled back over the  armrest, and by some chance or another, pulled me down with her. The  feeling of soft warm flesh against my cheek instantly made them flare  and when I finally summoned up the courage to open my eyes, after I  had picked my head up mind you, I was met with crimson orbs that  looked just as equally shocked as mine must have appeared.</p>
<p>A deadly silence filled  the room, the only audible sound being the rain that continued to  pour outside.</p>
<p>“A-are you okay?” I  hastily questioned once I had found my voice again.</p>
<p>“Y-yeah…” Shizuru  responded somewhat shakily.</p>
<p>I oddly and clumsily  managed to roll off of her and onto the floor, sitting with my back  to her and the couch, “S-sorry about that…”</p>
<p>“It was my fault,  really…but you still haven’t answered my question…” the girl  said as she draped the item of our little tussle on my head.</p>
<p>I quickly snatched the  item.</p>
<p>“It’s part of my  collection…” I mumbled, barely audible to hear.</p>
<p>“Collection?” the  russet-eyed girl echoed, amused curiosity evident in her tone.</p>
<p>“…Yes…”</p>
<p>“You…Kuga  Natsuki…collect lingerie?”</p>
<p>“…Yes…”</p>
<p>Another spell of  silence took over the room before Shizuru spoke again, “That’s…so  cute.”</p>
<p>“Cute?!” I  practically shouted, turning to look at the girl on the couch who was  currently all smiles.</p>
<p>“It’s just…I  wouldn’t expect you of all people…” my friend tried to speak  through her laughter.</p>
<p>“S-shut up!” I  exclaimed, scampering to my feet to gather up the pile of clothes and  throw them into the washer as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Shizuru just continued  to laugh at me, “Honestly…Natsuki is just so adorable when she’s  blushing like this.”</p>
<p>Once the clothes were  safely out of sight, the sudden realization that my little secret  could be exposed causes a wave of nervousness to spread through my  entire body. Hurdling the couch, I plopped down beside the hysterical  girl, grabbing her by the shoulder with one hand and shoving the  index finger of the other over her mouth, hushing her  instantaneously.</p>
<p>“You. Can’t . Tell.  Anyone…ANYONE.”</p>
<p>The chestnut-haired  beauty just nodded stiffly, completely baffled by my sudden  seriousness.</p>
<p>“Promise me.”</p>
<p>“I promise, Natsuki,”  Shizuru swore to me, still quite perplexed by the whole thing.</p>
<p>Squinting at her  momentarily, I decided to just take her word for it, “Good.”</p>
<p>Now that that was  settled, hopefully, I returned to the kitchen, but paused before  entering to gaze out the window.</p>
<p><em>Doesn’t look like  it’s going to let up any time soon…So much for going out and  doing something...It’s probably better this way. At least at home I  know that no one’s watching. I really shouldn’t have asked  Shizuru to do anything…but…just one afternoon isn’t too much to  ask, is it? Just a little time to forget about the First District and  the Himes…</em></p>
<p>Shaking the thought and  continuing on to my original destination, I glanced at the microwave  to see that it was already past seven. I heard the television in the  living room come to life and I raised my voice slightly, “Hey, are  you hungry?”</p>
<p>“Is Natsuki offering  to make me a candle lit dinner?”</p>
<p>“Who said anything  about candles?!...I don’t think I have any anyway…” I murmurred  at the girl’s playful teasing as I looked through my cupboards.</p>
<p>“I was just kidding,”  Shizuru replied back in her singsong Kyoto accent.</p>
<p>Concluding my futile  search, I reemerged from below the counter, slamming my finds on it’s  surface, which caused Shizuru’s burgundy eyes to turn in my  direction.</p>
<p>“Peanut butter or  instant ramen, take your pick.”</p>
<p>“That’s all you  have?”</p>
<p>“That’s all I  have.”</p>
<p>Shifting on the couch,  Shizuru crossed her arms on the armrest before resting her chin on  top, a bemused little grin on her face, “I haven’t had peanut  butter in a long time.”</p>
<p>“Peanut butter it is  then,” I stated, placing the package of ramen back in the cupboard  while searching for the bread. That search didn’t last long,  however, as I quickly realized that I didn’t have any. Heck, I  barely managed to locate two spoons, which I hastily washed off,  before grabbing us both a bottle of water and lumbering back over to  the couch.</p>
<p>Falling back onto the  soft leathery cushioning with a sigh, I shoved one of the silver  utensils in Shizuru’s face, “I’m out of bread.”</p>
<p>“Seriously?” she  questioned, taking the thing from me.</p>
<p>“I don’t even have  any mayo…” I grumbled before unscrewing the lid to our pathetic  excuse of a dinner.</p>
<p>“So we’re just  going to eat it…out of the jar…?”</p>
<p>“Yep,” I curtly  responded, digging out a spoonful of the sweet substance.</p>
<p>“Is that oka—Mmf!”</p>
<p>Before she could  finish, I shoved my spoon in her mouth, effectively silencing her,  “Just eat.”</p>
<p>Shizuru began to flail  her arms as she tried to swallow the giant mass of peanut butter that  I had just lodged in her mouth, making little whiney noises the whole  time. Seeing this new side to the generally composed Kyoto native, I  immediately burst into a fit of laughter, winning a playful slap on  the arm as the girl grabbed her water off of the floor.</p>
<p>Once she had downed  some of the clear liquid, she was finally able to speak again, “Mou,  Natsuki! That wasn’t funny!”</p>
<p>Despite her words, she laughed right along with me.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
One hour, and half a  jar of peanut butter later, we were still lounging around on the  couch watching an overly cheesy game show. Natsuki and I were playing  along, and it was because of this that I came to realize that my dark  haired friend was quite the little competitor. Of course, I was not  one to lose either, so we enjoyed trying to figure out the correct  answer before the other. Eventually the show went off, which left us  channel surfing. While Natsuki was busy with the remote, I took the  chance to get up and use the restroom. When I returned, the girl was  still looking for something new to watch, and rather than sit back on  my side of the couch, I chose to snuggle right up next to her  instead.
<p>“Oi! Wha-What are you  doing, Shizuru?!”</p>
<p>“Cuddling,” I  calmly replied as I inched closer.</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, I can  see that, but…uh…why? Isn’t that something that…<em>couples</em> do?”</p>
<p>“That’s not untrue,  but friends do it as well.”</p>
<p>“Really…like two  guys would be caught doing something like <em>this</em>…” Natsuki’s  tone was quite skeptical as she shifted awkwardly.</p>
<p>I chuckled at her  words, “I didn’t say that <em>men</em> do it, but girls do every  now and then. Especially when they’re looking for someone to  consume an entire carton of cookie dough ice-cream with after they’ve  just broke up with their boyfriend.”</p>
<p>“Oh…Did you just  break up with your boyfriend?”</p>
<p>“No, baka,” I  replied, flicking her on the forehead, “I don’t have a  boyfriend…but I do have someone I like…”</p>
<p>Curiosity sparked in  her emerald eyes, “And who might that be?”</p>
<p>“Mmm…I’m not  telling.”</p>
<p>“What?! Oh, come on,  Shizuru…”</p>
<p>“Natsuki has her  secrets and I have mine.”</p>
<p>That certainly took the  steam out of her engine, and she was quiet for a moment before  finally responding.</p>
<p>“…Bah, fine…I bet  it’s Reito.”</p>
<p>Now it was my turn to  sound absolutely shocked, “What? Why him?”</p>
<p>“Well, you two are  around each other a lot because of the council…you’re both oddly  calm all the time and enjoy sipping tea and—”</p>
<p>“It’s not  Reito-san,” I interrupted her before she could continue.</p>
<p>“Then who is it? If  you don’t tell me, then I’m going to assume it is him.”</p>
<p>I wanted to yell at her  right then and there. I wanted to tell her the truth that it was <em>her</em> that I loved, but I knew I couldn’t. Not yet. Would I ever be able  to? Was there ever going to be a right time? It troubled me to think  I would never be able to tell her of my true feelings, but if that’s  what it took for us to remain friends, friends who could spend time  together like this, than I would do just that.</p>
<p>Not allowing any of my  internal debating to show through, I playfully glared at her for a  moment before speaking, “Fine. Natsuki can think what she wants,  but I know the truth.”</p>
<p>“Uh huh…” Natsuki  simply muttered, thinking she had won our little dispute.</p>
<p>“If you’re asking  me, then who is it that <em>Natsuki</em> likes?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have time  for relationships,” came the vague reply.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t mean  that you can’t like someone.”</p>
<p>“I don’t though.”</p>
<p>“What about  Takeda-kun? I hear he has a crush on a certain freshman delinquent…”</p>
<p>“That bumbling  sword-swinging idiot just gets on my nerves—Hey! Who are you  calling a delinquent?!”</p>
<p>I have to admit that I  was relieved to hear Natsuki say she wasn’t interested in anyone.  Not that it was all that hard to conclude from observation, but  hearing it from her own mouth, and the adamancy of her tone when she  said it, certainly set it in stone for me.</p>
<p>I chuckled at her  brashness, “Clearly I’m speaking of Natsuki.”</p>
<p>The emerald-eyed girl  grumbled and pouted irritably at my accusation, or maybe more at the  truthfulness of it.</p>
<p>I took the pause in  conversation to change the subject, “So, what do you want to do  now?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, I  dunno…there really isn’t too much to choose from…”</p>
<p>Glancing over at the  entertainment center, I noticed a little black device, “Is that a  Playstation?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh, yeah.”</p>
<p>“So Natsuki likes  video games?”</p>
<p>“I play when I have  the time, which isn’t that often. What about you?”</p>
<p>“I’ve never really  played any…Maybe you could teach me?”</p>
<p>“I guess. I don’t  have too many games though.”</p>
<p>“Just put something  in.”</p>
<p>“That means you’ll  have to move first…” the girl flatly stated.</p>
<p>After I reluctantly  shifted out of her way, Natsuki rose and walked over to the  television, crouching before it to set up the gaming system. Once  she’d plugged in two controllers, unrolled the cords, and placed  the disc into the device, she returned to her seat and handed me one  of the black controllers.</p>
<p>“So what are we  playing?” I inquired after taking the item from her.</p>
<p>“Soul Calibur 3. It’s  a fighting game.”</p>
<p>Natsuki tried her best  to teach me the controls, but in the end I just decide to press  whatever I deemed worthy at the moment. After I’d completed a few  warm-up matches against the computer, Natsuki and I foght against  each other. Oddly enough, I beat her on the first try…and the  second…and the third…</p>
<p>“Are you sure you  haven’t played this before?” my friend questioned me a little  harshly.</p>
<p>“I’ve never even  touch a Playstation before…Beginners luck maybe?”</p>
<p>Natsuki squinted her  eyes at me before shaking her head, “I think you’re just one of  those types who are good at whatever they do.”</p>
<p>“Is Natsuki  complimenting me?”</p>
<p>The girl blushed  slightly, “…Take it however you like, but we’re going to test  my theory first.”</p>
<p>After setting up the  game for me, Natsuki handed me her controller. I scanned through the  characters, eventually choosing a tall white-haired woman simply  because she used a weapon resembling my own element.</p>
<p>I played through the  entire story mode without dying once.</p>
<p>“Yep, I was right,”  the raven-haired girl stated while standing and stretching.</p>
<p>“I’m just pushing  buttons, Natsuki. I don’t think I’m very skilled at all,” I  retorted, placing the controller beside me on the couch.</p>
<p>“Button mashing is a  skill in itself, one you seem particularly advanced in,” my friend  pointed out, trying to sound scholarly as she strode off towards the  kitchen, stopping at the window to gaze out into the black abyss.</p>
<p>After turning off the  television, I too made my way over to the window, walking to her  side, “I can’t believe it still hasn’t stopped raining.”</p>
<p>“Mmh.”</p>
<p>A comfortable silence  filled the room as the two of us stood side by side listening to the  rain falling down, thunder roaring before our faces were illuminated  by lightning flashes.</p>
<p>Before I can even catch  it, a silent yawn slipped passed my lips. I covered my mouth with my  hand, but it wasn’t enough to fool Natsuki.</p>
<p>“Tired huh?”</p>
<p>“A little,” I  admited.</p>
<p>“I guess it is  getting kind of late…Come on, you can have my bed.”</p>
<p>Trudging up the stairs,  the girl in front of me flipped on the lamp and then continued onward  as I stopped at the bed, sitting down on the fluffy mattress.</p>
<p>“I just changed the  sheets yesterday, so they’re clean,” Natsuki informed me from her  place in the closet. When she reemerged, she was holding a blanket in  her arms, “Well, goodnight.”</p>
<p>Making her way around  the bed, she was about to turn the corner before I stopped her,  “Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“Back downstairs…”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“To sleep on the  couch,” she remarked, sounding like she was stating the obvious.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to  kick you out of your own bed.”</p>
<p>“You’re my guest.  It’s supposed to be that way.”</p>
<p>“But the couch can’t  be that comfortable…”</p>
<p>“It’s only one  night, and it’s not like I haven’t done it before.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sleeping  here if Natsuki is sleeping downstairs,” I plainly announced, no  questions asked.</p>
<p>“But—“</p>
<p>“The bed is big  enough for the both of us, you know.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but—“</p>
<p>“Isn’t it the  logical thing to do then? Unless Natsuki hates me that much…”</p>
<p>“What?! I never  said—“</p>
<p>“Then you’re  staying up here, right?”</p>
<p>Natsuki glared at me,  arguing with her eyes.</p>
<p>I answered with the  saddest looking puppy-dog eyes I could manage, and it seemed to work  as she made a gruff little noise before sitting down beside me, “This  is my side.”</p>
<p>Pleased with my work, I complied and crawled over to the other side  of the bed before slipping under the covers. The raven-haired girl  tossed the now useless blanket on the floor before doing the same.  The bed shook as she leaned over to turn off the lamp on her  nightstand, and in an instant, the room was immersed in darkness.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I don’t know when I  finally fell asleep, but the next morning when I woke up, I did so  before Natsuki. And that was probably a good thing since when I awoke  I was clinging to her body.
<p>The girl had her back  to me, and my face was buried in her shoulder blades. My left arm was  strung across her waist, the bare skin of our legs touching as my  body was formed to hers.</p>
<p>I bit my lip.</p>
<p><em>Natsuki…</em></p>
<p>I stealthily removed  myself from her, holding my breath and praying that I wouldn’t  arouse her, fearing what she would think or say if she were to know  how we had been sleeping. After I had successfully done so, I rolled  over onto my other side, looking away from her peacefully dozing  form.</p>
<p><em>Will there ever be a  day when I can wake up with you in my arms and not be afraid of your  reaction? Am I just dreaming for something that will never be?</em></p>
<p>The sound of sleepy  grumblings coming from behind me tore me from my thoughts,  “Shi..zuru…?</p>
<p>Wiping away my tears, I  composed myself before turning onto my back to look at my friend  through drowsy eyes.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Natsuki.”</p>
