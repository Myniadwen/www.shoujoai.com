<h1>A Mai HiME Fiction: Loose Threads (part 8 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/arcajeth.html">Arca Jeth</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/loosethreads-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Harada Chie loved solving puzzles. From elementary 400 piece jigsaws 
to a 10,000 piece monstrosity with only one color; blue, she loved 
the satisfaction of watching the picture come together. 

However, this current puzzle eluded her. Pieces were missing from 
the box and what pieces she had seemed to be from different puzzles 
altogether.

&quot;Tokiha Mai,&quot; Chie mused as she brushed her short, dark hair before 
her washroom mirror. &quot;Tate Yuuichi; he doesn&#39;t seem to be the type 
who&#39;d hurt a girl...&quot;

&quot;What was that?&quot; Came a call from the dorm room&#39;s kitchenette. Chie 
replaced the brush and put on her black-rimmed glasses before exiting. 

A girl of her approximate age with long, dark-brown hair was bustling 
about the kitchenette wearing a Fuuka Gakuen uniform and a pink, 
ruffled apron with the legend &quot;Kiss the Cook.&quot;

Chie, always trusting the written word did so, eliciting a smile and 
giggle from her roommate Senou Aoi. 

&quot;It&#39;s almost ready so please sit down,&quot; Aoi said.

&quot;You&#39;re in a good mood this morning,&quot; Chie said as she pulled up a 
cushion and sat at the low table. Breakfast things had already been 
set out; steamed rice, pickled daikon AND umeboshi, tamagoyaki and 
even Chie&#39;s favorite, miso soup with tofu.

&quot;Maybe I thought I&#39;d do something nice for you,&quot; Aoi replied as she 
set down the grilled fish.

&quot;Whatever I did to deserve this, remind me to keep doing it,&quot; Chie 
mused.

&quot;I will,&quot; Aoi sat across from her. &quot;Tonight.&quot; 

&quot;Itadakimasu,&quot; Chie picked up her chopsticks and took a bite, 
noticing her love&#39;s look of anticipation. She allowed the moment 
to drag out watching the expression turn into trepidation. 
&quot;Oishii,&quot; she finally said.

&quot;Thank goodness,&quot; Aoi breathed, deflating with relief. 

&quot;You have an exam coming up?&quot; the bespectacled girl asked as she ate.

&quot;Yes. Sorry for using you as a guinea pig,&quot; Aoi said with out much 
shame. &quot;So what about Tate Yuuichi?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just he doesn&#39;t seem the type to hurt a girl,&quot; Chie said as 
she dug into the pickles. &quot;But given the evidence and Mai&#39;s 
appearance Sunday night, it looks bad.&quot;

&quot;Akane-chan said she saw the two of them at the same restaurant she 
and Kazu-kun went to. So they were definitely on a date that night,&quot; 
the long-haired girl said.

Chie mulled over this while sipping her tea. It was no secret Kuga 
Natsuki had become good friends with Mai. But the only reason she 
hadn&#39;t already hunted Yuuichi down and fed him his own gonads was 
that she didn&#39;t believe it herself. So what was the true story? 

&quot;Mai-san is different too,&quot; she said aloud. &quot;She walks around 
looking depressed.&quot;

&quot;But isn&#39;t Mai the type of person who&#39;d keep smiling no matter what 
was bothering her?&quot; Aoi asked.

&quot;She used to be. But since that disturbance last year she&#39;s been 
better at showing her emotions,&quot; Chie answered. &quot;Have you had any 
luck talking to Mikoto-chan yet?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s still avoiding me,&quot; Aoi replied crestfallen. &quot;I sent her a 
text message yesterday asking her to join me for lunch but she never 
showed up.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not like Mikoto-chan to pass up free food,&quot; Chie said slowly. 
&quot;She could know something about all this.&quot;

&quot;I...don&#39;t think so,&quot; Aoi said quietly. She looked down at her hands 
and clutched at her apron. Chie reached out and took her hand into 
her own. Aoi gathered some resolve and plunged on.

&quot;Mikoto-chan&#39;s class had a study hall that afternoon,&quot; Aoi began. 
&quot;I was running some papers out to the lacrosse coach when I saw them 
behind the girls&#39; gym.&quot;

&quot;Them?&quot; Chie prompted.

&quot;Yes, Mikoto-chan and my old roommate, Yuuki Nao-chan.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Devout Christians routinely confessed their sins for absolution. 
Neither devout nor even Christian, Tokiha Mai had never felt more 
like confessing. Sister Yukariko had once explained some of it to 
her. At the time it seemed like an interesting study of religion,
however Mai never thought she&#39;d be a participant.

The small, country chapel on the Fuuka Gakuen grounds was unlike 
the gothic European monstrosities she&#39;d seen in books but it still 
intimidated her. High, stained-glass windows colored the room in 
reds, blues and greens. She came forward past the rows of pews 
where the faithful prayed. 

Yuuki Nao, the formerly prickly redhead was standing beside the 
altar where she had finished her cleaning for the day. 

&quot;Father Callahan is visiting the sick right now,&quot; she said. &quot;Is 
there anything I can do?&quot;

&quot;Only the priest can hear my confession, right?&quot; Mai said, 
disappointment in her voice.

&quot;In a formal confession, yes.&quot; Nao replied. &quot;However I can still 
listen to your problems. What&#39;s said here stays here.&quot; 

Mai stood there considering her options. The high school counselor 
seemed like a good idea now. But she had an alarming habit of 
bringing the other parties involved to &quot;talk it out,&quot; and Mai had 
absolutely no wish to confront anyone. But Nao was, for want of a 
better term morally bankrupt. Her activities with men were notorious 
at Fuuka. That put her in no position to pass judgment. 

*It might be safe to talk to her.*

Nao ushered her into a side room whose walls were lined with high 
shelves of dusty religious texts. A large, mahogany table in the 
center of the room held several leather-bound tomes with Latin 
names. The room had no windows and was lit with two shaded lamps. 

Seated at the table, Nao allowed her green eyes to pierce Mai&#39;s 
blue, reveling in the older girl&#39;s discomfort. Her eyes held an 
almost haunted quality.

&quot;It started at the HiME Festival,&quot; Mai began,&quot; but it really began 
last week.&quot;

Nao tried not to tune her out as she knew the story but not from 
this angle. 

She remembered seeing Mikoto that morning a smile like unfiltered 
sunlight on her face. Hung-over and grouchy, Nao wanted nothing more 
than to wipe that look off her classmate. Yet, when Mikoto relayed 
what Mai had done the previous night she was dumbfounded. This 
didn&#39;t sound like little-miss-perfect Tokiha Mai at all. The 
redhead still couldn&#39;t fathom why she&#39;d not blasted the girl&#39;s 
dreams right then and there. Instead she&#39;d given a gentle 
warning about expecting too much from something as nebulous as love.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know what to do next,&quot; Mai continued. &quot;I wanted to talk to 
Mikoto about it but I couldn&#39;t take the look in her eyes. I mean, 
I&#39;m not that way...I don&#39;t feel like that about other girls. It&#39;s 
just that when I looked at Mikoto...when we&#39;re together...&quot;

&quot;Forbidden fruit,&quot; Nao said with a smile. &quot;Humans always yearn for 
the thing they shouldn&#39;t have. It&#39;s the basis of our sinful nature. 
But there&#39;s something you&#39;re not telling me. A simple kiss couldn&#39;t 
be the only thing.&quot;

&quot;Y-yes,&quot; the older girl replied anxiously. &quot;That day I told Mikoto 
to come back to our room at 8:00 to talk. After that I called Yuuichi.&quot;

Mai looked at the table, drops of her tears began to collect on the 
dark surface. 

&quot;How much did she see?&quot; Although she knew the story well Nao, felt her 
hands clenching, fingernails biting into her palms. 

&quot;I just wanted to set her free!&quot; Mai cried. &quot;I thought if I could do 
that things would go back to normal. That Mikoto would understand 
that it was just a stupid mistake!&quot;

Mai finally broke down sobbing pitifully. 

&quot;You let her see the two of you together,&quot; Nao supplied and Mai could 
only nod.

&quot;The look on her face,&quot; Mai sobbed. &quot;She wasn&#39;t even angry. I actually 
saw what it looks like when someone&#39;s heart breaks.&quot;

As Mai doubled over with grief, Nao stood, rounded the table and 
gently pulled the older girl&#39;s head into an embrace.

&quot;Your sins are heavy but all is not lost,&quot; she said quietly. 
&quot;There is something you can do to atone.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Mai&#39;s voice held the slightest trace of fragile 
hope. However, the expression on her confessor&#39;s face would have 
frozen her to the core had she seen it.

Yuuki Nao smiled and answered: &quot;Penance.&quot;
