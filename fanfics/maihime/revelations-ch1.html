<h1>Revelations</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>(with assistance from Dan and Strife)

&quot;What do you mean, I&#39;m DEAD?&quot; Mai Tokiha blurted out, the orange-haired 
young woman gazing at her friend in surprise.

With a sigh Natsuki Kuga pushed her glasses up, her long black hair tied 
back in a ponytail. &quot;As far as I can tell,&quot; she looked at Mai with 
sympathy, her lab coat fluttering over her usual street clothes.

&quot;But Mai can&#39;t be dead,&quot; Mikoto Minagi blinked in surprise as the small 
black haired lady shook her head, &quot;she&#39;s right here.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s got to be a mistake,&quot; Mai said quietly, leaning up against 
Mikoto for support in the small office.

Natsuki Kuga sighed, sitting back in her office at Fuka. She was a 
professor now as well as a respected researcher, and while her primary 
area of study was physics she had also been looking into the Hime. &quot;It&#39;s 
complicated,&quot; Natsuki said wryly.

&quot;We&#39;ve got time,&quot; Mai said, unconsciously reaching out for Mikoto&#39;s hand 
and squeezing it for comfort.

&quot;What my equipment tells me is that your body isn&#39;t real,&quot; Natsuki 
explained, &quot;it&#39;s energy...just shaped like a human being.&quot; She took off 
her glasses to rub at her eyes, &quot;I even think I know when it 
happened...&quot;

&quot;Tell us,&quot; Mikoto said, putting a comforting arm around Mai&#39;s shoulders.

Mai smiled up at Mikoto in gratitude. With everything that had happened, 
from Yuichi leaving her to all of this, the other woman had been a rock 
for Mai to lean on. &quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; she met Natsuki&#39;s eyes.

&quot;When Alyssa Searrs attacked the academy with her orbital weapon 
Artemis, you used Kagutsuchi to stop it,&quot; Natsuki said gently, &quot;and I 
think you died there...I saw you come back together out of the flames.&quot;

&quot;Someone didn&#39;t think to tell me that?&quot; Mai slumped in a chair, looking 
at both of them in frank disbelief

&quot;We were a little busy at the time,&quot; Natsuki said, the scientist holding 
up her hands defensively.

&quot;And you did rocket off into space right afterward,&quot; Mikoto added 
reasonably, looking down at her mildly.

&quot;Then you reappeared on campus days later with no explanation where you 
went,&quot; Natsuki added pointedly.

&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Mai gave in. &quot;If I AM energy,&quot; Mai looked down at her 
hands weakly, &quot;how am I still looking human?&quot;

&quot;We think it&#39;s by your will, assisted by our Hime ability to materialize 
energy,&quot; Natsuki stated, &quot;operating on a massive scale.&quot; She searched 
her desk for a moment while adding, &quot;I&#39;m going to contact 
Sugiura-sensei; she might have some information too.&quot;

&quot;But I thought we lost our Hime abilities when the Childe and our Hime 
marks disappeared,&quot; Mai pounced on that.

&quot;That&#39;s what I thought, too,&quot; Natsuki looked very annoyed at the idea 
she&#39;d been tricked. &quot;I may have to try to track down Fumi Himeko; she 
knew Nagi and Mashiro best, and might have the answers we seek.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll help,&quot; Mai scowled.

&quot;Me too,&quot; Mikoto nodded. &quot;Is that also why Mai hasn&#39;t aged?&quot; Mikoto 
asked softly, looking at Natsuki with a odd sort of intensity.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Natsuki agreed. &quot;It has to do with body image, we think.&quot;

&quot;Guess that explains why my breasts never sagged, too,&quot; Mai muttered 
under her breath.

&quot;I know this is a lot for you to take in,&quot; Natsuki said softly as she 
reached out to squeeze Mai&#39;s hand, &quot;you&#39;ll need time, I think.&quot;

&quot;You got that right,&quot; Mai sighed.

&quot;If you want to you&#39;re welcome to come visit Shizuru and I,&quot; Natsuki 
offered, her smile unusually warm.

&quot;Fujino-san finally wore you down?&quot; Mikoto asked with a smile.

Mai smiled, silently thanking Mikoto for changing the subject. &quot;Yeah, I 
thought you were going to hold out forever,&quot; Mai teased.

&quot;Oh shut up,&quot; Natsuki complained. She blushed, &quot;I was just concerned how 
it would look, having the Headmaster of Fuka living with a professor.&quot;

&quot;And your shyness had nothing to do with it?&quot; Mikoto teased, remembering 
how Shiziru&#39;s intense pursuit had embarrassed Natsuki.

&quot;Don&#39;t start,&quot; Natsuki scowled.

&quot;Thanks for the offer,&quot; Mai rose, &quot;but I think I&#39;ll head home.&quot; She 
smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;m just lucky I have a few days off from the restaurant 
I manage.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll stay with her,&quot; Mikoto said to Natsuki softly as they left the 
office.

&quot;She&#39;s lucky to have you around,&quot; Natsuki said as she watched her go.

&quot;Mai,&quot; Mikoto smiled as she caught up with her, both walking away from 
the facility building on the Fuka campus.

&quot;Thanks for coming,&quot; Mai smiled as she took Mikoto&#39;s hand, &quot;from the 
tone of Natsuki&#39;s voice I knew it was bad...&quot;

&quot;I wanted to be here anyway,&quot; Mikoto answered firmly.

&quot;I guess that&#39;s what I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Mai looked up at Mikoto 
questioningly. &quot;I turned from you to Yuichi, did my best to forget about 
what we shared...why did you come help me now?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Because I love you,&quot; Mikoto shrugged casually. She smiled, &quot;I accepted 
you loved Yuichi, eventually, and I was happy just to be with you as a 
friend.&quot; A grin, &quot;And I left on my own, as I recall.&quot;

&quot;Maybe, but I certainly gave you a push,&quot; Mai sighed. She stopped them 
by one of the trees in the gardens, cherry blossoms falling all around 
them. &quot;I...don&#39;t know how I feel, Mikoto, and I can&#39;t promise you 
anything,&quot; she said.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t want you to,&quot; Mikoto reached out to gently put her hand to 
Mai&#39;s cheek.

Mai unconsciously tilted her head, rubbing her cheek against Mikoto&#39;s 
hand. The sword calluses were oddly comforting against her skin, a 
familiar sensation. &quot;I do know that I want to be close to you,&quot; she 
said, &quot;and see where it goes.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that very much,&quot; Mikoto smiled as they walked off hand in 
hand. &quot;Hey Mai?&quot; she asked a few moments later.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Mai asked curiously.

A soft rumbling was heard. &quot;I&#39;m hungry,&quot; Mikoto confessed sheepishly.

&quot;You never change,&quot; Mai laughed, hugging her.

End

Notes: Inspired by images from Mai Hime, especially the scene where Mai 
appears to die then pulls herself together out of the flames. This story 
will be added to in one of my other series, but I&#39;m not quite sure which 
one... lol.</pre>
