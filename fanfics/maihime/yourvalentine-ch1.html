<p>A Place to Call Home</p><hr>Natsuki paused as she
reached Shizuru’s front door. She could have simply used her key to
get in – in fact, she’d already used her garage key so she could
store her bike in there – but she wanted to do this properly.
Simply walking in through the door just didn’t seem as romantic as
letting Shizuru answer it and find her waiting there, a box of
chocolates in her hand.<p>Of course, the flip
side was that it made Natsuki feel childish and awkward. Being
romantic like this just wasn’t her thing, and if anyone ever asked
about this, she’d deny, deny, and deny some more. There was only
one person Kuga Natsuki would ever do something like this for, or
even admit to doing something like this to: Fujino Shizuru. There was
just something about the way Shizuru reacted that made embarrassing
herself like this alright. She loved the little romantic things in
their own rights, but Natsuki figured that it was the fact that she
was actually doing them that pushed Shizuru over the edge.</p><p>It turned out to be
surprisingly easy to make her girlfriend blush when she applied
herself and did a little something extra that she wouldn’t normally
do. Shizuru was always gorgeous when she blushed, and Natsuki was
starting to get an idea of why she always enjoyed provoking this
reaction in her. Of course, in Natsuki’s case, Shizuru claimed that
blushing made her cute – a thought which tended to make her
blushing even worse – but the important part was that Shizuru
enjoyed it.</p><p><i>The important part
is that Shizuru enjoys it,</i> Natsuki repeated to herself. This part
of her plans was likely to be one of the easiest parts, modesty-wise.
She unconsciously shifted the duffel bag which hug from her shoulder,
trying not to think of the change of clothing and other supplies
inside too much. She’d have plenty of time to worry about that
later, and it would hopefully be easier then, after she’d seen
Shizuru and they’d spent a little time together. It was always hard
to think of the more intimate things she and Shizuru had taken to
doing in the last couple of months when she wasn’t in the mood, but
a little physical contact from Shizuru and all the other soothing
aspects of her presence made it not only alright, but something
Natsuki desperately wanted.</p><p>Deciding she’d
hesitated long enough, Natsuki reached out to ring Shizuru’s
doorbell. Music rang from inside, slightly muffled. Shizuru had
changed the bell sound to something more personal not long after
moving into this house. It sounded like some kind of enka music to
Natsuki, though she couldn’t figure out which song in particular.
When asked about it, Shizuru had always just told her that it was
something personal, and eventually Natsuki had given up. It had been
over a month now since she’d bothered with the doorbell, so she
hadn’t thought about it for a while. Maybe now that she and Shizuru
were opening up with each other more, she’d be willing to explain
the significance behind the song. Natsuki reminded herself to ask
about it later.</p><p>Shizuru took longer to
reach the door than Natsuki had expected. She’d figured that
Shizuru would have heard the garage open and close and would have
guessed at her intentions. Perhaps she hadn’t, or perhaps she was
just pretending she hadn’t. Or, most likely, it was just one of her
many ways of teasing Natsuki. Well, if she was trying to make her
anxious, Natsuki didn’t plan to fall into that trap. She’d be
smooth, confident, and romantic.</p><p>Natsuki held her
heart-shaped box of chocolates out and allowed a loving grin to cross
her face just as the door swung open. “Happy Valentine’s Day!”
she said just as Shizuru came into view, then promptly considered
herself lucky she’d said it then. The sight of Shizuru left her
breathless. She was wearing one of her favorite kimonos, a pale
purple number adorned by various flowers, with her hair worn back
fashionably. She was the perfect picture of the traditionally elegant
Japanese woman.</p><p>Natsuki’s thoughts
started drifting in the direction of feeling bad that she’d put
less effort into her outfit than Shizuru, wearing only her casual
clothing beneath her jacket, but the look on Shizuru’s face pushed
those thoughts from her mind. Shizuru couldn’t have cared less
about what Natsuki was wearing. Her face lit up beautifully when she
observed Natsuki. She wore a smile that was reserved specifically for
these moments, and it never failed to send a wave of warmth through
Natsuki’s chest as she realized how special she was to Shizuru.</p><p>“Good evening,
Natsuki,” Shizuru said, bowing politely. She was trying to be
formal, but Natsuki sensed something in her voice that sounded a bit
off. The devil’s advocate in her head suspected that Shizuru was
repressing a “So cute!” reaction, but she tried not to pay it
much mind lest she spontaneously break out into a blush. “Please
come in,” Shizuru continued, politely moving to the side and
motioning for Natsuki to enter. The undercurrent in her voice seemed
to have intensified now, but Natsuki ignored it and made her way
inside.</p><p>Natsuki dropped the
chocolates and her duffel bag off on a nearby table as she made her
way to the coat closet. She kicked off her shoes, and then said as
she removed her coat, “Er, sorry I didn’t dress up any more
Shizuru. I would’ve if I’d known you were going to.”</p><p>“It’s alright,
Natsuki,” Shizuru said from behind her, and Natsuki could hear the
smile in her girlfriend’s voice. It had softened a little from the
formal tone she’d put on before. “I wouldn’t mind even if
Natsuki came here wearing nothing at all.”</p><p>Natsuki’s face lit up
in a blush before she could push the thought of standing naked at
Shizuru’s doorstep out of her mind. <i>Damn it! It didn’t take
her thirty seconds from me getting in the door to make me blush. At
least I’ve got my back turned to her…</i> Natsuki had hoped that
she’d develop a resistance to Shizuru’s teasing once they started
going out, but she’d had no such luck. Maybe on some level she just
didn’t want to. Teasing was, after all, one of Shizuru’s ways of
showing her love, and so it did cause a little throbbing in her heart
whenever Natsuki was the subject of it.</p><p>Natsuki rapidly shook
those thoughts from her head and hung up her coat. She was not going
to admit to enjoying Shizuru’s teasing. <i>Because then it’d stop
working so we- No! You shut up! I get enough teasing from Shizuru, I
don’t need my own subconscious joini-</i> “Ahh!” Natsuki let
out a yelp and stumbled forwards as Shizuru practically pounced on
her from behind. Her girlfriend’s arms wrapped around her securely,
though, one across her shoulders and the other below her breasts, and
held her up.</p><p>“Now what isn’t
okay,” Shizuru said into Natsuki’s ear in a teasingly upset tone,
“is to try to hide one of my rightfully-earned blushes from me. And
this is after you decided to come in through the front door so I
couldn’t hug you like this as soon you as you entered. Natsuki no
ikezu.”</p><p>As
she regained her balance, Natsuki relaxed into the hug and started to
giggle at Shizuru’s antics. Even in a kimono, she could be as silly
as ever. It was really endearing, actually. Shizuru was the perfect
mix of elegance and playfulness, and displays like this just
emphasized it in Natsuki’s mind. A wave of love for Shizuru taking
over her, Natsuki leaned her head back and turned it to the side,
allowing her lips to meet Shizuru’s in a tender kiss.</p><p>Shizuru wasn’t
expecting the kiss, but she certainly didn’t complain. She let out
a slight yelp of pleasant surprise as Natsuki’s lips met hers, but
she quickly returned the kiss. Her lips moved slowly and gently
against Natsuki’s. They’d have plenty of time for passionate
kisses later; for now they were both simply content with allowing
their kiss to be sweet and gentle.</p><p>Natsuki found herself
melting into Shizuru’s arms as their embrace continued. Her hands
drifted up to lie on top of Shizuru’s, holding them against her
body. It felt like Shizuru’s love was washing through her body,
filling her with a pleasant warmth. She weakened in her lover’s
arms, and she tried to let her own love pour out through her kiss so
Shizuru could feel the same way. This feeling, this moment was
absolute bliss. She’d been an idiot to hold back for so long. Why
was she ever afraid of feeling like this?</p><p>Remembered excuses
drifted up in Natsuki’s mind: She’d been afraid of loving because
she’d been afraid of being abandoned again. But it had finally
occurred to her that Shizuru wasn’t going away, whether or not her
love was returned. That realization had made it alright for her to
examine her own feelings and acknowledge that she felt something more
than friendship for Shizuru.</p><p>That realization, along
with a few fantasies that started haunting her dreams, had led to an
embarrassing attempt at a birthday present for Shizuru, followed
eventually by a much more satisfactory – for both of them –
Christmas. Time would tell how well her planned Valentine’s Day
present would turn out. At least, now that she was with Shizuru, she
felt like she might have enough courage to go through with it.</p><p>But that was too far in
the future. Natsuki was content just enjoying the moment with Shizuru
for now. She gently withdrew from the kiss and gave Shizuru a smile.
“I love you, Shizuru,” she said.</p><p>The reaction on her
girlfriend’s face was just as sweet as every time Natsuki uttered
those words. There was a small amount of disbelief, as if she still
couldn’t quite believe this was really happening. Also present was
a kind-of “I don’t deserve this” expression, which Natsuki
heartily disagreed with. But most prominent was the simple happiness,
which was always enough to express itself through teardrops forming
in Shizuru’s eyes. Sniffing back the tears, Shizuru said, “I love
you too, Natsuki. Happy Valentine’s Day.”</p><p>Natsuki briefly mused
that she didn’t have such a beautiful reaction typically to
Shizuru’s professions of love, and a wave of guilt struck her for a
moment. She felt something, certainly. Ever since she’d figured out
her own feelings, Shizuru’s professions had meant a bit more to
Natsuki, and she felt a sweet pang in her heart with every one. It
was just too bad Shizuru couldn’t see that reaction in her.</p><p>On the other hand,
Shizuru did get plenty of fun making Natsuki blush with her teasing,
so maybe it evened out in the end. With that though, a wicked idea
struck Natsuki. If she were to start blushing at Shizuru’s
admissions of love, she might lighten up on the teasing in favor of
that. She would never get completely free of blushing around her
girlfriend, but perhaps she could at least get out of some of the
teasing. The trick was getting herself to blush at the right time.</p><p>“Natsuki is so cute
when she’s lost in thought,” Shizuru said, breaking Natsuki out
of her reverie and sending a blush quickly to her cheeks.</p><p>Natsuki let out a
mental sigh. <i>Guess that’s it then. When she says “I love you,”
I’ll just have to mentally add on “Natsuki is so cute.” I just
hope I’ll be able to take it.</i></p><p>“So what was Natsuki
thinking about?” Shizuru asked when it was clear that Natsuki was
remaining silent.</p><p>Natsuki twisted in
Shizuru’s embrace and freed an arm. She playfully tapped a finger
to Shizuru’s nose and put on a fake scowl. “You. And how much you
always torment me.”</p><p>Shizuru got back at her
by leaning forward and standing on her toes slightly so she could
land a kiss on Natsuki’s nose. “You know you love it, and I know
too. I wouldn’t do it otherwise.”</p><p><i>Damn you.</i>

Natsuki was really at a loss in their arguments ever since Shizuru
had dragged that little secret out of her during their first night
together. She let out a soft growl as she pushed out of the hug,
trying to think of something to change the subject. She found one
when her eyes landed on the box of chocolates she’d brought for
Shizuru. She went over to retrieve them.</p><p>“Er, anyways,
Shizuru, I got you these for Valentine’s Day,” Natsuki said as
she picked up the box and turned around. She presented the box to
Shizuru. “I know how much of a sweet tooth you have, however much
you try to hide it from others.”</p><p>Shizuru’s eyes showed
a brief flicker of surprise as she took the box from Natsuki. “How
did Natsuki find out…?” she asked cautiously.</p><p>Natsuki smiled
victoriously. It wasn’t often she caught Shizuru off-guard, and she
planned to relish it. She kept Shizuru waiting for a moment before
she explained, “I’ve spent the night here plenty of times, and
made myself breakfast on a couple of occasions when I woke up before
you. In searching for mayo – which by the way, you’re out of as
of last Thursday – I found your secret stash.” Putting on her
best imitation of Shizuru’s accent, Natsuki said, “It seems that
tea isn’t the only thing Shizuru’s addicted to.”</p><p>A blush alit on
Shizuru’s face, and she dropped her gaze down from Natsuki. After a
minute, she let out a sigh and put on a smile. “Ara, I guess you
caught me.” Natsuki’s victory smile widened. “But there is one
thing Natsuki should be warned about. When I eat chocolate, I get a
little…”</p><p>“Frisky?” Natsuki
supplied, taking a step closer to Shizuru. The blush on her
girlfriend’s face deepened. She tried to make her voice as alluring
as possible, though she didn’t have much practice with it, and so
she wasn’t really sure if she was succeeding. “Aroused?”
Another step, an even deeper blush on Shizuru. “Wanting to do some
very naughty things to your girlfriend?”</p><p>Shizuru’s blush now
rivaled some of the best she’d ever provoked in Natsuki. Seeing if
she could actually top Shizuru, Natsuki pressed one step further. She
reached a hand up to gently stroke along Shizuru’s arm, feeling the
soft fabric of the kimono and Shizuru’s even softer flesh beneath
it. “I was counting on it,” Natsuki finished, looking coyly up
into Shizuru’s eyes.</p><p>A weak whimper came
from Shizuru, and she seemed to burst a blood vessel in her cheek.
Natsuki briefly considered pushing her even further with a sweet “I
love you,” but she figured Shizuru had had enough. She didn’t
have the practice to keep up these big blushes, after all. So Natsuki
calmly waited until Shizuru’s blush had settled down enough for the
girl to get out a soft, “Natsuki’s going to pay for this.”</p><p>Natsuki couldn’t help
herself as she broke out into laughter. Shizuru would always be
Shizuru, even right after she’d been defeated. Giving her lover a
quick kiss on the nose, much as she’d received earlier, Natsuki
said, “Don’t worry, I’ve got that planned out too.” Before
Shizuru could question her on this, Natsuki continued, poking the box
of chocolates with her finger, “Now eat! I bought those for you; I
want you to enjoy them.”</p><p>“Yes, cuddlebunny,”
Shizuru said, catching Natsuki off-guard with the use of that
nickname and prompting a blush in her. Shizuru made her way to the
kitchen as she opened up the box, leaving Natsuki to lament letting
her guard down. She only wasted a few moments on it, though. It was
inevitable with Shizuru, so there was no point in fretting over it.
Shaking her head, Natsuki followed Shizuru into the kitchen and sat
down across from her at the table. She simply watched Shizuru as she
ate, marveling at how the girl still managed to seem perfectly
elegant as she did so. The woman was truly inhuman.</p><p><i>That’s it then.
She isn’t human. She’s a goddess.</i> My<i> goddess.</i> A smile
came unbidden to Natsuki’s face as she watched Shizuru. She idly
wondered the object of her affection was currently thinking about.
She certainly didn’t mind just standing there watching her – it
was hard to imagine a more beautiful sight then Shizuru in one of her
best kimonos – but perhaps Shizuru was getting a bit bored. She
wasn’t showing it, but it was always hard to tell with her.</p><p>“Ara, Natsuki is
looking hungry herself,” Shizuru said, drawing Natsuki out of her
thoughts. She quirked an eyebrow at her girlfriend, causing Natsuki
to think that she might have intended a different meaning by
“hungry.” “Perhaps I could share a few of these lovely treats
with her.”</p><p>“Hmm? No!” Natsuki
protested. “I got those for you!”</p><p>“Yes, and the best
thing I can think of to do with them on Valentine’s Day is to share
them with Natsuki.” Shizuru pushed the box across the table so it
was halfway between her and Natsuki. Natsuki noticed that it was
already half empty. Time must have really flown by while she was
watching Shizuru. “Besides,” Shizuru continued, a sparkle forming
in her eye. “I wouldn’t want to be the only one affected by
them.”</p><p>“Hmm, well alright,”
Natsuki said, picking a piece out of the box. “But so you know,
chocolate really doesn’t do it for me like that.” Natsuki popped
the piece into her mouth and chewed into it. She’d been sure to
pick out quality sweets for Shizuru, and she was glad to confirm that
they were indeed quite delicious.</p><p>“Well I guess I’ll
just have to do something else to get Natsuki in the mood,” Shizuru
said. Her mouth managed to maintain a mischievous grin even as she
placed a chocolate into it and started chewing. Natsuki reaffirmed
her prior observation that Shizuru was inhuman. Shizuru swallowed the
chocolate and said, “Fortunately, I do have a couple of things
planned. Natsuki might not be easy to get into the mood, but she does
have her tricks.”</p><p>A slight blush made its
way to Natsuki’s cheeks. The thought that Shizuru was learning how
to get her into the mood best might have sent her running for the
hills a couple months ago, but it was only mildly embarrassing now.
When she was honest with herself, it wasn’t getting into the mood
that frightened her, it was thinking about going ahead with things
when she wasn’t ready for it. If Shizuru was to make sure she got
Natsuki appropriately aroused first, then that was alright, wasn’t
it? No need to worry about her modesty causing her to scream and run.
The problem was trusting Shizuru to do that. She’d likely push
things every once in a while just for the reaction.</p><p>“Hmm… I think
Natsuki’s redder…”</p><p>“What?” Natsuki
broke out of her thoughts to focus on Shizuru. Her girlfriend had a
cherry-filled chocolate held up in front of her, half of it bitten
off. She kept glancing between it and Natsuki’s face.</p><p>“Oh yes, definitely
Natsuki. She’s much cuter, too.” With a small grin, Shizuru
tossed the chocolate into her mouth while a very red Natsuki fumed at
her from across the table.</p><p>“Baka,” Natsuki
spat back. It wasn’t much of a comeback, really. More of an
admission of defeat, in her own way. She indignantly leaned back in
her chair and grabbed a chocolate. She popped it into her mouth and
chewed as angrily as she could, resulting only in an amused giggle
from Shizuru. Despite herself, Natsuki ended up admiring the
beautiful sound of her girlfriend’s laughter.</p><p>“So tell me,
Natsuki,” Shizuru said as her laughter subsided. “How did you
figure out what chocolate does to me? I don’t think just snooping
around my kitchen could clue you in to that.”</p><p>Natsuki chuckled. “I’ve
got my secrets.” Taking a chocolate from the box, she tossed it
into her mouth and chewed in as coy a manner as she could manage.</p><p>Of course, when it 
came
to manipulative facial expressions, Shizuru was the master. Right
now, she put on a pathetic pout and whined, “Natsuki’s been
keeping secrets from me?”</p><p>Natsuki could not help
but stare back into Shizuru’s eyes. She’d opened them wide,
pleading with Natsuki. A bolt of pain hit Natsuki’s heart seeing
Shizuru like this. She was almost positive it was just an act, but it
still hurt. Giving a frustrated sigh, Natsuki gave in. “Fine, fine.
You talk in your sleep.”</p><p>Shizuru’s pout
vanished in an instant, confirming Natsuki’s suspicions that it was
an act. It was replaced by a somewhat surprised and nervous look.
“What do I say?” she asked.</p><p>Natsuki chuckled. It
was quite fun being able to twist Shizuru around her finger like
this, if only for a moment. Of course, she knew if she held out too
long, Shizuru would deploy her pout again. Rather than facing assured
defeat, she decided to show mercy on her girlfriend. “Mostly you
seem to be talking to me, and I seem to be quite a tease in your
dreams, judging by all the ‘Ikezus’ I hear.” Shizuru’s cheeks
tinged pink, and Natsuki knew that she’d guessed correctly. “I’ve
also picked up a few other things, such as what chocolate does to
you.” <i>What exactly I heard you say… well, maybe I’ll tell
you later tonight. Er, after I show you…</i></p><p>“Yup, Natsuki’s
definitely redder.” Natsuki glared at Shizuru, finding that she’d
picked out another cherry-filled chocolate and was doing her
comparison again. Of course, this only served to make Natsuki’s
blush worse. “So tell me, Natsuki, are the things I say in my sleep
so embarrassing to you that just thinking of them turns you into a
cherry? I just might have to record myself in my sleep for some
ideas.”</p><p>Natsuki let out an
exasperated sigh. She really had to stop doing that to herself.
Shizuru should at least have to work to make her blush. She silently
ate down a couple more chocolates, until she and Shizuru had emptied
out the box, just about at the same time her blush completely faded.
Natsuki made quite sure that Shizuru didn’t get her hands on any
more cherry-filled chocolates, lest she pull her comparison again.</p><p>“Now,” Shizuru
said, standing up from the table. Natsuki looked up into her
girlfriend’s eyes and noticed that a fire seemed to be lit in them.
“Before I end up pouncing on Natsuki, I think I’d better give her
her present. Come,” Shizuru walked past Natsuki, out into the
hallway, motioning for her to follow. Cautiously, Natsuki got up and
followed her. She cast a glance back to the box of chocolates which
was still lying on the table, marveling at how anxious she must have
made Shizuru for her to give up being circumspect about throwing the
box away.</p><p>Natsuki met Shizuru out
in the hallway. She was standing next to the doorway to her guest
room. The door was shut, as usual. Natsuki had taken a peek in many
months back when she’d first come over to Shizuru’s place, but
she’d never given the room much mind since then. She’d noticed
that in the past month, the door to it seemed to be closed all the
time, but she didn’t think too much on it. Judging by Shizuru’s
presence in front of the door now, Natsuki mused that she must have
stashed her gift in that room. If she’d bought it a while back, it
could explain why she’d kept the door closed lately.</p><p>“I have to say,”
Shizuru said, “It took me some work to figure out what to get you
today. I’ve actually been thinking about this for quite a while. I
do know a lot about what you like, but none of that is really
romantic enough for Valentine’s Day. You kind of lucked out when
you found out about my chocolate addiction. But, I did come up with
something which I think will be just perfect for you.”</p><p>Natsuki furrowed her
brow as she tried to guess what Shizuru might have gotten her. In the
end though, she was at as complete a loss as Shizuru must have been
when she’d first tried to think up a gift idea. She gave an
exaggerated shrug. “Alright, I give up. What did you get me?”</p><p>Shizuru smiled and let
out a lovely chuckle. “Well it occurred to me that whenever we
sleep together, Natsuki is quite a cuddlebunny.” Natsuki was able
to steel herself this time to prevent a blush. Shizuru gave a little
pout at her failure but continued, “Well, I got to worrying about
how Natsuki fares when I’m not there for her. I just can’t
imagine her cuddliness disappearing, and I can’t bear the thought
of her being deprived. So…”</p><p>Shizuru snuck in behind
the door, making sure Natsuki couldn’t see past it as she went into
the room. As she waited for Shizuru to reappear, Natsuki wondered
about what her girlfriend might have gotten her to cuddle with. Most
of the time when she wasn’t with Shizuru, she’d wake up to find
herself clutching her pillow in her arms. It was far from a perfect
solution, though. The pillow just wasn’t solid enough, and using it
deprived her head of something to lie on.</p><p>It occurred to Natsuki
that this was something she really should be getting embarrassed and
blushing about. Shizuru hadn’t just mentioned her being cuddly, but
had even gotten her a present with that in mind. It should have had
her blushing and groaning at the experience, but she really didn’t
seem to mind. She must have changed lately, if she was alright with
all of this. It was a bit disconcerting to think that she’d changed
in this manner, but it also seemed she’d lost the fiercer side to
her personality that would have gotten really upset about it. <i>I
guess it makes some sort of sense. After the Carnival, we’ve all
gone back to normal lives, and I guess I’m softening. Shizuru’s
probably to blame for a lot of it, too.</i></p><p>“Alright Natsuki,”
Shizuru’s voice came from behind the door. “Close your eyes and
open your arms.” Sighing and rolling her eyes, Natsuki obeyed.
“Ready?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Natsuki
said. She silently hoped she wouldn’t end up getting pounced on
again by Shizuru, but that didn’t seem too likely.</p><p>Natsuki heard the
sounds of the door opening and closing, along with Shizuru’s
footsteps. She sensed a presence in front of her, and Shizuru said,
“Now hug.” Rolling her eyes behind her closed eyelids, Natsuki
wrapped her arms closed. They circled around a large stuffed body.
Moving her arms around, Natsuki tried to gauge its shape. It seemed
to be some animal, judging by what seemed to be limbs at the top and
bottom. It would certainly be good for cuddling. It was just firm
enough for her hug to have some presence, but soft enough to be
comfortable. <i>Just like Shizuru…</i></p><p>“Can I open my eyes
now?” Natsuki asked.</p><p>“First you have to
guess what it is,” Shizuru said.</p><p>Natsuki felt up the
stuffed animal a bit more, feeling the head a bit more this time. A
couple of floppy ears clinched her conclusion. Allowing a smile to
cross her face, she said, “It’s Duran.” She opened her eyes to
find herself face to face with a dog’s head. To be honest, aside
from the blue color, it didn’t look a thing like Duran, but that
wasn’t important. It would be her new Duran, and that was what
mattered.</p><p>Natsuki was distracted
from her new companion by the sound of Shizuru chuckling delightedly.
“My thoughts exactly,” she said. “I take it Natsuki likes him?
Enough to cuddle with him when I’m not around?”</p><p>“Hmm…” Natsuki
considered this for a minute. It certainly would be better than using
her pillow, that wasn’t in question. It was just that her pride had
finally caught up to her and she was once more concerned about
admitting to needing something to cuddle with. When she glanced over
at Shizuru though, she decided that some things were more important
than her pride. “Well, he’s no comparison to you, but I think
he’ll do.”</p><p>A blush made its way to
Shizuru’s cheeks at Natsuki’s comment. That wasn’t really
surprising – it was hard to make Shizuru blush, but Natsuki knew
that would do it. What was surprising was that Shizuru seemed to
become a bit nervous. It was possible that the nervousness had been
there before Natsuki’s comment, but she still couldn’t think of
any reason for it. Shizuru quickly covered it up, though. “I’m
glad Natsuki likes him.”</p><p>Natsuki dropped Duran
down a bit in her arms so she could look over at him and at Shizuru a
bit better. Something was up, and she wasn’t going to let it drop.
“What’s up, Shizuru? You looked nervous for a moment there.”</p><p>Shizuru’s mask seemed
to break when Natsuki pointed this out. She gave a somewhat weak
smile as she said, “Well, that wasn’t my only gift for Natsuki. I
was just thinking about what else I’ve gotten you.”</p><p>“And you’re nervous
about that?” Natsuki said. She had to put up a bit of a mask of her
own as she said this. She was desperately trying not to think about
her own other gift for Shizuru. That was definitely something to be
nervous about. Was Shizuru planning something similar? That would
give her grounds to be nervous, but it might be a bit awkward if they
both did the same thing.</p><p>Shizuru nodded. “I’m
afraid I… I’m not sure Natsuki’s ready for this,” she said.
Natsuki remarked that Shizuru must truly have been nervous. For her
normal grace to break like that, she’d have to be.</p><p>Natsuki gently placed
Duran down on the floor and walked over to Shizuru. She reached out
to take Shizuru’s hand in hers. “Don’t worry, Shizuru. To be
honest, I’ve surprised myself with what I’m ready for.” She
looked up to catch Shizuru’s gaze and held it as confidently as she
could. She didn’t know what Shizuru might have planned, but she did
know that she was ready to accept anything of this girl. Ever since
she and Shizuru had officially become a couple, things had just
started to feel right in her life. Whatever Shizuru wanted to do with
her tonight, she was ready for it. She might have to fight through
her modesty to do it, but Shizuru was worth it.</p><p>Shizuru nodded
slightly. She still looked nervous, but she seemed to have decided to
go through with this. “Alright,” she said. She clutched Natsuki’s
hand and brought it up to her mouth for a quick kiss. “Just promise
me you’ll consider it, okay Natsuki?”</p><p>“Of course, Shizuru,”
Natsuki said, silently wondering what Shizuru might have in mind that
she could be so nervous about. Particularly if it were intended as a
gift, she shouldn’t have much reason to refuse, should she? Well,
she’d just have to wait and see.</p><p>“Okay,” Shizuru
said. “Close your eyes again.”</p><p>Natsuki gave her
girlfriend a blank expression at this. Wasn’t once enough?</p><p>“Please?” Shizuru
said, giving Natsuki an irresistible pleading expression. Sighing,
Natsuki relented. She hadn’t really expected to win anyways. “Thank
you.” As expected, Shizuru’s voice immediately perked up. She
guided Natsuki towards the door to the guest room and opened it up in
front of her. Natsuki cautiously walked inside, still trying to
figure out what Shizuru might have planned.</p><p>Natsuki heard Shizuru
walk around behind her to close the door. Shizuru took a deep breath
and nervously said, “Alright Natsuki. You can open your eyes now.”</p><p>It took Natsuki a 
few
seconds to figure out what she was supposed to be looking at once she
opened her eyes. She’d been expecting some obvious present in the
middle of the room, or possibly Shizuru having done a quick change
into some alluring outfit. There was none of that here, though, just
the room. <i>The room…</i></p><p>Natsuki looked more
closely at the room itself and compared it to the brief glimpses
she’d gotten before Shizuru had closed it off. The walls had gone
from white to a soothing blue, and the bed seemed to have been
replaced completely; it looked much more inviting now than the aging
piece that had previously occupied the room. It also appeared to have
the perfect blend of colors for her tastes, mixing shades of blue and
black just perfectly.</p><p>Natsuki turned around
to get a look at the rest of the room. Most notable was what appeared
to be an entertainment center set up. It had shelves that could be
used for her television, speakers, and more game systems than she
currently possessed. It would be quite a step up from her current
improvised layout, and it would be able to tactfully hide her tangle
of cords in the back.</p><p>Finding her thoughts
going in this direction, Natsuki realized that her subconscious had
already jumped to the meaning of the changes in the room. Shizuru had
transformed it into her room. But, no, it didn’t feel like just a
room… Natsuki strolled over to the desk beside the bed, picking up
one of the pictures that were placed on it. It contained a picture of
Shizuru she’d never seen before. Shizuru seemed to be wearing her
most loving expression in it, which Natsuki had never seen her give
anyone else. Shizuru must have taken the picture specifically for
this purpose.</p><p>Natsuki placed the
picture back on the desk and picked up the other picture. This one
contained a picture of both her and Shizuru, holding each other while
looking lovingly into each other’s eyes. She remembered the day
that Shizuru had asked her, seemingly at random, to take that
picture. She’d figured Shizuru just wanted something for herself,
and she’d been more than happy to oblige for that – after a
little teasing, of course.</p><p>These pictures would
certainly be a good sight to wake up to, Natsuki admitted. This whole
room would be, for that matter. It possessed some comforting quality
that her apartment didn’t. Although she’d lived in her apartment
for over three years now, it had always just felt like a place to
sleep for her. Since she’d lost her mother, she’d never really
had any place that felt like a home for her. She’d been lost and on
her own. Here, with Shizuru just one room away… she was finally
home.</p><p>“Natsuki?”
Shizuru’s voice came from behind her, still full of nervousness.
“Is everything… alright?”</p><p>Natsuki tried to speak
up to respond, but she found that words were failing her. With the
feeling of tears starting to drip out of her eyes, she realized she
was just too emotional to speak right now. Well, she could work with
that too. Placing the picture back down on the desk, she turned
around and walked back to Shizuru. She found that Shizuru’s fear of
her possible rejection had manifested in her eyes. She hadn’t seen
that sight in her since the Carnival, and she wasn’t going to let
it last any longer than she had to.</p><p>Natsuki let her eyes
meet Shizuru’s as she approached, and she tried to pour as much of
her love into them as she could, but maybe Shizuru misinterpreted it
as her way of preparing to let her down gently, as her fear remained.
Natsuki quirked up a smile just as she reached Shizuru, but rather
than letting this speak for itself, her instincts took over for her.
Her arms made their way around Shizuru and her hands found the back
of her girlfriend’s head, tilting it and pulling it forward as she
met her love’s lips with her own.</p><p>Shizuru was shy and
surprised at first, but it didn’t take long for her to give in to
the kiss. Natsuki was sure to pour as much of her love as possible
into it, using it to show her thanks to Shizuru. She could feel her
tears starting to pour down her cheeks, but this just spurred her on
to putting more passion into the kiss. She absolutely loved this
woman and her gift. Her life was finally becoming complete.</p><p>Eventually, Shizuru
seemed to sense Natsuki’s enthusiasm, and, relieved, she wrapped
her arms her girlfriend and happily started to match her energy in
the kiss. She fiercely moved her lips against Natsuki’s, almost as
if trying to devour the other girl. Natsuki didn’t plan to let her
take over quite yet, though, and she was able to hold her own against
Shizuru. She knew that despite Shizuru’s occasional dominating
personality, she truly enjoyed it when Natsuki put up a fight or even
turned the tables on her. Both of them were quite capable of having
fun either way, and things had yet to get dull.</p><p>Unfortunately, none of
this meant that either of them could escape the very human need to
catch their breaths, so they reluctantly had to part their kiss.
Natsuki made up for this by resting her head in the crook of
Shizuru’s neck, and her girlfriend soon did the same with her. “I
take it Natsuki likes her present?” Shizuru asked through her
still-frenzied breathing, the fear and nervousness finally having
vanished from her voice.</p><p>“Yeah,” Natsuki said, allowing herself to relax into 
Shizuru’s
embrace. “I just hope you don’t think giving me my own room will
excuse you from having to sleep with me. I know you need the company
as much as I do, anyways.”</p><p>Natsuki couldn’t see
it, but she knew she’d just brought a blush to Shizuru’s cheeks
with that comment. “Of course, Natsuki,” she said. “We’re
really going to taint Duran’s innocent little mind, you know.”</p><p>“He can sleep on the
floor if need be,” Natsuki said. Though she knew that Shizuru was
trying to tease her, she was already too far in the mood for her
modesty to kick it. Instead, she decided that the time was finally
right for her own extra present, before her courage faded from her.
She gently pulled back from the hug and said, “Alright Shizuru, my
turn now.”</p><p>“Ara?” Shizuru
said.</p><p>“You didn’t think
you were the only one with the idea for some huge extra gift, did
you?” Natsuki said. She moved her head in to give the momentarily
surprised Shizuru a quick kiss before she pulled out of the hug and
headed out into the hallway. She stepped over Duran to retrieve her
duffel bag, before doubling back. She passed Shizuru in the doorway
to the guest room – no, <i>her</i> room – and headed on to the
bathroom.</p><p>Natsuki dropped the bag
once she entered, and started looking around a bit. Finding Shizuru’s
bathrobe hanging off a hook near the tub, she removed it and headed
to the door. She found Shizuru waiting outside for her, a puzzled
expression on her face. Not wanting to spoil the surprise, Natsuki
simply said, “Put this on – only this – and wait till I tell
you I’m ready.” Shizuru barely had time to take the robe from
Natsuki before the door was closed on her.</p><p>Left alone in the
bathroom, Natsuki’s nerves finally caught up with her. Shizuru’s
presence had been giving her the courage she needed, and without her
source of strength around, she was at risk of faltering. She didn’t
plan to let herself screw this up, though. Natsuki forced herself to
focus. <i>This is for Shizuru… Shizuru… Shizuru.</i> Barely
enough courage returning to her, Natsuki started to undress.</p>
