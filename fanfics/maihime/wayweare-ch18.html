<p>The  Butterfly Effect</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Summer  break was over, and the second term had kicked off without mishap. Of  course, that couldn’t be said for the make-up exam Midori had  forced myself and a few other girls into a couple of weeks ago. <em>That</em> had been a disaster, and not because an Orphan showed up, oh no, that  part was the most fun in my opinion. I’ve always known that my  skills were…<em>limited</em> when it came to cooking. Even so, I had worked hard to make that  stupid cake, and it really was difficult, especially since I had to  work with the generally dense Minagi Mikoto and that morality-lacking  flirt Yuuki Nao. To top it all off, our supervisor was that Nun whom,  beyond God and religion, knew nothing about the real world from what  I could tell.
<p>To  keep in the <em>“theme of the kitchen”</em>,  it was a recipe for failure.</p>
<p>And quite a failure it  had been since the taste testers all became ill and had to be rushed  to the hospital after eating our concoction. It wasn’t like it was  going to kill them or anything serious…They might have to have  their stomachs pumped, but that wasn’t entirely my fault. It wasn’t  like I picked all the incompetent participants for our group.</p>
<p>Bad luck. That’s all  that it was.</p>
<p>Either  way, I was quite thankful that the whole mess was over with and done,  although I was wishing that something <em>remotely</em> exciting would happen now that I was stuck in a classroom  half-listening to the mundane rumbling of my Japanese teacher’s  lecture.</p>
<p>I really must have  zoned out at one point, because the next sound I heard was the bell  signaling the end of fifth period.</p>
<p><em>Good, just one more  class…but it’s physics…god, I hate equations…</em></p>
<p>Slumping in my seat, I  buried my face in my arms that were laid on my desk.</p>
<p>“<strong>Hey, did you hear  about that middle schooler who got attacked on campus last night?”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Yeah, Yoshida  Kiyone. She’s in the choir, right?”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>I think so, I  heard that’s when it happened, when she was on her way back to the  dorms.”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>That’s so  horrible…Have the caught any suspects?”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>I don’t believe  so. To think that there’s some sick pervert out there…Eah!”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Someone said that  it was a monster, you know, like a vampire or something.”</strong></p>
<p><em>Monster…? Could it  have been…</em></p>
<p>“<strong>That can’t be  true—“</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>But they said she  had a bite mark on her neck!”</strong></p>
<p>…<em>Orphan…?</em></p>
<p>“<strong>Then  the guy who did it really </strong><em><strong>is</strong></em><strong> sick.”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Yeah, and I heard  they found two other girls besides just her.”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>So there were  THREE attacked last night?!”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Seems that way.”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Goodness…Well,  I certainly hope that something is being done about it.”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>I heard the  Executive Director was in quite an uproar when she found out.”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>That doesn’t  surprise me. She goes off at any little occurrence.”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Hey, at least she  gets stuff done though.”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>I guess you’re  right, but that doesn’t mean she has to scream all the time.”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>I know what you  mean. I don’t see how Kikukawa-san puts up with it all the time…”</strong></p>
<p>All useful information  seeming to have been exchanged between the two, I effortlessly tuned  out the rest of their conversation as I shifted my head so I could  look out the window.</p>
<p><em>I wonder if it really was an Orphan…If anyone would know, it’d  be Sakomizu…I guess it’s about time I paid him another visit…</em></p>
<p>“Alright, alright, calm down and take your seats,” boomed our  instructor as he entered the classroom, “Turn to page  one-eighty-six…”</p>
<p>Absentmindedly pulling out my book, I did as I was told.</p>
<p><em>Heh, but I’ve got to feel some sympathy for Shizuru  though…Suzushiro will probably be raising kane this afternoon…</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em><strong>Slam!</strong></em>
<p>“Do you hear me,  President?!”</p>
<p>I stared down at the  cup in front of me, it’s contents stirring from the blow the desk  it sat upon had just received from the zealous blonde who continued  her rant that had started at least five minutes ago. I took said cup  into my hands, a safety precaution, I assure you.</p>
<p><em>Yes,  Haruka-san, I hear you loud and…well, loud.</em></p>
<p>“—We’ve had three  victims in one night. It is time for us executives, no, for the  entire council’s danger management skills to be tested. Therefore,  we need your approval for the right to investigate, and we need to  raise the caution level until we capture the criminal.”</p>
<p>“But  other than the blood taken away,” Reito chimed in, looking over the  assault report copies we had got our hands on, “it seems like  neither <em>this</em> nor <em>that </em>happened,  so we shouldn’t have to take things that far.”</p>
<p>The executive director,  appearing to be totally appalled by the remark, was quick to snap  back, “Vice President, you can only say that because you’re a  male. There isn’t any other case as horrifying as this to a female.  Additionally, rumors about vampires and monsters have started to  circulate…President, your decision, please.”</p>
<p><em>Monsters indeed…If  this had occurred only a few months ago, I wouldn’t have believed  it myself, but now…</em></p>
<p>Breaking my  contemplative silence, I finally spoke, “You’re right. For once,  I agree with Suzushiro-san.” I took Haruka’s baffled expression  to mean that reassurance was necessary, “I’m counting on you.”</p>
<p>“My honor is on the  line,” the girl declared before spinning on her heels, “Yukino!”</p>
<p>Tate, Reito, and I  watched as Haruka marched out of the room in her usual fashion,  Yukino slipping out quietly behind her. Once their footsteps had  faded away down the hall, we all let ourselves relax a little.</p>
<p>“Motivated, isn’t  she? That’s great, but are you sure about this?” Reito questioned  me.</p>
<p>“I’m female as  well,” I replied, although the excuse was a weak one for a HiME  like myself, “Besides…”</p>
<p>Idly, I traced my  finger over the mark that had embedded itself on my left side.</p>
<p><em>If it’s one of  those creatures again—</em></p>
<p>“Fujino-san…? Is  there something wrong?” the male asked, raising an inquisitive  eyebrow at me.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. Let us trust that Suzushiro-san will handle this  situation. Now, onto other business…”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Rumor  has it there’s a <em>monster </em>attacking  girls at night around campus,” I started, leaning back against my  usual tree, the shade it provided cooling me on this particularly  warm late-August afternoon.
<p>Sakomizu acknowledged  by presence as he continued his gardening, “Mmh. It has become a  bit…troublesome…”</p>
<p>“Troublesome? It’s  just another Orphan like the others, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“…That’s not  entirely true.”</p>
<p>“So you’re saying  that it’s different from an unexpected Orphan?”</p>
<p>“The people higher-up  are really touchy about it. It seems someone, if not something, is  manipulating all of this.”</p>
<p><em>So someone else out  there is stirring up trouble for the First District too, eh?</em></p>
<p>“Interesting. If it’s  your enemy, it could be my ally.”</p>
<p>“I doubt that…Then  you plan to do nothing this time?”</p>
<p>“Heh,  if you want something done, you have <em>Miss  Justice</em>,” I reminded the man,  smirking as a result of my own sarcasm.</p>
<p>I heard an amused sigh  slip from the teacher as he figured out whom I was implying, “She’s  been on probation since that recent re-exam incident. She locked  herself up in the Library’s basement in order to finish her  thesis.”</p>
<p>“At any rate, don’t  count on me. I have my own objectives.”</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>“What did you find?  Over there…”</p>
<p>I thought back to the  night when Mai, Mikoto and I had broke into the abandoned research  facility…to my mom’s wrecked office…the old toy of Duran’s  and the weird number on its collar…The truth was, we didn’t have  an answer yet. Yamada was still looking into it after all this time.  He had told me he thought he was getting close about a week ago, but  he still wasn’t completely done with his search.</p>
<p><em>What was that  number—</em></p>
<p>“Let it go,”  Sakomizu interrupted my thoughts, “Nothing good will come from  digging up the past.”</p>
<p>“Mind your own  business,” I snapped as I stormed off.</p>
<p>Now that I thought  about it, maybe it was about time to call my informant again to see  if there was anything new to report. Yamada hated to be interrupted  when he was working, but he couldn’t complain as long as I kept  paying him, right?</p>
<p>Retrieving my cell from  my pocket, I lazily dialed the man’s number as I walked across  campus.</p>
<p>“Yamada, it’s me.  Find anything new?”</p>
<p>“<em>Kuga…Yeah,  actually, I did.”</em></p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“<em>Come on, you know  how this works by now.”</em></p>
<p>I snarled in  impatience, “Right…When do you want to meet?”</p>
<p>“<em>How about  tomorrow night? That’ll give me time to collect all my notes.”</em></p>
<p>“All right, see you  at nine.”</p>
<p>Hanging up, and  desperately fighting the temptation to hurl my phone at the nearest  tree out of frustration, I managed to slip the device back into it’s  usual resting place in my jacket, albeit a little forcefully, as I  continued to make my way to my bike.</p>
<p><em>Damn Yamada and his  money…eh, but I guess he’s got to make a living somehow…It’s  just one more day anyway…twenty-four hours…I can wait that long…</em></p>
<p>Surely, I wouldn’t be sleeping tonight.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Another day had passed.
<p>There was still no  culprit for the school ground assaults, but there also had not been  any further attacks last night. Was this because of our heightened  security? I hoped so, that way our efforts, well, Haruka-san’s  efforts and my credibility for putting her in that position, were not  in vain.</p>
<p>Earlier in an emergency  Saturday meeting in which we had received an update from the  Executive Committee, we had decided that it would be in the best  interest if the Student Council stayed on campus for the evening. We  weren’t being forced to stay all night or anything, but if any  leads or progress were to take place, it would be wise for the  council to be present to handle the situation.</p>
<p>And that’s exactly  where we were now. It had turned dark outside about an hour ago, but  that didn’t cause Reito to leave his post by the window. He hadn’t  spoken or moved in quite a while from what I had observed. Tate  Yuichi was also present, but he, unlike his upper classman, was  seated at one of the tables, leaning back in his chair as he  continuously checked his cell phone. I’m sure that he was bored and  would have rather been elsewhere, but there was something about the  expression on his face that was telling me it was more than that.</p>
<p>Taking a sip of my  green tea that I had brewed only a few minutes ago, I decided to try  to get some kind of reaction out of either of them.</p>
<p>“Another night, isn’t  it?”</p>
<p>“Hopefully nothing will happen tonight, either,” Reito plainly  stated without even the smallest flinch.</p>
<p>I had never seen my friend so apprehensive before. Even Tate wasn’t  his usual lax self as of late…What had happened to cause such an  extreme change in attitude in these two? I knew that it wasn’t just  these latest events; I had noticed a while back that something seemed  different in both of them, but even with my keen perceptive  abilities, I knew that I didn’t have enough information to make a  logical assessment. But if I had to make a guess at this very  instant, it would certainly be on something extremely simple and yet  immensely complicated…the cause of most male’s angst: a woman.</p>
<p>With the umpteenth <em>‘click’</em> of Tate’s cell phone flipping  open, I sighed, “How about we call it a night? I’m sure the two  of you are as equally tired as I am.”</p>
<p>“I agree,” Reito answered, finally turning away from the window,  “We aren’t doing anything by just sitting here…And Haruka-san  has our phone numbers in case something does come up.”</p>
<p>Without a word, Tate stood and made his way to the door, disappearing  from my and Reito’s sight in haste.</p>
<p>“I wonder what Yuichi-kun is upset about?” I commented, glancing  back over at the other male.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he’ll tell us if he needs to,” Reito remarked, “Now  then, allow me to walk you back to your dorm, Shizuru-san.”</p>
<p>I obliged, though it wasn’t like I really had a choice. The ironic  thing was that if we were to be attacked, <em>I</em> would be the one  doing the protecting for the both of us. Hopefully, I prayed, that  wouldn’t be the case.</p>
<p>After collecting our things and locking the door behind us, Reito and  I walked out into the darkness of the night in silence.</p>
<p>The sound of our heavy footsteps echoed through the courtyard, and it  was then that I decided to question the young man walking beside me.  Reito and I had known each other for quite some time, and in all  honesty I really did consider him a friend despite how formal we were  around each other, so it was only natural for me to be concerned  about my humble Vice President.</p>
<p>“You seem a little distracted lately,” I stated quite bluntly.</p>
<p>If the boy was shocked at my words, he certainly didn’t show it,  “Is that so?”</p>
<p>“I do not mean to intrude, it just seems that you are…distant at  times. Did something happen?”</p>
<p>Reito kept his lips sealed momentarily, and I could tell that he was  contemplating my question thoroughly. “It’s just that  I’m…concerned…about a certain individual…”</p>
<p>“Concerned? About what?”</p>
<p>“…It’s complicated…and I’m sure I do not even know the  whole story myself, so…”</p>
<p><em>In other words, you’re not at liberty to tell me…But…I’ve  felt the very same far too many times…</em></p>
<p>“I see. Is there anything I can do? Talk to this person maybe?”</p>
<p>He shook his head, “I appreciate your concern, Shizuru, but at the  moment I don’t think there’s much anyone can do.”</p>
<p>I flashed a small sad smile, “That seems to be the case as of late,  doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>Reito laughed briskly, easing up just a tad, “Indeed.”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
For a Saturday night,  the Rorschach bar was surprisingly calm. Usually the small murky room  would always be packed, it’s booths full with returning customers,  but that didn’t seem to be the case tonight as I waltzed through  the door in my usual manner.
<p>I spotted Yamada  sitting alone in one of the stations in the back corner, a sweaty  half-empty beer bottle before him, puffing on the cheap cigarette  between his lips. In the relatively short time I had known the man, I  had only seen him smoke on one other occasion. When I had pressed him  about it, my informant had told me it was an old habit that had  started in college whenever he was seriously stressed about  something.</p>
<p>I knew it wasn’t a  good sign.</p>
<p>Stopping by the bar, I  called for a glass of water, and it was promptly handed to me moments  later, the middle-aged balding bartender giving me an annoyed frown  because he wasn’t earning anything with my being there. It wasn’t  like I was legally old enough to purchase a drink anyway, not that I  would have. I had chosen a long time ago to keep any harmful  substances, alcohol included, out of my system. Besides, after being  around Midori, who wouldn’t come to that same conclusion?</p>
<p>Ignoring the look, I  made my way over to where Yamada was waiting and sat down at the  booth next to his, our backs facing. I took a sip of the cool liquid  in my glass in an attempt to calm my nerves, and without having to  prompt anything, Yamada began the conversation I had been itching to  commence.</p>
<p>“That number was an  account number. Most companies that deposited in it were dummies, but  when you follow the major flow of money, you find two names.”</p>
<p>“What are they?”</p>
<p>“From here on, if you  want me to keep investigating, it’ll cost you extra. It’s life  threatening for me too.”</p>
<p><em>Enough with this  stalling bullshit.</em></p>
<p>“Deal,” I retorted  without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Iwasaka  Pharmaceutical. The other is the Searrs Foundation.”</p>
<p>“Searrs Foundation?”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Late Saturday  night…well, I suppose by that time it was technically early Sunday  morning, I received a phone call from Haruka-san informing me that  the culprit of the night assaults had been apprehended, and I have to  say that I was quite shocked, not to mention skeptical, when she told  me it was Sister Yukariko.
<p>Sanada Yukariko. The  extent of my knowledge on the woman began and ended at about the same  place. She was the nun of the campus chapel, aiding the students when  they asked for guidance and sometimes even helping with any moral  disciplinary measures the Executive Committee might send her way. So  what would drive this pure soul to committing such foul acts? That  was the question that deprived me of some precious sleep, but when I  did manage to drift off, I was still hung on my original  conclusion…Surely there had been a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>I had implored  Suzushiro-san to hold off on any interrogations until today when the  whole council could be present, and when I arrived at the school, I  was pleased to see that the stubborn girl had listened to my wish.  Upon approaching the Executive Committee room, I saw that all the  other Student Council members were already present and congregated  just outside the door.</p>
<p>As soon as I was in  proximity, Haruka immediately addressed me, “Fujino Kaichou! It’s  about time you got here!”</p>
<p>“Ara…am I late? We  did agree on eight o’clock, did we not?” I lightly questioned.</p>
<p>“It’s  eight-o-five,” the blonde pointed out.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Reito  intervened before this pointless dispute could continue, “Well, now  that we’re all here, shall we proceed with the interrogation?”</p>
<p>“Right,” Suzushiro  snapped, instantly getting back on track, “Since Yukino and I were  the only one’s present last night, I want to ask the questions.”</p>
<p>I sighed, “That seems  fair enough. Has the Sister said anything of the incident?”</p>
<p>“No, she hasn’t  spoken a word at all,” Yukino softly informed me.</p>
<p>“And what do we know  of the situation?”</p>
<p>Haruka was quick to  answer me this time, “At approximately ten-forty-three p.m. a  scream was heard just outside the church. When we went to  investigate, we found Sister Yukariko holding a bow-like weapon in  her hands, standing over an unconscious Senou Aoi who had obviously  been attacked due to her ripped clothing. After the Sister was  apprehended, we took Senou-san to the hospital to have her injuries  taken care of.”</p>
<p>“I see. Let us get on  with this then,” I remarked, and after Reito had politely opened  the door, we all silently filed in.</p>
<p>The woman in question  sat in a lonely chair positioned in the middle of the room, her  expression forlorn, her gaze cast to the ground. She didn’t even  stir when we came before her, taking our scattered positions around  the room.</p>
<p>Once we had all settled  in, Haruka began her questioning.</p>
<p>“Sister, we’re here  to ask about the events that occurred last night,” the Executive  director began as if we didn’t know what our gathering here was  about, “First, is there anything you’d like to say?”</p>
<p>At the lack of  response, the girl continued, “What were you doing on the school  grounds at such a late hour?”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“What was that weapon  that we saw in your possession? Where was it obtained?”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“What motives did you  have for attacking Senou-san?”</p>
<p>Still with no reply,  Haruka ran her fingers through her short bangs with a raspy sigh, “If  you remain silent, there will be nothing we can do for you.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“The circumstances  are collaborating against you. Please honestly tell us what happened.  We can still take care of the situation at this point.”</p>
<p>“Haruka-san, now—“  Reito jumped in.</p>
<p>“’<em>Now, now’</em>,  will not solve the problem,” the blonde harshly interrupted, “We  even have an injured person.”</p>
<p>“But we haven’t  found this weapon that you claim to have seen, or the arrow that  injured Senou-san, right?” the male coolly argued, maintaining his  composure all the while.</p>
<p><em>It…disappeared?  Could that mean—</em></p>
<p>“We witnessed the  event!” the girl defensively shot back, “Sister was at the site  with a strange weapon. You saw it too, right, Yuichi-san?”</p>
<p>Suddenly being dragged  into the conversation, Tate’s expression rapidly changed from  pensive to shocked, and then finally to uncertain, “I…umm…really  don’t…”</p>
<p><em>Yuichi-san…?</em></p>
<p>Still with no backup,  Haruka continued to press forward, “If you remain silent, in the  worst case scenario, we’ll ignore your academic punishment but have  to—“</p>
<p>“Hold on,” I  interjected, “Suzushiro-san, will you leave me alone with Sister  for a while? I’ll take the case over from here.”</p>
<p>Not wanting to openly  challenge me in front of the others, particularly the Sister, Haruka  simply nodded in defeat, “…Yes, Kaichou-san.”</p>
<p>After everyone had  left, some more reluctantly than others, I closed the door and turned  back to Yukariko-san who continued to remain speechless.</p>
<p>“Ara, it must have  been very unnerving to be surrounded by so many people asking you  horrid questions like that…I apologize for any discomfort we might  have caused you, Sister,” I sincerely told the woman, gently  placing a hand on her shoulder as I passed by to retrieve a chair for  myself.</p>
<p>Once I had positioned  myself in front of the nun, I paused before sitting, “Where are my  manners? Would you like anything to drink? Tea perhaps?”</p>
<p>I only received a shake  of the head in return.</p>
<p>Slightly disappointed  in the response, I went ahead and took a seat, “Let us get to the  matter at hand then. Sister, your presence at the scene of the  incident is unquestionable, and that inevitably makes you a suspect…”</p>
<p>I noticed the older  woman’s brow crease, one of the first signs I had seen from her  this entire time. With this, I continued.</p>
<p>“…However, that  does not necessarily condemn you of being the assailant. Only you  know what happened last night, and the only way that I can help prove  your innocence is if you tell me what took place.”</p>
<p>Finally, Sister  Yukariko tore her gaze from the floor to look at me. Her eyes were  lined with tears, but not a single one fell from the blue orbs.</p>
<p>I gave the woman a  comforting smile, “You didn’t attack Senou-san, did you?”</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>“Did you see who or  what did?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“Can you tell me what  you saw?”</p>
<p>“…You…wouldn’t  believe me if I did…”</p>
<p>“I think I should be  the judge of that, ne? Please, continue.”</p>
<p>The woman paused,  internally debating with herself on what to do, or possibly trying to  find the right words to describe what she had witnessed, but either  way, her facial expressions told me as much.</p>
<p>“It was…a…creature,  a monster…I thought I was dreaming…Maybe I was and I…really did  those horrible things—!“</p>
<p>Reaching out, I placed  my hand over the Sister’s, “Something so vivid couldn’t have  been a dream...Now, what of this bow weapon?”</p>
<p>“Again, it doesn’t  seem possible but…but it just…<em>appeared</em> in my hands.”</p>
<p>“And where is it  now?”</p>
<p>“I-I don’t know…”</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>“…You were trying  to help Senou-san, weren’t you?”</p>
<p>The woman gave me a  solemn nod.</p>
<p>“Do not worry,  Sister,” I began while standing, “leave the rest of this to me. I  won’t allow you to be wrongly accused.”</p>
<p>As I started to walk  back towards the door, a sharp intake of breath halted my movement,  and when I looked back over my shoulder, Sister Yukariko was standing  as well, a hand stretched out in my direction.</p>
<p>“Fujino-san…”</p>
<p>“Mmh?”</p>
<p>“W-What I’ve said…”</p>
<p>“Nothing will leave  this room without your consent. Now, come.”</p>
<p>With another nod of the  head, the woman followed me back outside. We walked down the hall to  meet up with the others, receiving a suspicious look from Haruka in  the process.</p>
<p>“Reito-san, would you  mind escorting Sister back home?” I quietly requested.</p>
<p>“What?! We’re  letting her go?” the busty blonde immediately interrupted.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I calmly  replied, “there is no point to further contain an innocent  bystander.”</p>
<p>“Innocent bystander?!  But we saw—!”</p>
<p>“Suzushiro-san, do  you not trust my judgment in this matter?” I almost coldly  questioned, my eyes meeting the other girl’s in a deadlock.</p>
<p>The Executive director  dared to battle my gaze, but eventually crumbled, turning her head  away, “O-Of course I do…”</p>
<p>“Good. Then I do  believe we are done here for the moment. Haruka-san, I ask that you  please continue your search.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Kaichou.  Yukino, let’s go.”</p>
<p>Once the two girls were  gone, Reito gave me a nod before motioning to the silent Sister,  “Shall we?”</p>
<p>As the two began to  walk, Sister Yukariko kept her eyes on me, still looking quite  nervous about the whole situation. Once again, I gave her a  reassuring smile, but once both she and Reito were around the corner,  that smile quickly faded. Resting a finger against my cheek, I  sighed.</p>
<p><em>So Sister is a HiME  as well…or it certainly seems to be that way…What a mess this is  becoming…but what does it all mean…?</em></p>
<p>Continuing the mental warring inside of my head, I made my way to the  student council room.</p>

I knew it was a Sunday  morning, but I still had to try. It wasn’t like I had anything  better to do…more like I couldn’t <em>focus</em> on anything else  long enough to actually accomplish anything, so here I was driving to  the school at eight-something in the morning.
<p>Occasionally, and I  mean <em>occasionally</em>, Shizuru would leave her laptop in the  Student Council room, which was exactly what I was hoping would be  the case today. The room was almost always locked, but I made sure to  be prepared for that in advanced.</p>
<p>So why didn’t I just  call her? I didn’t want to be a bother, especially on a weekend  when she might be busy. That girl would have dropped anything she was  doing for me if I asked, and as much as I appreciated that kindness,  I wasn’t about to abuse it. Besides, even if this expedition ended  up being a bust, I could just wait until tomorrow…maybe.</p>
<p>Despite it being the  weekend, I still parked my bike in its usual hiding spot. After  making the trek to the school, I went straight to the Student Council  room, but surprisingly when I reached out for the door, it easily  shifted with my slight pull.</p>
<p><em>It’s open? That’s  not like Shizuru to leave the door unlocked…I wonder if the council  is here for some reason…</em></p>
<p>I placed my ear up  against the door to see if any noises could be heard on the inside,  but when I was just met with silence, I deducted that it was empty,  and with a shrug I slid the door open.</p>
<p>To my luck, my  burgundy-eyed friend’s computer was sitting upon her barren desk,  and plopping myself down in the black leather chair, I promptly  switched the thing on. It took a second for the laptop to boot up,  but once it did, I rapidly typed away, trying to find any information  there might be on this <em>Searrs Foundation</em> or Iwasaka  Pharmaceutical, which I had actually heard of before.</p>
<p>I had only been at my  search for a few minutes when I heard some voices coming from the  hallway. I instinctively paused in my typing, fearing that I might be  discovered before disregarding the thought and pressing onward. It  was only when the door itself began to slide open that I stopped  again, this time turning towards the door to witness an obviously  surprised Kaichou who quietly gasped at my unexpected presence.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I’m  borrowing it again.”</p>
<p>“You’re sporadic,  as usual,” Shizuru commented as she walked closer.</p>
<p>Ignoring her playful  words, I continued my investigation, “Iwaska Pharmaceutical is one  of this academy’s sponsors?”</p>
<p>“Yep, I met the  important people during the School Anniversary Celebration.”</p>
<p>“But, as I thought,  there were no names from the Searrs Foundation or the company  affiliated with them...” Pushing away from the desk, I stood to  leave, “Thanks, Shizuru.”</p>
<p>“Don’t play too  dangerously.”</p>
<p>Glancing over my  shoulder, I gave the girl an amused smirk before exiting the room and  heading back outside.</p>
<p>The disappointment of  coming up empty handed in my search weighed heavy on my mind as I  made my way back across campus. Although I had sincerely doubted that  I would find any substantial information on this vague corporation,  the small hope that <em>some</em> valuable tidbit of information would  be found lingered on, so needless to say, I was distressed at finding  absolutely nothing at all.</p>
<p><em>Come on,  think…Searrs…where have I heard that name before?  Searrs…Searrs…Alyssa Searrs…That elementary girl…from the  choir…She sang at the festival…her English had surprised me—!  Yamada said that the Searrs Foundation used a U.S. corporation for  cover…could it be? Is she somehow related to this? But she’s just  a kid…Hmm…What do I know about her…? She attends Fuuka  Elementary…sings in the school choir…Didn’t Mai say something  about seeing her and Miyu Greer together? That seems like an odd  pairing…Miyu Greer…adopted daughter of Father Joseph Greer…The  church?!</em></p>
<p>Instantly, I began to  head in the direction of the chapel, the high steeple looming over  the trees revealing its exact location.</p>
<p><em>The church certainly  would be an inconspicuous place…I never even thought about checking  it out before…Although, I doubt there would be anything  questionable in the main auditorium, surely not…I wonder if it has  a basement…?</em></p>
<p>As I approached the  building, I could hear voices from nearby, and I immediately pressed  my back against the nearest tree, peering around to take a look.</p>
<p><em>Executive Committee?  Oh…this must have something to do with those recent attacks…So  much for going that way, I guess I’ll have to look for another  entry point.</em></p>
<p>Snaking my way around  the church, it didn’t take long to find a back doorway. It didn’t  surprise me that the door was locked, but it didn’t stay that way  for long, and I was grateful that I had brought my picks along with  me today.</p>
<p>After descending two  sets of dimly lit stairs, I rounded a corner and could make out a  voice, which sounded much like that of an older male, from further  down the hall. Carefully, I crept closer.</p>
<p>“Who ever thought  Sister would be a Valkyrie? <em>’Look to oneself before looking to  others’</em>…The vampires are working well.”</p>
<p>“True, <em>‘It is  dark at the base of a lighthouse,’</em>” I proclaimed as I walked  into the light, making my presence known, “Who would have ever  thought to find a place like this under the church?”</p>
<p>Father Greer seemed to  be rather shocked, disturbed even, at my sudden appearance, and I,  likewise, was unnerved to see both him and Fuuka’s <em>“Golden  Angel”</em> in this obviously covert place, even if they had been  substantial pieces in bringing me to this very spot.</p>
<p>“Alyssa Searrs, how  I’m amazed. Although it’s not a major organization on the  surface, for you to walk around with your real name is quite a  dignity…”</p>
<p>The man shifted  uneasily, and in an instant, my element was in my hand, raised and  ready to fire.</p>
<p>“Tell me, what do you  guys want? What brought you guys to this academy?”</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, a sharp pain coursed through my head, a loud  ringing deafened my ears, and my vision went white before fading to  darkness.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>Heavy…I  feel…heavy…ugh, and my head is killing me…What in the hell  happened?</em>
<p>Forcing my eyelids open  slowly, I tried to focus my blurred vision, and when everything  finally aligned, I could only make out what appeared to be an  abandoned factory of sorts, but what astonished me the most was that  I was suspended from a rope, tied in a way that I couldn’t move my  arms in the least.</p>
<p><em>How did I—!</em></p>
<p>Out of nowhere, an  Orphan appeared in the sky, and no sooner had I seen the creature, it  began flying right for me. With nothing else to do, I tightly shut my  eyes.</p>
<p><em>Duran! Someone!  Help!</em></p>
<p>As if my prayers had  been answered, the next thing I knew I was falling. I hit the metal  platform below with a loud thud, rolling down its angled tiles a few  feet before coming to a stop. Gazing upward, I was astonished to see  who my rescuer had been.</p>
<p>“Mai!”</p>
<p>“Natsuki! Are you  okay?” the busty girl hastily questioned as she flew over.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I informed  her as I stood, “Burn through these ropes, will you?”</p>
<p>Once I was free, I  quickly made my way up to the level walkway, Mai hovering along  beside me.</p>
<p>“What happened? How  did you get here?”</p>
<p>“I was looking into  the Searrs Foundation—“</p>
<p>“Searrs Foundation?!”</p>
<p>“An unknown  capitalist organization that uses the guise of a U.S. corporation,”  I explained as I continued to sprint, “It’s power can even decide  the succeeding President.”</p>
<p>“Please correct  that,” a monotone voice intervened, stopping us in our tracks,  “It’s not mere decision. From the oldest time in history, we have  been determining the fate of the world…For the coming of the Golden  Era.”</p>
<p>“Miyu-san?  Alyssa-chan?” Mai uttered.</p>
<p>“You guys!” I  called out, not wanting to believe what I was seeing myself.</p>
<p>“Why?!” the fire  HiME followed, “You’re joking, right? Miyu-san, Alyssa-chan?!”</p>
<p>I watched in wonder as  the older girl kneeled down, the blonde elementary student whispering  something inaudible into her ear before Miyu leapt high into the air,  her left arm changing into a blade as she came at Mai and me.  Materializing my element, I tried to shoot at the platinum haired  girl who easily dodged all of my shots. When Miyu reached the same  platform I was standing on, I didn’t hesitate to summon my Child.</p>
<p>“Duran! Load Chrome  Cartridge…Fire!”</p>
<p>I can’t honestly say  that I know what happened next because it happened so fast that I  couldn’t keep up. All I know is that there was a large explosion  that sent Mai, Duran and myself flying backwards from the blow.  Luckily I managed to snag a piece of the now-destroyed railing, but I  couldn’t say the same for my Child as I watched the silver wolf hit  the ground below with a startled and painful yelp.</p>
<p>“Duran!”</p>
<p>After securing a  landing spot, I allowed myself to drop to the platform below, running  to my Child’s side immediately.</p>
<p>“Duran…Disperse for  now.”</p>
<p>I could feel him  digress with me in my mind, emitting a low whimper at the same time.  Standing my ground, I ordered him again, and this time he obeyed, but  I could still feel his uneasiness within me.</p>
<p>It was about at this  time that I heard a high-pitched cry that could only belong to Mai’s  Child, Kagutsuchi. The white dragon and the Orphan that had attacked  me from before darted through the sky, fireballs disrupting the calm  darkness of the night. Not long before the battle had started, it  abruptly ended when an aimless shot from Kagutsuchi hit one of the  storage buildings and it erupted into furious flames, consuming the  Orphan in the process.</p>
<p>“What amazing power,”  Miyu’s voice once again cut through the night air.</p>
<p>I watched as the  restless dragon moved forward, obviously waiting for the command to  incinerate the two girl’s with his mighty flames, but of course the  redhead would never give that command on her own.</p>
<p>“Mai, blast it now!”  I tried to plead with the girl, knowing that if the pair weren’t  dealt with now, they would only cause more problems in the future.  Not to mention they had kidnapped me…I wasn’t too thrilled about  that either.</p>
<p>Mai’s silence  prompted the other girl to speak yet again, “Tokiha-san, you are an  interesting being. We’ll meet again.”</p>
<p>At that, I quickly  raised my weapon again, “You won’t get away!”</p>
<p>Before I could fire, a  great white light shone from the Searrs girl’s hair, burning my  eyes, and then, in an instant, the two simply vanished.</p>
<p>I cursed mentally  before snapping my head in the direction of the redhead, “Why  didn’t you blast them?!”</p>
<p>“That would have  killed them!”</p>
<p>“And they weren’t  just trying to do the exact same thing to you?!”</p>
<p>“But—!”</p>
<p>“You know that  they’ll just try to come after us again!”</p>
<p>That certainly got her  thinking, and Mai, with no countermeasure, could only hang her head,  “But…”</p>
<p>With a rough sigh, I  tried to calm myself and quietly called for my child again, jumping  on his back after he had switched to flight mode.</p>
<p>“Forget about this  for now. We need to get out of here before the authorities show up.”</p>
<p>I didn’t wait to see  if Mai, and Mikoto whom I hadn’t seen until right before I left,  took my advice or not, but I’m quite sure that they did.</p>
<p>When I finally made it  back to the apartment, I immediately went to the cupboard to retrieve  some painkillers for my continuously throbbing skull. Whether it was  hurting from the blow I had taken in the church basement or the  stress that was beginning to build up over the mess that had just  happened, I couldn’t be sure.</p>
<p>After I had forced a  couple of the pills down my throat, I lumbered over to the couch and  fell back on it’s soft cushioning, draping an arm over my eyes.</p>
<p><em>Why does everything  have to keep getting more and more complicated? If Mai had just taken  those two out…but…what were they? Miyu…she’s some kind  of…android…and the Searrs girl…Searrs Foundation…What does it  have to do with...Eh, stop thinking…I can’t…I can’t think  right now…</em></p>
<p>Blindly reaching out at  the coffee table in front of me, I eventually located the TV remote  and pressed the ‘POWER’ button, the device against the wall  coming to life with a flash.</p>
<p>I dumbly flipped  through the channels before my exhaustion got the better of me and I  lost myself to the world of dreams.</p>
