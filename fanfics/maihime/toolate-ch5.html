<a href="../maihime/toolate-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><p>Puppy</p><hr><p><i>~Secrets~</i></p><p>I’ve been reluctant to wake up before, but nothing 
like I was that particular morning. In my dreams, I could be with Natsuki. We led many 
different lives, we got together in so many different ways, and it always worked out 
perfectly. But that wasn’t this world. In this world, I was lying in bed alone, Natsuki 
having abandoned me sometime in the night. I kept myself on the verge of sleep as long as I 
could, but in the end, the absence of Natsuki’s warmth was simply undeniable.</p><p>I didn’t 
have Natsuki. It was as simple as that. In many other lives, I may have found her, but in 
this one I’d just missed my chance. I was so close, too. Close enough to get one night of 
dreams. Enough to know what I was missing, before she left me for her fiancé. I didn’t 
begrudge her that decision. I could tell by the light in the room, even if I didn’t open my 
eyes, that it was getting into the day. Reito would certainly be worried, and he deserved an 
explanation. Natsuki wouldn’t keep something like this secret from him, like I’d kept it 
from her.</p><p>Perhaps if I hadn’t kept my feelings secret, this could have turned out 
better. I could have let Natsuki know she had another option before she committed to 
marrying Reito, rather than force her to face it afterwards. Or perhaps for her sake, I 
should have remained strong, and kept this secret forever, even if I destroyed myself in the 
process.</p><p>No. That certainly wasn’t the best option. Natsuki was an adult. She deserved 
to know the whole truth so she could make her own decisions. It wasn’t my place to shield 
her from difficult decisions. Perhaps I had waited too long, hoping that my feelings would 
fade as I could convince myself that she was taken. At least at the point where I knew it 
wasn’t happening that easily, I should have said something to Natsuki. As she’d proven the 
previous night, she was my friend, even if she wasn’t my lover.</p><p>No more secrets. If 
Natsuki chose Reito, then I would just have to live with it, loving her without 
reciprocation until my feelings burned out, or until I found someone else. I wouldn’t 
destroy myself trying to hold my feelings in again. I had to face the world as it was, and 
make the most of it.</p><p>At last, I peeled my eyes open, forcing myself to fully awaken to 
the fact that I was left alone in bed, without Natsuki. Taking a few long seconds to let out 
a deep sigh, I turned my head to check the time. There I found her note.</p><p><i>Really 
sorry I had to leave, Shizuru, but I can’t leave Reito without an explanation. He deserves 
to know what’s going on. At this point so do you, so I’ll just say this: Don’t give up on 
me. It’s not too late.<hr></i></p><p><i>~Simplicity~</i></p><p>Marrying Reito was the easy 
choice. It was also, undeniably, the wrong one. It wasn’t who I was. As much as I may have 
wished to just live my life like a typical girl, it would never have worked. I was deceiving 
myself in saying that that was what I wanted.</p><p>A sense of exhilaration hit me as I left 
Shizuru’s room. I hadn’t felt anything like this since I’d played games with Suzushiro-san, 
trying to make her snap with my behavior. I wasn’t born to be a faithful housewife. I needed 
to go wild. Some of my friends have compared me to a dog – I can indeed be a very faithful 
companion, but you’d damn well better give me a huge backyard to run around in when I need 
it.</p><p>Reito had tamed me from the wild animal I was when we’d first met. Although it was 
nice to be with someone like him and show a tamer side, I missed the freedom I’d had before. 
The more I stayed with Reito, the more I settled down. My degree would end up as nothing 
more than a piece of paper on the wall of our house if we got married. My only life would be 
his.</p><p>Fine for some girls, but not for me. Staying with Reito would be too easy, too 
simple… too boring. Would Shizuru end up being any different? At that point, I had no idea. 
And I loved it.</p><hr><p><i>~Warmth~</i></p><p><i>It’s not too late.</i></p><p>I held onto 
those words throughout the day. I nearly bounced around my dorm in giddiness. Most days I 
pictured Natsuki as a cute puppy, but for this one day, I was hers. If only she could have 
been there to see it. But she had important things to do, so I waited. Puppies could be 
patient too, after all, waiting for their masters to come home after a long day.</p><p>I 
kept myself occupied as best as I could with homework and my studies, hoping to get a 
phonecall or a knock on the door from Natsuki. None came, but I didn’t let that faze me. The 
simple fact that I might still have a chance was enough, whatever Natsuki might have been up 
to in the meantime. I would let her come to me. Until she did, the spark of hope she’d lit 
within me would be more than enough to keep me warm as I slept. I didn’t even need to hold 
Natsuki in my arms that night to dream of even more heavens for us to be together 
in.</p><hr><p><i>~Dreams~</i></p><p>Reito was a good guy, I’ll give him that much. I’d been 
expecting a fight from him, but I got nothing. I had no idea at the time why our breakup 
went so well, but I just chalked it up to him honestly caring for me as a friend and wanting 
what was best for me. In retrospect, it may have had a bit more to do with a certain friend 
of his sister’s that he met around that time and later ended up dating.</p><p>I was free. 
But as much as a dog might wish to run around in the wild for a day, she always would need 
somewhere nice and warm to sleep at night. I took my day of freedom for myself, but the 
night was always on my mind. As much as I couldn’t keep Reito wondering that morning, I 
couldn’t leave Shizuru wondering that night.</p><p>Maybe it wouldn’t work out. Maybe she’d 
end up just like Reito, or even worse. I didn’t feel like that would happen, though. Even if 
I weren’t so sure, I needed to try. The call of the wild was calling me to Shizuru. She was 
the unknown. She was adventure. Perhaps in time she’d be my shelter for the night, while I 
ran wild during the day. Or, even better, she might supply me with a way of going wild all 
on her own.</p><p>Now I was just dreaming. But what did it matter? It had taken a dream to 
break me from Reito; I could use this dream to get together with Shizuru. I just wanted to 
make sure I could return the favor. She’d been dreaming of me, I was sure, and it was time 
she finally realized that dream.</p><p>I waited until it was late and I was sure she was 
dreaming of me before I made my move. Even though I hadn’t done it in years, picking the 
lock to Shizuru’s door was still a breeze for me. Motivation will do that to you. I snuck 
into her room, leaving the lights off and just letting my eyes adjust so I didn’t disturb 
Shizuru. I found her on her bed, hugging a pillow with a blissful smile on her face. 
Perfect.</p><p>I crawled carefully onto the bed, hovering just over Shizuru. A gentle brush 
on her cheek was all it took for her to loosen her hold on the pillow and roll onto her 
back, facing up at me. I might have had a few qualms about what I planned to do next, but 
her gentle utterance of “…suki…” was enough to ease my mind.</p><p>I lowered myself slowly, 
coming to a rest on top of Shizuru. Somewhere within her mind, she must have known what I 
was doing, as her cheeks tinged with a blush. “It’s time to wake up, Shizuru,” I whispered 
to her, “but I won’t ask you to leave your dreams behind when you do.”</p><p>A gentle 
fluttering of Shizuru’s eyelashes was all the response I got, but it was all I needed. I 
closed the last remaining inches between us. My lips met with Shizuru’s. Time slowed as her 
lips took charge of the kiss, capturing mine within them. Her arms wrapped around me, and I 
surrendered myself to Shizuru’s dreams.</p><p>I was Shizuru’s puppy. For the night, at 
least. And every night since then, as it turned out.</p>
