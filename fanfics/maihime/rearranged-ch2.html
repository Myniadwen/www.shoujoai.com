<a href="../maihime/rearranged-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>She wasn&#39;t helping. At all. Not when she looked at her with eyes that 
showed she was only thinking about one thing and one thing only. It 
really was quite distracting.

&quot;Shizuru, could you please try to focus here?&quot;

&quot;Oh, but I am focusing, Natsuki.&quot;

&quot;Focus on the problem, not on me!&quot;

&quot;Maybe I could focus better if you helped me get a few things off my 
mind.&quot;

&quot;Such as?&quot;

As soon as she asked that question, Natsuki immediately regretted it. 
Well, almost regretted it, because she had to admit, she was thinking 
about &quot;it&quot; too. &quot;It&quot; being the decidedly intimate sessions on the couch 
that they&#39;d been engaging in every time they met. The usual routine that 
had been developing was as follows: they&#39;d arrive at her apartment, go 
into the kitchen and get something to drink, come back out to the living 
room and exchange pleasantries before getting into a serious 
conversation about the approaching marriage. At some point during the 
discussion, however, one of them would catch the expectant gleam in the 
other&#39;s eyes, and any further progress on the problem would be shot to 
pieces.

Tonight, of course, was no exception. Only this time they&#39;d only talked 
for five minutes before Shizuru started giving Natsuki that look that 
said, &#39;I want you.&#39; The desire in her eyes was unmistakable, and Natsuki 
was finding she didn&#39;t have the willpower to resist something she so 
badly wanted as well.

It surprised her, actually. These powerful feelings of desire and need 
that welled up inside of her whenever they looked at each other that 
way, or whenever they were kissing each other senseless. She never would 
have guessed she could feel this way about anyone, let alone her female 
best friend whom she&#39;d known for years. As a senior at Fuuka Academy, 
she had yet to meet anyone who sparked her romantic interest. And she 
knew Shizuru, who had taken a year off from school before attending 
college, had never held an interest in anyone (except her) either.

So here they were, and those lustful feelings had taken a hold of both 
of them and there was only one way to quench them.

Shizuru began to crawl towards Natsuki on her hands and knees around the 
coffee table to where Natsuki was sitting on the floor. When she got in 
front of her, they both leaned in for the kiss, capturing each other&#39;s 
mouths without hesitation. With their mouths slanting across one 
another&#39;s over and over, Shizuru moved over Natsuki, pushing her onto 
her back. Natsuki let her kiss her like this for a moment, but soon 
rolled the two of them over so she was on top. Shizuru&#39;s eyes widened 
slightly, as this was a first for Natsuki; she had always been the one 
in control until now.

Any thoughts that were in her mind vanished as soon as she felt Natsuki 
place her fingertips just under the hem of her light sweater. She kissed 
Natsuki encouragingly, practically squirming with anticipation as to 
what her companion was about to do. Natsuki&#39;s hand gradually moved up, 
lightly brushing and caressing the smooth skin and trembling muscles of 
Shizuru&#39;s stomach.

&quot;Please,&quot; Shizuru whispered against Natsuki&#39;s mouth, begging for her to 
touch her where they both knew she wanted her to. Not giving in so 
easily, Natsuki moved her hand up and teasingly ran her fingertips along 
the tops of Shizuru&#39;s breasts, just above her bra. Panting, Shizuru 
arched her back and pushed her chest into Natsuki&#39;s hand, causing the 
younger girl to finally relent and slowly caress her sensitive flesh.

Shizuru moaned into Natsuki&#39;s mouth, unable to contain the sensations 
coursing through her body. This was the furthest Natsuki had ever gone 
when it came to touching her, and she could hardly restrain herself from 
grabbing the other girl and ravishing her senseless. Her self-control 
paid off, however, as Natsuki began to move down her body, pausing to 
kiss her neck before moving down to her stomach.

Natsuki knew Shizuru was holding herself back. Knew that Shizuru wanted 
more, but didn&#39;t want to ask for it outright. So she decided to thank 
the other girl and show how much she appreciated the time Shizuru was 
giving her to get used to this new territory they were exploring 
together. Besides the fact that she too wanted to take their intimacy to 
the next level.

With that in mind, Natsuki began pushing up Shizuru&#39;s top, slowly 
exposing the creamy skin to her eager mouth. Shizuru held her breath, as 
Natsuki kissed her way up, tasting each new inch of skin that was 
uncovered. Once she reached her bra, Natsuki pushed the sweater up over 
her chest and took in the sight of Shizuru&#39;s chest, covered by a lacy, 
white satin bra. Natsuki smiled at her friend&#39;s simple yet sexy choice 
of lingerie. As a connoisseur of fine undergarments, Natsuki had many 
more unique articles in her collection than the one on the girl before 
her, but she felt that nothing could look more sexy and alluring than 
Shizuru did right now in that classic white bra.

She hovered over Shizuru&#39;s chest, looking up to meet her friend&#39;s eyes 
before she proceeded. The look in Shizuru&#39;s eyes made her heart beat 
faster, and she could sense the bubbling desire and anticipation in the 
other girl&#39;s gaze. Without pause, she bent down to kissed the tops of 
Shizuru&#39;s breasts before pulling the cup down to reveal her dusky pink 
nipple. She kissed the center experimentally, before taking it into her 
mouth. Shizuru gasped out her name as she swirled her tongue around her 
hardening nipple while simultaneously sucking on the tender flesh.

Natsuki could feel herself getting hotter as she lost herself in the 
smell and taste of Shizuru&#39;s skin. When she moved over to lavish her 
other breast with attention, Shizuru was no less responsive as she 
sighed and moaned in pleasure. Wanting better access, Natsuki reached 
behind the other girl&#39;s back and unhooked her bra, tossing it aside. She 
then pulled Shizuru&#39;s top the rest of the way off, fully exposing her 
naked upper torso. She was beautiful to behold, and Natsuki became even 
further aroused by the sensuality radiating from her heated skin.

Suddenly wanting to feel Shizuru&#39;s skin against her own, Natsuki sat up 
and yanked her long-sleeved shirt up over her head and unclasped her 
bra, letting the straps slide down her arms. Before she could lean back 
down to press herself against the other girl&#39;s body, Shizuru sat up, 
pulling Natsuki into her lap, and began kissing the younger girl&#39;s 
breasts, unable to resist the temptation presented before her. Natsuki 
threw her head back in pleasure, a cry issuing from her throat. The 
sensations were beyond anything she had ever felt, and she leaned 
forward to cradle Shizuru&#39;s head to her, resting her forehead on the top 
of the other girl&#39;s head.

Shizuru made sure to repay Natsuki for her earlier actions, as she 
sucked and licked each of the girl&#39;s breasts. She teased both nipples 
with her fingers, rolling and pinching them, while she moved her lips to 
suck and bite on Natsuki&#39;s collarbone. Suddenly, wanting nothing more 
than to kiss Shizuru&#39;s lips, Natsuki stood up, pulling the other girl 
with her. Wrapping her arms around her, she crushed Shizuru to her chest 
and brought her lips to the other girl&#39;s, kissing her deeply. The feel 
of their bare breasts pressed against one another made each girl moan 
loudly into the kiss.

Shizuru made the next move, grinding her hips against Natsuki&#39;s, the 
layers of clothing doing nothing to disguise the unbidden want implied 
by the action. She then fingered the button on Natsuki&#39;s jeans, and 
grabbing the waistband, ran her fingers inside it, brushing the skin of 
Natsuki&#39;s lower torso. Natsuki&#39;s body shuddered with pleasure, tensing 
as Shizuru unbuttoned and began unzipping her jeans.

As Shizuru began pushing down her jeans, a cell phone suddenly 
rang,cutting through the fog of passion that had overtaken the two of 
them.

Letting out a frustrated moan, Shizuru went to her purse and retrieved 
her phone. Her caller ID showed that it was her mother calling so she 
reluctantly answered the call, giving Natsuki an apologetic look.

Deciding to let Shizuru talk to her mother in private, Natsuki went to 
her bathroom. She placed her shaking hands on the edge of the vanity, 
the excitement of the moment still making her body on edge. It felt so 
good to be with Shizuru like that, and she idly wondered how far they 
might have gone if they hadn&#39;t been interrupted. The next time they made 
it to this point she was sure she wouldn&#39;t be able to stop herself. 
Splashing water on her face, she forced herself to calm down and to make 
her heart rate return to normal so that she could go talk to Shizuru.

She went to the doorway and peeked down the hall, taking in the sight of 
a half-naked Shizuru talking on her cell phone in the living room. The 
spark of desire she suddenly felt slightly shocked her. Shizuru had a 
beautiful body, a fact she had noted on prior occasions at the public 
bath. Never would Natsuki have guessed that she would be looking at said 
body while thinking the types of thoughts that were currently running 
through her head.

All of a sudden she remembered the marriage arrangement and the fact 
that they hadn&#39;t come up with a solution yet. A wave of nausea passed 
over her as an unbidden thought surfaced in her mind of Shizuru 
belonging to some unknown man. She walked out into the living room as 
Shizuru was finishing up her conversation and closing her phone, causing 
the taller girl to gasp as she was encircled from behind by Natsuki&#39;s 
arms.

&quot;I&#39;m never letting you go,&quot; Natsuki stated, a hint of desperation in her 
voice.

&quot;You won&#39;t ever have to, I&#39;ll always be yours,&quot; Shizuru said 
comfortingly. Her voice changed to a sadder tone and she said, &quot;My 
parents have arranged...for me to meet with him tomorrow afternoon.&quot;

&quot;What! Are you serious?&quot; Shocked, she released her hold on Shizuru.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid so...I don&#39;t really have a choice but to go meet with him. I 
have no way to excuse myself, as my parents know I have no plans or 
appointments scheduled tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Shit!&quot; Natsuki muttered under her breath as she began massaging her 
temples.

Shizuru took Natsuki into her arms and stroked her hair. &quot;It will be 
fine; it&#39;s just a meeting after all, right? Maybe he&#39;ll think I&#39;m ugly 
and not his type and call off the wedding.&quot;

Somehow, Natsuki didn&#39;t think that was possible.

&quot;Or maybe I could accidentally spill some hot tea in his lap, that would 
send him running,&quot; she joked in an attempt to soothe her upset 
companion. She was startled when Natsuki looked up at her with tears 
welling upin her eyes.

&quot;Please don&#39;t cry Natsuki,&quot; she pleaded, the sight of the crying girl 
paining her greatly. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we still have time to figure 
something out, ok?&quot; She gently wiped the tears from Natsuki&#39;s face and 
then held her tightly.

&quot;Did your mom say you had to go home now?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid so, she wants me to be up early tomorrow so that Iwill be 
prepared to meet him for lunch and tea.&quot;

&quot;Seriously, you should do whatever you can to make him not like you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do what I can, but I cannot tarnish my family&#39;s good name and 
reputation by acting improperly.&quot;

Natsuki sighed, &quot;Well, call me as soon as you can tomorrow after your 
lunch.&quot;

&quot;I will.&quot;

Wrapped in one another&#39;s arms, they noticed they were still half-naked 
from their previous activities. They separated quickly, knowing Shizuru 
would be late getting home if they resumed what they had been engaged in 
before the phone call. They got dressed and left the apartment, Natsuki 
giving Shizuru a ride back home on her motorcycle. After a lingering 
kiss and whispered endearments, Natsuki watched Shizuru&#39;s retreating 
back as she walked down the long driveway to her family estate. Once she 
was out of view she throttled her bike and raced back home, trying to 
ignore the feelings of helplessness creeping into her heart.
