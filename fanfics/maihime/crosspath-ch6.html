Day 75

The threatening notes have stopped appearing in my
locker, thankfully, and I notice that the gossip about
me is also grinding to a halt. It looks like the
scandal of Miss Fujino and Miss Kuga being caught
doing what they were doing out in the rose garden has
overtaken any interest in me. It&#39;s a bit of a relief,
honestly, even though I do feel a bit sorry for
Natsuki.

Day 76

Natsuki and Shizuru both appeared before the student
council to apologize over the garden incident. I think
I was one of the few people there trying to take it
seriously, considering Reito&#39;s barely concealed
chuckles, Alyssa&#39;s impish smirk and Miss Yukino&#39;s
smile. Add to that Shizuru&#39;s easy charm and Natsuki&#39;s
blushes as they tried to explain and even I was having
difficulty being serious.

We also had a unexpected guest that day, Miss Haruka
Suzushiro the former head of the Executive. It seems
that Miss Suzushiro had some kind of feud with Shizuru
while they were both classmates at Fuka, and she came
hoping to see her rival brought down a bit. Of course
she left annoyed as Shizuru seemed entirely
unrepentant.

It was strange.. I had heard all the rumors about how
close Yukino and Haruka had been, but it was very
different to see it all played out right in front of
me. The two fell into what must have been a familiar
pattern between them, with Haruka leading and Yukino
following, and I was shocked at how angry it made me.
All the current members of the student council knew
how capable of a leader Yukino was, how come Haruka
couldn&#39;t?

Day 79

With President Kanzaki&#39;s permission I took a day out
away from the student council&#39;s business, to try to
understand my reactions yesterday. Looking back at my
feelings towards Haruka&#39;s arrival, I realize I felt
jealous of her taking Yukino&#39;s time and attention
away. But why should I feel that? Yukino is my senpai
on the student council and I&#39;d like to think we&#39;re
friends, but there&#39;s no more to it than that.

Or is there? I find myself feeling less and less hurt
over Nina Wong&#39;s rejection of me, but is that because
I&#39;ve put someone else in her place? Am I merely
substituting one hopeless infatuation for another, or
just confusing honest admiration with a deeper
feeling? I don&#39;t know, and until I do know I dare not
act.

Day 81

I think it would help me maintain some perspective on
Yukino if she&#39;d stop being so nice to me. On the first
council meeting back from my day off Yukino helped
catch me up, not to mention having handled the
executive and secretarial duties. She just smiled as I
thank her, explaining she felt sure I would do the
same for her. Well, I think I would try at least.

The meeting itself was mostly dry stuff including a
proposal for a actual campus police force, built from
the executive committee. Yukino feels that a ad-hoc
organization like the executive is useful for
emergencies, but day to day activities must also be
handled. Yukino pointed out that while the executive
were willing they were mostly untrained. Reito and
Alyssa agreed to consider the proposal, then discuss
it next meeting.

The latest rumor going around is that Mai and Mikoto
have finally become a official couple. I&#39;m not
surprised people think that, considering how
affectionate they can be with one another, but I saw
them kissing in one of the stairways today. My only
surprise was how Mikoto seemed the more aggressive of
the pair...

Day 82

Yukino came to me to let me know that the executive
committee and friends were having another kareoke
night, and that I was invited. I was rather doubtful,
considering what happened last time, but Yukino
assured me that Aoi would be keeping a eye on Chie and
they were having a teacher supervise. She also doesn&#39;t
fight fair, holding on to my hands while looking into
my eyes... how could I say no?

Day 84

On the day before the party Nina Wong finally came to
me to talk, and it was about as awkward as I had
expected it to be. She confessed that she had been
startled by the rumors of my feelings towards her.
Nina apologized for overreacting, which I thought was
a bit of a understatement, and hoped our friendship
might be what it once was. Of course, I noticed she
didn&#39;t invite me to sit with her at lunch like before,
so I&#39;m not sure how sincere she was.

Day 85

My resolutions for the night were fairly simple: don&#39;t
embarrass myself and don&#39;t let myself over drink
again. I didn&#39;t actually manage to keep either
resolution, but things didn&#39;t turn out that badly for
me. The teachers supervising ended up being nurse
Yohko and Midori, both of whom were far too occupied
with drinking and each other to watch over us, so
things got out of hand pretty quickly.

And then there were the costumes. Mai Tokiha insisted
on wearing a police woman&#39;s for old times sake,
whatever that meant, and I found myself gulping when
Yukino emerged in a red Chinese dress that hugged
every curve. Then she proceeded to sing a old love
song, fumbling occasionally but still bringing a tear
to the eye.

Nao seemed intent on having me drink, though I mostly
managed to turn her offers down. I do remember getting
kind of blurry as the night went on, so I suspect
someone was adding booze to my soda. I&#39;m pretty sure I
remember at least one costume change, though to be
honest I don&#39;t recall what they put me in... just
Yukino&#39;s wide eyed look as I sang.

Day 86

I have SUCH a hangover. More later.

Later

Why did Chie have to have a camera phone handy? I
hadn&#39;t realized quite how skimpy that barbarian outfit
Aoi helped me into was. The fake leather top was
clearly showing the edges of my nipples, and the
bikini bottom was a bit too small, too. I also have no
memory of whatever I sang, tho Mikoto tells me it went
over well.

On the plus side, Chie has already printed me up a
picture of Yukino dressed in both the Chinese dress as
well as a cute &#39;Joan of Arc&#39; like design. Both are
adorable, and I intend to keep them. And I got prints
of most of the others&#39; costumes too.

Day 88

Nina, Arika and I had lunch together, along with a
young man I suspect is Nina&#39;s new boyfriend. I&#39;m
curiously not bothered about Sergei, but more by
Nina&#39;s need to introduce him to me. Is this her way of
proving she&#39;s straight? Or am I just reading too much
into it?

My impression of Sergei himself is that he&#39;s a nice
young man, maybe a year or so older than Nina. When
she left the table he was quite polite, and while he
seemed aware of the rumors around me he wasn&#39;t
bothered by them. All in all I think I like him.
Arika, on the other hand, was remarkably bristly
towards him. I can&#39;t tell if she&#39;s annoyed for my sake
or just didn&#39;t warm up to him, but they clashed almost
from the start.

Day 89

Miss Midori continues to be the jack of all trades
teacher, subbing in as needed in various classes. Last
time it was Chemistry, now she&#39;s doing English. It
doesn&#39;t get much funnier than seeing your teacher
mangling a great work of literature, then taking turns
with the rest of the class correcting her.

Day 92

Monday, and the highlight of my day was sharing lunch
with Yukino. Nina and Sergei were eating together and
I couldn&#39;t see Arika, so it was quite a relief to have
Yukino beckon me over. We talked and chatted as we
ate, but I kept finding myself distracted by gazing
into Yukino&#39;s eyes behind those cute glasses and
watching her mouth move. She worriedly asked what was
wrong when I failed to answer her, and I had to
stammer a reply.

Yukino just smiled and told me that she got distracted
too, at times.

Day 95

I think I&#39;ve made up my mind to seriously look at my
attraction to Yukino. Just ignoring it has failed, in
fact I find myself paying more and more attention to
her, both in student council and when we spend time
together. I find myself looking for the weakest
excuses to spend time with her, and when she smiles at
me I think I might fly away.

Of course, what to do about it is the question. I have
no idea how she&#39;d react to a younger woman asking her
out, and to be honest I&#39;m afraid to find out, in case
it&#39;s bad news. Maybe I need to ask for some advice...?

Day 96

After some debate, I decided it might be best to talk
to Aoi. Chie might have been a better choice, but I&#39;d
be too worried about her deciding to spread a rumor
around. I also considered asking Natsuki, but to be
honest I&#39;m too scared of her. While Yukino and the
others have reassured me her reputation is worse than
the reality, her occasionally chilling stare is more
than I could take.

Aoi sat me down with some tea while Chie was out, and
I hesitantly explained my growing feelings for Yukino.
She seemed oddly unsurprised, and I wonder how
transparent I&#39;ve been the last little while. Still,
Aoi was kind as she listened, then offered some quite
good advice.
