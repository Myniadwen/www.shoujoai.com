<p>“How long do you plan to stay?”</p>
<p>“I…I haven’t really decided yet…”</p>
<p>Saeko  and Natsuki Kruger now stood in what was the lady politician’s  temporary residence, a fancy hotel located about a block away from the  Vedelian Senate building, actually finding some time to talk since the  current political meeting was in recess for the remainder of the day.</p>
<p>Natsuki  had actually sat in during part of the session, watching her mother’s  calm composure and undeniable strength. She was an amazing public  speaker, a part of the girl had always known that about her mother, but  her respect for the woman to be able to demand the attention of these  other politicians, especially the ones whom they had just recently  considered their enemy, was surely remarkable.</p>
<p>She had never  considered herself much of a talker, instead Natsuki always proved  herself through her actions, earning other’s respect in her own way.  Even so, she couldn’t help but wonder if somewhere deep inside she had  inherited that spectacular gift of her mother’s to fight battles with  words. One thing for sure, however, was that to do what Saeko was  doing, one need an abundance of patience, and that was something that  the eighteen year old often lacked. Perhaps it would come with age, she  thought.</p>
<p>But now she stood before this amazing woman, trying to express her wish to return to Windbloom.</p>
<p>With  a sigh, the older woman removed her glasses, and retrieving a  handkerchief from her coat pocket, began to wipe off the thin lenses,  “I guess there’s no changing your mind, is there?”</p>
<p>Pulling out  one of the chairs from beneath the small table in the room, Natsuki sat  down, “There are just things that I need to take care of,  mother…Questions that need to be answered…people I want to see…”</p>
<p>“Now though? Do you have to go <em>now</em>?” Saeko questioned, the yearning in her voice threatening to break her daughter’s willpower.</p>
<p>“I  watched part of that meeting today,” the girl began, “you seem like you  have things under control, mom. There’s not much I can do while both  sides are talking anyway.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that, Natsuki…I just wanted  to be with my daughter after all this time…during this peace that we  both fought so hard for.”</p>
<p>“Mom…”</p>
<p>“Is that so wrong of me?”</p>
<p>“No,  of course not…But it’s not like I’ll be gone forever, and when I come  back with that GEM, just think of all the good we can do for Vedel. We  can help protect our country together.”</p>
<p>Closing the distance between them, Saeko knelt down by her daughter, wrapping her arms tightly around the girl.</p>
<p>“M-Mom—?”</p>
<p>“Your father…would be so proud of you, Natsuki. I know he’s proud of you.”</p>
<p>Fighting back her tears, Natsuki silently returned the embrace.</p>
<p>Eventually breaking apart, the older woman remained kneeling on the floor, “So, when is the plane departing?”</p>
<p>Natsuki smirked, not surprised that her mother was aware of her planning, “Tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p>“I see…And you just <em>knew</em> that you’d be able to convince me, huh?”</p>
<p>“Well, I am your daughter after all.”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
To  Natsuki, the flight back to Windbloom had seemed to be much longer than  when she had flown from the place to Vedel, maybe on account of the  various emotions that kept surging through her head.
<p>She was excited. She wanted to see Shizuru again. To tell her  everything that had happened back home. Well, on second thought,  perhaps not <em>everything</em>…she could definitely skip out on a few  horrifying details and experiences she had encountered without spoiling  too much of the story.</p>
<p>Natsuki was also dying to hear about Mai.  If she had ever returned to Garderobe…what her final decision was…She  had hated to leave for home when she desperately wanted to look for her  friend, but it was far too late for regrets now.</p>
<p>And part of her  was a little nervous about facing the Headmistress after her near  three-month absence. Would the woman still present her with a GEM? Had  her leaving diminished her chance of still becoming an Otome?</p>
<p>Stepping  out of the cab, Natsuki progressed down the hedge-lined walkway,  stopping in front of the black cast-iron gates at the end of the path  that guarded the entrance to the school. Gazing up at the mighty  structure at the top of the endless steps, a smile crept across her  face.</p>
<p>As much as Vedel was home, so was this place.</p>
<p>Maneuvering  over to the right side of the gates, she pressed the small button on  the brick wall, and almost instantaneously, the small screen flickered  to life.</p>
<p>“How may I help yo—K-Kruger-san!?”</p>
<p>“Uh…Y-Yeah…I was hoping to speak with the Headmistress…”</p>
<p>“O-Of course! Come right in, I’ll inform Oleander-sama of your arrival immediately.”</p>
<p>The monitor faded back to black, and a loud <em>‘clank’ </em>alerted  the girl that the gate was now unlocked. Natsuki quickly entered,  making sure to shut the bars behind her, before making her way to the  elevator that could take her to the school grounds.</p>
<p>The hum of  the elevator’s engine was all that kept her company on the sloped  ascent, and the girl absentmindedly tugged at the strap lying across  her torso. Glancing down at the arm resting in the sling, Natsuki  frowned slightly. She was sure the metal device would win her an  overload of questions, and she definitely wasn’t looking forward to it.  Really there were only a handful of individuals she wanted to talk to,  but somehow she didn’t think she’d be lucky enough to evade all the  others.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before the elevator came to a halt, and  when it did, Natsuki began walking towards the building that housed the  Gakeunchou’s office, the receptionist from before coming out to meet  her.</p>
<p>“Kruger-san, welcome back,” the girl addressed her, bowing politely, “Please, follow me.”</p>
<p>As  Natsuki followed the guide through the hallways of the Academy, not  that she needed one of course, she could practically feel the eyes of  the younger girls they passed lingering on her. There was no disrespect  intended by any of them, in fact, most bowed as she walked by, many of  the older girl’s recognizing her almost immediately while the new  underclassmen whispered amongst themselves about the <em>“mysterious dark-haired woman”</em>.  The Otome-turned-soldier merely nodded her recognition, and couldn’t  help but feel a little out of place amongst these feminine uniforms  while in her military one.</p>
<p>Once the two had finally cleared the  bustling hallway and entered the staff area, Natsuki released the  breath she just now noticed that she had been holding. A short distance  later, and the two were standing in front of the sturdy oak door that  led to the Gakenchou’s office. The Pearl in front of her opened the  door, and Natsuki whispered her thanks as she proceeded through,  hearing the soft sound of it closing behind her once she was inside.</p>
<p>Lucretia Oleander stood across the room quietly gazing out the giant windows, keeping to this activity even as she spoke.</p>
<p>“Natsuki Kruger…I knew you would be back.”</p>
<p>Finally  turning, the emerald-eyed girl noticed that the woman had a contented  smile on her face as she approached, stopping a few feet away.</p>
<p>“Headmistress Oleander-sama.”</p>
<p>The  Column took a moment to gaze over the girl in front of her, “I’m glad  to see that you’re still in one piece. If you’re here, does that mean  that the fighting in Vedel has been resolved?”</p>
<p>“For the most part, yes. Both sides are in peaceful negotiations at the moment, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“That’s  good to hear. I’m sure you’re quite happy about this,” Lucretia  remarked, motioning towards the couch and chairs, which the two  promptly sat it.</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“So, what brings you back to Garderobe, Miss Kruger?”</p>
<p>Natsuki cleared her throat before proceeding, “I had some questions for you, Headmistress, if I may.”</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>“Mai…what became of her?”</p>
<p>“I’m  afraid I don’t have an answer for that,” Lucretia replied, blue eyes  dimming slightly, “We’ve neither seen nor heard anything of the girl.”</p>
<p>“Nothing at all?” Natsuki desperately questioned, to which she only received a solemn shake of the head.</p>
<p>“I see,” she mumbled, hands clinching before the left painfully reminded her that it was still quite broken, “Headmistress?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“About the GEM I was to receive—”</p>
<p>“It was destroyed,” Oleander-sama answered before she could even finish.</p>
<p>“Wh-What?”</p>
<p>“I had Yohko dissolved it a long time ago.”</p>
<p>“B-But…why?”</p>
<p>“That GEM was never truly meant for you, Natsuki.”</p>
<p>Despite  her best efforts, Natsuki couldn’t hold back the spark that flared in  her eyes, “Then what was all of this for? Four years of training and  studying…for what? I was supposed to become an Otome for my  homeland...Had you planned this all along?”</p>
<p>“<em>That</em> GEM was  never meant for you because there is a far greater one that you  deserve,” the older woman snapped back, her own emotions slipping  through.</p>
<p>The dark-haired girl across the table was completely  taken aback, mouth gaping, incapable of stringing together a complete  sentence.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“The Ice Silver Crystal—“</p>
<p>Emerald eyes widened.</p>
<p>“—the GEM that resides on my ear at this very moment…This is the GEM. <em>Your</em> GEM.”</p>
<p>“O-Oleander…sama…”</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> are the one who should inherit it, Natsuki. I want you to take my place as Headmistress of Garderobe Academy.”</p>
<p>Natsuki, still dumbstruck at the woman’s words, could only blink, “But…Gakuenchou…”</p>
<p>“Of  all my years here at Garderobe…of all the girl’s I’ve seen come and go  from this school, you have been the only one that I’ve truly believed  could take over this position. Granted there is still room for  improvement, and there are still quite a few things that need to be  covered, but the potential is certainly there,” Lucretia informed her,  pointedly shaking a single finger in the air.</p>
<p>“I…I…” the girl uttered, gaze averting to the ground.</p>
<p>With  a small sigh, the woman continued, “Look, I cannot force anything upon  you, Natsuki. The choice, whether I like it or not, is ultimately up to  you. But please, listen to me. I’ve seen the determined young lady that  you are, and the strong woman that you can become. I believe  wholeheartedly that you could do great things for this school…and for  Earl as a whole, so I ask that you please consider it. Do not rush the  decision…take your time…And in the meantime, we’ll start your lessons.”</p>
<p>The  weight of seriousness over the room seemed to disperse with that last  statement, and Natsuki lifted her head to meet the Headmistress’  quizzically.</p>
<p>“Lessons?”</p>
<p>“Yes. They’ll start when you get back.”</p>
<p>“’<em>When I get back’</em>? Where am I going?”</p>
<p>“Well, you do want to see <em>her</em>, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“<em>Her…Shizuru…”</em> the girl thought, a warm smiled spreading on her face, all of the  previous conversation seemingly swept away for the time being.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I do.”</p>
