<p>“<em>Natsuki…could you…Do you…?”</em></p>
<p>Now  in the safe solitude of the moving limousine, the Graceful Amethyst  touched her lips lightly with trembling fingers, noting for the first  time how cold they felt without the warm pressure she had experienced  just minutes before.</p>
<p>“<em>It’s…not like you…to do such a thing…”</em></p>
<p>In  all the years she had known the younger girl, Natsuki had never been  one to openly or easily express her feelings, especially in any kind of  physical sense. In fact, she even tended to stiffen at any intimate  contact, so to say that Shizuru was shocked by the sudden action would  be an understatement. What could have brought up this kind of reaction  in Natsuki? The older woman asked herself this simple yet immensely  complicated question over and over again, not being able to come up  with a clear conclusion.</p>
<p>“<em>Natsuki has always been a very important person to me, but…I never sensed that she…cared for more than a friend would…”</em></p>
<p>Was  that it? Did the stubborn girl actually have feelings for her? No…How  could that be? Shizuru had always sensed the admiration the younger  girl had for her, a respect for her abilities as an Otome. That was the  first emotion she had received from her dark-haired underclassman.  Shizuru’s teasing had been the next stage. She had played with Natsuki  like she did many of the other girl’s at Garderobe, though she had to  admit that the reactions that she received from the emerald-eyed  Vedelian were surely her favorite. In time, however, the two had  actually grown to become friends, and gradually, Shizuru became aware  that maybe Natsuki meant more to her than her usual admirers. But had  there been any signs from the younger girl that she herself might feel  the same?</p>
<p>Only one specific memory surfaced in Shizuru’s mind…</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em><strong>Three years ago…</strong></em>
<p><em>It was another warm evening in the kingdom of Windbloom, a slight  breeze pushing the few thin clouds present in the sky at a leisurely  pace to cover the moon and it’s dim light on occasion. On the Garderobe  campus, due to the strict curfew, all of the students were currently in  their rooms, some studying, others sleeping, with the exception of two  girl’s whom were both at the top of their class.</em></p>
<p><em>The  crimson-eyed Pearl sat in the garden gazebo, patiently awaiting the  arrival of her younger companion, silently pondering if the girl had  managed to slip out of the dorms without getting caught. Reassurance  came, however, when quick, quiet footsteps were detected from that  darkened pathway, and moments later, a shadowed figure did appear.</em></p>
<p><em>At  a brisk jog, Natsuki closed the distance between herself and the small  white structure, her mane as dark as the night sky weightlessly flowing  behind her.</em></p>
<p><em>When she finally stopped, her breathing  slightly more labored than normal, Natsuki gazed into the ruby orbs of  her Onee-sama who immediately stood at her presence.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Your letter…” emerald-eyed Coral coolly stated.</em></p>
<p><em>Without a reply, the older girl walked up to Natsuki, whisking her into a strong embrace.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Sh-Shizuru Onee-sama? What’s wrong?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Hm? Nothing.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>To meet in private at such a time…Was there something you wanted to discuss?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>I wanted to see Natsuki,” came the simple response as sneaky hands found their way underneath the girl’s white athletic top.</em></p>
<p><em>Flinching  at the touch, Natsuki broke free of the girl, creating a distance  between them before spinning around with thinned jade eyes containing  both anger and hurt.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Natsu—”</em></p>
<p>“<em>I thought you  wanted to talk about something important…And all you wanted me for  was…was…,” the dark-haired girl stammered, fists clenching as her brow  creased further, “If you just wanted someone to play with, then call  one of your obsessive followers to be your little toy.”</em></p>
<p><em>Natsuki  seemed to spit the words at her in disgust, and Shizuru was rendered  both speechless and immobile even as the young girl sprinted past her,  easily disappearing into the night.</em></p>
<p><em>It was a few days later that Shizuru finally found the courage to apologize to her friend. </em></p>
<p><em>It  was one evening after dinner that she positioned herself outside of the  door of the room that Natsuki shared with her fellow Coral, Mai Tokiha.  Lightly rapping on the door with her knuckles, the chestnut-haired girl  could hear muffled voices exchanging words before she heard one of the  occupants approaching the door, but when the door did creak open, she  was met with the orange hair and violet eyes of Natsuki’s roommate  rather than Natsuki herself. </em></p>
<p>“<em>Shizuru Onee-sama?” Mai mumbled, obviously surprised to see the older girl.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Good evening, Mai-san. Is Natsuki there?” Shizuru asked, even though she knew very well that the girl was indeed inside.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Uh…” the busty girl muttered before glancing back over her shoulder.</em></p>
<p><em>A very distinct, not to mention annoyed, huff was heard, along with the rustling of sheets as Natsuki turned over in her bed.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Eh, I’m afraid she’s not feeling very well today, Onee-sama…” Mai said, scratching her chin with an apologetic smile.</em></p>
<p>“<em>I see,” the older Pearl remarked, containing her usual airy cheerfulness, “Then, please, give her my regards.”</em></p>
<p><em>With  a slight bow, Shizuru took off down the hall, and closing the door  behind her, Mai sighed as she leaned against the sturdy wooden  structure. </em></p>
<p>“<em>Mou, Natsuki,” the redhead whined, “what  happened between you and Shizuru Onee-sama? You’re usually jumping at  any opportunity to spend time with her…”</em></p>
<p>“<em>I’m not talking with her,” the raven-haired girl childishly stated.</em></p>
<p><em>Making her way over to her friend’s bed, Mai sat on the edge, leaning back on her hands.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Is that why you’ve been so moody lately? Well, moodier than normal...”</em></p>
<p><em>The only response she received was a snort and a slight movement underneath the bedcovers as the girl repositioned herself.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Really…If you don’t want to talk with me about it, you should at least sort things out with Onee-sama herself, you know.”</em></p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“<em>Natsuki?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>I  heard you the first time, alright?!” Natsuki shot back, knowing very  well that Mai was right, but certainly not wanting to admit it.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Then you’re definitely going to talk to her tomorrow, right? And sort things out?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Yes,” came the short, snappy reply.</em></p>
<p><em>Smiling triumphantly, Mai returned to her bed to continue flipping through the magazine she had been looking at before.</em></p>
<p><em>The  next day at lunch, Natsuki promptly pulled Shizuru to the side before  the older girl could get in line for her meal. Perplexed, but still  craving the opportunity to apologize for the other night, Shizuru had  willingly complied, and in silence, both girl’s left the cool school  building as they walked outside in the Spring heat.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Natsuki, about—“</em></p>
<p>“<em>No. I want to say what I need to say first,” the Coral rudely cut her sempai off.</em></p>
<p><em>Rather than argue, Shizuru consented with a nod.</em></p>
<p>“<em>When  I found that letter from you sitting on my desk, I thought there was  something that you seriously wanted to speak with me about. I didn’t  care what it was, but I though you needed help…and you were asking me  of all people to be the one to help you with whatever problem you had…”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Natsuki…”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Of  course, in the end it wasn’t anything like that, was it? What you  did…it hurt me, Onee-sama. It made me think, ‘does she not take me  seriously?’”</em></p>
<p><em>Stopping in her walking, Natsuki turned to her upperclassman who did the same.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Do  you not take me seriously? Am I just another person for you to tease  and mess with? Because I…I thought we were more than that…I thought we  were friends…I want us to be friends…”</em></p>
<p><em>A sad smile forming  on her lips, Shizuru softly, genuinely, took the girl in her arms,  “Kanin na, Natsuki…I haven’t thought of your feelings at all, have I?”</em></p>
<p><em>Awkwardly, the dark-haired girl shook her head that was currently buried in Shizuru’s shoulder.</em></p>
<p>“<em>I’m so sorry,” the russet-eyed Pearl whispered, “…so sorry…”</em></p>
<p><em>Finally  pulling apart, Shizuru gazed down at the shorter girl, “I truly do  consider Natsuki as a very special friend, and if she’ll let me, I’d  like the opportunity to prove that to her.”</em></p>
<p><em>With a small smile of her own, Natsuki nodded her approval.</em></p>
<p><em>Giving her underclassman a quick peck on the cheek, Shizuru linked her arm with Natsuki’s, causing the younger girl to blush.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Ookini,”  Shizuru stated, slipping into her usual cheeriness, “Well then, shall  we return to the cafeteria? We should still have time for a quick  lunch.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Mmh. That sounds good,” Natsuki replied, the two reconciled girl’s making their way back inside the academy.</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“<em>That was the first time I ever saw how dearly you held our relationship,”</em> Shizuru thought to herself with a smile.
<p>But was it possible that the younger girl held her even closer to  her heart than she had ever realized? Shizuru couldn’t be sure, and it  seemed it would be a while before she would have the chance to ask  Natsuki that very question as the limousine pulled up to the station  that housed the giant dessert transit that would take her to  Romulus…and further away from Natsuki.</p>
