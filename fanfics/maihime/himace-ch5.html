<h1>Mai HiMACE (part 5 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/226.html">22671991</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/himace-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>By dawn, the sky had cleared up considerably. All the cloud, wind and 
rain from the night before had disappeared completely, as if they had 
never even been in the first place. The sky just after sunrise was a 
deep ocean blue, smattered here and there with thick clumps of soft, 
fluffy white clouds. The sun was already drifting up through the sky 
before anyone had the time to notice, sliding up off the horizon, the 
last few tinges of pink across the bottom edges of the clouds slowly 
fading away. It was a beautiful, pastel-coloured kind of sky that 
morning, so quiet and peaceful, with only the sounds of a few scattered 
birds chirping away in the trees around the city. Such a beautiful 
morning indeed.

The kind of morning she would have loved.

Arika breathed a regretful sigh. Brand new world to live in, all kinds 
of strange things to explore, so many new people to meet and places to 
go, such endless adventure to be had. Despite it all, here she was stuck 
in a hotel room with Nina, under orders to stay put. She couldn&#39;t even 
get out and enjoy the morning air, or go walk around in that huge park 
down behind the hotel. It was like being stuck in a gourmet restaurant 
with plenty of money, but then told that you couldn&#39;t order anything.

&quot;Well,&quot; she huffed to herself, &quot;like Granny says, &quot;if you give 
something, you&#39;ll get something back&quot;...I think.&quot; She shook her head. 
&quot;Besides, I can have fun in here by myself until Miyu gets back.&quot;

&quot;Arika,&quot; came a weak mumble from behind her, back in the room. 
&quot;Arika...where are you? Are you out there?&quot; There was a pause before 
that voice continued, much more irritated, &quot;and what did you do with the 
sheet?&quot;

Arika waited, and waited...and waited. Still, the owner of that voice 
refused to show herself. A minute stretched on for hours, or maybe she 
just had no patience, until she eventually turned about on one foot and 
slid the curtain aside to let the morning sunlight into the room. Nina 
yelped at first, clutching her hands up to try to cover herself lest 
anyone be looking in from outside. When she looked up again, however, 
her attention was well and truly diverted.

Instead of Arika standing on the balcony naked, or dressed in part of 
the curtains or some other strange collection of articles as Nina might 
have expected, there was a very different person standing there.

Perhaps yes, she was a little short, but she did indeed look quite the 
young girl, her facial features were delicately carved, fine orange 
eyebrows and surprisingly long black lashes that emphasised her deep 
blue eyes. A mildly amused expression was scrawled across her face, her 
eyes sparkling within, her narrow lips curled at their edges, smiling 
softly as she returned the look. Thick orange hair fell to either side 
of her face and down the back of her neck past her shoulders, instead of 
the usual &quot;antennae.&quot; Without that ridiculously childish hairstyle, she 
looked entirely more mature and dignified. The outfit helped 
considerably, of course.

Her shoulders were bare, and all the way down her arms too. In an 
amusing little twist of irony, she had fashioned the same sort of 
halter-top dress as the one she had worn when she had broken into 
Garderobe in the first place and invaded the council hall. This time, 
however, the dress was almost lovingly put together, folded over and 
over without a single cut to create a garment that looked almost as if 
it had been made that way, and held together in a very carefully tied 
knot behind the redhead&#39;s neck. The thin, silken purple fabric flowed 
down over her whole front half in a semi-loose kind of way, only 
gripping to her form by the time it reached her waist, where a thick 
band that could only be the pillowcase had been wrapped around like a 
belt to hold the thing on. From there it expanded outwards again, draped 
down over her legs until it brushed against the floor. Each side ended 
in a corner, and in front left a very small triangular gap where two 
edges intersected, showing only the slightest hint of her bare feet when 
she moved. Nina couldn&#39;t, perhaps thankfully, see what the back looked 
like. She wasn&#39;t really paying attention to that, though.

&quot;You really do look like a princess now,&quot; she said, a little 
absent-mindedly. Arika giggled and Nina felt her face slowly turning as 
red as the other girl&#39;s hair.

&quot;What a thing to say, Nina-chan...but we both know you&#39;re the real 
princess, remember?&quot; Arika grinned her usual mischievous little grin. &quot;I 
should make you something, too! Or maybe we could see how this would 
look on you?&quot;

Nina shook her head, trying to clear out the warm and slightly flustered 
sensation. &quot;I&#39;d prefer real clothes, thank you,&quot; she replied, taking on 
the somewhat snide, dissatisfied expression she had always given Arika 
before. &quot;Besides, what if someone caught you looking like that? Or me, 
for that matter. Walking around dressing like royalty, they&#39;d think we 
were being facetious or something, then we&#39;d be in plenty of 
trouble...what?&quot; Arika was laughing at her, and managing to look and 
sound just as juvenile as she had before despite the almost regal dress.

&quot;Nina,&quot; she laughed between breaths, &quot;who&#39;s going to care? As long as 
we&#39;re not walking around in public in our underwear or something, who&#39;s 
going to come arrest us for dressing the way we want?&quot; Nina blinked. She 
opened her mouth, but a decent argument failed to materialise. &quot;We&#39;re in 
a whole new world, Nina-chan, nobody here knows us. We can be whoever we 
want to be, do whatever we feel like doing.&quot;

&quot;And you just happen to feel like flashing people in public?&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot;

&quot;Standing out there on that balcony naked, what are you thinking?&quot;

Arika waved a dismissive hand, laughing again. &quot;Silly...I wouldn&#39;t do 
something like that. And even if I did, nobody&#39;d see.&quot; She turned round 
and stepped back out onto the balcony, leaving the curtain wide behind 
her. &quot;Come on, come out here and see! It&#39;s such a wonderful view from up 
here...&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Nina frowned. &quot;Besides, I can&#39;t come out there, I&#39;m 
still not dressed yet!&quot;

Arika looked back over her shoulder with a devious little smirk. &quot;The 
only one here to see it is me, and I&#39;ve seen it all before, remember?&quot; 
She laughed yet again when Nina&#39;s face started turning red again. 
&quot;You&#39;re so easy to tease sometimes, Nina-chan, really.&quot;

The back of that dress was just as nice as the front, Nina noticed idly. 
There was nothing above the waist, given the shape of the thing, so the 
redheaded girl&#39;s back was completely exposed from just above the base of 
her spine. Nina noticed several small patches of red and couldn&#39;t keep 
herself from wincing slightly. Thankfully, everything from the waist 
down was obscured by the makeshift skirt, the belt tied off at the small 
of her back in a neat bow. Just like the front, the bottom edge of the 
dress split at the back just slightly to show the slightest glimpse of 
unclad feet beneath.

She shook her head to clear all those strange thoughts and tried taking 
a nice deep breath instead. Slowly, step by step she walked across the 
room to the balcony door until she was stood right behind her roommate, 
hidden from outside view by the edge of the curtain and by the other 
girl&#39;s body. She was just about to take the first step outside, really, 
when Arika grabbed her wrist and pulled her out with a delighted little 
giggle.

It really was beautiful.

Just below, at the base of the hotel, was a narrow garden that looked 
almost overgrown. Doubtless, it had been practically forgotten, hidden 
away behind the building where few would ever see it. Beyond that was a 
sheer drop, a concrete cliff that cut down what must have once been a 
rather steep hill some thirty metres high. A narrow paved road ran along 
the bottom of the wall, and beyond it was another of Tokyo&#39;s famous 
parks, this one leading off into the distance right up to the waterside. 
All around it stretched that huge concrete wall, for what looked like 
many kilometres, with dips cut into it in several places for roads to 
travel down through the park. It was indeed beautiful, yes, and at this 
time of the morning not a sole could be seen.

Nina blinked a little lethargically. &quot;What time is it anyway?&quot;

&quot;Dunno,&quot; shrugged her roommate. &quot;I just got up when the sun rose and 
it&#39;s been about...hmm...couple hours, maybe three?&quot; She grinned 
playfully as she crossed her arms over the balcony railing and leaned up 
against it. &quot;It&#39;s really pretty though, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Arika...&quot;

Arika turned her head again, a puzzled expression on her face. &quot;Hm?&quot;

&quot;A-ri-ka!&quot; The redhead yelped. &quot;It was already dark when we got here! 
After everything we&#39;ve just been through, you still won&#39;t even give me 
more than a few hours&#39; rest!&quot;

&quot;Ah...Nina-chan...wait! Um...I&#39;m sorry?&quot;

Nina put a fingertip to one of the welts on the redhead&#39;s back and poked 
very gently against the skin. &quot;Idiot!&quot; The result was a painful cry as 
Arika&#39;s face scrunched up at the sensation stabbing into her nerves, and 
all the muscles across her back tensed up. She clasped the railing in 
both hands and squeezed so tight her knuckles started paling; her teeth 
caught on her bottom lip and bit down sharply.

Nina pulled her hand away, startled.

&quot;S...sorry.&quot;

Arika shook her head slowly.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m alright,&quot; replied the redhead after a decently lengthy pause. &quot;I&#39;m 
almost healed now, really. It just...still kinda stings a bit.&quot; She 
flinched when she felt a slender fingertip brushing against the skin on 
her lower back, but when the sensation failed to produce the same 
painful stimulus she slowly relaxed back down against the railing.

&quot;That...&quot; Nina swallowed. Quite oblivious to her state of undress by 
now, she stepped up a little closer to the other girl and tipped her 
head down to watch her finger tracing very carefully around the largest 
of those blistered red patches on Arika&#39;s back. &quot;That&#39;s from the fire, 
isn&#39;t it? When you caught me...&quot;

&quot;Actually,&quot; answered the redhead in a much subdued tone of voice, &quot;that 
happened when we landed. The fire wasn&#39;t really that bad, actually.&quot; She 
winced again and Nina&#39;s finger dashed backward away from where it had 
just touched. &quot;If we ever do get home, I&#39;m never going through that 
stupid desert ever again. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll even be able to set foot 
on another beach in my life.&quot; She gave a slow shake of her head, setting 
all that long orange hair a-sway again, and closed her eyes. Silence 
swept back in for a long while, interrupted only by the ever-present 
buzz of cicadas and the occasional chirping of nearby birds. The sun 
drifted gradually ever higher and the pink edges finally disappeared 
from the clouds, even as they began to thin out under the baking assault 
of that bright summer sunlight. It was almost therapeutic, such 
tranquillity, until Arika noticed a very soft sniffling coming from just 
behind her.

Nina looked like she was crying; her head down, lips moving wordlessly, 
a trail of water trickling down her cheek as her fists shook against her 
sides.

&quot;Nina-chan?&quot; Arika reached a tentative hand out to the other girl&#39;s 
shoulder and met no resistance. &quot;Nina, are you okay? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t...I don&#39;t want to go back,&quot; whimpered the dark-haired girl in a 
slightly uneven voice. She shook her head firmly from side to side, as 
if trying to reaffirm herself of her own words, and repeated, in a much 
more forceful tone, &quot;I don&#39;t ever want to go back!&quot;

Arika was, needless to say, more than a little bit shocked by the sudden 
outburst, so that her hand darted away from its intended target as if it 
had been burnt. Her lower lip quivered while words dashed back and forth 
in her head, trying to form into some coherent sentence. &quot;But...&quot; She 
tried reaching back out again rather hesitantly and carried on with the 
first thing that came to mind, &quot;what about...your friends? All the 
people at the academy...and Sergei-&quot;

Nina slapped her hand away.

For a few moments, neither of them could find anything more to say. 
Arika imagined her grandmother sighing disappointedly and shaking her 
head, and that wouldn&#39;t really have surprised her. Stupid.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; mumbled Nina after a considerable pause, and turned her 
back on her companion again. She only managed half a step towards the 
door before a hand grasped firmly on her shoulder and stopped her in her 
tracks.

&quot;Nina, wait... Don&#39;t apologise.&quot; Arika shook her own head, trying for a 
slightly rueful half-grin. &quot;I should be apologising to you. I shouldn&#39;t 
have said something so...&quot;

&quot;...callous?&quot; finished the other girl in a flat tone of voice. &quot;I 
suppose.&quot;

Arika couldn&#39;t keep from chewing on her bottom lip as she put her other 
hand on Nina&#39;s hip and slid a little closer. &quot;Please...don&#39;t be like 
that. I hate to think that we still can&#39;t get along any more, even after 
everything we&#39;ve been through and all.&quot;

Arika waited a painfully long time for a reply, but the dark-haired girl 
seemed resolutely uninterested in continuing the conversation in any 
way. She finally gave up and turned to go back inside when a hand 
clutched tenuously at the side of her improvised dress.

&quot;I don&#39;t...hate you,&quot; muttered Nina uncomfortably. &quot;I never hated you, 
however annoying you might get sometimes. I just...&quot; She trailed off, 
her eyes falling down to the floor to watch her feet shuffle back and 
forth awkwardly. &quot;I just...&quot; She was abruptly cut off when Arika clasped 
arms about her waist and pulled her close. She felt moisture on her 
shoulder, and an unpleasant twist in her stomach when she realised the 
redhead was actually crying.

&quot;I don&#39;t want us to ever fight like that again,&quot; mumbled Arika between 
sniffs. Her hands screwed into fists and pressed tight against Nina&#39;s 
bare shoulder blades. &quot;Because I love you, Nina.&quot; Nina opened her mouth 
to protest, but Arika repeated, more confidently, &quot;I love you.&quot;

Nina felt her arms sliding round that narrow body in return, and just 
held on loosely, trying her own hardest not to cry herself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The pain was unbearable, unimaginable, indescribable. Such agony was 
beyond all the words in all the languages in the world. It was a 
deafening, paralysing, mind-numbing kind of pain. It was...

Haruka flinched. Again.

&quot;Really now, Haruka, I can&#39;t do this if you don&#39;t keep still!&quot;

The mustard-haired woman pouted angrily and buried her face against the 
pillow beneath which her hands were fortunately hidden, clutching tight 
into the mattress, long, manicured fingernails punching holes into the 
fabric. It was painful all right, but she at least had enough pride to 
hide it well. When the stinging swarmed in all over her shoulder blades 
again, she just bit her bottom lip as hard as she could without breaking 
skin and suppressed the tortured squeal that yearned to be let loose.

She whimpered, very softly, under her breath.

On the one hand, it was unbelievably painful. They were only scratches, 
cuts, scrapes, a few slight scorch marks at the very worst, but having 
that damned cloth smeared on them almost felt like someone stabbing her 
in the back with a red-hot lance. Whoever said paper cuts were the worst 
kind of pain had clearly never had this done to them. Furthermore, 
despite having acquired the most ludicrously expensive room in the most 
unspeakably luxurious hotel in the whole city, the bed was rather lumpy 
and the sheet was more than a little rough, which ended up naturally 
rubbing Haruka quite the wrong way.

However, all of the pain and discomfort put together was nothing 
compared to being face-down naked on a strange bed, her similarly nude 
wife straddled across her waist from behind. It was all just a little 
too much to take, almost.

Almost.

The stinging feeling disappeared again after a few moments, and was 
finally replaced with the soothing sensation of a cool, dry cloth of 
some sort being dabbed across the wounds. As she worked on up along all 
those smooth, well-toned back muscles with the one hand, Yukino leant 
forward and planted her other hand on the prone woman&#39;s left shoulder 
and squeezed her fingertips very gently into the edge of Haruka&#39;s 
collarbone.

Very almost. Almost, and getting closer every second.

Yukino sighed again, for about the tenth time that morning, while one 
fingernail traced a delicate pattern around the wounds on her lover&#39;s 
rather badly scored back, including one or two that weren&#39;t exactly 
fresh. Her voice was drifting somewhat wearily from amused to almost 
anxious when she spoke again, &quot;Haruka, really, you should be more 
careful. I&#39;m getting used to doing this for you, and that&#39;s not a good 
thing.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t enjoy this?&quot; Haruka tried to chuckle deviously and instead 
yelped in pain at a finger jabbing between her shoulder blades.

&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant and you know it. You know I don&#39;t like seeing 
you hurt like this,&quot; argued the brunette in an even more insistent tone 
of voice. &quot;One of these days I&#39;m afraid-&quot;

&quot;-Don&#39;t be,&quot; Haruka cut her off, lifting her upper half off the bed with 
her hands and taking her wife&#39;s modest weight in stride. Yukino, for her 
part, seemed completely unfazed by the manoeuvre herself. &quot;It&#39;d take far 
more than a few cuts and bruises to stop the Armitage, and there&#39;s 
certainly nothing I&#39;ve faced yet that could even come close to really 
hurting me.&quot; Yukino opened her mouth, but the mustard-haired woman beat 
her to it yet again, turning over onto her back with those legs still 
wrapped about her waist until she could reach up and tap the brunette&#39;s 
nose with one chiding finger. &quot;Besides, it&#39;s you that I&#39;m worried about, 
personally.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; sighed Yukino, a little resignedly. &quot;Deep down, you&#39;re still 
just the same impudent young girl I used to know, aren&#39;t you? I&#39;m 
certainly never going to get you to stop being so....so...&quot;

&quot;...butch?&quot;

&quot;...reckless,&quot; she finished. &quot;You&#39;re always so impulsive, Haruka-chan, 
always rushing straight into things all the time. Sometimes, I worry I 
don&#39;t know how to keep up with you.&quot; She sighed yet again and laid her 
head down against Haruka&#39;s chest, leaving the cloth in her hand to fall 
off the edge of the bed as she relaxed into place.

&quot;Then tell me off, if that&#39;s what you want. Tell me to stop,&quot; Haruka was 
mumbling in her ear, her voice showing the fatigue of staying up all 
night fighting. &quot;Tell me to quit showing off so much, anything at all. 
You know I&#39;d do it if you told me to...&quot;

Yukino looked up and caught her gaze, a calm, tender kind of glow in her 
more commonly unreadable grey eyes. &quot;I like you just the way you are,&quot; 
she declared firmly, and then kissed the mustard-haired woman right on 
her lips.

&quot;Really?&quot; teased Haruka with a hint of a smirk. For a moment, the 
brunette honestly looked thoughtful, and then finally flashed her own 
grin down at her partner.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s right, actually.&quot; Before Haruka could become 
too confused, she kissed her again, and then clarified, &quot;I love you.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s better.&quot;

Yukino pouted. &quot;Haruka-chan...you&#39;re so mean sometimes.&quot; Haruka just 
grinned at her some more and wound her arms tight around the brunette&#39;s 
body. There was a brief and half-hearted bout of wrestling, which only 
one of them really seemed to put any effort into, and they finally ended 
up back on the bed again in much the same position, except that now 
Yukino found herself trapped underneath the far stronger woman, her arms 
up over her head in a most suggestive pose.

Suddenly, and quite unusually, Haruka sighed. She let go of the other 
woman&#39;s wrists and laid her head down on Yukino&#39;s much less impressive 
chest as one finger found its way to her wife&#39;s stomach to start idly 
tracing out odd little patterns across the skin.

&quot;I can&#39;t enjoy this,&quot; she mumbled, pouting.

&quot;What do you mean you can&#39;t enjoy this?&quot;

Haruka looked up, with an expression that was part irritation and part 
depression. &quot;If we have the most amazing sex ever right now, I&#39;ll still 
be awake all night afterwards stressing over that thing with that stupid 
Orphan.&quot; As much as Yukino might like to congratulate herself at least 
for rubbing the right habits off on her oft dangerously over-worked 
partner, the lack of that usual sparkle in Haruka&#39;s brilliant lavender 
eyes was more than a little worrying. She put her arms around the 
mustard-haired woman&#39;s neck and held tight.

&quot;What about it,&quot; she asked in a soft, soothing tone of voice. &quot;I thought 
you killed it, didn&#39;t you? You got rid of it and that&#39;s that.&quot;

Haruka shook her head. &quot;That&#39;s not it, though,&quot; she protested sharply. 
&quot;I didn&#39;t kill it, that woman did!&quot; She beat her fist very gently 
against the smaller woman&#39;s chest in a half-serious display of anger. &quot;I 
have to find out who she is, and what she has to do with these stupid 
Orphans.&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Well, that depends on who&#39;s asking.&quot;

&quot;You know you can trust me.&quot;

Midori raised an eyebrow. &quot;Do I? How can I be so sure, I mean, you do 
work for the enemy, after all.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve always been sceptical about this project. Having seen what these 
girls have gone through, twice now if not more, I know I&#39;m against 
drawing things out any further. I&#39;d much rather we put them all back 
where they belong and be done with it.&quot;

&quot;And would you say the same for Arika?&quot;

The pink-haired girl hesitated. The spoon in her fingers quivered almost 
imperceptibly. &quot;What kind of a question is that,&quot; she shot back hastily.

&quot;Would you rather stick her back on the streets where we found her?&quot; 
Midori inhaled another chunk of pancake seemingly without stopping to 
chew, and glared across the table. &quot;You think she&#39;d enjoy begging for 
food? Or maybe she&#39;d end up selling her body instead. She&#39;s certainly 
got the kind of figure that men go for these days; so young and-&quot;

&quot;-I get the point! You really have no shame, you know that?&quot; Mashiro 
leant back into her seat, attempting to compose herself while the older 
woman smirked at her across the table. &quot;You certainly know how to push 
people&#39;s buttons, I&#39;ll give you that.&quot;

Midori made a derisive sound. &quot;Speak for yourself. I seem to remember 
you being on the other team on this one.&quot;

&quot;Things change,&quot; the young princess answered softly, her expression at 
last back to normal. &quot;People change too, and not all of us can come out 
of something like this and still be as self-assured as yourself, 
Sugiura-san.&quot; Her face remained almost blank as she continued, &quot;or would 
you rather I call you &quot;Boss&quot; this time?&quot;

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t talk about pushing buttons with tack like that, 
Fumiyoshi-san. I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Midori waved one hand apologetically and 
bowed her head in a show of mock respect, &quot;Queen Mashiro, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

The younger declined to argue, and instead went back to picking away at 
her dessert with the narrow plastic spoon in her hand. Midori waited for 
a moment or two before shrugging and re-asserting her place in the food 
chain above her pancakes. For a short while, neither of them spoke, and 
the sounds of everyday life surrounded them, almost as if everything was 
perfectly normal.

Then Mashiro spoke up.

&quot;Whatever the MIYU is up to, it doesn&#39;t seem to be planning on 
accommodating either of us at any time soon. If I were to guess,&quot; she 
suggested carefully, &quot;I&#39;d say it&#39;s getting more involved with the Gamma 
unit than I&#39;d anticipated.&quot;

Midori set her fork down noisily on the table and glared at her. &quot;They 
have names you know,&quot; she half-growled. &quot;If you really want me to 
believe that you&#39;re working for their benefit, the least you could do is 
show them some respect.&quot;

&quot;Have you forgotten who I am?&quot; Mashiro gestured to herself with one hand 
and out to the crowded restaurant with the other, conservatively of 
course so as not to raise too much unwanted attention. &quot;Being the head 
of an internationally recognised and highly lucrative company makes me 
an easy target for many factions, not the least of which the media. You 
learn to choose your words carefully in a position such as mine.&quot;

&quot;And you forget,&quot; grunted Midori, mouth half full of pancake and syrup 
and pointing at the young businesswoman with her fork, &quot;that the last 
thing your big powerful friends want is public exposure, and that&#39;s just 
what I intend to give them.&quot; She grinned. &quot;Anyhow, what about the 
&#39;droid? Not like I didn&#39;t warn you that it&#39;d be up to something you 
can&#39;t see.&quot;

Mashiro pressed her lips together tightly and squeezed her spoon. 
&quot;Indeed,&quot; she intoned irritably. &quot;It worries me no end, however, knowing 
that someone I&#39;d call a close friend is under the supervision of 
that...thing. I have no way of knowing what it&#39;s been telling her or 
even if she&#39;s still alive by now.&quot;

&quot;Oh she&#39;s alive alright,&quot; chuckled the older woman. &quot;She&#39;s about as 
alive as they come. In fact, the other night, she broke out of the Sixth 
District hospital with her little girlfriend and practically demolished 
part of the building on the way out. Gave one of those &quot;containment&quot; 
bastards a good work-over too,&quot; she finished with a grin, and nodded 
triumphantly. &quot;Nice to know those &#39;stormtroopers&#39; of yours are getting 
just what they deserve.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sure that amused you no end. I hear you met Armitage while you 
were there, as well.&quot;

Midori set her fork down again with a clatter. &quot;They really pulled out 
all the stops with that on, I can tell you that much. She&#39;s built like a 
tank and just about as dangerous. She beat that Orphan to a pulp all by 
herself, hardly even broke a sweat! And she&#39;s about ten times better 
looking in real life...not that I go for that sort of girl, mind you.&quot;

Mashiro tried to hide a blush, and then frowned when her liaison started 
giggling at her like an errant schoolgirl. &quot;You see what I&#39;m trying to 
say of course, your highness? Arika has no home to go back to if we 
abandoned her, and neither do most of the others. Hell, the main reason 
we chose them was for their lack of attachments. So that they &quot;wouldn&#39;t 
be missed,&quot; isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;So, if we let them go, they&#39;d end up homeless and destitute or worse, 
is that what you&#39;re trying to tell me?&quot;

&quot;None of them have any valid qualifications, since none of them legally 
exist.&quot; Midori scraped her fork through the remaining puddle of honey on 
her plate. &quot;Without our help, they&#39;re as good as dead. You want to just 
throw them all away like that, or would you rather do something useful?&quot;

&quot;When you put it like that,&quot; scowled the youngster, &quot;I suppose you have 
a decent argument.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Did you sleep well?&quot;

Natsuki blinked wearily. &quot;Hm?&quot; One hand leaned against the corner of the 
desk and the other rubbed briefly over her eyes while she yawned. &quot;What 
was that?&quot;

&quot;I asked you if you slept soundly, though by the looks of it that would 
be a no.&quot; Shizuru shook her head and sighed exasperatedly. &quot;I never knew 
you were such a worrier to stay up all night like that.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; was the abrupt reply. &quot;I was up all night yesterday too, 
chasing some stupid...&quot; She shook her head. &quot;No, never mind. You&#39;d just 
bug me about it anyway.&quot;

Shizuru pouted at her, or as close to pouting as Shizuru ever came when 
she was in a really serious mood. The dark-haired woman chuckled at her. 
&quot;I don&#39;t need you fretting and asking questions about this, okay? Just 
trust me when I say I know what I&#39;m doing.&quot;

&quot;Not even just a little background? I&#39;d feel much better knowing what it 
is you get up to at night, after all.&quot;

There was a strangely uncomfortable pause while Natsuki settled herself 
into one of the stiff plastic chairs arrayed along the corridor wall, 
still blinking and yawning erratically. Shizuru felt obliged to join 
her, and slid as gracefully as always into place, folding one leg over 
the other in her usual nonchalant manner. The thick binder of documents 
in her hands was a considerable weight in her lap, so she took out the 
first loose piece she could grasp and started skimming idly through it 
while her companion was apparently busy waking up.

&quot;I got a phone call last night,&quot; Natsuki relented, at last. The only 
reply was a mildly intrigued &#39;hm?&#39; She took another deep breath, which 
somehow twisted into a yawn, and then backtracked. &quot;After you called, 
remember, about those two girls?&quot;

&quot;Ah, yes.&quot; Shizuru straightened and lifted her head, gazing off into the 
distance as she thought to herself. &quot;Our young &quot;escapees,&quot; yes, I 
remember. I called you just after midnight if I recall correctly.&quot;

&quot;Well just after that, somebody else called me. To be honest, I&#39;m a 
little worried that he has my number, but I suppose I should have 
expected it.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s this,&quot; Shizuru teased. &quot;You have a stalker now?&quot;

&quot;Stop being silly, this is serious.&quot; Natsuki gave the brunette a 
disgruntled look, which put her firmly back in place for the time being 
at least. &quot;Anyway, besides my new friend, there&#39;s something important I 
think you&#39;ll want to see.&quot; She took out a small oblong-shaped device 
that fit nicely in the palm of her hand and showed it to Shizuru with a 
rather hesitant expression.

&quot;What?&quot; Shizuru frowned. &quot;There&#39;s something wrong, isn&#39;t there.&quot;

&quot;Just...check the disk,&quot; muttered Natsuki, turning away again briskly to 
stare off into the distance.

Shizuru gave her a curious look, but when it became obvious that the 
other woman simply would not comment, she sighed and dipped a hand back 
into her bag. Out came the familiar grey square, about the size of a 
paperback novel, which flicked open smoothly to show a blanked-out 
screen and keypad built into a narrow frame. The egg-shaped device 
slotted neatly into an opening on the side and at once, up came a small 
video feed.

It only took a second or two for Shizuru&#39;s face to turn sour.

&quot;Oh,&quot; she muttered. &quot;I see what you mean...&quot;

The video was of incredibly poor quality, almost to the point that its 
credibility was questionable, but a room could easily be made out. The 
layout, Shizuru recognised immediately, was that of an operating theatre 
of some kind, complete with a fully laden bed in the centre. Upon which 
bed lay a person, female quite clearly and not that old, and seemingly 
unconscious, her eyes closed and most of her lower face covered by 
breathing apparatus. Thick, short crimson hair shrouded one eye and fell 
about her head in a mess on the table. Several masked, white-robed 
persons, presumably doctors or the like, were gathered around the table 
performing various duties with assorted surgical instruments, including 
a decent few that Shizuru couldn&#39;t recognise even at a push.

Thankfully there was no sound, but Shizuru was still pressed to suppress 
a grimace when the unconscious girl&#39;s left arm was totally removed from 
the elbow down, revealing, of all things, what looked like a mechanical 
joint previously concealed by living flesh. Blood poured out as 
copiously as was typical, promptly sucked away into the table by methods 
unseen, leaving no doubt as to the girl&#39;s biological nature.

&quot;Where did you get this,&quot; Shizuru queried her rather perturbed looking 
companion, who was paying close attention to the floor tiles and trying 
not to look affected by the rather distressing images on the screen. &quot;I 
won&#39;t even bother joking with you; I know you&#39;re certainly not that 
twisted.&quot;

&quot;It was anonymous,&quot; replied Natsuki in a voice much steadier than she 
felt, though she hid it admirably. &quot;Whoever sent it, they&#39;d obviously 
rather we not know, for now at least.&quot; When the disk was hesitantly 
offered back she simply turned away from the outstretched hand and 
leaned over slightly in her seat. &quot;You can keep it. I don&#39;t need it 
anyway.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll give it to Motoko. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll know what to do with it.&quot; 
Shizuru paused as she slipped the device, along with her PDA back into 
her bag, looking concernedly at her partner. &quot;There&#39;s something else 
bothering you, though...&quot;

&quot;I think....I recognise her.&quot;

Shizuru blinked. &quot;You mean the girl on the video, don&#39;t you?&quot; A nod was 
the only reply she got. &quot;Do you know who she is?&quot;

&quot;No...just that she&#39;s familiar. I feel like I know her...or like I used 
to know her, I don&#39;t know.&quot; Natsuki shook her head and rose briskly to 
her feet. &quot;What bothers me is whoever sent that did it for a reason and 
I want to know what that reason is.&quot;

&quot;I promise I&#39;ll let you know everything I find. If there&#39;s anything 
suspicious at all, you&#39;ll be the first to hear it.&quot;

&quot;Then I suppose I should get back to my forte, too. I should go check up 
on a few &quot;friends&quot; of mine.&quot;

&quot;Oh, and Natsuki?&quot; She flashed a reassuring smile when the dark-haired 
woman looked back over one shoulder at her. &quot;Please, tell me you won&#39;t 
be doing anything too hasty?&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Shadows are silent. They move in ways that nobody notices, go places 
that no one ever sees. Shadows blend into their surroundings perfectly, 
whatever the setting, day or night. A shadow is as natural and 
inconspicuous as only a shadow can be. They never arouse even the 
vaguest of suspicions.

The shadow moved.

In the semi-gloom inside a badly lit room, neither of the two men 
noticed. They kept their faces to one another instead, speaking in 
hushed tones and gesturing with their hands. The taller of the two had 
cunningly positioned himself so the darkness obscured most of his face, 
and all that could be made out were hard, narrow lips and a faint scar 
running down the left side of his sharp, angular lower jaw. He spoke in 
a very soft voice that barely moved his lips, making eavesdropping on 
the conversation almost impossible. His confidant, shorter by several 
centimetres at least and rather younger, judging by his build alone, was 
easily visible in the sharp artificial light; his dark hair and eyes 
were indiscriminately Japanese, as were his facial features.

Again the shadow moved, slipping through the room like water.

&quot;...-out...&quot;

Inching closer, right to the very edge of the enshrouding blackness, the 
very slightest impression of a feminine figure could be seen beneath the 
shadow.

&quot;I know you&#39;re nervous, sir, and honestly... ...all making this much 
more complicated... ...told you...break out...&quot;

The taller man held up a hand, and the shorter stopped abruptly. He 
shifted his weight nervously from one foot to the other as his apparent 
superior reached up to run a finger against the edge of his chin.

&quot;...warned... ...&quot; Anything else he said was beyond recognition.

&quot;They won&#39;t like this,&quot; replied the Japanese man in an anxious voice. 
&quot;The system still isn&#39;t ready, we need more time to set it up.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

Whatever the tall man said, his partner looked more than a little 
shocked, almost frightened by it. He quickly regained his composure with 
a shake of his head. &quot;I&#39;ll see what I can do,&quot; he sighed, looking down. 
&quot;Let Beuman know we might need aerial support, his ship has that new 
Sukhoi squadron, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;...told you... ...that...&quot;

&quot;Mister Fa-&quot; The Japanese man hesitated, clearly unnerved. &quot;Captain, we 
really need those double-As in position by the end of the day. I can 
only trust you&#39;ll do your best to make it happen.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sir,&quot; replied the tall man, and turned to leave.

With the barest whisper of cloth on the metal floor, the shadow was 
gone.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As per ordinary routine, the 12th District Tokyo hospital was relatively 
quiet over the lunch hour, the office section at least. Down in the 
lobby and around the various wards rushed nurses to and fro, patients 
shuttling between rooms and departments, doctors with far too little 
time to spare. The noise was almost unbearable, and it wasn&#39;t even a 
particularly busy day. Sunlight streamed in through the lobby windows 
and blinded everyone inside, slow-cooking most of the patients waiting 
in those ugly little blue plastic chairs lined up across the polished 
floor.

Shizuru winced, but hid it well, when the sun hit her face as she 
stepped out into the lobby. Her secretary, not moments behind her, 
showed no reaction at all, not that she actually had any. The sun in the 
blonde woman&#39;s eyes had about as much of an adverse effect on her as did 
an angry patient yelling in her face. For not the first time, Shizuru 
thought herself lucky to have someone so...unique under her wing, 
figuratively speaking.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Motoko spoke just as flatly as usual.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Shizuru tried to sound cheerful, however difficult it was having 
seen all that paperwork on her desk waiting for her when she returned.

&quot;Your date, ma&#39;am,&quot; explained the blonde. &quot;You&#39;re going to be late.&quot; The 
tone of her voice suggested she didn&#39;t care in the slightest, and that 
was probably true.

In a strange moment of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, Shizuru reached into her bag to retrieve 
the keys to her car only to have that familiar buzzing noise catch her 
attention. She shot her secretary an amused little smile, which was not 
returned, and fished her PDA out of its nesting place.

&quot;If it&#39;s not one thing,&quot; she sighed exasperatedly.

&quot;It&#39;s you,&quot; Motoko finished for her cynically.

&quot;Moko-chan, be a dear and go pout somewhere else. My real girlfriend 
wants my attention.&quot; Shizuru waved the younger woman off with one hand 
as her other nimbly worked the keypad on the small electrical device in 
her palm. She spared only the briefest glance after the blonde as she 
walked away, just for the sake of seeing the way the back of Motoko&#39;s 
miniskirt curved around the contours of her thighs when she moved. A 
smirk came to her lips at the sight. &quot;Good thing I got such an adorable 
assistant, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Then the PDA demanded her attention again. She checked carefully and, 
there under &quot;INCOMING&quot; was a single file marked &quot;urgent&quot; from Natsuki&#39;s 
mobile number. She opened it up and, lo and behold, it was just as 
curious if not more so than she had expected.

First of all, there was what appeared to be a list of numbers all 
roughly twelve digits, there must have been at least a hundred or more, 
alongside a corresponding column of alphanumeric characters arranged in 
a way Shizuru didn&#39;t quite recognise.

Secondly, and more importantly, was what looked like scans taken from an 
identification document of some sort. Right there on the first page, 
blaring out at her, was a picture of a very familiar orange-haired, 
purple-eyed young girl in her late teens, smiling at the camera. 
Alongside were written a few rather troubling things.

Name: Tokiha Mai.

Age: 16.

Last known residence: unconfirmed. (Yokohama area)

Relations: Mother (name unknown) DECEASED. Father (name unknown) 
DECEASED. Brother (Tokiha Takumi)...

Shizuru blinked.

DECEASED.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Shizuru murmured to herself. &quot;That&#39;s a little worrying, isn&#39;t it 
then?&quot;

She skimmed quickly through the rest of the document: everything from a 
physical analysis, blood tests, drug results and the like. The details 
were unnerving, more so in the fact that the document appeared for all 
intents and purposes, totally authentic. By the end, Shizuru was more 
than just a little bit worried.

And then she checked the line she had skipped right on the very first 
page...

Time of death: 17:06:52.

She looked again.

Time of death.

She shook her head. Impossible. Tokiha Mai was clearly very much alive 
and well, if unconscious, in a room in that very hospital at that exact 
moment, probably having some very relaxing dream or other. She was 
certainly not dead. The blindingly obvious suddenly occurred to Shizuru, 
and she checked the document header.

&quot;National Registry: Department of Records&quot; was printed plain as day at 
the top of each page. At the bottom of the last page as expected was a 
signature, presumably from whoever had been on duty at the time. This 
was most inscrutably a certificate of the deceased, and that meant that 
Tokiha Mai was legally dead.

Tokiha Mai...was legally dead?

Shizuru put a hand to her forehead and sighed, as seemed to have become 
a habit lately. &quot;This is just getting ridiculous,&quot; she muttered to no 
one in particular. &quot;No wonder the management stuck her with 
Miko...to...&quot;

Something clicked. It suddenly made sense. Shizuru suddenly knew that 
she didn&#39;t need to see a similar document to know that Mikoto had been 
long since declared dead in much the same way, not that that would stop 
her checking anyway just to be sure. That answered plenty of interesting 
questions and opened up a whole plethora of new ones.

Natsuki would doubtless have a lot of explaining to do later that 
afternoon.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a cool, quiet afternoon in that secluded little hotel room. The 
hum from the air conditioning unit built into the ceiling was just 
barely audible, and over that came the sound of a few over-excited 
birds, the regular traffic along the road outside, and the ever-present 
drone of cicadas everywhere they could find to land. The balcony doors 
were open once again, letting in a gentle sea breeze that filled the air 
with the faint scent of salt and fish. Fortunately, the sun was on the 
other side of the building, so no blinding light came in through the 
open curtains. The lights were off, and the whole room took on a much 
more relaxed, lethargic sort of atmosphere.

The sheet on the bed was soaked by now, but it didn&#39;t matter. On 
reflection, the air conditioning hadn&#39;t really done as good of a job as 
they had expected, and now both the room&#39;s occupants were collapsed, 
naked and sweating quite profusely, on the bed, the covers left in a 
heap on the floor.

&quot;I told you cooking breakfast would be too much for you,&quot; mumbled Nina 
through the back of her hand. &quot;But you just wouldn&#39;t listen, would you?&quot;

Arika rolled over onto her stomach, wincing at the feeling of 
sweat-soaked cloth against her belly. &quot;Well I had to do something,&quot; she 
argued weakly, &quot;or I would&#39;ve gone crazy in here, do nothing all day.&quot; 
She sighed as heavily as she could. &quot;It&#39;s just so boring sitting her, 
waiting for nothing.&quot;

&quot;Then go outside, you exhibitionist.&quot; One of her legs landed across 
Nina&#39;s stomach and was promptly shoved off, to a fairly pathetic attempt 
at a yelp from its owner. &quot;And stop bothering me so much with how bored 
you are, hm?&quot;

&quot;Ni-ni-chan,&quot; moaned the redhead. &quot;You&#39;re so mean sometimes. I almost 
regret saving your life back then...&quot;

Nina bashed her lightly on the head with one fist. &quot;Well then who would 
you have to annoy, Arinko? Besides, nobody else can put up with your 
whining voice for as long as I can.&quot;

&quot;Ers-chan said I have a nice voice,&quot; protested Arika, sitting upright 
with a disgruntled pout on her face.

&quot;That&#39;s because you usually whined at me!&quot; Nina gave her a good whack in 
the face with a pillow, and that sent her toppling onto her back with a 
yelp, arms flailing. &quot;I was the one getting all those irritating 
complaints about absolutely everything. Every ten minutes, you&#39;d start 
moaning about something else.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not true,&quot; argued Arika, reaching for a pillow of her own and 
striking back with a clean uppercut to the jaw. &quot;It just seems that way 
because you were so mean to me all the time! You never stopped...&quot; She 
cut off when Nina whacked her square in the face again, with exactly the 
same result as the first time.

&quot;You&#39;re so predictable, Arinko. I knew you&#39;d blame it on me. But who was 
it who filled the pool with sugar?&quot;

&quot;That wasn&#39;t my fault!&quot; Arika protested loudly when the other girl moved 
to straddle her thighs, holding her down as the pillow &quot;whapped&quot; down 
over her face repeatedly. &quot;I...didn&#39;t...know the...labels 
were...switched,&quot; she protested between hits. &quot;And it...wasn&#39;t...me 
who...put those things...in the pool...in the...first place.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah? Well, ack...&quot; Nina squealed and windmilled her arms as a leg 
tangled into her thigh and pulled her down onto her back again.

&quot;Gotcha!&quot; There was a brief flurry of stuffing as the slightly battered 
and torn pillows were discarded and Arika dove on her opponent, fingers 
outstretched.

&quot;No,&quot; yelped Nina, visibly panicked. &quot;No! Anything, anything but that!&quot;

Arika wasn&#39;t having any of that. Her fingers knew exactly what they were 
doing. She held the dark-haired girl pinned to the bed in much the same 
way as she had been restrained herself and worked her hands rapidly up 
and down Nina&#39;s sides and stomach, fingertips dancing over slick skin. 
Nina was emitting the most satisfying noise somewhere between squeals of 
torment and uncontrollable laughter, along with those sexy little 
squeaks she always made that only encouraged her attacker on even more.

A decidedly evil cackle came to Arika&#39;s lips without her even thinking 
of it. For a moment or two, she almost looked menacing, towering over 
her fallen opponent and torturing mercilessly at the other young girl&#39;s 
weak spot.

All of a sudden, Arika collapsed atop her target with a sigh. Nina 
protested quite loudly for a while, kicking her legs and batting at the 
redhead&#39;s shoulders, but both girls were really too drained to do much 
more. Eventually, they just lay there like they had before, half-awake 
and breathing heavily.

&quot;It&#39;s too hot.&quot;

Arika sat up again, pigtails bouncing about wildly. &quot;Then we&#39;ll go out 
and do something fun!&quot;

&quot;Stupid. It&#39;s even hotter out there than it is here.&quot;

Arika pouted. &quot;You&#39;re boring, Nina-chan. Come on, it&#39;ll be fun at 
least.&quot; She reached and grabbed the other girl&#39;s wrist firmly in hand 
and pulled her up to her feet. &quot;We can go see what this place is like! 
We can meet a few of the locals or whatever, get to know people, have 
something to eat.&quot;

Nina opened her mouth to protest but her stomach interrupted.

&quot;See?&quot; Arika poked her in the ribs, ignoring the blush and the protests 
that went along with it. &quot;Your stomach agrees with me! We should go and 
spend a little of that money Miyu gave us.&quot;

&quot;Some clothes might be nice,&quot; argued Nina not too subtly. &quot;How are we 
going to go walking around in public naked, in the middle of the day?&quot;

Arika waved her free hand dismissively, smiling in a way that wasn&#39;t at 
all comforting. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Nina-chan, I&#39;ll think of something. Come 
on, let&#39;s go already!&quot; With that, she half-dragged her companion out the 
door into a fortunately abandoned corridor, pausing only to let Nina 
lock the door behind them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mai felt oxygen flooding her lungs, her chest expanding, her blood 
tingling in her veins. Muscles twitched all over her body, from the ends 
of her toes to the tips of her fingers, to the back of her neck and even 
the base of her spine. All ten digits curled up and stretched out at 
once, and then her hands balled up into loose fists. Her eyelids peeled 
back ever so slowly and she squinted against the sudden light flooding 
her optic nerves.

&quot;Nuh,&quot; she uttered incoherently at first, feeling every tiny flex and 
twitch of all the muscles in her tongue, the way her vocal chords 
tightened in her throat. Her hands shifted up beside her and she put all 
her upper body weight onto her elbows, slowly pushing herself to sit 
upright. It was almost dizzying for a few moments until she gently shook 
her head to banish the sensation altogether, which unfortunately made 
her head spin and her stomach lurch.

&quot;Mai!&quot; an excited voice squealed just to her left. Then before she knew 
it, a familiar lump was leaning in against her side, arms around her 
middle. She looked down at that vague form and couldn&#39;t stop a quietly 
relieved smile from growing over her face.

&quot;Mikoto...I&#39;m okay.&quot; She put one hand atop the young girl&#39;s head and 
played her fingers through that short-cropped black hair. &quot;I&#39;m okay, 
don&#39;t worry.&quot;

Mikoto nodded emphatically, face still buried into the taller woman&#39;s 
chest, and made a soft affirmative sound. Mai chuckled a little 
self-consciously.

&quot;Good morning, Tokiha-san,&quot; uttered a most elegant sounding female voice 
from somewhere off to her left. She looked up again as it continued, 
searching for its owner. &quot;It&#39;s good to see that you&#39;re awake finally. 
Welcome to the Twelfth District hospital... again.&quot;

&quot;Ah!&quot; Mai felt a grin coming on as the smartly-dressed older woman in 
the dark brown suit came into focus at last, long chestnut hair shinier 
than ever with the late evening sunlight streaming in through the window 
opposite her. &quot;Fujino-san... Thank you. It&#39;s nice to be back.&quot; She 
looked around slowly at the bland hospital room in which she suddenly 
found herself, and confusion bloomed on her features. &quot;But how in the 
world did I get here in the first place?&quot;

Shizuru gestured broadly with one hand towards the bed, smiling a most 
amused sort of smile. &quot;Kuga-san very kindly brought you here after you 
apparently collapsed. She was very worried about you, actually.&quot; Mai 
turned her head quickly to look to her right instead and, sure enough, 
there she was standing in the gap between the bed and the near wall, 
just to the right of that wide panel window, the sunlight gleaming off 
one edge of her navy blue hair and obscuring most of her face in deep 
shadow.

&quot;Natsuki...&quot; Mai felt her hand slipping from the small head nuzzled 
against her chest and instead was reaching tentatively out towards the 
dark-haired woman standing beside her. &quot;I don&#39;t know how you found 
me...or how you got me here, but I&#39;m glad. I owe you a lot now.&quot;

Natsuki turned her head slightly to one side and for a moment...

&quot;Mikoto was so worried about you, too. I&#39;m afraid neither one of them 
has gotten much sleep all night.&quot; Shizuru smiled a little more politely 
this time, and then bowed. &quot;As long as you&#39;re okay though, I&#39;d best be 
getting back to work. Please excuse me.&quot; With that, she was out the door 
and gone surprisingly quickly.

An awkward silence descended, but nobody seemed to notice it. Mai was 
too busy returning the impromptu hugging, Mikoto was too busy enjoying 
just such activity and Natsuki was absorbed in her own little mental 
goings-on as she stared at the now closed door. It was Mikoto who 
eventually broke the silence; without any real sort of warning, she 
slumped down with her head in the redheaded woman&#39;s lap and started 
snoring softly, only her semi-limp legs keeping her from dropping to the 
floor. Mai giggled after a confused few moments and started stroking 
affectionately at the young girl&#39;s hair again.

&quot;She must be exhausted,&quot; she said fondly. &quot;Did she stay up all night to 
be here?&quot;

&quot;She wouldn&#39;t cooperate when I tried to make her go to sleep. She&#39;s 
almost as stubborn as you.&quot; Before she had time to turn her head round 
again, Mai felt a hand on her shoulder from behind. &quot;What about you? Are 
you sure you&#39;re okay?&quot;

There was another long, slightly uncomfortable pause. Mai resisted the 
urge to turn and look, why she didn&#39;t quite know.

&quot;Natsuki,&quot; she finally asked, very gently indeed.

&quot;Hm?&quot; She paused for quite a while before the right words came to mind.

&quot;Why are you crying?&quot;

Natsuki hesitated just a little too long before answering. &quot;That&#39;s 
silly,&quot; she replied dismissively, turning to face across the window so 
that her face was obscured by the time Mai turned towards her. &quot;Why 
would I be crying? You&#39;re okay, after all, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

Again, for just the briefest second, Mai thought she saw...something. 
But it was gone when she blinked.

She opened her mouth to apologize, for what exactly, she wasn&#39;t really 
sure, but the other woman cut her off again. &quot;You should go back to 
sleep, Tokiha. You need rest after collapsing like that.&quot; Natsuki took a 
long, deep yawn and arched her back out in a way that looked almost 
painful. &quot;Kami knows, I need it, after carrying you down all those...&quot; 
she trailed off.

Mai smiled somewhat playfully. &quot;You carried me all the way down that 
building. How sweet of you.&quot; Then she blinked again. &quot;But...it&#39;s not 
just that, is it?&quot; She looked up and down the figure beside her once 
more, her first real look since she had blacked out the previous night, 
and she definitely noticed that odd something. &quot;You weren&#39;t 
riding...were you? You didn&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t what?&quot; came the answer in a slightly sharper tone of voice.

&quot;You did, didn&#39;t you? You carried me all the way here...&quot;

&quot;Not like it was that tough or anything. I can bench-press my own bike 
after all, shit, we both can. Remember?&quot;

Mai giggled, which brought much confusion. &quot;For a white knight, you&#39;re a 
little shy.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re crazy,&quot; replied Natsuki, blushing quite beautifully. Mai 
knew the dark-haired woman thought she hadn&#39;t noticed, what with the 
lighting and all, and she said nothing, but she was certainly enjoying 
herself on the inside. &quot;Now just go back to sleep, would you?&quot;

&quot;Awww...I love you too,&quot; teased the redhead, but she did finally roll
