<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Speak  the truth or make your peace on my way / I never knew / but I believe  that your trust in me will speak to me</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Speak</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Like I  said before, my mind tends to gloss over little details that should  be very important to me: The smell of fish cooking to inform me that  I’m about to be treated to a meal; the chill in an autumn wind  telling me that winter is coming; the side of a tree that moss grows  on, pointing me to where I should be going.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sometimes  my mind makes unforgivable mistakes, too.  Things that I can never  excuse it for.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My mind  made one of those mistakes that day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As well  as I knew it at a level below my own, as often as I’d had a chance  to experience this particular sensation, my mind, as it always did,  failed to inform me how good Aoi’s hand really felt in my own.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
There  was nobody waiting for us at the fountain when we got there.  It was,  in fact, completely deserted except for Mai, who was simply passing  behind it. It was on the way to her dorm, after all.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oi!”  I called, waving at her.  “Mai!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  stopped, blinked, recognized me, scampered towards us.  I say  “scampered” because it’s really the only way to describe Mai  when she’s utterly at peace, content with herself and the world;  she’s really as much of a cat as that girl of hers Mikoto is; she  just hides it better.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How’re  you doing?” Mai said, flashing that man-killing smile of hers at  us.  The worst of it is that she’s got no real clue the kind of  affect her smile has on other people, namely on other men.  And me,  as we’ve established already by the fact that I was, indeed,  sweating and holding hands with Aoi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I opened  my mouth to say something, but Aoi cut me off.  “We’re quite  well,” she said with a big grin—her smile was easily as deadly as  Mai’s, but only when it was more than a humored grin, which it most  definitely was at this moment—“but listen, we’ve got kind of a  problem.  Have you seen anybody around here in the past five minutes  or so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Has  she been waiting around here for five minutes? </em>I wondered  briefly.  A few seconds later, I decided that she had probably been  within view of the fountain for five minutes, and a second after  that, my bullshit detector started blaring at me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe I  was just overthinking it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  haven’t seen anybody,” Mai said with a frown.  “But I <em>did </em>see something stuck to the other side of the fountain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  frowned and said, “What kind of thing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  idea,” Mai shrugged. “It looked like a piece of paper. Here, one  second, I’ll go and get it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  started to protest, but before I could, she had gone to retrieve  whatever it was, and I felt a little bit of dread creep in amidst my  annoyance.  Not only had the bastard made Aoi</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>look  at me like that</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">sad,  but he had either stood us up, or…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or what  I was dreading would come true, and this was going to turn into some  goddamn pseudo-romantic wild duck hunt.  I say “hunt” because I  was going to shoot him as soon as I had a clear shot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai came  back holding something with pink frills and a crease roughly down the  center, and I began to wish that I’d asked my mother for a shotgun  for my birthday instead of a new camera.  Mai started to open it, and  my eyes bugged out. The next second, moving with a speed I never knew  I possessed and a dexterity I certainly didn’t, I knocked it out of  her hands; I had intended to snatch it from her grasp, but my fingers  weren’t that nimble.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Glancing  back at Aoi, I saw a flash of that look on her face again, and it  only imbued my resolve; I considered different ways to use my limited  abilities in the fields of math, science, and a little thing called  “aim” to construct and employ a crude bow-and-arrow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instead,  I picked the card up and read it, first to myself to make sure it  wasn’t horrifically embarrassing, and then aloud. Once again, the  card was a little corny.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please,”  I said quietly, not wanting to broadcast somebody’s message of  undying love (though certainly not mine) to everybody else, mostly  for their sake, “forgive this misdirection of the flesh.  I swear  to you I have not deceived your heart, and I will show you if you  will meet me in the forest at the base of the mountain trail.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When I  looked up, Mai was smirking at me, and Aoi was cleverly studying the  cement under her feet. Put two and two together, and you got me  ripping the cement out from under Aoi so she’d stop staring at it  so intently, and using it to pound the smart-ass out of Mai.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’d  never do that, of course. I’m a devoted pacifist, honest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  guess you’d better head out then, shouldn’t you?” Mai said, her  smartassed grin still begging for contact with pavement.  “You  wouldn’t want him to think that you thought your heart had been  misdirected too, would you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fuck  you,” I muttered, crumpling the paper up and throwing it in the  fountain.  “I’m going to do something to his heart, but it’s  not going to have anything to do with misdirection.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I swear  I’m not usually this violent.  At the time, I had no idea what was  eating at me so hard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It had  something to do, I think, with the way Aoi said, her voice a little  weak, as though she was struggling to say what she wanted to say,  “can I still come with you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  though she thought that maybe I would say no.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instead,  I grabbed her hand and smiled at her, forcing her to look up at me,  to meet my gaze, which I hoped was reassuring and fierce all at once.  “Of course you can,” I said. “How can I be lesbian <em>flambé </em>all by myself? We’re going to get this guy, Aoi. Promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai said  from behind me, cleverly out of my peripheral vision so I couldn’t  bean her with something, “Chie is scary when people ask her out  without her permission.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Also  from behind me, somebody else said, “Mai, what’s ‘lesbian’?  Is it a kind of food?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  snorted, and I realized that ‘somebody else’ was Mikoto, the only  person who could possibly say something so true while remaining so  unbearably innocent.  She had probably come up behind Mai when I was  in the middle of premeditating murder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I turned  around to find, as expected, a curious-faced Mikoto, hanging off of  Mai’s arm.  Mai looked at her with the same resigned look of  affection that I had always seen in Aoi’s mildly conservative, yet  ultimately accepting parents.  I had never really known what it  meant; she had never been the clingy type around them, and the few  times I had had dinner at her house, I had always sensed a dull  tension between them: Not the kind of tension you get when you’re  about to explode, but the kind of tension you might get with your  lover a day after a fight. I guess it was something nearer to an  excess of delicacy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  wondered briefly why there was an excess of delicacy between Mikoto  and Mai, and then dismissed it.  She’d tell me eventually if she  was going to tell me.  I hoped that she was going to tell me.  In  hindsight, I knew exactly why it was, and really, it only took me a  few moments to catch on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I wanted  to make sure she did tell me, though, and for the first time in a  long time I felt a pang of guilt at something I’d done.  To Mai, no  less; not my closest friend, but far from my most distant; I trusted  her, and she trusted me, and the thought that I’d lose her trust  was suddenly eating at me a lot more than it probably should have  been considering I hadn’t done anything horrible to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or maybe  I had.  She was a shy girl.  She didn’t like those things getting  spread all over the school.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe  Aoi saw it in my face like a psychic, or maybe she was just more  cunning than I gave her credit for, because a second later, she said,  “I’m just going to go wait ahead for you, okay? I’ll wait by  the edge of the forest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I nodded  to her, and a moment later, she left, ushering Mikoto off with her,  losing all pretense at that point.  Now it was just me and Mai,  facing each other</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>excess  of delicacy</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">not  entirely comfortably. The moment of silence that followed threatened  to open its yaw and stretch itself into infinity; she just looked at  me, her gaze not entirely happy, and I found myself looking away,  unable to speak for that moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>excess</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fuck that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mai,”  I said, my tone louder than that of the average apology, “I’m  really sorry about telling Mikoto about your thing with Tate.  I…” <em>didn’t know she was going to write it on about fifteen different  blackboards around the school for fun. She’s not usually like that;  it’s almost like she was </em>trying <em>to fuck with your mind but I  didn’t want that honestly I didn’t I hated that look on your face  when you walked in and saw it and saw her and people were laughing  and Mikoto didn’t look confused like she usually does she looked  like she </em>“wasn’t thinking.  I honestly don’t know what I  was thinking, but—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  rarely cuts people off mid-sentence, even if she wants to scream at  them, so when she does, you shut up and pay attention.  “Why would  you tell that to<em> anybody, </em>much less Mikoto, Chie?” I shut up  and paid attention, because even if her tone was quiet, her voice was  hard.  “Even before this, she’d been clinging onto me literally <em>all the time.</em>”  She looked like she kind of wanted to stop,  but wanted more to continue, and I didn’t stop her; the fact that I  hadn’t heard Mai complain about <em>anything </em>more than about  three times in my life held me in rapt attention, and it certainly  didn’t hurt that healthy guilt complex that my subconscious was  busily constructing. “And…and she actually <em>pouts </em>when I go  to spend time with Yuuichi.  I’ve never seen her act like this  before, and…”  “She’s acting like…like Yuuichi did.  Before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I knew  what she meant.  She was acting like Yuuichi had when he had thought  Mai had agreed to cheer that clingy little kid Shiho on.  Hurt,  betrayed, and as immature as he could manage.  It sounded to me like  Mikoto was just acting like a jealous ex-girlfriend, and,  unfortunately, this didn’t surprise me.  In reality, I had expected  this for a long time; Mikoto had been musing forever about how Mai  was hers and how Yuuichi and Reito should give up on her, and it was  only a matter of time before she started becoming bitter at the  prospect of these musings never turning into something more.  I  honestly think she was in love with Mai, but she probably had  absolutely no idea what to do with that love.  Mikoto was immature,  at best, though not generally childish, and after a while, all first  loves turn into bitterness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then  they’re over with, and it’s like it never happened.   But what do  you do when you live with your first love?  Does it just vanish like  that?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fucked  if I know. My first love was my second grade teacher; he was really  creepy, in retrospect, but he treated me well, and paid attention to  me, told me I was a good kid.  That only made it creepier, but at the  time, I was convinced I would be married to him as soon as I came of  age and graduated from second grade.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  sighed. “I’m sorry, Mai.  Really, I am; what’s going on is  probably going to be hard on both you<em> and </em>Mikoto.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know that,” Mai said quietly, her voice more bitter than I was used  to from her. “I already know all of that, but even so,” she shook  her head, “I wish there was something I could do about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  understood too.  Mai was sharp; there wasn’t a soul on earth that  could deny that.  I went to her then, and put my arms around her,  squeezing as tight as I could, whispering to her that I was sorry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After a  few seconds, she returned my hug, buried her head in my neck; a  moment later, I felt something hot and moist drip down my shirt; her  tears mingled with the sweat on my breasts, and while I’m sure  somebody would have found it attractive, there was simply no way to  make it anything but sorrowful at that moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe a  minute later, she broke the hug, looked me in the eye.  “You’re  lucky,” she said.  “Your other best friend isn’t a kid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  laughed at this.  I laughed because I didn’t want to admit that  what Mai said was practically news to me; I still saw Aoi as a sort  of student at that point. Even teachers barely older than those they  teach see all students as children. I laughed because she was right.  “Forgive me?”  She nodded, and I grinned at her and said, my tone  lighter, “Good. Then I’m allowed to tell you not to think of  Mikoto as a kid for too much longer. She’s not; she’s just had no  role model to base romance in her life on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  what about Aoi?” Mai asked.  This confused me and hit me in the  stomach pretty hard, all at once, and I had no idea why.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  about her?” I answered, lacking anything wittier to say.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  chuckled and shook her head.  “Nothing.  You should probably catch  up to her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I stared  at her for a minute, trying to decide what she meant by that. Maybe  she didn’t mean anything. Maybe I was just turning paranoid.  This  letter thing had put me pretty on-edge pretty quick; I wasn’t  normally this high-strung.  Was something happening to me?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I put it  out of my head.  I was probably just pissed because of how Aoi had  looked</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>eyes  downcast fingers wringing together </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">hurt.  I  was very protective of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright,”  I said without thinking about it, in lieu of a better excuse to  leave. “I’ll do that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai had  this funny look on her face when I left. I didn’t understand it for  a long time; at that moment I gave it barely a pause to consider as I  took off for the edge of the forest, at the base of a little path  that, if followed long enough, led to the top of the mountain that  bathed our school in shadow every sunset.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  wasn’t a long jog; five minutes, tops, and it didn’t particularly  affect me.  Maybe that was from the mile run; my blood was already  moving, and my adrenaline was really just lying under the grass,  waiting to pounce.  When I got there, however, Aoi was panting; like  though she was being exhausted for me. <em>Oh, don’t you worry  about that exhaustion, ma’am; I’ll just take that for you. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  frowned at her, and she looked at me with as much of a grin as she  could muster through her sheen of hot lesbian sweat.  Sorry, <em>our </em>sheen of hot lesbian sweat.  I grabbed her hand, curious about  why she looked so breathless, and wanting desperately to ask, but  more concerned about what I saw in her eyes:  Anxiety.  She was  nervous about something, as, I realized, she had been all night.  I  wondered what it was, but for the first time in as long as I could  remember, I cared more about making it go away than about finding out  what was up; I was a knowledge hog, but I was also Aoi’s friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So I  grabbed her hand and pulled her along as I took off into a jog up the  small incline.  “Come on,” I said.  “We’re going hunting; no  time to be exhausted now, sweetheart.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked fairly startled by my sudden burst of energy. I guess I was  too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But we  went together anyway.  It felt good.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
That  forest remains one of my favorite places on this earth, even now,  many years after this happened.  Not simply for the memories I have  of it, but for the way it looked.  The way it smelled.  The earth  here alternated between brown and green, between soft and crunchy;  the browns were soft, light browns that reminded you less of dirt  clods and more of a fragrant garden; the greens were dark and full,  natural.  There was no order to the whole thing, and yet, I felt that  this was because the forest was order unto itself.  Poetic, right? I  prefer to think anybody with any sort of oratory skills would say the  same thing.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  trees, though.  It was the trees that really got to me; the older  trees were huge and overpowering; in their shadow, the growing,  thinner trees, sheltered from the wind and the storms by what I could  only call their parents.  Their bark was just a shade lighter than  the brown of the earth; their leaves a shade darker than the green of  the grass.  They surrounded you, protecting both you and themselves.  That’s really the best way I can describe it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi and  I didn’t say anything while we walked up the forest path, which led  to a mountain trail after about a ten minute walk.  We didn’t need  to. Her hand was warm, soft, and a little moist in mine, and it felt  damned good.  Even if we were only lesbians for a day, it really did  feel good.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  almost didn’t surprise me when, at the base of the mountain trail,  another note was tacked to the same tree that served as a sign for  students that the trail was about to turn steep.  The tree itself was  really two trees that had grown out of the same trunk, branching  opposite each other, forming a crude <em>V. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The note  read, <em>Please, meet me at the peak of this trail, at the plateau  that overlooks the ocean.  I’ll be waiting there.  No more tricks,  I promise. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Less  mushy than the rest of them; it surprised me.  This time, Aoi didn’t  react when I gently folded the note up and stuck it in my pocket.  I  looked at her seriously, and for the first time today, I asked, “Are  you sure you want to do this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Positive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you okay?” I asked like I didn’t know why I was asking.  Maybe I  didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine,”  she said, her voice firm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  nodded, looked up at the trail.  “Shall we go, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  smiled at me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  she said.  “We shall.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We were  still holding hands.</span></p>
