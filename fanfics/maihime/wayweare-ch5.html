<p>An  Unexpected Gift</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>Thursday, December  13</em>
<p>I was currently on my  way to Shizuru’s dorm for a last minute study session, the chilling  wind whipping against me as I zoomed down the city streets on my  bike. The tight leather of my biker suit helped to shield me some,  but the cruel winter air still bit at my skin, and in turn I pushed  my bike faster despite the fact that I was approaching a sharp curve.  I had a bad habit of doing that…putting myself in unnecessary  dangerous situations. Some might say I lived life on the edge or that  I just didn’t care about what happened to me…I’d say it was a  combination of the two.</p>
<p>Maybe I was just being  overconfident about my own abilities. Ever since that night at the  school when I first discovered my powers, I had felt stronger than I  ever had before in my entire life. On top of that, my body was in the  best shape that it had ever been in as well. I’d even go as far as  to say that I was more trained and toned than a majority of the  athletes at any of the Fuuka Academy schools. Unfortunately this  became known to many of the other students during my P.E. class and  as a result, thanks to the word of mouth, almost all of the sports  clubs had come to me asking for me to join their team. Even some of  the high school teams tried to talk to me. I turned them all down, of  course. I didn’t have the time for any extracurricular activities,  but to be perfectly honest with myself, I think deep down I was truly  curious about actually joining one of them. Who knew, maybe I would  one of these days.</p>
<p>Speaking of the night I  first awakened, since that time I had summoned Duran on one occasion  when I was in danger. I ran into a creature, a monster really, that  tried to attack me one night when I was out snooping around the  Academy. I assume this happened because I was a HiME, but I wasn’t  entirely positive of this theory at the time. When the thing  appeared, I was quick to call upon my child. We fought side by side,  complementing each other in a way I never though possible by two  separate beings. It was amazing…like Duran knew exactly what I was  thinking...The silver wolf and I, we were truly connected.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would call  him when I rode at night, Duran’s lithe metal body following in  perfect stride with my roaring vehicle. No matter how fast I went, he  always kept up. Whenever a car approached, he was quick to disappear.  He was an impressively powerful and intelligent creature. Just having  him around was comforting, especially during those times I felt  exceptionally lonely. Tonight wasn’t one of those nights though.</p>
<p>It was amazing how much  I had opened up to Shizuru…well, it was a lot for <em>me</em> anyway.  It happened gradually, but she just had a way about her. That  comforting nature she possessed...it was exactly what I was missing  in my life. Maybe that’s why I was so drawn to her. Sure she was  annoying sometimes, especially with her constant teasing, but I think  that was just one of her ways of showing that she cared. And it was  nice knowing that someone cared…it was inexpressively nice…but at  the same time it scared me. With these new powers that I possessed, I  was in danger. Because I was in danger that put anyone I was around  in danger. Who knew what these First District people were capable  of…and then there were the monsters that would randomly appear…I  had to be careful for my, and more importantly, Shizuru’s sake.</p>
<p>It had been kind of  late when I called her asking for help, but Shizuru had still agreed  to assist me with my studying. I wouldn’t have done it if it  weren’t necessary. I had a test the next day, and my tests were the  only thing keeping me out of trouble for my slacking attendance  record. The teachers couldn’t complain as long as I was passing  their classes, right?</p>
<p>Quickly shutting off my  bike, I hastily tore my helmet from my head and locked it away in the  storage compartment of my bike before grabbing my math book and  sprinting towards the front entrance of the building. With equal  endeavor I bounded up the small set of stairs leading to the second  floor, and once I had made my way to Shizuru’s room, I quietly  knocked on the door. It didn’t take long before the girl appeared  before me.</p>
<p>“Natsuki, come in.”</p>
<p>I did so immediately,  welcoming the warm air of her room with open arms, “God, it’s  cold out there.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, it hasn’t  been this cold in the past couple of years,” Shizuru replied after  she had promptly shut and locked the door.</p>
<p>She was already adorned  in her pajamas, a pastel violet robe that reminded me more of a  kimono than PJs. Her hair was slightly messy, and I noticed that her  bed wasn’t exactly made.</p>
<p><em>I hope I didn’t  wake her up…</em></p>
<p>“Would you like some  tea to warm you up?”</p>
<p>“That’d be great.  I’m going to change out of this suit before I do anything though.”</p>
<p>I watched as Shizuru  walked over to the kitchen and began busying herself with making the  tea before placing my book on the table and heading over to her  closet. Ever since I had bought my motorcycle, I was sure to keep a  few changes of extra clothing at her place. Peeling the leather suit  from my body, I was clad in only my undergarments for a few moments  before slipping into a pair of sleek navy pajama bottoms and a mock  jersey t-shirt with blue and white striped sleeves and a number eight  plastered on the back.</p>
<p>Now that I was in  something more comfortable, I made my way back over to the table, and  after sitting down, I reluctantly opened my algebra book. I began  reading, but eventually I averted my eyes to Shizuru whose back still  faced me as she prepared our drinks.</p>
<p>“Sorry for calling so  late…It was kind of an emergency.”</p>
<p>“Ara, don’t  apologize, Natsuki. I’m here to help you whenever you need me,”  she turned to look at me, leaning back against the counter after she  did so, “Don’t ever hesitate to call...for anything.”</p>
<p>Her words caused a  genuine smile to appear on my face, “Thanks, Shizuru. I really do  appreciate it.”</p>
<p>Looking back down at my  book, my expression changed to one of complete annoyance, “Now if I  can only comprehend these damn trigonometric equations…”</p>
<p>I heard Shizuru quietly  chuckle at my frustration as she walked over towards the table,  leaning over me to look at my book.</p>
<p>“Hmm…It doesn’t  look too bad.”</p>
<p>“Easy for you to say,  you’ve already taken this stuff.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure we can  figure it out,” she reassured me with a light pat on the head as  she made her way back over to the kitchen to take care of the  whistling kettle. I huffed at her little show of affection as I  stared at my book again.</p>
<p>As I stared to write  down the first equation, she returned to the table with two mugs of  hot tea. Setting them down in front of me, she circled the table to  come take a seat beside me.</p>
<p>“So, where do we  begin?”</p>
<p>An hour and two cups of  tea later we had gone through all of the questions on the page. They  ranged from easy to hard, but with Shizuru’s patience and  assistance, I worked through all of them.</p>
<p>“Huh, that wasn’t  so hard after all.” I stated, putting down my pencil after  completing the last equation.</p>
<p>“See? Nothing—“  the chestnut haired girl was interrupted by a long yawn, “—to  it.”</p>
<p>I looked over at the  clock to see that it was already past one in the morning, “Oi, I  didn’t mean to keep you up so late…”</p>
<p>“Mmh, don’t worry  about it,” Shizuru answered with a small shake of her head, but I  could blatantly see the exhaustion in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll get out  of your hair so you can get some sleep,” I said as I began to  stand.</p>
<p>“I can’t let you go  out at this hour…plus it’s freezing outside,” she protested as  she stood as well. I noticed that I had grown slightly since the  first time we met as she now only had an inch or so on me in height.  Elsewhere…well, let’s just say I had some more growing to do…</p>
<p>“Then what am I  supposed to do?” I questioned her.</p>
<p>“Stay here for the  night. There is an extra bed, you know.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be  any trouble…”</p>
<p>“You will be if you  keep arguing with me.” Shizuru sternly answered.</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“Don’t!” she  threatened, placing her index finger against my lips, silencing me  immediately.</p>
<p>I gave her a defeated  look and mumbled a consent, which only caused her to beam  triumphantly, “Good. Now, off to bed with you.”</p>
<p>Shizuru proceeded to  usher me over to one of the beds, and once there I was promptly  shoved down onto the mattress. I squinted my eyes at her back as she  turned around to her closet.</p>
<p><em>I can’t believe  she’s treating me like a kid…</em></p>
<p>Spinning back around,  Shizuru tossed a blanket in my direction, and I snatched the thing  from mid-air with one hand.</p>
<p>“Just in case,” she  told me as she turned on her lamp.</p>
<p>My eyes follow her as  she glided over to the door and flipped the switch beside it causing  the room to darken significantly, the soft glow from the lamp being  the only source of light now.</p>
<p>Once she was back at  her bed, Shizuru gracefully slipped under the covers. I was quick to  follow suit.</p>
<p>“Goodnight, Natsuki.  If you need anything, just wake me up, alright?”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>I heard the quiet<em>‘click’</em> of the lamp being turned off before the room  became completely dark. It was followed by the sound of ruffling  sheets before everything became silent once again.</p>
<p>I lied in that  unfamiliar bed for several minutes just staring up at the ceiling,  but the sound of more rustling from the bed to my right caused me to  turn my head in the direction. I could see Shizuru staring at me  thanks to the moonlight that was filtering through the blinds hanging  over the windows at the heads of both beds.</p>
<p>“Wh-What?” I  managed to sputter somewhat nervously.</p>
<p>“Nothing…it’s  just that no one’s ever spent the night here before.”</p>
<p>“Oh...I’m sorry?”</p>
<p>She laughed at me  quietly, causing that familiar pink to appear on my cheeks.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“Hey, Natsuki?”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“What are your  parents like?”</p>
<p>The question caught me  off guard, and I shifted onto my elbows to look at her more intently.  She returned my gaze, head still resting on her pillow, a look of  absolute seriousness on her face. I had never talked about my parents  to anyone before, but that look in her eyes…</p>
<p>I dropped myself back  down onto the soft cushiony mattress with a sigh. Staring up at the  ceiling again, I remained quiet for a time before finally speaking.</p>
<p>“…Mom…mom was  always so smart. I couldn’t understand her sometimes, she always  liked to use big words…but I knew she loved me. She was never the  ‘ideal mom,’ you know, cooking and cleaning and all that…She  was always working it seemed, but she always let me stay around her  even when she was busy.”</p>
<p>“…And your father?”</p>
<p>“Dad was never around  too much. He flew around the world dealing with business and the  like…We always had fun when he was around though. He’s the one  who taught me how to ride a motorcycle…He always loved bikes. I  guess I got that from him…”</p>
<p>“Where are they now?”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“…Mom…died…a  few years ago…and dad, heh, who knows with him.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>After a small bout of  silence, Shizuru let out a curt bittersweet laugh, “I guess we both  have family issues, huh?”</p>
<p>“Yeah…” I turned  to look over at her, “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>This time, she looked  up to the ceiling, “I was debating whether or not I should go home  for the winter break.”</p>
<p>“Back to Kyoto?”</p>
<p>“Mmh.”</p>
<p>Another silence.</p>
<p>“You said you hadn’t  been back since you first came here, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“…Well, that’s a  decision you have to make for yourself,” she turned to look at me  as I continued, “You can’t run away from things forever.”</p>
<p>I caught a glimpse of  her familiar smile in the moonlight, “You’re right…Thanks,  Natsuki.”</p>
<p>And at that, the ruby eyed girl turned over onto her side and fell  asleep, me following her example soon after.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>Friday, December 14</em>
<p>The familiar beeping of  my alarm clock woke me from my peaceful slumber. I blindly smacked  the thing to make it stop as I heard a groggy groan come from the bed  beside my own. It took a moment for my still groggy mind to piece it  all together.</p>
<p><em>That’s right,  Natsuki stayed over…</em></p>
<p>I managed to pull  myself into an upright sitting position as I glanced over at the lump  in the other bed. It wasn’t moving. I rolled my eyes, the action  being followed by an unrestrained yawn.</p>
<p>“Come on, Natsuki. We  need to get up.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“Natsuki?”</p>
<p>Still no response.</p>
<p>A playful, albeit lazy,  grin appeared on my face as a plan to wake the sleeping biker was  weaved in my cruel little brain. It was amazing how those evil cogs  could turn this easily so early in the morning…I threw the covers  to the side as I pulled my legs up to my chest. I took a second to  position myself and gain my balance, and then…</p>
<p><em>Pounce!</em></p>
<p>“Ahh! Wha—!  Sh-Shizu—?!”</p>
<p>I landed on top of  Natsuki quite ungracefully, the raven-haired girl jolting at the  initial contact.</p>
<p><em>She surely didn’t  see that coming.</em></p>
<p>“Good morning,  Natsuki,” I greeted as casually as ever despite being sprawled  across her.</p>
<p>She pushed me off, and  I shifted the rest of the way so I was no longer pinning her down.</p>
<p>“What was that for?”  she questioned me as she sat up while blinking rapidly, obviously  still stunned from the rude awakening.</p>
<p>After propping my head  up with one hand, I shoved a finger on the other into her forehead,  “<em>YOU</em> wouldn’t get up.”</p>
<p>“And so you jumped on  me?!” she asked, taking a hold of my wrist to pull my finger away  from her.</p>
<p>I shrugged, “I tried  calling Natsuki’s name, but you never answered. I feared for the  worst…I had to make sure you were still alive.”</p>
<p>“And I guess a gentle  shake of my shoulder was <em>totally</em> out of the question…” she  sarcastically retorted.</p>
<p>I simply smiled at her  as I sat up, “I think we both know that wouldn’t have worked.  Natsuki was sleeping so soundly, just like a baby…and just as  cute.”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened at my  last statement, cheeks flushing vibrantly, “Don’t say things like  that! Eh!”</p>
<p>I notice her eyes fall  to my chest before quickly darting away, and after following their  gaze, I saw just why the girl had reacted the way she did. Apparently  my robe had slipped down slightly after my little stunt revealing the  top of my ample bosom.</p>
<p><em>Opportunity…</em></p>
<p>“Mou, Natsuki doesn’t  like what she sees?” I playfully inquired with a tiny pout.</p>
<p>The girl shook her head  violently back and forth, the color in her face taking on a new shade  of red as she quickly retreated from the bed. I mentally chuckled at  the sight.</p>
<p><em>Ah, Natsuki…such a  prude…It’s not like you could actually </em><em><strong>see</strong></em><em> anything…</em></p>
<p>I pulled the soft cloth  back over my shoulders before getting off of the bed myself. “Well,  now that we’re <em>both</em> up, how about some breakfast?”</p>
<p>“I-I really should be  leaving…” Natsuki replied, still refusing to look at me.</p>
<p>“Already?” I  sounded like a complaining child.</p>
<p>“Yeah, my uniform is  at my apartment anyway, I need to go get it.”</p>
<p>“And will you  actually come to school after doing that?”</p>
<p>She glowered at me  slightly before snapping her answer, “Yes.”</p>
<p>I let out a  disheartened sigh, “Ara…I guess I can’t stop you then. I guess  I’ll talk to you later?”</p>
<p>She seemed to relax  again.</p>
<p>“Mmh,” she nodded  at me, our eyes meeting, “Mind if I use your bathroom first  though?”</p>
<p>I motioned for her to  go ahead, and watched as she retrieved her leather biker suit from my  closet before entering the bathroom, closing the door behind her. I  took this opportunity to change into my school uniform, and not too  soon after I had finished, Natsuki emerged from around the corner and  placed her spare pajamas back into my closet.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m off.”</p>
<p>I looked up at her from  my seat on the bed where I was currently pulling up my socks,  “Alright. Drive safely, okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah,” she  said with a flick of her hand as she collected her things.</p>
<p>“Good luck with the test!” I called after her as she headed out  the door, and I smiled as I heard the bike outside come to life and  sped off down the road a few minutes later.</p>
<p><em>That girl…</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“So how did it go?  Math is your second class of the day, right?”
<p>It was lunchtime and  Natsuki and I were meeting at our alternate secret spot near the top  of the stairway leading to the roof since it was too cold to eat  outside in the garden now. We generally made it a custom to meet here  for lunch <em>at least</em> on Fridays. We never knew if we would see  each other on the weekends, so meeting now only made sense. I’m  still not exactly sure how she managed to slip into the high school  unnoticed…Even on the Fridays she didn’t come to school, I would  always find her here come lunchtime. It made me happy to see her keep  that promise despite what she had been doing outside of school.</p>
<p>Actually, we had been  seeing a lot less of each other in the past month, but Natsuki  assured me that it wasn’t anything personal, she just had a lot of  things going on. Of course, <em>“a lot of things”</em> was never  given any specific details, but I decided it would be best not to  push the subject. Instead I would enjoy the time that we did get to  spend together, especially since she seemed to be talking more and  more when we did meet up. We were continuing to become more natural  around each other, and I was quite pleased about that improvement.</p>
<p>Lowering herself to the  concrete steps, Natsuki took the maroon bento from my outstretched  hands. It had also become custom for me to make her lunch on the days  I knew we would be meeting. She had protested at first, not wanting  to be a bother as she always said, but I of course was successful in  winning that battle. I rather enjoyed getting to make lunch for  Natsuki. It was just another little thing I could do for her. Plus I  enjoyed seeing her face light up as she ate the food I delicately  prepared for her.</p>
<p>The girl before me  smirked slightly as she opened the box, “I think I did alright. I  always seem to have uncanny luck when it comes to tests…generally  not math ones, but I think today was one of the rare exceptions.”</p>
<p>“<em>I</em> think you  don’t give yourself enough credit,” I said, tapping her on the  head with one of my chopsticks. “You’re smarter than you think.”</p>
<p>She blushed slightly as  she took a piece of fish between her utensils, “Yeah, maybe. And  what about you? You haven’t been falling asleep in class today  because of me, have you?”</p>
<p>“Is Natsuki worried  about me missing my lessons?” I questioned in a singsong tone.</p>
<p>“Psh. I guess I’ll  take that as a <em>no</em>,” Natsuki stated as she placed the fish  into her mouth.</p>
<p>I chuckled before  digging into my own lunch.</p>
<p>There was a natural  silence between us as we both ate, but it didn’t last for too long.</p>
<p>“So, have you thought  any more about what we talked about last night?”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“About going home.”</p>
<p>“Oh, well, a little,”  I answered.</p>
<p>“When is the break  anyway?”</p>
<p>“From December  twenty-sixth until January sixth, I do believe.”</p>
<p>“So I guess you’d  be spending the whole time down there?”</p>
<p>“Maybe…” I eyed  her curiously, “Why are you so interested?”</p>
<p>“Just curious. I  thought it was pretty important to you, so I should naturally be  interested, right?”</p>
<p>I smiled at her  innocent honesty. Sure there were still things she withheld from me,  and there was still a lot that we didn’t know about each other, but  it was moments like this that convinced me that we truly were  friends. Our friendship might not match what others might deem  normal, but that didn’t matter to me. Time. That was all we needed.  One day I knew that we would know each other just as well as we knew  ourselves. I didn’t care if our relationship wasn’t like anyone  else’s, in fact, I didn’t want it to be. What Natsuki and I had  was something special, unique…something deeper than a mere  friendship. At least, that’s what I felt in my heart.</p>
<p><em>I wonder if you feel  the same?</em></p>
<p>“Well, I still have a  little time to decide.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“And what do <em>you</em> plan to do?” I turned the interrogation her way.</p>
<p>“The usual. Exercise,  research…maybe an overnight trip.”</p>
<p>“Trip? To where?”</p>
<p>She sent me that look  telling me to stop with my questions now. I released an agitated  sigh, actually letting some emotion shine through my usually calm  demeanor.</p>
<p>It was tough just  sitting around not knowing what it was Natsuki was doing in her free  time. It especially made it hard when she would disappear and show up  a couple of days later with a battered and bandaged body. It made my  heart ache to see her like that, but I knew better than to ask what  had happened because I knew I would never get a straight and honest  answer. I knew that one day all would be clear between us…that we  would reach a day where we would hold nothing back from the other and  have no secrets…Now it was only a matter of waiting for that day to  come, but oh how I hated waiting when it came to Natsuki.</p>
<p><em>But</em> <em>I’ll  hold on if it’s for you, Natsuki…only you…</em></p>
<p>The lunch break was  over far too soon, and at the sound of the bell, we reluctantly  placed the tops back on our bentos. Natsuki handed hers back to me,  and I slipped the now empty box into my bag beside my own vacant  bento.</p>
<p>We continued our  conversation as we made our way back down the few flights of stairs.</p>
<p>“You have any plans  for the weekend?” she questioned me.</p>
<p>“Not really, mainly  just studying for the end of term exams. You?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you know, this  and that,” she replied, dodging my question as usual.</p>
<p>“And some studying  too…” she quickly added.</p>
<p>“You’d better be, I  don’t want any last minute study secessions for the exams.”</p>
<p>Her face crumbled,  “B-But you said…”</p>
<p>“Just kidding,” I  reassured her with a smile and a small poke to the ribs that caused  her to flinch, “If Natsuki needs help, then help she’ll get. And  don’t worry, it’s not any trouble either.”</p>
<p>She seemed satisfied,  and relieved, with my response, “Well, don’t be surprised if I  show up at your door at some ungodly hour in the morning…and I  don’t want to hear any complaints so you’d best remember your  words, Shizuru.”</p>
<p>“Natsuki at my door  is the best surprise I could ever receive, and I would certainly  never complain about spending time with her.”</p>
<p>“Bah!” the  raven-haired girl exclaimed, waving me off as her cheeks flared.</p>
<p>I chuckled to myself as  we exited the stairwell, letting my eyes linger on her retreating  back as she snuck back to the middle school for the remainder of  the day.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I slipped into the  classroom and weaved my way over to my desk beside the window,  immediately taking to my usual activity of gazing out the window.  Nothing special was going on outside, mainly just a few straggling  students rushing off to class. That was when a conversation between  two of my classmates peeked my attention, and I tuned in without  making it obvious.
<p>“<strong>So, guess what I  heard.” </strong></p>
<p><em>Here comes another  stupid rumor…</em></p>
<p>“<strong>Hm? What?”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Rumor has it that  Miss Fujino-san’s birthday is next Wednesday.” </strong></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“<strong>Really? How did  you find that out?” </strong></p>
<p><em>Wha…</em></p>
<p>“<strong>I overheard some  of the high schoolers talking about it this morning.” </strong></p>
<p><em>It’s…Shizuru’s…</em></p>
<p>“<strong>Ooo wow,  Fujino-san is so amazing…so how old is she going to be?”</strong></p>
<p><em>...birthday?</em></p>
<p>“<strong>I’m not sure.  She’s a 2</strong><strong>nd</strong><strong> year, so she’s bound to be  like 15 or 16.”</strong></p>
<p>…<em>it’s 16.</em></p>
<p>“<strong>Yeah, I guess  you’re right. I wonder what kind of presents she’s going to get?”</strong></p>
<p>…<em>Shizuru…</em></p>
<p>“<strong>Whatever she  wants I’m sure. I mean, her family is pretty well off from what  I’ve heard.”</strong></p>
<p>…<em>but they’re not  around…</em></p>
<p>“<strong>Yeah, and with a  daughter like that I’m sure her parent’s just drown her in praise  and gifts. I certainly would.”</strong></p>
<p><em>What do you know...</em></p>
<p>“<strong>Me too. I wish I  could just be </strong><em><strong>half</strong></em><strong> as talented as Fujino-san.”</strong></p>
<p><em>You don’t know  Shizuru…</em></p>
<p>“<strong>Don’t we all?”</strong></p>
<p>The two girls burst  into a fit of giggles, but they were soon interrupted by our teacher  entering the room, silence taking over as she commanded us to settle  down so she could begin her lesson. She began teaching, but I was  certainly not paying attention.</p>
<p><em>Wednesday…the  19</em><em>th</em><em>? December 19</em><em>th</em><em>?  So that’s her birthday…She didn’t say anything about it…of  course she didn’t say anything about it, stupid, nobody goes around  boasting about their own birthday…But now that I do know, I should  get her something...I want to get her something, but…I’ve never  got a present for anyone before…I don’t know what she’d want…</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>Shit.</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>Saturday, December  15</em>
<p>I was miserable,  absolutely miserable. And frustrated. I was a whole lot of that too.</p>
<p>I had just got back to  my apartment after an entire afternoon of shopping, and I didn’t  have a present for Shizuru to show for it. On top of that, I still  didn’t even have the slightest <em>idea</em> of what to get her.</p>
<p><em>Why do I have to be  so bad at these kinds of things?!</em></p>
<p>I continued pacing back  in forth in my living room trying to think of something…<em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>“Bah!” I exclaimed  as I threw myself down onto the couch. I snatched up the remote and  violently mashed the ‘Power’ button.</p>
<p><em>Maybe some ad will  come on and give me an idea.</em></p>
<p>I watched the damn  thing for five straight hours.</p>
<p>I still didn’t have a clue.</p>

<em>Tuesday, December 18</em>
<p>It was tomorrow.  Shizuru’s birthday was tomorrow. <em>TO-MOR-ROW</em>. I was  officially freaking out.</p>
<p>Two full days had just  passed me by. I don’t know where the time went.</p>
<p>Sunday I was  exercising. My mind always worked better when I was exercising. I  worked to my complete and utter exhaustion. I was still sore all over  from it. So how come I still hadn’t come up with any ideas on a  present for Shizuru?</p>
<p>I somehow managed to  avoid her Monday at school. If I had seen her, if we had talked, I  probably would have blurted out my irritation to her face. And that  wouldn’t have been good, not good at all. Unfortunately I wasn’t  as lucky today.</p>
<p>“Natsuki!” I heard  the familiar Kyoto-ben accent call out my name as I was walking to  school.</p>
<p><em>Oh no…</em></p>
<p>I turned to see the  chestnut haired beauty waving at me as she walked in my direction.</p>
<p>“Sh-Shizuru, hey…”</p>
<p>“I didn’t see you  at school yesterday…I thought you were trying to do better about  actually <em>attending</em> class.”</p>
<p><em>Just stay calm…</em></p>
<p>“Huh? Oh, well,  something came up.”</p>
<p>She cocked her head to  the side, “I see…Anyway, are you busy after school?”</p>
<p><em>I need to get out of  here…</em></p>
<p>“Yeah, sort of.  Sorry.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” she looked  slightly disappointed before slipping back into her usual cheery  self, “Well, I guess it wasn’t anything all that important...”</p>
<p><em>Now…</em></p>
<p>“Eh, sorry, but I’ve  got to go. See ya!”</p>
<p>“A-Alright…bye…” I heard her say to me, confusion evident in  her tone.</p>
<p><em>Sorry, Shizuru…</em></p>

<em>Wednesday, December  19</em>
<p>I lied in bed staring  blankly up at the ceiling before eventually managing to turn my head  to look at the clock.</p>
<p><em>3:31 AM</em></p>
<p>I mumbled an inaudible  curse as I returned to my previous position.</p>
<p><em>I can’t believe I  still haven’t got her anything. Shizuru deserves SOMETHING. She  deserves something special…and it’s supposed to be the thought  that counts, isn’t it? She doesn’t even have her family around to  celebrate with her…Birthdays are supposed to be special, right?  Will she not feel that way since no one’s here for her? But I’m  supposed to be here for her…Agh… </em></p>
<p>I shut my eyes as I  shifted my arm over my face to cover them. I stayed there for several  minutes before it suddenly hit me. Like a sack of wonderfully heavy  bricks it hit me.</p>
<p>I snapped up into a  sitting position, “That’s it!”</p>
<p>I bolted out of bed,  disregarding the sheets that I inevitably end up dragging with me  across the room. I went to my closet, and after flinging the door  open, I pulled out a box from the back, leaning over it as I  frantically dug through the thing.</p>
<p>“Come on…I know  it’s in here…Aha!”</p>
<p>I took the item out,  grasping it tightly in my hand, “Now for a box…”</p>
<p>Racing over to the  other side of the bedroom, I dug into the various boxes stacked up  against the wall from when I first moved in. Inside one of the larger  boxes I found one that would work, although it was a little bigger  than I needed. To solve that problem, I grabbed one of my old  newspapers from earlier this week and stuff a few pages inside. Not  having anything to use for wrapping paper, I simply closed the lid  and went downstairs to find a piece of twine to tie around it.</p>
<p><em>Not exactly  glamorous, but it’ll have to do.</em></p>
<p>Placing the box on the  counter in the kitchen, I desperately tried to collect my scrambled  thoughts, “Clothes…need to change clothes.”</p>
<p>I rushed back upstairs  and over to my closet and began shifting through all the articles  inside.</p>
<p><em>It’s gonna be cold  out there…I hope she won’t mind.</em></p>
<p>I grabbed a pair of  jeans and a couple of shirts to layer on top of one another. After  changing out of my pajamas, I took my heavy grey coat with the fur  around the hood along with my navy scarf and gloves.</p>
<p>I was halfway down the  stairs before I stopped, “Blankets…”</p>
<p>I quickly retrieved two  of them from the top shelf in my closet before once again going back  to the bottom floor and stacking them next to Shizuru’s present.</p>
<p>“Now for some  snacks.”</p>
<p>I found a plastic  grocery bag and proceed to throw a couple of packaged bean paste  breads inside.</p>
<p><em>Hopefully she eats  those…Everyone likes those things, right?</em></p>
<p>I quickly prepared some  hot chocolate, pouring the steaming liquid into two thermoses and  making sure the tops were screwed on tight before placing them in the  plastic bag as well.</p>
<p>After doing a quick once over, I grabbed all the items that I had  collected and headed out the door.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
A brisk knocking at my  door jerked me awake.
<p>“Wha...?” I turned  under my sheets, but made no move to actually get up.</p>
<p>After a moment, the  noise came again, only louder this time.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright…”  I grumbled.</p>
<p><em>Who could it be this  early in the morning?</em></p>
<p>I dragged myself over  to the door. Looking out the peephole, I gasped at what I saw,  quickly unlocking and opening the door.</p>
<p>“Natsuki?” I  questioned, my voice still containing its drowsiness.</p>
<p>“Come on, Shizuru,  you need to get dressed,” she informed me as she barged right past  me and into my dorm.</p>
<p>“Huh?” I muttered  as I spun around, “What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>She was already at my  closet, digging through the contents inside.</p>
<p>I received no response.</p>
<p>“Ara, what are you  doing? You sure are acting strange…Do you need help studying or  something?”</p>
<p>“No, not now. We have  more important things to attend to,” she informed me as she pulled  out a pair of my jeans, a couple of shirts, and a sweater, “Here,  put these on, it’s pretty cold out there.”</p>
<p>“Natsuki, I…I don’t  understand—”</p>
<p>Finally she turned to  me, looking me straight in the eyes, “Just do it, Shizuru. You’ll  find out soon enough.”</p>
<p>Pointing a finger at  me, she continued, “Oh, and you can’t ask any questions. Not yet  anyway.”</p>
<p>I noticed an unfamiliar  twinkle in her eye…Playfulness maybe? No, more like childish  excitement.</p>
<p>Deciding to go along  with her little game, I changed into the clothing Natsuki had picked  for me as she busied herself elsewhere in my dorm. Once I was  finished changing and had slipped into my tan coat, red scarf and  matching gloves, we headed out into the chilly darkness of the early  morning.</p>
<p>We rode on Natsuki’s  motorcycle for about ten minutes before she finally stopped at a  roadside cliff. Although I was baffled at our location, I didn’t  ask any questions as previously instructed. We dismounted from the  bike, and Natsuki helped me climb over the metal railing before  vaulting back over it and going back to her bike. I peeked over my  shoulder, watching her remove some items out of the back storage  compartment of her vehicle before heading back to where I was  standing. She set the little pile down and spread out a blanket  before motioning to me.</p>
<p>“Sit down.”</p>
<p>I did as she said, and  soon after she whipped out another blanket and wrapped it around me,  placing one of the ends in my hand as she sat close beside me and  kept the other end to herself.</p>
<p>“Phew, I wish it  didn’t have to be so cold out,” she declared, pulling the blanket  around us tighter before she reached for the bag she brought with  her.</p>
<p>I shifted a little bit  closer to her.</p>
<p><em>I certainly don’t  mind</em>.</p>
<p>“You hungry?” she  asked as she passed me what appeared to be a packaged bean paste  bread.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” I said,  speaking for the first time since we had left my dorm as I took the  item.</p>
<p>She placed one in her  lap before pulling out two metal thermoses, “And a little something  to warm us up.”</p>
<p>I graciously took one  of the cups from her.</p>
<p>“It’s cocoa,” she  informed me, “You <em>do</em> drink things other than tea, don’t  you?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I responded  to her little jest as I unscrewed the top.</p>
<p>I took a few sips of  the thankfully still warm liquid.</p>
<p><em>That hit the spot.</em></p>
<p>We were silent for a  few minutes as we munched on our little treats and tried to warm  ourselves with the cocoa until I finally couldn’t take it anymore.</p>
<p>“So, can I <em>now</em> ask why you woke me up at four-something in the morning to bring me  out here in the freezing cold? It wasn’t just to have snack time,  was it?”</p>
<p>She remained quiet, a  grin quickly spreading across her face.</p>
<p>“Natsuki?”</p>
<p>She turned to her  right, and the next thing I knew, there was a small brown box sitting  in my lap. I speechlessly blinked at the thing.</p>
<p>“Open it.”</p>
<p>My numb gloved fingers  pulled at the twine looped around the box, and it came off quite  easily. I lifted the lid, and after removing some of the paper  inside, I discovered a small stone. I stared at it resting in my  palm. I could see it sparkle both red and green in the first visible  sunrays of the dawn.</p>
<p>Before I could say  anything, Natsuki spoke as she herself eyed the stone in my hand, “I  found that when I was younger. My mother told me it was pretty rare  to find an emerald and a ruby naturally fused together like that…I  held on to it ever since, but I want you to have it. I know it’s  not much but—”</p>
<p>We both broke our gaze  from the stone to look at each other.</p>
<p>“Happy Birthday,  Shizuru.”</p>
<p>I let out a small  laugh, “How did you…I never told you when my birthday was...”</p>
<p>She simply shrugged, “I  have my ways.”</p>
<p>“Elusive as ever,”  I mocked as I gave her a soft elbow shot to the ribs before turning  my attention back to the stone, “It really is beautiful though…”</p>
<p>Taking a small risk, I  turned to her and wrapped my arms around her neck, pulling her into  an embrace. Surprisingly she didn’t fight back in the least.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Natsuki,”  I whispered into her ear.</p>
<p><em>Thank you…so much…</em></p>
<p>“Mmh.”</p>
<p>I could feel the tears  beginning to form in my eyes as I held on to her a little longer than  I needed to.</p>
<p>We sat in the cold,  huddled beside each other as we watched the sun rise, but we didn’t  feel the bitter winter air nipping at us.</p>
<p>Eventually we drove  back to my apartment, both of us crashing on my bed as soon as we  arrived, only bothering to shed our shoes and winter gear. We were  only there for around thirty minutes before my alarm sounded. I  immediately turned it off, but when I reluctantly tried to move to  get up, I felt a hand lazily swipe at my arm, successfully latching  onto a few of my fingers, and giving them a small tug.</p>
<p>“Un-uh…” came the  sleepy muffled disapproval from the girl beside me who still had her  eyes closed.</p>
<p>A loving smile appeared on my tired face, and with a shake of my  head, I lied back down.</p>
<p>Despite it being the end of the term, we skipped school on this  chilly December day together.</p>
