<h1>Final Distance (part 29 of 30)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jaded.html">jaded088</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/finaldist-ch28.html">Back to Part 28</a><p>“Mom, would you just…would you just listen to me for a minute?” Natsuki’s voice was both 
pleading and slightly annoyed as she followed her mother across the woman’s bedroom and into 
the hallway.</p><p>Although they had met at the courthouse, Saeko Kruger convinced her 
daughter to hold off on any discussions until they could go back to the place she was 
staying, and somewhat reluctantly, Natsuki had agreed. Since the girl had been gone, Saeko 
had been placed in a temporary house in the city of Seris, but even the politician had not 
expected the home away from home to be quite so large. It was a mansion, really— a residence 
much larger than any in Anis. Then again, the Northern capital was known to be a home for 
Vedel’s richer residence, and considering that the war had just ended mere months ago, it 
wasn’t completely surprising that Saeko felt uncomfortable living in a now-abandoned abode 
that once belonged to one of Seris’s late generals. If that wasn’t enough, she lived in the 
place alone, with the exception of her brother in-law Jousuke Kruger, who didn’t feel any 
better about staying in the manor. Most of the time, neither of them was there, mainly just 
using the place as somewhere to sleep, but today was an exception, on account of Natsuki’s 
unexpected visit.</p><p>Entering the room that she was currently preparing for her 
daughter’s friend Shizuru, Saeko sighed, not looking at Natsuki as she covered the queen 
sized bed with a set of pure-white sheets, “I heard you the first time, Natsuki. You want to 
stay at Garderobe.”</p><p>“And did you hear what I said <i>after</i> that?” the raven-haired 
girl questioned, leaning against the nearest bedpost.</p><p>“What else is there to know?” 
the other woman stated, her no-nonsense tone making Natsuki grimace.</p><p>“A lot, 
actually,” Natsuki countered, “Oleander-sama wants me to be the next Gakuenchou. If you 
thought that me becoming an Otome was an achievement, now I’m going to be a Column, and the 
headmistress of all of Garderobe.”</p><p>Finally stopping what she was doing, Saeko looked 
up, staring her daughter directly in the eyes. “But what does that mean for <i>Vedel</i>, 
Natsuki? We were supposed to fix this broken country together.”</p><p>“This is about more 
than just Vedel; that’s what I’m trying to tell you,” the emerald-eyed girl replied, taking 
a seat on the half-prepared bed and waiting until her mother did the same before she 
continued, “This whole continent is messed up, mom. As the head of Garderobe, I might be 
able to help put things back in order with the other Otome.” Pausing for a moment, Natsuki 
sighed, taking one of Saeko’s hands into her own, “My place isn’t here, mom. Now that the 
war is over, everything is being discussed in the courts, and I’m certainly no politician…I 
trust you to handle things here, you’ve had things under control so far, haven’t 
you?”</p><p>Gazing down at her and her daughter’s intertwined fingers, Saeko sighed and 
closed her eyes, “It’s more than just that, Natsuki. It’s always been more than just that. 
After your father died, I…”</p><p>“Mom…”</p><p>“…I just wanted to keep you close by. Is it 
wrong for a mother to want to keep her daughter by her side? To keep her safe?”</p><p>“No, 
it’s not,” Natsuki quietly reassured the other woman, “but did you really expect me to stay 
here forever?” Thinking back on what Shizuru had said on the plane, the soldier reinforced 
her previous determination, “I have a life of my own to live, mom, and I think this is what 
I’m supposed to do. But I need your support…I can’t have you disagreeing with my 
decision.”</p><p>This girl…no, this young woman, Saeko thought to herself as she searched 
her daughter’s unwavering emerald-green eyes, was so much like her father. In the time 
Natsuki had been gone to Garderobe, she had developed Daisuke’s strong will, and his sense 
of justice. Their little girl was trying to do what she thought was best, and who could 
really say what was the right decision to make? As much as Saeko desperately wished that her 
husband were still here by her side in a moment like this, the truth was that he wasn’t. The 
man was gone, and she was left to make all of these important choices on her own now. Still, 
she knew how Daisuke would have felt about this…about their daughter and what she wanted, 
perhaps <i>needed</i>, to do.</p><p>After a brief pause, a small, wry smile formed on the 
older woman’s lips, “So you’re asking for my blessing, then?”</p><p>“I guess you could put 
it that way…” Natsuki replied with a small laugh, the heavy tension in the room finally 
seeming to dissipate, “Well?”</p><p>“It seems that my little girl is all grown up now,” 
Saeko commented as she arose, keeping her hand locked with her daughter’s as she stood 
before Natsuki, “The life of a leader isn’t an easy one, Natsuki—”</p><p>“I know it won’t 
be.”</p><p>“—And you’ll have to make a lot of hard decisions along the way—“</p><p>“I know I 
will.”</p><p>“—But I hope you know that I’ll always be here for you if you need me,” the 
woman finally concluded, caressing her little girl’s cheek in her free hand. Giving Natsuki 
a smile, Saeko’s eyes began to water, “I’m sure you’ll make a fine 
Gakuenchou.”</p><p>Standing, Natsuki drew her mother into an embrace, “Thank you, 
mom.”</p><hr><p>While Natsuki and Saeko were upstairs talking, Shizuru Viola was left 
downstairs, sipping on a cup of hot tea, with a very awkward Jousuke Kruger sitting across 
from her. The man seemed too big for the chair he was sitting in, and the teacup he was 
holding seemed much too small for his large, bear-like hand. Still, the man had tried his 
best to keep up a conversation with the refined Column, and although she did not show it 
through her expression, Shizuru was quite amused by his efforts, though very grateful at the 
same time. This was the first time she had met any of Natsuki’s family, after all, and both 
her uncle and her mother seemed like very nice people, although drastically different from 
one another. Whereas Jousuke was a much friendlier individual, Saeko seemed very serious and 
business-driven. The woman was a politician, Shizuru kept reminding herself, one who had 
lost her husband to bloody feud that had only just concluded recently. It had been a shock 
to the Otome to see how very much Natsuki resembled her mother in appearance, and slightly 
in personality, too, and it left Shizuru wondering just how much the dark-haired girl took 
after her late father.</p><p>“S-So…” Jousuke spoke up after a brief period of silence had 
settled between the two as they enjoyed their afternoon tea.</p><p>“Yes?” Shizuru inquired, 
her voice as smooth and cool as always, and it intimidated the soldier across the table 
slightly.</p><p>Setting his cup down, Jousuke ran his hand over his bald head, “You and 
Natsuki are pretty close friends, huh?”</p><p>Smiling, the woman set her own cup down on the 
saucer she was holding with her free hand in her lap. “We’ve spent the last four years 
together,” she began, “we have gotten to know one another quite well in that time. Our 
relationship is one I treasure very dearly.”</p><p>“Yeah, I gathered that much,” the man 
responded, “considering that she kept having dreams about you.”</p><p>“Is that so?” Shizuru 
inquired, a pleased little smile gracing her lips as the conversation took an unexpectedly 
interesting turn.</p><p>“Yeah, she—!”</p><p>Suddenly catching his error, Jousuke abruptly 
shut his mouth. Although Natsuki had rarely spoken of this woman, or her time spent at 
Garderobe, Jousuke could tell that Shizuru meant a great deal to his niece. It wasn’t that 
Natsuki didn’t like other people, but the girl rarely opened up to anyone enough to be 
considered a friend. Perhaps that was due to her lack of a childhood, or maybe because all 
she had ever known was war and distrust, but whatever had happened at the school in 
Windbloom, this Otome sitting in front of him had managed to befriend his niece, and it 
seemed that Natsuki cherished her quite a bit as well. Hell, after seeing the lady in 
person, Jousuke couldn’t blame Natsuki for dreaming about her. She was one of the most 
beautiful women he had ever seen, but she was completely daunting at the same time. There 
was a strange air about her…one that he couldn’t quite put his finger on, but knew that it 
made him feel nervous under her russet gaze. Still, his opinion of Miss Viola was certainly 
a high one, and he tried his hardest to act on his best, and most sophisticated, behavior 
while he was around her.</p><p>After his blunder, Jousuke had been left mumbling incoherent 
words under his breath as he tried to think of a way to turn the conversation around, but 
thankfully at just the right time, Saeko and Natsuki could be heard descending the stairs, 
and the man breathed a sigh of relief. Shizuru, although disappointed in not learning any 
more about these apparent dreams her friend had had about her, turned her gaze away from 
Natsuki’s uncle and on to the highly identical mother and daughter as they came around to 
join the other two, Natsuki taking a seat beside Shizuru while Saeko took the chair beside 
Jousuke.</p><p>“Is everything still alright down here? My brother in-law hasn’t been acting 
as a rude host, has he?” the older woman questioned, and Jousuke sent her an apologetic look 
right after.</p><p>“He’s been delightful,” the Column replied with a smile as she poured 
both newcomers a cup of tea, “We’ve just been sharing secrets about 
Natsuki…”</p><p>“Wh-what?!” the girl in questioned exclaimed nervously, looking up at her 
uncle who’s face contorted into a grimace before she turned her eyes upon Shizuru who 
continued to grin cheekily.</p><p>Saeko merely chuckled at the jest. “I think I like this 
friend of yours, Natsuki,” she stated before taking a sip of her tea, and all Natsuki could 
do was groan in defeat as she could anticipate all of the tag-team teasing that was sure to 
follow for the rest of her and Shizuru’s stay in Vedel.</p>
