<p>Sixteen  Going on Seventeen</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><em><strong>Come  to the dorm. It’s an emergency. Please hurry.</strong></em></p>
<p align="center"><em><strong>-Shizuru</strong></em></p>
<p>That was the message I  had received on my cell five minutes ago. That was the message that  had effectively caused me to abruptly cut my meeting with Yamada  short, run out of the bar and go speeding down the road, through red  lights I might add, towards the school. I had tried calling the girl  at first, but when she didn’t pick up I began to get worried, that  anxiousness leading me to where I was now.</p>
<p><em>I’m almost there,  Shizuru…</em></p>
<p>A few minutes later,  the dorm building came into sight. I pushed my bike even faster to  close the distance, and nearly flipped myself when I made the turn  into the parking lot. Cutting the engine, I ignored removing any of  my gear as I ran into the building and up the small flight of stairs  to Shizuru’s floor. I didn’t even bother with knocking on the  door when I came upon 208, I just burst right through to see…</p>
<p>Shizuru. Sitting on the  couch. Casually reading a book.</p>
<p>“Ara, that was fast.”</p>
<p>My helmet was off in a  second, “Y-You’re perfectly fine?!”</p>
<p>“Yes, why wouldn’t  I be?” the Kyoto native questioned as she closed her book and  placed it on the nearby table.</p>
<p>“You just sent me a  message that—I thought you were—“</p>
<p>“Yes…?”</p>
<p>“I THOUGHT YOU WERE  HURT OR SOMETHING!”</p>
<p>“Is that why Natsuki  came so quickly?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah!”</p>
<p>“How sweet,”  Shizuru smiled.</p>
<p>“NO! Not <em>sweet</em>!  I was freaking out! Not to mention I was in the middle of something  important. I don’t have time for these dumb jokes,” I snapped  back, turning to make my leave.</p>
<p>The chestnut-haired  beauty was quick to stop me, grabbing me by the arm, “Wait! I’m  sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I did call you here for  something very important, and that isn’t a joke.”</p>
<p>“What?” I curtly  asked, my tone full of irritation.</p>
<p>“Do you know what  today is?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Do you know what  today is?” she pressed again.</p>
<p>I squinted at her, “A  Wednesday? Maybe? I don’t know…”</p>
<p>“So you really don’t  know…”</p>
<p>“Would you just get  to the point already?!”</p>
<p>Retreating to her  closet, I watched as Shizuru retrieved a box, came walking back over,  and promptly held the thing out to me.</p>
<p>“Happy Birthday,  Natsuki.”</p>
<p>I raised an eyebrow at  her, our gaze fixed even as I reached into my pocket to pull out my  phone. Sliding the thing open, I peered down at the small screen that  revealed to me that it was indeed August 15, the very day I had been  born on seventeen years ago.</p>
<p>“How did you…” I  began as I met burgundy eyes once again while placing the device back  into my pocket.</p>
<p>“Did Natsuki forget?  I am the President of the Student Council…I have access to all the  student’s records…So what do you think I did when I first  received my computer?”</p>
<p>I blushed at her words,  “Um…pulled up my profile…?”</p>
<p>“Correct!” Shizuru  chimed with a tilt of her head, her smile broadening. “Now, are you  going to accept my gift or not?”</p>
<p>“S-Sorry…” I  stammered as I took the box, allowing the girl to lead me over to the  couch to sit down.</p>
<p>After setting my helmet  on the floor and slipping out of my gloves, I began to remove the  blue wrapping paper that was delicately covering the box. Once it was  discarded and the box was opened, I pulled out a few pieces of tissue  paper before holding up the black sweater that was inside.</p>
<p>“I actually got it  for you when I went to Kyoto last year, but I never got the chance to  give it to you,” Shizuru noted, leaning in a little closer as she  spoke.</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>“There is more, you  know.”</p>
<p>To my baffled  expression, the girl merely chuckled before pointing at the box.  Removing a few more pieces of the thin tissue paper, the next items  that I laid my eyes upon were quite an odd pairing: a video game,  Final Fantasy XII, and a midnight blue knee-length negligee. My  expression must have intensified tenfold since Shizuru began laughing  at me yet again.</p>
<p>“The guy at the store  said it was a new release. I don’t know too much about games, so I  hope that you’ll like that one. And as for that,” my friend  pointed to the unmentionable, “it’s for your new collection. I  know that your old one was stolen during that whole lingerie burglar  mess.”</p>
<p><em>More like DESTROYED…</em></p>
<p>Ignoring the dreadful  memory, I smiled, “Thanks, Shizuru. But you really didn’t have to  get me so much…”</p>
<p>“I wanted to,” came  the honest reply. “Now, try it on.”</p>
<p>My eyes widened,  “Wh-Which…one…”</p>
<p>Shizuru jiggled her  eyebrows at me, and my jaw slackened.</p>
<p>She laughed, “The  sweater, silly. I want to see if it fits.”</p>
<p>I sighed in relief as I  stood, placing the box on the couch before I removed my jacket and  unzipped the top half of my suit, “It’s not like you could return  it after all this time anyway.”</p>
<p>“I know, but I want  to see how keen of an eye I really have,” Shizuru answered with a  wink.</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes at her  before slipping the article over my head. After properly situating  the sweater on me, I turned back to Shizuru.</p>
<p>“It’s…perfect.”</p>
<p>The buyer beamed and  gave me a triumphant nod, “Of course.”</p>
<p>“And you figured out  my size just by looking at me?”</p>
<p>“Hm, well, I guessed  that we were about the same size, so I judged it that way.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“Well then, you don’t  happen to have a change of clothes with you, do you?”</p>
<p>“No…Why?”</p>
<p>“Because we have a  dinner reservation at seven,” came the calm response as Shizuru  made her way over to her closet.</p>
<p>“What?! Where?”</p>
<p>“Da-Carlo’s.”</p>
<p>“That Italian place  downtown?”</p>
<p>“Mmh. You do like  pasta, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but…Well, I  figured you’d want to go to some high-end place.”</p>
<p>The brunette pulled out  a white and lilac summer dress and began walking towards the  bathroom, “Oh I was, but then I figured that you wouldn’t be too  comfortable in a place like that.”</p>
<p>“How considerate of  you…” I replied, my words laced with sarcasm as Shizuru  disappeared behind the door.</p>
<p>As Shizuru changed, I  packed my gifts back into their box and suited up for the ride back  into town. It didn’t take her too long to prep herself after she  had come back out, and in just a few minutes we were heading out the  door. After our belongings were secured in the back compartment of my  bike and helmets were properly in place, we straddled my Ducati.</p>
<p>“I’d make sure to  tuck your dress under you pretty tightly…unless you just feel like  flashing everyone we drive by.”</p>
<p>I received a playful  slap on the shoulder, “Natsuki! Promise me you’ll drive slow.”</p>
<p>“If I drive slow  we’ll never make it in time, especially since we’re having to  stop by my place first.”</p>
<p>“Then at least drive<em>slower</em> than usual for my sake, please?”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am,” I assured her before revving the engine, and  after I felt the girl snake her arms around my waist, we took off.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The stop by Natsuki’s  apartment was a brief one, so brief in fact, that the girl instructed  me to just stay with the bike while she changed. In her absence, I  scooted up on the seat of the vehicle Natsuki affectionately called<em>‘her baby’</em> and placed my hands on the handlebars.
<p>“I wonder why Natsuki  loves this thing so much…” I mumbled to myself as I shifted the  bar, causing the front wheel to turn back and forth.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me <em>you</em> want to drive…”</p>
<p>I snapped my head in  the direction of the voice and was met with amused emerald orbs. I  watched as Natsuki trotted over to me, now adorned in a pair of light  denim blue jeans and a simple black form-fitting t-shirt, slowing  down to a walk once she was close.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you  would let me even if I said yes,” I said, handing the raven-haired  girl her helmet.</p>
<p>“Heh, yeah, not until  you’ve had some lessons,” Natsuki stated, swinging her leg over  the bike after I had moved back on the seat.</p>
<p>I wrapped my arms back  around her waist, “Is Natsuki offering to teach me?”</p>
<p>She glanced over her  shoulder, “Do you really want to learn how?”</p>
<p>“I don’t see why  not,” I replied with a small shrug.</p>
<p>“I’ll think about  it…Another time though, we’d better hurry.”</p>
<p>The two of us took to  the road again, but the traffic slowed us down quite a bit. Once we  reached the restaurant, Natsuki dropped me off to claim our table  while she parked. It didn’t take long for me to be seated, making  sure to keep a lookout for my friend. A couple of minutes later  Natsuki entered, and I immediately stood and waved her over.</p>
<p>“Did you find a close  spot?”</p>
<p>“Relatively,” she  answered as she sat down.</p>
<p>Before our conversation  could continue, a waiter came up to our table, “Good evening,  ladies, my name is Toshiro and I’ll be your server tonight. May I  ask what you’d like to drink?”</p>
<p>“Water, please,” I  told the young man who probably wasn’t much older than myself.</p>
<p>“I’ll have the  same,” Natsuki followed.</p>
<p>“Alright…” the  waiter stated, “And would you like an appetizer?”</p>
<p>I looked across the  table expectantly.</p>
<p>Natsuki straightened,  “I don’t care.”</p>
<p>“Neither do I.”</p>
<p>“I guess not then?”</p>
<p>“Okay. I’ll be back  in a moment.”</p>
<p>In an instant, the man  disappeared. Picking up our menus, both Natsuki and I remained  relatively silent as we scanned the things. Every now and then I  would glance over the top of mine to gaze at the biker, her  expression of absolute concentration entertaining me to no end. She  really was quite adorable with that little frown on her face.</p>
<p>Eventually I set my  menu back down on the table, which inevitably alerted the other girl,  “You’ve decided already?”</p>
<p>“I think I’m just  going to get a salad,” I told her, “What about you?”</p>
<p>“The fettuccini, or  maybe the rigatoni…I can’t decide…”</p>
<p>“Well, you’d better  hurry,” I commented, spotting our waiter returning with our drinks.</p>
<p>After setting our  glasses down, the man proceeded to pull out his notepad, “Have you  decided on what you’d like?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll have the  Caesar salad with vinaigrette,” I requested, handing the menu to  Mr. Toshiro.</p>
<p>The waiter jotted down  my order before turning to Natsuki, “And for you?”</p>
<p>“Eh…I guess I’ll  have the rigatoni…” she weakly responded.</p>
<p>After taking the girl’s  menu, the man bowed politely, “You’re food should be out  shortly.”</p>
<p>The rest of the evening  was filled with good food, casual conversation, one very serious  debate about my <em>“addiction to tea”</em>, as Natsuki put it, and  my small victory of getting the girl to feed me across the table  without her being even remotely aware of what she was doing. I was  certainly thankful for my masking abilities since otherwise my broad  smile would have surely given me away.</p>
<p>Once we had both  finished and I had paid for our meal, which brought up the topic of  Natsuki still owing me dinner, we exited Da-Carlo’s and began  making our way to where the girl had parked her bike.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t I just  pay for tonight so we could be even?”</p>
<p>“Because <em>tonight</em> was a special occasion. You still owe me though.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah,” the  emerald-eyed girl waved me off, “So, do you have any other plans  for tonight that I’m unaware of?”</p>
<p>“No, not really,” I  replied, swinging my purse to hit her on the arm repeatedly.</p>
<p>Natsuki gave me a weird  look, but chose to simply ignore my childish act, “So, are we going  back to your place?”</p>
<p>“Already? But it’s  still early…”</p>
<p>“Hmm…Fine, I know  where we can go.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“There’s this park  just outside of town. I’ve never actually stopped by, but it seems  like a nice place to just relax.”</p>
<p>“Lead the way.”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
In a short while we  arrived at the park I had told Shizuru about. I waited for the girl  to remove her shoes before we headed out onto the grassy area that  was dimly illuminated by the moon and some nearby lampposts.
<p>I sat myself down on  one of the colorful swings, pumping my legs to gain some momentum as  Shizuru stood leaning against one of the metal poles holding up the  swing set.</p>
<p>“So, has Natsuki had  a good birthday?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, for once.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I guess I just don’t  have too many fond birthday memories like most kids.”</p>
<p>Shizuru took a seat in  the swing to my right, looking at me curiously as she began to swing  her legs, “Not even one?”</p>
<p>I pondered the question  for a moment and let out a small laugh at one particular memory,  “Well, maybe one…When I was four, my parents got me a dog…Duran…  He was my best friend growing up…That was probably the best one. I  couldn’t have asked for a better gift than him.”</p>
<p>“You were really  attached to him, huh?”</p>
<p>“Mmh. I never really  knew too many kids my own age, so Duran was the one I spent the most  time with.”</p>
<p>“You never befriended  anyone else?”</p>
<p>“Not really…Well,  not until I met you anyway.”</p>
<p>I didn’t have to look  at Shizuru to know that she was smiling; I could plainly hear it in  her voice, “So how come I got to be the lucky one?”</p>
<p>“I...I don’t know…I  guess I just felt like you actually cared or something…”</p>
<p>“Natsuki really is  too sweet…”</p>
<p>“Oh, shut up,” I  shot back, my cheeks flushing slightly.</p>
<p>Shizuru chuckled as she  continued to swing back and forth, but a few seconds later, I watched  the girl launch from her seat, her dress and honey-colored tresses  fluttering in the air, landing gracefully on the ground, but  releasing a sharp gasp in the process.</p>
<p>“You okay?” I  asked, jumping from my own swing, stumbling forward a bit upon  impact.</p>
<p>“Y-Yes, I just landed  kind of funny,” the burgundy-eyed girl proclaimed, but her limping  over to the nearest bench told me otherwise.</p>
<p>I jogged over, and  kneeling in front of her, I took her ankle in my hand, but when the  girl hissed quietly at the action, I immediately let go, “You  liar.”</p>
<p>“Really, it’s  nothing,” Shizuru insisted.</p>
<p>With a sigh, I pivoted  around, “Get on.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I’m carrying you  back.”</p>
<p>“Natsuki—“</p>
<p>“No arguing this  time, Shizuru. Get on,” I ordered again.</p>
<p>Complying, the brunette  laced her arms tightly around my neck, and after I had a secure grip  on her, I lifted us both and began the trek back to my Ducati.</p>
<p>“Honestly…you’re  such a troublemaker…” I playfully teased.</p>
<p>“Kanin na…I didn’t  mean to…” Shizuru pouted just as lightheartedly.</p>
<p>When we made it back to my motorcycle, I gingerly set Shizuru down  next to it, and once she had slipped back into her shoes, we left the  park, heading back towards her dorm.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Once we had made it  back to my building, Natsuki insisted that she carry me up to the  room, and of course I let her do so. Okay, so maybe my ankle didn’t  hurt <em>quite</em> as bad as I was making it out to be. I could have  easily walked up the stairs myself, but the raven-haired girl was  being so adamant about taking care of me that I couldn’t refuse.
<p>After we had made it  inside my room, Natsuki sat me down on my bed, “Alright, now that  we have some light, let me take a look at your ankle…Hmm, well, it  doesn’t look like it’s swollen—”</p>
<p><em>Busted?!</em></p>
<p>“—That’s a good  thing,” she added, looking up at me.</p>
<p><em>Phew…Close one.</em></p>
<p>“Even so, do you want  any ice?”</p>
<p>“No, that’s okay,”  I told her.</p>
<p>“Alright,” she  replied, sitting down next to me, “Huh?”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>I watched as the girl  got up, reached into my closet, and pulled out my violin case, “This  yours?”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you  could play,” Natsuki said, returning to her spot beside me on the  bed.</p>
<p>“I took lessons when  I was still living in Kyoto.”</p>
<p>“Did you stop?”</p>
<p>“When I moved up  here, yes.”</p>
<p>“But you can still  play, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>
<p>The girl promptly  shoved the instrument at me, “I want to hear you play.”</p>
<p>I laughed somewhat  skeptically, “Really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, really. It is  my birthday after all…And <em>this</em> is a birthday request.”</p>
<p>Taking the case from  her, I laid it on the bed as I removed my old violin and positioned  myself to play.</p>
<p>“No laughing if I  mess up,” I ordered before pulling the bow across the strings.</p>
<p>Closing my eyes, I  played what had to have been the shortest version of Kanon-D there  ever was. I hit a sour note here and there, but even so, once I had  finished, a soft sigh sounded from the girl beside me.</p>
<p>“That was…beautiful,  Shizuru.”</p>
<p>I placed the instrument  back into its case, “You’re just saying that—“</p>
<p>“No, I’m not. I  could never do something like that. You’ve certainly got a talent  for playing.”</p>
<p>“Ookini, Natsuki, but  it’s been such a long time since I’ve had any lessons.”</p>
<p>“Have you thought  about taking some here?”</p>
<p>“A couple of times,”  I admitted.</p>
<p>“Then you should.  Most definitely,” the girl replied as she stood.</p>
<p>It thrilled me to no  end that Natsuki appreciated something that I myself cared about very  deeply. She even supported me to continue playing, confidence that I  was in need of to actively pick up my violin again after all these  years. If she believed that I could do it, then how could I doubt  myself?</p>
<p>“Well, I think it’s  about time I headed back home,” the girl interrupted my thoughts.</p>
<p>“Mou…but I had  planned on this being a slumber party…”</p>
<p>A single eyebrow on my  friend’s beautiful face was raised, “Oh, really? I thought you  said earlier that you didn’t have any further plans.”</p>
<p>“This was merely  overlooked earlier,” I argued, tugging at the girl’s hand.</p>
<p>Natsuki huffed, “I  guess I can’t object then…So what now?”</p>
<p>“Movie time!” I  declared before pointing across the room, “To the couch!”</p>
<p>“Hai…” came the  less than enthusiastic response as the girl scooped me up in her arms  and lumbered over to the aforementioned piece of furniture.</p>
<p>Once I was in my usual  seat and had taken command of the remotes, I continued with my  instructions, “Natsuki can pick what we watch.”</p>
<p>“But I picked last  time,” she protested as she opened the movie drawer.</p>
<p>“But it’s Natsuki’s  birthday.”</p>
<p>When the girl’s  shoulders drooped and she turned back to the drawer, I knew I had  won.</p>
<p>“Seriously though,  you have no taste in movies…”</p>
<p>“I didn’t buy any  of those, thank you very much.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t buy a<em>single</em> one of these…?”</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>“They were gifts  then? From who?”</p>
<p>“Do you really have  to ask?”</p>
<p>“Eh…never mind…No  wonder they’re all romantic comedies, sheesh.”</p>
<p>Once the girl had finally, more like reluctantly, chosen one of the  DVDs and placed it in the player, she crawled back over to the couch  as I took over the rest of the necessary set up, and once everything  was ready and I pushed play, Natsuki and I settled in for another  lazy night spent together.</p>
