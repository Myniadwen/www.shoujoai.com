<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Maybe  / things happen for a reason / and wherein lies the answer / to  overcome the grieving / of life’s unruly lessons / I’m handed in  succession / it fills my faith which makes me… </em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Strong. </em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s mine / and it’s pure and / as decent as I can make myself. </em></span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Only the Strong #2</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even though it was his wrist  that was messed up, it was Minoru’s back that gave him the most grief  as he tried, unsuccessfully, to find a way up the hill he’d been  spotting from that didn’t involve clearing brush or grasping onto  branches for support, or both at once. It was one of the most  frustrating things he’d ever done; right on par with trying to navigate  through a dog park without stepping in somebody’s shit. Every time he  thought he’d found a path, something would block it; some dense thatch  of foliage or a set of trees and stumps that he couldn’t get over with  a heavy backpack and only one good hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was a painful  reminder that he wasn’t young anymore, really. Fifteen years ago, he  could have cleared this little piece of forest in ten minutes flat,  even with his wrist fucked up as it was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>cant seem to let go of </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>past that barely ever existed </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>not nearly as romantic </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">These thoughts still bothered him occasionally, but it was on very <em>rare </em>occasion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Plagued <em>is a better word. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  took him a solid twenty minutes of crashing through the forest like  Godzilla plowing through Tokyo looking for a decent puppeteer before he  finally made it around to where he’d come before. It was a fairly clean  trail, though the lack of foot-sized dents in the foliage here led him  to question whether or not he had actually been here before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Listen to yourself. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  minute after he’d started in, he noticed a foot-sized dent in the  leaves that covered the ground that was most certainly not his. He used  his good hand to reach into his holster and before he noticed that he  wasn’t having trouble with the latch, he had drawn his Beretta. It took  him a little off-guard to find that he could still draw that fast. He  hadn’t needed to draw in years, and it made him feel a little better;  he felt adrenaline start to flow through his body, limbering him up and  numbing the pain in his wrist.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Slow down, Minoru, </em>he thought. <em>If  somebody was up there, planning on shooting you, they’d have done it a  long time ago. Hell, they could have done it in the dark, you’re being  so damn loud. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Ambushes still happen, </em>he countered, unconcerned about the looming possibility of arguing with himself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  Scratch-ass probably wouldn’t be the one to order them; he’s more of a  shit-crazy nut than that. Remember what he said before? If one of you  dies— </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It clicked in his head a second later, and he  wondered how he had ever forgotten that creepy son of a bitch’s warning  in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>We’ll shoot the other. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  was looking in the wrong place. Ten minutes later (the other guy had  really chosen a much better spot to snipe from; no horrid ascent  plagued Minoru this time), he was up the hill several dozen meters from  his, and a moment later, he found what he was looking for: Nori. Very  dead Nori; blood had started to pool around his stomach from a thin  wound on his back: Somebody had put a knife through his spine, by the  looks of it; a pair of footprints on either side of his torso told him  as much, and told him that they’d done it without much of a pretense. <em>Or much of a struggle. The leaves and grass around him aren’t even riled up. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  frightened Minoru more than a little to think about that. Stealthy  bastards such as whoever had done this were the bane of snipers: You  couldn’t really flat-out charge somebody like Minoru and expect to make  it more than twenty feet, and Minoru’s senses, still-undulled in spite  of his age, were still very, very good. So for somebody to have taken  Nori—who couldn’t have been more than ten years younger than Minoru  (not to mention completely asexual and therefore impossible to  distract) completely off-guard like this…you didn’t get people that  good very often, and when you did, they tended to kill their share and  then some.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You’re so dead, </em>he thought without wanting to. <em>If you’ve got this ninja or whatever he is after you, </em>and <em>that crazy bastard Scratch-ass…and he </em>is <em>after you now. Now that your partner’s dead. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He didn’t like where this train of thought was heading, but like most trains, he was powerless to stop it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It  probably didn’t even occur to him that I wasn’t even in the area when  he died. Stupid bastard. This isn’t even sort of fair. Not at all like  the lazy years…at your age, up against somebody like him…you’re so  fucking dead. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But something occurred to him: <em>When  exactly did the lazy years end? Did they ever really end? Maybe it’s  harder to find jobs recently, but have they ever been tough? And if I’m  really going so far to pot, would I really be able to carry out tough  jobs? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru and Midori were more alike than they could  have known even if they had been closely acquainted for more than about  twelve hours. All at once, insecurity that he had never even recognized  surfaced, and then vanished as he thought, <em>it can’t be both, but it can certainly be neither. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Really,  Minoru was pretty lucky. The kind of insecurity he was experiencing now  usually hit people much harder, especially as they neared their  inevitable midlife crises; he hadn’t expected it to hit him at all, but  he supposed that was just hubris. He had probably started feeling that  way when he had been so thoroughly whupped by a bunch of kids, none of  whom were more than half his age except for Midori; there were  certainly worse reasons to angst about his age, but he couldn’t think  of them off-hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So don’t, asshole. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru shook  his head and turned to head back to the cabin, but not before giving  Nori’s corpse an obligatory “you dead?” nudge. He repeated the process  once for good measure; he had met a guy once in northern China that he  thought he’d killed, and that had sprung up and tried to kill him when  his back was turned. Admittedly, he’d botched the ambush terribly,  mostly due to the gaping hole that Minoru had left in his esophagus,  but still, it was worth another nudge.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If only the bastard had had the courtesy to drop his</em> <em>gun somewhere where I could find it, </em>he mused as he started back down the hill, using a different route than the one he’d used during his ascent. <em>Not that I’m jealous or anything, but that was certainly a nice scope. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You’re jealous. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  was, in fact, so jealous that he tripped over the meter-long metallic  tube that had lodged itself between a pair of trees. He lashed out with  both his good and bad hands just quickly enough to keep himself from  the kind of tumble usually reserved for extras in comedy movies and  action flicks, and, along with a fresh surge of pain from his bad hand,  he found himself afforded a lovely view of a mediocre rifle with a  massive scope.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru Alder was a lucky man indeed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or maybe not.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Mai was about <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">this </span></em>close  to having a nervous breakdown. She said that to herself, and even  thought up a little ruler to measure the space between the fingers she  envisioned smushed together in her mind’s eye. There wasn’t much to  measure.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She sighed and leaned back against the wall that divided the  boys’ and girls’ halves of the cabin, though admittedly, they were  presently in a state of relative integration; Midori had more or less  kicked the boys out of their half so that she could work on that guy  they picked up. That <em>guy. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Just some guy they picked up? Did Midori pick him up in a bar? That woman…</em>Mai shook her head, refusing to get as angry as she wanted to get, deep down inside. <em>Very </em>deep. <em>But still…who does that? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A lot of people. </em>Normal <em>people, who go out and do normal things. Who go meet people in bars if they don’t have boyfriends. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Who talk to their boyfriends if they do. Who do…other things. Whose boyfriends don’t let groupies hang off of them. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Normal people. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuichi nudged her with his elbow as he slid down next to her, and she jumped, coming about (again, <em>smush</em>) <em>this </em>close  to shrieking out in alarm, as though she hadn’t heard the toilet (which  was now busy swirling whatever Yuuichi had put in it about in a vain  attempt to sanitize itself) flush.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuichi noticed the shock on  her face, and, in spite of Mai’s every effort to prevent just such a  thing from happening, frowned. “Are you okay?” he asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  very obviously not, and it showed on her face in a way that anybody  could see if they paid attention and knew Mai, and which very few  people subsequently ever picked up on; a certain hesitation, like she  was willing the muscles of her face to <em>move damnit </em>and then a  smile, as cute as she could make it when it was so obviously forced.  Yuuichi didn’t like that smile on her; some guys probably went for the  frightened-schoolgirl look, because that was precisely what it was, but  Yuuichi had his own personal frightened schoolgirl that usually refused  to detach itself from his arm; it was enough to put just about anybody  off the habit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even through that smile, he could sense her  inwardly curling up into a little ball. It was something she did in the  face of something that she felt like she should bear rather than  actively trying to change: She smiled, bore it, and inwardly she  scrunched herself up into as small of a ball as possible, like a  protective shell. It worked for her; the tighter her ball got, the less  of anything she felt. The problem with this was that it also tended to  scare her away from other people; emotion was emotion, good or bad, and  you couldn’t differentiate when you were being defensive.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuichi hadn’t explicitly <em>worked </em>at  trying to get her to stop doing that; he believed that a person should  be allowed to feel how they want to feel, and interfering with other  people’s emotion was just insulting. But he <em>had </em>seen her slowly  begin to come out of that shell that she had built up around herself  for most of her life; the shell that had kept both he <em>and </em>Reito out for a long, long time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  fine,” she said, finally. It had taken her a lot of time to work up the  courage to lie fluently again. She had to do it less these days, and it  had become harder as practice became more scarce.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Obligatory lie  told, Yuuichi was now allowed to comfort her: Almost without thinking  about it, he reached around over her shoulders and pulled Mai into his  chest, and almost as soon as she touched it, she relaxed. Yuuichi could  practically see the tension drift off of her shoulders and up, in a  thin, wispy cloud, towards the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For a lot of people,  especially in Japan, this kind of an act was best saved for someplace  where, if privacy was impossible, the image of anonymity could at least  be maintained. For a lot of girls, resting their head against a boy  they liked meant a lot more than what it did for Mai Tokiha; it meant  some sort of mildly timid, even very, very vaguely sexual display of  affection.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai was just happy to be there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuichi grinned  down at her hair, lacking a decent view of her face as she nestled into  him, her face warm and soft against him; it was a grin that was an  affection that was somewhere near that of a child in that it was blind  and completely, utterly pure, and that was his, and only his.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  sat there like that for a little while that stretched into a space not  nearly long enough for Yuuichi’s taste, in silence; the only sound was  the gentle whisper of Mai’s breath on Yuuichi’s shirt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  Minoru screamed from the other room, Mai jerked against him, but said  nothing; Yuuichi, by that point, had gone into a serene, pleased,  halfway-meditative state, so what he thought first as Mai jumped and  brought him out of it was, <em>wow, Mai’s really warm. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What he thought next was, <em>she’s also very soggy. Is it raining? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">By  the third second, he’d put it together in his head, but he also knew  that he didn’t know what to do. He didn’t even know why she was crying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So ask her, stupid. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Easier  said then done. “M…Mai,” he managed to get out quietly, his words more  empathetic than his stutter would have suggested. “What is it?” He  pulled her a little tighter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She didn’t speak, and Yuuichi frowned. “What is it? Mai?” He pulled her a little tighter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Again, nothing. Yuuichi began to worry as the pool of wet on his shirt increased. <em>Is this something really serious? </em>He  thought, feeling that little ache in his belly specially reserved for  matters of grave import with regards to one’s love life. <em>Is there something wrong that she can’t tell me? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Or that I should be telling her? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Again, Yuuichi realized that he had no idea what to do in a situation like this except listen to what Mai had to say.<em> But she’s not saying anything. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Could it be about Shiho? Or about…</em>a little jerk in his stomach, <em>Reito? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  only vaguely occurred to him at this point that he was breaking his  agreement with Reito simply by holding Mai like this. What had he been  thinking when he made that agreement? What had <em>Reito </em>been thinking? Didn’t he know they were dating?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mai, please, say something to me. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mai, please. I can’t help you unless you talk to me. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I can’t ask you to talk any more than this. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Please. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mai. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  was gently tugging at the arm he had wrapped so tightly around her  head. He automatically loosened his grip, and Mai immediately pulled  out of his embrace, and in that moment, his stomach leaked entirely out  his bowels.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then she started panting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mai…?” he asked cautiously. “Please…tell me what’s…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It took her a moment to speak, and when she did, it was hesitant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was just thinking,” she said quietly, “about how long it’s been since we’ve gotten to be this close by ourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuichi nodded and shook his head with a sigh. “I know. I’m sorry about—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  apologize for Shiho,” Mai interrupted. Mai rarely interrupted people,  so when she did, you shut up and paid attention. “That’s what you were  about to do, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuichi nodded silently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t,” Mai  repeated. “I know you…and she…” there were about a million things  Yuuichi could think to put in those spaces, but he couldn’t decide on  any particular set. “But don’t. Mikoto apologized to me earlier, and  now she’s sulking, I think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you embarrassed about what Mikoto did?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  little,” Mai admitted. This made perfect sense to Yuuichi: Even if it  was sorely merited, Mai didn’t that kind of confrontation; she hated  it. Hated fighting with other people. Hated alienating other people  from herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be,” Yuuichi said. “I think I should have said something like that to her a long time ago. So <em>I’m </em>sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay,” Mai said automatically. “It’s no problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Bull. Shit. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two of them lapsed into silence, and Yuuichi thought, <em>now what? How rough has this really been for her? </em>The  way she’d said “it’s no problem” made Yuuichi understand very clearly  that he could never tell her about what he’d promised Reito, ever, and  the way she was acting told him….He glanced briefly at the massive wet  stain on his shirt. <em>Was this really…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That wasn’t all…” Mai said, ever-observant. (And articulate.) “It was…actually…ah…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It wasn’t what? It wasn’t tears of sadness? Pain? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It wasn’t tears for us? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>This is …this inability to really have time, to spend time together with </em>only <em>each other, it’s going to kill one of us, if not both. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Spit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuichi blinked. “What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I,  ah…” Mai wiped at her eyes with her palm. “When you had me pressed into  you…like that, I couldn’t…” She hesitated. A lot. “I couldn’t breathe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It took Yuuichi almost ten seconds to fully process this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When he did, he wasn’t sure if he was allowed to laugh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai did it for him. She dissolved completely into a small, genuine laugh, one which Yuuichi sincerely echoed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  don’t understand this girl all the time. She’s crying one second, and  laughing the next, and then I, who was scared out of his mind not two  minutes ago, is guffawing along with her.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What’s the next step? What’s left for me to learn?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What  happened next is best observed stepwise, as with the death of the poor,  well-constructed noodle display, because stepwise is how it would  forever be ingrained in Yuuichi’s memory; as a series of moments which,  by themselves, meant everything to him, and when strung together  resonated in his mind for a long time to come.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the first moment, Mai stops laughing. Yuuichi is still caught up in his open, honest chuckle—unbeknownst to him, Mai thinks, <em>I love that laugh, that laugh that he can bellow out without any reservation</em>;  she only tells him this years later, after he laughs at something she  mumbles as they both slide towards sleep in the aftermath of their  lovemaking—but Mai’s face has suddenly become very serious.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  the second moment, Yuuichi stops abruptly, and something in his stomach  starts wiggling around as he looks into her eyes and finds them staring  at his very, very steadily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the third moment, her stoic gaze wavers to his lips and the wiggling starts increasing in strength and frequency.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the fourth moment, Mai’s eyes slide closed. In the fifth, Yuuichi’s eyes follow suit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  the sixth moment, they kiss. Their kiss is passionate but quick. There  is no tongue to it, though some time into the future they find that  tongue is something they both enjoy with a passion. Mai leads; it is  her lips that close on Yuuichi’s, and not the other way around, because  of her self-doubt. Her suddenly raging insecurity that he will reject  her, throw her back and yell at her, and her inexplicable, undeniable  need to taste his lips at least once before he does. This is one of the  few selfish acts that Mai has ever engaged in, and certainly the most  enjoyable of them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the seventh moment, they are still kissing, and Yuuichi has done nothing of the sort.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  the tenth moment, they part, and Yuuichi grins at her. Mai grins back,  but Yuuichi sees something in his peripheral vision. He turns to look  at the door and sees…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Grinning at him. His grin is  like a knife, but a sheathed one. There is no anger in his eyes; what  Yuuichi sees is only a sort of vague annoyance, one that said to him, <em>you broke the promise, but that’s okay. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai frowned and looked over at where Yuuichi was staring, his face horrified. <em>What is… </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito’s  look scared her as much as it appeared to scare Yuuichi, and she didn’t  know why, but a moment later, he winked at the two of them and jerked  his head backwards. He vanished from sight a second later, and Midori  appeared in view. She spotted them a second after that, and said, her  voice less playful than normal, “Ooh, caught the lovers making out!” A  second later, Chie appeared with her camera phone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What  progressed from there made Mai forget all about the look on Reito’s  face. He even joined in on the teasing that ensued in his very subtle,  gentle way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuuichi didn’t forget, though.</span></p>
<strong>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
</strong>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru had just started to get used to the idea that maybe his luck  hadn’t deserted him after all when he felt something poking at his  back. Something really, really sharp. He froze, taking in the  near-perfect silence around him and wondering how exactly somebody  could be quite so silent in the middle of a forest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Neither of  them moved; whoever it was that had the upper hand on him seemed  content to keep it and leave it undisturbed for the moment. Likewise,  Minoru, a patient man, was content to wait it out. He had a feeling he  wasn’t about to be executed; maybe it was just him, but if he’d wanted  to kill somebody by sneaking up on them, he probably would have done it  already. With a gun. From far, far away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe that was just him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  wasn’t sure how long he and his assailant stood there, but what he was  sure of was that his muscles were going to start to ache soon. He had  just finished straightening up with Nori’s rifle in his good hand,  resting on his bad one so he didn’t have to use it to clutch anything  too tightly, when he had been accosted by this silent assailant with  what could have been, for all he knew, a pointed stick as easily as it  could have been a knife. The trouble with this position was, very  simply, that the rifle was really, really heavy. That was why it had a  bipod, which, ironically enough, only made it heavier right now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two  minutes passed. Three. His bad wrist was starting to throb from the  weight of the rifle. In a passing thought, he reflected upon whether or  not this was what the arthritis that had claimed several good (read:  rival) snipers he’d known was like. If so, he decided, he was more than  happy staying middle-aged for a good, long time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, with  the lactic acid in his muscles threatening to eat its way out of his  skin, he gave in: “Listen,” he said carefully, his voice very, very  gentle. He waited a moment, and nobody stabbed him to death, so he  decided it was all right to continue. “You might be young and spry, but  I’m getting on a little bit in years, and this rifle is really, really  heavy, and I’m about to drop it. The safety is off, and in all  likelihood, it will go off, and then you’re probably going to stab me  out of reflex, presuming you’re young and spry and all that. So, either  put your pointy stick away or let me put this thing down, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Set it down slowly,” Pointy-stick replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  voice was what really startled him the most. But then again, it didn’t,  really. He had heard it before. Had it taken him off-guard then, too?  He couldn’t remember.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Which is pretty sad, since “before” is less than twenty-four hours ago. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was the voice of that ninja that had put him in this mess in the first place— <em>If I could find a plot to put behind a novel that started like that, I could make a lot of money, </em>Minoru  thought—the one who had said only two words, “that’s all,” after she  had finished disarming him. The voice was sort of deep and hoarse, but  it also possessed just a touch of femininity that most men couldn’t  fake even if they tried, which led him to believe that the ninja was a  female.Before, he had thought it was a male, but most of that was due  to his <em>blinding agony </em>as he tried to struggle and curse and  slowly learned that his muscles not only refused to move, but rewarded  him with intense pain as he did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He did what the ninja said, though, and set the rifle down on the ground. <em>Akira, </em>he thought as he did. <em>That was her name. Was it really a </em>her, <em>though? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Probably.  Guys really did have a harder time injecting femininity into their  voices than females did making their voices masculine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As he  straightened up again, he said, “So, are we going to play the ‘let’s  all wait for Minoru to make a sudden move so we can stab him’ game  again? Or are you going to tell me what it is you want before I die of  a heart attack?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He wondered what it was that gave him this kind  of courage a moment after he said it. It certainly wasn’t the knowledge  that he was probably older than Akira; young people with guns and  knives were a lot more resistant to authority than young people without  them, and if you tried to force them to submit by virtue of age anyway,  they were pretty likely to kill you because they didn’t know what else  to do.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That depends on what you have to tell me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru frowned. <em>I’m being interrogated now? </em>“What do you want to know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru’s  breaking point had never been very high; he tended to submit to  interrogation rather than bravely resist. Sure, it meant betraying  somebody who had paid him to do something, but it also meant keeping  his tongue. Which was important.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who are you working for?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  chuckled as he realized he couldn’t really answer that question. “See,  the trouble is, I have no idea what his name is.” And then, because he  couldn’t resist, “I could tell you I work for Scratch-ass, because  that’s what I call him, but I don’t think that will be much help.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oddly enough, Akira didn’t laugh at this. “How were you paid?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Money  wired to my account. I got orders on a radio set that I think you took  off of me back in Goza, but I don’t think monitoring it will help much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. Tell me why.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He seems to be out gunning for my ass at the moment. And by ‘he,’ I mean ‘all his little henchmen.’” Unspoken was the implied, <em>of whom I used to be one. Very recently. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Again, “Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  chuckled. “Actually, because of that guy.” His expression would have  been a lot more useful if he’d had the balls to actually flick his head  in the direction of Nori’s corpse. “The one with the hole in his back  up the hill.” A flicker of understanding in his head, and then, “You  did that, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>There aren’t really a lot of people  that can sneak up on an entrenched sniper, and I’d guess there aren’t  many ninja around here anymore, either. Two plus two equals…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I did.” At least she wasn’t sheepish about it. No use being sheepish about somebody you’d already gutted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that’s why they’re gunning for me. Because of him. The deal was, ‘if  one of you dies, we’ll shoot the other,’ and, well…he’s dead.” <em>four. Except when it doesn’t. </em>Because it didn’t always.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akira didn’t question the logic. She didn’t need to. “Will he send others after you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  paused to consider, but not long. “Probably. And they’ll probably be  doing it exactly the same way this guy watched the cabin down there;  from a long way away, with a big, silent rifle. They don’t know where I  am yet, but I’m willing to bet that they’ll find out soon enough.”  Another flicker of understanding. “And that’s bad. Because those people  in that cabin are your friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akira, <em>my old mark had said, </em>you can come out now. <em>Two plus two… </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akira  said nothing, so Minoru spoke, and did so with even more caution than  when he had been afraid that he was about to be gutted. “If you’re  going after this guy, we could probably help each other out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  planning on fleeing as soon as possible.” Akira didn’t make it a  question, and, unfortunately, she was spot-on. He was grateful, and a  little attracted, to the girl Midori, but he wasn’t <em>bullet-in-my-skull-for-you </em>attracted  to her. He hadn’t actually ever been that taken with any girl. Maybe he  was just smarter than the guys who had taken bullets in their skulls  for girls who were now fucking other men.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru had no idea what  to say. Akira was right, of course: This wasn’t the first deal of his  that had gone sour, and it wouldn’t be the first time he had to  disappear. It didn’t really bother him to have to do that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll warn you now that I have people watching you; people like me.” <em>Were </em>there  more ninja in the Goza area? Was that maybe why the tourism here was so  bad? “If you try to flee before this is settled, you will die. If you  endanger any of my f…those people down there, you will die. Understand?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.” Minoru frowned. Maybe he wasn’t so lucky after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  then again, he wasn’t dead. That by itself was evidence to the  contrary. And maybe this was something he should do, anyway. “I’ll help  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akira said nothing, but Minoru had a feeling she was surprised anyway. He wasn’t really the <em>I’ll help you</em> type. He was more of the <em>holy shit, it’s the pope! </em>and  flee type. But if he was stuck here, and he was going to have people  out gunning for him, wasn’t it better to have the ninjas on his side?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Again, I could make some money with that tagline.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru obviously wasn’t much of a writer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ten  minutes later, Minoru was most of the way back to the cabin, a lot less  comfortable than he’d been half an hour ago when his only worry was a  banged-up wrist. He found that the red-haired girl had been caught  making out with her boyfriend—<em>can’t really blame him, </em>remarked the side of him that he liked to call his <em>I actually </em>do <em>want to go to jail </em>side.  Before he’d gotten to the camp, he’d disassembled the rifle and stored  it in his now obscenely heavy backpack, and as a result had very nearly  broken his neck coming down the steps from the parking lot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  had been planning on telling them that they should maybe clear out for  a little while because there was some trouble going on around him. When  he saw the spectacle that was starting to form mostly around the  orange-haired girl and her boyfriend, he couldn’t. Just couldn’t. Even  worse than that, he had no idea why.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As it turned out, that saved their lives, but he didn’t know that at the time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  only knew, as he stood on the outskirts of their group—behind the  cabin, but a safe distance from the slightly creepy pink-haired girl  sulking fairly miserably in a bush— that for the first time in a very,  very long time, he felt just a little lonely.</span></p>
