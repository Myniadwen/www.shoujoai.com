<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shining  days, burning bright</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">After  burns had been drenched, breakfast consumed, and nightmares  forgotten, the twelve of them settled down on the beach (on towels)  to discuss what they should do for the first day of their spring  break.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  want to go swimming!” Mikoto announced, beginning the forum on a  positive note.  She stood up and tried to make for the ocean before  anybody could agree or disagree, but Natsuki, moving with a speed  born from years of paranoia, stuck her foot out into the younger  girl’s path, tripping her.  Mikoto practically flew to the ground,  but managed to catch herself before she got a faceful of sand.  She  tried again to make for water, only to find Natsuki’s firm grip on  her ankle preventing her from going anywhere but down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’ve  just eaten breakfast,” Natsuki said levelly.  “If you go swimming  now, you’ll drown and I won’t save you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mikoto  made a face and crawled back to her towel.  Mai smiled at the girl.  “Don’t worry, Mikoto.  We’ll have plenty of time to go swimming  after you’ve had time to digest your food.  We could even go  swimming before lunch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Good  idea, Mai.”  Mikoto considered.  “I want lunch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  just ate breakfast, stupid!” Shiho shouted from her position around  Tate’s arm.  “How can you want lunch already?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shiho!”  Tate chided, feeling very much like a parent at that moment.  He was  certainly as embarrassed as one, as the group dissolved into complete  silence, staring at the two of them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  just saying,” Shiho said as though it was an excuse, unaware of the  awkwardness rapidly enveloping the twelve of them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  don’t just say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">In  recent weeks, Shiho had started to drop her <em>cute-girl </em>routine  around the twelve of them.  Maybe it was because they were all aware  of her real disposition and she knew that she wasn’t fooling anyone  anymore, or maybe she was just becoming more comfortable around them,  but in any case, it was so sudden that the group hadn’t really  learned to cope with it yet when she snapped at them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Just  like an embarrassed parent, </em>Mai told herself firmly, trying to  pretend that the prospect didn’t bother her.Still, she  couldn’t help staring at them with a little bit of jealousy.  The  rest of the group found other places to look—at each other, at the  sea, at a small crab that suddenly looked delicious when Mikoto  thought about the miso broth that she had just consumed.  Some broke  off into polite conversation to mask the bickering that was beginning  to envelop Shiho and Tate, the bickering that had been more common  lately.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Natsuki  and Shizuru were seated next to each other, Shizuru talking quietly  at Natsuki, who was barely looking at her, pretending she didn’t  desperately need sleep the way she did.  Pretending, maybe, that she  wasn’t thinking with more than a little bit of…Natsuki might have  been able to call it fear if nobody had ever tried to kill her  before…not wholly pleasant anxiety about the dream that had  rendered her completely sleepless.  In any case, Shizuru didn’t  seem to mind.  She had a small, completely benign grin on her face,  and she was speaking animatedly, in a pleasant voice, which Natsuki  could only half-focus on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“…would  be wonderful to go into the little town that we passed on the way  here.  I saw several arcades, and more than one little karaoke bar.  I’m sure Mai would enjoy that very much; perhaps you might even  have a good time, Natsuki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Natsuki  remained as she was, struggling to stay awake, to avoid embarrassing  herself in front of everybody by collapsing; struggling to avoid  dreaming again. She was starting to realize that the dream was  fundamentally frightening her in ways she hadn’t felt<br />
      <em>wind  blows and the captain of the kendo team</em><br />
  frightened  in a long time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Coming  from anybody else, Shizuru’s constant conversation with what may as  well have been a brick wall might have seemed a little pathetic.  In  her case, however, she simply sounded as though she was speaking to a  close friend on the phone.  “Also, I noticed a couple of fancy  lingerie shops there, and I’m sure that you <em>would love to shop  in them with me, to undress in the booth with me, to not even bother  seeing how well the lingerie fit you because we never bothered trying  them on in the first place my Natsuki </em>would enjoy the chance to  rebuild your collection.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Natsuki’s  attention did a little jump-to.  “<em>What?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shizuru  looked a little surprised.  “I’m sorry, did I embarrass you?  I  forgot that you were private about your collection.” She lowered  her head a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Natsuki  was, but at the moment, that was the last thing that concerned her.  “No, before that.  What did you say before that? Or…” she  struggled for a moment.  “Or in between it.” Her pulse  jackhammered in her chest, and she realized that she was having some  trouble breathing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In  bet…what?”  Shizuru looked confused.  “Are you feeling alright,  Natsuki?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Fine.”   Natsuki dropped her gaze, her pulse dropping back to a normal rate. <em>Did she actually say that? </em>She looked around.  Mai was still  staring at Tate, who was still arguing with Shiho; Aoi and Chie were  talking in low tones about something or other; Reito was looking at  Mai, very much like Mai was looking at Tate.  Mikoto was chasing  after a crayfish.  Kazuya and Akane were cuddling, practically  wiggling with glee. Midori looked a little annoyed, but only because  she seemed to want to speak.  None of them were staring at Shizuru  with the kind of shocked looks she would have attracted by declaring  her intent to strip Natsuki down in a dressing room and fuck her  blind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So,  would you like to go to town with me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shiho  had actually stood up, and she was shouting something about a  “conniving woman” at Tate, though Natsuki had a feeling that she  was using much harsher language than that.  She had a hard time  noticing, staring at the palms of her hands, face beet-red.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">And  suddenly, a voice stopped them all.  Bright, perky, unfazed by  imaginary declarations or very real name-calling, and most of all,  fully confident in herself, Midori stood up, fist clenched, and said,  “That’s it! Lets all go to the town!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They all  stopped what they were doing and stared at her as though she had  informed them that the grand Duke of Earl was actually residing in  her sport coat back in the cabin and she had forgotten to let him out  for water last night.  Even Mikoto, who had finally captured the  crayfish and was presently trying to find a way around its shell,  stopped moving and looked, though she didn’t lose her grip on the  poor thing in her hand.  Only Mai remained doing what she had been  doing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That  town kicks ass!” Midori continued.  “I don’t know if you guys  noticed it, but it’s great! It’s got all sorts of shops, and  restaurants, and…” she locked her gaze on Mai, who didn’t  notice, “the world’s greatest…” a deep breath of anticipation  arose. How could she have forgotten to let the duke out? “<em>ka-ra-OKE!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mai  didn’t look up, and suddenly the group’s attention was on her. <em>This is her </em>thing<em>, dammit, </em>Midori thought. <em>What’s  up with her? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">In  reality, Midori knew damned well what was up with her. She just  wasn’t up to addressing it at the moment.  She hadn’t had a drink  in what felt like a couple billion years. Not since the professor…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She  shook her head, and Mikoto was next to Mai in an instant.  “Mai?  Are you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">What  happened next was a blur for everybody around Mai and Mikoto:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mai’s  gaze lowers to the sand.  A hint of a tear begins to work its way  into her eye.  She doesn’t blink.  She seems to have gone catatonic  for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mikoto’s  lips press against Mai’s ear, and she whispers something.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mai’s  eyes focus immediately, and she shakes her head, as though coming out  of a daze.  Maybe Tate catches on to what happened, and Chie, being  the cleverest of the bunch with regards to the interactions between  human beings, understands immediately, based on what she had been  told about what transpired between Mikoto, Tate, and Mai only a few  months before.  And she had been told <em>everything</em>; not just  about the drama that transpired, but about the cruel, bitter  violence.  About how close they had all come to dying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mai’s  eyes meet Mikoto’s, and for a moment, they just stare at each  other. In Mai’s eyes are all the thanks the world has to offer, and  in Mikoto’s, a simple understanding.  Then Mikoto grins and says,  more to the rest of the group than to Mai, “Mai didn’t sleep well  last night, did you?  You must have nodded off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The rest  have no idea how to take this, except as an explanation.  Even if Mai  hadn’t fallen asleep, she may have fallen into a half-awake state.  Yes, they silently agreed, this would explain her temporarily odd  behavior.  Better that than to force the <em>real </em>issue into light  right now, when none of them were really prepared to deal with it,  least of all Mai.  It sounded a lot more selfish than it actually  was; Chie especially was really equipped to deal with anything,  anytime, but she understood that for now, Mai needed to remain how  she was.  That was how she got through life.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  then, it’s settled by a unanimous vote!” Midori grinned, shoving  the energy back into the group’s face without really asking.  Or  voting.  “Everybody go get something respectable to wear, or at  least something that looks neat coming off,” she winked at Natsuki,  of all people, who blushed a deep, deep red. (even Shizuru, who had  seemed so confident in Natsuki’s imagination a moment ago, looked  away, a little flush in her cheeks.)  “We are going to <em>town!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They all  stood and began going towards the beach house, everyone but Mai and  Mikoto.  In spite of their vicious fight a moment ago, Shiho  automatically latched onto Tate’s arm, and the boy afforded Mai a  glance that looked a lot like…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>pity?<br />
  sympathy?<br />
  something  deeper?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Tate  looked away at Mai’s glance, which more or less instructed him to  do so.  It was the ancient female communiqué: <em>We’ll talk  later. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Then  they vanished, and Mikoto put her arms around Mai, who sank into the  younger girl for a minute.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Are  you okay?” Mikoto asked quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes.  Thank you.” Mai’s voice was a little faint.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Mai  should sleep more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They  sat there for a full minute like that, Mikoto holding Mai, Mai being  held.  Mikoto saying nothing, because she knew there was nothing to  say.  Because she knew that what had been consuming Mai towards the  end had not been some petty angst over the boy that she would  probably “officially” confess to in the next month.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mai had  been thinking about that, about <em>before. </em>About how close  everyone that she loved had come to death.  Permanent, final  nothingness.  Death left a stain on you once you had seen it, felt  it, one that did not come off so easily as Mai had thought it would.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mai  Tokiha was a strong girl; very strong.  But what she had gone through  had left a piece of itself on her, and it didn’t come off quite so  easily as she would have liked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mai had  been staring at Tate, and she had been watching him die again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mikoto  knew this because she herself had killed him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Smiling  Mai is the best Mai there is.  Mai should smile,” Mikoto said for  the second time that day, “because they’re all alive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  know,” Mai whispered, and Mikoto braced for the final wave of pain,  the hardest for Mai.  This was not a new occurrence, and though it  certainly wasn’t common for Mai to break down like this, it had  happened before, and it had always been around Mikoto.  In some  far-off part of her brain, the girl knew that her presence wasn’t  always welcome in Mai’s mind, but this was a thought buried deep  enough not to trouble her.  “Sometimes, I just…I’m scared.” <em>I think about that ever-present </em>what-if<em>; like after you  narrowly miss running face-first into somebody.  Only this one  doesn’t go away. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>This  one won’t ever go away.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  will, Mai,” Mikoto whispered, and Mai, unaware that she had  actually said that out loud, and not really aware of how Mikoto had  responded, gave a single, lone sob.  Mikoto squeezed her again, and,  after a moment, Mai stood up.  There were no tears on her face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Mikoto  looked up at Mai; looked up at the woman she loved so dearly that it  sometimes pervaded all sense of being for her, and in a moment of  clarity, Mai thanked somebody, anybody that Mikoto was still young  enough not to associate that kind of love with being used so  hurtfully as she had been.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Lets  go to town, Mai,” Mikoto grinned.  “You can get some things to  cook.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think I’ll do that,” Mai said.  She sounded better already.  Things like this, Mikoto knew, came and went.  She had her own  spasms, though she would never tell Mai, not in a million years.  It  didn’t usually matter anyway; they came at night, and she slept  with Mai, and that was all the comfort she really needed.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Chie  shook her head a little, gazing at the pair advancing towards the  cabin for a moment as she exited the bathroom, more than a little  relieved.  Mai and Mikoto were walking quickly, grinning at each  other, though Mai’s grin was a little somber, and Mikoto’s a  little exaggerated.  They held hands, fingers interlaced like old  lovers. (Which, Chie knew for a fact, they were not.) <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Those  two...I know there’s a connection between all of the other girls on  this trip, even Shiho; it’s the kind of connection old war buddies  have.  But these two have something even deeper than that.  It’s  like Mikoto is Mai’s daughter or something. </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  knew a lot of things: She knew why a dormitory had suddenly exploded  in a massive fireball last semester; she knew why students began to  go missing towards the end of that semester and why they reappeared <em>at </em>the end; she knew where Kazuya and Akane had been since the  middle of that semester (and she knew where they were now, though she  could have done without—she had seen them sneaking off to the back  of the cabin while everybody else went to change); she knew why the  moon had become, for a short time, a thing of exquisite ugliness, a  massive orb hanging so near to the earth it seemed it would land on  Tokyo, with what looked like pink mold growing off of it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But her  curiosity nagged at her about these two.  She didn’t know what they  had that the rest of the ex-HiME didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chie,”  Aoi’s voice, more than a little hurried, came from the edge of her  peripheral vision, “are you going in or out of the bathroom?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  all depends on where you’re going, sweet thing,” Chie said  automatically, grinning a little impishly as Aoi danced in front of  her, every part of the poor girl’s being silently screaming at Chie  to <em>MOVE I HAVE TO PEE!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  paused to consider, and then shrugged.  “I guess it can’t be  helped if you don’t want me watching you, then.  I have to keep an  eye on those deadly baby-feeders of yours, after all. If they were to  get loose in the building, who knows what kind of hell they could  raise?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chie!”  Aoi went a little redder than was necessary.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine,  fine.”  Chie moved, and if she looked closely, she was even able to  see Aoi as she zipped past her and slammed the door shut.  From her  vantage point, Chie knocked on the door.  “That miso you gulped  getting to you, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was no answer, but Aoi giggled a little. <em>Honestly, </em>Chie  thought. <em>I’m so mean to that girl sometimes, and she puts up  with it so gracefully. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  little voice inside Chie told her that Aoi secretly loved it.  It was  the same voice that usually led her to interesting pieces of gossip  back at Fuka Gakuen.  She referred to that voice as <em>trouble. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai and  Mikoto walked up the stairs next to each other, shed their sandals,  and walked past her into the bedroom where the girls were changing.  On her way by, Chie caught a look from Mai that she couldn’t  interpret fully, but that flicked at her heart a little bit the way a  third grader had once flicked at the back of her head:  Painfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mai,”  Chie said, and the girl stopped.  Mikoto did too, and Mai gave her a  shrug.  Mikoto continued into the bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry about before,” Mai said, averting her eyes from Chie’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Screw  that,” Chie said quietly.  “That thing that’s been eating at  you is what I’m concerned about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  shrugged, and Chie pulled her aside as the door opened and Aoi  exited, giving Chie a look that was both reproachful and a little  amused.  Chie shook her head, and Aoi nodded, kept walking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  serious,” Chie said.  “I don’t know what I can do to force you  to forget about what <em>didn’t happen, </em>but—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  it did happen,” Mai said.  “The rest was just luck.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  it can never happen again,” Chie smiled, putting one cool hand on  Mai’s cheek and raising it so that their eyes met.  “I don’t  know all the details of what happened to you guys, but I do know that  it’s over.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  didn’t say anything, but it was clear she was biting her tongue.  She was in a pretty bad way, Chie thought.  “Listen. I know it’s  hard, but try and have a good time on this trip, okay? If you can’t  forget about it, try at least talking to Tate instead of staring at  him like he’s dead. I think that will serve as a healthy reminder  that he’s not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  do you know? </em>Mai thought bitterly. <em>You weren’t there.  You  didn’t see it.  You didn’t watch him—</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>And  if you keep staring at the ground like that, you might as well just  lie down on it and die. I can help you do that if you want.  Just  pull the trigger and </em>I’ll talk to you any time you need it, but  I think there’s somebody else you need to talk to, and soon.  Stop  pussyfooting around, if you know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  looked up, eyes widening in alarm.  “<em>What did you say?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  blinked.  “What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  Mai shook her head.  “It’s nothing.” <em>That can’t have been  real.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  the shock of it had snapped her out of her stupor.  It had to; for a  second there, she had seen a very real image of Chie doing exactly  what she had said she would do.  Her adrenaline alone had forced her  out of that trance; that fight or flight instinct that had suddenly  screamed at her to <em>run, run, </em>run <em>dammit! </em>She</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>just  pull the trigger and…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">shook  her head.  “Sorry.  I’m better now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  grinned.  “You just stay that way.  If you’re not, just come talk  to old Aunt Chie and I’ll perk you right up.  Maybe I can even  impose on Midori for some of her better booze.  A <em>real </em>girls  night out, if you know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai had  a feeling that what she knew Chie meant was a great deal more  perverted than what Chie had intended when she said it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  grinned at her anyway, feeling the girl’s sincerity press down on  her heart in the best way.  “So, when are we going to town?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  looked at Mai in her swimsuit, which exposed a great deal more than a  modest girl like Mai would normally want to show a stranger. She  expected Mai had bought it with Tate in mind.  “If you want to show  half the town your tits, then right now; I certainly won’t mind, and I’m  sure they won’t, eith—”  But Mai had already gone beet-red,  having previously forgotten about her current manner of dress, and bolted for the  bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chie  grinned at the retreating girl’s back for a moment, and then went  out in search of Aoi, and maybe a few incriminating photographs of  Kazuya and Akane to pester them with.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Maybe if  Minoru hadn’t been lying in a pile of grass on his stomach,  watching the show through the scope of a sniper rifle, he would have  enjoyed the sight of eight or nine high-school girls changing. As it  was, the cramp in his back was already pretty bad and he was more  pissed-off than anything.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All they  were doing was changing; it seemed like the orange-haired one with  the big breasts was angsting over some guy or another (he rolled his  eyes, having been and gone from his angsty lone-sniper days), and the  girl who was so shitheeled over the skinny guy was in back making out  with him. Was this really what he was getting paid to do?  And why  wasn’t his target doing anything interesting, like shouting  inspirational, if radical, speeches at a bunch of bright-eyed  soldiers, or killing fifty men with five shots, or something that was  actually worth his fucking <em>time? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Okay, so  he got cabin fever sometimes.  It didn’t make him a bad sniper.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  else about the whole thing was making him antsy.  That was the  problem.  A palpable sense of <em>wrong-ness </em>about the whole  thing.  He was sure that at least one of the girls—the one with the  long, purple hair who always seemed to have another one fawning over  her (<em>kids these days</em>, an old homophobe thought)—had caught  onto it too.  He was also almost certain it had something to do with  what he was doing, which meant trouble.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A few  minutes later, they all began to pile into the van, and it occurred  to Minoru that this facilitated a new part of his assignment.  He  picked up the two-way radio that connected him to scratch-ass, and  after a moment’s hesitation, clicked the button.  “Boss, they’re  leaving.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You </em>know? <em>Then what the fuck am I here for? </em>Minoru was  suddenly angry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Orders?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Follow  them, of course. They’ll be heading into the town.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Follow…what? </em>“On foot?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course on foot.  Make sure nobody sees your rifle. Your partner will  remain here and observe the premises.  The town is less than a  quarter-mile away from your current position, and it is small enough  that they should stand out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  sighed with the button depressed so that the bastard couldn’t hear  him, but he got the strangest feeling he could anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  pressed the button again.  “Roger that.  Moving on foot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  prospect of trekking <em>any </em>length again in this heat didn’t  appeal to him at all.  The fact that he would look like a complete  jackass in his hiking attire didn’t sweeten the deal, either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  hear that, good buddy?” he said into his other radio, the one  linking him to his partner.  “I’ll be leaving you here by  yourself for a while.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Roger  that.” Flat, uncaring.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Make  sure you don’t die of boredom or anything.  I wouldn’t want that  creepy bastard after me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Roger  that.” Flat, uncaring.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>God,  how boring. </em></span></p>

The man  with the scratchy voice put the radio down, satisfied for the moment. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No matter how much he gripes, he won’t lose them. And the longer  he follows my orders, the longer the paper trail gets, and the closer  I come to cutting it off. </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  supposed this was what real criminals felt like when they found what  they considered to be the perfect crime.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But then  again, he wasn’t even close to being a criminal.  Not in his mind,  anyway.</span></p>
