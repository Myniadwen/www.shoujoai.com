<h1>Fifth Anniversary</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Yukino
Today is the fifth anniversary of the day Haruka and I declared our love 
for each other.  I&#39;ve made it a point to keep very accurate count (and 
by about 5:30 this evening, it&#39;ll have been five years to the very 
moment), because on that day and on that moment, both our lives changed.  
Today is special because it marks that turning point in our lives:  
one-thousand, eight-hundred twenty-six days exactly since we first 
shared our love (including that funny little &quot;Leap Year&quot; day when Haruka 
dedicated a song on the radio just for me).  
      I can&#39;t help but look back at our history, and think about all the 
things we&#39;ve experienced.  I&#39;d like to say that every moment was more 
precious and happy than the last, but there were times when Haruka and I 
were both miserable.  Perhaps I should go over those times as well, if 
only to justly reflect on the good and bad.  It wouldn&#39;t be fair if I 
only remembered the times I enjoyed.  Luckily for me, though, these days 
were prevailing, and the times of sadness were very few.

Haruka
Five years together!  Has it really been that long?  Time really does 
fly, doesn&#39;t it?  But it hasn&#39;t been all wine and posies!

Yukino
Don&#39;t you mean &quot;roses&quot;, Haruka?

Haruka
But I gave you posies on that day; I thought you&#39;d remember...

Yukino
Oh, that&#39;s right, I&#39;m sorry.  Yes, you&#39;re right; you gave me those 
flowers as a gift because you wanted it to be special.  I still remember 
how giddy I was when I got them.  I can&#39;t believe you grew them 
yourself!

Haruka
Well, I did say that I wanted to give you a living symbol of my love for 
you.  So what&#39;s this about reflecting on our history?  Are we taking a 
look back to see all the strange and wonderful times we&#39;ve had?  I just 
want to put in my two yen&#39;s worth before you do, and comment on what we 
did on our third anniversary!  In my opinion, that was more special than 
any other day we&#39;ve celebrated.
	Statistics show that most couples, whether they just stay where 
they are or if they get married, usually get tired of one another and 
break everything off around their third year.  Marriages will especially 
reach their disastrous peak at this time, and most divorces happen 
because of it.  About several months before we hit this monumental 
number, I told Yukino what I felt about it.  I was...frankly a little 
worried, and even silly about it.  I reaffirmed my feelings again and 
again, and I did so many nice things for her that...I&#39;m afraid my plan 
backfired a little.  I think I smothered her too much with affections.  
But I&#39;ve known her all of my life; I didn&#39;t want to lose her just 
because of a number.  I was in super stitches...and scared.

Yukino
I think you mean &quot;superstitious&quot;.

Haruka
We fought several times during our relationship because of that little 
exchange.  I&#39;d say one thing and Yukino would correct me.  Normally I&#39;d 
let it slide, and a few times I even thought it was a sweet gesture.  
But darn it, sometimes I mean what I say, and I don&#39;t like it when 
people correct my meaning!  If I meant it, Yukino, then I meant it!

Yukino
But we never let the fights get out of hand.  We&#39;d go our separate paths 
and come back together once we started to miss each other, and nearly 
every time afterwards, we just laughed about it.  We fought over the 
silliest things, didn&#39;t we Haruka?

Haruka
I&#39;m actually surprised you argued with me about something.  You&#39;re 
usually so subservient; it really took me off guard.  Ha!  I must&#39;ve 
looked strange standing there, gawking at you.  &quot;No, Haruka, you&#39;re 
wrong,&quot; you said-the first time you defied me.  Yukino, no matter what 
you believe or what you heard me say, I want you to know that when you 
did that, I fell even deeper in love with you.  You were becoming a 
strong, independent woman before my eyes, and I was afraid and happy and 
doubtful and angry all at once.  My own best friend drops a bombshell on 
me and I never see it coming.

Yukino
Which only goes to show how much more we have to learn from each other.  
But that&#39;s all right:  we&#39;ve made it up to this point in our lives, and 
we&#39;re not quitting now.  Oh, and Haruka, while it&#39;s still fresh on my 
mind, I want to apologize for anything that might&#39;ve hurt you back 
then-on our third anniversary, I mean.

Haruka
Yukino, you know you don&#39;t need to keep doing that.  We forgave each 
other and laughed it off-and here we are, two years later and closer 
than ever!  I&#39;d call that a victory!

......

Yukino
How it all began?  That&#39;s...a little personal.  But maybe I should tell 
you, since I was really the one who started it.

Haruka
And was I surprised to hear her just blurt it all out, especially after 
the way I treated Shizuru!  Uh...oops, did I interrupt?  Sorry, you go 
ahead and tell the story.

Yukino
Thanks, Haruka.  Well, it&#39;s a pretty long and detailed story, and you&#39;d 
have to go back at least a decade earlier to really understand it.  The 
gist of it is that not too long after the &quot;Hime Festival&quot;, when the fog 
was clearing and the dust was settling, I pulled Haruka aside and asked 
to speak with her.

Haruka
Only after bawling your eyes out.  Oh-I&#39;m interfering again.  Sorry!

Yukino
It&#39;s okay.  And yes, I&#39;m not ashamed to say that I cried.  Some days I 
still cry, but for different reasons.  Anyway, after I had cleared up 
and found my voice again, I looked at Haruka in the eyes and took my 
glasses off.  Normally the entire world is blurry without them, but for 
a few short seconds, my face so close to hers, I could see clearly 
again.  My path was set before me, staring back with strength and love 
and undying patience, and it was up to me to take the first step.  The 
first ones were small, I&#39;ll admit, but still in the right direction.
	&quot;I really...care for you, Haruka,&quot; I said, holding her shoulders 
in my trembling hands.  Heh...I&#39;m embarrassed to be saying this again 
after such a long time.  Well, I ended up saying the same thing over and 
over again-about how I cherished her more than anything, and...well, how 
I would&#39;ve done anything to keep her safe.  Yeah, meek little Yukino, 
acting as her best friend&#39;s bodyguard, when we all know which one of us 
is stronger.

Haruka
Yukino...that&#39;s not true.  I would never have given you the time of day 
if I thought you were weak.  You&#39;re one of the toughest people I know, 
and I know a lot of tough people!

Yukino
Thanks, Haruka.  Moving on, I sort of lost myself then.  I remembered 
how repulsed Haruka was with Miss Fujino, and her words came back to 
haunt me.  I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever really get across to her without 
spoiling what we already had.  I was nearly ready to give up, but she 
stopped me.  Then, she showed me something.

Haruka and Yukino
The Fuka Student Council Armband.

Yukino
That&#39;s right.  &quot;This is our bond, Yukino,&quot; she said to me, &quot;and no 
matter what happens between us, you know that this will hold us 
together.&quot;  With her words giving me strength, I looked directly into 
her face, felt my spine become firm, and told her that I loved her.  &quot;I 
love you, Haruka.  That&#39;s really all I wanted to say.  I always have, 
and I always will.&quot;  I really didn&#39;t know what else to say, so I&#39;m glad 
I kept it simple.  I was so scared...and yet I was relieved too, because 
at last I had crossed that line, and now there were no secrets left 
between us.

Haruka
Well, except for the whole Hime thing, but we covered that later.  
Anyway, after Yukino told me, I sort of froze right there.  I remembered 
what I said to Shizuru as well, and I actually felt a little bad for 
Yukino, who had overheard the entire thing.  No matter what she did or 
what she said, Yukino was my one and only true friend, my most precious 
thing in this world.  I saw her crying and embraced her; it seemed like 
the right thing to do at the time.  We stayed quiet and close for...oh, 
goodness knows how long.  Eventually, I could feel her pulse beating 
against my own.  Maybe listening to Yukino&#39;s heartbeat was enough to 
convince me:  I honestly and truly did love this girl.  I&#39;m such a 
hypocrite.

Yukino
You did say afterwards that you understood Miss Fujino&#39;s point of view, 
and why she did the things she did.  The two of you really are similar.

Haruka
I wouldn&#39;t go that far, Yukino.  I still don&#39;t like her!  But at least I 
understand her now.  I probably would&#39;ve done the same things if you 
were in danger.  I would fight to the very last drop of my blood, 
Yukino-because I love you too, so fully and completely.  Once we got 
over that obstacle, we kissed for the first time-or rather, I kissed 
you.

Yukino
I definitely didn&#39;t expect it, but it was a very welcome gesture!  
Everything seemed to make sense to me after that moment, and we&#39;ve 
slowly and gradually built up from there ever since, until here we are, 
five years later, with enough experiences to fill a novel.

Haruka
How about we talk about that time during the senior prom?  I really 
enjoyed that.  It was the first time I really showed any signs of public 
infection towards you.

Yukino
I&#39;m not sure if holding hands counts, Haruka.  And don&#39;t you mean 
&quot;public affection&quot;?

Haruka
See, what would I ever do without you, Yukino?  I mean, seriously!  I&#39;m 
nothing without this girl.

Yukino
You told me that when we first...well, you know.  When we...did that.  
You told me you were nothing without me.  You told me so many things 
that made me cry and want to hold you, Haruka.  I lost count of the 
kisses we shared.

Haruka
We made love, Yukino.  Say it.  There&#39;s no shame in it.  I know I don&#39;t 
have any.  I&#39;m happy to say it!

Yukino
I just think we shouldn&#39;t let our personal lives interfere...

Haruka
All right, then I&#39;m going to tell about the time we first made love!

Yukino
Haruka, is that really necessary?

Haruka
Of course it is, Yukino!  It was a pivotal point in our relationship, 
the moment when our two souls became one...the moment I gave myself over 
to you completely, and when you became mine.  It was so awkward, though!  
We couldn&#39;t stop laughing.  We had no idea what we were doing back then.  
But we loved each other, and we had fun, and we learned a whole lot.  
But Yukino still doesn&#39;t know how to remove my bra properly!

Yukino
HARUKA!!!

Haruka
Sorry, heheh.  I&#39;m really sorry.  Maybe I should just describe the 
events that led up to it.

Yukino
Haruka, must you?

Haruka
Well, this whole recollection was your idea, wasn&#39;t it?  Anyway, it was 
after we graduated, so it&#39;s not like we were doing it before we turned 
eighteen.  Yukino and I were just going to this little dance out of 
town, and we stayed overnight at a hotel my father owned stock in.  Boy, 
if he ever found out what we did there...

Yukino
They did eventually figure it out, Haruka&#39;s parents and mine.  At least 
my mother and father were understanding, probably because...they already 
knew.  But Haruka&#39;s...

Haruka
I was only cut out of the family fortune, no big deal.  It wasn&#39;t like I 
was disowned or anything; mother and father just left me out of their 
wills.  Ha, what a bunch of idiots!  Little did they know that I 
would&#39;ve surrendered the world for Yukino!  Hahahahahaaa!!!

Yukino
Umm...haha, that&#39;s Haruka, all right.  And yes, we did share ourselves 
that night, and I&#39;m sorry if I was awkward with your undergarments.  It 
was my first time.

Haruka
It was for the both of us.  I&#39;m just sorry I slept in so late.  I can&#39;t 
believe how much energy I burned up!  How were you able to get up so 
early, Yukino?  You were as animus as I was!

Yukino
Umm...I was...well...  Wait, don&#39;t you mean &quot;amorous&quot;?

Haruka
Actualy...  Never mind.  We can finally change subject now, so let&#39;s go 
ahead and do that.  I&#39;d like to review several of our worst fights, if 
that&#39;s all right with you.

Yukino
We definitely should.  Let&#39;s start with the &quot;college fight&quot;.  I was 
accepted at one place and you were accepted at another.  We cried a 
little and had a spat, which eventually turned into all-out arguing.  
That was during our third year, if I remember correctly.

Haruka
Yeah, ironic, huh?  After everything I did, too.  We knew we couldn&#39;t 
separate because it would kill us, and long-term relationships never 
really work out.  But I wanted Yukino to have every opportunity she 
could, and...my parents also gave me that old tomato.

Yukino
I think you mean &quot;ultimatum&quot;.  I had to enroll at a local college 
because of it.  I caved in, and Haruka got mad.  We spent several days 
apart from each other so we could cool off, then ran into each other by 
accident in the park.  We just laid down in the grass and stared up at 
the sky, trying to pierce the blue ceiling and our own mounting 
problems.  Haruka, I can never forget how warm your hand was that day, 
or how soft your smile...

Haruka
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay, Yukino,&quot; I said-I remember it word for word.  &quot;We both 
have our whole lives ahead of us.  If this is really the path you want 
to take, then I&#39;ll stand by your side all the way.  Once I&#39;m finished 
with this school, we can move away so you can go to that other one.  
You&#39;re much smarter than I am anyway, and can probably get two degrees.  
I&#39;ll be lucky if I pass my first semester.&quot;  Then I smiled at you, and 
drew you near me, whispering my apologies and love.  And that&#39;s what we 
ended up doing, and are still doing even now.  It&#39;s worked out pretty 
good so far, hasn&#39;t it?

Yukino
Yes, it has.  You could almost say that we fought over nothing.

Haruka
Ehh, not quite.  It was a learning experience.  Besides, the idea of 
&quot;kiss and make up&quot; has never been used so liberally!

Yukino
Haruka...I really think you mean &quot;literally&quot;.  Well...it could be both!  
Heheheh!

.........

Haruka
Can you really believe it&#39;s been over 1800 days since we first told each 
other of our love?  I still remember that first kiss.  I couldn&#39;t 
believe I was doing it!  I wanted to smack myself for being so stupid 
about it.  Kissing a girl, and my own best friend, too!  Yukino, I&#39;ve 
never told you this before, but I felt sick and awful those first few 
days.  Sometimes I wanted to rip out all my hair and scream.  Other 
times...I really wanted you to hold me.  I wanted to kiss you.  I wanted 
to see you smile at me.  I was a woman of two minds!

Yukino
But why did you feel so bad?  You didn&#39;t...

Haruka
No, Yukino, I definitely felt love for you.  But it was the same old 
predictable conflict.  I had never given any of it any thought 
before-kissing girls and falling for girls-and the whole thing disgusted 
me.  But you want to know my opinion?  Maybe...the whole thing made me 
sick because, deep down, none of it felt right.  I probably knew, even 
then, that there would never be anybody else but you in my life.  Being 
with other people, boys or girls, was something I didn&#39;t want to face.  
Being with you, Yukino my love, was something I cherished.  Once I 
realized this, I came back to you, with no more doubts caked around my 
heart.  I was cleansed and clear and ready to start my new life with 
you!

Yukino
Haruka...!  I do love you, Haruka.  Well, let&#39;s see, what else should we 
dredge up?  Some moments are just too funny for words.  Remember the 
time we were in your school play together?

Haruka
Trying not to, babe.

Yukino
Or when you tried out for that baseball team?

Haruka
Ugh, I&#39;ll never look at a Louisville Slugger the same way again.

Yukino
And...that time...the food-fight in my college cafeteria...your face 
covered in pie!

Haruka
Which I seem to recall you throwing at me, Yukino!

Yukino
C&#39;mon, Haruka, I was just having fun.  And you threw a pie my way too.

Haruka
Yeah.  Then I wrestled you to the ground and kissed you.  Nobody 
noticed!  We were so blazing back then!

Yukino
Don&#39;t you mean &quot;brazen&quot;?

Haruka
I know what I said.  Ahh, it was the glorious period between our shaky 
beginnings and our steady present days.  Yukino, I never want our 
relationship to get dull.  I always want it to be one adventure after 
another!

Yukino
All right, but not too many, or I&#39;ll never be able to catch up.  
Speaking of adventures, do you remember what we did for our first 
anniversary?  Do you remember the fishing trip?  That was...really 
special.  We went out on your father&#39;s yacht, just the two of us, geared 
up and ready to go.  We had no idea what we were doing, but it was fun.  
And then...you fell in, and I was so terrified.  I had no idea you 
couldn&#39;t swim; you always seemed so at ease in Fuka&#39;s pool.  Anyway, I 
dove in without even thinking, and dragged you back to the boat.  To 
this day, I swear you pulled that stunt just to have me perform CPR on 
you!

Haruka
I did not, Yukino!  I was really drowning!

Yukino
Sure you were, Haruka.  I saw how you smiled at me when I &quot;saved&quot; you!

Haruka
That&#39;s because I was overcome with thanks and happiness!  And...I was 
looking into the eyes of my hero, the girl I was in love with.  Do you 
remember what happened later on, that night?

Yukino
Mm-hmm, we roasted marshmallows and sat next to a campfire, just the two 
of us.  We looked at the sky, littered with stars, and made up 
constellations all on our own.  We slept so peacefully that night!

Haruka
Yeah, and the next day, we went skinny-dipping!

Yukino
It&#39;s true, I&#39;ll admit it.  You never told me about your appendectomy.  
That scar of yours startled me.

Haruka
Well, I didn&#39;t think it was important.  And besides, it happened that 
one year you and I were apart from each other.  Yukino, did you know?  I 
felt so cold and empty that time, and when I went on the operating 
table, my only thought was of you.  I wished you were there for me, and 
deep in my mind, I imagined you were, in spirit, smiling at me as 
always, our hands clasped, bracing for the unknown.

Yukino
Haruka...

Haruka
You&#39;re my hero, Yukino-my lifeline, my soulmate, my lover and dearest 
friend.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart, for everything.

Yukino
Haruka...

......

Yukino
Well, it&#39;s now officially been exactly five years since we first shared 
our feelings.  I&#39;ve now had my best friend Haruka as a girlfriend for 
one-thousand, eight-hundred twenty-six days, which is hardly enough time 
to enjoy her company.  I could live a million lives and never have 
enough.  Even eternity is too short a period.

Haruka
Settle down, Yukino!  Let&#39;s not get into metaphysical starry-eyed 
declarations of passion just yet!  Save those for tonight!  I&#39;d like to 
cover graduation day first!

Yukino
You gave a speech in front of the entire school.  I had never been so 
proud of you.  I&#39;m glad you wedged me into it, but it wasn&#39;t necessary.

Haruka
You were the first person I thanked, Yukino!  I know you remember.  Who 
else stood by my side while all of Fuka was in chaos?  Who else worked 
her fingers to the bone for my crazy campaigns and schemes?  Who 
else...held me at night while I wept, and kissed me when I was lonely, 
and smiled at me when I was sad?  Who else kept me on the right path, 
lovingly rebuking me when I strayed, and supporting me when I came 
through?  All that and more is why I finally decided to become yours, to 
return your feelings, and to care for your heart, your beautiful 
priceless heart.  I fell in love with you because...you were my abiding 
light, Yukino.

Yukino
Haruka, I thought you said we wouldn&#39;t get into declarations of passion 
today.  And don&#39;t you mean &quot;guiding&quot; light?

Haruka
They both work pretty well.

Yukino
Oh, you&#39;re right.  Sorry about that.

Haruka
It&#39;s all right.  That&#39;s just something about you I love.  Well, happy 
anniversary, Yukino.  Here&#39;s to five wonderful years behind us, and many 
more ahead.

Yukino
Yes.  May each one follow the other to give us love, courage, strength, 
and new insight.  May we be together for all our lives, and when those 
fade away, may our souls take their rightful place in the universe, and 
guide us into the next world.  I pray, Haruka, that if we are reborn, 
our carnations find each other once more.

Haruka
Yukino?

Yukino
Yes, my love?

Haruka
Don&#39;t you mean...reincarnations?

Yukino
Oh...I guess I do.  Thanks, Haruka!

Haruka
No problem!
