<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So I  dub thee unforgiven</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Unforgiven</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  “toast” between Shizuru and Reito lasted only a moment, but a  silence which seemed to emanate directly from it lasted much longer.  Uncertain and yet strangely peaceful, the silence danced coyly  between awkward and comfortable with the fluid grace of an acrobat;  at least, this was how Shizuru observed it.  She thought that perhaps  Reito might agree with her, but at the same time, she couldn’t be  certain that Reito was paying any attention to the silence that had  appeared so suddenly.  Perhaps he <em>was, </em>in fact, simply  studying the floorboards as he sat comfortably on his calves with his  head bowed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Or  maybe he has other places—other people—on his mind.  He can  hardly be blamed for that. </em>But Shizuru knew that wasn’t right  either; even when he was knee-deep in an endeavor, Reito was always  adept at focusing on whatever was directly in front of him, to the  exclusion of all else if necessary.  It was the mark of a man  possessed of extraordinary discretion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  actuality, the silence between them, Shizuru realized, was nothing  more than Reito waiting for her to speak. Anything he said at this  point would be utterly pointless until he had something to speak to  her <em>about; </em>so he waited. <em>Discretion. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So  Shizuru pondered what precisely she wanted to say.  She had been the  one to direct them inside the cabin like this, but now she wasn’t  entirely sure what she had done it for.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>To  talk to Reito.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>To  talk to him about what? About me? About Natsuki? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Why  would I invite Reito in here to talk to him about myself? It seems to  me like Reito would sooner talk about himself than me, and he has  never talked about himself to me.  Or, really, to anyone. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  little niggle in the back of Shizuru’s head, cold and impassive,  said,<em> And who does </em>that <em>remind you of? </em>The voice was  gentle and soft-spoken, much like Shizuru herself, but it possessed a  slightly more graceful, groomed quality to it than Shizuru’s. <em>Isn’t  this the same thing that happens every time you try to talk? You  float around each other like matching ballet dancers with matching  butcher’s knives.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru,  however, didn’t need her mother’s voice to tell her that she and  Reito would not be a well-matched pair of lovers. Not now, not from  the woman who, less than three weeks ago, had said to her face  precisely the opposite.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Perhaps  it was the appearance of her mother’s voice that spurred her mouth  into action.  Maybe it was that little rebellious tick in the very  back of her head, the one that is possessed by every child to some  degree or another.  The one that Shizuru’s mother, and then Shizuru  herself, had squashed mercilessly at every corner, <em>as should be  done with every child of good breeding.<br />
  good  breeding.<br />
  fuck  you and your</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  much do you remember from the HiME carnival?” Shizuru said, and  then placed that little tick in her head back inside its box.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  had been prepared for any number of conversational topics from  Shizuru; from the weather, to what sort of tea he preferred, to his  feelings on her potentially devastating, possibly one-sided,  absolutely forbidden romance with Natsuki Kuga.  What he had not been  prepared for was a question about himself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Specifically,  not about<br />
      <em>him</em><br />
  that.  That <em>thing </em>that had been<br />
  <em>yourself</em><br />
  in  his head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So if it  was possible to take Reito off-guard, Shizuru had done it with her  question.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  now you have to answer, which means you have to decide what exactly  the answer is.</em> Easier said than done.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So Reito  spoke slowly, for fear of tripping up and saying something <em>(about  how conscious you actually were)</em>that he didn’t want to say.  “I remember some things. More from earlier in the year, before  …before whatever happened started to really happen.”  It was a  nice euphemism for <em>before everybody started killing each other</em>,really.  “I saw outside of myself more than I saw inside of  myself most of the time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The edge  of Shizuru’s lip curled in to a frown, but she said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  saw outside of yourself because that …thing didn’t keep you  locked up inside of yourself.  He kept you in a box in his pocket.  But he kept the key to the box, too. </em>“I caught snippets here  and there of the things that were happening to you. I knew who died,  and when they died.” <em>And you knew how they died, and how many of  their deaths </em>you <em>ordered. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  was obviously trying for Reito, Shizuru thought. <em>It’s also not  fair.  Get on with your point.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do  you remember how I died?” <em>It feels strange to say that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Of  course it would.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  much of it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Enough  to remember watching you vanishing in Natsuki’s arms, and enough to  remember screaming for the first time inside that cage. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rather  than saying all of this, Reito forced a smile onto his face, pulling  his mood forcefully out of the valley it was threatening to slip  into.  “Enough to know that it’s a bit too unpleasant for a  conversation over tea, don’t you think?” Completely out of habit,  he reached down in front of him for his teacup, craving a sip of  something to relax him. <em>And lacking anything stronger.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was, of course, nothing in front of him, so his hand grasped nothing  but air; confused, his hand attempted to grasp the teacup again,  unable to pick up on that there <em>was </em>no teacup there; they were <em>not </em>having conversation over tea, and there <em>was </em>no  subject too unpleasant for them to speak on. There were only the  subjects too painful to think about; the kind that made Reito want to  shake his head in frustration every time he did.  Shake it and shake  it and shake it until his head was clear and</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>the  cage </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">his  thoughts went away or his neck snapped and he didn’t have to worry  about a goddamn thing anymore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  frowned at Reito, who shook his head for a moment, sharp and violent,  seemingly without warning; it wasn’t an atypical action for a  normal person.  A normal person might be thinking of something  unpleasant or especially nagging, and a little burst of wind about  the ears might help jolt them to their right minds.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  was different, though.  Of all of the people Shizuru had met, all of  the little insignificant people that she had smiled at, shaken hands  with, greeted formally; all of the people that her mother had told  her about, introduced her to, and even—sometimes less subtly than  others—forced her to court; of all of these people, Reito was the  most controlled.  The most self-contained, self-sufficient,  self-reliant. The only one who never, <em>ever </em>slipped.  Even  Shizuru could slip</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>and  fall on someone else’s head</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">now and  again. Once in recent memory.  Perhaps twice more if she dug back  deep enough.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not  Reito.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not  ever.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And yet  here he was, doing just that. Slipping. What did that mean? Had  something disturbed him, hurt him, fazed him that badly? What could  possibly—</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  believe we were talking about you, in any case.”  Reito’s voice  did what it so often did, and interrupted her thoughts just before  they went off of the deep end.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Were  we?” Shizuru said less coldly than she had, perhaps, intended.  “I  was under the impression that we were here for tea.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  believe that the tea must be postponed for the time being,” Reito  said.  “While I would never, by my own devices, miss out on a  chance to sample your delicious tea, I would prefer that we not use  the place in which we plan to sleep as tinder with which to prepare  it.” His voice was formal, teasing; it was as it usually was. He  had regained himself, something which Shizuru had yet to do.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  nodded pleasantly at him, allowing herself to regress into formality  alongside of his own.  As she did this, she realized for the first  time in a very long time, by the pangs in her stomach and the  niggling at the back of her head, that this bothered her; that she <em>wanted </em>to talk to Reito and that by doing this, by dropping  back into the old routines, she was cutting off that chance. The  wonderful and terrible thing about formality and politeness is that  you could use it to speak volumes to a single person, a crowded  auditorium, or any group in between, and not actually <em>say </em>a  single thing to them.  And not one of them might notice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So, for  the first time in a long time, Shizuru spoke to Reito directly.  “No.   I don’t want to go back to that. I would like to talk to you; I’m  sorry for acting stubborn.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Still,  no reaction from Reito, but Shizuru could tell she had fazed him  anyway.  Maybe it was the lack of an immediate, clever riposte; maybe  it was the eye contact he made.  It was something; she had surprised  and disarmed him, and it felt<br />
      <em>damn  good</em><br />
  different.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly,  Reito smiled. “All right, then. What would you like to talk about?”  The infernal question; that one, impossible, irrefutable question. <em>What would you like to talk about?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Well,  if I knew that, I’d have begun talking about it already, wouldn’t  I have?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  it’s still a perfectly valid question.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Natsuki.”  It came out as she considered this infernal question, apparently not  so diabolical after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  about her?” Reito asked his question as all great speakers asked  their questions: Fully aware of the answer, yet possessed of an  attitude that suggested precisely the opposite. Sometimes that was  what confused people really needed; not deep, sentimental questions,  but somebody who would simply ask them about what they <em>thought </em>they already knew. This was something Reito understood better  than most. “What about Natsuki do you need to talk about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That  I’m in…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is  it that you’re in love with her? Is that it, or is there more to it  than that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Of  course there’s more to it than that.  How could you even think…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There  is,” Shizuru said calmly, not understanding where Reito was going  and not entirely willing to go along with him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is  there?” Reito asked.  “Is there anything more that you could add  to that statement that wouldn’t fall into the realm of romantic  hyperbolae?”  Reito allowed Shizuru about three seconds to answer,  and then continued, “<em>should </em>there be anything more you can  add to that? Should you really have to say anything more than, <em>I  love you, Natsuki</em>?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another  moment, and Reito smiled at her with that irritating, infuriating,  amazing little knowing smile of his.  “Doesn’t anything more than  that tread a little close to obsession, Shizuru?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Obsession  is a dangerous thing, Shizuru.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  finally remembered who had said that to her: It had been Reito. How  could she have not remembered that?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Because  I wanted to forget it. Because I had wanted to ignore that person.  I  had wanted to ignore Reito, and he let me, because he knew it  wouldn’t do any good to press the issue, not back then. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Will  it now?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course,” she said calmly, her hand desperately demanding a teacup  to clutch, her lips craving a taste of the hot drink to calm them.  To allow her some degree of<br />
      <em>escape</em><br />
  certainty.   “You’re right.  Of course you are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  nodded at her, his sharp eyes watching her as carefully as a  psychologist’s.  Or a police interrogator’s. The trouble was, he  didn’t know where to go from here. She had said it, and that alone  would have earned him his day’s wages <em>had </em>he been a  psychologist or an interrogator, but he was neither, and he was  getting no wages out of this.  She had said it, and maybe she had  even believed it, but that meant nothing if it didn’t help her, and  hammering the point home would get him nowhere.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What he  had to do now was wait for Shizuru.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  didn’t have to wait long.  “I’m sorry,” she said in the only  tone of voice she was capable of apologizing sincerely in: A quiet  one.  “You’ve told me this once before, and I ignored you.  I’m  sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  surprised Reito, but not nearly as much as the rest of the day would  surprise him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He stood  and grinned down at her, offering her his hand. “Apology accepted,”  he said cheerfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  looked up at him for a moment, not entirely sure how to feel about  this, and then took the hand and allowed him to help her up.  A  gentleman’s move, with a gentleman’s touch; he did not jerk her  into himself, nor did he simply use his hand as a rope, but rather,  he pulled as much as she did, allowing her to stand up gracefully,  and with a minimum amount of effort.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you,” she said quietly—again, the only way she knew how to be  this sincere with a man. Perhaps it was simply the only way to be  sincere with a man like Reito. <em>I’ll probably never know for  sure.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  exited before her, primarily because he actually had someplace he  wanted to be, but also because he knew she wanted a bit of time to  think.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  would find out later that day just how close to the truth this  thought of hers was. One of the effects of this would be that she  would forevermore hesitate to use the word <em>never.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This was  probably wise.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Midori  was waiting for Reito as he exited the cabin.  Her face was dead-set  and calm, as was Reito’s, though his step revealed as much of his  grin as his face could.  Her sudden appearance didn’t seem to faze  Reito, though he was, indeed, surprised. He didn’t say anything; it  wasn’t polite to ask a lady what it was that she was doing  somewhere; a lady would make it known without any help.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Ah,  the age of the liberated gentlemen, gently pushed into being by the  liberated women of the day.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  couldn’t get a word out of Natsuki, so I figured I’d try Shizuru  instead,” Midori said.  “Neither of them have said more than a  couple words since we got back from Goza, to each other or anybody  else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  you were, naturally, worried about them, were you?” Reito didn’t  believe it for more than a couple instants, but he did give Midori  credit for those instants.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  was.” Her voice was genuine, as were her eyes.<em> Perhaps Midori  deserves more credit than I give her.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or  perhaps, something Reito had yet to consider, he simply gave himself  too much credit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  inside,” Reito said, acknowledging Midori’s victory by not saying  anything about it whatsoever. “Though I believe she needs privacy  right now more than she needs a teacher.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  nice that you believe that,” Midori snapped without meaning to.  “But you’re not her teacher.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Neither  are you.”  Reito hadn’t been defensive in a long time, but he was  now, and he had no real idea why. “She goes to a university now,  which makes you her upperclassman.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Which  affords me about twice the<em> teaching </em>privilege that it affords  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Why  are you so angry?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito,  taken aback by Midori’s harshness, had to remain silent for several  seconds to avoid shooting an insult back at her, something he hadn’t  had to do for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Nobody  has questioned you like this in a long time, either. </em>The two had  more to do with each other than he understood.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very  well,” Reito said quietly.  “She awaits your infinite wisdom.”  He gave a mock-bow and retreated towards the ocean.  As he did and  Midori vanished from view, he found his heart pumping and his mind  reeling from the sudden, unexpected, undesired conflict.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  was reeling as much as Reito was; she herself didn’t entirely  understand why she had been so suddenly hostile when a simple smile  and a few gilded words would have sufficed <em>to stroke the bastard’s  ego enough to make him fucking move for me.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">While  she considered this, another bastard was having his own ego stroked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  latter bastard would cause considerably more trouble than Reito, who  would undoubtedly come around in time.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  plan, </span></em>they had said, <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">is so near to genius that I find it  utterly preposterous, and we cannot throw our support behind it—not  until its preposterousness is shown to be…</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To  be something they would never admit to—a mistake.  They had made  many mistakes, but he had made none.  Not yet, anyway; he wasn’t  stupid enough to discount the possibility, nor was he stupid enough  to cover for it in the event that he had made one.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If I  have made a mistake, it can be explained to the press.  If my </em>men <em>make a mistake…</em>then <em>I am in trouble. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  was, of course, why he had needed so much money. The more you paid a  man, the fewer mistakes he was likely to make.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And the  more likely he was to cut and run, like that bastard…what had his  name been? Alder? Something like that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No  matter.  The problem would be resolved shortly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Very  shortly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  may commence,” he said into his small comlink.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Now it  was only a waiting game. Operations rarely began with a rush, but his  operations also rarely ended in defeat.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Woods  were a lot of things to Minoru, most important thing they were right  now, he understood almost as soon as he passed the first line of  trees, walking slightly in front of the girl, Shiho, were dangerous.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wild  animals were the least of his worries. He kept his hand close to his  gun, wishing desperately for his backpack and his sniper rifle; <em>those </em>would have made him, at least, feel better.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  seem nervous,” Shiho remarked from behind him.  “There aren’t <em>really </em>that many animals in the forest here, and they’re as  afraid of us as we are of them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The way  she said it was at least mildly infuriating to Minoru, but he  suppressed his urge to snap back. <em>She’s thirteen, Minoru.  Fourteen, tops. You know how they are.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or  at least, he thought he did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,”  he nodded, not easing his hand away from his weapon for an instant.  “You’re right, of course. I’m just edgy is all.  It comes with  the territory.”  He regretted saying this in his subsequent breath;  he was, in fact, used to saying it to women, but the women were  typically older and a lot more naked than Shiho.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  territory is that?” she asked, her voice not so much curious as  wry.  “Are you a hunter or something? I thought that was illegal.”   Wry or knowing. Neither made him particularly comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmm...,”  Minoru said cleverly as his mind reeled, reaching out in every  direction at once for something to say to quell Shiho’s curiosity.  Something that <em>didn’t </em>involve the numerous illegal  activities that he actually <em>did </em>participate in. <em>Oh, I’m  a hunter of sorts. I just hunt the </em>gag <em>most dangerous prey of  all </em>gag.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  what would that be, Minoru?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Oh.  Um. Whales. You know, Ahab got his ass pretty well handed to him by  one of those.  You gotta watch your back around them whales, you do. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yeah.   Right. With a great, powerful effort, he forced calm on himself, and  began to relax.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then  something dropped next to him, and he drew on it and nearly put three  bullets into his old backpack which held his old sniper rifle. It had  a small note taped to it; he holstered his gun as Shiho stared at him  in awestruck silence, and grabbed the backpack, ripping the small  note off and reading it to himself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You’ll  need it soon. Keep her with you. It’s the safest place for now.  –Akira</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Oh,  shit. </em></span></p>
