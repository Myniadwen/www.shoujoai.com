<p>I never could decide
whether being around Natsuki back then was more of a blessing or a
curse. On the one hand, her presence was the only thing in the world
I knew of that could bring me true joy, but there was always the
constant reminder that I could never have her how I wanted. For a
long time, I was able to keep my feelings hidden from her. She was
completely oblivious that I even cared for her as a friend back then,
so focused was she in her mission to avenge her mother.<p>Eventually, in a series
of events I’d really rather not remind myself of if I can help it,
she found out about how I really felt about her. There was a pretty
ugly period where I thought she’d rejected me, but eventually she
brought me to my senses and explained that although she couldn’t
feel the same way for me, she did accept my feelings. She even said
it felt nice to be loved like that. At the time, I was hurting so
badly from her rejection that it was all I needed to hear.</p><p>I thought I could
handle things after then. After the way Natsuki had saved me, I owed
her to be there for her, however she wanted me. She seemed to just
want me as a friend, so I tried to be the best friend for her I could
be. I hoped that one day I would be able to sort my feelings out and
love her just as a friend, as she did me. It wasn’t to be, though.
I only fell further in love with her over time.</p><p>The one small blessing
was that Natsuki didn’t seem to mind this. Even though I became
more daring with my teasing of her over time, referring quite
blatantly to how I felt about her, she never seemed to get upset or
uncomfortable. Sure, she might have blushed cutely at my teasing, but
I don’t count that. That was the whole point of my teasing, and I’m
pretty sure she secretly appreciates it anyways. The important part
was that she never pulled away from my touch or got really upset. She
wasn’t lying when she said that it made her feel good to be loved,
even if she couldn’t return it.</p><p>I wish I could say the
same for myself. Although my successes in making her blush and act
all cute brought me moments of happiness beyond anything else I’d
ever found in life, they were always followed by moments of sadness
when I had to remind myself of the limits to our relationship. Both
of these emotions became more extreme as time went on. I was able to
push things gradually further with Natsuki, until I was bordering
just below actual romantic contact. The rush of these teases was
unbelievable, but coming back to reality was more painful than
anything I could bear.</p><p>I was able to suppress
all my pain around Natsuki, though. I couldn’t let her be upset for
me. I’d devoted my life to being her friend, and I couldn’t
burden her with the reality of how she was hurting me. I was good at
holding my emotions back, but it was a different story when it came
to Natsuki. I’d let her into my heart, and that gave her the power
to hurt me deeply. I couldn’t ignore that pain forever, and it
needed to come out somehow. I eventually had to start letting out all
of it in a good cry periodically. I’d curl up in bed, hugging a
pillow I dearly wished could have been Natsuki while I bawled my eyes
out. I was putting myself through hell when I was alone so I could
experience moments of heaven when I was with my love.</p><p>I don’t know for sure
how things would have proceeded if it weren’t for what happened one
day which changed everything between us. I actually think now that
Natsuki might have eventually fallen for me, and let me go just far
enough with one of my teases that it stopped being a tease and turned
into something more. Things were headed in that direction, I think.
But that wasn’t how things turned out.</p><p>It all came to a head
one day, when Natsuki had come to my house for some help on her
English homework. Things went about as they usually did between us. I
helped her out, she was too adorable for me to resist, I teased her,
she blushed, and so on. But there was one particular tease at the end
which was just a little bit too much. It was a step up from anything
I’d done before, but the situation just seemed to lend itself too
well for me to resist.</p><p>I was sitting next to
Natsuki at the time. In a previous tease, I’d moved right up
against her under the pretense of getting a better view of her
homework. Her pride wouldn’t let her say anything about it, but it
seemed to be affecting her somehow. She’d been getting a bit tense
and nervous. She didn’t seem scared, though; if she had, I never
would have gone through with it. Maybe it was because of how our
proximity was affecting me that the thought popped into my head, but
why I did it doesn’t really matter now.</p><p>“Natsuki,” I said
softly, getting the girl to look over at me. I confirmed then that
she wasn’t really afraid of me being that close to her when I gazed
into her eyes. I even let myself imagine that she was getting aroused
from it, much as I was. It was through these little fantasies that I
was able to allow myself the purest moments of pleasure. “I just
wanted to congratulate you on how well you’re doing today.”</p><p>Natsuki opened her
mouth to reply, but words failed her. It was then that I lost myself
to the fantasy. In my mind, she was definitely aroused by our
contact, so I took advantage of it to see how far I might be able to
push things. I turned slightly in my seat to face her, and I leaned
my head in. My eyes locked with hers as I approached, and I tried to
put as much of my love for her as I could into them.</p><p>I watched carefully as
I neared for any sign of fear or rejection from her, but I didn’t
see any. Natsuki was frozen in place as my lips neared hers, as if my
gaze had put her into a trance. She wasn’t rejecting me. I don’t
know what might have been going on in her mind at the time, but she
was ready to accept my show of affection for her. It was probably
just an extension of how she was willing to accept my affection for
her in general, but it was further than she should have had to go.</p><p>Of course I didn’t 
go
all the way through with it. I couldn’t burden Natsuki with having
to silently put up with me kissing her romantically when she didn’t
feel anything for me. But I did go far enough to know that she didn’t
plan to resist. I made it to the point where our lips just barely
touched, and I paused there. It wasn’t quite a kiss, but it was
close enough that she would have moved away if she weren’t ready
for an actual kiss.</p><p>Content in this
knowledge, I quickly withdrew. In one fluid motion, I pulled my head
away from her and stood up from my seat. Glancing at the clock as if
I’d just noticed the time, I said, “Ara ara, it would appear that
Natsuki had better get going soon. It’s been longer than I
thought.”</p><p>As soon as Natsuki
realized what I’d done to her, her face turned an adorable shade of
red. “Shizuru!” she grunted, and I met her protest with a soft
giggle. My laughter faded, though, when I caught the look in her
eyes. It was relief. Natsuki was relieved that I hadn’t actually
kissed her. I guess it made sense for her to feel that way, but it
still tore at my heart. It was all I could do to hold myself together
in front of her.</p><p>Shaking her head and
sighing, Natsuki pushed herself up from the table. She strolled
reluctantly to the door which led to the main hallway of my house.
Before she passed through it, she turned back and gave me a smile
that caused a pang of need in my heart. “Thank you for the help,
Shizuru,” she said. Her voice was sincere, and I knew that she
really didn’t mind about how I’d been teasing her previously.</p><p>“Of course, Natsuki,”
I replied. I gifted her with one of the smiles I save just for her. I
called this one the “I’ll do anything for the one I love”
smile. Maybe it was just my imagination, but I thought I saw
Natsuki’s smile grow a bit wider in response.</p><p>With a slight nod,
Natsuki left through the doorway. A few seconds later, I heard the
front door open and close as she left me. All at once, the emotions
I’d bottled up flooded over me as I knew that Natsuki was gone. I
collapsed to the table and held my face as tears poured out. I cursed
myself for taking advantage of Natsuki and almost kissing her. I
could never have her, and I shouldn’t have been acting as if I
could. It hurt like hell to just be her friend, but if that was all I
could get from her, then I would take it and be grateful for it.</p><p>All the usual 
thoughts
passed through my mind as I sat there and cried. It seemed all the
worse this time, with how close I’d gotten to actually kissing her.
I felt pathetic, to break into tears so quickly after she’d left,
to completely lose control over myself like that. I didn’t even
have the ability to move to my bedroom to hug my “Natsuki pillow,”
like I usually did when I got upset.</p><p>“Shizuru?” I froze
between sobs at the sound of Natsuki’s voice coming from just in
front of me. My mind whirled into a state of panic. What was she
doing there? She was supposed to have left. I couldn’t let her see
me like this, but it was too late… “I just realized I forgot the
keys to my bike and…” Natsuki trailed off.</p><p>Her voice was full of
concern for me, but that just made everything harder. I might have
been able to pass off my state with some excuse if I’d been able to
keep my cool, but I lost it at the sound of her sweet voice, caring
so much for me. But she couldn’t care the way I needed her to, and
it was torture to be so close and yet so far. The flow of tears from
my eyes resumed once more. I didn’t want to let Natsuki see me like
this, but there was nothing I could do anymore.</p><p>“Shizuru…?” Her
voice was even more full of concern now, and there was even a little
pain in it. That pain was exactly what I’d been afraid of, why I’d
tried to hide my own pain from her. I didn’t want to hurt her with
the knowledge of how she hurt me. I’d tried so hard to keep her
blissfully ignorant, but I’d finally slipped up and blown it all.</p><p>“What’s wrong?
Please… you can tell me…” No, I couldn’t. If there was a
chance to keep her at all in the dark about the pain she was causing
me, I had to take it. She’d probably figure it out before too long,
but it would still be some more precious time she wouldn’t have to
know the truth.</p><p>After a few painful
minutes while she waited for a reply and I prayed for some sort of
reprieve, I heard Natsuki’s footsteps start to approach me. I think
she probably planned to give me a hug, but I didn’t give her the
chance. I didn’t think I could stand being any closer to her at
that time; it would only hurt more. And so I ran away. I bolted from
my chair and into my bedroom, locking the door behind me. I curled up
on my bed with my pillow and squeezed it as tight as I could, weeping
into it.</p><p>I was horribly ashamed
with myself at the time. I was supposed to be strong, to be the cool,
collected kaichou. But Natsuki broke down all of my barriers, and her
catching me with my guard down had sent me running to my room like a
pathetic little girl. So I lay there, hoping she might go away and we
could pretend this had never happened. Of course, I knew better in my
heart. Even if it wasn’t the right way, Natsuki did care deeply for
me, and she would never be able to let this go.</p><p>So, it was no surprise
when Natsuki knocked on the door and called out to me, “Shizuru,
please. Let me just talk to you…” Nor was it a surprise when
Natsuki tried the doorknob a few seconds later and cursed when she
found that it was locked. I just lay there in as much silence as I
could manage through my sobs, determined to wait her out. She’d
have to give up eventually, and then I could try to proceed with
things as if this hadn’t happened (though I’d have to be a lot
more careful in the future, of course).</p><p>“Damn it, Shizuru!”
Natsuki cried out. The pain and frustration was particularly evident
in her voice now, and it served to prompt a fresh wave of tears from
me. I couldn’t stand to hurt her like this. I rolled over to look
at the door, trying to decide if it might actually be worse to leave
her outside. She probably wouldn’t be able to let this go in any
case, so we’d have to talk eventually. Perhaps I could at least
stop the pain my pushing her away was causing.</p><p>“Shizuru, we are
going to talk about this one way or another,” Natsuki said, causing
me to sigh in resignation. “I’ll break this door down if I have
to so I can talk to you.”</p><p><i>Would you? Would you
really do that, Natsuki?</i> From her words, it sounded like she just
might have been serious, but I suspected she was really just trying
to sound tough to get me to open the door for her. It didn’t really
matter, though. I believed her when she said that we would end up
talking about this. There was no point keeping her in agony any
longer than necessary.</p><p>With another sigh, I
rolled off of the bed and walked to the door. I went slowly, as if I
were walking to my own execution. In a sense, I guess I thought I
was. I feared it would be the end of any possible close relationship
with Natsuki. There was no way she would let me continue hurting
myself for her sake.</p><p>I never ended up
opening the door, though. Apparently Natsuki hadn’t heard me
getting up and had assumed I wasn’t coming. The door jerked on its
hinges with a fierce noise as I approached, causing me to jump back
with a yelp. Natsuki was quite serious about breaking the door down
if she needed to, it seemed.</p><p>I know I should have
opened the door for her then, but I succumbed to another moment of
weakness. Deep down, it made me feel a little better that Natsuki was
this concerned about me. So desperate was I to stop the pain I felt,
I let myself once again imagine that it was because she really did
love me. I wanted to give her the chance to fully prove her love.
Having her come busting through the door to console me appealed to
the hopeless romantic within me, I guess.</p><p>Natsuki crashed into
the door again, and it looked like the door was actually straining
against its hinges this time. I believed in Natsuki’s strength, and
I figured that she might actually be able to do it after one or two
more tries. But I started to realize then how selfish I was acting. I
was hoping to indulge my fantasy at the cost of causing Natsuki pain
as she slammed her body into the door.</p><p>With a sigh, I started
to approach the door once more, so I could open it for her and face
whatever was to come. I stopped myself, though, as I realized that
Natsuki might be charging into it again very soon, and it would be a
very bad idea to stand behind the door just as she broke through. I
wanted to yell out to her to wait, but my voice failed me, and all I
could manage was a weak wail. Giving a mental apology to Natsuki for
the pain she’d endure on her third impact, I stepped to the side
and waited for her next attempt to come.</p><p>I stood there waiting
for many seconds before I realized that it wasn’t coming. Natsuki
had given up on me, just when I was ready to let her in. As tears
struck me again, I managed to stumble back to my bed and curl up with
my pillow once more. We would have to talk about this eventually, and
now I had an extra day or so to dread the inevitable death of our
friendship.</p><p>Maybe I should have
known better that Natsuki wouldn’t give up so suddenly. I was quite
surprised when I heard the click of my door unlocking a minute later.
Jerking my head over to the noise, I saw Natsuki coming into the
room, wielding a clothes hanger she’d deformed to use as a
makeshift lock pick. The expression on her face seemed to be a
mixture of frustration, concern, and sadness. I didn’t know which
of those was harder for me to see.</p><p>I rolled onto my back
and opened my mouth to say something to her, but no words came to
mind. There just didn’t seem to be anything I could say that would
make things any better. Depressed once more at my failure, I dropped
my gaze from Natsuki and choked back a sob. Not being able to bear
letting her look at my face in this broken state, I rolled back onto
my side to avoid her direct gaze.</p><p>I didn’t have any
illusions that I would be able to avoid her for long though, and so
it was no surprise when I felt Natsuki crawl onto the bed behind me.
It was also no surprise when I felt her squeeze an arm in underneath
me while the other came around on top of me to wrap me in the hug
she’d been planning to give me earlier. I had to choke back a sob
as she pulled me against her body. The contact was just as I feared:
painful in how her physical proximity reminded me of her emotional
distance, and it was all I could do to keep a fresh wave of tears
from breaking out.</p><p>“Please, Shizuru,”
Natsuki said softly. Although frustration had been on her face when I
last saw it, only concern and sadness remained in her voice now.
“Talk to me about this. I don’t want you to feel you have to run
away from me. Please tell me what’s hurting you, Shizuru.”</p><p>I was pretty sure that
Natsuki already knew – or could at least figure out easily – what
was causing me so much pain. Maybe she just couldn’t think of
anything to say, or maybe she was just trying to get me talking. I
still waited a bit, hoping she might not force me to say it out loud,
but she seemed content to wait me out. When I was able to figure out
the shortest way to describe my feelings, I choked out the words, “I
love you, Natsuki. But my love is inappropriate, and I can never have
you.”</p><p>Natsuki was silent for
a painful minute, but the pain eased when she finally spoke sweet
words to me. “No, Shizuru,” she said. “I told you before, your
love isn’t inappropriate. I’m happy that you love me, and I will
never be mad at you about it.” Her left hand loosened a bit from
the hug and started to stroke my side – tenderly, just as a lover
might. I trembled from that thought.</p><p>I knew that her words
were true, that she was fine with me loving her. But as long as she
couldn’t love me back, my love would still be inappropriate. That
was the real problem. “And you also told me,” I said, “that you
couldn’t love me the way I wanted.”</p><p>“Yeah…” Natsuki
sighed, bringing a wave of agony to my heart as she reaffirmed her
inability to love me. After a painful minute, she continued, “I
couldn’t.” A small flame of hope flickered to life from her use
of past tense, but it was surrounded by fear. I silently begged
Natsuki not to extinguish it; I couldn’t take any more pain. “Now…
I don’t know…”</p><p>I choked back another
sob, though it wasn’t of pain this time. She still didn’t love me
how I wanted her to, but it was a step towards it. It was hope, and I
clung onto it desperately like a life-raft she’d thrown out to me.
Even if she was only saying it to help ease my pain, I was going to
hang onto this hope for dear life.</p><p>“I’d do anything to
keep you from feeling such pain, Shizuru,” Natsuki said after a
minute, her voice now filled with pain of its own. “I was going to
let you kiss me earlier. I really wouldn’t have minded.”</p><p><i>That’s not true,
Natsuki.</i> “No…” I said. “I saw the relief in your eyes
when I pulled away. You didn’t want to kiss me, and you were glad
when you didn’t have to.”</p><p>There was another
painful silence after I pointed this out to Natsuki. It was the
relief I’d seen in her eyes that had brought all of this on in the
first place, after all. I wouldn’t forget it that easily.
Eventually, she spoke up. “I was afraid,” she said weakly. “Ever
since my father left me, I’ve been afraid to open up my heart to
anyone. But somehow, you managed to sneak your way in, and I’m
afraid of how I might feel about you.”</p><p>“<i>Might feel”…</i>The words echoed in my 
mind, and they tenderly stoked the flame
of hope that had sprouted there. I tried to stop myself from dwelling
on it, though. Natsuki had just made what must have been a very
difficult admission for her, and I had to say something to her.
Eventually, the words came to me. “You don’t have to be afraid of
me, Natsuki. I’m never going to leave you, however much it hurts
me.”</p><p>Natsuki’s body tensed
against mine, and her hand came back to squeeze me in a hug again.
“But I don’t want it to hurt you, Shizuru,” she said. She
paused a moment. With a sigh of frustration, she backed off a bit
from me and used her grip to force me to roll over and look into her
eyes – her beautiful emerald eyes, which I knew cared for me so
much. From the moisture in them, I realized that she’d been crying
as well, and it tore up my heart to know that I’d made my love cry
like this.</p><p>“Natsuki…” I
whispered, trying to get across an apology in my voice. Natsuki shook
her head slightly, telling me to just be quiet and let her talk now.
I gave a small nod to let her know I understood, and I then waited in
painful anticipation of what she might say.</p><p>At last, Natsuki said,
“Seeing you in pain like this, Shizuru, is worse than any fear I
might possibly feel. I don’t know if that means I love you, but I’m
not going to let my fear hold me back from finding out.”</p><p>I gazed deeply into her
eyes, trying to see if there was any hint of hesitance in them. I
couldn’t see any. She meant what she said. Natsuki might actually
be able to love me, and for my sake, she was going to try to find
out. It was more than I’d allowed myself to hope for. I almost
couldn’t take it. “Natsuki…” I said, sweet thanks lacing my
voice.</p><p>“I guess…”
Natsuki said, a bit nervously, “I could kiss you right now, if it
would help you… Maybe it could help me figure out how I feel…”
A small blush tinged her cheeks, and my usual loving response to
seeing her cute blush fought its way to the top of my emotions. I
pushed it back down, though. Now wasn’t the time to tease her.</p><p>“Thank you, Natsuki,”
I said. “But I don’t want you to kiss me just to make me feel
better, and I don’t want it to be awkward and planned like this…”
Natsuki nodded a bit uncomfortably, and I tried to smile back at her
to let her know I appreciated the thought. She really was too sweet
in trying to help me. She’d already given me more than I’d ever
expected just by letting me know that there was a chance for us, and
she still wanted to give me more.</p><p>“But… I need to do
something to figure things out…” Natsuki said as she drifted off
into thought. I couldn’t help but notice how cute her face got when
she scrunched it up in thought. I guess I was really getting better
by that point, if I could allow myself to appreciate those little
things again. “Maybe… we could try the ‘couple thing,’” she
said at last.</p><p>“The ‘couple
thing’?”</p><p>“Well,” she said as
another blush made its way to her cheeks. “I mean, we could go out
on dates or something… I don’t know, I’ve never done this
before.”</p><p>Natsuki was just
irresistible at that moment. She was being thoughtful, sweet, cutely
blushing, and it was all part of trying to figure out her feelings
for me, just to keep me from feeling anymore pain. I don’t think
I’d ever been more in love with her than I was then. “Alright,
Natsuki,” I said, allowing a smile to grace my face. This was a
brand new one, which my mind instinctively named the “Thank you for
being so sweet” smile.</p><p>Natsuki’s blush only
deepened at my reply, and she smiled nervously. “So… we’re a
couple now, then? You’re my girlfriend?”</p><p>Hearing the words from
her caused joy to leap its way through my heart. I hadn’t been
thinking of things quite that way. I only saw it as plans to try out
one date and see if things would work out between us, but Natsuki
seemed to have more on my mind. There was no way I was going to turn
it down, though. “Ara, if Natsuki wants,” I said.</p><p>Another nervous smile.
“…Okay,” she said as her face filled with red. I was barely
able to hold myself back from teasing her, and I just gave her a
loving smile. “Shizuru,” she said after her blush had settled
back to a manageable level. “I’m really going to try here. I want
to be able to love you as you love me. I’m still a bit afraid,
but…” She looked deeply into my eyes. I felt like she was gazing
into my soul and measuring my love for her. “It’s worth it.”</p><p>“Natsuki is too
sweet,” I said, as a blush made its way to my cheeks.</p><p>That blush was the
first of many Natsuki would elicit in me while we did the “couple
thing.” We went on our first date the following night, and we
shared our first kiss as a couple at the end of it. Natsuki still
wasn’t sure of her feelings at that point, but I swore I could feel
love in how she kissed me. I was in my own personal heaven from that
point on.</p><p>Eventually, we stopped
doing the “couple thing.” No, we didn’t break up; we became
lovers. We committed to each other; we gave ourselves to each other.
I never hide my emotions from Natsuki anymore, and I never run away
from her when I’m upset. I run straight to her now. She’s the
only one who can ever heal my heart.</p>
