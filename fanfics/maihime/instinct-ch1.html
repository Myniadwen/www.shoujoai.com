<p>One of the few lessons I remember my mother teaching me was that you always had to think 
through the big decisions in your life very carefully. All in all, it was good advice. It 
served me well when I had to figure out what to do about Shizuru's feelings for me when I 
learned about them, and also when I had to try to figure out my own feelings. The problems 
came when there just was no definitive answer, when things could really go either way, for 
quite good reasons.</p><p>The easiest answer is to just stick to the status quo. It doesn't 
require any action, after all, and it's what happens naturally as you puzzle things out in 
your mind. But that doesn't mean it's the right answer, especially if the only reason you're 
sticking to it is because your mind keeps coming to the conclusion that there are good 
reasons both for change and for keeping things the same. In the end, I just couldn't be 
satisfied with it.</p><p>My mental debate finally came to a head one day, after I'd been 
away from Shizuru for the last two days. We'd had a brief moment in bed two nights ago, when 
I'd gone over to see her but fallen asleep waiting, but no contact since I left for school 
the next morning. Two days really shouldn't have been that hard on me. I'd gone longer 
without talking to her before, such as when she'd gone to visit her parents for the weekend, 
but for some reason this time was just too much for me.</p><p>I tried to get to sleep for a 
while that night, but it just wouldn't come. Even clutching my pillow to my chest as a 
Shizuru substitute wasn't enough. I missed her, dammit! It didn't make sense, it wasn't 
rational, but it was. None of this was any good. I was going crazy for no good 
reason.</p><p>Did I really have to do this, night after night? Why should I, really? This 
just wasn't any good. But... the thing was... there were too many memories here. In this 
bed, even. I didn't want to leave them all behind. It was in this bed that Shizuru took care 
of me while I was sick with the flu, where we shared our first mutual kiss, where I finally 
realized that I was in love with Shizuru. And finally... where I first showed my love to 
Shizuru.</p><p>There was no way I could leave all that behind. But, life being what it was, 
I would have to eventually. I couldn't stay in the dorms my entire life. Even when fall hit, 
I'd have to share the room with someone. Life went on, and you had to leave these places 
behind, no matter how important they were to you. If I chose to go on my own earlier, so I 
wouldn't be missing Shizuru this much every night we couldn't be together, what was I really 
losing out on?</p><p>Dammit! I was doing it again, letting myself get lost in a maze of 
thought. Why was it so hard to admit to how I was feeling? The truth was... this dormroom 
just didn't feel like home to me. Granted, it had a lot of nice memories, but it wasn't my 
home. I hadn't really had any home since the accident that took my mother. My apartment was 
just a place for me to sleep, so it wasn't any big loss giving it up. This room had some 
more important memories, but it still didn't feel like a home to me.</p><p>It had been long 
enough. I had to listen to what my heart was telling me. Besides, all the good memories I 
had were just from this bed, on this mattress. Mattresses were easily replaceable. I could 
easily pick up another one to leave behind if I wanted to take my memories with me. Not 
tonight though. I could worry about that later. I needed to act now, before I started 
thinking again.</p><p>I didn't even bother to check the time, but I think it was sometime 
around 1 or 2 am. It didn't matter. I rifled around my room to shove a change of clothes and 
my toiletries into my duffel bag. I grabbed it and my backpack and I was off. Riding to 
Shizuru's house at night was really no problem for me. I knew the route by heart, so I could 
have driven it with my eyes closed if I didn't need to worry about traffic.</p><p>My brain 
started to nag me about this, but I quickly redirected its efforts into figuring out just 
what I should do when I got there. Many ideas ran through my head, but in the end, I decided 
to just keep it simple. I was never good at making things too elaborate, especially on short 
notice. Besides, Shizuru really just liked the simple gestures best, when it came down to 
it.</p><p>I parked my bike in Shizuru's driveway and made my way inside and towards her 
room. I hadn't made much effort to keep quiet, but she seemed to still be asleep when I 
entered. I hadn't been planning on this, but I realized that this was actually perfect. Just 
as she'd done for me two days ago when I'd fallen asleep in her bed, I crawled in behind 
Shizuru and delicately wrapped my arms around her in a hug.</p><p>Shizuru let out a gentle 
moan, and it was all I could do to stop myself from moaning as well when she pressed herself 
back into me and muttered out a sweet, “Natsuki....” I held back though, and I gently 
stroked Shizuru's side until I was able to rouse her from sleep. It still took her a bit to 
come to full consciousness and realize just what was going on. She wasn't one for questions 
though. She simply let out a yawn and cuddled back into me as she said, “Hi, 
Natsuki...”</p><p>“Hey Shizuru,” I said, giving her a loving squeeze with my arms. “I'm 
home.”</p><p>“...Home?”</p><p>“Yeah,” I said. I buried my face into the back of Shizuru's 
neck, giving her a soft kiss. “I'm finally home.”</p>
