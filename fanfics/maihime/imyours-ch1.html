<h1>I'm Yours (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leebot.html">Leebot</a><br> </h2>
<p>I Want This</p><P>---</p><P>A bout of nervousness
hit Shizuru as she pulled into her garage. Her birthday was almost
over, and she still hadn’t seen Natsuki. Even at the party Mai had
thrown for her, which included all of the friends she’d made in the
aftermath of the Carnival, Natsuki had been conspicuously absent. No
one there had known where she was; they’d apparently all been
expecting her to show up.</p><P>But it didn’t seem
possible that Natsuki would completely abandon Shizuru on her
birthday. Sure, there had been some tension between them, but it had
been there for quite a while. Natsuki had made it quite clear to
Shizuru after the Carnival that although she couldn’t return
Shizuru’s love in the right way, she would never hold Shizuru’s
feelings against her or complain about them.</p><P>At first, the tension
between them had arisen from Shizuru being unsure of how much she was
allowed to show her feelings and Natsuki trying to get used to the
displays of affection Shizuru did make. But as time passed, Natsuki
was able to put up with more, and Shizuru started to get bolder with
her advances. The tension between them started to morph as this
happened. Shizuru started to get the sense that maybe, just maybe,
she was wearing down Natsuki’s resistance.</p><P>Over the last couple
weeks, though, something had been different in Natsuki’s behavior.
She seemed more nervous around Shizuru, and she blushed a lot more
easily. There was a niggling fear in the back of Shizuru’s mind
that maybe she’d pushed Natsuki too far, and the girl had finally
broken and run today. It would serve her right if it had happened.
Natsuki had been clear about her feelings, and yet she still pushed.
She could have just been imagining that Natsuki was giving in and
starting to feel the same type of sexual tension around her that she
did.</p><P>But it would have just
been too cruel for Natsuki to disappear on Shizuru’s birthday.
However uncomfortable she might have been, she still did care for
Shizuru, and she would never hurt her like this. That left one
possibility: Natsuki was waiting inside Shizuru’s house to surprise
her. Shizuru had cut her friend a spare key a while back, so she
would be able to get inside. However, she hadn’t noticed Natsuki’s
bike anywhere when she’d driven in. It made her appearance inside a
bit more unlikely, but not impossible; she could have hidden it or
taken a taxi to help with the surprise.</p><P>Shizuru made a silent
resolution to herself as she got out of her car. She was going to
trust Natsuki. Either the girl was going to be inside waiting to
surprise her, or she’d have a very good reason for not showing up
today. Natsuki wouldn’t disappear on her birthday for anything
less. Still, she hoped that Natsuki would be inside. She silently
prayed that she’d find the girl waiting for her as she entered the
door to her house.</p><P>Shizuru wasn’t
blessed with the sight of Natsuki’s adorable face as she opened the
door, but she did see something that allayed all of her concerns. On
the door of the closet, across the hall from where she’d entered,
she saw a letter taped up. The handwriting was easily recognizable as
Natsuki’s. So, whatever the girl was up to, she hadn’t forgotten.
Shizuru released a sigh of relief as she approached the note to read
it.</p><P><I>Happy birthday,
Shizuru!</I></p><P><I>I’m sorry I didn’t
come to your party, but I really wanted to surprise you tonight. This
is your first birthday since we really became close after the
Carnival, and I really wanted to make it special for you. I thought a
lot about what present I could give you, but there was really only
one thing that I knew you wanted. You want me.</I></p><P><I>I’ll be honest
here, Shizuru. You’ve really worn down all my defenses in the
months since I learned about your feelings. When we first met, I was
terrified of getting into a close relationship with anyone at all. I
swore never to trust anyone again. But you just ignored that and
waltzed your way into my heart and became my best friend before I
realized it. I’m still terrified of romance, to be honest, but I
can hear you knocking at the door to my heart, begging to be let in.</I></p><P><I>I really 
have no
idea what I feel for you now, Shizuru, or even what I could feel. I
don’t know if I could ever love another girl, but if I could, then
it would definitely be you. I am feeling something weird for you, but
I don’t know what it is. It’s nothing like what I feel for Mai,
so it’s not simply friendship. But that alone doesn’t mean that
it’s love, or at least the type of love you want.</I></p><P><I>What I am sure of is
that I care for you, and I want you to be happy. I want to be able to
give you what you want most. I want to be able to figure out my own
damn feelings, to break past this fear. So, for tonight, for your
birthday, I’m going to give you what you want most. Tonight,
Shizuru, I’m yours. You can do whatever you’ve fantasized about
doing with me, and I’ll go along with it without complaint.
Hopefully I’ll even enjoy it. Either way, I should be able to
figure things out for myself, and in the worst case, I’ll still
have at least given you one night of what you craved most.</I></p><P><I>I’m still afraid,
Shizuru. So afraid that I couldn’t trust myself not to chicken out
when you got here, so I had to write all of this down in advance. But
keep this in mind: I’m not afraid of you, Shizuru, or what you
might do to me. I’m afraid of myself, and what I might feel. But I
need to face this fear now. Don’t let me turn back from this. I’ll
be in your bedroom waiting for you, whenever you’re ready. Just…
please be gentle.</I></p><P><I>-Natsuki</I></p><P>“Ara ara…”</p><P>---</p><P>Natsuki 
nervously
rocked back and forth on the bed as she knew Shizuru was reading her
letter. Part of her mind was telling her that she was absolutely
insane for doing this. She had little idea just how dark Shizuru’s
fantasies really got, and she was now giving her friend <I>carte
blanche </I>to use and abuse her body as she saw fit. She’d never
even let her friend see her naked before, and she was suddenly going
this far?</p><P>Then another part of
her mind – the part that had narrowly won out her internal argument
earlier – would argue back that she’d tried wading into things
and gotten pretty much nowhere, causing plenty of pain and
frustration for both her and Shizuru. She just had to jump into the
deep end, get past all of her fears, so she could know where she
truly stood. Besides, she really did like Shizuru, and she wanted her
friend to be happy. Shizuru’s happiness on her birthday was worth
whatever discomfort she might face in getting over her modesty and
giving her body up to the girl.</p><P>But then her mind
argued back, this wasn’t just an issue of modesty. This was big.
This was sex – her first time. She was giving her virginity up to
Shizuru as a birthday present, and she didn’t even know if she
loved the girl yet. Shouldn’t she be in love first, and then think
about sex?</p><P>Or maybe she already
was in love, and she just couldn’t admit it to herself. Love was
said to make people crazy, and this certainly seemed crazy enough.
Maybe her subconscious mind had already figured this out and had
pushed her into this decision in order to prove this to her conscious
mind. Besides, she’d already decided that she wouldn’t regret it
if her first time were with Shizuru. Shizuru was deeply in love with
her, and she knew that she at least loved Shizuru as a friend. She
couldn’t picture anyone else she’d rather do this with.</p><P>She could, on the other
hand, picture going through with this with Shizuru. It wasn’t even
that hard to picture. Her modesty did fight with her a little, but it
had lost a lot of its power over her recently. The entire scenario
had gotten itself lodged into her mind, and she couldn’t shake it
loose. Did that mean she really wanted it? Was that why she’d
decided to go through with it?</p><P>The sound of footsteps
from the hall interrupted Natsuki’s inner debate. Natsuki’s heart
leaped to her throat as she realized that it was actually happening.
Shizuru was coming, and she’d read Natsuki’s note. What would she
do when she came in? Would she pounce on her right away, or would she
take things slowly? Or would she think that the whole thing was silly
and just laugh and tease Natsuki about it until she blushed herself
to death?</p><P><I>Ugh, that would be
worse than her pouncing on me. Please, Shizuru. No teasing about
this, </I>Natsuki silently begged. She repeated the “no teasing”
prayer in her head until she saw Shizuru walk into the room.
“Shizuru…” she said nervously, a blush immediately rising to
face as the full weight of the situation hit her.</p><P>Shizuru was silent as
she walked up to the bed, so Natsuki tried to glean insight into her
state of mind by reading her face. With Shizuru, it was always a
difficult task, but there was definitely something different about
her expression now. It reminded her of one she’d seen on the girl’s
face after she’d kissed her near the end of the Carnival.
Pleasantly surprised? Flattered? At least it wasn’t her teasing
face, and she hadn’t yet jumped on Natsuki, so those were the two
most frightening possibilities eliminated.</p><P>“Natsuki…”
Shizuru purred as she came to sit down on the bed beside Natsuki. She
put a hand on Natsuki’s knee and gave the girl a smile that nearly
made her melt. Natsuki didn’t know what it was about that
particular smile that did it to her – she’d never seen Shizuru
give it to anyone else, and it always made a strange warmth swell up
in her chest. She waited for a moment as she entranced Natsuki under
her gaze before she continued. “Just the thought that you’re
trying so hard to figure things out is the best birthday present you
could ever give me.”</p><P>Natsuki could feel the
blush on her face deepening, but thankfully Shizuru didn’t comment
on it. Not trusting herself to talk, she just gave a stiff nod to
Shizuru.</p><P>Something seemed to
soften in Shizuru’s expression. She moved her hand up to gently cup
Natsuki’s cheek, causing another burst of heat to flood through it
from her deepening blush. “Natsuki is so beautiful,” Shizuru
murmured.</p><P>Natsuki’s heart
seemed to be pounding in her ears now, and she was sure that her face
was pushing the limits of turning purple. She was completely under
Shizuru’s grasp. Even if she hadn’t promised her friend to let
her do whatever she wanted, she didn’t know if she’d be able to
resist now. When Shizuru’s face started to move closer to her own,
very tentatively, as if waiting to make sure there was no sign of
hesitation on Natsuki’s part, all Natsuki could think of to do was
to lick her lips to make sure they were nice and soft for when they
met Shizuru’s.</p><P>But the contact wasn’t
to come. Shizuru paused in her approach, and she nervously bit her
lips. After a moment in which Natsuki felt herself being freed a bit
from the girl’s enchantment, Shizuru spoke. “I’m sorry. I just
can’t push Natsuki into anything she isn’t ready for,” she
said, an apologetic smile creeping across her face.</p><P>As the realization that
Shizuru wasn’t going to go any further with this struck Natsuki, a
surge of emotion welled up in her. It wasn’t relief, as she might
have expected, but disappointment. She didn’t stop to think too
much on it – she did <I>not</I> want to get back into that mental
debate – so she just let instinct drive her in the words she let
pour out of her mouth. “No. I’m pushing myself, Shizuru, and I
wouldn’t be doing that if I weren’t as ready as I can get. Stop
worrying about me. This is your birthday. Today, just take what you
want. Take me.”</p><P>Shizuru looked deep
into her eyes for many long moments, as if she were trying to read
the inside of her mind. “Natsuki really wants this?” she said at
last.</p><P><I>Want? I guess I’m
ready… but do I want this?</I> Natsuki looked back into Shizuru’s
eyes, and part of an answer occurred to her. <I>I want Shizuru to
have this, at least. But me? </I>Eventually, she let out a sigh.
Might as well just voice her thoughts to Shizuru; maybe she could
help figure it out. “I’ve never been sure about my own emotions,
my own wants. But I haven’t been able to get this out of my head
since it occurred to me a couple weeks ago. I’ve been having
constant dreams of giving myself up to you, and it isn’t scaring me
at all, like facing my own emotions does. If that means I want it,
then… I guess…”</p><P>Shizuru’s face held
an expression Natsuki had never seen before. There was a slight blush
on her cheeks, and her eyes looked like they might be on the verge of
tears. She nodded her head slowly, and she cautiously said, “If
Natsuki thinks she wants this… then kiss me.”</p><P><I>She wants me to
initiate it? </I>Natsuki had thought this would all be a lot easier
if she just let Shizuru take over. She hadn’t planned on taking
much of an active role tonight. But apparently Shizuru needed at
least this to prove that she was ready. Taking a deep breath to steel
herself and nervously licking her lips once again, Natsuki
tentatively started to move her head towards Shizuru’s. She allowed
her eyes to drift closed and her head to tilt to the side as she
prepared herself for the moment of contact.</p><P>It came sooner than
she’d expected, and a torrent of sensations immediately rushed
through her body and mind as Shizuru’s lips met her own. She didn’t
know if Shizuru had moved in on her own when her eyes had closed or
what, but her mind couldn’t focus on questions like that. Her world
consisted only of Shizuru’s lips and her own. She didn’t even
think of moving her lips; just feeling the soft, sweet texture of
Shizuru’s as they fit together so perfectly was enough.</p><P>Natsuki’s body seemed
to be in an uproar as this happened. An indescribable aching had
filled her chest. Waves of heat seemed to radiate from her heart,
which was beating rapidly and fiercely. The kiss seemed to be digging
at the barriers in her heart, and something that just might have been
joy – it certainly felt good enough – was leaking out. A little,
embarrassingly girlish voice in the back of her mind started cheering
with glee that she was sharing her first real kiss with Shizuru, and
she didn’t have the heart to silence it.</p><P>The euphoria of simply
experiencing the kiss started to give way to a desire to explore more
sensations. Natsuki really wasn’t sure what she was supposed to do
to in a kiss like this, but she knew she wanted to feel more of the
velvety texture of Shizuru’s lips, and she couldn’t do that if
her lips remained still.</p><P>Natsuki tentatively
softened the pressure of the kiss so she could move her lips around a
bit. She dragged her lips slowly back and forth over Shizuru’s,
allowing her to revel in their soft feeling. This action caused
Shizuru to let out a soft moan of pleasure. Natsuki didn’t think
she’d ever heard the restrained, graceful girl let out such a
carnal sign of pleasure before. The sound of it, along with the
thought that she was able to break through the girl’s barriers, was
quite intoxicating.</p><P>Her actions seemed to
give Shizuru an idea, and it wasn’t long before the girl
reciprocated Natsuki’s motions. Her enthusiasm grew quickly, and it
was only a matter of seconds before she overwhelmed Natsuki in the
kiss. Her hands crept around to the back of Natsuki’s head to pull
her tightly against her mouth. Rather than being put off, Natsuki
took it as a relief that with Shizuru taking over, she didn’t have
to worry about being the one to push things forward anymore. She just
allowed herself to relax and react as Shizuru controlled the pace of
the kiss.</p><P>Natsuki quickly came to
the conclusion that Shizuru was an amazing kisser. All the need she’d
felt in her chest previously was building up now, and her body was
filled with a pleasurable warmth. It was as if she were becoming
drunk on Shizuru. The girl was filling a long-empty void in her
heart. She wanted Shizuru. She wanted to give herself completely to
her friend, to allow her to dig her way into her heart and soul and
give her the fulfillment she’d lacked for so long.</p><P>A surge of passion
arose in Natsuki at this realization. She wrapped her own arms around
Shizuru and fought back against Shizuru’s enthusiastic kissing with
her own. She was soon matching Shizuru’s enthusiasm with her own,
allowing all of her emotions to pour out into the girl. A torrent of
pleasured moans and squeaks made their way out of her mouth as she
lost all of her inhibitions. Instead of letting herself be
embarrassed, she welcomed these noises as another way for Shizuru to
know how much she was enjoying this.</p><P>Unfortunately, a
pressing biological need brought their kiss to an end. In all of her
enthusiasm for the kiss, Natsuki wasn’t able to gather enough
breath to keep up her energy, and her lungs started to beg for air.
Shizuru seemed to be in the same trouble, and she made no complaint
when Natsuki tilted her forehead forward against Shizuru’s to pry
her mouth back and give it some much needed breathing room.</p><P>After a couple deep
breaths, Natsuki allowed her eyes to open and look into Shizuru’s.
Her friend looked just as worn out from their kiss as she felt, but
her eyes held a definite smile within them. Natsuki had never taken a
chance to gaze this closely into them, and she had to note that they
were by far the most beautiful set of eyes she’d ever seen.</p><P>“Ara…” Shizuru
started to say as she caught her breath. “I think Natsuki enjoyed
that as much as I did.” There was a distinct sound of happiness in
her voice, her glee restrained only by her oxygen-deprived state.
Natsuki suspected that she’d meet the full force of it soon, when
Shizuru had a chance to recover.</p><P>“I did, Shizuru,”
she said. She was doing a bit better with recovering her breath.
Although Shizuru was no slouch in combat, she hadn’t dedicated
herself to it as Natsuki had, so she was still a bit behind in
recovering her endurance now. Natsuki continued, “I know I want
this now. Take me, Shizuru. I’m yours.” No hesitation made its
way into her voice. She couldn’t even find a trace of it buried in
her mind. Everything finally seemed so clear.</p><P>Shizuru’s eyes filled
with desire, and Natsuki braced herself. She knew that as soon as
Shizuru had gotten her energy back, she’d waste no further time in
pouncing on her. She’d already made Shizuru wait far too many
months. She’d surely be anxious to get on with things now that
there was nothing holding her back.</p><P>Natsuki saw the flash
of intent in Shizuru’s eyes a moment before the girl pounced on
her. But it wasn’t the type of assault she’d been expecting.
Instead of pinning her back on the bed so she could go to work from
on top, Shizuru had gripped her in a tight hug as she pushed the girl
down. “Ara…! Thank you so much Natsuki!” she said into
Natsuki’s ear. “Thank you, thank you, thank you! This is the best
birthday present you could have ever given me!”</p><P><I>Okay… </I>Natsuki
was stunned by the sudden outburst of giddiness from Shizuru. She
guessed she could understand it; it only made sense that she’d be
quite happy to learn that Natsuki was capable of loving her back the
way she wanted – even if she wasn’t quite at the point of being
able to say the words yet. But it still seemed just wrong to see
Shizuru – who was known for nothing better than being graceful and
serene under everything up to and including Haruka’s rants –
letting her emotions pour out like this.</p><P>As the shock wore off,
Natsuki decided she’d simply look at it as being sweet that Shizuru
was dropping her usual mask with her. She hesitantly wrapped her arms
around Shizuru to return the hug. “You’re… um, welcome,
Shizuru,” she said. “But uh…” A blush rose to her face, but
she pushed through it to get the words out she’d intended. “The
present… isn’t over yet… you know…”</p><P>“Ara…” Shizuru
said with a little chuckle. “Natsuki said I could have whatever I
wanted from her, and I’ve gotten it. I know that Natsuki really is
able to love me as I love her, and she knows it too. That’s exactly
what I wanted most. I can’t ask for anything more.”</p><P>“But… um… if you
want more…” Natsuki said. <I>Why do I keep pushing for this?</I>

she wondered. <I>Do I want it for myself that much? </I>A burning
need in Natsuki’s chest rose up to answer that question, and the
blush on her face deepened at the thought. <I>Damn it… I’m more
perverted than Shizuru…</I></p><P>Shizuru loosened her
hug a bit and pulled back so she could look at Natsuki’s face. Her
own face was plastered with a huge grin unlike anything Natsuki had
seen on her before. “If it’s okay with Natsuki, I think I’m
already overloaded with glee tonight. I don’t think I could take
much more. For now, I just want to cuddle with and kiss my Natsuki
all night long.”</p><P>Even though Shizuru was
asking her to give less than she’d intended, Natsuki still couldn’t
resist the look in her eyes. “Alright, Shizuru, we can do that if
that’s what you want. It’s your birthday after all.”</p><P>Natsuki wouldn’t have
thought it would be possible, but Shizuru’s grin grew even wider.
“Thank you, Natsuki.” After a moment of gazing happily at
Natsuki, a mischievous glint appeared in Shizuru’s eyes. “Though
if Natsuki still can’t get that particular fantasy out of her head,
Christmas is coming up in just a few days…”</p><P>Natsuki couldn’t stop
the blush from creeping to her face, or the protest of “Shizuru!”
that slipped from her mouth. A little voice in the back of her mind
reminded her, however, that she still hadn’t found a Christmas
present for Shizuru, and it promptly went off to fantasize about how
she could best give herself as a present.</p><P>The mischievous glint
in Shizuru’s eyes seemed to double in intensity. The part of
Natsuki which still didn’t appreciate her teasing – which was
growing smaller all the time as she started to appreciate how it was
one of Shizuru’s ways of showing her affection – started to dread
what was coming. “Tell me,” Shizuru said. “Is Natsuki still
mine?”</p><P>“Er… yeah,”
Natsuki said, wondering what she was getting herself into. She wasn’t
going to lie, though. “And I don’t think that’s going to change
anytime soon.”</p><P>“Then Natsuki
wouldn’t mind if I labeled her as such?”</p><P>“Labeled?” A vision
flashed through Natsuki’s mind of her walking through school with a
big “Shizuru’s” stamped on her forehead, blushing profusely
with every glance at her from passers-by. “Er… um… I don’t
know…”</p><P>“Ara,” the smile
didn’t seem to fade at all from Shizuru’s face. She’d probably
been expecting this reaction. “Then I’ll just have to do it in a
place where only Natsuki will know it’s there.”</p><P>Before Natsuki could
wrap her mind around what was happening, Shizuru had sat back up and
was straddling her as her hands worked to undo the top few buttons of
Natsuki’s blouse. Natsuki’s blush started to spread down through
her chest as it came into Shizuru’s view, prompting a happy giggle
from the girl.</p><P>When her blouse was
open enough to expose the tops of Natsuki’s bra-clad breasts to
Shizuru, the girl dove her head down to start slathering the tender
flesh at the top of Natsuki’s left breast with licks and kisses.
The sudden bursts of pleasure took over Natsuki’s mind, and she
completely forgot about Shizuru’s plans of labeling her as she
threw her head back to let out a moan.</p><P>Shizuru seemed to
settle on one particularly tender spot and she started to kiss it
deeply. Pleasure radiated from the spot of her kiss, and Natsuki let
out a deep moan. Even as Shizuru started to suck hard on the spot,
the pain this elicited was mixed inextricably with pleasure. Natsuki
didn’t know how to describe it, really. There was pain, definitely,
but it was enjoyable pain, like the aching Shizuru had caused her to
feel in her chest earlier.</p><P>Eventually, Shizuru
released her suction on Natsuki’s breast. She pulled her head back
to observe her handiwork. After a few seconds, a smile crossed her
face. “Perfect. Now Natsuki is properly mine.”</p><P>Natsuki’s mind
finally came back to remembering Shizuru’s promise to “label”
her. She tilted her head up to get a look at the spot on the top of
her breast where Shizuru had kissed her. A dark red mark was already
there, and it seemed to be slowly darkening and growing as she
watched. At the realization, she threw her head back down onto the
bed with a sigh. <I>A hickey. Of course. I really should have seen
that one coming.</I></p><P>“Ara? Is something
wrong, Natsuki?” Shizuru crawled back up over Natsuki so she could
look into her face.</p><P>“No…” Natsuki
allowed a small smile to tug at her lips to make sure Shizuru knew
she was telling the truth. “You can just be so silly sometimes, you
know that?”</p><P>“<I>I’m </I>silly?
Who’s the one who tried to give herself to me before we’d even
shared our first kiss?”</p><P>Natsuki struggled for a
moment, but she didn’t have a good answer for that one. In lieu of
a snappy comeback, she decided she’d get even with Shizuru for her
previous tease. Before Shizuru had a chance to figure out her
intentions and stop her, Natsuki had flipped the girl over onto her
back and set to work making sure Shizuru was properly labeled as
hers.</p>
