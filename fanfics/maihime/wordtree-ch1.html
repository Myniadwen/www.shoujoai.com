<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s  notes: This first chapter is really nothing but an introduction, so I  doubt it will do much of anything for most of you.  Just be sure you  come back and read the other two chapters. I think you’ll enjoy  them.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I see  everything at this school.  Usually, I know when somebody is going to  confess practically before they do.  I am the Queen of Gossip, and I  enjoy myself thoroughly.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It’s  nothing but a hobby, though. I don’t let it distract me from my  real life.  I have a real life, you know.  I’m not just a Reliable  Source.  I have friends, decent grades, and I let my eye wander  around sometimes.  On rare, rare occasion I even get asked out to  dinner.  I usually accept, have a great time, and then stop talking  to them after a few months.  It’s nothing personal.  My eye just  has a habit of sliding away from somebody almost as fast as it slides  onto them.  I’m sure I’ve been called an Ice Queen in low tones,  behind my back.  I’m okay with that:  I know who said it anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I guess  the question I always ask myself now is why, if it’s only a hobby,  I let it distract me so utterly from what was right next to me? I  guess there’s no excuse for me missing it.  If it was because my  “hobby” was truly an obsession, then I obviously wasn’t very  good at it.  Otherwise…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There’s  no excuse, but I think that’s okay.  I was never asked for one.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  really, I guess, it didn’t take me too far off-guard when it  happened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even  though we were so close, so comfortable together, I was still just <em>teacher </em>to her in my mind.  You invite especially close  teachers to your house for dinner sometimes.  You call them just to  talk.  That was just how we were. Close friends, but, in my mind,  separated from some invisible barrier that I always just assumed was  the same barrier that kept teachers from mounting students in the  water closet when nobody else was around.  I guess I kind of felt  that with everybody.  There was a wall between me and everybody else;  it was the wall that strangers feel between each other.  It was a  mythological wall, that wall of “ice” that refused to budge, no  matter how hard you pushed, but that slid aside if you opted merely  to walk through, your eyes wide open.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And even  though we were so close, so very comfortable together, she still felt  it necessary to do it the old-fashioned way when she finally did it.  She could have just come right out and asked, in the middle of  school.  I would have said the same thing.  In spite of what I  perceived to be an impregnable wall, there was still only one real  answer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  still, she did it the old-fashioned way.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Chie,”  Aoi said, her face red and her eyes wide.  “Please…just do it.  This is torture.” Her breathing was heavy, and she was coated with  a thin layer of sweat.   Her hands were warm on my shoulders.  It was  pretty obvious to me that she was desperate.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But she  was also in a little physical pain.  Watching her sweat was fun, but  I <em>did </em>like her, so I didn’t really want her to die.   I  drank another mouthful of water from the fountain, savoring the cool  wetness on my lips, and then moved aside to let Aoi, who had taken  the mile far too quickly for her untrained body (not that I was one  to criticize), in beside me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  slurping was fairly well unladylike, if I do say so myself, but I  also felt a twinge of regret as I watched her gulp the water down.  She looked pretty pained, to be honest.  I wondered if maybe I had  taken it too far for just a moment—a rare instant of doubt—until  she came up and grinned at me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  an evil woman,” she said to me.  “You know that?  If Sister  Yukariko saw you right now, why, I wouldn’t be shocked to hear her  damn you to hell on the spot!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  too busy working out a way to get Sister Nao sent down there under  the radar,” I smirked back.  She stepped out of the way and some  other poor, sweating bastard gratefully lurched forward, propelling  herself face-first into the cool spray.  We started walking towards  the locker banks, Aoi’s face shining a little strangely.  Something  odd popped into my head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know, you could have taken a drink before I finished,” I said. “Do  you just enjoy being tormented brutally?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shrugged nonchalantly.  “Mai was waving for me from the locker  banks. I had to go talk to her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is  that why you freaking raced around the track like that?”  I  prodded.  “You felt that soon, your true love would beckon to you  from a steel forest of sweaty women and stinky shoes, and you knew  that being early would get you a little more play?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi  went  red (redder), and I frowned. It wasn’t like her to respond QUITE so  strongly to my teasing; but a moment later, she said, “I wanted to see  how fast I could do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That </em>was more circa Aoi Senou; it felt genuine to me, and my brow  unknitted itself.  In my experience, if something is wrong, it  doesn’t stop being wrong, genuinely, for even a second.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So I let  it go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  what did Mai want?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Advice.   She told me, and I quote, ‘I’m sorry to trouble you with  something like this; normally I’d ask Chie, but I’d rather not  have my troubles posted on the blackboards tomorrow.’”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I rolled  my eyes.  “Is she <em>still </em>mad about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  little,” Aoi said as we entered the locker banks.  As soon as we  entered, a sharply stale aroma filled my nostrils, and I coughed  slightly.  “Extra-ripe today,” I said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,”  she shrugged. “Mile-run days are always like that.”  She said it  distantly with an air of routine, like a woman in a windowless  nuthouse might say, <em>Nice weather today. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  just to set the record straight,” I continued, “<em>I </em>did not  write that Yuuichi hadn’t been staring at Mai’s tits as intently  as he usually did on the blackboard. <em>That </em>was Mikoto.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  you told.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Are  you mad at me?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  I told.  But it was still not me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fair  point,” she said, her voice a little quieter.  She looked away, and  I frowned.  As soon as we got to our lockers, I put my hand on her  shoulder, still damp.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you pissed at me too?” I asked, a little knot in my stomach.  “I  apologized to her, but if it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  Aoi shrugged with her other shoulder, so that my hand stayed in  place.  “It’s nothing like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you feeling alright?” I swear, my eyebrows were going to have a  crease between them before I hit twenty.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  fine.” She looked up and smiled at me as we sat down on the  benches.  “Just…thinking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“About  what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing  important.  Don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  sighed.  Had some boy shot her down? She had said a few days ago that  she was thinking about confessing to somebody—she wouldn’t tell  me who; so close to the act, this was probably wise because, like it  or not, I do run my mouth sometimes when I don’t intend to—that I  knew.   Had he shot her down?  If he had, so help me god, he would  fucking <em>burn </em>in this school.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really,”  her smile was a little bigger this time, and in spite of myself, I  smiled back at her.  “I’m <em>fine.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I let my  breath out, a little relieved, and opened my locker.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I guess,  looking back on it, I always had a little crush on Aoi, I just never  knew what to do about it.  I grew up in a pretty old-fashioned house.   Being a lesbian wasn’t really forbidden to me; it was just never  presented as a viable option for one of the ways I would turn out.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  fairness, I’m bisexual, not a lesbian. I still look at boys. In my  mother’s eyes, this was probably worse. At least as a lesbian I was  a sinner.  Bisexual, I was “looking at the true path and taking a  shit on it.”  She said this the day that I moved out to be a reporter and  live somewhere where she wasn’t; I had told her I was bisexual two years before that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The way  I crushed on Aoi wasn’t particularly novel in Japan: Instead of  acting on it, or at least thinking about it (I never really knew it  was there until…until I eventually needed it), I ignored it and  decided to protect the living shit out of Aoi.  I loved her, and  pretended that I loved her like a sister.  That way, it wasn’t  really a lie, so it didn’t trigger that little bullshit-detector I  had lurking in me, somewhere between my stomach and the base of my  spine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  wasn’t usually my bullshit detector that was off. Most of the time,  it was my head, glossing over the obvious that would lie in the  details, hidden safely away from me. A glance; a single word; any of  these things I might gloss over by mistake, and then a nice fat pile  of horse crap might go undetected forever.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or maybe  not.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
In spite  of how nonchalant I wanted to be about the whole thing, I couldn’t  stop my breath from catching in my throat a little when I saw the  little frilly-pink letter sitting in my locker on top of my shoes.  Yes, boys took me out, and I even got occasional love-letters stuffed  in my locker, but …something about it…the timing…my eyes  widened in almost as much horror as shock, and it was pretty obvious  on my face for half a second.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  chanced a glance at Aoi, and saw that she looked just as surprised as  I did.  She was in the middle of turning from looking at me to  looking at the letter that I extracted from my locker, and after she  got a good look, she glanced back at me, and something about her told  me she was almost…hurt.  I didn’t even stop to think about why;  at the moment, it didn’t matter to me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m  sorry, </em>I wanted to say, <em>this isn’t my fault.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instead,  I opened it.  It was written in a boy’s messy characters.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Meet  me by the fountain after school, </em>it said. <em>Please do not be  late, for the sake of my heart. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  wanted to roll my eyes and gag.  I also wanted to tear the boy’s  throat out, whoever it was.  That one flash of <em>hurt </em>in Aoi’s  eyes had latched onto my heart somewhere, dragging it down into my  thigh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  wouldn’t do either. But I was certainly not going to accept his  feelings right now.  It seemed a little bit unfair somewhere in the  back of my head, but the back of my head was going to have to stuff  it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anger  wasn’t my style, though. I didn’t really like confrontation, for  all my tough thoughts.  So rather than professing, loudly, my undying  hatred for the author of this card, I read it aloud to Aoi with a  huge grin on my face, and we both laughed at the last part—it was  positively <em>atrocious. </em>The hurt was gone from her eyes, and I  smiled, laid my hand on her shoulder, about to suggest that we both  go get lunch and forget about the whole thing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let’s  go together, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  blinked.  “You…what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let’s  go together.  You’re planning on turning him down, are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Unless  it’s a supermodel or Shibutani Subaru, yes, you bet I am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  let’s go together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  frowned.  “Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He  can think we’re together or something. I don’t know.  It’ll let  him down easier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Aoi,  you stupid bastard, </em>I thought without knowing why. <em>Stop being  so nice to people. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Stop  being so unfailingly…kind.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  agreed anyway, and, it being the last class of the day as it was, we  set out for the fountain, still in our sweaty, gritty clothes.  For  effect and all.  Everybody knew lesbians were the only females that  sweated or held hands for more than a few seconds at a time, so we  held hands the entire way there.</span></p>
