<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leebot.html">Leebot</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/oneesama-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><p>Shizuru the Lech</p><hr><p>Natsuki let out a sigh as she de-materialized her robe. Her 
body 
always seemed to get over-energized and her mind hyperactive when it was on, which was great 
for battle, but not so much when she was simply using it to fly. As far as she knew, she was 
the only Otome who experienced this particular effect from wearing a robe, though others 
mentioned that they had their own changes in mood when materializing.</p><p>Shizuru, for 
instance, said that wearing a robe always made her feel even more graceful and at peace. It 
was just her luck, really, to get a beneficial mood change from it. Meanwhile, Natsuki had 
to deal with being constantly on edge. She’d had to face a lot of teasing from Shizuru about 
this when they first started training together. The girl thought it was trivially easy to 
maintain her grace while materialized. It wasn’t until Natsuki managed to short out her robe 
during a particularly grueling practice session and had to have it replaced with a modified, 
more durable version that Shizuru admitted that perhaps it wasn’t Natsuki’s fault that she 
had trouble maintaining her grace.</p><p>Her Ice Silver Crystal robe had been quite a relief 
when she’d first received it, as it was actually capable of handling the energy her body 
seemed to build up when she materialized. It still wasn’t perfect, as the energy actually 
had to go somewhere, and so she found that after she wore it for an extended period, it 
could still get quite uncomfortable and twitchy. Fortunately, she’d found out that the 
robe’s cannon had a seemingly endless capacity for charging energy, and with some practice 
she was able to use that to her advantage.</p><p>Although this solved the problem of her 
excess energy and allowed for some incredibly powerful attacks, it still failed to solve the 
problem of how materializing affected her mood. And then there was also the problem that it 
seemed that whenever some problem came up in which she could take advantage of her cannon’s 
energy store, events conspired to make it impossible for her to materialize at all. At least 
she’d been able to get in a couple of good shots at the end of the Wind Uprising, and she 
doubted anyone else would have been able to pull off the destroying the Harmonium. She 
wasn’t <i>completely</i> useless – as she had to repeatedly remind Shizuru whenever the 
woman got it in her mind to tease her about it.</p><p>Not that she really minded that type 
of teasing. Truth be told, she actually appreciated it – a fact that Shizuru had managed to 
drag out of her early in their relationship and had held over her head ever since. It was 
the other type of teasing which Natsuki really minded. Shizuru had a very annoying habit of 
flirting with seemingly every young girl who crossed her path. When Natsuki was around, she 
always made sure to give a sly glance to make sure that Natsuki was watching her. It was 
infuriating, to say the least.</p><p>Shizuru’s intentions were quite clear, though – or at 
least, they’d seemed to be, up until today. Natsuki had always been quite shy about their 
relationship. She just wasn’t good at showing these things in public, putting herself out 
like that. Shizuru, on the other hand, had made it quite clear that she wanted everyone to 
know about the two of them. She claimed that it was because she wanted it to be known that 
she was officially Natsuki’s, though Natsuki privately suspected that her girlfriend looked 
at things the other way around.</p><p>And so Shizuru went out flirting with other girls in 
front of Natsuki, trying to taunt her girlfriend into exploding and making their 
relationship public. It was torture, really, seeing Shizuru act like that with others. She’d 
really wanted to let it all out, but she’d just never had the guts. It was ironic, really. 
As brave as she could be in battle, she was a complete coward when it came to 
relationships.</p><p>Things had changed, though, when she had to face truly losing Shizuru. 
She’d tried desperately not to let on just how much she was hurting while Shizuru was 
petrified. It was all she could do to focus on the task at hand and not worry about whether 
Shizuru would ever recover. She’d pulled it off, but just barely. But then, when she’d 
learned that Shizuru had recovered, everything had spilled out. She didn’t care anymore if 
people saw how much she cared. Feeling Shizuru’s reassuring presence once again was all that 
mattered to her.</p><p>After that, everything was out in the open. There weren’t really that 
many people in the room who saw her, but it was enough. Word soon got out that she and 
Shizuru were a couple, much faster than Natsuki would have expected. She suspected, though, 
that Nao was behind that speed. Nao had actually tricked Natsuki into admitting to her 
relationship a couple years previously, but she’d fortunately kept silent about it thanks to 
some strong threats. Though now that others knew about it as well, Nao likely figured she 
was in the clear and went out of her way to spread the word.</p><p>Though Natsuki would have 
eagerly followed through with her threats to have Nao expelled or stripped of her position – 
and maybe her pants, too, to get some revenge for the incident in Aries – prior to this 
point, she just didn’t have the heart for it anymore. Word had gotten out about her and 
Shizuru, and the world hadn’t ended. It had changed, certainly, but it kept on spinning. Fan 
shops had started selling new action figures and posters which featured her and Shizuru 
together, and she was now free to show Shizuru a little extra affection in public, but 
nothing much else had really changed. Still, Nao had disobeyed her demands, so she’d have to 
at least see about putting some plans into action to take her revenge for the 
“incident.”</p><p>But Nao wasn’t the one who was really frustrating her right now; it was 
Shizuru. Her behavior this morning had been enough to cause Natsuki to snap and run off 
without telling her. Well, she had been planning on making this trip today anyways, but 
she’d originally intended to at least let Shizuru know she was leaving. She was still going 
to keep her intentions a secret though, as she wanted to make sure the end result was a 
surprise for Shizuru.</p><p>But then she’d been thrown off-guard when Shizuru was leaving to 
her meeting with Queen Mashiro. Arika had come to escort her, and Shizuru had done her thing 
again with the girl. She brazenly flirted with her in front of Natsuki, and even gave her a 
kiss on the forehead. Natsuki had started fuming at the sight. Arika seemed to pick up that 
something was wrong, but Shizuru remained cheerfully oblivious, simply delighting that she’d 
provoked a reaction from Natsuki.</p><p>Natsuki had gotten used to Shizuru’s flirtations in 
the past, because she knew that Shizuru was just doing it to try to provoke a reaction from 
her and make her take their relationship public. At least, that’s what she’d thought. But 
even now, when their relationship was out in the open, Shizuru was still doing it… It wasn’t 
just teasing anymore. It was bordering on cheating, and Natsuki had no intention of putting 
up with it any longer.</p><p>She’d fretted quite a bit about what to do with Shizuru as 
she’d flown out. Heading off without leaving a message for her was a start, but it was 
hardly enough. With some time to think, though, her anger had abated somewhat. Shizuru was 
probably just flirting out of habit now. She still deserved a little punishment for doing so 
thoughtlessly, but simply worrying her for a day should accomplish that. Though, to get the 
message through to Shizuru that she’d have to stop her behavior, some more extreme measures 
might be necessary.</p><p>She certainly wasn’t going to think about calling off her plans, 
though. She’d already put too much effort into this already, and it was much bigger than one 
small fight between her and her girlfriend. Already, things had involved pushing a couple 
bills through to Mashiro’s desk, and it was only a matter of time before the news of them 
broke. She couldn’t turn back now, and she certainly didn’t want to in any case.</p><p>That 
being said, there was still one task left before her. She’d been able to keep one person 
happily oblivious about her relationship with Shizuru, out of fear of what her reaction 
might be, but she couldn’t wait a day longer. She was sure to find out on her own, soon 
enough. Natsuki could at least head off the news and tell her herself. Taking a deep breath 
to steel herself, Natsuki raised her hand and knocked on the door of the only person on Earl 
other than Shizuru capable of intimidating her: the Countess Saeko Kruger.</p><hr><p>It’s 
amazing, when I look back on it, just how much happened in my first year at Garderobe. I 
developed my first crush (realizing I was a lesbian in the process), got molested, and had 
my heart broken. Then I became a bargaining chip of sorts in a power contest between Pearls, 
fell in love, and eventually even made love for my first time. And all that’s just what went 
on with Shizuru. I could add in everything that happened between Mai and me, but it doesn’t 
really seem as important, to be honest. Shizuru’s the one who matters most to me. She’s the 
love of my life, and so all of my memories have sorted themselves out to revolve around 
her.</p><p>I was smitten with Shizuru from the first time I saw her. At least, that’s how I 
viewed things at the time. I didn’t really know what love was back then, and so I thought I 
was in it when it was really just a blind crush mixed with idolization. My feelings for 
Shizuru weren’t based on who she really was, but just the mask she put up for the world. 
Actually, not even that. It was the image of her I superimposed over her mask that I fell 
for. I couldn’t even see her façade correctly, so blind was I.</p><p>I wasn’t the only one 
to fall for her, though. Within moments of being exposed to her charm as she greeted the new 
class, it seemed that roughly two thirds of them had developed a crush on her. It wasn’t 
that bad the whole year, though. Soon enough, word got around about Shizuru’s proclivities, 
and her number of fans declined to a somewhat more reasonable number.</p><p>The thing with 
Shizuru was, she treated her fans a bit too intimately. She was fond of giving a 
particularly enthusiastic fan a kiss on the forehead just for the sake of making her 
overload with joy and pass out. Although that action crossed the line of appropriate conduct 
according to Garderobe’s rules on sexual harassment, Shizuru didn’t even stop there. She 
went a step further to take her own pleasure from her fans, which would have easily gotten 
her in trouble for molestation if it weren’t for the fact that they were all so willing to 
have her feel them up. Of course, there were a ton of girls who wouldn’t have appreciated 
such shows of affection, but the way Shizuru played things helped to sort them all out 
almost perfectly – the “almost” referring to me.</p><p>Near the start of the year, Shizuru 
was circumspect with how she treated all of her fans. She was affectionate and had this way 
of showing each of us just a little personal attention to make us think we were all 
important to her, but she didn’t cross the line right away. She waited a bit, until she had 
a good view on a couple girls who she knew would be receptive to her advances, and then she 
struck. Her guesses were right, of course, and so she got away with it. As a few other girls 
made it clear they wouldn’t mind, she shared the love with them as well.</p><p>Eventually, 
word got around most of school about Shizuru’s actions. No one really thought any less of 
her for it, as it was always just with girls who were receptive. She simply had a reputation 
as both an idol and a player. Eventually, her fans segregated out into a couple camps. The 
close fans were the ones who didn’t mind her touch or actively sought it out. There were 
also her more general fans, who were girls who simply idolized her, but didn’t have a more 
physical attraction to her. Of course, there were also a fair number of girls who simply 
weren’t her fans, such as my roommate, Mai Tokiha.</p><p>And then there was me. I didn’t 
really fit into either group of fans. The real problem with my case was that I was 
completely oblivious to all the rumors running around school. I was always really awkward 
socially, and so I found myself completely outside the loop at Garderobe. The only person I 
ever really talked to was Mai, and that was only because it was unavoidable and she kept 
working at getting me to open up. Although Mai was a bit more in the loop than I was, she 
didn’t pay attention to what was said about Shizuru, and so I remained oblivious to her 
tendencies.</p><p>Even if I’d known about what Shizuru liked to do, I probably wouldn’t have 
fit in well with either group of fans. As I mentioned, I had a pretty big crush on her, but 
it wasn’t anything physical. My parents had brought me up quite strictly, and I had rather 
conservative views about how a relationship should progress. It was already stretching 
things enough to be considering a relationship with a girl. Beyond that, I thought of things 
developing very slowly between us, with nothing physical happening for a <i>long</i> 
time.</p><p>Yes, I was oblivious. Hopelessly oblivious. I spent my fair share of time 
hanging around on the outskirts of Shizuru’s close fans, and I still managed to remain 
oblivious to what she liked to do to the ones who got close to her. I saw it happening a 
couple of times, but I always rationalized it away in my mind. To me, she was a perfect 
goddess, and she’d never do anything like that outside of a deep, committed relationship. 
With no one to break me out of my delusion, it just grew, and I fell deeper into my illusion 
of love.</p><p>I wanted Shizuru for my own, but I was clueless as to how to get her. I 
dreamed of becoming her heya-gakkari and using that as a stepping stone to build up our 
relationship, but I didn’t think I had much chance at it. It was Shizuru’s choice, after 
all, and all I could do was to try to stand out to her. I fought my way up to the position 
of second Coral, behind only Mai – who wasn’t competing for Shizuru’s attention – so at 
least I had that going for me. However, I was never one of the fans closest to Shizuru, as I 
was just too shy to push my way in towards her, and so I didn’t think she ever really 
noticed me.</p><p>Fortunately, I was wrong on that count. I found out that Shizuru at least 
knew who I was and finally got a chance to interact directly with her one night, when the 
school was abuzz with word of an intruder on Garderobe’s grounds. All the Pearls were called 
out to help track the intruder down, but even that wasn’t deemed enough, and so Mai and I, 
the top two Corals, were also enlisted to help.</p><p>We didn’t find the intruder, but we 
did stumble upon a cat that had wandered into the grounds. For some reason, this cat 
reminded Mai of me. On the outside, I tried to present a composed, ladylike appearance, but 
I was still a girl underneath. To prove this, she had the bright idea to pull up my skirt, 
and I couldn’t help but scream in shock as I jerked away from her.</p><p>Mai chuckled in 
response to this, which only deepened my embarrassment. I glared at her through the blush 
that had formed on my face, but she ignored this and said, “I think you and I are going to 
become good friends, Natsuki-san.”</p><p>I grunted in indignation, but before I could reply, 
a melodic voice came from behind me. “Ara ara, this seems like an interesting 
conversation…”</p><p>I turned around in shock, knowing who was standing there. It was my 
idol and my secret love: Shizuru Viola. I nearly swooned just from her proximity to me and 
the fact that she was looking me directly in the eyes. “Sh-sh-sh-shizuru-oneesama…” I 
managed to stutter out.</p><p>“Ah! Shizuru-oneesama, hello,” Mai said behind me. Not being 
cursed with idolatry for the girl, Mai was much more able to keep her composure than I was. 
I was too engrossed in Shizuru’s presence to care, though.</p><p>“Ara, you’re Coral Number 
One, Mai Tokiha,” Shizuru said with a nod to Mai. She then turned to me and said, “And Coral 
Number Two, Natsuki Kruger.” She gave me a quick wink with this that I knew Mai didn’t get. 
Did she recognize me as one of her fans? And she remembered my name! She knew who I was. I 
wasn’t just another face in the crowd to Shizuru.</p><p>I was so overwhelmed with glee that 
Shizuru knew who I was that I didn’t notice that she’d brought a young girl along with her 
until Mai asked, “And so who’s this?” Looking down, I caught sight of a young girl with dark 
green hair clinging to Shizuru’s leg. I silently envied her position.</p><p>“This is our 
intruder, Tomoe-chan,” Shizuru explained. “She tells me that she’s a fan of mine, and snuck 
in just to get a glimpse of me.”</p><p>“Aha,” Mai said. She bent down to her knees to talk 
to Tomoe. “You must be quite pleased then to actually get to meet Shizuru-oneesama, and to 
have her escort you around like this.”</p><p>A big grin split across Tomoe’s face. “Yup!” 
she said.</p><p>Trying to suppress my jealousy over Tomoe’s luck, I turned to Shizuru and 
said, “So what are you going to do with her?”</p><p>“Well, I don’t think there was any harm 
really done,” Shizuru said. I could feel my heart pound in my chest as she talked directly 
to me. Sadly, she then turned to Tomoe and kneeled down. “I’ll tell you what, Tomoe-chan: 
I’ll escort you out of Garderobe, and then if you want to see me again, you can work really 
hard to become an Otome. I’m sure we’ll meet again someday if you do that.”</p><p>A blush 
appeared on Tomoe’s cheeks, and she nodded happily. Sensing her moment, Shizuru went to do 
her thing. She leaned forward and planted a kiss on Tomoe’s forehead, causing the girl to 
faint in an instant, though she had the fortune of being caught in Shizuru’s arms. I looked 
on this sight with stunned jealousy. I wanted to be the recipient of Shizuru’s kiss, not 
some little stalker!</p><p>To my chagrin, Shizuru noticed my jealousy – not that I was doing 
much to hide it. She turned to me and a sparkle appeared in her eye as she stood back up. 
“Ara, I wonder if Natsuki would like a kiss, too?”</p><p>My head turned into a grapefruit at 
that suggestion. My mind ran wild with thoughts of my beloved Shizuru kissing me, but I also 
worried about what she must have thought about me, staring at her so openly. But, to my bad 
luck, my embarrassment kept me from being able to say that I would indeed like a kiss from 
her, and I missed my chance as Shizuru walked away with a last farewell to Mai and 
me.</p><p>I let out a sigh as Shizuru left, finally able to breathe again. I barely was able 
to take a single breath, though, before Mai took it away from me again when she said, 
“You’re one of Shizuru-oneesama’s fans, aren’t you, Natsuki-san?”</p><p>“Uh?” I choked out 
as I spun to face Mai. Gulping down my embarrassment and nervously twirling my hair around a 
finger, I said, “How did… how did you…?”</p><p>“Oh come on!” Mai said, rolling her eyes. 
“It’s so obvious. You practically have little hearts in your eyes when you look at her, and 
it was so obvious you wished you were in Tomoe-chan’s place.”</p><p>I really didn’t know 
what I could say to that. There was no point in denying it, and yet I couldn’t bring myself 
to admit it out loud. So I decided simply to give a grunt of acknowledgement as I turned to 
walk back towards our room.</p><p>Mai was silent for a bit, but she wasn’t going to let the 
subject drop. “Natsuki-san… you were telling me about the heya-gakkari system earlier, and I 
was thinking… why don’t you become Shizuru-oneesama’s?”</p><p><i>I wish</i>. I sighed at 
this. “It’s not up to me, Mai-san. Shizuru-oneesama has to choose on her own, and there’s 
just too much competition for her…”</p><p>“Hmm…” Mai thought about this for a few minutes. 
By the time we reached our room, she seemed to have come to a solution. “Well then, we’ll 
just have to make sure you stand out to her. Let me help you, Natsuki-san, and I guarantee 
you that you’ll be Shizuru-oneesama’s heya-gakkari before you know it.”</p><p>I thought 
about this for a bit. I really doubted that Mai could help, but the prospect was just too 
tempting. “Well… I guess so…” I relented. I opened up the door to our room and walked in, 
allowing myself to drop to my bed as exhaustion finally caught up with me. “But why would 
you try to help me like this, Mai-san? What’s in it for you?”</p><p>Mai came in behind me 
and took a seat on her bed, across from me. She looked at me as if I was an idiot – which, 
looking back, I was, though not for the reasons she thought. “I told you, Natsuki-san,” she 
said. “We’re going to be good friends, and this is what friends do for each 
other.”</p><p>“Oh,” I said. I’d never really had a friend before, being quite isolated in my 
youth, so this was new to me. “Well, thanks then… Mai.” I looked at her nervously, hoping 
she wouldn’t be put off by my addressing her without an honorific. That was what friends did 
with each other, wasn’t it?</p><p>I needn’t have worried. Mai simply smiled at me and said, 
“You’re welcome, Natsuki.”</p><p>I’ll give Mai this: Her plan was inspired. Unfortunately, 
it relied on me being able to build up my courage to face Shizuru. I begged with her to come 
up with something to get around it, but she insisted that there was just no other way. I 
eventually relented, though, as she had a point. I was never going to get anywhere with 
Shizuru if I was too afraid to talk to her.</p><p>The key part of Mai’s plan was getting 
Shizuru relatively alone. She was normally so swarmed with fans whenever she was in public 
that I wouldn’t be able to push through to her. Even if I could, if I brought this issue up 
while in the middle of a crowd of her other fans, I’d certainly be surrounded by a chorus of 
“No, pick me!” and lost in the shuffle. I’d have to get her alone for her to give me any 
particular thought. It still wasn’t much of a guarantee, but she just might take me up on it 
if I give her the opportunity.</p><p>Now, the problem, of course, was how to separate a mob 
of Shizuru fangirls from Shizuru. Mai revealed to me that back in her native country, 
Zipang, there was a habit among fangirls of creating what were called “fanbooks,” roughly 
translated. They were essentially amateur-made illustrated novels, focusing on whatever the 
author’s obsession was. Shizuru, being quite the idol, was bound to be the focus of many of 
these, though she’d only risen to that status recently, and so not many were made yet. A few 
simpler pieces of idolization of her had been made though, and I featured one poster of her 
from such pursuits above my bed.</p><p>However, the previous year at Garderobe, Shizuru was 
the heya-gakkari to Anh Lu, who was quite the idol herself. Quite a number of fanbooks had 
arisen starring Anh, and a few of them also featured Shizuru. One in particular was quite 
explicit, to say the least. It was far too much for me, to be honest. It made me embarrassed 
just thinking about the existence of such a book defiling my goddess. When Mai was able to 
get a copy of it, I wasn’t even able to glance at the cover without breaking out into a 
blush.</p><p>Shizuru’s other fangirls, however, weren’t quite so limited. I may have been 
oblivious to how Shizuru actually treated them, but I did notice those girls talking about 
wanting such things from Shizuru. As such, finding a book like this would be irresistible to 
them. If they were told they had a limited chance to access it, it would even be enough to 
draw them away from Shizuru.</p><p>When the day came for us to put our plan into action – 
that is, when the urgency of having to ask Shizuru before she decided overwhelmed my 
nervousness and I told Mai I was ready – Mai covertly brought the book into the cafeteria 
during our lunch break. Shizuru, as expected, was surrounded by a swarm of her fans. I hung 
back while Mai went to work.</p><p>I saw her approach one of Shizuru’s more respected fans: 
Carla Bellini, the fourth Coral. She whispered something to the girl. I couldn’t hear what 
was said, but it drew Carla’s attention away from Shizuru. Once she was pulled away, Mai 
slipped her a quick peak of the book. I could see Carla’s eyes grow huge in their sockets, 
and a blush formed on my face at the thought of what she was looking at.</p><p>Carla’s 
attention snapped back to Mai and she spoke up. Her voice wasn’t quite as soft as Mai’s, and 
so I could make out some of her words. It sounded basically like she was demanding Mai tell 
her what she needed to do to get her hands on that book. Mai whispered back to her, too low 
for me to hear what she was saying, but I knew basically what it would be from our 
discussions of the plan. The deal she would give was that Carla could peek at it for the 
lunch hour as long as she was fair and shared it with the rest of Shizuru’s fans who wanted 
to see. She’d also have to be careful to make sure no one else – especially Shizuru – found 
out about it. In return, she’d just owe Mai a favor sometime in the future.</p><p>Of course, 
Carla accepted the deal eagerly, judging by her ferocious nod. Mai slipped the book out to 
give it to her, while Carla went to slip the word to the rest of Shizuru’s fans. Soon, the 
news had reached all of them, and they flowed out from around Shizuru. They vacated the 
lunchroom – possibly off to the room of one of them – leaving Shizuru sitting stunned by 
herself.</p><p>Shizuru looked around in surprise as she suddenly found herself bereft of 
fans. She even got up from her chair to better look around and see where they had all gone. 
The confused look on her face called out to my heart. It was my fault that this was 
happening. I knew it wasn’t really bad, but even hurting her this little bit was hard on me. 
That impetus was all I needed to get moving towards her. I didn’t have to think about 
building up my courage at all for it.</p><p>Shizuru caught sight of me as I walked up to 
her, and relief washed over her face. It was probably just that she was happy she had some 
fan there, but I allowed myself to believe that she was specifically happy to see me. She 
gave me a stunning smile which nearly caused me to faint, and she said, “Ara, Natsuki-chan 
certainly is faithful to be able to resist whatever’s pulling everyone else away from 
me.”</p><p>A blush rose to my cheeks as Shizuru said this. I gave her a quick nod of 
agreement and tried to steel myself for what I had to say. I’d rehearsed the words so many 
times; I just needed to spit them out now. I could see Mai moving in behind me out of the 
corner of my eye, prepared to back me up and offer her support.</p><p>Squeezing my eyes shut 
so I could pretend I was doing this like in practice, without Shizuru around, I forced out, 
“Shi-shizuru-oneesama… I was hoping that, if you hadn’t selected a heya-gakkari yet… you 
could please consider me. I’m a really hard worker, and already second in the class, so I 
can make you proud and handle all of your needs. I really, really respect you, 
Shizuru-oneesama, and I just want to be closer to you.”</p><p>I pried my eyes open to look 
at Shizuru’s face. I was scared as hell that she would reject me, saying that she had 
already chosen another girl or that she was still looking around, but I didn’t see any sign 
of that in her face. She was a little surprised, but she seemed to be truly considering 
this. The thought that I had a chance and that this might work out sent a wave of euphoria 
through my body. My face broke out into a smile, and I looked up at her with my most hopeful 
eyes.</p><p>A light tickling on my chest caught my attention. I looked down to see that 
Shizuru had started to trail her fingers back and forth across it. As she did this, she said 
to herself thoughtfully, “Ara, well Natsuki-chan certainly is quite pretty, and she’s quite 
skilled as an Otome, too. She certainly meets my standards there. There’s just one last 
thing I’ll need to make sure she’s skilled enough at…”</p><p>My thoughts ran wild as Shizuru 
said this. Half of my mind was screaming in joy that she thought I was pretty, while the 
other half was worried that this mattered so much to her. I wanted to get to know the real 
person inside her, not just her mask. Were my looks all she cared about?</p><p>Shizuru’s 
next actions caused all of my mind to shift over to worrying. The hand that had been 
trailing across my chest dropped down to cup my right breast, and it gradually tightened its 
grip. Panic shot through my body at this. I couldn’t believe this was happening. It had to 
be a mistake. Why would my Oneesama do something so… so crude? I looked up into her face to 
see it coming down towards mine emotionlessly. It was lined up to bring her lips straight 
towards my own.</p><p>At that moment, I snapped. Nothing about this was right. A loving 
relationship shouldn’t be starting out this way… She shouldn’t be molesting me in public… or 
anywhere, for that matter. I wasn’t even prepared for my first kiss. I couldn’t give it up 
in this manner, even if it was for my idol… no, my former idol.</p><p>“No!” I swung my hand 
around with all the force I could muster. It met Shizuru’s cheek with a crack that resounded 
throughout the cafeteria and caused all eyes to focus on us. I couldn’t have cared less, 
though. I backed off from Shizuru and brought my hand up to protect my abused breast. On the 
verge of tears, I managed to get out, “W-what are you doing, Oneesama?”</p><p>Shizuru took a 
moment to reply as she held her cheek. I could see tears forming in her eyes, and my mind 
warred over whether I was proud or ashamed to have caused them. Eventually, Shizuru removed 
her hand from her cheek, showing a terrible red welt which had already formed.</p><p>“Ara? 
Did you not want this?” Shizuru said. Her voice was soft, as if in disbelief that this all 
could be happening. “It seemed to me that, asking to become my heya-gakkari, you also wanted 
this... My fangirls would all be glad to be in your position...” It sounded like she was 
trying to piece this all together in her mind, to rationalize her own actions and explain 
mine.</p><p>But she was dead wrong. That wasn’t what I wanted from her. I didn’t know about 
her other fangirls, but it wasn’t what I wanted. “No,” I said, still barely able to hold my 
voice steady. “It’s different. This is…”</p><p>Shizuru shook her head, dazed. She could 
barely focus her eyes on me as she further tried to justify her actions. “But, what’s 
different? You all want me, what else is there? Their beautiful and kind Oneesama… So, I'm 
just answering that wish for you…”</p><p><i>What else? There’s love, Shizuru-oneesama. Do 
you not even know what that is?</i> This thought was enough to push me over the edge. I’d 
dreamed about her for so long, and yet she didn’t even know what love was. My heart broke at 
that very moment. Tears poured from my eyes. “Shizuru… Oneesama…” The words were my farewell 
to my dream. The Oneesama I thought I knew had died.</p><p>“Wh-why are you crying…?” Shizuru 
asked, incredulous. She still didn’t get it. “I was the one who was slapped, wasn’t 
I?”</p><p>Why couldn’t she understand? How could she be so dense as to how I felt to still 
not realize it? I tried to force out an explanation, but the right words just weren’t 
coming. “But… such…” After that, all I could get out was a sob of frustration.</p><p>Shizuru 
started to speak, but I couldn’t stand to hear anymore. I turned and fled from the cafeteria 
so I could cry in peace back in my room. I could hear Mai calling out to me, and then 
cursing at Shizuru as I was on my way out, but I didn’t stop for her. I needed escape. I 
couldn’t let myself break down in front of everyone else any longer. Even as I ran, though, 
I wondered what the point was. I didn’t have anything left to live for, with my Oneesama 
lost for me. What was the point if everyone saw me breaking down or not?</p><p>I passed a 
few of Shizuru’s fans on my way to my room, and I roughly shoved them out of my way. If they 
wanted those things from Shizuru just as she said, then they were as guilty as her. They 
seemed to notice that I was hurt, at least, and so they didn’t press the issue. They were 
better than I gave them credit for, I guess.</p><p>Finally, I made it to my room. The first 
thing I did as I entered was to rip the poster of Shizuru off of my wall and tear it up in a 
rage. I shredded it as best as I could until I finally lost heart in the endeavor and 
collapsed to the floor in tears. That was how Mai found me when she entered the room. She 
had the sense not to say anything then. She simply sat down behind me and held me in a hug 
as I cried my heart out.</p>
