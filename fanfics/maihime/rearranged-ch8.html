<a href="../maihime/rearranged-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Natsuki awoke the next morning wrapped in Shizuru&#39;s arms. It was so 
comfortable and warm she almost went back to sleep, but Shizuru&#39;s parents 
did arrange to have her taken to school so she had to wake up. Placing 
a light kiss on Shizuru&#39;s lips, she watched the other girl&#39;s eyes 
flutter open and said, &quot;I&#39;m getting up now to get ready for school. You 
don&#39;t have to get up.&quot;

Making an unintelligible sound of frustration, Shizuru grabbed Natsuki 
and pulled her back down onto the bed and held her tightly in place. 
&quot;No, you&#39;re staying right here,&quot; she said, her voice hoarse from 
sleeping.

&quot;Of course I&#39;d rather stay here, but you know I have to go.&quot;

Shizuru was about to protest again, but a sharp knock on the bedroom 
door startled them, causing Shizuru to release her raven-haired captive.

&quot;Pardon me Miss, but I must remind you that your guest shall be leaving 
shortly and needs to be downstairs for the car in fifteen minutes,&quot; a 
voice said from outside the door.

&quot;Alright, thank you,&quot; Shizuru called out.

Turning to Natsuki, she said playfully, &quot;Well, I guess you won this 
time, but next time you won&#39;t get away so easily!&quot;

&quot;Please, it&#39;s not like I want to get away. By the way, what are you 
going to do today?&quot; Natsuki asked as she began dressing for school.

&quot;Well, my parents are out of town now so I don&#39;t really have anything 
I&#39;m obligated to do. Maybe I could come over to your place tonight?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Natsuki quickly agreed, her mind already racing at the prospect 
of having Shizuru all to herself again.

Once she was ready, she went over to the bed where Shizuru was sitting 
and tried to quickly kiss the girl goodbye. Shizuru had other plans 
however, and held Natsuki&#39;s head in place as she deepened the kiss. She 
smiled at the glazed-over look in Natsuki&#39;s eyes as she pulled back. 
&quot;Goodbye, love,&quot; she said, &quot;call me after school, ok?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Natsuki mumbled, still entranced by the kiss. &quot;See you later,&quot; 
she added as she made her way to the door. With one last look back at 
Shizuru she left the room to go downstairs.

The driver was waiting for her in the foyer. &quot;Ready to go?&quot; he asked 
her as she approached.

She nodded and followed him out to the car where he let her into the 
backseat. The ride to school passed without incident. Natsuki was so lost 
in thought she barely noticed when they pulled up to Fuuka Academy, 
coming out of her daydream only when the car came to a stop. The driver 
walked around to her door and opened it so she could exit the car.

As she was about to walk away, he stopped her and said, &quot;I was 
instructed to give this to you by Mr. Fujino.&quot;

Natsuki looked down and saw that he was handing her an envelope. When 
she took it from him he tipped his hat and got back in the car, driving 
off. What could this be? Deciding to open it once she got to her desk, 
she started heading towards the school.

Once in class, she saw that she still had a few minutes before the 
lesson started so she got out the envelope and opened it. She unfolded the 
paper and read:

Ms. Natsuki Kuga,

Mrs. Fujino and I enjoyed our dinner with you last 
evening, but I&#39;m afraid that is not the subject of 
this letter. It has come to our attention that you 
have become involved in an elicit relationship with 
our daughter that exceeds the boundaries of an 
appropriate friendship. This knowledge has left me 
greatly vexed, and I feel I must put an end to this 
matter before serious damage is done. I forbid you 
from seeing or contacting my daughter again in the 
name of her and our family&#39;s best interests. If you 
care about my daughter&#39;s future, you will respect my 
wishes. Surely you must realize the negative impact 
this relationship could have on the Fujino name if 
it were to become public. I will not have such a 
disaster occur as a result of young foolishness. I 
trust you will make the correct choice so that I will 
not have to make it for you.

Please destroy this letter once you have finished 
reading it so that it does not fall into the wrong hands.

-Mr. Fujino

Natsuki stared at the letter in shock after she finished reading it. 
Her heart was pounding in her ears and her stomach felt like it had 
twisted into a knot. She couldn&#39;t form a coherent thought and she felt 
like she was going to be sick.

&quot;Hey, Kuga-san, are you alright?&quot; a fellow classmate asked.

She turned to him in a daze, not even registering what he had said.

&quot;You look really pale, maybe you should go see the nurse,&quot; someone else 
said.

Standing up from her desk, she wordlessly walked toward the door and 
down the hall to the bathroom. Going to a sink, she splashed water on her 
face, and that managed to bring her back to her senses. Immediately, 
countless questions flashed through her mind.

How did he find out? Was someone listening to us? Does Shizuru know 
about this yet? What the hell am I going to do now?...

Shaking her head she told herself: Ok, I need to think logically. First 
I&#39;ll call Shizuru and see if she knows about any of this.

She pulled out her cell phone and called Shizuru&#39;s cell; there was no 
answer. That&#39;s strange, she thought, surely they wouldn&#39;t have taken 
away her cell phone...

The bell to begin first period rang so Natsuki ran back to class, her 
mind still in overdrive. She decided to go to Shizuru&#39;s house after 
school and see if she could get into contact with her. Shizuru&#39;s parents 
weren&#39;t in town for today at least, maybe it wouldn&#39;t be too hard.

The rest of the day passed, and when school let out she got a ride home 
with a classmate to her apartment. She then hopped on her motorcycle 
and quickly made her way over to Shizuru&#39;s. The gate was closed so she 
used the call box.

&quot;May I ask your name and the purpose of your visit?&quot; a male voice asked 
after she pressed the button.

&quot;This is Natsuki Kuga and I&#39;m here to talk with Shizuru, please.&quot;

&quot;Ah, I&#39;m sorry, but Ms. Fujino has expressed that she does not wish to 
see you anymore. As such, I cannot let you into the estate.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s bullshit! What&#39;s happened to Shizuru? If she&#39;s been shut up in 
this house against her will someone&#39;s going to be sorry!&quot;

&quot;That is not of your concern. Please leave now.&quot;

Furious, Natsuki throttled her bike and began riding around the 
perimeter of the estate, trying to find another way in. Maybe there was a 
back entrance somewhere? The walls were about 10 feet high all around 
with steel spires running along the top, so climbing the wall was out of 
the question. When she got to the back of the estate, she noticed a 
small, gated service entrance. It also appeared to operate by way of a 
call box, so she was going to have to sneak in somehow. The best time to 
attempt such a feat would be at night and it wasn&#39;t going to be dark for 
a couple more hours.

As she rode off to kill some time and to plan out her infiltration of 
the Fujino estate, Natsuki realized she hadn&#39;t even thought twice about 
doing such a reckless thing. If it was for the sake of Shizuru, she 
would do anything. Just thinking that her friend might be suffering in 
any way made her want to take the house by storm, without regard for the 
consequences. But, she knew she&#39;d have a better chance of actually 
getting to Shizuru if she acted covertly, so covertly she would act.

Going to a gas station, she topped off her motorcycle before stopping 
at a nearby caf&eacute;. There, she formulated a plan for sneaking in. It was 
definitely not failsafe, but it was the best she could come up with.

Before long, it was time to get going. Pushing her fears and doubts to 
the back of her mind, Natsuki hopped on her bike and made her way off 
into the night.</pre>
