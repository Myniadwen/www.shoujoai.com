<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s  notes</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This is  essentially a one-shot chapter, in fulfillment of my promise to make  good on the Shizuru/Natsuki situation that I’ve been avoiding.  I’ll fill in the rest of this chapter in the next chapter.  For  now, enjoy!</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In this  chapter, Shizuru refers to Natsuki as “Miss Kuga” several times.  Take this as the English translation of the formal “Kuga-san,”  rather than a stern mother or an amused old woman at your church.  Er, her church.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No, yours.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>We  started following a certain description / we started simple and fair  / once again / before there wasn’t any need for an answer / things  were much different then</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Now you  question who I am / now there’s nothing left to hide</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So here  it goes.</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My Letter  #3</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reflecting  on it later, Natsuki Kuga judged the walk back to the van to be among  the longest point-one-six miles of her life. Time flies when you’re  having fun, but that doesn’t mean it can’t slow to a crawl, too.  Really, Natsuki had always merely judged that time tended to pass  more quickly when one wasn’t paying attention to it; subsequently,  life moved very slowly for that particular girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  and Shizuru ascended the stairs, walking past Shizuru’s former  captor as Natsuki did her damnedest to avoid looking him in the eye;  he didn’t try hard to discourage her, either, having locked onto  what may have been the most fascinating dust bunny on the face of the  planet as they walked past him.  They went through the kitchen, and  out the door into the hallway.  The shotgun was, indeed, halfway  under the sofa, and as Shizuru started to look towards the staircase  which led to the second floor, Natsuki took her hand gently, squeezed  it, shook her head.  Shizuru nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As they  moved past this, Natsuki took a look at where she’d shot Nayo; he  was still on the staircase, halfway-slumped and halfway plastered to  it, slick and a little bit crusty with his own rapidly-drying blood.  There was no doubt in anyone’s mind that he was dead.  The axe he  had been wielding had flown out of his hands when she shot him and lodged  itself in the wall above the staircase; only the hilt was visible to  Natsuki.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  turned her head away from it and kept walking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  walked past the shattered window, and Shizuru said, with a little  grin on her face, “Did you do that, Miss Kuga?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki’s  eyes widened a little; a sign of her shock at Shizuru’s sudden use  of relatively formal language.  She wondered briefly if this was what  Shizuru was like when she was angry, and nodded in reply to the  question.  “Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Clever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  kept walking. Out the door, which had been thrown open<br />
      <em>in a  panic fleeing for his life before i kill him</em><br />
  by  somebody, probably after Natsuki had entered.  There were large,  though barely visible, footprints on the brown, crunchy grass, and,  near the edge of the property, a foot-sized divot and a section of  flattened grass that was roughly the size of a man.  Natsuki took it  in automatically, and as Shizuru let go of her hand, she wished  briefly and very, very privately that she couldn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  grass was very dry that day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  walked down the stairs together, onto the lawn. The grass <em>crunched </em>under their feet—<em>How did I move so silently before? </em>Natsuki wondered,  and then stopped moving, suddenly overcome in a kind of dazed  curiosity.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Very,  very carefully, she rose up so that she was on the balls of her feet.   She lifted her left foot, and slid it down at an angle as close as  she could manage to the angle the grass was at.  It slid through with  barely a whisper.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She had  done it completely automatically before. Shizuru stopped as well, and  that horrible smile was back.  “Marveling at your own ability, Miss  Kuga?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  Natsuki said quietly.  “I’m not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  the hell is your problem, Natsuki? You’ve killed people before;  this was nothing new.  Hell, you’ve killed them more viciously than  this, too.  An icicle in the throat isn’t a fun way to go out; it’s  a hell of a lot worse than</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">corner  of his head explodes backwards the stairs behind him stained with  things thicker than blood</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>being  shot in the head with a forty-five. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Miss  Kuga?” Shizuru gently pried.  “Don’t you think we should be  getting back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  call me that.” Natsuki was staring at the ground, her hands  clutched together in fists tight enough to crush a rock.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Excuse  me?” Shizuru’s voice was more than a little bit dangerous. So was  the lady who possessed it, but she kept that to herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  said, don’t call me that. I just killed somebody for you, so don’t  call me that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Having  a resurgence of humanity, Natsuki?” There was no trace of mockery  in her voice, but Natsuki felt as though she heard it anyway.  She  didn’t care.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Yes!</em>” Her voice started to shake.  “Yes I <em>am</em>, dammit.  I can’t get the image of  that man out of my head.&quot;  She took a breath. &quot;I can’t reconcile the me that’s  standing here with the me that walked into that house and shot a man,  and broke another man’s arm and barely batted an eyelash from the  effort, alright? Is <em>that </em>what you want to hear?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think it is,” Shizuru whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Looking  far, far into the future, Natsuki would someday, privately muse that  it took only four little words to completely, utterly alter the  course of her life.  Even if it was far <em>ipso-facto. </em> At the  moment, those four little words simply rammed into her, hammering her  chest, her throat, her head, her stomach, each one of them stinging  in it’s own way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Fuck</em> you!” Natsuki shouted, less furious than bitter at Shizuru’s  sudden hefty dose of hypocrisy.  “<em>Fuck </em>you!  You can’t  even <em>talk </em>about humanity! You’ve killed more people than I  have! You just…just…” she trailed off, took a step back, losing  her thread as quickly as she’d gained it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fuck  me,” Shizuru finished.  “I’m aware.  Am I being cruel, Miss  Kuga?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,”  Natsuki whispered.  The newfound physical distance between them from  her newer, lower vantage point seemed suddenly amplified. “Wh…”  her throat locked up, and it took a moment for it to clear. “Why  are you…why are you rubbing this…”<br />
      <em>in my  face why are you rubbing the people i killed in my face</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Haven’t  you been cruel to me for a long time now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…”  Natsuki understood about a second before she said it. <em>She  doesn’t care about the deaths.  Not really.  That’s not even kind  of what this is about.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>This  is about the question. She’s being cruel because she’s angry at  me for </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Haven’t  you been avoiding my question? Haven’t you been, not accepting or  rejecting my feelings for you, nor even ignoring them, but  merely…postponing them?  At every chance you get?  ‘I don’t  know yet’, you say.  ‘I can’t trust you yet.’”  As she said  this last one, her voice became something indefinably horrible for a  moment.  “I don’t know what you want from me.  I don’t know  what I can do to make you trust me.  Tell me, Natsuki.  Do you need <em>me </em>to kill somebody for <em>you</em>? Is that it? Will violence  be what will make you trust me? Or something else? <em>Tell me.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She  rampaged over first district instead of me<br />
  and  she doesn’t understand.<br />
  She  killed<br />
  me<br />
  many  people<br />
  and  she doesn’t understand.<br />
  So  tell her, Natsuki. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  tested her legs.  They didn’t work particularly well.  She tested her voice.  It caught in her throat a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Good  enough.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  don’t understand at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I </em>don’t understand? <em>Me?</em>” Shizuru laughed again, as  horrible as her smile had been a moment before.  “You, who can’t  get over eighty small, <em>indescribably </em>minuscule deaths at my  hands half a year ago? You, who not ten minutes ago shot a man?  Did  you think anything of that, Natsuki, when you did it? Anything at  all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  took another step back. <em>She doesn’t…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>she</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  don’t understand.” It came out a lot weaker than she’d  intended.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  explain it to me, Miss Kuga.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  told you not to call me that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Silence  between them for a moment. Natsuki tested her legs again, and this  time, she found she could use them.  “You killed people, but some  of those people were my friends, and…and one of them was me. I  don’t want you to talk to me about killing people.  Not after you…”  she trailed off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  looked away.  “I told you I was sorry about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She  doesn’t understand.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So  tell her, Natsuki.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not about <em>sorry</em>, Shizuru.  It’s not about me forgiving you.  You want forgiveness? Fine. I forgive you.”  She scoffed.  “Did  that make anything better?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  couldn’t think of anything to say to that, so Natsuki said it for  her. “It’s not about that at all.  It’s about <em>I. don’t.  know. </em>It’s about seeing you ki-ki…” she took a moment to  steady her tongue.  “Kill those people, every time I look at you.  It’s not something I can control, Shizuru. It’s just me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  say no,” Shizuru murmured. “If that’s how it is, then say no to  me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  Natsuki said without meaning to.  Shizuru looked up at her, and  Natsuki, having said it already, was forced to press valiantly onward  with that on her back.  “I’m not ready to make a decision.  Not  at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  say <em>something.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  won’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  took a deep breath.  “Because if I said something now, it would be  no.  If I say something later…I don’t know what it will be.  If  you want to…” <em>really love me </em>“know, you’ll have to  wait.” <em>Please. Wait. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  long?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  is cruel, Natsuki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  did her best to smile.  “I’m sorry, Shizuru.  I’m really not  trying to be cruel.” The attempt was mediocre, at best.   “I just…I  can’t. Not yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  need more time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  sighed.  “This is where we always end up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  frowned. “I guess it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  stood in silence, and as if to fill it, Natsuki’s head immediately  became something of a battlefield, that cynical little voice in the  back of her mind using the empty space to challenge her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Always  where you end up, </em>it said.<em> What are you planning on doing,  Natsuki? Are you going to make her wait until the end of time? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No! </em>She felt a little strange, defending herself against herself; but  she would have felt worse if she hadn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  are you planning, then?<br />
  I  just need more time.<br />
  You  know that’s a lie.<br />
  It’s  not!<br />
  You  don’t need any more time.  What you need is a hell of a lot more  courage.<br />
  I  don’t need courage to tell Shizuru my feelings.  I don’t trust  her!<br />
  Because  you’re scared of her. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  was staring at Natsuki by this point—the girl had lapsed into  complete silence, and was staring straight ahead, face completely  blank.  This, coincidentally, puther eyes roughly in line  with Shizuru’s set of weaponry, far more deadly, in many ways, than  the Mark-23 that Natsuki had tucked into the holster under her shirt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I am  not! I’m not afraid of her!<br />
  Then,  why don’t you trust her? We distrust people we’re afraid will  hurt us.<br />
  We  don’t trust strangers, </em>Natsuki countered, feeling she’d  claimed the upper hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  why not? Because they might be perverts or rapists. </em>Niggle: 1.  Natsuki: 0. Really, Natsuki didn’t want to admit to anybody, least  of all to herself, that she was really, genuinely afraid of Shizuru.  She was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  can I do, though? I can’t…I just can’t…not yet.<br />
  The  current only changes when we decide it should change.  This river is </em>yours<em>.  Change it whenever you want to. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For  a moment, Natsuki wanted to shout back at the voice.  To go on the  offensive, to accuse <em>it </em>of something, <em>anything.</em> She  wasn’t used to this. She didn’t know how to deal with it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Then  do something about it.  It’s your river. Do whatever you want with  it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Natsuki?”   Shizuru had dropped the icy little edge beneath her tone, and she  sounded genuinely concerned at this point—any happiness she might  have experienced at Natsuki’s apparent point of focus, or unfocus,  as the case may be—had faded into worry when she had moved them and  just Natsuki kept right on staring.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Your  river.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  looked up at Shizuru and smiled half-heartedly as though nothing had  happened.  “I guess we really do end up here every time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Your  river.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  nodded, a little puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  change the current.<br />
  You  change it.<br />
  You…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  can change the fucking current whenever you want to.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  caught Shizuru’s gaze, as gently as she could; it wasn’t hard to  do, in any event, as she’d done it often enough, but this time…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She took  a step forward, and this time, it was Shizuru’s turn to be a little  frightened. The taller girl’s feet grew roots all of a sudden,  started drawing nutrition from the ground, and Shizuru wanted no part  of anything else at that point.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Just  reach out your hands.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  did.  She reached for Shizuru, who, for a moment, didn’t know what  to do.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then she  reached back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>When  I didn’t trust anybody, you made me trust you.<br />
  When  I didn’t know where to go, you pointed there.<br />
  You  helped me.  Every time.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  pulled Shizuru into a hug; tight, firm, warm, and after a moment, she  whispered, “Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  could have sworn she heard Shizuru sniffing next to her ear, but that  could have just as easily been the sound of the waves of the river,  lapping up on the shore as it changed directions.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After a  while, Shizuru pulled back.  It could have been minutes as easily as  it could have been hours in Natsuki’s mind, which had lost most of  its sense of time in a flurry of relief; the kind of relief that a  man working overtime at a grueling job experiences after his shift  finally ends.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  was ready to go now.  She felt better.  She felt <em>good</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru,  however, was not.  She was looking straight-on at Natsuki, and she  had the kind of look in her eye…the eye that was moving closer,  nervously but steadily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  immediate response was, <em>oh, shit. </em>It was the kind of response  you got from months of conditioning.  The kind of reaction that would  make a man run from what he, in an instant of what could have as  easily been infatuation as love, perceived to be the love of his life  because he was already married.  A flash of sensibility, but at the  same time, cowardice.  Whether it was for the best was down to  anybody’s opinion who wanted to speak on it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But that  meant that Natsuki had hers, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m  not ready yet, Shizuru.  I’m not sure if I’ll ever be ready.<br />
  But I  think, this once, I can do something I’m afraid to do. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  way some tell it, dating canon states that a man should move ninety  percent of the way in for a kiss, allowing the woman enough space to  reject him comfortably, or accept him without much effort.  It was a  formula that worked fairly well for many males, worked poorly for  others, notably those whose dental hygiene is less than spectacular.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  instance, however; this location, this couple, this time frame, was  utterly unique in the world.  Maybe that was the explanation for the  pissing on of the canon. Maybe it was that there were no males  involved.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or maybe  it was because Natsuki Kuga would not be only ten percent. Ever.  She  leaned in at least fifty percent, and captured Shizuru’s mouth,  moving slowly, shaking slightly, with her own, also shaking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  kissed.  Their lips pressed against each other, one pair warm and  moist, the other dry.  Their respiration virtually ceased.  Natsuki’s  eyes were closed, Shizuru’s wide open for a moment as she allowed  herself to relax.  When her eyes closed, she parted her lips  slightly, slid them across Natsuki’s as she tilted her head to  avoid a bumping of noses.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  reciprocated her motion, and their kiss became more involved for all  of twenty seconds.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  grass was very dry that day.  It crunched behind Shizuru, in front of  Natsuki, and their kiss ended as Natsuki opened her eyes and drew her  gun in the same instinctive motion, bred into her personality by  years of<br />
      <em>violence  is this really me when I’m with Shizuru like this</em><br />
  paranoia.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She had  her weapon trained directly on Minoru Alder, who froze.  He had his  backpack, and his camouflage was open at the collar, revealing a  black sweater.</span></p>
