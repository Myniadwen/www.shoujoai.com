<a href="../maihime/letter4u-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>FROM THE PERSONAL JOURNAL OF KIKUKAWA YUKINO:

9/13-- Nakajima-san came to see me today. He said my new system designs 
were approved. At this rate I&#39;ll get a promotion with a raise soon. I 
should be thrilled. 

9/14-- I finally got a break tonight. These all-nighters are taking 
their toll. At work I&#39;m edgy and at night I&#39;m restless. I should eat a 
better diet than coffee in the mornings and pre-packaged meals at 
night. 

But what would be the point of that?

9/15-- One of my co-workers, Saori-san invited me to a goukon. She said 
they needed to raise the intelligence quotient of their group. The 
girls are all friendly and easygoing, however I just don&#39;t feel 
comfortable around them. I don&#39;t feel like a part of their world.

9/16-- I made my apologies to Saori-san and the others and declined 
their offer. They seemed to believe my excuses about finishing this 
project early. I think I&#39;m just better off alone right now.

And Mikoto-chan called.

9/17-- I was planning to take it easy on my day off. Maybe go to the 
gym for a workout. But Mikoto-chan showed up and we ended up goofing off 
all day. I can&#39;t believe how much I&#39;ve missed her. She&#39;s turned into 
such a beautiful young lady. We saw a movie, did some shopping and went 
to my favorite ice cream shop. It&#39;s been so long since I did something 
that was just for fun.

9/18--  Seeing Mikoto-chan like that really took me back. I remember 
our time at Fuuka the best. Even with all of that craziness, I count it 
as the happiest time of my life. With everyone on the student council, 
Mai-san, Kuga-san and the other HiMEs, and...Haruka-chan.

9/24-- That last entry suddenly made me think of things I didn&#39;t want 
to remember for some time. Haruka-chan. I hope you&#39;re doing well. I 
know my feelings could never be returned so I promised myself not to 
contact her anymore. I want to remember our friendship as it was. 
Why am I writing this as if anyone will see this? Mikoto-chan&#39;s 
calling. 

9/25-- Mikoto told me why she&#39;s been spending so much time in this 
city. She plans to transfer to the university here to finish her 
veterinary science degree. When I asked her why she&#39;d want to move so far 
away from Mai-san, she just shook her head and said it was just time. 

10/02-- Saori-san asked me if something good happened to me lately. 
When I asked why, she said I seemed so much more at ease lately.
I wonder...

10/10-- Anniversary. The day Haruka-chan asked me to join the 
Excecutive committee. I remember how she took me by the hand and led me 
to the school roof. She looked into my eyes and told me Fuuka Gakuen 
needed me. And furthermore SHE needed me. Haruka-chan; beautiful, 
talented, and from a from a wealthy and prestegious family needed ME. 

10/12-- I spent another day with Mikoto-chan. It was wrong of me to try 
and revive old times with her. I&#39;d like to place my hopes in something 
new. Also, I seriously considered asking her to spend the night. 
But that felt like a betrayal. Why?</pre>
