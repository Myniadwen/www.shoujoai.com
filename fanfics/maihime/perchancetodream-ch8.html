<h1>Perchance to Dream (part 8 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leebot.html">Leebot</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/perchancetodream-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><p>Magic Hands</p><hr><i>You’re so
beautiful, Shizuru. I can completely understand now why you love
watching me sleep so much. You look so precious while you’re doing
it. You’re so serene, so peaceful. Your face is a mask of perfect
beauty right now, and the smile on it is one of the cutest I’ve
ever seen on you. And I put it there, didn’t I?</i><p><i>I’m willing to bet
you had much the same effect on me while I slept last night. I know
my dreams were certainly a lot more peaceful than usual. You already
know about one of them, but the others were just as fun. That
nightmare I mentioned didn’t pop up at all. I don’t think I’m
over it permanently, but sleeping with you like this at least pushed
it from my mind for one night.</i></p><p><i>We’ll have to deal
with that soon. Maybe today would be a good chance, if we’re just
going to focus on us and our relationship today. Though I guess we
might need a chance to buy some, er, supplies for it… Ugh, okay,
maybe that wasn’t such a good idea. Okay, new plan: I bring up the
issue with you somehow, maybe by showing you this journal – I did
promise last night to let you know all about me, so it’s probably
time to let you in on this – and suffer through however much
teasing it takes to get you to go out and get them yourself.</i></p><p><i>Bleh, I’m really
not that good at this scheming. You always seem to make it look so
effortless. But then again, you make pretty much everything look
effortless. Even last night, when I’d thought it would be a
near-impossible task for you to get me to open myself up completely
to you, you’d turned me into jelly in your arms before I’d
finished reading your letters. The only time I’ve ever seen you
sweat was when I was, er… you know… to you.</i></p><p><i>Hmm, for some reason
that thought is rather enticing. And seeing you lying there, sleeping
so beautifully, your bare breasts heaving with every breath… Gah! I
really have to learn to control myself. I’m not used to having all
these urges. You must think I’m some sort of sex maniac with the
way I’ve been going after you the past week. I even ended up
molesting you in my sleep! I’m definitely falling in love with you,
Shizuru. I know I already said I loved you, but it looks like there’s
further to fall.</i></p><p><i>Oh yes, that reminds
me, I’ve been thinking a bit about nicknames and such, after you
pointed out my muttering of “Zuru” last night. While that one’s
good for when I’m sleepy and can’t get out the “shi,” I think
I need something a little better for you. In one of my dreams last
night, I used something for you which I think is just perfect.
Hopefully it’ll get a little flutter in your heart whenever you
hear it.</i></p><p><i>Anyways, I’m going
to be off to shower and freshen up now. We’ll of course talk later,
and hopefully I’ll remember to let you read this today, if you
aren’t too distracting.</i></p><p>---</p><p>Natsuki closed up her
journal and slipped it into her “hiding place” under her bed. It
was neither the most inventive hiding place nor the most secure, but
she’d never really been that concerned about it being found out.
She had the dorm to herself – at least until the fall term hit and
more students started needing rooms – and Shizuru was the only one
likely to be snooping around, which wasn’t really much of a
concern.</p><p>Natsuki gave her
girlfriend another glance before she got off of the bed. She really
was extraordinarily beautiful, especially in her sleep. Deciding that
she just couldn’t resist any longer, Natsuki tentatively bent her
face down to just in front of Shizuru’s. She wanted to let her
girlfriend remain sleeping peacefully, but she just couldn’t go any
longer without kissing those precious lips. But she’d ended up
waking Shizuru when she’d done that last week, so she resolved to
try to be gentle right now and just give her a quick kiss, rather
than start making out with her.</p><p>It was harder than
she’d expected, but Natsuki managed it. She let her lips come in
contact with Shizuru’s lightly, gave a little suction to make sure
it qualified as a kiss, and gently withdrew. The feeling of Shizuru’s
soft, sweet lips made Natsuki wish she could stick around to relish
them some more, but she resisted the urge. Shizuru could use the
sleep so she could be fully energized for the day ahead of them.</p><p>Giving the object of
her affection a small smile, Natsuki whispered to her, “Sleep well,
love. You’ll need the rest to deal with your sex maniac of a
girlfriend today.” Natsuki chuckled lightly to herself as she left
for the bathroom. The nickname of “love” certainly felt right,
though describing herself as a sex maniac definitely didn’t. <i>I’m
just in love, and trying to deal with a suddenly unleashed libido,</i>

Natsuki tried to justify to herself. <i>Besides, it’s partly
Shizuru’s fault anyways for being so damn sexy!</i></p><p>She let out a sigh and
shook her head as she made her way into the bathroom. She stood in
front of the mirror for a bit, trying to look at her naked body as
Shizuru saw her. Although her breasts weren’t quite as big as her
girlfriend’s, they still were a fair bit larger than average. They
also seemed to be just about the perfect size to fit with the curves
of the rest of her body, she reluctantly noted.</p><p>Natsuki had done quite
a lot of work keeping herself in shape, and it showed. Her muscles
weren’t very prominent, but they were quite firm, and they seemed
to flow into the natural curves of her body perfectly, without making
her look too masculine. She turned around so she could look over her
shoulder to inspect her backside in the mirror. Shizuru hadn’t seen
her naked from that angle yet, so she wanted to make sure she’d
appreciate it.</p><p>Trying to imagine that
she was looking at the body of someone other than herself –<i>Shizuru</i>, her subconscious 
immediately suggested – Natsuki
tried to judge just how sexy she looked from this angle. As soon as
she superimposed Shizuru’s face over her reflection, a wave of heat
erupted from her loins, answering her question in no uncertain terms.
She turned back to give the front of her own body the same test, and
the result was even more definite.</p><p>So that was it then;
she was sexy, whether she’d ever admit it or not. And yet Shizuru
had done an incredible job of resisting her so far. Did the girl just
not care about sex that much? It didn’t seem to fit in with how she
pictured Shizuru. She’d certainly taken full advantage of the
little opportunities she’d had in the past to push the limits with
Natsuki. But she was holding herself back a lot better now.</p><p>She’d probably had to
hold herself back a lot before they’d gotten together, even though
she’d slipped up on a couple of occasions. <i>I guess Shizuru’s
just good at holding herself back,</i> Natsuki mused. <i>She
certainly does that with her emotions most of the time when we aren’t
alone together. So it probably isn’t very hard for her to hold
herself back from jumping on me. And she did have a good reason to
last week, wanting to make my first time as perfect as possible.</i></p><p>Natsuki smiled to
herself. Shizuru had certainly succeeded last night. She resolved to
herself to thank her girlfriend for that when she woke up, and maybe
even give her a little reward. She would have to be submissive for
this reward, however, to make sure Shizuru didn’t keep worrying
about holding herself back. The gates were open now for the two of
them to try out whatever they wanted with each other now; Natsuki
just hoped Shizuru would start to take advantage of it.</p><p>Giving her arms a nice
stretch, Natsuki walked over to the shower, leaned in, and started
the water. She waited a few seconds for the water to warm up before
she walked into it and drew the curtain behind her. The flood of
water over her body was nice, but she couldn’t help but compare it
to the feeling of Shizuru embracing her. Needless to say, the water
came up far behind.</p><p>Natsuki let out a sigh
as she dipped her head back to wet her hair in the stream of water.
She’d barely been apart from Shizuru for five minutes, and already
her thoughts were finding any excuse possible to drift back to her.
She really needed to get used to spending time apart from her
girlfriend. The problem was, she just didn’t want to. She still
wished she could spend even more time with Shizuru. It was going to
be torture come tomorrow evening when they’d both be forced to
retire to their own homes.</p><p>Natsuki paused in her
motions as her mind started to converse with itself, disconnecting
from reality around her. <i>But does it really have to be that way?
Why can’t I just stay over at Shizuru’s house – or have her
stay here – and just make sure I set the alarm or something to get
up early enough for class? I’m sure Shizuru would understand, and
she’d probably prefer being woken up a bit early to not having me
there.</i></p><p><i>No, wait,</i> her
mind countered back. <i>Wouldn’t that mean you’re living together
then? You can’t do that this soon! You’re still barely a couple.</i></p><p><i>Barely? We’re 
in
love with each other and we’ve repeatedly made love to each other.
And I can’t possibly imagine our relationship changing. Besides, it
doesn’t really have to be official or anything. It can just be that
I sleep over with her often, and I can keep the dorm if I need it.</i></p><p><i>Oh come on! 
What
happened to being afraid to rely on anyone else? You know that
everyone else has just left you. Your mother betrayed you and ended
up getting killed for it, and your father abandoned you to just send
money in place of any actual love. You can’t go leading yourself
into that kind of pain again; your heart just won’t take it.</i></p><p><i>Oh, fuck you!</i>

she cursed the voice in her head. <i>Shizuru doesn’t count, and you
damn well know that. I tried things your way for years, and I just
ended up holding myself back from happiness and hurting others. I
thought I’d finally gotten rid of in the Carnival when I was able
to accept Shizuru’s feelings, but if I have to kill you off now, I
will. I’ll show you a thing or two. I’m going to allow myself to
trust Shizuru and rely on her. There is no way I’m letting you hold
me back from moving in with her.</i></p><p>No reply was
forthcoming, and Natsuki allowed herself a small victorious smile as
she came back to the real world. She turned around to pick up the
shampoo, but the sight of a shadowy figure behind the curtain sent a
shock through her body. She let out a cry of alarm and jolted in
surprise as her arms instinctively shot up to cover her body. In the
moment before Shizuru drew the curtain and stepped into the shower
with her, Natsuki had just enough time to muse about how her
instincts had her worrying more about modesty than defense, as they
would have just a few weeks ago.</p><p>“Ara ara,” Shizuru
said as she came into the shower. She made no effort at all to hide
her body as she allowed the water to drift down over her – she even
seemed to relish showing it off to Natsuki. Natsuki found herself
instinctively backing away to make room for her girlfriend, though
there was barely enough in there for the two of them to stand
comfortably. “Natsuki is so cute when she’s all flustered and
modest.”</p><p>Natsuki pressed herself
back against the wall and tightened her grasp of her body as
Shizuru’s lustful gaze bore into her. She focused her gaze directly
downwards to try to hide the blush she knew was forming in her face.
“Baka…” she said weakly. “You really should learn to knock,
Shizuru…”</p><p>“Ara?” Shizuru
said. “But it’s not like Natsuki has anything left to hide from
me. I’ve already seen all the best bits of her, and I can see them
again anytime I wish just by closing my eyes.” Shizuru paused for a
moment. “Ah yes, there we go. Ara… so beautiful and sexy…”</p><p>Natsuki shrunk even
further under Shizuru’s teasing. She could feel that her blush had
completely filled her face by now and was leaking its way down her
neck and into her chest. She’d been fine with Shizuru seeing her
last night, and even a few minutes ago when she was imagining it, but
under the barrage of her teasing, it was just too much.</p><p><i>Baka. I told you
that you couldn’t do it. How do expect to be able to live with her
when you can’t even bear being casually naked around her? You know
she’s going to be doing this every single day if you live together.</i></p><p><i>Quiet 
you,</i>
Natsuki reprimanded the voice in her head. A wave of determination
hit her to prove that voice wrong. Taking a breath to steel herself,
she slowly moved her arms away from her body to expose it to Shizuru.
With another breath, she tilted her head back up to face Shizuru,
prepared to endure having her body lustily appraised by her
girlfriend.</p><p>It turned out that she
didn’t have to, though. Shizuru was gazing straight back into her
eyes. The look on her face seemed to mix relief and pride. After a
moment it softened into an expression that Natsuki recognized as her
“Natsuki is too sweet” expression, though she didn’t utter the
words now. The sight of it made pride swell up within Natsuki.
Pleasing Shizuru had just topped the list of goals for her life, she
realized.</p><p>Now that the stun from
Shizuru walking in on her had worn off, Natsuki realized something
else as well: Shizuru was doing just what she’d been worried about
a few minutes ago, making the first move towards her. Sure, it had
been in a teasing manner, but what did she really suspect with
Shizuru? But she’d started to slow down to match Natsuki’s pace
now – she’d just been standing patiently under the water as
Natsuki adjusted to being in the shower with her.</p><p><i>Always waiting for
me. Well, I’m here now, Shizuru. You can stop waiting.</i> Natsuki
pushed herself off from the wall and walked up to Shizuru, not
stopping until her body was pressed right up against her lover’s.
She wrapped her hands around the back of Shizuru’s neck and pulled
the girl’s face in to meet her lips. Shizuru’s hands soon found
their way around her back to hold their bodies together even more
tightly.</p><p>Everything was softness
in Natsuki’s world as they shared that kiss. Maybe it was the steam
coming up from the shower, but Shizuru’s lips seemed to be even
softer and sweeter than they usually were. Natsuki dragged her lips
over her lover’s to relish all the sensations from them as a gentle
warmth built up in her chest.</p><p>The feeling of the rest
of Shizuru’s body against hers was just the icing on the cake. The
water flowing down over Shizuru’s shoulders cascaded between their
bodies, and it seemed to make Shizuru’s breasts even smoother and
softer than usual. Natsuki had to resist the urge to bring a hand
down from Shizuru’s neck to feel them, but she didn’t want to
escalate things quite yet – she was still hoping Shizuru would be
the one to do that – so she contented herself with the feeling of
them pressed up against her own breasts.</p><p>As she was about to run
low on air, Natsuki pulled her head off to the side, regretfully
breaking the kiss. A smile tugged at her lips when she heard a soft
moan come from Shizuru – oh, how she’d allowed herself to open up
emotionally since they’d become a couple! Natsuki had no intention
of moving away, though, and she rested her head on Shizuru’s
shoulder. Shizuru’s own head followed her example after only a
second.</p><p>After a few moments of
relishing the embrace, Natsuki decided it was time to speak up and
get some of her thoughts out to her girlfriend. She started out
simply. “Thank you, Shizuru,” she said.</p><p>“For what, Natsuki?”
Shizuru’s tone of voice fortunately didn’t hold the tone of guilt
it might have had, thinking that she’d done nothing worth being
thanked for. It was more along the lines of being curious as to what
exactly Natsuki had in mind with her thanks.</p><p>“For everything,”
Natsuki explained. She allowed her hands to drift down Shizuru’s
body, and she started lightly stroking her girlfriend’s back. The
water running down from it made it so smooth and pleasant to the
touch. “But particularly last night. It was just perfect, better
than I’d ever imagined. I’ll always cherish that memory, and the
fact that I could share my first time with you, who I also plan to
share my last time with.”</p><p>Shizuru’s arms
clenched tighter around Natsuki as she uttered the last words. She
knew she might have been looking too far into the future, being more
certain than was warranted, but she didn’t care. At that moment she
couldn’t imagine ever being with anyone other than Shizuru. After a
moment, Shizuru replied, her voice straining with glee, “Ara,
Natsuki…”</p><p>“Also, Shizuru,”
Natsuki continued, “thank you for this. Please don’t be afraid to
push me a little, make the first move. I need it sometimes if we’re
going to move forwards. There are a few things that will still be
hard for me, but I’ll let you know then. Don’t you dare worry in
advance. You need to be the adventurous one; I just don’t think
I’ll be able to handle more than the rare burst of inspiration.”</p><p>Shizuru was silent 
for
a bit. Eventually, she withdrew her hands from around Natsuki’s
back and lightly pushed herself out of the hug. She looked directly
into Natsuki’s eyes, as if scanning them for any trace of hesitance
or deceit. “Natsuki really wants this?”</p><p>“Of course I do,
love,” Natsuki said, letting a smile cross her face and seep into
her eyes. She’d slipped in her new nickname to test it out what
Shizuru thought of it, and the girl’s face almost immediately lit
up. Natsuki wasn’t quite sure if it was from the nickname or the
sentiment of her statement, though. She peered into her love’s eyes
for a moment, and her instincts read the twinkle present in them as
meaning that she did indeed appreciate the nickname.</p><p>“So then,” Shizuru
said, a playful smile forming on her face which caused Natsuki’s
heart to flutter, “would Natsuki like to shower with me?”</p><p>Even if she hadn’t
already tacitly agreed to do just this, Natsuki just wouldn’t have
been able to resist Shizuru at that moment. The playful look on her
face, the hopeful tone in voice, and the nature of just what she was
requesting made it irresistible. Natsuki was barely able to hold
herself back from squealing with glee as her mind started to run wild
with what they were about to do. “You bet I would,” she said.</p><p>A giggle broke out from
Shizuru’s mouth and she clapped her hands together in glee, tilting
her head against them. Natsuki had seen her strike that pose on a
couple other occasions when she was putting on a mask of happiness,
but she wasn’t wearing any mask now – <i>or anything else for
that matter</i>, the perverted part of Natsuki’s mind reminded her.
This was simply Shizuru in a rare moment of letting her true
happiness pour out, for Natsuki’s eyes only. It was quite the
sight, and her giddiness was infectious.</p><p>“So,” Shizuru said,
a huge grin on her face, “has Natsuki shampooed yet?”</p><p>Natsuki ran her mind
back to before Shizuru had gotten into the shower. She’d frozen in
thought as she was wetting her hair, so she’d never gotten around
to shampooing. She shook her head. “Not yet.”</p><p>“Then may I?”
Shizuru asked, giving Natsuki her best puppy-dog eyes.</p><p>Natsuki had been hoping
Shizuru might go for something a bit more intimate right away, but
she did still need to wash her hair. No reason they couldn’t work
upwards, though, and she intended to make sure this shower was as
intimate as possible. “Only if I can wash your hair as well.”</p><p>This seemed to be just
the answer Shizuru was looking for. She took out her hand and
motioned for Natsuki to turn around. “Alright, but Natsuki first,
since she’s been in here longer.”</p><p>Natsuki rolled her eyes
playfully, though she obeyed Shizuru. “Yes, love.” Shizuru let
out an unconscious squeak of joy at the use of her new nickname,
leaving Natsuki with no doubts that she appreciated it.</p><p>After a moment, Natsuki
felt Shizuru’s gently meet the top of her head. They started gently
massaging her scalp, working the shampoo in. Natsuki tilted her head
back slightly to help give Shizuru a better angle and to make sure
shampoo didn’t start dripping into her eyes. Shizuru certainly took
advantage of this position, and it wasn’t long before she’d been
able to elicit a moan of pleasure from Natsuki.</p><p>It was really amazing
what Shizuru was able to do with the gentle motions of her fingers.
Ever since the incident in the lingerie store when Shizuru had nearly
brought Natsuki to orgasm while under the guise of helping her try on
a bra, Natsuki had mentally referred to them as Shizuru’s “magic
hands.” She’d feared them for quite a while, as they were one of
the few things that had been able to break through all of her
defenses, and with such ease at that.</p><p>But Shizuru had held
herself in check since that incident, and it wasn’t until a week
ago, when she’d finally decided that she loved Shizuru that she
once again experienced their touch. Of course, Shizuru had just used
them as part of her teasing then, trying to push the limits of how
much Natsuki would allow her to touch her, but they just felt too
good to ask her to stop. In the end though, Natsuki needed to make
sure the night was about Shizuru, and she’d ended up being left
wanting for more of their touch – whether she’d ever admit it
aloud or not.</p><p>And now, finally, she’d
been able to let those hands take her all the way. Shizuru was now
completely free to use them on her at will, just as she was right
now. Even though she was working on one of the least sensitive parts
of Natsuki’s body, somehow she still managed to make it a heavenly
experience. Natsuki almost didn’t want it to end, but eventually it
had to, as Shizuru had done all she could do with both the shampoo
and conditioner now. Perhaps she’d still help with rinsing out the
conditioner later, but in the meantime, Natsuki had a chance to
return the favor.</p><p>Turning back to
Shizuru, Natsuki motioned for her girlfriend to turn around as she
had. She reached for her bottle of shampoo and paused as she
considered Shizuru’s hair. “Is this brand alright with you,
Shizuru? I’m not sure quite what you use to make your hair so
soft.”</p><p>Shizuru gave off a
light chuckle. Even facing away from Natsuki and in the poor
acoustics of the shower, it still sounded unbelievably melodic. “Ara,
your shampoo is quite alright, Natsuki. And you don’t need to worry
about the conditioner, either. My hair is quite well-behaved on its
own.”</p><p>Natsuki furrowed her
brow as she squirted out shampoo and started massaging it into
Shizuru’s hair. “I’m not buying it,” she said after a bit.
“That’s just too perfect hair to be natural.”</p><p>As they talked, Natsuki
tried as hard as she could to give Shizuru the same heavenly
experience she’d been given, but she knew she was going to come up
short. She just didn’t have that miraculous knack for it that
Shizuru did. Her saving grace in her last few encounters with Shizuru
had been the other girl’s glee at the nature of the situation –
simply the fact that Natsuki was trying and was touching her like
that helped Shizuru out a lot, she was sure. She was trying her best
to improve though. She kept careful track of what felt good when
Shizuru did it, and she paid attention to what her lover seemed to
enjoy as well. Since Shizuru was likely improving at the same time,
it was unlikely she’d ever catch up, but she’d just have to find
other ways to make it up to her girlfriend.</p><p>She was likely doing
something right now, as Shizuru let out a soft moan of pleasure as
Natsuki worked in the shampoo. “Natsuki can believe whatever she
wants,” Shizuru said. “She can see for herself later today.”</p><p>“Hmph,” Natsuki
said. Shizuru certainly did have many almost-superhuman features –
her skills with her hands came particularly to mind. Was it that hard
to believe that she naturally had such lovely hair as well? “I
guess we’ll see,” she decided. Seeing that the shampoo was
lathered about as much as it was going to get, Natsuki gently prodded
Shizuru to get her to turn around so they could rinse it out.</p><p>Natsuki’s breath
caught in her throat as Shizuru turned around for her. She’d
dropped her gaze down, not thinking about what part of Shizuru’s
body she’d be facing, resulting in her ending up with an eyeful of
her love’s naked body. She’d been too distracted by her own
nudity when it was exposed to her before to pay it much attention,
but now that was off of her mind and Shizuru had helped to get her
into mood. As a result, the sight of Shizuru’s body was now adding
to the building heat within Natsuki, and she couldn’t take her eyes
away from it.</p><p>“Ara, has Natsuki
found something she likes?” Shizuru teased gently, having caught
Natsuki in the act of ogling her body.</p><p>Unfortunately for
Shizuru, Natsuki was too mesmerized to realize she was supposed to be
embarrassed and blush. “Yeah…” she said dreamily. Even
Shizuru’s laughter at her response didn’t manage to make her
blush, as it just resulted in an enchanting bouncing of her chest.</p><p>“Then maybe would
Natsuki like to help me wash that as well?” Shizuru said. It wasn’t
much of a tease, as Natsuki was more than eager to assist in that
task. The prospect of seeing that lovely body all soaped up was just
irresistible. Though maybe that was precisely Shizuru’s goal.
Natsuki decided that she didn’t care, and she quickly turned to
pick up the soap so she could get to work.</p><p>Unfortunately, Shizuru
just couldn’t help but land yet another tease. As Natsuki had
turned to grab the soap, Shizuru had turned around once again to
present her back to her girlfriend. “Ah, thank you so much,
Natsuki,” Shizuru said. “It’s so hard to reach some of the
spots back there.”</p><p>Natsuki growled softly.
She knew full well that Shizuru was playing with her, but there
wasn’t much she could do about it. An idea briefly occurred to her
when she remembered that she hadn’t helped Shizuru rinse her hair
out yet, and maybe she could get the girl to turn around for that.
But nope, Shizuru had apparently done it herself while Natsuki was
distracted with her body. She must have been planning this from the
start.</p><p>With a sigh of defeat,
Natsuki lathered the soap up between her hands and started spreading
it over Shizuru’s back. She contemplated how she could best get
back at Shizuru as she did this, but didn’t come up with anything
quite good enough. She just wasn’t a match for the teasing prowess
of the great Fujino Shizuru.</p><p>However, Natsuki did
have one other tactic up her sleeve. Shizuru wasn’t very easy to
tease, but Natsuki did have a pretty good track record when it came
to trying to get a blush out of her through quite a different method.
Natsuki gave this a try right now, allowing her fingers to gently
trace down Shizuru’s sides. A stiff gasp from the girl informed her
that she’d hit home.</p><p>Biting her lips to
stifle her laughter, Natsuki crouched down to start working on
soaping up the backs of Shizuru’s legs. She kept her movements as
slow and sensuous as possible, allowing herself to delight in the
feeling of how miraculously soft Shizuru’s muscles were. It was
amazing how their bodies worked differently. While Natsuki’s
muscles tightened up and solidified her form as she worked on them,
Shizuru’s seemed to somehow stay delightfully soft to the touch,
even though Natsuki knew from experience that they were quite
powerful.</p><p>Finally, Natsuki worked
her way up to a part of Shizuru’s body she’d been curious about
ever since she’d discovered just how delightfully soft her
girlfriend was. For both her own sake and Shizuru’s, she’d saved
it for last – at least on this side of her body. Natsuki lathered
up the soap vigorously between her hands before dropping the bar to
the floor so it wouldn’t get in her way. And then she dove in.</p><p>Shizuru let out a soft
sigh of contentment almost as soon as Natsuki grabbed her butt. If
Natsuki hadn’t been listening specifically for a sign of pleasure
from the girl, she wouldn’t have been able to hear it over the
running water. Although this was nice to hear, Natsuki was still
hoping for something a little more. She wanted to make sure Shizuru
was aroused as possible by the time she was done washing her body so
that when it was her turn she’d be in the mood to repay the favor –
and a fair bit more, Natsuki was gambling.</p><p>Natsuki wasn’t able
to catch any further signs of contentment from Shizuru by the time
she’d finished, but she acknowledged that it was possible the
sounds were just drowned out by the shower. Well, she’d be able to
work on Shizuru’s front next, and that provided ample opportunity
to work on arousing the girl. Grabbing the bar of soap off the floor,
Natsuki stood up and said, “Alright Shizuru, turn around.”</p><p>Shizuru did so, and
Natsuki saw that she’d had more of an effect on the girl than she’d
thought. She was currently straining to repress a smile, and her
cheeks were tinged pink from a blush that didn’t seem to want to go
away. Natsuki gave a mental cheer at being able to provoke this
reaction from Shizuru. She allowed a smirk to cross her face as she
brought the soap up to the top of Shizuru’s chest to see just how
much further she could push her girlfriend.</p><p>She had no idea what
happened to cause it, but Natsuki suddenly realized that not only had
the soap disappeared from her hand, but Shizuru had backed a foot
away from her. She stared blankly at her hand for a moment before
looking up at Shizuru incredulously. There was no way she could have
moved that fast. Sure, she might have been a little distracted with
her own thoughts, but not <i>that</i> distracted…</p><p>“Ara, thank you so
much for helping me with my back, Natsuki,” Shizuru said. Natsuki
shot her gaze up to Shizuru’s face and stared at her forlornly. She
knew on some level she was just being teased, but that didn’t
mitigate the fact that Shizuru had already started to work the soap
on her own chest, depriving Natsuki of the pleasure, tease or not.
“It’s always so hard to make sure I get everything back there,
and Natsuki is such a good helper.”</p><p><i>Then why couldn’t
I help with the front…?</i> Natsuki’s mouth moved silently as she
tried to form the words, but her voice just wasn’t obeying her.
Finally she was able to force out a pathetic pouting noise. Part of
her mind finally realized how pathetic she was making herself look,
resulting in a blush spreading to her face. It didn’t stop her from
keeping up the look though; it would be worth the embarrassment if
Shizuru would just relent.</p><p>“Ara? Is something
wrong, Natsuki?” Natsuki gathered enough control over her face to
glare at Shizuru. This brought her an amused smirk in return. “Ah,
I know. Natsuki was planning to help with the front as well, wasn’t
she? Natsuki is such a good helper, but I’m quite good, thank you.”</p><p>Natsuki hopefully
reached out to grab the bar of soap from Shizuru, but it slipped from
her grasp again as the girl turned to the side, provided her with a
tantalizing profile view of her lover. Letting out a low growl,
Natsuki focused for a minute so she could regain control of her
voice. “Shizuru…” she said. Her girlfriend looked over at her
and raised an eyebrow inquiringly. “Give me the soap.”</p><p>She got an amused
chuckle for this, but no soap. “Natsuki no hentai,” Shizuru
scolded. Her face remained looking off to the side, refusing to meet
Natsuki’s pleading gaze. “I figured Natsuki might have trouble
holding herself back. While I really wouldn’t mind Natsuki
finishing the job, she’s just done so much for me over the past
week that I can’t risk letting her get further ahead.”</p><p>Shizuru stopped
scrubbing herself for a minute as she continued softly, “I just
lose control of myself too easily when I feel your touch, Natsuki.”
The pink tint to her cheeks deepened as she said this, and her head
tilted downwards. “And then I’m always so weak and worn out
afterwards that I can’t think of anything beyond simply holding
you. I’ll probably be able to work my stamina up eventually, but
until then, I’m just going to have to make sure I get to Natsuki
first so I’m the one who gets the pleasure of making her girlfriend
writhe at her touch. Though I guess you do get some pleasure out of
it too, no?”</p><p>“Shizuru…”
Natsuki reached out her hand to lay it gently on Shizuru’s
shoulder. It was a relief to know that Shizuru had the intentions
she’d been hoping for, but also a little disconcerting that she’d
misread her signals. “That was really what I was going for now. I
just wanted to make sure you were in the mood for it…”</p><p>Shizuru’s blush
managed to get even deeper, and a smile crept its way across her
face. She was truly gorgeous when she blushed this much, it was just
a shame that it was so hard to get her to this state. “Hmm, I’m
really always in the mood to pleasure Natsuki,” Shizuru said. Her
eyes flicked over to Natsuki with a quick glance before returning to
the floor. “Though I guess a few hints to let me know Natsuki’s
in the mood too wouldn’t be much of a problem. Natsuki should just
be warned that the more she works me up the less I’ll be able to
control myself with her.”</p><p><i>Good to know.</i>

Natsuki took a step closer to Shizuru and brought her other hand up
to Shizuru’s chin. She gently applied pressure to it to get Shizuru
to face her. “If you ever want to know what I’m in the mood for,
Shizuru, just look into my eyes.” Shizuru’s eyes met hers as she
said this. Natsuki let her mood pour out into her eyes. “For
instance, this expression means that I want you to take me, Shizuru.”</p><p>“Natsuki…”
Shizuru’s voice faded out. She seemed to be at a loss for words, so
she just smiled back at Natsuki. The blush on her cheeks remained
strong, and Natsuki had to struggle not to swoon at the sight of it.</p><p>Holding herself
together by keeping in mind that this would all pay off later,
Natsuki took another step closer to Shizuru. Her body was pressed
right up against the girl’s now, but she tried to ignore the
feeling of it for a few minutes longer. She removed her hand from
Shizuru’s chin and slowly reached down to grab the soap. Shizuru
made no effort to pull it away from her this time.</p><p>Natsuki kept her eyes
firmly locked with Shizuru’s as she brought the bar of soap to
touch Shizuru’s chest. Her girlfriend had already washed there, but
that wasn’t the point. A nervous and somewhat confused look
appeared in Shizuru’s eyes as Natsuki did this, so she spoke to
reassure her lover of her intentions, “And when you see this look
and I’m touching you like this…” She illustrated her point by
wiping the soap slowly across Shizuru’s chest and over the tops of
her breasts. “That means I want you to lose control of yourself.”</p><p>Shizuru didn’t say
anything further. She simply turned to face Natsuki and let her
growing blush and giddy smile speak for themselves. Her eyes seemed
to lose focus, and she let out periodic giggles and Natsuki spread
the soap over her body. Natsuki had to admit that her girlfriend was
simply adorable when she was in a state like this, and she resolved
to try to get her into it more often.</p><p>But right now, she
wanted to take full advantage of the opening Shizuru was giving her.
Natsuki could sense that she was actually keeping firm control over
herself right now – but it was only so that Natsuki would have the
freedom to arouse her even further before she jumped on her
girlfriend. Shizuru’s right hand was latched onto the railing on
the side of the shower while her left had reached up to grasp the
curtain rod. They weren’t holding on too tightly, but it was
apparent she was preparing to do so if she had to. Natsuki was
touched with how Shizuru was trying to make sure she had a chance to
play around with her first, and she resolved not to let the
opportunity go to waste.</p><p>Shizuru had already
soaped up her breasts, but Natsuki wasn’t going to let that stop
her from applying a second layer. The sight of the twin orbs covered
in soap was just priceless, but the feeling of them was even better.
Natsuki took full advantage of her chance to feel the slippery
globes, making sure she gave both of them a good working-over. The
soap needed to be well lathered up, after all, but more importantly,
Shizuru needed to be worked up. A mixture of giggles and moans
erupting from the girl let Natsuki know that she was doing a good job
at this task.</p><p>Keeping her right hand
up to further lather up Shizuru’s breasts, Natsuki brought the bar
of soap down with her left hand to work on the lower half of
Shizuru’s body, which hadn’t yet been soaped up. Shizuru giggled
a bit more as Natsuki did this, prompting the girl to look up at her
lover’s face. The blush on it had spread even further since Natsuki
had last checked it, covering almost all of her cheeks right now. It
was even rivaling some of those Shizuru was able to invoke in her.
Shizuru was definitely enjoying her treatment here, and Natsuki felt
confident that she’d soon be quite ready to repay the favor with
interest.</p><p>Natsuki crouched down
so she could work on washing the fronts of Shizuru’s legs,
regretfully removing her hand from the girl’s breasts. However,
there were plenty of other nice spots down below she could take
advantage of. After some brief consideration, she decided to let it
roam around a bit, caressing whatever part of Shizuru’s body it
happened to land upon while her other hand worked to soap it all up.</p><p>She took careful 
note
of the spots that seemed to provoke some extra reaction from Shizuru
– either from eliciting some sound or eliciting some reflexive
motion. The spot on Shizuru’s side where her HiME mark had been was
just as sensitive as usual, prompting a sharp gasp as Natsuki’s
fingers lightly traced over it, but it wasn’t the only sensitive
spot. Shizuru’s waistline also seemed to be a hot spot, judging by
the wave of shudders that ran through her body as Natsuki traced her
hand across it. Unsurprisingly, Shizuru’s inner thighs were also
quite sensitive.</p><p>Another fortunate
discovery of Natsuki’s was just how well Shizuru’s sides
responded to a very light touch as she dragged her fingers along
them. This seemed to extend through all of her height, so Natsuki
took advantage of this fact to play with the outer sides of her legs
a bit. She stroked her fingers downwards from Shizuru’s hip until
they met her feet, and then she dragged them upwards again. She kept
going past Shizuru’s hip this time, right until she was about to
meet Shizuru’s “pleasure button,” as she’d mentally termed
the former location of her HiME mark.</p><p>Shizuru’s breath
hitched as she prepared for Natsuki’s fingers to touch that spot,
but Natsuki diverted them at the last second. She quickly circled
around the sensitive area and brought her hand around Shizuru’s
back, gently gripping her butt. Shizuru slowly let out her breath as
she was spared that particular torment, and Natsuki thought she could
hear an “Ikezu” mixed into it, though it was hard to tell over
the sound of the water.</p><p>Eventually, Natsuki had
finished soaping up Shizuru’s lower body. She’d even gotten away
with moving the soap over some quite sensitive areas with no protest
from Shizuru. She was starting to worry a bit that Shizuru had
forgotten she was supposed to be losing control of herself by now.
Perhaps another reminder was in order.</p><p>Natsuki stood back up,
placing the soap down behind her. She took a look at Shizuru’s
face, which was now completely filled with a blush and still retained
the pleased giddiness she’d invoked in her lover earlier. Her eyes
had drifted closed, and she bore a contented smile. “Shizuru,”
Natsuki said gently, getting the girl to open up her eyes and gaze
back at her. Natsuki brought her hand up to gently trace her fingers
along Shizuru’s cheek. She mentally prepared herself for the
incoming assault and said, “Take me.”</p><p>Shizuru wasted no time
in acting, though it wasn’t in any way Natsuki had expected. The
most profound change was in her eyes. They filled with desire, and
they seemed to deepen as Natsuki stared into them. They were hungry –
Shizuru was hungry – and they seemed to be pulling her in. At that
moment, being consumed by Shizuru was exactly what Natsuki wanted, so
she gave herself up to the raw desire she saw in her lover.</p><p>As soon as Natsuki fell
under her power, Shizuru’s gaze softened into an expression of
love. Her arms slipped in under Natsuki’s and wrapped around her
back. Natsuki couldn’t pinpoint exactly what caused it, but her
muscles seemed to lose all strength at that moment. Only Shizuru’s
support kept her from collapsing to the ground. Maybe it had
something to do with the way Shizuru was looking at her. All she knew
was that Shizuru seemed to be having some hypnotic effect on her, and
she was helpless to resist, even if she wanted to.</p><p>Shizuru’s lips came
in kiss Natsuki’s, and she weakly responded. Despite all the work
she’d done in getting Shizuru aroused, the girl was still
surprisingly calm and gentle. If anything, her kiss was even more
loving than usual. Natsuki had been expecting her to go wild and
practically attack her when she was given the go-ahead. She’d been
wanting to make sure Shizuru finally stopped keeping herself in tight
control and let herself loose for her own good.</p><p>Perhaps she hadn’t
quite succeeded in that, but it was too late now. As soon as she’d
been given a chance, Shizuru had completely turned the tables on her.
She was being driven into an erotic haze of her own, and she was
completely under Shizuru’s power now. Using the last coherent
thought she could manage, Natsuki let out a mental sigh and resolved
to try again later. She then gave in completely to Shizuru’s
passion and let herself melt into her lover’s kiss.</p><p>Natsuki felt herself
being pushed back by Shizuru a bit, and she soon found herself pinned
against the wall. With her body now serving the purpose of supporting
Natsuki, Shizuru freed her arms and started using them to stroke
along her lover’s sides. A shiver ran through Natsuki’s body at
this touch, but the pressure of Shizuru against her kept her secure.
Eventually they came to rest just above Natsuki’s hips. A gentle
tickling above her left hip informed Natsuki that Shizuru’s hand
was merely a hair’s breadth away from touching her own pleasure
button.</p><p>Shizuru deepened the
kiss, slipping her tongue into Natsuki’s mouth. Natsuki eagerly
granted it access and let out a soft moan as she felt it stroking
across her own. The tongue circled around her mouth, eliciting
pleasure wherever it touched. Natsuki’s own tongue slowly started
to reciprocate, circling around Shizuru’s as it made its motions.
She reached her arms up around Shizuru on instinct, trying to pull
herself even further into her lover’s grasp.</p><p>Shizuru’s right hand
drifted down slightly, coming to cover the sensitive spot above
Natsuki’s hip. Even this gentle touch sent a jolt of energy through
Natsuki’s body. A gasp was forced out of her mouth which was so
powerful it nearly pushed Shizuru out of the kiss. She’d forgotten
just how tender that spot was. It had been so long since Shizuru had
touched her there, and this was the first time she’d done so when
Natsuki was already quite aroused and in a romantic mood. The feeling
was exhilarating, and she felt like she was being charged up with
sexual energy.</p><p>A gentle chuckle broke
from Shizuru’s lips at Natsuki’s reaction, and she slowly pulled
back from the kiss. Natsuki didn’t have an opportunity to do
anything in response, however, as Shizuru’s hand started gently
circling the spot on her hip. Shizuru gazed directly into Natsuki’s
eyes to watch her reactions. It was lucky that Shizuru had broken the
kiss, as the motions of her hand and the bolts of pleasure shooting
through Natsuki caused the girl to start letting loose a series of
uncontrolled moans and gasps.</p><p>Eventually, the motions
of Shizuru’s hand slowed to a pause, allowing Natsuki a chance to
catch her breath. A sparkle appeared in Shizuru’s eyes as Natsuki
was able to momentarily focus on them. All the joy she’d previously
brought to her girlfriend seemed to have coalesced there, and those
eyes bore a silent promise to Natsuki that it would all be repaid.
With a last quick kiss, Shizuru slipped downwards, slowly kissing her
way down Natsuki’s neck and chest until she came to rest on her
knees. Natsuki was careful to keep her hands interlocked around
Shizuru’s back even as the girl dipped lower.</p><p>Shizuru’s head came
to be nestled between Natsuki’s breasts. For a moment, she started
kissing her way around Natsuki’s left breast, though she soon
stopped with a slight moan. “Ara,” she said. “It would seem
I’ve gotten my Natsuki all soapy. Well, we’ll have to do
something about that so I can properly taste her.”</p><p>Natsuki’s mind
quickly flashed back to their encounter a few days ago when she had
made a personal catalogue of Shizuru’s tastes. <i>Does that mean
Shizuru plans to… to…</i> A blush flooded Natsuki’s face in
lieu of her mind being able to finish the thought. Even though she’d
already done just that to Shizuru, and Shizuru had already been
inside her with her hand, Natsuki’s modesty just couldn’t be
appeased that easily.</p><p>It could, however, be
distracted. The feeling of Shizuru’s hands scooping warm water from
the shower onto her breasts accomplished that in a matter of seconds.
She had nothing to fear from her modesty as long as Shizuru kept up
her actions. After a period of some delightful wiping, Natsuki’s
body was clean of the soap, and Shizuru went back to kissing her way
around her breasts.</p><p>Being Shizuru,
Natsuki’s lover of course couldn’t resist a little teasing. She
seemed to purposefully avoid Natsuki’s nipples as she circled her
way around her breasts. It took a moaned plea of “Shizuru…” in
Natsuki’s most pathetic voice before her tormentor finally relented
and took Natsuki’s nipple full into her mouth. The sensation was
almost shocking at first, and Natsuki’s legs nearly gave out from
under her. Only Shizuru’s quick grasp of her sides saved Natsuki
from crumbling to the floor.</p><p>Natsuki flailed her
arms out to the sides, finding a grip on the bath rail behind her.
She wished she could hold onto Shizuru, but sadly her lover was too
slippery for her to get a solid grip, and at this moment, keeping
herself upright was her first priority. The importance of this was
made clear as Shizuru started to lightly suckle on her nipple,
causing a wave of shudders to pass through Natsuki’s body.</p><p>Seeing that Natsuki was
stable enough, Shizuru’s left hand came up to gently massage her
right breast. Meanwhile, her tongue peaked out to flick at Natsuki’s
captured nipple. Natsuki felt a spark of energy leap through her body
at this, and she nearly lost her grip. She nearly lost it again when
Shizuru’s tongue started to make circles around the nub, sending
periodic waves of pleasure through her body.</p><p>After some time of this
predictable behavior, Shizuru started to vary up her tongue’s
routine. She intermixed flicking the tip of her tongue against
Natsuki’s nipple, stroking it around her areola, gently biting down
on the nub, and simply kissing it. At the same time, Shizuru’s left
hand was giving Natsuki’s other breast a similar treatment, mixing
in a few pinches with the massaging. The varied behavior kept Natsuki
permanently on edge, and she let out a series of moans that kept
rising in pitch. Apparently, this was exactly what Shizuru was
intending, as she proceeded onto the next phase of the game when
Natsuki was practically squeaking out her pleasure.</p><p>Natsuki wasn’t
fortunate enough to get any reprieve at all as Shizuru drifted
farther down her body, for although her mouth and left hand had left
Natsuki’s breasts, her right hand took up the task of tormenting
her by gently stroking her pleasure button once more. The rising
pleasure in Natsuki’s body almost made her afraid. Shizuru had
already pushed her so high, and yet her instincts were telling her
that there was still much further to go. The thought of her
inevitable fall from that height was daunting, to say the least. The
only thing that prevented it from frightening her was the reassurance
that Shizuru was there to guide her safely down. With Shizuru – her
lover and her love – taking her there, she knew it could only be
pleasurable.</p><p>Shizuru crossed her
legs as she reached the floor, placing her face at the perfect level
to access Natsuki’s core. But she didn’t start in with her face
quite yet. While her right hand finally stopped its torment of
Natsuki’s hip to hold her steady, Shizuru brought her left index
finger in to gently stroke Natsuki’s lower lips. She slowly stroked
around the sides at first, though a moan – one so high-pitched and
pathetic that it would have embarrassed Natsuki at any other time –
made her relent after only one circle and head towards the slit in
the center.</p><p>Shizuru started
stroking her finger along the slit, slowly prying it open. A stream
of pathetic moans and yelps were forced out of Natsuki’s mouth as
warm rays of pleasure shot through her body. She couldn’t help the
noises coming out, but she wasn’t even sure if she wanted to
anymore. She’d recognized all the effort Shizuru had gone through
to open herself up around her, dropping her usual mask as much as
possible. It wouldn’t be fair for Natsuki to keep hiding herself.
She’d been afraid it would be horribly embarrassing to reveal
herself, but Shizuru seemed to sense when this was a threat, and she
always laid off her teasing just enough.</p><p>A thought tried to form
in Natsuki’s mind – something about opening herself up to Shizuru
– but it just couldn’t make any headway against the current of
pleasure that was forcing itself into every corner of her
consciousness. All she could think of were ways to help Shizuru in
her quest. Trying not to let her feet slip out from under her,
Natsuki cautiously moved her feet out to spread her legs and open
herself up to her lover. When she thought she was stable enough, she
carefully removed her right hand from its grip on the rail and
brought it to the back of Shizuru’s head, silently pleading for her
girlfriend to finish the job.</p><p>Shizuru chuckled
pleasantly at Natsuki’s insistence, but fortunately she didn’t
resist. Her head drifted in as Natsuki pulled on it, and she moved
her hand away to get a grip on Natsuki’s hip. Trusting Shizuru to
hold her steady, Natsuki released her other hand from the rail and
brought it to the back of Shizuru’s head as well. She would have
preferred to be able to have even more contact with Shizuru – her
hugging instinct was starting to overwhelm her – but she would take
whatever she could get.</p><p>Shizuru’s tongue
finally swept out, meeting Natsuki’s outer lips and causing a rush
of heat through her body. She alternated sides a couple of times,
causing the heat to build to a nearly intolerable level. It
overwhelmed all of Natsuki’s being. She could think of nothing
other than a desperate need to feel the soft touch of Shizuru’s
tongue even deeper inside of her.</p><p>Ever attuned to her
lover’s needs, Shizuru seemed to find the perfect moment to fulfill
her desires. Just when Natsuki didn’t think she could take anymore
teasing just outside her core, Shizuru quickly moved in, her lips
finding their way immediately to aching bundle of nerves inside.
Natsuki practically screamed at the contact as bolts of lightning
stormed through her body, emanating from Shizuru’s most intimate
kiss.</p><p>Natsuki felt certain
that she would soon fall from the heights of pleasure that Shizuru
had rocketed her to, but Shizuru seemed prepared for this. Her tongue
slipped out between her lips to gently cover Natsuki’s clit,
embracing it and holding Natsuki up. The moment was bliss; Natsuki
felt as if all the pleasure that had built up were trapped in her
body. She wasn’t in any risk of it fading on her.</p><p>Sure
enough, Shizuru held her there for a time. Her tongue gently stroked
back and forth across Natsuki’s clit in order to keep her from
falling, slowly causing the nub to swell up in the process. The
sustained pleasure eventually started to overwhelm Natsuki. It wasn’t
that she didn’t like it, she just needed more. She needed
everything Shizuru could give to her, even if it meant she’d
eventually have to fall back to earth.</p><p>Natsuki tightened her
grip on Shizuru’s head, pulling her lover as close as possible.
Shizuru, never being one to miss a hint, eagerly obliged. Her mouth
drifted lower within Natsuki’s slit, until she was kissing her
girlfriend’s innermost set of lips. Pleasure pulsed through Natsuki
as Shizuru kissed them as she might her upper lips. Each pulse forced
out a whimpering moan from the girl, who was now all to eager to let
it out so Shizuru could hear the effect she was having on her
beloved.</p><p>A sharp squeak was
Shizuru’s reward as her tongue made its way inside Natsuki.
Seemingly satisfied with this response, her tongue started to explore
around. Everywhere it touched was alit with pleasure. Natsuki
couldn’t help but squirm in Shizuru’s grasp. She didn’t want
her lover to let go, and yet she just couldn’t keep still. The
feeling of that soft muscle in her most sensitive of places was too
much for her.</p><p>As more of Natsuki’s
being focused on the motions of Shizuru’s lips and tongue, her
muscles started to give out. Her legs weakened beneath her, and it
was only the grace of Shizuru’s hold that kept her up now. Natsuki
didn’t have the presence of mind left to worry about her precarious
position; she could only trust in Shizuru and focus on the waves of
pleasure her lover was bringing her.</p><p>Natsuki’s breathing
became labored as her whole body started to be engulfed in ecstasy.
The pace of it was soon matched by the rhythmic stroking of Shizuru’s
tongue inside of her. The result was that instead of the bursts of
pleasure within Natsuki mixing erratically, each stroke came at the
perfect time to build upon the previous wave. Natsuki could feel
herself coming closer and closer to release with every motion of her
girlfriend’s tongue.</p><p>Just as she was about
to hit, Shizuru paused the motions of her tongue for just a moment
before plunging it as deep into Natsuki as she could. The sharp
motion pushed Natsuki over the edge, and her body exploded in
ecstasy. She felt herself suspended in a moment of pure bliss.
Everything exploded out from within her, causing her innermost self
to pour out.</p><p>Natsuki reached her
hands out blindly for Shizuru, trying to find her anchor in the midst
of her fall from her peak. The rush of emotions from within her left
her feeling horribly vulnerable, with the realization of how she’d
finally taken the risk of falling in love and much pain she was
risking with it. She needed to know Shizuru was there for her. She
needed to feel her love’s comforting presence lest she break down
completely.</p><p>Fortunately, Shizuru
was indeed there for her. As soon as Natsuki started to flail for her
touch, Shizuru had slackened her grip to allow Natsuki to slide down
into her lap. She now cradled her girlfriend in her arms, while
Natsuki clutched desperately at her. Tears poured relentlessly from
Natsuki’s eyes as she pleaded almost incoherently for Shizuru to
stay with her, to never stop loving her. Somehow her words were
understood by her lover, and she soothingly stroked Natsuki’s back
and affirmed that it was alright, she’d never leave her.</p><p>Eventually, Shizuru’s
words and comfort helped to calm Natsuki down. She was aware of what
an embarrassing spectacle of herself she’d just made and of how
she’d unintentionally exposed all of herself to Shizuru, but she
was too worn out to care. Maybe she shouldn’t have cared in any
case; it was Shizuru she’d just exposed herself to, after all. It
was alright with Shizuru; she’d only end up loving her more for it.</p><p>“I’m never letting
you go, Shizuru,” Natsuki said as she gathered enough of her
strength to form a coherent sentence. She silently resolved that
she’d broach the subject of living with Shizuru soon – even if
just under the guise of sleeping over on a regular basis. She wanted
to do whatever she could to cement their relationship. She just
didn’t want Shizuru to think she wasn’t serious, saying it only
it the heat of passion, so she’d have to wait a bit.</p><p>“Ara…” Shizuru
purred happily. “I’d never want to. I’m Natsuki’s for life.”</p><p>Natsuki chuckled
slightly at Shizuru’s choice of words. At this moment, she felt
more like she was Shizuru’s, being protectively cradled by her
owner. Well, it didn’t matter. Either way, they were together.</p><p>After a few more
minutes of holding her, Shizuru pulled her head back from the embrace
and used her hand to gently bring Natsuki’s head to face hers. Her
expression was full of love and concern as she asked, “Are you
alright now, Natsuki? I’m sorry if that was a bit much for you…”</p><p>Natsuki mustered a 
weak
smile. “No, it’s alright Shizuru. I guess I was just expecting
something a bit different when you said you’d lose control of
yourself.” <i>Note to self: out-of-control Shizuru means
broken-down and exposed Natsuki afterwards. She also has a magic
tongue in addition to her magic hands.</i> “I’ll have to help you
lose control more often.”</p><p>Shizuru’s face lit up
from this simple statement, as if she was profoundly touched by it.
Natsuki had intended it only as a playful joke – and maybe a little
promise – but it seemed to mean something more to Shizuru. After a
moment of consideration, Natsuki guessed that maybe Shizuru was
taking it as an affirmation that she didn’t mind – maybe even
enjoyed – being broken down and exposed before her lover.</p><p><i>Well, I guess that’s
true. But only for you, Shizuru.</i> At this thought, Natsuki’s
mind suddenly became enraptured with the thought of finding some
other way to show this to her. The close proximity of their faces
gave her a good idea, so she leaned forward a bit to give Shizuru a
sweet, thankful kiss. When she pulled back, she was pleased to see a
blush had formed on her girlfriend’s cheeks. “I love you,
Shizuru,” she said.</p><p>Shizuru nodded a bit
weakly. “I love you too, Natsuki.” Her voice was starting to
waver a bit, as if she were still a bit overwhelmed by the emotions
Natsuki’s prior tacit admission. She cleared her throat though and
managed to focus herself. A twinkle appeared in her eyes, and she
said, “Now, I believe Natsuki still has some washing she needs to
do. Might she need a hand?”</p><p><i>A hand…</i> A
blush made its way to Natsuki’s cheeks at the thought of Shizuru’s
