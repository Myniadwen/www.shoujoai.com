    <p>“Seating arrangements, catering,   flowers… ahh… so many choices…What do you think Reito-san?” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Maybe roses… but lilies are   nice too…” Kanzaki Reito pondered, tapping his chin thoughtfully   as he skimmed through table cloth samples and pattern books, giving   each careful consideration. Warm breezes with just a hint of winter’s   chill flowed through one of the open windows of the student council   room, giving it a lazy springtime feel.  The top four members of   the council were enjoying a leisurely lunch while discussing some of   the details for the two main year-end events, the graduation celebration   and a formal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanami" target="_blank"><em><u>hanami</u></em></a> party. <br />
    </p>
    <p>Frustrated huffs and growls, punctuated   by the staccato-thrumming of impatient fingers on a desktop came from   the other end of the room where Suzushiro Haruka tried desperately to   keep firm control on her notorious temper. The apparent disinterest   of the Student Council President and Vice President seemed to be grating   on her nerves.  She fumed for a few minutes more slamming her fist   down on the table.   <br />
    </p>
    <p>“That’s it! It’ll take a   decade before the graduation can take place! You two just do what you   always do best and just leave the rest to me!” <br />
    </p>
    <p>All heads turned in her direction   at her sudden, but not unexpected, outburst. <br />
    </p>
    <p>“You’ll take care of the Graduation   ceremony preparations then, won’t you Suzushiro-san?” Fujino Shizuru’s   calm voice carried over the din filtering through the half-opened door   as students wandered from room to room at the change of class periods.   <br />
    </p>
    <p>The Executive Board Director’s   eyebrows beetled in annoyance as she realized that she was once again   being manipulated into doing what she perceived to be the lion’s share   of the work.  “Damn right I will,” she replied through clenched   teeth.  “No way I’m letting you and that tea-drinking playboy   embarrass Fuuka Gakuen by doing a half-assed job,” she gestured over   her shoulder at Reito, who was lounging idly in a chair nearby, savoring   a second cup of his favourite tea. <br />
    </p>
    <p>Shizuru continued to nurse her   own cup with an almost imperceptible narrowing of her eyes as the only   sign that Haruka’s slight had touched a nerve.  “As usual, I see   that I can count on you,” she acquiesced with a sidelong glance at   the now-smirking Vice President.  The look on his face spoke volumes. <em> You know how she gets when we have events like these.</em> The blonde   girl crossed her arms with an indignant sniff.   <br />
    </p>
    <p>“It’s a good thing you have   me around, otherwise you miscretins would never get anywhere.” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“You mean, <em>miscreants</em>,   Haruka-chan,” piped up a timid voice by the door.  Kikukawa Yukino,   the student council secretary, looked up briefly from her position at   a small desk beside the door, her laptop open in front of her and neat,   carefully typed notes from their impromptu meeting reflected in her   glasses from the glowing screen. <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Hmph! Whatever. Come along,   Yukino.  We’ve got work to do.” Haruka strode angrily out of   the room, leaving the poor secretary to hastily grab her laptop and   knapsack and follow in her wake. <br />
    </p>
    <p>A frustrated sigh escaped Shizuru’s   lips despite her best efforts.  “She’s always such a pleasure,”   Her dark-haired second-in-command chuckled at her exasperation.   <br />
    </p>
    <p>“It wouldn’t be the same without   Haruka-san making a big fuss over nothing.”  <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Indeed,” Shizuru murmured.   “Would you be so kind as to contact Suzushiro Corp for post-event   compensations?” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“The usual?” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“It <em>is</em> graduation.” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Hmm, I see your point.    I’ll triple the usual fee. And now that is settled,” he paused,   refilling his cup from the small <em>tetsubin </em> teapot that sat on the president’s desk. “You and I have other matters   to discuss.  Like how you’re going to keep Kuga-san from catching   fire when she realizes what you’re up to.” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Oh I do not think she will   mind when everything is all said and done,” the brunette replied with   a small smile.  “Besides, the <em>yozakura</em> party would be   the perfect place for her to learn the error of her ways.” <br />
    </p>
    <p>Reito laughed out loud at the   sheer audacity of Shizuru’s machinations.  “It is a dangerous   thing to neglect the needs of kaichou-sama.” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“I see you and I understand   each other perfectly, Reito-san,” she said with a straight face. <br />
    </p>
    <p>The young man laughed even harder.    “Well if I’m going to be up to my neck in this endeavour, you’d   best tell me what I’m to do.  I have a feeling I’m going to   need all of my wits in order to survive this little show.” <br />
    </p>
    <p>…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… <br />
    </p>
    <p>A lithe, leather-clad woman astride   a freshly detailed Ducati 749 Dark slowly rolled into her favourite   shaded spot behind a clump of Japanese maples.  The motorbike gave   one last throaty growl before fading into the sunny quiet as she cut   the ignition and removed her helmet to allow long, dark hair to flow   freely over her shoulders.  Her ever-vigilant green eyes quickly   gave the perimeter the once-over to make sure she was alone, hopped   off and started removing her <em>seifuku</em> and trademark hoodie from   a mid-sized backpack that was lashed to the rear of her seat. <br />
    </p>
    <p>Natsuki always tried to avoid   the hustle and bustle of the Fuuka Gakuen campus and today was no different.    It was much more active than normal these past couple of weeks as the   school year began to wind down and preparations for various ceremonies   and parties were in motion.  Starry-eyed couples dotted the perfectly   manicured landscape surrounding the massive Crystal Arboretum that was   Director Kazahana’s home.  The dark-haired girl rolled her eyes   at one lovestruck pair that dashed past her hiding place, giggling and   groping each other shamelessly. <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Will you people <em>please</em> get a room?” she muttered as a sudden flush crept into her cheeks.    Dressing hurriedly so as to avoid anymore wandering students, she stuffed   her riding suit into one of the hardshell saddle compartments and locked   her helmet to the well-hidden bike.  With a practiced flip of hair,   Natsuki turned and marched down the hidden path through the woods that   she normally took to escape the organized madness during the change   of classes. <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Late <em>again</em>, Kuga?    How typical of you.” <br />
    </p>
    <p>Natsuki whirled around and her   eyes targeted the speaker like a laser.  Yuuki Nao leaned casually   against a nearby tree, filing her nails as if she had nothing else better   to do. <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Nao! Isn’t there somewhere   else that you need to be?” she hissed through gritted teeth. <br />
    </p>
    <p>The red-haired delinquent pushed   off the trunk to stand cockily before her.  “Nothing is more   important than taking the opportunity to piss you off.” <br />
    </p>
    <p>Natsuki’s jaws worked as she   tried to will herself to remain in control of her emotions. She silently   wished that she still had the ability to conjure her ice pistols.    The urge to stick them both in the irritating underclassman’s face   and pull the triggers raged within.  After several seconds engaged   in a silent battle of wills, Nao’s insolent grin was countered by   an uncharacteristically sunny smile from Natsuki, taking the younger   girl completely by surprise.  Nao blinked then narrowed her eyes   in suspicion. <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Did I say something funny?” <br />
    </p>
    <p>The older girl merely shook her   head.  Nao was so much like her at that age, all attitude and fight,   a streetwise kid that needed guidance.  It was at times like these   that she realized how grateful she was that Shizuru had found her.    Despite her frivolous reputation, Shizuru was a patient teacher, loving   and wise.  The mask she put on for others was done out of necessity   and survival. In the time they spent getting reacquainted with each   other after the nearly cataclysmic HiME battle, Natsuki had come to   know the vulnerable, private Shizuru and not just the flirty, self-assured   Shizuru.  That realization brought the unbidden smile to her lips   that so irritated her opponent. <br />
    </p>
    <p>“It’s nothing.  I was   just remembering a lesson a very important person taught me once.    Anyway, you’ll have to forgive me if I can’t play with you today.    I’ve got things to do.”  She turned on her heel to go but Nao   couldn’t resist getting in one last parting shot. <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Jeez, Fujino really has you   whipped.  Who’d have thought the wolf could turn into a tame   lap dog?” <br />
    </p>
    <p>Natsuki stiffened mid-stride as   the taunt found the weak point in her carefully constructed armour.    She could put up with many things but her masculine side would not let   certain insults to her ego pass unchallenged.  “Better be careful,   Nao-san,” she commented in a deceptively mild tone.  “This   wolf still has her fangs.”</p>
    <p>“Oh ho ho, that’s rich!    What will you do?  Run to your sugar momma and tell on me?” Nao   snarked. <br />
    </p>
    <p>Natsuki whirled around, her fists   clenched reflexively.  “What did you just say?” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“You heard me, Kuga.” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“I’m sorry, I must have missed   that.  How about you come a little closer and fill me in?” A   wolfish grin spread across the biker girl’s face and her eyes glittered   dangerously.  Anyone with common sense would have fled while they   still had the chance.  Alas, Nao wasn’t known to have that trait. <br />
    </p>
    <p>“What?  Do you think I’m   scared of you?  Please!” <br />
    </p>
    <p>The “conversation” quickly   disintegrated into a playground-type shoving match with both girls wrestling   each other for domination.  Natsuki was pulling on Nao’s cheeks   and Nao had a firm grip on the front of her shirt when both girls heard   laughter coming from a nearby walking path.  Each instinctively   dropped into a crouch to hide in the bushes to avoid being noticed by   the passersby. <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Reito-san, you really are devious.” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Well that <em>is</em> the reason   why you helped me get elected, was it not?” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Perhaps.” <br />
    </p>
    <p>Natsuki’s eyes nearly bugged   out of her head.  She recognized that voice!   <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Wha-? Wha-?” she sputtered.  <br />
      <br />
      ”Shh!” Nao admonished her.  “Do you <em>want</em> to spend   the rest of the school year in detention with Sr. Yukariko and that   crackpot cleric?” <br />
    </p>
    <p>The two voices continued to tease   each other with light, flirtatious banter until they close enough to   be seen.  Shizuru and Reito came strolling into view, with her   arm linked very affectionately in his. Nao practically had to sit on   Natsuki to keep her from giving away their hiding spot.  The pair   continued to chat amiably as they sauntered down the well-trodden path   towards the campus administration building.  After a few minutes   of tense waiting (and much gnashing of teeth on Natsuki’s part), the   girls finally crawled out of the bushes. <br />
    </p>
    <p>“That was—“ the elder student   struggled in vain against her traitorous mouth as she couldn’t seem   to form a coherent thought.  Indignant rage was clearly written   all over her face. “Did you know--?!” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Of course, I knew who it was,”   came Nao’s long suffering reply as she picked stray leaves out of   her hair. “Who’d have thought that Kanzaki was actually interested   in girls?” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“You’re not helping,” Natsuki   singsonged. <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Well then, I guess you have   a mystery on your hands.  Oh my, look at the time,” Nao glanced   at her non-existent watch.  “Gotta run!” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Oi!  Where do you think   you’re going?” Natsuki grabbed the collar of her seifuku and jerked   her up short before she had the chance to take flight. <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Oh no no,” the red-head shook   her head. “This has nothing to do with me.  Getting involved   with you and that evil girlfriend of yours is bad news.” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Who says that I’m giving   you a choice?” Nao cocked a curious eyebrow. Apparently the wolf still   had her claws as well.   <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Hmm…I admit, I <em>am</em> curious about this little situation.”  She paused as she tapped   thoughtfully on her chin with a manicured, blood-red fingernail.    “Buuut not enough to help you.  Sorry!”  Nao tossed her   rival a dismissive wave and disappeared into the thicket. <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Nao! You bastard!” Natsuki   yelled after her.  “Fine.  FINE!  I can get to the   bottom of this on my own.”  She hitched her briefcase over one   shoulder and wandered off in the opposite direction, muttering indignantly   to herself. <br />
    </p>
    <p>“Do you really think she fell   for it?” Reito asked in hushed tones as he watched a brassed-off Natsuki   march past the deeply shaded spot where he and Shizuru stood. <br />
    </p>
    <p>Shizuru answered his question   with a chuckle.  “I guess we’ll soon see.  You did a marvelous   job by the way.” <br />
    </p>
    <p>“It was for a good cause.    Hopefully, only the &quot;somewhat outrageous&quot; rumours will float   about.  I love you like a dear sister but Hiro-kun won’t be very   happy if he thinks that my attentions are wandering,” he warned, taking   care to mention the detrimental effects Shizuru’s plan could have   on his love life. <br />
    </p>
    <p>“You needn’t worry, Reito-san,”   she assured him with a sly wink as they walked out of the glade together.    “After all, it was <em>his</em> idea.” <br />
