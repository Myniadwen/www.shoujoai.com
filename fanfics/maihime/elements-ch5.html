&quot;Damn it, damn it, damn it DAMN IT!&quot; A voice cursed into the air as 
papers and books were shuffled to one side to the other and back again.

&quot;Calm down Natsuki, it&#39;s okay,&quot; A soothing Kyoto voice soon followed the 
string of curses.

&quot;Calm down? Calm down! How can I calm down!?&quot; Natsuki shouted again, 
with more anger directed towards the other figure in the room.

&quot;Please, you might make the neighbors mad over such a ridiculous 
reason,&quot; the Kyoto-ben tried to persuade the dark haired girl into 
quieting down.

With a second of silence, a rather loud angry exhale of air was heard 
and then Natsuki spoke, &quot;Okay, you have a point but I&#39;m still pissed 
about this.&quot;

The Kyoto-ben turned to her and smiled, calming her even more, &quot;Natsuki, 
it&#39;s only your math homework, you can redo it,&quot; she said, finally 
stating the problem.

&quot;I know it&#39;s only Math homework Shizuru, but I worked hard on it,&quot; 
Natsuki whined as she sat down next to Shizuru on the couch.

Shizuru, taking the chance, wrapped her arm around Natsuki&#39;s shoulder 
and pulled her in slightly. Natsuki a little wary of this took a moments 
time to relax and rest her head on the other girl&#39;s shoulder. In turn, 
Shizuru rested her head upon Natsuki&#39;s taking in a fresh breath of her 
beloved, &quot;Ara, if Natsuki finds Math that hard then I would gladly love 
to help my trouble puppy,&quot; Shizuru stated in a mocking tone.

Natsuki cringed at the nickname Shizuru had given her. Puppy? I&#39;m not a 
puppy... If anything I&#39;m like a wolf. A strong one at that! No! Wait! 
Off subject, homework, right. Natsuki shifted out of the hold and turned 
to Shizuru, &quot;Oi, I don&#39;t need your help with Math,&quot; Natsuki said 
crossing her arms over her chest.

&quot;Oh, really. I&#39;ll take your word for it, but you must tell me why you&#39;re 
freaking out when the homework isn&#39;t due until the end of this weekend. 
And, in case you forgot, it&#39;s only Saturday,&quot; Shizuru stated in a 
matter-of-fact manner as she leaned in closer to the dark haired girl.

Natsuki leaned back, trying her best to keep this a serious situation, 
but knew it wasn&#39;t going to work with the queen of silliness sitting in 
front of her. &quot;I-It&#39;s just the thought of losing it, not really the work 
put into it... Well, it&#39;s that as well, but it&#39;s just annoying,&quot; Natsuki 
said as she turned her head to the side in hopes of hiding her blush 
from the closeness of Shizuru.

As hard as she tried, Natsuki knew that Shizuru knew about her blush 
because as soon as Natsuki felt the blush form on her cheeks, a sly 
smile was formed by soft pink lips, which were oh-so close to hers.

Shizuru was debating on whether she should pull in and take the kiss 
from Natsuki, or just pull out and leave the poor girl hanging. After a 
moments thought, she went with the latter. And with that she pulled away 
from her and saw a look form on the other girl&#39;s face. The look was 
exactly what she had expected from her&#151;a confused and disappointed look.

Shizuru looked at her watch to pretend as though she hadn&#39;t seen the 
look, but when she did look at her watch she noticed Natsuki had stayed 
here a little too long. Not that she would normally care, but her 
parents were supposed to come home tonight. She didn&#39;t want Natsuki to 
leave, she felt as though they were really hitting it off tonight; 
however, she knew that her parents would enjoy the peace and quiet after 
such an intense business trip.

As if on cue, Shizuru felt a vibrating in her left pocket and then a 
melody that she had set for her father&#39;s cell phone.

It took her a moment to get to the phone with the tight jeans trying to 
keep her fingers from entering the pocket. While Shizuru was moving 
towards her phone, Natsuki watched and fell silent, suddenly aware of 
how late it was.

Shizuru smiled at Natsuki weakly and finally get the phone out after the 
third ring, she answered the phone with a polite, &quot;Hello father.&quot;

A mumble was heard on the other end, but Natsuki couldn&#39;t really make 
out what was being said, so she just waited patiently and flopped down 
onto the rest of the couch, with her legs still half crossed.

------

After awhile, Natsuki began to nod off when she finally heard the 
conversation being wrapped up. The dark haired girl rolled to one of her 
sides when she hear Shizuru whisper good-bye and a quick I miss you 
before a nice click and the phone was placed on the table.

Natsuki didn&#39;t want to leave, but she knew what Shizuru was going to 
say-- that she needed to go, even though Natsuki knew that Shizuru 
didn&#39;t want her to leave either.

Without warning, she heard movement and felt a body fall in between her 
and the couch&#39;s backrest. A little shocked and surprised by this, 
Natsuki just blinked before muttering, &quot;huh?&quot;

Shizuru&#39;s hand slipped around the girl&#39;s form, lightly pressing against 
Natsuki&#39;s toned abdomen and felt the tightening of the muscles as her 
finger glided past, onto the other side of her side. The grip tightened, 
as Natsuki was pulled closer to Shizuru&#39;s body. Natsuki gasped aloud 
softly at the sudden change.

A breath was felt along Natsuki&#39;s neck, &quot;My parents wont be here for 
another day,&quot; Shizuru breathed.

&quot;Why,&quot; Natsuki could barely get the words out.

&quot;Rain,&quot; Shizuru said as she lightly bit the back of Natsuki&#39;s neck as a 
pleasurable moan escaped Natsuki&#39;s throat.</pre>
