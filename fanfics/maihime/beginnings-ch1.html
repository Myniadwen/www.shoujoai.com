When did it start?

Was it when we first met?  When she swooped in like some magnificent
prince out of a fairytale, forcing those bullies off of me by sheer 
force of will?  

I remember it like it was yesterday...

&quot;Hey squirt, me and my friends want to ask you some questions.  Why do 
you always stay by yourself over here, huh?  Is it &#39;cuz you don&#39;t have 
any friends?  Yea, that&#39;s it, nobody wants to be friends with a weirdo 
like you.&quot;  

I remember his mocking laugh, and his little cronies echoing it behind 
him... I didn&#39;t want to be talking to him, I just wanted to play alone 
in the sandbox like I always did.  I wanted to be by myself, to play 
pretend and not be alone.  When I was alone, I could be with anybody I 
wanted, I could go on adventures with the people from my stories, I 
could be anybody I wanted to be.  I didn&#39;t just have to be little 
&quot;weirdo&quot; me, but then these guys had to come and take that away from me.
I remember the tears welling up in my eyes, and running down my young 
cheeks.

&quot;No, I just... I mean, I have lots of fun over here by myself, an--&quot;

&quot;Yea, I bet you do, all alone without any friends.  You think being by 
yourself is fun?  You are stupid, aren&#39;t you?  Stupid, boring, 
friendless, what&#39;s your name anyway?  Wait, don&#39;t tell me, it doesn&#39;t
matter, a little weirdo like you doesn&#39;t need a name. Little weirdo 
playing by herself every day.&quot;  

And again with his derisive laughter, echoed seconds after by the 
others.

&quot;No!  My name is Yuki--&quot;  I tried to tell them, thought that maybe if
they knew my name, they would stop.

&quot;Little dumb boring weirdo. Nobody wants to be friends with the weirdo!&quot;

They wouldn&#39;t listen, and I felt more tears come.  Why couldn&#39;t they 
just leave me alone?  What did I ever do to them, I just wanted to play
like I always did.  They kept on teasing me, and teasing me, and I 
didn&#39;t do anything but sit there, and cry.  Being the bullies they were,
this only encouraged them to keep going, of course.
  
But then, just when I was about to give up and go run inside, when I was
going to find a little corner to be by myself in, to try and read one of
my books and to forget about who I was and be a hero instead, even if
only for a little bit, a miracle happened.  

&quot;HEY!  What are you guys doing to her!?&quot;  

This girl ran up to us, and I couldn&#39;t help but marvel at her.  It 
didn&#39;t matter about her size, or age, or scuffed knees, or anything:
She looked as brave as the most courageous prince I&#39;d ever read about,
and as pretty as the most beautiful princess.  She walked right up to
me, this wonderful look of care in her striking violet eyes, before
turning to my tormentors, her golden locks swinging behind her.

&quot;What&#39;s going on here?  Huh, you better tell me!&quot;  

She wasn&#39;t afraid of those boys at all, not like me.  She was big, and
strong, and brave, and wonderful.

&quot;Why should we? It&#39;s none of your business!  Why don&#39;t you just go away
little girl, go play with some dolls or something.&quot;  

It was the leader boy again, and for a split second I was afraid my
champion was going to do just that, was going to go away.  But then she
did something I&#39;ll never forget.  She marched right up to that boy, and
stood nose to nose with him... well, nose to chin, he was a little
taller.  She looked up, and stared him strait in the eye.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you go away! I don&#39;t like bullies like you stupid boys!  Why
don&#39;t you go eat some mud or some other dumb thing that boys do.&quot;  

She sneered at him, and he actually looked a little scared, I don&#39;t
think anybody had ever talked to him like that.  But, with his friends
behind him, he wasn&#39;t going to back down to a girl.

&quot;You can&#39;t talk to me like that!&quot;  He finally yelled.  

My savior just snorted, and then she actually laughed.  Even though he
was a few inches taller than her, she suddenly seemed so much bigger
than him.

&quot;Yea?  What are you gonna do about it?&quot;  And she pushed him over.  

I could have jumped up and cheered, if I wasn&#39;t still entranced by her.
The boy was shocked, and landed on his behind in the grass, his friends
trying to pick him up.

&quot;Well?  Do you still wanna stay here, or are you gonna leave before I
get mad!?&quot;  

The girl walked back over towards me, and turned to face the boys once
more, like she was my protector.  The boys all looked angry, but they
looked scared too, they didn&#39;t want a fight with this girl, they just
wanted to pick on poor little me.  She looked each of them in the eye,
and then pointed her hand to the side.

&quot;Well then go!  Get out of here!  Get lost you creeps, you morons, you
bullies!&quot;  

And after a few moments hesitation, that&#39;s what they did.  I remember it
so clearly, seeing my tormentors turn and run like little puppies with
their tails between their legs, all because of this magnificent hero 
that came to my rescue.  Then she turned towards me, still looking angry
with those boys, bright eyes flashing like lightning.  But then as she
looked at me, kneeling on the ground with the remnants of tears still on
my eyes and face, those eyes softened in a way that I will always
remember, and always treasure whenever I get to see it.

&quot;Hey, are you okay?&quot;  

I could only kneel there, basking in her attentions.  I knew I was
staring at her, and that I should be answering her question, but I could
only look upon my savior with adoration.  We stared at each other for a
few moments, and she started to look a little uncomfortable, so she
finally said.

&quot;Um.. okay then.  I&#39;ll see you later, I hope you won&#39;t let those guys
bother you again.&quot;  And she started to walk away.  I panicked, for a
reason I didn&#39;t know back then, and scrambled to my feet, running after
her.

&quot;Wait!  Thank you very much for saving me from those bullies.  You were
great!&quot;  I smiled up at her, wanting to make sure she knew just how much
I liked her and what she had done for me.

&quot;Eh, thanks, um... what&#39;s your name?&quot;  

We were both standing facing each other now, her looking just a little
bit down to meet my eyes, because she was taller than me.
  
&quot;My name is Yukino, Kikukawa Yukino.&quot;  

I folded my hands before me, and bowed slightly.

&quot;Okay then.  Thanks Yukino, I was happy to help.  I don&#39;t like bullies.
My name is Haruka, too, Suzushiro Haruka.&quot;  She offered a hand, and I 
took it shyly.

&quot;Well, glad to meet you Yukino, maybe we&#39;ll see each other again some
time?&quot;  And she started to go once more.  Without really meaning to, I
found myself trailing her.  I didn&#39;t even feel like I needed to say
anything, it felt so natural to just follow along behind her, my quick
little steps echoing in the wake of her determined stride.  She kind of
felt me behind her, and turned her head.

&quot;Er, Yukino, are you following me?&quot;  

She asked, but she didn&#39;t really seem at all off-put about it, just
asking a question.  I couldn&#39;t think of anything else to say, so went
with the simple truth.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Um, I heard a little bit of what those boys were saying.  Do you really
not have any friends to play with?&quot;

I shook my head.

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t really either.  Do you want to be friends?&quot;  She said it 
so simply, so effortlessly, she couldn&#39;t have known that she just made
my little five-year-old dreams come true.  I smiled really big, and
nodded my head.

&quot;Yes, Haruka-chan, I want to be friends.&quot;

&quot;Okay, we&#39;re friends then.  Let&#39;s go play.&quot;  

&quot;Okay, Haruka-chan.&quot;

She started walking again, and I found myself naturally finding a place
just behind and to the side of her.  We walked through that park, that
day and so many others past that.  We played like ordinary children, and
she was always there for me.  I never had to worry about being picked
on, or teased, or bullied again, because from that day on, she was
always with me.

So, was that when it started?  Was that when I first started falling in
love with my Haruka-chan?  Was it so simple as that, so simple as she
being the noble hero that swept me, the poor damsel, off my feet and
carried me away to her castle where she wouldn&#39;t let anybody hurt me
again?

Whatever it was, there&#39;s no doubt about it.  I love my Haruka-chan, and
I won&#39;t let her down.
  
I hear her call my name, and I snap out of my reverie, it&#39;s time to go
do our duty, and I have my part to play too.  I run forward to catch up,
and smile at her.  I laugh inwardly as I see her exasperated expression.
I wonder if she&#39;s really so concerned about her job, or if she was
worried that she might have lost me.  

Don&#39;t worry Haruka-chan, you&#39;ve always been there for me, and that&#39;s how
I always want it to be.  We walk now, eleven years from then, across the
grass, and I can&#39;t help but think of that little girl from so many years
before.  I look fondly at the woman she grew to be.  Still so full of
that childhood faith in truth, and honesty, and justice... I vow that
I&#39;ll continue to do my best to make as much of that world a reality for
her, for all she&#39;s done for me.</pre>
