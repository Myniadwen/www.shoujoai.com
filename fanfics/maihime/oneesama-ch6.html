<h1>Oneesama (part 6 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leebot.html">Leebot</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/oneesama-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><p>Mai's Friendship</p><hr><p>Natsuki allowed herself to linger a few minutes before she 
left 
for work. It was quite the task to tear herself away from the sight of the blissfully 
sleeping Shizuru. It was often a bit hard to do this in the morning, but her heart was 
working overtime today in anticipation of her plans for this evening.</p><p>Letting out a 
sigh, Natsuki realized that she really did have to get going at this point. She placed her 
note and the wedding invitation down on the bed near Shizuru and leaned down to give her 
love a last kiss on the cheek. This prompted a delicate purr from Shizuru as her smile 
widened ever so slightly, nearly causing Natsuki's heart to shatter from adoration. She had 
to fight to tear herself away again.</p><p>It wasn't until Natsuki had exited the bedroom 
and closed the door behind her that she could rest and let out a sigh of relief as Shizuru's 
magnetic pull on her heart started to fade. After she was stabilized, she pulled her phone 
out of her pocket and typed out a quick message: “BEGIN OP. GREEN MAYO.” She scrolled 
through her contacts list and picked out her fellow conspirators, sending them the message 
and praying that they all got it in time to get their parts done.</p><p>Lastly, Natsuki 
punched the speed-dial for Mai as she started heading off to work. She had to at least be 
aware of the excuse Natsuki used for keeping Shizuru occupied, even if she couldn't get 
Shwartz to play along and had to improvise.</p><p>“Mai,” Natsuki's friend said as she 
answered the phone.</p><p>“It's Natsuki. Today's the day.”</p><hr><p>The enrollment battles 
were the first major event of the Garderobe school-year. It was the first time most of us 
Corals got to see a real battle between Otome in person. Various Pearls had been paired up 
for fights, along with a few other interesting events, such as a two-on-two match and a 
four-Pearl free-for-all. The final fight of the night was even going to feature two Meister 
Otome, one of them being the Gakuencho herself. The other was supposed to be the Third 
Column, but Adriana-sama had been injured just a week ago and was still in recovery, so it 
remained to be seen who would be taking her place.</p><p>Aside from the final battle, the 
most anticipated was the introductory battle, between the top two Pearls. Although this was 
generally a big deal in most years, their added bet this year just made everyone even more 
anxious to see the outcome. I had to fend off approximately one third of the whole school 
who wanted to know what I thought of the whole thing. Eventually I decided that I just 
wanted it all to be over so I didn't have to deal with those questions anymore.</p><p>“Ah, 
it's just like a novel,” Mai said from next to me. She'd been the most relentless about 
asking me how I felt about this, and the only one I could never shut up. Glancing over at 
her, I noticed that she appeared to be starry-eyed as she was lost in fantasy-land, 
prompting an eye-roll from me. “'A life-or-death battle where the fate of the school's 
next-generation celebrity, Natsuki Kruger, is waged. Drawn into that vortex, our heroine 
still remains silent,' huh?”</p><p>I tried to get Mai to shut up by will alone, glaring at 
her, but I really don't know why I bothered. My glare never really did work on 
her.</p><p>Mai just ignored my glare and nudged me, trying to provoke some more positive 
reaction. “It's incredible! You're like a heroine in a drama, Natsuki...”</p><p>“Stop it!” I 
spat at her. <i>Why did all of this have to happen to me?</i> I wondered. I didn't come to 
Garderobe hoping to be at the center of all this drama. I just wanted to become an Otome and 
go back to serve my family and make my parents – well, my mother at least – proud. I wished 
I'd never developed a crush on Shizuru and idolized her like that; it would have made things 
so much simpler, and my heart wouldn't ache so much.</p><p>“Say, Natsuki...” Mai said, 
ignoring my requests for her to stop, as she always did. “What do you wish for? Do you want 
Shizuru-san to win? Or rather... Haruka-san?”</p><p>I let out a grunt. I'd been avoiding 
this question ever since the wager was first made, but Mai just wouldn't let up. The 
frustration of the whole thing was finally starting to get to me. “Who cares...” I said, 
though I really should have listened to the pain building up in my heart at that 
moment.</p><p>“Natsuki...” The pleading tone of Mai's voice tugged at my heart. I knew I was 
lying to myself, and she probably knew it as well.</p><p>“Because Shizuru-Oneesama is that 
kind of person...” I said, in a last-ditch attempt to justify not caring, more to myself 
than Mai at this point. I had to keep my heart from hoping for Shizuru to win, because it 
wouldn't be able to stand being broken again. “It doesn't matter anymore...”</p><p>“But... 
you've come this far!” Mai said. “It's you who should be with Shizuru-san! You were just 
being egotistic in dreaming of an ideal Shizuru, so it's your own fault that you got 
disillusioned with the real one. And that Shizuru thinks all her fans to be the same, is 
that the reason for you being like this? She already told you she'd realized she was wrong 
in that...”</p><p>“Mai...” I pleaded. I did not want to go back into a depression in a 
public place like this, so I really didn't need her pushing me, not now. I glanced around 
the stands near us, but fortunately no one seemed to be listening in. It was just a matter 
of time, though, before someone around us tried to butt in.</p><p>Mai let out a sigh and 
shook her head. “Fine then. Perhaps I should try my best to become Shizuru's heya-gakkari, 
if you won't. That lovely smile of hers did intrigue me a bit...”</p><p>“What? No way!” I 
said. The thought of Mai taking Shizuru away from me was just too much for my heart to take. 
It had decided at that moment that I needed to take my chance with Shizuru. I still didn't 
know much about who she really was, but that was how all relationships started out. My heart 
was telling me this was right, if the two of us could break through all the facades we'd put 
up.</p><p>“Is that so?” Mai said. She had to struggle to hold back a gleeful smile from 
crossing her face, but she still failed. “Then go, Natsuki. You can still catch her before 
the match starts.”</p><p>“Huh? But...” What was I going to say? What was I getting into? I 
know she'd apologized, but did she really want me? Well, she had agreed to the 
challenge...</p><p>“Don't think, Natsuki! Just run!” Mai shoved me out of my seat with this. 
I struggled for something more to say to her, but in the end I decided on a simple nod. She 
was right, the words would come to me. Shizuru just needed to know that I wanted her to 
win.</p><p>I rushed my way through the stadium, trying to work back through my memory to my 
first few days here when I'd gone on a tour of it so I could find my way to the waiting 
rooms. I lucked out with seeing a couple of Pearls wandering around when I got close. Not 
caring anymore about what people thought, I grabbed the hand of one of the Pearls and spun 
her around, saying, “Shizuru... where is she?”</p><p>The Pearl's eyes flashed in confusion 
for a couple seconds, but then she seemed to recognize me. “She's at the east gate, about to 
enter the field,” she told me. “You'll have to hurry.”</p><p>“East gate?”</p><p>The Pearl 
pointed me to a door across the room. “That door, go left and run; it's the first right. And 
good luck.”</p><p>I nodded and mumbled thanks to her before continuing to run. The path past 
the door curved around until I reached an opening. A flash of chestnut caused my heart to 
scream out in my chest and I stumbled to a stop.</p><p>“Shizuru-Oneesama!” I said. I could 
feel my heart pounding rapidly in my chest, and I was almost bursting at the seams with 
excitement. All my instincts were telling me that this was right.</p><p>Shizuru turned to me 
slowly. Her face seemed to convey a touch of surprise, though she was trying to cover it up 
as best as she could. “Natsuki-san?” she said, her voice tinged with 
nervousness.</p><p>Remembering Mai's earlier advice, I shut off my mind and just let the 
words spill out. “I... please make me your heya-gakkari!”</p><p>“Ara...” Shizuru's eyes 
blinked rapidly as she processed this. Not willing to take the chance that she'd find 
something to worry about, I rushed to continue.</p><p>“I... I want to know so much more 
about you! Not about the fake you that I willfully constructed, but about the real 
you!”</p><p>Shizuru was silent for a long minute as she stared back at me in wonderment. I 
was nervous as hell while I waited, but I was blessed with a truly rare sight which helped 
to take my mind off of that. Slowly, a pink tinge filled Shizuru's cheeks. It was the first 
time I'd ever seen her blush, and I absolutely adored the sight. Making it even more special 
was the knowledge that I was likely one of a precious few who had seen 
it.</p><p>“Natsuki...” Shizuru said eventually. Her voice seemed almost choked up, but she 
pushed through. “If you can forgive me for my earlier indiscretion, then yes, I'll be your 
Oneesama.”</p><p>The excitement caused a blush to form in my own cheeks, and I nodded 
happily. I heard what sounded like a whimper from Shizuru which caused me to look up at her 
in concern. “Shizuru-oneesama...? Is something wrong?”</p><p>“Wrong? Ara, no...” She said. 
She tightened her lips into and said in explanation, “Natsuki's just so cute when she 
blushes...”</p><p>Naturally, this caused yet another blush to cross my cheeks, which I 
regretted almost immediately. She must think I was trying to be cute for her! Er, wait, 
don't I kind of want her to think I'm cute? But no! Not if it means she'll be trying to make 
me blush all the time!</p><p>A melodic giggle broke me out of my internal debate. I looked 
up to see Shizuru trying halfheartedly to cover up her laughter. Eventually she got it under 
control, though, and she said, “Forgive me, but Natsuki was just being too adorable. I'm 
sorry, I really should try harder, since Natsuki was sweet enough to give me a second 
chance...”</p><p>I shook my head fiercely at this. “No!” At Shizuru's shocked expression, I 
quickly explained, “I mean, I wanted to know who you really are, so if this is it, then 
well... I'll have to learn to live with it. Just don't get grabby again. That isn't really 
you anyways, I'm sure.”</p><p>For the second time in my life, I was treated to what would 
eventually become my favorite sight in the world: Shizuru's blush. “Natsuki...” she 
said.</p><p>Before Shizuru could say anymore, a voice called out from the stadium, “Shizuru! 
You're up now, come on!”</p><p>Shizuru turned towards the source of that voice. “Thank you,” 
she called out. “I'll be right there.” She turned back to me and said, “Ara, it's time for 
me to go win the privilege of having Natsuki-san as my heya-gakkari. I'll see you 
soon.”</p><p>I nodded at Shizuru as she started to turn away. “Good luck, Oneesama!” Shizuru 
gave me a small nod and a sweet smile that nearly caused me to faint as she walked 
off.</p><p>Fortunately, I quickly recovered once Shizuru was out of sight, so I was able to 
rush back to my seat before I missed too much. The girls in the stands seemed to be getting 
more excited, so I suspected that an announcement had been made while I was out of earshot. 
I reached my seat just in time to here the Gakuencho announce, “Then, let's begin the 
enrollment battles!”</p><p>Mai looked over at me as I sat down. She must have been able to 
read my face, as a knowing smile broke out on hers. “It's starting,” she said 
simply.</p><p>“Yeah...” I replied. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I tried to 
reassure myself that there was no way Shizuru would lose. She'd gained the rank of first 
Pearl after all, so that had to mean she was stronger than Haruka-san. Even though I could 
assure myself that she'd win, I was still anxious for it to actually happen. For me, her 
victory would mark the point where our relationship could truly start.</p><p>“Trias number 
one, Shizuru Viola!” And there she was, standing on a pillar which rose out the ground into 
the stadium. She was the perfect image of an Otome: beautiful, graceful, and with a sense of 
her strength lying just below the surface. The stadium erupted into cheers for her, along 
with a more-than-healthy dose of squealing. I couldn't help but join in with cheering for 
her, though I limited myself to clapping and shouting encouragement.</p><p>“Trias number 
two, Haruka Armitage!” Another chorus of cheers and squeals erupted as Haruka-san rose into 
the stadium. While Shizuru had simple stood there gracefully and given a slight bow, Haruka 
waved frantically to her fans and tried to egg them on until her cheers were even louder 
than Shizuru's.</p><p>When the cheering had quieted in anticipation of the signal to begin, 
Haruka took this chance to call out to Shizuru, loud enough for most of the stadium to hear 
thanks to its acoustics, “You finally got in the mood to do this, huh... Then come on! Give 
all you've got! I'll be giving my breast as well!”</p><p>There was an instant of stunned 
silence in the stadium before a girl sitting to Mai's right yelled out, “It's 'I'll be 
giving my <i>best</i>,' Haruka-chan!”</p><p>“I know that!” Haruka yelled back irately, and I 
thought I could see a touch of a blush on her cheeks, though it was hard to tell from that 
distance.</p><p>Mai, being the incessantly – and often annoyingly – social type, of course 
decided to take this chance to chat up the girl next to her. “Excuse me... are you a friend 
of Haruka-oneesama?”</p><p>“Ah, yes,” the girl said, turning to shake Mai's hand. “My name 
is Yukino Chrysant. I'm a fourth year at Windbloom University.”</p><p>“Mai Tokiha,” Mai 
responded. “A fourth year, you say? You don't look much older than us...”</p><p>“Well, being 
able to study abroad, I tried do it as fast as possible...” Yukino explained. She caught my 
eye at this point and reached out to shake my hand. “Moreover, could you, by any means, be 
Natsuki-san?”</p><p>“Uhm... why?” I asked as I took her hand.</p><p>“I knew it! I had a 
discussion with Haruka-chan... She said that a friend of hers was troubled because of an 
underclassman, and neither of them was willing to listen to anyone. She tried a lot of 
things, but nothing worked... That's why I...”</p><p>“Wait,” Mai said. “Are you saying that 
you're the one who gave Haruka-oneesama the idea to ask Natsuki to be her 
heya-gakkari?”</p><p>“Er... did that cause trouble?”</p><p>“No...” I said. She was right 
after all. Neither Shizuru or I had really been doing much about our situation. We both 
really needed our friends to help us face our true feelings, and apparently a friend of a 
friend to set the whole thing in motion. “Thank you very much, Yukino-san.”</p><p>Yukino 
smiled and waved it off. “It's nothing really. Just one of many things Haruka-chan and I 
talked about this week.”</p><p>“You seem to be actually serious about this.” The sound of 
Haruka talking again drew our attention back to the arena. “I must be able to defeat you at 
your full power in front of everyone, or else it won't mean anything.”</p><p>“Thank you,” 
Shizuru replied. Her voice held fierce determination now. “But, I will take 
Natsuki.”</p><p>“Do whatever you want,” Haruka said. “However, if I 
win...”</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>Haruka cut straight into a battlecry as the match started. She 
didn't waste a moment in charging at Shizuru, who simply stood there calmly for the first 
couple seconds while Haruka crossed the distance. The only indication on her end that the 
battle had begun was the charging of her robe, as it gradually became lit up. For a split 
second, I was afraid that Shizuru wouldn't be ready for Haruka's attack in time and that she 
would be hit by it – and, knowing Haruka's reputation for strength, possibly also knocked 
out already.</p><p>I really needn't have worried. I should never have doubted Shizuru, even 
for that moment. In fact, I think every single person in the stadium underestimated just 
what she was capable of. Even when watching the numerous replays later, what she 
accomplished seemed to stretch the limits of what was humanly possible.</p><p>It took 
watching the replays many times at varying speeds in order for me to piece together exactly 
what happened after that point, it all passed so quickly. Shizuru leaped forward and 
slightly to the side in an instant. As she was moving, she materialized her element in her 
hands and extended it into a chain. At the time, I was still just learning about elements 
and how Otomes could use them, so this was the part that took me the most time and help from 
others to figure out. All I knew initially was that somehow she'd formed a chain which 
Haruka slammed into and which quickly wrapped around her.</p><p>Caught in the deathgrip of 
Shizuru's element and propelled by her own momentum and the still-firing thrusters of her 
robe, Haruka had already lost the match. Shizuru was able to angle her downwards with the 
slightest twist, sending her crashing head-first into the pillar Shizuru had been standing 
on a moment ago. Beside me, Yukino let out a concerned “Haruka-chan!” and we could see on 
our screens that the single hit took out a good 15 of Haruka's robe's 
durability.</p><p>Shizuru kept Haruka spinning in a circle, crashing her through a 
succession of pillars until she'd cleared the area around her and Haruka's durability had 
dwindled to 32. Shizuru only started spinning faster then. She started to generate winds 
around her with her robe, forming a vortex with herself at the eye. It took me a bit to 
realize that Shizuru had actually started to spin in the opposite direction from how she was 
whirling Haruka around, rapidly passing the element between her hands. As the winds followed 
Shizuru, this meant that Haruka was being swung directly into them and being hit by the 
numerous loose rocks and chunks of the pillars that Shizuru's vortex had picked up, her 
durability slowly being chipped away.</p><p>Once Shizuru seemed to have reached her limit, 
she changed her tactic and started swinging Haruka in what at first seemed to be a haphazard 
manner while circling around in the winds herself. However, her intent there was to generate 
a funnel of wind blowing downwards in the center of her vortex – a fact which took many 
replays to become apparent. When it was fully formed, she whipped Haruka into it just as she 
released her element and jumped on top of her. A blast of energy burst from her feet, 
combining with the winds and the momentum of Haruka's swing to send her plummeting downwards 
at a pace too fast for the naked eye to follow.</p><p>Dust billowed out from Haruka's crash, 
with the sounds of Yukino's concerned whimpering barely being audible barely entering my 
consciousness. “Trias number one, Shizuru Viola, is victorious!” The Gakuencho announced. 
Our screens flashed the results: Shizuru had won with 100 of her robe's durability intact in 
a mere 17 seconds. We later checked the records of past battles and found out that this set 
a record only rivaled by one of Lena Sayers' battles, which was over in only 10 seconds but 
which had caused her own robe to overload and lose most of its durability.</p><p>As the dust 
cleared, Shizuru was revealed hovering serenely in the center of the arena, a graceful smile 
on her face. She spun around slowly until she came to face me, when she stopped and allowed 
a rare genuine smile to spread across her face. As I met her eyes, she brought a hand up to 
her mouth and gently blew me a kiss. The sounds of the crowd in reaction to her win and this 
action would have been deafening if I'd paid it any attention. All that crossed my mind was 
the sensation of a blush rising to my cheeks and one of the happiest realizations in my 
life.</p><p>Shizuru Viola was now officially my girlfriend.</p><hr><p>“I hate Mondays,” 
Midori al Aswad muttered as her friend, Youko Helene, delicately opened the casing on the 
REM she wore on her wrist. She sighed and leaned back, resting her head against her free 
hand.</p><p>“It's Friday,” Natsuki said, perhaps a bit more harshly than Midori deserved. 
Still, it was very important to her that today was Friday, so she could have the entire 
weekend together with Shizuru after tonight. The fact that she still had to work was also 
contributing to her frustrations, though it could have been worse. At least she was lucky 
enough to be able to work on the final steps of a special project today, which was a fair 
bit more interesting – not to mention it would be useful for an extra surprise for 
Shizuru.</p><p>“Right, whatever,” Midori said, glaring back at Natsuki for a moment before 
rolling her eyes.</p><p>Youko continued working on opening a particularly delicate part 
before she had a moment to spare concentration on the conversation. “Don't mind her, 
Gakuencho. We just have weekly appointments on Mondays, and that's all she can think of to 
start conversation. If you hadn't interrupted her, she would have continued by insisting 
that it isn't this part of the day she hates; it's just how everyone else acts, like they 
don't have to pull their all into work since they just got off of a weekend.”</p><p>Midori 
smirked awkwardly at this. “Am I really that predictable? Must be getting into a rut. All 
this peace wears on me.”</p><p>“Peace?” Natsuki said. “We're barely two weeks off of a 
world-threatening crisis.”</p><p>“Two boring weeks,” Midori replied. “And a boring year 
before that in which I fell into a rut. Not that I was even able to do that much to help 
out. Even when the five Columns were mostly out of commission, did anyone come asking me to 
help fill in the gap? Nope. But now, when you need a peak at Aswad's secrets, here I 
am.”</p><p>“You really just need to learn to enjoy life itself, Midori,” Youko admonished 
her friend. Finished with her work, she started closing up Midori's REM. “Just look at our 
Gakuencho, the famed Ice Queen of Garderobe...”</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>Youko smirked at 
Natsuki's outburst. “Fine, the famed Ice-Queen-who-isn't-Miss-Maria.” Natsuki growled at 
this, but Youko ignored her and continued. “When the world's in crisis, she leads the 
defense, but she knows just how to relax with her love when it's all over. It actually seems 
that things have been quite eventful between her and the Graceful Amethyst these last weeks, 
including a very special question today that she's really going all out 
for.”</p><p>Natsuki's eyes widened at the revelation that Youko knew about her plans. She'd 
wanted to keep things as secretive as possible to make sure nothing slipped to Shizuru. 
“How'd you...?”</p><p>“Don't worry,” Youko said. She picked up the ring she was working and 
turned to Natsuki. “I haven't told anyone. It's just that Sara needed a <i>very</i> good 
reason for what she wanted me to do. And with Irina needing to make up an excuse to get off 
of work, you really should have just told me you were planning to propose today in the first 
place.”</p><p>“Propose... wait...” Midori looked over at Natsuki, idly rubbing her wrist. 
“Does that mean you and the Third Column are...?”</p><p>Natsuki stayed silent while she 
tried to internalize her frustration and not snap at Youko. It was still awkward seeing 
other people discuss her relationship, even if they weren't judging it. She used to really 
hate feeling like she was on display like this, but it was becoming more tolerable with 
time. She had no choice but to learn to live with it now, though. It was all out in the open 
and there was no turning back. She couldn't try to convince people that she was just 
Shizuru's heya-gakkari like she did back in school.</p><p>“You didn't notice?” Youko asked 
incredulously, turning back to Midori. “It's been all they can talk about on the news, even 
pushing out the reports on the aftermath of the battles. Shizuru and Natsuki – or 'Shiznat' 
as they've started to call it – is the biggest thing of the century.”</p><p>Midori grunted 
and shrugged. “Eh, not my thing.”</p><p>“Well, I've had enough of your moping. We're going 
out tonight, and I'm going to teach you how to enjoy peace to the fullest. And no saying 
'no'; I'll drag you if I have to.”</p><p>“You will have to if you plan to drive,” Midori 
retorted.</p><p>“Ugh, will you two shut it already?” Natsuki let out, exasperated. “You 
sound like you're married.”</p><p>“Sorry, just making up for lost bickering time,” Youko 
said. “Now come on, Midori, let's try out the prototype.”</p>
