*Rearranged: Chapter One*

The snow was falling gently to the ground on a cold December evening. It 
was already blanketing the ground, reflecting the glow from each street 
lamp that lined the empty street. A lone girl with black hair and green 
eyes stood leaning against one of those lamp posts with her arms 
crossed. Next to her a black racing motorcycle was parked, gradually 
collecting a thin layer of snow as the minutes passed.

She glanced around her surroundings, perceiving the shadowy forms of the 
large and impressive houses that were spaced along the streets of this 
upscale neighborhood. The sound of distant footsteps lightly crunching 
the snow alerted the girl, and she quickly turned her head as her eyes 
sought out the approaching person. It was a girl with light brown hair 
and burgundy eyes; eyes that were focused solely on the black-haired 
girl in front of her.

&quot;Natsuki...,&quot; she whispered as she neared the girl. Once she was close 
to her she pulled her into a tight embrace, burying her face into the 
girl&#39;s silky black tresses.

&quot;Sh-Shizuru!&quot; Natsuki exclaimed, a blush tinting her cheeks. Rather than 
pushing the taller girl away as she would have once done, her arms 
instead encircled her as she returned the hug.

&quot;I&#39;ve missed you, Natsuki.&quot;

Natsuki sighed, &quot;We just saw each other yesterday.&quot;

&quot;Yes, but I want to be with you all the time,&quot; Shizuru replied, no trace 
of the usual teasing in her voice.

&quot;We can&#39;t-,&quot; Natsuki started, but silenced herself. Instead she 
admitted, &quot;Me too.&quot;

Shizuru smiled a sad smile as she placed her gloved hand on Natsuki&#39;s 
cheek. &quot;We need to get going,&quot; Natsuki said as she motioned toward her 
bike. Shizuru nodded as she climbed on behind Natsuki and wrapped her 
arms around her.

Shizuru smiled into her hair, tightening her hold on the other girl. 
&quot;Tell me again that you love me,&quot; she asked pleadingly.

&quot;I-I love you,&quot; Natsuki mumbled quietly, still unable to say those words 
very easily. After all, it had only been one week since she had realized 
her feelings for Shizuru...

***Flashback***

Saturday evening Shizuru had shown up on her doorstep out of breath, 
with tears streaming down her face. She had rushed to see Natsuki as 
soon as she possibly could, after finding out from her parents that they 
had arranged for her to be married to the son of a wealthy Kyoto 
businessman. The omiai was to be held in two months, and they were not 
accepting her protests. It would be a good match, they said, that would 
tie their families together and build a strong partnership between their 
respective companies. She had pleaded with them to call it off, but they 
told her that she had no choice but to go through with it, and that she 
would grow to accept and possibly love her new husband with time.

Natsuki listened to Shizuru tell her all of this as they sat together on 
her couch, growing angry at the thought that Shizuru&#39;s parents would be 
so controlling and manipulative of their daughter&#39;s future. Another 
emotion had blossomed in her chest as well, besides the feelings of 
anger. She couldn&#39;t pinpoint exactly what it was, but as she watched 
Shizuru sobbing into her chest, clutching onto her desperately, she knew 
that she never wanted anyone to take Shizuru from her. The 
possessiveness of that thought shocked her, but she realized that this 
was what she truly felt about the girl that had been her closest friend 
throughout high school.

So she had held Shizuru to her chest tightly, and told her that she 
would never let that happen, that the omiai would never take place and 
that she would do anything to protect her. And when Shizuru had pulled 
back to look at Natsuki&#39;s face, Natsuki&#39;s heart almost broke at the 
scared and hopeful look in the other girl&#39;s tear-filled eyes. Without 
stopping to think it through, she leaned down and softly kissed 
Shizuru&#39;s trembling lips. Shizuru responded almost immediately, 
foregoing her surprise at the other girl&#39;s actions in order to finally 
do what she had always wanted. They kissed gently for several seconds, 
lips pressing tentatively against one another. Though they had shared 
one mutual kiss before, somehow both of them felt it was different this 
time.

When they pulled apart, they looked at one another with heavy-lidded 
eyes and blushing cheeks. Natsuki paused to wipe the tears off of 
Shizuru&#39;s face, the feel of her soft skin causing a surge of electricity 
to run through her fingertips and up her arm. In the back of her mind 
she thought about how she&#39;d never felt this way before when she&#39;d 
touched Shizuru, but those thoughts were soon pushed aside as Shizuru 
threaded her fingers through Natsuki&#39;s hair to the back of her head, 
bringing her down for another kiss. This time the kiss was less gentle 
and more demanding, and Natsuki tilted her head to accommodate the kiss. 
She felt Shizuru&#39;s mouth open slightly, so she followed suit and their 
tongues met, slowly gliding across one another. This new sensation 
caused Natsuki to take a deep breath through her nose, and she moved her 
hands from Shizuru&#39;s shoulders to around her back, pulling her closer. 
Shizuru moaned into the kiss, quickly losing herself to the passion that 
was enveloping them.

Needing air, they broke the kiss after several moments, each breathing 
heavily as they rested their foreheads against one another. When she was 
able to catch her breath, Shizuru looked at Natsuki, her eyes dark and 
glinting with desire.

&quot;Natsuki, please...&quot;

&quot;Shizuru...&quot;

&quot;Let me touch you, please?&quot;

Natsuki nodded, making an &#39;mm&#39; sound in affirmation of Shizuru&#39;s 
request. The older girl then slowly pushed Natsuki onto her back on the 
couch, propping herself up over her on her elbows. She then lowered her 
lips to the other girl&#39;s, initiating a slow yet intense kiss, her tongue 
exploring every corner of Natsuki&#39;s mouth. Breaking the kiss, Shizuru 
moved down to Natsuki&#39;s neck, placing light kisses from her jaw to her 
collarbone at first and then opening her mouth to lick and suckle the 
places she&#39;d already kissed.

Natsuki couldn&#39;t contain the moan that escaped from her throat as she 
writhed under the Shizuru&#39;s ministrations. She ran her hands up 
Shizuru&#39;s back, grasping her tightly and causing Shizuru to smile 
against her neck. Still lavishing attention on Natsuki&#39;s neck, Shizuru 
slowly brought her right hand up the side of Natsuki&#39;s ribcage and 
grazed the underside of her breast with the pad of her thumb. Meeting no 
resistance from the younger girl, she moved her hand to cup Natsuki&#39;s 
breast fully, earning a gasp from the girl as she arched her back and 
pressed harder into Shizuru&#39;s palm.

After several more minutes of kissing and fondling, Natsuki sensed the 
situation was getting out of control. Reigning herself in, she tore her 
lips from Shizuru&#39;s and said, &quot;Wait...&quot;

Shizuru looked at her with confused eyes, but obeyed her request and 
lifted herself off of Natsuki, both moving to sit facing each other. 
Natsuki moved to speak, but the sight of Shizuru&#39;s swollen lips, glazed 
eyes, tousled hair, and heaving chest caused her to momentarily lose her 
train of thought.

&quot;You&#39;re so beautiful,&quot; she murmured, as she moved in for another heated 
kiss. They kissed each other&#146;s mouths teasingly, intermittently kissing 
and caressing, allowing their ragged breathing to return to an almost 
normal rate.

Finally, Natsuki pulled away, cupping Shizuru&#39;s face with one hand and 
grasping Shizuru&#39;s hand with the other. As they calmed down and came 
back to reality, the gravity of Shizuru&#39;s predicament came crashing back 
down on them.

With what she hoped was a determined look, Natsuki said, &quot;I promise you, 
we&#39;ll figure something out and you won&#39;t have to marry that guy.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Natsuki, you don&#39;t know how much your help means to me.&quot; 
Shizuru then managed a pained smile as she said, &quot;Well if I do end up 
marrying him, at least I&#39;ll have known what it&#39;s like to see you look at 
me like you did tonight; like you could actually feel--&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Natsuki interrupted. &quot;Don&#39;t say things like that! I promised you 
that it won&#39;t happen didn&#39;t I? Just trust me, ok? Do you really think I 
could let someone else have you now? Now that I know I lo--&quot; Blushing, 
she stopped herself and turned her face away from Shizuru, unable to 
voice her newly realized feelings.

Smiling with the knowledge of what Natsuki was going to say, Shizuru 
simply said, &quot;Ok, I trust you.&quot;

They looked at each other for a few moments until Shizuru sighed and 
said, &quot;Well, I should probably return home. I&#39;m sure my parents are 
upset that I left so suddenly without letting them know where I was 
going.&quot; She then stood up, offering her hand to Natsuki as she stood up 
as well.

They walked to Natsuki&#39;s apartment door and as Shizuru turned to Natsuki 
to say goodbye, the other girl grabbed both of her hands in hers and 
said, &quot;It&#39;s going to be fine. Listen, how about you come over to my 
place every couple days and we&#39;ll come up with a plan about how to get 
you out of this? Just tell your parents that you&#39;re coming over to hang 
out with me, and then they won&#39;t have to worry that you&#39;re going out to 
see some other boyfriend or something and they won&#39;t get suspicious.&quot;

&quot;Alright, that sounds like a good idea, my smart little Natsuki,&quot; she 
teased, causing the younger girl to blush yet again. She then suddenly 
pulled Natsuki into an embrace and whispered into her ear, &quot;I love you, 
Natsuki.&quot;

Before she could respond, Shizuru claimed her lips in a fiery kiss that 
left them breathless. As she opened the door and stepped out into the 
chilly night air, Natsuki called her name softly, &quot;Shizuru...&quot;

Shizuru looked at her questioningly, making Natsuki too embarrassed to 
look her in the eye. She still managed to say the three words that she 
had intended on saying though, and she quietly stated them: &quot;I, I love 
you too, Shizuru.&quot;

A happy smile graced Shizuru&#39;s face as she walked away from Natsuki&#39;s 
door. The smile quickly faded, however, as she thought about the 
inevitability of her impending marriage. She knew Natsuki would try 
everything she could to help her, but knowing her own parents, she also 
knew that it was futile to resist their wishes...

***End Flashback***

Shizuru clutched tighter to Natsuki&#39;s waist as they sped on her 
motorcycle towards her apartment for the third time that week. They had 
yet to come up with a realistic plan to avert the marriage that was to 
be held in less than two months, but Natsuki was still positive that she 
would reach a solution. Shizuru always smiled and told her that she was 
sure she would, even though the logical part of her brain was telling 
her it was impossible.

Part of her was comforted, however, by Natsuki&#39;s acceptance and return 
of her love, something she had wished for for years now. She still 
couldn&#39;t quite believe that it wasn&#39;t a dream when she was wrapped up in 
Natsuki&#39;s arms and kissing her passionately. They hadn&#39;t gone any 
further than they had that first night, but Shizuru was content with 
that...for now. Eventually she was sure that she would need more from 
her dark-haired companion, but she wasn&#39;t going to risk their blossoming 
relationship by making any demands just yet.

Natsuki turned her head towards her after they turned another corner. 
&quot;Almost there,&quot; she said, as they zoomed off into the darkness.
