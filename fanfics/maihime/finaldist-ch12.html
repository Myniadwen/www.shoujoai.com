<p>White. Just white.</p>
<p>Then a low beeping. Constant, like a heart beat.</p>
<p>The smell of sterile cleanliness.</p>
<p>The taste of plastic.</p>
<p>It was all followed by the feeling of a soft warmth that was at the same time oddly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Turning  her head to the side, tired jade orbs focused on a black monitor with  green pulsing lines running across the screen. It was the source of the  beeping, the girl decided, before turning her gaze back to the white  above.</p>
<p>That was when she suddenly noticed it…the sensation of  cool metal covering her left appendage, accompanied by a dull, constant  ache. She lifted her arm to inspect the limb, and when she did, was  presented with lackluster grey rather than pink flesh, her still foggy  brain unable to entirely comprehend what she was looking at. Attempting  to move one of the fingers, all she earned was a searing pain rippling  down her entire forearm. She tried to swallow, but found it  surprisingly difficult, like there was something obstructing her  airway. With her good arm, she reached for her mouth only to feel  smooth plastic, curious fingers following where it led.</p>
<p>Like a light in the darkness, realization suddenly struck the girl, her eyes immediately widening.</p>
<p><em>Panic. Fear. Uncertainty. Pain. Panic! PANIC!</em></p>
<p>Her  heart raced, and the machine by the bed beeped faster and louder. She  clawed at the tube that was inserted into her nose and mouth, painfully  ripping it away and gagging herself in the process before being  consumed in a fit of coughing that left her gasping for breath. Next,  her eyes fell on the I.V. taped to her arm, her intense awareness of  the needle just beneath her skin increasing by the second. She could <em>feel</em> it inside of her…pumping god knows what into her system. With her metal  claw of a left arm, she reached for the thing, and with a whimper from  the pain of the movement, she swiftly pulled the catheter out.</p>
<p>By  now she was hyperventilating, her breaths quick and shaky, her entire  body seeming to take on a nervous twitch. She swung her legs over the  side of the bed, her bare feet touching the cool tile floor below,  sitting now rather than laying down.</p>
<p><em>Neck…Chest…Itching…</em></p>
<p>The  dark-haired girl’s trembling fingers scratched at the rough gauze on  the right side of her neck, peeling it, and the medical tape around it,  from her tender skin.</p>
<p>“Whoa, whoa, hold it!” a voice exclaimed as  the door to the room was suddenly thrust open, and the girl inside  immediately stood, backing up against the far was like a cornered  animal.</p>
<p>“J-Just calm down…I’m here to help, Natsuki.”</p>
<p>“<em>He knows my name? Why does he look familiar?”</em></p>
<p>“It’s me, Jaxen.”</p>
<p>Her brow furrowed, “Jaxen…from the enemy camp…”</p>
<p>“That’s right, me and my buddy Finias helped free you and the other captured soldiers, remember?”</p>
<p>Taking  a moment to process the information, Natsuki slowly came to realize  that it all added up, “The fighting had started…I…ran into Bardas…”</p>
<p>“Mmh. We found you not too far from his body—“</p>
<p>“Then how did I get here?” the girl cut him off, “Wherever <em>here</em> is.”</p>
<p>“The  doctors did some quick patch-up work on you, and when you stabilized,  we transported you to this hospital in Seris since it’s the most  advanced in the country.”</p>
<p>“How come I don’t remember any of this?”</p>
<p>“Well, you…you’ve been in a light coma for the past three weeks. You nearly gave me a heart attack when I came in to visit.”</p>
<p>A look of pure confusion washed over the girl’s face as her entire body seemed to slacken.</p>
<p>Her gaze fell to her arm, “Wh-What…?”</p>
<p>“Look,  I’m sure you have a lot of questions,” the male gently stated, “but  right now you need to rest and reserve your strength. I’ll go get  Finias since he’s the doctor that’s been treating you, so in the  meantime, please, lie back down.”</p>
<p>After the man had quietly  departed, Natsuki followed his instruction and climbed back onto the  plain bed, not bothering with slipping under the thin sheets as her  confused mind continued to race.</p>

The  next couple of days were indeed busy ones for the ever-recovering girl,  filled with examinations, questions, explanations, and countless  stories from different sources on just what had happened during her  unexpected slumber. From what she gathered, it seemed to go something  like this:
<p>During her last torture session, it became aware that something wasn’t entirely <em>normal</em> about her body, which inevitably caused Bardas to want to send her to  Seris to be investigated by the higher-ups. Rather than send Natsuki to  her certain death, Jaxen had informed Jousuke and the others of what  was happening, and the plan to bombard the Noble’s camp was hastened to  the point of them taking action before any backup had arrived. Luckily  for the small group, however, the entire Resistance force showed up  right before they started their plot, and with the help of the fighter  plane in their possession, they ram shacked the entire encampment.  Miraculously emerging the victor in the outmatched battle, the  Resistance soldiers soon learned of even greater news. The attacks on  the capital had been successful as well, and a ceasefire had been  issued for both sides.</p>
<p>As for her comatose state, Finias had  explained, it was probably due to the immense stress her body was under  because of her various injuries. The nano-machines in her body were  apparently the only thing that had kept her alive as they worked to  piece together her tattered body.</p>
<p>The device on her left limb, affectionately known as <em>“the claw”</em> around the hospital,was being used in the healing process of her  shattered arm. It, along with the pins that were placed internally and  externally along the bones, was setting them in place so they could  heal properly. The doctor had showed her how to take the device off,  but being such a lengthy and cumbersome task, and not a very pretty  sight to behold either, Natsuki opted to just leave the thing on until  it was time to <em>permanently</em> take it off, which apparently would be in a couple of months depending on the healing process.</p>
<p>Needless  to say, the young doctor was quite fascinated with the nano-machines in  the girl’s blood. Saeko had apparently informed Finias of her stay at  Garderobe, but the man was respectable enough, under Natsuki’s  dangerous icy glare that is, not to take any of the precious technology  for Vedel’s top scientists to examine.</p>
<p>Speaking of her mother,  Saeko Kruger had been quite busy since the end of the fighting. Now  everything seemed to be wrapped up in the courts, both sides tirelessly  working on negotiations so further bloodshed would not be necessary.  Saeko represented the Resistance, leading the other politicians on her  side with pure determination. During the time of her absence, Jousuke  had kept Natsuki company even though she was sleeping a majority of the  time those first couple of days.</p>
<p>After an additional week spent  in the hospital, Natsuki had received her official approval of dispatch  from Finias, whose only additional requirement, state of health aside,  was that the girl visit him and Jaxen every now and then when she had  the time.</p>
<p>Squinting as she stepped out into the sunlight, Natsuki  was not only sporting a sling for her left arm, but also the new  official army uniform for the Republic of Vedel, it’s royal blue  material crisp and clean, not to mention a long awaited upgrade from  the flimsy uniforms of the Resistance. In it, she stood proudly by her  uncle who was dressed in similar fashion.</p>
<p>“So, what do you want to do now that you’re free?” the man inquired, looking down at his bandaged niece.</p>
<p>“Is mom in another Senate meeting right now?”</p>
<p>“Most likely. We could still swing by though. Why? What’s up?”</p>
<p>“I need to talk to her about something important…”</p>
<p>“Which is…?”</p>
<p>“Returning to Garderobe.”</p>
<p>“What?! But things are finally starting to look up here. We’ve finally won the peace we’ve been fighting for.”</p>
<p>“I know, but I just kind of dropped everything when I came running back home…”</p>
<p>“Unfinished business, eh?”</p>
<p>“I guess you could call it that,” Natsuki replied with a laugh.</p>
<p>With  a disheartened sigh, the older man began walking, “Alright…but Saeko’s  not going to be happy with this. She was expecting that you’d stick  around…at least for a little while.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I think I can handle her.”</p>

<strong>Chapter Notes</strong>:
<p>1. I can’t even begin to explain what I imagine “<em>the claw” </em>looking  like, but to get an idea, go check out the photos section of my xanga  (you can find the link on my profile page). The image for the new  uniform is there as well, which is actually taken from Star Trek. And <em>NO</em>, I am not a Trekky, but my aunts are XD</p>
