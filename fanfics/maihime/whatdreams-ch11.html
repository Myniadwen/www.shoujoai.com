<h1>What Dreams May Come (part 11 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a>

<a href="../maihime/whatdreams-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><p>Natsuki’s Resolve</p><hr><i>Ara, Natsuki, I have
to say, I’m getting really nervous here. What could you be planning
for me tonight? You’ve been in your room preparing for quite a
while already. Is it that elaborate, or is something else going on?
You were really courageous about your feelings tonight, I wonder if
you might now have run out and are in there worrying and trying to
psyche yourself up again. I hope not, but if you are, don’t worry.
It’s alright for you to be afraid.</i></p><p><i>I’m afraid too,
you know. Yes, the mighty, unshakeable Fujino Shizuru is admitting to
being afraid. Only you can do this to me, Natsuki. I’m afraid that
I might lose control of myself and push you into something you aren’t
ready for – though if your behavior tonight wasn’t just a
temporary spurt of confidence, you’re probably ready for a lot more
than I was expecting. I’m also afraid that something might go
wrong, and our first night together as a couple will be ruined.</i></p><p><i>But then a 
thought
like that passes through my mind, and giddiness overwhelms the fear
and nervousness. We’re a couple now, or at least we will be in only
a few minutes. You’re my girlfriend. My dreams that I’ve kept to
myself for so long are finally coming true. Natsuki is finally mine.
Thoughts like that are what keep me going, why I’m going to stay
here and work to make it as perfect as possible. I hope thinking
about me like that makes you just as happy.</i></p><p><i>I want to do
everything to make you feel happy, Natsuki. If you’re ready and
will let me, I’ll make this a night to remember for you. It might
not all have been through proper means, but I know a lot about how
your body responds to different types of caresses, and I believe I
could use that to bring you all the way to the brink of ecstasy.</i></p><p><i>But I can see 
how
that prospect might be a bit frightening to you. It’s a bit
frightening to me to think about letting you do all that to me, as
well. Don’t worry, I can wait until I know you’re ready. It will
be better that way in any case; there won’t be any chance of you
having regrets.</i></p><p><i>Is that it then,
Natsuki? Are you sitting in your room afraid of this very thing right
now? I really hope not, but I can’t help but fear it. You’ve been
in there for so long, it can’t all be simple preparation, can it?
Okay, I have to go check on you now, and try to reassure you if you
need it, I’m getting too worried to leave you alone any longer. I
know I’m probably just fretting over nothing, but it’s just
because I care, so please don’t be mad.</i></p><p><i>Your 
girlfriend,</i></p><p><i>Shizuru</i></p></p><hr>“Natsuki?” Shizuru
said as she knocked on the door to Natsuki’s bedroom. “Is
everything alright in there?”</p></p><p>“Yes! Uh, yeah,
Shizuru, it’s fine,” Natsuki called out from her room.
Nervousness was evident in her voice, and Shizuru guessed that she
was likely blushing.</p><p><i>So is that it then,
Natsuki? Is it nervousness holding you back? I’m sorry. I guess
it’s not surprising that all this courage you’ve shown tonight
would run out sooner or later. You’ve done well enough for tonight,
Natsuki. Don’t feel you have to push yourself to do more.</i></p><p>“Ara, it’s alright,
Natsuki,” Shizuru said, trying to reassure the girl without being
too obvious about it and further embarrassing her. “I’ll wait as
long as it takes for you to be ready.” <i>There you go, you can
interpret that whichever way you want, Natsuki.</i></p><p>“What? No, I said it
was fine, Shizuru. I’m just about ready,” Natsuki said. “Sorry
it’s taking so long, but I’ll explain later.” The nervousness
had dropped from Natsuki’s voice, and Shizuru wondered whether it
was because of her words, or if she’d just misinterpreted it
before.</p><p><i>Ara, I guess it
doesn’t matter, </i>Shizuru thought as a smile spread across her
face. <i>What matters is that she’s ready</i>. She walked back and
took a seat to wait for Natsuki, her heart starting to race in
anticipation. It was all she could do to keep her nerves under
control as she waited. It was finally happening. Natsuki was finally
going to admit to her feelings.</p><p>Before long, Natsuki’s
door opened, revealing the object of Shizuru’s dreams in the
doorway. Shizuru had been thinking she might have changed her outfit,
but she was still wearing the same casual clothes she’d had on
earlier – though they did appear to have been shifted about
somewhat, as if Natsuki had tried changing and then decided against
it and reverted back. It didn’t matter though; Natsuki managed to
be striking whatever she was wearing.</p><p>“Um, Shizuru, would
you like to come into my room?” Natsuki asked. There was just a
hint of nervousness to her voice, but she seemed to be mostly in
control of herself.</p><p>“Ara, is Natsuki
inviting me into her bed?” Shizuru teased as she got up and
approached Natsuki. “How could I refuse an offer such as that?”</p><p>Natsuki didn’t blush
as Shizuru had expected, instead just chuckling and rolling her eyes.
“There’s just no good place for us to sit together out there. I
thought my bed would be better for that.”</p><p>Shizuru gave a pout as
she stopped in front of Natsuki. It was nice to see her being
confident, but she was starting to miss seeing her blushes. “Ikezu.
What am I going to have to do to see one of Natsuki’s adorable
blushes?” Either her tactic finally worked or Natsuki decided to
relent. Either way, Shizuru was pleased to see Natsuki’s cheeks
light up. Her pout turned into a grin as she said, “Thank you”
and gave Natsuki a quick peck on the cheek.</p><p>Natsuki’s blush
deepened at this for a moment, but she quickly regained control of
herself. “Shizuru…” she said, trying to sound exasperated, but
it came out more as simply amused. “Come on, let’s get to my bed
now.” Natsuki went ahead and sat down by her pillow, patting her
hand on the spot that Shizuru had occupied during their previous
encounters in this room.</p><p>Shizuru’s mind
drifted back to those past experiences as she took her own seat.
They’d shared their first mutual kiss on this bed, and their second
as well if she counted Natsuki’s getting into that one as making it
mutual. She’d also opened herself up to Natsuki here and told her
about the feelings she’d hidden so long. And after that, it was
where Natsuki had finally decided on her own feelings. Now, it was
going to be the location of their first kiss as a couple, if not
more.</p><p>“Shizuru?” Natsuki
said, breaking Shizuru out of her thoughts. When Shizuru looked over
at her friend, she continued. “I know what you’re expecting me to
say to you now, and I will, don’t worry. But there’s something I
need to talk about with you first.”</p><p>Shizuru gave Natsuki a
reassuring smile and gazed into her eyes. “Of course, Natsuki. We
can talk about whatever you want.”</p><p>Natsuki matched
Shizuru’s smile, and some of the nervousness in her eyes faded.
“It’s about you, Shizuru. I know how you’ve been lately. Aside
from being happy about how things are going with me, you’ve been
regretting lots of things.”</p><p>Shizuru’s expression
broke a little and she looked away from Natsuki. “How did Natsuki
know?”</p><p>“Well, that letter
you sent me was a pretty big hint,” Natsuki said. “After that, I
started seeing it in your eyes. You hid it pretty well, but I know it
was there.” Natsuki moved over to sit up against Shizuru and
wrapped an arm around her. “I don’t want you to end up regretting
tonight, thinking you pushed me into something I wasn’t ready for,”
she said.</p><p>Emotion swelled through
Shizuru at this intimate contact and concern from her friend. She was
barely able to keep her expression steady. All she could get herself
to say was, “Natsuki…” so she let her emotions seep into the
word and speak for her. After a moment, she was able to compose
herself a bit better and she said, “I’m not going to regret
tonight, Natsuki, because I’m not going to do anything that I might
end up regretting.”</p><p>Natsuki didn’t seem
to be too satisfied with this response. She withdrew her arm from
around Shizuru and backed away a bit. Shizuru didn’t turn to watch
her, but she heard her friend rustling around a bit. “I need to be
sure though,” Natsuki said. “And I don’t want your fear to hold
you back tonight in any case. There are other reasons I’m doing
this too, but I can explain those later. For now, please just trust
me on this. I need to do it to make sure everything’s perfect.”</p><p>Shizuru turned her 
head
back to look at Natsuki. The girl had moved one leg up onto the bed
so she could better face Shizuru. Her eyes still showed a little
nervousness, but there was resolve there as well. “Natsuki?”
Shizuru said.</p><p>Natsuki grabbed
Shizuru’s near hand with her left and brought it over to her. With
her right, she placed a small rectangle of paper into it. “I’m
using my first coupon now, Shizuru. I want you to let me take control
tonight. It’s the only way I can be sure you won’t have anything
to regret, as everything is going to come from me.”</p><p>Conflicting emotions
cascaded through Shizuru’s mind at this. It was flattering that
Natsuki was as insightful as she was and cared so much, but Shizuru
knew she’d be careful and not do anything she might regret. Or
maybe that was it – did Natsuki actually want things to go that far
and know that Shizuru wouldn’t have done it without complete
reassurance? Or was she afraid Shizuru might not be able to restrain
herself and was using this as a cover to make sure she held back?</p><p>Shizuru looked up 
into
Natsuki’s eyes, trying to glean some hint as to what she meant by
this. There was nervousness, probably about hearing Shizuru’s
reaction to this, but no fear. Shizuru took a guess at her
intentions, “Natsuki, you don’t have to worry about me regretting
anything that happens tonight,” she said. <i>If you truly want it,
I have no problem giving everything for you – doing everything to
you. I’d never regret giving you pleasure like that, as long as I
know you’re certain.</i></p><p>Natsuki shook her head
lightly. “I said there were other reasons too, Shizuru. For one, I
know how you are, but I want this to be your night. You’ve been
waiting so much longer, and I’m the one who really needs to prove
her feelings in any case. Please, Shizuru.” Natsuki took Shizuru’s
hand into her own and grasped it to her heart, the coupon falling
forgotten to the bed. Her eyes met Shizuru’s, and the nervousness
had vanished from them. She was determined about this.</p><p>A deep blush formed on
Shizuru’s face as she realized what Natsuki intended. She’d
imagined what her first night with Natsuki might be like many times,
but she’d always thought she’d be the one to take charge. Natsuki
had always been so hesitant about the relationship that Shizuru just
couldn’t picture her taking over their first time. <i>Are you
trying to make up for lost time now that you’ve found your courage,
Natsuki?</i></p><p>Shizuru tried to
suppress her blush and still her now-racing heart. Natsuki’s
decision here had surprised her, and it had rekindled her
nervousness. She couldn’t let that show, though. She had to be the
strong one.</p><p>“Don’t.”</p><p>Natsuki’s voice broke
Shizuru out of her attempt to reform her mask. She looked at her
friend with inquiring eyes. “Natsuki?”</p><p>Natsuki removed one of
her hands from her grasp on Shizuru’s and brought it up to
Shizuru’s chin. She held it steady and gazed deep into Shizuru’s
eyes. “Don’t hide from me,” she said. “I want to see the real
you tonight, not the mask you put on for the world.”</p><p>Shizuru felt the walls
she put up around her heart break a little at Natsuki’s words.<i>You’re right, I shouldn’t 
be hiding from you, not anymore. But
it’s still hard.</i> It took an effort, but Shizuru was able to let
her guard down a little, and she felt herself start to tremble a
little from her nervousness.</p><p>A reassuring smile from
Natsuki helped her calm her nerves, however. “You’re so
beautiful, Shizuru,” she said. Her smile had spread to her eyes,
and her affection shone through. “Not just your façade, the
real you. Nervous, vulnerable… hopelessly in love. I just can’t
resist you like this.”</p><p>“Natsuki…”
Shizuru’s heart throbbed at the compliments from her friend, and
her fear at exposing herself faded a little more. She could barely
resist anymore herself. She wanted to take Natsuki into a passionate
kiss and let their instincts take the two of them wherever they
might.</p><p>Natsuki seemed to sense
the desire in Shizuru’s eyes. She removed her hand from Shizuru’s
chin and placed it on her shoulder. Her other hand, still interlocked
with Shizuru’s, tightened its grip tenderly. “Well, I brought you
here to tell you my decision, first and foremost. I really shouldn’t
hold off any longer. I’m sure you’ve figured it out by now
anyways, but it’s important that I say it.”</p><p>Shizuru’s heartbeat
picked up again, anticipating Natsuki’s words. She felt an urge to
try to cover up her excitement, but with an effort she suppressed it
and allowed her feelings to show through on her face. To be sure she
wouldn’t succumb to an instinct to look away, she brought her leg
up on the bed so that her position mirrored Natsuki’s. She’d have
to make a much more significant change in position to look away now.</p><p>“I’ve been 
feeling
weird sensations when it comes to you for quite a while,” Natsuki
said. Her eyes seemed to be keeping close track of Shizuru’s
expression, noting every emotion she allowed to pass through. “I
suspected it might have been love, but I had nothing to compare it
to, so I couldn’t know for sure. It wasn’t until I asked you what
you felt that I finally figured it out. You felt all the same things
I did, so I knew then that my feelings were the same as yours. I’m
pretty sure you figured it out then as well.”</p><p>Shizuru gave a weak nod
at this. The motion made her realize that she’d let tears start to
well up in her eyes, but she made no move to wipe them away. Hearing
Natsuki finally say all this, perfectly confident about everything,
was causing her to overflow with emotions. She didn’t know if she’d
have been able to maintain her mask even if she’d been trying to at
that moment. It was better this way, anyway. Natsuki was opening
herself up to her, it was the least she could do to reveal her
emotions in turn.</p><p>“I’m sorry I made
you wait so long, Shizuru,” Natsuki continued. She seemed to have
noticed the tears pooling in Shizuru’s eyes, and it had caused her
smile to warm up a little. “But I wanted this moment to be perfect
for you. You’ve already been waiting so long, I wanted to make sure
it was finally worth it. Getting over my flu so I wouldn’t end up
infecting you was only part of it; I also needed the time to work my
courage up. I really don’t really know where all this courage is
coming from, to be honest, or how long it will last, but I’m going
to take advantage of it while it’s here.”</p><p>A warmth filled
Shizuru’s chest at these sentiments, and the tears finally managed
to fall from her eyes. “Natsuki is too sweet,” she said.</p><p>Natsuki brought a hand
up to Shizuru’s face and brushed away the tears that had trailed
down her cheeks, bringing another blush to Shizuru’s face. Natsuki
finally brought her hand to rest cradling Shizuru’s cheek. “Natsuki
can’t resist you any longer,” she said with a smirk. “Are you
okay with this Shizuru? I know with the coupon and all you might feel
obligated, but I really don’t want to force y-”</p><p>“I want this,”
Shizuru said, bringing her own hand up to cradle Natsuki’s cheek.
“I want you, Natsuki, and I’m yours for the night if you want me
as well.”</p><p>Natsuki’s eyes glowed
with delight. “I do,” she said, and she wasted no further time
with words. She released her hand from Shizuru’s and brought it
around the back of her neck to pull her in. Her other hand drifted
around behind Shizuru as well to secure her hold as their lips met
and she proceeded to devour Shizuru as best as she could.</p><p>When Natsuki’s lips
met hers, Shizuru’s conscious mind gave in to her instincts, and
she lost herself to the sensations she was experiencing. Her chest
ached in need, and she tried to satisfy it as best as she could in
the kiss, bringing her own arms around Natsuki in turn to keep her
close. She relished the feeling of Natsuki’s lips against hers and
explored the other girl’s mouth with her tongue, while Natsuki did
the same to her. She could feel more tears dripping down her cheeks
now, but she was beyond caring.</p><p>As they eventually
parted to catch their breaths, Natsuki panted out to Shizuru, “I
almost forgot, but I promised you a little surprise.” Her lips
curled up into a devious smile that made Shizuru proud of her
influence on the girl as she pulled back from the kiss and got up
from the bed.</p><p>Shizuru let out a
giggle at Natsuki’s determination to go through with all of her
plans, even to the extent of breaking from their kiss, momentarily
surprising herself with how easily she was letting her emotions out
now. “You’ve already done more than enough to surprise me
tonight, Natsuki,” she said. “I’m not sure if I could take much
more.”</p><p>Natsuki put on a mask
of seriousness. “Quiet,” she said sternly. “Now close your
eyes.” Shizuru obliged, also putting an expectant grin on her face
as she wondered what Natsuki might have been planning for her. After
a short period of some rustling noises in front of Shizuru, Natsuki
said, “Alright, open your eyes now.”</p><p>A blush rushed to
Shizuru’s face as her eyes opened to take in the sight of Natsuki
clad only in the teddy she’d bought earlier that evening and
striking an alluring pose for Shizuru. Her back was arched with her
bust thrust out and her head thrown back. Her fingers were splayed on
her upper thighs. The whole pose gave the impression that she were
already in the throws of ecstasy. The lacy black material of the
teddy seemed molded to fit her torso and emphasize her perfect
proportions – especially in this pose – while leaving her shapely
arms and legs bare.</p><p>Shizuru didn’t know
what part was more surprising: that Natsuki had overcome her usual
modesty to wear such an outfit and make such a pose without even a
blush on her face, or the she’d somehow anticipated her trip with
Shizuru to the lingerie store in order to incorporate it into her own
plans. “Ara, so Natsuki <i>was</i> planning to use that to seduce
me,” Shizuru said appreciatively.</p><p>Natsuki broke out into
a fit of giggles at this. Shizuru mused that she’d likely been
trying to restrain herself for some time, and had made use of the
pose to hide her face from Shizuru. When she regained some control
over herself, Natsuki responded in between giggles, “I was
originally planning to use a piece from my own collection, but when
you dropped your offer in my lap and I found this piece, I just
couldn’t resist.”</p><p><i>Aha, so that
explains it.</i> “I’m glad I could be such a help to your plans,”
Shizuru said, eying up the alluring view Natsuki’s outfit was
supplying her. As she considered the effort it must have taken for
Natsuki to put herself on display like this, she decided to try to
reassure her friend. “I don’t know where this new, courageous
Natsuki came from, but I think I’m falling in love with her.”</p><p>Natsuki’s face turned
red at this admission, and a smile grew across her face. “I could
say very much the same thing about a Shizuru who doesn’t try to
hide her emotions from me,” she teased in turn, causing Shizuru’s
face to turn an equal shade of red. “Now, lie back on the bed,”
Natsuki continued in a seductive tone, approaching Shizuru with need
in her eyes. “Courageous Natsuki wants to see just how emotional
she can make Shizuru tonight.”</p><p>Shizuru’s face went
from red to purple and a wave of heat scorched its way through her
chest as she was reminded of what Natsuki intended on doing with her.
Her heart pounding on her ears, she started to move back so she could
lie down. She’d almost made it all the way when Natsuki pounced on
her and locked her lips into another passionate kiss. Shizuru felt
her head hit the pillow as she fell back, a fact for which she was
grateful as it allowed her better leverage in returning Natsuki’s
passion.</p><p>Natsuki lifted up from
the kiss to gave into Shizuru’s eyes for a moment. In Natsuki’s
viridian orbs, Shizuru saw only love now, and she was sure that
Natsuki would see the same in hers. A smile formed on Natsuki’s
face as her eyes dropped to Shizuru’s right cheek. “Hmm, now what
do we have here?” Natsuki said teasingly. “Has Shizuru been
letting her emotions out a bit too much? Well, let’s see what I can
do about that…”</p><p>With this, Natsuki
moved her mouth over to Shizuru’s cheek and lightly pressed her
lips to it. Her tongue flicked out between them to lap up the trail
Shizuru’s earlier tears had left. She then moved her lips an inch
up Shizuru’s cheek and repeated the process. A shudder ran through
Shizuru at the feeling of Natsuki’s painfully slow voyage up her
cheek, which finally climaxed with a tender kiss on Shizuru’s
closed eye. Natsuki wasn’t finished though, as she then moved over
to Shizuru’s other cheek and repeated the process.</p><p>By the time Natsuki was
finished, Shizuru’s mind was in a haze. The girl of her dreams had
finally returned her love, and now had her pinned to her bed and was
tenderly kissing her way across Shizuru’s face in a quite
successful attempt to drive her wild. She was so lost in love for
Natsuki that she didn’t realize the girl had left her face until
she felt her hands around her ankle, slowly pulling off her sock.
Natsuki’s fingers were pressed into her, dragging along her skin
and causing another wave of shudders to pass through Shizuru’s
body.</p><p>After her sock was
finally peeled off, Natsuki picked up Shizuru’s foot in her hands
and planted a kiss on the tip of her big toe. She then placed it back
down on the bed and moved over to Shizuru’s other leg to repeat the
process. This time, she reached up far along Shizuru’s leg past her
sock to allow her fingers to drag an even longer distance. She even
started to rotate her hands around Shizuru’s leg as she pulled
down, sending the girl into a further bout of shivers.</p><p>As this sock came off,
Natsuki repeated the process of planting a kiss on Shizuru’s big
toe. She followed it up this time with another kiss just on top of
it. She slowly moved up Shizuru’s foot with a series of kisses,
reaching as far into her pant-leg as she could. With Shizuru’s
clothes providing a barrier, Natsuki brought herself more quickly up
Shizuru’s body, planting a few random kisses on her legs and belly
along the way, eventually landing on Shizuru’s mouth for another
slow, sweet kiss, bringing a wave of warmth to Shizuru’s chest.</p><p>Shizuru let out a 
groan
as Natsuki’s lips left her own, which turned into a gasp as
Natsuki’s lips landed on her neck, just above her collarbone.
Natsuki slowly worked her way up around Shizuru’s neck, causing a
series of gasps from Shizuru which turned into a desperate panting as
Natsuki suddenly switched sides and started working her way up again.</p><p>It was too much.
Shizuru didn’t know how she would be able to take much more, but
she wanted – no, needed it. “Natsuki…” she pleaded, and
brought her hands around to Natsuki’s back to pull her in. Natsuki
happily obliged, and she found a spot on Shizuru’s neck to settle
on, kissing it deeply and sucking on it. Natsuki’s teeth met her
neck and started nibbling, forcing out a moan from Shizuru as her
back arched in pleasure.</p><p>Natsuki released her
suction from this part of Shizuru’s neck and started moving lower.
When her mouth reached the collar of Shizuru’s blouse, Shizuru felt
a weight lift from her as Natsuki’s hands moved in under her torso
to work at the buttons of Shizuru’s blouse. They came undone one by
one, and Shizuru felt herself gradually becoming more exposed to
Natsuki.</p><p>She wasn’t bothered
by it; she wanted to give everything she had to Natsuki, and her body
was part and parcel of the deal. She’d already tried to bare her
emotions to the girl, and she knew that as this progressed Natsuki
would pry out the rest of them and see her truly naked, body and
soul. A wave of excitement coursed through her from knowing that she
was going to be giving this all up to Natsuki, and a wave of warmth
followed when she considered how much Natsuki wanted to see this. She
wanted to help remove her clothes to speed up the process, but she
forced herself to hold back in respect for Natsuki’s wish to be in
complete control and out of a wish to give Natsuki the gift of being
able to expose her herself.</p><p>As the last button was
undone, Shizuru propped herself up in order to assist Natsuki in
getting her arms out of the sleeves. As soon as she was free, Natsuki
threw her blouse off the bed and returned to her assault on Shizuru,
taking full advantage of the wealth of newly exposed flesh. Her lips
danced across Shizuru’s upper chest, seemingly landing at random,
but somehow it felt like Natsuki was anticipating just where Shizuru
needed her touch the most. Shizuru involuntarily released a deep moan
from the back of her throat at the barrage of pleasure Natsuki’s
kisses were bringing, and her arms wrapped around Natsuki so her
hands would have something to squeeze onto.</p><p>Before long, Natsuki
landed a kiss on the exposed portion of Shizuru’s right breast,
just above her bra. She followed this up with an identical kiss on
Shizuru’s other breast. She then returned to the first and planted
a kiss right over Shizuru’s nipple, which was agonizing in the
muted sensations due to the barrier her bra provided. This was
followed with another such kiss over Shizuru’s left breast, but
Natsuki pressed further on this one, bringing out her teeth to
lightly nibble on Shizuru’s hardened nipple through the fabric,
sending sparks of pleasure through Shizuru.</p><p>Her right breast didn’t
stay lonely for long, as Natsuki’s left hand came up to give her
nipple a light pinch, sending another jolt of electricity through
Shizuru’s body and eliciting a sharp gasp from her. Shizuru had
never hated her bra more in her life. She desperately wanted to be
rid of it and feel Natsuki’s mouth and fingers on her bare flesh.
Why did Natsuki have to be such a tease about this?</p><p>Natsuki’s mouth left
Shizuru’s left breast, though it was quickly replaced by her hand,
which started gently massaging it. Shizuru barely had the presence of
mind to wonder what Natsuki was planning to do with her mouth next
when she felt a sharp pressure on both her breasts as Natsuki used
them as leverage to push herself forward and encompass Shizuru’s
lips with her own once more.</p><p>Shizuru was lost in a
maze of pleasure from the dual assault of Natsuki’s lips caressing
her own and Natsuki’s hands kneading her breasts, but the
frustration of her bra being in the way threatened to make her snap.
It was all she could do to stop herself from removing her hands from
Natsuki’s back to take it off herself, though she suspected she’d
still have quite some trouble getting her hands under her back to
undo the clasp with Natsuki’s added weight on top of her.</p><p>Shizuru let loose a
grunt of frustration when Natsuki’s fingers once again pinched her
nipple through her bra. Natsuki seemed to respond to it, though not
by slipping her hand under Shizuru’s bra as Shizuru had hoped.
Instead, she removed her mouth from Shizuru’s lips and found a spot
on her neck to suckle. The sharp jolt of pleasure from this forced
Shizuru to arch her back and let out a gasp.</p><p>When Shizuru’s back
fell down to meet the bed again, she realized just how insightful and
devious Natsuki had been. Natsuki’s right hand must have left
Shizuru’s breast as she was distracted by the assault on her neck,
as it now lay beneath Shizuru’s back with two of its fingers deftly
unclasping her bra. The hand then grabbed her bra strap and pulled it
out to the side as Natsuki’s left hand came up to grab the other
strap from Shizuru’s shoulder.</p><p>Shizuru momentarily let
her arms unwind from around Natsuki to free her bra, which Natsuki
promptly tossed aside before plunging her mouth back to Shizuru’s
finally-freed breasts. Another grunt of frustration was forced from
Shizuru as Natsuki seemed to be unrelenting in her teasing,
purposefully avoiding Shizuru’s erect and needy nipples as her
mouth kissed and suckled a ring around her left breast and her hand
massaged the flesh of her right.</p><p>Her control over her
body fading, Shizuru felt herself starting to squirm under Natsuki’s
ministrations and idly hoped her motions would cause one of her
nipples to slip under Natsuki’s hand or mouth. She had no such
luck, though, as Natsuki seemed intent on getting back at her for
years of teasing all in one night and steadfastly avoided touching
her where she needed it most. Unable to take it anymore, she let out
an anguished, “Natsuki….”</p><p>Maybe this made Natsuki
decide she’d finally had enough, as her mouth immediately enveloped
Shizuru’s left nipple and sucked it in as her fingers
simultaneously pinched her right. Shizuru let out a throaty moan as
waves of pent-up pleasure were finally released through her body at
this. It only intensified as Natsuki’s teeth found her nipple and
lightly bit down, sending a spark straight through Shizuru’s chest.</p><p>Natsuki then moved 
her
mouth over to attend to Shizuru’s right breast, while bringing her
right hand up to keep Shizuru’s left from getting lonely. Instead
of sucking in on this one, Natsuki instead went about tenderly
caressing Shizuru’s nipple and her enflamed areola with the tip of
her tongue. A wave of tremors shot through Shizuru’s body as she
let loose a desperate series of moans. How had Natsuki ever had the
chance to get so good at this? Could her affection for Shizuru alone
be guiding her to find just the right things?</p><p>A wave of warmth shot
down through Shizuru’s chest as she considered the possibility that
Natsuki already cared that much about her. She had to, to have the
courage to do all this and to want to bring Shizuru so much pleasure.<i>Natsuki loves 
me.</i> Her mind formed its first coherent thought
in what seemed like hours. Her love still had yet to say the words,
but it didn’t matter, she was content to simply know it. Tears
leaked from Shizuru’s eyes as it felt like an invisible burden had
finally been lifted from her, all her doubts fading. Natsuki had been
right, it needed to be this way between them for her to be sure.</p><p>Shizuru wasn’t sure
if Natsuki had noticed her tears, but the girl was again at her face,
fulfilling her desperate need to kiss her in thanks for her love.
Tears continued to stream down Shizuru’s cheeks, and she out a
series of light moans into Natsuki’s mouth. <i>I love you, Natsuki.</i>

She desperately wanted to form the words and tell this to the object
of her desire, but she couldn’t muster enough control for anything
more than a pleading moan.</p><p>The feeling of smooth
flesh against her legs suddenly grabbed Shizuru’s attention. She’d
been so lost in her thoughts about Natsuki’s feelings that she
hadn’t even noticed when Natsuki had peeled off her pants. The
thought called attention to the fact that Shizuru only had one
article of clothing remaining, and the need in her body had started
to centralize to it. It was the only thing left before she’d be
completely, utterly exposed to Natsuki, her body her ultimate gift to
her lover.</p><p>Natsuki broke from the
kiss, possibly having noticed Shizuru’s distraction. “Open your
eyes, Shizuru,” she whispered. Shizuru had been so in the midst of
feeling that she’d stopped paying all attention to her vision, and
her eyes must have closed at some point. She peeled them open now to
find Natsuki’s eyes right above hers, overflowing with adoration.</p><p>As Natsuki caught
Shizuru’s eyes in her own, she slipped down and out of Shizuru’s
line of sight. Shizuru tilted her head forward to recapture her
love’s gaze, finding Natsuki sliding down her body, her head still
facing up to Shizuru’s face. Shizuru’s hands lost her grip on the
girl as her shoulders fell out of her reached, and they fell
dejectedly to her sides. Natsuki’s hands then found Shizuru’s
shoulders and started tracing their way slowly down her sides.</p><p>When Natsuki’s right
hand brushed against a small spot above Shizuru’s hip, a sudden
bolt of pleasure shot through Shizuru and she instinctively jerked
away from it. Natsuki’s face momentarily showed an expression of
shock, but it turned into a devious grin as she caught the blush that
Shizuru knew had formed on her face. “Found it,” Natsuki said
with a distinctive lilt to her voice, and her right hand reached back
up to gently caress Shizuru’s own “pleasure button.”</p><p>Shizuru started panting
desperately, and she could feel a wave of warmth filling her face and
spreading through her neck and chest. Her body started shaking
violently, and she knew that if Natsuki kept caressing that spot much
longer, she’d lose control. She really didn’t want their
experience to end so soon, but she was at Natsuki’s mercy and there
was nothing she could do to stop her. Fortunately for the moment,
Natsuki seemed to realize this as well, and she let Shizuru free from
her torturous touch and dragged her hand back down to Shizuru’s
hip.</p><p>Natsuki gave Shizuru a
moment to catch her breath and caught her eyes again. Staring up at
Shizuru’s face from her position at Shizuru’s pelvis, Natsuki
slowly slipped both of her hands into the waistband of Shizuru’s
panties. Shizuru gave Natsuki a smile to let her know she was ready,
which Natsuki promptly returned. Her eyes locked with Shizuru’s,
Natsuki slowly backed up, peeling off Shizuru’s panties and
exposing the final piece of her body to Natsuki, not that the girl
allowed her eyes to part with Shizuru’s to look at it.</p><p>As Shizuru’s panties
finally slipped off over her feet, Natsuki took a moment to stand up
and look over her naked lover. Her gaze slowly crawled across
Shizuru’s body, taking in every square inch of skin and paying
particularly close attention to those pieces she’d never had an
opportunity to see before. <i>It’s all yours, Natsuki.</i> Shizuru
felt a warmth course through her chest at her friend’s lusty
appraisal.</p><p>Eventually, Natsuki’s
gaze came to rest on Shizuru’s eyes once more. The adoration in her
eyes was still present, though it was now mixed in with deep desire.
“You’re so beautiful, Shizuru,” she said in a voice that was
almost cracking. A light blush had formed on Natsuki’s face from
the sight and her admission, though it was nothing compared to the
blush Shizuru felt forming from the compliment.</p><p>Natsuki crawled up on
the bed over Shizuru and brought her face to hover just over
Shizuru’s. “And you’re so sexy when you blush. I think I know
why you always try to do this to me, you naughty girl.” Shizuru
wouldn’t have thought it was possible, but her blush deepened even
further as Natsuki deduced her secret. To hide it, she surprised
Natsuki by bringing her hands back to the girl’s back and pulling
her down, both satisfying the need she felt in her body that had gone
without the girl’s touch for too long now and allowing her to lock
Natsuki’s lips in her own.</p><p>Natsuki was stunned for
a moment, allowing Shizuru to take full advantage of their kiss and
the feeling of Natsuki’s body pressed against her own. Just as she
let out a moan of pleasure from the feelings, Natsuki regained enough
control to push back away, turning Shizuru’s expressing into a
pout. “A <i>really</i> naughty girl,” Natsuki said seductively.
“I thought you were supposed to let me do everything tonight. Well,
I guess maybe I have been a bit remiss in leaving you unsatisfied, so
maybe I can let it pass this one time.” Natsuki gave a quick smile
and dropped her face back down to give Shizuru’s mouth a quick peck
before moving back down her body.</p><p>Natsuki wasted no time
in getting back to work, with her mouth enveloping and starting to
devour Shizuru’s left breast while one hand played with her right
and the other had dropped down to gently rub the sensitive spot on
Shizuru’s side where here HiME mark had been. Under this triple
assault, it didn’t take long for Shizuru to return to her previous
state of arousal. She felt her eyes closing and sight slipping from
her again as her mind was focused on the jolts of pleasure Natsuki’s
ministrations were sending through her body.</p><p>Eventually, Natsuki
seemed to be satisfied with Shizuru’s arousal, and she brought her
mouth back up off of Shizuru’s breast and to her mouth. After a
light kiss, she lifted off and paused her hands for a moment. When
Shizuru opened her eyes to see what was going on, she found Natsuki
staring back at her, her eyes trying to take in all of Shizuru’s
face at once.</p><p>As Natsuki noticed
Shizuru’s eyes opening, her right hand drifted from Shizuru’s
side across her stomach, finally coming to rest right below her belly
button. Shizuru let out a light gasp as she knew what Natsuki was
intending to do next and tried to brace herself for feeling her
love’s touch in her most intimate regions. A knowing smile formed
on Natsuki’s face as her eyes stared deep into Shizuru’s,
seemingly peering into the depths of Shizuru’s soul and making her
feel even more naked before her lover.</p><p>Slowly, Natsuki’s
hands started to move downwards. Her eyes remained locked with
Shizuru’s the whole time, taking in every reaction on the girl’s
face. A shiver ran through Shizuru as Natsuki’s hand passed over
her neatly-trimmed pubic hair and stopped just before meeting more
tender flesh. After what seemed like an eternity, Natsuki’s hand
slipped down to encompass the entirety of Shizuru’s womanhood,
eliciting a deep moan from Shizuru.</p><p>After a moment to allow
Shizuru to get used to her touch, one of Natsuki’s fingers slowly
curled around, splitting apart Shizuru’s outer lips and starting to
explore her depths. Shizuru let out a harsh gasp at this intrusion,
and she felt her hands desperately try to clamp onto Natsuki to hold
herself steady. She sensed the girl getting uncomfortable from being
squeezed in her arms though, so she used what remained of her
conscious mind to force her right hand out from around Natsuki. It
found Natsuki’s left hand, which was still resting on her breast,
and clasped it in a desperate grip as Natsuki’s roaming finger
tried to drive her crazy.</p><p>Natsuki chuckled
slightly at the consideration Shizuru was showing her even under such
duress. She bent in to give her lover a sweet kiss in thanks. As the
kiss deepened, Natsuki’s finger found a particularly sensitive nub
and caused Shizuru to gasp into her mouth. Natsuki took full
advantage of the opening and slipped her tongue into Shizuru’s
mouth, claiming it all for her own and driving Shizuru into a haze of
desire.</p><p>Shizuru writhed beneath
Natsuki from the mixed sensations of Natsuki’s passionate kiss and
her finger slowly caressing Shizuru’s clit. Pleasure seemed to be
shooting in bolts through her body, every inch of her skin tingling
from the sensations. On lonely nights, she’d tried to pleasure
herself alone, but she’d never felt even a fraction of what she was
feeling now from Natsuki’s touch. She could feel all that remained
of her emotional barriers breaking before Natsuki, and tears once
more started to leak from her eyes.</p><p>Natsuki seemed to sense
the surge of emotions in her, and she came up from the kiss and
slowed the stroking of her finger. Torn from the girl, Shizuru
attempted to call out Natsuki’s name, but all she was capable of
was a slur of vowels. She couldn’t take the separation for long,
and her left hand was quick to come up to the back of Natsuki’s
head and pull her back down to her lips, reassuring the girl that
nothing was wrong.</p><p>With a chuckle into
Shizuru’s mouth, Natsuki resumed her caresses. A second finger was
soon to join the first, and they started to stroke the length of
Shizuru’s slit. Shizuru couldn’t help but to start bucking her
hips into Natsuki’s hand to speed up the torturously slow movements
of her fingers. Natsuki let her do this for a bit, matching her
rhythm, but she surprised Shizuru when she suddenly reached her
fingers up to give Shizuru’s clit a sharp pinch, evoking from
Shizuru a sharp gasp and a jerk of her pelvis at the surge of
pleasure it induced.</p><p>Backing off from
Shizuru’s face to allow her more room to breathe, Natsuki upped the
ante once more. As one of her fingers remained on her clit, the other
slowly dipped below and pushed its way past Shizuru’s inner lips
and into her depths. Shizuru’s inner walls instinctively clamped in
on it, and waves of pleasure shot through her body at the feeling of
Natsuki inside of her. Natsuki didn’t even have to move to cause
Shizuru to rise to greater heights of pleasure, as the simple
presence of her finger was enough to drive Shizuru into a lust-filled
haze.</p><p>As soon as Shizuru’s
walls started to relax and get used to Natsuki’s finger, it began
moving inside of her, while at the same time her other finger resumed
its caresses of her clit. The pace was slow, almost teasing, but it
was driving Shizuru wild. She let out a stream of whimpers from the
constant bolts of pleasure that were assailing her, unable to hold
them back even if she’d wanted to.</p><p>Natsuki seemed to
notice this as well, and she delighted in it. She started varying her
pace, playing around with getting Shizuru to moan at different rates.
Shizuru barely had the presence of mind to realize how Natsuki was
teasing her, but she didn’t have the energy to do or say anything
about it. The only effect this realization had on her was causing a
blush to form once more across her face, and this only served to spur
Natsuki on even more.</p><p>“I think I like you
like this,” Natsuki said teasingly as she continued the erratic
movements of her fingers, prompting Shizuru to expend what little of
her available mental resources she could to focus on the girl’s
face. Only a hint of a devious smile was present there; most of her
expression was taken up by adoration for Shizuru. “Completely bare…
completely at my mercy… blushing beautifully.” Shizuru’s blush
deepened at this, as if she subconsciously wanted to please Natsuki
more with it.</p><p>“I wonder,” Natsuki
said, a mischievous sparkle appearing in her eyes, “What expression
could I see on that gorgeous face of yours if I do <i>this</i>!”
Suddenly, Natsuki’s second finger joined the first and they
simultaneously plunged as far into Shizuru’s depths as they could
fit. A sharp gasp came from Shizuru, quickly fading into a moan as
her face contorted in ecstasy. She vaguely heard a chuckle come from
Natsuki. “I think I like that expression on you…”</p><p>Natsuki’s fingers
started moving inside her again, striking a steady pace this time.
Silently grateful for finally being able to help out and match her
pace, Shizuru started bucking her hips in time with Natsuki’s
thrusts. Every nerve in her body felt alive, and she knew she was
getting close to release. She was torn between a desire to let this
moment of intimacy last forever and a need for fulfillment, but she
didn’t have any control in the matter.</p><p>Shizuru’s body
started trembling wildly, and she could feel her inner walls
constricting and becoming even more alive at Natsuki’s touch. Her
moans became even louder and more rapid. She desperately wanted to
scream Natsuki’s name, but she no longer had enough control to do
so.</p><p>Natsuki was well aware
of the rising passion in Shizuru, and she tried to slow down her pace
to drag out the moment. Shizuru’s release was inevitable at this
point though, and Natsuki was only helping to force her higher in
passion before she’d be able to release it all. But this didn’t
seem to be Natsuki’s goal, as she leaned her head in towards
Shizuru’s ear and starting speaking, the words piercing through the
haze of Shizuru’s mind.</p><p>“You have no idea how
hard it was for me to hold back until this moment Shizuru, but I
wanted it to be just right. I wanted to create the absolute perfect
moment for you.” Shizuru was so far gone she couldn’t even think
of what Natsuki might have meant; she just absorbed the words and
listened as her body wracked with passion from Natsuki’s continuing
thrusts, getting closer and closer to her peak.</p><p>A spot of wetness met
Shizuru’s ear, likely dripped from Natsuki’s face. Natsuki had
let her own passions leak out at this moment, and they laced the
words she spoke next. “I love you, Shizuru,” she said, her voice
breaking. “I love you so much.” At these last words, Natsuki’s
fingers curled up into Shizuru’s depths and met a particularly
sensitive spot within her, rubbing it rapidly, almost painfully. At
the same time, the palm of her hand came in and pressed in on
Shizuru’s clit, her grip squeezing release out of Shizuru.</p><p>Shizuru’s world
exploded around her. Every nerve in her body was filled to the brim
with pleasure, and her mind was focused on a single thought:
Natsuki’s words to her. Her body thrashed underneath Natsuki,
convulsions sweeping through her muscles. Her right hand squeezed in
on Natsuki’s, almost threatening to break it, while her left pulled
the girl’s head down into her.</p><p>Somehow, Natsuki had
managed to bring her mouth over to Shizuru’s lips despite the
pressure Shizuru’s hand was applying on it. As a small amount of
cognizance returned to Shizuru, she found herself and Natsuki locked
in a desperate kiss, and she could feel Natsuki’s fingers slowly
stroking her, trying to prolong the moment of pleasure as long as
possible.</p><p>Aftershocks of pleasure
shot through Shizuru as Natsuki slowly brought her down from her
peak. The stroking of her lover’s fingers slowed and eventually
came to a rest inside her, and all Shizuru could think about was the
girl that had brought her this pleasure. Emotion started to pour out
of her as awareness returned to her, and sobs began to wrack her body
as tears poured relentlessly from her eyes.</p><p>Natsuki saw the change
in her, and before Shizuru knew it she found herself being cradled in
Natsuki’s arms. Natsuki’s right hand was slowly stroking her
back, and Natsuki whispered soothing and sweet words into her ear.
“It’s alright, Shizuru, I’m right here. I’m not going to
leave you. I love you. I’m more sure of this than I’ve ever been
of anything in my life. I love you, Shizuru. I love you.”</p><p>When Shizuru’s sobs
came to a halt, Natsuki reluctantly pulled herself away from the
girl. She didn’t go far, though. She’d just sat up so she could
tug the bed sheets out from under them and bring them back up to
cover the pair. The enveloping warmth of the sheets was accompanied
by Natsuki resuming her embrace of Shizuru, and she started gently
rubbing her back again. With a contented moan, Shizuru nuzzled her
face into the crook of Natsuki’s neck.</p><p>She wished she had the
energy to repay Natsuki at this point, but Shizuru was just too
spent. Natsuki probably wouldn’t have let her in any case; she
would have just insisted that this night was supposed to be all about
making Shizuru happy. That was alright; she’d have time to prepare
this way, and when she was at her peak energy she could do a much
better job at making Natsuki’s first time as special as hers was.
But until then, there was one nagging thought that still had to be
satisfied; one thing she could still do for Natsuki.</p><p>“I love you too,
Natsuki,” Shizuru said sleepily, and she felt her love’s arms
squeeze her sweetly in response. She imagined a precious little smile
forming on Natsuki’s face at this, and maybe even a cute blush. She
kept the image of Natsuki’s angelic face at the front of her mind
as she drifted off to sleep, knowing that she’d surely be seeing
her love in her dreams before long.</p>
