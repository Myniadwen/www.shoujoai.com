<a href="../maihime/letter4u-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>From the Personal Journal of SUZUSHIRO HARUKA

Another day, another omiai. This one will probably fail too. Perhaps 
mother is right; I&#39;m just too headstrong for a woman. Men see my 
take-charge attitude and run the other way. I just can&#39;t be any other 
way. If I am to lead the Suzushiro Group one day, I need to be as 
strong as possible to defeat our many rivals. 

I hate this stupid kimono! The color&#39;s wrong and it&#39;s stifling in 
this heat. (I must remember to send grandmother a thank-you note).

But what&#39;s wrong with me lately? This wasn&#39;t a part of the plan. 
By this time I was supposed to be happily married with child on the 
way. Another heir to the Suzushiro fortune. 

As many times as I write it, that life just doesn&#39;t seem like mine.
There should be more to this.

I watched mother and swore to myself I&#39;d never have her life. Married 
for convenience to a man she barely knew. She&#39;s always said that she 
learned to love father. I can tell they love each other in a way. But 
there&#39;s no passion, no romance. They&#39;re just comfortable with each 
other. 

Listen to me going on about passion and romance like some giddy 
schoolgirl! 

That girl has long, since grown up. Days of sending love letters 
to a certain classmate only to have them returned un-opened are over.
Maybe...if she&#39;d have just told me to my face that my feelings were 
unwanted, that she didn&#39;t feel the same about me, I could have let it 
go. But this was worse than a refusal. I was ignored.

I can endure many things but Suzushiro Haruka, future leader of the 
Suzushiro Group WILL NOT BE IGNORED!

I realize now that it was a silly thing to base my high school career 
on. But I&#39;d made up my mind. It took me three years of hating Fujino 
to finally realize what my real problem was. I idolized her without 
knowing her heart. I loved an image rather than a real person.

I thought she pitied me, a common girl born into a prestigious family. 
My life was filled with tutors and training, etiquette, posture, 
literature, flower arrangement, dance. All things that seemed to come 
naturally to Fujino. 

It all came to a head when I saw her together with that Kuga Natsuki.
How dare she throw away everything for this love? How dare the star of 
Fuuka Gakuen, so easily slip out of her appointed role? While awkward, 
pushy Suzushiro Haruka had to struggle every day to keep up 
appearances. 

Every day I kept up the appearance of a proper young lady. Slavishly 
adhering to school traditions, ignoring my wants, my dreams.

Ignoring my real feelings, ignoring those surreptitious glances my 
kouhai gives me. Pretending I don&#39;t hear the tenderness in her voice 
when she says my name. Disregarding the hurt look she gets when I send 
her on another assignment when I could have gone with her. How she always 
knows to rub my shoulders when I&#39;m tense or how I like my tea, and a 
million other things. Ignoring the way my heart skips a beat every 
time she enters a room. 

It was just too cruel that Fujino Shizuru, who had so much going for 
her could come clean with her feelings while I had to play the part of 
the good girl. 

Yukino, I never let on that I knew. I wasn&#39;t brave enough to tell you 
the truth. Now Fujino Shizuru is happy with her abnormal little family. 
And I&#39;m destined to marry a man I don&#39;t even love. 

I can&#39;t believe I lost to her again.</pre>
