<pre>Dearest Natsuki,

I pray that this letter finds you well. The leaves are changing here. 
The garden is bathed in amber, ocher and gold. The morning view from 
the bedroom is magnificent. Though the bed feels so empty without you 
here.

Forgive me; I&#39;ve been a bit lonely of late. Though I really have no 
reason to be. Shizuka and Natsuko keep me so busy I hardly have time to 
mope. The little imps are probably into something else as I write. 

But I am blessed to have them. They remind me so much of you, always 
testing their boundaries. Just yesterday I turned my back for two 
minutes (I swear) for a phone call and I found them in the kitchen of 
all places, elbow-deep in a jar of mayonnaise. I can only hope 
their eating habits aren&#39;t the only thing they inherited from you.

I shouldn&#39;t be this way. We agreed that your work tracing the First 
District and the Searrs Foundation was improtant, but I can&#39;t help 
longing for you. I&#39;d resined myself to the fact that I&#39;d be 
married one day. But to marry the one I loved, and to bear and raise 
two beautiful daughters witht that same love was beyond my wildest 
dreams.

Please allow me this one moment of selfishness. Find your answers and 
come home soon.

With love always,

Shizuru</pre>
