<h1>Too Late (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leebot.html">Leebot</a><br> </h2>
<p>Secrets</p><hr>I met Natsuki in my
third year of college. I was tutoring other students for a little
extra cash on the side, and she approached me near the end of the
fall term. She’d had to miss a couple weeks of classes due to a
bout with pneumonia, and she needed my help to catch up. I was
something of a polyglot myself, so fortunately I was able to help her
with all of her classes. I did have to forgo tutoring anyone else,
but she paid me more than enough to make up for it.</p><p>However, after the
first couple sessions with her, I would have willingly continued to
help her for free. Natsuki was absolutely the most adorable creature
I’d ever come across. It wasn’t just in her physical appearance –
though she certainly was quite pretty – her whole attitude just
screamed, “Cute!” to me. Watching her break out in giddiness as
she figured out some concept was just priceless. It was like she was
my own little puppy, craving my approval and wagging her tail
frantically when she got it. I don’t know what exactly she liked in
me, but we became fast friends and got together regularly even after
she no longer needed my help.</p><p>I was absolutely
enchanted with her, which made it all the more of a shock when I
learned that she had a boyfriend. Of course, the fact that she was
involved put her off-limits to me, but the fact that it was with a
boy also decreased the chance that she’d also be into girls –
just in case it ever fell through, I justified to myself. But their
relationship showed no such signs of any problems. I learned through
talking with her that they’d been exclusive for over a year, and
they were obviously quite comfortable together.</p><p>Inside, I was torn up
by this news. Try as I might, I just couldn’t stop myself from
feeling for her, though. Fortunately, I was somehow able to hide this
side of my feelings from her. Even when I slipped a little and went a
bit further than was appropriate between friends, she never seemed to
notice that anything was wrong. I learned eventually that I was
actually the first female friend she’d ever had, so I guess she
probably just had nothing to compare our friendship to.</p><p>In the end, I resolved
myself to accept whatever of Natsuki I could get. I might never be
able to have all of her, but the small glimpses of heaven I got were
enough to keep me going. I never was able to get rid of my feelings
for her, though. I wish I had; it would have made things a lot easier
now and prevented a lot of pain.</p><p>At times, I hated
myself for feeling the way I did. I met her boyfriend a couple of
times, and he was really a great guy. He certainly loved Natsuki very
much, and she returned it. I mused at times that he actually seemed
like a male version of myself, and this made it impossible to really
hate him. I resented him, certainly, for having gotten to Natsuki
first, but that was just my problem, not his. I liked to imagine,
though, that Natsuki would truly be better off with me, but I
couldn’t know for sure.</p><p>Things continued more
or less stably for a while, until one day Natsuki told me something
which caused my whole world to shatter. Her boyfriend had proposed to
her, and she accepted. All the threads of hope I’d clung onto for
so long were cut away from me. Natsuki was claimed as his, and they
were soon to cement the union in law – a way I’d never be able to
with her, even if we did somehow get together.</p><p>I held up a mask of
happiness for her as she told me the news. I acted as if I were glad
for her, while inside my heart was being torn in two. I excused
myself from her presence as soon as I could, though, so I could go
home to cry my heart out.</p><p>It was pathetic, but it
was all I could do. I hated myself for feeling this way. I was
supposed to be her friend, and as her friend, I should have simply
been happy for her. Maybe how I felt for her made me a bad friend
then, but I couldn’t help it. I’d tried to stop, I wish I could
have stopped, but I failed, and it ended up killing me.</p><p>I cried for hours,
desperately clutching at my bedsheets, pretending that it was Natsuki
there for me. I wasn’t one to normally be so emotional, so I really
had no good way to handle it. I pictured desperately a world where
Natsuki and I could be together, hoping I could descend into that
fantasy. As I got more desperate, I would have settled for simply
going a bit insane then just so I could believe that fantasy was real
and be free of my pain.</p><p>It was no good. Nothing
I could do would help in the slightest. Life was quite simply being
unfair to me. I’d met the girl of my dreams just to learn that she
was already taken. I’d never even had a chance to win her heart. It
was as if some spiteful god just wished to rub in my face what I’d
never be getting. Then, just as I was able to settle into something
of a routine with things, she got engaged, proving to me just how
cursed I truly was.</p><p>I wanted to tell her.
My heart screamed at me to open up to her and let her know how I was
feeling. But there was just no way I could. The part of me which
still cared about being a good friend overruled my heart. I just
couldn’t go and let her know how much I was hurting on what should
have been one of the happiest days of her life. For the sake of
Natsuki, I had to keep all of this to myself and suffer in silence.</p><p>It became harder 
as the
day went on, though. The pain in my heart just kept growing until the
chivalrous part of me couldn’t hold back against it. It just wasn’t
fair that I had to hurt this much. I needed to talk to Natsuki. What
if this was actually right? I wondered. Could I ever truly forgive
myself if I let this pass in silence? I needed to know. I knew I
would almost certainly be rejected and ruin our friendship as a
result of it, but the slim chance of winning Natsuki was worth it.
Our friendship was likely forfeit anyways.</p><p>The only thing that
held me back was the fear of hurting her. I still cared for her that
much, at least. I didn’t want to put her through the pain of having
to decide and reject either me or her boyfriend. But I still couldn’t
just stay here, crying alone. Eventually, I came to a compromise with
myself. I’d talk to her, ask for her support, but I wouldn’t tell
her specifically what was bothering me. It would still hurt her a
little to know I was in pain, I was sure, but that was the standard
toil of friendship.</p><p>Having come to this
decision, I lay on my back on my bed and tried to steady myself, to
stop my tears so I could be somewhat intelligible to her. I reached
over my hand and fumbled for my phone on the nightstand. With a final
deep breath, I flipped it open and hit the speed-dial for Natsuki.</p><p>I held my breath as 
the
phone started ringing. After two rings, I started picturing in my
mind what Natsuki might have been up to. Perhaps she was celebrating
with her new fiancé. Maybe they were even… I shook my head
rapidly to prevent that thought from fully forming. I couldn’t take
that prospect right now.</p><p>“Hello?” Natsuki
answered her phone. I struggled to get a grip on myself and figure
out what I was going to say.</p><p>“Natsuki?” Of
course it was her; it was her cell phone after all. But I just
couldn’t think of anything better to say.</p><p>“Shizuru!” She
said. Her voice seemed to have filled with cheer as she said this.
“What’s up?” I pictured Natsuki once more as my little puppy,
wagging her tail as she was happy to see me.</p><p><i>My little puppy…
My puppy… My Natsuki. Mine.</i></p><p>“I love you.”</p>
