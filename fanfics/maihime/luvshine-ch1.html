    <p>Twilight glistened on top of the   new fallen snow like thousands of tiny diamonds waiting to be plucked   from their pillows of white. The soft <em>shrr shrr</em> of ice skates   broke the wintry stillness of <em>Yoyogi-koen</em>. It was almost deserted   except for a few random skaters who took advantage of the city-wide   curfew due to a surprisingly strong winter storm the previous day to   have the lake to themselves. <br />
 <br />
Though winter storms weren't uncommon in Tokyo in February, this particular   one dumped more snow than usual on the city, much to the delight of   children and not a few adults. Mai wasn't fond of the cold nor of snow   by any means; thus, she was quite content to view the white loveliness   from high above the city in the small flat she shared with her former   schoolmate.  <br />
 <br />
“<em>Ne</em>, Natsuki?” <br />
 <br />
“<em>Ne</em>, Mai?” Natsuki intoned from across the room, as if on   cue. Pencils stuck out randomly from her hair as apparently she would   stick one in, forget that it was there and reach for another. Motorcycle   parts were strewn about the low table in front of her as she pored over   schematics for the Yamaha RZ250 in preparation for the practical portion   of her fuel systems class. She was chewing on the end of a newly acquired   pencil when Mai called out to her again. <br />
 <br />
“Will you be working all evening?”  <br />
 <br />
Natsuki shot Mai a dark look over the rim of her eyeglasses. “Whyyy?”   she drawled. <br />
 <br />
The red-head ignored the look and continued to stare out into the gathering   gloom. “No particular reason,” she shrugged. “I just thought you   might want to go out to eat for a change.” <br />
 <br />
If it had been anyone else, Natsuki would have jumped at the chance   to have someone wait on her in a nice restaurant. But this was Mai,   a woman whose culinary skills were known all over Fuuka Gakuen as rivaling   even the best chefs on campus. <em>Perhaps she was running a fever…</em> <br />
 <br />
“Are you ok?” Natsuki asked with a mild frown. She put down her   pencil and moved to opposite her roommate by the window. When Mai didn’t   respond, she leaned her forehead against Mai’s to see if her temperature   was up. The other girl flushed pink at the contact. When they were back   at Fuuka, she hadn’t really tried to hide the fact that she had a   serious crush on the wayward biker girl. Unfortunately, Natsuki’s   status as the campus heartthrob meant keeping the walls around her firmly   intact. The only person who was successful in breaching them was Fujino   Shizuru, an idol in her own right. After a while, it started to look   like she had no hope of vying for Natsuki’s affection so she decided   to play the role of supportive friend instead. Once Shizuru graduated,   however, she noticed that the couple gradually drifted apart, each finding   their own way in life while remaining close friends. When the object   of her unrequited crush approached her about sharing a place in downtown   Tokyo, Mai practically jumped at the opportunity. All of which led them   to the here and now, their first Valentine’s Day together, though   unattached. Another perfect opportunity to let Natsuki know her heart,   but what could she do? <br />
 <br />
“Oh for heaven’s sake…what’s going on with you?” <br />
 <br />
Mai stiffened and turned away to hide her deepening blush. “It’s   nothing. Honest! I just…” she trailed off. <br />
 <br />
Natsuki stared at her for a few moments, then grunted as if she’d   made a decision about something. She grabbed Mai’s hand, gathered   up both of their coats and made for the door. <br />
 <br />
“Natsuki! Where are you taking me?” <br />
 <br />
“Less talking, more moving of the feet.” Mai sighed in consternation,   knowing it was best to just go along with her. She was surprised when   they veered from the small shack where Natsuki garaged her bike and   headed toward the park instead. They slipped and slid in the fluffy   white powder, indulging in impromptu snowball skirmishes all the way   there. Some minutes later, they reached one of the winding trails that   led to one of the Yoyogi koen’s largest lakes. <br />
 <br />
Mai tugged Natsuki’s hand. It had not escaped her notice that her   friend had not let go since they left their flat. “<em>Now</em> will   you tell me where we’re going?” <br />
 <br />
The dark-haired woman paused briefly on the trail, her eyes glazed over   with nostalgia. “Did I ever tell you that this is where I received   my first real kiss?” She pointed to a spot some ways ahead of them.   “Right at the edge of the lake.” <br />
 <br />
Icy fingers of despair crept around Mai’s heart. It was one thing   to be a supportive friend, it was quite another to bear witness to a   crush’s fond memory of past love. “Natsuki, I...” she began as   a hard lump began to form in her throat, threatening to rob her of air. <br />
 <br />
“I doubt I'll ever tell anyone…yet, the words are coming out of   my mouth. How odd is that?” Natsuki continued as if she had never   heard. They were walking slower now and the ice covered lake soon came   into view. Mai gasped in surprise. It was unusual for Natsuki to take   anyone into her confidence; stranger still, she was telling her something   that she had told no one else. <br />
 <br />
“What brought that on?” she asked, half-joking. Part of her was   curious as to what else might be said, what other unspoken secrets she   would be privy to.  <br />
 <br />
Natsuki merely stood in silence and stared out across the mist-covered   ice. Everything around them glistened, even the sounds of the city without   shone, white and muted. She turned to Mai after a time; her green eyes   glowed almost grey in the dimness. <br />
 <br />
“There was a saying that I remember my mother going on about when   I was a child,” she recalled in hush tones.  <br />
 <br />
“What was that?” Mai inquired, her curiousity piqued. Across the   lake, a group of enterprising youngsters set off a round of red and   white fireworks that startled her but did not seem to catch Natsuki   off guard. Before she knew what was going on, Mai found herself being   drawn into strong, soft arms. As bursts of colour lit up the sky, she   could feel the warmth of Natsuki’s lips on her own.  <br />
 <br />
“<em>Never forget that love shines.</em>”</p>
