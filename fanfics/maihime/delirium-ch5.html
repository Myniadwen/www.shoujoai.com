<p>Manga Notes:<br />
  -So like, I think I already said that in the manga  when Natsuki meets up with her evil!HiME! mother for the first time,  she lost her powers. And Tate was there and Shizuru was also there.  Shizuru got shot and then was forgotten while um...Natsuki kisses Tate  saying something among the lines of: &quot;even if you don't accept my  feelings, I still care for you&quot; or something utterly stupid like that.  And because she was true to her feelings--Duran appeared as Duran Max  Heart! ~dies~ Which basically is like Duran with a stupid cloak...kinda  like the ones those knight horseys have. Hey that fits! Seeing how  Duran became a one-shot pony. <br />
</p>
<div align="right">&quot;Water, water, everywhere,<br />
  And all the boards did shrink.<br />
  Water, water everywhere,<br />
  Nor any drop to drink.&quot; <br />
  <br />
  ~<em>Samuel Taylor Coleridge</em></div>
<p><br />
  
  “You’re not busy today.” Yasuo stated. <br />
  <br />
  Shizuru  looked up from the paper she was reading. “That would be correct,” she  said evenly, “but you know that, Yasuo-senpai, seeing how you serve as  my aide.” <br />
  <br />
  This caused the other to laugh from where he sat.  “I’m more like freeloader. I’m still getting paid by your father, only  now all I have to do is watch you do my job better than I did it.” <br />
  <br />
  “That is not true.” <br />
  <br />
  Her  modest comment caused Yasuo to roll his eyes. “Please. At least they  remember your face. Then again, it isn’t hard to.” He said  flirtatiously, winking at her. <br />
  <br />
  “I thought we have gone over this before, senpai.” <br />
  <br />
  “Thousands  of times, Madame Soon-to-be-President, and you know full well that I  say it with the humor of a caring older brother.&quot; <br />
  <br />
  “Ara? Then I must thank you, <em>oniisan.</em>” <br />
  <br />
  “You  are very welcome.” The brown haired man stood up and moved towards the  desk where Shizuru sat. “Besides, it positively warms my heart knowing  that I’m training the future successor of the Fujino dynasty.” <br />
  <br />
  He picked up a small paperweight from the desk and began to lightly toss it as he carefully chose his next words. <br />
  <br />
  “I’ve  never questioned your decisions or actions before, Shizuru-chan.  Neither has your father. Both of us are pleased that you’ve come back  to where you rightfully belong. We accept you with no strings  attached.” He paused for a moment to turn and give her an affable  smile. <br />
  <br />
  “But you are working too hard. Don’t think I haven’t  noticed how you make sure you have no free time. That isn’t like the  girl I used to know at all. And so, I have taken it upon myself to  remedy this terrible affliction that has befallen my cute  Shizuru-chan.” <br />
  <br />
  The burgundy eyed woman raised an inquisitive eyebrow, “And that would be…” <br />
  <br />
  “I  met one of your old fangirls yesterday. Seeing how you have worked so  efficiently like I expected, I’ve arranged a meeting between you two.  Hopefully—ah, there she is.” He said when he heard a hesitant knock on  the door. “Excuse me for a moment.” <br />
  <br />
  He moved toward the door and opened it. “Come in.”<br />
  <br />
  “Excuse the interruption.” Natsuki said politely as she walked into the office. <br />
  <br />
  *~*~*~<br />
  <br />
  She  wasn’t sure what she was expecting when she walked in, but Natsuki was  sure that it wasn’t the look of shock on Shizuru’s face. The other  woman’s face visibly paled—even she could see it from where she was  standing, feet away from the other’s desk. Shizuru’s eyes widened in  surprise and then quickly became unreadable, shielded by years of  training.<br />
  <br />
  There she was, the woman that had consumed her  thoughts for weeks. There she stood as stiff as a dead body. She looked  the same: it wasn’t like she could physically change in a few weeks.  Her hair was twisted into a simple knot over her head, stylish and  practical, and she was dressed in a business suit. Oddly enough, it was  the same as the one she had wore on television. It was obvious that  Shizuru wasn’t expecting her; the only thing the woman could do was to  stare at her.<br />
  <br />
  All Natsuki could do was stare back, her words  frozen in her mouth. She had been thinking about what to say since she  accidentally put herself in this situation. Yet, now, she couldn’t  remember anything she had practiced or thought of saying.<br />
  <br />
  Here she stood in silence. There <em>she</em> sat in silence.<br />
  <br />
  And  then, Shizuru’s eyes narrowed, eyes darkening into a bloody red. She  turned to look at a confused Yasuo. A single word fell harshly into the  air, uttered in deadly solemnity: <br />
  <br />
  “Leave.”<br />
  <br />
  He quickly  hid his confusion, unsure what exactly was transpiring, and left the  room. The door barely made a sound as it closed. <br />
  <br />
  Natsuki felt  just as confused. She had never seen the other like this before. She  summoned back her strength, her resolve to get this conversation over  with. Her objective was unclear; she still wasn’t sure why she came.  No, there wasn't anything else she could do. <br />
  <br />
  “Shizuru...” <br />
  <br />
  Shizuru’s  eyes narrowed dangerously even more and a frown was evident on her  face. “You shouldn’t be here, Natsuki.” She said, no…she stated. <br />
  <br />
  “I wanted to see you.” <br />
  <br />
  She  watched as Shizuru posture became even more rigid as if she was  containing all her emotions in, straining to keep them in control. The  silence was nearly tangible, palpable. The ticking of the clock behind  her seem to boom in her ears along with the beating of her heart. <br />
  <br />
  “Why are you here?” Shizuru asked coldly. <br />
  <br />
  “Am  I not allowed to see you?” Even though she was a person that was never  nervous, Natsuki was beginning to feel so. This atmosphere, something  about if felt wrong. It was a convoluting mist of hostility. <br />
  <br />
  The  golden browned haired woman abruptly stood up. Pens and papers fell  forgotten on the floor. “Why are you here?” She repeated. Even though  her voice was strained, Natsuki couldn’t detect the emotion in those  words. She could only feel how tense, how tight those words were  uttered from the usually relaxed woman. <br />
  <br />
  “Shizuru?”<br />
  <br />
  Natsuki  realized that wasn’t the best reply as Shizuru’s palms landed on her  desk, resounding as hands met wood. And then there was anger.<br />
  <br />
  “Do  you think this is amusing to you, Kuga-san, coming here?” She said, her  voice dangerously soft—a knife upon the velvet, accentuated by a thick  accent. <br />
  <br />
  Natsuki instinctively bristled. “What’s wrong with you?” she asked, becoming irritated. <br />
  <br />
  “You’re asking what is wrong with <em>me</em>?” Shizuru spat out angrily. “When here you are, in front of me as if you had the right—<br />
  <br />
  “You mean I have to have a right to come before you?” Natsuki interrupted. “Who do—<br />
  <br />
  “Natsuki,  you don’t have the right to come barging into my life. You think I’m  just going to placidly come back to you so you can just continue on  with your life as if nothing happened? That you didn’t, for years, just  throw me to a side? Do you think I haven’t tried to stay with you,  doing everything I could to make you happy? <br />
  <br />
  “I’ve—<br />
  <br />
  “<em>I’ve </em> tried, tried everything. It hurt me to leave you, but it hurts even  more to stay with you as you continued to act as if we’re still in high  school.” She said bitterly. “Every single day I though that it would be  different, maybe once she will actually see me. Maybe one day she will  accept my love for what it is.” <br />
  <br />
  Shizuru’s head snapped back  up, staring at her with righteous anger burning in her wine colored  eyes. “No! All you did was turn away, always staring at  something—someone else. You would always be too busy chasing your  dreams to look back to where I waited for you! I was never good enough  for you!”<br />
  <br />
  “That’s no true. I—<br />
  <br />
  “I realize it now. I  should’ve known back in high school that this would happen. I should’ve  of known ever since that day when your mother came back that it would  always happen. I would give my life for you just so that you can go on  living your little fantasy! And yet—do you know how it felt to see you  kissing him while I lay bleeding on the floor? You might as well kill  me, Natsuki!” <br />
  <br />
  Shizuru had brought herself into a frenzied  state. She was screaming now, furious tears lay unshed in her eyes.  Natsuki had never seen her so angry. <br />
  <br />
  And Shizuru wasn’t finished with her spiel. <br />
  <br />
  “Do  you know how hard I worked trying to help, protect you? Who do you  think was supporting you all those years, making sure you didn’t kill  yourself or get thrown in jail? And what do I get? I thought I finally  had you…but I was wrong. Every single time you kiss me, you destroy me.  I’m…I’m not the one you think of. I’m…not the one.”<br />
  <br />
  Shizuru  seemed to finally regained control of herself. Her voice had softened  and her words were only despondent. Pain and longing were still evident  in her eyes, but even more dominant was the emotion of sad resignation. <br />
  <br />
  If time suddenly stopped, intransigent in a vibrant,  picturesque standstill, there she would be standing with her perfect  posture, surrounded in an aura of melancholy, despondency. There her  eyes, cast down, would burn in a forever looping time with only the  expression of a passion lost, harbored in vain. Wounds were open, raw,  flowing from those eyes that seemed to bleed everything she had slowly  accumulated through years. There she would stand, a proud grieving  woman. Yet time continued on.<br />
  <br />
  “It no longer matters. I finally wash my hands of you...Natsuki.” She whispered softly. <br />
  <br />
  She  had no idea what to say or do. Emerald greens were soft, inquisitive,  trying to understand…but she felt short, not quite understanding what  just transpired. She too stood there, only her posture seemed to be  caught in mid-run: knees bent, hands open; like she was trying to catch  up with something. She straightened slowly, her eyes never left the  other woman’s despite Shizuru’s efforts to not look at her. <br />
  <br />
  “Shizuru…”  She too whispered, hesitantly. She heard her own voice crack slightly  but there were no tears in her eyes. She couldn’t bring them. <br />
  <br />
  “Please  leave me, Natsuki.” The other woman begged her, her eyes finally  meeting hers. Natsuki couldn’t take the scrutiny and she looked down. <br />
  <br />
  “I…”<br />
  <br />
  “Don’t say anything. Just leave.” <br />
  <br />
  Silence  took reign again as she closed her eyes. It was here that the moment  had passed by. It was here where her chance to regain everything she  had lost laid. It was here that her second chance stood. But she had  not taken it—her. She had been blown off course by the very person she  sought. It didn’t matter now, everything didn’t matter. There was  nothing she could do. Not at this moment. <br />
  <br />
  “Alright.” There was  a bit of sadness in her voice, but there was also a sense of  detachment. Like she wasn’t really there; she was watching the scene  transpire from the view of an onlooker. She could not bring herself to  feel. <br />
  <br />
  So she turned around and opened the door, bypassing  Yasuo who stood protectively like an eerie gargoyle in his gray  business suit. She knew by instinct she would not be followed. When  reaching the floor’s elevator, her gaze was cast down. Natsuki wasn’t  thinking. <br />
  <br />
  When the elevator doors shut with finality and began  its descent, only then did Yasuo look back into the office. There  Shizuru stood, facing the outside, a single hand pressed on the glass  wall. From the angle he stood, he could not determine her features.  Slowly, his eyes closed in his own resignation before he quietly slid  out of the room and soundlessly shut the door behind him.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>OMAKE!<br />
  Otherwise Means Attack Kuga Energetically!<br />
  <br />
  (Because all good Sunrise acronyms deserve more. &gt;.&lt; ) <br />
  <br />
  When  Kuga Natsuki entered the room she did not expect to see Shizuru on the  floor sobbing her heart out. Yasuo gave her an odd glance before he ran  out of the room mumbling curses under his breath in heavy Kansai-ben. <br />
  <br />
  “Shizuru?” Natsuki asked cautiously, wondering what this was about.<br />
  <br />
  Suddenly!  Shizuru’s head whipped up, her eyes shot up to and through the heavens,  parting the sky, moon, stars, pies, cherry pies, disgusting broccoli  and cheese soup, the Red Sea…and Shizuru gasped! <br />
  <br />
  “Natsuki!” She cried out before she crawled towards the other on her knees, positively wrinkling her pretty business suit. <br />
  <br />
  If  Natsuki wasn’t the complete badass biker lady-girl person she was, she  would’ve fainted on the spot. Surely this wasn’t the same universe!  After all, didn’t she, weeks ago, see Shizuru leave her with the  expression of a kicked puppy on her face? What was happening? <br />
  <br />
  No idea. <br />
  <br />
  “Um…Shizuru?” She asked carefully not wanting to upset the other woman even further. <br />
  <br />
  Shizuru  started sniffling and crawled closer to where Natsuki stood before  latching onto the other woman’s legs and wailing. “What’s wrong with  me, Natsuki? Why can’t I do anything correctly?” <br />
  <br />
  “What the hell are you talking about?”<br />
  <br />
  Sniffle.  “I seem to drive everyone away. EVERYONE away. I’m sorry—sorry  NATSUKI!” She started to sob. “It’s all my fault. Do you think I’m too  forward? Am I too forward? Kami-sama, I <em>am</em> too forward, am I? I’m sorry Natsuki!”<br />
  <br />
  “Um…Shizuru? Are you drunk?”<br />
  <br />
  There  was a pause and Shizuru looked up with teary (but sober) eyes. “Do I  look like I’m drunk? Do I look like I’m DRUNK, NATSUKI?” She continued  sobbing. “No, I am plagued by the thousands heartaches that tear me  apart. I shall, in the bleak winter of my heart, wither and die. I know  now that I will die alone. ALONE without anyone around me! I will be in  my grave and no one will be at my funeral because I am a terrible  person.” <br />
  <br />
  “T-That’s not true. I’ll be at your funeral?”<br />
  <br />
  This  statement caused Shizuru to burst out into another wave of fresh tears.  “ALONE ALONE ALONE!!” She wailed like a professional wailer. “I will  become an old, angry business woman whose only pleasures are crushing  all oppositions and drinking gyokuro…warm, comforting gyokuro on a  relaxing summer…ALONE!” She cried again for good measure. <br />
  <br />
  “A-ah…Shizuru.  Getoff me. I can’t breathe.” Natsuki started to wave her arms around  trying to balance herself as the beautiful golden brown haired woman  leeched her way to her waist. <br />
  <br />
  “Oh, Natsuki, what am I going to  do? What did I do to you? I’m…so, so, so sorry. Kannin na, Natsuki I  will never ever everevereverever leave you again. I will never let go!”<br />
  <br />
  “Shi…zu…ru….let…me  go. I can’t…breathe.” Natsuki gasped as her waist was crushed under the  other’s surprisingly powerful grip. And then, when Shizuru shifted her  weight, Natsuki came crashing painfully onto the ground. It was around  the mere seconds of her descent that Natsuki noticed how the office was  in complete disarray. Papers were all over the floor, chairs  overturned, a window opened causing even more papers to boldly stream  through the air like a flag or perhaps a kite. Natsuki trembled;  panicked; hyperventilated. Oh what could she do? She had to wake up  somehow. <br />
  <br />
  “Natsuki?” Shizuru stopped for a moment, wondering what possessed Natsuki beat her pretty blue head onto the carpeted floor. <br />
  <br />
  “Need. To. Wake. Up. Now.” Natsuki grunted. <br />
  <br />
  Shizuru  stared at Natsuki for a moment before she resumed her previous action.  Only now one of her hands was snaked across Natsuki’s neck, holding  head in place. The other was wrapped around Natsuki’s torso while her  head rested on the crook of the blue haired woman’s neck. <br />
  <br />
  “See!  I’m such a terrible person that I would cause Natsuki to believe that  this world is a dream! That I would drive Natsuki to a point which she  wants to kill herself! Oh what a wretched person I am, harboring these  feelings! Woe is me! Upon me! …what was that Natsuki?”<br />
  <br />
  “I CAME HERE TO SAY I’M SORRY SHIZURU! NOW GET THE HELL OFF OF ME!”<br />
  <br />
  “Natsuki?” Shizuru looked up from her spiel. <br />
  <br />
  “I CAME TO SAY I WAS SORRY SHIZURU! I DIDN’T MEAN TO DO WHATEVER I DID TO YOU.”<br />
  <br />
  Shizuru paused before shifting upwards to look at the person she was once smothering. “Really?”<br />
  <br />
  “YES!”<br />
  <br />
  “Oh…alright then.” Shizuru promptly stood up and started to straighten her clothes.<br />
  <br />
  “…what?” <br />
  <br />
  “I said it was all right then, were you not listening?” Shizuru asked pleasantly with an unreadable smile on her face. <br />
  <br />
  “W-what just happened?”<br />
  <br />
  “Nothing.  I was just waiting for you to confess your grievances. I expect  something like what I have just performed in one week.” This was said  as Shizuru began to clean the room with frightening efficiency. <br />
  <br />
  “Wait…what?” <br />
  <br />
  “It  should be either formally typed and on my desk or acted out, preferably  on a Sunday. One o’clock would be perfect. Other than that, I believe I  am done with you for now, Kuga-san. I bid you farewell and I will see  you soon to discuss other arrangements.” Shizuru continued placidly as  she gently ushered the other out of her now spotless room. <br />
  <br />
Natsuki was speechless and remained speechless as she stared at the now closed door, wondering what exactly just transpired. </p>
