----------------------------------------------------------------------

On returning to their room, Mai was suddenly struck by how small it 
truly was. Suddenly shy, Mikoto had gone into the bathroom to change 
into her sleepwear while Mai changed in the outer room. Only a thin door 
separated them and soon not even that.

Mai was glad the younger girl was taking her time changing for she had 
some decisions to make. Laid out on the bed was an indecently sheer, 
midnight-blue chemise and embroidered lace panties. Next to them were 
Mai&#146;s standard yellow pajamas. 

Over the month since they&#39;d left the hospital, Mai had mulled over this 
night, how she would dress, should there be candle light? Should there 
be soft music playing? Rose petals on the sheets? 

Somehow all of those seemed wrong, false. Her love of Mikoto and the 
love the feral girl returned wasn&#39;t about the trappings of romance 
novels. Those expressions of love were shallow and self-serving. Mai 
swept the gaudy underthings back into her lingerie drawer and donned her 
pajamas. 

&quot;This is the Mai she loves,&quot; she said as she looked into her nightstand 
mirror and purposefully mussed her strawberry-blonde hair. &quot;The real me, 
not some tarted-up version of me.&quot;

As Mai turned down the bed her foresight was rewarded when Mikoto 
emerged from the bathroom in her customary nightshirt. Yet, as the feral 
girl climbed into bed, Mai could tell by the way the garment clung that 
she wore nothing underneath.

Both girls were now beneath the sheets gazing at each other. Mikoto 
regarded Mai with her golden eyes. Somehow, Mai seemed different 
tonight. The feral girl knew something like this was coming but she 
thought she&#39;d have more time to prepare. Her beloved friend now 
disheveled in her pajamas, hair mussed and full breasts peeking from 
within the thin garment. 

Of course she&#39;d craved Mai&#39;s love and affections, but the reality of 
realizing those affections physically was new to her. Something she&#39;d 
only indulged in her most private adolescent fantasies. That party and 
that world where everyone else existed were far away now. That era when 
they coexisted as mere friends was fast coming to an end. 

The promise of this new world frightened the younger girl as well as it 
enticed her. She&#39;d only known one other in what people called &quot;intimacy&quot; 
and it was an experience she hadn&#39;t wanted to repeat. But now, to have 
Mai, one she loved above all others, to have that Mai to herself-&quot;

Lips pressed Mikoto&#39;s lips. Her yelp of surprise turned into a murmur of 
pleasure as realized Mai was kissing her. At first she thought herself 
in a dream. Those soft lips could not be touching her own. The body 
slowly melting into that other soft body could not be hers. She&#39;d been 
thinking too much (something Mikoto couldn&#39;t recall ever doing before) 
and Mai had taken the initiative. 

This other Mikoto&#39;s mouth opened, inviting Mai&#39;s tongue to dance with 
hers. This other Mikoto felt Mai&#39;s hands travel up and down her spine 
leaving a tingling sensation in their wake. This other Mikoto plunged 
her hands into Mai&#39;s lovely hair, mussing it further and reveling in the 
silky texture of it. 

Unable to contain her jealousy the true Mikoto put aside her astral 
counterpart and reentered her body. Only to find a new Mai had replaced 
her beloved friend. The new Mai did not laugh or smile or cook tasty 
meals. The new Mai only hungered. And tonight she would feed on Mikoto.

Keenly aware of Mikoto&#39;s stiffening response, Mai slowed her assault 
upon her lips, instead making sweet love to them. Her tongue caressed 
Mikoto&#39;s mouth, lips savored Mikoto&#39;s lips. The younger girl relaxed, 
seeing that this wild animal was only another facet of Mai&#39;s 
personality. This facet both frightened and excited her.

Deciding to experiment, Mikoto urged Mai into a sitting position, her 
legs out before her. Mikoto straddled her hips and began kissing her 
mouth, cheeks and neck, searching for and locating the buttons of her 
top. 

Taken aback by the girl&#39;s audacity but not to be outdone, Mai reached 
behind Mikoto with the pretence of holding her close. Yet instead, she 
slid her hands down to caress the younger girl&#39;s tight posterior. She 
lifted the cotton nightshirt and explored the smooth, supple flesh, 
she&#39;d guiltily coveted mere hours before. 

Mikoto, having succeeded in opening Mai&#39;s top, buried her face in those 
handsome breasts taking in Mai&#39;s aroma. The scent, so familiar to Mikoto 
sensitive nose was now laden with pheromones which made the younger girl 
dizzy with desire. 

Mai barely stifled a cry when Mikoto&#39;s lips and tongue found her 
breasts. The feral girl was exploring, mapping that expanse with her 
mouth, delicately tasting of Mai&#39;s sensitive skin. She found the 
hardened nipple and took it into her mouth. 

Entranced, Mai stole a glance at her love as Mikoto sampled her. The 
younger girl gazed up at her, gold hued eyes glittering, as she held the 
captive nipple in her teeth and teased it with her tongue.

Somehow Mai stayed conscious as Mikoto released one nipple and 
concentrated on the other. While she loved what the younger girl was 
doing, she couldn&#39;t allow it to continue. Mai also wanted to enjoy 
Mikoto&#39;s body. She wanted to know the feeling of giving her pleasure.

Reluctantly tugging Mikoto away, Mai motioned for her to raise her arms 
in mock surrender. Seeing the outline of those petite breasts Mai slowly 
pulled the cotton garment over the younger girls head. The relished the 
little tremors Mikoto made as the fabric rasped against her hardened 
nipples. 

The now-nude girl obediently lay down when bidden and blushed deeply as 
Mai paused to take in her form. Though she&#39;d seen it many times, Mai had 
never truly appreciated the beautiful symmetry of Mikoto&#39;s young body. 
But before she allowed herself to be lost in this beauty, Mai set about 
the art of giving pleasure. 

She kissed both dark nipples but did not linger. Instead she allowed the 
room&#39;s air currents to play across the now-moistened flesh. She watched 
as those small fruits ripened and ignored Mikoto&#39;s small whimpers for 
relief. She instead rested on her elbows above her love, allowing her 
breasts, her nipples to trail up and down Mikoto&#39;s front. In their path 
little fires of pleasure sparked for them both. 

*Girls&#39; bodies are so much fun to play with* Mai recalled at a later 
date.

She was kissing her now, the taste of each other&#39;s body mingling 
together. It was all Mai could do to hold on as Mikoto took over, 
upendingMai and relieving her of her pajama bottoms. Mikoto&#39;s small 
hands began to explore, eliciting pleasure wherever they landed. 

Academically, Mai knew what was coming next but she had no preparation 
for it. Over the month she&#39;d spent dreaming of this night she would 
wonder how it would feel to have another touch her there. Mikoto&#39;s hands 
moved downward, paying homage to Mai&#39;s soft skin, now misted with 
perspiration. She now came near that place, that sacred shrine where a 
girl&#39;s most intimate treasure lay hidden. And entered.

A cry unlike anything in her experience tore its way from the depths of 
Mai&#39;s soul through her body and issued from her mouth. Excited by the 
unknowable sound Mikoto descended on Mai&#39;s moist folds, tasting and 
teasing, searching for the center of her pleasure. 

As Mikoto&#39;s agile tongue danced within her Mai wondered if she could use 
such a wonderful instrument for something so mundane as speech again. 
Such thoughts were forgotten as Mikoto found and made love to the 
clitoris. Mai&#39;s pleasure doubled, tripled. 

Later on Mai was a bit ashamed that her body could be played like a 
musical instrument. But with an artist like Mikoto, she was content to 
let her compose her masterworks. 

A voice that was not her own called out, urging her love to complete the 
work, to complete her. Memory and coherent thought dissolved into sound 
and sensation. 

Mikoto&#39;s amazing command of the female body pushed Mai past the veils 
and through the threshold of Climax. She was a plaything of sensation, a 
toy of pleasure. 

She barely recalled weeping shamelessly at the power of the moment. 
Mikoto allowing her to make her own attempt at bringing her to orgasm. 
The taste of her lover on her lips. The feel of her small body quaking 
with the release of pent up arousal. Mikoto&#39;s promise that Mai could 
practice on her as much as she liked in the future.

These were what Mai remembered best. And the look of unadulterated love 
on Mikoto&#39;s face as they finally drifted to sleep.

That kind of love frightened her. It was obsessive and possessive. It 
had a mind of its own and could creep in out of nowhere. But that kind 
of love was what they had for each other. That kind of love was the best 
kind.

That kind of love was always true.
