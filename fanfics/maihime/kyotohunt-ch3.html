Nao was fashionably late. She had no desire, after all, to go to that 
dump of a garage that Natsuki worked at during the day. The &quot;HiME 
Rangers&quot; had held a conference there after hours on more than one 
occasion to discuss various things. Kuga had a set of keys that opened 
up the work area of the building, and no one ever bothered them. The 
place was out of the way. And, Nao thought as she meandered towards the 
door, because it was disgusting. It smelt of gasoline, grime and sweat. 
Ignoring it as best she could, Nao opened the staff door next to the 
main garage vehicle doors, and found that things were as they usually 
were during such gatherings.

The &#39;staff lounge&#39; of the shabby little garage was a couple of couches 
and chairs situated next to a mini-fridge in the main work area. A pool 
of grease was next to the closest couch, and a disassembled motorcycle 
was not more than six feet away. Midori&#39;s truck, Natsuki&#39;s bike, and 
Shizuru&#39;s Jaguar were parked inside to avoid being seen by Searrs or the 
police. The building was dim, the early arrivals having only turned on 
one of the overhead lights. Nao inwardly groaned and externally gave a 
long face at the sight before her. She was not the last HiME to arrive. 
Yukino, Shiho, Akane and Yukariko were unaccounted for. The rest, 
however, were seated on the furniture or standing next to it.

She didn&#39;t say anything at first, lurking after having silently entered 
the building, listening to their banter and preliminary discussions. 
After a minute, she slinked forward, and caught the attention of a one 
Tokiha Mai. The former unofficial leader of the HiME gave a small smile 
after hanging up a cellphone, and waved. &quot;Good evening, Nao.&quot;

&quot;Did I miss cake and ice cream?&quot; Nao asked, preferring to stand behind 
the couch that Midori, Mikoto and Akira sat on, as opposed to sitting 
down.

Mikoto&#39;s eyes widened, and despite now being nineteen years of age, 
still looked very childlike. &quot;We get cake?&quot;

&quot;She was just kidding,&quot; Mai said with a small sigh, sitting in a chair 
facing the others and hoping that she wasn&#39;t obligated to make Mikoto a 
cake after getting her hopes up. &quot;Maybe we should start. I don&#39;t think 
the others will arrive. Akane and Yukino might be tied up with their 
jobs, and the other two haven&#39;t called back yet.&quot;

Natsuki sat in a chair that essentially placed her at the &#39;head&#39; of the 
group, and Shizuru sat cross-legged on the right arm of the chair, 
staying dutifully at her love&#39;s side. Nao thought it made Shizuru look 
very much like Natsuki&#39;s bitch. She was quite tempted to say such a 
thing out loud, too, but decided against it as the biker began to take 
charge and get things underway. The brawler prepared to shut down her 
brain as a defense against what was sure to start the most idiotic of 
conversations.

&quot;We&#39;re here to discuss...&quot; Natsuki began.

&quot;...the threat of Mordor.&quot; And, leave it to Midori to make a joke and 
end up being the only one laughing at it. Mai put a hand to her forehead 
and sighed over the interruption.

&quot;...what to do about Searrs,&quot; Natsuki at last concluded after giving the 
archaeologist a stare down. Midori was accepting enough of her defeat, 
and grabbed a beer from the fridge as Kuga continued. &quot;I&#39;d noticed a 
little more activity from them lately, but things had been relatively 
quiet for several months. Their down time must have had to do with 
finishing those... what were they?&quot;

&quot;Otome,&quot; Shizuru supplied, looking down at the biker who was at a loss 
for words. She, for a split second, felt a little like Yukino.

&quot;Yes, Otome. They must be an offshoot of the project Alyssa was a part 
of, now that Searrs was able to look into the Carnival up close and 
gather more data. They said we weren&#39;t their enemy, and I doubt Searrs 
would waste the effort to kill off powerless HiME. Their goal is 
probably the same as what we always thought Searrs&#39; was. To take us back 
for genetic study,&quot; Natsuki essentially &#39;briefed.&#39;

Akira shrugged. &quot;Don&#39;t they already have genetic information from you?&quot;

&quot;I was very young the last time I was around First District,&quot; Natsuki 
explained, but hoped to stay as ambiguous as possible. She still, after 
all that time, did not feel comfortable with opening up about her past. 
At least not to the group. &quot;The powers hadn&#39;t really manifested. They 
might be looking for changes now that we&#39;re older, and especially now 
that we&#39;ve had our abilities neutralized.&quot;

&quot;To perfect their little HiME freaks,&quot; Midori offered. &quot;What was with 
them losing their armor and weird robes? I haven&#39;t seen a girl shed 
articles that fast since...&quot;

The rest waited. Midori just ended up smiling sheepishly. Nao, however, 
offered a conclusion. &quot;...since Fujino and Kuga got carried away at last 
year&#39;s Christmas gathering?&quot;

&quot;Right, that,&quot; Midori agreed, covering up whatever other story she had 
been thinking of.

Shizuru smiled and gave a small shrug. &quot;You complained about there not 
being enough entertainment with my lack of a television.&quot;

&quot;Shizuru!&quot; Natsuki chastised, her face a delightful shade of red, all of 
which made Shizuru smile wider. Natsuki coughed and got back to the 
discussion. &quot;That... Topaz woman stopped her assault earlier on today, 
too. Maybe they can only materialize for so long. I hadn&#39;t expected the 
robes to be a materialization, though.&quot;

&quot;Maybe they&#39;re trying to show us up,&quot; Shizuru said with a wink.

Mai spoke up again. &quot;So, do you think they accessed my laptop before we 
got there, and maybe used it as bait? You said they weren&#39;t even 
searching the car. Isn&#39;t that a little odd?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it is,&quot; Akira replied. &quot;We need to switch our cell phones and 
email addresses first thing tomorrow. I&#39;m pretty sure they were waiting 
for us. Maybe we should stay at motels for the night.&quot;

&quot;So, then we&#39;re also going to have to&#151;&quot; Mai began to say, but was cut 
off by the door opening.

Or, more accurately, the door slamming against the wall as it was 
practically kicked open. It bounced against the wall, leaving a minor 
dent that Natsuki grimaced at. Her boss was not going to like that. A 
tall blonde woman in a police uniform marched through the door with an 
air of absolute authority, and trailing behind her was a young JSDF 
logistics officer and another, lower ranking officer, both looking 
fatigued. Whether that was from how late it was, or from their 
companion&#39;s behavior, the rest of the HiME didn&#39;t know. Suzushiro 
Haruka, a lieutenant in the Kyoto PD, stood there with an irritated 
expression, her arms crossed.

&quot;What the hell is the big idea, making all this extra work for me?&quot; 
Haruka barked. &quot;I get dragged out of bed by my captain to go help out 
with a gang war raging in the East side tunnel. The last thing Akane and 
I here had expected was to spot you people down there! Right, Akane?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; Sergeant Kurauchi Akane trailed off, not sure how to answer. A 
pair of tonfas were strapped to her belt, the best substitute for her 
Elements that she could find. She simply decided to go along with her 
angry boss. &quot;Yes, Haruka.&quot;

The blonde looked back, irritated.

&quot;I mean, yes, Lt. Suzushiro. My apologies,&quot; Akane bowed her head 
quickly, which seemed to be more than enough to make Haruka happy once 
again. She glanced at Yukino, who just held up a hand as a way of saying 
&#39;just let her go, she&#39;ll tire herself out soon.&#39;

&quot;To see the delinquent, the cross dresser, the drunk, and the lesbian 
rapist storm through my barricade without a care in the world shot my 
blood pressure through the roof! I know we&#39;re all in hiding from those 
Searrs freaks, but you don&#39;t have to run over cops just to see how much 
gore will wrap around your tires! I was nearly speechless!&quot;

Nearly, Akane thought dryly, recalling the woman&#39;s mad tirade just after 
Midori&#39;s truck had cleared the area. Her virgin ears were going to be 
bleeding for weeks after hearing such foul language.

&quot;As former Student Council president, I would have hoped at least you 
would have had the sense not to be so reckless, Fujino!&quot; Haruka 
reprimanded, marching up to her long time rival and thrusting a finger 
in her face. &quot;I thought we were all trying to keep low profiles.&quot;

Shizuru blinked once before giving Haruka the traditional 
almost-but-not-quite patronizing smile she had always reserved for her. 
&quot;Ah, Haruka, I&#39;m terribly sorry. But why were you continuing to block us 
when the other &#39;gang&#39; was running away? Shouldn&#39;t you have been going 
after them?&quot;

Haruka&#39;s left eye twitched at such a comment. Was Fujino calling her 
incompetent again?! &quot;Kaichou, you should not be so precocious about 
things when you didn&#39;t even see what we were up to!&quot;

&quot;Pretentious,&quot; Yukino piped up, falling back into her traditional role.

&quot;That&#39;s what I said.&quot;

&quot;Haruka, you think I am precocious? I am most flattered. I had always 
thought you did not care for me,&quot; Shizuru taunted. She ignored Natsuki 
sighing in frustration next to her. Or maybe it was jealousy, Shizuru 
thought. Yes, it was that. Natsuki did not like it when Shizuru 
tormented other people. Such sweet torture was for Natsuki alone. But, 
Shizuru mused happily, Natsuki got several other forms of pleasurable 
torture that Haruka would never receive. Right, she was supposed to be 
focusing on something, wasn&#39;t she? Right. The Otome!

&quot;Dammit, Fujino, I don&#39;t have to take this. We aren&#39;t in school anym&#151;&quot; 
Haruka&#39;s ranting was cut off by her more demure companion.

Yukino stepped forward and sat herself between Midori and Mikoto on the 
couch. &quot;Haruka, please calm down. It&#39;s quite all right. We&#39;re 
interrupting the conversation. Everyone, I&#39;m sorry we&#39;re late. Akane and 
Haruka were obviously delayed, and I just got off work a half an hour 
ago.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Natsuki said. &quot;We hadn&#39;t gotten very far. We were 
discussing the artificial HiME and their inability to materialize for 
more than a short while. Along with their motives, which we assume is to 
bring us in, as always.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; Yukino pushed up her glasses and typed a few things into a 
laptop she had brought with her. &quot;I&#39;m going to keep a record of 
everything observed. Just so we can put the pieces together as we go 
along. How many were there?&quot;

&quot;Three,&quot; Akira said. &quot;From what we know. Lapis, Onyx and Topaz.&quot;

Yukino nodded. &quot;They can materialize, but only for short bursts?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Nao said. &quot;Then they turn into grade-A pussies.&quot;

&quot;They can materialize both weapons and armor,&quot; Natsuki said. &quot;But I&#39;m 
wondering how they do it. Alyssa could remotely activate her Child, but 
couldn&#39;t ever materialize a weapon. I figured that she could tap into 
the same energy we could. Which, as we know now, was the Obsidian Lord.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s still around?&quot; Mikoto asked, sitting up. &quot;No more Carnivals! I&#39;ll 
rip it apart if it&#39;s behind this!&quot;

&quot;But it was destroyed. We saw it. So was the HiME star,&quot; Midori 
countered.

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Yukino began to venture, &quot;Searrs developed some sort of 
battery pack that allows the wearer to materialize weaponry, but it only 
has a limited service time. What do you think, Shizuru?&quot;

&quot;Possible, I suppose. Assuming Searrs found a way to replicate whatever 
the Obsidian Lord could do, or improved upon the project Alyssa was a 
part of.&quot; Shizuru leaned back against the chair, lost in thought.

Mai interrupted, then. &quot;Speaking of that, we should really try to find 
Miyu and Alyssa. They haven&#39;t called back yet. Does anyone know where to 
find them?&quot;

She only heard silenced until Yukino spoke up again. &quot;No, I guess not. 
Just keep calling, perhaps? In the meantime, I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t do some 
research into some kind of new device or new Searrs activity. I think we 
should all try to keep our eyes and ears out for Searrs and the Otome. 
Maybe if you can capture an Otome and pin her down, you can find the 
source of her power.&quot;

&quot;A good idea. We should all stay in the city and be on call for any kind 
of fight,&quot; Natsuki said. &quot;What about Shiho and Yukariko?&quot;

&quot;Shiho is at Kyoto University, and seems content there. She doesn&#39;t 
really speak to Tate or I much. She&#39;s probably still upset over the fact 
that we&#39;re dating. It naturally did not sit well with her,&quot; Mai 
explained. &quot;I&#39;ll try talking to her and see if she can&#39;t help in some 
way.&quot;

Natsuki nodded. But Akane piped up next to Haruka a second later. &quot;I&#39;ve 
tried calling Yukariko for months now, and I haven&#39;t gotten anything 
back. I know we&#39;re all a little busy, but I&#39;m a little worried. Has 
anyone actually seen her?&quot;

Again, there was a long silence. Mai looked around. &quot;No one?&quot;

&quot;Haruka, Akane... since you&#39;re in law enforcement, maybe you can track 
her down for us,&quot; Natsuki requested, looking up to the pair. &quot;When you 
aren&#39;t busy, of course. You&#39;d have more resources to work with than the 
rest of us.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do it,&quot; Akane said with a nod.

Haruka sighed and tapped her fingers against her hips. &quot;Fine, but if I 
get caught, it&#39;s on your head.&quot;

&quot;So! We&#39;re uniting again and reassembling the HiME Rangers to fight for 
justice!&quot; Midori cheered, partially joking. A few others managed to 
laugh at the memories of a certain karaoke party that followed the 
original assembly.

Nao sneered, pacing a bit behind the left couch. &quot;Hardly. Searrs just 
needs its ass kicked.&quot;

&quot;For great justice,&quot; Midori added, grinning from ear to ear.

&quot;Which can easily be done independently,&quot; Nao countered. Teamwork was 
overrated. The last time they tried this, she lost an eye. And damn it 
all, she liked her eyes just where they were. Being half blind was not a 
pleasant experience, and she had no desire to repeat it. &quot;Emails are 
good enough contact.&quot;

&quot;We can overpower them in groups.&quot; Midori seemed intent on continuing 
the second round of the teamwork vs. solo work battle that had raged 
during the Rangers&#39; original assembly. &quot;You know the stance. Just like 
last time.&quot;

&quot;Last time, we all killed each other. Or in Kuga&#39;s case, killed herself. 
Do you want to kill yourself, teacher?&quot; Nao&#39;s words were, as always, 
laced with sarcasm.

&quot;I have more rope,&quot; Midori said.

That shut her up. Natsuki stood up, not looking all too happy, perhaps 
because of Nao&#39;s verbal jab. &quot;We&#39;re working as a team, and that is that. 
Like I said before, we should meet when there&#39;s a fight and stay ready 
for such an occasion in case we have to spring into action. Yukino and I 
will research Searrs. In the meantime, we&#39;ll see if we can&#39;t capture an 
Otome. Is that understood?&quot;

Everyone replied with either a nod or a similar affirmative answer. 
Except for a certain redhead. &quot;Dammit, Kuga, when did you get to be the 
leader?&quot;

&quot;When you let me,&quot; Natsuki countered. Mai looked away with a small sigh, 
focusing on the floor. Maybe it was for the best.

&quot;It&#39;s three in the morning,&quot; Shizuru informed. &quot;We should go home and 
get some rest if we want to deal with any of this tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Jesus, I have work in three hours,&quot; Midori groaned. She stumbled up 
from the couch and wobbled towards the garage doors. &quot;I gotta go. Talk 
to you all later.&quot;

Haruka marched after her, getting right in her face and then looking her 
up and down. &quot;Teacher, are you really safe to drive? You were drinking 
alcohol. Let me test your blood alcohol level before you go.&quot;

Midori put her palm against Haruka&#39;s face and shoved her out of the way. 
&quot;Your breath smells like garlic.&quot;

Haruka screeched as Midori meandered to the doors, opening them so that 
she could get her truck out. She climbed into the vehicle and started 
the engine up, giving everyone a wave after making sure no weapons had 
been left behind in the bed. With a wink, she shifted to reverse and 
backed out of the building, driving down the street that would take her 
back home. The others watched her go for a moment, then prepared to 
leave themselves. Work and school awaited most in just a few hours, 
after all.

&quot;I&#39;ll take everyone home who doesn&#39;t have their vehicle with them,&quot; 
Shizuru offered. She looked back to the biker and said, &quot;You go ahead 
and head home. I&#39;ll meet you in a bit. Okay?&quot;

Natsuki nodded. &quot;Fine, but hurry up.&quot;

&quot;I know, I know, you cannot fall asleep without something to snuggle 
wi&#151;&quot; Shizuru began to say, but a gloved hand clamped down over her 
mouth, shutting out the words.

&quot;S-Shizuru!&quot;

A string of giggles from nearby friends sprung up, and Natsuki once 
again turned a shade of red. Damn that woman! Natsuki marched to her 
bike and started it. &quot;Everyone get out of here so I can lock up!&quot;

&quot;Awfully bossy for someone who got held back two grades,&quot; Nao chided as 
she walked to the door. &quot;Sorry, Shizuru, I don&#39;t need any rides from you 
tonight.&quot;

&quot;I am crushed,&quot; Shizuru replied in a similar tone, getting into her own 
car.

Nao left, and the rest of the HiMEs followed, Shizuru acting as taxi for 
several. Natsuki was the last to go, glad for the moments of silence 
that followed. She pulled her bike out of the garage and locked up again 
after removing all evidence of their nightly visit. Everything settled, 
she got back on the bike and raced back home, avoiding all major roads 
in case the police or Searrs were still lurking about. Work in five 
hours. Lord almighty, those Otome needed a nice slap across the face for 
the fatigue she was going to feel in the morning. Maybe she should take 
a sick day. For that matter, maybe Shizuru should too.

- - -

They lived so far out in the woods that the only sounds to greet them in 
the morning were chirping birds and a babbling brook, rather than 
honking horns and police sirens. It was absolute bliss, even for the 
urban-centric Natsuki. She held a phone in her hands, and dialed a 
familiar number while her partner stirred next to her.

&quot;Hello? G&#39;morning, Vic.&quot;

Natsuki suppressed a groan as she attempted to, and failed to, ignore 
the lips and teeth clamped down on her collarbone. She slammed her hand 
down over the bottom half of the phone just long enough to take in a 
much needed sharp breath.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m not feeling very well.&quot;

Now as hard as it was to believe, that was a lie. She felt very well 
right now. Too well for this particular phone call. She tried to bat 
Shizuru away as a hand slid up her thigh.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t have a hangover. I think I caught that flu Oda had. I&#39;m 
sure I&#39;ll be fine in a day.&quot;

She saw a certain someone mouth the word &#39;two&#39; before the lips returned 
to the sensitive flesh of her neck, hands roaming up her stomach and 
towards her chest. Phone conversation needed to end now. Bad talkative 
boss. The urge to moan was almost too much to suppress.

&quot;Yes, sir, I will. I...&quot;

Her boss interrupted her again, and she bit her lips to stop any wayward 
noises from escaping her throat. She no longer tried to shoo Shizuru 
away for the moment, and instead found herself caressing the other 
woman&#39;s hair as the Kyoto woman continued with what she was doing.

&quot;Okay. Goodbye. Have a nice day.&quot; Sweet freedom.

She found herself instantly pinned down on the bed the moment she hung 
up the phone, and finally released the moan she&#39;d been holding back, 
surrendering herself to the crimson eyed brunette, at least for the 
moment. Both had only gotten about four hours of sleep before they each 
had to call in sick to work, which had technically been Natsuki&#39;s idea, 
but Shizuru was more adamant about it after the other jokingly mentioned 
it. Shizuru and Natsuki were &#39;sick&#39; quite often, it seemed. But they had 
sick days to spare, and it was a waste to not use them! They&#39;d be 
staying in bed all day, anyway. Close enough.

And, after the bliss was over and all favors had been repaid in full, 
the two wandered back off into dreamland. It was still early, after all. 
They woke up again around eleven, or at least Natsuki did. It wasn&#39;t 
often that she was the first one awake, being such a heavy sleeper. But, 
she lie trapped in Shizuru&#39;s embrace, not willing to move lest she 
disturb the other woman. Natsuki took the time to look down at her 
lover&#39;s peaceful face, marveling at how beautiful she looked and how she 
was not worthy of having such a...

Natsuki smacked Shizuru in the face. &quot;Wake up.&quot;

Shizuru brought her hand up to her cheek and made an annoyed grunt. &quot;Ow! 
I do all these wonderful things to you and this is how you wake me? 
Ingrate. I&#39;ve never been with a woman who had such a callous bedside 
manner.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I mean, you&#39;re the only one for me, my Natsuki.&quot;

Natsuki grumbled and rolled onto her other side, facing away from the 
other female, ignoring any stray thoughts that would have made her 
jealous. Peering over the edge of the bed, she located most of her 
clothes, but it didn&#39;t really matter much. She gathered them up, slid 
out of bed, and tossed them in her basket of dirty clothes before 
walking off towards the shower, knowing full well Shizuru was watching 
her every move with a halfway amused expression. Shizuru restrained 
herself for several long minutes before she too made her way to the 
shower.

So another hour passed before either of them decided that clothing was 
not simply optional, and both sat down to lunch, having slept through 
(kind of) breakfast. Shizuru made the pair sandwiches, well trained by 
that point to engorge the other one with far too much flavored 
mayonnaise, no matter how much it disgusted her. Honor thy fallen 
comrade well, Shizuru thought about herself in the third person, for she 
is completely and utterly whipped. After both had finished their meal, 
business took hold.

&quot;I&#39;ll run into town and get new phones,&quot; Natsuki said. &quot;Do you want to 
come with me?&quot;

Shizuru was about to say something less than pleasant, given their day 
thusfar, but did not. Instead, she genuinely smiled and said, &quot;When was 
the last time I declined a motorcycle trip?&quot;

&quot;You mean, when was the last time you declined to cling to my waist and 
have an excuse for it?&quot;

&quot;That too.&quot;

Natsuki chuckled quietly, taking both their plates back into the kitchen 
and rising them. She paused before re-entering the living area where 
Shizuru still sat on her ankles, not quite sure how to bring up a 
particular subject. They both hadn&#39;t really talked about it for a long 
time, and it probably still wasn&#39;t a conversation Shizuru wanted to 
have. Never the less, it had to be done. So, Natsuki took a breath and 
walked back, sitting down beside her so close that their shoulders were 
almost touching.

&quot;Natsuki?&quot;

&quot;Y-yes?&quot;

&quot;Personal space,&quot; Shizuru said, looking down at her shoulder and 
Natsuki&#39;s. Probably not a usual comment of hers, but she had a bad 
feeling. This was indication of a serious talk.

&quot;Want to talk to you,&quot; Natsuki began to say. Damn.

&quot;I&#39;m not deaf, I can hear you two feet away. Silly girl.&quot;

Natsuki ignored her and brought the subject up before she lost the 
nerve. Not that she was a coward or anything. &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking that 
we should get an apartment in the city. In addition to this place. We 
have the money. It would be a lot easier, especially with Searrs&#39; recent 
activity. If they were to attack now, we&#39;d have to drive all the way 
back here to get our weapons, or drive all the way over there to assist. 
We&#39;re a ways out.&quot;

Shizuru nodded but said nothing.

&quot;It&#39;ll be cheaper in terms of commuting,&quot; Natsuki offered. She tried to 
be uncharacteristically aggressive despite her still very shy and 
reclusive nature. &quot;We could sleep in later too.&quot;

&quot;Ara, well that makes everything better,&quot; Shizuru joked. At least 
something had made her smile. She went quiet after that for several 
minutes, Natsuki staring at her, awaiting a response. &quot;I... don&#39;t know. 
It sounds logical enough. I simply do not feel comfortable, even now. 
But if it is what Natsuki wants.&quot;

Natsuki took a breath. &quot;Sometimes, you simply have to face your fears. 
I&#39;ve come to realize the world is actually quite forgiving. You&#39;re not 
the same person you were then, you know?&quot;

&quot;Forgiving...&quot; Shizuru repeated, but then trailed off, lost in thought. 
She turned to Natsuki and gave her what was obviously a forced smile on 
her part. &quot;Why don&#39;t we buy a newspaper or an apartment listing while 
we&#39;re in town? We can look places over this evening.&quot;

Natsuki nodded. &quot;Very well. This will still be our main home, but it&#39;s 
best if we&#39;re close. Out here... I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s like racing into 
danger from the seclusion of the bat cave.&quot;

Shizuru blinked. Sometimes it was hard for her to catch a few of 
Natsuki&#39;s references to media, having never been one for comic books 
while the biker had a small and secret collection hidden in their room. 
But due to much talking on Natsuki&#39;s part about the inner workings of 
tight wearing superheroes, she grasped the meaning of that particular 
reference. &quot;Holy ambiguously gay duo, BatNat.&quot;

Natsuki stared at her for a moment before breaking into a rare fit of 
laughter that only Shizuru seemed capable of generating. &quot;What?!&quot;

&quot;Saturday Night Live and the old Batman? Or did I miss something again?&quot; 
Shizuru asked, hoping she hadn&#39;t referenced the wrong thing. It was all 
so difficult. She made an ass of herself half the time when it came to 
popular culture. She&#39;d never really been one for television. Especially 
American television. Those people were too crazy.

&quot;Uh, no, you got it,&quot; Natsuki replied, her voice still full of mirth. 
Shizuru smiled in relief. Okay, so she wasn&#39;t laughing at her, just at 
the joke. Good. Natsuki stood up and moved towards the entrance of their 
home. &quot;I&#39;m going to go warm up the bike. Grab your coat and the spare 
helmet, and let&#39;s go.&quot;

Shizuru obeyed, opening the closet while Natsuki went outside. She heard 
the distinct roar of the engine while she pulled on a well tailored 
jacket and removed the spare helmet Natsuki had stored on the top shelf. 
It was black and red, to match Natsuki&#39;s, bought not long after 
Shizuru&#39;s graduation. It had been her graduation present, actually. 
Natsuki&#39;s first attempt to bind Shizuru to her life, long before the 
biker had admitted to her own feelings. Because no matter how far 
Shizuru intended to run from society, she would still be obligated to be 
around Natsuki and the motorcycle. At least, that was the motivation 
behind the gift. It&#39;d worked.

She slid the helmet over her head and put the visor down, walking out of 
the house and climbing onto the back of the bike. The bitch seat, as 
Natsuki sometimes referred to it. It was the unofficial term used by 
bikers, apparently. Shizuru always huffed and insist that she drive if 
that were the case. Natsuki didn&#39;t seem intent on letting Shizuru be in 
charge of riding the motorcycle. The last time Natsuki let her was in 
high school and it hadn&#39;t been Shizuru&#39;s crowning moment. Nor had it 
been Natsuki&#39;s, swearing incessantly over the scratches that had 
resulted from... well, it wasn&#39;t important. No scratches on it now.

Shizuru rested her hands on Natsuki&#39;s stomach, causing the other woman 
to involuntarily tense up, despite everything. Shizuru smiled at that. 
How... cute. &quot;Ready when you are, darling.&quot;

Natsuki twitched an eye at the term, but revved the engine and slowly 
pulled out of the bike&#39;s storage area. She always drove slower when 
Shizuru was with her. Not because Shizuru hated speed &#150; far from it. She 
often egged Natsuki on to race other people, so unlike a responsible 
former kaichou. Natsuki just never felt comfortable, just in case she 
finally bit the dust thanks to some foolish accident. Shizuru was too 
pretty to have her face hit the asphalt at a hundred miles an hour.

When they got onto the main highway, Natsuki picked up speed and gently 
smiled as Shizuru tightened her grip on her, lips hidden by the helmet.

Mai, as promised, walked down to Kyoto University that afternoon, 
running over a hundred different things to possibly say to the somewhat 
antisocial Shiho. The two hadn&#39;t been on good terms for a very long 
time, but for some reason it felt like it was the right thing to talk to 
her directly. One of the other HiMEs may not have had the same impact. 
Maybe Mai&#39;s direct involvement would properly display the severity of 
the situation the HiME Rangers were now in. She found her way to the 
dorms, where Akira probably was as well. Both started during the same 
year. So did Nao, but she had dropped out (or was rather kicked out) 
last term, which was none too surprising.

Having vaguely known the dorm number in her head, she found her way to 
the proper door. And there she paused, looking at the outside of it, 
fixated on the number itself for several moments. She felt very... 
nervous, to put it simply. Even despite being the girl&#39;s elder. But, Mai 
summoned the courage and knocked on the door three times, holding her 
breath until it was opened.

The door swung open, revealing a much older and mature Shiho, who now 
looked very much like a beautiful woman. Her hair was tied back in a 
braid, not in her stereotypical &#39;octopus head&#39; style. Maybe she had 
gotten sick of Nao&#39;s taunting. Her expression was one of neutrality. 
There was neither hate nor any hint of welcoming in her eyes. A 
sociology textbook was in her hands, Shiho having obviously been 
studying before Mai&#39;s interruption.

&quot;Hello, Mai.&quot;

&quot;Good afternoon,&quot; Mai said politely. She looked down the hall to avert 
her gaze for a half second. A nervous habit. &quot;I need to talk with you 
for a few minutes. Something happened last night.&quot;

Shiho stepped to the side, allowing Mai to enter her dorm room. Her 
roommate was absent, apparently. Shiho absently picked up a few articles 
of clothing lying around and tossed them where they really belonged. 
Fearing that something had happened to her beloved &#39;onii-chan,&#39; she 
allowed Mai to take a seat in a small chair. &quot;Is everything all right? 
I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t answer my phone last night. I had the ringer off. I 
was out.&quot;

&quot;We were attacked last night,&quot; Mai said simply. Shiho&#39;s eyes widened. 
&quot;It was Searrs. They&#39;re onto us again. And...&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t change my identity again,&quot; Shiho interrupted, &quot;I&#39;ve been 
working too hard in school to lose everything now.&quot;

Mai took a breath. &quot;I know. We aren&#39;t... we&#39;re uniting together and 
going to fight back now. We&#39;ve had enough. The HiME had a meeting last 
night. Shiho, they&#39;ve engineered at least three fake HiME that can 
materialize weapons and even armor. They were the ones who attacked us. 
That&#39;s the reason we&#39;ve reached a breaking point. We can&#39;t allow any 
more girls to suffer the same fate as Alyssa.&quot;

Shiho tossed her textbook on her bed, making a disgruntled face. &quot;So 
Midori must have thrown another karaoke party.&quot;

&quot;Not this time,&quot; Mai said with a smile, trying to embrace Shiho&#39;s 
attempt at being lighthearted. &quot;But we&#39;d like everyone to help out. This 
is probably going to be a final stand against Searrs. I know you&#39;re busy 
with school, and I&#39;m honestly proud at the work you&#39;ve done, being at 
the top of your class. Things just might be a little hectic for a while, 
and knowing we have another person watching out for us would be 
comforting.&quot;

The younger woman was silent for a moment, pondering what exactly that 
would mean. &quot;If you need a place to stay or money, then I guess I can 
help out. But what do you expect me to do in terms of fighting? My 
Element was a flute, for god sakes. Without my Child, I&#39;m nothing. I 
don&#39;t even have any kind of fighting skills beyond basic self defense 
thanks to a required class.&quot;

Mai laughed bitterly. Shiho didn&#39;t understand.

&quot;What?&quot;

Mai waved the comment off. &quot;Just that I can understand that feeling &#150; 
being useless without our powers. It&#39;s difficult to go from being 
someone who could destroy naval ships and scorch the earth to... a chef 
that is not capable of harming another person. I can&#39;t fight either.&quot;

&quot;Then what do you expect to do for the &#39;Rangers&#39; with combat abilities?&quot; 
Shiho asked.

That was a very good question. She still hadn&#39;t yet got accustomed with 
her new role. She could not longer fight. She&#39;d considered taking up 
martial arts or learning out to shoot a gun, but what was the point? 
Shizuru had been familiar with staves since a young age due to her 
upbringing. Natsuki had devoted her life to fighting after her accident. 
Akira was trained to fight since she could walk and had mastered almost 
all forms of combat, as had Mikoto. Nao was a child of the streets and 
while she lacked formal training, she had endless experience. Midori 
seemed more than familiar with her weapon as well. And Mai? Mai knew CPR 
and how to speak English. If they were drowning off the coast of Los 
Angeles, she&#39;d be fine. Otherwise, Mai only stood in the shadow of the 
aggressive princesses.

&quot;I can&#39;t fight, but I know a little about medicine and healthcare. I can 
be there to give them moral support if things go downhill. I can give 
them a place to stay and food to eat,&quot; Mai began. &quot;I can&#39;t charge into 
the battle with them, but there&#39;s more to a fight for liberation than 
the fighting itself. All of us have something to offer.&quot;

Shiho stared at her for a moment before laughing slightly. &quot;You make it 
sound like a revolutionary war. I think you&#39;ve been hanging around 
Midori for too long. Her romantic notion of justice and freedom is 
rubbing off on you.&quot;

Mai shrugged and attempted a smile. &quot;Will you help, though? If not in 
fighting, then just in moral support.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Shiho said, &quot;I guess I will.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Mai stood, straightening her coat.

&quot;Call me if you need anything, then.&quot;

Mai nodded and moved towards the door. When she grabbed for the handle, 
she turned back to Shiho, who was watching her like a hawk. Mai was 
silent for a moment, wondering whether she should say it or not. She 
swallowed, her throat dry. &quot;You should stop by the apartment sometime, 
Shiho. Tate misses you. I do too.&quot;

The other redhead did not reply for a good long moment. &quot;We&#39;ll see.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll see you around,&quot; Mai said in farewell.

She exited the dorm room and shut the door behind her, releasing a long 
sigh. But at least she accomplished her goal. She looked back at the 
dorm room for a moment before walking down the hall and back out onto 
the street. She&#39;d given Shiho quite a bit of time. Perhaps the bridge 
burnt between them was simply too great for any future friendship to be 
feasible. But Mai genuinely wished that the younger girl try. It was not 
only awkward for her and Mai, but for Tate as well, caught between the 
two of them on more than one occasion. But Shiho was, in some odd sense, 
like a sister she had become estranged to. And it had been that way for 
at least four years, starting from the time that Mai and Tate had 
formally started to court each other.

Mai put a smile on her face, pushing the negative thoughts from her 
mind. Well! Lunch break was over. Time to get back to work.

A few hours later, in the late afternoon, Yukino was idly typing into 
her terminal in Kyoto&#39;s main military complex. It was always slow work. 
Perhaps she should have followed Haruka into law enforcement. They 
weren&#39;t busy either, but at least they did more than the military. Her 
tasks simply included observation of borders and shuffling around 
in-city troops. And because of that, her job was mainly sitting there 
and drinking coffee while occasionally sending emails to her superior 
officers. She sighed and sat back in her chair, looking at the large map 
of Japan on the far wall. Everything was nominal.

&quot;Hitome,&quot; someone addressed her by the fake name she&#39;d used for the last 
year or so, &quot;do you want anything from the vending machines?&quot;

It was one of the other logistics officers getting up from the oh so 
strenuous work. Smiling kindly, &#39;Hitome&#39; shook her head. &quot;No, but thank 
you for asking.&quot;

The other woman left her seat and headed out into the hall while Yukino 
fought with her temptation to take a nap right there in her chair. She 
nearly did, her eyes closing for what she thought would be a blink but 
ended up with a prolonged journey towards slumber. Her terminal started 
to beep, but it took her a moment to realize just what the noise meant. 
But in a minute, she snapped to attention, her almost-nap over the 
second she saw the blinking light on the interface. She typed various 
commands and in half a second, a dozen windows of satellite and other 
video feeds were opened. Her eyes darted to each one.

One of the outposts beyond Kyoto&#39;s city limits had activated a distress 
signal. She initially thought that in some unexpected turn of events 
that the remnants of the long since defeated DPRK had started some kind 
of guerilla operation. Instead, bringing up the outpost&#39;s video system, 
she saw a lone female armed with a bow and wearing a turquoise robe. A 
moment later, that video was killed, one of the energy arrows puncturing 
the camera as the woman returned to paying attention to the guards on 
duty.

&quot;Sir!&quot; Yukino shouted, getting the commander&#39;s attention.

&quot;What is it, Lt. Ishiguro?&quot;

&quot;Outpost 23-A is under attack by an unknown enemy! Camera systems are 
being destroyed. Looks like only one or two operatives,&quot; she informed, 
still rapidly typing into her terminal.

Her commanding officer sprung up from his seat and looked to her screen. 
After a moment, he said, &quot;Dispatch a regiment of Kyoto troops to deal 
with it. Now. Have regular police block off the road out there.&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir!&quot;

He returned to his own chair, watching feeds from there. Yukino put the 
orders into effect with two phone calls via her terminal &#150; one to the 
base and another to Haruka. But, being discreet, she also made a third 
call, knowing Haruka would be too busy to deal with bringing in the 
&#39;real&#39; reinforcements...

Next Episode: Army, Police and HiME scramble to reach the outpost before 
the Otome can flee. But what is that Otome after, and which group will 
be successful in getting to her? She dives into the JSDF database, but 
for what purpose? Episode 1.4: &quot;Violation&quot; coming soon!

Notes:
JSDF: Japanese Self-Defense Force(s)
DPRK: Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea (in this case, remnant 
troops after a fictional Second Korean War)
