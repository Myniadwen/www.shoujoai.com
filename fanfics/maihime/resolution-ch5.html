<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sons of  Plunder / My letter #2</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai’s  recovery was accepted by the group without discussion, as a quarrel  between lovers might have been accepted once it was resolved. None of  them wanted to reopen the wound again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  eased the van into one of the many open parking spots on Goza’s  main drag, a street about a mile long, filled with bars, deliberately  quaint clothing stores, a grocery store, a movie theater, and enough  little restaurants to make your stomach bulge out of your pants just  looking at them.  She was a lot better at parking than Reito, who  didn’t seem to mind this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As the  twelve of them finished piling out and Midori locked the car up, it  occurred to all of them, more or less simultaneously, that none of  them had any sort of idea what they were going to do.  They had all  come with different ideas in mind, and now that they were here, in a  group, they all realized that arguing over it would make them much  like a starfish whose legs all wanted to move in different  directions.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Thus,  they all remained quiet for about a minute, all wanting to speak, all  wanting different things:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Aoi, who  was generally passive, really wanted to go looking for a new  swimsuit, mostly because she had unintentionally peed in her old one  a little while Chie teased her, and she didn’t really want to wash  it out for fear of being questioned about it.  Also, she generally  just enjoyed shopping as a pastime.  Her secret dirty habit.  She  was, however, willing to go with just about anything that Chie  proposed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As it  happened, Chie wouldn’t have minded helping Aoi pick out a new  swimsuit.  She also wouldn’t have minded letting Tate help<em> her </em>pick out a new swimsuit, although she’d never say anything of  the sort.  He was cute, but he was Mai’s. <em>But a girl can  daydream, can’t she? </em>But she respected his and Mai’s unspoken  relationship all the same.  The girl had enough trouble as it was,  she thought.  No reason to make more for her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiho  wouldn’t have minded letting Tate pick her out a swimsuit either,  but she wasn’t thinking about that; she was actually thinking of  the massive pit in her stomach. She hadn’t really gotten much food.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori,  of course, wanted to sample several bars’ goods before the night  came and she was forced to choose between them.  She had her fake  I.D. with her, and god damnit, she was <em>thirsty. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akane  and Kazuya were the only two people who generally agreed on what they  wanted to do, which was find a place to be alone, <em>away </em>from  that damned camera-phone of Chie’s.  (She had gotten the picture  she had been after, though she promised not to do anything evil with  it, provided they got their asses in gear and piled into the car. She  had ways of getting what she wanted.)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki,  as embarrassing as it was, actually <em>did </em>want to find some  local color to add to her collection. She couldn’t help feeling  that she’d forgotten something back at the cabin, though.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  knew what Natsuki wanted, and to help her out with that.  Failing  that, she wouldn’t have minded a movie.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What  Tate <em>really </em>wanted was some time to talk with Mai, but the  added weight on his arm, along with Reito’s subtle grin at him,  basically signaling to the younger boy that <em>I do indeed remember  our agreement, and you damned well better, as well, </em>told him that this was not happening anytime soon.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mikoto  wanted to go to a grocery store with Mai.  She also wanted Mai to  cook whatever she bought in this grocery store, <em>in </em>the grocery  store.  It didn’t sound strange to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai,  however, already had her eyes locked onto the Karaoke joint they had  parked not fifty yards from.  It was fairly clear that those eyes  weren’t letting go until somebody promised her that she was going  to be singing that night.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  wanted to follow somebody else around, for once.  Aside from that, he  had no preference; in reality, he had a very private distaste for the  town, and small towns in general.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midori  could almost sense the explosion coming, and knew she had to act fast  to avert disaster.  She watched Mikoto licking her lips, preparing to  speak as soon as somebody else did; saw Chie’s eyes flicking  around, prepared for a verbal battle the likes of which this small  town had never seen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  have to talk fast, or there will be a ruckus. </em>In a moment of  wild fantasy, Midori envisioned the “ruckus” spiraling out of  control, to a point where the chaos was absolute, destruction  imminent, and where only her good looks and talent stood between the town and  annihilation at the hands of a bunch of <em>you’re just as young as  they are.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another  fantasy ruined at the hands of her young age and old wisdom. Wisdom  she had gotten from…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  should all split up,” Natsuki said firmly.  “I have a few things  I want to check out on my own.”  Midori’s face sank, and she  cursed her<br />
      <em>immaturity</em><br />
  lack  of speed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright,”  she said, taking charge.  “We can meet back here in…” she  checked her watch.  “Four hours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Drinking  before 5, Midori? </em>A little voice in her head chastised.  She  called it “sensibility.” <em>Tsk tsk. </em>Somebody said  something, and people began to move, but she was no longer paying  attention.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m  not drinking. I’m </em>sampling.  She rebutted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“Sampling”  until you inebriate yourself.  How many nights have you actually been </em>sober <em>since—</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>don’t  think about that…don’t think about that…don’t think about  that…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Why?  Afraid to admit that maybe all of that </em>most precious one <em>shit  was about as valuable as what you vomit up when you’re drunk?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>…don’t  think about that. NOT THINKING ABOUT THAT. HAVING A GOOD TIME ON  VACATION NOT THINKING ABOUT THAT.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Midori,”  said a formal voice; it wasn't unpleasant at all, but it was nonetheless just about the <em>last </em>thing she wanted:  Male interference.  She looked up  and saw Reito standing in front of her inoffensively.  “I don’t  have anywhere in particular to go, so I wonder if you might want some  company.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t think you’d enjoy the places I’m going,” Midori said, a  little too coldly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  might surprise you,” Reito smiled.  He really did have a lovely  smile.  She couldn’t tell whether or not he was being disingenuous,  but his smile really was…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She felt  like she had to throw up.  If she continued this conversation, she  probably would have to throw up. Of course, if she did what she was  planning to do, she would throw up many times, but that was  different. (She’d have liked to be able to say that she held her  liquor well, but she didn’t; she was a small Japanese woman who  couldn’t have weighed more than 135 after a big meal, and most of  what she <em>did </em>weigh was from muscle, not fat).</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,”  she shrugged.  “I’m not…” she let it hang.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  frowned. “You’re not what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  frowned back after a moment. <em>What </em>had <em>I meant to say?  That I’m not “that kind of woman”? What kind of woman is that,  exactly?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know what? I honestly have no idea.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He gave  her a strange look, and she wondered how much about her own situation <em>he </em>knew.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  I’ll come with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shook her head again.  “Nuh-uh.  You’re too nice a boy for that  kind of business.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He gave  her a stranger look, and she cursed at herself.  “Not <em>that </em>kind  of business, you pervert!”  She realized she’d said this a bit  too loud, and looked around quickly, only to find that everybody else  had dispersed.  “Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  worry about it.”  His smile was a little warmer now.  A little more  lady-killing.  “You’re going bar-hopping, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  sputtered a little. She had only ever called it that to Youko, who  would only nod and demand that she quit dragging her ass. To the few  others</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">o<em>ne  other</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">she had ever had to explain it to, she called it “creative  sightseeing” or, if absolutely necessary, “going out for a sip.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,”  she muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  been a while, but I think I can still do the dance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  blinked once, twice, three times a lady and she still didn’t  believe it.  “You.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you sure somebody didn’t just drop your unconscious body into a puddle of beer once?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Positive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You,”  she repeated, completely unable to reconcile the stand-up, straight-backed Reito  standing in front of her with her image of the standard male barfly  that she encountered: Stained shirt, unfocused eyes, large (or small)  erection that he tried desperately to conceal while he talked to her  in a vain attempt to get the opportunity to use it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is it  really that hard to believe?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  polite thing to say would have been, <em>well, it’s a little  out-of-character for you, </em>which was probably why her vehement  reply was something like, “<em>Yes!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I <em>do </em>go to a university now; in fact, I go to the same one that you do,” he offered in a brotherly, <em>you know  how it goes</em> tone.  He seemed genuinely confused by her reaction,  but that, she knew, could have been as much of an act as half of the  other faces he put forth to the world.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He shook  his head.  “You don’t get around there much, do you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  struck a nerve without meaning to, and she clamped her teeth down on  her tongue to stop herself from screaming something to the effect of, <em>What the fuck do you mean by </em>that, <em>you snide piece of  blue-blooded </em>shit  Instead, she just glared, and he  backed down a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was silence for a moment as the tension in the air built to a climax.  Midori wanted him gone.  She wanted him gone right now. She  wanted to be by herself for a while and build up a nice healthy buzz  so that she could deal with him again, because she would have to deal  with him eventually.  They were living in the same cabin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry,” he said quietly, meeting her glare with a soft gaze of his  own.  “I didn’t mean that like it sounded.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How <em>did</em> you mean it, exactly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  frowned.  “There’s no way to say it right now without digging  myself into a deeper pit than I’m already in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  pretty hard to dig yourself any deeper than where you are right now,” she  countered.  “Try me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  just meant that I never see you around the campus is all.  We go to  the same university, and I know you’re working pretty hard on your  thesis, but—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not working on my thesis anymore,” she said quietly. “There’s  no reason to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?  Just because the HiME star is gone, that means there’s no reason to  make a comprehensive chronicle of its existence?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  don’t get it, you snide fuck, and I don’t think you ever will. </em>“Leave me alone, Reito,” she said evenly.  “I don’t want  any of what you’re offering.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not sure I understand, but I’ll do as you ask,” he smiled, his voice  strangely devoid of any sense of defeat. At that, he turned, almost on  his heel, and walked off without another word, his gait neither cheery  nor dejected.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reito  stuck one hand in his pocket and shook his head, genuinely concerned  about Midori.  In spite of being a closet letch, an excellent actor,  and a big fat phony sometimes, he was still a decent human being, and  he felt a hefty dose of decent human concern at this point for the  girl, who had reacted so intensely when the subject of the university  and her thesis had been brought up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  there she goes into a bar she’s never been in before at one in the  afternoon, when only the really shitty drunks are in, to work herself  into a nice slobbery stupor in a town that fills up with thousands of  tourists sometime near dark. </em>There was nothing more dangerous  than getting drunk by yourself in a place where nobody knew you and  you returned the favor, except maybe for getting drunk in a place  where nobody knew anybody else at all, and she was about to combine  the two.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  certainly wasn’t the first underhanded act Reito Kanzaki had ever  engaged in, and it probably wouldn’t be the last, either.  In what  appeared to be selection by an impartial judge, Midori started off  towards a bar chosen at random, (there were several on the street),  and as soon as she entered it, Reito started moving.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Minoru  reached the town shortly after noon—scratch-ass had been right, the  walk wasn’t terribly long; no more than a half an hour—but his  back ached like <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">hell. </span></em>It had occurred to him more than once  to question why exactly he was being made to carry his rifle along  with him if he wasn’t going to be using it at all; indeed, it  seemed increasingly that this would be his first assignment in at  least a decade where he didn’t have to fire so much as a single  shot, and while he rather liked the prospect, he had to accept that  he wasn’t twenty anymore, and he really couldn’t hike this far  with fifty-odd pounds on his back like he could fifteen years ago.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Why </em>do <em>I put up with this assignment?  It’s certainly not for  the money—it’s not like I need any more of that in my lifetime. </em>Indeed, this was truer than it would be for most people in the  world: The Sino-Russian conflict alone had earned him more money in  two years than most people made in a lifetime.  He had embraced  several years ago the fact that the only reason he still whored his  gun out was because he had nothing else to do, and it made him feel  like maybe he wasn’t getting older after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Some  people would call that sick, but some people don’t understand the  way this profession works.  If I didn’t get hired to do a job,  somebody else would.  There’s plenty of us out there, and I’ve  got more discretion than most of them anyway. </em>He said this to  himself frequently.  Moreso lately.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe  the reason he didn’t just break contract and run was because he  wanted the relief, yes.  Or maybe it was something else.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Maybe  you just don’t want to admit that scratch-ass scares the piss out  of you. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Which  was absurd, since he’d only ever heard his voice over the phone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If  either of you dies, we’ll shoot the other.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe  it was the creepy ambiguity of the whole thing; but then again, he  usually didn’t meet his employers face to face. <em>But most of my  employers don’t talk like a middle-aged version of deep-throat,  either. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  shook his head, forcing himself back to the present before he  wandered into the street by accident and got himself run over in  quite possibly the most embarrassing way he could imagine, on the  worst day he’d had in quite some time.  He wanted to go out on a  good day, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He found  his way onto the main drag of this little tourist trap of a town; not  hard to do since the rest of it only encompassed a few square blocks  in the direction he’d come from.  He looked up, and almost by  accident, he discovered that maybe it wasn’t such a bad day after  all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">His mark  was twenty yards in front of him, and she was walking right into a  store that appeared to specialize in lingerie.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  figure could have just as easily been a shadow, but that concerned  none of the living.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What  concerned the figure was the man with the sniper rifle aimed at the  cabin.  He was patient, but so was the figure, who could wait as long  as was necessary to ascertain every detail of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or at  least, as long it took to convince the figure that the man needed to  die.  The figure’s knives were always sharp.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
There  were two facts of life that Shizuru Fujino seemed to be able to  ignore with a perfect fluidity:  The first was that Natsuki was, as  of late, only halfway comfortable with Shizuru’s company. The  second was that she was walking right into a lingerie shop with that  only halfway-comfortable girl.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nonetheless,  Natsuki, ever the “stuff it in” type, pushed her discomfort  aside.  A display of her discomfort, she knew, would only make the  situation worse.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  didn’t suppose that Shizuru would appreciate being referred to as a  situation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  store was more or less the same as the rest of the town—quaint and  yet inviting enough to make one want to spend (a lot of) money  there—with one major difference: Unlike the rest of the town, the  store sold lingerie.  As Natsuki was rapidly discovering, quaint  lingerie stores were really just log cabins with enough of a  repressed sexual undertone to make it feel, to her, like stepping  onto the set of a pornographic movie.  Once again, she pushed the  feeling aside with a measure of success and began browsing as she  always did, acting as though she was not browsing by moving brusquely  through the aisles like she was looking for something in particular.  (Though she felt she had lightened up considerably since the  destruction of the HiME star, Mai often insisted that she still  needed to stop being so serious all the time).</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  worked quite well for her as she quickly looked through the racks  full of panties and bras, aptly ignoring another undeniable fact of  life: That any store specializing in lingerie was bound to be  concerned primarily with the raunchier side of the garment.  She  would select four items and leave, as simple as that.  She rarely  indulged in the vaguely sexual glee that naturally accompanied  lingerie shopping, and never when others were around to see the color  in her cheeks as she did so.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  able to focus on this right up until Shizuru, who had wandered off  for a moment, appeared next to her, holding up what was quite  possibly the raunchiest set of panties she had ever seen:  They were  a deep, suggestive red, made entirely from lace so that they were  just barely transparent; the waist was small, the butt nonexistent.  Oh, and they were crotchless.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  had the most adorable grin on as she held them up for Natsuki to  observe.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you think, Natsuki?” Shizuru asked as though she couldn’t see  the deep blush invading Natsuki’s face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  could only stare.  Up until last year, her collection had consisted  entirely of plain white granny-panties and bras. Following the attack  of a particularly perverse Orphan, however, the entire collection was  destroyed and she was encouraged (by a certain brown-haired “friend,”  no less) to branch out a little as she rebuilt, to indulge her  “creativity” as she hadn’t done in the past.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For  Natsuki, however, creativity stopped at the color blue and a single  thong.  She didn’t even think something like this existed. She  could only gape and blush a crimson as deep as that…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shook her head.  Something very deep inside of her wanted that little  thing very, very badly.  The rest of her wanted it gone before she  had a meltdown.  A <em>big </em>meltdown.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the  midst of her shock, and maybe with a little help from the soft power  that Shizuru possessed, but rarely employed, Natsuki found herself  unable to resist as Shizuru guided her towards the dressing room.  She found her legs and Fujino’s moving in complete synchronization,  and she was utterly oblivious to the odd looks the shopkeepers were  giving her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  snapped out of this half-trance about five feet before what she was  suddenly certain was her imminent demise within the confines of a  dressing room.  She didn’t know what had put her there in the first  place, but she was convinced that she needed to leave <em>right. now. </em>before Shizuru did something like suggest that she</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go  on, try it on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  froze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Her  mouth wrapped around Natsuki’s breast, Shizuru whispers, “Go on,  try it on,” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  worry,” Shizuru gave her a soft grin.  “I’ll be out here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I-don’t-th-th-think,”  Natsuki was <em>stuttering. </em>Fear gripped her chest for the second  time this trip, and it seemed to affect her more than being shot at;  when she was being shot at, at least she knew what to do.  What  Shizuru was suggesting…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  not?” Shizuru asked like she wasn’t suggesting anything.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  isn’t really my…my kind of thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you talking about this,” Shizuru nodded at the panties, “or…”  She let it hang.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was silence between them for a moment, and suddenly Natsuki realized  that they were in a place where nobody could see them, a corner  blocked from view by a wall.  How had she let herself get here in the  first place?  She never locked up like that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The bell  attached to the front door rang, and the shopkeeper’s voice rang  out, “Hello, wel—um,” a shocked pause; it took the old lady a  moment to recover.  “Welcome to our shop, sir.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Sir? </em>Both of them froze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  worry about me, ma’am. I’m just here to pick up a replacement for  something of my girlfriend’s,” ‘sir’ said.  His voice was  calm, with a touch of dry humor to it, and smooth as a field of grass  blowing in the wind.  “She’s having her mother over, you see, and  she spilled miso all down her front.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  she had no other replacements with her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re  staying over at the lodge by the beach, and she had nothing left.  I  won’t be but a minute.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The old  lady’s voice was still suspicious, but she seemed a little more  accommodating.  “Alright, but don’t go near those changing rooms.   There are a pair of young ladies back there right now.”  He made a  noise of agreement.  “Also, you’ll have to leave your backpack at  the counter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright,  but I’d prefer you didn’t open it.  It’s rather private.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  shopkeeper’s voice was sharp.  “I wasn’t going to open it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,  sorry.  Just a habit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was a heavy metallic <em>thud,</em> and the old woman said, “Oi, what  do you have in there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like  I said,” the man said wryly, “private.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All  right, all right, go find whatever you’re looking for.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yessum,”  the man laughed a little, and, surprisingly, the woman laughed with  him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  relaxed a little, found Shizuru to be gazing into her eyes.  She  jumped a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Natsuki,”  Shizuru asked quietly. “Are you afraid of me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  question took her more off-guard than the gaze, and suddenly, she  couldn’t think of an answer to such a simple question.  Words like  “yes” and “no” seemed insufficient for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wouldn’t want to cause you any discomfort, Natsuki,” Shizuru  continued.  “But…I don’t want you to be…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shizuru,”  Natsuki said a bit awkwardly, “You’re not—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know I make you a little bit uncomfortable.  I know I have since I  did those things…those crazy things, without even thinking about  it, really.  I had hoped you could move past them, but if you’re  not ready to, then you should tell me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  didn’t know what to say to this, but Shizuru didn’t seem to be ready  for a response anyway.  “Because I don’t want to hurt you any  more than I already have.  But at the same time, I don’t want to  keep being hurt by you.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  I never get anything from you.  Never a yes, never a no. Never even a  maybe.  And I don’t know what to do about that, Natsuki.  I really  don’t.”  She spoke calmly, without so much as a tremble in her  voice.  At the same time, though, Natsuki could hear the girl’s  sincerity in the simplicity of her tone.  “And that causes me some  discomfort, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This hit  Natsuki harder than she’d thought it would; she felt like she’d  been slapped by this calm, neutral voice coming from this pretty,  cool-headed girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She  inhales.  I inhale.  She exhales.  I exhale.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  silence was thick.  Natsuki felt suddenly as though she was going to  choke on it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know why that is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She  inhales. I inhale.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She  exhales. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  love you, Natsuki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  exhale.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She’s  leaning in towards me.<br />
  I  can’t do this.<br />
  Her  breath tickles my cheek.<br />
  I  can’t do this.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><br />
  Her  lips are</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">warm<br />
  soft</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>moist. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  can’t. </em>Natsuki turned her head away, and Shizuru let out a  breath that could have been as much frustration as  it was disappointment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wish you would tell me to leave,” Shizuru murmured, “if that was  what you wanted.”<br />
      <em>I  don’t.</em><br />
  Natsuki  shook her head.  “I’m sorry, Shizuru. I’m not ready for  something like that. Not yet.  Not now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is  there somebody else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In a  moment of bitterness, Natsuki said, “Who else would there be,  Shizuru? There isn’t anybody.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  you haven’t forgotten about that yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, I  haven’t.  I can be around you and be all right, but I can’t…I  can’t trust you. Not really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  sighed.  “I’m sorry, then. I’m sorry for that.”<br />
      <em>Don’t  be.</em><br />
  She  turned and started to walk away.  “I’ll wait outside for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She’s  walking away. She’s leaving. </em>Fear greater even than before  gripped Natsuki’s chest like a vise. “Don’t—” but  it was too late.  She was gone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was gone and Natsuki was still there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  sighed, her head clearing as it always did after the<br />
      <em>Shizuru's<br />
    </em>pressure was off, and after a moment’s consideration, she tried the panties  on.</span></p>
