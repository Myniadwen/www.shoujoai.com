<h1>The Manga Reaction (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maihime/mangareaction-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Nao blinked as she read aloud, &quot;Open up my keyhole?!&quot;
Tossing down the script for volume two the redhead
growled, &quot;This makes me look like a complete slut!&quot;

&quot;Like that&#39;s new,&quot; Haruka muttered, the blonde pouring
over her own copy of the script, a spicy meat bun
beside her.

&quot;Bitch,&quot; Nao glared at her.

&quot;Don&#39;t call my Haruka that,&quot; Yukino said, the brown
haired young woman&#39;s glasses flashing as she frowned
at Nao.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you cute when you&#39;re fierce,&quot; Nao backed down
a bit while giving Yukino a much more thoughtful
look..

&quot;Besides,&quot; Haruka flipped through her own copy of the
script, &quot;I&#39;m less than pleased with how underhanded I
have to be.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Chie noted, the black haired girl sitting with
Aoi nearby. She smirked, &quot;At least I got the announcer
role for the big fight.&quot;

&quot;Our very own Don King?&quot; Reito chuckled.

&quot;She&#39;s much cuter,&quot; Aoi noted with a smile.

&quot;I was,&quot; Yukino blushed faintly as she said, &quot;really
impressed with how you summoned your childe, Haruka.&quot;

Haruka blushed. The scene in question involved a very
intimate hug between Haruka and Yukino, much closer
than what would have been really necessary just to
summon the childe. &quot;Yes, well...&quot; she trailed off.

&quot;Anything you want to confess to the rest of us?&quot; Nao
asked, her eyes twinkling as the others looked on with
interest.

&quot;Not to you,&quot; Haruka said flatly.

The door slid open and Mai strode inside, dragging a
smoking and battered Yuuichi behind her. &quot;We&#39;re back,&quot;
she called out.

&quot;Mai!&quot; Mikoto squealed, racing up to glomp her.

&quot;Thanks for lending me your sword,&quot; Mai hugged her,
&quot;it really came in handy cutting away all that fake
gold chain he was wearing.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome Mai,&quot; Mikoto snuggled up to her
breasts happily.

&quot;You make a good target,&quot; Natsuki added to Yuuichi as
she and Shizuru went in after them, &quot;but remember to
zig zag more.&quot;

&quot;Oh god...&quot; Yuuichi groaned in pain.

&quot;Big brother,&quot; Shiho raced over to his side and helped
the battered hero up. &quot;Wasn&#39;t this a bit much?&quot; she
asked.

&quot;You wanted him still doing the pimping thing?&quot;
Shizuru asked her sweetly while keeping a hand on
Natsuki&#39;s arm.

Shiho sighed, &quot;Point.&quot;

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Yuuichi sighed weakly as Shiho helped
drag him over to a chair, coincidentally right beside
where she was sitting.

&quot;Aspirin?&quot; Yohko asked, the older nurse giving him a
look that could almost be described as predatory.

&quot;Ah, no thanks,&quot; Yuuichi paled.

&quot;What&#39;s with her?&quot; Mai blinked.

&quot;With everyone chasing after Yuuichi, she might figure
she&#39;ll get more screen time if she&#39;s lusting after him
too?&quot; Natsuki guessed. She shrugged eloquently as she
added, &quot;Better her than me, anyway.&quot;

&quot;Here&#39;s the next script, Shizuru-sama,&quot; the little
redhead offered the documents to both Natsuki and her.

&quot;Arika?&quot; Natsuki frowned at her, &quot;What&#39;s a Otome scab
doing here?&quot;

Arika looked sheepish, &quot;It wasn&#39;t my fault I got
picked for that, ma&#39;am.&quot; She paused and dropped her
voice, &quot;Besides, I&#39;m readying myself.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot; Mai asked as she finally got Mikoto away
from her breasts.

&quot;I heard about the Otome manga,&quot; Arika sighed glumly
as she said, &quot;and the horror of... MANshiro. I figured
hanging with all of you might prepare me.&quot;

&quot;Poor thing,&quot; Nao said, shuddering slightly at the
idea. It was odd enough having Akira dressing as a
guy, the thought of a boy posing as Mashiro was
creepy.

&quot;Look at page 117,&quot; Aoi said, a impish little smile on
her face.

Flipping through the script Natsuki stopped, her eyes
widening as she read. &quot;Natsuki&#39;s already mine?&quot;
Natsuki pointed out a bit of script to Shizuru as she
added, &quot;Getting awfully possessive, aren&#39;t we?&quot;

Shizuru smoothly wrapped her arms around Natsuki as
she purred, &quot;Well, you are mine aren&#39;t you, Natsuki?&quot;

Natsuki blushed, &quot;Shizuru!&quot;

&quot;Mostly anyway,&quot; Shizuru nibbled her ear.

&quot;Would you two mind not doing that?&quot; Nao asked. &quot;I
think I&#39;m getting ill.&quot;

&quot;Well, I find it quite entertaining,&quot; Chie smirked,
using her camera-phone to record all of the action.

&quot;Hentai,&quot; Aoi smacked her gently.

Chie abandoned filming to give Aoi a sultry smile,
&quot;And you love me like that.&quot;

&quot;Mai, what does hentai mean?&quot; Mikoto asked innocently.

With a blush Mai answered, &quot;I&#39;ll explain it when
you&#39;re older.&quot;

Mikoto pouted, &quot;That&#39;s what you said when I asked
about cunningulis too.&quot;

You could have heard a pin drop as a silence descended
on the room. &quot;Something you&#39;re not telling us, Mai?&quot;
Reito asked, a slight frown on his face.

&quot;It&#39;s not quite what you think,&quot; Mai sighed, &quot;you see,
Mikoto found one of Natsuki&#39;s magazines and...&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; Natsuki quickly slapped a hand over Mai&#39;s
mouth.

&quot;And how did Natsuki&#39;s magazines end where Mikoto
could get to them?&quot; Aoi blinked.

&quot;Cause Natsuki&#39;s sleeping with us!&quot; Mikoto beamed.

&quot;What?&quot; Haruka blurted. &quot;Kuga, you&#39;re corrupting BOTH
of them?&quot;

&quot;I am not,&quot; Natsuki blushed.

&quot;Natsuki, what&#39;s this all about?&quot; Shizuru purred, eyes
twinkling dangerously.

&quot;Oh hell,&quot; Chie grabbed Aoi and hid under the table.

&quot;Shizuru...&quot; Natsuki started then sighed. &quot;I&#39;m using
their spare bed,&quot; she confessed, &quot;since Mikoto always
sleeps with Mai.&quot;

&quot;Always?&quot; Nao smirked.

&quot;Shhh,&quot; Yukino shushed her, wanting to hear more.

&quot;But why would you...?&quot; Shizuru looked perplexed.

&quot;I&#39;m tired of rooming alone,&quot; Natsuki admitted, &quot;and
with my best possible roommate in university, I
settled for second best.&quot;

&quot;Second best? Gee, thanks,&quot; Mai grumbled.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Natsuki,&quot; Shizuru&#39;s expression softened
further, &quot;I didn&#39;t realize you&#39;d be so lonely.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right, Shizuru,&quot; Natsuki said shyly.

&quot;I know,&quot; Shizuru brightened, &quot;maybe I can sneak you
into my university dorm room and we can...&quot;

Mai quickly covered Mikoto&#39;s ears. &quot;Mai, I wanna
hear,&quot; Mikoto complained as she struggled weakly.

Chie paused in making notes of some of the more
inventive ideas, &quot;It&#39;s certainly educational.&quot;

&quot;Chie,&quot; Aoi scolded.

To be continued...?

Notes: A bit of reaction to volume two of the manga,
mixed with general Hime wackiness. Some references to
the &#145;Directors cut&#39; final episode, including Natsuki
sleeping over at Mai &amp; Mikoto&#39;s.</pre>
