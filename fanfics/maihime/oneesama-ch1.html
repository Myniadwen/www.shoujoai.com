<h1>Oneesama (part 1 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maihime/index.html">Mai HiME</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/leebot.html">Leebot</a><br> </h2>
<p>Anh-oneesama</p><hr>Natsuki Kruger,
Gakuencho of Garderobe, was missing. Well, not officially, and not
against any rules, but in Shizuru’s mind, she still counted as
missing. She’d arranged with the First Column, Sarah Gallagher, to
have her fill in for the rest of the day, and she’d made sure to
complete any duties that required her personally the previous day.
With everything set up, she’d disappeared. But she was still
considered missing for the simple reason that she’d said not a word
of what she was doing to Shizuru.</p><p>It was completely
unlike Natsuki, to say the least – all the more so given how she’d
been acting since Shizuru had been cured of her petrification.
Shizuru had never before seen the normally-withdrawn Gakuencho be so
clingy – save perhaps in the immediate aftermath of lovemaking or
in her sleep. Natsuki seemed to be making an effort to be in the same
room as Shizuru whenever possible, and whenever they had a moment
alone, she was sure to show her affection with a tender hug or kiss.</p><p>It was really 
touching
to see how much her absence had affected Natsuki, if a bit
heartbreaking to know the pain she must have been going through.
Although it had been many painful days for Natsuki, the whole
incident had lasted only a moment for Shizuru. One second she was
investigating a crater caused by Thron 1 and received a warning from
a petrified Miyu, and an attack by a shadowy presence later, she was
slumped over in the infirmary, completely exhausted.</p><p>Fortunately for her
peace of mind, it only took Natsuki five seconds from realizing they
were cured before she had Shizuru in her arms. She was still
completely clueless as to what had happened, but the jubilation all
around her let her know that things were alright, at least. She was
put off a bit when Natsuki started openly crying in their embrace,
concerned for her girlfriend’s image, but no one seemed to mind –
especially when Haruka was making a much bigger deal about demanding
to know all that had happened while simultaneously trying to pay
attention to her own girlfriend’s need to feel her presence again.
Even Nao and Miss Maria held their tongues at the scene.</p><p>Things calmed down
eventually, though, and Natsuki was able to take some private time
with Shizuru to explain all that had happened. Her change in attitude
was left mostly unsaid, but only because she’d decided to show it
to Shizuru rather than simply telling her. She didn’t really need
to speak the words, though, for Shizuru to understand. They’d been
with each other for so long they could practically read each other’s
minds.</p><p>Not now, though.
Natsuki’s departure had taken Shizuru completely by surprise. She’d
simply returned from a routine meeting with Queen Mashiro to find
that Natsuki had departed. Even though Shizuru regularly filled in
for Natsuki under normal circumstances, for some reason Natsuki had
asked Sara to fill in instead. It was almost as if Natsuki made that
choice specifically so she wouldn’t have to inform Shizuru that she
was leaving.</p><p>As for why she’d
left, Sara wasn’t given any reason. There wasn’t any emergency
taking place, or Shizuru would certainly have been informed of it,
and no one she’d talked to had had any other ideas. She hadn’t
been this baffled by Natsuki for years. Then again, that last
instance of complete befuddlement had had quite good consequences in
the end. Perhaps she’d just have to trust Natsuki to make it
worthwhile this time as well.</p><hr>I owe a lot of who I
was back in Garderobe to my Oneesama, Anh Lu. Most of it was good,
but I did pick up a few bad traits from her as well. An outsider
looking at all the influence she had on me would likely say that
overall she was quite a blessing. The problem is, they wouldn’t
know just what the bad traits I picked up from her nearly cost me. I
was truly lucky things turned out as they did. If things had gone
just a little differently, I’d be a much worse person today, and
I’d never know what I was missing.</p><p>When I first entered
Garderobe, I was a hopelessly naïve city girl. My family was
extraordinarily well-off, which unfortunately left me horribly
unprepared for life at Garderobe. I went from having a fleet of maids
at my command to training to be one. At least, that was how it seemed
my first few weeks there. Instead of noble warriors, I started to see
Otome as glorified maids. That view didn’t last long, though. It
was simply childish spite at being forced into hard labor for the
first time in my life.</p><p>I wasn’t the only one
having problems adjusting to the lifestyle. Most of the girls there
came from rich families, and so they were facing the same problems
that I was. In the minority were the girls who’d won scholarships
or grants for their education. Not only were these girls more often
lower-class and thus better prepared for the work involved, but the
fact that they’d earned their tuition meant that they were already
quite extraordinary.</p><p>While, outside of
Garderobe, we might have looked down on these girls, all class
divisions were stripped away within the school. Thanks to the little
selection bias in their favor, they jumped to the top of the class.
We were suddenly all competing to keep up with them. They were lesser
idols during our first weeks at school. Of course, our real idols
were the second-year students, the Pearls. They’d already been
through all of this, and they knew just what we were going through in
adjusting.</p><p>The most idolized of
the Pearls were the top three, the Trias. But of them, the
top-ranking Pearl, Anh Lu, easily overshadowed the other two. Anh was
the perfect idol for every student at Garderobe. She was dignified,
beautiful, and fierce in battle. Her personality also leant itself
well to idolatry. She was perfect at giving all of her fans just a
moment of personal attention when she was swarmed, and she somehow
made everyone feel like they were special to her.</p><p>We soon learned that,
before long, the Pearls would each be selecting one or two Corals –
us first year students – to be their “heya-gakkari.” A
heya-gakkari served as the Pearl’s personal attendant, and did
whatever chores were asked of her. In return, the Pearl would help
tutor the heya-gakkari, both in academics and in combat. Everyone
competed to gain the attention of the upper Pearls, hoping to get one
of the best to help them out.</p><p>Now, with a situation
like the heya-gakkari system, human nature tends to take over. Since
the heya-gakkari was obligated to do whatever her Oneesama asked of
her, a few students took advantage of this to fill their baser
desires. It was well-known around Garderobe that this went on, but
few really minded it. With all of the idolatry of the Pearls that
went on, many girls actually hoped that their beloved Oneesama would
request such favors from them.</p><p>It’s not that
Garderobe was filled entirely with lesbians, of course. It was simply
that being an Otome limited our options. We were surrounded entirely
by other girls at the time we were first maturing, and we also knew
that we could never have sex with a man until we retired. With all
the exploration and discovery that goes on at that age, it would be
more surprising if this behavior weren’t so common.</p><p>It was during my first
couple months at Garderobe that I really discovered myself. I joined
in with many of my friends in idolizing our “Anh-oneesama.” I was
practically in love with her. When sexual urges started to crop up
within me, I soon realized that I was one of the lucky few who truly
desired girls. I started to dream of falling in love with Anh and
developing a relationship with her. In my fantasies, we didn’t even
have to end it after we left Garderobe, as happened with most
relationships between students.</p><p>With such a desirable
dream in mind, I set myself out to earn her attention so I could be
her heya-gakkari. I devoted myself entirely to my studies and
practice. I shot ahead of all the other Corals, and when the first
rankings came out, I was on top. In second place was my roommate,
Haruka Armitage, who’d been fully expecting to come out on top
herself. From that point on, she declared herself my rival, and she
fought with me for every honor at Garderobe – including Anh’s
attention.</p><p>Fortunately for my
sake, Haruka’s exuberance far outstripped her common sense. Her
idea of getting Anh to notice her involved smuggling a load of beer
into Garderobe and offering to share it with her and some of Anh’s
other fan girls – myself not included among them, naturally. Though
given that she’d decided to throw this little party in our room,
she probably wouldn’t have been able to refuse me if I’d asked
without losing face.</p><p>Nevertheless, I decided
to simply attempt to occupy myself with homework while the party went
on around me (and quickly spilled out into the hall). I was hoping
that I could impress Anh with my studiousness in the face of
debauchery. Back then, I’d fallen for her public image and thought
of her as someone perfectly prim and proper, who’d just decided to
attend this event to keep it from getting out of control. I was
wrong.</p><p>Haruka’s plan went to
hell thanks to a couple facets of Anh’s personality which she’d
carefully hidden behind her façade. It wasn’t her fault,
really. There was no way any of us could have predicted what would
have happened. The first problem was that Anh was (and still is)
completely incapable of holding her alcohol. She normally avoids it,
but she gives into temptation far too often for her own good – or
for the good of anyone around her, for that matter.</p><p>This wouldn’t have
been so bad if it weren’t for the other problem with Anh:
Uninhibited, she’s a complete lech. It isn’t uncommon for girls
to become more sexual when inebriated, but Anh is something else. She
isn’t just willing to accept any offers that might come her way;
she simply sees what she wants and takes it. She also seems to get
the idea in her head that everyone else is going to be just as
enthusiastic as her.</p><p>There’s only one
saving grace to Anh’s lecherousness: She believes firmly that an
Otome must remain a virgin. She extends this to relations between
women as well, even though there’s no proscription against it like
there is when it comes to relations with men. I wasn’t about to
argue with her on this point, though. If it weren’t for this
particular belief, Anh would have crossed the line from molester to
rapist, and I could well have been one of her victims.</p><p>Well, everything came
out into the open that night. When the other girls were only just
starting to feel the effects of inebriation, Anh lost it. The first
sign that something was wrong was when she started to ask Haruka some
rather inappropriate questions. The poor girl was quizzed on her
sexual preferences first, and when she reluctantly admitted that she
was into girls to get Anh to stop pestering her, Anh then just
proceeded to ask her if she was involved, or, if not, maybe a bit
interested in something.</p><p>For a moment there, I
simply enjoyed the scene. Haruka was quite amusing when she was
flustered like that, and it was also quite refreshing to see her
cowering under the predatory Anh. My amusement wasn’t to last,
though, as Anh’s behavior started to get more worrying. She
suddenly backed off from Haruka and started to complain about the
heat in the room – which was currently quite pleasant. As a logical
extension of this, she then proceeded to start stripping off her
uniform.</p><p>When she was down to
her underwear with no relief, she got the idea that it was simply our
room which was hot, and she ran out into hall to get some relief. A
stunned wave of fangirls followed her out, while those who’d
started off in the hall were met with the remarkable sight of a
nearly-naked and flushed Anh. It was fortunate for her that all of
those girls had dreamed of such a sight for so long that they didn’t
have a chance to think overmuch on it. They simply stood and swooned,
privately imagining that Anh had done this just for their benefit,
possibly as a little thanks for the party.</p><p>“Aren’t you all hot
as well?” Ahn then asked. The words sent an alert through my mind.
My head flashed with images of Anh going on a rampage through the
hallway, forcefully tearing off the clothing of everyone in sight. I
ran from my desk to the doorway, my instincts pushing me to try to
prevent the imminent disaster. Unfortunately, my sudden appearance
just ended up grabbing Anh’s attention. “Shizuru-chan! You must
be so hot staying in that stuffy room! Please, let me help you out…”</p><p>I barely had time 
to
let an expression of worry cross my face before Anh was on me. To
this day, I don’t know how she managed it, but she was able to get
the top of my uniform off in a matter of seconds, even against my
resistance. At that point, my conscious mind abandoned me, and I
panicked. I fell back into the room as Anh pressed in on me, now
working on the lower half of my uniform. It was all I could do to
throw the door shut behind us before she pushed me to the floor.</p><p>The struggle that
ensued wasn’t pretty – at least from my perspective; I’m sure<i>some</i> out there would 
have found it quite the sight. Anyways,
Anh was able to get the rest of my uniform off, while somehow I also
ended up removing her bra – or perhaps she simply did that herself.
Fortunately, panicked knocking on the door and Haruka’s yells
interrupted us before things could go any further.</p><p>A moment of clarity
seemed to hit Anh at that moment, and I was able to slip out while
she was stunned. I got to the door and opened it a crack, being
careful to hide the state of my body. “Anh-oneesama seems to be
suffering from heatstroke,” I explained to the enraged Haruka and
other girls outside. “She really isn’t feeling right, so I think
it’s probably best if you leave her to me for tonight.”</p><p>I was able to keep my
voice steady as I said this – but only barely. The feeling of
having my bra unhooked from behind in the middle of my sentence was
quite distracting, but I don’t believe anyone noticed. I said all
of this in the hope of simply preserving Anh’s dignity. I knew that
Haruka, at least, would have figured out what was really going on. I
tried to get across to her in my expression that if she didn’t want
to get into deep trouble for starting all of this, she’d simply
play along and hopefully also disperse the girls outside.</p><p>From an expression of
fear that appeared in Haruka’s face, I knew she got it, so I
quickly closed the door. It was just in time, apparently, as my bra
was on the floor only a second later. Soon enough, Anh had me pinned
to my bed and was eying me hungrily. For a moment there, I succumbed
to temptation and allowed myself to peer down at her bared breasts.
Embarrassment taking over me, I soon snapped my gaze back up to her
face, where I caught her doing the same to me.</p><p>To put it lightly, I
did <i>not</i> like her expression. She looked ready to consume me.
Quite honestly, I was frightened of what she might do to me. I’d
never given much thought to doing things like this before. I’d
fantasized about Anh, but it was more about the romantic, rather than
sexual, side of things. I could feel my dreams shattering and being
replaced by a nightmare. I didn’t know about her limits then, and
so I was fearing for the sake of my virginity. I even started crying
softly as my fear grew.</p><p>It was at that sight
that Anh finally sobered up. I found myself in a tight hug as she
tried desperately to console me and ask forgiveness for her actions.
Relieved to be safe and content to blame everything on the beer, I
obliged her. The two of us shyly put our uniforms back on as she
continually thanked me for saving her from embarrassment and again
asked for forgiveness for her actions.</p><p>Anh explained to me
then about what alcohol did to her and reassured me that she would
never go all the way, even though she might press the limits at
times. She’d gotten away with it in the past because most of her
fangirls had been more than happy to oblige her desires. Surrounded
mostly by girls she thought would be like this, she’d allowed
herself to give into temptation and imbibe in alcohol for a night of
relaxation and fun.</p><p>She’d assumed I was
simply another fangirl who wanted her like that, which was why she’d
gone after me as she did. My fear, however, was a splash of cold
water to her. Not only was she ashamed of what she’d almost done to
me, but she was also ashamed of how she’d looked in front of the
other girls. She started to imagine them all reacting like I did to
her display. I tried to reassure her that a lot of them had probably
simply enjoyed the sight, and that I was simply the exception. It
probably wasn’t the best way to handle the situation, but it seemed
to settle her down a bit.</p><p>All in all, I’m
pretty proud of the way I handled myself that night. I know I wasn’t
a very elegant picture cowering in fear from what she might do to me,
but it’s the fact that I resisted falling for her that I’m proud
of. I held strong to my convictions about how inappropriate her
behavior was, and I was even able to break through her drunken haze
to convince her of this.</p><p>Sadly, though, that was
the high point for my convictions. If I’d kept working at that
level, perhaps I would have been able to affect a more permanent
change in Anh’s behavior and attitudes. As it was, though, the
changes I saw in her were short-lived. She picked me as her
heya-gakkari not long after this incident, saying that she respected
my strength of character. She told me that she would work with me to
strengthen it even further over the next year. What this
unfortunately meant was that she pressed my limits at every
opportunity to force me to toughen up in my rebuffing of her.</p><p>I did get better at
hiding my emotions from these experiences, but in the end, I didn’t
handle things properly with her. Looking back, I think the best thing
I could have done was to take a firm stand with her and make it clear
that even the slightest advances were inappropriate. Instead, I came
to enjoy them. Her lecherousness infected me. Instead of fighting her
off, I put up an air of it simply not bothering me. This allowed me
to both enjoy her touches and keep my dignity. Before I knew it, Anh
had transformed me into a younger version of herself: A perfect lady
on the outside, a complete pervert on the inside.</p><p>If the younger version
of me from when I’d just entered Garderobe had come across that
older version, she would have been rightfully repulsed. I’d lost
myself in the mask I put up for the world. I convinced myself that
acting as an idol like that was what I truly wanted, and that I could
be fulfilled with the shallow relationships I formed with my
fangirls. I treated them all simply as means to an end, ways to
fulfill my own personal desires. When I neared graduation, I dreamed
of finding a cute young Coral and making her my own, for whatever I
might wish to do with her.</p><p>Yes, sadly, at that
point, the romantic in me had been deeply buried. I no longer dreamed
of my first time being with someone I was deeply in love with.
Instead, I wanted it to be a fangirl who was obligated to obey my
every perverted command. It’s hard just thinking about the person I
was back then, and I shudder to imagine who I might have grown into
had I not been saved by the very girl I’d once hoped to dominate.</p><p>Her name was Natsuki
Kruger. I met her my first day as a Pearl, along with all of the
other new Corals. I didn’t think of her as much beyond one of my
many fans at first. She was certainly cute, though, and perhaps the
cutest of the bunch. She stood out from most of the others
skill-wise, too, with only her roommate, Mai Tokiha, giving her any
decent competition.</p><p>Natsuki put on a mask
of her own back in those days. Like many of us, she’d been raised
in a well-off family. She bore a grace well beyond her years, which
would serve her well as an Otome, but she was still a child at heart
and had trouble applying her grace properly. She wore her particular
mask a bit too well, and a lot of her development in her first year
involved her roommate breaking it down to help let out her true self.</p><p>One thing that 
came out
when Natsuki’s true self slipped out was that she’d fallen for
me. I thought then that it was just like with my other fangirls, but
I really should have known better. Much like myself with Anh the
prior year, Natsuki was anything but a typical fan who just wanted me
for my mask and my body. She wanted me for me – the core of my
personality that I’d buried deep within me. I don’t think she
really saw anything of that person back then, but she imagined that
she did and fell in love with it.</p><p>Of course, I realized
none of this at the time. Her feelings were just those of another fan
to me. All that really mattered was that I found her to be both one
of the cutest girls of the younger class and one of the most skilled.
And so when she shyly – and so adorably – approached me in the
cafeteria one day to ask if she could be my heya-gakkari, I was
pleased to accept her. By my own shallow standards, she was quite
simply the best.</p><p>All that was left was
to seal the deal. I brought my hand up to trail my fingers lightly
back and forth across Natsuki’s chest as I said to myself, as if in
thought, “Ara, well Natsuki-chan certainly is quite pretty, and
she’s quite skilled as an Otome, too. She certainly meets my
standards there. There’s just one last thing I’ll need to make
sure she’s skilled enough at…”</p><p>I saw the nervousness
in Natsuki’s eyes as I looked down at her, and the faint blush that
was appearing in her cheeks. All I could think of was how cute it
made her look. It didn’t occur to me that she might not want this –
I knew full well that all my other fangirls did, and I’d grouped
her in with them. I figured she was just nervous about finally
getting what she’d longed for for so long.</p><p>I dropped my hand down
to cup her breast. As it slowly started to squeeze down on her, I
leaned my head down to capture her lips in a kiss. She would be the
first fangirl I’d ever given this pleasure to. I’d never even
allowed Anh to take my first kiss from me. Natsuki was indeed quite
lucky, I thought.</p><p>“No!” A
high-pitched shriek tore through my ears while a hand fiercely struck
my cheek. The pain froze me in the moment. I held my cheek, stunned,
as my world started to shatter before me.</p>
