<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s  notes:</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To be  honest, I hadn’t intended this to be a shiznat originally, but the  more I research it and pay attention to the subtle tells in Mai-HiME,  the more it fascinates me.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Also, I’m  under the impression that Reito graduated at the end of Mai-HiME.  If  I’m wrong about this, could somebody tell me about it?  Thanks!</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So here it  goes / This is my letter (to you)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Unfortunately  for the man in black, he was only afforded about six hours of rest  (in an admittedly fancy hotel) between the time his assignment  pointing guns at girls in vans ended and the time the phone rang.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  man in black woke up very slowly, but picked the phone up very  quickly, an old habit, one that had lost him a contract or two back  on the road.  “Yeah? It’s me.” He had rehearsed this a long  time ago, during what he dubbed his lazy years—the period of unrest  within the Middle East and the recent group of Sino-Russian  skirmishes.  Times when contracts came really easily, and they were  all the same: “Kill the generic leader figure while he’s up  giving a generic rousing speech to demoralize the generic enemy  troops.”  All he really needed was a location, which they usually  uploaded to his palm pilot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  voice was the same as it had been before: Scratchy and clipped.  A  voice that had better things to do than talk to some impudent sniper. <em>Asshole. </em>“You will meet with your partner at the location  we are transmitting to you.  Bring your equipment and food for a  stakeout.  If either one of you dies, we will shoot the other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Click,  and that was it. <em>If either of you dies, we’ll shoot the other. </em>This was unusual for him, but then, this was an unusual job.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s  because this is a low-risk assignment.  I saw kids in that car; if  one of us dies, it’s because the other one shot him; obviously,  scratch-ass on the other end of the phone and the bank account wants  to make sure none of us turn tail and split with his cash.  He sounds  like the kind of scratchy-ass that has the cash to make good on it,  too.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  man in black hoisted himself out of bed and scratched his own ass,  half for the poetic justice of the whole thing and half because it  itched.  He supposed he had time for a shower.  Besides, it had been  forever since he’d worked with a partner, and god damn if he wasn’t  going to make a good impression.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Besides,  if it was like any other stakeout, it would be the last shower he’d  take in several days.  He sniffed at his pits, and realized that he  could barely stand himself as it was; he supposed by the time the  stakeout was over, his stench alone could summon devils, the angry  kind shouting at him to give back their brimstone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  stripped off his black one-piecer and threw it on the plush bed,  walked naked to the fancy bathroom with the spit-shined pearl-colored  tile, stepped into the spacious, gold-rimmed shower, and turned on  the tap, which took forever to warm up just like it did in every  other goddamned hotel on the planet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He stood  in the cold spray anyway, mind filled with a bunch of half-images,  like photograph negatives.  He didn’t hear his wi-fi palm pilot  beep, informing him that he had New Messages, nor did he see that it  helpfully asked him, Would You Like to Read or Ignore?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If he’d  had his way, he’d probably have hit ‘ignore.’</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Mai sat  up, not unable to sleep but certainly possessing no desire to rest;  she felt that she wasn’t finished yet with the day, even though the  day was almost finished with her.  She knew what she had to do, too.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But why?  Why do it at all? She felt as though this specific thing, this thing  she did with Tate almost nightly, was something best left for school;  best left for a time when she wasn’t crammed in with eight other  girls, several of whom, <em>(Chie)</em> though  she had no desire to name names, were extremely nosy.  What would  they say if they found her doing this? Would they call her a letch? A  weirdo?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or even  worse, would they call her a hopeless romantic?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  already up.  She hadn’t even realized it.  She had to shake Mikoto  off of her, but the girl didn’t even stir.  They were still  roommates, Mai still having a year to go at Fuka Gakuen before she  graduated, and sleeping together had become so ingrained in their  routines that they slept far more soundly—completely so, in  fact—than any two people sleeping together should.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Why did  she even bother, though? She wanted to sit back down and go back to  sleep, suddenly.  Nothing was ever accomplished.  She was like a fish  swimming against a river of her own<br />
      <em>cowardace</em><br />
  inhibition; unless something altered the current, nothing could ever  change.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  wasn’t that for the best? Wasn’t that the least painful for…well,  for Tate and Shiho?  Sure, he participated in their little ritual  every night, but she was almost certain that he was torn between her  and Shiho.  After all, that little girl clung onto him like a  dustbunny clung to a balloon, but <em>he let her. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  let her do it.  He could push her away, but he didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked over at Shiho, grabbed her phone out of her bag without  intending to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  were nine girls in the room, and with one exception, they all slept  in even rows of three, their sleeping bags stretched out like slashes  on a prison wall, counting the years away:  Chie, Aoi, and Akane;  Mai, Mikoto (who hardly counted), and Midori; and Shizuru and  Natsuki.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  there was Shiho, who slept apart from the rows, in a corner.  By  herself. <em>She looks so…lonely.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  why shouldn’t she be? She’s vicious, cruel, and stubborn. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  lonely. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She’s  conniving! </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  lonely.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mean!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  lonely.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then, unbidden, certainly unintentional: <em>Tate is so…kind. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  can’t keep doing this to him.  You have your time, and it’s now.  This is the changing of the current.  You can get away any time you  want.  You could ask him to leave with you, right now, and he might.  He might just.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  knew she was right.  It was enough for a start.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Tate  slept as fitfully as he ever did.  Unbeknownst even to his former  roommate, Tate was a closet insomniac, and had been ever since Shiho  had had her “accident.”  He usually slept more or less through  the night, but it was unrestful, often only a half-sleep.  He only  got about three hours of “real” sleep per night, which meant that  he ran on adrenaline most of the day.  This was good, because it  encouraged a lack of coherent thought, which he needed right now.  Saying nothing of the quick temper and lack of short-term memory, it  actually worked out fairly well for him.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Except  during the night.  At night, he had to pretend that he wasn’t an  insomniac; had to feign sleep so that his roommate wouldn’t ask why  he never slept.  Come nighttime, he would go through the motions,  just as had here, of preparing for sleep, but instead of dropping off  after a half hour, as Reito could, he would simply stare at his  pillow, at the floor, at the ceiling, and think. Come nighttime, his  brain kicked in again, in a way it couldn’t during the daytime, and  he was subject to his thoughts for four solid hours, condemned by his  fear of being worried over to spend his nocturnal waking hours in  what he could honestly describe as a hell of his own invention.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not that  his thoughts were all entirely negative, nor that even half of them  were.  What was so torturous about the whole experience was the  sheer…scale of it all.  Everything that he had thought about during  the day, or rather, everything that he would have thought about were  he gifted with coherent thought as his peers were, seemed to come  rushing back to smack him in the face as soon as he closed his eyes  and turned out the lights.  A lot of it was inane, stupid, useless,  and he was able to discard it as he would during the day; but a lot  of it wasn’t, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  supposed that was because a lot of it had to do with Mai.  Taken in  little doses of disappointment, it wasn’t so bad: Mai smiling as  they passed in a hallway but not saying anything because of the  pink-haired thing latched onto his arm; the two of them sitting so  close in class, but unable to reach out and connect because of the  other thirty kids in their way; Mai, calling him from her dorm,  almost every night without fail.  Mai, saying nothing on that open  phone line, simply listening to him breathe, too frightened, or  perhaps too reserved for anything more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">His  phone was buzzing and he didn’t even realize it.  He grimaced,  quietly stood from his sleeping bag, (faking grogginess still escaped  him) and exited the room, went to lean against the wall that  separated the girls’ abode from his.  He took a quick peek at the  caller.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mai  Tokiha, </em>it said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">His  stomach dropped as he thought of the agreement he and Reito had made. <em>But, if I’m not talking to her, it doesn’t count, does it? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  flipped the phone open and put it to his ear, the cold plastic making  his ear prickle a little.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello,”  he said.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Hello,”  Tate said. It was no longer a question as it had been when she had  started calling him like this.  At first, Mai was certain she had  really intended to say something; her problem was that she never knew  what to say.  She didn’t want to be inappropriate, but…weren’t  relationships inappropriate by their very nature? Looking at Kazu and  Akane, she wouldn’t have thought so, but she understood that she  knew nothing of what they did in private, either.  For all she knew,  they had already eloped.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As she  thought about this and heard an exhalation from Tate settle into the  phone, a thought of the boy eloping with her rose to the top of her  head, and a healthy blush broke out on her cheeks.  She settled  against the wall that separated the boys’ abode from hers, and  Tate’s breathing began to fill her ears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She had  never said anything to him.  Never.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Because  of that<br />
      <em>bitch</em><br />
  girl? <em>(She shook her head, remembering what she’d thought earlier: </em>Lonely.Because of everyone else?  Because she wasn’t  honestly sure that she was<br />
  <em>not a  coward</em><br />
  ready  for a relationship? If she had really wanted to, she could have asked  him to sneak out after-hours and meet her, and they could have<br />
  <em>eloped</em><br />
  been  by themselves for a while.  Done what they had been unable to do  during the daylight.  She knew he didn’t sleep much; she had called  him at some very odd hours, and he had never sounded even the  slightest bit groggy when he answered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>He  inhales.  She inhales.  He exhales.  She exhales. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  current changes out here</em>.  She didn’t know where he was right  now, but unless he was out on a walk, he was less than twenty meters  from her in any direction.  He could sneak out without anybody  noticing.  All she had to do was say something.  Three words; <em>lets  go out</em>…or a few more choice, more intimate words…and that  would be it.  Maybe nobody would ever even know.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Or maybe  she wouldn’t care if they did.  She felt resolve creep back into  her throat, she felt the image of Shiho, who was just…<em>lonely</em>…back  into her eyes.  Maybe she would feel differently tomorrow, when she’d  rested, but for now…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  opened her mouth.  She could do it.  She was not a coward.  She was  not a coward. She was not a coward. <em>I am not a coward. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  throat worked for a moment, and she made a small, incoherent noise.  She thought of something that Shiho had said to her, one of the few  things she had ever said to her, about a month after the HiME star  had disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What  do you even like about him, anyway? </em>In the logic of a child who  had placed her claim on the boy, Mai was sure it made perfect sense,  even if she knew she could have turned the question right back on the  girl.  She hadn’t, of course.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But even  so…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  like the way he doesn’t wish me luck when he’s being sincere.  I  like the way he thinks…no, he </em>knows <em>I can take care of  myself. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Le…”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Tate’s  eyes widened in alarm and his heart seized up in his chest, and  suddenly, he was both very anxious and very tired.  He felt sleep  begin to creep up on him, and he shook it away, cursing his body for  being, for lack of a better description, fucking stupid.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He was  breathing more heavily now, but he didn’t dare speak.  In fact, his  jaw was clamped shut, so he couldn’t have spoken had he wanted to.  But right now, talking was the last thing he wanted to do.  He wanted <em>her </em>to speak.  He said “hello” and “goodbye” to her  when she called like this; he supposed he was well within his rights  to be a little resentful that she didn’t say anything to <em>him</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But he  wasn’t.  He was just tired all over. He had to brace himself  against the wall with his fist, which was rapidly, painfully curling  into itself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Please  say something, Mai.</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  like the way he grins when he thinks he’s got me by my tail.   I  like the way he still grins when it turns out he doesn’t. </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  had been a song Takumi had sent her on a CD from the hospital in  America; she didn’t know the name of the song or the band, but it  had left a profound impression on her.  She could sing it as well as  she could sing <em>Route 66; </em>which was so-so, at best, but even  so...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  thought about how good she felt when she sang karaoke.  When she <em>sang, </em>in general.  Music had a power no writer or painter had  ever been able to imitate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  thought about how good she felt when he smiled when she sang karaoke.   When he felt her power. She wasn’t ready yet, and that was okay  with her.  She could do this instead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Letter.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  heard his breath catch, and then there was silence for a moment.  Something cracked in the house, and she jumped; it took her a moment  to settle herself down. <em>Only the house settling. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  gathered that resolve back up.  “Here it goes,” she sang quietly,  imitating the English as well as she could, “this is my letter.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
She was <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">singing. </span></em>It was barely audible, but she was <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">singing. </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He loved  it when she sang.  Suddenly, the powerful, intense disappointment  that had made him lose control and pound the wall vanished, and he  found his attention entirely settled on that voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>On  that voice.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hope  you’re all right…it’s been rough for me.”  Her voice was soft  and mournful, and that was a cheery way of describing it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thinking  all night about the place I’d be,” this was him to a tee.  He  felt his throat lock up, and was very glad, suddenly, of his silence.   Her next line, though, was as strained as his voice would have been;  this surprised him a little, too.  “If I maybe just did a little  bit more you might have let me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  stopped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  might have let me what?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  might have let me love you?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  might have let me be with you?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  nagged at him the way little things did on very little sleep.  A lot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then,  silence. <em>What is it?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then,  a giggle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  snapped.  “What?” he whisper-shouted.  “You might have let me  what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another  giggle, and then another sniff, and she started singing again.  “If  I maybe just did a little bit more…you might have let me become a  man for sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  popped in his head.  Maybe it was a piece of his sanity. The two  of them dissolved into giggles, as quietly as they could, sinking  into the wall and wiping at their eyes, glad that nobody could see  them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They sat  there for a long time afterward, listening to each other breathe, and  he felt that even if they were dating, or –<em>perish the thought—</em>an  old, married couple, that at this moment, they would be doing exactly  the same thing that they were doing now.  He felt perfectly, wholly  content.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oddly  enough, so did she.  They went to sleep that way, and while Tate woke  up much earlier than she did, neither of them woke until morning.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Author’s End Note:
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I guess that was  a little corny, huh? That’s kind of how I envision their  relationship playing out up to this point, and the phone thing is of  my own invention, a little bit of romantic flare on my part.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My apologies if  it's not as good as the first two chapters though ;; no shiznat  here.  There are going to be multiple relationships for me to  build on, plus the whole &quot;plot&quot; thing.</span></p>
