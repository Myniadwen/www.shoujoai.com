<p>An Angel’s  Chaos</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“They’ve got the  whole school surrounded! The guys in 3-C say that the Executive  Director is trying to fight them off by herself, and they’ve got  guns and tanks!”
<p>“Mr. Kinjo, get back  to your classroom this instant!”</p>
<p>The boy swiftly  disappeared after the warning, but that didn’t stop the entire  class from bursting into hushed conversation as our teacher  desperately tried to calm everyone down. I spared a glance over at  Reito a few rows over and he returned the look, both of us equally  concerned, but not showing it in the least.</p>
<p><em>I wonder if this has  something to do with what happened last night…</em></p>
<p>Everyone knew about the  destruction of the bridge connecting Fuuka to the mainland, it was  the only discussion that had taken place this morning all around  campus. I myself had seen the brilliant burst of light that disrupted  the darkened sky on my way home from the festival, but at the time I  wasn’t aware that it had been the bridge that had been hit.</p>
<p>Why would the army come  here though? Was it some kind of precautionary measure?</p>
<p>Before I could ponder  any further, heavy footsteps were heard marching down the hall, and  moments later, a small group of soldiers decked in full uniform and  artillery entered the room. Needless to say, that shut everyone up  very quickly. What I found odd, however, was that they silently  approached our teacher, simply flashing something at him to look  over.</p>
<p>Oonishi-sensei appeared  to be horribly nervous, and proved it as he shook his head, “I-I-I’m  s-sorry…Th-They’re n-not in this c-class…”</p>
<p><em>They? What…?</em></p>
<p>Again without a word,  the soldiers left, and everyone seemed to sigh in relief, or at least  they did until one of the men stopped, slammed the door shut and  remained outside of the room, obviously stationed to keep us inside.</p>
<p>About an hour passed  like this. Silently we waited, simply staying in our seats as the  minutes ticked by. It became quickly obvious that all forms of  communication had been jammed, undoubtedly by this mysterious army,  so any attempted calls in or out of the school, and probably Fuuka as  a whole, were futile.</p>
<p>Eventually our silence  was shattered when muffled voices were heard outside the door, a  short discussion taking place before it slid open and another pair of  soldiers entered. This time one was obviously a woman considering the  fact that she was a lot shorter than her blonde counterpart who held  his helmet in his hand. Rather than addressing our teacher, the two  instantly turned to the rest of us.</p>
<p>“We’re looking for  the Student Council President and Vice President. We were told that  they were in this classroom. Don’t worry, we only wish to speak  with you.”</p>
<p><em>What exactly are  they expecting from us? They’ll find us out eventually…best to  just cooperate now and get on their good side.</em></p>
<p>Calmly, I stood from my  seat, all eyes instantly locking onto me, “If you are looking for  the Seitokaichou, that would be me.”</p>
<p>“And I the Vice  President,” Reito followed, standing as well.</p>
<p>“Then please, come  with us.”</p>
<p>Complying, I stepped out around my desk, leaving my belongings behind  as I walked to the front of the room. The concerned whispers of my  classmates reached my ears, and I made sure to give them a reassuring  smile before being ushered out the door along with Reito.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
I don’t know what it  was exactly that made me feel so compelled to stay, but I did.
<p>I  was currently in one of the rooms Dr. Watanabe used for his private  practice, lying on a low-sitting bed, staring up at the ceiling as  the events of the previous night, and the questions formed from them,  continued to occupy my thoughts. The doctor actually hadn’t arrived  until early this morning, thankfully not questioning just <em>how</em> I had managed to make it into his office, and I had taken the  opportunity of his examining the ever-sleeping girl as my chance to  try to rest my weary body. I had barely slept at all though, only  managing a few hours where I lightly dozed off.</p>
<p>All  through the night I had silently sat by Akane’s bed, watching as  the girl continued to struggle through her endless nightmare. It was  hard just sitting there feeling absolutely helpless, but other than  watching over her, I didn’t know what else I could do. Yamada had  called at one point to inform me that the doctor would be here as  soon as he could. Apparently he had been out of town visiting with  relatives when Yamada had informed him of our emergency, but with  some convincing, or bribery as my bank account and I  would soon find  out, the <em>kind</em> doctor had agreed to cut his little vacation short.</p>
<p>Frustrated and  restless, I shot up in the bed, swinging my legs over the side, and  made my way to the room a few doors down the hall. I knocked lightly  on the plastic surface before hearing a faint approval to enter, and  did so immediately.</p>
<p>I noticed that Akane  seemed to be resting more peacefully then when I had last seen her,  so as I walked in I made sure to be as quiet as possible, keeping my  distance from the bed as I stared down at her sleeping form.</p>
<p>“Will she be able to  talk?” I softly asked.</p>
<p>“Not for a while,”  the doctor informed me, “Well, I’ll give it a try.”</p>
<p>“Ka-Kazu-kun…Kazu-kun,”  Akane murmured, body straining, and my eyes dimmed at the sight.</p>
<p><em>I don’t know what  to do—!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly the door swung  open again, and I was shocked to see that it was Yamada who had only  left a couple of hours ago.</p>
<p>“It has begun.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You know how I told  you about that call I received from one of my cohorts about that  giant naval fleet that appeared to the east of the island?”</p>
<p>“Yeah…”</p>
<p>“Well, it really was  some unknown foreign army. They currently have Fuuka Academy  surrounded.”</p>
<p>My eyes widened,  “What?! Is it…Do you think it could be Searrs?”</p>
<p>“That would be my  first guess,” Yamada calmly stated.</p>
<p>My jaw clenched, fists  balling as my brow furrowed.</p>
<p><em>They’re looking  for the other HiMEs no doubt…Mai, Mikoto…No, everyone at the  school is in danger…I can’t just sit back and let Searrs get what  they want.</em></p>
<p>“Doctor,” I said,  snapping my head in Mr. Watanabe’s direction, “will you please  watch over Higurashi-san?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” came  the deep reply, and once I had that confirmation, I stormed out of  the room passed Yamada who quickly followed.</p>
<p>“What are the  details?”</p>
<p>“From what we can  tell, they have the entire school circumference guarded, and the  security only gets tighter the closer you get. Any kind of ground  entry is going to be virtually impossible, and even if you did manage  to get past the first wave, it would just get more difficult from  there,” the man rambled off as we walked through the building.</p>
<p>A devious smirk pulled  at my lips despite the surmounting obstacles threatening to hinder my  path.</p>
<p>“Fine then, we take to the skies.”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Although there’s a  media restriction in place, you know about the destruction of the  bridge. There’s a possibility that the group who destroyed it is  hiding on this campus.”
<p>Now  sitting in the privacy of the Student Council room, locked away from  the other students and the school staff, the two commanding officers  openly disclosed the current situation to us…but that didn’t mean  that I necessarily <em>believed</em> their story.</p>
<p>“Are you sure about  this?”</p>
<p>It seemed Reito felt  the same.</p>
<p>“In addition to the  bomb used to destroy the bridge, they could possess new viruses,”  the dark skinned woman continued, not even bothering with answering  the boy’s question, “I’d like you people to help as well.”</p>
<p>So  that was it…They wanted us to help them, but I knew they weren’t  telling us the whole truth. They were only giving us the bits and  pieces of what they <em>wanted</em> us to know, not allowing us to see the full picture. Whatever they  had shown Oonishi-sensei, they had failed to show us, which only  caused my suspicion to rise. It was quite clear what they were  doing…it was a fear tactic. Scare us into believing that there are  horrible, dangerous people on our campus, and inevitably we’ll lead  them right to the culprits. But no, I wasn’t about to jump into  their little game headfirst, be it the military or anyone else.</p>
<p>Opening my eyes from my  contemplation, I stared up into the viridian orbs of the female  officer with unwavering calmness.</p>
<p>“What’ll happen if  we refuse?”</p>
<p>Immediately, she, and  her blonde partner, scowled.</p>
<p>Defiance from a teenage  girl…obviously they weren’t too keen on the idea…</p>
<p>“You are not  permitted to refuse,” the woman immediately snapped down at me.</p>
<p>“I would assume so,”  I coolly responded, which only caused the crease in the commander’s  brow to deepen.</p>
<p>“The more you  cooperate with us, the faster we can get our job done. The longer  these terrorists are here only causes the danger for your school to  continue to rise. I’m sure that you Student Council members, being  in control of the school discipline, would have far more knowledge of  your fellow students than anyone else, which is why we sought out  your assistance,” the blonde man explained, speaking for the first  time since we had seen him.</p>
<p>Out  of the corner of my eye, I noticed Haruka shift her weight, arms  uncrossing as if she was about to speak, but thankfully Yukino was  there to calm her before anything could be said. The last thing I  wanted was for the zealous blonde to go off on these military  personnel <em>again</em>.  I very much wanted to stay in control of the situation as much as  possible. Getting too emotional would only give these people another  edge on us.</p>
<p>“I understand,” I  finally remarked, and both officers seemed to relax slightly,  “However, I do not know how much assistance we can offer without  knowing any further information.”</p>
<p>“There is only so  much that we have been permitted to tell you,” the older woman  answered, but before she could continue, both she and the blonde man  placed their hands up to their ears, obviously receiving a message  over their communicators.</p>
<p>Glancing at each other,  the tall male nodded at his counterpart and headed for the door,  quickly slipping outside without a word.</p>
<p>“It seems like the  sectioning is complete,” the female officer announced as she turned  back to us.</p>
<p>“<em>Sectioning</em>?”  Reito questioned for the rest of us.</p>
<p>“Yes, we’ve split  the school into separate rooms by gender so that we may begin  screening the girl’s without any trouble.”</p>
<p>“Examining<em>only</em> the girls?” I inquired, emotions managing to slip through my nearly  flawless façade. I was quick to put them back in check, but  that still didn’t erase the frown on my face.</p>
<p><em>What is the meaning  of this?</em></p>
<p>Slamming her fist down  on the desk in protest, Haruka lashed out for the first time since we  had entered the room.</p>
<p>“Give us a better  explanation! We can’t be convinced by what you said!”</p>
<p>Not giving the  rambunctious blonde even the slightest bit of attention, the woman  swiftly turned and proceeded to leave, shutting the door behind her  as she left the Executive Director fuming where she stood.</p>
<p>“They aren’t  looking for…”</p>
<p>The soft murmur from my  left barely reached my ears, and looking over I saw a very forlorn  looking Kikukawa-san. The quiet girl was gripping her arm, eyes fixed  on the spot she was covering. It was then that it hit me.</p>
<p><em>Sectioning the  students by gender…only examining the girls...are they…searching  for HiME? They would be looking for a specific mark, wouldn’t  they…and it would only be on a female…But does this mean that  Yukino-san is one as well—!</em></p>
<p>“Kaichou!  Fujino-kaichou! This is no time to space out!” Haruka’s voice  rang through my ears, effectively snapping me out of my thoughts.</p>
<p>“What is it,  Suzushiro-san?”</p>
<p>“We must do something  about this situation! Just because they’re military doesn’t mean  they can just do what they please!”</p>
<p>“Right now we don’t  have much of a choice, Haruka-san,” Reito piped in, walking over to  one of the tables to take a seat.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that  we should just give up?!” Haruka countered, hands in the air.</p>
<p>“Haruka-san…”  Yukino whispered, trying to calm her emotional friend.</p>
<p>“I think for the  moment we should remained composed,” I finally spoke, sending  Haruka a glance that she immediately huffed at. “They’ve kept us  here, which means that they still intend to use us in some form or  fashion,” I continued, “We should wait and see if they choose to  disclose any more information to us. As Reito said, I doubt there is  very much we could really do to abolish the situation anyway.”</p>
<p>Snarling, Haruka  stomped over to one of the empty chairs and forcefully sat herself  down, arms folded across her chest.</p>
<p>“Waiting…humph!”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
We had rode in Yamada’s  van for less than ten minutes, making our way outside of the  industrialized city before the man pulled over on the side of the  road and shifted the gear to park. I eyed him curiously before he  opened the door and stepped outside, and I was quick to do the same.  Once I had walked around the front of the vehicle, I opened my mouth  to speak, but I was quickly given a signal by the older man to remain  quiet, followed by a wave of the hand and a point towards the top of  the hill we were currently at the bottom of.
<p><em>What’s this about?</em></p>
<p>Silently we trekked for  several minutes, the grassy hill eventually fading into a rocky  cliff, and once at its edge, I saw what Yamada had brought us here  for.</p>
<p>A small group of  military soldiers, not only armed with artillery, but also  accompanied by a set of tanks, had set up a road blockade stopping  any traffic from entering further into Fuuka. My eyes narrowed at the  sight.</p>
<p>“That’s no ordinary  army,” Yamada finally spoke, “I’ve heard the Searrs Foundation  has its own private army that mobilizes only for its benefit.”</p>
<p>“That’s them?” I  questioned.</p>
<p>“Probably,” came  the simple response as the two of us continued to look on.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of  watching, I sighed, ready to get on with what I knew had to be done.</p>
<p>“So, about getting  into the school…” I began, turning as I started walking back to  the van.</p>
<p>My informant soon  followed, lagging a few steps behind me, “A helicopter is on the  way. I figured it was the easiest way to get close to the school by  air.”</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>“We’d better hurry.  My guy’s supposed to pick us up in half an hour.”</p>
<p>“That was quick,” I  commented, sparing a glance over my shoulder.</p>
<p>Yamada smirked, “That’s  what you’re paying me for, right?”</p>
<p>“Speaking of payment,  just how much is this helicopter going to cost me…?”</p>
<p>“You don’t want to  know.”</p>
<p><em>...Dammit.</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
When Suzushiro-san  stood from her seat, I immediately knew she had to be plotting  something.
<p>“Yukino and I are  going to the bathroom,” the blonde announced to the nearly empty  room as she grabbed the now brightly flushed girl beside her by the  wrist.</p>
<p>Yukino was slow to her  feet, and once she was standing, Haruka wasted no time in dragging  her to the door. The Executive director pounded on the thing, but  received no response from either of the soldiers stationed outside of  our room.</p>
<p><em>I wonder how this is  going to turn out…</em></p>
<p>“Excuse me!” Haruka  bellowed, her rare use of manners practically being eliminated by her  loud tone, “The secretary and I need to use the restroom.”</p>
<p>“Just hold it in,”  came the muffled response from behind the door.</p>
<p>Haruka’s muscles  coiled immediately.</p>
<p>“Hmf! Leave it to a  man to not understand a woman’s needs when she’s on her cycle!”</p>
<p><em>Oh my…</em></p>
<p>A few nearly inaudible  words were exchanged outside, and moments later, the door slid open.  The face of the man who appeared was certainly…appalled, to say the  least.</p>
<p>“F-Fine. We’ll  escort you…”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” came  the forced words from the blonde’s mouth, and no sooner had they  been said, the girl and her friend disappeared from my sight.</p>
<p>“She’s up to  something,” Reito commented from his spot by the window once they were gone, his back  still turned to the room’s interior.</p>
<p>“Is it not obvious?”  I answered.</p>
<p>“And you didn’t  want to do anything about it?”</p>
<p>“We both know how  Suzushiro-san is…Was there anything I really could do?”</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>“…I have to feel  some sympathy for Kikukawa-san though…”</p>
<p>“I agree.”</p>
<p>A deathly silence took  over the room, and I took the opportunity of that peaceful quiet to  leave my desk and join Reito by the window. Even as I approached him,  the Vice President still didn’t turn his gaze from the outside,  continuing to watch the many soldiers positioned around the school  instead.</p>
<p>“I can honestly say I  never expected to fine myself in a situation such as this,” I  remarked, looking out the window as well.</p>
<p>“An invading army is  not something that most schools tend to deal with…I assume,” came  the boys sarcastic response, but the usual smirk that accompanied it  was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>“…You’re still  worried about your friend.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Ara…Should  I just drop the ignorant act? This <em>friend</em> is Tokiha Mai-san, correct?”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“Word spreads quickly  around the school, you know…especially when Kanzaki Reito formally  asks a girl to the festival. Did something happen last night?”</p>
<p>“I think that should  be the least of our concerns at the moment, Fujino-san,” Reito  answered, his formality evidence of his unwillingness to speak about  the subject.</p>
<p>Despite the signs, I  persisted, “But I need my cool-headed Vice President in chaotic  moments like these. Even I am at a loss as to how to handle this  situation properly—”</p>
<p>“Is Kuga-san’s  absence the cause of your uneasiness?” he questioned, finally  turning his gaze upon me.</p>
<p>This time it was I who  turned silent.</p>
<p>Reito  continued, “<em>You</em> are worried about <em>her</em>,  are you not?”</p>
<p>Stalemate.</p>
<p>We had reached a spot  we both didn’t want to talk about, and thankfully before I was  forced to try to explain myself, heavy footsteps echoed down the  hall, and when the door slid back open, the two soldiers guarding our  room entered dragging an unconscious Haruka by the arms with them.</p>
<p>Both Reito and I went  from glancing over our shoulders to fully turning around.</p>
<p>“What happened?”  the dark haired boy spoke first.</p>
<p>Choosing not to answer,  the two military men proceeded to slump Haruka’s limp body into the  nearest chair.</p>
<p>“Where is  Kikukawa-san?” I pressed, but like Reito received no response.</p>
<p>Once the two men were  done with their disposing, they quickly exited, making sure to lock  the door to the room behind them.</p>
<p>Walking over, I leaned  Haruka back in her chair, examining her forehead that was already  beginning to swell and bruise.</p>
<p>“Reito, please get  the medical kit from the closet.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” came  his hasty reply as he set to get the item.</p>
<p>“Must you always be so reckless?” I whispered to the blonde girl  beside me with a sigh, and for once, Haruka remained quiet.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“There’s the  school,” I heard Yamada’s low voice sound from the front of the  helicopter, and instinctively I looked out the window.
<p>“This is as far as we  go, kid. As soon as they see us coming, there’s only going to be a  small window of opportunity for you to get in and for us to get out  safely,” the pilot, an acquaintance of Yamada, followed.</p>
<p>Duran, whom I had  summoned before we got into the chopper, emitted a low guttural growl  at the man’s words to me, and I gave him a pat on the nose to calm  him down.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know you  can’t go all the way to the school. Just get me as close as you  can—“</p>
<p>No sooner had the words  left my mouth, several Orphans appeared before us, a pair of flyers  and a few more on the ground. Instead of attacking us, though, their  attention seemed to be elsewhere, and cramming my face up against the  glass pane, I could see Mai’s fiery-orange hair amongst the green  of the forest below.</p>
<p>Yanking the door open,  I could hear the two males up front yell at me before I jumped, Duran  right behind me. The plummet wasn’t necessarily a very long one,  but I did have enough time to better take in my surroundings, this  time noticing the few armed soldiers that had also been thrown into  the mix. Summoning my pistols, however, I quickly disarmed them.</p>
<p>“Natsuki!” I heard  Mai call out right before I hit the ground.</p>
<p>“Keep your eyes  closed,” I ordered, and rising from my crouched position, I called  upon my Child.</p>
<p>“Duran! Load flash  cartridge…Fire!”</p>
<p>The deafening boom  radiated from the lithe wolf, the powerful fire of the shot sending a  blinding bluish-white light into the surrounding area for quite a  distance. Both men and beast cringed from the sudden blinding  illumination, quickly sheltering their eyes from the harmful rays. I  took that distraction to straddle my Child who immediately switched  to flight mode, and turning him around, I flew in the opposite  direction of our oppressors, making sure to pick up a stunned Mai  along the way.</p>
<p>“Grab the runt,” I  remarked over my shoulder, and speeding right past her, I could hear  Mikoto’s startled wailing as Mai grabbed the girl and dragged her  along behind us, Mikoto’s giant claymore kicking up dirt as we  escaped.</p>
<p>“C-Can’t we stop  now?” the redhead questioned me after a few minutes of zipping  through the woods, “I don’t know how much longer I can hold on to  her.”</p>
<p>Without a reply, I  slowed down to a stop near one of the rocky cliffs, the thud I heard  from behind me a sign that Mai had finally released the  middle-schooler.</p>
<p>We both dismounted, and  Mai immediately began rubbing her sore wrists, “You sure did show  up out of nowhere.”</p>
<p>“It looked like you  could need some help.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say I was  complaining—“</p>
<p>“What now?” Mikoto  interrupted our little exchange, swaying slightly from her unexpected  upside-down ride. The cat-like girl was quick to shake the queasiness  off though.</p>
<p>“The school’s  surrounded by soldiers, right? We can’t just leave things like they  are,” I remarked.</p>
<p>“They’re here  because of us, though,” Mai countered, “if we go back, we’ll  surely be captured.”</p>
<p>“You don’t think we  can take them?” I quipped, a single eyebrow raised.</p>
<p>“Alyssa-chan and Miyu  are behind all of this. They threatened to blow up the school if we  try anything…or if we don’t assist them in locating the other  HiMEs…” the other girl informed me, and I frowned at the news.</p>
<p><em>Those two again…</em></p>
<p>“Damn…then what are  we supposed to do?”</p>
<p>“…The shrine…”  Mai mumbled, appearing to be pondering out loud.</p>
<p>“Shrine…?” I  echoed, sparing a glance over to Mikoto who looked just as puzzled as  I was.</p>
<p>“It’s underneath  the school. I’ve been there once before on accident…Nagi said it  was safe there.”</p>
<p><em>Nagi, huh?</em></p>
<p>Needless to say, I was  skeptical.</p>
<p>“Are you sure we can  trust that creepy kid?”</p>
<p>“Do we have much of a  choice?” Mai shot back.</p>
<p>With a roll of my eyes,  I sighed.</p>
<p>“Fine, lead the way.”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
It was only after about  two hours of walking that we finally found an entry point into the  underground caverns that formed a maze under Fuuka Academy.  Unconfidently leading the way, Mai slowly trekked on, one hand  against the stone wall as guidence in the poor lighting. As we walked, which had  to have been another hour, the girl informed me of all that had  happened at the school; how she was taken to the Directors house  where she was interrogated by Alyssa and Miyu, her run-in with  Yuuichi and a girl named Shiho, and finally her meeting with me. I  let all the information sink in for a minute before processing a  response.
<p>“I see…then how  about Midori and the others?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.  Maybe they’re caught, maybe they got away,” came the vague  response.</p>
<p>“But I never knew  something like this existed below the Academy,” I muttered in both  awe and honesty.</p>
<p>The mystery that was  Fuuka just seemed to get deeper and deeper every day…I guess I  didn’t really have a reason to be shocked anymore, considering that  unexpected things seemed to arise on a daily basis as of late. I knew  this land was strange from the beginning. Apparently I wasn’t aware  of just how strange it was, and I wondered if I ever really would  know all there was to know about Fuuka.</p>
<p>We had only moved a  couple of yards forward when the cave suddenly opened up to a large  space, a single odd column rising from the ground near it’s center.  There was a slight glow to the room, but what caught my attention the  most was a symbol hauntingly familiar to the HiME mark on my side  painted on the wall before us. Even this place seemed to be related  to the HiME…</p>
<p>Despite having been to  this place before, Mai gasped when she saw the place, and I was  baffled by the reaction. Was something different from what she had  seen before? I watched as the girl’s violet eyes scanned the tall  pillar, but before I could question her on the subject, a man’s  voice echoed from a short distance away, taking us all by surprise.</p>
<p>“We’ve been  expecting you,” the suited male informed us, flashlight in hand. He  turned the thing to motion us onward, “Please, this way.”</p>
<p>The three of us  exchanged silent glances, and curiosity getting the best of me, I  shrugged and moved forward, Mai and Mikoto following my lead.</p>
<p>Walking only a short  way, we reached a steep drop that led down to dark waters, and also a  small boat that seemed to be awaiting us. I paused at the top,  waiting for our “tour guide” to make the crossing first, and once he  was inside the vessel, I cautiously maneuvered my way down as well.  Once we were all situated inside, Mr. Sunglasses at the controls, Mai  and Mikoto on the middle seat, and me sitting on the edge of the boat  with feet on the cushioned padding of the back seat, we took off even  deeper into the dark abyss.</p>
<p>“Hey,” Mai  eventually whispered to me, “you think we can trust him?”</p>
<p><em>You’re asking that  NOW?</em></p>
<p>Disregarding the  thought, I smirked as I summoned my element, “If we have to…”</p>
<p>It didn’t take us  very long before an opening in the cave wall presented itself, the  light coming from the space brightening our path as we cruised  forward. We entered an even larger open area than before, and it was  a shock to see the giant rock erupting skyward from the water, a  collection of brightly lit screens clustered around an odd form that  hung from the cave’s ceiling. Spotlights positioned in the water  near the natural structure’s base illuminated the “island” even  further. It seemed far too Hollywood to be anything but manmade.</p>
<p>“Wh-What’s this?”  Mai muttered as we floated closer to the thing.</p>
<p>“Sister! Nao!”  Mikoto suddenly exclaimed, and as she did so, I too saw a similar  boat carrying the two women.</p>
<p>“Hey, everyone’s  safe?” Midori’s voice emerged from the darkness as a third boat  entered the area.</p>
<p>“Midori-chan…Yukino-chan,  too.”</p>
<p><em>So they’re all  HiMEs…</em></p>
<p>I pondered this to  myself as I continued to watch the situation before me unfold, jaw  slacked and mouth hanging slightly agape all the while. It was far  too much for my brain to process at the time, so I dumbly remained  silent as I persistently tried to keep up.</p>
<p>“HiMEs,” a voice  from above suddenly announced, and every one of us instantaneously  craned our necks to seek the source of the oddly familiar tone.</p>
<p>Atop the rocky  structure, Kazahana Mashiro, along with her maid Himeno Fumi,  appeared. Despite the situation, I couldn’t help but scream in my  mind that I was absolutely right about my feelings of the young  director. Shushing my inner voice, I listened further with a creased  brow.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you have  all made it here. This is Kokuyouguu. The center of Fuuka, and the  last defense of the Academy.”</p>
<p><em>Just what is going  on here?!</em></p>
<p>We all remained silent  as the boats floated closer together, congregating at the base of the  rock structure so we could ascend the steps that led up to its flat  top. Being the last of the group to step onto dry land, Mai, Mikoto  and myself trailed behind the group, the redhead nudging me with her  elbow as we continued up the steep set of stairs before she leaned in to  whisper in my ear.</p>
<p>“Do you think this  has something to do with the school?”</p>
<p>“Most likely,” I  simply replied, and the girl became silent afterward.</p>
<p>When we finally reached  the top, we joined the other girls already grouped in front of the  Rijichou, walking around them so we could get closer to the  wheelchair-bound girl. Once we had settled into our positions, Mai  was the first to speak.</p>
<p>“Umm…Director, why  did you call all of us here?”</p>
<p>“No reason other than  to have all of you save the Academy,” the violet-haired girl began,  “The ones occupying the place are from the Searrs Foundation. They  are after all of you in order to monopolize the HiME Star. The HiME  of the foundation, Alyssa Sears. Her guard, Miyu Greer. If they are  unable to accomplish their mission, they will destroy the whole  Academy along with all the students…Just like they demolished the  bridge yesterday.”</p>
<p><em>No way…</em></p>
<p>“That was…Alyssa’s  power?” I questioned, my apprehension evident in my tone.</p>
<p>“The satellite,  Eclipse One. This seems to be her Child when she ignites her power,”  Kazahana explained.</p>
<p>“Alyssa-chan…?” I  heard Yukariko Sanada murmur from the back of the group, obviously in  disbelief that the small child could be capable of such a thing.</p>
<p>I knew otherwise  though. After having tangoed with the Searrs girl and her guardian  robot on two separate occasions, I knew not to let my defenses down  for a second around either one. But still…how was Alyssa able to  control a satellite that was in orbit?</p>
<p><em>How is ANY of this  possible? </em></p>
<p>“She was searching  for HiMEs,” Mai stated to erase the nun’s doubt, “So if we  leave, she may free everyone.”</p>
<p>“Heh, what are you  talking about?” Nao spoke up for the first time since we had been  gathered, officially catching everyone’s attention, “That’s so  unlikely.”</p>
<p>As pessimistic as it  sounded, I knew she was right.</p>
<p>“Do you think they  would even consider ordinary negotiation?” I added in all  seriousness.</p>
<p>“But…” Mai tried  to counter.</p>
<p>Turning my gaze from  the busty girl, I focused on the Rijichou, “Clarify something for  me. Is Higurashi Akane a HiME?”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Kazahana  straightened in her chair, a look of surprise in her light blue eyes  before a grave expression racked her features, “Akane-san was  defeated…by Miyu Greer. Rather than a threat to the Academy, she’s  a threat to HiMEs. Therefore…”</p>
<p><em>Seems we’re stuck  between a rock and a hard place…</em></p>
<p>“Fine with me,” I  began, “I don’t like cooperating with you First District people,  but I guess it’s not the time to be saying that.”</p>
<p>Behind me, I heard  Mikoto make a noise of acknowledgement.</p>
<p><em>Well, that makes two  of us.</em></p>
<p>“To protect everyone,  we have to fight and win,” Midori piped in, “It’s a HiME of  Justice’s job.”</p>
<p>“Midori-chan…”  Mai whispered.</p>
<p>Nao was the next to  comment in her usual self-centered manner.</p>
<p>“Give me a break.  Thanks for letting me off the hook.”</p>
<p>I smirked at her words,  “Do as you like, if you’re confident that you can escape on your  own.”</p>
<p>The middle schooler  scoffed at me, but I paid her no heed.</p>
<p>“Mai,” I continued,  awaiting the girl’s decision.</p>
<p>“Will you make one  promise…to prioritize the safety of everyone in the Academy over  everything else.”</p>
<p>The request sounded  more like an order, but Kazahana nodded her consent.</p>
<p>“I promise.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” the redhead  agreed.</p>
<p>“Oh, right, it’s  decided then,” Sugiura-sensei stated the obvious.</p>
<p>“Oh Lord…”  Sanada-san muttered.</p>
<p>“Give me a break,  seriously…” Nao mumbled to herself.</p>
<p>Mentally, I sighed.</p>
<p><em>It’ll be a miracle if I survive working with all of these  people…</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The sun had set hours  ago, and still there had been no change.
<p>There were still guards  stationed outside of our door, although they had been taking shifts  every couple of hours. Haruka still remained unconscious at one the  tables, and Reito was still positioned by the window. After our  little standoff had been interrupted, and after I had attended to  Suzushiro-san, I had returned to my desk, and remained there for most  of the evening. By now my rear end was beyond numb, but my endless  stream of thoughts kept me still.</p>
<p>Was this army really  after us HiME? If that were true, I was certainly in danger, but by  some chance or another, the military personnel had never asked to  examine me, at least not yet anyway. What bothered me the most,  however, was my uncertainty when it came to Natsuki. Instinct told me  that she was indeed a HiME like myself, and it also led me to believe  that she was safe, but there was no way to be sure. If only I could  call her, I kept yearning in my mind, to just make sure that she was  far away from this place and would remain that way, but I knew I  would never be able to receive that answer with things the way they  were.</p>
<p>Kiyohime. I’m not  sure how many times the thought floated to the top of my mind, but I  knew I couldn’t call upon my Child. It would be too dangerous…too  risky. Only under the most extreme of circumstances would I call out  to the mighty hydra, but how was I to know if Natsuki was in a  situation like that?</p>
<p><em>Just believe in  her…and her strength. She’ll be all right.</em></p>
<p>Fishing my cell phone  out of my bag, I flipped the near-useless device open, taking note  that it was already well past twelve o’clock.</p>
<p><em>I wonder how much  longer we’re going to be stuck here…</em></p>
<p>Exhaustion had set upon  me not too long ago, but I made sure to keep awake at all cost, and  that seemed to be a good thing as moments later I heard Reito call my  name quietly.</p>
<p>“Shizuru,” the  young man stated, making sure to keep his voice down so we wouldn’t  draw the attention of the guards outside.</p>
<p>Quietly I stood from my  desk and walked forward, Reito turning to meet me with a piece of  paper in his hands.</p>
<p>“What is this?” I  questioned.</p>
<p>“It just flew in  through the window,” the boy informed me, seeming quite as  astonished as I was before studying the thing carefully, “it  appears to be a plan of escape.”</p>
<p>Offering the sheet  over, I immediately took the thing from him to look at it myself.</p>
<p>“…It says they’re  going to draw out the army in the morning…and that we should take  that chance to escape to the mountains with the students…”</p>
<p>“But I wonder just  who <em>they</em> are,” Reito remarked.</p>
<p>“Indeed, I too would  like to know who’s trying to help us...It’s not like we have too  many options though. I guess we’ll just have to wait and see.”</p>
<p>“Agreed…” the  Vice President replied before turning back to the window, “I wonder  how our classmates are holding up…”</p>
<p>“I’m sure they’re  fine. I doubt this army would have the nerve to harm them in any  way.”</p>
<p>“I hope you’re  right, Kaichou-san,” Reito stated before becoming silent once  again.</p>
<p>And at that, I sighed and returned to my desk, setting the mysterious  message down on its top before situating myself back into my chair.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“So this masks the  Academy’s view of the outside world?”
<p>“This is useful.”</p>
<p>“Amazing, Yukino!”</p>
<p>It really was quite  impressive. The mousey girl, whom all I really knew about was her  position on the Student Council and her friendship with the Executive  Director, had just returned from her objective of creating a  mirror-like barrier around the entire circumference of the school  with the help of her Child, Diana. This was the first step in our  plan to save the school from the Searrs organization’s military  that had taken over Fuuka Academy. Now that our camouflage was in  place we could use our Childs in the fight without the risk of being seen  and our identities exposed to the world. With this done, the real  battle was about to begin.</p>
<p>“Everyone, the  preparations are complete,” Mashiro announced, “There are six  hours left until the satellite has the Academy within its range. If  we can rescue the students and get Alyssa Searrs within that time, we  will be victorious. Good luck.”</p>
<p>The Director gave us a  nod, and at that signal, Mai, Mikoto, Midori and I took off to  our planned positions. The underground defense system had secret  exits to various places around the school, which is exactly what we  needed to get a jump on the soldiers surrounding the school.</p>
<p>Earlier, we had split  in to two groups: a ground team and an air team. Mai and Midori would  take to the skies and distract the battleships that were harbored in  the nearby bay. In the meantime, Mikoto, Nao, and I were to take out  the troops near the school, allowing safe passage for the students to  escape.</p>
<p>As I stepped onto the  giant elevator lift, the heels of my boots clanking against the  metal, the wire-frame doors closed behind me, sirens blaring in my  ears as their red lights danced across my face. There was a jolt, and  the mechanism began its slow climb to the surface. I wasn’t  entirely sure just where I would surface, but it didn’t matter. I  would be close enough to the school to find my way.</p>
<p>“Duran!” I called  to my Child, and in a flash he appeared before me, greeting me with a  might howl.</p>
<p>I dropped to one knee  as I petted his silver muzzle, “You ready to do this?”</p>
<p>The wolf’s red eyes  flashed, a confident confirmation.</p>
<p>I smirked, “Me too.”</p>
<p>Standing once again, I  took in a deep breath, the murky underground air seeming to clog my  lungs like smoke. I turned my gaze skyward, and eventually a single  ray of the early morning's sunlight emerged from above, causing me to squint. Finally we  reached the top, the elevator shaking me once again as it locked into  place. With a final flick of my hair, I mounted my Child, and once I  heard an inhuman cry in the distance, recognizable as Mai’s  Kagutsuchi, I ordered him forward.</p>
<p>“Go! Duran!”</p>
<p>The wolf howled again  as he started his sprint, moving at an uncanny speed. The wind  whistled passed my ears, cooling my features as we made our way closer  to the school. It didn’t take long before a clearing came into  view, and immediately Duran leapt into the air, using the burners of  his flight mode to keep us airborne and positioning us right above a  group of soldiers.</p>
<p>The unsuspecting men  didn’t even see us coming.</p>
<p>Shoving myself off of  the silver wolf’s back and materializing my pistols in the process,  I allowed Duran to move in mere second before myself to draw  the attention of the soldiers, and as soon as he jumped away, I  dropped right into the middle of the group.</p>
<p>An elbow to the chest.</p>
<p><em>One down.</em></p>
<p>A spinning handstand  kick.</p>
<p><em>Two.</em></p>
<p>A hip-check, followed  by another elbow-to-chest connection.</p>
<p><em>Three.</em></p>
<p>Whipping my pistols  around, I began hailing upon the other soldiers I had just caught the  attention of. I needed them gone so that Mikoto could do her job, and  that’s exactly what I did. No sooner had I finished, I heard the  young girl’s screaming followed by the large explosion of the tank  she had just single-handedly sliced in half. I took a moment to gawk  at the sight before resuming my assault upon remaining soldiers in  the area.</p>
<p>Once we had finished  there, Mikoto and I met up and began our patrol around the school,  and it didn’t take us long before we laid eyes upon Nao’s work.  There were several soldiers bound in sticky web, many hanging from  the trees.</p>
<p><em>So she did come  along…I guess she can do some good after all—</em></p>
<p>“Everyone’s still  alive,” I heard Mikoto murmur, looking back over the battlefield,  “We don’t have to finish them off?”</p>
<p>“Let them be,” I  replied. Killing these men weren’t part of the plan, and besides,  it wasn’t like we had the time to deal with them anyway.</p>
<p>“Yukino, what’s the  status?” I called out to the air, and moments later, one of the  panel-bearing transparent spores drifted in front of me, a visual of  the girl showing on the screen.</p>
<p>“Y-Yes. Umm…” she  paused, looking over the various plates in front of her before she  gasped surprisingly, “Tate-kun!?”</p>
<p>“What? He’s not in  the school?” I questioned.</p>
<p>“N-No, he’s headed  your way right now, close to the track.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” I said  before doubling back to our previous war zone, Mikoto right behind  me.</p>
<p>As we approached, I  could see the blonde male standing amongst the chaos that had just  ensued. His stationary form was evidence of his shock as he gazed  around, but when I sensed movement out of the corner of my eye, I was  quick to raise my pistol, firing a single ice blast at the soldier  who had begun to raise his own gun at the boy. Duran was quick to  hold him down.</p>
<p>“Why are you roaming  around here?!” I yelled.</p>
<p>“Kuga?” Tate stated  in a dumbfounded manner, “I want to help out—“</p>
<p>“Get out!” I  interrupted, “Leave this place. There’s nothing you can do here.”</p>
<p>Turning, I ran back  towards the school. Sure, my words might have sounded harsh, but  having him, or anyone else for that matter, roaming around would only  cause us more trouble. They would only get in the way, and that was  the last thing we needed at the moment.</p>
<p>“Yukino,” I called  out once again, “is the school secure now?”</p>
<p>Another spore appeared  before us, hovering along as we ran, “Yes, it seems so. Meet by the  front of the school. That’s where Nao is currently waiting.”</p>
<p>“Right. We’re on our way.”</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for us to round the side of the building, the  red-haired girl easily coming into view. From a distance, I watched  as she kicked one of the squirming males at her feet, beaming at the  apparent pleasure it brought her. I snarled, but otherwise chose to  overlook it.</p>
<p>“Nao!” Mikoto shouted, effectively getting the middle schooler’s  attention.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s about time you two got here. I was getting bored.”</p>
<p>“I guess that means things are clear here?” I asked, my tone a  bit harsh.</p>
<p>“Hmf, of course,” the girl shrugged, “I can take care of  myself, Kuga.”</p>
<p>“Right,” I commented, squinting at her momentarily before I  turned back towards the spore that was still present, “Yukino, what  about Alysssa? Is she still hiding?”</p>
<p>There was a pause as the girl looked over her panels.</p>
<p>“I found her! She’s by the shore,” another pause, “Mai and  Midori are on their way, please hurry.”</p>
<p>“We’re coming,” I assured, and the spore vanished before my  eyes.</p>
<p>I looked down at Mikoto, both of us exchanging a nod before the girl  took off to our next destination. I remained stationary for a moment,  gazing back over my shoulder at Nao.</p>
<p>“Are you coming, or not?”</p>
<p>A shrug.</p>
<p>Releasing a raspy sigh with a shake of my head, I ignored the vague  response and began my sprint towards the bay.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“They’re leaving…”
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The troops,” Reito  elaborated, “Looks like we can trust that message’s escape plan.”</p>
<p>What could have caused  this sudden movement? Nothing had happened from what we could tell.  We had heard gunfire and a few explosions, but we had yet to see any  of the apparent action that was taking place elsewhere. Although my  suspicion and curiosity were rapidly rising, I pushed down the urge to panic,  kept myself calm, and prepared myself to take charge of the  situation.</p>
<p>“Then let us get  going, too,” I remarked, standing from my desk.</p>
<p>It was then that Haruka  suddenly jolted from her slumber, her startled noises evidence of the  aftershock of whatever she had gone through.</p>
<p>“Suzushiro-san, we’re  glad to have you back,” Reito stated, a slight twinkle of mirth in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Wh-Wha—“</p>
<p>“Now’s not the  time,” I commented, getting both of their attention, “we need to  find the students and lead them to the mountains.”</p>
<p>“The mountains?”  Haruka questioned, “Why are we—“</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you  later, just come with me for now,” I insisted, as I slid the door  open and proceeded to walk out of the room, Reito and Haruka filing  in behind me.</p>
<p>“The soldiers said  the students were sectioned, correct? I’ll go check the gymnasium,”  the Vice President stated before walking down the hall, leaving  Suzushiro-san and I in the otherwise lifeless hallway.</p>
<p>As soon as Reito had  disappeared around the corner, I turned and headed in the opposite  direction.</p>
<p>“Eh? H-Hey,  Fujino-kaichou!”</p>
<p>“We do not have time  to waste, Suzushiro-san.”</p>
<p>It only took the  Executive Director a few seconds to catch up to me, her heavy steps  drowning out my own lighter ones as we walked.</p>
<p>“What about the  soldiers—“</p>
<p>“While you were  sleeping,” I cut her off, “They started to disperse. This is the  ample time to free the students and retreat from the school.”</p>
<p>“Do you even know  where they’re being held?”</p>
<p>“It would have to be  a large area…If Reito is checking the gym, the only other places I  could imagine would be the cafeteria or the observatory. I want you  to check the lunch room, okay?”</p>
<p>“Right,” the girl  affirmed, for once not seeming to second-guess my judgment in the  least.</p>
<p>Once we had split, I  walked to the front of the school and once I got there, well, the  world seemed to stop moving for one eternal yet fleeing moment.</p>
<p><em>Natsuki.</em></p>
<p>It was really her,  adorned in her usual biking leathers. The rest of my surroundings  faded away as I watched her running, running away from me and into  the unknown danger that must have been lying beyond the school grounds. It was  almost like it was all happening in slow motion. I was frozen in  place, and it took me a minute to realize my arm was stretched out  toward her.</p>
<p><em>Natsuki really is...a  HiME...</em></p>
<p>That image of her  retreating back, her dark locks weightlessly flowing behind her, a  silvery-metallic wolf at her side, was instantly engraved in my mind.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as I saw  her, my friend disappeared around the school, and it was then that I  finally snapped out of my daze, regaining my senses in the process.  The venomous stench of smoke hit me first, and as a result I scanned  my surroundings. Destroyed tanks, unconscious soldiers, guns…it was  utter destruction and madness in a place that had once been peaceful.  I swallowed hard, my mouth becoming dry at the sight. My mind  screamed out for my Child, for the comfort and protection that I knew  she could bring, but I stifled those feelings and continued on  towards the observatory as fast as my legs could carry me.</p>
<p><em>I’m the President  of the student council. I have a job to do. I can’t let my own  personal feelings endanger the entire student body—</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Why do you  continue to suppress it? She could be in danger...you don’t really  care about those other people…</strong></em></p>
<p>The voice from the  depths of my mind flirted with me, causing me to freeze mid-step  before I took a deep breath and pushed it back with all the willpower  I could muster.</p>
<p>Hastily I approached  the glass building that was the school observatory, and once I had  opened the door, a multitude of scared and concerned faces turned  towards me.</p>
<p>“Kaichou-san…”  the low murmur sounded from the crowd.</p>
<p>I took a half step  back, pressing my back against the opened door, “I know that things  are confusing right now, but we’re evacuating the school. Please,  remain calm and exit the building. Everyone to the mountain.”</p>
<p>It took a few minutes,  but after everyone was gathered outside I took my lead in front of  the group. Before I could speak, however, Haruka-san approached me.</p>
<p>“Fujino!”</p>
<p>“Suzushiro-san, did  you find any more students?”</p>
<p>“No,” came the  simple response before the girl pointed to the group, “Is this  everyone? All of the girls?”</p>
<p>“There’s no way to  be sure, but I would assume so. The boys must be with Reito.”</p>
<p>“<em>Assume so</em>?!  Kaichou-san—!”</p>
<p>“You didn’t run  into any other students, did you?”</p>
<p>“Well, no—“</p>
<p>“Then yes, this is  everyone,” I concluded before turning back to the group, “This  way. I ask that everyone please look out for one another. We will  leave no one behind.”</p>
<p>“Haruka-san,” I  stated, turning back to the girl beside me, “could you please watch  over the rear?”</p>
<p>The blonde eyed me momentarily before consenting with a silent nod,  and with that, we began our trek into the wilderness.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
There she was, that  little blonde bitch, singing like everything was just fine and dandy. It  seemed her robot guardian was still functioning as well.
<p>“You guys!” I  yelled out as Mikoto, Duran, and I left the cover of the trees, Nao a  few paces behind.</p>
<p>Miyu glanced over her  shoulder, and immediately I poised myself for any oncoming strike.  None came as it appeared we were being insultingly ignored, and as  the silver-haired machine turned her gaze back around, Mai and her  Child appeared from the cliff’s edge. Midori appeared with hers  moments later.</p>
<p>“Alyssa-chan,” Mai  said, her tone pleading, and the girl actually stopped her singing to  look up at the redhead, “Let’s stop this. Yes?”</p>
<p>“It’s impossible,”  came the cold, emotionless response.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“We have reasons and  the desire to exercise our power,” Miyu spoke out this time,  “That’s why we are fighting.”</p>
<p>“But you have  neither. That’s why you want to ask about the reasons” the young  blonde added, “You don’t have anyone to trust, or true  determination. You don’t know what you truly want to do, nor do you  have desires. We can’t afford to leave the power of the Star to  people such as yourselves.”</p>
<p><em>What kind of  bullshit is this kid saying—</em></p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the girl  turned her face towards the sky as she continued, “Just because  it’s a satellite, that doesn’t mean it travels at a constant  speed. Looks like the match is settled.”</p>
<p>The words sent chills  down my spine, but contrarily my temperature rose from the anger  building up inside of me. I grimaced at my own powerlessness, but it  seemed like the worst was still to come.</p>
<p>“No matter where the  students may run, they’re unable to get out of Artemis’ range,”  Alyssa concluded, removing her ribbon and setting her golden locks  free as they glowed a luminescent light.</p>
<p>Perfectly on cue, the  sky began to darken and a mysterious ring of light emerged before us,  similar to an aurora. The ground beneath Alyssa began to glow,  forming a circle at her feet as a similar spot began to form in the  sky directly above her.</p>
<p>“Please, stop,” Mai  tried once again.</p>
<p>“There’s one  condition” the girl replied, “surrender to the Searrs.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“Then I have no  choice…Artemis, the Golden Lightning.”</p>
<p>“Kagutsuchi!” Mai  cried out, and the mighty dragon instantaneously began his ascent.</p>
<p>“Mai-chan!” Midori  called out to no avail.</p>
<p>“What is she  thinking?!” I questioned out loud.</p>
<p>Helplessly we watched  as Mai rocketed into the sky towards the growing light above. My  teeth gritted as my fingers curled into fists, and then, suddenly, the sky parted  and a powerful beam of energy tore through the clouds. I watched  through wide eyes as Kagutsuchi took the blow directly with his body,  preventing the destructive blast from incinerating us all.</p>
<p><em>Mai!</em></p>
<p>A mighty explosion  deafened my ears as all that around me faded to white, and when my  vision returned, all that was left in the sky was a falling ball of  fire, it’s wispy smoke tail growing by the second.</p>
<p>A great pulse.</p>
<p>A second.</p>
<p>And then what only  could be defined as a giant portal of fire formed above us, blocking  out the clouded sky. The center of the portal bulged for only a moment  before a shadow creature emerged from the flame. I watched in  dumbfounded awe as the dragon Child was born once again, shedding  it’s ash-like shell for it’s former skin, although this time,  Kagutsuchi took on the form of something more like a space craft from  a sci-fi film than his more organic self.</p>
<p>A flash, and Mai  reappeared upon her Child.</p>
<p>“Mai!” Mikoto  called out, happy to see her friend was all right as I blankly stared  on.</p>
<p><em>Wh-What…? Eh?!</em></p>
<p>The busty girl was only  seen for a second, as moments later the mighty dragon once again  soared off into the sky, only this time he, along with Mai,  disappeared from our sights completely.</p>
<p>Silently we watched the  heavens, waiting for a sign…a return…but after only a few short  minutes had passed, that silence was shattered by a pain-wracked  scream from the Searrs girl.</p>
<p>“Ojou-sama!” Miyu cried, catching the young girl before she could fall to the ground.</p>
<p>Jumping down from  Gakutenou, Midori joined us on the cliff as I took a step forward,  raising one of my pistols at the two huddled before me.</p>
<p>“It’s over,” I  informed them, my tone flat, “Surrender.”</p>
<p>“Ojou-sama…” the  android whispered again, paying me no heed.</p>
<p><em>Danger.</em></p>
<p>The thought entered my  mind, clearly sent from my Child. I peered down at Duran, and when I  followed his gaze, I saw exactly what he meant.</p>
<p>In the sky, slowly  flying towards us were five small dots of lights.</p>
<p>“Missiles. Run for  it!” I yelled out to the others, all four of us, along with our  Childs, immediately bolting inland.</p>
<p>As we ran, I couldn’t  help but look back over my shoulder.</p>
<p>Alyssa and Miyu. They hadn’t  moved at all. They just…sat there…in each other’s arms, despite  the doom that was quickly approaching. Didn’t they care that they  were about to die?</p>
<p>My thoughts were  abruptly cut short when the missiles struck.</p>
<p>The earth shook.</p>
<p>My footing faltered.</p>
<p>A splash, and suddenly  I was submerged in chilly water. Panic struck, the memories of the  crash from my childhood taking over as I hurriedly swam towards the  light above. I surfaced, taking in the precious air into my lungs as  I surveyed the now destroyed cliff we had just been standing on.</p>
<p><em>Alyssa…Miyu…What  happened to them?</em></p>
<p>As I watched the pillar  of black smoke emitting from the water a few yards away, Mikoto  popped her head up from the watery depths with a gasp. It was then  that a cool piece of ice landed on my noses, and instinctively I  looked up.</p>
<p>“Snow…?”</p>
<p>“Is it from the  explosion?” I heard Midori question.</p>
<p>“Who knows?” came  Nao’s usual dull response.</p>
<p>“Either way, we  should head towards the shore,” I commented before beginning the  swim back to land.</p>
<p>It didn’t take us  long before we reached a low enough path to dry land. My wet hair  clung to my back as I walked out of the water, and despite my  leathers that had kept me fairly dry, I shivered. Whether it was from  the cold or as a result of everything that had just taken place, I  wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>We were all ashore,  silently standing in a line as we watched the waters before us ebb  and flow as the sky continued to cry it’s cold, soft tears. They  littered the ground and trees, covering everything with their white  substance.</p>
<p>Suddenly my body  jerked, the front of my jacket being pulled and urging me forward,  but I resisted the movement with the weight of my body as I looked  down into the tear-filled golden eyes of the dark haired girl before  me.</p>
<p>“Mai! Isn’t Mai  coming back?!” Mikoto desperately questioned me.</p>
<p>My entire visage  drooped at her words, and not finding her much-needed encouragement,  the girl moved on.</p>
<p>“Midori! What  happened to Mai?!”</p>
<p>Not even the generally  happy Sensei could muster up a response as her own features saddened  to mirror my own.</p>
<p>“Mai…MAI!” Mikoto  wailed, dropping to her knees as she openly sobbed.</p>
<p>Luckily Midori moved to  try and comfort the girl, kneeling down beside her as she drew her  into an awkward embrace.</p>
<p><em>Mai…Why did  you…are you…</em></p>
<p>I closed my eyes as my  bottom lip began to tremble, but I quickly collected myself.</p>
<p>“What now?” Nao  asked, arms still crossed over her chest.</p>
<p>I glanced over at the  girl whom, for once, actually seemed to be slightly saddened.</p>
<p>“I…I don’t know…”  I muttered.</p>
<p>“Hm. Well, I’m not  staying around here,” the girl stated before she turned, and with a  small wave of her clawed hand, headed back towards the school.</p>
<p>“Hey, Kuga-san,” I  heard Midori start, and turning my eyes back towards the woman, I  watched as she stood and walked closer to where I stood.</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Do you think you  could, you know…” the teacher began, nodding her head in Mikoto’s  direction.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Would you mind  staying with her? You know, stay in the dorms for the night…”</p>
<p>“Uh, s-sure…”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” the woman  replied, giving me a pat on the shoulder before she returned to the  young girl and helped her off the ground.</p>
<p>Once Mikoto was up, all three of us began the long trek back towards  the Academy dorms, and, hopefully, a peaceful evening.</p>

<strong>AN</strong>: That’s  episodes 14 and 15 for you. I know it just sort of ended without any  real conclusion, but the next chapter is going to pick up pretty much  where this one left off, or it’ll at least explain what happened  before episode 16 picks up.</span>
