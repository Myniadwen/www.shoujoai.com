<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hell #2</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  were professional, all right, and they’d been working together  longer than Natsuki cared to imagine; that was obvious.  They  advanced in a staggered line, backs bent, assault rifles held to eye  level, aimed both at and past the group.  There were at least twenty  of them, and they moved quickly and without reservation, knowing for  certain that nobody was going to be sneaking up behind them because  that was where their backup was.  Natsuki thought of going for her  gun—she kept it on her now, and if any police showed up to talk to  her about it, she would have a few things to talk to <em>them </em>about—but decided against it. Even as HiME, the situation was  more or less untenable. They had them by the balls, but good, and  Natsuki knew it.  Shizuru, wrapped now in a robe, shifted against  her, and Natsuki knew that Shizuru knew it too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai felt  Mikoto begin to move.  An unconscious twitch, maybe, from an old,  now-defunct reflex, or something else.  She clamped her hand—the  one which was not tightly gripped in Yuuichi’s—down on the  younger girl’s shoulder, staring at the advancing column of  black-clad infantry in a mix of horror and wonder, and whispered,  “Stay here, Mikoto.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t like them,” Mikoto murmured, relaxing nonetheless.  “They’re…bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>This  whole trip is bad. This whole </em>world <em>has gone bad.  What’s  one more group of soldiers on top of that?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Stop  it. That’s not you. Stop it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even  so, Mai had no idea what to say.  What did you say to a platoon of  advancing soldiers? <em>Hey, bathroom’s on the right, but you gotta  buy something if you want to use it.  Don’t forget to wipe. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  thought made Mai want to giggle a little hysterically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oddly,  it was Minoru, the one of them who <em>didn’t </em>belong, who  addressed the soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s  your business here?” he said.  Mai was shocked—<em>he, </em>a man  just moving into middle-age, a man getting a little soggy around the  midsection, with, from what Mai could gather, no apparent talent for  combat,was demanding something of the platoon of advancing  infantry, with guns that looked like they could take a tank apart in  seconds?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Apparently,  he was.  The soldiers stopped about five meters in front of them, and  none of them moved for a moment.  Minoru picked one out—it seemed  at random, but Mai doubted it was—and asked again.  “Talking to  you, Sergeant,” he said, his voice pointed and authoritative.  “What’s your business? You got none, me and my friends would  appreciate you moving along.  If you’re looking for somebody to  shoot, there’s plenty of ‘em in the woods, I’m sure you’re  aware.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Orders  received,” the man he was speaking to said, obviously not to him.  “Will comply.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Silence  for a moment, and then the man said, “Minoru Alder. Our employer is  willing to buy your contract from Gina in payment for your  noninterference from here onward.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Someone  from their group murmured something, and Mai herself was a little  taken aback. <em>Contract? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Uh-uh,”  Minoru said, with an air of a father addressing his petulant son.  “Not so easy. I’ve had one shit contract already this week, and  I’m lucky to be standing here telling you about it. How about you  state your business, and then we can talk about contracts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  clearance for civilians,” the man said curtly. “If you show  resistance, we will retaliate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Clearance,  my ass. You’re mercs,” Minoru said angrily.  “I can smell my  own.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Irrelevant.  Noncompliance will result in retaliation. Stand aside.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where  do you hail from, I wonder? Are you the Swiss Remnants? Chinese? You  guys just a starter company hoping to cash it big off the  Sino-Russian conflict before it ended? Shit, are you even out of your  teens yet, Sarge?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minoru,”  Midori murmured. “What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Putting  a little kid in his place, Midori,” Minoru said. “This <em>sergeant</em> here,” he said it like it was a dirty word, “Isn’t even your  age. Fuck knows he’s got no place ordering me around.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>They  look pretty professional to me, </em>Mai thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Step.  Aside.” The soldier lowered his weapon and drew his sidearm, a big,  nasty-looking pistol with a hefty silencer on it. “Orders are not  to harm the teenagers, but I’ve got nothing telling me I can’t  cap some old fucking—” he stopped.  Minoru smiled, and Mai could  swear she heard him murmur, <em>gotcha. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you’re taking these kids somewhere, I’m coming.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Request  confirmation,” the soldier said, again not to Minoru.  A moment’s  tense pause, and then, “Employer consents under the condition that  you agree to a buy-out, and that you surrender your firearms to us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He  planning on giving them back? I’m attached to them, and they cost  quite a bit of money.”  For one wild second, Mai saw it clearly in  her mind, clear as day: The sergeant refusing, and Minoru shouting  that that did it, he wasn’t going and this meant <em>war</em>, and  then pulling his pistol, and then—</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“After  the contract has been bought and you’re clear. Now come with us.  Please.” The last was spoken with a certain reluctance, a sort of  petulance, and Mai realized that Minoru had been right—the sergeant <em>was </em>just a kid. A well-trained kid, maybe, but a kid.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  said, “Let me consult my…” and then stopped, frowning.  “Um.  Give me a minute.”  The soldier said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Turning  to them, Minoru said, “I’ll say it frankly, I don’t like it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  hell do you care?” It was Yuuichi who spoke, surprisingly enough,  his voice as rough as his speech.  “You’re here on <em>contract</em>,  anyway, and they’re buying.” Somebody murmured agreement, though  nobody else voiced it so openly.  “You’re full of shit is what  you are, and we don’t need your help.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I <em>was </em>here on contract,” Minoru said, brushing Yuuichi off like he  was nothing at all.  “<em>Was. </em>That’s when I was here watching  you kids brush your teeth through a sniper scope, like a spare few  mercs have been doing since.” He admitted it without shame nor  sheepishness, likewise taking no pride in what this implied.  Nobody  blushed nor protested, maybe because the situation was too imminent  to have a fit over something as trivial as maybe being seen in the  buff a few seconds by a seemingly asexual old man with a sniper  rifle. “Stopped being paid for what I’m doing a while back, and  I’m frankly in the same boat you are about now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  you’re just looking to save your own ass, then? Is that it? Or is  there something else you haven’t told us? Shit, we don’t even  know what kind of boat we’re <em>in.</em>” Yuuichi said, not to be  denied, and to his amazement, Mai spoke up in support of him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who…”  she murmured, her voice that of a powerful train just starting to  accelerate, and in that instant, Minoru knew he was in for a verbal  beating, and that if anybody was going to sway the group into tossing  him out and gunning it against the soldiers here, it was her.  “Who  the <em>hell </em>do you think you are? A perverted stowaway? Found you  in the back of our van, and you seem to have <em>heaped </em>trouble on  us since then, and nothing but. You take Shiho into the woods…<em>Shiho,</em>”  she said it like it meant something, and Minoru guessed that maybe to  the people who counted to her, it did, “of all people, and you have  Yuuichi…you have him practically clawing his eyes out with  worry…you <em>bring this kind of trouble on us, </em>you put us right  back where we were before…before <em>THEN, </em>and then you think  you can <em>SPEAK FOR US?</em>” She was, indeed a train. She was  practically screaming by now, her eyes wild and furious.  “You  think that you have some kind of right of dominance over us? Just  because you’re older? You have more guns? You think—” Yuuichi  cut her off, putting his hand on her shoulder and pulling her near to  him, glaring daggers at Minoru.  As far as they were concerned,  nothing had gone wrong until Minoru came along, which was, in some  ways, true. He found that he was receiving more than a few  glares—from the one with the blue eyes, Aoi, and from a couple, an  innocent-looking boy and a pretty, simple-looking girl, and from the  young one with the black hair.  It was her that scared him more than  the rest—protective, rather than offended. <em>You upset her, how  fucking dare you?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Get  the fuck out,” Yuuichi hissed, and the others nodded.  “Get out  and take these fucking soldiers with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  was at a loss—he hadn’t expected <em>this. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  Shizuru murmured, and suddenly, the attention shifted to her.  She  was the one who had practically fainted into Natsuki’s arms, naked  and shaken.  It would have been the same as if Chie, still a little  shell-shocked, had spoken up. “Please. He’s right,” she said.  “This is bad. All of this is bad. We need to go, and we need to go  now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki,  next to her, nodded. “Please, listen to her. I don’t know if you  know what kind of shit we’re in, but—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  you’re about to find out,” Minoru whispered, his eyes no longer  focused on the group, but behind them.  To the woods.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To the  fucking <em>woods.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Fucking  delusional tree-hoppers. Why the </em>fuck <em>did you think they could  keep the woods safe?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  fucking woods.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Now  he turned and spoke to the soldiers. “I think you got yourself a  deal, boys, and I hope to hell you have a good goddamn piece of  backup here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  soldiers weren’t listening. They were staring at the woods too, and  raising their weapons.  Minoru heard the muffled sounds of speech,  not directed at him but at each other, over a private link, probably.  Within a few seconds, other soldiers started to move over the ridge,  but fast.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  turned back to the group. Natsuki had spotted what he’d seen. So  had Reito, and so had Midori.  None could find it in them to speak.  The soldiers they’d encountered first began to move towards them  quick.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stay  back!” Yuuichi shouted. “We don’t want any part of—”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tate  needs to be quiet,” Mikoto said quietly, now turning to face the  woods too.  “We need to leave.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What…”  Mai turned to face where Mikoto was staring, and then she gasped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">From the  woods, what seemed to be a dark blob was advancing towards them  quickly, like a charred, vengeful amoeba. Looking closely, one could  see that it was not some amorphous, asexual, slightly crispy entity,  but a line.  A line of people.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A line  of soldiers. Dressed in black, like the first, but their weapons were  different. Longer.  Not that that meant much to Mai.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Advancing  very, very quickly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now  that we’ve spent all our leeway time speaking, I think we’re  going to have to run,” Chie whispered, and now they <em>did </em>all  turn to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  nodded. “Move, kids. Move now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That was when the first  shots rang out from the line. A trio of <em>crack crack cracks</em> was  all; nothing that would seem threatening until two pockets of dirt  kicked up around the sergeant.  The third shot, it would seem, found  its mark, and he dropped with a muffled cry.  A pair of soldiers  grabbed him before he had time to hit the ground and started dragging  him, and Minoru shouted it this time: <em>“RUN!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  ran.  All of them, at once, with the frantic panic that Minoru was  sure he could witness at the beginning of a cattle stampede if he had  the occasion to incite one himself.  The soldiers, young perhaps, but  professional, moved aside and advanced, raising their weapons and  opening fire, their guns <em>crack crack crack</em>ing like the others  had.  The weapons were silenced, no noisier than the rapping of a  fist on a table, but somehow, they seemed infinitely louder, more  deafening, at least to Mai, who wasn’t really seeing them at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was  seeing herself running. Running after Takumi and Akira.  Running  after the girl next to her; that sweet, evil little fucking girl with  her little pigtails and her enormous sword. That fucking…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">People  were starting to die around her. As they passed the first line of  soldiers, they formed a line around the group, shielding them, dying  as per terms of their contract.  People were shouting, and they were  dying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Dying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Dying  because of<em><br />
  SHE’S  RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.<br />
  KILL  HER NOW, BEFORE SHE KILLS TAKUMI. BEFORE SHE KILLS YUUICHI<br />
  YOU  FUCKING WEAKLING, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU’RE</em><br />
  A  pair of strong arms gripped her before she knew she was falling.  Before she knew she’d fallen behind, started just standing there,  maybe expecting to start floating. Maybe expecting something to rise  up out of the ground.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minoru  had her around the waist. She was light—light as hell, actually. He  wondered briefly whether he’d see flesh or simply rib if she simply  disrobed right now. He was strong—it was hard to climb trees with a  five kilogram backpack and <em>not </em>be strong—but it honestly  felt for a moment, as he picked her up, that he was only lifting air.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He  didn’t know it, but for a moment, he was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  world came rushing back around Mai, and Yuuichi was screaming her  name; he’d practically tripped over himself, whipping around as  soon as he realized Mai was no longer nearby—Mikoto was already  tearing the sand up sprinting back towards her. Shots were starting  to echo near them now, and Mai could hear the distant hum of a  helicopter. A black-clad man not a meter away from them screamed,  clutching at an invisible lead-bug bite in his throat, and dropped to  the ground.  People were shouting, voices muffled but still obviously  frightened and angry all at once.  Something exploded nearby—a  grenade, but Mai didn’t know it—and Mikoto grabbed Minoru by the  hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  need to move,” she said simply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  need to tell me, kid,” Minoru said. “Get moving. I’ve got this  one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  started to get heavier of a sudden, and Minoru murmured to her, “Can  you walk?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mai  didn’t know, but she knew Minoru was about to drop her. Up ahead of  them, Natsuki had now noticed them, stopped, and started back for  them as well, drawing a pistol and snapping shots off at the  advancing line of soldiers.  Minoru had no idea if she hit anybody or  not—the cries were getting too constant now.  She reached them  shortly, and shouted, “Is she okay?” as loud as she could to be  heard over the battle around them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Think  so. Help me carry her.” Minoru, it seemed, had no trouble making  himself heard in the middle of a warzone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  grabbed her legs. Mai didn’t protest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Together,  they made it up over the hill in only a few seconds. The others were  already there, and as soon as they were clear of the battlefield, the  soldiers began to retreat—a convoy’s worth of unmarked,  plain-looking vans waited for them there, and they were quickly  ushered into the spacious interior of one of them.  They were moving  less than twenty seconds later—true military efficiency, even if  their possible saviors weren’t military, per se.  They rode in  utter silence, none of them entirely ready to look at anybody else  yet.  Mai rested lightly in Yuuichi’s arms, her eyes half-open, and  it was that girl that Minoru thought on then.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Because,  for a second there, it had really felt like she was just floating.</span></p>

A/N:
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Short as  hell, I know.  This is meant to be a transitional chapter, you could  say, between the first and second parts of this story; the first and  second story arcs, if you will, a la School Rumble.</span></p>
