<p>The  interrogation, or beating as Natsuki would call it from her end, had  lasted about half an hour, and the captain, a Mr. Remy Bardas, was  quite furious at the girl’s stubborn silence, his bloodied hand serving  as clear evidence to his frustration.</p>
<p>Bardas was a middle-aged  fellow, most likely in his mid to upper thirties, Natsuki assumed, whom  had been sent in from the capital to replace the man the raven-haired  girl had assassinated just days before, and apparently he wasn’t too  happy about leaving the luxury of Seris to have to brave the wilderness  and harsh weather conditions of Southern Vedel in the spring. His anger  towards his current situation he had unleashed upon the  eighteen-year-old who had taken every blow with barely even a grunt,  even as the taste of iron filled her mouth and the bruises accumulated  over her body. Natsuki knew it was only a matter of withstanding the  blows for now, the nano-machines coursing through her blood would heal  them easily enough with time, but not even she had expected what  happened next.</p>
<p>The captain had disappeared for several minutes,  in which Natsuki was left bound to her chair with two foot soldiers  standing watch nearby, when he finally came bursting back through the  tent’s entrance, making his way around the chair to face the girl, a  rapier in hand.</p>
<p>“Do you know what this is?” he agitatedly  questioned her, snaking the weapon in front of her, and she took note  that the pommel seemed to be glowing oddly.</p>
<p>“This,” the man  continued, “is the Brandishiér, an antique rapier from the days of  Vedel’s origin. Granted it isn’t the only one of it’s kind, but it  still holds sentimental value to me since it’s been passed down from  generation to generation in my family. I always carry it when I leave  for battle…A good luck charm perhaps...”</p>
<p>“<em>What are you getting at…”</em> Natsuki thought to herself as the man continued to ramble.</p>
<p>“And  this,” Bardas stated, shoving the end of the sword in Natsuki’s face,  the heat it emitted causing her to draw her head back, “is the old  Vedelian symbol <em>“</em><em>indignus</em><em>”</em>…Although there is no  precise word matching it in today’s tongue, it would roughly translate  to unworthy scum of the earth, which is exactly what you Resistance  bastards are.”</p>
<p>Using his free hand to grab a fistful of Natsuki’s  hair, the captain yanked her head to the left before driving the heated  pommel of the sword into the right side of the girl’s neck, and this  time, Natsuki couldn’t contain the scream that formed in her throat as  the hot metal burned her flesh.</p>
<p>With a devious grin, Bardas spoke  again, his voice rising over the anguished screams, tone full of  vicious excitement, “Back in the day, this sword was used by the Nobles  to mark disobedient slaves, petty criminals, murderers, and those who  betrayed their country and king. It’s very befitting of you, don’t you  think?”</p>
<p>“S-Sir, you’re drawing blood, sir,” one of the soldiers stuttered, obviously disturbed with the scene.</p>
<p>Bardas  snarled, and with a huff, drew back, the mark on the girl’s neck still  steaming as the tent was filled with the stench of burning flesh.  Taking her face in his hand, the noble forced her to look at him.</p>
<p>“Be thankful that this <em>pansy</em> has sympathy for even a dog like you. Take her back outside,” the man commanded, and then hastily disappeared out of the tent.</p>

“<em>So there still hasn’t been any word on either of them?”</em>
<p>“I’m afraid not,” Lucretia replied, switching the phone receiver to  her left ear, holding it with her shoulder so she continue writing.</p>
<p>“<em>This truly is unfortunate…”</em> Anya commented,<em> “Both girl’s disappearing like this…”</em></p>
<p>“I haven’t completely given up hope yet.”</p>
<p>“<em>But what if they don’t come back? Won’t your plan will be useless without both of them?”</em></p>
<p>“That’s  not entirely true,” the second Column remarked, “Although Tokiha showed  signs of becoming an exceptional Otome, as much as I hate to say it, I  think she can be replaced easily enough.”</p>
<p>There was a pause on the line before Anya spoke again, <em>“What makes you have so much confidence in </em><em><strong>her</strong></em><em>? Do you really think she’d be able to handle that kind of pressure?”</em></p>
<p>The older woman couldn’t help but smirk, “I think <em>she</em> might be the only one who can. Besides, I’m not the only one who has confidence in her abilities…”</p>

<em><strong>Three months ago…</strong></em>
<p>“<em>She might have been chosen by the Shinso, but that doesn’t make  her the best choice,” Mizuki Granger argued, slamming her fist down on  the table the five women were currently situated around.</em></p>
<p><em>All  five of the Columns had been summoned to Garderobe to discuss the  latest candidates for possible future replacements, only for that  discussion to quickly turn into a heated debate. </em></p>
<p><em>Lucretia  Oleander, often considered the unofficial leader of the group, silently  sat back in her chair listening to the women throw arguments back and  forth across the table, Anya by her side looking quite nervous and  unsure of what to do. It was the remaining three who were causing the  uproar that, by the looks of it, wasn’t about to end any time soon.</em></p>
<p>“<em>What is it that you have against Natsuki? She </em><em><strong>is</strong></em><em> the current Pearl number two. Isn’t that proof enough that she’s  capable of handling the job as well? She’s undeniably the best fighter  of the two.” Shizuru shot back.</em></p>
<p>“<em>But fighting isn’t the  only aspect of being a Column,” Xiang Yu, wielder of the Break String  Spinel commented, “A Column must excel in </em><em><strong>all</strong></em><em> aspects of being an Otome, and Mai Tokiha has proved this during her time here at Garderobe.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Just  because she has the highest numbers doesn’t mean she’s the best. Ask  the girls in their class, most of them will say that Natsuki is the  better Otome.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>What do those girls know?” Mizuki snapped, “You’re just biased towards Kruger because you have feelings for—“ </em></p>
<p>“<em>That has nothing to do with this!”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Like hell it doesn’t!”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Stop  it you two,” Lucretia finally intervened, and both the Galactic  Aquamarine and the Bewitching Smile Amethyst complied, although they  were still seething.</em></p>
<p>“<em>What are your opinions on this matter, Lucretia?” Xiang calmly asked the older woman.</em></p>
<p><em>The number two Column closed her eyes, “I haven’t quite decided yet.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Anya?” Mizuki eagerly questioned.</em></p>
<p>“<em>I-I don’t know…” the woman stammered, taking a quick glance at the Gakuenchou.</em></p>
<p><em>The young number one Column huffed, “I think Xiang should choose, I mean, it is her position that’s being filled.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>That isn’t fair, the replacement is someone we’re all going to have to work with,” Shizuru was quick to counter.</em></p>
<p><em>Mizuki eyed the chestnut-haired girl wearily, “If Norah was still here…”</em></p>
<p>“<em>I said that’s enough!” Lucretia threatened.</em></p>
<p><em>Silence filled the room for a time, no one daring to look at the other even though the tension was still present.</em></p>
<p>“<em>It  seems like there are two votes for Mai Tokiha and one for Natsuki  Kruger. As for Anya and myself, we’re both impartial. Both are worthy  candidates, so either would be a fine choice, but respecting the  group’s decision as a whole, Mai Tokiha will be our new Break String  Spinel wielder.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>But Oleander-sama—!”</em></p>
<p>“<em>That is my final decision, Miss Viola. End of discussion.”</em></p>

<strong>Chapter Notes</strong>:
<p>1. <em>Indignus </em>is actually Latin for unworthy.</p>
<p>2. I don’t  really have a clear-cut vision of what the mark looks like. I just  imagine it being about the size of a U.S. silver dollar, the symbol  itself being inside of a circle.</p>
<p>3. Just for reference, this is the age line-up for the Columns: Lucretia, (Norah), Xiang, Anya, Mizuki, Shizuru</p>
