<h1>Friendship</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../claymore/index.html">Claymore</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The rough, rocky hills stretched around them as Clare
and Raki walked along, Clare&#39;s short blonde hair
blowed faintly in the breeze as she explained grimly
the nature of her and her fellow warriors, and the
fact that their part yoma nature would finally
overwhelm them and turn them into monsters themselves.

Holding her massive sword in her hands Clare&#39;s skirt
fluttered around her legs as she concluded, &quot;When we
know that our human mind has reached it&#39;s limit and
we&#39;re sure we&#39;re about to turn monster...&quot;

Raki gulped, the young boy shaken by the intensity in
Clare&#39;s eyes.

&quot;We make up our minds to die as a human being and send
the black card to the one we want to be killed by,&quot;
Clare finished, her cape snapping in the breeze.

Raki looked at her a moment, then the boy clad in
simple peasant&#39;s garb quietly asked, &quot;Then who sent
you that card?&quot; He hesitated as he dared ask, &quot;Do you
know them?&quot;

Clare nodded slightly and answered, &quot;Her name is
Elena, we joined the organization at the same time.&quot; A
surprising gentleness tinged her voice as she
remembered, &quot;We comforted each other in our darkest
hours, when our bodies were transforming and were
wracked with pain and we&#39;d... hold each other at night
so we could get some sleep.&quot;

The sound of a nearby footstep drew their gaze up, and
Raki gasped softly in surprise. If he had been
expecting anything it was a inhuman monster, a
creature hiding it&#39;s true nature as a man, but the
woman who was waiting for them was nothing like that.
She looked even a bit more feminine than Clare, with
long blonde hair flowing over her shoulders and gentle
eyes despite the massive weapon she casually carried
in one hand.

&quot;Hello Clare,&quot; she smiled, the breeze lifting her
hair, &quot;it&#39;s been a long time.&quot;

&quot;Elena...,&quot; Clare said softly, &quot;you haven&#39;t changed.
You look just like you did back then.&quot;

Raki was surprised to hear pain in Clare&#39;s voice,
coming from the warrior who seemed to fight so hard to
contain her emotions.

&quot;I thought you&#39;d be more distorted by now,&quot; Clare
added sadly.

&quot;I&#39;m forcing it back to meet with you,&quot; Elena
admitted, her voice rough with emotion. &quot;How long has
it been?&quot; she mused, &quot;It feels like ages, but I
remember it like yesterday... there was so much pain,
but for some reason I can only remember the good
times.&quot;

&#39;I do, too,&#39; Clare thought as she closed her eyes a
moment, fighting back tears...

In the dorms where children preparing to join the
organization rested, there were soft groans of pain as
their flesh and blood adapted to the presence of yoma
within them. Elena was wracked with pain, shuddering
on the cramped bed and groaning softly.

&quot;Elena,&quot; Clare murmured, the brown haired young woman
climbing in bed beside her, her own body hurting in
ways she could barely imagine.

Elena grabbed on to her, shuddering as she clutched
with a nearly inhuman strength. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she
managed weakly.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Claire murmured, glad to have
something other than her own pain to focus on. She
stroked the other girl&#39;s hair, remembering how it had
felt to touch Teresa&#39;s hair, when she was younger.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Elena murmured, looking up to meet
Clare&#39;s eyes with ones that were already showing signs
of silver. In a swift motion she pulled them closer,
kissing Clare fiercely.

&quot;Elena?&quot; Clare looked at her questioningly.

&quot;I need this,&quot; Elena said as she kissed her again
fiercely, &quot;please Clare...&quot;

Clare moaned softly, knowing that she couldn&#39;t resist,
that her own deep need to touch and be touched was
rising to the surface. Pulling her closer she let her
hands roam freely over Elena&#39;s body as they kissed
wildly, then nibbled at her sweet throat.

&quot;Oh Clare,&quot; Elena gasped, arching her back as
pleasurable sensations rippled through her body. She
tugged at her loose, plain grey garment, pulling it
aside to reveal more flesh for Clare&#39;s fevered tongue
to caress.

Clare slid down willingly to find a pointed nipple,
clasping her lips around it as Elena gave a breathy
moan that made Clare shiver. &quot;You sound so beautiful
when you do that,&quot; she confessed as she wetly kissed
her other breast.

&quot;Please. Let me touch you...&quot; Elena tugged weakly on
Clare&#39;s arms as she lay sprawled beneath the other
girl

Willingly Clare let the other girl pull her top away,
shivering as cold air made her nipples get hard. Even
as Elena lunged for her body Clare held her back,
swiftly helping the other girl undress too until their
clothes rested in a pile by the bed. Slim naked forms
slid together as they gazed into each other&#39;s eyes
once more.

Clare fought back a moan as her nearly hairless body
rubbed across Elena&#39;s. &quot;It&#39;s better than I had
imagined,&quot; she shuddered as they moved smoothly
together.

Elena rolled on her back, spreading her legs even as
she brought her hands to Clare&#39;s ass. &quot;Harder,&quot; she
gasped, &quot;please...&quot;

Ignoring her aches and pains Clare did so, their
bodies wielded together by passion as they churned and
rocked wildly on the rough bed. Almost as one they
reached the peak, each fighting to keep the sounds of
their passionate cries muffled.

&quot;That was wonderful,:&quot; Clare finally managed, to get
out laying limp and exhausted on top of Elena.

Elena smiled, snuggling close as they lay there, the
sweat cooling on their young bodies. &quot;Stay with me?&quot;
she softly asked in Clare&#39;s ear.

&quot;Always,&quot; Clare smiled back tiredly as both women
drifted off to a exhausted sleep.

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Elena met her eyes, and Clare could almost feel the
memories they shared pass between them. &quot;I started
this job after you,&quot; Elena mused thoughtfully, &quot;I
never thought I&#39;d end up like this before you.&quot;

Raki gulped, knowing what was coming as his eyes
widened...

&quot;I thought that taking on the yoma&#39;s power would give
me strength,&quot; Elena reflected, &quot;but to control it, you
have to have a strong human heart.&quot;

&#39;Oh Elena,&#39; Clare thought, feeling her own heart
break.

&quot;So please... hurry!&quot; Elena met her eyes as tears
streaked her cheeks, &quot;Finish it, while my heart is
still human.&quot;

And ignoring Raki&#39;s tearful pleas, Clare did so.

End

Notes: Dialog before and after the flashback is taken
from Claymore volume one manga. I was inspired by the
description &quot;We comforted each other in our darkest
hours, when our bodies were transforming and were
wracked with pain we&#39;d... hold each other at night so
we could sleep.&quot; It seemed oddly tender for Clare at
that point, and I thought it might imply something
more between them.
