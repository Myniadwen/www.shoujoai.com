<h1>Save the Queen (part 5 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff9/index.html">Final Fantasy  9</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/gliph.html">Gliph Tsy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff9/savequeen-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Beatrix climbed the rope fighting the elements as she climbed. The rain 
poured down on her heavily showing no sign of stopping. She also had to 
fight the pain in her arm. She felt a slight pain as each drop of icy 
rain made contact with the skin.

After much persistence she climbed in through the window. Garnet stood 
waiting for her return. As Beatrix walked through the window. She was 
greeted by a pleasant smile from Garnet. She fell and Garnet held her 
in her arms.

Garnet noticed the wound and told Beatrix to sit on the bed. She went 
into her bathroom and got a bottle of rubbing alcohol.  Putting some on 
a cloth she re-entered the bed room.

She sad beside Beatrix.

&#39;This will sting a bit&#39;

Beatrix was thankful that she spoke. Although it was obvious what 
rubbing alcohol on an open wound  would do. She like to hear her voice.

After she treated the wound. Garnet smiled at Beatrix.

Slowly she removed the pink ribbon from her hair and tied it around the 
wound. The ribbon helped hide the wound and looked beautiful against 
the colour of Beatrix&#39;s skin.

Garnet began to rub beatrix&#39;s shoulder. There was a pause. For a few 
moments the only noises heard where those of the storm.  Suddenly the 
storm stopped and it was warm one more.

Beatrix sat and admired the beauty of the Queen. Her mind drifted back 
to the conversation she had with Eiko.

&#39;Tell her&#39; These words of Eiko&#39;s rang through her head.

Her mind drifted back further.

Back to when she was a Knight in training.

&#39;Oh Beatrix. I love you!&#39; The childhood Garnet said. She giggled and 
kiss Beatrix on the cheek.

Various Quotes of Garnet from the past drifted through her head.

&#39;When I grow up I wan&#39;t to be just like you&#39;

&#39;You&#39;re so beautiful&#39;

&#39;I love you&#39; She heard it again.  &#39;I love you&#39;  Again. &#39;I love you&#39; 
Once more. &#39;I love you&#39;

She heard Eiko speak.

&#39;Tell her&#39; The voice echoed. &#39;Tell her&#39; &#39;Tell her&#39; &#39;Tell her&#39;.

She returned to the real world.

She looked at Garnet in all her beauty.

She gulped.

It was now or never.

&#39;Garnet, I love you&#39; As Beatrix muttered the words &#39;I love you&#39; 
Garnet&#39;s mouthed the words. 

&#39;I love you too. I just , I just didn&#39;t know how to say it. You have 
been my heroine before and throughout this whole thing.&#39;

Beatrix smiled.

At the same time they both spoke. They said &#39;I love you&#39; 
simultaneously. Finally they both had the courage to admit their 
feelings to each other. Even the most legendary of Heroes have to 
struggle to find the courage to say those three words.

They looked at each other staring seductively.

Garnet placed her hands on Beatrix. She slowly unbuttoned her shirt. 
She placed the shirt aside. Beatrix slowly pulled Garnet&#39;s night gown 
over her head. When the night gown was removed Garnet shook her head 
from side to side allowing her dark hair to bounce.

The began to undress each other.

Garnet was now sitting in a small bra and her panties. The Alexandrian 
gem, The Falcon claw. Rested above her small breasts.

Beatrix sat in nothing but panties and her trademark eye patch.

Beatrix moved close.

She brushed her hand against Garnet&#39;s soft face moving a few stray 
strands of hair that were hanging over her face. She moved close. She 
went for a kiss but paused during the action. Garnet gave her a 
reassuring nod and Beatrix moved her head once more. They both closed 
their eyes. Their lips made contact.  The two just sat with their lips 
together. Garnet was first to move. Her mouth opened and Beatrix 
followed her lead. They began to kiss passionately. Garnet gave little 
moans of pleasure between lip movements. Beatrix enjoyed hearing the 
moans as it was a constant reminder that this was not a dream, it was 
real.

They kissed forever. Beatrix broke the kiss. She kissed her cheek and 
moved to her neck. Garnet continued her small moans of pleasure as her 
neck was being kissed. 

Beatrix began to massage Garnet&#39;s breasts as she kissed her neck. She 
moved her hand from Garnet&#39;s breasts. She paused when she reached her 
heart. She could feel the increased heart rate of the Queen. She was 
enjoying this as much as Beatrix was. Garnet reached to touch Beatrix&#39;s 
heart too. Beatrix returned to Garnet&#39;s lips. The kissed once more 
whilst feeling each other&#39;s heart beats. Beatrix moved her hand slowly 
down past the Queen&#39;s breasts and down to her abdomen. Beatrix broke 
this kiss. They both opened their eyes. Beatrix looked at Garnet and 
was given a pleasing nod. Garnet grabbed the back of Beatrix&#39;s head 
forced their lips together.

The delicate hand of Beatrix slipped itself under the Queen&#39;s 
underwear. She felt a slight dampness. If the heartbeat didn&#39;t prove 
how much Garnet was enjoying this, the wet patch surely did. 

As Beatrix touched the Queen&#39;s clitoris Garnet released a small noise.

&#39;Ungh!&#39; She moaned.

The Queen made this little noise due to the feeling of a finger on the 
sensitive organ.

The kiss was once more broken.

&#39;Should I stop?&#39;

&#39;No!&#39; Garnet yelled lustfully as she forcefully pulled Beatrix into a 
kiss.

Beatrix began to teasingly rub Garnet&#39;s clitoris slowly. 

She enjoyed hearing the soft moans Garnet emitted with each finger 
movement.

Beatrix slowly built up the speed of her finger movement. Garnet 
clenched Beatrix&#39;s free hand. She grabbed Beatrix&#39;s hand tightly. Her 
moans grew more intense. They grew louder.

Garnet released incredibly loud screams of pleasure.

She made these noises as she came to orgasm. She felt a flow of 
pleasure shoot through her body. 

The bond between their lips was broken once more.

Beatrix slowly moved her head. She pulled her head down by Garnet&#39;s 
breast as her beautiful silky hair tickled the Queen&#39;s body. 

She now lay at the Queen&#39;s crotch. She removed Garnet&#39;s underwear 
slowly dragging her panties down past her legs. She spread the Queen&#39;s 
legs and moved her head in between them. She reached for the Queen&#39;s 
hand. As she held her hand she began to perform oral sex on Garnet. 
Keeping a similar technique to that of her fingers she began to slowly 
stroke her clitoris with her tongue. She built up the Queen&#39;s pleasure 
which she could feel through Garnet&#39;s tight grip. Garnet&#39;s pleasure 
grew, her grip became stronger and stronger until her body fell to the 
power of yet another orgasm. She screamed Beatrix&#39;s name many times 
until the sensation began to fade.

Beatrix gave her another kiss. Just resting her lips on Garnet&#39;s.

She began to use her finger one Garnet once more as Dagger stroked her 
large breasts. Garnet moved her hand down through Beatrix&#39;s panties and 
began to pleasure her. The two used a similar technique. Garnet closely 
followed Beatrix&#39;s speed. The two got faster and faster with their 
fingers. The two moaned in ecstacy as they came to orgasm  
simultaneously. Still kissing, they kicked the satin sheets off the bed 
and held each other close sharing their body heat.

&#39;Beatrix, I love you&#39; Garnet said lovingly.

&#39;I love you more&#39; Beatrix replied filled with emotion.

The two Angels fell asleep in each other&#39;s arms.

Epilogue.

The next day.

A ray of light shone through the window. It shone across the soft skin 
of the two sleeping beauties. 

There was a few knocks on the door and no answer. Becoming worried the 
Pluto Knight taht the Queeb wasn&#39;t awake by seven, he forced the door 
open.

He entered the room. He couldn&#39;t help but notice that the Queen and 
Beatrix were asleep, hugging and partially naked.

Being sure not to wake them up he exited the room.

He met Adelbert Stiener in the hallway.

&#39;Sir, I just saw the Queen and Beatrix. They we....were...&#39;

He was cut off by Stiener&#39;s louder voice.

&#39;You should wash your mind out! They were just comforting each other!&#39;

His eyes were wide open and he was in a state of shock.

There was a long pause.

&#39;Oh&#39;
