<h1>Save the Queen (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff9/index.html">Final Fantasy  9</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/gliph.html">Gliph Tsy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff9/savequeen-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>The day of the festival had finally arrived . 

Waking up that morning Garnet and Beatrix didn&#39;t talk about the kiss. 
It seemed both of them wanted to say something but lost the ability to 
talk about the subject.  They passed the afternoon as usual just 
missing out on the subject.

The trap was set. 

Garnet was sitting on a throne placed upon a large podium. At this time 
an announcer called out the names of the participants.

&#39; Xirtaeb Sevol Tenrag , Weapon of choice; Axe. 
Gliph Tsy, Weapon of choice; Double sided sword. 
Tsul Nedibrof, Weapon of choice; Battle Gloves. 
Freya Crescent, Weapon of choice; Dragoon Lance.
Masa Mune, Weapon of choice; Bow and arrow.&#39;

Garnet was pleased to see her old friend Freya once more and relieved 
to see that they had found the assassin.

Before the Hunt started Masa was apprehended.

&#39;Let the Hunt begin!&#39; The anouncer yelled.

The hunt was filled with the usual killing of monsters for prizes, 
Garnet didn&#39;t exactly like it but she couldn&#39;t fight seven hundred 
years of tradition.

The final score was. Xertaeb- Twenty points, Gliph-  nine-teen 
points,Tsul twenty-three points. The winner was Freya by an amazing  
points thirty-seven points.

Garnet was more than happy to present the two-thousand Gil and Draken 
Lance to her Friend.

&quot;Hello, Dagger!&quot;  Freya expressed her joy with a smile.

&quot;Hello, Freya. I haven&#39;t seen you in months.&quot;

&#39;You almost missed me, I was in Lindblum until I was told the festival 
had been moved to Alexandria. It was quite a shock&#39;

&#39;I&#39;m sorry about that&#39;

&#39;If I may, could I ask why that man was taken before the hunt?&#39;

&#39;It is believed he was plotting to kill me&#39;

&#39;Oh my!&#39;

&#39;Everything will be alright now, I have Beatrix by my side&#39; Garnet 
smiled at Beatrix.

Freya sensed something strange like chemistry between the Queen and her 
Personal Guard. She dismissed the thought instantly.

Garnet proceeded to give Freya her prizes. She accepted them with a 
courteous bow.

&#39;Will you be staying in Alexandria long?&#39; Garnet asked Freya.

&#39;Sadly not, I have to get back to Burmecia, back to Fratley.&#39;

&#39;I hope everything is well with you both.&#39;

&#39;Oh it is, Thank you for the gifts.&#39;

&#39;You earned them&#39;

Freya smiled and took a massive leap onto the air. She landed on a roof 
top and proceeded to jump from roof to roof. She disappeared into the 
distance.

The festivities continued as the Queen was taken back to the Throne 
Room.

She was the happiest she had been for weeks.

As Beatrix and Garnet sat in the Throne Room a Knight entered the room 
and gave Beatrix some bad news.

The knight left.

Beatrix slowly walked over to the Queen dreading the news.

&#39;Your Majesty&#39;

When Garnet heard Beatrix say &#39;Your Majesty&#39; she knew that something 
was wrong.

&#39;It&#39;s about the attacker. It isn&#39;t Masa Mune. He had no scar on his arm 
and the arrows were different&#39;

Garnet began to sob as her relief was shattered into a million pieces.

&#39;So they are still out there, waiting?&#39; She spoke as tears ran down her 
face.

&#39;I am afraid so but I will protect you, I will stop them&#39;

Beatrix hugged Garnet. She held Garnet as she cried more and more.

As the hours passed Beatrix continued to console her.

When the hours of night came Beatrix led her to the bedroom.

She let Garnet fall to the bed and rummaged through her chest of 
drawers to find a night gown.

She helped the Queen into it slowly, her body was hardly responding. 
The tears continued to pour. She once again hugged Garnet until the 
tears ceased to flow.

&#39;I will be right back, I must use the bathroom.&#39; 

Garnet nodded. Beatrix entered the bathroom.

Without Garnet or Beatrix knowing it a rope dropped outside of the 
window and a Monkey-like figure climbed down it.

The figure opened the window slowly. It crept over to the distressed 
Queen. In a few precisely timed movement the figure grabbed the Queen 
in a head lock.

&#39;Who..who..are you?&#39;

&#39;You know who I am&#39;

Beatrix was washing her hand when she heard Garnet speaking to some one 
in the next room. She noted that she was in distress.

She crept into the room to see the monkey-like being holding Garnet and 
rambling insanely.

She clubbed the attacker with the side of her blade.

It released Garnet. Quickly scrambling to it&#39;s feet it ran to the 
window and climbed down the rope hoping to lose Beatrix as it did once 
before.

Beatrix put her hand on Garnet&#39;s back.

&#39;Are you alright?&#39;

&#39;Yes, stop her!&#39;

Beatrix followed the being down the rope. The last time she had lost 
her. This time was different; a storm emerged from nowhere and a bolt 
of lightning illuminated the outer compound of the castle. The figure 
stood waiting for her.

The rain poured down, the last time Beatrix had seen rain this intense 
was in Burmecia where it never stops raining

&#39;Mikoto! Explain yourself!&#39; Beatrix yelled, she had to the rain was 
just too loud.

&#39;Explain? You want me to explain? Alright I&#39;ll explain! She did this, 
she killed him!! She let him die!!&#39; Mikoto yelled back.

&#39;You mean Zidane?&#39;

&#39;Yes, my brother. If she would have just said no, he wouldn&#39;t have 
entered that tree! He would still be alive!! He would still be here&#39;

&#39;You know that isn&#39;t true! He went by his own because he wanted too 
none of us could stop him!&#39;

&#39;Stop with your lies, They mean nothing to me! Zidane and Kuja are 
dead!! I am The Angel Of Death now!!&#39;

Beatrix was shocked at Mikoto&#39;s comment. There was no way to reason 
with this Genome. She would have to protect the Queen even if it meant 
taking another life.

&#39;Mikoto I am sorry, I do not wish to do this but you leave me no 
choice!&#39;

&#39;So be it but remember I am the Angel Of Death, I do not die, Death is 
my gift!&#39;

Beatrix raised her sword above her head and charged at Mikoto. Mikoto 
had the same monkey like agility as Zidane and dodged the swing of the 
sword easily. Mikoto jumped high into the air and threw her bow away as 
she soared. She landed clutching a single arrow and threw the rest 
away. She ran at Beatrix as she once more tried to slash at Mikoto with 
the sword. Mikoto jumped once more in an almost dragoon like fashion. 
She landed behind Beatrix and slashed her arm with the arrow. Beatrix 
winced in pain. In a fit of anger, rage took over her body. Beatrix 
instantly thew her body to the ground and kicked Mikoto&#39;s legs causing 
her to fall. In a martial arts fashion she flipped to her feet, she 
grabbed her sword and stood over Mikoto. The blade held close to her 
neck.

Alright.....alright...you win&#39; Mikoto said panting and in pain.

Feeling some sympathy for the poor girl Beatrix spoke to her.

&#39;I shall release you if you never return to this continent, If i ever 
see you again, I will kill you&#39;

&#39;Your terms are just and fair, I agree&#39; Beatrix allowed Mikoto to climb 
to her feet. Mikoto wandered into the darkness as Beatrix turned to 
return to the Castle.

Suddenly there was a sound that Beatrix had grown used to. A rip in the 
Air.

Beatrix grabbed a dagger she carried with her and threw it into the 
darkness as she threw her body to the ground. The arrow closely missed 
her, however the dagger didn&#39;t miss Mikoto. It struck her heart.

Beatrix climbed to her feet walked over to the fallen angel. She looked 
at the appearance of the beautiful girl and shook her head in pity.
