<h1>Mindful of Memories (part 7 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff9/index.html">Final Fantasy  9</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/imogene.html">Imogene</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff9/mindmem-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Voices from the corridor drifted into Rikku&#39;s sleep. She drifted quietly 
with the soft drawls and mumbles as they led the way back to 
consciousness. One or two words spiked out of the haze like a sharp 
thorn only to vanish again.

All of this in what, less than a week?

A memory floated past of looking up through stinging dirt-clogged eyes 
into Yuffie&#39;s face as she lay cradled in her arms.

How can it just be a week, it feels like forever.

&quot;Hey wake up! Wake up Rikku... they wanna talk to us. Sheesh, wake up 
wont you?!&quot;

Yuffie grabbed Rikku&#39;s shoulders and gave them a quick wriggle. Rikku&#39;s 
face stirred into a scowl. Yuffie suddenly found herself brushing 
Rikku&#39;s hair from her face, the heat from the girl&#39;s face seared into 
her hand and buzzed along her arm. Her mind considered the edge of the 
blankets that were tucked up under Rikku&#39;s bare arm and spoke to Yuffie 
in little giggling whispers &#39;If I just pull it down a little...just a 
little... she&#39;s only wearing that little thing... just a little...&#39;

Something tugged at her blankets. Rikku opened her eyes as Yuffie 
stumbled backwards.

&quot;Theywannatotalktousyouhavetogetupnowandmeetwithallthemlotoutthere!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Rikku forced herself upright and blinked at the fuzzy image of 
Yuffie as she staggered about the room throwing clothes at Rikku&#39;s bed.

&quot;Get Dressed! We&#39;re all going to the Island! I think. They were talking 
out there before. Harriet said to get dressed and we gotta meet them.&quot; 
Yuffie stopped her frantic organising and watched as Rikku clambered out 
of bed and stretched. She tried to ignore the sensations sweeping over 
her body and kicked at something on the floor. Rikku sighed and gathered 
her clothes up.

&quot;Well... I&#39;m off to have a shower. I&#39;ll meet you there okay?&quot;

Yuffie nodded, halting the words &#39;no time for a shower, you better dress 
here&#39; before they had a chance to slip out.

----------

Steiner stood behind a large sheet of paper, on which the drawing of the 
island had been supplemented with plans for their imminent arrival. He 
stretched out and drew, for good effect, another small dotted line 
showing where they planned to anchor the airship.

&quot;Of course we&#39;re going to be making numerous trips. We have to ascertain 
whether it&#39;s safe to land people there. We will also be awaiting advice 
from our medics as to your fitness, as you&#39;re both still recovering from 
the rescue.&quot;

Steiner folded another sheet of paper out over the top of the first. It 
was a closer view of where the cave had been before it had collapsed. 
&quot;This is where we will be excavating our entrance. This point here is 
accessible by land and we have three teams of five ready to work. Our 
equipment drops will be tomorrow landing the next day and two days 
hence. This... this is where we believe there to be the greatest risk, 
these... roots or something... according to the girls they were dormant 
but they&#39;ve shown up at night glowing like a bonfire. We&#39;re confident at 
the moment that if we work during the day and camp in the airship at 
night we&#39;ll be able to excavate the entrance in around a week.&quot;

Steiner looked back up at the Rikku and Yuffie; &quot;You&#39;re linked to this 
somehow so we&#39;ll be asking you to assist us in exploring the cave 
system. Any further excavations will be carried out at your request.&quot;

Rikku nodded. What else could they do but help.

Yuffie shrugged, &quot;We&#39;ll kick its arse.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t even know what &#39;it&#39; is yet, so be cautious.&quot; Beatrix warned. 
She pulled a small sheet of paper from a pile on the table and sighed, 
&quot;There&#39;ve been more reports of people going crazy. We don&#39;t know how 
many are due to this, however...&quot;

Steiner stood upright and glared at the two girls, &quot;You&#39;re training 
begins today, I&#39;ll show you to the training rooms. We have medics there 
to assess your skills. Please follow me.&quot;

----------

Eiko bounced up and down on her bed listening to the musical creaking of 
the metal springs. One arm was wrapped around a small pink cat plushie. 
&quot;They&#39;re not taking you away kitten, no way no how yeeeeeaaaaahh!&quot; Eiko 
sang to herself and hugged the toy to her face. It seemed to radiate a 
feeling of safety and kindness.

----------

A powerful stink of damp wood and creosote filled the corridor that led 
to the newly built training rooms. A big fire had been lit to warm the 
large rooms and to heat the saunas and the swimming pool. Rikku and 
Yuffie were taken to a room filled with an array of wooden blocks and 
posts, each one a different shape as though cobbled together by a child. 
The set was laid out in a huge grid on the floor.

&quot;What the heck is that?&quot; Yuffie kicked at one of the blocks. It made a 
sudden rattling motion that sent Yuffie reeling backwards, &quot;Argh! 
Yikes!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve discovered the secret to the training rooms, they&#39;re all run on 
steam and machinery. Each one reacts to your motions differently. To 
disable them you just have to hit them in the right places. Here,&quot; 
Steiner handed Yuffie a small metal staff, &quot;Have a go, try and knock out 
as many as you can.&quot;

&quot;Hah, okay, I&#39;ll bust the lot!&quot; Yuffie held the staff up and eyed the 
blocks with a determined leer. She swang at one of them and it rang out 
a dull thud, shuddering sideways. Yuffie grinned and opened her mouth to 
snap out a taunt but was stopped short as the whole array started to 
shudder into life.

&quot;Lookout Yuffie, they&#39;re all connected.&quot; Steiner said from the back of 
the room where he, Rikku and two fitness trainers.

&quot;Oh...&quot; Yuffie watched as the array of blocks changed, each block seemed 
to grow and change shape, one of which had posts swinging out sideways. 
Yuffie ducked under them just in time and swung the staff low to hit the 
thing in the middle. Another block wobbled it&#39;s way towards her and she 
noticed the grooves on the floor that they were riding in like train 
tracks. She tried to guess its movement and missed. The tracks were 
clicking and moving with the rest. Yuffie took a deep breath and swung 
again as something hit her arm. She cursed and leapt out of the way, 
already short of breath.

Rikku felt her muscles reacting to the blocks even from the back of the 
room. She wondered if it was allowed to yell hints at Yuffie. One of the 
trainers, a beefy man with long green hair, commented to the other, 
&quot;She&#39;s still weak. I heard her condition was quite bad when she was 
found.&quot;

The other trainer, a fit young lady, scribbled notes on a clipboard. 
&quot;She was quite weak with malnutrition. Skinny as a rake she is, look at 
her. Hardly anything on her at all.&quot;

Rikku jerked forwards as Yuffie was hit across the back by one of the 
block&#39;s &#39;arms&#39;. Yuffie gasped for air and staggered across the floor as 
though she were on the last of her legs.

&quot;Pull her out of there.&quot; Steiner ordered and pulled a lever on the wall 
down. The blocks shuddered to a stop. Yuffie staggered around a little 
more and looked back at the bystanders, &quot;Hey!&quot; she puffed, &quot;I could... 
still... take them on... just...&quot; she bent over and took some deep 
breaths. Biting pain in her side caused her to cry out &quot;Ahh!&quot; as she 
stood up again. &quot;I&#39;m fine!&quot; she countered and clobbered one of the 
blocks.

Steiner waved her back, &quot;You&#39;re still ... recovering.&quot; He tactfully 
avoided using the word weak.

Yuffie, panting and puffing, shook her head, &quot;I was the best. I was the 
best! I was the best...&quot;

Steiner interrupted, &quot;Yuffie these are our expert trainers, this is Elk 
and this is Skye.&quot;

&quot;How long had you been without proper food? Before they found you I 
mean,&quot; Elk asked.

&quot;Food? I was...&quot; Yuffie shrugged, she&#39;d been on her own for nearly six 
months. Sometimes food had been scarce but she could always steal 
something from somewhere. Her gaze fell to her feet, and she saw how 
skinny her legs were. Somehow it hadn&#39;t mattered back then.

&quot;You&#39;ll be back to the best in no time at all!&quot; Rikku chirped, &quot;You just 
need some more practise right?&quot;

Yuffie nodded without much enthusiasm. Skye shook her head, &quot;Takes a 
long time to get back into shape from a condition like that. You should 
take it easy for a while.&quot;

&quot;Get lost! As if! I have to go fight and that&#39;s what I&#39;m gunna do!&quot; 
Yuffie swang the staff and attacked one of the blocks, scattering it 
across the floor. Steiner took the staff from her skinny little hand.

&quot;You have plenty of time Yuffie.&quot; He handed the staff to Rikku and 
ushered her out into the array.

Yuffie huffed under her breath; Rikku was too much of a kitten to do any 
damage surely. Rikku eyed up her opponents as Steiner pulled the lever 
up. She steadied herself as they quivered with life.

&quot;Odd stance.&quot; Skye noted Rikku&#39;s queer posture, her knees almost 
knocking together. Rikku moved in a sudden streak and vanished. Yuffie 
gasped. One of the blocks scattered itself across the floor. Rikku 
landed on top of the next one and brought the staff down across the 
adjacent block, it crashed into the one next to it while Rikku leapt out 
of the way. She ducked, weaved and almost danced across the floor while 
the blocks did their utmost to avoid or hit her but none could get near 
her and none could escape.

Yuffie pressed herself back into the wall as her knees grew weak and 
fought for breath. Rikku leapt into the air like a cat, slammed the 
staff down on another block and ducked under another that had snuck up 
from behind. Yuffie shivered and a cold sweat washed over her face, 
Rikku turned and crashed the staff into another block, then turned again 
and leapt over another as it jolted forwards. Yuffie shuddered again as 
a hot rush of blood sent the room spinning. Her legs were sapped of 
their strength with every movement Rikku made. Each time Rikku disabled 
another block it sent fire into Yuffie&#39;s heart and she watched with a 
helpless gaze that she couldn&#39;t break, caught out of the dark by the 
blazing light that Rikku&#39;s skill cast. Her breath rushed from her lungs 
in a shaky &quot;Oh wow&quot;.

&quot;She&#39;s good.&quot; Skye noted. Rikku was lithe and faster than the highest 
setting on the dial that Steiner had turned all the way up. She weaved 
in and out with almost psychic ease, gracefully swiping everything in 
her way. She flicked the staff upwards under one of the blocks and sent 
one part flying into the air, &quot;Whoopsie!&quot; she squealed then turned to 
the onlookers and winked, flicking the staff across another block. She 
saw Yuffie staggering to the floor and stopped, ducked under a pole and 
ran toward her.


&quot;Yuffie? Are you okay?&quot; Rikku knelt down beside Yuffie and placed her 
arm around Yuffie&#39;s trembling shoulders.

Yuffie took a shaky breath, her shivering frame collapsed further as she 
gasped for breath. The room tilted and swayed. Rikku&#39;s arm pulled her 
close. The world disappeared and left Yuffie alone, overwhelmed by the 
feeling of Rikku&#39;s warm body, the smell of breakfast on her breath, the 
vivid image of her slamming the blocks into scattering debris, sparks 
collided in her mind and lost amongst them all Yuffie floated. Her gaze 
fixated on Rikku&#39;s face.

&quot;She&#39;s not fit to fight anything.&quot; Steiner commented. He sighed and 
turned the machinery off.

&quot;Who? Rikku?&quot; Skye asked.

&quot;Yuffie. Rikku, you&#39;re good. You can help Yuffie recover her strength.&quot; 
Steiner sighed.

&quot;Okay.&quot; Rikku answered from the distant place she had drifted to, pulled 
away from the world by Yuffie&#39;s relentless stare. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; She 
hauled Yuffie up a little and propped her up against the wall.

Yuffie curled her legs up and hugged her knees. The fire in her blood 
was white hot and it burned in strange places.

&quot;She might not need to fight physically... can she use magic at all?&quot; 
Elk asked Steiner, who shrugged and flicked his eyebrows at Rikku.

Rikku shrugged. &quot;Yuffie?&quot;

&quot;...&quot; Yuffie blinked and Rikku&#39;s image stayed burned in her mind, 
leaping like a cat over the wooden blocks. She kept her eyes closed so 
she could replay the memory over again, it sent surges of hot and cold 
through her body, burning and aching that almost hurt.

Rikku&#39;s eyes searched over Yuffie&#39;s body, her hands wrapped tight around 
her shoulders, &quot;Are you okay? Do you need help?&quot;

Yuffie, still out of breath and shaking, opened her eyes and once again 
looked into Rikku&#39;s, enchanted by their colour, her face, the way the 
light caught her hair, her lips ...I never knew she was so awesome.

Rikku felt all the words she knew float away as Yuffie stared, 
unblinking and silent. &#39;She&#39;s scared and too proud to admit it.&#39;

----------

&quot;Come on Eiko where did you get the toy?&quot; Garnet jolted sideways again, 
Eiko jolted the other way on the bed. She hugged the kitty toy close, 
&quot;Mine! Mine mine mine mine mine! One of the cooks gave it to me! The 
nurse did! It was ...&quot; Eiko dodged her mother again, Garnet leapt across 
the bed and collapsed.

&quot;Eiko, we just want to make sure you&#39;re safe... sweetie please.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with Kitten.&quot; Eiko hugged the toy again. The more 
she hugged the more it felt like something was hugging her back - 
hugging her very soul.

Garnet stood up and saw Eiko&#39;s teary little eyes, &quot;You poor little 
dear.&quot; Of course it must be hard for her...she doesn&#39;t really think of 
me as her mother. Poor little thing, never had a childhood did you Eiko.

----------

Rikku sat by Yuffie&#39;s side while the trainers checked her over, she 
watched from a distant corner of her mind safe from confusing emotions. 
A place she knew well. &#39;See, it&#39;s easy to forget about love.&#39; But even 
to think the word sent a little twinge of pain behind her eyes. A little 
bite out of her heart every time she thought, &#39;It&#39;s not like it would 
ever work out. The next snappy bloke to come along and she&#39;ll be all 
over him. Better to get it over with and go home. If I can ever get back 
home. Not that I want to go back home. Although I do.&#39;

&quot;She&#39;s fine.&quot; Skye pronounced. She scribbled in her clipboard again.

&quot;Can you set up a schedule, I&#39;ll go and see how the others are doing 
loading the airship.&quot; Steiner said. Skye nodded, &quot;Sure.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll say goodbye for the time being then ladies. Good luck with your 
training. I&#39;ll be back in three days to see how you&#39;ve gone. Don&#39;t 
overdo it.&quot; Steiner saluted the girls and strode toward the exit.

&quot;Um bye!&quot; Rikku waved back as he left the room.

&quot;Yeh... bye.&quot; Yuffie waved absently and smiled at Rikku again, a smile 
that seemed to just... appear there on its own. She&#39;s so cool.

----------

Eiko hugged her little kitten toy and looked back over her shoulder. She 
squeezed her eyes shut and blinked. She counted to three... but when she 
looked back the little ghost was still there. Eiko tilted her head and 
watched the little ghost for a moment. Why aren&#39;t I scared?

&quot;Dat&#39;s my Kitten,&quot; the little ghost, a girl younger than Eiko, pointed 
at the toy cat.

&quot;I found... how come you&#39;re here?&quot; Eiko turned the toy over and over in 
her hands. It seemed real enough. Why would a ghost girl have a toy cat?

&quot;You can keep her for a bit if you want. She&#39;s magic, she makes the 
nightmares go away.&quot; The little girl stood up and brushed out her frilly 
pink dress. Eiko screwed up her nose at it and squinted at the girl. She 
had just appeared there after Garnet had left, in the corner of the 
room, picking her nose.

&quot;I think I&#39;m sick. I don&#39;t feel very good.&quot; The little girl pouted and 
twisted a lock of her long brown hair round her finger.

Eiko huffed, &quot;Don&#39;t be silly! You look fine to me. How come you&#39;re here 
... or are you really in my head?&quot;

The girl shook her head and looked around Eiko&#39;s bedroom, &quot;Your room 
hasn&#39;t got many toys. How come you don&#39;t got many toys?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t ... I do... I did but they took them away.&quot;

&quot;How come? Were you bad? Mum just puts me in my room when I&#39;m bad. I got 
lots of toys. I got a hundred toys. I can count to a hundred. I can 
count past ten!&quot; The girl sighed and folded onto the floor. Her head 
rested on her arms as she sprawled out on the carpet. &quot;I feel sick!&quot;

&quot;How come? I&#39;ll get a doct... I&#39;ll ... do ghosts get sick?&quot;

The little girl closed her eyes and curled up into a little ball, &quot;I&#39;m 
scared!&quot; Eiko hesitated and then took a couple of steps forward. The 
girl whimpered a little and Eiko took a step back, her heart racing. 
What if it&#39;s a trick? Who is she anyway?

&quot;You can have your kitten back,&quot; Eiko took a few quick steps toward the 
little girl and thrust the little toy into her shivering arms. The girl 
hugged the kitten close and sniffed, &quot;Fanks.&quot;

&quot;Who are you?&quot; Eiko stepped back again and looked the girl over. She was 
unfamiliar in every way. The girl took a deep breath and sniffed, &quot;the 
bad dreams is coming to get me.&quot;

Eiko stepped back again, her back met something soft. She turned and 
fell backwards as a large black and indistinct figure pushed past. It 
wafted like a shadow and sent the hairs on Eiko&#39;s neck standing on end 
like static. She froze, stuck without a scream to break the sudden dead 
silence. The little girl lay motionless as the shadow approached her and 
stood at her side.

Eiko swallowed and tried to inhale, her chest was heavy and the floor 
pulled her down like a magnet. The shadow leaned over the girl and drew 
from itself a long silver sword; it swung through the air in silence and 
stopped just at the girl&#39;s neck. The girl whimpered and clung to her 
little kitten. The sword dug a little way into the girl&#39;s skin... and 
there it stayed for countless seconds. Then the shadow sighed and pulled 
the sword away. The little girl began to sob as the shadow walked away, 
fading into nothing...

Eiko gasped, coughed and clawed at the air for breath. She looked at 
where the girl had been lying, she&#39;d vanished with the shadow. Eiko 
crawled up onto the bed and wrapped her arms around the blankets on 
which a rain of hot tears made little dark spots.
