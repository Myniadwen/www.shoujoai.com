<h1>Save the Queen (part 2 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff9/index.html">Final Fantasy  9</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/gliph.html">Gliph Tsy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff9/savequeen-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The Queen&#39;s bedroom was iluminated. A bright ray of sunlight shone 
through the window, birds chirped outside and the soft wind made the 
tree branches rustle together. Instead of an irritable grouping of 
noises it was somewhat peaceful. The most beautiful thing in this 
already beautiful scene was the two Angels holding each other in the 
kingsize bed. Both asleep and in comfort.

Outside of the room however was not as quiet.

A stern faced man knocked loudly on the door. He waited a few seconds. 
He became increasing worried about the fact that Queen wasn&#39;t up and 
about she is usually up by six o&#39;clock it was now seven o&#39;clock.

He knocked again.

&#39;Your Highness!&#39; He yelled.

No answer.

&#39;Your Highness!&#39; He yelled louder than before.

&#39;Something is definitely wrong&#39; He thought.

He moved back from the door. Ready to build up some momentum. He made 
his move.

Any one in the vicinity would have heard.

Clank, clank, clank then Bang!

He had just charged through the expensively carved ebony door.

Beatrix and Garnet awoke obviously startled at the loud bang.  Beatrix 
moved her hand to the side of the bed where Save The Queen was lying.

She realized who the man was.

It was very embarrassed looking Adelbert Steiner.

&#39;You...Your..Hi..Hi..Highness..&#39; He looked to the ceiling. &#39;The... 
Regent..Is..Is..Is....&#39; He looked to the window.&#39; He..he is waiting for 
you to come to the me..meet.......gathering&#39; Steiner left the room 
feeling slightly uneasy about what he had just saw. He did just see a 
topless Beatrix and the Queen sharing a bed together, he had no idea 
what to think.

&#39;I better chase after him&#39; Beatrix spoke. She climbed out of the bed 
and hurriedly dressed.

As she was leaving the room she was stopped by Garnet&#39;s voice.

&#39;Beatrix&#39;

She turned to face the Queen. &#39;Yes?&#39;

&#39;Thank you for making me feel so safe and so comfortable&#39;

&#39;It&#39;s my honour&#39; She smiled.

She paused outside of the room.

She thought about what she had just said. 

&#39;It&#39;s my honour? Did i just say that? Good idea Bea sound bookish 
that&#39;ll impress her&#39;

&#39;Now, where did he go?&#39;

Clank clank clank. The noise came from the left corridor.

She ran to the corridor.

&#39;Steiner!&#39; She yelled.

He gained speed pretending not to hear her.

&#39;Steiner!&#39; She yelled louder.

He got faster.

&#39;Damn it!&#39; She thought. 

&#39;Adelbert Stiener!, I the Queen&#39;s personal guard!,  command you to 
halt!&#39;

He froze in his tracks. She ran to him.

&#39;Steiner!&#39; She grabbed him and turned him to face her.

&#39;Y..y..yes&#39; He stammered.

&#39;What are you so embarrassed about?&#39;

&#39;Y..yo..you and he..her&#39;

&#39;She was afraid! Another attempt had been made on her life last night. 
Did you know that? I was merely comforting her.&#39;

&#39;Oh, I didn&#39;t know. I apologize&#39; 

&#39;It is okay&#39; She smiled. &#39;If you see this again in future remember I am 
only making her feel secure. She&#39;s the Queen for goodness sake, she 
wouldn&#39;t behave like that and neither would i for that matter.&#39;

&#39;I understand, could you bring her to see the Regent?&#39;

&#39;I shall&#39;

&#39;Thank you&#39; 

He walked away armour still clanking. 

She felt upset about lying to Steiner but her feelings were on a need 
to know basis and he didn&#39;t need to know.
