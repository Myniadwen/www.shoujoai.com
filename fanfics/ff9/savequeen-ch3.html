<h1>Save the Queen (part 3 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff9/index.html">Final Fantasy  9</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/gliph.html">Gliph Tsy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff9/savequeen-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Beatrix entered the bedroom cautiously stepping over the door that 
Steiner had ran through. She looked around Garnet was nowhere to be 
seen. She wasn&#39;t in the room or on the balcony. Beatrix panicked and 
ran into the last place the Queen could be, the bathroom. 

&#39;Garnet?&#39; She asked as she entered the room.

Garnet was standing with a long towel wrapped around her. The towel was 
tied just above her small breasts. He hair was still soaked and drops 
of water were running down her body.

&#39;Oh, hello Beatrix&#39; Ganret replied in a happy tone.

&quot;You would never believe how embarrassed Steiner was&quot; She smiled. &quot;I 
had to chase him down the corridor just to get him to look at me&quot;

Garnet laughed.

&#39;I wonder why he was so embarrassed&#39; She said sarcastically smiled.

&#39;Did you see him? He didn&#39;t know where to look. I hope you sorted it 
out.&#39;

&#39;I did but he will probably be red for a week&#39;

Garnet laughed again.

&#39;Well I guess I&#39;d better get dressed. Would you mind waiting outside?&#39;

&#39;Of course.&#39;

Beatrix left the room. Looking for something to do she decided to make 
the bed. The bed; The bed she had slept in; the bed Garnet slept in; 
The bed they slept in.

As she spread out the bed sheets her mind treated her to flashbacks. 
She could see herself and the Queen in the bed. She could feel the soft 
touch of Garnet&#39;s skin, she could feel the warmth of her body. She felt 
safe. 

&#39;Beatrix!&#39; Garnet yelled.

Beatrix was released from her day dream.

&#39;Coming!&#39; She yelled.

She ran to the Queen&#39;s aid to find her wearing or to be more exact 
half-wearing an elegant gown. She couldn&#39;t zip the back of the dress by 
herself.

&#39;Beatrix, could you help me into this thing?&#39;

&#39;Of course I&#39;ll help you we can&#39;t have you walking around the palace 
like this now can we?&#39;

Garnet laughed and smiled at Beatrix.

&#39;Alright, let&#39;s see what we can do here&#39;

Beatrix slowly and steadily pulled the zipper up the dress taking as 
much care as humanly possibly to prevent Garnet&#39;s delicate skin being 
caught in the mechanism. When some one else tried to hurt the Queen she 
felt terrible but if she herself would have hurt the Queen in anyway 
even by something as minute as a slight nick with the zipper she would 
be consumed with guilt and hate herself.

Thankfully Beatrix managed to complete the task with no injuries what 
so ever.

With an unknown motivation Beatrix moved close to Garnet and place her 
head on her shoulders. She held the Queen&#39;s arms and spread them. 
Garnet could see herself in the mirror.

&#39;There&#39; Beatrix smiled. &#39;You look beautiful&#39; Beatrix paused. &#39;As 
always&#39;

&#39;I guess that makes two of us&#39;

 Beatrix couldn&#39;t believe the object of her affections had just called 
her &#39;Beautiful&#39; When just two days ago Beatrix thought she had no 
chance of gaining Garnet&#39;s affection.

She released the Queen&#39;s arms.

&#39;The Regent is waiting&#39;

&#39;I&#39;d be best to greet him as soon as I can&#39;

Beatrix nodded. She went into the bedroom and removed the arrow which 
almost took the Queen&#39;s life from the wall.

&#39;We may need this as evidence. I&#39;ll get some of the scientists to 
analyze it.&#39;

&#39;Good idea. Now we&#39;d better rush&#39;

Beatrix walked Garnet to the dinner room in close proximity of the 
Throne room.

She opened the doors and led the Queen inside. In the room there was 
two people one was the Regent of Lindblum, Cid Fabul the other was a 
very different looking Eiko Carol. Garnet laughed inwardly at the 
changes in the summoner girl. Her somewhat bratty image was now 
shrouded by a vale of silk. She wore a beautiful light pink dress.

Her immaturity seemed like it had vanished. Until....

&#39;Daaagger!!&#39; The little girl ran across the room and hugged Garnet 
being as small as she was she stood hugging her legs.

&#39;Hi Eiko, I haven&#39;t seen you in months&#39;

&#39;Yeah, It&#39;s been a long time&#39;

&#39;It has&#39;

&#39;You wanna go on another adventure? Royal life is too boring.&#39;

Garnet chuckled.

&#39;Life is an awfully big adventure.&#39;

&#39;I thought you&#39;d say something like that. He He&#39;

&#39;Garnet&#39; The Regent spoke. &#39;I&#39;m sorry to interrupt but we have to talk&#39;

&#39;Of course&#39;

&#39;Beatrix would you take care of Eiko?&#39;

&#39;Of course&#39;

&#39;Eiko would you go with Beatrix?&#39;

&#39;Yeah okay&#39;

&#39;I&#39;ll return at one. When the bells chime.&#39;

&#39;Alright, Thank you Beatrix

The summoner and the Queen&#39;s Personal Guard left the room.

Garnet and The Regent had began to talk about the festival while 
Beatrix an Eiko went to see  Remmus Toh the resident scientist. He 
agreed to look at the arrow. They wandered around the castle talking 
about the adventure for hours.

They then found themselves in a room near the Queen&#39;s to look at the 
scenery of the Kingdom.

&#39;Beatrix, I&#39;m sorry&#39;

&#39;What for?&#39;

&#39;Being a burden, You are an Alexandrian General not a baby sitter&#39;

&#39;It&#39;s alright, I like to take care of younger people. I used to take 
care of Dagger when she was little until the King died.&#39;

&#39;I was being trained to become a palace guard when I was seventeen. I 
met and played with the Queen. We used to have so much fun and I loved 
being with her but as I grew my duties called for me to be further away 
from her. Until one day I was promoted to General and rarely had a 
chance to speak with her&#39;

&#39;Did you miss her?&#39;

&#39;Yes&#39;

&#39;Did you love her?&#39;

&#39;Like a best friend&#39;

There was a short pause.

&#39;Do you love her?&#39;

&#39;Of course&#39;

&#39;No I mean do you love her?&#39;

&#39;I said I do&#39;

&#39;I don&#39;t mean friendship love, I mean romance love&#39;

Beatrix stood stunned. How could this little girl who hadn&#39;t seen her 
in months know how she felt.

&#39;If you do, tell her. I know that&#39;s the best thing to do. I know two 
female mogs who loved each other. Amber and Lize. They both told me 
they liked each other. It took  a while but when Amber told Lize, Lize 
was happy.&#39; Eiko laughed. &#39;I&#39;ve never heard so many kupos in one day&#39;

&#39;How...how did you know how I felt?&#39;

&#39;When you entered the dining room. I could see that you kept looking at 
her the same way Amber looked at Lize. I noticed the way Dagger was 
looking at you too. I think she likes you too.&quot;

&#39;Really?&#39;

&#39;Very much so&#39;

&#39;I&#39;ve felt like this for some time and haven&#39;t had anyone to speak to. 
Then you come along and make everything alright.  I love you Eiko&#39;

&#39;I thought you loved Dagger&#39;

Beatrix laughed.

&#39;Oh I do with all my heart, for you i mean love as in liking you&#39; 

Beatrix was suprised that a six-year-old girl had such wisdom. This was 
one amazing girl. Not many six year olds can say they have knowledge 
beyond their years and saved a planet. She was extraordinary.

&#39;Okay&#39; Eiko said cheerily.

&#39;Please, don&#39;t tell her.&#39;

&#39;I won&#39;t, I promise.&#39;

The Bells in the church rang out. It was time to return to the Queen.

She returned to the Queen and they escorted. The Regent and his adopted 
daughter to the the newly built airship docking bay. Before they 
departed Beatrix made a point of saying &#39;Thank you&#39; to Eiko. This child 
had more worldly knowledge than she could ever hope to attain.

Eiko didn&#39;t say &#39;You&#39;re welcome&#39; Or even &#39;Goodbye&#39; She only said. &#39;Tell 
her&#39;

They left Alexandria and returned home.

Later that day Beatrix collected the information on the arrow. She was 
told that the arrow had now been made from any wood seen on their 
continent.

She forwarded the information to Dagger.

&#39;Beatrix, The Regent and I have set a trap for my attacker.&#39;

&#39;Really?&#39;

&#39;Yes, we have decided to hold the Festival of the Hunt here in 
Alexandria it is scheduled for three weeks from today. To give my 
asailant&#39;s wound time to heal. If we find a participant that has a bow 
and arrow we find the attacker.&#39;

&#39;That&#39;s a great idea!&#39;

&#39;Thank you&#39;

&#39;Oh, It was your idea? It&#39;s even greater then&#39;

&#39;Thank you&#39; The Queen replied obviously self satisfied.

The day passed as usual there was security in the knowledge that the 
assailant was out of action. Beatrix was pleasantly suprised to find 
the Queen still wanted her company in bed. 

They lived life as usual for two weeks and six days. They both went to 
bed as usual. Beatrix still was adamant to wear a bra and Garnet still 
wore her elegant night gowns.

Everything was normal, to be more exact it was this strange new type of 
normal that had evolved between them over the past few weeks.

The night before the festival they went to bed as usual; with one 
exception.

The crickets, the flowing river, these were the only two things making 
noise in the dark of the night. Every one in the Kingdom was a sleep 
with the exception of the palace guards. And now Beatrix.

Beatrix awoke when the howl of a wild animal sounded in the distance.

When she woke the first thing she noticed was that she was facing the 
Queen and that the Queen had her arms around her not only this but 
their lips were touching.

Beatrix lay in the silence, in the darkness, with her lips still 
attached to Garnet&#39;s.

She closed her eyes.

She lay in comfort feeling the sensation of their lips touching.

A few seconds later she opened her eye.

She now saw that the Queen was also awake.

In shock she panicked and quickly moved her head away from the Queen&#39;s.

To her suprise and delight Garnet pulled her head back toward&#39;s her 
own.

Garnet&#39;s lips started to move as Beatrix began to move her own they 
kissed for an eternity.

Until Garnet broke off the kiss and simply smiled at her.

Garnet pulled herself close to Beatrix and fell asleep once more in 
Beatrix&#39;s arms.

While Beatrix lay awake trying to figure out what on Gaia just 
happened.
