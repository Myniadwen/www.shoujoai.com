<h1>Save the Queen (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff9/index.html">Final Fantasy  9</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/gliph.html">Gliph Tsy</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was a bright sunny day in the beautiful Kingdom of Alexandria. It 
had been six months since the &#145;Lifa Tree Incident.&#39; Queen Garnet who 
was known affectionately by her friends as Dagger was out inspecting 
the city in its new rebuilt state. Alexandria was a peaceful Kingdom. 
Everyone loved the Queen, men because she was beautiful, women because 
she was an asset to the Kingdom. It was safe to say she was loved by 
everyone; well almost everyone.

&#39;Queen Garnet, I suggest we hurry up and return to the castle&#39;

&#39;Oh Beatrix, You worry to much, it&#146;s a beautiful day and I wish to 
spend at least another hour in town&#39;

&#39;As you wish&#39;

Beatrix, who was acting as bodyguard to Queen Garnet had a feeling 
something bad was going to happen.

------------------------------------------------------------

The Queen aproached a townsperson and began to converse with him.

Beatrix&#39;s senses were on full alert. Her eyes dared not blink whilst 
her ears were picking up any small noises in the vicinity. Suddenly 
Beatrix heard a ripping noise, like something slicing through the air.  
Without a thought she dived towards Garnet grabbing he and falling to 
the floor. An arrow had just closely missed them and was now embedded 
in the wall of a nearby house.

Beatrix ordered her knights to take Garnet indoors as she gave chase.

Beatrix charged through Alexandria searching fo, some one. She didn&#39;t 
exactly know who she was chasing after or where they had went but they 
had almost hurt the Queen, which did constitute as treason. She 
continued running until she got to the centre of town, as expected the 
centre was busy. If the assassin had run through here they would&#39;ve 
been impossible to track. Beatrix felt terrible, she had failed at her 
duties as Garnet&#39;s bodyguard.

Beatrix left for the castle to get a Choco Car to escort Garnet home. 
She returned a short while later in the carriage. She exited and went 
into the house that Garnet had been led to.

&#39;Your highness.&#39;

&#39;Yes Beatrix?&#39;

&#39;We must get you home for some one is out to harm you&#39;

&#39;I understand.&#39;

Garnet was lead out of the house surrounded by knights, and escorted 
into the Choco Car by Beatrix. The carriage began its journey.

&#39;Beatrix?&#39;

&#39;Yes, your Highness?&#39;

&#39;I just wanted to say thank you. Garnet moved closer to Beatrix and put 
her arms around her waist. Beatrix became increasingly nervous.

She looked at the beautiful Queen of Alexandria.

Garnet&#39;s head, moved closer to Beatrix. 

&#39;Y...Your Highness?&#39;

&#39;Yes?&#39; Garnet asked as she put her head on Beatrix&#39;s shoulder.

Beatrix calmed.

&#39;I live my life to serve you&#39; 

They carriage traveled through town and arrived at the castle. 

&#39;This way, Your Highness&#39;

As they entered the castle they were ready to go their own ways.

&#39;Beatrix!&#39; Garnet called.

&#39;Yes?&#39;

&#39;Could you come to my room at eight o&#39;clock? I have something i wish to 
discuss with you&#39;

&#39;As you wish&#39;

They parted.

------------------------------------------------------------

Beatrix sat in her quarters with many thoughts running through her 
mind. She and Garnet had grown close in the short time that they spent 
together after the &#39;Lifa Tree Incident&#39;. &#39;Why does she wish to see 
me?&#39; She asked herself. &#39;I wonder if she noticed the way I have been 
looking at her, i cant help it&#39;

Beatrix sat alone with her thoughts after much thinking about what 
Garnet called her for. She began to think about the assassination 
attempt. Who in the Kingdom of Alexandria would wish to harm her? She 
made sure that none of the Kingdom&#39;s inhabitants were poor and that 
everyone had equal living standards. Why would anyone hate such a great 
ruler?

The thoughts traveled through Beatrix&#39;s head until eight o&#39;clock. Now 
it was time to meet with Garnet. Beatrix traversed through the palace 
growing increasingly nervous. The more halls she traveled through the 
more intense the feeling became. She stopped outside the first door the 
Queen&#39;s living quarters as the Guards opened the door.She heard the 
Queens beautiful singing voice which came from the bedroom. As she 
stood outside the door to Garnet&#39;s bedroom she felt that she would 
collapse. Beatrix paused, she couldn&#39;t go in to see the Queen as a 
nervous wreck. She chanted a mantra inside her head &#39;You can&#146;t control 
the outcome, if you can&#146;t control yourself&#39; She began to calm. 

She braced herself. 

She entered.

&#39;Your Highness?&#39;

&#39;Hello Beatrix&#39;

&#39;You wished to see me?&#39;

&#39;Yes, I have to speak with you&#39;

&#39;Is it about today&#39;s Incident?&#39;

&#39;Not exactly, it&#39;s about you&#39;

&#39;I?&#39;

&#39;I have noticed you seem to be acting strangely around me..........&#39;

Beatrix looked to her eyes.

&#39;Is it because of what happened, with my mother and us?&#39; Garnet 
continued. 

Beatrix knew this wasn&#39;t the problem but she couldn&#39;t say &#39;I admire 
you&#39; So she used the Queens words to continue the conversation.

&#39;Yes, I am ashamed of my actions&#39;

&#39;Beatrix, I have forgiven you, you shouldn&#39;t concern yourself any 
longer&#39;

&#39;Yes, Your Majesty&#39;

&#39;And please, stop calling me &#39;Your Highness&#39; or &#39;Your Majesty&#39; you know 
me enough to call me Garnet or even Dagger&#39;

&#39;Yes your....Dagger&#39;

&#39;Thats much better&#39; Garnet smiled &#39;Now there is one matter we have to 
discuss&#39;

&#39;Yes?&#39;

&#39;You seem to be nervous around me. I would like to remedy that&#39;

Beatrix became worried. The only reason she had became nervous was 
because she was harbouring feelings toward the queen which she could 
never mention to anyone.

&#39;I am sorry&#39;

&#39;It&#39;s alright, to stop the nervousness I want you to be more than my 
Bodyguard.................&#39;

Was this what Beatrix had longed for? A chance to be the one to make 
Garnet smile, to hold her, to tell her everything was alright.

&#39;I wish for you to be my Personal Guard. Which means you would be my 
aid, my confidant and would be near me more than anyone else&#39;

Beatrix thought this was too good to be true. She had recently admitted 
her feelings to herself and now to be closer to the Angelic Alexandrian 
than anyone else. It was like all her birthdays had come a once.

&#39;As you wish&#39;

&#39;Would you please wait while I have a bath? I am still weary of attack&#39;

&#39;I shall&#39;

Beatrix sat on Garnet&#39;s bed awaiting her return. And feeling pleased 
about her new position. After fifteen minutes in waiting the Queen 
returned.

Garnet re-entered the room wearing a pink, white laced gown. The gown 
had only one strap on the left shoulder which was held on by a corsage. 
The other shoulder was naked. 

&#39;Beatrix, I know it has been an exhausting day&#39; Garnet picked up a 
brush and started to sweep through the locks of her hair. &#39;But would 
you mind&#39; Garnet banked her head to the right.

Another rip was heard in the hair. The arrow sliced through the corsage 
making the gown fall to the ground. Beatrix had no time to admire the 
sight. She gave chase. As she ran to the balcony she noticed a shadowed 
figure slide down a rope. Assessing the situation Beatrix decided on 
the best course of action. She threw Save The Queen down toward the 
assailant. As it fell through the air it sliced against the attacker&#39;s 
arm, which would obviously leave a large scar. The figured scurried 
away into the darkness. Beatrix slid down the rope as she got to the 
bottom she could not see the assassin any longer. All that was in view 
was Save The Queen embedded in the grass and a streak of blood running 
down the sword. All she could do was wait until a report from the 
hospital came to track down the attacker, after all there can&#39;t be that 
many Alexandrians with gaping wounds in their arms.

Beatrix climbed up the rope with Save The Queen in her left hand and 
struggled up with her right.

Re-entering the room Beatrix noticed Garnet. Garnet was still naked all 
she had done was fall onto the bed and began to cry. She couldn&#146;t 
believe that some on in her Kingdom would want to kill her.

Beatrix walked over to Garnet, sat down beside her and gave her a hug. 
Although Garnet&#39;s breasts were on show this was a purely non-sexual 
action. She held Garnet and began to stroke her still wet hair.

&#39;Beatrix?&#39;

&#39;It&#39;s going to be alright, we&#39;ll find them soon&#39;

&#39;Why?&#39; Garnet sobbed. &#39;Why would anyone wish me dead?&#39;

&#39;I wish I knew but I assure you they won&#39;t get away with it&#39;

&#39;You promise?&#39;

&#39;I swear on my life&#39;

Garnet began to calm a little.

Beatrix broke the hug and went into a nearby chest drawer. She removed 
a gown similar to that of what Garnet was wearing. She helped the still 
shaking Queen into the gown and put her into bed.

&#39;Your highness, I will guard you tonight. So I think you should try and 
rest&#39;

&#39;Thank you Beatrix&#39;

After an hour of attempting to fall asleep Garnet managed it.

Beatrix stood near the window.  There was a streak of moonlight cast 
through the window which shone like a heavenly light on the sleeping 
beauty. Beatrix just stood and admired the beauty of the Queen. She 
admired her clear skinned, perfect, almond shaped face.  Her hazel eyes 
which were now hidden under her gentle eyelids. Her radiant smile which 
could light even the darkest night. Her small but proud body. The Queen 
was indeed an Angelic presence.

Beatrix became startled as she heard a scream. Garnet had awoken and 
began to cry. Beatrix rushed to her and held her once more.

&#39;Why? Why would anyone want to kill me?&#39; She said between tears.

&#39;I wish I knew dear&#39; Beatrix said calmingly.

&#39;Beatrix, could you please hold me?&#39; 

&#39;Yes, Dagger&#39;

Garnet smile whilst sobbing.

The two held each other while Garnet described her nightmare and her 
feelings. Until Beatrix said.

&#39;I think you should try and rest once more&#39;

&#39;But what if I have another nightmare? Please don&#146;t leave me alone&#39;

&#39;Would you like me to sleep beside you?&#39;

Beatrix mentally slapped herself. She had just asked if she could share 
a bed with the queen. If this infuriated Garnet she could lose her 
newly acquired position. She waited for a response while fear took over 
her mind.     

To her shock and surprise the Queen agreed. Beatrix broke off the hug, 
climbed off the bed and began to undress.

Garnet watched in awe as Beatrix removed her clothing, exposing her 
skin slowly. She almost teasingly undid the buckles across her shirt. 
She began to slowly let the shoulder straps slide down her arms.  The 
shirt fell to the ground exposing Beatrix&#39;s perfect breasts. Beatrix 
shook her head letting her beautiful silky hair bounce. Turning away 
from the Queen she then removed her trousers exposing her underwear 
which gave a perfect view of her pert bottom.

She located a clothes rack and hung her clothing on it.

The Queen smiled at her nervously.

Beatrix smiled back and began to crawl into the bed. The Queen turned 
in the oposite direction as Beatrix came in behind her. Beatrix curled 
close to Garnet and put her arms around her. She was so close that 
Garnet could feel her Personal Guard&#39;s breasts pressing against her 
back. In this situation Garnet should have felt awkward but she felt 
quite the opposite. She felt comfortable, the warmth and feeling of 
another being was exactly what she needed at this time.

&#39;Goodnight Beatrix&#39; she said.

&#39;Goodnight Dagger&#39; Beatrix replied.

She smiled as if she had been given the greatest gift. In fact Beatrix 
believed that she had. She fell asleep with her arms around the Queen.
