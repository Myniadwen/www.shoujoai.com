<h1>Love Angels (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../weddingpeach/index.html">Wedding Peach</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kanna.html">Kanna-Ophelia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../weddingpeach/loveangels-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;I always knew Hinagiku like-likes Takorou!&quot; Momoko chattered happily,
as the girls climbed the stairs together. She seemed, Scarlet thought
with growing irritation, ludicrously triumphant over it. Momoko had
already spent half the night analysing every word or look that had
passed between the childhood friends, and Scarlet wasn&#39;t sure how much
more of her adolescent gushings she could take. Especially when every
word cut through her like a knife. &quot;She absolutely hated that
demon-girl hitting on him, Scarlet, I wish you&#39;d seen!&quot;

Scarlet tossed back her red hair and snapped, &quot;Maybe she was just sick
of being the odd one out. That&#39;s usually my job, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Momoko paused with her hand on the door to her bedroom, shocked out of
her train of thought for once in her chatterbox life. &quot;Oh, Scarlet,
I&#39;m so sorry. I didn&#39;t think you cared, I mean, you could have any boy
you like, you know that, and you never bring a date...&quot; Rosy lips
trembled penitently, and Scarlet was afraid Momoko was going to hug
her. And she couldn&#39;t bear the other girl&#39;s arms around her, not right
now... Not now she was suddenly unable to trust herself around any of
her friends and, most particularly, this one.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she sighed, warding Momoko&#39;s embrace off. &quot;I don&#39;t know
what&#39;s come over me...&quot;

//No idea at all,// she echoed bitterly in the privacy of her own mind
//I don&#39;t even recall dreaming of you every night, or being able to
get the image of Yuri and Hinagiku together out of my mind. I
certainly don&#39;t care at all that I kissed you under the mistletoe
tonight and it meant, nothing, nothing at all. Because it&#39;s all a
game, and I am your friend, and you&#39;re involved in the Romeo and
Juliet romance of the century. And just to rub it in, you&#39;ve spent the
last ten minutes relentlessly heterosexualising the only fucking
lesbian you know. Damnit, I really did drink too much champagne
tonight...//

Scarlet was half-blinded by futile, girlish, half-drunk tears as she
followed Momoko into her room. She felt sick to her stomach, and
wanted nothing more than to curl up on her stretcher bed, close her
eyes, block out her thoughts - and shut Momoko&#39;s bloody chatter off
for a moment, she realised, as the younger girl, reassured, started
off again on her Hinagiku-Takorou fantasies again, sharing them with
Jamapi this time.

She managed to block out the words as she sat on the bed, but that
didn&#39;t help, because now she was watching Momoko&#39;s lips move, and
remembering how silken they had felt against hers.

The rest of the evening with her friend&#39;s family had been both more
difficult and easier to endure than Scarlet had feared. It was
entrancingly effortless, after all, to watch Momoko, her vivid face
lit up with pleasure at Christmas and her family, to try to analyse
her appeal. It was more than just beauty. All angels were flawless, by
definition. And it was more than just charm of expression. Yuri&#39;s
manner was enough to cause serious tooth decay, after all, and despite
that brief moment of weakness on the road earlier that day, Scarlet
never dreamed of Yuri. There was strength and animation in Momoko&#39;s
face, tempering both the perfect features and the gentle face, somehow
escaping both cold purity and insipidity. Scarlet had stared at
firelight reflected in clear blue eyes, and tried to find the word.

Pretty. Momoko was pretty. Such an incongruously human word for the
legendary Angel Wedding Peach. But then, Momoko was so incongruously
human. And &#39;pretty&#39; suited her, somehow evoked exactly the sweet ache
her face caused in Scarlet&#39;s... She bit the thought off. //Watch
yourself, Salvia. Love may be angelic, but romance and passion are
human inventions. For weak humans. Not Fighter Angels//

Of course there was Sakura, wrapped around and in her human husband.

No, the difficulty did not lie in Momoko&#39;s presence or her laughter,
which was becoming more addictive and necessary by the moment. It lay
in trying to control her own reactions. Especially when her innocent &#150;
and heterosexual, Scarlet, try to remember that - friend took her hand
and pulled her, giggling, under the mistletoe. At least, Momoko was
giggling. Scarlet was trying very hard not to run away.

She could feel burning blood flood her cheeks, creep down to spread
hot blood across her breasts. Momoko&#39;s parents were watching her,
smiling indulgently. And it wasn&#39;t as if Scarlet didn&#39;t know the human
script off by heart. A teasing smile, a gentle peck on the lips...
Yousuke could do it. Yousuke would make some joke about ugly girls
needing to use mistletoe, and kiss her, not too much, not too little,
just a casual, fond kiss. Yousuke was Momoko&#39;s boyfriend, her true
love...

Yousuke was the devil Viento, and had absolutely no right to kiss an
angel. Scarlet, as Salvia, was Peach&#39;s equal &#150; her better &#150; and had
every right in the world. And she could no more call Peach &#39;Momopi&#39;
and tease and kiss her than she could fly. Perhaps not such a
wonderful thing, being a Love Angel, after all. Maybe that was what
Hinagiku felt when she looked at Yuri...

Momoko was twinkling at her, no angelic detachment in her at all. &quot;Am
I so very dreadful you can&#39;t bear to touch me, Scarlet? One kiss!&quot; And
her father had shouted approval, and Scarlet had looked at her closest
friend&#39;s smile and realised, quite simply, that the confusion of the
last few days had all been a matter of recognising that she was in
love. Madly, passionately, agonisingly in love. And now she was going
to have a chance to kiss her beloved. Lucky, lucky girl...

She had bent her head, and left a soft, chaste kiss on Momoko&#39;s
waiting mouth, and lifted her head to see, through burning eyes,
Momoko still merry-eyed, and her parents beaming laughing approval on
the. So cute and innocent, two little girls kissing under the
mistletoe. Good for a laugh and a misty eye or two.

Scarlet had done exactly what was expected, and done it beautifully,
as always. Nothing to reproach herself with. She hadn&#39;t, for example,
devoured Momoko&#39;s sweet lips, plied them with adoring kisses, pulled
her close enough to feel the soft warmth of her breasts against her
own, parted Momoko&#39;s mouth with her tongue and taken the warm depths,
kissed her breathless and made love to her on the lounge room floor...
Merely pressed their mouths briefly together, smiled unconcernedly,
and stepped away. Ice princess demeanor intact.

If Scarlet&#39;s lips burned and ached now, it surely wasn&#39;t her fault.
She had done the right thing. As always.

/ ** / ** / ** / ** /

She dropped her head on the pillows so that she would not have to
watch Momoko, still rattling on, unconcernedly strip in front of her.
Or, come to that, she feared being too obviously not looking. After
all, girls often undressed in front of each other. It was perfectly
acceptable, because everyone knew girls could have no sexual interest
in each other whatsoever. Anyway, the Angels all saw each other naked
during the transformations.

Well, not even Momoko usually changed her clothes in front of
Hinagiku. But that was a little different.

//Face it, Scarlet, you&#39;re different too. A lesbian angel in human
form in love with a heterosexual bimbo half-angel. Different is hardly
the word...///

Scarlet rolled over and heaved a sigh.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Momoko, mercifully still with her virginal cotton bra
and panties intact, sat beside her. Oh, goddess, she was stroking the
hair back from Scarlet&#39;s forehead... Her hand was as soft as Scarlet had
imagined, with tiny roughnesses on the pads of her fingertips from all
the hours spent typing for her school newspaper. The older girl felt
hot blood rise in her face.

&quot;Lady Salvia is tired, pii?&quot; Jamapi half-suggested half-asked in its
piping voice, bobbing around the ceiling like an obese cupid.

Momoko&#39;s eyes were filling with sentimental tears of her own. Scarlet
realised she wasn&#39;t the only one in the room slightly drunk.

&quot;Of course she&#39;s worn out!&quot; the pink-haired girl cried repentantly.
&quot;No wonder, after today. I&#39;m such an inconsiderate bitch... I never
thanked you properly for saving us all today... You really pulled our
arses out of the fire, Angel Salvia. As usual. I don&#39;t know what we
did before we found you.&quot; She stooped and kissed Scarlet&#39;s
blush-heated forehead.

Scarlet closed her eyes against the almost overwhelming desire to
reach up, grab her friend and pull her down against her to be kissed
properly. Holy Aphrodite, why did Momoko have to be so sweet at such
bad moments?

She sought for something to say, anything but the &quot;I love you&quot; which
was rising to her lips without her accord. 

&quot;Momoko, why do you want so much for Hinagiku to fall in love with
Takourou? Can&#39;t you tell she likes Yuri?&quot; 

There was a silence, then a worried, &quot;What&#39;s wrong, Lady Peach pii?&quot;

Scarlet opened her eyes to see Momoko blushing as furiously as she
was. There was palpable distress in those huge eyes. The older girl
sat up in concern.

&quot;Momoko, what&#39;s wrong, dear?&quot; The endearment slipped out without her
knowledge. She just wanted so desperately to cancel out that pain... But
there was a sudden paranoid fear in her heart, too. Momoko wasn&#39;t in
love with Yuri herself, surely not...

&quot;Nothing&#39;s wrong.&quot; She tossed her head, and candy-coloured locks
floated into the air before settling again, feather-light, on bare
shoulders. Scarlet spared some of her attention to melt. &quot;I&#39;m a Love
Angel, isn&#39;t it natural to want my friends to find love?&quot; She wouldn&#39;t
meet Scarlet&#39;s gaze.
