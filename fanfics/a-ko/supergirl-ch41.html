Karsta Wor-Ul soared through space in her simple black
bodysuit, the older woman&#39;s white hair flowing with
her movements in the void. She reached the asteroid as
planned and braced herself, choosing the most stable
spot, then began to push as planned. Her muscles ached
and pain flared behind her eyes, but she persevered
until she heard a signal in the simple ear peace she
wore.

&quot;Thank you, Karsta,&quot; the voice said to her in their
alien speech, &quot;you have deflected the path of the
asteroid and saved our world.&quot;

&#39;What a strange species,&#39; Karsta found herself
thinking wryly as she soared back to her temporary
home base, high above the surface of the world.

Centuries ago Karsta, along with a group of other
Kryptonian army deserters, had committed crimes
against a number of alien species. She had ended up on
Earth living as Kristen Wells when her past finally
caught up with her, and she and Superman had defeated
the hunters chasing her. Deciding to finally face her
past Karsta willingly surrendered to the authorities,
only to find a most unusual judge. The species
involved believed in redemption and compensation,
leading him to order Karsta to use her Kryptonian
abilities to try and balance the scales for the crimes
she had committed.

Karsta dropped through the atmosphere to the
combination prison and residence that she lived in, a
floating complex apart from the major cities of
Tau-Lentra, and landed gracefully, walking through the
archway into her home. &quot;Computer,&quot; she asked in
Interlac, &quot;any new problems I need to be aware of?&quot;

&quot;Reports are trickling in of a new Warworld,&quot; the
computer reported to her emotionlessly, &quot;destination
and power level unknown.&quot;

&quot;Warworld?!&quot; Karsta stiffened in surprise.

Warworld was a threat that even Karsta had heard of
while traveling in space, a massive construct that was
packed to the top with weapons and alien warriors
itching to do battle. Ruled over by the powerful
warlord Mongul it had cut a swath across space until
Superman and his allies had succeeded in defeating
them.

&quot;Contact the Green Lantern of our sector 2813,&quot; Karsta
ordered briskly as she pulled out her battle gear,
&quot;see if you can get conformation.&quot;

&quot;Sending subspace message now,&quot; the computer paused a
moment, &quot;I am unable to detect presence of ring or
Green Lantern.&quot;

&quot;Rao...&quot; Karsta cursed softly, her grim thoughts
racing. &quot;Contact the planetary council for me,&quot; she
ordered the computer as she pulled on the blue
bodysuit, secured her weapons belt then shrugged on a
red vest, &quot;I think I&#39;m going to have to see them.&quot;

Not long after that Karsta found herself before the
planetary council of the trading hub she protected,
summarizing the potential threat and outlining
possible responses. &quot;We can try to hide,&quot; she said, &quot;I
can go investigate or we can mobilize every ship we
can and try to stop it.&quot;

Alyx of Rann frowned, the brown haired young woman
studying her intently before she asked, &quot;And which
would you suggest?&quot;

&quot;Option two or three,&quot; Karsta said coolly, &quot;hiding
won&#39;t work, especially if this thing is taking out
Green Lanterns.&quot;

S&#39;one of Dryad tilted his rock like head to the side
as he pointed out, &quot;Our ships are not military craft,
we would be of little use in battle.&quot;

Karsta shrugged slightly, &quot;Any help would be
appreciated.&quot;

The cloaked Durlan shook his head, &quot;Wee can&#39;t strip
our defenses!&quot;

&quot;What defenses?&quot; the Colulan named Van Dex said to
them all dryly, &quot;We barely have anything in place to
protect the planet.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Alyx met her eyes with real regret, &quot;we
cannot release ships to help stop Warworld.&quot; She
paused, &quot;Are you certain you need to...?&quot;

&quot;Warworld is a threat to this world too,&quot; Karsta said
to them seriously, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be keeping up my vow to
protect this planet if I didn&#39;t try to stop it.&quot;

&quot;Then we&#39;ll vote on releasing you from planetary
defense,&quot; S&#39;one said gravely. The vote was quickly
taken and by a margin of seven votes to three Karsta
was given permission to leave their world.

&quot;Good luck,&quot; the Durlan said quietly as Karsta left.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Karsta replied, &quot;I&#39;ll need it.&quot;

With that Karsta soared away, barely pausing to take
in the world she had guarded for so long. Blue-green
seas shimmered in the sunlight as she raced through
blue skies, the mountains nearby her home looking wild
and untamed.

Karsta noted with some satisfaction that the AI of her
home had already prepped her Kryptonian shuttle for
launch, the crystal craft pointed skyward. Flying
through the gateway into her home she called, &quot;Do you
have a path or destination for Warworld?&quot;

&quot;The energy wake have been back tracked,&quot; the computer
responded primly, &quot;and a course has been extrapolated
from the data.&quot;

&quot;Where to?&quot; Karsta asked seriously.

&quot;Sol-3,&quot; the computer replied, &quot;the planet Terrans
call Earth.&quot;

Krysta stiffened, then nodded slightly. &quot;I was almost
expecting that,&quot; she admitted grimly. She looked
thoughtful, &quot;Load the anti-Daxamite guns on my
shuttle, just in case.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; the computer replied.

Packing some extra clothes away in her satchel Karsta
slung it up over her shoulder, then looked around her
small rooms. Satisfied she had what she needed she
headed to the door, &quot;Shut the place down for awhile, I
don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be back.&quot;

&quot;Acknowledged,&quot; the computer answered, &quot;good luck,
Karsta Wor-Ul.&quot;

Within moments Karsta was off, the silvery crystal
ship carrying her out of the atmosphere and into space
far faster than she could have flown. From the edge of
the planet&#39;s gravity they raced through the debris
belt and out into the region beyond the major
gravitational pull of any nearby olanets, after which
she activated the first space jump. From one system to
another she jumped, retracing her steps until Karsta
reached the edge of the inner Solar System.

Donning a small breather device Karsta popped up the
top of her shuttle, eagerly standing in the pure light
of Earth&#39;s yellow sun. Already she could feel it
charging her body, filling her up with a strength far
greater than the power she gained from the weaker
light of the orange sun she had last charged up under.

Karsta&#39;s ships sensors showed Warworld moving slowly
through the Solar System, giving her several options.
She could risk a small warp jump ahead of them, try to
slip around or finally just try to barge straight
through them. While a frontal attack was tempting,
caution might serve her best...

A flare of light was the only warning she got as twin
figures soared in, nearly raming her ship as they
fired off twin bolts of heat vision. Racing away from
her craft Karsta floated in the void, eyes narrowed as
the girls swept in again

&quot;Old crone,&quot; a green haired and buxom woman frowned as
she demanded over the radio implanted in Karsta&#39;s
breathing unit, &quot;what are you doing in this solar
system?&quot;

&quot;That depends,&quot; Karsta answered coolly, &quot;are you two
from Warworld?&quot;

The brown haired girl sniffed, unaware the noise
didn&#39;t carry in space as she said disdainfully, &quot;We
are the warrior elite of Warworld, surrender or be
destroyed.&quot;

&quot;Well, elite,&quot; Karsta replied, &quot;I&#39;m...&quot; she hesitated
then used her Earth name, &quot;Kirsten Wells, and I&#39;m the
last surviving soldier of the Kryptonian Empire.&quot;

&quot;Wha...&quot; the green haired girl looked startled.

Whipping around her gun far faster than the girls had
moved Karsta added as she fired, &quot;And I&#39;ve taken on
tougher things than you before breakfast.&quot;

The energy bolts from the anti-daxamite weapon cut
through the energy fields that generated the girls
invulnerability, stunning them as Karsta moved in.
With lethal efficiency she broke one&#39;s neck, gunning
the other girl down as she tried to flee.

Slinging her gun back Karsta searched the bodies then
slung them out and away from the Sun, depriving them
of any possible healing from the power of the Sun. &#39;I
doubt Kal-El would approve,&#39; she mused as she
collected her spare weapons and donned them, &#39;but I&#39;m
not a hero, I&#39;m a warrior.&#39;

With a flick of a few switches Karsta sent her ship
off on a stable orbit, one she could track via a
certain broadcast frequency. With a bit of regret she
left her ship behind and soared off, following the
trail of destruction. Parts of the surface of Mars had
been bodily torn up for fuel, and there were wide gaps
in Saturn&#39;s rings as well as in the asteroid belt.

&#39;They must have expended incredible amounts of fuel to
get here,&#39; Karsta thought, &#39;their reactors must be
starving,&#39;

As Karsta flew Warworld grew larger and larger,
filling the view in front of her as she caught up to
the massive ship. Dodging and weaving through
defensive fire she rammed down into the surface,
bouncing up as she hit the armored skin.

&quot;Well, time to crack a egg,&quot; Karsta muttered as she
pulled out a Neutron grenade and activated it, tossing
it seconds before it detonated blasting a massive hole
in the armor.

Women rushed to fill the gap, weapons ready as they
saw the old women casually drop into the outer section
of armor and open fire with her unusual guns.
&quot;Surrender, woman,&quot; a bulky, orange haired woman
demanded.

&quot;Never,&quot; Karsta blasted away, felling the women left
and right as she added, &quot;come, and see how a
kryptonian wages war!&quot;

To be continued...

Notes: Karsta Wor-Ul aka Kristen Wells was introduced
in the storyline &quot;The Third Kryptonian&quot; in the issues
leading up to 669.
