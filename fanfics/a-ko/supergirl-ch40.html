<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 40 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../a-ko/index.html">Project A-ko</a>

<a href="../a-ko/supergirl-ch39.html">Back to Part 39</a><pre>Green light flared from the planet Oa as the soldiers
of the Guardians, the Green Lanterns, were marshaled
for battle. On the grounds before the great Central
Battery they gathered, dozens swelling to hundreds as
all available members answered the call to arms.

There was a murmur of surprise as blue light flashed,
then a delegation of Blue Lanterns descended, lead by
the female Guardian called Sayd. &quot;We&#39;re here to help,&quot;
the white haired humanoid said, looking up to meet the
eyes of the Guardian Ganthlet, the founder and former
leader of the Blues.

Ganthlet nodded from the podium, the little blue
skinned man looking relieved. &quot;It&#39;s good to have you
here,&quot; he admitted, his red robe swirling around him.

&quot;What;&#39;s the situation?&quot; Sayd asked him softly as her
people mingled nervously with the Green Lanterns. The
other colored rings had fought the Corps in the
conflict some called Darkest Night, and a lingering
sense of distrust remained even years later.

Ganthlet led her into the Guardian&#39;s citadel on Oa as
he said, &quot;A reconstructed Warworld has cut a swath
across the galaxy, heading towards Earth.&quot;

&quot;The primary world,&quot; Sayd&#39;s eyes widened in alarm.

While Oa was the center of the Universe, Earth heald a
unique place in cosmology. When the universe was split
into a multiverse Earth became the keystone of the new
realities, and it&#39;s destruction could end all the
universes, not just this one. That was why the
Guardians monitored it constantly, and usually were
ready to intervene there.

Within the council chambers of the Guardians was
another surprise, a Violet Lantern serving the
Zamorans. &quot;I am sorry, Guardians,&quot; the purple clad
woman said coolly, &quot;we have heard your plea, but we
cannot fight beside you.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; the lead Guardian said regretfully. He
looked at her thoughtfully, &quot;Can your Corps at least
try to keep the Red Lanterns from interfering?&quot;

The Violet Lantern sniffed, &quot;We will always be willing
to stop those hate filled fools.&quot; Not waiting for any
further comments she turned, her revealing bodysuit
hugging her form, then blasted off in a blaze of
light.

&quot;The love guided Lanterns are dangerously emotional,&quot;
a Guardian muttered.

&quot;They helped us prevent Darkest Night,&quot; Ganthlet said
dryly, &quot;they&#39;ll do.&quot;

Sayd approached the Guardians as she asked, &quot;Is this
Warworld such a threat?&quot;

&quot;Dozens of Green Lanterns have been killed trying to
slow it down,&quot; a female Guardian took a turn to
explain, &quot;it&#39;s packed with the best fighting forces in
the Galaxy.&quot;

&quot;And then there&#39;s the Sinestro Corps,&quot; Ganthlet added
bleakly.

Founded in the anti-matter universe, the Sinestro
Corps were the opposite numbers to the Green Lanterns,
powered by yellow fear rather than green willpower.
Despite the defeat of their founder, the renegade
Sinestro, the corps did everything they could to hurt
the Green Lanterns and undermine their work.

&quot;What are they...?&quot; Sayd asked, frowning.

The lead Guardian looked grim, &quot;The Sinestro Corps is
mobilizing to support Warworld. If they unite their
forces, Earth may be doomed.&quot;

Ganthlet nodded as he agreed, &quot;Which is why we must
stop the Sinestro Corps before they can do so.&quot;

&quot;And you need our help,&quot; Sayd realized.

Another one of the Guardians started, &quot;WE don&#39;t NEED
your help, but...&quot;

&quot;Hush,&quot; Ganthlet said flatly, the other Guardian
shutting up immediately. &quot;We&#39;ve lost many Green
Lanterns of late, some of which I think relates to
this Warworld situation.&quot; He sighed, &quot;Short of
throwing trainees in, we lack numbers to stop the
Sinestro Corps.&quot;

There was a bit of unrest among the Guardians, but
they soon fell into line. Ganthlet was the eldest of
the current generation of Guardians, as well as a
almost legendary figure who had fought against beings
such as the maddened Hal Jordan and Parallax, and his
very presence carried a immense weight.

As a group the Guardians and Sayd addressed their
troops, then watched as the blue and green forces took
off into the star filled sky. &quot;Do you ever miss what
we shared?&quot; Sayd asked Ganthlet softly, reaching out
to take his hand.

Ganthlet squeezed her fingers gently as he admitted,
&quot;Every day.&quot; He shrugged his shoulders, &quot;But after a
Guardian betrayed them in Blackest Night, someone had
to come back and lead them...&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Meanwhile, on Earth raw panic began to take hold as
the people started to grasp the severity of the coming
threat, and the very real possibility they might all
die. Riots and looking broke out in deserted cities,
the majority of people having fled for the hills.

The Ray flashed golden as he shpped light energy,
forming a barrier as a mob attempted to storm the New
York Museum. Ray smiled, his face half hidden by a
golden helm, &quot;You are not looting the place today.&quot;

&quot;The world&#39;s ending anyway!&quot; one man yelled, &quot;Let us
in!&quot;

&quot;Not if we can help it,&quot; Ray said firmly, silently
vowing to go down fighting if need be.

In Gotham a uneasy calm settled over the city, most
people unwilling to Flee. Much like when the city was
declared a no man&#39;s land the people refused to give
in, hunkering down in their homes armed and ready.

Dryad reformed her body out of vines, the plant woman
taking her place amid the others, waiting for action.
In the night sky was a growing silver star, the
Warworld coming closer and closer to Earth. &quot;Any signs
of attack yet?&quot; she asked quietly, her rose hair
flowing over green skin.

The Knight shifted, his steel face expressionless as
the armored figure growled, &quot;Not yet.&quot; Massive batlike
wings stretched from his back,his gloves taloned and
frightening as hew peered at the street below.

Raven, the masked vigilante and her partner Robin
stood off to one side, a oasis of eerie calm. &quot;I&#39;m
nervous,&quot; Carrie admitted, pushing up the goggles she
wore as a Robin mask.

Raven nodded as Cassandra Cain said, &quot;That&#39;s good.&quot; A
faint smile creased her full face mask, &quot;A little fear
will make you sharper, just as long as you don&#39;t let
it control you.&quot;

&quot;Then I guess I&#39;m really sharp,&quot; Cassie chuckled.

Catwoman slinked over to Dryad as the gray clad woman
smiled wryly, her golden eyes looking amused. &quot;I&#39;m
glad you&#39;re here,&quot; Jane Vale casually pushed back her
hood, shaking out her short blonde hair.

Dryad looked surprised, &quot;What about your secret ID?&quot;

Jane looked faintly amused as she answered, &quot;If we
survive all of this, I&#39;ll worry about my secrets
then.&quot;

&quot;Good point,&quot; Dryad agreed.

Jane sat on the ledge, swinging her feet casually as
she looked yp at Dryad, &quot;Come down here, you
intimidate me.&quot;

&quot;I intimidate you?&quot; Dryad looked amused as she settled
down beside her.

&quot;Very,&quot; Jane admitted, &quot;I think that&#39;s why I get so
smart with you.&quot; She took a deep breath, &quot;I wanted to
apologize, actually.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Dryad looked confused.

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have teased you so much that time in the
park,&quot; Jane confessed.

Dryad sighed softly, &quot;No, you were right. I was hung
up on Kestrel, and until you told me I never saw it.&quot;

Jane put a hand on her arm, &quot;I&#39;m still sorry for being
so harsh.&quot;

Dryad covered it with her own, &quot;It&#39;s all right.&quot;

The Knight turned away, a odd feeling of amusement in
his metallic heart. Across town in his mansion Bruce
Wayne sat back, his VR interface directly connecting
him to the armored Knight. Carefully turning the
microphone aside he murmured, &quot;Well, I wasn&#39;t
expecting that.&quot;

Oracle looked amused as the holographic woman asked,
&quot;Were you not expecting a quiet Gotham or Dryad and
Catwoman?&quot;

&quot;Both!&quot; Bruce chuckled. He became more serious as he
added, &quot;It&#39;s just the calm before the storm, though.
Once Warworld is here, thing&#39;s will get...
interesting.&quot;

&quot;Agreed,&quot; Oracle said seriously. She smiled grimly,
&quot;We&#39;re preparing to launch a space team against
Warworld, with volunteers from several past Leagues.&quot;

&quot;Leader?&quot; Bruce wondered.

&quot;Supergirl,&quot; Oracle answered promptly, &quot;but Captain
Atom will be functioning as her second in command,
along with J&#39;onn.&quot;

&quot;Keep an eye on Atom,&quot; Bruce said after a moment, &quot;I
don&#39;t trust him as much since he became Monarch the
second time.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t trust anyone entirely,&quot; Oracle noted.

&quot;True,&quot; Bruce agreed mildly. He gave her a shrewd
glance, &quot;So, are you and Kyla...?&quot;

&quot;Bruce!&quot; Oracle looked startled.

Bruce actually grinned, &quot;Well, you two have been
dancing around each other for weeks...&quot; he chuckled.
&quot;Besides, a crisis has been known to bring unlikely
couples together,&quot; he added.

&quot;You hacked into the Watchtower again?&quot; Oracle looked
at him suspiciously.

Bruce just winked.
