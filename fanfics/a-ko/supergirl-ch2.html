<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 2 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../a-ko/index.html">Project A-ko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../a-ko/supergirl-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre> The massive limo pulled up to the little house, and the window rolled 
down. B-ko looked out the window at the shell of the house, and muscles 
in her jaw clenched. Over the last few days the house had been stripped 
of almost everything by people looking for souvenirs of where Superman 
and his family had lived.

The driver kept the engine running as B-ko got out of the car and walked 
over to the front of the house. &#39;Where are they?&#39; she found herself 
thinking, then, &#39;Where is she?&#39;

A soft chirp startled B-ko, and she pushed her sleeve up to look at her 
bracelet. She touched a few switches gently, and frowned. A holographic 
view screen was projected, and she studied the readings for a moment. 
&quot;Interesting, very interesting,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Could that be some kind 
of teleportation residue?&quot; she asked herself quietly.

&quot;We&#39;re going home,&quot; B-ko said to the driver smoothly, climbing back into 
the Limo&#39;s back seat even as she began to consider the problem. Less 
than one hour later and she had finished designing the apparatus she 
thought she&#39;d be needing. About two hours later, it was finally built 
and all ready for the smoke test.

&quot;Smoke test?&quot; her robotic maid D-ko asked. One evening B-ko had gotten 
tired of talking to herself while working, so she had built it to talk 
with, and to assist her in her work.

B-ko smiled at the blonde robot dressed in a maid&#39;s costume and holding 
a tray of tools for her. &quot;Smoke test is an old engineering term,&quot; B- ko 
explained to her, &quot;you turn the machine on and see if smoke comes out.&quot;

The robot nodded, visibly filing the information away in her memory. 
&quot;Are you sure this is a good idea?&quot; D-ko asked her. &quot;I mean, you don&#39;t 
even know if A-ko went along willingly or was kidnapped by unknown 
parties.&quot;

B-ko grinned evily. &quot;Come on,&quot; she waved, leading D-ko towards as blank 
wall. She pressed a stone, and the wall slid aside revealing a concealed 
room. &quot;This is what I&#39;m going to wear when I go after her,&quot; B-ko 
gestured to a newly built armor.

The silvery suit looked far more formidable than any of B-ko&#39;s previous 
suits, a form hugging silver sheath. The boots and gloves were still the 
central weapons, but a backpack had been added to the design as well. 
Instead of the flexible clear plastics B-ko had used, a metallic alloy 
covered the majority of the suit.

&quot;Wow,&quot; D-ko said softly.

&quot;It&#39;s at least a full generation beyond anything I&#39;ve built before,&quot; 
B-ko smiled, adding more quietly &quot;I just hope it&#39;s enough.&quot;

They walked back to the main room where the teleporter B-ko had built 
was. B-ko flipped a few switches before declaring, &quot;Power on!&quot;

&quot;No smoke,&quot; D-ko noted with a smile.

B-ko smiled back at her. &quot;Now on to test two,&quot; B-ko smiled. She picked 
up a watermelon she had thought to bring in, and with a marker drew a 
happy face on it. &quot;Good-bye, Mr. Melon,&quot; she said to it cheerfully as 
she sat it on the pad, then hit the activation switch. The watermelon 
disappeared in a burst of light.

&quot;Did it work?&#39; D-ko asked.

B-ko checked her readings, &quot;Transit appears to have been successful.&quot; 
She looked seriously over at D-ko, &quot;Help me with my armor.&quot;

The mesh bodysuit came on first, clinging to B-ko&#39;s body. The central 
body portion attached first, then B-ko slipped the gloves and boots on. 
D- ko lifted the back pack and nestled it on B-ko&#39;s back, then B-ko 
pulled her helmet on. She touched a switch on the inside with the mask 
with her chin, and a charge ran through the different components, 
bonding the entire suit together.

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t you send me through first?&quot; D-ko asked her quietly as they 
readied B-ko for the trip. &quot;I mean, at least that way you&#39;ll know it&#39;s 
safe,&quot; the blonde said.

B-ko looked at her in surprise. &#39;I didn&#39;t program her for that kind of 
concern,&#39; she thought. &#39;Is she evolving beyond what I made her to be?&#39; 
she wondered. Aloud, she answered, &quot;The suit should protect me. It can 
even sustain me for periods of time in space.&quot;

D-ko sighed softly, &quot;All right.&quot; She walked over to stand behind the 
control panel and checked the readings, &quot;Ready to go, here.&quot;

B-ko ran a final check on her armor, then walked over to stand on the 
pad of the teleporter. &quot;Activate,&quot; she said with a nod to D-ko.

The android hit the switches, and the world dissolved around B-ko.



The world came back into focus for B-ko once again, and she found 
herself standing in a small chamber. It was obviously technologically 
advanced, and her suit&#39;s sensors detected a massive energy source 
nearby.

&quot;Cloak, on,&quot; B-ko whispered, activating her suit&#39;s new sensor cloak. No 
scanners would pick up her presence now, at least in theory. This was 
the first time she had tried it, however. She found a door and activated 
it, making her way out into a long hallway. Something lay on the ground 
by the door, and B-ko&#39;s eyes widened in alarm.

Carefully, B-ko picked up the ragged scraps of cloth, recognizing it as 
what was left of A-ko&#39;s school uniform. &#39;She was here,&#39; she thought, 
&#39;but is she still here now?&#39; A-ko normally didn&#39;t take to captivity very 
well at all, so B-ko would have thought the place would be a wreck in 
short order. But there were no signs of a struggle.

B-ko set her sensors to pick up A-ko&#39;s bio-signature, and got a lock 
shortly. &quot;Flight mode,&quot; B-ko ordered softly, and jetted down the hall 
towards the signal. She took the turns quickly, soaring along, and 
finally emerged into a large room to find...

A-ko sitting comfortably in front of a bank of monitor screens where, 
B-ko noted with some irritation, her progress had been seen every step 
of the way. &#39;Looks like it&#39;s back to the drawing board on the cloak,&#39; 
she thought.

&quot;Hey, B-ko,&quot; A-ko smiled at her, &quot;I was expecting you to get here days 
ago.&quot;

A-ko got out of her seat and B-ko blinked at the odd clothes her red 
haired friend was wearing. A blue T-shirt and pants, red boots, and a 
familiar looking stylized red &#39;S&#39; symbol on her chest. &quot;Is that what I 
think it is?&quot; B-ko found herself asking.

&quot;A compromise on the Supergirl outfit that my dad wanted me to wear,&quot; 
A-ko explained cheerfully, her arm bands catching the light. She walked 
over to where B-ko was standing, and quietly said, &quot;It&#39;s good to see a 
friendly face, B-ko.&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you call me?&quot; B-ko exclaimed, &quot;I though you were in trouble, 
too!&quot;

A-ko just grinned at her, &quot;I didn&#39;t call because I knew you were smart 
enough to be able to follow me up here.&quot;

&quot;Up here?&quot; B-ko echoed.

&quot;We&#39;re on the moon,&quot; A-ko started to explain.

B-ko got it in only seconds. &quot;We&#39;re up in the JLA base, the Watchtower,&quot; 
she said in hushed, almost reverent tones as she looked around. She 
frowned suddenly, &quot;But what are you doing up here in that outfit?&quot;

&quot;Because my Dad and Mom want me to take up the family business while 
they&#39;re out looking for C-ko,&quot; A-ko sighed, a large sweatdrop appearing 
on the side of her head. She looked around, &quot;Could you help me get this 
place back on-line? I could really use the help.&quot;

B-ko&#39;s eyes glittered as she considered the challenge, &quot;Difficult, but I 
could do it. I&#39;ll have to bring D-ko up to help, though.&quot;

&quot;D-ko?&quot; A-ko echoed in surprise. &quot;Oh,&quot; she said, &quot;I forgot to introduce 
you to the other person up here. Oracle?&quot;

A hologram of a red haired young woman in a wheel chair appeared. &quot;Hmm, 
is she the new Steel you were talking about?&quot; Oracle asked A-ko.

&quot;What?!&quot; B-ko exclaimed.</pre>
