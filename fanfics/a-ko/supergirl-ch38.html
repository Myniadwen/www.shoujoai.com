Oracle, the computer consciousness of the Watchtower,
let her artificial body&#39;s eyes flick from one member
of the new Justice League to another, unconsciously
reviewing their data and updating her personal files
on them.

Supergirl smiled slightly as she walked over to Steel,
&quot;Has Kestrel decided to go see her mother on
Themescria yet?&quot;

Steel smiled as she took off her helm, her long blue
hair flowing around her shoulders. &quot;Helena&#39;s still
debating when it would be best,&quot; she softly admitted,
&quot;but either way I&#39;m coming along with her.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Supergirl nodded, &quot;Kestrel&#39;s tough but she
still needs you.&quot;

&#39;Interesting,&#39; Oracle noted as she concentrated on her
work.

Supergirl, also known as A-ko and Laurel Kent.
Redheaded biological daughter of Superman and Wonder
Woman and raised both in man&#39;s world and on the amazon
isle of Themescria, she was a warrior without compare.
So far she had demonstrated most of the physical
capabilities of both her parents, including near
incalculable strength, durability, flight, and various
sensory abilities.

Steel, the armored heroine named Biko Daitokuji, sat
down in a chair at the council table nearby, her long
blue hair slightly limp from sweat. The daughter of
Hikaru Daitokuji and Lena Luthor, she inherited her
mother&#39;s genius in technology, producing advanced
armors in her former feud with A-ko.

A feud, like most feuds, over a woman, Oracle mused.
C-ko had seemed a normal blonde teen, except that
aliens had a tendency to kidnap the girl. Finally a
few months ago a all-female band of aliens succeeded
in taking her, a race we later learned was from
Almerac. C-ko was in fact the daughter of their ruler,
Maxima, sent to Earth to study exceptional beings like
A-ko and B-ko, and now it seemed she was coming back,
leading a army of her people in a artificial construct
called Warworld.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kestrel murmured, her purple cowl drawn back
to reveal black hair and her usual focused expression.

B-ko reached out to carefully squeeze Helena&#39;s hand,
&quot;Anything I can do...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll call,&quot; Kestrel agreed with somewhat more warmth.

Kestrel, garbed in her usual purple and black, sat
nearby B-ko as she grimly contemplated their current
situation. Helena Wayne was the child of three
superheroic legacies, her mother Nightstar being the
daughter of Nightwing and Starfire and her father
being Thomas Wayne, son of the Batman. Her own
reactions to all this have been rather mixed, with
Nightstar having abandoned her and being raised by the
Birds of Prey and adopting s heroic identity that
could best be described as a fusion of Batman and
Batgirl.

&quot;More coffee?&quot; the bouncy blonde asked as she went
around the table.

Mecha smiled cheerfully as the blonde android served
them all beverages, then D-ko took a seat nearby.
Originally built to be just a robot servant, B-ko had
upgraded her multiple times with onboard weaponry
quite the opposite of her warm personality. It was
that destructive capability that first carried her out
to the battlefield, but Oracle suspected it was bonds
of friendship that were keeping her there.

Martian Manhunter was a oddly calming presence,
considering he was a seven foot tall green alien.
J&#39;onn J&#39;onzz, the last known survivor of a ancient
Martian race, had been a member of multiple Justice
Leagues, and his Superman-like powers were certainly
an asset. Even more of an asset was his calm
leadership and cool head, taking the various twists
and turns their recent adventures had caused in
stride.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Martian Manhunter nodded to Mecha. A
impish look appeared in his eye, &quot;Do you have any
Oreos, by the way?&quot;

&quot;I can get some,&quot; Mecha smiled as she hopped up again.

&quot;Busy?&quot; a familiar voice asked.

Oracle smiled up at Kyla Scott as she answered the
dark green haired woman, &quot;Just thinking about things.&quot;

Kyla squeezed Oracle&#39;s shoulder as the Green Lantern
said, &quot;If I can help, let me know.&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; Oracle murmured fondly.

Kyla Scott, the current Green Lantern of Earth&#39;s
sector of space, was the daughter of Jade and the
Green Lantern Kyle Rayner, born of a romantic tryst
between the two of them before Kyle disappeared
mysteriously in the last great Crisis. Raised by Jade
she had learned about the Green Lanterns almost as
soon as she could read, and was accepted into the
Corps almost as soon as she could qualify.

There was a blur of movement as the Flash hurried by
as she excitedly told everyone,
&quot;Lunchhasbeenmade!We&#39;vegotcoldcuts,fishpate,someburgersandvegetablesslicedupfordipping!&quot;

&quot;Slow down a bit,&quot; Oracle chuckled softly, even though
she already understood what the Flash had said.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Flash blushed as she pushed her red costume&#39;s
cowl back. Iris West smiled, her sandy brown hair a
bit messy, &quot;Lunch has been finished. We&#39;ve got cold
cuts, fish pate, some burgers and vegetables sliced up
for dipping!&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Kyla grinned, &quot;you didn&#39;t cook it, did
you?&quot;

&quot;Hey, I can cook,&quot; Iris frowned at her friend.

Kyla snickered, &quot;Yeah, if it comes out of a box and
has instructions.&quot;

Iris gently bopped her in the head, &quot;Meanie.&quot;

The sixth incarnation of the Flash, Iris West was the
daughter of Wally West and his wife Linda. Born with
the potential for speed she had grown up with the
dream of being a Flash, even though her father
actively discouraged her. Originally Iris called
herself Kid Flash, but due to unknown reasons has
recently taken on the Flash Identity.

&quot;Hey, Iris,&quot; Firestorm smiled warmly, unearthly flames
crackling around the androgynous looking man&#39;s head.

&quot;Firestorm,&quot; Iris smiled happily, &quot;sit with me?&quot;

A faint blush colored Firestorm&#39;s cheeks as the red
and gold clad man took her hand and answered, &quot;I&#39;d be
glad to.&quot;

Firestorm was Rebecca Raymond, the daughter of the
original Firestorm. Some time before Ronnie Raymond
was stabbed by Shadow Thief, a godlike fire elemental
had been bonded to him, and somehow that elemental
restored him to life. Shaken by his death and rebirth
Ronnie retired, but unknowingly passed on the
Firestorm powers to his daughter.

&quot;Was the fish chosen deliberately for me?&quot; Orin, their
new Aqualad, asked with some amusement. Because he was
a resident of Atlantis Oracle knew very little about
him, though his red hair and water shaping powers made
her believe he might be connected to the former Queen
of Atlantis, Mera.

&quot;Luck of the draw,&quot; DR. Fate noted, her white hair
falling into her eyes.

Lyta Hall, the latest incarnation of Fate, was a hero
with a very checkered past. The daughter of the Golden
Age Fury she had adopted that identity along with the
other children of Golden Age heroes in Infinity Inc.
In the end her lover died and was reborn, she lost her
son and became a avatar of the true Furies, and
acquired the power of Fate in exchange for crushing
responsibility and misplaced guilt.

&quot;Anything to drink?&quot; Hawkwoman asked, the brown haired
warrior dressed in her modified Thangarian uniform.

&quot;I think we can rustle up something from when Orion of
the New Gods was here,&quot; D-ko offered cheerfully.

Katar Hohl was a refugee police officer from the
planet Thangar, a warrior who&#39;s parents had fought
beside the Justice League years ago. When a war party
rose on her planet and allied with Warworld to attack
Earth, she abandoned her home world to give a warning,
sacrificing her past and friendships there.

&quot;Everyone&#39;s still wary around me, I notice,&quot; the new
Black Canary murmured as she sat by Oracle, her blonde
hair shining.

&quot;They know you were a supervillain,&quot; Oracle shrugged,
&quot;give it time.&quot;

Black Canary made a face, &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll join Katar with
a drink.&quot;

Oracle watched Allison Queen stalk off with a sigh.
The daughter of Dinah Lance and Oliver Queen, Allison
had been put up for adoption as a babe, and growing up
was shuffled from one home to another due to her
inherited sonic powers. Adopting the name Vox she
became a small time villain, but decided to go
straight after finally meeting her biological mother.
Along with Barbara Gordon they devised a plot to put
Allison undercover, having her pose as a villain and
retrieve information on the underworld, a plan that
was recently derailed by a villain&#39;s powerful
telepathic scan.

&#39;So this is the Justice League,&#39; Oracle silently
mused, &#39;I hope we&#39;re going to be enough to do the
job.&#39;</pre>
