<h1>DC Universe 2045: Showcase (part 9 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../a-ko/index.html">Project A-ko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../a-ko/showcase-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>The blonde haired woman&#39;s hair had mostly gone to gray
but her stride was still athletic as she strode
through the corridors of the White House. She wasn&#39;t
traditionally beautiful looking, there was too much
strength in her face for that, but she certainly was
striking. She knocked on the door then headed inside
after being invited.

&quot;Mr. President,&quot; the blonde nodded formally, carrying
a set of files with her.

&quot;Director Chase,&quot; the older man looked up and smiled,
&quot;it&#39;s been awhile.&quot;

Cameron Chase smiled back as she took a seat, setting
the files down on the top of the desk. &quot;It&#39;s good to
see you, sir,&quot; the former agent of the Department of
Extranormal Operations said firmly.

&quot;What&#39;s the status of the Fortress captives?&quot; he asked
grimly.

&quot;Over eighty percent have been recaptured,&quot; Chase
reported before admitting, &quot;but most of the remaining
numbers are the major players, including Braniac,
Enchantress and others.&quot;

&quot;So we&#39;re not out of the woods yet,&quot; he sighed.

&quot;No, sir,&quot; Chase met his gaze calmly, &quot;has a decision
been made on my request, sir?&quot;

&quot;With some debate it&#39;s been decided to reactivate Task
Force X,&quot; the President of the United States answered
her crisply, &quot;as an umbrella organization containing
your DEO, Checkmate and the new Suicide Squad.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Chase nodded, &quot;we need some oversight on our
agencies.&quot; A ghost of a smile, &quot;And our liaison with
the White House is?&quot;

&quot;Nathaniel Adam,&quot; he answered, &quot;he has experience both
with the Task Force X and with some of the dirtier end
of our covert operations.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Chase noted the information calmly
before adding, &quot;I&#39;ll pass that on to the head of the
Task Force.&quot; She leaned forward, &quot;I&#39;ll give you an
overview of the briefing before the rest of the
cabinet arrives.&quot;

&quot;Carry on,&quot; the President nodded.

&quot;As you may know superheros never really stopped
operating,&quot; Chase began, &quot;they just became more covert
about it. Superman, Wonder Woman and others may have
saved the world several times in the last twenty
years, but the public has never known about it.&quot;

Chase flipped open a folder to show a blurred image of
the JLA Watchtower, &quot;Some weeks ago Superman and
Wonder Woman reappeared just long enough to retreat to
the Watchtower then take off in pursuit of an alien
vessel that attacked Earth and took at least one
hostage.&quot;

&quot;Do we know why the hostage was taken?&quot; the President
asked.

&quot;It&#39;s only conjecture at this point,&quot; Chase cautioned,
&quot;but we suspect the girl C-ko was an alien, one that
crashed at the site where Graviton City is now. Why
the aliens want her and how come they waited this long
are still unknown.&quot;

Chase moved the Watchtower photo aside to reveal a
redheaded girl in a familiar uniform, &quot;After that
their daughter A-ko began to appear in public as
Supergirl, drawing out other superhumans in the
process.&quot; She flashed a grin, &quot;And pulling me out of
retirement.&quot;

&quot;Any information on the identities if the members of
this new Justice League?&quot; he asked with a slight frown
on his face.

&quot;Not much yet,&quot; Chase conceded. &quot;Green Lantern has
been fairly easy, Kyla Scott has never really tried to
hide her heritage. We&#39;ve tentatively identified Flash
as Iris West, mostly due to her brother being the new
Professor Zoom, but it&#39;s not been confirmed yet. And
of course the third Steel is B-ko Daitokuji,&quot; she
finished.

&quot;And we can&#39;t move against her without annoying the
Japanese government,&quot; he noted before looking up to
meet her eyes. &quot;Well done,&quot; he smiled slightly.

&quot;My people have done their best to hit the ground
running on this,&quot; Chase answered, &quot;and on
investigating the other teams forming as well. Both
the Titans and Outsiders have reformed, and there&#39;s
rumblings that a third JSA may be in the making.&quot;

&quot;Combined with all the independent heroes out there
and it looks like things are getting exiting again,&quot;
he sighed.

Chase looked at him curiously, &quot;Is there a official
policy on the superhumans yet?&quot;

&quot;Based on your earlier reports and the recommendations
of my top advisors,&quot; he shrugged, &quot;we&#39;re choosing to
leave them be, for the time being.&quot; He fixed her with
an intense look, &quot;However, I want the DEO and others
keeping an eye on them. If any of the heroes begin to
cross the line we need to know soonest.&quot;

&quot;Understood, sir,&quot; Chase nodded.

The President got up, the two walking from the office
to the conference room. &quot;Has the United Nations made a
decision on the Justice League yet?&quot; he asked
curiously.

&quot;There&#39;s a resolution that&#39;s been put forward by the
Themescran ambassador Circe,&quot; Chase answered, &quot;to
grant the JLA special status. I suspect it&#39;ll pass.&quot;

&quot;I still can&#39;t believe that the Amazons could forgive
their ancient foe like that,&quot; the President shook his
head, referring to the sorceress and former villain
Circe. She had pulled some very nasty stuff on the
Amazons, so much that he found it hard to believe they
could put it aside so easily.

&quot;They preach peace and sisterhood,&quot; Chase said
cynically, &quot;they&#39;d look pretty hypocritical if they
didn&#39;t live up to it themselves.&quot;

&quot;Point,&quot; he acknowledged.

They reached the doors to the conference room and went
in Chase meeting the eyes of the White House inner
circle, the advisors and politicians that helped shape
the fate of a nation. As she took her place she had to
muse, &#39;And for this I gave up being a field agent?&#39;


&quot;I hate meetings,&quot; Chase muttered some hours later,
rubbing at her eyes tiredly. She sat in the director&#39;s
office at the DEO, her desk covered with computer and
paperwork, a few momentous of her cases scattered
around the room.

&#39;Better try this now than wait,&quot; Chase sighed as she
booted up her computer, quickly connecting to a remote
facility and hitting enter. &quot;Hope our internal
firewall is as good as the tech boys say it is,&quot; she
muttered softly.

The image formed on the computer screen in a moment, a
stylized mask of an oracle. &quot;Director Chase,&quot; Oracle
said formally, her voice a bit tinny through the older
computer&#39;s built in speakers, &quot;we finally meet.&quot;

&quot;How do you know who I am?&quot; Chase blinked in surprise.

&quot;Batman had an extensive file on you,&quot; Oracle answered
simply, &quot;one that he backed up in the Watchtower
mainframe. I&#39;ve since added to it, of course.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Chase echoed. She forced herself to focus
on business, &quot;I contacted you to propose an exchange
of information, a commodity I understand you value.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Oracle didn&#39;t give anything away.

&quot;The DEO has maintained extensive files on the super
criminals operating in the United States and abroad,&quot;
Chase said simply, &quot;I&#39;m willing to pass that data on
to you in exchange for one thing: the personal data on
the new Justice League.&quot;

&quot;Not interested,&quot; Oracle said crisply.

Before she could break the connection Chase said, &quot;Not
even in learning the current status of the Joker?&quot; In
the long silence that followed Chase added, &quot;I&#39;m aware
that you&#39;ve involved yourself in Joker related
incidents several times over the years, even with
superhumans that you wouldn&#39;t normally choose to work
with.&quot;

&quot;An empty offer,&quot; Oracle finally said, &quot;I know where
Joker is, I have a constant video feed from his prison
to entertain me.&quot; She actually sounded amused as she
said, &quot;Good try, though.&quot;

&quot;I had to try,&quot; Chase shrugged.

&quot;Now I have something to tell you,&quot; Oracle sounded
serious, &quot;advise the government to stay away from the
Justice League. I&#39;m well aware of some of the dirty
deeds done over the years, including the Mockingbird
sanction, the Major Force project and others, and I&#39;d
quite happily spill the beans if needed.&quot; With that,
she abruptly disconnected.

Once Oracle was gone Chase hit a switch, bringing up
the video feed from another part of the building and
asked, &quot;Any luck back tracking into her system?&quot;

&quot;Yes and no,&quot; Razorsharp answered, the criminal
computer hacker temporarily on loan from the Suicide
Squad. She sighed, &quot;As far as I can tell, Oracle is
operating out of the Watchtower itself.&quot;

&quot;Fits,&quot; Chase admitted, &quot;so no chance of getting any
information from Oracle&#39;s system?&quot;

&quot;Not with the Martian, Kryptonian and Thangarian tech
in there,&quot; Razorsharp answered before admitting, &quot;in
fact, I think that Oracle got some of our data, even
with all the firewalls.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Chase shook her head with a sigh.</pre>
