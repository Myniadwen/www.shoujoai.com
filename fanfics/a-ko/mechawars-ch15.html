<h1>Mecha Wars (part 15 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../a-ko/index.html">Project A-ko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../a-ko/mechawars-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>        Linna grinned as she settled down at the counter beside Priss. 
She looked up at the waitress&#39; name tag, &quot;Hey, Excel, can I get a 
burger, fries and shake?&quot;

        &quot;No problem,&quot; the blonde said cheerfully, and scampered off.

        &quot;So how&#39;s your week been going?&quot; Priss asked her with a little 
smile.

        &quot;They already know,&quot; Linna admitted.

        &quot;What, all four of them?&quot; Priss blinked, wondering if they 
were actually talking about the Angelic Layer champions.

        &quot;They saw me fighting with an Angel,&quot; Linna explained to her, 
&quot;and realized that I was the same person in the green KS armor.&quot;

        Priss shook her head, &quot;After fighting with Hikaru, I&#39;m really 
not surprised.&quot;

        A dark haired girl appeared, dropping off the two fully loaded 
plates for Priss and Linna. Her face went an odd shade of green, then 
she just toppled over. As both women looked at her in alarm, the girl 
began to snake- crawl her way across the crowded club floor.

        &quot;What the hell?&quot; Linna blinked.

        &quot;I thought you two would be used to her by now,&quot; the tall, 
orange haired woman noted. Both ladies looked at her blankly so she 
smiled wryly, &quot;Your first time here?&quot;

        &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m Priss, this is my friend Linna,&quot; she introduced 
them both before looking up at the woman curiously.

        &quot;Arisugawa Juri,&quot; the tall woman nodded, &quot;welcome to the 
Locket.&quot; As she walked away they heard her mutter softly, &quot;Three 
different versions of them?&quot;

        Linna blinked a few times, then looked over at Priss, &quot;Did 
that seem odd to you?&quot;

        &quot;Yep,&quot; Priss sighed before digging in to her food.

        Linna bit into her own burger and sighed happily, &quot;That&#39;s 
good.&quot; She looked over at Priss and asked, &quot;So how&#39;s your Aunt?&quot;

        &quot;Not like any Aunt I ever met,&quot; Priss chuckled, &quot;can you 
believe that she went to one of my concerts the other night?&quot;

        &quot;Now I have to meet her,&quot; Linna laughed softly.

        As Priss happily munched on a French fry she looked 
thoughtful, &quot;Yeah, maybe now is the right time. At least we don&#39;t have 
to worry about boomer trouble, with all our suits in repair.&quot; At 
Linna&#39;s questioning glance she explained sheepishly, &quot;I told them a 
bit about all of us, and now they want to meet you.&quot;

        &quot;Sylia did say you could have them over at the Silky Doll one 
night,&quot; Linna said with a smile. She frowned slightly, &quot;That reminds 
me, we&#39;re supposed to go over there to talk about the upgrades later 
today, right?&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s the plan,&quot; Priss nodded. She looked at Linna curiously 
and asked, &quot;You need a ride over there or something?&quot;

        &quot;Oh, no,&quot; Linna said quite quickly, &quot;not the way you ride that 
motorbike! Once was enough.&quot; She shuddered, remembering a quite 
harrowing ride she had shared with her one night. The speed was bad 
enough, not to mention the way she drove!

        They paid for their meals, carefully making their way through 
the crowd of young women. They passed the bouncer who gave them a 
casual wave, and Priss collected her &#39;bike from where it was leaning 
directly under the neon sign, &#39;Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.&#39;

        Priss snickered softly, &quot;Wimp.&quot;

        &quot;Am not,&quot; Linna protested even as Priss drove away. She got 
into her sporty compact car and was off, merging into the traffic 
crowded streets of Mega-Tokyo.

        In another part of the city, the hotel district in fact, up in 
one of the highest priced penthouse suites. In the master bedroom, 
laying atop a very large bed, two figures are rising quite late in the 
day. The one woman is older, a bit of gray in her hair, while the 
woman resting contentedly in her arms is only in her late twenties, at 
best.

        Akiko gently pushed Nene&#39;s hair away from her pretty face, 
looking down at the girl tenderly. &#39;How did I get myself into this 
mess?&#39; she thought to herself sadly, &#39;There&#39;s no way she would ever 
want to stay with me.&#39;

        Nene&#39;s eyes gradually opened, and she smiled a slow, sexy 
little smile. &quot;Good morning,&quot; she said happily. She stretched up 
suddenly, and gently stole a kiss from the startled Akiko&#39;s lips. &quot;Do 
you feel as wonderful as I do?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;It&#39;s afternoon,&quot; Akiko smiled back and a bit of a flush 
appeared on her cheeks, &quot;and most definitely yes.&quot; She paused, 
&quot;Nene...&quot;

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Nene asked her quietly.

        &quot;I don&#39;t want this to be just a one night thing,&quot; Akiko said 
softly, looking away from her shyly. &#39;I shouldn&#39;t even ask her,&#39; she 
thought, &#39;she&#39;ll just say...&#39;

        &quot;Neither do I,&quot; Nene said firmly. She took Akiko&#39;s hands in 
hers, staring into her eyes, &quot;I care for you a great deal.&quot; A wry 
little smile, &quot;I might even love you, though I hope you don&#39;t mind 
that I&#39;m too chicken to say that right now.&quot;

        Akiko puffed out a breath of relief, &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot;

        Nene hugged her, then drew back. She was about to say 
something more when she got a good look at the clock. &quot;Oh my god,&quot; she 
squeaked out, &quot;I&#39;m SO late!&quot; She looked around wildly, then began to 
scramble around trying to find her clothes.

        Akiko tried not to laugh, and picked up a pair of lacy 
panties, &quot;Looking for these?&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Nene grabbed at them then hopped about the room 
getting them on. She picked up her pink bra, struggling with it a bit 
before turning it all the way backward, closing the clip, and then 
turning it back around.

        &quot;What are you late for?&quot; Akiko asked, adding, &quot;You don&#39;t work 
today, do you?&quot;

        &quot;No work,&quot; Nene agreed, &quot;but I promised my friends I&#39;d meet 
them after lunch today.&quot; She grinned at Akiko, &quot;but other than that, 
my day&#39;s free.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Akiko smiled. She hesitated, then offered, &quot;If you 
want, I could give you a ride.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Nene smiled at her happily, &quot;we&#39;re meeting over at 
the Silky Doll.&quot;

        They both finished getting dressed in just a few minutes, then 
headed downstairs to the parkade where Akiko picked up her sports car. 
Then they slipped out of the building and off into traffic, talking 
together softly.

        &quot;I&#39;m sort of glad Nuku-Nuku and Emi went out early this 
morning,&quot; Akiko chuckled, &quot;otherwise they&#39;d want to come along.&quot;

        &quot;That wouldn&#39;t be so bad,&quot; Nene laughed, &quot;I do like the two of 
them.&quot;

        &quot;So what do you want to do today?&quot; Akiko asked her curiously.

        Nene blushed faintly, &quot;To be honest, more of what we did last 
night.&quot;

        &quot;That, I can promise you,&quot; Akiko gave her a naughty smile. 
They pulled up to the Silky Doll and Nene got out, going around to 
Akiko&#39;s side of the car. &quot;I&#39;ll be back here in an hour or so, to pick 
you up?&quot; she asked Nene.

        &quot;I&#39;ll be waiting,&quot; and Nene leaned into the open window to 
give Akiko a farewell kiss.

        &quot;Well, isn&#39;t that interesting,&quot; Sylia said to Tony softly as 
they watched the goings on from an upper floor window. &quot;Do you think 
Akiko and Nene are still just friends?&quot; she asked archly.

        &quot;I wouldn&#39;t bet on it,&quot; Tony snickered. She turned away from 
the window to walk over to Linna, Priss and Mackie and reported, 
&quot;Looks like Nene has arrived.&quot;

        &quot;About time,&quot; Priss grumbled.

        Linna jabbed her delicately in the ribs, &quot;Give the girl a 
break, she went out with Akiko last night.&quot; Softly, &quot;And I&#39;ve heard 
she didn&#39;t go home to sleep!&quot;

        Priss raised her eyebrow and asked, &quot;Does that mean we have to 
send Akiko a toaster for converting her?&quot;

        Sylia laughed softly, while everyone else stared at Priss 
blankly. &quot;Old joke,&quot; Sylia explained.

        The door slid open, Nene staggered into the living room and 
gasped out, &quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot; She felt everyone&#39;s gazes on her and blinked, 
&quot;What?&quot;

        &quot;Did you and Akiko have a nice time last night?&quot; Priss asked 
with a rakish little smile.

        Nene went beet red.

        &quot;Now, now, no teasing poor Nene,&quot; Sylia said in her 
business-like way as she activated a monitor screen. &quot;Let&#39;s get the 
meeting done with,&quot; she added with a little smile, &quot;so that she can 
get back to her girlfriend.&quot;

        &quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; the blushing Nene muttered.

        &quot;The reason we called this meeting,&quot; Sylia continued, &quot;was to 
give you all an idea of what to expect from the hard suit upgrades.&quot; 
She brought up a basic schematic of a generic &#39;suit and said, &quot;Most of 
the changes have been small, but will have a great overall effect on 
the suits functions.&quot;

        Tony stepped up on cue, &quot;One of the major changes we made was 
in the armor. We&#39;re using a new material that is both lighter and 
stronger than the previous alloy.&quot;

        &quot;Which means the suits will be tougher,&quot; Mackie jumped in 
enthusiastically, &quot;and even stronger because they won&#39;t be carrying so 
much weight along with them.&quot;

        Linna looked up at the roof casually, &quot;Now if we could just 
get Nene to lose some weight.&quot;

        &quot;Hey!&quot; Nene protested.

        Sylia smiled slightly at that, then she looked fondly at her 
lover, &quot;With Tony&#39;s assistance we&#39;ve also boosted the flight 
capabilities of the suits substantially. Most of the other 
improvements are based around simply upgrading the existing systems.&quot;

        The meeting began to wind down a bit, and Priss walked over to 
ask Sylia nervously, &quot;Could I ask you a question?&quot;

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Sylia tipped her head to the side curiously.

        &quot;Were you being serious when you said I could bring Natsumi 
and her friends over to the &#39;Doll?&quot; Priss asked.

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Sylia smiled, &quot;I&#39;ve been wanting to meet them 
myself!&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Priss smiled, &quot;I was thinking we could hold another 
party, I&#39;d like them to meet everybody if we could.&quot;

        There was a general chorus of agreement from the others, then 
Nene spoke up, &quot;Would it be all right if I brought Akiko with me?&quot;

        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Priss looked at Nene closely, &quot;getting serious about 
her, are we?&quot;

        Nene blushed fiercely, &quot;Yes.&quot;

        Far away from the friends, the Genom tower reached up towards 
the sky. In a office in the heart of the facility, a very irritable 
Quincy received his employees report.

        &quot;There&#39;s still been no sign of the Steel Angel?&quot; Quincy 
demanded.

        Madigan nodded, &quot;Not since the first reported sighting, sir.&quot; 
She tentatively asked, &quot;Is capturing it really that important?&quot;

        Quincy scowled fiercely, &quot;It&#39;s reported power levels are far 
beyond any boomer design we&#39;ve created, including the so called 
&#39;super-boomers.&#39; If we could disassemble it, study the technology...&quot;

        &quot;We can&#39;t afford to increase the patrols any more,&quot; Madigan 
sighed, &quot;B-ko and Nuku-Nuku have destroyed too many of our boomers 
already.&quot;

        Quincy grit his teeth, &quot;Then we&#39;ll sell some more of my 
stock!&quot;

        Madigan looked at her boss worriedly and cautioned him, &quot;That 
means you and your allies will have less than fifty percent of the 
stock.&quot;

        Quincy dismissed that, &quot;No one person owns the stock, I&#39;ve 
checked.&quot;

        Madigan didn&#39;t look very reassured, &quot;Yes sir.&quot; Silently she 
resolved, &#39;Hope you don&#39;t mind if I go check that out myself?&#39;

Author&#39;s Note: Yes, that was an appearance of my x-over series 
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket. For those that don&#39;t read that series, it&#39;s a bar 
for anime lesbians run by Arisugawa Juri from Revolutionary Girl 
Utena. Excel and Hyatt, the two waitresses, are from Excel Saga.
