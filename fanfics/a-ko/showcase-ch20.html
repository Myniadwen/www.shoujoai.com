The Metropolis branch of Scientific and Technological
Advanced Research Laboratories was jumping as the
first alarms came in, the massive object at the edge
of the solar system showing up on all their sensors.
Men and women worked quickly to confirm the data,
using satelites and sensors set up for dozens of
scientific projects throughout the reaches of space.

&quot;Yes Mr. President,&quot; Dr. Kitty Faulkner said, her
brown and grey hair falling into her eyes, &quot;we&#39;ve
confirmed the planetoid&#39;s arrival. The information the
Justice League provided us has all checked out
perfectly.&quot;

The older man looked pensive as he sat back in the
monitor image. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said, &quot;though I almost
wish you had said it was a hoax.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Kitty smiled slightly, &quot;the gravitational
anomolies that a mass like that generates are very
destinctive.&quot;

The President nodded gravely, &quot;Keep me updated.&quot;

With that they signed off, then Kitty got up and left
her office. The STAR Labs branch was noisy as people
hurried too and fro as Kitty made her way down the
halls, eventually reaching the main monitoring womb.
Here, researchers accessed data and pulled together
information, hurrying from station to station and
speaking together excitedly.

Dr. Louise Lincoln, the former supervillain Killer
Frost, excitedly studied the data on Warworld&#39;s
arrival. &quot;Was that a hyperspace exit,&quot; she wondered,
her lighter brown hair falling into her eyes, &quot;or
possibly a Boom Tube?&quot;

Dr Doris Zeul frowned, the redheaded eccentric leaning
over as she read. &quot;It doesn&#39;t match the data we got on
Kaliback&#39;s attack on Metropolis using a Boom Tube,&quot;
she noted. Looking up towards a monitor screen she
asked, &quot;Hamilton?&quot;

Professor Emil Hamilton nodded grimly from his prison
cell in the Slab. The grey haired villain said, &quot;I&#39;d
expect it was warp transit, though how they managed it
with a mass that size I don&#39;t know. I hope the Justice
League captures it intact so we can study it.&quot;

The bitter tone in Hamilton&#39;s voice made Kitty shake
her head sadly. Once upon a time Hamilton had been one
of Superman&#39;s closest allies, but jealousy over what
he percieved as another taking his place drove him to
villainy. As Ruin he tried to destroy Superman, nearly
succeeding in killing his loved ones before Superman
finally defeated him.

&quot;That&#39;s assuming the Justice League can stop it,&quot;
Doris noted, her mixed feelings about the situation
evident in her voice.

Years ago Doris Zeul had been dying of a rare blood
disease and had attempted to use a mind swapping
device to take over the healthy body of Wonder Woman.
Defeated she first transferred her mind into a gorilla
then into the comatose body of a circus strong woman,
eventually adopting the identity of Giganta.

Kitty smiled wryly as she remarked, &quot;They have to, or
the Earth is going to be serving whoever&#39;s on that
thing.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Louise agreed. She looked around, &quot;Anyone
manage to get any internal scans of that thing?&quot;

&quot;Not yet,&quot; Veronica Cale said, communicating from the
facility based on Oolong Island, a sort of refuge for
mad scientists. The beautiful blonde executive shook
her head wryly, &quot;Whatever that thing&#39;s hull is made
from, it&#39;s nearly impervious to conventional sensors.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s get unconventional,&quot; Hamilton used his
artificial arm to scratch at his beard, &quot;do any of
your science boys have a more exotic scanner, Cale?&quot;

Veronica looked thoughtful, &quot;I&#39;ll round up the boys
and let you know. Supposedly TO Morrow has time
viewing technology, that might help.&quot;

&quot;Have we got the uplink to Will Magnus&#39; lab yet?&quot;
Kitty wondered.

&quot;Sounds like Magnus has had another nervous
breakdown,&quot; Louise said regretfully, &quot;he&#39;s calling
himself Veridium and claiming he&#39;s a metal man.&quot;

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Kitty sighed.

&quot;The good news is, he&#39;s more creative in this state,&quot;
Doris noted optimistically.

&quot;Last time he was like this he created a Plutonium Man
and nearly destroyed New Jersey,&quot; Kitty pointed out,
&quot;I don&#39;t think we want that again.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Louise acknowledged.

&#145;When did Star Labs become a refuge for former super
villains?&#39; Kitty thought to herself with some
amusement.

&quot;I&#39;m here,&quot; Lena Luthor hurried in, the redheaded
business woman shrugging off her jacket, &quot;how can I
help?&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am, slow down,&quot; Jessica Olsen complained, grabbing
her boss&#39; coat as the freckled, orange haired woman
kept pace.

&quot;Good to see you,&quot; Doris nodded.

&quot;We could use a hand in scanning through Warworld&#39;s
outer shell,&quot; Louise suggested as they cleared a work
space for the new arrival.

Lena tied in to the computers back at Lexcorp as she
asked, &quot;Has anyone tried a neutron beam as a probe?&quot;

&quot;Do you have one?&quot; Kitty blinked.

&quot;Daddy dearest,&quot; Lena said sarcasticly, &quot;built one as
a weapon against the Justice League.&quot; She typed
quickly, &quot;If I turn it towards Warworld and properly
modulate the beam...&quot;

&quot;Best drop the power level a bit more,&quot; Doris quickly
noted, &quot;or their shields will just decide it&#39;s an
attack and bounce it away.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the reminder,&quot; Lena admitted.

&quot;Anyone need coffee or refreshments?&quot; Jessica asked.
She smiled at her boss, &quot;Black, two sugars as usual?&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Lena nodded as the others ordered.

Despite his history with the Luthor family Hamilton
also pitched in, helping come up with a means of
interpretating the data. &quot;All right,&quot; Hamilton said as
a graphic began to appear on the screen, &quot;that should
do it.&quot;

&quot;Remarkable,&quot; Kitty muttered as they studied the
image.

Warworld, despite it&#39;s imposing appearance, wasn&#39;t
solid. It resembled a colony ship of fiction, with
enormous open areas within presumedly set up with
earthlike conditions. It&#39;s outer layer was made up of
metals previously only seen in star ships, studded
with unknown offensive and defensive systems.

&quot;I&#39;d estimate it could support an entire planetary
population in there,&quot; Doris mused, &quot;assuming they are
also serving as the crew.&quot;

&quot;That fits,&quot; Kitty agreed. She looked over at Lena
then at Hamilton&#39;s image, &quot;Any chance we can determine
the actual population of the ship?&quot;

&quot;The neutron beam isn&#39;t that precise,&quot; Lena shook her
head.

Hamilton nodded, &quot;Besides, to even try we&#39;d have to up
the power, making the beam more detectable and not
incidentally harming any life forms we sweep with it.&quot;

&quot;They are invading our planet,&quot; Doris said to them
dryly, &quot;I really don&#39;t object to frying a few of them
for data.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rather save the neutron beam for later,&quot; Kitty
pointed out, &quot;we might need it as a weapon if things
get bad.&quot;

&quot;Humph,&quot; Doris pouted.

They worked for a while improving their model of the
interior of Warworld, including where readings
indicated where the engines and larger weapons
emplacements might be. &quot;All right,&quot; Kitty finally said
as night began falling, &quot;I&#39;ll package up what we&#39;ve
got and send it to the government and the League.&quot;

&quot;Dr. Faulkner?&quot; Lena said as she was leaving.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Kitty looked curious.

&quot;Could I speak to you, Louise and Doris once you&#39;re
done?&quot; Lena asked.

&quot;Certainly,&quot; Kitty agreed. She returned to her office
and sent the report to all the required parties, then
headed to the cafeteria where the others had arranged
to meet.

&quot;Does anyone have some beer?&quot; a visibly tired Doris
wondered, &quot;After that much work, I want a cold one.&quot;

&quot;Maybe later,&quot; Kitty sounded amused.

Lena Luthor smiled somewhat seriously as she said, &quot;I
think we all know what&#39;s going to happen when Warworld
arrives?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ll hit the major cities like Metropolis,&quot; Louise
said, &quot;obviously.&quot;

Lena nodded, &quot;I&#39;m certain the army and police will do
all they can, but I was thinking we could also offer
them a hand.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Doris sounded displeased.

&quot;I know Giganta is in retirement,&quot; Lena nodded to
Doris then looked at Kitty, &quot;as is your alter ego,
Rampage. But all our lives are on the line if the
aliens attack.&quot;

&quot;And what are you going to do?&quot; Louise asked
curiously.

Lena smiled wryly, &quot;I plan to borrow a Lexcorp battle
armor and do all I can.&quot;

&quot;If you do,&quot; Louise smiled slightly, &quot;my frosty alter
ego will be there too.&quot;

&quot;So will Rampage,&quot; Kitty agreed.

&quot;Doris?&quot; Lena smiled.

&quot;Are you nuts?&quot; Doris laughed, &quot;I intend to be on the
first train out of town.&quot;</pre>
