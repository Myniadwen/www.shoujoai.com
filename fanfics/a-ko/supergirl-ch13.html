<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 13 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../a-ko/index.html">Project A-ko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../a-ko/supergirl-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>        Instead of going over to her desk Lena lead them over to a 
meeting table set off to one side of the spacious office. On the round 
table some snacks had been laid out and a refreshments cart was sitting 
nearby them. Lena waved to the seats and said, &quot;Sit on down, I just need 
to take care of a few things before I join you.&quot;

        B-ko took a seat, wondering if this really was such a good idea. 
She had been quite startled to pick up the phone and hear her mother&#39;s 
voice on the other end. In all honestly, she really hadn&#39;t been 
expecting her to call at all. They had talked awkwardly for a bit, when 
Lena had tentatively suggested that they talk face to face.

        &quot;You all right?&quot; A-ko asked softly, &quot;you&#39;re awfully pale.&quot;

        B-ko smiled back wryly, &quot;I&#39;ll manage.&quot;

        Lena finished quietly ordering her secretary to hold any but her 
most urgent calls while turning just slightly to watch her daughter and 
her friend talk, doing it as discretely as she possibly could. The two 
of them had a casual closeness about them, a sense of long familiarity. 
&#39;I wonder if they&#39;re lovers?&#39; she thought.

        Lena walked over, &quot;Several of my employees asked about coming up 
to thank you personally for saving them, but I wasn&#39;t sure if you&#39;d like 
that.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; A-ko smiled up at her, &quot;I&#39;m still not quite used to 
all this.&quot;

        &quot;You both seem to be handling things quite well,&quot; Lena said with 
a smile as she settled down in a seat by the two of them.

        &quot;We&#39;re coping,&quot; B-ko said quietly. &quot;Mother,&quot; she said, then 
stopped. &quot;That&#39;s going to take some getting used to,&quot; she murmured.

        Lena actually chuckled softly, &quot;Tell me about it.&quot;

        The tension in the room seemed to ease off a bit, both mother 
and daughter exchanging more relaxed smiles. B-ko tilted her head to the 
side, looking up at her mother curiously, &quot;Where did you get that big 
laser cannon you used to help us against the battledroids?&quot;

        &quot;I just re-rigged a medical laser we were testing,&quot; Lena 
shrugged casually.

        B-ko leaned forward intently, &quot;But I thought those were 
notoriously low powered?&quot;

        &quot;Swapped in additional batteries,&quot; Lena shrugged casually, &quot;and 
took off the limiters.&quot;

        &quot;And to prevent overheating?&quot; B-ko asked, &quot;That&#39;s the biggest 
problem I have with weapons on my battle suits.&quot;

        A somewhat bemused A-ko watched the two descending into pure 
techno- babble and just had to smile. They were so alike it was almost 
scary.

        High above the east coast cities it soared, a streak of vibrant 
green. Bobbing and weaving, it clearly enjoyed the newly granted power 
of fight. Kyla Scott laughed, the power ring lighting up the new Green 
Lantern&#39;s face as she streaked towards her destination.

        &quot;New York to Keystone City in seconds,&quot; Kyla grinned, &quot;this ring 
is so cool!&quot;

        Kyla dropped down to land on a Keystone office building, gazing 
over the edge thoughtfully. &#39;No sign of her,&#39; she thought. &#39;All right, 
assume she&#39;s patrolling the city at her usual speed, starting from the 
other end of town, it means she&#39;d get here right about...&#39;

        &quot;Kyla!&quot; a happy voice cried.

        &#39;.. now.&#39; Kyla thought, feeling her friend enveloping her in a 
fierce hug even as she was hugging her back happily, &quot;Hi, Iris.&quot;

&quot;Ohwowyou&#39;reaGreenLantern,Iknewyoucoulddoit!Butwhydidn&#39;tyoucallmeorletmeknow 
Iwassowiorriedaboutyou!Stillthatsuitdoeslookgoodonyouareyougoingtocustomizei 
tlikeyourdad&#39;sor,&quot; Iris West, also known as the Flash, speed talked away 
happily.

        &quot;Woah, back up and run it again slower,&quot; Kyla laughed at her old 
friend.

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Iris pushed back her red cowl, revealing brown eyes and 
sandy hair. &quot;I knew you would become a Green Lantern eventually,&quot; she 
smiled at her friend fondly.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Kyla blushed slightly even as she used her ring to 
remove her mask. She looked at the costume her friend was wearing and 
noted, &quot;You&#39;re not wearing your Kid Flash suit anymore. Does that mean 
you&#39;re...&quot;

        &quot;Flash, yeah,&quot; Iris nodded. She scowled suddenly, &quot;I didn&#39;t hear 
from you in weeks! Why didn&#39;t you call me at least!&quot;

        &quot;Well, I did leave a note with my boss,&quot; Kyla said weakly.

        &quot;Guy? That old pervert?! You know I don&#39;t go near him,&quot; Iris 
scowled.

        &quot;Oh come on, just because he tried to grab your ass that one 
time does not necessarily make him a pervert,&quot; Kyla tried to defend her 
boss. An impish little smile appeared on her face, &quot;It could just mean 
he has good taste.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;d know,&quot; Iris smirked.

        Kyla chuckled softly. She&#39;d come out to Iris last year, and 
except for the occasional good-natured tease Iris had taken it rather 
well. She sat down on a power ring created chair, forming one for Iris 
as she did so, &quot;Any luck chasing the boys?&quot;

        &quot;Chasing the boys, ha-ha,&quot; Iris said dryly.

        &quot;Unintentional, I assure you,&quot; Kyla grinned.

        &quot;No dating prospects,&quot; Iris shook her head with a sigh. She 
frowned slightly, hearing an alarm going off. A flicker of movement, 
then she was back in her seat and a criminal found himself tied up with 
a little bow for the Keystone Police department.

        &quot;Nice,&quot; Kyla gave her an admiring smile. Not really noticing her 
friend&#39;s blush she continued, &quot;Any progress with your brother?&quot;

        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Iris sighed, &quot;but all in the wrong direction. He&#39;s gone 
from being a slacker to being a super villain under the name Prof. 
Zoom.&quot;

        Kyla chortled softly at that, &quot;Prof. Zoom?!&quot;

        &quot;Dumb name I know,&quot; Iris was grave as she added, &quot;but the 
original Professor Zoom was a killer. He even murdered the second 
Flash&#39;s wife, my namesake.&quot;

        Kyla winced, &quot;Open mouth, insert foot.&quot; Running her hand through 
her dark green hair she quietly added, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Iris.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Iris smiled back, &quot;you wouldn&#39;t have known.&quot;

        &quot;I hate to interrupt your conversation ladies,&quot; the cool voice 
said, &quot;but I&#39;d like to speak to you about a matter of some importance.&quot;

        Iris was on her feet with her Flash cowl back in place in a 
second even as Kyla leapt up, her power ring blazing, ready to go. Then 
both froze as they instantly recognized the figure standing there, 
gazing at them calmly.

        &quot;Martian Manhunter,&quot; Kyla said softly.

        &quot;Indeed,&quot; J&#39;onn nodded, &quot;I was wondering if the two of you would 
be willing to join us up at the Watchtower. We&#39;d like to find out if 
you&#39;re interested in joining the Justice League.&quot;</pre>
