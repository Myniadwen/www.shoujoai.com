<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 27 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../a-ko/index.html">Project A-ko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../a-ko/supergirl-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>A-ko rose, smiling, the Supergirl uniform flowing over
her graceful form. &quot;I&#39;d like to call this meeting of
the Justice League to order,&quot; she said gravely, &quot;and
introduce the new members we were talking about
earlier. From the Justice Society as well as being a
former leaguer, I&#39;d like to introduce Lyta Hall, the
latest Dr. Fate.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m honored you&#39;d have me,&quot; Lyta said, her
distinctive blue and gold uniform gleaming, &quot;and I
have some information to pass on, too.&quot;

&quot;And here is Orin of Atlantis,&quot; A-ko hesitated, &quot;what
do you want to be called, by the way?&quot;

Orin shook his head, red hair falling into amused
eyes. &quot;I suppose I&#39;m stuck with Aqualad,&quot; he said,
&quot;don&#39;t hold it against me, please.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll try not to,&quot; D-ko smiled, handing out snacks
before taking a seat, the blonde battle robot looking
on with interest.

&quot;So what&#39;s the information?&quot; Kestrel asked intently,
studying Fate thoughtfully.

&quot;According to Madame Xanadu there is a great evil
coming,&quot; Dr. Fate addressed the League, &quot;not from
Earth, but spawned here somehow. Arising from the twin
daughters of light and shadow, reaching out in
conquest from the stars.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s helpful,&quot; A-ko blinked, her red hair falling
into her eyes. She frowned, &quot;Does the lady always talk
in riddles?&quot;

&quot;From what I&#39;ve heard, yes,&quot; Oracle answered wryly,
the younger woman sitting in one of the chairs at the
circular meeting table. More often than not the Oracle
program was using her robotic bodies, something the
league members were still getting used to. She smiled
as she looked over at Green Lantern and softly said,
&quot;Nicely done, convincing her to join.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Kyla Scott blushed faintly, her green
hair falling into her eyes. The green uniform clung to
her body, the power ring glimmering on her finger.

Flash fought back a smile, sipping at a drink through
a straw. The red clad speedster sat nearby Firestorm,
talking with the young man as they compared notes
about their respective missions. &quot;Do we know who the
twin daughters might be?&quot; she asked, sandy hair
falling into her eyes as her cowl lay against her
neck.

Sitting in the chair that belonged to Aquaman the
Atlantian Orin looked around in awe. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he said
with a shrug.

&quot;Could be almost anyone,&quot; Firestorm offered, red and
gold flames dancing around his head. The oddly
unearthly look that the hero had was emphasized by his
white eyes and the smooth androgyny of his body.

Steel leaned forward, her armor gleaming. &quot;This all
began with C-ko&#39;s kidnapping,&quot; the blue haired
aristocrat offered, &quot;she might be one of the
daughters.&quot;

&quot;Or maybe not,&quot; Kestrel murmured, her expression
thoughtful, &quot;maybe she&#39;s just connected to them.&quot; The
black and purple costume gave her a grim aspect,
coupled with a manner that she deliberately echoed
from Batman.

&quot;You have an idea?&quot; J&#39;onn J&#39;onzz asked, the green
skinned alien looking at her curiously. He maintained
a mostly human look for the convenience of his friends
and allies, but the Martian Manhunter clearly wasn&#39;t
human.

&quot;You mind if I talk about...,&quot; Kestrel looked at
Steel.

Steel frowned, then her eyes widened. &quot;Yes,&quot; she
murmured, looking mildly stunned by the idea that
Kestrel had suggested to her.

&quot;As most of you know Supergirl is the daughter of
Superman, one of the greatest forces of good in this
century,&quot; Kestrel said quietly, &quot;while Steel is the
granddaughter of Lex Luthor, one of the century&#39;s
greatest villains.&quot;

&quot;You think they&#39;re the daughters of light and shadow?&quot;
Dr. Fate raised a delicate eyebrow, her white hair
flowing around her face.

&quot;It fits, almost disturbingly so,&quot; Steel quietly
acknowledged, &quot;but I still don&#39;t get how C-ko factors
into the threat?&quot;

&quot;I almost wish I had met this C-ko,&quot; Kyla confided to
Iris West, &quot;at least I could have done a scan with my
ring and determined exactly where she came from.&quot;

&quot;Too bad you can&#39;t use the ring to travel back and
time and do so,&quot; Flash sighed. Iris took another
drink, &quot;The Guardians forbade that, right?&quot;

&quot;After everything happened with Parallax, yeah,&quot; Kyla
agreed.

&quot;No point crying over the past,&quot; Oracle said firmly.
She hesitated, &quot;I suppose I should also inform you
about what I&#39;ve been doing...&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; J&#39;onn looked curious.

&quot;Much like my human incarnation did with the Birds of
Prey I&#39;ve begun to organize a network of aides and
informants,&quot; Oracle explained. She smiled slightly,
&quot;I&#39;m hoping I can get some leads on our new
adversaries, too.&quot;

&quot;The Injustice League, yes.&quot; Kestel frowned. She
smiled slightly grimly, &quot;I&#39;ve prepared a short
briefing, for what it&#39;s worth.&quot;

&quot;Already?&quot; Supergirl blinked in surprise.

&quot;We have some eye witness reports,&quot; Kestrel answered
modestly, &quot;it wasn&#39;t that hard.&quot;

&quot;Give us what you have,&quot; Oracle agreed, &quot;I&#39;ll fill in
any blanks I can.&quot;


A image appeared, a redheaded woman in a gambling
outfit. &quot;Roulette appears to be the leader,&quot; Kestrel
said, &quot;and may have been responsible for the breakout
at the Fortress, too. Her primary ability is to alter
probabilities, much like her mother Hazard.&quot;

&quot;Rival,&quot; a man wearing a replica of the golden age
Flash&#39; costume, &quot;sorry to say I don&#39;t have a current
photo. A super speedster who challenged Jay Garrick he
was destroyed, absorbed into the speedforce. In modern
times he returned as a energy being, possessing
speedsters.&quot;

&quot;And we know Rival is in a female body,&quot; Oracle added.

&quot;Metallix,&quot; the silver metal woman&#39;s image appeared,
&quot;an old acquaintance of ours. The daughter of
Mentallo, apparently, and possessed of metal-shifting
abilities of her own. Also notoriously mentally
unstable, liable to turn on allies as well as her
enemies.&quot;

&quot;Thinking about how to use that?&quot; A-ko asked.

&quot;I always try to consider the tactical possibilities,&quot;
Kestel shrugged. A black clad blonde appeared on the
screen, &quot;Vox, a career criminal and assassin. She
possesses a powerful sonic attack, one that has a
broad range of effects on the human body.&quot;

Oracle waited a moment for more details then sighed
softly, &quot;What Kestrel isn&#39;t mentioning is that Vox is
Allison Queen, the biological daughter of Black Canary
and Green Arrow.&quot;

&quot;How the...,&quot; Flash blurted.

&quot;Dinah and Ollie had a liaison when she and Babs hit a
rough patch,&quot; Oracle said grimly, &quot;she put the baby up
for adoption without telling Babs originally.&quot;

&quot;That must have been a bombshell when Barbara found
out,&quot; Kyla murmured.

&quot;You have no idea,&quot; Kestrel said, &quot;I thought Babs was
going to kick Dinah out, she was that upset.&quot; She
paused, &quot;They tried their best to find Allison, but it
was years before she turned up.&quot;

&quot;Could we please move on?&quot; Oracle asked softly.

&quot;Scarecrow,&quot; Kestrel smiled wryly, &quot;Dr. Lisa Tyler.&quot;
The black haired woman in a white lab-coat looked
deceptively mild, somehow, as Kestrel explained, &quot;I&#39;ve
tangled with her a few times, she&#39;s perfected the fear
chemicals and methods the first Scarecrow used.&quot;

&quot;I understand that the new Catwoman is also after
her,&quot; J&#39;onn noted, &quot;we might be able to use her help,
too.&quot;

&quot;Last and possibly the most powerful,&quot; the black
haired sorceress dressed in black, almost Goth
clothing appeared as Kestrel explained, &quot;is the
Enchantress, once Zatanna. Possessed by a dark occult
force her sorcery has grow over time her only
limitations being visualization and her reliance on
spoken spells.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re a powerful group,&quot; Supergirl said then A-ko
smiled, &quot;but we&#39;re stronger and outnumber them.&quot;

&quot;Want to bet that doesn&#39;t last?&quot; B-ko sighed.</pre>
