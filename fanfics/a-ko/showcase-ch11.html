<a href="../a-ko/showcase-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Part 11: Themyscira

Hidden in the center of the Bermuda Triangle,
concealed by both godly magic and advanced science the
island was a sanctuary of green life and peace, even
with the current condition of the world around them.
Artificial islands floated off from the main landmass,
each one a wonder of technology as they served
functions of scientific research, medicine and
defense. In many ways, it actually lived up to the
nickname Paradise Island.

The current governor of the island smiled to herself
wryly, turning away from the gorgeous view outside of
the congress hall, the orange haired woman feeling
glad that the war scars that had once marked the
island were finally gone, in no small part due to the
woman whom they were all gathering here to discuss.

Phillipus smiled as the dusky skinned amazon watched
their leader walk over to the table they sat at,
&quot;Artemis, are you certain about this?&quot;

&quot;Mostly,&quot; Artemis agreed gravely, &quot;but that is why I
wanted to talk to you and the others about granting
the two of them full citizenship here.&quot;

The white haired young woman smiled wryly, her simple
robes concealing her scarred body. &quot;There&#39;ll be
trouble with Gotham city over this,&quot; Helena Kosmatos,
the heroine once known as Fury, said seriously, &quot;but I
think they&#39;ve earned a place here.&quot;

Mnemosyne the historian agreed, &quot;In truth I expected
them to be much more trouble for us, but except for
minor incidents they have settled well here.&quot;

&quot;Minor incidents,&quot; the warrior Euboea chuckled, her
black hair bouncing, &quot;I remembering you were more than
a bit upset when she turned your black hair green!&quot;

Mnemosyne blushed, &quot;Well, yes, but I certainly gave
her provocation.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;ve gotten to like the little fool,&quot; Phillipus
said fondly.

Artemis nodded, &quot;We all have grown to like them both.&quot;
She rose, smiling slightly, &quot;I think I&#39;ll ask the two
of them about this, too.&quot; Leaving the other Amazon&#39;s
farewells behind Artemis walked out of the room, down
the white marble steps and down the road, moving
through the roman styled architecture of the city and
out into the greenery that covered the island.

Not far from the city the city the little house was
situated in the middle of trees and brush, a quiet
sanctuary for the two women who chose to live there.
Walked up to the building she saw that it was empty
and smiled. There was the sound of voices and a
curious glance saw figures around the back so she
moved to approach them.

Pamela Isley smiled as she pushed her red hair back
from her face as she spoke to a figure who was
standing slightly apart, &quot;I don&#39;t think pursuing
Kestrel is a good idea, Dryad.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t help whom I love, mother,&quot; Dryad answered,
the plant woman bearing an almost eerie resemblance to
Pamela herself.

&quot;She&#39;s got a point, Red,&quot; the blonde haired woman
commented cheerfully, coming out of the house bearing
two glasses of clear fluid and one with a murky
substance. &quot;Here,&quot; Harleen Quinzel, nicknamed Harley
Quinn to friends, handed Dryad the dark fluid as she
explained, &quot;it&#39;s a mix of fertilizer and wine.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Dryad took it and drank it down, the
liquid seeming to low into the plants that helped make
up her seemingly human form.

&quot;I guess I just don&#39;t want to see you getting hurt,&quot;
Pamela sighed. She took her drink and smiled up at
Harley, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome, love,&quot; Harley took the seat beside
Pamela on the bench, one grown and shaped from the
plants all around the house.

&quot;At least Kestrel is less of a pain than her
predecessor was,&quot; Pamela smiled slightly, taking a
delicate sip from her drink.

Dryad paused, her pure white eyes narrowing slightly
as she seemed to tilt her head back to listen. &quot;You
have a guest,&quot; she told the two of them as she
smoothly turned to walk out of the little clearing,
&quot;I&#39;d better get going.&quot; She stilled, almost as if she
was concentrating, then her plant body seemed to
unravel, flowing into the forest until she was gone.

&quot;That was cool,&quot; Harley said cheerfully, &quot;I guess
being friends with the Swamp Thing has paid off for
her.&quot;

Artemis walked forward as she said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to
interrupt.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Pamela answered, her eyes just a bit
irritated, &quot;I hope that you don&#39;t object to Dryad
paying us a visit.&quot;

&quot;She is always welcome,&quot; Artemis answered her
seriously as she took a seat nearby, &quot;as are any women
who come here in peace.&quot;

Harley grinned at her impishly as she batted her eyes
cutely and asked, &quot;Forgiven me for the whoopee cushion
incident?&quot;

Artemis found herself smiling back almost unwillingly,
&quot;Yes, if only because of the looks I saw on my
ministers&#39; faces when it happened.&quot;

&quot;One of these days, love,&quot; Pamela gave Harley a fondly
scolding look, &quot;you&#39;re going to push things a bit too
far and get into real trouble.&quot; She focused her
attention on Artemis and said, &quot;I&#39;m still having some
problems with the reforesting of the north of the
island, Hera&#39;s strike nearly burned the surface down
to bedrock.&quot;

Artemis smiled slightly, &quot;Your efforts have been
remarkable, Pamela, but I&#39;m not here to discuss
business.&quot; She took a breath, &quot;A resolution has been
put before the island&#39;s congress to make you both
citizens of Themyscira.&quot;

Harley squealed happily as she impulsively hugged
Pamela, &quot;Did you hear that, Red! They like us, they
really like us!&quot;

Pamela gently disengaged from Harley as she gave
Artemis a shrewd look. &quot;Up till now the island has
been protected by the fiction that Harley and I were
captives, being rehabilitated here. If you give us
citizenship it could create problems,&quot; she said.

Harley looked a bit disappointed, protected in the
circle of Pamela&#39;s arms but she nodded her agreement.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to bring international trouble to the
island,&quot; she said, &quot;it might be better if we just
stayed captives.&quot;

Artemis looked at the two of them thoughtfully. &quot;Why
did you decide to come to Themyscira?&quot; she asked
gravely.

&quot;There&#39;s no extradition treaty with United States,&quot;
Harley said brightly.

Pamela gave her a look but reluctantly nodded. &quot;We
both wanted to make a fresh start,&quot; she said, &quot;and get
away from all the Gotham craziness.&quot; She smiled
slightly, &quot;When I read about the gods war and the
damage to the island&#39;s ecosystem, it seemed like
fate.&quot;

&quot;And it got us a long way away from Mr. J,&quot; Harley
added grimly.

Artemis nodded, a smile teasing the amazon&#39;s lips.
&quot;You&#39;ve always been upfront with us, it&#39;s something I
like,&quot; she said. She looked impish, &quot;And many of our
citizens were impressed when you helped fight off the
troops sent by the Scion of the Demon&#39;s Head.&quot;

&quot;We were just saving our own skins,&quot; Pamela answered
the governor firmly, a faint blush coloring her
cheeks.

&quot;And they landed one of their transports on Red&#39;s rose
garden,&quot; Harley said loyally, &quot;we couldn&#39;t let them
get away with that.&quot;

Artemis fought back a smile, wanting to keep a
straight face. &quot;You risked your lives to save amazons,
fighting to defend the island,&quot; she said firmly,
&quot;that&#39;s not something we forget.&quot; She rose, smiling,
&quot;When the resolution comes up for vote I will urge
that it be passed, and look forward to you being made
citizens of the island.&quot;

Pamela rose, keeping a arm around Harley as she said,
&quot;If I can&#39;t talk you out of the trouble it may cause
you, then we&#39;d be honored.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Harley beamed as Artemis smiled and
walked away.

&#39;I think we&#39;ll have to have our ambassador make a
formal statement,&#39; Artemis thought, &#39;as well as
contact Gotham city directly as a courtesy.&#39; A grim
little smile as she mused, &#39;I wonder how the city&#39;s
former guardian will take all this?&#39;

Pamela squeezed Harley gently, &quot;When you stopped the
Joker from killing me, did you ever expect us to end
up someplace like this?&quot;

Harley put her head on Pamela&#39;s shoulder, sighing
happily. &quot;I hoped we&#39;d be together Red,&quot; she answered,
&quot;that&#39;s good enough for me.&quot;

To be continued...

Authors Notes: Names of several amazons and other
details were taken from the DC Comics Encyclopedia, a
very good reference. The amazons abandoned a monarchy
recently in the Wonder Woman comics, so they now have
a democracy, if in a roman-style. The island really
was attacked by the goddess Hera in the comics, though
they didn&#39;t call on Poison Ivy to try and restore the place.</pre>
