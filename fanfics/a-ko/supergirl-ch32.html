<a href="../a-ko/supergirl-ch31.html">Back to Part 31</a><pre>&quot;Are you all right?&quot; B-ko asked as the tall, blue
haired woman took her lover aside. She had seen
Kestrel&#39;s face seem to shut down while talking with
Oracle and figured there just might be trouble coming.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Helena confessed, her black hair
slicked back, &quot;it appears my mother is aboard one of
the ships you rescued.&quot;

B-ko&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;The one who abandoned you? It
must have been a surprise.&quot;

Helena nodded, &quot;To be honest I don&#39;t know how I feel
about it right now.&quot;

Oracle walked into the room, the redheaded android
leading several alien representatives from the ships
that were now orbiting the moon. The Dominators were
eerie, thin yellow skinned figures with the trademark
red risks on their elongated heads. followed by the
troll like Khund warriors. One by one aliens trooped
in, but their eyes were drawn to a golden skinned
woman, her armored costume battered but her red eyes
narrowed with pride.

&quot;Blackfire,&quot; Supergirl murmured, A-ko&#39;s frown evident.

&quot;Who?&quot; Orin blinked, the redheaded young man giving
their leader a curious look.

&quot;Komand&#39;r, she&#39;s the Queen of Tamaran,&quot; Kyla said
quietly, &quot;and tangled with the Teen Titans several
times while trying to kill her sister, Starfire.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a winner,&quot; D-ko murmured, the robot girl
looking worried.

&quot;It gets worse,&quot; Katar Hol said coldly, the
reddish-haired Hawkwoman glaring towards Blackfire,
&quot;she murdered my mother during the Rann/Thangar war.&quot;

&quot;You aren&#39;t going to...?&quot; Orin asked her softly.

&quot;No, not now,&quot; Katar shook her head grimly, &quot;not here
at least.&quot;

&quot;Welcome to the Watchtower,&quot; Supergirl addressed the
group formally, &quot;my name is Supergirl and I lead the
Justice League. How can we help?&quot;

&quot;Repair our ssshipsss,&quot; the Dominator hissed out, &quot;we
musst flee thiss doomed world.&quot;

&quot;We were hoping you&#39;d consider offering help,&quot; Helena
said coldly, the cowl of her Kestrel uniform back in
place.

The Knund snorted his amusement, looking up at them.
&quot;Earth&#39;s warriors proved their valor when we attempted
to invade years ago,&quot; he said, &quot;but defeating Warworld
is beyond even you.&quot;

&quot;The Khund is right,&quot; Komand&#39;r gave him a disdainful
look, &quot;the Almeracians who lead Warworld now are far
more powerful than you can imagine.&quot;

J&#39;onn J&#39;onnz frowned, the tall green skinned Martian
studying her intently. &quot;As a precaution I did a low
level mind scan as you all entered the room,&quot; he
rumbled, &quot;you know more about Warworld than you&#39;re
saying.&quot;

Komand&#39;r gave J&#39;onn a glare, &quot;How dare you!&quot;

&quot;Considering your well known reputation for treachery,
it seemed to be only prudent,&quot; J&#39;onn replied calmly.

&quot;How dare you,&quot; Komand&#39;r raised her hands, energy
building around them... right before Kestrel slugged
her, sending the queen to the floor spitting blood.

&quot;Don&#39;t even think about it,&quot; Kestrel said coldly, &quot;or
I promise you that you&#39;ll regret it.&quot;

Komand&#39;r picked herself up with as much dignity as she
could. &quot;Who are you, Earther?&quot; she asked coldly.

Kestrel hesitated then drew her cowl back. &quot;Helena
Wayne,&quot; she answered simply, &quot;your grand-niece, I
believe.&quot;

Komand&#39;r gaped at her, for once completely surprised.

&quot;At least now we know for sure that it&#39;s Almerac
involved with this,&quot; Kyla Scott commented, enjoying
the respect that the Green Lantern uniform. It was
clear that at least some of the aliens would have
liked to throw their weight around, but their respect
for the office was stopping them.

ZZZWHIISH! In a burst of speed Flash arrived, a red
and gold streak. &quot;So,&quot; Iris West asked eagerly,
&quot;what&#39;d I miss?&quot;

&quot;Alien refugees and nearly a fist fight,&quot; Kyla
summarized. She gave Iris a curious look, &quot;So how did
the date go with Firestorm?&quot;

&quot;Pretty good,&quot; Iris blushed.

&quot;Oh ho!&quot; Kyla grinned over at her old friend impishly
and asked, &quot;So you spent the night together? How was
he?

Iris looked away, &quot;We did not sleep together, damn
it.&quot;

&quot;Somehow I doubt that,&quot; Kyla teased.

&quot;Besides, she&#39;s too much of a gentleman to sleep
together on the first date,&quot; Iris added with a fond
little smile.

&quot;She!&quot; Kyla blurted. She gave Iris a thoughtful look,
&quot;I thought that you didn&#39;t go that way!&quot;

A brighter blush colored Iris&#39; cheeks as she said,
&quot;It&#39;s a long story.&quot;

&quot;Does anyone know where Dr. Fate is?&quot; D-ko asked
curiously, &quot;I thought she&#39;d answer the emergency call
when we picked up the ships.&quot;

There was a shimmer in the air, almost as if the
fabric of space itself were being folded and in a
swirl of golden cloth Dr. Fate appeared, her blue and
gold uniform gleaming. She wore a simple, ankh
inscribed circlet on her brow and beads of gold were
braided with longer strands of her white hair. &quot;My
apologies,&quot; she said seriously, &quot;Black Adam and Lady
Marvel were fighting again and I and several others
had to step in.&quot;

&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Supergirl admitted. She hesitated, &quot;I
don&#39;t suppose you could just magic the damaged vessels
back together...?&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Fate shook her head, &quot;my powers are more
combat oriented.&quot;

Komand&#39;r was studying Helena thoughtfully, a hand
pressed to the corner of her mouth to stop the flow of
blood. &quot;You do carry a resemblance to your mother,&quot;
she conceded softly.

&quot;J&#39;onn was asking about Warworld,&quot; Helena asked as she
ignored that comment.

Komand&#39;r nodded slightly as she said, &quot;The Almeracians
have transformed themselves in a disgusting manner.
Their men are dead and they now procreate via
technology.&quot;

&quot;All of them?&quot; Supergirl&#39;s eyes narrowed, thinking of
the ship full of women that had tried to retrieve C-ko
in the past.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Komand&#39;r said grimly, &quot;and they have enhanced
their elite with genetic material taken from the races
they have defeated.&quot; A pause, &quot;You can&#39;t imagine how
powerful they are, now.&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound good,&quot; Katar said bleakly.

&quot;Indeed, Hawkgirl,&quot; Komand&#39;r answered, voice dripping
with sarcasm.

&quot;Who is in their elite?&quot; Oracle stepped in before
Katar did something violent. &quot;I&#39;d love to put a name
to our enemy.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re still led by the queen of Almerac, Maxima,&quot;
Komand&#39;r said as a faint smile tugged at her lips,
&quot;and her beloved daughter, the princess Cylene.&quot;

B-ko stopped what she was doing on hearing that name,
a sudden chill landing in her gut. Supergirl seemed to
have a similar reaction, A-ko exchanging a gaze with
B-ko. &quot;Do you have a image of this Cylene?&quot; Oracle
asked, wondering at the two women&#39;s reaction.

&quot;Yesss,&quot; a Dominator hissed, activating a small
holographic unit. The blue eyed blonde who appeared
was beautiful, her face open and sunny as she smiled.
She was well shaped, full breasts and hips beneath her
simple jumpsuit and a cloak swirled around her.

Almost as soon as Cylene&#39;s image appeared A-ko and
B-ko gasped, both women looking like they&#39;d been
punched in the gut. &quot;What?&quot; Helena demanded.

&quot;I think,&quot; A-ko said in a voice numb with surprise,
&quot;that may be C-ko.&quot;</pre>
