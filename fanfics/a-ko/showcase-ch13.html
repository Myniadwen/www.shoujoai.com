<h1>DC Universe 2045: Showcase (part 13 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../a-ko/index.html">Project A-ko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../a-ko/showcase-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Captain Cold scowled as the young man ran, cursing
softly under his breath. Buying the costume and freeze
gun off ebay had seemed like such a good idea just a
few months ago, but now it looked like it was going to
bit him on the ass. The job here in Bludhaven had
looked simple enough, too, using the gun to hold up a
bank then get the hell out of town.

&quot;How the hell can one superhero be that good?&quot; Cold
muttered.

Almost as soon as Captain Cold had arrived he had been
confrontred by the red and black garbed figure,
silvery mask gleaming in the darkness of the alley. &quot;I
know who you are,&quot; the staff was pointed at him, &quot;and
I strongly advise you keep you costume packed away,
Cold.&quot;

&quot;I have&#39;t been convicted of a crime bounty hunter,&quot; he
had shot back, shaken to have been found so easily,
&quot;I&#39;m not your business.&quot;

&quot;Maybe not,&quot; Manhunter replied with a emotionless
voice, &quot;but I think you will be.&quot; Turning away the
taller figure added, &quot;Stay out of trouble.&quot;

Retreating to his hotel room he debated carrying
through the job, but he really needed the money.
Finally he convinced himself that Manhunter couldn&#39;t
be everywhere, couldn&#39;t catch him once he was ready to
go. Sneaking into the bank after dark, disabling the
security sustems had been cake, only the iron door of
the vault slowing him down.

That was where the ice gun came in. A small, absurdly
simple looking weapon it projected streams of
incredible cold, turning thick steel to a brittle,
weak barrier in seconds. Shattering the metal he
loaded up the satchel then bolted into the night,
carrying enough jewels and prescious metals to support
himself for many years.

&quot;Captain Cold,&quot; the voice boomed out from the darkness
and he jumped, gazing up in shock at the figure who
waited on a nearby rooftop. The staff shone silver
like the mask he wore, the armored uniform blood red
in the street lights as he leapt down to street level.
Calmly he declared, &quot;No man escapes the Manhunter.&quot;

&quot;Shit,&quot; Cold fired off the freeze gun as he bolted but
the Manhunter seemed to disappear. Down the alleys he
raced but each turn seemed to bring him upon the red
clad figure, the same grim phrase repeated again and
again.

&quot;No man escapes the Manhunter.&quot;

&#39;Oh yeah,&#39; Cold thought to himself irritably, &#39;right.&#39;
Still he tried to get away, to get back to his hotel,
grab his stuff and bolt. Finally convinced he lost the
Manhunter he headed inside the hotel and upstairs,
running into his room. &#39;Got to get my bags,&quot; he
muttered, &quot;if I can just get out of town before he
catches up with me...&quot;

Zzzap!

The taser built into the staff struck faster than Cold
could have expected, quickly dropping the young man in
a crumpled heap at the Manhunter&#39;s booted feet. &quot;They
never learn,&quot; he muttered to himself, kneeling down to
hoist the gfigure over his shoulder with a grunt,
&quot;better contact the bank for the standard recovery
fee.&quot;

The loot was returned to the bank, Captain Cold
dropped off with the police department. Manhunter
collected a motorcycle from where it waited and was
off, racing into the night. The evening&#39;s patrol was
accomplished quickly and efficiently, then the
adventurer retreated to a tunnel connecting to the
city&#39;s sewers.

Beneath a older apartment building in the bad part of
town Manhunter parked the bike in a concealed
subbasement, then rode a hidden elevator up to the top
floor. Emerging in a older looking workout room
Manhunter stripped off the armored costume, hanging it
up on a older manikin.

The younger woman smiled as the blonde touched the
silver mask, the simple features based off a humanoid
model that might be hundreds of thousands of years
old. &#39;Annd worn by both heroes and villains over the
years,&#39; she reminded herself.

&quot;People would be so shocked to see officer Angela
O&#39;Dare is also the bounty hunter Manhunter,&quot; the
amused voice said.

The blonde whirled, glaring at the other woman. &quot;Don&#39;t
surprise me like that mom,&quot; Angela said as she
sheepishly put down her battle staff, &quot;one of these
days I&#39;m going to accidentally taser you or
something.&quot;

Hope O&#39;Dare smiled, her orange hair now nearly while.
&quot;You&#39;re too good at the hero biz for that,&quot; she said
as she walked forward to her daughter&#39;s side. Hope
looked at her curiously, &quot;So who was it tonight?&quot;

Angela chuckled as they went out of the room into the
converted apartment, careful to lock the door behind
her. &quot;Some mook who bought Captain Cold&#39;s old gear,&quot;
she said casually.

Hope actually laughed, &quot;And how many unsuccessful
villains have tried that? Someone should put a warning
label on that stuff.&quot;

&quot;The original Captain Cold must have had some talent,&quot;
Angela acknowledged, &quot;no one else has been able to
pull off the identity.&quot; She sat on her couch with a
tired sigh, tilting her head back to rest on a
cushion.

&quot;Do you want me to make you something?&quot; Hope offered
quietly.

Angela looked up at her mother, her expression
thoughtful. &quot;You know that I really like having you
here,&quot; she said to her gently, &quot;but I think this has
been the longest I&#39;ve seen you away from Opal city in
years. What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Hope hesitated, standing there in the kitchen. &quot;The
Shade and I,&quot; she finally said quietly, &quot;we&#39;ve broken
up.&quot;

&quot;What!&quot; Angela blurted in surprise.

Hope O&#39;Dare had met the Shade in Opal, back when Jack
Knight had first taken up the identity of Starman. The
Shade, a former villain who loved Opal city began to
gradually become a hero for the sake of the city, and
even became a trusted ally and friend. Even more a
unique chemistry developed between him and Hope, one
that ultimately led to them becoming involved.

Angela shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t believe it, Dad loves
you.&quot;

&quot;He does,&quot; Hope acknowledged with a sigh, &quot;but I don&#39;t
think that&#39;s the problem.&quot;

There were a few tears in Angela&#39;s eyes as she asked,
&quot;Then what is?&quot;

Hope returned to the couch, sittig down and hugging
Angela gently. &quot;He isn&#39;t aging, Angela,&quot; she said,
&quot;and he knows he&#39;ll outlive me. More importantly he
knows how complicated it&#39;s becoming for me to explain
why he seems so much younger than I.&quot;

Angela winced, remembering a few comments she had
overheard when she was younger. &quot;He was the one who
left?&quot; she asked.

Hope nodded glumly. &quot;He felt that one of us had to
make the break,&quot; she said, &quot;and that it might as well
be him.&quot; A ghost of a smile touched her lips as she
added, &quot;As a former villain he thought it&#39;d be
fitting, too.&quot;

&quot;Do you want me to come with you back to Opal?&quot; Angela
asked. She put her hand on her mother&#39;s, &quot;I can track
him down, try to talk some sense into him.&quot;

&quot;I appreciate the thought,&quot; Hope said to her daughter
gently, &quot;but Shade&#39;s mind is made up.&quot;

&quot;Not very fair to you, though,&quot; Angela said.

&quot;Life isn&#39;t always fair,&quot; Hope shrugged, &quot;I found that
out when my brothers died.&quot; She shook herself, getting
up from the couch, &quot;But enough about that, how are
things with you?&quot;

&quot;Work is good,&quot; Angela quite willingly went along with
the change of subject, &quot;the captain is happy with my
stats.&quot; A little grin, &quot;And anyone that I can&#39;t get as
a police officer I can always track down as the
Manhunter.&quot;

Hope went into the kitchenn, getting out the supplies
for sandwiches. &quot;You always concentrate on work,&quot; she
chided, &quot;what about romance?&quot;

&quot;Here we go again,&quot; Angela rolled her eyes.

&quot;You cannot tell me that there&#39;s no one you&#39;re
interested in,&quot; Hope noted, laying out the bread then
setting slices of meat on them. &quot;I remember all the
trouble you got into at school.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I was young,&quot; Angela protested.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t that long ago,&quot; Hope noted, slicing the
completed sandwiches in half. Setting them on a plate
she carried it over, &quot;Come on, spill! I want names of
boy or girlfriends, please.&quot;

&quot;And what makes you think I&#39;d have a girlfriend?&quot;
Angela looked at her mom in surprise.

&quot;According to the gossip rags most of the Justice
League does,&quot; Hope shrugged, &quot;I figured it was just
the latest thing for superheroines.&quot;

Angela just groaned.</pre>
