<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 24 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../a-ko/index.html">Project A-ko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../a-ko/supergirl-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>Supergirl descended towards the sea smoothly, her red
cape swirling behind her as she hit the water.
Re-entry from space had heated her body so much that
the water boiled a moment, eventually subsiding as she
plunged into the depths. A simple breathing unit was
slipped over the redhead&#39;s mouth, other than that she
needed no special gear beneath the waves.

The deep blue shifted as A-ko descended, going to deep
blue then finally a nearly lightless darkness. Here
far below the surface, concealed by both science and
enchantment was the continent of Atlantis, lost
beneath the waves. The city that she was searching for
soon appeared, artificial and organic sources of light
providing illumination for the numerous residents.

The black haired man waiting outside with the guards
carried his age well, the uniform he wore swirling in
red and black. &quot;Welcome,&quot; the former Titan called
Tempest gave her a cautious smile, &quot;the king is
waiting to see you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; A-ko nodded, red hair swirling around her
face.

They moved through the glowing streets, residents
peeking out nervously as they swam by. Tempest smiled
slightly, &quot;So how are the Titans doing?&quot;

&quot;A fourth incarnation has started,&quot; Supergirl answered
him, &quot;with several younger heroes being mentored by
members of the older generation.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Tempest answered her simply.

The palace itself stood largely unguarded, though A-ko
wasn&#39;t surprised. The reputation the king of Atlantis
had was such that few would dare to directly oppose
him, even now that he had officially retired from
being a superhero. The halls glittered, not with
treasure but instead by coral and native rock,
creating a serene yet lovely atmosphere.

Arthur Curry sat on the throne, his blonde hair and
beared now streaked with grey. A simple circlet rested
on his brow, the formal garb of an Atlantian king
resting uncomfortably on his muscular body. His
expression was grave but lightened as he smiled and
said, &quot;A-ko, it&#39;s been a long time.&quot;

&quot;That it has, sir,&quot; A-ko agreed, thinking back fondly
to when the man before standing before her had brought
his children to meet the other descendants of the JLA.

&quot;It&#39;s nice to see you,&quot; Dolphin agreed, the white
haired but youthful queen slipping back into her seat
beside Arthur&#39;s smoothly. She looked much less formal,
her clothes loose and clearly chosen for comfort.

&quot;So,&quot; Arthur looked at her shrewdly, &quot;is this visit
business or pleasure?&quot;

&quot;A bit of both,&quot; Supergirl admitted. &quot;This has been
the first time I could visit since I took over the
family business,&quot; she tugged at the &#39;S&#39; shield shirt
she wore, &quot;and there is the question of where an
Atlantian mech that attacked the surface came
from....&quot;

&quot;The mech,&quot; a scowling Tempest spoke up, &quot;was stolen
by the criminal Black Manta then sold off to the
highest bidder.&quot;

&quot;We recently extended him an amnesty in the hopes that
he had truly reformed,&quot; Dolphin explained to her
apologetically, &quot;but despite his regaining his sanity
the Manta continues to be a dangerous criminal.&quot;

&quot;Has the Fortress break-out been a problem here?&quot; A-ko
asked curiously.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Arthur smiled grimly, &quot;there are few
villains native to the sea, and even less willing to
risk my wrath.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Supergirl answered. She took a slightly
nervous breath, &quot;During the Fortress breakout the
Justice League was spread very thin, something that
has led us to consider holding a membership drive....&quot;

Tempest shook his head, &quot;Personally, I&#39;d be interested
in joining the League but I&#39;m tied up with duties here
in Atlantis.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;m a bit too old to be playing this game,&quot;
Arthur looked thoughtful as he continued, &quot;but there
is someone who might be interested.&quot;

A messenger was sent and a few minutes later a young
mann arrives, dressed in a simple uniform of white and
blue. His red hair fell into his blue eyes, and his
face was almost unearthly handsome. &quot;My lord,&quot; he
bowed to Arthur, eyes widening slightly as he saw
Supergirl.

&quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Orin,&quot; Arthur nodded towards
him, &quot;a member of our Atlantian guards who recently
petitioned to go to the surface world.&quot;

Orin nodded to Supergirl, &quot;Ma&#39;am.&quot; Looking to Arthur
he asked eagerly, &quot;Does this mean my petition has been
granted?&quot;

&quot;Easy,&quot; Dolphin smiled at the young man and he
flushed.

&quot;Like most Atlantians he will possess enhanced
strength on the surface, and he&#39;s been treated so that
he can safwely function on the surface for extended
periods. He also,&quot; Arthur smiled, &quot;has gained certain
abilities in the manipulation of water.&quot;

Supergirl studied Orin a moment, then nodded firmly.
&quot;If Aquaman recomends you I&#39;d have to be a fool to
turn you down,&quot; she said, &quot;if you&#39;d be interested in
joining the Justice League?&quot;

Orin grinned as he took her offered hand, &quot;I&#39;d be
honored.&quot;

Across the globe in Gotham City a blaze of green lit
the sky, then flashed on towards a silvery tower
rising towards the heavens. Kyla Scott, Earth&#39;s
current Green Lantern, descended to the ground on the
emerald energies of her power ring and gazed up at the
building thoughtfully.

The headquarters and museum of the Justice Society of
America had been almost a second home for her, back
when she had been growing up. The second and third
generation members had watched over her, even as she
had eagerly consumed the history of those great
heroes.

A red and gold dressed streak appeared at her side,
blurring slightly as she rapidly moved back and forth,
&quot;WherehaveyoubeenIthoughtI&#39;dbewaitingouthereforever....&quot;

&quot;Slow down,&quot; Kyla chuckled softly.

Flash did so a bit sheepishly, obviously unaware that
she had still been operating a super speed. &quot;Sorry,&quot;
she said, &quot;but what took you so long?&quot;

Kyla just ignored that, opening up the front door as
she led her friend inside. &quot;Iris, chill,&quot; she scolded
as they moved through the displays of golden and
silver aged heroes.

Iris West just grinned impishly beneath her red cowl.
&quot;So do you think she&#39;ll be here?&quot; she asked as Kyla
used her keycard to open up the private section of the
building.

&quot;That&#39;s what the message said,&quot; Kyla said, leading the
way into the conference room.

At first glance the woman standing there by the table
looked quite young, her short white hair framing her
beautiful face. But on a closer examination it was an
odd sort of youth, really an kind of agelessness
coupled with great power. She wore a simple, ankh
inscribed gold circlet on her brow, and beads of gold
were braided with longer strands of her hair. The blue
and cold uniform was distinctive, the cape and amulet
glowing in the dim light.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Iris murmured.

Dr. Fate turned to them as they entered, her eyes
piercing as she studied them. Finally she murmured,
&quot;Having Alan Scott find me was very clever.&quot;

Kyla hid a smile at that. Her grandfather had been the
golden age Green Lantern, possessed of a mystical
power ring wielding the flames of the Starheart. Those
flames had slowly become part of the hero, eventually
replacing flesh and blood and making him nearly
immortal. He had ultimately become one of the mystical
guardians of the world, though he still kept an eye on
his family.

Flash was the first to break the moment of silence,
&quot;As you probably know we&#39;re members of the Justice
League, and we were sent to.....&quot;

&quot;The League lacks a mystical member,&quot; Fate cut her off
crisply, &quot;and you were hoping that I would consent to
join.&quot;

&quot;Dr. Fate, by the tone of your voice you don&#39;t sound
very interested,&quot; Kyla noted, &quot;or would you prefer if
I called you Lyta Hall?&quot;

Fate relented just a bit, a slight smile on her face,
&quot;No, I&#39;m merely annoyed that I have little choice but
to join.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Flash blinked.

Fate walked over to them, golden cape flowing as she
remarked, &quot;Long story.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re willing to join?&#39; Kyla wanted confirmation.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Fate nodded, her circlet glowing in the light,
&quot;and I have a little puzzle to pass on to the League,
one I hope you&#39;ll have better luck understanding than
I did.&quot;

To be continued....

Author&#39;s Note: The mecha comment in the Atlantis
section ties in to Outsiders 2045 by Chris Davies. Dr.
Fate previously appeared in a chapter of DC Universe
2045: Showcase Part 3: The Books of Magic, and I went
into her background in those Authors Notes.</pre>
