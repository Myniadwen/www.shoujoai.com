<a href="../a-ko/supergirl-ch25.html">Back to Part 25</a><pre>&quot;I still think that Injustice League is a stupid
name,&quot; Metallix complained, the silver metal woman
watching covertly as they waited.

Scarecrow watched with academic interest as the battle
went on, her fingers gently toying with one of her
vials of fear-chemical. The black haired woman smiled,
her labcoat swirling around her as she commented,
&quot;It&#39;s not like there are many alternatives.&quot;

&quot;Villainy Incorporated?&quot; Vox offered, the tall blonde
walking away from where she had been fighting a group
of federal agents. The ambush would probably have
worked against a normal criminal, but her sonic gifts
had made short work of the officers. Dressed in her
simple red and black bodysuit Vox cut a fine if deadly
looking figure.

Roulette shook her head, her red hair flowing around
her. &quot;Last time I checked Lex Luthor had been
organizing his allies under that name,&quot; she said,
adjusting her gambler&#39;s clothes, &quot;and I wouldn&#39;t want
to annoy him into coming out of retirement.&quot;

&quot;I thought he was dead?&quot; Metallix looked startled.

&quot;No one&#39;s found the body,&quot; Vox replied dryly.

&quot;And with someone like Luthor,&quot; the young lady said,
her golden cowl covering her face, &quot;you&#39;d better be
sure.&quot;

&quot;True enough, Rival,&quot; Scarecrow admitted, studying her
thoughtfully.

Rival was one of their newest arrivals, a
super-speedster with a deadly hatred for the Flashes.
Originally Rival fought the 1940&#39;s Flash, but was
reborn in the modern era by possessing others with the
powers of speed. First the obscure hero Max Mercury
fell, then others. Now Rival inhabited the body of
Jesse Chambers, once called Jesse Quick, and had
reshaped her form to it&#39;s own needs. Blonde hair went
black, aged flesh restored to youthful vitality and
the body&#39;s original spirit was exiled to the
mysterious energy called Speed Force.

&quot;Did you deal with that upstart, Zoom?&quot; Roulette asked
her curiously.

&quot;Young Mister West,&quot; Rival smiled with cold amusement.
&quot;The fact he was named for Jay Garrick made killing
him all the sweeter.&quot;

Vox shrugged casually. &quot;Any luck finding out where the
hell Enchantress went to?&quot; she asked her companions as
they advanced on the government building.

&quot;She&#39;ll be here when we need her,&quot; Roulette said
firmly, silently adding, &#39;I hope.&#39;

The voice echoed in her mind, &#39;You have done well so
far, little one.&#39;

&#39;About time you contacted me again,&#39; Roulette answered
with amusement.

&#39;I&#39;ve been a little busy,&#39; there was a gentle mocking
in the tone.

&#39;Of course,&#39; Roulette answered dryly. &#39;You know, it
would be nice to have a name to call you,&#39; she added,
&#39;if only to convince me that I&#39;m not talking to
myself.&#39;

There was a moment of silence. &#39;You may call me...
Cylene,&#39; she finally said.

&#39;So why are you contacting me now?&#39; Roulette asked.

&#39;A-ko and her allies are expanding the League,&#39; Cylene
explained seriously, Roulette seeing the mental image
of a delicate blonde &#39;you may need to look into
expanding your own ranks to match.&#39;

&#39;Thank you,&#39; Roulette answered.

&#39;You&#39;re welcome,&#39; and with that Cylene&#39;s voice and
presence faded away.

&quot;You have the oddest look on your face,&quot; Metallix said
as Roulette became aware of the world around her.

&quot;Our sponsor contacted me,&quot; Roulette ran a hand
through her hair, &quot;it seems that the Justice League
has been busy recruiting.&quot;

&quot;Then I guess we&#39;ll just have to step up our own
efforts,&quot; Scarecrow said casually as she tapped a
device to activate the fear-bombs that had been
planted in the building earlier. In seconds screams
and fear filled cries rang out, then the front doors
burst open and people streamed outside, running right
by the group of women.

&quot;What did you do to them?&quot; Vox raised an eyebrow,
looking without pity at the pale, tear streaked faces
of the men and women.

&quot;Claustrophobia,&quot; Scarecrow explained simply, &quot;along
with the fear that their air might be running out if
they stayed indoors.&quot;

&quot;Nasty,&quot; Metallix calmly ripped the front doors off
and lead the others inside the building. All her
teammates slipped air filters on, but the living metal
woman had little fear of poisonous gasses.

&quot;So why are we hitting a little FBI office out in
Nebraska, anyway?&quot; Rival asked coldly.

&quot;All the FBI offices are on the same secure network,&quot;
Vox informed her, &quot;so we can use this office to hack
into the others for criminal datafiles we might need.&quot;
She smiled coldly, &quot;Not to mention implanting a virus
into the federal systems.&quot;

Rival nodded slightly, her eyes crinkling in
amusement. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m going to enjoy seeing what all of
this does,&quot; she answered.

&quot;Do you have any suggestions for new recruits?&quot;
Scarecrow asked as they went upstairs, found a
computer terminal and let Metallix get to work. It was
eerie to see, the way that her hands distended,
flowing into the computer as she interfaced directly
with the systems.

&quot;Nyssa, the daughter of the Demon&#39;s Head,&quot; Roulette
answered crisply, &quot;she&#39;s a power in her own right, as
well as holding part of her fathers empire.&quot;

&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Metallix agreed. She cocked her head to
the side, &quot;Have you considered the new Prometheus?&quot;

&quot;Too unpredictable,&quot; Vox spoke up from where she was
keeping an eye out at the window, &quot;not to mention the
rumors that she plays both sides of the law.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t know that,&quot; Rival noted. She smiled coldly,
&quot;There is another being who might be useful, the
Silver Banshee.&quot;

&quot;To use against Supergirl,&quot; Roulette nodded
thoughtfully, &quot;we&#39;ll have to look into it.&quot; she looked
to Metallix, who was smirking, &quot;How&#39;s it going?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve downloaded the DEO, FBI and police files on
active superbeings,&quot; Metallix informed them as she
pulled free, &quot;and the virus has been unleashed.&quot;

&quot;That was fast,&quot; Scarecrow said crisply. Her eyes
glittered with an odd kind of intensity as she asked,
&quot;Do they list the subject&#39;s... fears?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll download what they&#39;ve got onto a disk for you,&quot;
Metallix paused as alarms rang out again, &quot;later.
Shall we see what&#39;s going on?&quot;

Roulette smiling grimly, &quot;Vox, care to make us a
shortcut?&quot;

Vox put her hand on the wall, nodding slightly. &quot;Cover
your ears,&quot; she commanded and began to scream. It
started as a low sound, vibrating the bones then
swiftly rose to a wail that staggered the women around
her. The wall she directed that sound at crumbled in
seconds, the outer wall beyond that only holding up a
few seconds longer.

Rival raced out first, the female superspeedster
dropping men and women in the police detachment faster
than the eye could possibly see. In a moment nearly
eight of the officers were down, blood splattering
them from the viscous blows she had struck.

&quot;Aw, she didn&#39;t leave anything for us,&quot; Metallix
complained as she lead the way out.

&quot;I&#39;ll remind her to save us a few next time,&quot; Roulette
said dryly, shaking her head.

Once the group reached the impatiently waiting Rival
Vox curiously asked her, &quot;Did you have to kill any of
them?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re small change,&quot; Rival wiped her red gloves off
smoothly, &quot;no need.&quot; A smile, &quot;Now if they were Flash
or Impulse...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get distracted too much by your personal
agenda,&quot; Scarecrow reminded her.

There was a feeling of electricity in the air, almost
a breathless anticipation, then with a crack of
thunder the air split. Enchantress floated down from
where she had appeared, her black cloak flowing over
the white business suit she now wore. &quot;I&#39;m ready to
take you to the base,&quot; the black haired sorceress
said, the madness in her eyes showing little sign of
the heroine known as Zatanna.

&quot;Then let&#39;s go,&quot; Roulette said wryly.</pre>
