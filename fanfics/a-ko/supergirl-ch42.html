<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 42 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../a-ko/index.html">Project A-ko</a>

<a href="../a-ko/supergirl-ch41.html">Back to Part 41</a><pre>Warworld flowed through space silently, the airless void carrying no 
sound from the massive alien construct. The metal armor gleamed in the 
sunlight, the raised turrets and other weapons swiveling dangerously 
seeking any foe. Of course, they relied on the senses of the life forms 
commanding them, and were as vulnerable to error as any such devices.

They didn&#39;t see the white haired woman streaking in faster than any foe 
they had yet faced, nor were they prepared for her weapons. A neutron 
grenade exploded a gap in the outer armor, sending stunned slaves and 
warriors cartwheeling into space, the woman diving through the gap as 
she opened fire with alien rifles.

&quot;Surrender, woman,&quot; the orange haired leader of the security patrol 
demanded, glad that the emergency seals were restoring atmosphere to the 
section.

&quot;Never!&quot; the stranger cried as she opened up again with her strange 
weapons, &quot;Come and see how a Kryptonian wages war!&quot;

On the command bridge Maxima scowled, her red hair flowing around her 
face. &quot;Who is this fool?&quot; she demanded.

&quot;We gathered some data from the Dark Circle crime group,&quot; a leutenant 
spoke up respectfully, &quot;she appears to match a being they had 
difficulties with. They called her Superwoman, though they thought she 
was a Daxamite.&quot;

&quot;Understandably,&quot; Maxima conceded. Daxamites were rare in space due to 
their isolationist natures, but a real Kryptonian was even rarer. She 
frowned in thought a moment then said, &quot;We&#39;ll need to deploy the 
Kryptonite arms.&quot;

&quot;I thought we were saving those for when we face Supergirl?&quot; another 
minion asked, her hair raven black. Shasti smiled grimly as she pointed 
out, &quot;We only have a limited amount of the mineral available.&quot;

&quot;Our only other option is to overwhelm her in pure numbers,&quot; Maxima 
noted with a frown, &quot;and that could cost us greatly.&quot;

Deidre turned to the feed from the cameras in the sector under attack, 
her eyes widening a little in awe. &quot;That may not be needed, ma&#39;am,&quot; she 
reported with a smile, &quot;I think Princess Cybele has arrived.&quot;

The blonde strode into the ruined wing of Warworld, her blue eyes 
widening slightly. There were dead bodies scattered around, some of them 
elite Almeracan warriors. Cybele hadn&#39;t believed it was possible for 
someone to kill them any more, and it shocked her deeply.

&quot;Yield,&quot; the white haired woman raised one of her guns as she added 
coldly, &quot;I need a guide to this madhouse.&quot;

&quot;Never,&quot; Cybele answered as she looked into her eyes, &quot;but I give you 
the same option. Surrender and I might let you live.&quot;

&quot;Not a chance,&quot; the white haired woman growled as she opened fire.

Cybele dodged as the woman shifted her aim, very nearly tagging her. She 
was incredibly fast but Cybele was the best of the best, enhanced with 
the best seized DNA. Even better she contained the genetic potential of 
her two lovers A-ko and B-ko, both of which were even more incredible.

Reaching out with her mind Cybele lightly touched the other&#39;s mind, 
covertly getting a sense of her. The other woman was Karsta Wor-Ul, a 
deserter from the Kryptonian army who had wandered the galaxy. She had 
survived so long using alien technology to rejuvenate herself, 
ultimately hiding on Earth for a time. Finally she chose to face justice 
for criminal acts she had committed, probably inspired by Kal-El.

&quot;Karsta,&quot; as she ducked behind a piece of mostly intact armor plate 
Cybele called, &quot;you don&#39;t want to do this!&quot;

&quot;How do you know my name?&quot; Karsta shouted back suspisciously.

Deciding it might be best to hide her telepathy Cylene lied, &quot;We have 
complete records, Karsta.&quot; Keeping her voice calm and even she added, 
&quot;All about how you were abandoned by your homeworld, travelled across 
this part of the galaxy an fought as a true warrior.&quot;

Karsta fired off a few wild shots to keep Cybele&#39;s head down as she 
answered, &quot;Then you should also know I&#39;ve been a planetary protector as 
a punishment.&quot;

&quot;A act unworthy of you,&quot; Cybele shot back, finding it surprisingly 
difficult to probe deeper with her power. Beneath her recent memories it 
was like hitting a neutronium wall, utterly impregnable.

&quot;That&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong,&quot; Karsta answered firmly.

Cylene grit her teeth, cursing the almost poisonous influence of the 
humans. &quot;You won&#39;t follow the wise course and follow us?&quot; Cylene had to 
ask.

&quot;As you said,&quot; Karsta answered firmly, &quot;never.&quot;

&quot;So be it,&quot; Cylene said as she raced from cover, unleashing her true 
speed. Faster than even Karsta&#39;s eyes could track she disarmed the older 
woman, a rapid strike sending the alien weapons flying.

Like a true warrior Karsta recovered, of course, her roundhouse punch 
grazing Cylene as she swiftly dodged. They swung again, both ready for 
battle and their firsts hammered together, the inhuman forces pulsing 
outward. The shock wave buckled floor and armor, the massive support 
pillars of Warword trembling in sympathy.

Up on the bridge the young women grabbed at their terminals as the very 
deck shook, the inertial dampers in the vessel strained to their limits. 
Sections of roof fell as sparks burst from some of the stations, 
electronics overloading from the sudden shock.

&quot;Damage report!&quot; Maxima called fiercely, the tall redhead bracing a hand 
against the back of her command chair.

&quot;Unknown degree of damage to the outer hull,&quot; a pretty minion answered, 
her silver hair flowing down over her eyes, &quot;power systems are down 
around there as well as a unknown degree of damage to secondary systems. 
We&#39;re attempting to re-route around the damaged areas, but it will take 
time.&quot;

Maxima sat down in her chair, grimacing as she noticed the shock had 
knocked the chair slightly off. &quot;Is Cylene all right?&quot; she asked 
worriedly.

&quot;She appears fine,&quot; the silver haired woman said, &quot;from the data we can 
gather from sensors in nearby sectors. In fact, from what I can tell 
she&#39;s enjoying herself.&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Maxima shook her head, wondering if her telepathic training of 
the girl as a warrior might have gone a bit too far.

&quot;Is Earth taking advantage?&quot; Shasti asked, her eyes narrowing 
thoughtfully.

&quot;Long range sensors say no,&quot; Deidre amswered simply, &quot;but I&#39;d suggest 
sending scouts out to confirm that.&quot;

&quot;Do so,&quot; Maxima nodded her agreement. &quot;Put the battle between Cylene and 
the Kryptonian on my screen,&quot; she said as she activated a viewer beside 
her throne, &quot;I look forward to her victory.&quot;

Cylene panted softly, blood running down into her face from a cut above 
her eye, her red blood vivid on her light skin. &quot;You&#39;re very good,&quot; she 
noted, watching her foe warily.

Karsta winced as she stood up, a rib shifting from where the girl kicked 
her in the side. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she answered, her fists clenched as she 
assessed her enemy. Frankly, the situation wasn&#39;t looking good. This 
Cylene was at least marginally more powerful than her, as well as being 
younger and a bit more fit. To balance that Karsta had years more 
experience and more willingness to fight dirty, but that didn&#39;t quite 
even out. The girl was going to win, if the fight drew on long enough.

Cylene reached up to rum the blood away from her face, wincing in pain. 
&quot;One more chance,&quot; she said, &quot;join us. I don&#39;t want to kill such a 
capable warrior.&quot; Not only was Karsta tough, she had deliberately 
destroyed the Daxamite killing weapons she had brought, denying them to 
Warworld&#39;s forces to study.

Karsta looked her in the eye, then... hesitated. She didn&#39;t want to die, 
not here all alone, cut off from friends and allies. Instead of rushing 
to attack she walked towards Cylene as she sighed, &quot;Maybe you&#39;re right.&quot;

Cylene tried to read the woman&#39;s mind but all she got was a exhausted 
muddle, Karsta appeared literally too tired to think straight. Their 
battle had stretched over a hour, and even she was exhausted. She could 
barely imagine how this older woman was coping.

&quot;What do you want to do with me?&quot; Karsta asked, her shoulders drooping a 
bit as she stood in front of the girl.

Cylene reached out to cup Karsta&#39;s chin, tilting her eyes up to meet 
her&#39;s. &quot;Not much,&quot; she replied honestly, &quot;just a genetic sample and a 
promise of loyalty. Once you give that....&quot;

Karsta smiled at Cylene, the younger woman smiling back hopefully. Even 
as she unleashed her heat vision full power Karsta said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;YEARRGH!&quot; Cylene howled as she took the burst of heat vision right to 
the face, caught completely off guard by how well Karsta had hidden her 
thoughts. Blinded she staggered backwards, clutching her face as pain 
tore through her face like a knife.

Knowing Cylene would recover fast Karsta took off, flying up and 
punching right through the armored shell of Warworld and into space. 
Slipping her breathing unit back on she raced away as fast as she could, 
soaking up more pure sunlight as she ran.

&#39;I have to get to Earth,&#39; Karsta thought, &#39;they have to know what 
they&#39;re facing.&#39; As much as she hated to admit it if she had stayed to 
fight, Cylene would have beaten her. She seemed to have been holding 
back fighting Karsta, and she didn&#39;t want to imagine what the girl might 
do if she really got angry.

Shockingly, a familiar voice intruded in her mind. &quot;YOU&#39;LL PAY FOR WHAT 
YOU&#39;VE DONE,&quot; Cybele said bleakly, her voice a roar in Karsta&#39;s brain, 
&quot;I&#39;LL SEE YOU BROKEN FOR THIS.&quot;

Summoning much of her remaining power, Karsta poured on the speed. 
&#39;Yes,&#39; she thought to herself, &#39;I think she&#39;s pissed off.&#39;
