<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 1 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../a-ko/index.html">Project A-ko</a>

<pre>The girl in the armor looked up in the sky with an expression of numb 
shock, watching as the ship shrank to a glittering star in the sky, then 
it was simply gone. &quot;We have to go after her,&quot; she turned to say to the 
other girl, her long blue hair swinging behind her.

&quot;Tell me how, please,&quot; the red head said simply in reply, her school 
uniform torn and scorched, bearing the scars of the recent battle.

The other girl turns, and tears glimmer in her eyes, &quot;But she&#39;s in 
there! We have to save her!&quot; The tears began to fall faster, and she 
finally broke down, sobbing, &quot;We promised...&quot;

The school girl took her friend by the shoulders and gently said, &quot;Even 
if either of us could get into orbit, we don&#39;t have a ship, or any other 
way to try and chase them. This time, we have to let others handle 
this.&quot;

Slap! &quot;I hate you, A-ko!&quot; B-Ko cried out, tears streaking her face.



Project A-ko: The New Adventures of Supergirl Part One

&quot;You&#39;ve got to get out of here,&quot; A-ko said intensely.

B-ko looked over at her disbelievingly. &quot;What?&quot; she asked her softly, 
and, &quot;Didn&#39;t you just hear what I said?&quot;

&quot;We just totaled the school and a good sized chunk of the city,&quot; A-ko 
ignored the question as she explained, &quot;and everybody saw me! My secret 
is blown...&quot;

B-ko&#39;s eyes were widening a bit as she began to see her point. &quot;But what 
does that have to do with me?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Baka!&quot; A-ko barked out. &quot;Nobody knows for sure who&#39;s in that armor your 
wearing,&quot; she said to her angrily, &quot;unless they get close enough to see 
your face.&quot; She turned, and by focusing her vision on the distance she 
could see the trucks and vans bearing the news crews were already on 
their way. &quot;Get out of here!&quot; she repeated.

B-ko hesitated a moment, then she nodded. Quietly, she said, &quot;This isn&#39;t 
over, A-ko.&quot; With that, she activated her flight mode and was gone.

&quot;Wish I could do that,&quot; A-ko muttered under her breath. She tensed her 
legs and leapt, bounding across the city to her home. She reached the 
little house in a few leaps, and found it empty. She had expected it, of 
course. Once knowledge of her powers got out, theories about her parents 
couldn&#39;t be far behind.

A-ko held up one of her metal arm bracelets, and gently tapped a 
carefully memorized sequence on it. A soft shimmer of light, and she was 
gone.

Only to reappear on the Moon. The massive structure stretched out around 
her as she looked about in no little awe. &quot;The Watchtower,&quot; A-ko 
murmured. The final headquarters of the Justice League, it had been 
built as a fortress, a place to watch over the Earth and to protect it 
from attack from within or outside.

Of course, that was before things gradually quieted down in the early 
twenty-first century. The heroes began to appear less and less, until 
finally even the originals, Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, 
disappeared.

After pulling on a change of clothes from a storage locker, a sweat- 
pant garbed A-ko took the route she had memorized several years ago, 
even though she had never been up here herself. A few wrong turns later, 
and she found herself in the monitor room.

&#39;Dad looks better in the costume,&#39; A-ko found herself thinking, looking 
over at Superman standing in front of a bank of screens. He turned to 
her and smiled as he asked, &quot;Any trouble with the trip up here?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; A-ko reassured him. She scowled, seeing the image of the 
starship leaving the solar system, then disappearing in a flash of 
light.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; her mother reassured her, &quot;we&#39;ll catch them.&quot; Wonder 
Woman looked the same as she always had, having shed the false attempts 
at aging her appearance.

&#39;I wonder how hard it was for them, playing the salaryman and his wife?&#39; 
A-ko found herself thinking. &quot;I&#39;m going with you,&quot; she said simply.

&quot;No,&quot; Superman said quietly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;re not ready for this.&quot;

&quot;But Dad, I promised I&#39;d help rescue C-ko...&quot; A-ko started.

&quot;I promise you, we&#39;ll do all we can to get her back,&quot; Wonder Woman said 
softly. She stepped over to A-ko&#39;s side and hugged her gently, &quot;You&#39;re 
not ready, and I won&#39;t let you put yourself in grave jeopardy because of 
your pride.&quot;

&quot;If it was Artemis or one of the amazons who had been kidnapped,&quot; A- ko 
said to her intensely, &quot;you&#39;d insist on going along.&quot;

&quot;And if I was wise, I&#39;d listen to my mother telling me not to go,&quot; 
Wonder Woman smiled down at her gently.

&quot;Besides which, with both of us gone someone needs to be here to watch 
over the world,&quot; Superman said.

A-ko looked a bit startled at that. &quot;I thought you had retired?&quot; she 
asked.

&quot;No, just operated a lot quieter,&quot; Wonder Woman smiled. &quot;Which reminds 
me, I have a gift for you,&quot; she said, and pressed a small necklace into 
her hands.

A-ko looked at her oddly, then at the little theater mask dangling on 
the chain. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; she asked quietly.

&quot;Have you ever wondered why you have red hair when both of us have 
black?&quot; Superman smiled. &quot;It&#39;s thanks to that,&quot; he nodded towards the 
little necklace, &quot;a charm made up by a magician friend of ours.&quot;

A-ko looked at it a bit dubiously, then she cupped her hands around the 
little mask. A soft glow, and her hair shifted from red to deep black, 
flowing straight down her back. &quot;Wow,&quot; she murmured, looking at her 
reflection in a window.

Wonder Woman had an odd look on her face. She rummaged through a pile of 
clothes and passed a pair of glasses to A-ko. &quot;Try these on,&quot; she said.

A-ko slipped them on, and blinked in surprise. The glasses, plus the 
straight dark hair made her look almost completely different, like a 
whole different person. &quot;This could work,&quot; A-ko admitted.

&quot;Now we just need to establish a new identity for you,&quot; Superman smiled. 
He raised his voice, &quot;Oracle?&quot;

In front of them a three dimensional hologram of a red-headed young 
woman appeared. She sat in a wheelchair, and her glasses gleamed as she 
cradled a laptop on her knees. &quot;I&#39;m in the Japanese population database, 
and ready to go,&quot; she reported with a smile. She looked over at A-ko, 
&quot;Do you have a first name you&#39;d prefer?&quot;

A-ko was still looking in astonishment at the hologram. The question was 
repeated, and A-ko blushed redly, &quot;Sorry. Uhm, maybe Laurel?&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Oracle answered, typing away. She looked up, &quot;Last name?&quot;

Superman looked over at Wonder Woman, who nodded. &quot;Kent,&quot; he spoke up.

&quot;Laurel Kent,&quot; Oracle smiled, &quot;not bad.&quot; She typed away, &quot;I&#39;m keeping 
much of your personal statistics the same, and reporting the ID lost. A 
replacement is being FedExed to your new address now.&quot;

&quot;New address?&quot; A-ko said blankly as the hologram disappeared. &quot;And who 
is she?&quot; she asked quietly.

&quot;We set up an alternate address in Graviton City under the Kent name,&quot; 
Wonder Woman explained to her with a smile. &quot;Oracle is the artificial 
intelligence that runs the Watchtower, based on the persona of a former 
member of the JLA,&quot; she smiled.

&quot;There&#39;s something that we need to ask you,&quot; Superman said quietly. He 
took a deep breath, &quot;I was wondering if you would be willing to become 
Supergirl.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; A-ko squeaked.</pre>
