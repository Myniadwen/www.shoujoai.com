<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 11 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../a-ko/index.html">Project A-ko</a>

<a href="../a-ko/supergirl-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>        &#39;It looks much the same,&#39; he noted as he swiftly approached the 
Watchtower, flying through the darkness of space under his own power. 
The green skinned man passed ghost-like through the outer skin of the 
fortress easily, dropping down into one of the corridors. No alarms went 
off, the long hallway remaining utterly silent.

        &#39;Are the security systems down?&#39; he wondered, when he heard a 
soft sound coming from directly behind him. He turned around carefully, 
to see a petite blonde in a maid&#39;s uniform standing behind him, a very 
large energy weapon extended out from her arm and pointed at his head. 
He tried to scan her thoughts, but was completely unable to pick 
anything up.

        &quot;Identify yourself, please,&quot; D-ko said quite calmly. She 
recognized him immediately, of course, but it seemed safer to make sure. 
A JLA membership card was drawn out, and she scanned it quickly for 
authenticity.

        J&#39;onn J&#39;onz, also known as the Martian Manhunter, asked her, 
&quot;You&#39;re an robot of some kind, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

        &quot;Identity confirmed,&quot; D-ko passed the card back to him even as 
she slid the weapon back into her arm mount. &quot;Yes, I&#39;m a robot, as well 
as very sorry about that,&quot; she added with a cute little smile. &quot;Oracle?&quot; 
she looked up and said loudly.

        There was a shimmer, and the hologram appeared nearby. &quot;I told 
you it was him,&quot; Oracle said to D-ko with a smile. She turned to him, 
&quot;Hello J&#39;onn, it&#39;s good to see you again.&quot;

        &quot;Good to see you,&quot; J&#39;onn nodded. He looked curiously at the 
little blonde, &quot;And you are?&quot;

        &quot;D-ko,&quot; she smiled cheerfully. She turned to Oracle, &quot;I&#39;ll get 
back to my duties.&quot; With that, she strode away quickly and almost 
silently.

        Oracle and J&#39;onn smoothly fell into step, heading towards the 
central facilities of the Watchtower. &quot;So what brings you here?&quot; Oracle 
finally asked him.

        &quot;I picked up this message from my home on Mars,&quot; a very serious 
looking J&#39;onn held up a small silvery data-disk, &quot;I rather doubt it was 
powerful enough to reach the Moon.&quot;

        &quot;Superman and Wonder Woman?&quot; Oracle asked.

        J&#39;onn nodded, &quot;They stopped at home before they felt, told me of 
their mission.&quot; A slight smile, &quot;And about their daughter.&quot; They reached 
the monitor room and he headed to one of the consoles to slide the 
silvery disk into the reader.

        Oracle quickly scanned it, a frown on her face. Finally she said 
to him quietly, &quot;I think I&#39;d better get the others up here.&quot;

        &quot;The others?&quot; the Martian raised an eyebrow.

        It didn&#39;t take very long for the girls to arrive. Supergirl and 
Steel were first, having just gotten out of school when they received 
the message. A-ko smiled happily as soon as she saw him, &quot;It&#39;s good to 
see you, J&#39;onn!&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;ve grown up,&quot; J&#39;onn noted as he gave her a hug.

        &quot;It&#39;s been nearly ten years,&quot; A-ko shrugged. She swiftly pulled 
Steel forward, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet my friend B-ko.&quot;

        B-ko didn&#39;t seem too terribly thrown by the seven foot tall 
green man in front of her, offering her hand and coolly saying, &quot;Nice to 
meet you.&quot;

        Kestrel, led in by D-ko, was the last to arrive but only by a 
few minutes. Oracle smiled at J&#39;onn, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Kestrel.&quot; She 
quite deliberately didn&#39;t introduce the black and purple clad woman by 
her real name, leaving that up to Kestrel.

        Kestrel pushed her cowl back, ruffling her short black hair with 
a hand. &quot;Helena Wayne,&quot; she shook his hand, adding, &quot;My grandfather 
speaks highly of you.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll have to stop in, see Bruce,&quot; J&#39;onn said, &quot;and thank him 
for that.&quot;

        Helena looked over to Oracle and asked, &quot;What&#39;s the situation?&quot;

        &quot;There&#39;s been a new message from Superman and Wonder Woman,&quot; 
Oracle said, activating a screen with a gesture.

        There was simply snow at first, and even when the image came up 
it was static filled and badly distorted. Superman looked tired, 
somehow, as if he hadn&#39;t gotten much rest lately. &quot;We&#39;ve visited 
Almerac,&quot; he said, &quot;and what we&#39;ve found was unexpected.&quot;

        Wonder Woman looked pained, &quot;The planet had been utterly 
stripped of it&#39;s resources. Mines dig deep into the ground, and have 
extracted every precious fuel source or trace of organic life from the 
planet. It&#39;s utterly dead.&quot;

        Superman nodded gravely, &quot;There&#39;s no trace remaining that the 
people of Almerac had ever been here.&quot; He paused, &quot;There&#39;s a powerful 
spacial disruption, leaving here and moving off into space. We&#39;re going 
to follow it, try to see what the connection might be.&quot;

        &quot;We miss you, A-ko,&quot; Wonder Woman said softly, &quot;and I hope that 
you are well.&quot; A slight smile, &quot;Be careful, you and those that are 
standing by you.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll return home as soon as we can,&quot; Superman added, before 
the message finally broke up completely. The screen went to static for a 
few moments before Oracle shut it down.

        J&#39;onn had an odd look on his face once the message came to an 
end. &quot;He actually sounded worried,&quot; he murmured softly.

        &quot;I think you&#39;re right,&quot; Oracle quietly agreed.

        &quot;So what do we do about it?&quot; B-ko asked, looking around at the 
women and one man standing in the monitor room.

        &quot;Start to prepare for the worst,&quot; Helena said flatly. The eyes 
of all the others were on her as she continued, &quot;We were going to keep 
on expanding this Justice League anyway, this just gives us a bit more 
urgent reason.&quot;

        The eyes in the room turned to A-ko next, looking at her 
questioningly. &quot;I think it&#39;s a good idea,&quot; A-ko admitted. &quot;Right now if 
something really big hits, I don&#39;t know if we would be enough to handle 
it,&quot; she added.

        &quot;I agree,&quot; B-ko said, and D-ko nodded in the background.

        &quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Oracle nodded, &quot;and I have a nomination 
for our first new member.&quot; She looked over at the Martian Manhunter, 
&quot;J&#39;onn?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d be honored,&quot; J&#39;onn said, &quot;if there are no objections?&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;d be an asset,&quot; Helena smiled.

        &quot;A-ko likes you,&quot; B-ko shrugged, &quot;that&#39;s enough for now.&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t disagree,&quot; D-ko said.

        &quot;Looks like you&#39;re in,&quot; A-ko grinned at him.

        &quot;This is going to be interesting,&quot; J&#39;onn murmured, looking 
around at the five young women who curretly made up the Justice League.</pre>
