The beeping pierced the darkness of the Gotham city
apartment, two figures on the bed moving irritably as
it awakened them. &quot;I think,&quot; Barbara Gordon-Lance said
from beneath the covers, &quot;it&#39;s your JLA beeper.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me,&quot; Dinah Gordon-Lance
sighed as the blonde got up, rooting around on the
dresser beside their bed for the device. &quot;Yes?&quot; she
demanded crossly.

&quot;Sorry to call you,&quot; the familiar voice said as she
quietly explained, &quot;but things have gone straight to
hell.&quot;

&quot;Allison?&quot; Dinah straightened in surprise.

Allison Queen, the daughter of Dinah and Oliver
Queen&#39;s brief affair years ago, continued on
apologeticly, &quot;I&#39;m being held by the Justice League,
and there&#39;s no way Kestrel or the others will buy my
story without you backing me up.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Dinah nodded, &quot;I&#39;ll be up to the Watchtower
asap.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; and Allison signed off.

&quot;What do you mean, you&#39;ll be up there?&quot; Barbara
sighed, her red hair messy from sleep, &quot;I&#39;m going
too.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to,&quot; Dinah squeezed her shoulder.

&quot;Oh yes I do,&quot; Barbara sat up, using her arms to shift
her mostly immobile legs into position, &quot;or had you
forgotten that Kestrel is going to be a wee bit upset
by our not telling her about it? You&#39;re going to need
me there to help calm her down.&quot;

Dinah winced, &quot;Point.&quot; Reaching over she grabbed
Barbara&#39;s leg braces and passed them to her, &quot;Here.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Barbara pulled her pants on, then locked the
braces in place over her damaged legs. Levering
herself up she headed to the closet to grab a fresh
shirt and asked, &quot;What do you want to wear?&quot;

&quot;Just some street clothes,&quot; Dinah said wryly, &quot;I&#39;ve
gotten a bit too out of shape for wearing the old
costume.&quot;

&quot;You looked good in it the last time we played hero
and villain,&quot; Barbara teased.

Dinah blushed, &quot;thanks, but don&#39;t mention that to
Helena. I think she&#39;d die knowing we have sex lives.&quot;

&quot;Actually, I&#39;m pretty sure she knows,&quot; Barbara tossed
a pair of slacks and a blouse to Dinah as she buttoned
up her shirt.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Dinah pulled her pants on.

&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure I heard a door open that time we were
on the couch,&quot; Babs said with a blush, &quot;but then you
did... well, let&#39;s say I got distracted from
mentioning it at the time.&quot;

&quot;Oh boy,&quot; Dinah winced as she did up her shirt.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Babs sighed.

Dressed and as ready as they were ever going to be
they stood in the living room and activated the
transport sequences on their JLA communicators. There
was a moment of vertigo as the teleport effect
surrounded them, then they were gone.

&quot;Welcome aboard,&quot; Oracle said, the teenaged android
smiling as she hurried over to where Babs was getting
sick into a bucket.

&quot;Transporter tummy ache,&quot; Dinah explained as she
gently rubbed Bab&#39;s back.

&quot;Ouch,&quot; Oracle made a face.

Babs straightened up, visibly uncomfortable to be face
to face with a woman who looked so much like a younger
reflection of her. Their eyes, hair and bodies were
all roughly the same, in addition to sharing most of
the same memories and personality. Babs didn&#39;t regret
allowing the JLA to copy her mind into the Watchtower
to create a new Oracle, but uit did make for odd
moments like this.

&quot;All right.&quot; Babs said firmly, &quot;we need a conference
room, Kestrel, and the captive super villain Vox,
please.&quot;

&quot;Is that wise?&quot; Oracle asked, faintly surprised.

&quot;I think it could be important,&quot; Babs answered firmly.

The conference room was on a upper level of the
Watchtower, with a long table and a window looking out
on the moon&#39;s airless surface. With a happy sigh Babs
sat down as Dinah gave her a worried look, &quot;You all
right?&quot;

&quot;Just on my feet too long,&quot; Babs admitted, &quot;the braces
Bruce had his company make me are good, but not
perfect.&quot;

A few moments later Kestrel arrived, the purple and
black garbed younger woman frowning, &quot;This is a bad
idea, Moms.&quot;

&quot;Good to see you too,&quot; Dinah smiled, &quot;too busy to say
hi?&quot;

Kestrel blushed faintly, &quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t this sweet?&quot; Vox sneered.

&quot;You...&quot; Kestrel looked angry.

&quot;You can cut the act,&quot; Babs said, &quot;we&#39;re going to have
to tell Kestrel anyway.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&#39; Kestrel looked honestly startled.

Vox seemed to relax a bit, &quot;You sure?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re bringing you in from the cold,&quot; Babs said
firmly.

Dinah turned to the now badly confused looking
Kestrel, &quot;You see Vox is a Bird of Prey, more or
less.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Kestrel screeched.

&quot;Told you she wasn&#39;t going to take it well,&quot; Babs
sighed. She looked over at their masked adopted
daughter, &quot;It&#39;s a long story...&quot;

After a very long explanation later Kestrel sat down
with a sigh. &quot;I can barely believe it,&quot; she finally
said. She looked over at Vox, &quot;What about those
charges against you?&quot;

&quot;The minor crimes are real,&quot; Vox said to her frankly,
&quot;the murder charge is something Babs cooked up her
hacking skills.&quot;

&quot;So what would have happened if a order came in to
execute you based on that?&quot; Kestrel asked with a
faintly shocked look, reaching up to pull back her
costume&#39;s cowl.

&quot;We&#39;d have revealed that the charge was a hoax to a
reliable judge,&quot; Vox shrugged, &quot;maybe Kate Spender,
the previous Manhunter.&quot;

&quot;And you two decided to keep this a secret from be
because...?&quot; Kestrel turned to ask Babs and Dinah
grimly, her black hair stuck to her head by sweat.

&quot;You were going to be in situations where you were
fighting each other in the field,&quot; Dinah said, &quot;and
you&#39;re not a good actress, Helena. You had to be
perfectly believable or the criminals would suspect
that Allison was faking.&quot;

&quot;I am not that bad an actress,&quot; Helena said stiffly.

&quot;Then how come B-ko already knows you&#39;re interested in
her?&quot; Dinah countered.

&quot;Mom!&quot; Helena blushed.

&quot;Which reminds me,&quot; Allison quickly jumped in, &quot;why
did you say you were bringing me in from the cold?&quot;

&quot;I talked to Oracle,&quot; Babs said quietly, &quot;according to
her, the villain Cylene was in all of your minds.&quot;

&quot;Yes...?&quot; Allison asked, clearly not getting it.

&quot;If she did read your mind she may know you&#39;re
undercover,&quot; Babs clarified, &quot;then decide to reveal it
at the worst possible time.&quot;

&quot;Crap,&quot; Allison groaned.

&quot;So,&quot; Helena said after a moment, &quot;what do we do with
Allison now?&quot;

There was a long beat of silence, then Dinah smiled a
little. &quot;You know,&quot; she said, &quot;I think I have a idea.&quot;

A few moments later, a costume request to Oracle and a
change of clothes and Allison emerged, the new uniform
hugging her body. Designed in black it had gold
accents on her boots and gloves and a gold bird emblem
on the chest. She pulled the half mask in place over
her eyes as she asked, &quot;So who am I supposed to be?&quot;

Babs smiled in satisfaction, &quot;The new Black Canary.&quot;

Allison looked over the suit critically and said,
&quot;Well, at least you didn&#39;t go for the fishnet
stockings.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t wait till I have to explain this to
Supergirl,&quot; Helena shook her head.

&quot;Just tell her that two former JLA members vouch for
her,&quot; Dinah grinned, &quot;it&#39;s the absolute truth, after
all.&quot;</pre>
