<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 37 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../a-ko/index.html">Project A-ko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../a-ko/supergirl-ch36.html">Back to Part 36</a><pre>Kestrel lead the way into the meeting room, leading a
figure in a familiar looking black costume.
&quot;Everyone,&quot; she said briskly, &quot;this is the new Black
Canary.&quot;

The tall blonde smiled, her costume mostly black with
gold accents, a half mask shielding her face. &quot;Ladies,
gents,&quot; Allison Queen nodded respectfully.

&quot;I think I can guess who you are,&quot; Supergirl murmured,
the redheaded A-ko studying her thoughtfully. &quot;Why
should we accept you?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I&#39;m willing to vouch for her,&quot; Oracle noted, the
redheaded android having followed the two women
inside.

&quot;As are my mothers,&quot; Kestrel gave a wry smile as
Helena Wayne asked the assembled group, &quot;that enough?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d say it&#39;s good enough for me,&quot; Steel conceded, the
blue haired young woman sitting at the round table
with the others. B-ko looked serious as she asked, &quot;Is
there any more information from our captives?&quot;

&quot;Nothing new,&quot; J&#39;onn J&#39;onzz the Martian Manhunter
sounded frustrated as the green skinned alien
elaborated, &quot;only Roulette seems to know who they were
really working for, and her knowledge is barely better
than our own.&quot;

&quot;How did she hook up with Cylene?&quot; Green Lantern asked
as she politely held out a seat for Oracle.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Oracle smiled.

Kyla Scott blushed slightly as the green haired girl
answered, &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;

J&#39;onn looked amused at their interaction but
explained, &quot;Apparently Cylene visited Roulette in her
dreams, offering her power and glory in return for
service.&quot;

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Hawkwoman growled, Katar Hol sitting at the
end of the table, her metalic wings giving her a
dangerous look.

Kestrel nodded grimly as she muttered, &quot;I&#39;d much
rather be investigating a nice, straight forward
mystery than this sort of thing.&quot;

&quot;And the refugees?&quot; Aqualad asked, the redheaded young
man looking calmly intent.

&quot;Lexcorp has finished the repairs and they&#39;re already
fleeing the system,&quot; D-ko revealed, the blonde haired
robot girl getting up to dish up some snacks. &quot;A few
have stayed behind, though,&quot; she added.

&quot;Like?&quot; Dr. Fate asked. Lyta Hall&#39;s golden cape
swirled as the white haired woman drank her tea, her
eyes thoughtful.

&quot;Starfire and Nightstar,&quot; D-ko said, keeping a
slightly wary eye on Kestrel, &quot;have apparently chosen
to stay on Paradise Island.&quot;

&quot;Huh,&quot; B-ko frowned.

Firestorm sat by Flash, his flaming hair and blank
white eyes giving him a eerie air. &quot;Al least things
are quiet on Earth,&quot; he offered.

:&quot;For now,&quot; Flash said, the red bodysuit clad Iris
West smiling wryly, &quot;just wait till the people hear
about Warworld. There&#39;ll be a panic.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully the Justice Society and other heroic groups
will be able to keep a lid on things,&quot; A-ko said
briskly.

&quot;Lets&#39;s hope,&quot; Black Canary nodded. She hesitated a
moment, &quot;has anyone considered formally contacting the
Secret Society of Supervillains?&quot;

&quot;Already working on it,&quot; Kestrel said smugly.

The SSOSV was a powerful organization, one that had
existed for almost as long as the Justice League
itself. First organized among minor villains it slowly
grew in power, until at it&#39;s peak it had been led by
Luthor himself and was one of the most powerful forces
on Earth. Even now without such legends in it&#39;s ranks,
the Society was a force to be reckoned with.

&quot;I still feel a bit uncomfortable about appealing to
them for help against the coming invasion,&quot; A-ko
admitted.

&quot;Who are you sending to talk to them?&quot; Kyla asked.

&quot;My associate Raven,&quot; Kestrel said, refering to
Cassandra Cain, once called the Batgirl, &quot;will be
meeting with their current leader Nyssa Head, the
leader of the League of Assassins.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d kill to be a fly on the wall of that meeting,&quot;
J&#39;onn admitted, well aware of the two women&#39;s
background together.

&quot;Ditto,&quot; B-ko nodded. She smiled wryly as she asked,
&quot;Who wants to bet there&#39;s going to be a fight?&quot;

Helena actually chuckled softly, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t bet
against that.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0

The black clad woman stalked through the alley&#39;s of
Gotham like she owned them, her full face mask
concealing all of her features. She was slim, capable,
and the only thing that stood out on her black clothes
was the golden bird emblem on her chest.

&quot;Hyaa!&quot; a figure burst from the shadows dressed in red
and gold.

Without a word Raven deflected the strike, calmly
parrying the masked woman&#39;s attack. Blades flashed but
she dodged like black water, the weapons unable to
even touch her. Back and forth they fought, the black
clad woman barely seeming to break a sweat until...

&quot;Enough,&quot; the voice called, &quot;Shrike, you&#39;re
embarrassing us.&quot;

&quot;But ma&#39;am...&quot; Shrike started.

With extra emphasis she said, &quot;Enough.&quot;

Shrike bowed slightly as she walked away, &quot;Yes,
ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Hello, Nyssa,&quot; Raven said with a gentler tone of
voice, &quot;it&#39;s been awhile.&quot;

Nyssa Raatko, also known as Nyssa Al Ghul and Nyssa
Head smiled, her short black hair styled in a boyish
way. &quot;It&#39;s been a long time, Beloved,&quot; she purred,
drawing Raven into a embrace.

Raven pulled back her hood and Cassandra Cain smiled,
looking up at Nyssa tenderly. &quot;That it has,&quot; she
agreed, &quot;are we going to have to fight?&quot;

Nyssa sighed as she pulled Cassandra into a kiss. &quot;Not
today,&quot; she murmured, &quot;not until I business is
concluded.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Cassandra agreed.

&quot;My apologies for the new Shrike,&quot; Nyssa sighed,
&quot;she&#39;s a good enough bodyguard, but clearly her skills
need work.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you can take care of yourself,&quot; Cassandra
frowned, &quot;a Shiva would kill Shrike in a few moments.&quot;

&quot;Thankfully the latest Shiva is in my employ,&quot; Nyssa
smirked. Her explression became more serious as she
asked, &quot;What does the Justice League want of us?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s threat coming to all of us,&quot; Cassandra said
grimly then passed on a sketchy briefing on the
invasion force.

Nyssa listened intently. &quot;The woman Roulette attempted
to approach me,&quot; she admitted, &quot;but I knew such an
alliance would put us in opposition, so I said no.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Cassandra answered softly.

&quot;As am I Beloved,&quot; Nyssa stroked her cheek. Shaking
her head a bit she said, &quot;I&#39;ll bring this to the
Society, then let you know.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Cassandra reached out to kiss her once
more.

Nyssa pulled her close. &quot;Do you ever regret leaving
the League,&quot; she murmured, &quot;and returning to Gotham?&quot;

&quot;Occasionally,&quot; Cassandra quietly admitted, &quot;but when
I was in the league, I couldn&#39;t be your lover.&quot;

Nyssa chuckled warmly, &quot;Very true.&quot; She drew back
reluctantly, &quot;I look forward to our next meeting,
Beloved.&quot;

&quot;See you soon,&quot; Cassandra agreed as Nyssa seemed to
disappear into the night.
