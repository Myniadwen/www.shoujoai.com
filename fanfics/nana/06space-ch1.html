<h1>06 The Space Between Dream and Reality</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nana/index.html">Nana</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hwingwhit.html">Heath Wingwhit</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Authors Note: I got this from a friend who got it from a site. It&#39;s a 
challenge, to take a couple and do thirty kisses with them. They don&#39;t 
have to be sexual, but they can be, or romantic or friendly and such and 
such. I chose Hachi and Nana, but in this one I kind of cheated. This 
revolves around some of the stuff in the later volumes

The sixth challenge was &quot;The Space Between Dream and Reality.&quot; This was 
my go at that.

--

Hachi stared at her cell phone. There are no new messages. She narrowed 
her eyes softly and set the phone to the side on the small bedside 
table. It was true that she was all alone now. Takumi was in the studio 
working as usual. Junko and Kyosuke were so far away. She could no 
longer see Blast. Yasu, Shin, Nobu... Nana. All of them were lost to her 
now.

Her hand reached out to the phone again. She&#39;d call her. It would be 
fine, if she could just talk to her, if she could just tell her.

No. She couldn&#39;t. Biting her lower lip she crawled under the sheets of 
the bed and pulled them over her head. It was no use thinking about it. 
She&#39;d left a letter but Nana hadn&#39;t called. There was a burning that 
wasn&#39;t immediately identifiable. It wasn&#39;t until she felt the warm salt 
on her lips that she realized her tears. Pulling into herself she closed 
her eyes.

She felt sick.

--

They were in 707 once more. All of them were present, Nobu, Yasu, Shin, 
a penguin, and Nana. They were all playing cards, the penguin included. 
Nobu kept looking over at the penguin&#39;s cards. &quot;That&#39;s cheating!&quot; Nana 
yelled, pointing viciously, &quot;Damn it, are all short statured people so 
sneaky? Quit cheating, Nobu, or you&#39;ll never get laid!&quot;

&quot;That might be the only way he would,&quot; Shin said puffing on a cigarette. 
He turned his kind eyes to Hachi. &quot;Do you want in next round?&quot;

&quot;Dogs don&#39;t know how to play,&quot; Nana told him in an informational kind of 
way and turned to Hachi. &quot;Do you want to sit in my lap, puppy?&quot;

Hachi&#39;s face turned crimson. &quot;Um...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t tease her,&quot; Yasu said as he folded. &quot;Penguin, you haven&#39;t gone 
yet.&quot;

&quot;Um,&quot; Hachi started again, &quot;why is there a penguin at the table...?&quot;

They all looked at her incredulously. Hachi thought that she might get a 
response out of them, but they didn&#39;t find the question fit for 
answering. Hachi went to the kitchen and took out a beer for herself, 
and one for Nana. Opening it, she set Nana&#39;s in front of her. &quot;Here.&quot;

&quot;Thanks!&quot; Nana pulled her into her lap to sit. Hachi&#39;s face burned 
further and she held on tightly to the cold can of beer.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t be drinking,&quot; Nobu told her. His eyes were colder and 
meaner than she remembered. &quot;Not in your condition.&quot;

&quot;Let her do as she likes!&quot; Nana yelled at him, &quot;It won&#39;t affect the 
litter.&quot;

&quot;The litter?&quot; Hachi asked.

&quot;That&#39;s why she got the penguin,&quot; Shin told her with a soft sigh. &quot;But 
it was Nobu who insisted.&quot;

&quot;We needed a mascot,&quot; Yasu said taking a card from the deck, &quot;and you 
were gone.&quot;

&quot;But, I&#39;m not really a dog. I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d let a penguin replace 
me.&quot; The penguin shot her a look and laid down a card. &quot;He seems very 
smart.&quot;

&quot;How do you know it&#39;s a He?&quot; Nana asked and reached around her to set 
down a few cards. &quot;How&#39;d I do? Damn! Nobu, you&#39;re cheating!&quot;

&quot;I am not!&quot; He said loudly. &quot;Don&#39;t blame me for your lack of skills! 
Anyway, I don&#39;t see why Nana gets to sit on your lap. She was my 
girlfriend.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Nana looked from Hachi to Nobu a few times. &quot;Is that true, 
Hachi?&quot; She nodded solemnly. There was something that tore at her heart 
at the question. &quot;Well then, it&#39;s only fair. Let him pet you,&quot; she 
pushed her to Nobu gently and picked up another cigarette before 
stopping. &quot;Hey! Yasu, Shin! All of you, put that away! Here!&quot; She pushed 
the ashtray at all of them, glaring until all the cigarettes had been 
put out. &quot;You too, Penguin.&quot; The penguin obliged.

&quot;This is so weird,&quot; Hachi said, &quot;I feel as if I&#39;m in a dream!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve missed you,&quot; Shin told her. &quot;Nana&#39;s been energy deprived lately.&quot;

&quot;Oh no!&quot; Hachi leaned forward. &quot;Nana, are you all right?&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot; She jumped to her feet and posed. &quot;I&#39;ve got to be strong if 
I&#39;m your hero, right, Hachi?&quot; Hachi smiled and watched Nana as she went 
to the cupboards and rifled through them. &quot;By the way, I&#39;ve got you a 
present! Close your eyes, Hachikou!&quot; Hachi did as asked and felt Nobu&#39;s 
fingers threading through her hair, his forehead resting against her 
back. She heard Nana&#39;s footsteps approaching. &quot;Open them!&quot;

She opened her eyes. There were two coffee mugs with cherries on a stem 
on them. &quot;Oh!&quot; She smiled widely. &quot;These are what I&#39;ve been wanting 
back! Nana!&quot; She jumped off Nobu&#39;s lap and wrapped her arms around 
Nana&#39;s neck. &quot;How&#39;d you know?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so cool like that,&quot; Nana boasted.

Hachi pulled away from her and looked at the mugs, picking them both up 
and examining them before setting them back down. She turned back to 
Nana who smiled gently and pressed her lips to hers, they were soft and 
tasted of cherries and salt. Nana kissed her back and the members of 
Blast, including Nobu and the penguin cheered.

--

&quot;What a reception.&quot; There was soft, deep chuckling.

Nana opened her eyes. Takumi had pulled back the sheets from the bed, 
his face so close to hers. &quot;Were you having a happy dream, Nana?&quot; She 
blinked at him and he knew that she didn&#39;t understand. &quot;You were smiling 
and crying. I assumed.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; She turned her eyes to the phone.

&quot;You don&#39;t have any new messages. I checked. Look, I brought you 
something,&quot; he handed her a lone glass with a cherry on it. &quot;Not quite 
strawberry but they were out. Do you like it?&quot;

Hachi couldn&#39;t hold back her tears. She didn&#39;t resist when he pulled her 
to him. Takumi stroked her hair, not minding how her tears soaked his 
shirt.
