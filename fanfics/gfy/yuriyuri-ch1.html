<h1>Yuri Sweet Yuri</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gfy/index.html">Galaxy Fraulein Yuna</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aliaaki.html">Alia Aki</a><br> </h2>
<pre>3... 2... 1... FIRE

A huge laser cannon fires down into the earth&#39;s atmosphere, down
into a densely populated city managing to avoid hitting any
buildings, but kicking up a lot of dirt on its way. The laser
eventually reaches its destination, a small house on the outskirts
of the city, which is promptly blown apart. 

&quot;What was that?&quot; cried an attractive blonde girl looking slightly
charred from the explosion. Next to her, a cute girl with short
red hair and a strange marking on her forehead looks up, she is
also slightly charred.

&quot;Yuri doesn&#39;t know either.&quot; She said. Just then a small screen
that somehow survived the explosion came alive and a beautiful
woman with long elegant hair appeared on the screen.

&quot;Good morning Yuna, it&#39;s the wake-up call you requested. See you
later.&quot; The woman smiled and the screen blipped out.

&quot;Princess Mirage&quot; Yuna sighed, &quot;Why can&#39;t she think of a way to
wake me up that doesn&#39;t involve destroying my house. It&#39;s getting
harder to get it rebuilt&quot; Yuna slowly got up.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Yuri will rebuild it for you while Yuna gets Yuri&#39;s
breakfast&quot; The shorthaired girl leapt into life and started
rebuilding the house at lightning speed. (Starting with the
kitchen) 

Yuna slowly wandered into the rebuilt bathroom and cleaned up
before going to the kitchen to get breakfast. She wondered just
how much to cook for Yuri. &#39;She has such a ravenous appetite, I
still don&#39;t know how she eats so much without being sick&#39; she
thought to herself. She decided she would make 10 bowls of rice, 6
bowls of miso soup with potato and a large tray of salmon for her.
&#39;She can get her own lunch though&#39; Yuna thought angrily as she
cooked.

&quot;Yuuuuuuuna is Yuri&#39;s breakfast ready? Yuri has finished the
house.&quot; Yuri said cheerfully as she walked into the kitchen. She
sat down and started eating nearly as quickly as she had rebuilt
the house. Yuna was only half way through her breakfast before she
had to fight Yuri off to stop her stealing it.

&quot;Where do you put all that food? I know you are a robot, but
nothing can eat that much as quickly as you do.&quot; Yuna asked when
she had finally managed to finish her breakfast.

&quot;It&#39;s Yuri&#39;s secret.&quot;

&quot;Meaning you don&#39;t know either, it&#39;s just something you do&quot; Yuna
replied &quot;Ack, we&#39;re going to be late for school&quot; She cried as she
ran upstairs to get changed.

Yuri stood by the door waiting for Yuna to return. To pass the
time she had decided to grab a few packs of Pocky to munch on.
Yuna came dashing down the stairs and grabbed Yuri by the arm as
she flew out of the door and charged down to the bus stop. &#39;I hope
we haven&#39;t missed the bus I don&#39;t want to walk all that way.&#39; Yuna
thought to herself.  Yuri was still oblivious devouring the Pocky. 

&quot;I might be able to go a bit faster if I didn&#39;t have to carry
you.&quot;

Yuri had finished her Pocky and switched places with Yuna. They
were now tearing around the streets at break neck speed and ended
up at school several minutes before the bus got there. Yuna looked
a bit dazed she hadn&#39;t been ready for one of Yuri&#39;s piggybacks. 

&quot;Could you please warn me next time?&quot; Yuna managed to say before
she collapsed on the grass.

&quot;Oooo, Yuri&#39;s sorry.&quot; Yuri whined as she tried to wake Yuna up.
After a few unsuccessful shakes and taps, she poured a bucket of
cold water on Yuna.

&quot;Bwaaaaaaaah&quot; Yuna screamed as she got up with a start. &quot;YURI&quot; she
shouted as she started chasing the girl around the school. Yuna
suddenly came to a halt as she saw a familiar face wandering
around the school corridor. She was a tall-ish girl with long
blonde hair and wearing a slightly old fashioned style of dress.

&quot;Shiori? What are you doing here?&quot; 

&quot;I... was... asked... to... fill... in... for... one... of...
the... teachers... for... a... week... or... two.&quot; Shiori replied

&quot;Really? That&#39;s really great, which room are you teaching in?&quot;
Yuna asked excitedly.

&quot;Um... room... 3A&quot; Yuna gulped hearing this. It was her class, she
may really like Shiori, but at her working pace they would be
lucky to get one full lesson in the entire week.

&quot;Ok Shiori I&#39;m going to be late for class if I don&#39;t go now, I&#39;ll
see you soon ok.&quot; Yuna then dashed off to her classroom.

------------------------------------------------------------

Yuna rushed to her desk only to find it taken up by one of Yuri&#39;s
infamous giant food trays, which Yuri was already halfway through
eating. There were already a couple of other students at their
desks, but most of them never turned up till a minute before the
bell anyway.

&quot;Yuri guess who we have for a substitute teacher this week.&quot; She
whispered to the girl slowly working through the rice part of the
meal. Yuri stopped for a second and looked over at Yuna.

&quot;Yuri doesn&#39;t know. Tell Yuri, please&quot; She made puppy eyes at
Yuna.

&quot;Shiori is our substitute&quot; Yuna replied. With that Yuri suddenly
froze and then panicking slightly she put the food tray away and
actually looked like she was being serious for once about
something that wasn&#39;t food related.

&quot;You aren&#39;t joking with Yuri are you?&quot; she said with a small whine
in her voice.

&quot;No I am perfectly serious, I just saw her in the corridor and she
told me she was subbing for class 3A.&quot; Yuri&#39;s face burst into a
huge smile.

&quot;Yay, Yuri really likes Miss Shiori. This week will be fun&quot; She
was now practically bouncing in her seat.

------------------------------------------------------------

Shiori slowly wandered into class and to her desk at the front of
the classroom.

&quot;Oh... Miss... Yuna... you... and... Yuri... are... in... my...
class... I... didn&#39;t... know... that.&quot; Shiori beamed a smile at
them and Yuri blushed although Yuna didn&#39;t notice.  Slowly the
rest of the class filtered in and sat at their desks.

&quot;This... week... I... will... be... standing... in... for...
Miss... Tokudaiji... as... she... has... gone... to... a...
week... long... sale... at... the... biggest... department...
store... in...  the... city.&quot; Shiori then wandered over to the
board and turned it on.  Written on it were the instructions for
the day&#39;s lesson.

&quot;I... was... told... to... let... you... work... from... the...
board... and... to... collect... your... work... at... the...
end... of... class&quot; Shiori then sat down as the class started to
read what was written on the board.

&quot;Well at least they wrote it all out for her so she didn&#39;t have to
read it to us&quot; Yuna whispered. Yuri suddenly looked offended.

&quot;Stop being mean about Miss Shiori&quot; Yuri whispered back. Yuna
looked taken back that Yuri was defending someone other than her.

&quot;Sorry Yuri, but you know what I mean. She is intelligent and very
powerful, but she does everything at such a slow pace. I have
never even seen her run in an emergency. She just isn&#39;t in a hurry
to do anything.&quot; She looked at Yuri who seemed to have calmed down
a bit; she no longer looked like she was going to explode.

The end of class bell rang and Yuri dashed down to hand her work
to Shiori. 

&quot;Here you go Miss Shiori.&quot; Yuri beamed at Shiori and blushed when
Shiori took her work from her.

&quot;Thankyou... Yuri.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Outside Yuna layed under a tree, staring up at the sky. &#39;I wonder
what&#39;s up with Yuri; she seems to be acting a little more friendly
to Shiori than she usually does. She&#39;s treating her better than
she treats me and we are best friends. She even stopped eating for
an entire lesson. I can&#39;t get her to stop eating for 5 minutes
normally.&#39; At this point Yuri returned from her trip to a nearby
bakery to buy some lunch. She dumped the tray full of cakes and
rolls on the ground; it was nearly as big as she was.

&quot;Did you get enough there Yuri?&quot; Yuna sweatdropped. 

&quot;No, but this is all Yuri could carry. The rest kept falling off.&quot;
Yuri mumbled out between mouthfuls of food. Yuna managed to sneak
2 rolls and a cake away without Yuri noticing and ate them quickly
before she was discovered. When Yuna looked around to see if Yuri
was glaring at her she realized that Yuri had stopped eating
again. Yuri was staring at something; Yuna followed her gaze and
noticed she was staring at Shiori.

&quot;What are you staring at?&quot; Yuna seemed startled and turned around
to see a girl with light purple hair.

&quot;Oh it&#39;s you Ria&quot; she sighed in relief

&quot;So what were you staring at?&quot; Ria asked again.

&quot;Oh I wasn&#39;t staring at anything, it&#39;s Yuri she seems to be a bit
pre-occupied by Shiori today.&quot; Yuna replied sounding a little
jealous.

&quot;Hmmmm, maybe she has a crush on her.&quot; Ria teased smiling at Yuna.

&quot;Ooooo, you. Yuri&#39;s not like that... is she?&quot; Yuna realizing that
she really didn&#39;t know much about Yuri on that side of things.
Yuri was always so devoted to Yuna (and food) that she had never
seen Yuri take an interest in anyone else.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, but anything&#39;s possible. She&#39;s hardly your average
robot. For a start she eats more than your average army. She seems
intelligent yet always acts like a small child. She even talks in
the third person all the time. Where did you find her again?&quot; Ria
said

&quot;I found her on the moon.&quot; Yuna replied absent-mindedly &quot;The
strangest thing is she stops eating when Shiori is around.&quot;

&quot;That is strange.&quot; 

Yuri had still not eaten and her gaze was slowly following Shiori
around the school grounds. She was getting really confused and
couldn&#39;t stop blushing. Weird thoughts kept running through her
mind, most of them involving her and Shiori taking long walks
together, cuddling, and sometimes kissing.

&quot;Yuri, Yuri, snap out of it, your food is going stale.&quot; With that
the shorthaired girl seemed to jump back to reality and turned to
Yuna looking confused before she devoured the rest of the food.

&quot;Oh yeah, that reminds me. I have a new spaceship. Did you two
want to come and take a test drive in it?&quot; Ria asked them.

&quot;Sure we would love to.&quot; Yuna replied enthusiastically. 

&quot;Is anyone else coming?&quot; asked Yuri.

&quot;No it was just you two since I know how much you love spaceships
Yuri.&quot; Yuri looked a little disappointed at this news, but nodded
anyway.

&#39;Maybe she has got a crush on her.&#39; Ria thought to herself.

------------------------------------------------------------

A little later that day after Yuri and Yuna had finished their
dinner.  Ria turned up to take them to her launch bay. 

&quot;You never did tell me why you built this chute under my house.&quot;
Yuna exclaimed to Ria.

&quot;In case of emergencies.&quot; She replied. They all reached the bottom
of the chute, some more gracefully than others. After Yuri picked
herself up she looked up at the ship. It was a bright gold color,
with a long pointed nose, long sleek jets on either side. It was
very aerodynamically designed. Which seemed a bit odd considering
it was meant for space travel, but they all thought it looked
really cool anyway.

&quot;Ooo, we get to fly in space in the halibut.&quot; Yuri sang as she ran
up and hugged the ship.

&quot;Will you please stop naming my ships?&quot; Ria muttered as she held
her head in one hand. Yuri however was not listening to her; she
was too busy hugging the ship.

&quot;Ok, everyone on board. Yuri there is a fully stocked kitchen if
you want to use it.&quot; Yuri bounced off to find the kitchen, while
Yuna and Ria went to the bridge. The bay doors opened and the ship
shot off at high speed up the ramp and straight out of the
atmosphere at blinding speed.

&quot;What do you think Yuna?&quot; Ria asked

&quot;It&#39;s a sports model isn&#39;t it?&quot; Yuna replied

After a few minutes Ria begun to slow the ship down and let it
cruise on autopilot for a while.

&quot;Now Yuna, it&#39;s still bothering you isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s bothering me?&quot; Yuna asked knowing full well what Ria
meant, but she didn&#39;t want to acknowledge it without a fight.

&quot;You haven&#39;t been bouncing around the bridge like you normally do
when we go on these trips, so I assume that Yuri&#39;s behavior is
getting to you.&quot; Ria stated bluntly.

Yuna sat there looking blank for a while; it was nearly a minute
before she actually spoke again.

&quot;Hmmm, I suppose I am kind of worried she will leave me. I am fine
with her wanting someone to love, but I always felt like we would
always be together. It never occurred to me she might actually
leave my side one day.&quot; Yuna&#39;s voice was shallow and Ria thought
she was going to burst into tears.

&quot;That&#39;s the first time I have heard the &#39;Savior of Light&#39; say
something that sounded so selfish.&quot; Yuna really did look like she
was about to cry now.

&quot;I mean would you leave Yuri if Lady Polylina said she wanted to
be with you?&quot; asked Ria. Yuna contemplated this for a moment
before answering.

&quot;I... I&#39;m not sure.&quot; 

&quot;Just because she&#39;s a robot, a weird robot, but still... she is so
human in many respects so shouldn&#39;t she be allowed to follow her
dreams? Or are your feelings for her more than friendship?&quot; Ria
stared at Yuna waiting for an answer. Yuna looked away she really
didn&#39;t want to answer that question. There was a reason she let
Yuri sleep in her room and sometimes in the same bed, but she
really didn&#39;t feel like admitting it. She didn&#39;t even like
admitting it to herself.

&quot;No, No it&#39;s nothing like that.&quot; She replied with a forced smile
on her face. Then Yuri decided to join them on the bridge with her
arms full of food.

&quot;This ship goes really fast, Yuri almost dropped her first bowl of
rice when you took off.&quot; Yuri said between mouthfuls of food.

They flew around for a little while longer and then Ria decided
they should get back, it would be getting late back on Earth and
they had school tomorrow. After returning to the underground
hanger, they all said goodnight and went to bed.

The next morning found Yuri rebuilding the house again while Yuna
got breakfast. 

&quot;I really have to remember to tell her to just call me to get me
up.&quot; Yuna said quietly to herself. Yuna decided to eat as she was
cooking Yuri&#39;s to avoid the fight and so she could get dressed a
bit earlier so they wouldn&#39;t miss the bus today.

------------------------------------------------------------

They arrived at school without much incident this time, although
Yuna wasn&#39;t looking her cheerful self. Yuri was too busy eating to
notice though until she ran out of food.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; Yuri asked her. &quot;Has Yuri done something to
upset Yuna?&quot; Yuri started looking apologetic.

&quot;It&#39;s nothing Yuri, you haven&#39;t upset me.&quot; She smiled at Yuri and
Yuri cheered up again.

Class went by as usual, but Yuna stayed behind and let Yuri go off
to buy their lunch. Yuna made sure everyone had left the
classroom; she then wandered over to Shiori.

&quot;Shiori, can I ask you a question?&quot;

&quot;Sure... what... is... it... Yuna?&quot; Shiori replied

&quot;Um... It&#39;s about Yuri. Have you noticed anything strange about
her recently?&quot; she asked shyly.

&quot;No... I... don&#39;t... think... so&quot;

&quot;Ok I&#39;ll ask another question, please don&#39;t be shocked at this. Do
you find Yuri attractive in &#39;That&#39; way?&quot; Yuna sounded awkward when
asking this. Shiori stared at her for a while a bit confused by
the question and then seemed to think about it.

&quot;No... she&#39;s... very... cute... and... funny... but... I... am...
not... attracted... to... her.&quot;

Yuna didn&#39;t know whether to be relieved or feel sorry for Yuri.

&quot;Thanks Shiori.&quot; Yuna said as she ran out of the classroom to find
Yuri.

------------------------------------------------------------

She found her sitting under the usual tree, but this time the food
seemed to be in 2 piles, one was a lot smaller than the other and
was obviously the one Yuri had set aside for Yuna. Yuna slowly
walked over and sat down. She started to eat without saying a word
and watched her best friend. &#39;Right now she seems to be fine, I
wonder what she will do when she finds out Shiori doesn&#39;t have the
same feelings for her.&#39; They finished eating in silence.

&quot;Are you sure Yuri hasn&#39;t done anything to upset Yuna?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m very sure Yuri, you couldn&#39;t do anything that would upset me.
I can&#39;t even stay mad at you for stealing my food sometimes.&quot; Yuri
beamed a huge grin at Yuna, just as Ria arrived.

&quot;Um could I talk to Yuri in private please Yuna?&quot; She said calmly.

&quot;Sure, this will give me a chance to tell Princess Mirage to give
us a gentler wake-up call.&quot; With that she ran off to the nearest
vid-phone.

Ria took Yuri by the arm and led her into the forest round the
back of the school away from any possible eavesdroppers. 

&quot;Yuri I have something important to ask you. You will have to be
serious for once.&quot;

&quot;Ok Yuri will be serious.&quot; She replied with a confused look on her
face.

&quot;Right. Do you have a crush on Shiori?&quot;  Yuri looked shocked and a
little insulted.

&quot;No, Yuri just really likes her and she is helping Yuri with
something.&quot;

&quot;Oh, care to tell me what she is helping you with? Yuna thinks you
are going to leave her for Shiori.&quot; Ria said.

&quot;Yuri can&#39;t we promised to keep it secret until we were finished.
So Yuri is upsetting Yuna. Yuri knew it.&quot; With that Yuri ran off.

------------------------------------------------------------

Ria returned to the tree to wait for Yuna to get back from making
her call. Yuri had run off away from the school so it was up to
Ria to tell Yuna what had happened. She could see Yuna returning
from the main building looking frustrated.

&quot;Couldn&#39;t get through then?&quot; Ria said as Yuna got close enough to
hear her.

&quot;No it was engaged.&quot; She replied.

&quot;I have some news for you.&quot; Ria then explained about the
conversation she had had with Yuri. Yuna seemed relieved and then
told Ria about her conversation with Shiori.

&quot;So where is she now?&quot; Yuna cried

&quot;I have no idea, she just ran off towards town.&quot; Ria replied. They
decided that they should go look for her starting with all the
places that sold food. They then tried calling all the other
frauleins in case she had gone to one of them. They considered
doing a door-to-door search, but decided instead to just call
Misaki at the Galaxy Police HQ, to see if she had heard anything.
Lastly they went back to search the school grounds, but she wasn&#39;t
there either.

&quot;You don&#39;t think she got destroyed do you?&quot; Yuna asked a bit
panicky

&quot;Don&#39;t be silly, even one of the most powerful evils in the galaxy
failed to destroy her. I don&#39;t think we have anything around here
that could even scratch her.&quot; Ria said trying to comfort her upset
friend.

------------------------------------------------------------

Yuna couldn&#39;t sleep that night. She just kept thinking how empty
and lonely the house was without Yuri there. Especially how lonely
and cold the bed felt without her in it.

------------------------------------------------------------

The next morning Yuri rushed to her phone to call Princess Mirage
and tell her not to fire the cannon today, but found out Ria had
told her already and she was very sorry about Yuri going missing.
Mirage couldn&#39;t find her with all her radar and surveillance
equipment either.

Yuna slowly got ready for school and left a little too early for
the bus. She ended up standing in the cold air for over half an
hour.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;ACHOO&quot; The whole class turned to look at Yuna.

&quot;Yuna... are... you... ok? Maybe... you... should... go... to...
the... nurses... office.&quot; Shiori called up to her. Yuna picked up
her things and left the classroom.  She didn&#39;t go to the nurse&#39;s
office; instead she went to the roof.

&quot;YURI&quot; she shouted as loud as she could from the roof. She then
broke down into tears and curled up on the roof.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about Yuri if I were you she is quite safe.&quot;
Yuna looked up to see who was talking. It was a tiny robot fairy
thing. It looked like a very small mech suit.

&quot;Elner just where have you been all this time?&quot; Yuna said angrily
&quot;Do you know where Yuri is?&quot;

&quot;Yes I do, she will come back to you when she is ready. So there
is no point worrying about her. The person she is with would never
hurt her.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Elner that&#39;s a relief. Who is she with?&quot;

&quot;I am not at liberty to tell you, just go home and get some rest I
am sure she will be back in a day or two.&quot; Yuna got up tidied
herself up and walked home.

------------------------------------------------------------

When she arrived home she still couldn&#39;t believe how empty the
place felt. She sat down at the kitchen counter with her head in
her arms.  She stayed like that for the next hour and then there
was a knock on the door. Yuna jumped up and ran to the front door.

&quot;Oh hi Ria. I thought you were Yuri.&quot; Yuna looked disappointed.

&quot;Still not back then. I came round to keep you company if that&#39;s
okay with you?&quot; Ria replied.

&quot;Sure come on in, I could really use someone to talk to right
now.&quot; Ria entered and went to sit down in the living room. They
chatted for hours, watched a few movies and played some card
games, which Yuna lost every time. &#39;I guess you can&#39;t teach
someone so pure to play poker.&#39; Ria thought to herself.

------------------------------------------------------------

The next few days progressed pretty much the same. Some more of
Yuna&#39;s friends came around to comfort her. Ria stayed the entire
time just so Yuna wouldn&#39;t feel quite so alone in her home. 

Then on Saturday night someone knocked on the door again. Yuna
slowly walked to the door and opened it.

&quot;YURI&quot; Yuna screamed in delight as she glomped her friend. &quot;Where
have you been?&quot;

&quot;Yuri went to finish her research with Miss Shiori. Yuri didn&#39;t
want to come back until she had finished. Can you forgive Yuri?&quot;
Yuna just smiled at her and hugged her again.

&quot;Of course I can forgive you.&quot; They then went into the living room
and sat down on the sofa. Ria coming out of the kitchen saw Yuri
was back and decided to let them have some time alone and went
back into the kitchen.

&quot;So what were you researching with Shiori that was so important?&quot;
Yuna finally asked.

&quot;Well Miss Shiori said she could find out about Yuri&#39;s past, where
she came from and who built her.&quot; Yuri replied.

&quot;Oh. What did you find out?&quot;

&quot;Well, according to all the data Miss Shiori could find. Miss
Shiori&#39;s ancestors built Yuri 217 years ago. Originally Yuri was
meant to be a maid for the family. After 30 years of being a maid
times became more turbulent and the family redesigned Yuri so she
could be a powerful bodyguard for their children. These times came
to pass and Yuri was no longer needed so they sealed her powers
away and put her back to being a maid. This was about 100 years
ago. About 12 years ago they decided their daughter needed a
playmate since she refused to do anything quickly no one would
play with her. So they took Yuri and reprogrammed her so she could
be a playmate and guardian for their little girl.  This meant
unlocking all of Yuri&#39;s powers. Then a few years later they were
on a shuttle when it crashed into the moon. They survived the
crash, but they couldn&#39;t find Yuri anywhere. This really upset
their daughter for a long time. The next thing you already know
about, it was when Yuna found Yuri.&quot;

Yuna sat there slightly stunned at what Yuri had just told her.

&quot;So you were the Jinguuji families personal guard and maid for
over 200 years. How could they build something like you all that
time ago and you are still far more advanced than other robots?&quot;
Yuna looked really puzzled.

&quot;Yuri doesn&#39;t know. All the plans for Yuri have been destroyed as
far as Miss Shiori can tell.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s probably a good thing Yuri. I am glad there is only one of
you and that I found you.&quot; Yuna said smiling at Yuri.

------------------------------------------------------------

Meanwhile in the kitchen Ria had contacted Princess Mirage to tell
her that Yuri had returned. Princess Mirage set all her sensors on
the ship to pick up what was going on in the living room of Yuna&#39;s
house.

&quot;Isn&#39;t that an invasion of privacy Princess?&quot; Ria said dryly.

&quot;Yes, but I have to make sure they are all right, after all she is
the &#39;Savior of light&#39;.&quot;

&quot;I suppose so.&quot;

Princess Mirage listened in on the entire conversation and was
quite pleased at how well everything was going.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;So you thought Yuri was in love with Miss Shiori?&quot; Yuri exclaimed
with a surprised look on her face. Yuna looked slightly guilty at
this comment.

&quot;Yes, it was the way you kept staring at her and you stopped
eating whenever she was around. It seemed so out of character for
you.&quot; Yuri blushed slightly and giggled.

&quot;Yeah Yuri thinks that is actually part of Yuri&#39;s programming,
since they needed a playmate for Miss Shiori, they made it so Yuri
couldn&#39;t eat while Miss Shiori was around.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that makes sense. So you really don&#39;t love Shiori?&quot; Yuna
asked sounding hopeful.

&quot;No, there is only one person Yuri loves.&quot; Yuri then jumped on
Yuna and gave her a long kiss before jumping up again. Yuna lay
there looking stunned and blushing furiously. &#39;So she knew all the
time how I felt about her and she feels the same way too.&#39; She
thought &#39;Maybe I should stop hiding it from everyone, although I&#39;m
sure Ria and several others know how I felt about Yuri anyway.&#39;

&quot;Yuri, um... do you officially want to be my girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Yuri thought she already was.&quot; Yuri stood there looking extremely
puzzled, but amazingly cute. Yuna laughed a little.

&quot;I love you Yuri.&quot; Yuna said as she grabbed the confused girl and
held her tight. &quot;You have to promise not to scare me like that
again though.&quot;

&quot;Yuri promises.&quot; Yuri said as they fell into another long
passionate kiss.

------------------------------------------------------------

Princess Mirage stared at the monitor with a very happy expression
on her face.

&quot;Finally she can be honest with herself and they do make such a
cute couple.&quot; She then relayed the news onto Ria who was equally
satisfied that they were now a couple.

&quot;Took their time didn&#39;t they.&quot;

&quot;Eeeep, oh Elner it&#39;s just you.&quot; Said a relieved Ria.

&quot;Think we should tell the others?&quot; She asked

&quot;I think we can leave it up to those two to tell them, I can&#39;t see
either of them keeping it a secret.&quot; With that they decided to
leave by the backdoor and let the two girls have a night to
themselves.

------------------------------------------------------------

The next few days were like a dream for both of them. They finally
spent some time doing more date like activities. Like going to the
movies and cuddling in the back row, going for long walks, eating
at romantic restaurants, going dancing, and shooting things
together at the arcade (although Yuri won these games which
annoyed Yuna).

They just got back from an evening out at a karaoke bar when they
found a cake sitting on the kitchen table. On it was written
&quot;Congratulations Y &amp; Y&quot; They then walked into the living room to
be greeted by all the other Frauleins.

&quot;CONGRATULATIONS&quot; They all shouted at once nearly knocking Yuna
and Yuri over with the sound wave that followed.

&quot;So have you done the dirty yet?&quot; Mami whispered to Yuna. She was
promptly kicked away by Ria.

&quot;Stop being so crude.&quot; Yuna giggled at the two of them.

&quot;I... hope... you... two... will... be... very... happy...
together.&quot; Shiori said as she handed them a little present.
&quot;It&#39;s... a... present... for... Yuri.  She... can... install...
to... upgrade... her... self... repair... functions.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Shiori.&quot; Yuna said as she took the present &quot;Thankyou for
helping Yuri find out about her past too.

&quot;That&#39;s... okay.&quot; Shiori then walked off to find something to
drink.

The party continued on till the early hours of the morning, then
one by one the guests left to go back to their respective ships,
homes, etc. 

Once the last of the guests had left Yuna and Yuri retired to
their bedroom happy knowing that they will spend the rest of their
lives this way.
