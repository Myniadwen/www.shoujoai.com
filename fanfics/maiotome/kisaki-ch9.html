fanfiction by <a href="../authors/asinistre.html">Ange Sinistre</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maiotome/kisaki-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>AN: Preliminary note - The character &#39;Ann&#39; is the woman in Otome known 
as Ein/Ahn/misc. As she has no set spelling for her name, I picked one. 
She&#39;s Shizuru and Haruka&#39;s onee-sama. This is also the last chapter in 
the current arc. An interlude about Alyssa, set from her view point, 
will follow.

&quot;Headmistress is Garderobe&#39;s supreme military and administrative rank, 
reserved for graduates who have scored exceptionally high on all 
required tactical exams and performed impeccably on field missions. A 
headmistress must take on many roles: strategist and soldier during 
times of war, diplomat in times of peace, and as an instructor within 
the facility itself. Never think of the headmistress as a leader who 
sits and does paperwork. She is warrior at heart, and nothing must 
separate her from that mindset.&quot; - Garderobe Student Manual.

Natsuki and Akira stood side by side outside of the former Imperial 
palace of Kyoto, where Dammerung was housed, and watched as a gunmetal 
shuttled touched down in the small grassy field a few hundred meters 
away. Young Arika, who&#39;d been actively fighting the HiME for the last 
few hours, was finally allowed a reprieve and was inside the 
headquarters resting. She deserved it. The Emulator was now once again 
online thanks to the technical prowess of several specialists, and the 
Iolites had finally formed a solid line of defense and prevented further 
advances by the enemy. With the incoming reinforcements, perhaps they 
could finally recover their lost personnel now that the chaos had 
subsided. No thanks to Ashura.

Haruka was at the vanguard of an Otome force twenty soldiers strong, not 
including herself. Many recent graduates who were skilled but had not 
landed a contract, or various others who&#39;d been released temporarily 
from their duties, were following behind with awed glances as they 
examined Earth and it&#39;s ruination. Shiho Huit was there along with Akane 
Soir, Yukariko Steinburg, Carla Bellini, Laura Bianchi, Rosalie Claudel, 
Chie and her Delta Force, Ann Lu &#150; a multitude of big names. The world 
around them was silent for now, but who knew when the cannon fire and 
battles would return?

Haruka looked oddly upset, more so than Natsuki would have expected. She 
had been sent on an errand, yes, but she couldn&#39;t have been that upset 
about it. Something wasn&#39;t quite right. Haruka ceased walking a few 
paces in front of Natsuki, her golden hair whipping back and forth in 
the wind. Natsuki&#39;s brow was low and her face serious. &quot;I have a feeling 
something didn&#39;t go well.&quot;

&quot;Everyone reported in quickly. Getting the girls and heading back to 
Earth wasn&#39;t a problem.&quot; Haruka&#39;s voice was biting back anger and she 
seemed ready to explode at any moment. &quot;We got a message a little bit 
after takeoff, though, when it was too late to turn around.&quot;

&quot;And that message was?&quot;

&quot;The HiME who had been initially captured &#150; the ones I fought with &#150; 
were broken out. Lots of people at Windbloom Castle were injured. Many 
were killed.&quot; Haruka was purposefully giving her bits at a time, and 
this annoyed Natsuki greatly.

&quot;Did the HiME send another strike team to Earl to break the original out 
of prison?&quot;

&quot;It seems so. Two had avoided capture originally &#150; an Heir and one of 
the Twelve. The HiME then sent in another member of the Twelve to assist 
in a rescue mission. They had one extra guest, though.&quot;

&quot;Finish the entire story without the dramatic breaks, Armitage.&quot;

Haruka&#39;s lips curled into a snarl and her fists tightened at her side. 
The rage she was holding back finally freed itself, her controlled voice 
becoming an almost shrieking yell. &quot;Shizuru Viola is a traitor!&quot;

Natsuki was frozen in place at such a comment, and her eyes widened in 
disbelief. What? No, Shizuru would never, ever betray Garderobe. No, 
that wasn&#39;t the whole truth. She would, except for one thing. Natsuki 
was commanding officer of Garderobe, and Shizuru would have never turned 
on her. Never. Natsuki defensively crossed her arms and refused to 
accept such an outlandish statement. &quot;Shizuru would not turn on 
Garderobe. She has been a member of Garderobe as long as you have, 
Haruka. That&#39;s half of her entire life. Accusing your superior of such 
things...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not accusing Viola of anything. I am reciting a fact. It is fact 
that Shizuru was working with members of the Twelve. There were eye 
witness accounts of her fighting bare-knuckle with members of 
Windbloom&#39;s defense force! She freed the enemy, who in turn murdered 
Windbloom soldiers,&quot; Haruka stubbornly stated. She hissed just a bit, 
her long time rivalry with the woman showing off. &quot;Never trust that 
bubuzuke onna. People who are that perfect are always hiding some inner 
monster, and--!&quot;

&quot;Be silent!&quot; Natsuki yelled, her own eyes lighting up with passion. 
Still in disbelief, she would not tolerate such language towards the 
Archmeister &#150; both on a professional and personal level. &quot;You are 
neither judge nor jury member, so don&#39;t damn well place the blame on 
anyone when you don&#39;t have all sides of the story.&quot;

The two were broken up by a woman who embodied serenity; a woman who had 
been Shizuru&#39;s mentor in earlier days. A milky white hand came between 
them and a tall body gracefully followed suit. Her face was calm as 
always, demonstrating a level of control only wielded by one other 
person. Ann Lu, the onee-sama of both Haruka and Shizuru during their 
Coral days.

&quot;Please do not argue amongst yourselves,&quot; Ann requested professionally. 
She turned briefly to her former room attendant. &quot;Haruka, she is right 
in that we need both sides of the story before placing blame on anyone. 
There could be a likely explanation for --&quot;

&quot;For attacking members of Windbloom&#39;s army?! Onee-sama, you can&#39;t be as 
delusional as Natsuki!&quot; Haruka took a step back and felt her eyebrow 
twitch in annoyance. Shizuru always had been Ann&#39;s favorite, hadn&#39;t she? 
Figures. Shizuru was charming. Charm was also a trait found in most 
spies, wasn&#39;t it?

&quot;That said, however,&quot; Ann quickly added, making sure her tone was just 
stern enough for Haruka to get the message that she could calm down, &quot;we 
should still follow all protocol involved with such situations. Until 
we&#39;re able to locate the Archmeister, however, we much concentrate on 
recovering the other captured diplomats and Otome.&quot;

&quot;As far as we know, they&#39;re being held in the HiME base just east of 
here. It&#39;s underground and in the hills,&quot; Natsuki informed, completely 
ignoring the previous argument. It would do no good to dwell on it. 
Arguing with Haruka was like hitting yourself in the head with a hammer. 
&quot;We&#39;ll adjust your GEMs so they link up with the Emulator here. Be 
warned, however, the Dammerung Otome aren&#39;t exactly... easy to cooperate 
with.&quot;

&quot;What was that, Kruger-san?&quot;

Natsuki turned around to see Ashura, flanked by the remaining Five 
Column members of Earth, exiting the building. She inwardly sighed. 
Great. So much for the already tense diplomatic relations. She felt that 
she was going to get an ear-full. It didn&#39;t matter. Ashura was a 
do-nothing leader, and Natsuki had a mission to accomplish. &quot;I&#39;m 
readying my team for an infiltration of the HiME headquarters. Please 
leave us in peace.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s quite amusing. We&#39;re also leaving to attack the HiME to the 
east,&quot; Ashura said blandly. Like Haruka, she was holding something back, 
as evident by her little smile. &quot;I don&#39;t think your operation will be 
necessary.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;Because, apparently, all of your personnel are working for the HiME as 
it is.&quot; Ashura grinned smugly. &quot;I just got word from a team of Iolites 
who were relaying a message from the HiME themselves. All your soldiers 
that were &#39;captured&#39; had natural HiME birthmarks and can apparently 
manifest their own weapons. Tokiha-san, Nao-san, and Minagi-san 
included. They apparently went with the HiME peacefully. Did you neglect 
to tell me this little fact earlier, my dear headmistress? There are 
people with HiME blood on Earl, after all. It would not surprise me if 
these soldiers of yours were waiting for a chance to join with their 
kin.&quot;

&quot;That is utter bullshit and you know it. Stop trying to spin the 
information in a way that shames my people,&quot; Natsuki warned. She didn&#39;t 
quite understand the business of HiME marks and such things, so she 
inquired further. &quot;I don&#39;t know what a HiME mark is, so enlighten me. I 
can assure you that no one in my group would willingly change sides.&quot;

&quot;A HiME mark is a natural birthmark that forms on people with HiME 
blood. They show up when Heirs use their diadem devices. They appear 
permanently on the elite. Which your loyal people seem to be!&quot; Ashura 
said in her usual audacious tone. &quot;You are not to leave the premises. 
The Columns and I will be handling combat operations for the time being. 
Your reinforcements will be evaluated by my medical staff to check for 
any more HiME surprises.&quot;

&quot;Ashura, I am not your subordinate. I have my own mission to conduct and 
I&#39;ll be damned if I let you take over,&quot; Natsuki countered, raising her 
voice.

&quot;A shame, because I&#39;m the only one who knows were your &#39;captured&#39; former 
teammates are heading. So feel free to storm the HiME base and get 
yourselves killed. They aren&#39;t there.&quot; The anti-gravity function in robe 
began to activate, her ankles and wrists glowing as stabilizers hardened 
for anticipated flight. Ashura rose into the air with the other Columns. 
&quot;Have a nice day, Kruger-san.&quot;

The foreign Five Columns took off at top speed and headed away from 
them. Soon they were twinkling objects in the sky, and were then lost 
all together as they kept below the danger altitudes. Natsuki&#39;s nails 
were digging into her palms, and her blue coat twirled as she pivoted 
around roughly. She let out a frustrated growl. Ashura knew where they 
were, but wasn&#39;t going to say? The stuck up little whore! Perhaps if she 
took off right now she could try to follow.

&quot;What an ass,&quot; Chie commented after a moment. &quot;I can see why you needed 
more support.&quot;

Natsuki turned back around to face them. &quot;She&#39;s standing in the way of 
any and all progress on the part of Garderobe. She&#39;s less concerned with 
the benefit of all Otome and more concerned with her own personal gain. 
Needless to say, I&#39;m canceling the deals I&#39;ve made with her thusfar 
thanks to her lack of cooperation. Rosalie, go track them down and 
report back on what their position is. Don&#39;t fly too high under any 
circumstances.&quot;

Rosalie, who had been one of Natsuki&#39;s room attendants a few years back, 
materialized her robe after Natsuki allowed her permission in the 
absence of her regular master. Her trademark whip Element in her hands, 
the blond girl took to the air and gave her former onee-sama a salute. 
&quot;Not a problem!&quot;

They watched as the veteran meister raced off, and Natsuki gave the 
others temporary orders. &quot;The rest of you may examine the area, but 
don&#39;t wander far. HiME troops are close and we&#39;ll be moving out soon.&quot;

They did so, most going to examine the Dammerung building a short 
distance away from Natsuki, marveling at it&#39;s ancient construction and 
modern refurbishment. The exception was Shiho, who sat on the ground 
mumbling something about Ashura being a dickhead which was shortly 
followed up by a familiar chorus of maki maki maki! Natsuki rolled her 
eyes.

The headmistress was then approached by the other exception &#150; Ann. The 
tall, sandy haired woman gave her a soothing expression that reeked of 
compassion and understanding. So much like Shizuru. Natsuki shut her 
eyes for a moment. Shizuru. Could she really have made a legitimate 
defection? No. Never. Her eyes reopened and saw Ann placing a hand on 
her arm.

&quot;Walk with me, Natsuki.&quot; Ann then started to meander around the 
perimeter of the complex, and Natsuki was forced to keep up. 
Headmistress or not, this woman was still her upperclassman. &quot;Tell me 
what you&#39;re thinking.&quot;

Natsuki hated being analyzed, but Ann or Shizuru were exceptions as they 
were simply so skilled at bringing out inner emotions. &quot;Do you think 
your kohai is capable of betraying Garderobe?&quot;

&quot;Capable of betraying you.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t say that.&quot; Natsuki slipped into a defensive tone despite Ann&#39;s 
calming smile. &quot;Just answer the question, please. Mai, Shizuru... these 
aren&#39;t people who&#39;d just turn on Garderobe like that.&quot;

&quot;Shizuru is a very guarded young woman who hides away most of her 
emotions, but I imagine you already know that. You know Shizuru far 
better than I do, I&#39;m afraid. I adore the woman, and don&#39;t expect she 
would abandon the cause for any reason other than to settle down 
peacefully somewhere. This &#39;HiME&#39; group is unknown in our lands, so I 
highly doubt they have any motivation to join.&quot; Ann shrugged gently. 
&quot;But we all have our breaking points. Who&#39;s to say?&quot;

&quot;I suppose.&quot;

&quot;Regardless, we have to get the others back. Is Ashura going to stand in 
the way? What do you intend to do about her?&quot; Ann asked, the Annam woman 
brushing a lock of her hair behind an ear.

&quot;My loyalty is to Garderobe above all else,&quot; Natsuki stated. &quot;It&#39;s also 
to the Otome overall, and I feel that Ashura is a detriment to whatever 
it is she&#39;s trying to accomplish. She&#39;s been fighting this ground war 
for ages and has made no progress. I&#39;ve conversed briefly with soldiers 
and Iolites who fight for her. Morale isn&#39;t too high.&quot;

Ann lifted an eyebrow. &quot;Are you intending to do what I think you are?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s in the way and she causes more harm than good, onee-sama. 
Anything that stands in the way of progress, be the survival of the 
Otome or the recovery of our lost allies, needs to be removed at once. I 
suggest taking full control of Dammerung in her absence. She&#39;s foolishly 
left no one of any skill behind to prevent such a thing.&quot;

Ann paused and then sighed. &quot;Dangerous, but what would you have me do, 
Natsuki?&quot;

She looked briefly to the others and took into account all their skills 
and abilities. &quot;Make sure Ashura doesn&#39;t come back from her mission. 
Simply detain her, preferably. I&#39;m not entirely ruthless. With her 
failure, I&#39;ll use one of the emergency Otome rules and assume temporary 
control of Dammerung. With a couple victories over the HiME, I should be 
in their favor and we can actually get something done. Laura, Carla and 
Rosalie will all be skilled enough to help you. The rest should simply 
face off against the HiME. Make sure the other Column members don&#39;t see 
you do it.&quot;

&quot;As you request,&quot; Ann accepted. She frowned slightly, however. &quot;But 
please don&#39;t push yourself too hard, or lose grips with reality, 
Natsuki. I know Shizuru&#39;s absence is doing nothing for your thought 
process. She always did have that effect on you, did she not?&quot;

Natsuki glared just a bit, but wasn&#39;t truly offended. &quot;I&#39;m a capable 
tactician with or without Shizuru here. She&#39;s been abroad more times 
than I can count. I&#39;ll manage.&quot;

&quot;Their Five Columns are all five clicks to the northeast up one of the 
foothills. They&#39;re following a HiME group to a small cave. Looks like 
Mai and Nao are with them. The others must be... the Aswad leader and 
President Chrysant. I can tell by the clothing,&quot; Rosalie said over the 
GEM lines.

&quot;Good work, Rosalie,&quot; Natsuki replied. She held up her arm and got the 
attention of everyone else. &quot;All of you, move out and regroup with 
Rosalie. Your mission is to rescue President Chrysant, Midori al-Aswad, 
and any of our Otome with them. Understood?&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am!&quot; They took off and were sailing through the air in just 
moments.

Natsuki sighed and watched their retreating forms before turning around 
and facing the Dammerung building. Well, then. She had her own mission 
to accomplish. Prepare for Ashura&#39;s disappearance, and time the seizing 
of power. She&#39;d win over the Earth Otome &#150; of that she was certain. Some 
seemed to be fond of her already, despite her outburst in the control 
room, or perhaps because of that very passion and determination. She 
headed back in and saw a waiting Akira Okuzaki sitting beside Yumemiya&#39;s 
temporary cot.

The kunoichi eyed her curiously, and Natsuki passed by with a courteous 
nod. Nothing else was done. Natsuki was right to keep conversation to a 
minimum. Like Midori, Akira wasn&#39;t particularly fond of Otome, and 
worked with them only out of necessity. Akira couldn&#39;t help but feel 
like something was tense, however. Like something was about to blow up.

- - -

Sayer&#39;s Tomb, as it was called, was located in a remote cave a good long 
walk away. They didn&#39;t dare use the Children for transport. They needed 
to keep things quiet now that the Otome had their Emulator back online. 
The hike had been long and largely uphill. Mai could feel the burning in 
her legs as she marched in line between Mikoto and Midori. Yukino and 
Nao were behind them, members of the Twelve keeping them all in perfect 
marching order. Uneasy looks continued, the members of the Twelves all 
slightly afraid of losing their powers to these new foreign upstarts. 
Perhaps Minako&#39;s ranting had been correct. Perhaps they were special 
decoys just meant to steal the power away. Never trust an Otome.

When they entered the sacred place, Mai&#39;s nose was instantly filled with 
the scent of stagnant air that could only come from something very old. 
Like some long forsaken basement filled with cobwebs and dust. The tomb 
was dark, lit only by a few lanterns and torches. A grave marker that 
looked as if it had been hastily thrown together by a group of people 
who were not professionals in the funeral business. The name was etched 
on their as if carved in by a rock.

Katrin K. Sayers

born: 1 April 2000

died: 18 November 2021

XIII

&quot;So young,&quot; Mai muttered unintentionally. She knew nothing but their 
legend of Katrin, but even still, Mai couldn&#39;t help but feel pity. To 
have had a child kidnapped, a husband killed and a sister killed so 
young... it was appalling. Her insides wanted to weep and scream at the 
same time. XIII?

On the gravestone was a single handgun that was quite large and jet 
black in color. Mai leaned in and examined it. The parts were rusted and 
it had no ammunition &#150; probably why it hadn&#39;t been stolen unless there 
was some curse upon the tomb placed on anyone who dared disturb it. 
These people did seem rather superstitious after all. She could make out 
the western writing of &#39;Israel Military Industries&#39; on the side of it.

&quot;You brought us all the way out here to look at a rock with a name on 
it. I feel like my soul has just been reborn.&quot; Nao rolled her eyes and 
spoke with a great amount of sarcasm. &quot;Shall we fly to the other 
hemisphere and examine some trees now?&quot;

Medea shot her a glare. &quot;You were one of the people to give your life 
for this girl, you know. Show a bit of respect.&quot;

&quot;I did not give my life away for the sake of some punk twenty-one year 
old,&quot; Nao countered. &quot;I think you&#39;ve been smoking far too many happy 
herbs for a long time. What next? I was Napoleon in the life before that 
one? Please.&quot;

&quot;I see some things do not change,&quot; Medea sighed, recalling her visions 
of the Last Carnival. Such endless sarcasm.

Midori let her fingers trail across the gravestone, outlining each 
letter. &quot;It&#39;s a tragedy to lose someone in the prime of life. I agree 
with Mai. The woman has my sympathies. Odd. I don&#39;t usually mourn a 
death. I&#39;m used to it. Still, this story does happen to strike me where 
it hurts. I am not ashamed to admit that. What happened to her child?&quot;

&quot;He lived on and started a long line of heroes. Many of Katrin&#39;s 
descendants were active participants in the HiME-Otome Wars over the 
various years of fighting,&quot; Azumi answered. &quot;So her bloodline survived, 
even if she did not. At least something good came of it. The husband 
must have been buried elsewhere. We have no record of him.&quot;

&quot;Are the Last Ikusahime buried anywhere?&quot; Midori asked with morbid 
curiosity.

&quot;If they are, the sites have gone undiscovered. Why, do you wish to 
examine your own bones to see if they match up with the new form?&quot; Medea 
inquired in a rising, joking tone.

Midori smirked. She took another glance around the room, and then at the 
others one by one. Yukino, Nao, Mai, Mikoto... she couldn&#39;t help but 
wonder if Medea spoke the truth. She looked to the somewhat familiar, 
for some reason, looking gun on the grave, laden with dust. Everyone and 
everything felt far too comfortable. She was a lone wolf and never 
trusted outsiders, especially if they were Otome. So why did she feel 
such a connection to these people? Was it all fabricated because of the 
stories, and she was simply being conned? Or was it genuine.

&quot;Azumi!&quot; One of the Heirs was calling from outside.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;A ship came down over the ridge. Looks like Leucosia&#39;s back. She&#39;s 
heading this way. I can see Sharvari and the others with her. That 
Otome, too, and with some new girl who has a funky-ass hair cut.&quot;

&quot;Signal them and lead them over here. The Otome could stand to see this 
place too,&quot; Azumi stated. She turned back to the group already there. 
&quot;Well? Do you feel something stirring in your souls with all this talk 
of your original era?&quot;

&quot;I feel something stirring in my soul, but I think it&#39;s my lunch trying 
to escape this god awful soap opera of resurrection,&quot; Nao quipped, 
crossing her arms.

&quot;Azumi!&quot; Another shout. The Mistress of Yafusa sighed, irritated with 
the interruptions in addition to Nao&#39;s snarky behavior.

&quot;What now?&quot;

&quot;Um... problem.&quot;

&quot;Speak.&quot;

&quot;Five Columns are inbound. And there&#39;s a bunch more Zeta variants 
trailing them. We may be in trouble,&quot; the Heir informed. Azumi snapped 
into action.

The HiME sent orders out immediately. &quot;Heirs, make a defensive line here 
and don&#39;t let them through. Everyone materialize and engage immediately. 
Call Children only if necessary. No need to risk that just yet. Mai!&quot;

&quot;Y-yes?&quot;

&quot;Come out here and help us. You&#39;re filling in for Minako!&quot; No room for 
argument.

&quot;Ah, crap.&quot; She put a hand to her head and sighed. She couldn&#39;t very 
well harm one of the Otome, could she? She&#39;d be in major trouble even if 
they were only Dammerung soldiers. For that matter, she couldn&#39;t even 
fight! She&#39;d just learned to materialize, and even that had been an 
accident. Like her Otome powers or not, it was still new and foreign. 
She formed the Inferno Spirals and floated a mere foot in the air. And 
yet it feels so incredibly comfortable and far more powerful than the 
GEM ever did...

She flew out of the tomb and into the air just above the Twelve members. 
Indeed, the Earth Columns were inbound. Behind them were many more 
Otome, and Mai simply had to freeze. Were those... ah, shit! Those were 
Earl Otome, and faces she was very familiar with. Haruka was wearing a 
different robe, an Iolite one, but was no less recognizable. Haruka&#39;s 
onee-sama was nearby... Natsuki&#39;s room attendant and many more. How 
could she fight?! Surely there was a diplomatic way to solve this.

Ashura and the other Columns dove down to fight with the Twelve and the 
group clashed in a great display of energy and momentum. Ashura faced 
off against Azumi, the other four Columns selecting a member of the 
Twelve to duel with, the latter group trying to use their numbers to an 
advantage. It was the Earl Otome who stopped to stare at Mai, wondering 
how she could only be in her uniform as opposed to her robe. Something 
was definitely off. Mai held up her hands and flew forward just a bit.

&quot;This is a big misunderstanding! Please go back and tell Natsuki we&#39;re 
fine!&quot; Mai pleaded.

Ann furrowed her brows. &quot;How are you...?&quot;

&quot;A long story!&quot; Mai truthfully replied. &quot;Please leave, Ann. I don&#39;t want 
to see any more fighting between the factions right now. This is very 
sacred ground for them, so--&quot;

Their little conversation was interrupted by Heirs hurling throwing 
knives from down below. Ann was forced to dive out of the way, the 
others darting to the sides. Mai groaned in annoyance and waved from 
them to stop, but it did absolutely no good whatsoever. She watched as 
Azumi fired shots at Ashura, who rocketed through the air in order to 
dodge every one before diving back in and kicking the HiME roughly in 
the chest, hurling her back several feet thanks to the added momentum. 
Mai winced and felt guilty for letting it happen. A Column armed with 
sword gauntlets attacked the Kiyohime Mistress, who blocked each attack 
with her bright red bardiche.

A Child was summoned. A giant green spider lashed out with it&#39;s bladed 
tail and forced Earl and Earth Otome alike to scatter. Now the Garderobe 
soldiers were trying to counter, getting in gentle hits here and there 
against the Heirs and the forming beasts. A small, slender hydra that 
could only be a diminutive Kiyohime. A crippled wolf. All fired weapons 
and lashed out with what claws and teeth they had, Otome forced to 
scatter far and wide to avoid being hit. Chie and Shiho raced in from 
above to attack Kiyohime. Akane tried her luck with Julia.

It was growing chaos, and it only got worse when yet another group 
entered the mix. She could see Haruka stiffen and gather energy. Mai 
watched the blonde woman streak down to the ground at top speed while 
yelling out an accusatory, &quot;Bubuzuke onna!&quot;

- - -

Shizuru&#39;s back hit the ground and she felt a sharp pain in her stomach. 
She looked up to see Haruka dressed in a blue and white robe, armed with 
a metal Otome staff that was quite curiously sailing right for Shizuru&#39;s 
pretty little head. Funny, Shizuru thought, because surely she and 
Haruka had gotten over most of their aggressive rivalry in their school 
days. Was this because of that one unpaid bet? She held her hands up 
regardless and began to roll out of harm&#39;s way.

Haruka&#39;s loaned staff was caught by Tomoe&#39;s spear before any damage 
could be done, the green haired Windbloom native successfully pushing 
the other female back a bit. Haruka clenched her jaw and shoved back, 
the two in a power struggle. Metal scraped against metal and a screech 
was emitted from their clashing weapons as they slid against one 
another. But Haruka was, well, Haruka! Tomoe&#39;s strength, though 
impressive, was no match for the other woman&#39;s. She was forced to leap 
back and yield just a bit. Haruka rushing in and lashing out with her 
weapon.

Tomoe ducked and tried to elbow Haruka in the abdomen, but with a 
combination of the robe and Haruka&#39;s natural strength, it did little to 
harm her. Haruka smirked and grabbed hold of Tomoe&#39;s arm. &quot;Another 
traitor shows her face as well! What a lovely couple you make!&quot;

Natsuki knows. That was all Shizuru could think of.

Haruka twisted Tomoe&#39;s arm and manipulated her into a throw. The green 
haired convict hit the ground shoulder first. Shizuru looked up to see 
her former onee-same, Ann, land a few feet away. She promptly ducked 
under a stray ice bullet. Shizuru kept low for safety&#39;s sake, though the 
noise from those ice pistols was oddly soothing. This is becoming a true 
battle and not just a light skirmish, isn&#39;t it? There were so many 
bodies hurling themselves about and lashing out with weapons.

Tomoe stood back up and slid away from an incoming kick from Haruka. 
Shizuru fixed her gaze on Ann, who she always adored, and felt 
conflicted. &quot;Onee-sama?&quot;

&quot;Shizuru, I need you to come with me right now. This is extremely 
important. Can you materialize?&quot; Ann was pleading with her and holding 
out a hand, though a long double ended scythe was in the other. A 
powerful statement, Shizuru thought.

&quot;Get lost!&quot; Sharvari shouted from behind, and Shizuru watched as the 
Mistress of Maitreya leapt forward with that giant black claymore, 
slicing it down towards her onee-sama. Ann blocked it expertly, of 
course, but found herself locked in a duel with the HiME. Shizuru held 
her ground. She couldn&#39;t fight on that level without a robe.

She blinked then, as she saw something most unexpected. Tomoe slugged 
Haruka across the face. The blonde wouldn&#39;t be disoriented for long, so 
Tomoe grabbed Shizuru hand and began to drag her along towards the cave 
a short distance away where she had spotted Midori and Nao. Never before 
had Shizuru felt so... completely helpless. She saw Mai above wandering 
aimlessly, blocking shots on occasion with a fire shield. Yet she had no 
robe? Interesting. Mai dove down and tried to separate Haruka and Tomoe, 
but to no avail. Mai only found herself the target of various Otome who 
now considered her an enemy, apparently. Such confusion! She had 
certainly missed a lot during her little field trip. Leuocosia was 
trailing behind but left to link up with her elder sister, Medea, who 
welcomed her with a quick grin.

&quot;In here!&quot; Tomoe demanded, indicating the cave. Shizuru, still a bit 
pained, joined the ranks of Midori, Nao and the president while Tomoe 
raced back to prevent Haruka from closing in. Many of the Otome, it 
seemed were suddenly very fond of Shizuru. Several tried to get near, 
but were rebuffed by other HiME loyalists.

So the cave was temporarily safe, but she needed to get her act together 
if she wanted to survive. What could she do now? Shizuru turned to Nao 
and gave her an inquisitive glance. Nao shrugged. &quot;Hey, they took my GEM 
away, what do you want me to do about this?&quot;

Shizuru sighed. Midori pointed to a grave in the back. &quot;We got a gun 
with no ammo if you want to throw it at somebody.&quot;

Oh, that sounds productive. Never the less, Shizuru stumbled back to 
examine it. Maybe there was ammunition hidden away somewhere else in the 
area? No, not with her luck. She picked up the gun and was instantly 
frozen. Suddenly, she didn&#39;t hear the battle around her. She saw only 
the gun and was captivated by it. The giant Desert Eagle in her hands 
was heavy even though it was empty, and something in her burned.

Silence and blurred vision.

- - -

Memories that were not her own, or at least she thought. Dueling with 
five Otome in the streets of a Japanese city. Woken up at an ungodly 
hour. &#39;It&#39;s Christmas-time!&#39; No, it was dark out. It was most certainly 
not Christmas-time. A scene change. Natsuki was repairing a motorcycle 
(since when did she have a vehicle aside from the Garderobe official 
one?) while a young blonde woman looked on in wonder and perhaps pride. 
The blonde... such a similar facial structure as her girlfriend&#39;s. The 
same piercing eyes, though a different color. But Natsuki had no 
siblings. This was not...

The blonde was suddenly a few years older still and walking with Shizuru 
and Natsuki along a beach in some young land that was familiar and 
foreign at the same time. A young man walked arm in arm with the blonde. 
Natsuki was minding her tongue but none too happy about the younger 
blonde courting some man, as if she were protective of her in a sisterly 
fashion. But again, Natsuki was an only child. This made... no sense.

Shizuru holding a newborn and grinning like an idiot as Natsuki demanded 
the release of a nephew while Shizuru simply claimed that the biker 
would drop him like a European tea set. European tea set. There was rage 
in such a thought, and memories of a pond, but Shizuru did not know why. 
Her focus returned to the babe, who had a dark crop of hair from the 
father and what was sure to be the sky blue eyes of the mother. She was 
in another room resting from the effort while loving aunts, and a few 
other familiar faces, watched over the son. Midori, not as stoic as 
Viola remembered, decided that he would make a good red ranger with 
those looks. Whatever that meant.

The blonde mother on all fours in the middle of Shizuru&#39;s living room 
bawling her eyes out, tearing streaming down her face and gathering on 
the floor and she lamented the loss of something. Her words were hard to 
back out, as her body was convulsing and shaking. Searrs! Searrs was to 
blame! A quick glance to Natsuki, who retreated up stairs for just a 
brief moment before leaving the house with a pair of revolvers.

Shizuru stood among friends. Midori was to her left. Nao in front. 
Natsuki at her other side. Mai and Yukino, and Akane, and Mikoto. A 
total of twelve familiar faces. All were rushing forward with weapons in 
their hands. Shizuru uses a bulat steel bardiche to hack into some 
soldier that was clearly an enemy, and she felt her chest tight with 
anger and rage. Natsuki fired at and killed another, the rest of the 
group injuring or finishing off targets of their own.

One last look at the blonde woman as Natsuki, who was heavily wounded, 
returned a newborn into her arms, speaking words that Shizuru could not 
hear. Loving words. The tone was loving. Shizuru could hear that. 
Natsuki and Shizuru then retreated back to assist the other Ikusahime, 
who were still in battle. They had to leave now. There was no longer any 
reason to stay. The blonde was leaving to stow away the child somewhere 
safe, though she herself looked damned and determined to fight on her 
own terms.

A mighty metal wolf was amongst eleven other mechanical monsters, all 
forcibly summoned and now trapped and unable to be recalled. She herself 
was bound to something. The others were as well. Natsuki watched in 
horror as some man ordered the removal of one of the wolf&#39;s gun turrets. 
Suddenly, Shizuru and the wolf were howling in mutual pain, and she felt 
as if her entire arm had been hacked off and her shoulder crushed. 
Shizuru felt herself trying not to sob from the agony, but failed.

And then, there was green.

Saikyo Saiaku no Hime.

- - -

&quot;Viola!&quot; Midori was yelling. Shizuru was lost in a haze, the face of 
that blonde woman who was so dear to her, but in a very different way 
than Natsuki was, sticking in her mind and almost haunting her. Midori 
rustled behind, her feet sliding on the rocks as she scurried about, 
dodging an incoming attack from one of the Earth Columns who wielded a 
staff. Midori had no weapons and no power. She shot forward and landed a 
punch, but it hit the girl&#39;s shoulder and did not accomplish anything.

Shizuru turned around, slow and zombie like, and watched apathetically. 
Something had... been ripped from her. Her eyes did widen slightly as 
Midori, in her fear, brought a long labrys into existence, the weapon 
born from either imagination or some internal materialization power that 
Shizuru was not aware Midori had. Midori herself stared at the weapon in 
awe, as did the attacker.

There was a scream of, &quot;My Element!&quot; from somewhere else in the battle. 
The speaker sounded rightfully distressed.

Midori kicked the Column back and swung out with her weapon, catching 
her in the side. The Column fell, but more Otome were attracted to that 
like piranha attracted to fresh blood. Shizuru saw Rosalie and some 
other Earth Column attack, stepping foot into the tomb. Shizuru felt 
incredibly protective at this intrusion. They were... not supposed to be 
here! This was not their place! This was... this was a resting place for 
someone so incredibly dear to her.

Kuga Alyssa. That was the name. Not that damned alias on the stone. How 
did she know that? It did not matter.

Shizuru stood and took a step forward. Another. She watched as Midori 
smacked a Column in the knee with the shaft of her newfound weapon, and 
watched as Rosalie countered by kicking Midori in the stomach. No, this 
would not do. There was to be no fighting here. This place was too 
special for that. This place was to be quiet and peaceful. Shizuru fixed 
her gaze on the Otome, even Rosalie, with her infamous blood red eyes 
now absent emotion and replaced by some haunting gaze that felt so 
horrible to her. Like reliving a nightmare she could not wake from!

- - -

Ann Lu was always calm and reserved. It was her calling card. Now, 
however, she was extremely worried and perhaps a bit frightened. She had 
never seen Shizuru with that look on her face. She had seen her upset 
many times, yes, but that was not the expression. It was dead. She 
looked as if someone had ripped out her soul. Shizuru was walking 
forward oh so calmly, if with a bit of a drunken or fatigued swagger, as 
if she could not see the raging battle around her. Ann blocked another 
saber attack from an Heir and batted her away. Ann kept her eyes on 
Shizuru incessantly, barely noticing the arrival of a few Iolites who 
came in to back up their superiors.

Shizuru paused at the edge of the hillside, staring out at the horizon &#150; 
not at the HiME or the Otome or anything around her. Her eyes were 
glazed over, but they still managed to roll around enough to take in her 
surroundings. Then, in a harsh second, Shizuru had held out her arm and 
the slender hydra beast that Natasha, the member of the Twelve, had 
summoned earlier vanished.

&quot;Kiyohime?&quot; She heard someone ask, and spotted the woman looking around 
in confusion. After all, that Mistress of Kiyohime had been using the 
Child for years on end. That had never happened. Ann was tempted to prey 
on that confusion, and would have had she not been so worried about 
Shizuru.

&quot;We lost another one! Who has it now?!&quot; Azumi shouted out over the 
battle, trying to talk to Medea in particular as she was the one with 
all the knowledge. Medea did not hear, too busy fighting with one of the 
Earl Otome. It was bow versus bow, Yukariko and Medea facing off against 
each other in a ranged duel. Funny, the weapons largely looked the same.

There was a glow from Shizuru, and Ann&#39;s gaze fixed on her young student 
with worry. There was a glowing symbol shining through her garments just 
below her left breast. Another flash and Shizuru hoisted the Krov 
Bardiche that belonged to the Mistress of Kiyohime up over her head, 
resting it diagonally for just a moment. Several stopped to gaze at her, 
acknowledging that she was one of the &#39;Ikusahime.&#39; Mai was frozen in the 
air, and her jaw was practically on the ground several hundred feet 
below. Ann shared the sentiment. What in god&#39;s name was that? Shizuru 
had no GEM to use.

&quot;Back.&quot; Shizruru said it once and only once. When the Otome did not 
comply, she swung her weapon forward. Like her infamous double-katana, 
the blade segmented into a thousand different parts and acted as a 
chain. One of those poor Iolites... Ann watched as a leg was separated 
from her body. The Iolite girl dropped to the ground a great distance 
below, screaming the whole trip down. The chain whip crashed into the 
hill on it&#39;s return trip and kicked up rock and dirt, polluting the air 
and getting everyone&#39;s attention.

Azumi stopped firing her guns.

Ashura stopped herself mid-attack to avoid red chain as Shizuru 
retracted it.

Ann was frozen in place.

Yafusa, the lumbering giant wolf, howled forlornly and ceased his 
attacks.

Shizuru leveled her gaze on the Otome leader, Ashura, who readied 
herself for battle. Her sword was held high and the leader was moments 
away from charging in at full speed. Shizuru was almost baiting her to 
do so. At last, Ashura struck with lighting speed. Even with that, 
Shizuru gracefully slid out of harm&#39;s way with a dead, patronizing 
laugh. &quot;Ara, ara... such a pitiful mockery!&quot;

Ann was stunned at how haunted that voice was. It only got worse. Her 
next words were mystic and frightening in their delivery.

&quot;Kiyohime,&quot; Shizuru said huskily. The hydra from moments earlier 
returned, but twice as large and far more bulkier than the diminutive 
little Child that had been there before. Shizuru then turned to the wolf 
with a mad look of determination. &quot;Duran!&quot;

She only held technical power over one, but both of the Children stormed 
forward at Ashura. One limped. The other darted forward like a king 
cobra striking out at prey. The Column leader was rightfully frightened 
at the power Shizuru held over both Children to get them to move so 
quickly. She started to dart into the air to escape but her leg was 
caught by one of Kiyohime&#39;s heads. Fangs sank into her flesh and Ashura 
screamed in absolute pain.

At least, until Duran violently and mercilessly sank his own teeth into 
her upper body. The two Children fought and pulled like mutts fighting 
over a scrap tossed from the dinner table. One good pull from the pair 
of them and Ashura, the Spiritual Quartz, was no more. Ann glanced down 
at her room attendant and she could swear that Shizuru was chuckling. 
Kiyohime attacked again, but this time she was going for one of the Earl 
Otome who strayed to close. Carla dove out of the way and shot into the 
sky away from harm.

Ann dropped to the ground and ran at her former room attendant, holding 
up a hand. &quot;Shizuru, stop it!&quot;

&quot;Get back, onee-sama!&quot;

&quot;Haruka, stop it!&quot;

Before Tomoe could stop her, Haruka had rushed forward and hit Shizuru 
with the Iolite Otome staff, getting her right in the gut. She expected 
Shizuru to double over in pain, and lit her face up for such a thing. 
Haruka quickly frowned, however, upon realizing that Shizuru simply 
hadn&#39;t moved at all &#150; as if the staff hadn&#39;t ever touched her. The next 
thing Haruka knew, she was treated to her own medicine. The bladeless 
end of Shizuru&#39;s mighty red bardiche slammed into Haruka&#39;s side and sent 
her flying. The blonde landed against the ground roughly, but managed to 
stand after the fact, hobbling up and turning back around in shock.

&quot;Shizuru!&quot; Ann cried. That had been a deliberate attack against another 
Otome! In self defense for Haruka, but for Ashura and the Iolite... 
&quot;Shizuru!&quot;

Shizuru lashed out with her chain again, and the red whip raced through 
the air and was met by Laura&#39;s energy field, which was formed at the 
last second. The chain was suitably blocked, but that was yet another 
attack against a fellow Otome. A deliberate one. Shizuru was showing 
more and more signs of not being true to Garderobe. An actual defection. 
Ann shook her head. The darling, graceful girl she had mentored... this 
could not be how it would end.

The Otome were retreating, and rightfully so. One by one they sped away, 
leaving behind only the HiME. No one had been rescued. Haruka hadn&#39;t 
even visually spotted a cowering Yukino during the entire conflict. The 
president was left behind. The HiME stared at Ann, who had tears in her 
eyes. No one dared to attack her, which was a surprise, and Shizuru 
fixed a hollow gaze on her. She took a tentative step forward. Shizuru 
did not react. Another step. So far so good. At least Shizuru seemed to 
tolerate her presence. Ann held up her hand again and gave her a caring 
gaze to make sure that it was well known that Ann still cared.

&quot;Shizuru...&quot;

&quot;Onee-sama.&quot; Hollow.

&quot;You can&#39;t return to Dammerung now.&quot; Statement of fact. Ann shook her 
head. &quot;You&#39;ll... Natsuki will have to... Shizuru, you attacked your 
fellow Otome! You killed two of the Earth Otome! Shizuru-chan, you 
aren&#39;t going to survive a trial by the world council. This could be met 
with execution! Please, because I love you, don&#39;t come back.&quot;

&quot;Yes, onee-sama.&quot; Mindless obedience.

&quot;Don&#39;t come back. Not even for Natsuki.&quot; That was met by silence, and 
rather angry silence. Ann took to the air and vanished from sight, 
heading back to Dammerung and leaving before the other HiME could finish 
her off. It was a miracle they&#39;d let her speak to Shizuru at all judging 
from that fight.

Shizuru gently began to turn and stagged back towards the tomb. Tomoe 
approached and even she wouldn&#39;t dare try to get too close. &quot;Shizuru, 
onee-sama? Look at me.&quot;

&quot;Go away.&quot; She looked up towards the tomb entrance, where Nao, Midori 
and Yukino still stood. Her voice became commanding. &quot;You too. Go away. 
Do not enter this place. Go back to where you came from.&quot;

The trio scattered without question and joined the ranks of the 
Earth-born HiME. Azumi wasn&#39;t sure what to make of all of this. Shizuru 
entered the tomb and knelt in front of the gravestone, the bardiche 
embedded and resting in the dirt. Azumi looked to the others, who 
shrugged. Many backed away. Medea seemed intent on going home, not 
liking the woman&#39;s reaction to gaining her powers. Medea offered one 
excuse. &quot;She needs time. This action was taken before. Time.&quot; Whatever 
that was supposed to mean.

So, the Earth-born HiME turned and left. It was the resurrected 
Ikusahime who stayed firmly in place alongside Tomoe, who stood outside 
the cave looking like a dog told to wait outside by an owner. Mai turned 
to Midori, who still held her new Element &#150; that red tinted labrys. 
&quot;What do we do now?&quot;

&quot;Now?&quot; Midori looked down at her weapon. &quot;Now I fight the Otome on equal 
footing. I never cared for them and likely never will. A natural hatred 
for the Otome, you might say. They&#39;ve been in power for too long on 
either planet and they&#39;ve done barbaric things in the past. Those 
distorted visions of ours? Mine are clearing. I&#39;m not going back.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not?&quot; Mai asked.

Midori shook her head. Her labrys was soon in the air. &quot;No way in hell. 
They scream of injustice and dishonor. They&#39;re artificial imitations of 
what we were. Start believing in Medea, Mai, because she&#39;s absolutely 
right. I see it. All of it. You, Nao, everyone. It&#39;s our job as 
Ikusahime to protect humanity and the world. We obviously have to put a 
stop to this nonsense. So we have to stick together now. Don&#39;t you feel 
it? That desire to right what&#39;s wrong? To ensure justice is preserved?&quot;

&quot;Now she&#39;s lost her mind,&quot; Nao said with a shake of her head.

&quot;Make the pact, Yuuki, or the rope comes back!&quot; Midori spat out, and she 
hardly believe those were her own words. She was never that passionate. 
Yuuki? Nao too, was a bit stunned, but offered her hand almost 
instantly. Midori&#39;s was soon on top of it. Mai stared at it for a 
moment, and hesitantly offered hers as well. Yukino followed suit. 
Neither really knew why. It was just right.

Mikoto was last, still hung up on her indoctrination in ages past. 
But... if Mai was willing. &quot;I&#39;m only doing it so I can protect Mai. It&#39;s 
my job. I don&#39;t care about either side. It&#39;s only for Mai.&quot;

Mikoto&#39;s hand was on the pile, and they broke. Five of them! What a 
magical number! Mai then pointed inside the cavern. &quot;What about her?&quot;

&quot;Ah... broody, beautiful white ranger,&quot; Midori offered in a joking 
manner. &quot;Let&#39;s go further down and give her some space. We&#39;ll wait for 
her there. Tomoe, come on.&quot;

The green haired Windbloom maiden did not move at first, her eyes filled 
with worry and concern. She took one step into the tomb to try and get 
Shizuru to listen to reason. That, however, was a mistake. Tomoe was not 
one of the Ikusahime and in Shizuru&#39;s present state, those were the only 
people she would have been able to tolerate in the tomb of her lover&#39;s 
darling younger sister. Shizuru&#39;s eyes snapped around and violently 
glared at Tomoe, who nearly broke down at the hate filling those 
beautiful eyes. Tomoe turned and ran after the others. If Shizuru needed 
space, then she would wait as long as necessary.

- - -

Again... it happened again.

Shizuru was not sure how many minutes or hours had passed, but she was 
no longer calmly sitting in front of the grave with that dull 
expression. She&#39;d come out of that dark abyss and once again faced her 
own rage. Why, god, did she have to be so damned violent and harbor such 
fury? She was... supposed to be calm! She was Shizuru Viola! That was 
her most well known trait! She slammed a fist on the ground, her eyes 
welling with tears. Her breathing was heavy and pained.

Natsuki&#39;s gun. It was Natsuki&#39;s gun, wasn&#39;t it?! It was few feet away, 
but Shizuru drew it up in one hand and clutched it tightly. A relic from 
her previous life. The other hand gripped onto the gravestone and 
brushed against the rock. Alyssa... was buried there. That young and 
beautiful woman! To die at twenty! That poor soul hadn&#39;t even been given 
a chance to live as a normal person. So much stripped from her, and for 
no reason at all! No, Shizuru knew why. So those precious Otome could be 
developed.

It was Shizuru&#39;s eternal attachment to the only people she could 
consider &#39;family&#39; that drove her to such madness. Natsuki scorned her, 
and she slaughtered. Alyssa was stolen from her, and now just look at 
it! A lifetime later and she was bound to the same insanity! She&#39;d 
journeyed back into that realm she swore never cross into again! A 
pained cry. What was wrong with her? Was this an affliction of her very 
being that she could never shed no matter how many lives she led? Doomed 
to be a homicidal lunatic. She needed Natsuki to hold her right then.

Ah, but yes! Natsuki, the Headmistress of Garderobe, would no doubt be 
forced to give orders for Shizuru&#39;s imprisonment or execution after what 
she&#39;d just done! Natsuki... She probably didn&#39;t even believe in or trust 
Shizuru anymore. One word from Ann, and Natsuki would know that Shizuru 
was lost beyond hope. Ann.. she had let down her onee-sama as well.

A thousand worries, but only one took precedence. She had failed to save 
Natsuki during those hazy final days. Failed to protect Alyssa. Failed 
to survive the battle. Failed, failed, failed! Shizuru shed tears in 
silence for several minutes before one sob escaped her throat.

A pale, leather clad hand rested on her shoulder. The voice that spoke 
was calm and devoid of that zing which defined a living being. &quot;Please 
do not weep, Fujino-san. It has long since been over.&quot;

- - -

End arc one. Alyssa&#39;s interlude coming next, followed by Natsuki and 
Shizuru beating the piss out of each other! Longer chapter, I apologize. 
Also apologize for quality of writing, as it&#39;s 4:15 AM and I finished 
this all in one sitting. :D</pre>
