&quot;They ruled the world for eight thousand years. They were born as 
dictators who sacrificed their people without hesitation, all for their 
selfish desires. So powerful and conceited were the Ikusahime that they 
rose up and crushed the ancient Obsidian Lord who governed them. It was 
then that they began to kill our sisters one by one. It is our duty to 
never let such murder happen again. Together, we can unite and protect 
the people of a Golden era. Find your courage and guard it well. For the 
sake of the world, young maidens, we must overthrow the princesses of 
old.&quot; -- Archmeister Inoue Sakura, circa 2793.

One day later, Shizuru descended from the foothills.

Her companions had been waiting below, and when they saw her, they saw 
an entirely different woman. She retained the same grace and dignity in 
her strides, but there was something in her eyes that betrayed a great 
deal of change. Gone was the occasionally arrogant and flippant attitude 
of the Archmeister. It was replaced by depth, maturity, and the pain 
from a lifetime of traumatic events. She looked almost regal, and in 
many ways like a fearsome war goddess coming down from the heavens.

Midori could not help but wonder if they all looked a little different. 
The rest of the group had been waiting below for hours, and during that 
time they had attempted to sort through their long buried memories. 
Perhaps they were all carrying themselves a bit differently. Midori felt 
a wellspring of energy and vitality within, something she had not felt 
since she was a little girl, ignorant to the plight faced by the members 
of Aswad. Mai had become somewhat withdrawn &#150; less bubbly. Nao&#39;s eyes 
were darker and more hostile. There was a fighting spirit there now. 
Though most of their memories were hazy and locked away, it could not be 
denied that something within them was waking up. Something was stirring 
inside.

It was Tomoe who was the first to approach Shizuru, jogging a few paces 
up the thin dirt path that led up to Alyssa&#39;s resting place. She was 
timid in her approach. &quot;Shizuru onee-sama? Are you all right?&quot;

Shizuru was silent for a lengthy moment, her gaze piercing into Tomoe, 
her body rigid and still. When she finally did speak, it was calm and 
the Kyoto accent was slightly stronger than it was before. &quot;I am very 
much alive and well, Tomoe-san. Do not worry.&quot;

&quot;How much do your remember, Shizuru?&quot; Mai inquired. She shook her head. 
&quot;It&#39;s all still very vague to me. I can remember all your faces, and I 
can feel surges of different emotions with each one, but nothing in 
great detail.&quot;

&quot;Like trying to remember what happened on a night of heavy drinking?&quot; 
Nao offered with a slight smirk. The quip was, to her dismay, responded 
to with dead silence. She sat and sat back against a tree, giving up.

Shizuru continued to move forward and down the path. When she moved by 
Yukino, she saw the young president flinch and tense up. She had never 
done that to Viola before. Not to Viola, no. Shizuru&#39;s gaze fell 
slightly. &quot;I remember a great deal, Mai-san. I remember far too much.&quot;

Yukino faced the distorted memories of a murderous Shizuru and nearly 
found herself ready to foolishly attack the woman in a fit of ancient 
rage. Those red eyes stopped her, and Yukino calmed enough to remember 
forgiveness and understanding, and the sacrifices they had all made 
together after their battle royale had ended long ago. In a heartbeat, 
she had both condemned and absolved Shizuru of her past sins for a 
second time.

They were again thrown off when another figure descended down the path. 
She was all too familiar to several of them. Tall, platinum haired, and 
leather clad. It was Miyu, that enigmatic warrior who usually popped up 
for endgames and had protected Arika during her younger days. Yukino 
pointed at her. &quot;Miyu! How did you get here?&quot;

&quot;The same way I got to Earl centuries ago,&quot; Miyu said coolly. She tilted 
her head to the side. &quot;I was a stowaway. You really must be more 
cautious when making trips to and from Earth.&quot;

Midori clutched her weapons, not knowing what to do. &quot;What do you want?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s here to help us fight the Otome,&quot; Shizuru explained, holding out 
an arm to calm the group down. &quot;Do you remember Miyu from our days in 
the Last Carnival? This is not a copy. This is her, alive and well after 
all these years.&quot;

&quot;So you remember everything about us?&quot; Mai asked.

Miyu nodded. &quot;I have only used eighty percent of my memory storage 
devices. I have retained all events that have occurred since my creation 
and upgrade. You are looking well, Tokiha-san.&quot;

&quot;T-thank you?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going to fight with the Otome?&quot; Yukino asked. &quot;But didn&#39;t you 
help them?&quot;

&quot;One of my priorities is to destroy Otome, either the GEM or it&#39;s 
wearer. I only assisted you in your battles because your enemies were a 
greater threat at the time, especially to Ojou-sama&#39;s descendants,&quot; Miyu 
explained. &quot;I was re-programmed, quite specifically, to combat Otome, 
and have been doing so since their inception.&quot;

Silence fell over the group. It seemed as if most were happy enough to 
let Miyu tag along, but they didn&#39;t know what their next plan of action 
should be.

&quot;What do we do now?&quot; Mai asked. She knew she was supposed to hold some 
kind of leadership position, but she had long since shied away from 
fighting during this lifetime. She knew she did not yet have a hold on 
her natural Ikusahime powers, and because that, she felt insecure. There 
would be hours of practice ahead, if she could manage it.

&quot;For my entire life,&quot; Midori said in a low, almost threatening tone, &quot;I 
have hated Otome. At first, it was because they held so much power over 
and entire planet and condemned my people to disease. Now I think I 
truly understand all that rage and anger. It&#39;s not simply because of 
Garderobe. It&#39;s a long standing fury thanks to what happened to us. Now 
that we can see that again, it&#39;s our duty to stand up against the Otome 
here and on Earl. They should have never been brought into existence.&quot;

Nao chuckled dryly. &quot;Oh? And what makes you think that all twelve of 
&#39;us&#39; will turn against the very organization that raised us and molded 
us into adults?&quot; There was a twisted little grin on her face. &quot;I have a 
feeling this is going to be messy. Don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all a matter of effort,&quot; Midori countered. Her eyes darted to Nao, 
Yukino and Mikoto. &quot;First things first &#150; you three have to learn to 
materialize your Elements and Children. We need everyone in fighting 
shape before we try anything at all aga--&quot;

Shizuru continued down the path, Tomoe just behind her, and showed no 
signs of stopping. Mai called out after her. &quot;Hey, where are you going?&quot;

The elder female turned around for just a moment. &quot;I am going back to 
the HiME stronghold to inform them of what my intentions are. Then, I am 
going to pay a visit to Natsuki.&quot;

The rest paused, knowing that absolutely no good would come of that. 
There was sinking feeling in the bottom of their guts. Shizuru did not 
wait around long enough for an argument. She and Tomoe continued down 
the path and off towards where they had come from in the first place. 
Knowing that Shizuru should not be alone when venturing right back into 
the heart of the Otome territories after what had happened, everyone 
soon followed. Most were going to support her. Nao was going to see 
whether or not there would be a cat fight.

- - -

&quot;As the commander of Garderobe&#39;s forces and as the leader of the Five 
Columns on my world, I am issuing a state of emergency and assuming 
control of Dammerung after the death of the Spiritual Quartz.&quot;

Natsuki made the announcement with a stern gaze, and the Dammerung 
soldiers in the assembly hall were staring at her in awe and what 
appeared to be blind devotion. Without Ashura, they were lost and 
confused, and Natsuki preyed upon that weakness. Now, she knew, she 
could finally get something done without having Ashura to butt heads 
with. It was well within her rights to assume power in such a situation. 
Ashura had no replacement of her own. The heir she had named had died 
months ago. If Natsuki had not taken power for herself, they would have 
degenerated into petty bickering over who would be the new leader.

The Iolite troops and the civilian workers were easily impressed by the 
young headmistress of Garderobe. It was only the Earth-born Columns who 
seemed uncomfortable with the change, and that was only because most of 
them wanted the position for themselves. They would be made loyal soon 
enough. A show of force in the battlefield would accomplish that. They 
needed confidence in Natsuki&#39;s abilities as a warrior. That was all the 
Dammerung Otome seemed to care about when it came to who was in charge.

In all those times when Ashura had denied her authorization to go out 
and command her soldiers, Natsuki had been reading into the Dammerung 
archives. There was not one moment when she had wasted time sitting 
around the Otome headquarters. She knew just what to say to get her new 
army to follow her.

&quot;I am holder of one of the original five GEMs. It was with this GEM, the 
Ice Silver Crystal, that killed the first and greatest of the HiME 
leaders. It is with that same power that I will crush the HiME and allow 
Dammerung to once again protect the nations of Earth and lead the world 
back into a new age of prosperity!&quot; There was a united shout of praise 
that followed.

Mashiro blan de Windbloom stood behind and to the left of the 
headmistress. She was in no way comfortable with what was happening, for 
reasons she did not fully understand. The same was true for Akira, who 
was on Natsuki&#39;s opposing side. This was a dangerous action on Natsuki&#39;s 
part. She was now responsible for the safety of both Dammerung and 
Garderobe, and would be liable should something negative happen to 
either. With Earl trying to disarm the Otome as it was, this was likely 
to been seen as a violation of the treaty signed by the twelve nations. 
Unless Natsuki played her cards right. It was, after all, a state of 
emergency. Treaties and protocol went out the window in such times.

&quot;Together we will ensure the peace and safety of the citizen of both the 
Sol and Lalande systems!&quot; Another shout of praise followed.

The address ended within a few short minutes. Natsuki had never been one 
for public speaking. When all had cleared out, and after she had 
returned to the command center, the other Columns approached her. They 
were still hesitant to give their trust to the young leader.

&quot;Our first goal,&quot; Natsuki said once they were in private, &quot;is to recover 
the missing Earl diplomats before my world gets an itchy trigger finger. 
A few elite soldiers should be enough. The HiME seem to be skilled at 
fighting against large numbers and a regular army.&quot;

Megumi, the fourth Column and the holder of the Immovable Bloodstone, 
gave her a somewhat sarcastic response that was an invitation for an 
argument. &quot;And what do we do with the Otome from your world who have 
HiME blood in them?&quot;

&quot;They won&#39;t attack you if I&#39;m present.&quot;

&quot;That red-eyed demon woman butchered good friends of mine when soldiers 
from your world were present on the battlefield. Forgive me if I don&#39;t 
think the presence of an ally will stop them from attacking,&quot; the fourth 
Column retorted. Natsuki resisted the urge to slap her.

&quot;You will not attack them unless you&#39;re attacked first. Do you 
understand me?&quot; Natsuki calmly said back, forcing back her anger at such 
a statement.

Megumi only grunted in response, but it was enough for now. It would 
improve after the first fight. It would take a little bit of time and 
effort to make sure they were broken of Ashura&#39;s habits. The Columns 
were then dismissed, leaving Natsuki with what could be considered and 
equally negative group. Mashiro and Akira had been staring at her since 
the address, and it was then that they finally had the chance to speak.

&quot;I trust your judgment, headmistress, but don&#39;t you think this is a 
little risky? This isn&#39;t our world to command,&quot; Mashiro said.

&quot;I don&#39;t think this will go over well with the other nations,&quot; Akira 
pointed out.

Natsuki waved her hand in dismissal. &quot;It had to be done. Rescuing the 
people who have been captured is our priority. There&#39;ll be war on Earl 
if one of them were to die in the field, both between them and Garderobe 
and between the nations themselves. This is an emergency, and I&#39;m making 
use of emergency powers. It&#39;s fully legal.&quot;

&quot;Still, don&#39;t you think...&quot; Mashiro again began to protest.

&quot;If there was an efficient alternative, I would have taken it,&quot; Natsuki 
interrupted. &quot;This is the only way. I&#39;m going to get a team together to 
go see if I can&#39;t clear some more territory and give the Otome some 
breathing room. We lost too much when the Emulator was down. I want you 
two to wait here. Arika and Chie&#39;s team will stay behind to guard the 
palace.&quot;

Akira gritted her teeth. She was so utterly sick of being told to &#39;wait 
here.&#39; The daimyo of the region was an intolerable old fool and she no 
longer desired to strike up a diplomatic talk with him. She was a 
warrior, and was growing restless. Too much waiting and she&#39;d start to 
snap. Akira was brave, of course, but was perhaps too bold with her next 
question. &quot;What&#39;s going to happen to Archmeister Viola?&quot;

Angry green eyes were then fixed on Akira, and the kunoichi instantly 
regretted asking such a thing. &quot;That&#39;s my concern, not yours.&quot;

&quot;The punishment for attacking another Otome in such a fashion warrants 
imprisonment or execution,&quot; a sweet voice came from behind them. Natsuki 
turned to see Ann, who was already fixing her gaze on the headmistress. 
&quot;This, of course, has to be ordered by whomever is in charge of 
Garderobe. That is Otome protocol.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll cross that bridge when we get there, Ann,&quot; Natsuki said, her 
voice indicating that any further discussion would be a very bad idea. 
She could tell that Ann, despite her own love for Shizuru, was forcing 
Natsuki to face the possibilities and wondering if she really could go 
through with it.

&quot;Ara, I suppose we will.&quot;

Natsuki frowned. &quot;We need to get moving. The sooner we reclaim lost 
territory and the sooner we can get the diplomats back from the HiME, 
the better off we&#39;ll be.&quot;

- - -

As the Ikusahime et al marched back towards the HiME base to the south, 
they were entertained by the wonderful vocal stylings of Midori 
al-Aswad. It was her intention to make the hike as entertaining as 
possible, and silence was not acceptable during the course of the long 
walk through the forest. For those who could only remember the stern and 
calculating leader of the desert warriors, it was unnerving. For those 
who remembered Sugiura? Well, it wasn&#39;t unexpected. Nao covered her ears 
with her hands and groaned. Why was she always around this lunatic at 
times like this?

&quot;Oh, the aim of our patrol is a question rather droll! For to march and 
drill, over field and hill, is a military goal!&quot; Midori sang, 
practically goose stepping in time with the song.

&quot;Isn&#39;t... that from a cartoon?&quot; Mai asked, though it was nearly drowned 
out.

&quot;By the ranks or single file, over every jungle mile...!&quot;

&quot;Ara, this was the one with the elephants.&quot; Shizuru lifted up her arm 
like a trunk and imitated the sound of one of the long extinct beasts.

&quot;Oh, we stamp and crush, through the underbrush, in a military style!&quot; 
There was supposed to be an echo fro the rest of the troop at that point 
in the song. It was not performed. Midori turned her head around to 
glare daggers at the rest of them. A katana was partially unsheathed.

All but Nao then shouted, &quot;In a military style!&quot;

A continued glare. Nao glared back. The katana was entirely removed from 
it&#39;s sheath. Nao shook her head. &quot;Nao-san!&quot;

&quot;No!&quot;

&quot;Do it!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re such an overgrown five year old. The first thing you remember 
about your past life is a cartoon song instead of how to fight like a 
HiME!&quot; Nao argued, and as they walked she prepared herself for a fight. 
In all honesty, she didn&#39;t know why she was bickering with the Aswad 
leader. She&#39;d barely ever talked to the woman before. This whole 
resurrection thing was indeed creepy.

&quot;That&#39;s not true! The first song I remembered was the theme to Sharivan! 
...It&#39;s catchy!&quot;

&quot;Oh, for god sakes.&quot;

&quot;Sing, Nao-san!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know where we are anymore,&quot; Nao said as an excuse.

&quot;Then I&#39;ll have to start from the top, then, won&#39;t I?&quot; Midori said with 
an evil little grin. &quot;Hup, two, three, four, keep it up, two, three, 
four!&quot;

The rest of the group groaned loudly. Mai and Tomoe smacked Nao on the 
backside of the young woman&#39;s head. How had she not seen that coming 
from a mile away? And so, the song began yet again. Tomoe didn&#39;t have 
the memories of the movie from which the song originated, but even she 
had caught on to the lyrics by then, and sang along for safety&#39;s sake 
even though she wanted to run her spear through Midori&#39;s head.

&quot;...is a question rather droll! For to march and drill over field and 
hill, is a military goal! Nao-san, god dammit!&quot;

&quot;Is a military goal!&quot; Nao finally shouted back.

&quot;Ara, Midori always wins, doesn&#39;t she?&quot; Shizuru, despite the hellish 
memories she&#39;d recovered, still managed to laugh. Yukino hung her head 
and tried her best to ignore it, simply too unused to the stoic leader 
of Aswad behaving in such a manner. Miyu, in an uncharacteristic display 
of humanity, could only roll her artificial eyes.

- - -

When they made it to the HiME base, they found Minako up and about. The 
traditional Japanese lady paused at the entrance and gave them a 
respectful bow, which they returned. The last traces of bickering 
vanished between Nao and Midori as they stood before the now powerless 
leader of the Twelve, not sure whether she would welcome them or turn 
them away. Of all the HiME, it was Minako who was hardest to judge. Her 
expression was usually that of a poker face. Her eleven companions stood 
around her, all dressed in their formal kimonos.

&quot;We&#39;ve decided,&quot; Midori spoke for the group, &quot;that we&#39;d be willing to 
put an end to the Otome. Shizuru, Mai and myself have reacquired our old 
powers and several memories from our past life. Medea was right in that 
we&#39;re the Ikusahime reborn. It won&#39;t take long before we remember 
everything.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Minako replied curtly. She fixed her gaze on the two newcomers. 
&quot;And who are they?&quot;

Mai pointed to Tomoe. &quot;This is a former student at Garderobe. She has no 
further ties with the Otome and has been assisting us since her 
arrival.&quot; She then pointed to Miyu. &quot;This is Miyu. I do believe she was 
the guardian of your beloved Ojou-sama.&quot;

Well, that certainly got everyone&#39;s attention. HiME and their soldiers 
wandered over to gaze at the combat android, who began to feel 
incredibly uncomfortable with the attention. Miyu took a step back. &quot;She 
speaks the truth. I am guardian to Ojou-sama&#39;s descendants and am 
programmed to help annihilate the Otome. I have been on Earl for the 
last several centuries.&quot;

&quot;Why did you abandon us?&quot; Minako asked after a moment of awed silence.

&quot;My top priority is to protect those who share the blood of the 
Ojou-sama. Those with the purest blood went to Earl. I followed.&quot;

Minako paused for just a moment. Many of the HiME heroes of old had been 
related to Alyssa in some way or another. There was still very strong 
admiration for anyone who shared those genes. &quot;Is her bloodline still 
intact? Do descendants still exists out in the colonies? Her last 
relatives here were slain several decades ago.&quot;

&quot;There is an Otome who is a descendant of Alyssa. Another is Alyssa&#39;s 
resurrected sister. I will not harm either of them, but I will slay the 
rest if necessary.&quot; Miyu&#39;s words were as cold as ice. Most people leaned 
in, wondering just who could be a descendant of such a legendary figure. 
Shizuru, especially, stood at attention. This was her family, after all.

&quot;Who is her descendant?&quot; Even Minako&#39;s eyes finally lit up with some 
emotion.

&quot;Arika Yumemiya.&quot; Silence.

A very loud and disappointed groan from many of the Earl natives. Nao 
wasn&#39;t sure whether to laugh at the irony or cry at the revealed fact. 
The noise that escaped her throat was half-chuckle, half-sob. &quot;No. No 
way. Absolutely not. That isn&#39;t possible. Alyssa was one of those super 
intelligent creepy kids. Arika&#39;s... well... Arika was dropped on her 
head several times as an infant and it shows. They can&#39;t be related!&quot;

&quot;Are you insulting a descendant of the Ojou-sama?&quot; Miyu asked. She held 
up an arm, one instant away from extending her sword. Nao recognized the 
thread and wisely took a step back, shaking her head.

&quot;Well, Rena kicked ass,&quot; Mai said. &quot;I can believe it from that, I 
suppose.&quot;

Minako clapped both her hands twice and forced everyone to focus once 
more. &quot;That&#39;s enough. Regarding the situation at hand, I am forced to 
admit that you are indeed the resurrected Ikusahime. However, with every 
reawakening, my team loses some power. The Mistresses of Kiyohime, 
Gakutenou and myself are now forced to use Diadem devices to materialize 
basic Elements. You can see how dangerous it would be for one of the 
Ikusahime to wake when my allies are in a fight.&quot;

&quot;I understand, but it&#39;s hard to control. In a crisis, it almost happens 
automatically,&quot; Midori explained diplomatically. &quot;It&#39;s a natural 
instinct for us. We are compelled to materialize weapons in a life or 
death situation.&quot;

&quot;I know there is no way to prevent it. That is why the Twelve are 
willing to lay down their Elements and Children for you. Which among you 
have yet to materialize your Elements?&quot; Mikoto, Nao and Yukino held up 
their hands. She nodded, and then turned to Medea, who was standing 
against the wall. &quot;Well, which Ikusahime are they, seer of seers?&quot;

Medea inclined her head to two other kimono clad members of the Twelve 
who in the room, two dressed in green and the other in black. &quot;The 
Mistresses of Diana, Julia and Miroku.&quot;

&quot;Are you willing to accept your powers once again?&quot; Minako asked. Yukino 
gently nodded, feeling as if it was the right thing to do. Mikoto, more 
torn between her upbringing and her destiny, took a bit longer to 
decided. After looking at Mai, however, she knew there was only one 
choice to make. There was only one choice that was proper.

The three current holders of the Children walked forward, their pace 
deliberately slow. They did not want to give their powers up, but in the 
face of the legendary Ikusahime, they had no alternative. It would be 
wrong to hold them back. The first to surrender their abilities was Mei 
Lin, the Mistress of Miroku and a veteran warrior from the HiME sept in 
eastern China. She knelt before Mikoto and materialized the dark 
obsidian blade in her hands. She offered it to the petite woman. Mikoto 
daintily picked up the mighty sword and held it close. The HiME mark on 
her arm began to glow brightly, welcoming the powers, as Mei Lin&#39;s mark 
forever faded out of view.

The next was the Mistress of Diana, who went through a similar ritual. 
Instead of summoning the great collection of mirrors that were her 
Elements, she called upon her Child. Diana, in her giant and plantlike 
form, appeared before Yukino and quietly let out several low sounds that 
could have been likened to purrs. Yukino was afraid of the beast at 
first, but felt a rush of warmth as she reached out her hand and rested 
it on Diana&#39;s body. She remembered. Her HiME mark began to glow before 
returning to normal.

Finishing it off was the Mistress of Julia, who was the least happy of 
the bunch. The gauntlets materialized over her hands and she slid them 
off, practically tossing them at Nao, who sneered. Nao looked down at 
them for a moment and place them over her own hands. They felt 
comfortable and familiar. She focused on them as if they were her Otome 
Element, and they vanished from view. She looked up in time to see 
Julia, who, like Diana, only remained in view long enough for the users 
to lay fresh eyes on them once again. A giant spider was her Child. She 
grinned. How terribly fitting.

&quot;What of the other Ikusahime?&quot; Minako asked to Medea.

&quot;Many of them are Otome,&quot; Medea said. She fixed her gaze upon Midori and 
Shizuru. &quot;It will be your task to bring them back to the proper side 
before it is too late. I am sure that once they see you as HiME, buried 
memories will once again start to stir.&quot;

&quot;I am leaving to go speak to one right now,&quot; Shizuru stated, not willing 
to hear any other opinion from her peers. &quot;The sister of your Ojou-sama 
and the leader of Garderobe.&quot;

&quot;Then you must be escorted. Walking into Otome territory is suicide if 
you&#39;re alone. You have attacked them and they will think you a traitor,&quot; 
Minako warned.

&quot;So be it.&quot;

&quot;But we are going with you,&quot; Mai said, taking a step forward. &quot;Whether 
you like it or not, kaichou-sama.&quot;

Shizuru nodded once. If they wished to go, that was their own decision. 
She could order them to stay behind if necessary, but they had every 
right to go with her. She would not stand in their way. Her gaze drifted 
towards the exit of the tunnels. Natsuki would listen to her, wouldn&#39;t 
she? The way they were raised in this lifetime be damned. Natsuki should 
have been in tune with her enough to feel some sort of connection and 
realize what she was. Or so she prayed.

Midori spoke next, and showed that she was still very capable of being a 
mature and intelligent leader by making her question very worthwhile. 
&quot;Where&#39;s their Emulator? If we destroy it completely, will that leave 
them helpless for good?&quot;

&quot;There are several Otome Emulators around the world to handle the 
massive amount of users. If you destroy the one here, we can take Kyoto 
within a few days. Their Emulator is stored deep within Dammerung,&quot; 
Minako explained. &quot;The area where you and I set off the EMP. Perhaps 
it&#39;s because Kyoto is sacred, but they use one of the first Emulators 
ever made. It still has a human core.&quot;

&quot;Like the one at Garderobe,&quot; Midori stated. She furrowed her brows. &quot;Do 
new Emulators not use a human core?&quot;

&quot;No. With the newest technology, it is unnecessary. New Emulators, and 
all of ours, do not use human cores. They, sometimes like ourselves, are 
occasionally bound to old traditions when it comes to ancient ground 
like Kyoto or Fuuka.&quot;

&quot;How old is this ancient Emulator you speak of?&quot; Shizuru&#39;s gaze 
darkened.

&quot;I do not know. Some time between the twenty-first and twenty-seventh 
centuries, so the rumor states.&quot; Minako turned to Miyu. &quot;Do you know?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

Minako shrugged and then held out a box of belongings. &quot;These are the 
items we took from you when you were held prisoner here. They are yours 
to reclaim, if you so desire. I apologize for reacting negatively to 
your reawakening. I am still a tactical leader here. If you need the 
cooperation of the Heir forces, simply contact me.&quot;

Shizuru bowed her head and took the box from her, opening it to find 
basic weapons and the captured GEMs. Each of the former Otome took back 
their jeweled earring and tucked it away for safe keeping, not knowing 
what exactly they were going to do with the devices now that they were 
unnecessary. Any conversation ended when Shizuru turned and walked 
towards the exit. The members of the Twelve watched them depart, the 
rest of the group close on Shizuru&#39;s heels. The Mistress of Kiyohime 
found herself looking at Yukino for a moment. &quot;Kikukawa-san?&quot;

It took Yukino a moment to realize that that was her. &quot;Y-yes?&quot;

&quot;We may need your assistance.&quot;

- - -

Haruka was at the vanguard of an Otome group heading out to both try and 
reclaim some territory and to hopefully search for the missing diplomats 
and Column members. She was forced to use an Iolite GEM as the Topaz was 
useless without Yukino to complete the contract. It was a horrible 
little robe, not unlike those used by Pearl students at Garderobe. 
Terribly underpowered and incapable of allowing her to maximize her 
potential strength. She felt like a cripple, but it was better than 
nothing.

Ann Lu and Rosalie were to her left. Shiho and Arika were on her right. 
Behind was the rest of the Earl Otome, and Natsuki was among them to 
personally command the group. With her organizational skills and 
assistance, they&#39;d already taken back three entire blocks of Kyoto. 
Machine gun nests had been blasted away with Natsuki&#39;s artillery, and 
infantry had been taken care of by the rest.

But now, it was deathly silent. Where there had been swarms of HiME 
Heirs, there were now empty streets. Where there had been snipers, there 
were now abandoned windows. It looked like a ghost town. Snow was 
falling and carpeting the broken and cracked streets with fine white 
flakes. Haruka did not like it one little bit. It was not just the 
block. The entire city looked as if it had been evacuated. Had the HiME 
given up such sacred ground? No, that wouldn&#39;t make sense. Not with 
their fanaticism.

&quot;Keep focused,&quot; Natsuki warned. Her cannon was in her hands and just 
waiting to be put to use. &quot;This is most certainly a trap.&quot;

Ann was searching windows, expecting a sniper to pop up at any moment. 
There was nothing. Then, finally, her eyes spotted movement. It was not 
a person, but rather the skyline. It was there for only a fraction of a 
second, but she could have sworn that she saw the air distort as if it 
were a sunny and incredibly hot day. How could there be heat waves in 
the middle of winter? &quot;Did you see that?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; She heard Akane ask.

&quot;The air rippled.&quot;

Most turned around to look at her as if she were insane, but Natsuki 
kept her gaze forward. The work of a Slave or Child? Ann was an 
incredibly skilled and observant Otome. If she had need to mention it, 
then it was something to pay attention to. Her own eyes then saw the 
distortion, and she stopped walking. &quot;Everyone, split up and get to the 
edge of the street for cover.&quot;

They dispersed and awaited further commands. Natsuki had her cannon 
pointed down the street. Some illusion? A cloaking device? How far had 
technology come to allow such things? Like a sharpshooter, she remained 
frozen and absolutely focused on what was in front of her. As the 
snowflakes continued to fall to the ground, she dropped her jaw as she 
saw someone simply blink into existence as they walked through a 
rippling segment of the world in front of them.

&quot;Mai!&quot; Natsuki called.

The redhead stood in the middle of the street. Her face was almost 
mournful in the way that she was looking at the group. Something about 
her seemed so utterly different. She took several paces forward, saying 
nothing. Though she was a friend, Natsuki kept her gun trained on her in 
the event that those rumors of defection had been true.

&quot;Mai, are you all right?&quot; Natsuki asked. &quot;Where are the others?&quot;

&quot;Where they can see you,&quot; Mai said simply. Natsuki darted her gaze 
around, but saw no one. Mai continued on, trying to sound friendly and 
maternal. &quot;We need you to disengage your robes and remove your GEMs. 
Please, Natsuki. We don&#39;t want to fight. We need you to understand 
what&#39;s going on.&quot;

&quot;I am not surrendering our weapons, Mai. Tell the others to come out 
from wherever they&#39;re hiding at once. This is not a game.&quot; Natsuki 
tightened the grip on her rifle, though she had no intention of using 
it.

There was another ripple in the world in front of them, and from the 
rift emerged the rest. Nao and Midori stood on the side of ruined 
buildings, waiting to jump down at a moment&#39;s notice. Yukino was on a 
rooftop. Shizuru and Mikoto appeared beside Mai. Had it been anyone 
else, Natsuki would have immediately thought that it was an ambush. She 
was not willing to believe that her own comrades would betray her, but 
there was a sinking feeling in her stomach.

&quot;Kruger! The Otome are abominations of man and were never meant to be in 
this world or on any other!&quot; Midori shouted from above. &quot;We need you to 
surrender your GEMs to us now. Dammerung and Garderobe both need to 
disband, or we&#39;ll have to force you out of power.&quot;

&quot;Are you out of your mind?!&quot; Haruka yelled. She formed the Iolite 
quarterstaff in her hands as a precaution. &quot;Was that a threat, desert 
rat?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Midori said sternly.

Two more people appeared. Miyu came to rest against an opposing building 
and, of all people, Tomoe Marguerite walked forward to stand by her 
beloved onee-sama. Natsuki tightened her jaw. What was that criminal 
doing here? She did not like the close proximity between her and 
Shizuru. Not one bit. There were few people Natsuki put trust in. If she 
could rely on anyone to tell her the truth, it was her love.

&quot;Shizuru, explain what&#39;s going on,&quot; Natsuki demanded.

The brunette walked forward with an unreadable expression. She only 
crossed a distance of a few paces before coming to a stop again. 
&quot;Natsuki, we are Ikusahime. There are twelve of us with HiME blood in 
our systems. Over a thousand years ago, we saved the world and were then 
summarily killed by the organization who created the Otome. This 
lifetime is our second chance to finish our quest to rid the world of 
something that should have never been made. Please understand me, 
Natsuki.&quot;

Natsuki shook her head. &quot;You sound like you&#39;ve been brainwashed, 
Shizuru. Nao! Do you have your wits about you enough to make sense of 
any of this?&quot;

&quot;My wits are as sharp as my claws, headmistress,&quot; Nao commented with a 
smirk. In Nao&#39;s hazy memories, she had only started to remember the very 
bad things that had happened between them. Respect and admiration were 
now replaced by bitterness and rage. &quot;I would be very happy to test 
those very claws out on your to make sure they&#39;re still in working 
condition.&quot;

&quot;Zhang, what the hell is wrong with you?&quot; Rosalie barked.

&quot;Or maybe I should just slice out your eye, as you have always so 
desperately deserved!&quot; Nao was practically in a fighting stance already, 
and some of the others on her side were giving her heated glares that 
expressed their discontent over Nao&#39;s behavior. She was ruining their 
chances of resolving this peacefully!

Natsuki was taken aback by the fury in Nao&#39;s voice. What on earth 
happened to her? They&#39;d all become so different from their usual selves. 
She and Nao bickered, but there had always been some level of respect 
between them. Natsuki was certain that the Twelve had managed to somehow 
brainwash the lot of them. The fact that it had happened so quickly and 
effectively was frightening. Perhaps she had thought too lightly of the 
HiME. They were clearly not to be underestimated if they could turn her 
elite soldiers into such mindless drones.

&quot;Natsuki.&quot; A sweet and familiar voice gathered her attention once again. 
She looked up to find Shizuru&#39;s warm eyes staring at her with an 
intimidating amount of depth behind them. &quot;We&#39;ve not been brainwashed. 
We simply remember days that you&#39;ve long forgotten &#150; a lifetime that we 
left behind long ago. Many of you are HiME and do not realize it. Akane, 
Shiho... even you, Natsuki.&quot;

&quot;Since when do you believe in resurrection on that kind of scale?&quot; 
Natsuki asked with a huff. &quot;Don&#39;t speak to me about such outlandish 
ideas. They&#39;ve forced you to believe something that can&#39;t possibly be 
real. Shizuru, you are the Archmeister of Garderobe. You cannot possibly 
turn your back on the Otome. If it wasn&#39;t for the, you would still be 
living on the streets.&quot;

There was a slight twitch in Shizuru&#39;s eyes. Perhaps that hit too close 
to home? Shizuru&#39;s voice became a bit more desperate.

&quot;Natsuki, that cannon you&#39;re using once belonged to your Child! Do you 
not remember anything at all? Does none of this sound remotely familiar 
to you? You cannot forget Duran. They mutilated your Child right in 
front of you and shot every single one of us in order to acquire our 
spirits so that they might use our life forces to better the Otome. 
Don&#39;t you remember those last moments when I held your hand. Don&#39;t you 
remember Alyssa trying in vain to--&quot;

&quot;Remember who?&quot; Natsuki hissed.

Shizuru instantly tensed up and found herself frozen with temporary fear 
as most of the others looked on in confusion. There were some things 
that you did not say to Natsuki. There were some things that if brought 
up would trigger an incredibly hostile state. Despite being the girl&#39;s 
closest companion and her senpai, even Shizuru had been put in place by 
one heated reaction. She had been specifically forbidden to bring up 
certain things, but there was only one or two that could bring Natsuki 
to the point of genuine fury.

One of those things was to bring up the deceased Alyssa Kruger.

Shizuru held up a hand to show that she only had peace as an intention. 
&quot;Natsuki, no. You&#39;re still thinking about this lifetime. This was before 
any of that happened. This was a literal lifetime ago. This was when the 
Otome were first starting to emerge on Earth, not now.&quot;

&quot;How dare you use my dead sister to further whatever plans of 
insurrection you have!&quot; Natsuki yelled. &quot;Where has your sense of decency 
gone?! If you&#39;re going to turn against Garderobe, just admit that and 
leave my past out of it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not talking about Alyssa Kruger!&quot; Shizuru protested. &quot;I&#39;m talking 
about Alyssa Searrs, the thirteenth HiME and the one person who allowed 
the Carnival cycle to come to a close! The one who idolized you and was 
able to grow into womanhood!&quot;

Shizuru was mad, Natsuki decided. Completely and utterly off her rocker 
to be insinuating such hurtful things. This would have been bad enough 
in private, but there were on a street surrounded by their peers. The 
things Natsuki wanted to talk about least were being made a spectacle 
for all to see. &quot;Shizuru, shut up! All of you get back over here now or 
you&#39;ll be facing charges of treason and will be stripped of your ranks 
as Otome. I am done with this.&quot;

No one moved.

&quot;I mean it! Get over here!&quot; They couldn&#39;t rebel against her. They just 
couldn&#39;t! These were trusted allies and many &#150; Nao, Mai and Shizuru &#150; 
were her closest companions. She hated the Otome more and more for what 
they had done to her most beloved people. They had forced them to become 
people they were not and had tricked them into defecting.

&quot;Sorry, I&#39;d rather not live my life as an old maid like the rest of you 
dateless Columns.&quot; Nao grinned and materialize her claw Elements, 
extending the nails and marveling at them. &quot;Besides, I think I like 
these toys better than the weapon my GEM is equipped with, anyway.&quot;

&quot;Kuga Natsuki, you&#39;re absolutely blind. Open your mind and try and 
embrace what we&#39;re telling you,&quot; Midori lectured. &quot;Your place is over 
here with that big scary wolf of yours.&quot;

Natsuki let out a frustrated sigh and then turned to her former roommate 
and rival. Perhaps there was salvation left in Mai, who could arguably 
be considered the most sympathetic and friendly person in the group she 
was now face with. &quot;Mai? Even you?&quot;

Mai Tokiha could not recall a time when she felt more disturbed. She 
was, quite honestly, a bit ill with the guilt that would accompany 
either of her possible choices. There was truly no way to win. With 
either side, she would be a traitor. They all stared at her expectantly, 
and no sound was uttered save for the rustling of her scarf in the wind. 
Flakes of snow that had been steadily falling since their arrival 
drifted into her view, ensuring that the icy coffin that held and 
preserved the shattered city would remain intact.

&quot;Mai.&quot; Natsuki&#39;s voice ordered her to hurry.

She released a shaky breathe that she had been holding deep in her 
lungs. Mai opened her mouth to say something, but the words failed to 
come. She wanted to go with Natsuki and Garderobe. Her instincts, and 
something that she could not describe, beckoned her to follow the other 
path. She knew nothing of little of several of the others, yet felt 
incredibly comfortable in her presence. Flashes of something danced her 
mind, and slowly and steadily she was beginning to envision every step 
that she had taken during the Carnival. She felt like she was losing 
herself and becoming someone else. A warmth spread through her body in 
the dead of winter as she made her choice, the primal calling of the 
Ikusahime ringing in her very soul.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Natsuki. Our place is here. Eventually, you&#39;re going to see 
that.&quot;

The headmistress was close to screaming out in anger and fury. Why were 
they all doing this? How lost were they? She swore she would put the 
person responsible for their brainwashing into a world of absolute pain 
when she found out who was behind it. Mai removed the GEM from her 
pocket and tossed it on the ground. She held it in her hands, and 
Natsuki&#39;s rightfully betrayed look nearly broke her heart in two. Mai 
extended her arm, tears in her eyes, non-verbally begging for 
forgiveness from her former rival and lifelong friend. She loved her 
companions on Natsuki&#39;s side. But it was not in their ranks that she 
belonged.

Natsuki, already feeling utterly betrayed and hurt, found herself 
focusing on both Tomoe and Shizuru, who were still standing rather 
closely together. The conversation itself had worn Natsuki down. She 
reacted off pure emotion. She had come to learn, in time, how Shizuru 
escaped from her prison during the last war. That, coupled with the fact 
that she knew all too well that after she had graduated from Garderobe 
and left Natsuki behind, Shizuru had fallen for her contract. Those same 
feelings of abandonment were coming back at her with amazing force.

&quot;And even you, Shizuru?&quot; Natsuki asked. &quot;Even though you told me years 
ago that you would only fight for your most important person?&quot;

&quot;I am fighting for my most important person, Natsuki.&quot;

With Tomoe standing so close to her, Natsuki took that statement in 
completely the wrong way. As she watched as the remaining traitors made 
evident their new side, she lost her senses of reasoning and failed to 
hear the further protests around her. Haruka had marched forward and 
pointed right at her master, more than willing to voice her opinions on 
the matter.

&quot;Yukino!&quot; Haruka shouted. &quot;I&#39;m not going to stand for this. You&#39;re a 
president, not some cultist rebel! You can&#39;t fight against the Otome. 
We&#39;ve protected you for years. Does this mean nothing?&quot;

Yukino had tears in her eyes. &quot;Haruka-chan, I can&#39;t turn my back on the 
HiME. They&#39;re right. The Otome were never meant to come into existence. 
We have to rectify those wrongs while we still have a second chance to 
work with. I need you, Haruka-chan. You&#39;re my Key and most important 
person. Please come over here with us.&quot;

&quot;Yu-ki-no...&quot; Haruka stressed. Her arms were crossed. She tapped her 
foot impatiently. &quot;You can&#39;t work with the desert rat and the psychotic 
Valkyrie! What would the people of Aries think?&quot;

&quot;Dealing with a perversion of HiME powers is more important,&quot; Yukino 
said sternly. &quot;Aries can wait. Disbanding the Otome must come first.&quot;

Haruka was a warrior and she was not about to give up the one thing that 
allowed her to stand head and shoulders above all her enemies. Otome 
power was vital to laying waste to anyone who stood in her way. Yukino 
wanted her to give all that up? Idiotic! &quot;If I give up my powers, who 
would protect you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a HiME and you are a Key. It&#39;s my job to protect you.&quot;

She was not a door unlocker, dammit! What did a key have to do with her? 
Haruka&#39;s thinking fell in line with Natsuki&#39;s. They had all simply gone 
mad and fell victim to HiME brainwashing tactics. Yukino? Protecting 
Haruka? It nearly made the blonde laugh! Yukino couldn&#39;t defend her from 
a pop-tart! She saw Ann move next to her, and watched as her onee-sama 
moved forward in hopes of speaking with the traitors.

&quot;Shizuru, do you understand exactly what it is that you&#39;re doing?&quot; Ann 
asked. Shizuru nodded. &quot;Then you would draw your weapon and fight 
against me if it came to that? Would you kill me, Shizuru-chan?&quot;

After a long moment, Shizuru nodded again. &quot;I do what I must.&quot;

&quot;Ara, how disappointing,&quot; Ann said. &quot;You&#39;re far too beautiful to maim, 
Shizuru. You make life so difficult for me sometimes.&quot;

Natsuki stood perfectly still. There was rumbling in the distance &#150; no 
doubt another battle starting up somewhere in the city. She stared right 
at Shizuru, who returned the gaze with equal emotion. There was rage 
present on both their faces. With Natsuki, it was because Shizuru had 
brought up things that should have never again been brought up. With 
Shizuru, it was pure frustration that Natsuki was unable to acknowledge 
her own buried memories. Both hoped that the other would concede and 
apologize. The two were too strong and too proud to do so.

&quot;So that&#39;s it, then,&quot; Natsuki said. &quot;You would turn your back against me 
and Garderobe because of some out of this world and insulting idea 
that&#39;s been fed to you by the HiME.&quot;

&quot;I am doing what must be done. If you would just remember your love for 
Fujino Shizuru, and your love for Alyssa S-&quot;

&quot;Do not say that name again,&quot; Natsuki ordered.

Shizuru took a breath, vexed and out of ideas on how she could possibly 
wake up Kuga Natsuki from within Natsuki Kruger. She removed her GEM 
from her pocket and threw it to the ground in an act of rebellion and 
defiance. With one swift movement, she slammed her foot down on top of 
the Graceful Amethyst and shattered it into a thousand purple pieces, 
the microchips inside breaking along with the jeweled outer shell. The 
bridge had been burnt and there was no going back to Garderobe now. Mai 
followed suit with her own GEM.

One of the original GEMs has been lost! Several of the Otome immediately 
thought.

&quot;The next time we meet,&quot; Natsuki said to her former lover, &quot;we will be 
enemies. As headmistress of Garderobe, I am obligated to follow the 
Otome laws and either imprison you or order your execution. If you are 
wise, Shizuru, you will not continue with whatever it is you are 
planning to do.&quot;

&quot;The last thing I want to do is hurt you, Natsuki. I am afraid that I 
might have to in order to remove the Otome from both worlds,&quot; Shizuru 
admitted. &quot;You were never able to defeat me in sparring matches when you 
were younger. Do not attempt to threaten my life now.&quot;

Many of the Ikusahime began to turn and walk away, not willing to fight 
in such a manner. Miyu stared long and hard at the sister of her 
Ojou-sama, and realized it would be a fruitless endeavor to try and 
convince her to follow. She was the first to leave. Nao, Tomoe and 
Midori were next. Then Mai and Mikoto. The last to move were Shizuru and 
Yukino, who stared forlornly at their Keys before they turned and began 
to walk away.

Natsuki could have fired at their retreating forms, but did not. They 
disappeared back under Diana&#39;s protective illusion and once again left 
the street barren and empty. Natsuki was motionless for several long 
moments before she pivoted on her heel and began to march back towards 
Dammerung to revise her strategies and plan for her next attack against 
the HiME. Whoever tricked her comrades into this... she would make them 
pay. As Natsuki left the area, followed closely by her loyal soldiers, 
she had to blink back tears in order to prevent them from falling on the 
fresh fallen snow.

- - -

Well, the war&#39;s officially on, then! If you do not recognize the song 
Midori was singing, then you need to go embrace your inner child. - nod
