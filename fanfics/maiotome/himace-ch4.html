<h1>Mai HiMACE (part 4 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maiotome/index.html">Mai Otome</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/226.html">22671991</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maiotome/himace-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Tokyo District 6 was a fairly up-market place, especially for the 
commercial buyers, square kilometres of expansive green belt interlaced 
with sprawling bands of suburban-style family housing. The District 
itself covered mostly rolling hills, which the developers had left in to 
add to the scenic appearance, and the foliage was so thick that from the 
air it gave an impression of the surrounding forest slowly invading the 
city. Interspersed between the trees and rows of houses were a sparse 
few larger buildings, all several storeys and generously large though 
nothing too outsized, in keeping with the more relaxed architecture 
outside of the city centre. They were all generally the same 
square-shaped grey concrete box, slope-roofed and wide windows. The Bank 
building was no exception; it stood comfortably beside a large main 
road, huge glass panel windows taking up most of the first storey front 
wall facing onto the road with a set of tall glass double-doors set into 
a gold-painted metal frame. Fluorescent lighting hung in narrow box 
strips from the front wall up above the entranceway, illuminating the 
pavement outside and spilling onto the nearby road. Yet more, brilliant 
white light poured out from within at all hours, day or night, and the 
hazy orange glow in the sky from streetlights and the swarming mass of 
Tokyo all around gave a strangely warm, late evening sort of vibe to the 
place, especially on such a mild summer night.

Natsuki checked her watch again. The softly glowing green panel said it 
had just gone midnight. If she was going to be logical and assume that 
the voice on the phone had been telling the truth, then in about another 
ten minutes that calm, peaceful bank building across the road was going 
to be mysteriously evacuated. Just looking at the place, she could see 
no signs of warning, no indication that anyone strange was happening or 
that anything alarming was expected. Just inside the lobby was a wide 
glass-screened desk just as with most banks, and only a single very 
calm-looking employee sitting waiting behind it, leaning a little 
tiredly on the counter. Everything looked perfectly normal.

Five minutes later, something started bleeping furiously. Natsuki 
startled out of her semi-conscious state leaning up against a 
streetlight and almost fell over before her balance kicked in again. It 
sounded like an alarm, yes, but not quite, though it did appear to be 
coming from the bank. Inside the building, the lonely employee was 
blinking and looking around, thoroughly puzzled.

A second man appeared through the door behind him and started talking, 
to which the employee replied, although Natsuki could hear none of it. 
The manager, as she presumed him to be from the first man&#39;s body 
language, looked just as confused as did the first man and between the 
two of them, they exchanged unheard words and plenty of mystified 
gestures.

Not a minute later, the bleeping stopped, though it was still somewhat 
unclear just where it had been coming from in the first place.

Natsuki was quite completely bemused by now. An alarm, or so it seemed, 
had just gone off and then stopped shortly thereafter. The employee in 
the bank didn&#39;t seem too worried about it, beyond being just as confused 
as she, and nothing was really happening.

She sighed heavily and leant back up against the streetlight again, 
watching intently for any signs of further action.

At twelve fifteen precisely, down to the last second, something 
definitely did happen. That same beeping alarm went off again and, just 
as the teller was getting up to see what was going on, the ceiling 
started raining. That got results. In just a few seconds, the doors were 
open and a pitifully small group of employees, including the manager 
from before, came rushing out of the building quite soaked.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Natsuki muttered darkly to herself. &quot;Some opening...&quot; She looked 
long and hard over the building but, as her earlier scouting had proven, 
there were no windows on the others sides and the front entrance was the 
only way in which was at that moment being blocked by all those 
employees.

Something bumped against her foot.

Natsuki looked down for a second. There on the ground, where she really 
should have noticed it before was something small, square and black. She 
bent down to inspect a little closer and found it to be a leather pouch 
of some kind. When she picked it up, it flipped open like a book and 
revealed some sort of laminated card within. On one side, stitched to 
the leather, was an identification card sans picture, on the other side 
was a small sheet of plastic printed with long strings of numbers and 
free hanging between the two &quot;covers&quot; was a green holographic card.

Natsuki checked the ID card first...

&quot;Tokyo District Materials Handling Commission?&quot;

Someone had a strange sense of humour.

Well, &#39;act casual&#39; the mysterious voice had told her. If nothing else, 
at least it was worth a try. She tucked the wallet into a pocket inside 
her suit jacket and then strode resolvedly over towards the building.

&quot;Hey!&quot; someone shouted when she walked straight past the crowd. &quot;Hey, 
you there! Miss, you can&#39;t go in there.&quot;

She turned on her heel, making sure to toss her hair impressively 
without making it look like she was trying, and gave the owner of that 
voice a good hard glare. &quot;I&#39;m afraid I have to,&quot; she told him in a stern 
voice. &quot;I&#39;m from the M.H.C. and we&#39;re aware that there are a few rather 
delicate items in your vault. I&#39;ve been sent to keep an eye on them.&quot;

The manager, or he whom Natsuki had presumed to be the manager, stepped 
forward. &quot;First I&#39;ve heard of anything like this,&quot; he replied 
suspiciously. Natsuki flashed him an almost contemptuous look.

&quot;It&#39;s a classified matter,&quot; she said, as if that was as much explanation 
as was needed.

&quot;The vault is locked. I can&#39;t let you in there, even if you are from the 
Commission; some of our clients have extremely valuable property in 
there.&quot;

Natsuki took the wallet out of her jacket and showed it off impatiently. 
&quot;I have the authority to order you...&quot; The manager shook his head. 
&quot;...but that doesn&#39;t matter, does it? All I need is assurance for my 
employers that the items in question are safe inside your vault, and 
photographic proof is all they&#39;ll take.&quot;

The manager fished into one of his own pockets for a moment and produced 
a set of keys, which he tossed over towards the woman. &quot;The green key 
opens the door to the back of the building,&quot; he explained with a 
slightly softer expression. &quot;But the vault key isn&#39;t on there...just in 
case you were wondering.&quot;

Natsuki smirked back at him. &quot;Thank you for your cooperation.&quot; With 
that, she turned her back to the small crowd and proceeded inside the 
building.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The little black alarm clock on the desk beside the bed was blaring away 
unbearably loud, filling the small bedroom up with the noise of some 
unreasonably lively Japanese morning radio host or other. It was 
impossible to tell if he really was talking loudly just to be heard over 
the rambunctious pop music in the background, or if it was simply the 
alarm itself turned up too far. A single hand reached up out of the 
disorderly mass of tangled yellow sheets and slapped about at the thing, 
failing completely in hitting the &quot;OFF&quot; button. Eventually, the hand 
gave up and whacked the radio off the desk to the floor with a loud 
thud, upon which it shut up.

Approximately fifteen seconds later, it started again. A string of 
curses started from somewhere in that thick pile of bedding and didn&#39;t 
stop, getting only louder and angrier as they progressed, and ever more 
profane. The sheets slowly folded back down along the bed until a head, 
or more precisely a large lump of unruly crimson hair, could be seen. 
The head, clearly female from the shape and form of that roughly 
triangular face, lifted itself clear of the bed and leaned right over 
the edge, upside-down, trying to see the radio a little better.

The owner of the head felt her feet slipping, and before she knew it she 
was upside-down herself, balanced on her head on the floor still half 
in-bed. The sudden concussive shock to her cranium did nothing to help 
the splitting hangover already molesting her consciousness and she 
groaned, long and hard, then started swearing again for good measure.

The clock said five thirty.

Five. Fucking. Thirty.

In the fucking morning.

&quot;Midori,&quot; chided a familiar voice that the bed-bound woman knew was only 
in her head. &quot;You really need to get up, already! You&#39;ll be late for 
school,&quot; it chuckled teasingly.

&quot;Youko...&quot; She sighed, smiling ruefully as she did practically every 
morning, and went about extricating herself from the mess that was her 
bed. It took, unsurprisingly, longer than it had the last time, much as 
it did every time. Once it was all over and she stood at the foot of the 
bed, naked bar the cheapest shorts she could afford, Midori got the 
profound impression that she had forgotten something hugely important.

She looked up at the wall above her bed. It was the only wall in the 
room still blank, no sign of brackets or posters or pin-boards or the 
like as had the other three. It would have been as nude as she almost 
was herself, had it not been for the messily scrawled symbol she had 
painted on it by hand; a huge red ring with a narrow gap cut out, a 
thick line running through one side next to said gap, and a simple red 
dot in the centre of the ring.

&quot;Okay!&quot; said Midori to herself animatedly, snapping her fingers. &quot;Today, 
I&#39;m going to show those assholes who they&#39;re messing with! Right 
Kan-chan?&quot;

Before she could get an answer, the door opened and in barged a 
dark-haired young man with a huge stack of books cradled in his arms. 
&quot;Midori-san!&quot; he yelped a little helplessly, teetering over to one side.

Midori leapt into action, heedless of her rather compromised state of 
dress, and just managed to catch the toppling pile by the very narrowest 
breadth. The mug of coffee that had been sitting atop the stack went to 
the floor and shattered, splashing luke-warm brown liquid in an uneven 
splodge over the carpet.

She ignored the young man apologising wildly to her and staring at her 
breasts, and trying not to look like he was staring, and simultaneously 
backing out of her bedroom and bowing which only made him blush more 
since it put his face inches from her chest. She shut the door on him, 
sighed again, and then kicked the remains of the nth broken coffee mug 
up against the nearest wall out of the way.

&quot;Hopeless boy, really,&quot; she told herself. &quot;I don&#39;t know why I keep him 
around.&quot;

When she opened the first book, naturally the biggest one, and found it 
was actually a hollowed out box painted to look like a book, in which 
sat a small bottle full of some clear liquid, Midori&#39;s face lit up with 
a self-conscious grin. &quot;Am I really getting so predictable?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve been predictable ever since we met, Midori,&quot; said that invisible 
voice in her head again.

Determined to throw off Youko&#39;s nagging little motherly speeches in the 
back of her mind, the redheaded woman threw on the first sweater she 
saw, which just so happened to be clean, and then slumped herself down 
in the small metal stool next to her bedroom wall. She span and faced 
what might once have been a wall, now a huge mess of tangled wires, 
cables, mounting brackets, faced with mainly pin-boards and slate, cork 
boards and calendars, a few maps of various places large and small, and 
a few extremely inexpensive monitor screens that showed little more than 
static at the moment.

&quot;It&#39;s the seventeenth,&quot; she said to herself as she read off the nearest 
calendar, scribbling out the number with red marker pen. &quot;The satellite 
should be passing over China this afternoon... Maybe by tomorrow, 
then...&quot; She turned her head and continued, a little louder, &quot;Oi! 
Kan-chan! You awake?&quot;

&quot;I do not have an &quot;awake&quot; mode, mistress,&quot; replied a rough synthesised 
voice from a large stripped-down speaker attached to the far wall.

Midori frowned and tossed a discarded paper cup over her shoulder at the 
source of the voice. &quot;You really need a sense of humour, Kan-chan.&quot;

&quot;Emotional simulation processes are illegal by current international AI 
laws, not that I really need to remind you. Indeed,&quot; said the computer 
in what would almost have been a cynical tone of voice, had it had 
actual feelings. &quot;I&#39;m certain yet another infraction would not trouble 
you in the slightest, mistress. In fact, I&#39;m sure that the Tokyo police 
force would enjoy watching your Interpol wanted rating climbing back up 
the chart again. They do seem to be rather proud of you.&quot;

Midori smirked to herself and started unscrewing the top on her 
miniature vodka bottle. &quot;So, I take it from your witty rejoinder that 
you&#39;ve been working hard while I was asleep?&quot;

&quot;Yes, mistress. I&#39;ve been keeping close tabs on the worm our associate 
delivered for us. It broke past the cipher system with little problem at 
all; in fact, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a Gellard code so elegantly 
applied as this one. I do feel a little jealous.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re much smarter than a worm, Kan-chan,&quot; reassured Midori, more just 
out of habit than to comfort the AI&#39;s non-existent feelings. She tossed 
half of the contents of that tiny bottle down her throat and coughed 
harshly at the after-effects. &quot;Worms can&#39;t do half the things you do.&quot;

&quot;Truly, your words fill me with joy, mistress.&quot;

&quot;But seriously now, Kan-chan,&quot; Midori insisted, shuffling the seat along 
the narrow rail that ran around the edge of the room until she faced a 
large holographic relief map of Asia. &quot;If the code was worth what we 
agreed, then go ahead and pay the man.&quot;

&quot;The worm did not succeed in its intended function, mistress.&quot;

Midori shrugged, a look of clearly faked innocence on her face.

&quot;But,&quot; continued the computer, &quot;I did spot several rather interesting 
code fluctuations in the area around Prometheus&#39; floating net construct. 
I&#39;d be willing to hazard a guess, if I were so inclined, that the 
construct is precisely the multi-processor that you&#39;ve been so 
diligently searching for all these months.&quot;

Midori crossed her arms smugly over her chest, but declined the chance 
to boast yet again. &quot;If Prometheus are hiding a multiple-base processor 
underneath a resident network AI construct, then they must be hiding it 
from someone inside their own organisation.&quot; Midori rubbed a hand over 
her forehead and sighed, again. &quot;Which makes no sense at all. Prometheus 
have nothing to hide from themselves. Their security should be external 
not internal.&quot;

&quot;May I make a few wild speculations, mistress?&quot;

&quot;Speculate away, Kan-chan. You&#39;re the one with the technical know-how, 
after all.&quot; Midori leaned back into her chair until the backrest clicked 
right down almost horizontal and started fiddling with a small trackball 
set into one armrest, manipulating the map before her to show various 
different areas around the world. What the little green markers meant, 
only Midori herself knew, but wherever something really suspicious was 
going on, there was a little miniature replica of that strange 
almost-but-not-quite-a-question-mark symbol plastered on the map.

&quot;Well, first of all, Prometheus deal in technologies that the outside 
world has simply never even heard of. They would be wise to guard their 
secrets well even from their own employees, not to mention the 
industrial enemies they have around the world with the expertise to hack 
into their network from outside. A de-centralised networked processor 
capable of actual self-aware intelligence would be the find of the 
decade, so to speak. They could lose a lot of money.&quot;

&quot;Not to mention it&#39;d piss off Intel. Haven&#39;t they been pouring money 
into floating net intelligence for years now?&quot;

&quot;I would gladly explain why the R&ouml;rschack hybrid cell undergoes fractal 
degradation when they push the voltage too high...&quot;

Midori waved her hands frantically. &quot;Too much jargon, Kan-chan! I&#39;m not 
a computer like you, remember?&quot; She chuckled. &quot;Besides, I&#39;m not selling 
you to anyone, Kan-chan. That creativity sub-processor of yours is worth 
more than anyone could offer.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully worth the several truckloads of liquid silver you exchanged 
for it, mistress,&quot; retorted the computer, and Midori could only laugh 
again.

&quot;I assume that&#39;s not your best idea though, eh Kan-chan?&quot;

&quot;I think that, perhaps, just perhaps...&quot; Kannon was silent for a few 
moments, which was certainly unusual, so long that Midori actually felt 
a little bubble of concern growing in her stomach.

&quot;Kan-chan? What is it?&quot;

&quot;I think,&quot; continued the computer in an oddly subdued &quot;voice,&quot; &quot;that the 
self-aware AI hidden in Prometheus&#39; network system might actually be the 
exact same multi-processor AI that you&#39;ve been looking for, mistress; a 
fully conscious neural net.&quot;

Midori bolted upright in her chair, then winced when the backrest 
snapped up and thwacked her in the back. &quot;You mean...&quot; she trailed off, 
rubbing the small of her back with one hand and frantically scrolling 
the map screen with the other. &quot;Prometheus might actually have a 
functioning Slave unit already?&quot;

&quot;Unlikely. They have no experience in biotechnologies or genetics. A 
completed Slave at this stage is out of the question unless they&#39;re 
already attached to another contributor who does have access to genetic 
reconstructive technology.&quot;

Midori zoomed down over the mid-southwest area of North America until a 
large, suspicious dark blotch could be made out somewhere in the middle 
of Arizona. &quot;Who do we know who does?&quot;

&quot;The only viable option for Prometheus at this time would be SiltWorks, 
Germany. They&#39;re based in biochemical and genetics and have a small 
enough financial framework to appreciate support from a large 
organisation such as Prometheus, not to mention the technology to 
support an actual Slave production.&quot;

Midori grinned, not her favourite kind of grin but definitely close, the 
grin she used whenever several large and annoying bits of the puzzle 
that her life had become suddenly fell into place. She cracked her 
knuckles. &quot;Then let&#39;s investigate, Kan-chan! Who can we work with in 
Germany?&quot;

&quot;Yes, mistress. I&#39;ll bring up your list of European based associates 
now...&quot;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heat.

The heat was everywhere.

The heat was all around her, burning into her, searing through her, 
consuming her. It tore into her skin like a wild beast, ripped its way 
into and straight through her, flaying her apart like so much useless 
lace and ribbon in the face of some formless raging fury.

How eloquent, she thought for a moment.

Then suddenly, something cold was on her chest, latched deep into her. 
She was suffocating. Agony lancing into her arms and legs like 
needles...

Nina woke screaming, wailing, clawing out with her hands and ripping the 
sheet apart with her fingernails. She thrashed wildly, tearing needles 
from all sorts of places and leaving thin, weak red trails splashing out 
after them. She didn&#39;t notice her blood spilling over the bed-sheets, or 
all those holes sealing themselves again in seconds. Her fingers clasped 
around the rubber guard over her lower face, and she tore that off too, 
yanking the tube out of her nose and retching as it passed the back of 
her throat.

The first spasm stopped in her diaphragm but a second followed quickly, 
then a third, setting off a chain reaction until the semi-conscious girl 
was curled over, head between her knees, emptying her stomach onto the 
bed between her feet. When she finally stopped convulsing, her body 
weight drifted to one side and she fell, lying limply on her side still 
curled up in a foetal position, drooling down one cheek and shuddering.

When she finally came to again some million years later she was soaked 
in sweat, sticky and uncomfortable, her feet dunked in that disgusting 
puddle on the bed, and her hands still wouldn&#39;t stop quivering.

&quot;Where am I,&quot; she tried to say, but her voice caught in her throat so 
raw and dry after all the heaving she had done. She tried to raise her 
head but it was so heavy, like her whole body were made of lead.

An orderly found her not too long after and made a big fuss, but nobody 
seemed too concerned. The sheets were removed, Nina was put on a trolley 
and moved into the adjacent room which just so happened to be empty, and 
then someone sedated her again before she could protest further. She 
just managed to spot a large pitcher of water being left on the table by 
the bed before her eyelids sagged shut again.

For a long time, there was nothing. Dark, empty, silent nothing.

Then there was a voice.

&quot;Nina?&quot; whispered the voice.

So hesitant, so unsure of itself, like a confused and panicked young 
child asking after its mother. Nina screwed her face up in her 
pseudo-sleep and tried to ignore it.

&quot;Nina...chan?&quot;

That voice...that was familiar.

She opened her eyes, very slowly since the room was filled with bright 
blinding white light from the strips in the ceiling, and tried to lift 
her head to see. All she saw was a vague, distorted swirl of coloured 
blobs.

&quot;Nina-chan?&quot; repeated the voice, suddenly sounding that much more 
alarmed. A hand brushed her shoulder.

&quot;Fa...&quot; Her voice broke again and she started coughing, until something 
large and warm buried itself against her lower chest with a wild sob. 
Nina blinked, startled out of her coughing fit it seemed, and tried to 
sit up. As she blinked repeatedly, her vision slowly started to slur 
together into something a little more cohesive than just jumbled colour, 
shapes forming vague at first and gradually sharpening. When she looked 
down, there was a head in her lap, thick waves of long brown-red hair 
flowing down either side of her legs and pooling on the bed.

&quot;A...ari...ka?&quot;

The other girl didn&#39;t answer, probably couldn&#39;t. Nina could feel 
dampness seeping through the thin green sheet and slicking the skin of 
her abdomen. Arika&#39;s shoulders were twitching up and down as she cried 
silently, her entire body shaking softly. She tried to put a reassuring 
hand on the girl&#39;s head but her arms were limp, dead.

&quot;You&#39;re...you&#39;re alive... I&#39;m alive! But I thought...&quot;

Arika lifted her head up slowly to look her in the eye. Her face was a 
mess, all red and scrunched up and smeared with tears still streaming 
down her cheeks. There was something awful behind her eyes that hit Nina 
like a lightning bolt to the chest, but the words to explain it escaped 
her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I k...killed you,&quot; Arika began as imploringly as she could. 
The sheer absurdity of it caught up to her before she could continue, 
however, and she started sniggering.

&quot;You&#39;re sorry you killed me?&quot; Nina tried to sound as sharp and 
unforgiving as ever but it didn&#39;t really work. She smiled down at the 
ball of emotion in her lap and, finally, lifted one hand up to beat her 
lightly on the head. &quot;That must be the craziest thing you&#39;ve ever said 
to me...dummy.&quot;

Arika opened her mouth again and a bark of a laugh came out, followed by 
more. Her eyes were streaming, but at least it was an improvement on the 
bawling she had been doing a few hours before.

&quot;I hope you&#39;re sorry for getting my robe burned up, too.&quot;

Arika started bashing one fist against the bed-frame, howling then and 
rolling side to side slightly, her face still buried in Nina&#39;s lap. The 
dark-haired girl felt her face heating a little when she finally noticed 
what the redhead was inadvertently doing, but it really wasn&#39;t worth 
ruining such a good mood. Now that she had a moment to stop and actually 
think about it, she noticed Arika&#39;s own robe was gone too, replaced with 
a very simple piece of green cloth that tied shut at the back and left 
most of the girl&#39;s back half bare. Not exactly something becoming a 
young Otome like herself.

There was a really touching, emotional scene brewing up between the two, 
something seriously deep and meaningful, some world-changing 
revelations. Unfortunately, before it could happen, the door burst open 
and an unidentified person in a bulky white hazardous material suit 
complete with shaded faceplate rushed into the room.

Arika looked up and blinked, just in time to get a face-full of thick 
beige foam from the end of what looked like a handheld water cannon. 
Nina was stunned for a moment, but that familiar feeling of righteous 
vengeance was broiling within her like a caged animal. She grabbed the 
redhead by her shoulders and pulled her close. As something thick and 
sludgy splattered against her back and started solidifying, gluing her 
to the bed, her lips found the GEM in Arika&#39;s left ear.

&quot;Yumemiya Arika,&quot; she whispered, which was all she could manage. &quot;In my 
name, release your power!&quot;

When all that blinding light died down it was only her training robe 
after all, but it was much better than nothing at all. The foam 
shattered from her face, revealing a most determined look of rage on 
Arika&#39;s features.

&quot;Oh shit!&quot; yelled a muffled and indistinctly masculine voice from behind 
the faceplate. &quot;GEM system is active, I repeat, GEM system is active! I 
think we-..&quot; Arika shut him up with a good solid kick to the gut that 
sent him toppling over onto his face on the floor, groaning and wheezing 
and trying to breathe in. She lifted the steel-silver baton over her 
head for a nice hard whack but Nina stopped her with a yelp.

&quot;Forget about that! We need to get out of here, first. Wherever here 
is...&quot; She looked around at the room, at all the strange things sitting 
about in strange places. &quot;I&#39;m not even sure where we are.&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t WindBloom,&quot; replied Arika in a very terse voice, lowering 
her weapon cautiously to her side. She gave the prone man a kick in the 
ribs instead, just to make sure he didn&#39;t get up any time soon, and 
perhaps to work a little of her own anger out in the process. While Nina 
searched from her vantage point on the bed, Arika hefted the downed man 
by his legs over against one wall of the room, then cracked the door 
open as narrowly as she could and peeked outside.

&quot;Or Artai. Or any other country I&#39;ve ever been to. I&#39;ve never seen 
architecture quite like this...&quot;

&quot;Shit!&quot; Arika interrupted, slamming the door shut and fiddling with the 
catch, desperately trying to engage the lock with an almost panicked 
expression on her face.

Nina glared at her a tad angrily. &quot;What now?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t want to know!&quot; Arika turned on her heel and, having given up 
on the door, started looking frantically around the room. Her eyes 
caught on the window, barred across with narrow metal strips, and she 
winced. &quot;How badly are you hurt, Nina-chan? Can you walk?&quot;

Nina felt an &quot;oh shit&quot; of her own coming, or perhaps an exasperated 
sigh; the girl could still get herself in some terribly stupid 
situations after all. She shifted her weight over to one side and slid 
her legs off the bed. &quot;I can stand. I&#39;m not sure about walking...&quot; She 
lifted herself up, weight on her feet, and then toppled forward 
slightly. Slender, muscular arms were wrapped about her before she could 
even register surprise.

&quot;I&#39;ll just have to carry you!&quot; declared Arika, irrationally cheerful 
once again. She held the dark-haired girl against her in one arm and 
swung her baton with the other, extending out to punch through the 
window. Metal twisted and snapped, splintered off, a burst of glass and 
steel shards showering out of the room and down on the street below. 
There was a thumping at the door but neither looked back. Nina was swung 
like a featherweight round to rest against Arika&#39;s back, arms around the 
redhead&#39;s collar, and held on tight as they leapt up into open space. 
Arika&#39;s GEM was glowing brightly as she burst out of the hole that had 
once been a window, the wooden door shattering open seconds behind her. 
More white-suited and foam-wielding figures rushed into the room only to 
catch a glimpse of the pair fading away into the distance over the Tokyo 
skyline.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Midori windmilled her arms as she toppled backwards off her chair and 
onto the floor with a hefty thud. Lights were flashing and sirens were 
blaring at her all of a sudden and the holographic map was going 
proverbially bat-shit.

&quot;Kannon!&quot; she yelled as she struggled back into her seat, rubbing at her 
shoulder blades with one hand. &quot;Kannon, what the hell is that alarm?&quot;

&quot;That,&quot; replied the computer calmly as ever, &quot;is the surveillance 
program you had planted in the GPS system last year.&quot;

&quot;The fuck?&quot; Midori blinked. &quot;Then that could only mean...something I 
forget.&quot; She brought the nearest bottle to her lips and started 
chugging.

&quot;It&#39;s picking up a short range radio transmission, a localised binary 
signal it would seem, of all things.&quot;

Midori almost fell off her chair again. She chucked her now empty bottle 
carelessly over her shoulder and stared at the map as it skittered about 
crazily, focusing in and out. &quot;How much did we pay for that thing? I 
swear, if it&#39;s going to just... Wait...&quot; She paused for a moment while 
her brain switched back on, and getting a good yawn while she was at it. 
&quot;You mean the sort of signal that those brand new highly illegal 
nano-machines respond to?&quot;

&quot;The very same, mistress. And it&#39;s coming from somewhere in the Tokyo 
downtown area.&quot;

Midori blinked again.

&quot;Fuck!&quot; She leapt up out of her chair and dashed over to what had once 
been a wardrobe, now simply a huge mess with some clothes in it. &quot;Then 
I&#39;ve gotta get out there and find the bastards! If I can get 
photographical proof that our &quot;friends&quot; are playing with illegal 
nanotechnology right under the public&#39;s nose, it&#39;ll be one huge step 
closer to exposing the whole project.&quot;

&quot;Need I remind you, mistress, that it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that the 
transponder in question...&quot;

Midori wasn&#39;t listening. She scrambled crazily to dress herself in the 
neatest pair of jeans she could find and then threw a loose green 
button-up sweater on over the skimpy bikini top she had rescued earlier. 
Her hair went back in a single rough ponytail held together with an 
elastic band, not the most attractive of dress styles but it didn&#39;t 
really matter. She snagged the plastic wrap-around gas mask from where 
it hung on a hook beside her bedroom door and started working it down 
over her face.

&quot;Kan-chan, did that fool Reito fix the damn car yet?&quot;

&quot;Your...vehicle,&quot; the computer replied in what could almost pass for a 
contemptuous tone of voice, &quot;is ready for action, mistress. I do hope 
you&#39;re a little more careful with it this time though.&quot;

Midori grinned. &quot;I put a lot of work into that car! It&#39;ll take more than 
a few little scrapes to stop her.&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Natsuki was...well &#39;bothered&#39; would be a good word for it. She sat back 
a little in the booth she currently occupied and pushed the empty glass 
away across the table, the last few dredges of half-melted ice cream and 
green lemonade (why did they even make green lemonade, of all things?) 
forming a sludgy greenish mess in the bottom. Her left leg rose 
practically of its own accord and folded slowly over her right, shifting 
her skirt a little higher, though nowhere quite near dangerously so just 
yet. The sunlight streaming in through the wide panel windows beside her 
was warming on the bare skin of her arms and legs and across her neck 
and collar, the low cut and short sleeves of her thin, sky blue top most 
tempting to the eyes but leaving practically everything to the 
imagination.

The waitress came back after a minute or two and whisked the empty glass 
away, but not before Natsuki could molest her for a second. Or would 
that be her third? The green-haired young woman smiled perkily and 
disappeared back to wherever it was a waitress went, leaving Natsuki to 
her thoughts again.

Bothered she most definitely was. That bank job had been easy, 
shockingly easy in fact. The mysterious key she had been given had 
opened, of all things, a small black lock-box hidden in one of the 
employees&#39; desks. Inside had been a thick sheaf of papers, all of them 
profoundly odd.

Natsuki took one of the papers out of the pocket of her skirt and 
unfolded it on the table, staring down at it curiously for the nth time 
that day. It was hand-written in a style she couldn&#39;t quite recognise, 
no doubt Shizuru would, or failing that her infallible secretary. Didn&#39;t 
the girl have a qualification in journalism? Besides the handwriting, 
there was the fact that &quot;Tokiha&quot; was buried in the stamp, signifying 
some possible connection to...

...that woman.

Natsuki felt a strange sensation of nervous discomfort slithering up her 
spine at the thought of that redheaded maniac and shook her head firmly 
to clear it. No doubt she indeed had something to do with all this; Mai 
had been giving her a profound feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu ever since their first 
meeting that Natsuki found she simply couldn&#39;t throw.

A sharp trilling noise brought her out of her thoughts, blinking away 
confusion. She reached into her pocket and swapped the paper for a phone 
instead, flicking open that razor-thin piece of plastic and gazing at 
the screen for a second.

Shizuru.

She pressed a button and brought the handset to her ear. &quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Good afternoon, or perhaps evening. It&#39;s been hours since Motoko let me 
out of my office so I can&#39;t really say...&quot; Shizuru sounded like she was 
pouting childishly, as she probably was.

&quot;Whatever,&quot; replied Natsuki somewhat tersely. &quot;I except you didn&#39;t call 
just to ask me to come knock out your secretary, hm?&quot;

&quot;My knight in shining armour, eh Natsuki-chan?&quot; Shizuru giggled softly 
for a moment. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re busy enough for yourself with that 
shop of yours to run, so I won&#39;t bother you with something so trivial.&quot;

Natsuki sighed. &quot;Then what is it, Shizuru?&quot;

&quot;Well if you&#39;d calm down first, perhaps that would help...&quot;

Natsuki paused for a moment. Yes, maybe she was a little tense. Not like 
her to snap so readily at people, even if Shizuru was terribly 
irritating at times. She took a deep breath before continuing, &quot;Sorry. 
It&#39;s been...kind of a strange week.&quot;

&quot;You have no idea,&quot; Shizuru agreed in a most worryingly serious tone of 
voice. &quot;I&#39;m afraid I need your help with something, you see...well I 
know they&#39;re not really my patients, but the unique nature of the 
situation, I think, warrants our intervention.&quot;

&quot;You mean my intervention, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Oh don&#39;t be like that, Natsuki-chan,&quot; Shizuru teased. &quot;I only retired 
because you asked me to.&quot;

Natsuki blushed slightly, but didn&#39;t respond. It would only encourage 
her further, after all.

&quot;Anyway, yesterday we received two emergency patients, both of them 
rather young, female, both of them suffering from dehydration and 
sunburn in all sorts of strange places. They looked like they&#39;d been 
traipsing through a desert or some such foolish thing.&quot;

Natsuki nodded her head politely to the waitress and pulled the fresh 
glass over until her lips found the straw. She mouthed a brief thank you 
and then sipped at the green, bubbling liquid hiding beneath all that 
thick mound of ice cream. &quot;Yeah, I remember you saying something about 
that... So?&quot;

&quot;Well one of them woke up this morning. She was very weak, but she 
recovered beautifully over just the last few hours. She was even 
talking, though she&#39;s got an accent nobody can figure out and half the 
time she speaks English for some reason.&quot;

&quot;Wow...sounds, er...&quot; Natsuki struggled to think of a word that didn&#39;t 
sound too harsh. &quot;...really interesting,&quot; she finally decided on.

Shizuru chuckled on the other end, no doubt shaking her head. &quot;Oh, you 
don&#39;t know the half of it. The other girl woke up a while later in 
convulsions; we had to move her to another room. When the first girl, I 
think her name&#39;s &quot;Arika&quot; actually, from what they&#39;ve been able to piece 
together. Anyway, when she saw us moving the other one, she insisted on 
staying with her so we just left them in the same room together. About 
an hour later, the room was off limits and the management is going 
crazy. They&#39;re say they both &quot;escaped&quot; or something.&quot;

&quot;Escaped?&quot; Natsuki fingered the straw pensively, swirling it slowly 
round and round and mixing the ice cream into her drink. Strange habit 
since she hated it when it turned all thick and gooey like that, but she 
found herself doing it anyway however hard she tried to resist. &quot;What do 
you mean by &quot;escaped&quot; exactly? How do you escape from a hospital 
anyway?&quot;

&quot;Regardless of that, I have to ask you a really big favour.&quot;

&quot;You want me to find them, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Pleeeeeease, Natsuki-chan? I promise I&#39;ll make up to you for it.&quot;

Natsuki shook her head and laughed softly, if a little cynically 
besides. &quot;Don&#39;t be silly. This is my job, after all, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Well, couldn&#39;t really understand him, so I still have no idea where we 
are. Really though, the people around here speak so weird... It&#39;s like a 
whole new country I&#39;ve never even heard of before.&quot; Arika sighed heavily 
to herself and shook her head slowly side to side. &quot;Oi, Nina-chan!&quot; she 
yelled down the alley ahead of her. &quot;I hope you like ramen because 
that&#39;s all I co-&quot; She cut off.

Nina was kneeling on the floor of the alleyway, huddled back against a 
wall with the slightly tattered remains of that thin green robe curled 
defensively around her body. She was looking up with a frightened snarl 
towards a darkly dressed and cloaked figure standing tall, towering over 
her ominously, a hand reaching out towards the young girl.

Arika acted on her first impulse and tried throwing the ramen bowl at 
the stranger. When the mysterious figure simply smashed the bowl away 
with the back of one hand, Arika was already leaping forward, knee up, 
ready to deliver a good solid kick to the gut. She may not have been 
immediately able to fight as the Meister she really was, but she could 
still beat someone senseless when the occasion called for it.

Shockingly red eyes met her coming and froze the young girl in her 
tracks.

&quot;M...M...&quot; she stuttered more than just a little surprised as she 
relaxed back into a passive stance. &quot;M...&quot;

&quot;Good afternoon, Yumemiya-san,&quot; said a very familiar voice from under 
the broad black wide-brimmed hat perched atop the stranger&#39;s head. &quot;It&#39;s 
most fortunate that I found you both so quickly.&quot;

Nina looked towards her redhead companion, then back to the mystery 
individual several times, blinking rapidly. &quot;Wh...what&#39;s going on? 
Arika?&quot;

&quot;Miyu!&quot; yipped the redhead, and tossed herself at the considerably 
taller, older woman. Miyu&#39;s other arm appeared as if by magic from 
beneath the long flowing folds of her cloak and together they encircled 
Arika snugly, holding the girl tight against her front. &quot;I&#39;m so glad to 
see you, Miyu! I thought something strange had happened or 
something...but if you&#39;re here, then-&quot;

&quot;-I&#39;m afraid there is no time to explain,&quot; interrupted Miyu. &quot;I have to 
leave you now, for reasons you should not yet know. I promise, I will 
see you both again very soon.&quot;

Arika pulled back away from the enigmatic blue-haired woman and nodded 
firmly. &quot;Mmm! I&#39;ll take good care of the both of us till you get back!&quot;

Miyu reached deep into her cloak and pulled out a small cardboard tube. 
&quot;You cannot stay here. It isn&#39;t safe. Take this with you and buy some 
clothes.&quot; She offered the tube to Arika who gladly accepted, and then 
followed with a small folded piece of paper. &quot;Find this place. Go there. 
You&#39;ll both be safe, at least for a while. I will see you again there 
when the time comes to move again.&quot;

Arika nodded again. Then she tossed her arms around the android yet 
again and squeezed tight. &quot;Thank you, Miyu-san!&quot; When she let go, Miyu 
was smiling that strange little miniscule smile of hers again and 
looking down at the redhead with an almost maternal expression.

&quot;Goodbye, Yumemiya-san,&quot; she said, turned, and with a whoosh of air she 
was gone.

Arika turned, opening her mouth to speak, but something collided with 
her mid-section before she could say anything. She looked down and found 
Nina with her arms around her waist, face buried against the redhead&#39;s 
stomach, trying her hardest not to cry by the sound of it. She blinked. 
Well, just what exactly could she do?

&quot;Damn it,&quot; muttered Nina, still sniffling. &quot;Stupid...I hate this place. 
I feel so powerless now...so helpless...&quot; She trailed off with a 
whimper. &quot;I...I was...scared.&quot;

Arika put a hand on the dark-haired girl&#39;s head, but resisted the urge 
to comfort her.

&quot;This is so annoying! How can I be such a lost, stupid, helpless 
little...&quot; She trailed off again, bursting out into tears this time. As 
such, she didn&#39;t notice Arika&#39;s arms returning the encapsulating 
gesture.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Nina-chan,&quot; the redhead tried to say in her most 
reassuring voice. &quot;I&#39;ll just go ask where this-&quot;

&quot;-NO!&quot; Nina&#39;s fingers dug into her companion&#39;s hips until her nails 
started biting into the skin. &quot;Don&#39;t...don&#39;t go, please...don&#39;t leave me 
behind again...&quot; She cursed her voice for making her sound so pathetic, 
but it was true. And Arika was the only one who could actually use her 
GEM, after all. By herself, Nina knew, she was practically defenceless.

To her surprise, the arms around her own body shifted again, grasping 
under her shoulders and lifting her up gently until she was on her feet 
again instead of collapsed down on her knees. She looked up and found 
those big blue eyes looking down at her affectionately, which must have 
taken quite some effort on Arika&#39;s part after their recent climactic 
altercation.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Nina-chan. I won&#39;t leave you, I promise.&quot;

Nina slumped down against her front again and started sobbing gently 
under her breath. Arika&#39;s arms closed around her and held her upright.

&quot;From now on, I&#39;m not going anywhere without you.&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The scene; the throng of gathered journalists and pedestrian crowd, the 
calmly stoic police presence around the building, the scattered 
fragments of glass still dusted about the ground. Such controlled chaos, 
and somehow so in keeping with the setting. The hospital certainly had 
seen more than its fair share of crises and the huge debacle that the 
media were attempting to make of the broken window was being mainly 
ignored by the residents and staff alike. The public, of course, felt 
obliged to stop and stare for some reason or other as the public always 
does but the crowd had died down considerably in the short time since 
the incident itself. As the last few glimmers of orange-red sun in the 
evening sky trickled lethargically away into darkness, the gathered 
presence was growing ever sparser.

Shizuru negotiated her way deftly around a cameraman with one 
uncomfortably heavy bag under her left arm and her notebook bag dangling 
from her right shoulder, putting as much effort as she could into 
maintaining her usual dignified, elegant appearance just in case a 
camera or two spotted her. Thankfully, they all seemed to be more 
interested in harassing a poor young uniformed officer who was at that 
moment stammering her way, admirably Shizuru thought to herself, through 
what was clearly a half-baked &quot;official&quot; explanation of the events 
earlier that day.

Something knocked sharply against the small of her back and she turned 
to identify the offending elbow, or at least what had felt like an elbow 
to her, only to find a large, stiff black rectangular bag at least two 
feet in length hanging from a rather burly shoulder. It was clear from 
the shape of the bag that the only thing inside was a large square box, 
of some rather stiff material, that took up almost every breath of space 
within. The zipper was half-open and brushed gunmetal grey lurked 
beneath.

The figure with the bag disappeared into the crowd before anything more 
could happen, taking that bag and its most intriguing contents with him. 
No, it had most definitely been a man, she could tell that much from his 
build alone, what little she had seen.

Shizuru threw it to the back of her mind and continued towards her car 
waiting patiently for her in its usual spot.

Predictably, fate intervened.

A gasp rushed through the crowd, then cries of alarm and surprise, 
confused murmurs, soon turning to a profoundly disturbed sort of noise 
as a dozen voices all clamoured for attention. Someone screamed, 
probably that poor over-worked young policewoman, and Shizuru turned on 
her heel to see what all the commotion was about this time.

She just had time to see a gorgeous cherry red convertible come rushing 
up along the road, back end swinging out with a screech as the driver 
pinned a brutally sharp turn and brought the thing up toward the 
pavement where Shizuru stood. She did not jump, for angry red 
convertibles did not run down Fujino Shizuru, and as well they did 
because the one in question just barely skidded to a stop half a metre 
from her knees. A woman in her early thirties, though she may just as 
easily be a college student, with hair as red as the car itself leapt 
out hurriedly over the door. The rather dashingly handsome man in the 
passenger seat reached over and plucked what looked like a horrible 
fusion of a child&#39;s water cannon and a fire extinguisher and hefted it 
by a thick black strap over one shoulder before following her. Together 
the two dashed across the paving straight past a rather irritated 
Shizuru, towards the focus of considerably more attention.

Well that was just plain strange.

Where there had only shortly before been a nice clean, ordinary wall 
with one rather destroyed window, there was now a most horrendously 
alien monstrosity growing over it, a wide black circle over five metres 
across spreading to cover a large part of the wall, a swirling maelstrom 
of deep purples and reds and bright pinpoints of light. From the eye of 
the storm, as the crowd and the media watched with growing amazement, 
emerged a single bold point; a gleaming silvery-gold spike the size of a 
grown person&#39;s forearm or even bigger. Bigger indeed, as the thing drew 
forth even further, until the spike was a metre in length at the very 
least and attached to the snout of a pointed, snake-like head covered 
with narrow yellow plates over inhuman orange flesh.

&quot;Shit!&quot; The redheaded woman turned to her companion with what seemed to 
be an expression of unrestrained delight on her face. &quot;Are you recording 
this, Rei-kun?&quot;

Her tall, dark-haired male friend did not answer, but instead was 
busying himself pressing random sequences of buttons on a small keypad 
built onto the back of that strange device in his arms.

&quot;Fucking...don&#39;t say the damn thing&#39;s broken again...&quot; Midori turned 
back towards the emerging beast with a very angry scowl, stamping her 
foot. &quot;Piece of shit!&quot;

The creature roared screamed a reptilian scream as its broad serpentine 
body slowly emerged from the depths of the twisting nether within the 
portal. Midori answered with an enraged yell of frustration, though the 
crowd was too busy running away to really notice her. The stuttering 
young policewoman was sitting dazed on the ground staring up at the 
thing, and one suicidal reporter in particular was still standing in 
front of her camera team frantically chattering into the microphone as 
she gestured with her free arm to the beast behind her.

A van was already pulling up at the far side of the parking lot, on the 
other side of the building just visible behind all the chaos. Shizuru 
spotted it, and Midori spotted it too. Shizuru felt a sudden 
overwhelming urge to &quot;not be there&quot; very quickly, and preferably 
immediately. Right now.

Midori ignored the brunette woman hastily retreating into the relative 
safety of her own car and gave Reito another angry growl. &quot;Fucking 
thing...give it here!&quot; She whacked one fist hard against the side of the 
device, leaving a shallow dent in the already battered metal skin, but 
at last, the lights on the front end flickered to life. With a whining 
buzz the whole contraption juddered to a start and the three narrow 
prongs arrayed in a triangular pattern around the front nozzle began to 
rotate slowly, static crackling between them.

The creature screamed again, drawing Midori&#39;s attention back 
mid-ecstatic exclamation. By now it was almost completely free of the 
portal, which itself was shrinking away rapidly. It body, almost ten 
metres long in total, was covered in those same yellow plates 
interspersed by that same orange flesh, and a broad triple row of 
back-swept curved spines running along its back. Five narrow green eyes 
peered out from the gaps between the plates covering its facial area, 
and a slit opened in its head, pivoting open like a snake&#39;s jaw to 
reveal saliva-dripping fangs the size of meat cleavers.

&quot;Hurry up, damn it,&quot; urged the frustrated redhead to her would-be 
partner in crime. &quot;It&#39;s gonna get away already!&quot; She left him to his own 
devices, which hopefully he could tend to on his own, and rushed over to 
the young woman in the police uniform still sat on her backside gawping 
up at the terrifying vision above her.

&quot;What...w-w-w-what is that thing? Who...who are you?&quot;

Midori put a hand on the other woman&#39;s shoulder and tried to look as 
reassuring as she could. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. Everything&#39;s going to be fine, 
just stay right here.&quot;

&quot;Well Midori, you wanted nano-machines, you got yourself an eyewitness.&quot; 
Reito chuckled a tad ironically. &quot;And an Orphan in public...lucky girl.&quot; 
The machine in his hands started bleeping wildly at him, hogging his 
attention away from the immediate goings-on. Between that strange 
contraption, the Orphan and the terrified policewoman, nobody noticed 
the seven figures gathering in the nearby parking lot, all in bulky 
white body suits and carrying strange objects themselves.

Just when everyone though it was going to be one of those &quot;inexplicable 
strange thingy from another dimension eats a local policewoman&quot; stories, 
Armitage arrived. Not only did she arrive just in time, she arrived in 
style, just as she always did, because that was part of the job.

&quot;Stop right there!&quot; bellowed a commanding female voice.

The first thing the camera saw when it swung up towards the source of 
that voice were her boots, those thick, heavy metal green boots so 
reminiscent of some ancient medieval armour suit that sank into the 
concrete beneath her like it was sand under her feet, leaving the grey 
ledge shattered from her heavy landing. The cameraman panned up slowly, 
dramatically, though the fact that from that angle her skirt was 
slightly ineffective didn&#39;t hurt the matter. Unfortunately, the 
mysterious feminine figure was perched atop the hospital building itself 
just above the creature, with the sun behind her, eclipsing whatever hid 
beneath that skirt from view and making her a dramatic (not to mention 
rather curvaceous) silhouette on the camera&#39;s eye. By the time the light 
compensator kicked in, the green-garbed mystery woman had launched 
herself up into the air to come soaring down towards her apparent 
adversary with her fist cocked back behind her head, fingers glowing 
bright yellow.

&quot;Beware, vile creature!&quot; bellowed the mustard-haired heroine. &quot;I, 
Armitage, will not allow you to ferment this city&#39;s innocent 
inhabitants!&quot;

Somewhere nearby, Yukino put her hand to her face and sighed, 
&quot;Haruka-chan...&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The early evening air was surprisingly cool and gentle given how bright 
it still was outside, the midsummer sun streaming down through the thin 
cloud cover onto the city. A thick waft of steam billowed out of the 
bathhouse through the door as it opened, and out stepped Mai with a 
delightfully satisfied grin on her face. Mikoto was practically clinging 
to her arm, pouting harshly and making a terribly irritating whining 
noise. Her face was tinted a light pink right through her cheeks from 
all the hot water.

&quot;See, Mikoto-chan? I told you it&#39;d be fun!&quot;

The youngster pouted up at her elder and stuck out her tongue. Mai just 
chuckled and knocked Mikoto gently on the head with one balled-up hand.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t it feel better to be clean again? I bet you&#39;re glad really,&quot; 
she persisted in a most definitely jovial tone of voice, her lips curled 
into a rather feline smirk. She held the back of one hand over her mouth 
for a nice long yawn, her back arching upward, her eyes rolling 
momentarily shut. A quick bout of blinking followed to clear the sudden 
drowsiness from her head, her gaze wandering lazily up to the sky.

&quot;Wait...what&#39;s that?&quot;

Mikoto looked up at her curiously, cocking her head to one side. &quot;Eh?&quot;

Mai raised her hand and pointed a finger up into the sky at a small, 
dark blob silhouetted against the clouds. &quot;You see that, Mikoto-chan?&quot;

&quot;Hm?&quot; The young girl followed her finger along and stared for a while. 
After a moment or two, she tensed, her hands squeezing around the 
redhead&#39;s forearm. &quot;Orphan,&quot; she hissed.

Mai blinked again. &quot;What? But...so soon?&quot; She pouted, not too unlike the 
young black-haired girl&#39;s own expression barely a minute earlier and 
whined quietly. &quot;We just got done getting rid of one last night! Why 
can&#39;t we have a break for once?&quot;

To answer her question, so it would seem, Mikoto yelped and squeezed 
harder on her arm. &quot;Something else!&quot;

&quot;What? What is it?&quot;

&quot;A person! Someone...can&#39;t tell.&quot;

Mai looked down at her young charge with a serious expression. &quot;You 
mean...someone like us?&quot;

Mikoto nodded gravely. &quot;Think so...&quot;

She was interrupted by a rather tall and burly man of some 
inconsequential description barging past them along the street just in 
front of the bathhouse, carrying a large rectangular black bag slung 
from one shoulder. Mikoto yelped and Mai shouted angrily at the man, but 
only caught sight of the back of a long black overcoat before he turned 
down a nearby alleyway and disappeared.

&quot;Jeez...&quot; Mai turned up her nose in a show of displeasure. &quot;Some people 
are so inconsiderate these days.&quot;

Out of sight and out of earshot, where any wandering passer-by or 
certain important persons were unlikely to see or hear, the strange man 
let the bag fall to the paved ground and shuffled it up until it was 
half hidden between two large dumpsters parked in the alleyway. He 
reached into a pocket in his coat and withdrew a small square device 
with a screen and many very small buttons on one side. He pressed a few, 
and the screen lit up.

&quot;Scanner one in place,&quot; he muttered in a deep voice. &quot;Do we deploy?&quot;

&quot;Hold,&quot; the device hissed back at him. &quot;Hold until ordered. Be ready for 
immediate deploy.&quot;

&quot;Roger.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Excuse me, sir?&quot;

The man blinked. That certainly was one of, if not the, very strangest 
accents he had heard in a long time, to say the least. His brain 
actually took a few seconds to put all the syllables together to the 
point it all made sense.

&quot;Yes?&quot; he replied in his best formal introduction voice. &quot;How can I help 
you, miss?&quot;

The young red-haired girl in the cheap blue sweater and pastel skirt 
shuffled her white sock-clad feet from side to side a little as she 
looked up at the tall and very smartly dressed man before her. &quot;Well,&quot; 
she began hesitantly, &quot;I was just told to come to this place. She said 
we could stay here...&quot;

The porter shook his head. &quot;Dear me, I&#39;m afraid I really can&#39;t 
understand you...&quot;

Arika frowned, screwing up her face again. &quot;I&#39;m sorry but I...it&#39;s hard 
to...erm...&quot;

Her companion, a similarly youthful girl with dark navy blue hair, 
draped in a thick brown overcoat that reached down to her feet, put a 
hand to her forehead and groaned. &quot;Do you speak English, sir?&quot;

The porter let out a relieved exclamation. &quot;English! You speak English, 
yes, good! My English is...decent.&quot;

Nina nodded. &quot;Well then,&quot; she said, trying not to speak too quickly, &quot;we 
were told that we could stay here. What is this place exactly?&quot;

The suit-clad man gestured around himself to the clean, polished marble 
flooring and the wide bay windows, and all the ornate, decorative 
fixtures adorning a surprisingly expansive room. &quot;This is the lobby, 
miss,&quot; he explained. &quot;This is a hotel, of course. One of the best in the 
area, I might say.&quot; He gestured over to the huge semicircular desk in 
one corner of the lobby, at the handful of cheerful and similarly 
dressed staff chattering away to various customers. &quot;Are you here for a 
stay?&quot;

Arika nodded emphatically. &quot;We need a room, or two, or whatever! Just 
any place to stay for a while, that&#39;s all.&quot; She paused, holding a finger 
to her lips and humming in thought. &quot;Though...Miyu didn&#39;t really say how 
long we should stay, so I don&#39;t know...&quot;

Nina sighed and waved a dismissive hand to the porter, who was looking a 
touch lost with Arika&#39;s sudden rapid outburst. &quot;We&#39;d like a room please. 
Anything you can, as long as it&#39;s cheap.&quot; Arika nodded again, grinning 
widely and, she hoped, cute too. She could certainly do it when she 
tried.

The porter shook his head and gave a soft laugh. &quot;Well it all depends on 
how much you&#39;ve got, but I think we have some rooms empty.&quot;

Arika reached into her pocket and pulled out that short cardboard tube, 
from which she produced a whole roll of notes. The porter went a little 
wide-eyed and then started gesturing wildly.

&quot;Wait miss, now...I get the feeling this isn&#39;t quite what it looks 
like.&quot; He shot a questioning look towards Nina, who winced slightly.

&quot;We&#39;re...new here.&quot; She took the wad of money from her companion, 
ignoring the pouting and the yipping that brought, and showed it to the 
man. &quot;How much is this anyway?&quot;

&quot;Better than enough for a room,&quot; he replied, smiling reassuringly. &quot;You 
could rent one for a whole week if you&#39;re lucky. I&#39;ll go and find a 
cheap one for you.&quot; With that he bowed politely to the two young girls 
and then strode off over to the reception desk in the corner, leaving 
Nina to collapse back against Arika&#39;s side with a deep breath. Arika 
yelped and flailed to catch the darker-haired girl in her arms before 
they both fell over, holding tight to keep Nina on her feet.

One of the receptions staff, a modestly attractive brunette woman in her 
late twenties, or so she would seem, smiled knowingly up at the porter. 
&quot;I see you made two more friends, Take-kun.&quot;

&quot;Takeshi, you&#39;re too much of a nice guy,&quot; interjected a considerably 
younger man from the other end of the desk, smirking mischievously. &quot;I 
told you to stay away from those two.&quot;

The porter replied with his own all-knowing grin. &quot;And I told you that 
there was something unusual going on, didn&#39;t I?&quot; He turned to spare a 
quick look back at the two girls, now wandering across the lobby towards 
bar area where the orange-haired girl was guiding the purple-haired girl 
into a chair. &quot;Dressed in something like that, any of you lot would have 
just kicked her out. But I know when something&#39;s a-miss.&quot;

The receptionist shook her head, giggling amusedly, and switched back to 
her typing.

&quot;So then, my dear Rumiko, could you see if any of the second storey rear 
rooms are empty?&quot;

&quot;You mean the really cheap ones, yeah?&quot; She suppressed another laugh as 
her fingers flew over the keypad with practiced expertise. &quot;Well, we do 
have one or two left. Two-seven-eight and two-nine-five. I dunno...you 
want both?&quot;

The porter shook his head. &quot;I think they&#39;d prefer to stay together, 
somehow. Call it just intuition.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;d make you a mother yet, Takeshi?&quot; There followed another brief 
round of laughter across the desk, to which Takeshi himself only grinned 
and bowed again, as he always did, running a hand over his slicked-back 
short silver hair. The receptionist tapped away a little more and then 
finally, from one small slot in a whole array of them set into the very 
surface of the desk beside her, out popped a thick plastic card no 
larger than a few centimetres along each side. The porter snapped it 
between forefinger and thumb before she could reach for it and held it 
up to his face.

&quot;Thank you so much, dear Rumiko. I think I owe you again for this.&quot;

With that he dashed back to his two would-be clients, effortlessly 
concealing his haste with years of practice. Arika was puzzled, but 
happy to bow until she started feeling dizzy while Nina took the card 
for herself in exchange for a measly few hundred yen.

&quot;I have arranged your room for the night. If you want to stay longer, 
just call the front desk and you can pay when you leave.&quot; Nina nodded 
affirmative and thanked the man quite briskly then moved to stand. The 
attempt did not quite go as planned, but Arika was at her side before 
she knew it and slender, sturdy arms winding about her body helped to 
lift her up to her feet with little difficulty. The pair followed the 
porter to an elevator and then together navigated the corridors of the 
hotel until they found their designated room.

It was a small room, perhaps, but not too different from the room they 
had shared at Garderobe, along with a whole other person. The d&eacute;cor was 
rich and warm, and pleasant on the eyes as with many hotels, and the 
lighting was bright but not too sharp. No window, but where one may have 
been was instead a wide watercolour painting of some random landscape 
that both girls found a tad odd; so lush and green, a thick forest of 
tall trees and overgrown bushes, gentle hills covered in green grass and 
a towering green snow-capped mountain as the centre point. Nina found 
herself wondering for a moment if it was really a fictitious landscape, 
or where, if not, it might be. Nowhere in the WindBloom kingdom, or 
Artai for that matter. There was a sliding door to a surprisingly large 
closet, empty of course, and another door that lead through to an 
impressive bathroom suite.

And one bed.

&quot;They only gave us one bed...&quot;

Arika poked her elbow playfully against her companion&#39;s ribs. &quot;Not like 
you actually said &quot;two beds please&quot; or anything. How were they supposed 
to know?&quot;

Nina glared at her, but she ignored it and dove straight onto the thick, 
sumptuous purple covers. &quot;What, they thought we were sisters?&quot;

&quot;Or maybe they think we&#39;re...&quot; Arika giggled. &quot;You&#39;re so boring, 
Nina-chan.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; argued the dark-haired girl, blushing slightly. &quot;As if 
I&#39;d...with you, of all people...&quot;

&quot;Ow.&quot;

Nina blinked. &quot;Hm?&quot;

&quot;That hurt...&quot; Arika didn&#39;t move, or turn to face her, but her shoulders 
were taught as she lay face-down on the bed. &quot;You&#39;re so cold sometimes, 
Nina-chan.&quot;

&quot;I...er...I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean...I didn&#39;t think you...&quot;

The redhead waved dismissively and then patted the bed space beside 
herself. &quot;Just shut up and come get some sleep already. I don&#39;t know 
about you but I&#39;m exhausted.&quot;

Nina frowned. &quot;Only if you keep your fingers to yourself.&quot;

Arika grinned over her shoulder and wiggled her fingers at the other 
girl, who shrank back slightly at the sight. &quot;Only if you need it, 
Nina-chan. I think it&#39;s the only time I&#39;ve really seen you laugh.&quot;

Nina turned her nose up petulantly. &quot;I laugh. You just never it see 
because I don&#39;t laugh near you, you foolish young girl.&quot; She turned away 
and hung up the heavy brown coat that they had scrounged out of a 
dumpster onto one of the hooks by the door. Then on second thought, she 
unhooked the thing and tossed it into the large empty hamper in the 
corner beside the bathroom door.

The cool breeze from the air conditioning unit was suddenly chill 
against her skin, naked as she was under the coat, having had her 
clothes destroyed long ago and that green cloth thing long gone. She 
wrapped her arms around herself and shivered, until a second pair joined 
them without warning, pulling her back against another warm body.

&quot;Arika...&quot; she tried to protest, but it just trailed off. So cold and 
tired, such wasn&#39;t really the time to be protesting offered hospitality. 
She wriggled her way round to face the other girl and returned the 
gesture, her arms fitting around Arika&#39;s waist in a way that seemed 
almost...comfortable.

&quot;Nina-chan, please, you need to rest. You&#39;re still weak.&quot; The redhead&#39;s 
voice was soft and entreating in tone, and her eyes showed her concern 
clear as day when she looked down. Nina found her resolve melting away.

&quot;Okay,&quot; she surrendered finally. &quot;Let&#39;s just...go to bed, yeah...&quot;

&quot;I promise,&quot; replied Arika, &quot;my hands will stay where they belong.&quot;

Nina nodded. &quot;Right...right where they are now...I think...&quot;

And that was that.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Not too much later that very same night, the air above the city was a 
dark tempest of swirling clouds that crackled and spat lightning in 
thick sheets across the sky, a nebulous whirlpool of malevolent power 
that formed the condensed masses of water into an upward-stretching 
spiral. The massive storm-cloud that hung over the city was being 
twisted and reshaped by some nameless force, unbeknownst to the citizens 
below, until it was a towering spire reaching up into the stratosphere. 
Just below the base of that huge tower, blinding bright bursts of pale 
yellow smashed and hammered against an ominous spot of deep thrumming 
orange, answered occasionally by thin slashes of flame that raced across 
the skies in wide, sweeping arcs. A news helicopter circled low over the 
city, battered downward by the torrential rains and an inexplicably 
strong wind that seemed to be blowing straight down.

&quot;Hey! Would ya watch where you&#39;re pointin&#39; that thing, woman!&quot; The pilot 
leant over to one side up against the thick glass that made up the 
cockpit side, away from the handheld microphone being waved dangerously 
in his direction.

&quot;Shut up,&quot; barked the newscaster herself, straightening herself back 
into her seat and adjusting her tie. &quot;Just try not to crash into 
anything.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got thirty seconds, Yomi,&quot; said the man behind the camera in 
that unnervingly calm voice he always used. &quot;Now isn&#39;t the time for 
worrying about your outfit.&quot; She gave him a sarcastic smile in return 
and flicked her thick brown hair back over her shoulder again.

&quot;Iwata, check the outboard cam again.&quot;

&quot;Hey, trust me, it&#39;s fine. I know what I&#39;m doing.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;

Iwata gave her a very firm look that left no room for any more protests. 
She frowned and let out a resigned sigh just as the little red light 
flickered to life on the side of the camera. The voice of her director 
came storming into her left ear like a freight train rushing past so 
loud that she could hear perfectly despite not having the earpiece in 
place. She always did hate how those things looked on camera, after all. 
Hers spent most of its life tucked behind her ear out of sight where she 
could hear the director just fine, not that she usually listened to the 
idiot anyway.

Bureaucrat.

&quot;Good evening ladies and gentlemen,&quot; she said in her most formal voice, 
effortlessly masking over her own emotions. &quot;Up here, in the skies above 
Tokyo city, a most disturbing event is unfolding that even the 
scientific community of Japan is having trouble explaining away. Some 
have theorised that this is, in fact, some sort of freak natural 
occurrence, or perhaps an artificially caused meteorological 
phenomenon.&quot;

Iwata flicked a few switches and the camera feed swapped over, leaving 
Yomi only seconds to move, still talking, to her next position kneeling 
right beside the wide glass door of the craft.

&quot;As you can see, the sky directly overhead is an impenetrable shell of 
cloud, dark enough to blind even the best of pilots and all but 
extinguish the already meagre starlight Tokyo receives on the clearest 
of nights. There appears to be some kind of cyclone system forming in 
the sky, however irrational it may seem, upside-down over the city.&quot;

Another flick of a switch and the masses were treated to a first-class 
view out of the door of the helicopter, looking out over the Tokyo 
skyline towards the epicentre of that tremendous storm cloud some few 
short kilometres away, where the &#39;lightning&#39; was at its brightest and 
most colourful.

&quot;What has many people worried is this, you see before you now; it 
appears to be some kind of electrical discharge that defies most of what 
Japan&#39;s meteorological experts know about lightning in its many forms. 
The closest anyone has come so far is the notion that, perhaps, this is 
simply an aggravated and confused natural weather pattern affected by 
the unnatural pressure systems that flow over the manmade structures 
below. The lightning is branching out in all directions, but for now 
there appears to be no danger to anyone on the ground. Indeed, even the 
tallest buildings have stood so far witho-&quot;

She broke off.

The director started yelling in her ear, but she wasn&#39;t listening. She 
was signalling frantically behind her back to her cameraman, off-camera, 
while she held a pair of motorised binoculars up to her face with the 
other hand. Iwata looked confused at first but soon found what it was 
that appeared to have grasped his co-worker&#39;s attention so viciously and 
zoomed the camera rapidly in on it.

&quot;A girl,&quot; said the newscaster to herself in an astonished whisper. She 
cleared her throat, shaking the note of startled wonder from her voice 
as she held the microphone back up to her mouth and clicked it on.

&quot;A girl,&quot; she declared firmly, ignoring that pest of a voice buzzing 
behind her ear. Screw jumping to conclusions. &quot;That&#39;s right, ladies and 
gentlemen, you really are seeing this. Up in the skies above Tokyo city, 
an unidentified girl, throwing what appears to be bolts of lightning as 
if they were sheets of paper...&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Haruka was oblivious to the helicopter, or the young newswoman therein 
whom she had at least several years over, calling her a &quot;girl&quot; of all 
things. She was too busy kicking some serious ass.

That was the best part of being Armitage. Yes, admittedly, living as the 
successful and incredibly wealthy owner of one of the largest business 
firms in Japan was impressive, and being her ravishingly beautiful self 
was not without its rewards however hard it was to maintain, but nothing 
compared to Armitage. Armitage was power, and pride, and an attitude 
that nothing could silence. Armitage didn&#39;t take shit from anyone for 
anything, and that was just the way she liked it. But most of all:

Armitage was a smack down with a ten-ton truck.

The overkill, that was what she loved the most, the sheer gratuitous 
excess. The way in which any threat, any opponent, was dealt with in 
exactly the same way; she blasted the ever-living crap out of it. 
Armitage was an unstoppable avatar of righteous vengeance, the burning 
fist of justice. Her fury was the sun, incinerating everything in its 
path.

Those stupid Orphans never stood a chance.

The snake beast screamed at her again and she threw yet another enormous 
bolt of energy at the thing with an enraged bellow of her own. Like a 
solid beam as thick as her thigh it jumped from her outstretched fist to 
the creature, connecting faster than the eye could follow and bringing 
forth a blinding splash of yellowish light that temporarily obscure her 
opponent from view. The scream it gave, much more discordant than 
before, gave her immense satisfaction.

From the foaming cloud of smoke that had engulfed the Orphan issued 
forth several long, curving jets of flame that arced through the air 
towards her, closing in from all around, even above and below her. In a 
heartbeat, she was a sitting duck, with countless trails of fire racing 
to meet her and torch her alive, or so it might have seemed. The attack 
broke across an invisible shell that encapsulated her from head to foot 
and left the mighty Armitage unscathed and laughing contemptuously at 
her foe, arms crossed over (rather, under) her expansive chest.

&quot;You&#39;re no match for me, you foolish beast!&quot; Her voice was as bold and 
commanding as ever, even though the Orphan could likely not understand 
her at all. Japanese-speaking aliens; who ever heard of such a thing? 
Instead of boasting, as she usually did, her tone became an agitated 
demand. &quot;You can&#39;t win against the power of Armitage! What is it you 
want here? Did you come to make a few pretty little patterns in the sky 
or are you on some sort of mission?&quot;

The creature did not answer her, not that she had really expected one, 
nor did it take advantage of her pause as they most often did. Haruka 
felt her irritation growing ever larger as the thing continued to stare 
her down, tiny jolts of electricity snapping across its scaled body in 
spasmodic patterns. The tingling feeling creeping across her skin was 
beginning to grow stronger, though whether it was her exerting herself 
so far or the lightning in the air remained unanswered.

&quot;Fine!&quot; she yelled at it, flashing her trademark &#39;insane wrath&#39; grin at 
the Orphan. &quot;I&#39;ll just have to blow you into a million tiny pieces and 
then interrogate what&#39;s left!&quot;

She clenched her left hand into a fist, the muscles in her forearm, 
usually hidden beneath lightly tanned skin, bulging impressively. 
Blowing it up wasn&#39;t working, so it was time for the hands-on approach. 
Her body darted forward at something approaching the speed of sound, 
leaving shockwave in the air behind her, and her arm bent back beside 
her head to deliver a good solid punch right on that annoying snake&#39;s 
face.

At the last second, the Orphan turned its attention up towards the 
clouds overhead and started squirming its way up through the air at a 
startling speed. Its whole body was crackling with static and the horn 
on the prow of its serpentine head was giving off a soft blue glow. 
Haruka shot straight past it and was some distance away before she could 
stop and turn back towards it, blinking confusedly.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; she cursed under her breath and sent herself flying after the 
thing at top speed. &quot;Bastard!&quot; she yelled at it. &quot;Get back here! I&#39;m not 
finished with you yet!&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The sound of a soft, muffled whisper seeped in through the foggy black 
haze of unconsciousness and brushed at the edges of a tired and 
disoriented mind. The mind in question responded by twitching a few 
extremities before sending slow, cautious impulses down its associated 
arms. They tried to move, but found themselves caught around something 
large, at least as wide as their owner&#39;s own body; or more precisely, 
they were wrapped about something. A pair of deep, golden orange eyes 
rolled lethargically open. The first thing they saw was moonlight, pale 
and silvery, and the soft yellow-orange glow of artificial light 
trickling in through the gap between thick red curtains drawn shut 
across a sliding glass door. The door appeared not quite firmly closed 
and a gentle night breeze blew one side of the curtain lazily back and 
forth, dragging across the carpeted floor with a hushed rustling noise. 
As they wafted ajar, a balcony came into view beyond the door, not much 
more than large enough for one person and lined by narrow black metal 
railings less than a metre high.

Nina blinked slowly, once then twice, shifting her body slightly to one 
side as she unfolded her upper arm from where it lay draped across the 
person-sized lump resting in bed beside her. Her lower arm stayed where 
it was, trapped between the bed and that familiar figure, as she shook 
the drowsiness from her head. The thin, short bowl of her emery black 
hair fell down behind her head to brush against her naked shoulders, and 
a shiver ran through her when another draught sent chill midnight air 
racing about her exposed back and sides; still she sat up as far as she 
could without extricating her arm for where it stayed, snug and warm.

On the balcony, silhouetted against the light streaming in from outside, 
was a modestly tall dark figure of some description. The most prominent 
features were thick, high-topped boots that stretched up the figure&#39;s 
calves quite a distance, along with a huge, wide brimmed hat that cast a 
shadow on most of the person&#39;s body as well as creating a vast expanse 
of darkness on the floor behind. The rest of the figure was shrouded by 
a long cloak garment that reached almost to the ankles, wafting slowly 
in the breeze just as did the curtains.

&quot;W...&quot; Nina tried to speak, but her throat choked up and she coughed 
instead. Her free hand went at once to cover her mouth, stifling her 
hacking, lest her outbursts wake the redheaded girl sleeping peacefully 
by her side. The muscles under her ribs and all across her left side 
still ached unbearably as they had all through the previous day, but 
that pain had lost its sharp edge at least. When she finally had her 
breathing back under control, she cleared her throat and gave another 
attempt.

&quot;Who are you,&quot; she prompted firmly of the unidentified figure on the 
balcony. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

The figure turned slowly towards her, sliding the glass door fully open 
once again. Those thick, solid boots sounded heavy on the thin carpet as 
the figure stepped into the room, darkness still obscuring any facial 
features. Nina was too busy looking hesitantly about the room in which 
she now lay to pay too much heed as that figure turned to stand at the 
foot of the bed, not more than a metre or so from the balcony door.

&quot;Where are we?&quot; Nina inquired of the silent intruder, her tone growing a 
touch more imperative. &quot;This isn&#39;t the same room...what did you do?&quot;

&quot;I moved you,&quot; replied an easily recognisable voice somewhere between 
softly feminine and deeply masculine, firm and cold yet gentle and 
reassuring in some strange way. &quot;Had they come for you, I would not have 
been able to get you both out in time. I needed an alternate entrance.&quot; 
Nina beat her free hand against the bed as hard as she could, though 
only a soft whuff of air issued forth in protest, thankfully nothing 
loud enough as to even threaten the other girl&#39;s peaceful slumber.

&quot;You-&quot; she cut off with something of a start, turning her head quickly 
to the sleeping Arika. Apparently, her raised tone of voice had not 
broken through the redhead&#39;s deep unconscious state, for she snored 
softly on to herself yet. &quot;You have a lot of explaining to do,&quot; Nina 
reaffirmed considerably more subdued than before, &quot;Miss...whoever you 
are... Well for one thing, who are you anyway? And where is this place?&quot;

&quot;I am Miyu.&quot;

Nina cocked an eyebrow curiously. &quot;So you say your name is Miyu. Then 
you&#39;re that woman we saw earlier, in the alley?&quot;

Miyu shook her head almost unnoticeably and repeated, stressing the 
words in what Nina thought was an uncomfortable sounding manner, &quot;I am 
Miyu.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Nina relented uneasily, &quot;Miyu-san...where are we?&quot;

Miyu paused for quite a long few moments, the dark void that covered her 
face concealing any expressions that might be flickering to hint at her 
underlying emotion, though knowing Miyu none would anyway. Her voice was 
the same flat, deep, and somehow emotive tone it always was when she 
answered quite simply, &quot;Earth.&quot;

&quot;Earth?&quot; Nina looked around her again at the darkened room, bemusement 
on her face. &quot;But...&quot;

&quot;Not the Earth with which you are familiar, Nina-san,&quot; interrupted the 
enigmatic woman before Nina could ask any further questions. Her face 
turned ever so slightly to the young girl&#39;s side. &quot;Do you remember the 
Black Valley, Yumemiya-san?&quot;

&quot;I think so,&quot; came Arika&#39;s voice, sleepy and dazed though it was, from 
just beside and behind Nina&#39;s shoulder, startling her considerably. The 
redhead brought both hands to her face to rub her eyes awake, yawning 
hugely. Nina&#39;s arm drifted downward back towards her side but, 
surprisingly, Arika turned her head to the dark-haired girl with an odd 
expression when she noticed the movement and reached out to take Nina&#39;s 
hand in her own. She drew that arm back up, until it was draped across 
behind her shoulders, and then leaned slightly into the other girl so 
that her shoulder nudged Nina&#39;s chest.

Nina flushed slightly, and was thankful nobody could see it through the 
darkness. Try as she might though, she couldn&#39;t stop her hand from 
drifting back down to where it had been before, settled on Arika&#39;s far 
hip. Where it was more...comfortable.

&quot;The Black Valley is like an island caught between dimensions, stretched 
across the boundary separating one world from another. Either world can 
pass into the Valley, and then out the other side into another 
dimension.&quot;

&quot;Wait...&quot; Nina felt her eyebrows knotting together in the middle of her 
forehead, but what was said actually seemed to be making sense. &quot;So 
we&#39;re not on Earth...but some...other Earth?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Miyu simply, in that oh so final way she had of doing so. 
&quot;You have passed from your own world to a different one, where Earth has 
not expanded out into space yet, and technology has not advanced as far 
as it has on your planet.&quot;

&quot;Miyu,&quot; began Arika, but Nina interrupted,

&quot;But then how did we get here? The last thing I can remember, we 
were...&quot; she trailed off.

&quot;I brought you both.&quot; Miyu turned to face the balcony again, leaving her 
face in profile as she tipped her head back until moonlight was free to 
wash in under the rim of her hat and illuminate her features at last. 
&quot;You were needed here, so I was forced to bring you.&quot;

&quot;Miyu,&quot; Arika repeated imploringly, &quot;you keep saying &quot;your world&quot;...&quot; 
She paused. The question hung on the tip of her tongue. It was such a 
foolish thing to ask, certainly, but from the worried look on her face, 
Arika already knew the answer. &quot;...but it&#39;s yours too, isn&#39;t it Miyu?&quot;

Miyu shook her head slowly from side to side, letting the fedora shroud 
her face once more. &quot;I am not of your world. This world, this reality, 
this is my home.&quot;

Silence reined for a long while, the two young girls sitting a little 
uncomfortably on the bed side by side, looking hesitantly at one another 
with similar confused expressions hidden in the darkness. After what 
seemed like forever, Nina finally broke through the awkward pause, 
turning her attention back to the black-robed figure, &quot;Miyu-san...&quot;

Miyu was gone, empty air where but moments before had stood that 
mysterious blue-haired woman. The night breeze wafted the curtains back 
and forth through the open balcony door.

Nina let out a heavy sigh, a slightly agitated sound. &quot;Does she expect 
us to just sit here in this room forever then? What are we doing here? 
Surely there must be some reason she brought us here in the first 
place...&quot;

Arika&#39;s arm around her lower back gave a comforting squeeze. &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry, Nina,&quot; she said in an unexpectedly tender voice. &quot;I&#39;m sure 
Miyu-san knows what she&#39;s doing. I trust her not to put us in danger if 
she can help it.&quot;

&quot;Hey... What did you call me?&quot; Nina responded after a considerably 
lengthy pause.

Arika smiled not quite nervously up at her, still leaning into the 
dark-haired girl&#39;s side. &quot;What&#39;s wrong, Nina? Did I say something 
wrong?&quot;

Nina turned her nose up slightly and averted her gaze. &quot;Just...nothing.&quot; 
She almost left it at that, but something was just screaming at her to 
be a little more forthcoming and she eventually relented. 
&quot;Just...thinking of fa-Sergei...&quot; she corrected herself.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Nina looked back down at the redhead leaning limp against her, cradled 
in her arm. &quot;What?&quot; She shook her head slowly. &quot;You haven&#39;t done 
anything wrong, Arika...I just...&quot; She trailed off again.

A hand grasped at her shoulder, turning her to face the other girl as 
Arika leaned up until their faces were level.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...Ni-na.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say that...&quot;

Arika&#39;s thin, delicate young lips twitched into a half-smirk as one 
finger traced a slow, lazy pattern across the other girl&#39;s upper chest, 
gradually wandering lower.

&quot;Ni...na...&quot;

The way her lips moved as the sounds drifted out, barely a whisper, as 
if her tongue caressed every nuance as it went. She was clearly enjoying 
it. One more time, her mouth spread open the very slightest way and the 
tip of that narrow pink tongue peeked out as it curled up behind her top 
teeth...

&quot;Ni...&quot;

Nina shot her a suddenly amused look. &quot;Go back to sleep already, 
Arinko.&quot;

&quot;Sergei used to call me that,&quot; replied Arika in an almost sensuous tone.

Before any questions could be asked, the redhead let herself fall onto 
her back again with a soft thump and her arm around Nina&#39;s waist pulled 
the other girl down with her, so they lay once more side by side. In 
place of the usual mischievous comment that Nina might have expected, 
there was only silence, a puzzlingly relaxing, contented sort of 
silence. As Arika&#39;s eyes drifted shut again, her smile shifted from 
amusement to satisfaction.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Outside, somewhere nearby on a deserted rooftop, high above street 
level, that dark figure stood solemnly at the corner straddling a high 
metal railing, looking out over the cityscape with shocking red eyes. 
Her face was as flat and calm as ever, but her eyes gave subtle hint to 
the tumultuous emotions roiling and foaming beneath her placid surface.

&quot;I lied,&quot; she said to no one, her voice filled with regret. 
&quot;Yumemiya-san trusts me with her life...and I lied to her.&quot;

The small yellow bird perched atop her left shoulder turned its head in 
an almost human manner and twittered at her excitedly.

&quot;No, I understand, Miss, but...&quot; She repeated, as if in answer this 
time, &quot;I lied. I lied to both of them... Because they must not know the 
truth, is that it Miss? Isn&#39;t that what you wanted? All this is so that 
they can still lead normal lives, if they survive...&quot;

The little bird twittered some more, chirping away in its melodious 
little voice, and Miyu seemed to listen intently to what it had to say. 
She nodded almost imperceptibly in response.

&quot;I tried to tell them the truth,&quot; she answered after a moment&#39;s more 
silence. Her eyes turned down to glance at her hand for a moment as she 
spoke. &quot;How can something so artificial have a name to begin with...?&quot;

The little bird squawked furiously at her all of a sudden, chattering 
agitatedly and hopping about on her shoulder, flapping its wings at her. 
She lifted a hand to offer a comforting touch to its head, but it 
refused, batting the offered fingers away with its wings and squawking 
still.

&quot;Please, Miss...I know you don&#39;t like it when I say it, but it is the 
truth. I do not deserve a human name, after all.&quot; Miyu slowly let her 
eyes drift shut, and her face relaxed again from the tense expression it 
had grown to back to its natural emotionless state. The little bird was 
still warbling away angrily as she spoke again, in a much softer, more 
soothing tone of voice, &quot;please, Miss. I promise, I won&#39;t mention it 
again. I pro-&quot;

There was a sharp hiss.

The little yellow bird leapt up and fluttered into the air as Miyu 
hunched forward violently, her hands grasping at the metal railing to 
keep herself from falling. Her fingers tightened with such force that 
the rusted old metal bars twisted and deformed under her touch, like 
warmed plastic. Panicked warbling filled the air, that little yellow 
bird circling frantically above the woman, now kneeling, as a cloud of 
luminescent blue steam emitted from the back of her neck in several 
thick puffs.

Her mind was boiling. Her brain was exploding inside her head, frying 
the inside of her skull and everything else within, including itself. 
Her vision turned blue and violet, and red, then orange, then green, all 
the different colours she could name and many she couldn&#39;t, cycling 
through them all one after the other at ever-increasing speeds. Her 
consciousness was being sucked away, one tiny piece at a time, nibbled 
at by a thousand angry wasps. It was agony, and it was unstoppable, and 
it was terrifying. Images, sounds, scents...memories she had almost 
forgotten she even had came rushing to the surface as they one by one 
dissolved before her eyes; memories of a mysterious man towering over 
her prone body, of voices all around her in the darkness, of how cold 
snow was...

...a tall, young golden-haired woman, standing in the snow...

She grabbed that one with all her might and forced it away somewhere 
deep inside, where the pain couldn&#39;t find it and destroy it.

Then, the world faded away into dark silence.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Several hundred metres more or less directly up, much was afoot.

Haruka recoiled swiftly through the air away from her opponent, 
clutching a hand tightly against the side of her arm. Blood seeped 
through the narrow gaps between her fingers, trickled down the back of 
her hand in thin rivulets, down along her forearm, and dripped off her 
other elbow. It stung like hell, sure, but it was still pitifully 
shallow a wound; a paper cut in the face of a raging angry bull. 
Ultimately, it only made her even more pissed off.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; she yelled at the Orphan, again, &quot;you really don&#39;t want to 
make me any madder!&quot;

The Orphan replied with another fresh burst of razor-thin flaming shafts 
that lanced out towards her like flailing tendrils, lashing and writhing 
through the air, each one missing by a comfortable margin thanks to 
Armitage&#39;s incredible agility. She slid from side to side effortlessly, 
and whatever didn&#39;t miss completely broke apart against the thick, 
glowing yellow transparency that manifested in front of her as a shield.

The second the attack ended, Haruka answered in kind with one hand 
stretched towards the creature, fingers spread, yellow light glowing at 
their tips. Energy leapt from her fingertips in rapid fire, thin yellow 
beams that snapped through the air and scorched deep, smouldering pits 
into the surface of those thick armoured plates that covered the snake 
creature&#39;s hide. It screamed and thrashed, and tried to evade, but 
dodging bolts of light is, as any physicist will attest to, practically 
impossible at such short range.

Haruka&#39;s face twisted from angry to wicked delight and the glow 
surrounding her fingers swelled. Pale yellow turned lighter, whiter, 
those narrow shafts of light smashing into the Orphan&#39;s scales like 
miniature nuclear explosives. The screaming grew and grew until it was 
almost deafening, and still Armitage attacked. Her opponent was in 
agony, and it was losing, and that was a damned good thing.

Lightning crackled wildly just a few metres overhead, drowning out 
everything and almost deafening Haruka herself, and leaving the air 
tingling with static. The tips of her fingers felt like they&#39;d been 
pressed against a hot grill, burnt and sore. She swore, loudly and 
creatively, and then started channelling energy back into her other 
hand.

&quot;Stupid fucking lightning,&quot; she yelled at...well, who knows, really? She 
looked up, at the swirling storm clouds above, and shook her fist. 
&quot;Whose side are you on here, anyway!&quot;

As if in reply, the wind that had been all night long trying to batter 
her down to the ground...stopped. The rain ceased, as abruptly as if 
someone had simply flicked a switch. Lightning still crackled and spat 
as it ran all about the surface of the cloud, and from deep within 
thunder still rumbled, almost like some sort of huge reaction were 
taking place concealed inside that thick black shroud. The strange 
tingling sensation crawling all over her bare skin, static building in 
the air, it was getting thicker and stronger by the second. It was like 
being jammed between two giant electrodes.

She turned back to the Orphan, ever angrier, and yelled at it again, 
&quot;What are you planning, damn it!&quot; It answered with a scream.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mikoto stood perched at the very edge, leaning out over the precipice 
without hint of trepidation. Her bare feet shifted against the soaking 
concrete ledge, slapping wetly as she swapped her weight from one side 
to the other and back again.

&quot;Mikoto!&quot; Mai looked somewhere between furious and distraught, dashing 
across the roof towards the young girl. She was still panting slightly 
from the sudden rush up so many flights of stairs in such a hurry. She 
ran out at full head and didn&#39;t stop until she was within reaching 
distance of her young charge, upon which she keeled forward violently 
and put both hands on the sturdy grey stone ledge and panted heavily.

&quot;I&#39;m...not as fit as...I thought,&quot; she heaved between breaths, trying to 
laugh self-consciously and failing. Mikoto didn&#39;t seem to be paying much 
attention though; the girl&#39;s face was turned up to the sky above and her 
eyes narrowed, unblinking, focused on the bright flashing specks 
fluttering wildly about under the thick cloud cover.

&quot;I have to go,&quot; she announced resolutely. &quot;I have to stop it.&quot;

&quot;Damn it, Mikoto, get down from there right now!&quot; When the girl bluntly 
refused to reply, Mai hissed and bashed one fist angrily against the 
concrete ledge.

The young girl turned her head back to look over her shoulder, showing a 
most determined expression on her face. Her features were hard set, 
steadfast against Mai&#39;s protest; the redhead found her arguments quickly 
dissolving in futility.

&quot;I have to protect Mai,&quot; declared Mikoto just as tenacious as before. 
She turned her gaze back up to the sky, and the narrow tails of her hair 
wafted dramatically out behind her from her head, the thin white shirt 
wrapped about her ruffling in the breeze. &quot;I have to stop them, or 
they&#39;ll hurt Mai. I can&#39;t let anyone...I can&#39;t let that happen...not 
ever...&quot;

&quot;Mikoto...&quot; The older woman shook her head frantically, her eyes 
stinging with a mixture of the sharp chill in the air and sudden 
bewilderment. &quot;What are you talking about, Mikoto? You&#39;re talking 
like...&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t remember,&quot; interrupted Mikoto, rounding on her with that same 
resolved expression on her face, amber eyes gleaming. &quot;You&#39;ve 
forgotten.&quot;

&quot;Remember...remember what?&quot;

Mikoto blinked. &quot;I remember...I...remember...&quot; She shook her head from 
side to side dismissively. &quot;I remember! I know...who... Mai, don&#39;t you 
remember? Don&#39;t...don&#39;t you know...&quot; Confusion replaced obstinacy as her 
eyes darted about from her hands to her feet, to her makeshift guardian.

&quot;Mikoto, you&#39;re not making any sense!&quot;

A flash of blindingly bright light splashed across the roof, 
illuminating everything in sharp contrast for barely a second before 
fading away again. A few moments later, there came a most terrific 
crashing boom, like the ground was splitting apart. A second flash of 
lightning came not too long after, then a third, followed by more 
deafening thunder behind it. Mai looked up towards the source of all 
that light and noise with a curious expression, as did her young 
companion too.

At the base of the colossal towering cloud structure, a minute shape was 
forming; a disk of shining golden-red and orange and yellow, roiling 
like flames. At the sight of it, Mai felt her head throbbing inside.

It was...familiar.

The ocean crashing up against the rocks far below, sprayed thick white 
foam up in hissing sheets that leapt up over the cliff-side and showered 
over those assembled like a heavy rain. The air was a raging beast, 
sweeping and diving like some terrible invisible monster trying to claw 
the cliff apart. Out across the sea, lights flickered on the horizon. 
Thin trails of white smoke arced up into the air and dashed across the 
sky towards the coast...

Mai felt her knees trembling under her. Her heart was pounding furiously 
in her chest, and her head was ringing like there was a bell stuck over 
it and someone was bashing away with a hammer. Her fingers clenched up 
tightly until her nails stung her palms.

&quot;Don&#39;t get the wrong idea! Nothing happened here!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s insane!&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no need to go running into a conflict. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a 
way...&quot;

&quot;Why resist it? This is the purpose for which you were created!&quot;

Words in her head, all jumbled up, all racing around inside her mind at 
different speeds, all yelling at her at once. It was deafening. Her 
hands went to her head reflexively and her knees gave out without 
warning, dropping her down to the concrete roof with a soft thump. 
Mikoto jumped down from her ledge and started yelping at her in a panic, 
but she couldn&#39;t hear anything past the roar of voices in her brain.

Up high in the sky, beneath a beautiful cloudy blue sunset, a huge plain 
of fire erupted from nowhere. The air split open and flames poured out 
like water. The heat was tremendous. Writhing from out of that eternal 
fiery hell came the figure of an immense dragon, a legless winged beast 
all in white and wreathed in flame, with many eyes hidden about its 
head, and a huge dagger embedded through its snout.

The God of Destruction.

Kagutsuchi.

Mai&#39;s head was ready to explode, and still it wouldn&#39;t stop. Her body 
rolled forward until her forehead touched the soaking concrete.

&quot;Get out,&quot; she mumbled, deliriously. Her voice broke as she screamed 
out, &quot;get out of my head!&quot;

The fire was all around, still consuming what few trees left standing. 
Where there had been before a thick patch of forest, now was a clearing, 
scorched and barren earth around a huge elongated crater that still 
glowed with incredible heat.

Mai looked down at the ground from her perch atop the great dragon&#39;s 
shoulder and saw no sign of the young girl.

&quot;This doesn&#39;t make sense!&quot; Mai&#39;s voice was turning hoarse from her 
screaming already, mostly an inarticulate wailing that overcame her body 
whenever her awareness was consumed within yet another bewildering 
vision. There was blood and skin under her fingernails and the palms of 
both hands stung unbearably.

&quot;You killed him!&quot;

Mikoto looked up at her with a dead expression on her face.

&quot;Eh?&quot;

&quot;You killed Takumi!&quot;

Unstoppable rage boiled up within her. All the fury of the great God of 
Fire was at her fingertips, to be unleashed at any moment. Against any 
foe.

&quot;DIE!&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Mai shook her head frantically against the images, pounding her 
forehead against the concrete until it hurt. &quot;NO! This isn&#39;t real!&quot; The 
voices came faster and thicker, jumbled into each other, all trying to 
speak at once, yelling at her from inside her own brain. Vision flashed 
behind her eyes faster than she could follow. It was all so...familiar.

&quot;This is the purpose for which you were created.&quot;

&quot;Tokiha!&quot;

Something was grabbing at her shoulder, but it was already too late. Her 
consciousness couldn&#39;t take any more. Her fist unclenched and her knees 
stopped shaking as all the muscles in her body went limp. Her body 
keeled over to one side with a wet splash as she hit the concrete.

&quot;TOKIHA!&quot;

Someone...someone was screaming her name. She tried to open her eyes and 
saw only a storm of colours.

&quot;This is your purpose...&quot;

...to destroy.

To kill.

She lashed out as hard as she could with both arms at the figure 
hovering over her. Her body convulsed. Her eyes went wide. &quot;GET AWAY 
FROM ME!&quot;

Something lashed across her face with a sharp crack and knocked her 
senseless.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The clouds were parting. The tremendous mass of darkness hanging over 
the city was spinning even faster than before, and in the very centre, 
the clouds parted. Slowly, the parting grew, until it became a narrow 
hole all the way up to the top of the storm and out. Then it spread, 
widening out ever so slowly, showing more and more of the clear starlit 
sky through the gap in the immense cloud cover, like a tunnel to another 
world. Unseen by eyes on the ground, the upper part of the monolithic 
tower blossomed out like a gigantic flower to reveal a dazzling aurora 
of light and colours, twisting and winding in on itself in 
ever-increasingly more complex patterns, tightening down into a single 
bright point that was every colour at once.

Down below, Armitage was getting furious. More scratches littered her 
arms and legs, even one across her cheek, blood trickling over her skin 
in thin streams. The muscles all along her arms stood out in sharp 
relief, tensed and ready, and her thighs were bunched up thick as she 
squeezed her hands into fists. Her teeth ground together with an audible 
scraping noise.

As the clouds parted above her head, moonlight streamed down over her 
like some sort of heavenly spotlight, illuminating her features in sharp 
relief. She grinned a decidedly malicious grin, the moonlight lending 
her an almost inhumanly evil aura. Her eyes narrowed malevolently at her 
opponent.

She opened her mouth to say something awe-inspiring, but a bright golden 
light flashed off to her left far below, jarring her attention.

A golden beam of light raced up through the air and collided with that 
beastly Orphan in a bright flash. The beam faded, the light resolved 
into the figure of a tall and vaguely feminine person of some 
description, body mostly obscured by a heavy, billowing black cloak and 
an enormously broad-rimmed black hat. The figure held one arm aloft in 
front, thrusting upward. Haruka looked closer, and discovered that the 
figure&#39;s entire left hand from just behind the wrist was instead 
replaced by a long, flat blade that glowed with an eerie golden 
yellowish light. The blade had driven itself straight into the 
underbelly of the Orphan upon impact until the tip protruded from its 
upper edge, gleaming wetly. Thick orange blood oozed down the figure&#39;s 
forearm and dripped from a bony elbow.

The Orphan gave a last, agonised screech, and then evaporated into a 
thousand pieces. With it, vanished the howling cyclone winds and the 
directionally challenged rain, and even the clouds above were starting 
to dissolve. However, that mysterious figure stayed floating still where 
the creature had been slain, the blade glowing brighter yet.

&quot;Negating dimensional field...&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Haruka shifted back into an anticipatory stance. &quot;What the hell?&quot;

The glowing yellow light died without a sound. High above, where no one 
would really notice, the ball of writhing energy winked out of existence 
like a light being switched off.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yet again, the car rolled to a gentle stop. Only the driver seemed to 
notice; the lone passenger was still engrossed in staring off into the 
middle distance, a glazed look in her eyes. When there came a tapping on 
the blacked-out window separating the passenger area from the driver&#39;s 
cab, it took her quite a while to even notice.

&quot;Yes?&quot; She tapped one carefully manicured fingernail impatiently against 
the wooden panel armrest beside her, her weight resting on her elbow as 
she leaned against the thing lethargically.

&quot;There&#39;s a call for you, Fumiyoshi-sama. It&#39;s the committee line.&quot;

She snapped up the receiver set into the armrest and brought it at once 
to her ear, a dark expression clouding her face. &quot;Fumiyoshi,&quot; she 
declared in a decidedly acidic tone of voice. &quot;What do you want now?&quot;

As the other person talked, her expression shifted from dangerously grim 
to acute irritation, and her fingers found their way back down to start 
drumming against the armrest by her side. She tipped her head slightly, 
and all that thick lavender-coloured hair came rushing down to obscure 
her face like a curtain being drawn. She blew at it with frustration, 
but it refused to move.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; she replied at last, sitting up a little straighter. &quot;Where 
do you get off telling me how to run my own company? Don&#39;t you think I 
know what I&#39;m doing after ten years? I hope I don&#39;t have to remind you, 
I may look like a child to you, but looks aren&#39;t everything.&quot;

She turned quiet again as that imbecile on the other end started 
spouting more garbage, twisting her narrow mouth into an agitated scowl.

&quot;No, you listen to me, you little pencil-pushing bitch,&quot; she 
interrupted, loudly. &quot;You keep your own damned opinions to yourself. 
You&#39;re paid to advise that bastard Minagi, well you can advise him this. 
Tell him I know what I&#39;m damn well doing and if he thinks he can do a 
better job, he&#39;ll just have to come to Tokyo and see for himself! That 
idiot already screwed these girls over twice now. They&#39;re not his 
personal fucking toys, they&#39;re extremely valuable property and moreover, 
they&#39;re still more human than not. They deserve to be handled as such!&quot; 
She paused and took a very deep breath.

&quot;Oh, and one more thing. Tell him if I hear another single one of his 
stupid dance metaphors, I swear, I&#39;m going to get Kotetsu to screw him 
over so hard, HE&#39;LL be the one wearing the fucking dress for the rest of 
his life!&quot;

She slammed the phone down hard. Then she picked it up and slammed it 
again so hard the plastic cracked.

For a while, she just sat there being extremely pissed off, grating her 
teeth and digging her nails into the upholstery until it started 
ripping. Eventually, she calmed down far enough to close her eyes, take 
a nice deep, long breath and relax back into her seat again. Her heart 
was still pounding in her chest and her temper still felt frayed to the 
very last thread, so she took another deep breath, followed by a third. 
Somewhere along the way, she ended up with her knees together, hands in 
her lap, her head back and her eyes closed, humming softly to herself. 
Her tension swiftly disappeared once she really got into it, just the 
way it usually did.

&quot;Thank the Kami for mother&#39;s stupid yoga classes,&quot; she muttered to 
herself without moving her lips. Oh, now she was doing it again, talking 
inside her own head. Bad habit that.

&quot;Stupid Minagi. Self-absorbed little brat. If I were still myself, I bet 
then he&#39;d listen.&quot;

She blinked her eyes open at that and looked down. Then she frowned. Her 
hands drifted on up to her chest. &quot;Damn, I hate being young again. 
People won&#39;t listen to a flat-chested, whiny little girl.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps you would be more comfortable back in your own body, 
Fumiyoshi-sama? Auricom do still have your old DNA files, don&#39;t they? 
I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be happy to rebuild it for you.&quot;

The pink-haired girl smiled cheerfully at the darkened window, beyond 
which, hid that familiar face behind the wheel. &quot;Thank you, Juno-san, 
but... I&#39;m kind of attached to this one now. Besides, I want to see the 
look on her face when we meet again.&quot;

&quot;Whose face, miss?&quot;

She rolled her eyes derisively. &quot;Who else?&quot;

&quot;Ah...I see. You&#39;re awfully attached to her as well, it would seem.&quot;

The young girl blushed just a little, her lavender hair falling down 
either side of her face seemed to emphasise the colour in her cheeks. 
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; she murmured, mostly to herself. &quot;She has a habit of growing 
on people.&quot;

She lapsed back into silence as the car moved away again. For a long 
while, her eyes were shut and her breathing levelled out and she drifted 
somewhere just beyond full consciousness, in the calm and peaceful void 
inside her own mind. It was definitely therapeutic, but then mother had 
always had a knack for cooling people off. It was so serene, in fact, 
that she once again failed to register her name being called until about 
the fifth attempt.

&quot;Fumiyoshi-sama! Please, wake up, it&#39;s urgent.&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t asleep,&quot; huffed the young pink-haired girl, uncrossing her 
legs and jabbing a finger at one of the buttons on the armrest. There 
was a soft click from the speaker set in the ceiling. &quot;Who is it and 
what do you want?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Tatami,&quot; answered a non-descript and rather androgynous voice, 
highly toned and softly spoken. &quot;Miss Fumiyoshi, the committee would 
like to inform you that there has been a slight change of plans.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m well aware of the changes to the deployment schedule, thank you 
very much Tatami.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s a little more complicated than you might think, Miss. 
The committee decided that, while a Japanese military presence in Tokyo 
would not be too suspicious in the eyes of the public, the situation at 
hand is accelerating more rapidly than they had planned. A vote was cast 
and it has already been agreed that the remaining five units will not be 
ready for the trials on time and, as such, are due to be dismantled and 
decommissioned.&quot;

The young businesswoman-come-princess gasped and slapped a hand down on 
the armrest by her side. &quot;That...that is unacceptable! And just what do 
they plan to do with the five of them once all the augmentations...?&quot; 
She slumped back into her seat with a heavy sigh. &quot;No, don&#39;t tell me. 
I&#39;m sure I can guess.&quot;

&quot;Also, the committee have agreed to grant Mr. Reinsfield&#39;s company a 
covert military presence within the city in case the conditions escalate 
any further, since the Japanese Self-Defence Forces would be more than 
outmatched should another Orphan appear without any of the project units 
available to intercept it. I have-&quot;

She stabbed angrily at another button and the line cut out with a 
satisfying click. Her other hand was still balled into a fist, shaking 
wildly by her side, her nails clawing into her palm. &quot;Idiots,&quot; she spat 
under her breath. &quot;Leave everything to the very last second and then 
they expect our external contractors to cover up all the holes. And what 
of BAE themselves? Couldn&#39;t they have planned for this from the very 
beginning?&quot;

A most wicked thought skipped across the back of her mind, bringing a 
grimace to her face. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d love the chance to show that 
damned Armitage of theirs off to everyone in the G8 if they could. Smug 
foreign bastards.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll make a detour, shall I, Fumiyoshi-sama? To the nearest park...&quot;

Once again, her smile turned a little sweeter and her tensed facial 
muscles slackened. &quot;Thank you, Juno-san. I suppose it would help to calm 
down a little before my engagement.&quot; She took another very deep breath, 
closed her eyes and started humming softly to herself.
