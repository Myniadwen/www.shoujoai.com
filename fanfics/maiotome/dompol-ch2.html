----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yumemiya Arika yawned. 

Probably a foolish, rude and impolitic thing to do during a full session 
of the Garderobe Council, but yawn she did. 

And Mashiro, high queen, ruler and monarch of Windbloom, (and also the 
otome&#39;s master) wouldn&#39;t let her forget it. 

&quot;Did you have a pleasant nap?&quot; Mashiro asked sweetly as they both left 
Garderobe for the trip back to the castle. Luckily, Arika remembered to 
hold the door for her queen. 

&quot;Heh...that was my mistake,&quot; Arika said sheepishly. &quot;I didn&#39;t know those 
council meetings could drag on for so long.&quot; 

&quot;At least act like a Meister Otome in public,&quot; Mashiro growled, quickly 
dropping her &quot;regal monarch&quot; mask. Take Haruka Armitage for example. She 
just stood back and looked impressive the whole meeting.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t that because Kruger-Gakuenchou threatened to have her gagged if 
she made another outburst?&quot; Arika pointed out. &quot;Still, I wouldn&#39;t mind 
being an otome like her.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re missing one or two things before you can do that,&quot; Mashiro 
replied slyly.

&quot;I-I&#39;m still growing!&quot; Arika cried, self-consciously looking down at her 
rather small bosom.

&quot;But don&#39;t worry too much about yawning,&quot; Mashiro changed the subject. 
&quot;At least you cut off that pompous new emperor of Cardair.&quot; 

Arika noticed her master&#39;s scowl and wondered just what the emperor had 
done to earn such disfavor. Then she recalled (between naps) that the 
emperor attached a rider to the Technology Proliferation Act, which 
ear-marked longevity treatments for royalty. 

The queen was nearly fuming when she found out and had challenged her 
fellow monarch on the council floor. However, when Cardair made a snide 
remark about &quot;youthful sentimentality for the departed, overriding 
common sense,&quot; Mashiro had to be restrained.

But instead of screaming, Mashiro coldly stared the man down. &quot;The lost 
technology of Garderobe belongs to the people. As long as I rule I will 
keep my promise to them,&quot; she said. &quot;Anyone who forgets that is not a 
friend or ally of Windbloom.&quot; 

On that note, the rider was abolished by a unanimous vote of the 
council.

Arika guiltily recalled looking on Mashiro with unabashed awe. She might 
have continued staring had a hand not touched her shoulder. Arika looked 
up into the garnet eyes of the Beguiling Amethyst, Shizuru Viola.

&quot;Is something interesting?&quot; the Third Column asked. &quot;I rarely see you so 
absorbed in one thing.&quot;

&quot;Ah! No...that is,&quot; the younger otome stammered. &quot;It&#39;s just Mashiro-chan 
surprised me. She was just so amazing.&quot;

&quot;Absorbed was perhaps the wrong word,&quot; Shizuru mused with a warm smile. 
&quot;It&#39;s more like you were enthralled.&quot;

&quot;I was not! I was just... Arika&#39;s protest was cut short as she noticed 
the queen looking at her. Or rather, as the queen noticed that Arika had 
been staring at her for the past few moments.

Emerald and opal eyes met, then turned away as the president of Aires 
said something to the queen. What was that just now?

&quot;She&#39;s born with it isn&#39;t she?&quot; Arika asked Shizuru. &quot;Even if she&#39;s not 
of noble blood, the nobility&#39;s still there.&quot;

&quot;Everyone is born with a Heaven-sent talent,&quot; the older otome said as 
she placed her arms about Arika. &quot;Just as you were born to be an otome 
she was born to be a queen. But just the same it&#39;s a choice as to what 
one will do with that talent.&quot; 

&quot;Of course truly talented people have the most difficult time admitting 
they need someone else in their lives,&quot; she said into Arika&#39;s ear. 

Arika turned beet-red as she felt Shizuru&#39;s lips on her cheek.

&quot;Good luck,&quot; the Third Column said while leaving Arika to blush and 
ponder those words.

&quot;Take the next right,&quot; Mashiro instructed the driver. 

&quot;Where are we going? Arika queried. Consumed by her recollection, she 
didn&#39;t recognize this part of town.

The queen smiled back at her with a twinkle in her emerald eyes. &quot;To 
Mimi&#39;s house.&quot; 

----------

Close to Wind City&#39;s center, next to the refurbished river, stood a 
complex of dormitories, schools and parks. Contracted by Queen Mashiro 
Blan de Windbloom, the modestly named &quot;Mimi&#39;s House&quot; was many things at 
once. It consisted of free schools for children as well as an extension 
of Windbloom Royal University for adults. 

The rapidly modernizing country needed skilled workers to build and 
repair the machinery of progress. At Mimi&#39;s House, the city&#39;s poorest 
citizens could learn new trades while living in comfortable, low-cost 
housing.

Beside the river rested a large park with vast playing fields, plentiful 
trees and gentle hills. Beneath a tremendous cypress sat the queen 
Mashiro as she read a story to the gathered youth. 

The youngster, children of the families who trained there, were dozing 
in the balmy afternoon. Even though they loved the old story of the 
Princess who dared to take up a weapon to fight for the one she loved.

As she read the familiar words, Mashiro&#39;s mind wandered; down through 
days weeks and months she descended. To a time where her life was life 
was less than secure, her very survival in question.

------------------ 
THE BLACK VALLEY 
------------------

Such an odd name for such a tranquil place. The sheer rock walls of the 
valley shrouded the gentle grasses and aromatic woods of this place of 
legend. It was nothing at all like the horror stories a young Princess 
Mashiro Blan de Windbloom used to thrill to at night. 

Indeed she too was a stark contrast to what a monarch should be. Her 
clothes clean but ragged, aches and pains from manual labors reminded 
her body that she needed rest. But she couldn&#39;t rest quite yet.

Fetching water was her chore tonight, she recalled as the empty bucket 
bumped her leg. The young queen of Windbloom continued down the flag 
stoned path to the well. She&#39;d need to clean and dress Arika&#39;s wounds 
well. Mashiro was a bit skeptical when her otome started training with 
the feral cat god Mikoto. More often than not, Arika would come back 
from sessions looking like shed lost a war rather than a sparring match.

However, seeing the bubbly girl trying so hard to better herself gave 
Mashiro a bit of confidence. Arika wouldn&#39;t give up when so much was 
dependent on her, so Mashiro would always be there to put her back 
together. 

Having drawn her water, the queen made her way back towards the rustic 
house where her charge awaited. However, she paused at an odd noise. 
After a short search Mashiro found her hostess, Mai Tokiha and her 
companion (master?) the cat god Mikoto sitting on a precipice. 

&quot;Mikoto wait!&quot; the prodigal otome laughed as she attempted to wipe the 
other girl&#39;s face with a cloth. &quot;Let me clean that wound first.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s just a scratch,&quot; Mikoto dismissed as she went in to steal another 
kiss.

For the moment, Mai was fending off her efforts, if only half- 
heartedly. &quot;Arika must be getting stronger if she could actually land a 
hit,&quot; she surmised.

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Mikoto nodded, deciding to let Mai tend to her for the moment. 
&quot;She&#39;s still got a way to go but I think she can do it. Of course if 
she&#39;s going to win she&#39;ll need the last piece.&quot;

The diminutive deity glance straight at the tree Mashiro had ducked 
behind. &quot;But that&#39;s your job to take care of,&quot; she said as she gave her 
otome a peck on the cheek and bounded off into the night.

&quot;You can come out now,&quot; the strawberry-blonde otome called. 

Chagrined and blushing, Mashiro emerged from her hiding place and joined 
Mai on the precipice. 

The two sat in silence and gazed at the broken landscape of the valley, 
illuminated by the silvery full moon. Despite the tranquil surroundings 
Mashiro&#39;s mind swirled with questions (and not just about what she&#39;d 
walked in on). 

&quot;So...are you two...?&quot; Mashiro ventured.

&quot;I could ask the same about you and Arika-chan,&quot; Mai teased. 

&quot;We are SO not like that!&quot; Mashiro bristled. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Mai laughed gently. &quot;You&#39;re still both too young to think 
about that. But being royalty is a lot like being in a relationship.&quot;

The queen shot Mai a bemused look.

&quot;If you don&#39;t think of your partner&#39;s happiness things could go bad,&quot; 
Mai continued. &quot;The same as when you don&#39;t think of your subjects&#39; 
happiness.&quot;

&quot;I get that,&quot; Mashiro said quietly, a shadow passing before her emerald 
eyes. &quot;Being a queen means you&#39;re responsible for people&#39;s lives. Even 
though they serve you, they also depend on you to do what&#39;s right.&quot;

&quot;It seems Arika&#39;s not the only one who&#39;s improving her lessons,&quot; Mai 
smiled at her. &quot;Mashiro, how do you feel about Arika?&quot;

This caught the young monarch completely off-guard. She nervously 
fidgeted as a slight breeze played with her silver hair.

&quot;I...don&#39;t know,&quot; she answered honestly. &quot;But I&#146;m glad she&#39;s with me.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a good answer,&quot; Mai replied. &quot;I sometimes feel the same way 
about Mikoto. Even if she drives me crazy sometimes, it feels like 
something wants us to be together. I guess you could call that fate.&quot;

A shiver ran down Mashiro&#39;s spine upon hearing the word &quot;fate.&quot; How many 
times, since e their first meeting had she and Arika been thrown 
together? How many times had they saved each other from despair? What 
was the strange hold that the clumsy, rude girl had on her. Could she 
fight it? SHOULD she fight it?

&quot;Mashiro,&quot; Mai interrupted her rumination. &quot;You&#39;ll have to support her.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Mashiro said, wondering what the older woman was getting at. 

&quot;You know, Mikoto&#39;s a bit psychic,&quot; Mai said, her voice very solemn. 
&quot;she can&#39;t do it every day, only when the emotion&#39;s very strong.&quot;

Mashiro was startled when Mai suddenly took her hand. 

&quot;You&#39;re going to have to ask Arika to do something terrible for a good 
cause. You have to be strong because she won&#39;t be.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Mashiro broke in. &quot;What&#39;s going to happen to her?&quot;

Mai only shook her head. &quot;Mikoto wouldn&#39;t tell me. She said it was just 
too sad.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I can do that. I don&#39;t know if I can hurt Arika.&quot; 

Mai pulled the young queen into a hug. &quot;It&#39;s just one of the hard 
choices you have to make when you&#39;re the queen,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Even 
more if that choice affects the one you care about.&quot;

------------------- 
Present day 
-------------------

A loud snore jarred Mashiro from her reverie. Several of the children 
not already asleep were dozing. Along with young Meister Otome sleeping 
with her head perched on her master&#39;s lap. Since she&#39;d rarely had the 
opportunity, Mashiro took her time studying Arika&#39;s sleeping face. 

The normally energetic girl&#39;s face was serene in slumber. A slight sheen 
of sweat covered he brow, and her braids had almost unraveled; proof of 
her rough and tumble play with the children. 

The queen reached down to smooth away a few errant hairs. 

&quot;Mashiro-chan.&quot; 

The queen started at hearing her name issue from those lips. Just as it 
had the previous night, when Mashiro was in her quarters. She didn&#39;t 
know why her steps had led her to the otome&#39;s room, but being there, 
looking over her sleeping face as she did now, just felt so right.

Mashiro moved closer...closer to that sweet, sleeping face.

-------------

Yumemiya Arika was dreaming again. The same dark, twisting corridors, 
echoing footfalls and fear. Or was that excitement? Her body moved of 
its own accord. She caught the fleeing figure and they both tumbled to 
the floor. She found herself gazing up into those mirthful, hungry, 
emerald eyes. And then...

She was temporarily blinded by sunlight. Yet as she recovered her 
senses, Arika found those eyes staring down at her again. Only now they 
were so much closer and so very real as Mashiro hovered above her. Their 
lips were only a breath apart. 

&quot;Arika,&quot; she whispered, her breath tickling the otome&#39;s skin. 

The meister otome, Arika could only gaze back dumbly. 

&quot;Arika, Mashiro repeated softly. &quot;You are so...heavy!&quot;</pre>
