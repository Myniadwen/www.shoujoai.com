<h1>What Happens at Garderobe, Stays at Garderobe (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maiotome/index.html">Mai Otome</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This is set before Mai Otome 0, based on character interactions and 
random guesses by me, so don&#39;t consider it canon.

----------

Rena Sayers smiled slightly as the brown haired woman hurried down the 
hall at Garderobe, looking for a certain face among the fellow students. 
Her eyes brightened as she saw a familiar blonde head, forcing her way 
to her side.

&quot;Rena!&quot; Elliot Chandler smiled, the slightly shorter blonde throwing her 
arms around her, &quot;We did it! We graduated!&quot;

&quot;That we did, Meister Otome,&quot; Rena smiled warmly as she held her friend 
close.

It had been a long, hard road to graduation for both of them. Garderobe 
always recruited more Coral students than needed, because they knew that 
a good chunk would be unable to stand the rigors of Otome training or 
otherwise prove unsuitable. Many of their friends had faltered on the 
road to graduation, and both of them felt a twinge of regret at losing 
them.

Elliot smiled impishly, &quot;Didn&#39;t you promise me something if we both made 
it...?&quot;

&quot;Elliot!&quot; Rena gasped as the other girl went for a kiss, &quot;Not here! 
Everyone can see!&quot;

Rena fended the other girl off while seeing amused glances from the 
other students walking by them. While at Garderobe there was a certain 
degree of experimentation that went on, especially with the girls unable 
to engage in sex with men... a cold hard fact that went along with being 
a Otome.

&quot;Aww, Rena!&quot; Elliot pouted cutely, giving her a look that had melted 
many a female heart before now .

&quot;You never give up,&quot; Rena said as she shook her head firmly, her blue 
graduation robe swirling around her.

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t be happy if I did,&quot; Elliot smiled back, looking handsome 
in her simple black and white garb.

&quot;You could be right,&quot; Rena conceded as they walked off together. She 
looked over at her, &quot;Congradulations on becoming one of the five 
columns, too.&quot;

Elliot looked a bit uncomfortable as she quietly said, &quot;You could be one 
of the five too, you know.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Rena waved that off as she said, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m suited to 
that. I&#39;d rather be just a ordinary Otome...&quot;

Elliot looked at Rena fondly as she thought, &#39;You&#39;ll never be just a 
ordinary Otome.&#39;

Rena Sayers was something of a prodigy, even for a Otome. She had 
mastered her lessons quickly and well, while her body had adapted 
unusually well to the nanomachine injection. Unlike most trainees she 
could even tap her powers without a robe, and with one she was nearly 
deadly. The biggest problem the headmaster was facing was Rena&#39;s 
tendency to actually overload GEMs... burning them out with her power.

Deciding not to push Elliot said aloud, &quot;I&#39;ll miss seeing you at 
Garderobe, Rena.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;ll miss you,&quot; Rena conceded as they walked into the dorms 
together. She looked at Elliot, &quot;Could you come up to my rooms with me?&quot;

Elliot smile widened as she took Rena&#39;s arm to hurry her along, &quot;Of 
course.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

With a moaning cry Rena collapsed on the bed, her sweat soaked body 
going limp against the sheets. &quot;Elliot,&quot; she managed, &quot;please, no more.&quot;

With a very self satisfied smile Elliot gracefully slid up from where 
she had been resting between Rena&#39;s legs and lay at her side, reaching 
out to push a sweaty strand of hair from Rena&#39;s face. &quot;You&#39;re beautiful 
like this,&quot; she said quietly.

Rena laughed softly as she met Elliot&#39;s eyes tenderly and asked, &quot;What, 
you mean in the grip of passion?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re lovely when you let yourself go,&quot; Elliot said. She grinned 
suddenly, &quot;Thank you for finally letting me see you like this.&quot;

&quot;After you&#39;ve been chasing me for weeks?&quot; Rena laughed as she looked at 
Elliot happily, &quot;I&#39;m glad you never gave up.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t be mucjh of a otome if I gave up,&quot; Elliot snuggled close to 
her as she purred, &quot;and trust me, it was worth it.&quot;

The two of them lay there for awhile comfortably in a tangle of limbs 
and sheets as their bodies cooled down a bit then Rena began, &quot;Elliot?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Elliot answered.

Rena looked at her with a compassionate gaze, &quot;Does it bother you that 
many of the girls you&#39;ve loved here will forget about you?&quot;

Elliot chuckled softly as she teasingly asked, &quot;How could they forget 
days like this?&quot;

&quot;You know what I mean,&quot; Rena said, &quot;they&#39;ll go out into the world, serve 
their masters, fall in love and retire...&quot;

Elliot looked thoughtful a moment, &quot;Maybe so, but they&#39;ll also remember 
what we had... and I hope they&#39;ll think of me fondly sometime.&quot; A saucy 
grin teased her lips, &quot;And maybe some pretty girl will decide to settle 
down with me.&quot;

Rena squeezed her shoulder as she said in a only partially joking way, 
&quot;Just as long as I get visiting rights.&quot;

Elliot squealed happily as she rolled over onto Rena,&quot;You like me! You 
really like me!&quot;

&quot;Would you get off me!&quot; Rina flailed her arms.

&quot;Nooo...&quot; Elliot laughed, &quot;I&#39;ve got to stock up until we meet again.&quot;

&quot;Not the nipples, don&#39;t tug on...&quot; Rina gasped, &quot;oooh!&quot;

Outside, a redheaded Otome listened with wide eyes. Raquel Mayol 
lingered by the door as she heard their cries, eventually whipping out a 
notbook and righting things down. &#39;This&#39;ll come in handy when I see 
Shion,&#39; she thought.

&quot;Ahem,&quot; a voice was cleared just behind her.

&quot;Eeek!&quot; Raquel jumped in surprise then spun around. &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; she 
squeaked.

Maria Graceburt gave her a look that could be considered a mix of amused 
and annoyed as the severely dressed blonde said, &quot;Should you really be 
lingering here?&quot;

&quot;No, ma&#39;am,&quot; Raquel quickly stuffed her notes into her pocket, &quot;excuse 
me.&quot;

Maria shook her head, frowning as Elliot and Rena started up again. Her 
first instinct was to hammer on the door and order them to quiet down, 
but she hesitated. Both girls were leaving soon, and she was reluctant 
to interrupt their farewell...

&quot;Oooh!&quot; Rena gasped, heard all the way out in the hall.

&#39;And I&#39;m not exactly without fault myself,&#39; Maria admitted, thinking 
rather guiltily of her feelings for the headmistress Una Shamrock. &#39;No,&#39; 
she resolved, &#39;I&#39;ll leave them alone until someone actually complains.&#39;

End...?

Notes: Sort for the short length, but I didn&#39;t want to pad this out too 
much. Just a short, slightly goofy look at the Otome, including some 
random guesses by me. Heh
