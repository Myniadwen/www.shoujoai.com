<h1>Mai Kisaki (part 2 of 22)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maiotome/index.html">Mai Otome</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/asinistre.html">Ange Sinistre</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maiotome/kisaki-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Castle Windbloom

They had originally put the two groups of unusual guests in cells next 
to each other, but that led to nothing but insults and threats being 
spat back and forth between them. It became so bad that the guards 
feared a brawl would erupt if they were taken out of their cells for 
whatever purpose. The two groups of girls were separated and taken out 
at vastly different times to prevent chaos within the prison section of 
the castle grounds. The first group had GEMs on their ears, which were 
taken off to prevent materialization. The other, more peculiar devices 
in use by the second were taken away, as were their combat suits.

They naturally became subject to an intense study that was led by 
Garderobe&#39;s Director of Medicine and GEM Technology, Yoko Helene. She 
and several of Windbloom&#39;s finest scientists were tasked with various 
objectives to determine who the prisoners were and where they were from. 
Now she had to add why they wanted to kill each other to the list, as 
well as the nature of that other kind of device. Language barriers 
proved to be a bit of a problem at first. When they brought in 
translators from Zipang after the arrival of Takumi and his staff it 
became easier, just as Yoko had hypothesized. The languages were 
similar.

Only the ones who had admitted to be Otome were talking. The other group 
refused to answer questions. Yoko adjusted her clipboard as she wrote 
down something on one of her documents. &quot;So, to make sure I have this 
right, your name is &#39;Hamasaki Izumi&#39; and her name is &#39;Uematsu Naomi.&#39; 
You are both Otome, of the Upsilon Type variant, as you called it. Is 
this correct?&quot;

The translator from Zipang sent the message in that nation&#39;s ancient 
tongue, and returned with. &quot;That is correct, ma&#39;am.&quot;

Yoko continued on, looking straight at this Izumi woman (she would have 
to take care to remember the surname reversal) as she stated her follow 
up inquiry. &quot;We only have one variant of Otome here. Would you care to 
explain the features of whatever variants you have where you&#39;re from?&quot;

The message was translated, and, in quick phrases, the answers was 
translated back to her via the interpreter. Izumi spoke frantically, 
like she was trying her best to get on Yoko&#39;s good side so that she 
might be freed. &quot;She says... &#39;There are three variants of the Otome. The 
first one created was the X-Type, or Chi variant. It had no flight 
function and could only be used in short bursts. It was limited to only 
a few specific GEMs. The revision to that was the Y-Type, or Upsilon 
variant. Flight was introduced, and lots of people could use a generic 
mass produced GEM.&#39;&quot;

&quot;Rather like our Corals and Pearls,&quot; Yoko assumed.

The translator shrugged and continued speaking for the young woman in 
the cell. &quot;The last was the Z-Type, or Zeta variant. Z-Types did not 
have to rely on an &#39;Emulator,&#39; I think she said, and could be powered 
simply through a bond between keys and Otome. Keys? I don&#39;t know. That 
sounded weird. Said something about how X-Type GEMs got upgraded to 
Z-Type GEMs over the years, and we probably have some.&quot;

What would keys have to do with a contract between and Otome and their 
client? Never the less, she scratched all the information down for 
future reference. &quot;The first real Otome here was using the Pure White 
Diamond.&quot;

Izumi&#39;s eyes widened after hearing that from the translator. &quot;That was 
the first Zeta variant GEM ever used, she says quite happily. That would 
mean Garderobe also has the first five GEMs ever made, which were 
scheduled to be upgraded to Z-Types during transit. The Firestring Ruby, 
the Ice Silver Crystal, the Dazzling Lapis, the Lovely Onyx, and the 
Continental Topaz.&quot;

&quot;How old are they? Carbon dating indicates they&#39;re a little younger than 
the Diamond, but if they were significantly altered, I suppose that 
would make sense,&quot; Yoko asked.

Izumi struggled with her memory for a moment. Eventually, she said, 
&quot;They were made around 2020, I think. The first people to use them were 
defeated by the HiME, but after that, the Otome became a prominent force 
on Earth.&quot;

&quot;HiME?&quot; Yoko repeated, falling into thought. Highly Advanced 
Materializing Equipment? That was certainly a phrase known in the Otome 
system that Garderobe used. She thought &#39;Z-Type HiME&#39; only referred to a 
program that governed the weapon materialization system, not an actual 
type of warrior. &quot;What is, or who are, HiME?&quot;

The translator simply said, &quot;They are the enemy.&quot;

- - -

Natsuki, as the leader of Garderobe, was to oversee all discussion by 
the rulers of the twelve kingdoms and the other regions who had sent in 
diplomats. The job involved a lot of sitting and listening, and little 
else. Every once and a while she would have to step in and play mother 
to the bickering kings and queens, but that had not happened for some 
time. So, her job was to sit, listen, and occasionally draw epic stick 
figure battles all over the backside of her documents when no one was 
looking &#150; while still paying attention, of course.

The rulers all filed into the room and took their usual seats, a new one 
reserved for Midori of Aswad, and began their meetings in the 
traditional fashion. When it came time to get to the subject at hand, 
those supposed citizens of Earth, it was easy to see that the group was 
split down the middle on the &#39;hoax&#39; versus &#39;legitimate&#39; issue.

&quot;Yoko, would you please step forward and give your report?&quot; Natsuki 
ordered after some preliminary discussion. &quot;Perhaps there is irrefutable 
evidence in their favor.&quot;

The doctor approached the podium with a stack of papers, and gave 
everyone a humble nod before she began to speak. &quot;Thank you, 
Headmistress Kruger. I have not had long to analyze the various people 
taken in from their respective crashes, but a large amount of 
information has been accumulated. I will not say whether I truly believe 
they are from Earth or not. I will leave that to you. From what evidence 
I have uncovered, their knowledge of the Otome system extends far beyond 
what most students in Garderobe and world officials are aware of. They 
know things that are classified to the top level of the academy&#39;s 
staff.&quot;

&quot;The subjects Izumi Hamasaki and Naomi Uematsu have explained that they 
are Otome from Earth &#150; specifically from the city of Kyoto, a city 
within the region of Nihon. Their language is different from our 
traditional one, having words and sentence structures more commonly 
found in the older tongue of Zipang. They can communicate slightly with 
me directly, displaying that our languages are perhaps based on two 
older languages of Earth,&quot; she continued. &quot;And, much like in the eldest 
records of Zipang dating from just before the War of the Twelve Kings, 
their surnames are listed before their given name.&quot;

The leaders were all listening intently, the staff from Zipang paying 
extra special attention at that point. Yoko continued on, never really 
feeling comfortable with public speaking, but managing. &quot;They claim 
three different variants of Otome exist or have existed. The first was 
the X-Type, which they call the Chi variant. It was created circa 2020 
AD, but was very basic in its abilities. The Y-Type, or the Upsilon 
variant, was apparently developed around 2400 AD after a pause in the 
program, and by then the Otome had become the guardians of the Earth 
nations, like we have here. The Z-Type, or Zeta variant, is what our 
Otome are, and it was developed on board the colony ship that took the 
first people here. Transmissions sent back to Earth while they were in 
transit allowed those on Earth to make their own Z-Type GEMs.&quot;

Natsuki stopped drawing, then, quite intrigued by that kind of 
information. Some elaborate hoax, indeed. The headmistress offered a 
question. &quot;Why have they come here, if they are indeed from Earth?&quot;

&quot;They keep saying that they are involved with some kind of war with a 
rival group known as the HiME that has lasted for generations. It seems 
to be some kind of war of attrition, neither side willing to compromise. 
It seems to almost be a cultural thing, to kill a member of the rival 
&#39;tribe,&#39; so to speak. They are here... to ask for the aid of our Otome,&quot; 
Yoko said. &quot;The other group that Meister Armitage captured are 
apparently HiME, but they refuse to speak a word to me.&quot;

Mashiro held up her hand. &quot;They want to take this world&#39;s Otome back to 
Earth to help in a war? Did I just hear that right?&quot;

Yoko nodded. &quot;I&#39;m afraid so. They want help fighting against the HiME, 
and young Miss Izumi wishes to speak to the lot of us to plead her 
case.&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t risk that, regardless of what she has to say,&quot; the king of 
Annam stated. &quot;What if it is a hoax and some kind of trap? Or, even if 
it is true, we have been separate from Earth for this long, and should 
not feel compelled to enter their conflicts.&quot;

Natsuki crossed her arms and sighed. &quot;There is a written code in 
Garderobe dating back to the foundation of the academy that states that 
against a common enemy, the Otome are to come to each other&#39;s aid at all 
times. If they are indeed Otome, then that may still apply. If they have 
a similar code, it could be seen as a very negative political statement 
to deny them our assistance. Assuming they are indeed from Earth.&quot;

&quot;Could the Otome even materialize on a different planet without the 
Shinso or Surrogate system?&quot; Mashiro asked.

&quot;May I suggest that we le--&quot; Yoko began to say, but found herself 
interrupted by a most... unexpected visitor to their discussion.

Mikoto, the guardian of the Black Valley, kicked open the doors with a 
very excited face. She ran into the center of the room, Mai Tokiha 
following behind and shouting various requests for her to stop. Mikoto 
did not until she had gotten all their attention, almost bouncing up and 
down. &quot;Did they come back? Where are they? I wanna see!&quot;

Natsuki and all the other members of the assemble paused in utter 
surprise and confusion. What? The headmistress managed to say, &quot;Who are 
you referring to, Miss Minagi?&quot;

Mikoto was swaying back and forth in impatience. &quot;The ones who just came 
down. My teachers always said that they would always come back to check 
on us. I&#39;ve been waiting very patiently, like I was told to. Mai, am I 
good?&quot;

Mai shook her head and then managed a nervous laugh, very self-conscious 
in the room full of the world&#39;s leaders. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, everyone, she just 
took off yesterday like a crazy person. I could barely follow her. 
Mikoto just said she had to be here. I&#39;m sorry, again. I&#39;ll get her out 
of here. Come on, Mikoto, I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll make you ramen.&quot;

&quot;But...!&quot;

&quot;Mikoto, I mean it! Let&#39;s go!&quot; Mai tugged on her arm, but Mikoto refused 
to budge an inch.

Several of the rulers just wrinkled up their faces in disappointment and 
embarrassment. Others, however, merely looked intrigued. It was Natsuki 
who spoke up. She had always wondered just how old this cat goddess was. 
&quot;Mikoto, just how exactly old are you? Something had been guarding the 
Harmonium since the days of the great war, but you couldn&#39;t possibly...&quot;

&quot;Mikoto is 319 years, 3 months, and 15 days old.&quot;

Or she could be. Natsuki almost glared, both because the girl had proven 
her wrong and because it was simply ludicrous. &quot;How is that possible?&quot;

&quot;Um, well, the people who took us here in the first place poked me with 
a needle when I turned fourteen years and said that I would live for a 
long, long time,&quot; Mikoto informed with a nod. She held out her arms wide 
for reference. &quot;They told me to watch the big piano and make sure nobody 
touched it! Mikoto only grows one year&#39;s worth in about two hundred 
years.&quot;

&quot;Who are those people who took you here?&quot; Mashiro questioned.

They were my instructors from the Dammerung Otome Academy!&quot; Mikoto said. 
&quot;My friends and I were part HiME and part Otome. We were special, they 
said. Fumi got to have the pretty rock. Mikoto didn&#39;t get one. It was 
not finished. Can I talk to them now?&quot;

&quot;You knew Fumi?&quot; Haruka asked from her position next to President 
Yukino. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you say anything about that until now?&quot;

&quot;You never asked.&quot;

Haruka paused. &quot;...Well, of all the stupid-!&quot;

&quot;Haruka, don&#39;t!&quot; Yukino warned, putting her hand on Haruka&#39;s arm to calm 
her down. &quot;All right, I know this is a lot to take in for everyone, but 
I suppose if Mikoto is truly that old she could spot someone just 
pretending to be from Earth. Why don&#39;t we bring in the one who wanted to 
speak and let her voice her opinions?&quot;

One by one, the leaders relented and agreed. What did they have to lose? 
Yoko stepped down from the podium and signaled for the guards to bring 
in Izumi, who had been waiting patiently and silently in another room. 
She gulped and sprang up, her hands still bound. Never had she expected 
to be jailed. She was just a messenger. She knew her task was to get 
aid, but she found herself incredibly nervous now that she was facing a 
grand council of the world&#39;s rulers. She had instructions to speak with 
whoever was the leader of the Otome, not try her hand at diplomacy.

&quot;You have the floor,&quot; Takumi said in his country&#39;s native language, 
trying his best to act as a helping hand. He offered her a gentle smile 
as proof of his character.

&quot;T-Thank you,&quot; she said. She would speak in English, to suit the rest of 
them, even if it might end up being a bit rough around the edges. &quot;My 
name is Hamasaki Izumi, and I speak to you on behalf of the Kyoto Guard 
branch of the Otome. I was told to go to the leader of the Otome and ask 
for help, but now I ask all of you. My people have been at war since I 
was a baby, and well before that. We always hoped that the Otome who 
left would go back to Earth to save us. I ask that you help. Please.&quot;

&quot;You expect us to send our most valued warriors to the home world just 
to help in a war that isn&#39;t even ours?&quot; The king of Annam said, still 
holding fast in his mindset that they should have nothing to do with it. 
Several rulers backed him.

&quot;The others in the prison?&quot; Izumi continued, waving her hand to the door 
absently. &quot;The HiME? They are fanatics who want to kill every Otome they 
find. Now that they know that Otome are on here, they will hunt you down 
too. If you don&#39;t help and attack first, they will get you. We can go to 
Earth using the ship I came from, and we&#39;ll seal off the gateway we used 
before they can enter it. Then all we have to do is defeat them before 
they can find a way here. Travel through gate is instant. Fast.&quot;

&quot;Threatening us will not--&quot; the same king began, but was cut off.

&quot;Please! If you do not, your Otome will be breaking a code of honor!&quot; 
Izumi cried, utterly frustrated already. &quot;You don&#39;t have to give your 
most precious Otome. You can give volunteers. Anything, anything at all. 
Please. You don&#39;t know how horrible it is. Mothers, sisters, fathers &#150; 
all are killed just so the HiME can get to us!&quot;

Natsuki sighed. She was afraid of that. Garderobe&#39;s rigid codes, laid 
down by Fumi herself, almost forced her to dispatch forces to help. She 
drummed her fingers against the table, pondering what to do. If it were 
a team of volunteers, that would be all right, wouldn&#39;t it? As Natsuki 
continued to ponder, Mashiro spoke up.

&quot;Do you have any non-Otome political leaders on Earth?&quot; The young queen 
asked.

Izumi nodded frantically. &quot;Yes. That is why we are called Guard. Groups 
defend a region from the HiME and all other enemies. Guards can be very 
big. Kyoto Guard had several hundred warriors. The rulers of Nihon would 
certainly love to meet and ally with you. Trade, too. Lots of trade. 
Earth still has a lot of ore left, ah, and... we still have an Emulator 
to power your Columns! They can use the one we do!&quot;

She felt that she was losing an already uphill battle. She was getting 
so flustered that her English skills were failing her.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Mashiro began to suggest, &quot;we should send some representatives 
to see their rulers, and bring a group of volunteer Otome with us for 
protection. After we establish a proper union and learn about what&#39;s 
really going on, we can make a more informed decision.&quot;

The king of Annam and several other did a double take. Mashiro was, for 
once, sounding wise beyond her years, but what she was saying was out of 
the question. &quot;Have you gone insane, young queen? If you send that kind 
of group in, we&#39;ll practically be signing the lives of our Otome and our 
diplomats away if there&#39;s a real war going on!&quot;

&quot;Earth is still home,&quot; Mashiro said, &quot;and if we can stop the war and the 
carnage, all the better for everyone there. If Earth still exists, then 
there&#39;s hope all the other colonies are still full of people. We could 
go to Earth and then link up with all the other colonies to rebuild the 
lost stellar territories. We can regain everything that our ancestors 
lost. Right?&quot;

Midori, who had remained silent thus far, finally spoke up in her calm 
and almost emotionless voice. It was the perfect chance to recover all 
the old technology necessary to save her own people. If she could get 
her hands on it first, then there was a chance everything could be 
righted. There were still many who needed aid. &quot;I would be willing to go 
with you to Earth.&quot;

That stunned the other rulers even more. Perfect, now there was no way 
out of it. If Aswad leapt ahead in technological terms, then they could 
become a legitimate threat! Then, natural greed set in with every 
country wanting to stay on top of the arm&#39;s race even despite all their 
treaties. Most agreed to send ambassadors. A few rare individuals were 
willing to go themselves in hopes of making a more solid bond.

Midori al-Aswad, Mashiro blan de Windbloom, Yukino Chrysant, Arika 
Yumemiya and Haruka Armitage were the first volunteers. Akira Okuzaki 
would also be dispatched by Zipang as its representative. Izumi breathed 
a sigh of relief. Two Otome. It was not much, but it was a start. That 
just left the rest of the Otome to stand up and volunteer. Natsuki 
Kruger stood up after a moment, and excused herself. &quot;I will have my 
answer to you by tomorrow. If I return with volunteers, you will have 
temporary support. Do not treat this like a permanent alliance.&quot;

Izumi nodded. Mikoto, finally happy to see someone, ran up and shook 
Izumi&#39;s hand. &quot;They did come back. It&#39;s really them. The symbol on her 
hair clip is Dammerung&#39;s symbol. Mikoto wants to go home!&quot;

There was another. Mai waved her arms. &quot;What? You can&#39;t go!&quot;

&quot;Mai goes too. Mai cooks the food.&quot; There was another, whether the 
redhead wanted it or not. Mai shouted something in protest, but knew 
that it would probably do no good. Either way, she was obligated to go. 
She had a duty to protect Mikoto, who had become both her friend and 
master over the years. Mai sighed in defeat. Crap.

- - -

&quot;Well, what do you think?&quot; Natsuki asked her companion.

Shizuru merely shrugged. &quot;It is a very risky move in either direction. 
The temporary volunteer force may be your only path to take. No support 
and you will break our own laws. Too much support and you may threaten 
Garderobe and lose unnecessary life.&quot;

The headmistress groaned in frustration and chugged the glass of tea she 
had been given. &quot;I can&#39;t send in Corals or Pearls. They&#39;re too young and 
inexperienced. Our best bet would be the Columns and Otome who have yet 
to find a master despite having graduated. Assuming their &#39;Emulator&#39; can 
be calibrated to deal with us.&quot;

&quot;I will go, if you like.&quot; She said it very casually, like she was 
willing to go run to the store for a gallon of milk. A simple errand. 
Natsuki was still unnerved that Shizuru was willing to die at her 
command, and was not willing to let the woman go on such a task alone.

&quot;Those contracted to the diplomats are givens &#150; Arika and Haruka. I will 
make a general announcement for extra volunteers and whoever shows up, 
we will take,&quot; Natsuki said simply, already going for the GEM 
communication line. She was stopped by Shizuru, who gave her a mildly 
surprised glance. Actually, for Shizuru, that was the equivalent of a 
jaw drop.

&quot;We will take?&quot; Shizuru inquired. &quot;You intend to go?&quot;

&quot;It is only proper for the leader of the Otome to join the other 
representatives to meet with their rulers and their warriors. Do you 
disagree?&quot; Natsuki asked.

Shizuru tilted her head to the side. &quot;Well, no, I just was not expecting 
it. We will take them with us, will we? You make it sound like we&#39;re 
bringing the kids to the amusement park or the zoo. Who will watch 
Garderobe while we&#39;re away?&quot;

Natsuki glared at the comment referring to being parents of the other 
Otome, and simply said, &quot;Maria can handle administrative duties. Sara 
and Maya will act in our places until we return. They are fully capable 
of watching over the students and coordinating classes and activities.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough, I suppose,&quot; Shizuru said. She smiled. &quot;Ara, it&#39;s been some 
time since we had a genuine adventure together. This is rather exciting, 
isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Natsuki rolled her eyes and simply opened a communication line with 
every Otome who was wearing a GEM within a fifty mile radius. &quot;This is 
Headmistress Natsuki Kruger. The objects that fell from the sky were 
ships from Earth, and the occupants were fellow Otome requesting 
assistance on the home world, where a war is underway. Any Meister-level 
Otome interested in becoming a volunteer to defend the nation&#39;s 
representatives must report to my office within twenty-four hours. Over 
and out.&quot;

&quot;So businesslike.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Natsuki replied, not realizing that it was not exactly a 
compliment. She kicked back in her chair with a long sigh. While she had 
honestly been a bit bored with nothing but endless peace, this kind of 
adventure was a bit much! A quick battle out in the desert would have 
been good. Jetting off to a different planet where a catastrophic war 
was taking place? Yes, that was slightly overkill on the excitement.

She shifted in her chair and scratched at the lower left side of her 
back. It had been itching like hell all day. Burning, even. She hoped 
she hadn&#39;t been scratched by something poisonous during her various 
outings in Grauwald (or that Shizuru had somehow given her something 
vile &#150; not that she should have been contracting any of those kind of 
things from any random or not so random people). Maybe it was just those 
mosquitoes. God damned mosquitoes.

- - -

Volunteers were few and far between. Sara and Maya had agreed to take up 
the place of temporary Headmistress and Archmeister, respectively. Both 
were wanderers by nature, and used to long covert missions, but if duty 
asked for them to fill in, so be it. They were professionals in that 
sense. Arika Yumemiya and Haruka Armitage were confirmed on the trip, as 
expected, sworn to defend their masters. Arika had raved and ranted 
about putting a stop to all the bloodshed, but her overwhelming passion 
and youth was quieted down by the rapidly maturing queen and the other 
Meister.

A Column member did indeed show up. Nao coolly looked at both Shizuru 
and Natsuki, who were giving her an expected look of surprise. Natsuki 
tapped her fingers on her desk. &quot;And your reason for going?&quot;

&quot;Bored out of my ever loving mind,&quot; Nao said.

The left side of Shizuru&#39;s mouth twitched up into a small smirk. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, we were looking for something along the lines of &#39;I want to help 
defend the supreme rulers of the twelve nations and possibly help 
improve life on Earth.&#39; I don&#39;t know, Natsuki, what do you think?&quot;

As Natsuki made a thoughtful noise and pretended to ponder the issue, 
Nao rolled her eyes. &quot;What in the hell. When did you two fur traders end 
up as my parents? Do I have to sign triplicate permission slips next? 
Give you a note that says Nao has been a very good girl and is free to 
go on a field trip?&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t tolerate that kind of attitude,&quot; Shizuru said. &quot;I&#39;m afraid 
you&#39;ll have to go to the corner for ten minutes so you learn your 
lesson.&quot;

Natsuki was surprised Shizuru did not volunteer to spank her. She 
twitched an eye when Nao spoke, echoing her thoughts. &quot;I&#39;m surprised you 
didn&#39;t make some smartass comment about spanking me, you pervert. Look, 
am I going or not? I don&#39;t have time for this.&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;re bored out of your mind, then surely you have too much free 
time,&quot; Natsuki countered.

&quot;Kruger, just write my name down on your little list and shut up,&quot; Nao 
demanded, her hands tightening into fists. Natsuki smirked from her 
desk, resting her chin against both of her hands, taking great 
satisfaction in irritating the hell out of someone who could have very 
well filled the void of sister. Her rivalry with Mai was one thing, but 
Nao fought back with ferocity. It made it all the more amusing.

Natsuki cleared her throat, moving to write a name down. &quot;Very well, you 
may go. Do remember that this is a mission of diplomacy, first and 
foremost. You&#39;ll have to be a well mannered woman. No swearing, no 
drinking, and no flipping off anyone who looks at you.&quot;

&quot;Well, just suck all the fun right out of it, will you?&quot;

She turned on her heel and marched out of the office, her mission 
finally accomplished. No need to hang around if they were just going to 
be wise asses all day long. Roughly twenty minutes later, another 
redhead, albeit of a more natural shade, slowly trudged into the office. 
Her face was downcast, not believing that she had gotten pushed into 
this kind of situation. That young (or not so young) companion of hers 
was nothing but trouble.

&quot;So, you&#39;re officially going?&quot; Natsuki asked.

Mai nodded her head once. &quot;It certainly looks that way. My status as an 
Otome Meister sort of obligates me to go and defend Mikoto, who&#39;s been 
bouncing all around incessantly since she saw the two ships fall. So 
much for being a hermit. Adventure calls.&quot;

Natsuki shook her head and put Mai&#39;s name on the list of confirmed 
volunteers. Mai, Natsuki and both of their onee-samas fighting together 
again. How sickeningly nostalgic. Perhaps the mission would prevent both 
sides from warring against each other, but she knew better. &quot;Well, you 
know you&#39;re always welcome, Tokiha. The additional support will no doubt 
come in handy.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully giant flames of death won&#39;t be necessary, but we&#39;ll see.&quot; 
With that, Mai sighed and said her farewells, heading back out the doors 
that lead into Natsuki&#39;s office. To be trusted with securing relations 
with the home world, and to defend all the diplomats from harm as a war 
between the Otome and these... HiME tore the place apart. No pressure 
there at all. She just had to let her GEM get swallowed by that silly 
immortal girl.

She was snapped from her train of thought by something that had been 
bugging her all day. She darted her eyes down the halls that lead up to 
her path, making sure no one was around. Then, confident that she was 
alone, she frantically scratched at her right breast, which had been 
itching and burning like hell all damn day. A red mark had been starting 
to appear. Mai whined in aggravation and then began to head down the 
hall. &quot;I hope I didn&#39;t get ringworm. For god sakes.&quot;

The ship that had landed outside Windbloom, belonging to the two Otome, 
was just large enough to seat all of them quite uncomfortably. It felt 
very much like a sardine can, but was otherwise good to go in terms of 
flight. It had survived the impact well, the two Y-Type Otome from Earth 
only having to repair a few minor things beforehand. They kept saying 
they had to go as soon as possible, which left the Earl natives with 
only two days of preparation time.

They were given little in terms of extra information. There were Five 
Columns on their world as well, who acted as the leaders of the Otome 
rather than just specialist agents to be used. Likewise, the HiME had 
their own elite time known as the Twelve. They were the strongest of 
their breed, wielding ancient and unique weapons and apparently having 
the ability to summon Slaves like the Schwarz agents they had 
encountered in the past.

The team of volunteers was all accounted for: Akira, Midori, Natsuki, 
Shizuru, Nao, Mai, Mikoto, Yukino, Haruka, Mashiro, and Arika. It was a 
motley crew, though for some reason they all felt quite comfortable 
around one another. No time for flight training. Izumi and Naomi left 
the surface regardless of the collective constitution of the people on 
board. Most were Otome and used to the feeling of high speed flight. The 
diplomats, however, paled and grew nauseous.

&quot;Oh, god, I&#39;m gonna hurl,&quot; Akira muttered, clutching her stomach as the 
g-forces shoved her back into her seat. Shizuru, sitting next to her, 
slid to the side as far as possible, tugging on her girlfriend&#39;s 
clothing as she (gracefully, of course) scrambled to get clear should 
there be any release of stomach fluid.

The gateway that had been used to get the Otome there in the first place 
was still active. Izumi turned back to explain. &quot;You will see blinding 
white before we emerge on the other side. That is basically a device to 
secure and maintain a wormhole. Instant transportation.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s a wormhole?&quot; Mashiro asked.

Too late. Izumi flew into it, and the universe around them was lost for 
several long moments, jaws dropping in shock and horror before space and 
its brilliant stars once returned. In front of them was a blue world 
vastly different from their own. It was covered in gray, dead clouds. 
The continents were white. The seas had lost the brilliant blue shade 
that had once been. Ripped metal floated around them, orbital 
installations long ago destroyed. Earth was, in essence, a dead and 
lifeless looking world.

Naomi turned back around, stating one simple command. &quot;Hang on.&quot;

Oh, they did &#150; for dear life. The ship shook and rocked as they broke 
through the atmosphere, flamings biting at the outer hull. After several 
minutes it finally broke through, heading back down to the surface and 
to a landing area that they had been shooting for in particular. An 
ancient and ruined city. Flashes in the distance represented explosions. 
Natsuki looked on, calculating the dangers.

&quot;This place was once called Kyoto,&quot; Izumi said. &quot;In the last few years, 
the war had taken center stage on these old and sacred grounds. The 
political leaders assemble here, however, underground in one of the old 
bunkers. No time for sight seeing. We&#39;ll take you to them immediately.&quot;

Good idea, Natsuki wryly thought. They hopped out of their seats and 
exited the vessel, stepping on to the cracked and frozen street below. 
How desolate looking this place was. Never the less, they followed 
behind the two native Otome as they escorted the visitors to a more 
private path, further away from danger and more secluded, running 
through archaic and abandoned buildings. A ghost town. They moved 
quickly and silently, the less athletic diplomats finding themselves 
winded.

When they stopped for a brief moment to let them recover, Mai looked 
skyward. Such dark and foreboding clouds. Had the sky there ever been 
clear and blue, or was Kyoto permanently tainted by such an atmosphere? 
As she took deep breaths to keep her body in the proper condition, she 
heard a dull rumble behind her. What? Looking up at the sky, a red 
glowing object caught her attention. It sailed through the skies, a 
faint screech become louder and louder.

&quot;Oh, god! The the First!&quot; Naomi hissed.

&quot;What?&quot; Natsuki demanded, following their glare. &quot;Explain.&quot;

&quot;The HiME are governed by The Twelve, their elite warriors. They can 
control those dark gods and forbidden weaponry. That&#39;s one up there. 
Quick take cover! In here!&quot; Izumi explained, running into one of the 
abandoned buildings. The others followed suit, watching whatever it was 
from their secure location, peering out a window.

The faint glow and rumble became a distinctly serpent like form, and the 
rumble became a full roar. The beast dove down from the sky and flew 
overhead, racing through the ruined skyscrapers, looking for victims. 
The monster passed right next to them with only a short distance to 
spare. Aboard him was a young woman, hanging onto his back while spirals 
so similar to Mai&#39;s danced around her wrists. A sharp intake of air into 
the monster&#39;s lungs forced them to cover their ears. It cleared the area 
and twisted its neck down. The blast that followed was deafening. A 
large stream of fire poured from its hungry mouth, taking out a small 
structure in the distance. Otome dressed in blue suits scrambled across 
the battlefield, their cover lost.

&quot;We&#39;re too late, they&#39;re already here,&quot; Naomi hissed to Izumi. &quot;We have 
to get back immediately. Let&#39;s get in there and support them!&quot;

&quot;But, what about...?&quot;

Naomi tossed her head back to their guests. &quot;You all stay here. Don&#39;t 
move unless you&#39;re about to be incinerated! We have a fixed Emulator 
here if you need to materialize. Help if you can, but it might be too 
much!&quot;

Oh, okay. The two Otome activate their Iolite GEMs, coating themselves 
in that same blue combat robe the other Earth warriors were wearing. 
They snuck out of the building and raced to help their comrades, while 
the visitors from Earl could only stare helplessly in shock. Well, time 
for robes. Could they even activate them? Mai and the others, without 
incident, summoned up their Otome robes, connecting to their Emulator, 
wherever it was.

&quot;Now what?&quot; Mai asked.

She was greeted by silence, no one really knowing how to answer that. 
The dragon and the Otome fought tooth and nail outside, the Iolites 
armed with the same kind of quarterstaves the Corals and Pearls used. 
They were amazed by the similarities between them. After several 
minutes, however, Natsuki heard something down a nearby street. She 
turned, staring at the buildings, seeing a shadow move. A screech of 
metal on asphalt, followed by a wounded howl.

&quot;Yafusa!&quot; Someone shrieked in the distance, clearly frightened. Another 
of the Twelve, then?

A dark metal animal limped into the street, lame and crippled in its 
movement. Blood red metal eyes accumulated targets. A solitary woman 
stood next to it, whatever that monstrosity was. One cannon was mounted 
on the left side of the creature&#39;s back, looking much like Natsuki&#39;s 
cannon Element, she thought. The right side of the beast looked as if 
something had been entirely ripped off, a large metal indentation left 
behind. The Slave-like animal hobbled whenever it had to use that side 
of its body. It groaned as it began its hunt, and let out one 
earth-shaking howl, full of pain and anguish.

Slowly and sure, the lame Slave fixed its wrathful eyes on where they 
were hiding. Without hesitation, a cartridge was inserted into the 
chamber of the massive cannon, the barrel pointing at where they were 
ducking down. Natsuki widened her eyes in fear and shock. Well, so much 
for a peaceful diplomacy mission.

&quot;Move!&quot; She ordered. They did so, the wolf howling yet again &#150; a battle 
cry.</pre>
