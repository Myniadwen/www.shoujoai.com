Kyoto, Japan
2021 AD

They were just outside Kyoto, and curiously at the same place where they 
had won a major battle against Searrs years before. This was where the 
original Five Columns had been defeated, and where Dr. Smith had been 
slain by a calculating Sugiura Midori. It had put an end to much of the 
difficulties faced by the HiME after the Carnival. Searrs ceased with 
its attempts to forcefully capture the hardened warriors. They&#39;d lost 
far too many men in the process. No, now Searrs was forced to do the 
underhanded and the dirty to get what they want. How typical of them, 
indeed! They had tried to finish Searrs off, but how could one team 
effectively do so? Their base, largely abandoned, was once again a 
hotbed of combat that evening.

You took my son.

A burst of bullets from an XM8 assault rifle slammed into a Searrs agent 
left to defend the base from attack. He wasn&#39;t particularly skilled, was 
he? Her blonde locks of hair began to gently glow as she suddenly 
vanished from view and reappeared behind the entire mob. Her only &#39;super 
ability&#39; and the only thing that made her fit to stand with the 
Ikusahime, despite being a hollow imitation. The moves had nearly left 
her breathless as a child. Now it was easier, but too much use of it 
would leave her fatigued. A stream of bullets left her XM8 and she 
followed that up with a single shot from it&#39;s grenade launcher. Bodies 
fell to the ground, and she was in no mood to care about any of them at 
this point. Her ability to care had long since left her.

You killed my husband.

She stepped over a corpse and into the building interior, where Miyu was 
already slashing through opposition with her sword arm and mowing down 
the rest with her built in gatling gun, switching between modes 
seamlessly and with little effort. Alyssa had done very well for herself 
in the field of robotics &#150; even landing a job with Omron in the last 
couple years to head up their new division dedicated to the growing 
industry. Her skills were used to improve Miyu&#39;s OS and hardware to the 
point where she was far more capable than she&#39;d been during the 
Carnival. Alyssa had removed all of her malicious programming. There 
were no more surprises. She was no longer multiple, in that there would 
never be another copy of her. Alyssa had upgraded her OS with a new 
purpose &#150; to protect. Merciful Intelligent Yggdrasil Unit. But 
obviously, as it stood, Alyssa was not feeling particularly merciful 
herself. She had no reason to be merciful to these bastards.

You baited my sister into a trap.

Miyu cleared the way and stormed into the next room to make sure it was 
remotely safe for her darling ojou-sama. Alyssa stepped into the cold, 
metallic room and bounded down a flight of stairs that led deeper into 
the complex. Far below was where Midori had killed Alyssa&#39;s biological 
father. To the north was where Ruby had snapped and was subsequently 
defeated by Natsuki and Shizuru. Alyssa had never been to the building 
herself. It already felt haunted. Was she too late, then?

She heard movement behind her and Miyu spun around to take care of the 
would-be ambusher. But Alyssa was already on top of it. She dropped the 
rifle behind her head and fired blindly. She felt blood splatter and 
heard the sickening sound of metal tearing through meat. Her gun clicked 
as the magazine ran out of ammunition. A thud followed. She turned her 
head to see a red headed man bleeding on the ground, already dead. She 
ejected the empty magazine with a robot-like calm more befitting the 
creation than the creator. She fastened the rifle to her shoulder and 
pulled out her secondary weapon &#150; a single black Desert Eagle. Both 
weapons had been &#39;borrowed&#39; from her onee-chan.

&quot;Child detected approximately three hundred meters to the west and one 
more floor below,&quot; Miyu informed after her sensors, originally built by 
Searrs to find and eliminate the HiME, scanned the area in hopes of 
saving them from destruction.

Alyssa barreled down another flight of stairs with Miyu on her tail. 
Alyssa fired a shot at one more guard using her sister&#39;s Desert Eagle 
(which was lovingly referred to as Lefty). She had to hurry if they were 
summoning Children now, though it did serve as proof that they were, at 
least for now, alive. She ran into a small hallway, and on the right 
hand side there was a series of glass windows that looked in on a 
research lab. She skidded to a halt at what she saw within. Many armed 
guards, of course, but... there was Julia Araneae in all her spider 
glory, bound by rope and held in place. Nao, Natsuki and Shizuru were 
locked in vertical containment devices. There were twelve places in 
total, of course... but the others were worryingly empty.

Alyssa frantically searched for a door. The other end. She sprinted, and 
attempted to activate it, but found that it was locked from the inside. 
Dammit!

The room was soundproof, but an intercom clicked on and she saw the 
smirking face of a dark haired westerner facing her &#150; no doubt Dr. 
Smith&#39;s replacement. He spoke to her in German, which was probably his 
native tongue, as it was Alyssa&#39;s. Searrs was headquartered in Bavaria. 
&quot;Ah, it looks as if we have an audience! How wonderful to see you, my 
sweet Alyssa! You are in time for the finale.&quot;

&quot;Open the fucking door, you coward!&quot; Alyssa screamed, slamming her fist 
down on the metal barrier.

He shook his finger at her. &quot;Now, now, you mustn&#39;t use such foul 
language. It&#39;s most unbecoming for a lady such as yourself. Please just 
sit back and watch like a mature adult.&quot;

&quot;Miyu, break the window!&quot; Her voice was loud and already ragged. The 
android under her command did as instructed, punching her fist against 
the glass only to be rebuffed. It was bulletproof and several inches 
thick, apparently. There was no fracture. Miyu punched again. And again. 
And again! A fracture, a dent, snapping glass... all so slowly. Miyu&#39;s 
hand was bleeding, but she didn&#39;t feel it. The synthetic flesh could be 
replaced.

Where are the other HiME?!

&quot;Please, gentlemen, if you will...&quot;

The director of research gave the orders, and one of the guards pointed 
his rifle straight at Yuuki Nao, whose eyes were wide with fear and 
perhaps a lifetime of regrets as she squirmed against her bonds and 
attempted to free herself. Her desperate green eyes met Alyssa&#39;s 
helpless blue ones for just a fleeting moment before the gunshots went 
off. Bullets entered Nao&#39;s unprotected body and the HiME lurched 
forward, blood dripping from the wounds. As they were all susceptible to 
a new Emulator that was somewhere on base, the HiME acted as if the 
Obsidian Lord were truly still in existence. And the rule of the 
Carnival? If you kill the HiME, you kill both the Key and the Child 
along with her. Both Nao and Julia were outlined in green before they 
turned to puffs of smoke, the essence of which was trapped and recorded 
digitally onto a storage device. Capturing the Obsidian Lord&#39;s raw data 
for themselves!

The Obsidian Lord was still nothing more than a machine, albeit a 
semi-sentient one. Searrs had known that for years. Alyssa had been told 
that before the Last Carnival. The Lord had everything stored in its 
massive body. The HiME Elements, the Children &#150; everything. When the 
Carnival was active... that raw data was transferred to the HiME 
themselves, which meant that all of Alyssa&#39;s loved ones and friends were 
the last to possess such exotic information encoded into their very 
blood. The Searrs Emulator could only store new data such as the Otome 
Column equipment. They desperately wanted that original information so 
they could perfect their new creations. Ruby was only a shallow 
imitation of Mai. They wanted more power. They wanted the real thing. 
For that... well, they needed Mai. All the rest had their purposes.

&quot;And now for that last, final chain reaction. It&#39;s always so very 
interesting when two HiMEs are Keys of one another!&quot; He stated over the 
intercom for Alyssa to hear. She looked over at Miyu. Still not through! 
Ther had to be something that Alyssa could do! She flipped open the 
controls to the door and attempted to hack into it. She was not Yukino, 
but she was skilled regardless. Tears threatened to blur her vision.

&quot;We&#39;ve preserved a great deal,&quot; he began to say. &quot;The Elements which 
your friends use will be key weapons in the future. Tokiha-san&#39;s Inferno 
Spirals. Munakata-san&#39;s flute, which will be the basis for a weapon 
based on the power of music... and, Kuga-san, we feel that your Child 
can offer us a wonderful new Element for one of our existing GEMs.&quot;

Natsuki spat in his face. Alyssa couldn&#39;t help but smirk. The elder 
sister spoke in his own language, German being the only foreign tongue 
she knew. &quot;Crawl back into the asshole you were born from.&quot;

He wiped his face clean and sighed. &quot;Such a barbarian. Smith was right 
to warn everyone about you, his first little abomination.&quot; He snapped 
his fingers. &quot;Bring in Yafusa.&quot;

A pair of large doors opened in the back of the room, Alyssa thought 
(still concentrating on that door!), and head the yelping squeals of 
Yafusa as he was drug in, bound by metal chain. The Child, great in size 
compared with his previous diminutive form of yesteryear, struggled 
desperately and lashed out with his teeth and claws at anyone nearby. A 
guard was slammed against the wall with such force that his ribs 
cracked. Yafusa was at last held in place by both machines and men, the 
director moving over to him and running his hands along Yafusa&#39;s belly, 
as if he were petting a golden retriever. Metal clamps were soon 
attached to one of his mighty cannon emplacements. The wolf groaned in 
justified fear.

&quot;Duran!&quot; Natsuki shouted, and her eyes darted from Shizuru to the wolf 
and back again. &quot;I swear to whatever god is listening that when I get 
out of this, I&#39;m going to make you wish you were never born, you little 
prick!&quot;

Come on, come on! Alyssa pleaded with the door. Such tight security! She 
wasn&#39;t used to this. She needed a more experienced hacker. Miyu wasn&#39;t 
capable of decoding things to that level, as her skills were only as 
powerful as the programmer&#39;s. That window wasn&#39;t ready to give all the 
way yet, either. Fucking shit!

&quot;Extract the weapon.&quot; No, just another second!

There was a low hiss of machinery as the clamps pulled on the gun turret 
with enough force to rip it clean off Duran&#39;s back. There was a light 
green haze followed by a horrible, gut wrenching howl from Duran 
himself. Alyssa shot her eyes up and saw Shizuru squirming and crying 
out, her own arm feeling as if it was ripped off from the bond she 
shared with the creature. Duran curled into a ball and Shizuru went 
limp, tears having escaped her eyes. Natsuki yelled out profanities and 
fought against her bonds, but to no avail.

&quot;No need to bring Kiyohime out. Such is the fun part of having two HiMEs 
bound to each other.&quot; The director turned to his coworkers and pointed 
at Shizuru. &quot;It matters not which one you kill. Both will go. Pick 
whatever target you&#39;d like and fire at will.&quot;

An incredibly desperate attempt to stretch fingers out far enough to 
where they could get one last feel of each other&#39;s flesh. Hasty and 
heartfelt mumblings of &#39;aishiteru&#39;s and other such sweet words. Alyssa 
was on the brink of a breakdown as she continued to try her luck with 
the door. She finished writing the code, she went to execute... fuck 
all! Error?! Alyssa stood up and pounded on the door again. &quot;Onee-chan!&quot;

Natsuki&#39;s eyes tore from Shizuru&#39;s for just a moment to look at Alyssa, 
and instantly filled with more tears. No one deserved to see this happen 
to their newfound sister, after all. Those green eyes pleaded with 
Alyssa to run as fast as her legs would carry her. Alyssa just stood in 
place, crying out time and time again for them to stop what they were 
doing. Miyu&#39;s hand finally broke through glass. She attempted to pull it 
free. The clicking of rifles. Natsuki turned her gaze back to Shizuru 
and for a moment, Alyssa thought she smiled.

A volley of gunfire, and the two found themselves as nothing more than 
misty green smoke for the second time. Alyssa wailed and clawed at the 
door like an animal as Duran vanished as well, all energies stored away 
and gathered like precious raw materials. The spice must flow? She 
punched at the door and hissed out swear words in multiple languages as 
the men retreated into another room and left the present one barren.

&quot;Ojou-sama, there are soldiers heading our way,&quot; Miyu warned, turning 
away from the glass and pointing her gatling gun down the hall. &quot;We 
should run. Your son may still be in danger even with Dragunova-sama.&quot;

Her precious son, Radulf Sayers, was somewhere over China by now, 
heading to Russia with Shizuru&#39;s aunt Tanya, who&#39;d gone out of her way 
to ensure that he was taken somewhere barren and out of the way. They 
were en route to a small airport in Yakutia, and Alyssa would link up 
with them later. Kyoto was simply too dangerous for anyone HiME related. 
The number of deaths almost overwhelmed her. The HiME, Haruka, Takumi... 
everyone! Haruka had been at Alyssa&#39;s side earlier, doing what Haruka 
did best. But now... up in smoke like all the others.

Miyu was forced to grab her by the shoulder and drag her along like a 
dead weight, or thereabouts, as the android stormed through the facility 
and fled into the night. Alyssa would certainly not forget. She had 
failed in her quest to save them... but the very least she could do was 
have her revenge. She would get herself a list of all those responsible 
for the Otome project, and slay them one by one. They would not continue 
their damned manipulation of nature. They would suffer for their torture 
and execution of the twelve greatest women ever to live. Of that, Alyssa 
swore.

- - -

She couldn&#39;t help but feel like it was all her fault.

Alyssa felt like such a failure, having discovered that her child was 
missing and that Searrs had left her a nice little ransom message that 
essentially stated &#39;give us the HiME or we will kill your two week old 
son.&#39; Hadn&#39;t even noticed anyone breaking in! And then what did she do? 
She sprinted straight for her sister&#39;s house, her husband close behind 
her asking what was going on, and marched right up the stairs. There she 
grabbed up several guns and was prepared to take on all of Searrs by 
herself. It was when she tried to leave that both Shizuru and Natsuki 
cornered her, asking what the fuss was about.

She went from vengeful mother to blubbering idiot in the span of three 
seconds. Alyssa had been determined as she tried to leave, but one look 
at her sister&#39;s concerned face and she fell to the ground with tears 
dripping from her face and her voice enslaved by unyielding sobs and 
lamentations. It had taken several long minutes to get the story out, 
all while Shizuru gently cradled her and tried to wipe away her tears, 
though more replaced the ones taken away.

Apparently reactions are similar with blood relatives, because Natsuki 
went upstairs, grabbed her Python revolvers, and left. The others tore 
after her, and within the span of three hours, Natsuki had the entire 
damned HiME crew assembled and ready for a mission to rescue her nephew. 
It was trap, and a very obvious one, but they all went in anyway.

Shizuru and Natsuki were at the vanguard. Miyu and Alyssa were close 
behind. Even Nao was more than willing to help, curiously livid at the 
enemy despite her usual apathy for other people and their suffering. 
Fumi-san as well, who stepped into the combat arena for the first time 
in years simply because she was so appalled at what had happened.

They all went in, but only Shizuru and Natsuki came back briefly. 
Natsuki was holding her nephew in her arms, Shizuru escorting her back 
to Alyssa. &quot;Get out of here and get him somewhere safe,&quot; she had 
ordered. Alyssa did so, leaving her son to Tanya Dragunova, who agreed 
to take him up to Siberia to avoid capture.

Alyssa returned to the battle as soon as humanly possible, Miyu at her 
side, but by then it was too late. Even Yukino had been captured, as she 
was the last to transmit a message before a deathly radio silence took 
over the airwaves that had been populated just a tad bit earlier by 
combat chatter. And then she had been too late... too late to save the 
sister she had only recently bonded with and grown close to. Too late to 
save people she would genuinely call her friend. Nao and Shizuru, who 
were both horrible influences in their own ways, to the always 
optimistic Midori... all of them! Now they were all dead, and it was 
because of her.

She took a quick trip to Yakutia to check on her son. There, she 
gathered all necessary information to hunt down the people who had done 
such horrible acts. She gathered support from very different groups, all 
related to the HiME in one way or another. Shizuru&#39;s male cousins, 
Akira&#39;s ninja clan, and Midori&#39;s childhood friends (who referred to 
Midori as &#39;Red,&#39; while their still-in-use nicknames were various other 
Sentai colors). Many people from many walks of life.

Her army started at thirty strong. Then forty. As she discovered more 
and more people who&#39;d lost loved ones to Searrs, it grew and grew. 
People with HiME blood volunteered. At it&#39;s maximum size, her little 
army was made up of one hundred and twenty three people. It was almost 
unbelievable to see a group that size oppose something so fast. They 
were a secret guerrilla army. They had no names and no destiny. Many 
were fond of that.

Hell, she even had a unit of warrior nuns at one point. &quot;Call us 
paladins. The lord god would support the capping of these bitches to 
avenge the injustice done upon Sister Yukariko!&quot; Utterly nuts at times.

And she was their grand and glorious leader, wasn&#39;t she? Ruthless, 
brilliant, and deadly efficient.

- - -

She went by the alias of Katrin Sayers. With that name, she slowly but 
surely began to kill off each member of the team rumored to be a part of 
the Otome project. Katrin Sayers became a &#39;merciless yakuza boss&#39; in 
Kyoto that made subtle headlines about near-terrorist level activity. 
The police were after her. The JSDF was after her. She always managed to 
slip away just to strike again. Akira&#39;s family proved to be a group of 
great importance to her. They, trained from birth to fight and to kill, 
could easily sneak into guarded locations and make quick work of 
whatever heartless Searrs officer rested within. Alyssa herself was 
getting quite good at the same thing.

They would never admit it, of course, but Searrs came so very close to 
disbanding because of that little golden angel they had created. For 
many months, she was unstoppable. Every senior official, even those she 
had been taught to respect... yes, their wild creature had finally and 
truly turned on them all. Where she found them, she put a bullet through 
their head. Her subordinates destroyed property and supplies belonging 
to the Foundation. Kyoto, Tokyo, Kobe... her reach spread from Japan and 
onto the mainland. The Chinese bases were hit. Some of the Russian ones. 
Golden angel of death.

She gathered more and more support from people who were born with HiME 
blood but had not manifested powers during the Carnival &#150; HiME Heirs, 
they were called. Her following swelled. She herself became a walking 
legend to those who knew her. She was fearless, and she fought on equal 
standing with those she technically commanded. She did not shy away from 
the horrors of fighting simply because of her rank. She was right there 
with them.

Searrs feared her and with good reason. But Alyssa&#39;s luck could not 
prevent the inevitable. Not even a year after she had started her covert 
rebellion, it was soon crumbling away as the Foundation found one very 
effective way of getting rid of her and her mortal companions. She 
remembered, quite clearly, turning on the news that morning.

&quot;In hopes of dealing with the growing yakuza threat to our society, the 
JSDF has ordered top of the line combat suits designed specifically for 
females. Five volunteers will make up the group, known as the &#39;Column&#39; 
unit. These combat suits will protect the wearers from almost all 
attacks and allow them to return fire with greater efficiency than 
regular gear.&quot;

She let out a long sigh and turned to Miyu, who sat next to her in front 
of the television. &quot;They still have the GEMs, all of which are probably 
enhanced with the... information they acquired. Miyu, you&#39;re the only 
one who can stand against them. Apart from defending me, your goal will 
be to destroy the GEMs and stop the Otome in their tracks. We can&#39;t 
have... they aren&#39;t meant to be in this world. No more than I am.&quot;

Miyu looked sadly at her charge, who had never truly recovered from the 
repeated torment she had faced during her childhood. She had been raised 
and used as a weapon, then tossed aside when she became useless. All so 
they could try and mimic something that should not have been mimicked. 
And yet Miyu did not understand how Alyssa did not grasp that it was she 
who ended the Carnival cycle. Without a thirteenth HiME, it never would 
have been possible. It pained Miyu that Alyssa thought herself a villain 
rather than a hero.

&quot;I can&#39;t fight on even standing with the Columns,&quot; Alyssa admitted. &quot;You 
may be able to. The Heirs and our other friends will be cannon fodder 
for them, although I expect no one with HiME blood will rest if there&#39;s 
an Otome in the world. Not anymore.&quot;

&quot;What do you want me to tell them, ojou-sama?&quot;

&quot;I want to leave them a message. Record it for me in your memory. That 
way you&#39;ll have video and audio of me saying it quite clearly.&quot; Alyssa 
said. &quot;A message for the group, and then a private message for my loved 
ones. I truly don&#39;t expect to live through this.&quot;

&quot;Public message. Begin recording.&quot;

Alyssa straightened herself and began to speak, trying her best to look 
strong and professional. That all amounted to feeling like the Queen of 
England on a holiday speech. She almost slipped into the accent. &quot;I want 
to thank all of you for putting your lives on the line to stop the 
Foundation from continuing its cruel acts against humanity. It has been 
made public that the army has purchased an Otome Columns unit for 
themselves, which means that Searrs&#39; elite fighters are once again 
active with new soldiers. I will keep on fighting, but as these women 
are incredibly dangerous, I beg you all to lay down your arms and return 
to your normal lives. Your dedication to the cause is admirable enough 
as it is, and I don&#39;t want to see anyone else hurt on my account. I 
thank you from the bottom of my heart. Together, we have accomplished so 
very much. I&#39;m very proud of everyone.&quot;

Thus ended Alyssa&#39;s message to her fellow soldiers, and Miyu ceased 
recording. She felt like such an idiot! She put a hand to her face and 
tried to stop blushing, but she feared that it would never go away in 
time for her second message. Miyu did not waste any time. &quot;Private 
message. Begin recording.&quot;

Alyssa shifted nervously in her seat and hoped the blush was gone. 
Damned Natsuki genes.

- - -

The young blonde and Miyu were walking down a quiet street on their way 
home. Home was a motel in downtown Kyoto, and would likely change again 
and again as time went on. Her previous home was no longer safe. They 
had closed in on it time after time, and Miyu finally just forced Alyssa 
to leave. With her, she took Natsuki&#39;s arsenal. One of those black 
Desert Eagles was always in her possession. It was necessary. Especially 
on such a night.

They were halfway there when two women in peculiar JSDF uniforms made it 
their prerogative to stand in the middle of the street and prevent them 
from going any further. Alyssa watched them with mild amusement at 
first. They looked nothing like the badasses she had expected! Then 
again, Yukino and Midori didn&#39;t look particularly threatening either.

&quot;Katrin Sayers, lay down your arms immediately and surrender yourself to 
us,&quot; the &#39;leader&#39; called.

She held up her hands in mock surrender, but said. &quot;Miyu, you heard the 
woman. Present your weapons to them.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ojou-sama.&quot;

Two different materializations at once. The Lovely Onyx and the Ice 
Silver Crystal, now with brand new users. Miyu shot forward before they 
could call on their Elements, slashing out with her arm blade and 
forcing them to barely duck under it. Onyx leapt back and called upon 
her pole-axe, returning the gesture. Miyu blocked it with her own weapon 
and kicked her back, only to switch modes and follow up with a blast 
from her gatling gun. Onyx recovered and sprinted out of the way, 
blocking stray bullets with her Element until she was in the clear.

The Ice Silver Crystal came right for Alyssa, and the blonde found 
herself in a hand to hand duel with the other female. The Otome was so 
fast! It was hard to keep up. Alyssa was still, after all her 
experience, in a lower league than the true HiME or the Otome. Alyssa 
managed to hold her own for some time, blocking hits and returning some 
of her own. She took a punch to the face and hit the ground, causing 
Miyu to glide over at breakneck speed, using her sword arm to scratch 
the robe of the treacherous new Crystal. Crystal jumped back, which gave 
enough room for Alyssa to use her onee-chan&#39;s gun.

Alyssa fired multiple shots until her wrist began to sting, but the 
Otome dodged them all. She growled in frustration as she got to her 
feet. Miyu again attacked with her gatling gun, and Alyssa could hear 
screams and sirens in the distance. No, this wasn&#39;t cover at all, was 
it? The new Onyx leapt forward and tried to land a vertical slash 
against Miyu, but the android avoided it with ease. Another shot on 
Alyssa&#39;s part. The bullet hit, but bounced off, though it generated a 
good yelp from the Onyx Otome.

&quot;Ojou-sama!&quot; A call in the distance. Two members of Akira&#39;s family were 
rushing in to help. The first attacked with a tanto blade, but the Ice 
Silver Crystal simply grabbed him and hurled him into the side of one of 
the nearby buildings. He was knocked out cold.

The other attempted to strike her down with what would have otherwise 
been a textbook perfect roundhouse. Crystal grabbed his leg and twisted 
it, and he found himself face first on the ground. Crystal then formed a 
rather large and hefty weapon in her hands. That... was not Crystal&#39;s 
normal Element! The old one had used a shotgun. This was a fucking piece 
of mobile artillery! It... Alyssa paused for just a moment. That was 
Duran&#39;s cannon! Those damned assholes! She gritted her teeth and began 
to head in, firing her Eagle. The robe again took the hits. Alyssa then 
found herself motionless &#150; stopped right in her tracks. She hadn&#39;t even 
seen the flash of light that had occurred moments before. Or perhaps she 
had, and was still stricken by it. She did hear, however, the cry from 
Miyu.

&quot;Ojou-sama!&quot;

She knew full well that Miyu was running towards her, and could hear 
metal sinking into flesh from Miyu having stabbed Crystal in response to 
the move. All Alyssa could focus on, however, was her own body as she so 
very slowly looked down and noticed that most of her abdomen was 
missing. Oh, look mom, I&#39;m see-through. She found it very amusing in a 
juvenile kind of way. Funny. It didn&#39;t even hurt. Perhaps because part 
of her spine was missing with it. She brought a hand to the wound, and 
felt a horrible sting. Her body then collapsed on the ground, and she 
watched as Miyu fought with a wounded Crystal and a full functional and 
aggressive Onyx.

She laughed. Oh, very ironic! Killed by the weapon that had belong to 
her beloved sister&#39;s Child! She laughed bitterly until her voice gave 
out on her. The Otome fled, though it was not exactly a victory on 
Miyu&#39;s part. The android slid to her knees and pulled Alyssa into an 
embrace. Ah, but it was all okay. Alyssa had made her peace and said her 
goodbyes before hand.

Perhaps she should be nostalgic and ask Miyu to build her another 
snowman. No, that had been done. Oh, yes, I&#39;ve been in this position 
once before, haven&#39;t I? She looked up at her guardian and smiled, 
praying that Miyu would store that image and not beat herself up about 
it. It had largely been Alyssa&#39;s choice, after all. She could have gone 
into hiding like Tanya and Radulf. She trusted that the Russian woman 
would take very good care of that son of hers. Perhaps better than a far 
too young Alyssa could have.

Sky blue eyes became dull and lifeless, and Miyu once again found 
herself mourning the loss of that beautiful golden angel who had brought 
so much joy to her life.

Miyu, ageless and ever observant, watched over the next several 
centuries and more and more nations enlisted the Otome for help. More 
GEMs, countless GEMs, were created. X-Types and Y-Types! They were 
everywhere. And she knew that at some point, it was all going to 
crumble. It certainly did. A war between two nations in South American 
prompted the Otome there to nearly wipe the continent clean from their 
dueling. All major structures were destroyed and more and more of them 
joined in the fight. It went on for so long that the HiME Heirs, who had 
been hunted for their priceless blood, once again rebelled.

They naturally fought in the name of the &#39;Ojou-sama.&#39; Their ancestors 
had done well to tell such fanciful stories to their children over the 
course of generations.

The world was left in ruin from the multiple HiME versus Otome wars to 
follow in rapid succession. Most of the population sided with the Otome, 
as they were used to their presence, but many found home with the 
underdogs. The entire globe chose one side or the other. Soon, Searrs 
was forced to reform into Schwarz because of the stresses of managing 
all their new units, and it was they who led the way to the stars.

It was to avoid nuclear winter, actually, and the rich and powerful 
would be allowed on. Students from the Dammerung Otome Academy (financed 
by Schwarz, of course) would be present to act as guardians. It was 
there, on board a ship to Lalande, that Miyu noticed the first pair of 
HiME to be reborn. Minagi Mikoto and Himeno Fumi &#150; the spitting images 
of the original bodies. It was a relief beyond all measure. Perhaps one 
day... one day she would see her Ojou-sama again.

Miyu found herself on a new world, now named Earl, and it was there she 
watched over Alyssa&#39;s descendants. The legendary Rena Sayers. The clumsy 
but kind hearted Arika Yumemiya. All those that had come before them. 
Miyu would protect her Ojou-sama&#39;s line for as long as her ancient 
robotic body would allow. It was, after all, her prime directive.

And, upon contact being reestablished, she would return to Earth to 
finally see the end of Alyssa&#39;s long and torturous story. It was there 
she came across the weeping doppleganger of Fujino Shizuru, reborn as a 
high ranking member of the Otome in some sick twist of fate. It was 
there that Miyu was determined to make her last stand and, with the 
reborn Ikusahime, finally put and end to the organizations that made her 
Ojou-sama feel such intense pain.

Alyssa: &quot;Oh, I&#39;ll be reborn again. Yeah. As Tweety Bird, god damn it! 
What are you laughing about? Come over here. I&#39;ll peck your eyes out! 
Wussy!&quot;

Natsuki: &quot;Hahaha. You fail.&quot;

Alyssa: &quot;Go blush yourself.&quot;
