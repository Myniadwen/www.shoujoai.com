<h1>Mai HiMACE (part 2 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../maiotome/index.html">Mai Otome</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/226.html">22671991</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../maiotome/himace-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The next morning, Natsuki woke in a strange bed. Well, not exactly 
strange, just not her own. She certainly recognised it, however; 
recognised the soft satin sheets in deep, cherry pink, and the soft 
reddish d&eacute;cor of the entire bedroom from top to bottom. The familiar low 
table that sat beside the head of the bed, even, and the heavy hardwood 
door, painted to match the frame, with polished brass handle.

She lay on her back, as was usual, in a rather suggestive pose with one 
hand laid across her forehead and one knee bent, leg cocked to the side 
in a most evocative manner. She had apparently kicked off the thin red 
sheets during her short sleep, as they lay bunched up on the floor in a 
messy heap, and now she was bare to the world as it were. A slight chill 
shivered through her as the softest of breezes played across her naked 
skin.

All of a sudden, the door creaked slowly open and part of a head peeked 
through. Natsuki hurled a pillow at it, screeching sharply and grasping 
for some kind of cover.

&quot;Feeling a little shy this morning, love?&quot; Shizuru&#39;s familiar mellow 
&#39;morning voice&#39; murmured through the still-open door with a soft 
chuckle. When the door opened a second time, Natsuki failed to protest 
beyond merely turning her head in a gesture of disregard towards the 
tall older woman who entered and pulled the sheet that was still half on 
the floor tighter up against her chest in an attempt to cover her 
nudity.

Shizuru was, unsurprisingly, almost as naked as she, clad only in a long 
and very thin pink robe with soft red puffs around the edges. It was as 
thin and light as to be almost translucent, silk no doubt, and it was 
deliberately left hanging open in front as to show off everything from 
the inner edges of those generously curved thighs, right up to the 
brown-haired woman&#39;s throat. Somehow, only the very edge of a nipple was 
readily visible peeking out from behind the material, even as she moved, 
though anything down below was boldly open to observation. Clasped in 
both hands and held up against her stomach, as if to emphasise her 
breasts just above even further, was a small silver tray arrayed with a 
simple clay tea set and two large, filled, steaming bowls. She smiled 
warmly and set the tray on that low table beside the bed before leaning 
right down to kiss Natsuki&#39;s cheek.

Natsuki blushed deeply as the robe fell completely open right before her 
eyes, but said nothing. Her eyes slid down to her lap and stayed there 
as an expression of minor discomfort steadily coalesced upon her face.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot;

Shizuru stood up straight again, pointedly failing to fasten her robe 
which now fell to either side of her modestly large bust. &quot;What do you 
mean?&quot; she asked, a deep feeling of worry starting to build within her.

&quot;Tokiha Mai,&quot; said Natsuki with something of a hiss, though repressed. 
&quot;Tokiha Mai is a Hime. And now she&#39;s sheltering that...&quot;

&quot;Mikoto,&quot; Shizuru supplied when it became obvious the younger woman was 
not prepared to say the name herself. &quot;And yes, you&#39;re right. I didn&#39;t 
tell you.&quot; She sighed deeply. &quot;I knew, and I didn&#39;t tell you.&quot;

Natsuki looked irritable, though her voice gave nothing away. &quot;Why not? 
Can&#39;t you trust me?&quot;

Shizuru winced inwardly. &quot;Mikoto was injured, severely. Her survival was 
my responsibility, as the department director. I have to have a 
confidential relationship with the patients, just like any doctor or 
nurse below me.&quot; She paused, looking down at the dark-haired girl 
hesitantly. &quot;Wait...you tried to kill her, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Natsuki barked, just a little sharper than she had intended, and 
Shizuru jumped back slightly. She bit her anger back down with a slow 
breath. &quot;I did exactly as you said, I pursued her. I tried to get her to 
go back to Fuuka where she&#39;d be safe.&quot;

&quot;And you might just possibly have caused her serious bodily injury in 
the process...&quot;

Natsuki bristled. &quot;...I might have had a little trouble restraining 
myself during a fight. But I know it wasn&#39;t me who gave her that stomach 
wound.&quot;

Shizuru smiled ruefully, shaking her head and holding her hands up in a 
gesture of defeat. &quot;I guess you&#39;re just a feisty kind of girl, when it 
comes down to it. Not that that&#39;s necessarily a bad thing, in the right 
context.&quot;

Instead of blushing as usual, Natsuki turned her head and stared down at 
the bed-sheets so intensely that it might not have been so surprising 
had they burst into flames. Shizuru winced again, physically this time.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Natsuki?&quot;

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have,&quot; said Natsuki slowly. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have used it 
without your permission. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Shizuru shook her head with an indulgent giggle. &quot;Nonsense. You know I 
don&#39;t mind...Natsuki?&quot;

&quot;I should go,&quot; said the younger girl, shifting herself out of bed, away 
from Shizuru. A hand briefly rested on her shoulder but she shrugged it 
off.

&quot;Natsuki...&quot;

&quot;I,&quot; interjected the dark-haired woman in a hushed tone. &quot;I need to go. 
It was...nice meeting you again...Fujino-san.&quot;

Shizuru let her arm fall by her side and watched that naked back as 
Natsuki plucked her riding suit from its resting place folded across the 
back of one of the wooden chairs, arranged neatly around the breakfast 
table. She watched, silently, while the lavender-haired girl stepped 
into the thick boots, sleek black material caressing its way leisurely 
up that toned young body until all from her throat downward was 
completely obscured. The gloves went on last and Natsuki stood there for 
a short while, seeming lost in thought over something.

&quot;I should probably investigate further,&quot; she retorted, in a subdued 
tone. Then she left, without another word, and all the older woman could 
do was to sigh wistfully as she watched her sliding out of the open 
doorway.

Once her lover had disappeared, Shizuru poured herself a fresh cup of 
tea, sipped, and tried to make herself stop feeling so depressed. &quot;It&#39;s 
just a phase, really,&quot; she said for the nth time to the empty bedroom. 
&quot;I just did something that upset her, that&#39;s all. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have it 
fixed again in no time.&quot;

The small grey rectangle sitting on her bedside table started making an 
obnoxious bleeping noise at her. She sighed. &quot;Duty calls once more.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mikoto rubbed her cheek into her pillow again and sighed contentedly, 
squeezing her arms round the pillow&#39;s generous mid-section. It was 
definitely her favourite pillow ever, this one; so warm and soft and 
spongy, it just cried out to have her head resting over it. Although, on 
occasion, if she left her head on it for too long it might misshape and 
she&#39;d end up her head sandwiched between two thick mounds, which of 
course, wasn&#39;t all that bad barring the way her chin would then be 
resting on a much stiffer surface underneath.

&quot;Mikoto,&quot; Mai whined from somewhere above her, her voice resonating 
through Mikoto&#39;s head. &quot;I have to go to work.&quot;

The young girl squeezed tighter around Mai&#39;s waist and shook her head 
slowly, trying not to disturb her state of half-sleep. &quot;Nuh...stay...&quot; 
she remonstrated in a semi-conscious mumble.

Mai groaned, trying to work the light red colouring out of her cheeks, 
which was much more difficult when a young girl was nuzzling into her 
chest like that. &quot;If you don&#39;t let me up, I can&#39;t make breakfast.&quot;

Mikoto narrowed her eyes thoughtfully and pouted. &quot;But...&quot; she began, 
then trailed off. Breakfast...pillow...some decisions should never have 
to be made. Mai interrupted her young roommate&#39;s train of thought by 
prying the clinging girl off herself, and wriggled her way lethargically 
out of bed. Mikoto kneeled up on the bed, still half-asleep by the look 
of her, and watched the older girl sliding the bedroom door open.

Mai did indeed end up cooking breakfast yet again, sadly only two bowls 
of ramen, but let it not be said that Mai&#39;s ramen were not better than 
even the finest gourmet cuisine (according to some). Mikoto practically 
inhaled her bowlful, and Mai was once more baffled by the young girl&#39;s 
sheer appetite.

&quot;So,&quot; she began a little hesitantly. &quot;...was it as good as the last 
one?&quot;

Mikoto nodded so hard that Mai thought the poor girl&#39;s head might fall 
off. &quot;Mai&#39;s cooking is the best!&quot; she announced with an enormous grin.

&quot;Well I&#39;m going to work early today, so I can buy more food and cook 
more for you.&quot; She poked Mikoto&#39;s narrow mid-section with a finger, 
eliciting a yelp. &quot;And on Tuesday, I have to go see someone about 
getting you into school.&quot;

Mikoto whined loudly. &quot;Why do I have to go to school?&quot;

&quot;Because you&#39;re a young girl and you need an education if...&quot; Mai 
paused. &quot;Because shut up! You&#39;re going to school whether you like it or 
not!&quot;

&quot;No! I wanna stay here with you!&quot;

&quot;If you want to stay here with me, you&#39;ll have to work for money, so you 
need educating! So you&#39;re going to school!&quot; Mai set her empty bowl 
firmly down on the table with a resolved nod. &quot;And that&#39;s that.&quot;

&quot;Couldn&#39;t you just get a better job?&quot;

Both girls turned toward the doorway. Natsuki stood in the open 
apartment door, leaning casually against the wooden frame with her arms 
crossed over her chest, her leather gleaming in the morning sun. She 
looked frightfully alert and awake for such an early hour, vibrant 
almost, slivers of almost blue-ish purple flashing in her hair under the 
growing sunlight. Her dull blue-green eyes peered across the room at the 
redhead with contempt, amused contempt at that.

Mai frowned at her. &quot;You stay out of this!&quot;

Natsuki turned her nose up at the redhead. &quot;I bet you failed all your 
qualifications, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; bit back Mai. &quot;I have my own reasons for what I do and I 
don&#39;t need to explain them to you.&quot;

Mikoto made a most adorably pathetic face and pointed at herself 
inquisitively. Mai found her resolve crumbling against such onslaught 
faster than she had expected. &quot;No, Mikoto, I won&#39;t tell her. But if you 
really want to know...&quot;

The young girl shook her head. &quot;Mmm... Mai is Mai and that&#39;s good 
enough.&quot;

Natsuki chuckled. That got her two dirty looks. Mai crossed her arms 
under her chest, because over would have been a little difficult given 
her stature, and assumed a &#39;disgruntled mother&#39; sort of atmosphere. &quot;And 
what are you laughing at?&quot;

&quot;You two are both as bad as each other.&quot;

&quot;Funny,&quot; replied Mai, a mischievous smirk about her face. &quot;I seem to 
recall saying the exact same thing about you two not so long ago.&quot;

Natsuki didn&#39;t respond, but her smile persisted.

&quot;So...just why am I getting a visit from the sexual deviance fairy early 
in the morning?&quot;

Natsuki glared at her and blushed at the same time, which gave quite the 
interesting overall effect. &quot;I came to check up on you.&quot;

&quot;Moi?&quot; Mai held a hand to her chest demurely, failing to cover even half 
of her bust, which was mainly the point.

&quot;Both of you,&quot; corrected the dark-haired girl, pointedly not staring at 
where Mai&#39;s pale pink pyjamas were left unbuttoned and folded open over 
her cleavage, and fuming mentally. &quot;I did say I&#39;d be dropping by to make 
sure Mikoto&#39;s okay, didn&#39;t I?&quot;

Mikoto started pouting, but Mai interrupted with a joyful little squeal. 
&quot;Hear that, Mikoto-chan? She was just so worried about you she had to 
come see you straight away.&quot;

Natsuki groaned and buried her face in one palm.

&quot;Natsuki-papa wants her morning tea, hm?&quot; Mai dashed off to the kitchen 
with a grin before anything else could be said to make more tea, leaving 
a very awkward silence in her wake. Mikoto and Natsuki stared at each 
other wide-eyed.

Mai set the pot down on the table and patted the chair beside her, 
struggling between a rampant snicker and a look of disappointment. &quot;Damn 
it, Kuga, you&#39;re no fun. Just come and sit down already.&quot;

Natsuki took her place at the table, reluctantly, and bowed her head 
when her own cup was presented. She sipped, slowly, and again had to 
suppress the urge to smile. Mai was a shockingly good cook.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; said the redhead, as if reading her mind, she smiled broadly. 
&quot;Takumi always said I was the chef of the family so I took a few classes 
in college.&quot; She looked over at the scrawny young ramen-snorting machine 
across the table and her expression turned a little fonder. &quot;It&#39;s nice 
to have people around to appreciate it, at the least.&quot;

Natsuki blushed ever so slightly. &quot;Well...thank you. And you&#39;re welcome. 
I&#39;d love to appreciate your cooking any time you need it.&quot;

Mai blushed back at her awkwardly for a moment. &quot;You&#39;re not the 
cold-hearted angry bitch you seem at first, are you Kuga-san?&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re certainly not the promiscuous lunatic I had you penned for, 
Tokiha-san,&quot; Natsuki shot back with a half-smirk.

&quot;Please, you can just call me Mai.&quot;

Natsuki narrowed her eyes slightly. &quot;Only if you never call me &quot;papa&quot; 
again.&quot;

&quot;Awww, but it&#39;s just so adorable!&quot;

Mikoto blinked confusedly and looked between the two as Natsuki rubbed 
her forehead and Mai giggled deviously.

&quot;I guess Midori-sensei taught you a sense of humour too...&quot;

For a second, Natsuki had the most overwhelming feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. She 
shook the sensation from her head.

&quot;How would you know, tall dark and mysterious?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been asking around,&quot; Natsuki lied smoothly. &quot;Harada-san told me 
you were kind of a prude when you first met.&quot;

&quot;Chie would say that. I remember her and Aoi-chan having &quot;cheesecake 
contests&quot; all summer long.&quot; Two identical looks of bewilderment met her 
eyes. &quot;See, they&#39;d both wear swimsuits and just sort of lounge about by 
the swimming pool in the gym, and when a guy came by they&#39;d both start 
making suggestive poses at him and judge who got the best reaction.&quot;

&quot;How...vulgar.&quot;

Mai grinned a sinister grin. &quot;They stopped when I started hitting on 
them both.&quot;

Natsuki turned red. Mai punched her firmly in the arm. &quot;Midori-chan gave 
me the confidence to say things like that for my own gain! She did not 
turn me into a lesbian!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s a lesbian?&quot;

Now Mai turned red, and Natsuki just buried her face in her hands again. 
&quot;That&#39;s...a complicated question.&quot;

Mikoto looked at her expectantly, curiously, like a cat faced with an 
unexplained new toy.

&quot;...&quot; Mai&#39;s mouth hung open dumbly.

&quot;There&#39;s an Orphan roaming around,&quot; mumbled Natsuki, effectively 
shattering the awkward silence like a dropped brick.

Mikoto bolted out of her seat at once, reaching for her sword where it 
rested against the wall behind her. Mai was on her feet seconds later, 
an excited expression written across her face. Her eyes lit up like fire 
and her body seemed at once more animated as she turned to where Natsuki 
still sat next to her.

&quot;Finally! I thought the damned thing would never show up!&quot;

&quot;Wait...&quot; Natsuki blinked up at her. &quot;You knew?&quot;

&quot;I knew there was an Orphan somewhere around this place, in this 
district. I&#39;ve been waiting for it to show itself.&quot;

Natsuki looked around for a moment at the apartment itself, a knowing 
expression crossing her features. &quot;So...that&#39;s why you live like this, 
hm? Why you only have a part-time job and live in a place with such low 
rent...&quot;

Mai rubbed a hand against the back of her head awkwardly. &quot;Midori-chan 
really hammered that stuff into my head. A Hime&#39;s job is to defend 
others, and to destroy the Orphans or anything else like that.&quot;

&quot;Midori-sensei really rubbed off on you, didn&#39;t she?&quot;

There was a moment of silence before Mai burst out laughing and Natsuki 
buried her face in her hands again, blushing furiously, in more ways 
than one. Mikoto looked baffled, shrugged, and went back to being a 
fifth wheel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a warm, sunny afternoon in Tokyo. The sky was somewhat overcast, 
but no rain threatened through the thick, fluffy white clouds gathered 
overhead. The bright summer sun beamed down through narrows gaps, 
inadvertently blinding one or two people who just happened to look up at 
the wrong moment. In one particular part of Tokyo, in a large park, in 
the middle of pretty much nowhere beside a long, winding paved pathway, 
was a long wooden bench. It was hedged in from behind by a thick line of 
young trees and bushes, which often shaded it from the torturous summer 
midday sun.

Sitting on the bench, one to either end, were two young men, or rather, 
two older schoolboys, neither one that far from adulthood by the looks 
of them. The one was a moderately tall and thin figure, short 
dirty-blonde hair and greenish eyes that were at that moment resting 
limply shut, his head dangling off the back of the bench. The other was 
the shorter of the two, but not by very much, and more muscular than his 
companion by a respectable margin. He sat hunched over a book that lay 
in his lap, chewing on the back end of a pencil, his thick, ragged-cut 
brown hair constantly shifting in the gentle breeze and irritating him 
no end.

All of a sudden, the brown-eyed, brown-haired, book-toting youth sat up 
straight.

&quot;Hey, Kazuki?&quot; he said, turning to the other boy.

&quot;Hm?&quot; replied his friend in a non-committal sort of grunt.

&quot;Do you, er...&quot; The first boy hesitated for a moment. &quot;Do you...smell 
something?&quot;

The blonde-haired boy raised his head and sniffed at the air. &quot;Hey, 
y&#39;know...&quot; He frowned and looked around quickly. &quot;Smells kinda like 
fish.&quot;

&quot;Fishy, eh?&quot;

&quot;Minoru!&quot; The blonde, Kazuki, gave his darker-haired companion a good 
solid punch on the arm. &quot;I&#39;m serious, here!&quot;

&quot;So am I! I mean...&quot; The brown-haired boy gestured in a wide circle with 
one arm. &quot;...do you see any fish vendors or anything like that around 
here?&quot;

Kazuki looked at him cautiously for a few moments before replying, &quot;What 
if they&#39;re hiding?&quot;

Minoru slapped his forehead. &quot;You&#39;re an idiot sometimes, Uwada-kun.&quot;

&quot;Besides, it smells more like a rat.&quot; Minoru gave his friend a confused 
look as Kazuki struck a pose, one foot up on the bench, hand rubbing his 
chin. &quot;Yes, definitely! A giant rat! A giant, mutant rat!&quot; Minoru 
chuckled cynically. &quot;I smell a magical girl show!&quot; proclaimed the 
blonde, pointing dramatically up into the sky and posing stylishly (he 
thought).

&quot;You really are-&quot;

Thump-thump.

Both boys froze.

There were now a most ornate pair of shoes, nay, boots even, balanced 
atop the back of the bench; a beautiful emerald-green they were, made of 
many interlocking plates, each one delicately edged with gold. They were 
thick-soled, thick all over in fact, and rather high up past their 
wearer&#39;s ankles. From the tops of those boots emerged a pair of slender, 
smooth-skinned feminine calves, toned to perfection. Atop them, about 
similarly flawless knee joints, were clasped a matching pair of green 
kneepads, borders etched out in gold just as with the boots. The most 
sumptuously sleek, muscular, milk-white thighs filled the gap from there 
up to a micro-length miniskirt so short it was simply indecent, in the 
same deep jade hue and gold highlights, only this time mostly fabric 
hanging from a narrow band of that armour-like plate. The top of the 
skirt dipped down between the wearer&#39;s broad, softly curved hips in a 
broad V-shape that pushed the suggestiveness of the outfit to its very 
limits. Gauntlet-clad hands, thick and padded, covered in the same 
narrow green-and-gold metallic plates as the rest, hung down beside 
those same hips. The rest of those magnificent arms were left bare right 
up to the shoulder, barring wrap-around pads on the elbows that matched 
the kneepads down below. The shoulders on that mysterious womanly figure 
were at once both slender and feminine, yet still powerfully muscular.

Above the obscenely short skirt, an abdominal region to match, firmly 
rounded musculature only hinted at vaguely beneath smooth, taught female 
skin. Above there even was a sort of vest-like apparatus in the same 
green-on-gold armour plates that only just obscured view of quite the 
prodigious bulging of bust. A deep, wide V-cut left far more cleavage 
than was strictly necessary open to the eye, from above and from below, 
just a thin pinpoint of fabric holding the two sides of the garment 
together in front. There was a wide space between her shoulders where 
the top left most of her collar area and her upper chest naked to the 
world, bordered on each side by bulbous, rounded shoulder-pads.

A narrow emerald-green fabric strip was tied about her delicate throat 
into a neat bow at the front, finished off with more of that 
painstakingly careful filigree work. Her head was held high, chin up, 
with a look of prideful wrath upon her feminine face. Violet eye shadow 
swept out in a narrow triangular swatch from the outside corner of each 
eye, making those soft purple eyes look somehow narrower, more focused 
and sinister, more dangerous. Full, warm red lips pouted together in a 
narrow kiss, both alluring and treacherous. Mustard-yellow hair flowed 
back from the crest of her forehead and down the back of her neck to her 
shoulder blades, billowing out into a thick, lazily billowing wave of 
luxurious softness wafting in the breeze.

The nameless young woman clenched one glove-encased hand into a fist and 
rested it on her hip, while bringing the other hand up and out in front 
of her, pointing one finger decisively towards what appeared to be a 
completely empty patch of grass on the other side of the path. She took 
a deep breath inward, which action inadvertently caused her breasts to 
swell up against the inside of her top until it strained to contain 
them...

...instead of the woman spouting off dramatic monologue, something 
completely unexpected happened. A bright yellow flash of colour ignited 
the end of the armour-clad woman&#39;s outstretched forefinger and a 
thigh-thick beam of that same pale yellow light leapt forth at 
tremendous speed, striking some invisible barrier right about where that 
finger was pointing towards and bursting in a wide splash of yellow 
flame. There was a deafening noise, somewhere between a screech and a 
roar. The air where that beam had struck shimmered like a mirage, and 
out of the rippling, a gigantic serpentine creature gradually faded into 
view.

It was almost ten metres from head to tail, though that huge snaking 
tail did take up a fair portion of that length, and its limbs were 
similarly slender and snake-like. Its head sat on the end of a long, 
sleek neck, a blunt wedge shape with a sharply pointed snout from whence 
protruded two long, curved fangs each the size of an entire forearm. Its 
eyes, its narrow snout, its limbs and tail and the strangely lavender 
fur that covered from end to end spoke of some kind of rodent origin.

It turned its head to the armoured woman and shriek-hissed terribly, jaw 
wide open to show off rows of serrated fangs dripping saliva and a long, 
thin, pointed tongue.

The woman ignored it. Instead, she leapt up into the air with a swoosh, 
the action cutting a rather deep gouge into the back of the bench with 
those heavy boots. Her finger came stabbing down towards the creature as 
she fell again, a second blazing yellow beam erupting from the tip of 
that finger and sending the strange rat-like monster sprawling as it 
slammed straight into its narrow chest area.

At once, the huge tail was lashing round in a wide arc up towards the 
descending figure, the long spikes on its tip ready to rend through 
flesh and probably anything else that got in the way. Instead of being 
brutally impaled, the woman turned, in midair, and actually sidestepped 
the oncoming tail, as if the empty air beneath her feet were a cohesive 
surface. As that tremendous limb whisked mere inches from her nose, she 
was already turning to bring her other hand to bear on the creature, 
firing off a whole volley of successive yellow bursts, from all five 
fingers, this time as thick globular segments. Each one struck with a 
satisfyingly loud double-bang, and wailing screams followed as smoke 
billowed from the creature&#39;s back and obscured most of its features.

Just when they thought the fight was all over, the two awe-stricken boys 
threw themselves back away from the huge monster, back behind the bench 
for cover as a flurry of razor-sharp white spines exploded upwards like 
a geyser. A jet of high-speed knives flew up towards the floating 
armoured woman, and even then, the injured creature on the ground was 
rolling to one side and looking skyward, watching for the effects of its 
unexpected attack. The mustard-haired woman seemed unconcerned...

Just as those flying blades were seconds from slicing her to pieces, 
several dozen tiny green-and-gold objects roughly conical in shape, no 
larger than a thumb each, appeared in a rough shell formation around 
her. They tracked on each and every incoming blade in less than the 
blink of an eye and, with a deafening series of rapid-fire cracks, 
wire-thin yellow beams lanced out and reduced the flying spikes to 
nothing more substantial than a small cloud of fine white dust.

Kazuki was impressed. Minoru boggled openly, wide-mouthed and wide-eyed. 
Neither said anything, or even moved from their makeshift hiding place.

The woman, thus protected from the deadly hail of spikes, flipped 
end-over-end so that she was facing headfirst down towards the beast 
below her and plummeted like a bullet, one arm stretched out in front of 
her, hand spread wide open and yellow sparks growing rapidly at the tip 
of each digit. When she collided with the monster, her hand exploded 
into a furious blinding yellow light-storm, accompanied by a thunderous 
triple-boom that shook the ground in the immediate vicinity like a minor 
earthquake.

When the smoke cleared, there was no sign of the creature but for a wide 
circular area where the grass had been blasted away and the earth 
beneath was scorched black, a softly glowing ring around it. The 
mysterious woman stood triumphantly in the very centre, arms crossed 
over her large chest. She looked to the two boys who had witnessed the 
event and, finally, spoke.

&quot;Armitage has defeated her enemy once again!&quot; she shouted 
inspirationally, her voice still as sweet and melodious as her 
appearance suggested, but also brazenly vigorous. &quot;The innocent citizens 
of this city are safe!&quot;

With that, she leapt into the air and disappeared.

&quot;Kazuki,&quot; ventured the dark-haired boy after quite a while. &quot;What the 
crap was that?&quot;

&quot;Er...&quot; replied the blonde, gesturing wildly with his hands. &quot;That 
was...she was...&quot; His hands subconsciously made a wide cupping gesture 
as he spoke. &quot;She...was...really hot.&quot;

&quot;Nobody&#39;s gonna believe this, you know.&quot;

For a short while, they stared at the softly steaming ground where the 
creature had been vanquished, and said nothing. Eventually, the blonde 
turned to his friend.

&quot;I gotta know...how did she stay in that top?&quot;

&quot;Kazuki, I&#39;m pretty sure most of what she did was scientifically 
impossible.&quot;

&quot;Yeah but...&quot; The blonde made more of those cupping motions with his 
hands. &quot;Priorities, man.&quot;

Minoru sighed, but smiled. &quot;You&#39;re intolerable.&quot;

&quot;On reflection, my second guess would have been far less confusing.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; said the blonde, but asked anyway, &quot;What was your second guess?&quot;

&quot;Giant mutant ninja tur-&quot;

&quot;-You really need a girlfriend, Kazuki.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There was a knock at the door. Shizuru glared at it for a moment or two.

&quot;Come in,&quot; she sighed, dunking a small packet full of photographs into 
the top drawer of her desk. The key turned with a satisfying click.

&quot;Ma&#39;am, I thought I should remind you that your schedule today is far 
too full to spend your lunch break staring at your ex-girlfriend.&quot;

Shizuru blinked. &quot;How did you...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s my job to know what my boss is doing, ma&#39;am.&quot; Motoko almost, 
almost smirked.

&quot;I should stay on my toes around you if that&#39;s the way it is.&quot; Shizuru 
shoved back her chair and stood slowly, brushing down her skirt with one 
hand. &quot;Next thing I know, you&#39;ll have cameras in the changing rooms and 
I&#39;ll be done for sexual harassment.&quot;

&quot;You should be done for sexual harassment anyway,&quot; muttered the younger 
woman under her breath. &quot;Besides, where would I get the cameras?&quot;

&quot;You could always borrow a few of mine,&quot; replied Shizuru all too 
cheerfully.

Motoko simply frowned at her disapprovingly, which somehow was far more 
pleasing a result than anything else Shizuru had ever gotten. The blonde 
secretary disappeared back through the door again, leaving it wide open 
in the process.

&quot;I would be hurrying, if I were you, ma&#39;am,&quot; she called back over her 
shoulder. &quot;Your appointment with the head of staff is in one hour.&quot;

The edge of Shizuru&#39;s mouth slowly turned up into a somewhat feline 
grin. &quot;What&#39;s with the occasion, anyway?&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Motoko turned as her superior came striding out of the office. The 
older woman stopped and gave her secretary a rather vague gesture.

&quot;You look so...fancy. Like you dressed up for something.&quot;

Motoko looked down at herself, at the exact same black-and-white suit 
combination she almost invariably wore to work. She looked back up at 
Shizuru with a dubious expression.

&quot;Your tie! And your hair, too! You look so...&quot; Shizuru blinked. &quot;And are 
those your good shoes?&quot;

The short woman sighed deeply. She was indeed dressed up, as far so as 
Motoko ever did. The blouse was the same nameless, brand-less white 
short-sleeved blouse as every other she wore, but around her collar was 
a neat black tie to match the rest of the suit that disappeared down 
under her buttoned jacket, with a narrow diamond motif etched in thin 
gold lines on the front. Her shoes were usually the obligatory black 
flat-soles, but for this one particular occasion, she wore what were 
definitely high-heels in the same jet black, with thin straps and narrow 
toes, and a small diamond-based pattern on the front of each that 
matched her tie. Her thick blonde hair was pinned back on the wrong 
side, which created a strange asymmetrical illusion to her face, and the 
bun in the back was missing for once, which left all of that golden mess 
to fall down over her shoulders in a single uniform wave.

She failed to blush when Shizuru leaned in closer. Instead, she coughed 
into her hand. &quot;You should really get going, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Just as soon as you tell me why you&#39;re looking so fresh today.&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t concern you, ma&#39;am. Now if you&#39;ll excuse me...&quot; With that, 
she sidled past the taller woman and into the vacated office, shutting 
the door behind her.

&quot;I&#39;ll be back, Moko-chan! Just you don&#39;t get any finger marks on those 
photos!&quot;

Sufficiently amused at her assistant&#39;s personal expense, as always, 
Shizuru set off with a pleasant smile down the corridor towards whatever 
awaited her. As per non-the-usual, however, she didn&#39;t get very far 
before the rather abnormal recent events caught up to her once again.

&quot;You&#39;ve got mail!&quot; chirped the device in her bag in that obnoxiously 
jovial mechanical voice. She fished it out with a groan and checked the 
display...

Natsuki&#39;s name flashed up. How intriguing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The small restaurant Cat&#39;s Paws was something a little different in the 
middle of a densely packed district of Tokyo. It sat between a hardware 
store to the left, with huge displays, blaring pictures and gaudy 
advertising, and a drab, square, grey-fronted building to the right that 
only few actually knew was a video store, sans any kind of fa&ccedil;ade. It 
was a rather small building itself, practically built into the buildings 
around it, only two storeys and barely enough space across the front for 
five whole panel windows. There was a sign that stood out front on the 
pavement that yelled out various &quot;special offers&quot; to passers-by, and a 
wide overhanging orange shade above the front wall with &quot;Cat&#39;s Paws&quot; in 
bright yellow.

Inside was just as bright and, some might say, just as lurid. The 
restaurant walls were a bright golden-yellow shade, the ceiling plain 
white, and the floor was of polished wood. There was a narrow bar in the 
far corner of the room, no stools, where drinks of all kinds were 
apparently on sale. The intervening space, from wall to wall all the way 
from the door to a small gap at the back wall in front of the kitchen 
doors, was a semi-disorganised collection of identical circular tables. 
Only along the front wall, sidled right up next to the full-length panel 
windows was an entire row of booths, wooden walls on either side with 
block seats and square, wooden tables. To fit the design better, the 
paving on the outside had been dug up in a narrow strip and a wide 
assortment of plants provided a half-decent cover from about chest 
height down.

The interior wasn&#39;t the only scenery, though. In typical commercial 
style, the restaurant had a full compliment of attractive young 
waitresses, all dressed in identical uniforms; narrow, strapless orange 
shoes, lace-trimmed ankle-socks, orange and white striped miniskirt, 
short-sleeved white button-up blouse, loud orange sleeveless jacket, and 
a rectangular nametag in both English and Japanese pinned on the left 
breast. Nobody knew for certain what colour the &#39;other&#39; bits of the 
uniform really were, but there were plenty of rumours.

Mai brushed the back of her skirt down again as it rode dangerously high 
while she bent over to pick up a coffee jar from one table. The young 
boy, far too young in Mai&#39;s opinion, in the seat behind her made a 
disappointed face and turned back to his brother/friend. Mai tried her 
best to ignore it.

Her feet hurt. The shoes pinched terribly after several hours on the job 
and the three-inch-high heels knocked her centre of balance too far 
forward, which meant that when she had to bend over for anything she had 
to stick out her rear end in a most provocative manner. Well, at least 
it kept the skirt from riding too high...most of the time.

Suddenly, the door chimed to signal the advent of yet another new 
customer, and Mai turned to greet him or her, or them, in her best 
cheerful waitress voice.

&quot;Good afternoon! How can...&quot; She trailed off.

For a moment or two, Mai was actually dumbstruck by the sight before 
her. By the look of it, so were several of the other customers. Many 
pairs of eyes all fell upon the figure in the open doorway.

She was young, and vibrant, and she was utterly beautiful, and no one 
present could find the words to deny it however hard they tried. Her 
slender, dainty feet were trapped within narrow, pointed black 
high-heeled shoes and soft pink ankle-high socks. Her legs were the 
purest, milky white, smooth and almost unbelievably long, stretching on 
and on up to her skirt, generously muscular thighs disappearing under 
the not quite knee-length pleated brown garment. Above that, a plain 
white short-sleeved blouse covered her upper half, soft half-frills 
around each cuff and about her collar. The buttons down the front seemed 
to strain slightly as she took a deep breath in, her prodigious bust 
almost matching Mai&#39;s own for sheer mass. She was tall, or modestly so 
at least, and she was athletically built, her body smoothly muscled 
through gentle curves. Her bare arms looked just as firm and strong as 
the rest of her.

Her face was slightly rounded, somewhere between triangular and ovoid in 
just the right way, with a dainty pointed nose and soft, narrow red lips 
that pouted out as she looked around her. Her eyes were wide and bright, 
a deep lavender colour much like Mai&#39;s own, but thin accents in violet 
eye shadow made them look narrower and more sultry somehow. Her hair 
flowed like a thick velvet curtain down behind her to her shoulders, 
though it was a most peculiar mustard-yellow velvet.

Hovering immediately behind her was a second young woman, thought she 
looked far more mature than the first. Dark, attentive eyes looked 
almost greyish-black behind a pair of narrow silver-framed glasses. The 
mass of brownish red hair atop her head was short and thick, and reached 
only barely halfway down the back of her neck. It was mostly somewhat 
disorganised, as if she had simply shook her head and sprayed it in 
place, but she pulled it off stunningly. The rest of her slender, 
modestly-equipped body was tucked into a neat, dark brown business suit, 
conservatively cut in contrast to her far more revealing companion.

For a half a second, Mai felt a creeping sensation of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.

&quot;Haruka-chan!&quot; whined the brunette. Her face showed an anxious concern 
as she looked about the establishment.

The mustard-haired woman&#39;s own features were a deviously self-amused 
sort of expression one might expect from a happily scheming young girl. 
&quot;Nonsense, Yukino!&quot; she said, nowhere near quietly, waving one hand in a 
dismissive manner. &quot;We have plenty of time for lunch. And besides, I&#39;m 
hungry!&quot;

&quot;Haruka-chan, really. You have a meeting with-&quot;

&quot;-Oh, Yukino, just for this once can&#39;t you trust me? I promised I&#39;d be 
there and I will.&quot;

The brunette sighed as she watched her partner walking, or more to the 
point, sauntering over towards the nearest waitress, which happened to 
be a certain orange-haired young twenty-something.

&quot;I just can&#39;t change Haruka-chan even if I tried,&quot; she conceded with the 
hint of a fond half-smile tugging at the corner of her mouth.

&quot;Good afternoon,&quot; said Mai firmly, bowing to the mustard-haired woman 
respectfully. &quot;How can-&quot;

&quot;-We&#39;ll take a table for two, thank you,&quot; the woman demanded 
presumptuously. Her companion appeared millimetres behind her and peered 
over her shoulder at Mai.

&quot;Just a quiet seat in the corner will do, if that&#39;s at all possible.&quot;

&quot;No problem at all, miss!&quot; replied the redhead cheerfully, smiling hard 
in spite of the faintly bizarre situation. She turned and gestured with 
one hand toward a booth tucked into the far corner along the front wall 
of the restaurant, empty but for the obligatory stack of condiments and 
napkins. &quot;You can sit here, if you like...&quot;

The brunette woman bowed, a tad nervously. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she insisted, 
and then she said it a second time just for good measure. Mai laughed 
uncomfortably and waved her hand.

&quot;You&#39;re very welcome, miss, really. If there&#39;s anything else you need, 
just say so.&quot;

&quot;Haruka-chan, wait!&quot; Haruka, of course, was already striding across to 
her table with a purposeful look upon her face, her heels clicking on 
the polished floor. As she moved, everyone turned to follow her. She 
ignored them with an air most professional, as that of someone used to 
having whole swarms of eyes watching her every move. Yukino was seconds 
behind her, hurrying along in a much more dainty and demure manner 
lugging the thick black shoulder-bag up to her side.

Mai gave a slow shrug and then turned back to work.

Haruka threw herself, literally, into her seat, in a most un-ladylike 
fashion, not that she seemed to care in the least. She leaned back 
slightly into the seat and watched with narrowed eyes as her brunette 
companion seated herself, much more lightly it had to be said.

Yukino hefted the thick black shoulder-bag up onto the table and tore 
open the Velcro flap across the top. Out slid a smooth, sleek silver 
laptop not more than a foot across each side and almost impossibly thin. 
It folded out with a click and a soft whirr and the screen lit up with 
that familiar background, which immediately made Yukino blush and direct 
the thing away from the surrounding patrons.

Haruka yawned. Yukino ignored her and started typing away as usual.

Haruka leaned up over the table and rested her perfectly smooth chin in 
one palm, her forefinger twining a few strands of hair into a loose 
coil. Yukino still ignored her.

Haruka sat back, sighed...and then very slowly, crossed one leg over the 
other. The hem of her already indecently short skirt pushed up that inch 
or two higher.

Yukino coughed as her face turned bright red. Her eyes fixed intently to 
the screen before her as if her life depended on it.

Haruka grinned deviously. &quot;So, my faithful assistant,&quot; she spoke again 
in that not-very-quiet voice of hers. &quot;What would you like to eat, while 
we&#39;re here?&quot;

Yukino shook her head ever so slightly. &quot;I&#39;ll be okay, Haruka-chan.&quot;

The mustard-haired beauty shook a finger at her companion and drew up a 
most displeased face. &quot;That won&#39;t do, Yukino. You need to eat and stay 
well and be healthy!&quot; She leaned forward, until she knew the other woman 
could see down the narrow gap where the top two buttons of her blouse 
were left unfastened. Her features shifted from deviously sinister to 
sinister and sultry, mostly sultry. &quot;After all,&quot; she continued in a 
decidedly sensuous tone of voice that set Yukino fidgeting at once, 
&quot;what would I do without me dear Yukino to take care of me, hm?&quot;

&quot;Haruka-chan...&quot; whined the brunette. She gasped, for reasons 
undisclosed, and blushed a whole new shade of red. Haruka&#39;s grin grew 
ever wider.

&quot;You&#39;re frustrated,&quot; she eventually managed to say. &quot;Something didn&#39;t go 
the way you...planned.&quot; The pause was punctuated nicely with a 
barely-audible squeak from the brunette woman and another violent blush.

Haruka pouted, angrily, which looked just fantastic on her, as did most 
of her moods. &quot;It got away, damn it,&quot; she cursed in an 
uncharacteristically subdued voice. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I lost to such a 
simple opponent.&quot;

Yukino gave her an affectionate look. &quot;You didn&#39;t lose, Haruka-chan. It 
got away. There&#39;s a huge difference there.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah?&quot;

&quot;It ran away from you. Look at it that way, hm?&quot;

Haruka blinked. &quot;When you say it like that, I do feel much better about 
it.&quot; She grinned triumphantly and made a fist with one hand. &quot;That 
cowardly beast ran away from the great Ar-&quot;

&quot;-Haruka-chan, NOT here!&quot; Yukino waved her hands in a flurry. &quot;You know 
you should be more careful about that in public.&quot;

Haruka uncrossed, and then re-crossed those endlessly long legs, just as 
slowly as before. &quot;You&#39;re so cautious, Yukino.&quot; She smiled. &quot;But then, I 
suppose it balances out, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;

Yukino looked up, a tad puzzled all of a sudden. Her expression shifted 
to something much more contemplative when she noticed Haruka gazing 
fondly at the narrow golden ring about her middle finger, fidgeting it 
about restlessly.

&quot;I thought we agreed you don&#39;t have to wear that all the time if you 
don&#39;t want to...&quot;

Haruka gave her a very forceful look. &quot;I want to.&quot;

&quot;People will only get the wrong impression.&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;ll have to hurry up and find another ring, won&#39;t I?&quot;

Yukino blushed darkly and stuffed her nose down against the computer 
screen. She couldn&#39;t hope to keep the smile from her face though.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That little black cat was back again. It was sitting on the railing on 
the balcony just outside her front door, waiting for her. As she climbed 
the stairs up to her apartment, the cat peered intently down at her from 
its makeshift lookout post, as if assessing her on sight. She glared 
right back at it.

&quot;And what do you think you&#39;re doing here?&quot; she demanded of it.

&quot;Meow,&quot; said the cat in a contemptuous tone and promptly ignored her. It 
curled round in a crescent shape atop the black railing and went to 
sleep, or whatever it was that cats did that was somewhere between awake 
and asleep.

Mai frowned at it and turned to her apartment door instead

&quot;I&#39;m home, Mikoto!&quot;

Mai froze, stunned momentarily. Before her was not the drab interior of 
the small one-bedroom apartment she had so dutifully searched to find, 
but a room all too familiar. It was long and narrow, with warm yellow 
walls all around and polished wood furnishings, what little there were. 
To her immediate left was a door that she also recognised, and past 
that, a rather diminutive kitchen area, with table and chairs to the 
right along the opposite wall. Further along, two beds sat side-by-side 
against the left wall, half hidden behind the kitchen wall. The 
remainder of the room space was empty, bar for only one thing.

At the far end of the room, in front of the single wide panel window, 
stood a silhouetted figure of roughly average height, thought apparently 
quite young, and a slender build. She, for it was most definitely 
female, blocked out a thick patch of the warm orange sunlight streaming 
in through the gaps between the horizontal grey blinds across the 
window, outlining her in a deep shadow.

As Mai stepped forward into the room, her eyes adjusted. She could make 
out grey and black and crimson on that silhouette, a flowing mass of 
deep purple-black hair. The figure turned to her and smiled, 
affectionately.

&quot;Mai!&quot;

Mai blinked. &quot;Huh?&quot;

Mikoto stared up at her longingly. &quot;You&#39;re home. I&#39;m hungry...&quot;

The redhead chuckled weakly and shook her head. &quot;You&#39;re just helpless 
without me, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Nuh!&quot; argued Mikoto. &quot;Mai&#39;s cooking is the best!&quot; She grabbed the 
taller girl by her wrist and practically dragged Mai inside, fidgeting 
excitedly as she went.

&quot;Alright! I&#39;ll cook you dinner right away,&quot; Mai relented at last, 
shrugging out of her thin red jacket and hanging it up neatly by the 
front door. Mikoto pranced about happily, sending her gathered feline 
friends dashing for cover under the breakfast table.

&quot;What will Mai cook today?&quot; she asked with a wondrous expression, eyes 
wide, peering up at the taller girl. Or more specifically, at the 
spatula Mai now held in her hand.

&quot;I&#39;m bored. And I bet you&#39;ve never eaten anything fancier than ramen, so 
I thought I&#39;d experiment!&quot; Mikoto looked a bit puzzled as Mai raided 
through the refrigerator and laid out a strange selection of vegetables 
on the counter. &quot;You should go sit down and wait, and keep your friends 
occupied. Wouldn&#39;t want anyone getting curious and ending up with burnt 
fur.&quot;

The young girl shook her head emphatically and made some sort of 
affirmative noise. With that, she turned and dove under the table, 
plucking felines one by one out from their precious hiding place and 
placing them in a line across the table-top in order of height. The 
little black one was missing, again, but that really wasn&#39;t all too 
surprising. He did tend to sunbathe on the balcony quite often.

&quot;Now then,&quot; said Mikoto, pointing her finger at the first cat and slowly 
moving along the ranks. &quot;Mai says you have to stay out of the kitchen, 
because it&#39;s not safe in there.&quot;

&quot;Meow,&quot; said one cat. The rest agreed.

Mikoto crossed her arms and pouted, much like Mai, though she would 
never admit it so readily. &quot;Either you all behave, or you can&#39;t come 
here any more.&quot;

The horde conferred among themselves for a moment or two before 
eventually settling the issue. One at a time, they each clambered down 
off the table and wandered off to find their own separate lounging spots 
around the apartment, noticeably away from the kitchen area. Only the 
skinny grey tabby stayed, slinking down into a half-curl on one of the 
unused chairs.

Mikoto nodded triumphantly. &quot;Good.&quot;

&quot;Mikoto-chan, what are you doing over there?&quot;

&quot;Just sorting everyone out! We&#39;re all done now so there&#39;s no problem.&quot;

Mai had already fired up the gas stove and was chopping vegetables, a 
pot full of rice bubbling softly beside her. &quot;That&#39;s...wonderful,&quot; she 
replied, quite deeply confused. Kami help if she ever started actually 
understanding that strange, eccentric wild girl.

Mikoto sniffed deeply. The effect was immediate, as her face lit up like 
a floodlight and her features melted into anticipatory ecstasy. &quot;Smells 
so gooooood,&quot; she half-moaned. &quot;Mai&#39;s cooking smells so wonderful.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re just easy to please,&quot; chuckled the redhead, waving at her with 
the end of the knife. &quot;I bet you&#39;re used to living on bento and ramen.&quot;

Mikoto didn&#39;t answer. She was too busy looking around curiously and 
sniffing. Mai cocked her head.

&quot;Er...what are you doing?&quot;

&quot;Do you smell that?&quot;

Mai sniffed. &quot;What, the garlic? If you don&#39;t like garlic, I can just...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; interrupted the young girl. &quot;I smell something...&quot; Her head span 
towards the window so fast Mai thought her neck might crack. &quot;Orphan!&quot;

&quot;Oh crap,&quot; said Mai&#39;s subconscious. She dropped the chopping knife 
anyway and had the foresight to turn the rice right down before she 
dashed round the counter to get a better view out of her apartment 
window. &quot;Where?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know...but it&#39;s close. I can smell it even better now.&quot;

Mai cursed, repeatedly. &quot;Has to be right when I&#39;m making dinner, doesn&#39;t 
it? The bastard. I bet he timed it this way.&quot;

Mikoto tugged the loose trousers that Mai had bought down off her skinny 
waist and dashed back into the bedroom, forgoing sliding the door shut 
behind her in her haste. Mai peeked in, not that she was peeking 
exactly, and was a little puzzled to see the young Hime wriggling her 
way into the expansive green sweater that was far too large for her.

&quot;What&#39;s that for?&quot;

Mikoto turned and dashed back out straight past her, towards the rack by 
the apartment door where all their combined armada of about five pairs 
of shoes were stored, along with various other bizarre odds and ends. &quot;I 
always wear this when I fight,&quot; replied the half-naked girl as she 
plucked her sword from its resting place and swung it up dangerously 
high over her head, to rest behind her back where she could hold it in 
place with just the one hand.

Mai blinked. &quot;Fight?&quot; She shook her head slowly. &quot;You mean you&#39;re coming 
with me?&quot;

Mikoto looked at her as if she had just said the stupidest thing ever. 
&quot;There&#39;s an Orphan out there. I have to get rid of it.&quot;

&quot;Is there any way I can talk you out of it? It&#39;s kinda dangerous, you 
know...&quot;

Mikoto shook her head petulantly.

&quot;Fine,&quot; Mai sighed. &quot;I&#39;m coming with you. We can find this thing and 
then we&#39;ll kill it. And hopefully, get back before the rice catches 
fire.&quot;

Mikoto was already peeling back the blinds and sliding the window open. 
She leapt out without a second thought and Mai felt the most unnerving 
sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach. A loud girlish yelp from 
outside quelled that.

&quot;Come on, Mai!&quot; yelled the dark-haired girl. &quot;Hurry up! It&#39;s getting 
away!&quot;

Mai wriggled her fingers impatiently as the thick, multi-coloured beads 
materialised about her ankles and wrists in wide orbiting ring 
configurations. At once, that strange feeling of energy flashed through 
her, and she had to suppress a slight shiver. &quot;Well, like Midori-chan 
said... it&#39;ll always catch up to me in the end.&quot;

She looked out of the window, at the rapidly darkening sky and the 
almost deserted street below, and grinned. &quot;Then I better be ready for 
it, hadn&#39;t I?&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On a moderately busy street in Tokyo&#39;s 12th District, there sat an 
electronics hardware store, of modest size and sandwiched between two 
other similarly sized establishments, a fast-food restaurant on one side 
and a bookshop on the other. Its entire front was taken up by huge panel 
windows that extended the full length from the pavement right up to the 
ledge that signalled where the ground level ceiling would be, and all 
the way out to either side edge. Filling most of the grand window-space 
were rows upon rows of television sets in all sizes and styles and 
colours, from widescreens to flat monitors thinner than a book, to 
strange designs in all sorts of abstract images. On every screen, at 
that very moment, was a deep blue background behind a curving 
hardwood-topped desk, behind which sat a rather fetching young blonde 
woman holding a thick stack of papers in a traditional reading position 
as she looked cheerfully into the camera and spoke with such speed and 
coherence that only newscasters seem capable of simultaneously. A small 
logo in the bottom left corner signified that this was a Tokyo News 
Network Live broadcast.

At that time in particular, the small digital display in the bottom 
corner of the picture was reading 20:04 and the ticker just above was 
scrolling past summarised events from the headlines, a second just above 
repeating the same words in English. A small crowd of people lingered in 
front of the shop, some of them just pausing and looking at the hardware 
on display, a few actually watching the news with intent before passing 
on, ever more new passers-by to take their place so that the crowd never 
seemed to really grow or shrink.

&quot;In other news today,&quot; announced the slowly scrolling bilingual yellow 
subtitles that crawled lazily from the top left corner down to the 
bottom while the announcer spoke, her voice muted through the glass, 
&quot;the J.S.D.F. have just received a large shipment of foreign weaponry. 
The first of these brand-new missile protection systems is scheduled to 
be installed in the J.S.D.F. base just outside Tokyo Central within the 
next few months.&quot; The screen shifted to show the usual seemingly random 
images of Japanese Self-Defence troops doing various mundane tasks, an 
airbase, tanks, and so on. &quot;The Japanese Defence Cabinet issued the 
contract for new ground-based anti-missile systems early in 2003 after 
local companies presented many concepts for guidance and targeting 
computers to the J.S.D.F., but then proved unable to supply appropriate 
weaponry. In a last-minute bid against American contractor Lockheed 
Martin that has become almost synonymous with the company&#39;s business 
image, the UK-based arms manufacturing firm...&quot;

&quot;Can you believe that?&quot; said a rather tall middle-aged-looking man 
standing in front of the window, watching with a cynical look on his 
face. He nudged the person next to him with an elbow. &quot;We sign up all 
that paperwork to get rid of the army and now our government goes and 
builds a new one without us.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a state military,&quot; replied the smartly dressed young businessman 
next to him, trying to look apologetic. &quot;It exists to protect the 
public. Not much use if all our hardware is obsolete. Besides...&quot; He 
nodded back at the screen again. &quot;...It&#39;s just anti-missile junk 
mainly.&quot;

The older man looked down at him sceptically. &quot;Seems to me like you know 
a lot about this stuff, eh?&quot;

&quot;I pay attention to the financial world. Most wouldn&#39;t know, but B.A.E. 
has had more and more financial influence in the Japanese market over 
the past few decades, ever since that trade agreement.&quot;

His elder gave him a rueful half-grin. &quot;I&#39;d be worried about foreigners 
invading, but I know from my own son that they&#39;ve put money into 
Hokkaido for years.&quot;

&quot;Your son works for them?&quot; The younger man then held up a hand and bowed 
his head apologetically. &quot;Excuse me, it&#39;s not my place to intrude on 
your familial affairs.&quot;

The older man snorted. &quot;You&#39;re too damned polite, too. I was thinking 
you&#39;d be one of those punk teenagers, but you&#39;re more like my father.&quot;

They each laughed, and then went their separate ways, leaving the crowd 
to fill back in against the window.

&quot;...Samsung Motors have denied involvement in the incident,&quot; continued 
the newscaster on another topic entirely, &quot;claiming that their only 
reason for contributing to the recovery team efforts was to inspect the 
vehicle itself for faults.&quot; A picture of one of Tokyo&#39;s many parks 
filled the screen, centred about a large maintenance vehicle that lay on 
its side, gutted and steaming on the grass next to a wide paved pathway. 
The ground beneath it was burnt in a strangely uniform circular 
formation. &quot;This follows similar appearances of Samsung teams at the 
site of other accidents involving municipal vehicles, that Samsung 
Motors claim are part of their new corporate objective; to assess 
vehicle design flaws which have proven to cause serious problems and 
thereby wipe them out from their own products. Thankfully, no one was 
actually hurt in the incident, though police have made a statement to 
Tokyo News concerning two young adult males who were found nearby the 
site of the accident, apparently delirious. The two men are apparently 
being held overnight for questioning...&quot;

&quot;Mikoto, slow down already!&quot;

The crowd scattered away from the window in disarray as something short 
and green dashed straight through the lot of them, dragging some 
enormous black lump behind it. It darted down the street a short way 
along an ugly grey metal railing that lined the front of some old 
abandoned industrial building, then turned and bolted through a gap 
where one of the bars had come loose, disappearing from sight.

Right behind it was a second, much larger something, fairly tall and 
orange-haired, dressed in dark brown slacks and a light grey t-shirt, 
yelling after the first blur whilst also attempting to apologize to 
everyone for barging through the crowd. She reached the fence, sighed 
heavily and then squeezed herself through the gap too.

Mikoto leapt up and over the six-foot high wall surrounding the run-down 
old factory building as if it wasn&#39;t even there, flying through the air 
in a wide arc that sent her sword streaming out behind her, barely 
clipping the top edge of the concrete wall and throwing up a gasp of 
orange sparks. She dove into a half-roll on the other side and continued 
in the same direction, bare feet slapping against the cold paved ground 
and the edge of her sword bouncing against the pavement, setting off a 
thin trail of sparks behind as she ran. The thick pale-green sweater 
draped over her body flapped out behind her as she ran, thankfully never 
rising higher than about mid-thigh.

&quot;Mikoto!&quot; yelled Mai, again. The dark-haired young girl seemed 
completely unprepared to listen to reason, however, and was only getting 
further and further ahead as they sped towards their unseen common 
enemy. Mai felt the nagging temptation to summon up her Element and just 
fly the rest of the way, but Midori-sensei&#39;s voice crept into the back 
of her head, &quot;A Hime can&#39;t be a Hime if she&#39;s locked in prison, or being 
dissected!&quot;

&quot;Stupid Orphan,&quot; Mai hissed, and then she cursed the creature quite 
loudly and inventively, mostly just for existing in the first place.

&quot;Mai, hurry up!&quot; yelled back an excited young voice from far ahead of 
her as she rounded a corner and plunged headlong down a dark, narrow 
alleyway sandwiched between the brick-like multi-storey main building 
standing in the centre of the complex, and a small metal shed with 
several rather large and brightly painted warning signs on the door. 
Mikoto was nowhere to be found.

&quot;Up here!&quot;

Mai looked up, and was slightly taken aback by the sight of Mikoto&#39;s 
lower half as she wriggled her way in through a narrow window some ten 
feet up the side of the building. &quot;What the...how&#39;d you get up there? 
And what do you think you&#39;re doing! This is private property! We can&#39;t 
be here...&quot;

&quot;Hurry up, Mai!&quot; the young girl shouted back down at her. &quot;It&#39;ll get 
away!&quot; With that, her feet disappeared through the window.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The beast roared deafeningly, as if that was supposed to be scary or 
something. Mikoto hurled herself headfirst towards the noisy brute and 
hefted her blade round in a wide, rolling arc that took one thick blue 
arm apart at the elbow, accompanied by a screaming bellow of pain and a 
thick gout of green blood.

That huge whip-like appendage on its head lashed out at her and cleaved 
through a concrete pillar not seconds behind her, reminding the young 
girl why she had been avoiding direct assault up until that point. She 
promptly dove down its front, right past its blind spot, and ducked 
beneath the underside of that huge floating wormlike body, dashing for 
cover on the other side. Three enormous curved blades sank into the 
concrete floor behind her, so close she felt the wind on the soles of 
her feet.

Before it could turn to follow her, a fireball the size of a small car 
slammed into it broadside and burst open like a water balloon, splashing 
out flames all over the creature&#39;s side. They died quickly, but they 
left smouldering black marks on its skin all across its left side.

&quot;Mikoto, get back!&quot;

Another fireball leapt out of the darkness and engulfed both left arms, 
forcing the creature to flail about wildly in an attempt to put out the 
fire spreading across its flesh, bellowing angrily as it did so. All 
seven huge green eyes rolled around its head like liquid, gathering in a 
cluster towards the source of the flame.

Mai fixed it with the nastiest look she could muster, which was pretty 
awful given her years of practice, and held her hands out towards it. 
&quot;Stupid thing,&quot; she yelled at it angrily, &quot;interrupting my cooking! I 
spent all morning buying those ingredients and now they&#39;ll go to waste! 
You&#39;ll pay for this, damn it.&quot;

The creature screamed at her and tried to blot her out of existence with 
one of its remaining arms. The attempt failed dismally when that huge 
scythe-like blade glanced off an invisible curved barrier with a 
deafening metallic clang.

&quot;Mai! The eyes!&quot;

A flaming orange stream lanced out from the redhead&#39;s hands and struck 
the creature dead centre in the middle of that ugly dome-shaped head, 
puncturing straight through one huge eye. The eye gaped wide like an 
open mouth, showing thick rows of fangs and a writhing mass of fleshy 
tendrils. Unhesitating, Mai struck again, sending a white-hot wad of 
fire straight down that open maw like a ball through a hoop.

The creature stuttered in its non-existent tracks, tail thrashing madly 
inches above the floor, clawing at the ground with all three remaining 
arms. Its other &quot;eyes&quot; burst open in turn, belching out steam. While it 
writhed in agony, Mikoto launched herself at the thing from behind and 
brought her sword up in front of her, thrusting with her entire body 
weight. The tip of the blade glowed darkly as it swept through the air.

The blade sank through the monster&#39;s mid-section as if it were butter. 
The agonised wailing and roaring ceased abruptly and the creature&#39;s body 
slowly evaporated into nothing.

Mai growled. &quot;They&#39;re getting worse,&quot; she said half to herself as Mikoto 
hopped back down to the floor and hefted her blade to rest over one 
shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s like they&#39;re more and more intent on killing me each one 
I meet.&quot;

&quot;They don&#39;t stand a chance,&quot; said Mikoto triumphantly, grinning up at 
the taller woman. Mai smiled back down at her. &quot;Between the two of us, 
we&#39;re more than strong enough.&quot;

&quot;I hope you&#39;re right, or else there&#39;ll be problems. For starters, 
what&#39;ll happen if you get hurt and can&#39;t attend school next week?&quot;

Mikoto stabbed her sword into the floor and pouted. &quot;No way! I&#39;m not 
going to some stupid school! I spent all this time getting away from 
one...&quot;

Mai chuckled and rubbed her hand playfully through the young girl&#39;s 
hair. &quot;I&#39;d better find you a job, too! I bet you could pass off as 
sixteen, so we could get you working part-time like me.&quot;

She slid an arm around the girl&#39;s shoulders and half-dragged her back 
out of the room, leaving the darkness and a faint smell of ash behind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outside, the fence was still quite the obstacle, especially for Mai who 
happened to be not quite as lean as her young companion. By the time she 
got through the gap, her jacket was more than a little torn across the 
chest.

As the pair straightened themselves up and Mai made sure that no one had 
seen them sneaking out of the place so suspiciously, they both failed to 
notice a darkened car standing across the street, lights off, silent and 
seemingly unoccupied. The figure therein, obscured from view by only the 
darkness and the thick black coat about him, or her, reached into one 
pocket and drew out a small cylindrical object about the size of a 
normal pen. A thumb pressed one small button on the side of the device 
and then the figure held it up at face level.

&quot;Reporting op nine,&quot; said a very low, soft voice in a mild German 
accent. &quot;Unit alpha, unit beta, initial combat test status...&quot;

The figure grinned ominously. &quot;...all is going as predicted.&quot;
