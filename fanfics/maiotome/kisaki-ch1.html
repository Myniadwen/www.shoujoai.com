<h2>a <a href="../maiotome/index.html">Mai Otome</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/asinistre.html">Ange Sinistre</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;She left Fumi&#39;s side and began to climb to the top of the great hill 
that overlooked the oceans below. There, away from her comrades, young 
Victoria let her eyes wander to the stars. Overcome with her youth and 
her longing, she began to sing an old melody from Earth that had been 
contained within her mother&#39;s charm, the solitary personal possession 
she had owned before the migration. To Victoria, the song was more than 
a melody. It was a prayer streaking to the skies above, hoping that 
somehow, the relatives she had left behind would hear it.&quot; -- The 
Maiden&#39;s Lament, pg. 38. Written 2976, AD.

County Grauwald, Windbloom Kingdom

The gentle rays of the afternoon sun trickled through the dense forest 
around them, causing the lake nearby to look like it was filled of 
golden water. It was overcast, and the air carried a noted mist, though 
she was certain that it would not rain. It was her homeland. She knew 
the region&#39;s behavior perfectly, despite having lived abroad since her 
early teenage years. It was wonderful to see her home again, and felt 
herself in the embraces of nostalgia. It was a long overdue holiday 
after the hectic times they had recently faced.

It truly was beautiful. She had nearly forgotten. Many of the other 
noblemen of Windbloom envied Count Kruger because of his dominion over 
the Grey Forest. It was getting late, however. It would be wise to head 
back to the keep for the rest of the evening, even if it was 
uncomfortable to have the other members of her father&#39;s inner circle 
make sore remarks about young Mistress Kruger returning home with that 
&#39;concubine&#39; of hers, as the other woman had been so lovingly labeled.

She smiled as she gently caressed the cheek and jaw of her companion&#39;s 
face. So seldom did they have any free time together. They were lying 
next to a lake made golden by the rays of the sun, and had remained 
there for quite a while, simply enjoying each other&#39;s presence. Natsuki 
gently lay on top of Shizuru, her navy blue cloak shielding them both 
from the gradually cooling air around them.

&quot;We should get back to the keep. It&#39;s getting dark,&quot; Natsuki said at 
last.

The playful red eyes and the gentle smirk that followed that comment was 
a clear indication that Shizuru Viola was about to make some smart 
little comment that would no doubt want to make Natsuki throw her into 
the lake. &quot;Ara? Certainly the big tough headmistress of Garderobe is not 
afraid of the dark.&quot;

Natsuki&#39;s eyes darted to the shore and then back to Shizuru. Probably 
too great a distance to cover while trying to carry a kicking and 
protesting woman larger than herself. &quot;No. Neither are the wolves. So 
let&#39;s go, onee-sama.&quot;

That last part was laced with a snide attitude. Natsuki had never really 
seriously called her onee-sama after becoming friends with her. Such 
disrespect, Shizuru thought. &quot;I forgot how common they are in this 
region. I thought I heard a call or two, but I was distracted.&quot;

&quot;Really,&quot; Natsuki replied sarcastically, pulling away from Shizuru and 
standing up. She extended a hand to the woman still resting on the grass 
below, who accepted it. Natsuki pulled her up, and Shizuru began to 
casually walk back toward the brown stallion of Count Kruger&#39;s that had 
been left to graze while the two women sat by the lakeside.

&quot;Besides, I thought you enjoyed the company of wolves?&quot; Shizuru asked as 
Natsuki politely helped her onto the horse. &quot;You father has two of them 
for pets, after all.&quot;

Natsuki made some kind of unintelligible noise in response as she 
climbed up onto the horse. Then, once settled, she managed to coherently 
speak. &quot;Those would be the cubs of two wolves I adopted when I was 
little. Hunters came through and got rid of their parents just after 
they were born, and I felt sorry for them. I feed them scraps when no 
one was looking, and they sort of became members of the family after a 
while.&quot;

&quot;How... cute,&quot; Shizuru commented, smirking to herself. It wasn&#39;t often 
that one got to see the lighter side of Natsuki Kruger, who always so 
businesslike and stern. It was the price one paid for taking on so much 
responsibility so young. Shizuru much preferred the side of her 
girlfriend that babytalked to canines (even if she tried to make sure no 
one else was around when she did it).

The headmistress naturally glared from where she sat, and elbowed 
Shizuru as best she could. &quot;Don&#39;t even start with that unless you&#39;d like 
to be punched in the jaw.&quot;

&quot;So harsh. I did not teach you to act like such a hellion,&quot; the other 
woman countered. She opened her mouth to say more, but found herself 
stopping short as a glowing light from the skies caught her attention. 
She watched two separate trails streak across the faint stars above. 
&quot;Shooting stars?&quot;

Natsuki, also watching the objects, was lost in thought for a moment. 
&quot;No. They&#39;re on an impact trajectory. Looks like they&#39;re moving too slow 
for any real sort of meteor. We&#39;d best hurry to the keep and get in 
contact with Garderobe.&quot;

Shizuru sighed as Natsuki galloped back to her father&#39;s keep. So much 
for the vacation.

- - -

The two entered the keep, the guards sliding out of their way without a 
moment&#39;s hesitation after seeing the determined look on Natsuki&#39;s face &#150; 
the one that always showed whenever she felt that her authority was 
essential. Once inside, the pair headed up a flight of stairs, greeting 
the few people who said hello to them. They would have optimum GEM 
transmission and privacy from one of the keep&#39;s lookout points, and so 
they headed in that direction.

&quot;Mistress,&quot; one of the servants, who had tended to Natsuki as a little 
girl, called. &quot;Do you know what that was? Was it a comet?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t know yet,&quot; Natsuki responded, never slowing down her pace. &quot;I 
intend to contact the rest of Garderobe&#39;s administration to see if they 
have determined what it was. Will you excuse me?&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am, forgive me,&quot; she said. Then, finally acknowledging 
Shizuru&#39;s presence, she nodded politely. &quot;Have a safe evening, Miss 
Viola.&quot;

Shizuru gave her a smile and continued on her way, following Natsuki 
through the building. She had visited once or twice during holiday 
breaks, but still hadn&#39;t been there enough to know the place by heart. 
As the pair headed up to the top of the structure, she couldn&#39;t help but 
say, &quot;Ara, I guess the world will fall apart the moment we go on 
vacation. You were right. I apologize.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re forgiven.&quot;

The two opened a large wooden door that led out to an observation point. 
Natsuki nodded to the guards to get out of there, and they headed inside 
for the moment. Privacy obtained, Natsuki fixed her eyes in the 
direction of where she thought the objects had fallen. It was in the 
direction of Windbloom&#39;s capital, but surely it had been farther away 
than that. She tapped on her GEM, trusting that either Irina or Yoko 
would be there to handle her transmission.

&quot;This is the headmistress. Have you identified the object that just 
hit?&quot; She demanded.

It took a few moments before someone, Yoko, responded. &quot;Sara, Nao and 
Maya were on patrol, so they swung by the crash site of the nearest one 
immediately. The other will take some time to get to.&quot;

Neither Shizuru nor Natsuki were calmed by how Yoko was almost skirting 
around an explanation. The headmistress wouldn&#39;t stand for that. &quot;Then 
what was it, Yoko?&quot;

&quot;You might not believe it, but...&quot;

&quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;Sara reported that it was a vessel that crashed. Many of Windbloom and 
Aries&#39; old technology ships became unaccounted for after all the recent 
chaos, but this has markings in foreign text that seem to indicate it is 
affiliated with Earth. The occupants are able to communicate, but their 
language patterns are vastly different. We recovered two from the crash 
site, and both are Otome.&quot; Yoko paused then, knowing she was getting 
ahead of herself.

Shizuru and Natsuki were both, expectedly, speechless for quite a while. 
Then, Shizuru managed to form a reply. &quot;Yoko, are you telling us that we 
are dealing with aliens?&quot;

&quot;Well... I don&#39;t know! Their customs are so entirely different from 
anything I&#39;ve seen and their language is structured in a similar but 
distinct way &#150; perhaps a little like the native tongue of Zipang, but 
I&#39;m not sure.&quot; Yoko could almost see the look Natsuki was giving her. 
&quot;Look, all the old literature from just after the colonization kept 
saying that there were some kind of Otome on Earth and that a reunion 
was always expected. Don&#39;t you remember reading &quot;The Maiden&#39;s Lament&quot; 
when you were in school?&quot;

Yes, yes, she read it. It was a mandatory novella for first year Corals. 
It was a tale about one of the first proto-Otome who had fought 
alongside the legendary Fumi. While it was written generation or two 
after its events, it chronicled the life of the Otome known as Victoria, 
who carried a picture of her elder sister with her to Earl. She had 
prayed that they would be reunited and that the colonies and the home 
world would unite again some day, but it didn&#39;t ever happen. It served 
as a text that demonstrated the life at the time and certain bits of 
Fumi&#39;s life history, but was otherwise somewhat vague about the War of 
the Twelve Kings and the other Otome.

&quot;The reason our ancestors came here was to avoid nuclear winter on 
Earth. Do you think anyone could have survived that?&quot; Natsuki 
questioned, not willing to embrace such flights of fancy just yet.

&quot;Perhaps they&#39;re from another colony?&quot; Yoko suggested.

&quot;Or perhaps they&#39;re just some punks looking to get famous by staging an 
elaborate hoax,&quot; Natsuki grumbled. She looked to her side. Shizuru 
seemed lost in thought. She couldn&#39;t have possibly thought that any of 
that was true, could she? Shizuru was a bit of a dreamer, but not enough 
to even consider a great hero coming down from Earth to bring them all 
back.

&quot;In any case, you and the Archmeister should return to oversee 
interrogation and an international meeting. The twelve kingdoms are 
assembling in Windbloom to discuss the craft and its occupants. Midori 
also indicated that she would be arriving as well,&quot; Yoko informed. &quot;The 
meeting is to be held tomorrow at midday.&quot;

&quot;Very well. We&#39;ll return to the academy now. Expect us to arrive within 
two hours,&quot; Natsuki declared, estimating the time it would take to get 
back to the capital using their robes. No sense in staying another night 
at the keep.

Natsuki closed the connection and activated her robe, coating her body 
in blue and gray. She prepared to take off, but paused when she saw 
Shizuru fail to follow behind. The brunette nodded her head back to the 
door. &quot;What of our things?&quot;

Oh, right. The headmistress paused, turned, and headed back into the 
hall. They had arrived conventionally, and had a few bags of belongings 
in their room. They could not carry them back to Windbloom. She spotted 
someone who she could trust walk down the hall. It would have been 
polite to say goodbye, anyway. &quot;Mother!&quot;

Countess Saeko, who was walking with two of her attendants, paused and 
turned around. Her face, so similar to Natsuki&#39;s own, contorted into a 
look of confusion. Then, making the connection, the elder woman sighed. 
&quot;You&#39;re already leaving? The meteors are that much of an emergency?&quot;

Natsuki walked up to her, Shizuru following behind quietly, and tried 
her best to explain. She tended to revert back to childlike behavior 
whenever she was in the presence of her mother, regardless of her own 
social rank. &quot;Ah, well, yes, I&#39;m afraid so. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll be back in 
no time. I still have plenty of vacation days left.&quot;

The dark haired countess tapped Natsuki on the head with a folded piece 
of paper she had been folding. &quot;Of course you do. You&#39;ve barely taken a 
holiday since you&#39;ve become headmistress. I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re diligent, 
but don&#39;t overwork yourself.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Mother,&quot; Natsuki surrendered, her gaze shifting to the ground. 
Shizuru smiled all the while, amazed at how much she looked like a young 
kid again.

&quot;If you have to go, I suppose you don&#39;t have a choice,&quot; Saeko sighed. 
She gave both Natsuki and Shizuru a small and quick hug. &quot;Take care, the 
both of you.&quot;

&quot;Farewell, Countess Kruger,&quot; Shizuru replied with a bow.

Saeko pivoted around and began to walk away, and as she did so, she 
smiled and waved an arm. The comment that followed, she knew, would be 
picking on her poor daughter, but it simply had to be said. Shizuru had 
been treated like an outsider by a great number of the other 
aristocrats. &quot;Please, Shizuru, you might as well be calling me Mother.&quot;

Shizuru waved. &quot;Goodbye, Mommy.&quot;

&quot;Shizuru, go out that door and start flying before I do something I&#39;ll 
regret.&quot; Fists were tightened in embarrassed rage. That was not 
motivation to get her to take another holiday any time soon. Mommy. 
Honestly. Was she four years old?

Shizuru held up her hands in surrender, a smile never leaving her face 
as she exited back out to the observation point. Summoning her robe, 
Shizuru dropped herself off the ledge as if she was going to commit an 
act of suicide. But, a few dozen feet before hitting the ground, her 
glowing robe propelled her up towards the skies and off towards 
Windbloom. Natsuki was right behind, also diving off the side of the 
building. Achieving their robes&#39; maximum atmospheric velocity, they 
darted through the skies. A Column&#39;s work was never done.

Aries Republic, Borderlands

Haruka Armitage followed the second, more distant flaming object down 
the ground, tracking it with the utmost precision. It landed in the 
mountains, and while it took her some time to close in and find its 
landing spot, her skills as an Otome paid off. A small trail of debris 
and destruction had followed in the object&#39;s wake, trees having been 
knocked down as it slammed into the ground. She had been expecting a 
fairly large rock that she could have easily hurled back into space or 
taken back to the presidential residence for study and research.

What she found, however, was something... well, otherworldly. It was all 
metal, and was clearly some kind of vehicle. It appeared too awkward to 
be something meant primarily for atmospheric flight, so perhaps it was 
for space travel. Had that ship she tossed into space while she was at 
Windbloom finally come back down? No, that was impossible. Her throws 
were clearly too good for that to happen. That thing must have been 
around the moon, nay, the sun, by now.

&quot;Yukino, I&#39;ve located the birdie, and --&quot;

&quot;Bogey, Haruka.&quot;

&quot;Right, that&#39;s what I said. I&#39;ve located the bogey, and you&#39;re not gonna 
believe what it is,&quot; Haruka commented, diving lower for a closer look. 
&quot;The Columns were right. There&#39;s a ship out here, too. Same kind of 
markings.&quot;

&quot;Check to see if anyone&#39;s inside. The other one had passengers,&quot; Yukino 
instructed from her position within the safety of the presidential 
residence.

&quot;Right!&quot; The blonde Otome smirked and began to drop down to the surface, 
making sure that she looked daring enough for that silly television show 
that aired every week. She still wasn&#39;t sure whether she was flattered 
or creeped out to know that a bunch of guys were running after her with 
a camera. Maybe they hadn&#39;t been able to follow her this time. But, just 
to make sure there were plenty of good potential shots, she had to look 
absolutely daring.

She marched up to the ruined vessel, her face painted with determination 
and unquestionable authority. She found what looked to be like some sort 
of hatch, and she pounded on it. Upon receiving no response, she punched 
a hole through it and tore it off, tossing it several feet away &#150; like 
she was ripping through Styrofoam rather than what was probably some 
sort of composite metal sturdier than titanium. The Otome poked her head 
into the interior, but saw that it was barren. Advanced technology, none 
the less. The Republic could probably use it to their advantage, really.

&quot;Nope, I don&#39;t see anyone in here,&quot; Haruka informed. &quot;Maybe they 
ejected. Or maybe it was a drone or something. Ah, wait, never mind. 
There&#39;s footprints over here. They must have gotten out.&quot;

Haruka followed the footprints like a bloodhound on the chase. She 
hovered over them, not wanting to leave any of her own lest she or 
anyone else get confused later on. They went into a nearby forested 
area, and Haruka ducked and weaved around branches and trunks as she 
entered. There, the trail became nigh impossible to follow. Now, if she 
were a mysterious astronaut from Earth, where would she go?

The hairs on the back of her neck began to stand up, her body signaling 
that her position was very vulnerable. What if these people were 
hostile? She had seen dozens of sci-fi movies, and everyone had 
essentially been training her to prepare for an alien invasion. Of 
course they were hostile. In what movie had aliens been kind and 
helpful. She tightened her muscles and ducked low, her eyes scanning the 
darkness around her for any kind of movement.

Instinct forced her to move before thought could. Haruka dropped to the 
ground entirely as she heard a whistling noise, and narrowly avoided 
being decapitated by some kind of saber. She looked up, spotting two 
individuals, probably women due to their shape and form, who had sprung 
up out of cover among the undergrowth. They were covered in heavy black 
cloaks, but they were soon tossed aside. Yes, they were women, now in 
nothing more than form hugging combat suits of some kind. Haruka jumped 
back and out of the way. They were supposed to be Otome, right? The 
other ship had Otome in it.

&quot;I am Meister Armitage! I&#39;m with the Otome. Stand down immediately, or 
you will receive a beating you will not forget&quot; she demanded. A good way 
to start interstellar relations, she thought.

The two strange women, both with some sort of comet symbol on their 
bodies that she swore looked familiar, did not react positively to that 
statement. The second charged and lunged, and Haruka spun out of harm&#39;s 
way, materializing her giant flail and swinging it around to counter the 
attack. Both of her foes leapt out of the way, and she was, quite 
honestly, impressed with their skills. They were not Otome, yet they 
moved just as well. Perhaps they were cohorts of that Midori woman. She 
seemed to possess similar strength.

Haruka unleashed a second massive attack, and again, the two dodged. A 
third attempted to ambush her from behind after leaping down from a 
tree, but Haruka shot out of the way using her robe&#39;s flight function. 
She moved laterally rather than attempt to fly up into trees, and 
skidded to a halt a few feet away. All three then began to race towards 
her, one taking to the trees again. The blonde moved out of the way of 
one attack and blocked a second with the chain of her weapon. Moving 
into a back flip, she avoiding a third diving strike from above.

It was then she noticed that each had some sort of device wrapped around 
their upper arm, a faint red glow emitting from a row of indicators that 
no doubt corresponded to it being on or off. Were they using that to 
maintain their strength and speed &#150; something like Midori&#39;s REM device? 
She had little time to continue pondering. Their triple assault 
continued.

She blocked two more saber attacks with her chain and flung her weapon 
out to stop the third from successfully closing. Her weapon slammed 
through a tree trunk and knocked the giant thing down, everyone 
scattering out of the way before they could be crushed. With a series of 
snaps, the tree slammed into the ground, and Haruka took the time to go 
on the offensive. She lashed out with her weapon again, but it did not 
connect. The one she had been aiming for, some puny little kid with hair 
that had been dyed blue who should have been too young to move like 
that, jumped up into a different tree to avoid being hit.

Haruka spun and flung her weapon out once more, this time wrapping it 
around the legs of one of the others. The enemy fell to the ground with 
an unceremonious crash, her limbs tangled in the chain. Haruka jumped up 
and prepared land a kick right in the subdued woman&#39;s gut to knock her 
out, but was prevented from doing so. In the middle of her leap, she was 
tackled by the third and seemingly eldest of her enemies. Haruka was 
slammed into the ground, giving the other two foes time to regroup.

Haruka kicked her opponent off of her with a bit of a hiss. The woman 
started to fall back but recovered, stopping a few feet away. Another 
swing of the flail caused them to scatter, the weapon kicking up dirt 
and stone from the ground below. Like a rocket, Haruka shot forward, her 
Otome robe propelling her forward. Using the velocity to her advantage, 
she landed a hard superman punch right on the leading enemy&#39;s jaw, 
knocking her out.

The two who remained only seemed to fight harder after that, angered 
over the injury of what could have arguably been their unit leader. One 
darted in and sent a volley of saber strikes to Haruka, all of which 
were expertly avoided or blocked. Haruka stepped in, placing her leg 
behind her foe&#39;s, and knocked her to the ground with a shove. She 
followed up with a kick that slammed down on her gut, and she too was 
rendered unconscious.

That left the youngest one, and the one Haruka did not want to even try 
to seriously hurt. So, as the youth stormed at her without hesitation, 
showing some degree of fanaticism in her assault, Haruka slid to the 
side and caught her body in the chain of her flail. She tightened it, 
capturing the younger girl within the weapon. Haruka then bopped her on 
the head with her gloved hand.

&quot;You should be in school!&quot; She scolded. The blue haired girl simply 
spouted out some insult in a different language. She sounded, in some 
way, like a certain tea drinking woman who had bested her on all her 
exams during their days in school. That just made it worse. &quot;Yeah, well, 
back at ya, kiddo.&quot;

&quot;Haruka, what&#39;s happening?&quot; Yukino&#39;s voice echoed through her GEM, 
Haruka only now finally hearing her calls now that the fight had ended.

Haruka took a breath to recover her proper voice, and replied with, &quot;I 
don&#39;t know what the others found, but these guys were certainly not 
Otome and definitely not friendly. Got in a fight with three of them. 
Two are unconscious and one is subdued. Haven&#39;t found any others. Send 
someone to take them back, will you?&quot;

&quot;Support unit will be on its way, then. Are you all right?&quot; Yukino 
inquired.

&quot;Is that a serious question?&quot; Haruka said with a laugh. &quot;Of course I&#39;m 
all right. You&#39;re crazy if you think a fourteen year old could beat me 
up. It was easy as could be.&quot;

Well, maybe not that easy, but it could have been worse. She sat down on 
one of the unconscious girls with a sigh. The support unit wouldn&#39;t take 
long. Perhaps ten minutes. Until then, all she could do was sit and 
wait. She turned her gaze to the younger enemy, who simply glared at her 
like she was some disgusting animal that should not even be in her 
presence.

&quot;What&#39;s your name, kid?&quot; Haruka asked. All she received in response was 
silence. Haruka groaned in frustration. Ah, well. At the very least, 
they had three prisoners ready for interrogation by both Aries and the 
other eleven nations after they assembled. It would no doubt help solve 
the issue once and for all. Still, she had to admit that for a potential 
hoax, this was perhaps too elaborate. Two foreign ships, one with 
friendly passengers and the other with hostile ones &#150; none of whom 
seemed to easily speak their language. Suspicious, at the very least.

More notes, for reference:

While both shows obviously have to be in Japanese for their main 
audience to understand things, the reversal of family/given names in 
Otome seems to indicate, at least to me, that traditional Japanese would 
not be their primary language. With the influence of German (meister 
[master, schwarz [black, and so forth) and with more English in use in 
the series, I have the Otome cast speaking English with a German kick to 
it by default. The exception is Zipang. While speaking the 
English/German mix, it also has a language more firmly grounded in 
Japanese. </pre>
