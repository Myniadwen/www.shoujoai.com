Notes

Just a few short things concerning the nature of this short story. So, 
for those who live behind the Moon and cannot guess already this will 
be a place in the future (and right now) for scenes that take place 
during the epic crossover/fusion known as Soul Lights that are of a 
more adult nature or to be more precise those to which a NC-17 would 
certainly apply. These installments can be read individually but make 
the most sense in combination with the main story. They usually are 
set in-between scenes of a certain part of the Soul Lights. While I 
will indicate there, I will not cross-reference in the story directly, 
for now at least.

Now, enjoy.

******************************

&lt;Dusk 01 (Hotaru)&gt;
Drawing in a sharp breath the woman underneath me trembled slightly as 
I made my ascent up the length of her body in a seductive crawl that 
was at the same time meant to be horribly aggravating. Emerald eyes 
followed entranced, shining with a mixture of wonder and desire. I 
held the gaze with my own, making sure that Makoto knew exactly who 
was in control here and was rewarded with a shudder of arousal. That 
reaction increased as I gently, with agonizing tenderness, brushed 
over the respective breast with my left hand, stroking with a leisure 
pace. My other hand settled next to the brunette&#39;s head to stabilize 
myself as I leaned down for a kiss.
	Looking at us from the angle of an outside observe, it had to be 
hard to believe that the other woman was actually the inexperienced 
one here and yet I could feel it in the language her body was 
speaking, decades of knowledge coming to the forefront. Knowledge by 
my past mate that hadn&#39;t been lost in all those millennia. Makoto on 
the other hand was surprisingly unsure of herself, letting me guide 
and take the initiative in pretty much everything up to now. It was 
obvious that - excluding that one night we both didn&#39;t wish to 
remember right now - the normally self-confident woman with a mirage 
of talents wasn&#39;t entirely sure what to do herself. I could have made 
this easy by speeding up the pace. While Kino Makoto was to be 
considered inexperienced, I doubted Jupiter was. With just the right 
kind of pressure and level of passion... But this wasn&#39;t supposed to 
be a wild night. That would probably only help to drown our own angst 
over Minako. No, this was going to be sensual, finding comfort through 
genuine affection and not simple need.
	Not to mention, I added to myself with a imaginative grin as I 
continued to press into the contact of our lips, tongues entangling 
into a steadily heating dance, I loved a challenge and I had decided 
for myself if Makoto needed the guidance, she&#39;d get a good dose of 
what I learned from Peitho.
	A moan was mostly drowned by the continuing kiss. The source of 
the noise was the first flick of the other woman&#39;s nipple as my 
explorations southwards became bolder and more defined. Adding a bit 
more of pressure, I pulled out of the kiss sharply, leaving Makoto 
gasping and a bit startled at the sudden loss of contact. That changed 
quickly into a series of quickly increasing moans and groans, both in 
volume and quantity. I had moved my attention down to the throat, 
licking only, but that in long, leisure movements, while my left hand 
had not only picked up pressure, now firmly massaging the supple 
flesh, but also adding the stimulation of a firmer squeeze of the 
nipple between my fore and middle finger. That action drew out a gasp 
every time, making me smile in pleasure at the responsiveness of the 
other woman. My right hand was now stroking her cheek with a gentle 
slowness.
	&quot;Hotaru,&quot; Makoto practically whined as I temporarily stopped my 
treatment of her breast, letting the hand roam over her side and back, 
a bit southwards, leaving a trail of butterfly touches over her 
stomach before resting it there, feeling the rise and fall signaling 
the other&#39;s rising arousal. She was still pretty much inactive though; 
obviously still a bit unsure in her subconsciousness over the entire 
act.
	Well, there were ways to change that.
	I gave no warning as one lick on the taller woman&#39;s throat 
suddenly drew a line down to and over her chest, not halting when 
meeting the previously treated flesh of her breast until it met the 
nub of her nipple upon which mouth joined tongue in a flash, sucking 
greedily. Makoto&#39;s back arched up from the mattress and one hand came 
shooting up to take a firm grasp on a patch of hair, pressing my head 
further into its present action. &quot;Kami-sama!&quot; the brunette rasped out 
and I could very well imagine the breathlessness she had to be feeling 
right now. All too well, I could still remember Peitho doing similar 
things to me on occasions.
	The right hand came down to stimulate the other breast during 
which I added a slight bit of teeth to the pressure on the left one. 
The hand entangled in my hair intensified its grip to nearly painful 
levels; yet to me that was more a motivation, a signal that I was 
doing all the right things. The body of my roommate and comrade was 
giving off all the right signs, residing somewhere between relaxed in 
the pleasure and tensed in anticipation.
	I continued the treatment, basking in the choir of moans and 
encouragements in the form of a repetitive use of my name from above. 
My left hand was slowing its advance further down, brushing and 
tickling the bellybutton briefly before moving on. Makoto was still 
deciding whether to giggle or moan at the contact when the first touch 
reached the uppermost outer edge of her most intimate area, stopping 
just short of actual contact.
	&quot;Hotaru-chan, onegai,&quot; Makoto pleaded and my lips coiled into a 
wicked grin while still busy sucking on the nipple which produced a 
curious reaction and even more curious sound from their owner. I knew 
I was pushing my luck with the teasing, threatening to draw out a 
reaction from Jupiter. Frankly, a part of me was actually looking for 
it. With an audible slurping sound, I dislodged my mouth, only to put 
it back into place on its twin, drawing back the left hand to reassume 
attention where I had just left off. Instead of completely mirroring 
the action, I decided to tease with tiny nips on one and drawing 
circles with one fingernail for quite some time on the other. Just as 
I felt Makoto shift and muscles tense in preparation of doing 
something, anything, to end the torture of my slow pace I bit down 
hard once, simultaneously digging harder into the skin beneath my 
fingernail.
	Again the body beneath arched and I shifted my gaze slightly to 
catch my brunette friend throwing back her head in a silent scream of 
rapture. The silent part was soon-to-be revised. While my left hand 
had retreated, it had just been a momentary setback in my advance. Two 
fingers of my right hand slipped past the veil and were immediately 
swallowed by an already aroused and more than expecting center. I gave 
another bite, adding a third digit below and making Makoto&#39;s body 
quake in response. The room was quickly filling with an intoxicating 
smell, prompting me to shift tactics swiftly.
	I just had to have a taste.
	The second hand joined the first still tangled in my hair as I 
ducked down with my head, all but abandoning the lengthy attention 
directed at the full breasts, and I made a first, testing sweep with 
my tongue over the - physically - older woman&#39;s outer folds. Makoto 
was close to the edge, I could feel it, trembling, waiting to erupt 
just underneath. And while the reaction to the teasing and slow pace 
was pleasing, my own arousal had heightened tremendously already. It 
was time to take this up a notch.
	Widening the passage before me with one hand, I withdrew the 
already buried fingers and proceeded to suck on them, getting my first 
taste of what was to come. I was aware of my lover&#39;s gaze watching me, 
and I lifted my head briefly to meet emerald eyes looking down, desire 
sparkling in vivid flames and flaring in response when I licked my 
lips, salvaging the slightly bitter but nonetheless tasty smell. My 
lips turned up in a crooked, devilish smile and Makoto&#39;s eyes widened 
as I proceeded to go right for the source.
	Millennia old reflexes took over. They might have been a bit 
rusty, not having been put to any use in such a long time but as they 
say, it was like riding a bicycle. Once you learned how to, you never 
forgot. Phoebe obviously delighted in the fulfillment too, it had far 
too long since I had been so close to anyone, in the most intimate of 
ways. Of course, this was different from Peitho, roles somewhat 
reserved, but that was all right. There was enough affection there 
that had blossomed over the last month that I was sure not to regret 
this night. Especially since this time I would remember and savor 
every detail.
	Cries of ecstasy reached my ears, signaling unmistakable success 
and the body above me tensed noticeably, exactly at the moment my 
tongue slipped past the last protection of Makoto&#39;s core. My tactics 
were earning their full reward as the first release rippled through 
the strong body at my total mercy, the previous leisure pace having 
served its purpose in stimulating my victim to a degree that just 
needed a single, focused touch to yield results.
	My mouth latched around Makoto&#39;s center, ready to eagerly accept 
the flow of juices exploding from deep within. The cries turned into a 
shriek and the hands in my hair were now practically clawing, not that 
I minded. Swirling my tongue around, I began to draw out the release.
	My lover&#39;s restraint and reluctance to actively participate was 
pretty much overridden then and I smiled against the current object of 
my focus when I heard the request pressed out between pants, cries and 
shrieks. &quot;Hotaru... Kami... I... I want to taste you too.&quot;
	Waiting for the current quake to subside, I momentarily pulled 
back and in one fluid motion pushed my body upwards, performing a 
perfect hundred-eighty degree turn in midair and landing with my 
thighs positioned perfectly on either side of Makoto&#39;s head. The other 
woman gasped in surprise, the impact shaking the bed underneath of us 
slightly. I could easily sympathize; usually having found myself on 
the receiving end of similar agile and flexing maneuvers with Peitho.
	Not giving her - or wanting to waste - the time to recover, I 
quickly resumed what I was doing before and soon found my efforts 
rewarded and mirrored, finally meeting and responding to my own 
building cravings.

******************************

	Minutes had passed by and I was slightly amazed by Makoto&#39;s 
stamina. Both in giving and receiving. And all that without giving way 
to Jupiter. I suspected it had something to do with her Martial Arts 
training. Not that I was at all complaining. I sighed in rapture, 
feeling another eruption ripple through me. While at the beginning 
somewhat clumsy, Makoto had proven to be a fast learner and was doing 
some incredible things with her fingers and tongue.
	Exhaling sharply, I let my excitement and appreciation over the 
treatment of my own nether region travel straight to my lover&#39;s. I 
hadn&#39;t been aware how much I had longed for the feeling again. Not the 
sex alone, but more the connection, the deep understanding bond shared 
between lovers and especially between two with a pure star seed. A 
firm squeeze of my buttocks elicited another groan from my lips and I 
had to abandon my position in favor of sitting up straight as a tiny 
flares of electricity shot through my system. Makoto didn&#39;t seem to 
mind the lack of responsiveness, for once having obtained control as I 
was pulled more firmly onto her face. While experienced in mind, this 
body was still rather fresh to all the new sensations and in a way 
that was actually further exciting.
	I grasped the headboard behind me and let out a loud moan, 
succumbing to the feelings my lover&#39;s eager tongue was awakening 
within me, previously buried somewhere in a far away place, kept away 
so long... I really hadn&#39;t been all that sure about this, mostly 
making the move by instinct. Now though I realized that part of what 
had motivated me tonight to take this step was not just alone the 
growing attraction between us but also the effort to ignore the 
loneliness, the craving for a partner. The frustration provided 
through Minako&#39;s pretty much untouchable status had grown steadily and 
Makoto was offering another option. Not a substitute by far. There was 
something linking us together in this life, I could feel it. Even now. 
Especially now. Here in the air around us, the intensity was 
positively overwhelming. This wasn&#39;t just a simple act of comfort. Too 
much bonding had happened on an emotional level already. I would 
define this more as a logical consequence that we had been avoiding 
for some time now...
	Whatever it was though, it felt damn good!
	Coming down from the quickly cresting wave, I could feel that 
my, and thus surely Makoto&#39;s reserves as well, were near exhaustion. 
While I would have no problem lengthening this by slipping into our 
Senshi identities, this was supposed to be a night for us. Just Tomoe 
Hotaru and Kino Makoto. Nothing binding or powerful and wild.
	Sliding down from my current position straddling the brunette&#39;s 
head I turned around on the bed, holding out my hand. Makoto didn&#39;t 
hesitate for a second to grasp it and without much further prompting 
we came together in a crushing kiss, filled with the passion of the 
previous minutes. I wrapped my arms around her neck while sliding one 
leg over her own and the other in between, instantly applying pressure 
as our centers collided, rubbing against each other.
	&quot;Hotaru-chan!&quot; Makoto gasped, her voice more like a harsh 
whisper.
	&quot;Yess...&quot; I croaked out in a mixture of a hiss and a moan. I 
could feel the brunette&#39;s arms around me, her strong hands massaging 
my back and beginning to dig into skin as the level of arousal was 
pushed higher and higher up in the realms of ecstasy. Once again I 
sought the other mouth pushing deep inside, meeting in a dance 
practically as old as time.
	For these brief moments, all depressing thoughts of Minako or 
Peitho or anyone else ceased to exist. For that alone, and for so much 
more, I was very grateful. Maybe this was really going to be the start 
of something new, something that would do both of us a whole lot of 
good.

******************************

&lt;Dusk 02 (Makoto)&gt;
The heat was quickly increasing in the small room that I sometimes was 
using for training or meditation purpose. I had thought that I had 
worked at least some of my frustration out of my system but as soon as 
Hotaru had found me here I realized that I was still filled with quite 
a bit of tension. The dark-haired girl was obviously seeing right 
through, however, I doubted that I was ready to talk quite yet and 
neither was I ready to really deal with whatever revelations she had 
to make.
	Purple eyes looked up at me unblinking but half-lidded, grateful 
actually. This day had been rough for both of us, for various reasons 
from which the other only shared a few for now. Before we were ready 
to talk about them, all those negative emotions had to be worked out. 
Hotaru knew that. I knew that. We were in perfect consent about this.
	A shudder run through the smaller body pressed up against me as 
my hands wandered to her butt, resting there a moment, before starting 
to roam the flesh beneath through the thin fabric of her skirt. In 
response, I could feel her own hands on my back, tugging at the shirt 
in an unexpected display of frantic need for contact.
	My body was responding to the growing passion instinctively and 
before I could stop myself I had hooked my hands under the girl and 
lifted her legs up, simultaneously moving forward until we collided 
with one of the walls. Hotaru wrapped her legs around my waist 
tightly, increasing friction. Amazed but not at the least halted by 
the responsiveness, I once again captured the other woman&#39;s lips and 
proceeded to slip under her shirt, moving with the pace unconsciously 
though obviously not unwillingly set by both of us. Just holding her 
by sheer contact alone, I pressed forward with my tongue, invading her 
mouth and finding her own tongue waiting to coil around mine in a 
dance of fierce passion. My hands found their quarry and Hotaru moaned 
loudly into the kiss, biting momentarily on my tongue, which only 
emboldened my movements below. Our bodies were pressed flush together 
and I had readjusted my palms so that they were pushing into the 
supple flesh of the younger girl&#39;s breast, one nipple between fore and 
middle finger each.
	The flaring heat between us was enough to practically erase the 
barrier put up by the still existing clothing. Entranced by purple 
eyes sparkling with a powerful lust, I was once again surprised and 
also awed by the wildness the normally shy and quiet girl could 
generate in those moments of unguarded intimacy. Tiny tremors began to 
intensify quickly though neither of us had made any direct contact 
below the waist other than Hotaru&#39;s legs wrapped around me pressing 
her groin into mine.
	Gasping, the raven-haired girl separated from the kiss that 
seemed to have gone on forever without interruption, pushing her head 
back against the wall and giving off a sound somewhere between a loud 
moan and a muffled scream. Just a moment later the source of the 
reaction hit me as well and my body was wrecked by a short yet 
powerful surge of release. Not near enough to satisfy the fires 
between us, enough to throw away the last bit of reservation though.
	&quot;Need you,&quot; Hotaru rasped out, chin now buried in my right 
shoulder. &quot;Inside... Now!&quot;
	The desperate command startled me for the barest of instances 
before I moved to comply instantly, knowing without needing to be told 
what the other girl wanted. While most of our lovemaking to this point 
was actually rather soft and gentle, I had seen that there was a 
wilder side to Hotaru, a side I could feel emerging in the heat of 
passion inside myself as well.
	Taking a step back, only to let Hotaru&#39;s legs still wrapped 
around me drop back to the ground, I had my hands already free again, 
moving with speed and precision that was part Senshi trait and to a 
great part probably due to my Martial Arts training. Hotaru only 
groaned at the tearing sound as her panties were practically ripped 
off but this time the scream was unrestrained, uncaring whether or not 
someone heard as I quickly slipped my other hand into the already 
rather slippery passage below. I marveled at the absence of even a 
single sign of pain, the younger girl taking the entire size of my 
hand, now clenched into a fist, into her cunt. Instead she instantly 
moved with her hands against the motion. The sheer eroticism of the 
action was enough to push my own lust higher and higher as I began to 
move inside my lover, Hotaru&#39;s hands tangled in and tearing at my 
hair...

******************************

	I wasn&#39;t entirely sure how we made it the short distance over 
the floor to the apartment, not that it really mattered at the moment. 
The situation had changed slightly. We had not made it past the main 
room at all. While intentionally aiming for the bedroom the need had 
become too great. The passion and lust created in the short but 
already wild encounter in the training room had not been satisfied 
nearly enough. Something inside me was steadily rising, straining to 
get out and take this to an even higher level.
	While Hotaru had been voluntarily submissive, that had changed 
upon entering the apartment. Right now I found myself bent forward at 
a somewhat painful level - though easily endurable considering the 
situation - having come up against the back of a chair. My upper body 
was bent forwards so that the underside of my chest was brushing up 
occasionally against the upper edge of the chair while mostly being 
massaged by one eager and insistent hand of my lover. Cupping, 
pinching, pulling, pressing in a steady flow on an artistic level, 
like a musician playing its instrument... And she surely was bringing 
out all kinds of interesting sounds from me!
	I was rocked forward powerfully by another intense shock to my 
core. Hotaru had her hand buried where I had been previously and while 
applying a much slower - relatively put - pace I could freely admit 
that in moments like this it showed truly who was the expert and who 
the novice. When we had first become lovers, I had been rather unsure 
of myself. During our first night Hotaru had to coax me into taking an 
active role for quite some time. Most of what I did, I did by 
instinct, relying on Jupiter&#39;s presence greatly to gauge what and how 
Hotaru needed to be handled in all situations.
	Compared to that, the normally quiet, albino-skinned girl was a 
dynamo of energy and self-confidence. She reminded me a little of 
Minako actually, which only showed where she had learned all this. 
Hotaru wasn&#39;t acting like an eighteen year old student when it came to 
sex but rather like someone who had decades of experiences... Then 
again that was true in a way that only another Senshi was able to 
comprehend. The little Firefly could be sensuous and slow or 
passionate and wild like now or everything in between that spectrum.
	My musings were cut short though as a bolt of fire shot through 
my system, my pelvis had come into contact with the back of the stair 
through the force and speed of Hotaru&#39;s latest thrust, only buffered 
slightly through Hotaru&#39;s own hand. Before I was able to actually 
react to this I felt Hotaru step up behind me pressing her own heat 
against my exposed butt cheeks. Clothing had long since dwindled 
though not entirely discarded. The lower part of my gi was crumpled 
somewhere around my ankles and the top pushed up to chest level with 
Hotaru&#39;s hand moving just below...
	A gasp escaped my mouth as air hit the heated skin in between 
the now torn material.
	Well, or not. Didn&#39;t matter much, I had enough of those. It was 
a good thing that I usually didn&#39;t wear any underwear for training or 
it would have joined the fate of the top already. &quot;Hotaru!&quot; I moaned 
my lover&#39;s name loudly. The smaller body behind me had leaned forward 
pressing her chest into my back and increasing the friction of our 
lower regions. Somehow, she had managed to slip her own core as much 
between my butt cheeks as possible, creating maximal contact. Her 
hand, temporarily stilled inside of me, had been readjusted, now 
pushing in firmly from below.
	Pinned like this I was totally unable to do anything but endure, 
trapped from behind with Hotaru&#39;s upper body pressed into my back, her 
cunt rubbing into my anus, coupled with the weight of her body propped 
on the edge of my own, and both legs entangling my own, giving them no 
room to do more than occasionally twitch. I shuddered visibly, feeling 
the quake building when a tongue was added to leisurely drape over the 
base of my neck. The eruption I could feel building was more powerful 
than everything before...
	Distracted momentarily by the addition of the tongue, I did not 
notice the hand on my breast vanishing before it returned with a 
stunning swiftness. Some kind of material was being wrapped around my 
breasts with agile accuracy. Looking down I realized it was the belt 
usually holding together the training gi... I had no time to question 
as Hotaru, finished with her handiwork of wrapping the black leather 
strap around my breasts like a makeshift chain, gave an experimental 
tug making me moan again. Managing a quick look over my shoulder I saw 
purple eyes staring up at me but there was a kind of ancient quality 
to it that was totally unlike Hotaru...

******************************

	The bedroom door hit the wall with a loud bang but neither of us 
cared. The line that neither of us had dared to entirely cross before 
had now not only been crossed but completely forgotten. The last 
release brought about by Hotaru had cut apart the last restraint and 
my suppressed Senshi power had burst forward with a vengeance clashing 
with Hotaru... no, Saturn&#39;s own. This was not just about Makoto and 
Hotaru anymore. This had become much more and yet was still as pure 
and basic as only the dance as old as time could be. A term flooded my 
mind and stayed there, unwilling to budge even an inch. Senshi mating. 
Simple and unrestrained in its purest form.
	Saturn&#39;s form hit the covers with a thump, eyes staring up at me 
as I hovered on the edge for a moment. The leer was magnetic and 
without waiting another moment, I was on top of her, bringing our 
bodies together once more. Our individual fukus and armor soon became 
a mess resembling the state of our earlier, civilian clothing as hands 
and mouths began to tear and explore in a wild eagerness cresting the 
waves of raw energy around us higher and higher. The need was almost 
intoxicating now and I barely had a sense of anything other than the 
dark-haired warrior underneath, matching my own crazed actions step 
for step.
	No, not crazed. Even in this absolute haze of released power 
mingled with passion, Hotaru/Saturn was still absolutely beautiful. I 
believe I had been fighting this for some time now, similar to my 
early hesitation and clumsiness when it came to the physical. Jupiter 
knew already that unrestrained like this, it was the purest and in a 
bizarre sense most beautiful form that two Senshi could come together. 
And that probably had scared me a bit. Maybe it still did since I 
wasn&#39;t quite sure where our relationship was headed with the added 
factor of Minako...
	Right now all that was irrelevant cast aside by the intensity of 
the moment.
	Energy sizzled, tingling my skin when Saturn clamped her arms 
around my neck, pulling me into a kiss that exceeded even those 
exchanged previously. Green and purple light flared around us as our 
uniforms totally dissolved into bands of light before mingling with 
the tangible power. Neither of us noticed. With a swift motion, guided 
by instinct alone, I thrust one leg in between the other Senshi&#39;s, 
pressing forward so that our cores collided with numbing force. This 
time it was me biting down on my lover&#39;s... mate&#39;s tongue buried 
inside my own mouth. I shifted my weight slightly so that I was now 
totally cutting off any movement from Saturn, pressing her deep into 
the mattress. The Senshi of Silence easily and naturally submitted to 
my superior strength and I could feel the vibration of a happy sigh 
through the hungry kiss.
	No time was lost either as I grinded against the overflowing 
heat covered by my own. Saturn hissed loudly in a short break of 
contact to take in new air, diving right in again. Her hands seemed to 
be everywhere... as were mine, seemingly not able to decide where they 
wanted to be first. The clashing fire below was reaching the peak of 
the wave faster and faster. My eyes fluttered closed and soon were 
being forced to stay this way, the emotions to overwhelming to endure 
with normal senses. Pretty much everything had already been focused on 
the simple action of feeling, my body in a state of impatient 
anticipation.
	A sharp scream made it past the obtrusion of our locked together 
mouths as the eruption finally came rushing over and through us like 
an inferno that would burn as long as there was fuel... And there was 
fuel enough...

******************************

&lt;Dusk 02 (Minako)&gt;
All this was happening too fast to comprehend, too fast to put up a 
sufficient defense against... and frankly... I did not want to. My 
firm control had been blown apart by the furious assault that had 
eventually brought us back to the bedroom. I could not resist, I could 
not hide. Similar as to Artemis, I found myself unable to put up any 
barriers against the unrelenting efforts of this girl. This girl who 
loved me so much that it was frightening. Not just Peitho, the 
incarnation of Venus she believed hidden in me, but me, the whole me. 
I would probably make up all kinds of excuses later but right here, 
unable to flee behind the security of my usual self-control, I could 
acknowledge that I understood the depth of the other&#39;s feelings as 
completely as it was possible to me at this stage.
	Hitting the covers I was barely able to take in another break 
before Hotaru was upon me. Barely, could I recognize the quiet and 
usually rather shy girl. Like a cat, she was crawling over my body, 
making her way upwards. I had expected at least a bit of foreplay but 
judging by the steady trail of kisses and licks leading upwards over 
my legs I wondered just how desperate the other girl was for this... 
No, really, girl was hardly a term to describe the actions of the 
younger-seeming student down below. Never had I ever experienced such 
a furious, initial assault...
	My eyes widened in partial shock even though part of me had 
almost expected it already as my skirt was pushed upwards and the 
raven-haired head disappeared under the material. Just a moment later, 
I felt the pressure of Hotaru&#39;s tongue pressing right inside of me 
through the material of my panties. My hands began to clutch the bed 
sheets as a deep moan burst forth from my lips and even more of my 
rational sense left me.
	Kami-sama, she was good! And that without even making direct 
contact yet. I bit my lip as two fingers slipped underneath the last 
barrier of clothing from below, just circling the outer edge of my 
nether lips. I could hardly believe that I was ready to explode 
already but the inferno building up with an astonishing speed was hard 
to ignore, especially as she began to trace the outlines of the 
sensitive area with her fingers, using just the fingernails...
	And then she pulled away with both tongue and fingers, pulling 
her head out from underneath the skirt, leaving me unsatisfied, on the 
edge of a release that my body craved with a vengeance. Whimpering, I 
could only watch as Hotaru continued her earlier ascent, pushing up 
the simple sweater I wore for comforts purpose. She stopped briefly to 
place a chaste, loving kiss on my belly, making my heart flutter at 
the obvious implication.
	Shudders wracked my body as Hotaru ascended once again, pushing 
the sweater up as she went along, until it was hooked right over my 
exposed cleavage that was only concealed by the thin material of the 
bra. A detached part of my mind analyzed with an imaginative, ironic 
smile that the skill the dark-haired girl displayed was probably all 
knowledge acquired from that first incarnation of Venus, now turned 
back on me. I was too far gone to really complain or further think 
about it though.
	Especially right now. Hotaru had hovered for a couple of 
agonizing moments over my breasts before lowering her head to catch my 
left nipple between her teeth, seemingly not bothered by the obtrusion 
of the undergarment just like she hadn&#39;t been earlier. I cried out 
sharply as the momentary flare of pain wrestled with the pleasure of 
that action but soon found my attention otherwise occupied. I had my 
head partially propped up against the headboard so that I could see 
what the little minx was doing, thus I could observe with growing 
surprise - but also growing arousal - as with her right hand Hotaru 
caught the string holding the front of bra together between two 
fingers and with one forceful tug snapped it apart. Her mouth stopped 
the suckling and nibbling briefly to lift up the material, discarding 
it to the side, her right hand doing the same to the other half. Just 
a moment later, she was at work again and the ferocity of the assault 
was too much to even let me wonder about the aggressiveness of the 
action.
	The state she had left me in previously had not lessened at all, 
the opposite actually. Everything Hotaru did was done with a 
frustrating accuracy, leaving me just right on the edge. If she had 
wanted do, I probably would have come without her even needing to 
touch any of the vital areas. But she didn&#39;t let me, which was driving 
me crazy, while at the same time my body craved more and more of it. I 
did not even restrain my cries and moans, encouraging Hotaru further 
and further.
	Once again, she left me without fulfillment, ending her 
treatment of my chest area just a moment before the inevitable 
explosion. I had had a few lovers already but none of them had ever 
managed to impress me like that, never managed to complete me like 
that even though I hadn&#39;t even reached release yet. And then Hotaru 
was up looming over me. My eyes were defenselessly drawn to purple 
ones and I gasped at the powerful desire, need and unconditional love 
there, fueled only further by a long period of loneliness, frustration 
and the hidden pain of loss...
	I had seen it already back in the adjourning room when Hotaru 
and I had met in that unexpected confrontation minutes ago that had 
ultimately led to this. But now it was even more prominent. And that 
wasn&#39;t just Hotaru. She was part of the entire person, yet this was 
also clearly someone older, someone who had waited, LONGED for this a 
long time. And if there had been one last doubt and restriction about 
allowing this to happen, one last ounce of tight control, it surely 
had been melted right this moment.
	Without a word, I forcefully wrapped my arms around her neck 
pulling her down flat on top of me, lips crushing against each other 
with the force of tidal waves, filled with longing and need long 
suppressed for different reason, however, with equal strength. I 
moaned into the kiss, tongues meshing, exploring, fighting for 
dominance. My body pressed upwards a little under the surprisingly 
unrelenting weight above as I felt Hotaru&#39;s knee press right into my 
center, immediately setting of the eruption bubbling right under the 
surface.
	Still riding the waves of the powerful orgasm, I rearranged my 
hands on my lover&#39;s shoulder, pushing her away. While I might 
acknowledge that Hotaru&#39;s skill was hardly outstanding, I was hardly 
one to just lie back and enjoy. I was a competitive woman after all 
and always had been. I needed more contact, I needed to participate.
	The dark-haired girl gasped as my hands pushed up her shirt and 
top with equal speed and ferocity as she had done before, letting her 
breasts fall free from their concealment. Admiring the sight above me 
with an unconcealed leer for a moment that made Hotaru whimper in 
anticipation, I was soon forced to move forward. She really is good, I 
acknowledged once again as the other girl pressed harder into me, 
sending another tremor through my entire system. My hands practically 
grasped onto her chest for support. Hotaru cried out at the vice-like 
grip I had unconsciously applied, throwing her head back but giving no 
indication whatsoever of discomfort... Narrowing my eyes, I began to 
set to work, promising myself that I would pay her back in kind, even 
if took me all night...

******************************

	She was back between my thighs, this time without any restraint 
of clothing which had been discarded long ago into a chaotic pile 
littering the bed and floor. My hands were tangled in dark haired 
pushing the head below even further inside, whether or not that was 
even possible. I could feel the energy crackling in the air, tangible 
and highly arousing. That had only increased the moment both of us had 
left our horny but still restricted human forms behind, slipping into 
our Senshi aliases pretty much fluently. While Hotaru had obviously 
planned for nothing else, I had let myself be dragged into it without 
complaint, resistance long since gone. And I definitely wasn&#39;t 
regretting it. The connection taken up to this level was transferring 
the intensity of the feelings generated directly to the very soul and 
my whole being felt every shock, every tremor with an intensity that 
was several times greater than what Aino Minako and Tomoe Hotaru could 
have achieved.
	I wasn&#39;t even sure I would have survived under the nymphomaniac 
assault of my lover. Vocal sounds were reduced to unintelligible 
whimpers as Saturn&#39;s mouth was drinking up every bit of juice she 
could find. Wave after wave of pleasures crashed over me and I could 
do nothing else but endure for the moment. She was swirling her tongue 
around my overflowing center, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, while 
occasionally nipping, occasionally actually biting into my lips or 
clit with her teeth. It was soft and sweet, as well as rough and fast 
at the same time, the feelings too overwhelming, my senses too 
overloaded to distinguish the differences any longer.
	As yet another powerful release rocked through me, I was sure 
that I wasn&#39;t able to endure this any longer in this once again 
passive state I was reduced too. My body cried out in both relief and 
regret when I pulled her away from me, ignoring the sting the 
separation of mouth and teeth created. Giving her no time to reorient, 
I used my superior agility to slip around her in one fluent move, 
surprised at myself that I could still find the will and strength to 
move after the treatment. But as I said, I was a competitive woman and 
what I decided to do; I was going to do well. Period.
	My hands slipped under Saturn&#39;s naked form now flat on the bed, 
capturing the smaller but very much appealing mounds with clear 
precision and intent. The other Senshi had made clear before that she 
did not mind, actually longed for a bit of a rougher and faster pace. 
I wasn&#39;t one to disappoint the wishes of my lovers. Tugging forcefully 
with my hands firmly clasped around erect nipples, I pulled a 
surprised Saturn up against me, my own breasts digging into her back 
as I thrust my chest forward.
	Delighted in the moans and helpless cries of pleasure coming 
from Saturn, I took my sweet time working over her breasts, enjoying 
and indulging in a position that finally granted me some more 
dominance. Not that the other girl seemed to mind, judged by the way 
she easily submitted to the position, actually pressing her entire 
body further back into mine. The heat was becoming more and more 
intense, unbearable even. The air had already been rather charged from 
recent activity when we had started, my keen senses noticing this 
right away. It took no genius to figure out why.
	Once again we met in a kiss with Saturn having her head turned 
back towards me. Her hands were covering mine, moving in synch with my 
movements. I could feel the need radiating from the other girl who had 
not even allowed herself release once since this started... some time 
ago. It was time to change that. Reversing the position of our hands, 
it was now me encouraging her movements, as the smaller fingers began 
to frantically massage her own breasts. Satisfied that she got the 
message and assured that abandoning the self-induced pleasure anytime 
soon would soon become a mood point, I let my hands now wonder lower 
and lower on the whitish skin, drawing out gasps and whimpers from my 
lover.
	It did not take long to reach the inevitable final destination. 
Purple eyes peered at me through heavily-lidded eyelids and without 
needing a word of instruction I complied with the request I could see 
in them.
	Saturn&#39;s entire form shook and I watched in quiet fascination at 
the eruption when my hand slammed into her wet center with barely any 
resistance, serving to only revise my opinion of the usually quiet 
girl more and more. The ease with which she took the intrusion made it 
clear that this wasn&#39;t simply due to her Senshi form but that it 
simply had not been the first time recently.
	Saturn ground down onto my hand coiled inside of her, snapping 
me out of my temporary stupor. I wasn&#39;t quite sure who was setting the 
pace but it hardly mattered as the charged air around us was pushed to 
the bursting point quickly. My lover&#39;s eyes fell shut as I watched the 
ongoing inferno engulf her and my heart fluttered again at the contend 
sigh made in the middle of the throes of passion.
	The smaller Senshi was trashing wildly and, as a glance 
downwards assured me, furiously pinching her own nipples in order to 
achieve the maximum amount of pleasure. My free hand, previously 
clutching the soft, dark hair was brought down to join the other 
working inside of my lover&#39;s most private area. Fingers trailed along 
the outer edge and once in a while flicked over her clit, bringing 
forth further mini-explosions.
	My entire body was on fire and I could feel my whole self, soul 
included, connect to the other woman more so than any other lover had 
managed to achieve before. Crying out, I submitted readily to the 
eruption from my center pressed into the cleft of one of Saturn&#39;s 
knees, grinding in feverish need for more contact, more closeness, 
more connection, more fulfillment.
	And again our lips met, surprisingly soft this time. I had lost 
any kind of rational control and all I did, I did purely on instinct. 
If I had been able to analyze I might have noticed that the presence I 
had always felt on the edge of my awareness, especially after the 
night before Hotaru&#39;s birthday, was much more active now, not in 
control but meeting the sensations and feelings pouring into my soul 
readily. Craving, longing, needing.
	But who cared in a situation like this about such trivial 
things? Consequences could wait until tomorrow.
