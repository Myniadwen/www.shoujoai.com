<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 8 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/etercity-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>The news reader smiled cheerfully, &quot;In the aftermath of the concert in 
the park, downloads of the music of Priss Asagiri have increased 
tenfold. In related news, an official release of the Knight Sabers&#39; 
performance is coming soon, the profits being directed to charity.&quot;

&quot;The Crystal Tokyo police have announced that globally murders are at an 
all time low, as are all other incidents of violent crime. The Church of 
the Divine Senshi has issued a statement that this is directly due to 
the wise and just rule of Neo-Queen Serenity, but the Palace itself has 
issued no comment at this time.&quot;

&quot;In other Palace news, sightings of the legendary Duelist Tenjou Utena 
have been reported in Crystal Tokyo...&quot;

Cyber Six simply said, &quot;Off.&quot; The news report cut off, and she smoothly 
slid her transport into place in front of the apartment building. The 
leather clad woman flashed her detective&#39;s badge to the men standing 
watch outside, &quot;Is the CSI team in?&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#146;am,&quot; he nodded, &quot;Grissom&#146;s squad.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Cyber Six nodded and headed in, riding the lift to the correct 
level.

She slowed her pace just a bit as Cyber Six walked down the long 
hallway. Her eyes scanned the route for anything that might be amiss, in 
case it had been missed by the attending officers. The crime scene 
itself was cut off with a temporary force-shield, and she nodded to the 
operator standing by the console, his name-tag reading &#145;Greg.&#146;

&quot;What are we dealing with?&quot; she asked Greg crisply, noting the green 
hair he had. &#39;Probably born with it,&#39; she reminded herself.

&quot;A suicide, of course,&quot; Greg shrugged casually, obviously considering 
this to be just a waste of both the police&#39;s time and energy. He 
covertly took in the slim, athletic woman admiringly, being careful not 
to catch her eye.

She shot him such a harsh look that it made him pale. &quot;And are you 
certain that the evidence backs up that conclusion?&quot; Cyber Six asked 
coldly.

The force field shut down as the five member forensics team made their 
way out of the room. Their leader, an older man, stopped by the two of 
them to say gently, &quot;Go easy on him, Six. Statistically, he&#39;s probably 
right.&quot;

&quot;Anything you can tell me now, Gil?&quot; Cyber Six asked, visibly reigning 
in her temper, just giving him a crisp nod. He had been around long 
enough that she owed him that much respect.

&quot;You know we have to wait,&quot; Grissom was faintly chiding, &quot;the evidence 
doesn&#146;t lie, but we still have to listen to her.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;ve checked for prints and did emf scans of the building,&quot; Sidle said 
after a moment, &quot;I&#146;m not going to stake my life on it but there appears 
no sign of forced entry.&quot; She winced under Grissom&#146;s scolding glance but 
stood up to it.

&quot;Huh.&quot; Cyber Six nodded thoughtfully. &quot;A full visual recording of the 
scene, too?&quot;

&quot;Check the log,&quot; his second in command Willows said a bit crabbily as 
the light brown haired woman scowled up at the black garbed figure, &quot;all 
scanned and collected.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Cyber Six said with a ominous sort of mildness.

Knowing the danger signs very well Grissom herded up his people and got 
them out of there quickly. Cyber Six pushed her hand through her mid 
length dark hair, gazing down at the dead body for the first time.

&#39;Murder may be down,&#39; Cyber Six thought to herself grimly as she studied 
the body, &#39;but somehow, suicide seems to stay a constant.&#39;

The morgue attendants finished bagging up the body, soon carting the 
young man out of the room with a great deal of efficiently. Cyber Six 
cautiously stepped inside, slowly walking around the spacious set of 
rooms. It was all bright and clean, neat even, no signs of struggle, and 
showed the a very careful arrangement. She rather imagined that it 
looked just like the room of any number of happy citizens of Crystal 
Tokyo.

&#39;So why had this one decided to kill himself?&#39; Cyber Six wondered 
grimly.

&quot;I still don&#39;t understand it,&quot; Cyber Six admitted later. She sat on a 
examining table, her long black coat sitting there beside her, leaving 
her in a black T-shirt. She winced slightly as a sample of her blood was 
taken from her arm and then examined by the silver haired woman with her 
silvery visor almost instantly.

&quot;In some ways it&#39;s not all that hard to understand,&quot; Sylia Stingray said 
to her patient quietly as she slid the visor up to reveal her eyes. She 
ran a small scanning device over Cyber Six&#39;s upper body, &quot;It seems that 
some beings can simply grow tired of living.&quot;

&quot;As I said,&quot; Cyber Six smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;ll never understand that.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve always had a strong will to survive,&quot; Sylia acknowledged, &quot;but 
some people just don&#39;t have that.&quot; She studied the readings on her 
console for a moment, &quot;Have you been taking the supplement I prepared 
for you every day?&quot;

&quot;Every day,&quot; Cyber Six answered her firmly. Sylia gave her a look, and 
she had to admit, &quot;Well, most days anyway.&quot;

&quot;Try for everyday, please,&quot; Sylia completely took off her visor to rub 
at her eyes tiredly. &quot;You&#39;re such an unusual case, I don&#39;t want to take 
any chances. You started out as a nearly human being, you had 
proto-boomer technology grafted on to you along with a few odd quirks 
designed by Richter himself, and then you submitted yourself to that 
damned Juraian upgrade,&quot; she growled.

&quot;It did stop my need for the Sustenance,&quot; Cyber Six quietly reminded 
her.

Up until the early 23rd century, she had been dependent on a nearly 
toxic mixture called the Sustenance just to survive. A service to the 
Emperor of Jurai resulted in her gaining the assistance of the eccentric 
scientific genius Washu. She had made a number of alterations to Cyber 
Six&#39;s body in freeing her from her dependency, the effects of which she 
was still seeing.

Sylia grumbled a bit at that, but she did it quietly. &quot;I was wondering 
if you have considered the idea of changing your name?&quot; she asked her. 
&quot;I mean, Von Richter was the one who gave you that name, so...&quot;

Cyber Six held up a hand to stop her, &quot;No, thank you.&quot; Quietly, &quot;Some of 
my best friends knew me by that name, and I would rather not forget 
them.&quot;

&quot;Understandable,&quot; Sylia nodded.

&quot;So what&#39;s the verdict?&quot; Cyber Six finally had to ask after watching 
Sylia putter around in a few moments of silence.

&quot;Your system remains stable,&quot; Sylia said quietly, &quot;though I&#39;m still 
concerned about that nutrient imbalance we were talking about earlier.&quot;

&quot;So I still have to drink that,&quot; Cyber Six made a face. She sighed, 
&quot;Well, it could be worse.&quot;

Sylia gave her a little smile, &quot;Speaking of drinking, I wanted to 
apologize about that blind date I set you up on.&quot;

Cyber Six chuckled softly as she grabbed her coat, &quot;Well, I guess all 
the leather that I wear does give people ideas.&quot;

&quot;I still think I could have spotted that,&quot; Sylia sighed. She perked up, 
&quot;But I did meet a nice young lady yesterday...&quot;

&quot;Sylia!&quot; Cyber Six scolded her before she realized that her doctor and 
friend was only joking. She pulled the coat on smoothly, &quot;What is it 
with you couples, always wanting to see us singles paired up?&quot;
Sylia slinked close, leaning into Cyber Six&#39;s front as she said in her 
best seductive voice, &quot;But you&#39;re so cute, I have to make sure you&#39;re 
paired up just to remove the temptation.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; Cyber Six scoffed. She was glad that Sylia was happily 
married to Mara, or else she just might be tempted.

&quot;I&#39;ll see you at the Locket?&quot; Sylia asked as Cyber Six headed out.

&quot;I&#39;m still doing the bouncer duty,&quot; Cyber Six said with a casual wave.

To be continued...

Author&#39;s Note: Cyber Six is a character from a European comic book who&#39;s 
animated series was later translated into English. Von Richter was her 
creator, as well as the primary villain of the series. In flashbacks she 
was shown as an apparently normal human child, so I&#39;m assuming that she 
was altered surgically into Cyber Six.

The news report is talking about episode #5, &#39;Bubblegum Crisis 2040: 
Hurricane Live! 3003&#39; and Sylia Stingray is also from that story. I 
thought it would be believable that Sylia might have become an android 
doctor, and I also mentioned Washu, from Tenchi Muyo.

Edit: Due to fan requests I&#146;ve added the cast of CSI. They were implied 
in the first draft but in the revisions I&#146;ve formally named them all. 
However, while Gil Grissom may be the same man I have deliberately not 
said if his team are copies of the originals or something similar.</pre>
