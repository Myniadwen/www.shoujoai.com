<a href="../crossover/jetiendo-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>It was a whole week since the start of the trip. The only down side of 
it was that Mr Grinal and Dr Spoona was there. 

It was about nine in the morning Gary finally decided to join the trip 
for only one reason only Tasha was going. All her friends where the wise 
Garnet, The timid Shyst, and the amazing ice climbers 

&quot; Hey KEN,&quot; whispered Gary &quot; I bet you a grand that Ash will kiss, 
before Davis&quot; 

&quot; You swine&quot; barked Ken &quot; I bet a grand that you are wrong. So go off 
with your princess Aladdin&quot; 

Gary was about to walk away but Ken took him to the throat &quot; coward&quot; he 
whispered 

&quot; Jealous&quot; hissed Gary &quot; you used to be a villain just like me but I&#39;ve 
changed. &quot; 

Ken pulled a punch at Gary 

&quot; YOU ARE AN ARROGANT PIECE OF SHIT&quot; Ken roared. &quot; GREEDY, DEVIOUS, 
SLAGGY BASTARD YOU DESERVE NO SYMPATHY &quot; 

&quot;Ken&quot; Gary begged not wanting to fight &quot; I don&#39;t want to fight&quot; 

&quot;OH&quot; Ken hissed loudly so the whole world can hear. &quot; THE PRINCESS WILL 
THINK YOU&#39;RE A COWARD NOW, THE HAG WILL BE UNPLEASED. YOU AND THE BLOODY 
WEIRDOES IN PALLET TOWN, ALADDIN&quot; 

Then all the boys walked away. Then the girls long awaiting them just 
squealed when they all arrived in style. 

&quot; Ok&quot; mr Grinal &quot; quiet please&quot; 

&quot;SHUT UP&quot; Mr OGrady roared then a nice silence went all the way their 
and back at the trip to Forset City
