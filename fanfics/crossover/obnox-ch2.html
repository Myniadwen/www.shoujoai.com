<a href="../crossover/obnox-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Kozue?&quot; the familiar voice asked gently. &quot;Kozue, wake up,&quot; it soon 
began to urge her. Kozue&#39;s eyes slowly fluttered open, to gaze up at 
the worried face of her brother, Miki. He smiled a bit as her eyes 
fully opened, then said, &quot;You were found laying out on the ground in 
front of the dorms.&quot;

&quot;I was found?&quot; she echoed his words, feeling really confused. &quot;Then it 
must have been a dream...&quot;

&quot;A dream?&quot; Miki asked her curiously. He sat down by her bedside on her 
desk chair, his uniform starched and crisp as it always was. There 
seemed to be an odd look on his face, though.

Kozue&#39;s cheeks colored a bit as she remembered. &quot;It was a very strange 
dream,&quot; she started. Then Kozue continuing on, &quot;There was a flying 
saucer, and a strange girl climbed out of it. She flew, but then she 
lost control and fell on top of me. When I helped her up, I touched 
her horns, and she said that we were engaged!&quot;

Kozue blushed harder, faltering a little as she finally made herself 
say, &quot;And then she ki... kissed...&quot;

&quot;Darling!&quot; the happy voice exclaimed as Lum stuck her head around 
Miki&#39;s slim form, &quot;I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re awake! I was so worried!&quot; She 
then launched herself at Kozue, engulfing her in an eager hug!

Kozue struggled in Lum&#39;s grip, unable to get free as the Oni clasped 
Kozue close to her. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; she managed to get out.

Miki smiled a bit uncomfortably at the shocked expression he saw on 
Kozue&#39;s face, as she peered desperately at him over Lum&#39;s bare 
shoulder. &quot;She told me her name&#39;s Lum,&quot; he softly explained, and then 
he shrugged eloquently, &quot;and that she has to be engaged to you.&quot;



&quot;What do you mean, we have to be engaged?&quot; Kozue asked her later, the 
three sitting around a small table in the cafeteria. Lum, who still 
just wore her tiger striped bikini, was drawing the gazes of all the 
students around them, but she didn&#39;t seem to care. Instead, she just 
totally focused on Kozue.

&quot;Amoung the Oni, our horns are very symbolic,&quot; Lum patiently explained 
to her. &quot;Now that you have touched mine,&quot; she blushes a bit, &quot;it means 
that I am no longer pure to the other Oni.&quot;

&quot;I guess it&#39;s kind of like losing your virginity,&quot; Kozue remarked 
thoughtfully, giving a sideways glance to Miki.

Miki blushed at that. &quot;So what do you do now?&quot; he asked Lum curiously.

She grabbed Kozue&#39;s arm firmly. &quot;We&#39;re engaged, and an engaged couple 
should always be together,&quot; she said cheerfully. &quot;I&#39;m going to stay 
with her forever!&quot;

Kozue got a hunted animal look on her face. &quot;We&#39;re not engaged!&quot; Kozue 
loudly protested. &quot;I don&#39;t know about your stupid customs, but I never 
agreed to anything!&quot; she said a bit desperately.

&quot;Yes, we are engaged!&quot; Lum protested a bit louder, drawing the 
attention of the crowd of students around them. Not that they weren&#39;t 
already looking at the pretty girl in the tiger striped bikini, but...

&quot;Oh no, we are not!&quot; Kozue shot back at her angrily. She didn&#39;t notice 
the odd sparks that began appearing around Lum, jumping from her body 
to anything metalic nearby, but Miki sure did!

He grabbed Kozue and pulled her to the floor, even as Lum yelled 
&quot;YES.. WE... ARE!&quot; and then she threw a massive ball of lightning! 
Thankfully, there wasn&#39;t much in it&#39;s way other than a wall, which 
promptly exploded.

&quot;Then again,&quot; Kozue said very quietly as she got back to her feet and 
then dusted some of the plaster and wall materials off her school 
uniform, &quot;being engaged just might be negotiable.&quot; </pre>
