<h1>Soulmates (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/grain.html">Grain</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/soulmates-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>All right. Last chapter here. I realize now that this was probably way 
to short for this kind of story. But I had only intended to write a one 
shot in the first place, it&#39;s just that it grew too long and I had to 
split it up into four. Any way I hope you enjoy the conclusion of Soul 
Mates. 
 
 
 
When Samus got back late that night she found Nicole&#39;s armor on the 
floor in pieces, apparently she had been attempting to repair it. Nicole 
herself was asleep in the computer chair so she was all scrunched up and 
looked terribly uncomfortable. Samus nudged her awake.  
 
&quot;Huh... what... what is it?&quot; Nicole said groggily. 
 
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; 
 
&quot;What? What did... I do? You said use... use what I need... Did I do 
something wro--&quot; 
 
&quot;Why are you sleeping in that thing?&quot; 
 
&quot;I didn&#39;t... know where else--&quot; 
 
&quot;Sleep on the bed.&quot; 
 
&quot;Ugh... what... what about... you?&quot; Nicole muttered, still half asleep. 
 
&quot;Like it matters at this point... after what we did.&quot; 
 
&quot;Uh... ok...&quot; Nicole said as she stumbled out of the chair. 
 
Nicole had been sitting with her legs folded beneath her, so they had 
fallen asleep, and she fell when she tried to stand from the chair. 
Samus caught her in her arms before she went down. They were face to 
face once again; Samus gazed at her, then closed her eyes, and slowly 
moved to kiss her. But apparently she moved too slowly; Nicole was sound 
asleep on her shoulder now. Samus sighed then dragged Nicole over to the 
bed and laid her in it, then climbed in herself and went to sleep. 
 
Later that night Nicole awoke to find herself in the bed with Samus 
sleeping sprawled out next to her, and was a bit confused as to how she 
got there. She stared at Samus sleeping, listening to the sound of her 
breath, watching her lungs rise and fall; she got a soft expression on 
her face. She saw Samus&#39; hand outstretched on the bed, palm up, and 
decided to take it. That was how this all began, holding her hand... She 
smiled and drifted back to sleep again. 
 
Not too long after Samus awoke and attempted to roll on to her side but 
found her arm caught and discovered Nicole hanging onto her hand. She 
looked curiously at her. Nicole had such a soft and gentle looking face; 
one would hardly expect her to be the battle hardened soldier that she 
was. Samus slid up next to her and rolled onto her side like she had 
intended, though now pulling Nicole&#39;s arm around her in the process. 
 
------ 
 
For the following few months the two of them lived there together. For 
Nicole it was a time of change; she no longer was in the employ of the 
UNSC, she worked for herself now. Taking after Samus she took up bounty 
hunting for a living, once she had repaired her armor. She mostly just 
tracked down small time criminals on Kortalth. She spent her days 
looking for bounty heads in the police databases, which she accessed 
from Samus&#39; computer, attempting to get enough recognition to where she 
could get bigger jobs like Samus got so she could support herself, and 
eventually be able to leave and strike out on her own; as was their 
agreement when she first started staying here. 
 
For Samus however not much changed. She still didn&#39;t spend much time 
there, only now when she was home Nicole was there. Her favorite 
activity was still to mope about the house like usual, only now Nicole 
was there, and she didn&#39;t have to mope alone. She still showered right 
away when coming back from a long mission, only now sometimes Nicole was 
in there too. She still slept in her bed at odd hours, only now Nicole 
was there as well, the two of them engaging in the occasional lurid 
escapade, satisfying each others&#39; more base desires. Life was pretty 
much exactly the same for Samus, only now Nicole was there. 
 
One night, however, something was different. 
 
Nicole was laying in bed reading when she heard the front door open and 
close and then Samus came walking down the hall/kitchen. She had been 
away for a few weeks on a long job. Nicole sat up when she saw her and 
right away could sense something was wrong. It wasn&#39;t anything in 
particular, just minute changes in Samus&#39; body language. Samus glanced 
at her but their eyes never met. 
 
&quot;Uh... hey Nicky,&quot; she muttered out of habit then walked past her 
straight into the bathroom. 
 
&quot;Hey Sammy,&quot; Nicole said cautiously. 
 
They had taken to calling each other Sammy and Nicky at some point 
during the past few months, but neither was sure when or why it 
happened. Nicole sighed and laid back down as she heard Samus turn the 
shower on. Nicole thought about joining her in there; it had been a few 
weeks now and she had been getting restless and desired release. Though 
she decided against it based on Samus&#39; mood. Samus was always moody and 
brooding, it was just her nature, but this was different somehow. When 
she came out of the shower she walked over and sat on the edge of the 
bed and just stared blankly into space. 
 
Nicole slid up and hugged her from behind. &quot;Something wrong?&quot; 
 
Samus didn&#39;t answer though. She just turned to Nicole giving her an odd 
look, then pushed Nicole down to the bed, fell on top of her, and 
started with their usual routine. Neither of them were timid about 
physical intimacy any longer, however that night as they made love 
Nicole could again sense something was amiss. Samus just wasn&#39;t into it 
this time; her body was doing all the right things but it seemed like 
her mind was elsewhere. Nicole wanted to question her about it but she 
had no idea how. She had no experience talking about such things in the 
context of a relationship and was very insecure about even bringing the 
subject up. She wouldn&#39;t know how to ask or what to say once the 
conversation had been started. She thought it would be better to let 
Samus tell her on her own. 
 
----- 
 
Later that night Nicole awoke suddenly. She was usually up at this time 
anyway, so she wasn&#39;t really tired. She only went to sleep because Samus 
had been on a different cycle when she was away off planet. She looked 
over to Samus sleeping next to her. What had been bothering her? Nicole 
caressed Samus&#39; arm lightly then leaned over and kissed her softly 
before climbing out of bed, being careful not to wake her. She went over 
to the computer and flicked it on; the holographic screens appearing in 
the air in front of her. She logged on to the Galactic Federation 
Police&#39;s criminal database and began looking for potential bounty heads. 
She still had to actively search out work in this manner, as she hadn&#39;t 
made a name for herself yet as Samus had. 
 
Out of curiosity she opened Samus&#39; inbox. Fourteen job offers lined up 
and ready to accept, and most were from the government: Terrorist 
situation on Galvana III; Illegal arms traffickers in the Kapocii 
sector; Space Pirate activity near the galactic core; Prison transport 
ship taken over by escaped inmates; Protection duty for a biological 
research team on SR-388; the list went on and on. And the bids were 
astronomical; people were willing to pay a small fortune for her 
services. Nicole knew she could do all those things as well; it was just 
that no one was willing to pay a complete unknown like her for such big 
jobs. 
 
&quot;Hmm... I think I&#39;ll do that protection job next; sounds like easy 
money.&quot; Samus said from behind her. 
 
&quot;Oh! Sammy! I uh... sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to pry, I just...&quot; 
 
&quot;It&#39;s fine, I don&#39;t care.&quot; From her tone Nicole could tell that the 
something from earlier was still bothering her. Samus glanced at her 
screen then back to Nicole &quot;You know... I could recommend you. If you 
want to do stuff like that. They&#39;d probably listen to me.&quot; 
 
&quot;No... That&#39;s ok. I... I don&#39;t need help.&quot; 
 
Samus leaned over her and closed her inbox, revealing the search Nicole 
had been running before. &quot;We agreed... just... just until you get on 
your feet...&quot; Samus said with a sigh. 
 
&#39;Is that what this is about? I&#39;ve been here forever... her patience must 
really be wearing thin. You really want me gone?&#39; &quot;Sorry it&#39;s taken so 
long.&quot; 
 
&quot;How... how much longer do you think.?&quot; 
 
&#39;She&#39;s really irritated... I&#39;m such an idiot... How could I have thought 
that we...that she and I could be...uhh... we&#39;re just not those kinds of 
people. I knew this was a mistake.&#39; She sighed. &quot;I just need a week, 
maybe less.&quot; 
 
Samus sighed heavily then reached over and shut off the computer. 
 
&quot;Hey.&quot; 
 
&quot;Would it be so horrible if you stayed here? Do you really find me 
unpleasant to be around? Are you that anxious to leave?&quot; 
 
&quot;Sammy?&quot; Those comments were entirely unexpected from Samus. Nicole spun 
the chair around to face her as Samus knelt on the floor in front of 
her. 
 
&quot;I see you searching... every day searching on that computer... 
looking... for a way out. All the time you&#39;re looking for a way... to 
get away from me.&quot; 
 
&quot;No, Sammy, I--&quot; 
 
&quot;You have nowhere to go...&quot; Samus ranted on, talking over Nicole &quot;&#133;no 
military to take orders from, no obligations to fulfill, no family to go 
back to... You have no one... I... I have no one...&quot; 
 
&quot;Sammy, listen--&quot; 
 
&quot;I&#39;ve been alone my whole life...&quot; Samus continued on, &quot;I can live like 
that if I had to... but I&#39;m tired of being alone... I don&#39;t...&quot; She took 
Nicole&#39;s hands in hers. &quot;I don&#39;t want to live like that anymore. These 
last three months... they... they&#39;ve been...&quot; Samus trailed off, unsure 
how to put words to what she felt. 
 
Nicole still got her meaning though, she smiled and nodded. &quot;I know.&quot; 
 
&quot;See? You get me. You understand me, better than anyone... Better than 
anyone ever could... And,&quot; Samus slowed her speech and looked to the 
side, &quot;I... well I... I feel safe with you...&quot; 
 
&quot;Safe?&quot; Nicole found that last statement odd coming from someone like 
Samus. 
 
&quot;I... I want to be able to just relax, not be on edge all the time, and 
not worry... about what would happen if I let my guard down, about all 
the ...the bogeymen out there...&quot; She trailed off getting a bit quiet. 
&quot;I can feel that way when I&#39;m with you.&quot; 
 
&quot;Sammy... Samus, where&#39;s this all coming from?&quot; 
 
&quot;...I uh,&quot; she sighed. &quot;...I stare death in the face all the time. It&#39;s 
never fazed me once. But this last mission... I had a close call... and 
I... I got scared... I was afraid... afraid to die, for the first time I 
can remember...&quot; Her voice was very emotional. &quot;This time... this time I 
had something to lose; I had something... someone... to live for.&quot; There 
were tears in her eyes as she spoke. &quot;In that moment... the only 
thoughts in my mind were of you.&quot; She laid her head in Nicole&#39;s lap and 
put her arms around her waist. &quot;I... I can&#39;t lose you Nicky. I love 
you.&quot; She squeezed Nicole and took a deep wavering breath. &quot;...and 
that&#39;s not something I ever thought I&#39;d say ...to anyone ...so ...I 
don&#39;t say it lightly.&quot; 
 
Nicole put her hands on Samus&#39; shoulders, and spoke softly. &quot;We both 
said... right from the beginning, this was temporary... not to make more 
out of it than it was.&quot; Samus looked up, distraught at those words. 
&quot;But...&quot; Nicole continued. She smiled and ran her thumb over Samus&#39; 
cheek wiping her tears away. &quot;...things have changed since then. Things 
have changed... between us. We&#39;ve changed.&quot; Samus looked questioningly 
at her. Nicole slid off the chair and knelt with Samus. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I 
didn&#39;t make it clear to you before, I... I thought it was understood... 
I love you too. And I&#39;m not going anywhere, not if you don&#39;t want me 
to.&quot; 
 
Samus looked into her eyes. &quot;Promise?&quot; 
 
&quot;Yeah, I promise.&quot; Nicole said, pulling her into a hug. 
 
Samus let herself be enveloped by Nicole&#39;s warmth, curling up in her 
embrace. She&#39;d never felt this way before; trusting in someone else so 
completely and giving herself over to them; it was in total contrast to 
how she lived her entire life up to this point... and she was relishing 
it. Samus allowed herself to go completely limp, letting Nicole support 
her entirely, her physical state matching her emotional one. This caused 
Nicole to lose her balance and they slowly tipped over so they were 
lying on their sides on the floor. Nicole held Samus to her, kissing her 
cheek and neck over and over. 
 
&quot;You meant what you said earlier...&quot; Nicole said after a while. &quot;...that 
stuff about understanding you and feeling safe with me?&quot; 
 
&quot;Yes...&quot; 
 
&quot;Tell me again...tell me how you can be at ease and not worry... I... I 
liked that part.&quot; 
 
Samus smiled and hugged her tighter. &quot;I... I&#39;ve always been the strong 
one, the warrior, the protector... the one who is expected to be 
responsible for handling everything... always the one to carry that 
weight on her shoulders... it gets so heavy... I... don&#39;t want to be 
that person all the time.&quot; 
 
&quot;You don&#39;t have to.&quot; 
 
&quot;I want to feel safe and protected for once... I&#39;ve never had that... 
except when I&#39;m with you... you&#39;re the only one who&#39;s strong enough.&quot; 
 
Nicole stroked her hair. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re stronger than me,&quot; she 
said with a soft smile. 
 
&quot;That doesn&#39;t matter... you&#39;re the only one... you could face my demons 
without faltering. No one else could... I can rely on you.&quot; Samus 
suddenly became concerned at how that might have sounded. &quot;But I&#39;d never 
do that to you! I&#39;d never put that huge burden on you. I&#39;m just... I 
mean...It&#39;s nice to know you&#39;re there...that&#39;s all.&quot; 
 
Nicole smiled &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind if you did...&quot; Nicole said as she cupped 
Samus&#39; cheek in her hands and touched foreheads with her. &quot;If it was for 
you... I wouldn&#39;t mind at all. That&#39;s a battle I&#39;d gladly fight...&quot; 
 
Samus gazed at her in amazement as tears ran from her eyes. If it was 
possible she fell even more in love with Nicole. Samus kissed her 
tenderly then buried her face in her chest, crying softly, silently. 
 
&quot;Hey... what&#39;s wrong?&quot; 
 
&quot;Nothing&#39;s wrong.&quot; Samus shook her head &quot;...nothing at all.&quot; She looked 
up at Nicole smiling, then kissed and hugged her again and stayed that 
way for a long while.  
 
&quot;You hungry? Let&#39;s go out.&quot; Samus finally spoke after the long silence. 
 
&quot;This is new; you never want to go out.&quot; Nicole looked at her 
inquisitively &quot;And besides, it&#39;s the middle of the night, nothing&#39;s 
open.&quot; 
 
&quot;I know a place.&quot; 
 
&quot;Yeah?&quot; 
 
&quot;Yeah... in the city.&quot; 
 
Nicole nodded and smiled &quot;Ok, yeah... I&#39;d like that.&quot; 
 
----- 
 
They called for and air cab to take them into the city. They couldn&#39;t 
help but be a little affectionate with each other in the back seat of 
the cab, much to the distraction of the driver. Nicole noticed as they 
approached their destination that it was in one of the worst parts of 
town, known for its high crime rate. In fact she&#39;d collared many 
bounties in this very area. 
 
&quot;I take it this isn&#39;t one of the nicer restaurants around.&quot; 
 
&quot;I suppose not...&quot; Samus said coyly. 
 
They arrived and paid the driver then walked into the place. It was a 
dark and smoke filled bar at the end of a dead end street. &quot;Aren&#39;t there 
any better places than this we could have gone?&quot; Nicole questioned. 
 
&quot;Probably...&quot; 
 
&quot;Hmm&#133;&quot; Nicole mused. &#39;Something&#39;s up.&#39; 
 
They sat and ate at a table in the back of the bar. The food wasn&#39;t bad 
but wasn&#39;t particularly good either. Samus didn&#39;t say much the entire 
time, she just kept looking around the room like she was searching for 
something. When they left Samus looked to the sky then to Nicole and 
gave her an unusual half smile. 
 
&quot;It&#39;s a nice night, why don&#39;t we walk back?&quot; 
 
&quot;It&#39;s kind of far, you sure?&quot; Samus just nodded in response and started 
walking. By now Nicole was more than a bit curious at Samus&#39; odd 
behavior. 
 
As they walked, Samus lead the way and took a meandering path, instead 
of walking straight out of the city. Nicole was now dying to know what 
Samus was doing. She was going to say something but decided to just 
observe for now. Suddenly Samus started walking at a very brisk pace and 
crossed to the other side of the street getting a bit ahead of Nicole. 
 
&quot;Hey...&quot; Nicole called after her. She crossed the street as well and 
then noticed some people up ahead; three unsavory looking guys, 
basically street thugs. In fact Nicole had seen them around before; this 
was their turf. Definitely the criminal element, though they didn&#39;t have 
prices on their heads so she&#39;d left them alone in the past. But now 
Samus was walking right in the midst of them. 
 
As Samus approached they immediately took notice, chatted amongst 
themselves briefly, then the three of them stepped out to completely 
block the sidewalk. Samus tried to step around them but they wouldn&#39;t 
allow it, getting in her way again. 
 
&quot;Hey babe, where you going in such a hurry, stay and keep us company,&quot; 
they taunted her. 
 
Nicole at that point expected them to at best wind up in the hospital. 
They were going to get it now, she thought, they had no idea who they 
were harassing. But Samus didn&#39;t do anything to them, she just stood, 
looking down at her feet timidly. 
 
&quot;Hey what&#39;s wrong with you? You ignoring us? That&#39;s not very polite,&quot; 
the lead thug said then shoved her, once, then twice, pushing her back 
up against the wall. He put his hand on the wall just over her shoulder 
and leaned over her, blocking her escape. She just turned her head, 
refusing to make eye contact, and acting very docile. 
 
&#39;Hey, what the hell!&#39; Nicole glared as she caught up to them. What was 
she doing? 
 
&quot;Hey look, another one,&quot; one of the sidekick thugs commented on seeing 
Nicole. Their stupid grins widened thinking they&#39;d won the lottery. Two 
of the thugs turned their attention to Nicole. &quot;You want to join our 
party too?&quot; they said as they blocked her approached. 
 
Nicole ignored them, looking past to where Samus was. &#39;What&#39;s wrong, 
what&#39;s she doing?&#39; Samus raised her eyes to look only at Nicole with the 
most incredible sense of longing in them. &#39;What? ...what&#39;s that look 
supposed to mean?&#39; Though her bewilderment gave way to rage when the 
lead thug started touching Samus in inappropriate places. &quot;Hey!&quot; She 
shouted. &quot;Get your goddamn hands off my girl!&quot; Almost at the same time, 
she kicked the thug to her left in the knee cap, bending his leg the 
wrong way, and grabbed the one to her right by the arm and flipped him 
over her shoulder, dropping him on his head. 
 
&quot;What the...&quot; The lead thug turned to see his flunkies fallen to the 
ground. He pulled out a knife but Nicole was on him before he could get 
a solid grip on it and it was knocked from his hand. She kneed him in 
the groin, repayment for touching Samus, and as he went down she drove 
her elbow into his face, breaking his nose. 
 
&quot;Samus! What the hell? What were you thinking?&quot; 
 
Samus grabbed onto Nicole&#39;s arm and leaned against her, resting her head 
on her shoulder. &quot;You saved me... thank you.&quot; She said softly. 
 
Nicole sighed in frustration. &quot;Sammy, you idiot.&quot; She put her arm around 
Samus and pulled her close. &quot;Was that what this was about?&quot; 
 
Samus nodded. 
 
&quot;What&#39;s wrong, huh? You didn&#39;t believe me? That&#39;s what this whole night 
was for? You had to... put me to the test?&quot; 
 
&quot;NO! No, that&#39;s not... I... I just wanted... I wanted to be protected by 
you... I wanted to know what it felt like... just this once. Are... are 
you mad?&quot; 
 
&quot;No...&quot; Nicole shook her head &quot;No. It&#39;s ok... It was just kind of a dumb 
thing to do. What if you were hurt?&quot; 
 
&quot;I&#39;m Sorry. But... I knew you wouldn&#39;t let that happen. Besides I 
wouldn&#39;t let things get that far.&quot; Samus glanced back at the fallen 
ruffians. &quot;They&#39;re lucky you did step in, I wouldn&#39;t have been so gentle 
about it.&quot; 
 
Nicole sighed heavily and shook her head. &quot;You&#39;re something else you 
know that... Come on, let&#39;s just go home now.&quot; 
 
&quot;Home...&quot; Samus looked longingly at Nicole. &quot;Our home?&quot; 
 
&quot;Uh-... yeah...&quot; Nicole smiled. &quot;Yeah, our home.&quot; 
 
Samus sighed and closed her eyes, she clung to Nicole&#39;s arm as they 
started to walk off. 
 
&quot;You know... when you yelled at them to take their hands off me... and 
you called me your girl... well it... it felt really good.&quot; 
 
Nicole smiled. &quot;It felt nice saying it too.&quot; 
 
&quot;Mm... Nicky?&quot; 
 
&quot;Yeah?&quot; 
 
&quot;What do you want to do when we get home?&quot; 
 
&quot;Hmm...I can think of a few thi-- uh!&quot; 
 
The rapidly increasing high pitch squeal of a blaster charging up was 
the only warning they had; they both recognized the sound instantly. One 
of the thugs apparently was armed and was not too happy with the beating 
he received. Samus spun around placing herself in front of Nicole just 
as the shot rang out, striking her in the chest. 
 
&quot;Samus!&quot; Nicole called out horrified. 
 
Fortunately, from the moment she heard the gun charging she 
instinctively had begun materializing her armor. The bastard had just 
tried to shoot Nicole in the back, Samus wasn&#39;t about to let that slide. 
Her outstretched arm was already aimed at him as the cannon materialized 
over it. And when she fired, with a deathly cold stare, she was looking 
him square in the eye.
