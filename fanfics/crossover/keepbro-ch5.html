<h1>Keep Thy Brother Safe (part 5 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/keepbro-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Misty and Kari where at the park, not many people where there, yet 
they&#39;ve been there for the past four hours, people where still at work. 
Every one would be at home by the time they got back. They chatted for 
ages about what they would do once they left, travel the world, swim in 
the deepest lakes, climb the Himalayas, they could do anything they&#39;d 
ignore the comments that fall on to them: together they would be good 
mothers to Rosette. 

&quot;Any way&quot; Kari said her smile returned. &quot; What time is it?&quot; 

&quot;5 o&#39;clock&quot; Misty replied 

&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Kari replied hastily 

&quot; I think we should go back,&quot; Misty advised, &quot;before they worry about 
you&quot; 

&quot; I wish I could stay&quot; Kari moaned resting her head on Misty&#39;s chest 

&quot;Me too&quot; Misty whispered turning away discovering her ex-boyfriend Ash 
happily walking down the street with his partner May. This made Misty 
look at her girl friend. Is she doing the right thing? Are they being 
stupid? Or are they just trying to avoid their ex-boyfriends? Either way 
they where on the verge on leaving however they are still young if they 
where in Jetiendo it would have been simple because they have no age 
limits on the other hand Misty&#39;s family is far away whereas Kari has all 
her friends and family right here in Japan she had no descent reason to 
move. 

Misty&#39;s phone went, Misty picked it up and answered it 

&quot;Hello&quot; Misty replied. Her face suddenly came sad, shocked all at once 
&quot;I&#39;ll visit you&quot; Misty said hastily &quot;I&#39;ll get there as quickly as I can&quot; 
she hung up. Then looked at Kari &quot; change of plan&quot; Misty gasped, &quot; We 
gotta go now!&quot; 

Kari&#39;s face filled with happiness. &quot;Right now&quot; Kari asked 

&quot;Right now&quot; Misty gasped as she squashed Kari&#39;s hand and rushed rapidly 
not caring about the public&#39;s reaction. 

The two reached the airport at about 6:30, they looked at their tickets 
that was a week ahead, they got what they wanted to do but they where 
out of words, it would be disgraceful to open their mouths. They had 
together between them, they had 500$ and credit cards that Kari stole 
from her parents. To their luck out the glass walls was a building, 
looks in need of repair 

&quot;So what we&#39;re gonna do?&quot; Kari asked excitedly&nbsp;

&quot; We&#39;ve need somewhere to stay for a few days&quot; Misty replied 

&quot; I thought we where going tonight&quot; Kari muttered as she put her head 
down her neck. Misty uppered her lowered gutted face 

&quot;Kari&quot; Misty replied &quot;I don&#39;t wanna waste money on renewing the tickets 
so why don&#39;t we sleep in that youth hostel over there&quot; Misty pointed out 
of the window wall. 

&quot;Looks in need of repair&quot; Kari replied 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll accept full responsibility&quot; Misty mouthed kindly. 
Kari&#39;s face started to smile as Rosette waved her arms in a silly way. &quot; 
Anyway&quot; Misty continued, &quot;I don&#39;t want you to look like a tramp&quot; 

&quot; Me neither&quot; Kari replied as they kissed slowly and passionately until 
Rosette started to cry.
