&quot;Oh my, that rocket looks absolutly lovely!&quot; Bridgett Healy, dressed in her black maid&#39;s 
uniform, cheerfully gushed as she assessed the bunches of fresh arugula as it was presented 
at the greengrocer stand she visited. &quot;Sir Integra just adores fresh rocket in her salad!&quot; 
Looking up to the man, she added, &quot;I&#39;ll take two - no, three bunches!&quot;

The man, who was the owner of the greengrocer, replied, &quot;Right y&#39; are, love!&quot; He gathered-up 
the arugula and stuffed them in a plastic bag. After weighing the bunches, he then added 
them to the bill. &quot;Anythin&#39; else, m&#39; dear?&quot;

Bridgett gone over her grocery list, then looked at the scallions he had offered. &quot;Hmm... 
those spring onions look a little tired.&quot; Indeed some of them seemed to be showing some 
signs of becoming limp. &quot;Have you any fresher than this?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Not really, love,&quot; the greengrocer asked. &quot;I&#39;ll be getting&#39; in a new shipment tomorrow, if 
y&#39;re willing to wait.&quot;

Feeling a little discouraged, Bridgett weighed her options. &quot;Well... it&#39;s not like the cook 
is going to be serving them fresh; they&#39;ll be going into a cooked dish anyway... so I guess 
a bunch will do.&quot;

After getting the scallions, Bridgett gone over her list. Her shopping cart, which was at 
her feet, already had her orders from the butcher and dairy. &quot;Hmmm... let&#39;s see: rocket, 
spring onions, red onions, cos, iceberg, radishes, zucchini... as well as two aubergines for 
parmigiana tomorrow - yes, that&#39;s it!&quot; After being presented the bill and paying the man, 
Bridgett stuffed the produce into the cart and cheerfully started her way back to the 
Hellsing mansion.

It had been more than a year since that horrible evening - the one which Millennium and 
Iscariot almost undone London, and the young dhampir had to smile seeing the various 
construction cranes from sites rebuilding the city, as well as people returning to it and 
the jobs needed for them! London was slowly - but surely - coming back to life - which made 
Bridgett all the happier!

There was also another reason for Bridgett to be happy. Today was her 18th birthday, and to 
celebrate, Irene &#39;Rally&#39; Vincent had promised to take her out to one of her favorite 
hangouts outside the city. So with a spring in her step, the black-haired dhampir quickened 
her pace back to the bus stop to the mansion.

However, as she turned the corner, she sighed discouragily. The path between her and the bus 
stop back to the mansion unfortunately ran through one of the most disreputable streets in 
the city - filled with thugs and pushers that either survived the attack - or Rally, Seras 
Victoria and her supervisor - and up until today her legal guardian - Moria Hedgley&#39;s 
efforts to rid the city of them! Bridgett would prefer to avoid this street altogether and 
take another - but that street was still being rebuilt from the attack!

Deciding to take a chance, Bridgett decided to scope-out the street first, using the &#39;third 
eye&#39; that Rally had taught her. Imagining that on her forehead was another eye, her mauvine 
eyes glowed brightly as, from her perception, the shadows were parted. Sure enough, three of 
the thugs that usually taunted and sexually-harassed her were about - including one she 
recognized - talking amongst themselves. &quot;Just my luck,&quot; she sighed to herself, &quot;those 
bastards that always bothered me are there... as well as that bully Rodney, talking like 
nothing&#39;s wrong!&quot; Pausing briefly, she then added, &quot;Oh well... nothing ventured, nothing 
gained!&quot; Squaring her shoulders, she along with her purchases entered the foreboding street. 
Hoping against hope, she proceeded at a quick pace, ignoring the group and centering her 
gaze on the other end of the street.

No such luck! &quot;&#39;Ey there, beautiful?&quot;, one of them, a young man with dirty blonde hair 
called out, &quot;Why don&#39;t y&#39; stop by an&#39; talk to us?&quot;

&quot;No thank you!&quot; Bridgett indignantly replied, still walking and not bothering to look at 
them. &quot;I&#39;ve got a lot to do today and I would thank you not to bother me! Now shove off!&quot;

&quot;Oh I don&#39;t think so, Bridgett!&quot; a redhead with blue eyes said, walking in front of 
Bridgett. Immedietly, she recognized him as the boy from her old school that had regularly 
bothered her before the attack... and stopped as a result. &quot;I &#39;appen t&#39; know y&#39; from long 
ago, an&#39; I believe th&#39;t today y&#39;re 18 - which means th&#39;t y&#39;re now legal!&quot; Quickly, the three 
surrounded Bridgett, cutting-off any escape. &quot;So &#39;ow about it, babe - ready t&#39; put-out now?&quot;

&quot;Rodney,&quot; Bridgett countered, steely eyeing the red-haired boy, &quot;I have already have someone 
that is going to take me out to a nice dinner tonight to celebrate my birthday, and I do not 
want to disappoint that person! So if you do not want to get further embarrassed, then I 
suggest you and your &#39;friends&#39; push-off and let me through!&quot; In the meantime, she assessed 
her situation. &#39;I could easily overcome these &#39;loosely-referred&#39; gentlemen if I want - but 
if I use my full strength on them, they could end-up getting hurt - or worst killed!&#39; she 
thought. &#39;Which means putting into practice some to the moves Berttle back home had taught 
me... as well as a little advice Rally gave me!&#39;

&quot;Don&#39;t get shirty on me, y&#39; little bitch!&quot; Rodney growled, edging closer. &quot;Maybe I should 
slap those purple contacts of yours off t&#39; teach y&#39; a lesson!&quot; He then drew his hand and 
proceeded to strike - only to have Bridgett grabbing his arm and flipping him over her 
shoulder, where he landed hard, knocking the wind out of him!

&#39;Nice of Berttle to teach me that little thing!&#39; Bridgett smartly thought to herself, before 
dodging a fist from the blonde, then grabbing it and doing the same. Right about then, the 
third, a black-haired boy, grabbed her from behind. The blonde, recovering, then tried to 
punch her again. But this time, Bridgett quickly moved her head aside; the blonde connecting 
with his fellow - while Bridgett connected her heel into his crotch using a minimal amount 
of force. As the boy let go, she then clenched her fist and lightly struck the blonde 
between the ribs and stomach, making sure to pull-back a split-second after she did. Pausing 
briefly, the blonde felt like he was kicked hard in the solar plexus by a mule... and fell 
to the ground, groaning!

But during this battle, Rodney was able to recover from the initial attack - and drew a 
black snub-nosed revolver from which he hid in the belt behind his back. &quot;Y&#39; little bitch,&quot; 
he snarled as he took aim at Bridgett&#39;s head...

*BLAM (CLINK)!*

&quot;OWWWW!!!&quot; Rodney had shook his hand, the gun knocked out of his hand from the shot - which 
had a distinctive report! Turning to face his assailant, he further snarled, &quot;JUST WHAT THE 
FUCK...&quot; but stopped when he found a chromed gun barrel pressing firmly against his 
forehead, as well as hearing the hammer being cocked.

&quot;What were you going to say, you fucking little dipshit?&quot; a female voice smirked, causing 
Rodney to cringe. That voice belonged to a Chinese-featured woman with purplish-brown hair, 
brown eyes, and pointed a chromed Berretta with Thai markings on it - as well as the Jolly 
Roger of the pirate Calico Jack Rackham on the slide and grip. One of the few English 
markings on the slide was the words &#39;9 mm Sword Cutlass&#39;. She wore a tight black muscle 
shirt, twin holsters, blue denim jeans and a jacket of similar fabric with the Hellsing 
coat-of-arms on the left pocket.

Her face revealing a cruel smirk, the woman added, &quot;Y&#39;know... if I had things my way right 
now, I would be showing you the color of your fucking brains for that stunt you just pulled 
on the kid! However, since the boss lady would likely get pissy if I killed anyone without 
cause, I&#39;m going to give you a second chance and let you fuckers live!&quot; Relaxing her stance, 
she took her gun away from the boy&#39;s forehead. &quot;Now you bastards get out of here - before I 
have to disappoint my boss!&quot; Taking the hint, the three decided the better part of valor was 
to beat a hasty retreat to a nearby alley. Satisfied, the woman then holstered the gun into 
its empty receptacle.

Assured that her purchases - as well as her assailants - was uninjured, Bridgett turned to 
the woman and said, &quot;Now I don&#39;t think that was quite necessary, Revy! I could&#39;ve handled 
myself!&quot;

Revy didn&#39;t answer immedietly, instead picking up the gun Rodney had aimed at the young 
dhampir. &quot;I had to,&quot; she said. &quot;If he shot you with this, it would&#39;ve fucking blown your 
cover in this burg and then we&#39;d be all shit!&quot; Tossing the gun to Bridgett, she added, 
&quot;Besides, Rally placed me in charge of you while she&#39;s sleeping in the daytime - and for my 
health, I do not want to fucking piss her off, if you follow my drift!&quot;

Bridgett paused, studying the gun. &quot;To say the least!&quot; she breathed. &quot;I never believed 
Rodney was even capable of ever drawing a gun, no less actually taking aim!&quot;

Revy allowed the dhampir to ponder what may have happened for only a few seconds before 
saying, &quot;Hey, don&#39;t get too bummed about it, kid,&quot; patting her shoulder, &quot;let&#39;s get going 
before we miss the fucking bus!&quot; Nodding in agreement, Bridgett crushed the gun in one hand 
into an unrecognizable lump of wood and metal before discarding it and accompanying the 
mercenary to the stop.

OUTSIDE THE HELLSING MANSION...

The two had been dropped off one and a half kilometers away from the main entrance, allowing 
for them to indulge in casual conversation. &quot;So,&quot; Bridgett began, &quot;you made your weekly call 
to your friends in Roanapur?&quot; Revy nodded. &quot;How was it?&quot;

&quot;Same old shit as the last time I called,&quot; the pirate muttered, &quot;Dutch complaining about not 
having me there and all.&quot;

&quot;Even with the &#39;inconvenience fee&#39; Sir Integra generously gives the Lagoon Company every 
month?&quot; Bridgett offered.

All Revy did was shrug. &quot;I guess that&#39;s his way of saying that the gang misses me - at least 
for Dutch and Benny! I really don&#39;t know about Rock, though. I guess he doesn&#39;t miss me 
bitching at him for some reason or another.&quot;

&quot;Oh I&#39;m certain Rock misses you, Revy,&quot; Bridgett corrected, &quot;it&#39;s just the abuse he doesn&#39;t 
miss!&quot;

Both women chuckled at this. &quot;So, what are you going to do today, being this is your 
birthday?&quot; asked Revy.

Bridgett paused a beat. &quot;Well... after I take care of my duties for this afternoon, Rally 
said she was going to take me to her, Miss Hedgley and Seras&#39; favorite place - just me and 
her. She says the food there is excellent, which makes me wonder since all she has consumed 
is blood.&quot;

&quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Revy offered, &quot;just so long it&#39;s not another version of 
the Yellow Flag!&quot;

&quot;Oh she assures me that no fighting is allowed there whatsoever,&quot; the young dhampir said.

The two walking for a bit. &quot;I&#39;d like to know,&quot; Revy began, looking at Bridgett&#39;s cart, 
&quot;what&#39;s you get today?&quot;

Bridgett looked at her cart. &quot;A good roast from the butcher&#39;s, milk, eggs, and from the 
greengrocer&#39;s cos, iceberg, spring onions, red onions, rocket, radishes, zucchini and two 
aubergines for tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Aubergines?&quot; Revy asked curiously.

&quot;Why yes, these.&quot; Bridgett reached into the cart and pulled out a large, shiny purplish 
fruit from it and showed her.

&quot;Oh... eggplant! Well why the fuck didn&#39;t you say &#39;eggplant&#39; in the first place?&quot; asked 
Revy.

&quot;I did... just not in the way you&#39;re used to,&quot; Bridgett explained.

This only produced an impatient sigh from Revy, which was replaced by an excited look. 
&quot;Wow!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Does that mean the cook&#39;s going to be making that killer eggplant 
parmigiana that I like tomorrow?&quot; Bridgett just nodded. &quot;Alright! Sure beats all the shit I 
had to put-up with back in Roanapur!&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy,&quot; Bridgett observed as the two made their way to the front gate. 
&quot;Look, I have to get this to the kitchen. Nice of you walking me home, Revy.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Revy replied, seeing Bridgett sprint off with her purchases. &quot;In the meantime, 
I&#39;m going to have to report-in to the boss lady - to assure her I didn&#39;t fucking kill 
anybody!&quot; Both women laughed as they went their separate ways.

XXX

For the remainder of the afternoon, Bridgett cheerfully went about her duties - which mainly 
consisted of cleaning windows, dusting the floors and furniture and other objects in the 
recently-restored mansion. Occasionally, though, she found an object that needed cleaning 
that was too high for her to reach - namely the very tall bureau she was now contemplating 
on how to dust the top! She could try to find a stepladder - which would mean putting 
herself behind her schedule.

Succumbing to her impatience this time around, Bridgett first made sure nobody else in the 
staff was watching - then levitated until she reached the top. Then quickly running her 
cloth over the top, she finished her job before lowering herself down to the floor. &quot;Next 
time,&quot; she said quietly to herself, &quot;I&#39;m going to make sure the stepladder is out before 
even thinking of trying a stunt like this again!&quot;

&quot;A wise choice.&quot; Startled, the young girl turned around - and saw Sir Integra Fairbrook 
Wingates Hellsing standing behind her, smiling. &quot;I must admit, though, you did take care to 
make sure you were unobserved by the others beforehand.&quot;

&quot;Obviously not careful enough, if you saw me, Sir Integra,&quot; replied a very nervous Bridgett. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Sir Integra. I know I shouldn&#39;t be exhibiting my powers in such a way...&quot;

&quot;Calm yourself, Bridgett,&quot; the Hellsing leader interrupted. &quot;I realize that this is merely a 
practice of your abilities, so no harm done.&quot; Her smile continued as Sir Integra added, 
&quot;What I was going to tell you, though, is that I am giving you the night - as well as 
tomorrow off for your birthday.&quot;

For her part, the young dhampir looked surprised. &quot;The rest of the night... and tomorrow 
off!&quot;

&quot;Did I ask you to repeat yourself?&quot; Sir Integra questioned, a bit of an edge in her voice.

&quot;Oh... no, Sir Integra!&quot; replied Bridgett, embarrassed by her gaffe.

The Hellsing leader nodded. &quot;Good. Now I suggest you get yourself ready. Wouldn&#39;t want to 
disappoint Rally now, do we?&quot; A playful smile graced Sir Integra&#39;s features.

&quot;Y-yes, Sir Integra... and thank you!&quot; Feeling relieved about the whole episode, Bridgett 
gathered her supplies and headed off to the supply closet before making her way to her room 
on the second floor.

Of course, when she got there, she was surprised to see Moria, dressed in her butler&#39;s 
outfit, seemingly going over a small pile of clothing on the bed. &quot;Oh good, Bridgett, you&#39;re 
just in time,&quot; she cheerfully said.

&quot;Uh... uh Miss Hedgley,&quot; the young dhampir stammered, surprised, &quot;what exactly are you doing 
in my room... and what are you doing?&quot;

&quot;Oh please,&quot; Moria dismissed, still working on the clothing, &quot;I keep telling you that, while 
we&#39;re on duty it is all right to use titles. It&#39;s only after work is over where we get to be 
informal.&quot; She then looked-up and added, &quot;Although I&#39;m flattered that you still forget that 
little bit. As for why I&#39;m in your room and what I&#39;m doing, I&#39;m making sure you have the 
proper clothing for your date with Rally.&quot;

&quot;But Miss Hed... er, Moria,&quot; Bridgett continued, &quot;I had my clothes for tonight already 
set-out!&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; replied Moria, &quot;and frankly I was a little disappointed about the choice of 
clothes that you laid-out. You&#39;re going to a nightclub, not a church social, so I think it&#39;s 
important you look nice for Rally.&quot;

&quot;I... guess.&quot; Walking up to the bed, Bridgett was wide-eyed at the first piece her former 
guardian picked out - a lacy pair of black g-string thong panties! &quot;Y... you don&#39;t expect me 
to wear THIS!?!?&quot; she gasped.

Moria just looked at the girl as if nothing&#39;s wrong. &quot;They do look nice, do they?&quot; she said.

&quot;That&#39;s not the point!&quot; Bridgett pleaded. &quot;What would Rally think of me if I went into 
public wearing this... and... and THOSE!?!&quot; She pointed a trembling finger at the other 
articles of lingerie set-out - black thigh-high stockings and a lacy garter belt!

&quot;She would think you look beautiful, Bridgett,&quot; Moria smartly answered. &quot;Look, I know you&#39;re 
a little mortified about the whole thing right now, but it&#39;s not like every woman in 
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket is going to be gawking at you with this on! Besides, it was through there 
I found-out about this lovely fashion and lingerie shop in Tokyo - &#39;Silky Doll&#39; - and was 
able to get you all these... and this as well!&quot; She then held-out on a hanger a red 
mid-length dress with a plunging neckline.

Bridgett just stared in shock at the dress. &quot;You... you&#39;ve got to be joking!?!? With that 
neckline, my cleavage will be sticking-out like some cheap streetwalker!&quot;

&quot;Look, if you got it... don&#39;t be afraid to show it! To me, it shows that you&#39;re a true woman 
and not some bull butch dyke!&quot; Moira said as she handed the clothing to the girl. &quot;Now get 
behind the screen and put these on!&quot;

&quot;But there&#39;s no bra!&quot; Bridgett whined.

Moria just shoved the girl behind the dressing screen. &quot;You don&#39;t need it! Now stop wasting 
time and get dressed!&quot; Then as an afterthought, she added, &quot;Oh, and while you&#39;re at it... I 
suggest you don&#39;t put-on that thong until after you&#39;ve dressed in that garter belt and 
stockings!&quot;

&quot;But... but why?&quot; Bridgett asked, confused.

Moria just kissed her on the cheek and said, &quot;It&#39;s easier to take it off! Besides, many 
women... and men for that matter... find it arousing if their partner was just dressed in 
garter and stockings before they make love.&quot; She then patted Bridgett playfully and added, 
&quot;Now pop to it!&quot;

&quot;Y-yes.&quot;

A few minutes passed as Bridgett got out of her maid&#39;s uniform and into the clothes and 
undergarments Moria had selected for her, with Moria patiently seated on the bed. &quot;Uh... 
excuse me?&quot; Bridgett said, now dressed in the red dress as she emerged from the screen. &quot;Do 
you think you can zip me in the back?&quot; She turned around, the unzipped back showing.

&quot;No problem, dear.&quot; Getting up, Moria closed the back, then turned Bridgett around to get an 
assessment on how the dress fit. &quot;You look lovely,&quot; she said.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; replied Bridgett, then blushed as she added, &quot;although this thong I&#39;m wearing 
right now will take some time getting used to!&quot;

Smiling, the young woman replied, &quot;Don&#39;t give it a second thought. You know, Bridgett, you 
might consider letting your hair grow-out a little bit. I mean, that boyish look you&#39;re 
sporting right now is alright, but it doesn&#39;t look all that feminine. When was the last time 
you cut your hair?&quot;

&quot;Well... last year,&quot; Bridgett admitted, &quot;right before Rally... changed me.&quot;

&quot;Hmm... I see,&quot; Moria muttered, her index finger tapping her chin thoughtfully. &quot;I guess it 
would be a problem. Well nevermind about it, let me help you with your makeup.&quot; She then had 
Bridgett sit near the vanity and helped apply her makeup. &quot;I must say you don&#39;t really need 
that much, just enough to highlight the best parts.&quot; During Bridgett to the mirror, she 
asked, &quot;What do you think?&quot;

Bridgett smiled. &quot;Perfect! Thank you, Moria!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; the pretty butler replied as she handed a bottle of cologne to the girl. 
&quot;Now don&#39;t apply too much; just behind each ear... as well as a dab between your breasts.&quot; 
Bridgett didn&#39;t complain as she did so.

Just as the girl had clipped her earrings on and slipped into a matching pair of shoes: &#39;Hey 
Bridgett... are you ready? I&#39;ve got the car around the front!&#39;

&#39;I&#39;ll be right out, Rally!&#39; Bridgett mentally replied. Picking up her pocketbook, she headed 
for the door - but paused a bit. &quot;Moria - I would like to thank you for all your help this 
past year! I might not have gotten through it without you guiding me!&quot;

&quot;Actually, I should be the one thanking you,Bridgett.&quot; Moria then hugged the girl, adding, 
&quot;If it weren&#39;t for you - and your empathic talents - I might have been reduced to a mental 
wreak over my father and Uncle Reggie&#39;s deaths!&quot; A small tear rolled down her cheek, which 
was cleaned-up by Bridgett.

&quot;Well... I wasn&#39;t exactly thinking on my own at the time, but I do appreciate it.&quot;

&quot;Good. Now get going, Rally is waiting.&quot; Stepping out of the room, Moria and Bridgett 
walking out, with the younger girl heading down the stairs, with the elder watching in 
satisfaction.

&quot;AAAAAHHHHH!!!! FUCK, WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS DOING THAT, YOU BITCH!?!?&quot; Groaning, Moria decided 
to head for the source of the screaming. Sure enough, Revy was standing, trembling with gun 
drawn, while Seras stood a good ten feet away - smirking. &quot;YOU&#39;RE ALWAYS STEAKING-UP BEHIND 
ME AND SCARING THE FUCKING CRAP OUT OF ME!!!&quot; the pirate angrily bellowed.

&quot;But if I didn&#39;t,&quot; the No-Life Queen playfully said, &quot;then how will I make sure you&#39;re still 
on your toes?&quot;

Moria just shook her head. &#39;I swear, Seras is acting more and more like Alucard each and 
every day!&#39; Deciding to defuse the situation, she calmly walked over to Revy and gently 
pulled her gun down. &quot;You do realize if you shoot her, all you&#39;ll do is entertain her 
further,&quot; she said, giving Seras a disapproving glare.

&quot;Whatever!&quot; Revy snapped, pulling Moria&#39;s hand away and walking off. &quot;If it weren&#39;t for the 
money Sir Integra was paying me to put-up with this crap, I&#39;ve would&#39;ve left this fucking 
loony bin a long time ago!&quot;

Walking alongside Seras, Moria could only watch as Revy stormed downstairs, then turned to 
her and said, &quot;You&#39;re lucky I&#39;ve stopped her! You do realize her gun is loaded with blessed 
ammunition?&quot;

&quot;Of course I do,&quot; Seras smirked. &quot;I just wanted to see her restraint, that&#39;s all.&quot; She then 
giggled upon hearing Moria&#39;s annoyed groan, &quot;You know... since Rally won&#39;t be here tonight, 
it might be a good opportunity for us to have a good time.&quot; She then grinned further as she 
added, &quot;Or would you prefer to spend it with Revy... like the last time?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t remind me about that!&quot; the butler muttered. &quot;The only reason I ended-up in the sack 
with that bloody pirate is because the both of us had gotten roaring drunk that night!&quot;

&quot;But I didn&#39;t hear you complain about it too much, Moria,&quot; the No-Life Queen added.

For once, a thoughtful look came over Moria&#39;s face. &quot;You&#39;re right, Seras dear. It wasn&#39;t 
that bad.&quot;

ARISUGAWA&#39;S LOCKET, LATER THAT NIGHT...

The club was quite active that night, and &#39;Whirlwind&#39; Solude Schfoltzer had checked her 
weapons at the bar, ready for the night. It was quite fortunate that Mil and Maze had told 
her of this place, and had been a frequent patron since. She liked the food, the drinks were 
good and reasonably priced - and there were a lot of young girls there to whet her sexual 
appetites!

Of course, those appetites were a bone of contention for the club&#39;s owner, Juri Arisugawa, 
as she walked up to the bar. &quot;I hope you&#39;re not here to cause trouble again,&quot; she grumbled.

Solude looked shocked. &quot;Me? Cause trouble?&quot; she repeated, her short, spiky brown hair 
glinting. &quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous Juri, I&#39;m here for a good time!&quot;

&quot;So you say, Solude!&quot; Ryoko Hakubi countered, walking up to the two. &quot;For your information, 
Me and Minagi have had our fill of weepy-eyed young girls crying in their drinks because you 
broke their hearts!&quot;

&quot;Agreed, Ryoko,&quot; Juri added. &quot;You&#39;ve even made me in my bachelor days look good!&quot;

&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Solude half-heartedly apologized. &quot;It&#39;s not my fault that all the girls 
find me attractive.&quot; Then something caught her attention. &quot;Well what do we have here?&quot; Her 
sights were transfixed on a table - where Bridgett was sitting alone, as if waiting for 
someone.

Juri also noticed - and a sly smile came over her face as she glance at Ryoko - who was also 
smiling. &quot;See something interesting, Solude?&quot; she asked. Solude didn&#39;t answer, a lusty smile 
on her face as she made her way to the table.

By now, Minagi had noticed as well. &quot;Hey Sis,&quot; she whispered to Ryoko, &quot;aren&#39;t you going to 
warn her about that girl?&quot;

&quot;What for?&quot; Ryoko smirked. &quot;And miss the fireworks when Solude finds out?&quot;

&quot;Besides,&quot; Juri added still smiling, &quot;it&#39;s a perfect opportunity to see her get taken down a 
peg or two!&quot;

Minagi got the hint. &quot;Oh! Well then, this ought to be fun!&quot;

XXX

Bridgett had taken little notice of Solude&#39;s approach, her attention on the singers on the 
karaoke stage. &quot;Excuse me?&quot; the warrior said in a pleasant voice. &quot;I wonder if this seat&#39;s 
taken?&quot;

For a few seconds, Bridgett had taken an assessment of this newcomer. Although she didn&#39;t 
seem to be a threat, the dhampir could tell by her emotions that she had other matters in 
mind. That... and the way she noticed how Solude was eyeing her somewhat large breasts! &quot;Uh, 
not at this moment...&quot; she began.

&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll make myself at home!&quot; Solude interrupted, seating herself close to Bridgett. 
&quot;You know,&quot; she began, still making fleeting glances at the girl&#39;s bosom, &quot;I couldn&#39;t help 
but to notice your stunning eyes.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s strange,&quot; Bridgett said, glancing over Solude&#39;s left shoulder. &quot;From the looks of 
it, my eyes seem to be the least on your mind!&quot;

Solude blinked, surprised at how Bridgett noticed. &quot;Guilty as charged!&quot; she chuckled, 
oblivious to the figure walking-up behind her. &quot;Listen, I&#39;ve got some cash on hand, so why 
don&#39;t we head over to the upstairs rooms and get to know each other better?&quot;

Just about then, Solude felt someone tapping her left shoulder from behind. Not even 
bothering to look back, she hissed in a low voice, &quot;Go away... I&#39;m operating here!&quot;

&quot;I noticed!&quot; came the annoyed response.

&quot;ACCCKK!!!&quot; Suddenly finding herself sweating bullets, Solude had to force herself to look 
behind, much to a giggling Bridgett&#39;s delight. Sure enough, Rally was standing behind her, 
looking somewhat perturbed. &quot;R-R-Rally?&quot;

&quot;Hi, Solude!&quot; the dusky vampire replied, her voice&#39;s tone unchanged. &quot;Up to your usual 
tricks, I see... preying on young, vulnerable girls!&quot;

&quot;Uh... uh...&quot; Solude&#39;s face showed it all... embarrassment as well as blind panic! &quot;W-w-wait 
a minute...&quot; she stammered, suddenly pointing to Rally and Bridgett alternatively.

&quot;If you&#39;re wondering, yeah me, Master and Moria are still together!&quot; Rally then thumbed 
behind her and added, &quot;Why don&#39;t you do me a favor... make like an egg and beat it!&quot; 
Deciding not to hesitate, Solude teleported herself away to the table and back to the bar, 
where she shot Juri, Ryoko and Minagi dirty looks, the other three laughing behind their 
hands.

Taking Solude&#39;s place in the seat, Rally sat herself next to Bridgett. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I had to 
leave you back there to face that sexual predator,&quot; she began, &quot;but I had to call the 
mansion to make sure nothing is going to ruin this evening.&quot;

&quot;Well that&#39;s alright, Rally,&quot; Bridgett replied, patting the dusky vampire&#39;s hand. &quot;I already 
knew the motivations of that woman wasn&#39;t exactly to my benefit, if the way she was eyeing 
my chest was any indication.&quot;

Rally just chuckled. &quot;She tried to do the same thing to Moria the first time we took her 
here,&quot; she admitted. &quot;But at least she&#39;s a good fighter. When those S.H.I.E.L.D. bastards 
busted in over a year back, both Solude and Moria stood beside each other and fought them 
off! Gained a great deal of respect for her, Solude did.&quot;

&quot;Remarkable story,&quot; Bridgett said, picking up her water glass. &quot;And Rally, thank you for the 
dinner tonight.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Rally said. &quot;Well, the night&#39;s still young, so maybe we can do a little 
dancing before...&quot; she stopped when she noticed a shocked look on Bridgett&#39;s face. &quot;What&#39;s 
wrong? Is Solude back?&quot; Bridgett just shook her head as she pointed over the dusky vampire&#39;s 
shoulder. Alarmed, Rally quickly spun around - and a big smile broke from her face! &quot;Hey!&quot; 
she exclaimed.

&quot;Hey yourself, my friend!&quot; the human version of Rally, who was accompanied by Misty Brown, 
replied. &quot;I was wondering when I&#39;d run into you again!&quot;

&quot;Be lucky I didn&#39;t bring my gun!&quot; the vampire Rally laughed. &quot;For a minute I thought that 
Heinkel Wolfe might be sneaking up to cap me!&quot;

&quot;Uh... yeah. Look, Juri told me what had happened in your London,&quot; the human Rally said. 
&quot;From what I was told, the town was lucky to be still standing.&quot;

The vampire Rally just shrugged. &quot;Just Millennium and Iscariot&#39;s bad luck, I guess.&quot; Then 
she remembered about Bridgett. &quot;Oh, sorry, this is Bridgett Healy! She&#39;s eighteen today, so 
I&#39;d thought I&#39;d take her out!&quot; For her part, Bridgett just waived, still in a bit of a 
shock.

&quot;Oh? Anything happen between you and Seras?&quot; Misty asked, concerned.

The dusky vampire shook her head. &quot;No, nothing of the sort, Misty,&quot; she replied. &quot;In fact, 
between Master and Moria, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m a vampire or I would&#39;ve died from exhaustion!&quot; That 
got a laugh from the human Rally and Misty - as well as Bridgett, who finally came to her 
senses. &quot;So, what are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;Me and my Rally finally set a date for our wedding!&quot; Misty began. &quot;We were going to ask 
Juri if she could host the event and cater it.&quot; She then produced a quantity of sealed 
envelopes from the handbag she was carrying, &quot;as well as asking her to hand out invitations 
to those we know.&quot; She then fished through them and handed the vampire Rally one. &quot;Here&#39;s 
yours&#39; and Seras&#39;!&quot;

&quot;Thanks!&quot; the dusky vampire replied. &quot;Does that mean Moria and Bridgett are invited as 
well?&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; the human Rally remarked. &quot;As long as they&#39;re with you, it&#39;s fine by us!&quot;

&quot;Okay! Then we&#39;ll see you at the wedding!&quot; Rally then waived as her human counterpart and 
Misty left the table.

&quot;Rally... how...&quot; Bridgett began, finally finding her voice.

&quot;Oh them? I literally ran into them when this place first showed-up,&quot; Rally explained. 
&quot;Could&#39;ve gotten hairy, but Juri was able to smooth things over.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; Bridgett took another sip of water before saying further, &quot;Rally, if you don&#39;t 
mind... I think I would rather pass on the dance,&quot; she lustily gazed at Rally, her mauvine 
eyes meeting with the vampire&#39;s orange-red ones, &quot;and instead... explore the mysteries of 
the upper rooms Solude mentioned!&quot;

Rally grinned. &quot;I never thought you&#39;d ask!&quot; Holding up some keys, she added, &quot;Care to join 
me?&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot; Bridgett replied, almost breathlessly. And as one, both of them left the table 
and proceeded upstairs...

...While sitting at the bar, Solude watched - with tears flowing like waterfalls - at the 
whole spectacle! &quot;My night&#39;s ruined!&quot; she whimpered. &quot;How come that damn vampire gets all 
the blasted luck?&quot;

&quot;One wonders, Solude... one wonders!&quot; Juri replied, winking at Ryoko as she sat there with 
her glass of colored ginger ale!
