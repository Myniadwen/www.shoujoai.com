<a href="../crossover/jetiendo-ch34.html">Back to Part 34</a><pre>Kari and Misty stayed in the church, thinking about what damage they&#39;ve 
done around them,

&quot; Misty&quot; Kari stated &quot; I think you should tell Ash, about your 
pregnancy&quot;

&quot; I can&#39;t &quot; Misty replied, &quot; the baby&#39;s dead, we split up, and I don&#39;t 
need to tell him&quot;

&quot; I confessed for you,&quot; Kari begged &quot;now, you have to confess for me&quot;

&quot;How can I though?&quot; Misty asked &quot;I done it alone and I got through it, 
how can I tell Ash that I got pregnant with his kid and it died?&quot;

&quot; Pig?&quot; a voice behind her Ash and May, Ash&#39;s face stubborn as a bull

&quot;Ash&quot; Kari said trying to defend Misty &quot; she had a miscarriage, she 
wanted to tell someone so badly but you lot left, she got pregnant 
without herself noticing&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t waste your breath &quot; Ash groaned &quot; Misty had an abortion, if she 
intended on keeping it, she&#39;d have told somebody&quot; Ash and May left, 
Misty went after them.

Kari put her head down, I&#39;m a loser, I&#39;ve lost them both Kari fell with 
her head in her hands, Kari was discovered by Tasha, Tasha had her 
engagement finger armed with a diamond ring,

&quot;Kari&quot; Tasha whispered, &quot; I apologise for ease dropping, but don&#39;t be 
afraid, your family will be here&quot;

&quot; Tasha&quot; Kari pounded &quot;so innocent, sinless,&quot;

&quot; I have sinned too,&quot; Tasha announced

&quot; You&#39;re a catholic, the church has a thing against homosexuality&quot;

&quot; They do, but there is no reason to be ashamed of yourself, if you are 
bisexual, you&#39;re bisexual, you have a baby inside of you, your family 
and friends will still love you, God will love you because god is love&quot;

Tai, Matt and the distraught TK came over. Tasha stood up,

&quot;I&#39;ll leave you too it Kari&quot; Tasha smiled &quot; and remember God is love&quot;
