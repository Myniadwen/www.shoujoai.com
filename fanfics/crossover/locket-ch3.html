<a href="../crossover/locket-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;How did I meet them?&quot; Juri repeated the question, one of her elegant 
eyebrows raised slightly. They were closing up after a hectic day, 
clearing the tables and cleaning up. Juri tried to help, on the 
principle that misery shared causes less trouble.

May blushed a bit under Juri&#39;s gaze. The cyberdoll hesitantly 
continued, &quot;I guess I was just wondering how you met Ryouko and the 
others. It&#39;s obvious you&#39;ve known them all for a while.&quot;

Juri noticed Excel, Hyatt and Keiko all listening intently as well. 
She sighed, &quot;Back to work, and I&#39;ll tell, all right?&quot; She was greeted 
with eager nods. &quot;It all started after I graduated. I took a year off 
to travel across Japan, and ended up visiting a older gentleman I 
traded letters with at a very odd little shrine...



Juri walked rather wearily up the long flight of rough stone steps. 
She is dressed for travel, with a long coat, pants and her orange-gold 
hair tied back, all a bit dusty from the road, along with a large pack 
and a sword across her back. A fiercely beautiful woman, she looks 
wild and more than a bit dangerous. As she reaches the top she sees 
the gate, and the shrine beyond it. She looks around tiredly a moment, 
and is seen by a young man. He is a fair bit shorter than her, with 
short dark hair, white shirt and dark pants.

&quot;Hi,&quot; he said, offering his hand, &quot;I&#39;m Tenchi, are you here to visit 
the shrine?&quot;

Juri took his hand, answering &quot;Nice to meet you. I&#39;m Arisugawa Juri, 
and I&#39;m here to see your Grandfather about sword training.&quot; She 
noticed him looking at the sword strapped to her back, and smiled 
slightly. Making a small gesture to the sword, she said &quot;You&#39;d be 
surprised what you can get a license for if you try long enough.&quot; 
Tenchi laughed, and began to lead her over to the shrine.

&quot;So you&#39;re the one grandfather&#39;s been trading letters with! How did 
you talk him into training you ?&quot; Tenchi asked with a friendly smile.

&quot;He actually invited me. He mentioned he needed a sparing partner for 
his student, so once I finished school, I sent him a letter accepting 
his offer.&quot; Tenchi nodded with a slight smile. She smiled back, adding 
&quot;I take it you&#39;ll be my fellow student ?&quot;

Before Tenchi could answer her, happy cries of &quot;Tenchi!&quot; echoed down 
the path. He had a deer-in-the-headlights look on his face as two 
young woman suddenly came around the nearest building. One was dressed 
in a kimono style garment, that went well with her purple hair, while 
the other was in a form fitting bodysuit that was revealing cleavage, 
her hair a mix of different tones. Excellent survival instincts got 
Juri out of the way as the two latched onto Tenchi, talking pleasantly 
to him and snipping at each other.

Watching this, she heard a &quot;Myah!&quot; from below. She looked down, and 
saw a cute if odd-looking creature. It had the front of a cat, with 
large ears, cute face, and the front paws, but the rear end resembled 
a rabbit&#39;s, fluffy tail, big feet and all. &quot;Myah, myah!&quot; it repeated, 
looking at her entreatingly. She smiled a bit, and picked it up, even 
as the fight over Tenchi escalated in the background. The little 
creature nibbled the ends of her orange/gold hair, then mournfully 
&quot;myah&quot;ed softly.

&quot;Do you want something?&quot; Juri asked.

&quot;Myah!&quot; the creature affirmed.

Juri thought for a moment, looking at the sad little creature. She 
wasn&#39;t quite sure what it was, maybe she should just call it a cabbit? 
She thought quickly, running through orange foods in her mind. 
&quot;Oranges?&quot; The little cabbit looked sad. &quot;Carrots?&quot;

&quot;MYAH! Myah, myah, MYAH!&quot; The cabbit bounced in her arms happily as 
Juri laughed. She eased her backpack to the ground, keeping a grip on 
the happy cabbit, and fished out her bag of carrot slices. Being a bit 
tired from her walk, she sat down on the ground and fed the carrots to 
the cabbit, while watching the girls&#39; fight.

It was quite a sight, she had to admit The one girl with streaked hair 
was flying, energy sword swinging, as the other girl manipulated 
energy as a shield, and lashed out with electrical bursts. Tenchi 
noticed her watching, and carefully made his way to her side. Sitting 
down beside her, he said &quot;I suppose I couldn&#39;t convince you this was 
all an optical illusion?&quot;

She smiled slightly and answered &quot;Nope.&quot; He sighed mournfully, then 
fed the cabbit a slice of carrot .

&quot;I see you&#39;ve met Ryo-oh-ki.&quot; he said, gesturing to the little cabbit. 
&quot;If you have carrots, she&#39;s your best friend for life.&quot; They watched 
the fight go on for a few minutes. &quot;The woman with the sword is Ryoko, 
the purple haired girl is Ayeka. Once they calm down, I&#39;ll introduce 
you.&quot;

Juri chuckled, shaking her head. &quot;No hurry. Those two do this often?&quot; 
Tenchi nodded sadly. She clapped him on the shoulder as she said, &quot;You 
have my sympathies. I&#39;ve been in love triangles and they are NOT fun.&quot; 
A younger girl with long, blue hair came up the path, saw the 
escalating fight and shook her head mournfully. Making her way around 
as well, she sat down by Tenchi and Juri.

&quot;Juri, I&#39;d like you to meet Sasami. Sasami, this is Arisugawa Juri, 
here to train with Grandfather.&quot; Juri shook hands with the younger 
girl, and noticed the way she looked at Tenchi when he wasn&#39;t looking.

Not just a love triangle, she thought. &quot;Hi Sasami,&quot; she said, offering 
her hand. &quot;Just call me Juri, OK?&quot; The young girl nodded happily in 
reply. They talked for a few moments, Sasami asking about Juri&#39;s 
sword, her schooling, how long she would be staying, all with a young 
girl&#39;s honest enthusiasm. Eventually, Ryoko and Ayeka ran out of 
steam, and Tenchi and Sasami were able to separate the slightly 
smoking girls.

Then, the two noticed how long Tenchi and Juri had been talking, and 
their eyes lit up with pure, unadulterated jealousy. Juri saw the 
girls head for her with murder in their eyes and quickly gets up and 
makes a &quot;T&quot; sign with her hands even as she cried, &quot;Whoa, time out!&quot; 
The two girls come to a stop, surprised. Juri gave them her patented 
Ice Queen look as she said &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I just finished a very long day 
getting here, I am very tired, and I just want to go see Tenchi&#39;s 
Grandfather, then find someplace I can lie down and die in, O.K.?&quot; She 
looks tired all of a sudden, weary from her trip. &quot;If you two want to 
tear into me, could we maybe save it for tomorrow?&quot;

Sasami frowned disapprovingly at Ayeka, muttering under her breath. 
Ayeka looked a bit embarrassed, and the group helped Juri with her 
stuff as they headed for the main shrine. She had a quick &quot;Hello, how 
are you, I&#39;d love to stay, etc., etc.&quot; conversation with the impishly 
smiling older man, who asked her to call him &quot;Grandfather&quot; and ordered 
her to be housed in the Masaki home, which did not thrill the two 
ladies at all.

&quot;You&#39;ll have to share a room, I&#39;m afraid.&quot; Tenchi said as he led her 
to one of the upper floors of the house. The building itself seemed 
kind off odd to her, as it seemed to be a medium sized dwelling from 
the outside but had at least three floors from the inside, maybe more. 
Tenchi noticed her odd expression and smiled slightly.

&quot;I&#39;ll try to show you around and introduce you to the others tomorrow, 
but for now I&#39;ll just introduce you to your temporary room- mates,&quot; 
Tenchi said. He pushed open the upper floor room after knocking, and 
receiving a greeting. It was mildly messy, with two mats made up as 
beds on the floor. Two young women stopped talking, and waved happily 
to Tenchi and looked with curiously at Juri. Tenchi introduced Kiyone 
and Mihoshi, and Juri settled down for a rest.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Kiyone said, as she showed Juri around the house, &quot;it really is 
bigger inside than outside, thanks to our resident scientific genius.&quot; 
She knocked on the closet door under the stairs, and they heard a 
shouted &quot;Come in!&quot;

The door opened into a massive space, with darkness stretching into 
the distance. A short distance in, they saw a massive laboratory, and 
a childlike figure working at one of the benches. She looked, 
physically, about the same age as Sasami, but somehow seemed much 
older. She watches them approach, types into her floating keyboard, 
then nods decisively.

&quot;Juri,&quot; Kiyone said with a smile, &quot;this is Washu, a good friend of 
Tenchi and a super genius. Washu, this is Juri...&quot; Washu cut her off 
with a gesture, circling Juri thoughtfully.

She smiles sweetly, causing Kiyone to quickly back away, and says &quot;Hi, 
I&#39;m Washu, and you&#39;re interesting! How would you like to participate 
in my experiments ?&quot; Without waiting for an answer, she grabs Juri, 
pulls her over to large banks of equipment and straps her to a chair!

Juri, firmly strapped to the chair, various electrical connections 
stuck to her all over, sweatdrops as she smiled slightly and remarks, 
&quot;Up till now, I&#39;ve always been the strangest one in any group I&#39;ve 
been in.&quot; She looks thoughtful before adding, &quot;But I don&#39;t hold a 
candle to all of you...&quot;



May chuckled softly. Juri smiled, &quot;I stayed there for a few months, 
training and getting to know them all.&quot;

Excel finished with her tables with a cheery smile, &quot;So when you 
started this place up, you thought of them?&quot;

&quot;I noticed something was going on with Ayeka and Ryouko,&quot; Juri 
shrugged, &quot;and once Sasami introduced me to Minagi.&quot; She shrugged, 
remembering the young girl&#39;s idolization of the older girl.

&quot;So why did you leave the shrine?&quot; May asked curiously.

Juri noticed the lateness of the hour and smiled slightly. &quot;I&#39;ll tell 
you another time,&quot; she said. &quot;We all need to rest up for tomorrow 
night.&quot;

&quot;And what are we going to do tomorrow night?&quot; May smiled, giving the 
straight line.

&quot;The same thing we do every night,&quot; Excel chimed in, then all 
together, &quot;Try to take over the world!&quot;

The young women broke up laughing, and Juri sighed.
