<a href="../crossover/shadowcat-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>      &quot;Sir?&quot; Wendy tentatively asked as she entered the
office, the little blonde haired woman looking around
curiously.

      &quot;Here,&quot; Joker&#39;s voice rang out, and Wendy realized he
was hidden at his desk, concealed behind books and
various pieces of paper.

      &quot;A new field report from Kitty and the others,&quot; Wendy
reported excitedly, &quot;they&#39;ve encountered two new
Ijin.&quot;

      Joker stood up, gazing at her intensely, &quot;Who are
they?&quot;

      &quot;Amelia Earheart,&quot; Wendy read, &quot;the famous lost
pilot. She&#39;s apparently been augmented with biological
wings.&quot;

      &quot;And the other?&quot; Joker frowned.

      &quot;Yukio,&quot; she checked her notes before Wendy
continued, &quot;a martial artist who apparently has been
changed into a cat-woman.&quot;

      &quot;Interesting,&quot; Joker murmured, &quot;it seems to fit the
trend I&#39;ve noticed with the Ijin.&quot;

      &quot;Huh?&quot; Wendy blinked.

      &quot;It seems he may have borrowed more than our Ms.
Pryde&#39;s DNA,&quot; Joker mused, &quot;the powers he gave Gennai
Hiraga resemble the criminal Electro&#39;s, Amelia&#39;s wings
may well be borrowed from the X-Man Archangel and so
on.&quot;

      &quot;Does that mean we&#39;ll end up facing even more
superhuman Ijin?&quot; Wendy had to ask.

      Joker smiled grimly, &quot;I suspect so.&quot;

      In another part of Tokyo the three figures stepped
out of the black limo, Drake leading the way as he
looked around warily. &quot;Is this sort of thing really
necessary?&quot; the tall blonde haired man asked, tugging
at his tailored suit.

      &quot;If we want to be taken seriously, yes,&quot; Kitty
answered, the brown haired young woman dressed in
woman&#39;s business wear.

      &quot;But why am I dressed like this?&quot; Yomiko asked, her
red dress tight and slinky. She pushed her hair back
then adjusted her glasses nervously.

      &quot;You&#39;re my companion,&quot; Kitty explained a bit
sheepishly, &quot;so you need to look the part.&quot;

      &quot;So this Silver Samurai, he&#39;s...&quot; Yomiko asked.

      Surprisingly, Drake spoke up, &quot;Kenuichio Harada, the
bastard son of the former head of the clan Yashida,
Shingen Harada.&quot; He paused, &quot;Not a nice guy, I
understand.&quot;

      &quot;But he is an honorable one,&quot; Kitty added, &quot;he&#39;s
studied Bushido and the way of the samurai all his
life.&quot; She smiled wryly, &quot;But he&#39;s also running a
crime family.&quot;

      &quot;So why would he help us?&quot; Yomiko asked.

      &quot;He owes a debt to a friend of mine,&quot; Kitty answered
simply.

      The three headed towards the buildings, each feeling
the unseen eyes resting on them. &quot;This place has some
high security,&quot; Drake softly murmured as they passed
through the outer gates of the ancestral Yashida
castle.

      &quot;The Yashida&#39;s were once very big in organized crime
under Lord Shingen,&quot; Kitty quietly replied as they
moved down a stone walkway through a garden, &quot;and his
heir has strengthened those ties considerably.&quot;

      &quot;Didn&#39;t Mariko Yashida try to break those ties?&quot;
Drake recalled.

      &quot;And was killed by the Hand for the attempt,&quot; Kitty
said bleakly.

      The room they were led into was large, the Silver
Samurai waiting for them on the mats by a tea set. A
young woman dressed in traditional kimono prepared the
tea before smoothly rising, leaving them with the
intense looking older man. Divested of his mask and
armor Kenuichio Harada still had a powerful presence,
almost an aura of dangerousness about him, black hair
neatly styled and muscular body under traditional
robes.

      &quot;Welcome,&quot; Harada nodded respectfully, &quot;I was most
surprised to have you request a meeting, Pryde-san.&quot;

      Kitty folded her legs under her smoothly as she
knelt, noting that Drake and Yomiko both sat slightly
behind her, the blonde haired man looking like the
perfect bodyguard. &#39;I&#39;m glad Yomiko isn&#39;t pulling a
book out,&#39; she thought. Looking at Harada she said,
&quot;Thank you for seeing me so promptly.&quot;

      Harada just nodded slightly, &quot;A guest is always
welcome.&quot;

      &#39;He&#39;s not going to ask me why I came, even though his
curiosity must be killing him,&#39; Kitty thought. &quot;I&#39;m
sorry that a matter of some urgency has brought me
here,&quot; Kitty started, &quot;one that relates to your
father&#39;s former business.&quot;

      &quot;Indeed,&quot; Harada smiled slightly. They both knew that
he was carrying on the family business, but neither
would state it directly. &quot;How can I help?&quot; he asked.

      &quot;There is a certain figure in the underworld,&quot; Kitty
started, &quot;an assassin named &#39;Ogun....&quot;

      &quot;He is dead, is he not?&quot; Harada&#39;s eyes narrowed
slightly as he added coldly, &quot;Slain by Wolverine, I
understand.&quot;

      &quot;Apparently being dead hasn&#39;t stopped him,&quot; Kitty
explained.

      &quot;There were stories &#39;Ogun was a demon,&quot; Harada looked
at Kitty thoughtfully, &quot;is there really some truth to
that?&quot;

      &quot;He doesn&#39;t seem to want to rest easy in his grave,&quot;
Kitty answered. Leaving out certain details like the
Library&#39;s role she roughly sketched in the information
on the Ijin appearances and how they seemed to relate
to &#39;Ogun&#39;s return.

      &quot;Hmm,&quot; Harada sat there for a moment, studying the
three of them thoughtfully. &quot;I don&#39;t know much,&quot; he
finally admitted, &quot;but I can tell you some things.
First, whomever is creating these Ijin must be using a
very sophisticated lab, and therefore must have
purchased some very rare equipment just to keep it
operating.&quot;

      &quot;We&#39;ve already attempted to track such equipment
sales,&quot; Kitty answered him calmly, &quot;but so far, no
dice.&quot;

      &quot;I have certain contacts you likely don&#39;t,&quot; Harada
said dryly. He paused, &quot;There were certain rumors that
circulated after the first Ijin appearance, that a
powerful foreign organization had in truth been
responsible for their creation.&quot;

      Kitty leaned forward slightly, &quot;Do you know the
identity of this organization?&quot;

      &quot;Not precisely,&quot; Harada confessed, &quot;but the general
belief was they were British.&quot;

      Kitty felt a moment of shock, but kept it from
showing on her face. &quot;If you could contact me if you
find out anything,&quot; she half bowed, &quot;I&#39;d be deeply
appreciative.&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;ll contact you,&quot; Harada&#39;s servant took a copy of
Kitty&#39;s cellphone number even as he continued, &quot;please
let your mentor know I sent my regards.&quot;

      &quot;Of course,&quot; Kitty bowed again, then the three left
the buildings to return to the limo.

      &quot;I know what you&#39;re thinking, Kitty-san,&quot; Yomiko
spoke up once they got under way, &quot;and it&#39;s just not
possible.&quot;

      Kitty had a frown on her face, &quot;Oh? It fits a lot of
the information we have so far. The Ijin started out
as a British Library project before being taken over
by Sinister and &#39;Ogun, then twisted to fit their own
purposes.&quot;

      &quot;Even Joker wouldn&#39;t pull something like that,&quot; Drake
protested.

      &quot;I haven&#39;t known Joker long,&quot; Kitty answered him
coldly, &quot;but I could see him doing what he had to, if
it was absolutely necessary.&quot;

      &quot;Kitty...&quot; Yomiko started.

      &quot;Harada is a yakuza,&quot; Drake said with a scowl, &quot;a
known criminal. Are you really going to believe
anything he says?&quot;

      Kitty held up a hand, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m not
going to do anything without solid proof, all this
information means is that I&#39;ll be a lot more careful
around Joker and Mr. Gentleman.&quot;

      &quot;And us?&quot; Yomiko asked softly.

      Kitty met those eyes behind the glasses, eyes that
she knew she could trust. She gave both of them a
smile, &quot;I trust you.&quot;</pre>
