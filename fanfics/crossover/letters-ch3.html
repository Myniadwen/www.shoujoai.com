Miyagami Academy Maximum Authority Wielding Best Student Council

Dear Kuon

Thank you for your advice of developing a intelligence network around 
Fuka Academy. While I&#146;m somewhat experienced in gathering data on my 
own, I&#146;m somewhat less adept at leading others in such operations. Your 
suggestion of tapping into the school&#146;s gossip network was especially 
appreciated, and I already have a operative in mind. In fact, she 
apparently already knows you... Chie Harada.

I was rather impressed by the biographies of the Fuka Council you 
provided to your student council president, they were very thorough. 
Shizuru seemed quite surprised when you revealed she was a part timer in 
a lingerie store, and I thought Natsuki was going to die when you 
brought up her fluffy toy and lingerie fetish.

And why was Nanaho Kinjo blushing too? That and your own President 
Kanade&#146;s smirk had me wondering about the two of them. Is there now a 
rule that female student council presidents must be lechers? Or 
lesbians? I really must look into some other local schools and see if 
the trend continues....

Thank you also for the informative photos. Frankly, I really rather 
would not have known what Mai Tokiha and Mikoto Minagi are doing in 
their spare time, but they certainly were educational. The photos you 
provided of Mashiro Kazahana and Fumi Himeno have apparently guarenteed 
the funding of my intelligence service, in exchange for turning them 
over to Mashiro and not mentioning them ever again.

As you&#146;re no doubt aware, you seem to be a much more worldly person than 
myself, and I was hoping for some advice. There is a certain someone 
I&#146;ve known quite a long time, but because of our long friendship she 
doesn&#146;t notice I&#146;m interested in our being more than friends. How do I 
get my interest across to her, especially considering her focus on a 
school rival? Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Yours respectfully,

Yukino Kikukawa

Fuka Academy School Council
