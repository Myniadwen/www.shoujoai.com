<h1>Mai Kisaki (part 16 of 22)</h1>

Tomoe&#39;s footsteps echoed in the empty halls that led to and from the 
Emulator room. Her stay inside that apparently sacred place came to a 
swift end when Mai had gone. The only souls allowed into that chamber 
were those belonging to Natsuki and Shizuru. For every other member of 
Dammerung, it was forbidden. She herself walked a fine line between 
death and security. Natsuki was always one step away from cutting her 
down, but she was considered useful and was thus spared. Why kill 
someone who could make an effective meatshield or foot soldier? Perhaps 
Shizuru had something to do it. She had gotten Natsuki to spare Ann, so 
why not Tomoe? The onee-sama always looked out for her younger peers, 
didn&#39;t she?

And Ann! What a sudden dismissal! It was mind bending how fast things 
were happening. Shizuru was with the Otome. Shizuru was with the HiME. 
Shizuru was with the Otome again. It really didn&#39;t matter what side of 
the conflict Tomoe found herself on. All that really mattered was 
staying at Shizuru&#39;s side. Lord knew that she needed some stable 
presence with all the chaos that was occurring. She saw a dead look in 
Shizuru&#39;s eyes that had never been there before &#150; not even during her 
imprisonment. It frightened Tomoe how Shizuru had gone from the 
Headmistress&#39; equal to the Headmistress&#39; bitch in a matter of moments.

It wasn&#39;t often that Tomoe was allowed to even speak to her onee-sama, 
which was a matter of great distress given how Shizuru looked like she 
was searching something, anything, to hold on to in her moments of 
despair. Something was very, very wrong and the Shinso-like woman in the 
Emulator had something to do with it. So, when everyone had settled in 
for the night, save for the Dammerung soldiers who maintained a line 
against the still raging Orphan hordes, Tomoe made her move.

She briskly walked down the hall towards Shizuru&#39;s quarters, as she had 
memorized the exact location of such a room the instant she discovered 
where it was. Upon reaching it, no guards in her way, she knocked on the 
door. &quot;Shizuru onee-sama?&quot;

No answer. She knocked again, a bit louder. Still nothing. Gently, Tomoe 
grabbed the handle and opened the door. Everything was shadow. She 
peered in, but could not make out the details of the room. Fumbling for 
the light switch, she eventually illuminated everything. It was very 
spartan. Only items necessary for basic sleep and recovery were present. 
Shizuru was not there. The green haired aristocrat sighed in 
frustration. Now where had she gone?

Oh.

She shut her eyes tightly to block out the mental images. Still, some 
morbid curiosity got the better of her. With a slight tremble she 
proceeded further down the hall, heading for a pair of doors that would 
have led into the base commander&#39;s room. &#39;Ashura&#39; had long since been 
scratched out. It was Natsuki&#39;s suite now. Tomoe held her breath as she 
approached the final distance, and shut her eyes again as her worst 
fears were confirmed.

All Tomoe could hear was lustful groaning and screaming. None of it was 
from Shizuru, who kept dead silent throughout. Her fists clenched and 
tears threatened to break through, but she held them back with 
incredibly strong will. What was so special about that damned Natsuki, 
anyway? She bit down on her lip to stop an outburst of rage, nearly 
breaking the skin. Damn it.

- - -

She who was not Natsuki had a firm, possessive hold on the sweat laden 
figure next to her, crimson sheets barely curled around both their 
bodies. Shizuru, of course, had not given her the satisfaction of making 
any noise whatsoever. No indication that pleasure had been a result of 
strategic ministrations. The Obsidian Lord knew that his little slave 
had climaxed, but there was not even a whimper involved with it. No 
meeting of the eyes. Shizuru had been completely and utterly disengaged, 
even when forced to return the favors.

How pathetically stubborn and rebellious. It didn&#39;t really matter. All 
it proved was that despite it all, Shizuru was most definitely a proper 
pawn to be used as necessary. Submissive and obedient. Just what was 
required. The Obsidian Lord forced Natsuki to run her tongue along 
Shizuru&#39;s neck, and a filthy smirk followed when Shizuru flinched and 
turned her head away. And yet she endured it all. It wasn&#39;t Natsuki, it 
was Natsuki... everything was the same but horribly different at the 
same time. The poor girl felt violated and alone, didn&#39;t she? The 
Obsidian Lord nearly chuckled, and then felt like playing a bit of a 
game.

Shizuru watched as yellow eyes closed, and a small tremor ran through 
Natsuki&#39;s body. When the eyes slowly opened once more, they were a 
brilliant green. Everything was still for a moment, Shizuru&#39;s heart 
beating faster and faster as hope filled her. Had Natsuki taken control 
over the Obsidian Lord? Natsuki released a shaky breath and Shizuru felt 
fingertips just barely brush against her stomach with a great degree of 
hesitance. Too timid. Too fearful. This was not the Obsidian Lord.

&quot;S-Shizuru,&quot; Natsuki, the real Natsuki, stammered. As Natsuki&#39;s world 
became more lucid, all the information and memories running back into 
her head, her chest tightened. When she realized just what position she 
was in, and what the Obsidian Lord had surely done to Shizuru, an 
emotional dam broke. Tears fell against Shizuru&#39;s bare chest and Natsuki 
sobbed just once. In the next moment, Natsuki drew the other woman close 
and buried her face into her neck. Guilt and rage and sorrow overwhelmed 
her at the same time. &quot;Shizuru, Shizuru...&quot;

The name became a mantra, repeating and repeating in some childlike plea 
as tears continued to spill from emerald orbs. Shizuru wrapped her arms 
around a body that now, finally, felt warm and familiar. Both clung to 
each other for countless moments, Natsuki&#39;s mantra slowly warping into, 
&#39;Alyssa, Alyssa.&#39; Shizuru&#39;s hands ran through Natsuki&#39;s slightly damp 
locks, and she planted kissed on her forehead while whispering soothing 
words to try and calm the biker down.

&quot;Shh,&quot; Shizuru began. &quot;I will make sure that Alyssa lives.&quot;

Nails dug into her side. Rage became the dominant emotion. There was a 
growl and a hiss to Natsuki&#39;s voice. &quot;What did that thing do to you?&quot;

&quot;Ara, Natsuki should not worry about such matters.&quot; Shizuru gave her a 
chaste kiss on the cheek.

&quot;But it isn&#39;t me, it&#39;s that thing!&quot; Nails began to dig deeper as a roar 
of anger was repressed.

A gentle, enigmatic smile. &quot;I can bare it. Please, do not worry.&quot;

&quot;Shizuru...&quot; A hand brushed hair out of her face before trailing down 
the side of Shizuru&#39;s face. &quot;You&#39;re so kind. Putting up with such 
actions just for my sake... it&#39;s so noble. And loving. And caring. And 
so damn sickening and depressing that I just want to break your damn 
soul to see how much energy I can take from you!&quot;

Green eyes snapped open to yellow once again as the Obsidian Lord 
snatched away the bait that had been dangled in front of the Ikusahime. 
Shizuru found herself once again pinned, quite roughly, by the 
aggressor. Dark hair lowered like a curtain as the Obsidian Lord loomed 
over her. Shizuru forced herself to remain calm. Emotional distress was 
this thing&#39;s source of power. She wouldn&#39;t allow anything to show. Her 
jaw remained tensely closed as that which was not truly Natsuki stared 
down at her with those alien eyes.

&quot;If you truly want to make good on your promise about Alyssa, then 
you&#39;ll have to defeat the other Ikusahime before the Star draws near, or 
else it will be too late. And you know... perhaps there&#39;s a way to 
extract her alive and well that I haven&#39;t told you about,&quot; The Obsidian 
Lord teased. Shizuru stared back with eyes that once again displayed an 
inner sense of defeat. &quot;Ah, yes, that got your attention, didn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Do not tease in such a way.&quot;

&quot;I do not,&quot; the other female said. &quot;I speak the truth. And that truth 
will not be made into reality if the other Ikusahime kill her before you 
can slay them. It&#39;s imperative that you strike first, to hinder their 
progress. They&#39;re going to try and work as a team. You need to ensure 
that they are pitted against one another as soon as possible.&quot;

The first mission begins, then?

&quot;Miyu will, fortunately or unfortunately depending on your view, not 
leave the Thirteenth&#39;s side. You must do this alone, and I&#39;m sure that 
you can handle such a meager task. When dawn breaks, I want you out of 
here and hunting. Do you understand?&quot; No response. The Obsidian Lord 
grabbed her roughly by the neck. &quot;Do not even begin to try to withstand 
me again. You&#39;ve learned your lesson from that. You know that if you do 
not follow my orders, Alyssa will die. All thanks to your unwillingness 
to fight. They&#39;re all going to conspire to kill you anyway, after what 
happened. Everyone is on the line. Alyssa, Natsuki, you... the whole 
happy family. You have no choice. So accept your fate.&quot;

Shizuru was released and she swallowed what moisture had collected in 
her mouth. So it was. &quot;I accept.&quot;

With feminine grace, Natsuki&#39;s body slithered down Shizuru&#39;s side, lips 
planting kisses along her side, hip and thigh. Shizuru shut her eyes and 
pretended that it truly was Natsuki performing such actions, but 
everything was different. Too different to allow the fantasy to be at 
all realistic. Shizuru shuddered, but it was not because of pleasant 
sensations. After some time, the Obsidian Lord stood from the bed, 
Natsuki&#39;s trim and naked body shown off in the dim lighting. Clothing 
was pulled back on and it looked as if the Obsidian Lord was set on 
leaving, not caring for sleep.

&quot;Save your strength,&quot; Natsuki&#39;s voice warned. &quot;You will need it.&quot;

- - -

&quot;Oh, this isn&#39;t good.&quot; It was a worried little phrase that Mai had 
uttered countless times that day. She and the others sat in the middle 
of the Altar of the Ikusahime within the main HiME base of operations. 
Underground and surrounded by loyal soldiers, it seemed like the most 
logical place to gather for a strategy meeting. In the aftermath of the 
failed Emulator raid, a plan was very much needed. But with Fujino, who 
had been somewhat of a leader, now a slave to the Obsidian Lord, who 
would take up the lead?

Midori had tried, but had been too dramatic in her opening motivational 
speech. As a result, no one had taken her seriously and she now sat 
pouting a few feet away. This left a bewildered and somewhat lost Mai to 
take up the position of grand HiME field marshal, or whatever rank put 
her in charge of the whole damn mess. There were multiple chaotic 
conversations around her, everyone having some differing viewpoint on 
the matters at hand.

&quot;Are we going to have to kill them?&quot;

&quot;No, surely there&#39;s some way to avoid that.&quot;

&quot;But what if it&#39;s out of necessity? And Alyssa! What about her?&quot;

&quot;Like she could even handle being brought back into the world after so 
long a sleep. We&#39;d be doing her a favor.&quot;

&quot;If those women have to be killed to stop the world from ending, then 
dammit, I say..&quot;

There needed to be some kind of order to it all, and if Mai was the only 
one who could do that, then so be it. She stood up from her position on 
the floor and raised her voice enough to let it boom over the others. It 
wasn&#39;t stern, just attention grabbing. &quot;Now just wait a minute!&quot;

All eyes turned to her, some people with their mouths still open from 
being cut off in the middle of a sentence. Mai blinked a few times in 
uncertainty, not sure exactly where to go from there. She herself wasn&#39;t 
exactly sure what to do in regards to the situation they faced. Mai had 
one advantage, however. She had been, with Mikoto, one of the last HiMEs 
to see the end of the Carnival before Mashiro worked her last minute 
trickery. The pair of them had spent more time with the Obsidian Lord 
than anyone else in the group. She had to draw on that experience.

&quot;The last time this happened, it was kind of similar. The Obsidian Lord 
took a host and he had Mikoto for a guardian, but we were able to get 
both of them back without major injury. There&#39;s no need to rush out and 
kill either Natsuki or Shizuru. Besides, the Lord would just find a new 
host if we did that,&quot; Mai reasoned.

&quot;Mai said she loved me! So I didn&#39;t want to fight,&quot; Mikoto confirmed, 
nodding her head.

Nao rolled her eyes. &quot;Yeah, but that&#39;s because you and Mikoto had some 
sick little bond going on. Shizuru&#39;s the Obsidian Lord&#39;s hand now. It&#39;s 
not the same. No one here is close with Shizuru. No one here is even 
friends with Shizuru. The only people she cares about are Natsuki and 
Alyssa, and they&#39;re on the other side. She had no reason to listen to 
anything we say.&quot;

&quot;That aside, we still managed to get the Obsidian Lord before Reito 
could be killed,&quot; Mai reminded. &quot;His power was stemming from Mashiro&#39;s 
body and the HiME Star. So if we can get Alyssa out of the Emulator 
somehow, and if we can destroy that new Star, we stop everything before 
Natsuki is harmed.&quot;

&quot;The Star isn&#39;t all that close. From the looks of things, it&#39;d take us 
days to reach it, and the Children can&#39;t provide us with orbital life 
support that long. I don&#39;t imagine robes couldn&#39;t either,&quot; Akira pointed 
out.

&quot;So, what? We can&#39;t destroy the Star just yet, so we have to run around 
Kyoto with Shizuru on our tail until we can?&quot; Nao huffed. &quot;Not my thing. 
Much as it sucks to kill that creepy kid, our best chance is to rush in 
there, blow up the Emulator and take the Obsidian Lord down with it. His 
&#39;digital copy&#39; has gotta be stored on it.&quot;

Midori shook her head. &quot;Did a lot of research in the archives here, when 
we first arrived and when I was still undercover. Never saw anything 
about any safe extraction of the human cores in the old Emulators. We 
might just have to say goodbye to Alyssa-chan then and there. We can 
try, but who knows if it&#39;ll even be safe to try considering we&#39;ll be 
swarmed by the enemy.&quot;

Akane tentatively spoke up for the first time that meeting. &quot;W-well, if 
something could be done to get her out, don&#39;t you think Miyu would have 
tried by now? She could technically overpower Natsuki, so there&#39;d be no 
need to let herself be enslaved unless Alyssa&#39;s only life support was 
the machine itself. ...Right?&quot;

&quot;Catgirl has a point,&quot; Nao managed to insult and compliment at the same 
time.

Mai groaned slightly. Damn it, would they really have to go through with 
killing Alyssa? If it came down to it, then... yes, it would have to be 
done. It was better for Alyssa to go than to be a human battery for the 
rest of eternity. Her spirit needed to pass and be reborn, as the others 
had the luxury of doing. &quot;Fine. If we have to, in order to stop the 
Carnival, I guess we might have to kill her. But if there&#39;s another way, 
we&#39;ll take it.&quot;

&quot;And the other two?&quot; Yukino asked.

&quot;There&#39;s gotta be a way around it,&quot; Mai continued to preach. &quot;Reito and 
Mikoto didn&#39;t have to die, so neither should they. Attack if they start 
something, I guess, but try to just knock them out or disarm instead of 
just killing them.&quot;

Nao, and occasionally Akira, took up the other position, and the debate 
raged for quite some time. The Carnival had barely even begun and 
emotions were flaring up. A side effect of the Obsidian Lord&#39;s new 
presence amongst the far reaching Emulator wavelengths? Whatever the 
case, all those involved felt the pressure of the battles to come. One 
of the HiMEs who had been &#39;recruited&#39; in the midst of the last battle 
began to have doubts. Although vague memories of conflict were in her 
mind, something was unsettling. She could not betray Garderobe so 
readily. So, as the others verbally warred, she began to slip out 
unnoticed.

Headmistress forgive her.

- - -

Mashiro had kept silent for a very long time, as military matters 
weren&#39;t exactly her forte. The current situation was quite severe, 
however, and things were most certainly not how they should have been. 
So, in her truest and bossiest fashion, Mashiro began to storm down to 
the depths of Dammerung to face the Headmistress to find out just what 
the hell was going on. A nation&#39;s Otome had been banished and 
disconnected from her robe. Shizuru was switching sides more than a 
bisexual hooker. Representatives had vanished. Monsters were roaming the 
streets. It was just too much!

Haruka was with her, also concerned and equally bossy. Their combined 
effort would surely be enough to strong arm any information from the 
Garderobe brass. Haruka was as loyal as ever, but it was unfair for 
things to be kept so quiet. Everyone had a right to know what was going 
on, after all. It was for the safety of all those involved. Information 
was power, and soldiers needed to be kept up to date on what was truly 
happening around them to be effective warriors. She cracked her 
knuckles, a bad habit, as she walked alongside the lavender haired girl.

As she marched down the hall, she found Shizuru heading in the opposite 
direction. Mashiro waved an arm to get her to stop, but the Archmeister 
let it bounce off as if she had never noticed it. She was on some kind 
of mission, and did not even stop to turn around to look at the young 
queen. &quot;Hey! Archmeister Viola, wait a moment!&quot;

Nothing. Shizuru disappeared down the hall like she was deaf to their 
calls. Haruka looked as if she was a bit offended by the lack of 
attention. &quot;Viola! You! Bubuzuke-onna!&quot;

When the Archmeister vanished, they were left to continue on to meet 
with Natsuki instead. Haruka fumed next to the queen, her muscles tense 
and her stand demanding respect. It was uncommon for Haruka not to get 
her way. She was usually loud enough to force anyone into submission. 
But never Shizuru. That woman had always been a constant source of 
annoyance. In recent times, especially.

They reached Natsuki&#39;s quarters just as the Headmistress was leaving 
them. The dark haired woman adjusted her blue trench coat and barely 
noticed that they were present at all. It was only after a few quiet 
seconds that Natsuki bothered to greet them. &quot;And what can I do for you, 
your highness?&quot;

&quot;We want to know what the hell is going on! Shizuru&#39;s back again, you&#39;ve 
dismissed my onee-sama, and nothing makes any sense!&quot; Haruka naturally 
took charge before Mashiro could do anything.

Mashiro tried to lighten the mood a bit. &quot;Ah! What she&#39;s trying to say 
is, well, we need to know what&#39;s going on to properly handle things. 
Some of these actions have been worrying. On what grounds did you banish 
Ann Lu? She&#39;s the Otome of one of the kingdoms, so she can&#39;t just be 
given the boot. The political ramifications of that...&quot;

&quot;Will be dealt with,&quot; Natsuki finished. &quot;If you must know, she was 
dismissed from her duties due to the fact that she was the one that 
allowed the HiME to infiltrate Dammerung. She was guilty of treason.&quot;

&quot;...What?!&quot; Haruka screeched. &quot;That&#39;s... Ann would never do that!&quot;

&quot;Wrong.&quot;

&quot;But what about the other missing Otome? Akane and Shiho, and all the 
rest who have vanished. The diplomats, too. You&#39;re forgetting that we 
came here on a diplomatic mission, and we weren&#39;t meant to get involved 
in any actual war. We should get everyone and just go home before this 
becomes an even bigger mess,&quot; Mashiro reasoned.

She could see Natsuki clench her jaw in irritation. The words that came 
out were controlled, but an underlying tone of anger was evident. 
&quot;Mashiro, I am handling this by the book. Ann committed treason, so she 
was dismissed. I have Otome battling those monsters to protect you and 
the rest of the team. And believe me &#150; I am continually hunting for our 
missing personnel.&quot;

With that, Natsuki left them for the command room, where she found 
herself glued to the monitors that gave her feeds of various places in 
Kyoto. Mashiro and Haruka could only stand and watch her go, entirely 
frustrated by the situation. Mashiro had a tough decision to make. 
Technically, she outranked Natsuki and could exercise her political 
power to get everything in order. She could take charge... but would it 
work? Ah! Shizuru had gone looking as if she&#39;d been assigned to a 
mission.

&quot;Did you hear anything about Shizuru being sent out to do something?&quot; 
Mashiro asked her companion.

Haruka shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t hear anything beyond &#39;defend the parameter.&#39;&quot;

&quot;Perimeter, I think.&quot; When Haruka rolled her eyes, Mashiro took it as a 
sign to continue. &quot;Well, maybe you should follow her to see what 
Natsuki&#39;s up to?&quot;

Haruka&#39;s eyes lit up with a sense of duty. It was a covert and stealthy 
mission to discover the truth behind a conspiracy going on in the 
academy&#39;s highest ranks! The GEM would have to be turned off, as Natsuki 
could easily track its position and get suspicious. But it was fine. She 
could hold her own against anyone using just her flesh and blood. She 
prided herself on being virile without the GEM&#39;s augmentations. It set 
her apart from the rest, she thought. Even Shizuru. What could that 
bubuzuke-onna really do to her now that she had destroyed the Graceful 
Amethyst GEM?

&quot;No problem, your highness! She&#39;ll never know I&#39;m trailing her!&quot; Haruka 
switched off her GEM and took off down the hall at top speed, hoping to 
catch up with her new &#39;target.&#39; Mashiro quietly wondered if it wouldn&#39;t 
have been better to send someone else on a mission that required grace 
and silence.

- - -

She safely exited the HiME base without much resistance, as the guards 
were all under the impression that she was no longer a threat. They&#39;d 
taken her GEM upon arrival. Stripped of a weapon and armor, she couldn&#39;t 
make any sudden movements. HiME were on one side. Otome who felt she was 
a traitor were on the other. In between was a horde of monsters ready to 
tear her flesh off her bones. The return to Dammerung was going to be 
rather treacherous, but she&#39;d been trained to handle it.

Her legs carried her swiftly down the tree laden hillside that led down 
into the city, taking her away from the nest of the HiME. Her chest 
heaved as she brought in enough air to fuel her sprint. Branches whipped 
against her face, but she didn&#39;t care. She had to return. Too much 
longer and there would be no place for her. She couldn&#39;t, she just 
couldn&#39;t, leave her Garderobe comrades like that. She&#39;d been there too 
long, and she had mentors who meant the world to her. It was treason and 
it was dishonorable. She couldn&#39;t buy into this Ikusahime nonsense. She 
didn&#39;t remember anything they did. Nothing about this &#39;hunt through 
Kyoto&#39; or much of this Carnival business. A vague memory of pain and 
fire. That was it. She wanted no part of it.

She&#39;d go back to Garderobe and resume her classes, and everything would 
be normal again. All this chaos was too much to handle.

Jumping onto and over a rock, she landed roughly on slippery mud, a 
fresh fallen rain having moistened the ground. She slipped slightly, but 
maintained her balance. Her boots slid along the surface, surfing down 
the sloping ground. When she came to a halt she proceeded to run once 
more, eyes scanning the trees for any sign of danger. She felt so 
vulnerable. What if the other Ikusahime came after her for deserting 
them? Would they really chase her? Would they have noticed her absence 
by now?

After a half mile of slipping and running down the Kyoto foothills, 
Yukariko came to a halt. She quickly took in her surroundings and tried 
to navigate in the fairly unfamiliar landscape. If I keep going this 
way... just a little bit further to the south. Dammerung should be 
there. Was that right? It was so confusing to do this without her robe&#39;s 
flight capabilities.

She put a foot down, intent on moving again, but timidly returned to a 
normal stance when she felt the ground quake. Tectonic...? No, that 
couldn&#39;t be it. Her nerves lit up and adrenaline began to pump through 
her system. Instincts proving right, the ground soon gave way to a 
monstrous form. The path ahead became blocked by a large purple serpent 
of some kind. A Slave?!

Yukariko turned to run back the way she came, but saw an identical 
creature rise up from the soil. Soon two more appeared on either side. 
She was entirely surrounded by serpents, and she did not have a GEM to 
call her own. Those damned HiME! Her evasive skills kicked into high 
gear when the ground below her began to crumble away. She jumped off 
what seemed to be the body of a massive hydra, rolling to a stop once 
she hit the ground.

Springing to her feet once again, she searched for a decent escape 
route. She couldn&#39;t fight something that size by herself. Turning on her 
heel, she took off to the southeast, but skidded to a halt the moment 
she saw someone who had once been her ally. Now, she wasn&#39;t sure. Wasn&#39;t 
this the Archmeister&#39;s &#39;Child?&#39; Trying the diplomatic approach first, 
Yukariko extended an arm.

&quot;Shizuru!&quot; A red bardiche snapped up in Shizuru&#39;s arms, and that 
answered the blonde&#39;s inner question. &quot;Are you bringing your weapon up 
against me? I&#39;m going back to Dammerung! I&#39;m not your enemy.&quot;

She didn&#39;t even know how to properly reason with Shizuru. There were too 
many facets of the war. Shizuru might not have even been fighting for 
Dammerung alone. This girl was such a wildcard! Her true cause was 
mysterious and her actions erratic. What was Yukariko supposed to do? 
Her right hand trembled, and she felt a searing heat race through her 
body, borne from a small patch of skin next to her jaw. What was that 
sensation? Was that...?

Shizuru looked entirely disconnected from the world around her. Having 
lost her composure, Shizuru&#39;s dark side had fully emerged, and she began 
to taunt her new opponent like a conceited villain. &quot;My, my... having to 
run away from a group of teenagers like a frightened deer. I was under 
the impression that faith alone would save you. How pathetic you now 
seem.&quot;

Kiyohime writhed behind her, but she tried to pay no attention to it. &quot;I 
don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with you, Shizuru, but snap out of it!&quot;

&quot;It is amusing, really. I can remember, so clearly, the day when 
Kiyohime ripped your body apart in order to put an end to the original 
Columns,&quot; Shizuru recalled. Her face fell into a dark frown. &quot;And if we 
could do that to you, then what will stop the others from doing the same 
thing to my dear Alyssa?&quot;

&quot;I... they aren&#39;t wanting to kill her! They want to try and save her 
from the Emulator core! No one wants to harm this... Alyssa girl,&quot; 
Yukariko explained, straining her memory for any indication of a child 
named Alyssa. A young blonde choir girl, was it?

A broken smile. &quot;The deadline is short. They won&#39;t have time to research 
the procedures, if they even exist. Because of that I cannot deviate. 
Sister, please do not give into defeat so readily. At your very core, 
you know what must happen. Do it with honor, or let me finish you 
quickly.&quot;

When Shizuru began to move, and when Yukariko heard Kiyohime hiss from 
multiple angles, she found herself given in to her primal desire to 
fight. That ancient power howled inside like a beast waiting to escape 
from a tightly locked cage. As Shizuru moved forward, preparing to swing 
her weapon, Yukariko released all that hidden strength. With a shout, 
she held both her arms up. In her hands formed a stylistic bow much like 
her standard Otome Element. A quick shot forced Shizuru to evade, giving 
the former nun time to scurry to the side and prepare for a true battle.

Shizuru managed a small grin. &quot;As you wish.&quot;

Yukariko fired another arrow of energy towards her opponent. Shizuru 
ducked and charged forward, flinging the chain of her bardiche out. The 
end lashed towards Yukariko, who came to a quick halt and held out her 
left hand. One of the Otome&#39;s pan-robe abilities was a skill that had 
once been Yukariko&#39;s alone, Searrs having taken it during the death of 
the HiME. As she extended her arm, an energetic defensive shield formed 
to block Shizuru&#39;s incoming attack.

The bardiche bounced off the nearly invisible wall, and Shizuru quickly 
retracted it. Before the slave of the Obsidian Lord could strike a 
second time, Yukariko pushed that defensive barrier out, knocking 
Shizuru back with a telekinetic shove. Everything came quite naturally, 
but was that because Yukariko began to remember, or because her Otome 
robe had most of the same functions?

Yukariko decided to pray upon Shizuru&#39;s recovery time as the other woman 
began to climb to her feet. The instructor fired her Element, and 
Shizuru was forced to roll out of harm&#39;s way. Another arrow shrieked 
towards her as she finally stood. With quick reaction time, Shizuru 
brought her bulky blade up in time to turn it into a makeshift shield. 
The arrow hit the weapon and vaporized on impact. But it was a volley 
that followed that forced Shizuru to go on the proper defensive.

Kiyohime slithered away in one direction while Shizuru sprinted into the 
dense forest at an opposite angle, Yukariko firing after her until 
Shizuru disappeared from sight. Was that it, then? Had Shizuru 
surrendered? Surely not. Yukariko felt like there were predatory eyes on 
her, stemming from some unknown location. She slowly began to walk in 
the direction that Shizuru had gone, her Element held high and ready to 
fire with the release of her taut arm.

Every slow and controlled step was silent. Yukariko&#39;s eyes scanned the 
underbrush and the tree branches with meticulous care, waiting for the 
rival Ikusahime to jump up at any given moment. She kept low and 
strained her ears to detect any kind of abnormal noise coming from the 
woods, her nanomachines having increased her senses ever so slightly 
after the initial injection years upon years ago. Despite the battle, 
even the birds were silent. The wind was still. There was nothing that 
indicated another presence was even there. But Yukariko knew full well 
that just as she was hunting Shizuru, Shizuru was hunting her. It all 
depending upon which one had the most patience &#150; and Yukariko had quite 
a bit.

Finding cover in thick underbrush, her green uniform blending in quite 
nicely, she waited silently for any sign of movement. All she needed was 
for Shizuru to move first. Then it would be too late. She kept her ears 
active in hopes of not being caught off guard by a surprise attack from 
behind. She had tried to keep herself strategically situated by the tree 
to prevent that from happening. She was certain that Shizuru had gone 
this way. She had to be out further in the distance. She had to.

She focused so intently on the trees and growth that her eyes began to 
feel sore. For five minutes she sat and waited, Element ready. Then, 
finally! She saw a purple kimono between a pair of trees. Shizuru was 
finding a new place to hide, or purposefully trying to draw Yukariko 
out. It didn&#39;t matter. Yukariko had the ranged weapon. Shizuru&#39;s chain 
whip was limited. And Yukariko had the aim of a world class 
sharpshooter, comparative with Natsuki&#39;s skill in the heavy firearm 
category.

Yukariko&#39;s clenched hand opened abruptly, the energy arrow flying out 
through the woods, sailing passed trees and stumps. Somewhat 
miraculously, it narrowly shot through the two trees that Shizuru was 
behind. Yukariko could see the body flinch. It hadn&#39;t been a deep wound, 
only a scratch, but it had been something that proved that Shizuru was 
not an invincible demon from the netherworld.

In an inwardly heated, but externally calculated, reaction, Shizuru used 
her chain whip to cut through both of the trees. The pair fell forward, 
towards Yukariko. They were well out of range, but she took the chaos as 
a prime moment to run and find a new hiding place. While Shizuru 
searched for her, bardiche hugged close to her body, Yukariko scrambled 
up a nearby tree, ducking down on one of the branches to keep as best 
out of sight as she could.

As Shizuru made for cover, Yukariko fired a second time. Shizuru must 
have detected the flash of light, as she knocked the arrow away with her 
weapon before it could hit. Shizuru dashed forward with surprisingly 
intimidating speed, closing the distance between them as Yukariko leapt 
down from the tree. She was too close, then. Well within range to use 
the chain whip. Yukariko prepared to go on the defensive as she fled, 
sliding down an incline and into a small ravine.

Now, in the narrow cut through the ground, they faced a dangerous 
situation. Evasion would be difficult for either of them. Yukariko fired 
her weapon, and Shizuru ducked below the attack. Seeing that Shizuru was 
set to lash out with the chain whip of her bardiche, Yukariko had only 
one real option left. She filled her lungs with air and then released it 
with a mighty shout.

&quot;St. Vlas!&quot;

Only half-expecting that he would come to her aid, given her distrust of 
the HiME thusfar, she found herself momentarily stunned by the creature. 
His red eyes lit up and forced Shizuru to stop in her tracks. While 
Shizuru fell victim to St. Vlas&#39; mind manipulation, Yukariko scurried 
out of the ravine to find a good place to get a ranged shot in, like a 
sniper hunting for cover.

&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about getting a motorcycle,&quot; Alyssa said to her.

With that horrid statement, Shizuru was forced to put down her book of 
ancient Japanese poetry to properly address the idea. Why? Was one Kuga 
sister risking life and limb for the sake of adrenaline not enough? Yes, 
it was fun to go on a road trip, but Alyssa was so young. It wasn&#39;t 
fair. Shizuru, and no doubt Natsuki, would be worrying far too much if 
such a thing were to happen. &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Because they&#39;re cool.&quot;

&quot;Some people think chainsaw killer movies are cool, but one does not 
generally go out and slaughter a group of teenagers in such a fashion.&quot; 
She was an older sister figure like Natsuki, was she not? Shizuru could 
technically put her foot down on the issue, despite the fact that Alyssa 
was just shy of becoming a proper adult.

The blonde woman shrugged. &quot;Highly efficient, really. And I could 
customize it with a lot of secret gadgets, like James Bond and his cars. 
It would just take adequate planning and ample time. But no matter.&quot;

&quot;If you get road rash in some gut wrenching accident, I&#39;ll have to keep 
you from that bike using any method possible. That Natsuki is not a good 
influence on you. She&#39;ll be getting a talking to tonight. If I find out 
you&#39;re beginning to like firearms, she&#39;ll be even worse off.&quot;

Alyssa blushed wildly. &quot;I...It&#39;s not like that! This has nothing to do 
with sister worship!&quot;

&quot;Ara, ara... Why do you look so flustered, then?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not!&quot; She nearly pouted.

Shizuru could not help but grin. How like the other one. Both were just 
so wonderfully cute when they became embarrassed. &quot;There&#39;s no real shame 
in looking up to your dear onee-chan. It&#39;s quite charming. Just try to 
focus on her less dangerous attributes for my sake. You know how 
concerned I can be when it comes to your well being.&quot;

&quot;Yes, you and Natsuki were experts and driving my last date away. He&#39;s 
afraid to even set foot in Kyoto now. I hope you&#39;re both very happy.&quot;

&quot;He was rude. You deserved better, so we simply got rid of the young 
man,&quot; Shizuru defended with a small smile.

&quot;Ah, don&#39;t say that like you&#39;re a member of the mob!&quot;

&quot;My aunt knows a person who has a roommate who...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve heard all that before, and don&#39;t believe a word of it.&quot;

Shizuru shrugged and watched the younger girl stand from the couch, 
moving to gather her belongings. &quot;Very well, but you mustn&#39;t say that I 
didn&#39;t give you fair warning about family connections with the darker 
side of Moscow.&quot;

Alyssa turned to head towards the door that led out of Natsuki and 
Shizuru&#39;s home, but turned back at the last second. Like Natsuki, she 
was quite emotionally reserved. The few exceptions were spared for Miyu, 
Natsuki and Shizuru, who was just as good as family. Shizuru smiled 
happily as Alyssa reached over to give her a short but loving hug around 
the neck, Shizuru&#39;s arms briefly coming into contact with a torso that 
quickly escaped the hold. &quot;I have to go make some headway on a project 
for work. Would you and Natsuki like to come over for dinner?&quot;

As gathering around a table, either at Shizuru and Natsuki&#39;s place or at 
Miyu&#39;s, for a family dinner was tradition, she could not refuse. &quot;I will 
tell Natsuki that dinner is at your house, then. She&#39;ll be home 
shortly.&quot;

Alyssa nodded and headed for the door, but Shizuru stood, hoping to 
catch her off guard like she did with Natsuki so many times. As the 
young blonde started off, Shizuru quickly caught her around the torso. 
Arms held Alyssa tight while Shizuru grinned like a giddy child, unable 
to see the blush but knowing full well that it was there. Alyssa was 
such a darling younger sister-in-law. It was simply amazing to see how 
much of Natsuki had manifested in Alyssa over the years. Shizuru knew 
full well that Natsuki felt honored and complete to have genuine living 
family who cared about her, and that fact lit Shizuru&#39;s heart up as 
well. She had never had a sister before. It was a warm and pleasant 
feeling...

...that was snatched from her all to suddenly as everything around her 
vanished. Her mind snapped her back into reality, where she was forced 
to remember that Alyssa had been entrapped for over a thousand years, 
her innocence stolen and her body a tool used by a depraved organization 
that had already inflicted undue suffering upon the girl at the tender 
age of nine. It was not fair. It was not right. Shizuru&#39;s blood boiled.

- - -

Shizuru re-entered the real world in between the two sides of St. Vlas&#39; 
iron maiden chamber, both ready to snap shut at Yukariko&#39;s command. The 
Ikusahime had gone, and now stood above the ridge, watching Shizuru and 
trying to find the perfect moment to make that final strike. She was 
hesitant, naturally. Shizuru was still one of the elite warriors at 
Garderobe and had been a valued ally in battle for many years. Yukariko 
was not sure if she could really do it.

It was that fact that allowed Shizuru to strike. How dare that Child. 
How dare it force me to remember such wonderful memories in great 
detail, only to torture me further with the knowledge that I am always 
one step away from losing Alyssa forever. Damn you, cruel saint.

Her soul alight with fury, Shizuru performed a lightening fast lunge 
with her bardiche, the tip of her weapon piercing through the exposed 
center of St. Vlas. There was a loud and deep groan from the horse-like 
figure as it struggled to pull itself off the weapon, mutating into its 
bird form to try and fly away. Shizuru would not let it. She twisted her 
weapon and withdrew it, leaving a gaping wound. Spinning round, she 
finished the injured Child off by slicing through it top to bottom using 
the chain whip, sweat having formed on her brow. She stared at the 
disappearing enemy with fiery eyes that had become enveloped with rage 
and bloodlust.

Yukariko screamed in the distance, dropping to her knees as she felt the 
tug on her soul... that same pain that all the other Ikusahime had felt 
in their previous lifetime. Most precious person. Yukariko&#39;s Key became 
the victim, set to disappear with the Child. Yukariko dropped to the 
ground with a lifeless expression, her emotional balance destroyed. She 
was worth nothing now &#150; useless to the Ikusahime and to the Otome. She 
was lost, powerless and soulless. The walking dead.

One of Kiyohime&#39;s head dipped down into the ravine, and Shizuru 
willingly stepped onto it, the beast gently taking her up and out. As 
the last bits of green dust wafted away in the wind, Kiyohime took her 
mistress out of the area, knowing all too well that the rest of the 
Ikusahime surely heard the screams and the roars. She could not fight 
all of them at once, no matter how skilled she was. Shizuru was forced 
to make an exit, her mission partially accomplished.

Yukariko stared after her, unmoving and apathetic.

The veteran Otome had come into the Headmistress&#39; office to deliver the 
latest news from the international assembly to the Galactic Aquamarine, 
who was filling in for their missing leader. She sat the papers down on 
the desk, and Sara gave her a kind smile while in the middle of a phone 
call. The blonde soon put down the device after concluding her 
conversation with a dignitary, and properly thanked the other woman for 
her efforts. &quot;I hope it wasn&#39;t much trouble today. Things have been so 
frantic as it is.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s quite stressful given the situation, but it was manageable. It is 
mainly the diplomats who are worried. After all, it is their Otome who 
have been dispatched as part of the support team to Earth, and their 
lives are still bound to their guardians. I would...&quot;

Sara furrowed her brows. &quot;You would...?&quot;

She brought a hand to her chest. What was this... sudden pain? She felt 
almost like she was having some kind of heart attack, but she was in 
such good shape for her age. This didn&#39;t make any sense. Her breath 
caught in her throat and she became unable say a word. Her usually stern 
eyes looked up pleadingly at Sara, who could only stare back in shock 
before the temporary headmistress could properly act. She slammed her 
button down on the intercom, calling her assistants.

&quot;Send a doctor up here immediately!&quot; Sara shouted. She then came to the 
other female&#39;s side. &quot;Miss Maria! Miss Maria, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

The long time teacher and staff member tentatively reached out at 
nothing, and watched in absolute horror as her hand broke up on the 
molecular level, turning into a fine green haze. This is what happened 
to Slaves when they died, and what happened to Otome masters when the 
guardian fell in battle. But how? She was no Otome master. This should 
not have been happening! Maria wanted to scream, but could not, and her 
mind began to spin as more of her arm faded away in a green mist.

Sara gasped and watched with fear in her eyes. She tried to grab hold of 
Maria, but every hand or arm she tried to touch snapped and broke into 
that same fine dust, like disturbing a sand dune. Everything crumbled 
away into nothingness, and Maria&#39;s silent screams filled the air as her 
throat, jaw and face finally vanished. Soon, all that was left of Maria 
was her GEM, which hit the ground with a dull clank. Sara could hardly 
believe her eyes. Was she dreaming? She must have been.

When Youko and the other doctors came rushing up into the office, it was 
already too late. In grim reality, Maria had perished. The senior most 
warrior, and one of the most skilled, had been lost to some unknown foe. 
And what could they do but mourn?

Deep with Dammerung, one of the eleven lights on the doors to the 
Emulator room began to glow a faint green. The first Key had been 
acquired.</pre>
