<a href="../crossover/1honor-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Honor Harrington breathed out, standing
on her flag bridge as the admiral junior grade waited.

&quot;Bleek,&quot; Nimitz agreed, the treecat holding on to her
shoulder to peer out into space.

Eighth fleet was spread out on the front lines, now
reinforced to have the numbers to hold the line if
needed. And they had, fighting off both Jurain tree
ships, Galaxy police crews and many of the allies of
that great star nation, not yielding this vital
forward point, keeping the route open to launch an
attack on the Jurai homeworld itself. The strain was
telling on the ships, field repairs and battle scars
marking them, but to those who knew they were badges
of honor.

&quot;Glad to see us?&quot; Ryouko asked with a grin. The blue
haired ruler of Manticore stood on the bridge of the
Washu&#39;s Revenge, the massive vessel leading several of
the boxy craft that were the latest products of
Manticore and Griffin&#39;s shipyards. More seriously she
said, &quot;You&#39;ve done a hell of a job out here the past
few months, thank you.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Honor nodded, &quot;my crews&#39; thank you.&quot;

&quot;Are those what I think they are?&quot; Captain Michelle
Henke asked, the dusky skinned captain looking at the
vessels eagerly.

Washu chuckled, the small, redheaded scientist
nodding, &quot;They&#39;re ready, crews too.&quot;

&quot;Then we&#39;re finally ready,&quot; Honor murmured.

&quot;Come aboard the Revenge,&quot; Ryouko said quietly, &quot;we&#39;re
organizing a captain&#39;s meeting. It&#39;s time to get ready
to end this.&quot;

Not long after Honor and Michelle walked the corridors
of the Revenge, heading to the main conference hall,
Nimitz cradled in Honor&#39;s arms &quot;It&#39;s strange,&quot;
Michelle murmured as they reached the doors, &quot;how long
ago it feels since we were here.&quot;

&quot;As long as you&#39;re with me,&quot; Honor murmured, &quot;it could
have been forever.&quot;

With a blush of pleasure Michelle followed Honor into
the conference room, eyes sweeping the table. Both
familiar and several unfamiliar faces were at the
table, a sign of the rapid promotions that had been
going on in this time of war.

&quot;Welcome,&quot; Kiyone looked up, her long black hair
falling down her back. She looked good in her
Manticore uniform, having clearly settled in to her
new role on Ryouko&#39;s staff.

&quot;Yo,&quot; Minagi nodded, but the blue haired young woman&#39;s
face was grim. Her lover Nagi had been sent on a
mission to Jurai months ago and had quite simply
vanished. Her determination to find out what happened
positively radiated off her, as did her anger.

Ryouko looked up from the head of the table where she
was in conversation with Washu and Yume. &quot;About time,&quot;
she grinned, moving to take her seat. Around the table
men and women sat a few junior officers leaning up
against the walls. Seriously she said, &quot;You&#39;ve done
the hard work out here, keeping Jurai bottled up here,
good work.&quot;

Honor actually blushed, seemingly at a loss for words.

Washu looked amused, the little redheaded scientist
taking pity as she activated the monitor. &quot;We&#39;ve kept
our research projects under tight security,&quot; she
explained, &quot;so many of you in this room don&#39;t know al
the details of what we&#39;re hauling.&quot;

&quot;Or at least nothing but the name,&quot; Titan commented,
the brown haired young woman smiling.

&quot;Bleek,&quot; Nimitz sounded amused.

&quot;Starting from designs from the Griffon Navy,&quot; Washu
showed images of a small, agile strike craft, &quot;we&#39;ve
designed a powerful space vessel that crews one and is
far more maneuverable than any larger vessel.&quot;

Minagi smiled slightly, &quot;What took the longest was
getting the assembly lies going and training the
pilots, really. That and modifying transports to carry
them.&quot;

&quot;How effective are they going to be?&quot; Michelle asked,
leaning forward intently.

&quot;Yohko?&quot; Ryouko nodded to the young woman.

Yamamoto Yohko nodded, her long hair and almost
catlike eyes giving her an impish look. &quot;We took our
first few fighters out on a test run in a remote
border skirmish,&quot; she related as she stood casually in
front of the assembled captains, &quot;there were just four
fighters and three cruisers against six Jurain third
generation treeships.&quot;

Minagi grinned, &quot;None of the treeships escaped.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the tactical doctrine for using the fighters?&quot;
Honor asked intently, &quot;How long will we have to shake
down our combined fleets?&quot;

&quot;A week,&quot; Ryouko answered. She sighed and waited for
all the protests to die down before continuing, &quot;I
know that&#39;s not long, but one of the best advantages
we&#39;re going to get is keeping the fighters a secret.
The longer we delay the attack, the more likely that
Jurai or the Galaxy Police are going to find out about
them.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll get it done,&quot; Yohko said firmly.

&quot;I notice you just mentioned Jurai and Galaxy Police,&quot;
Michelle noted, &quot;does that mean what I think it does?&quot;

Kiyone nodded with a grin, &quot;Most of Jurai&#39;s allies
have formally declined to help them defend planet
Jurai.&quot; She paused, her eyes filled with a kind of
regret, &quot;The only major hold out is Galaxy Police, and
it looks like they&#39;ll be there till the end.&quot;

&quot;After all of this is over someone is going to have to
take a serious look at how deep Jurai was in with the
Galaxy Police,&quot; Yume noted from where the scientist
sat by her lover Washu, &quot;I still can&#39;t believe the
Marshal would go to war for them.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s not get too overconfident,&quot; Ryouko looked
around the room with steely eyes. &quot;We&#39;ll be facing
first generation treeships alongside the best of the
Galaxy Police, ships that are more powerful than
anything our fleet has fought before,&quot; she reminded
them.

Honor surprised herself by speaking up, &quot;Maybe so, but
I&#39;m confident in our people.&quot; She paused, meeting
Ryouko&#39;s eyes, &quot;And confident in our leader.&quot;

&quot;You got that right,&quot; Minagi grinned, noting with some
amusement that her sister was the one blushing, this
time.

&quot;All right, all right,&quot; Ryouko quieted down her
captains again. &quot;Everyone head back to your ships,&quot;
she said, &quot;we have a week of simulated combat runs
with the fighters to go through.&quot; As the captains
filed out she called, &quot;Honor?&quot;

&quot;I hope I didn&#39;t mess up your speech too much,&quot; Honor
said softly, Michelle lingering nearby, &quot;I don&#39;t
normally give in to impulse like that.&quot;

&quot;Couldn&#39;t have planned it better myself,&quot; Ryouko
answered. She smiled, &quot;No insult intended but I plan
to be on the Revenge during the assault. You&#39;ve been
in command of the system up to now, so I thought you
should know.&quot;

&quot;Washu&#39;s Revenge is the best place for you to be,&quot;
Honor said frankly, &quot;especially if this gets as hairy
as I think it will.&quot;

&quot;You think it&#39;s going to get nasty too?&quot; Ryouko said.

&quot;This is Jurai&#39;s last stand,&quot; Honor answered frankly,
&quot;if it gets desperate they&#39;re going to throw
everything they have at us.&quot;

&quot;About what I thought,&quot; Ryouko agreed. She looked over
at Michelle a second, then back at Honor, &quot;Did I ever
tell you I was attracted to you when we first met?&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Honor blinked, confused by the sudden change of
topic.

Ryouko laughed softly, &quot;I hope Captain Henke knows
what sort of prize she has.&quot; With that the Empress
left, still chuckling to herself softly.

Later that night Honor and Michelle lay in bed
together, talking softly. &quot;I still can&#39;t believe she
said that,&quot; Honor murmured, cheeks flaming.

&quot;That&#39;s because you don&#39;t understand how attractive
you are,&quot; Michelle answered. She toyed with Honor&#39;s
short brow hair, &quot;What do you think will happen?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Honor admitted, &quot;but I&#39;m hopeful we&#39;ll
win.&quot;

&quot;I mean after that,&quot; Michelle answered.

&quot;Defeating Jurai&#39;s fleet is only the start,&quot; Honor
said, &quot;Ryouko then gets to fight the harder war to win
over the people.&quot; She paused before adding, &quot;I almost
think our job is going to be easier.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t go that far,&quot; Michelle chuckled. She
cuddled close, &quot;No matter what happens, I&#39;m glad that
I have you.&quot;

Honor held Michelle to her, breathing in her scent,
&quot;Me too.&quot;

Outside in the suite Nimitz curled up in front of the
door, a disgusted look on the treecat&#39;s face over
being locked out of the bedroom. &quot;Bleek,&quot; he grumped
and lay down to sleep.

End

Notes: the story continues in Tenchi Muyo Conquest,
hosted on fanfiction.net, mediaminer.org and the
tmffa.com. My intent here was to get into the
backstory of Tenchi Muyo Conquest, most of it told
from Honor Harrington&#39;s perspective, and I think I&#39;ve
managed pretty well. I&#39;m still thinking of doing a
story after Conquest, too, but it&#39;s not coming any
time soon.
