<h1>Night Angels (part 15 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ecoldiron.html">Elwin Blain Coldiron</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/niteangel-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>Evening in Roanapur was like evening everyplace else - that is, if 
&#39;everyplace else&#39; just happens to be populated with every sort of 
criminal and cutthroat mercenary found. But as unusual as it is, there 
were decent people that lived on this corrupted island. So for those who 
didn&#39;t indulge in either pharmaceutical or carnal releases, they slept. 
Even some of the corrupted did the same.

In one particular hotel in one of the more stable of the island&#39;s 
districts, several guests managed to get their share of shut-eye. Deepak 
Vincent and William Collins had already had their meals and got 
themselves settled-in in their rooms. Becky &#39;the Nose&#39; Farrah lingered 
for a little bit longer, working on her laptop computer with reports she 
hoped to forward to Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing. But soon, 
even the red-haired information expert couldn&#39;t ignore the call to 
sleep, and soon put everything away and had gotten herself to bed.

But for Moria Hedgley, it was a different matter. Granted, because of an 
extended awake period, mostly to avoid jet lag - not to mention a rather 
&#39;personal&#39; problem - she had kept herself awake far longer than any 
human should normally do, and when she gotten herself undressed, she 
fell asleep just as soon as her head hit the pillow. But soon, the same 
dream that had plagued her for five other nights appeared; a night of 
lesbian passion with Irene &#39;Rally&#39; Vincent... followed by asking the 
vampire to drink her blood until she died.

It was while she was tossing about during this dream, Moria hands began 
to act on their own. While in her sleep, she pulled-up her shirt, 
exposing her full breasts. Then her right hand plunged into her panties, 
and while her left hand massaged her right breast, she began to 
masturbate herself with the other, the finger frantically rubbing her 
slit, the secretions from her vagina flowing around them.

&quot;Hmmm... yes... Rally... yes... AHHHHHHHHHH!!&quot; Suddenly, Moria 
ejaculated her panties as well as her fingers becoming drenched as she 
came. She paused for a few seconds, breathing heavy while still asleep. 
Then she shot up from the bed, her left hand going for her neck. &quot;WHA- 
WHAT!!&quot; Moria then examined her neck, finding it still unharmed, and 
then once again finding her right hand wet.

For a few minutes more, Moria just stared at her right hand, trying to 
comprehend what happened. Then her lower lip began to quiver as she fell 
back onto the pillows, tears streaming from her eyes. &quot;Oh why... why am 
I doing this?&quot; she sobbed. &quot;What does this mean? I cannot possibly have 
this desire to become a vampire! I simply cannot!&quot;

Moria just cried in her pillow for a few minutes, feeling so hateful of 
her actions. But as soon as she settled down, her ears caught the sound 
of a low moaning. Finally looking up from the pillow, she found that the 
sound was coming from the adjoining room, the one shared by Rally and 
Seras Victoria. Curious, she slowly crept on the carpeted floor, 
avoiding the swing that hung in her room, and made her way to the door 
between the rooms. Her door, like the door on the other side, was left 
open to allow her to see to the vampires&#39; needs as was her assignment. 
But when she peered inside, it was all she can do to keep yelping in 
surprise.

Both Rally and Seras were in their bed, both nude. Rally was kneeling 
behind her master, massaging her right breast with her left hand, while 
her right was busy fingering Seras&#39; crotch, wet sloshing sounds issuing 
forth. Seras&#39; face held a look of bliss, occasionally clenching as her 
servant brought her up to new heights of pleasure. &quot;Rally...&quot; she 
breathed, &quot;you&#39;re... uh... getting more talented every... uh... day!&quot;

Rally nuzzled the nape of her master&#39;s neck, her tongue causing Seras to 
shiver more. &quot;I just love to make my master happy, that&#39;s all,&quot; she 
replied in a low voice, her ministrations upon Seras&#39; clitoris 
increasing.

Moria began breathing heavily as she absently began to fondle her own 
right breast with her left hand. Absently striping what remained of her 
clothing, she began to masturbate herself again, still keeping sight of 
the two. But as she did, an unusual thing occurred - she imagined that 
Seras was absent and that SHE was the one Rally was making love to. 
Through lust-heated eyes, she saw herself moaning and convulsing with 
every movement Rally was making, bringing her closer and closer to 
orgasm.

It happened quickly. Seras came at the same time Moria did, the human 
girl biting her bottom lip hard to prevent herself from crying out, 
drawing blood as she did. At the same time, the brunette again 
ejaculated, her juices flooding over her thighs just as the Draculina 
did the same.

For a few seconds, all three girls paused, Rally watching her master as 
she recovered. Then a scent of blood wafted into her nostrils. Glancing 
discreetly, the dusky vampire was surprised to see Moria on the floor, 
apparently recovering from her passion. &#39;Master,&#39; Rally told Seras 
telepathically, &#39;I think Moria was... watching us!&#39;

Upon recovering, Seras used her &#39;third eye&#39; to observe Moira lying on 
the floor. &#39;I see. Well... let her watch, I say.&#39; Seras then turned 
around and drew Rally into a deep kiss, their tongues playing outside 
their mouths as the parted. &#39;I have no qualms about her voyeurism. In 
fact... I think she might learn a thing or two watching us make love.&#39; 
The two continued to kiss each other before Seras thought, &#39;So, are you 
game for a little... what is it that Americans call... &#39;sixty-nine&#39;? 
I&#39;ll let you be on top, Rally.&#39;

&#39;Master, you are so kind,&#39; Rally replied slyly. And with that, the dusky 
vampire rolled Seras on her back, then positioned herself until her head 
was over her master&#39;s crotch. Then diving down, Rally parted the 
Draculina&#39;s thighs and began to furiously lick Seras&#39; labia, sometimes 
plunging her tongue deeply into her master&#39;s vagina. Seras, at the same 
time, was doing the same with Rally, with both vampires moaning loudly 
as a result.

However, Moria looked with surprise, not at the vampires&#39; actions - but 
what she saw on Seras. The clitoral hood of the blonde vampire was 
apparently pierced, a metal ring with a red bead on it. &#39;That must be 
painful to be adorned in such a manner,&#39; the brunette thought to herself 
as she once again fingered herself in concert with her charges.

ANOTHER PART OF THE ISLAND...

Hueng could scarcely believe his eyes at the sight. Natasha Radinov had 
asked him if he had some storage facilities that she could use. The 
assassin paid him well, but even he could not comprehend the fact that 
she had led several zombie-like beings into it - one of them a woman. 
&quot;This... this... I cannot believe it!&quot; He then took another look at his 
old friend, this time scared out of his mind. &quot;Natasha... what in the 
world have you become?&quot; he gasped.

&quot;I&#39;ve had... sort of a problem on one of my assignments,&quot; Radinov 
replied. &quot;I was injured and my new employers healed me, but with a few 
additions, mind you.&quot; She then glanced over to Hueng, who was trembling. 
&quot;Do not worry, old friend,&quot; she reassured. &quot;I value our relationship far 
too much to even harm you.&quot;

&quot;If you say so, Natasha... but it is so unnerving,&quot; Hueng said, turning 
away.

That was when Radinov saw it - a huge bruise around his swollen eye. 
&quot;Still being pushed around, Hueng?&quot; she asked, shocked at the injury.

Hueng nodded. &quot;A couple of punks working for one of the minor groups 
working here.&quot; He slunk his shoulders down before adding, &quot;I never got 
this much hazing when Verrocchio was alive and I was one of his best 
fences, but Dago is not even concerned about my previous working 
relationship with his predecessor, just on his business.&quot;

&quot;Well, I cannot do anything about how Dago does business - but this 
rabble pushing you around is something I will NOT forgive!&quot; Radinov 
looked at two of the ghouls she created, who responded to her mental 
summons. &quot;I need you to show me where these bullies are - then I will 
deal with them,&quot; she said. Then looking to Hueng, she added, &quot;who knows 
- maybe after my mission, I could arrange for my employers to equip you 
to be the same as me.&quot;

&quot;The same as... you?&quot; asked Hueng.

Radinov smiled. &quot;Yes... and then you will NEVER be pushed around again! 
You can even run this island if you like.&quot;

&quot;Now that would be something,&quot; Hueng remarked, smiling. &quot;Maybe I can 
even replace that fry-faced bitch Balalaika.&quot;

&quot;One can hope,&quot; remarked Radinov.

XXX

A group of Thai men, obviously members of one of the minor criminal 
gangs on the island, gathered inside a deserted warehouse, going over 
their latest shipment of opium smuggled from Afghanistan, to be 
processed into heroin. Between their drinking of beer and idle talk, 
they didn&#39;t interrupt their work... until the door behind them opened. 
Immedietly, all of them dropped what they were doing and drew various 
machine guns, prepared for a raid. But they all relaxed when a single 
man entered.

&quot;Well what do you know,&quot; one of them smirked, &quot;it&#39;s that loser 
&#39;Hard-Luck&#39; Hueng, ready for another ass kicking!&quot; The other men then 
broke-out into hysterical laughter.

&quot;Laugh all you want, you assholes!&quot; Hueng shot back. &quot;You guys are not 
going to be pushing me around anymore!&quot;

&quot;Oh sure, make your big speeches as usual,&quot; another scoffed, stepping up 
to the slightly-built man. &quot;Granted, you may have been big stuff when 
you worked for Verrocchio, but now that he&#39;s dead, you&#39;re nothing but 
old news. Even his replacement Dago doesn&#39;t want to have anything to do 
for you.&quot; He then grabbed Hueng by the shirt, &quot;Now just hold still and 
MAYBE this ass-kicking won&#39;t hurt as much!&quot;

&quot;That is quite enough, thank you,&quot; Radinov interrupted, stepping out of 
the doorway and in-between her friend. &quot;Hueng is quite right, gentlemen. 
It is time that you are all shown a lesson - one which will be your 
last!&quot;

The man threatening Hueng stepped back, then joined his fellow. &quot;Natasha 
Radinov?&quot; the first one said. &quot;We&#39;ve heard rumors that you were dead!&quot;

&quot;You could say that,&quot; the assassin said, taking off her bulletproof 
coat. &quot;In fact, before you meet your fate, I&#39;ll let you shoot first.&quot; 
She then handed the coat to Hueng, saying quietly, &quot;Cover yourself with 
this.&quot;

&quot;But Natasha,&quot; Hueng countered, &quot;you&#39;ll be helpless without your coat!&quot;

&quot;Just watch, friend... and see the power you&#39;ll soon receive,&quot; Radinov 
reassured. Once confident her friend was protected, she stepped up to 
the group, proclaiming, &quot;Go ahead - shoot me!&quot;

The group didn&#39;t hesitate. As one, they opened fire on Radinov, riddling 
the assassin with countless shots. Hueng, under her coat, could only 
look in horror as his friend took the shots. However, as soon as they 
stopped firing, everyone could only gape as Radinov still stood.

&quot;I don&#39;t get it,&quot; one of them said, scratching his stubbled chin. &quot;She 
should&#39;ve fallen down with all that lead in her.&quot;

&quot;H-h-hey guys... LOOK!!&quot; Their eyes - and Hueng&#39;s - widened as the 
wounds Radinov suffered began to heal, disappearing in less than ten 
seconds.

Radinov&#39;s head finally craned upward, the headshot she suffered healing 
as it did. &quot;If you thought that was something,&quot; she smirked, displaying 
her fangs, &quot;you&#39;ll REALLY get a kick out of this one!&quot; She then shot 
across the floor and grabbed one of the men, sinking her fangs into his 
neck.

The remaining gang looked in horror as Radinov fed upon their fellow. 
Then dropping the bloodless corpse, the FREAK turned around and called 
out, &quot;Hueng, open the car door and allow our other friends in to join 
the party!&quot;

Complying, the slight man pressed a button on the wall, the carport door 
opening to reveal three ghouls waiting outside. They then shambled 
inside, causing the remaining men to open fire on them. But no matter 
how many shots they fired, the ghouls still advanced, grabbing some of 
them and tearing some to pieces, the others biting them to death.

Radinov then grabbed another of the group that tried to flee, turning to 
her friend. &quot;This is the power I will give you once my mission is 
finished, Hueng!&quot; she called out, seeing her friend smile. &quot;And once you 
have it, this island - maybe all of Asia - will be yours for the 
taking!&quot; She then sank her fangs into her victim, draining him of his 
life.

Hueng smiled wickedly, &quot;Yes... ALL of Asia!&quot; He then saw that, of the 
men that were not being eaten by the ghouls were rising as ghouls 
themselves, as well as Radinov&#39;s victims. Indeed, the power he would 
receive from his friend would be a great gift!

A SECRET LOCATION, SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH AMERICA...

However, what the two didn&#39;t know was that, Radinov&#39;s actions were being 
monitored as they spoke. &quot;So far, so good,&quot; the Major observed, 
watching, along with his inner circle of Millennium - the Doctor, the 
Captain, Zorin Blitz, Rip Van Winkle, Tubalcain Alhambra and Schr&#148;dinger 
- the carnage unfolding. &quot;Radinov is exceeding even our greatest 
expectations.&quot; Next to the Major, the Captain nodded, giving his silent 
approval.

&quot;Ja, I have to agree,&quot; Zorin added, the tattooed woman nodding in turn. 
&quot;The closest thing to a true vampire. Your plan vill greatly benefit 
from this.&quot;

&quot;But still,&quot; Rip countered, her grip nearly crushing her yellow parasol, 
&quot;Ve had to give the prototype chip to that Slav pig. It&#39;s so... so... 
galling!&quot;

&quot;Oh I vouldn&#39;t vorry to much, Rippy,&quot; Schr&#148;dinger chirped, the catboy 
seated at the Major&#39;s feet. &quot;After all, this is just a test of the chip. 
And once Dok gets the other back, ve can make more of them. But if it 
doesn&#39;t vork,&quot; he shrugged his shoulders, &quot;no big loss, she&#39;ll be gone.&quot;

&quot;Von can only hope,&quot; Rip said, relaxing her grip on the parasol.

However, the Doctor just stood there silently, wringing his hands in 
worry. &quot;But if ve loose the chip,&quot; he whimpered, &quot;it vill set me back 
thousands of hours of vork! It has GOT to vork, it has to!&quot;

The Major just glanced over at the trembling Doctor. &quot;Try not to let 
this vorry you too much, heir Doctor,&quot; he said casually, taking up his 
cup of chocolate-flavored coffee from a nearby table. &quot;Ve still have 
enough of our original chips... and more than enough loyal followers - 
FREAK and human - to set our plans into motion.&quot;

&quot;And once that happens,&quot; Alhambra added, fumbling a playing card in his 
hands, &quot;the might of Millennium will set this world on fire!&quot; He then 
flicked the card at a nearby statuette, cleaving it neatly in half.

The Major sighed. &quot;Really, Dandy Man,&quot; he grumbled, &quot;you should be 
grateful that you only cut the cheap statues with your damned cards.&quot;

ROANPUR, MORNING...

The ringing of the telephone was what awoke Moria from her sleep. Still 
nude, she got herself off the floor and wandered to the phone. &quot;Yes,&quot; 
she mumbled.

&quot;Hey girlfriend,&quot; Becky&#39;s voice chirped over the other end, &quot;just wanted 
you to know you&#39;re invited for breakfast downstairs.&quot;

&quot;Oh, y-yes, just let me get cleaned-up and check on Rally and Seras 
first,&quot; the maid said, finally clearing her head. &quot;I&#39;ll see you in a 
half an hour.&quot; Setting down the phone, she quickly made her way to the 
shower.

As she cleaned herself up, she took time to take stock of last night 
events. &#39;I have to admit, I even shocked myself,&#39; she thought to 
herself. &#39;But at least afterward, that dream didn&#39;t return. I guess it 
must be a lot of sexual tension I had, fantasizing about Rally and all 
that.&#39; Once finished, she dried herself, quickly brushed her hair, then 
dressed herself casually. She then made her way to the other room to 
check on Rally and Seras.

Both vampires were deeply asleep, although they didn&#39;t bother to cover 
themselves. Their inner thighs were still glistening from their 
secretions coming from their shaven crotches, obviously they continued 
pleasuring themselves and each other until sunrise. &#39;Well, I&#39;m not 
surprised, the way they were going at it.&#39;

As she prepared to cover the two up, Moria just happened to glance down 
at Rally and was surprised that the dusky vampire had a clitoris ring 
similar to what she saw on Seras, as well as two golden rings on each 
side of her labia. &#39;I didn&#39;t really think Rally was the type of person 
that would have such adornments!&#39; she thought, then smiled and added, 
&#39;They are quite lovely, though.&#39;

As soon as she was satisfied that both vampires were modestly covered, 
Moria bent over to Rally&#39;s face. &quot;I cannot wait until we have a chance, 
my lovely,&quot; she whispered, kissing Rally lightly on the lips. Then as an 
afterthought, she grabbed-up the &#39;do not disturb&#39; sign from the table 
near the hallway door and placed it on the outside knob. Making sure the 
door was securely locked - which meant adding additional securement they 
brought, Moria exited through her own room and preceded downstairs.

As soon as she stepped out of the elevator, Moria made her way to the 
restaurant. Once inside, she quickly made her way to the table which 
Becky, Collins and Vincent sat. &quot;Well, it&#39;s about time you arrived,&quot; 
Collins playfully remarked. Then his tone changed, &quot;Sorry to say this, 
but I&#39;m afraid you, Rally and Seras are stuck in those rooms for the 
duration of this little trip.&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s alright, Bill,&quot; Moria said. &quot;Anyway, how were all your 
nights?&quot;

&quot;Slept like a rock,&quot; Becky said, &quot;although I did wake up to go to the 
bathroom, only to hear Rally and Seras going at it. Guess the people who 
built this place didn&#39;t take into account sound insulation.&quot;

&quot;Or possibly the money for such was lost due to kickbacks,&quot; Vincent 
added.

Then Becky had an odd look on her face. &quot;Anything happened to you, 
Moria?&quot; she asked. &quot;You look like you&#39;ve cut your lip.&quot;

Moria then remembered the place she bit herself. &quot;Oh that?&quot; she 
blundered, trying to make up a story. &quot;Well... just before I went to 
bed, I turned on the telly and found the most... engaging movie I&#39;ve 
ever seen! Guess I got so nervous I bit myself.&quot;

&quot;Uh... right,&quot; Becky muttered, wondering if the brunette was listening 
in on Rally and Seras&#39; activities. Then something caught her attention. 
&quot;Oh my, I wonder what happened to her?&quot; She pointed out a woman - the 
crimelord Balalaika - as she entered the restaurant and was greeted by 
the hotel&#39;s manager. &quot;She looks like she got burned or something.&quot;

&quot;Everyone... try not to look too hard at her!&quot; Vincent hastily 
whispered, causing the others to quickly avert their eyes. &quot;We don&#39;t 
want to cause her to suspect us!&quot; The group then forced their attentions 
to themselves, although it was a bit hard not to look at the scarred, 
but still beautiful woman.

It was a little while before Balalaika, along with her second-in-command 
Boris, accompanied the manager to another part of the area. &quot;Okay, so 
what&#39;s going on with that woman?&quot; Becky hissed.

&quot;Did you get a look of that coat she was wearing?&quot; Vincent asked.

&quot;I sure did,&quot; Collins said. &quot;Looked like an old Red Army coat, with 
quite a bit of decoration on her &#39;fruit salad&#39;. Couldn&#39;t tell what 
division, though.&quot;

&quot;From the looks of it, possibly a paratrooper,&quot; Vincent added, then 
thought for a while before continuing. &quot;You know, I&#39;ve heard mention of 
a specific division within the Red Army&#39;s paratrooper division - the 
Desantniki, also known as &#39;the Tigers of the Khyber Pass&#39;. As special 
forces go, the Desantniki were one of the best, if not the best. The 
soldiers who fought in that group were rigorously trained and highly 
motivated. They were more than a match to the various groups of 
Mujahideen they encountered - and the most remarkable thing is that 
their commanding officer was a woman - a blonde, in fact!&quot;

Becky looked incredulous. &quot;You mean to say that woman could have been 
the commander of that division?&quot;

Vincent nodded. &quot;Her code name was &#39;Balalaika&#39;, after the Russian 
musical instrument; NATO couldn&#39;t get her real name. But from what they 
were able to gather about her, she was known as a tough, ruthless 
commander, who wouldn&#39;t hesitate to wipe-out an entire Afghan village if 
even one member of her platoon was ever injured or killed by a member. 
And she always looked after her men, for which they gave her their 
undying loyalty.&quot;

Then Moria asked a question, &quot;Whatever happened to this... Balalaika and 
her division.&quot;

&quot;The Desantniki were disbanded by the Russians not long after they got 
their butts kicked in Afghanistan,&quot; Vincent answered. &quot;She and a good 
number of her former troops disappeared not long after that. She was a 
real legend among the Red Army, and it was rumored that they had quite a 
few desertions after she left.&quot;

&quot;And now it looks like she&#39;s set-up shop here on Roanapur,&quot; Collins 
said. &quot;We better watch ourselves, no telling who else we might meet 
here.&quot;

&quot;Point taken, Bill, but I&#39;ve got some shopping to do while I&#39;m here,&quot; 
Becky said, smiling.

&quot;Are you sure that&#39;s a good idea?&quot; Vincent remarked. &quot;There&#39;s no telling 
what you&#39;ll get, not to mention you might be buying stolen merchandise.&quot;

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve considered that angle already!&quot; And with that, 
Becky produced a list, possibly from a computer, the title &quot;Legitimate 
retailers on Roanapur&quot; on it. &quot;The information&#39;s there if you look for 
it.&quot; Becky then looked to Moria and asked, &quot;Care to join me?&quot;

&quot;Love to, but I better stay close to the motel to look out for Rally and 
Seras,&quot; Moria said. &quot;Besides, I dread to think what may happen if the 
rooms end-up getting burgled and no one is there.&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;m certain Irene and Seras can take care of themselves,&quot; Vincent 
said. &quot;After all, it&#39;s not like they don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening around 
them while they&#39;re sleeping.&quot;

&quot;Pardon?&quot; Moria asked.

Vincent then went on to say, &quot;Vampires are always aware of their 
surroundings, even while asleep. Sir Arthur told me that little fact 
some years back. They see and hear everything, which can fool even the 
most observant of vampire hunters.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Moria squeaked, her face blushing furiously.

&quot;Anything wrong?&quot; Becky asked, noticing.

&quot;HU-WHAT?&quot; Moria then forced herself to be calm. &quot;Uhhh... I... think 
I&#39;ll tell you later.&quot; She then mentally bawled herself out. &#39;Moria, you 
bloody idiot! That means that Rally knew I kissed her! How in the world 
am I going to explain it to her!?&#39; She was then brought out of her 
thoughts by the sound of her cellphone ringing. &quot;Yes?&quot; she said, 
switching it on. &quot;Oh, sure Sir Integra.&quot; She then handed the phone to 
Vincent. &quot;You should hear this.&quot;

Vincent then took the phone. &quot;You want something, Sir Integra?&quot;

A PRIVATE JET SOMEWHERE OVER THE INDIAN OCEAN...

Pip Bernadotte exited the cockpit where he was consulting with the 
pilot. &quot;We should be landing in about two hours, ze pilot told me,&quot; he 
said to Sir Integra.

The leader of the Hellsing Organization nodded, then said over the 
phone. &quot;Mr. Vincent, I should inform you that myself and Captain 
Bernadotte will be landing within two hours. I would like to have 
transportation ready when we arrive.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be there personally to take you there,&quot; Vincent&#39;s 
voice replied.

&quot;You do that. I will see you then.&quot; She then hung up and looked over at 
the one-eyed mercenary. &quot;Hopefully we can have this resolved while 
avoiding bloodshed... but we must be prepared for the worse 
nonetheless.&quot;

&quot;Oui,&quot; Pip agreed. &quot;But I hope Rally and Mignonette can recover ze chip 
without firing a shot.. or our interference.&quot;

&quot;It would be a miracle if that was accomplished,&quot; Sir Integra sighed.

ROANAPUR...

&quot;Sorry, but I&#39;m going to have to get over to the mainland,&quot; Vincent 
said, keeping an eye on Balalaika&#39;s party, who was leaving the 
restaurant. &quot;Sir Integra&#39;s going to be landing in about two hours and 
needs a ride up.&quot;

&quot;You do that,&quot; Collins said, &quot;I&#39;m going to look around more of the 
island, try to find out where we&#39;ll find the Lagoon Company.&quot; He looked 
over to the girls and added, &quot;And you two keep an eye on your 
surroundings.&quot;

&quot;Will do, Bill,&quot; Becky said jauntingly.

&quot;And please be careful,&quot; added Moria.

XXX

As their limousine made their way from the hotel, Balalaika took some 
time to light-up a cigar, while Boris gone over the latest figures for 
the month. &quot;Sergeant,&quot; she began, taking a puff, &quot;did you happen to see 
that darker-skinned man in that party of four.&quot;

&quot;Not really, Captain,&quot; Boris remarked.

&quot;Well I did. He is Deepak Vincent, born in the United States of 
Indian-Pakistani parentage. Former U.S. Army, former Green Beret, and an 
Olympic gold medalist in target shooting.&quot;

&quot;Now that you mentioned it,&quot; Boris remarked, &quot;the party did take notice 
of us when we arrived. But why did you notice him in particular?&quot;

Balalaika smiled as she turned to her second. &quot;Deepak Vincent is also a 
widower, his British wife shot to death in front of the gun store he 
owned while serving divorce papers. Mrs. Vincent, while she loved her 
husband with all her heart, hated guns and wanted to protect their 
daughter from their influence.&quot;

&quot;Daughter?&quot; Boris asked.

&quot;Yes - Irene &quot;Rally&quot; Vincent, who would later become the gun store&#39;s 
owner - and who would later sell the store when she became a member of 
the Hellsing Organization!&quot;

Boris looked alarmed. &quot;So the Hellsing Organization is here?&quot;

&quot;Maybe. It could possibly be an advance party, but Dutch should be told 
nonetheless.&quot; Balalaika&#39;s brow then furrowed. &quot;However, I&#39;m still 
bothered by the name of that organization. Where in the world have I 
heard the name &#39;Hellsing&#39; before.&quot;

&quot;I had that same problem too, Captain,&quot; Boris began, &quot;but then last 
night, I decided to pick-up a book to read - and there it was, albeit 
spelled differently.&quot; He presented a book he had with him to her.

Balalaika looked at the cover. &quot;It&#39;s in English,&quot; she observed.

&quot;Yes, one of the few I have in that language. Please Captain, go to the 
page I have marked and you see what I&#39;ve discovered.&quot;

The scarred crimelord then took the book from Boris and turned it to the 
page indicated. She then read the passage and her brow furrowed. &quot;So 
that&#39;s where I&#39;ve heard that name! But is that possible?&quot; she mused.

&quot;I find it doubtful,&quot; Boris added, &quot;but the coincidence cannot be 
ignored.&quot; He then added, &quot;Should we tell the Lagoon Company of our 
findings?&quot;

&quot;I am not certain that Dutch would believe it even if I told him,&quot; 
Balalaika said. &quot;However, it does warrant further research. As soon as 
we return to Hotel Moscow, I will consider the matter.&quot; She then handed 
the book back to Boris - the title read &#39;Dracula, by Bram Stoker&#39;.

THE HOTEL, LATE AFTERNOON...

Despite her misgivings to the contrary, Moria decided to take-up Becky&#39;s 
invitation to go shopping anyway, hoping to ease any lingering stress 
issues she had. Taking advantage of the list the information expert had 
researched, the two went to many of the more reputable shops listed. Of 
course, Becky&#39;s choices tended to lean closer to all the electronic 
stores around, and she was able to find quite a few choices of hardware 
she was looking for, and at good prices. However, Moria had looked at 
the time and excused herself to return to the hotel, knowing that the 
vampires were strong enough to be out and about with the late sunlight.

She had a lot on her mind about her duties as she made her way to her 
room: check on Rally and Seras, make sure their blood rations were ready 
and getting ready for the night. But as she entered her room, Moria was 
surprised to hear the shower in the adjoining room running - as well as 
the sounds of moaning.

It was all that Moria can do to avoid dropping her purchases in shock. 
&#39;I don&#39;t believe those two!&#39; she thought, aghast, &#39;they were shagging 
practically all night, and the minute they hit the shower they&#39;re at it 
again! I swear those girls&#39; libidos must be on overdrive!&#39; However, just 
from hearing all that moaning caused Moria to almost instinctively start 
fondling herself. Sliding down the wall outside, Moria began to rub and 
squeeze her right breast with her left hand, at the same time beginning 
to rub herself through her pants.

But rather abruptly, the moaning in the shower died down, followed by 
Rally muttering, &quot;Oh crap.&quot; Then loudly, she called-out, &quot;HEY MORIA, YOU 
OUT THERE?&quot;

&quot;EEEP!!&quot; Rather quickly, Moria stopped herself, then answered, &quot;Uh... 
yes Rally. What do you want?&quot;

&quot;Moria, we seemed to have forgotten to bring the shower gel,&quot; said 
Rally. &quot;Could you go into the suitcases to get it?&quot;

&quot;S-sure, why not?&quot; Moria then got herself off the floor and rushed to 
the suitcases the vampires brought with them. Then finding the 
particular item, she made her way to the bathroom. &quot;Here it is, but I&#39;m 
not certain why you asked me to get it rather than... ACK!!&quot;

Rally had parted the shower curtain, stark naked with Seras close by. 
&quot;Well... how am I going to say this... me and Master were rather eager 
to get showered-up, but we kinda gotten a little... well, you know, 
and...&quot;

&quot;N-nevermind,&quot; the maid stammered, handing Rally the shower gel. &quot;I... I 
better go back to my room and see to your rations.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Rally answered, then seeing Moria head off.

It only took a few minutes for Moria to set-up a portable bucket, where 
she placed two units of blood on ice. While preparing for the briefing 
to follow, Rally and Seras had entered the room, both dressed in towels. 
&quot;Moria,&quot; Rally began, &quot;there&#39;s something we have to talk about.&quot;

Moria paused. &quot;You know I kissed you this morning, don&#39;t you?&quot; she said 
glumly.

&quot;Well, yes. That and...&quot; Rally paused for a bit, &quot;me and Master know you 
were watching us make love last night.&quot;

&#39;Oh no!&#39; Moria slowly turned around, a tear rolling down her eye. 
&quot;Please, don&#39;t be angry with me!&quot; she pleaded. &quot;It was just that... both 
of you were making so much noise, and that...&quot; It was when she looked up 
that she discovered that the vampires were smiling at her.

&quot;Moria, we&#39;re not angry,&quot; Seras giggled, bringing a look of relief upon 
the maid&#39;s face. &quot;In fact, we were rather flattered that you were 
interested in us. The only thing we were disappointed with is that... 
well... you didn&#39;t come in and join us.&quot;

&quot;Huh? Oh... yes, thank you.&quot; Moria breathed a sigh and thought, &#39;That 
was a relief. Really, Moria, you worry yourself too much.&#39;

&quot;Rally, we better get dressed,&quot; Seras said. &quot;Agent Collins should be 
back with what he discovered.&quot;

&quot;Right, Master,&quot; Rally replied, and went to join Seras when she felt a 
hand upon her shoulder. &quot;What is it, Moria?&quot;

&quot;Rally,&quot; Moria began, &quot;there was something I wished to discuss with you 
before we left London but you were already sealed-up beforehand...&quot;

&quot;Look, this can wait, can it?&quot;

Moria thought for a while. &quot;I guess,&quot; she said.

&quot;Good.&quot; Rally then leaned over and gave Moria a small kiss. &quot;I&#39;m certain 
is nothing, so I wouldn&#39;t worry about it much.&quot;

&quot;I guess,&quot; Moria said. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll have your rations ready as soon as 
you&#39;re dressed.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; replied Rally, but then thought to herself, &#39;My lovely.&#39;

ANOTHER PART OF TOWN...

In Becky&#39;s mind, her shopping excursion had been quite successful, as 
she was able to obtain all the items on her list. Granted, some of the 
reputable dealers on the island tried to jack-up the listed prices of 
the electronic components she was looking for, but with clever 
negotiation, she managed to dicker-down their asking prices to something 
she could reasonably afford.

So to reward herself, she found a street side restaurant so that she 
could sample the local fare. Thankfully, the person who passed as a 
waiter knew English enough to translate the menu. After what was an 
impossibly-long wait, a steaming hot bowl was presented in front of her.

But upon looking into the bowl, Becky wondered if whatever she ordered 
was edible; it looked as if the cook had fished through a garbage dump 
for the ingredients. It smelled delicious though, she reasoned, so she 
thought she might as well try it.

However, just as Becky was about to dig in, several voices caught her 
attention. &quot;Oh don&#39;t give me that guff, Rock,&quot; a female voice snarled, 
&quot;It can&#39;t be that hard to get that gun!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll just give it to you, Revy, that&#39;s all!&quot; a male 
voice pleaded.

Nervous, Becky took a side glance to the source of the noise - and it 
felt like her blood froze. She recognized the forms of Revy and Rokuro 
Okajima walking down the street. &quot;I don&#39;t care if this Rally Vincent 
gives me that gun - like I said before, all I have to do is put a bullet 
between her eyes and it&#39;s mine!&quot;

&#39;I don&#39;t understand?&#39; Becky managed to think to herself, &#39;How in the 
world does that... that woman know about Rally? As soon as I get back to 
the hotel, I&#39;d better warn her!&#39; She continued to follow the two 
discreetly as they walked behind her down the street. When she felt 
reasonably sure they were gone, she let out the breath she held, then 
settled down to enjoy her meal.

But before she could get the first bite to her mouth, Becky felt a 
tapping on her shoulder. &quot;Yes,&quot; she grumbled, &quot;what is it you want, I&#39;m 
trying to... oh my god!&quot; Staring her in the eye was Revy - who had a 
suspicious look on her face.

&quot;Pardon me, but I don&#39;t recall seeing your face around here,&quot; the 
Chinese girl said in a low, threatening voice. &quot;You just arrived?&quot; Becky 
could only nod, her voice seemingly paralyzed in fear.

&quot;Revy, what in the world are you doing?&quot; Rock pleaded from behind her, 
but got only a wave on the hand, her glare never wavering.

Revy continued to stare at Becky for about thirty seconds, but from the 
information expert&#39;s perspective, it seemed like an hour. Finally 
satisfied that she wasn&#39;t a threat, Revy grunted and said, &quot;My advice to 
you... I wouldn&#39;t be walking around these parts without packing any 
heat. You&#39;ll live longer if you do. Got it?&quot;

&quot;Y-y-yes,&quot; Becky finally whimpered.

Revy then stood up, glanced over at the bowl in front of Becky and 
added, &quot;Oh, and I wouldn&#39;t eat that shit if I were you. From what I&#39;ve 
heard, the cook&#39;s got dysentery and doesn&#39;t wash his hands.&quot; She then 
walked away with Rock, adding, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t want to have the Hershey 
Squirts for a week, y&#39;know.&quot;

For the next two minutes, Becky just sat at her seat, willing her heart 
to stop beating at the rate it was going. She then got up unsteadily, 
grabbed her purchases and ran for the hotel.

YET ANOTHER PART OF TOWN, EARLY EVENING...

Hueng could only look with relief when Radinov had closed the door of 
the delivery truck he was able to wrangle, sealing the ghouls inside. &quot;I 
have to admit,&quot; he said, &quot;even those you didn&#39;t drink blood from, the 
victims of these zombie things you&#39;ve created became zombies 
themselves.&quot; He turned to his friend and asked, &quot;Just what are you going 
to do with these things anyway?&quot;

Radinov surveyed the truck with a look of self-satisfaction and replied, 
&quot;You could say that I plan to use them as... cannon fodder. True they 
appear very strong and tenacious, but they&#39;re way too slow to be truly 
effective soldiers. So what I have planned for them is to use them 
against whoever possesses the chip I&#39;m looking for.&quot;

&quot;If you say so,&quot; Hueng replied. He then handed what appeared to be a 
bento to Radinov. &quot;Oh, and about this... I figured that, since you&#39;re a 
vampire now, you wouldn&#39;t need regular food anymore. Why in the world 
did you ask me to cook up this?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the true beauty of this chip,&quot; Radinov said, opening the box up 
and partaking of the contents. &quot;True I must consume blood to survive, 
but at least the design of this chip allow me to... indulge in mortal 
pleasures.&quot; She took another bite and added, &quot;Hueng, your cooking is 
STILL the best!&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Natasha,&quot; the slight man said, bowing. &quot;So, what do you plan 
to do tonight?&quot;

Radinov hesitated for a bit before replying. &quot;I plan to stake-out the 
Yellow Flag Bar for a bit. If I am not mistaken, whoever stolen the 
other chip might come to this place to unwind - and hopefully, I can 
follow them to where the chip is.&quot;

&quot;Well I won&#39;t get into your way, then,&quot; Hueng said. &quot;Let me know if you 
need anything else while you&#39;re here, okay Natasha?&quot;

&quot;I will do that, my friend,&quot; Radinov said, entering the truck&#39;s cab. 
However, before she fired-up the engine, she took some time to think 
about her benefactors a bit.

During her tenure with the K.G.B., Radinov&#39;s experience and results had 
landed her a unique place within the agency - namely unprecedented 
access to much of the classified files there, which would include the 
K.G.B.&#39;s predecessor, the Stalin-era N.K.V.D.. History was a minor 
interest she had and wanted to learn much about some of the history of 
the agency. It was while studying some of the files made during the 
Great Patriotic War, what the western world referred to as World War II, 
that she found an interesting story.

After the Nazis had abandoned Warsaw after putting down the uprising in 
the Jewish Ghetto there in early 1945, a unit of the Red Army came 
across what appeared to be a destroyed laboratory. After capturing and 
brutally interrogating surviving Wehrmacht soldiers outside the city, 
the N.K.V.D. discovered that there was a secret S.S. society there, 
under direct orders from Adolph Hitler. It seemed that the Nazis were 
somehow interested in vampires, and were working to create artificial 
vampires in order to reinforce and maintain the empire the Germans had 
established within the mainland of Europe. However, during the uprising, 
two individuals had sneaked-in and destroyed the work there, improbable 
as it sounded - a teenaged boy and a young Asian girl. However, all 
records were destroyed during the attack but there was evidence that the 
chief scientist - who was a polydactyl, a defect strangely allowed 
within the perfectionist climate of Nazi Germany - had disappeared.

&#39;I wonder,&#39; Radinov thought to herself, &#39;impossible as it might seem... 
could that scientist that worked on that project... be the scientist 
that saved me?&#39;

THE HOTEL, AT THE SAME TIME...

&quot;Okay, so let me get this straight,&quot; Rally asked Collins, &quot;the best 
place to start looking for this... Lagoon Company is this bar?&quot; Both 
Rally and Seras were dressed in casual clothing; there was nothing they 
wore that identified them as agents of the Hellsing Organization.

&quot;Right,&quot; Collins replied, trying not to meet Rally&#39;s gaze. &quot;The Yellow 
Flag Bar was established around the time South Vietnam fell to the 
north.&quot; He produced what appeared to be an old photograph attached to a 
file. &quot;The guy that owns it, Bao, used to be an officer in the South 
Vietnamese army.&quot;

&quot;I would imagine the bar&#39;s name is a reference to the flag of South 
Vietnam,&quot; Seras observed.

Collins nodded. &quot;Most of the clientele that frequents the bar just 
happens to be the worst of this island: pirates, criminals, prostitutes 
and the like. If you two happen to go there, you&#39;re likely to stick-out 
like a sore thumb.&quot;

&quot;Sorry Bill, but me and Master aren&#39;t going to dress trashy just because 
it might be safer,&quot; Rally said. Then she noticed Collins&#39; evasiveness. 
&quot;Anything wrong? You&#39;re not looking me in the eye.&quot;

&quot;Uh... yeah. Rally, don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but looking you and 
Seras in the eye is... well... creepy,&quot; the agent said. &quot;I don&#39;t think I 
can ever get used to you with those red eyes.&quot;

&quot;Oh is that it?&quot; Rally laughed. &quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll be a problem, 
right Master?&quot;

&quot;I happen to agree, Rally,&quot; Seras added, also giggling.

Sighing, Collins decided to muster up his courage to make his statement 
to the contrary - and was nearly blown away with what he saw! Rally&#39;s 
eyes were transformed, now showing their old blue hue. He frantically 
turned to Seras, only to find her eyes blue too! &quot;R-R-Rally?&quot; he 
sputtered, &quot;how... how...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m amazed, too,&quot; Moria added, who was seated next to the vampires 
after serving their blood rations to them. &quot;How did you and Seras do 
that?&quot;

&quot;Oh this?&quot; Rally said. &quot;Alucard showed us how to do this last week. He 
said it was just a minor transformation that some vampires used, mostly 
as a hunting trait to lure humans into a false sense of security.&quot;

&quot;Master figured that me and Rally could use it to blend-in more with our 
surroundings whenever we go on a mission,&quot; added Seras. &quot;You have to 
admit, it would cause people to question us if we wore our sunglasses at 
night.&quot;

&quot;I guess, and thanks Rally,&quot; Collins chuckled. &quot;Now back to this bar... 
from what I&#39;ve been able to gather, this place is prone to a lot of 
gunfights, so I would advise you to come armed in case things gotten a 
little hairy.&quot;

&quot;Quite a bit of gunfights?&quot; Seras offered.

Collins nodded. &quot;A lot, and from what I found, the place was once blown 
up - believe it or not, by a maid.&quot;

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t look at me,&quot; Moria said in her defense.

&quot;Sounds like a lively place,&quot; Rally chuckled. &quot;Okay Bill, we&#39;ll make 
sure to be armed when we get there and...&quot; Suddenly, the dusky vampire&#39;s 
voice trailed-off, as if hearing something. &quot;Master... do you sense 
that?&quot;

Seras nodded. &quot;I do, Rally... fear, and a great amount of it, from what 
I&#39;ve been able to gather.&quot;

Quickly, Rally got up from her seat and went to the door. Opening it, 
she was surprised to see Becky standing there, wide-eyed and in a cold 
sweat. &quot;Becky, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked, concerned about her friend&#39;s 
state.

As soon as she was able to walk inside, Becky dropped the bags she was 
carrying. &quot;Rally...&quot; she muttered before falling into her friend&#39;s arms.

&quot;BECKY!! BILL, GET A WASHCLOTH OVER HERE!!&quot; Rally called-out as she 
gathered up Becky and carried her to Moria&#39;s bed. Not asking questions, 
Collins raced into the bathroom to wet a washcloth and wring it out. He 
then got it over to Rally, who began to dab her friend&#39;s forehead.

&quot;Is she alright?&quot; Moria asked, concerned.

&quot;Yeah, she just fainted, that&#39;s all,&quot; Rally sighed. &quot;Look, she&#39;s coming 
around! Maybe we&#39;ll find out what happened.&quot;

Of course, Rally didn&#39;t expect Becky to suddenly wrap her arms around 
her once she regained consciousness. &quot;Oh Rally!&quot; she whimpered. &quot;I... I 
saw her! We were face-to-face back there! I... I thought I was going to 
be killed back there!&quot;

&quot;Saw who? Becky, what did you saw?&quot; Rally demanded, only to find that 
Becky was having trouble forming words. Quickly deciding, she forced 
contact of her&#39;s and Becky&#39;s foreheads. Concentrating, Rally searched 
through Becky&#39;s most recent thoughts, but got mostly clutter, possibly 
because of the information expert&#39;s state of mind. Then a clear picture 
came through the jumbled images - namely Revy&#39;s face staring at Becky!

&quot;It&#39;s her!&quot; Rally snarled, her eyes once again resuming their orange-red 
color. Calming herself, she forced eye contact with Becky, her eyes 
gently glowing. &quot;Becky, you&#39;re going to take a small nap. When you wake 
up, your fear will be gone and you&#39;ll be the same old Becky I know.&quot;

&quot;Uh... yeah Rally,&quot; Becky mumbled sleepily, the vampire gently easing 
her on the bed.

For a few minutes after she stood up, Rally was quiet. However, everyone 
could see her tightly-clenched fists shaking violently. &quot;Rally, I hope 
you&#39;re not going to do what I think you&#39;re doing,&quot; Seras offered.

Then Rally turned around, her face showing barely-controlled rage. 
&quot;Bill, look after Becky,&quot; she finally said. &quot;When Dad and Sir Integra 
get here, tell them to head for this bar you&#39;ve told us about!&quot;

&quot;Rally, you&#39;re not going to face-off against that woman?&quot; Seras asked.

&quot;It could be dangerous,&quot; Moria added.

&quot;I don&#39;t care!&quot; Rally snapped, her eyes glowing brilliantly. &quot;That bitch 
scared Becky for no reason whatsoever! Whatever it takes, I&#39;m going to 
make her pay!&quot;

THE LAGOON COMPANY, AT THE SAME TIME...

&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me, Dutch?&quot; Benny gasped, alarmed at the 
revelation he and the rest of the group just heard.

&quot;I wish I was, Benny-boy,&quot; the African American said, seated at one of 
the two couches that faced each other, &quot;but the information Balalaika 
told me over the phone is so incredible I&#39;m finding it hard to believe 
myself!&quot;

&quot;This is crazy,&quot; Rock said, seated next to Revy, &quot;that woman a relative 
of an old vampire hunter?&quot;

&quot;Oh get real, Rock, that&#39;s just a fucking character in a book!&quot; Revy 
snapped, slapping Rock from behind the head. &quot;However, it does seem a 
bit odd that she would have the same name as that guy.&quot;

&quot;I find it more than odd,&quot; replied Rock, rubbing the back of his head. 
&quot;This could be dangerous!&quot;

It was there that Dutch decided that enough is enough. &quot;Okay everybody, 
calm down!&quot; he said in a rather loud voice. &quot;We&#39;re letting this bit of 
news get the best of us!&quot; He then stood up and gathered his vest. &quot;Look, 
we&#39;re all a bit jumpy right now, so I suggest we take a little time to 
relax a bit. It might be a while before this trouble comes our way, so 
beforehand let&#39;s go down to the Yellow Flag and enjoy ourselves.&quot;

&quot;Now that I can agree upon,&quot; Benny said, placing the chip he was 
studying in his shirt pocket. &quot;At least I can concentrate on what this 
thing is while we&#39;re at it.&quot; He then headed downstairs to warm up the 
car.

&quot;That&#39;s the spirit, Benny-boy. Revy, Rock, make sure the office is 
locked-up before we leave.&quot; Dutch then followed Benny out of the office.

&quot;Will do, Dutch,&quot; Rock said, straightening up his paperwork before 
leaving.

&quot;And while you&#39;re at it,&quot; Revy said, &quot;why don&#39;t you, for once, get out 
of that shitty shirt and tie and get on some real clothes?&quot;

&quot;Do you mean you want me to wear that ugly shirt again? I told you Revy, 
it&#39;s not my style!&quot; Rock shot back.

&quot;It&#39;s NOT ugly!&quot; Revy snapped.

&quot;People, we&#39;re burning dark here!&quot; Dutch called-out from the corridor. 
Taking one last glare at each other, Rock and Revy decided to table 
their argument until another time.
