<h1>The Wild Horse Thesis (part 18 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/calamity.html">Calamity-Queen of Cordite</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/wildhorse-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>AN:  Thanks for all the fantastic reviews and the warm reception this 
story has gotten. Some have felt like the last chapter wasn&#39;t quite up 
to the quality as the rest of the story. Perhaps this is so. I literally 
had to force the chapter out since action sequences are not particularly 
my most enjoyable thing to write and I think it showed at times. Add to 
this, my knowledge of &#39;End of Evangelion&#39; (the movie) is limited to 
second hand information and action sequences seen on AMV&#39;s. The result 
being, my frame work wasn&#39;t nearly as strong as it was with the rest of 
the story. My apologies if you felt it was sub-par.

As for how I dealt with Kaoru, yes, the fight was a bit one-sided. The 
reasoning for this is that beyond his AT barrier and ability to 
levitate, Koaru&#39;s main offensive capability appeared to be controlling 
an Eva remotely. By confronting him before he could take possession of 
an Eva, Ranma pretty much defanged his offensive capability from the 
beginning. I couldn&#39;t see any other way for that battle to go.

As for concerns that Ranma receiving an S2 organ making him god-like, I 
think that&#39;s completely unfounded. Getting control of the Nekoken was a 
much greater power-up. For the purposes of this story, an S2 organ is 
largely a ki amplifier. The primary effect it has on Ranma is that it 
allows his ki reserves to last longer and recover faster since he&#39;s 
using less ki to do the same things.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

After Misato pulled herself together and the teens were checked out and 
given a clean bill of health by the medics, Misato sent them to a secure 
suite inside NERV. Though they were ready to fight on, now that the 
fight was over, all of them were mentally and emotionally spent. They 
needed food and rest badly.

After the three of them returned from the cafeteria where they had made 
the staff there earn their salary, Ranma, Rei, and Asuka lay in each 
other&#39;s arms on the large bed in their suite.

&quot;R-Ranma?&quot; Asuka asked hesitantly. &quot;W-when do you think you&#39;ll know if 
you have to go back?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure, Koi,&quot; Ranma answered. &quot;As far as I know, the world is 
safe from the Third Impact now. If it happens, I think it will be soon.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Asuka said somberly. &quot;I know we&#39;re all tired, but do you 
wanna...you know...just in case we don&#39;t get another chance?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I would like that as well,&quot; Rei agreed.

Ranma smiled at the girls and began to kiss them. The three of them made 
desperate love to one another for the next two hours before collapsing, 
sweaty and spent in each other&#39;s arms and drifting off to sleep.

Basking in the afterglow of their lovemaking, the girls didn&#39;t notice 
when Ranma began to slowly fade from their world.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Well, now this was unexpected,&quot; a familiar female voice said in 
consternation, startling Ranma awake.

He looked up to see the perplexed face of Bastet regarding him. Then he 
noticed he was laying on the ground. A quick scan of the surroundings 
revealed he was laying in the yard of the Tendo home. Then something 
else penetrated his awareness. It was so common and reassuring for him 
now, he didn&#39;t register it as odd for several moments. Obviously it was 
the source of Bastet&#39;s concern.

Laying beside him, snuggled tightly to each side lay two girls, one with 
pale, blue hair and one with vibrant red. Joy welled up within Ranma as 
he realized that while he had been returned to his home reality, the 
girls he loved had been brought along with him.

Ranma hugged them tightly and in doing so, jostled them awake.

&quot;W-wha?&quot; Asuka asked groggily, noticing she was laying on the ground.

&quot;Where are we?&quot; Rei asked, sounding much more alert.

&quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; Bastet said, vanishing.

&quot;I think somehow you guys got pulled back to my reality with me,&quot; Ranma 
said in awe. &quot;You know what this means?&quot;

&quot;Does it mean we get to stay with each other?&quot; Asuka asked, hardly 
daring to hope.

&quot;That would be a reasonable conclusion,&quot; Rei observed, then began 
smiling broadly.

Ranma nodded enthusiastically and matched her smile. However, a moment 
later, they noticed they were all lying naked in a quite public place. 
Ranma quietly led them to the dojo so they would be out of sight until 
he could get them all some clothing.

Before he could go though, Bastet reappeared. Seeing the teens blushing 
and trying to cover themselves, she grinned and waved her hand. 
Instantly, Rei and Asuka were wearing fine silk Cheongsams. Rei&#39;s was 
pale blue, matching her hair and was embroidered with a beautiful red 
and gold phoenix. Asuka&#39;s was red and sported a gold and blue dragon. 
Ranma was wearing his accustomed silk tang and kung fu pants, only in 
black, and decorated with a red and blue tiger on the back of the tang. 
The teens were soon fawning over each other about how beautiful the 
girls looked and how gorgeous Ranma was.

&quot;Ahem,&quot; Bastet cleared her throat to get their attention. The goddess 
couldn&#39;t help but smile at the three.

&quot;Who&#39;s she, Liebling?&quot; Asuka asked.

&quot;Girls, meet Bastet, Goddess of motherhood, pleasure, and cats,&quot; Ranma 
introduced. &quot;Apparently, she&#39;s my patron goddess and she&#39;s the one that 
sent me to your world.&quot;

The girls both bowed deeply to Bastet.

&quot;Thank you, Bastet-sama for sending Ranma to us,&quot; Rei said.

&quot;Yes, and thank you for not making him leave us,&quot; Asuka said.

&quot;Um...yes, about that,&quot; Bastet laughed nervously then waved her hands at 
the alarmed expressions on the teens faces. &quot;Relax, you get to stay 
together. It wasn&#39;t what was supposed to happen, but it seems you&#39;ve 
found a way around it.&quot;

&quot;Explain,&quot; Rei said.

&quot;Evidently, when you and Ranma healed Asuka, you both soul-bonded with 
Ranma and you and Asuka both acquired a piece of his soul,&quot; Bastet 
explained. &quot;That was enough to cause you both to be pulled back with 
him. When that happened, The Ultimate Force, which is more powerful than 
any god or goddess and is responsible for preventing paradoxes that 
could damage the fabric of reality, moved to correct the fact that the 
two of you shouldn&#39;t exist here by establishing your existence.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Ranma asked adroitly.

&quot;They now have an identity and history here,&quot; Bastet grinned, handing 
each girl an envelope. &quot;It&#39;s a pretty sweet deal too. Asuka has all her 
degrees and Rei has some of her own. You all have the funds you were 
paid by NERV in bank accounts in your names. That comes out to a 
substantial piece of wealth in this economy so the three of you are 
quite well off. Asuka and Rei are emancipated minors as well.&quot;

&quot;Awesome!&quot; Asuka cheered.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Bastet smiled. &quot;Well, there is a downside. The pair of you are 
about to be dropped into the chaos of Ranma&#39;s life here. It won&#39;t be 
easy. As for you, Blessed One, I am proud of you. You have learned what 
I wished for you to learn and I expect you to keep on learning, and not 
just martial arts. Now, it&#39;s nearly time to face the music, so I have to 
be going. They all watched your adventures so they know what happened to 
you. One last thing, take your time, but in the next few years, I do 
expect kittens...&quot;

Bastet faded away, laughing at the blushing teens. No sooner than the 
goddess was gone, the shoji door to the dojo slid open.

&quot;Ran...ma,&quot; Akane stammered. &quot;Ranma! You&#39;re back! Hey! Everyone! Ranma&#39;s 
back!&quot; Akane yelled toward the house.

Ranma didn&#39;t quite know what to expect. He had been away for over a year 
from his perspective so much of the conditioning that had been 
repeatedly pounded into him had faded. However, having his arms full of 
excited, uncute tomboy was definitely not on his list of possibilities.

&quot;Oh Ranma, you really did it!&quot; Akane gushed. &quot;We saw the whole thing on 
video. You managed to change the whole ending and save everyone! Well, 
almost everyone. That was so sad about Dr. Akagi, but she really turned 
herself around from how she was. She was very selfless and I was proud 
of her!&quot;

Chaos erupted as the rest of the Tendo household burst into the dojo 
with Genma in the lead.

&quot;Boy! How could you be so weak as to allow yourself to be banished from 
your family duty!&quot; the Fat Panda bellowed. &quot;You must restore your honor 
by marrying Akane immediately!&quot;

&quot;Waaahhh, Ranma&#39;s back and the schools will finally be joined!&quot; the 
Human Flood added.

&quot;Welcome home, Ranma-kun,&quot; Kasumi greeted pleasantly.

&quot;Yes, welcome home, my manly son,&quot; Nodoka chimed in.

&quot;Really, Saotome, you&#39;ve collected more girls?&quot; Nabiki said, causing 
everyone to freeze as they noticed the two additional girls sitting near 
Ranma.

&quot;Um...well...yeah, I couldn&#39;t just leave them behind,&quot; Ranma laughed 
nervously. &quot;Everyone, I&#39;d like you to meet Rei Ayanami, and Asuka 
Langley Sohryu.&quot;

&quot;Ranma! How dare you cheat on my little girl!&quot; Soun&#39;s demon-head 
screamed.

After facing the horrors that Ranma had, Soun&#39;s technique impressed the 
pigtailed warrior not a bit. However, when Genma jumped in and began 
lamenting about his dishonorable son, Ranma became annoyed.

&quot;SILENCE!&quot; Ranma commanded, projecting an aura of, well...Absolute 
Terror.

The two older men pissed themselves and cowered as Ranma seemed to loom 
over them in spite of the fact that he was shorter than both.

&quot;Hold it a second, Saotome, it says here that Rei is our cousin?&quot; Nabiki 
asked, looking through the papers they had been given. &quot;How could she 
possibly be our cousin? She&#39;s a fictional character from an anime.&quot;

&quot;Not anymore,&quot; Ranma smirked. &quot;Call it Divine Intervention.&quot;

&quot;Oh my, does this mean you will be taking up the engagement on behalf of 
the Tendo family, Rei-san?&quot; Kasumi asked serenely.

&quot;If Ranma wishes it, I will gladly agree to such an arrangement,&quot; Rei 
responded.

&quot;What about you?&quot; Nabiki directed at Asuka. &quot;Are you going to be chasing 
him too?&quot;

&quot;Ranma is my best friend,&quot; Asuka shrugged. &quot;I love him dearly. Rei and I 
both decided that we would never make him choose between us. Besides, I 
love her as much as Ranma, so I don&#39;t see a problem with the three of us 
being together.&quot;

&quot;I too am not adverse to sharing Ranma with Asuka-chan,&quot; Rei added. &quot;We 
are bonded to each other on a profound level.&quot;

&quot;My son is so manly!&quot; Nodoka cried, whipping out her victory fans and 
dancing around the room.

&quot;Right,&quot; Asuka agreed. &quot;Besides, Ranma is twice the man anyone else is 
so it all works out.&quot;

The redhead grinned triumphantly and high-fived Rei behind Ranma&#39;s head.

&quot;Some would say Ranma was only half a man,&quot; Nabiki smirked.

&quot;Ranma&#39;s condition does not bother me,&quot; Rei said. &quot;Nor does it affect 
his manhood. Also, is it not desirable to be in a relationship with a 
set of twins?&quot;

Rei&#39;s lips quirked up slightly. With her dry delivery, it was the only 
indication that she had just cracked a joke. As such, only Asuka and 
Ranma caught the humorous intent, leaving the others to gape as the two 
of them began laughing hysterically. Rei&#39;s smile became noticeable as 
she watched her friends appreciate her sense of humor.

When Kasumi joined them in their mirth, Akane and Nabiki found their 
faces firmly planted on the floor.

&quot;Oh my, Rei-san. You&#39;re so funny,&quot; Kasumi giggled innocently.

&quot;Ranma will marry Akane!&quot; Genma bellowed, his stupidity overriding his 
sense of self-preservation, there by proving that Genma&#39;s stupidity was 
boundless.

&quot;Quite right, Saotome,&quot; Soun added, also proving that the stupidity was 
infectious.

&quot;Nonsense, Father,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;It&#39;s Ranma&#39;s choice and he is 
obviously quite taken with Rei-san and Asuka-san. Akane, you don&#39;t have 
any objection to Rei-san taking your place, do you?&quot;

&quot;I-I...I guess not,&quot; Akane stammered. &quot;If the perverted jerk wants them, 
then that&#39;s his choice.&quot; Akane added a small smile to show that, while 
disappointed, she was willing to let it go.

&quot;Thank you, Akane-san,&quot; Rei said, bowing to her.

Akane returned the bow. Contrary to popular belief, Akane was a romantic 
at heart and she had seen the three of them come together on the video. 
In spite of her feelings of jealousy, watching Ranma try so hard to 
befriend them, she thought it was beautiful how they came to care for 
each other. If Ranma had tried that hard with her, she was sure that 
they would have been deeply in love by now. It irked her that she 
watched Ranma become the man she always wanted on that video, but she 
found she couldn&#39;t blame him. Instead, she decided that she would just 
be his friend and be happy for him.

&quot;B-but what about me, Ran-chan?&quot; Ukyo stammered.

Ranma looked at her compassionately.

&quot;Sorry, Ucchan,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;You were always my best friend, but I love 
you like a sister, not like I love Rei and Asuka.&quot;

&quot;B-but what about my dowry? What about the ten years I wasted looking 
for you?&quot; Ukyo asked bitterly.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ukyo,&quot; Ranma said somberly. &quot;I can try to pay you back for 
the dowry, but the rest you have to take up with the one that ripped you 
off.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right, Dear,&quot; Nodoka said. &quot;I already said that I&#39;ve dissolved 
all Ranma&#39;s engagements. You shall just have to speak with my husband 
about compensating you for his duplicity, although, some of the blame 
rests with your father as well. He knew fully well that Ranma was 
already obligated to another arrangement when he offered your yattai as 
a dowry. He expected for my family to dishonor another agreement in 
favor of his. He knew an agreement based on dishonor had no honor 
itself.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Ukyo said, searching for some way to salvage this. &quot;My 
father...he will never let me return without revenge or Ranma&#39;s hand in 
marriage.&quot;

&quot;If he should disown you, Dear,&quot; Nodoka grinned, her eyes gleaming at 
the prospect of another source of grandbabies, &quot;I would be happy to 
adopt you into our clan as the sister that Ranma feels you to be.&quot;

Ukyo shuddered at the unholy light in Nodoka&#39;s eyes and quickly decided 
to quit while she was ahead.

Shampoo decided it was her turn. She wasn&#39;t quite sure how to deal with 
this situation. On the one hand, the odd, blue-haired girl and Airen&#39;s 
twin were obstacles. Everyone knows &#39;obstacles are for killing&#39;. On the 
other hand, something told her that any attacks on them would make her 
Airen very angry. Airen was also a blooded warrior now, something of a 
respected status in the Amazon tribe and someone that was not to be 
trifled with. Still, she had to know something.

&quot;Is true what Airen said? Airen really want to forget about Shampoo?&quot; 
the purple-haired Amazon asked hesitantly.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Ranma asked, not recalling the incident Shampoo was referring to.

&quot;Is true Airen no love Shampoo?&quot; she asked again.

Ranma looked extremely uncomfortable. His mouth opened and closed a few 
times before he looked down.

&quot;You hunted his female form across China,&quot; Rei spoke up. &quot;You threatened 
his friends and family, and then used deceitful tactics in order to 
force him into a relationship.&quot;

&quot;If you ask me, you&#39;re asking the wrong question,&quot; Asuka chimed in, her 
tone harsh. &quot;You should all be asking his forgiveness for what you put 
him through.&quot;

Shampoo bristled at this.

&quot;Is Shampoo&#39;s husband!&quot; she insisted. &quot;Is law! No need ask husband for 
forgiveness!&quot;

Cologne sighed tiredly as she saw Ranma&#39;s eyes come up and harden.

&quot;Which is exactly why I would never marry you, Shampoo,&quot; Ranma growled. 
&quot;You see me the same as Pop sees you; inferior because of my gender and 
not worth your respect as a person. No Shampoo, I don&#39;t love you. 
There&#39;s been times I really debated whether or not I could even be 
friends with you given the casual way you view use of lethal force. You 
haven&#39;t crossed that line so far, so I&#39;m still willing to be friends 
with you, but I&#39;ll never be your husband.&quot;

&quot;You already is,&quot; Shampoo insisted. &quot;Is law!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t recognize your laws,&quot; Ranma snapped. &quot;In case you haven&#39;t 
noticed, we&#39;re not in your little village anymore. You have no power to 
enforce your laws on me. If you did, I would have been hauled back to 
China a long time ago.&quot;

&quot;He is quite correct, Shampoo, though I am loath to admit it,&quot; Cologne 
said sadly. &quot;I had hoped you would have realized that before now.&quot;

&quot;But Great Grandmother...&quot; Shampoo argued.

&quot;No buts, Shampoo,&quot; Cologne said. &quot;A warrior knows when the battle is 
lost. I won&#39;t let your stubbornness alienate as powerful a potential 
ally as the three of them are. I am dissolving the Kiss of Marriage. You 
have already paid for your failure to fulfill the Kiss of Death, so 
Ranma is no longer subject to that either. Don&#39;t let your foolish pride 
lead you into another situation you cannot hope to win.&quot;

&quot;But Great Grandmother cannot dissolve Kiss of Marriage!&quot; Shampoo 
argued. &quot;Is not allowed!&quot;

&quot;It is if the circumstances in which it had been given were 
questionable,&quot; Cologne stated. &quot;And these certainly were. Ranma never 
defeated you in a formal challenge aside from the one that led to the 
Kiss of Death, in fact, he never defeated you at all. You were knocked 
out by your own weapon, which you shamefully failed to avoid when it was 
broken. Therefore, you had no grounds to give him the Kiss of Marriage 
to begin with.&quot;

Shampoo looked at the ground in shame.

&quot;Excuse me, but if that&#39;s true than why did you allow this girl to 
pursue my son for so long?&quot; Nodoka asked.

&quot;The answer is simple,&quot; Cologne chuckled. &quot;Ranma is quite frankly the 
most talented martial artist I&#39;ve ever seen. As long as he hadn&#39;t made a 
decision, there was still a chance to get him into the tribe and take 
him as the heir to my knowledge of the art. Also, watching the chaos 
that takes place around him was the most amusing time I&#39;ve had in 
years.&quot;

&quot;But how could I be your heir when...?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;You&#39;re male?&quot; Cologne chuckled. &quot;Surely you&#39;ve realized that males are 
permitted to be warriors in the tribe. How else would you explain 
Mousse? That, and given your curse, you could have achieved honorary 
female status among the warriors. As to why I wanted you for the heir to 
my art, I&#39;m sad to say that Shampoo will never be your equal in the art, 
so while she would have been my political heir, you would have been the 
heir to my most powerful Amazon techniques.&quot;

&quot;Elder, I don&#39;t know what to say,&quot; Ranma said, stunned. &quot;You honor me. 
I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t take you up on that.&quot;

&quot;Easy come, easy go, Ranma,&quot; Cologne smiled. &quot;It will be enough for me 
if you would consider the Amazon people in a friendly manner in the 
future.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that, Elder,&quot; Ranma said respectfully. &quot;You have helped me out 
when I needed it.&quot;

Meanwhile, Shampoo was fuming. She had had her heart broken, been told 
she would never be the equal of a mere male, and would now have to face 
going back to the village in disgrace yet again. She would have 
vengeance.

(oO\O/Oo)

The next day found Ranma, Rei, and Asuka moved into the Saotome house in 
Chofu. Genma had been forbidden to return until he made restitution to 
all those he had duped during the training trip. They were currently on 
their way to meet the Tendo sisters at the ice cream parlor to celebrate 
Ranma&#39;s return.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe that went as well as it did,&quot; Ranma mentioned again. &quot;I 
mean, no fights broke out or anything.&quot;

&quot;I am pleased,&quot; Rei said. &quot;I am very pleased that Asuka-chan and I got 
to stay with you, Koishii.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m pretty thrilled about that myself,&quot; Ranma said, giving the girls a 
squeeze with her arms around their waists and ignoring the odd looks the 
three of them were getting from the populous.

&quot;So what are we gonna do now, Liebling?&quot; Asuka asked.

&quot;Well, I suppose I have to finish school,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Are you sure you 
guys really want to go with me?&quot;

&quot;Well, it can&#39;t be that hard,&quot; Asuka smirked. &quot;And I still need to work 
on my Kanji if I&#39;m gonna live here in Japan.&quot;

&quot;Yes, attending school with you will help us become familiar with this 
world,&quot; Rei stated.

&quot;Yeah, well, at least Jin Dai is a normal High School,&quot; Ranma said 
wryly. &quot;I can&#39;t say I&#39;m upset about leaving Furinkan and its craziness 
behind.&quot;

&quot;But I meant after we graduate?&quot; Asuka said. &quot;What are your plans, 
Liebling?&quot;

&quot;I-I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ranma said hesitantly. &quot;I mean I&#39;m kinda sick of the 
whole war and international intrigue thing, ya know? And somehow just 
running a dojo seems a little tame after all that. How about you two?&quot;

&quot;I dunno, Liebling,&quot; Asuka said seriously. &quot;I mean I do have my degree 
in science, but like you said, I have a hard time seeing myself as just 
a scientist. I hadn&#39;t really given much thought to what I wanted to do 
beyond piloting an Eva. Maybe police work? I kinda like the idea of 
taking down bad guys.&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound like a bad idea at all,&quot; Ranma agreed. &quot;I might have 
to think about that for myself as well. What about you, Rei-chan?&quot;

&quot;I-I do not know,&quot; Rei said, blushing. &quot;I never considered living past 
the purpose I was created for.&quot; Rei smiled a small smile. &quot;Perhaps I can 
stay home and take care of the &#39;kittens&#39;?&quot;

Ranma and Asuka burst into gales of laughter.

&quot;You&#39;d be a great Mom, Rei-chan,&quot; Ranma said affectionately.

&quot;Do you really think so?&quot; Rei asked, blushing self-consciously.

&quot;Yup,&quot; Ranma nodded. &quot;I think both of you would.&quot;

Ranma grinned happily, noticing that both girls were now blushing.

&quot;Yo, Saotome!&quot; Ranma turned and saw Nabiki waving to her as she, Akane, 
and Kasumi hurried to catch up.

&quot;Hey, &#39;Biki, Kasumi, Akane,&quot; Ranma smiled.

&quot;Hello, girls,&quot; Kasumi smiled pleasantly. &quot;I&#39;m so happy you made it. How 
was the train ride?&quot;

&quot;It was okay,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;Yeah, at least we got to ride on the female-only car to avoid the 
perverts,&quot; Asuka quipped. There was a rash of broken male fingers on the 
train the previous day when Ranma, the girls, and Nodoka had traveled 
home.

&quot;I hate boys,&quot; Akane growled, then grinned to show she was 
joking...mostly. &quot;I just wish I could get away from Furinkan High too. 
I&#39;m worried that things are going to go back to how they were before 
Ranma got here with the morning fights with the hentai-horde.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be happy to be away from the Kuno&#39;s and their insanity as well,&quot; 
Ranma said. &quot;If it does start again, maybe you can move to Chofu and go 
to Jin-Dai with us too.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d really let me move in with you guys after the way I treated you, 
Ranma?&quot; Akane asked in surprise.

&quot;We were in a bad situation, Akane,&quot; Ranma smiled reassuringly. &quot;It 
brought out the worst in us, but I always considered you a friend. I 
might have even loved you as more than a sister. If I can do anything to 
help you or your sisters out, you only have to ask.&quot;

&quot;Does that mean you&#39;re buying my ice cream today, Saotome?&quot; Nabiki 
smirked. &quot;I&#39;m a little short on cash lately.&quot;

Ranma snorted.

&quot;Nabiki? Short on cash? That&#39;ll be the day,&quot; Ranma laughed.

&quot;Well, you can&#39;t blame a girl for trying,&quot; Nabiki giggled.

The five other girls laughed as they continued on to the ice cream shop. 
They almost made it there when a familiar figure stood in their path 
bringing them up short.

&quot;Ukyo?&quot; Ranma greeted tentatively.

The girl looked up, meeting Ranma&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Hiya, Ran-chan,&quot; the chef said softly. &quot;I was wondering, do you think I 
might join you guys?&quot;

&quot;Depends on who&#39;s joining us,&quot; Asuka answered. &quot;We&#39;d be happy to have 
Ranma&#39;s best childhood friend join us. On the other hand, we&#39;d be less 
happy about a girl that wants to use that friendship to try and guilt 
Ranma into being her fianc&eacute;e.&quot;

&quot;I promise, I just want my friend back,&quot; Ukyo said, her eyes shimmering 
with tears. &quot;I wanted to say, I&#39;m sorry for the pain I&#39;ve caused you, 
Ran-chan. I didn&#39;t understand what we were doing to you because I was so 
caught up in the competition.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Ucchan,&quot; Ranma said softly. &quot;I forgive you. I didn&#39;t help 
things either. I just didn&#39;t know how to handle the situation and I was 
too afraid to hurt any of you.&quot;

Ranma opened her arms to Ukyo and Ukyo timidly stepped up to her. Then 
the two old friends were hugging one another.

&quot;Thank you, Ran-chan,&quot; Ukyo said tearfully. &quot;I&#39;m glad you still want to 
be my friend.&quot;

&quot;Always was, always will be, Ucchan,&quot; Ranma said comfortingly.

It was a very bad day for the ice cream industry in Nerima that day. 
Seven attractive girls descended on the place and reduced the counter 
boys to a mass of quivering hormones resulting in loads of free extras. 
Between the Revised Anything Goes Uber-Cute Twin attack, Nabiki&#39;s powers 
of persuasion, and Kasumi&#39;s smile, it was a miracle that the deed to the 
shop wasn&#39;t given away for free. Not that Nabiki didn&#39;t try; she wasn&#39;t 
one to miss an opportunity.

Ranma sat back and looked around her as the seven girls chatted and 
giggled together. She was filled with a profound sense of joy and pride. 
Things were finally turning around for her and she was very thankful to 
Bastet-sama for making it possible.

Suddenly, Rei and Asuka leaned over and kissed her on the cheeks, 
smearing her face with their ice cream covered lips. The other customers 
in the shop looked at them strangely as the seven girls all howled with 
laughter.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Wow,&quot; Ranma said again. &quot;You guys look drop-dead gorgeous in those 
uniforms.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Liebling,&quot; Asuka smiled happily. &quot;I&#39;m not sure though. These 
skirts are awfully short.&quot;

The trio was headed to their first day of school at Jin Dai High and the 
girls were wearing their new school uniforms which consisted of a short, 
pleated, teal-blue mini-skirt and a double-breasted, off-white blazer. 
The skirt wasn&#39;t quite as short as one a cheerleader&#39;s uniform might 
have, but it wasn&#39;t far off and the long, shapely legs of both girls 
were displayed to perfection.

&quot;You won&#39;t hear me complaining,&quot; Ranma grinned and squeezed their hands 
affectionately.

&quot;Oh I don&#39;t know about that, Variable-chan,&quot; Asuka smirked. &quot;I bet we&#39;ll 
hear a lot of complaining when we get you into one.&quot;

Ranma paled as he realized it would be inevitable. He could refuse the 
pair of them nothing and the way Asuka said that left it clear that he 
would be wearing the revealing uniform at some point.

&quot;SHI SHI HOKODAN!&quot; the shout snapped Ranma out of his nervous 
contemplation.

Before he had time to react, all three of them were slammed by the ki 
blast and sent tumbling into a wall surrounding a home.

&quot;Are you guys okay?&quot; Ranma asked Rei and Asuka with urgent concern.

&quot;I am well,&quot; Rei answered.

&quot;What the hell was that?&quot; Asuka demanded.

&quot;Rrrrryoga,&quot; Ranma snarled, fully in &#39;protect mate&#39; mode, ki claws 
forming and his pupils narrowing to slits. He quickly spun and projected 
his AT/ki barrier, causing the charging Lost Boy to crash into it and 
bounce back onto his rear. &quot;Rrrryoga! What the hell do you think 
you&#39;rrrre doing?&quot; Ranma hissed at the boy. &quot;You could have hurt the 
girls, you jackass!&quot;

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t have tried to hide behind them, you cowardly dog!&quot; Ryoga 
shouted, leaping to his feet. &quot;Because of you, Akane hates me! Prepare 
to die, Ranma!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not playing with you anymore, Ryoga,&quot; Ranma growled. &quot;You insist on 
endangering innocent bystanders, you constantly blame me for problems 
you caused yourself, and you attack without warning, like the 
dishonorable trash you arrrre. This will stop even if I have to cripple 
you to stop it. Do you understand?&quot;

&quot;Shut up and die, Ranma!&quot; Ryoga yelled and attacked with his umbrella.

Ranma dodged the strike and negligently flicked his hand toward the 
umbrella. His ki claws neatly sectioned the weapon leaving only a short 
section of handle in Ryoga&#39;s hand. Ryoga threw the remains of the weapon 
at Ranma and began to attack him with kicks and punches. Ranma flowed 
around the blows while delivering his own punishment. The only thing 
keeping Ryoga in the fight was his extreme durability. While he couldn&#39;t 
hit Ranma, he was able to shrug off Ranma&#39;s strikes as if they were 
nothing.

Frustrated with his inability to hit his hated nemesis, Ryoga stabbed a 
finger at the ground, unleashing the Bakusai Tenketsu. Ranma quickly 
threw up his AT barrier to deflect the shrapnel.

&quot;Ranma! Look out!&quot; Asuka yelled.

From behind Ranma, Mousse appeared and launched a swarm of shuriken at 
the pigtailed warrior&#39;s unprotected back. Ranma moved with cat-like 
agility, dropping to the ground and releasing the AT barrier. The 
shuriken flashed through the space Ranma had been in and not finding 
their target continued on. Ryoga was caught off guard and suddenly found 
himself in the path of the weapons. He threw up his arms to protect his 
vital areas and several of the spikes embedded themselves in his 
forearms and legs.

&quot;Ranma, for disgracing Shampoo, I will kill you!&quot; Mousse screamed, 
ignoring the fact he had just hit his ally with his attack.

&quot;Fool! You couldn&#39;t beat me before and you can&#39;t beat me now!&quot; Ranma 
snarled. &quot;This shit is getting real old, you know that?&quot;

Ranma maneuvered himself where he could see both his opponents. Ryoga 
wasn&#39;t looking too good as he began plucking the shuriken out. As the 
Lost Boy removed the last shuriken, he collapsed. Mousse began to grin 
wickedly and Ranma assumed that the shuriken had been coated with some 
sort of drug to knock him out.

&quot;I might not be able to beat you, Ranma, but I don&#39;t have to,&quot; Mousse 
declared.

Suddenly, the wall behind Asuka and Rei blew outward, knocking them down 
with the shower of debris.

&quot;ASUKA! REI!&quot; Ranma shouted. He could tell they weren&#39;t seriously hurt, 
but he was furious that they had been attacked yet again.

&quot;Shampoo kill husband-stealer sluts!&quot; Shampoo said, leaping through the 
hole she&#39;d made; bonbori at the ready.

Asuka rolled out of the way as the vengeful Amazon viciously swung the 
bonbori at her head. The sidewalk cracked as the blow narrowly missed 
the German girl. Rei used her AT barrier to deflect a blow sent her way 
as she struggled to her feet.

&quot;Weird tricks not help you against Shampoo,&quot; Shampoo snapped.

&quot;Shampoo, stop this right now,&quot; Ranma commanded. &quot;If you hurt either of 
them, I&#39;ll make you suffer for a LONG time!&quot;

&quot;Shampoo already disgraced. Suffering no matter to Shampoo,&quot; Shampoo 
said angrily.

&quot;You may be disgraced but at least you can still fight,&quot; Ranma growled 
icily. &quot;How would you like to experience the Ultimate Weakness 
Moxibustion?&quot;

&quot;Shampoo no worried,&quot; Shampoo said confidently. &quot;Great Grandmother know 
counter.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but are you sure she&#39;d use it if I told her why I applied it?&quot; 
Ranma questioned.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Shampoo said. &quot;It no matter if Shampoo kill weak outsider 
womans.&quot;

&quot;Then you really are the brainless twit you sound like,&quot; Ranma answered.

&quot;I won&#39;t let you talk that way to Shampoo!&quot; Mousse cried and attacked.

&quot;MOUKO TAKABISHA!&quot; Ranma shouted and fired a ball of red-gold energy at 
Mousse.

The myopic Amazon was caught in mid-leap and sent crashing through a 
stone wall before being stopped by another. He collapsed, unconscious, 
and wouldn&#39;t be rejoining the fight anytime soon.

It was then that the police arrived from the neighborhood Koban 
responding to reports of a disturbance.

&quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot; the ranking officer demanded.

&quot;We were on our way to school when these people attacked us, Officer,&quot; 
Asuka explained, not taking her eyes off Shampoo.

&quot;You no interfere,&quot; Shampoo snarled at the police. &quot;This woman to woman 
fight.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s not going to be anymore fighting,&quot; the officer in charge 
declared. &quot;This isn&#39;t an arena. It&#39;s a city street. You are all coming 
with us for disturbing the peace and destruction of private property.&quot;

The officer took a step toward Shampoo, who whirled on him with her 
weapons at ready.

&quot;Shampoo say you no interfere. Now Shampoo teach foolish males their 
place,&quot; the Amazon said menacingly.

&quot;If that&#39;s the way you want it,&quot; the officers took out their tonfa.

&quot;WAIT!&quot; Ranma shouted at the officers. &quot;Don&#39;t get near her, she&#39;s way 
too skilled for you. Please let me handle this. I can put her down.&quot;

Naturally, the officers, not having seen the things their counterparts 
in Nerima had, didn&#39;t listened to the pigtailed boy&#39;s entreaty. They 
approached the purple-haired Amazon with the intent to subdue her. They 
soon found out they were woefully outclassed as the first one came 
within range and got sent flying by a bonbori to the gut.

They instantly backed off and one went to check on their comrade while 
the rest pulled their service revolvers.

&quot;Drop the weapons NOW!&quot; the ranking officer commanded. &quot;Don&#39;t make us 
have to shoot you!&quot;

&quot;Officer, please, let me take her down?&quot; Ranma pleaded. &quot;I can make sure 
nobody else gets hurt!&quot;

&quot;Stay out of this, Son,&quot; the policeman said.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t do that, Officer,&quot; Ranma sighed. &quot;As much of a pain 
in the ass as she is, I won&#39;t let her get shot when I can stop her. Rei, 
Asuka, protect the officers.&quot;

With that, Ranma blurred from sight. Shampoo found herself flying 
through the air holding the severed handles of her bonbori. Her flight 
was abruptly stopped as she found herself slammed into the ground on her 
stomach and then she felt a searing pain on her back. She began 
screaming in her native tongue as she realized what had been done to 
her. She attempted to push herself up, but was unable to due to Ranma&#39;s 
foot resting lightly on her back.

&quot;It&#39;s over, Officers,&quot; Ranma called out. &quot;You can come take her into 
custody now. She&#39;s not a threat to you anymore.&quot;

The policemen cautiously approached the downed Amazon and quickly cuffed 
her. She struggled but her attempts to break free were pitiful now that 
her strength was sealed.

Ranma went over and performed the Moxibustion on Mousse as well before 
dragging him back out to the street. He then moved to Ryoga, intent on 
the same treatment. It was then that he realized how badly this had all 
gone. Whatever was on those shuriken was deadly. The Lost Boy had fought 
his last fight.

&quot;GODAMMIT!&quot; Ranma roared in anger. &quot;They killed him!&quot; Ranma spat when 
everyone looked at him in question. &quot;He was a pig-headed moron but he 
didn&#39;t deserve to die!&quot;

The police quickly came over to check on the fallen boy to confirm 
Ranma&#39;s statement. Ranma warned them not to touch the shuriken because 
of the poison he was certain they&#39;d find on them.

&quot;Who killed him?&quot; the lead officer asked.

&quot;The one in the robes, Mousse, threw them at me,&quot; Ranma said sadly. 
&quot;This one, his name was Ryoga Hibiki, was trying to distract me so I 
wouldn&#39;t be able to avoid them. I ducked. He didn&#39;t and got hit with 
several of them. I didn&#39;t think any of them were serious wounds. When he 
collapsed, I figured the shuriken had some sort of drug on them to put 
him to sleep.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

The Chofu division of the Japanese National Police got a crash course on 
things their Nerima counterparts dealt with on a daily basis. The curses 
were demonstrated, as was Ranma&#39;s ability to produce a ball of ki. They 
were, quite frankly, stupefied that such things existed and had no clue 
how to deal with it.

In the end, they called up the Nerima division for advice. What they 
were told didn&#39;t sit well with them. The Nerima division followed a 
hands-off policy. They allowed the martial arts community to police 
themselves given the fact that they were ill-equipped to deal with 
people with as much power as the martial artist that resided there.

The fact that there had been a death changed things a bit. The police 
had to be involved under the circumstances. Fortunately, Ranma had 
rendered the suspect impotent to escape custody.

Cologne arrived a couple hours after the attack looking grim.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ranma,&quot; Cologne said somberly. &quot;I had no idea they were 
planning something like this.&quot;

&quot;The question is, what do you plan to do about it?&quot; Ranma asked, his 
anger and frustration clear. &quot;Ryoga was killed over this foolishness. It 
has to stop.&quot;

&quot;And so it shall,&quot; Cologne agreed. &quot;I understand that you used the 
Ultimate Weakness Moxibustion on them both?&quot;

&quot;I did,&quot; Ranma admitted.

&quot;I expect that they will both be deported,&quot; Cologne said. &quot;If that 
happens then I&#39;ll be using the Cat&#39;s Tongue on Mousse. I&#39;ll be leaving 
Shampoo&#39;s strength locked for now as a punishment for disobeying me. She 
will have to face the council to receive punishment for defying an 
Elder&#39;s orders. She&#39;ll be lucky if she doesn&#39;t get her curse locked as 
well.&quot;

&quot;Frankly, Cologne, I don&#39;t care what happens to them as long as they 
don&#39;t come back here again,&quot; Ranma sighed. &quot;They crossed the line. The 
next time they come after me or my girls, I&#39;ll make sure it doesn&#39;t 
happen again.&quot;

&quot;Understood, Ranma,&quot; Cologne said grimly.

&quot;Please understand, Elder, I can&#39;t tolerate this stuff anymore,&quot; Ranma 
said. &quot;I want to have a family someday and I can&#39;t risk my children 
being hurt when some obsessed idiot feels the need to attack me for some 
asinine reason.&quot;

&quot;You are a blooded warrior now, Ranma,&quot; Cologne said seriously. &quot;I 
wouldn&#39;t expect any less. You&#39;ve grown a lot since you got sent to that 
other world. I respect that.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Cologne,&quot; Ranma replied. &quot;I just hope this is the last of the 
fools from Nerima, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard the last of the Kuno&#39;s. 
I&#39;m afraid I might have to follow through on my threat to be through 
with them.&quot;

&quot;Actually, the Kuno boy shouldn&#39;t be a concern,&quot; Cologne grinned.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;It seems when young Akane...er...rejected his advances while you were 
gone, the loss of his...virility...had much the same effect as when a 
dog is neutered,&quot; Cologne cackled. &quot;It calmed him right down. I 
understand he&#39;s keeping a very low profile now.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t say I feel sorry for him, but I am sorry it had to come to 
that,&quot; Ranma commented. &quot;Kodachi could still be a nuisance though.&quot;

&quot;True. However, while the Kuno&#39;s may get a pass in Nerima, I doubt they 
will receive the same benefits here in Chofu,&quot; Cologne pointed out. 
&quot;Were she to make herself a threat to you here, you could always handle 
her the same way you dealt with Shampoo and Mousse. The authorities 
could then deal with her.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully it won&#39;t come to that,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;That still leaves 
Happosai and Taro though.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about Happi,&quot; Cologne chuckled. &quot;He knows 
when he&#39;s out matched. Ever since you came back your aura has been as 
bright as the sun to anyone that can sense it. The same with those girls 
of yours. He won&#39;t bother you much. It&#39;d be more trouble than it&#39;s worth 
to him. As for Taro, I&#39;m afraid he is someone you may have to deal 
with.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

After spending the day at the police station being questioned, Ranma and 
the girls were released. Ranma was even unofficially thanked for his 
assistance in subduing Shampoo.

&quot;While I know this was not your fault, Son,&quot; Nodoka said as they walked 
home, &quot;I don&#39;t wish for you spending the day at the police station to 
become a habit. It&#39;s unseemly.&quot;

&quot;Believe me, Mom, I don&#39;t want it to be a habit either,&quot; Ranma said. 
&quot;I&#39;m just worried that more of Pop&#39;s stupidity will come lookin&#39; for 
me.&quot;

&quot;He had better hope for his sake it doesn&#39;t,&quot; Nodoka said darkly.

(oO\O/Oo)

The following weeks went by without incident. The trio actually managed 
to make it to school. Ranma, Rei, and Asuka all joined the Martial Arts 
Club. Asuka also went out for the softball team and made it.

The three had caused quite a stir when it became clear that both girls 
were dating Ranma. Several of the guys took exception to this, but a few 
casual displays of power deterred all but the more determined. Ranma was 
quite amazed that no obsessive loons came out of the woodwork to attempt 
to claim Rei or Asuka.

The only trouble Ranma had was with the school gangs. They had sought to 
assert their dominance, but had quickly found they had bitten off more 
than they could chew. Ranma quickly tracked down the leaders of the 
gangs and promised if their gang gave him any trouble, or if he caught 
them bullying other non-gang members, he would personally come by and 
make it painful for the gang leader.

&quot;If you and the other gangs want to cause each other trouble, I couldn&#39;t 
care less,&quot; Ranma told them. &quot;But you won&#39;t do it on school property and 
you won&#39;t harass innocents or I&#39;ll harass you...painfully.&quot;

It took a few demonstrations of Ranma&#39;s resolve, but eventually the gang 
activity was greatly curtailed. The Chofu police were impressed with the 
drop in the juvenile crime rates.

(oO\O/Oo)

It was a month and a half after Ranma returned with the girls that it 
happened. Rei came out of the bathroom one morning looking vaguely 
distressed.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Rei?&quot; Ranma asked, concerned.

&quot;I-I appear to be bleeding,&quot; Rei said shakily. &quot;From down there.&quot; She 
gestured toward her abdomen.

Ranma looked at Asuka, who looked back at Ranma.

&quot;Asuka-chan, I think it&#39;s your turn to handle this one,&quot; Ranma prodded.

&quot;Oh, no, Variable-chan. You did such a good job with me, I think you 
should explain it to Rei-chan,&quot; Asuka smirked.

&quot;But I&#39;m a guy,&quot; Ranma said in an overly-reasonable tone. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t 
have to explain it. Rei-chan would be much more comfortable if YOU 
explained it to her.&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;re more experienced than I am with it,&quot; Asuka pointed out, &quot;so 
you should be the one to explain it.&quot;

&quot;I would suggest that SOMEBODY explain it, before I become unpleasant,&quot; 
Rei said ominously.

&quot;Explain what, Dear?&quot; Nodoka asked, coming in the room.

Ranma and Asuka looked at each other and grinned.

&quot;Mom, Rei-chan&#39;s having...you know...&quot; Ranma said blushing.

&quot;Female issues,&quot; Asuka added, &quot;Her first time.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Nodoka smiled.

&quot;Right, and since I&#39;m a guy, I didn&#39;t think it would be too manly if I 
had to explain to her what to do,&quot; Ranma pointed out.

&quot;But you did such a fine job with Asuka-chan, Dear,&quot; Nodoka smirked.

&quot;That&#39;s what I said,&quot; Asuka said smugly.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Nodoka continued, her eyes sparkling with mischief. &quot;So there 
won&#39;t be any problems explaining to your co-wife what to do then, right, 
Dear?&quot;

&quot;EEP!&quot; Asuka backpedaled. &quot;Actually, Mom, we were thinking that since 
you&#146;re the mom and you&#39;ve had a lot more experience that maybe you could 
explain it to Rei-chan.&quot;

Meanwhile, nobody noticed Rei&#39;s lips compress into a thin line or that 
her eyes had narrowed slightly. They did notice when a loud crash came 
from the backyard.

&quot;I better go check that out,&quot; Ranma said quickly, thankful for the 
excuse.

&quot;Not without me you&#39;re not,&quot; Asuka added hastily.

&quot;My garden!&quot; Nodoka exclaimed, rushing to follow Ranma and Asuka.

Rei stood silently looking at the now empty room. The sound of grinding 
teeth could be heard as her hands clenched into fists.

Outside, Ranma discovered that Taro had decided that today would be a 
good day for a visit. In cursed form, he had crashed through the back 
wall and was trampling Nodoka&#39;s garden. Regrettably for him, he had an 
unfortunate sense of timing.

Before anyone had time to do anything, the shoji doors blew open and out 
stalked a blue-haired fury, complete with glowing red eyes and hair that 
floated around her head as if being blown by a strong updraft.

&quot;Dageki no Shinku Tenshi!&quot; Rei spoke sharply. (Strike of the Crimson 
Angel)

Suddenly, where Taro was standing, a huge, thirty-foot high, 
cross-shaped explosion bloomed violently, launching Taro into LEO and 
forming a ten-foot crater about three feet deep.

&quot;Whoa,&quot; Ranma breathed in awe as he watched Taro disappear in the 
distance, trailing smoke.

&quot;Now then, would someone like to tell me what I need to know, or shall I 
be forced to become...disagreeable?&quot; Rei asked, a clear tone of menace 
in her voice.

Needless to say, Rei was quickly filled in on what she needed to know. 
Further, it was agreed that irritating the crimson-eyed girl when she 
had PMS was definitely in the &#39;for the love of God, please don&#39;t do&#39; 
category.

The End

AN: And so it concludes. I hope you enjoyed it. I know there&#39;s probably 
some questions you are asking at this point.

What happened to the rest of the NGE cast left behind? Who knows? My 
theory is that the NGE universe faded from existence after Ranma was 
pulled home. It never had a true existence. The only reason Rei and 
Asuka became real was because Ranma shared a portion of his soul with 
them. Of course, feel free to divine your own philosophical theory about 
what became of them.

Here&#39;s some food for thought about the future. Ranma has an S2 organ. 
Rei has an S2 organ. Will their kids have one as well? Will Asuka and 
Ranma&#39;s kids have one? How about this thought...Ranma and family move to 
Chofu about 15-20 years before a certain somber sergeant arrives at Jin 
Dai high. A certain tomboy, has teal blue hair and her best friend is 
named Kyouko (which was Asuka&#39;s mother&#39;s name). Coincidence? Perhaps, 
but that, as they say, is another story.

Thank you so much for reading.
