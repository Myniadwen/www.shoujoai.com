<h1>Sailor Hime II: The Supporting Case Strikes Back!</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Fumi,&quot; Mashiro Kazahana called out softly as the
young woman thoughtfully looked out the window, &quot;are
you ready?&quot;

The purple cat raced from the shadows and then jumped
up into her lap, the odd scar on her brow resembling a
circle. &quot;Yes, Miss,&quot; Fumi the cat said to her
worriedly, &quot;but are you sure these are the ones?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re the best choices we have,&quot; Mashiro said
calmly as the wheelchair bound young woman petted the
cat.

Fumi sweatdropped as the cat confessed, &quot;Then I think
we&#39;re in trouble.&quot;

Meanwhile, across campus a group of young women were
settling down to eat lunch in the gardens. Mai Tokhia
set out the bento boxes as Mikoto Minagi looked on
eagerly, Natsuki Kuga settling down with her friends
to eat.

However, they&#39;re not relevent to the story, so we&#39;ll
move on.

Fumi bounded by them through the grass, the little cat
frowning at her boss&#39; decision to pass over such
obvious heroine material. I mean, just going by boob
size alone Mai was prime magical girl material. Still,
she was certain Mashiro knew best.

&quot;Aww,&quot; the voice murmured, &quot;what a cute kitty!&quot;

&#39;Oh no, not again&#39; Fumi thought as she tried to bolt
but it was too late as hands reached out to pick her
up.

Aoi Senou looked her over, the brown haired girl
smiling as she said, &quot;Inexpicably, I have the urge to
call you Fumi. How odd is that?&quot;

&quot;Meow!&quot; Fumi smiled even as her thoughts raced. &#39;She
knows who I am?&#39; she blinked, &#39;Aoi must be one of the
lost Princess Soldiers, the Hime Senshi!&#39;

&quot;Well, well,&quot; Chie Harada used her camera phone to
snap a picture as the black haired girl said, &quot;a cute
kitty and a even cuter girl.&quot;

&quot;Chie,&quot; Aoi blushed.

Fumi wiggled, slipping free from Aoi&#39;s grip and
preparing to flee when there was a large crash as
something knocked over a statue nearby. &#39;Oh no,&#39; she
thought as she saw the shape stumble into view, &#39;it&#39;s
too soon!&#39;

The Orphan roared, it&#39;s misshapen form inspiring fear
and terror in the park&#39;s inhabitants, sending students
fleeing for the hills. Snake like it reared up,
shimmering with eerie energies as it looked around,
then fixated on two people: Aoi and Chie.

&quot;Uh oh.&quot; Chie firmly pushed Aoi behind her as she
said, &quot;I do not like the way it&#39;s looking at you.&quot;

&quot;Chie, no,&quot; Aoi tugged at her, trying to get both of
them away.

Fumi looked around, thankful there were no students
left around. &quot;Aoi, Chie, listen to me!&quot; she cried.

&quot;The cat talked,&quot; Aoi blinked in surprise.

Chie instantly used her camera phone to film Fumi,
&quot;Wait till I sell this to the World Records people!&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no time for that,&quot; Fumi nodded to the nearing
Orphan then leapt. With a twist in midair there was a
odd shimmer, then a shining gold broach and a blue
rose dropped to the ground in front of both girls.

&quot;Pretty,&quot; Aoi conceded, &quot;but...&quot;

&quot;Pick up the broach,&quot; Fumi ordered her, &quot;and yell Hime
Senshi Make-up!&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Aoi frowned at the broach, which carried the
same odd symbol on it as the cat had on it&#39;d forehead.

&quot;NOW.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get touchy,&quot; Aoi chided the cat as she held up
the broach and cried, &quot;Hime Senshi power, make-up!&quot;

In a wave of rainbow power, her clothes disappeared
and Chie snapped a few shots with her camera phone
while muttering, &quot;Nice!&quot;

In a second Aoi stood transformed, her Fuka academy
uniform replaced with a sailor style costume over what
looked like a swimsuit with a mini-skirt. &quot;Eeek,&quot; Aoi
squeaked, trying to yank the skirt down to cover her
bottom. Her hair was pulled back by a golden tiara and
she also had on matching red gloves and boots.

&quot;Damn, Aoi,&quot; Chie murmured admiringly, &quot;you make that
look good.&quot;

Aoi blushed charmingly as Fumi said briskly, &quot;Enough
with the compliments, you need to go fight that
orphan.&quot;

&quot;Alone?&quot; Aoi gulped.

&quot;No, not on your own,&quot; Fumi answered her as she gave
the blue rose and Chie a decidedly pointed look.

Chie met Aoi&#39;s eyes for a moment before she calmly
picked up the mysterious rose. Strangely they could
hear what sounded like a Spanish guitar start playing
in the background as Chie was surrounded by black
sparkles, only to emerge dressed in a pure black
tuxedo, a simple while mask covering her eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m going to have to beat the girl&#39;s off you with a
stick now,&quot; Aoi blurted out, the other girl feeling
her heart beating faster.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Chie said as she strode over to Aoi&#39;s side,
drawing a red rose from her coat as her black lined
with red cape fluttered around her, &quot;but you will
always be my princess.&quot;

&quot;Oh Chie,&quot; Aoi murmured as she took the rose, hearts
in her eyes.

Fumi cleared her throat uncomfortably. &quot;Sorry to
interrupt,&quot; the cat said dryly, &quot;but the Orphan is
still coming.&quot;

&quot;Raaar,&quot; the Orphan said firmly, wanting to get in on
the conversation as it slithered slowly towards them.

&quot;Ready, Aoi?&quot; Chie asked her with a charming smile as
she smoothly drew yet another rose from her clothes.

Aoi smiled back as she answered firmly, &quot;Always,
Chie.&quot; Both turned towards the now visibly worried
Orphan, &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot;

As Fumi watched the two young women charge at the
Orphan she noted, &quot;You know, this might just work out
better than I thought.&quot;

End.

Omake!

Midori Suguira, the teacher still dressed in a nearly
too small Sailor Moon outfit, growled out, &quot;We missed
our chance again!&quot;

&quot;Calm down,&quot; Yohko Sagisawa told her friend, the
school nurse sitting beside her in the room normally
used for student council meetings.

From where Natsuki sat at the head of the table with
Shizuru she said, &quot;The author did say that it was just
starring the supporting cast members.&quot;

&quot;Het, at least you got a cameo,&quot; Midori pointed out to
her irritably.

&quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; Shizuru Fujino said to her with a deceptive
mildness as the woman drank her tea, &quot;talk to my
Natsuki that way.&quot;

&quot;Now, now,&quot; Reito Kanzaki said as he tried to calm
things down.

&quot;Personally, I&#39;m very disappointed,&quot; Haruka Suzushiro
pointed out, &quot;I think I&#39;d make a wonderous Sailor
Uranus.&quot;

&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Yukino Kikukawa corrected mildly.

There was a moment of silence as everyone in the room
processed that revelation. &quot;Sailor Uranus?&quot; Nao smiled
teasingly, &quot;Hinting at something, are we?&quot;

&quot;Not hinting at all,&quot; Haruka answered with surprising
firmness as she continued, &quot;in fact, I intend to ask
Yukino if she&#39;ll be my Sailor Neptune.&quot;

&quot;Haruka,&quot; YUkino breathed out, tears in her eyes then
she all but tackled Haruka out of her chair as she
repeated, &quot;HARUKA!&quot;

&quot;Congradulations,&quot; Shiho Munakata said mildy as they
watched Yukino tackle-glomp Haruka to the ground.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Shizuru agreed.

Mikoto Minagi happily ate her ice cream, provided by
Mai to keep her from asking embarrasing questions at
just such a moment. &quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Miyu Greer noted,
&quot;I would have thought Yukino incapable of such a
strike.&quot;

&quot;It isn&#39;t a take down,&quot; Alyssa Searrs noted as she
drank her tea, &quot;they&#39;re hugging.&quot;

Nao Yuuki slid over to where Natsuki and Shizuru were
sitting as she asked curiously, &quot;I would have thought
that you two would have claimed Uranus and Neptune
first.&quot;

&quot;Shizuru had another suggestion,&quot; Natsuki admitted.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Nao looked curious.

Shizuru smirked, &quot;We&#39;re going to be Mars and Venus, of
course.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Mai Tokhia agreed, shaking her head.

&quot;At least no one has to dress up as those
cross-dressing Starlights,&quot; Nao sighed as she walked
over to sit by Mikoto.

&quot;Well, we already have Akira,&quot; Midori noted, &quot;and I&#39;d
bet you&#39;d look good in a suit.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; both Nao and Akira Okuzaki protested at the
same time.

End, Omake

Notes: First, I blame Guubear for writing &quot;My Terrible
Secret&quot; and giving me the idea of doing a Chie/Aoi
based Sailor Moon fic. I also extend my apologies to
Fumi, but SOMEONE had to be the cat and it couldn&#39;t
really be Mashiro. As for the Omake, Mars and Venus
are often depicted in official manga art looking like
couples, so having Shizuru and Natsuki planning to be
them fit.
