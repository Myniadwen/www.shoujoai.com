<h1>Megatokyo Burning (part 19 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/megaburn-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me,&quot; Minagi said flatly a
few moments later, the blue haired woman staring at
their captive in shock. Her scarred cheeks normally
gave her a oddly cheerful look, but her grim
expression killed that effect.

Mahoro shook her head, the combat android&#39;s black hair
gleaming, &quot;He&#39;s not lying. I could tell if he was.&quot;

Lisa Valante looked around in confusion as the dusky
skinned girl asked, &quot;All right, I&#39;m clearly not
getting something. What&#39;s a third impact and why are
these guys trying to cause one here in Megatokyo?&quot;

Mackie Stingray sighed, the brown haired man helping
tie up their now unconscious captive. &quot;Third impact
was supposed to be humanity returning to it&#39;s innocent
state,&quot; Mackie said to them cynically, &quot;in reality it
just converted everyone within a certain radius back
into a kind of primordial ooze.&quot;

Lisa&#39;s eyes widened., &quot;And they want to do that to
Megatokyo? Are they nuts?&quot;

&quot;It makes a really nasty kind of sense,&quot; Sailor Venus
said grimly. &quot;If they have some way to keep their own
people safe they could plunder the whole city while
the rest of us were helpless,&quot; she mused.

&quot;Not if we can help it,&quot; Minagi vowed while looking
out the hole blown in the side of the elevated train.

&quot;Got a plan?&quot; Lisa asked Mackie quietly.

&quot;Other than get in there,&quot; Mackie nodded towards the
swiftly growing pyramid that was NERV headquarters,
&quot;and stop them? Not a one.&quot;

&quot;Terrific,&quot; Lisa smiled wryly.

The train slowed as it came into the dock, the broken
doors wheezing as they fought to open. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot;
Sailor Venus said as they moved into the dimly lit
corridors, &quot;we probably don&#39;t have much time,&quot;

There was resistance, of course. Nergal troops in
heavy armor guarded the access ways, rifles ready, but
the three warriors handled them wit rediculous ease.
Mahoro struck first, firing away with her heavy
pistol, then either Venus used her chain attack or
Minagi dove in with her energy sword. Either way, they
only left crippled armor and stunned enemies behind.

&quot;We really need a map,&quot; Lisa complained as they raced
down the hallway, their feet thumping the dusty
material.

&quot;We&#39;re just about to the command center,&quot; Mackie said,
the group slowing down to advance forward more
quietly.

Light spilled out of a open door up ahead, lighting up
the dim hallway. Within they could hear voices, men
talking quietly. &quot;We need more time, the boomers
haven&#39;t made enough progress,&quot; one man protested.

&quot;We don&#39;t dare wait much longer,&quot; another man shot
back grimly, &quot;someone reactivated the light rail
service, remember?&quot; A nervous pause, &quot;The AD Police or
their allies could be here any minute.&quot;

A third voice scoffed, &quot;Our private troops caught the
AD Police with their pants down. I personally saw to
it that they won&#39;t be a problem.&quot;

Sailor Venus visibly tensed up, her eyes narrowing
with a barely contained anger. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; she hissed
and with a almost inhuman grace raced through the
doorway, the rest of them hurrying to follow.

&quot;Oh hell,&quot; a lone armored trooper serving as their
bodyguard brought his gun up, finger squeezing on the
trigger.

&quot;Venus Crescent Beam Smash!&quot; a laser like beam lanced
out from Sailor Venus&#39;s hand, blasting the gun away as
her eyes swept the room.

Three men wearing what looked like modified combat
wear gazed at her in shock, while a young woman gazed
at her with eerie blankness. &quot;How did...&quot; the grey
haired man snarled, going for a pistol at his side.

&quot;Don&#39;t even think it,&quot; Lisa drew her AD Police issue
pistol smoothly, &quot;I am really not in a good mood right
now.&quot;

Not listening a third man wearing a Bioware corporate
ID drew his pistol as he yelled, &quot;Rei, code epsilon!&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; the light blue haired girl said, her
eyes eerily glowing red.

BLAM! He fired, bullet whizzing through mid air only
to stop cold as Mahoro stepped in front of it. &quot;That
wasn&#39;t nice,&quot; she said mildly, tossing the bullet she
had caught aside easily, &quot;now, what did you do?&quot;

&quot;Damn it,&quot; he fired at her wildly, &quot;stop!&quot; Mahoro
advanced relentlessly, striding up to him then tearing
the gun from his hands.

Minagi moved like a shot, her energy sword blazing as
she intercepted the third man trying to slip out of
the room, &quot;Don&#39;t even think about it.&quot;

The man who&#39;s name tag identified him as Reed
carefully put the twin containers he was carrying
down, one labeled Adam the other Lilith. &quot;I&#39;m just a
technical consultant,&quot; he admitted, &quot;just doing my
job.&quot;

&quot;What did you do?&quot; Mackie demanded grimly, grabbing
the Bioware officer by the collar and slamming him up
against a wall.

&quot;She&#39;s our Galatea,&quot; he sneered at Mackie, &quot;Ayanami
has been engineered to link to every boomer in the
city. And now she&#39;s ordered them all to go insane.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Sailor Venus growled.

&quot;Lisa, radio,&quot; Mackie ordered quickly.

&quot;AD Police units,&quot; Lisa started only to jerk her head
back as she heard a scream, quickly cut off.
Fragmentary messages of battle, death and chaos came
over the airways, crackling through static but clearly
horrible.

&quot;Stop this,&quot; Minagi grabbed the Ayanami clone by the
shoulders, shaking the woman but she didn&#39;t respond.

&quot;She can&#39;t,&quot; Reed said quietly, &quot;she&#39;s not sentient.
That commend shut her down right after she gave the
attack order.&quot;

Mahoro gazed at the two officers in shock, &quot;You must
have had a shut down ready... what is your own people
were caught up in the attacks?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re expendable,&quot; the first man sniffed coldly.

&quot;We&#39;ve got to do something,&quot; Lisa said weakly, her
radio still picking up the cries of terror and sounds
of combat from above.

&quot;Didn&#39;t Tokyo-3 have a defensive system?&quot; Mahoro
suggested tentatively.

Mackie&#39;s eyes widened a bit, &quot;Of course.&quot; He rushed
towards the control panels as he said, &quot;Lisa, I&#39;ll
need a hand!&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Minagi murmured admiringly as the two computer
hackers wenbt to work, valiantly trying to bring the
old systems on line.

Lisa typed away, frowning in concentration before
finally bursting out, &quot;Where is the main processor,
damn it?!&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Sailor Venus asked, warily guarding their three
guests.

&quot;The computers should have a central core processor,&quot;
Mackie sounded frustrated, &quot;in fact the Magi were
supposed to have three. But I can&#39;t connect to any of
them! It&#39;s like they&#39;re not there.&quot;

&quot;And without the core we can&#39;t bring the defences on
line?&quot; Mahoro guessed.

&quot;Maybe not...&quot; Mackie paused, a odd look on his face.
He seemed to wrestle with the idea a moment then said,
&quot;I need a access cable.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Lisa scrambled around in her pockets then the
experienced hacker hauled out the multipurpose cable.

&quot;Hope you don&#39;t want this back,&quot; Mackie muttered as he
rolled up his sleeve then stuck the cable right into
his arm.

&quot;Ewww,&quot; Lisa squealed as there was a splurt of red,
then the unique boomer internal fluid coming from the
hole.

&quot;Boomer?&quot; Sailor Venus raised a eyebrow.

&quot;A unique one,&quot; Minagi noted, having some knowledge of
his background, &quot;he&#39;s human in all the ways that
matter.&quot;

&quot;According to Nene, better,&quot; Mahoro smirked.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Lisa apologized for her first reaction.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Mackie said. He took a deep breath,
&quot;I&#39;m going to try plugging directly into the system.
Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to get access that way.&quot;

&quot;Is this safe?&quot; Minagi asked, studying him seriously.

&quot;No,&quot; Mackie said with complete honestly as he plugged
the cable into one of the terminal&#39;s access ports.
