<h1>The Tale of the Fair Ogress and the Puss in Boots (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/fade.html">Fade</a><br> </h2>
<pre>AN: I was on the shoujo ai forum when I saw the topic &#145;What was your 
twistiest idea for a fanfic &#145;til now&#146;, or something like that. At the 
time, apart from my &#145;Setsuna&#146;s advice&#146;, I was out of really good ideas, 
since I was more in a heroic-fantasy drawing mood lately. So I didn&#146;t 
answer. But, something like thirty minutes later, the idea of a SM/Shrek 
crossover struck me. Very hard! Look, look! It&#146;s still open! Does 
someone have some Band-Aid? It&#146;s not like I have something against 
chibi-blood-geysers, but they tend to be rather messy. If only I knew 
how to do black sausages... Anyway, after thirty other minutes or so, I 
had figured almost every characters and bits of the story assaulted my 
damaged mind (I take advantage of this little moment to say that, no, I 
don&#146;t take any illegal substance and consume the legal ones quite 
reasonably, my insanity is 100% natural, I think...). So, even though 
I&#146;m usually not a very big fan of crossovers, I was laughing evilly by 
myself while getting home for dinner... Sorry to take so long, on with 
the story. Please, review! Me love reviews! Warning! Major OOC!

Prologue: Condition

An imposing shadow fell on a mirror hanging on the wall. Quite low on 
the wall, actually. A swirling smoke was dancing into it, creating 
mystical patterns. &#147;O mirror, magic mirror! I summon you!&#148; The loud and 
self- important voice of the shadow&#146;s owner rang in the vast and richly 
decorated room.

&#147;... No woman, no cries, No woman, no criiies...&#148; Was the only answer. A 
leather-gloved hand balled in a tight fist, crushed the delicate rose it 
was holding. Another similarly clothed hand grabbed a smaller hand 
mirror lying on a nearby oaken table. It handed the smaller mirror to 
the hooded, feminine figure that was patiently waiting behind the lord 
of the castle.

The hooded woman silently produced a diamond ring and began to cut the 
glass with swift, neat slashes.

Another female figure promptly appeared in the magic mirror. The lady 
was crushing her hands on her ears, her eyes tightly shut, as if in 
great pain. A bohemian dress clung loosely to her gorgeous body and 
revealed a generous cleavage while a simple leather belt hugged her thin 
waist. Her skin was of the most appetizing mocha. She had long dark hair 
with green hues. Once again, the lord and his executioner inwardly 
wondered if it could actually be due to some muss, dreadlocks weren&#146;t 
exactly known for being sterile...

The music stopped as she yelled. &#147;STOP THAT! You monster! I can hear it 
scream! Stop dammit! Oh man...&#148;

The lord smirked, but held up a hand to stop the executioner. The mirror 
entity opened her startling red eyes to glare at him. Still smiling, he 
leaned his handsome face closer to the mirror, his feature clearly 
promising a hell of inventive tortures. She had to avert her eyes first.

&#147;Okay, okay, so waddya want man?&#148; She asked, defeated.

&#147;Mmmh?!?&#148;

&#147;Oh, alright! Of what help may I be to you, my lord?&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s better. Remember that you are here only to serve me. I expect 
you not to make me wait when I call you, Setsuna. Time is flying and I 
have other matters to attend to! My precious roses are waiting for me, 
for instance.&#148;

Behind him, the executioner rolled her eyes and Setsuna barely 
suppressed the urge to imitate her. Instead, she bowed deeply, 
successfully hiding her face from her lord. &#147;I apologize, Prince 
Endymion. This will not be repeated.&#148;

&#147;Good, good. Now, let&#146;s talk business. I need you to help me find a 
woman!&#148;

At this, Setsuna quickly straightened up, here eyes widening. &#147;WHAT? Did 
something happen to Fiore?&#148;

&#147;No, no...&#148; He answered, slightly irritated. &#147;The Royal Gardener is 
fine. He was actually most pleased when I offered him a dozen bags of 
the finest fertilizer for his birthday two days ago.&#148; He smiled at the 
memory of his own present for this. &#147;Anyway, my mother sent me a letter, 
I have one month to marry a woman if I want to inherit. The damn rich 
hag! So, I need to find some princess, you know, to dust the castle, 
take care of the brat...&#148;

&#147;Oh...&#148; Was Setsuna&#146;s rather stupid answer. &#147;Man, you&#146;re in big 
trouble!&#148; She fished a small cone of paper filled with aromatic herbs in 
her dreadlocks, stuck it in her mouth, lit it up and sucked on it 
blissfully. Her face stretched in a smile that had a somewhat glazed, 
intemporal quality to it. &#147;Let&#146;s see what I&#146;ve got in store for you 
man!&#148; And she blew a large amount of smoke, her figure disappearing, 
slowly clouded, as reggae music made itself heard again.

&#147;Our first very lucky candidate is Queen Berryl!&#148; The picture of a woman 
clad in red and black leather and expertly wielding an impressive whip 
appeared. &#147;Very strong personality, a lot of land and devoted subjects. 
Very wealthy family too. However, her previous husbands never seemed to 
last very long...&#148;

&#147;Oh? How many times did she get married?&#148; Endymion asked curiously.

&#147;About fifty-eight times, officially. Her last husband died two weeks 
ago.&#148;

&#145;Why did she have to say it so cheerfully?&#146; The young lord visibly 
paled. &#147;Hum, I don&#146;t think that such a beautiful lady needs to be 
bothered with another wedding, she must still be in mourning.&#148;

&#147;Rriiight! Next in line is Princess Makoto.&#148; A new picture replaced the 
previous one.

&#147;Hey! I know her! She kicked my butt when I... Hum! Anyway, I can&#146;t 
possibly marry her. What would I look like standing beside such a giant, 
the whole court will mock me!&#148; Not to mention that she promised him she 
would impale him if they ever met again, he added mentally.

&#147;I heard you say to the Royal Gardener that size didn&#146;t matter...&#148; The 
executioner cheerfully piped in, surprising the other two, who had 
completely forgotten about her.

The prince turned around and glared at his newest employee. &#147;You are 
dismissed, young Hotaru. You may go and torture some rebels...&#148;

The executioner bowed and left the room quietly under the icy glare of 
her lord, not without mumbling something about trying to be helpful 
though. In the mirror dimension, Setsuna was tearing her guts apart with 
laughter. She just had the time to recompose herself before Endymion 
turned back to her.

&#147;Okay, then our last candidate is princess Minako.&#148; The new picture that 
formed in the mirror was truly enchanting. Breathtaking, in fact. The 
blonde was the most beautiful woman the prince had ever laid his eyes 
upon. Her own baby blue eyes were captivating. She carried herself with 
grace and elegance, she was perfect. &#147;Her kingdom is also extremely rich 
and she is said to hold the key of a tremendous power!&#148; By now, the 
young prince was over the moon. &#147;But she has been kidnapped by a 
fearsome dragon and is now held captive in a dark castle. Every attempt 
to free her has been met by a fatal issue.&#148; This last comment brought 
him back crashing on Earth.

&#147;Oh well, it can&#146;t be helped then... Anyone else?&#148;

&#147;No, sorry. We have some trouble with the factory...&#148;

Endymion sighed. &#147;Then I shall appoint a worthy champion for this most 
honourable quest. Any suggestion?&#148;

&#147;Err, man, you certainly have the best army of gardeners, but I doubt 
that any of them would succeed...&#148;

&#147;There must be someone able to take on this dragon though! This is a 
fairy tale, for god&#146;s sakes! Anyone would do!&#148;

&#147;Well, in that case, there IS someone...&#148;</pre>
