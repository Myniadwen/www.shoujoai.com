<a href="../crossover/sillyass-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Utena gave the door a shove, managing to get it open by brute force. 
They looked at the pile blocking their way, and Utena sighed, &quot;Anthy, 
get the shovel.&quot;

&quot;So many boxes of chocolate for you, Utena-sama,&quot; Anthy said, wide 
eyed. A bit of shoveling and the boxes were inside the dorm, and the 
two of them began to sort out the boxes.

&quot;Please be mine, Utena, from Miyuki,&quot; a frowning Utena read the card 
aloud, wondering which girl that was.

&quot;That&#39;s the girl with the whip, I think,&quot; Anthy said as she calmly 
sipped her tea. Utena paled and tossed the box into the &#39;don&#39;t send a 
thank you card&#39; pile.

&quot;One for you,&quot; Utena passed it over to Anthy.

Anthy flipped the card open, and sighed softly, &quot;Saionji.&quot; She tossed 
the box into the &#39;do not open until doomsday&#39; pile.

&quot;I wonder if anyone else at Ohtori has this problem,&quot; Utena sighed. 

**********************

Haruka looked at the piles of boxes with a smirk on her face.

Michiru shook her head. &quot;I hope you&#39;re proud of yourself,&quot; she sighed.

Haruka looked thoughtful, &quot;You know, I think I am.&quot;

Michiru whapped her upside the head.

&quot;Ow!&quot; Haruka winced. 

**********************

Miki vigorously stacked the boxes on the bed, in the hopes of actually 
getting out of the dorm room soon. He was blushing faintly, from 
occasionally reading some of the cards attached. He flinched, reading 
another one.

&quot;Mine always, love, Kozue,&quot; it read. 

**********************

Touga smiled, typing numbers into his calculator as his girl groupies 
labored, stacking boxes of chocolates just behind him. &quot;I&#39;m certain I 
have the most female fans in Ohtori,&quot; he crowed.

One girl groupie whispered to another, &quot;Has he read all the &#39;I hate 
you, you cad&#39; cards that are in there yet?&quot;

Another whispered back, &quot;Probably not.&quot;

&quot;No one in Ohtori is more popular than I,&quot; Touga laughed.

A third girl groupie rolled her eyes. &quot;Has anyone been over to see 
Juri&#39;s room?&quot; she asked the others quietly.

She got a few odd looks, &quot;Why?&quot;

A smirk, &quot;Touga is definitely in second place, this year.&quot; 

**********************

Juri sighed wearily, glad to be finally on her way to classes. &quot;I 
can&#39;t believe I got that many chocolates,&quot; she muttered.

Adoring young ladies lined the sidewalk, looking at Juri with hearts 
in their eyes. Thankfully, they weren&#39;t all carrying those lunch boxes 
again. Last time had been bad enough!

She pushed the door to the fencing hall open, and froze. &quot;Good 
morning, Juri-sama,&quot; one of her fencers smiled, stacking up boxes of 
chocolates.

&quot;What&#39;s all this?&quot; Juri asked, rather suspecting she knew the answer.

&quot;Chocolates for you,&quot; Ami Mizuno shrugged, &quot;I guess they&#39;re from girls 
who were too shy to take them to your dorm room.&quot;

Juri groaned softly.

&quot;If it helps any,&quot; Ami said with a little blush, &quot;I got a pile of 
boxes, too.&quot;

&quot;Ami!&quot; Minako squealed, and glomped her.

&quot;You&#39;ve been hanging around Wakaba too much,&quot; Ami managed. 

**********************

Asuka pushed her door open, only to freeze.

Rei Ayanami reclined on their bed, chocolate syrup spread all over her 
pale body. &quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s Day,&quot; she smirked.

Asuka sweatdroped, &quot;Rei, you are such a hentai,&quot; and firmly shut the 
door behind her. 

**********************

Hikaru blinked, as both Umi and Fuu dragged her into the closet. 
&quot;Happy Valentines day,&quot; Fuu kissed her firmly.

Before Hikaru could recover, Umi gently cupped her face, &quot;Happy 
Valentines Day,&quot; and kissed her too.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Hikaru managed.
