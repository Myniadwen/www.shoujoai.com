<h1>Bubblegum Hime (part 2 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/bubblehime-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The massive wreckage of the fallen Orphan still
smouldered in the forest, the stink wafting up towards
the morning sky. Masashi Takeda, the black haired
leader of the volunteer police of Fuka academy
grimaced angrily as he muttered, &quot;The damn Hime
Soldiers beat us to the fight again!&quot;

&quot;You sure you want to take one of these yourself?&quot;
Chie Harada noted, pushing up her stylish glasses as
the boyish young woman filmed the scene.

&quot;I&#39;m sure a kendoist like myself could manage,&quot;
Takeda said defensively. He yawned then added, &quot;I need
a coffee.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Kazuya Kurauchi said mildly, the brown
haired young man overseeing the Orphan disposal team.

&quot;And why do I have to do this?&quot; Nao Yuuki gripped as
the small redhead tied ropes to the Orphan to help
drag it away.

&quot;Because they&#39;ve gotten tired of sending you to the
church for your delinquency,&quot; Takeda growled, &quot;and
dumped you on us.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Nao grumbled.

&quot;All right, I think I&#39;ve got enough pictures,&quot; Chie
reported, &quot;what&#39;s next?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll write up the report for the student council,&quot;
Takeda said with a grimace, &quot;and bring it to Chief
Suzushiro.&quot;

Chie dropped her voice, &quot;You ever get the feeling the
Chief knows more about the Hime than she&#39;s letting
on?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Takeda shrugged slightly as he said, &quot;but
what do I do? It&#39;s not like I can confront her about
it.&quot;

Chie nodded slightly, &quot;True. I&#39;ll but my gossip
network to look into it, see what I can come up with.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Takeda smiled.

&quot;You know,&quot; Nao purred as she stroked Kazuya&#145;s arm,
&quot;I&#39;m sure a big strong man like you wouldn&#39;t need
little old me&#39;s help moving this....&quot;

&quot;Nao....&quot; a angry young woman growled as Akane popped
up from where she had been helping with Orphan
disposal, the brown haired girl glaring dangerously.

&quot;Akane, I didn&#39;t...&quot; Kazuya paled.

&quot;I&#39;ll deal with you later,&quot; Akane said as she
advanced on Nao, &quot;she&#39;s first.&quot;

&quot;Are you going to save her?&quot; Chie asked as Akane
chased Nao by where they stood.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Takeda smiled slightly as they ran by the
other way, &quot;eventually.&quot;

A little later that day, Mai Tokhia raced through the
Linden Baum restaurant, carrying trays of food on both
arms. &quot;Akane,&quot; the redhead whimpered, &quot;why did you
have to have Orphan clean up duty on a busy day like
this?&quot;

&quot;Hello, Mai,&quot; Reito Kanzaki smiled as she delivered
his food, &quot;you look especially lovely today.&quot;

&quot;Flirt,&quot; Mai smiled as she dropped off his food,
&quot;don&#39;t exaggerate.&quot;

&quot;But Mai, I only speak the truth,&quot; Reito put his hand
to his chest dramatically.

&quot;Better not keep that up, senpai,&quot; Yuuichi Tate noted
from where he sat nearby, &quot;I understand Mikoto can get
fierce if she thinks Mai&#39;s in danger.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Reito smirked, &quot;as I think you
discovered first hand.&quot;

Yuuichi flushed, remembering the beating he had
gotten for touching Mai&#39;s breasts. &quot;It was a
accident,&quot; he whimpered.

&quot;We&#39;re back,&quot; Akane called as she hurried inside
along with her boyfriend Kazuya.

&quot;Thank goodness,&quot; Mai sighed, &quot;the new girl&#39;s been
nearly useless.&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Midori Sugiura protested as the redhead helped
customers nearby.

&quot;I&#39;ll be out in a second,&quot; Akane added as she grabbed
her uniform and raced in back to change clothes.

In a corner table Natsuki rose, her black hair
flowing as she said, &quot;Thanks for the meal.&quot;

Shizuru smiled, her eyes twinkling as she noted, &quot;I
think that&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen fries eaten with
mayonnaise before.&quot;

Natsuki blushed, &quot;I like them that way.&quot;

Shizuru&#39;s eyes twinkled naughtily as she said, &quot;Well,
it&#39;s a important discovery. Just think of all the uses
I could put mayo to.....&quot;

&quot;Shizuru!&quot; Natsuki blushed. &quot;I&#39;ll see you tonight,&quot;
she added as she hurried off.

&quot;Ah just love teasing that girl,&quot; Shizuru sighed to
herself happily as she watched Natsuki&#39;s very fine
butt as she was walking away.

Takeda sighed in relief as he reached the restaurant,
glad his morning duties of cleaning up Orphans was
finally over. Reaching for the door he was bowled over
by a figure racing outside and sent crashing to the
ground.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Takeda growled as he struggled up to his feet.

&quot;What?&quot; Natsuki turned, eyes flashing.

&quot;Natsuki?&quot; Takeda blinked, a blush coloring his
cheeks. &quot;Fancy meeting you here?&quot;

&quot;What do you want?&quot; Natsuki demanded.

&quot;Would you like to share a coffee with me...?&quot; Takeda
asked tentatively.

&quot;Buzz off,&quot; Natsuki turned to walk away.

&quot;How about a date tonight?&quot; Takeda reached out to
grab her arm.

Natsuki spun towards him, eyes flashing as she
hissed, &quot;Die!&quot;

Within the restaurant everyone heard a massive crash.
&quot;Did you just hear a howl of ultimate suffering?&quot;
Yuuichi asked, blinking.

&quot;Natsuki&#39;s signature move,&quot; Reito nodded wisely.

&quot;Ah,&quot; Yuuichi nodded as he went back to his meal.

A few moments a battered and bloody Takeda was
assisted inside by two passerby. &quot;What have I told you
about bothering Natsuki?&quot; Haruka asked her subordinate
with a sigh.

&quot;Don&#39;t do it?&quot; Takeda sighed.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Yukino agreed. They deposited the boy in a
seat then continued on, finding a booth where they
could sit together.

&quot;I almost feel sorry for him,&quot; Haruka noted, &quot;though
I can&#39;t believe how blind he is, not seeing that
Shizuru and Natsuki are together.&quot;


&quot;It did take you a bit to see that, too,&quot; Yukino
noted slyly.

Haruka blushed. The two of them had walked in on
Shizuru and Natsuki in an intimate moment, as they
say, and Haruka had been shocked. Thankfully Yukino
had dragged her away before she could say anything too
stupid, and she had eventually accepted the situation.

&quot;I&#39;m sort of glad that happened, though,&quot; Haruka
confessed.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Yukino blinked.

Haruka smiled slightly, &quot;Because I wouldn&#39;t have
realized how I felt about you if that hadn&#39;t
happened.&quot;

&quot;Haruka,&quot; Yukino blushed charmingly.</pre>
