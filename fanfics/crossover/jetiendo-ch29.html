<a href="../crossover/jetiendo-ch28.html">Back to Part 28</a><pre>Ash and May was at the hospital bed of Max presents for Max stacked on 
his left and cards across the shelf.

&quot;Merry Christmas little brother,&quot; May said to the sick Max &quot;I was hoping 
that every one else would be here,&quot;

&quot;Hey don&#39;t worry they might be busy&quot; Ash answered. &quot;Hey Davis is here.&quot; 
The door opened. Davis came in with a hyper Christmas spirit.

&quot;Ash&quot; Davis cried, &quot;you&#39;re here, merry Christmas dude, you two wrote 
good chapters on Harry Potter, Ant and Dec read them out in front of the 
whole class he sent them to Jade Radcliffe. &quot;

&quot;Did they&quot; Ash asked

&quot;Yeah&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s pretty cool&quot; May reply.

Then the military opened the door,

&quot;Times up&quot; the soldier said dragging Davis out

&quot;See you in the new year&quot; Ash said.

&quot;Yeah&quot; Davis said as he was thrown out of the room.

May and Ash where all alone with Max again as they where about to fall 
into a kiss Max woke up and began to walk,

&quot;Kissy, kissy, kissy&quot;

&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; May screamed at Max

&quot;Max&quot; Ash shouted out with relief to calm May down.

Then someone opened the door, Kotono she was dressed in green a red 
headband and brown leather boots.

&quot; I&#39;m going to the tournament,&quot; Kotono said &quot;no one might see me again, 
we have to kill this time to create peace.&quot;

&quot; Good luck&quot; Ash said to her &quot;im sure every one in the trip would 
support you&quot;

&quot;Thank you&quot; Kotono replied with her ninja dart and dagger in her hand as 
she left. As she turned their back on them she said this &quot; they&#39;re right 
what they said about you, you do look like your father and have your 
mothers eyes&quot;

Then that was it, Kotono gone heading for her fight for peace, fight the 
traitors Sirou and Rei.

The fighting king Jado was the one who needed to be exterminated.

Then Tasha came in, the heir to the throne came in a silver ring on her 
marriage finger, and she was engaged to Gary at last.
