<h1>Jetiendo (part 8 of 38)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/jetiendo-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>The city was packed it was almost like Las Vegas in the place they where 
in the place they where at. It was a great night out 

&quot;GRINAL&quot; shouted T.K 

&quot; Grizzly&quot; roared Kari 

&quot;DOUBLE THE TROUBLE WITH GRINAL&quot; T.K boomed 

&quot; EVERY ONE ON THE SLABS GUYS &quot;boomed Kari as she was impersonating Mr 
Grinal. 

&quot;Please don&#39;t impersonate my voice Karen&quot; replied T.K 

&quot;WHO THREW THIS FUCKING PEN AT ME?&quot; 

&quot; GRRRINNNNNNNALLLLLLLLLLLLL!&quot; boomed T.K in his loudest voice hear. 

&quot;PAAAAAAKIIIIIIIII!&quot; Kari screamed. 

&quot; IT&#39;S PRONOUNCED PAY-KEY,&quot; 

&quot; WHOLEGRAIN&quot; 

&quot;SPOONA SPOONED HIS MOTHER!&quot; 

&quot; WE DO NOT BULLY TEACHERS, is all understood?&quot; 

&quot; Yeah, Spoona spooned his mom in wholegrain and Grinal was there he saw 
though his very eyes&quot; 

&quot; Is that your idea of romance&quot; May asked in a shock 

&quot; Yeah&quot; Kari hissed &quot; and it feels good&quot; 

&quot; Why don&#39;t we dance May? &quot; Ash asked 

&quot; Yeah&quot; May replied. 

&quot; See you two in the stars&quot; Kari screamed, &quot; T.K and I will be in the 
sun&quot; 

May stuck her middle finger up at Kari. As Ash and May danced away, T.K 
and Kari drank the bottles of vodka that Ash and May did not touch to 
avoid getting drunk. 

Then T.K and Kari stood on the table singing karaoke. A song called 
don&#39;t go breaking my heart.&#39; 

Despite them two catching a lot of attention Ash and May had firm eye 
contact. 

An hour later they finally noticed that T.K and Kari where seeking their 
attention. Ash and May then found something they least expected to find: 
their parents at the bar while they were looking quite sad. Ash also 
noticed that his aunt was there too along with other people. May and Ash 
found the chance to sneak and find out what they where talking about 
they went to the nearest table they could as they tried to listen about 
what&#39;s going on. 

&quot; This is it.&quot; Professor Oak said, &quot; The world is in danger.&quot; 

&quot; The rest of the continents are in civil wars and international wars. &quot; 

Mrs Kamiya gasped, &quot; Lazy Asian politicians took no action.&quot; 

&quot; Six atomic bombs have fallen on Asia &quot; Professor Ivy announced, &quot; This 
war is nearly destroying the entire planet. We are fortunate enough that 
none have landed on Jetiendo or Japan, but terrorism has increased 
dramatically.&quot; 

&quot; The world has enough problems as they are&quot; Mr Sirou added who had 
always been quiet on the trip &quot; Global Warming, High Debt, Job losses, 
Taxes, individuals but a war the war to end all wars I&#39;m afraid has 
clearly begun 

. &quot; 

&quot; I hope that your countries pull through like the previous World War &quot; 
Rei from the trip said. 

Ash and May heard words they did not want to hear the war to end all 
wars. Since T.K and Kari where to drunk to notice a disgusting secret 
such as that 

&quot; What do we tell them?&quot; Ash asked, &quot; They&#39;d think we&#39;re mental&quot; 

&quot; We can tell someone like Tasha but T.K and Kari are not sober enough 
to tell them straight&quot; May replied 

&quot; MAY! Ash snapped, &quot; THERE&#39;S A WORLD WAR III COMING UP AND WE HAVE TO 
KEEP QUIET ... sorry May I didn&#39;t mean to shout&quot; 

&quot; That&#39;s alright&quot; May replied calmly. &quot; Why don&#39;t we go gambling? 
There&#39;s a roulette thing over there&quot; 

&quot; We ain&#39;t got no money&quot; Ash replied. 

&quot; I got 10 dollars&quot; May replied &quot; stole it from Grinal&quot; 

&quot; Yeah&quot; Ash replied
