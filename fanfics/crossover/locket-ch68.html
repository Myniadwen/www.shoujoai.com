Alpha smiled cheerfully as she collected another
order, then the green haired young lady smoothly took
off through the crowd, her simple slacks and blouse
comfortable on her slim form. She went past the bar,
quickly waving to Mahoro then went into the kitchen as
she called out, &quot;I&#39;ve got another order.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ukyo took the note from her, the black
haired martial artist smiling slightly, her tunic and
pants giving her a boyish air. Nearby Shampoo
carefully tended the noodles, the busty cook humming
away to herself happily.

&quot;Shampoo likes Alpha&#39;s notes,&quot; she noted, &quot;writes very
neatly.&quot;

&quot;Oh, thank you,&quot; Alpha felt herself blush faintly.

Makoto Kino chuckled from where the brown haired
amazon was grilling burgers. &quot;The orders should be
ready in a few minutes,&quot; she flipped the paddies,
&quot;though Sasami is going to owe us for covering for her
tonight.&quot;

&quot;Sugar, she and Minagi don&#39;t go out that often,&quot; Ukyo
reminded her, &quot;I don&#39;t mind working a bit harder than
usual for her sake.&quot;

&quot;Besides which,&quot; Alpha added thoughtfully, &quot;everyone
likes Sasami.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Shampoo chuckled, finishing up the meals. She
carefully handed the loaded plates over to Alpha,
&quot;Here you go.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; then Alpha swept out into the noise of the
busy bar once again.

Arisugawa&#39;s Locket was busy for a winter night, a thin
layer of snow having already fallen on the city of
Tokyo. Alpha had already been out into the snow on a
shopping expedition with Juri&#39;s business manager Tendo
Nabiki, filling a list of items for Miss May as well
as taking a bit of time to see the sights.

Alpha was used to the quiet world that she came from,
a place where the population was in decline and they
were surrounded by the remnants of an advanced age,
and she wasn&#39;t at all sure she liked this busy, almost
noisy world. In compensation, Alpha did find she liked
the staff of the Locket and looked forward to making
friends with them all.

A group of young women came in from outside, carrying
athletic bags and Hitomi recognized them as part of
the local martial arts crowd. &quot;Welcome to Arisugawa&#39;s
Locket,&quot; the brown haired girl bowed with a smile.

&quot;Hi,&quot; the sleek, black haired young woman smiled back.
She was good looking, her short pageboy haircut making
her look decidedly butchy, even without the jeans and
leather jacket that she was wearing.

&quot;Yurie-sama,&quot; the little blonde took her hand, tugging
her forward gently, &quot;we need to see if we can grab a
table.&quot;

&quot;Right, Ririko,&quot; Yurie answered, the two women moving
through the crowd towards the tables to one side of
the dance floor, nearby the library. Luckily a group
was leaving as they arrived, the two claming it for
their fellow students at the dojo.

Ririko smiled as Yurie held a chair out for her,
settling down with a happy sigh. She watched Yurie
smoothly sit then quietly said, &quot;I wonder what the
odds are, the two of us meeting again in a dojo like
this....&quot;

Tilting her head to the side Yurie studied her
thoughtfully before murmuring, &quot;I suppose it&#39;s quite a
gift of fate, really.&quot; She smiled faintly, &quot;I missed
you, when you quit our high school karate club a few
years ago.&quot;

Ririko looked down, blushing faintly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she
said gently, &quot;I was just so confused.. and with my
feelings for you, it made figuring out things even
harder.&quot;

&quot;I thought you were interested in men,&quot; Yurie said
softly.

Ririko shook her head, a blush coloring her cheeks.
&quot;When I met Mitsuru it was the first time I was
attracted to a man,&quot; she confessed, &quot;I just wish I had
realized it was because he was dressed as a woman at
the time.&quot;

&#39;Gee, I would almost think that they were talking
about Juri&#39;s friend Aoi,&#39; Keiko thought, feeling just
a bit guilty over eavesdropping. Approaching the table
she bowed, brown braid bouncing as she asked, &quot;Is
there anything I can get you?&quot;

&quot;Beer,&quot; Yurie said crisply, then Ririko ordered a
glass of wine. Retrieving them from the bar Keiko
bowed again, getting an absent minded thank you from
Yurie.

&quot;Yurie?&quot; Ririko asked softly as the silence stretched.

&quot;Here&#39;s where I get to make a confession,&quot; Yurie
smiled in a self-mocking sort of way, &quot;I actually
dated a guy after we broke up.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re serious,&quot; Ririko gazed at her in surprise.

Yurie chuckled softly, &quot;It&#39;s not quite as bad as
you&#39;re thinking.&quot; She drank a bit of beer as she
admitted, &quot;It was Shun Kisaragi.&quot;

Ririko gaped at her, then they both burst out
laughing, &quot;The boy who looks exactly like a girl?&quot;
Ririko managed to get past her giggles.

&quot;Shun was adorable, too,&quot; Yurie remembered, &quot;but I
just couldn&#39;t get past the fact that he had a... you
know.&quot;

&quot;I guess we were both taken in by the false flowers of
Ryokuto,&quot; Ririko agreed. They sat there in
companionable silence for awhile, listening to the
music from the dance floor nearby.

&quot;Ririko, I was wondering...&quot; Yurie started.

&quot;I wanted to ask you something...&quot; Ririko began.

Both woman stopped, looked at each other and then
laughed softly. With a smile and a gentlemanly wave of
her hand Yurie said, &quot;You first.&quot;

Taking a breath to calm her nerves Ririko asked, &quot;I
know it&#39;s been a long time.. but would you like to go
out with me?&quot; A smile, &quot;Not really a date, just a
chance to catch up with each other.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Yurie smiled, &quot;I&#39;ve missed you.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Ririko agreed.

&quot;That&#39;s so adorable,&quot; May murmured, taking a moment to
join her lover Keiko at one of the tables. Both looked
tired but oddly content, sitting there with cups of
tea.

&quot;Just like you are,&quot; Keiko agreed, squeezing her
lover&#39;s hand. She looked up at the slightly taller
brown haired woman, &quot;So how do you feel, running the
bar tonight?&quot;

&quot;Nervous,&quot; May admitted. She smiled, her maid uniform
as spotlessly clean as always, &quot;I do wonder why Juri
didn&#39;t ask Nabiki or Hitomi to run things, they&#39;ve
been working with her longer.&quot;

&quot;You really don&#39;t see it, do you?&quot; Keiko looked at May
fondly, her eyes twinkling with joy. &quot;Juri trusts you,
May, it&#39;s not about seniority or anything else,&quot; she
explained.

May looked down, blushing, unable to think of anything
to say.

Not far away Nenene Sumerigawa smiled as she looked
across at her dinner companion. &quot;You know,&quot; the brown
haired young woman in the nice dress murmured, &quot;I
didn&#39;t expect you to ask me out.&quot;

Maggie King blushed faintly, her short black hair
neatly styled and black suit crisp. &quot;I&#39;ve wanted to
for awhile,&quot; Maggie confessed softly, &quot;but you seemed
so down when Yomiko left....&quot;

&quot;So this is.. a pity dinner?&quot; Nenene asked flatly.

&quot;No,&quot; Maggie looked down then continued awkwardly,
&quot;I... really care about you.&quot;

Nenene gave Maggie a searching look, then her lips
rose in a slight smile. &quot;Me too,&quot; she reached out to
squeeze the taller woman&#39;s hand.

Hesitantly Maggie asked, &quot;Would you like to dance?&quot;

Nenene got up, taking Maggie&#39;s had to lead her over to
the dance floor. Maggie led smoothly, dancing
surprisingly well as Nenene almost seemed to melt
against her.
