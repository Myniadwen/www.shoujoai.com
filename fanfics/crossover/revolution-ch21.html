<a href="../crossover/revolution-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>Dorothy Catalonia smiled as she strode through the medical research
facility, the lovely blonde making a striking figure dressed in her
uniform. &quot;Is she ready?&quot; Dorothy asked her lieutenant calmly, gazing
at the brown haired woman thoughtfully.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; the black haired young woman nodded, keeping pace easily
and carrying a clipboard at her side. &quot;I understand her psychiatrist
is still dubious about using her in the field, however,&quot; she added.

&quot;I&#39;m not interested in her as a warrior, Helen,&quot; Dorothy said dryly,
&quot;she&#39;s more of a psychological warfare tool.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Helen acknowledged. The crisply dressed young woman
looked faintly uncomfortable, &quot;She refuses to have the facial scar
removed.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s her choice,&quot; Dorothy acknowledged as they reached the end of the
hallway. She knocked firmly and called, &quot;May we come in?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; the woman answered.

The sunroom was brightly lit, the light streaming in from the glass
windows, a garden stretching out just beyond the glass. Chairs were
set up around the comfortable room, and the scent of roses lingered in
the air. Sitting by the window a young woman with violet hair gazed
out at the garden, her skin pale from long illness.

&quot;Good morning, Shiori,&quot; Dorothy said calmly.

Shiori looked up calmly, her eyes oddly cold and remote. Her nightgown
swirled as she rose, the scar on her cheek only becoming visible as
she moved. Burned into her cheek was a rose crest, much like the one
she now wore on her finger, both red as blood. &quot;Have you found her...
my dear Juri?&quot; she asked softly.

&quot;Yes we have,&quot; Dorothy told her, &quot;she&#39;s a pilot with the colonies now.&quot;

&quot;A pilot?&quot; Shiori blinked, &quot;It seems too harsh for her.&quot;

Dorothy studied Shiori for a moment then asked, &quot;Do you still want to
duel her?&quot;

Shiori seemed to unconsciously reach up to her cheek, caressing the
scar there with long, delicate fingers. &quot;Oh yes,&quot; she hissed as her
eyes suddenly flashed with anger, &quot;she&#39;ll pay for leaving me to die!&quot;
Almost as soon as it appeared the rage was gone as she dreamily
purred, &quot;Oh Juri my love... I&#39;ve missed you.&quot;
&quot;And we will bring you two together,&quot; Dorothy promised, &quot;when the time
is right.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Shiori breathed out, reaching out to take Dorothy&#39;s hand.
Drawing it to her mouth she kissed the top gently the her tongue
flicked out, wetly sliding between the digits in a disturbingly erotic
way.

&quot;God,&quot; Helen murmured, turning away with a blush.

&quot;Rest, Shiori,&quot; Dorothy pulled free from her gently before saying to
her, &quot;we&#39;ll be back once you&#39;re ready.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll look forward to it,&quot; Shiori purred.

Dorothy waited until they were away from the room and walking down the
hall before she said, &quot;Shiori will need to be closely watched in the
field.&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Helen agreed tentatively, more than a little disturbed by
the young woman that they were leaving. Quietly she asked Dorothy,
&quot;Ma&#39;am, are we still planning to put her in the pilot seat of a
modified Tallgeese?&quot;

&quot;We need additional pilots for the Tallgeese wing,&quot; Dorothy shrugged,
&quot;especially with all our recent losses.&quot;

Recent losses was an serious understatement, in truth OZ&#39;s Tallgeese
Wing was all but dead. First Zechs had left to attend to family duties
as Miliardo Peacecraft, then Noin and Sally had been captured in a
space battle and finally they had been forced to remove Une from her
mobile suit due to her loyalty to the former commander Treize.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Helen agreed. She checked her notes, &quot;Sadly our attempts
to recruit new pilots connected to the Gundam pilots hasn&#39;t been
successful.&quot;
&quot;Put more pressure on Ms. Winner,&quot; Dorothy said after a moment,
&quot;remind her we can kill her family and business with a word. Have you
looked into the orphanage Duo Maxwell claims as a place of birth?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve compiled a list of residents the same age as he would have
been, but so far there&#39;s no luck finding them,&quot; Helen said briskly.
&quot;Trowa Barton is clearly an alias, so no luck there, and Wu-fei&#39;s
family and associates died with his colony.&quot;

&quot;Wonder if the pilots were chosen deliberately for their lack of
connections?&quot; Dorothy murmured admiringly.

&quot;Possibly,&quot; Helen said.

&quot;And the Gemini suits?&quot; Dorothy asked.

&quot;The Gundam scientists have hammered out a prototype,&quot; Helen checked
over her notes as she said, &quot;it&#39;s a improvement over Leos by several
generations, but individually they&#39;re still not a match for a real
Gundam.&quot;

Dorothy waved that off, &quot;Doesn&#39;t matter, they won&#39;t be going up
against the Gundams one on one anyway.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s one new problem, ma&#39;am,&quot; Helen said after a moment.

&quot;Just one?&quot; Dorothy raised a eyebrow, &quot;Let&#39;s hear it.&quot;

&quot;Lady Une has dropped out of sight,&quot; Helen said tentatively, &quot;our
agents can&#39;t seem to find her anywhere.&quot;

In another part of the world a figure walked along the hall, the black
flightsuit clinging to her body. &quot;Thank you, Mr. Treize,&quot; Une said,
brown hair flowing over her shoulders.

Treize Khushrenada nodded in welcome, the two falling into step as
they went into the hanger. &quot;No, thank you,&quot; he said, &quot;your loyalty has
been one of the few things I could count on.&quot;

Une blushed faintly, looking away from him before gazing at the dark
shape crouched in the room. It was red and black, looking very much
like a knight in armor with a pair of steel wings stretching out from
the back.

&quot;This is Epyon,&quot; Treize said quietly, &quot;my gift to you, Une.&quot;

&quot;OZ&#39;s own Gundam,&quot; Une ran a hand over one leg caressingly.

&quot;It uses a new control interface called the Zero System,&quot; Treize
continued, &quot;it will enhance your fighting capabilities immeasurably.&quot;

Une took her hand away from the cool metal as she smiled grimly, &quot;And
I know exactly who I&#39;ll use it against, too.&quot;

&quot;Dorothy or Juri?&quot; Treize asked.

Une looked up at the suit, her thoughts seemingly consumed by all the
possibilities that it represented. &quot;Both of them, maybe,&quot; she finally
answered, &quot;in time.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Treize nodded. He studied her thoughtfully, &quot;Do you
understand the role I need you to play?&quot;

&quot;The bringer of chaos,&quot; Une answered him promptly, &quot;driving both sides
of this conflict closer to the final battle, and pushing them both to
deadly escalation.&quot; She flashed him a smile, &quot;It will be glorious, sir.&quot;

Treize watched her grab the cable and rise to the open cockpit, his
face revealing none of his thoughts, the pain that he hid away so
well. Only the most disciplined of minds could safely use the Zero
System, OZ scientist&#39;s experiments showed that a standard pilot would
go mad in a short time. He knew that Lady Une, as good as she was,
wouldn&#39;t last very long under the system&#39;s influence and quietly he
grieved for her.

Une stepped on the open chest plate then turned, throwing Treize a
grave salute. &quot;Good-bye sir,&quot; she said and was gone into the darkness.

&quot;Good-bye,&quot; Treize nodded.

Silently the hatch closed, the suit sitting still a moment. Then the
eyes flared red, glowing in the darkness, and Epyon straightened out,
standing noble in the dim chamber. The outer doors opened and it moved
off, stepping out onto the runway then throwing itself into the air.
Components shifted, body twisting, then something very like a dragon
soared off into the night.</pre>
