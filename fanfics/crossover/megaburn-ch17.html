<a href="../crossover/megaburn-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>&quot;Oh hell,&quot; Mackie hit the deck, the brown haired young
man ducking as explosions lit up the night. Lisa
Valente followed him to the ground, having already
learned how good his survival instincts were. In a
moment a group of Boomers shambled by them, pale
misshapen bodies warping and shifting as they moved,
but in moments they were gone.

&quot;I&#39;d love to know hnow you do that,&quot; Lisa muttered,
the dark skinned girl pushing sweaty hair up out of
her eyes.

&quot;Call it a gift,&quot; Mackie muttered as they hurried
along the wrecked back alleys of the city. Megatokyo
had already suffered under the mercenaries, and the
Boomer attack was making things even worse. The
destroyed without any rhyme or reason, killing and
maiming wildly as they sought to overrun the city.

Lisa touched her earpiece, listening to radio chatter
from her fellow officers. &quot;The mercenaries are making
a dent with the attacking Boomers, they and the AD
police may be able to get this under control,&quot; she
reported.

&quot;That still leaves the plotters who started this,&quot;
Mackie said grimly as they hurried from cover to
cover, &quot;and Nergal&#39;s private armed forces, too. We
need to get them or anything else we do will just be
meaningless.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Lisa agreed flatly, bringing up her pistol
to fire at a lone Boomer. With surprising accuracy she
punched several bullets through it&#39;s head, white blood
splattering, then it dropped, still twitching faintly.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Mackie smiled, &quot;we&#39;re even now.&quot; He looked
around, trying to get his bearings then they both
jerked at a explosion off in the distance.

&quot;What the...?&quot; Lisa had her pistol ready.

&quot;Let&#39;s take a look,&quot; Mackie waved for her to put her
gun away as they hurried forward. They peered around
the corner of a building.. only to freeze in awe.

The Boomers were powerful, but the three women tearing
into them were even more so. Minagi ad Arisugawa Juri
tore into the enemy with energy swords, cutting them
easily while Cyber Six fought with intensity and
supreme strength, tearing them apart. Along with them
Mahoro was perched on a roof top, her pistol roaring
to splatter Boomers with frightening ease.

&quot;I want a gun like that,&quot; Lisa breathed.

&quot;You&#39;d probably wreck your arms just trying to fire
it,&quot; Mackie answered dryly. Once the battle was over
he boldly stepped out, waving a hand as he yelled,
&quot;Juri!&quot;

&quot;Mackie Stingray?&quot; Juri looked surprised to see him,
her orange hair flowing back in a braid. She
extinguished the sword she carried as she walked over,
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;The boomer attack is just a distraction,&quot; Lisa
blurted.

Mackie nodded as he quickly sketched in what he had
learned. &quot;If we don&#39;t stop the ringleaders,&quot; he
finished, &quot;all of our fighting will be for nothing.&quot;

&quot;Problem is there are still a lot of mad Boomers on
the loose,&quot; Mahoro noted as the black haired android
reloaded her pistol, her maid&#39;s outfit fluttering in
the breeze.

&quot;She&#39;s right, Mackie, there&#39;s a lot of lives at risk
here,&quot; Juri said grimly. Before he could try to
protest she said, &quot;Minagi, Makoro, I want you two to
go with Mackie, we&#39;ll hold things here.&quot;

&quot;You sure boss?&quot; Minagi asked, the blue haired space
pirate looking at Juri worriedly.

&quot;It makes sense,&quot; Cyber Six removed her hat to push
her spiky black hair back, &quot;you two can fly and get
Mackie wherever he needs to go fast.&quot; The black
leather clad warrior smiled grimly, &quot;Besides, I can
always call Data Seven for back up if needed.&quot;

&quot;Ready?&quot; Mahoro asked Mackie calmly, the slim black
haired woman reaching out to carry him.

&quot;Always,&quot; Mackie nodded then looked towards Lisa. &quot;I
think you can head back to the AD Police, we should be
all right.&quot;

&quot;Oh no, I&#39;m coming along,&quot; Lisa said firmly.

&quot;But...&quot; Mackie started.

&quot;If something happens to you Nene will have my hide,&quot;
Lisa pointed out, &quot;I&#39;d better go along, if only to
save myself.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s got a point,&quot; Minagi smirked, &quot;Nene can be
fierce.&quot;

Mackie opened his mouth to continue arguing, but
finally closed it. Lisa was clearly determined, and
more importantly he might need the help. &quot;Okay,&quot; he
nodded, &quot;let&#39;s go.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Juri called.

Mahoro grabbed Mackie while Minagi grabbed Lisa then
the four were gone, disappeasring into the fire and
smioke of the wrecked city. Cyber Six turned to Juri,
the woman almost shadow like in the dim light, &quot;So,
what&#39;s the plan?&quot;

Calmly Juri ignited her sword, the orange energy blade
shimmering in the smoke. &quot;We kill Boomers,&quot; she said
as they heard the incoherent moans of the rampaging
creatures coming closer, &quot;then we&#39;ll hook up with the
other teams.&quot;

&quot;Like Setsuna&#39;s team?&quot; Cyber Six teased as she scanned
the darkness warily.

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Juri half smiled as the first
Boomers appeared. Cyber Six charged first, tearing a
boomer apart with her bare hands, then Juri followed
in, sword a blur as she cut them down with ruthless
efficiency.

Meanwhile at the Locket Tendo Nabiki sat at one of the
tables, a modified AD Police radio sitting in front of
her and a map of the city spread out on the table. Her
black hair was sprinkled with grey and her body had
lost it&#39;s vigor but her eyes were as sharp as ever.
&quot;AD Police in district twelve are hard pressed,&quot; she
relayed the message, &quot;Saber One, can you reinforce?&quot;

Priss&#39; Asagiri&#39;s voice sounded amused as she answered,
&quot;Tell them we&#39;ll be there in a minute.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Nabiki grinned.

Sasami walked up in her adult form, carrying a tray
with tea and snacks. &quot;How&#39;s it going?&quot; she asked
softly, the woman&#39;s blue hair flowing in twin streams.

&quot;Were making progress,&quot; Nabiki gestured to the map.
Red pins covered two thirds, signs of Boomer activity,
while a third was marked with blue, indicating no
Boomer activity reported.

&quot;That many Boomers loose...&quot; Sasami murmured, looking
at the red covering much of the map. She looked at
Nabiki, &quot;Is everyone all right so far?&quot;

&quot;I think so,&quot; Nabiki looked towards a shadowed corner,
&quot;physically at least.&quot;

May had appeared at the bar a few hours ago after
finishing making the arrangements for Keiko, and with
a quiet dignity had retreated to a corner with her
grief. Most of the staff had done to offer their
condolences, along with the few patrons who had come
despite the crisis, but she remained silent, drinking
steadily.

&quot;I thought May couldn&#39;t get drunk?&quot; Sasami asked
softly.

Nabiki shrugged grimly, &quot;I think she&#39;s determined to
test that theory.&quot;

Over by the front door Excel and Hyatt stood watch,
both carrying dangerous looking swords with them. Not
far away a relative newcomer to the bar waited, her
red leathers clinging to her body. &quot;Are you expecting
the Boomers to hit here?&quot; Naomi Armitage asked,
looking at Excel over the top of her sunglasses.

&quot;Not expecting,&quot; Excel said calmly, &quot;but if they do
come I want to be prepared.&quot;

&quot;Arisugawa-sama asked us to guard this bar,&quot; Hyatt
added, leaning bonelessly in the doorway, &quot;and we&#39;re
going to do so.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m surprised Genom and some of the other corps
aren&#39;t moving to help the cops,&quot; Armitage frowned,
checking a gun hidden beneath her red jacket.

&quot;Their forces are devoted to trying to protect their
staff and facilities from the Boomers,&quot; Sasami said as
she carried over a try full of cups of coffee to the
waiting group, &quot;they don&#39;t have anything left to help
with.&quot;

&quot;I just hope we get some help soon,&quot; Armitage sighed.

&quot;But I thought we were making progress against them?&quot;
Excel blurted, waving her sword around to make the
point.

&quot;Looking at the reports there&#39;s not enough Boomers
being sighted,&quot; Armitage said grimly, &quot;I just wonder
where the rest are?&quot;</pre>
