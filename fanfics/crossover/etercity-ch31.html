<a href="../crossover/etercity-ch30.html">Back to Part 30</a><pre>&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Erica Tenoh said softly as the black
haired woman walked her companion over to the table in
the high class restaurant, then holding her chair for
her. Dressed in a tuxedo she looked sleekly gorgeous,
fitting their rich surroundings perfectly.

&quot;For what?&quot; Catrine asked curiously, the blue haired
girl smiling gratefully as Erica gently pushed the
seat in place. The young woman wore a nice dress, gems
glittering at her ears and a simple pendant dangling
around her neck.

&quot;That you had to go to the trouble of asking me out,&quot;
Erica took her seat as she conceded, &quot;I guess I&#39;m a
little slow.&quot;

Catrine reached across to put a hand over Erica&#39;s.
&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; she smiled gently, &quot;I like that...
innocence you have.&quot;

Erica blushed faintly, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;It suits you,&quot; Catrine added quietly. &quot;You&#39;ve been a
bit down lately,&quot; she smiled faintly, &quot;have you heard
from Ran yet?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s back in the Khanite Territory again,&quot; Erica
said but she brightened a bit, &quot;Ran&#39;s been talking
about coming home, though.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Catrine asked, glad to see Erica brighten
again.

&quot;I think Ran was a little surprised at how happy she
was here,&quot; Erica conceded.

Just then one of the servers arrived, a tall, black
haired young man. &quot;Welcome to the rose,&quot; he smiled,
&quot;my name is Saotome, and I&#39;ll be your server tonight.&quot;

Catrine blinked, recognizing the name as she asked,
&quot;As in, the Saotome school of Anything Goes Martial
Arts?&quot;

&quot;Guilty,&quot; he grinned, &quot;the name&#39;s Duo, by the way.&quot;
Getting back to business he asked, &quot;Have you decided
on your order?&quot;

Erica grinned, &quot;How about the Valentine&#39;s day
special?&quot; She looked at Catrine warmly, &quot;Especially
since my friend here finally opened my eyes.&quot;

Catrine blushed in pleasure at that.

Across the city in one of the many crystal towers that
the city was named for a very nervous looking young
woman stood in the hallway and fretted. Nadesico
Kinimoto was attractive, her red hair falling into her
eyes as she hesitated in front of the door, raising
her hand to knock then lowering it again. Dressed in a
formal woman&#39;s suit she still managed to look faintly
cute, especially with her shining blue eyes/

Suddenly the door opened and a taller, black haired
woman looked out curiously. &quot;It&#39;s you,&quot; Jun Fudoh
blinked, &quot;what are you doing here, Nadesico?&quot;

&quot;Fudoh-san,&quot; Nadesico smiled a little sheepishly, &quot;I&#39;m
sorry to bother you. I tried to call you a few days
ago, but no one answered.&quot;

&#39;Probably because of my unscheduled visit to the
planetoid Xena,&#39; Jun thought, remembering a little
guiltily how good it had felt, unleashing her fury
like that. &quot;Something unexpected came up,&quot; she said
truthfully, &quot;and I had to go out of town.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Nadesico pushed back her hair as she
quietly confessed, &quot;I was worried you had decided to
return to seclusion, Fudoh-san.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Jun, remember?&quot; she smiled down wryly, her eyes
strangely haunted. At times like this she was reminded
faintly of Kasumi, especially in Nadesico&#39;s good
naturedness, and she knew that influenced her a bit.

&quot;Jun,&quot; Nadesico agreed, a faint blush coloring her
cheeks.

&quot;So what did you want to call me about?&quot; Jun asked as
she stepped aside, waving the younger woman into her
suite. The entrance way led into the living room,
furnished with simple designs that probably had come
with the place. The window looked out over the jumbled
core of the city, buildings of many eras stretching
out in all directions.

&quot;A bit of business,&quot; Nadesico said a bit
apologetically as she took a seat by a small side
table, &quot;as you know, your old agency has been handling
requests to use older images of you.&quot; She got some
papers from her case, &quot;With your return to the city, I
was wondering if you wanted to take a more active role
in handling that?&quot;

Jun settled into a chair with a frown, her black dress
hugging her thin form. Her body was athletic, bearing
within it a restrained, almost animalistic power,
though she seemed largely unaware of it. &quot;In what
way?&quot; she asked flatly, her shoulders visibly tense.

Nadesico felt as flash of regret at causing this
strong woman any distress, but she had a
responsibility. &quot;Normally I would simply examine the
proposed campaign then decide if it was appropriate,&quot;
she said gently, &quot;but if you like, I could bring them
to you first.&quot;

&quot;No, thank you,&quot; Jun said firmly, &quot;I&#39;m troubled enough
by my photos still being used, much less having to
deal with it on a day by day basis.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m truly sorry about that,&quot; Nadesico said faintly,
looking away from Jun&#39;s gaze.

&quot;It&#39;s not your fault,&quot; Jun sighed, running a hand
through her hair. A part of the modeling contract she
had signed with her agency all those years ago had
given the company the right to use files of her
images, in addition to her modeling. During her long
period of seclusion following the Beast Progress they
had continued to sell product with her face and
photos, building up a fame that she didn&#39;t
particularly want.

&quot;So,&quot; Nadesico asked, trying to break the
uncomfortable silence, &quot;what are you doing this
Valentine&#39;s day?&quot;

&quot;Staying at home and trying to distract myself with
bad movies,&quot; Jun answered her wryly. If there was a
holiday she was beginning to dislike it was this, with
the relentless push towards romance the whole city
seemed to have.

&quot;Single too?&quot; Nadesico asked with a faint smile

Jun blinked, looking at Nadesico closely on hearing
the faint hint of pain in her voice. Old, long unused
instincts for human interaction rustily surfaced as
she awkwardly asked, &quot;Did you have a break up?&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Nadesico nodded, looking down at her paperwork.
Oddly, she looked much younger like that, not at all
like the confident twenty-something she was. &quot;We were
fighting a lot anyway, but...&quot; she shrugged.

With a odd sort of reluctance Jun patted her hand,
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Nadesico smiled faintly, &quot;Thanks.&quot; She looked at Jun
thoughtfully, &quot;And you?&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t dated in...&quot; Jun hesitate, unsure how the
girl would take a truthful reply, then settled for, &quot;a
long time.&quot; Silently she added, &#39;Centuries, in fact.&#39;

&quot;It sounds rough,&quot; Nadesico said softly, looking at
her with a disturbing degree of compassion.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Jun said softly. Seeing Nadesico&#39;s faint
confusion she shrugged slightly, &quot;I knew true love
once, and nothing else can compare.&quot; Jun smiled as she
added, &quot;You have an alarming gift to inspire me to
making confidences.&quot;

&quot;Maybe some part of you has just decided it&#39;s time to
open up?&quot; Nadesico offered, though she looked secretly
pleased by the suggestion.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Jun conceded.

Nadesico heard a soft beep and looked at the cuff of
her suit and the digital readout of a clock there. &quot;Oh
no,&quot; she groaned, &quot;I forgot.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t look pleased,&quot; Jun noted as Nadesico
quickly picked up her paperwork, a little frown on her
face.

&quot;It&#39;s a reminded for a singles party I need to go to,&quot;
Nadesico admitted, &quot;my friends threatened to drag me
out of the house to keep me from moping over the
breakup.&quot;

&quot;And you don&#39;t want to go,&quot; Jun noted.

&quot;I&#39;m going to a ball full of people I don&#39;t know, in
theory to try to create some kind of romantic
connection,&quot; Nadesico sighed, &quot;when I&#39;d rather mope,
to be honest.&quot;

&quot;I can relate,&quot; Jun murmured, fighting a sudden, mad
impulse. With a sigh of defeat she said, &quot;Would it
help if you had someone come with you?&quot;

Nadesico looked at her in surprise, &quot;You&#39;re offering?&quot;
When Jun nodded firmly Nadesico broke into a smile,
&quot;Thank you.&quot;

To be continued....

Notes: I figured Erica would never actually notice
that Catrine was interested in her, so Catrine had to
take the first step. For Ran fans don&#39;t worry, she&#39;ll
be back soon. I&#39;m also continuing the Jun arc here, as
well as fleshing out young Nadesico.</pre>
