&quot;Sometimes I think defeating Searrs would be a whole lot easier if 
someone would just bring me enough metal to construct a loyal army of 
robots.&quot; - Radulf Sayers, 2046.

- - -

For countless years, the sacred city of Kyoto had been warred over 
systematically and routinely. Everything had been very simple at the 
core of the conflict. It was the Otome facing against the HiME, and that 
had been it. When one advanced, the other counterattacked. There was no 
outside opposition. For however bloody the war had been, there were 
several constants that those in power had taken for granted. Now, the 
well oiled war machines broke down and lost their direction. People who 
had been used to taking city block after city block were now forced to 
deal with something unprecedented in their generation. This was massive 
destruction.

Kyoto was now in absolute chaos. The presence of three thousand Orphans 
signaled a halt in the great war between the long time rivals. That did 
not mean there was cooperation. No, each side let the other fend for 
themselves. The swarm had come on so quickly that it was difficult to 
give orders. While the monsters were the obvious new threat, there were 
still other options to consider. The Emulator&#39;s strange behavior, the 
Global Materialization System... and all of it had gone hand in hand 
almost like a well thought out plan!

It was a new game.

The Kyoto Emulator, the eldest in all the worlds, stated that it would 
only reopen if it was given eleven keys. What had that meant? What keys? 
Why had the Emulator summoned such a great mass of monsters that 
attacked both factions? It made little sense, but it was obviously all 
linked together somehow. In just a short period of time, Natsuki Kruger 
was forced to deal not only with that, but with the incoming Ikusahime 
as well.

It was all chaos, and yet she remained disturbingly calm. Even the most 
logical and reserved meisters, Ann and the rest, had felt overwhelmed. 
In an odd way, Natsuki felt as if she preferred this chaos to the 
straightforward war against the HiME. Countless possibilities were made 
available to her now. She didn&#39;t have to concentrate on incessantly 
rebuffing HiME Heir attacks. It was a wonderful time, was it not?

Her body visibly shivered a moment in rebellion, though her mind did not 
notice the movement at all. With all Otome depending on her sage wisdom, 
she gave her orders. It was time to put her status as the highest 
scoring tactical graduate of her year to good use. She had been 
conditioned to lead and command. If a new game was being played, then 
she would gladly participate with a smile in her heart.

&quot;Ann,&quot; she began, &quot;I want you to take the Dammerung Y-types to the 
northern side of the palace and put up a defensive line a good distance 
out. Haruka, you take our Otome and do the same for the south side.&quot;

&quot;As you wish, Headmistress,&quot; Ann said with a curt bow. Haruka grinned 
wildly and pumped a fist into the air. She finally had a chance to rip 
these monsters some new assholes!

&quot;I have a special project for some of you, however. Mai and the other 
traitors still need to be apprehended and disarmed before they can pose 
an additional threat. While the rest defend Garderobe from the monsters, 
I want you people to help bring them down.&quot; Natsuki&#39;s eyes, devoid of a 
certain spark that had been there before, darted to a few faces.

&quot;Akane.&quot; The young ex-Trias member looked a bit surprised at the 
appointment, but nodded briskly.

&quot;Yukariko.&quot; Always one to rise to the call of duty, Miss Steinburg gave 
her a humble bow.

&quot;Shiho.&quot; No one had expected that. The black robed meister seemed eager 
to fight, regardless.

&quot;Akira.&quot; The sullen Zipang native pushed herself off of the wall she&#39;d 
been leaning on. How odd a request.

Her orders given, everyone broke into their respective teams. Natsuki, 
clad in her robe, stepped down from the commander&#39;s chair to join her 
special little task force. Before she could fall into line with them, 
however, Ann stopped and grabbed hold of her arm. Natsuki was forced to 
spin around and face the elder meister, who seemed mildly concerned at 
the headmistress&#39; idea of strategy. &quot;Forgive me, Natsuki, but why have 
you selected those people for such a dangerous task? Shiho and Akane are 
inexperienced and Miss Okuzaki is a diplomat. She shouldn&#39;t be fighting 
at all.&quot;

&quot;Stop questioning me, Ann, it&#39;s becoming an annoyance. I know what I&#39;m 
doing,&quot; Natsuki hissed, ripping her arm free of the other woman&#39;s grip.

&quot;Respect your elder, you impertinent child,&quot; Ann snapped back. &quot;I am the 
senpai of the one who taught you how to fight. You should not take such 
a tone with me.&quot;

&quot;Given how she assaulted Windbloom Castle and tried to kill several of 
her former allies, I can see just how good a teacher you are, Princess.&quot; 
Natsuki smirked somewhat sadistically and turned on her heel, leaving 
Ann to fume silently. Seniority ignored, Ann was still subject to 
Natsuki&#39;s command, no matter how irritating in recent days. &quot;Go to post 
and contact me when you have something productive to say.&quot;

Natsuki led her new group, the four flanking her on either side, out 
into the city. The roaring of beasts invaded what would have been a 
fairly quiet night. It was haunting, but also majestic. It was in the 
city that Natsuki would lay a trap for her beloved. The Dammerung 
archives said that the Ikusahime could be defeating in one of three 
ways. The first was to kill the HiME. Given how skilled they were at 
combat, that simple approach was also a difficult one. The second was to 
kill their most precious person, the one they relied on for power. She 
could not hunt them all down. The final option? To kill the Child. While 
she did not want to kill the Children outright, as something in her told 
her that that action would harbor bad results, she sought only to 
capture them and hold them hostage. Surely the Ikusahime would bend to 
her if that could be done.

When they&#39;d gotten outside of Dammerung&#39;s defensive perimeter, they fell 
under attack. It was an Orphan scout, hunting for blood, and it sprang 
forth from the shadows. Akane jetted out of the way with trained 
reaction time, and the beast then went for the next best target. 
Natsuki. Shouts of warning were heard from her teammates.

The monster&#39;s talons lashed out in Natsuki&#39;s direction, and the 
Headmistress held aloft her artillery in hopes of blasting it away. In 
the last moments, the beast halted. A red Searrs emblem appeared on its 
body, and it stopped to examine her. With some sense of recognition, the 
purple skinned Orphan withdrew without causing harm to the beautiful Ice 
Silver Crystal.

&quot;Are they on our side?&quot; Yukariko asked.

Akane shook her head. &quot;No, it tried to attack me just now.&quot;

Natsuki idly watched as Akira leapt up with theoretical human strength 
and sliced through the beast&#39;s neck with a surgically sharp tanto blade. 
It bled to death on the cracked and frozen streets below, groaning in 
agony. The Zipang kunoichi landed on the ground again and nodded to the 
group after eliminating the not so deadly threat. Her blade was sheathed 
once again after she&#39;d done away with the blood.

&quot;I guess they like you, Headmistress!&quot; Shiho called from the rearguard 
of the five member formation.

Something inside Natsuki smiled. Of course they did.

- - -

Kagutsuchi&#39;s fiery wings carried him over the ruined city of Kyoto, and 
his mistress merely looked down in awe and horror. Mai initially thought 
they were Slaves, as any good Otome would, but they were most definitely 
not. Her inner spirit screamed out, though she couldn&#39;t understand the 
message at first. Flashes of Takumi and Natsuki entered her mind, and 
she remembered the rite of passage undertaken at the mountain. They were 
not Slaves, oh no.

&quot;Orphans! Thousands of them!&quot; Mai exclaimed. &quot;How is this possible?&quot;

&quot;Rena was programmed to summon Slaves. Most of the Slaves in that final 
battle against Nagi came from her. Perhaps the Emulator here is the same 
way, but with Orphans,&quot; Yukino offered. &quot;It&#39;s an older Emulator, so it 
probably mimics the Obsidian Lord more closely than subsequent models.&quot;

&quot;It looks like a damn plague,&quot; Nao muttered on the other side of their 
flight.

&quot;But why?&quot; Yukino continued to ponder. &quot;Orphans were only truly featured 
in the first half of the Carnival, weren&#39;t they? They were meant to 
break us in as warriors.&quot;

Mai shrugged. &quot;Who can say? With the Obsidian Lord gone, anything goes.&quot;

Midori, for however shocked she was at the scene, found her strength. 
Ever the motivator, she held up her labrys and cheered. &quot;If this isn&#39;t a 
job for the HiME Sentai, I don&#39;t know what is! Only one thing to do &#150; go 
get &#39;em!&quot;

Their formation broke up as the Children spread through the air, each 
one heading for a specific concentration point in the beastly horde. 
Kagutsuchi dove down and inhaled, taking air into his massive turbine 
lungs. Fire was mixed in, and he released the blaze unto the helpless 
enemy. A row of Orphans was incinerated in his mighty blaze, and he 
began to pull up from the dive after his attack was complete. Mai and 
Mikoto hung on, the G-forces pushing them down and backwards. Their 
ascent, however, came to a swift and immediate halt.

There were four shrieks, and Kagutsuchi found himself snared in four 
separate grappling hooks. With the sudden change in forward momentum, 
Mai and Mikoto were flung skyward while the dragon was dragged back down 
to Earth. Mikoto screamed, but Mai swooped under her like a hero from an 
old comic, catching her in the fall. Mai&#39;s Elements allowed her to 
hover, much like her robe would have, and she turned to check on her 
Child.

The metal ropes attached to the grappling hooks were tightened rapidly, 
and he was held firm, no matter how many times he tried to flap his 
blazing wings. Mai&#39;s eyes followed the lengths of their fibers and saw 
several of her comrades below, having operated the machines that now 
held her Child hostage. She was initially filled with rage. What did 
they intend to do with Kagutsuchi? Kill him and leave her powerless 
while condemning her dear Takumi to death?

&quot;Akane-chan!&quot; Mai shouted to the leader of the group. Shiho stood to her 
left.

Akane placed her hand next to her mouth, hoping to project her voice. 
&quot;Mai, surrender at once or else we will be forced to destroy this 
monster!&quot;

She opened her mouth to answer, but heard another roar in the near 
distance. She spun around again to see Kiyohime fall from the sky, 
victim to the same trap as her own Child. Gakutenou soon followed. Diana 
and Julia climbed high into the sky to avoid the same fate, fortunately 
for their HiME. Mai bit her lower lip in worry. Damn it, now what was 
she to do?! Her eyes turned back to Akane and Shiho. They were HiME! Why 
had Natsuki ordered the other HiME to do this task?

Regardless, Mai couldn&#39;t damn well surrender with all the Orphans 
running about. Who else would stop them? The Otome were only protecting 
their structures and people. The rest would be doomed, and Mai would not 
be able to discover the truth behind it all. She tightened her fist. 
&quot;No, Akane! You listen to me! I do not take orders from you, and never 
have. As your elder, as a senior meister, and as the Queen of Heaven, I 
order you to back off and let my Child go.&quot;

The graviton rings on Akane&#39;s robe activated, glowing a dull yellow in 
the darkened area. Shiho&#39;s lit up soon after. Well, if it was war they 
wanted, they would just have to learn that cheap imitations could never 
stand up to the real thing. Shiho shouted next. &quot;You stupid woman! 
You&#39;ve sold your soul to those cultist freaks!&quot;

Mai turned to her attention to the girl dangling from her left hand. An 
order that did not need to be stated aloud. &quot;Mikoto.&quot;

The Mistress of Kagutsuchi dipped lower and the released the girl, who 
summoned up Miroku and charged forward with a fountain of sparks in her 
wake. With a mighty spin, Mikoto sent her weapon hurtling towards Shiho 
in wide arc. The young Otome summoned up a shield at the proper time and 
prevented the strike from reaching its mark. Shiho then jetted up and 
down again, hoping to land a kick. Mikoto rolled out the way and slammed 
her weapon into the ground, causing a multitude of obsidian stalagmites 
to rise from the ground. Shiho rapidly adjusted her flight path with a 
loud squeal, almost skewered by the unnatural spears.

In the air, the two former Trias leaders circled each other &#150; one 
powered by a robe and the other by her Elements. Kagutsuchi groaned 
below as Mai let loose with a large flare that cut through the sky right 
towards the other female. Akane shot up and out of the way, spinning and 
then coming back down to dive right at Mai. Knowing of the explosive 
powers the Otome had at full speed, Mai chose to avoid her all together, 
darting to the side. When Akane slowed to come about, Mai moved in.

And as they fought, the red star twinkled.

Kiyohime had been pulled out of the sky so roughly that Shizuru had 
blacked out after hitting the ground below. Her eyes flickered open a 
short time later, but everything around her was covered in a thick haze. 
She brought her head up slightly, her red eyes trying to take in her 
surroundings. There was deep roaring to the distant right &#150; Mai and 
Mikoto were in peril. To the distant left was the clashing of metal &#150; 
Midori and Miyu locked in their own battle with the enemy. There were 
large, fast moving blurs in the sky. The others?

As she focused, all of Kyoto vanished around her. The roars faded into 
nothingness. The shrieks of metal on metal fell silent. The world 
narrowed into nothing but that one single, broken street. Nothing else 
mattered. She saw the faint outline of her beloved, heading into one of 
the buildings, and Shizuru was compelled to follow. She stood on shaky 
legs and stumbled forward, into the poorly lit home, and there she felt 
her legs give out. Would Natsuki execute her in this weakened state? It 
was the most logical time to strike, although the most dishonorable.

Her vision blurred again, and her head fell back onto the asphalt ground 
below. She distinctly felt a hand brush sandy brown locks of hair out of 
her face, tenderly and lovingly. Comfort and confusion gripped Shizuru 
at the same time. Those soft fingers traced her jawline, her lips, and 
then trailed down her neck. Why had she been forgiven so easily for her 
betrayal? Had the other girl finally come to her senses?

Shizuru&#39;s heart leapt with hope at that thought. Natsuki and Duran, 
charging into battle with the rest of them in order to have her revenge 
on those who harmed sweet Alyssa. Together they would bring down that 
horrible organization who recreated something that should have faded 
away entirely. She saw Natsuki smiling, and it filled her with joy.

&quot;Shizuru...&quot;

Beautiful Natsuki. Shizuru&#39;s right hand, on its own accord, came up to 
try and touch that wondrous angel before her. Natsuki&#39;s fingers met 
hers, and the younger woman&#39;s smile widened. A light laugh was heard. 
How marvelous, indeed. Shizuru instantly fell at ease, despite however 
illogical this behavior was. Because without Natsuki, she was nothing.

&quot;Shizuru, my hime, you would do anything for me, ne?&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot; The reply was automatic. Of course she would. Yet, Natsuki&#39;s 
voice was somewhat different. Why?

&quot;Kyoto and this new Earth disgust me. Everything here is monotonous 
fighting, with no grace or beauty in the battles. This incessant warring 
between the Otome and the HiME is pathetic and redundant. Wouldn&#39;t you 
like to see it done away with?&quot; Shizuru nodded absently. &quot;Then help me 
make the world new again, Shizuru.&quot;

She opened her mouth to agree, but something within prevented the words 
from leaving. As her vision sharpened, so did her wits. This wasn&#39;t 
right, was it? Natsuki was speaking in fluent Japanese. Old Japanese, 
from their previous time, not the Zipang dialect or the distinct dialect 
now found amongst the current Nihon natives. It was a sign, wasn&#39;t it? 
Natsuki was an Ikusahime again, just like her. That was surely the only 
explanation. But she was never the less hesitant, given the girl&#39;s odd 
behavior.

Natsuki sensed this, and moved forward, climbing atop Shizuru and 
lowering herself down to the point where their lips almost touched. 
Shizuru felt the curves of her lover&#39;s body pressing down on her, and it 
was then she realized just how much it felt like she hadn&#39;t seen her in 
years, thanks to all the chaos. So very tempting. Like a serpent 
offering her forbidden fruit. Natsuki nearly kissed her, but held back 
at the last moment.

&quot;We&#39;re a perfect match, you and I. We&#39;re destined for each other. I was 
so blind not to see it before, Shizuru. Our souls depend on one another 
for survival, don&#39;t they?&quot;

Is she referring to the HiME-Key relationship?!

A hand ran up her thigh, and she trembled. She feared it. Something was 
very wrong. Natsuki would never act like this so randomly, especially 
not in the middle of a battlefield. She could faintly hear Kiyohime 
wailing outside. Natsuki&#39;s voice became low, demanding her attention. 
&quot;Shizuru, my hime, I need you. None of the others can possibly compare 
with your splendor.&quot;

&quot;Natsuki...&quot;

A feather soft kiss graced Shizuru&#39;s neck, and she froze. Not right. Not 
familiar. Something was off. Hands continued to roam in places where 
they had certainly touched before, but it was not the same. Natsuki 
moaned. &quot;Normally, I would say that claiming someone&#39;s body would not 
make them mine, but you have always submitted quite willingly to such 
things, ne? Shizuru... make love to me.&quot;

Natsuki leaned forward again, her dark hair cascading around the both of 
them. She smirked and moved to kiss Shizuru, who darted her eyes up to 
properly look at Natsuki just before. Within Natsuki&#39;s green orbs were 
strands of yellow and gold. Yellow eyes. With one swift movement, 
Shizuru flung Natsuki off of her body. The headmistress flew back as 
Shizuru scrambled to her feet. The Krov bardiche was out in a second, 
pointing right at the other woman&#39;s heart.

Despite the sudden attack, Natsuki calmly got to her feet and strolled 
over to a plush but dusty couch that rested in the middle of the room 
they were in. She lay back, draping herself across it like a cat, her 
blue trench coat rustling as she settled. She was not using her robe. 
How odd, indeed. A leather clad leg was slightly brought up. Gone was 
the prudish officer, replaced by what appeared to be a seductress.

&quot;So aggressive,&quot; Natsuki commented with a smile. &quot;That was what I always 
liked about you. You&#39;re so predictable in your unpredictability. Throw a 
little bit of emotional distress your way, and you lash out like a tiger 
hit with a branding iron. It&#39;s a wonderfully useful reaction.&quot;

Mai. Reito. The Obsidian Lord always strategically chose a host that 
could seduce the HiME most likely to win the Carnival. But Mai also had 
Tate, which ruined that tactic. Yellow eyes. This was not right. Shizuru 
snarled. &quot;You aren&#39;t real. The Emulator is just a digital copy of the 
Obsidian Lord and it&#39;s core. This shouldn&#39;t be possible.&quot;

&quot;But it is.&quot; Natsuki sat up, that smirk still present on her face. &quot;The 
true body may be deceased, but it alone was still a machine. Humans are 
so amusing, aren&#39;t they? They are nearly wiped out entirely by a weapon 
they have no idea how to use, and then they make a copy of it for their 
own purposes for the sake of power. Always to backfire. Always to 
betray. When they made an exact copy of the Obsidian Lord via the 
original Emulators, well, what would they expect to happen when all 
puzzle pieces came back together?&quot;

&quot;Give her to me!&quot; Shizuru shouted.

&quot;I just tried,&quot; came the laconic reply.

&quot;So what? You want another Carnival held in your honor? Only a few of us 
have our powers. The rest are clueless to their past. It&#39;s not going to 
work.&quot;

&quot;For now. They&#39;re fighting with the others as we speak. Can you not hear 
the roars of Gakutenou and Kagutsuchi? Everything will come back to them 
in time,&quot; Natsuki said. &quot;And if necessary, I will force them to 
remember. Do not worry, my depraved maiden, I am an expert at moving 
power figures around like pawns. I&#39;ve been doing for thousands of 
years.&quot;

&quot;If you want me to be the last one standing, I won&#39;t fall into that trap 
again.&quot; A promise. A hopeful one, anyway.

Natsuki stood and came a few paces closer, her chest pressing softly 
against the tip of Shizuru&#39;s bardiche. She grabbed hold of the weapon 
and moved it to the side without resistance, coming closer still. 
Natsuki ran her fingers down the side of Shizuru&#39;s face. &quot;Oh, but you 
must. Because if you don&#39;t defeat all the others, this body will perish 
with you. You&#39;ll steal her life away, and she won&#39;t even know it. You&#39;ll 
have murdered your beloved because of your rebellion.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; Shizuru nearly wept. &quot;You don&#39;t have any leverage this time. 
There is no HiME Star to come crashing down to Earth.&quot;

&quot;Oh, really?&quot; The other figure laughed. &quot;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re wrong, my 
love. There&#39;s a Star forged by man on an impact course for Earth, though 
few have seen it. Your new world&#39;s Otome Star was originally designed to 
be a replacement for the one you destroyed. It was planned even before 
the Last Carnival began. Its purpose had just been altered. But I have 
made it mine again. And I will use it to force you to fight.&quot;

&quot;Then we&#39;ll just destroy it again,&quot; Shizuru stated.

&quot;You will try,&quot; Natsuki agreed. &quot;But you will find that time is not on 
your side and the situation itself is unfavorable. If you want to ensure 
the world is made again for a new era, rather than destroyed outright, 
you must be the last one standing.&quot;

No, she would not play this game again! She had done it once and had 
learned from it. The only reason the Last Carnival had gotten out of 
hand was a mess of misunderstandings and elevated emotions. Would that 
air of insanity descend upon them all again just because the cycle had 
technically been reactivated? Perhaps not dwelling on that would be for 
the best. It was all just an artificial Carnival, anyway. A fake. It 
could never be more than that, could it? Fake at its very core.

&quot;I refuse you. All I have to do is destroy the Emulator and the Star, 
and then you will be sent back to the hell you deserve to be in,&quot; 
Shizuru spoke. &quot;The others will be there to help me this time. You don&#39;t 
have the same element of surprise as you did last time.&quot;

&quot;If you knew!&quot; Natsuki laughed. If Shizuru knew what? Natsuki then 
pointed to herself, and the laughter grew even louder. &quot;If she knew!&quot;

Shizuru chose that moment to strike. She could not kill Natsuki, of 
course, but she could still render her unconscious. The sooner Natsuki&#39;s 
body was sedated and stored somewhere, the better. The last thing anyone 
needed if the Carnival was restarting was to have the Obsidian Lord free 
to walk around as he... she pleased. She lunged forward, bardiche 
twisting up toward her face.

Natsuki ducked out of the way, looking mildly appalled by the action. 
Her gazed darkened and she held her arm out, a thin weapon materializing 
from gathering photons. It was not her artillery. It was not her HiME 
Element. It was, rather, the same katana used by Reito during the final 
battle of the previous Carnival. The blade was sharper than any other. 
The guard was the same as Miroku&#39;s. The sheath was a fine obsidian. 
Natsuki held it out and summoned her robe for additional power.

&quot;Such a rebellious destined wife,&quot; Natsuki taunted. &quot;You will see in 
time that I am your only savior, Shizuru-san. I am the only one who can 
help you in the miserable situation you don&#39;t even know you&#39;re in. It is 
unwise to make me an enemy!&quot;

&quot;Tricks and lies, those are the only things you excel at,&quot; Shizuru shot 
back.

The possessed Natsuki smirked again. Ah, how she wished to let it all 
out right now! But she could not, because that would ruin the emotional 
impact, and that was so very vital. She was now feeding directly from 
the sorrow and emotions of the Ikusahime, as had been done for thousands 
upon thousands of years. Such a bittersweet taste it had. Absolutely 
beautiful.

Her grip on the katana tightened. &quot;If you wish to temporarily pursue 
this act of defiance, I can only allow it to you. Sometimes youth must 
find themselves in hardship before they are ready to see the truth. I am 
a very patient being, my hime.&quot;

I can stop the Obsidian Lord now! Shizuru thought. I just have to be 
quick about it!

Her bardiche swung out in a wide arch, and it was met with that sharp 
and ancient katana. Despite Natsuki having never mastered the art of 
bladed weapons, as she had always concentrated on firearm use and 
martial arts, she used it remarkably well. Then again, it was someone 
else in control. Natsuki brought the blade down, and Shizuru was forced 
to block it with the shaft of her own Element. Sparks flew at the 
contact. The senpai spun and came back around with the blade, but 
Natsuki jumped back. Perfect. Shizuru was still in range, while 
Natsuki&#39;s shorter blade became ineffective. That was just what she 
wanted. Jamming her thumb on a small, nigh invisible, button, she 
activated the chain portion of her Element.

The blade segmented and stretched, and she whipped it forward. Natsuki 
ducked, and the south wall of the house was taken out entirely. The 
structure began to shake, already battered from ages of war, and the 
pair bolted out before it tumbled. As the roof collapsed, they made it 
into the street, where Kiyohime was still bound. All of her heads roared 
in anger as she saw the fight, but was otherwise unable to help. A Child 
could not face the Obsidian Lord until the Star was gone.

Robe enhanced, Natsuki launched forward and met Shizuru&#39;s weapon with 
incredible momentum. The augmented blow threw Shizuru off balance, but 
she quickly recovered as Natsuki slowed herself down and returned to the 
ground. Shizuru used the chain whip again, leaving multiple scars in the 
street as Natsuki danced and flew around the attacks.

Natsuki went high and then dove down at great speed, her right leg 
stretched out. The kick connected with the ground, to her dismay, as 
Shizuru expertly avoided it. The asphalt below shattered upon impact. 
She then used the katana to lash out repeated, all hits blocked by the 
large blade of Shizuru&#39;s bardiche. A thrust from the katana. It was 
batted aside. A horizontal slash. Parried. A vertical strike. Evaded. 
Such a different warrior from Tokiha Mai-san. Equally strong &#150; just 
different. Wonderful. One of the best in history.

So much like a Canaanite girl who had been the Mistress of Gakutenou in 
a Carnival prior. Same spirit and professionalism.

Finding a hole in the timing, Shizuru made a downward diagonal slash 
towards her lover&#39;s body. Knowing that the katana was too slender a 
blade to properly match the full weight of a thick bardiche, Natsuki 
slid to the side using her robe. Shizuru was left momentarily weak as 
she used all her muscles to lift that weapon back up. Darting in, the 
Obsidian Lord reverted to Natsuki&#39;s wonderful martial arts skills, 
letting his host&#39;s instincts take over.

The back of Natsuki&#39;s hand slammed into her opponent&#39;s jaw, and in the 
second that followed, a knee was driven equally hard into Shizuru&#39;s gut. 
Knocked to the ground, Shizuru scrambled to get upright once again, all 
while trying to get air back into her lungs. The jaw stung horribly, but 
she didn&#39;t have time to concentrate on it. Natsuki was darting in at an 
alarmingly high rate of speed. Shizuru rolled to her back and used the 
shaft of her Element to block an incoming strike.

The Obsidian Lord&#39;s katana was right in the middle of her weapon, 
pressing down on it with Natsuki&#39;s full weight. Shizuru&#39;s arms struggled 
to keep the weapon from sinking further towards her face, and her body 
trembled involuntarily. Unable to push Natsuki back, Shizuru kicked up 
with her leg and hit Natsuki&#39;s in the stomach. That did the trick. In 
that lapse of time, Shizuru sprang up and spun around, using the whip to 
strike. The Crystal robe was able to form a shield that deflected it.

&quot;I&#39;m always so limited by the virility of the host body,&quot; Natsuki&#39;s 
voice stated. &quot;She is much better than Kanzaki Reito was at the art of 
warfare! How amusing! How excellent!&quot;

Shizuru ignored the upbeat commentary and moved in to spear her lover&#39;s 
leg. The katana came down, slicing through the air like a crescent moon, 
slamming the bardiche off course. Before Natsuki could attack, Shizuru 
tried to slam the pole end of her weapon into her. The dark haired woman 
only ducked out of the way.Anticipating an attack, Shizuru leapt out of 
range in two great bounds.

A grand flurry of rapid attacks from what should have been a very heavy 
weapon followed suit, Shizuru managing great speed with her Element. 
Natsuki had a difficult time keeping up, blocking each shot as quickly 
as they came. Three in a second! She counted them all, awed at the 
skill. She lost the tally somewhere around twenty-six. The burst of 
energy did not last long, and it left Shizuru drained. All the better 
for Natsuki, yes?

They had traversed half the length of the street in that one single 
volley of attacks. Now, Natsuki tried to push her back in the other 
direction with a combination of well timed katana strikes coupled with a 
barrage of martial arts moves. A backhand, a roundhouse, and a thrust 
from the sword. All avoided. Using the robe, she rushed forward and 
attempted to knee Shizuru again. It did not connect.

There was a brief pause in her assault, and Shizuru could have easily 
attempted to strike her down right then and there. She did not even try 
to attack. As a result, Natsuki would punish Shizuru for lack of follow 
through. In that gap of time, Natsuki flew forward and sent a powerful 
uppercut right into Shizuru&#39;s already pained jaw. A yelp. What a melodic 
sound. The katana came down and sliced into Shizuru&#39;s leg. Nothing 
vital, of course. Natsuki needed her alive. The real Natsuki nearly 
broke free and took back control at the sound of Shizuru screaming in 
pain, but the Lord quelled her mental rebellion.

Natsuki sent a well placed kicked into Shizuru&#39;s chest, which knocked 
her to the ground. Once down, Natsuki sprang and impaled the katana in 
the asphalt right beside her head. Natsuki got so close that Shizuru&#39;s 
Element was useless, and Natsuki held it down as well. That smirk was 
still on her face. A small laugh, like a parent amused by their child&#39;s 
tantrum. Natsuki planted a small kiss on Shizuru&#39;s lips. Foreign and 
wrong. Someone else.

&quot;You are much too arrogant, Shizuru-san. You most definitely 
underestimated the abilities of your kohai, and you failed to commit to 
several of your attacks because of that damned sense of attachment,&quot; 
Natsuki criticized. &quot;I won&#39;t stand for that kind of hesitance when 
you&#39;re slaying others for me &#150; for your love.&quot;

Shizuru turned her eyes away, but Natsuki let go of her katana and 
clamped her fingers around Shizuru&#39;s bruised jaw, forcing her to turn 
back.

&quot;I forgive you for this outburst. I trust it will not happen again.&quot; 
Another horrible kiss. &quot;How delicious. I hear her screaming with worry 
inside. Oh, don&#39;t snarl like that. It is a most unbecoming look for a 
maiden. Now please, be careful in this Carnival. I do not want you any 
more injured that I have just made you.&quot;

Natsuki backed off and shot into the air before Shizuru could use her 
weapon. The Kyoto woman called out after her, but it did not good. 
Natsuki left. In pain, Shizuru sat up only to clutch at her blood 
drenched leg, grunting and whimpering with every move. Her hands covered 
the cut and prevented more blood from draining out. The limb was already 
paler than normal. That was worrisome. Her leg, her jaw, her torso... 
all of it gave a tortured howl.

Damn it all, Natsuki was not supposed to be better than she was! She had 
never defeated Shizuru in a Garderobe match and had never defeated her 
in genuine combat as a HiME! This was not fair! The horribly arrogant 
side of Shizuru Viola inwardly bitched at the outcome of the fight while 
the more mellow Fujino side simply tried to mentally deal with what had 
just happened.

She stood, after several minutes, and hobbled over to where Kiyohime 
lie. Shizuru dropped down next to one the hydra&#39;s head and lay next to 
it, placing her hands on the purple metal for some sense of 
companionship. &quot;Kiyohime, are you all right?&quot;

An affirmative purr. Shizuru took her bardiche and slashed through one 
of the metal cords holding her Child down. With the release of one, the 
machine beast took over and wrestled herself free of the others. Another 
head came to rest next to Shizuru, asking her to climb atop it so that 
she could rest. The young woman obliged, falling into Kiyohime&#39;s 
protection.

Ah, but the others! What if they defeated a HiME? At that thought, 
Kiyohime took to the sky.

- - -

Kagutsuchi became airborne after Kiyohime freed him from captivity. 
Shiho and Akane rightfully froze in fear and contemplated retreat. With 
both Kiyohime and Kagutsuchi looming above, they dare not attack. The 
Mistresses of each alone could have stood as worthy opposition. Mai and 
Mikoto looked confused, but welcomed the assistance. Shizuru, on the 
other hand, simply wanted to end this before it got out of hand. Thank 
god that no one had slain each other.

&quot;This needs to stop right now. Natsuki is not herself!&quot; Shizuru warned. 
Mai and Mikoto jumped to attention, but the other two refused to 
initially believe the accusation.

Mai was the first to inquire. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;The Emulator is duplicating the Obsidian Lord&#39;s wave patterns so 
perfectly that the Carnival is restarting. Natsuki is under the control 
of this new digital Obsidian Lord.&quot;

Shizuru pointed to the sky above, and all followed. A red star was next 
to the moon, bright as any other. Why had they not noticed before? Mai&#39;s 
jaw dropped. &quot;Oh, god...&quot;

&quot;What do we do, Mai?&quot; Mikoto kept one eye on the other pair, just in 
case. It seemed as if Akane and Shiho were just as interested in the 
discussion, and they did not attack.

Mai absently scratched at her jaw. &quot;Um... well... not killing each other 
would probably be a good first move.&quot;

&quot;We have to destroy the HiME Star in order to properly combat the 
Emulator, but we can&#39;t do that without everyone&#39;s help. It&#39;s too big for 
just the small group of us. Shizuru&#39;s eyes then turned to Akane and 
Shiho. &quot;The pair of you, you must understand that Natsuki is no longer 
herself and is not to be trusted.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s it, everyone&#39;s out of their mind,&quot; Shiho ironically commented, 
and Akane nearly laughed at the statement. &quot;I give up.&quot;

&quot;Is that why the Emulators have gone so haywire? Some sentient thing has 
taken control over the machine and the network?&quot; Akane dared to be one 
of the first to actually talk to the so called traitors. All thanked her 
curiosity and sense of logic in times of crisis.

&quot;Yeah. The Obsidian Lord has Natsuki under control, just like he had 
hold of Reito,&quot; Mai answered, forgetting that neither of the Otome had 
recovered their memories. The two gave Mai a blank look, but she was too 
busy focusing on the Star to notice. Mai&#39;s eyes flashed with something, 
and she then laughed slightly. &quot;Hey, I feel cheated here! I thought I 
was the one most likely to win these things!&quot;

Shizuru looked at her for a moment, but was too angry about Natsuki&#39;s 
use as the host to reply in an equally light tone. She returned her 
attention to the Otome. Pointing her bardiche at them, she said, &quot;The 
Otome don&#39;t know how to deal with this crisis. We need you on our side 
immediately, or all will be lost. Afterwards, you can do as you like. 
But know that your place is with us. You are reborn legends, and it is 
your destiny to take up your Elements again.&quot;

&quot;Why should I believe you?&quot; Akane asked.

Mai and Shizuru tossed glances to each other, and it was the redhead who 
found the winning statement. &quot;Akane. Did you know that as a HiME, you 
can have sex with the person you&#39;re supposed to guard... and not lose 
your powers?&quot;

Bingo.

Midori ducked out of an energy arrow as Yukariko fired from a distance. 
Akira was up close and personal, and their weapons clashed repeatedly. 
Gakutenou was still tied up, and Nao had only recently dropped down to 
try and support her by fighting with Yukariko. The nun never the less 
managed to try and cover Akira at the same time. An admirable feat of 
fighting spirit, really. It would have been far easier, however, if Miyu 
had stuck around long enough to be of assistance to anyone. Curse that 
robot!

Midori hadn&#39;t even had time to try and talk sense into Akira. The 
kunoichi was simply too swift. All of Midori&#39;s energy was invested in 
fending off those lightening fast attacks. It was difficult to move her 
labrys at such a speed, and her muscles were starting to burn from the 
activity. Finally, more reinforcements arrived. Gakutenou was freed by 
Akane of all people as the others gathered around. Akira stopped. 
Yukariko held her ground. Nao was irritated with the interruption &#150; she 
had been doing well, damn it.

&quot;Where&#39;s Miyu?&quot; Shizuru asked. If anyone knew something about the 
detailed plans for an artificial Carnival, then she would.

&quot;Ran away, muttering something about some damn &#39;prime directive&#39; or 
whatever!&quot; Midori complained, waving her Element around in frustration. 
Akira had halted the moment the massive HiME group had gathered around. 
She had no desire to be fried by a dragon.

&quot;Prime directive? Is Arika in trouble, then? She&#39;s on one of the Otome 
defense teams, right? I thought I saw a Bolt from the Blue go off in the 
distance at one point, so maybe Miyu is worried about the beasts getting 
to her,&quot; Yukino chimed in from above, having dropped down once the 
fighting stopped. Diana was, after all, not the best when it came to 
conflict.

&quot;We don&#39;t have time to chase her,&quot; Shizuru said. &quot;Midori, Akira, and the 
rest of you. Look up.&quot;

&quot;Guiding Star? But I&#39;m not an Otome.&quot; Akira furrowed her brows in 
confusion.

Nao chuckled and turned back to face the young diplomat. &quot;If you can see 
that, then you&#39;re a HiME. That&#39;s not the Guiding Star anymore. Now it&#39;s 
something more sinister and destructive. I hope you like angst, little 
ninja girl, because there&#39;s probably going to be a lot more of it 
heading our way.&quot;

Natsuki watched from one of the buildings of Kyoto, and shook her head. 
Uniting for truth and justice, were they? Well, so much for the opening 
games of the new Carnival! What a way to ruin her newly found fun. She 
supposed that it didn&#39;t matter. They always started out united. In every 
Carnival, in every region of the world, they always tried to stay 
united. It never worked, and death always seemed inevitable by the end 
of things. That was what gave the Obsidian Lord that sweet taste of 
human sorrow and rage. Every building emotion was like an aging wine. It 
would be perfect after it had time to fester.

They could try to work as a team... but the moment that predictable 
unpredictability took hold, that would all be gone in a heartbeat. That 
untamed rage of hers was absolutely magnificent.</pre>
