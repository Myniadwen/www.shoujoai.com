<a href="../crossover/godcall-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Mara sat hidden in the shadows, watching as Priss pulled Urd to her 
feet, held her close, and begin to gently sway along with the soft 
music. She still wasn&#39;t quite sure why she was here, following them. 
The limo had pulled out from the Silky Doll, and Mara had fallen in 
behind it on her motorcycle, concealing herself from human eyes.

Seeing Urd with someone else, it should have been filling her with 
anger, but strangely, it wasn&#39;t. The feeling she had was more like 
regret, or maybe sorrow, for what might have once been between them. 
She got up, and prepared to leave the restaurant as quietly as she 
came, when she saw a familiar figure standing not too far away.

Sylia Stingray stood just out of the loving couple&#39;s line of sight, 
but she could see them both easily, a small smile teasing her lips. 
The corner spot she had claimed also gave the silver haired woman a 
clear view of the other patrons of the restaurant. Realizing that 
she&#39;d been spotted, Sylia raised her half full glass to Mara in a 
toast.

Without giving herself any time to think about it, Mara quietly made 
her way through the crowd, in a few moments reaching Sylia&#39;s side. 
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Mara asked her quietly, meeting Sylia&#39;s 
gaze.

&quot;I could ask the same of you,&quot; Sylia answered her calmly in return. 
She swirled the amber liquid in her glass, before gently placing it 
back on a nearby table. &quot;I suppose I&#39;m out playing fairy godmother 
tonight,&quot; Sylia said with a small, self-mocking smile, &quot;and I want to 
make sure that things turn out all right.&quot;

Mara looked over at Sylia, and for just a moment saw something else in 
Sylia&#39;s eyes, the hint of a deeply buried pain. &quot;There&#39;s something 
else,&quot; Mara asked her softly, &quot;isn&#39;t there?&quot;

Sylia looked at Mara in surprise, and then she obviously put her 
defenses back up. &quot;Maybe so,&quot; Sylia said dryly in reply, not really 
answering her question. She continued, &quot;So what are you doing here, 
then?&quot;

Mara looked over at Urd and Priss for a moment. Both had relaxed after 
the initial stiffness of dancing with a new partner had passed, and 
both looked like they were having fun. Urd laughed as Priss twirled 
her gently, then pulled her back in close to her. Mara wasn&#39;t sure she 
had ever seen Urd look so completely happy.

Speaking softly, so that Sylia could barely hear her words, Mara said 
&quot;I planned to cause a little trouble. I wanted this date of theirs to 
go up in flames.&quot; She shook her head a bit, &quot;But now...&quot; she trailed 
off, realizing who she was talking to.

Sylia smiled softly at her, the same sadness back in her expressive 
eyes. &quot;And now?&#39; she prompted Mara gently. Sylia wondered if the 
enigmatic demoness was here for the very same reason she was here.

&quot;I guess,&quot; Mara said with a sad sigh, &quot;I just came to say good-bye to 
her.&quot; She looked over at Urd one more time, a single tear glittering 
on her cheek, before she simply faded from view, until she completely 
disappeared.

Sylia finished her drink and prepared to go as well. She looked across 
at Urd and Priss, looking so good there as they danced slowly 
together. &quot;I guess I had to say my good-byes too,&quot; she sighed, and 
left before Priss could see her.



Belldandy hummed to herself happily as she knitted away. A large pile 
of completed cloth lay at her side, showing that she had been at it 
for awhile. Skuld walked by and stopped, frowning. &quot;Why are you doing 
that the hard way?&quot;

Belldandy smiled serenely, &quot;I&#39;m making a gift for Linna, a new 
sweater.&quot; She went back to concentrating on her knitting.

&quot;So why don&#39;t you just use your powers?&quot; Skuld asked irritably, 
instantly cross at the mere mention of Linna, the girl she blamed for 
corrupting her big sister. &quot;Or I could make you a machine to do it!&quot; 
she then suggested eagerly.

Belldandy just gently shook her head, as if Skuld was completely 
missing the point. &quot;This way, every single stitch of this sweater will 
be filled with my love for her,&quot; Belldandy sighed dreamily. &quot;My love 
itself will be wrapped all around her, keeping her safe and warm this 
winter,&quot; Belldandy concluded cheerfully.

Skuld looked at her big sister and sweatdropped. Only Belldandy could 
say something that was so totally sappy and fill it with such absolute 
sincerity. She sighed and shook her head before heading downstairs to 
talk with Nigel. At least he was rational, mostly.

Linna ducked back in the hallway, wiping at her eyes. She stumbled 
back up the hall to give herself a few minutes to regain her 
composure, she was so touched by what Belldandy had just said! A deep, 
steadying breath or two later, and Linna made her way into the room to 
be greeted by Belldandy&#39;s always sunny smile.

Not long after, Skuld sat on the floor by Nigel and passed him his 
tools even as he worked on completing the latest set of hardsuit 
upgrades. &quot;Is it me, or are they all crazy?&quot; Skuld finally asked him 
out of nowhere.

Without missing a beat, he calmly answered her, &quot;They&#39;re all crazy. 
Hand me that wrench, will ya?&quot;



Urd flopped into her seat, fanning herself with a handy napkin. &quot;All 
right,&quot; she conceded with a laugh, &quot;you really are a good dancer.&quot;

Priss laughed softly, taking a napkin herself to wipe her brow. 
&quot;You&#39;re not so bad yourself,&quot; she said, grinning across the table at 
her. They had pretty much danced everybody else on the dance floor 
into the ground, not to mention the band.

Urd picked up her half full wine glass and finished it in one big 
gulp. &quot;Ah, that&#39;s so nice,&quot; she sighed to herself happily. She then 
quickly polished off what food was left on her dinner plate, and Priss 
soon joined her.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Priss said with a smile, offering Urd her hand, &quot;this 
night&#39;s just getting started.&quot;

Urd took it and rose smoothly to her feet, smiling at Priss curiously. 
&quot;So what else do you have planned?&quot; she asked.

Priss led her out of the restaurant to the limo, &quot;You&#39;ll just have to 
wait and see.&quot; She grinned at Urd impishly.

Urd gave a mock pout. &quot;I feel like a prisoner being ferried off to an 
unknown fate,&quot; she complained with a smile.

Priss laughed evily, &quot;Just you wait, my pretty!&quot; They shared a laugh 
as the Limo doors popped open automatically.

&quot;Where to next, Madam?&quot; Mackie asked with his own version of the fake 
British accent. Nene rolled her eyes over how bad his was.

&quot;The club, I think,&quot; Priss said after taking a moment to pretend to 
think about it. Mackie raised his eyebrows at that.

&quot;Are you sure, Priss?&quot; Nene asked.

&quot;Yep,&quot; Priss answered her calmly. She then looked over at Urd, adding, 
&quot;They&#39;re worried about the club we&#39;re going to. We can leave as soon 
as you wish, though.&quot;

&quot;It sounds like a interesting place,&quot; Urd remarked Priss with a 
wolfish smile. Priss returned it in equal measure, and Nene was struck 
by how similar they could be.

The divider rose silently, and they were off to their next 
destination. Urd looked out the window and watched the buildings 
change as they drove, the polished, well maintained structures giving 
way to older buildings in clear disrepair.

&quot;Not the best part of town,&quot; Priss remarked quietly, &quot;but I started 
out here, all those years ago, and I used to sing at the club we&#39;re 
going to.&quot; She smiled wryly, &quot;I like going back there. It reminds me 
of where I&#39;ve been, and where I might end up.&quot;

Urd reached across the seat to put her hand on Priss&#39;. &quot;You won&#39;t end 
up here, not if I can help it,&quot; she vowed to her softly.

The limo slid to a stop before Priss could form a reply.

The divider that separated the front and back seats rolled down, and 
Nene smiled at them nervously as she said, &quot;This is your last chance, 
Priss. If you want to change your mind about this, now&#39;s the time.&quot;

Urd grinned and Priss laughed at her friends nervousness. &quot;I&#39;ll call 
you when we want to be picked up,&quot; Priss said with a smile. She looked 
at Nene and Mackie, adding, &quot;Why don&#39;t you two go for dinner or 
something?&quot;

Mackie grins at her in obvious relief, &quot;Thanks Priss. I don&#39;t want 
this limo sitting around this neighborhood too long,&quot; Several hoods 
walk by, giving the vehicle speculative looks. Mackie pales, and Priss 
laughed.

She got out and went around to help Urd, then they walked over the 
nearby club as the limo peeled away hastily. A large flashing neon 
sign is visible, reading &quot;Arisugawa&#39;s Locket&quot; and a locket opening to 
reveal a sexy girl beneath it.

&quot;Charming,&quot; Urd commented dryly, and Priss snorted with laughter.

&quot;The club&#39;s changed hands and names a few times since I last sang 
here,&quot; Priss commented as she held the door open. Urd walked in to 
meet the appreciative gazes of the well dressed crowd of women as 
Priss added, &quot;It&#39;s been a lesbian club for the last few years.&quot;

&quot;And the outside?&quot; Urd asked with a delighted smile. She looked around 
the club in no little awe, the soft carpeted floor, old fashioned long 
bar, karaoke stage, a library and some couches to read on, even! It 
looked like a gentleman&#39;s club of a bygone age, nothing like what 
you&#39;d expect to see from the total squalor outside.

&quot;Protective coloration,&quot; Priss answered with a grin. She spotted a 
friend in the crowd and waved at the woman, &quot;Hey, Juri, how&#39;s it 
going?&quot;

Urd laughed softly. &quot;Your friends don&#39;t know, do they?&quot; she stated 
more than asked.

Priss chuckled, &quot;I have asked them to come in, before. It&#39;s not my 
fault they wouldn&#39;t, is it?&quot; Priss tries her best to look innocent, 
and mostly fails.



In another bar, in another part of the sprawling city, Sylia Stingray 
downs another tall drink, calmly and deliberately. She looks well on 
her way to being drunk, surrounded by businessmen and executives 
working to attain that very same state.

&quot;Another, please,&quot; Sylia said quietly to the bartender. The pretty 
young woman looks at her nervously before pouring her yet another 
drink.

&quot;It can&#39;t be that bad,&quot; the lady says to her softly, trying to give 
Sylia an opportunity to talk about what was troubling her.

Sylia gives her such a look that it silences her almost instantly. &quot;I 
just helped set up the woman I used to love with a new girlfriend,&quot; 
she said it calmly, if just a little bit slowly so as to not slur any 
of the words, &quot;and it only just occurred to me that I&#39;m very unhappy 
about it.&quot; She slugged back the remainder of her drink, before setting 
the glass back on the counter with a loud thump.

&quot;Get me a drink too,&quot; the woman&#39;s voice said as a figure settled into 
the stool beside Sylia&#39;s. She looked over, and Mara smiled at her.

&quot;Have you been following me?&quot; Sylia asked mildly, tipping her glass to 
Mara with a little smile on her face.

&quot;Sorry, no,&quot; Mara said calmly. She raised her glass to the bartender 
and then downed it in one shot. She smiled and asked Sylia, &quot;Would you 
mind if I join you?&quot;

Sylia looked at her thoughtfully a moment. &quot;Sure, why not,&quot; Sylia 
finally said with a shrug, lightly tapping her glass to Mara&#39;s.

&quot;Cheers,&quot; Mara agreed with a smile.
