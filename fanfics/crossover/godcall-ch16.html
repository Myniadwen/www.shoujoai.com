throwing a concerned glance over at Belldandy, who was pouring them 
all cups of tea.

&quot;That&#39;s impossible, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Priss asked.

Skuld had a very worried look on her face. &quot;Not really,&quot; she admitted. 
She nodded towards Nene, &quot;She was able to disrupt something Mara set 
up, and her powers aren&#39;t all that different from a goddess&#39;, really.&quot;

&quot;The file was manufactured by Mara,&quot; Sylia cautioned them all, &quot;so I 
don&#39;t consider the data to be entirely trustworthy. But even so, it 
certainly is a point of concern.&quot;

&quot;Mara, in my experience, doesn&#39;t normally lie,&quot; Belldandy pointed out 
quietly.

&quot;Assuming they try something like that, we&#39;ll stop them,&quot; Urd said, 
making it a statement, not a question at all. There were nods of 
agreement all around.

&quot;We may need to assault Genom&#39;s Tokyo headquarters, at least,&quot; Nene 
said thoughtfully, looking ahead to that fateful day. She added with a 
smile, &quot;We&#39;ll need a plan.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve already been working on one,&quot; Sylia said. It was strange, but 
she seemed quite distracted, somehow. Almost as if there was something 
more important on her mind.

&quot;Leave it to Sylia to plan ahead,&quot; Linna smiled.

The silver haired woman didn&#39;t answer. Instead, Sylia suddenly got up, 
&quot;Skuld, could you help me with something?&quot;

The young goddess looked a bit startled by the abrupt question, but 
Skuld gamely answered her, &quot;Sure, I&#39;d be glad to.&quot;

&quot;What do you want us to do?&quot; Priss asked, realizing that something 
might be up.

&quot;Stick close to the Silky Doll,&quot; Sylia said as she led Skuld towards 
the elevator, &quot;just in case.&quot; The doors closed behind them even as she 
called Nigel, &quot;Meet us in the hardsuit lab.&quot;

&quot;What do you need my help with?&quot; Skuld asked Sylia as the elevator 
descended.

&quot;Some modifications to the hardsuits,&quot; Sylia said, adding more 
quietly, &quot;I just hope we&#39;re not already too late.&quot;

The doors opened and Nigel was waiting for them. &quot;Skuld, could you 
give us a minute?&quot; he asked her. He looked Sylia in the eye, &quot;We got 
to talk.&quot;



Jacobson looked at the image on his viewscreen, and fought to hide the 
nervousness he was feeling. &quot;We should be ready for a trial run within 
hours,&quot; Jacobson assured him.

&quot;I hope so,&quot; Quincy said softly, and the image cut out.

&quot;The containment vessel&#39;s ready,&quot; Megumi reported to Jacobson quietly. 
All of them were a bit shaken to hear from Quincy himself, and it 
showed.

Fairchild pushed a computer disk over the table to him, &quot;This should 
be the code we need to achieve access. No guarantees, though.&quot;

&quot;Today&#39;s as good a day as any,&quot; Hitomi reported, pushing her long hair 
back. &quot;The outlook on this isn&#39;t good, though,&quot; she said as she laid 
her Tarot cards out.

&quot;We&#39;ve got a deadline,&quot; Jacobson sighed, &quot;so let&#39;s get to it.&quot;

His team scattered, even as Jacobson himself took a walk around what 
could be considered to be his masterpiece. The computers worked 
silently, auto-dialing randomly in hopes of connecting to that one 
number they needed. If they reached a higher power, the codes devised 
by Fairchild would force down the being they sought, causing it to 
manifest on this physical plane. Finally, the being would be channeled 
into the containment device, unable to be released until they let it 
go.

Jacobson tried not to think about what would happen once they actually 
had one. He had very few illusions about the character of his 
superiors in Genom, or of its head, Quincy. Up until now, it had all 
been an academic exercise, a series of possibilities. Now, things were 
happening, and he wasn&#39;t entirely sure it was a good thing.

He noticed Hitomi was still sitting at the table, and her face was 
awfully pale. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Jacobson asked her softly.

She held up two cards, and a odd smile twisted her lips as Hitomi 
said, &quot;I drew these as the result cards: The Tower, and Death.&quot;

Jacobson sighed softly, &quot;Great, just great.&quot;



&quot;We&#39;re a bit busy right now, Nigel,&quot; Sylia said, frowning at the 
normally quiet man.

&quot;Won&#39;t take long,&quot; Nigel said quietly. &quot;Had a little talk with Mara 
earlier,&quot; he explained. He saw Sylia&#39;s face pale, and asked, &quot;What&#39;s 
going on?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m.. not sure,&quot; Sylia admitted softly. &quot;Mara seems to be somewhat 
interested in me, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s terribly relevant,&quot; she 
defended herself.

&quot;She was worried about you,&quot; Nigel said, then he smiled as he added 
&quot;she wanted to know if I was in love with you.&quot;

Sylia looked quite startled at that, covering with, &quot;I hope you told 
her we&#39;re both madly in love, of course.&quot;

He gave her a look, then Nigel said quietly, &quot;Mara really likes you, 
Sylia. You might want to start thinking about that more seriously.&quot; He 
left her then, walking over to stand by Skuld and to give Sylia a bit 
of time to recover.

&#39;Think about it,&#39; Sylia thought shakily, &#39;I&#39;ve been doing nothing else 
since that kiss!&#39; Mara had grabbed her on the way out, kissing her 
energetically, and even now Sylia felt her lips tingle a bit with the 
memory.

She shook herself, and visibly worked to try to get ahold of herself. 
She walked over to Skuld and Nigel, on the outside looking like her 
normally cool, composed self. &quot;I&#39;ve studied the readings of Mara&#39;s 
power usages from the construction site, and I think we can rig up 
some shielding units.&quot; Sylia explained to them.

&quot;Gonna need more than shields,&quot; Nigel noted.

Skuld nodded fiercely, a broad smile on her face, &quot;I&#39;ve got just the 
thing!&quot; Then she began calling up files on Sylia&#39;s computer screen.

&quot;Very nice,&quot; Sylia smiled.

Upstairs, a small council of war was taking place amound the others, 
while Henderson poured the tea for them as needed. Urd and Belldandy 
were mostly urging caution, though Urd didn&#39;t seem all that adverse to 
a good fight. Mackie and Nene were for taking a wait and see approach 
to the situation. And both Linna and Priss were all for a pre-emptive 
strike, going in to smash the equipment Genom had built before it 
could be built.

&quot;Finding where they are would be the biggest problem,&quot; Priss noted.

&quot;Maybe not,&quot; Nene said thoughtfully. &quot;I remember how Mara hacked 
Jacobson&#39;s systems while she was in my body, and I bet I could do it 
again,&quot; she smiled.

&quot;Assuming Jacobson hasn&#39;t fixed his defences,&quot; Mackie cautioned.

&quot;We don&#39;t even know if they have any working technology,&quot; Belldandy 
cautioned them.

&quot;No way Mara would be that worried unless they at least have the 
technology ready,&quot; Urd said, shaking her head. &quot;Why else would she 
have gone to all that trouble to give us the information?&quot; she asked 
them.

&quot;I thought Mara was here to see Sylia,&quot; Linna smiled. At that, a bit 
of a flush appeared on Urd&#39;s cheeks, as if she wasn&#39;t quite 
comfortable with the idea of Mara being with Sylia. &quot;She could just 
want us to attack Genom for kicks, you know,&quot; Linna pointed out.

&quot;Somehow, I doubt that,&quot; Priss admitted.



Mara smiled to herself, even as she stepped into the little apartment 
she had... appropriated, a few weeks ago. &#39;Everyone needs a base of 
operations,&#39; she thought.

Her expression became more serious, considering the situation. The 
last time she had snuck into Genom, she had seen what Jacobson&#39;s team 
was working on, and it even scared her. If they could actually pull 
off trapping a higher being, the balance of power between the Gods and 
Demons would never be the same.

A face appeared before her minds eye, fierce but beautiful, framed by 
silver hair. &#39;And then there&#39;s Sylia,&#39; Mara though, flopping down in 
her chair. It was getting harder and harder just to play around with 
her, Mara wanted something... else from her.

&quot;Wish I&#39;d been able to talk to Nigel longer,&quot; Mara murmured aloud. She 
hadn&#39;t expected that Nigel and Sylia weren&#39;t in lone. The man didn&#39;t 
seem to deeply care for her at all, in fact.

&#39;But does that mean she could care for someone like me?&#39; Mara mused. 
When they had talked, Sylia had admitted an attraction to Priss, but 
that was in the past. A slight smile quirked Mara&#39;s lips, thinking 
about the motel, and Sylia&#39;s sleeping form.

&quot;Sort of wish I&#39;d taken advantage of her then,&quot; Mara admitted to 
herself. It had taken a great deal of will power not to take advantage 
of Sylia while she was stripping her naked. It was even harder to go 
asleep beside her, knowing that she was laying naked inches away from 
her.

She shook her head, and Mara sighed out, &quot;I guess I&#39;ve got it bad for 
her.&quot;
