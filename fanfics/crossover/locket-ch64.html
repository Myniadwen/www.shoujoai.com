<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 64 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/locket-ch63.html">Back to Part 63</a><pre>&quot;Hi,&quot; Hitomi beamed as the two women came in, the
brown haired woman&#39;s bunny ears a bit floppy but still
cute looking, &quot;welcome to Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.&quot;

Aoi Futaba smiled, her police woman&#39;s uniform hugging
her curves as she purred, &quot;You look adorable!&quot;

Yoriko nodded, her glasses gleaming as she noticed the
basket of rabbit ears that sat beside Hitomi. She
plucked out one for her and Aoi as she chuckled
softly, &quot;We might as well get into the spirit of the
thing.&quot;

Hitomi chuckled softly as she confided, &quot;We&#39;ll be
having homemade chocolates later, Mahoro, Sasami and
May have been busy.&quot;

&quot;Oooh,&quot; Aoi grinned, &quot;we&#39;re sticking around, then.&quot;

Yoriko had to fight as smile as they moved through the
crowds, young women of many types crushing in around
them, all wearing different types of bunny ears.
Dressed in bathing suits, ears and tails the staff
looked especially cute, even Hyatt wiggling her way
across the floor.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Minagi grinned, her long blue hair flowing over
her shoulders as her breasts bounced in her red
bathing suit. She raised an eyebrow, her twin facial
scars making her look impish as she asked, &quot;Are Miyuki
and Natsumi working?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Yoriko agreed, &quot;but I understand they have
some extra treats in their lunch.&quot;

Not far away the two older women stood out a bit from
the crowd, both of them pushing their forties at
least. The brown haired woman who was dressed in pants
and button up shirt carried the drinks over to her
partner, sitting down with a sigh as she set the
glasses on the table.

&quot;Thank you Marin, &quot; the blonde smiled happily, her
stylish dress giving her a much more feminine style.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome Moe,&quot; Marin answered warmly. They
looked comfortable with each other, sitting close as
they watched the madness swirl around them, bunny ears
currently sitting on the table between them.

&quot;Hi there,&quot; Keiko beamed, her swimsuit slinging to her
thin frame, Her one bunny ear flopped down adorably as
she took their order then rushed off with a laugh,
only to return a few moments later with two dinner
specials.

&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; Moe asked, recognizing
the look on her love&#39;s face.

Marin chuckled softly, &quot;The most romantic thing you
ever said to me.&quot;

Moe blushed faintly, looking at Marin curiously, &quot;What
was that?&quot;

Marin reached out to gently lay her hand over Moe&#39;s.
&quot;When we thought I would have to go back to
Brigadoon,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;you refused to say
good-bye.&quot;

&quot;I told you I&#39;d wait for even a hundred years,&quot; Moe
remembered that moment fondly, &quot;if I could just see
you again.&quot;

Marin nodded smiling as she said, &quot;I think it was then
that I really began to understand how you felt about
me.&quot;

&quot;You might have told me how you felt about me,&quot; Moe
grumbled sweetly, &quot;I still remember how you kept
talking about finding someone like Melan Blue.&quot;

&quot;I did,&quot; Marin smiled, &quot;someone as strong and
courageous, as well as beautiful.&quot;

Moe blushed when she realized Marin met her.

Arisugawa Juri turned from where she stood watching
over by the library, the orange haired former duelist
smiling to herself slightly. It felt good seeing a
couple like that, two people who had managed to make
it for so many years. The elegant woman took a drink
of her usual ginger-ale, her black suit helping her
blend into the shadows.

&quot;Juri-sama!&quot; the bezerkly kawaii tones rang out as a
weight suddenly hit her in the back, nearly sending
her crashing to the floor.

&quot;Wakaba,&quot; Juri chuckled as she saw the beaming brown
haired girl&#39;s face so close to her own, eyes
twinkling. She helped the girl slide down to the
ground as she asked her, &quot;How are you doing tonight?&quot;

&quot;Pretty good,&quot; Wakaba smiled, pushing her curly hair
back. The dress she wore was simple but cute, white
with some red trim added on.

They walked up towards the bar together as Juri
curiously asked the smaller woman, &quot;And how&#39;s the
dating thing going?&quot;

Wakaba blushed faintly as she confessed, &quot;I have a
blind date, actually, something Keiko and May helped
set up for me.&quot;

Juri thought about warning the girl about the kind of
trouble you could get into on blind dates, but she
decided to keep her mouth shut. Learning about blind
dates was one of those many things you pretty much had
to do yourself.

&quot;Not a good idea, huh?&quot; Wakaba quickly understood
Juri&#39;s silence.

&quot;You could get lucky,&quot; Juri offered hopefully.

&quot;Isn&#39;t getting lucky the idea?&quot; Wakaba chuckled and
Juri rolled her eyes. Wakaba noticed a figure sitting
at the corner table and gulped, &quot;I think that&#39;s her!&quot;

Juri looked up then blinked in surprise as she
recognized the beautiful older woman. &#39;Nagisa?&#39; she
thought, watching the blue haired woman smoothly
finish a drink. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t advise going home with her
on the first date,&quot; Juri said dryly.

&quot;You know her?&quot; Wakaba asked curiously.

&quot;By reputation, at least,&quot; Juri answered with a sigh,
giving the girl a wave as Wakaba headed off to meet
her fate. A pair of familiar looking young women
walked by and Juri nearly did a double take before
realizing they were alternates of people she knew.

Minako Aino smiled as she looked around at the bar,
her blonde hair glowing under the rose rabbit ears she
wore. A matching bathing suit with a cute bunny&#39;s tail
was combined with long white stockings and pink shoes
to complete the outfit.

Hotaru Tomoe wore a black lace corset, combined with a
leotard to preserve her modesty. Black gloves, boots
and ash colored stockings went with the black and rose
bunny ears she had chosen to wear, combining to make
her look like some kind of Goth-bunny.

&quot;Love, this outfit might just be a little bit too
much,&quot; Hotaru murmured, gently but firmly holding on
to Minako&#39;s arm.

Minako chuckled softly as they made their way to the
bar and admitted, &quot;I think I got a bit carried away.&quot;
She smiled, &quot;I think the looks you&#39;re getting are
worth it, though.&quot;

Hotaru gave Minako a scolding look, &quot;I&#39;m not quite the
show off you are, Mina.&quot;

&quot;Hota-chan,&quot; Minako teased, stopping a moment to kiss
her, &quot;you have secret depths that even you don&#39;t know
about.&quot; She smiled wickedly, &quot;Though I&#39;m certainly
enjoying helping you to discover each and every one.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a bad girl,&quot; Hotaru said, smiling happily as
they resumed walking.

&quot;Yo,&quot; Ryouko looked up from mixing drinks to grin, her
two piece bathing suit leaving very little to the
imagination.

&quot;And you thought your costume was a bit much?&quot; Minako
teased Hotaru softly.

&quot;I stand corrected,&quot; a blushing Hotaru said.

Ryouko laughed, her long hair tied up in two ponytails
to resemble bunny ears. &quot;Blame my girlfriend,&quot; she
explained cheerfully, &quot;so what can I get you two?&quot;

Minako and Hotaru placed their orders and left,
leaving Ryouko, Minagi and Mahoro to cover the length
of the long bar. &quot;Good evening,&quot; the voice seemed to
resonate somewhere in Ryouko&#39;s memory, &quot;is Ayeka here,
too?&quot;

&quot;Who wants to know?&quot; Ryouko turned to look at the
woman only to stop in surprise.

Silvery hair flowed down her back, flowing against the
traditional kimono she wore. She was almost agelessly
beautiful, serene yet with a merry twinkle in her
eyes. Tennyo, the sister of Tenchi Masaki and
grand-niece to Ayeka herself smiled as she said, &quot;I
come bearing a message to both of you from Ayeka&#39;s
grandmother.&quot;

To be continued...

The Staff: The bar&#146;s owner is Arisugawa Juri, from
Revolutionary Girl Utena. Minagi, Ryouko and Sasami
are from the series Tenchi Muyo. Keiko is also from
Utena. Cyberdoll May is from Hand Maid May. Hyatt is
from Excel Saga. Lastly, Hitomi is from Escaflowne,
the movie.

Our Cast This Episode: Aoi and Yoriko are from You&#39;re
Under Arrest. Marin and Moe are from Brigadoon. Wakaba
is from Revolutionary Girl Utena. Nagisa is from Here
is Greenwood. Hotaru and Minako are from Sailor Moon.
And finally, Tennyo and Ayeka are from Tenchi Muyo.

Authors Notes: Moe and Marin from Brigadoon are
described in this chapter as being &#39;pushing their
forties&#39; because Brigadoon is set in an alternate
1960s, more or less. I&#39;ve been meaning to slip them in
an episode, so here they are. Minako and Hotaru are a
tip of the hat to &#39;starsinlove&#39; a yahoo group based on
that alternate pairing that I&#39;m a member of. Finally,
the character of Tennyo is from the new Tenchi Muyo
ovas, a character I&#39;m rather intrigued by. Heh.</pre>
