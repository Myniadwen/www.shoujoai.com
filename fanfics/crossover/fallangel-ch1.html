<pre>Major Misato Katsuragi frowned as the UN peacekeeper and Japanese Self 
Defense Force officer studied the latest updates on what was being 
called &quot;the skyhook affair.&quot; It appeared one or more boomers had 
successfully taken over the skyhook, and were attempting some sort of 
assault on the Earth. As army forces had begun to mobilize to launch an 
attack an official all clear signal had been broadcast, and now things 
were eerily silent as the world tried to restore lost systems crashed in 
the attack.

The chirping of the phone brought Misato out of her contemplation of the 
reentry data on several unidentified objects as the black haired young 
woman pressed the receive button without looking and asked, &quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Misato, it&#39;s Sylia,&quot; she heard the familiar voice say.

&quot;Sylia?!&quot; Misato turned, blinking in surprise as she looked at the 
visibly tired silver haired woman staring out of the video screen.

&quot;It&#39;s been awhile,&quot; Sylia admitted, &quot;but you said I could ask you a 
favor back then, and it seems I have to now.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s hear it,&quot; Misato smiled.

Nearly five years ago Misato had been in Tokyo, working with the 
military police investigating a rogue boomer incident. Frustrated with 
Genom stonewalling she had contacted the daughter of the creator of the 
boomers, hoping for some information. Instead they eventually found 
themselves fighting for their lives against a illegal boomer assassin, 
and in the end Sylia had saved her life.

&quot;Certain contacts I have at NASA have reported several objects falling 
from the Skyhook,&quot; Sylia said coolly, &quot;I think they may be survivors, 
using escape pods. They need to be recovered quickly, in case they&#39;ve 
been injured.&quot;

Misato got the sense there was more going on than Sylia was telling, and 
she suspected the pods may well contain agents working for her. Either 
way, there were people possibly in danger and her responsibility was 
clear. &quot;One of the pods landed nearby our desert base,&quot; Misato smiled, 
&quot;as I&#39;m sure you know.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Sylia smiled slightly.

&quot;I&#39;ll take a team out and check it out,&quot; Misato said briskly.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sylia nodded then sighed as she added, &quot;now I get to try to 
find my other two lost little lambs.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Misato nodded.

&quot;Oh, if you find any... exotic technology on the scene?&quot; Sylia smiled 
charmingly, &quot;Please destroy it, it could be hazardous.&quot;

Misato gave her a thoughtful look but nodded, &quot;Understood.&quot;

Priss Asagiri scowled, crouching nearly nude on a sand dune as she 
waited for either a unlikely rescue or probable death. Neither 
possibility endeared themselves to the dark brown haired warrior, but it 
seemed she had little option. Her grand gesture to sing to the sunrise 
had helped to dry her out even more than she might have other wise done, 
and the wreckage of her hardsuit provided little cover.

&quot;No food, little shelter,&quot; Priss murmured as she tried to use a dead 
tree for some cover, &quot;and no water. Face it, you&#39;re fucked.&quot; Still, 
Priss found herself refusing to give up, maybe because the Knight Sabers 
had survived so many other life threatening situations.

Gazing off into the distance Priss at first thought it was just a 
hallucination, something brought on by the heat. Off in the distance a 
sliver of light gleamed, metal reflecting the sunlight as it soared 
forward. Rising and waving her arms Priss felt a surge of pure relief, 
unmindful that she was totally nude.

&quot;Holy shit,&quot; Matoko muttered, the brown haired pilot&#39;s eyes wide as he 
gazed at the pretty girl they were approaching.

&quot;Eyes on the road,&quot; Misato casually hit him in the back of the head, 
though honestly she was noticing her physical beauty too. &#145;I thought I 
was just like this around Sylia,&#39; she silebtly thought, &#145;I guess not.&#39;

Priss watched the copter descend, staying back far enough that flying 
sand wouldn&#39;t sting her bare skin, then once it was down she hurried 
over as the side door opened. The woman standing there looked 
comfortable in her uniform, her dark hair falling into her eyes as she 
smiled, holding out a large overcoat for her.

&quot;I&#39;m Major Misato Katsuragi,&quot; she introduced herself as Priss gave her a 
wary look, &quot;but I figure it matters more that Sylia sent me.&quot;

&quot;Priss Asagiri,&quot; she relaxed a bit as she pulled the heavy coat around 
her. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she replied as Misato waved her to a bench bolted to the 
wall then asked her curiously, &quot;though I wonder how did she get a UN 
Major to come save me?&quot;

&quot;I owed her a favor,&quot; Misato replied honestly. She gave her a slight 
smile, &quot;Sylia tells me her two other lost lambs are fine, Priss.&quot;

&quot;Thank god,&quot; Priss murmured, suddenly looking deeply tired.

&quot;Well get you back to base,&quot; Misato added quietly as she reached out to 
squeeze the woman&#39;s shoulder, &quot;then figure out how to send you back home 
to Japan.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Priss gave her an exhausted smile then after a moment slumped 
up against the wall, out cold.

Grabbing her spare red jacket Misato made her way up to the front of the 
copter. &quot;We going now?&quot; Matoko asked as he watched her pin her rank bars 
on her clothes.

&quot;I need to check the crash site,&quot; Misato said briskly, &quot;keep an eye on 
her while I&#39;m gone.&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Makoto said a bit too eagerly.

&quot;Don&#39;t get fresh,&quot; Misato warned him briskly, &quot;she looks tough enough to 
geld you, exhausted or not.&quot;

Makoto paled a bit, &quot;Ah, right.&quot;

With a satisfied smile Misato left him, only lingering a moment to 
gently pat Priss on the shoulder and grab a small item from a nearby 
weapons rack. Then at a brisk trot she headed over to where it looked 
like Priss had come down then knelt to examine the rubble. While no 
expert on tech she could tell it was toasted, but looking at it the 
materials did remind her of something.

&#145;Bet my bosses would love to study a piece of Knight Saber technology,&#39; 
Misato silently mused before taking a thermite grenade out of her jacket 
pocket. &#145;Oh well,&#39; she set the timer and tossed it into the depression 
the landing had made then sprinted back to the chopper before the device 
detonated.

WHOOMPH!

&quot;What the hell was THAT?&quot; Makoto blurted as she came on board, shielding 
his eyes from the light sent from the still burning metal.

&quot;Destroyed the remains of the escape pod,&quot; Misato quickly improvised, 
&quot;just in case it was infected by whatever happened up there.&quot;

&quot;That... makes sense,&quot; Makoto admitted after a moment. Rather 
plaintively he asked, &quot;Can we go home now?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Misato hesitated then sat down beside the now fast asleep Priss, 
easing a arm around her for safety&#39;s sake, &quot;take up back to base.&quot;

&quot;Are aye,&quot; Makoto answered, starting up the engines to a soft purr then 
they lifted off, skimming across the sands to home.

Priss hovered in the soft area between wakefulness and sleep as they 
raced along, the swaying of the ship rocking her gently as she felt the 
arm holding her safe. Like any sleeping child she snuggled close to the 
source of comfort, murmuring to herself sleepily as she rested her head 
on Misato&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Oh hell,&quot; Misato murmured as the mostly naked pilot nearly crawled into 
her lap. Keeping a firm grip on Priss she found herself unwillingly 
taking in the details of her body, from attractive breasts to long, sexy 
legs. Doing her best to protect Priss&#39; remaining modesty she muttered, 
&quot;Damn my conscience...&quot;

Craning his neck to watch Makoto grinned, &quot;Having some problems, boss?&quot;

&quot;Shut up and drive,&quot; Misato growled as she disentangled herself from 
Priss.

&#145;Too bad,&#39; Makoto thought as he turned back to his piloting reluctantly, 
&#145;that was pretty damn sexy looking.&#39;

Nearly ten minutes later a visibly flushed and a little breathless 
looking Misato gently reached out to shake Priss awake. &quot;We&#39;re here,&quot; 
she croaked, then cleared her throat before repeating that a bit more 
normally.

Priss stretched, then the young woman clutched at the coat she wore. 
&quot;Thanks for the nap,&quot; she yawned, &quot;I needed that.&quot;

&quot;But was it good for Misato too?&#39; Makoto wondered softly as they settled 
onto the desert peacekeeping station.

&quot;Makoto,&quot; Misato growled threateningly while making sure Priss didn&#39;t 
hear it.

Priss raised an eyebrow sardonically, but decided she didn&#39;t want to 
know. &quot;So what do I do know?&quot; she buttoned up the overcoat as they 
stepped off the copter then yelped as her bare feet hit the hot stone of 
the landing pad.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Misato gently hustled her over to the buildings nearby and 
out of the sun. In a more business like tone she added, &quot;We&#39;ll get you 
cleaned up and dressed, then I&#39;ll talk to the base commander about 
getting you back home.&quot; She winked as they went inside, &quot;Hopefully with 
a minimum amount of inconvenient questions.&quot;

&quot;Like how I got up there in the first place?&quot; Priss smiled wryly.

&quot;Questions like that, yeah,&quot; Misato agreed as she lead her to the 
doctor&#39;s office first. &quot;Brace yourself,&quot; she warned, &quot;Ritsuko is a 
bit... interesting.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Priss asked.

&quot;Oh Maya!&quot; Ritsuko moaned as the blonde doctor ardently kissed a 
shorter, dark haired female officer.

&quot;Should we come back later?&quot; Priss drawled.

&quot;Ritsuko!&quot; Misato scolded.</pre>
