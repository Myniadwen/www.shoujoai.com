<a href="../crossover/jetiendo-ch30.html">Back to Part 30</a><pre>Misty&#39;s room was beautiful the purple walls looked like fabric. The 
walls where all purple and the ceiling looked like an aquarium, the 
double bed was a waterbed the designs where all perfect.

&quot; Thanks Misty,&quot; Kari gasped speechless, she gave her a kiss in return. 
&quot;You&#39;re my best friend and I love you so much&quot;

&quot; Let&#39;s make the most of tonight,&quot; Misty demanded. Temptation got the 
better of them as they fell in the bed under the silky pillows took 
their dresses also made out of silk and hugged each over. Or you could 
say having sex. Mouths firmly connected together. Hyper tongues. Dancing 
minds. Body&#39;s full of pleasure as their hearts where confident.

Ash and May where alone outside. May and Ash started talking about Misty 
and Kari&#39;s lesbian relationship,

&quot; I don&#39;t care&quot; Ash replied weirdly, &quot; I&#39;m glad Misty&#39;s happy, we&#39;ve 
both moved on&quot; Ash got down to his knees holded out a lush diamond ring 
from his pocket took of the glove of May&#39;s left hand and placed it on 
the engagement finger.&quot; May, will you marry me?&quot;

&quot;YES&quot; May cried out, as she let a happy cry as she hugged him &quot; can we 
get married on valentines day?&quot;

&quot;Of coarse we can&quot; Ash whispered back &quot; a simple wedding&quot;

&quot; Ok&quot;

&quot;HORARY!&quot; Dec roared, &quot;ASH AND MAY ARE GETTING MARRIED!&quot; so that the 
whole world can hear

&quot;CAN I COME?&quot; Ant asked

&quot;Ok&quot; May smiled.

&quot; We&#39;re going to the wedding&quot; Dec smiled

&quot; I am going&quot; Ant confronted &quot; they said nothing about you going&quot;

Dec was gutted

&quot; Okay Dec you can come is well&quot; Ash reacted

Ant and Dec are where celebrating and they went into the hall and 
shouted across the entire hall

&quot;ASH AND MAY ARE GETTING MARRIED&quot;

The students all rushed to them looking at May&#39;s finger to see if it 
where true.</pre>
