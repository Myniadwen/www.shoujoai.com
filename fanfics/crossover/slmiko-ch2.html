&lt;April 17, 1999&gt;
The sun stood low in the sky as it illuminated the streets of Tokyo. 
It was a nice, spring evening, with almost summer-like temperatures 
and a tepid breeze was providing just the right kind of climate to 
mill around outside. It was Saturday and many were taking advantage of 
the beneficial weather to do just that.
	Somewhere in the vicinity of the Azabu-Juuban district a young 
woman was currently preparing for her own enjoyment of a relaxing 
evening. It was a welcoming distraction from the chaos of the last 
weeks. So, by all means, she should be looking forwarding to spending 
some time away from duties, work and everything else that was 
occupying her time lately. She should look forward to get away from 
all of this...
	&quot;How exactly did I let myself be talked into this,&quot; Rei mused 
with a mixture of annoyance, reluctance and a bit of fond amusement. 
The cause of her mixed feelings about the matter was once again her 
recent assistant/apprentice who had somehow managed, against all her 
protest, to talk her into spending some time in town on a fair that 
was currently held close to Hikawa Jinja. Actually, it was held in 
Harumi, just a short bus ride to the east of the Maison apartment 
block. It wasn&#39;t that far away.
	Now, she would have had no problem with that but she was really 
not feeling in the mood at all. The last two weeks had taken a lot out 
of her and weekends were about the only time she could remotely relax, 
especially now that she had, unwillingly or not, someone to split the 
duties around the Jinja with.
	It was true that Sasami had proven to be a big help around the 
shrine. Rei had the impression that the girl had vastly understated at 
just how much she had helped around her family&#39;s shrine, or maybe she 
was just really fast in picking up new stuff. The miko had started 
easy, wanting to see just how much she could put on the younger girl&#39;s 
shoulders but after about a week had passed had to admit that whatever 
chore she handed the girl, Sasami would usually take care of it 
without EVER asking a question or for assistance. Sometimes it eerily 
appeared as if she was being guided by something higher, something the 
normal eye could not perceive. It reminded Rei of the feeling she had 
on the night of her arrival here and she had not come much closer in 
figuring out the mysteries that surrounded the blue-haired girl with 
the close resemblance to their beloved princess.
	Sighing, Rei proceeded to finish with putting on the purple and 
red kimono, thinking back on just how it had come that she was here 
now, ready to go to a fair with her secretive new companion who she 
really barely knew, instead of meditating or maybe catching up on some 
homework...

******************************

&lt;A while earlier (Rei)&gt;
The air outside was unusual warm for the middle of April. Not that it 
never happened but I was a bit surprised considering the last weeks 
had covered Tokyo in a constant mixture of rain and barely tolerable 
levels of temperature. The change was actually rather welcome. Good 
weather simplified a lot of things around the shrine. With rain you 
always had to work an extra bit more afterwards to clean and dry the 
ground and be careful to keep nothing out in the open that could get 
easily soaked. On account of my divided attention a lot of that had 
actually wormed its way into the regions of regularity until about a 
week ago.
	It&#39;s been nine days now actually since my new assistant had 
wormed herself into my home... and was providing to be an exceptional 
help that I would be hard-pressed to reject now that I knew how 
willingly she was to justify her stay. Sasami had proven to be more 
than just the occasional helping hand, relieving of some of the 
lesser, more annoying tasks so that I could concentrate on the actual 
shrine business. In fact the blue-haired girl possessed an almost 
scary amount of spiritual power. I couldn&#39;t believe she was never 
properly trained. Someone had to have trained her because she 
continued to display a sensitivity that I had worked years on to 
achieve myself. She barely showed it, but one who had trained as a 
miko nearly all her life could easily pick up the signs in small 
actions.
	Sasami wasn&#39;t a believer though. Not as much as I was, having 
been raised in the ways of Shinto. She was familiar with very few 
rituals and from what I had been able to discern so far, even this 
knowledge was flawed or... maybe just simply different. Maybe the 
shrine she had lived near at had practiced variations I was not 
familiar with... Not that they were less successful, just different. 
Yes, that was it.
	I hadn&#39;t been able to find out more about her background except 
a last name... Which I considered a surprise by itself, kind of 
disrupting my still nagging suspicion that she was a runaway. I had 
made a few calls but neither of the neighboring shrines I was familiar 
with knew anything about a Masaki family one, nor did I found it 
listed anywhere. The best I could imagine was that it was really just 
a small one, somewhere further away, probably in a remote region. That 
made the most sense... or the girl was just outright lying... which I 
found myself vehemently refusing to believe.
	One thing I had gotten used to though. Her flawless, nearly 
invisible aura. That is why I knew exactly that Sasami had just 
entered the living area, otherwise I might have been surprised once 
more. Not only was there the hard to detect aura but she was rather 
light-footed, her steps barely making any sound as if she were 
floating. It only added to the mystery.
	My eyebrows rose spotting a nervous expression and a bouquet of 
flowers clutched in front of her. The blue-haired girl met my gaze 
with a certain trepidation before resolve masked it. She tentatively - 
nervously actually - held out the flowers. Casablanca lilies I noted 
immediately, producing a flash of mixed memories. &quot;Um, I bought those 
for you. Happy Birthday, Hino-san.&quot;
	I blinked in open amazement at the offered flowers and the one 
holding them. I had NOT told her. I usually never told anyone about my 
birthday. My friends only found out by chance and usually they knew I 
didn&#39;t want to make a great fuss about it. Birthdays had rarely been 
anything special in the past until I met the others. They&#39;ve become a 
bit more... enjoyable then, but even that only in the latter years 
when Usagi and Minako especially had made sure to at least throw the 
occasional party. And how the hell did she know about the flowers? 
After the latest fiascos I pretty much had canceled the usual birthday 
meetings with my father, knowing fully well that he didn&#39;t even care 
the little bit about family anymore as he pretended to do. The flowers 
hadn&#39;t even been his. They had been Kaidou-san&#39;s and I had told him in 
no uncertain terms some years ago already that I didn&#39;t want the false 
gifts anymore. They were fine when coming from my friends, at least I 
knew the origin was genuine there but...
	Startled out of my reflections I realized I had stared a bit too 
long. Sasami was getting pretty anxious and seemed to fear a rejection 
or other negative reaction. The girl, that much I learned, was eager 
to please. Not that she was ready to lick your shoes, to put it 
extremely, but I detected a certain longing for attention, to see 
other people happy made her happy herself. Her cooking - which was 
absolutely fabulous - was only one example. Every time a compliment 
was thrown her way, she would smile happily. Not exaggeratedly but in 
a positively infatuating way. Sasami was someone who didn&#39;t like 
seeing someone sad or angry... another striking resemblance to 
Usagi...
	Taking the lilies carefully from the younger girl&#39;s hands, I 
smiled in a simple gesture of gratitude at the effort, knowing from 
her reaction alone that she just wanted to be nice. We hadn&#39;t been 
able to spent much time during the last week and the girl was 
obviously making an effort to be friendly. Catching up in college and 
the Jinja had occupied me most of the time and the one I had to spare 
was mostly spent to incorporate my new assistant into the daily 
routine which for the first days was actually a bit of extra work, 
considering that I had to sacrifice time to watch over her, to see how 
she was doing. It got much better after I realized that Sasami 
wouldn&#39;t need any supervision for the most mundane tasks.
	&quot;Arigato, Sasami-chan. Those are very nice.&quot; I breathed in the 
smell of the flowers before getting up to get them into fresh water. 
Busying myself with that task, and steadying myself again from the 
effects of the simple yet strangely dizzying smile of the other girl, 
I asked casually, &quot;So, how did you know?&quot;
	Sasami fidgeted slightly before answering. &quot;Jiichan told me...&quot; 
Somehow, I wasn&#39;t surprised. Grandfather had taken an instant liking 
towards the new resident in our Jinja, although I had the slight 
suspicion that that had a lot to do with her cooking and the near 
motherly attention Sasami had devoted upon him. Surprisingly enough 
her simple presence managed to combat his sickness better when any 
medicine before. I suppose there really was something curing about a 
joyful smile and a happy spirit in the house...
	&quot;I see,&quot; I answered simply. Not quite knowing just how much my 
grandfather had told her but almost sure it had something to do with 
my lacking enthusiasm for my birthday, I added, &quot;It&#39;s alright. I don&#39;t 
mind. Actually that&#39;s my first gift today.&quot; I allowed myself a smile 
and was immediately answered with a look of gratitude filling red-pink 
eyes. The statement was somewhat true. Grandfather hadn&#39;t been able to 
get out of bed much for the last weeks but he knew I wasn&#39;t expecting 
anything to begin with. And so far none of my friends had shown up... 
which DID have its reasons.
	I noticed that Sasami hadn&#39;t moved from where she was. In fact 
she looked even more pensive than before. As eager as the girl was too 
please, she seemed to be REALLY careful not to do or say anything 
wrong during the first week living and working here. &quot;What is it, 
Sasami-chan?&quot; I asked as neutrally as possible.
	&quot;Well, I was wondering. I heard there was a fair over in 
Harumi... I haven&#39;t been to a fair for some time. I know I&#39;ve not been 
here for long but if you don&#39;t mind I&#39;d like to go and... maybe you 
want to go, too?&quot;
	I knew I had lost the argument before it even began, I had 
absolutely no defense against the innocently, pleading expression, 
worming itself through every shield I would have normally been able to 
erect. I was really not in the mood for an outing. I would have simply 
liked to stay at home, maybe meditate a little and catch up on some 
homework. And it wasn&#39;t too hard to realize where the real reason for 
the request lay. Sasami obviously wanted me to do something off-duty 
for a change. I would have refused. I really would have... but the 
effect the girl had on me had actually increased since the first day. 
It was vexing, irritating, frustrating... It was useless to resist.

******************************

(Sasami)
I didn&#39;t believe that Hino Rei was a cold person. Actually that would 
be about the total opposite of her innermost self. I didn&#39;t believe 
she was distant or... aloof either. I&#39;ve heard some visitors talk when 
they thought no one was listening but I couldn&#39;t quite believe what 
they were saying. That she didn&#39;t have any friends or that she came 
across as somewhat scary and otherworldly at most times.
	Many things had quickly disposed of those rumors for me. In 
fact, all I really had to do was to think of Ayeka when she was under 
stress which more or less was a constant during the last year. Before 
we had come back to Jurai, my sister had been considerably more 
relaxed. After all the adventures spent together she had lost most of 
her haughty demeanor and could easily let go of the mask she had been 
trained to wear for years before that. During the last year I had 
rarely seen the more carefree girl who would enjoy to spend time with 
her friends and family. A rather saddening thing, one that had played 
a minor role in our decision to leave... but that wasn&#39;t important. 
What was important was that I always knew that this softer side still 
existed but every day life forced her to suppress it.
	I had seen Rei interact with one of her friends. Or I at least 
believed the Kino girl was a friend and not just an acquaintance. The 
brunette didn&#39;t strike me as a miko or priestess. Rei was considerable 
more relaxed around the other girl. She had only been there once or 
twice during the week I&#39;ve spent at Hikawa Jinja but it was enough to 
let me know that the notion of Hino Rei not having any friends was 
simply hilarious.
	Stress almost always was a factor that could mess up most of 
your life and make you do things you later regretted. With the 
illustrious circle of my extended family, I had gotten to know many 
different characters, often proving to be more multi-layered when one 
would believe on the first glance. My sister and Ryoko were just one 
example.
	I had mostly stood on the sidelines during our adventures here 
on Earth but that had also given me time to analyze those people 
around me and I had gotten pretty good at that. My intuition now was 
telling me that I should try hard to make a friend out of Rei and that 
with the right balance of patience and persuasion that should easily 
be possible. Besides, I was really curious about the strange 
connection to her I could feel whenever we were in each other&#39;s close 
presence. It was a bit irritating, making me act more shyly than usual 
but it was also mysterious and well, what could I say? I loved 
mysteries.
	We clearly were making for an odd couple. The older, composed 
miko in her very fitting purple kimono and I in the red and white one 
which had been a gift from Tenchi once. If not for the lack of any 
resemblance we could have been older and younger sister walking over 
the grounds of the fair. As it was we drew quite some stares from the 
guest, our individual appearances radiating a sharp contrast. Neither 
really cared. I was actually too happy to have succeeded in my plan 
for the evening and Rei didn&#39;t seem to be bothered by the looks at 
all.
	The fair - a spring festival that seemed relatively new to me - 
was held on the dock areas of Harumi. There was a wide and open space 
in the center and enough between the bigger depots to fit many 
different kinds of draws and booths. The entire thing had the typical 
feel of a fair, there were many booths to win prizes at by competing 
in games of skill. I remembered the few ones we had been too fondly, 
although after our more than unfairly over-talented group had been let 
loose on some, there were enough of the participants who wanted 
nothing more than for us to leave...
	There was a certain feel to the place that had me a little 
distracted though. Especially the large space which was currently 
filled with all sort of attractions and a large crowd having gathered 
around what I believed was some kind of trickster performing &quot;magic 
tricks&quot;. There was the distant sensation of a portal here, of what 
kind and nature I couldn&#39;t tell, neither could Tsunami, but I had the 
impression that my other half was becoming slightly nostalgic, as if 
some memories had suddenly been stirred.
	I shrugged the feeling of, being used to Tsunami&#39;s bouts of 
reflections - after all I wasn&#39;t really unsusceptible for them myself 
- when I felt a hand on my shoulder. I glanced to the side to see Rei 
follow my gaze. And she was really following it, not just assuming I 
was watching the man performing his tricks. &quot;Can you sense it too. The 
mystical energy running through this place?&quot;
	Pondering what to do, I finally decided that it would amount me 
no trust to downplay the matter. Rei was pretty sharp and I doubted 
she would buy a negative response. I wasn&#39;t really sure how much of my 
powers I wanted to give away just yet. It could frighten the older 
girl or maybe just make her wary than all I wanted was her friendship. 
I settled for a nod and an affirmative murmur in the end, waiting 
whether or not Rei would pursue the matter.
	She didn&#39;t and after a longer period of silence where we just 
stood amongst the crowd watching the man doing his tricks with an 
arrogance as if he REALLY knew magic, I risked another glance at my 
older companion and was pleasantly surprised to find a wry grin on her 
face, obviously finding the act just as ridiculous as I did in light 
of the kinds of real magic we had encountered. If Tsunami was right 
with her assumption - and I had no reason to question that -, the miko 
had obviously seen enough more supernatural than your average shrine 
attendant would in all their life.
	All that was trivial though because my trained eye - as I said I 
had had enough practice - could clearly see that the raven-haired 
beauty was starting to relax, the tension that had been easily visible 
to someone who knew what to look for, was starting to drain away. Rei 
shook her head with a bemused smile when the trickster finished his 
act by letting a bunch of birds emerge from seemingly out of nowhere, 
making the crowd go into &quot;aww&quot;s and &quot;oh&quot;s... Without a problem we 
slipped out of the spellbound gathering.
	&quot;I suppose I should thank you,&quot; Rei said to my pleasant 
surprise. &quot;I really needed some distraction from textbooks, endless 
calculations, and even tending to things around the shrine.&quot; She 
looked around the area casually. &quot;Usually I&#39;m not that much of a fan 
of festivals but I guess it&#39;s better than spending your birthday alone 
at home or... elsewhere...&quot; The miko broke the sentence off, a 
melancholic shadow creeping over her features for just the barest of 
moments. Then it was gone again, replaced once more by a friendly, 
warm smile.
	Filing away the occurrence but not pressing the issue at all, I 
was quick to amend, &quot;You just looked like you needed it, Hino-san. 
My... Oneechan is like that too when she&#39;s under stress so I kind of 
know how that is like. Besides, you let me stay for free at your Jinja 
without barely knowing me. This is the least I could do, right?&quot;
	Rei&#39;s gaze softened even more and I felt myself beginning to 
flush, feeling the strange connection again. I had a vague idea of 
what it was but was careful to draw any premature conclusion. I&#39;ve 
only known the young woman for nine days after all. &quot;It is that 
natural for you, isn&#39;t it?&quot; my hostess asked with an odd but 
definitely appreciating tone. Not sure how to take the comment, I just 
gave a small nod. Rei&#39;s smile deepened in response, warming my heart 
and letting me know of a faster success in my intentions as I had 
hoped for. She was rather different right now from what I had seen 
around the Jinja during the last week. The change came about rather 
drastic...
	*Sometimes you just don&#39;t know the effect you have on other 
people.* I barely refrained from the urge to exclaim something out 
loud at Tsunami&#39;s comment but then became aware that Rei had moved her 
hand to touch my own, sending a brief spark of electricity through my 
body. The miko was looking at me expectedly. &quot;Well, we are here to 
have some fun, right? So why don&#39;t we find something to enjoy then?&quot;
	I stared down where the young woman&#39;s hand had touched mine and 
then back up again. A smile spread out over my lips seeing that the 
stress of the last days seemed to have completely evaporated now and 
left someone who wanted to just enjoy a pleasant night out since she 
was here already.
	&quot;That sounds neat,&quot; I replied and on a sudden impulse linked the 
fingers of my hand through hers, starting to move with a giggle and 
pulling the older woman along. Apparently we had just started to bond 
on a more personal level when the hectic work atmosphere at the Jinja 
had allowed. I was really glad and surely excited about it.

******************************

(Rei)
Contrary to common belief, I wasn&#39;t one to despise and outright refuse 
personal enjoyment. Why, the mere thought was ridiculous if you just 
took a look at my chosen path in life, the faith I had followed for 
well over a decade of my life. Shinto might be a religion of 
humbleness and reverence to a great degree but being the religion of 
life I was more than aware that prohibiting oneself it&#39;s simple joys 
and pleasures was a foolish thing to do. My faith had taught me to be 
well-mannered and collected as befitting of one of my station. I was 
by far not so closed off though that I could not enjoy a simple night 
out on a festival.
	In fact, ever since I had met my friends and comrades I had 
become considerably more outgoing. Before that I rarely had any 
motivation. Acquaintances at school had mostly been just that, only a 
few coming close to the term of friend, yet never quite reaching it. I 
had been alone most of my childhood, ever since mother passed away. 
But Usagi and the others had changed that, making me realize just how 
much I had actually longed to have people by my side who understood 
me. Kindred spirits, I used to call them. Sharing a similar burden, a 
similar destiny.
	So, no, the kami forbid, I was definitely not prone to enjoying 
myself. Tonight I simply hadn&#39;t been in the mood. Or I hadn&#39;t been 
until just about a short while ago. I had managed to avoid the others 
on my birthday mostly for the first two years. But starting with my 
sixteen birthday they had been rather persistent and wouldn&#39;t let me 
get away with any kind of excuse I would think up. It was a nice 
change from the repetitive and mood-dampening routine of meeting my 
father who could care less about what kind of life I lived. Family had 
stopped to matter to him when I was still very young and yet I had 
somehow clung to those short moments I had with him every year... 
until I found out what it was like to have someone REALLY care about 
your birthday.
	I had known that the other&#39;s would most likely not step by. With 
High School done, a new chapter of our life had just been opened. Many 
of us had applied for university, college or some kind of job, eating 
away practically all of our free time. I wasn&#39;t the only one with the 
problem. Planning and throwing birthday parties was out of the 
question right now since we all had to get used to the aspects in our 
life... after all that was what Usagi had insisted on, right? To live 
our lives as long as it was still possible. In about two years, if 
nothing drastically happened, there would be Crystal Tokyo. If not now 
to enjoy and fortify our dreams and hopes when then? The others had 
phoned earlier and wished me well but that was all, they were all far 
too busy at the moment. That was okay, I had spent enough birthdays on 
my own and not caring much about it as it was... I could deal.
	Or so I had thought.
	I smiled in irritated but somewhat fond acceptance of the 
blue-haired girl&#39;s success while she pulled me along without much 
resistance from my side. It reminded me somewhat on the first time 
Usagi had dragged Ami, Makoto and myself to a similar event, eager to 
spend time with her new friends. The joyful, carefree attitude of our 
princess was always positively infatuating. Who could resist someone 
like that, much more deny them the simple enjoyment of life?
	Sasami was just like Usagi. Well, not quite. There was a 
somewhat more... somber aura around her. Something less 
extra-exuberant but slightly more reserved. Where Usagi only rarely 
applied her reborn heritage, I had often caught Sasami in deep 
thought, in obvious reflection, during the days she had spent here. 
She could get rather absorbed in what seemed to be troubling, 
melancholic memories. And the next moment she would be a bundle of 
energy again, eager to please and ready to literally spread joy all 
around the Jinja grounds... Many visitors had commented - and no less 
complimented - to me about that.
	As hard as I tried to be objective, telling myself that I had 
granted the girl temporary shelter, that there was a good chance that 
someone would come looking for her, as hard as I tried to keep a 
moderate distance because of the mysteries surrounding her, it was 
close to impossible to not warm up to the joyful presence that had 
taken temporary residence within my home.
	And really, would it be so terrible to allow a friendship to 
form? No surely not. I could not detect any signs of malevolence and 
surely Sasami was not capable of bringing any harm to anyone. That 
seemed to be totally contrary to the girl&#39;s very nature. No friendship 
would certainly be nice. While you would hardly hear me admit it out 
loud, Usagi had done my lonely heart a whole lot of good. I had seen 
that there were different and successful ways to approach life, that 
not all were as bland as mine. No, this really wasn&#39;t the problem.
	It was the nagging fear that the bonds between my new assistant 
and I that I could already detect starting to form, would deepen far 
beyond simple friendship. I was no fool. I knew what the feelings were 
stirring in my heart whenever Sasami and I interacted. However, I also 
knew that with my history in the field, the possibility should better 
be averted at all costs...
	Looking back at the younger girl, happily glancing left and 
right to take in all the sights, just like a child on their first time 
on a fair, I had the sinking feeling that controlling just how far I 
allowed my association with Masaki Sasami to go was hardly in my hands 
alone anymore. She already had a habit to pass by all of my defenses 
without even as much as noticing.
	It seemed that fate was intending for us to become closer. The 
initial meeting had surely been fated, that much I was assured of. If 
this was divine will, what else could I do short of throwing her right 
out of my life and house - which I doubted was even possible at this 
point - to prevent... whatever was supposed to happen from happening? 
Nothing probably.
	&#39;Maybe I am simply interpreting too much into this. All the girl 
seems to want is friendship,&#39; I reasoned, pushing away these deep 
thoughts that similarly excited as much as they scared me. There was 
no point in pondering about things that couldn&#39;t be changed. Besides, 
my companion was getting agitated and impatient with her having to 
drag me along.
	Well, she wasn&#39;t dragging me anymore. I looked up and saw that 
Sasami had stopped to stare at a booth or more like one of the prizes 
on display. Without needing to really look, I could tell her eyes were 
glued on the brown toy cat. It was of small size with a lithe form and 
the black eyes sparkled slightly under the glow of a moonbeam falling 
on it at just the right angle. &quot;Oh, how pretty,&quot; Sasami squealed with 
delight, making me smile at yet another display of the simple-minded 
and inspiring innocence, displayed by my younger charge. Then Sasami 
turned to look at me with pleading eyes and I knew at once that 
refusing whatever wish would come from her lips, was strictly out of 
the question. &quot;I&#39;d really like to have the kitty, Hino-san.&quot;
	Thought as much.
	Making as if contemplating for a moment, I finally shrugged. 
&quot;Well, I&#39;ve been neglecting my archery training as of late. I might as 
well test my skill.&quot; Sasami broke out into a broad smile and I leaned 
forward to playfully tap her on the nose. &quot;You have to do one thing 
though.&quot;
	The blue-haired girl nodded rapidly. &quot;Sure. Everything.&quot;
	Faking dead-seriousness but my voice teasing, I replied, &quot;Stop 
calling me Hino-san, it makes me feel so old.&quot; Which it did, 
regardless of the clear age difference. It felt like yesterday 
sometimes that I had been around her age. &quot;Rei will do.&quot;

******************************

(Sasami)
It was early in the morning at the Hikawa Jinja. A Sunday to be 
precise. Normally most people would sleep in on Sundays, glad to not 
needing to rise early for school or work. They would lie in bed until 
the sun was well risen and then would indulge into a languid breakfast 
with family and/or loved ones while beginning the day at a slow place, 
recovering from the last week and refreshing for the next. That would 
especially hold true if the evening before was spent on an outing, 
going well close to midnight.
	The sun had barely showed the first signs of rising when I was 
already more or less fully awake, staring at the ceiling in the small 
but adequate room Rei had granted me. It was certainly a nice touch 
that even some of the guestrooms had real beds instead of having to 
get along with the temporary solution of the traditional futon. I 
wouldn&#39;t have minded, of course, but this was still certainly nice and 
showed once more to me what I had estimated almost upon our first 
meeting, that Hino Rei was essentially a very nice, caring person once 
you got her trust and past her seemingly aloof outward projection.
	I had been awake for awhile, dimly aware that I would have to 
get up soon. Where others would rather stay in bed on Sundays, living 
and working at a shrine was different, I&#39;ve learned that very fast. It 
wasn&#39;t all that different from what I had done back at the Masaki 
home. While I had very rarely aided my older brother - I tended to 
think of him more by his real identity as of late -, I had my fair 
share of chores around the house which I always took very seriously... 
compared to other cohabitants. This wasn&#39;t much different. The nature 
of some of my obligations here was, but that was all.
	Auntie Funaho had always said I was a fast learner and she had 
actually taught me a thing or to about the religion her son practiced. 
It was certainly different from what was practiced today. A more 
ancient, maybe even closer to the core way of faith. I had been 
interested, especially with my growing connection to Tsunami. I had 
hoped some sort of spiritual guidance would help me to adjust better 
to the advancing assimilation and in a way it actually did. I saw and 
understood many things in a different way now and was able to actually 
recognize some of the abilities now at my... at our disposal. Auntie 
Funaho had probably been the only one who could claim to at least 
begin to understand just what I was going through...
	I closed off the imaginary floodgate to past memories before it 
could fully open and rather concentrated on some more happier ones. 
Looking of the side there was the adoring little stuffed animal, the 
brown kitty. Despite no closer resemblance othr than fur and eye 
color, it had immediately reminded me of Ryo-oh-ki, the closest friend 
I could ever say having in my rather short childhood. From everyone, I 
missed the little cabbit the most. I had been tempted to take her 
along but I couldn&#39;t do that to her and Ryoko. Besides the latter and 
Washu would know where I was within a moment if I had did this. And 
surely they would try to get me, not understanding my and Tsunami&#39;s 
reasoning. It was better this way.
	The sorrow over the family and friends left behind on Jurai 
diminished considerably, comfortingly overshadowed by last night&#39;s 
events. The fun I... we had at the fair and the one who had granted me 
the cat as a gift. It was about the closest we had come to a casual 
display of friendship since meeting. It had always been a little 
awkward between us, the immediate connection that no doubt both of us 
felt, leaving us confused. That is why I treasured the toy already. I 
liked Rei a lot. Without really knowing her much, I knew that I wanted 
to be friends with her, and getting to see the more carefree side 
yesterday only reaffirmed my resolve on the matter. It didn&#39;t much 
matter to me that there was a physical difference of about six years 
in our age - not to even speak about the actual difference. I almost 
always had older people to call loved ones. Being a princess, it was 
tough to find someone around your age to play and grow up with. Maybe 
that was why I sought to not be alone anymore now that I was older. 
And Rei would make a very good... &#39;friend&#39;. I was assured of that.
	It was about time I got ready to start breakfast. I had easily 
noted that than it came to the Jinja, my hostess was a very dedicated 
person, keeping a strict schedule for herself and those she allowed to 
help - not that I had anyone to compare with than me. She loved this 
place dearly and I was more than willing to do my share to help her 
with its continuing prosperity. Not just because I wanted to score 
points with the raven-haired miko but also because she had so 
graciously offered me a place to stay, practically with no knowledge 
of who I was or where I came from, my necessary secrecy not helping 
much either.
	Besides, Hikawa Jinja was no ordinary shrine. Maybe to the 
normal eye it was nothing more than that, even to most 
spiritual-gifted it would appear as nothing more than a sanctuary of 
the divine. But for me the potency of the area and its binding into a 
close node of the magical nexus net that spammed all of Japan - but 
mostly so Tokyo - was a glaring, obvious fact. Tsunami believed that 
the place with a couple of others around the city formed a rather 
unusual high-level ley line pattern that seemed to guard and feed a 
certain point in its center that was as of yet asleep and waiting for 
the awakening of its purpose.
	Tsunami had been rather quiet and thoughtful than explaining 
that to me. Actually the signals I was getting from my other half were 
giving reasons for concern. Whatever she had learned from Martel, it 
was troubling her deeply. I was pretty sure I had to confront her 
about that soon since she was still blocking off those memories and 
more concrete feelings connected to them. Sometimes the spirit&#39;s 
overprotection left the boundaries of touching and became pretty 
annoying.
	Not wanting to make me worry was all fine and good and I was 
more than willing to acknowledge her privacy as she did mine but we 
were too close now. I wasn&#39;t the eight year-old anymore who had been 
afraid of what Tsunami had done to her. We shared almost everything 
already and just getting the feedback without any idea of what was 
going on inside her was not helping much. In fact, it left me feeling 
helpless, inadequate to share the burden of the other as we usually 
did. I was aware that Tsunami felt guilty about cutting my childhood 
as short as it had been regardless of the fact that I had assured her 
she was not to blame. Without her, I wouldn&#39;t have had a childhood to 
begin with. That guilt often manifested in touching but widely 
unnecessary displays of consideration.
	While occupied with these thoughts, well aware that Tsunami was 
probably listening, I had already finished dressing and slipped out of 
the room. While making my way to the bathroom I stopped at the door to 
the kind old priest&#39;s quarter, Rei&#39;s grandfather, and briefly peeked 
inside to assure myself that he was still sound asleep. The unhealthy 
paleness had lessened considerably. He was still weak and the virus no 
close to letting go but it didn&#39;t look so... lethal anymore.
	Quietly I shut the door again and leaning against it for a 
moment, allowed myself a smile. The older man was actually very kind. 
He cared a lot about his granddaughter, seeing her upbringing as a 
very personal quest. He hadn&#39;t let me know much about the rest of 
Rei&#39;s family, like her parents, but I was tactful enough not to ask 
and perceptive enough to realize it was obviously a touchy subject, 
most likely one evoking negative emotions. It had been his idea to ask 
Rei to go to the fair actually, not that I hadn&#39;t thought about it. 
The older man had noticed his granddaughter&#39;s stress and with a wink 
had told me that she was too stubborn to do something about it 
herself. But with a little prodding...
	Well, it had worked out well, and hopefully Rei would be in 
better spirits today. Well, if she was not, there was certainly a way 
to give it a little extra push. With that I set of to prepare for the 
morning. Most importantly, breakfast.

******************************

I admit to having an insatiable curiosity that had gotten me into more 
than one... uncomfortable situation. Like that fateful day when I had 
sneaked out to visit the Tree Chamber which had irreversible let to 
events that defined my near and distant future. That was probably the 
most drastic of cases. There were smaller ones, especially when I was 
very young. I always wanted to know stuff. About the stars, about this 
book and that machine and well, you get the point. The incident with 
Tsunami had dampened this curiosity streak somewhat and through the 
years Tsunami&#39;s calmer and more serious personality - especially that 
of her human aspect - helped to balance out my natural curiosity. 
However, it never fully eliminated it. Not that I wanted it too, but 
sometimes I wished it could.
	In the back of my mind all that played when I looked around the 
room, in search of something to satisfy my interest. I knew I probably 
shouldn&#39;t do this but couldn&#39;t help myself. It had been a couple of 
days since the fair and Rei was out to attend college, leaving me 
alone with her grandfather. While I searched around the room for 
anything remotely helpful, I always had to think back to the 
conversation we had over breakfast on Sunday. It had just been a 
casual question, actual a pretty logical one from my perspective. I 
had wondered about it before but never really got the chance to ask.
	The dark and sad expression I had briefly saw flash over Rei&#39;s 
face had startled me and the fast evasion tactic employed, told me 
enough to let the subject drop. I had considered asking her 
grandfather but since I had no idea what his feelings on the matter 
were, I was mindful of his physical state and rather set out to 
explore on myself.
	*She&#39;s not going to like you rummage about her room, you know?*
	I had to admit, Tsunami had a point. Whatever Rei&#39;s problem here 
was, I should probably not go about finding it out behind her back. 
Unfortunately, I was growing rather attached to the young woman. We 
were starting to connect better and I really didn&#39;t like to see a good 
friend so upset about something.
	&quot;She looked so... hurt. I just want to help,&quot; I reasoned, 
debating with myself - in more than the obvious sense of the word. 
Regardless of my reasoning, if Rei ever got wind of what I was doing, 
the reactions could vary from mild annoyance to all but destroying the 
tentative bond forming between us... The mere thought of the latter 
sent shudders down my spine.
	Shaking my head in defeat, I started to relent to my other 
half&#39;s superior experience. &quot;You are right though, I...&quot; That is when 
I spotted something that drew my immediate attention. Buried deep in 
one of the drawers there was a frame of some sorts. Against better 
reason, I pulled it out tentatively, noticing that it was indeed what 
I had suspected. A picture frame. The photo inside showed a seemingly 
happy family on first glance. A good-looking young man in a business 
suit, his beautiful wife, bearing a striking resemblance to Rei and a 
young girl. No more than three or four at best with the same dark, 
long hair as her apparent mother. Closer examination, applying the 
skills of observation I had acquired over the years, made me aware of 
some small things that were out of place though. The mother looked 
rather pale... and quite clearly sick. In spite of that the assumed 
husband appeared rather... cold and indifferent while young Rei - or 
so I assumed - seemed to be sad, sadder than a child her age should...
	&quot;That&#39;s the only one I have about all of us together.&quot;
	I had a hard time resisting the urge to jump straight through 
the ceiling. Actually I all but wanted to at the startling voice which 
bore a tone of underlying... anger that made me wish I could really 
just vanish from the spot. Turning around to glance at Rei standing in 
the doorframe with an unreadable, cool expression on her face. Her 
eyes spoke of the same deep pain I had seen before when asking her 
about her parents and it was unmistakable that Rei was in no way happy 
to see me here, with the picture clutched in one hand.
	&#39;Stupid curiosity...&#39;
	For a moment, time seemed to stand still or at least gradually 
slow down, freezing us in our individual positions. And the more 
seconds elapsed, the more uncomfortable I became. I knew I probably 
should say something but words were hard to come by at the moment. 
Tsunami was unusually silent too, but that I knew already. She&#39;d 
usually let me handle my own problems, not wanting to patronize me all 
the time. Something about learning to handle situations like these by 
myself. I would have given a lot for her usual insight but... It&#39;s not 
like she didn&#39;t warn me, right?
	&quot;You are back early,&quot; I said rather lamely, feeling like a dumb 
idiot the moment the words came out.
	&quot;I am,&quot; Rei answered curtly, not going further into detail. 
Outwardly Rei seemed to be indifferent but I could tell that was 
certainly not how she was really feeling. The intense purple eyes 
focused on me were unnerving and I shifted slightly. I really wished I 
hadn&#39;t let my curiosity get the better of me. It really would not pay 
out and would certainly impact on whatever form of friendship had 
formed between us. Rei was quick to invoke a royal temper that could 
rival my older sister&#39;s but she was usually just as fast to forgive as 
well. I wasn&#39;t too sure about the latter in this case though...
	&quot;Your... mother was very beautiful,&quot; I stated softly, glancing 
back at the picture, not sure what else to say. It was the truth 
though. The young woman in the picture was a very beautiful one, even 
by Jurai standards. In fact, the way she held herself despite her 
apparent sickness reminded me of the way Auntie Funaho would.
	Rei didn&#39;t say anything right away. Instead the raven-haired 
woman pushed away from the doorframe and stepped closer. I relented my 
grip on the frame immediately when she reached for it. My host looked 
at it, a ghostly thin smile, still rather sad though. &quot;Hai,&quot; she 
murmured before putting it back into the drawer and shutting it with a 
bit more force than necessary. I flinched at the banging sound. The 
miko still didn&#39;t say a word that would express her tangible upset 
feelings and that silence made me feel even worse than any angry rant 
could have made me. By now I had expected an outburst of temper and 
was all too ready to offer my sincere apologies. There was nothing to 
argue about anyway. I might have had good interests in mind but I 
probably should have gone about this differently.
	&quot;Rei...&quot; I started but never got any further than that.
	Without directly looking at me, staring at the spot where her 
hand still lingered on the closed drawer, Rei stated in a cold voice 
that made me feel like the lowest dirt on the planet at the moment, &quot;I 
believe you have chores to do, other than looking through my stuff 
that is.&quot;
	I felt a little numb at the cold indifference in the voice. I 
had known that her family was obviously a sore topic but had not 
expected it to strike this deep a chord. Her aura was one of barely 
restraint anger but also a great amount of disappointment, 
overshadowing a myriad of repressed emotions that I couldn&#39;t quite 
make out but were obviously making the older girl very uncomfortable.
	Feeling a need to at least try to explain, I started to say 
something but when Rei finally looked at me with a look swaying 
between disappointment and betrayal, I wisely glanced away, shuffling 
out of the room, feeling very, very bad about the entire incident. I 
might as well have destroyed the sliver of trust that had formed 
between us.
	&quot;I&#39;m...&quot; I choked down a hoarse sob, tears forming in my eyes. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; And with that I all but fled the room, ready to lose 
myself in mundane chores. Who knows, maybe it was the last time I 
could...

******************************

(Rei)
The atmosphere at the Jinja that evening was... morose. The tension in 
the air was tangible and reached as far as grandfather&#39;s room. The 
older man had actually given me a meaningful, somewhat stern look that 
made me feel rather guilty in spite of still feeling angry. Right now 
most of the anger had drained out and what was left was a sullen mood 
that had crept from my heart into my mind, refusing to budge.
	Stupid temper of mine.
	I had been in a rather bad mood already when I returned home 
early. One of the few classes I had actually time to attend had been 
cancelled, making the entire trip to the college more or less 
pointless. Seeing as I already was making enough sacrifices in the 
educational field, trying to balance it out with keeping the Jinja 
running despite grandfather&#39;s illness, I believe I was rightfully 
upset about the short notice.
	The other thing that had me thinking all morning was a call I 
had gotten earlier. Somehow, some of the visitors to the shrine had 
obviously gotten wind that Sasami&#39;s stay here wasn&#39;t quite... how to 
put it... legal. I DID check for her background or possible origin, 
alright, but would have to admit that my efforts had been less than 
enthusiastic lately. I had gotten used to the blue-haired girl&#39;s 
presence. After the fair this weekend things had become much more 
relaxed between us and I found it hard not to believe her when she 
said her presence wouldn&#39;t be missed at home. Her presence definitely 
would be missed here.
	The episode from earlier in the evening was a hard to ignore 
proof. Without even really noticing, Sasami had filled this sanctuary 
that had always had a somewhat lonely feel with a vivid atmosphere 
only felt before when the others had been visiting, mainly Usagi.
	Dinner had been just as splendid but the mood was impacting on 
its taste nonetheless. No word had been spoken. About two weeks 
before, that would have been the norm. Relative silence during the 
meals. Grandfather wasn&#39;t all that chipper and with his recent 
sickness, silence had become a product of lacking company. I was 
astonished at how much had changed in the two weeks since Sasami was 
here. Her gentle, cheerful spirit had given the whole place a new 
feel. And now that it was so clearly gone, it felt somehow... not 
right.
	I shook my head in irritation, once again - as so often during 
the past two weeks - about the effect the younger girl had not only on 
her surroundings but especially on me. I was pretty sure she wasn&#39;t 
even totally aware of that effect. There was just that certain charm, 
that mixture of cheerfulness and sometimes almost adult-like maturity. 
You could just not be angry with her. Which the current situation 
proved very much since I was feeling guilty for my earlier... 
outburst.
	It hadn&#39;t even been as much as that. In retro perspective my 
reaction was far harsher than a regular flare of temper would have 
been. On the one hand I believed to have had every right to be angry. 
After all Sasami had clearly violated my privacy and pried into 
matters that really shouldn&#39;t be relevant to her and which I didn&#39;t 
want to be reminded of. On the other hand, I wasn&#39;t much better 
actually. Making inquiries behind her back. True, they were probably 
more justified, after all there was still the suspicion that the girl 
was a runaway. But even that didn&#39;t lessen the feelings of guilt... 
Sasami had been very helpful, both around the shrine and to liven up 
the mood of the entire place, and I could still not even form the 
thought that she had any kind of... malevolent intentions.
	Sighing, I moved to push open the doors to the walkway outside. 
I had been standing behind it for some time now, knowing that Sasami 
was sitting outside with no apparent intention to come inside anytime 
soon. A circumstance further gnawing on my guilty mind. I was amazed 
at myself that by now I was ready to forgive and forget. But as I 
said, it was hard, or better even, near to impossible to stay angry at 
my new assistant.
	Without a word I closed the door behind me and proceeded to sit 
down next to her, feet dangling from the wooden floor. It kind of 
reminded me of that first meeting about two weeks ago and I couldn&#39;t 
help but reminisce about how much I had grown fond of the girl I had 
believed to be just another nuisance to add in my stressful life these 
days. How wrong I had been. The kami must have heard me that fateful 
morning, because Sasami seemed to be very eager to please and to share 
my burdens as I had wished for. I could hardly deny any more that 
after the night spent at the fair we had been well on the way to 
actual friendship.
	&quot;Gomen nasei...&quot;
	The apology slipped from our lips pretty much in flawless 
synchrony. Sasami lifted her head where it had been buried in her arms 
before, just as I looked back in startled amazement. There was that 
stereotypical gust of air that blew by - and yes, that actually 
happened - and then I couldn&#39;t help the first faint but quickly 
strengthening smile that was in turn answered by a first shy and then 
more and more radiant one by my companion. Finally we let go of the 
stored tension and broke out into a wave of giggles that lasted for 
several long, good and liberating seconds. I couldn&#39;t quite recall 
when I had laughed like this the last time but it surely had been a 
long while ago. Not even Usagi got me to do that often. Not that I 
didn&#39;t enjoy a good inspiriting humor but I never had felt the real 
need, the real reason to do so.
	After we had calmed down somewhat, silence once again claimed a 
prime position but unlike before it was completely vacant of the 
tension that had been between us since the earlier incident. I was 
saved from a repeat of the first attempt to start a conversation when 
Sasami was a wee bit faster this time. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have done that, 
Rei-oneesama,&quot; the younger girl started, using a bit more formal 
suffix than the playful &quot;-chan&quot; that I had come to like, especially 
coming from her. Right now, the blue-haired girl appeared rather 
humble. A trait I had observed quite often. It had something of 
royalty but also a certain... divinity. I knew that would sounded 
stupid to anyone else, however, that was what my senses were telling 
me. And then there was the other presence I had felt more than once 
now. Sometimes separated, often mingled with Sasami&#39;s own. &quot;I was 
curious because you looked so sad the other day when I asked you 
about...&quot; She trailed off, the end of the sentence still unmistakable.
	I said nothing for a moment, then heaved another sigh, shaking 
my head slightly. &quot;And I shouldn&#39;t have reacted like that. I should 
have known by now you only mean well.&quot; The smiles came more natural 
and more genuine around Sasami, and now was no exception. &quot;So, we both 
know now what we shouldn&#39;t have done. Maybe we should just forget the 
entire thing happened to begin with?&quot; I offered with a casualty that 
once more served to surprise me. It really shouldn&#39;t anymore. I 
wouldn&#39;t get rid of the positive presence of Sasami anytime soon. I 
didn&#39;t even want to.
	The younger girl&#39;s eyes lit up. &quot;Really?&quot;
	I chuckled at the wonder and eagerness to do just that. &quot;Sure,&quot; 
I replied.
	We both smiled at each other and continued to sit there in the 
cool night air. The weather had been pretty irregular. While typical 
for April, there had been a more steady increase in fluctuation the 
last years that worried me somewhat. I wasn&#39;t sure just what exactly 
to do about the other girl. But I surely did not want her presence 
gone from the Jinja, the positive element that would be removed, was 
too great a sacrifice in my opinion. And the ease with which this 
first minor fallout had been handled, was demonstrating once more that 
I would probably lose a possible good friend...
	Or more.
	I would have to call Ami about... arranging some stuff.

******************************

(Sasami)
Silence was quite an interesting thing if you took the time to study 
it. There were various degrees of it. Mainly those that gnawed on your 
nerves, making you jumpy and REALLY uneasy and those that were 
actually comfortable, an acknowledgement of peace and tranquility in 
one particular situation. Silence could be both a product of lacking 
company or ensuing between two or more parties.
	I could safely say I knew a lot about silence. Often enough of 
the uncomfortable, lonely sort. I could list numerous such instances 
and they had all left lasting impressions in my heart. The entire time 
period where I did not understand Tsunami&#39;s gift properly, or that one 
time when Tenchi had pretty much died in the attempt of rescuing Ryoko 
from Kagato. I had felt it, literally so, and I did not wish to relive 
the experience anytime soon, or ever if it could be helped. I never 
liked to be lonely, I never liked the deafening silence that came with 
the void of any other living presence. That is why I usually tried to 
always immerse myself within friends and family, feeling all that much 
more at ease in the presence of others whose light shone with the 
vibrancy of life, keeping the darkness away from themselves and those 
around them in the process.
	Yes, I knew about silence... and this one was one of the more 
enjoyable ones that I had encountered so far. Sitting side by side 
here with Rei, outside on the wooden porch in the cool night air, yet 
the temperature not really touching me. That had been different just a 
few minutes ago when my inner self was in full agreement with the 
physical outsides effect the occasional rather biting wind for this 
time of year had on me. However, it had just taken a couple of words 
exchanged, preceding that a heartily exchange of genuine amusement, in 
order to placate the negative effect my foolish actions from earlier 
had had on the tentative relationship - entirely platonic... so far - 
that had formed between the older miko and myself.
	I was feeling gratifying relief at the easy forgiveness earned 
by the raven-haired miko. In my opinion, her anger was quite 
justified. What I had done was stupid, disregarding her privacy and 
intruding on a matter obviously dragging up past memories that didn&#39;t 
want to be dragged up to begin with. I could have handled that much 
better. It was in these moments that I became very aware how much of 
life&#39;s lessons I had missed. My childhood drastically cut short I had 
been forced to grow up much faster. While physically that had been an 
unavoidable side effect, especially as of late, the mental side was a 
totally different matter. Maybe I had access now to most of Tsunami&#39;s 
memories and knowledge but even her human aspect had barely lived past 
the dawn of adulthood before becoming what she was today, and her 
elemental side was of a totally different nature to provide sufficient 
parallels.
	Combined it ought to be enough, yet that missing gap that was 
still between us and always would be until our full assimilation, 
often was enough to ensue a lack of the complementation that we would 
have when fully joined. While a combination of many different origins, 
we were in no way perfect, even all of us put together. And I think 
Tsunami deliberately tried to let me learn my own lessons. I could 
understand that, even if I sometimes wished she would just give me a 
fair warning in advance.
	*I did.*
	True enough.
	I glanced sideways at Rei, sitting there rather relaxed 
actually, staring of into the night sky. I could only speculate what 
was on the older girl&#39;s mind. It was amazing just how easily that 
crisis had been averted. All evening I had felt like I had just 
destroyed the tentative bonds forming between us. In a way, I should 
have known better. There was something far more... potent that tied us 
together - I actually had a pretty good idea by now what - and 
besides, Hino Rei was not someone to stay angry at someone for long. 
There was a gentle spirit underneath of all the outward aloofness that 
most people saw and took for the norm. I should know, the evening at 
the fair had given me a pretty good glimpse, as much as the days 
afterwards. I hardly believed the miko was so cheap as to make 
judgment because of one incident.
	I had learned my lesson but regardless of that, I still 
remembered the reaction and the underlying pain in Rei&#39;s eyes earlier. 
Submerged in my misery, I had spent most of my time piercing together 
the few clues into a greater picture. And yet they still left some 
questions open. I wouldn&#39;t press though. There was something else I 
could do, which hopefully would earn me some trust and openness in 
response. Not that I wanted to drag up painful memories but the 
reaction from the incident today had only firmed my resolve that I 
should do something for my host. I just couldn&#39;t stand by, seeing 
people distressed like this. Especially if it involved family. I had 
my own experiences there.
	&quot;Otousan is into politics too,&quot; I said quietly, nonetheless 
disrupting the silence and making Rei look at me in evident surprise. 
It pretty much confirmed my superficial theory. &quot;I&#39;ve been raised into 
this world... but I never particularly cared. I neither loved nor 
hated it... but I never quite liked what it did to Otousan... or so 
many others I know. &#39;Politics&#39; can be a pretty harsh world. And it can 
change people, whether they want to or not.&quot;
	It wasn&#39;t like I was lying. This was what it was like and right 
now it was rather irrelevant that I was talking about the greatest 
star-spanning empire this galaxy knew, or that my father was the 
Emperor himself... No, that didn&#39;t really matter and it was not the 
time to reveal this to the miko. Someday, maybe someday soon. I didn&#39;t 
like keeping secrets, not after the hurt it had cost me when I was too 
afraid to talk to my sister or extended family about Tsunami. But in 
this case, I herded my wiser counterpart&#39;s advise that it was better 
to wait for the moment.
	As I said, that didn&#39;t really matter. I&#39;ve seen and experienced 
firsthand what the exposure to the long debate over the succession 
after my parents mysterious disappearance about two years ago had done 
to our family unit. The wedges it had driven between us, the 
alienation that had taken place, the naked, carefully hidden and 
undeniable truths it had dragged up. It wasn&#39;t all the fault of those 
arrogant nobleman and noblewoman who had lost all perspective over the 
centuries and millennia... but it had certainly done its share.
	Rei had contemplated my words for a long time. &quot;Is that why you 
ran away?&quot; Her tone wasn&#39;t judging by any measure, maybe actually 
understanding, compassionate. Obviously the shift in tactics was 
meeting with success. I didn&#39;t expect any grand revelations right now. 
And I had deduced most of what I needed to know already. The rest 
could wait for another time, when Rei was in the mood. I certainly 
wasn&#39;t going to push her, I never wanted to. Right now, all I wanted, 
was to give her some indication that I understood part of her pain. 
Without sufficient details, I couldn&#39;t be sure just how similar or 
different our experiences were but I hoped by opening up a little, to 
gain back some of the trust that at the very least had been scarred 
today.
	&quot;That&#39;s one of the reasons,&quot; I said, seeing no need to deny the 
words of the miko. &quot;There is a lot more though...&quot; I trailed off, 
looking up into purple eyes gazing back and for a short, startling 
moment I felt magnetically drawn to them...
	Before Rei smiled pleasantly. I was so surprised, I could only 
stare down in wonder at the hand covering my own before slowly daring 
to look up again, seeing the same smile still there. &quot;Why don&#39;t you 
tell me about that some other time? I made it a principle of mine not 
to dwell in the past... or at least for not too long and today has 
been rough enough on us.&quot;
	With that she stood up and then extended her hand. &quot;Shall we?&quot; I 
was still caught unguarded by the sudden mood and topic shift. I had 
been pretty sure she&#39;d address me on my open admission but it seemed 
like Rei had totally dropped the matter. The helping hand was just a 
gesture but it meant so much more. It was as much an outright 
invitation as I had ever gotten after pretty much dropping into the 
young miko&#39;s life.
	With an answering smile that could have lit up the Imperial 
Palace back on Jurai, I took the offered hand and let myself be pulled 
up. It seemed the crisis was totally averted and by some miracle Rei 
had made the decision of wanting me to remain right there with her, 
regardless of my admission to, technically, having run away from home. 
I had believed to at least give some more explanations... but Rei had 
not even asked, regarding my reasons as unnecessary for the moment. It 
was almost as if she sensed my own reluctance, as if she knew 
instinctively that my reasons, whatever they were, could be trusted.
	I knew that very moment, just what exactly I had felt upon our 
first meeting. And the realization both surprised and elated me.

******************************

(Rei)
Sitting in the main sanctuary of the Jinja, the chamber of the Sacred 
Fire, I stared into the flames that had guided me for so long, trying 
hard... and mostly unsuccessful to achieve a calm state of mind. Not 
that I felt troubled or something, I just couldn&#39;t find the right 
focus tonight. And if I was honest with myself, I knew the reason for 
that quite well.
	Not a bad reason, mind you, not even coming close. Just a 
surprising one, a pleasant surprise. Not to mention quite a bit of 
confusion and mystery. Yes, I was thinking about Sasami again. She was 
out for the evening, said she had to &quot;take care of something&quot;. The 
younger girl had appeared rather... apprehensive and it didn&#39;t take a 
genius to get the importance of whatever she had to &quot;take care of&quot;. I 
hadn&#39;t made any fuss about it. In fact, I hadn&#39;t even thought about 
asking her for details. It wasn&#39;t like I was her mother or 
something...
	No, but I was, at least legally, her chaperone now, and with all 
the mysteries surrounding my young assistant I should by all means be 
at least a little more curious. Oh, I was curious, all right. But not 
to the point where I felt threatened by the unknown factors. There was 
just no hint of wariness or worry about consequences. I simply trusted 
Sasami to tell me her secrets on her own time...
	That was the most surprising realization I probably made in this 
last week. Instead of driving a wedge between us, the incident where 
Sasami had discovered the old photography that I kept carefully tugged 
away, we had actually gotten a lot closer. All hard feelings had been 
washed away in a mere instant and the following morning the event 
hadn&#39;t even been mentioned anymore. A part of me had wanted to stay 
angry, or at least sour at the younger girl. While I believed to have 
played my own part in the escalation of the situation, the fact 
remained that I should feel violated in my privacy.
	I didn&#39;t though. For some strange reason, it didn&#39;t bother me 
that the younger girl seemed interested about my past. There was just 
no way she could have anything other than good intentions for doing 
so. To prove that I had actually gone and told her about my father, 
Kaidou and the... neglect that had always been there since I was 
little. I had never felt the need to express my feelings on the matter 
like that to anyone, not even my fellow Senshi. I didn&#39;t look back 
into the past. That was my principle. However, as hard as I tried this 
would always come up once in awhile, reminding me of those unpleasant 
childhood memories.
	And with Sasami... I couldn&#39;t explain it, really, I couldn&#39;t. It 
felt... strangely comforting, relieving to talk to someone about it. 
Sure, if I had wanted to I could have gone to grandfather but I never 
felt the need to do that. It was in the past. There was nothing I 
could change about it now. And still, with the mysterious, young girl 
who had literally dropped right onto my life&#39;s doorstep, I was at 
ease. I could release the pent-up frustration and melancholy those 
painful memories stirred up and I knew they would be understood, they 
would be safe with her.
	It was yet another mystery about my new companion.
	By now, I felt no trouble in actually calling her friend. As I 
said, the incident had actually managed to bring us closer and I had 
learned some small things about her in return. A kindred spirit. A 
mixture of emotions was tied to the term. Usually that is how I saw my 
companions, my friends. However, I couldn&#39;t shake of the feeling that 
something far... deeper was there, connecting us. No, I already knew 
that. It was the nature of that connection that... scared me a little, 
but strangely enough excited me. While I tried hard to suppress the 
latter reaction, it was getting harder with each day and with each 
moment spent around the vivid, cheerful spirit filling the space of 
Hikawa Jinja these days.
	I missed her presence already, which might be one of the reasons 
for my lack of focus. The place seemed empty without her. Strange how 
that can happen after not even a month...
	I shook my head forcefully. I would not go through that again. I 
had come to a decision about this a long time ago. This kind of 
commitment was not for me. It would just end up hurting us both. I 
would not be so greedy. The friendship that had formed between us was 
already precious to me. If I wanted more, I knew it would be messed 
up, again. It was best to stay the way it was right now. Yes, that was 
for the best.
	Heaving a sigh at my inability to achieve a proper frame of my 
mind, my thoughts wandering too aimlessly, I got up from my position 
and stretched, relieving some of the tension that had resulted from 
minutes of lacking success to meditate. I actually had allowed myself 
to consider it again, did I not? Despite my unwillingness to do just 
that. Had I not vowed to myself to never make that mistake... But, 
that had been before I&#39;ve seen the relationship between Usagi and 
Mamoru develop and fare against all odds. The loneliness in me had 
longed for something like that. Still, a love like that, how often did 
this happen? What...
	I gritted my teeth in annoyance, realizing that I was losing 
myself once more in the familiar spiral. Even now, when Sasami wasn&#39;t 
around, she was affecting me in this way. Maybe I should put a bit 
more distance between us. The thought was as quickly discarded as it 
was produced. Maybe even faster. An idea simply impossible to accept. 
It wasn&#39;t like I could just sent her away for awhile. Not even was the 
thought unbearable, but also the fact remained that Sasami was now 
officially registered, as far as the authorities went, as part of this 
household and thus I was responsible for her. When Ami had called me 
back about the matter of the social worker that had announced a visit, 
I was as surprised as our resident genius had been at the news she had 
for me.
	I had been pissed enough that someone could harbor any ill 
intentions against the gentle blue-haired girl. She was friendly to 
anyone, any customer and visitor, be they ever so grumpy. That someone 
actually would spell trouble for her was beyond me and if I ever 
managed to track down the person who had involved the authorities in 
this... well, I wasn&#39;t sure what I would do but it surely wouldn&#39;t be 
pleasant. Furious as I was about that, I was unprepared for Ami 
telling me that she actually had found a file for one Masaki Sasami... 
A file that was as mysterious and non-saying as the girl herself.
	While adequate for the authorities, Ami had easily figured out 
that it was actually a very well faked one. It shouldn&#39;t have 
surprised me. The exact data was irrelevant. Mainly because I was 
pretty sure that birthplace, family etc. were made up. Ami concluded 
that it had obviously been made by someone who understood what they 
were doing, a bit sloppy at some points but enough to slip past the 
notice of a casual examination. Well, Sasami had told me that she came 
from a political family, so I shouldn&#39;t be surprised to find a fake ID 
and such stuff.
	It was disappointing though, since I had hoped to learn some 
more things about my new assistant. Ami had offered to look a bit more 
into the matter but I had declined, much to my own surprise. The 
incident had taught us both not to be too nosy. Sasami would tell me 
eventually. She had already began to open up after all, and I was 
confident enough in the girl&#39;s innocence to placate Ami&#39;s concerns.
	Rationalizing that I wouldn&#39;t get any meditation done today, I 
left the room, seeking some other form of occupation until Sasami got 
back. I had really gotten too used to her, I mused. &#39;Can&#39;t escape now, 
can you. Just have to go with the flow.&#39; It was hard to argue with 
those thoughts. Whatever fate had planned for Sasami and I, I doubted 
there was something I could do about it. That tiny, repressed and 
lonely part didn&#39;t want to. Not that I was anywhere near ready to 
admit that out loud...

******************************

(Sasami)
Once again I found myself in the kitchen during the early hours of the 
morning. Whistling a happy tune, I didn&#39;t need to pay much attention 
to what my hands were doing. The motions coming flawlessly together by 
years of training-developed instincts. There was nothing special about 
today&#39;s breakfast, allowing my thoughts to wander in different 
directions, rather than focusing on the preparations.
	And there was enough to think about. On the one hand what I had 
learned yesterday still spooked around my head and would probably 
always remain in the background with Tsunami being so concerned about 
it and I could only understand that concern too well. I had been eager 
to learn what had my other half so absent-minded and troubled most of 
the time. Of course, I had also been somewhat apprehensive when 
Tsunami finally relented and that apprehension had been well founded.
	At first, I had been rather awed at actually visiting Earth&#39;s 
Yggdrasil and was wondering at the course of action. Obviously Tsunami 
wanted to explain the situation to me rather than just letting me 
access her memories, thoughts and feelings. In a way I was grateful 
for that. The environment had been soothing to me, the many 
impressions of the vivid forest and the magnificent tree had managed 
to calm my mind. True, not that I hadn&#39;t seen a Life Tree before, I 
was in the process of assimilating with one, but there were some 
difference between Tsunami and most other Yggdrasil. This was the 
first time I had met one of the &#39;normal&#39; spirits in person. Martel was 
a kind woman, or so it seemed, and had greeted me rather warmly.
	However, that is where most of the pleasant memories ended. I 
had heard about the ancient seal, holding one of the most malevolent 
creatures captive that the galaxy, maybe the universe as a whole had 
ever seen. From Tsunami&#39;s memories I knew about the chaos and 
destruction this monster had wrought upon Earth hundreds of millennia 
ago, just as much as I knew about the effort and sacrifices it had 
taken to seal it away.
	No wonder Tsunami was worried. My mind still boggled at the idea 
that in just a few years time the ancient seal was weakened enough for 
the creature, known as Pandora to the people of those old times, to 
make a most likely successful attempt at escape. A shudder run down my 
spine, just thinking about the fear the human memories of Tsunami 
inspired. It was hard to believe. While still maintaining most of her 
humanity in spirit, the merge between her and her namesake tree self 
on Jurai had made her a lot less submissive to such emotions. Usually 
Tsunami had a calm, balanced nature, seldom swayed by extreme 
emotions. That had often been an anchor for me lately. Now the level 
of concern from my other half was far beyond normal levels and not 
helping at all to calm my own nerves.
	I couldn&#39;t debate what was worst though. The fact that something 
so gigantic it put even Tokimi to shame was about to assault not only 
Earth but most likely the rest of life as a whole, or that there was 
nothing that could be done about it. I admit, I did not understand all 
the details and factors. What I could relate to were only the glimpses 
of memory that I had from Tsunami. I understood though that the seal 
in itself was a delicate matter. Tempering with it was like trying to 
extinguish a fire by pouring oil over it. It left me feeling 
helpless... A sentiment shared all the way by my nominal counterpart.
	On the other hand there was the much more enjoyable. Returning 
home - a term that had become much more meaning as well - rather late, 
I had not expected to find anyone still up. But there had been Rei, 
sitting on the front porch, at such a late hour, patiently waiting. 
There hadn&#39;t been an inquiry about where I had been for so long. 
Instead all that I could detect was relief at my return, a reaction 
that warmed my heart considerably, chasing away the dark clouds that 
had clustered around my mind since the revelations of the two life 
tree dryads earlier. Rei had been unmistakably glad that I was back. 
Not so much because she had been worried, but more because... she 
missed my presence.
	At first I had thought I had misinterpreted it but thinking back 
on the last week and the steadily growing... affection between us. 
There was a genuine friendship now and Rei seemed to make no effort to 
deny it. Neither in front of strangers or her friends, who I had met 
briefly, their own time occupying them equally as much as Rei at the 
moment. Those that I met seemed to be very nice though. Especially the 
girl named Usagi. They were all reincarnated star children, or so 
Tsunami had deduced, but the blonde seemed to have actually caused an 
interesting reaction of nostalgic interest. Not that I had that much 
trouble seeing the similarities between her and Tsunami&#39;s sister. But 
that wasn&#39;t of much importance now.
	It had been a cause of much discussion between my other half and 
me, whether or not it would be wise to tell them eventually what lay 
in store for them. I felt like we should, I felt I should at least 
tell Rei... However, Tsunami had been surprisingly adamant about the 
matter. There was little to be done at this point and revealing our 
knowledge would only serve to throw their peaceful lives into 
disorder. Martel had obviously told her about what the Senshi of this 
age had gone through in recent years and I could sympathize that they 
deserved some quiet. Nonetheless...
	I sighed in defeat. I wouldn&#39;t win that argument with Tsunami. 
And she had been doing this for many, many millennia now. Sacrifices 
for the greater good, just like the current one of leaving Jurai 
behind. It pained her, I could tell, but usually she had always been 
right in the past. I had to simply trust her on this and that had been 
something I had learned to do in recent years.
	And so I rather concentrated on more pleasant memories. Like the 
growing relationship between Rei and myself. I had realized it that 
night, after the incident with the photo. I couldn&#39;t deny it anymore. 
The feeling was just like Tenchi and yet... far stronger in many ways.
	&quot;What are you going to do about this?&quot; My concentration didn&#39;t 
waver at the sudden, ghostly appearance but I spared Tsunami a glance. 
I had expected her to ask me about this situation. I was aware that it 
was somewhat complicated with having to consider our impending 
assimilation. Tsunami smiled, knowing my thoughts immediately. &quot;Not 
like that. Sasami-chan, you shouldn&#39;t be worried that I disapprove. 
First of all it is your life. And all decisions that we make 
individually will be absorbed into our final form. It was the same 
when I underwent this the first time. I might be less human right now 
but I still loved and still do love my sister and friends from that 
time. Nothing will be lost.&quot;
	I smiled shyly. &quot;I know that. I just keep feeling like I make 
decisions for us both this way.&quot; With a shrug I added eventually, &quot;Not 
that it matters right now. I won&#39;t rush into this. I&#39;m pretty sure 
about my feelings but Rei seems rather reluctant to admit anything 
beyond friendship. I&#39;m sure she must have felt something by now... 
It&#39;s no surprise though, considering what she went through.&quot; It pained 
me to think about what Rei told me about her experience with love, 
both from family and someone she considered... close. There was no 
telling what pushing the relationship onwards by force could result 
in. And I had learned my lesson with Tenchi anyway. Young and na&iuml;ve as 
I had been, I had wanted too much, too fast, and ended up influencing 
the outcome just as much as it had been predetermined. I wouldn&#39;t make 
that mistake again.
	There was enough time for this to grow. And eventually, just 
maybe I would find the place where I truly belonged to after all.
	*You have grown up a lot,* Tsunami said gently, her expression 
almost motherly.
	I giggled at that. &quot;Hai. It comes with the age.&quot; The tone was 
teasing, unlike the usual residential regret of growing up as fast as 
I had. It wasn&#39;t just to placate Tsunami&#39;s guilt though but at the 
moment, I did feel at ease about the circumstances. There was nothing 
to be changed about that anyway, and I had learned my own lessons 
through this, lessons that might as well help me now in pursuing 
something that could turn out to be quite... wonderful.

******************************

&lt;Higurashi Shrine, somewhere else in Tokyo (Sango)&gt;
The morning was a beautiful one, the sunrise casting the city in a 
magnificent myriad of colors. Even after spending over a year in this 
age, I found myself still mesmerized at the sheer magnitude of what 
was called the city of Tokyo. So unlike what I had known, what I had 
thought possible to begin with. The state of human evolution into an 
industrial and technological highly advanced age was hard to believe 
for one from some half millennia ago. To say that I had been impressed 
upon first setting foot into this era would be a gross understatement. 
Such a shame though that only recently I had begun to feel the need to 
actually learn about this age and all its wonders. The curiosity that 
had been clouded by listlessness caused by the ordeal which&#39;s memory I 
had been fleeing from.
	Lately I found myself often sitting here on the roof of the 
housing adjourned to the small shrine. The tranquility and peace of 
the morning helped to soothe my mind, taking it away from the dark 
places and the nightmares still haunting my sleep despite all the 
efforts of my companion. I couldn&#39;t discern if they became less or 
actually more in recent days. I would prefer to say the former but 
could not quite deny the latter either. Too much reminded me here of 
what I had both lost and endured in the long and brutal conflict waged 
in my home era with the Half-Youkai Naraku... and its eventual 
conclusion. A conclusion that was as much brutal as it was bloody, not 
to mention laced with sacrifices left and right that left us feeling 
none to happy after emerging the nominal &#39;victors&#39;. A war had no 
victors, only survivors.
	It was a good thing that we were leaving. Not that I wasn&#39;t 
grateful for the kindness with which Kagome&#39;s family had treated me, 
welcoming me into their midst like their own without hardly batting an 
eye. And to be fair, I was glad that I had been able to live with a 
family that had enough ties to the traditional rather than some of the 
modern age ones where I would have found it much more difficult to fit 
in.
	As it was, my training as a youkai taijiya had included enough 
spiritual practice that I found myself easily able to lend a hand to 
the kind if somewhat eccentric priest of the Higurashi Jinja. True, 
many things had changed over the course of the centuries, in both 
human evolution and the practice of religion. Some of that was quite 
mind-boggling to me. And yet I found Kagome&#39;s grandfather to be of a 
rather traditional, altruistic branch who more than welcomed and 
favored my insight of my own training.
	Then there were of course the other members of Kagome&#39;s family. 
Namely her mother, a woman who I had no trouble in drawing a 
resemblance to my companion in points of character. She was a very 
friendly sort that was easy to get along with. I had learned a great 
deal from her, not just helping around the house but also in more than 
a few private talks that aided me enormously in fitting in with is 
age&#39;s many facet.
	And little Souta... Well, just seeing him and Kagome interact 
reminded me of Kohaku and myself. Which in turn of served to make me 
fall into melancholy and depression. I cursed myself for that, knowing 
that I should rather be happy for them, but could hardly help it. How 
should I after all that happened after all? After the choice I had 
been forced to make. One love for another? One dear life for another? 
How could I not remember the untroubled times spent back at our 
village, where Kohaku and I had fooled around in similar displays of 
sibling rivalry and affection. It was still too painful to recall... 
and I wasn&#39;t sure if it would ever get better.
	Yes, it was surely best to leave. I had grown to like this place 
and almost felt like part of the family already but too many things 
here sparked memories of the kind I would rather have buried than 
remembered. For over a year now I had sought to come to terms with 
what had transpired in the final stages of the battle with Naraku. And 
while especially Kagome&#39;s patient caring had done much to quench the 
flames of shame, loss and revulsion, I was hardly close to salvation. 
I probably would never be. That which happened was a part of my life, 
an undeniable circumstance of my past which I would have to accept 
eventually and let go so that I could live once again, to start a new 
life from the ashes left behind. Yet, I could not really let go. Not 
when everything here constantly reminded me of what I had lost. What 
we had lost... because Kagome, I could tell that without asking, was 
just as affected as I was. The tree, the well... Marks and reminders 
of the age we had left behind, the sacrifices we had left behind still 
haunting us.
	A faint smile crept into my face as I spotted my companion, 
exiting the house below, with Kirara following close behind. She did 
not look around, instead turning around right away to glance up to my 
place on the roof, favoring me with one of her patent kind smiles that 
had many take a fast liking to her in my era. Many including myself. 
It was more strained nowadays. No doubt tainted by the same reasons I 
myself could not muster the will to be carefree and happy nowadays.
	With hardly any effort I stood up and casually jumped down to 
ground level, years of training permitting me such feats with ease. 
&quot;Good morning, Kagome-chan,&quot; I greeted and without waiting for a reply 
pulled her close in for a kiss that lasted well into several seconds 
and that made the appliance of the term &quot;good morning kiss&quot; appear 
horribly understated.
	&quot;Good morning, Sango-chan,&quot; Kagome replied when we finally 
parted, her breath somewhat hitched and her face just the tiniest bit 
flushed. She was used to it by now and hardly all so embarrassed as 
she had been at the beginning. Still, at times I could still manage to 
bring some coloring to her cheeks which was undeniable worth the 
effort. &quot;You were up early.&quot;
	Kagome&#39;s tone implied more than her words said. The dark-haired 
miko had clearly missed me upon waking. We had become so used to 
having the other close that we more or less depended on it. &quot;Gomen, I 
felt somewhat restless this morning.&quot;
	My lover inclined her head questioningly. &quot;Nervous?&quot;
	It was easy to fathom what she was asking about. After all I had 
just spent reflecting on the matter myself. &quot;Not really. I think a 
change will do us good. Not that I don&#39;t like it here, but...&quot;
	Before I could continue, Kagome had put a finger on my lips, 
effectively silencing me with that and a tender, understanding look. 
&quot;I know,&quot; was all she said and yet I could see so much more in brown 
eyes that held a wisdom far beyond that which should apply to someone 
of our age. No doubt the result of her final merging with Kikyou but 
also the weight of seeing the cruelties of life firsthand and much too 
soon for someone so young. I was aware that Kagome had pondered to 
have us move away right after our return but was torn in her decision. 
She no doubt saw the need to leave the past behind but didn&#39;t want to 
leave her family behind so soon.
	Now that she had finished with what they called Junior High 
School education - after repeating the year mostly spent in my era - 
we were now both more than ready to seek a different, a new path in 
life. I had to admit while the year spent here with Kagome&#39;s family 
had served to constantly remind of what we had left behind, it had 
also given me a sense of stability. I had been able to slowly get used 
to this time and age instead of rushing into things... In retro 
perspective that was probably a good thing.
	Kirara started to head inside. Wordlessly Kagome and I both 
turned to follow and finish our last preparations, hands linking 
together with the familiarity of over a year of constant and deep 
companionship, giving us both a sense of shelter in each other&#39;s 
presence.

******************************

&lt;Hikawa Jinja (Rei)&gt;
There was definitely an advantage having a cook in your household, 
even more so one whose skill level was on par with Makoto&#39;s, if not - 
and believe me I had not thought that was possible sometime ago - even 
exceeding it. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, you name it. Every time Sasami 
did her magic in the kitchen you were left very much sated and 
conflicted between either being thoroughly energize to tackle any 
tasks the day would confront you with, or reveling too much in the 
content feeling the meals were giving you. And magic it was indeed 
because how else could you describe those wonders of culinary 
deliciousness?
	I chuckled to myself at the odd ways my thoughts traveled this 
morning. Not that I would deny their logic. Far from it. In fact, 
going about the morning ritual of preparing for the day, I had just 
finished another such &quot;magic meal&quot; by my nominal assistant. And it 
would indeed be a day where I could use all of the energy her meals 
tended to supply. How exactly I had allowed myself to be talked into 
this was still beyond me but nonetheless here I was, ready to greet 
yet another addition to these grounds that had had a lone or at best a 
duo of caretakers for the last several decades.
	Oh, who was I fooling? It was Sasami&#39;s idea and by now I was 
fairly accustomed to the fact that even if I had sufficient arguments 
against them, I would usually yield to her suggestions. After all, the 
young girl had proven to be an enormous relief in many fields of my 
life. Her teaching in the Shinto faith was crude, sporting many 
unusual practices - which no less amended to be effective in the end - 
and could adept very quickly. Further more, her friendly, usual 
cheerful manner had - how to put that without sounding too 
exaggerating? - considerably boosted Hikawa&#39;s reputation. And that 
when I had thought Grandfather&#39;s illness would produce quite the 
opposite effect.
	I even had had more times to actually spent studying and at 
campus these last days, feeling more secure now that Sasami could 
handle herself. She seemed to pick up on base and advanced principles 
of my chosen faith that I had practiced and learned for years in the 
blink of an eye, quite literally. Sometimes I wondered if the younger 
girl was really somehow divinely guided or an angel in disguise. I 
would not totally dismiss the notion because her aura suggested at 
anything but ordinary.
	While I had never thought her to be... dangerous - a concept 
that seemed to go against the very nature of her existence as any 
amateur spiritualist could have perceived easily -, now even my 
earlier, base suspicions had all but evaporated. And as fast the speed 
with which our friendship was developing seemed, I was aware that I 
would miss her terribly if she were to be gone.
	Then again. I had felt the same after meeting my fellow 
comrades, the other Senshi, yet not too such an extent and such speed. 
This was a fateful encounter indeed, I was not blind to that. Just how 
fateful I was still wondering about...
	My mental reflections were brought to a halt upon discovering in 
dismay yet another testament that for all her possible divinity, 
Masaki Sasami had a weird sense of mischief, involving to play the 
occasional practical joke here and there. As it was, the traditional 
miko garb, the robes that would mark me as one of my current station, 
were gone... and I was pretty sure I would not find any of the spare 
ones in time. Instead of the traditional white and red what I found 
brought a smile of mixed affection and bemused irritation to my face.
	The robe was somewhere in cross a style between that of a miko 
and that of a priest - or priestess in this case, close to the 
intricate designs of a standard kimono while it had something more... 
royal. Even though I thought the term odd, it was the only one that 
seemed to fit. And not just because the color tone was off a royal 
blue, highlighted by the fiery red at collar and sleeves. There were 
curious designs all over it. Little white animals, bird-like, the 
closest resemblance being somewhere near an eagle, crossed with a 
butterfly... Actually, I was rather versed in ornithology and I could 
neither draw from that nor from my past life - who had encountered a 
considerable greater variety of species - any accurate determination 
of the kind of creature.
	It was probably not even meant to resemble anything. Just a 
design. I shook off the feeling that it meant something more. There 
was also another object I had spotted. The analogy to the hat of a 
priest was hard to mistake but actually the head garment was more like 
a laurel wreath, well without there being any laurel... as much as I 
could tell. It was of some kind of leaves or other natural material, I 
determined, having picked it up and running my fingers alongside the 
curious article. While not quite laurel, the term wreath could easily 
be applied as it would fit around the head of the owner quite nicely. 
The front could be easily made out as the material was woven into a 
triangular shape pointed downwards.
	All in all, this was rather beautiful and, as much as I tried 
not to be affected, efficiently touching. Now, I knew for a fact that 
Hikawa Jinja did not own this and had trouble thinking Sasami could 
have purchased it on her own. First because I had never seen a style 
quite so unique before and didn&#39;t believe it to be casually sold in 
the next clothes shop around the corner... and even if, the price 
would probably far exceed which the younger girl should have been able 
to afford. Which left only the option that this might be her own, in 
some manner... Yet another mystery to be added to my charming 
assistant.
	That was a thought to be pondered later though. Our guests would 
arrive soon and while I still wasn&#39;t quite certain of the younger 
girl&#39;s suggestion it did have some merit and I would at least reserve 
judgment whether or not the two girls, who would come as &quot;exchange 
mikos&quot; on recommendation by a priest from a another shrine that my 
grandfather knew quite well, would serve to be quite as potentially 
gifted as indicated and thus a further aid. The offer was made in the 
vague hopes that a change of climate would do the priest&#39;s 
granddaughter and one of her friends to some good, something new to 
leave behind what sounded like some tragedy in their recent past.
	A month ago, I would have declined. But having Sasami around had 
showed me that I could very well share my own dream with others and 
accept their aid. If anything, I owed Sasami and her efforts, that I 
was willing to at least see for myself who those Higurashi Kagome and 
her companion were.
	Grabbing a hold of the curious robes, I shrugged in defeat, 
knowing I had not the time to find anything else. And besides, this 
had been Sasami&#39;s idea to begin with. And so I slipped into the fine 
garments with a nonchalant, &quot;Well, let&#39;s humor her, shall we?&quot; that 
came from the experience of roughly one month spent around Sasami and 
the wisdom that came with it. The wisdom that going along with that 
little &quot;prank&quot; - though one could mistakes this instant more as a gift 
- was inevitable. Best to just show our potential additions just who 
they got themselves involved with.

******************************

(Sasami)
The climate had begun to stabilize over the last days. Unfortunately, 
I knew as much of the reasons as I knew that such chaotic temperature 
difference would be more frequent in the following months and years to 
come. The planet was reacting, in dismay and more than a certain 
amount of trepidation, to what would be coming, soon.
	I closed my eyes for a moment, applying one of the techniques I 
had learnt from Aunt Funaho, centering my thoughts on the here and now 
instead of dwelling on the past or in this case dreading the future. 
All too often I had found myself doing so. As much as I tried to be 
happy within the present, whenever I was alone or without sufficient 
distraction my thoughts tended to wander along darker paths, 
reflection and vision alike, all of which rarely being pleasant. In 
that aspect our assimilation proved none too helpful either. While our 
joining gave us a sense of eternal companionship, Tsunami herself had 
always been prone too worrying too much about events past and 
forthcoming. Other than her sister who would live every day with the 
unwavering hope of a brighter future. Both of us had tried to be like 
that but often found ourselves failing more than we would like to 
admit.
	At least, I decided, it would soon not be so lonely anymore 
around here. Not that I wasn&#39;t content with Rei and her grandfather. 
However, there were times, when Rei was away to college and such, that 
the shrine tended to feel like Tsunami had after our departure from 
Jurai. Vivid but yet not sufficient to hold my personal shadows at 
bay... I was being ungrateful just thinking that, yet I couldn&#39;t 
entirely help it. It was selfish, maybe the one true thing that I 
would readily admit to being such, and still I needed the company of 
others. The warmth and love of family, the light of loved ones. I 
tried to give it in return but what good was it if no one was there... 
Which wasn&#39;t true anymore. Rei was there and... her presence alone was 
enough to make me feel immensely lighter, taking away the many burdens 
I always felt weighing down on my shoulders...
	I exhaled lightly, having found my center, once more with the 
help of but a mere thought regarding the raven-haired miko. 
Fascinating, enthralling and altogether titillating. A gentle, 
peaceful smile played around my lips as I recalled the image of the 
fair beauty who was - and that was no metaphorical exaggeration - the 
very heart of this shrine. She was the physical avatar of the spirit 
residing here and as such none of those that had come before her could 
have hoped to develop a stronger connection to this place.
	Suddenly becoming aware of other presences in my immediate 
vicinity, my eyes blinked open and I could not help but blush in 
embarrassment being caught in such entranced contemplation which was 
only half the attempted meditation. If I had truly been meditating, I 
would have sensed their arrival earlier. Simply put, I had been more 
daydreaming than meditating. Not even to begin with the fact that I 
had currently been standing upright, leaning on my broom with which I 
had been cleaning just a few minutes before...
	Giggling nervously I quickly covered my embarrassment with a 
cheerful smile and wave of my free hand. &quot;Ohiyo!&quot; The two girls were 
clad in casual clothing. Both were black-haired but with enough 
superficial difference to tell them apart. The one on the left wore 
her hair open, falling past her shoulders, wearing a combination of a 
blue shirt and white miniskirt in typical Japanese school uniform 
fashion. She had light brown eyes, just like her companion. The girl 
on her right was clad more like someone who was expecting to move any 
given moment with their utmost capacity. Convenient instead of formal. 
Black leather pants and a shirt. I wouldn&#39;t define it as much 
tomboyish as the attire chosen by a warrior. Her hair that had a 
lighter shade than her companions, coming close to an actual brown 
with the right bit of illumination, was fittingly tied into a braid.
	They made a striking contrast to one spiritually gifted. Their 
inner spirits were honed and sharpened, and I could tell that as much 
as I was measuring them within the space of a few moments, they were 
doing just the same which created a respectful but somewhat vexing 
silence between us for but a mere second.
	&quot;Oh,&quot; I finally said, &quot;You must be the ones from Higurashi 
Jinja, am I right?&quot;
	&quot;Hai,&quot; the one with the darker hair and more... feminine style 
said. With her my senses were flaring actually. There was something 
particular... soothing about her. No doubt that she possessed great 
skill in the spiritual. &quot;I am Higurashi Kagome, and this is Sango. We 
came here to seek a new beginning in our lives.&quot; She was also rather 
polite, I noted. With no word did she comment on my age or raise a 
question about my presence even though I was fairly sure Rei hadn&#39;t 
given her family any indication that someone else was already living 
here.
	On the contrary, her companion was not so polite about it. 
&quot;Excuse us, but you seem somewhat young to be the granddaughter of the 
priest who we were told to expect...&quot; the one named Sango pointed out, 
earning herself a chiding look from the other girl. Bowing her head in 
apology, she relented. &quot;What I meant to ask is if the one named Hino 
Rei is in attendance?&quot;
	I smiled non-judgmental much to the girl&#39;s relief. I dared not 
pry deeper. I&#39;ve never been one to do so if it could be helped. The 
gifts at my disposal could probably reveal me much about their 
different paths. I did not wish to disturb their privacy if not 
necessary though. And just looking at the surface of her aura I could 
see that a terrible wrong had been done to this Sango, several 
actually, which had buried a colorful spirit under a mountain of 
bitterness, loathing and other such emotions, her sole real anchor 
being the other girl. For that last fact I didn&#39;t need to read auras. 
They were holding hands after all, doing nothing much to conceal that 
circumstance. That should be a dead giveaway for anyone with a little 
bit of imagination.
	&quot;Ah,&quot; I said at least, &quot;I have only come recently to this 
shrine. I doubt you have heard about me. I am Sasami by the way.&quot; I 
extended my hand and found it willing shaken by the other miko - of 
that I was rather certain. &quot;Rei-san has been so kind to take me in 
when I had no other place to stay and I&#39;ve been helping her out since 
then.&quot;
	&quot;She sounds like a nice person,&quot; Kagome said, her eyes betraying 
the casual tone. In that one handshake alone I had felt the great 
spiritual potential in the other girl and I was certain she had 
glimpsed something of mine. This one had sharp senses, maybe even 
sharper than Rei at her current level, and I had a feeling it would be 
hard to hide my peculiar nature from her.
	*She plays an important role though.*
	Before I could ponder that ominous statement from my other half 
though, I could sense Rei emerging from the main building. &quot;Ah,&quot; I 
said out loud. &quot;And there would be Hino Rei, caretaker and head miko 
of the Hikawa Jinja.&quot; I gulped slightly at the glare - lacking real 
ire - leveled at me when Rei came into view but the sight was worth 
it. The garb I had... exchanged for her usual clothes was a gift I had 
received from Auntie Funaho for my last birthday celebrated on Jurai. 
It was a little bit too big for me to fit in yet and besides, it 
suited Rei even better. I could not help the humorous smile and did 
not try to veil my affection. Rei&#39;s glare did not vanish but there was 
a hint of affection there too, as if in reply to my own.
	&quot;Don&#39;t let the little Miko-chan fool you. She is not as innocent 
as she makes one believe,&quot; the raven-haired girl said aloud. However, 
as she stepped past me to greet the new arrivals, she whispered, &quot;That 
was mean, missy. Extra chores for you.&quot; In a more gentle tone, she 
added though, &quot;It&#39;s still beautiful though.&quot; Rei favored me with a 
quick grateful smile and then she was past. It took me a moment or two 
to compose myself again, my heart still fluttering.

******************************

(Kagome)
&quot;Excuse my assistant, she means well. Really,&quot; the older girl said as 
she came to a halt some feet across from us. For a moment I thought of 
her in traditional miko robes instead of the strange... garb that she 
was wearing and could not deny the uncanny resemblance to my former 
incarnation as Kikyou. Hino Rei seemed to instinctually project all 
that you would expect from someone in her position, carrying herself 
with dignity and yet humbleness. I had at once the conviction that the 
Kikyou of old, before her tragic death, and this young woman would 
have gotten along well. And I didn&#39;t really need to access the latent 
memories that were a side effect of the final remerging of our soul.
	&quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; I said simply. I had never been one of overt 
formalities and judging by the interaction between the older and 
younger girl, I had the distinct impression that they weren&#39;t really 
the traditional, close-minded sort that you often discovered when 
dealing with religion nowadays... not that there hadn&#39;t been enough 
sad examples in the older ages. The lack of openness in a religious 
concept that was supposed to be more a way of life than a religion 
itself, had been scandalizing when I first fully comprehended it after 
I was able to see the entire thing with new eyes. My visits in to the 
Sengoku Jidai had taught me a great deal of respecting the traditions 
that grandfather had always tried to teach me. But only after 
acquiring most of my past incarnation&#39;s memories and knowledge upon 
our final merge in the eve of Naraku&#39;s demise could I truly see that 
many who thought to understand their faith, were blind to the reality.
	Kikyou had not just been a powerful priestess because she was 
gifted accordingly but even more so because she knew what to do with 
her gifts and what her faith really entitled. Many Japanese were not 
better than other practitioners of a different religion. Following 
prefabricated wisdoms without ever really understanding what they 
meant.
	Hino Rei though seemed to know very well that there was much 
more out there in life than the classical and traditional Shinto faith 
covered. True, Shinto - combined with Buddhist - faith might as well 
come closest to the workings of the world, if taken strictly and 
applying the core teachings instead of the many slogans found 
nowadays. But even we could not claim to know everything, neither 
could we claim our faith to be perfect and without flaws... or to put 
it better, missing certain aspects. And without really needing to ask, 
I could tell that Hino Rei had made similar discoveries over the 
years.
	For a few moments we stood like this in silence, each measuring 
the other. I wondered what the other girl was thinking about me. I 
knew that coming back into this time for good, many had commented on 
the change that had overcome me. In truth I did not so much saw me as 
having changed, but rather more having matured, grown a little wiser 
with the experiences, both good and bad, that I had made in the past. 
Without those adventures I would probably have never discovered my 
potential, always leading the bleak life of a normal schoolgirl. The 
typical example of Japanese society...
	There had been times I wished to never having fallen into that 
well but then I would remember all the good that had come with the 
traumatizing and bad, and I would reconsider that notion. I couldn&#39;t 
see myself going back to such a simple life, unaware of the world 
around us, and frankly I didn&#39;t want to.
	&quot;A nice style,&quot; the silence was eventually broken by Sango with 
this dry comment, laced with a little bit of humor that one saw so 
scarcely from her these days. She had really had it hardest from all 
of us and it was mostly for her sake that I had so readily agreed to 
Grandfather&#39;s idea. For once he actually had had a good one...
	I smiled in reply to my companion&#39;s remark. While the style of 
the raven-haired girl&#39;s robes was somewhat like a kimono, I had not 
seen something like that in this time and age, at least not in the 
normal small and unimportant shrine. To me, it appeared more like the 
formal clothing of royal house. And the laurel around her head was 
surely not standard fashion for a miko. &quot;I think it&#39;s nice.&quot;
	As if on cue, the younger girl with the very curious and 
mysterious aura piped up in ready agreement. &quot;Isn&#39;t it? Where did you 
find that, Rei-oneechan?&quot; The innocent look in the pinkish-red eyes 
could have fooled me, really, it nearly did... If not for the 
withering stare leveled from older upon younger miko. Thus the equally 
innocent-seeming batting of eyelashes made me chuckle involuntarily.
	Rei seemed to bristle for a moment, displaying a fierce temper 
the likes that I could sympathize with albeit having become much more 
controlled in recent years. Then she sagged her shoulders in defeat 
and in a dry tone complained, &quot;Oh, have fun with your hostess, will 
you not?&quot;
	Both Sango and the younger Sasami joined into the genuine 
laughter and after awhile even Rei&#39;s resolve crumbled and she joined 
into the casual display of kinship so easily displayed. Here we were, 
two groups of relative strangers, meeting for the first time, and we 
were joking about the interesting choice of clothing of our new 
hostess, apparently some kind of jest played by her younger apprentice 
or assistant or whatever position she held. It was nice to know that 
our lives hadn&#39;t turned so bleak that we could no longer enjoy such 
moments.
	My instincts, that I had learned to trust more than in fifteen 
years before my first travel to the past, told me, however, that 
something far deeper had just transpired than just casual and gentle 
amusement. There was a connection here between us that was intriguing. 
This meeting was not mere coincidence, it was fated. That much I had 
at once been able to perceive. There was an easy kinship immediately 
forming.
	That was something to be contemplated for another time though as 
the current episode was interrupted by a soft mewling sound that drew 
our hostess&#39; and her younger friend&#39;s attention. I looked down and 
noted that Kirara who had been trotting behind us before was pacing 
over to the young blue-haired girl. That was odd enough, considering 
that the cat Youkai did not immediately trust everyone, but here she 
was, all but purring and rubbing against the younger girl&#39;s legs upon 
reaching her.
	I shared a look with Sango who was equally baffled and felt 
myself confirmed in my earlier estimation of Sasami&#39;s aura... and the 
strange lack of disturbance that any would inflict upon surroundings 
when not totally in harmony with the Wa of the place. And she had said 
herself she hadn&#39;t been here long either. The innocent-seeming girl 
was indeed mysterious but by no means dangerous or harboring ill 
intentions, that I could tell with an immediate clarity that startled 
me. Considering all this, maybe it wasn&#39;t all that surprising to see 
Kirara act like this.
	&quot;What is that?&quot; Rei asked with a look of scrutiny, studying 
Kirara intently for a moment. &quot;Some type of cat?&quot;
	In the meantime Sasami had picked up Kirara, favoring her with 
an adoring smile and settled the smaller form of the Youkai on her 
right shoulder where she began to purr contently as if she never had 
done anything else than sitting there... which baffled both Sango and 
I even further.
	Recovering from the shock, my companion replied awkwardly, 
&quot;Something like that.&quot; I doubted either of the two believed that. They 
were both gifted and skilled way beyond what was to be considered 
normal in this day and age. It was a good thing though that Kirara&#39;s 
current state was not really a guise to hide her true self but simply 
a different form, which was not so easily perceived.
	Rei seemed to take Sasami&#39;s unspoken approval as reason enough 
to not ask any more questions for the moment. Turning around she 
indicated for us to follow with a wave of her hand. &quot;As long as it 
doesn&#39;t scare the birds away... Come on, girls, let us get you inside. 
We can talk more when you are settled.&quot;

******************************

&lt;Crown Fruit Parlor (Rei)&gt;
&quot;We are really sorry this comes so late. But you know, studying and 
all that...&quot;
I glanced with a mixture of exasperation and incredulity at the blonde 
on the other side of the booth. While the apologetic behavior was 
becoming tiresome, hearing Usagi talk about studying like it was 
something important, was still something that had the quality of 
mind-boggling. I suppose it is just a matter of finding the right 
motivation, I thought to myself. Our Princess had surprised us all 
when applying for Junior College with the intention of taking Art 
classes. However, if you looked a bit more closely you would easily 
see that she had improved in exponential leaps after taking the club 
in High School.
	&quot;Usagi. I told you already, it&#39;s alright. I barely had time 
myself, and things are just now starting to wind down a bit.&quot; 
Actually, they were winding down immensely. It had been a little more 
than a week after the new additions to Hikawa Jinja had arrived and 
between the four of us the hectic that had controlled my life in the 
last month had quieted down to bearable levels. I actually had time to 
concentrate more on my studies and catch up on the lost time of the 
last month. I could now easily go out in the morning for lectures, 
since the other three were always around.
	As for their education... Well, I wasn&#39;t sure about Sango but 
Kagome had barely finished Junior High School as far as I knew, 
repeating a year, and had voiced no clear intent on higher education. 
I wasn&#39;t quite sure if it suited her anyway. From all the new &#39;help&#39; 
acquired throughout the last month, Kagome possessed the most obvious 
knowledge and skill. I wasn&#39;t so sure about Sasami&#39;s level since I had 
the impression she was hiding a lot of what she actually knew and 
could do, but Kagome was another story. It was easy to see that she 
was the granddaughter of a fellow Shinto priest. I had an easy time 
acknowledging her as an equal. In fact her profound knowledge about 
herbs was better than mine. She was a natural-born miko and would make 
a fine priestess one day.
	&quot;That is good to hear,&quot; Ami said from her place next to me. &quot;And 
we know how it is. That&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve all been together since 
March.&quot; She glanced down at her watch with a frown. &quot;And I barely have 
much time to be doing this.&quot; I could sympathize. From all of us, Ami 
had it even harder than me in that first month of new education. Of 
course she had applied for Tokyo University to further her medical 
studies and coupled with that she was working at her mother&#39;s hospital 
part time as well as occasionally helping Setsuna with the project she 
had been indulging in for over two years now. The rebuilding of the 
Mugen Gakuen.
	&quot;Now, Ami-chan, I&#39;m sure we have time to at least have a small 
party for Rei-chan,&quot; Makoto admonished from where she was squashed in 
between Minako and Usagi, the latter having claimed the window seat. 
Said party consisted of some drinks and two cakes currently both about 
half-emptied... It didn&#39;t need to be said who ate most of them. &quot;This 
is REALLY good, Sasami-chan,&quot; the brunette admitted appreciatively, 
chewing on her piece. Usagi nodded vigorously in consent with our 
groups nominal cook. The others murmured in agreement. I couldn&#39;t 
quite hide a grin. It was a totally new event for Makoto&#39;s cooking to 
be contested but having sampled Sasami&#39;s skills for about a month now, 
I was not all too surprised.
	&quot;Yes, you are so lucky,&quot; Minako said with an envious glance in 
Sasami&#39;s direction, who was blushing from the praise. &quot;Having someone 
who can cook for you constantly and this good...&quot; She sighed. &quot;All the 
fame, and I still can&#39;t do a decent meal.&quot; And when she grabbed for 
the next piece, having just finished hers, and collided with Usagi who 
had done the same. The resulting tugging war that ensued was ignored 
by the rest of the table with polite indifference.
	I think we all needed some carefree event like that. Especially 
Minako had become far too... serious, too distant. It pained me to see 
her like that on more than one occasion. Despite being serious and 
mature than it came to Senshi matters, she had always been a vibrant 
girl. Displays of such childish behavior were rare these days and thus 
all of us ignored it, actually happy about them. She really needed to 
have some success in her love life, I concluded sadly, my own gaze 
involuntarily drawn to the form of the younger girl on my other side, 
giggling at the antics of my Princess and leader. When I caught myself 
for staring, I quickly averted my eyes before it had any noticeable 
outward effects. It was enough to struggle by myself with my 
growing... attraction... for the younger girl. Didn&#39;t need to let the 
others know.
	It was becoming harder and harder to ignore the growing 
affection between us. Especially with the arrivals of Kagome and 
Sango. Those two didn&#39;t make much of a secret about their 
relationship. Not that I was judgmental or something. Having spent 
enough time around Haruka and Michiru I think all of us had come to a 
point where we viewed same sex relationships as a natural 
circumstances that needed no further contemplation. Those two were 
rather open about it though, much more so than Japanese society would 
normally accept. I wasn&#39;t that narrow-minded. It was apparent in their 
aura alone that a lot about their relationship was about comfort and 
necessity. There had been something in their past that had been pretty 
traumatizing, especially in Sango&#39;s case, and so they provided each 
other with a much needed anchor.
	Minako eventually came out victorious in the struggle, making 
Usagi pout in a show of over-dramatized sulking and grabbed another 
piece, this time from Makoto&#39;s cake.
	&quot;Geez,&quot; Makoto commented dryly, &quot;I think I should be offended.&quot; 
The playful smile belied her reaction to suddenly becoming the 
replacement choice and the look she and Sasami shared was one of 
mutual acknowledgment of the other&#39;s skill. It was not hard to believe 
that they had taken an instant liking to each other. Actually all of 
the other&#39;s had. They knew about Sasami staying with me by now of 
course, but I had been a bit reluctant to take her along for what was 
supposed to be a private Inner Senshi &quot;party&quot;. Somehow I had the 
undeniable conviction though that I owed the blue-haired girl.
	It showed just how far we had come to grow accustomed too each 
other and it wouldn&#39;t be too long before the others would pick up on 
the significance of bringing someone along for what was supposed to be 
an event for our inner circle only... Minako had already given us a 
speculative look that all but said she knew right away what was going 
on. Dreadful, I tell you. For all her bad luck with own relationships, 
applying her skills to others had an almost hundred percent 
efficiency.
	All at once Usagi stopped devouring her piece of cake and stared 
at Sasami. Or more like the plush cat that she tended to carry around 
almost permanently... well, recently it was often Sango&#39;s strange pet 
creature - who&#39;s exact nature I still couldn&#39;t discern -, called 
Kirara, that followed her around. Obviously Usagi hadn&#39;t paid 
attention to the toy kitten before, but now her eyes lit up in 
childish glee. Some of the quirks that still lurked through her more 
serious, humbling behavior here and there. We wouldn&#39;t have it any 
other way, I suppose. Sometimes her resemblance to Serenity these days 
was... disquieting. We had all gotten so used to the quirky, cheerful 
blonde that it needed some getting used to, to see her really act more 
and more than a Princess and future Queen. These moments were 
assurance enough that Usagi still was herself underneath it all.
	&quot;Oh, how kawaii,&quot; Usagi exclaimed, &quot;Where did you get that?&quot;
	Sasami smiled happily, patting her plush kitten. &quot;Rei-chan won 
it from me when we went to the fair on her birthday.&quot; She rewarded me 
with a fond and grateful look that threatened to tear apart my resolve 
with hardly any effort. Did she have to bring that up now? And give 
such a direct answer...
	Predictably Usagi&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;The one in Harumi? No way!&quot; 
The blonde turned with an accusing expression towards me that made me 
wince without meaning too. &quot;That&#39;s not fair! You went to the fair 
without us! And you even got her a...&quot; She trailed off and seemed to 
think about what she was going to say, looking back and forth between 
us, before focusing on me again with wonder, &quot;... gift?&quot; she finished.
	I was aware that everyone was looking at me now as if I had just 
done something totally out of character... Fine, I was never one to be 
known for giving out gifts or going out of my way to win some prize 
for someone. That is, of course, because I never had someone who was 
worth the effort... I rethought the statement and scowled slightly at 
the implications.
	Huffing I did what I could best. Relying on my temper to divert 
the embarrassment I felt just now rushing to my face. &quot;Yes, a gift,&quot; I 
shot back at Usagi, &quot;So what about it? Am I not allowed to do get a 
new friend who just tried to make me feel a bit better something in 
return?&quot; The moment the words slipped out and I realized how that 
sounded, I wished I could take it back.
	Usagi didn&#39;t react for quite some time before eventually 
settling back into her seat, a small, knowing smile playing over her 
lips, that was almost as aggravating as the peculiar look Minako was 
favoring me with. Thankfully at least Ami and Makoto were tactful 
enough not to show much of their own feelings on the matter other than 
a short, meaningful look shared between them.
	The most annoying thing was that Sasami was watching the 
exchange with her patent innocent expression, as if she didn&#39;t get at 
all what had just transpired. Thereby I doubted Sasami was as innocent 
about the matter as she pretended to be.
	&#39;Great,&#39; I thought to myself with a scowl. &#39;I&#39;m doomed.&#39;

******************************

&lt;Hikawa Jinja&gt;
Connecting. Achieving a total harmony with yourself and by doing that 
with kami. I had always been good at that. At first, when I came to 
Grandfather&#39;s shrine, it was a way of centering myself, of leaving 
behind the sadness created from my mother&#39;s death or the anger I had 
felt by my father&#39;s coldness. I had readily taken up Grandfather&#39;s 
teachings that gave me another purpose, a different outlook on life, 
other than the loneliness and fury I felt at this time.
	Over time, I had come to accept the fact that this, being a miko 
in Grandfather&#39;s Jinja, obviously had been meant to be my fate from 
the very beginning. I was able to connect with the enshrined Fire Kami 
with an intensity and success that quickly surpassed even that of my 
own grandfather. It was a natural affinity, a closeness and normalcy 
that I often found comforting but also overwhelming.
	Understanding about why I had this ability of nearly direct 
communication with the spirit worshipped here came with the discovery 
of my other self. The reborn Senshi of Fire. No wonder the Sacred Fire 
often had felt more like a friend, a brother even. My control had even 
further increased parallel to my powers as Sailormars. It had really 
astonished Grandfather, and then he had often mumbled something about 
knowing that I was the right person for keeping up the tradition after 
all.
	My memories of my past life, which had returned gradually after 
the Galaxia battle, had helped to further strengthen my spiritual 
focus and understand better just what was out there. However, what had 
helped me most to ascend in my own spiritual training, was to spend 
about one month with Masaki Sasami. Granted, the girl had never been a 
miko or any other sort of practitioner of the Shinto faith. However, 
Shinto had never had a fixed doctrine. There was no ultimate truth or 
an ultimate power like in the Christian religion. Over time Shinto had 
integrated many different concepts from other religions like Buddhism. 
We were flexible... or at least supposed to.
	My assistant had a couple of rather revolutionary views on 
spiritual conduct, views that were surprisingly effective and that I 
could easily appreciate with the knowledge of past time memories and 
our understanding of the universe in itself during the Silver 
Millennium. I had found some of Sasami&#39;s ideas eye-opening. Especially 
her understanding of the spiritual plane - by some called Astral Plane 
- or the concept of subspace were refreshing and actually 
enlightening. While she admitted to only have some rudimentary 
knowledge, I&#39;d still like to meet her teacher... assuming she had one.
	And yet, with all my achievement in the spiritual area, this one 
tedious task still escaped my powers constantly. It was like trying to 
catch a mole in a field full of pits. Every time I thought I had a 
lock on the particular spirit it was gone again. Slippery like a frog 
or something... With a frustrated growl, I relented the effort, 
relaxing my sharpened senses for a period of recovery. There was no 
way I was giving up on this but frankly I was starting to exceed my 
spiritual limitations.
	I had been so immersed in the meditative trance I hadn&#39;t even 
felt the other presence in the inner chamber and reacted now with a 
start. Turning my head sharply, I forced myself to relax my tensed 
muscles as I spotted Kagome just standing there watching me closely 
and with some concern.
	&quot;You shouldn&#39;t tire yourself like that, Rei-san,&quot; the 
black-haired girl chided and then, with a thoughtful look at the 
Sacred Fire, added, &quot;Are you still looking for the Youkai?&quot;
	I nodded my head. The &#39;Youkai&#39;, as Kagome called it - to my 
knowledge regarded as a type of evil or mischievous spirit in the 
Sengoku Jidai era - had been &#39;seen&#39; around the city for a few days 
now. Nothing major had happened to attract attention but Ami had 
tracked its energy pattern back to some minor incidents. Seeing as 
this appeared to be a minor, spiritual problem, she had reported it to 
me. Frankly I think that hunting it down with all Senshi would be 
overkill. That made the task of actually catching it not easier 
though.
	&quot;Maybe you should ask Sasami-chan for help,&quot; Kagome continued 
nonchalantly. It really seemed nothing more than a passing comment but 
it offered an immediate reaction. As I had already been able to see 
within the first days after the two new girls came to stay here, it 
was becoming noticeably harder to hide my own growing feelings. Anyone 
who paid close enough attention could see the openly affectionate 
behavior between Kagome and Sango. And I had a feeling they wouldn&#39;t 
deny it either if someone openly asked... Which I wouldn&#39;t. For both 
politeness&#39; sake and a possible confrontation with my own budding 
feelings for a certain...
	No! I had sworn myself not to do this to myself. I didn&#39;t trust 
myself with love. All I would end up is hurting not only myself but 
also, and especially, the other person. The examples set to me had 
taught me as much. True, Usagi and Mamoru had set another kind of 
example but I hardly believed that such fairytale relationships 
happened more than maybe once in a long time. I wasn&#39;t sure if I would 
have the inner strength to go through the hardships they had to 
endure. Thus, I was better of without loving someone completely.
	It sounded much more convincing not so long ago.
	I glanced back at the fire as well, staring into the crackling 
flame as if it held the solution for my current problem. As much as I 
wished it to be, I knew as well that the Hikawa kami was not almighty, 
none of them were, and that that was a problem I had to solve myself. 
&quot;How do you mean?&quot; I asked quietly, not wanting my curiosity to peek 
through. I wasn&#39;t too sure if I succeeded.
	Kagome shifted behind me, her robe rustling slightly, as she sat 
down. When after awhile she hadn&#39;t said anything, I turned my head to 
regard her solemn, serious look. &quot;You two have something rare and I 
think you know it. There is a strong connection between you. A 
connection that could overcome many hardships if you let it grow.&quot; The 
haunted gaze of sadness overtaking brown eyes startled me momentarily, 
as Kagome continued, &quot;Do not waste too much time pondering, Rei-san. 
Sometimes before we really know what we have, it is taken from us. 
Beyond our reach.&quot; She shook her black hair, willing away the 
melancholic look and then with a faint smile added, &quot;It&#39;s just a 
friendly advise. Feel free to ignore me.&quot;
	I wasn&#39;t quite sure what to answer. I had seen it the first day 
already, that there was something fairly heavy weighing the two down. 
Some event in the past that had had a drastic impact on the people 
they were now. I hadn&#39;t pried, it was not my place. Besides, it seemed 
all of us four had a similar tale to tell. Maybe that was why we fit 
so easily together. No one would question the other, mindful of their 
privacy and own feelings. It was alright that way. And yet I could not 
help but wonder what could bring such bitterness and pain to the 
younger girl. She was normally such a nice person, always mindful of 
other&#39;s needs.
	&quot;Was where someone like that for you... or Sango?&quot; I carefully 
breached the line rarely touched between the four of us. I felt a bit 
more comfortable doing so than being questioned myself about THAT 
matter. While I was ready enough to let it drop if need be, there was 
a certain distance between all of us, and it might be time to bond 
more than just through the casual acceptance.
	Kagome didn&#39;t answer right away. In fact, she stared unblinking 
into the fire for several seconds, stretching out into a full minute. 
I was about to tell her to forget the question but then she bowed her 
head slightly and was about to say something when...
	At first it was a faint buzz on the edges of my awareness but it 
quickly came closer, becoming more pronounced and more familiar. 
Familiar because just minutes before I had been trying to scry for it 
without much permanent success. And now it was here. Right at the 
Jinja...
	Right outside where...
	&quot;It&#39;s here,&quot; Kagome remarked, having stifled her answer and 
listening with senses other than her primary ones.
	I was already in motion though. I didn&#39;t even stop to think 
about the rationality of the action but all I could think about was 
that Sasami was supposed to be out in the yard right now. Kagome&#39;s 
words from moments ago came to mind and refused to let go. With grim 
determination I rushed outside, ready to take on whatever was there 
threatening my youngest assistant.

******************************

(Sasami)
Life was looking up right now. I hadn&#39;t even thought of it like this 
when I suggested Rei to take up the offer to have Kagome and Sango 
stay here, however, it seemed the seeds for a close quasi family had 
been sowed and there were high chances for a deeper friendship 
developing between all for us. Oh sure, a bystander could probably 
tell that there were quite a number of secrets and mysteries about 
each of us, but that was fine. Everyone seemed to accept that as a 
given. There was a basic level of trust already, from moment one 
onwards, and the barriers between our two groups were becoming thinner 
with each passing day.
	Funny that in my mind I already considered Rei and me a &quot;group&quot;. 
The other two girls were beyond doubt a couple, but Rei and I had 
barely known each other and yet, after just a month, I felt already 
very much inseparable from the older miko. It seemed love on first 
sight was true after all. Actually, that was a fact as far as my 
experience was concerned. Love was awakened at the first meeting. You 
might not recognize it for what it was at first but it still happened. 
Sometimes you wouldn&#39;t recognize it at all. Being maybe too stubborn 
to admit the truth to yourself, or being too innocent to understand. 
The latter was the case for Tenchi, I suppose. I was barely eight 
years old in all aspects but chronological age when we awoke in 
Earth&#39;s orbit. How was I too understand love then?
	Rei was a stubborn case though, someone scarred already in the 
past and I would have to be very careful in pursuing a relationship. I 
wouldn&#39;t make the same mistakes as I had with Tenchi. From him, I had 
expected too much, too fast. I had clung to his promise before we left 
for Jurai, clung to it because deep down I knew, even though he had 
not acknowledged it, that his choice had already been made. 
Subconsciously I probably had tried to force the issue then by pushing 
a little too hard... Something I regretted now but that was impossible 
to change.
	Rei though, Rei was different. What I felt for her was similar 
to what I had felt for Tenchi, yet different. Stronger, more potent, 
and responded in kind. I knew very well what it had meant for Rei to 
take me along to the private party with her friends. The, for her, 
enormous show of trust. That was something to build hope on. Carefully 
of course. Rei was emotionally rather fragile. Hiding herself behind a 
certain aloofness, repelling any kind of deeper commitment. However, I 
had seen the real her. Both with and without her friends who she 
obviously cherished very much.
	It would be a slim path to walk but I was prepared for it. I 
wanted to succeed here, I wanted to gain Rei&#39;s full trust and her 
heart. We were meant to be. I was certain about it. I had to be. Why 
else had I felt that strong pull when we first saw each other, so 
unlike anything that I had experienced before?
	And unlike Tenchi, I was certain that the miko would understand 
my unique condition when the time came to reveal this. I could tell 
her now, maybe I even should because I felt more than a little guilty 
being privy to her own secret, but I also wanted to see, wanted to 
know if my pending assimilation with Tsunami was such a great obstacle 
as it obviously had been to Tenchi and I, or if it didn&#39;t matter all 
that much. I needed to know that. For myself.
	I smiled fondly at the mewling sound from my right shoulder and 
ceased my current work of sorting in the new ofudas Rei and Kagome had 
made just yesterday. Reaching up I petted Kirara much to the 
creature&#39;s delight. One could easily mistake it for a cat if not for 
the two tails and the eyes. Cats were supposed to be rather 
intelligent already but this one had an almost human-like awareness. 
Of course I could tell what she really was and that knowledge had my 
curiosity on fire, wondering what a creature of her origin and power 
was doing with two normal girls who all but radiated supernatural 
skills themselves to my sharp senses.
	&quot;What do you say, Kirara? Do you think I&#39;m right that Rei likes 
me... like that?&quot; I asked, seeking some sort of confirmation besides 
being rather sure of the progress we were making. However, I was also 
unsure that I wanted to or even could take another rejection, not when 
what I was feeling was so intense already that it would have made me 
blurt out my feelings if not for knowing that the very thing might 
make Rei uncomfortable enough to ruin the entire thing.
	&quot;It&#39;s not always easy, isn&#39;t it?&quot; I turned at the voice, seeing 
Sango coming up through the yard. Kirara made a sound and jumped down 
to join her actual mistress. &quot;One-sided love probably hurts the most,&quot; 
she continued in a distant tone. My heart reached out at the sorrowful 
expression on the other&#39;s face but I was also a little puzzled by the 
comment.
	Sango seemed to notice, snapping out of the moment more or less 
immediately. &quot;Not that I think it&#39;s one-sided between Rei-san and you. 
You two seem to be practically inseparable to me. Hard to believe you 
only knew each other a bit more than a month.&quot; Saying this, her gaze 
became distant once more, but she shook it off. Admirable I had to 
admit. Despite all the stain I could clearly read in her aura, Sango 
still managed a brave front most of the times.
	&quot;You and Kagome-chan seem to love each other very much,&quot; I 
remarked carefully, gauging a reaction, stating a fact both Rei and I 
were certain of but had never acknowledged out loud so far. I could 
hardly believe the other girl would consider her feelings one-sided. 
Maybe their relationship had started out on a different basis but a 
blind person could probably see the deep affection, the obvious love 
between the two.
	For a moment, Sango was about to say something but then stopped, 
deep in thought. After a moment her face lit up as if she just 
realized something very important, a thin but genuine smile starting 
to form on her lips. &quot;Yes... Yes, we do that, don&#39;t we?&quot;
	I was a little perplexed at the sudden shift in behavior, since 
I had hardly believed my statement that prying or creating such a 
positive effect. At least she seemed more happy now. Not the 
bitterness that would occasionally peek through and vanish then just 
as quickly again in regret when the other girl realized it. From what 
I saw, whatever had happened to her should have broken a normal human, 
but Sango had a strong willpower that seemed to carry her through and 
actually began to win against the looming shadow covering her spirit, 
slowly but surely.
	&quot;She cares about you a lot. You must feel very lucky to have 
her,&quot; I said. In fact I had often felt just a tiny bit envious of 
their open admission of feelings for the other, longing to experience 
a similar thing. &quot;I think she loves you very much. I&#39;m sure you are 
grateful for that.&quot;
	Sango&#39;s smile brightened a little more and she closed her eyes, 
looking for all the world as if nothing could hurt her that very 
moment. &quot;I am,&quot; she whispered, sounding actually surprised saying 
that.
	*You have such a talent for that, you know?* I could hear 
Tsunami&#39;s fond voice echo in my mind.
	Huh...?
	Before I could voice my confusion, however, Sango&#39;s eyes 
suddenly snapped open and with two steps was standing protectively in 
front of me, Kirara hissing at her feet. Blinking, I began to focus on 
my surroundings, discarding Tsunami&#39;s comment for the moment. I had 
been so preoccupied in the conversation and with Sango&#39;s confusing 
reactions that I had almost missed the approaching presence if not for 
Sango&#39;s reaction.
	I squinted my eyes at the direction from where I felt the 
presence approaching rapidly over the Astral Plane with an obvious 
malevolent intent. There was something unsettling about it though, 
something that didn&#39;t feel right. Unnatural. And I felt the sudden 
impulse that it&#39;s intention was too strike swift and fast. And Sango 
was not able to deal with a spiritual attack like that, the giant 
boomerang she had brought with her currently absent from her attire.
	&#39;Drastic measures then,&#39; Tsunami and I thought pretty much in 
synchrony, focusing our essence mainly on the Astral Plane, ready to 
confront whatever was about to come...
	Only that the spirit or whatever it was, abruptly stopped its 
approach when it caught sight of us... or better Tsunami. Wavering for 
a moment, the presence shifted uneasily before turning tail and 
running away faster than it had approached, if that was even possible.
	Well, there were definite benefits being bonded to a Yggdrasil&#39;s 
dryad, I mused and turned around when I heard the commotion of running 
footsteps announcing the arrival of Rei and Kagome who must have 
sensed the spirit&#39;s approach too.

******************************

(Sango)
I blinked confused at the sudden retreat of the spiritual life form 
that had had my senses tingling brightly just a moment ago. I turned 
my head towards the younger girl standing behind me, narrowing my eyes 
slightly. There was something about her I couldn&#39;t quite put my finger 
on. She didn&#39;t let anything on, whether she had even sensed the same 
thing as I had - which I was pretty sure of - or being responsible for 
the hasty retreat. Kagome and I had quickly established that the 
youngest member of our group was indeed powerful, just how much though 
was hard to tell.
	Any question I might have directed at the blue-haired girl was 
cut short though when Rei burst out of the main building, Kagome only 
a few steps behind. The raven-haired &quot;Head Miko&quot;, as all of us liked 
to teasingly call her since our first meeting, was beyond doubt 
frantic and worried. She masked in well under a hard mask of grim 
determination. Her eyes briefly scanned around the yard but were 
always drawn back to us... or actually to Sasami.
	I exchanged a look of mutual agreement with Kagome when Rei 
practically ignored me and started fussing over a stunned - but quite 
obviously happy - Sasami, inquiring about her wellness and the sort of 
things a concerned lover might do... I smirked and wryly commented, 
&quot;Gee, thanks for not asking how I am doing.&quot;
	Of course, the statement was mute, since the next moment Kagome 
had stepped next to me, resting a gentle hand on my shoulder. Turning 
my head I could see the concern in brown eyes and suddenly had to 
swallow a lump. That brief talk with Sasami earlier had made me see 
something very important, something I hadn&#39;t allowed myself to really 
acknowledge yet. For various reasons, reasons that I really needed to 
talk about with Kagome. I needed to be certain, just for my peace of 
mind, I guess.
	I looked at the other pair of would-be lovers and shook my head 
softly, tugging at Kagome&#39;s hand. &quot;They&#39;ll be busy for awhile. Come 
on, I need to talk to you.&quot; The timing was probably horrible, what 
with the almost attack and all that but I needed to get this out 
before I started to doubt again.
	Puzzled Kagome followed a good distance away from the other two 
miko before finally speaking up, worry still evident. &quot;What happened?&quot;
	&quot;Nothing really,&quot; I assured her. &quot;The Youkai, or whatever it 
was, suddenly stopped and retreated. Just like that.&quot; At Kagome&#39;s 
dubious look, I added, &quot;I really don&#39;t know what happened. Maybe it 
was her...&quot;
	Further confused, the black-haired girl asked, &quot;Who?&quot;
	I chuckled softly, walking a few more steps, back turned to my 
lover. &quot;She&#39;s quite an intriguing girl. I can&#39;t figure her out. 
Somehow she seems to be able to say just the right thing to get under 
all your defenses. Without any real conscious effort, I believe.&quot; 
Sasami&#39;s words had indeed not seemed like she meant to provoke the 
reaction that she got out of me. Yet, that innocent, plainly spoken 
manner in which she stated the obvious, or what she thought to be the 
obvious, was positively refreshing.
	&quot;Oh,&quot; Kagome seemed to catch on. &quot;Hai, she&#39;s quite amazing.&quot; 
After a moment, Kagome asked thoughtfully, &quot;You think she has anything 
to do with the Youkai retreating?&quot;
	I turned around and walked back the short distance between us. 
&quot;I&#39;m not sure. I just know that I didn&#39;t do anything that I am aware 
of.&quot; Kagome still looked somewhat confused, unsure why exactly I had 
wanted to speak to her in private. I had to smile fondly at the 
expression and reached out to touch her cheek, running my fingers 
along soft skin. &quot;I love you. You do know that, right?&quot;
	For a moment Kagome closed her eyes at the touch, her features 
softening, becoming almost serene. My smile deepened. &quot;I do, 
Sango-chan,&quot; she answered with no doubt in her voice, but still 
clearly bewildered. It was not exactly the answer I wanted to hear. I 
chewed on my bottom lip, biting back speaking out loud what I thought. 
That wasn&#39;t the point here, not really. What exactly was the point... 
that was something I wasn&#39;t totally sure of myself. Just that we had 
to talk about this.
	&quot;You still love him,&quot; I said, without judgment or bitterness. Or 
at least so I thought. Of course she still loved him. After all that 
happened... Even if someone you loved once was beyond your reach, it 
did not diminish those feelings. I should know that myself and on some 
levels I did. Still, this was obviously one of the main reasons for my 
doubts... and fears...
	Kagome blinked, startled and for a moment not quite 
understanding. But then comprehension dawned in her eyes and she got 
that look, a mixture torn between compassionate and apologetic, a 
little sad too at the memory of Inuyasha. &quot;Of course I do, Sango... 
I...&quot; Kagome echoed my thoughts, making my heart sting despite my best 
efforts. From the confirmation but even more so from the unfairness of 
my implied words. Kagome really didn&#39;t deserve this. She had been 
there for me all this time, who was I to forbid her these undeniable 
feelings? &quot;That doesn&#39;t change anything between us though. I thought 
you knew that I...&quot; she trailed off, swallowing the words that were on 
the tip of her tongue but wouldn&#39;t come forth, hadn&#39;t come forth. In 
all this time over the year since I had followed her to this era. And 
that was the root of the problem now, wasn&#39;t it?
	&quot;You still can&#39;t say it, can you?&quot; Again it was more a statement 
than a question. It was obvious enough. Those three words I longed to 
hear, just once, she couldn&#39;t bring herself to say them. I wasn&#39;t 
quite sure why. Maybe because she was still clinging to Inuyasha&#39;s 
memory. Maybe something totally different.
	Kagome looked away, shame briefly flashing in her beautiful eyes 
and making me feel like a complete idiot once more. She stepped away, 
turning her back towards me, and only after awhile replied softly, &quot;Do 
I need to?&quot;
	And once again, I recalled Sasami&#39;s words from earlier and the 
truth that lay within them. If someone as young as her, albeit awfully 
perceptive for her age, could see it, how could I still deny myself 
the truth? All this time Kagome had been there for me. She had come 
for me when Naraku had me tortured, she had been there for me when 
Kohaku... She had been there for me all this time, comforting... 
loving. &quot;I would like to hear you say it,&quot; I admitted, &quot;But, you are 
right, I don&#39;t NEED to.&quot;	
	Kagome turned around surprised, looking at me questioningly, 
&quot;What do you...?&quot;
	I stepped forward and took her hands in mine. &quot;You&#39;ve shown me 
more than enough times but I never really appreciated it. I guess, 
I... Maybe I was scared.&quot; I had to admit, having known the simple 
truth for quite some time now, but afraid to see it, afraid to 
acknowledge its presence. I had always been strong, needed to be 
strong. But after the ordeal just prior to Naraku&#39;s demise... I had 
been broken and alone... But at the same time not. Kagome had been 
there, all this time, despite all that happened.
	&quot;Why?&quot; my lover asked softly.
	I wasn&#39;t really sure what to answer. &quot;I... don&#39;t really know. 
Maybe, because my love was used against me once already...&quot; It had 
been my feelings, so carefully tugged away that had almost hurt the 
one I loved most so direly. And not only that, but also my feelings 
for Kohaku had made me vulnerable. And then the horrible choice that 
bastard forced upon me... I could still see it now. Clear as if it had 
been yesterday, frozen in my memory that horrible moment when those I 
loved most were pitched against each other and I had almost lost them 
both... I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to shut out the nightmarish 
memories, haunting me many nights. &quot;I have already been tainted 
once... I don&#39;t want to be the cause of your...&quot;
	Kagome&#39;s hands had slipped free from mine and I felt a finger 
against my lips. &quot;Shh... You are NOT tainted. You are the bravest and 
sweetest person I know, Sango-chan. Your heart is strong and I DO 
trust you with my life.&quot; I melted at the words, spoken with utmost 
conviction, no doubt clouding her beliefs. The amount of sincerity and 
trust was overwhelming.
	&quot;Kagome-chan... Arigato, for being there for me, all this 
time...&quot; I whispered hoarsely, fighting back tears. Barriers I had put 
up ever since that accident, against everyone and everything, even 
against Kagome, especially against Kagome, were falling apart all of a 
sudden. The last months had built up towards this moment, I suppose, 
but first after arriving here at Hikawa Jinja had I really started to 
think about the true state of our relationship. I had been content in 
its idle, stagnate state, giving me some resemblance of order. But it 
was not that simple and I wanted more. I wanted to finally break free 
of the memories of the past and really start my new life here in this 
time, with Kagome who had been at my side all this time.
	&quot;I will always be there for you. I promised, remember?&quot; Kagome 
said. And that was true. She had promised. And it had never been a 
promise just out of necessity or because Inuyasha had asked her to. I 
realized that now, fully, totally realized it and that realization 
chased away the fears and nightmares for the moment, leaving a healing 
warmth behind.
	&quot;Hai,&quot; I acknowledged and following the overwhelming need for 
closeness, pulled Kagome into a tight embrace. The younger girl melted 
against me and tilted her head upwards to meet mine in a rough kiss, 
that was slightly bruising and definitely demanding. I could feel her 
hands tightening on my back as small whimpers escaped from her 
occupied lips. Pent-up emotions were released in the process as I 
basked in the willing reciprocation of not only desire but love. It 
really didn&#39;t matter whether she said it out loud or not, I already 
knew. They say, actions speak louder than words, and in this case the 
saying held absolute truth.
	I felt more free than I had in a long time and even Kagome 
glowed positively when we finally pulled away. We had delayed this 
confrontation for far too long in my opinion, had lurked into the 
security of the basic understanding of our relationship. But now, that 
I had this talk behind me, I felt so much better... and was, quite 
frankly, in need of something more... intense. I looked over Kagome&#39;s 
shoulder at our fellow miko and confirming my suspicion, said in a 
husky voice, &quot;I think those two will be occupied for awhile. Let&#39;s go 
inside and...&quot;
	Kagome giggled, her smile deepening, &quot;What do you have on your 
dirty mind?&quot;
	&quot;Hmm...&quot; I purred, &quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot; And with that I pulled the 
unresisting Kagome back to the main building, and our room.

******************************

(Sasami)
&#39;Well, so much for that,&#39; I mused. That had worked out easier than I 
thought it would. That thing had been rather determined to do whatever 
mischief it had planned. I just wish that I had gotten a better look. 
Linked as I had been for a short moment with Tsunami, I could have 
told exactly what kind of entity it was that had just evacuated the 
Jinja quite frightened. It would come back though. I wasn&#39;t sure how I 
could tell but I knew it would.
	*I think we drew some attention,* Tsunami commented as we pulled 
apart once more. I felt somewhat dizzy, those instances of 
quasi-assimilation were taxing and I almost always needed some time to 
reorient.
	Under Sango&#39;s scrutinizing gaze I felt quite exposed though and 
with resolve forced a somewhat nonchalant expression on my face. Not 
that it would do any harm for them to know but truth be told, I didn&#39;t 
want them to know. I had thought long and hard about this, especially 
about telling Rei. And I had to admit, a small part of me was scared 
of my newfound friends reaction. All I wanted was to be accepted as a 
normal person and not showered with feelings of awe or maybe even 
fear. Tsunami was a part of me but she also wasn&#39;t a Goddess or some 
such nonsense, something many did not understand. I would tell them, 
eventually, when the time was right and when I was sure they would 
accept me for who I was, not for what I represented.
	Thankfully, Sango&#39;s attention was diverted by the arrival of Rei 
and Kagome, most likely drawn by the alien presence invading the Jinja 
grounds just moments ago. I was still a little fuzzy from the 
impromptu channeling and was thus caught off guard when Rei 
practically made a beeline for me, only looking around a few times, 
confirming that the area was clear.
	I was rather shocked when Rei placed her hands firmly on my 
shoulders, the taller woman looking down with unrestrained worry in 
her purple eyes that made me swallow quite a few breaths for a moment. 
&quot;Sasami, are you alright? What happened here? I... We... felt 
something... That evil spirit I&#39;ve been tracking... Did it hurt you?&quot; 
The words were jumbled, eyes scanning hurriedly up and down my body 
with increasing concern.
	And I smiled. A thin, hidden smile, but I smiled, seeing my 
earlier observations confirmed so thoroughly. &quot;I&#39;m fine, Rei,&quot; I said 
softly. &quot;Whatever it was obviously decided it wasn&#39;t worth taking the 
risk.&quot; Which was more or less true. I guess Tsunami and I had overdone 
it a little, channeling our will like that, but neither of us wanted 
to take any chances as exposed as we had been. And so, confronted with 
such a display of power on the Astral Plane, the creature had rather 
sought to retreat and think up a better strategy... which would give 
us time to prepare as well.
	&quot;Really?&quot; Rei asked, still quite troubled but relief showing in 
her voice. &quot;Good. That&#39;s good.&quot; And then, the raven-haired miko 
blinked, the sudden rush of adrenaline obviously ebbing by the 
placating of her fear for my safety. HER fear for MY safety. My heart 
had to have made a few flip-flops. This was exhilarating!
	Rei&#39;s face took on a slightly rosy color now, as she stuttered 
something incoherently. &quot;I mean... I...&quot; As if just now fully 
realizing her actions, the older girl turned away, flushing with 
obvious embarrassment. &quot;That is good, yes... Very... good...&quot; She took 
a few deep breaths as I watched patiently, basking in the apparent 
concern, brought into the light by the situation. After several more 
seconds, she squared her shoulders and turned back to face me again, 
features controlled once more but it wasn&#39;t hard to see how fragile 
this control was. &quot;Gomen nasei, Sasami-chan. I&#39;m not sure what came 
over me...&quot;
	I decided to take pity on her and also give her something to 
think. Placing a gentle hand on the taller girl&#39;s shoulder, I looked 
up at her and made sure she saw exactly how grateful I was. &quot;You were 
worried about me. Arigato.&quot; It felt indeed very good. Rei was so hard 
on herself, showing extreme emotions so rarely. Especially when it 
considered matters of the heart. I felt sad about the apparent lack of 
love she had experienced during her childhood. A feeling I could to a 
degree sympathize with, even if for different reasons.
	A repressed shudder ran through the other girl&#39;s body before she 
pulled away abruptly, taking a few steps backwards to put some 
distance between us. Normally I would have been offended or saddened 
at least, however, I knew how hard this was for her. I had seen it so 
often happen to my sister, trying to reign in her feelings and being 
only partially successful. Especially when it concerned Tenchi. 
Besides, I had already gotten a wonderful gift out of this and 
whatever Rei might say or do now, the message her concern had 
delivered was crystal-clear.
	&quot;Ah, I was just... concerned about Sango and you being all alone 
out here with something we have no information about...&quot; Rei tried to 
cover and I nodded for her benefit but kept the partially hidden 
smile. Evasive tactics were good and fine if they were appropriate. 
But the earlier reaction rendered this one quite meaningless. &quot;So, you 
said it suddenly turned tail and ran?&quot; the older Miko asked dubiously 
in an attempt of changing the subject.
	I nodded, noticing just now that Kagome and Sango had retreated 
to another portion of the yard and were talking. &quot;Seems so,&quot; I 
answered guardedly. &quot;Maybe it was afraid of the holy energy here.&quot; 
Rei&#39;s look as much as told me that she didn&#39;t believe me and for a 
moment her eyes narrowed. I was almost sure she would query if I had 
done anything and I really didn&#39;t like outright lying.
	However, just as I thought Rei was going to say something, her 
resolve seemed to break to my considerate surprise. Heaving a sigh, 
Rei turned to the side, her long hair hiding her face from view. &quot;At 
least you are safe,&quot; she whispered, too soft for ordinary hearing to 
pick up... but then again, I wasn&#39;t to be considered ordinary. Neither 
of us was.
	My smile was now quite open and I took a step towards her, 
reaching out to touch one of her hands with my own. Rei glanced up 
sharply, caught off guard as she had obviously not counted on me 
hearing her. &quot;I can take care of myself, Rei-chan.&quot; The suffix didn&#39;t 
slip out unconsciously. We had grown much closer and when in private 
like now, I sometimes let a certain familiarity slip in, watching 
carefully for a reaction. So far the other had not shown any offense 
by it.
	Now though, Rei hesitated a moment before pulling her hand away, 
averting her gaze again. &quot;I know that... It&#39;s just...&quot; She sighed 
again, frustrated this time and then after awhile of fidgeting, she 
asked with both confusion and seriousness. &quot;What is happening to us?&quot;
	I hadn&#39;t expected such a direct question but it was obvious that 
Rei had realized there was no covering for her reaction and that I 
understood implicitly what it meant. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening to 
you,&quot; I said eventually. That wasn&#39;t exactly the truth though. I had a 
pretty good idea but most of it was still speculation and I would 
surely not decide the feelings of other people. That was something for 
Rei to figure out. &quot;But,&quot; I stepped forward again, noting that Rei 
stood her ground, watching me out of the corner of her eyes probably, 
&quot;I think you already have some idea,&quot; I finished softly, reaching out 
to brush the long black strands away hiding the older girl&#39;s face.
	Rei&#39;s gaze seemed torn, confused... vulnerable. &quot;Sasami, I don&#39;t 
know... I can&#39;t...&quot;
	&quot;Then don&#39;t,&quot; I stated firmly before standing up on my tiptoes 
slightly - Rei was still a good bit taller than myself after all - and 
placed a soft, fluttering kiss on the white skin of her cheek. &quot;Don&#39;t 
rush yourself. I can wait.&quot; And with that, I passed her by and walked 
back to the main building, wondering slightly what had made me do 
this.
	*Didn&#39;t you say that you didn&#39;t want to force this?* Tsunami 
asked, picking up on my own thoughts.
	I did, didn&#39;t I? But then again, it was apparent that Rei was 
struggling with herself and it would still be some time until she 
resolved it. Some motivation would be good and also... I wanted her to 
know. What I had done just now was nothing short of declaring my own 
deeper feelings for the raven-haired miko who had taken me in. I had 
long since admitted it to myself that I had fallen in love with her. 
There was no sense in keeping that a secret anymore. In fact, not 
knowing how I felt in return, could just as well provoke Rei to shy 
away from making up her own mind.
	It wasn&#39;t really pushing for a reaction. I just wanted her to 
know that I would be open for more than friendship and that it was in 
her hands now. I wouldn&#39;t do anything more besides that. The 
experience with Tenchi had taught me that. I had sworn not to make 
that mistake with Rei again.
	Anyway, what was done, was done. Rei knew now that I appreciate 
her concern - and more. I&#39;d have to see what happened next. In my 
heart, there was the unmistakable conviction though that this time, I 
had found the right one for me. All that was needed now, was time.

******************************

(Rei)
Stupid. Stupid! STUPID!!!
	Raging at myself didn&#39;t get me one step further but at least it 
was distracting. Only slightly though. The scene just a few hours ago 
was still fresh in my mind and would obviously not budge for a longer 
period of time. It was even breaking through the tight meditation and 
making me stray from my internal focus more than once... which only 
served to further frustrate me.
	How could I have acted so... so... foolish! Yes, foolish! Like 
some lovesick puppy, emotions overriding reason in a way that surely 
wasn&#39;t healthy. Physically but mostly for your sanity. I didn&#39;t need 
that, I had told myself time again and again. I was fine on my own, 
with my companions, those kindred souls I was gratified to call 
friends. That was enough for me... And then one month ago my entire 
worldview was thrown into chaos by one single girl with a charismatic 
smile and an aura full of intriguing mysteries. Only one meeting was 
necessary, only one look, one time our eyes had locked... And just 
like that, I was lost. Lost, defenseless against her in ways I had 
previously thought impossible.
	But I couldn&#39;t be. Love for me was destructive. It had destroyed 
mother and father in the end, making everyone unhappy. How was I 
supposed to be better off? It&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t long for it. I could 
admit that to myself, that a part of me had never stopped to wonder, 
to hope, for someone, somewhere at some point of time... And yet it 
was impossible. I was... scared. The truth was shocking me for a 
moment but it was true after all. I was scared, scared of the same 
thing happening to me that happened to my mother, the disappointments 
of a love and trust shattered... And I was afraid that I could be the 
cause of such a thing. And she didn&#39;t deserve that. No, Sasami surely 
did not deserve this.
	But what could I do now? A fool would have gotten the message. I 
wanted to deny, hide myself behind the veil of doubt, of uncertainty. 
Before it had been so easy to tell myself Sasami wouldn&#39;t be looking 
for something like that. I had been able to list numerous of reasons. 
And still, in the end they all failed to stand upright in the face of 
the simple truth that from our first meeting onwards something had 
formed between us that tied us involuntarily together.
	And Sasami knew.
	I bit my lip. What could I do now? What should I do? All my 
training had not prepared me for this, had not taught me how to handle 
a situation like this. How should it? I lacked the normalcy of a 
loving family, parents happily married to set an example of support 
and constant affection. And I had long since accepted this, resolving 
myself to the life I had found here with my grandfather and the fate I 
thought so clearly belonging to this Jinja.
	&#39;I&#39;m not getting any further with this just lamenting,&#39; I chided 
myself, hardening my resolve. &#39;After all, she said I should take my 
time, right?&#39; It was a comfortable alleviation of the problem... Such 
a shame that I also knew taking too much time could very well hurt her 
feelings. And that was something, I really didn&#39;t want to do. Did that 
mean, I... No, all it meant was that I cared. And what was not to 
care, to like about the gentle blue-haired girl? There was...
	No, not now! I strongly resisted the urge to take that path 
again that I had caught myself following so often as of late. I needed 
to get my mind cleared. Not only to sharpen my focus on that 
particular problem, but also the current one. That evil spirit was 
still in the vicinity, not too far away. Whatever - or whoever - had 
made it flee like that, had obviously only tempered triggered its 
flight instinct. Actually, it was much easier to follow now since it 
seemed to stay mostly in one place. If I were to hazard a guess. I 
believed it was plotting.
	What I had glimpsed before was some low-level spirit gloating 
with overconfidence doing some mischief but that had changed already 
when I caught it moving here. There had been a sudden focus, a sudden 
increase of anger. What before seemed like a purposeless, erratic 
pattern, suddenly seemed to be centered. Now more than before. Could 
it be the spirit was after something in the Jinja or on these grounds? 
That would rule out the assumption that the holiness of the area had 
served to repel it. I found that hard to believe to begin with. The 
sudden fixity on this area was clearly marking some higher interest. 
But what kind of interest? For what... or for who?
	I pushed back the emotional response, knowing that the timing 
was most likely coincidental and it could just as well have been me 
and Kagome out there instead of the other two. It didn&#39;t need to be 
Sango or... Sasami.
	But it could.
	I shook my head angrily, irritated and tired. Not so much 
physically but mentally. After the uncharacteristic burst of panic and 
the scene that followed, I felt somewhat drained and it took me a lot 
more effort to find the proper concentration. And yet just the thought 
of a repeat of the circumstances that had made me act so rashly were 
enough to at least confirm that the creature, whatever it was, was 
still in the immediate area... Although it appeared unlikely that it 
would make another move anytime soon, considering it had been in one 
location for hours now.
	Gently slipping out of the meditative trance, I stretched my 
tired limbs before getting up in front of the Sacred Fire. It seemed 
we were safe for the night. It was already late and I definitely 
needed a couple of hours sleep, if only to get my muddled feelings 
into order and set my priorities into the right order again... 
Whichever that was.
	There was no way though I was going to be caught unprepared 
again. Right now I couldn&#39;t trust myself that in the case of the evil 
spirit moving here again, while we were all asleep, that I wouldn&#39;t 
wake in a similar state of embarrassing panic, overcome by 
unreasonable concern. I knew logically that Sasami was talented enough 
to defend herself - especially since I hardly needed telling that 
there was a lot more to her than met the eye - but my heart would not 
allow me the luxury of logic and reason. Besides, I was responsible 
for the safety of those under my roof, and no demon, evil spirit or 
Youkai, as Kagome called it, was going to catch me napping twice. The 
next time it dared to enter here, it would learn the folly of its 
actions.
	With that in mind, I left the inner sanctum of the Jinja and 
headed outside. Gathering a couple of ofudas, I spent the next minutes 
carefully and strategically placing wards around the Jinja grounds, 
making sure to draw on some knowledge from my past life as to how to 
overlay their effects best in order to create a sufficient shielding 
that would take quite a bit of both power and prodding to break 
through.
	When I went back to the main building I found Kagome standing in 
the sliding door, watching with a thoughtful look. As I approached, 
she nodded towards me, &quot;Looks good to me. Somehow I get the feeling 
though that we are missing something here.&quot;
	I snorted. &quot;We are missing a lot of somethings. For example why 
that spirit is interested in this place so much that it suddenly 
developed a focus for what it was doing. Or why it suddenly fled 
although having a clear interest in this area.&quot;
	Kagome nodded again, thus confirming my theory. And I valued 
that, really I did. The other black-haired girl albeit slightly 
younger had a vast pool of knowledge and amazing spiritual perception. 
She hadn&#39;t said how long she had studied but I was sure, it had to be 
probably as long as I had... since childhood. &quot;That&#39;s not what I mean 
though. There is... I don&#39;t know, a familiarity. I know I felt this 
particular aura before...&quot; Her gaze was unfocused, obviously deep in 
thought. After a few moments she shrugged though, &quot;I&#39;m sure it is 
nothing special though. Together, with all our skills, it shouldn&#39;t be 
a problem.&quot;
	&quot;Yes,&quot; I mumbled, acknowledging the logic but still not quite 
able to shake off that nagging feeling of unease. &quot;I hope so.&quot;

******************************

(Kagome)
I wondered what was bothering me so much about this. It was definitely 
a Youkai&#39;s energy. I could distinguish that even from this far. It 
wasn&#39;t terrible strong, actually rather strange, distorted, as if 
cloaked by something else... A shame that I never had much chance to 
test and hone this ability. Since neither Kikyou&#39;s nor my senses had 
been that strong, I was still wondering if this new ability was the 
jewel or a side effect of the merging after all. In this modern age 
though, the creatures of myth and times long past were mostly hiding 
and I had never had much chance to really tell apart just what I 
picked up. Ability without experience.
	It would help a lot now. It would help even more if I had had it 
back then. So much that I knew now, would have helped back then, would 
have made so much of a difference, could have... I cut off that 
thought, irritated to find myself so lost in &quot;would be&quot; and &quot;could 
have&quot; possibilities. It was done now, it was time to leave it behind 
and move on. Sango needed me now. Not just in presence, but also in 
actual life. I still hadn&#39;t let go after all, had I? Torn between that 
what was lost and what was still there. I had committed myself to 
helping her through her own trauma without really mastering my own, 
pushing it back...
	Sitting on the edge of the bed, my thoughts too occupied for 
sleep, I let my fingers ran through the dark strands of the sleeping 
Sango&#39;s hair. I wished I could be as strong as her. It seemed she was 
finally getting around, just as Grandfather said - as amazingly as 
that was. What she needed was some time away from familiar 
surroundings, somewhere away from where she could not lose herself in 
the ordinariness. And so needed I. I wondered if my grandfather had 
thought of that. Possibly. I had always admired the other girl&#39;s 
strength of heart, even after all that happened she was still alive 
and not giving up. But for whom...
	&quot;I don&#39;t really deserve this, you know?&quot; I said softly to her 
sleeping form. Sango had been right. I hadn&#39;t let go of him. But how 
could I? There was so much to remember about Inuyasha. I could still 
see it before my eyes, those last moments... The arrow, MY arrow...
	Breaking of the thought, I tugged out the chain from underneath 
my robe, staring into the gleaming depths of the purplish jewel 
where... &quot;What should I do, Inuyasha? I love her but...&quot; I couldn&#39;t 
say it out loud. I always felt like I was betraying him. Making an 
absolute choice, deciding for one and discarding the other, never 
admitting that feelings had existed in the first place. That was 
foolish though. He was gone and even if I was with another now, it 
didn&#39;t less what we had, could have had... And if he had still been 
alive and I made the choice... Did that make my feelings for him just 
disappear?
	No.
	I honestly couldn&#39;t say why I could not just tell her. It&#39;s not 
like there hadn&#39;t been a spark even before Naraku started to lay out 
his ultimate trap which eventually had led us down to the path we had 
to follow. We had already came closer then. Closer than I had ever 
thought possible. I had to admit that learning about Sango&#39;s feelings 
had shocked me a little... and also flattered me somewhat. I had never 
been all that popular with the boys in school and hadn&#39;t really cared 
much. But ever since I met Inuyasha things had changed a lot, I guess 
I had changed a lot to. I hadn&#39;t know what to do with Sango then, 
knowing that I did love Inuyasha but not wishing to hurt her either, 
especially not after what she went through. I understood perfectly 
that what she did, she did for me and that left me felt torn, unable 
to reject her. That would have surely broken her.
	In the end, the decision had been pretty much taken from us.
	And now look where we were today. One would think that it was 
Sango who depended on me after the unspeakable things done to her. 
Maybe that was true, but I had also come to depend on her presence. We 
had no one else left here - well, except Kirara - and we could offer 
each other mutual consolation. But it had been over a year already. 
Wasn&#39;t it time that things changed, for the better? Wasn&#39;t it time 
that I started to try and leave the past behind? Sango was trying so 
hard... I should do too. So that I could return her feelings as much 
as she deserved.
	The jewel glowed slightly between my fingers and I smiled 
softly. &#39;You heard me, didn&#39;t you?&#39; I thought silently to myself and 
then tugged it away again.
	It was good after all that we had come here, for both of us. 
That reminded me that I really had to thank Sasami. I wasn&#39;t sure what 
exactly she had done but I felt a little lighter now knowing that 
Sango was getting back on track... and that I had realized my own need 
to return to the present instead of dwelling in the past and the 
comforting veil of idleness. We both needed to move on, not just 
because I promised Inuyasha, but for ourselves, first and foremost.
	With that resolved, I stood to shrug out of the robe, ready to 
join my lover in bed and maybe a bit less troubled sleep than usual. 
In fact, Sango was breathing easily, no signs of nightmares so far. I 
was happy about that. Of course, it could be that she was still worn 
out from our activities earlier. I smirked, knowing that - for all her 
physical fitness and superiority - I could still manage to do that.
	Just as I was about to loosen my robe, a sudden movement caught 
my attention, making me halt in my action. Kirara was awake and 
hissing softly in the direction that let outside to the yard. She 
stood agitated and poised, ready to jump into action every moment now 
but was obviously unsure herself of what exactly had triggered her 
senses.
	I was about to say something while already checking with my own 
skills, a supposition taking already form, when I was startled again 
by Sango suddenly sitting up. It was silent and had I not watched her, 
I probably wouldn&#39;t have even registered her moving. One could see 
years of training coming to the forefront as she carefully looked 
around while sliding out of the bed and grabbing for her clothes. 
&quot;It&#39;s here,&quot; she said simply.
	That was unnecessary though. I could already sense it. Too 
preoccupied with my thoughts, I had not noticed the Youkai move. But 
now it was like a bright flame in a dark room. There it was. In the 
yard! Past the initial wards already! How was that possible? I had 
watched Rei place the wards. It shouldn&#39;t have been that easy, not if 
the power level I had estimated was the true one. Or was that cloaked, 
too?
	&quot;Kagome,&quot; Sango shook me out of my thoughts, already dressed in 
her casual clothes that were no real replacement for the armor she had 
usually worn for battle but offered best nimbleness while drawing 
minimal attention, &quot;We have to stop it before it starts to wreck havoc 
here.&quot; And with that she grabbed Hiraikotsu, her trusted boomerang 
made of Youkai skin, shouldering it easily.
	&quot;Right,&quot; I nodded, falling into step behind her as Sango rushed 
ahead. I really wished I had a bow and arrows at hand. It&#39;s not like 
we carried our weapons around here. This wasn&#39;t the Sengoku Jidai. 
Back then, barely anyone would have batted an eyebrow. It was normal 
in those times of war and constant conflict. Nowadays carrying around 
a giant boomerang and a bow with quiver and arrows was about to draw 
some attraction. Also, what would we need it for? After all, who would 
attack us here?
	Well, there was my answer. Slithering and hissing in the middle 
of the yard, blood red eyes turned our way as soon as we burst out of 
the building into open air. Eyes filled with the bloodlust of 
vengeance. And suddenly, confronting the looming, oversized snake 
Youkai face to face I knew exactly what it was.
	&quot;Sango,&quot; I called out, &quot;that is...&quot;
	&quot;I know,&quot; she responded darkly, catching Hiraikotsu, that had 
passed through the creature without doing any damage, &quot;I see it now, 
too. A dead&#39;s Youkai spirit, bound to this plane and unable to let go 
of whatever grudge it is feeling.&quot;
	&quot;Yessss,&quot; the snake apparition hissed menacingly, &quot;And I 
ssssshall have my vengeanccce!&quot; And then its eyes flashed darkly, just 
before a sudden wave of water appeared out of thin air, threatening to 
bury us underneath. Too surprised to react, I probably would have been 
flushed away. However, Sango had reacted instinctively and the next 
moment I found myself airborne held in a strong, protective grip.
	The Youkai spirit didn&#39;t give us any time to catch our breath 
though.

******************************

(Rei)
Half an hour later and I still wasn&#39;t in bed... Kami, I really did 
push myself too much sometimes. This time though the events of earlier 
in the day were still playing havoc on my calm state of mind... or 
would if something like that still existed. The situation had come to 
this after all. Just as I feared... and hoped for - just a tiny part 
of me, but it was still there. I had suspected from the start that 
there was something deeper than just a possible friendship behind our 
meeting. That there was more to be gained... or lost. Now I stood in 
the face of the problem that had become undeniable, Sasami all but 
dropping any pretense. It wasn&#39;t like she had been persistent, 
expected a reply or something like that... Maybe it would have been 
better like that. At least then I could have blamed either heart or 
brain if something went wrong otherwise. Now I had to decide what to 
do... and that was the root of the problem.
	&quot;Rei, what troubles you? You look like you&#39;ve been scared by a 
ghost,&quot; Grandfather observed. I had gladly welcomed the distraction 
when I found him up and about, sipping some herbal tea in the kitchen 
area that Sasami had obviously prepared. His physical state had gotten 
better recently. Surprisingly enough, where Sasami&#39;s mere presence 
before had helped to achieve this, Kagome&#39;s knowledge of herbs and 
natural medicine was surely Kami&#39;s blessing. Where modern medicine 
failed to combat a problem properly, nature always found a solution 
after all. It wasn&#39;t like he was totally healthy again. The long 
illness had left its marks and he was still rather pale and weak. It 
was getting better though.
	&quot;It&#39;s nothing really, Jiji,&quot; I replied evasively, cursing once 
again his perceptiveness, had to come with the age. I could do without 
it right now.
	&quot;If you say so,&quot; he shrugged and took another long sip and after 
that added casually, &quot;Sasami is a fine young girl, she seems to have 
grown on you, too.&quot; The hidden smile neutralized the effort of a 
seemingly innocent comment and I found myself blushing. Grandfather 
only smiled more openly. Respecting and honoring your elders or not... 
Sometimes I hated it that Grandfather had to be always so... wise 
whenever it came to my personal life and problems. He usually left me 
alone with them but never made much of a pretense that he didn&#39;t know 
what was going on in most cases. Even now when he had spent most of 
his time in bed! I tell, you annoying!
	He didn&#39;t elaborate further on the subject though, obviously 
sensing that I was too aggravated already. Instead he gave me a 
critical look as if to evaluate my worth, which made me somewhat 
uneasy but the eventual result of the examination was a crooked grin. 
&quot;Nice dress by the way.&quot; I blushed, realizing that I was once again 
wearing Sasami&#39;s robes. At first I had just done it to defy the 
teasing of the others and after that... Oh, who was I kidding? It had 
done good to see Sasami&#39;s happy and pleased smile whenever I did. &quot;A 
bit unorthodox I have to admit but hey, who am I too complain. At 
least it shows that my hardworking granddaughter is special.&quot; That was 
typical Grandfather for you. Mixing jest or teasing and appraisal 
together. The veiled praise though did make me feel good. I wasn&#39;t 
quite sure how Grandfather actually took all the new additions over 
the last month, from a priest&#39;s point of view. That he obviously 
appreciated - at the very least acknowledged - my efforts was actually 
managing to calm my heart a little.
	&quot;I didn&#39;t do it alone...&quot; I began, by all gratitude for the 
praise, knowing that a big part of my success had been due to the 
other three girls... and especially Sasami, of course. That was when I 
felt the sudden invasion of the grounds. Already past some of the 
initial wards. Not broken, just bypassed.
	Grandfather made to rise but I quickly admonished him with a 
sharp look. &quot;Not in your condition, you are not. Stay here until I... 
we get things under control.&quot; Narrowing my eyes I delivered the silent 
message that I would bear no argument on this and only relented when 
the older man nodded sagely.
	Wasting no more time I was in motion already. It was the same 
aura from earlier in the day. I had not expected it to move tonight. 
It didn&#39;t seem like it would try so soon, not after the hasty 
departure of earlier. Either the spirit was just rash or actually 
smarter than I thought, anticipating that we would not expect it to 
move so early again. Whatever it was, I had sworn to myself not to let 
it come even close to harming anyone under my care again. And whether 
I wanted it or not, Sasami and to a degree the others too, were under 
my care. Staying at my home, I was responsible for their safety.
	I nearly bumped into Sasami running down the corridor. It was 
obvious she had been alerted to the alien presence on the Jinja 
grounds as well. I shot her look of concern, not wanting her involved 
in the coming conflict if somehow possible... But Sasami shook her 
head firmly, her eyes boring no argument. There was something ancient, 
far older when her physical age, lurking beneath pink eyes which threw 
me for a moment. That other presence I always felt somewhat linked to 
Sasami was much more prominent now, radiating maturity and 
reliability.
	We were wasting valuable time. Knowing the other two, they 
probably had felt the spirit already. So, I sighed resignedly and 
continued to hurry outside, Sasami following just a little behind me. 
There had been another reason why I didn&#39;t want Sasami involved. If 
the others were around, I could not fall back on Mars if worse came to 
worse. And soon enough I found myself wishing I could. Just as we had 
stepped outside battle instincts took over and I barely managed to 
push Sasami and myself out of the way of the sudden... rush of water 
impacting against and shaking the old building.
	I glanced sharply at the scene before me. Seeing the giant snake 
loom in the center of the yard. Sango, one arm around Kagome, carrying 
both in an evasive jump to safety. While I still marveled at the 
agility and subtle strength of the other girl I quickly found out that 
the supposed safety was a relative one. The snake hissed in obvious 
anger - or more like rage actually - and turned to their new location, 
summoning another torrent of water, too fast for the pair to evade 
this time since they were just touching down. Sango pushed Kagome away 
and took the blunt of the attack, throwing her through the air quite 
some distance. The demonic creature took quick advantage of the 
situation and the now seemingly helpless Kagome, conjuring up another 
burst of water magic...
	&quot;No!&quot; Sasami burst forwards before I could hold her back, 
running right for Kagome to my growing horror.
	I grabbed for an ofuda but realized with certain trepidation 
that I would be too late. The demon, or whatever the creature was, was 
very fast with its attack and soon enough a just recovering Kagome was 
beginning to be buried under another cascade with enough force to 
crush a weak dam, and with her my younger blue-haired assistant, the 
girl who had become such a good friend in barely just a month&#39;s time, 
the girl that had just today more or less declared her willingness to 
deepen our relationship. The girl that I cared too much about to lose 
now to a random whim of fate.
	&quot;No...&quot; For a moment only my heart clenched with sudden cold, 
only for a moment. Because in the next it flooded with relief again, 
albeit accompanied by a fair amount of wonder. The onslaught of high 
pressure water was suddenly met by a blazing globe of blue-green, tiny 
wing-like blades of light could be seen whirling about in a protective 
circle. A barrier of some sorts. My first intuition was to believe 
Kagome responsible, the other Jinja daughter had certainly enough 
skill and power at her disposal from what I could tell. But looking 
closer now I could see Kagome still kneeling and it was actually 
Sasami who stood, clearly straining, maintaining a high level power of 
such quality that I wondered if it not even surpassed Saturn&#39;s Silence 
Wall...
	It was eerie, actually scary and very hard to comprehend... But 
right now all I cared about was that Sasami was safe, that both were 
safe, and, turning to regard the demonic creature who had dared enter 
these grounds and thought it could go around attacking and killing 
those under my care, that something was going to pay dearly for this. 
I sharpened my boiling anger, not suppressing it but fueling my focus 
with it. Right now I was the one responsible for the Jinja, for its 
safety and that of everyone who lived here. I would teach that evil 
spirit that no one angered Hino Rei, Sailorsenshi or not.

******************************

(Sango)
I have been trained to fight since I was little. Actually I had 
participated in my first real battle much earlier when was normal for 
the children in our village. Often had I faced impossible odds but 
always found that I could rely on my training, instinct and wits to 
prevail against any opponent with very few exceptions. Hunting and 
exterminating Youkai was a dangerous job, one that could get you 
easily killed when you made a mistake. All of us had made a mistake, 
not seeing Naraku&#39;s trap before it was too late and that had ended up 
nearly killing us all. That was when I had met Inuyasha and the others 
and started to rely more on group work and support than usual. Yet 
that didn&#39;t mean that I wasn&#39;t able to take care of a problem myself 
anymore.
	That is, if the problem didn&#39;t happen to be a several feet tall 
snake-like Youkai. That alone wouldn&#39;t have been a problem. The real 
unnerving thing was that it was technically dead already, driven by an 
infernal thirst for vengeance. Vengeance obviously directed at us now. 
I wondered why that was? I was pretty sure we had never fought a giant 
snake Youkai before. I think I would remember that.
	Tugging myself into a roll I managed to land on my feet, moments 
after taking the beam of water into the side. My mind was feverishly 
trying to think up a way of combating this thing. Physical attacks 
would barely harm it. The seemingly solid body was just a shell, a 
tool. Which left only... That was when I happened to glance back 
towards Kagome, realizing with dawning horror that the Youkai spirit 
wasn&#39;t focusing its attacks on me. My breath caught for a long, 
infinite-seeming moment as I saw the torrent of water snapping its 
hungry mouth shut over the place where I was certain my lover was 
right now.
	&#39;No!&#39; I screamed internally, my mind rebelling against the 
thought that this could happen again. Thankfully enough the moment was 
broken just as quickly as it had begun when a barrier of blue-greenish 
light flickered into existence that made me simultaneously gasp in 
relief and astonishment. The only thing I could really compare it with 
were Miroku&#39;s barriers, but his paled in sheer potency against this. 
And it wasn&#39;t Kagome who did. That wasn&#39;t the Shikon&#39;s power.
	Deciding that I could dwell on that later, I took the 
opportunity just as Rei started to draw the Youkai&#39;s attention away 
from the pair, displaying an angry but calculated rage that was all 
too understandable. I felt like renewing my attack as well but held my 
feelings in check, my strategic mind overriding the impulse. My own 
spiritual powers were barely adequate. I was a fighter, not a 
priestess, miko or other form of spiritualist. I did know a little but 
not enough to be of great help here. This was more in Kagome&#39;s area.
	Or Rei&#39;s, as I noted with fascination, seeing her engage the 
snake spirit in fierce, spiritual combat, keeping it busy for the 
moment. But it was apparent that her ofudas and spiritual powers 
barely seemed to do anything more than annoy the creature, which 
really worried me. I could not fathom how something reeking this much 
negative energy could even breach the Jinja&#39;s barriers. There was 
something more going on here.
Shaking my head, I realized that standing around here thinking about 
it was not getting me any further. I was sure Kagome had already 
figured something out. What she needed now was a bow and arrows. It 
gnarled me to leave the side of the battle, but that was the only and 
best thing I could do right now.

******************************

(Kagome)
I was still dizzy from the fall I took when Sango pushed me away and 
my immediate concern was with her and how she had taken the hit. I 
knew my lover was tough and had survived much more. However, without 
her armor... So I was distracted and did not realize my own peril 
until it was almost too late. Making a split-second decision, driven 
by the crystal-clear realization that I could not leave Sango alone 
now, not be the another loss, I concentrated on the Shikon no Tama 
and...
Didn&#39;t need to even drew an ounce of power - much to my relief - since 
the next moment I saw a flash of blue - other than the water - rush in 
front of me, followed by an outburst of almost overwhelming spiritual 
energy. The barrier was made of pure mana, or that is at least what I 
thought, a power output that would have sent even Kikyou into stupor.
That was when I saw it though. The apparition with blurry outlines and 
I recognized right away what it was I saw there. &#39;A dryad,&#39; I thought 
in wonder, &#39;and a very powerful one.&#39; It bore a striking resemblance 
to Sasami actually and sure enough as I fully focused on the figure 
standing in front of me, I saw that the ghostly figure was merely an 
extension of the younger girl&#39;s aura who stood her ground right now 
with strained concentration.
	&#39;What is she?&#39; I wondered, still stunned by the discovery. The 
girl wasn&#39;t normal. I had already known that when we first met. That 
she was already bounded to an elemental of such high standing and 
power only underpinned that theory. There was still more though that 
even with Kikyou&#39;s knowledge I wasn&#39;t quite able to grasp. No dryad, 
be they ever that strong, should be able to manifest that much power 
as I felt in the barrier. Not unless...
	I suppressed the shudder and was thankful when my focus was 
broken by another impact against the barrier. Sasami shuddered under 
the strain. I could see through the semi-transparent field that Rei 
had a hard time getting through to the Youkai. In fact her efforts 
didn&#39;t even seem to bother him. Something just wasn&#39;t right here. 
There was something protecting it from the positive-charged attacks of 
the older miko. The thing wasn&#39;t that strong on its own and a dead 
spirit should be especially vulnerable to clerical power. I had been 
suspicious already when it started to conjure up water so easily as if 
it itself were some kind of elemental creature and not just a lousy...
	I glanced back sharply at Sasami and the discovery I just made 
about her... She shuddered under another attack and I could see the 
form of the elemental growing more pronounced the stronger her host 
concentrated.
	Of course! The cloaking power I felt earlier. That was it.
	&quot;Rei-san!&quot; I called out. There is an undine spirit attached to 
it! That is how it could slip through the wards!&quot; I wasn&#39;t sure if she 
heard me or if it would even do any good. This was a Fire Jinja. If 
the thing captured itself an elemental spirit of the opposite power it 
would act as both a shield and a cloak against the holiness of these 
grounds and the attacks Rei threw at it. Elementals were natural 
beings, they weren&#39;t effected by holy powers as much as a more demonic 
creature would. The Youkai was obviously borrowing its powers right 
now. There was something familiar about this too. Borrowing powers...
	Just as realization hit me, Sasami fell to her knees, still 
holding the barrier upright. I doubted that the problem was that the 
field wasn&#39;t strong enough. Without wanting to exaggerate, from what I 
could sense it probably could survive the backlash of a heavy 
detonation at point-blank range. No, the real problem was that keeping 
it upright was putting a strain on the younger girl.
	If I just had my...
	As if on cue, Sango, who I had lost sight of, appeared at our 
side, carrying a bow and a quiver of arrows. Thank the kami that she 
was clever enough to read a situation instinctively and act 
correspondingly. &quot;Sasami-chan, let go. I take it from here.&quot; The 
blue-haired girl almost immediately collapsed the barrier, thankful 
for the breather. Rei had managed to temporally distract the Youkai 
spirit again, but not for long.
	Snatching the bow from Sango, I stood upright and had an arrow 
aimed within a few moments. Narrowing my eyes and forcing myself not 
to see with my peripheral vision, it took but another moment to detect 
what I was looking for. There was obviously the working of a magical 
entrapment and a presence similar to that of Sasami&#39;s dryad.
	&quot;You are still the same dirty cheater, &#39;Suijin&#39;!&quot; I called out 
drawing its attention but much too late since the arrow was already 
flying, leaving a blazing trail of holy energy that struck home with 
clear accuracy, breaking the binding spell that held the undine inside 
captive. It was yet too weak to break free on its own but the source 
of the Youkai spirit&#39;s power was gone, as was the protection it could 
draw on against our efforts. &quot;Rei-san, now!&quot;
	The older miko didn&#39;t hesitate much longer. Holding up a single 
ofuda she chanted under her breath, her voice rising in volume as the 
simple paper strip began to radiate in a deep crimson, fiery glow. 
Deprived of its equally stolen power source, the spirit was once again 
the low level creature it had once been in life. It didn&#39;t stand a 
chance at all.

******************************

(Sasami)
The conclusion of the battle had been anti-climatic really. Rei&#39;s 
final attack had pretty much ripped apart the spirit, freeing it 
finally of the vengeance thirst that had driven it for a long time. 
That was what puzzled me actually. Tsunami was certain the spirit was 
old. At least several centuries. However, it seemed like Kagome and 
Sango knew the creature when it was still alive and that grudge that 
chained it to this plane was obviously caused by them. Neither had 
elaborated much and in fact we were all too tired to discuss 
everything right now. It was the middle of the night already and the 
battle had exhausted me.
	I had never before summoned the Light Hawk Wings like that. 
Tsunami had told me that I should be able to do so with growing 
experience and age but the strain was phenomenal. I really wondered 
how Tenchi did it. Then again, his projection was self-made while I 
still partially drew from an outside source. I suspected that when we 
were fully assimilated, summoning the Wings wouldn&#39;t be that much of a 
problem anymore.
	That didn&#39;t make me feel much better right now. Keeping up the 
barrier had drained me of pretty much all my internal resources and I 
would have opted to sleep right there in the yard, not being able to 
move a muscle and honestly not wanting to. I smiled inwardly at the 
memory of a gallant Rei picking me up and carrying me back to my room 
with utmost care. And here we were now. I, on the verge of slipping 
into dreamland, and her, sitting on the edge of the bed, her 
expression pensive, much more open than usual.	
	Silence hang in the air like a heavy blanket while I studied the 
older girl carefully, trying to judge her mood and what she might be 
thinking right now. She hadn&#39;t made to move - and leave me to sleep - 
for about two long minutes now, just sitting there, staring out of the 
window distressed, troubled. It was as if she feared that I could 
vanish on her any moment. While the thought of that much concern made 
me feel giddy, I could also see the unease in the raven-haired miko.
	Mustering some remote strength, I reached up with one hand to 
touch her cheek, making Rei blink and focus on me with startled, 
purple eyes. &quot;I&#39;m alright, Rei, really. Just tired. Nothing a good 
night&#39;s sleep can&#39;t cure,&quot; I assured her, managing a soothing smile.
	&quot;If you say so.&quot; Unfortunately it did little to dispel the 
troubling expression and as nice as it was to know that Rei was 
concerned about me, I never liked to see people sad or worrying like 
this. The older miko surprised me by taking my hand in hers holding it 
in a firm grip. &quot;You scared me out there,&quot; she admitted softly.
	I closed my eyes, knowing that this might come but unable to 
suppress the pang of disappointment and sadness in my heart. That was 
why I had not wanted to reveal too much of my own power, did not want 
to let her see what I was capable of before I was certain of her 
feelings, certain that it wouldn&#39;t matter. I had been so sure that she 
was the right one for me, that she wouldn&#39;t... But I suppose it was 
only natural to be scared of the kind of power I wielded. That didn&#39;t 
mean that she thought any less of me...
	&quot;I could have lost you tonight,&quot; Rei continued, startling me out 
of my thoughts. Blinking my eyes, realization dawned on me that I had 
just made a false assumption. The other girl hadn&#39;t even referred to 
the feat I had just pulled of, she had been scared of possibly losing 
me. I couldn&#39;t contain the flush of embarrassment and neither the 
flattered feeling. &quot;And I...&quot; I glanced up seeing a storm brewing in 
purple eyes boring into me with an intensity in which I threatened to 
drown. &quot;I couldn&#39;t stand that. Not until I know, for sure, what I...&quot; 
She struggled with her words, clearly reluctant to admit anything more 
than she already did.
	I squeezed her hand gently. &quot;I&#39;m still here, Rei-chan. Thanks to 
you, and everyone.&quot; I couldn&#39;t help the question that sprang to my 
lips though, curious about the one thing that I dreaded could drive a 
wedge between our growing relationship as it did with me and Tenchi, 
with me and the others. Everyone I cared about... &quot;You... aren&#39;t even 
curious about what... I did?&quot; I queried, believing the issue had 
simply been pushed back for the moment, overridden by the stronger 
emotions of concern for my welfare.
	Rei blinked and wondered obviously what I was talking about for 
a moment. Finally she got the implications and her voice became 
serious. &quot;You saved Kagome and yourself,&quot; was all she said at first, 
as if that already was the end of the matter. Eventually she added, 
&quot;Of course, I am curious. However, we all have secrets, don&#39;t we. 
Kagome-san and Sango-san too. How can I expect you to tell me yours if 
you don&#39;t know my own or that of the others?&quot;
	I thought about that for a moment, amazed at the sincerity and 
conviction in the older girl&#39;s tone. The logic would have been more 
comforting if not for the fact that basically I knew her secret 
already, thus making me feel guilty for holding back on mine.
	&quot;I&#39;m sure you will tell me when you believe it&#39;s the right 
time,&quot; Rei clarified, curiously enough saying exactly the thing I 
needed to hear right now, to placate my guilt and firming the 
impression I had that if that time came, Rei would understand, 
probably better than anyone ever had.
	&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; I admitted simply, giving her hand another squeeze 
before letting go. I was horribly tired and really needed my sleep 
now. As if on cue, a yawn escaped my lips. &quot;I guess I should sleep 
now,&quot; I said with a chuckle, intending to lighten the mood.
	Rei seemed not entirely convinced yet that I was alright, 
despite the physical and spiritual exhaustion that is. &quot;Are you sure 
you&#39;ll be alright? You can stay in bed tomorrow if you want and rest. 
I&#39;m sure we can manage one day without your divine cooking.&quot; A faint 
grin played around her lips.
	&quot;Sounds nice,&quot; I replied with another yawn, finding it hard to 
even concentrate. And from what I could see, sheer stubbornness was 
the only thing holding the other girl awake, concealing her own tired 
state. I reached out once more to touch Rei&#39;s cheek and with a gently 
chiding but firm tone, said. &quot;Go to bed, Rei-chan.&quot; And unable to 
resist the opportunity, added teasingly, &quot;Unless you want to sleep 
right here.&quot; The other girl&#39;s face flushed crimson. &quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s big 
enough...&quot; I trailed off.
	As if stung by a bee, Rei hastily jumped up. &quot;Ah... That&#39;s 
not... necessary. I think I can still make it to my room.&quot; She 
hesitated for a moment longer, looking back at me once more. &quot;Are you 
sure that you are...&quot;
	This time I sent her a look that showed my unrestrained 
annoyance. As nice as the concern was, I REALLY needed my sleep and if 
she didn&#39;t let this drop right now, I intended to make good and 
serious on my teasing and drag her under the covers with me just to 
get some sleep.
	To my remote disappointment, Rei seemed to get the message now 
and backed out of the room quickly. &quot;Right.&quot; With a softer voice just 
before she closed the door, she added, &quot;Oyasumi, Miko-chan.&quot;
	I stared at the door for a few more seconds, wondering if I had 
imagined the last bit in my drowsy state. A nickname? Deciding to 
dwell on that later and that trying to dispel the possibility would 
rob me of a pleasant feeling, I closed my eyes, whispering softly, 
&quot;Oyasumi, Rei-chan...&quot;

Author&#39;s Notes

And another down. Beginning this side arc I had planned to do only two 
main parts but then things began to develop more and more in my mind 
and I soon realized that wouldn&#39;t work, it would become too long. So 
basically I made a cut here since it was the best spot to do so.

As for notes. Well, I think I started to hint at some of the secrets 
and background here. Keep in mind that when you read this, there has 
been some time between canon end/where I interjected into canon and 
this story, so a lot of things have happened that you are not supposed 
to know about unless you are me, my muse or Ay-chan. :) Those 
histories will be revealed in due time. Some here, some in the main 
arc. It&#39;s a big and interwoven project after all. For now, speculate 
all you want, this part should have given you plenty of fuel to do so.
Yes, the Inuyasha element only follows canon to a certain point from 
where I changed the story &quot;a little&quot; as you probably suspected 
already. Don&#39;t ask me what exactly happened to the two girls that made 
them what they are now. As said above, all in due time.

I&#39;m not sure if I mentioned that earlier but I think I didn&#39;t. Most of 
the references to Rei&#39;s past are based on facts and my own conclusions 
and speculations from the Casablanca manga special that came with the 
Kaguya special issue. A lot of what I talk about has its origin there. 
Of course, a lot of time has passed since then and now (it&#39;s easy to 
figure out that the Casablanca special took place shortly after Moon, 
Mercury, Mars and Jupiter got together), so that is why Rei&#39;s view has 
changed a little.
I hope I managed to portray the confusion in Rei&#39;s feelings 
believable. I find Manga-Rei a little harder to write than Anime-Rei 
in my honest opinion and really hope I managed to do so well enough.
A short note for everyone who happened to read the older version of 
part 1 and is now confused about this point (it really wasn&#39;t around 
long before I corrected this). Rei&#39;s grandfather in the manga isn&#39;t 
exactly the same as the perverted Happosei-clone in the anime. 
Actually he seems to be a regular old man judging from the Casablanca 
special and doesn&#39;t show up nearly as often as anime-grandpa does.

Err, if anyone wonders about the portal reference in the beginning at 
the fair... Go play BSSM Another Story... If I go around explaining 
all that now, it would take too long and it isn&#39;t really necessary to 
understand this story. Not at all actually.

So, Rei and Sasami are getting closer (am I doing a good job there?), 
Kagome and Sango are getting better. Only two people left to complete 
the &quot;Miko Sisters&quot; as you know them from Dusk already. So wait for the 
next part. I&#39;ve just got my admittance for university, starting 
October. I try to wrap at least the main portion of this side arc up 
until then. Can&#39;t promise anything though. So if you have to wait a 
little on this, it is most likely because Real Life claimed most of my 
time.

Feedback as always to the addy above, expected to come plentiful.

Ja ne, yours
