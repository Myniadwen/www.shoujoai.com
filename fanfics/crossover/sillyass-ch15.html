<h1>Silly Assed Utena X-Over Fic (part 15 of 21)</h1>

<a href="../crossover/sillyass-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>&quot;Ahhhhhhhhhh!&quot; Shinji wailed as he ran across the crowded campus. 
Right behind him Asuka was starting to catch up, waving an 
impressively large mallet around. Oddly, she was only wearing a 
hastily thrown on robe to cover her various assets.

&quot;You are so going to pay for sneaking in to watch me and Rei,&quot; Asuka 
growled, a swing nearly taking Shinji&#39;s head off.

&quot;Don&#39;t kill me, I&#39;m still a virgin,&quot; Shinji wailed.

Watching them run by Anthy made a face, &quot;Eww! Too much information.&quot;

Utena looked a bit green upon hearing that as well, &quot;Oh, yeah.&quot; She 
sighed softly, &quot;But still...&quot;

Asuka skidded to a sudden halt as Utena stepped into her path, arms 
spread. Shinji, seeing an opportunity for continued survival, quickly 
hid behind her.

&quot;Get out of the way, Tenjou,&quot; Asuka said dangerously.

&quot;I can&#39;t let you kill someone who&#39;s smaller and weaker than you,&quot; 
Utena said patiently, &quot;it wouldn&#39;t be honorable.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, what she said,&quot; Shinji said desperately.

&quot;Shut up or I&#39;ll beat you to death myself,&quot; Utena looked down at him 
ominously.

&quot;Shutting up,&quot; Shinji squeaked.

Asuka leaned the mallet up against a tree as she considered Utena&#39;s 
argument. &quot;You might have a point,&quot; she mused.

&quot;I&#39;ve got a solution,&quot; a smiling Rei caught up with them wearing a EVA 
uniform with a few carefully cut holes in it and nothing else.

&quot;Rei,&quot; Asuka blushed, &quot;I&#39;ve told you not to wear that in public.&quot;

&quot;But Asuka,&quot; Rei batted her eyes kawaiily.

A sweatdropping Utena tentatively asked the pale EVA pilot, &quot;You said 
that you had a solution to the problem?&quot;

&quot;Oh, right,&quot; Rei bounced happily, &quot;why not let them fight it out in 
their EVAs? That way, they&#39;ll be physically equal when Asuka beats him 
up.&quot;

&quot;That seems fair,&quot; Anthy nodded.

&quot;Good idea,&quot; Utena agreed.

Shinji tried to run for his life once again but Utena&#39;s outstretched 
foot quickly brought him down to Earth. Asuka grabbed one leg, Rei the 
other, and they proceeded to drag him off.

&quot;I&#39;m too young to die,&quot; Shinji sobbed.

&quot;Take it like a man,&quot; Asuka grumbled.

&quot;Or at least more like a woman,&quot; Rei smirked.

Not long afterward, they stood in their massive EVAs, a deserted field 
chosen to be their battleground. Well, deserted except for the stands 
someone had set up along on one side of the field, full of cheering 
students.

&quot;Would you like to share my popcorn?&quot; Ami asked Juri with a beaming 
smile.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Juri smiled, munching happily. &quot;Looks like Asuka&#39;s going to 
win this one easily,&quot; she noted, offering Ami some of her drink.

Haruka leaned forward, &quot;Even if Shinji goes bezerk?&quot;

Michiru tugged her back gently, &quot;Asuka&#39;s just too good a fighter.&quot; She 
looked over at Haruka suspiciously, &quot;Nabiki didn&#39;t talk you into 
betting on him, did she?&quot;

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Haruka admitted with a sigh.

Michiru shook her head, &quot;You never learn, do you?&quot;

Rei&#39;s EVA 00 raised it&#39;s arm, &quot;Ready?&quot; There was a extended pause then 
she threw her arm down and cried, &quot;Fight!&quot;

Shinji&#39;s EVA 01 pulled the knife from it&#39;s shoulder harness, crouching 
for battle. &quot;Bring it on,&quot; he said, trying to sound confident.

&quot;Ready for a surprise?&quot; Asuka&#39;s voice was silkily dangerous.

Shinji gulped, a sinking feeling rushing over him.

&quot;Twin buster rifles,&quot; Asuka pulled the two energy weapons out from 
behind her, &quot;Fire!&quot;

A massive stream of destructive energy poured out at Shinji&#39;s EVA. In 
a few seconds, the massive robot lay in a smoking heap on the ground, 
the bolts having cut it into pieces.

&quot;I wondered where those went off of the Wing Zero,&quot; Heero Yui noted.

&quot;You going to argue with her?&quot; Duo Maxwell asked impishly.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Heero sighed.

&quot;Do you think we&#39;re going to be the ones who have to fix that?&#39; Maya 
Ibiki sighed softly, looking up at her boss.

Ritsuko shrugged, &quot;Probably.&quot; The tall blonde leaned down to her dark 
haired companion, &quot;Look on the bright side.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Maya squeaked nervously.

Ritsuko smiled impishly, &quot;We can spend more time together alone.&quot;

&quot;Sempai?&quot; Maya blushed furiously.

Ritsuko&#39;s voice dropped to a sexy purr as she almost whispered in 
Maya&#39;s ear, &quot;You&#39;re so cute when you blush, you know that?&quot;

Maya&#39;s eyes grew wider, her face went an even darker red if that was 
possible, then she simply fell over in a dead faint.

&quot;Poor thing,&quot; Ritsuko sighed. A mischievous smile appeared on her 
face, and she quickly put Maya over her shoulder.

&quot;Where do you think you&#39;re going with her?&quot; Misato asked, pushing her 
black hair back from her face irritably.

&quot;I&#39;m taking her home to give some TLC,&quot; Ritsuko beamed.

Misato shook her head, &quot;Just don&#39;t tie the poor girl down to the bed 
again. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s still carrying psychological scars from the last 
time you did that.&quot;

Ritsuko pouted, &quot;Spoil sport.&quot;

Appearing this Episode: Utena, Anthy and Juri are from Revolutionary 
Girl Utena. Shinji, Asuka, Rei, Misato, Ritsuko and Maya are from Neon 
Genesis Evangelion. Ami, Haruka and Michiru are from Sailor Moon. And
