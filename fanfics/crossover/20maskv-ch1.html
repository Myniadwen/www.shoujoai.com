<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Note: this is an alternate universe fic
featuring characters and concepts from both Sailor
Moon and the manga series Twenty Masks. I don&#39;t own
any of the characters, I&#39;m just borrowing them for a
while. This is also a shoujoai (girl/girl) romance, so
if you don&#39;t like that sort of thing, stay away.

The Twenty Masks of Sailor V!

Natsuna Sakurada gave the costumed woman a amused
smile as the older woman read from the paper, &quot;The
costumed adventurer Sailor V is confident she will
quickly capture the mysterious thief.&quot; The brown
haired police officer set the paper she had been
quoting from aside as she asked, &quot;You didn&#39;t really
tell her that?&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Sailor V sighed irritably, the
younger blonde girl sitting on the other side of the
desk by the window, &quot;I have no idea where she got that
quote from.&quot; She leaned forward, long blonde hair
falling in front of the lenses of the simple mask she
wore as she asked with an eager smile, &quot;So tell me
about this problem thief of yours.&quot;

Natsuna handed the file over as she said, &quot;The thief
has picked up the nickname Twenty Masks, mostly due to
the use of disguises. Has hit seven museums and other
events, stealing one valuable item then slipping away
each time.&quot;

&quot;Not bad,&quot; Sailor V acknowledged as she browsed
through the papers, &quot;but I&#39;m not sure why you wanted
me to get involved.&quot;

&quot;Before every robbery,&quot; Natsuna said, looking very
annoyed, &quot;this Twenty Masks has sent us a warning that
he was going to strike. We&#39;ve deployed dozens of
officers and the best security, but each time he&#39;s
pulled off the robbery.&quot;

&quot;Leaving the police with egg on their faces,&quot; Sailor V
nodded. She came across a photo then made a face, &quot;No
better images?&quot;

The figure in the blurred security photo was turning
even as the camera went off, the body slightly blurred
by motion. It was hard to pick out details but it
almost looked like he was wearing a black tuxedo, a
long cape swirling around the slim body. A simple mask
covered the eyes, a top hat perched atop a remarkably
delicate face.

&quot;Normally Twenty Masks is more thorough,&quot; Natsuna
admitted, &quot;we think he missed this camera, destroying
it only after the photo was taken.&quot;

&quot;She,&quot; Sailor V murmured as she studied the image.

&quot;What?&quot; Natsuna leaned forward, looking at the image
in surprise.

Silently Sailor V pointed to the slight curve visible
on the chest, the proportions of the body. &quot;The
clothes are padded, but it&#39;s still visible. Do you
think you can get this enhanced, maybe?&quot; she asked,
handing it back to Natsuna.

&quot;I&#39;ll pass it on to Doctor Mizuno down in forensics,&quot;
Natsuna took it back as she continued, &quot;Ami might be
able to get some more details out of it.&quot;

&quot;Did you have fun at Ami and Makoto&#39;s bridal shower?&quot;
Sailor V asked impishly.

&quot;Actually, yes,&quot; Natsuna chuckled softly, not at all
surprised that Sailor V knew about it. She slid the
photo away before adding, &quot;And there&#39;s another unusual
detail in this case, it looks like Twenty Masks is
targeting a specific individual.&quot;

Sailor V looked at her curiously, &quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;All the items that have been stolen have belonged to
a wealthy young woman named Hotaru Tomoe,&quot; Natsuna
said simply.

&quot;She&#39;s the daughter of Professor Tomoe,&quot; Sailor V
instantly recognized the name as she worked to recall
the articles she had once read, &quot;she&#39;s a patron of the
arts, having leant items to various museums and
special events around the city.&quot; Sailor V looked at
Natsuna thoughtfully as she asked, &quot;You&#39;ve interviewed
her about this, of course?&quot;

&quot;The young lady has no idea why Twenty Masks would be
targeting her,&quot; Natsuna said then admitted, &quot;I think
Hotaru&#39;s not telling the truth, but I&#39;m not quite sure
about what or why.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll look into that,&quot; Sailor V flashed a smile. She
had reason to trust in Natsuna&#39;s detective instincts,
they had helped her discover her true identity of
Minako Aino, after all. &quot;Any other galleries or
museums with items belonging to Ms. Tomoe?&quot; Sailor V
asked.

&quot;She&#39;s making a public presentation to the Cultural
Center tomorrow,&quot; Natsuna said as she passed over an
invitation, &quot;I arranged to get an extra one just in
case.&quot;

&quot;As sharp as ever,&quot; Sailor V said with a grin.

With a bit of a flush to her cheeks Natsuna turned to
the filing cabinet on one side of the office, getting
some still warm tea from the thermos atop it. &quot;I was
wondering if you...&quot; she started to say as she turned
back, only to stop cold.

The chair Sailor V had sat in was empty, the small
room dead silent. Natsuna rushed over to the now open
window to look out at the night, the full moon shining
down on the city. For just a moment one of her
powerful leaps brought Sailor V into Natsuna&#39;s line of
sight, the blonde beauty a shadow against the moon,
then she was gone.

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Natsuna shook her head with a smile
before getting back to work.

Sailor V dropped to a roof, scooping up the white
shape waiting there before leaping off again. &quot;You
heard?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Every word,&quot; Artemis answered, the little white cat
clasped close to her. &quot;It doesn&#39;t feel Negaverse
related,&quot; he said, &quot;I think it may just be a ordinary
robber.&quot;

&quot;Nice for a change,&quot; Sailor V said dryly. &quot;So I&#39;m
going to the unveiling, what sort of face do you think
I should wear?&quot;

&quot;Oof,&quot; Artemis puffed out as they hit a roof then were
launched into the air again. &quot;The young socialite, I
think,&quot; he said, &quot;just drop that annoying laugh you
used last time.&quot;

&quot;Aww,&quot; Sailor V pouted then laughed much more
normally.

The city was still dark as Sailor V reached the
mansion, the young blonde moving carefully on the
balcony. The house was in one of the best parts of
town, a sprawling building that suited the prestige
and wealth of the Tomoe family.

&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; a figure called, the silhouette moving
to the balcony doors. She was young, early teens, with
short black hair framing a pretty face. She saw who
was standing outside and her eyes widened, &quot;:Sailor
V!&quot;

&quot;Miss Tomoe,&quot; Sailor V nodded. &#39;How did she know I was
here?&#39; she wondered, &#39;I was nearly silent.&#39; Aloud she
said, &quot;I hoped that you would speak to me, tonight.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Hotaru Tomoe stepped closer, the
nightgown she wore fluttering around her.

Sailor V blushed slightly, looking away from the
girl&#39;s near nudity. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to interrupt your
sleep,&quot; she murmured.

&quot;I was just thinking about tomorrow,&quot; Hotaru shook her
head. She smiled at Sailor V, her delicate perfume
carried by the breeze, &quot;How can I help you?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve been targeted by the thief Twenty Masks,&quot;
Sailor V made herself concentrate on her work, &quot;but do
you know why?&quot;

Hotaru shook her head, closing those striking violet
eyes as she said, &quot;I have no idea why this criminal
would be interested in me.&quot;

&#39;She&#39;s lying,&#39; Sailor V realized, &#39;but why?&#39; She moved
away, putting a hand on the rail of the balcony, &quot;I&#39;ll
be watching over things, tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Wait....&quot; Hotaru started but Sailor V was gone, the
blonde disappearing into the darkness.

&quot;That&#39;s interesting,&quot; Artemis muttered once she picked
him up from his nearby hiding place.

A faint blush colored Sailor V&#39;s cheeks as she thought
of the surprisingly pretty young woman, &quot;Yes, it was.&quot;

The next day was cloudy, the summer sun struggling to
burn through the misty cover. There were security
guards stationed all around the Cultural Center, some
in plain clothes the others dressed in uniform to make
a robber hesitate. Minako Aino spotted them all, of
course, but she didn&#39;t think they&#39;d get much use
today.

&#39;This is far too public for Twenty Masks,&#39; the young
woman also known as Sailor V thought, &#39;she seems to
prefer the shadows.&#39; Minako showed the pass to a guard
stationed by the gate, one who checked it and her over
carefully. The blue party dress hugged her slim body,
the low cut top boldly highlighting her cleavage and
the high skirt showing off nice legs.

&quot;Go on in, miss,&quot; the black haired man said with a nod
and a soft gulp.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Minako answered with a wicked smile as she
moved in through the front gate.

The Cultural Center was a newer building, one that was
constructed more in a western style, a square, blocky
shape in concrete. There were stone steps leading up
to the entrance, a large porch extending out ten feet
before the doors. On that porch the presentation was
going to be happening, a band of older officials and a
black haired young lady standing beside a drape
covered object.

Hotaru Tomoe was dressed somberly, the black dress
fitting her nicely. Her short black hair framed a
delicate face, pale skin vivid on black. Her face was
serious as she listened to the officials talk away,
then she frowned slightly. Almost as if she felt
Minako&#39;s eyes on her Hotaru turned to zero in on her,
the girl&#39;s eyes meeting Minako&#39;s.

&#39;Those violet eyes again,&#39; Minako thought in surprise,
&#39;I wonder if that&#39;s her natural color or contacts?&quot;
They stood there for a long moment, each silently
gazing at the other, then Hotaru turned away to talk
to the representatives of the city.

Using her charm and a warm smile Minako smoothly made
her way forward through the crowd of guests and the
press, waiting not far from where the presentation was
going to take place. With some amusement she
recognized several of the plain clothed officers in
the press of people, and up on the stage Natsuna kept
a wary eye out.

&#39;Natsuna looks so good in a suit,&#39; Sailor V noted, &#39;I
almost wish....&#39; then she shook her head. Minako and
her had met back in London, when Natsuna had pursued
Sailor V thinking she was a criminal, but eventually
they had become allies. There even had been some
flirting there, but in the end the age difference
between them had gotten in the way. &#39;Not to mention
Natsuna falling in love with someone else,&#39; she
thought.

All the speech making was pretty boring, the
representatives of the Cultural Center almost too
overdone in their praise of Miss Tomoe, then the
various city politicians who were looking for votes
took a turn. Hotaru herself kept her comments short
and to the point, thanking the city and it&#39;s people
for supporting the Center then moving on to the
unveiling.

The oldest man on the stage took the drape in his
hands and pulled, then a soft gasp of surprise and
alarm rang out. The sculpture itself was remarkable, a
lovely image of the goddess Venus, but what really
drew attention was the note that someone had attached
to the bare breasts.

&quot;The Venus will be mine by midnight,&quot; the note read,
signed at the bottom, &quot;Twenty Masks.&quot;

The police around the sculpture went mad as they
scurried around looking for how Twenty Masks had
gained access and Natsuna glared around intensely. The
politicians and officials had a fit but oddly Hotaru
stood calmly, speaking reassuringly as they all
panicked.

It took Minako a few moments to reach Natsuna&#39;s side,
the officer subtlety waiting for her to make contact.
&quot;Obviously Twenty Masks got here long before the
unveiling to add that note,&quot; Natsuna murmured to her
quietly.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Minako agreed, &quot;you can dust the note for
fingerprints, but I doubt you&#39;ll get anything. Twenty
Masks has been too careful so far, I doubt she&#39;d screw
up like that.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll try anyway,&quot; Natsuna answered, &quot;so what will
you do now?&quot;

&quot;Stand guard tonight,&quot; Minako shrugged, &quot;the note
gives me two reasons.&quot;

&quot;Two?&quot; Natsuna blinked.

&quot;There&#39;s the challenge that the note represents,&quot;
Minako answered, &quot;and there&#39;s one other thing: Sailor
V stands for Venus.&quot; With that Minako slipped away as
silently as she came.

Hotaru Tomoe made her way over to Natsuna, the grave
young woman looking up at the older officer. &quot;Who was
that young woman?&quot; she asked, seemingly casual.

Natsuna lied smoothly, hiding her surprise that Hotaru
had been attentive enough to see them talking
together, &quot;One of my undercover officers, though I&#39;m
sorry to say I can&#39;t mention her name.&quot;

Hotaru gazed off into the crowd where Minako had
disappeared, her expression thoughtful. &quot;Thank you,
officer,&quot; she smiled politely then turned back to the
anxious politicians.

&quot;Miss Tomoe, what are we going to do?&quot; the curator of
the museum bleated.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Hotaru smoothly reassured them, &quot;I&#39;m
sure that Sailor V will stop that awful criminal.&quot;

&#39;Well, isn&#39;t that an interesting comment to make,&#39;
Natsuna thought before the officer returned to the
demands of her work.

The day passed by quickly, the sun fading away as
police were stationed around the Center. Several
police cars were parked in front, uniformed officers
patrolled the grounds and powerful spotlights swept
across the darkness. At the unofficial command post by
one of the patrol cars Natsuna sipped her cup of tea,
wondering what was going to happen.

&quot;Not bad,&quot; Sailor V seemed to drop right out of the
sky, landing smoothly by her side.

Natsuna looked cross, &quot;How do you do that?&quot;

Sailor V flashed her a grin, &quot;Professional secret.&quot;
She set Artemis down on the hood of the car as she
continued, &quot;Pass on any relevant information, I&#39;ll
check the place out.&quot; With that she was off,
disappearing into the shadows.

&quot;Hi,&quot; Artemis gave Natsuna a sheepish smile, the white
cat looking mildly embarrassed at being dumped there
with the officer.

Sailor V perched on a lamp post then rose, the skirt
of her sailor fuku blowing gently in the breeze as she
took in the scene. &#39;The problem with police is,&#39; she
thought, reaching out to touch a whisper thin line
that stretched from a nearby building to the Cultural
Center, &#39;they never look up.&#39; Using the line and the
right equipment access to the center would be terribly
easy. As fast as possible she bounded to the roof of
the building only to freeze, gazing at what awaited
her.

&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for you,&quot; Twenty Masks said calmly,
her voice warm as she sat on the roof, a thermos
sitting there beside her. She had taken out the
padding from the suit, the curve of breasts and hips
now clearly visible under the black cloth. Beside her
two cups steamed, the rich scent of hot cocoa carried
by the breeze.

&quot;You&#39;re awfully casual about being caught,&quot; Sailor V
said, her body tensed and ready for any move her foe
might make.

&quot;I&#39;ve accomplished what I set out to do,&quot; Twenty Masks
said simply. She held out one of the cups, &quot;Would you
like some?&quot;

Sailor V walked closer, the better to strike if she
needed to. &quot;And what did you want to do?&quot; she asked,
taking the cup with a wary smile.

Twenty Masks took her hat off, short black hair
swinging free. &quot;Trying to meet you, of course,&quot; she
said with a shrug.

&quot;What?&quot; Sailor V blinked.

&quot;You aren&#39;t the easiest woman to contact,&quot; Twenty
Masks flashed a smile, &quot;so I needed to find a way to
get your attention.&quot;

&quot;But why did you target someone like Hotaru....&quot;
Sailor V trailed off as it hit her suddenly, the
pieces falling into place. &quot;Of course,&quot; she murmured,
eyes narrowing.

Twenty Masks reached up to remove her mask, those
violet eyes now twinkling with honest amusement. &quot;I
thought you&#39;d get it,&quot; Hotaru smiled, sipping her own
cocoa. She smoothly rose, &quot;I intend to return all the
items to the museums, of course.&quot;

&quot;Why did you want to contact me?&quot; Sailor V demanded,
trying to ignore the sudden racing of her heart. &#39;I
always liked a woman in a suit,&#39; she thought.

Hotaru set the cup down on the roof, moving with an
almost unearthly grace. &quot;I don&#39;t know if someone can
really fall in love at first sight,&quot; Hotaru suddenly
stepped close, &quot;but I think it happened to me the
first time that I saw you.&quot; With that she pressed her
lips to the startled Sailor V&#39;s, swiftly drawing her
into a lingering kiss.

&quot;What?!&quot; Sailor V blurted, pulling back once the kiss
ended.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Artemis demanded into her ear, the
communications device she wore keeping them in
constant contact.

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe me if I told you,&quot; Sailor V
muttered.

Hotaru stepped back, smiling up at her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry if
I&#39;m too forward,&quot; she said softly, &quot;but I&#39;ve wanted to
do that for so long.&quot;

&quot;Gah,&quot; Sailor V shook her head, trying to clear it.
&quot;You can&#39;t be in love with me,&quot; she tried to be
reasonable, &quot;you don&#39;t even know me.&quot;

Hotaru put her hand on Sailor V&#39;s shoulder, looking up
at her with those oddly bottomless eyes. &quot;I&#39;d love to
get to know you better,&quot; she said simply.

&quot;Oh, boy,&quot; Sailor V whimpered.

Epilogue

The criminal known as Twenty Masks made her last
appearance that very night, Hotaru quite willingly
choosing to retire that identity. Sailor V swiftly
brokered a deal between Hotaru and Natsuna, closing
the case without bringing too much publicity to either
the police force or the Tomoe family. Over time Hotaru
won Sailor V over, both in her civilian identity and
as Sailor V&#39;s new partner in crime fighting.... the
mysterious Sailor Saturn.
