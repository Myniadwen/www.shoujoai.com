<a href="../crossover/shadowcat-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>        Kitty had to smile slightly as Yomiko beamed at her, &quot;I&#39;ll let 
our pilot know we&#39;re aboard, we&#39;ll take off almost immediately.&quot;

        &quot;Got it,&quot; Kitty grabbed a seat, smoothly belting herself in. 
For a moment she remembered piloting the Blackbird, but she quickly 
surpressed the feeling. This wasn&#39;t one of the jets she was used to, 
and explaining how she was qualified would take far too long.

        The plane shook slightly as it taxied down the runway, then 
the vibration eased off as they rose up into the air. With the 
casualness that came from long practice Drake made his way up the 
aisle carrying a thermos and a tea cup. &quot;Knowing Yomiko she hauled you 
off without giving you a chance to eat,&quot; the burly blonde smiled 
slightly, &quot;would you like some tea?&quot;

        &quot;Please,&quot; Kitty smiled up at him. He sat the cup down, 
unscrewed the thermos and the poured it into the cup without spilling 
a drop. She raised it to her lips, taking a moment to savor the scent, 
then she hesitated.

        &quot;Is something wrong?&#39; Drake asked.

        &#39;I know what&#39;s in this,&#39; Kitty thought to herself grimly. 
Making an instant decision she drank it down in one gulp, then held 
out the cup, &quot;More.&quot;

        &quot;Wha..&quot; Drake gaped at her.

        &quot;One cup isn&#39;t going to put me out, Mr. Anderson,&quot; Kitty 
ordered him crisply. He topped up the glass and Kitty quickly drank 
that one down too.

        Yomiko was returning to the cabin as the cup slid from Kitty&#39;s 
nerveless fingers to fall to the floor. &quot;Drake-san,&quot; Yomiko cried out 
worriedly, &quot;What did you...&quot;

        Kitty didn&#39;t hear the rest, the darkness rising up to engulf 
her.

        Some unknown amount of time passed before Kitty awoke once 
again. The bitter scent of ammonia dragged her out of pleasant dreams 
and back to wakefulness. She warily opened up her eyes to find a blond 
haired man in a tailored suit looking over her worriedly as she lay 
there on a long couch, in the middle of an old fashioned office.

        &quot;It&#39;s good to see you awake at last,&quot; he smiled, walking over 
to pick up a antique phone. He pressed a switch, &quot;Wendy? Could you 
bring in two cups of tea and biscuits for our guest, it would be 
greatly appreciated.&quot;

        Kitty sat up a bit uncomfortably, &quot;I assume that your 
organization was able to check me out while I was still unconscious?&quot;

        &quot;Indeed,&quot; he nodded. He smiled slightly, &quot;Thank you very much 
for cooperating with our Mr. Anderson when he drugged you.&quot;

        &quot;Once I realized he wanted to, it seemed to be the quickest 
way to get in here and get some answers,&quot; Kitty answered him simply. 
She shook her head, trying to clear out the last cobwebs and asked, 
&quot;So what should I call you?&quot;

        &quot;Joker,&quot; he bowed slightly. The door was opened, and a young 
woman with long, blonde hair came in, carefully carrying in a tray and 
biscuits. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he turned and smiled, &quot;you can set it down on 
the desk.&quot;

        &quot;Hai,&quot; Wendy smiled happily.

        &quot;Could you go get the files on Nancy Mukahari?&quot; Joker asked 
cheerfully.

        &quot;Right,&quot; Wendy turned to leave, but as she was stepping out 
the door her foot caught on a rug and she fell forward with a loud 
cry, the door thumping shut behind her.

        &quot;Is she all right?&quot; Kitty asked, half out of her chair to go 
help her.

        Joker sighed, &quot;She&#39;s fine, she does that all the time.&quot; He 
poured out tea for himself, then her as he explained, &quot;We were 
concerned that you might simply be another clone, part of a second 
attempt to infiltrate our organization.&quot;

        Kitty picked up the cup, a single breath confirming that it 
was clean. &quot;You checked for any genetic drift, one of the sure signs 
of cloning, right, Joker-san?&quot; she remarked as she took a drink.

        &quot;You were clean,&quot; an oddly smiling Joker remarked as he took 
another drink. He hesitated, &quot;I&#39;m curious, how did you know what Drake 
was doing?&quot;

        &quot;The sedative you used was a very good one,&quot; Kitty picked up a 
biscuit and nibbled on it, &quot;but there is a slight scent to it, 
especially when combined with something hot. You&#39;d have to be pretty 
well trained to pick it up, though.&quot;

        &quot;A leftover from your training under &#39;Ogun,&quot; Joker speculated, 
drinking a bit more of his own tea. He set it down in it&#39;s saucer, 
&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re so well trained, we may need your help.&quot;

        &quot;Wait, you can&#39;t go in there,&quot; they heard a bit of what 
sounded like an argument from out in the hallway. The door to the 
office suddenly burst open, two female figures tumbling to the ground 
and a pile of papers were sent flying. Kitty jumped up to her feet, 
Joker right behind her, then they both relaxed once they saw who it 
was.

        Yomiko pulled herself to her feet, awkwardly helping Wendy up, 
too. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Joker-san,&quot; she nodded to him then she turned to look 
earnestly up at Kitty, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Kitty-san. I had no idea that 
Drake was going to do that to you!&quot;

        Kitty gently put her hand on the anxious young woman&#39;s 
shoulder and smiled, &quot;It&#39;s all right, Yomiko. I knew what Drake was 
doing, and I let him.&quot;

        Yomiko blinked in surprise, &quot;But why, Kitty-san?&quot;

        &quot;Otherwise you would have had to knock me out some other way, 
or find some method of blindfolding me before you could bring me here, 
to your headquarters,&quot; Kitty said gently. She found herself 
remembering the lengths the X-Men had once had to go to when keeping 
the Mansion a secret, and decided she could forgive being drugged.

        &quot;You&#39;re not angry?&quot; Yomiko asked her anxiously. When Kitty 
shook her head no Yomiko smiled, her eyes glittering with tears, &quot;I&#39;m 
so glad!&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s so sweet,&quot; Wendy sighed to herself happily even as she 
finished sorting out the large pile of papers once again.

        Kitty looked up at Joker curiously, &quot;So can you tell me where 
we are?&quot; She took a breath and smiled slightly, &quot;Though the scent 
tells me we&#39;re in a library.&quot;

        Joker smiled slightly, &quot;Are you certain you don&#39;t share the 
abilities of your colleague, Logan? Yes, we&#39;re beneath the Tokyo 
branch of the British Library.&quot;

        Kitty&#39;s eyes widened just slightly, &quot;The Great British Library 
Special Missions Agency.&quot;

        All three people in the room looked at her in mild surprise. 
&quot;You&#39;ve heard of us?&quot; Yomiko finally managed to ask.

        &quot;You mentioned Logan,&quot; Kitty nodded to Joker, &quot;he had a run in 
with one of your agents a few years back in Madripoor, while he was 
trying to recover a lost book.&quot;

        &quot;You might want to ask Mr. Anderson about that,&quot; Joker smiled 
slightly.

        Kitty chuckled, drinking a bit more of her tea. &quot;I should have 
guessed,&quot; she agreed.

        A few moments later Yomiko was sitting at Kitty&#39;s side as 
Joker reviewed the documents. &quot;The genetic matching has come in,&quot; he 
read, &quot;and Kitty has been confirmed as the single donor of genetic 
material for Nancy Mukahari.&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Kitty blinked in surprise as she sat forward, &quot;but 
what about the claim that her DNA had come from Mata Hari?&quot;

        &quot;The differences between you seem to be mostly cosmetic,&quot; 
Joker noted, &quot;she was likely told that to help keep her under Ujin&#39;s 
control.&quot;

        &quot;You and Nancy have the same DNA?&quot; Yomiko murmured, the oddest 
look on her face.

        &quot;The record we had on Nancy was mostly fictional,&quot; Joker 
admitted, &quot;but we are aware that she traveled in Europe and Japan 
before we first encountered her.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;ve already got your people tracing her movements back,&quot; 
Kitty said thoughtfully. Joker nodded as she sipped some tea, &quot;You 
might want to keep an eye on certain names, like Nathan Essex or Mr. 
Sinister.&quot;

        &quot;Sinister-san?&quot; Yomiko echoed.

        Kitty smiled slightly at how Yomiko put that. &quot;He&#39;s a 
scientist and geneticist whom the X-men tangled with a few times,&quot; she 
said, &quot;and he&#39;s an expert on cloning.&quot;

        &quot;You think he might have created Nancy and the others?&quot; Joker 
asked.

        &quot;To be honest,&quot; Kitty admitted, &quot;no, I don&#39;t. It&#39;s a little 
too obvious, in a way. But he&#39;s got the technology, and I wouldn&#39;t be 
surprised if he had my DNA, too.&quot;
