<h1>Night Angels (part 19 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ecoldiron.html">Elwin Blain Coldiron</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/niteangel-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>Irene &quot;Rally&quot; Vincent was on a hunt. Stalking through the tropical 
vegetation on the island of Roanapur, she had all her vampiric senses in 
overdrive, ever mindful of an ambush by Natasha Radinov, her quarry. 
Every once in a while, she would find a blood-stained leaf, which 
brought her ever so closer to her target.

But as she paused to gain her bearings, a look of concern came over her 
face. &#39;I&#39;ve got to admit, I used-up a lot of energy punching out that 
bitch before she could use that holy water on Master,&#39; she thought of 
herself. &#39;I could&#39;ve taken more blood from Moria, but that would&#39;ve 
meant killing her and making her my fledgling... something I&#39;m not sure 
she&#39;s ready for yet!&#39; She then frowned, remembering how the maid Moria 
Hedgley had unselfishly gave her the blood to recover. &#39;Moria... that&#39;s 
another thing Radinov owes me! But if I&#39;m going to get her, I&#39;m going to 
need a fresh infusion of blood... and soon.&#39; Catching sight of another 
bloody leaf, she continued her pursuit.

Ahead of Rally, Radinov stopped to catch her breath, as well as examine 
herself. Much of the bullets that Revy had shot her with were blocked by 
the bulletproof coat she wore. However, a good number of them found 
their mark in places that were exposed - and those injuries were not 
healing! &quot;Damn!&quot; she snarled, &quot;I should&#39;ve recovered about now, but 
these wounds are still fresh! There must be something about those 
bullets that pirate hit me with!&quot; Her attention was then diverted to a 
rustling ahead of her. &quot;WHO&#39;S THERE?&quot; she commanded, drawing an Uzi from 
her coat.

&quot;Calm down, Natasha... it&#39;s me!&quot; Hueng said, who was shocked about the 
injuries his friend suffered. &quot;What happened - and why aren&#39;t they 
healing?&quot;

&quot;Exactly the same thing I&#39;m wondering, Hueng,&quot; Radinov said ruefully. 
&quot;Listen, whatever you do, try not to let yourself be discovered!&quot; She 
then limped away, occasionally stumbling.

However, the slightly-built man could only look in pity, then returned 
to his place of concealment, where he had the iron spear Hueng brought 
from his wreaked shop - and just in time, for then he saw Rally break 
through the brush. &#39;You gave me so much, Natasha,&#39; he thought to 
himself, &#39;and now it&#39;s time I&#39;ve paid you back for all you did!&#39;

Rally, unaware of Hueng&#39;s presence, just happened to see her quarry move 
away. &quot;YOU&#39;RE NOT GETTING AWAY FROM ME THIS TIME, RADINOV!! I&#39;M GOING TO 
RIP YOUR HEAD OFF!!&quot; she yelled, sprinting towards her.

&quot;NO YOU DON&#39;T!!&quot; Hueng screamed, bursting out of the brush and plunging 
the spear deep into Rally&#39;s stomach.

Radinov spun around, seeing to her horror that her friend had attacked 
Rally, the brass head of the spear deep inside her gut. For an instant, 
it looked as if it was a success: Rally&#39;s face looked as if she was in 
pain. Then the grimace changed into a wicked grin, Rally grabbing Hueng 
by his shirt. &quot;Got to admit, it was a nice try. If only you used a 
sharpened bamboo stick and aimed for the heart, then MAYBE you might 
have been successful!&quot; Securing her grip on Hueng, Rally then pulled the 
spear out, the wound sealing itself as it did.

&quot;No... LET HIM GO, RALLY VINCENT!!&quot; Somehow, Radinov had found the 
strength to close the distance between herself and the two. But before 
she could grab her only friend from the vampire&#39;s clutches, Rally had 
swiftly levitated, carrying her squirming cargo with her, finally 
hovering out of reach. &quot;You bitch!&quot; she snarled, &quot;Come down here and let 
him go!&quot;

&quot;Sorry Radinov,&quot; Rally smirked, &quot;but I want you to find-out how I felt 
seeing someone you care about in danger!&quot; She then coldly looked down at 
Radinov, who could only look-up helplessly at her and Hueng. &quot;You know, 
if you really like to prove yourself as a vampire, then why don&#39;t you 
float-up here and take him?&quot;

&quot;I... I...&quot; Radinov stammered, wondering how in the world she could fly 
up to save Hueng.

&quot;You can&#39;t fly, can you?&quot; Rally&#39;s grin returned. &quot;Okay, how about you 
jump up here? Even with those wounds Revy gave you, I&#39;m certain you can 
make it!&quot;

Off to behind the three, their location securely assured, Revy and Seras 
Victoria simply watched. &quot;Geez,&quot; the pirate grumbled, &quot;what the fuck are 
they doing just standing around? I&#39;ve gone all this way for one hell of 
a fight and all I&#39;m getting is some fucking gab session... although that 
flying bit she&#39;s doing is something.&quot;

&quot;Will you keep your voice down?&quot; the Draculina hissed. &quot;I don&#39;t want our 
location revealed by that bitch Radinov.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah, just keep those big tits of yours in your shirt, willya?&quot; 
Revy irritably said. &quot;Besides, we still got that other asshole to worry 
about,&quot; jerking a thumb backwards. &quot;Got any idea who he is?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm... now that you&#39;ve mentioned it,&quot; Seras began, &quot;it would be a good 
opportunity to find out.&quot; She turned her attention to their mysterious 
spectator, who had been following them at a distance. At first, Seras 
had a little trouble trying to get a clear sight of him; he was 
carefully camouflaged within the vegetation. Then deciding to use her 
&#39;third eye&#39; she was able to peel back the offending cover - which caused 
her insides to twist as a result. &quot;Oh my god!?&quot; she gasped.

&quot;You saw something?&quot; Revy asked, noticing that Seras was trembling.

&quot;It can&#39;t be... it simply can&#39;t! Why in the world would HE be here?&quot; was 
all Seras said.

XXX

Deciding to take a chance, Radinov fought against the pain in her legs 
as she crouched down and leapt at Rally and Hueng. Rally had to admit it 
was better than she thought; the FREAK assassin had ACTUALLY achieved 
the height needed to reach them. But as Radinov was about to grab Hueng, 
Rally had teleported away with her catch, materializing at another 
location in the air.

Radinov&#39;s eyes widened as what she appeared to be her friend dissolved 
away before she could reach him. And when she landed, her ankle twisted, 
causing her to fall down. Fighting the pain, she tried again, but 
couldn&#39;t get the leverage needed to launch herself again. And all 
through this, she heard a sound she never thought she would hear from 
Rally - a loud, almost evil-sounding laugh, which caused Hueng to cringe 
hearing it.

&quot;I have to admit, Radinov,&quot; Rally heartily said, &quot;you did good the first 
time around! Too bad about the landing though! And I think as a reward 
for that, I&#39;ll let you get a chance at me... but first, a little snack!&quot; 
She then forced Hueng around, eyeing the man hungrily.

&quot;No... don&#39;t you dare!&quot; Radinov warned, thinking about what weapon in 
her coat to use against her. She had lost the holy water Sister Yolanda 
given her and only had normal weapons.

Hueng, in the meantime, could only stare wide-eyed at Rally, who had an 
almost-maniacal look in her face. &quot;P-please, you have to do this!&quot; he 
begged. &quot;I-I only meant to protect Natasha! You don&#39;t have to kill me!&quot;

&quot;You know, you&#39;re right about that, little guy... I DON&#39;T have to kill 
you,&quot; Rally said. But then the glow in her eyes brightened as she added, 
&quot;HOWEVER... I&#39;VE GOT STANDING ORDERS TO THE CONTRARY!!&quot;, lunging forward 
and sinking her fangs into his neck!

&quot;HUENG... NOOOO!!&quot; Radinov stood helplessly as Rally fed upon Hueng, the 
man&#39;s legs kicking furiously in the air to get away, then relaxing as he 
died. Then once she finished, Rally plunged her right hand into his 
chest and pulled-out the heart, drained it of the remaining blood, then 
crushing the organ in her hand. Once finished, she dropped Hueng&#39;s body 
to the ground, licking the blood from her hand as she floated down a 
good distance away.

Almost numbly, Radinov walked over to the body of what was the only 
friend she had in the world. &quot;Oh Hueng... why didn&#39;t you just run?&quot; she 
whispered, a single bloody tear streaming from her right eye. After a 
few seconds, she returned her attention to Rally. &quot;You bitch,&quot; she 
snarled, pulling two Uzis from her coat, &quot;YOU&#39;LL PAY FOR THIS, YOU 
MURDERER!!&quot; She opened fire, perforating the dusky vampire thoroughly 
with bullets - only to see that, after the clips were spent, that the 
wounds healed instantly.

&quot;Is that all you got, Radinov?&quot; Rally growled as she glared at the 
assassin. &quot;You... are calling me a murderer... that&#39;s like the pot 
calling the kettle black! The last time we&#39;ve met, you told me you were 
the next evolution of a vampire, one without the defects. Too bad you 
didn&#39;t see that YOU were the one with the BIGGEST defect - and you only 
have to look in the mirror to see it!&quot;

&quot;GO TO HELL, RALLY VINCENT!!&quot; Radinov shrieked, this time producing a 
shotgun and firing. But this time, Rally&#39;s body exploded into a huge 
flock of bats, which instantly fluttered around her, scratching and 
biting her as they did. Desperate, Radinov blasted the air around her, 
hoping to hit at least one of the bats. But then the gun jammed, just 
around the time the bats coalesced into a single point, reforming into 
Rally as they did. In a last-ditch effort, Radinov grabbed the one 
weapon she knew she could depend on - her shooting knife, launching the 
blade into Rally&#39;s right shoulder. But before it made its target, Rally 
caught the blade, breaking it in her hands.

&quot;That was pathetic, Radinov,&quot; Rally sneered, dropping the pieces to the 
ground. By now, Radinov could see a new aspect to her enemy: the air 
around Rally seemed to grow colder than the surrounding area. The 
darkness around her also seemed to writhe and twist, as an almost-unholy 
aura had surrounded the vampire.

This was not lost on Revy, who just grinned seeing this from her vantage 
point. &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; the pirate said, grinning, &quot;now we&#39;re getting down to 
the good shit!&quot; Seras just ignored her, instead looking with concern 
about her servant - and the mysterious observer near them.

&quot;You keep saying that you&#39;ve become the ultimate vampire,&quot; Rally 
continued, her appearance changing as she talked; the nails of her 
fingers growing longer, as well as her dusky skin taking upon a light 
slate-gray shade. Even her hair began to grow, becoming as long as her 
body. &quot;And yet, you continue to fight like a human!&quot; Around Rally, 
several blood-red eyes appeared around the two women, converging around 
the transformed vampire. &quot;I made that same mistake the last time we 
fought and I got my ass kicked as a result - but not anymore! This time 
we&#39;re going to have this fight my way... AS VAMPIRES!!&quot;

Rally&#39;s body then ripped apart into a distended mass of shapes and 
shadows, pieces of her skin falling down and deteriorating like dried 
leaves. At once, dog-like shadows charged at Radinov, forcing the FREAK 
to reach for her remaining weapons. However, some of the shadows tore 
her coat away from Radinov, while one wolf-shadow clamped its jaws on 
her left arm, ripping it off at the shoulder and eating it. Another 
wolf-shadow produced Rally&#39;s shotgun Purgatory from its mouth, firing 
several slugs into Radinov and forcing her to retreat into the jungle. 
&quot;GO AHEAD AND RUN, RADINOV!!&quot; Rally&#39;s voice called-out, &quot;YOU WON&#39;T BE 
GETTING AWAY FROM ME ANYTIME SOON!!&quot; The shadow form then followed 
Radinov in.

&quot;Man-oh-man!&quot; Revy crowed as she left her concealment, &quot;now that is some 
fucking hard-core shit! C&#39;mon, I don&#39;t want to miss any more of it!&quot; She 
then raced in as well.

&quot;Revy, what are you doing?&quot; Seras called-out as she followed, &quot;Rally 
could be too dangerous in that form!&quot; She then threw-up her arms and 
grumbled, &quot;Oh bloody hell, why do I always get stuck with the idiots?&quot;

XXX

By now, as Radinov stumbled through the vegetation, her pain was growing 
by the second. Finally collapsing to her knees, she clutched the stump 
of her left arm, trying to staunch the bleeding. &quot;What is... what is 
happening to me?&quot; she gasped, then vomited up a quantity of blood. &quot;I&#39;m 
getting worst by the second! Why am I not healing?&quot;

&#39;Vhy indeed, Frauline Radinov?&#39; the voice of the Major pleasantly 
sounded in her head. In her mind&#39;s eye, Radinov could see the 
white-dressed form of the leader of Millennium, seating calmly in his 
chair while addressing her. &#39;This is a message that vas pre-programmed 
into the chip in the case of a fatal malfunction. Frauline, I vas 
vondering - did you, by any chance, absorb a large amount of mercury 
vithin your system recently? Oh pardon me, perhaps I should explain - 
this experiment vas to find out if the host of the new chip could 
possibly survive a huge infusion of mercury that makes-up the tips of 
much of the bullets used by the Hellsing Organization. Vell obviously 
the experiment vas a failure, vhich vould make the Doctor extremely 
unhappy, but then again, vhat&#39;s the loss anyway? You vere nothing but a 
stinking Bolshevik, so I doubt anyone vill miss you anytime.&#39;

&quot;Experiment?&quot; Radinov gasped, horrified. &quot;I was only... an experiment?&quot;

&#39;Frauline Radinov, you have Millennium&#39;s eternal gratitude, but I&#39;m 
afraid you are now no longer of any use to us, since the chip you were 
assigned to retrieve will not be duplicated. But I vouldn&#39;t vorry about 
you last minutes on Earth to be a painful one, as we will be activating 
the self-destruction feature, vhich will reduce your body to ashes. 
Vell, it vas nice of you to add your service to us, so I vill be leaving 
you to face your end. Auf Weinerstein.&#39; The image faded afterward.

It took only a few seconds for Radinov to digest what transpired. She 
slammed the ground with her remaining fist angrily, snarling, &quot;Those 
bastards... those damned Nazi bastards! I was nothing but a guinea pig 
for their experiments! They had no intent of seeing me alive obviously.&quot; 
Then a small, bloody tear rolled down Radinov&#39;s cheek, &quot;And poor 
Hueng... I now seriously doubt they would&#39;ve given him the chip anyway, 
curse their racist souls.&quot;

She might have wallowed in self-pity from all this - but for some 
strange reason, an odd peace came over her. &quot;So I&#39;m to die again,&quot; 
Radinov said to herself. &quot;Fine... but not before I throw a little monkey 
wrench into their plans!&quot; Then she heard what appeared to the peals of 
almost-insane laughter behind her. &quot;She&#39;s on time. Good.&quot;

From the vegetation behind Radinov, the shadow form of Rally flowed and 
reformed itself into the nightmarish version of the vampire. &quot;OKAY, 
RADINOV,&quot; Rally crowed, a maniacal look in her glowing orange-red eyes, 
&quot;I HOPE YOUR PRAYING RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE I&#39;M READY FOR ROUND TWO - AND 
THIS TIME I&#39;M SENDING YOU STRAIGHT TO HELL!!&quot;

Radinov paused for a few second, not turning around as she said, &quot;Then I 
will save you the trouble... you&#39;ve won, Rally Vincent.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Rally was caught off-guard. This was not the reply she had hoped 
for. &quot;Okay, is this some sort of trick, Radinov? If it is, then I&#39;m not 
buying it!&quot;

&quot;There is no deception to it at all,&quot; Radinov said, standing up. For 
some reason, Rally could see that the expression on her face had 
changed. The cockiness and self-assured confidence she had seen on the 
assassin&#39;s face before was gone. It was replaced by a look of calm 
resignation - and if Rally wasn&#39;t mistaken, a little sadness as well. 
&quot;You have won, clearly and fairly. I... was wrong about you - and of me. 
Clearly, I am no match for the might of a TRUE vampire like you.&quot;

&quot;Radinov... what&#39;s wrong? Why are you giving up?&quot; Rally asked, clearly 
mystified.

Radinov just shook her head sadly. &quot;I am sorry that I couldn&#39;t provide 
you with the satisfaction of the kill, Rally Vincent, but there are 
other forces at work here - forces that will destroy this world if not 
stopped.&quot; Then quite suddenly, Radinov&#39;s body erupted in blue flame.

&#39;Oh crap!! Not again!?&#39; Rally thought to herself, seeing a familiar 
scene unfolding before her eyes.

&quot;RALLY, LISTEN TO ME,&quot; Radinov called out through the flames, 
&quot;MILLENNIUM IS COMING!! YOU HAVE TO TELL THE HELLSING ORGANIZATATION 
ABOUT THEM!! BE MY VENGEANCE, RALLY VINCENT.... STOP... MILLENNIUM...&quot; 
Radinov&#39;s body then broke-down into a pile of ash, the last remainder 
being an outstretched hand, as if reaching out for help.

&quot;Millennium? What the hell was that about?&quot; Rally gasped, still in shock 
from the scene.

&quot;Oh boy, talk about fucking overdrive!&quot; Rally turned around, an angry 
look on his face, only to see a smiling Revy standing behind her, with 
Seras bringing up the rear. &quot;I&#39;m telling you, I may be hard-core... but 
YOU are hard-core TO THE EXTREME!! Man, I&#39;m fucking glad we&#39;re not 
fighting anymore, &#39;cause I would be so fucking dead if we were!&quot;

Rally just smiled, her body quickly reverting to her more human 
appearance. &quot;Thanks for the compliment, but I&#39;m not THAT powerful,&quot; she 
said modestly. &quot;Quite frankly, compared to Alucard, I&#39;m fucking weak!&quot;

Revy just laughed. &quot;Well, you could&#39;ve fucking fooled me! Well enough 
about that, let&#39;s just head home.&quot;

Rally nodded - only to remember something. &quot;Oh my god, the chip!&quot; she 
gasped. &quot;It must&#39;ve burned-up with Radinov!&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about that, Rally,&quot; Seras said, holding up the chip 
that was dropped previously by Radinov. &quot;Revy found it and gave it to 
me. But that&#39;s not important right now; we&#39;ve got trouble behind us!&quot;

&quot;You mean the guy stalking us, Master?&quot; Rally said with a slight smile, 
starting to walk away with the others. &quot;Oh don&#39;t worry, I know about 
him. Caught sight of him coming here, and if I&#39;m not mistaken, he&#39;s 
going to make his appearance right about...&quot;

THUNK!!

&quot;...Now!&quot; All three girls then saw an object sticking into a tree three 
feet in front of them - one of the blessed bayonets used by Paladin 
Alexander Anderson!

&quot;What the fuck?&quot; Revy gasped, and then noticed the two vampires facing 
the general direction of the blade&#39;s origin. Stepping from the 
underbrush, Anderson, dressed in his usual gray cassock, walked calmly 
towards the three. Sensing trouble, she drew her gun towards the priest.

Anderson grinned mightily as two bayonets slipped from his sleeves. 
&quot;Really?&quot; he smirked loudly, &quot;Is th&#39;t th&#39; way a youn&#39; girl like ye is 
supposed t&#39; talk?&quot; He then paused, &quot;Actually, it would be a blessin&#39; t&#39; 
this world th&#39;t a damned unholy pirate like yerself were sent down t&#39; 
th&#39; pit by me blade!&quot;

&quot;Oh really, Father Motherfucker?&quot; Revy snarled, drawing a bead towards 
the priest&#39;s head. &quot;Well then take your best shot, because before you 
do, I&#39;m going to guarantee that...&quot; but then was startled when Rally 
gently placed her hand on the gun, lowering it.


&quot;The only guarantee is that all you&#39;ll ever do is waste expensive 
ammunition if you shoot him, Revy,&quot; Rally calmly said. &quot;He can 
regenerate any wound you might inflict, which means you&#39;ll be dead 
before you can make another attack.&quot; Returning her gaze to Anderson, she 
said, &quot;So, what brings Iscariot&#39;s top vampire killer to an island of 
killers? Certainly it&#39;s not for the sights.&quot;

Anderson just regarded Rally with contempt. &quot;Oh nothin&#39; much, just 
wanted t&#39; see how an abomination like ye is fairin&#39;. An&#39; from what Ah&#39;ve 
seen, ye&#39;ve become more of a danger than what should be allowed on God&#39;s 
good earth!&quot;

&quot;Why thank you,&quot; Rally sarcastically answered. &quot;And since you&#39;ve seen 
how I&#39;ve progressed, then that means that you know I can rip your head 
off and shove it up your ass in about five seconds flat, maybe before 
you can heal up... if you can regrow a head!&quot; Her eyes then glowed 
dangerously, &quot;Now if you&#39;re here for a fight, then I suggest we get this 
over with, because I&#39;m a little pissed from not being able to finish 
Radinov back there!&quot;

Several tense seconds had passed between the two. Then Anderson grinned 
again. &quot;Well, Ah guess th&#39;t this is yer lucky night, Rally Vincent. Ah 
was only sent here t&#39; study ye, not t&#39; fight ye. So if ye all be 
excusin&#39; me, Ah&#39;ve got me a plane back t&#39; Rome to catch.&quot; He then walked 
away, thinking to himself, &#39;An&#39; besides, there&#39;s still me battle with 
Alucard t&#39; consider. Ah&#39;m still not ready t&#39; face her just yet.&#39;

Seras let out a heavy sigh of relief. &quot;Oh thank goodness, it was very 
tense! I thought we were finished for sure!&quot;

Rally just watched the departing priest. &quot;I don&#39;t think a fight was what 
he wanted, Master,&quot; she said. &quot;If it was, then he would not have thrown 
that knife in front of us instead at one of us. But that just means 
things are going to get even more complicated regarding Iscariot.&quot; 
Cinching up her shoulders, she sighed and added, &quot;Now let&#39;s get back to 
the hotel. It&#39;s almost dawn, and I want to check-up on Moria.&quot;

THE HOTEL PENTHOUSE, AT THE SAME TIME...

Moria was still lying in bed when she woke up. She felt extremely tired, 
as if the lethargic manner of her movements were of any indication. &quot;You 
are awake, Miss Hedgley. Good.&quot; Looking at the source of the voice, she 
happened to see Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing sitting at her 
bedside, her suit looking a little slept-in. &quot;Actually, you had woken-up 
sooner than expected. The sun has yet to rise, you know.&quot;

&quot;W-what?&quot; Moria muttered, trying to sit-up, only to fall back down due 
to her dizziness.

Sir Integra smiled. &quot;You are still alive - and still human. Rally had 
only taken enough blood from you so that she could recover, although you 
did lose about a quarter of your blood volume.&quot;

&quot;I... see,&quot; the maid said, still a little confused.

Sir Integra just looked at the girl for a bit. &quot;You do realize that, by 
allowing Rally to take your blood, that you have become bonded to her - 
permanently. It is a bond that only a true death could break.&quot;

Moria nodded. &quot;I guess. Sir Integra - I&#39;ve got a confession I would like 
to make,&quot; she said.

&quot;Oh? And what is it, then?&quot; the Hellsing leader implored.

&quot;It&#39;s... concerning Rally and Seras. I suppose you already know of my - 
sexual preference?&quot; the maid said, looking somewhat embarrassed.

&quot;That you are a lesbian? I am not surprised, since I am one, too,&quot; Sir 
Integra replied, smiling.

&quot;You? I would have not noticed?&quot; Moria replied, obviously surprised.

&quot;I keep it to myself. You should not feel ashamed about being a lesbian. 
Even your grandfather knew about my homosexuality, and I suspect that my 
father might have known, but did not say anything about it.&quot; Sir Integra 
then settled in, adding, &quot;If you are wondering if it is alright to... 
well... having a relationship between Rally and Seras, I will not stop 
you. Even though I do love Seras myself, I had allowed her to have one 
with Rally, and I would not feel at all jealous if you had one with her 
as well.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t understand what you mean, Sir Integra?&quot; Moria asked, 
bewildered.

&quot;By habit, vampires are not monogamous creatures. If my family&#39;s history 
is to be believed, Alucard once had three Draculinas at his 
beck-and-call when my ancestor, Abraham Van Helsing, faced-off with him. 
It is something that is in their natures, please do not ask me why, 
mostly because I still do not understand it,&quot; Sir Integra explained.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad to hear that... but there&#39;s something else I wanted to 
share with you.&quot; Moria took a breath before continuing. &quot;That I wish to 
be a lover to Rally and Seras is true... but I also want to share my 
blood with them as well. My fear is that, what would happen to me if I 
was bitten by them - and I turn into a ghoul as a result... or worse?&quot;

&quot;I would not worry, Miss Hedgley,&quot; Sir Integra reassured. &quot;Remember, it 
was my father that had educated me about the particularities of 
vampires. And over history, it was discovered that, the only instance 
which anyone like you would be in danger of becoming a ghoul from a 
vampire&#39;s bite is that if a man were to place his seed within a woman&#39;s 
womb - and he would place himself in danger were he to place his seed 
within a man or a woman.&quot;

Moria listened in, curious. &quot;Incredible. But is this true?&quot;

&quot;Seras was very frank with me about her past sexual history. She had 
several female lovers long before she was turned by Alucard during the 
incident at Cheddar,&quot; Sir Integra explained. &quot;Also during this time, she 
had penetrated herself with several objects during masturbation, which 
included vibrators, artificial phalluses - even found a use of cucumbers 
that...&quot; she blushed at the thought, &quot;was not exactly culinary in 
nature.&quot;

&quot;Something that I done during my youth, except for the other lovers,&quot; 
the maid mused aloud - then remembered she had an audience. &quot;Oops! I... 
guess I shouldn&#39;t have said that!&quot;

Sir Integra chuckled, saying, &quot;Do not feel embarrassed about it, Miss 
Hedgley. I will also say that, if in the future you desire to become 
Rally&#39;s fledgling, although I may not approve of it... I will not stand 
in your way if you do... provided you conduct yourself properly. Now I 
suggest you get yourself some more rest. I am sure that you will have a 
lot to tell Rally once she returns. As for myself, I would best get 
myself cleaned-up before Seras and Rally return.&quot;

&quot;I will do that,&quot; Moria said, settling herself down. &quot;And Sir Integra?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Thank you for your candor on this matter,&quot; the maid said. As soon as 
Sir Integra left, though, Moria couldn&#39;t help but to touch the two 
puncture wounds on her neck. &#39;So me and Rally are now joined,&#39; she 
thought to herself. &#39;I&#39;ll need to ask her what it entails when we have 
our talk.&#39;

It was another hour before the three managed to return to the hotel. 
Rally happened to look at the gradually-brightening sky before stepping 
into the lobby. &quot;Boy, I&#39;m have to get some serious rest after my talk 
with Moria,&quot; she said. &quot;Between the experience with the holy water, the 
fight and Anderson, I&#39;m bushed.&quot;

&quot;Could&#39;ve fooled me,&quot; Revy remarked as she, Seras and Rally boarded the 
elevator. &quot;Still, I&#39;ve got to explain to Dutch about where I&#39;ve been all 
this time.&quot;

&quot;Not to mention myself having to explain to Sir Integra why I took off 
after Radinov myself,&quot; Seras added with a tone of worry on her face.

The ride up to the penthouse was rather uneventful... until the door 
opened-up, which the three saw Sir Integra standing in front of the 
penthouse&#39;s entrance, a stern look on her face. &quot;Well, Miss Victoria,&quot; 
she said, glaring at the Draculina, &quot;I am waiting for an explanation! 
Why have you left without authorization from me?&quot;

Seras cringed, almost withering under the Hellsing leader&#39;s gaze. Then 
she felt Rally&#39;s hand on her shoulder. Turning around, she found her 
servant smiling at her. &#39;Just be strong, Master,&#39; the dusky vampire said 
telepathically. &#39;Remember, I&#39;m right behind you.&#39;

Encouraged, Seras squared-up her shoulders, walked arrow-straight in 
front of in front of the woman she loved and said, &quot;Sir Integra, I 
accept full responsibility for my actions. I had let my emotions get the 
best of me and acted without your permission, possibly endangering the 
mission.&quot;

&quot;I appreciate your candor and your honest acceptance of your actions 
tonight, Miss Victoria,&quot; Sir Integra said. &quot;However, there is one thing 
you have omitted in your statement.&quot;

&quot;And... that is?&quot; Seras asked, confused... only to see Sir Integra&#39;s 
facial expression falter, to that of a person almost to the point of 
tears.

&quot;You had allowed your supreme commander to worry unnecessarily about 
your condition.&quot; Sir Integra then lunged forward and hugged Seras 
hugely. &quot;Seras... I was so frightened about you! I thought that awful 
Radinov would destroy you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Integra!&quot; Seras added, hugging her in turn. &quot;It was that... 
that after seeing Rally in the state she was in... I wasn&#39;t thinking 
straight!&quot; Tearing herself away, she once again straightened herself up 
and reached into her ammo belt. &quot;Anyway, the mission has been a 
success.&quot; She handed Sir Integra the FREAK chip and added, &quot;The 
representative of the Lagoon Company had recovered the FREAK chip and 
handed it to me without any incident.&quot;

&quot;So I see,&quot; Sir Integra said, examining the chip. &quot;Very well, have 
yourself cleaned up, Miss Victoria. I will express my thanks to Her 
Majesty on your work!&quot;

&quot;Yes sir!&quot; Seras replied, saluting. She then walked inside the 
penthouse.

&quot;Fuck,&quot; Revy grumbled. &quot;Why do they had to go through all that 
bullshit?&quot;

&quot;There is always protocol to perform in whatever we do, Miss Xiang,&quot; Sir 
Integra explained, overhearing. &quot;We are a royally-ordained agency. It is 
expected that we do our duties to the Queen and report to her whenever 
it is expected.&quot;

&quot;To you it&#39;s expected,&quot; Revy snorted, &quot;but to me, it&#39;s just another 
layer of bureaucracy to put-up with. In my opinion, just get the job 
done and don&#39;t worry about...&quot; she was about to add something that was 
offensive to Sir Integra - but after getting a rather-hostile look from 
Rally, thought better of it. &quot;If you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;ve gotta tell Dutch 
where the hell I was.&quot; She pushed aside the two and entered the 
penthouse.

&quot;Not very polite, that is for certain,&quot; the Hellsing leader observed. 
&quot;Rally, I suggest that you talk to Miss Hedgley. She woke-up just prior 
to your return.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;ll do just that,&quot; Rally said. &quot;However, there&#39;s something I 
need to tell you about?&quot;

Sir Integra&#39;s eyebrows raised. &quot;What is it that you need to tell my?&quot; 
she asked.

&quot;It happened before Radinov got burned-up by... whoever invented the 
chip.&quot; Rally sighed before continuing, &quot;There was something she told me 
that I don&#39;t understand... she said that, &#39;Millennium was coming&#39;. That 
may be our enemy.&quot;

&quot;Millennium?&quot; Sir Integra repeated, mystified. &quot;I wonder what she meant 
by that?&quot; She thought for a while. &quot;As soon as we return to London, I 
will have Walter look into that clue. We&#39;ll make certain this... 
Millennium will pay for what they are doing!&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s more,&quot; Rally added. &quot;I wasn&#39;t going to tell you this until I 
found more evidence to back it up but when I told Alucard about it, he 
then suggested I tell you anyway, provided you keep it a secret.&quot;

&quot;Tell me what?&quot; Sir Integra asked.

&quot;It happened the night Master freed me,&quot; Rally began after a few 
seconds. &quot;I was so enraptured about my new abilities; I allowed my mind 
to explore the grounds of the mansion. It was then I caught a brief 
mental flash of someone plotting against the Hellsing Organization.&quot;

Sir Integra caught her breath. &quot;A traitor... within Hellsing? Who?&quot;

&quot;I only caught a brief glimpse of the thought, then whoever was thinking 
about it clammed-up,&quot; explained Rally. &quot;Since then, I&#39;ve been exploring 
the mansion grounds, trying to find out. I&#39;m sorry Integra, but so far 
I&#39;ve only come up empty.&quot;

&quot;But at least now we have been forewarned about the traitor,&quot; Sir 
Integra said. &quot;Besides yourself and Alucard, who else has knowledge 
about this?&quot;

&quot;Just Master and Moria, who was present at the time. Now before you ask, 
no Moria is NOT the traitor,&quot; revealed Rally. &quot;I found that out when I 
took her blood.&quot;

Sir Integra took a few minutes to take-in this new information. &quot;Very 
well. I will keep your information about the traitor under confidence, 
even from Walter. What we do not need is the Hellsing Organization 
membership looking over their shoulders because of this... spy within 
our ranks.&quot;

&quot;Alucard thought you&#39;d say that,&quot; Rally agreed. &quot;Okay, now that I&#39;ve 
gotten that over with, I think I&#39;ll have that talk with Moria, and then 
head off to bed. Between the fight and Paladin Anderson showing up, I&#39;m 
about to fall down on my face.&quot;

&quot;Paladin Anderson was there too?&quot; Sir Integra looked surprised. &quot;And you 
and he did not fight?&quot;

&quot;He only said he was there to observe,&quot; Rally said. &quot;I guess he got a 
load of what I did with Radinov, he thought better. Now please, I like 
to talk to Moria and go to sleep.&quot;

&quot;That I agree with. Even though you had recovered, I do not wish you to 
harm yourself from an extended awake period,&quot; Sir Integra said as she 
went for the door. &quot;I will ask Seras to do the same, and then we can 
return to...&quot;

WHAM!!

Both women were surprised by the form of Pip Bernadotte landing at both 
their feet. &quot;OWWW!!&quot; the one-eyed Frenchman groaned, rubbing his jaw. 
&quot;Dutch, why ze hell deed you do zat?&quot;

Dutch rubbed his knuckles after he had decked the mercenary. &quot;That was 
for putting a gun to my head, that&#39;s what!&quot; However, he then hoisted Pip 
up and further said, &quot;However, I realize you were only following orders, 
so no harm done.&quot; Slapping Pip&#39;s shoulder, Dutch then added, &quot;Why don&#39;t 
you, for old time&#39;s sake, come down with the rest of us to the Yellow 
Flag and have a few drinks on me?&quot;

&quot;Well I love to,&quot; Pip began, &quot;but from what Mignonette told me, our 
mission here is a success, zo I better prepare for our return to 
London.&quot; Smiling, he added, &quot;Who knows, Dutch? Eef by any chance you 
find your way in England, I know of a pub we can have a few drinks 
zere... and maybe catch up on old times.&quot;

&quot;Hmmm... sounds interesting. I&#39;ll keep that in mind.&quot; Dutch then 
stretched and said, &quot;Well, just so long as we&#39;re not the ones you&#39;re 
after anymore, I think we should get out of your hair.&quot; He turned to the 
rest of the Lagoon Company, who were packing-up their things, and added, 
&quot;C&#39;mon guys, let&#39;s get ourselves back home.&quot;

&quot;And myself back to Hotel Moscow,&quot; Balalaika added. &quot;Sir Integra, you 
and your party are welcome to stay as long as you like here.&quot;

&quot;That is very kind, but since our purpose here is at an end, we shall be 
leaving the next evening,&quot; the Hellsing leader said. &quot;Please extend my 
thanks to Mr. Chang as well, Miss Balalaika.&quot;

&quot;Indeed I shall,&quot; the Russian said, departing.

&quot;Hey Revy?&quot; Rally added, seeing the Chinese girl one last time.

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

Rally smiled as she said, &quot;Try not to do anything that&#39;ll bring me back 
here to kick your ass.&quot;

&quot;I think I will,&quot; Revy answered. &quot;Later.&quot;

&quot;Uh, Miss Vincent?&quot; Rock added just as they were about to leave. &quot;Could 
you tell Moria I might be writing her soon. I just want to know how 
she&#39;s doing, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;ll do that,&quot; Rally said, heading for the bedroom.

Sir Integra then presented the former salaryman with a card. &quot;Here is 
the e-mail address to my home computer, Mr. Okajima. I will ask if Miss 
Hedgley has an e-mail account so that she can contact you as well.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Rock said, bowing, &quot;I will do that as soon as I feel you 
return.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully not TOO soon,&quot; Sir Integra added, bowing in turn.

Just outside the bedroom, Rally walked up to her father, who was talking 
to Seras. &quot;Master, I would like to have a little private time with 
Moria, if you don&#39;t mind?&quot;

&quot;Oh you don&#39;t need my permission to do that, Rally,&quot; the Draculina said. 
&quot;Just go ahead.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Rally then looked at her father. &quot;I&#39;m sorry that Revy had 
stolen some of your ammo, Dad. But still, she did help out against 
Radinov and...&quot; But then, she was surprised as Vincent held up his hand.

&quot;Revy didn&#39;t steal the bullets, Irene. I gave them to her,&quot; he said.

&quot;What? But why, Dad?&quot; asked Rally.

Vincent then placed his hands upon his daughter&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Mostly... 
because I nearly lost you that monster,&quot; he began. &quot;And then, when you 
went after her, even though you told her not to follow, I asked her to 
help you out.&quot; He then hugged Rally and added, &quot;Irene... I&#39;ve already 
lost you to the dark. I just didn&#39;t want to lose you altogether.&quot;

&quot;Gee Dad... thanks.&quot; Rally then pulled gently away and added, &quot;But you 
haven&#39;t lost me at all. Granted, I may be a vampire now... but I&#39;m still 
your little girl.&quot;

Vincent smiled. &quot;Nice to hear. Now I think you still have that talk with 
Moria to get over with, so I won&#39;t delay you any further.&quot;

Rally just nodded, then opened the door to the bedroom. As she closed 
the door behind her, Seras looked over to Vincent. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry too 
much,&quot; she said. &quot;She grown so much since that night. But I promise you, 
I&#39;ll try to keep an eye on her.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Vincent then left, adding, &quot;I better go with Pip to the 
mainland, and get ready to get you girls back to London.&quot; Seras didn&#39;t 
say anything, but she smiled and waved.

Silently, Rally walked over to the side of the bed, where Moria was 
sleeping. She then sat at the edge and gently roused the maid. &quot;Mmm... 
oh Rally, you&#39;re back,&quot; she said sleepily.

&quot;Sorry to get you up, Moria,&quot; the dusky vampire began. &quot;Anyway, I was 
wondering how you are feeling.&quot;

&quot;Better,&quot; the maid answered, &quot;although I&#39;m still a little weak, but I 
guess that should resolve itself in time.&quot; Blushing, Moira then added, 
&quot;Rally, there is... something I need to tell you about but I&#39;m not sure 
about how to approach it.&quot;

&quot;You mean about your dreams?&quot; Rally said, smiling. &quot;I must admit, they 
were pretty racy. I didn&#39;t know you had those feelings for me.&quot;

&quot;How... how did you know about my dreams?&quot; Moria gasped. &quot;I haven&#39;t told 
anyone about them!&quot;

&quot;Easy... YOU told me, through your blood.&quot; Rally then directly eyed 
Moria and added, &quot;When a vampire drinks the blood of a living human, 
that vampire learns everything about that person - their hopes, fears... 
and passions. Believe me, your passions were more than a surprise to 
me.&quot; However, she then added mentally, &#39;But there&#39;s something else I 
need to talk to you about.&#39;

&quot;What?&quot; Moria was surprised to hear Rally&#39;s telepathic message. &quot;Rally, 
how did you...&quot; but she stopped when the dusky vampire held up her hand.

&#39;No, don&#39;t talk,&#39; was Rally&#39;s mental reply. &#39;Use your thoughts, not your 
voice.&#39;

Now Moria was really confused. Speak... without words? &#39;What does she 
mean by that?&#39; she thought. &#39;I&#39;m a human, not a vampire! How can I 
possibly talk to her without TALKING?&#39;

&#39;I think you&#39;re doing aright, Moira,&#39; Rally said, smiling.

The maid&#39;s eyes went wide. &#39;Incredible! I AM communicating with you! How 
is this possible?&#39;

&#39;The reason is, Moria, is that we are now linked,&#39; Rally answered. &#39;When 
you gave me your blood, at the same time I took in your memories, the 
process also bound our minds together. I can communicate with you... and 
you with me.&#39;

&#39;That&#39;s unbelievable! But Rally, if we can communicate to each other, 
could I communicate with the other vampires in the same manner?&#39; Moria 
asked.

Rally shook her head, &#39;I&#39;m afraid not. Our rapport right now is 
exclusive. Only when you become a vampire is THAT possible... and that 
what I want to talk to you about. Moria, I&#39;m not certain if becoming a 
vampire is the best thing for you right now.&#39;

&#39;I&#39;m... not sure I follow,&#39; Moria replied.

&#39;Moria, I became a vampire only because of a rash impulse; I was injured 
badly, close to the point of death. But my friend May was captured by an 
enemy of mine - Goldie - and I didn&#39;t want to leave her in that bitch&#39;s 
hands. So I made the decision to become Master&#39;s fledgling.&#39; Rally 
sighed a bit before continuing. &#39;I was a little ill-prepared for what 
becoming a vampire would do for me. At one time, I even thought of 
committing suicide, squandering the second chance Master gave me.&#39;

&#39;But you DID adjust, didn&#39;t you, Rally?&#39; Moria implored mentally.

&#39;Yeah, but it was rough going,&#39; Rally added. &#39;There were a few things I 
had to adapt to, like controlling my bloodthirst. If I&#39;m not careful, I 
could possibly end-up killing some innocent person, which would&#39;ve 
forced Integra to get rid of me... and I don&#39;t want to do that to her, 
Moria! And I&#39;m even covering another disadvantage - having to see people 
like Integra, Walter and Dad grow old and die, while I&#39;m still looking 
young. I probably not going to be able to convince you not to follow me 
as a vampire... but I DO want you to do this for me.&#39;

&#39;And that is?&#39; asked Moria.

&#39;Think about what you&#39;re doing to yourself if you make that decision. 
Ask yourself, &#39;is this the best path for me? Will all the trouble of the 
prospect of becoming lonely for... possibly a thousand years or more be 
worth becoming a vampire?&#39; Promise me, Moria that you&#39;ll think about it 
- long and carefully before making your choice.&#39;

It took a few seconds before Moria realized that Rally only had her best 
intentions in mind with this revelation. &#39;If it will make you happy,&#39; 
she finally said, &#39;then I will give the matter all the thought it 
deserves. I still wish to be your fledgling - but I promise that I will 
think about it first.&#39;

Rally smiled, sensing the sincerity in her friend&#39;s thoughts. &quot;That&#39;s 
good,&quot; she said aloud. &quot;Then you can do me one more favor.&quot;

&quot;And what favor do you have?&quot; Moria asked, smiling slyly.

Rally then crawled in bed next to Moria, saying, &quot;You can make room for 
me. I&#39;m bushed.&quot;

&quot;Oh I think I can accommodate that,&quot; the maid said. &quot;After all, this bed 
is rather generous. I suspect that we can have at least four people here 
if we want.&quot;

&quot;Good... because there&#39;s something else I like to ask of you.&quot; Rally was 
silent for a bit, then laid close to Moria.

&quot;Why do I have the suspicion that someone else is joining us?&quot; queried 
Moira - only to be surprised to discover Seras lying behind her.

&quot;Well,&quot; the Draculina said, &quot;I did learn from Sir Integra that you are 
interested in me as well. And besides, I&#39;m rather tired, myself.&quot;

&quot;But this is so sudden!&quot; Moria gasped, finding herself in-between two 
cold-bodied vampires. &quot;And besides, I don&#39;t think I have the stamina to 
do anything!&quot;

&quot;Who said you need to do anything,&quot; Rally yawned, &quot;except... sleep...&quot;

&quot;B-but... oh bloody hell, they&#39;re both out of it,&quot; Moria moaned, finding 
both Rally and Seras deep asleep. &quot;Oh well, it&#39;s going to be a long 
flight back. Might as well make the best... yawn... of it.&quot;

Soon afterward, Moria drowsily found herself falling asleep. By all 
rights, she should be terrified to be in such close proximity to two 
potentially-dangerous vampires. However, she didn&#39;t care one way or the 
other. Carefully, she snuggled herself closer to Rally&#39;s face, and soon 
found herself falling deeply asleep.
