<a href="../crossover/echoduel-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Arisugawa Juri groaned softly, forcing herself up from
her seat as the intercom went off. She hadn&#39;t been
home long from visiting the Masaki shrine, and she had
been hoping to spend a quiet night alone. &#39;Obviously
not,&#39; she thought wryly.

&quot;It&#39;s Nabiki,&quot; the quietly familiar sounding voice
said once Juri activated the intercom, &quot;can I come
up?&quot;

&#39;What in the world?&#39; Juri thought. She knew only one
woman with that name, Tendo Nabiki of the Tendo dojo
of Anything Goes Martial Arts. She had trained there a
while back, then left for various reasons, but had
kept in loose touch with all of them. &quot;Sure, come on
up,&quot; Juri hit the switch to unlock the front door of
the apartment building.

A few moments later there was a knock on the door and
Juri answered, taking in the black haired woman who
stood there. Dressed in casual clothes Nabiki looked
stylish, but the red around her eyes and the duffel
bag she carried were both not good signs.

&quot;Sorry to barge in like this, Arisugawa,&quot; Nabiki said
as she gracefully took her shoes off by the door, &quot;I
was originally planning just to hit a hotel later
tonight, but I don&#39;t know which are reputable around
here.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Juri answered, wondering wryly if Nabiki
intended to crash here for the night. &quot;Are you taking
a few days vacation?&quot; she asked, waving her over to
the couch.

Nabiki&#39;s lips twitched slightly, not quite forming a
smile. &quot;Haven&#39;t you checked your messages yet?&quot; she
asked. &quot;I bet there&#39;s one from Akane, telling you I&#39;m
coming.&quot;

&quot;No, I haven&#39;t,&quot; Juri agreed, walking over to hit the
switch on the machine. She listened to a few responses
from her advertisement looking for help, a slightly
plaintive call from a one-night-stand asking why Juri
hadn&#39;t seem her again and finally the message from
Akane.

&quot;Arisugawa-san,&quot; Akane quietly said, &quot;there&#39;s been
some trouble at the dojo and Nabiki has left. From
things that were said I suspect she&#39;s on her way
there.&quot;

Juri turned off the machine, looking over to where
Nabiki tiredly slumped on the couch. &quot;You&#39;re welcome
to stay if you need to,&quot; she told her friend gently.

Nabiki rubbed at her face with her hands, then looked
at Juri wryly. &quot;I may need to, if only to stretch out
my money,&quot; she sighed.

Juri went into the kitchen, getting a bottle down and
pouring two drinks before walking to the couch.
&quot;Here,&quot; she passed one to Nabiki before sitting down
by her on the couch.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Nabiki took it and slugged back half,
wincing slightly at the taste. &quot;Strong,&quot; she managed
then added, &quot;good.&quot;

Juri had some of her drink, sipping a bit more
cautiously. &quot;Would I regret asking what happened?&quot; she
asked Nabiki.

&quot;You can probably guess,&quot; Nabiki grimaced as she took
another drink. A sigh,. &quot;Soun and I had that little
talk I&#39;ve been meaning to have with him the last few
years and it didn&#39;t go too well.&quot;

Juri blinked, then got it. &quot;You came out to him,&quot; she
didn&#39;t even make it a question.

&quot;Bingo,&quot; Nabiki nodded.

&quot;So why is there a problem?&quot; Juri asked, feeling an
unexpected flash of anger. &quot;Soun hasn&#39;t got a problem
with Ranma and Akane sharing a room,&quot; she asked
disbelievingly, &quot;so why would he care what you do?&quot;

Nabiki stared straight ahead, and Juri realized the
young woman was fighting to keep her self control.
&quot;That was pretty much Akane&#39;s argument,&quot; she agreed,
&quot;but Soun&#39;s opinion is that Ranma is a man, under a
curse, and therefore the two of them aren&#39;t perverts.&quot;

Juri restrained her temper, &quot;He didn&#39;t call you that.&quot;

&quot;Oh yes he did,&quot; Nabiki bit out.

Juri reached out to put her hand on Nabiki&#39;s arm,
seeing the first glistening tears appearing at the
corners of her eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said awkwardly.

&quot;Not your fault,&quot; Nabiki wiped a tear away
impatiently, but more were coming. &quot;Why do parents
have to be such...?&quot; she trailed off.

Acting on instinct Juri tugged Nabiki over, letting
her head rest on Juri&#39;s shoulder as she finally burst
into tears. Juri murmured comforting things to the
girl as Nabiki sobbed out the day&#39;s stress and pain,
letting out her sudden grief.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Nabiki finally pulled back and Juri let
her go, smiling up at Arisugawa weakly.

&quot;No problem,&quot; Juri answered, picking up Nabiki&#39;s drink
and passing it back to the young woman. &quot;Do you have
someplace to stay tonight?&quot;

&quot;I was planning on hitting a hotel,&quot; Nabiki conceded.

&quot;Stay here, then,&quot; Juri offered.

&quot;Ah,&quot; Nabiki hesitated, &quot;Arisugawa, I like you but not
in that way...&quot;

Juri looked at her blankly for a moment then began
laughing softly. &quot;The couch, Nabiki,&quot; she said
quietly, &quot;I&#39;m offering you the couch.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Nabiki blushed, looking mildly sheepish.

Juri finished her drink then got up, walking over to
the closet and returning with clean sheets and a
pillow. &quot;We&#39;ll see if we can figure something out in
the morning,&quot; she said as she passed them over to
Nabiki. A idea was forming in the back of her head,
but she was going to have to wait before she actually
said anything aloud.

&quot;You&#39;re kinder than your rep, Arisugawa,&quot; Nabiki
sighed as she took them.

&quot;I&#39;m trying to turn over a new leaf,&quot; Juri answered as
she turned to go, &quot;have a good night.&quot;

The morning came far too early for Tendo Nabiki,
resting on the borrowed couch of what was at best an
acquaintance. &#39;I can&#39;t believe I said that,&#39; she
thought as she peered into the bathroom mirror,
tidying her black hair. Dressed in her nightie she
returned to the living room, the smell of cooking in
the air.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Juri nodded, standing in front of the
stove as she watched a boiling pot. She stirred the
noodles as she added, &quot;I made enough for two.&quot;

&quot;Instant noodles?&quot; Nabiki blinked.

&quot;I&#39;m a bad cook,&quot; Juri shrugged, &quot;my attempts at it
tend to result in serious illness, queasiness or
possibly even death.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so sure,&quot; Nabiki said, even though she did notice
that once Juri served it up the noodles they were just
a bit burnt.

Sitting down with her to eat Juri asked, &quot;So what are
your plans?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Nabiki admitted as she slurped up some
noodles. &quot;I&#39;ll start looking for a part time job
first,&quot; she mused, &quot;then find a place to stay.&quot;

&quot;You can stay here as long as you need,&quot; Juri found
herself smiling wickedly, &quot;as long as you&#39;re not
worried about being ravaged in your sleep.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s going to take awhile before I live that down,&quot;
Nabiki sighed.

&quot;Probably,&quot; Juri agreed. She had some of her noodles
before asking, &quot;What sort of job were you looking
for?&quot;

Nabiki looked at Juri thoughtfully, wondering where
the woman was going with the question. &quot;I suppose I&#39;d
take just about anything,&quot; she admitted.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Juri nodded then asked, &quot;you used to handle all
the Tendo family finances, right?&quot;

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Nabiki blinked.

Juri fiddled with her plate a moment, &quot;I&#39;m considering
starting a business and I could use someone to look
after the finances.&quot; She gave Nabiki a look, &quot;Not that
I wouldn&#39;t keep a close eye on you, considering some
of the money making schemes you&#39;ve pulled over the
years.&quot;

For the first time since she had entered the apartment
Nabiki&#39;s eyes lit up in interest. &quot;What kind of
business?&quot; she asked.

Juri fought back the urge to smile. &quot;I&#39;m working on
opening a bar for women,&quot; she revealed, &quot;called
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.&quot;</pre>
