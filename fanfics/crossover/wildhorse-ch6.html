<h1>The Wild Horse Thesis (part 6 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/calamity.html">Calamity-Queen of Cordite</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/wildhorse-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Kasumi sighed as she prepared the tea service. The last episode of Neon 
Genesis Evangelion 1/2 had caused quite a stir. Those people could sit 
out there and watch as all sorts of ugly things happened to Ranma 
without expressing a word of distress, but the minute it looked like 
Ranma might have a chance at happiness they all condemned him, including 
her little sister.

Kasumi fully understood the sentiments Ranma had expressed about not 
wanting to come back. She wouldn&#39;t either if she had a chance to escape 
from such selfish people. Kasumi fervently hoped that Ranma would find 
happiness with that Rei girl, at least for a little while, otherwise he 
might never be able to be happy with any woman.

Pasting her pleasant smile back on her face, Kasumi picked up the tea 
service and headed back out to the table.

After everyone got their refreshments, Nabiki started the tape again.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma and Rei were seated at the table eating breakfast. Rei&#39;s training 
had begun and while she was a rank beginner, Ranma was impressed with 
her speed and strength. Not only that, she had a focus and a learning 
curve that matched his own. After he had shown her a kata and corrected 
her movements, she performed them perfectly every time with her 
trademark mechanical precision.

Misato&#39;s door opened and the living dead shambled out. The zombie, whose 
hair was standing up on one side in a giant cowlick, scratched the 
underside of her left breast as she plopped bonelessly down at her place 
at the table. Cracking open the beer in front of her, she upended it, 
slamming the entire contents in one long pull. It always amazed Ranma to 
watch the process. He could practically see her energy level rising as 
the beer level dropped.

&quot;YEEEEHAWWW!&quot; Misato belted out, slamming the empty can down on the 
table. &quot;That&#39;s the stuff!&quot;

The zombie returned to life; her morning resurrection ritual completed. 
Misato then began to eat her breakfast as Rei gave her an odd look and 
Ranma chuckled.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Ranma grinned at Rei. &quot;Ya get used to it after a 
while.&quot;

Rei nodded and returned to her breakfast, finishing up the last of it as 
the doorbell rang. Misato looked up and started to lever herself up.

&quot;Um, Misato, I know I ain&#39;t got no feminine modesty, but are you sure 
you wanna answer the door like that?&quot; Ranma laughed.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; Misato teased. &quot;You wanna keep Rei and me all for 
yourself?&quot;

Ranma blushed and laughed nervously before smirking.

&quot;Ya got me, Mi-chan,&quot; Ranma said with his lady-killer smile. &quot;I&#39;m 
startin&#39; a harem and you and Rei are the first members.&quot; Ranma rolled 
his eyes. &quot;Give me a break. I&#39;ll get the door.&quot;

The door opened to reveal Toji and Kensuke, otherwise known as the 
slavering perverts.

&quot;Hiya guys,&quot; Ranma greeted. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;

&quot;Morning, Ranma,&quot; Toji said. &quot;We just came by to walk with ya to 
school.&quot;

&quot;Oh, really?&quot; Ranma smirked. &quot;I rate an escort now? And you didn&#39;t just 
come by to see Misato?&quot;

&quot;Misato&#39;s here?&quot; Kensuke asked as if surprised.

&quot;Helloooo, Misato!&quot; the two perverts said leaning in the door.

&quot;Hi Boooys,&quot; Misato sang back from the dining room.

&quot;You&#39;re so lucky, Ranma,&quot; Toji gushed.

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Ranma smirked then looked back toward the dining room. 
&quot;Rei, you ready to go?&quot;

Rei appeared from the dining room with their school bags and walked up 
beside Ranma handing him his. Toji and Kensuke blinked.

&quot;I am ready,&quot; she said softly.

&quot;Alright, let&#39;s get going then,&quot; Ranma said cheerfully.

&quot;Hey Ranma, what was Rei doing at your place?&quot; Toji asked as they walked 
down the sidewalk.

&quot;Oh, she lives there now,&quot; Ranma mentioned casually.

&quot;You&#39;re living with TWO women now?&quot; Kensuke asked.

&quot;Geez, you make it sound like we&#39;re all sleepin&#39; in the same bed,&quot; Ranma 
snorted. &quot;We all have separate bedrooms and ain&#39;t nothin&#39; goin&#39; on. Rei 
moved in because I&#39;m trainin&#39; her in the art and this way we get in some 
training in the morning before school.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re training in the martial arts, Rei?&quot; Toji asked the impassive 
girl in surprise.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Rei stated. &quot;Ranma has proven that his training in the martial 
arts has made him a more efficient pilot. I, too, wish to become a more 
efficient pilot.&quot;

Kensuke jumped in front of Ranma on his knees, his hands together under 
his chin in supplication as tears poured out of his eyes.

&quot;Ranma, please train me too. I wanna be an Eva pilot too!&quot; the 
bespectacled boy pleaded, causing Ranma to roll his eyes.

&quot;I kinda want to focus on Rei right now,&quot; Ranma declined. &quot;I&#39;ve never 
trained anyone before so I don&#39;t wanna get in over my head.&quot;

After all, he did have to get Rei up to speed for when Asuka arrived. 
That way they could act as sparring partners.

&quot;Man, Ranma, you just don&#39;t know how good you&#39;ve got it,&quot; Toji sighed. 
&quot;I mean, Misato&#39;s like a total babe. I&#39;d give anything to live with her 
and get to see her every day. And now you&#39;re living with Ayanami too.&quot;

&quot;Geez, wipe the drool off your chin, Toji,&quot; Ranma said in exasperation. 
&quot;Sorry, Rei, they&#39;re good guys but they can be a bit on the perverted 
side sometimes.&quot;

&quot;I am not offended,&quot; Rei said coolly.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma smirked as he heard the squeal of tires out in the parking lot. He 
knew exactly who that was and didn&#39;t bother to get up.

&quot;Hey, it&#39;s Misato and damn she looks good,&quot; Kensuke called out.

He and Toji were practically hanging out the window waving and calling 
out to her. Just about every boy in the class stampeded to the windows 
to look.

&quot;Slavering perverts,&quot; Ranma said, rolling his eyes before continuing his 
conversation with Rei.

&quot;Do you think Captain Katsuragi is unattractive?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;No, it&#39;s not that,&quot; Ranma denied. &quot;Misato is definitely attractive, a 
little ditzy sometimes, but attractive.&quot;

&quot;Why then do you not act like the other boys?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;Why would I want to act like a hormone-crazed idiot?&quot; Ranma asked. &quot;It 
just always struck me as stupid to act like that. Maybe it&#39;s because, as 
martial artist, I have to be in control of my body, or maybe because my 
&#39;condition&#39; has taken all the mystery out of the female body for me. I 
guess it just takes more than a nice body and a pretty face to turn my 
head.&quot;

&#39;Or maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve been conditioned that if I even look at a 
girl sideways, I end up with another fianc&eacute;e or a blunt object to the 
head; sometimes both,&#39; Ranma added mentally.

&quot;What qualities do you find attractive in a female,&quot; Rei inquired.

&quot;I dunno,&quot; Ranma said pensively. &quot;I guess the girl I&#39;m attracted to 
would be someone who listens to me and doesn&#39;t jump to any conclusions. 
She&#39;d ask my opinion instead assumin&#39; she knows what I think. She 
wouldn&#39;t be all possessive like she owns me or somethin&#39;. She wouldn&#39;t 
be all violent every time my opinion isn&#39;t the same as hers. I guess 
that&#39;s about it.&quot;

Meanwhile, Rei was measuring herself against his standards. A small 
smile curved her lips as she discovered that she scored quite well in 
the assessment.

Ranma had no clue why Rei was smiling, but it was something he liked to 
see on the unnaturally dispassionate girl, so he returned her smile. 
Several girls in the class that had been covertly watching wanted to cry 
out to the gods about the injustice of it all. In their estimation, 
Ranma was a total hunk and they couldn&#39;t understand how he could 
possibly ignore their various attempts to capture his attention and yet 
a girl that had less emotional depth than the average rock managed to 
catch his interest.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Wow, it looks great,&quot; Ranma enthused. &quot;I never was too fond of that 
purple color. Reminds me of someone I&#39;d just as soon forget about.&quot;

Ranma, Dr. Akagi, and Rei were currently looking over the repaired and 
repainted Unit 01. It was now a dark blue color with the same green and 
black trim as it had before.

&quot;I thought you might like it,&quot; Dr. Akagi smiled. &quot;I remember you 
mentioning that you didn&#39;t like the purple so since we had to repaint 
the whole thing anyway, I had them change it.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Doc,&quot; Ranma smiled broadly. &quot;That was real nice of you.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t a problem,&quot; the blonde said giving the pigtailed pilot a warm 
smile. &quot;Besides, maybe now you&#39;ll try harder to keep the paint from 
being burnt off it.&quot;

Ranma chuckled and scratched the base of his pigtail.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; he said.

&quot;Well, now that you&#39;ve seen your Eva&#39;s new look, I believe we have a 
Sync Test for you and Rei to get to,&quot; Dr. Akagi laughed. &quot;After that, I 
thought we could do some testing with the naginata.&quot;

&quot;Okay, sure,&quot; Ranma agreed.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Captain Katsuragi reporting as ordered, Sir,&quot; Misato announced as she 
stood before Gendo&#39;s desk.

&quot;Rei Ayanami has moved in with you and the Third Child. Why?&quot; Gendo 
questioned succinctly.

&quot;Sir, I overheard them discussing Rei moving closer so that they could 
meet in the mornings to train,&quot; Misato answered. &quot;Rei has asked Ranma to 
teach her his martial arts to make her a better Eva pilot. Since you 
ordered that the Third Child be stressed as little as possible, I 
offered to let Rei move into the remaining bedroom at my place so that 
they could maximize their time together.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Gendo said. &quot;And what is the relationship between Rei and the 
Third Child?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure what you mean, Sir,&quot; Misato said. &quot;As far as I know, Ranma 
seems pretty oblivious to female interest, which there&#39;s a lot of. As 
for Rei, I couldn&#39;t say. She&#39;s pretty unreadable, but she does seem to 
be interested in what Ranma can teach her.&quot;

&quot;Very well, I will allow it for now,&quot; Gendo said, thinking that if the 
boy is concentrating on training Rei, he&#39;ll have less time to see to 
Gendo&#39;s &#39;exercise&#39;.

After Misato left the office, Fuyutsuki appeared out of the shadows.

&quot;Do you think the Third Child is trying to form some sort of romantic 
relationship with Ayanami?&quot; the older man asked.

&quot;If he is, he will find out soon enough that Rei is incapable of forming 
such a bond,&quot; Gendo said. &quot;From what the Captain says, the boy may not 
be capable of such a bond either. It won&#39;t be a problem as long as it 
doesn&#39;t affect their ability to pilot.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Rei and Ranma had just entered the apartment from their morning workout 
on the roof of the building when Misato&#39;s door slid open and Misato 
walked out. Ranma was expecting it but it hadn&#39;t prepared him for the 
reality. Misato was wearing her conservative NERV dress uniform, looking 
every inch the consummate professional from the hem of her long skirt to 
the fact that she had her game face on.

&quot;Whoa, looking good, Misato,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;You clean up pretty good.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to be in Old Tokyo at a meeting all day,&quot; Misato said in a 
tone that was all business. &quot;I won&#39;t be home until late so don&#39;t bother 
making dinner for me. I&#39;ll probably have something there.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Kay, well, good luck and call me if you need me,&quot; Ranma smirked.

Misato nodded and left.

&quot;Rei, you go ahead and get a bath while I make breakfast,&quot; Ranma said. 
&quot;After I bathe we&#39;ll head in to NERV. I don&#39;t know why they want us 
hanging out there today. It&#39;s almost like they expect something.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Misato and Ritsuko entered the large convention hall and quickly located 
the table with the sign reading NERV on it. The pair looked rather 
isolated being seated at such a large table with only the two of them. 
Misato figured it was something of a snub that Gendo had only sent 
herself and Ritsuko to an event that the hosts obviously felt was of 
great importance.

Indeed, it was of great importance to NERV because if things went well 
today for the Jet Alone project and their backers, it would 
detrimentally cut into NERV&#39;s UN funding.

The presentation began with the company mouthpiece scientist giving the 
gathered audience an overview of the benefits and capabilities of the 
Jet Alone mecha. When he got to the part detailing the power source, an 
onboard nuclear reactor, Ritsuko raised a question.

&quot;Do you really think it&#39;s safe to have a nuclear reactor onboard this 
machine?&quot; Ritsuko asked in a slightly condescending tone.

&quot;Ah, our esteemed guests from NERV,&quot; the scientist said in a matching 
tone. &quot;I can assure you it&#39;s entirely safe and a lot less cumbersome 
than having to drag a power cord around.&quot;

The two then proceeded to get into a technical discussion where in they 
both took shots at each other pointing out the deficiencies in both 
approaches. Finally, Ritsuko played her trump card.

&quot;The fact remains that NERV is the only one capable of countering the 
threat the angels pose,&quot; she said smugly.

&quot;Ah, you must be referring to your &#39;AT&#39; field,&quot; the man smirked 
knowingly at the stunned NERV attendees. &quot;Rest assured, you may have the 
advantage now, but that won&#39;t last forever.&quot;

Of course, Ritsuko knew there was no way they could duplicate the AT 
field because it was a product of what the Eva&#39;s really were, not an 
effect produced by a piece of machinery. Misato, on the other hand, was 
furious because it seemed someone was leaking NERV secrets.

(oO\O/Oo)

After a break for lunch, everyone had gathered in the control bunker to 
observe the first public demonstration of the Jet Alone mecha. Much pomp 
and fanfare accompanied the large hanger splitting down the middle as 
the halves rolled away to reveal a large humanoid mecha. It had a 
hunchbacked appearance, its red faceplate set low between the shoulders. 
The shoulders were painted red while the arms, angular torso and upper 
legs were a dull metallic gray. The lower legs were colored dark blue.

The spokesman began giving a play-by-play as the team of scientists and 
techs began the startup procedure. Slowly, four rods extended from the 
mecha&#39;s back and shoulders. The spokesman explained that they had pulled 
the control rods from the fission pile and the reactor was now powering 
up.

As the giant mecha took a step the spokesman gushed like he had just 
seen his child take its first step. Misato was less than impressed where 
she leaned against the wall aloofly.

&quot;Yeah, yeah, so it took a step. Big deal,&quot; she sneered. &quot;But can it 
fight is the question.&quot;

Suddenly there was some consternation among the techs and scientists 
controlling Jet Alone. It seems that the mecha had continued walking 
after they gave it the command to stop. Nothing they tried seemed to 
work and people scattered as Jet Alone came crashing through the 
convention center.

&quot;Sir, we have another problem,&quot; one of the Jet Alone techs called out. 
&quot;We can&#39;t reinsert the control rods and the reactor&#39;s core temperature 
is rising. If we can&#39;t get those rods in soon the reactor will...oh no!&quot;

&quot;What is it? What&#39;s happening?&quot; the spokesman demanded.

&quot;If Jet Alone stays on its present course and speed, it will be in the 
middle of Atsugi City when the core melts down,&quot; the horrified tech 
said.

&quot;Oh no,&quot; the spokesman scientist lamented, his shoulders slumped in 
defeat. &quot;What are we going to do? This is terrible.&quot;

Misato finally had enough as the Jet Alone personnel all but gave up and 
began having a pity party. She whipped out her cell phone and called up 
NERV.

&quot;This is Captain Katsuragi,&quot; she said into the phone. &quot;We&#39;ve got a 
problem here. The Jet Alone robot has run out of control and is going to 
have a nuclear meltdown in Atsugi City if we don&#39;t stop it. I need Ranma 
and Unit 01 here ASAP, and have them bring a radiation suit.&quot;

Misato hung up the phone and took charge of the situation.

&quot;Okay, listen up,&quot; Misato barked out, getting the depressed Jet Alone 
people&#39;s attention. &quot;Look, Jet Alone is not accepting transmitted 
commands, right? Well, if I can get aboard, I can enter the commands to 
shut down the reactor directly. I just need the password for the 
system.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not authorized to give you the password,&quot; the lead 
scientist/spokesman said miserably.

&quot;Well I suggest you call someone who is, because unless I get the 
password a lot of people are going to die,&quot; Misato growled.

The man gulped, pulled out his cell phone, and began making calls.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;So why can&#39;t I just destroy it, Misato?&quot; Ranma asked her. &quot;It&#39;d be a 
lot easier than this stunt you&#39;re about to pull.&quot;

&quot;Because, Ranma, we want to avoid irradiating the countryside with a 
nuclear meltdown,&quot; Misato said in an overly patient tone as she pulled 
on the radiation suit.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Ranma said. He had always wondered why they didn&#39;t just blow the 
thing to pieces.

&quot;And we&#39;re the only ones that can not only get aboard Jet Alone and 
enter the commands directly to its onboard computer, but also stop Jet 
Alone&#39;s progress toward Atsugi City while we do it,&quot; Misato continued.

&quot;Oh, okay,&quot; Ranma shrugged. &quot;Well, no problem. It&#39;ll be a walk in the 
park.&quot;

&quot;Says the boy who will be nice and safe in his Eva behind an AT field,&quot; 
Misato groused.

&quot;Hey, you could&#39;ve had Rei come along to pilot Unit 01 and I could&#39;ve 
gotten in the thing to shut it down,&quot; Ranma pointed out. &quot;I am a lot 
stronger and physically capable than you.&quot;

Misato looked at him, her eye twitching at being called less physically 
capable than a 14-year-old boy, no matter whether it was true or not.

&quot;Yeah, well, you don&#39;t have the computer skills that I do and Rei was 
needed in case an angel attacks while we&#39;re busy,&quot; Misato shot back.

&quot;Yeah, well, I think you just wanna play the hero for a change,&quot; Ranma 
smirked, crossing his arms over his chest.

&quot;The thought never crossed my mind,&quot; Misato sniffed.

&quot;Riiight,&quot; Ranma drawled with a grin.

&quot;Um...Captain Katsuragi?&quot; a tentative voice called out as a defeated 
looking man walked up to them.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Misato said in a short, irritated tone.

&quot;Are you really going to do this?&quot; the man asked.

&quot;Somebody has to try to stop your little runaway project before it kills 
a lot of people,&quot; Misato replied.

The man sighed heavily.

&quot;I know,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;The password is &#39;Hope&#39;. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Misato just nodded and the man turned and walked away.

(oO\O/Oo)

Jet Alone came into view as the plane carrying Unit 01, Ranma, and 
Misato approached. It was striding along like it had a sense of 
determination.

&quot;We&#39;re approaching the drop point,&quot; the pilot said. &quot;Get ready.&quot;

&quot;You ready, Misato?&quot; Ranma asked, looking down at where the woman was 
clutched lightly in Unit 01&#39;s hand.

&quot;All set here,&quot; Misato said, giving Ranma a thumbs-up.

&quot;We&#39;ll be dropping in 3...2...1...Eva released,&quot; the pilot said as Unit 
01 slid back on the drop booms and was released to free fall to the 
ground.

Ranma tried to protect Misato as well as possible as the Eva hit the 
ground with a bone-jarring impact. The massive mecha skidded a short 
ways before Ranma broke into a run, headed for Jet Alone as fast as 
possible.

&quot;You okay, Misato?&quot; Ranma asked as he ran.

&quot;I&#39;m fine, Ranma,&quot; Misato reported. &quot;Gonna feel it in the morning, but 
I&#39;m fine for now.&quot;

&quot;Going soft on me, Misato?&quot; Ranma chuckled. &quot;This hero stuff hurts, 
don&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Whatever, Ranma,&quot; Misato shot back. &quot;Just get me to Jet Alone and I&#39;ll 
take care of the rest.&quot;

&quot;Roger,&quot; Ranma said, still chuckling at Misato&#39;s game attitude.

Before long, the newly painted midnight-blue and green Eva caught up to 
the giant Jet Alone mecha and grabbed hold of it. Ranma reached out and 
placed Misato on the robot&#39;s back. Misato grabbed the handholds and 
began to scale the machine toward the personnel access located at the 
top.

&quot;Careful, Misato,&quot; Ranma cautioned as she slipped and barely caught 
herself from a nasty fatal fall.

Misato regained her footing and shot Ranma a quick wink and a victory 
sign before resuming her climb. Once at the top, she popped the access 
hatch and slipped inside. Ranma repositioned Unit 01 to block Jet 
Alone&#39;s forward progress.

Placing the Eva&#39;s hands on Jet Alone&#39;s chest, Ranma planted the Eva&#39;s 
feet and braced. Jet Alone continued to move forward a short ways, the 
Eva&#39;s feet sliding back along the ground. Growling, Ranma shifted his 
grip. Dropping lower, the Eva&#39;s arms locked around Jet Alone&#39;s waist and 
Ranma placed the Eva&#39;s shoulder against Jet Alone&#39;s lower torso. With a 
grunt, Ranma heaved the giant mecha off its feet, halting its progress.

Inside, Misato bounced off a bulkhead, cursing.

&quot;Dammit, Ranma, hold this thing still,&quot; she yelled as the floor canted 
and set her sliding again.

&quot;Sorry, Misato,&quot; Ranma apologized. &quot;I got it now. You should be good.&quot;

Misato picked herself up and carefully made her way to the computer 
terminal along the canted deck. Pulling up the login screen, she entered 
the password. After a pregnant pause, the screen flashed that access was 
denied.

&quot;It&#39;s not accepting the password!&quot; Misato reported. &quot;I&#39;m going to try 
again. Come on you piece of junk take the code. Man, it&#39;s hot in here.&quot;

While Misato was trying to access the computer, Ranma had an idea. He 
slipped into the Soul of Ice and forced it into his AT field and into 
Jet Alone. The temperature rise slowed, buying them some time before the 
reactor went into meltdown.

&quot;The temperature rise is slowing,&quot; one of the techs monitoring Jet Alone 
reported.

&quot;Have the control rods been reinserted?&quot; the lead scientist asked.

&quot;Negative,&quot; the tech reported. &quot;I can&#39;t explain it. The whole thing just 
seems to be cooling down from the outside. Whatever it is, it&#39;s not 
enough though. It&#39;ll buy us some time, but that&#39;s about it.&quot;

Inside Jet Alone, Misato breathed a sigh of relief as a wave of cool 
washed over her. She continued to attempt to access the system but, 
again, it denied her access. Punching the terminal in frustration, she 
decided on another plan.

&quot;I can&#39;t access the system,&quot; Misato reported. &quot;I&#39;m gonna try something 
else.&quot;

&quot;Just hurry,&quot; Ranma said in a strained tone. &quot;I&#39;m not sure how much 
longer I can hold this thing and keep the Soul of Ice up.&quot;

&quot;Roger,&quot; Misato said as she moved over to the extended control rods.

Grunting with effort, she began to try and push the rods back in. 
Slowly, too slowly, the first rod began to move as Misato put every 
ounce of force she could muster behind it. Once she got that one in her 
muscles and joints shrieked in agony at being taxed to their limits.

After about 3 minutes, Misato had managed to force only one of the rods 
back in. She had just moved to the next one when Ranma spoke up sounding 
exhausted.

&quot;I can&#39;t hold the Soul of Ice at this level anymore, Misato,&quot; Ranma 
gasped out apologetically. &quot;Hope it was enough...&quot; He trailed off, only 
keeping Jet Alone held off the ground in the Eva&#39;s grasp by force of 
will.

Misato felt the temperature spike rapidly as Ranma dropped his 
technique. Urgently, she began to push on the next rod, but her body was 
failing her. She strained fruitlessly against the rod as sweat dripped 
into her eyes.

&#39;This is it,&#39; Misato thought as tears began to run down her cheeks to 
mix with the sweat. &#39;This is where I&#39;m gonna die. At least Ranma will be 
protected by the AT field.&#39;

Misato slumped against the wall as she watched the temperature readout 
reach the meltdown point. Just before it did though, the control rods 
suddenly retracted themselves and the reactor shut down. She sighed in 
relief, but Misato was too tired to do more than that.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ritsuko sighed as she closed her laptop. Gendo wasn&#39;t going to be happy, 
but Ritsuko, while willing to follow through with the plan initially, 
found herself unwilling to sacrifice her friend or risk Ranma&#39;s AT field 
not protecting him and Unit 01. A city full of strangers is one thing, 
her friends were quite another.

That didn&#39;t mean she was looking forward to explaining this to Gendo. 
While she knew that she was too important to NERV for Gendo to do 
anything...extreme...she knew that going against the man&#39;s plans was not 
generally healthy and not just to one&#39;s career.

Perhaps Ranma was right. Perhaps she should start watching her back 
around Gendo Ikari. It wasn&#39;t lost on her that he was perfectly willing 
to sacrifice Misato and risk harm to Ranma and Unit 01, both of which 
were integral to his plans, just to discredit the Jet Alone project. 
Yes, in the future, she would watch her back around the manipulative 
bastard.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma sighed heavily. It was Sunday and everyone had the day off. Well, 
almost everyone, Ranma corrected himself as Misato called for him from 
her bedroom. She had been a perfect pain in the ass since the day 
following the Jet Alone incident when she woke up to discover the price 
she had paid for her efforts. Misato was convalescing in her bed, unable 
to move without a significant amount of pain thanks to the bruising and 
strained or pulled muscles she had received for her efforts. Somehow, 
she had come to the conclusion that it was Ranma&#39;s responsibility to 
nurse her back to health.

&quot;Yeah, whadda ya want now, Misato?&quot; Ranma asked with a tone of 
resignation.

&quot;I was wondering if you could give me another of those wonderful 
rubdowns,&quot; Misato mewled pathetically, while giving him a little girl 
pout.

Ranma rolled his eyes.

&quot;Yeah, sure, Misato,&quot; Ranma sighed again. &quot;I&#39;ll just go get some water.&quot;

&quot;Could you please do it in that form,&quot; Misato pleaded, turning the pout 
on him again.

&quot;Okay, Misato, just this one time,&quot; Ranma growled, picking up the 
liniment. &quot;But it&#39;s been three days. It&#39;s my day off and I don&#39;t plan on 
spendin&#39; it around here waitin&#39; on you hand and foot.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re absolutely right, Ranma,&quot; Misato beamed. &quot;After you give me my 
rubdown, you can set me up on the balcony with a cooler of beer and you 
can go do whatever you like.&quot;

Ranma gulped as Misato levered herself up and painfully peeled off her 
shirt before laying face down on her futon clad in only her, rather 
skimpy, panties. When Ranma had protested this the first time, Misato 
had dismissed the protest since Ranma had his own set of female body 
parts and Misato couldn&#39;t see any reason why she should be any more 
modest than she would be in front of any other woman. Of course, Ranma 
had been in girl form at the time, but evidently Misato wasn&#39;t making a 
distinction.

On the other hand, Ranma figured she was probably enjoying teasing him, 
especially with the way she would moan his name sensually as he worked 
the analgesic into her sore muscles. It was effective too. Misato was 
without a doubt a certifiable babe, like his perverted friends were so 
fond of pointing out. It took every bit of Ranma&#39;s self-control not to 
show a reaction to having her soft skin under his hands.

Ranma had to smirk though. She may have enjoyed teasing him, but she 
ended up being the one frustrated. He knew a lot of massage techniques 
and pressure points that he had learned from Doctor Toufuu. Some of them 
were quite sensual when used just so. Thanks to his familiarity with the 
female body, Ranma was quite aware of the effect he was having on 
Misato, knowing the signs to look for, both in her ki and her body. Yes, 
she may have been teasing him, but she was the one left with damp 
panties, flushed and panting with arousal.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma finished with Misato, leaving her a quivering mass of frustrated 
female hormones and went to clean up. After washing the liniment off his 
hands, he walked by Rei&#39;s room to see her laying on her futon staring at 
the ceiling. It was the same position she had been in since completing 
their morning workout and finishing breakfast.

&quot;Rei?&quot; Ranma asked from the door.

She looked over at him.

&quot;Are you going to stay there all day?&quot; Ranma asked the blue-haired girl. 
&quot;I mean, it&#39;s your day off. Don&#39;t you wanna do anything for fun?&quot;

&quot;I do not understand,&quot; Rei replied. &quot;We have completed our morning 
training and have had breakfast. What else are we required to do?&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s sort of the point,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;We don&#39;t have to do 
anything. We can do somethin&#39; just for fun.&quot;

&quot;I do not understand,&quot; Rei said.

&quot;You mean you&#39;ve never done anything that you weren&#39;t ordered to just 
because it made you feel happy?&quot; Ranma asked.

Rei cogitated on this for a while before a light blush bloomed on her 
face. She had indeed done things she wasn&#39;t ordered to because they made 
her feel good, but for some reason, she was reluctant to tell the 
pigtailed pilot about them.

&quot;No,&quot; Rei said at last.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s about time you started,&quot; Ranma grinned cheerfully. &quot;Come on. 
Get up and get dressed. I&#39;m gonna introduce you to the art of having 
fun, starting with an education in the joys of ice cream!&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

A half an hour later found two girls walking down the street. They 
appeared to be polar opposites of each other. One had light blue hair 
and crimson eyes while the other had vibrant crimson hair and bright 
blue eyes. It didn&#39;t stop there. While one was stoic and reserved, with 
her face in a neutral set, the other had an easy smile and a vivacious 
attitude.

Rei was wearing a pair of powder-blue shorts and a red top that was 
short enough to flash glimpses of her flat midriff. On her feet were her 
strappy, white sandals. Ranma was wearing a pair of black, stretch, 
denim shorts and an azure blue, tailored, sleeveless top that displayed 
her impressive assets nicely. The neckline was low enough for a 
tantalizing hint of cleavage to be seen. She was also wearing a pair of 
strappy sandals except hers were black.

The redhead was currently engaged in an animated explanation of the 
finer points of scoring extra treats by use of the devastating 
&quot;doe-eyed&quot; technique. This technique could be used with great effect 
when coupled with the judicious application of the &quot;chest bounce&quot; 
technique, which, the redhead assured the stoic blue-haired girl, was 
enough to send any male ice cream attendant with a libido scrambling to 
provide an extra scoop of Turtle Tracks, extra fruit in a parfait, or 
double the hot fudge on a sundae or banana split.

After a demonstration of the techniques, Rei was forced to conclude that 
they were indeed effective as even she was filled with the desire to 
make her redheaded companion happy, even if she didn&#39;t fully understand 
how. She also wondered why it suddenly felt uncomfortably warm out.

The girls had just reached the entertainment district when they saw two 
familiar boys.

&quot;Hey Toji. Hey Kensuke,&quot; Ranma chirped cheerfully.

The two in question turned toward the girl who had greeted them. 
Catching sight of Ranma and Rei, their jaws dropped.

&quot;R-Ranma?&quot; Toji stammered. &quot;Uh...hi. W-what&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;Rei and I were just going for some ice cream,&quot; Ranma explained.

&quot;W-why are you a girl?&quot; Toji blurted. &quot;And why are you dressed like 
that?&quot;

&quot;Oh this ole thing?&quot; Ranma smiled mischievously. &quot;I just threw this on. 
Anyway, ice cream tastes much better as a girl. I dunno why, but it 
does. Chocolate becomes like a religious experience.&quot;

Ranma&#39;s face took on a dreamy look as she contemplated the virtues of 
chocolate. The two boys felt their hormone levels spike in spite of the 
fact they knew Ranma was a guy...mostly.

&quot;W-would you mind if we joined you?&quot; Kensuke stuttered, trying 
desperately to keep from blushing.

&quot;Sure, why not,&quot; Ranma chirped happily.

(oO\O/Oo)

Fifteen minutes later, the two boys gaped as Ranma was engaged in the 
sensual experience of wolfing down a bowl of ice cream of monolithic 
proportions. Rei sat beside her, across from the boys, having her own 
religious experience. While her serving wasn&#39;t nearly as large as 
Ranma&#39;s and she hadn&#39;t been able to bring herself to employ the 
techniques Ranma had demonstrated, she had still netted a double portion 
of hot fudge and an extra cherry because Ranma had ordered hers for her 
since she had no idea what to order. Not that she knew any better, never 
having had such a confection before.

With her first spoonful, Rei discovered nirvana. Surely, this was the 
food of the gods. Rei had actually whimpered in pleasure as the sweet, 
creamy taste exploded on her palette. Glancing over, she found Ranma&#39;s 
sparkling blue-gray eyes meeting hers. The redhead sported a wide, 
knowing smile, which prompted Rei&#39;s face to bloom into her first true 
smile.

For Ranma, seeing Rei&#39;s smile of true pleasure, which not only graced 
her lips but was also reflected in her eyes, was a thing of beauty. It 
made Ranma unbelievably happy to have been the one to put that smile on 
the stoic girl&#39;s face. That alone made it worth all her efforts to 
befriend the blue-haired girl.

The boys could only look on in shock at seeing Rei acting like a real 
person rather than the emotionless automaton they had become familiar 
with from class. For the first time they saw how attractive she really 
was. They were both in awe, both of Rei and of Ranma who seemed to have 
melted the ice maiden somehow.

&quot;So boys,&quot; Ranma grinned as she polished off her ice cream, &quot;my mission 
today is to teach Rei how to have a little fun. I got to thinkin&#39; 
though; I&#39;m not much an authority on that myself. My idea of fun has 
always been trainin&#39; or fightin&#39;. I&#39;m curious what normal people do for 
fun. You guys got any ideas?&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

As it happened the guys did have some ideas. Toji seemed to have the 
best ones since Kensuke&#39;s ideas of fun were running around in the woods 
playing war or ogling military equipment. Ranma had nixed the &quot;laser 
tag&quot; and arcade ideas due to that being a little too close to what they 
did at NERV. Thus the pair of girls and the two boys found themselves 
playing miniature golf.

This was something that Ranma found herself enjoying a lot. The various 
challenges presented tested her skills and made for some humorous 
blunders on behalf of the guys. Neither of them could compete with Rei&#39;s 
logical analysis of the angles and trajectories necessary to put the 
ball on course for the hole nor Ranma&#39;s intuitive understanding of the 
same and her precision in hitting the ball on target.

Kensuke was currently taking his turn when things became interesting.

&quot;Toji!&quot; a female voice called out.

Everyone turned to see Hikari Horaki approaching the group. The girl 
shot a withering glare at Ranma before she smiled brightly at Toji.

&quot;Hi Toji,&quot; the girl said brightly. &quot;What are you doing here? Who&#39;s your 
date? I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen her around before.&quot;

Toji laughed nervously.

&quot;Oh, um this is Ranma...&quot; Toji started before Ranma interrupted.

&quot;I&#39;m Ranma&#39;s sister, Ranko,&quot; Ranma said quickly. &quot;And he ain&#39;t my date. 
They are just showing Rei and me some places to have fun around here.&quot;

Hikari blinked, then blinked again. She was trying to wrap her mind 
around someone using Rei and fun in the same sentence and was failing 
miserably.

&quot;I...see,&quot; the confused girl said faintly before brightening. &quot;Then you 
won&#39;t mind if I join you then?&quot; Not only would she get to spend some 
social time with Toji, but Rei having fun was just something she had to 
witness for herself.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Ranma chirped. &quot;The more the merrier.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

By the end of the day, the five teens had managed to have a lot of fun 
together. Toji and Kensuke had left the three girls to head home when 
Hikari took the opportunity to ask about something she had noticed.

&quot;Ranko?&quot; the brunette asked hesitantly as they walked together. &quot;Why do 
Toji, Kensuke, and Rei all call you Ranma sometimes?&quot;

Ranma sighed heavily before looking at the girl speculatively.

&quot;Ya wouldn&#39;t believe me if I told ya,&quot; Ranma said finally. &quot;Look, I 
don&#39;t want this to get out all over the school &#39;cause it would just 
cause me problems. Can I trust ya to keep it a secret?&quot;

&quot;I-I suppose so,&quot; Hikari said, confused. She wondered what the girl had 
to tell her. It couldn&#39;t be that she was a lesbian. Her brother pretty 
much declared that on the first day of class. Come to think of it, 
Hikari never saw the girl in any classes at school.

&quot;Hikari, I am Ranma,&quot; Ranma said.

The class rep couldn&#39;t have been more shocked. All she could do was 
stare at the obviously insane girl. There was no way in hell the petite 
redhead was that hunky guy in drag. As the redhead began to explain 
about Chinese curses and magic, Hikari began to wonder if the reason she 
hadn&#39;t seen the girl in school was because she had escaped from some 
mental institution.

&quot;Well, I can see ya don&#39;t believe me,&quot; Ranma grinned wryly. &quot;I can prove 
it if you want to stop by for a few minutes.&quot;

&quot;This I have to see,&quot; Hikari replied.

Twenty minutes later, Hikari was coming to with the scent of smelling 
salts in her nose.

&quot;Believe me now?&quot; Ranma asked. &quot;And please don&#39;t go accusin&#39; me of being 
some kind of pervert. I never asked for this but I&#39;m stuck with it. 
Believe me, I know too much about what dealing with perverts is like to 
even think of acting that way myself.&quot;

&quot;This is...weird,&quot; Hikari said.

&quot;Heh, tell me about it,&quot; Ranma snorted. &quot;You should see what it&#39;s like 
from this end. I know more about girls than any guy has a right to. It&#39;s 
really important that you don&#39;t tell anyone about this. Once it got out 
at my old school the showers became a nightmare. Even though I beat the 
crap out of anyone who tried it, the fact that there was a gorgeous 
naked girl just a splash of cold water away was too much for most of 
those perverts to resist.&quot;

&quot;Oh my,&quot; Hikari said with wide-eyes. &quot;I never thought of that. It must 
have been awful.&quot;

&quot;It was, believe me,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;If I wasn&#39;t the best martial artist 
in Japan there&#39;s no telling how many times I would have been sexually 
assaulted.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Hikari assured him. &quot;I won&#39;t tell anyone. Thanks for 
trusting me with your secret. I have to ask, why were you a girl today?&quot;

&quot;Because Rei and I were going for ice cream when we ran into Toji and 
Kensuke,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;They both know, by the way, so you don&#39;t 
have to worry about me and Toji. It&#39;s pretty obvious that you got a 
thing for him.&quot; Hikari blushed. &quot;Anyway, I always eat ice cream in girl 
form because for some reason it tastes a lot better that way.&quot;

&quot;Oh, well, that&#39;s nice to know,&quot; Hikari smiled. &quot;You should call me up 
the next time you go out for ice cream. Then I can show you and Rei what 
girls do for fun.&quot;

&quot;You mean it? You don&#39;t think I&#39;m some sort of freak and you wanna be my 
friend?&quot; Ranma asked in surprise.

&quot;Sure, why not?&quot; Hikari asked.

&quot;It&#39;s just that most girls feel like I&#39;m trying to take advantage of 
them because of the curse,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;They tend to get a bit 
violent, like I went out of my way to deceive them. But I&#39;m not like 
that. I know a guy that turns into a little black piglet and he uses it 
to slip into a girl&#39;s bed to sleep with her and to nuzzle her breasts. 
It makes me really mad when it happens but I can&#39;t say anything to her 
because before he started deceiving her, I had promised him on my honor 
that I wouldn&#39;t tell anyone about it because he&#39;s pretty much helpless 
in that form.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s horrible,&quot; Hikari said in disgust. &quot;And the way he used your 
word of honor against you makes him a complete low-life as well as a 
cad. It must have been hard for you not to say anything.&quot;

&quot;I tried giving hints and stuff, but the girl never could catch on,&quot; 
Ranma shook his head sadly. &quot;The worst part about it was she always took 
his side over mine and would get mad at me when the guy attacked me 
either as a guy or as her pet pig.&quot;

&quot;Well, I must say, his curse suited his true personality,&quot; Hikari 
commented. &quot;Anyway, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re anything like that. You&#39;re 
probably the one guy that can really understand what it&#39;s like for a 
girl. I think that&#39;s kinda neat, so yes, I wouldn&#39;t mind hanging out 
with you and Rei.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ranma smiled, glancing over at Rei, who also gave Hikari a 
small smile.

(oO\O/Oo)

Akane held P-chan up by the bandana and looked into the piglet&#39;s eyes. 
They were wide and full of fear. She shakily reached over and picked up 
her cup of tea and dumped it on the struggling piglet.

&quot;You unbelievable BASTARD!&quot; Akane screamed at the naked Ryoga as her 
aura exploded around her.

Jumping to her feet she produced the biggest mallet ever seen, 
mallet-sama plus 5 verses perverts. It had a depleted uranium core with 
titanium faces and was guaranteed to put the smack down on Godzilla. 
Thor would have been proud to wield it. Ryoga began running. Akane began 
to pursue. The rest of the people in the room cheered Akane on as her 
rage was being directed at a deserving target this time.

Everyone except Shampoo, who seemed oddly subdued. Cologne looked at her 
great granddaughter in sympathy. She had long known that the girl 
wouldn&#39;t be the one to capture Ranma&#39;s heart, but that was a brutal way 
to find out the man you loved didn&#39;t return the sentiment. Not that she 
blamed Ranma. She knew the boy was too kind-hearted to be that cruel 
intentionally, but he had no way of knowing that they were watching his 
adventure.

Cologne suspected that all the girls would be hearing a few harsh truths 
about where they stood in Ranma&#39;s candid thoughts. She just hoped for 
their sake the truth wouldn&#39;t be as cruel as hearing the man they loved 
say he would just as soon forget about them.</pre>
