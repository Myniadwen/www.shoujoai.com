<h1>Mai HiMACE (part 3 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/226.html">22671991</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/himace-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;Good evening,&quot; answered a smooth, deep masculine voice. &quot;I&#39;ll assume 
since only a select few know of this number, that you know who I am. And 
just who might this be?&quot;

&quot;My name&#39;s not really important, is it? Besides, I think I&#39;d prefer our 
relationship to be fully anonymous. Makes it easier for both of us, 
wouldn&#39;t you say?&quot; The voice on the line chuckled for a while at that 
one. Natsuki smiled. At least her initial information had been correct; 
whoever he was, he had a strange sense of humour. &quot;I&#39;ve looked all over 
the city for you,&quot; she continued. &quot;I&#39;d hope that you&#39;re as good as your 
reputation would have me believe, because I can just as easily take my 
business elsewhere.&quot;

&quot;I can get you absolutely anything,&quot; replied the voice. &quot;But only a 
handful of people can get you this number. Which makes me wonder just 
how you got hold of me...&quot;

&quot;A blind guess,&quot; lied Natsuki, grinning sardonically. The voice chuckled 
back at her.

&quot;A lady with a sense of humour. I admire that. So what can I do for you 
then, hm?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;ve been reports of strange animal sightings in Tokyo lately...&quot; 
There was a moment of silence. That moment stretched, longer and longer, 
until Natsuki finally frowned and started tapping her fingers 
impatiently on the metal case in front of her. &quot;Still there?&quot;

&quot;I know who you are,&quot; said the voice somewhat briskly, &quot;and what you 
want. Don&#39;t hang up, this is important.&quot;

&quot;Why should I trust you?&quot;

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t. In fact...you shouldn&#39;t trust anyone. Even people you 
know. Take my word for it.&quot;

Natsuki tried to laugh sarcastically but it didn&#39;t quite sound right. 
There was something strangely compelling in that tone of voice. &quot;Awfully 
hypocritical of you, isn&#39;t that?&quot;

&quot;Just be quiet and listen.&quot; Natsuki obeyed, though she was rapidly 
becoming more and more annoyed. Her foot tapped on the concrete 
impatiently as she leaned against the booth, gazing across the road at a 
small fast-food diner. &quot;The Tokyo 6th District Public Bank isn&#39;t what it 
seems. These things you&#39;re looking for, you won&#39;t find them there. But 
you will find something else. Something even more important 
than...Orphans.&quot;

Natsuki whirled round. &quot;How do you...!&quot; she began sharply, then pushed 
her voice down. &quot;Who gave you that name? Are you with the First 
District?&quot;

The voice chuckled at her again. &quot;I can get everything. Anything and 
everything there is to get. And a few unobtainable things too, if the 
price is right. Where I got the name is unimportant. And you might want 
to rethink your preconceptions of the First District.&quot;

&quot;Then what is?&quot; hissed Natsuki impatiently.

&quot;Listen, and listen carefully. I&#39;m going to hang up. You&#39;ll go across 
the road, talk to the waitress standing outside that diner, the one in 
the pink skirt. Act casual.&quot; Natsuki snorted, but remained quiet. 
&quot;Mention the word &quot;Kansai&quot; to her and she&#39;ll give you a key.&quot; There was 
another pause, much shorter this time. Natsuki felt her impatience 
growing by the second, as was her innate curiosity. &quot;At exactly twelve 
fifteen tomorrow night, the security system at the 6th District Public 
Bank will go offline. All the guards will be called away. Don&#39;t ask why, 
just be there. You&#39;ll have twenty minutes to get in and out...with your 
prize.&quot;

&quot;And that prize would be what, exactly?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll find out,&quot; laughed the voice. &quot;Just remember...act casual. 
They&#39;re watching you all the time.&quot;

Natsuki frowned again. &quot;What? What do you mean...&quot; She hissed and 
slammed the phone back down when all she got back was a dial tone. 
&quot;Jerk.&quot;

She looked across the road at that run-down bomb shelter of a diner and 
sure enough, there were several beaten up wooden tables standing 
outside, like picnic benches. A young woman in a strange uniform was 
slowly polishing one of the tables with a wadded up cloth, a tin in her 
other hand. She was wearing a pink miniskirt that clearly didn&#39;t go with 
the rest of the outfit.

Natsuki approached, cautiously, looking all around her for any sign of 
sinister goings-on. A black suited man was standing in front of one of 
the other payphones behind her now. An old lady was walking slowly down 
the street some distance away, her back towards the dark-haired woman. 
Nothing suspicious, though somehow that call had gotten her a little 
edgy all of a sudden. She kept looking behind her, expecting to see 
something bad rushing her way, but it never came.

She stopped in front of the diner and looked up at the broken neon sign 
flashing above the door. As casually as she could manage, she sighed and 
turned to one side, hands on her hips.

&quot;Excuse me?&quot;

The waitress in the pink skirt stopped her polishing and stood up, 
turning round slowly and looking over her shoulder. &quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry but...I think I&#39;m a little lost.&quot;

The young woman...no, she was closer to a girl, barely out of school 
yet. She smiled cheerfully at Natsuki and set her cleaning implements 
aside on the table. &quot;I&#39;d be happy to help, miss. Is there any place in 
particular you&#39;d like to be going?&quot;

&quot;I was looking for a garage. I&#39;m running a little low right now.&quot; She 
gestured out behind her to where her bike stood parked up against the 
phone booth.

The girl smiled at her even wider, her unnervingly red eyes sparkling, 
though something about the expression bothered Natsuki profoundly. &quot;A 
very nice machine, if I may say so miss, looks expensive indeed.&quot; She 
nodded. &quot;Well, I know there&#39;s a little place near here, it&#39;s just down 
the road.&quot; She pointed off in one direction. &quot;There&#39;s a sign about a 
hundred metres down, it&#39;s huge, you can&#39;t miss it. If you take a left 
there and then follow the road round, you&#39;ll come straight to it.&quot;

Natsuki nodded politely. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;Not many people getting lost in this place any more. You must not be 
from here, hm?&quot;

&quot;Kansai, actually,&quot; replied Natsuki, trying to hide a devious smirk.

The waitress showed little reaction. &quot;Well then, in that case...&quot; She 
reached into one pocket and pulled out a set of keys, and a small folded 
piece of paper. &quot;It&#39;s dangerous to go on alone around here. Take this.&quot;

Natsuki looked at her a little oddly for a moment. &quot;Erm...thank you.&quot; 
She took the offered items, stuffed them into one of the multitude of 
hidden pockets on the inside of her jacket and then turned away again.

The waitress smiled even wider and went straight back to work, humming 
some nameless tune to herself.

Once Natsuki was back on her bike and some way off into the distance, 
the waitress stopped again and stood straight. Her smile melted off like 
water running over a duck&#39;s back, revealing a blank emotionless 
expression underneath. Her eyes, though, were as bright and sparkling as 
before as she gathered a handful of breadcrumbs from the small plastic 
bag in her pocket and scattered them over a table.

She smiled, the very tiniest of smiles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Moko-chan?&quot;

Motoko pushed her glasses up her nose with the tip of one finger and 
leaned back into her chair a little more, away from the computer screen 
before her. She turned round to face the source of that familiar voice 
and found Shizuru standing right behind her, practically crowded over 
the chair. Her hand surreptitiously adjusted the top button of her 
blouse, and the older woman chuckled to herself with an impish grin.

&quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; intoned the blonde in her usual borderline-derisive monotone 
voice, failing to appear anything except contemptuously bored.

&quot;You&#39;re not too busy right now, are you Moko-chan?&quot;

Motoko stared, the stare that was reserved for when her superior made 
some sort of blatant sexual allusion. It was unnervingly similar to the 
stare she gave practically everything Shizuru said. She pushed her 
glasses back up her nose with one finger and waited patiently, since 
there was no come-back that would put off Shizuru&#39;s rampant juvenile 
sense of humour.

&quot;I&#39;ve got a little job for you, Moko-chan,&quot; the brunette woman explained 
cheerfully, her face lit up in a way that could only really mean that 
trouble was coming. She pointed towards the computer and continued, &quot;I 
know you can get me the records for all the patients under my staff, 
past and present, for which I&#39;m very grateful by the way. But I was 
wondering perhaps...could you get me the room records for D-twelve?&quot;

Motoko blinked, thoroughly confused, though her expression showed little 
change from the usual bored cynicism. &quot;D-twelve? But that&#39;s Yasata-san&#39;s 
section, isn&#39;t it, up in the pharmacology department...?&quot;

&quot;Well, yes...&quot; Shizuru pouted; it was disgustingly effective, on anyone 
besides her secretary. &quot;You see, there&#39;s just this little problem of the 
two men guarding room thirteen-forty-two. They&#39;ve been there every time 
I&#39;ve gone past and, the trouble is, nobody has ever mentioned them to me 
at all.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not the sector administrator y&#39;know, ma&#39;am,&quot; sighed Motoko.

&quot;Well it&#39;s still suspicious, considering that I asked Hajima-kun and he 
said that that room is listed as a temporary storage room for cleaning 
supplies.&quot; She chuckled again when Motoko&#39;s eyebrows shot straight up 
her forehead. &quot;I knew that would get your curiosity going.&quot;

The blonde coughed sharply. &quot;It&#39;s none of your business, ma&#39;am, and it&#39;s 
none of mine. You should just leave it up to Yasata-san to deal with.&quot;

Shizuru cocked her head to one side ever so slightly, a curious 
expression on her face. &quot;Hm? Where&#39;s your sense of adventure, 
Moko-chan?&quot; she teased, poking the blonde&#39;s shoulder with a finger. 
&quot;Besides, it is pretty suspicious, if you ask me. Suspicious things 
bother me, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;I said you should drop it...ma&#39;am.&quot; Motoko stared up at her for a 
moment quite intensely. The older woman felt some inexplicable tension 
in the air and took a hesitant step backward, carefully not showing her 
uneasiness on her face.

&quot;You&#39;re right, Motoko,&quot; she sighed at last, smiling reassuringly. &quot;I&#39;ll 
ask Yasata again when I see him next, just to be sure. And that&#39;ll be 
that, eh?&quot;

The blonde turned back to her workstation and carried on with her duties 
in silence. That deep, pervading awkwardness hung in the air like a 
thick blanket, so Shizuru withdrew hastily back through the office door 
before suspicion overcame her and strode away down the corridor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a warm, sunny Friday evening in Tokyo&#39;s 12th District, just like 
every other Friday evening in summer. The air was still scorching hot 
outside and thick with moisture, and the sun was still startlingly high 
in the late afternoon sky. The sky was slowly turning from its usual 
pale blue to that deep fiery orange of sunset, and the clouds were 
gradually coagulating into a thick, uniform greyness high above the 
city, edged with highlights in gold and red and pink that made for quite 
the interesting visual pattern. The shadows were growing longer as the 
sun sank back behind the Tokyo downtown skyline and everything was 
slowly being swallowed by that strange haze of orange light that always 
suffused through Japanese summer evenings.

The Jogousaki apartment building was every bit as dull and ugly as ever, 
just that plain grey brick-shaped lump of concrete that sat sandwiched 
between several alike concrete lumps. The very few front windows that 
faced out onto the main road were all dark, curtains or blinds left open 
and no signs of life therein, all bar one. One, on the corner of the 
third floor, was covered over by a rather weak looking set of horizontal 
blinds in the same drab grey as the building walls, through which leaked 
warm orange-yellow artificial light from within. Thankfully, the window 
was closed, though there were few neighbours who might actually think to 
complain of the noise had it been open.

Natsuki tried her best to look casually disdainful, arms folded over her 
chest and an annoyed look on her face, her bottom lip pouting as it 
always did when she found herself in such uncomfortable quarters.

&quot;Just why, exactly, am I here again?&quot;

Mai looked across at her houseguest, or more like apartment-guest, and 
frowned. Or pouted. It was one of the two, or it was both, or it was 
somewhere between and neither. Mai certainly had a talent for 
complicated facial expressions.

&quot;Karaoke!&quot; she declared a little more loudly than was absolutely 
necessary. She thrust one finger into the air imperiously and tossed her 
head back slightly, which only made her hair flutter about restlessly. 
&quot;And to loosen that uptight attitude of yours a little. You need some 
Midori-chan style teaching from a disciple herself.&quot;

&quot;Alright, you don&#39;t have to shout,&quot; Natsuki bit back at her sharply. &quot;I 
can hear fine, even with that damn noise.&quot; She thumbed over her shoulder 
at where Mikoto was busy watching some derogatory children&#39;s show or 
other on possibly the smallest portable television in existence, volume 
cranked right up to compensate for the terrible reception.

Mai blushed slightly, though she had been that way for an hour or so 
now, and waved her hand dismissively. &quot;Oh, shut up, you!&quot; She sat back 
into her chair with a whump and adjusted the hem of her skirt, which had 
worked up a little too high with all her getting up and down and 
shuffling about and pointing and such.

&quot;You really shouldn&#39;t ever drink sake again. Ever.&quot; Mai pouted and 
crossed her arms again. &quot;Really,&quot; insisted Natsuki, her nerves starting 
to fray. She wasn&#39;t one to talk, of course; she&#39;d already downed half a 
bottle herself. That had been before Mikoto had investigated, however, 
and then Mai had vowed that alcohol would be banned from the apartment 
for good, or until further notice. Or an emergency.

Natsuki shrugged. Not like it was her apartment or anything.

&quot;So,&quot; Mai repeated, poking the dark-haired girl in her shoulder. &quot;You 
going first or me?&quot;

Natsuki tried to brush the finger away and missed just barely, which 
certainly made her hesitate a second or two. Perhaps she should take a 
taxi home after all, instead of riding. &quot;You got me into this, so you go 
first,&quot; she insisted, shoving the slightly beaten-up handheld microphone 
towards the redhead. Mai snatched it from her hand with a precocious 
grin and stuck her chest out triumphantly.

&quot;Coward,&quot; she muttered.

Natsuki twitched angrily. &quot;What did you say?&quot;

Mai looked serenely innocent. &quot;Nothing...&quot;

Meanwhile, Mikoto was working on getting that stupid microscopic 
television tuned in a little better, fiddling back and forth with 
several very small knobs until the picture looked anywhere approaching 
coherent. Having no expertise with electrical appliances, or appliances 
in general, she was having not quite the best time of it. Her searching 
for a comedy channel she had seen a mere second&#39;s glimpse of before had 
ultimately yielded very little more than a news segment and something 
regarding cooking.

&quot;...routine training exercise brings the United Nations&#39; Pacific Third 
Fleet into close proximity with Chinese Territorial waters. The Chinese 
Republic government have made statements to the effect that any 
incursion will be seen as hostile action and that the Chinese military 
is prepared for retaliation. However, they have also promised the 
Chinese people, and the UN, that military action will be seen as an 
absolute last resort and that they will do everything they can to make 
sure this exercise remains peaceful.

In local news, a large shipment of canned fish has been lost from the 
Russian cargo ship Sakhalin several kilometres off the coast of Shikoku. 
According to sources, a large hole was discovered in the side of the 
ship just above the watermark late last night and, upon further 
investigation, several tons of canned tuna were found to be inexplicably 
missing. Police say there are very few leads to go on ...&quot;

Mikoto blinked. &quot;Cats,&quot; she said to herself, and then nodded. Yes, cats. 
Cats would steal tuna, even if it were canned. Her common sense refused 
to comment. &quot;Or an Orphan.&quot; But she had felt nothing all night, or the 
previous day, or at all for almost a week since they had destroyed the 
last creature, so that probably wasn&#39;t it.

&quot;Maybe someone was just really hungry?&quot; she mused idly to herself as she 
tried to change the channel.

Behind her, Natsuki was singing, not very well though she didn&#39;t seem to 
care too much. Mai was watching and trying her best not to laugh as the 
blue-haired girl threw her free hand about expressively while she sang, 
clearly putting everything she had into it if not more. Her voice rose 
and fell with the tune and her tongue followed the brisk pace with ease, 
but singing was clearly not her forte. The song being in English did 
little to help the problem.

She wore the same plain dark purple slacks she had worn when she had 
first arrived, though now her sweater was off and tied by its sleeves 
around her neck to flow back behind her like a cape. A sleeveless black 
blouse covered up most of her upper half, down to just above her 
midriff, leaving only a narrow gap between the hem and the waistband of 
her pants. Dark stocking-clad feet tapped against the wooden panel 
flooring as she sang along with the words on the screen.

Mai pouted and turned her eye to the window instead. &quot;Sexy...&quot; she 
whined under her breath. &quot;Maybe I should work out some more? Guys don&#39;t 
go for chubby girls these days...&quot;

Then Natsuki slipped on the polished wood flooring and fell right on top 
of her, and there was much commotion. Getting the athletic girl standing 
again took a little while thanks to the effect of alcohol on her 
equilibrium, but they managed without too much trouble. Natsuki missed 
almost a third of the next song, though she didn&#39;t seem to mind, and she 
threw herself straight into it with a vengeance.

&quot;She&#39;s so forceful, too,&quot; Mai pondered to no one in particular. Her eyes 
drifted about the room for a while as she listened to Natsuki&#39;s 
not-very-great singing, Mikoto still making a fuss in the background as 
she molested that poor portable television to death. The clock on the 
wall ticked away to itself quietly and the time rolled on as always.

&quot;I wonder if she has a boyfriend?&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Shizuru sneezed.

&quot;Now I know that wouldn&#39;t be Moko-chan, because she always says it to my 
face...&quot;

&quot;Er, Director?&quot;

She shook her head. &quot;No, sorry, please continue. Don&#39;t mind me.&quot; The 
doctor turned back to that young girl lying in bed, eyes shut, an 
intravenous tube in her left wrist, and carried on poking about her 
right hand with the pin.

&quot;She seems responsive enough to pain, so there&#39;s no nervous damage.&quot; He 
stepped back a short way and picked up the clipboard from where it sat 
on a table beside the bed. &quot;She&#39;s got some strange reflexes though. And 
getting the IV was oddly difficult. Her skin seems to be...I don&#39;t 
know...tougher than normal.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps you&#39;ve been on shift a little too long, Doctor,&quot; Shizuru 
offered in that soothingly cheerful voice of hers. &quot;You go get some 
coffee and I&#39;ll make sure she gets a fresh drip once that one runs out.&quot;

The man, somewhere in his early thirties and quite a striking visage 
under short-cropped brown hair, bowed his head respectfully and handed 
over a sheet of paper. &quot;I think you&#39;ll need to run through the section 
nurse though. None of our regular bags have some of this stuff in.&quot;

Shizuru took a quick glance over the list and blinked. &quot;I may not be a 
doctor myself...but I must say some of these are fairly odd.&quot;

&quot;Her body&#39;s dehydrated so badly, but when I tested her blood there 
were...well...aluminium pockets. And a few other transition metals in 
there too, nothing too dangerous mind you. But in her bloodstream?&quot; He 
sighed and shook his head. &quot;She&#39;s not showing any of the normal signs of 
blood poisoning and they&#39;re in very small amounts, so we&#39;re assuming 
it&#39;s normal for her. Whatever that means.&quot;

&quot;Wait...&quot; Shizuru tapped a finger against the X-ray picture hanging from 
the wall beside the bed, right over a strange dark blotch. &quot;This is a 
micro-image of the blood vessel you took the sample from, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re infallible, Fujino.&quot;

&quot;So what in the world is this...thing?&quot;

&quot;As far as I can tell, it&#39;s something dense and hard, floating in her 
blood. The MRI should give us a better picture but, to be completely 
honest, I have no idea what they could be.&quot;

&quot;They?&quot; Shizuru cocked an eyebrow.

The doctor held up his hands. &quot;You heard. There&#39;s dozens, maybe even 
hundreds of them. None in the samples I took, though, which is strange 
to say the very least.&quot;

&quot;Well, thank you Doctor. You go get your coffee, and make sure it&#39;s 
strong.&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; chuckled the man, and vanished through the open doorway.

Shizuru paused, then, and looked back down at that enigmatic young girl 
in the bed. Her face was pale, but dark red patches had broken out in 
random places on her neck, arms, her chest, practically everywhere but 
her feet and back. Her feet themselves were blistered terribly, as were 
her fingers and the palms of her hands. Her bright orange hair was in 
total disarray, twisted and knotted and frizzy all over, as if she had 
had her head stuck in an oven. Her eyes shifted restlessly under their 
lids, and her narrow lips were constantly squeezing shut and splitting 
open again, mouthing out silent words in her dreams. Her body was thin, 
bony even, almost malnourished under that flimsy hospital sheet, and 
showing only the beginnings of puberty. By the look of her alone and her 
diminutive stature, she couldn&#39;t be more than a teenager at the most.

Strangest of all was the piercing in her left ear; a small but ornate 
golden setting within which sat a perfectly rounded gemstone of shocking 
blue, glowing very gently under its own internal light.

Shizuru sighed. &quot;You certainly are a mysterious one, young lady. I hope 
you can explain yourself when you wake up...&quot; Then she turned and left 
the room, closing the door behind her.

The girl in the bed opened her lips again and spoke, her voice broken 
and weak.

&quot;Ni...na...&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Several hours later, it was clear that Natsuki would not be going home 
by herself. Mai refused to let her ride home for fear of some accident, 
which the dark-haired girl protested quite adamantly, and Natsuki 
herself bluntly refused to leave her bike in the redhead&#39;s care. Both 
women were working one another to a state of aggravation, until Mikoto, 
already yawning constantly, keeled over on the table and promptly fell 
fast asleep.

Mai blinked. &quot;It must be really late if Mikoto&#39;s falling asleep like 
that...&quot; She looked at the clock on the wall and groaned. &quot;Well...I 
suppose you could sleep here, at least you&#39;ll be close to your precious 
bike that way.&quot;

&quot;Probably better than the motels around here at least,&quot; Natsuki 
retorted, crossing her arms over her chest.

Mai poked her shoulder. &quot;Give over, already. It&#39;s too late now to be 
fighting.&quot;

&quot;I guess you&#39;re right. I know I&#39;m going to have a killer headache in the 
morning.&quot;

&quot;Ha!&quot;

Natsuki looked at the redhead with an indignant expression. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re not invincible after all!&quot;

&quot;Quiet, you.&quot;

Mai tossed her hands up. &quot;Forget it! Let&#39;s just...get some sleep 
already.&quot; She switched the karaoke machine off, though it took her two 
attempts to hit the switch, and then stood up a little unsteadily.

&quot;You really can&#39;t hold your drink.&quot;

&quot;Oh, shut up. If I&#39;d had a little more, I&#39;d be fine. Too little or too 
much makes me dizzy.&quot;

Natsuki sighed and shook her head as the other woman drifted across the 
room to where one wall was covered with several paper panels, like an 
old-fashioned Japanese house. She slid open a paper door and the light 
swept in, illuminating very little of a cavernous space behind the wall.

&quot;Wait...you sleep in your closet?&quot;

Mai looked over her shoulder with a shrug. &quot;What about it? Only space I 
had for the bed, though it&#39;s more just a mattress than a bed.&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t a futon be easier?&quot; replied Natsuki, walking up behind her.

&quot;Picky.&quot; Mai slithered inside and started stripping the sheets off the 
bed, which took quite some doing given the lack of space in her 
makeshift bedroom. The bed was, indeed, simply a thick mattress jammed 
in against the back wall, fitting neatly into one corner of the closet 
to leave space for a tiny wooden table on the opposite side. Mai was in 
the process of pulling a pale pink sheet out of its hiding place in a 
basket underneath the table when Natsuki noticed something odd.

&quot;Where...do you keep your clothes?&quot;

&quot;At my girlfriend&#39;s house.&quot; Mai grinned at her out of the darkness.

Natsuki felt her cheeks flushing despite her irritation. &quot;You&#39;re 
unbearable. No, I mean...really. Where do you put your clothes if you&#39;re 
using the closet for sleeping in?&quot;

&quot;See that hook in the ceiling?&quot; Mai replied as she wrestled with the 
sheet. Natsuki turned round to stare up over her head and, lo and 
behold, a series of small wooden slot handles in a circular pattern set 
into the concrete above her head. What was stranger was that they each 
sat in the centre of a roughly wedge-shaped panel of wood, which 
together formed a thick ring with one wide gap left in the middle bare 
concrete.

&quot;What the heck?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s my closet.&quot;

Natsuki stared at her. &quot;You&#39;re kidding.&quot;

&quot;Nope. That up there, that&#39;s full of all my clothes. Had to fold them 
real tight to get everything in and I&#39;m already running out of room.&quot;

Natsuki stared up for quite a while, so long in fact that Mai finished 
her job with time to spare, before she deigned to speak again. &quot;Who in 
the hell designed this place?&quot;

Mai shrugged. &quot;Beats me. The bed&#39;s ready, by the way. Or did you want a 
shower first?&quot;

Natsuki snorted at her. &quot;As if you could even fit one in this 
hamster-cage.&quot;

Mai grinned. &quot;Eh...actually, I usually use the local bath. It&#39;s so 
cramped in there I can&#39;t even turn around to wash my back. I&#39;m a little 
worried about Mikoto though.&quot;

&quot;Hm?&quot;

The redhead gestured to where Mikoto lay sprawled across the table, 
snoring loudly. &quot;I don&#39;t think she&#39;s been washed for days, weeks even 
maybe. And I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s ever even been to a public bath before. 
And of course, if I take her...&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t want people thinking she&#39;s your daughter, hm?&quot; Natsuki 
chuckled. &quot;You&#39;ve certainly got that kind of figure.&quot;

Mai put her hands on her hips. &quot;You shut up, you...you...lanky little 
girl.&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;re you calling skinny?&quot;

&quot;At least I&#39;ve got something to show off,&quot; Mai teased, cupping her hands 
under her prodigious chest. &quot;I don&#39;t know why you wear that suit, it 
just shows everyone how little you have to offer.&quot;

&quot;Well you seem to like it!&quot; Natsuki clapped a hand over her mouth as her 
face turned red. Mai just laughed at her.

&quot;Deviant!&quot;

&quot;Shut up! You started it!&quot;

&quot;Another few comments like that and I may just decide I like you after 
all.&quot; The redhead stepped aside and gestured to the open closet door. 
&quot;Your bed, ma&#39;am.&quot;

Natsuki turned her nose up and strode inside, sliding the door firmly 
shut behind herself. &quot;You better not come in here while I&#39;m asleep, 
you...pervert.&quot;

&quot;Go to sleep, damn it.&quot; Mai was still giggling as she folded out several 
thick towels onto the floor and then laid herself carefully down atop 
them, with one more to cover herself. It wasn&#39;t comfortable, but it 
would do none the less.

&quot;G&#39;night Mikoto-chan.&quot;

Mikoto grunted something unintelligible in reply.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mai woke up in another room. A strange room. A profoundly familiar room. 
Moonlight streamed in through the slits between horizontal blinds that 
hung across a single, wide window, almost as bright as day, casting a 
pale silver-blue hue over everything in sight. The bed beneath her was 
warm and inviting, if a little stiff. A second stood just an arm&#39;s 
length away to her left. There was a reassuring weight resting over her, 
draped across her stomach mostly, bare skin touching her flesh.

She sat up, slowly, and looked down. &quot;Where...am I?&quot;

&quot;Mai...&quot;

The lump atop her shifted and looked up toward her, bright yellow eyes 
glittering in the dim light.

&quot;Mikoto?&quot;

The young girl shook her head with a soft and somewhat sinister smile 
that was most definitely uncharacteristic of Mikoto. She held one finger 
up to her lips. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s just a dream.&quot;

&quot;Is this...am I remembering something? Something...from before?&quot;

&quot;As I said, this is just a dream.&quot;

Mai blinked.

&quot;Or a fantasy, maybe,&quot; finished Natsuki as she slowly crawled her way up 
Mai&#39;s body. &quot;A fantasy you can&#39;t remember having. Or maybe you&#39;re just 
repressed?&quot;

&quot;Maybe I&#39;m insane...&quot;

A finger brushed her lips, and Mai knew it wasn&#39;t real, that strange 
ethereal feeling that drifted over her face. &quot;Maybe I&#39;m really just your 
subconscious, trying to tell you something.&quot; Mai blinked, and realised 
she was facing a mirror image of her own body, shockingly naked and 
highlighted nicely by the moonlight streaming in. &quot;You imaged that kid 
first. Maybe you&#39;re feeling unloved? Maybe you want to start a family 
yourself, hm?&quot;

&quot;Then...I&#39;m just lonely?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d say horny, myself,&quot; giggled the mysterious shape-changing figure. 
&quot;The way you chased Tate around even while you denied him...&quot; The image 
changed again into a tall, rather handsome young man with bright blonde 
hair that stood from his head in a ragged mess, much like Mikoto&#39;s. Most 
of his face was shadowed, but a lecherous smirk shone through.

Mai paused.

&quot;...who?&quot;

Then everything went black. When she opened her eyes again some time 
later, things were profoundly different.

The sky was red like blood, as was the sea. Dark, cold, and foreboding 
to an extreme. There was a most disturbing sound far too close for 
comfort, like scorching hot air blowing rhythmically through an endless 
cavern. It almost sounded like breathing. Somewhere in the distance, a 
female voice was screaming or laughing hysterically, or both, Mai 
couldn&#39;t be sure.

&quot;What...&quot; Mai tried to turn her head, but her eyes were locked in one 
place, gazing out over the crimson ocean before her towards a small dark 
speck on the horizon. &quot;Where is this? What&#39;s...going on?&quot;

&quot;Welcome back again, Mai-chan,&quot; replied a voice that she instantly 
loathed for reasons that escaped her. &quot;Nice to see you back so soon.&quot;

&quot;Who are you? Where are you?&quot;

&quot;This is just a dream, Mai, remember?&quot;

A young boy with short blue hair appeared before her with a smile and a 
wave. He turned his back on her and looked straight out over the water 
himself, towards that dark shape that was rapidly growing larger and 
larger.

&quot;Then...you&#39;re not who I think you are,&quot; Mai reasoned to herself, though 
it didn&#39;t sound very convincing even to her.

&quot;I have to admire you, Mai-chan. You&#39;ve faced some horrible things in 
the past.&quot; The boy turned again to face her, and grinned again. In the 
blink of an eye, Mai found her mother standing in his place before her 
very eyes.

&quot;What&#39;s coming next is even worse. You&#39;ll see.&quot;

As the apparition walked away along the beach, Mai could only gasp in 
amazement. At last, she could make out what that dark blotch really 
was...

...a sight that filled her with terror.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mai woke with a start, thankfully not enough to roll her out of her 
makeshift bed and onto the hard floor below. It took her a moment to 
register the feeling of weight draped over her stomach, and then she sat 
up rather quickly indeed, arms flailing out to her sides.

Mikoto yelped and rolled off her comfy nesting spot, then fell asleep 
again almost immediately. Mai was somehow not quite surprised.

She stood up, slowly, carefully, and extricated her feet from the 
tangled mess of her improvised bedding one by one. The wooden floor was 
cool beneath her soles and the air was sharp. She tiptoed across to the 
kitchen with food in mind, but her stomach replied that it was quite 
full enough. Her head reeled slightly when the light in the refrigerator 
caught her off-guard and suddenly, a nice cool drink seemed like the 
most wonderful idea in the world.

&quot;Hangover,&quot; Mai grunted under her breath. &quot;I so should have known 
better. Stupid sake.&quot;

Then, suddenly, her dream came rushing back at her in vague, twisting 
images, rushing about her head like a whirlpool. Her knees faltered and 
her hand caught the counter as she toppled forwards, holding herself up 
just barely. Her head was spinning frantically for a moment before the 
room righted itself and everything drifted back to normal.

&quot;I should really cut back on the sake if I&#39;m having dreams like that.&quot;

With the brief relived tension of her dreams over and done with, that 
morning was one of much hilarity, and Mai took every opportunity she 
could find to say something sexually suggestive. She found, with some 
degree of satisfaction, that as the morning progressed Natsuki was 
becoming gradually less and less bothered by her bizarre sense of 
humour. The constant blushing tapered off to barely ever, and all she 
got back then derogatory grunts and the occasional smarmy remark.

Natsuki was off to work, whatever that was, within far too short a time. 
Most of the socialising that Mai had been carefully planning all week 
was thrown back in the garbage when Natsuki&#39;s phone started ringing 
urgently for her attention. She had said that Shizuru wanted her for 
something, something rather important, and had left post haste.

Mikoto still sat in her favourite chair, though, with her patented 
morning smile, slightly dopy but enthusiastic expression on her face as 
she gazed up at her would-be guardian busily carrying several plates 
across from the kitchen on a wooden serving tray. Her grin grew even 
wider when she saw what was for breakfast, but then it always did.

&quot;Mai&#39;s cooking is always the best!&quot; protested Mikoto when the redhead 
had offered to take her somewhere a little more interesting for dinner 
that evening, just out of sheer boredom, and that had been only the 
start of a large and rather strange argument.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Meanwhile, at the Tokyo 12th District Hospital, Fujino Shizuru was in 
her office, as usual, roving through sheet after sheet of papers that 
most not acquainted with the medical profession would never be able to 
decipher. Her notebook sat on the desk, open, scanning slowly through 
endless pages of documents and charts and the like.

&quot;So, what&#39;s wrong with her anyway?&quot; asked the navy blue haired young 
woman sitting neatly in the chair opposite her, one leg crossed over the 
other, her dark riding suit gleaming in the harsh artificial light in 
the room. Her helmet hung from a coat-hook near the door, along with her 
gloves.

The older woman gave her a cautious look that said she would rather not 
be jumping to conclusions and sighed. &quot;Well, at the moment, she&#39;s just 
extremely dehydrated. We&#39;re working on solving that right now.&quot;

&quot;It is summer you know. Couldn&#39;t she just be some dumb kid, wandered 
out, got lost, got heatstroke and collapsed or something?&quot;

Shizuru shook her head, very patiently. &quot;She&#39;s just like the other one. 
They&#39;re both so dehydrated, but it&#39;s more than that. Her hair looks 
half-toasted and her eyes are so red and sore. When she woke up, she was 
holding her hand over her face and avoiding the lights. And her 
skin...just feels so dry and rough, and she&#39;s sunburnt all over. It&#39;s 
like she&#39;s been through a desert.&quot;

Natsuki blinked. &quot;So she&#39;s a foreigner?&quot;

The older woman shrugged slowly and turned to her computer again. &quot;She&#39;s 
also running a high temperature. Her core temperature is well above 
normal. She should be suffering from hyperthermia by now but she shows 
no signs of internal damage, besides her being a little singed on the 
outside.&quot;

&quot;Well, as suspicious as that is, we can&#39;t really make any assumptions 
until we have a little more substantial evidence, don&#39;t you agree?&quot;

&quot;Like her blood exams, you mean?&quot; Shizuru slid a thin file across the 
desk and looked up at her companion with a very serious expression. 
&quot;There&#39;s something profoundly not right about her blood in particular.&quot;

Natsuki took the file, a little apprehensively, and peered inside. &quot;What 
about it?&quot; she asked, peeling out several sheets of paper and skimming 
over them.

&quot;It&#39;s full of very strange things. Like trace metals. Some of them 
alloys nobody has even seen before, too. And gas pockets, of all 
things.&quot;

&quot;Bubbles?&quot; Natsuki looked as bemused as she sounded. &quot;In her blood?&quot;

&quot;Pockets,&quot; Shizuru reaffirmed, holding up one cautioning finger. &quot;Things 
like Helium and Nitrogen bubbles, but stuck inside little capsules of 
something we can&#39;t identify. Whatever it is it&#39;s so thin we&#39;re having 
trouble seeing it properly.&quot;

&quot;Why is your job never ordinary?&quot;

Shizuru smiled. &quot;You&#39;d be bored if it were, though. Admit it.&quot;

&quot;You said she woke up earlier. What happened then?&quot;

&quot;She was unintelligible. She speaks Japanese but it&#39;s no accent I&#39;ve 
ever heard before. All I could make out was that she was yelling for her 
father...&quot;

&quot;And you have no idea who that is, of course.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve asked the local Police to check their missing persons&#39; records 
for her, and if that doesn&#39;t work they&#39;ve promised to take it to the 
national registry office. She might be a foreigner after all unless we 
can find her in the citizen lists.&quot;

&quot;And what about the other one?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s in the same condition, though she seems much weaker at the 
moment. She&#39;s been unconscious since we took her in, only woke up once. 
She has the same accent, or very close, though she was a little weak so 
it&#39;s hard to be sure.&quot;

&quot;What did she say?&quot;

&quot;Just &quot;Nina.&quot;&quot;

Natsuki frowned. &quot;What&#39;s Nina? Or who...&quot;

There was a long, uncomfortable pause before Shizuru finally set her 
half-empty coffee cup down on the table, effectively breaking the 
silence with a sharp clatter. Natsuki flinched only very slightly.

&quot;So you&#39;re going again already, then?&quot; Shizuru sighed. &quot;Am I really that 
much of a bore?&quot;

&quot;This has nothing to do with that,&quot; the dark-haired woman replied, 
failing to meet her gaze. &quot;I&#39;m caught up in something and I don&#39;t have 
time for distractions.&quot;

&quot;A distraction, am I?&quot; Shizuru stood, without warning, and moved round 
to stand by Natsuki&#39;s side instead, leaning in against the younger woman 
until her lips were almost touching that thick, dark blue hair. &quot;Perhaps 
I need to try a little harder to distract you, hm?&quot;

Natsuki pushed her away and moved towards the door, not looking back 
over her shoulder as she often did. &quot;Don&#39;t talk like that now,&quot; she 
almost hissed. &quot;This...this isn&#39;t the time...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re attracted to her.&quot;

For a while, Natsuki didn&#39;t answer, her shoulders tense. Shizuru 
shrugged in defeat and shook her head, a rueful half-smile drifting 
across her lips. &quot;I can&#39;t blame you,&quot; she teased. &quot;Tokiha&#39;s a 
wonderfully...well-built young girl, after all.&quot;

Natsuki tossed her hair as she turned and flashed the older woman an 
agitated look. &quot;You&#39;ll let me know when Fuuka call up again, won&#39;t you?&quot; 
With that, she turned away again...

Shizuru reached out for her but she slipped through the doorway, and was 
gone.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Time passed in Tokyo as it did everywhere else, and soon it was drifting 
from afternoon into early evening. The sun was sinking gradually lower 
in the sky and clouds were gathering on the far edge of the city like an 
impending wave, ready to roll in at moment&#39;s notice once the sun had 
finally turned its back.

Somewhere in a small bar in a none-too-desirable area of the city, the 
lighting was as bad as ever. The floor was still unwashed, the ceiling 
was still peeling, and there were still no customers. The bartender 
didn&#39;t seem to care either, as usual, and simply carried on cleaning 
glasses as he always did and leaning against the taps.

Suddenly, a sharp beeping noise broke the silence.

The bartender fished around frantically in his pockets for a moment and 
produced a small black oblong device not even as large as the palm of 
his own hand. He pressed a button with one thumb and held the thing up 
to his head.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;The scenario is underway,&quot; said an unidentifiable male voice. There was 
a blip and the line was dead.

The bartender sighed and slapped the device down on the bar-top with a 
heavy sigh. &quot;Calling to let me know what I&#39;m missing or something, eh? 
Asshole.&quot;

&quot;Shut your whining, Shinji,&quot; said a harsh female voice from somewhere in 
the shadows behind the booths. &quot;You&#39;ll be working soon enough, don&#39;t 
worry. Though I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re looking forward to it, of all 
things.&quot;

&quot;Like you&#39;re not?&quot;

The shadowed lady in the corner grinned a most sinister grin.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

It was raining. Thin, light rain, but in such vast quantities that it 
utterly drenched everything.

Natsuki growled. &quot;Fucking fire alarm.&quot; She practically dove through the 
open office doorway and blasted hell out of an innocent water cooler 
that just happened to be right next to the Orphan she was hunting. In an 
office building, of all places.

The creature evaded yet again, throwing out a deadly swarm of 
multi-coloured energy shards behind it as it fled. Natsuki barely had 
time to throw herself behind a wall to avoid being skewered in several 
unpleasant ways at once. The concrete surface flayed apart under the 
sudden onslaught like paper under a sand-blaster, but the wall held 
relatively firm all the same, providing temporary protection at least. 
When the noise finally died down out she leapt once more with her 
trigger fingers twitching spastically, sending blinding blue shots 
peppering across the floor and up the far wall as she tracked upwards 
after the silhouette of that elusive beast.

Up it dove like a bird taking flight, straight through the flimsy 
plaster ceiling, a swirling cloud of white dust and debris churning up 
behind it to cover its escape. Natsuki was already rolling back to her 
feet towards the emergency stairwell, heart pounding in her chest, 
knuckles white as she squeezed tight around her twin weapons.

She was on the roof in no time at all, dark night sweeping in past the 
artificial light that enveloped the rest of the building. That dark 
inhuman figure was already loping steadily away from the hole it had 
punched up through the roof and heading towards the edge, its broad 
bat-like arms flapping like wings. Again she fired, and missed. 
Troubling indeed, the thing seemed to have some sort of repulsive 
barrier that sent an otherwise well-aimed shot off course. She snapped 
away one pistol and a small black orb appeared in its place in her hand 
that, when thrown, yielded similarly unimpressive results, though it did 
blow a neat circular hole into the ledge around the roof edge.

The thing leapt upward again, this time into open air, spreading its 
arms out wide. Natsuki ran to the edge to watch as it escaped, drifting 
lazily across to a nearby tower building and relative safety.

She cursed, loudly.

Then a screaming noise came rushing over her and a cluster of metallic 
shards rained down upon the concrete all around, forcing her back away 
from the ledge. The Orphan let off another cloud of thin green smoke, 
and from the swirling mass hurtled upward more of those thick, 
razor-sharp chunks, arcing up high and then dropping down on the distant 
office building. Natsuki was forced into a dodging frenzy, evading 
countless volleys of shards with little or no cover in sight, and no 
pause for her to return fire.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

High above the city, safely beyond visual range from the ground, though 
not so far as to infringe on Tokyo International&#39;s airspace, something 
much smaller than a plane was flying casually about. At first glance, it 
may have looked like no more than a very large bird, orange and red and 
yellow plumage like a winged ball of fire.

Mai shifted her body weight over to one side and wheeled round in a wide 
sweeping turn, hair fluttering wildly in the wind. Her limbs 
outstretched to either side, her Element at her wrists projecting 
flaming wings around her arms to keep her in steady flight so far from 
the ground.

&quot;Can you see anything?&quot; she yelled over the wind noise.

Mikoto&#39;s legs squeezed a little tighter around her waist. Thankfully the 
girl was so skinny that she weighed practically nothing, though bony 
knees digging into Mai&#39;s hips was not exactly comfortable. &quot;I see 
smoke,&quot; replied the young girl, pointing with one arm over towards a 
tall tower building deep in the Tokyo business district. &quot;Green smoke.&quot;

&quot;Orphan,&quot; Mai affirmed. &quot;Hang on tight.&quot;

Mikoto folded herself up along the redhead&#39;s front and clung around 
Mai&#39;s neck with both arms as they angled down over towards the ground, 
banking hard. Mai craned her neck to one side and squinted hard in the 
direction that her diminutive young friend had indicated, but Mikoto&#39;s 
eyes were clearly much better than were her own.

&quot;Can you hit it from this distance?&quot;

Mikoto shook her head. &quot;Drop me behind.&quot;

&quot;From this height, you&#39;re crazy!&quot; Despite her obvious concern, the young 
girl was already climbing around Mai&#39;s mid-section to crouch atop the 
redhead&#39;s back like a cat ready to pounce.

&quot;It&#39;ll be fine. Just fly over it.&quot;

Mai sighed heavily and pushed herself faster towards the tower. &quot;I 
really hope you know what you&#39;re doing.&quot;

Mikoto pointed with one finger. &quot;Aim for the wire.&quot; Mai followed along 
her line of sight... The tower in question was another of those huge 
square parking towers that had been popping up so rampantly in Tokyo 
lately, taller even than the office buildings around it. From one corner 
of the roof up some several hundred metres ran an almost invisible steel 
cable, a tether for an advertising blimp that floated high above the 
city with all sorts of bright neon signs plastered across its surface.

Mai growled. &quot;You are crazy!&quot; Nevertheless, she steered off towards the 
bobbing silver hulk at best speed, Mikoto clinging tightly to her back. 
Before she knew it, the weight on her back was shifting again as Mikoto 
stood up.

&quot;Closer!&quot;

Mai dove and swooped in like a hawk underneath the giant balloon, so 
close that Mikoto felt her hair standing on end as if reaching up 
towards the thing, static jumping between her fingers. As the cable 
passed by with a whoosh, she turned and leapt out, limbs out in a 
freefall position.

The tip of her sword caught the cable first and yanked her violently in 
towards it. She barely had time to swing her feet round to the side, 
shifting her body into a spiralling course down around the cable, only 
her sword slicing through the steel to slow her descent in the 
slightest. It was more than a little tricky keeping track of her 
opponent while she was spinning round that cable, the ground rushing up 
towards her all the time. Her stomach was doing the most bizarre things 
and her whole body felt so light.

Before too long, her feet met the cable instead of air and started 
pedalling away furiously, trying not to burn out her skin on the rough 
steel surface as she fell at some ungodly speed. Her sword came up and 
back over her head in both hands, ready to strike. The roof of the tower 
was barely ten metres below when she pushed off the cable with all the 
power in those deceptively skinny thighs and shot forth like a lance, a 
feral howl escaping her lips.

The shadowed beast turned to face her as she descended like a bullet 
down atop it. Unfortunately, the first swipe of that unstoppable sword 
found some smoothly curved barrier that simply diverted the blade down 
to one side away from the creature. Tendrils of blackness rushed out at 
her.

Mikoto danced on them, almost contemptuously, smacking every one with a 
good hard kick from one foot or the other, her excessive momentum 
pummelling her feet into the Orphan instead of burying her headfirst in 
the underlying concrete. Her arms swung back over her head for another 
strike but no opening presented itself, and those countless limbs never 
once let up. Her small, agile body was losing ground, bouncing back 
further and further with each strike she deflected.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Natsuki peered up over the pitifully short ledge she had huddled behind 
and blinked, several times in fact.

The creature had stopped belching out those huge clouds of metal 
shrapnel and was now, apparently, busy thrashing some unidentified small 
object at close-range instead. Its back was to her, and its attention 
clearly elsewhere.

She looked up. Something small and distant and vaguely orange glowed in 
the sky high overhead. Natsuki grinned.

Then she snapped her fingers. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t do not to take advantage of such 
a kindly presented opportunity, would it?&quot; Her pistols disappeared in a 
flash and she grasped her fingers around a different weapon. At her 
command, the gun materialised in her hand with a sharp pop; all twelve 
inches of it, a long, cylindrical device much like any modern handgun, 
though distinctly different in certain ways, not the least of which the 
design. Natsuki levelled the thing towards that distant target and 
closed her eyes.

Her mind exploded into colour behind her eyelids, that despicable thing 
in the centre. The image slowly crawled forward as she focused harder, 
her fingers squeezing tight on the false metal in her hands. She 
concentrated until she could see that familiar faint red glow on its 
back.

Then she pulled the trigger, and held. The thing juddered in her hands 
but her aim stayed steady as it let out a long, low humming noise. Blue 
light whirled around the muzzle of the thing, growing brighter and 
stronger. When she finally let go, the whole thing bucked backwards in 
her hands with considerable force, and a shockingly blue bolt of energy 
leapt screaming from that wide barrel, streaking across the space 
between her and her distant enemy with frightening speed.

Mikoto had just enough time to see something glaringly blue hurtling 
towards her...and then time slowed down. Suddenly, it was as if someone 
had dumped the whole world in treacle, all except for her brain. She 
panicked for a moment or two, but her common sense quickly caught up and 
reminded her of the impending doom.

With a colossal effort, she turned on her toes and pushed with all her 
might against those frozen black tentacles, leaping up and away from the 
creature. Her body slipped through the invisible fluid resistance like a 
hot knife cutting through butter, in slow motion. It was definitely the 
strangest sensation.

She tucked her head down into a roll, shoulder hitting the concrete roof 
first with some considerable force...and then everything was running 
again, faster than normal it seemed. She was thrown into a somersault by 
an explosion barely metres behind her that singed the skin of her feet, 
but besides that nothing seemed damaged.

&quot;That...was strange.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mai looked rather concerned, as well she should. Natsuki was blushing 
furiously and averting her gaze. Mikoto didn&#39;t seem to care, 
almost-naked and lounging haphazardly back against the metal railing 
with her sword resting beside her, her &quot;most important parts&quot; covered 
just barely by a flimsy little piece of white cloth Mai had bought 
somewhere nearby not minutes ago. Needless to say, she had flat out 
refused to wear the bra, for various reasons.

&quot;Just put it back on already!&quot; Mai snapped at her, again.

&quot;No,&quot; insisted Mikoto, in a tone that suggested that that was all the 
argument she needed. It was beginning to look that way, too.

Natsuki fumed, mostly to herself. &quot;This is ridiculous. She&#39;s just a 
child. You really shouldn&#39;t be getting so worked up over it.&quot;

&quot;Oh, then you can dress her!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what I...&quot; She trailed off.

Mai pointed at her accusingly, grinning yet again. &quot;Pervert!&quot;

&quot;Shut up, damnit!&quot;

&quot;Not like you haven&#39;t seen other girls naked before, right? I mean...you 
do bathe, don&#39;t you?&quot;

Natsuki sniffed and turned her back on them both again. Mai just looked 
pleased with herself, as usual.

&quot;But besides that...what are we going to do about it?&quot;

&quot;Well, we could just stick a collar on her and take her home like 
this...&quot; Mikoto blinked confusedly and looked up at the redhead.

&quot;You&#39;re disgusting.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a joke! Kami, you&#39;re so uptight sometimes, Kuga.&quot;

&quot;And anyway, I was talking about the Orphan!&quot;

Mai paused. &quot;Oh...right. That hole.&quot; She looked across the roof to where 
a large part of the concrete had been seemingly evaporated into thin 
air, leaving a wide circular gap where the Orphan had once stood. &quot;Just 
what the heck did you do to it anyway?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s dead. That&#39;s all that matters.&quot; Natsuki turned, arms crossed 
angrily over her chest, pouting as usual. &quot;That and getting out of here 
before the police come and arrest us for property destruction. And 
public indecency!&quot; she finished off, stabbing a finger accusatorily at 
the not-dressed teenage girl lounging nonchalantly nearby.

Mai looked beside her at the half-nude young girl and sighed. &quot;I think 
she looks nice, myself. Those really suit her, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

&quot;Your fashion sense is going to get us all into trouble, Tokiha.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just trying to think positively, unlike some people.&quot; Lilac eyes 
drifted slowly up and down Natsuki&#39;s body.

&quot;What...what is it?&quot; she stammered, blushing again. &quot;Stop looking at me 
like that.&quot;

&quot;Oh, relax, I already told you I don&#39;t swing that way.&quot; Mai shook her 
head slowly. &quot;But you&#39;re roughly the same size, you two...&quot;

Natsuki grunted and turned her head. &quot;Couldn&#39;t she just wear your 
clothes instead?&quot;

Mai grinned impishly. &quot;Want me to walk home in my underwear, huh? 
Kinky.&quot;

Natsuki just blushed some more and crossed her arms. Then she fiddled 
with the zipper on her suit to make sure it was securely fastened, just 
in case, and that made her even more self-conscious, and so it went. Mai 
was grinning like the proverbial cat all the while, of course, which 
only compounded the problem.

&quot;Just wondering if she&#39;ll fit into that suit of yours.&quot;

&quot;Absolutely not!&quot;

Mai held up her hands in a gesture of surrender. &quot;Okay...never mind. I 
can just buy a beach towel from that store down the street and I&#39;ll take 
her home in that.&quot; She turned and walked towards the stairwell...

&quot;Wait,&quot; a hesitant voice behind her. She paused and turned on her heel, 
looking back with a curious expression. &quot;I have...some spare 
clothes...in my bike.&quot; Natsuki ground one boot into the concrete 
awkwardly as she spoke, pouting loudly as ever and staring off in some 
other direction. &quot;As long as I get them back...&quot;

Mai was about to say something when Natsuki looked down at her watch and 
frowned. &quot;I should go now, anyway. There&#39;s somewhere I have to be later 
tonight.&quot;

&quot;Fujino-san, eh?&quot; teased the redhead.

For once, it didn&#39;t work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yukino leaned back until her head touched the grass, and stared lazily 
up at the sky above. Her eyes stopped squinting with that darned screen 
out of sight at last. She felt all the muscles in her fingers tingling 
slightly from all the overworking they had done the past few hours, and 
wriggled them until the feeling of a cool breeze brushing her fingertips 
faded back in. For a moment, her eyelids were sliding shut under their 
own weight, unconsciousness threatening at the edge of her mind.

&quot;...and that stupid board of directors, I swear, they&#39;re trying to 
illuminate me.&quot; A familiar voice wrenched her out of her almost-sleep. 
She blinked it off with a quick yawn and then backtracked... &quot;Just the 
other day-&quot;

&quot;-Alienate, Haruka-chan,&quot; she corrected, patiently as ever.

Haruka crossed her arms over her bountiful chest and pouted. &quot;I know!&quot; 
Then the mustard-haired woman leaned over her &quot;personal assistant&quot; and 
gave her a gentle tap on the nose with one perfectly shaped fingertip. 
&quot;You know, I&#39;ve always wondered...just how you always know what I mean. 
How do you do it anyway?&quot;

Yukino levelled her most alluring stare up at her partner, which was 
more really badly disguised adoration in effect, and her smile widened a 
little. &quot;I know Haruka-chan better than you know yourself.&quot;

Haruka blushed. It was like having something small and adorable giving 
her &quot;the eye&quot; only Yukino had it down to an art form. &quot;Yukino...silly 
girl.&quot;

They lapsed back into empty silence for a while, or rather Yukino 
relaxed back on the grass some more, half-awake while Haruka very 
quietly ranted on to herself about this and that and whatever. Somehow, 
the mere sound of that agitated voice was more than enough to keep the 
brunette drifting somewhere wonderfully relaxing right between 
consciousness and sleep.

Suddenly, she sat up. One finger nudged her glasses back up her nose as 
she squinted at the screen in her lap, trying to focus. Checked the 
date...

&quot;What is it, Yukino? Did you forget something?&quot;

&quot;Your birthday!&quot; yelped the other girl. A look of shocked dismay swamped 
her face. &quot;How...how could I forget...Haruka-chan&#39;s birthday! Oh, but 
it&#39;s just been such a busy week! We had that stupid meeting with the 
governor, and all those negotiations deals, and the shareholders&#39; 
meeting...&quot;

An arm curled back around her shoulders and soon she found her head 
buried into her favourite pillow, only a thin cotton sheet keeping that 
sumptuous warmth from her cheeks. Her body started relaxing again all by 
itself and her arguments melted away.

&quot;My birthday isn&#39;t till the weekend, silly,&quot; Haruka purred as she 
stroked her fingers through the other woman&#39;s hair. &quot;You&#39;ve got plenty 
of time. And besides, that makes tomorrow our anniversary.&quot; She just 
couldn&#39;t keep from grinning hugely at the sight of a sparkling gold band 
wrapped around her middle finger, glinting as it peeked through fine 
auburn locks.

&quot;Our...anniversary...isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;So right now it&#39;s my turn, okay? You&#39;ll see, I&#39;ll get you back for what 
you did to me.&quot;

Memories of lavender perfume and lilies and green silk drifted through 
her mind, and Yukino sighed deeply. She put her arms around her wife&#39;s 
mid-section and nuzzled into that inviting cleavage a little more, 
shamelessly one might say, even though they were out in public. For 
once, she didn&#39;t seem to care.

&quot;I guess I could just enjoy it a little more for now...&quot; Before she 
could finish, the sound of Haruka&#39;s heartbeat all around and that 
melodic voice singing softly had lulled her to sleep.
