<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 38 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/etercity-ch37.html">Back to Part 37</a><pre>Minako Aino smiled at her assistant as the blonde
dressed in the business suit entered the outer office
of the head of Earth&#39;s diplomatic Corps. She checked
her watch as she asked her, &quot;Have they arrived yet?&quot;

Nuku Nuku looked up from her desk as the perky redhead
said, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am, they&#39;re trickling in now. You
should also know Alucard left a urgent message as
well.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Minako paused before entering her inner office.

&quot;The Devillady knows,&quot; Nuku Nuku said, looking a bit
mystified but passing on the message exactly as
ordered.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Minako blinked, frowning in thought. She ran a
hand through her blonde hair and asked, &quot;Did he
mention how she took that news?&quot;

&quot;Not well, apparently,&quot; Nuku Nuku said mildly.

&quot;Great,&quot; Minako sighed as she went inside.

The office within was simply set up, a desk, chairs
and a couch along with a few decorations. Shrugging
off her coat Minako hung it up the rack beside the
door, then strode in her skirt and tunic over to her
desk. With a sigh she sat down and looked over the
paperwork stacked there by Nuku Nuku, then quickly
went to work.

Minako was nearly half way through the stack when Nuku
Nuku&#39;s voice came over the speaker in her desk,
&quot;Ma&#39;am, it&#39;s nearly ten.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; with some relief Minako rose, hurrying out of
her office then down a side corridor. She reached a
meeting room and pushed open the door, nodding to the
guard who patiently waited outside.

The men and women chatting quietly looked up as Minako
entered then their leader smiled at her welcomingly as
Major Motoko Kusanagi saluted and reported, &quot;Ma&#39;am,
all present and accounted for.&quot;

Minako smiled back at her lover as she said, &quot;At
ease.&quot;

The group of women and single man in the room relaxed
a bit, but they still stood in semi formal attention.
Kei and Yuri stood close together, the red and black
haired women in simple bodysuits rather than their
infamous battle-bikinis. Attim M-Zak, the raven haired
bio-engineered warrior stood protectively close to her
psionic partner Kei, the smaller blonde looking so
delicate beside her. Alucard sat comfortably, the tall
black haired vampire drinking something red from a
wine glasws, his eyes concealed by shades. Finally,
the part demon Katsumi Liqueur and her cyborg partner
Kiddy Phenil talked together quietly.

Minako smiled faintly as she studied the group. People
had often questioned that the majority of her field
agents were women, but in her experience they had a
better handle on their emotions, were better at
decision making and in a pinch could use the often
overlooked feminine wiles to get their way.

&quot;Thank you all for coming,&quot; Minako said warmly, &quot;I
know that in some cases it wasn&#39;t easy for you to get
away.&quot;

&quot;Tall me about it,&quot; Attim said wryly, the black haired
woman looking model gorgeous in a little red dress.

&quot;Still persuing the counterfit Emblem Seed trade?&quot;
Yuri asked, the black haired woman looking at her
curiously.

Attim nodded bleakly, &quot;People buy the artifacts hoping
for some kind of evolutionary leap, but all they get
is a painful death.&quot;

&#145;Unlike Kei,&#39; Minako noted. Exposed to a true alien
Emblem Seed Kei had been transformed into a nearly
immortal psionic of great power. Attim had been
partnered with her early on, and eventually Kei
managed to grant her partner some of her own
incredible physical regeneration ability.

&quot;Monster hunting is so much more rewarding in the
short term,&quot; Alucard smirked, his hat pulled low over
his face.

&quot;True enough,&quot; Katsumi admitted, her blue black hair
gleaming.

Kiddy gave Alucard a speculative look, &quot;I almost wish
we could get permission to go after you, Fangs.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d enjoy you trying,&quot; Alucard smirked.

&quot;Down, you two,&quot; Kei chuckled, the redhead looking
amused.

&quot;So,&quot; Motoko gave her boss a straight line, &quot;you
wanted to see us?&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Minako smiled. Looking at her best agents
she said, &quot;We have several issues on our plates, so
let&#39;s get started.&quot;

The briefing took nearly an hour, but it could be
summarized in several points. Firstly, was the ongoing
concern with weapon&#39;s smuggling into the border
worlds. Second was Earth&#39;s Isolationism movement and
their more radical members. Third was the covert
activities of allied governments in Earth controlled
territory. And last but not least, a request to keep
their eyes open for information on a new mysterious
Sailor Senshi.

&quot;Artist conception?&quot; Kei looked at the drawing of the
black and red garbed woman innocently, &quot;Why no photo?&quot;

&quot;Magical blocking,&quot; Attim explained to her partner,
&quot;unless a Senshi wants to get their photo taken, it
won&#39;t work.&quot;

&quot;A useful gift,&quot; Alucard admitted.

&quot;We&#39;ve got some contacts in the spacer guilds,&quot; Kei
looked thoughtful, &quot;we can see if anyone&#39;s heard
anything.&quot;

&quot;You all have your sources,&quot; Motoko acjnowledged, &quot;and
any information you can acquire would be appreciated.&quot;

&quot;Now,&quot; Minako said briskly, &quot;you all have the rest of
the day off, so mingle, compare notes and whatever
else you decide.&quot; A pause, &quot;Motoko, Alucard, you&#39;re
with me.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Motoko said as she and Alucard followed
their boss down the hall.

Once they entered the inner office Minako sat down
with a tired sigh. &quot;Okay,&quot; she asked, &quot;how did Jun
find out about your connection to me?&quot;

&quot;I underestimated her,&quot; Alucard conceded reluctantly.
&quot;I suspect she tailed me back to our meeting place,&quot;
he said.

Motoko looked disturbed, &quot;She avoided your enhanced
senses?&quot;

&quot;She stayed out of my range,&quot; Alucard sounded
disgusted, &quot;she flew several miles above me, at
least.&quot; He actually sighed, &quot;And I really wasn&#39;t
looking as hard as I should have.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not happy,&quot; Minako said after a moment, &quot;but I
don&#39;t blame you. Jun isn&#39;t a enemy, even though she
does have a temper.&quot;

&quot;She may not be a enemy but she isn&#39;t exactly a friend
to us either, Mina,&quot; Motoko reminded her. A wry smile,
&quot;She hates the Senshi&#39;s guts.&quot;

Minako thought about things a moment. &quot;How angry was
she?&quot; she asked.

&quot;A witness reports that she demolished her suite, as
well as frightening off investigating staff,&quot; Alucard
noted.

&quot;Really pissed,&quot; Minako noted glumly.

Motoko paced restlessly, her thoughts racing. &quot;I&quot;d
like t keep her, she&#39;s a damn powerful agent,&quot; she
noted, &quot;should I go see her?&quot;

&quot;And tell her what?&quot; Alucard said mockingly, &quot;you&#39;re
really not in the employ of Sailor Venus, despite what
it looks like?&quot;

&quot;Alucard,&quot; Motoko growled, &quot;you&#39;re not helping.&quot;

&quot;Deeply sorry,&quot; Alucard said, not at all sounding
repentant.

Minako cleared her throat, &quot;Not telling her the whole
truth is what got us into this mess, I think.&quot; A
smile, &quot;I&#39;ll go see her myself.&quot;

&quot;Not without a bodyguard,&quot; both Alucard and Motoko
said at nearly the same time.

&quot;I&#39;m not THAT crazy,&quot; Minako acknowledged.

To be continued...
