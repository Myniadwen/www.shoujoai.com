&quot;SHAMPOO my love!&quot; Mousse cried as he glomped Genma. &quot;Shampoo, have you 
put on weight, my love? It&#39;s okay with me, you know, that just means 
there&#39;s more of you to cuddle. You must have been training really hard 
though because you could really use a bath.&quot;

Several snickers were heard around the table as Genma&#39;s eye twitched.

&quot;Stupid Mousse, Shampoo over here,&quot; Shampoo said in exasperation. &quot;Put 
glasses on, fool.&quot;

Mousse slipped his glasses over his eyes and looked at who he was 
glomping.

&quot;GAH!&quot; the blind Amazon shrieked and leaped into the corner. He began 
rocking back and forth, chanting over and over, &quot;never be clean again, 
never be clean again.&quot;

&quot;What stupid duck want? Shampoo busy watching Airen in silly Vi-Dee-Oh 
world,&quot; Shampoo said.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Mousse asked adroitly.

Mousse was quickly brought up to speed on what happened to Ranma.

&quot;That FIEND,&quot; Mousse cried. &quot;He went there to stop that poor, devoted 
man from bringing the woman he loves back to life! How dare he 
interfere! Ranma Saotome, you are the enemy of love!&quot;

&quot;Riiiiight,&quot; Nabiki drawled, mistrustfully eyeing Shampoo&#39;s obviously 
insane stalker as everyone pulled their faces off the floor. &quot;Let&#39;s just 
watch the tapes.&quot;

The gathered people sweat-dropped as they looked sidelong at Mousse and 
quickly nodded.

(oO\O/Oo)

It had been a long night the night before for both Ranma and Misato. 
They had spent several hours cleaning the place up. Misato hadn&#39;t been 
happy about it, but Ranma wouldn&#39;t let her have enough beer to get drunk 
until the job was done. Every time she tried to have more than one beer 
in an hour, the pigtailed boy would appear as if by magic and suddenly, 
Misato would have a glass of water in her hand. Once, he had replaced 
the can with an empty beer can filled with water and she nearly choked 
to death when it wasn&#39;t what she expected.

Ranma was still chuckling about that as he came in from his morning 
training session. The way she had been thrashing around on the floor 
clutching at her throat, one could have sworn he had fed her drain 
cleaner or something. After that he had relented and let Misato pound 
several beers while he went to the market to get groceries that didn&#39;t 
involve instant ramen, junk food, or booze.

Ranma entered the furo and began to bathe for the day. He shivered as he 
poured the cold water over his head and felt the change run through him. 
Washing quickly and efficiently, the redhead slipped into the furo.

After a short soak, Ranma got dressed and headed into the kitchen to 
prepare breakfast. He was just setting the table when Misato came out 
looking like the living dead. Ranma looked her over as she stood in the 
doorway scratching under her breasts and yawning.

&#39;She&#39;s definitely cute, even looking like a zombie,&#39; Ranma admitted to 
himself. &quot;Good morning, Misato,&quot; Ranma chirped cheerfully, just because 
he knew it would annoy her.

Misato gave him the evil eye and grunted something that probably wasn&#39;t 
very lady-like if it had been intelligible. Ranma chuckled at her and 
handed her a beer before guiding her to the table. As soon as she sat 
down, she cracked open the beer and slammed the whole can in one long 
gulp.

&quot;YEEEE HAAAW!&quot; she yelled as she slammed the empty can down on the 
table. &quot;That&#39;s the stuff!&quot;

Ranma just grinned and shook his head.

&quot;So what&#39;s the plan for today, Misato?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Well, you don&#39;t start school for another few weeks,&quot; the purple-haired 
captain said as she ate. &quot;Hey, this is pretty good, Ranma. Anyway, 
Ritsuko wants you back at NERV for a Sync Test and to begin your Eva 
training. After that, she&#39;s probably going to want to poke and prod that 
hot young body of yours.&quot;

&quot;Greaaat,&quot; Ranma drawled unenthusiastically.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma stood in her own personal locker room. Given her condition they 
felt it was best for her to have a changing room and shower all to 
herself. Ranma didn&#39;t mind that a bit. While she knew she could thrash 
any guy that got fresh with her, that didn&#39;t mean she wanted them ogling 
her if she happened to be in this form. Likewise, she didn&#39;t want the 
pain that would invariably come if they made her use the women&#39;s locker 
room.

Dr. Akagi wanted to get some data on her girl form today since they 
already had some on her male form. Ranma got undressed and pulled on the 
plug suit they had given her. Once she had it on and in place, she hit 
the control on her wrist causing the suit to conform to every curve of 
her body. The plug suit for this body was mostly blue with black trim, 
while the one for her male form was blue and white.

Ranma looked in the mirror and froze. Dai and Hiroshi always said she 
looked just like Asuka Langley Sohryu from this series, but Ranma had 
never really believed it. Now standing here in a plug suit, looking at 
herself in the mirror, it was pretty obvious. Ranma&#39;s hair was a couple 
shades brighter red and it was in a different style, but the resemblance 
was undeniable.

&#39;Wonder what Asuka is going to make of having a twin?&#39; Ranma thought to 
herself as she tested her range of motion in the tight-fitting suit.

Ranma performed a slow handstand before doing a split and holding 
herself up on the tip of one finger. She came out of the position and 
into a backwards walkover, displaying uncanny coordination and 
flexibility. The suit resisted her movements slightly but didn&#39;t 
actually restrict her at all. Satisfied, she headed out to find Dr. 
Akagi.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma sat in the entry plug thinking. There wasn&#39;t much else to do 
during the Sync Test. Searching her memory, she was dredging up every 
scrap of information she could recall about all the main players in NGE. 
She had to find a way to make inroads to those that could help her stop 
the coming apocalypse that Gendo Ikari and the mysterious organization 
SEELE was going to bring down on their heads.

Ritsuko Akagi would be a big help since she was definitely in the know 
as far as some of the darker projects went. She wasn&#39;t privy to Gendo&#39;s 
ultimate plan though. He was using her, keeping her loyal by leading her 
on and sleeping with her. In the end, he would cast her to the wolves 
like yesterday&#39;s garbage. The problem was, Ranma couldn&#39;t think of a way 
to convince her of this before it was too late to be of use. If she let 
on she knew too much, Dr. Akagi would certainly inform Gendo.

Misato Katsuragi wouldn&#39;t be much help either. She was little more than 
a figurehead; an altruistic poster child dedicated to NERV&#39;s public 
purpose. She was there to cover NERV&#39;s darker machinations and they 
wouldn&#39;t hesitate to eliminate her if they thought she knew something 
she shouldn&#39;t. The best Misato could hope for was to blow the whistle, 
but that would just send the conspirators into hiding, or worse, force 
their hand.

Kaji Ryoji might be of some use. He certainly knew more than he let on, 
but it was hard to tell where his loyalties lay. He was a double agent 
and he ultimately turned against SEELE. If Ranma could figure him out, 
to gain his loyalty, then Kaji would be very useful in taking down the 
whole pit of vipers. He could also be unintentionally useful for one 
other purpose Ranma had in mind.

Rei Ayanami was integral to Gendo&#39;s plan. If Ranma could turn her and 
then keep her alive, that would be a big help. Rei, as Ranma recalled, 
was cold and distant from everyone but Gendo. She was raised to be 
incapable of emotions and conditioned to follow orders to the letter. 
But the fact was, she felt more than she let on. From what Ranma had 
seen, Shinji had made a connection with her. She sacrificed her life for 
his. Ranma decided that she would have to draw her out, get her to 
confront the things she was feeling sooner than Shinji did. Besides, 
Ranma felt a sort of kinship with the repressed girl. They had a lot of 
parallels in their lives.

Asuka Langley Sohryu was another one she was going to have to work on. 
Ever since she had seen herself in the mirror, it had come home to her 
that what Dai and Hiroshi were saying about her being just like Ranma 
had really come home to roost. Aside from the fact that she was 
interested in Kaji and wore dresses, Ranma had to admit that their 
attitudes were eerily similar. The girl was driven to be the best, to 
prove to herself and others that she had some degree of worth.

Her breakdown, after a string of failures, paralleled Ranma&#39;s own when 
Happosai had used the Ultimate Weakness Moxibustion on her. If Cologne 
hadn&#39;t offered her some hope when she did, Ranma didn&#39;t like to think 
what she may have done. Unfortunately for Asuka, by the time she lost 
hope, everyone else was too far gone to offer her any.

Ranma concluded that Asuka desperately needed a friend who wouldn&#39;t 
allow her to push them away. However, she also knew that she would be 
behind the eight-ball with the German girl from the start with her Sync 
Ratio being significantly higher. Asuka would be extremely jealous of 
that fact.

The best approach, Ranma decided, would be to be her friend, not put up 
with her abusive attitude, and offer to train her to be better. Not 
taking her abuse would be difficult while still remaining her friend. It 
meant Ranma would have to fight back, but not in such a way that it 
would completely alienate her.

Thinking of training, Ranma suddenly had a flare of inspiration. That 
could be the key to connecting with Rei as well. The excuse would be to 
improve her skills as a pilot, but in order to reach the state where she 
would be able to use Ranma&#39;s Sync boosting technique, she would have to 
confront her emotions and be aware of them.

The others, Ranma would have to work on slowly and carefully. She would 
plant the seeds of doubt in their minds and cultivate them, hopefully 
they would bear fruit before it was too late. Rei, she could start on 
almost immediately.

&quot;That&#39;s excellent, Ranma,&quot; Dr. Akagi said over the comm. &quot;Your Sync 
Ratio is steady at 64 percent. Try the technique you used the first 
time.&quot;

&quot;You got it,&quot; Ranma replied and began the boosting techniques.

&quot;Fascinating,&quot; Dr. Akagi said, the wonder clear in her voice. &quot;Your Sync 
Ratio just jumped to 87 percent. That&#39;s incredible.&quot;

&quot;Just takes trainin&#39;,&quot; Ranma commented.

&quot;If you say so, Ranma,&quot; Dr. Akagi laughed lightly. &quot;Okay, we&#39;re done. 
When you get out, go change forms and we&#39;ll test your male side and see 
if there&#39;s any variance.&quot;

&quot;Roger,&quot; Ranma acknowledged.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma had only dropped a couple of points between his male side and 
female side, which was within the tolerance of the equipment so it was 
deemed negligible. Currently, he was in the holochamber for his second 
week of gunnery practice.

As he practiced, something was bugging him. He was trying to pin down 
what it was as he moved around the chamber shooting at the targets that 
popped up. As he laid waste to three targets in rapid succession, it hit 
him. There was only one incident he could recall where the guns the 
Eva&#39;s had available were actually effective.

He had to talk to Dr. Akagi about this to explore some other 
alternatives, but unfortunately he had to do so in such a way as to not 
alert her to his foreknowledge. He spent the rest of the practice 
session trying to think of a way to do it.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Dr. Akagi?&quot; Ritsuko looked up to see the pigtailed boy enter her 
office.

Ranma was still in his plug suit which was causing quite a distraction 
with the female population of NERV. Ritsuko grinned, remembering the 
female techs all crowded around a monitor watching Ranma. He was 
definitely a little heart breaker.

&quot;Yes? What can I do for you, Ranma?&quot; Ritsuko asked, gesturing for him to 
take a seat.

&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking, our guns for the Evas, they are basically just 
conventional artillery adapted into Eva-sized small arms, aren&#39;t they?&quot; 
Ranma asked pensively.

Ritsuko blinked.

&quot;Yes, I suppose that&#39;s true,&quot; she allowed. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s just that all the conventional artillery that was thrown at 
the last angel didn&#39;t even scratch it,&quot; Ranma posed. &quot;Since our guns are 
adapted from that artillery, it seems like to me that the only really 
effective weapon we have is the prog knife and my hand-to-hand skill.&quot;

Ritsuko gaped at the pigtailed pilot. She suddenly had a sinking feeling 
that he was right.

&quot;I...see,&quot; Ritsuko said hesitantly. &quot;So what are you suggesting?&quot;

&quot;Well, I do have some ideas,&quot; Ranma grinned and rubbed his hands 
together. &quot;I was thinking that since the prog knife is effective, at 
least it was on the angel I fought, we could expand on that and come up 
with a progressive katana, or a progressive naginata or something. The 
pole arm would give us a little more range, but the sword would be 
better for fighting in the streets. Do you think we could get some 
things like that?&quot;

&quot;Ranma, for someone with as little education as you have, you amaze me,&quot; 
Ritsuko said in surprise.

&quot;I know fighting, Dr. Akagi,&quot; Ranma shrugged. &quot;I may not know much else, 
but I do know fighting and it&#39;s what I&#39;m best at.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t doubt it,&quot; Ritsuko said, giving him a grin. &quot;I&#39;ll pass your 
idea along to R&amp;D with my recommendation. It shouldn&#39;t be hard to come 
up with something that fits the bill. Now why don&#39;t you get changed and 
I&#39;ll give you some more computer lessons.&quot;

Ranma groaned and rolled his eyes but did as he was told.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma sat quietly in the car that night as he caught a ride with Misato. 
He was thinking about his last words with Dr. Akagi, hoping that he 
didn&#39;t push her too hard.

&quot;Be careful around my Pop, Dr. Akagi,&quot; Ranma had told her.

&quot;Why?&quot; She had asked with that amused little grin she had.

&quot;Because he&#39;s a manipulative bastard with a god complex that gets off on 
toying with people&#39;s feelings and loyalties,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;He may 
appear to be helping save the world, but the old fart doesn&#39;t have an 
altruistic bone in his body. He&#39;s up to something, whether it&#39;s setting 
himself up to take over the world with an army of mindlessly loyal 
Eva&#39;s, or something worse, I know it in my gut. When the shit hits the 
fan, it&#39;ll be the people closest to him that get thrown to the wolves. 
You seem like a real nice person, Doc, and I would hate to see that 
happen to you.&quot;

Hopefully the hints were close enough to home that it would make the 
blonde woman think with more than her libido and not make her too 
suspicious of just what Ranma knew exactly.

&quot;Whatcha thinkin&#39; about, Ranma?&quot; Misato asked.

Ranma looked over at her and smiled.

&quot;Oh, just wondering if you would teach me how to drive,&quot; Ranma said 
casually.

Misato grinned like a maniac, which happened to match her driving to a 
tee.

&quot;You really want me to teach you how to drive?&quot; Misato asked hopefully.

&quot;Hell yeah,&quot; Ranma smirked. &quot;You&#39;re the best driver I&#39;ve ridden with.&quot;

She was the only driver he&#39;d ridden with but she didn&#39;t have to know 
that. Besides, her driving style seemed to have an aggressive flair that 
other drivers seemed to lack. Ranma thought it suited his own style 
nicely, always pushing the envelope. Riding with Misato was fun. He 
really didn&#39;t understand why people paled and ran screaming when faced 
with the prospect of being in the car with her driving.

&quot;I dunno, Ranma. You&#39;re only fourteen after all,&quot; Misato hedged.

&quot;Misato, I drive a 200 foot mecha around fighting angels, I think I can 
probably be trusted with a 2000 pound car,&quot; Ranma argued.

&quot;What&#39;s it worth to ya?&quot; Misato asked.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Driving lessons. What are they worth to you? If I agree, what do I get 
out of it?&quot; she smirked.

&quot;What do ya want?&quot; Ranma countered.

&quot;Laundry,&quot; Misato said.

&quot;Not a chance. No way I&#39;m washin&#39; your panties,&quot; Ranma declined. &quot;How 
about for every lesson with me behind the wheel, I take your turn 
vacuuming.&quot;

&quot;Dream on,&quot; Misato said laughed. &quot;Same deal, except you take my turn 
cleaning the bathroom.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t think so,&quot; Ranma shook his head. &quot;How about I do the dishes every 
night until the lessons are over?&quot;

He usually had to do dishes anyway since Misato was usually too drunk by 
that time to do a good job.

&quot;Deal,&quot; Misato grinned. &quot;We&#39;ll start this weekend.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Ranma agreed.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Class, we have a new student today,&quot; the homeroom teacher, Bendo 
Steinakawa said in a lethargic monotone. &quot;Would you please introduce 
yourself?&quot; the teacher said, putting several people to sleep in 12 words 
or less.

&quot;Yo!&quot; Ranma said loudly, jarring the sleeping students from their 
induced somnolence. &quot;My name is Ranma Ikari. I&#39;m a martial artist. I 
just came back from a ten year training trip that included traveling 
most of Asia. My dad is an evil bastard that plans to take over the 
world, but currently he&#39;s only gotten so far as running NERV. That&#39;s 
about all I got to say...oh wait, if you happen to see a petite healthy 
redhead running around, don&#39;t bother her; she&#39;s my sister. She ain&#39;t 
into guys and after she beats you down, I&#39;ll find you and take my turn, 
got it?&quot;

Ranma punctuated his statement by cracking his knuckles. As there was 
only one kid in the class that was bigger than him, and then not by 
much, the guys all flinched and nodded.

&quot;Great,&quot; Steinakawa-sensei said lethargically. &quot;If you could have a seat 
in any available desk Ikari-san, we&#39;ll get started on our lecture. Today 
we will be covering the Second Impact.&quot;

Three quarters of the class was asleep before he got half way through 
those three sentences. Ranma looked around the room and spotted Rei 
Ayanami right where he expected her to be. He moved to the desk behind 
her and sat down.

&quot;We gotta talk later, Ayanami-san,&quot; Ranma whispered to her.

The blue-haired girl nodded imperceptibly and continued to stare out the 
window. Ranma for his part never had a chance. Within five minutes of 
listening to the indolent teacher and his languid speech sucking the 
energy from the room, Ranma was comatose.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma woke up to someone poking his shoulder. He picked his head up to 
notice that it must have been the break between classes since everyone 
was up and walking around. Then he noticed the three girls clustered 
around his desk.

&quot;Excuse me, Ikari-san,&quot; the more outgoing of them said. &quot;We were 
wondering; are you the pilot of the giant robot?&quot;

Ranma blinked at them.

&quot;Well, are you?&quot; one of the other girls prompted.

Ranma sighed in resignation because he knew what was coming next.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ranma admitted, and as he expected he was instantly swamped with 
other students peppering him with questions.

There were only three students that didn&#39;t seem to care about asking him 
all sorts of inane questions about the Eva; Rei, Hikari the Class Rep, 
and the large guy that Ranma pegged as Toji. Ranma knew this was the guy 
that planned on trying to feed him a knuckle sandwich later. Ranma felt 
for the guy and his sister, but Ranma wasn&#39;t about to let Toji take his 
frustrations out on him.

Ranma was eventually saved from the inquisition by the next teacher 
coming in and calling the class to order.

(oO\O/Oo)

Once again, Ranma was awoken to someone tapping him on the shoulder. 
Ranma looked up to see Rei&#39;s heavily bandaged regard.

&quot;Pilot Ikari, it is lunch time,&quot; she said mechanically. &quot;This would be 
an acceptable time for you to speak with me.&quot;

&quot;Um, right,&quot; Ranma said, taking out his bento. &quot;I just wanted to get to 
know you a little better. I thought maybe since we have to work together 
that we could be friends.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;Why not?&quot; Ranma asked. &quot;Look, Rei, bein&#39; friends and getting to know 
each other will help us work together better.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;Okay, first, we will get an idea of each others strengths and 
weaknesses,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;And we will have an idea how the other 
might react to any situation so we can move to support each other faster 
in a fight by anticipatin&#39; how the other will react.&quot;

&quot;Being friends with you will make me a better pilot?&quot; Rei asked in a 
tone devoid of emotion.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Ranma nodded. &quot;If you want I could even train you in the art. 
My trainin&#39; helped me a lot when I fought that angel.&quot;

&quot;I reviewed the recording of your battle and you are an adequate pilot,&quot; 
Rei conceded, causing Ranma&#39;s eye to twitch at being called &#39;adequate&#39;. 
&quot;However, if having a friend was necessary to be a better pilot, then 
the Commander would have assigned me one.&quot;

Ranma put his face in his palm and shook his head.

&quot;Rei, Pop might know a lot of things but he doesn&#39;t know shit about 
being a warrior,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;All he knows is how to bully and use 
people.&quot;

&quot;He is a great man,&quot; Rei argued, her tone still not betraying a hint of 
emotion.

&quot;Don&#39;t make me laugh,&quot; Ranma snorted. &quot;He&#39;s a pathetic, self-centered, 
evil bastard. To call him a snake is an insult to snakes everywhere. You 
just don&#39;t know any better because he&#39;s kept you isolated from other 
people to keep you from seeing what he really is.&quot;

&quot;He is the Commander, he deserves respect,&quot; Rei countered.

&quot;Respect is earned, Rei,&quot; Ranma argued. &quot;Just because someone managed to 
lie and manipulate their way into a position of power don&#39;t make them 
worthy of respect.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Rei queried.

&quot;Because people who are worthy of respect, respect others and try to 
help them,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;Pop has no respect for anyone except as 
far as their abilities to help him or hinder him from gettin&#39; what he 
wants.&quot;

&quot;Commander Ikari wishes to help all people,&quot; Rei asserted.

&quot;Does he really, Rei?&quot; Ranma asked. &quot;Or does he want to use them to 
achieve his goals no matter what it may cost the people around him in 
the end?&quot;

Rei blinked at that. Ranma knew that she was, by necessity, privy to 
Gendo&#39;s ultimate plan, being a key part of it.

&quot;Anyway, that&#39;s all beside the point,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I wanna be your 
friend and help you become a better pilot. What&#39;d ya say?&quot;

&quot;Your offer does appear to have merit,&quot; Rei allowed. &quot;I shall have to 
consider it.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Ranma nodded. &quot;You let me know when you&#39;re ready to begin 
training.&quot;

&quot;Affirmative,&quot; Rei said, turning back to her own bento.

Smirking, Ranma quickly finished his bento and headed out of the 
classroom. He had an appointment with a certain angry jock.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Hey, New Kid!&quot; Ranma smirked as he heard the expected challenge and 
turned.

&quot;Me?&quot; Ranma asked innocently.

&quot;You see any other new kids around here?&quot; the large jock retorted.

&quot;Whatcha want?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Because of your joy ride in your little toy, my sister&#39;s in the 
hospital,&quot; Toji stated. &quot;Nothing personal, but it&#39;s my duty as her 
brother to kick your ass.&quot;

Ranma rolled his eyes as Toji cracked his knuckles.

&quot;&#39;Kay, take your best shot, Tough Guy,&quot; Ranma said, crossing his arms 
over his chest and waiting.

Toji shrugged and charged in with a haymaker he was certain would put 
the guy down. Ranma turned his head with the blow and having fought some 
of the most powerful people in his world, he barely felt Toji&#39;s 
untrained punch. Toji blinked as Ranma didn&#39;t even sway with the blow, 
just turned his head back to look at the larger boy.

&quot;That all ya got, Cupcake? &#39;Cause to be honest, I&#39;ve seen little old 
ladies that could hit harder than that,&quot; Ranma observed.

Both Toji and his friend blinked in disbelief, but the jock quickly 
recovered and growled, pulling his fist back for another punch. Ranma 
redirected the punch, snagging Toji&#39;s wrist and spinning him around. 
Toji found his right arm bent behind his head, his elbow sticking 
straight up, while Ranma hooked his free arm through Toji&#39;s left. 
Transferring his grip on Toji&#39;s wrist to the arm hooked through the 
larger boy&#39;s left arm, Ranma grabbed the jock around the throat, pulling 
him down and back, off balance with no leverage.

&quot;Listen up, Cupcake,&quot; Ranma said causally. &quot;I feel really bad about your 
sister, I really do. And I understand you&#39;re angry because you couldn&#39;t 
protect her. You gotta use your head for something more than a hat rack 
though. If I hadn&#39;t fought that angel, your sister, you, your buddy over 
there, everyone in this city, if not the world, would be dead, not just 
injured. I didn&#39;t choose where to fight that thing, it did. Be angry at 
the monster, not the guy that saved your sorry hide. Besides, you got 
about as much chance of hurting me as you do the stupid monster, so I 
guess you better find an easier target to take your frustrations out on, 
got it?&quot;

&quot;Pilot Ikari, another angel has been detected,&quot; Rei said, arriving on 
cue. &quot;We are to meet Captain Katsuragi in front of the school to be 
taken to headquarters.&quot;

As Rei took off, Ranma stood Toji up and released him.

&quot;Sorry, love to stay and chat, but I got a city to save,&quot; Ranma said, 
patting the larger boy on the shoulder. &quot;You guys better get to a 
shelter.&quot;

Toji and Kensuke gaped as Ranma leapt up, bouncing off a second story 
window ledge and then onto the roof of the school and disappearing from 
their sight.

&quot;It&#39;s probably not a good idea for you to pick any more fights with him, 
Toji,&quot; Kensuke opined.

Toji, still wide-eyed in awe, shook his head rapidly. One minute he was 
taking a swing at the guy and the next, he was locked up and powerless, 
at the guy&#39;s mercy and not even knowing how it happened. This Ranma 
Ikari was definitely not someone any sane person wanted to tangle with. 
Beside, he said he felt bad about Toji&#39;s sister and had given him a free 
shot, and maybe he was right about saving everyone, so far be it from 
Toji Suzuhara not to forgive and forget. Yup, he had meted out his 
retribution on the guy, so he could let it go. No need to beat on the 
guy any more.

&quot;L-let&#39;s get to the shelter,&quot; Toji said, grabbing Kensuke by his shirt 
and dragging him off as the sirens began to sound.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Ranma! Prepare to die!&quot; Ryoga yelled as he burst into the room causing 
Nabiki to roll her eyes and pause the tape.

&quot;You Jackass, Ranma-honey ain&#39;t here!&quot; Ukyo snapped.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Ryoga looked around, confused. &quot;But I just heard him.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s because some Jackass used a spell on him to trap him in these 
video tapes,&quot; Ukyo explained. &quot;We are watching what he&#39;s doing in that 
world.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Ryoga said intelligently.

&quot;Oh my, perhaps while somebody explains things, I&#39;ll go start dinner. We 
can watch the next episode afterward,&quot; Kasumi suggested.

&quot;Wonderful idea, Kasumi,&quot; Soun said.

&quot;Quite right, Tendo,&quot; Genma agreed, though he was still a bit miffed at 
the slanderous misinterpretations of his actions the show seemed overly 
fond of pointing out.

&quot;I&#39;ll give ya a hand, Kasumi,&quot; Ukyo offered, getting up and following 
the oldest Tendo sister into the kitchen.

While dinner was being prepared, Nabiki explained to Ryoga what had 
happened, for a suitable fee of course. Ryoga listened to the story with 
a growing sense of joy. Finally, someone had gotten that cowardly 
bastard Ranma out of the way! Now there was nothing standing between him 
and dear, sweet Akane!

&quot;So let me get this straight, Ranma was banished into this Neon Genesis 
Evangelion anime, where he is fighting these things called angels, but 
in the end, it&#39;s all for nothing because the world gets destroyed and 
everybody gets dissolved into goo anyway?&quot; Ryoga asked.

&quot;Well, we don&#39;t know for sure,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;That&#39;s how the original 
anime ended, but Ranma has already changed a few minor things, so he 
might be able to stop the apocalypse. This was his favorite anime so he 
knows what&#39;s supposed to happen. He just has to use that knowledge to 
stop things from happening that way. It&#39;s a long shot though. There&#39;s a 
lot of things stacked against him.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Ryoga said, beginning to chortle. &quot;So it&#39;s a big possibility 
that Ranma will die in the end? And nobody knows how to bring him back?&quot;

&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Nabiki admitted.

&quot;Oh happy day!&quot; Ryoga crowed and started laughing hysterically. 
&quot;Finally, someone has managed to rid the world of that honorless coward! 
This is such wonderful news...erk!&quot;

Ryoga&#39;s celebration was cut short by way of a bonbori and a battle 
spatula applied to his head repeatedly.

&quot;Pig-boy no talk about Airen like that,&quot; Shampoo said.

&quot;Yeah, Sugar, you got a lot of room to talk about being honorless,&quot; Ukyo 
added after she returned to the room with some dishes to set the table 
just as Ryoga began his squeals of joy.

Akane had refrained from malleting him due to the fact that she thought 
of him as a friend, however, she was giving him a speculative look. She 
had thought that deep down, Ryoga was Ranma&#39;s friend. After all he 
always tried to help Ranma find a cure for his curse, in spite of the 
fact that Ranma was always picking on him. However, Ryoga&#39;s outburst of 
joy at what had happened was definitely not the reaction of a friend.

Akane&#39;s look darkened as she began reviewing Ryoga&#39;s various encounters 
with Ranma in this new light.</pre>
