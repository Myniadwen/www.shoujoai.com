<h2>Foxfire Dreams </h2>
<p>Ying-Ying was awake when Konatsu’s eyes opened at first  light, and she watched as the sun played within their green depths.  The other girl noted the small look of  disappointment and sighed.</p><p>
  “Konatsu’s fine, Ying-Ying.  She’s still dreaming.” Clove said quietly.  “I think she’s enjoying having a soft bed too  much to want to leave it.”</p><p>
  The pink haired ghost smiled.  “Is she having sweet dreams?”</p><p>
  Clove sighed again.   “Of you and Zhu Shu and Ukyo and someone she sees as an angel of fire.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying’s eyes widened.  “She’s dreaming of Rei too?  That’s unexpected.”</p><p>
  Clove shrugged, then sat up.  “How’s that girl?”</p><p>
  “Lo Shen took her to the Bunny Hutch last night after  you fainted.”  Ying-Ying answered.  “And we had Doctor Tofu and Sailor Mercury  check her out.  She was exhausted after  whatever it was you did, but she seems fine.”</p><p>
  “I see.  That’s  good then.  That means I got all of it.”</p><p>
  “What was that thing?”</p><p>
  “A little toy of Xi’an Chi’s.  A Chaos Crystal.  At least that is what he called it when he  stuck one in me right before killing me.”   Clove’s head hung down, throwing her eyes into shadow.  “It gave him complete control of over  me.  I couldn’t even think for myself  fully.  I knew he was controlling me, but  it seemed like I was doing things by my own choice.  He made me torture <em>myself</em> as much as he did before he drowned me.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying’s voice was full of sympathy.  “I’m sorry you suffered so much, Clove.”</p><p>
  Clove sighed.   “I still have trouble understanding how you can even find yourself <em>not</em> hating me.  I’m sitting here, possessing your soulmate,  and you’ve just accepted it.  How can you  feel <em>sorry</em> for me?”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying put a hand on Clove’s.  “You may be inside Konatsu, Clove, but you  haven’t hurt her, and you brought her to us much sooner than she would have  come otherwise.  I was not expecting her  to find us until after Zhu Shu and Ukyo had returned.  And while you may have done so for misguided  reasons, I cannot but find happiness in the fact that you have not only given  my love a great gift, but brought her great joy as well by giving her that  gift.”</p><p>
  “I used my own blood mixed with the water from the  Nannichuan to make her body a match for my own, and create enough similarity  between us to enable me to merge with her!   How is that a ‘gift’, Ying-Ying?   I had planned to use her to not only make Zhu Shu love me, but had  planned to enamor Zhu Shu so completely that she would have betrayed her other  soulmates just to be with me!  All so I  could hurt her as badly as I was hurt before I killed her in revenge!”  Clove shook as tears ran down from her  eyes.  “I’m a monster every bit as  horrible as Xi’an Chi!”</p><p>
  “Did you actually do any of those terrible things,  Clove?”</p><p>
  “I would have if Konatsu’s soul hadn’t been so  terribly, desperately in need of love!”   Clove sobbed.  “Don’t you <em>understand?</em>  I’ve killed people, used them, tossed them  aside when I was done with them.  I’ve  hurt too many people, Ying-Ying.  I never  cared if the girl I wanted was in love with someone else, I just charmed them  into loving me, into betraying the people they loved, all so I could pretend to  feel like they loved <em>me</em>.  And it was all so <em>hollow</em>!  I’ve done such  terrible things for love and I never even understood what it really was!”  She curled up into a ball as she hugged her  knees.  “Not until Konatsu’s soul-link  with you showed me.”</p><p>
  “Then I am happy my beloved could give to you  something in return for your gift to her.   And you have done none of those things in <em>this</em> life, Clove.”</p><p>
  “I don’t deserve your forgiveness, Ying-Ying.”</p><p>
  “But you have it anyway.  I am a spirit healer, Clove.  I want to help you as much as I can.  I want to help you find your path to  happiness, and to keep you safe until you can find it.”</p><p>
  “Even though I have taken over your lover’s body?”</p><p>
  “But you haven’t Clove.  You may share it, but you’ve done nothing to  harm her in any way.  I felt you release  her the other night.  You made the choice  not to hurt her when I wouldn’t have even known it would have been a trauma for  her.  You kept <em>me</em> from hurting her by doing it.”</p><p>
  “I - I don’t know if I would be able to do so again,  Ying-Ying.  I am too used to acting out  of fury and selfishness.  Even now, in  despair and self hatred over what I done and how much of a fool I have been, my  impulse is to lash out and destroy.  Were  I not so afraid of hurting you and Konatsu, I might have demolished this  house.  I have done so to my quarters in  my old castle often enough.”  She sighed  heavily.  “I have even carelessly killed  my maids many times in my rage.”</p><p>
  “Yet you regret this, and you would not do so again,  correct?”</p><p>
  Clove trembled.   “That’s just <em>it</em>,  Ying-Ying.  No matter how much I may  regret it <em>now</em>, what might I do when  the rage comes again?  What might I do  when the dragon within me roars?”  She  waved vaguely overhead.  “I have already  destroyed this room once.”</p><p>
  “I cannot tell you, Clove.  I do not know.  Yet I will do my best to help you if and when  you lose yourself within the black dragon’s rage.”  Ying-Ying reached out to stroke Clove’s  hair.  “On this you have my sacred  vow.  I will do all within my power to  help you learn how to control the animal rage.”</p><p>
  Clove chuckled ruefully.  “Provided I don’t <em>eat</em> you, of course.”  She  sighed.  “I wish my father had made a  better choice of a wife.  Why couldn’t he  have defeated a gold, or even a red?  Why  did he have to curse me to be a <em>black</em> dragon?”</p><p>
  “I have no idea.”</p><p>
  “Well, Konatsu feels like she might be waking  soon.”  Clove sighed.  “I should go for now.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying nodded.   “I am here whenever you want to talk, Clove.”</p><p>
  Clove smiled sadly as she looked down.  “I wish it were more than just talk,  Ying-Ying.”</p><p>
  The ghost nodded.   “I understand that as well, Clove.   Konatsu is not ready for that yet, though.  Once she is, we shall see.  That is all I can promise.”</p><p>
  “Don’t make me a promise that might hurt your soulmates,  Ying-Ying.”</p><p>
  “I won’t, Clove.   But once Konatsu has made her choices and come to us openly, who  knows?  We have never been an exclusive  group.  Had Zhu Shu’s fears of making  Ranma hate her not so overwhelmed her and caused her to distance herself from  him and Akane and Shan Pu, I would be sharing <em>their</em> bed already.  You may  yet have me as a lover, but only time will tell.  Already, if your account of her dreams is  true, something unexpected is occurring.   While Rei has been our lover in the past, it was not anticipated that  she would remain so in this lifetime.   That Konatsu is dreaming of her can only mean that at some level, she is  responding to the inactive soulbond with Rei.   That should <em>not </em>be  possible.  Things are happening that were  not foreseen, and events have not occurred as they were supposed to.  The future is growing ever more cloudy and  uncertain, and yet at the same time, there is greater and greater hope for  tomorrow.  You have created ripples on  top of ripples just by your returning to the stage, and I for one am not sorry  that you are here.  Were it not so  needful to keep you hidden from Hild, I would be very happy for you to stay  with us in your own body, nor would I object to your advances, were I not  wishing to be certain I will not cause my loved ones pain.”</p><p>
  Clove looked at her, a sad smile on her face.  “Almost, you make me hope.”  She chuckled ruefully.  “I have seduced girls without count, Ying-Ying,  had hundreds of lovers… and never has so little promised made my stomach flutter  so much.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying smiled.   “I know you wish for my heart as well as my body, Clove.  I know the longing you have to be loved, and  how much the experience of sharing Konatsu’s soulbond with me has made you  desire me.  All I can say is that I do  not know.  I know you <em>are</em> loved, more than you know, by the  Dragon, and that I am willing to give to you whatever I can that will not bring  pain to my soulmates.  Only time will  tell us both if that will be more than friendship and a willing ear.”</p><p>
  Clove chuckled.  “It would be so easy to charm you, Ying-Ying,  even though you are a ghost, yet for possibly the first time in my life I find  myself utterly unwilling to do so, and I cannot tell you why.  I want to possess you more than any woman I  have ever met, and yet, if you do not come to me of your own free will, I don’t  think I could stand to live with myself.   It is a feeling I have never felt before, and I cannot merely accept  that it is an effect of sharing Konatsu’s soulbond.  Yes, <em>perhaps </em>that is part of <em>why</em> you are so  desirable, and why it has developed so quickly, but it does not explain how I  feel <em>about</em> you.   I would rather worship you from afar and  never know the touch of your hand than to try and cage you and make you only  mine.”  </p><p>
  “Then perhaps you have learned the first and most  important thing about love, Clove.  It is  a gift that can only be given from a heart free to choose.”</p><p>
  Clove nodded as she lay back down.  “I think that was the mistake I made most  often in my past life.  I will try to not  make that mistake again, my lovely flower.”  </p><p>
  She lay there quietly as Ying-Ying stroked her hair,  and her eyes slowly closed. </p><p>
  When they fluttered open again a few minutes later,  Ying-Ying smiled at the joy she saw in Konatsu’s large brown eyes.</p><p>
  “Ohayo, Ying-chan!   I was having the most wonderful dreams.”</p><p>
  “So was I, Ko-chan.   So was I…”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Dawn found Ukyo returned to the cliff, her guan dao a  blur as she went through form after form.   Rei had held her as she had cried herself out, but had fallen asleep long  before Ukyo’s brain had passed into exhausted slumber.  She had been unable to stop thinking, about  her life, herself, and everything.  Even  her dreams had been a chaotic mélange of images from her past life and her  present, but they had helped her sort out what she had needed.  It was like some barrier had shattered and  crumbled away, leaving her no further defenses against what her heart already  knew.  She had woken in the miko’s arms  just before sunrise with a clear head, and a burning need to redeem herself of  the cowardice she had shown in the night.   She had come to the cliff to focus herself, using the physical exercise  as means to release the tensions in her body that the night had left in her  while she reviewed the calmness inside herself that she had woken up with.</p><p>
  And she <em>was</em> calm.  Oh, she was still angry with  herself for what had happened, she couldn’t deny that.  Zhu Shu had only wanted her love.  If she had simply responded equally, had not  been afraid of what she herself had invited… She had kissed Zhu Shu knowing  what her fiancée desired, and how desperately.   She had only herself to blame for the fear she shown.  The dark shadows of the night had been  remorseless in showing her the truth about so many things, and no matter how  ashamed she was at herself, and how painful those realizations had been, she  was at peace with what she had decided to do.   The massive outpouring of energy she was throwing into her kata was like  the lancing of a boil, the cleansing away of an infection of her soul.</p><p>
  When the cliff face under her finally shattered and  collapsed from the ki she was pouring into her strikes, she realized that she  was no longer alone.</p><p>
  “You decide to imitate her and do your kata  nude?”  Rei asked as Ukyo landed on the  new cliff’s edge near her.</p><p>
  Ukyo looked down, realizing that she really had  forgotten to look for a new outfit in her driving need to meditate.</p><p>
  “Not really.  I  just wasn’t thinking.  I needed to work  off the pent up energy from being so angry with myself.</p><p>
  “You can’t blame yourself, Uc-chan.”</p><p>
  “Then <em>who</em> can I blame?” Ukyo asked mildly.   “Certainly not <em>her.</em>  All she wanted was the touch of the one she  loved so much that even in her state she was drawn to me.  She loves me so much that even losing her  mind couldn’t make her forget!  And what  did I do!  I was so scared of the <em>strength</em> of her love that I turned what  should have been her salvation into her damnation instead!  I can still feel how she felt, Rei!  She was going to kill herself!  I know she hasn’t, because I can still feel  that she’s there, but she won’t respond to anything I try to send to her.  She’s cut herself off from our connection  because she feels so ashamed!  <em>AND IT’S ALL! MY! FAULT!!!”</em></p><p>
  Rei winced as Ukyo’s voice had risen from quiet  sadness to an angry shout.  “I might have  been scared too, Ukyo.  From what you  said, she <em>was</em> being pretty  scary.  She’s <em>never</em> overwhelmed me like that.   I <em>always</em> had to make the first  move.”</p><p>
  “She couldn’t help herself, Rei.  She wasn’t in real control of her own  mind.  It’s like she was an animal, like  her consciousness was asleep inside her, and I woke her up.  I woke her up and instead of love, she found  nothing but fear.”</p><p>
  “Uc-chan… Zhu Shu is a very wise person.  I’m certain that once she has had a chance to  think it through rationally, once she realizes what happened, she’ll  understand.  You haven’t-</p><p>
  “You’re <em>wrong</em>,  Rei.  I saw what was in her mind.  She woke to find me helpless and frightened  under her while she was in the middle of a sexual frenzy.  She never gave me a chance to explain, and  she won’t let me in now.  But I saw  everything, Rei.  <em>Everything.</em>”  She threw the <em>Wrathseeker</em> at a nearby tree, the blade  piercing completely through the trunk.   “I don’t know what happened to make her like this, but she’s <em>hurting,</em> Rei.  She’s hurting and I could have saved her if I  hadn’t let my fears overcome me.  I knew  that kissing her was probably going to lead to sex.  I <em>thought</em> I was prepared to give myself to her.”   Ukyo finished, the anger finally gone from her voice, replaced by  sadness as she hugged herself and shivered.</p><p>
  “Ukyo, you’re upset and not thinking clearly.”</p><p>
  Ukyo shook her head.   “I am thinking more clearly right now than I think I ever have before,  Rei.  Like I said, I saw everything.  I saw exactly what Zhu Shu sees in me, why  she loves me, why she came to me.  And I  saw how much of an utter fool I’ve been.”</p><p>
  “Uc-chan…”</p><p>
  Ukyo turned and placed her hand on the slender girl’s  shoulder.  “I love her, Rei.  I’ve loved her since we first met.  I knew even then that I was going to be with  her forever, because I have loved her for a thousand years, across several  reincarnations.  My soul knew her, even  if my mind refused to let me believe.  I  bonded with her in the very second I looked into her eyes that first day, tied  myself to her so closely that we can even hear each others thoughts.  I love her, and I am <em>going</em> to save her.  I am  going to save her, and marry her, and devote the rest of my life to her,  because that is who <em>I am</em>, my beloved  Lady Phoenix.  It’s who I’ve <em>always</em> been.  I <em>AM</em> the Guardian of the Dragon, the warrior forged by the heat of the Dragon’s  flame to defend her heart.  But I let my  obsession with Ranma, and my rebellion against my dad’s wishes obscure what I  knew in my soul, to blind me to what Orihime has been trying to tell me.  Until last night, I still hoped I’d find some  way to marry Ranma.  Still hoped for the  impossible when so much more was right there in front of me.”</p><p>
  “Uc-chan… are… are you really sure, or are you just  upset still?”</p><p>
  Ukyo sighed.  “I  can’t deny that I am still upset, Rei.   But I think this is how I <em>really</em> feel.  I think this is how I will feel  from now on.  It’s <em>because</em> I feel this way that I <em>am</em> so upset.  The confusion is gone.  It was already fading, but last night just  made it perfectly clear.  As I lay there  in your arms while you held me through the night, I realized how much of a fool  I was to still hope I could have Ranma.   I can see the happiness he has in Shan Pu and Akane, and I wanted that  same happiness.  And that’s when I  realized that I already had it, if I had just been willing to open my eyes and  see reality instead of clinging to a six-year-old’s childish dream.  I’ve made my peace with Orihime, accepted  fully who I am.  I don’t doubt anymore,  Rei.  Male, female, animal, I don’t care  what she is.  I love her, and nothing is  going to stand in the way of my saving her from Naraku and telling her  that.  <em>Nothing.</em>”</p><p>
  Rei smiled sadly.   “I’m glad you’re not confused anymore, Uc-chan,” she said wistfully,  thinking about her plans to continue wooing the chef.  Ukyo probably wouldn’t want to experiment any  more now that she thought she was sure of her feelings, and Rei had wanted more  than anything to have been able to share herself with this girl whose soul was  so akin to her own, to have given herself as completely to the flames which  burned within them both.  Usagi would  forever have her loyalty, friendship, and devotion as a Warrior of the Moon  Kingdom, but as she felt her eyes start to fill with tears, she realized her <em>heart</em> had always belonged to the Dragon.  She thought again about the Phoenix on Ukyo’s back, the Dragon’s hand reaching,  but not touching.  <em>So close, yet forever apart…</em></p><p>
  Then she found her chin gripped by Ukyo’s hand and  lifted to where she had to meet the other girl’s eyes.  Ukyo’s lips met hers and she found herself  embraced tightly as Ukyo’s ki poured into her and filled her with its shining  azure light.  She melted into the chef’s  arms as she felt her own energies surging in response to Ukyo’s, and she  surrendered to the flames that suddenly flared within her with supernova  heat.  Their combined ki shimmered around  them both in a whirlwind of blue and violet merging into lavender, spiraling  faster and faster until her henshin began involuntarily as she felt her body  shudder in orgasm.</p><p>
  And as the mystical energies of her transformation fed  into the vortex of power that surrounded them and burned away her tears, in the  back of her mind a little butterfly spread its wings, and whispered <em>&lt;&lt;I love you too, my glorious Soul of  Fire.&gt;&gt;</em></p><p>
  As the vertigo faded and she could think again, she  looked into Ukyo’s lovely hazel eyes and blinked in absolute amazement.</p><p>
  “I may be marrying Zhu Shu, Rei,” Ukyo said as Rei  felt a gentle mental caress through the link.   “But <em>you’re</em> coming on the honeymoon  too.  You see, that was the other thing I  realized as I lay there last night.  I  don’t care what <em>destiny</em> might have  planned; Fate can go to hell.  I <em>need</em> you, my lovely Phoenix.  I need you every bit as much as I need Zhu  Shu.  I had you once, oh so long ago, and  now that I have you again, I’m never going to let you go.”</p><p>
  Ukyo turned and wrenched the <em>Wrathseeker</em> out of the tree, then smiled at the stunned priestess  over her shoulder.  “Now, it’s time to  find some clothes and make some tracks towards the Hasai domain.  <em>Our</em> beloved dragoness needs rescuing,” she said as she turned towards the village  and walked under the trees with a provocative hip sway.</p><p>
  Yet it wasn’t Ukyo’s hips Rei was staring at, but the  tattoo, where the Phoenix had landed on the palm of the Dragon’s outstretched  hand, the crimson ribbon trailing from the <em>Dragon’s  Wrath</em> gripped in its beak and looped into the shape of two hearts  intertwined…</p><p>
  And she could swear the Dragon was smiling.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Ukyo wasn’t the only one that dawn had found  awake.  Kuno had seen the chef leaving  the village as he had entered the central square, and despite his surprise at  her unclothed state, he had managed to put the sight out of his mind as he had  assumed a stance and began slowly to work through his forms.  It had been difficult, and the vision of her  naked body had intruded multiple times, but he did his best to overcome his  animal lusts and focus on the purity of the warrior’s art.</p><p>
  As Ukyo’s naked figure swam before his imagination  again, he forced himself to remember.  </p><p>
  <em>The shadow’s eyes glowed as he resumed a  stance.  “Then kill me if you can,  mortal.  I have slain far greater devil  hunters than you.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“You shall kill no more.  I will defend my goddess to my last breath.” he  said quietly.</em></p><p>
  <em>The blade pulsed again, almost shaking  the walls with its noiseless throb.</em></p><p>
  <em>The room darkened once more as the  Shadow seemed to suck in all the light, his sword growing even darker as blood  red runes began to glow with a dusky light.</em></p><p>
  <em>“Then come, Devil Hunter.  My sword will enjoy the taste of your soul!”</em></p><p>
  <em>The shadow lunged, the last vestiges of  light vanishing as the room plunged into darkness…</em></p><p>
  <em>And Kuno found himself standing before a  vision of light.  She was glorious,  radiant, a true goddess.  Time vanished  as he found his breath taken away by her loveliness, and all thought fled  before his desire…</em></p><p>
  <em>“I – I would-</em></p><p>
  <em>“Date with me, Tatewaki?  Would you force yourself upon me as you have  hounded so many others?  Would you let  the animal side of your heritage control you as you have for so long?  Is this all that you are?”</em></p><p>
  <em>He was dumbstruck, his hands going numb  as his knees gave way.  Through his mind  ran memories upon memories of all the girls he had loved, of Akane, Kyoko, Zhu  Shu, the kettle girl.  And he felt again  and again the blows they had rained on him, the scorn, the anger.  And he knew that the figure before him could  see it all.</em></p><p>
  <em>“Is </em>this<em> all that you are, Tatewaki?”</em></p><p>
  <em>Shame ripped through him.  “I – I am Tatewaki Kuno… the… the Blue  Thunder of…”</em></p><p>
  <em>“I know what you wish to be  Tatewaki.  I know the despair which has  driven you, the desire.  I can help you  become the noble samurai you long to be, Tatewaki.  I can make you in truth a Devil Hunter. Like  I have done for your ancestors, I can give you the strength to defeat this  shadow… but why should I, Tatewaki?  How  have you earned that strength?</em></p><p>
  <em>Kuno’s head bowed as he cried.  “I – I cannot say, my goddess.”</em></p><p>
  <em>The glowing figure laughed like crystal  chimes.  “I am no goddess, Tatewaki.  I am simply a servant of the Light.  You stand now at a crossroad of your life,  Tatewaki.  You have chosen to defend the  Avatar of the Dragon, the girl Song Zhu Shu.   Your reasons are self centered, and in part delusion, yet you have shown  the bravery which you hide so well behind the mask of a fool.  You have shown your courage in the face of  certain death, but alone you cannot overcome this foe.  Together we can defeat this demon of  darkness, but there is a choice you must make.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“Please, tell me!”</em></p><p>
  <em>“Who do you want to be Tatewaki?  Who do you chose to be?  Will you remain what you are, or will you  seek to become what you have dreamed?  I have  awakened to slay this enemy, and once he is vanquished, my task is done.  I can return to my long sleep, take from you  this memory of our meeting, and leave you as you have always been.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“Or I can give you the strength to  destroy him </em>yourself,<em> and you can be what the Kuno line was  founded to be: a bastion against the darkness which threatens mankind, a Devil  Hunter.  Like my beloved Inuyasha, you  can overcome your animal nature, use the youkai blood you bear to be a servant  of the light, and be the noble warrior you have always dreamed of being.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“But remember always, Tatewaki, as you  are, you will live a long life, and exist in perfect safety.  But should you choose to be what you dream,  you will never know which day will be your last, for no Devil Hunter ever dies  in peace.  You will trade the surety of  life for the certainty of death.”</em></p><p>
  <em>Somewhere, he found the strength to  stand.  He pushed himself erect and  lifted his head to stare directly at the blinding figure before him.</em></p><p>
  <em>“I wish to serve the Light.”</em></p><p>
  <em>The figure nodded and stepped forward,  the light fading to reveal a beautiful raven haired woman in miko robes.  She placed a hand on his shoulder and gave  him a soft smile.</em></p><p>
  <em>“It will not be easy, Tatewaki.  You bear within you not only the animal  nature of your inugami ancestry, but the demonic lusts of your succubus  mother.  Your strength comes from this,  but it is also your greatest weakness.   You are controlled by lust, and oblivious to how it has overridden your  life.  It has made of  you a fool, like another I knew so long  along. A truly noble warrior respects a woman, because she represents  everything he is fighting to protect - Hearth and Home and Life itself.  You have chosen to defend Zhu Shu.  Will you defend her only to defile her?  Would you </em>take<em> what you have not been  freely given?”</em></p><p>
  <em>He hung his head in shame.  “I would not.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“It is no different for </em>any<em> woman,  Tatewaki.  You will find love, but you  must be worthy of her.  You must be  someone she can trust, or you will forever walk alone.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“I would be worthy.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“Then show me your warriors heart,  Tatewaki. Take my power, and show me your strength!”</em></p><p>
  <em>And he had found himself able to see the  shadow even in the darkness that suddenly replaced the light, his sword grown  giant in his hand as the demon’s blade shattered against it…</em></p><p>
  <em>Then he had failed immediately in his  fight against himself, and Akane and Shan Pu had reminded him quickly why he  must fight to control the demon within… just as his sword had stayed silent  these many days, until she had relented and answered his plea the other day.</em></p><p>
  <em>Because to be a Devil Hunter, to be  worthy of being a defender against the demons of the dark, he would have to  defend against the demon within </em>himself<em> first, last, and always.</em></p><p>
  <em>To be worthy…</em> </p><p>
  “I must be worthy!” he growled as he banished the  thoughts of Ukyo’s nakedness from his mind again.</p><p>
  “Worthy of what, Master swordsman?” Kagura’s voice  asked from the door of a nearby hut.  “I  have watched you at this practice for days, and always you seem to fight  against some demon only you can see.”</p><p>
  Tatewaki finished his form and slowly stood, returning  his sword to its sheath before he turned and bowed.  “I doth fight against myself, Lady  Kagura.  I must forever war against the  demon within mine own soul.”</p><p>
  “Indeed.  What  sort of demons drive you, Sir Kuno?  I  can sense the almost pure youkai blood within you.  You are more than just a hanyo, though  nowhere near the strength of a dai-youkai such as Sesshomaru.  You share the blood of another strain I am  unfamiliar with.</p><p>
  Kuno sighed.  “T’is  that nature within me against which I strive, Lady Kagura.  I was unaware of it during her life, but it  has been revealed to me that my mother was a pure blood youkai, a succubus, one  of the night predators of humanity.  T’is  against the unnatural lusts with which her heritage has afflicted me that I  fight.”</p><p>
  Kagura tilted her head.  “I know little of such matters, Sir  Kuno.  I have had no experience with the  things that men and women do in my short life.   Naraku has little care for such matters, despite the desires his heart  has for the priestess Kikyou.”</p><p>
  “Thou knowest nothing of the affairs of men with  women?  Gladly would I - ” Kuno  stopped.  “Nay, there I start once more  to play the fool.  Just because I find thee  comely is insufficient reason to suppose thou wouldst feel as I.  My apologies, My Lady.”</p><p>
  Kagura blinked.   “You – you find me comely?”</p><p>
  Tatewaki bowed.   “Indeed I doth, Lady Kagura.  Thee  move with the very grace of the wind, and thine eyes are like the embers of a  setting sun, full of warmth and beauty.”</p><p>
  Kagura laughed, her fan coming up to cover her face as  she blushed.  “No – no one has ever  called my eyes beautiful, Sir Kuno.”</p><p>
  “I am truly shamed for my gender then, my Lady.  I must apologize on behalf of the entirety of  mankind for such a grievous oversight.”</p><p>
  Kagura smiled at him.   “I suppose what you are doing is attempting to ‘charm’ me?”</p><p>
  Kuno smiled ruefully.   “Ah, indeed I am.  Once again I  play the fool.”</p><p>
  Kagura shook her head.   “I think it’s quite fascinating.   Do human women actually respond to such flowery speeches?”</p><p>
  “Occasionally.”</p><p>
  “Humm.”  She  placed her hands on her obi.  “Well,  since you like my eyes so much, would you answer another question for me, Sir  Kuno?”</p><p>
  “Anything, my Lady.”</p><p>
  The obi and yakuta dropped to the doorstep as she  stood before him naked.  “Do you find my  body appealing too?”</p><p>
  Kuno blinked… then blinked again, then nodded right  before his eyes rolled up in his head and he passed out.</p><p>
  Kagura pouted.   “Damn it!  How am I supposed to  have him engage in sex if he passes out from seeing me naked?”</p><p>
  Merry laughter came from the door to the next hut,  where Nabiki and Tao-Ching had been staying, and she turned to see the bunnygirl  giving her a huge grin.  “Way to go  Kagura baby!  I don’t think anyone’s ever <em>volunteered</em> to show him their body  before.  Don’t worry.  He recovers quickly.”</p><p>
  “But will he do this every time?  How am I supposed to learn about human love  if he passes out on me?”</p><p>
  Nabiki gave her a lascivious eye.  “Like I said, if you just want to learn about  sex, Kagura, Tao-Ching and I would be more than happy to teach you.”</p><p>
  “You are partnered.   And noisy.  However, our  conversations did get me curious.  This  one has no other partner and I need not worry that his simple mind would seek  to deceive me, nor do I need fear the jealousy of anyone as he is  unwanted.  And… and there is something  about him.”</p><p>
  Nabiki raised an eyebrow.  “About <em>Kuno?</em>”</p><p>
  Kagura nodded as she dusted off her yakuta and put it  back on.  “I cannot explain it.  He is like a stray puppy.”</p><p>
  Nabiki shrugged.   “Yeah, I’ll give you that.  Kuno  has been the king of puppy love since I’ve known him.  Well, to each their own and all that.  Just remember, the offer’s open, and try not  to let dog boy there break your heart.”</p><p>
  Kagura tightened her obi.  “I do not even know if I have a heart to  break in such a manner, Nabiki.  It has  only been days since I have had a heart at all.”</p><p>
  “Well, feel free to ask for advice if you want it.”</p><p>
  “There is one thing I would ask.  Would you by any chance have an idea what a  ‘succubus’ is?”</p><p>
  Nabiki raised an eyebrow.  “Um… they’re a western youkai.  A spirit of sexual lust and depravity that  preys on men.  Basically a spirit that  feeds on desire and sex.”</p><p>
  Kagura’s eyes widened.   “Interesting youkai.”  She  contemplated the unconscious form of Kuno.  </p><p>
  “Better wait till tonight, Kagura-chan.  Don’t think we have time right now.” Nabiki  laughed.</p><p>
  Kagura pouted again.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Nabiki and Tao-Ching both blinked when Ukyo came out  of her hut just prior to their departure.   The chef had abandoned her typical tomboy look entirely to dress in  something that left no doubt that she was a female.  </p><p>
  It was a simple outfit, but striking.  The actual shirt was a heavy leather halter,  the shaped leather cupping her substantial breasts from the side but leaving  her cleavage fully exposed.  The cups  were cut and embossed in an ornamental flower pattern, the outlines of the  petals dyed a rich red, and they attached to a heavy leather belt that covered  her stomach like a corset, leaving her shoulders completely bare.  The belt covered her midriff, the matching floral  patterned, roughly oval buckle on the front molding itself to her flat stomach,  but it was cut high around the hips, the rear flaring out into a small skirt  and it was laced up the center under the buckle  with a scarlet cord that was tied into a small  bow at the bottom of the belt, the long ends that dropped down to her knees  doing nothing to conceal the narrow black thong that was all Ukyo was  concealing her pubic region with.  Her  separated sleeves - identical to the ones on Rei’s miko robes but dyed black -  tied at the top around her upper arm with red ribbons and were very wide at the  cuff, where a second red ribbon threaded through the edge to allow the sleeve  to be tied shut.  They almost concealed  the sturdy bracers she wore, the black leather decorated in the same ornamental  flower patterns as the shaped leather top, and equipped with hinged plates that  guarded the back of her hands.  Her legs  were covered in thigh high black silk stockings with wide slits in the sides  that were tied at the top in the same red cord as her belt, over which there  were shin guards matching the bracers.   The stockings had no bottoms, the black silk coming to a point between  her toes where a strap went between her toes and then split to tie in a small  bow behind her ankle.  She had also found  a set of geta that were simple solid platforms about three inches thick carved  from a heavy dark colored wood.  She saw  the look Nabiki was giving her and turned to let the bunnygirl see that her  thong was string backed, and that the small leather ‘skirt’ attached to the  back of the belt only came about halfway down her shapely derrière.  Nabiki had to lick her lips.</p><p>
  “Nice outfit there Ukyo.  Semi-traditional, yet oh so sexy.”</p><p>
  Ukyo looked down and shrugged.  “It’s about as close as I could find to  Orihime’s usual clothes, except I couldn’t find a loincloth I liked, so I said  fuck it and just stuck with the thong.   One half of me feels completely natural, and the other half thinks I  look like an ecchi pinup.”  She stretched  and adjusted herself in the top as she slung her bandolier and <em>Wrathseeker</em> on her shoulder.  “The biggest annoyance is that I don’t  normally wear bras, and I’ve spent so many years keeping my breasts bound that  it feels weird to have them loose.  I’d  never really thought before about how big they are.  Fortunately the cups are just a little tight,  so I don’t have to worry about falling out of them unless I hang upside down  and give them a good jolt, but my tits feel like they’re on a platter.”</p><p>
  Rei had come out of the hut behind her in time to hear  the last comment.  “I think you look  quite nice when you don’t have them all wrapped up in those bandages,” she said  as she pulled up her glove.  She had  managed to find a very form fitting short and sleeveless red cheongsam with  gold trim, and matching stockings and gloves with a thinner set of sandals.  The slits on the sides of the skirt came up  to her waist, and showed the ties on the sides of her matching red panties.</p><p>
  Ukyo smiled as she admired Rei’s slender figure in the  just barely long enough dress, then stepped up to the priestess, pressing her  breasts against her as she wrapped her arms around the taller girl.  “Do they feel as nice as they look?”</p><p>
  Rei blushed furiously.   “Uc-chan!  Don’t tease me.”</p><p>
  “Who’s teasing?   I decided to wear this in hopes <em>you’d</em> enjoy looking at me in it.  I certainly  did not put myself on display just so those two could enjoy the view.” She  jerked her head at Nabiki and Tao-Ching.</p><p>
  Nabiki giggled.   “Humm.  Looks like the pursuer has  become the pursued.”</p><p>
  Ukyo shrugged, then leaned forward to kiss Rei  passionately.  When she finally came back  up for air she gave Nabiki a grin.  “If  she hadn’t been there for me last night, Nabiki, I might have done something  really dumb.  I needed her love then, and  I need it now.  I’ve finally realized I  love Zhu Shu, and you and I both know she loves Rei too.  I wouldn’t make Zhu Shu choose, and I don’t  want to.  So I took a cue from Ranma and  decided to start my own little harem.”</p><p>
  “If you can’t fight it, might as well enjoy it, humm?”</p><p>
  “Absolutely, sugar.”   She looked at Rei again.  “I  needed my little firebird to light the way, but now that she has, I am finally  contented.  I made a horrible mistake  last night because I was afraid of what I didn’t want to be true.  Now that I have accepted the truth, I’m not  afraid anymore.  I just wish I had  overcome my fear without having hurt Zhu Shu so badly.”</p><p>
  “Going to become a happy lesbian?”</p><p>
  Ukyo stuck her tongue out.  “Hell no.   I like guys, thank you very much!   I just happen to be in love with a couple of girls too.   I’m sure eventually I’ll find some stud muffin  or six to keep as playtoys.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching raised a paw.  Nabiki doubled over giggling.  “The big lug is volunteering,” she said  affectionately.</p><p>
  Ukyo grinned.   “I’ll keep that in mind.”  She  turned to look to where Rei’s hand had firmly cupped itself to her behind.  “However, I think we had better get moving or  I might not be able to keep these clothes on for long.”</p><p>
  Rei blushed and started to take her hand away only to  have it clamped by Ukyo’s as the chef put her other arm around the miko.  </p><p>
  Nabiki shook her head and laughed.  “You can’t blame her, Ukyo.  That outfit makes <em>me</em> want to get you out of it too.   Hers isn’t too hard on the eyes either.   You better <em>both </em>keep an eye  out for Miroku’s roaming hands,” she said as she turned Tao-Ching around and  started sauntering towards the front gate.</p><p>
  They turned to follow the big cat and the bunnygirl,  and Ukyo smiled as Rei’s hand just <em>casually</em> found its way under the string back and wandered lower, all while Rei was doing  her best to look absolutely innocent…</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>The Blackmoon didn’t seem to waste much time mourning  the loss of the Phantom sister they had captured, at least that was Akane’s  impression when she got the call on her watch just as lunch was starting.  Luna was certain something was going on at  Hikawa shrine, even if she couldn’t put a paw on it exactly.  It seemed Rei’s grandfather had gotten some  wild idea about starting a self defense aerobics class, and some strange things  were occurring ever since this large woman had started fighting everyone.  </p><p>
  “Take Shan Pu and go,” Ranma said as she had closed  the watch.  “She’s been pouting since  last night.  I’ll cover for you in class  if you’re not back by the end of lunch.”</p><p>
  Akane nodded.   “Okay.  I did promise her she  could fight the next youma.  We better  hurry though.”</p><p>
  “Give Shan Pu second to change, myah!” the Chinese  girl said as she pulled out a small bundle from behind her back, and started  stripping, her tail lashing in excitement.</p><p>
  Ranma looked around the deserted section of the school  yard, hidden away from the athletics field by a wing of the school on one side,  and the administrative extension on the other.   “You really should be careful when you start getting undressed,  Shan-chan.”</p><p>
  She handed him her cheongsam and shoes.  “Shan Pu look, nyah.  No-one here see.”  She pulled up a black silk stocking wrapped  by a gold tiger quickly, and Ranma admired the shapely curves of her legs.  Then Shan Pu had the other one on and was  pulling on a tight black top that looked rather familiar.</p><p>
  “Hey, that looks like - ”</p><p>
  “Akane outfit dyed black, yes nyah?”  Shan Pu giggled as she straightened her gold  trimmed fuku and fluffed her bow around her tail.  “Shan Pu make one in black for Shan Pu, and one  in red for Ran-myah.”</p><p>
  Akane smiled as she was finishing her henshin.  “Cute.   So you can match my sailor form and maybe not be so recognizable?”</p><p>
  Shan Pu tugged on her second glove and nodded.  She reached up and quickly undid her odango,  shaking out her hair and then donning a large pair of wrap around  sunglasses.  “Now no-one recognize!” she  said with a happy mew.</p><p>
  Ranma almost doubled over laughing.  “Except for the cat tail and ears,  Shan-kitty.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu tapped her fingers on her arm as she gave the  red-head a cool look.  “It work Senshi,  it work Shan Pu!”</p><p>
  “Yeah yeah.  Now  you two scoot.  Go save the world and all  that.”</p><p>
  She chuckled as she turned to walk back to the  athletic field, waving at the two rapidly disappearing girls.  If whoever they were off to fight was as  inept as the previous two, they shouldn’t take very long.  They’d pulverize the poor thing.</p><p>
  As she walked along, it never even occurred to her to  marvel at the fact that she trusted her fiancées abilities as much as she  believed in her own, and what a difference that was from the Ranma who had  walked into the Musk fortress not so long ago…</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>The principal’s secretary turned from watching Ranma  through her window to fix Kodachi with an evil eye behind her large round  glasses.  The gymnast was sitting  somewhat meekly before her desk, with Mousse by her side.  She leaned back against the windowsill, her  sharp nails tapping one by one with little clicks like a spider walking across  glass.</p><p>
  “Miss Kuno, not only have you missed most of a week of  school, now you show up in  inugami form  with a request to allow this undocumented Chinese boy to attend Furinkan?  I don’t know what they let you get away with  at St. Hebereke, but you should set an example here in <em>Furinkan</em> - for your father’s sake.   Even if he has been missing for the last few years, he is still this  school’s principal.”</p><p>
  “We both know my father has gone insane, Miss  Tsuchigumo.  It’s only my family’s  lawyers who keep his position open here.   And pay to keep up with the repairs necessitated by my brothers little  rampages.”</p><p>
  “You’ve had your share of those too, Miss Kuno.  We are still repairing the gym’s roof  following your attempt to murder Shan Pu.”</p><p>
  Mousse sighed.   “Mistress, you did not tell me you actually tried to <em>kill</em> her.”</p><p>
  Kodachi gave him a pained grin.  “I was somewhat insane at the time, Mousse.  I know that’s no excuse, but it’s the truth.”</p><p>
  Mousse shrugged.   “Amazons face every fight as if it will be their last.  Knowing Shan Pu, I have no doubt she sought  your death as well.”</p><p>
  Miss Tsuchigumo cleared her throat.  “Be that as it may, Miss Kuno, there is still  a need to maintain discipline.  You  already have a week’s detention for the missed school, but I must know if you  are planning to remain in your inugami form while you attend classes?”</p><p>
  Kodachi looked nervously at Mousse, but then  nodded.  “Yes, Miss Tsuchigumo.  I have spent sixteen years hiding my ears  under my hair.  I <em>will</em> not hide them anymore.   Akane Tendo, Nabiki Tendo, and the exchange student Lo Shen all have  rabbit ears, why should I hide those I was born with?”</p><p>
  “Those are the result of a curse, not youkai  ancestry.  Have you never heard of the  Accord?”</p><p>
  Kodachi shook her head.  “I have only recently become aware that I am  not alone in being youkai, Miss Tsuchigumo.   And I have been told that Furinkan allows youkai to attend as students.”</p><p>
  Miss Tsuchigumo crossed her arms.  And her arms.   And her arms…  Kodachi blinked at  the eight spider legs that had appeared out of the secretary’s back to cross  under her human arms.</p><p>
  “Indeed, Miss Kuno.   And they live by the Accord, and do not reveal themselves to  humans.  We live by the laws laid down by  your very own ancestors, Miss Kuno.”</p><p>
  Kodachi shrugged.   “Then perhaps it’s time for those laws to be reconsidered.  I <em>will  not</em> hide my ears, Miss Tsuchigumo.   My mother spent eleven years making me believe they were a curse, and  caused me untold pain by beating me any time I let them show.  Two days ago my shame at being cursed by them  drove me to throw myself off Tokyo tower.   Mousse saved me, both from myself and my shame.  I am, for the first time in my life, proud of  my family’s heritage, and proud to be an inugami.  I will not hide who I am anymore.”</p><p>
  Mousse’s hand tightened in hers, and she found the  courage to look the spider woman in her now multiple glittering eyes.</p><p>
  Then the spider smiled, her mandibles clicking.  “Very well, Miss Kuno.  But be aware you are on a very short leash as  of now.  I expect you to shape up your  act.  No more poisons, paralysis gas,  sleeping potions, aphrodisiacs, or any other little concoctions from your  greenhouse of horror.  Understand?  You are hereby limited to your skills as a  gymnast alone.  No more nasty little  tricks.  I’ve had it up to <em>here</em> with having to make antidotes!” </p><p>
  Kodachi looked at the spider leg that stretched up to  touch the ceiling and sighed.  “Yes, Miss  Tsuchigumo.  Mousse and I had already  talked about that, and I had promised him to stop making poisons.  It is not an <em>honorable</em> weapon for an Amazon warrior.”</p><p>
  The secretary nodded.   “As for you, Mu Si -”</p><p>
  “Mousse, please, Miss Sukigummo.  Mu Si is dead, a ghost.  My Mistress has given me the name Mousse, and  I would prefer to use that.”</p><p>
  Kodachi winced at his mangling of the secretary’s  name, but the spider woman just gave him a grim smile.</p><p>
  “Very well, Mousse.   I have already been given your transcripts by Ke Lun, since she is your  registered guardian.  It seems she  expected you to seek entrance to the school eventually.  There was a note as well.  Leave Shan Pu alone.”</p><p>
  Mousse sighed heavily.   “I am dead to her, by Amazon law.   She will not acknowledge my existence.   Nothing I can do will change that.”</p><p>
  “Will you be attending primarily as a male or as a  female tenshi?”</p><p>
  “Which ever one my mistress prefers me to be.”</p><p>
  The spider woman rolled eight eyes ceilingward as she  sighed.  When she looked back down at  Kodachi she had resumed human form.  “<em>Nevermind.</em>  I know you’re bisexual Kodachi, and given  whom your mother was I know you can’t <em>help</em> your libido.  I’ll figure out some  designation for the records.  I am  tempted to go to this Jusenkyo and web the whole place out of existence.”  She stepped to her chair and sat down in it  as she picked up a pen.  “One last detail  before I send you off.  You are both  aware of the existence of youkai within this school.  Under no circumstances are you to expose any  of your fellow youkai to the humans who attend Furinkan.  You are getting away with letting your ears  show solely because of the existence of the Jusenkyo curses and the recent  enrollment of a guardian spirit.  Very  few humans remember the names of Inuyasha and Kagome, but many youkai revere  them for founding the Accord.  You come  from one of the most noble of all youkai families, Miss Kuno.  Please, <em>try</em> to be more worthy of the honor of your family’s name than you and your brother  have been till now.”</p><p>
  Kodachi stood and bowed.  “I will be worthy, Tsuchigumo-sama.”</p><p>
  “You had better.   I am reassigning you to the same home room as Akane Tendo, because that  is one of the designated youkai mixed classes.”</p><p>
  Kodachi’s breath caught and she swallowed hard.  “I – I understand, Tsuchigumo-sama.  I – I have abandoned my obsession for  her.  I will behave myself, and not  embarrass her, or myself, anymore.”</p><p>
  The secretary’s eyes softened.  “I am not doing this to be cruel,  Kodachi-san, though both Akane and Shan Pu are in that class.  But if you wish to display your ears, you will  cause the least disruption by being in the same class as a bunnygirl and a bakeneko  who are openly known to be such due to magical curses.  It’s the same reason I put the guardian  spirit Fei Ying-Ying in that class.  I  understand it will be difficult for you both, but I have to think of the  welfare of the school as a whole.  It  would not do to have you hated by some of the youkai for being allowed to show  your true form.”</p><p>
  Kodachi swallowed again and bowed.  “I will do my best, Tsuchigumo-sama.”</p><p>
  “I appreciate your effort, Kodachi-san.  You are dismissed.  Please take Mousse-kun to the counselor’s  office to be assigned courses, then you are free to attend your afternoon classes.”</p><p>
  Kodachi bowed again.   “May I be allowed to ask a question before I go, Tsuchigumo-sama?”</p><p>
  “Yes.”</p><p>
  “<em>What</em> was my  mother?  I know I am only <em>half </em>inugami, but I never knew that my  mother was also a youkai until recently.”</p><p>
  The secretary folded her hands together in front of  her face as her glasses caught the light and hid her eyes.  She was silent for a long moment before  speaking.  “Your mother was a full  blooded succubus, one who we did not <em>know</em> was one until she had already lured and enslaved your father.  Unlike the two succubae we have attending  Furinkan presently, she was one of the true creatures of darkness, one who  refused to live by the Accords.  We call  such creatures Chaosians, because they seek to create chaos.  She wished for you to become just what she  was, a predator on the wealthy and noble, binding them to you and allowing her  to control them through you.  She was  caught and her powers sealed before you were born, and fortunately you took  more after your inugami heritage and displayed none of the powers and abilities  of a succubus.   I am sorry for the pain  she caused you, Kodachi-chan, but with her controlling your father, our hands  were tied.  I am only glad she finally  removed herself when your powers did not develop following your first menstrual  cycle.  Forgive me for speaking so ill of  your mother, but I cannot pretend that I would not have gladly killed her given  an excuse.”</p><p>
  Kodachi blinked, her face pale.  “I – I see.”   She closed her eyes and took a deep shuddering breath, and slowly  exhaled before she bowed.  “I thank you truly,  Tsuchigumo-sama.  I – I believe that  clarifies many things.”  She clasped her  hands before her as she dropped to her knees and bowed again, tears streaming  from her eyes.  “Please accept my  grateful thanks.  I think at last I  understand why my mother hated me so much, and for that understanding, I cannot  ever repay you.  Thank you,  Tsuchigumo-sama.”</p><p>
  A long spider leg gently placed a box of tissue before  the crying girl.</p><p>
  “You can repay me, Kodachi-chan, by keeping ahold of  that pride and dignity that you displayed to me so ferociously when you  demanded to be allowed to display your ears, and never letting anyone ever tell  you again that your heritage is a curse.” </p><p>
  Kodachi stood, clutching the box of tissues and  dabbing her eyes.  She nodded, her eyes shining  brightly but her throat too tight to speak.</p><p>
  “I have been your father’s secretary for eighteen  years, Miss Kuno, and your grandfather’s for forty before that.  I have hated to see what that woman made of  the proud line of Kuno.  I am very glad  to see that pride again.”  She smiled and  made a shooing motion.  “You may use the  office bathroom to freshen up, Kodachi-chan, but do not forget I am this  school’s <em>administrator</em>.  I expect you to remember <em>all</em> that we spoke of.”  She  gave Kodachi a pointed look until the young girl nodded, then turned her  attention to the paperwork on her desk.</p><p>
  Kodachi and Mousse bowed and exited the office.  Miss Tsuchigumo pretended to be writing until  the door closed and then sat back in her chair, wiping a tear from her eye as  she contemplated.</p><p>
  <em>Poor little ‘Dachi-chan.  I had almost given you up for hopelessly  lost.  I knew I should have eaten your  mother first chance I had when I saw what she was doing to you and Tatewaki.  But what is a spider to do?  All I could do was watch helplessly as she  turned your father into a shell of a man and drove the two of you insane.  You’ve grown up into such a beautiful young  woman and I am so glad to see that you may finally be beginning to heal.  I know I’m just your father’s secretary, but  I’ve known you since you were born, and how I wish you had been </em>mine.</p><p>
  She nibbled on a silky lock of her web colored tresses  and smiled.  <em>And I think I’m happiest that you are finally willing to show the world  your lovely lovely hair…</em></p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ukyo and Rei’s choice of clothing had raised a few  more eyebrows, but other than Kagome’s comment that they were extremely  revealing, and Sango beating Miroku on the head with her boomerang when he  attempted to grab Ukyo’s rear end, Ukyo’s unrepentant attitude about her outfit  had settled the matter.  Sango had  admitted to Kagome that usually a body suit went with the other clothing Ukyo  had assembled, as well as some pieces of hip armor and shoulder guards.  Ukyo had simply shrugged and told them she  had worn all that she wanted of the outfit, and she wore less at the beach, so  why was everyone making an issue of it?   Rei had simply pointed out that her miko robes got in the way if she had  to use her bow, and her Sailor outfit was too conspicuous.</p><p>
  She and Rei rode on Tao-Ching as they jogged along  tied to Kirara, Nabiki having joined Kagura on her feather overhead.  The bunnygirl had decided as they were  leaving to try and see if she could maintain a constant shield outfit and still  do other things, and as they traveled, she had been randomly tossing buzzballs  at trees, leaving a string of them with holes along their path.  By midday, she seemed to be able to shoot two  at separate targets with decent odds of success, and still keep her glowing  pink copy of Sango’s armor over her plain body suit.</p><p>
  They stopped for lunch by a small waterfall near the  coast road that they were aiming for, and as Ukyo cooked okonomiyaki for them,  Kagome sat next to Kagura.</p><p>
  “I’ve been meaning to ask you, Kagura.  When I first asked you to join us, you  refused.  Why did you change your mind?”</p><p>
  Kagura gazed at her, her red eyes unreadable, then she  shrugged.  “Because at the time I truly  thought I could run away.  Sooner or  later, I think Naraku will kill us all, but the only real chance I have to <em>live</em> is by siding with you.  I can assure you, my reasons for being with  you are entirely due to self interest.”</p><p>
  Ukyo chuckled.   “That might have been true when you <em>first</em> met us, maybe even when you offered to teach Nabiki how to control her magical  abilities, but are you sure that’s still the case?”</p><p>
  “What other reason could I possibly have?”</p><p>
  Kagome gave her a smile.  “Friendship maybe?”</p><p>
  Kagura blinked.   “Friendship?  I am a creation of  Naraku.  You all know it, and I don’t  truly understand why you even protected me from Hakudoushi, let alone asked me  to join you.  I keep wondering what  misstep I will make which will lead to you killing me.  You are just the only hope I have of  living.  We both know the things I have  done in Naraku’s service.  How could I  even think you could be serious in offering me friendship?”</p><p>
  “Maybe because  the offer’s genuine.” Nabiki offered from where she was lounging against  Tao-Ching.  “I mean, do you think I saved  your life from those wasps just because you’re teaching me?”</p><p>
  “Of course.”</p><p>
  Nabiki shook her head.   “It never even crossed my mind, Kagura baby.  I saved you entirely because I consider you  my <em>friend.</em>  You’ve been in my head, and I’ve offered to  share my bed and my fiancé with you.  I  don’t do that for enemies or to people I’m just using.  I’m a very cynical person, just like you are,  Kagura.  I make a living <em>using</em> people, that’s why I’m known as an  Ice Queen.”</p><p>
  “Indeed, my Lady.   I hath played the fool many times before Nabiki Tendo, and I hath paid  dearly for doing so.” Kuno added from across the grill, where he was carefully  polishing his <em>Tetsusaiga.</em>  “She doth have a keen eye for profit, and is  feared by all in Furinkan.  Her  friendship is given to few, and sought by many.”</p><p>
  “I know you’ve done some bad things, and nearly killed  us a few times,” Kagome said.  “But you  didn’t have much of a choice if Naraku was holding your heart.  You don’t have that hanging over you now, and  I just wanted you to know we really do want you to be our friend.”</p><p>
  Kagura looked over at Inuyasha.  “Even you?”</p><p>
  The white haired boy shrugged.  “Look, I ain’t going to say I trust you  completely, but I have to admit Kagome’s right.   You were being used by Naraku.   You’re not now.  I’m even  beginning to notice that you smell less and less like Naraku as each day  passes.  You haven’t earned my trust yet,  but I ain’t gonna let Naraku kill you either.”</p><p>
  “Kekeke.  How  sentimental.  How <em>disappointing</em>. You’ve grown <em>soft</em> since I gave you back your heart, Kagura.”</p><p>
  A pink hemisphere appeared over the campsite in a  heartbeat as the rest of the group whirled to face the new voice.  Inuyasha growled as he saw the figure of  Naraku hovering above the small cliff over the waterfall, his shield glimmering  around him darkly.</p><p>
  “Please, don’t get excited on <em>my</em> account.  I simply came to  deal with some unfinished business.” the demonic youkai said as he smiled  evilly.  “Oh, and to give you some  wonderful news, of course.”</p><p>
  Inuyasha jumped out of Nabiki’s shield and unleashed a  windscar, growling in frustration as Naraku’s barrier absorbed it and the  shimmering winds simply circled around it pointlessly.</p><p>
  “Dammit!”</p><p>
  Naraku chuckled again as he hurled the white haired  boy into the ground by returning the windscar at him.  “And here I thought you would enjoy hearing  about your little lost dragon girl.”</p><p>
  Ukyo’s eyes narrowed.   “What have you done to her now, you bastard!”</p><p>
  “I?  I have done  nothing Ukyo Kuonji.  It is not <em>I</em> who is the cause of her present  suffering.  I have simply struck a  bargain with her.  She seeks death, so I  have offered to free her from the burden of her life in exchange for the final  shards of the Shikon no Tama.  It seems  she much prefers to die at <em>my</em> hand  rather than await the vengeance she believes <em>you</em> are coming to deliver.”</p><p>
  <em>Wrathseeker</em> dropped from her nerveless fingers as she realized  the depth of Naraku’s cruelty, and knew without a doubt that her soulmate truly  expected Ukyo to be hunting her down to kill her.  What did she have to go on but the rage Ukyo  had displayed at their engagement?  How  much worse would it be after being raped by the dragon girl?  She had cut herself off from their link out  of shame, her last feelings from Ukyo those of terror caused entirely by Zhu  Shu’s actions.  Her knees gave way as the  guilt of hurting her soulmate, of giving Naraku so easy a means of driving Zhu  Shu beyond the brink of utter despair, overwhelmed her.  She barely even heard Rei howl beside her as  the air suddenly grew hot and the very sky around Naraku ignited with the Senshi’s  wrath.</p><p>
  The rest of the group shielded their faces as the  waterfall outside Nabiki’s shield vaporized and the vegetation charred  instantly to ash.  Sweat rolled down the  bunnygirl’s face as she focused on keeping a barrier between themselves and the  plasma released by Rei’s furious assault on the bubble of darkness around the  monstrous form of Naraku.  Then Rei fell  to her hands, her breath coming in gasps as the fire in the sky died away.</p><p>
  Scattered tatters of flesh swirled around the rapidly  reassembling head of the evilly smiling demon. </p><p>
  “Impressive, if futile.  I hold your companion’s heart in my hand in  place of Kagura’s.  Fighting me will gain  you nothing but her death.  But please,  do come to Mikado.  I will have no  further use for her once she has retrieved the shards, so I will even offer you  a bargain.  Her life, for Kagura’s.  After all, a traitor deserves only  death.  Bring her to me at Mikado castle,  and I will grant you the dragon girl.”</p><p>
  As his head faded along with the remaining scraps of  his regenerating body, his evil laughter remained to taunt them all.</p><p>
  Then Ukyo felt a hand on her shoulder, and she looked  up to see Kagura’s red eyes.</p><p>
  “I cannot expect you to trust me, because I am indeed  a traitor, nor do I expect that Naraku intended to cause anything but strife  and dissension among us with his offer to exchange me for your friend, but for  what it is worth, I am sorry that my life has been bought with your pain and  that of your friends.”</p><p>
  Ukyo shook her head.   “It isn’t your fault, Kagura.   It’s mine, and <em>only</em> mine, and  only I can undo the harm I have caused.”</p><p>
  Sango was looking worriedly at the spot where Naraku  had been.  “I am worried that he means to  send your friend after Kouga and Kohaku.   If she takes my brother’s shard she will take away his life.”</p><p>
  Ukyo swallowed hard against the lump in her  throat.  “I don’t know Sango.  The Zhu Shu I know would never kill unless  she had no other choice.”</p><p>
  Sango and Kagura both shook their heads.  “Under Naraku’s control-” Kagura said, “She  would kill even you.”</p><p>
  Ukyo shivered.   “He has her believing I’m on my way to kill her instead of rescue her,  and he has set her to guard the castle where we have to go to save her.  I get the feeling he plans to <em>make</em> her kill me before he finally kills  her himself.  If she gets him all of that  jewel, he’ll have accomplished his goal, right?   And I doubt she has any idea that she is being set up to hand the  bastard the key to even more power.  All  his offer of a trade was for was an attempt to get us to doubt you, and hand  you over without a fight.”</p><p>
  Kagura nodded.   Then a shadow fell over her, and she looked up to see Inuyasha.</p><p>
  “I still ain’t going to say I trust you, Kagura.  But I will tell you this.  If that bastard wants to lay a finger on you,  he’s going to have to go through me to do it.”</p><p>
  “And I as well, my Lady.” Tatewaki said as he knelt  before her.  “We will rescue my goddess,  and deliver thee forever from the hand of this vile fiend.  I, Tatewaki Kuno, will swear to thee that we  shall slay the demon Naraku.  I will vow  on my very life that his cruelty shall end, because I know already that he will  be slain.  And he was slain by this very  sword upon which I swear.  Take heart, my  friends, my companions.  Take heart and  sorrow not, for history itself doth tell us that we shall prevail.”</p><p>
  Ukyo’s hand wrapped around the <em>Wrathseeker</em>, and she somehow found the strength to stand.  “He’s right.   This is our past.  We already <em>know</em> that Naraku will die.”</p><p>
  She reached down to grip the shoulder of her sobbing  soulmate, and gently lifted her to her feet.   “We’re going to <em>win</em>, Rei.  We’re going to get her back and that bastard  is going to <em>die.</em>”</p><p>
  She held the miko close, feeling as the warmth of  Rei’s fiery soul chased away the chill of her depression, and felt as Rei drew  strength from the certainty Kuno’s words had restored in herself.</p><p>
  But she did not notice the look Nabiki gave them  before she looked away.</p><p>
  “History says we win, Uc-chan,” the bunnygirl  whispered so softly that only she herself could hear.  “But does it say we will all survive?”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Akane and Shan Pu had barely made it back before the  lunch break ended, a little annoyed that the Phantom Sister, Cooan, had  escaped, but laughing about how Shan Pu had defeated the youma who apparently  had been long on muscle but very short on brains.  And Ranma had to laugh when they explained  that Rei’s grandfather had decided to open the female only combat aerobics  class because he had been rather put out to discover that he had been exposed  as a terrible flirt in a girl’s magazine that had arrived while Rei was away.  Since Rei was supposedly off on an ‘extended  field trip with friends from another school’, he’d been utterly without females  to bother now that the girls wouldn’t come to the shrine where a known hentai  lived.  While they still didn’t know what  the Phantom Sisters were doing or why, it seemed clear that it was intended to  maximize the negative emotional states in the locations they were  targeting.  They’d almost hypnotized the  entire class of women into killing each other.</p><p>
  They had discussed it for the few minutes left till  the bell rang then headed to their class, and found a surprise.</p><p>
  “Welcome back class.   Before we start, I wish to introduce a student who is transferring into  this homeroom,” the teacher said, gesturing to an attractive figure standing  next to his desk.  She looked vaguely  familiar to them, but her white bangs were hiding her face as she looked down  at her feet, and she appeared to have a pair of dog-like ears poking through  her hair, which were presently drooping, making her look almost afraid.  “Miss, please introduce yourself to the  class.”</p><p>
  The girl almost whispered her name, but Akane’s rabbit  ears shot straight up in shock.</p><p>
  “Miss, you have to speak louder please.”</p><p>
  She sighed heavily and her face lifted, eliciting a  gasp from the entire class. “My – my name is Kodachi Kuno.  I – I know most of you know me as I <em>was</em>.   The – The Black Rose is no more.   Please accept my apologies.  I  know my behavior has been inexcusable, but I pray that you can forgive the  madness with which I was afflicted.”</p><p>
  “Kodachi?!?”   Ranma blurted out.  “What the hell  happened to you?  When did you get  cursed?”</p><p>
  “I – I am not Jusenkyo cursed, Ranma-sama.  I – I am an inugami.  Since a very young child, I have dyed my hair  and hidden my ears.”</p><p>
  “An inugami?”</p><p>
  “She means she’s a dog spirit, Ranma-kun.”  Kyoko said from her corner, where she was  looking at Kodachi in admiration.  “Like  a kitsune or bakeneko.”</p><p>
  Kodachi nodded.   “Yes, Onamuri-san.  I – I was  asked by your cousin Ryune Minamoto to convey her greetings.”</p><p>
  Kyoko smiled.   “You met Ryu-chan?  Ooh, you must  tell me how she is doing later!”</p><p>
  Kodachi bowed to her than turned to where Akane and  Shan Pu were sitting, lowering herself to her knees before bowing  prostrate.  “I – I must also extend my  deepest apologies to Akane Tendo, and Shan Pu.   I cannot ask your forgiveness for my behavior, but Mousse-sama will be  here tomorrow and he will be disappointed with me if I have not expressed the  utter sorrow I feel for having behaved in so shameful and dishonorable a  fashion.  I have not acted in a manner  becoming for a warrior.”</p><p>
  Akane and Shan Pu both blinked, Shan Pu letting out a  soft ‘nyah’ in surprise.  “You know Mu  Si?”</p><p>
  Kodachi bowed her head, still prostrate.  “I must also beg that you please spare his  life, Shan Pu-sama, for my sake.  I could  not bear to see him suffer any more than he already does for having earned your  hatred.”</p><p>
  The cat girl blinked repeatedly.  “You – you want idiot Mu Si?”  She waved dismissively.  “You keep.   He dead Shan Pu.  Wish much  happiness and many children, myah.”</p><p>
  “Shan Pu!   That’s a little cold.”  Akane said  chidingly.</p><p>
  “You no know Mu Si, Akane-chan, nyah.  He good match Kodachi.  So long no chase Shan Pu, myah.”</p><p>
  “I think she loves him,” Ying-Ying said softly.  “It’s not very nice to tease her that way  about her love.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu looked shamed face.  She mewed sadly.  “You tell Mu Si, he behave, nyah, maybe Shan  Pu hear him again,” she said to the still bowing gymnast.</p><p>
  Kodachi rose to her hands and knees in shock, then  bowed rapidly to Shan Pu several times “Thank you, I will Shan Pu-sama.”</p><p>
  The teacher asked her to stand and go to her seat,  which was next to Kyoko, and as she did, Ranma leaned over and asked  softly.  “Who is that, and what did she  do with Kodachi?”</p><p>
  “She seems like a very nice person to me.” Konatsu  said.</p><p>
  Ying-Ying nodded.   “Yes.  I don’t know what it was,  but something happened to her, something traumatic.  I think she was serious when she said the  Black Rose was dead. Her aura isn’t <em>black </em>anymore.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu shrugged.   “It custom in Amazon village, myah.   In rare case, someone injured or go through very bad experience.  They like new person, nyah.  Sometimes is so great change, take new name,  and old name is placed on gravestone.   Maybe <em>is</em> new Kodachi, myuu?”</p><p>
  Konatsu was looking at where the gymnast was talking  quietly to Kyoko while the teacher was busy writing on the blackboard, and  Ying-Ying noted her eyes had shifted to green.   “Whoever she has become, she seems to be getting along well with the  kitsune there.”</p><p>
  “Kitsune?” Akane asked.</p><p>
  Ying-Ying laughed nervously.  “Oh you know Ko-chan, Akane-chan.  Kyoko-chan is just so cute and with the way  her hair pokes up, she does kind of look like she has fox ears.”</p><p>
  Clove took the hint and Konatsu’s eyes shifted back to  brown as the kunoichi nodded.   “Kyoko-chan would look so <em>kawaii</em> with fox ears!”</p><p>
  She said it a bit too loudly though, and the small  cheerleader looked startled as she looked at Konatsu and blinked, blushing  furiously while Kodachi’s face looked mortified.</p><p>
  “She probably would indeed, Kenzan-san.”  The teacher said to the class as he  turned.  “However, the subject of this  period’s lesson is on page…”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>“The whole class knows I’m a fox!” Kyoko wailed, her  ears quivering as her tail lashed back and forth furiously.</p><p>
  “Calm down, Kyoko.   All she said was you’d look cute in fox ears, a statement that just  happens to be absolutely true.” Kaede said earnestly.  “You’re incredibly kawaii in your true form,  but Ai could come in any minute!”</p><p>
  “She twisted her ankle in gym.” Megumi said as she  poked her head into the changing room.   “She’s not going to make practice today.   She’s getting it looked at over at Tofu’s clinic.”</p><p>
  Ayeka sighed.   “No point to practice <em>without</em> her.  So have you heard the latest?”</p><p>
  Megumi shook her head.</p><p>
  “Kodachi Kuno came back to school today.  In her true form.” Kaede supplied as she  stretched, then took off her sweater and blouse and undid her bra.  She groaned as her wings spread to touch the  walls.  “Kami!  It feels so good to let my wings out!”</p><p>
  “Mmhumm.  I  think you just use it for an excuse to show off the size of your chest.”  Ayeka said.   “However, Megumi, the succubus forgot to mention Kodachi is an inugami.  She’s running around with dog ears fully  visible, and her hair is apparently white as snow.”</p><p>
  “A white haired inugami?  What, is she aping Inuyasha?”</p><p>
  “No, no, no, Megumi.   Don’t you know?  The Kuno’s <em>ARE</em> Inuyasha’s descendants.” Kyoko said  excitedly, her tail wagging and her anxiety forgotten.  “Why do you think I let Kuno chase me?  Kodachi told me she’s been hiding her ears  because her mother made her.  Oh, and  she’s not full inugami, she’s half succubus.”</p><p>
  “<em>WHAT!</em>” the  succubus in the room blinked.</p><p>
  The kitsune nodded at Kaede.  “Her mom was a succubus.  Kodachi said she was an evil one though, a  Chaosian.”</p><p>
  “How the hell did the Youkai Council let a Chaosian  get her hands on the family of Inuyasha?” Ayeka said in shock.  “My uncle was a Chaosian, and my god, was he  a fiend!  He must have killed two or  three hundred people before the Hunters got him.”</p><p>
  “Kodachi didn’t know.   She told me she only found out about youkai when she met my cousin  Ryu-chan.  She knows I’m a kitsune  because Ryu-chan told her.”  </p><p>
  “Just great.” Kaede muttered.  “It’s bad enough I got to put up with  Miyaki-onee-chan, but now there’s another one of us here.”</p><p>
  “At least your sister just collects artists,” Megumi  said.  “I know she’s a pain when she  parades her entourage around, and teases you about having too small a harem,  but at least it’s nice spending cash when we model for her.”  She sighed.   “But it’s annoying that Kodachi is allowed to be in her true form.  Only reason I can think she’s getting away  with it is because she’s Principal Kuno’s daughter.  Same reason Tatewaki gets away with so much.”</p><p>
  Ayeka nodded as she scratched Kyoko between the  ears.  “By the way, I got what we need to  deal with Fei-san.  If she proves  difficult when we challenge her and Konatsu, I can seal her in this!”  She held up a small stoppered glass bottle  with a small set of charms around the lip, about the size of a sake jar.  “It’s a spirit trap.”</p><p>
  Megumi raised an eyebrow.  “Cool, where did you get it?”</p><p>
  “Same place Ai got the dragon wine.  Didn’t even have to spend cash.  I traded an ounce of my blood for it.  The owner’s making a longevity potion.”</p><p>
  “Is that safe?”</p><p>
  “Oh, he’s a registered fox mage.  Mom sent me to him actually.  She couldn’t even be bothered to ask why I  wanted a spirit trap.  She was too busy  planning the fundraiser for the bloodbank.”   Her finger trailed wistfully down the vein in Kyoko’s throat.  The kitsune blinked, then smiled and tilted  her head to the side as she swept her hair out of the way.  “Oooh!   Really?” Ayeka cooed.</p><p>
  Kyoko giggled.   “You have to get back your lost blood, right?”</p><p>
  Megumi laughed.   “You realize, she’s going to be blissed out for an hour at least if you  offer your throat.”</p><p>
  Kyoko smiled as she pulled Ayeka’s head down to her  neck.  “But it feels <em>soooo</em> good!”</p><p>
  Kaede laughed.   “What the heck, go for it Ayeka.   Not like we’re having practice today anyway.”  She looked at Megumi.  “So, heads or tails on the soon to be wildly  orgasmic fox?”</p><p>
  Megumi laughed.   “Flip for it?”</p><p>
  “Okay, but use a real coin this time.  No more double tailed ice coins.”</p><p>
  Kyoko’s laughter changed to an ecstatic moan as  Ayeka’s lips closed on her throat…</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Mara was better at shape changes, so she won the  argument with Urd.  Besides, as a former  demoness, she was much better at acting, even if she did say so herself, and as  a goddess, third class, she technically could get away with fudging the truth.</p><p>
  When Ai came limping into the clinic, she was bent  over behind the counter pretending to be picking up a bunch of fallen folders,  and besides the nurse’s uniform, she was sporting fox ears, and nine full fox  tails, she and Urd having decided that a kitsune was the least threatening of  Ai’s four infatuated youkai followers.</p><p>
  Ai blinked at the profusion of tails waving in the air  as Mara shuffled the folders into a pile, waiting patiently until the head  cheerleader finally called “Um… Hello?”</p><p>
  “<em>WAAAA!</em>”  Mara yelped, and winced as she deliberately  banged her head on the underside of the desk to knock her nurses hat askew and  make sure her ears were visible.  She  stood and rubbed the back of her head.   “Owwwwww.”  </p><p>
  Then she blinked, appeared to remember the customer  and turned to face Ai.  “Oh!  Hi!   I’m <em>sooo</em> sorry.  I’m Mara-chan! I didn’t hear you come in.”  she said in her best disturbingly chirpy airline stewardess voice.</p><p>
  “Umm, I’m here to see Doctor Tofu.  I sprained my ankle.”</p><p>
  “Oh, Tofu-sama isn’t here right now!” Mara said with a  disappointed sigh.  “He had to make a  housecall.”  </p><p>
  It was true, Kasumi had called him away less than ten  minutes ago to go check on the Phantom Sister that the Senshi had caught and  that Phoenixmoon had said Lo Shen had freed from some sort of control  spell.  The computer program had been  puzzled, saying he had been unable to determine exactly what had happened when  the Amazon Loremistress had taken Konatsu, Ying-Ying, and Ami into the young  woman’s psyche.   He had grumbled about  it like a voyeur who had suddenly found his peephole sealed up.</p><p>
  Ai nodded.  “I  guess I can wait.”</p><p>
  “Oh no, I’m qualified to handle minor injuries!”  Mara said brightly, wagging her tails and  sending paperwork flying everywhere.  Ai  blinked and tilted her head to look at Mara’s tails.</p><p>
  Mara acted puzzled, and slowly turned to look at what  Ai was looking at.  “Oh no!  My tails!”   She hurriedly pulled down the back of her skirt, the mass of tails  resisting the effort mightily.  “Um… I  don’t suppose you’d believe I’m a cosplayer?” she asked hopefully.</p><p>
  Ai shook her head.   “Cute tails though.”</p><p>
  Mara blushed.   “Um… well…”</p><p>
  Ai laughed.   “Don’t worry about it, Nurse-chan.   I’m used to weird stuff around Nerima.”</p><p>
  “You – you don’t think I’m scary?”</p><p>
  Ai shook her head.   “If I wasn’t limping, I’d probably be chasing you around that desk.”</p><p>
  “You don’t mind I’m a youkai?”</p><p>
  Ai blinked.   “Youkai?”</p><p>
  Mara nodded.  “I  – I’m a fox spirit.  I know I’m not  supposed to show my true form in front of humans, but I have a terrible time  remembering when I get distracted!”  Mara  quivered her lower lip.  “Oh, now the  youkai hunters are going to be after me!   I’ve broken the Accord!”</p><p>
  Ai waved her hands at her.  “Calm down, calm down.  I’m not scared, and I don’t care that you’re  a youkai or whatever.  I just need to get  my ankle looked at and wrapped.”</p><p>
  “You – you don’t mind that I’m not human?”</p><p>
  Ai shrugged.  “I  go to school with three rabbit girls, a dragon half, and a guy who changes back  and forth between male and female.  I  really don’t think a cute kitsune like you is a <em>scary</em> <em>monster</em>.”</p><p>
  “You’re really nice for a human!”  She slid aside the door to the examination  room.  “This way please.”</p><p>
  “Okay, and I’ll even promise you I won’t eat you.”</p><p>
  Mara giggled.   “But humans don’t eat youkai!”</p><p>
  “Nurse-chan, if I thought I could get you out of that  uniform, I’d certainly make an effort to lick you to death.”</p><p>
  Mara blushed for real this time.  “Ooh, you <em>are</em> a naughty one aren’t you?”</p><p>
  Ai laughed as she sat on the table and let Mara lift  her ankle and start unwrapping it.  “I am  a very naughty girl, Nurse-chan.  Maybe  after you wrap my ankle you can spank me.”</p><p>
  Mara giggled.   “I’m happily involved, but you’re sweet to offer.”  Her tails wagged again.</p><p>
  “You might want to watch those.  You’re already going to have to clean up in  front.”</p><p>
  Mara giggled again, and sparkled as she let the  shapechange lapse and resumed her normal form, still in the nurse’s  uniform.  “There.  You really aren’t scared of me?”</p><p>
  “Wow, you really <em>aren’t </em>cursed are you?  I thought you  probably had one of those Jusenkyo curses. But you did that without any water.”</p><p>
  “Oh, no, I’m a Ninetailed Fox.  Mara Onamuri.   I thought I told you I was a kitsune.”</p><p>
  Ai blinked.   “Are you related to Kyoko Onamuri?   She’s one of my cheerleaders.”</p><p>
  Mara shook her head.   “I have no clue, but the Onamuri kitsune clan is a really big one.  I have thousands of fox relatives.  And we’re related to the Minamotos, who are  kitsune nobility!  Haven’t you heard the  tale of the golden haired nine tailed fox?”</p><p>
  “You mean the one about the fox who advised the  emperor, Tamamo-no-Mae?”</p><p>
  Mara nodded.   “Yep.  She runs an inn up in the  mountains these days.  I think we’re  distantly related.  My aunt says I look a  little like her.”  She opened a cabinet  to retrieve Belldandy’s ointment and knelt to apply it to Ai’s ankle.  The rapid healing would make up for  deliberately having tripped up the cheerleader to get her to the doctor’s  office.  “We kitsune have a long and  distinguished history in Japan.  I even  graduated from the Kitsune Academy as a senior rank ten!”</p><p>
  Ai chuckled.  “I  always thought kitsune were just stories.   I wonder if Kyoko is a kitsune too.”</p><p>
  Mara smiled, her face hidden.  “If she’s an Onamuri, probably.  But you have to be careful.  We youkai have to live by the Accord; we’re not  supposed to reveal ourselves to humans.   It’s the law.”</p><p>
  “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned these  Accords.  What are you talking about?”</p><p>
  “Well, several hundred years ago, the youkai used to  prey on humans, but there was this powerful youkai, well half-youkai, and a  human miko who married one another. The hanyo and miko got all the youkai to  join together and make a treaty with the humans.  Since we could assume human form, we would  coexist with humans, and it eventually was established that the best way to  continue doing this once the Shogunate took over was to simply let humans  forget that youkai lived among them, because otherwise the various military  dictators might try to use us to make an army or whatnot.”  </p><p>
  Ai nodded.  “I  can see that.”</p><p>
  “So it’s the law that we can’t reveal ourselves to  humans.  If you’re not upset, it’s not  going to be a problem, but it’s always dangerous for a youkai to reveal her  secret, because she might scare a human, or risk being hunted, or just cause  someone a lot of heartbreak.  It’s hard  for a human and a youkai to love one another, because there are so many  differences between our races.  We’ve got  hearts and feelings just like humans, but our powers can be really scary.”  </p><p>
  Ai smiled.  “I  really don’t think you’re scary, Nurse-chan.   Terribly cute, but not scary.”</p><p>
  “Some of us can be, but any youkai living among humans  has sworn to follow the Accord though.   We swear to never use our powers against a human, unless that human is  equally powerful, like a mage or a devil hunter.  And for those few predator species that have  to feed on humans occasionally, like the vampires, or the various races that  feed off of emotional energies, they are magically bound to never do so from an  unwilling human, and they can never feed enough to cause harm.  Only those who do not follow the Accord will  kill, but sadly, those are the ones who get all the bad press for the rest of  us.”</p><p>
  Ai blinked.   “You mean all those stories about monsters are real?”</p><p>
  Mara nodded.   “But we’re not evil! At least not the majority of us!  We want to live and love, like humans.  We’re just <em>different.</em>”</p><p>
  Ai chuckled.   “Well <em>you</em> are certainly not  evil, Nurse-chan.  And if my little Kyoko  is a kitsune too, she’s certainly not evil either.  She’s the cutest one out of all of us.  Kaede likes to say <em>she</em> is, but Kyoko could sell sweets to a sugar factory.  Kaede is just too much pure sexiness to  really be <em>cute</em>.”</p><p>
  Mara chuckled.   “Sounds like you have yourself a little all girl harem there.”</p><p>
  Ai laughed.   “Maybe.  We <em>are </em>all lovers, but it’s just for fun.”</p><p>
  Mara gave her an eye as she finished wrapping the  cheerleader’s ankle.  “I wouldn’t be so  sure of that, dear.  Not if you’ve  actually had sex with her.  We kitsune  aren’t like wolves about mating for life, but we don’t give ourselves out of  anything but love.”</p><p>
  Ai blinked.   “Huh?”</p><p>
  “If your little Kyoko <em>is</em> a kitsune, and she has let you have her body, Ai-chan, then you  got her heart first, and forever.  And  for us youkai, forever can be just that.   We can live for as long as we want, unless we get killed.  It’s the same for a lot of animal  youkai.  We’re not like humans, because  so many of us have instincts we don’t really have control over.  For many species of us, if we give our  bodies, then you have already gotten our love.   You would never get one without both.”</p><p>
  Ai blinked again.   “But if that’s true, why wouldn’t she just <em>tell</em> me?”</p><p>
  “Human and youkai relationships end in tragedy as  often as human to human do, Ai-chan.  But  when a youkai loves a human, they risk <em>more</em> than just rejection, they risk their life as well, for there are always humans  who fear what is different.  I spent I  don’t know how many years pining for the love of my life, and it took nearly  dying for me to finally tell her I loved her.   All I can do now is look back on all those years and regret the time  lost when we could have been so happy, all because I was afraid.  Your Kyoko might just be too scared to tell  you her heart, because revealing her heart means revealing everything.  Especially since she already has so much of  you already, so she stands to lose that much more.”</p><p>
  Ai blinked, the corners of her eyes having acquired a  strange sparkle.  “I see.”</p><p>
  Mara smiled.   “Well, Ai-chan, your ankle will probably be fine by morning, just keep  it wrapped up tonight and don’t let the wrappings get soaked.”</p><p>
  Ai nodded, her mind very far away from Mara’s  words.   There was a ring from up front,  and Mara nodded to herself as she slid back the door.  Ai stepped out with her to see Urd picking up  the papers behind the desk, and the cheerleader blinked to see the gorgeous  woman smile at Mara.</p><p>
  “Mara-chan, did you knock everything flying again?”</p><p>
  Mara blushed, resuming her shapeshift as she shyly  looked at Urd.  “It was an accident!”</p><p>
  “Mara!”</p><p>
  “It’s okay, she knows I’m a kitsune.”</p><p>
  Urd chuckled.   “You make a really cute fox, Mara-chan.”</p><p>
  Mara stepped up to the white haired goddess and kissed  her.  “You’re laying it on thick, Urd my  love” she whispered.</p><p>
  “So are you.” Urd whispered back.</p><p>
  They turned to see Ai chuckling.  “I can see why you turned me down  Mara-sama.”  She bowed.  “I’m pleased to meet you, and may I  compliment you both on your beauty.  I  remember seeing you at Club Nabiki the other night, and I’m glad I finally got  to meet you.”</p><p>
  Urd blushed.   “Thank you, you’re pretty good looking yourself.”</p><p>
  Ai smiled.   “Thank you for looking at my ankle, Nurse Mara.  And for the info.”</p><p>
  Mara wagged her tails, sending papers flying  again.  “Anytime, Ai-chan.  And remember, don’t let fear stop you like I  did.”</p><p>
  Ai chuckled as she turned to go, the soft noise  turning to full laughter as Urd called “Mara!   I just picked those up!”</p><p>
  As the door closed behind the cheerleader, Mara waved  her hand and the papers picked themselves up and stacked themselves  neatly.  </p><p>
  “I take it that went well?” Urd said with a soft  smile.</p><p>
  Mara nodded.   “It did indeed.”</p><p>
  “Cool.  Now, how  about we find a TV set so we can go have a little fun cosplay?”</p><p>
  “Ooooh.  Naughty  nurse?</p><p>
  “Naughty kitsune.   Those tails are just <em>too </em>cute.”</p><p>
  “That’s what <em>she</em> said.”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Ai wandered towards home, not really paying attention  to where she was going or noticing that the pain in her ankle was almost gone,  so deep in thought was she.</p><p>
  Was Kyoko a kitsune?   If what that Nurse had said was true, the answer to that question had  suddenly become immensely important to Ai.</p><p>
  Megumi had been so impersonal and cold when Ai had  first seen her and decided to add her to her little play group, and Ayeka had  been hot tempered and aggressive to an extreme.   Despite their beauty and wealth, neither had been popular at  school.  Megumi had shoved away every boy  who had tried to get close with her utter coldness to their advances and her  indifference to everything, and Ayeka’s uncertain temper had made her notorious  around school as a violent fight starter.  </p><p>
  Ai had been just starting high school following her  recovery from her miscarriage, angry and cynical about her parents, and lonely  with the loss of her first female love, Miyu.   She had at first sought their company because she had wanted to hurt her  parents, to proudly display her lewd behavior and unrepentant bisexuality, all  in an effort to get their attention through the embarrassment she caused  them.  She had certainly not been seeking <em>love</em>.  </p><p>
  Yet once she had begun breaking through Megumi’s icy  shell, and tempering Ayeka’s bloodthirsty rage, she had found a friendship that  had meant more to her than her revenge.</p><p>
  There had been problems of course, making them lovers  had required educating both of them not only in sex but in the difference  between sex for fun and friendship and her casual flings for variety.  They both knew Ai had been recovering from a  lost love, and unready to risk her heart again, and after a few rocky months as  they learned to work as a team and co-operate in everything from cheerleading  to helping Ai fulfill her sexual sweet tooth, they had all become the firmest  of friends.  Ayeka was a terrific  submissive, but despite her massive insecurity complex and her tendency to go  berserk with jealous rage anytime she felt threatened with losing Ai’s  attentions, Ai had never really thought of her as more than a playmate and best  friend, and while Megumi - so different from the ice maiden she had been once  she and Ayeka had learned to be lovers - had always been her main advisor and  tactician, she had always seemed so <em>content </em>to simply be Ai’s shadow.   </p><p>
  When they had become second years, and needed to  enlarge the squad, Ai had decided on Kyoko and Kaede for pretty much the same  reasons she had originally picked Megumi and Ayeka.  Kaede was the biggest flirt and heartbreaker  of the new class, and Kyoko, despite her sweet and cute demeanor, had a  reputation as a spoiled brat because she seemed to have more fun being chased  than in actually being caught.  They had  come from different middle schools, and between them they had nearly had the  boys of the school fighting in the halls before Ai had ended it by adding them  to her squad.</p><p>
  But if Kyoko was a kitsune, and the more Ai thought  about it, the more she was becoming convinced it was true, what would that do  to the squad?  Could she accept Kyoko’s  love without causing Ayeka’s overwhelming jealousy to flare, or hurting the  other girls?  Would it cause even <em>more</em> strife than her recent melancholy  was already causing among her best friends? </p><p>
  Because, even though it had been irritating her squad  that she hadn’t challenged Konatsu and Ying-Ying yet, despite the fact that  more and more of the school had been calling <em>them</em> the prettiest girls in Furinkan, despite the fact that even  the fanclubs and the webratings had been reporting a drop in the cheerleaders  popularity as sex symbols, Ai hadn’t been able to bring herself to the kind of  vain rage that had always fueled her challenges before.  She had thought talking to Ukyo and helping  that damn dragon girl make up with her had evened the score over the dragon  wine, but seeing the happiness on Zhu Shu’s face as she had danced in the hall  on the morning Ukyo had given her the iPod had struck her to the core.  </p><p>
  It was that same look she had thought she would never  again see on her own face.  The look she  had thought lost when Miyu had moved to Germany.</p><p>
  Talking to Ukyo had stirred up so many memories.  She had been thinking of Miyu a lot since  then, and even entertaining herself with finding pictures of Sailor Venus online  was starting to fail to keep her from dwelling on her lost love, and the days  of happiness she had felt just being loved…</p><p>
  She sat on a bench in a small park overlooking a  canal, and played over the words the kitsune nurse had said.  </p><p>
  <em>We kitsune aren’t like wolves about  mating for life, but we don’t give ourselves out of anything but love.</em></p><p>
  She really was starting to believe that Kyoko was a  fox, but was it because she <em>believed</em> it to be true, or was she <em>wanting</em> it  to be true, because she wanted so badly to be loved again, to feel that same  happiness that she had seen on the little dragon girl’s face?  She could care less whether Kyoko was human  or not, if the nurse was right and she loved Ai, if she truly <em>loved </em>her, then…</p><p>
  Then what?   Ayeka’s furious rage at Ai having found someone?  Kyoko demanding that she stop playing with  her other friends, and insisting that she sleep only with her?  The breakup of the friendships which had come  to mean more to her than even her life?   Could she accept Kyoko’s love without betraying the others for whom she  cared so much?</p><p>
  She had ruled her squad with an iron hand, overcome  their squabbles with each other with sheer force of will, and turned them into  a cohesive fighting force feared at every combat cheerleading tournament.  She had no doubt that her not showing up to  practice today had simply led to the four of them playing around, sharing their  bodies with each other as casually as they shared them with Ai.  It had built the trust and confidence between  them, just as Ai had hoped it would, and for all their vanity before the  school, she had never treated any of them as anything other than absolutely  equal before her.</p><p>
  But could she return Kyoko’s love <em>without </em>favoring her?  Could  she ask the tiny little fox girl out on dates, and to share personal time with  her without disrupting the balance she had worked so hard to create?</p><p>
  How could she <em>not</em>?</p><p>
  Because the nurse’s words had made one thing perfectly  clear to Ai.  She wanted Kyoko’s love to  be real, because she desperately wanted to return it, as wholly and completely  as she had loved Miyu.  </p><p>
  But the same was true for any of them.  They all had qualities she valued, little  quirks and personality flaws she found endearing, little sexual desires that  excited her.  From Ayeka’s submissiveness  and nibbling obsession, to Megumi’s overwhelming desires for cuddling close, or  Kaede’s sheer raw nymphomania, and even Kyoko’s fetish for oral sex, they all  met a need she desperately had to fill.   Not one of her little sweets of the week had ever been able to match the  pleasures she had from her squad, or meet her insatiable need for  companionship.  Only when she was with  her squad did the loneliness ever really go away.</p><p>
  And that was the heart of it.  As desperately as she <em>did</em> want to be loved, and would gladly accept Kyoko’s heart, she  needed <em>all </em>of them, and she was  terribly afraid of losing them.  She  didn’t want to <em>have</em> to choose, but  beyond knowing she had their friendship, and the pleasures of their bodies,  could she ask them all for their love as well?   Could she even admit to Kyoko that she suspected she wasn’t human?  And what would the others think if they found  out?</p><p>
  She held her head in her hands, her elbows on her  knees, her brain awhirl, and the fear so overwhelming she felt like her heart  was going to burst, while tears silently rolled down her cheeks to drop  unheeded to her skirt.</p><p>
  <em>Don’t let fear stop you like I did.</em></p><p>
  But how could she not?   It could all come apart, all vanish.   If she took the next step, the ground could crumble and she could fall  so terribly far into the dark and loneliness again, feel once more the howling  artic winds inside her soul.</p><p>
  Gods!  How could  Konatsu and Ying-Ying talk so casually of sharing Zhu Shu and Ukyo?  How could Ranma and Akane and Shan Pu not  constantly be at each others throats as they each tried to win one or another’s  sole affection?  All her life experience  had shown her the squabbling and fighting that always went when someone had  more than one suitor, the betrayals and broken hearts when someone won and  someone lost.  How many times had she had  to listen to her mother screaming at her father over his latest  infidelity?  How many times had she heard  them talk about only being together for the kids?  Yeah, Mariko got more attention and was their  darling little girl, but even she knew how little their parents loved one  another.  All because her father had been  a ladies man in college, chased by dozens of girls, and even when he had  married her mother, he had always had others desiring him.  </p><p>
  How could she ask <em>four</em> separate girls to love her?  How could  she even dare to hope that it would work?   That they would all love her as passionately as she wanted to love them?  There was nothing she could think of about  herself that would make her worthy of even Kyoko’s love, how could she possibly  hope to win all of them?</p><p>
  She was failing even at being their leader.  They had worked so hard to be the best, to be  the most popular, and she was letting them down as she dithered and let their  rivals go unchallenged.  </p><p>
  She sighed.   That at least she could do.   Whatever else, she could be the leader they wanted her to be, and  challenge the kunoichi.  Ayeka had told  her that morning she had a way to keep the ghost from interfering, and when her  squad had bested that damnably beautiful ninja girl, then the fanclub ratings  would go up again.  All she had to do was  find a time when she could be sure Ranma and his harem couldn’t interfere.  </p><p>
  And once she had been beaten, they’d take her to the  cheerleader’s room, and between Kyoko’s amazing massage skills to work out the  bruises and kinks of the fight, Megumi’s aromatherapy incense, Kaede’s almost  hypnotic dancing, and Ayeka’s incredible culinary skills, she had no doubt that  the kunoichi would become one more of the long string of opponents who had  given themselves more than willingly over to the ecstasies of her team.  Of all the girls they had challenged, only a  few had declined the final invitation to grace their bed, and over half of them  had begged to come back occasionally for seconds.  That was a record Ai prided herself on.  She may be ruthless and merciless in combat,  but losing to her team was its own reward, and it tended to turn bitter enemies  into devoted fans.</p><p>
  And when the only girl who they had yet to defeat came  back, and her lover told her of the fun that she could have if she only lost…  maybe she could finally redeem their status as queens of the school.</p><p>
  And maybe she could learn the dragon girl’s secret,  and finally find her own true loves…</p>
