XXX

THE HELLSING MANSION, AROUND MIDNIGHT...

Berttle and Bean Bandit decided to take a rest after wresting the engine 
from the wrecked Honda Civic in preparation for transferring it to the 
Australian Wild Geese&#39;s car, which was to act as his entry into the 
Commonwealth International Automotive Exposition and Show. Nearby, a 
small iced cooler filled with cans of ale sat as the two sat down and 
exchanged stories from their respective pasts.

After a few minutes of this, Kenneth Hedgley had made his way to the two 
from the mansion. &quot;So this is what you do in your spare time,&quot; he 
quipped happily. &quot;Mind if I join you?&quot;

&quot;Hey no worries mate,&quot; Berttle replied. &quot;Help yourself to a can.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t mind if I do.&quot; Kenneth obtained a can from the rapidly-melting 
ice, then opened it up. &quot;Been a little boring tonight since my daughter 
Moria took off with those two vampire girlfriends of hers.&quot;

&quot;Never thought that Rally would be the romantic type,&quot; Bean said, taking 
a sip from his ale. &quot;From all the time I knew her, the only interests 
she ever had centered around either guns or cars.&quot;

&quot;I believe she never thought she was the type either, mate,&quot; Berttle 
laughed.

Bean then looked at the Australian and asked, &quot;By the way, where did 
Rally and the others went to?&quot;

&quot;Some club called Arisugawa&#39;s Locket,&quot; Berttle replied. &quot;It appeared 
out-of-nowhere a few months back, so the Organization went to 
investigate it. The first attempt, though, didn&#39;t go the way anyone 
wanted; Captain Bernadotte and two others got the snot kicked out of 
them by a girl guarding the bar. That was when Rally and Seras went 
there.&quot;

&quot;And?&quot; Kenneth added.

Berttle sat himself up and added, &quot;And here&#39;s where it gets really crazy 
- the two of them run into another version of Rally there, only human - 
as well as an old acquaintance of Rally&#39;s. Seems this place is able to 
be at several places at once, don&#39;t ask me how, I don&#39;t want the 
headache. It was there the girls found out that everything&#39;s on the 
up-and-up. Ever since then, Rally and Seras had went there from whenever 
they have some free time... sometimes, though, they come back a day 
later.&quot;

&quot;I guess that&#39;s why Moria wanted so bad to go there,&quot; Kenneth said. 
&quot;From our phone conversations, she described how they would disappear 
whenever Sir Integra gives them free time. She had been pestering them 
for a while to take her to that place...&quot;

A FEW HOURS BEFORE...

&quot;...And whatever you do,&quot; Moria Hedgley said to her father as they made 
their way down the hallway, &quot;I don&#39;t want you to fret too much if I&#39;m 
gone for more than a day.&quot;

&quot;Moria dear, you&#39;re a big girl now,&quot; Kenneth objected, keeping pace with 
his daughter. &quot;I think I can get used to the fact of you being out for a 
few hours... or at least a day.&quot;

&quot;But whenever we&#39;re together, I know you have a bad habit of worrying 
about me,&quot; Moria added as she opened the front door.

&quot;Moria, I think that at least four hundred years of experience would&#39;ve 
taught me a few lessons about trusting someone I care about.&quot; He then 
noticed the troubled look on his daughter&#39;s face. &quot;Moria?&quot;

The young maid/werewolf paused for a bit. &quot;Four hundred years,&quot; she 
finally said. &quot;I&#39;m not certain I could adjust to living as long as you 
have.&quot;

Kenneth then embraced Moria from behind. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I mentioned that, 
Moria dear,&quot; he said. &quot;I realize you&#39;re still adjusting to the fact that 
you&#39;re a lycanthrope.&quot;

Moria returned the embrace. &quot;It&#39;s not the transformations I&#39;m worried 
about, Father. What I need is some practical experience in how to deal 
with living so long.&quot;

Kenneth nodded. &quot;Granted, I&#39;m not going to be around too much to teach 
you that. If you like, you can ask Alucard about that particular part.&quot; 
Moria groaned. &quot;I know he&#39;s not exactly a people person, but I&#39;ll ask 
him nicely to help you out in case you bring it up.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Moria then released herself and added, &quot;Father, are you 
still alright by me going to what appears to be a lesbian club?&quot;

&quot;Moria, for the most part of your life, I haven&#39;t been in it with you,&quot; 
Kenneth answered. &quot;Even if I was, I still have no say on how you live 
your life. All I ask that you use common sense while you&#39;re there and 
have a good time.&quot; Then as an afterthought, &quot;Oh, and have you got that 
money order I sent you earlier?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Father,&quot; Moria said, producing the document and showing her 
father. &quot;I plan to ask Rally if she can stop by my bank so that I can 
have this taken care of.&quot; Then looking Kenneth in the eye, she further 
added, &quot;By the way, how come you still give me these little gifts when 
you know I have a job now?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s for me to know... and you to find out,&quot; Kenneth said, kissing 
his daughter on the forehead.

At that moment, Irene &quot;Rally&quot; Vincent&#39;s Cobra rolled-up in front of the 
door. &quot;Moria,&quot; Rally called out, getting out of the car, &quot;are you ready 
yet? Even if you aren&#39;t, we still have plenty of time to get there.&quot;

&quot;Oh I&#39;m more than ready, Rally,&quot; Moria said, stepping into the back 
seat. &quot;Do you think you can stop by at my bank on the way so that I can 
get this money order I have taken care of?&quot; She showed the dusky vampire 
the money order.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Rally replied.

&quot;How much exactly IS that money order anyway?&quot; Seras Victoria, who was 
in the front passenger&#39;s seat, asked. Once she got herself settled 
inside the rear seat, Moria then showed the Draculina. When she saw what 
was written on the document, Seras&#39; eyes almost popped out. &quot;&pound;25,000?&quot; 
she gasped. &quot;How in the world did your father get that much money?&quot;

&quot;How should I know?&quot; the maid said. &quot;I would guess that Father had done 
quite a bit of investing during his over 400 years of life, though I&#39;m 
not sure how he was able to get past the Great Depression.&quot;

&quot;Well who cares how he made or kept the money, Moria, let&#39;s just get 
that thing banked and then we girls are going to have some fun!&quot; Rally 
replied, who then started the car. &quot;You&#39;ll love Juri and the others! Why 
who knows,&quot; she further chuckled, &quot;you might even meet some cute girl 
there and decide to take her to one of the upstairs rooms.&quot;

&quot;RALLY!?&quot; Moria gasped, aghast. &quot;BOTH OF YOU KNOW I&#39;M COMMITTED TO YOU!! 
WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU MAKE SUCH AN INSINUATION!?&quot;

&quot;Moria, me and Rally are vampires! We don&#39;t care if you have an 
occasional fling once in a while!&quot; Seras giggled.

&quot;It&#39;s... it&#39;s just so embarrassing, that&#39;s all,&quot; huffed Moria, blushing 
furiously. Rally and Seras just laughed as the Cobra sped out of the 
mansion grounds, with Kenneth waving as they left.

PRESENT TIME...

&quot;I tell you, mate,&quot; Berttle said after hearing Kenneth&#39;s story, &quot;I wish 
me own dad was as open-minded as you are a few years back.&quot; He then took 
a sip of his ale, but said nothing.

Bean and Kenneth, on the other hand, looked at each other, wondering 
what he meant. &quot;Would you like to talk about it?&quot; Kenneth asked, sensing 
a story.

The Australian looked at the two, shrugged and gave in. &quot;Why not?&quot; he 
began. &quot;I grew up at a small orchard in the Barossa Valley in the state 
of South Australia, near Nuriootpa. Me family grew lychees for the Asian 
market, but it was always a struggle, with all the cockys eating about a 
quarter of the crop.&quot;

&quot;Cockys?&quot; Bean asked.

&quot;Cockatoos, parrots,&quot; Kenneth put-in. Bean nodded.

&quot;Right-o,&quot; Berttle said. &quot;Anyway, I grew up there with me and me younger 
sister Anna. We gotten along quite famously, and we often amused 
ourselves by chasing the cockys away from the trees. We never had much 
money, but me family had a lot of fun.&quot; Berttle then sighed sadly and 
added, &quot;Then about my seventeenth year, Anna decided to bring her new 
love to meet the family - a girl. Mum, for her part, was quite surprised 
by it, but diplomatic about the whole thing. Dad, on the other hand, 
blew his stack and promptly threw Anna out of the house, saying that he 
wasn&#39;t going to have some freak living under his roof. She was only 
fifteen at the time.

&quot;Well, after Anna gathered her things and left, I tried to protest what 
he did but Dad wouldn&#39;t have anything of it. He even told me that I 
wasn&#39;t to ever think of Anna as family and forget about her even 
existing. To him, as long as I lived under HIS roof, then I was expected 
to live by HIS rules, no questions asked. Well, it was only a few short 
months later before I graduated and joined the Australian Army. On that 
day, I let-off at him on how badly he treated Anna, using quite a few 
words I now regret saying. I then stormed off, and I haven&#39;t been back 
since.&quot;

&quot;Brother,&quot; Bean grumbled as he drank his ale, &quot;that&#39;s &#39;family values&#39; 
for you. Did you hear anything about your sister afterward?&quot;

&quot;Glad you asked. Now here&#39;s the funny part,&quot; Berttle said. &quot;About two 
years after I left, I had gotten a letter from Anna. Seems that a month 
after my row with Dad, he reconsidered what had happened, blaming 
himself for causing all the trouble with me and her, but was too afraid 
to make the first move. It took Mum to make all the arrangements, and a 
month before I got the letter; she got Anna and Dad together. He told 
her that he was sorry about pitching her out the way he did and would 
she please come back. He even accepted Anna&#39;s girlfriend.&quot; Berttle then 
smiled, &quot;She said yes and the both of them have been there since.&quot;

&quot;Nice to hear that,&quot; Kenneth added. &quot;Have you tried to talk to your 
father since?&quot;

&quot;I keep trying,&quot; Berttle explained, &quot;but whenever I try to ring them up, 
I always loose me nerve.&quot; He laughed humorlessly, &quot;Crikey - I can face 
down a whole group of FREAKs and ghouls and I still get all sweaty 
trying to apologize to me own father.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t wait too long,&quot; said Kenneth, setting down his ale. &quot;Over my 
400 years, I&#39;ve seen a lot of families torn apart over less than what 
you went through - with many of them destroyed because of these minor 
misunderstandings.&quot;

There was a bout of silence between the three, broken only by the sound 
of a police siren off in the distance. Not liking it, Bean broken it up 
by saying, &quot;Hey let&#39;s not get all bummed-out here! Let&#39;s change the 
subject! We still got plenty of beer here and... hey, what&#39;s going on 
out there? Sounds like one big commotion out there!&quot;

All three men got up from their seats to see members of the Wild Geese 
rushing from their barracks - all of them armed! Driving into the 
compound, a Bentley pulled-up near the motor pool, and Dr. Trevelyan got 
out, obviously disheveled, as if he was roused out of bed.

While trying to comprehend the chaos unfolding, Berttle happened to see 
Pip Bernadotte, captain of the Wild Geese, rush out of the mansion with 
Walter C. Dolnez, both men escorting two men pushing a medical gurney 
from the house. &quot;Captain,&quot; the old butler said, &quot;make sure you have your 
men posted at their stations! Miss Victoria has informed me that they 
should be in the compound within the next thirty seconds!&quot; Indeed, the 
police siren that was heard earlier was getting louder by the second.

&quot;Captain!&quot; Berttle called-out, &quot;What the devil&#39;s going on?&quot;

Pip took notice of his subordinate. &quot;About time you got your act 
together, mon ami!&quot; he snapped. &quot;Sir Integra had gotten a call from 
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket, informing her about some occurrence zere! Mignonette 
told us zat...&quot; but before the one-eyed Frenchman could finish, Rally&#39;s 
Cobra squealed into the compound, the roof now sporting a blue temporary 
police beacon and a siren blaring from it. Both light and siren stopped 
as soon as the car crossed the gate, and it was a few seconds later that 
the car screeched to a halt.

As soon as the engine was shut-off, Rally quickly got out of the car, 
then leapt over the hood to the passenger&#39;s side and opened the door. 
&quot;That&#39;s okay, take it easy!&quot; she said anxiously, then yelled out, &quot;WOULD 
SOMEBODY GET THAT DAMNED GURNEY OVER HERE, MORIA&#39;S HURT!!&quot;

&quot;Dear god, no,&quot; Kenneth breathed, racing along with the others as Moria, 
her clothes torn and her upper right arm clearly bleeding, was gently 
led from the car by the two vampires to the waiting gurney.

&quot;Oh god... it hurts!&quot; Moria gasped as she laid down, her left arm 
clutching the wound on her right arm. &quot;Rally... Seras... don&#39;t leave 
me!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re here, Moria!&quot; the Draculina said.

It wasn&#39;t long before Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing made her 
way to the group as her personal physician began treating the wounded 
girl. &quot;I have gotten only the barest of facts from Miss Arisugawa! 
Rally, Seras, what the hell happened?&quot; However, she noticed that the 
dusky vampire&#39;s face had a look of extreme worry, so she did not press 
her friend further.

&quot;Sir Integra,&quot; Seras began, walking up to the Hellsing leader, &quot;the club 
was attacked! From what I&#39;ve been able to tell, it was some organization 
from one of the realms serviced by the club. I&#39;ve only been able to get 
a look at their badges - some group called S.H.I.E.L.D.. That&#39;s all I 
can gather at this moment!&quot;

&quot;Her upper arm has a single bullet wound!&quot; Dr. Trevelyan began, still 
examining Moria. &quot;I can&#39;t find an exit wound, so I can assume the 
round&#39;s still in her arm! I&#39;m going to have to operate as soon as 
possible, otherwise she could lose this arm!&quot;

&quot;No... Rally, please... AUUUGGGHHH!!&quot; Moria arched-up, a new spasm of 
pain hitting.

&quot;MORIA!&quot; Kenneth called-out, &quot;I CAN BE ABLE TO HELP YOU, BUT YOU&#39;RE 
GOING TO HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME!!&quot; Turning to Dr. Trevelyan, he added, &quot;I 
know a way to enable you to get the bullet out without cutting into her 
arm! If you&#39;ll just allow me, I might be able to help her!&quot;

Unsure, Dr. Trevelyan looked to Sir Integra. &quot;Trust him, Doctor,&quot; she 
said. &quot;I believe he may help.&quot; Still looking doubtful, the doctor 
nodded.

Looking at both Rally and Seras, he directed the two to opposite ends of 
the wounded girl. &quot;I want you two to hold her down! No matter what 
happens, do not release her until I say so!&quot; Reluctantly, the two 
gripped Moria, Rally on her shoulders and uninjured arm, and Seras 
holding her legs.

&quot;Okay Moria,&quot; Kenneth began, &quot;I want you to transform for me!&quot;

&quot;F-Father?&quot; Moria gasped, still in a fog of pain.

&quot;Just do it! Trust me!&quot; was all Kenneth said.

Nodding, Moria&#39;s eyes soon shifted from green to bluish-white. As her 
facial features changed to a more lupine appearance, silver-gray fur 
soon grew on her skin, as well as her musculature bulking up, which 
briefly caused her to flinch in pain. The gathered Wild Geese took note 
but did nothing, despite the surprised looks on their faces.

&quot;I did it,&quot; Moria said, fighting for breath.

&quot;Good,&quot; Kenneth reassured. &quot;Now, I want you to take your transformation 
to its limit! At the same time, I want you to flex your arm muscles and 
try to force the bullet from your arm! I know it will hurt greatly, but 
you have to trust me on this one, please!&quot;

Briefly, a look of panic came over Moria&#39;s furred face, then a look of 
trust came over it. &quot;Yes.&quot; Gritting her teeth, her features further 
changed, her body growing in size as it did, causing what was left of 
her clothes to tear themselves off. At the same time, her face lost all 
humanlike appearance, her body now taking upon the appearance of a 
bipedal wolf. Unable to speak in this new form, her screams quickly 
became snarls and growls, as both Rally and Seras struggled to keep her 
on the gurney.

During this, Alucard appeared next to Sir Integra. He said nothing, 
instead folding his arms as he saw Dr. Trevelyan begin to probe the 
wound for the bullet. Sir Integra noticed and looked at her servant. The 
face of the No-Life King was neutral, betraying nothing as he watched 
the scene unfolding.

All of a sudden, the doctor called out, &quot;I think I&#39;ve got the bullet! 
Hold her down! Miss Hedgley, this is going to hurt!&quot; Straining to 
maintain his grip on the offending projectile, Dr. Trevelyan gingerly 
pulled at it, Moria&#39;s growling becoming a painful howl. Finally, the 
bullet was removed, causing the young werewolf to yelp painfully, which 
then settled into agonized whining and whimpering.

&quot;You did it, Moria!&quot; Kenneth said, placing his hand against the muzzle 
of his daughter as a sheet was pulled over her body. Almost immedietly, 
her form slowly but perceptively reverted to its human appearance. With 
a nod, he indicated to Rally and Seras to release her.

As soon as everyone had moved away from her, Dr. Trevelyan began 
examining her arm - then drew back in surprise. &quot;Well I&#39;ll be,&quot; he 
breathed. &quot;The wound is already beginning to heal!&quot; He then carefully 
bandaged the wound as Sir Integra walked up to him.

&quot;Indeed it is,&quot; the Hellsing leader said, seeing the wound sealing 
itself even as the doctor was bandaging it. &quot;What is the prognosis, 
Doctor?&quot;

&quot;Well, given the rate of healing,&quot; he began, &quot;I would say she should be 
completely healed within three days, give or take a few hours.&quot; Looking 
at Moria, he added, &quot;It might be still sore in-between that, but you 
should be able to resume your normal duties in a few hours.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Doctor,&quot; Moria said wearily. &quot;If at all possible, I would 
like to go to my room to rest a bit.&quot;

&quot;Please allow me to carry you to your quarters, Miss Hedgley,&quot; Alucard 
offered, picking Moria up and taking care not to let the sheet slip.

&quot;You better mind your manners while doing that,&quot; the maid cautioned.

&quot;Oh I will be a perfect gentleman in this case,&quot; the No-Life King 
purred, settling his load.

&quot;All the same, Master,&quot; Seras added, &quot;I had better accompany you, just 
to make sure.&quot; Not objecting, Alucard walked back to the mansion with 
his charges.

Rally, in the meantime, walked over to the Cobra and wearily looked over 
at the seat Moria was sitting in. There were blood stains on the seat, 
not to mention on the carpet as well. Quietly, Kenneth and Bean walked 
up to her, with Kenneth placing a gentle hand on her shoulder. &quot;You did 
good,&quot; he said, patting it. &quot;Thank you for getting my Moria back home.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rally mumbled, not sounding convinced. &quot;I wish I could&#39;ve 
anticipated this mess, though. Then maybe Moria didn&#39;t have to get 
hurt.&quot; Then noticing Sir Integra, she decided to elaborate on what her 
master had told her already. &quot;Whoever those S.H.I.E.L.D. bastards were, 
they were good. Seems like they had experience handling paranormal 
beings before, if the way they handled Ryoko, Minagi and Cybersix was 
any indication. Thankfully, the other patrons were able to pick-up the 
slack and were able to defend the club.&quot; She smiled as she turned to 
Kenneth and added, &quot;You really should be proud of Moria. She was able to 
handle herself well during the whole thing. Funny thing about her wound, 
though, she wasn&#39;t even the real target; the jerks were aiming for Keiko 
and Moria gotten hit with the ricochet. But when she did get hit, it 
really pissed her off. She transformed into her mid-level form and was 
able to take-out without killing three of the goons before they decided 
that the better part of valor was to beat a hasty retreat out of the 
club. Still, I wish I knew about this beforehand and prevented all this 
mess.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I don&#39;t think even vampires can anticipate the future, Rally,&quot; 
Bean said, patting his friend&#39;s shoulder. &quot;If you like, I can clean-out 
the blood from the car.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Bean.&quot;

&quot;From what you&#39;ve described,&quot; Kenneth added, &quot;this would explain why 
Moria&#39;s clothing was ripped. Remarkable.&quot;

&quot;What I find remarkable,&quot; Sir Integra added, looking at Rally, &quot;is you 
and Seras&#39; restraint as you were driving Moria back here. I would 
imagine the smell of her warm blood was enticing to the both of you.&quot;

&quot;Yeah it was,&quot; Rally murmured. &quot;However, neither myself, nor Master, had 
the nerve to dive in and stop it.&quot;

&quot;It would have complicated Dr. Trevelyan&#39;s efforts in removing the 
bullet otherwise,&quot; Sir Integra said, smiling. &quot;Miss Arisugawa has 
assured me that, as soon as more details are known, she will inform me 
about what has transpired this night, as well as Keiko&#39;s condition.&quot; 
Placing her hand in Kenneth&#39;s place, she added, &quot;I am sorry that you, 
Seras and Moria&#39;s night was spoiled because of this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Integra.&quot; Handing Bean her car keys, she stretched and said, 
&quot;Now if you&#39;ll all excuse me, I better get myself to my room.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take care of your upholstery in the meantime,&quot; Bean said, then 
turning to Berttle, he added, &quot;Care to help?&quot;

It took a while for the Australian to answer. &quot;Yes... but I&#39;ve got 
something to do first.&quot;

&quot;Like what?&quot; the courier asked.

Smiling, Berttle replied, &quot;Like calling home and talking to me father. 
Don&#39;t want to wait too long to take care of it, you know.&quot; Both Kenneth 
and Bean nodded knowingly.

THE SUB-BASEMENT LEVELS...

As soon as they entered the quarters that Rally, Seras and Moria shared, 
Alucard gently laid the maid on the coffin/bed. &quot;There, safe and not 
accosted,&quot; the No-Life King said, smiling.

&quot;Thank you, Alucard,&quot; Moria said.

&quot;You must know,&quot; Alucard added, &quot;that your father did not take 
instructing you to assume your final form lightly. It was the only way 
your healing powers could be fully realized.&quot;

&quot;My final form?&quot; gasped Moria, realizing the gravity of what had 
happened. &quot;Are you certain of that?&quot;

Alucard did not answer, instead turning to Seras and said, &quot;I believe is 
should leave the two of you alone. Until the next night.&quot; He then faded 
from view.

Not long afterward, Seras had gotten herself undressed and laid down 
beside Moria, who was gingerly maneuvering herself on the bed. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry this night was a wash, Moria,&quot; the Draculina began.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Moria replied. &quot;Nobody there knew there were 
going to be a bunch of armed crashers stirring-up trouble. As a 
matter-of-fact, I&#39;m looking forward to returning, only without the 
guns.&quot; She was quiet for a time before, &quot;What disturbs me is that form I 
had to assume to heal myself... so savage and primal. I sincerely hope I 
do not have to use that form too much in the future.&quot; She shivered at 
the thought.

&quot;Oh I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about it, Moria,&quot; Seras said, carefully 
embracing the maid. &quot;I imagine with time, you will be able to maintain 
control over it. What me and Rally are really thankful for is that you 
are alright.&quot; She then pulled Moria closer and the two found themselves 
in a passionate embrace, kissing deeply.

It was only a few minutes afterward which Rally had silently returned to 
the quarters, just to see her two lovers, both nude and groping each 
other furiously. After a few minutes of watching, she then quipped 
slyly, &quot;Interrupting anything?&quot;

Both vampire and werewolf jump hearing Rally&#39;s words. &quot;R-Rally,&quot; Seras 
stammered, trying to compose herself, &quot;I didn&#39;t expect you to enter so 
soon.&quot;

&quot;Y-you&#39;re not angry with us?&quot; Moria whimpered hopefully.

&quot;Now take it easy, you guys,&quot; the dusky vampire laughed as she used her 
powers to cause her clothing to drop to the stone floor, &quot;I don&#39;t care 
if you get it on without me.&quot; Rally then sided her nude body next to 
Moria, opposite of Seras. &quot;I just didn&#39;t expect it so soon.&quot;

&quot;Well you just surprised us, that&#39;s all,&quot; Moria sighed, then winced as 
Rally bumped into her injured arm. &quot;Ouch! Please watch it!&quot;

&quot;Sorry, Moria,&quot; Rally apologized. &quot;Guess that&#39;s going to be quite 
sensitive for a few days.&quot;

The lycanthrope maid sighed discouragily. &quot;I guess that sex is out of 
the question tonight,&quot; she glumly said.

At that point, Rally and Seras looked at each other, then both of them 
smiled slyly. &quot;Oh I really don&#39;t know about that, Moria,&quot; the Draculina 
lustily said as she maneuvered behind the brunette.

&quot;Seras, what are you... AHHHH!!&quot; Moria was caught off-guard as Seras 
grasped both breasts and began squeezing and massaging them.

&quot;What we&#39;re doing, Moria?&quot; Rally added as she spread Moria&#39;s legs. 
&quot;Well... call it &#39;pain relief&#39;.&quot; She then began to furiously lick the 
maid&#39;s folds.

Moria gasped in surprise and delight, Rally&#39;s cold, wet tongue raising 
powerful sensations through her loins. &quot;My goodness... Rally... 
NGAAAAHHH!!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re enjoying what we&#39;re doing, I see,&quot; Rally smirked slyly, resuming 
her ministrations to the maid.

For the better part of a minute, Moria writhed in ecstasy, Rally licking 
her while Seras both fondled her large breasts while kissing the back of 
her neck delicately. Then her eyes shifted color, going from green to 
bluish-white. At the same time, fangs grew within the maid&#39;s mouth, 
giving Moria an almost fearsome look. &quot;Rally,&quot; she gasped, &quot;please... 
treat me like you did during our first night... I beg of you!&quot;

Surprised, Rally complied, elongating her tongue within Moira&#39;s slit 
until it penetrated the very core of the maid&#39;s being. Fighting the urge 
to climax, Moria mentally fought it for an additional thirty seconds 
before finally giving in, her orgasm flooding Rally&#39;s face as she did. 
At the same time, she howled her pleasure, arching her back for the 
better part of five seconds before it ended. She then sagged against 
Seras&#39; body, panting and gasping - but with a smile on her face.

Dreamily, she managed to look at Rally, her face wet from Moria&#39;s 
secretions, and said, &quot;Thank you, Rally.&quot; She then noticed that the pain 
in her right arm was lessened. &quot;Now that&#39;s odd. I can hardly feel any 
pain.&quot;

&quot;Well that&#39;s endorphins for you,&quot; Rally giggled, crawling up Moria&#39;s 
body. &quot;You&#39;re still mortal, which means your body still responds 
normally to sex. When you came, your body released endorphins, Mother 
Nature&#39;s own pain killers.&quot; Rally&#39;s smile then faltered, adding further, 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry you got hurt, Moria. With your discovery that you&#39;re a 
werewolf, I was hoping we could help you forget about it for a night.&quot; 
But then Rally jumped as Moria caressed her cheek.

&quot;It&#39;s alright, Rally,&quot; the maid said, kissing her delicately. &quot;Not even 
a vampire can look into the future. It was just my bad luck, that&#39;s 
all.&quot; Moria then added slyly, &quot;In fact, I&#39;m looking forward to returning 
to the Locket, without the hoodlums of course.&quot; Her tone, however, 
became serious as she said, &quot;Rally, you and Seras lately have been 
treating me like a china doll, all because you believed me to be human. 
I&#39;m not that fragile now, so both of you don&#39;t have to worry about 
breaking me while making love.&quot;

Both Rally and Seras looked at each other, then smiled. &quot;Thanks for 
telling us that, Moria,&quot; the dusky vampire said.

&quot;I appreciate that,&quot; Moria replied, then braced stiffly. &quot;I think my arm 
is acting-up again, so I was wondering... could Seras...&quot;

&quot;Oh I believe I can be up to the task,&quot; the Draculina purred as she 
crawled between Moria&#39;s legs and began servicing her. Rally, in the 
meantime, done the same as she began licking her master&#39;s quim. With 
nothing to do, and noticing Rally was otherwise busied, she decided to 
do the same. It was strange to the maid, this &#39;daisy chain&#39; all three 
both engaged with - but Moria didn&#39;t care, just so long as she was with 
the women she loved.

UPSTAIRS, IN THE MOTOR POOL GARAGE...

The Cobra was settled inside the garage as Bean brought a few clean 
rags, a wet-dry vacuum cleaner and a bucket of soapy water to clean the 
blood stains from the passenger side. As he picked-up the brush, he 
noticed that Berttle had returned from his phone call and began putting 
away the tools and making sure the engine was secured on a stand. &quot;Quite 
an interesting night, isn&#39;t it?&quot; the courier said.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; the Geese said as he began cleaning the tools. Before Bean 
could say anything else, he added, &quot;Me dad was quite surprised I called. 
Didn&#39;t go into too much detail about what I was doing - but he did say I 
was glad I called.&quot;

Bean just nodded as he began to scrub away in the interior of Rally&#39;s 
car. Berttle then noticed that Pip had entered the garage and added, 
&quot;Captain, I noticed that Vic was nowhere near the compound when 
everything went down. Do you know where he was?&quot;

&quot;Oh him?&quot; the one-eyed Frenchman said. &quot;Oh from what I heard, he was 
taking ze night off. Maybe he&#39;s looking for a decent pub to hang-out 
at.&quot; Pip then smiled as he added, &quot;Well he better not be hung over in ze 
morning. We&#39;ve got a live-fire exercise to get done with ze rest of ze 
new men and he better score well.&quot;

&quot;You said it, Captain,&quot; Berttle laughed.

XXX

In a secluded corner of the estate, Vic looked around carefully as he 
set down his load and prepared to get busy. Finding a paper bag, he 
dumped-out two meter and a half lengths of wood, both five centimeters 
square. Then finding a hatchet he borrowed from a shed, he began to hewn 
the end of one of them into a point.

It wasn&#39;t easy to find lengths of white oak; Vic had to find a cabinet 
store that sold them in quantity. However, he scowled as he hacked the 
stick as he thought hatefully about Rally.
