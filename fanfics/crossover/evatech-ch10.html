<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 10 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/evatech-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>        &quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Asuka said as she circled around the lab.

        The Evangelion that she was looking at was a sleek black shape 
resting in it&#39;s testing cradle. The wings were swept back a bit more 
than standard, the entire form slimmer than the fighters Asuka was used 
to. Some weapons power had to be sacrificed for the upgrades in speed 
and maneuverability, but it was still a deadly little craft.

        &quot;The Stealth Evangelion,&quot; Gendo&#39;s eyes shone with his excitement 
as he loudly declared, &quot;it&#39;s my greatest creation!&quot; He waved his arms 
wildly as he explained, &quot;It&#39;s completely invisible to all known forms of 
scanner!&quot;

        &quot;Not bad at all,&quot; Asuka mused, then she froze suddenly.

        &quot;What?&quot; Gendo asked worriedly, knowing that she had spotted a 
problem. &#39;just like with my Armored Evangelion,&#39; he thought glumly.

        &quot;It&#39;s invisible to our sensors, too?&quot; Asuka asked him. As soon 
as she saw his nod she groaned, &quot;That means the SDF-1&#39;s weapons systems 
won&#39;t be able to tell if it&#39;s a friend or foe.&quot; At his blank look she 
continued, &quot;We could be shot down by our own guns.&quot;

        Gendo blinked at her a moment, digesting that piece of news. 
&quot;Back to the drawing board,&quot; he finally sighed, pushing his glasses up 
tiredly. He looked around his lad, white coat swirling around him. His 
voice was quiet as he asked, &quot;How&#39;s Shinji doing?&quot;

        &quot;Good,&quot; Asuka answered. She looked up at the older man in 
surprise and asked, &quot;Haven&#39;t you seen him lately?&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ve never been terribly comfortable around each other,&quot; Gendo 
finally admitted. &quot;I&#39;m glad he has you and Ayanami as friends,&quot; he said 
softly.

        Asuka wasn&#39;t quite sure if she should say this, but..., &quot;It&#39;s 
not just us. Shinji&#39;s even got a girlfriend, now.&quot;

        &quot;What?!&quot; Gendo ran over and grabbed her by the shoulders, 
grinning down at her happily, &quot;Thank god! I know my dear, departed wife 
Yui will be glad to know that Shinji&#39;s developing into a healthy, normal 
boy!&quot;

        &quot;If you don&#39;t let me go I&#39;m going to have to hurt you,&quot; Asuka 
warned him.

        &quot;Right,&quot; Gendo was instantly back to being the cool looking 
scientist. &quot;Thank you for the information,&quot; he waved as he moved off to 
go back to work.

        &#39;You know, I think he&#39;s actually getting crazier,&#39; Asuka shook 
her head as she slipped out of the Evangelion development lab and headed 
down the hall.

        &quot;Asuka,&quot; a unfamiliar female voice called out. Asuka turned to 
see a dark haired young woman jogging up the hall towards her, 
recognizing her after a moment as Maya. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Maya puffed, &quot;thanks 
for waiting.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s all right,&quot; Asuka replied. &quot;What can I do for you?&quot; she 
asked. Maya blushed cutely, and Asuka had an odd mental flash of Rei 
blushing that way.

        &quot;I wanted to thank you once again for forgiving me so easily 
when I shot you down,&quot; Maya said softly, the two walking towards the 
elevator.

        &quot;Nothing to forgive,&quot; Asuka said to her firmly, &quot;I know it 
wasn&#39;t your fault.&quot;

        &quot;So how are you settling back into being on duty?&quot; Maya asked 
curiously.

        &quot;Things have been pretty quiet,&quot; Asuka noted. &quot;We haven&#39;t seen 
an Angel for more than a week,&quot; she said with a soft sigh.

        &quot;You&#39;re worried?&quot; Maya blinked.

        &quot;I don&#39;t trust the enemy to continue to just quietly follow us,&quot; 
Asuka said with a shrug, &quot;they&#39;re up to something, I&#39;m sure of it.&quot;

        They stepped into the lift and Maya looked at Asuka, &quot;What level 
do you want?&quot; She entered the code for her then put the one for the 
bridge in. &quot;Asuka,&quot; she asked hesitantly, &quot;have you ever been in love 
before?&quot;

        Asuka was struck with the crystal clear image of those almost 
red eyes looking out at her caringly from Rei Ayanami&#39;s face. &quot;No, I 
haven&#39;t,&quot; she answered Maya, wondering why it almost felt like a lie 
saying that.

        Maya nodded slightly. &quot;There&#39;s someone I care for,&quot; she said, 
&quot;whom I love, and we&#39;re planing to do something to symbolize it.&quot;

        &quot;Lucky man,&quot; Asuka said, wondering why Maya was telling her 
this. Except for a few meetings before she was shot they barely knew 
each other.

        &quot;It&#39;s a woman, actually,&quot; Maya flashed a smile. She tilted her 
head to look up at the ceiling, &quot;But the closer we get, the more nervous 
I become....&quot;

        &quot;And she&#39;s probably feeling the exact same thing,&quot; Asuka said 
thoughtfully, &quot;the girl you love, I mean. If I was getting... married, 
or something like that, I&#39;d be scared out of my wits. It&#39;s only natural, 
I suppose.&quot;

        &quot;Really?&quot; Maya looked at her in surprise.

        &quot;It&#39;s a big step you&#39;re taking,&quot; Asuka shrugged. They reached 
her level and stepped out into the hallway, &quot;Talk to her about it, 
you&#39;ll both feel better.&quot;

        Maya nodded. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she called out as the elevator doors 
closed.

        &quot;Asuka Langley, marriage councilor,&quot; she muttered to herself, 
shaking her head. Asuka strode down the hall towards the ready room, 
moving through the press of pilots until she reached where her wingmates 
were waiting.

        &quot;Hey boss,&quot; Shinji gave her a grin. The brown haired young man 
held his flight helmet in his hands, the casual manner hiding a 
dangerous pilot.

        &quot;Asuka,&quot; Rei flashed one of her gentle smiles, the sort that she 
seemed to reserve for Asuka herself. She tilted her head to the side and 
asked, &quot;So how was your visit with our good Doctor Ikari?&quot;

        &quot;Not very helpful,&quot; Asuka said dryly. &quot;I like his idea for a 
Stealth Evangelion,&quot; she admitted as she sat down beside the other two, 
&quot;but not if it gets me shot down by our own guns.&quot; She paused for effect 
before adding, &quot;Again.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s my dad,&quot; Shinji shook his head with a sigh. He sat back 
and said, &quot;I&#39;ve never been sure if his exposure to robotechnology did 
that, or if he was odd to begin with.&quot; He looked over at Rei, &quot;No 
offense meant.&quot;

        &quot;None taken,&quot; Rei reassured him. She looked over at Asuka and 
asked, &quot;Do you think the enemy will attack soon?&quot;

        Asuka opened her mouth to answer when... a warning alarm cut 
across the room. &quot;Pilots to your aircraft,&quot; Ritsuko&#39;s clear voice 
ordered, &quot;enemy forces are on the move.&quot;

        &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Asuka jumped to her feet, leading the charge into 
the hanger. The three rushed to board their planes, Asuka patching 
herself into the bridge. &quot;Any Angel sightings?&quot; Asuka asked as she 
strapped herself into her seat.

        &quot;No Angels sighted yet,&quot; Ritsuko said crisply, &quot;but I&#39;ll pass on 
any sightings to your wing soonest. For now move to support any sectors 
under heavy attack.&quot;

        &quot;There&#39;s No Angels at all?&quot; Shinji echoed the information, 
sounding oddly disappointed about it, somehow.

        &quot;Hoping to run into your friend Miriya again?&quot; Rei suggested 
archly.

        &quot;No I was not,&quot; Shinji shot back.

        &quot;Less chatter,&quot; Asuka said, trying to sound stern despite her 
slight smile, &quot;more action, please. Let&#39;s get into the air before 
something else happens.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Shinji nodded sheepishly.

        &quot;Hai,&quot; Rei agreed.

        A few moments later Asuka&#39;s red trimmed Evangelion fighter 
rocketed out of the launch bay into the blue sky. On one side of her 
Shinji&#39;s blue trimmed Evangelion soared smoothly, on the other Rei in 
her infamous Skull One.

        &quot;Let&#39;s go kick some,&quot; Asuka commanded as they dove towards the 
first flight of battlepods. Still, in the back of her mind she wondered, 
&#39;Where are the Angels?&#39;</pre>
