<h1>Senshi Sabers (part 16 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/sensabers-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>Rei Hino scowled as she finished up her set, sweat
plastering her freshly cut short black hair to her
head. She and her band mates left the stage, the
singer practically simmering with nervous energy, and
with a determined stride Rei ducked into her changing
room to dress.

&#39;I can&#39;t believe she&#39;s still following me,&#39; Rei
thought with annoyance as she stripped off her skimpy
stage clothes and climbed into the slightly moldy old
shower. She thought of the pretty blonde police
officer and fought back a scowl as she turned on the
water taps, nearly howling in surprise as it gushed
ice cold.

&quot;That didn&#39;t sound good,&quot; the drummer noted from the
next room as he casually uncapped a beer and chugged
it down. The rest of her bandmates were sprawled
around the room, having nearly collapsed from keeping
up with their driven leader.

&quot;Boy has she been bitchy,&quot; the guitarist agreed with
that glumly, his messy hair falling in his eyes. He
reached out and caught a casually tossed beer as he
added, &quot;Wonder if it&#39;s &#39;cause she hasn&#39;t been getting
laid lately?&quot;

The keyboardist nearly choked on his drink, the lanky
man looking amused. &quot;Don&#39;t let her hear you say that,&quot;
he noted, &quot;or she&#39;ll kill you.&quot;

&quot;You can say that again,&quot; the drummer agreed.

&quot;Wish I could get the sort of action she&#39;s getting,&quot;
the keyboardist noted with a sigh, &quot;how many girls
have we seen around her lately?&quot;

&quot;Other than the usual groupies? Let&#39;s see...&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s the blue haired office lady,&quot; one noted.

&quot;That hot blonde police officer,&quot; he sighed, &quot;too bad
she&#39;s so butch.&quot;

&quot;And that pair of girls too,&quot; the third man mused, &quot;do
you think they&#39;re interested in recruiting Rei for a
threesome?&quot;

&quot;If they could bottle whatever the hell it is that Rei
has,&quot; the drummer groaned, &quot;I&#39;d buy it by the case
full, I swear.&quot;

Thankfully unaware that her sex life and potential
girlfriends were being speculated on next door Rei
stumbled out of the icy shower, shivering a bit as she
grabbed a towel and wiped herself off, trying to warm
her chilled bones. Once she was dry she pulled on her
riding leathers, the black synthetic leather clinging
to every curve as she zipped it up with a hiss.

Matching boots thumping on the floor as Rei left her
dressing room and hammered on the door beside it as
she yelled, &quot;You decent?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; her keyboardist called back, &quot;but come in
anyway.&quot;

Rei pushed the door open with a slight smile, feeling
faintly surprised when she noted all three men were
blushing. &#39;What the hell?&#39; she thought, wondering what
they might have been talking about. Dismissing that
thought Rei said briskly, &quot;I&#39;m taking off, so don&#39;t
get into shit. I&#39;m not bailing you all out of jail
again.&quot;

&quot;Hey, it only happened the one time,&quot; the drummer
protested, &quot;and the bartender lied about us starting
the fight.&quot;

&quot;Yeah right,&quot; Rei scoffed. She turned as she said
calmly, &quot;Catch you later.&quot; Heading out into the night
Rei pulled her coat on around her, climbing on her
cycle and starting it up, the rumble soft as she
hurried off into the darkness.

The next morning Setsuna Meiou strode into the Silky
Doll, the tall black haired woman scanning the shop a
moment as she searched for a single person. A smile
teased her lips as she saw Ami talking to a lovely
young woman, assisting her sort through panties,
eventually helping the lady find a daring thong that
she carried to a change room.

Ami looked up as she saw Setsuna walking up, the blue
haired young woman smiling slightly. &quot;Good morning,&quot;
she nodded.

&quot;I&#39;m surprised how calmly you do all this,&quot; Setsuna
looked around the store as Ami&#39;s employees Catsy and
Birdy helped other customers pick out lingerie and
other items, &quot;considering your usually shy nature.&quot;

&quot;It took some getting used to,&quot; Ami conceded. She kept
her expression neutral as she said, &quot;Thank you for
coming so soon.&quot;

&quot;After you forwarded me a copy of Tomoe&#39;s files I
almost had to,&quot; Setsuna said. A smile, &quot;Should I meet
you in the upper office?&quot;

Ami noticed a customer waving and put on her
professional smile. &quot;I hope I&#39;ll only be a few
minutes,&quot; she promised as she headed off.

Setsuna watched Ami skillfully pull the slightly
chunky woman away from a outfit that would have looked
horrid and towards a much more suitable item, then she
moved on. Nodding a greeting to Birdy Setsuna opened
the back door, revealing the stairs that lead to the
offices upstairs. There was an elevator available,
too, but she preferred the stairs.

&quot;Good morning Miss Meiou,&quot; Mercury said, the
computer&#39;s feminine voice matching the soothing
personality she had.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Setsuna agreed as she walked over to a
waiting coffee pot on the counter nearby, cookies and
other snacks waiting too.

&quot;Would you like me to update you on information
obtained from the Bio-boomer development files?&quot;
Mercury asked politely.

&quot;Just the high points,&quot; Setsuna stirred her coffee
then took a sip, &quot;I&#39;m sure Ami will want to go over
them with me, too.&quot;

&quot;Prof. Tomoe confessed in his files to killing Doctor
Mizuno,&quot; Mercury&#39;s voice was flat, &quot;as well as
stealing her project data on the Outers.&quot;

Setsuna sat on the couch with a thump. &quot;I just wish we
had been able to get this data years ago,&quot; she sighed,
&quot;we could have nailed Tomoe to the wall.&quot;

&quot;I cannot compute the probability of a conviction,&quot;
Mercury agreed, &quot;but Tomoe would certainly be charged
if the police knew.&quot;

Taking a long drink of her coffee Setsuna asked, &quot;Do
we know for certain that Tomoe knew about Uranus and
Neptune?&quot;

&quot;Confirmed,&quot; Mercury said, &quot;but he did not have the
data on their final appearance or full combat
capabilities. It may be because of that, that Infinity
couldn&#39;t find them.&quot;

&quot;Very probably,&quot; Setsuna got a cookie, being careful
not to get any crumbs on the couch. A few moments
later two very familiar voices were heard talking and
Setsuna sat up in surprise. &#39;What are they doing
here?&#39;

Ami Mizuno came in first, the blue haired young
woman&#39;s expression frankly murderous. Behind her came
Haruka and Michiru, the two ladies trying to look as
innocent as possible. &quot;Fancy meeting you here,&quot; Haruka
grinned endearingly, her sandy brown hair falling into
her eyes.

&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; Setsuna got up, long
black hair swinging, &quot;I expressly forbid you to stay
away from Ami or the Senshi Sabers!&quot;

&quot;I assume you told them where I was based?&quot; Ami asked,
putting her hands in the pockets of her stylish
business suit.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Setsuna conceded, &quot;and clearly it was a mistake
on my part.&quot;

&quot;Setsuna-san,&quot; Michiru was quietly respectful, &quot;you
can&#39;t protect us forever.&quot;

A light seemed to go on for Ami and she smiled
slightly. &#39;Of course,&#39; she realized, &#39;Setsuna&#39;s mind
is mostly patterned after my mother... and in a way
the mother of these two, too. No wonder she&#39;s
protective of them.&#39;

&quot;Besides,&quot; Haruka said, &quot;we&#39;ve already made contact
with one of the other Senshi.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; both Ami and Setsuna blurted.

&quot;Rei Hino,&quot; Michiru supplied, &quot;we went to one of her
concerts and got to talking...&quot;

Ami sighed, feeling a headache coming on. &quot;There&#39;s a
reason I&#39;ve discouraged you from meeting the Senshi,
and it&#39;s for your and our security,&quot; Ami sighed, &quot;I
may not be so concerned about Infinity but there are
quite a few people interested in you.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Haruka started when they heard another set of
footsteps.

&quot;Hey Ami, I was in the neighborhood and I wanted
to...&quot; Rei Hino started before blinking in surprise at
the two young ladies. &quot;You!&quot;

&quot;Rei, hello,&quot; Michiru bowed slightly, smiling.

&quot;I understand you already know each other,&quot; Ami
carefully masked her irritation at this development as
she lied, &quot;but Haruka and Michiru are Setsuna&#39;s
roommates. Apparently they followed her down here.&quot;

&quot;Really,&quot; Rei said coldly, getting the strong
impression that Ami was lying to her. With a flare of
irritation she said, &quot;I came down to talk to you, but
I can see you&#39;re busy.&quot; Turning she stomped from the
room, &quot;Good bye!&quot;

&quot;Well that could have gone better,&quot; Setsuna sighed
after the sound of the door slamming faded, feeling a
headache coming on.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Haruka sighed, running a hand through her
hair.

Ami locked the door this time then sat down with a
sigh, studying both young women. &quot;Are you certain you
want to help?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Ami,&quot; Setsuna sat up in surprise, looking with dismay
at Ami.

&quot;They&#39;re right that we can&#39;t easily protect them,&quot; Ami
told her, &quot;and with the way things are escalating I&#39;ll
need to call them in soon anyway.&quot;

&quot;Point,&quot; Setsuna admitted after a moment&#39;s thought,
but also clearly reluctant from the look on her face

&quot;We&#39;ll do everything we can to help,&quot; Michiru vowed as
Haruka nodded her agreement.

&quot;Then sit down and grab a coffee,&quot; Ami waved them over
to a seat, &quot;and let me tell you what we know about
Mistress Nine...&quot;</pre>
