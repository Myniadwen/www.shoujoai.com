<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/vexedfusion.html">Vexed Fusion</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/deepdown-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>&quot;The Big Bash&quot; 
 

      &quot;God damnit Rei, you have the nerve to invite us all the way out 
to a shindig and there ain&#39;t no sake or beer to greet us!!?&quot; 

      &quot;NO ONE invited you, Jadeite!  Take your damn lackey friends and 
GET THE HELL OFF OF MY PROPERTY!&quot; 

      Several heads turned in the direction of the raven haired teen 
that was currently shoving a small group of college guys towards the 
shrine&#39;s steps; some laughed and others shrugged, going back to previous 
conversations.  The birthday party began at around 5 pm, with only 12 
students from the school; but multiplied into over a hundred teenagers 
(and young adults) by the time 7:30 rolled around.  Upon seeing this, 
Rei quickly lost her head and began frantically running around with 
Haruka in an almost futile attempt to disperse the crowd quickly. 

      &quot;Damnit, who leaked about the party?&quot; 

      The tall blonde shrugged, &quot;Dunno, but I bet it was a certain curvy 
blonde with a red bow had something to do with it...&quot; 

      Lavender eyes burned with fury upon seeing a group of boys daring 
each other to climb the willow tree that donned all of the girl&#39;s 
prayers.  &quot;WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU&#39;RE DOING?!&quot; 

      One boy fell from the branch he&#39;d been hanging from as the others 
ran away; he scrambled upwards only to be pushed back down by Haruka.  
She grabbed him up by his collar, eyeing him suspiciously. 

      &quot;What kind of party do you think this is?&quot; 

      The boy squirmed underneath the runner&#39;s stony gaze, &quot;Uh... 
umm...&quot;  He began to weep softly, believing he was going to get pounded. 

      Haruka merely rolled her eyes at him, &quot;Just tell us why you&#39;re 
here.&quot; 

      He swallowed, trying to stop his crying, &quot;I-i-isn&#39;t this, the keg 
p-party?&quot;  His eyes widened fearfully as Rei came back from having 
chased the group off. 

      &quot;What the hell do you mean &#39;keg party&#39;?&quot;  Her lavender eyes were 
filled with venom as she stared at the teen. 

      &quot;W-w-well, that was what w-w-we were told... big bash at the 
Hikawa S-shrine... S-s-Sunday n-night...&quot; 

      &quot;Who told you?!&quot; 

      The teen merely shook his head, mumbling something about a friend 
of a friend.  The raven haired girl and the tall blonde shared a look 
before pushing the boy away, telling him to get off the property. 

      Sighing deeply, the racer brushed her wavy hair back as she spoke, 
&quot;So... someone spread false information... a prank?&quot; 

      Rei balled her fists in anger, clenching her teeth as she tried to 
steady herself, &quot;When I get my hands on that-...&quot;  She was cut off as a 
group of obviously drunk students came skipping by the two girls, 
singing loudly and spilling their drinks on innocent bystanders. 

      Haruka pinched the bridge of her nose in frustration before 
placing her hand on the lavender eyed girl&#39;s shoulder, &quot;I&#39;ll take care 
of them; you go check on Ami and the others, see how they&#39;re fairing.&quot; 

      Nodding, Rei stormed away, stopping to scream at the unwanted 
guests every so often as she made her way towards the building which 
safely sheltered the original invited guests, including her Ami-chan.  
They&#39;d all taken shelter there when the shrine became over-run with 
loud, rowdy teenagers; Rei and Haruka deciding to clear them out while 
the others stayed inside. 

      She flung open the door exasperatedly, charging inside and 
immediately looking around to see if anyone had had the gall to enter 
the home without permission.  After checking several rooms and being 
satisfied with the results, the raven haired girl made her way to the 
living room. 

      &quot;Jeeze Rei, we could hear you all the way in here... clearly.&quot;  
Lavender eyes found Minako on the floor leaning against Utena&#39;s legs, 
rolling her eyes and looking bored to tears. 

      The sexy teen stuck her tongue out at the blonde before moving to 
where Ami was currently sitting on the couch, fingering the binding of 
one of the books she&#39;d received for her birthday.  She knelt down, 
resting her hand on the blue haired girl&#39;s. 

      &quot;You okay, Ami-chan?&quot; 

      Baby blue eyes looked up and the girl smiled, &quot;Yes, I&#39;m fine.  I&#39;m 
sorry your party for me got ruined, though.&quot;  She frowned again, looking 
back down at the book. 

      &quot;It&#39;s not ruined completely, just yet.  If anyone can clear the 
grounds, I&#39;m sure Haruka and Rei can.  We&#39;ll get back to cake and ice 
cream before you know it,&quot; the aqua haired girl leaned over and patted 
Ami&#39;s shoulder consolingly. 

      From the corner of the room came a loud groan, accompanied by a 
grumbling stomach, &quot;We should eat the cake and ice cream NOW, so we can 
keep our strength up during this hard fight!&quot; 

      Minako grinned, &quot;What strength have you wasted, Usagi-hime?  Other 
than the strength you used to eat half the chocolates you gave to 
Ami-chan as a gift!&quot; 

      &quot;But Ami-chan doesn&#39;t mind!!  After all, aren&#39;t birthdays about 
giving?!&quot;  The meatball head blonde began to wail, causing the redhead 
to her right to sigh and put her arm around the crying girl. 

      &quot;I think you&#39;re confusing birthdays with Christmas, Usa-chan,&quot; 
everyone turned towards the blue haired girl, who was gazing adoringly 
at her bubbly friend.  Her smile seemed to radiate through the room. 

      Standing up, Rei spoke loudly, &quot;Alright then, Haruka and I will 
finish shifting the herd of drunkards off the property and then we&#39;ll 
end this party the right way!&quot; 

      Hands shot up in the air, everyone shouting encouragement as the 
raven haired girl charged out of the room, back outside to continue her 
yelling and threats.  Soon, the room became quiet again, well, almost 
quiet as Usagi was still grumbling about not getting enough to eat 
earlier and how low her blood sugar was.  The quiet lull was broken 
though, as everyone&#39;s ears perked up at the sound of the sexy teen&#39;s 
screaming. 

      Utena began to laugh loudly, covering her mouth quickly and 
drawing several pairs of eyes towards her.  She met those eyes, 
uncovering her mouth, &quot;You really can hear her clearly.&quot; 

      The room broke into fits of giggles much to the pink haired girl&#39;s 
delight.  She had this feeling that everyone was being far too uptight 
about the situation and wished to at least break the ice.  A soft, warm 
hand came to rest on the basketball players knee causing the girl to 
look down into a pair of sparkling blue eyes that could only belong to 
one person: Minako. 

      Feeling a slight blush creep up her neck, Utena searched her mind 
for any excuse to get away from temptation and stood up swiftly, being 
careful not to bump into the blonde.  She felt several pairs of eyes 
drawn towards her along with the confused teen at her feet. 

      &quot;Uh... nature calls,&quot; replied the pink haired girl sheepishly.  
She got as far as four steps when the voluptuous girl jumped up from the 
ground and was right behind her. 

      &quot;I don&#39;t need company to the bathroom Minako-chan!&quot; 

      It was too late as the blonde had already moved past her, the 
girls&#39; hands behind her head showing she&#39;d already made up her mind, 
&quot;You don&#39;t know what kind of idiots are lurking around this place, we&#39;re 
better to go every in pairs.&quot; 

      Slate blue eyes looked pleadingly towards the other girls in the 
room deciding on the logical Mizuno Ami.  &quot;Ami-chan, tell her she&#39;s 
being overly sensitive, right?&quot; 

      The blue haired girl half-smiled and half-grimaced, a sign Utena 
thought was not good, &quot;I think, due to the circumstances, she is right.  
We saw those guys out there, being that they&#39;re drunk, it&#39;s not safe to 
go anywhere alone, even if we&#39;re inside the shrine.&quot; 

      Sighing in defeat, the basketball player threw her hands up in the 
air and turned to meet the other girl&#39;s dazzling blue eyes looking at 
her ever so triumphantly.  If there was anything worse than a stubborn 
Minako, it was a stubborn Minako who just found out she&#39;s right in being 
so stubborn.  Utena closed her eyes, prepared to not bait the blonde 
into saying the dreaded &#39;I told you so&#39; which was sure to be followed by 
some sort of victory dance. 

      &quot;Alright, fine, let&#39;s go.&quot;  The pink haired girl felt safe with 
that sentence. 

      She opened her eyes to find the voluptuous teen bounding towards 
her, grinning happily and linking the two girl&#39;s arms together, 
&quot;Onwards!&quot; 

      Utena cried out as she felt her arm nearly pulled out of its 
socket, her legs finally catching up and jogging down the hall with the 
volleyball player.  &quot;Jeeze Minako, you&#39;re about as bad as Wakaba.&quot;  The 
basketball player smiled fondly as she remembered her enthusiastic, 
albeit, slightly crazy pigtailed friend. 

      &quot;Who&#39;s Wakaba?&quot;  The blonde&#39;s voice was border lining between 
attempts to be subtle, but obviously dying to know about this girl who 
she seemed to resemble.  &quot;Is she an ex?&quot; 

      If she&#39;d been drinking water, Utena probably would have coughed it 
all up; instead she became wide-eyed, turning completely red and forced 
a torrent of laughing that was so throaty, tears pushed themselves out 
of the corners of their eyes.  &quot;Wakaba?!&quot;  She began, &quot;Yeah right!  We 
were just best friends... well, she was always clinging to me, it was 
kind of annoying sometimes&#151;she used to tell everyone she was my 
girlfriend.  But I knew she was just over protective of me.  Her eyes 
belonged to a certain orange haired panther...&quot; 

      Listening to her classmate, Minako became aware of how clingy she 
was being at the moment and quickly unlinked their arms, giving some 
space.  Noticing the lack of warmth, Utena looked questioningly at the 
blonde before picking up on what she was doing. 

      &quot;Oh, er, it was annoying when Wakaba did it.  She used to grip so 
hard it&#39;d cut off circulation to my arm...&quot; The basketball player took a 
small breath, speaking softly, &quot;I... I don&#39;t mind you.  You have a... a 
gentle touch.&quot;  Determined not to look at the voluptuous blonde because 
of a blush crossing her cheeks Utena focused on the various pictures 
along the walls. 

      She smiled inwardly when she felt the volleyball player move back 
next to her side, slipping her arm into Utena&#39;s and linking their 
fingers.  The pink haired girl bit her lower lip, still fighting 
internally with herself and battling with her behavior.  Though she had 
decided she wouldn&#39;t become more than friends with Minako, her heart and 
body were obviously disobeying. 

      Both girls stopped in front of the bathroom, not very willing to 
part with one another just yet.  Utena could feel electricity pumping 
through her body and most especially where the blonde&#39;s finger tips were 
caressing her own.  Her heart was beating so rapidly, she felt she could 
take on everyone in the United States NBA and still have energy left 
over to carry Minako back to their bed to make... 

      The basketball player blinked rapidly, pulling cleanly away from 
the voluptuous girl&#39;s soft touch, still refusing to look the girl in the 
eye.  She opened the door to the bathroom, pausing a moment. 

      &quot;Um, could you like... talk to yourself... or hum softly, while 
I... go.&quot; 

      Utena could hear the girl behind her giggle softly, probably 
covering her mouth to keep from hurting her feelings. 

      &quot;Hai, Utena-chan.&quot; 

      After she finished, Utena took her time washing her hands, deep in 
thought about her feelings toward Minako.  She vowed not to fall for the 
girl, she wouldn&#39;t do that again.  But what was behind that touch?  The 
pink haired girl felt super charged and it was merely the simple act of 
holding hands with the volleyball player.  Stone-blue eyes stared back 
at themselves in the mirror, becoming stormy at wondering if the touch 
was so evocative, what would kissing the dazzling girl be like? 

      Utena closed her eyes, swallowing unconsciously.  It seemed that 
putting up barriers was futile as she knew she had it bad for the 
blonde.  Did Minako have it just as bad for her, though?  There was a 
resolve set in her stony blue eyes as she reopened them and Utena 
practically threw the door open, startling the girl standing outside of 
it. 

      &quot;Arara, Utena-chan, you scared the crap outta me!&quot;  The volleyball 
player clutched at her chest dramatically, faking a near heart attack.  
So caught up she was in her acting, she was surprised to find the pink 
haired girl standing closely to her&#151;a stubbornness placated across her 
face. 

      Taking a deep breath, Utena began to speak quickly, 
&quot;Doyouhappentolikemeasmorethanafriend?&quot; 

      Dazzling blue eyes blinked rapidly as they attempted to comprehend 
the gibberish coming out of the basketball players mouth.  Minako shook 
her head several times, &quot;I have no idea what you just said...&quot; 

      The taller girl&#39;s face was red and clearly nervous, the girl 
stuttering slightly as she regained her voice and some of her composure, 
&quot;Gomen, what... what I asked was if you happened to like me... as more 
than a friend?&quot;  Stormy blue eyes looked pleadingly into the blondes and 
Utena felt her throat close up while she waited. 

      A smile spread over the girl&#39;s face; not one of her insanely happy 
smiles, nor was it a sad smile, but rather, a genuine smile, a smile 
Utena thought to be the most beautiful smile she&#39;d ever seen.  When 
Minako&#39;s gentle fingers reached up and touched the pink haired girl&#39;s 
cheek, it was all the motivation she needed as she leaned forward and 
captured the blonde girl&#39;s lips in a kiss. 

      And in that kiss, Utena felt like someone was pumping energy 
directly into her body without abandon.  She felt alive, exuberant, and 
so full of power, all from kissing those soft, wonderful lips.  The pink 
haired girl wrapped her arms around the blonde&#39;s curvy body, pulling the 
girl against herself, getting completely caught up in such a simple 
action. 

      After several moments, Minako pulled away gasping slightly, her 
face covered with a light blush and her dazzling blue eyes looking upon 
the basketball player affectionately. 

      &quot;Of course I like you, silly, took you long enough...&quot; 

      In response, Utena leaned in for another short and chaste kiss, 
reveling in the feeling of the voluptuous teen&#39;s lips against her own. 

      The blonde giggled, &quot;I take it you like me too, then?&quot; 

      The basketball player was about to retort when the two girls heard 
a small cough from behind them.  They reluctantly pulled away to find 
Ami and Michiru standing in the hall, Ami too red to meet their eyes and 
Michiru covering her mouth, trying not to laugh or show her smirk, Utena 
wasn&#39;t sure. 

      &quot;You were gone for so long, we wanted to make sure nothing 
happened... but you two seem to be getting on just fine, it seems.&quot;  The 
aqua haired girl smiled, pursing her lips together. 

      &quot;Since we&#39;re getting on just fine, how about you leave us alone 
again,&quot; Minako locked her fingers with Utena&#39;s, &quot;We&#39;ll need, what, 20 
minutes?&quot;  She finished with a wink at the pink haired girl. 

      Utena felt all the blood rush from her head not exactly finding 
any words to respond with. 

------------------------------------------------ 

      &quot;Gosh, I feel like we&#39;re feeding animals at a zoo...&quot;  The jet 
black haired girl crossed her arms over her chest, leaning against the 
brick wall surrounding Juuban High.   

      &quot;That&#39;s a bad comparison; people aren&#39;t allowed to feed the 
animals at the zoo.&quot; 

      Hotaru met up with a pair of sparkling emeralds and scowled.  &quot;Har 
har har.&quot; 

      Both girls stared at one another for a moment before breaking out 
in a fit of laughter.  It lasted for several seconds before dying off 
into a comfortable lull; Makoto went back to watching the school doors 
while the photographer looked down the street nonchalantly, making sure 
they wouldn&#39;t get caught. 

      &quot;Thanks for coming.&quot;  Hotaru gazed towards the tall teen.  To her 
disbelief, she swore she saw the rogue wearing a soft smile. 

      The pale girl felt the corners of her mouth rise slightly in 
response and turned back towards the street, muttering through partly 
open lips, &quot;No problem.&quot; 

      An old couple turned the corner on the sidewalk on the other side 
which prompted the short girl to clear her throat&#151;a warning for the 
older girl to move away.  Makoto sighed as she walked towards Hotaru, 
leaning against the wall next to her, shoving her hands deep into the 
pockets of her baggy corduroys. 

      The photographer noted that her sempai didn&#39;t feel compelled to 
speak and decided to take the initiative, &quot;I take it your &#39;date&#39; went 
well last night... from the contented look on your face it might have 
gone better than well.&quot;  She smirked slightly, looking sideways towards 
the tomboy. 

      &quot;Who knows?&quot;  The chestnut haired girl shrugged, turning away from 
the inquisitive purple eyes. 

      Hotaru covered her mouth, giggling softly.  &quot;Only you and Ami.&quot; 

      An air of silence fell over the two again as they waited for the 
elderly couple to round the opposite corner.  They considered themselves 
lucky that the area was as deserted as it was; though probably due to 
the early morning hour and that no student would be anywhere near the 
school on a non-school day. 

      Except Ami... 

      Makoto openly stared at the two across from her, feeling a tinge 
of pink climb up her ears as she placed herself and Ami in the same 
positions.  The girl was definitely something special to her and after 
last night, she was certain the genius meant something to her that no 
other person alive ever would. 

      &quot;Neh, Makoto-san, about your parents, well, how did they die?&quot;  
The Goth girl&#39;s words came out awkwardly, uncertain and timid. 

      Green eyes lowered to the concrete beneath her feet, her face not 
showing a hint of change or notice that she even heard Hotaru&#39;s 
question.  She heard the dark haired girl mumble an apology, saying that 
Makoto didn&#39;t need to tell her, that she was only curious. 

      &quot;Your father was a doctor, wasn&#39;t he?&quot;  Out of the corner of her 
eye, the tomboy saw the small girl&#39;s fists clenched and her knuckles an 
unbelievable white against her very pale skin.  She shifted on her foot, 
leaning her shoulder and side of her head up against the brick in order 
to better view the Goth girl. 

      Through clenched teeth, the teen spoke, &quot;I&#39;m right, aren&#39;t I?  
When you&#39;d told me about your parents dying, they died at around the 
same time I&#39;d lost mine.  It didn&#39;t make sense, the heavy weight I felt, 
the connection.  But it came together, the next day, the sealed memories 
finally unlocked themselves... your name, I remember your name on it.&quot;  
She spoke heavily, not bringing her eyes up to meet the older girl&#39;s.  
Makoto felt the weight of her words pressing down on her like an intense 
gravity. 

      Sighing, the rogue continued to watch the pale girl in front of 
her, responding with a faint tone of sadness, &quot;I wondered; your name 
isn&#39;t exactly popular, but I guess I was hoping for a chance that I&#39;d be 
wrong.  Considering how cleanly they went about it, I&#39;m surprised you 
survived.&quot; 

      Purple eyes shot upwards, the girl obviously forcing back down a 
torrent of tears, her cheeks flushed with either anger or fright, Makoto 
couldn&#39;t tell, &quot;Did they do the same thing to you too?! I mean, you 
shouldn&#39;t have survived either, but yet...  I don&#39;t know why I 
remembered your name out of all on the list, but... but...&quot; 

      From the direction of the school, the two teens heard a door being 
shoved open and pounding footsteps moving quickly towards the gates.  
Immediately Hotaru began to breathe deeply, trying to steady her shaking 
body.  The tomboy reached out, patting a hand on the girl&#39;s shoulder and 
giving her a look that said she&#39;d take care of it, before walking past 
her to the boy at the gate. 

      &quot;Hey Mako-chan!  We&#39;re starving, they locked up the kitchen!!  Can 
you believe it?&quot;  Harry stood at the bars, slightly out of breath.  Far 
behind him holding the door open was the familiar lanky ex-red head; the 
tape across his broken nose standing out quite unsightly against his 
elongated face. 

      The tall girl threw the bag of food over wall, watching as the 
dark haired boy barely caught it, grinning like a fool the whole time. 

      &quot;What&#39;s got you so happy?&quot;  Makoto glanced towards Ron, raising an 
eyebrow at Harry, laying the innuendo on thick. 

      He merely laughed at the girl, &quot;Yeah right!  He&#39;s got the right 
shade of hair now, but wrong gender, could be shorter too... maybe with 
eyes like the depths of space...&quot;  The shaggy haired boy trailed off, 
looking fondly at nothing in particular until the tomboy in front of him 
coughed softly, throwing her head to the right indicating the object of 
the boy&#39;s desire. 

      A blush crossed the green eyed boy&#39;s cheeks and he scratched his 
head, looking in the opposite direction. 

      &quot;Right, right then.  Well, if you really want to know why I&#39;m a 
grinning fool, perhaps you should stop by the Hikawa Shrine tonight, 
sometime &#39;round 7 pm.  Bound to be a bash of a time.&quot;  Harry continued 
to grin mysteriously, though Makoto could put two and two together. 

      She merely narrowed her eyes in response causing the teen to 
fidget, &quot;Ah yeah, thanks for the food, Mako-chan, Hotaru-san, see you 
Tuesday!&quot;  A short wave and the dark haired boy took off running towards 
his lanky friend, pushing him inside when he got to the door. 

      Makoto took a deep breath, shaking her head.  A smile crossed her 
face as curiosity won out and she knew she&#39;d be making an impromptu 
visit to the shrine later this evening; if the surprise awaiting her 
didn&#39;t amuse her, at least she&#39;d have the blue haired eye candy instead.  
She sighed, remembering that Hotaru was standing there. 

      &quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s get some breakfast,&quot; The rogue didn&#39;t wait for a 
reply as she walked away from the Goth girl.  A few seconds later, she 
heard the faint clacks of the short girl&#39;s boots begin to follow and 
slowed down so the two could walk side by side.</pre>
