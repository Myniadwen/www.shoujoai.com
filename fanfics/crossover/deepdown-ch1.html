	-------------------------------------------------

	A young chestnut haired girl sat straight up in her bed, sweat dripping off 
her forehead, her breathing inconsistent and heavy.  Covering her face with 
her hands and growling in frustration, she swung her long scarred legs over 
the side of the bed and bent over trying to regain her composure.  There was 
no light in the room, aside from the glow of the numbers of the alarm clock 
to the left of the bed.

	The room was hardly quiet; with a fan buzzing in the corner and a radio 
playing soft music across from the bed.  Despite that, the teenager felt as 
though she could hear the smallest pin drop on a bed of the softest pillows. 
  Looking around the room through squinted eyes, she willed herself to 
adjust to the darkness.  After a few moments, she stood up making her way 
quietly to the door. She opened the squeaky door as gently as possible, in 
order to not wake up her light sleeping guardian down the hall.

	Tiptoeing down the carpeted hallway and entering the bathroom in a similar 
ghostly fashion, the tall and slim form stopped in front of the sink.  After 
turning the faucet on cold, she began splashing her face with the water, 
trying to wash away the remnants of the nightmare.  Allowing emerald eyes to 
focus, she looked into the mirror and began to study the form before her, as 
if looking for some sort of answer.

	A disheveled looking teen stared back through sweaty and matted chestnut 
and brown hair.  She was no more or less than 5 feet and 9 inches, wearing a 
torn System of a Down t-shirt and faded dark green shorts.  Her face wore 
years of pain, which showed even more in the early morning wake.  The body 
was slim and lanky, with the exception of the slightly large breasts bulging 
in the t-shirt.  Were it not for the breasts, one would quickly assume that 
this was a boy they were staring at.  Scars marred across the legs and under 
the shirt, coupled with hair that was not any lower than the jaw line on her 
face.

	&quot;Figures you had to dream about that.  Just when things might be going your 
way, you have to bring up things from the past.&quot;

	After a deep breath, the girl continued.

	&quot;Just push it back down Mako, there&#39;s nothing you can do about it now.&quot;

	Brushing back her matted hair away from her face, Kino Makoto looked back 
down at the sink and sighed.

	&#39;Life is always intolerable.  At least it&#39;s less so now, than it was then.  
Try to be positive for once, you dolt!&#39;
