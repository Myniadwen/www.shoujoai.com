<h1>Sailor HIME (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This is a fusion of Sailor
Moon characters to the series finale of Mai-HIME, so
I&#39;ll be taking a few liberties with the two titles,
but I hope you&#39;ll enjoy it!


Rei Hino glared up towards the top of the building,
her black hair flowing like a wave over her school
uniform. &quot;You defeated some HIME and destroyed
Infinity,&quot; she said as she raised her pistols, &quot;but I
can&#39;t let you continue on!&quot;

&quot;So Rei,&quot; Minako Aino said regretfully, her long
blonde hair glowing in the twilight as the blue eyed
woman murmured, &quot;you still can&#39;t accept my love?&quot; She
jumped, golden chain lashing out but Rei leapt clear.

Her twin black pistols spat out bursts of ice as Rei
dodged her attacks, but Minako gracefully swept them
aside with her length of chain. &quot;It isn&#39;t about love,&quot;
she answered her intently as she leaped over the
chain, &quot;but saving lives.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got to stop this!&quot; Usagi Tsukino called out to
them from where the blonde haired girl stood by the
sidelines, her hair flowing down in twin streams of
gold, &quot;You&#39;re just playing into Mamoru and Artemis&#39;
hands!&quot;

&quot;They can&#39;t hear you now,&quot; Makoto Kino said to Usagi
softly, her eyes glowing an unearthly looking green as
the brown haired woman hefted a black long sword. A
grim smile, &quot;And you have me to contend with.&quot;

&quot;Just because Mamoru looks like your ex, you don&#39;t
have to...&quot; Usagi started to stay, looking into the
eyes of her roommate and closest friend.

&quot;Die!&quot; Makoto cried out as she charged and swung,
Usagi blocking the attacks with her glowing
wristbands.

From the shadows two figures watched the battle
intently. &quot;My Lady,&quot; Hotaru asked softly, her black
hair falling around her face, &quot;should we intervene?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Chibi-Usa said as she shook her head
regretfully, &quot;we have to get by them, instead.&quot; Her
fluffy pink hair seemed to glow a moment as she said
gravely, &quot;Stopping Mamoru has become our main
priority.&quot;

Hotaru gestured, her hand quickly shifting to a
glowing sword as she answered gravely, &quot;Of course,
m&#39;lady.&quot;

&quot;Ha, I have you!&quot; Minako yelled as a swing of her
golden chain pinned Rei&#39;s arms to her sides. With a
twist she yanked the stunned Rei to her then she
folded her into her arms, holding her with surprising
gentleness.

&quot;Mina...&quot; Rei blinked at her, surprised at the
tenderness in her eyes.

Minako drew back a bit, meeting Rei&#39;s eyes gently.
&quot;This is all I&#39;ve wanted,&quot; she admitted, &quot;just to be
with you, beloved.&quot;

Rei looked away from her uncomfortably. &quot;I don&#39;t know
if I can have the emotions you want me to have,&quot; she
admitted, &quot;but I do care for you, Minako.&quot; And with
that she bent forward, kissing her gently on the lips.

&quot;No,&quot; Makoto growled as she pressed her attack against
Usagi, &quot;they&#39;ve broken free from Mamoru&#39;s influence!
But how?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Usagi said cheerfully, using her
flames to try to drive Makoto back, &quot;but I&#39;m glad they
did!&quot;

In the darkness of the great cavern beneath the school
a white haired boy asked quietly, &quot;What happened,
sir?&quot;

Mamoru gave him a scornful look, the red rose that the
black haired man wore glowing an unearthly scarlet.
&quot;It should be obvious even to you, Artemis,&quot; he said
coldly, holding on to the katana with both hands.

&quot;Sorry boss,&quot; Artemis flashed him a casual grin,
&quot;you&#39;ll have to spell it out for me.&quot;

With a scowl Mamoru said, &quot;With the power of the Red
Star I drove them to war, but their true emotions can
free them from my influence. Once Minako confessed her
love to Rei their minds cleared, freeing them.&quot;

&quot;Huh, that&#39;s unexpected,&quot; Artemis admitted. &quot;Do you
think any of &#39;em are smart enough to work it out on
their own?&quot;

&quot;Even if they do it&#39;s too late,&quot; Mamoru declared as he
gestured dramatically with his sword, &quot;once Makoto
defeats Usagi I&#39;ll claim her as my bride, and together
we&#39;ll create the world of our dreams, Crystal Tokyo.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Artemis sweatdropped.

BOOM!

Both men jerked in surprise as the gateway to the
cavern exploded inward, two figures racing inside.
Hotaru carried Chibi-Usa close to her as the sword she
used to break the barrier smoked in her hand, her
violet eyes dark as she scanned the chamber.

&quot;Scan for Luna,&quot; Chibi-Usa said as she leapt down,
Artemis gesturing to summon forth the unearthly Youma
that served him, &quot;she&#39;s the key.&quot;

&quot;Of course, m&#39;lady,&quot; Hotaru said as Chibi-Usa began to
beat the Youma back.

Part of Hotaru wanted desperately to fight by her
beloved&#39;s side but instead she focused her gave on her
surroundings, sweeping the massive structures for the
right energy signature. Finally she spotted her,
sealing in what almost looked like a crystal crescent
moon.

&quot;I have it,&quot; Hotaru snatched Chibi-Usa up, cradling
her close as she leapt.

&quot;NO!&quot; Mamoru roared out in rage.

They soared to the complicated structure atop the
chamber, Chibi-Usa&#39;s hair blazing as she channeled
power into Hotaru. The sword reappeared as Hotaru&#39;s
black garb shifted silver, then together they struck
out at the crystal prison... and it exploded in a
flash of energy.

Luna floated there, black hair flowing around her as
she smiled gently at her rescuers. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she
murmured, then she was gone, streaking off through the
roof of the chamber and away.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry boss,&quot; Artemis said weakly as he summoned
another bunch of Youma, &quot;I&#39;m sure the next bunch&#39;ll
get them.&quot;

&quot;IT&#39;S A LITTLE LATE NOW!&quot; Mamoru roared in
exasperation.

Luna shimmered as she floated in the temple,
surrounded by glowing crescent moon shapes. &quot;It&#39;s time
for the sorrow to be over,&quot; she said joyously as they
arched out into the night, &quot;all those lost will be
returned to us.&quot;

Michiru Kaoru cried softly in the dorm room as she
held the armband close to her, the green haired young
woman rocking gently. Her thoughts were filled with
the woman she had loved, a love she had never
confessed and would now never be realized.

&quot;What in the...?&quot; Michiru blinked as Luna appeared,
energy dancing around her, then the sparks of light
pulled together in as familiar form. The young woman
looked around, sandy blonde hair falling in her eyes
before her gaze fell on Michiru.

&quot;Haruka,&quot; Michiru breathed out, then practically threw
herself at Haruka Tenoh, tackling the other woman to
the ground.

In her office Professor Ami Mizuno looked out into the
night, the blue haired young woman&#39;s expression
utterly blank. Her grief tore at her, but she couldn&#39;t
seem to cry.. instead it felt as if her heart itself
would stop.

&quot;You,&quot; Ami&#39;s voice shifted from neutral to enraged,
then she blinked in surprise as Luna smiled gently.

Light shifted, gathering, then in seconds revealed a
tall, black haired woman who gazed at her with
tenderness. &quot;Ami?&quot; Setrsuna Meiou asked softly.

Ami rose on shaky legs to take Setsuna&#39;s hand, then
unconsciously drew her into a embrace. &quot;I love you,&quot;
Ami murmured into her shoulder.

All around the campus similar scenes played out, those
that had been separated from their beloved reunite,
their powers restored. On the battlefield Makoto
cried, confusion warring across her features as she
saw the Hime gathering in the sky above them, &quot;What&#39;s
happening?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s ending at last,&quot; Usagi said as she raced close,
turning the fearsome blade aside with her wristbands.
She met those eyes, normally so filled with caring and
knew what she had to do... hat she should have done
before now.

&quot;Usagi?&quot; Makoto blurted as Usagi pulled her close.

&quot;I love you,&quot; Usagi said honestly, looking up to met
the taller girl&#39;s eyes.

Makoto staggered as the green seemed to leak out from
her eyes, the sword clattering to the ground from now
numb hands. Gently Makoto kissed Usagi, the two
kneeling on the ground as they held each other close.

Mamoru and Artemis looked at each other with wide eyes
as they felt the Red Star explode, the power of many
of the Hime destroying it utterly. &quot;So boss,&quot; Artemis
said as the last of his Youma tried to slow Hotaru and
Chibi-Usa, &quot;what do we do now?&quot;

&quot;Not much else we can do,&quot; Mamoru sighed, &quot;other than
run.&quot;

Both men bolted, a passage opening up in the cavern
wall and leading up into the Library. They raced
through the building, explosions rippling off in the
distance, then ran out the front doors... only to
freeze.

Haruka Tenoh cracked her knuckles, her smile
particularly grim as Michiru stood beside her. Ami,
Setsuna and the others waited around them, all with
their powers manifested and ready to be used. &quot;Uh oh.&quot;
Artemis squeaked.

They turned to flee back into the building and saw
Chibi-Usa and Hotaru, both smudged from battle and
looking annoyed. &quot;Don&#39;t even think about it,&quot; Hotaru
growled.

Mamoru turned to the group of annoyed woman and smiled
as charmingly as possible. &quot;Could we talk about this?&quot;
he asked, holding his hands up in surrender.

&quot;No!&quot; they all roared and proceeded to beat both men
bloody.

End

Notes: I actually considered a serious crossover
between both universes, but sanity prevailed and I
decided to have some fun. This is a compression of the
final two episodes of Mai Hime mixed with Sailor Moon
bits, played somewhat more light hearted of course.
The couplings are mostly my imagination, other than
Haruka and Michiru, of course.</pre>
