<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 49 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/locket-ch48.html">Back to Part 48</a><pre>        The sports car left the city of Tokyo itself, quickly moving 
down the snow covered roads. Colored a deep black, it&#39;s headlights 
lit up the road ahead as it was driven with cool competence. The 
woman who was sitting in the driver&#39;s seat pushed her orange hair 
back as she said, &quot;Thanks for coming along with me, Setsuna.&quot;

        &quot;I know how important these people are to you, Juri,&quot; 
Setsuna answered, her dark black hair flowing around her like a 
wave, &quot;I&#39;m glad you invited me.&quot; She paused thoughtfully, &quot;It&#39;s 
almost like meeting your family, in a way.&quot;

        Juri blinked in surprise, then she laughed softly. &quot;Now 
there&#39;s an interesting mental image,&quot; she said with a slight grin.

        &quot;You know what I mean,&quot; Setsuna chuckled.

        They pulled into a long driveway, driving up to the front 
door&#39;s where a valet waited to take the keys. Juri got out first, 
looking coolly stylish in her long leather coat before going around 
to Setsuna&#39;s side to help her evening gown clad partner out. Juri 
then passed the keys to the young man along with a generous 
tip, &quot;Here you go.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you, ma&#39;am,&quot; he cautiously got behind the wheel and 
drove off, parking in a spot not far from where they stood.

        Setsuna looked around her, taking in their surroundings. The 
mansion was almost over the top in it&#39;s elegance, perched on the 
very edge of the city of Tokyo. Within the fences the now snow 
covered lawn stretched out in perfectly maintained order with 
dormant plants sticking up, carefully tended for the coming spring.

        &quot;Impressive,&quot; Setsuna finally had to admit.

        &quot;A bit overdone,&quot; Juri quietly admitted as they went up the 
stairs to the front door. Before she could even try to knock on it a 
pretty, brown haired maid opened up the door, smiling up at the two 
of them cheerfully.

        &quot;Ms. Arisugawa,&quot; the maid nodded to her respectfully, &quot;it&#39;s 
good to see you again.&quot; Her eyes widened just slightly at 
Setsuna, &quot;And you brought a guest as well. I&#39;ll see if I can 
rearrange the seating arrangements for dinner. Can I get your coats?&quot;

        &quot;We won&#39;t be staying that long, thanks,&quot; Juri slipped her 
long coat off, revealing a black woman&#39;s business suit beneath 
it, &quot;but you can certainly take out coats.&quot;

        Setsuna&#39;s red dress hugged her slim body from breasts to 
ankles, her shoulders bare and long gold earrings dangling from her 
ears. &quot;As they walked down the hall together she murmured to 
Juri, &quot;Do you think this dress is a bit much?&quot;

        &quot;You look gorgeous,&quot; Juri answered softly. They reached a 
door where a blonde maid awaited and Juri asked, &quot;Are you ready?&quot;

        &quot;No,&quot; Setsuna admitted, &quot;but lets go in anyway.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Juri nodded slightly to the maid.

        The room was festively decorated, a brightly lit up tree set 
up on one side with gifts laid out below it. A table fully loaded 
with food and drink was on one side, and two young men moved through 
the group with trays of drinks. An interesting group it was, too, 
all young men and women who carried a kind of nobility about them.

        &quot;Juri-sempai,&quot; a blue haired young man made his way over to 
them almost as soon as they entered the room, &quot;Merry Christmas!&quot;

        &quot;Hey, Miki,&quot; Juri hugged him impulsively. She pushed him 
back slightly, &quot;Miki Kaoru, I&#39;d like you to meet my partner, Setsuna 
Meiou.&quot;

        &quot;Partner?&quot; Miki looked honestly confused, &quot;but I thought 
that you ran Arisugawa&#39;s Locket all on your own?&quot;

        A blonde, her long hair braided to fall down her back and 
dressed in a cream colored dress, made her way over to Miki&#39;s 
side. &quot;I don&#39;t think she means that kind of partner, Miki,&quot; she 
pointed out to him gently.

        &quot;Oh?&#39; Miki blinked, then his eyes widened as he got 
it, &quot;Oh!&quot; He grinned up at both women, &quot;Congratulations!&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Setsuna smiled, shaking Miki&#39;s hand. She looked 
over at the other young woman, &quot;I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve met?&quot;

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Miki blushed rather cutely as he 
continued, &quot;Setsuna Meiou, I&#39;d like you to meet my partner, Nanami 
Kiryuu.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you,&quot; Nanami smiled, &quot;have you been 
together long?&quot;

        &quot;Nearly a year now,&quot; Setsuna offered, &quot;and you?&quot;

        &quot;Nearly two,&quot; Miki smiled. He paused before adding, &quot;I think 
Touga said something about wanting to talk with you.&quot;

        &quot;Hmm,&quot; Juri frowned slightly, &quot;Setsuna, do you want to wait 
here?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m coming with you,&quot; Setsuna said softly.

        Juri smiled, &quot;Well, I thought I should offer. See you later, 
Miki.&quot; With that both women made their way over to where Touga 
Kiryuu stood talking to Saionji.

        &quot;Arisugawa,&quot; Touga called out as she got near, the red 
haired man&#39;s face lighting up in an honest smile.

        Juri felt a bit of relief that his breath didn&#39;t smell of 
any alcohol. The glass he held bubbled, and she had to fight back a 
smile realizing it was probably just ginger-ale. &quot;Kiryuu,&quot; she 
echoed his greeting quite gravely, then smiled.

        &quot;It&#39;s good to see you Juri,&quot; Saionji extended his hand, &quot;and 
who&#39;s your lovely friend.&quot;

        &quot;Setsuna Meiou, I&#39;d like you to met Touga and Saionji.&quot; Juri 
gave both men a warning glance, &quot;Down boys, she&#39;s with me.&quot;

        &quot;Then congratulations,&quot; Touga gave them both a gentlemanly 
bow. He gave Setsuna a thoughtful look, &quot;I&#39;m glad that Juri found 
someone of her caliber to be with.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Setsuna nodded slightly.

        &quot;And I look forward to getting to know you better,&quot; Saionji 
said gravely, reaching out to shake her hand firmly.

        &quot;It&#39;s good to see you, Juri,&quot; a warm voice said. Utena and 
Anthy had come up behind them, and along with them were the other 
members of the duelists. &quot;And it&#39;s good to see you once again, 
Setsuna,&quot; Utena softly added.

        &quot;I&#39;m honored to be here,&quot; Setsuna said.

        &quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; Touga smiled at the others, &quot;I know 
that all of us have other things that we need to go to tonight.&quot; 
Ruefully he added, &quot;Nanami and I are visiting our parents tonight, 
and I am not looking forward to it.&quot;

        There was sympathetic laughter from the others.

        &quot;I just wanted to get us all together tonight,&quot; Touga 
continued. &quot;There is much we all have in common, and I think that 
will grow in time, not lessen.&quot; He raised his glass of ginger-
ale, &quot;Merry Christmas, everyone, and to friends both old and new.&quot;

        &quot;To friends,&quot; Utena and the others raised their glasses.

        &quot;Merry Christmas,&quot; Juri gently slipped her arm across his 
shoulders, hugging him a bit awkwardly. He stood there stiffly in 
surprise a moment, then laughed.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Touga answered. He gave her a smile, &quot;Now I&#39;m sure 
that you have a party over at the Locket to take care of?&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; Juri let him go, &quot;but keep in touch, all 
right?&quot; She looked up to take in the room full of people, &quot;And that 
goes for all of you, too!&quot;

        To a chorus of agreement Juri and Setsuna walked back down 
the hallway, collecting their coats from the maid. &quot;You know,&quot; 
Setsuna murmured as they went outside, the valet fetching Juri&#39;s 
car, &quot;I think I like them.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Juri got the door for Setsuna, then she got in 
and they sped off into the night. &quot;I&#39;m glad I gave May permission to 
open up tonight,&quot; Juri noted the time, &quot;because there is no way I&#39;m 
going to get there in time.&quot;

        &quot;May can handle things,&quot; Setsuna said firmly.

        Back in the city the nightclub known as Arisugawa&#39;s Locket 
was busier than usual, on account of the Christmas holiday. As had 
become the tradition a pile of presents were sitting by the 
entrance, and were being passed out to the customers as they came 
inside.

        &quot;Here ya go,&quot; Ryouko handed a gift over with a grin. The 
blue-haired bartender was taking a turn passing out the gifts, 
standing there by Hitomi.

        &quot;Will Minagi be okay up at the bar by herself?&quot; Hitomi 
asked, the brown haired girl looking cute in her schoolgirl&#39;s 
uniform.

        &quot;Ah, she&#39;s got Mahoro up there to help,&quot; Ryouko shrugged it 
off. &quot;And May is standing by the bar, doing a pretty good Juri 
impersonation.&quot;

        &quot;May really is good at that,&quot; Hitomi admitted. Her eyes 
widened in surprise at seeing a newbie coming in, tonight of all 
nights. &quot;My name is Hitomi, welcome to the Locket!&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; the black haired young looked a bit nervous, 
dressed in garb almost resembling that a shrine maiden and at her 
side she carried a sword, clearly not a false one. &quot;My name is 
Motoko.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;ll have to surrender the weapon at the bar,&quot; Ryouko 
passed the gift over.

        &quot;If I must,&quot; Motoko answered as she looked out over the 
crowd. It almost looked like she wanted to run away, but she 
stiffened her back and went on in.

        &quot;First timer,&quot; Ryouko noted.

        &quot;Uh huh,&quot; Hitomi agreed.
