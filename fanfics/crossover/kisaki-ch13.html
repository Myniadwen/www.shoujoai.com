&quot;The HiME Star was the source of the Obsidian Lord&#39;s influence and 
power. Without it, he could have never manipulated the Ikusahime into 
their Carnival. Only with its threat could the dark lord move his 
princesses around like pawns on a chessboard.&quot; -- HiME Database, 
Carnival terminology.

A nine year old Natsuki Kruger ran through the usually quiet keep she 
called her home, situated in the outermost regions of the Windbloom 
Kingdom. Today, the fortress was bustling with activity to the point 
where she felt lost traversing the halls and rooms she had been in 
countless times. Well wishers, nobles from the capital, nurses, 
relatives that she had never met before in her life &#150; anyone and 
everyone was at County Grauwald&#39;s keep that day. She didn&#39;t particularly 
like all the commotion. These stupid people kept getting in her way when 
all she wanted to do was go upstairs and be with her parents. She&#39;d 
escaped from the servants who had been assigned to tend to her using her 
exquisite ninja skills. Or what she thought were exquisite ninja skills. 
The pretty teenager walking by a distracted male butler probably helped 
her out.

Finally, after twenty minutes, she made it to the third floor of the 
keep, where she could hear pained groaning and screams. One or two 
people tried to grab at her, but she swiftly ducked out of their way. 
&quot;Miss Kruger, come back here! You mustn&#39;t go inside now!&quot;

Well, screw that! She was not going to miss an event she&#39;d been hoping 
would come for nine whole months! That was almost a year, dammit. All 
for a comparatively fleeting moment. Darting around tables and taking 
swift corners around well known areas, she avoided the guards and 
relatives who were seeking her out. &quot;Miss Kruger, you won&#39;t want to see! 
Trust me! It&#39;s gross!&quot;

The lame attempts of a young man to halt her progress. She didn&#39;t care 
if it was &#39;gross.&#39; She wanted to see. A few more turns and she was right 
at the door of her parent&#39;s bedchamber. Countess Saeko sounded as if she 
was in extreme pain, as if she&#39;d taken some kind of wound in intense 
combat. Naturally concerned for her mother, Natsuki ran through the 
guards on call and kicked open the door. There, her mother, laden with 
sweat, had her dress hiked up to where it most certainly shouldn&#39;t have 
been and was dealing with a particularly painful labor.

&quot;Moth--!&quot; Natsuki began to call out, but was plucked up an uncle and 
taken back out into the hall. He placed her on a bench and pointed right 
at her face.

&quot;Your mother has a lot to deal with right now, so children cannot be 
present. I want you to wait out here, and we&#39;ll call you when she gives 
birth. Okay?&quot; He sounded calm, but even Natsuki could pick up on an 
underlying level of stress.

&quot;Is everything going to be all right?&quot; She inquired.

He managed a smile, though it was clearly forced. &quot;Of course, Natsuki. 
Everything will be fine.&quot;

Her uncle then disappeared back into the room, shutting the door and 
leaving Natsuki to sit alone in the hall while her mother shouted out in 
pain. For forty-five more minutes, bringing the total time of labor up 
to three painful hours, Natsuki sat and winced with every wail. Screams 
were mutated with her mother&#39;s sobbing. Demands for more painkillers 
were unmet, as she was already at her body&#39;s limit. Then, finally, the 
doctors gave in and conducted a Caesarean before Saeko Kruger could 
perish from blood loss and internal complications.

After a few more minutes, more wailing followed, but this was a short 
and high pitched scream that was clearly not Natsuki&#39;s mother. Natsuki 
bolted upright and tried to shove her way past the barrier again, but 
was rebuffed. She could proudly hear her father say, &quot;It&#39;s a girl!&quot;

Natsuki, who had until then been an only child, beamed happily at the 
news. The young babe&#39;s crying stopped almost immediately, and her father 
and relatives conversed happily while Saeko rested under the effects of 
anesthesia. After twenty minutes, Natsuki was finally let inside the 
room, now cleaned up. Her father, the stern but protective count, 
carried a bundle in his arms.

Count Kruger knelt down beside Natsuki, a grin on his face, and 
displayed the new sister. An infant with bright golden hair stared back 
for a moment before eyes focused on something else. Natsuki laughed in 
disbelief. So it had really happened! She finally had a sibling. Way to 
go, old man! Her father said, &quot;Her name is Alyssa. Do you want to hold 
her?&quot;

Natsuki nodded fiercely. Count Kruger handed over the infant and 
instructed Natsuki in the proper way to hold her. Once Natsuki was 
settled, Alyssa resting against her, her father stood back up to 
continue his conversation with various relatives and noblemen. Sitting 
down in a chair against the wall, Natsuki happily looked down at her 
newborn sister and tried her best to get the girl to focus on her. 
Alyssa was her name. How beautiful! In a few years, she pictured that 
they would be a dynamic duo of terror, wreaking havoc in the keep and 
putting their parents&#39; stress levels through the roof. Yes, a fresh 
little minion to mold into a proper sidekick. Wonderful!

&quot;Such a quiet child,&quot; one of the noblemen stated. &quot;Just two little cries 
after delivery, and then silence. Either an old soul who&#39;s done this too 
many times, or a dispirited youth who couldn&#39;t care less about the 
situation. What think you?&quot;

Dispirited? Natsuki stared down at her sister, who looked back with 
absolutely blank eyes. She hadn&#39;t noticed the first time just how... 
empty those eyes truly were. Like... like her sister had no soul or will 
to live &#150; a body with no spirit! Then, almost as soon as those wayward 
thoughts entered Natsuki&#39;s mind, Alyssa&#39;s eyes shut and the infant&#39;s 
body became incredibly still. No fidgeting. No gentle movement that 
would have indicated breath. Not anything.

Natsuki&#39;s eyes darted up in a panic. The adults were not paying 
attention. With them distracted, Natsuki adjusted her hold so that she 
might use one arm to gently poke the side of Alyssa&#39;s face. She was just 
paranoid, surely. But there was no permanent harm in waking the child up 
just to make sure. Again, there was no movement. Natsuki&#39;s breath 
intensified. Another poke, this one harder. Nothing. She was sure, now, 
that the infant was not breathing. Her flesh became cold, and upon 
realizing just what had happened, Natsuki let out a horrified scream 
that could be heard well outside of the keep.

Count Kruger spun around immediately, snatching the dead infant away and 
examining Alyssa himself. She was quickly handed to one of the doctors 
nearby, who regretfully informed the count that young Alyssa Kruger had 
not survived her first day. Always known for his furious temper, Count 
Kruger bellowed at the doctor to leave and never return. His head then 
snapped around to face Natsuki.

&quot;You!&quot; He screamed. &quot;What did you do?!&quot;

Natsuki could only cry and shake her head. Nothing, she thought. I did 
nothing. Unable to stand her blubbering, Count Kruger hissed at her and 
ordered her to leave the room immediately. She retreated to her own 
bedchamber, where she slid down in the corner and wept. Had it been her 
fault? Did she hold Alyssa wrong? She simply did not understand. Neither 
did the doctors. She had been perfectly healthy physically. It simply 
looked as if the infant had no will or energy to live in such a body. It 
remained a mystery from that day on, but it was never spoken of again. 
Her father forbid it.

And although it could not have logically been Natsuki&#39;s fault, for those 
next two years, she could have sworn they looked at her differently. And 
although she tried not to think about it, and although she ordered 
Shizuru and those closest to her never to bring it up, she couldn&#39;t help 
but be haunted by those empty and lifeless eyes that had been open for 
so short a time. A shallow blue. Not vivid, like the sky, but gray and 
cold like the flesh of a corpse.

- - -

Natsuki leapt into consciousness, her muscles tense from the visions 
that lingered in her mind&#39;s eye. Panting in fear, as it had been years 
since she had a dream about that horrible incident, she slowly slid into 
a sitting position and place her head into her hands. She had been given 
Ashura&#39;s private suite, and it was blissfully secluded from the rest of 
the base. The last thing she wanted was to let her Otome see her in such 
a frazzled state. Three deep, calming breaths. It would be fine. It was 
just a dream.

Although she had not been dreaming, she felt like she had a hangover. 
Her head pounded. Her bare feet coming to rest against the marble below, 
she stood and stumbled towards the suite&#39;s bathroom. Ashura&#39;s things had 
been cleared out, but the Dammerung attendants would have most certainly 
left aspirin behind in the medicine cabinet. She flung it open and 
sighed in absolute frustration. Nothing. Just her luck.

She sank to her knees and gripped the sides of her skull with her hands, 
shutting her eyes tightly and trying to will away the effects of the 
horrible migrane. As the pain intensified, so did her rage. The dream, 
coupled with the building anger stemming from an unknown source, forced 
her to lash out. Her arm swung through the air and her fist connected 
with the wall, leaving a minor dent and a droplet of blood behind. Her 
lust for sudden violence was not satiated. But perhaps, in a way, that 
was for the better.

There was a knock on the main door. She stood and made her way to it, 
trying her best to suppress the beast within. Opening the door, she was 
greeted by Haruka, now in a white uniform, and Arika. The general was 
the one to speak, of course. &quot;Headmistress, we&#39;re ready to move out when 
you are.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be out in a minute. Have the team assemble outside.&quot; She slammed 
the door in their faces.

There had been no further reports from China after the latest Ikusahime 
attack there, but she was not about to chase them all over the vast 
mainland. She was going to bring them back. She would force them to act, 
not the other way around. As such, her plan was to lure them to Kyoto by 
launching a massive attack on the main HiME base there. While the 
Iolites would hold their positions in the city, preventing the HiME from 
land grabbing, the elite would strike at their heart. Hopefully, if the 
Ikusahime were near, it would force them out of hiding.

So, perhaps this unexplainable rage would be to her benefit. Perhaps it 
was a delayed reaction in regards to Shizuru&#39;s betrayal. Shizuru... Her 
thoughts were not quite her own. Shizuru likely never loved you, anyway. 
May she be damned for her insurrection. The lowest layer of hell is 
reserved for betrayers, and there she will rot for eternity.

Natsuki frozen, resting her arm against a nearby table, balancing 
herself. No, that wasn&#39;t fair. That was so rash and reckless a statement 
that it didn&#39;t suit her calculating nature. So why had she thought it? 
She felt so... off. So unlike herself. But perhaps that stray thought 
was right, in a way. Shizuru had betrayed her trust, and that was that. 
She didn&#39;t deserve any respect or the benefit of the doubt. Right? She 
shook her head clear of those thoughts. There was no time to deal with 
that.

She dressed herself in her traditional clothing and left her new suite 
behind, heading out into open. There, her team of Garderobe meisters 
waited patiently. It was time to make some noise in Kyoto. But wouldn&#39;t 
it be so much more efficient to just have the Ikusahime kill each other 
off, like in the legends?

No one yet noticed the new faint red star in the sky.

- - -

&quot;Load chrome cartridge!&quot;

Her cannon materialized and powered up, charging vast amounts of energy 
within. Gently pulling the trigger, a highly concentrated laser cut 
through the once silent air with a roar, the force pushing her back 
against the braces built into her robe. The blast connected with an 
anti-infantry cannon system in the distance. The HiME device was melted 
down into nothingness, the rest of the pieces shooting up into the air. 
Her Element hissed as it fell into its rapid cool down mode, and she was 
forced to wait roughly five seconds before she could fire again.

When she did, a twin of the first gun went up as well. Then a defensive 
structure. Then, when the HiME were swarming out of their outposts like 
ants fleeing from a crushed anthill, she trained their guns on them. She 
forced them to scurry out of harms way. Her gun was not rapid enough to 
catch them all, however, so she had to order her troops forward.

&quot;Move in!&quot; She yelled. Ah, yes, what of the snipers she was warned about 
on her first day on Earth? &quot;Keep at a low altitude!&quot;

She took flight, cannon in hand, and shot forward through the sky, 
making sure that she did not fly higher than the buildings around her. 
Haruka, now using Ashura&#39;s Quartz GEM, and Ann were at either side. The 
rest of their task force was slightly behind and below. The Otome 
divided as a chest-thumping bang went off in the distance. Another 
defensive cannon in the distant hillside! Natsuki froze midair and lined 
up a shot. Her Element went off again, slicing through trees and brush 
until it came in contact with the intended target. Another one up in 
flames.

I simply must get Shizuru and the Ikusahime back in Kyoto. I must! They 
could not be left to run amok on the mainland. With that thought in 
mind, she dove down the moment she found one of the HiME Heirs, and 
Natsuki roughly kicked her across the face. The girl went down to the 
ground, knocked out from the force of the blow &#150; robe and speed having 
made it all that much more painful.

Instinctively, she formed a robe-powered shield the moment she heard two 
cracks from a sniper rifle in front of her. A young man from a HiME 
loyal militia had opened fire on her. Had she not formed the line of 
defense, the bullets would have easily ripped apart her chest. She slid 
through the air and out of the way of a third shot, and countered him. 
Her gun was much, much better than his. A silver cartridge fueled blast 
tore through his cover and incinerated him along with it.

Ann Lu, spotting a second sharpshooter, dove down at breakneck speed to 
prevent him from pulling the trigger. With one fell swoop of her double 
ended scythe, he was gutted and on the ground. Seeing a few other 
soldiers and HiME Heirs near the position, she shot forward and swung 
her weapon again. Two went down. She blocked a saber attack from a HiME 
Heir using the shaft of her scythe. Ann countered with a kick and 
another slice.

Natsuki watched as Carla and Akane went down to street level to take out 
what enemies they could. She was about to do the same, using her 
secondaries and martial arts skills, but found herself pausing in 
midair. What was that noise? Straining her ears to listen, she thought 
that it was coming from underground, of all places. Then, she realized.

A flute.

Some members of the Twelve still had their Children and powers, didn&#39;t 
they? Shizuru had left them behind to guard the city. How very smart of 
her. And how very fortunate for Natsuki. Any Ikusahime taken hostage 
would be perfect bait for the rest of the lot. It was quite obvious that 
the Mistress of Yatagarasu was trying to lure them into the subway 
systems. There was an exposed tunnel about four hundred meters to her 
right. But, Natsuki thought, if you knew it was a trap... all the more 
prepared you were to fight through it.

&quot;Ann. With me. We&#39;re going into the subway. The rest of you, stay up 
here,&quot; Natsuki ordered.

For however much Natsuki legitimately did not like Ann Lu, and she did 
not like her at all, the headmistress was not blind to her fighting 
ability. That was why, more than anyone else, Natsuki was most willing 
to have her as a teammate. When Ann joined her again, the pair dove down 
into the exposed subway and into darkness. There, the melancholy flute 
solo continue in a louder volume. The playing became more furious and 
frantic. Then, they saw her.

The young Mistress of Yatagarasu, staring back at them with those 
Nagi-like deceptive eyes that showed more age and history than the 
youthful body would have indicated. A smirk invaded the girl&#39;s face, and 
the platinum haired devil vanished back into the darkness. When Ann and 
Natsuki cautiously advanced, two gunshots were heard. Shields went up.

Ice shards slammed into Natsuki&#39;s defensive field, and she nearly hissed 
at the attack. The Mistress of Yafusa, as well! She&#39;d dealt with this 
bitch on her first day on Earth. This time Natsuki hoped to finish her 
off. She tossed her artillery into the air. &quot;Eject secondaries!&quot;

She caught the twin rapid fire pistols and raced forward with Ann. One 
voice stopped them. &quot;Yafusa! Fire flash cartridge!&quot;

A shell sailed by Natsuki&#39;s head and exploded several meters behind. The 
entire tunnel was lit up, and there stood Azumi and Yafusa. Yes, this 
was definitely familiar! Yafusa howled and lunged. Natsuki slid far to 
the edge of the subway tunnel to avoid the charge. The wolf then went 
after Ann, more aggressively. The stand-in Archmeister was able to avoid 
his attack and keep him at bay.

Natsuki, on the other hand, fired concentrated bursts of laser at her 
rival. Azumi rolled out of the way and fired back with those tiny ice 
pistols, sending shards right towards the Headmistress. Natsuki blocked 
them with a shield and rushed. She snapped a kick in the direction of 
Azumi&#39;s face, but it was avoided. The Ikusahime countered with more 
shots from her guns, which Natsuki evaded at high speed.

Azumi disappeared behind a row of columns on an old boarding ramp. 
Natsuki waited until Azumi poked her head out to fire, to obsessed with 
the hunt to deal with Ann or Yafusa. Then, when she saw her target, 
Natsuki fired wildly, cutting into the stone column as Azumi went back 
behind cover. When Natsuki paused, Azumi turned to the other side of the 
structure and fired back, narrowly missing the young leader of 
Garderobe.

An old fashioned gun duel. Azumi came out from behind cover again, and 
both held up their weapons and fired. Both girls weaved to the side, 
avoiding the shots. Natsuki blocked an incoming second shot, the ice 
shard shattering against the shield. Natsuki returned fire with her twin 
guns, but Azumi was skilled at naturally evading. She went behind cover 
yet again, and Natsuki found herself searing away much of the ancient 
architecture in an effort to hit any exposed part of the girl&#39;s body.

Having enough of this hide and go seek nonsense, Natsuki raced forward 
with her robe and skidded to a halt behind where Azumi was hiding. The 
headmistress threw a punch, which was blocked by the other female. She 
then attempted a knee and connected. Azumi doubled over, given Natsuki 
enough time to send another knee into her jaw. The Ikusahime fell 
backward, mouth bleeding. In a last ditch effort to strike out, she 
fired an ice pistol. It connected, Natsuki not having enough time to 
react at that range, and a shard sliced into her shoulder.

Natsuki grunted in pain and then kicked the gun out of her hand. Seeing 
her try the same with the second pistol, Natsuki slammed her foot down 
on the girl&#39;s wrist. Trapping her in place with that action, Natsuki 
knelt and picked up the silver weapon. Holding the lightweight pistol 
out towards her foe, she momentarily marveled at how light it was. A 
pleasant feeling, indeed. But business was at hand.

&quot;I want to know where Viola and her allies are,&quot; she demanded coolly.

&quot;Mars.&quot;

Natsuki gritted her teeth. She did not have time for smartasses. She had 
enough of that at Garderobe. She opened her mouth to question again, but 
noticed Azumi&#39;s eyes darting off to the side. What was she looking at? 
The headmistress turned her head and leapt back, seeing a blade sail 
right towards her head. The glaive hit the ground with a light spark, 
and Natsuki instantly recognized the face of the attacker.

&quot;Tomoe Marguerite,&quot; Natsuki grumbled. &quot;Shizuru is taking back former 
students to fight for her, is she?&quot;

&quot;Only the ones she fucked.&quot; A dirty little chuckle. Natsuki contorted 
her face into a snarl. The glaive sailed out again, and Natsuki managed 
to duck out of the way. Tomoe was a little faster than she would have 
been unaided. Natsuki focused in and saw a Diadem on her arm. Ah, so 
that was it. She had Heir blood in her and was given aid from the HiME 
devices. Wonderful.

Natsuki attempted a roundhouse kick, but it missed. Tomoe shoved her leg 
away with the shaft of her weapon. Recovering, Natsuki fell back into a 
fighting stance, ready to materialize her guns at any necessary moment. 
She heard Azumi scramble to her feet behind. Two against one, at least 
with Ann stuck with Yafusa.

Tomoe attempted to spear her, but Natsuki curved to the side and grabbed 
the weapon. Tomoe, temporarily stuck there, took the opportunity to 
taunt the veteran Otome. &quot;You know, Headmistress, I see why you like 
her. She did taste quite good.&quot;

That did it. Natsuki ripped the weapon out of Tomoe&#39;s grip and sent a 
powerful backhand right into her face. Unfortunately, she could not 
finish the little whelp off. Because there was Azumi. Ice shards again 
sailed through the air, and Natsuki ducked out of the way. At least, Ann 
raced up to join her, Yafusa temporarily stunned. The scythe cut through 
the air and out toward&#39;s Azumi&#39;s neck. The Ikusahime ducked back and 
then flipped to give herself some distance. Ann attacked again, and the 
girl jumped over it using her naturally enhanced muscles.

&quot;You damned whore,&quot; Tomoe spat, wiping blood from her nose. Despite her 
anger, she still found the desire to torment her. Perhaps to spread the 
love. &quot;So uncaring. No wonder she said you weren&#39;t any good in bed.&quot;

Tomoe then rolled out the way of a concentrated beam of energy supplied 
by one of Natsuki&#39;s secondaries. Whether Tomoe was suicidal or not was a 
matter of debate. Perhaps she hoped to get Natsuki so rattled that she 
messed up. The glaive was recovered and Tomoe rushed in to attack. She 
fell short, however, when a scream from further down the tunnel.

- - -

In the depths of Dammerung&#39;s main base, the Emulator became aware. All 
doors leading into the Emulator room were sealed off and locked by the 
computer systems, which suddenly seemed to have a mind of their very 
own. The ancient device prevented any Dammerung electronics expert from 
hacking into the system and opening the doors externally. Everything was 
locked down. The Emulator itself was in total control, having gone 
rogue. Or, rather, a much older program had taken over.

A massive golden symbol that both Searrs and the latter day Schwarz had 
used as their own appeared on the ground before the Emulator. Had anyone 
been allowed inside the room, they would have read the following on the 
machine&#39;s display:

EM-02 SFTGM

Orphan Materialization

Start

- - -

Tomoe, Natsuki and all those involved turned to see several HiME Heirs 
run right by them without so much as a second look. Something far worse 
must have been back there. Leucosia was last, her little legs carrying 
her as quickly as they could. She waved to Tomoe and Azumi. &quot;I can&#39;t use 
Yatagarasu in here! He&#39;s too big! Run!&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot; Azumi yelled.

&quot;Orphans!&quot;

Natsuki and Ann looked to each other for a moment while Tomoe stood in 
confusion. The green haired warrior was quickly taken away by Azumi, who 
didn&#39;t care to stick around. Like any good Otome, however, both Ann and 
Natsuki held their ground to see what all the fuss was about. Natsuki 
leveled not her secondaries, but her primary Element, down the tunnel. 
If it could cause the Ikusahime to run, she needed as much firepower as 
possible, right?

Emerging from the depths was a horde of beasts. These were not the metal 
Slaves they had been used to. These were flesh and blood monsters with 
fangs that were very real. Natsuki fired and blasted them back to hell, 
the force of the blast moving her back a few inches. Ann held her weapon 
at the ready, but logically suggested to leave. &quot;Perhaps it would be 
easier to deal with these things in not so confined quarters.&quot;

&quot;Agreed.&quot; Both turned and shot out of the subway at full speed as more 
of these &#39;Orphans&#39; spawned below.

Carla and Rosalie both approached. The latter spoke. &quot;What&#39;s going on? 
Why are the HiME all retreating?&quot;

&quot;Monsters just came up from the underground,&quot; Natsuki state. &quot;They 
aren&#39;t Slaves. They&#39;re different in composition. They&#39;re made of meat 
and blood, not wires and metal. I haven&#39;t seen anything like this 
before.&quot;

&quot;Did they appear like Slaves, or are they living creatures?&quot; Haruka 
asked from above.

&quot;I saw symbols. I believe they are similar to Slaves,&quot; Ann said. The 
first emerged from the tunnel. Haruka blinked and then went with her gut 
reaction. Charge! The blonde woman hacked open one of the purple skinned 
beasts using her new falcata sword. She was uncomfortable with it, but 
it got the job done. Ashura&#39;s GEM would take getting used to.

&quot;Definitely blood!&quot; Haruka confirmed. Another approached, and she was 
forced to dodge and incoming strike. Teeth lashed out at her body as if 
she were a food item. Another swipe of the falcata took it down.

&quot;More down that street!&quot; Shiho warned, pointing in the opposite 
direction. &quot;Ack! More there too!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a damned swarm!&quot; Haruka yelled. Natsuki&#39;s artillery cut off any 
other comments as she tried to sear as many as she could. When the blast 
subsided, the blonde was still talking. &quot;It&#39;s absurd!&quot;

And, without warning, their robes began to flicker. They rapidly dove 
down to avoid falling all together, and dropped completely when their 
robes vanished from view. Oh, absolutely fucking perfect timing. 
Natsuki, who had a single sidearm with eight shots, grouped everyone 
together and gave the order to head for safety. Upper levels of 
buildings seemed to be the ticket. They sprinted down the street without 
power. The small amount of juice left in their GEM provided radio 
communication.

&quot;Emulator is offline and unaccessible! It has cut us off! It&#39;s 
sentient!&quot; A panicked technician shouted. &quot;It&#39;s materializing these 
things. The core ran out of energy and passed out from the force!&quot;

&quot;Try to get back online if you can,&quot; Natsuki said. &quot;Break into the 
department using any force required to do so.&quot;

&quot;Garderobe has just called in!&quot; Another officer from Dammerung said. 
&quot;Same situation there! &#39;Your Emulator has sealed itself off! Both 
Emulators say they need eleven keys to open!&quot;

Dammit! What the hell was going on? Natsuki led the group through an 
alley and onward down the street, heading to a building that looked 
fairly sturdy. On the way, she could see Heirs fleeing the area, not 
paying much attention to them. Upon seeing the Otome uniforms, however, 
they all began to shout. But at least it was not attacking. It was angry 
and almost violent called &#150; a curse more than anything else.

&quot;You did this!&quot; They screamed. &quot;It&#39;s your fault! You started it over! 
This only happened when you showed up! Harbingers!&quot;

&quot;They haven&#39;t been here for over a thousand years! You did it!&quot;

They ran on, however, leaving the Otome to ponder the insane words. 
Natsuki, never the less, led her soldiers inside an empty building, 
where they hoped to wait things out long enough for the robes to come 
back online. Garderobe was facing the same swarms? Dammit, was Shinso 
offline too? She had to find some way to get in contact with them. She&#39;d 
need to head back to base. But that was miles away. First things first.

This was a plague, Natsuki thought. Monsters roamed the streets, and 
HiME Heirs were stuck fighting. Yatagarasu rained down attacks from the 
sky. The other great Children of the Ikusahime were out in full force. 
Yafusa blasted them down with silver and chrome cartridges. Ice pistols 
and bows fired projectiles out at the roaming monsters. Every available 
Ikusahime, and even that bitch Tomoe, fought against the beasts. After 
ten minutes, Natsuki&#39;s robe came back online. The rest soon followed.

&quot;Emulator came back online automatically,&quot; came the word.

Well, Natsuki thought, if nothing else... this would surely get the 
attention of her enemies and bring them back. In fact, that was perfect, 
wasn&#39;t it? She didn&#39;t have to lift a finger. Akane tapped her on the 
shoulder. &quot;Headmistress? What are our orders?&quot;

&quot;Return to Dammerung,&quot; she said.

Everyone looked baffled. Haruka, in particular, looked downright 
offended. &quot;What?!&quot;

&quot;We need to get in touch with Garderobe!&quot; Natsuki explained impatiently. 
&quot;I&#39;m not helping the HiME fend off these things. Your objective is to 
get back to Dammerung and defend it. Don&#39;t let any of these things in 
the perimeter of the base. Understood?&quot;

&quot;Y-yes...&quot; Akane muttered.

&quot;Good. Let&#39;s go.&quot;

All took to the high sky &#150; the snipers were otherwise occupied. Racing 
across Kyoto, they returned to the former Imperial Palace and took up 
defensive positions. The swarms hadn&#39;t yet reached that area of the 
city, but who knew how long it would be before the monsters tried to 
take over the whole place. Natsuki and Ann headed back inside, demanding 
status updates and information. The Emulator was still sealed off and 
not responding to any efforts to break in. The doors were resistant to 
explosive charges. Nothing like this had been expected or anticipated. 
They didn&#39;t know how to break into their own facility. Natsuki growled 
at that. How stupid!

They paused at video feeds from around the city. HiME Heirs and the 
Ikusahime were fighting against the things tooth and nail &#150; perhaps even 
harder than they had been fighting the Otome. Gennai and St. Vlas were 
attacking any creature in the area. The Mistresses of Yafusa and Tomoe 
were attacking the monsters directly. Dozens of battles were taking 
place at once. It was genuinely awesome in the original sense of that 
word.

&quot;Estimated number of these &#39;Orphans?&#39;&quot; Natsuki asked an officer.

&quot;Three thousand.&quot;

Ann whistled. Natsuki continued her interrogation. &quot;Have you ever heard 
the term Orphan before? Is it an Earth exclusive monster?&quot;

&quot;Never heard the term before in my life, ma&#39;am,&quot; he said. &quot;Those HiME 
seem to know something, though. Maybe it&#39;s a historical thing they have 
in their database. Theirs differs from ours a bit, so I&#39;ve heard. It&#39;s 
older.&quot;

A sigh. Natsuki got back to her original task. &quot;Get me Sara Gallagher at 
Garderobe.&quot;

A few communication officers went to work trying to establish contact, 
though they complained of a great deal of interference. Sara&#39;s voice 
eventually came over the lines. &quot;Natsuki?&quot;

&quot;Sara, what&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;Shinso-sama has completely sealed off the Mausoleum on her own accord,&quot; 
Sara began to explain. &quot;We can&#39;t get in no matter what we try. Irina&#39;s 
here hacking, I tried the key, but it was rejected, and Maria can&#39;t 
think of any other options. Other than maybe blasting the doors in, if 
we even could.&quot;

&quot;Have you noticed any Slave-like creatures in the area?&quot; Natsuki asked. 
&quot;Any reports of such things?&quot;

&quot;No, why?&quot;

&quot;Something weird is going on here. This Emulator spawned some... flesh 
and bone Slaves called Orphans. A lot of them. Perhaps Fumi doesn&#39;t have 
the same capacity, but keep your eyes peeled for any signs of Slave or 
Orphan activity around Windbloom and Garderobe. If Shinso-sama is 
effected by the same virus, or whatever the hell, both might have the 
same symptoms.&quot;

&quot;I understand. How unusual.&quot;

&quot;Apart from that, simply try to get into the Mausoleum any way you can. 
You have my authority to blow up some of the structure if necessary, as 
it is a national security, if not international, threat. Get Shinso-sama 
back to normal as soon as you possibly can,&quot; Natsuki ordered.

&quot;Will do, Headmistress. I&#39;ll report in if we have any further strange 
activity. The Guiding Star vanishing was weird enough as it is.&quot;

&quot;The Guiding Star is gone?&quot; Ann asked.

&quot;Witnesses said it turned red and then vanished.&quot;

&quot;Red?&quot; Natsuki looked back to Ann. &quot;It did that when the TGMS was 
activated, didn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;I have no idea what happened to it. Aries&#39; observatory has been 
scanning like mad, but it&#39;s still no where to be found.&quot;

At that, Natsuki paused. Overcome with curiosity, she panned one of the 
video feeds up until it faced the sky. She directed to the pale rising 
moon, and there she saw it. A faint red light. The Guiding Star. Most 
unusual, indeed. &quot;I see it. It&#39;s here, for some reason. It was a device, 
not an actual star. Perhaps it has some sort of travel capabilities. It 
was no doubt built from Earth materials, and the original colonists... 
so...&quot;

Ann squinted at the display of the ordinary moon. &quot;There&#39;s a star there? 
I do not see it.&quot;

Natsuki pointed quite clearly at what appeared to be a bright red star. 
How could Ann miss it? For someone so skilled and legendary, she wasn&#39;t 
terribly observant, was she? &quot;Right there.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s space.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see anything either,&quot; an officer added. Several more chimed in 
with a similar response.

&quot;Are you people nuts? Right there.&quot; She slammed her finger onto it 
again. She wasn&#39;t going insane, was she. It was clear as any other major 
star in the sky, if not more so. She couldn&#39;t have been imagining it. 
They just looked at her as if she were mad. Gritting her teeth, she 
tried to ignore the embarrassing and odd sensations. &quot;Whatever. Sara, 
keep me posted. Out.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Headmistress.&quot;

&quot;Miss Kruger?&quot; Someone else called. Now what? &quot;We have reports of 
multiple Children flying in from the west. People on the ground say they 
are your rebel soldiers.&quot;

Shizuru.

Well, Natsuki had been right. If nothing else, the Orphans would lure 
the Ikusahime back to Kyoto to inspect the chaos. And now, Natsuki could 
take them all back and set them straight. She would just have to beat 
some sense into those brainwashed fools. She watched as Ann tensed up. 
Ah, she did not want to fight Shizuru again, did she? No, Ann liked 
Shizuru far too much, and always had. Thus the source of Natsuki&#39;s 
hatred. Natsuki had not been Shizuru&#39;s first love. And, according to 
Tomoe, not the last, either.

Perhaps the beating would have to be a bit more than what was necessary 
when Natsuki met Shizuru again. She just could not help but feel 
overcome with that same rage as she had felt earlier. Was this jealousy? 
Or was this something foreign? It did not feel right, whatever it was. 
It felt like someone was being fed off of her bitterness and rage. But 
that was a silly notion, was it not? No, she was just stressed. That was 
why she was on edge.

She looked back at the feeds, and saw Shizuru leading the pack of 
Ikusahime flying in from China. Shizuru. You&#39;ll learn not to be so 
rebellious, even if I must force you into submission. You know you can&#39;t 
really fight me, my HiME.</pre>
