<h1>Strawberry Vengeance: The Wrath of Marimite!</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<pre>-Prologue-
 
Fukuzawa Yumi woke up in her bed and looked outside the window with a 
smile. The sun was shining, and there wasn&#39;t a cloud in sight. As birds 
outside sang, she quickly showered and got dressed, making sure to leave 
her scarf crookedly so that her beloved onee-sama, Sachiko, could 
straighten it for her when she saw her before classes.
 
As the bus dropped her off at the grounds of the Lillian Catholic School 
for Girls, she sighed happily as she closed her eyes and took a big 
breath of fresh air. It was then she first heard it.
 
The sounds of weeping.
 
All around her she could see her fellow students looking sad, weeping, 
and trying to comfort one another. As she continued to look around 
questioningly, she heard footsteps behind her.
 
&quot;Yumi-san,&quot; a voice called out. The young student of the Lillian 
Catholic School for girls turned around to see her friend and school 
newspaper photographer Takeshima Tsukano, along with the newspaper 
editor Tsukiyama Minako. Minako held a copy of the latest edition of the 
school newspaper.
 
&quot;Tsutako-san, Minako-san,&quot; Yumi asked, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;
 
&quot;You mean you haven&#39;t heard?&quot; Tsutako asked incredulously, &quot;They&#39;re 
going to close down Lillian.&quot;
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;It&#39;s true,&quot; Minako said gravely, &quot;From what my sources tell me, it&#39;s 
all because of some other girl&#39;s school convincing Bishop Takahashi to 
close our school down and keep theirs open.&quot;
 
Yumi looked around her again, at the old school grounds she&#39;d come to 
look at as a second home. She then ran for the mansion where the 
Yamayurikai members gathered, hoping it was all a lie. Her heart was 
beating rapidly as she finally reached the meeting room. Opening the 
door, she ran in breathlessly.
 
One look around at the sad faces confirmed the truth. She started to 
cry.
 
Sachiko saw Yumi come in, and went to comfort her (after she 
straightened her scarf, lectured her on how unladylike it was to run in 
on their meeting, and told her to pour her some tea).
 
&quot;How could this be happening?&quot; Shimako asked, &quot;Why would the Bishop 
choose to close down our school?&quot;
 
&quot;According to the school newspaper,&quot; Rei answered, &quot;It was because of a 
group of schools known as the Strawberry dorms.&quot;
 
&quot;Well, we can&#39;t let them get away with this!&quot; Rei&#39;s cousin Yoshino said 
angrily.
 
&quot;Really?&quot; Sachiko asked as she continued to hold her petit soeur Yumi in 
her arms, &quot;And what would you suggest?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what I suggest,&quot; Yoshino snapped back, &quot;I suggest that we 
cut classes and go to that other school to confront them, that&#39;s what!&quot;
 
-Chapter 1-
 
-Of Course You Know This Means War-
 
It was time once again at the Strawberry dorms for Etoile elections, and 
all the girls were eagerly assembled outside the large church in the 
center of the Strawberry dorms for the special announcements the Head 
Sister was about to make. Behind the podium where she would be speaking 
stood the three student council presidents, Chikaru, Toumori, and 
Miyuki.
 
As she waited for the old battleaxe... er... Head Sister to arrive, 
Miyuki frowned as she thought of recent events. Her idea of having Tamao 
and Shizuma share Nagisa by alternating days with her had failed 
miserably after the poor redhead had to be hospitalized for exhaustion. 
In a misguided attempt to put things right once and for all, she decided 
to use her authority to try to force Shizuma to give up Nagisa, and to 
make the cute young girl run with her roommate Tamao for the Etoile 
post. She tried to remind herself that it was for their own good, but 
somehow was able to find no reassurance in it.
 
Toumori was likewise unhappy. After pestering, conspiring, and playing 
dirty politics in ways that would&#39;ve given the late Richard Nixon a run 
for his money, she&#39;d finally convinced Amane to run for Etoile with 
Hikari. So what happens? The girl goes and falls off a horse on her! 
Toumori let out a frustrated sigh at how unfair life was to her.
 
Finally, Chikaru stood smiling out at her fellow students, trying to 
keep from bouncing up and down with joy over how proud she was of her 
friends Hyuuga and Natsume who were running together as St. Lulim&#39;s 
entry in the Etoile battle.
 
At last, the Head Sister came out to address the assembly, followed by a 
young novice nun no one in the crowd recognized.
 
&quot;Girls,&quot; the elderly nun announced, &quot;We are here of course to announce 
this year&#39;s candidates for the positions of Etoile. First though, I&#39;d 
like to introduce you all to a new member of the community who&#39;s joining 
us. This is Sister Kubo Shiori,&quot; she said, motioning to the smiling 
young woman in the nun&#39;s habit, &quot;And she will be here as a guidance 
counselor. Say hello everyone.&quot;
 
All the girls politely wished the nun good morning as they bowed to her. 
The young novice blushed a bit as she returned the gesture, and the Head 
Sister then continued.
 
&quot;And now, it&#39;s time for the Etoile candidates,&quot; the nun announced as all 
the girls cheered enthusiastically, &quot;First up, we have St. Spica&#39;s 
entry, Amane and Hikari.&quot;
 
The crowd applauded as Hikari came out, pushing Amane who was sitting 
cross-eyed in a wheelchair wearing a neck brace and a bib to catch her 
drool. Toumori rolled her eyes, reminding herself once again that the 
doctors said Amane&#39;s condition was temporary, and she should be back to 
normal any day now. As the applause finally died down, one of the 
students from St. Spica stepped forward.
 
&quot;Amane,&quot; she asked, &quot;There are some here who say you&#39;re now nothing but 
a vegetable after your horseback riding accident, and that Toumori and 
Hikari are trying to take advantage of your past glory to win the Etoile 
position for St. Spica. What do you have to say to such insensitive 
remarks?&quot;
 
&quot;I like cheese!&quot; Amane shouted. As the audience looked among one another 
in confusion and Hikari wiped some drool from Amane&#39;s chin, the Head 
Sister once again addressed the crowd.
 
&quot;Er... Moving right along, we have candidates Hyuuga and Natsume from 
St. Lulim,&quot; she said as the two girls now stepped forward, accompanied 
by Kagome and her teddy bear Ohshibaru. &quot;Girls,&quot; the Head Sister asked, 
&quot;Is there anything you&#39;d like to say to everyone?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes,&quot; Kagome answered on behalf of the two candidates, &quot;Ohshibaru says 
to vote for Hyuuga and Natsume, or else you will all be cast into the 
outer darkness where there will be much weeping and gnashing of teeth.&quot;
 
&quot;Riiiiiiight... Thank you,&quot; the nun said as she eyed the little girl and 
her teddy bear nervously, &quot;And finally, we have St. Miator&#39;s entries, 
Nagisa and Tamao, who...&quot; her voice died off as she saw a group of angry 
looking girls storming over in school uniforms that she was unfamiliar 
with. The novice Shiori, however, stifled a gasp as she recognized the 
sailor uniforms of the Lillian Catholic School for Girls.
 
&quot;Young ladies,&quot; the Head Sister said as she addressed the little group, 
&quot;May I help you?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sachiko answered as she stepped forward. The nun took a step back 
as the elegant young lady stepped up to the podium, accompanied by 
Shimako, Rei, Yumi and Yoshino, &quot;We&#39;re from a different Catholic school, 
Lillian.&quot;
 
&quot;Ut-oh,&quot; Toumori muttered under her breath, realizing what was probably 
coming next.
 
&quot;We are here because our school is being closed,&quot; Sachiko continued, 
&quot;And it is being closed because of certain members of your schools.&quot;
 
As the crowd started murmuring in surprise and shock at the accusation, 
Shimako came to the podium, &quot;We&#39;re not blaming anyone specifically,&quot; she 
tried to reassure in her soft, beautiful voice, &quot;But from what we 
understand the Bishop spared your school at the expense of ours. We...&quot; 
the refined young woman was cut off as Yoshino pushed her out of the way 
and took the mike.
 
&quot;Thanks to you creeps, we&#39;re loosing our school!&quot; she yelled, causing 
the crowd to become angry. Yumi instinctually moved closer to her 
onee-sama as she saw the annoyed looks directed towards her and her 
group. Meanwhile, Yoshino&#39;s cousin Rei went up to the podium.
 
&quot;Yoshino-chan,&quot; she interrupted, &quot;Let&#39;s not...&quot;
 
&quot;Stay out of this,&quot; Yoshino snapped back as a tall student of St. Miator 
stepped forward. &quot;And who are you supposed to be?&quot;
 
&quot;My name&#39;s Shizuma,&quot; the statuesque girl answered, adding, &quot;I can 
understand if you&#39;re angry, but our schools are in the middle of 
something at the moment. Perhaps when we&#39;re done, we can all sit down 
together and...&quot;
 
&quot;Humph,&quot; the irate Lillian student answered back, &quot;We don&#39;t want to wait 
until later, we want to get this out in the open now, so...&quot; her voice 
died off as two more students stepped forward, this time from St. Spica, 
&quot;And who are you two?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m Kenjou,&quot; the taller one answered, &quot;And this is Momori.&quot;
 
&quot;Listen,&quot; the shorter evil lesbian said, &quot;I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve 
noticed, but there&#39;s only five of you, and about four hundred of us.&quot;
 
&quot;What?&quot; Sachiko asked as she stepped back up to the podium, &quot;Are you 
threatening us?&quot;
 
&quot;Girl&#39;s,&quot; the Head Sister interrupted, &quot;This has gone far enough, I...&quot;
 
&quot;Have you girl&#39;s ever heard about General Custer?&quot; Kenjou asked, &quot;Or the 
building of the Suez Canal, or the second gunman who was hiding in the 
grassy knoll?&quot;
 
&quot;Huh?&quot; Yumi asked as she stepped up beside her grande soeur, &quot;What are 
you talking about?&quot;
 
&quot;Heh, what about Joan of Arc before the Church on trial for witchcraft?&quot; 
Kenjou continued, &quot;Or the assassination of Gandhi? Or the US 
government&#39;s faking of the moon landing, or the ability of amoeba to 
reproduce asexually, or...&quot;
 
&quot;Um, Kenjou hon?&quot; Momori whispered out of the corner of her mouth, 
&quot;Exactly what are you driving at?&quot;
 
&quot;Actually, I&#39;ve forgotten at this point,&quot; the taller evil lesbian 
admitted defeatedly.
 
&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; the Head Sister yelled angrily, &quot;We are in the middle of 
elections for a new Etoile. Now I&#39;m sorry your school is closing down, 
but these things happen. Now please leave, before I have you escorted 
out.&quot;
 
Yoshino was about to go back to the podium to answer back, but was held 
back by Rei who quickly covered her cousin&#39;s mouth to prevent further 
outbursts. Sachiko sadly took Yumi&#39;s hand and led her away, followed by 
Shimako and the others. As they left the campus, Sachiko spoke up first.
 
&quot;Was it just me, or did that young nun back there look familiar?&quot;
 
&quot;I couldn&#39;t tell,&quot; Shimako answered, &quot;I was focused a bit more on the 
mob of angry girls in front of us at the time.&quot;
 
&quot;We have to do something,&quot; Yoshino grumbled, &quot;We have to teach them a 
lesson.&quot;
 
&quot;I agree,&quot; Rei said, &quot;But what can we do?&quot;
 
&quot;We can come back tonight,&quot; Yoshino said, &quot;Late at night, when everyone 
is asleep.&quot;
 
&quot;And do what?&quot; Yumi asked.
 
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she admitted, &quot;But we&#39;ll have thought of something by 
then. I mean, we can&#39;t just let this go. Think of Lillian&#39;s pride. Who&#39;s 
with me?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;ll be,&quot; Rei answered.
 
&quot;Me too!&quot; Yumi cried, caught up in the moment.
 
Sachiko sighed, &quot;Well, if my petit soeur is going to join in whatever 
ridiculous stunt between the schools you come up with, I suppose I 
should join too.&quot;
 
&quot;Onee-sama,&quot; Yumi replied, &quot;Are you sure?&quot;
 
&quot;Of course I&#39;m sure,&quot; Sachiko reassured. She and the others then turned 
to Shimako, who let out a sigh.
 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;But I have a math test to study up for tonight, 
so I won&#39;t be able to go. However, I do know of someone who can help 
us,&quot; she added, pulling out her cell phone. She started dialing a number 
as a bus stopped in front of them.
 
-Later That Night-
 
&quot;Nagisa-chan?&quot; Tamao asked, &quot;The tea is almost ready for tonight&#39;s 
party. Is everything alright?&quot;
 
&quot;Of course,&quot; the redhead answered. This was a lie though; Nagisa&#39;s heart 
was being torn in two from lesbian angst between Tamao, whom she loved 
as a friend but who loved her as more than a friend, and Shizuma, whom 
she truly loved and who truly loved her. Unfortunately, Shizuma was 
friends with Miyuki, who thought she could solve everyone&#39;s problems by 
telling her to stay away from Nagisa so that the redhead could run in 
the Etoile elections with the girl she didn&#39;t love.
 
It should probably be noted that Miyuki once thought of taking up a 
career as a crisis counselor, helping out those in trouble from 
relationship problems and depression. She even went so far as to do 
volunteer work at a suicide hotline one summer during vacation. After 
she failed to convince even one of her two-hundred and eighty-nine 
callers not to kill themselves however, she quickly set the idea aside.
 
Of course, that didn&#39;t stop her from trying to meddle in Shizuma and 
Nagisa&#39;s lives.
 
But back to the story; Nagisa was feeling down (as she often did 
nowadays) and was trying her best to hide it (which was once again a 
common occurrence) as she finished setting up the tea cups and plates 
for their guests. She&#39;d been so busy in fact that, unlike her roommate 
Tamao, she hadn&#39;t changed yet into her pajamas.
 
&quot;Tamao,&quot; she asked, &quot;Are you sure it&#39;s alright for us to get together 
with Tsubomi, Yaya and Hikari again? I mean, we&#39;re running against 
Hikari in the election.&quot;
 
&quot;It&#39;ll be fine,&quot; she answered as their room temp Chiyo came in, 
&quot;Chiyo-chan, are you happy to get together for a tea party with everyone 
again.&quot;
 
&quot;Huh?&quot; the cute girl asked, &quot;Oh, yes. I&#39;ve been looking forward to it 
all day.&quot;
 
&quot;Chiyo-chan,&quot; Nagisa said, &quot;Did you ever find out what happened to you 
when we went to see the Bishop?&quot;
 
&quot;No. All I remember was getting on the bus, sitting next to a girl who 
was listening to a CD player, then the next thing I knew we were all in 
the Diocesan headquarters. The rest is a blank.&quot;
 
&quot;Well, don&#39;t worry,&quot; Tamao said as she began to help Nagisa set the 
table, &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll eventually... Ut-oh.&quot;
 
&quot;Tamao-chan, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Nagisa asked.
 
&quot;We&#39;re out of sugar,&quot; the bluette answered. &quot;Nagisa, you&#39;re still 
dressed. Can you sneak down into the cafeteria and try to get us some?&quot;
 
Nagisa smiled, &quot;Of course,&quot; she answered, &quot;Wait here.&quot;
 
------
 
 
 
The girls, each carrying a large bag, met up in the city at the 
pre-determined spot, and as a group headed out for the Strawberry dorms. 
As they strode through the city at night, they walked by a sad-looking 
woman with long, flowing dark-green hair wearing a fuku and carrying a 
long staff with an orb at the top of it and a cardboard sign. As Yumi 
got closer, she noticed that the sign read &quot;Will protect the space-time 
continuum for food.&quot; As she and the rest of the group left the woman 
behind them, she turned to Sachiko.
 
&quot;Onee-sama?&quot; Yumi asked, &quot;Who was that standing on the street corner? 
She looked familiar.&quot;
 
&quot;Didn&#39;t you hear?&quot; Sachiko answered back, &quot;They&#39;ve ruled that Pluto is 
no longer a planet.&quot;
 
A short time later, the girls all jumped the gate and ran to a large 
cherry tree outside the church shared by the three Strawberry dorms.
 
&quot;We&#39;ll teach those jerks!&quot; Yoshino whispered as Rei came up carrying 
both her own bag as well as that of her cousin in the pigtails, &quot;They 
won&#39;t get away with closing down our school,&quot; she declared as she 
reached into her bag and pulled out a roll of toilet paper, &quot;Operation 
`Tee-pee the Strawberry Dorms&#39; begins NOW!&quot;
 
&quot;Shhhh...&quot; Sei whispered as she put a finger up to her lips, &quot;You&#39;re 
going to wake up everyone.&quot;
 
&quot;Um, Sei-sama,&quot; Yumi asked, &quot;Why did you agree to come out with us? I 
mean, you&#39;re in college now and...&quot; the cute little girl was cut off as 
Sei pulled her into a hug from behind.
 
&quot;Hey, Lillian was my alma-mater; I have to defend the school&#39;s honor 
along with the rest of you, besides,&quot; she added as she brought her lips 
up to Yumi&#39;s ear and wrapped her leg around the girl, &quot;I couldn&#39;t say no 
to seeing you again, now could I?&quot;
 
&quot;Eeep! Sachiko-sama, help, I...&quot;
 
&quot;Yumi, how many times have I told you to call me onee-sama?&quot; Sachiko 
asked sternly, &quot;And keep your voice down.&quot;
 
&quot;Nggg... Sorry onee-sama, I...&quot;
 
&quot;He, he,&quot; Sei giggled, &quot;Watch this,&quot; she then proceeded to stick her 
index finger in her mouth, wet it, and then stuck it in Yumi&#39;s ear, &quot;Wet 
Willie, Wet Willie!&quot;
 
&quot;AAAAAAA!!!&quot;
 
&quot;Sei, that&#39;s enough!&quot; Sachiko said angrily as she glared at the pair, 
&quot;And Yumi, don&#39;t you know struggling like that while Sei-sama&#39;s 
dry-humping you only encourages her?&quot;
 
&quot;Nnnn... Sorry onee-sama...&quot;
 
&quot;Fine,&quot; Sei said as she finally let the hapless student go, &quot;Look, let&#39;s 
just teepee the jerks and get this over with.&quot;
 
&quot;My sentiments exactly,&quot; Rei whispered as she grabbed a roll of toilet 
paper, &quot;We&#39;ll start with the St. Miator dorm, then...&quot;
 
Suddenly the lights went on in one of the building, and an imposing 
looking old nun opened the front door.
 
&quot;What&#39;s going on out here?&quot; the Head Sister asked.
 
&quot;Beat it, it&#39;s the heat!!!&quot; Sei yelled, at which point all the assembled 
Yamayurikai members scattered into the night. As Sei ran in the darkness 
however, a figure in a nun&#39;s habit ran out of the St. Spica building and 
intercepted her.
 
&quot;Freeze!&quot; the young nun in the shadows shouted, &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s 
going on, but curfew was over three hours ago and...&quot; the nun&#39;s voice 
died off though as she got a better look at the young woman in front of 
her, &quot;Sei?&quot; she asked as she stepped out of the shadows into the 
moonlight.
 
&quot;Shiori!&quot; the other gasped, her usual carefree and humorous demeanor 
forgotten as memories of the past came back. For a moment, Sei seemed 
frozen, staring at the young novice as tears slowly formed in the corner 
of her eyes.
 
The sounds of the Head Sister, as well as the students of the Strawberry 
dorms now running out into the night, quickly brought her back to the 
present. As Shiori watched, Sei ran past her, wiping the tears from her 
eyes as she did so.
 
&quot;Damn it,&quot; she cursed as she ran into the woods surrounding the 
Strawberry dorms, &quot;Of all the Catholic girl&#39;s schools in all the Diocese 
in all the world, she had to be sent to this one!&quot;
 
Meanwhile, as all the chaos of the Lillian students, nuns, and students 
of the three Strawberry dorms running around blindly in the dark was 
taking place, Nagisa snuck out of the cafeteria with a small bag of 
sugar, greatly distressed by all the shouting and disturbance.
 
&quot;Oh no,&quot; she muttered, &quot;They must have found out I snuck out of my room. 
Head Sister will be mad at me again, and...&quot;
 
&quot;There you are!&quot; an anxious voice Nagisa didn&#39;t recognize said, &quot;I 
thought I&#39;d lost you!&quot;
 
Before the redhead could respond, a hand grabbed onto her wrist and 
dragged her off into the night.
 
Elsewhere, Yumi was cringing behind the cherry tree, trying desperately 
not to panic. She was scared for not just herself, but her beloved 
onee-sama as well. As she heard angry voices coming nearer, she felt a 
hand suddenly clutch at her arm.
 
&quot;Here you are!&quot; a sweet, concerned voice said, &quot;Forget the sugar; if you 
get caught we&#39;ll get in trouble again. Come on, let&#39;s get back.&quot;
 
As Yumi was pulled away, the group from Lillian managed to somehow all 
escape, meeting outside the school grounds.
 
&quot;Is everyone here?&quot; Rei asked breathlessly.
 
&quot;It looks it,&quot; Sei answered.
 
&quot;Wait just one minute,&quot; Sachiko said sternly as she eyed the girl whose 
wrist she was holding onto, &quot;This isn&#39;t Yumi.&quot;
 
&quot;What?&quot; Rei asked in shock.
 
&quot;Not Yumi?&quot; Yoshino blurted out as she narrowed her eyes at the 
stranger, &quot;Who are you? What have you done with Yumi? Why...&quot;
 
&quot;Everyone, calm down,&quot; Sei said, &quot;Can&#39;t you see she&#39;s already scared 
enough?&quot; the Lillian alumni then went over to the girl and smiled as she 
gently put a hand on her shoulder, &quot;Calm down, no one&#39;s going to hurt 
you. Who are you?&quot;
 
&quot;M... My name&#39;s Nagisa,&quot; the frightened redhead stuttered out, &quot;I... I 
was on my way to grab some sugar for a late-night tea party, when she 
grabbed my arm and dragged me here,&quot; she explained as she pointed at 
Sachiko.
 
Elsewhere...
 
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Tamao asked once she got the stranger into her room, &quot;And 
where&#39;s Nagisa?&quot;
 
&quot;My name&#39;s Yumi,&quot; the girl answered tearfully, &quot;And I want to go home.&quot;</pre>
