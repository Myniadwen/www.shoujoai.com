<h1>Shadowcat: Read or Die! (part 1 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This story starts off during the events of Mekanix #1 and sometime 
after the end of Read Or Die OVA #3. There are spoilers in here if you 
have not yet seen Read Or Die!


        Kitty Pryde wiped off the top of the bar at Belles of Hell 
with a smooth gesture even as she stylishly poured out a drink for the 
young man who&#39;s ID she had just checked. Since the brown haired woman 
had started her classes at MIT this job in the college town bar was a 
real life saver, helping give her some much needed financial 
independence while also getting her out of her head a bit, keeping her 
connected to a more ordinary kind of people.

        Talking with the customers, listening to their problems, the 
flamboyant bartending, Kitty had been a bit surprised at how easily it 
all came to her. Though being a former dance major should have given 
her a hint she could be that sort of performer. &#39;I wonder what Ororo 
would think if she saw me know?&#39; she thought to herself with a slight 
smile.

        Looking up as casually as she possibly could Kitty took in the 
quiet young woman who was wearing glasses and sitting over there in 
the corner. The black haired lady was still nursing her first drink, 
looking clearly nervous about something or other as she read from her 
book. Kitty had felt her watching her more than a few times tonight, 
and wasn&#39;t quite sure what to make of it.

        &quot;It looks like you&#39;ve gotten yourself an admirer,&quot; her slim, 
dark haired boss Dylan Maguire came up behind her to note with a sly 
grin.

        &quot;Maybe,&quot; Kitty blushed faintly before she tentatively asked 
him, &quot;Do you mind if I clock out early, check it out?&quot;

        &quot;Good luck,&quot; Dylan clapped her on the back, nearly knocking 
her over.

        &quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Kitty managed.

        With a single motion Kitty pulled off her apron and tucked it 
back behind the bar before reaching into the small fridge there and 
getting out a bottle of spring water to cool herself off a bit. She 
drank it down happily, her throat feeling a bit dry from talking so 
much, then she reached up to wipe off her brow with a towel.

        Kitty navigated her way through the dancing crowd, being 
careful not to bump or knock over any of the partiers who were all 
around her. &#39;Glad I&#39;ve had some practice at it,&#39; she thought. Safely 
reaching the corner table at last she smiled down at the woman, 
&quot;Hello.&quot;

        Clearly startled the black haired woman pushed up her square 
frame glasses and blurted out in what was clearly her native Japanese, 
&quot;Oh, hello.&quot;

        &quot;Is there something I can help you with?&quot; Kitty asked her also 
in unaccented Japanese. &#39;Hanging around Logan really pays off,&#39; she 
thought.

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; the young woman stood up and switched back to English 
to introduce herself, &quot;my name is Yomiko Readaman.&quot;

        &quot;Hello Yomiko,&quot; Kitty frowned just slightly, recognizing the 
name almost instantly. She had been exchanging casual emails with a 
Japanese school teacher named Yomiko for the last few weeks. &#39;Could 
this be her?&#39; she wondered. Getting a handle on her racing thoughts 
she smiled down at her and said, &quot;My name&#39;s Kitty.&quot;

        &quot;I know,&quot; Yomiko looked clearly uncomfortable as she gestured 
Kitty to the seat opposite her, &quot;I came here to see you.&quot;

        That remark made Kitty give Yomiko a much more cautious and 
assessing look. The young lady almost looked like the stereotype of a 
school teacher, with her brown vest, white shirt and black matching 
dress and tie. The only thing odd was her general scruffiness, with 
tuffs of her hair standing up and a look of distraction on her face.

        Making her voice sound much harder than normal Kitty said, 
&quot;You&#39;re the one I&#39;ve been exchanging emails with, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

        &quot;Hai,&quot; Yomiko nodded to Kitty. She hesitated, &quot;Could we talk 
somewhere a bit more private? It concerns... Shadowcat.&quot;

        &quot;Lets go outside,&quot; Kitty offered Yomiko her hand. She didn&#39;t 
intend to confirm or deny what the lady had just said. &#39;So all those 
emails weren&#39;t as casual as I thought,&#39; Kitty mused, then, &#39;I guess I 
should have worn a mask along with my costume more often.&#39;

        They walked along the street silently for a few moments before 
Yomiko quietly said, &quot;This is why I felt that I had to contact you, 
and now to come see you.&quot; She reached into her coat and Kitty tensed 
up, relaxing just a bit when she pulled out a simple brown envelope. 
She popped it open, spilling several pictures out that she handed over 
to Kitty.

        They young woman in the photo&#39;s looked eerily familiar to 
Kitty, despite her feeling sure that she had not met her before. The 
woman dressed in the tight black leather jumpsuit wielded a machine 
pistol in one shot, was looking impatiently at the camera in another 
for some kind of official picture and in the last one...

        In the last photo she was phasing through a wall.

        &quot;Who..?&quot; Kitty said softly.

        &quot;Nancy,&quot; Yomiko said softly, &quot;Nancy Mukahari.&quot;

        Kitty held up the photo&#39;s to a nearby street lamp and examined 
them closely, &quot;If they&#39;re fakes, they&#39;re near perfect ones.&quot;

        &quot;They are not faked,&quot; Yomiko said to Kitty intensely, &quot;I saw 
Nancy- san do some of those things right in front of me.&quot;

        Kitty nodded to herself thoughtfully, realizing that for some 
reason she believed this young woman. Trusted her, no, especially 
after those emails, but she did believe what Yomiko was telling her. 
She also knew why she thought that she recognized Nancy. Except for 
the hair color and a few other minor details, the two of them were 
nearly a perfect match.

        After a moment Kitty looked over at Yomiko thoughtfully to ask 
her, &quot;Nancy was some kind of clone, wasn&#39;t she?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Yomiko nodded firmly, &quot;the man who claimed he was her 
creator told me that she was a clone of Mata Hari. But once I found 
out about the similarity in your powers, and saw the physical 
resemblance...&quot; She trailed off.

        &quot;You want a blood sample, to confirm it?&quot; Kitty asked, hoping 
that it was that simple, but she rather thought it wouldn&#39;t be.

        &quot;No,&quot; Yomiko shook her head sadly, &quot;Nancy&#39;s dead.&quot;

        Kitty winced slightly. There had been an air of sadness about 
the girl from the beginning, and now she knew the cause of it. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry,&quot; she offered.

        Yomiko smiled sadly, &quot;I need your help, Kitty-san.&quot;

        Kitty found herself dreading what she was about to hear, but 
she just had to ask Yomiko, &quot;Help you with what?&quot;

        &quot;I know there&#39;s a connection between you and Nancy,&quot; Yomiko 
said softly. &quot;We were... very close, me and Nancy. I have to know what 
it was, who really created Nancy, both for her and my sake,&quot; she 
explained, &quot;and I need your help to do that.&quot;

        Yes, she really did not want to hear that. Kitty looked down 
at the photos again, and thought about what to do. If she bailed out 
on MIT right now, she didn&#39;t know if she could get back in. She was 
already on probation due to her fight with a bunch of mutant haters, 
she didn&#39;t need any more black marks on her record. But this Nancy... 
In an odd way, they might be family. This woman with the same powers 
and a startling resemblance to her, it might very well be her clone.

        Kitty looked at the patiently waiting Yomiko. &#39;She said they 
were close,&#39; she mused, &#39;but the way she&#39;s acting, she loved her.&#39; 
When Illyanna had reverted back to childhood, Kitty had felt the need 
to go see her, to confirm it with her own eyes and when she died Kitty 
had been there. It looked like Yomiko needed something like that, some 
kind of closure.

        With a soft sigh Kitty said, &quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; a suddenly beaming Yomiko clasped Kitty&#39;s hands 
in her own. &quot;I&#39;ve already booked a flight for Japan, we&#39;ll take off 
tonight,&quot; she said.

        &quot;Tonight?&quot; Kitty went pale, &quot;Wait a minute here! I...&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll buy you some extra sets of clothes when we get there,&quot; 
Yomiko said as she tugged on Kitty&#39;s hands to pull her gently forward.

        &quot;But I...&quot; Kitty tried, then sighed. &quot;Never mind,&quot; she softly 
muttered as they walked down the street together.
