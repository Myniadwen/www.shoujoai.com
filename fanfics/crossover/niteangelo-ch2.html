<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a>

<a href="../crossover/niteangelo-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Rolling with the fall, Irene &quot;Rally&quot; Vincent quickly got back on her 
feet, facing her opponent. &quot;Not bad,&quot; she said, smiling. &quot;Maybe next 
time you should aim first before attacking!&quot;

In England, hunting FREAKs was easy stuff; not as strong, although 
nastier. However, when facing a true vampire, which Rally was doing at 
the time, was different - they don&#39;t tend to fight fair, especially when 
facing another true vampire. &quot;Well maybe next time y&#39; should stand still 
an&#39; wait f&#39;r me t&#39; &#39;it you... traitor!&quot; he snarled, crouching for 
another attack.

&quot;You know, it&#39;s you and that other vampire&#39;s fault that you&#39;ve been 
preying on all those children. Then you probably wouldn&#39;t have called 
attention to yourself, then you wouldn&#39;t be in the fix you&#39;re in right 
now!&quot; Rally countered. Privately, though, she thought to herself, &#39;This 
is just great! I just happened to be running a little errand for Walter, 
and I run into the creep that&#39;s been killing all those kids - one who 
just happens to be a true vampire as well! This is just not my night!&#39;

PREVIOUSLY, A HALF-HOUR EARLIER...

It was the night before November 5, the holiday celebrated throughout 
England as &#39;Guy Fawkes&#39; Night&#39;, also known as &#39;Cracker Night&#39;, 
&#39;Fireworks Night&#39;, or &#39;Bonfire Night&#39;, when a plot to kill King James I, 
as well as the rest of Parliament, was foiled when a stash of gunpowder 
was discovered by Yeoman Warders while doing a search of the basement of 
the chamber of the House of Lords. The holiday got its name from one of 
the principle figures in the caper, a Catholic named Guy Fawkes, and 
since then by royal proclamation, the night the plot was foiled was 
celebrated by fireworks, burning effigies, as well as bonfires lit 
throughout the land. Also as a consequence of the events, Yeoman Warders 
from the Tower now search the Lords Chamber before each opening of 
Parliament.

The preparations for the next night was no different at the Hellsing 
manor, where a contingent of the Wild Geese were busy piling logs in a 
huge pile outside the mansion grounds. Inside, the kitchen was 
particularly busy. Moria Hedgley, who had friends in the Black Country, 
was putting the final touches on her interpretation of groaty pudding, a 
favored dish there. She planned to serve the dish, a mixture of beef, 
buckwheat groats, onions, leeks and beef broth, to the Geese, as well as 
candied apples she had made.

However, Walter C. Dolnez had a particularly annoyed look as he took out 
one of the containers that was sitting in the pantry and looked inside. 
&quot;Humph... now this certainly will not do,&quot; he said to himself, finding 
the contents nearly empty. Finding a waste receptacle, he threw the 
container inside and exited, avoiding the bustle.

As he made his way in the great room, he happened to see Rally ascending 
from the lower levels. &quot;Ah Miss Vincent,&quot; Walter began, &quot;just the person 
I&#39;d like to see.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Rally asked. &quot;What for?&quot;

&quot;I have encountered a particularly annoying problem and I was wondering 
if you would be the one to solve it.&quot; Walter then centered himself 
before continuing. &quot;With all the preparations going on here and since I 
am needed to supervise them all, I was wondering if you could drop over 
to the market and fetch me a good-sized bottle of black treacle.&quot;

&quot;Black treacle?&quot; Rally repeated, confused.

&quot;Yes, I was getting ready to bake my recipe for parkin cake for tomorrow 
night and found we were out. I already have the flour, oats, butter and 
ginger, but had neglected to buy more for tomorrow night. I suppose it 
was used in making black toffee last week,&quot; Walter explained. He then 
got out his wallet and handed the dusky vampire at least &pound;10 in bills. 
&quot;Now this should cover the amount for at least 2 liters of black 
treacle. Feel free to keep any change for your trouble.&quot;

Rally was still confused. &quot;Walter... what&#39;s black treacle?&quot; she asked.

&quot;It&#39;s a dark syrup, made from what&#39;s left over from processing raw 
sugar, and is used in most baked goods,&quot; Walter explained. All he got 
from Rally was a questioning look. &quot;It is also called molasses,&quot; he 
added dryly.

&quot;Ohhh!&quot; Rally said, catching on. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you say so?&quot;

&quot;I believe I DID,&quot; Walter answered, looking annoyed.

Rally blinked, seeing the old butler&#39;s mood. &quot;Hey take it easy, Walter,&quot; 
she said, holding up her hands defensively, &quot;there&#39;s no need to go 
medieval all over me! I&#39;ll drop by the store, get your treacle and get 
back as soon as I can.&quot; Her mood changed slightly as she added, &quot;And 
besides, I wanted to see if I can get any clues about that vampire that 
killed and turned those kids... you know, the ones me, Moria and Master 
had to take down.&quot;

&quot;Oh yes, about that tragic bit of news,&quot; Walter said, &quot;how are you 
coping with that?&quot;

Rally was silent for a bit. &quot;I&#39;ll recover,&quot; was all she said as she 
walked through the door.

XXX

Twenty minutes later, Rally found herself walking home, a plastic sack 
in her hands. &quot;Hope this is Walter&#39;s favorite brand,&quot; she said to 
herself. &quot;I still like to know what parkin cake is. I can ask him at 
least.&quot;

However, Rally couldn&#39;t help but to notice that she was being followed. 
&#39;It&#39;s gotta be him,&#39; she thought, not turning around. &#39;Let&#39;s see if I 
can lure him in.&#39;

She maintained her course back to the mansion, never letting-on that she 
noticed. Then she heard the sound of breaking limbs and spun-around to 
counter. Stopping in his tracks was a man, apparently in his early &#39;20, 
with tattered clothing and a fierce look in his blood red eyes. &quot;I&#39;ve 
&#39;eard from me late master th&#39;t there was a company th&#39;t uses vampires to 
go &#39;unting other vampire, an&#39; looks like I was right. Y&#39; wouldn&#39;t &#39;appen 
t&#39; be one o&#39; th&#39; &#39;Ellsing Organization&#39;s pet vampire, now willya?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m nobody&#39;s pet, bucko!&quot; Rally shot back. &quot;No one owns me; I serve the 
Hellsing Organization out of obligation!&quot; Her face then betrayed a smirk 
as she added, &quot;You must be one of the vampires that have been killing 
children in these parts. I know Alucard had took care of one of them, 
and from what you&#39;ve told me, you must be the one that got away!&quot; She 
then set down her bag, crouched-down and motioned the vampire towards 
her. &quot;So how about it - wanna tussle?&quot;

And so for the next five minutes, the two vampires were at it, neither 
gaining ground. Hoping for an edge, Rally shifted to her more 
nightmarish form - her skin going to a slate-gray, her normally short 
hair growing waist long, her fingernails growing long claws, and all the 
teeth in her mouth becoming sharpened. Screaming, she lunged forward, 
with the other vampire engaging her in a &#39;test of strength&#39;, both their 
hands tightly clasped. &quot;Now I know you&#39;re new at this!&quot; Rally snarled. 
&quot;You don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re really capable of if you&#39;re still in 
your normal form!&quot;

&quot;Well I can tell y&#39; I&#39;m more than a match f&#39;r you, you traitor bitch,&quot; 
the other vampire spat back.

&quot;OH YEAH!?!?&quot; And with that, Rally pulled backwards and began spinning 
the other vampire around, catching him off-guard. With herself as the 
center, she twirled the offender around faster and faster. When she was 
satisfied with the speed she gained, she released her opponent - who 
screamed when he found himself impaled through the heart on a bare tree 
limb.

Taking some time to recover, Rally reverted to her normal form, then 
turned to a clump of bushes covered in shadow and said, &quot;You know you 
could&#39;ve given me a hand, Alucard. Then maybe I wouldn&#39;t have wasted so 
much time with him.&quot;

&quot;Now why would I do that, Rally Vincent?&quot; purred the No-Life King, who 
seemed to melt-out from the shadows. &quot;You were doing so well, I thought 
that, if I helped, I would ruin your fun.&quot; He then stopped in front of 
Rally and added, &quot;And besides, I figured that it would be therapeutic, 
ridding yourself of all that guild from earlier.&quot;

Rally sighed, her face with a sad smile. &quot;I hate it when you&#39;re right, 
you know,&quot; she said. Turning back, she walked back to the impaled 
vampire, who was still writhing on the limb. &quot;I had to let it out 
somehow.&quot;

Rally&#39;s opponent, still conscienous, just glared at her, then at 
Alucard. &quot;Y&#39; w&#39;re th&#39; one th&#39;t killed me master, y&#39; bloody bastard!&quot; he 
growled. &quot;So, are y&#39; &#39;appy, &#39;Ellsing bootlicker? Y&#39; must enjoy bein&#39; th&#39; 
tamed pet of th&#39;t stuck-up bitch Sir &#39;Ellsing!&quot;

&quot;Shut your mouth, insolent pup!&quot; Alucard snared, producing the Jackal 
from his red trenchcoat and aiming it at the offending vampire. &quot;You&#39;re 
in no position to make insults!&quot; Satisfied, he turned to Rally and said, 
&quot;Do me a favor and get rid of this false giant!&quot;

Rally nodded, reaching for her CZ-75 within the shadows of her jacket. 
Then she hesitated. &quot;Wait a minute... I&#39;ve got a better idea, Alucard.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Alucard implored, raising an eyebrow. &quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Oh I&#39;ll tell you... as soon as I make sure this asshole,&quot; pointing with 
her head to the vampire, &quot;doesn&#39;t listen in... at least until I want him 
to hear.&quot; Then concentrating hard, she telepathically made her 
suggestion to the No-Life King. The other vampire tried to listen-in 
with his mind, but Rally had established a locked message, for Alucard&#39;s 
mind only.

For a few minutes, the red-clad vampire did nothing. Then a big, evil 
smile came across his features. Then he laughed - a long, loud, 
terrifying laugh that caused the impaled vampire to cringe. &quot;Brilliant, 
absolutly brilliant!&quot; Alucard crowed. &quot;I love the way you think, Rally 
Vincent!! Yes, he&#39;ll make a splendid addition to tomorrow&#39;s events!!!&quot;

&quot;Uh... wot are y&#39; talkin&#39; about?&quot; the other vampire asked uneasily.

&quot;Oh you&#39;ll find out,&quot; Rally enigmatically said, producing a roll of duct 
tape from her coat. &quot;First, we have to make sure you don&#39;t pull that 
branch from your heart.&quot;

Alucard then walked over and picked-up the bag Rally had set down 
earlier. &quot;At least Walter will get his groceries for tonight, albeit a 
few minutes late.&quot; He peered into the bag and added, &quot;And his favorite 
brand, too.&quot;

&quot;Why thank you,&quot; Rally replied as she began to bind the other vampire&#39;s 
hands.

XXX

To be sure, the arrival of Rally and Alucard caused quite a stir within 
the Hellsing mansion, the No-Life King holding Rally&#39;s purchases, and 
Rally with the rogue vampire slung across her shoulders. When the guard 
post reported what happened, many of the Wild Geese dropped what they&#39;re 
doing and took up positions at the sides of the two, all armed. However, 
Rally didn&#39;t seem that all alarmed. &quot;Hi guys,&quot; she cheerfully said. 
&quot;Sorry I&#39;m late.&quot;

&quot;To say the least,&quot; Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, who had 
Walter, Moria and Seras Victoria at her side, replied, meeting the two. 
&quot;Just what exactly happened?&quot; she demanded.

&quot;I ran into the other vampire that killed those kids,&quot; Rally said. 
&quot;Walter, Alucard has the treacle I bought.&quot;

&quot;Yes, so I see,&quot; Walter said, still eyeing Rally and her burden.

&quot;But Rally,&quot; Seras said, &quot;why haven&#39;t you destroyed that vampire you&#39;re 
carrying?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Explain yourself,&quot; Sir Integra said firmly, casting Rally a 
disapproving stare.

&quot;Now don&#39;t be too hard on her, my master,&quot; Alucard said. &quot;This parasite 
will be dealt with accordingly - but in the manner Rally Vincent 
suggested to me.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Sir Integra replied, her eyebrow raised. &quot;Care to enlighten me 
on this?&quot;

Rally glanced over to the vampire she was carrying, then dropped him to 
the ground. The branch was still in his heart, but the ends had been 
broken off. Both his hands had been bound in duct tape, and the same 
substance was wrapped around his eyes. &quot;I guess it&#39;s alright if he knows 
what he&#39;s going to be facing,&quot; she said, walking up to the Hellsing 
leader. She then related her plans for the prisoner to Sir Integra, who 
smiled approvingly.

The rogue vampire, on the other hand, had a look of object terror on his 
face.

THE NEXT NIGHT...

Aerial fireworks were going off around the parameter of the Hellsing 
mansion as the night&#39;s festivities gotten underway. All around the 
roaring bonfire, several of the Wild Geese were throwing foil-wrapped 
potatoes at its base as others feasted on the steaming pot that Moria 
was serving to them. Walter had finished his parkin cake and placed it 
on a table that was set on the mansion grounds.

Sir Integra had strolled next to her butler, taking in the festive 
atmosphere. &quot;You know,&quot; she told Seras, who was walking besides her, &quot;I 
had serious doubts that Rally&#39;s idea might not work - until Alucard had 
noticed a rather embarrassing omission to the night&#39;s events.&quot;

&quot;Well Rally was mindful about tonight when she brought up the subject to 
Master,&quot; the Draculina offered. &quot;Then you made your suggestion and it 
solved everything.&quot;

&quot;And I must admit,&quot; Moria added, glancing across the grounds, &quot;it is 
rather stunning.&quot; The rogue vampire was a good distance away from the 
bonfire. His forearms were stiffened with a section of 2x4, his person 
now dressed in a facsimile of the garb of Father Alexander Anderson, 
right down to the cardboard bayonets taped to his hands. A length of 
chain was slung around both armpits and he was hung from a pole stuck 
into the ground and his body was drenched in paraffin oil. &quot;With all the 
preparations for tonight, no one ever thought to put together a effigy 
to burn.&quot;

&quot;Y&#39; BLOODY BASTARDS!!!&quot; the vampire yelled, his eyes still covered. &quot;I 
HOPE ALL OF Y&#39; GO TO &#39;ELL!!!&quot;

&quot;But then again,&quot; Sir Integra observed, &quot;an effigy does not usually 
elicit retorts the way this one does.&quot; She then walked up to the vampire 
and said, &quot;We could have thrown you in the bonfire, like Rally 
originally suggested, but I was afraid that our infirmary would be 
filled with men who wanted to have their stomachs pumped-out because 
your taint had contaminated their jacket potatoes. So yell all you want 
- it will be all for naught.&quot;

Sir Integra then took a small torch and lit it from the bonfire. She 
then handed it to Rally, who for most of the night was staring at the 
vampire. &quot;Rally,&quot; the Hellsing leader said, &quot;I believe the honor of the 
highlight of this night should fall to you.&quot; She then leaned over and 
whispered, &quot;Believe me, it will be extremely therapeutic if you do.&quot;

Rally didn&#39;t say anything, only taking the torch from Sir Integra. She 
then closed the distance between herself and the rogue vampire, whose 
struggles intensified. He could hear the crackling of the fire on the 
head as he spat, &quot;Y&#39; bitch! Y&#39; rather side wit&#39; the &#39;umans than yer own 
kind!&quot;

&quot;&#39;My own kind&#39;?&quot; Rally countered bitterly. &quot;Because of you and your 
master, I had to clean-up the mess you two had left - which was worse 
because they were children!&quot; Her features softened, although her 
audience couldn&#39;t see it. &quot;Do you know how hard it is to shoot kids, all 
because they had been turned to vampires against their will? I 
remembered the last one I killed... he was only 5 years old, and both 
his parents were killed before he was turned!&quot; A single bloody tear 
streamed across her face as she added, &quot;He asked me if I would take him 
to heaven where his mother and father was.&quot; Her voice cracked, &quot;And I 
did it!&quot;

&quot;As if I bloody care!&quot; the rogue vampire scoffed. &quot;Y&#39; bitch... an&#39; th&#39; 
rest of yer lot... y&#39; all go to &#39;ell!&quot;

Rally then touched the torch to the vampire&#39;s feet, and felt the 
satisfaction of hearing him scream in pain as the flames consumed his 
body. &quot;You first,&quot; she whispered, a grim smile gracing her face.
