<a href="../crossover/jetiendo-ch32.html">Back to Part 32</a><pre>Ash and May walked onto the pier, they starred at the sun at the end of 
the pier, holding hands, May fell on some banana skin and screamed and 
fell off dragging Ash with her. They landed on a purple yacht the size 
of a ship, which sailed around the beach. As they both got up they 
noticed Ant and Dec taking their class to the seaside.

&quot;THERE&#39;S THE ENGAGED COUPLE&quot; Ant roared.

&quot;NICE BOAT&quot; Dec roared

Ash and May waved at them, then they turned around, Jade Radcliffe,

&quot;Hello&quot; Jade said

&quot;Hi&quot; May said as Ash fell out the boat and was in the sea, May jumped 
into the sea. They both landed on the beach. The students all sunbathed; 
meanwhile Mr Grady&#39;s class was also sunbathing. Expect Matt who ran up 
to Ant and Dec&#39;s class shouting rude words

&quot;Fucking hell, shit, that bicth, Davis is a bastard, a fucking bastard, 
Jun, please fuck off, piss off&quot;

&quot; Matt&quot; TK asked politely&quot; what&#39;s the problem

&quot; Fucking Jun Motomiya&quot; Matt snarled, &quot; She&#39;s here oh shit&quot;

&quot; My cousin&#39;s here&quot; Ash thought as he looked for Jun.

&quot;JUN&quot; Ash shouted out

Jun dashed to Ash in a hurry.

&quot; Hi cousin&quot; Jun screeched,

&quot; How come I didn&#39;t see you in the train?&quot; Ash asked

&quot; Well,&quot; Jun smiled &quot; Matt tricked me but I forgive him. 
SoAshhowareyouiheradyouwheremarriedsoiwenttoJetiendoasfastasicouldtoseeyoua 
ndyourFiance&quot;

&quot;John&quot; May laughed, Jun was a little offended

&quot; May&quot; Ash whispered, &quot; it&#39;s Jun, it rhymes with fun&quot;

&quot;Ok&quot; May replied to Ash then went to Jun &quot; sorry Jun, can I asked you a 
question do you know what a comma is?&quot;

&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Jun giggled

&quot; It means pause while you are talking, you talk too fast&quot; Ash said as 
all three where laughing.

&quot;I have to say you are hilarious, John, I mean Jun &quot; May replied.

Jun laughed along with them.

&quot; SHIT, MOTHER FUCKER, BLOODY, WANKER, BICTH, BASTARD, HAUL, ASS, 
ASSHOLE, SODS FUCKING BASTARDS SHIT HOLY BUGGER,&quot; Matt whispered

&quot; Hey&quot; Tai giggled, &quot;You&#39;re Turing into Mr Paki,&quot;

&quot; It&#39;s pronounced Paykei&quot; Izzy said in an Asian accent.

&quot; We do not swear guys,&quot; the deep voice of Mr Grinal snarled.&quot; You 3 got 
detention&quot;

The three where embarrassed.

&quot;Shut up&quot; Izzy replied

&quot;Change your tone&quot; Mr Grinal boomed at him

&quot;Put a smile on your face Mr Grimsdale&quot; Tai smiled

&quot;Jesus loves you&quot; Matt joined in

Mr Grinal walked away muttering &quot;fucking hell&quot;

Meanwhile Kari&#39;s heart was breaking, she loved Misty but she had no 
confidence what so ever to dump TK or tell anyone else she was pregnant. 
She walked away from the crowds; Misty went over to her,

&quot; I think you should tell TK,&quot; misty whispered

Kari doesn&#39;t know why but Misty always gave her a boost of confidence.

&quot;I don&#39;t have the nerve&quot; Kari replied, &quot; how can I, people will think im 
a slut.&quot;

&quot; Kari&quot; Misty replied, &quot; allowing Kari&#39;s head rest on her shoulders, &quot; 
Don&#39;t suffer like this, I&#39;ve suffered like this, it&#39;s terrible, I don&#39;t 
want that happening to you, &quot;

&quot;Anyway, they&#39;d reject me if they found out about us&quot; Kari gasped.

&quot; You&#39;ve still got me, &quot; Misty smiled &quot; no matter who rejects you&quot; Misty 
touched Kari&#39;s mild bump,

Kari went to TK,

&quot;TK can we talk alone?&quot; Kari asked him desperately

&quot;Sure&quot; TK answered with the usual happy smile, as they both walked away 
from the crowd.

&quot;There&#39;s something I gotta tell you&quot; Kari gasped, reminding her self to 
breathe, as Misty went behind Kari,

&quot;Tell him&quot; Misty hissed

&quot; Tell me what,&quot; TK asked in bad way, &quot; hurry up about it&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m pregnant!&quot; Kari mouthed.

&quot;PREGNANT!&quot; TK cried happily, &quot;mine?&quot;

&quot; Who else&#39;s baby do ya think I&#39;m carrying?&quot; then for a joke &quot;Michael 
Jackson&#39;s&quot;

&quot;Oh my god&quot; TK as he hugged Kari,

&quot;I&#39;m 3 and a half months pregnant,&quot; Kari confessed as she looked at 
Misty with a huge relief,

&quot;It took you that long just to tell somebody?&quot; TK asked joy filling his 
face.

&quot; I didn&#39;t recognise I was pregnant until Christmas Day&quot; Kari panted. TK 
dashed to Matt, I excitement as Kari went back to Misty, &quot;bloody hell&quot; 
Kari reacted as she hugged Misty with relief, &quot;thank you so much, I love 
you so much&quot;

They where about to get close, until Ash and May turned at them, okay 
just pretend you don&#39;t know a thing.

&quot; Misty&quot; Ash shouted out in a shock, as Misty swung as she let go of 
Kari, trying not to blow their lesbian cover,

The four greeted each other as if they had stammer, until TK, Tai and 
Matt

&quot;See you lot later&quot; Ash breathed as he and May left,
