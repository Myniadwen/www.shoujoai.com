It&#39;s the end, thank God. If you&#39;ve read this far, I thank you for 
trudging through this without complaint.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I thought that the weight of her against my body was something I was 
dreaming. In the dark I didn&#39;t want to risk opening my eyes just in case 
I really was dreaming. Instead I tightened my arms around her, pulling 
her closer to me. Her soft groan at the sudden movement finally makes me 
take the risk.

She is still there, sleeping contently, nestled into the crook of my 
shoulder. Finally I break my eyes away from her sleeping face and look 
around at the strange surroundings. Shizuma&#39;s apartment. I look next to 
the clock, five fifty-three am.

As gently as possible I slide out of her arms, successful at not waking 
her up. I find my scattered clothing and slip it back on. I take a 
moment to brush Miyuki&#39;s hair from her face before laying a kiss on her 
forehead. It strikes me to leave a note and for a moment I feel as 
lovers must. Though I suppose that&#39;s what we are now after last night.

I stumble out the front door a few minutes later and pull out my cell 
phone to call Sei. She doesn&#39;t pick up the first time, but I try again 
as I walk down a flight of stairs to the street.

&quot;I&#39;m almost there, calm down woman,&quot; Sei says as she answers the phone 
just before hanging it back up.

Some manners she has today.

A few mintues later her beetle comes tearing down the street and stops 
next to me. Sleepily I climb in and shut the door without even greeting 
her. She sticks the car back in gear and heads towards Eriko&#39;s house, 
more than happy to be helping me out despite her lack of sleep.

&quot;What about Sachiko? We&#39;re fucked if she goes home,&quot; Sei says finally.

&quot;She won&#39;t. I&#39;ve asked Shizuma to handle it,&quot; I reply.

She nods but doesn&#39;t say anything else. It doesn&#39;t take long for us to 
get to Eriko&#39;s family home and I call her from the car, not wanting to 
disturb anyone inside the house. &quot;I&#39;ll be out in just a minute,&quot; she 
answers automatically.

Really what is with this grumpy bunch this morning?

A few minutes later she is piled in the beetle with us and we head to 
Sei&#39;s school. I can&#39;t help but feel as if we are some sort of rebel 
delinquents about to unleash all hell upon the world. The thought 
actually makes me giggle, yes giggle, which Sei and Eriko have no 
problem teasing me over.

Sei leads us to the photography lab and thanks to Eriko&#39;s studies at art 
school she is able to develop some very interesting pictures she took of 
Sachiko and Shizuma dancing last night. We make sure to have her develop 
doubles of them, just in case.

Next we head to the newsroom where once again Sei has pulled through for 
us and had some of her friends that she trusted implicitly meet us. They 
were more than eager to help us out, especially if it meant getting to 
see pictures of Sachiko herself letting loose. By the time they had 
worked their magic we had one copy of the Lillian paper with a special 
added article ready to out Sachiko with a very scandalous picture of her 
kissing Shizuma on the front page. Making sure it was the only one 
printed we gave our thanks and were ready to move on.

&quot;Do you have the contract?&quot; Eriko asked as we all packed back into Sei&#39;s 
vehicle.

&quot;If you could call it that, yes. Don&#39;t worry I haven&#39;t left any room for 
this to go wrong. He will sign off on each point, you two will be 
witnesses and he may have his own should he choose. He will take this 
seriously, because I am going to put his whole career on the line.&quot;

&quot;And this will hold through in court if he tries to fight it?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Don&#39;t worry, I have learned something at school,&quot; I say with much 
more confidence then I am feeling.

By the time we arrive at the Ogasawara residence it is well into the 
morning and I have prepped myself as well as I can for what I am about 
to do. The butler who answers the door recognizes us from our many 
visits to the house. After explaining that Sachiko hasn&#39;t returned home 
yet we inform him that we are here for her father, and he is more than 
willing to rush off to find the man of the house.

He returns quickly with not only Sachiko&#39;s father, but Suguru as well.

&quot;You&#39;ve kidnapped my bride!&quot; he says as he holds a hand to his heart.

&quot;You can&#39;t kidnap someone who goes willingly,&quot; Sei says with a sneer in 
his direction.

&quot;Mr Ogasawara I think we have a few things to discuss, if you don&#39;t 
mind,&quot; I say.

&quot;Yes of course. Is my little Sachiko alright?&quot; he asks without a trace 
of real concern in his voice.

&quot;I think we may want to have this conversation somewhere more formal.&quot;

&quot;Yes, of course. Forgive my rudeness,&quot; he says flatly.

He leads us to a wing of the house that we have never been in before. 
This is clearly his own personal area. Suguru follows, for which I find 
that I am glad. Having an additional witness within the family can only 
help us.

We end up in a large office and he takes a seat behind his sturdy wooden 
desk. Suguru stands at his side and the three of us stand in front of 
the desk, ready to lay ourselves on the line for our friend.

&quot;Sir, you do realize that Sachiko has no desire to be married to him,&quot; I 
say as I glance in Suguru&#39;s direction.

&quot;Then I think perhaps you do not know my daughter well. She was raised 
to serve this family and will happily take his hand in marriage.&quot;

His disregard for Sachiko&#39;s feeling puts all of us on edge but even Sei 
who I would expect to jump to Sachiko&#39;s defense is quiet. I glance at 
her and she nods, telling me that I am the leader without words. &quot;I&#39;m 
afraid you don&#39;t know your daughter very well, sir. We are here today to 
ask you to change your mind about forcing her into an unhappy marriage.&quot;

&quot;I will not. That is her role in this family and she will do what I ask 
of her or she will not be a part of this family.&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;m afraid you leave me no choice,&quot; I reply. I pull out the 
paperwork that I had typed up and lay it in front of him. I give him a 
minute to read through it and wait for what I am about to hit him with 
to dawn on him.

&quot;I suppose you have an ace up your sleeve to think that I would ever 
agree to any of this,&quot; he says finally.

The grin that spreads across my face cannot be stopped. I have waited 
for this moment for a long time. &quot;Of course I do sir.&quot;

Sei takes her cue and tosses the pictures of Sachiko and Shizuma onto 
the desk, sucessfully outing Sachiko to her family. She will have to 
forgive us for that later. Suguru lets out a whistle as he looks at the 
pictures, obviously finding them amusing.

&quot;Pictures don&#39;t scare me. With all the computer programs out there these 
days it&#39;s possible to do anything. You&#39;ll have to do better then that.&quot; 
He smiles as he looks into my eyes and I want to spit in his face. How 
can he really be enjoying this so much?

&quot;Actually we do have more,&quot; Eriko says as she lays down the article we 
made up.

He reads the article, which of course we made up, about how Sachiko is 
happy to finally be able to show her true self. He still isn&#39;t 
convinced, not until Sei explains to him that a phone call is all it 
takes for every major newspaper in Japan to pick up on this article.

&quot;I wonder how many people will be willing to invest in a company that is 
run by a man who can&#39;t even control his own daughter. Doesn&#39;t sound like 
a very safe bet to me,&quot; I challenge him. For the first time in my life I 
am happy for the strong sense of traditionalism in the old dirty men of 
Japan.

&quot;And if I fund Sachiko&#39;s school and living costs for four years, she 
will absolve herself from the family and my name and reputation will 
stay clean?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;And what do I get if she breaks her end of the bargain?&quot;

&quot;As you can see here she has signed her end of the contract. If anything 
should come to damage your reputation or business she will have to pay 
back every penny you have given her from this day forth. As you can see 
it has been notarized and will hold up in any court of law.&quot;

&quot;I think you should agree,&quot; Suguru speaks up. &quot;It&#39;s not as if I will 
have any trouble finding another suitable bride.&quot; He winks at us and I 
relax finally. I always knew I liked him for a reason, even if Sachiko 
didn&#39;t.

&quot;Well this is all going to be yours soon, Son. But I think you&#39;re right, 
it&#39;s better to not take a chance and risk losing more money then we 
need. And I don&#39;t want such a shameful girl as a daughter. From this day 
forth Sachiko is no longer a part of the Ogasawara family. She may 
return only to retrieve her belongings and then she will never be 
allowed on the property again.&quot;

He signs off on each point of the contract, as do Suguru and Sei as 
witnesses should this ever come up in court one day. Suguru is sent to 
make a copy of everything, pictures and article included, just in case. 
We talk over the details of how everything will be arranged so that 
Sachiko will get a monthly payment from her father deposited into her 
own bank account for living costs and he will pay the school directly. 
They quickly escort us out of the house but instead of being nasty as 
anticipated I felt a strong hand clamping on my shoulder.

&quot;You&#39;re going to be one hell of a lawyer one day,&quot; her father says.

If I ever get the chance, I think to myself as we walk away.

Back in the car it&#39;s celebration all around. Eriko takes care of calling 
Rei and telling her to pick up Yoshino and go to Shizuma&#39;s. I take care 
of calling Shimako and tell her that we refuse to take no for an answer. 
Her and Noriko are coming as well.

Sei stops by Yumi&#39;s house to pick her up before we head to Shimako&#39;s 
families temple to pick her and Noriko up. Somehow the six of us manage 
to fit, with Noriko happily sitting on Shimako&#39;s lap. Sei rushes to 
Shizuma&#39;s apartment and by the time we get inside everyone is eager to 
know why we&#39;ve suddenly gathered them all together in such a rush.

&quot;Today we celebrate,&quot; Sei speaks up first once everyone is seated and 
looking at the three of us.

&quot;We did that last night,&quot; Rei grumbles as she holds her head.

&quot;It&#39;s not our fault someone has a hangover,&quot; Eriko teases her petite 
soeur. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll fill you two in on the details of that 
later,&quot; Eriko finishes as she notices Shimako&#39;s confused look.

&quot;Be glad you didn&#39;t go,&quot; Yumi whines as she too holds her head.

&quot;Anyways,&quot; I step in and get their attention. &quot;Today is an even more 
special day. Today we celebrate love.&quot; The three of us grin at each 
other as we walk over to Shizuma and Sachiko who are groggily cuddled 
together on the couch. &quot;Today my sister is free to love who she loves, 
and wed who she chooses.&quot;

----

Did my jaw just drop? I think it must have. Did she really pull it off? 
I watch as she stands in front of Sachiko, who&#39;s jaw has also dropped, 
and hands her some papers. After she is done explaining what the three 
of them have just done everyone cheers and Shizuma, estatic as I&#39;ve ever 
seen her, picks Sachiko up and hugs her tightly to her.

&quot;To the freedom of loving who you want,&quot; Yoshino cheers.

The sentiment is shared by Noriko who suddenly kisses Shimako. Shimako&#39;s 
blush covers her entire face once the younger girl pulls away from her.

&quot;Now she shows she&#39;s a real Gigantea!&quot; Sei calls as she musses Noriko&#39;s 
hair. Noriko stands proud at the comment, glad to have Sei finally voice 
her approval.

&quot;There&#39;s more,&quot; Youko says evenly.

We all return our attention to her and she looks somewhat nervous. She 
looks straight at me. Straight in the eyes. My heart suddenly races as I 
wait for what she is about to say.

&quot;Even though it was my job as onee-sama to teach Sachiko everything she 
needed to know I have learned a lot from her lately. And thanks to her, 
if you are still willing Miyuki, I&#39;d like to accompany you to Europe.&quot;

I look at her in shock.

Everyone else looks at me in anticipation.

I remember her note from this morning. The first time she hasn&#39;t run 
from what she feels. The first time she hasn&#39;t turned around and been 
cold to me until she cracked again.

&quot;Don&#39;t you have to go back to school?&quot; I ask as the last bit of logic 
cries out in my brain.

&quot;I&#39;ve bent the will of the mighty Ogasawara Group today. I&#39;m certain I 
can convince someone, somewhere, to give me a decent job with that sort 
of resume.&quot;

Her eyes shine as she stands proud. She takes a few steps to stand in 
front of me and takes my hand in her own. I think I might be in love 
with this woman.

&quot;So long as I get to stay with you when I come back,&quot; I answer finally.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way,&quot; she says before pulling me to her.

&quot;And where will we live?&quot; I ask, sliding my body against hers.

She looks to the left of us at Shizuma and grins. &quot;I think they wouldn&#39;t 
be opposed to the idea of roommates?&quot;

&quot;After what you&#39;ve just done for us you can have anything you want,&quot; 
Shizuma says happily.

&quot;Then I think you know your answer,&quot; I say finally.

Her fierce kiss nearly brought me to my knees.

&quot;So where are we going to celebrate?&quot; Sachiko asks.

&quot;Amusement park!&quot; Yumi calls out, obviously forgetting her headache.

&quot;Oh God no,&quot; Rei cries.

Youko and I both laugh but we don&#39;t care. Our fingers lace together as 
she pulls me down onto the couch against her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for lying to 
myself this whole time, but I know better now,&quot; she whispers to me.

I&#39;m tired of words.

I kiss her again, forgetting the other girls around us.

&quot;Um, can we eat?&quot; Shimako asks quietly. &quot;Someone interrupted our meal 
this morning.&quot; She looks at Sei who laughs.

&quot;Sure you&#39;re ready for this family?&quot; Youko asks as we move to all pile 
back into the vehicles for lunch.

&quot;I&#39;ve never wanted anything more.&quot;</pre>
