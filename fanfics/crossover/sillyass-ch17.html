<h1>Silly Assed Utena X-Over Fic (part 17 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/sillyass-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>        Washu laughed maniacally, &quot;Throw the lever!&quot;

        &quot;Are you sure about this?&quot; Mackie asked nervously.

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Washu declared, &quot;I am the greatest scientific genius in 
the universe!&quot;

        &quot;Brace yourselves,&quot; Belldandy warned the others.

        Urd, Mara, Sailor Mercury, Rei Ayanami, Sailor Pluto, and all 
the other members of their improvised research committee all ducked 
under various pieces of furniture. Naga and Lina were too busy 
boinking over in the corner to notice, but with all of Naga&#39;s extra 
padding around the chest area they&#39;d probably both be all right.

        &quot;Throwing lever,&quot; Mackie pulled the switch, there was a loud 
click, then nothing.

        After a long moment of silence Sailor Mercury stuck her head 
out cautiously to ask, &quot;Did nothing happen?&quot;

        Washu looked up at the device thoughtfully, &quot;I thought my 
calculations were correct.&quot;

        &quot;Could we have missed a decimal point?&quot; Yume frowned.

        A very odd look appeared on Sailor Pluto&#39;s face, and she 
tilted her head to the side as if listening to something only she 
could hear. &quot;Oh, dear,&quot; she murmured softly.

        Sailor Mercury activated her visor, scanning about her until 
her face went oddly pale. &quot;Could someone take a look outside, please?&quot; 
she asked weakly.

        Rei Ayanami pushed open the window and gazed down at the 
campus below. &quot;It looks like there are multiple versions of everyone 
down there,&quot; she reported coolly.

        &quot;WASHU!&quot; everyone yelled together.

        &quot;Lets get to work,&quot; Washu sighed to Yume as they began to go 
over the device.

        Sitting in the student council chambers Arisugawa Juri raised 
her eyebrow as several versions of herself lounged all around the 
room, looking at each other. &quot;Do any of us know what&#39;s going on?&quot; she 
finally had to ask.

        &quot;No idea,&quot; the Juri dressed in the stylish black flight suit 
spoke up, &quot;I just hope I can get back to my Gundam soon.&quot;

        &quot;Gundam,&quot; the original Juri echoed weakly.

        &quot;I pilot the Wing Zero in Releena&#39;s service,&quot; Juri agreed, 
&quot;and I have pledged to protect her with my very life.&quot;

        &quot;I just hope I can get back before Touga does anything too 
rash,&quot; a third Juri offered, &quot;he lets his emotions override his reason 
sometimes.&quot;

        &quot;The play is only a few days away,&quot; Juri mused, oddly dressed 
just like Ryouko, &quot;and I will not disappoint my Utena-sama by not 
performing my role.&quot;

        &quot;My Utena?&quot; Juri smirked softly, &quot;congratulations.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; the space pirate garbed Juri smiled.

        &quot;None of this matters,&quot; another Juri scowled, &quot;it&#39;s soon time 
for my duel with Utena-kun, and I will prove to the school she is no 
prince!&quot; Softly, under her breath she added, &quot;For Shiori&#39;s sake, I 
have sworn to do so.&quot;

        &quot;Ookaay,&quot; Juri backed away from her overly intense 
counterpart.

        Outside a whip cracked loudly, and a wide-eyed Utena slowly 
backed away from the black leather clad vision standing before her.

        &quot;Bow down and lick my boots!&quot; Dominatrix Anthy commanded.

        There was a disturbance in the crowd, followed by a chorus of 
soft female sighs. Another Utena appeared, not dressed in the boy&#39;s 
school uniform but in a suit, nearly radiating a magnetic charm. &quot;I&#39;m 
sure that isn&#39;t necessary,&quot; Mega-playboy Utena smiled at her 
charmingly, &quot;isn&#39;t there something more.. entertaining we could do?&quot;

        The dominatrix smiled slightly, running the handle of her whip 
along the charming Utena&#39;s jaw. &quot;Indeed,&quot; Anthy purred dangerously, 
and the two retreated to the dorm together.

        &quot;Thank the kami,&quot; Utena sighed in relief.

        &quot;Utena-sama!&quot; several sweet sounding feminine voices cried as 
a small army of Wakaba&#39;s glomped every Utena in sight, sending some 
crashing to the ground and others staggering in circles.

        Back in the central lab Washu cried out again, &quot;Throw the 
lever!&quot;

        &quot;But why do I have to throw the lever?&quot; Nene asked 
plaintively, &quot;I hate being at ground zero when one of her devices goes 
off!&quot;

        &quot;Because it&#39;s your turn,&quot; the others shouted from their places 
of safety.

        &quot;Pulling lever!&quot; Nene squeaked out fearfully.

        There was another loud click.

        After a few moments of relative silence Rei Ayanami got up and 
walked over to the window. &quot;The doubles are gone,&quot; she reported, &quot;but 
nothing else has changed.&quot;

        &quot;Back to the drawing board,&quot; Washu sighed.

Appearing this Episode: Utena, Anthy, Wakaba, and Juri from 
Revolutionary Girl Utena. Washu, Yume and Ryouko are from Tenchi Muyo. 
Belldandy, Urd and Mara are from Oh My Goddess. Nene and Mackie are 
from Bubblegum Crisis. Lina and Naga are from Slayers. Rei Ayanami is

Authors Note: Gundam Wing Juri is from an incomplete Gundam W/Utena 
fusion I&#39;ve been fiddling with, Movie and Manga versions of Juri 
appear, and one Juri is from my fic, &quot;Utena Muyo! or No Need for 
Utena!&quot; Both Dominatrix Anthy and Mega-Playboy Utena are from the 
Blood Soaked and Honor Bound mailing list, of which I&#39;m a member. ^_^
