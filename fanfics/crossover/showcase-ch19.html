<a href="../crossover/showcase-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>Suicide Squad

Bette Sans Souci Adam, also known as the former
criminal Plastique, strode down the hallway in her
business suit, her orange-red hair flowing around her
shoulders. &quot;Are they ready?&quot; she asked the guard
calmly.

&quot;All set,&quot; the blonde haired boy nodded.

The dusky skinned man at Bette&#39;s side frowned at him.
&quot;Don&#39;t get cocky,&quot; Ben Turner cautioned him, the
former martial artist called Bronze Tiger.

&quot;Sir,&quot; the boy stiffened nervously.

&quot;Let&#39;s go in,&quot; Bette hid a smile.

The men and women gathered there were a garish lot,
picked from prisons from across the country. They were
second or third stringers, b-list baddies who were
more known for hitting banks than fighting noble
battles with superhumans.

&quot;Attention!&quot; Ben barked, bringing conversation to a
halt.

&#39;He hung around Colonel Flag too long,&#39; Bette thought
with a sigh. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; she addressed the
group, &quot;welcome to the Suicide squad.&quot;

&quot;Just my thing,&quot; Disaster muttered, the brown haired
young man lounging in a chair. Having acquired and
enhanced the gear of the villain Major Disaster he
tried using his powers for extortion, only to run into
members of the JSA.

Kasumi the assassin was silent as usual, the black
clad killer leaning against the far wall. Nearby the
Ragged Man played with the living cloth of his
uniform, snapping pieces of wood with an eerie sort
ease. Breach, the alien superwarrior, looked on coldly
from his icy white skin, while nearby Mayflower drank
from a bottle of water.

&quot;What&#39;s the mission?&quot; Breach asked coldly, the red
paint on his face giving him a odd, almost angular
look.

&quot;It&#39;s going to be interesting,&quot; Bette smiled slightly
as she moved to the front of the room and activated a
digital projector. A battered image of a space craft
appeared, &quot;This is a Khund scout craft, one we believe
sent from Warworld.&quot;

&quot;We take it out?&quot; Ragged Man mumbled, the flowing
cloth of his body muffling his words a bit.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ben nodded, &quot;but we want any survivors
captured, not killed. They may have valuable
information on the invasion.&quot;

&quot;So when do we go?&quot; Mayflower asked.

&quot;Once your minder arrives,&quot; Bette said as a door slid
open and a figure in green and black strode in.

&quot;All right people,&quot; Alexis Armstrong, the third Spy
Smasher said, &quot;let&#39;s move out.&quot;

&quot;Remember,&quot; Ben added as the group followed Spy
Smasher out, &quot;you&#39;ve all been fitted with
micro-explosives. If needed, we can blow your heads
off.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Mayflower agreed, the red head dressed
entirely in her mentally controlled plant vines.

The mini-jet launched on autopilot as Bette and Ben
headed into their command center. &quot;Do you think this
is going to work out?&quot; Bette asked.

Ben sighed as he took a seat, &quot;I&#39;ve got a bad
feeling.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Bette agreed. &quot;Max, status?&quot; she asked.

Max Faraday sat in front of the main command console,
monitoring the mission. &quot;They&#39;re reaching peak flight
path,&quot; he confirmed calmly, &quot;they&#39;ll be at the ship in
minutes.&quot;

&quot;Keep a close eye on them,&quot; Ben ordered.

0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Alexis Armstrong braced herself as the jet descended,
the kevlar and armor clothes she wore shielding her a
bit as they splashed down into the sand, skidding to a
stop. &quot;All right,&quot; she said as she swiftly unstrapped
herself from her seat, &quot;let&#39;s move, people.&quot;

Kasumi flowed like a shadow out of her chair, the
others somewhat less gracefully following her out into
the sunny Nevada plain. Breach&#39;s eyes glowed for a
moment, &quot;No sign of movement within the ship.&quot;

&quot;You sure?&quot; Disaster asked dryly.

Breach gave him a cold look, &quot;My flash vision does not
lie.&quot;

&quot;Move forward slowly,&quot; Alexis ordered as they walked
to the ship, &quot;there&#39;s no way to know if there are any
traps.&quot; Silently she mused, &#39;Supposedly these crooks
are in the Squad for the chance to reform, but how can
we be sure?&#39;

Mayflower waved Breach forward as her lip curled in
disgust, &quot;You first, big guy.&quot;

The hull of the ship had ruptured on impact, creating
a hole large enough for them to enter the vessel. The
air within had a bitter tang but other than that
seemed breathable, the lights in the halls flickering
dimly.

Kasumi slinked forward dangerously, then stopped cold.
The sword on her shoulder was drawn, then oddly she
shifted, driving the blade right into a wall nearby.

&quot;What in...&quot; Disaster started.

&quot;Yeargh...!&quot; the section of the hall rippled, then
changed as a green skinned alien struggled on the end
of Kasumi&#39;s blade.

&quot;Durlan,&quot; Breach said coldly as he hurried forward to
pull the writhing alien from the end of Kasumi&#39;s
blade.

Alexis scowled as she swept their surroundings with
her eyes, &quot;Damn shape changers. Everyone, be on your
guard.&quot;

&quot;$#&amp;&quot; the alien gibbered.

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Mayflower muttered, &quot;anyone speak that?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a form of interlac,&quot; Breach informed them, &quot;the
Durlan claims to be the only member of it&#39;s kind on
the ship.&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s what I&#39;d say too,&quot; the Ragged Man noted
dryly.

Disaster scowled, &quot;Why don&#39;t I just bury this whole
ship and be done with it?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Alexis gave him a look, &quot;we&#39;re going to search
this ship, damn it.&quot; She pulled a pistol from hip
holsters as she said, &quot;Let&#39;s go. Breach, keep a grip
on the Durlan.&quot;

&quot;Understood.&quot;

Moving deeper into the ship Mayflower sent plant
tendrils ahead of them to scout, leaving the slim girl
mostly nude. &quot;I think we&#39;re coming up to the control
room,&quot; she reported as a tendril of plant crawled up
her thigh.

&#39;Eww,&#39; Alexis thought, fighting down a shudder. She
checked the safety on her pistol, &quot;Breach takes point,
with Ragged Man and Kasumi after him, then the rest of
us. Remember, no killing unless absolutely needed.&quot;

&quot;Do our best,&quot; Disaster said dryly.

The hatch in front of them was partially open, enough
to see a figure slumped over the main controls. With a
incredible show of strength Breach ripped the door
open, then the team hurried inside as they looked
around wildly.

&quot;Where...?&quot; Ragged Man hissed.

Suddenly, a energy bolt sliced down from above,
cutting the Ragged Man in two, his supernatural cloth
no protection from a laser. With a howl the squat but
muscular Khund soldiers dropped from the ceiling,
firing wildly.

&quot;Shit,&quot; Alexis cursed as she fired even as Kasumi
leapt and dodged, soon soaking her sword in Khund
blood.

Breach stood calmly firing energy bolts from his
hands, burning Khund soldiers with brutal efficiency.
&quot;If you want to live,&quot; he warned Mayflower and
Disaster, &quot;get behind me.&quot;

Mayflower scampered across the floor, &quot;Don&#39;t have to
tell me twice.&quot;

&quot;Die,&quot; Disaster blew up a control panel, killing a
Khund and starting a fire.

&quot;You idiot,&quot; Alexis cursed as toxic smoke began to
fill the room, &quot;we&#39;ve got to take the fight outside,
now!&quot;

&quot;Die, Earther,&quot; a Khund growled as he fired, the blast
nearly taking Alexis&#39; head off.

&quot;Follow me,&quot; Breach gestured and the wall blew
outward, the smoke spreading out a bit as sunlight
shone in.

Kasumi cut one alien down as Mayflower tangled a Khund
in vines then they ran outside, the sunlight feeding
her plant based powers. &quot;Disaster,&quot; she yelled, &quot;hit
&#39;em!&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Disaster gestured, the earth itself buckling
and moving as the ground under the ship split. Before
the alien ship could fall too deep into the hole he
brought his hands together, crushing the Khund between
stone slabs.

BOOOM!

&quot;You idiots,&quot; Alexis glared at the Squad, &quot;you killed
them all. We needed captives to interrogate, damn it.&quot;

&quot;They killed Ragged Man,&quot; Breach calmly noted, &quot;they
had to pay.&quot; He held up the now limp Durlan captive,
&quot;Besides, we still have someone left to question.&quot;

Kasumi slid her sword away with a soft hiss and said
the first words they&#39;d heard from her that mission,
&quot;Where&#39;s the ship?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Mayflower looked around.

&quot;Uhm,&quot; Disaster looked sheepish, &quot;my powers kind of
have a ripple effect. I think our ship got sucked
under by a sink hole I accidently made.&quot;

Alexis whimpered softly. &quot;The radios better still
work,&quot; she growled, &quot;or we&#39;re walking back to
civilization.&quot;

To be continued...

Notes: All these are revised versions of DC second
stringers, more or less. Alexis is the daughter of the
new Spy Smasher introduced in Birds of Prey
recently...</pre>
