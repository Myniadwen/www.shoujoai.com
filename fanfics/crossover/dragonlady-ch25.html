<a href="../crossover/dragonlady-ch24.html">Back to Part 24</a><pre>(A/N: I know I pretty much ignored the three Zentradi spies&#39; experiences 
with Mistress Bertha. I thought it would make a good side-story, but one 
I am not knowledgeable enough in the BDSM community to write. I would 
like to open the floor for somebody else to write it that is either into 
the BDSM scene of at least can bluff it better than I can. If you&#39;re 
interested, contact me.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

March 2011...

&quot;How is he?&quot; Ranma asked as she looked into the room where the Zentradi 
she captured was strapped down.

&quot;He has a broken nose, a concussion, and his knee is destroyed,&quot; Lang 
said. &quot;I really don&#39;t know what we&#39;re going to do with him.&quot;

&quot;Neither do I,&quot; Ranma shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s not like we really need to 
interrogate him with all the ones that defected. I couldn&#39;t just kill 
him though. Not in cold blood like that.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Lang said. &quot;The others did say that he is one of their 
higher ups. They called him Kyron the Backstabber because he will kill 
his own troops just to get at the enemy.&quot;

&quot;Real stand up guy, huh?&quot; Ranma remarked. &quot;He doesn&#39;t seem to take 
defeat especially well either.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I heard that,&quot; Lang chuckled. &quot;Capturing him will be a good thing 
from what we&#39;ve been lead to believe though. It seems he is something of 
a loose cannon and is responsible for most of the attacks on the SDF-1. 
Most of the time he was operating against orders.&quot;

&quot;Look, he&#39;s awake,&quot; Ranma commented. &quot;I think I&#39;ll go in and talk to 
him.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure you want to do that?&quot; Lang asked.

&quot;Sure, it&#39;ll be fun,&quot; Ranma grinned. &quot;The guy has a seriously inflated 
ego. I just have this irresistible urge to deflate it a bit.&quot;

Ranma entered the room and walked up to the prone, forty-foot egomaniac.

&quot;So, Blue Boy, how&#39;s the knee?&quot; Ranma smirked.

&quot;You!&quot; Kyron snarled. &quot;Release me at once, you little Micronian bitch!&quot;

&quot;Not happenin&#39;, Blue Boy,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I have to ask; how&#39;s it feel to 
get your giant, forty-foot ass kicked by a tiny Micronian girl?&quot;

Kyron began to sputter incoherently.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ranma agreed, &quot;if I was you, I&#39;d be feeling pretty humiliated 
right now. Ah, well. I was getting kinda bored kicking your ass all the 
time. Just think, now I won&#39;t have to.&quot;

By now, Kyron was so furious, he was frothing at the mouth. He thrashed 
against his bounds, but that didn&#39;t last very long as the pain from his 
wounds quickly made itself known.

&quot;Well, I just wanted to come in and meet the great Kyron face to face,&quot; 
Ranma said. &quot;I gotta tell you, Blue Boy, I&#39;m not impressed at all. 
You&#39;re just an egocentric weakling that likes to kill his own troops. 
Heh, loser.&quot;

Kyron snarled in frustrated rage as Ranma walked out.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Lang commented, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen anyone turn quite 
that shade of puce before.&quot;

&quot;Not pretty, is it?&quot; Ranma grinned.

&quot;Not at all,&quot; Lang chuckled. &quot;By the way, Commander, we&#39;ve developed a 
new weapons system. It&#39;s a new armored Veritech package. Basically, it&#39;s 
made up of add-on pods that give a Veritech 10 times the firepower of a 
standard Veritech. It mounts two heavy beam cannon based on the Zentradi 
weapons and an auxiliary reflex power source to power them. There&#39;s also 
a sensor upgrade that allows you to target lock more enemies at once and 
a greatly increased missile payload.&quot;

&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Have it installed and I&#39;ll evaluate it.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

April 2011...

&quot;Yo, Stick!&quot; Marissa called as she walked up with Erin and Vicki.

Max looked up from his lunch and waved.

&quot;Hey, Marissa,&quot; Max greeted. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;

&quot;Hey, Vicki, Erin, and I were going down to the arcade for some R&amp;R,&quot; 
Marissa explained. &quot;You wanna come along?&quot;

&quot;Sure, I&#39;m always up for a good game,&quot; Max agreed.

The four of them trooped down to the arcade. Once there, they began to 
play the various games offered. Max proved to be some sort of video game 
genius as he won almost every game he played.

&quot;Damn, Stick,&quot; Marissa grinned as she watched him. &quot;You&#39;re gonna break 
the bank there if you keep it up.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I always win more money than I can carry away,&quot; Max said 
casually. Marissa laughed as more tokens were dispensed from the game 
Max had just won. &quot;I guess you&#39;re right though. I better cash in before 
they don&#39;t allow me to play anymore.&quot;

Max picked up his tray and stacked his newly won credits on it. They 
headed down from the mezzanine level toward the checkout, but Max 
suddenly stopped on the stairs.

&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; Marissa asked, having almost run into him.

&quot;Look at that girl down there,&quot; Max said in awe. &quot;I&#39;ve been seeing her 
everywhere. She&#39;s totally hot.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Marissa grinned. &quot;Got a thing for her, huh? Why don&#39;t you go ask 
her out?&quot;

&quot;Oh, no I couldn&#39;t do that,&quot; Max said shyly. &quot;I mean look at her. She&#39;s 
so exquisite. What would she want with a guy like me?&quot;

&quot;You might be surprised, Stick,&quot; Marissa laughed. &quot;I mean you&#39;re not 
hard on the eyes and you&#39;re a damn good pilot. Hey, look at that pile of 
tokens she&#39;s won. She looks like she&#39;s pretty good at the games. Maybe 
you could challenge her. That way you could put yourself on the scope 
and she&#39;d notice you.&quot;

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s not a bad idea!&quot; Max said excitedly. &quot;I&#39;ll do it! Thanks, 
Marissa.&quot;

&quot;Sure, Stick. Glad I could...help...&quot; Marissa blinked at the empty air 
she was talking to. &quot;Geez, he must really have it bad for her.&quot;

&quot;Hi there,&quot; Max said as he made his way through the crowd of people 
watching the girl play. &quot;I couldn&#39;t help but notice, you&#39;re pretty good. 
I&#39;m pretty good too, would you like to play against me?&quot;

The green-haired beauty looked up from her game at the tray of tokens in 
Max&#39;s hands.

&quot;Are you going to bet all that?&quot; the woman asked with a slight smile, 
obviously thinking this would be easy pickings.

&quot;Well, sure. Why not,&quot; Max grinned, sliding into the seat on the 
opposite side of the game. &quot;Why don&#39;t we start on level B?&quot;

&quot;Of course, if you like,&quot; the woman agreed.

Over the next half-hour the two battled it out. The game was a Veritech 
simulator game and Max had started them on the second hardest difficulty 
level. Eventually, Max managed to come out one top. He completely missed 
the woman&#39;s look of anger at the defeat.

The woman, none other than Miriya Parino, Maltradi division 
spy/assassin, seethed at her defeat by yet another Micronian. That is 
until she caught sight of his unit patch. It was a black oval with a 
dark pink rose in it. Around the edge it read in silver script &#39;Wild 
Rose Veritech Fighter Squadron&#39;.

&quot;You fly with Wild Rose?&quot; she asked casually.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Max replied. &quot;We&#39;re the best.&quot;

&quot;What number are you?&quot; Miriya inquired conversationally.

&quot;Right now, I fly Wild Rose 3, but I used to be 4,&quot; Max replied. &quot;Would 
you like to play again on the highest level?&quot;

&quot;Yes, let&#39;s do that,&quot; Miriya said, feeling strange inside as she looked 
up at the man she now knew as her prey. She felt...excited. &#39;Soon,&#39; she 
thought, &#39;soon I will have my revenge.&#39;

They played against each other for another hour. The battle was drawing 
quite a crowd and the staff had put it up on the big monitor so everyone 
could watch. Finally, Max managed to score a crippling hit and Miriya&#39;s 
battloid soon disintegrated.

She was furious at having been dealt yet another humiliating defeat. It 
was intolerable. She had to get away before she...well, she didn&#39;t know 
what she would do, but her eyes seemed to burn and she felt 
so...frustrated. She rose and turned to leave but a hand caught hers.

&quot;Please, I don&#39;t even know your name,&quot; Max said. &quot;Mine&#39;s Max, Max 
Sterling.&quot;

&quot;My name is Miriya, now may I please go?&quot; Miriya replied, barely keeping 
her intense feelings in check.

&quot;Can I see you again? How about meeting me in the park at 9pm tonight?&quot; 
Max said, unable to believe he actually asked this vision of loveliness 
out.

&quot;Yes, yes, of course,&quot; Miriya said, ready to agree to anything just to 
escape this situation before she further humiliated herself. &quot;I must 
go.&quot;

&quot;Sure, it was nice to meet you,&quot; Max said as the woman practically fled 
the arcade.

&quot;Way to go, Stick!&quot; Marissa cheered. &quot;I knew you had it in you. I hope 
she shows though. She didn&#39;t seem too happy about you winning.&quot;

&quot;You think?&quot; Max asked, surprised that someone would take a game so 
seriously.

&quot;Sure seemed that way,&quot; Marissa observed. &quot;I guess you&#39;ll find out if 
she stands you up.&quot;

&quot;Geez, I hope I didn&#39;t offend her,&quot; Max said, distressed. &quot;Maybe I 
should have let her win.&quot;

&quot;Nah, don&#39;t worry about it, Stick,&quot; Marissa reassured him. &quot;If she 
doesn&#39;t show it&#39;s her loss, not yours. Got it?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; Max said, still worried. &quot;Thanks Marissa.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;I guess Marissa must have been right,&quot; Max said to himself morosely. &quot;I 
guess I did offend her. I hope nothing happened to her though.&quot; He 
looked at his watch. It was ten minutes after nine. &quot;I&#39;ll give her a few 
more minutes.&quot;

&quot;MAX STERLING OF THE WILD ROSE SQUADRON!&quot; Max whirled at the angry 
sounding shout. &quot;PREPARE TO DIE!&quot;

Max had to use all his training with Ranma to dodge out of the path of a 
dagger that flew at him. He was shocked to recognize his attacker as the 
girl, Miriya, her face twisted with hatred and rage.

&quot;Miriya! What are you doing? Are you crazy?&quot; Max yelled.

&quot;I am Miriya Parino, Captain of the Quadrano elite squadron of the 
Meltradi division of the Zentradi,&quot; she announced proudly, pulling a 
tanto. &quot;Now I will have my revenge on you!&quot;

She slashed at him, but Max evaded easily thanks to Ranma&#39;s training.

&quot;I...I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Max asked, evading another slash. &quot;I know you 
said you&#39;re of the Zentradi, but what revenge?&quot; Max was proving to be a 
frustratingly illusive target.

&quot;I will have my revenge for the humiliation you&#39;ve caused me!&quot; Miriya 
shrieked and slashed again, fruitlessly.

&quot;How did I humiliate you? It was just a game,&quot; Max said, not 
understanding the evident hatred and rage she held for him.

&quot;I am the greatest of the Zentradi pilots,&quot; Miriya screamed. &quot;I cannot 
accept defeat at the hands of a mere Micronian. I was undefeated until I 
met you in the battle inside this city! Now stand still and die!&quot;

&quot;Sorry, that&#39;d be bad for my health,&quot; Max smirked as he dodged another 
slash.

He realized he would have to do more than dodge, so he steeled himself 
of combat. Dodging a few more slashes, he saw his opportunity. She 
thrust the tanto at him and he used one of the disarming moves Ranma had 
showed him. He chopped the nerve cluster located in the inside of her 
wrist while slapping the back of her hand with his other hand. The tanto 
went flying out of reach.

Stunned at his speed, Miriya knew she couldn&#39;t defeat him unarmed. He 
was clearly better than her at unarmed combat. She sank to her knees in 
defeat. Tears of humiliation began to run down her cheeks.

&quot;Please,&quot; Miriya said. &quot;Please just end my life. I can&#39;t live with this 
defeat.&quot;

Max saw the tears and felt his heart twist in his chest. He reached down 
and gently tilted her head up until he met her beautiful grey-green 
eyes.

&quot;But you haven&#39;t been defeated,&quot; Max said softly. He tenderly wiped her 
tears away as she looked at him in confusion.

&quot;W..what do you mean?&quot; she asked.

&quot;You&#39;ve conquered my heart,&quot; Max said with a gentle smile. &quot;I could 
never hurt you, because I&#39;ve fallen in love with you.&quot;

&quot;What is &#39;love&#39;?&quot; she asked, still confused.

&quot;I once heard my commanding officer say that you know you&#39;re in love 
when there is a person you are attracted to and suddenly you find that 
their happiness and wellbeing mean more to you than your own,&quot; Max 
explained. &quot;She told me that when you&#39;re in love, you will do anything 
to make the person you love deliriously happy, even if it hurts you. I 
love you, Miriya. I want to marry you.&quot;

&quot;Marry? What does that mean?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Well, when two people are attracted to each other and they fall in 
love, they get married,&quot; Max explained. &quot;Marriage is a ceremony where 
two people pledge themselves to one another, to always be together and 
to have a family.&quot;

&quot;I...I think...&quot; Miriya searched herself. Looking at Max made her feel 
warm all over. She still felt the same sense of excitement that she felt 
before and had mistaken for the anticipation of battle. Suddenly, it all 
snapped into place for her and her basic human instinct rushed to the 
fore and she understood what love was. &quot;I think I love you too, Max. I 
want to marry you too. I am attracted to you. You are a fine warrior and 
I&#39;ve never seen better.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re about to,&quot; Max said with a happy smile.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Miriya asked.

&quot;Well, we need to go talk to my CO, the Dragon Lady,&quot; Max said. &quot;If we 
want to marry, we will need her help.&quot;

&quot;Is she really better than you?&quot; Miriya asked in wonder.

&quot;Who do you think taught me everything I know?&quot; Max said. &quot;She has more 
raw talent than anyone on this ship, both in the cockpit and in unarmed 
combat. She&#39;s a high-level martial artist and you wouldn&#39;t believe how 
powerful she is. But don&#39;t get any ideas, she&#39;s already married.&quot; Max 
chuckled at his own joke.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Max,&quot; Miriya said. &quot;I&#39;ve fallen in love with you. I would 
like to meet this Dragon Lady though. To be in the presence of one so 
powerful would be an honor.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Max knocked on the door to Ranma&#39;s quarters. After a short wait, the 
door opened to reveal Ranma holding her baby on her chest.

&quot;Hey Mom. Hey, Yoshima, how ya doin&#39; lil&#39; guy?&quot; Max greeted, his voice 
taking on a gentle tone and a warm smile. Yoshima cooed at him, 
producing a bright smile that only babies are capable of.

&quot;Hey, Stick. What&#39;s up?&quot; Ranma greeted with her own smile.

&quot;Well, I kinda needed to talk to you about something,&quot; Max said, a 
little nervously. &quot;I can come back if now&#39;s not a good time.&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s okay,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I just finished feeding Yoshima. Lisa&#39;s on 
duty and Mom stepped out for a bit to do some shopping. Come on in.&quot;

&quot;Oh, okay, um...Mom, I&#39;d like you to meet Miriya Parino,&quot; Max said as he 
pulled an absolutely gorgeous woman into view at his side. She was tall, 
with deep green hair, and had on a lovely sundress. &quot;Miriya, this is my 
commanding officer, Ranma Saotome-Hayes, otherwise known as the Dragon 
Lady or DL for short. The members of Wild Rose Squadron call her &#39;Mom&#39;. 
The little guy in her arms is her son, Yoshima, who will also call her 
&#39;Mom&#39; when he learns to speak.&quot;

Miriya was utterly captivated by the mother and child...on several 
levels. On the one hand, she was surprised to find that this petite 
redhead was the Micronian&#39;s greatest warrior. She seemed almost frail 
and couldn&#39;t possibly be as powerful as everyone seemed to think. But 
she was unwilling to doubt her new love. She had also seen this woman 
fight Kyron and knew she was as good in the cockpit as had been said.

Yoshima, however, was something else entirely. This small Micronian 
seemed so tiny and fragile, but somehow the baby fascinated Miriya. 
Something inside her called out for...something...one of her own? 
Clearly there was a link between the mother and the child. A glow of 
fulfillment, of pure and total love and trust that was shared between 
the two. Yoshima looked at Miriya with bright cerulean eyes and cooed 
happily at her. Miriya felt her insides turn to goo. She had seen the 
small Micronians during her search for Max, but this was the first time 
she had been this close to one.

&quot;Hi, Miriya,&quot; Ranma said cheerfully, shaking Miriya out of her thoughts. 
&quot;Nice to meet you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s an honor to meet you, Commander,&quot; Miriya said.

&quot;Please, just call me Ranma,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Come in both of you and have 
a seat. Can I get you a soda or something?&quot;

&quot;Sure, that&#39;d be great,&quot; Max said.

&quot;Yes, please,&quot; Miriya said politely.

Ranma went to the kitchen and soon returned to the main room with two 
sodas. She passed them out and sat in the chair next to the couch.

&quot;Would you like to hold him?&quot; Ranma asked with a warm smile, noticing 
Miriya&#39;s continued fascination with Yoshima.

&quot;Oh, may I?&quot; Miriya asked with unaccustomed eagerness.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Ranma said cheerfully, standing and coming over to Miriya.

She took the towel off her shoulder and instructed Miriya to lay in on 
hers, explaining that Yoshima just ate and Ranma didn&#39;t want him to spit 
up on Miriya&#39;s pretty dress. Clearly Miriya wasn&#39;t experienced with 
babies so Ranma showed her how to hold him correctly and soon Miriya was 
off in her own little world, gazing in rapt awe at the little one she 
now held. Ranma grinned and returned to her chair.

&quot;Now what did you want to talk about?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Well,&quot; Max said nervously. &quot;I&#39;ve asked Miriya to marry me.&quot;

&quot;Wow, congratulations,&quot; Ranma said, happily. &quot;I didn&#39;t even know you 
were seeing anyone.&quot; Max chuckled nervously.

&quot;Ah, yeah, well, I just met her this afternoon,&quot; Max grinned. Ranma 
blinked once, then twice at him.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, what?&quot; Ranma asked, not sure she believed what she just 
heard.

&quot;I just met her this afternoon,&quot; Max repeated. &quot;I asked her to marry me 
and she said yes.&quot;

&quot;Um...okay, that&#39;s a little fast, but it&#39;s your life,&quot; Ranma said 
cautiously.

&quot;There&#39;s a small problem though,&quot; Max admitted.

&quot;And that would be?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Miriya is a Zentradi,&quot; Max confessed.

Ranma&#39;s eyes snapped to the green-haired woman holding her son, her 
whole body singing with tension. Her blue-grey eyes met the other 
woman&#39;s grey-green ones and promised vast amounts of pain if any harm 
came to her baby. Miriya clearly understood the message behind the 
intense gaze.

&quot;Would you like him back?&quot; Miriya offered somewhat sadly. Ranma looked 
deeply into her eyes for a few more moments. Miriya got the impression 
the smaller woman was looking right into her soul.

&quot;Only if you&#39;re tired of holding him,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;There&#39;s no hostile 
intent in you aura. Just be very clear that if you harm him your death 
with be long and painful.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Miriya said, truly she did. Long unused maternal 
instincts told her the same thing. These little ones were to be 
protected. Ranma smiled warmly at her.

&quot;He&#39;s the most important thing in the world to me,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I 
didn&#39;t mean to sound rude, but I needed to be clear.&quot;

&quot;Perfectly understandable,&quot; Miriya said. &quot;I mean him or you no harm.&quot; 
Ranma nodded.

&quot;Geez, Max, a small problem?&quot; Ranma grinned at him. &quot;I&#39;d hate to see 
your idea of a big problem.&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s why I&#39;d like your help,&quot; Max admitted.

&quot;You know this is going to be a political circus, don&#39;t you?&quot; Ranma 
asked. &quot;I actually rather like the idea. We already know that Zentradi 
DNA and Human DNA are identical, which is lucky for you, since it looks 
like Miriya wants one of her own.&quot; Ranma giggled and gestured to Miriya 
who was once again absorbed gazing adoringly at little Yoshima. &quot;The 
thing is, the brass are going to want to use your marriage as a tool to 
show that Humans and Zentradi can live in peace. Are you ready to deal 
with that kind of pressure?&quot;

&quot;I love her,&quot; Max said simply.

&quot;I will stand beside Max no matter what,&quot; Miriya vowed.

&quot;Alright,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I&#39;ll talk to the captain. And you certainly have 
my blessing. Not that you need it, but you have it anyway.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t tell you how much that means to me, Mom,&quot; Max said with a 
brilliant smile.

&quot;I too am honored by your approval,&quot; Miriya stated. She indicated the 
baby in her arms. &quot;I am also honored by your trust in me.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not such a big thing,&quot; Ranma gave her a warm smile. &quot;I can see 
the maternal protectiveness in your aura. I saw you couldn&#39;t hurt him 
intentionally.&quot;

&quot;In my aura?&quot; Miriya asked.

&quot;Yes, everyone has an aura,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;A person&#39;s aura will 
change with their different emotions or intents. With enough training in 
the art, one can begin to read these emotions and intents. It makes 
reacting to attacks much faster and after a certain level, one becomes 
consciously aware of what another person&#39;s aura is telling them.&quot;

&quot;Is that why you&#39;re so good?&quot; Miriya asked. &quot;I saw you take down Kyron 
in the city. I was very much impressed. Especially the way you caught 
the missile out of the air and threw it back at him.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s part of it,&quot; Ranma admitted. &quot;With the martial arts training 
I&#39;ve had and the level of bodily control I have attained, I can, for all 
intents and purposes, fully link with me Veritech. That means I can use 
it very much like an extension of my own body.&quot;

&quot;I too have a similar level of link with my mecha,&quot; Miriya said. &quot;It&#39;s 
the reason I am the best of all Zentradi pilots, although I do not think 
I could manage to catch a missile in flight and throw it back at the one 
who launched it.&quot;

&quot;That has to do with my unarmed training more than my piloting ability,&quot; 
Ranma smiled. &quot;I&#39;m the best hand to hand fighter on this ship. Probably 
one of the best of my people, but I do know there are several people on 
Earth that make me look like a rank amateur. They&#39;re usually very old 
and very experienced.&quot;

The three chatted for about another hour before Nodoka arrived. Miriya 
reluctantly surrendered the baby to his doting grandmother and the 
couple made their goodbyes. Ranma told Max that she would go speak with 
the captain as soon as she put her uniform on and would contact him 
later. She told him to be ready because Gloval was probably going to 
want to meet with them.

&quot;So what did you think of her?&quot; Max asked after they had left.

&quot;She&#39;s a very pleasant person,&quot; Miriya said. &quot;It must be wonderful to 
serve under such a commander.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Max agreed. &quot;The whole ship loves her. She&#39;s actually the 
commander of the whole Veritech group aboard the SDF-1. She and her wife 
are reputed to run the whole ship between them.&quot;

&quot;Her wife?&quot; Miriya asked curiously.

&quot;She&#39;s actually married to another woman,&quot; Max explained. &quot;Her wife is 
the First Officer of the ship, Commander Lisa Saotome-Hayes.&quot;

&quot;But I thought marriage was supposed to be between a man and a woman,&quot; 
Miriya remarked, confused.

&quot;Normally it is,&quot; Max said. &quot;There are certain groups of our people that 
look down on same-sex unions, but they aren&#39;t that uncommon. On the 
other hand, things are...complicated for Mom and her wife. I can&#39;t 
explain it right now, but things are not quite what they seem.&quot;

Miriya looked at him strangely, but let it go.

(oO\O/Oo)

After Ranma discussed the matter with Gloval, they met with Max and 
Miriya. The captain was very impressed with the young couple and soon 
gave his full approval to them. A date was set for the ceremony to be 
held in a week. Due to the lack of available friends, Ranma found 
herself drafted into being the Maid of Honor accompanied by Lisa and 
Minmei as bridesmaids. Indeed, if the truth were told, Ranma would 
likely have been Miriya&#39;s choice for Maid of Honor anyway. Miriya seemed 
to respect Ranma greatly and they had quickly become friends.

Between being fitted for her dress, spending time with her family and 
her administrative duties as CAG, Ranma completed the flight trials of 
the new armored Veritech package. She was greatly impressed with the 
speed and firepower increases that it gave. The modular add-ons were 
scheduled for production to be combat tested by Wild Rose and Skull 
flights.

The day finally came for the ceremony and the whole ship was rife with a 
festive atmosphere. Many people had heard about the event and eagerly 
waited to see the Zentradi that had won a human heart. The whole event 
was to be broadcast throughout the ship, to the UNEDC, and the Zentradi 
fleet.

Max stood before Gloval in one of the large observation lounges. Beside 
him, stood his best man, Roy Fokker. To Roy&#39;s side stood the groomsmen, 
Dietrich Johansen, and Rick Hunter. On the bride&#39;s side of the room sat 
the Zentradi defectors along with the Bridge Bunnies who had been 
reunited with Rico, Konda, and Bron. Also in a show of acceptance, 
various important people that were invited to attend were seated on this 
side. On the groom&#39;s side sat all the remaining Wild Roses and many more 
of Max&#39;s friends.

The cameras and lights came up and the wedding march began to play. 
Minmei was the first done the aisle, looking gorgeous in her steel-blue, 
formfitting dress. The dress had a metallic sheen to it that shimmered 
as she walked. She stepped up to her position across from Rick and gave 
him a wink as he gaped at her. Rick gulped hard. Next came Lisa, in a 
matching dress and looking no less beautiful depending on who you asked. 
The dress hugged her tall form down to her knees where, like Minmei&#39;s, 
it flared out and a full flounce that swung and rustled as she walked. 
Lastly came Ranma. She unintentionally made it very clear why she had 
won the title Miss Macross. She managed to eclipse the other two, 
wearing an identical dress. The dress&#39;s sweetheart neckline displayed a 
much more aggressive show of cleavage by virtue of Ranma&#39;s more generous 
bust. The dress hugged her tiny waist and clung to her full hips while 
the shimmering white satin gloves emphasized her shapely arms. No one in 
the room, except maybe Ranma herself, would have disputed who the most 
beautiful bridesmaid was.

However, though Ranma was resplendent, she was surely outshone by the 
bride herself. She wore a gown of the purest white satin and seemed to 
glow brighter than the lighting of the room could explain. At her wrists 
and at the hemline of the gown&#39;s full skirts there was a spill of 
delicate white lace. The gown had an empress waistline and hugged her 
hips, waist, and full breasts in a sleek satin embrace. The d&eacute;colletage 
went from satin to lace, just above her breasts and went to her neck in 
a demure ruffled collar. Over her freely flowing deep-green hair, was a 
full lace veil, pinned in her hair with flowers and pale pink ribbons. 
Behind her was a long train of white satin.

The entire audience caught their breath as the stunningly beautiful 
bride made her way down the aisle in proper hesitation step, but none 
more so than the groom. Max was utterly blown away as he stared 
transfixed at the goddess approaching him.

&quot;Breathe,&quot; Roy whispered to him sharply, grinning with amusement. Max 
nodded slightly and began to breathe again.

Then she was beside him, her delicate perfume filling his nostrils and 
her presence filling his senses. He barely noticed when the ceremony 
began. He tenderly lifted her veil as if unwrapping the most fabulous 
present he had ever gotten and stared, lost in her joy-filled eyes.

Some distance away, the ceremony was being monitored by Breetai and 
Exedore. They watched as Miriya and the Micronian exchanged vows with 
each other.

&quot;Exedore, don&#39;t you think that Miriya is getting carried away in her 
role as spy?&quot; Breetai asked.

&quot;Indeed, Mi&#39;lord,&quot; Exedore said thoughtfully. &quot;She looks very...happy.&quot;

&quot;So do you suspect that she too has been affected by this Micronian way 
of life?&quot; Breetai asked.

&quot;Very possible, Mi&#39;lord,&quot; Exedore agreed.

The pair shuddered as the couple in the monitor kissed tenderly, an act 
that was clearly full of emotion as tears were seen trickling down 
Miriya&#39;s face.

&quot;Dolza must be informed of this,&quot; Breetai said.

&quot;Yes, Mi&#39;lord,&quot; Exedore said. &quot;I shall send a message right away.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Meanwhile back on the space fortress, the reception was about to get 
underway. Captain Gloval stood to give a speech that he felt a little 
guilty about giving, but knew it was necessary for the good of both 
their peoples. Clinking his champagne glass with his spoon, he called 
the room to attention.

&quot;This wedding carries with it a great historical significance,&quot; Gloval 
said solemnly. &quot;As you all know, Miriya was a Zentradi warrior who 
destroyed many of our own ships. She comes from a culture that we have 
grown to fear and hate. It is the Zentradi who caused our present 
situation. They alone prevent our return to Earth, our homes and our 
beloved families. It is they who have caused destruction and endless 
suffering.

&quot;Now, I know what you are thinking, &#145;Why is he choosing this time to 
remind us of all these terrible things?&#146; I remind you of these brutal 
acts, ladies and gentlemen, because we must learn to forgive; not 
blindly, not out of ignorance, but because we are a strong and willing 
nation. We cannot blame the Zentradi for this inexplicable lust for war. 
They have never known any other way of life, and it is their only means 
of survival. Nor can we condemn the individuals of that society for the 
being born into this war machine. Instead, we must look to their good 
nature. Some have made a request to stop fighting, and I believe it is a 
genuine request. We must respond with equal integrity.

&quot;The blood of both these young people was tested before the ceremony. 
Zentradi blood was found to be exactly the same as human blood. Since it 
is apparent that we share a common ancestry, there is no reason why we 
cannot find peace and live in harmony with one another. Let this 
occasion represent a future where all people live in peaceful and 
beneficial coexistence! Each and every citizen must develop a 
responsible attitude toward the prospects of peace. We must learn from 
our mistakes. To live with different people, different nations; think of 
the challenge! I am not proposing laying down our arms, but extending 
them so that if there is a chance of a peaceful solution, we may find it 
together.

&quot;Max and Miriya, it is my hope that you share a long and wonderful life 
together and I wish to extend to you my sincerest congratulations.&quot;

Everyone in the room clapped and approved of the sentiment. However, it 
was not universally shared. While most everyone in Macross City cheered 
Gloval&#39;s speech and celebrated his leadership, there were more than a 
few that were not so willing to be so forgiving. Luckily, they were by 
far the minority.

Down on Earth, Admiral Donald Hayes growled at the monitor. &quot;Goddam 
ship,&quot; he muttered. &quot;It&#39;s like the Perverted fucking Love Boat. First 
Lisa gets married to that...that...thing and now we have men marrying 
alien freaks.&quot; He had seen his daughter standing next to the redhead he 
recognized as the one his daughter claimed to be married to. He was 
horrified to find himself thinking that the top-heavy redhead was even 
prettier than Lisa. This was, of course, before he recognized her.

Aboard Breetai&#39;s flagship, there were more mixed sentiments. Breetai and 
Exedore watched with only the vaguest notion of what the speech was 
promoting, neither able to envision a life outside of the great Zentradi 
war machine. Many of the crew however, harbored different thoughts. The 
ceremony had awakened in them long dormant human emotions and made them 
feel inexplicably happy. They found themselves longing to be with their 
friends and comrades aboard the SDF-1 to share in the evident joy that 
seemed to be so abundant there.

Unaware of any of this, the reception went on. Dinner was completed and 
the cake was cut. Max and Miriya fed the first piece to each other in a 
tender moment. Then Minmei took the small stage along with, the by now 
resigned, Ranma.

&quot;Hi everyone,&quot; Minmei said into the microphone. &quot;Ranma and I are now 
going to sing a song that we would like to dedicate to Max and Miriya. 
Miriya picked this song herself. It&#39;s a new one that I&#39;ve been working 
on with Ranma called &#39;Adesso e Fortuna&#39; and I hope you all enjoy it.&quot;

With that, the music began to play the lead in. On cue, Minmei began to 
sing.

The way that you,

Embrace me with your strong and powerful arms,

Your haunting words,

Keep me close, to everything about you.

(Ranma began to sing the second verse)

Romantic in ways,

In ways that almost tear upon my heart,

Can&#39;t let you go,

Don&#39;t you know?

(Both sang the next line before trading off the next two, Minmei first 
then Ranma and then singing the fouth line together)

Io sono prigioniera,

A captive in your gentle hands,

A prisoner of your soulful eyes,

Your special smile, we&#39;ll never part.

(They again traded off singing the lines of the next verse, Minmei first 
then Ranma)

If the morning sun should free me,

It really wouldn&#39;t let me go,

I&#39;d still be caught inside your love,

Can&#39;t rise above the chains of your heart.

(the following two verse were done the same as the previous two)

Io sono prigioniera,

A captive in your gentle hands,

A prisoner of your soulful eyes,

Your special smile, we&#39;ll never part.

If the morning sun should free me,

It really wouldn&#39;t let me go,

I&#39;d still be caught inside your love,

Can&#39;t rise above the chains of your heart.

(oO\O/Oo)
