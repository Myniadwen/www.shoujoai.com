<pre>&quot;I&#39;d be very pleased,&quot; Releena gracefully offered him the white 
envelope, &quot;if you&#39;d choose to attend my birthday party.&quot; She smiled 
gently at the mysterious young boy that she had first met on the 
beach, feeling confident that he would accept the invitation. &#39;And 
maybe then we&#39;ll become friends,&#39; she thought hopefully.

        The approving murmur of the crowd was only just dying down a 
bit as Heero Yui took the birthday invitation in his hands. With a 
single smooth gesture he tore it in two, letting the pieces fall to 
the ground as they heard a soft gasp of shock from Releena.

        Releena gazed at him in surprise, &quot;But, why...&quot;

        Before either of them could react a figure strode out of the 
crowd, walking right past where Releena was standing towards where the 
dark haired boy waited. Slap! She slapped him right across the cheek, 
her long orange hair flowing around her.

        &quot;What in the.. ?&quot; Releena looked at her in shock.

        Instead of a standard girl&#39;s uniform she wore a boy&#39;s one, 
specially tailored to fit her long thin form. There was a loud murmur 
from the crowd, both surprise and admiration as the woman looked down 
at the shorter Heero Yui.

        &quot;You should treat a lady with more respect,&quot; she said to him 
coolly.

        Releena gazed up at her in honest surprise and real 
admiration, swiftly recognizing her as the intense young woman who had 
transferred to the school only a few weeks ago. &quot;Who are you,&quot; she 
murmured to her softly.

        She had a surprisingly gentle smile, but her eyes strangely 
touched by a deep sorrow. &quot;Arisugawa Juri,&quot; was the soft answer as she 
walked away. In seconds Releena found herself surrounded by her 
friends, Heero Yui having used the distraction to slip away.
