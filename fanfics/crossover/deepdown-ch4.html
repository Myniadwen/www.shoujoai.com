	&quot;Mother, would you like me to sort through the charts for you?&quot;  Blue eyes 
looked frantically over the ever-growing stacks of folders on the doctor&#39;s 
desk.

	Pausing for a moment, Hitomi tore herself away from the chart she&#39;d been 
engrossed in and watched her daughter intently eyeing the stack of folders.

	&quot;It&#39;s quite alright dear.  If you&#39;d like though, I&#39;m sure Nurse Utashin 
needs some help down in pediatrics.&quot; The older Mizuno felt a bit guilty, as 
she watched Ami&#39;s eyes drop sadly to the ground.  &quot;Sweetheart, I know you 
and I normally do this together.  But with the pile-up, I can&#39;t afford to 
have any mistakes.&quot;

	Ami listened intently and straightened back up again, biting back any 
sadness she was feeling.  The blue haired girl smiled at her mother and 
nodded graciously.

	&quot;No problem.  I understand completely.&quot;

	Hitomi raised her eyebrows slightly, still feeling guilty.  Looking back 
down, she continued, &quot;I&#39;m glad.  I&#39;ll phone ahead to pediatrics if you 
like?&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s okay Mother.  I&#39;m going to stop by the cafeteria and get something 
to eat first.  Good luck with all of this.&quot;

	The older woman responded with a barely audible sound from her throat, as 
she threw herself back into the mass of papers and folders on the desk.  
Turning on one heel, Ami made her way briskly out of the office and didn&#39;t 
stop until she got to the elevator.

	&#39;It&#39;s okay Ami.  She&#39;s just busy, is all.  No need to get upset.  Take a 
deep breath.&#39;

	The blue-eyed girl repeated the breath&#39;s several times in uniform before 
the elevator reached her.  Stepping in, she pressed the button for the 
basement floor.  As she began to descend downwards, Ami allowed her 
shoulders to slump a little, taking a deep breath, biting on her lower lip.

	&quot;No problem.&quot;

------------------------------------------

	&quot;If you don&#39;t like it we can go to the restaurant down the street, Makoto.&quot;

	The chestnut haired girl looked up from the macaroni and cheese she&#39;d been 
stabbing at for the last several minutes, scrunching her eyebrows and 
staring right into her guardians eyes.  Green eyes seemed to consider 
something as they stared genuinely at Setsuna.

	&quot;You have something on your mind?&quot;

	The green eyes turned away at the end of the question and watched as the 
cashier dropped a several coins onto the ground.  No one seemed to notice 
though, as Makoto looked around the busy cafeteria.  Turning back to the 
older woman, Makoto seemed to exhale away her lingering thoughts.

	Taking a small breath, the teenager spoke, &quot;What is Mizuno&#39;s family like?&quot;

	Magenta eyes widened in surprise and Setsuna began to wonder just how much 
the shy, blue haired girl, affected Makoto in that short moment.

	&quot;Well, it&#39;s just Ami and her mother, as far as I know.  Mizuno-sensei and I 
have only talked in passing about her personal life, so I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t 
have any more details to present.&quot;

	Makoto nodded slowly and took a bite of her meal, making a point to chew it 
slowly.

	Setsuna waited patiently, taking a sip from her tea, until the younger girl 
swallowed and began to speak again.

	&quot;How long have you known them for?&quot;

	&quot;Many years now.  When I first met them, Ami was only just 7 years old.&quot;  
The dark haired woman smiled fondly, as she recalled the past, &quot;She really 
hasn&#39;t changed one bit.  She&#39;s still shy, has the same hair cut, and even 
the same style glasses.&quot;

	Nodding again, Makoto appeared to process the information and took a few 
more bites of the macaroni and cheese and letting the sounds of the 
cafeteria fill the void between them.  Setsuna simply took another sip of 
her tea and watched as doctors hustled in and out, nurses tailing them in 
earnest.

	&quot;I... I really hope no one dies from the accident.&quot;

	The guardian turned back to the young girl, eyeing her concernedly.  She 
had filled Makoto in about the pile-up of 20 or so cars several miles away 
from the hospital.  The cause had been a bus that lost control, slamming 
into the side of a semi trailer.  It was early morning Saturday traffic, and 
so many cars didn&#39;t have time to stop, resulting in the pile-up, and the 
panicked state of the hospital.

	Magenta eyes softened and looked directly into Makoto&#39;s emerald-green ones, 
&quot;I hope so too, Makoto.&quot;

	&#39;Everyday is a new surprise indeed.&#39;

--------------------------------------

	Setsuna would&#39;ve noticed the scene in front of her even if she had no eyes 
and was completely deaf.  She was also impressed to see several doctors who 
were previously involved in a deep conversation, probably about a patient, 
come running over to help.  Makoto&#39;s eyes had suddenly gone wide and she&#39;d 
begun to choke on the macaroni and cheese she&#39;d been taking far too long to 
eat.

	Coughing heavily, Makoto tried to convince the doctors she was okay, but 
could barely sputter out the words to do so.  The older woman, though, 
watching the situation go from frantic to controlled, allowed her eyes to 
linger to where Makoto had been looking when she began to choke.

	&#39;Ahh... I suppose I would have been surprised as well.&#39;

	At the cash register, stood a small girl, with neatly cropped blue hair, 
smiling gently as the old woman conversed with her about something or other. 
  Ami, sensing eyes on her, turned meekly towards a smiling Setsuna and a 
choking Makoto.  Quickly, the blue haired girl brought a hand up to her 
mouth, eyes widening in shock as she watched Makoto being helped by at least 
four doctors.

	Turning back, the guardian allowed her eyes to soften in concern and spoke 
gently to the young girl, &quot;Are you okay, Makoto?&quot;

	Green eyes, which were now bloodshot and watered, looked pleadingly at the 
older woman.  &quot;I&#39;m okay Meioh-san.  Really!&quot; Makoto coughed heavily once 
more and continued, &quot;We can tell these doctors to go do something 
worthwhile.&quot;

	The several young men were taken aback by the clear rudeness they&#39;d just 
received and glared at the chestnut haired girl.  One seemed to linger, 
seeming to expect a thank you and a hug at any moment, but quickly rushed 
away after Makoto turned her angered eyes on him.

	&quot;Really now, Makoto, they were simply trying to help.&quot;

	&quot;If they&#39;re going to be of any help, they need to be up there looking at 
the hoards of patients waiting in the lobby,&quot; was the curt and firm reply.

	&quot;They look pretty young though, probably starting this new career in 
medicine.  So, perhaps they&#39;re just very eager to help others.&quot;

	Green and magenta eyes looked up suddenly to see who was talking.  Makoto 
lingered for a few seconds and then quickly looked back down at the table, 
reaching nonchalantly for a glass of water.  Setsuna kept her eyes on Ami 
and smiled reassuringly at her.

	&quot;I was thinking that myself.&quot;

	Smiling shyly, the blue haired girl nodded and then turned her eyes 
concernedly to her classmate.

	&quot;Are you okay now, Makoto-san?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah yeah.  It&#39;ll take more than a couple of noodles to take me down.&quot;

	Nodding again, Ami shifted the tray gently in her hands, turning back to 
the older woman.  Blue eyes shifted uncomfortably, as though debating 
something, from Setsuna to the table to the food in her hands.

	&quot;Will you join us Ami-chan?&quot;

	Baby blue eyes seemed to wash over with relief as she dipped her head 
slightly and set the tray down next to Makoto&#39;s.  Makoto, who was busy 
indulging in drinking the water in her cup, pretended not to notice as the 
picture-perfect school girl sat quietly next to her.

	A wave of lilacs and vanilla washed over the tall girl&#39;s senses, as Ami 
positioned herself comfortably in the seat.  Makoto allowed her eyes to 
close for a moment, as she quietly inhaled the sweet smelling air around 
her.  When she opened them, she found her guardian sipping at her tea 
comfortably, watching the crowd; and Ami, Ami was shyly poking at her salad, 
taking small bites of it here and there.

	An inaudible silence flowed over the three as they sat together.

	&quot;Your mom is pretty busy today I bet?&quot;

	Blue eyes looked up to meet piercing green.

	Feeling a faint blush cross her face, Ami made her reply softly, &quot;Oh, yes.  
They&#39;re considering her for head of ER next year.  She wants to show them 
she&#39;s dependable.&quot;

	Setsuna set her teacup down swiftly and brought her elbows up to rest on 
the table, letting her head rest in her hands, &quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll make it.  
Actually, I&#39;m surprised they haven&#39;t chosen her sooner.&quot;  The older woman 
let out a rare and sweet smile towards the young, blue haired girl.

	Blushing, Ami lowered her head to stare intently at the salad before her.  
Silently, the young girl reminded herself to breathe.  It seemed she could 
not concentrate well at all today.  Ami looked up a moment and saw those 
same piercing emerald-green eyes still staring at her.  Before she could do 
anything though, green eyes looked away quickly.

	&#39;She caught me looking,&#39; Makoto thought, &#39;Ah, well, maybe I wanted her to 
catch me.&#39;

	The chestnut haired girl grinned at the thought and turned back towards her 
small companion.

	&quot;They tell me you&#39;re a genius.&quot;

	Ami thought she could not turn any more red than she already was and 
hastily shoved a bite of salad into her mouth.

	Setsuna nearly laughed at the two, but held herself together, picking the 
teacup back up.  She paused slightly before the rim of the cup got to her 
mouth, &quot;That&#39;s Makoto for you, always direct and to the point.&quot;

	Makoto turned her gaze on her guardian, raising an eyebrow in a challenging 
manner.  She watched as the older woman took a particularly drawn out sip.  
Deciding it wasn&#39;t anything worth fussing over, Makoto turned back to the 
shorter girl, waiting expectantly for an answer.

	The blue haired girl had just swallowed when those piercing green eyes 
turned back on her.  Unconsciously, Ami swallowed once more and reached for 
her glass of water.  After taking a lengthy drink, Ami looked back up again. 
  When several seconds passed, she realized Makoto was not going to back 
down, and sighed resignedly as a result.

	&quot;I... I don&#39;t... I&#39;m not a genius.  I just get good grades.&quot;

	Chestnut hair ruffled heavily as Makoto let out an airy snort.  &quot;Good 
grades are not a mark of a genius.  Anyone with half a brain knows that.  
I&#39;m talking about the national practice tests you take.  I hear that you ace 
every one of them.&quot;

	Blue eyes lowered gently and Ami allowed her face to relax a bit.  She knew 
that people talked of her at school.  It didn&#39;t bother her for the most 
part, but no one had ever directly asked her about it.  Makoto was so blunt; 
Ami didn&#39;t know whether to be happy or frightened.

	&quot;My friend, Rei, says I study too much.&quot;  Ami smiled a little too 
forcefully as she replied and Makoto and her guardian noticed it quickly.

	Silence once again settled between the two teenagers.  Both went back to 
their food, leaving a worried, but also amused Setsuna in their wake.  The 
rest of lunch was eaten quickly and quietly, with very few words being 
spoken between the three women.
