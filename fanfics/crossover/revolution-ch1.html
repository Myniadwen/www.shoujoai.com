<h1>Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Revolution (part 1 of 26)</h1>

<pre>        The next day, well before their classes started for the day 
Releena began to quietly ask around about the new transfer student. 
She quickly put together some information about the mysterious new 
student, enough to occupy her thoughts until lunch.

        From what she heard, it seemed that Arisugawa had been 
attending the prestigious Ohtori academy up until a few months ago, 
when a band of colony terrorist had attacked the place. Many of the 
students and teachers were slain, and some of the stories she heard 
mentioned that Juri&#39;s roommate was among those who had died.

        &#39;She must have been still in grieving for her friends when she 
first arrived here,&#39; Releena thought to herself glumly, sitting in the 
lunch room among the other students. Juri had held herself apart from 
other students with her odd dress and cold manner, her rescue of 
Releena coming as a great surprise. &#39;Though I wonder why I didn&#39;t 
reach out to her before?&#39; she mused.

        There was a small disturbance by the entrance, and Releena 
looked up from her thoughts to see Juri making her way over to the 
food counter, collecting her food graciously before turning back to 
gaze at the crowd. She looked around for a seat a few moments, and 
without thinking about it Releena shifted to make a bit of space at 
their table.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Juri said softly as she slid into the opening 
beside her.

        Releena smiled slightly, &quot;The seats tend to fill up very 
quickly.&quot; She was tempted to ask what had held Juri from coming to 
lunch on time, but hesitated.

        &quot;The fencing club has matches later this afternoon,&quot; Juri 
explained softly, &quot;as one of the newer members it was my 
responsibility to help set up.&quot;

        One of the other girls down the table gazed at Juri in 
surprised recognition before she blurted out, &quot;You&#39;re the Prince!&quot;

        &quot;Prince?&quot; Releena looked over at Juri curiously.

        Juri looked down at her plate with a soft sigh. &quot;A nickname 
that I seem to have acquired,&quot; she quietly admitted, &quot;after I won my 
first few fencing matches here.&quot;

        &quot;It suits you,&quot; Releena murmured, and wondered where that odd 
idea came from.

        A band of white skin on her ring finger was visible as Juri 
raised a glass, drinking smoothly before putting it back down. &quot;I hope 
I didn&#39;t embarrass you,&quot; Juri smiled at Releena slightly, &quot;by slapping 
that jerk. I just couldn&#39;t help myself.&quot;

        &quot;Oh, no,&quot; Releena blushed.

        &quot;Good,&quot; Juri finished up her meal, neatly stacking her plates.

        &quot;When are you going to be competing this afternoon?&quot; the girl 
who had first identified Juri as &#39;the Prince&#39; asked her eagerly.

        &quot;I&#39;ll be in the second set of matches,&quot; Juri answered as she 
rose to go.

        Releena even surprised herself when she quietly said, &quot;I&#39;ll 
try to be there.&quot;

        Standing concealed in another corner of the large and crowded 
lunch room Heero Yui ate an apple, watching the group talking 
thoughtfully. He had also been asking some questions about the young 
woman, but not through the normal student&#39;s network, and what he had 
found out was very interesting, to say the least.

        He knew it hadn&#39;t been any colony terrorists who had destroyed 
the woman&#39;s school, no matter what the official press releases said. 
It had been a strike by OZ, probably a attempt to root out a possible 
source of resistance. There were some odd stories about the school, 
and strangely the leader of OZ was said to have gone there.

        Heero dropped that train of thought, knowing it was mostly 
irrelevant to the current situation. &#39;I could have evaded that slap,&#39; 
he admitted, &#39;but not without drawing too much attention to myself and 
what I can really do.&#39; This Arisugawa Juri was clearly quite 
physically capable, and from what he had been able to lip-read, she 
was a fencer.

        He pushed himself off his position against the wall and made 
his way towards the exit. &#39;I think I&#39;ll enter the matches this 
afternoon,&#39; he thought, &#39;and see how good she really is.&#39;

        Time passed slowly in classes, and by the afternoon Arisugawa 
Juri was almost eager to begin the fencing. She limbered herself up, 
stretching out dressed in her white fencing uniform. The fencing hall 
itself was cool, and surprisingly the stands were filled with young 
men and women.

        &#39;Mostly women,&#39; Juri found herself noting.

        Sitting near the front row were all the girls from the lunch 
table, including the young woman whom she had stood up for with that 
rude young man. &#39;Releena,&#39; Juri had discovered the girl&#39;s name, and 
how well known she was in the school.

        When she had seen the clearly contemptuous way that the boy 
had torn that invitation apart, Juri had just seen red. Without even 
thinking about it she had forced her way through the crowd and then 
struck him across the cheek. She had met his eyes and felt a chill at 
the deadness in them, the utter lack of any human feeling.

        &#39;What does that to a person?&#39; Juri found herself wondering, 
&#39;What can kill the soul so completely?&#39; She looked up from her 
troubling thoughts to gaze at her first opponent, and it didn&#39;t even 
seem a surprise.

        Heero Yui met her eyes steadily, &quot;We meet again.&quot;

        &quot;So we do,&quot; Juri quietly agreed.

        At the referee&#39;s signal Juri slid her protective mask on, as 
did Heero. &quot;Ready,&quot; the referee raised up a hand, then crisply yelled, 
&quot;Begin!&quot;

        With a bright flash of silver their foils met, separated, and 
then met once again as they gazed at each other intently, searching 
for any sign of weakness in their opponent. The two figures were like 
statues, waiting for any opening to strike.

        &#39;He&#39;s good,&#39; Juri admitted.

        Like a shot he moved, their blades tangling up as they stepped 
in close. &quot;Not bad,&quot; Heero admitted, pressing to push her backwards.

        Snap!

        Heero&#39;s blade broke off, the one end flying away from the 
crowd luckily, but Heero pressed on. Using what was left of his blade 
he tried to twist Juri&#39;s foil right out of her hands, but she stepped 
back to avoid the maneuver. Swiftly he lunged for her head, trying to 
drive the sharpened, broken point of his blade towards her face clear 
guard, but with remarkable speed she turned it aside, then touching 
him just above the heart.

        &quot;Point, Arisugawa! Arisugawa wins,&quot; the referee declared.

        &quot;Good match,&quot; Juri took her helm off, shaking her head to free 
her long hair before offering him her hand.

        Heero looked down at her hand and smiled slightly. He just 
turned away from her outstretched hand and then walked away silently.
