<a href="../crossover/sillyass-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>        Arisugawa Juri, the acting president of the Ohtori school 
council and therefore the closest person to actually being in charge, 
looked over at the group of technicians, senshi, goddesses and 
sorcerers and asked, &quot;You can get us all... home?&quot;

        &quot;The math looks about right,&quot; Washu agreed enthusiastically, 
&quot;but the only way to be completely certain is to try it.&quot;

        &quot;Which brings up the rather difficult question,&quot; Rei Ayanami 
said to them all quietly, &quot;do we really want to do this?&quot;

        Juri met Ami&#39;s eyes, and she smiled at her gently. Juri sighed 
softly, &quot;To be perfectly honest, I really don&#39;t want you to do this. 
But I&#39;m not willing to screw up hundreds of lives just to preserve my 
own bit of happiness.&quot;

        &quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; Ami smiled up at Juri sadly as she continued, 
&quot;we need to do this, to fix what we all set into motion.&quot;

        Setsuna gave them all approving looks, then she looked over at 
Washu and Yume, &quot;How soon can you get it all set up?&quot;

        &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; Yume replied instantly.

        &quot;Then if you don&#39;t mind,&quot; Juri took Ami&#39;s hand and gently 
pulled her to her feet, &quot;I&#39;m going to spend tonight with my 
girlfriend.&quot;

        &quot;One final night,&quot; Ami murmured.

        As the two of them left the already bustling observatory they 
saw that a party atmosphere had developed across the entire school, a 
massive celebration quickly getting under way. They were all clearly 
happy at the prospect of going home, but there was also the sad 
knowledge that all the newformed friendships here were now coming to 
an end.

        The Ohtori security team was gathered on one side, having a 
drinking party. Lt. Noin pored for Lady Une, Natsumi and Miyuki 
cuddled, Leona and the Puma sisters were dancing drunkenly, and Motoko 
Kusanagi was sitting talking with Shiori quietly.

        The tech club was helping Yume and Washu assemble something 
very big nearby the observatory itself. Noa Izumi, Mackie, Sylia 
Stingray, Duo Maxwell, and many of the other members labored away, 
talking cheerfully and slinging down the sake. Nearby, Rei Ayanami and 
Asuka Langley cuddled together, talking softly.

        &quot;Hopefully they don&#39;t get too drunk building that,&quot; Ami 
murmured to Juri, &quot;or I don&#39;t know what might happen.&quot;

        &quot;Remind we to spike their booze,&quot; Juri grinned.

        &quot;Usagi,&quot; Rei Hino yelled, running up behind the little blonde.

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Usagi blinked. smiling happily.

        &quot;Go grab Mamoru,&quot; Rei said to her crisply, &quot;we&#39;re going to do 
a threesome.&quot;

        &quot;What?!&quot; Usagi blurted out, looking up at Rei in surprise. It 
was clear from the look on her face she thought she was hearing 
things..

        &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to,&quot; Rei squeezed her hand gently, &quot;and 
after tomorrow we probably won&#39;t remember any of this anyway.&quot;

        &quot;Hai,&quot; Usagi agreed weakly as Rei dragged her off.

        &quot;I bet there&#39;s going to be a lot of that going on tonight,&quot; a 
smiling Juri noted as the two of them walked off together.

        &quot;Usagi, Rei and Mamoru?&quot; Ami was blushing furiously.

        Juri had to laugh, softly.

        Not too far from where the tech club was working, a dark 
haired young lady was approaching an older girl. &quot;Megumi?&quot; Skuld asked 
softly.

        Megumi Morisato turned, giving the young goddess a smile, 
&quot;Yeah?&quot;

        &quot;I was wondering...&quot; Skuld blushed, &quot;I mean, I...&quot;

        Megumi&#39;s eyes widened slightly. &quot;I never realized.&quot; She 
blushed a bit, too, &quot;But you&#39;re a little young for me, Skuld.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s not really a problem.&quot; Skuld shimmered, the girl 
growing as she soon matched Megumi&#39;s height and age. &quot;Is this better?&quot; 
she asked.

        &quot;Much,&quot; and the two walked off together.

        All over the school the party continued onward, going on long 
into the night. The morning came much too early for most of them, 
suffering from hangovers and a painful sense of leave taking, growing 
stronger by the moment.

        &quot;Let&#39;s get this done,&quot; Juri said. As Ami was about to leave 
her side Juri squeezed those fingers gently, &quot;I won&#39;t forget you.&quot;

        &quot;Not I, you,&quot; Ami agreed before joining the group.

        The Moon Princess stood up on a central platform in the 
device, the Silver Crystal glowing brightly in her hands. In a circle 
around her stood the three Goddesses Urd, Belldandy and Skuld acting 
in their roles of past, present and future. Scattered all around the 
device were Ryouko, Ayeka, Tenchi, the Sailor Senshi, Lina Inverse, 
Naga, Filla and other beings of power, all contributing their energies 
to power the great device.

        The power levels built up, then Washu stepped up, grabbed the 
central lever and yanked it down as she cried out to the others, 
&quot;NOW!&quot;

        Juri met Ami&#39;s eyes a final moment... then the world dissolved 
into pure white light...

        Juri awoke alone, her bed feeling oddly cold. &quot;Ami,&quot; she 
murmured softly, reaching for the other girl. But her side of the bed 
was empty, no sign left that she had ever been there. &quot;Guess it 
worked,&quot; Juri murmured to herself sadly.

        It was hard to even motivate herself to get out of bed, but 
Juri forced herself to do it. She dressed, pulling on her student 
council uniform even as she idly wondered if she was still president. 
She hoped not. The walk to classes was hard, but Juri tried her best 
not to show it.

        &quot;Juri!&quot; the voice cried, &quot;Juri-san!&quot;

        Turning, her eyes wide with shock, Juri saw Ami Mizuno running 
up to her. She swept the smaller girl into her arms, holding her 
close. They stood there like that a few moments before Juri finally 
had to ask, &quot;How?&quot;

        Ami drew back from her hug a bit, &quot;We couldn&#39;t separate all of 
the timelines, not without doing immense damage to some of the worlds. 
So we merged them instead!&quot;

        Juri looked around, recognizing the faces of some of the 
students at last. Keichii and his friends, Usagi and the others, A-ko, 
B-ko and C-ko, and dozens of others. &quot;But the place isn&#39;t mobbed like 
before,&quot; Juri managed.

        &quot;Everyone who belonged in the past or the future were sent 
back there, that helped,&quot; Ami smiled slightly. She took a nervous 
breath, &quot;And a bunch of us ended up in Ohtori, rather than Tokyo. Is 
that all right?&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s wonderful,&quot; Juri pulled her close, kissing her happily.

The End!

Author&#39;s Note: Well, I hope this ending doesn&#39;t disappoint anyone too 
terribly badly. I&#39;m leaving the door wide open to continue this, so if 
I feel like it, I can jump right back onto it again anytime. As to why 
I&#39;m ending it now, to be honest I&#39;ve become much more focused on my 
two &#39;serious&#39; cross-over series Arisugawa&#39;s Locket and Eternal City, 
Crystal Tokyo, and less interested in writing this one. Instead of 
risking my pumping out a bunch of substandard chapters to keep it 
going, I thought I&#39;d end while the story was still pretty good. I just 
hope that everyone enjoyed the ride. If you liked this fic, review, if 
you didn&#39;t review anyway, I&#39;ll just ignore it.
