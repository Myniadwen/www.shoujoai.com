<h1>Revenge Road (part 8 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/revroad-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>&quot;Fortress One, this is Izzy Randal,&quot; she said, the
green trimmed veritech soaring gracefully above them,
&quot;requesting permission to land.&quot;

&quot;This is Fortress One,&quot; Vanessa Laird answered calmly,
&quot;permission granted.&quot; There was a pause, &quot;Is Commander
Hayes aboard?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Lisa used her helmet radio to jump in to
the conversation. The brown haired officer smiled
slightly as she dryly added, &quot;The reports of my being
assigned away from here were greatly exaggerated.&quot;

&quot;Glad to hear that,&quot; Kim Young agreed even as she
checked the status board. &quot;Lane is open, you&#39;re free
to land.&quot;

A few minutes later and the canopy of Izzy&#39;s fighter
was opening even as the elevator lift brought them
down into the guts of Fortress One. The mammoth super
aircraft carrier was several times the size of any
aircraft carrier ever built, containing living
quarters, repair facilities and much more for it&#39;s
veritechs and destroids.

&quot;Well I&#39;ll be...looks like we&#39;ve been invaded,&quot; Izzy
softly murmured as she saw the pink and white autobot
who was moving about the massive chamber beneath the
deck, lead by Captain Claudia Grant.

&quot;Not invaded,&quot; Lisa said to her firmly but quietly,
&quot;she is our new Autobot liason officer, you know.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Izzy smiled as she unclipped her helmet,
calmly tucking it under her arm as they neared.
&quot;Captain,&quot; she saluted.

Claudia returned it, the dusky skinned officer smiling
slightly as she said, &quot;Welcome back, you two. How did
it go?&quot;

&quot;About as well as could be expected,&quot; Lisa smiled
wryly. She looked up, &quot;Nice to see you again, Arcee.
Any problems getting aboard?&quot;

&quot;None, ma&#39;am,&quot; Arcee answered, her lips raising up in
a slight smile, &quot;we met as planned and I jumped
aboard.&quot; She looked over at Izzy, &quot;You&#39;re certainly
looking better than the last time I saw you, officer
Randal.&quot;

&quot;Izzy,&quot; she corrected with a strained smile. &quot;And
yeah, considering I was nearly a drowned rat that
time...&quot;

&quot;But you were a heroic drowned rat,&quot; Arcee teased.

&quot;Heh,&quot; Claudia fought back a smile. She looked up at
Arcee, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to say I&#39;ve shown you all the places
that your robot mode can fit. The rest of the ship
isn&#39;t quite large enough for you to walk through.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Arcee nodded.

Izzy nearly suggested that Arcee go to car mode, since
she probably could make it through some of the
corridors that way, but held back. For all she knew,
Claudia didn&#39;t want Arcee to see any more of the
vessel.

&quot;Well,&quot; Lisa said briskly, &quot;I need to get out of this
uniform.&quot; Silently she added, &#39;And find a bathroom. I
was too annoyed to look for one earlier...&#39;

&quot;And I need to go have the doc take another look at
me,&quot; Izzy sighed. &quot;I promised I would, in exchange for
flying Commander Hayes out.&quot;

&quot;Good Luck,&quot; Arcee said, &quot;if your doctor is anything
like our Ratchet, you&#39;re not getting away without some
poking and prodding.&quot;

&quot;Ain&#39;t that the truth,&quot; Izzy agreed as she and Lisa
headed off.

&quot;Nicely done,&quot; Lisa murmured, &quot;you were even civil
towards her.&quot;

Izzy shrugged slightly, &quot;Well she did save my life.
It&#39;s kind of hard to be snarky to her, under the
circumstances.&quot;

They reached the locker room, where both of them
stripped off their flight suits and Lisa ducked out
for a bathroom break. &quot;Welcome back, ma&#39;am,&quot; the
trainee pilot said, her red hair falling into her
eyes.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Izzy nodded, looking at her name tag,
&quot;Ensign Isavia.&quot;

&quot;Lana Isavia,&quot; the young woman gave a slightly distant
smile as she added, &quot;formerly with the military
police.&quot;

&quot;Destroid pilot?&quot; Izzy wondered as she smoothly
stripped off her flihgt suit and got out a fresh
uniform from her locker.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Lana nodded eagerly as she continued,
&quot;though I&#39;m hoping to become a veritech pilot
eventually.&quot;

&quot;Well, good luck,&quot; Izzy said as she adjusted her
uniform collar.

Lisa entered, walking over to the locker her own
uniform was waiting in. Her eyes widened a little on
seeing Lana, then gave her a frosty smile. &quot;Officer
Isavia,&quot; she said flatly, &quot;it&#39;s been a long time.&quot;

Lana winced slightly. &quot;Commander Hayes,&quot; she saluted
then nodded to Izzy, &quot;excuse me.&quot; With that she left,
retreating at a quick pace.

&quot;What was that about?&quot; Izzy had to ask.

Lisa sighed softly as she explained, &quot;Before coming
here, Isavia was with the military police, at a base I
was on.&quot;

Izzy joked, &quot;And she busted you for something?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Lisa&#39;s smile was utterly without humor, &quot;she
posed as a friend while relaying reports on my life to
my father.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re kidding me,&quot; Izzy looked startled.

&quot;No,&quot; Lisa shook her head, &quot;apparently one of her
reports got mislaid and Claudia found it before
passing it on to me.&quot;

Izzy shook her head, &quot;And she seems like such a nice
kid, too.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s a very good actress,&quot; Lisa agreed.

Meanwhile, Fortress One changed course, moving close
enough to shore to worry a few crew members. Up on the
deck Claudia yelled over the sound of the surf, &quot;If
you prefer, we could use a veritech in guardian mode
to lift you off.&quot;

Arcee shook her head as the Autobot crouched on the
deck, readying herself. &quot;It should be fine,&quot; she said
firmly.

&quot;All right,&quot; Claudia said, &quot;but be careful.&quot;

&quot;Always,&quot; Arcee smiled.

With a single fluid motion the transformer threw
herself off the deck and towards the shore, her body
shifting as she did so. By the time she hit the ground
she was in car mode, and with a thump she was off, the
pink sports car cruising away.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever get used to that,&quot; Claudia
muttered, shaking her head.

Coming up behind her Lana waited a moment, then
politely said, &quot;Captain?&quot;

&quot;Isavia,&quot; Claudia nodded as she turned to the younger
woman. Seeing the faintly pained look on her face
claudia continued, &quot;Let me guess, you ran into
Commander Hayes before I could talk to her.&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Lana sighed.

Claudia sighed softly. &quot;I love the woman like a
sister, but she can certainly nurse a grudge,&quot; she
remarked. &quot;I&#39;ll try to find a way to break it to her
that you&#39;ve left her father&#39;s faction in the RDF.&quot;

&quot;She has every reason to distrust me, ma&#39;am,&quot; Lana
noted respectfully. She looked out at the ocean in
determination, &quot;I suppose I&#39;ll just have to earn her
trust.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Claudia said, &quot;you may need it.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Lana smiled wryly.</pre>
