<a href="../crossover/shadowcat-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>&quot;This is not the sort of place that I&#39;d expect you to
go,&quot; Drake Anderson remarked mildly as they stood at
the door of what could only generously be called a
dive.

The bar was in the middle of a bad part of town, the
occasional drunk still sleeping away a night of hard
drinking in corners and alleys. The sign above the
door was a bit battered, the place giving an overall
sense of disrepair. In the afternoon sun it looked
like the sort of place that you probably wouldn&#39;t
admit visiting to your friends.

&quot;Not my style,&quot; Kitty agreed, the black leather clad
young woman giving him a smile, &quot;but it is the sort of
place Yukio might hang out.&quot;

Yomiko didn&#39;t comment, busy reading some of the adult
business cards stuck in the seams around a phone booth
nearby. &quot;That&#39;s interesting,&quot; the blushing woman shook
her head, her brown hair swinging as she turned back
to feel Kitty and Drake&#39;s amused looks on her. &quot;What?&quot;
she asked, pushing up her glasses.

&quot;Never mind,&quot; Drake shook his head with a sigh. &quot;Shall
we go in?&quot; the muscular blonde haired man said with a
wry smile.

From the concealment of a nearby rooftop a woman
dressed in old fashioned clothes watched, her short
brown hair fluttering around her. &quot;This is Amelia,&quot;
she softly said into the small communications device
that she carried, &quot;it looks like they&#39;re about to
enter one of your template&#39;s usual haunts.&quot;

Soft swearing came from the other end. &quot;I&#39;m heading
out there,&quot; she said firmly, &quot;I&#39;m not skulking around
them any longer.&quot;

&quot;But our orders are...,&quot; Amelia started.

&quot;Our orders be damned,&quot; she answered, &quot;I want my shot
at Pryde!&quot; With that the link was cut off with a
squeal of static.

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Amelia muttered, her brown wings swiftly
stretching out from her back. She glided carefully
down to street level, intent on keeping an eye on them
until her associate arrived.

Kitty pushed the door open, the scent of cigarette
smoke wafting past as they went in. Everyone in the
bar turned to look at them, the men and women
cautiously watching them enter. They paced by occupied
tables, a pool game going on in the back. There was a
soft sound, steel sliding on steel in the near silence
and the three stopped.

&quot;I really wouldn&#39;t recommend doing that,&quot; Kitty said
conversationally, &quot;or you&#39;ll be eating for the rest of
your life with the other hand.&quot;

A long moment of silence and they could hear the knife
being slipped away. &quot;Not bad,&quot; Drake remarked mildly.

&quot;Logan taught me everything I know,&quot; Kitty answered.

&quot;Got that right,&quot; a amused woman&#39;s voice called out.
She was perched on a stool by the bar, the slim woman
wearing a leather jacket and long black pants. She
moved across the bar with catlike grace, looking Kitty
and her allies over, &quot;Friends of yours, Kitten?&quot;

&quot;Yukio,&quot; Kitty smiled back at her cautiously, &quot;it&#39;s
been awhile.&quot; She waved to her companions, &quot;I&#39;d like
you to meet Drake and Yomiko.&quot;

&quot;Hello,&quot; Yomiko beamed.

Yukio ignored that as she gave the two a thoughtful
look, a mysterious little smile teasing her lips. She
casually reached over to stroke the false leather that
made up Kitty&#39;s outfit as she purred, &quot;Nice costume,
but it isn&#39;t quite your style.&quot;

Yomiko stiffened, eyes narrowing as she saw Yukio so
casually stroking Kitty&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Easy,&quot; Drake
murmured, holding her back.

Yukio saw that and removed her hand, murmuring, &quot;Well,
isn&#39;t that interesting.&quot; She tilted her head to the
side as she looked at Kitty, &quot;I kind of doubt this is
a social call.&quot;

&quot;I need some information,&quot; Kitty confessed.

&quot;Then let&#39;s go to my office,&quot; Yukio chuckled, leading
them across the bar with a swing of her hips. The
table was over in a corner, secluded from the rest of
the bar and shielded from direct line of sight. &quot;Grab
a seat,&quot; she waved them to sit.

Yomiko sat beside Kitty to block Yukio, bringing a
soft chuckle from the other woman. Her humor seemed to
fade away as Kitty quietly explained some of the
details of &#39;Ogun&#39;s survival, leaving out any details
about the Library.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Yukio muttered, sitting back casually in her
chair. She drank some of her mug of beer, looking over
at them thoughtfully. &quot;I haven&#39;t heard anything about
him,&quot; she conceded, &quot;though I did have a odd job
recently.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Drake raised an eyebrow.

&quot;It was supposed to be a standard in and out
operation,&quot; Yukio related, &quot;but there was some
weirdness related to it.&quot; She chuckled, &quot;The guy
wanted a blood sample, for some reason.&quot; There was a
long beat of silence as she asked them, &quot;What?&quot;

Kitty and Yomiko exchanged a look, silently asking who
was going to tell her. With a tired sigh Drake took it
out of their hands as he said, &quot;If this is who we
think it is, he may be doing some... dangerous stuff
with that blood sample.&quot;

Yukio sighed, &quot;This is more of that X-Men related
stuff, then?&quot; She looked at Drake with an oddly
predatory look, &quot;And who&#39;s he, &#39;Buff&#39; man?&quot;

&quot;No, but he is married,&quot; Drake answered gruffly.

&quot;Pity,&quot; Yukio sighed. With that she calmly began to
relate details of her supposed &#39;in and out&#39; job,
including who hired her and the item she was to steal.

&quot;Amelia Earheart&#39;s clothes?&quot; Kitty blinked, looking
thoughtful.

&quot;It does fit the pattern,&quot; Yomiko quietly noted,
&quot;there were several great figures of history we faced
previously.&quot;

A figure entered the bar and Yukio smoothly slipped
from her seat, pausing only to run a hand across
Drake&#39;s broad shoulders. &quot;Business,&quot; she nodded to the
woman who had walked in, &quot;but if you need my help,
contact me.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kitty nodded as the three of them moved off
towards the entrance, talking so that others couldn&#39;t
easily hear.

&quot;She seemed oddly familiar with you,&quot; Yomiko frowned
at Kitty then looked over at Drake, &quot;but why was she
so... with him?&quot;

&quot;My rugged good looks?&quot; Drake offered with a slight
smile as they left the bar, finding the alley beyond
oddly deserted.

Kitty chuckled softly, &quot;That, and she&#39;s supposed to be
bisexual.&quot; Yomiko gave her an odd look and Kitty
shrugged, &quot;Logan probably was more than friends with
her and a female friend of mine is awfully... cagey
about talking about her time with Yukio.&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; Yomiko was blushing furiously.

&quot;Hsssss!&quot; It leapt out from the shadows before any of
them could react, a slim figure that was sheathed head
to toe in midnight black fur. Claws flashed in the
sunlight as she attacked, moving with inhuman speed
and agility.

&quot;Ahh!&quot; Kitty&#39;s cheek blossomed red as three streaks
appeared, phasing fast enough to evade the second
blow. They stood still a second and Kitty reached up
to wipe away the blood on her face. &quot;Yukio?&quot; she
asked.

She straightened up, smiling so that fangs gleamed
slightly between her lips. In the light she looked
almost human,. black fur coating a decadently naked
body. Her eyes glowed golden, but her most inhuman
feature was the long black cat&#39;s tail that lashed
against the back of her legs.

&quot;It&#39;ll do for a name,&quot; she smiled, Yukio-cat almost
purring as she said, &quot;but I&#39;m so much more than that
human.&quot; Her eyes narrowed, &quot;Or you, Pryde!&quot;

Yukio-cat leapt but this time Kitty was ready,
blocking her attack smoothly. They fought back and
forth in the dim alley, moves from many martial arts
being used against each other. Yukio-cat had the
advantage in speed and agility but Kitty refused to
give any ground, taking the occasional hit to lash out
at her opponent.

&quot;Let me help...,&quot; Yomiko started.

&quot;No,&quot; Kitty blocked a blow with her forearm, &quot;don&#39;t
interfere!&quot;

Suddenly gunfire rang out, Yukio-cat leaping away
nervously. The woman stood in the mouth of the alley,
her brown wings stretched out, pistols from nearly
fifty years ago in each of her hands. &quot;We&#39;ll have to
settle this some other time,&quot; Amelia kept her guns on
the three as she continued, &quot;it&#39;s time to go, Yukio!&quot;

&quot;Let me finish this, damn you,&quot; Yukio hissed at
Amelia.

&quot;We&#39;re under orders,&quot; Amelia kept a wary eye on Kitty
and the others as she said firmly, &quot;I&#39;ll force you to
go with me if I have to.&quot;

&quot;All right, damn you,&quot; Yukio-cat ran at Amelia as the
woman rose into the air. She leap, catching Amelia&#39;s
hand as the two woman smoothly rose into the air.
&quot;This isn&#39;t over, Pryde,&quot; she yelled as they
disappeared behind a building.

Drake had his gun out, searching for a target as soon
as they took off, a few shots ringing out without much
success. &quot;Damn,&quot; he scowled and lowered his arms
before looking to where Yomiko was fussing over Kitty.

&quot;Looks like Sinister didn&#39;t stop with just the Ijin,&quot;
Yomiko noted softly. She pulled a cloth from her
pocket to dab gently at Kitty&#39;s cuts as she asked, &quot;Do
you think that was Amelia Earheart?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;d better contact the Library,&quot; Kitty blushed as
Yomiko&#39;s faint scent washed over her, &quot;Joker is going
to want to know about this.&quot;</pre>
