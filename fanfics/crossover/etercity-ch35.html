<a href="../crossover/etercity-ch34.html">Back to Part 34</a><pre>First Fang Zaran looked at Ran with a bit of regret
as the felenoid said, &quot;So, you are leaving us so
soon?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Ran Mizuno gave the Knanite version of a
salute, &quot;but I think it&#39;s time I returned to my birth
home.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not unexpected,&quot; Zaran conceded.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Ran asked as the blue haired woman younger
raised an eyebrow.

Zaran gave one of his people&#39;s smiles, careful not to
show his sharp fangs. &quot;You were always careful not to
speak of your parents, almost as if you were concerned
what emotion might show,&quot; he pointed out.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Ran said with some embarrassment.

&quot;You have fought well,&quot; Zaran said, &quot;and it will not
be forgotten, Fang Mizuno. I am sorry you are leaving
the Knanite now that your term of service is over, but
I hope that you will return to visit your comrades
once again.&quot;

&quot;I plan to,&quot; Ran smiled.

Zaran chuckled softly, &quot;And my pilots will likely
have plenty of that sake you&#39;ve corrupted them into
liking.&quot;

&quot;They liked drinking before I came along,&quot; Ran said
in her defense.

&quot;But not that liquid fire you like,&quot; Zaran countered.
He laughed again, &quot;I&#39;m just glad you never introduced
them to that whiskey you shared with me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m saving that for the farewell party,&quot; Ran
smirked.

Zaran looked at her worriedly a moment then realized
she was joking. He rose and offered his hands in a
human gesture, drawing his claws back. &quot;Good-bye,
Ran,&quot; he said quietly.

Ran took Zaran&#39;s hand and shook it, touched that he
learned the gesture. &quot;Farewell Zaran,&quot; she answered,
&quot;it&#39;s been an honor to know you.&quot;

Outside the office Ran reached up to wipe at the
corner of her eye, sniffling slightly. It was hard
leaving here, she had made a lot of friends, but she
also felt certain that it was time to go home. Walking
through the orbital battlestation she returned to her
quarters to pick up her duffel bag, looking around the
now empty room fondly. The rest of her stuff had been
shipped ahead days ago, now all that was left was her
essentials and a few items she considered precious to
her.

Glad that her fellow pilots were on sweep patrol Ran
headed for the docks, striding along easily even with
the heavier gravity. A attendant looked up, her sable
fur gleaming as she purred, &quot;Hello, Ran.&quot;

&quot;Za&#39;tair,&quot; Ran nodded, a faint blush coloring her
cheeks as she felt the woman&#39;s eyes roam over her. She
had made her interest in Ran known from the start,
despite the differences between their species and
seemed unbothered by Ran&#39;s refusals.

&quot;I regret that you are leaving us, beautiful one,&quot;
Za&#39;tair said with a surprisingly cute pout, reaching
out to caress her cheek.

&quot;You know I don&#39;t go that way,&quot; Ran caught her hand
gently.

&quot;A loss to us both, I&#39;m sure,&quot; Za&#39;tair sighed,
drawing her hand back. She looked at Ran curiously,
&quot;Did you pass word to your home you are returning?&quot;

&quot;Well yes,&quot; Ran blinked, wondering about the sudden
question.

&quot;It seems that you won&#39;t be taking a commercial craft
home,&quot; Za&#39;tair looked amused, &quot;they sent you a ride,
it seems.&quot;

Ran narrowed her eyes and said flatly, &quot;Really.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Za&#39;tair activated a monitor mounted on the
wall, showing a image of space outside the station.
The ship floated in space, a half circle observation
dome in the middle of angular crystal formations,
looking almost like some deadly sculpture.

&quot;Ryo-Ohki?&quot; Ran blurted.

Almost as soon as Ran came aboard via transport
sphere Princess Ayeka said, &quot;It wasn&#39;t your parents&#39;
idea for us to pick you up.&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t going to ask that,&quot; Ran smiled, &quot;at least
not yet.&quot;

The blue and purple haired child in Ayeka&#39;s arms
urped softly, then the baby snuggled close. &quot;Sorry,&quot;
Ayeka smiled as they rose through a crystal spire to
the bridge, &quot;I thought I should get asking the
question out of the way, first.&quot;

Ran just chuckled. &quot;Did you and Ryouko finally...&quot;
she nodded towards the child.

&quot;Yes, finally,&quot; Ayeka agreed as she cuddled the boy
close, &quot;we put our foot down and Tenchi agreed to
release us from diplomatic duties for a few decades.&quot;
She saw Ran flinch and sighed, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I forgot.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Ran waved it off as she added
bitterly, &quot;I just wish my parents had possessed that
kind of good sense.&quot;

&quot;The circumstances weren&#39;t the same,&quot; Ayeka noted as
they reached the bridge, &quot;your parents were working to
head off a war.&quot;

&quot;War?&quot; Ran blurted in surprise, not having heard this
before.

&quot;Welcome aboard,&quot; Ryouko nodded from where she stood
in the center of the bridge, the blue haired space
pirate surrounded by the floating crystals that were
Ryo-Ohki&#39;s computer system. &quot;Has Ayeka introduced
little Yosho yet?&quot;

&quot;Not be name,&quot; Ran said, mind occupied by Ayeka&#39;s
earlier revelation. &quot;What do you mean, war?&quot; she asked
the princess.

&quot;The Earth colonies that were pulling out had been
provided arms from both Mesa and a renegade Jurai lord
looking to cause trouble he could capitalize on,&quot;
Ayeka explained, &quot;if they resolved to pull out by
force things would have been very messy.&quot;

&quot;And with one of our lords involved it had to be kept
secret,&quot; Ryoko said, &quot;for fear of a major diplomatic
incident.&quot;

&quot;My parents were probably waiting til I was older
before they told me,&quot; Ran mused softly, &quot;but I ran
away before they could do so.&quot;

&quot;Probably,&quot; Ayeka agreed... just as the baby woke
with a lusty cry.

&quot;Jeeze,&quot; Ran stepped back reflexedly.

Ryouko winced visibly, &quot;The kid always wakes up
hungry.&quot;

&quot;Let me,&quot; Ayeka promptly pulled back her kimono to
reveal a full breast and pulled the baby close.
Instantly the child quited as he began sucking down
milk.

Ran turned away with a blush and excused herself,
walking over to Ryouko&#39;s side. &quot;So how long till we
get to Earth?&quot; she asked, her voice only cracking a
bit with nervousness.

Ryouko looked amused, &quot;A few hours, tops.&quot; She
dropped her voice, &quot;Does it bother you that much?&quot;

&quot;I remember being around when Erica and Usagi were
growing up,&quot; Ran said dryly, &quot;I hated babysitting not
to mention diaper changing.&quot;

Ryouko laughed, &quot;We&#39;ll try not to inflict that on
you, I promise.&quot; She smirked, &quot;Besides, with Sasami
and Minagi on Earth we&#39;ll have all the help we need.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Ran admitted.

Ayeka adjusted her robes as she returned to their
side, cradling the baby in the crook of her arm. &quot;All
done,&quot; she announced cheerfully.

Yosho looked around cheerfully, his expression oddly
unfocused, then after a few moments and a loud burp he
curled up in the crook of her arm. &quot;I wonder how long
he&#39;ll just eat and sleep?&quot; Ryouko wondered, gazing at
him fondly.

&quot;If I remembver right, and assuming human and Jurai
babies are alike,&quot; Ran offered after a moment, &quot;it&#39;ll
be a while before he can really do much.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ayeka said warmly. Her expression looked
thoughtful, &quot;I wonder if I should call on your parents
for advice once we get to Earth?&quot;

Ran thought of her early days, and how much she had
enjoyed that time. It had only been once she grew
older that her parents had started disapointing her...
&quot;Yes, I think they&#39;d be good at that,&quot; she agreed.

&quot;Myah!&quot; Ryo-Ohki said, one of the crystal shards that
made up the ship&#39;s mind clenched in Yosho&#39;s little
fist. Strangely the ship didn&#39;t seem to mind that
treatment very much.

Ran offered her own finger and waved it in front of
Yosho, delighting in the child&#39;s attempts to grab it.
&quot;Get a room at the palace,&quot; she suggested, &quot;you&#39;ll
have a army of honorary aunts and uncles willing to
help.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll probably do that,&quot; Ryouko laughed.

Ayeka gave Ran a searching look, &quot;And do you plan to
stay at the Palace this time, too?&quot;

Ran gave them both a mildly suspicious look. &quot;Okay,&quot;
she asked, &quot;who caught you both up on Palace gossip?&quot;

&quot;My sister Minagi,&quot; Ryouko confessed.

&quot;Tenchi via Serenity,&quot; Ayeka answered promptly.

&quot;It&#39;s a plot,&quot; Ran rolled her eyes with a sigh.

&quot;You&#39;re surrounded by meddlers,&quot; Ryouko agreed
cheerfully.

To be continued....

Notes: This continues the Ran storyline from chapter
twenty-one, as well as picking up the Ryouko/Ayeka
baby idea I floated in a earlier chapter. Yosho is the
name of Ayeka&#39;s brother, who was also the grandfather
of Tenchi.</pre>
