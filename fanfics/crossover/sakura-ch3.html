<h1>Revolutionary Girl Sakura (part 3 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/sakura-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Sakura and Juri arrived at the gym, Tomoyo close behind, filming 
madly. &quot;Does she always do that?&quot; Juri asked quietly.

&quot;Yep. So who am I supposed to meet?&quot; Sakura asked. Juri looked around, 
then waved over a handsome young man. Sakura and Tomoyo both stared as 
he walked towards him: he was short, blue haired, and very cute. All 
in all, he cut a fine figure in his fencing uniform. And, according to 
Juri, anybody who got close to him lately had a serious accident.

&quot;Sakura, Tomoyo, meet Kaoru Miki.&quot; Juri said with a smile. Miki 
extended his hand, and Sakura took it, nearly freezing as she felt 
that familiar tingle. There was a Card, all right, but it didn&#39;t feel 
like it was hiding in him. Someone around him, maybe? Sakura thought.

&quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you, Miki.&quot; Sakura said, forcing a smile.

The loud sound of someone clearing their throat was heard, and they 
turned to see a angry blue haired girl standing there. &quot;And of 
course,&quot; Juri said sardonically, &quot;his shadow, oops, I mean sister, 
Kozue.&quot; As soon as she saw her, Sakura knew she was the Card bearer. 
And something in Kozue&#39;s eyes let Sakura know she knew Sakura was a 
enemy.

Sakura could feel Kozue drawing power, when Sakura said, simply 
&quot;Later. Not here, not now.&quot; Kozue looked around a moment, then nodded.

Sakura made her excuses to Miki, and told him to get to a place he 
could be alone. She told him she would perform a ritual to help solve 
his problem. &#39;Which was true, as far as it goes,&#39; she thought with a 
smile. &quot;Juri, is there someplace private we can do this?&quot; she asked, 
and sweatdropped as Kozue gave her a death-glare.

&quot;There&#39;s a fencing hall free,&quot; Juri said, smiling a bit. She, Sakura, 
and Kozue walked in first, Tomoyo lagging behind them so she could 
videotape the group. As soon as they entered, Kozue walked over and 
picked up a sword, smiling evily.

Sakura offered her the chance to surrender, and Kozue flatly refused. 
&quot;Sakura, should I do the roses?&quot; Juri offered. Sakura nodded, and Juri 
put a blue rose in Kozue&#39;s pocket, whispering something in her ear 
that made her blush scarlet. A white rose went into Sakura&#39;s pocket, 
and Juri leaned close to whisper &quot;To the winner the spoils. She is 
kind of cute...&quot;

Sakura rolled her eyes, making Juri laugh. Pulling out the sword 
charm, Sakura said:

&quot;Oh Sword of Dios,

Power of magic, power of Right!

Surrender the Blade, the sword of Light!

Release!&quot;

The sword shining in her hands, she looked at Kozue. An odd, green 
mist swirled around her, but other than that, nothing seemed to be 
happening. Sakura charged Kozue, hoping to gain a surprise advantage, 
but as soon as she entered the mist, her skin felt like it was on 
fire! &quot;Oww! What the...whoops!&quot; Sakura yelled, barely dodging Kozue&#39;s 
first strike. The girl was relentless, pursuing the half blind, pain 
wracked girl until Sakura was finally able to get clear of the mists.

&quot;A nice trick,&quot; Sakura gasped out, &quot;but stink isn&#39;t going to win this 
one!&quot; Kozue gasped in rage, and Sakura grinned. A card appeared in her 
hand, and she cried &quot;Windy Card! Empower my blade! Windy!&quot; threw it in 
the air, and sliced across it with the Sword of Dios. Around her and 
the blade, a woman formed of air appeared, and with one sweep of the 
blade, the mist was gone.

Kozue gasped in shock as her precious mist disappeared, then cried out 
in horror as Sakura suddenly appeared in her face. &quot;Gotcha,&quot; she said 
quietly, and cut Kozue&#39;s rose to ribbons. The green mist swirled, 
condensing, then calmly approached and surrendered to Sakura&#39;s blade. 
&quot;Mist Card! Return to your power confined! Mist!&quot; The card formed, and 
gently dropped into Sakura&#39;s hand.

Kozue staggered, a look of pain and loss on her face, then she 
collapsed. Sakura quickly walked over, checking her pulse. &quot;She&#39;s 
fine,&quot; Sakura said softly. &quot;Let&#39;s get her back to her room.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re more generous than I would be,&quot; Juri said quietly.

Sakura knocked on Miki&#39;s door, and helped him carry Kozue inside. 
Tomoyo watched for a moment, then drew Juri aside. &quot;I wanted to ask 
something,&quot; Tomoyo said nervously.

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Juri asked in friendly tones.

&quot;Are you in love with Sakura?&quot; Tomoyo asked boldly. Juri looked at her 
blankly, then began to, quite uncharacteristically, giggle quietly.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the chuckling Juri said, &quot;I&#39;m not laughing at you.&quot; She 
wipes teary eyes, smiling. &quot;After what happened with Shiori, I&#39;ve 
sworn off younger women.&quot; she explained. &quot;Besides, I have a 
girlfriend.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Tomoyo echoed, smiling as well. &quot;I... like her,&quot; Tomoyo 
admitted, &quot;even if she doesn&#39;t know it.&quot; She looked thoughtful. &quot;So 
you have an older lover?&quot;

Juri grinned saucily. &quot;Experience is the best teacher,&quot; she quipped. 
&quot;Lets go grab Sakura, go get some food and celebrate her victory, OK?&quot; 
Juri asked, smiling.

Sensing a change in topic, Tomoyo let it go. </pre>
