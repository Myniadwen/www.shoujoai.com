<a href="../crossover/sillyass-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Excel knocked on the nurse&#39;s office door softly, and impatiently 
shifted back and forth as she waited.

Wakaba popped open the door, looking very frighteningly genki, &quot;Good 
morning!&quot; The nurse&#39;s uniform she was wearing had been modified 
somewhat, very tight and clingly, with a very exposed clevage.

Excel sweatdropped a bit. &quot;Were you wearing that outfit the last time 
we were here?&quot; she asked as she carried her burden inside, putting her 
down on the bed gently.

&quot;This is the new uniform approved by Akio-sama himself,&quot; Wakaba 
explained to them cheerfully. &quot;Hyatt, again?&quot; she asked, looking down 
at the dark hared girl on the bed. Hyatt&#39;s face was an odd blue color, 
matching her costume nicely.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Excel said sadly, &quot;and we were just about to have some HLS, 
too.&quot;

&quot;HLS?&quot; Wakaba echoed questioningly.

&quot;Hot Lesbian Sex,&quot; Excel elaborated mournfully.

Wakaba sweatdropped a bit, and decided she wasn&#39;t going to ask 
anything else.



The silver armored figure leapt, blades extended, and was met in the 
air by a leather clad figure bearing a katana. Blades clashed, and 
they both returned to the earth. The woman slid a high tech pair of 
sunglasses up, revealing violet eyes.

&quot;Nicely done,&quot; Angela said with a little smile, &quot;you are a worthy 
opponent.&quot; The android slid her blade home with a steely snap.

Sylia Stingray slid her visor up, her silver hair framinng her 
expressive face. &quot;Not bad at all,&quot; she said admiringly. &quot;Want to try 
again?&quot;

Angela grinned ferally, &quot;Why not.&quot;

&quot;How long do you think they&#39;ll keep this up?&quot; Haruka asked Linna 
quietly.

&quot;Who knows,&quot; Linna said with a sigh. She looked over at the girl 
thoughtfully, she was kind of cute, with long brown hair and a gentle 
voice. A bit odd, but nice. Lina asked her &quot;How are you adapting to 
being around human beings, again?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m more used to robots,&quot; Haruka admitted a bit shyly. She looked 
over at Angela, and a faint blush appeared on her cheeks.

Linna&#39;s eyes widened, and a little smile appeared on her face. &quot;Maybe 
Angela will get some ideas hanging around human beings,&quot; she suggested 
softly.

Haruka blushed neon. &quot;I.. how...&quot; she stuttered.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Lina said gently, putting her hand on Haruka&#39;s arm. 
&quot;You may have noticed that two girl&#39;s together are pretty common 
around here.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not quite the problem,&quot; Haruka said, still blushing fiercely, 
&quot;in this case it&#39;s girl and robot.&quot; She was a bit surprised at Linna&#39;s 
soft chuckle.

Linna discretely pointed to where Nene and Mackie were laying in the 
grass together. &quot;Girl and robot,&quot; she said with a little smile.

Haruka looked at the two of them with an odd expression on her face. 
&quot;I didn&#39;t realize,&quot; she said thoughtfully.

Even as Angela fought Sylia, she kept an eye on Haruka. The girl had 
been surrounded by robots all her life, and she wanted to make sure 
she was all right.

It had been strange, stepping out of their transport and discovering 
they were surrounded by humans. Spike and the others were overjoyed, 
but Haruka had almost been afraid, clinging to Angela&#39;s side. A faint 
blush appeared on her cheeks, remembering how pleasant it had been 
holding Haruka safe with her arm across her shoulders.

Haruka stood up to wave at her, so with a single leap she disengaged 
from Sylia. &quot;Maybe another time,&quot; Angela nodded to Sylia, then she 
walked to Haruka&#39;s side.

Linna watched the two walk away, the robot hovering protectively over 
the girl &quot;Do you think they&#39;re a couple?&quot;

Sylia shrugged, &quot;It&#39;s certainly possible.&quot; She looked over at Linna 
thoughtfully, &quot;Why, were you interested in the girl, too?&quot;

Linna blushed under Sylia&#39;s teasing tone, &quot;Sorry, she&#39;s way too young 
for me. Besides, I&#39;m happily coupled, thank you.&quot;

Sylia laughed, &quot;You and Priss have fun tonight.&quot; She stripped off her 
hardsuit quite casually, before stretching out in her skin tight 
leotard, her long silvery hair flowing down her back. &quot;Just keep the 
noise down,&quot; she added over her shoulder.

A blushing Linna decided not to comment on that.



Haruka and Angela stood in the doorway, looking around them in awe. 
The halls were almost completely filled with people of all shapes and 
sizes, and most of them dressed quite outrageously. Skin tight body 
suits, cute little sailor fukus, boys and girl&#39;s school uniforms and 
many other types of clothing were in evidence.

&quot;I guess we start looking for an empty room,&quot; Angela said softly.

Haruka nodded a bit nervously, quietly asking &quot;Could we share one?&quot;

Angela smiled down at her, sounding a bit relieved herself as she 
said, &quot;Of course.&quot;

A room along the outside wall was soon selected, and they both settled 
in for the night. Spike and the other two robots had chosen to stay 
outside with their vehicle, but Angela was determined to watch over 
Haruka.

The single bed was too small for them both, so Angela took a guard 
position at the end of the bed, facing the door. Haruka changed into 
her night clothes and crawled beneath the covers, turning out the 
bedside lamp.

All was silent for a moment, then Angela heard Haruka quietly ask her, 
&quot;Can robots fall in love?&quot;

Angela&#39;s eyes widened beneath her visor. &quot;Yes, I think so,&quot; she said 
quietly, &quot;a fellow gladiator robot I knew, she fell in love with and 
fought for a young girl.&quot;

&quot;Did that bother you?&quot; was asked hesitantly from the darkness.

&quot;I didn&#39;t understand it at first,&quot; Angela admitted softly, &quot;but now I 
think I can understand her better.&quot;

&quot;Why is that?&quot; her voice asked Angela quietly.

&quot;Because I find myself loving and fighting for someone as well, 
Haruka,&quot; Angela said after a moment of silence. &quot;I fight for you,&quot; she 
started, but she couldn&#39;t finish what she wanted to say. The words 
just didn&#39;t seem to want to come out.

Gentle fingers pushed up her visor, and Angela found herself looking 
into Haruka&#39;s eyes, glittering with tears. &quot;I love you, Angela,&quot; 
Haruka said softly.

A small smile gently stretched Angela&#39;s lips, &quot;I love you, too.&quot; She 
reached out, and gently pulled her into a kiss.
