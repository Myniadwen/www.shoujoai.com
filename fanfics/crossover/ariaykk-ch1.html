<pre>The Second Age of Man

By the mid twenty-first century, the Earth&#39;s population had hit a low 
point, caused in part due to climate change and other natural disasters. 
For a time, people believed that this might represent the winding down 
of the human species, but remarkably the population began to bounce 
back. Slowly then with increasing vigor humanity began to repopulate the 
world, their cultures shifting and evolving as they did do. The return 
of the experimental craft the Taapon provided a technological boost for 
the survivors, and helped guide humanity&#39;s development in the years to 
come.

The terraforming of Mars had first begun before the disaster hit Earth, 
and continued on as the future colonists realized they might not have a 
home to return to. As a side effect of being cut off from Earth&#39;s 
resources the scientists miscalculated the amount of water they released 
from the ice caps of mars, flooding the world and eventually resulting 
in it being renamed Aqua. As humanity recovered on Earth and ventured 
back out into space they made contact with Aqua, and by 2301 there was 
regular commercial and tourist travel between them.

Because of the catastrophe Earth&#39;s population never recovered to 
twentieth century levels, and their society had developed along more 
technologically advanced lines. Robots and machinery began to take over 
previously manpower intensive tasks such as farming, construction, etc, 
etc, freeing humans to pursue their personal development. However there 
has been some backlash against this technology dependant culture which 
has spurred immigration to the more primitive world of Aqua.

An extract from the Encyclopedia Wikipediax, 2325 edition.

The breeze gently swirled the surface of the water in the canal, sending 
tiny ripples across the blue surface in a delicate pattern. As the 
ripples traveled the gondola smoothly slid across the water, a steady 
hand guiding it gently forward as the sun&#39;s rays kissed warm skin.

Akagi Mizunashi gracefully guided the gondola, her light pink flowing 
over her shoulders in two streams. She wore the single glove of a 
journeyman undine, her smile warm as they enjoyed the scenery around 
them. Early this morning she had woken up at Aria company, planning on 
practicing today, but when Miss Alicia went out and a pair of customers 
arrived needing a Undine, Akagi volunteered immediately.

The two ladies were from the nation of Japan on Manhome, and both seemed 
a bit unusual compared to other clients Alpha had served. It wasn&#39;t the 
hair colors or their beauty, tho both were unique, but instead a odd air 
of serenity both woman had, as if they had experienced a great deal and 
could handle whatever came up Now sitting on the gondola and taking in 
the sights the two young looking women were clearly enjoying themselves, 
one taking many photographs with a expensive looking camera while the 
other sat close, gently holding on to her hand.

&quot;Miss Hatsuseno,&quot; Akagi said as she shifted the paddle to carefully 
control the rocking of the boat, &quot;I hope you&#39;re getting the shots you 
want.&quot;

Alpha Hatsuseno smiled as she put the camera down in her lap, her green 
hair falling into her eyes as she said, &quot;This city is beautiful!&quot; She 
chuckled softly and chided Akagi, &quot;And please, call me Alpha.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Akagi conceded, &quot;Miss Alpha.&quot;

The light purple haired young woman chuckled softly, &quot;Alpha won&#39;t let 
you get away with miss, either.&quot; She offered her hand, &quot;My name is 
Kokone Hatsuseno.&quot;

Akagi carefully gripped her oar with one hand as she shook Kokone&#39;s 
hand. Noting the similarity in their looks she politely asked, &quot;Are you 
two sisters, Miss Kokone?&quot;

&quot;Ah, no,&quot; Kokone looked a bit sheepish.

Alpha reached out to take Kokone&#39;s hand as she explained, &quot;Actually, 
this is a sort of belated honeymoon for us.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Akagi blinked, then her eyes widened as she smiled, &quot;Oh! 
Congratulations.&quot;

Kokone blushed, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;This is the first time we&#39;ve left Earth,&quot; Alpha admitted, &quot;do you have 
any suggestions?&quot;

Akagi smiled, the Aria company uniform fluttering around her legs as she 
guided them through a turn, &quot;Oh, I think I know a few places.&quot;

Guiding them through the city&#39;s canals Akagi took them to a old 
fashioned baked potato stand, the scent of the sweet potatoes lingering 
in the air. Ordering she was careful not to get any butter or toppings 
for Alpha&#39;s then they returned to the boat to eat, savoring their food 
with a thermos of tea she had packed for the occasion.

&quot;You can&#39;t eat them with butter?&quot; Akagi asked sympathetically.

Alpha nodded, her expression more amused than anything. &quot;My body just 
can&#39;t tolerate animal proteins,&quot; she explained, &quot;but I have no idea 
why.&quot;

&quot;Hmmm,&quot; Kokone exclaimed happily as she ate her food, &quot;they don&#39;t make 
food like this on Earth anymore.&quot;

&quot;Or go out to a roadside stand and get it,&quot; Alpha noted thoughtfully as 
she munched, &quot;it&#39;s all home delivered now.&quot;

Kokone paused in her eating as she looked up at Alpha, &quot;Are you thinking 
of...?&quot;

Alpha just winked at Kokone as she looked over at Akagi, &quot;So, where to 
next?&quot;

With that Akagi took them on a tour of the city, smoothly pointing out 
the sights like the Bridge of Sighs, through the bustling marketplace 
then out along the channels to the sea. There they coasted along 
peacefully for a bit, her passengers seeming as content as Akagi to 
drift along, enjoying the sun, waves and the breeze playing over their 
skin.

&quot;Akagi,&quot; Alpha finally broke the comfortable silence, &quot;how hard is it to 
learn to sail a gondola?&quot; Not to be a undine,&quot; she quickly added, &quot;just 
to get around.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s really not too hard to learn,&quot; Akagi admitted, &quot;as long as you can 
swim.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I think I can manage,&quot; Alpha smiled mysteriously as she and Kokone 
exchanged a amused look.

&quot;She&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Kokone agreed with a chuckle.

Alpha looked back at the city, bustling and full of life as she quietly 
asked, &quot;Kokone, what do you think?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s different, but it reminds me of Yokohama back then, with the 
people and all the things to do,&quot; Kokone answered promptly.

&quot;And the sort of place a delivery woman might find work?&quot; Alpha asked 
her with a sly little smile.

Kokone chuckled softly as she answered, &quot;Or where a caf&#130; that&#39;s a little 
off the beaten track might do well.&quot;

&quot;Wha?&quot; Akari blinked, looking confused.

Akari didn&#39;t find out what they were talking about until nearly a month 
later. She and Alicia were cleaning up at Aria Company&#39;s headquarters 
when the massive cat President Aria made a excited sound at the arrival 
of the mail boat.

&quot;Oh, there&#39;s a new mail person,&quot; Alicia noted, the tall woman looking 
out the window as Akari headed to the door.

&quot;Hello Akari,&quot; Kokone smiled, standing cautiously in the boat as she 
handed them their packages, &quot;nice to see you again.&quot;

&quot;You decided to stay?&quot; Akari realized as she took their mail.

&quot;Alpha and I,&quot; Kokone agreed, &quot;in fact, your invitation should be in 
this mail delivery.&quot;

&quot;Invitation?&quot; Alicia wondered as she flipped through the mail till she 
found the small envelope. Opening it she read aloud., &quot;The employees of 
Aria Company are invited to attend the grand opening of Caf&#130; Alpha 
II...&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll be looking forward to seeing you,&quot; Kokone said as she headed down 
to the boat then off to her next stop.

&quot;You know,&quot; Alicia mused after a moment&#39;s thought, &quot;from what you&#39;ve 
said Akari I think they&#39;ll fit in here just fine.&quot;

End

Notes: The disaster leading to the world in Yokohama Kaidashi Kiko 
occurs a unknown time in the future, so it wasn&#39;t too hard to fit it 
into Aria&#39;s past.
