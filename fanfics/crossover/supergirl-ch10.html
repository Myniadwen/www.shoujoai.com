<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 10 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/supergirl-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre> B-ko actually felt a burst of relief as she strode into the familiar 
classroom and took her usual seat. She had a lot to think about, not the 
least of which being her meeting her mother, and the class time would 
give her the perfect opportunity.

&#39;I wonder if she will actually try to contact me?&#39; B-ko thought. The 
woman had seemed to be honest, but that didn&#39;t necessarily mean much. 
Her father always seemed to be sincere, but he was one of the most 
practiced liars that she had ever met. &#39;Wonder if that&#39;s how she fell 
for him?&#39; B-ko thought to herself ruefully.

Laurel Kent looked over at her worriedly from the seat right beside B- 
ko, and she gave A-ko a reassuring little smile. The dark haired girl 
didn&#39;t look too comforted, and B-ko sighed to herself softly.
A-ko had seemed to sense there was something going on with her almost as 
soon as they all returned to the Watchtower. But with a surprising show 
of tactfulness she had given B-ko her space, letting her work through 
whatever was wrong herself. And then there was Kestrel.

Helena Wayne had taken her aside for a few moments, just before she left 
to return to her own duties in Gotham City. &quot;Lena Luthor&#39;s your mother, 
isn&#39;t she?&quot; Kestrel asked her point blank.

&quot;Yes,&quot; B-ko had answered her simply.

&quot;I don&#39;t really care who you mother is,&quot; and Kestrel smiled at her 
wryly, &quot;I&#39;m not too proud of my mom, either. But just don&#39;t let it 
effect your work up here.&quot;

&quot;It won&#39;t,&quot; B-ko said firmly.

&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Kestrel said softly. &quot;Would you mind walking me to the 
teleporters?&quot; she took B-ko&#39;s arm, gently tugging her along. B-ko kept 
her mouth shut as they walked, looking at the woman walking beside her. 
Quietly, Kestrel said, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind showing you around Gotham some 
time. It&#39;s got it&#39;s charm, as crazy as it gets at times.&quot;

&#39;Is she actually asking me out?&#39; B-ko thought wildly. &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; 
she answered.

Kestrel gave her a relived smile, pushing back her cowl. Helena met her 
eyes, her dark hair falling messily, &quot;I&#39;ll look forward to it.&quot; A gentle 
kiss was placed on B-ko&#39;s cheek, then she ducked into the teleporter and 
was gone.

A slightly dazed B-ko had stumbled back down the hallway into the vast 
monitor room, and A-ko gave her a gentle smile. A smile that had quickly 
turned into a chuckle as she said, &quot;There&#39;s something on your cheek.&quot;

B-ko wiped quickly, looking down at her fingers in confusion. Lipstick. 
She went red.

A-ko smiled, but didn&#39;t say anything. &quot;I&#39;m heading down to get some 
sleep,&quot; A-ko said, &quot;I&#39;ll see you in class tomorrow?&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; B-ko managed, &quot;you go down first, I&#39;ve got to finish repairing 
D-ko.&quot;
The teacher cleared her throat before calling out her name, and B-ko 
picked up her notebook before standing up. Having been half listening to 
the class drone on, she quickly found the correct passage in her book 
and began to read. The woman looked surprised, obviously having hoped to 
catch her asleep in class. She smoothly finished her reading and then 
sat back down, letting her thoughts carry her away once again.
Not long after Kestrel had left, D-ko sat uncomfortably on the work 
bench as B-ko labored on her shoulder assembly. Some of the servos and 
inner wiring had been damaged by a battledroid&#39;s punch, leaving the arm 
hanging limp and inoperative. &quot;I&#39;m going to have to improve your 
internal armor,&quot; B-ko calmly noted, her hands buried in wiring.

&quot;Why?&quot; D-ko asked curiously, &quot;The damage wasn&#39;t that severe.&quot;

&quot;You intend to go out and play hero with us again?&quot; B-ko asked her 
quietly, using a torch to seal the connections together.

&quot;I&#39;d like to,&quot; D-ko admitted, &quot;if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;You surprised me at first,&quot; B-ko admitted, &quot;but we&#39;re glad to have 
you.&quot; She tugged at a connection, making sure it was firmly attached, &quot;I 
didn&#39;t really build you for extended combat. So, I&#39;ll upgrade you and 
add the armor in as a bonus.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; D-ko gave her a sunny smile.

B-ko snapped the panels on D-ko&#39;s back closed, &quot;Give it a try.&quot;

The arm moved easily, and D-ko bowed, &quot;Thank you very much!&quot; A moment, 
&quot;Could I go put my skin back on?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m done for tonight,&quot; B-ko smiled.

D-ko walked over to a device sitting in a corner of B-ko&#39;s new workshop 
and the golden skinned robot stepped into a large, human shaped opening. 
Panels slid closed around her, there was a hiss of rapidly sprayed 
liquid, a puff of steam, and then a much more human looking D-ko 
emerged. She pulled her maid&#39;s uniform back on, then turned to bow to 
B-ko once again before leaving to her duties around the Watchtower.

&quot;I wanted to talk to you alone,&quot; B-ko was startled by a quiet voice 
coming from right behind her. B-ko whirled around to find the Oracle 
hologram standing there, watching her with a certain amount of 
amusement.

Puffing out a breath B-ko asked, &quot;Is there something I can do for you?&quot;

Looking clearly nervous Oracle answered her, &quot;Yes, there is.&quot; A pause, 
&quot;B-ko, can you build me an android body?&quot;

B-ko blinked at her in surprise, &quot;An android body?&quot; She shook her head, 
&quot;Why do you want one? I thought you were happy as Oracle.&quot;

&quot;I am! Or at least most of the time I am,&quot; Oracle answered her quietly, 
&quot;but...&quot; She sighed softly, or at least the hologram acted like she was 
sighing, &quot;I miss being able to touch physical things, miss being 
touched. I can go anywhere there is on the world internet, but I can&#39;t 
do something as simple as take a walk in a park.&quot;

B-ko nodded thoughtfully. &quot;All right, I&#39;ll do it,&quot; she resolved. She 
looked up at Oracle curiously, &quot;What sort of body do you want?&quot;

Oracle obviously hadn&#39;t been expecting that particular question as she 
blinked in confusion and said, &quot;I&#39;m not sure what you mean.&quot;

B-ko ticked the points off on her fingers, &quot;Do you want just a replica 
of your old body? A completely new body design? Or even a superhuman 
form?&quot;

&quot;To be honest,&quot; Oracle admitted, &quot;I hadn&#39;t thought quite that far.&quot;

B-ko nodded, &quot;I guess that&#39;s understandable.&quot; She looked over at Oracle 
thoughtfully, &quot;I can build the android&#39;s framework and internal systems 
first. That&#39;ll take a week or so, and give you some time to think about 
it.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Oracle smiled down at her gratefully. She paused, and a little 
smile appeared on her face, &quot;So how are you and Helena getting along?&quot; 
She laughed at the look on B-ko&#39;s face and disappeared from the room.
&#39;All in all,&#39; a smiling B-ko thought as the class was let out for their 
lunch, &#39;it&#39;s been an interesting few days.&#39; She made her way to Laurel, 
&quot;Care to eat together?&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Laurel smiled. The dark haired girl looked and even acted so 
very different from A-ko, even B-ko occasionally forgot that she was 
actually A-ko.

B-ko opened her bento and delicately used her chopsticks to eat. She 
looked up to see Laurel shoveling food into her mouth quickly, and 
sighed. &quot;How&#39;s your lunch?&quot; B-ko asked wryly.

&quot;Pretty good,&quot; Laurel grinned. She looked down at her meal thoughtfully, 
&quot;You want to know something weird? I even miss those poisonous lunches 
C-ko used to make.&quot;

B-ko froze, her chopsticks halfway to her mouth. &quot;C-ko,&quot; she murmured 
softly.

&quot;What?&quot; Laurel asked her softly.

&quot;It just occurred to me,&quot; a pale B-ko said softly, &quot;I haven&#39;t even 
thought of C-ko in days. And Helena...&quot; she trailed off.

&quot;C-ko&#39;s my friend,&quot; Laurel said softly, &quot;and she told me enough times 
that it&#39;s even gotten through my thick head that she&#39;s your friend too.&quot; 
A wry smile, &quot;I don&#39;t think she&#39;d mind, B-ko.&quot;

B-ko smiled slightly, &quot;Thanks.&quot;</pre>
