<h1>Megatokyo Burning (part 12 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/megaburn-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>The Locket was closed, probably the first time in
years that had happened during one of the business&#39;
usual nights. Inside womer rushed about and even a few
men helped out with the preperations. &quot;You know,&quot;
Mamoru murmured, dressed in his black tuxedo, &quot;I
always wanted to see the interior of this place, but I
wish it hadn&#39;t been like this.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Touga Kiryuu acknowledged, his long red
hair flowing down his back.

Sylia Stingray put her cellphone away as she turned to
the crowd, white hair flowing. &quot;Nene and the AD Police
are moving out,&quot; she reported, &quot;she&#39;d like us out on
the streets as soon as possible, in case this blows up
spectacularly.&quot;

&quot;Dibs on visiting Bioware,&quot; Minagi spoke up, her
slightly spiked blue hair swept back from her face.
The tall warrior wore a simple, tight body suit and
her expression was grave.

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Arisugawa Juri agreed, her own eyes
glittering angrily. The orange haired woman was
dressed in a variation of her old Duelist uniform, the
white and orange bodysuit made of the finest
armor-cloth.

&quot;Bad idea,&quot; Minako Aino said firmly, meeting the
glares of several of the Locket staff calmly.

&quot;Keiko was our friend,&quot; Mahoro said coldly, the black
haired maid cleaning the fearsome looking pistol that
was her favorite weapon, &quot;how can we not be involved?&quot;

Natsuna Sakurada smiled grimly, her long brown hair
touched by more tha a bit of gray. &quot;Bringing these
bastards to justice will hurt them far more than a
moment of vengeance,&quot; the former police officer
reminded them.

&quot;I have all the justice they&#39;ll need,&quot; Excel said
firmly, hefting a surprisingly large machete. Beside
the little blonde Hyatt looked oddly dangerous, her
own sword ready.

Surprisingly Nabiki Tendo spoke up, &quot;I won&#39;t be going
out with you, but I think they have a point.&quot; The
black haired older woman smiled grimly, &quot;I don&#39;t think
that Keiko would have wanted you to do that, anyway.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll let the AD Police have the first shot at
Bioware,&quot; Juri finally cut off the growing argument,
&quot;but if they fail all bets are off.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Usagi Tsukino said. Around her the
other Sailor Senshi had gathered as she continued,
&quot;You take Nergal&#39;s headquarters while we take Bioware,
and I promise to let you know if there&#39;s any
problems.&quot;

Setsuna put her hand on Juri;s arm then kissed her
gently. &quot;Be careful love,&quot; she murmured, mane of
greenish black hair flowing gracefully, &quot;I&#39;ll be
back,&quot;

&quot;You too,&quot; Juri said softly as the group left. She
looked about the bar, and in moments Minagi, Mahoro,
Excel and surprisingly Cyber Six joined her. &quot;Sasami,&quot;
she adressed the princess of Jurai, &quot;I hate to ask but
can you keep an eye on the place?&quot;

Sasami frowned, the little girl&#39;s twin streams of blue
hair bobbing angrily. &quot;I could always become Tsunami,&quot;
she offered, refering to her adult other-self.

&quot;Part of why we&#39;d want you here,&quot; Minagi smiled at her
lover, &quot;if the enemy does strike at the Locket you can
defend the place.&quot;

&quot;I could use the help,&quot; Nabiki said, smiling at Sasami
entreatingly.

&quot;All right,&quot; Sasami agreed with a sigh. She looked up
at Minagi fiercely and warned, &quot;Don&#39;t you dare do
anything foolish.&quot;

&quot;Would I do that?&quot; Minagi smirked.

&quot;I&#39;ll keep an eye on her,&quot; Mahoro quickly reassured
Sasami. Ignoring their protests Excel and Hyatt were
also assigned to protect the building and the group
was nearly ready to go.

Sylia and her people left first, then Usagi and the
other Senshi, Utena and the Duelists and finally Juri
and her allies headed out to try to help. &quot;Minagi, you
mind?&quot; Juri asked with a smile.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Minagi slipped her hands under Juri&#39;s arms and
took to the air even as Cyber Six and Mahoro bounded
along beside her.

&quot;I was a little surprised to see you volunteer,&quot;
Mahoro commented, her maid&#39;s uniform, swirling around
her as she hit a rooftop then bounded on.

The leather clad Cyber Six hit a rooftop, her long
cape flowing in the breeze. &quot;Keiko&#39;s been kind to me,&quot;
she answered, dark eyes peering under her hat, &quot;as has
May.&quot;

The sounds of sirens waited in the distance, and they
could see AD Police copters spreading out to head for
the several business complexes. On the ground the
heavy transports raced along oddly empty streets, each
loaded with K-suits and troopers bound for battle.

&quot;Do you think they&#39;re going to be trouble?&quot; Minagi
asked.

Sudden the sound of a explosion went off, not far from
AD Police headquarters. &quot;Does that answer your
question?&quot; Juri asked grimly. They swooped down
towards the Nergal headquarters as she added, &quot;Don&#39;t
attack first, we don&#39;t want to be the ones starting
the fight.&quot;

The flash of weapon&#39;s discharges grew brighter as they
hit the ground, racing forward together through the
twilight of morning. &quot;Somehow I don&#39;t think that will
be a problem,&quot; Mahoro noted as they saw mercenary
armored suits engaging a badly outnumbered force of AD
Police K-suits.

The armored suits were clearly military grade,
carrying some faily impressive arms. Along with a
heavy rifle mini-missile launchers were on each
shoulder, the armor providing some truly impressive
strength magnification as well. The police K-suits, on
the other hand, had less powerful rifles and strength
boost only, putting them at some disadvantage.

&quot;Remember that there&#39;s human beings in these things,&quot;
Cyber Six said grimly, &quot;disarm then, but don&#39;t kill.&quot;

Juri activated her sword, a gift she had recieved many
years ago from Minagi, Ryouko and a few other
connected to Jurai and smiled, the energy blade
lighting up her face. &quot;Mahoro, take the high ground
and open fire,&quot; she instructed, &quot;the rest of us will
back up the K-suits.&quot;

Minagi lit up her own energy blade, racing foward
faster than the others to tear into a truly stunned
mercenary. The blade cut through layers of armor like
paper, then she used brute strenngth to tear the
segments apart. An AD Police officer gaped at her from
where he stood nearby and Minagi grinned, &quot;Do I get a
thank you?&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; he stammered.

From her perch on a Police transport Mahoro fired with
unearthly precision, targeting joints in the bulky
enemy suits. The petite woman&#39;s gun had been built to
help hunt aliens, way bck when, and up against battle
armor it was almost too effective.

Juri throttled back her anger, careful to use the
shining blade to only cut dep enough to disable the
armors, not to harm the pilots. &#39;At least not too
much,&#39; she thought, slicking across a fighter&#39;s chest
plate and severing primary connections there.

Ducking beneath a blow Cyber Six kicked gracefully,
sensing her foe stumbling backwards. All around them
the AD Police were rallying, getting the advantage now
that the mercenaries were so badly off balance. She
reached out, grasped hold of the seam betwee the helm
and the suit and with a single effort ripped the
helmet clean off.

&quot;What the hell are you!&quot; the young man squeaked, his
face bone pale.

Cyber Six wasn&#39;t in the mood to joke, just meeting his
eyes coldly. &quot;Someone who doesn&#39;t like armed criminals
in her city,&quot; and then she punched him out.

Vaulting over a suit Juri severed the backpack
connectionns, cutting off the power toothe bulky armor
then smoothly kicking it over. &quot;That hurt,&quot; she
grimaced. Looking around Juri waved over an AD police
lieutenant, &quot;How are the other arrests going?&quot;

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t...&quot; the brown haired young man looked at
her hesitantly, his name tag identifying him as
Yukari.

&quot;We just saved your hides,&quot; Minagi dropped down from
where she had been hovering in midair shaking a merc
free of his suit, &quot;and you may need more of our help
before this is through.&quot;

Yukari nodded reluctantly, &quot;Point.&quot; With that he
touched his earpiece, speaking softly into his mike
before he seemed to freeze.

&quot;Want to bet it&#39;s bad news?&quot; Cyber Six asked.

Mahoro walked up, reloading bullets into her pistol as
she said, &quot;That&#39;d be a foolish bet.&quot;

With the sounds of violence off in the distance as a
backdrop Yukari said grimly, &quot;The arrests are on hold,
Mercenary forces are attacking all over the city. The
AD Police are being stretched to the limit just trying
to cope.&quot;

Juri met the others eyes, seeing agreement in them
all. Lighting up her blade again she said, &quot;Then it
looks like we&#39;ll have to get to work.&quot;</pre>
