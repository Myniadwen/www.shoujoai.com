&quot;Her solace, her refuge...&quot;

	&quot;Konban wa Rei-san!&quot;  Makoto&#39;s cheery voice broke the terse and 
tense silence that had wafted across the room after the raven haired 
teen&#39;s less than elegant greeting.  Utena&#39;s eyes went wide with shock 
and she wondered if the rogue had gone mad.  Minako, on the other hand, 
picked up quickly where Makoto left off.

	&quot;You&#39;re back!&quot; Her voice, though strangely stiff, was just as 
cheery as ever, and the pink haired girl could tell she was trying to 
remain as relaxed and laid back as possible.  &quot;We&#39;ve already started in 
on cake and ice cream, Rei-chan, why don&#39;t you and I go get you some?!&quot;  
Minako was about to rise to her feet when the look on the raven haired 
teen&#39;s face stopped her.

	The miko&#39;s nostrils flared threateningly, her chest huffing as she 
threw daggers at the tomboy with her eyes.  Makoto smirked, winking at 
the girl as she slid her arm behind Ami&#39;s head, letting it rest on the 
top of the couch.  The basketball player was looking between the two 
rivals and saw the chestnut haired girl&#39;s movement, Is she baiting her? 
She wondered with slight agitation.  This would not bode well.

	Before Rei could blow her top again, though, a charming and deep 
voice spoke from behind her, accompanied by two long arms encircling 
her, &quot;Rei!  Cake and ice cream!&quot;  Haruka picked the sexy girl up and 
twirled her around, singing off key, &quot;Cake and ice cream, lets eat cake 
and ice cream!&quot;  She drawled out each word, emphasizing the words &#39;cake&#39; 
and &#39;ice cream&#39; through high pitches.

	&quot;ARGH! PUT ME DOWN HARUKA!&quot;  The lavender eyed girl began to kick 
at the blonde&#39;s grasp, though it did her no good as the racer carried 
her down the hall past several wide-eyed girls.  From down the hall, 
they could hear Rei continue to scream and oddly, giggle, from what they 
assumed, was Haruka&#39;s torturous tickling.

	The blue haired girl sighed, her shoulders drooped a little, 
obviously relieved as she leaned back into the couch.  She was rather 
glad that the blonde tomboy came at the moment she did and thanked 
Kami-sama a thousand times over in her head.  Her eyes had not left Rei 
the entire time, fearing what the girl would do to Makoto, and so she 
inadvertently missed the rogue&#39;s near fatal mistake.  Utena, on the 
other hand, was scowling at no one in particular, but rather at the 
chestnut haired teen&#39;s obvious intent to arouse the miko&#39;s anger.

	She knew that Makoto would defend herself, going for the jugular 
if necessary, but she&#39;d never actually seen her start a fight.  The 
basketball player hoped that the rogue would at least be the bigger 
person when Rei came back inside.  It was inevitable-after all-that the 
two would have a showdown; especially since the tall girl all but 
invited herself to the party.

	Several girls reentered the room wearing slightly perplexed looks 
on their faces and murmuring about how cute Haruka and Rei looked 
together.  One of them nudged Minako and quietly asked if Rei was 
screaming about Makoto being here.  Minako nodded, still recovering from 
her near fatal heart attack at having the two intense and huge 
personalities in the same room at the same time.  The blonde was hoping 
the raven haired girl would be a little longer outside giving her time 
to marshal the troupes behind the tomboy so Rei would have no choice but 
to grudgingly allow her at the party.

	&quot;Ami, can we step outside a moment?&quot;  The roguish tomboy no more 
than finished her question when the blue haired girl practically jumped 
out of her seat, already heading for the door.  Makoto raised a chestnut 
eyebrow, but said nothing as she placed her half-empty plate on the end 
table, rising to follow the genius.

	Minako found her voice as she watched the two walking out of the 
room, &quot;Wait, Mako-chan, that&#39;s not a good idea...&quot;

	Twinkling emerald eyes found the blonde girl on the floor, &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry, I&#39;ll have her back in one piece.&quot;  She nodded before leaving the 
room.

	Utena sighed and set her bowl down in her lap, reaching up to rub 
her forehead, &quot;Rei&#39;s going to flip,&quot; she mumbled just softly enough for 
her girlfriend to hear.

	The volleyball player frowned, agreeing silently.

	&quot;Neh, are Makoto-san and Ami-chan an item?&quot;

	Minako turned to the other redheaded guest and scrunched her 
eyebrows together as she replied, &quot;I... Well, if they are, I haven&#39;t 
heard anything.  But don&#39;t they make a cute couple?&quot;  The blonde was 
grinning again now, happy to have a slight subject change away from 
anything about Makoto and Rei.

	Unazuki dipped her head, blushing lightly, &quot;I... I guess.  It&#39;s 
just that, well, do you think Makoto-san really likes Ami-chan?&quot;

	Dazzling blue eyes blinked several times, watching the older girl 
curiously, &quot;Um, I&#39;m...&quot; She paused a moment, feeling her girlfriend&#39;s 
stormy eyes on the back of her head.  Realizing that a spot so near the 
pink haired girl probably wasn&#39;t a good idea for what was about to be 
said, the volleyball player moved away and more towards the green eyed 
girl.  &quot;If you&#39;re asking me, I think Mako-chan is totally into our 
little genius.  And to top that off, I think our little genius 
reciprocates those feelings.&quot;

	&quot;Minako...&quot;  Utena started.

	But the volleyball player just ignored her, scooting closer to her 
sempai as she continued, &quot;But really, those two, they&#39;re so private and 
withdrawn from everyone else, it worries me sometimes...&quot;  Tapping her 
finger on her front teeth, Minako looked up at the entrance to the 
living room, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be easier on both of them if they were to just 
be open, instead of being all secretive?&quot;

	She had mumbled the last part mostly to herself and continued to 
stare in the same direction, obviously lost in thought.  From behind, 
Utena watched Minako with a frown; she hadn&#39;t heard what the voluptuous 
teen mumbled, but she assumed the girl was simply worried about her 
friend.  The basketball player could relate in this regard; Makoto had 
shown yet another side of her personality tonight and it had upset her 
slightly.

----------------------------

	&quot;God damnit, Haruka, put me the hell down!&quot;  She gasped when the 
tall teen began to tickle her with long nimble fingers, her once 
screaming erupting into angry giggles between words. &quot;I ... MEAN... IT!&quot;

	&quot;Aw, and here I thought no girl could resist my charm and good 
looks.&quot;  The racer chuckled, stopping the tickling but continuing her 
hold on the hot tempered Miko as she walked into the kitchen.  Lavender 
eyes shot towards the meatball head blonde inhaling her cake like a 
vacuum and drooling tempestuously over what was left of the rest of the 
cake.

	&quot;LEAVE SOME CAKE FOR THE REST OF US ODANGO!&quot;  Rei screamed 
defiantly, despite her current position.

	Haruka chuckled at the raven haired girl, one track mind.  Usagi 
jumped back away from the cake she&#39;d been eyeing and slowly inching 
towards with her fork when Naru wasn&#39;t looking.

      The redhead heaved a sigh, shoving her own piece of cake in front 
of the blonde girl, &quot;C&#39;mon Usa-chan, follow me back to the living room, 
c&#39;mon girl.&quot;  Both the racer and Miko sweat dropped as the blonde girl 
followed Naru and the cake with eager wide eyes out the door and down 
the hall.
      
      &quot;Put me down now,&quot; Rei&#39;s voice was considerably calmer, though 
Haruka could sense she was still very angry and tense.
      
      The blonde tomboy sighed, &quot;I&#39;ll put you down, but you have to 
promise me not to make another scene.  It&#39;s Ami-chan&#39;s birthday for 
crying out loud, Rei.&quot;  All Haruka received in response was a growl and 
some incoherent mumbling.
      
      &quot;Now now, Rei-chan, You of all people need to be supportive of 
Ami-chan.&quot;
      
	The racer turned, Rei still in her arms, and the two found an 
amused Michiru standing in the doorway to the kitchen.  Haruka 
charmingly smiled towards her girlfriend, lifting the girl in her arms 
up a bit as though proud of her &#39;catch&#39; and wanting to show off.  Aqua 
eyes twinkled at the scene, a smile crossing the elegant girl&#39;s face as 
she walked towards them.

	&quot;I suppose you can put her down now, Haruka, we&#39;ve given her 
something to think about, at least,&quot; drawled the artist.

	Shrugging, the tall teen allowed her victim to slip from her arms 
and back onto the floor, receiving a dangerous glare from the girl in 
response.  Rei turned and was about to march out of the kitchen when the 
blonde girl moved swiftly in front of her, blocking the only exit.

	&quot;What the hell-...&quot; The Miko was interrupted by the obstruction.

	&quot;Rei, seriously, don&#39;t ruin this day for Ami-chan, just let Makoto 
stay.&quot;  Haruka&#39;s voice was unusually stern and her eyes were showing 
their true stubbornness.

	The raven haired girl looked down at the floor, her fists clenched 
tightly and her teeth noticeably grinding together, &quot;I am supportive of 
Ami-chan... and the best thing for her is to keep her away from that... 
that...&quot;  She closed her eyes and began to breathe through her nose and 
out her mouth, executing meditative techniques in order to calm herself.

	Michiru frowned as she watched the fiery teen fighting something 
internally and stepped forward, placing a comforting hand on the girl&#39;s 
shoulder, &quot;I know you want to protect her, she has that innocence about 
her that makes everyone want to shield her from the harmful things.  But 
I think she really does like Makoto... and Makoto likes her.  As her 
best friend, despite your own personal feelings, you should support her 
decision.&quot; Michiru squeezed the shoulder, &quot;Be there for her, Rei.&quot;

	Shrugging out of the musician&#39;s grasp, the Miko trudged angrily 
towards the window and stared outside into the darkness.  She wanted so 
much to tell Michiru and Haruka and all the rest of them about what that 
mysterious boy said to her, but she hadn&#39;t yet looked in the envelope.  
It was true, she didn&#39;t want to spoil the evening, which is why she hid 
the envelope in her room before joining the others; she decided she 
would make her decision later.

	But she hadn&#39;t counted on Kino being with the group and though she 
did know better than to react how she did, it couldn&#39;t have been helped.  
She leaned her head against the window, mumbling softly, &quot;Ami likes 
her...&quot;  She didn&#39;t want to admit it; she never wanted to admit it.  Ami 
was supposed to be hers, she put in the time, the effort, and she knows 
Ami probably better than the girl knows herself.  &quot;Why does Ami like 
her?!&quot; 

	Haruka and Michiru shared a frown as they listened to Rei choke 
out the last part with a sob.  Silently, the aqua haired girl moved up 
behind the raven haired girl and enveloped her in a hug.  Being this 
close to the girl, the artist could hear the quiet sobs coming from her, 
and she couldn&#39;t help but feel sympathetic towards the girl.

	&quot;She&#39;s supposed to like me... I&#39;m supposed to be the one... It 
can&#39;t be her...&quot;  Her voice was muffled by her arm as she tried to keep 
herself together; but feeling the older girl&#39;s arms around her, Rei 
wanted nothing more than to break down crying right there.

	The blonde sighed, running a hand through her cropped hair.  
Glancing back towards the door and down making sure no one was coming 
in, Haruka moved over by her girlfriend, &quot;Rei, get a grip.  Pull 
yourself back together... at least for tonight.&quot;

	Pulling out of Michiru&#39;s grasp, the Miko turned towards the two 
surprised teens showing a tear-streaked red face, &quot;YOU DON&#39;T 
UNDERSTAND!&quot; She raised her voice, only to mentally hush herself, and 
continued to speak in a loud, raspy whisper instead, &quot;You don&#39;t 
understand!  Everyone looks at this brute and sees a charming beast, but 
she&#39;s really just a beast!  She&#39;s a bad person!  She&#39;s... she&#39;s...&quot;

	No matter how much she tried, the hot tempered teen could not 
bring her self to say it; and she wanted to, oh how she did.  Revealing 
that damned devil hiding underneath the skin of the cool and popular 
Kino Makoto would bring such ease to her suffering and allow Ami to be 
hers again.  But she just couldn&#39;t do it.  It wasn&#39;t the right time for 
it; Rei felt something wasn&#39;t right, that the contents of that envelope 
needed to be checked first.  That was it.

	Taking a deep breath, the lavender eyed girl walked away from the 
concerned Haruka and Michiru and grabbed a napkin from the table, wiping 
away the remnants of the tears on her cheeks.  Tonight was for Ami-chan 
and she was not going to lose to the rogue.  Makoto may have made an 
impromptu visit and the genius might actually like her, but when push 
came to shove, it would be Rei who would stand victorious in the end; 
with or without the envelope&#39;s help.

	She looked back at the artist and her girlfriend, &quot;You&#39;re right, 
this is Ami-chan&#39;s night.  Gomen.&quot;

--------------------------------------------

	The stars were shining brightly and proudly in the dark sky, 
illuminating the earth below in a quaint gentle glow.  It was finally 
quiet on the shrine grounds, with just the small rustle of leaves from 
the occasional wind and the sounds of the forest animals that gathered 
in the small forest.  Despite the lateness of the evening, the air was 
still warm but not too warm to the point of being uncomfortable; it was 
warm enough to be just right.  Ami thought the only thing missing that 
would make this moment nearly perfect was a full radiant moon; it was 
merely a sliver at the moment, so dull even the stars out shone it.

	From behind her, the small girl was acutely aware that Makoto was 
enjoying a view other than the night sky and that view no doubt had blue 
hair.  A smile crept onto the genius&#39; lips as she sat down on the steps 
of the shrine, wrapping her arms around her legs.  That smile became 
larger when the chestnut haired tomboy slid down next to her, emerald 
eyes not moving from their point of interest.

	&quot;Happy Birthday again, Ami.&quot;  She reached over and placed a small 
wrapped box in the girl&#39;s lap.  &quot;Open it later.&quot;

	Unconsciously, the short teen felt goose bumps crawl over her skin 
at the closeness and sound of Makoto&#39;s tenor voice.  She blushed, 
looking down at the present in her lap.  &quot;Arigatou, Makoto...&quot;

	Sensing that the rogue was moving closer, the blue eyed girl 
turned abruptly meeting a pair of widened emerald eyes.  She felt her 
breath catch at how close the tall girl was and inhaled the intoxicating 
scent that could only belong to Kino Makoto.  Catching her self from 
falling too deep, Ami shook her head and blinked her eyes several times, 
trying to clear away the fogginess.

	&quot;I... I want to thank you for last night.&quot;  Her eyes fell 
downwards to Makoto&#39;s corduroys, studying how the folds of pants fell 
around the tall girl&#39;s legs as she continued, &quot;I feel a lot better.&quot;

	A smile crossed over the tomboy&#39;s lips and she stopped moving 
towards the genius and turned to look up into the night sky instead.  
&quot;That&#39;s good.&quot;  She was startled slightly when she felt a soft hand 
enclosing around her own; her gaze shot back down to see the small girl 
scooting closer.  &quot;A-ami...&quot;

	It was the blue haired teen&#39;s turn to smile.  She had never heard 
Makoto stutter before and for some reason, this act gave her an odd but 
very satisfying thrill.  How many times had the rogue been caught off 
guard?  Ami would bet that this a rare moment indeed.  Taking a deep 
breath, the small girl mustered up what was left of her courage and 
stared right into the tall girl&#39;s usually intense, but now curious, and 
perhaps a bit shaken, gaze.

	Despite the night&#39;s occurrences and Rei&#39;s hot temper, the genius 
felt things were much better and less confining; she was doing these 
things because she wanted to, not because she merely desired to be away 
from the unpleasantness.  The day was spent sorting things out 
emotionally and deciding what she really wanted because as Makoto 
suggested to her last night, she should just try to do the things that 
she wanted to do, not what was expected of her.

	Ami knew she knew all of this, but having someone tell her it was 
okay, being reassured that no matter what someone would stand by her 
decisions, it seemed to give her an air of confidence she lacked before.  
The rogue made her confident... Makoto gave her strength.  Letting go of 
the tall girl&#39;s hand, the small girl reached up and grazed her fingers 
across tanned cheeks, sighing happily when that cheek pressed into those 
fingers and against her hand.

	&quot;Where did this Ami come from?&quot;  Makoto&#39;s voice was soft and 
gentle, her eyes closed as she reveled in the touch of her blue haired 
classmate.

	The small girl giggled, her face reddening when she realized how 
bold she was being, but not stopping her tender caress, &quot;Your split 
personalities must be contagious.&quot;

	Emerald eyes peeked out through half open lids watching the cute 
girl before her blush embarrassedly.  Deciding that while being on the 
receiving end of such wonderful ministrations was fun, Makoto wanted 
desperately to reciprocate, but still felt ambivalent after last night.  
She still couldn&#39;t predict Ami&#39;s reactions and the girl was often too 
fidgety for her own good.  But it seemed, when the chestnut haired girl 
allowed her to take the lead, she was calm and unusually courageous.

	Still, curiosity got the better of her and she slowly moved her 
hand up towards the girl&#39;s round, pale face, stopping her fingertips 
just short of parted, light pink lips.  Before Makoto had a chance to 
gauge the small girl&#39;s reaction, those lips pressed themselves into the 
rough pads of her fingers, eliciting a quiet throaty gasp from the 
tomboy.  A smirk appeared on the genius&#39; face upon hearing the reaction 
and she dragged her lips down the long appendages, resting them in the 
middle of the rogue&#39;s hand.

	Makoto could only watch and swallow deeply at this new feeling; 
she felt her eyes glaze over with lust in watching the actions of the 
supposedly innocent blue haired girl.  Not to be outdone, though, the 
tall girl brought her free hand up, touching the sides of the small 
girl&#39;s face, bringing about another blush.  She grinned at this and took 
hold of the glasses on the girl&#39;s face.  When she received only another 
burning kiss into the palm of her hand in response, she pulled the 
glasses off the girl&#39;s face and stared directly into pure baby blue 
eyes.

	Ami&#39;s vision became blurry when the glasses disappeared from her 
face, but she didn&#39;t mind the least bit because she knew Makoto would 
look after her.  On instinct, she began to lean forward, watching as the 
tomboy came more in focus with each inch she moved.  She stopped when 
she heard Makoto speaking.

	&quot;Are you sure?&quot;  The rogue&#39;s voice was clearly hesitant, probably 
due to what happened yesterday when she tried to kiss the small girl.  
Feeling somewhat guilty about her actions yet again, the blue haired 
girl closed her eyes briefly and took a deep breath.  Makoto was so 
close now she could feel the hot breath on her lips and it made her 
shiver uncontrollably.  Where the tall girl was warm, the air now 
suddenly felt cold; she wanted to close the gap and get out of the 
frigid air and into the warmth of the girl in front of her.

	As her answer, Ami leaned forward and pressed her lips against the 
tomboy&#39;s, holding them there for several moments while she basked in the 
softness and strength.  Her senses became enflamed in the kiss, the 
world around her dissolved into the starry night above so that it seemed 
like it was only she and Makoto left, just for one another.  She 
received another pleasant jolt of feelings when the tomboy began to move 
her lips against the small girl&#39;s and softly moaned into the kiss.

	When the emerald eyed girl heard that moan, it only fueled her 
desire to deepen that kiss and she began to softly ravish the genius&#39; 
gentle and inviting lips, nibbling and sucking on them until she thought 
she would pass out from the sheer pleasure it was bringing her.  Makoto 
had only ever kissed one other person in her short life, but for some 
reason, she felt as though this was where she belonged, this was what 
she was made for.  Ami was her solace, her refuge... and the mere 
thought scared her.

	Something like this, something so great and so wonderful, surely 
the rogue was not allowed to partake in it, not with her past, not with 
her future.  She slowed her ravishing, realizing she needed to breathe, 
and pulled away feeling her heart tighten painfully when the blue haired 
girl followed, still desiring to hold that kiss and pecking at Makoto&#39;s 
own lips.  Resting her forehead against Ami&#39;s, the tall girl quietly 
caught her breath, secretly reveling in the soft caress of the small 
girl&#39;s hand still on her cheek.

	&quot;Wow,&quot; Ami was breathless as she spoke and the smile was evident 
in her voice as well.

	Makoto smiled in return, though she felt a twinge of sadness with 
it, and her heart wrenched once again.  Quickly, she leaned forward and 
gave the blue eyed girl a long, gentle kiss, pulling away slowly with 
Ami following her yet again.

	&quot;I&#39;m going to be gone for the next three days or so.&quot;

	The genius&#39; eyes softened, a gloomy smile plastered on her face as 
she looked into cloudy emerald eyes.  &quot;Okay,&quot; she said, though a part of 
her wanted to ask the chestnut haired teen to stay, she also wanted some 
time to sort this out on her own.

	Makoto brushed her thumb across the small girl&#39;s lips, &quot;Just okay, 
hmm?&quot;  She smirked.

	Ami giggled and leaned forward against the thumb on her lips, 
kissing it softly.  She wondered silently when she became such an 
affectionate person, especially around this brutish, multiple 
personality, secretive rogue.  Shaking her head, not wanting to consider 
such things at the moment, she spoke softly, &quot;Skipping classes isn&#39;t 
going to be good for your grades... but you&#39;re going to do what you want 
no matter what, right?&quot;  Looking earnestly at the tall girl, she 
continued, &quot;Just be careful.&quot;

	Unable to resist the cute look on the girl&#39;s face, Makoto leaned 
in for another chaste kiss, &quot;I&#39;m always careful,&quot; she whispered in the 
girl&#39;s ear after pulling away.  With much reluctance, the tomboy backed 
away from Ami and stood up.  &quot;I better go now.&quot;

	Baby blue eyes looked slightly crestfallen, but understood why; 
the raven haired reason was not too far away at the moment.

	&quot;I&#39;ll call you when I get back.&quot;

	The blue haired girl smiled, grabbing up the present in her lap 
and standing up as well, &quot;I&#39;ll look forward to it.&quot;

	Makoto nodded and turned to walk down the steps.  She paused after 
a few steps and looked back towards the porcelain face at the top, &quot;You 
really should talk to her, Ami.  I know I can&#39;t force you into doing it, 
especially so quickly, but it might clear up a lot of things for you.&quot;

	Ami felt her head droop downwards, a small frown forming on her 
features.  She made a noise of understanding as she stared at the 
wrapped box in her hands.  Makoto nodded and continued her descent back 
down the steps.  When the small girl realized that her classmate was 
leaving, she looked back up quickly and watched the tomboy until she was 
enveloped by the darkness.

	With a small sigh, the genius sat back down on the steps and 
looked back up at the sky, whispering to the stars, &quot;I&#39;ll try, 
Makoto...&quot;

---------------------------

	At the bottom of the stairs, the rogue was greeted with a familiar 
face stepping out from in front of the gates of the shrine.

	&quot;Hotaru, how&#39;s the hand?&quot;

	The dark haired girl rolled her eyes at her the tall girl, &quot;I 
still can&#39;t believe that idiot, honestly.&quot;  She moved next to Makoto, 
who was currently looking back up towards the shrine building, &quot;Nice 
kiss?&quot;

	The tomboy grinned, &quot;Who knows...&quot;

	Hotaru chuckled a moment before becoming completely serious, 
&quot;Makoto, Rei has something...&quot;

	Emerald eyes narrowed at the underclassman, &quot;What happened?&quot;

	The two began to walk down the sidewalk while the photographer 
conveyed to her everything that had gone on between Rei and the 
mysterious chubby boy earlier, not leaving a single detail out.  Makoto 
remained silent during it, only nodding from time to time, but never 
letting any surprise or emotions show.  When Hotaru finished, the rogue 
continued to walk on in silence for several minutes, still not ready to 
respond.

	&quot;Let me go with you tomorrow...&quot;

	Makoto shook her head, &quot;No, you&#39;re my alibi.&quot;

	The purple eyed girl growled, &quot;We&#39;ll make a different alibi!  With 
this boy around, it only confirms that they really are watching us.&quot;

	The two girls stopped at an empty intersection and waited for the 
signal for them to walk across.  Turning to the small girl, the chestnut 
haired girl began to speak calmly, &quot;We do know they&#39;re watching us... 
but I feel like this incident, while not entirely unrelated, isn&#39;t 
something directly correlated with them.&quot;  She shrugged and turn back 
towards the intersection, &quot;I&#39;ve made lots of enemies being who I am... 
these enemies don&#39;t necessarily know about The Abyss, so there&#39;s a good 
chance that I&#39;m probably just being attacked for what I&#39;ve done and not 
who I am.&quot;

	Hotaru sighed, but nodded in understanding.

	&quot;You stay, keep an eye out for anyone that might fit the 
description of that boy or anyone suspicious around Ami and Rei... he 
might go to the school if he&#39;s been trying to warn Ami,&quot;  Purple eyes 
glanced down to see the tall girl&#39;s fists clenched.

	&quot;You think Ami-san is in danger?&quot;  She asked Makoto hesitantly.

	The signal changed, indicating for them to walk across.  As they 
walked, the rogue crossed her arms over her chest, staring ahead 
emotionless and she talked, &quot;I doubt it... not yet at least.  Rei&#39;s the 
one really in danger now; if it&#39;s true what&#39;s in that envelope... they 
aren&#39;t going to like that.&quot;

	Hotaru closed her eyes and sighed.

	&quot;Anyways, I better go.  I&#39;ll check back in three days, no matter 
what happens.  If you don&#39;t hear from me by then... it&#39;s more than 
likely they&#39;ve gotten a hold of me.  If that&#39;s the case, you better
