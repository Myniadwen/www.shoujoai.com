4215 AD
Colony World Idun

It was their last day on Idun before the launch of the Vanguard.The 
impressive vessel was the first of a brand new ship class developed by 
the united colonies. It was assembled at the Idun docks, built with Earl 
metals, armed with Earth weaponry, and run by a diverse crew from all 
corners of the known territories. Because of all the anticipation, the 
crew was stripped of the free time that they should have been allowed. 
Instead of staying home with their families, they were forced to mingle 
with socialites and attend highly boring parties thrown by companies or 
media organizations. This was such a night. Spending several months 
alone in space was starting to sound less and less like &#39;duty&#39; and more 
like a relief.

All Natsuki truly wanted to do was go ride her bike up and down the 
coastal highways. That would have been bliss. This was a party that she 
was not allowed to skip. She was forced to attend both as a member of 
the Border Guards... and as a daughter. Saeko Kuga had helped create the 
AI system that was going to run the ship while the crew was in 
cryosleep. She was also going to attend the final party, hosted by Shin 
Fujino. It was an industry affair that was taking place at Fujino&#39;s 
mountain estate. The only consolation was that there was likely to be 
food... and wine. That was going to come in handy.

Natsuki arrived at the Fujino estate with her group of friends, most of 
whom she had met during the pre-launch celebrations earlier that week. 
Some she had known since her days at the academy. None of them were 
particularly excited about the final send off. The only two who were 
anxious to get moving were Midori and Youko. That was, again, because of 
the wine. A medical officer like Youko should have known better than to 
drink so much, but she and Midori were subject to the &#39;work hard, play 
hard&#39; mentality.

&quot;Shit. Any more time around these rich bitches and I&#39;ll start to be a 
dull as they are. It&#39;s like an infectious disease,&quot; Nao spat as they 
walked up the stone stairs that led to the entrance of the estate.

A young blonde, a teen prodigy who was working in the 
Vanguard&#39;sengineering department, was not amused by Nao&#39;s whining. &quot;I 
think you just like to complain. Had you been a little more resourceful, 
you could have just run off for the night.&quot;

Oi, don&#39;t try to start a fight again, Alyssa... Natsuki thought.

&quot;Little twirp,&quot; Nao shot back. &quot;You&#39;re one to talk. Why didn&#39;t you run 
away?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m here because of familial duty. You&#39;re here because you couldn&#39;t 
think up an escape route in time. I can&#39;t help but wonder how you Border 
Guard soldiers, despite all your training, manage to miss these 
opportunities.&quot;

I mean it. I&#39;m not bailing you out again and your robot isn&#39;t here to 
cause collateral damage in your name.

Luckily, Mai, who was going to work in the mess hall, stepped in before 
either woman tried to kill each other. &quot;I&#39;m sure the Fujino family would 
not appreciate blood being spilled all over these nice, clean steps. Go 
back to your corners!&quot;

&quot;If there&#39;s any hostility between us before the launch, our great team 
won&#39;t be able to function as it should, leaving us open to the perils of 
evi--&quot;

&quot;Shutup,Midori.&quot; Nao had had just about enough of this &#39;team dedicated 
to truth and justice&#39; crap. She&#39;d only met the mad scientist yesterday 
and she was already starting to lose her mind. Had this woman been 
dropped on her head right after birth? Life was not a space ranger show.

Natsuki sighed as she saw two people approach their group. &quot;Everyone be 
quiet and act like civilized people. Here comes the first wave of 
annoyance.&quot;

They all put on fake smiles as a pair of attendants greeted them just 
outside the main gate. There, they endured countless questions and 
praise that they had all heard before. They were quickly taken inside, 
escorted towards the hall that the festivities were going to take place 
in. There, they sat through their captain&#39;s well rehearsed speech, 
something he repeated verbatim at every conference. Photographers and 
well wishers began to make their lives living hell. It was difficult to 
get either Nao or the Kuga sisters to smile for any camera. It would 
have hurt too much, they said, and they needed to be in prime condition.

&quot;Tanya, do you have my eyeshadow?&quot;

&quot;You look fine.&quot;

Milena sighed and went through half her vanity before turning back to 
her sister, who sat next to the window reading a magazine. Tanya was 
decked out in full dress and makeup, and was waiting rather impatiently 
for her elder sister to finish up. Her lack of cooperation was causing 
delays. &quot;Tanya, could I borrow some of yours?&quot;

She flipped to another page, not looking up. &quot;You keep using all mine up 
whenever I come over. Maybe you should just learn to organize your 
things better. Take a lesson from that anal-retentive husband of yours.&quot;

While Milena Fujino was calm and collected in most situations, it was 
Tanya who was an expert at making her act out just a little. &quot;Tanya, if 
you don&#39;t help me, I&#39;m going to sock you right in the face. This is no 
time for games! We have very important people out there.&quot;

&quot;Do you think that you look like a deformed monster when you don&#39;t have 
any eyeshadow-- Oh, my.&quot; Tanya paused and looked out the window. There 
was the group of crewmen, all being harassed by other guests. &quot;Don&#39;t you 
just love it when you can see that &#39;leave me alone or I&#39;ll kill you&#39; 
look on their face? The poor things!&quot;

&quot;Eyeshadow.&quot;

&quot;Do you just want to marry the eyeshadow?&quot;

&quot;You aren&#39;t ten years old. Don&#39;t try to argue like a child.&quot;

&quot;Fine. I&#39;ll argue like I&#39;m your parent. Why are you only now getting 
ready? Shouldn&#39;t you have done this hours ago?&quot;

All right, this wasn&#39;t worth it. There was one more female in the 
family, and she wasn&#39;t quite so difficult to get along with. Milena 
would just have to go to her for help. Walking down the hall, and 
ignoring the subsequent taunting yells from her sister, she knocked 
softly on her daughter&#39;s bedroom door. It opened a few moments later, 
and there was her lovely child dressed in a proper violet kimono. Her 
brunette hair was partially tied back, only a few strands left to frame 
her delicate face.

&quot;Shizuru, could I borrow some of your eyeshadow?&quot; Milena asked.

&quot;Of course.&quot; The request was puzzling, but she never the less complied. 
She opened the door further and both women retreated into the room. 
Shizuru went to her bathroom and removed several cases of the stuff, 
allowing her mother to choose which one would best match her lavender 
kimono. In a rush, her mother began to apply the best choice, and 
Shizuru couldn&#39;t help but laugh at how anxious she was. &quot;I take it you 
lost your own again.&quot;

&quot;It would have been far easier if your aunt had not been born with the 
Dragunov smartass gene,&quot; she replied, touching up her work. &quot;She loves 
to be difficult at the worst possible moments.&quot;

&quot;Please relax, Mother. You look wonderful.&quot;

Milena smiled. &quot;Thank you. Now, this is not a business meeting, so 
please don&#39;t feel obligated to act the part of diplomat. I imagine 
you&#39;ll have your fill of that on the ship. It&#39;s your send off as well, 
after all, so just try to enjoy everything.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll manage,&quot; Shizuru said with a wink. In the 
mirror, she could see her mother&#39;s face fall slightly at the thought of 
Shizuru going away for so long. Feeling a twinge of guilt, Shizuru bent 
forward and wrapped her arms around her mother, leaning her face against 
her mother&#39;s own. &quot;It&#39;s only for a year. I&#39;ll be back before you know 
it.&quot;

&quot;And what if you get it through your head to stay on after the trials? 
You&#39;ll be gone for years on end, and I&#39;ll be stuck with that thing in 
the other room.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s no way to address Aunt Tanya,&quot; Shizuru chastised, even if she 
knew her mother was only kidding. She then turned serious again. &quot;I&#39;m 
only going on this trip because it was requested. Somehow my superiors 
trust my charm more than the regular diplomat&#39;s trickery. Besides, it 
will look good on the resume. It won&#39;t be a permanent thing.&quot;

&quot;If you say so, Shizuru. Regardless, we&#39;d better get going. We can&#39;t 
stay in the house much longer without your fathering coming to find us.&quot; 
Milena stood, and she and Shizuru went back into the hall. As they began 
the descent down a flight of fine wooden stairs, Milena called back out 
to her sister. &quot;Tanya! We&#39;re going!&quot;

&quot;Time to have fun tormenting the frightened deer lined up outside, 
then?&quot; Tanya asked, moving to follow the both of them.

- - -

&quot;Kuga-san, your daughters are exceedingly beautiful!&quot;

Fifteen year old Alyssa averted her gaze, not falling for Shin Fujino&#39;s 
charm. Natsuki acted as if she had not even heard it. Saeko, however, 
laughed politely. &quot;Yes, they are. Unfortunately, they&#39;re just as 
sarcastic as they are lovely.&quot;

Somehow, he only seemed more intrigued by that idea. He opened his mouth 
to say something, but was cut off by his approaching wife. The tall 
beauty linked her arm with his and gave the Kuga family a warm smile. 
&quot;Hello, my name is Milena Fujino. I hope you&#39;re enjoying your stay so 
far. Has everything been adequate?&quot;

&quot;Everything is wonderful. It&#39;s nice to finally meet you,&quot; Saeko said 
cordially.

Shin gave his wife a quick peck on the cheek. &quot;Well, I see you&#39;ve 
brought Tanya, but where has Shizuru gone?&quot;

Milena turned back, surprised that her daughter had left her. Given the 
media presence, it was probably for the best. Shizuru did not like noise 
or frantic questioning. &quot;She must have gone off to do her own thing. I 
gave her the night off, you might say. It&#39;s a shame she didn&#39;t come out 
here to at least met you Kuga girls, though. She should be about your 
age, Natsuki.&quot;

Fascinating.

&quot;Perhaps you&#39;ll see her sometime this evening,&quot; Saeko said to her girls. 
&quot;I&#39;m sure you two don&#39;t want to hear all this business talk, so why 
don&#39;t you go hang out with your friends for a little while? I&#39;ll join 
you for dinner.&quot;

The old &#39;go play with your friends&#39; order. How well we know it. Natsuki 
escorted her younger sister away from the adults, heading to the table 
where their companions were sitting. There it was plain to see that 
Youko and Midori were in some kind of drinking contest, Midori 
occasionally pausing to bicker with Nao, who sat on the other side of 
her. They had always been like that, and likely always would. It was for 
the best. With Midori&#39;s constant cheeriness in Nao&#39;s face, the brawler 
was more likely to focus her snide comments onto her rather than 
Natsuki.

&quot;Do you think we can escape?&quot; Natsuki eventually asked her younger 
sister.

&quot;Yes, but she would find us and skin us sooner than later.&quot;

Natsuki snorted. &quot;I&#39;m still waiting for you to make robotic duplicates 
of us, so that we can use them to avoid these little messes. What is 
taking you so long?&quot;

&quot;I keep trying to make yours, but I can&#39;t find any metal cones small 
enough to properly mimic your non-existent chest.&quot; The blonde swiftly 
ducked out of the way of a swinging arm. Instead of Alyssa, Natsuki hit 
a man serving drinks, who had the misfortune of walking on Alyssa&#39;s 
other side as the attack occurred. He stumbled back and they held their 
breaths, but he managed to regain his balance before the drinks took a 
tumble. He quickly scurried away, and Alyssa couldn&#39;t help but laugh at 
her more brutish sister.

As they neared the table, Natsuki looked down at the objects under 
scrutiny. &quot;Mine are just fine, thank you very much.&quot;

Both sat down at the table with their friends, and each grabbed one of 
the complimentary sandwiches left out by the staff. In unison, they 
grabbed their favorite condiments and splattered the sandwich interior 
until it was soaked. Mayonnaise for Natsuki, ketchup for Alyssa. This 
was enough to draw Nao&#39;s attention away from Midori. The redhead 
convulsed in disgust and made a face.

&quot;You can&#39;t be serious!&quot; She exclaimed.

&quot;You should try it before you judge,&quot; Natsuki countered.

&quot;I don&#39;t have to taste shit to know it&#39;s disgusting.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not healthy!&quot; Chimed the health advertisement known as Mai 
Tokiha. She largely went ignored by the elder Kuga sister.

Alyssa smirked slightly at Nao. &quot;Maybe you won&#39;t try it because you&#39;re 
too chicken?&quot;

&quot;Why you...!&quot;

Natsuki stared off into space while Mai dealt with the little fight 
breaking out at the table. She finished her sandwich in silence and let 
her eyes wander around the estate. It really was a lovely place. Had it 
not been populated with so many irritating people, she might have liked 
it. She tried to bring herself back into the conversation, but hearing 
Nao complain about how Ensign Lu had grabbed her ass earlier that day 
was enough to make Natsuki tune back out again.

Her eyes swept over a trail that led into a forested area of the &#39;back 
yard.&#39; Thinking that some kind of adventure would be much better than 
what she&#39;d been offered, Natsuki stood without warning and dropped what 
was left of her sandwich on the table. When Alyssa saw her sister&#39;s 
intentions, she tried to grab at Natsuki&#39;s leather coat, but to no 
avail. Dammit! Now she was going to be stuck there with the crazy people 
and left at the mercy of socialites. What a strong, protective sister!

And so, Natsuki began to walk off towards the private trail, and Alyssa 
was left to fend for herself, enduring Midori&#39;s long winded recap of the 
last action series that ran on the video streams. In great detail.

- - -

The path was indeed very beautiful, and Natsuki enjoyed looking at the 
scenery. It was private and peaceful. She continued on and found a small 
pond nestled between a cluster of old trees that had no doubt stood 
there for generations. Standing before the pond, however, was a young 
woman Natsuki&#39;s age. She was surrounded by pink flowers that had just 
recently bloomed. She must have heard Natsuki approach, because she was 
pulled out of whatever reverie she had been in before.

A violet colored kimono covered a sinful body, and long sandy brown hair 
drifted with the wind. She had the same piercing red eyes as the other 
family members, but something about them was very different. Very 
foreign, but very familiar. Something in Natsuki&#39;s heart twisted.

She stood there transfixed for several moments. It was very seldom that 
Natsuki found anyone beautiful, and she was not quite sure exactly what 
she was feeling. There was just something about that woman that held 
Natsuki in place, unable to move. The kind of power frightened her, but 
she was calmed by those red eyes in the moments that followed. There was 
something soothing in them.

Shizuru didn&#39;t like having this many people over to her home. It was an 
invasion of privacy, wasn&#39;t it? She understood her father&#39;s need to get 
everyone on good terms with everyone, but couldn&#39;t it have been done 
elsewhere? Or at a different time? She stood by a pond within the 
secluded part of their land, having snuck away from the gathering 
crowds. You could only introduce yourself so many times before suicide 
looked like a more entertaining action to take. She was good at being 
diplomatic and kind, and was just that when it came to her mother&#39;s 
co-workers. Shizuru would do her best to aid her parents, but all she 
wanted was a break. She was making the most of it.

She&#39;d have to go back eventually, wouldn&#39;t she? Oh, but just a little 
longer. Her eyes watched the surface of the water, taking in every 
ripple and movement while she listened to the birds chirp around her. 
She shut those very eyes a moment later, and let her ears resume 
observation. Her breathing was slow and rhythmic as she listened to 
every sound that nature provided. Birds, leaves rustling in the wind, 
small animals darting from one branch to another.

A twig snapping. Oh? Had she been found out?

Shizuru stood and turned to face the intruder who had disrupted her 
tranquil reflections. No, this wasn&#39;t a parent coming to escort her 
back. This one had long dark hair and captivating green eyes that looked 
surprised and somewhat fearful at the same time. What a wonderful 
expression this girl held. She was absolutely the most beautiful 
creature that Shizuru had ever had the pleasure of seeing. Shizuru knew 
nothing of her, but was almost instantly bewitched. Something within 
told her that this was something that was not a disturbance, but a 
blessing. She could not help but smile and draw near, like a moth to a 
flame.

- - -

&quot;Hello. My name is Shizuru. What&#39;s yours?&quot;

A moment of shy hesitation. &quot;...Natsuki.&quot;
