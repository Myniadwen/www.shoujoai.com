<h1>Echoes of a Final Duel (part 10 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/echoduel-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Arisugawa Juri walked in with confidence, the orange
haired woman looking over the people gathered in the
main room of the unopened club thoughtfully. Around
them tables had just been shipped in, the bar was
mostly together but plastic covers and equipment still
lingered, the last preperations continuing.

Ryouko and Minagi stood together at one side, the
twins remarkably alike with their light blue hair and
catlike eyes. The facial scars on Minagi marked her as
different, that and a clear softness in her eyes.
Sasami stood beside Minagi, her own lighter hair tied
in twin ponyails, looking childlike despite her
advanced age. All three wore the oddly kimono like
garb of the alien Jurai, though both Ryouko and
Minagi&#39;s were much more skin tight.

Excel and Hyatt stood together, one of the odder
pairings in the group. The blonde haired Excel was
almost constantly in motion, bouncing restlessly while
the black haired Hyatt was languid, almost lethargic
as she leaned up against a chair. Their matching
bodysuits were a bit unusual, too, but both carried
them off quite well.

Keiko looked nervous as she stood to one side, her
brown hair in twin ponytails, curls of hair bouncing
against her forehead. She looked young, somehow in her
achingly formal dress, more due to lack of confidence
than age, but she still managed to give Juri a brave
smile.

May, not far away, had reflexedly pulled a cover from
a table and the red and white clad maid was cleaning
away thoughtfully. The busty brown haired woman was
always sweet and good natured, but Juri still had a
hard time getting a reading on her. Part of that might
be her sense that May would be just as happy and
pleasant cleaning sewage...

&#39;That&#39;s not quite fair,&#39; Juri reminded herself
guiltily, turning her gaze to the other mysterious
lady who was looking over the library.

Over the months working on converting the warehouse to
a nightclub Juri had gotten to know Hitomi pretty
well, but the college student still seemed
otherworldly. Her short light brown hair framed a
sweet face, her body slim and athletic and having a
mind remarkably sharp. Yet as seemingly normal as she
seemed to be Hitomi had very unusual gifts; like
prophetic visions and most unusually the ability to
travel to other dimensions.

&quot;Nervous?&quot; the familiar voice asjed as she walked up
to Juri. Tendo Nabiki was dressed in business wear,
her black suit snug on her body, her black hair
falling to the base of her neck. The business manager
of the Locket carried a clipboard under her arm, as
well as a personal organizer tucked in a pocket.
&quot;We&#39;re going to be ready to go on schedule, you know,&quot;
she reminded Juri.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m nervous,&#39; Juri said, &quot;this is a big step.&quot;

&quot;You started this months ago,&quot; Nabiki pointed out to
her quietly, &quot;this is just finishing what you began
then.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Juri admitted, &quot;but after this I&#39;m commited
and I&#39;ve pulled all of them in, too...&quot;

&quot;Nobody folowed you here blindly,&quot; Nabiki reminded
her. She clapped Juri on the shoulder, &quot;They&#39;re
waiting.. you ready to go?&quot;

Juri took a deep breath and nodded, &quot;Yes.&quot;

Nabiki led the way over to the bar, turning to face
everyone as she said, &quot;Welcome to the first staff
meeting of Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.&quot;

Juri took a deep breath, following with, &quot;As you can
see the last work is being finished, but we&#39;ll be open
in a few days.&quot; She looked over old friends and new as
she said, &quot;I thought I should give everyone a rundown
of what to expect.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going to be working in a lesbian bar,&quot; Ryouko
said with a impish air, &quot;I think we know what to
expect.&quot;

Juri grinned, glad that her friend was helping break
the tension a bit. &quot;Maybe so,&quot; she said, &quot;but I
thought I should cover all the bases.&quot; Calmly Juri
spelled out how the bar was to operate, as well as the
sort of customers they might end up getting. She also
explained the areas of responsibility each staff
member would be handling.

&quot;So Ryouko and I can bring in any drinks we want to?&quot;
Minagi&#39;s eyes lit up, &quot;Sweet!&quot;

&quot;Just keep our budget in mind,&quot; Nabiki warned them
both sternly. She looked over at Sasami too, &quot;I&#39;m
sorry we won&#39;t be able to bring in more than minimal
kitchen help for a bit, though I hope other staff can
help out.&quot;

Sasami bowed, ponytails bouncing as she said, &quot;I&#39;ll do
my best.&quot;

&quot;Any other questions?&#39; Juri asked as she looked out
over the group.

&quot;How are we going to handle the transgendered?&quot; Keiko
asked a bit hesitantly. Feeling the other&#39;s eyes
resting on her she blushed, &quot;I did some reading after
Juri confirmed I was hired.&quot;

&quot;A case by case basis, probably,&quot; Juri admitted. &quot;It&#39;s
a complicated issue but I&#39;m going to try to avoid
excluding them, if at all possible.&quot;

&quot;I was pretty impressed by the library,&quot; Hitomi looked
faintly amused, &quot;where did you get that many lesbian
books?&quot;

Nabiki looked amused, &quot;The core is Juri&#39;sd own
collection, the rest of them we bought online or
raiding the bookstores here in Tokyo.&quot;

&quot;How are we going to keep any undesireables out?&quot;
Excel asked, a somewhat dangerous glint in her eyes.

&quot;An old friend of mine named Washu claims to have
solved that,&quot; Juri answered,. &quot;though I&#39;m not quite
sure how. I&#39;m also looking around for a bouncer, so if
you&#39;ve got a imposing friend who wants a job let me
know.&quot;

&quot;Anything else?&quot; Nabiki looked around and there was
calm silence.

&quot;All right,&quot; Juri said firmly, &quot;the workers say that
we&#39;ll be ready to open in a week. We&#39;ll be stocking
supplies this week, too, so I&#39;d like you all here a
few hours before opening to check everythig over a
final time. Got it?&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Ryouko nodded, indicating agreemernt
from the rest of the group.

Once everyone else left Juri went upstairs, hearing
the sound of the construction workers finishing off
the last few suites on this level. The bedrooms here
were Nabiki&#39;s idea, a concept Juri was a bit leery of,
but as Nabiki had pointed out it was dangerous for two
women to rent a room, so why not offer it here?

Opening up the door to her new office Juri went
inside, passing a new couch to the desk she and Nabiki
would use for paperwork. The leather seat sighed
softly as she sat, then Juri sat back, taking a deep
relaxing breath.

&quot;You make good speeches,&quot; Nabiki noted from the
doorway, the black haired woman leaning up against the
doorway.

Juri sat back with a sigh, &quot;Here&#39;s hoping I don&#39;t have
to do this very often.&quot;

Nabiki went over to a mini-bar up on one wall, taking
down a bottle she had put there a few days ago. &quot;You
want one?&quot; she asked, holding a clean glass.

&quot;Jusr ginger-ale, please,&quot; Juri said with a smile.

&quot;Seriously?&quot; Nabiki raised a eyebrow while she poured
from one of the other bottles.

&quot;I don&#39;t mind drinking, but around here drinking on
the job would be a bad idea,&quot; Juri shrugged. As Nabiki
sat down Juri flashed her a grin, &quot;Thank you for all
your help.&quot;

&quot;Just paying off my borrowing your couch,&quot; Nabiki
joked.

&quot;How&#39;s the new apartment?&#39; Juri asked curiously,
sipping her soda.

&quot;Pretty good,&quot; Nabiki grinned at her, &quot;though I&#39;d love
to know how you found a cheap apartment in this city.&quot;

&quot;Friend of a friend network,&quot; Juri explained.

&quot;So,&quot; Nabiki gave her a searching look, &quot;how does it
feel to be at the point where your months of work is
going to be paying off?&quot;

&quot;A little scary, but good,&quot; Juri said after a moment.
A slight smile touched her lips, &quot;I guess we&#39;ll know
more once opening night is here.&quot;

To be continued... in Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.

Notes: I&#39;m almost tempted to add this fic on to
Arisugawa&#39;s locket as a long &#39;prelude&#39; but I think
adding ten more chapters to that already long fic
would be a bit much. I hope you enjoyed this
introduction to the cast and keep reading my other
fics, too.

The Staff: The bar&#146;s owner is Arisugawa Juri, from
Revolutionary Girl Utena. Minagi, Ryouko and Sasami
are from the series Tenchi Muyo. Keiko is also from
Utena. Cyberdoll May is from Hand Maid May. Excel and
Hyatt are from Excel Saga. Hitomi is from Escaflowne,
