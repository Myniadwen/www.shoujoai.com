<a href="../crossover/keepbro-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&quot;Fucking hell, what does a king need to get some bloody sleep round 
here?&quot; Gary moaned as he got out of bed as the neighbour&#39;s son Shin Chan 
was screaming as if he was in a football pitch someone kill that fucking 
child. Now he was married to a Queen he has been very unhappy because as 
the monarch she has strong responsibilities that drift her away from 
him.&nbsp;God, you are fucking retard. He was asked by divorced aunt and 
uncle to look out for Matt and TK his cousins, for some reason he 
agreed, 

&quot;Matt&quot; Gary called out &quot;where are you?&quot;&nbsp;Gary noticed Takeru A.K.A TK 
alone in his room in an anti socialising way. Poor Takeru, Gary thought 
how could that slapper do that to him? Then back to Matt the musician, 
Gary assumed he&#39;d be in the bathroom having sex with Mimi. This is 
what&#39;s been happening since the parents left the house.&nbsp;&quot;Matt&quot; Gary 
called out &quot;where the fucking hell are you&quot; then there was a bang on the 
bathroom door, Gary knew what was going on, yet he didn&#39;t want to 
imagine, Gary stormed to the bathroom and knocked on the door hearing 
grunts and moans, they where having sex &quot;Matt&quot; Gary frowned&nbsp;&quot;get out I 
know you&#39;re there, you&#39;ve been there for the past half hour&quot; 

&quot; I don&#39;t think you want to that Gary?&quot; Matt replied 

&quot;I think you&#39;ll find I fucking well do,&quot; Gary snapped then the door 
opened the bathroom door two naked bodies, he shut the door straight 
away. &quot;Chisato,&quot; Gary asked, &quot; Did you have a haircut?&quot; 

&quot;No&quot; Matt replied, &quot;This is Sora&quot; 

&quot;Hi&quot; Sora replied Gary started to get angry, vomiting swears words. 

&quot; Matt&quot; Gary muttered, &quot; You&#39;re a fucking disgrace to the bloody entire 
family&quot; bloody 

&quot; Japan is part of the Jetiendo empire&quot; Matt replied &quot; and their ain&#39;t 
no laws in Jetiendo&quot; 

Then the door opened with clothes on Gary just muttered, &quot; That bloody 
doesn&#39;t fucking mean the bloody Japanese laws have bloody changed.&quot; 

&quot;Gary&quot; TK said miserably 

At last TK got out of his room. Gary instantly shut the door. 

&quot;Takeru&quot; Gary replied, &quot;Are you ok now?&quot; 

&quot;Not really&quot; TK moaned his once happy face was crashed. &quot;Is Matt in the 
bathroom with a girl?&quot; 

Gary hesitated &quot;eh....&quot; He was about to say no but Sora and Matt left 
the bathroom 

&quot;Morning TK&quot; Sora smiled as she buttoned up her top to look more 
presentable left the department. 

&quot;Matt I think we need to talk&quot; Gary replied. TK returned to his room 
slammed the door as his phone was going off. 

&quot;Gary&quot; Matt asked, &quot; Why are you acting such a jerk?&quot; 

&quot;I think you&#39;re the jerk round here!&quot; Gary replied 

&quot;I can&#39;t being lecherous&quot; Matt replied &quot;besides it&#39;s all in the package, 
pop star meets this nice girl and has sex big deal&quot; 

&quot;Matt&quot; Gary moaned, &quot; You are a talented boy...&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m a talented boy who has a libido&quot; Matt interrupted, then a momement 
of silence &quot; I get it now, you and Tasha don&#39;t have sex.&quot; Gary started 
to get embarrassed.&nbsp;&quot;Oh Coz,&quot; Matt gasped &quot; I should&#39;ve foreseen this, 
who could blame ya for being jealous of your own cousin!&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re on about&quot; Gary lied 

&quot;Exactly&quot; Matt replied, &quot;Who could blame you, Queen Natasha Lilac, the 
majestic holy virgin. Whose husband treats her like venom&quot; 

&quot;Ok Matt that&#39;s enough&quot; Gary replied 

&quot;It&#39;s true,&quot; Matt replied as he read a rock star magazine. Then someone 
opened the door it was Tasha, 

&quot;Hey Tasha&quot; Gary called out as Tasha entered the room as they hugged 
eachother, Matt looked at him as if he wasn&#39;t approved. TK entered the 
room in a sad gloomy style entering the fridge. All three faces had a 
look of concern. 

&quot;Anyway&quot; Tasha replied, &quot;I have to go, check up on my brother&quot; 

&quot;Ok&quot; Gary replied &quot; se ya later&quot; 

As Tasha left the department Matt said &quot; see, you&#39;re a twat to her, you 
treat her like shit&quot; then Matt walked out of the room. 

&quot;Has a point ya know&quot; TK muttered as he shut the door with his phone in 
his hand. 

&quot;Takeru&quot; Gary said walking up to him, &quot;I wanna know if there&#39;s something 
wrong,&quot; TK ignored him. &quot;Come on&quot; Gary snapped, &quot;You can&#39;t still love 
that tart&quot; TK then showed the film that Kari had sent her, the one with 
Misty and Kari doing extreme sex while her baby Rosette was there, Gary 
felt physically sick. </pre>
