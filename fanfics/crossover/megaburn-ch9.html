&quot;Sylia,&quot; the female voice groaned, &quot;you promised!&quot;

&quot;Just let me check this call,&quot; Sylia Stingray
promised, her night gown slightly messy.

The distorted voice made Sylia Stingray raise an
elegant eyebrow, but the message made the silver
haired business woman sit up and take notice. &#39;Did
they actually say what I thought they did?&#39; she
wondered, running the file over again.

&quot;We wish to contract with the Knight Sabers,&quot; the
artificial voice began, &quot;your reputation is
impressive, and your capabilities in urban combat
would be useful. A major operation is begining in
Megatokyo soon, and we would appreciate your help.&quot;

&quot;Urban combat in Megatokyo?&quot; Mara asked, the tawny
haired younger woman smiling at her lover as they
reclined on the bed together.

&quot;Not a pleasant thought,&quot; Sylia agreed, removing the
slim data storage device from her private computer.
Her expressio was thoughtful, &quot;Voice analysis has come
up nil, implying the entire message was artificially
created.&quot;

&quot;And no real information on their objectives or
identity,&quot; Mara quietly noted, &quot;other than an email
address from a free public service.&quot; She sighed,
seeing that Sylia was now entirely focused on the
problem in front of her and decided to add, &quot;Wonder if
it&#39;s connected to the corporate espionage Nene is
worried about?&quot;

Sylia paused, her eyes narrowing slightly in thought.
&quot;The timing is quite the coincidence,&quot; she admitted,
reaching across the bed for the phone. She dialed,
listening to the ring, then once it was picked up she
asked, &quot;AD Police? Could I speak with Officer
Romanova, please?&quot; She listened to the answer, &quot;Ah,
thank you.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Mara asked, watching as Sylia put the phone
down.

&quot;A new wrinkle to the situation,&quot; Sylia mused,
&quot;there&#39;s been a shooking, one of the employees at a
company involved with Nene&#39;s case, she&#39;s out checking
it out now.&quot;

The AD Police cruiser skidded to a halt in front of
the hospital, the passenger door fling open almost as
soon as the car halted. Nene jumperd out, only
sticking her head inside to say, &quot;Lisa, park the car
and follow me in, I may need a witness to any
statements.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Lisa Valente nodded crisply, &quot;I&#39;ll meet you
inside.&quot;

Nene turned and strode inside, the graying officer
following the far too familiar route to Emergency.
&#39;I&#39;ve had way too many officers in here the last few
years,&#39; she thought bleakly. A nurse at the reception
desk questioned her presence so Nene flashed her
badge, wishing she was in uniform.

&quot;Sorry, ma&#39;am,&quot; the young woman flushed, &quot;I understand
that the shooting victim is over in ward C.&quot; She
dropped her voice to confide to Nene, &quot;There are
already several people there who say they&#39;re the
woman&#39;s friends.&quot;

&#39;Lovely,&#39; Nene thought, &#39;bystanders.&#39;

Quick steps brought the officer to ward C, a secure
section of the Emergency room used for victims in
dange of additional violence. A group of women stood
in the hall, clearly led by the tall, orange haired
woman standing to one side. A tearful brown haired
woman looked through the glass at the victim
worriedly, a pink haired woman standing nearby.

&quot;Arisugawa Juri?&quot; Nene blinked, recognizing her
instantly.

&quot;Nene,&quot; Juri nodded, not taking her eyes from where
doctors were busy working on their patient. Her face
was blank, utterly controlled, but a fire blazed in
her eyes as she said, &quot;It&#39;s Keiko, she was the one who
was shot.&quot;

There was a second of shock, Nene had met Keiko more
than once when she went to the Locket with the others,
then she firmly squashed the emotion. She had to be a
police officer now, stay objective and focused on the
job. &quot;Is she conscious?&quot; Nene asked, asctivating the
mini-recorder that was built into her uniform jacket.

&quot;No,&quot; May shook her head, not taking her eyes away
from Keiko, &quot;she hasn&#39;t regained consciousness since
she was brought in.&quot;

&quot;Who brought her in?&#39; Nene asked, hoping that there
might be a good witness to the shooting.

&quot;That would be me,&quot; the blionde haired woman said,
stepping from the shadows. Nene turned to look at her
then froze in surprise.

Nene knew about the Sailor Senshi, of course, everyone
in Megatokyo did. Legendary heroes for over fourty
years, unaging guardians of the city, they were the
subject of many discussions at AD Police. But knowing
about them and meeting one was an entirely different
thing.

Sailor Venus was grave as she said, &quot;I was in the
Bioware facility, trying to find information on the
recent break ins, when I heard a gunshot.&quot; She looked
frustrated as she continued, &quot;I found Keiko in a
computer room, a data-disk beside her but no sign of
the shooter.&quot;

&quot;Data disk?&quot; Nene pounced on that eagerly.

Sailor Venus produced the bagged object from a pouch
in her sailor fuku, &quot;I have only handled it with
gloves, fingerprints should be uncorrupted.&quot;

As Nene was holding out a plastic baggy for the disk
Lisa caught up with her, skidding to a stop as she
took in Sailor Venus. &quot;Wow,&quot; she managed weakly.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Nene sealed it up, sliding the disk away.

The door to the emergency suite opened, a redheaded
young man emerging. &quot;Doctor Saotome,&quot; Juri said to him
intently, &quot;is Keiko....&quot;

Dr, Saotome shook his head gravely, &quot;There&#39;s serious
internal injuries, bleeding in both the chest cavity
and lungs. Short of massive use of Boomeroid implants,
there&#39;s nothing I can do.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; May said weakly, tears streaming down her face.

&quot;Is Keiko awake?&quot; Nene had to ask.

&quot;She&#39;s conscious but very, very weak,&quot; he answered
them before pointedly looking at Nene, &quot;don&#39;t stress
her too much, please.&quot;

May lead the way inside, moving to Keiko&#39;s side. She
knelt down, taking Keiko&#39;s hand and squeezing it
gently. Keiko was pale, her long brown hair streaked
with gray, lines of pain around her eyes and mouth.
Tubes connected her to monitors and liquid feeds, her
gown still stained with red from the initial medical
probes. She looked over at May, her expression sad,
then Keiko quietly managed, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, love, I guess
I got overconfident.&quot;

Nene hated to interupt them, but she knew she had to.
&quot;Can you tell me what happened?&quot; she asked, praying
that Keiko had at least seen her killer.

&quot;I work for Bioware,&quot; Keiko managed,. &quot;one of their
Boomer researchers. We were handed files and data a
few days agio that seemed to have been stolen from
Re-genex, our main competetor.&quot;

Nene felt a sudden flash of pure annoyance. &#39;And they
didn&#39;t report it?&#39; she thought, but kept herself from
saying anything aloud.

&quot;I was trying to confirm if they stole the data or
merely bought stolen goods,&quot; Keiko whispered, &quot;but
what I found out was far worse than I thought.&quot; She
took a breath, wincing in pain, &quot;Bio-ware, along with
several other companies, intend to override Boomers
and force them to attack the city along with Mercenary
forces.&quot;

&quot;You can confirm this?&quot; Sailor Venus asked, her eyes
wide.

&quot;The data disk,&quot; Keiko answered, her eyes drooping,
&quot;everything I could find was downloaded on to it.&quot;

Nene slipped from the room, moving out into the
hallway as she got out her cellphone. &quot;Leon, it&#39;s
Nene,&quot; she said, &quot;we need to recall every AD Police
officer we can.&quot;

Leon stuttered a moment, surprised, then asked, &quot;Why,
exactly?&quot;

&quot;I still need to review all the data,&quot; Nene said
briskly, &quot;but if this is true there could be a city
wide boomer incident in the very near future.&quot;

There was some creative swearing then Leon said, &quot;Will
do, but get the data connfirmed as soon as possible.
We need to know when and where.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Nene nodded. Hanging up she she dialed fast,
waiting till it was picked up, &quot;Sylia, it&#39;s Nene.&quot; Not
waiting for a greeting she continued grimly, &quot;We need
a emergency meeting of the Knight Sabers as soon as
possible.&quot;</pre>
