<h1>Mecha Wars (part 25 of 26)</h1>

<a href="../crossover/mechawars-ch24.html">Back to Part 24</a><pre>        Antonia Stark just had to grin, looking down with a certain 
amount of pride at the newspaper display at the airport terminal. She 
and the others had helped make those headlines, after all! &#39;Genom 
Chairman Arrested.&#39; one banner headline read, &#39;Revolution in the 
Boardroom&#39; was on another, &#39;Knight Sabers Revealed&#39; and finally, &#39;Boomer 
recall!&#39; What had happened just a few short days ago was still leaving 
shockwaves across all of Megatokyo.

        &quot;Thanks for seeing us off, cousin,&quot; Biko smiled at her warmly, 
the tall, blue haired woman offering Tony her hand.

        &quot;It&#39;s the least I could do,&quot; Antonia shook it firmly. She smiled 
at Biko and Aiko, &quot;And I wanted to thank you both personally once 
again.&quot;

        &quot;Hey, we had a lot of fun,&quot; Aiko grinned. &quot;I&#39;d stick around to 
see the fall-out,&quot; the redhead sighed, &quot;but our families want us home.&quot;

        &quot;Sylia wanted to be here, too,&quot; Antonia shrugged wryly, &quot;but 
with everything that&#39;s been happening she&#39;s got her hands full.&quot;

        The final boarding call rang through the terminal and Biko 
smiled as she said, &quot;I think that&#39;s our flight.&quot; She reached out to put 
her hand on Tony&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Take care of yourself, and tell the others 
we wish them well.&quot;

        &quot;Good luck,&quot; Aiko agreed as they headed off, the pair walking 
onto the plane.

        Tony left the airport, leaning on her cane as she made her way 
outside where the car awaited. &quot;Everything okay?&quot; Mackie asked, his dark 
hair falling into his eyes.

        &quot;They&#39;re on their way safe and sound,&quot; Tony said as she climbed 
into the passenger side. She looked over at him curiously, &quot;Are you 
really qualified to drive this thing?&quot;

        &quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; Mackie chuckled as he slid them into traffic. He 
reported with a smile. &quot;By the way, we finally heard back from the AD 
Police.&quot;

        &quot;So are they going to try to arrest Sylia for being involved 
with the Knight Sabers?&quot; Tony asked, knowing from his smile that the 
news wasn&#39;t going to be bad.

        &quot;Nope,&quot; Mackie smiled wickedly, &quot;the District Attorney&#39;s office 
had decided that there are extenuating circumstances.&quot;

        &quot;Circumstances like the fact that the police botched the murger 
investigation of Dr. Stingray,&quot; Tony said grimly, &quot;and that an case 
against Sylia would bring all of that to light.&quot;

        &quot;And that Sylia is now one of the most powerful women in 
Megatokyo,&quot; Mackie added.

        &quot;You&#39;ve got that right,&quot; Tony nodded, rolling the window down a 
bit to enjoy the breeze.

        They drove on for a few minutes, then more seriously Mackie 
asked her, &quot;So what are you going to do now?&quot;

        &quot;Eh?&quot; Tony looked at him in surprise.

        &quot;I care for my sister a great deal,&quot; Mackie kept his eyes on the 
road, a faint blush to his cheeks, &quot;and I don&#39;t want to see Sylia hurt. 
If you plan to go back to America or something, tell her soon, don&#39;t let 
her get her hopes up.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not planning on going anywhere,&quot; Tony said firmly. She 
smiled at the young man, &quot;I love your sister very much, and I hope we&#39;ll 
be together from now on.&quot;

        &quot;Good,&quot; Mackie sighed in relief as they began to ascend the 
roadway built around Genom&#39;s tower, moving up to the corporate levels.

        Reaching the right level they both got out of the car, moving 
into the building itself. &quot;Well,&quot; Sylia looked up with a smile as they 
entered her office, &quot;how do I look?&quot; She got up out of her chair, 
turning to model the metalic gray business suit she was in.

        &quot;Marvelous,&quot; Tony murmured, not even looking at her suit. 
Instead, her gaze was totally focused on Sylia&#39;s face.

        There was a soft knock on the door, and Sylia&#39;s new secretary 
came in. She had short black hair, and wore large, round glasses that 
slid down her nose. &quot;Here&#39;s the documents you asked for, Ms. Stingray,&quot; 
Nako beamed. Sylia took them, and the girl left with a smile.

        &quot;So what happened to Madigan?&quot; Mackie asked curiously.

        &quot;Well, after I opened up Genom&#39;s files to the AD Police, they 
have a shopping list of charges to go after Quincy with,&quot; Sylia said, 
&quot;and Madigan has agreed to testify in exchange for clemency in her own 
court cases.&quot;

        &quot;Well, she did help him pull a lot of that stuff off,&quot; Mackie 
noted.

        &quot;And now the fun part begins,&quot; Sylia sighed, &quot;I have to clean 
out the rot in this company before I do anything else, and I could use 
some help.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere,&quot; Tony reassured her. She paused, &quot;I&#39;ve 
made the decision to move the Stark corporate headquarters here, from 
now on.&quot;

        &quot;Oh, Tony,&quot; Sylia hugged her, being careful not to knock her 
lover over. They held each other close for a moment while she softly 
said, &quot;I&#39;m so glad.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll be here,&quot; Mackie chuckled, &quot;and I think the others will 
back you up, too.&quot;

        &quot;They have their lives,&quot; Sylia reminded him while still 
encircled in Tony&#39;s arms, &quot;but I know they&#39;ll do all they can.&quot;

        In another part of the city, Linna felt her lips pulling into a 
smile as she saw her, waiting outside her office building once again. 
&quot;You know, people are going to talk,&quot; she offered as she walked to the 
woman leaning on the sports car.

        Reika Chang just grinned at her, &quot;Good, I don&#39;t mind the idea of 
people talking about us.&quot; She gave her an impish look, &quot;Wanna give them 
something to really talk about?&quot;

        Linna laughed softly, hugging Reika close to her. &quot;I&#39;m just glad 
that no one knows you&#39;re the singer Vision,&quot; she murmured into her ear, 
&quot;I think there&#39;s members of your fanclub that would kill to be me right 
about now.&quot;

        Reika opened the passenger door for her, then went around to the 
driver&#39;s side. &quot;Speaking of Vision..&quot; Reika trailed off.

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Linna asked, looking over at Reika worriedly.

        &quot;You know I&#39;ve been touring less often,&quot; Reika said as she 
started up the car, &quot;and I can record my albums where I want to.&quot; She 
looked over at Linna, &quot;Do you think you could help find a place for a 
mostly homeless singer?&quot;

        Linna hesitated, feeling a smile tugging on her lips again. &quot;Oh, 
I think I could find room in my apartment,&quot; she finally said.

        &quot;I know this is all been kind of sudden,&quot; Reika focused on the 
road, moving through the traffic, &quot;but this is all very serious to me.&quot;

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Linna agreed. She put her hand on Reika&#39;s on the 
wheel, &quot;This is all pretty new to me, but I want to explore this.&quot;

        &quot;You know I&#39;d love to help you explore,&quot; Reika gave her a 
dangerous smile as she dropped her voice down to a sexy purr.

        &quot;I&#39;m being serious,&quot; Linna slapped Reika&#39;s arm. She sat back in 
her seat, looking up at the car&#39;s roof, &quot;I think I love you.&quot;

        Reika froze looking over at her, then the screech of wheels 
reminded her to keep her eyes on the road. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Reika blushed, &quot;I&#39;ve 
just been trying to figure out how, exactly to say that!&quot;

        &quot;Good enough,&quot; Lina shifted over, putting her head on Reika&#39;s 
shoulder.

        &quot;So what are your friends the Angelic Layer Deus doing?&quot; Reika 
asked as they drove towards Linna&#39;s apartment building.

        Linna chuckled softly as she revealed, &quot;It seems that they&#39;re 
keeping the Saber Dolls. Sylia is putting them on a substantial 
retainer, to keep them available to back us up in case something else 
happens, which it probably will.&quot;

        &quot;So the Knight Sabers are continuing after all this,&quot; Reika said 
thoughtfully. She sat there a moment then smiled, &quot;Good.&quot;

        &quot;Good?&quot; Linna looked a bit surprised.

        &quot;Not that I really want to see you risking life and limb,&quot; Reika 
continued on, &quot;but in an odd way being a Knight Saber suits you. You 
wouldn&#39;t be you without it.&quot;

        &quot;Maybe so,&quot; Linna agreed as they pulled up in front of the 
apartment. She gave Reika a smile, &quot;Would you care to join me, tonight?&quot;

        &quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask,&quot; Reika laughed.</pre>
