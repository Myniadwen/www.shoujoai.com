<h1>Once Burned, Twice Shy (part 4 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/1burn2shy-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>        Yayoi Mitsuri looked at the crime scene around her calmly, 
trying to focus her concentration on the job that lay ahead of her. This 
murder smelled all wrong, somehow, things just weren&#39;t adding up. It was 
almost like an assassination, but without any apparent motive, no reason 
to kill the target. She firmly hoped that the background checks would 
come up with something useful, but she wasn&#39;t holding out much hope.

        Yayoi looked up, her dark hair flowing wetly down her back as 
she snuck a glance at the dark purple haired woman sitting in the 
unmarked police cruiser. Having Motoko Kusanagi here was such an odd 
experience, one that she was still trying to figure out. She worked for 
Section Nine, Yayoi had heard, doing the sort of jobs the government 
rarely admitted they needed done.

        &#39;So why is someone like her out here?&#39; Yayoi frowned. The 
political connection was an obvious explanation, but it was almost too 
obvious. &#39;Of course I could always be over thinking this,&#39; she admitted 
to herself.

        There was a movement by the cruiser, and Yayoi was surprised to 
see Motoko stuck her head out of the car window and yell, &quot;Hey, Yayoi! 
Get over here!&quot;

        Yayoi made her way to the cruiser with a quizzical look on her 
face. &quot;Yes?&quot; she asked, looking down at Motoko curiously.

        &quot;There&#39;s a new complication to this case,&quot; Motoko said to her 
simply, directing Yayoi&#39;s attention to the cruiser&#39;s viewscreen.

        Yayoi saw the face on the viewscreen and recognized the white 
haired, nearly bald older man almost instantly, &#39;That&#39;s Aramaki, the 
head of Section Nine!&#39; She stiffened and crisply said, &quot;Sir!&quot;

        &quot;Two additional murders,&quot; Aramaki said to simply, &quot;apparently 
taking place at the same time and using identical methods.&quot;

        Yayoi&#39;s thoughts raced as she absorbed that information, 
slotting it in with what she had seen here. &quot;We&#39;re not just dealing with 
a murder,&quot; she finally said gravely, &quot;or at least not murder alone. 
Conspiracy, at least, or...&quot;

        &quot;... or a puppet master,&quot; Motoko added grimly.

        &#39;Puppet master?&#39; Yayoi blinked, filing that information away. 
She looked over at Aramaki&#39;s face and mustered up her courage to ask 
him, &quot;Was there any mention of something called &#39;the Wired&#39; with the 
other incidents?&quot;

        &quot;The Wired is coming,&quot; Aramaki calmly quoted, &quot;was attached to 
the messages we received for the other two murders.&quot;

        Motoko frowned thoughtfully. &quot;I helped one of the crime scene 
techs find what looked like a data-disk,&quot; she said, &quot;was anything 
similar found at the other locations?&quot;

        &#39;Where did she...?&#39; Yayoi felt a sudden flash of irritation and 
quickly quelled it. If Motoko had helped them find something it was a 
good thing, no matter how much her gut might think it was just 
interfering with her case.

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Aramaki nodded, &quot;we&#39;ve got two of the disks with our 
analysis teams, but they&#39;re well encrypted. We&#39;ll need time to crack 
that.&quot;

        Yayoi hesitated before reluctantly asking, &quot;Do you think you&#39;ll 
need the third disk to assist with the decoding?&quot;

        &quot;It would probably help,&quot; Motoko said dryly.

        Yayoi gave Aramaki and Motoko a grim look, &quot;I really hate the 
idea of handing any of the evidence over to you, especially if we ever 
have to prosecute whoever did this. It seriously screws with the chain 
of possession.&quot;

        &quot;But?&quot; Aramaki prompted her.

        &quot;You&#39;ve got better equipment and staff to analyze the disk,&quot; 
Yayoi said dryly, &quot;I&#39;ll authorize the disk to be released to you.&quot; She 
looked at Motoko, &quot;Can you sent that big monkey over to the police lab, 
I&#39;ll tell them he&#39;s coming?&quot;

        &quot;Batou,&quot; Motoko provided the name with a little smile even as 
she connected to him cybernetically. &#39;Batou?&#39; she visualized him.

        &#39;Yeah, Major?&#39; Batou answered.

        &#39;Swing by the police crime lab,&#39; Motoko ordered, &#39;they have a 
data- disk waiting for you to pick up. It&#39;s tied to this assassination 
investigation.&#39;

        &#39;Got it,&#39; Batou replied and disconnected.

        &quot;That&#39;s oddly eerie,&quot; Yayoi noted quietly. She looked over at 
Aramaki, &quot;I&#39;d like to be kept in the loop on this investigation, despite 
the work being done by your people.&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t object,&quot; Aramaki said before looking at Motoko, 
&quot;Major?&quot;

        Motoko gave Yayoi a thoughtful look before she said, &quot;I don&#39;t 
have a problem with that.&quot;

        &quot;Good. Let me know when you have some progress to report,&quot; 
Aramaki said before disconnecting, his expression already focused on his 
next task.

        &quot;Where to?&quot; Yayoi asked as she went around to the passenger side 
and climbed in.

        &quot;The main analysis lab,&quot; Motoko said crisply as she started up 
the unmarked cruiser, &quot;the disk should be there in a few moments.&quot;

        They rode silently, Yayoi occasionally looking over to study the 
intense woman&#39;s profile. &quot;What was your boss so concerned about?&quot; she 
finally asked.

        Motoko smiled slightly, restrained humor twinkling in her dark 
eyes. &quot;Right now,&quot; she smiled wryly, &quot;he&#39;s probably fielding calls from 
every nervous minister concerned that they&#39;re going to be the next 
target.&quot; She sighed softly, &quot;It&#39;s one of the reason&#39;s I&#39;ve never wanted 
to advance that high, dealing with that sort of thing.&quot;

        Yayoi nodded slightly, a slight smile on her face. &quot;No, you were 
never much interested in promotion,&quot; she agreed, &quot;just nailing the bad 
guys. Does Section Nine let you do that?&quot;

        &quot;More often than not,&quot; Motoko said noncommittally. She looked 
over at Yayoi, &quot;I noticed you haven&#39;t continued your cyberization. Why?&quot;

        Yayoi hesitated, trying to find the best way of putting it. &quot;I 
haven&#39;t become a convert to the &#39;Humanity First&#39; group or something like 
that,&quot; Yayoi smiled slightly, &quot;but I did remember our little run in with 
that &#39;Wired&#39; nutcase. I don&#39;t know if becoming a full cyborg did that to 
him or if he was crazy to start with... but I didn&#39;t want to find out.&quot;

        &quot;Fair enough,&quot; Motoko agreed, the tone of her voice neither 
approving or disapproving. They pulled in front of a nondescript 
government building, &quot;We&#39;re here.&quot;

        &quot;Not quite what I was expecting,&quot; Yayoi blinked up at the plain 
building in surprise. Not that she was sure what she thought it would 
be, but this wasn&#39;t it.

        &quot;Section Nine tries to keep a low profile,&quot; Motoko said dryly.

        The keycard that Motoko used opened the main doors, revealing a 
simple front room. They walked through, the Major nodding her greetings 
to the others as they went on through. &quot;There doesn&#39;t seem to be any 
women here,&quot; Yayoi noted.

        Motoko&#39;s expression was oddly remote as she said, &quot;I learned my 
lesson. I&#39;m very careful to keep myself out of temptation.&quot;

        Yayoi blinked in honest surprise as Motoko sat down at one of 
the desks. &#39;No women here at all? She did all that because we...&#39; she 
thought, feeling profoundly shaken.

        &quot;Looks like we&#39;ve got something,&quot; Motoko said as she opened up a 
series of files. &quot;The three disks each contained fragments of a 
message.&quot;

        The screen showed a burst of snow first, then a figure that was 
oddly familiar to them both. The man looked casual, the wind gently 
ruffling his gray hair, an odd smile visible on his face as he looked at 
them. Something about him, his stance, the way that he moved, told 
Motoko that he was fully cybernetic, with little or no parts of his 
human body left.

        &quot;He&#39;s dead,&quot; Yayoi whispered, &quot;I saw the body myself.&quot; The 
shooter from years ago, the assassin who had sought to kill Gretchen 
Phillips for her anti-cybernetics stance, stared out at them from the 
screen.

        &quot;The Wired is coming,&quot; he said to them with that same unnerving 
serenity, &quot;our goddess is awakening from her long rest. Lain is coming. 
Embrace the Wired or be destroyed, there are no other options.&quot; With 
that, the image was simply gone.

        &quot;Artificially created image, maybe,&quot; Motoko said grimly, &quot;or 
maybe... something else. Whoever it is, we still don&#39;t know what they 
want.&quot;

        &quot;Lain...&quot; Yayoi frowned, trying to recall something. &quot;Lain of 
the Wired...&quot;

        &quot;You know something?&quot; Motoko looked up at her from her seat.

        &quot;Something I read, once,&quot; Yayoi mused. &quot;Lain is a legend in 
cyberdive circles, she supposedly could go anywhere, do almost 
anything,&quot; she paused, &quot;if she was even real.&quot;

        &quot;If she is coming back,&quot; Motoko said grimly, &quot;then we could all 
be in trouble.&quot;</pre>
