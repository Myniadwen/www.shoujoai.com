<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 5 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/supergirl-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre> A-ko and B-ko looked up in awe at the silver skinned figure floating 
above the ruptured reactor core, soaking up the spilling radiation like 
a living sponge. &quot;If you could shut down the core, I&#39;d appreciate it,&quot; 
Captain Atom smiled down at them.

&quot;Right,&quot; B-ko leapt into action, using her suit to interface with the 
control panel, overriding the regular systems to speed up the shutdown.

A-ko lifted the damaged sections of casing back into place, then decided 
to try a new trick she had been working on. She focused her 
concentration, gazed intently at the alloy, and it began to melt 
together, resealing the outer wall.

Once she was finished, A-ko rubbed at her eyes, &quot;That still gives me a 
headache.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for your help,&quot; the silver skinned man smiled. Captain Atom&#39;s 
eyes glowed golden, his silvery skin reflecting the artificial light.

&quot;So,&quot; B-ko asked curiously, &quot;are you the second or third Captain Atom?&quot;

&quot;Steel!&quot; A-ko chided her.

&quot;Still the first, actually,&quot; Captain Atom smiled ruefully.

&quot;What?&quot; B-ko looked at him in surprise.

&quot;The alien alloy making up my skin slows my aging process,&quot; the Captain 
shrugged. He waved cheerfully, &quot;See you around.&quot; He flew off, leaving a 
burst of energy in his wake.

&quot;Wow,&quot; A-ko said softly, and B-ko nodded her agreement.

Many of the world&#39;s heroes had begun to reapear in public after 
Supergirl&#39;s and Steel&#39;s debut, but along with them a old problem had 
also returned. All the supervillains were also coming back, and with a 
vengence!

&quot;So who cracked the reactor open?&quot; Oracle asked them curiously after the 
pair teleported back up to the Watchtower.

&quot;He called himself Tokomak,&quot; B-ko sighed, &quot;and I swear he single 
handedly gave battle armor a bad name.&quot;

&quot;Do you want me to help you remove your armor?&quot; D-ko asked. The blonde 
robot almost always stayed up in the Watchtower now, if only to keep 
Oracle company.

&quot;I&#39;ll leave it on for now,&quot; B-ko said, &quot;but thanks.&quot; D-ko blushed, 
smiling.

&#39;Interesting,&#39; A-ko thought, &#39;very interesting.&#39; Aloud, she reported, 
&quot;And he was so badly overweight it was rediculous.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t help that he kept yelling for Firestorm to have a rematch with 
him,&quot; B-ko made a face. &quot;Still, we handled him nicely,&quot; she reported.

&quot;But it could have gone the other way,&quot; a cool voice noted.

They all turned, scanning the room for whomever had spoken. &quot;My sensors 
didn&#39;t detect any intruders,&quot; Oracle started, a fierce expression on her 
face.

He stepped out of the shadows, a long black cape fluttering around him. 
A black mask hid his eyes, and a blue bodysuit fit him snugly. &quot;Hello 
Oracle,&quot; he smiled, &quot;it&#39;s been a while.&quot;

&quot;Who are you,&quot; B-ko leveled her arm cannon at him, &quot;and what are you 
doing here?&quot;

He looked at her calmly. &quot;Point that elsewhere, or I&#39;ll take it away 
from you,&quot; he said, no threat in his voice, just a simple statement of 
fact.

D-ko spoke up even as B-ko lowered her arm cannon, &quot;You&#39;ll have to go 
through me first.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s a friend,&quot; Oracle cautioned the two.

&quot;Nightwing,&quot; A-ko said softly, studying him intensely.

&quot;Very good,&quot; Nightwing gave her a nod. He reached up, pulling his mask 
away, and gave them a smile, &quot;My name&#39;s Tim Drake, nice to meet you.&quot;

&quot;What did you mean, it could have gone the other way?&quot; B-ko demanded.

&quot;B-ko,&quot; Tim smiled, &quot;you two make a good team. But despite your talents, 
there are crisis that only a team can handle.&quot;

&quot;How did you know who I am?&quot; B-ko demanded.

&quot;Because it&#39;s my business to know,&quot; Tim shrugged.

&quot;Are you suggesting we reform the Justice League?&quot; A-ko asked. She 
paused, &quot;And are you interested in being a member?&quot;

Tim surprised them with a soft laugh, &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m a bit old for that.&quot; 
He drew a disk from his costume, smoothly tossing it to B-ko. &quot;There&#39;s 
information on all the active superhuman&#39;s I&#39;m aware of on there,&quot; he 
smiled, &quot;plently of recruitment possibilities.&quot;

Before they could ask him anything more, he turned, walked a short way 
and was simply gone. B-ko ran forward, looking around wildly, &quot;How on 
Earth?&quot;

Oracle frowned, &quot;Batman used to do that, too.&quot; She went as still as a 
statue, her hologram fading as she devoted computer power to another 
problem. Suddenly, her hologram firmed up and she began to swear, 
vigorously.

&quot;What?&quot; A-ko asked her worriedly.

&quot;He hacked the teleporters,&quot; Oracle growled. &quot;I&#39;m setting up new 
firewalls,&quot; she reported, &quot;but I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;ll keep him out.&quot;

&quot;Is he that good of a hacker?&quot; D-ko asked worriedly. Anybody that good 
was a major concern, in her eyes.

&quot;He was almost as good as I was in the old days,&quot; Oracle admitted.

&quot;Do you trust him?&quot; B-ko asked her quietly.

Oracle nodded, &quot;At one time, I&#39;d have trusted him with my life.&quot;

&quot;Good enough for me,&quot; A-ko nodded. She looked out one of the windows at 
the Moon&#39;s surface, &quot;What do you think of his idea?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t like him much,&quot; B-ko admitted, &quot;but it&#39;s not a bad idea.&quot;

&quot;Oracle?&quot; A-ko asked.

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m a former JLAer,&quot; Oracle shrugged, &quot;I&#39;m sort of automatically 
for it.&quot;

&quot;I guess so,&quot; A-ko laughed softly. She paused, &quot;D-ko?&quot;

&quot;Me?&quot; the robot asked, surprised. She hesitated, &quot;I think... it&#39;s a good 
idea. It improves your odds for success,&quot;

&quot;Looks like we&#39;re all in agreement,&quot; A-ko said with a grin.</pre>
