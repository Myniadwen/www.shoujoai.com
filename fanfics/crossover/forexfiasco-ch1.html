<h1>Foreign Exchange Fiasco (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Warning: I wrote this story to cheer myself up after reading one too 
many angst-filled, tear-jerker Sailor Moon stories. So fair warning: 
this is not Masterpiece Theater; it is an incredibly silly story, more 
along the lines of a Mad Magazine spoof than anything else. Enjoy. 

------ 

The six friends and fellow Senshi sat around the table drinking sodas 
and eating the pizza in front of them. Hotaru&#39;s fifteenth birthday party 
was a big event, but unfortunately while both her mamas and her 
Haruka-papa were there, most of the Inner Senshi had prior engagements. 
That didn&#39;t stop the birthday girl from having just as much fun with 
only Usagi and Ami around, however. While Usagi was great for comic 
relief, Hotaru found she liked spending time with Ami for different 
reasons. She was also shy, and had to be coaxed a bit to open up, just 
like her. 

After the day at the park, they&#39;d come here to unwind. Over dinner, Ami 
had talked about the foreign exchange student from America she and her 
mother had played host to. She laughed as she talked about the cultural 
differences, the hard time communicating at first, and the tearful 
goodbyes at the airport. Setsuna spoke up. 

&quot;Wow, it sounds like you and your mom had a wonderful time.&quot; she said 
wistfully. Ami smiled. 

&quot;We did. We still keep in touch with her too via e-mail. I think we were 
both enriched by the experience.&quot; 

&quot;You know,&quot; Michiru chimed in, &quot;We have a pretty big place, and...&quot; 

&quot;Whoa, wait just one minute.&quot; Haruka interrupted, &quot;If you&#39;re thinking 
of...&quot; 

&quot;Well, why not?&quot; her aqua-haired partner asked. 

&quot;Why not? Haven&#39;t you ever heard what kind of people come from America?&quot; 

&quot;Haruka!&quot; Ami cried, &quot;That&#39;s hardly fair, not all Americans are rude or 
obnoxious. That&#39;s just a stereotype.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah papa.&quot; Hotaru put in. Haruka raised her eyebrow at her daughter. 

&quot;Et tu firefly?&quot; she asked.  

&quot;Haruka, please.&quot; Setsuna said, &quot;They would never send a rude gaijin. 
Besides, think of all we could share; the music you and Michiru make, 
our wonderful friends,&quot; she said, indicating Ami and Usagi, &quot;And the 
warmth we share as a family.&quot; 

Usagi nodded her head, &quot;Haruka, you have a loving, wonderful family. 
Just sitting across from you, I can feel how much you all care deeply 
for one another. This would give you all a chance to share that with a 
new friend or two from the states.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, Haruka-papa, it&#39;ll be fun. Pleeease?&quot; Hotaru asked, giving Haruka 
Tenoh &quot;The Look.&quot; She was almost certain her adopted daughter learned it 
from observing her Michiru-mama. 

&quot;(sigh) Very well, we&#39;ll look into it tomorrow. But no promises.&quot; she 
admonished as all the others at the table cheered her decision. 

---Meanwhile--- 

It was a tense meeting in the teacher&#39;s lounge at Highland High. All the 
teachers looked around conspiratorially as they waited for Principle 
McVicker to arrive. Finally, he opened the door and entered. 

&quot;Uuuh... Uuuh... I called you all in here today because of those two 
bastards!&quot; he said, shaking all over as he talked. &quot;Uuuh... I think I&#39;ve 
got a way to get rid of Beavis and B-B-B-Buthead for good.&quot; 

&quot;Mui bien.&quot; the Spanish teacher said with a smile. 

&quot;If you&#39;d just let me kill them back when I first offered...&quot; Mr. 
Buzzcut put in. 

&quot;Violence is not the answer.&quot; Mr. Van Driessen put in. 

&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; McVicker yelled. &quot;Uuuh... Uuuh... Now listen; the school 
board wants us to recommend two students for a foreign exchange program 
over in Japan. 

&quot;What?&quot; Van Driessen asked in bewilderment, &quot;Beavis and Butthead?&quot; 

&quot;No way!&quot; Mr. Buzzcut said, &quot;Those two idiots can barely speak English, 
let alone be capable of learning Japanese. Besides, they&#39;d never go. 
They don&#39;t serve nachos in Japan.&quot; 

&quot;Uuuh... I already thought of that, uuuh...&quot; he said with a smile. 

Two hours later, the delinquents in question found themselves in a room 
filled with anime tapes, violent porn mangas, Godzilla movies and 
posters of hot Asian girls. On the TV in front of them, a samurai was 
slicing someone&#39;s arm off as his young son watched on from a baby cart. 

&quot;Whoah.&quot; Butthead uttered. &quot;Did you see that?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, yeah! Blood!&quot; Beavis answered. 

Uuuh... Uuuh... You see? Uuuh... Isn&#39;t Japan the coolest place ever?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Butthead agreed, &quot;They got samurais that flip out and kill 
people, and chicks with big boobs.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, yeah. He He, and giant monsters that breathe fire! Fire! Fire!&quot; 

&quot;Uuuh... How would you boys like to go there?&quot; 

&quot;Whoa, really?&quot; Bevis asked excitedly. 

&quot;We&#39;re there, dude.&quot; Butthead joined in. 

---Two Weeks Later--- 

Michiru and Setsuna stood restlessly by the gate at the airport waiting 
for their visitors to arrive. While they had the school photos provided 
them to recognize their two new charges, they also held up signs with 
their names on them. 

Setsuna noted the look of concern on Michiru&#39;s lovely face and put an 
understanding hand on her shoulder. 

&quot;Anxious?&quot; she asked. The woman with the aqua locks nodded.  

&quot;I wish Haruka was here as well.&quot; she confided. 

&quot;I know, but you know that she has to race today to qualify for the 
championships.&quot; 

&quot;Of course I know, I... Oh look, they&#39;re letting the passengers off.&quot; 
she said excitedly. 

A large group of men, women and children got off the plane, before two 
very irate stewardesses came off, each carrying someone in a headlock. 
They then tossed the two to the floor, and went back on the plane. 
Setsuna and Michiru looked again at the photos, then back at the two 
delinquents in front of them, and sweat dropped. They both slowly walked 
over. 

&quot;Uh, hey Beavis, check out those two chicks.&quot; Butthead said, just before 
noticing the signs. &quot;Uh... Words... Uh...&quot; 

&quot;Beavis-san?&quot; Setsuna asked, looking at the blond who was getting up off 
the floor. His eyes immediately bulged out. 

&quot;Whoa, dude she wants me!&quot; Beavis exclaimed as he looked excitedly at 
the woman in the short skirt before him with the long dark green hair 
&quot;Boi-oi-oi-oing!&quot; Butthead was looking at the other one, the girl with 
the wavy hair. 

&quot;Uh... Hey baby.&quot; he said, smiling at her, &quot;Come to Butthead.&quot; </pre>
