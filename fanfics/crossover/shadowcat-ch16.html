<h1>Shadowcat: Read or Die! (part 16 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/shadowcat-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>Much later that day Amelia crouched low on a rooftop,
her brown hair blowing around her face as she watched
through her binoculars as Kitty left another of the
district&#39;s many bookstores, holding a book in her had.
She entered the press of traffic, moving through the
crowds... but didn&#39;t emerge from the other side.

&#39;What?&#39; Amelia felt a moment of panic that she quickly
quelled. Sweeping the crowd and the area beyond she
tried to reacquire her target, but after a few moments
realized that she had been given the slip. &#39;I&#39;m going
to have to report this,&#39; Amelia thought glumly.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Yukio-cat answered after a second.

&quot;I&#39;ve lost Pryde,&quot; Amelia confessed reluctantly, &quot;she
gave me the slip.&quot;

There was a harsh curse and then Yukio continued on,
&quot;Do you know how badly you&#39;ve just screwed up? Pryde
and Readman are our best shot at finding the secret
headquarters of the Great British Library!&quot;

Amelia felt a flash of anger, &quot;Don&#39;t you think I know
that!&quot; She forced herself to calm down, &quot;What do I do
know?&quot;

Yukio considered a moment, &quot;Come back to base, we&#39;ll
have to try picking up Pryde at the apartment or
Readman at her job and hope one of them slips.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Amelia sighed, signing off. She moved
out of line of sight of the street and let her wings
unfurl from her back, flowing out from under her
aviator&#39;s gear to stretch out to the sun. A single
beat of her wings sent her up, then another sent her
off...

... unaware that something had been gently tossed onto
her back.

Kitty Pryde grinned, crouching down as she watched the
other woman rise off, hopefully towards the Ijin
headquarters. The tracking device the dark brown
haired girl had tossed onto Amelia&#39;s back was powerful
but hopefully hard to detect.

&#39;It looks like Drake&#39;s plan might just work,&#39; Kitty
admitted, thinking back to her visit to the library
earlier that day.



The Library facility was concealed, obviously, beneath
another library, but it was because of that obvious
element that people didn&#39;t seem to catch on. Not to
mention the fact that few people really knew about the
Library&#39;s existence or believed the few rumors
floating around.

&quot;Hey Kitty,&quot; one of the researchers called out a
greeting as she exited the hidden lift then David
continued, &quot;I got the information you asked for about
Nancy&#39;s European movements.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kitty smiled back, &quot;add it to Nancy&#39;s file
so I can review it later.&quot; She ran a hand through her
hair, &quot;Is Joker or Drake Anderson in?&quot;

&quot;Both, I think,&quot; he agreed. David tapped a few brass
knobbed controls on the oddly archaic computer that he
used, &quot;Drake is down at the targeting range and Joker
is in his office.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d best see Joker first,&quot; Kitty noted, &quot;thanks.&quot;

Wendy was typing away as Kitty reached the outer
office, the blonde looking up to smile at Kitty.
&quot;Welcome Miss Pryde,&quot; she beamed, &quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting
you today.&quot;

&#39;Could someone like this really be involved with the
creation of the Ijin?&#39; Kitty wondered, reflecting on
something the Silver Samurai had claimed.

&quot;Did you want to see Mr. Joker?&quot; Wendy continued
cheerfully.

&quot;Yes, please,&quot; Kitty nodded, &quot;and Drake, too.&quot; She
added, &quot;There may be a new development with the Ijin
situation.&quot;

Wendy spoke softly into the intercom on her desk then
looked up at Kitty, &quot;Go right in.&quot;

Joker smiled as he looked up from a desk covered by
paperwork and books of various types, &quot;Good afternoon,
Miss Pryde.&quot;

Kitty smiled back at the handsome blonde, dressed in a
fine suit that was just a bit dusty with the leavings
of books. &quot;Joker, it&#39;s good of you to see me so soon,&quot;
she continued without pausing, &quot;is the Library having
me tailed?&quot;

If Joker was surprised by the question he didn&#39;t show
it, &quot;No, we aren&#39;t.&quot; He raised an eyebrow, &quot;Are you
being followed?&quot;

&quot;I got lucky and spotted my tail this morning,&quot; Kitty
nodded seriously. She leaned forward, &quot;Is the Library
being monitored by anyone else?&quot;

&quot;Our rivals the Literary Mystic Society tend to sniff
around,&quot; Joker acknowledged, &quot;but we keep a good track
of their agents.&quot;

&quot;Which leaves one very interesting possibility,&quot; Kitty
smiled grimly.

&quot;You wanted to see me, Joker?&quot; Drake Anderson barged
inside a moment later, the burly blonde man nodding to
Kitty respectfully.

&quot;Miss Pryde called, actually,&quot; Joker sounded amused.

&quot;It looks like the Ijin may be tailing me, Yomiko and
possibly Drake,&quot; Kitty explained, &quot;now we need to
decide what to do about it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m being tailed?&quot; Drake blinked.

&quot;You and Yomiko helped thwart the Ijin last time,&quot;
Kitty shrugged, &quot;it seems reasonable to assume that
the current organization knows who you are, at least.&quot;

&quot;Hmph,&quot; Drake frowned, but seemed unable to argue.

&quot;You&#39;re assuming that Mr. Sinister had the ability to
monitor our first battle with the Ijin,&quot; Joker
frowned.

&quot;Sinister has access to very advanced technology,&quot;
Kitty said with a shrug, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t put it past him.&quot;

&quot;So why hasn&#39;t Sinister-san been able to find the
Library?&quot; Wendy asked, carrying a tray with tea and
biscuits inside.

Even as Kitty casually prevented Wendy from falling
and spilling everything Joker spoke up, &quot;It may be
that Mr. Gentleman has a means to prevent that.&quot;

&quot;Anyway,&quot; Kitty firmly got them all back on track, &quot;I
spotted my tail this morning, but whoever it is, it&#39;s
a professional. The only reason I&#39;ve caught a few
glimpses since then has been because I&#39;ve been looking
hard.&quot;

&quot;We could use this to our advantage,&quot; Drake said
thoughtfully.

&quot;How so?&quot; Wendy looked at him curiously.

&quot;First thing we could do would be to capture the tail
and pump him,&quot; Drake began.

&quot;Or her,&quot; Kitty reminded him.

&quot;Or her for information,&quot; Drake finished.

&quot;It&#39;s a possibility,&quot; Joker conceded, &quot;but I suspect
that Sinister would have prevented too much
information reaching his troops.&quot;

&quot;The other option would be to follow him or her back
to their hideout,&quot; Drake offered.

&quot;Use their own agent against them,&quot; Wendy blurted
excitedly.

&quot;It has possibilities,&quot; Joker conceded thoughtfully.

Kitty nodded, &quot;Let&#39;s see if we can figure out how to
do this...&quot;



&#39;Which brings me back to now,&#39; Kitty mused from her
place on the rooftop. She touched a microphone at her
throat, &quot;Drake, you getting the signal from the
tracer?&quot;

&quot;Loud and clear,&quot; Drake answered gruffly, &quot;looks like
the tech boys got it right.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s hope that it&#39;ll cut through any interference
around Sinister&#39;s headquarters,&quot; Kitty said, sounding
mildly pessimistic.

&quot;It&#39;ll work,&quot; Drake said firmly. His voice took on an
amused quality, &quot;Wendy&#39;s off to get Yomiko out of her
substitute job, in case this does pay off.&quot;

Kitty chuckled, &quot;Hope Yomiko isn&#39;t too annoyed by
that!&quot;</pre>
