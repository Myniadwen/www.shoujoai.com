<a href="../crossover/jetiendo-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>The military van pulled over, Ash and May where violently dragged to the 
kingdom of King Rage four soldiers dragging Ash and May behind Angelica 
and Paz. The hallway was full of porcelain, gold and portraits. The 
soldiers threw Ash and May at Angelica&#39;s feet and stomped off. 

Ash and May stood up. After all the cruelty they have suffered waiting 
at the staircase was his majesty himself. 

King Rage with Ila on his left stared at his son looking at all the 
similarities between them both. 

&quot;My son&quot; the king cried &quot; welcome back to Jetiendo. I apologise for you 
to find out this way however. I&#39;m glad too see you unharmed&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s ok&quot; Ash shyly said &quot;dad&quot; then Rage turned his attention on to 
May 

&quot; Who is this charming lady?&quot; Rage asked 

&quot; My girl friend&quot; Ash replied &quot;May&quot; 

&quot; May&quot; Rage replied &quot;what a lovely name&quot; then changing the subject &quot;my 
maids will take you to your room. We&#39;ll meet at dinner have a proper 
chat. 

Angelica smirked evilly as she sent a horrible letter to her ex sister 
in law, then ran away Paz following her in a wild goose chase. 

Tasha, Gary, nana, Shyst and Garnet where all sitting on a pillar in the 
tropical obsidian forest as Angelica rushed to her religious niece 

&quot; MOM&quot; Garnet cried as he hugged Angelica. 

&quot; The King invites you all to his castle&quot; Angelica said &quot; someone whom 
he wants you all to meet&quot; 

&quot;Who is it&quot; Tasha asked 

&quot; Wait and see&quot; Angelica answered &quot; he wants it as a surprise for now&quot; 

&quot; Of course we&#39;ll come&quot; Garnet said hastily. 

&quot;Ok then&quot; Angelica hissed &quot; see you all tonight&quot;
