<a href="../crossover/shadowcat-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>&quot;Yukio!&quot; Amelia cried, racing to the fallen catgirl&#39;s
side. Kneeling down beside her she was glad to feel a
pulse in her neck, the black furred woman merely
stunned by &#39;Ogun&#39;s strike.

&quot;Keep it down, would you?&quot; Yukio groaned as her eyes
fluttered open. After a moment memory rushed back and
she sat up, yelping in pain as she growled, &quot;Where&#39;s
&#39;Ogun?!&quot;

&quot;Pryde&#39;s handling him,&quot; Amelia said, her brown hair
and wings making it a bit awkward to help the other
woman up.

&quot;Oh boy,&quot; Yukio blinked, watching the fight in awe.

With near superhuman speed &#39;Ogun slashed at Kitty,
finger-blades extended but Kitty dodged gracefully,
kicking out even as she leapt. The red clad &#39;Ogun
grinned, phasing clear then pulled her claws back,
taking up a simple combat pose.

Kitty took up a matching pose, circling as she studied
the blood red clad woman thoughtfully. &quot;So how did you
hook up with someone like Sinister?&quot; she asked her
curiously.

&quot;That pup Sabertooth,&quot; &#39;Ogun smiled slightly, &quot;I
sought him out as a possible host but he was
hopelessly unfit. Still, while rummaging through his
memory I learned of Sinister and his clones.&quot;

Kitty circled warily, studying her dark twin. &quot;Why me,
exactly?&quot; She frowned, &quot;I&#39;d think trying to clone
Logan would be better.&quot;

&#39;Ogun laughed, leaping for her again. Swiftly Kitty
parried the shot on her forearm, wincing in pain as
the muscles spasmed under the strike, then barely
dodging the follow up attack to her head. Like a cat
&#39;Ogun landed smoothly then lashed out with a side
kick, slamming Kitty back.

&quot;Because from my perspective you have the greater
potential,&quot; &#39;Ogun purred with a dangerous smile,
&quot;there was always a limit on how far I could push
Logan. You soaked up all I could give you and
more....&quot;

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Kitty took up her stance again, wincing
a little as she wondered if &#39;Ogun had broken one of
her ribs.

Over to the side of the room Yomiko visibly fretted,
her long brown hair flowing over her shoulders as she
clutched thick sheets of paper in a white knuckled
grip. &quot;Drake,&quot; she said softly, &quot;we&#39;ve got to help
her!&quot;

Firmly Drake shook his head, &quot;No, not until Pryde
decides to ask.&quot;

&quot;But she&#39;s hurt,&quot; Yomiko protested.

&quot;And this is personal between them,&quot; Drake said
seriously. He paused a moment, &quot;But if &#39;Ogun seriously
looks like she&#39;s going to kill her, I&#39;m stepping in.&quot;

Yomiko broke into a smile, &quot;Me too.&quot;

&quot;You people are nuts, you know that?&quot; Amelia bitched
as she carried Yukio over, her wings pulled back in
for the moment.

&quot;It&#39;s a matter of honor between Prude and &#39;Ogun,&quot;
Yukio pointed out mildly. A pause, &quot;And you can put me
down now.&quot;

&quot;Then you&#39;re nuts, too,&quot; Amelia growled. She held
Yukio closer, if that was possible, &quot;And I will not
put you down, you&#39;re hurt.&quot;

Yukio sighed, &quot;Okay, whatever.&quot;

Kitty felt oddly excited as they fought, the younger
woman beginning to draw on all her training over the
years... and she had picked up a lot of it, fighting
against danger room drones, teammates and beside
various allies. She swiftly switched styles and
tactics, pulling on a variety of martial arts and
using them in unpredictable combinations.

&#39;Ogun seemed to enjoy the fight more and more, her
brown hair flowing as she moved with inhuman grace.
Everything that Kitty threw at her she handled easily,
a grin stretching across her face as she threw new
variations at Kitty. Back and forth they fought, each
trying to gain an advantage, but surprisingly they
were evenly matched.

&quot;I haven&#39;t enjoyed something this much in years,&quot;
&#39;Ogun purred, her eyes twinkling with amusement, &quot;my
faith in you has more than been rewarded.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Kitty raised her fists calmly.

&quot;Will you not take what I once offered?&quot; &#39;Ogun offered
a open hand, &quot;You would know immortality as your
spirit is joined with mine.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t make a very good Darth Vader, &#39;Ogun,&quot; Kitty
said with amusement.

It took a moment for &#39;Ogun to get the reference, then
she began to laugh. &quot;True enough,&quot; she conceded,
chuckling softly.

&quot;I won&#39;t give in to you &#39;Ogun,&quot; Kitty&#39;s voice was soft
in the near silence of the room, &quot;I&#39;d rather die
first.&quot;

&quot;Maybe, but the only way you&#39;ll stop me is to kill me
Pryde,&quot; &#39;Ogun said softly, lowering her arms to meet
Kitty&#39;s eyes, &quot;are you willing to do that?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s find out,&quot; Kitty moved like a shot.

&#39;Ogun jerked back as she dodged a strike to the face,
then Kitty dropped into a crouch. With well toned
muscles she leapt up and over the martial artist,
Kitty dropping behind &#39;Ogun gracefully. She spun
around and grabbed &#39;Ogun by the head, pausing only a
second.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Kitty said softly. With a sudden bunching
of muscles Kitty jerked her arms and &#39;Ogun&#39;s neck
broke with a sickening crack, Kitty&#39;s mirror twin
falling into a boneless heap to the ground at her
feet.

&quot;Oh my god....&quot; Yomiko murmured weakly.

From the body of Kitty&#39;s clone a red mist arose,
congealing in a moment to form a dignified Asian man,
dressed in red ninja garb. &#39;Ogun looked amused as his
voice echoed in their minds, &quot;This isn&#39;t over between
us, Pryde. I will have you, someday....&quot; With that he
seemed to disperse, swirling away into nothingness.

&quot;They always have to get in the last word,&quot; Drake
muttered.

Kitty tiredly walked over to the others, her eyes
haunted and body slumped with exhaustion. &quot;Is everyone
all right?&quot; she asked tiredly.

&quot;We&#39;re fine,&quot; Yomiko took Kitty&#39;s hands as she said
worriedly, &quot;you?&quot;

&quot;No, not after doing something like that,&quot; Kitty said
with a sigh.

&quot;If anyone deserved it, it was &#39;Ogun,&quot; Yukio pointed
out.

&quot;So what now?&quot; Amelia asked pointedly.

Drake flipped open his cellphone and dialed, &quot;Joker?&quot;
A pause, &quot;Yes, everyone&#39;s all right. We&#39;ve taken the
facility and &#39;Ogun and Sinister are dead, at least
temporarily.&quot;

&quot;Well?&quot; Yukio asked as he hung up.

Drake shrugged, &quot;We&#39;ve got a team coming out to secure
the building and recover any useful materials. Joker
and Mr. Gentleman will want us back for debriefing,
too.&quot;

&quot;Any chance of us seeing a doctor first?&quot; Kitty
visibly winced as she held a hand to her side, feeling
her ribs shift a bit.

&quot;Us, too,&quot; Amelia said pointedly.

&quot;Lets get the helicopter and head back,&quot; Yomiko said
as she held Kitty&#39;s arm, the group heading out
together.

Kitty quickly grabbed her laptop from where they had
dropped their gear, &quot;Better bring this with us, too. I
found some encrypted files while I was rooting around
in Sinister&#39;s mainframe, they might have some answers
for us.&quot;</pre>
