*****

Sakura was looking at something in her dresser for Tomoyo. She invited
her best friend to spend the night with her. Meanwhile Tomoyo was
making a dress for Sakura, and she was finishing it when Sakura came to
her.

&quot;I think this would be good for you Tomoyo-chan&quot; Sakura said as she
showed Tomoyo the cloth.

&quot;It&#39;s okay Sakura-chan, anything you give me is okay for me,&quot; Tomoyo
said smiling and Sakura blushed.

Sakura looked at the dress that Tomoyo made for her. It was like a
princess dress. Sakura smiled at the sight.

&quot;It&#39;s for the school representation, and for me? You think that I will
win the role of the princess for the representation?&quot; Sakura asked as
she gave Tomoyo the cloth.

&quot;Of course. You&#39;re beautiful and I&#39;m sure you will win the role,&quot;
Tomoyo said smiling.

&quot;Thanks, Tomoyo-chan. You&#39;re a great friend&quot; Sakura said smiling.

Tomoyo smiled at her best friend, but the smile turned into a sad one
for a short moment.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Sakura asked worried.

&quot;No, nothing&#39;s wrong. I&#39;m fine,&quot; Tomoyo said still smiling.

Sakura wasn&#39;t convinced.

&quot;Can you wear the dress, Sakura-chan?&quot; Tomoyo asked as she gave Sakura
the dress.

&quot;Sure&quot; Sakura said and she put on the dress.

&quot;Wow!!!! You&#39;re so beautiful Sakura-chan!!!&quot; Tomoyo exclaimed excited.

Sakura blushed at the compliment of her friend.

&quot;Thanks Tomoyo-chan&quot; Sakura said smiling.

&quot;You&#39;re the most beautiful princess I have ever seen,&quot; Tomoyo said
again with excitement.

Sakura blushed again.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan can we go to sleep now? I&#39;m tired and we must get up early
tomorrow,&quot; Sakura said as she changed herself.

&quot;Sure Sakura-chan&quot; Tomoyo said smiling.

Both girls crawled into the bed and Sakura was sleeping quickly. Tomoyo
looked at her with a sad smile and she kissed Sakura&#39;s forehead and
turned around.

&quot;Aishiteru, Sakura-chan&quot; Tomoyo said as she fell to sleep.

******

Sakura was standing in some place, behind her was Tomoyo. Sakura looked
at her cloth, and it was something like a costume. Something caught
Sakura&#39;s attention; in her breast pocket a white rose was there.
Suddenly rose petals and something like cards were floating in the air
surrounding both of them. Sakura looked to Tomoyo, she was wearing a
red dress that made look her like a princess. Suddenly, she arched her
back and a baton came out of her chest. Sakura looked surprised but
when she tried to get the baton the place faded away...

******

Sakura woke up and turned to see Tomoyo sleeping quietly. Sakura sighed
relieved at the sight of her best friend.

&quot;It was only a dream&quot; Sakura said relaxed.

&quot;Do you think that?&quot; a voice said.

Sakura quickly turned to see a person, a man who was wearing Chinese
clothes and golden glasses, dark long hair and having a smile.

Sakura was scared as she felt that the man was a spirit and she was
afraid of ghosts.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m here because I saw something in you&quot; said the man.

&quot;Something in me?&quot; Sakura asked quietly trying to not wake Tomoyo.

&quot;Yes, strength and nobility, a prince&#39;s qualities&quot; said the man.

&quot;I&#39;m not a prince, I&#39;m a girl and I want to become a princess for the
school&#39;s representation&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;It&#39;s true but you can become a prince as well,&quot; said the man smiling.

&quot;Why?&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;A prince has a noble task: protect the princesses in disgrace and
people from disaster&quot; the man said.

&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; said Sakura

&quot;You will understand. With time you will&quot; the man said.

Sakura was uncertain and the man looked to Tomoyo.

&quot;She&#39;s your friend right?&quot; the man asked.

&quot;Yes, she&#39;s my best friend&quot; Sakura said smiling.

&quot;She cares about you in a special way&quot; the man said.

&quot;In a special way?&quot; Sakura asked surprised.

&quot;Yes, you will find it with time.&quot; the man said.

Sakura looked puzzled.

&quot;She&#39;s the key...&quot; the man said.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;This girl is special, with time you will find it, she will give you
the reason you&#39;re looking for to become a prince,&quot; the man said.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan will give me the reason?&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;Yes&quot; the man said.

Sakura looked at Tomoyo and then she remembered the dream, she&#39;d seen
Tomoyo like a princess and then the sight of the baton coming out of
Tomoyo&#39;s chest made Sakura wonder about the dream.

&quot;The dream was...&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;It&#39;s time and I must go,&quot; the man said.

&quot;Wait... Will I see you again? The dream... Tomoyo-chan is...&quot; Sakura
said but the man smiled.

&quot;With time you will find it&quot; the man said.

&quot;If anything happens to Tomoyo-chan, I won&#39;t forgive myself,&quot; Sakura
said.

The man smiled again and came to Sakura.

&quot;Will you do anything for her?&quot; the man said.

&quot;Yes, anything to make her happy,&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;Even if she would suffer from that?&quot; the man asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t want her to suffer... I don&#39;t,&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;You have a noble purpose, a noble heart and power,&quot; the man said.

Sakura looked puzzled again.

&quot;Keep these noble qualities in your heart, in that way we will see
again,&quot; the man said.

&quot;I will,&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;I will a give you a reminder of this encounter; keep them,&quot; the man
said.

The man lift his hand, and from nowhere two things appeared. Sakura
looked at the things, it was a book and something like a card. Both
things placed on Sakura&#39;s hands.

Sakura looked to the card, it had the image of a woman and a name; &quot;The
Windy&quot;. Then she looked to the book, a lion was incrusted in the front
and a name was there; &quot;The Clow&quot;.

&quot;These things will lead you to me again,&quot; the man said smiling and
disappeared.

******

&quot;Sakura-chan...&quot;

&quot;Sakura-chan, please wake up. We must go to school,&quot; Tomoyo said trying
to wake her best friend.

Sakura opened her eyes and looked at Tomoyo, she smiled weakly.

&quot;It was just a dream...&quot; Sakura said sleepily.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Tomoyo asked puzzled

&quot;I had a dream, it was so strange, you looked like a princess...&quot;
Sakura said and Tomoyo smiled.

&quot;It&#39;s nice but you won&#39;t become the princess for the representation if
we don&#39;t go to school on time,&quot; Tomoyo said smiling.

&quot;Sure...&quot; Sakura said smiling and both left the room.

In the kitchen, Fujitaka and Touya were having breakfast when Sakura
and Tomoyo sat down.

&quot;Hi, dad and onii-chan,&quot; Sakura said smiling.

&quot;Hi, Fujitaka-san and Touya-san,&quot; Tomoyo said smiling as well.

&quot;The breakfast is ready&quot; Fujitaka said smiling.

Sakura and Tomoyo ate the breakfast, and after cleaning the dishes,
both were ready to go the school.

&quot;Onii-chan left so soon?&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;Yes, he said that will pick up Yukito&quot; Fujitaka told her.

&quot;Oh, I forgot my book!&quot; Sakura exclaimed as she checked her school bag.

&quot;And the dress!&quot; Tomoyo exclaimed as well.

Both went to Sakura&#39;s room to find the things, Sakura grabbed the book.

&quot;Sakura-chan...&quot; Tomoyo said.

&quot;Yes, Tomoyo-chan?&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;What are these things?&quot; Tomoyo asked.

Sakura looked and froze, over Tomoyo&#39;s dress, the book and the card
were there.

&quot;Can&#39;t be...&quot; Sakura said.

******
