<a href="../crossover/evatech-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>        Rei sighed to herself happily, the slim blue haired young woman 
luxuriating in the warmth of the shower, the force of the water scouring 
her body clean. She had thought the bell rang, the off in the distance 
Asuka called out, &quot;Rei? It&#39;s Asuka.&quot;

        &quot;Shit,&quot; Rei cursed under her breath, quickly shutting the water 
off and climbing out of the shower, &quot;I&#39;m late!&quot; Raising her voice she 
called back to Asuka, &quot;Come on in,&quot;

        Rei quickly dried herself as she listened to Asuka open the 
front door and walk inside. She saw Asuka step into the bedroom as she 
wrapped a towel around her body, smiling as Asuka&#39;s eyes visibly widened 
at the sight of her

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Rei said mildly, fighting back the pleasure she 
felt at Asuka&#39;s reaction, &quot;I&#39;m running a little behind.&quot;

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Asuka repeated, backing up so that she thumped up 
against the wall, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean... I didn&#39;t realize you were....&quot;

        Rei took a step forward, feeling the towel she was wearing slip 
down a bit as she gently said, &quot;It&#39;s all right, Asuka.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Asuka squeaked out.

        With a slightly impish smile Rei took pity on her, tugging her 
towel back up a bit as she said, &quot;I&#39;ll be ready to go in a moment.&quot; She 
went over to where a white dress lay on her bed, keeping her back to 
Asuka as she softly said, &quot;You look good in that.&quot;

        It hadn&#39;t startled her, exactly, when Asuka walked in, but her 
look had certainly Rei&#39;s breath away. The white button shirt and dark 
pants suited the beautiful pilot, giving her a boyish air while still 
highlighting all of her womanly charms. All in all Asuka looked lovely, 
so much so she found it a bit distracting.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Asuka managed to get out.

        Rei simply loosened the towel as she felt Asuka&#39;s eyes on her, 
letting the towel drop to the floor. She picked up a pair of lacy 
panties, bending over to pull it on and intentionally providing a lovely 
view of her rounded bottom. Then she lifted her dress from the bed, 
smoothly pulling it on over her head to let it gently settle down around 
her body.

        Rei reached around her back, trying to get her zipper pulled up 
but frowned, not quite able to reach it. &quot;Could you...&quot; she looked over 
her shoulder at Asuka warmly.

        &quot;Sure,&quot; the mildly pale Asuka said. She stepped close, carefully 
grabbing at the zipper and pulling it up, the scent she wore mingling 
with the soap and shampoo Rei had used. Asuka laid the tab down 
smoothly, and Rei shivered slightly as she patted her on the back 
gently.

        Rei turned back to her and smiled up at Asuka as she murmured, 
&quot;Thank you.&quot;

        Asuka cleared her throat, a bit of a blush to her cheeks. &quot;I was 
wondering,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;where you wanted to go?&quot;

        Rei tried not to looked too amused at the effect that she was 
having on Asuka. &quot;Do you have someplace in mind?&quot; she asked.

        Asuka smiled a bit sheepishly as she suggested, &quot;Little White 
Dragon?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Rei said. She sat down on the side of her bed, 
slipping white socks and her shoes on then getting up to take Asuka&#39;s 
arm. &quot;Shall we go?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;Lets,&quot; Asuka agreed.

        The two women walked through the crew section of the SDF-1, 
eventually climbing into a jeep to reach the city of Macross itself. Rei 
felt many eyes on them, taking them in as a couple and she felt a surge 
of pride. Asuka strode down the crowded street, her red-orange hair 
flowing around her shoulders. Rei stuck close to her side, holding on to 
Asuka&#39;s hand and smiling up at the taller woman.

        Asuka blushed slightly under the warmth of her gaze, the 
jostling of the crowd throwing them closer together. &quot;Are you all 
right?&quot; she asked, sheltering Rei with her arm.

        &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Rei sighed happily as she slid a bit closer to 
Asuka, &quot;thank you.&quot;

        Asuka kept her arm around Rei&#39;s shoulders as they started off 
again, entirely uncaring of the looks they were getting from the crowd. 
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Asuka murmured.

        The restaurant was busy as they two entered, some familiar faces 
nodding from many of the tables. Minmei&#39;s Aunt smiled as they came up to 
her, clearly delighted at seeing the two of them there together. 
&quot;Shinji, Minmei and their new friend went out already,&quot; she cheerfully 
relayed, &quot;but I hope you&#39;ll be staying for dinner.&quot;

        &quot;We were planning on it,&quot; Rei murmured softly.

        Asuka pushed her hair back one-handedly, keeping a grip on Rei 
as she said, &quot;Do you think we could have a corner table, somewhere 
private?&quot;

        &quot;Oh ho,&quot; the older woman smiled, eyes twinkling. She nodded 
firmly and said, &quot;I&#39;m sure I can find a spot for you two.&quot; A few moments 
later she was sitting the two down at a secluded corner table, lighting 
a candle that gave the area a soft glow.

        Asuka held Rei&#39;s chair for her in a curiously old fashioned 
gesture, one that brought a faintly pleased blush to her cheeks. Rei put 
her hand on Asuka&#39;s before she moved to go to her seat, looking up 
silently but with that warm little smile on her face.

        The older woman smiled as she watched Asuka settled into her own 
chair. &quot;So what can I get you this evening?&quot; she asked.

        Rei nodded to Asuka, &quot;You pick.&quot;

        Asuka flashed a smile, &quot;Right.&quot; She looked up at the lady beside 
their table and said, &quot;Two of the dinner specials, but could we have a 
bottle of wine and two glasses?&quot;

        &quot;Coming right up,&quot; with that the older woman was gone.

        Rei had the oddest little smile on her face as she put her chin 
on her hands, looking across at her warmly. &quot;I didn&#39;t know you were so 
romantic,&quot; she said softly.

        Asuka met her eyes, her own smile matching Rei&#39;s for warmth. 
&quot;Only with the right person,&quot; was her answer, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t do this for 
just anyone.&quot;

        Rei blushed slightly, feeling complimented by what Asuka had 
just said. &quot;And am I the right person?&quot; she asked quietly.

        Asuka reached across the table hesitantly, clearly unsure how 
the gesture might be received, and laid her hand over Rei&#39;s. &quot;I think 
so,&quot; she answered quietly.

        Rei squeezed that hand, touched by the gentleness she saw in 
Asuka&#39;s eyes. &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; she said softly. She studied Asuka a 
moment, finally venturing to ask, &quot;You&#39;re attracted to me, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

        Asuka&#39;s cheeks went a bright red. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d just 
ask like this,&quot; she muttered, looking down to hide her face.

        &quot;Are you?&quot; Rei repeated, tilting her head a bit to get a better 
look at Asuka&#39;s face.

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Asuka admitted, still blushing fiercely.

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Rei agreed softly.

        &quot;Your two dinner specials,&quot; Minmei&#39;s Aunt dropped the two plates 
off, clearly amused as the two pulled back a bit, &quot;wine and glasses.&quot; 
She beamed at the two women as she said, &quot;If you need anything else let 
me know and I hope you&#39;ll enjoy your meal.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Asuka smiled up at the older woman then looked over at 
Rei as she added quietly, &quot;I&#39;m sure that we will.&quot;

        &quot;Let&#39;s go to the karaoke bar first,&quot; Minmei said cheerfully, 
Shinji and Miriya walking beside the bouncy Chinese girl, &quot;then maybe 
we&#39;ll try the arcades.&quot;

        &quot;I should warn you that I don&#39;t sing very well,&quot; a smiling 
Shinji noted, his short black hair falling down into his eyes.

        &quot;That&#39;s half the fun,&quot; Minmei laughed, squeezing his hand.

        Miriya had that look on someone&#39;s face when they have no clue 
what&#39;s going on. &quot;Karaoke?&quot; the green haired woman asked.

        Shinji gave her a sympathetic look, clearly having bought into 
the amnesia story. &quot;It&#39;s kind of hard to explain,&quot; he said, &quot;we&#39;ll show 
you, okay?&quot;

        &#39;Ah ha!&#39; Miriya thought. &#39;Maybe this karaoke they mention is one 
of their military secrets? This could be a breakthrough,&#39; she mused 
excitedly.

        &quot;Here we are,&quot; Minmei said cheerfully, tugging them inside the 
modern building.

        Miriya studied her surroundings intently as they entered the 
booth, wondering what she might be dealing with. Two couches were on 
either side, a odd looking mechanical device sitting in the center of 
the room.

        Shinji passed the cans of sake he had picked up from one of the 
vending machines outside. &quot;You&#39;ll need some of this once I start 
singing,&quot; he said with a laugh.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Miriya blinked, after a moment&#39;s study popping open 
the tin. She took a hesitant drink, her eyes widening slightly, &quot;Whoo!&quot;

        &quot;So who gets to go first?&quot; Minmei beamed.

        &quot;You first,&quot; Shinji offered with a grin, &quot;that way Miriya can 
hear some good singing first.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Miriya agreed, curious to see what this singing 
and karaoke were.

        Minmei ran through the selection a moment then nodded 
cheerfully, &quot;Here&#39;s one!&quot; She hit the switch, soft music playing as she 
raised the mic. to her lips and sang, &quot;.... and heard her whisper out a 
name long forgiven, but not forgotten.&quot;

        Miriya felt her cheeks go red, emotions racing through her form 
as Minmei swayed, her voice washing over her. It was almost as if 
something old within her was awakening, touched by this strange sound, 
this singing. She leaned forward, eyes closed, and soaked it in.

        The final chorus rang out as Minmei finished, &quot;You&#39;re forgiven, 
not forgotten.&quot;

        &quot;That was good,&quot; Shinji murmured, looking over at Miriya and 
surprised to see the glitter of tears on her cheeks. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; he 
asked.

        Miriya blinked at him, then reached up to touch the tears as she 
looked at Minmei. &quot;I&#39;ve never...&quot; she trailed off, not knowing what to 
say.</pre>
