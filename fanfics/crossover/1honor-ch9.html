<h1>Conquest: One's Own Honor (part 9 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a>

<a href="../crossover/1honor-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>&quot;She&#39;s gone where&quot; Honor demanded, the brown haired
woman in a crisp captain&#39;s uniform glaring at the
officer whom had been assigned to keep an eye on
Ryouko.

&quot;She&#39;s gone down to the planet&quot; Tremaine answered, the
young man visibly pale under Honor&#39;s gaze&quot;I couldn&#39;t
stop her, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Marvelous&quot; Honor did her best not to curse, but it
took some effort.

&quot;Bleek&quot; Nimitz scolded her gently, the eight legged
treecat clinging to her shoulder.

They were orbiting a minor world bordering on Jurai&#146;s
sphere of influence, intending to try to open up a
dialog with the planet&#39;s rulers. Ryouko was realistic
enough to know that making allies against Jurai would
be wise, no matter which way things developed between
Manticore and Jurai.

Things went bad almost from the start, of course.
Despite much of the region being unclaimed space the
planetary government claimed the Manticore ships had
entered sovereign territory, then without warning they
had launched an attack on Honor&#39;s division of ships.
Fighting defensively Honor had held the line even as
Ryouko took Ryo-Ohki ahead to try and communicate with
the planetary government.

Obviously, it hadn&#39;t gone well.

&quot;What is a Jurai heavy cruiser doing here&quot; Honor
frowned, noting the ship that hung in orbit nearby
their own ships.

&quot;I think that&#39;s the root of the problem&quot; Tremaine
admitted&quot;it looks like they were here to negotiate
with them first.&quot;

&quot;And when the planetary government saw us coming they
panicked&quot; Honor realized. &quot;And Ryouko is...&quot;

&quot;Fighting, I believe&quot; one of the new officers spoke
up, Lieutenant Hunt&quot;she took a squad of Manticoran
marines down with her.&quot;

&quot;Hail the Empress&quot; Honor ordered.

Yuri nodded, the black haired young woman working her
controls. A moment later she reported&quot;Contact
established, ma&#39;am.&quot;

Ryouko appeared on the main screen, her long blue main
slightly messy and a few smudges on her cheeks. There
was a wild grin on her face as she said&quot;Too bad you
missed the start of the fun&quot;

Honor had to remind herself a officer did not scold
her commander in chief, no matter how much she wanted
to. Instead she asked&quot;What&#39;s your situation&quot;

Ryouko laughed&quot;I got tired of sitting up in orbit
watching things go crazy down here so I thought I&#39;d
take steps.&quot; She paused&quot;The civil guard, police and
military are all fighting for access to the few space
transports available, so things were getting a little
hairy for the citizens.&quot;

&quot;Understood&quot; Honor nodded&quot;but be aware there are Jurai
forces on the planet, too. I&#39;d really like to avoid
starting a war, if we can.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re already in a war&quot; Ryouko paused&quot;informally.&quot;
She turned her head, eyes narrowing before she
barked&quot;Got to go.&quot; With that the image was gone, space
swirling around them.

Honor had a bad feeling about this and ordered&quot;Hunt,
can you get a image of where Ryouko is down on the
surface&quot;

&quot;Aye aye&quot; Hunt answered, the image on the screen
changing as he used a combination of sensors to cut
through the atmosphere to the planet&#39;s surface... and
saw a pitched battle going on.

Ryouko was in the middle of the planetary forces, red
energy blade cutting down everyone who took a shot at
her. The Empress of Manticore fought like a warrior
born, dodging attacks then returning to defeat any who
dared oppose her. Then they saw another figure
fighting the planetary forces, leading a band of
figures through fighting until their paths finally
crossed.

&quot;Tell me that isn&#39;t who I think it is&quot; Honor sighed.

&quot;Sorry to say I can&#39;t do that&quot; Tremaine groaned
out&quot;that&#39;s Ayeka, the first Princess of the planet
Jurai.&quot;

Ayeka was dressed in formal diplomatic robes, now a
bit battered by her attempted flight from the world.
Long violet hair flowed down her back, her eyes a more
delicate shade of purple. The two women looked at each
other a moment then Ayeka ignited her own golden
energy blade and turned to face Ryouko in battle.

&quot;Washu is going to have kittens&quot; Honor murmured as
they watched them leap into battle.

&quot;Bleek&quot; Nimitz sounded amused.

Back and forth they fought, Ayeka surprisingly holding
her own against Ryouko&#39;s skills. It was hard to see
their faces but both almost looked like they were
enjoying the battle, testing each other&#39;s strengths
and weaknesses. Back and forth, relentlessly, then
suddenly the screen went white!

&quot;Orbital weapon&#39;s discharged&quot; Hunt reported grimly.

&quot;Target that cannon&quot; Honor barked&quot;then get me an image
of the surface back&quot;

Tremaine was at his weapons station, swiftly getting a
reading on the enemy weapon&#39;s platform. &quot;An antique
laser weapon&quot; he reported, firing their main batteries
to destroy the device. A single shot sent it swirling
away as a puddle of molten wreckage even as he
targeted and destroyed the rest for good measure.

&quot;Ryouko&quot; Honor asked crisply.

&quot;She&#39;s fine&quot; Hunt sighed in relief.

Honor looked to the screen then blinked in surprise at
the image there. Ryouko held the Princess Ayeka safely
in her arms, the two standing at the edge of the
crater the orbital weapon had created. They stood
there for a few moments, both of the women clearly a
little stunned by the turn that events had taken.

Then the battle caught up with them again, and they
were separated by the sudden crush of people. Ayeka
looked up from her band of diplomats, saw that Ryouko
was looking at her, and the warrior raised her blade
up in a grim salute to Ayeka. Gravely, Ayeka did the
same for Ryouko, and then they were gone.

&quot;I&#39;ll be damned&quot; Tremaine muttered softly.

&quot;Contact the planetary government&quot; Honor said
crisply&quot;or whatever is left of it. Tell them that if
they attempt deliberate regicide again we&#39;ll have to
bombard the planet from orbit.&quot; Honor felt the eyes of
her crew on her and smiled&quot;We know we don&#39;t do that
but considering Manticore&#39;s less than stellar
reputation they won&#39;t risk it.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am&quot; Yuri grinned.

&quot;Transport sphere&quot; Hunt reported&quot;heading for the Jurai
ship.&quot;

&quot;Looks like the princess and her people are leaving&quot;
Honor noted.

&quot;Should we try to...&quot; Tremaine asked.

&quot;No&quot; Honor was firm&quot;despite everything we&#39;re not at
war with Jurai.&quot; Mentally she added, &#39;Not yet,
anyway.&#39; Aloud she continued&quot;Get ready to receive
Ryo-Ohki, please.&quot;

It wasn&#39;t long before Ryouko was striding the halls of
the ship, Honor, Ryo-Ohki and Nimitz following. &quot;Who
was that young woman&quot; Ryouko asked, a thoughtful look
on her face.

&quot;You don&#39;t know&quot; Honor blinked in surprise.

&quot;Would I be asking if I did&quot; Ryouko sighed. She walked
a bit stiffly, her uniform a little battered but she
appeared unhurt from the conflict.

&quot;Sorry&quot; Honor smiled. &quot;She looks like the first
princess of Jurai, the Lady Ayeka, but I&#39;ll need to
run a visual match from records to be sure.&quot;

&quot;Ayeka, huh&quot; Ryouko murmured thoughtfully. They walked
along a few moments&quot;Have someone prepare a full
briefing on her for me.&quot;

&quot;Why&quot; Honor asked warily.

&quot;I think&quot; Ryouko answered calmly&quot;I have an idea.&quot;</pre>
