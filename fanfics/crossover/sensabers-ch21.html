<h1>Senshi Sabers (part 21 of 24)</h1>

<a href="../crossover/sensabers-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>Explosions lit up the night in a sullen red glare as
the Infinity lab burned, fires crackling along the
hallways as people screamed and died. Along the
hallways a figure walked, a slim young woman with
black hair who was nude as the day she was born.

Around the corner a security team came, armor gleaming
as they brought weapons up, rifles ready. But before
they could fire the woman gestured, eyes glowing
purple as the bio-boomers jerked, bodies twisting and
swelling amid their human handlers. With a painful
roar they turned on their comrades, striking with
inhuman strength as men screamed.

Striding through the blood and gore the woman smiled,
looking up at one of the few functioning security
cameras. &quot;Hello, sister,&quot; she smiled, her cold
expression making her look all the more chilling,
&quot;I&#39;ll see you soon.&quot;

Sitting in her office Hotaru Tomoe shuddered as she
looked at her twin&#39;s face then shut the monitor off.
Black hair fell into her violet eyes as she look at
her assistant and asked, &quot;What were our losses?&quot;

&quot;Fifty men killed,&quot; Kaori Knight replied quietly, &quot;and
the facility is a total loss.&quot; The redhead put the
papers down, &quot;I&#39;ve sent letters to the families, with
our deepest apologies.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t have to do that,&quot; Hotaru said quietly, &quot;I
would have...&quot;

Kaori smiled grimly, &quot;It&#39;s all right, ma&#39;am. I wanted
to do it.&quot;

Hotaru sat back, feeling tired. She had been woken
from a sound sleep as the first alarms went off,
hurrying in to headquarters only to find out that the
facility had been destroyed in less than a hour. AD
Police sealed off the building but only found mutated
bio-boomers, dead workers and purged computers. Only
one digital record survived in a sealed database,
planted there somehow by their enemy.

Hotaru frowned as she reviewed the record, &quot;And
Mistress Nine took nothing? She just destroyed the
facility for no reason?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re still reviewing inventories and logs,&quot; Kaori
said, &quot;but yes, it appears she went in, destroyed the
facility and left.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Hotaru shook her head grimly as she said,
&quot;there&#39;s one reason.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Kaori looked curious at her superior.

Hotaru gestured to the now dark computer screen as she
said flatly, &quot;She may have done this just to send me a
message.&quot;

&quot;I hope not, ma&#39;am,&quot; Kaori sighed softly.

Just then the intercom buzzed. &quot;Yes?&quot; Hotaru asked.

Outside her secretary nervously said, &quot;Ma&#39;am, the AD
Police are here to see you.&quot;

&quot;Send them in,&quot; Hotaru ordered. Looking up at Kaori
she smiled slightly, &quot;Could you stick around, please?&quot;

Of course,&quot; Kaori smiled reassuringly.

The two women who entered the office looked like near
physical opposites, the tall slim blonde and the
shorter, brown haired girl. Usagi Tsukino lead the
way, presenting her identification to Hotaru, followed
by Naru Osaka.

&quot;Ms. Tomoe,&quot; Usagi said briskly, &quot;thank you for
agreeing to see us so soon.&quot;

Hotaru gave a cool smile as she waved them to waiting
chairs, &quot;I&#39;m always eager to help the Police in their
investigations.&quot;

&quot;Nice change of pace,&quot; Naru murmured softly.

Kaori chuckled then covered it with a cough. &quot;Sorry,&quot;
she said, &quot;dry air.&quot;

Simply ignoring that comment Hotaru introduced Kaori,
then met Usagi&#39;s gaze calmly. &quot;How can we help you?&quot;
she asked.

&quot;As you can guess, we&#39;re investigating the attack on
your research facility,&quot; Usagi said, &quot;do you have any
idea of why it would be attacked?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re still examining files and taking inventory,&quot;
Hotaru admitted, &quot;but so far we haven&#39;t found
anything.&quot;

Naru leaned forward and asked, &quot;I understand there was
some security scans recovered?&quot;

&quot;Most of the cameras were destroyed,&quot; Kaoru said
smoothly.

Smoothly following that Hotaru said, &quot;But we did
recover a fragment.&quot;

Kaori nearly said something, but restrained herself.
&#39;What is Ms. Tomoe up to?&#39; she silently wondered.

Activating the monitor, Hotaru brought up the clip.
There was a burst of static then a face similar to
Hotaru&#39;s look up, &quot;I&#39;ll be seeing you soon.&quot;

Usagi made a note on her personal organizer, &quot;She
looks like you.&quot;

&quot;My father used some of my DNA in the creation of
certain bio-boomer prototypes,&quot; Hotaru cooly
explained, &quot;it may be she&#39;s one of them.&quot;

&quot;Do you have any information on her design?&quot; Naru
wondered, her expression plainly skeptical of what
Hotaru was saying.

&quot;Only partial data,&quot; Kaori interrupted smoothly, &quot;but
we&#39;ll forward that and any other relevant files to
you.&quot;

Usagi nodded, &quot;Thank you.&quot; She studied both
executives, &quot;There&#39;s always been rumors about the
&#39;planet&#39; series... super advanced Bio-boomers. This
woman wouldn&#39;t happen to be one, would she?&quot;

&#39;She&#39;s more informed than I thought,&#39; Hotaru mused,
mildly impressed. &quot;It&#39;s just a rumor, I assure you,&quot;
she said casually, &quot;if there really was an advanced
design, don&#39;t you think we&#39;d be selling them?&quot;

&quot;Thank you for your help,&quot; Usagi said formally as she
rose leaning on the desk a moment, Naru following.
&quot;We&#39;ll be contacting you to follow up soon.&quot;

Hotaru offered her hand, &quot;Sorry for the trouble.&quot;

&quot;No trouble,&quot; Usagi shook it firmly then she and Naru
left.

&quot;Ma&#39;am...&quot; Kaori started.

Hotaru waved her to silence as she went around her
desk to where Usagi had been sitting. Feeling under
the top of the desk where Usagi had put her hand just
moments before Hotaru produced a small electronic
device. &quot;Oh, someone must have misplaced this,&quot; she
said loudly before crunching it between her fingers.

&quot;A listening device?&quot; Kaori looked shocked.

&quot;Not unreasonable,&quot; Hotaru said as she sat back down,
&quot;considering my father&#39;s reputation I can&#39;t blame them
for being suspicious.&quot;

&quot;Is that even legal?&quot; Kaori wondered.

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t need to be,&quot; Hotaru shrugged as she sat
back down, &quot;as long as it provided them with some
leads.&quot; She sat back in her chair as she considered
the situation. &quot;I&#39;ve got new guidelines for our
security forces,&quot; she said briskly.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Kaori produced her notebook computer from her
suit pocket.

&quot;No one is to attempt to engage Mistress Nine,&quot; Hotaru
said, &quot;instead I want a priority call to me, day or
night. Also, all facilities are to be evacuated if
she&#39;s spotted.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t the last a bit excessive?&quot; Kaori asked
tentatively.

Hotaru shook her head, &quot;Frankly, we still know too
little about what she&#39;s capable of. I am not risking
any more employees until we have a handle on her.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Usagi paused in the car, both she and Naru listening
closely. &quot;Very clever,&quot; Usagi admitted as they
listened, &quot;you planting a second device.&quot;

Naru chuckled, &quot;Thank you.&quot; She paused, &quot;Ms Knight&#39;s
right, tho. We won&#39;t be able to use any of this as
evidence.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not looking for evidence,&quot; Usagi said with a
shrug, &quot;I&#39;m looking for leads.&quot;

They listened to the evacuation plans with raised
eyebrows. &quot;She&#39;s not cut from the same cloth as her
father,&quot; Naru noted.

&quot;She gave that thing a name,&quot; Usagi noted
interestedly, &quot;Mistress Nine. It looks like she DOES
know more than she&#39;s telling.&quot;

&quot;Not that a name tells us much,&quot; Naru noted cynically
as she added information to her notebook, &quot;but I&#39;ll do
a search on it, just in case.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Usagi said as she listened. &quot;Damn, they&#39;ve
stopped.&quot;

&quot;Sound like they&#39;ve left the office,&quot; Naru admitted.
&quot;The bug will keep sending for awhile, so if something
else comes up we&#39;ll get it.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Usagi set the system on record, &quot;let&#39;s
head back out to the factory. Maybe the forensics
people have found something.&quot;

&quot;And what do we do if the Senshi get involved?&quot; Naru
wondered as Usagi put the car into drive and pulled
away from Infinity.

&quot;We are still under orders to arrest them,&quot; Usagi
noted.

&quot;But...&quot; Naru heard it in her voice.

&quot;If we&#39;re still blocked,&quot; Usagi admitted, &quot;I might try
to see what they know, too.&quot;</pre>
