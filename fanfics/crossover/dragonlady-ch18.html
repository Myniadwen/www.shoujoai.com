<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/calamity.html">Calamity-Queen of Cordite</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/dragonlady-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>February 2010...

&quot;I am Supreme Commander Dolza,&quot; the large bald alien said. &quot;You will 
submit to my interrogation.&quot;

&quot;Wow, he speaks our language,&quot; Vicki said.

&quot;Amazing,&quot; Ranma agreed.

&quot;You! The male! Why have you attacked us?&quot; Dolza demanded.

&quot;Attacked you? What the hell are you talking about? You attacked us,&quot; 
Ranma said angrily.

&quot;Tell us what you know of Protoculture?&quot; demanded the smaller alien with 
the Marty Feldman eyes.

&quot;Huh? What&#39;s Protoculture?&quot; Ranma asked looking at Lisa.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Lisa said looking at the other two who looked just as 
baffled.

&quot;What the hell are you people talking about?&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;So you deny you&#39;ve made a secret weapon?&quot; Dolza asked.

&quot;Secret weapon? Look, we have no idea what you&#39;re talking...&quot; Ranma 
said, but Lisa interrupted him.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Ranma,&quot; she said. &quot;Look, we have no idea what you&#39;re talking 
about and I refuse to submit myself or my people to anymore of your 
questions.&quot;

&quot;So the female is in charge,&quot; Dolza said. &quot;Observe.&quot;

A holographic image appeared around them, depicting the area of space 
around an Earth-like planet. Hundreds of Zentradi ships took up orbit 
around the planet. Once all the ships were in position, they opened fire 
on the surface of the planet. Explosions blossomed and the atmosphere 
was filled with smoke and dust. It quickly settled, allowing the now 
dead, cratered surface of the planet to be seen.

&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Akane gasped.

&quot;Bloody hell,&quot; Vicki said in dismay.

&quot;Fucking barbaric savages,&quot; Ranma snarled, clenching his fists tightly.

&quot;So you see,&quot; Dolza said smugly. &quot;The Zentradi have more than enough 
power to destroy the SDF-1 and your people. You will answer our 
questions.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think you do,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;The SDF-1 is much more powerful than 
this bucket of bolts.&quot;

&quot;Are you bloody bonkers?&quot; Vicki gasped.

Dolza slammed his fist down on the table causing everyone but Ranma to 
fall down. Dolza reached out to grab Lisa. Seeing the huge hand heading 
toward his fianc&eacute;e, Ranma snapped. Just before the hand reached her, he 
attacked with a brutal kick to the hand. There was a snapping sound and 
Dolza howled in pain as his finger broke. The Supreme Commander swung 
his other fist down in a brutal blow that would leave Ranma a bloody 
smear on the table.

&quot;Ranma!&quot; Lisa screamed just before the fist hit.

Everyone stood still for a moment, unable to comprehend what they had 
just seen. Dolza had used his considerable might to crush the tiny 
human...but the tiny human wasn&#39;t crushed. Instead he had caught the 
fist and stopped it. Ranma grunted with effort as Dolza bore down 
harder.

&quot;Very well, Micronian,&quot; Dolza said. &quot;Your size belies your strength.&quot; 
Nobody was prepared when Dolza withdrew his fist and snatched up Akane. 
&quot;Now talk or the female dies. By what process do you become Micronians?&quot;

&quot;Become? We&#39;re born this way,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;Yes, but born from what?&quot; the Marty Feldman eyed alien asked.

&quot;Huh? Our mothers,&quot; Lisa said, confused.

&quot;What are &#39;mothers&#39;?&quot; the large Zentradi with the metal faceplate 
demanded.

&quot;You know, mothers, females,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;You mean you all come from females,&quot; the bug-eyed alien demanded. &quot;How 
is that possible?&quot;

&quot;Well, when a man and woman love each other, they have sex and sometimes 
the woman will get pregnant and have a baby, a little human which they 
take care of until it becomes an adult human,&quot; Vicki explained.

&quot;Sex? What is &#39;sex&#39;? You, male and you,&quot; Dolza pointed to Vicki. &quot;Show 
us,&quot; Dolza commanded.

&quot;But we can&#39;t,&quot; Vicki protested, trying to thing of a way out of this. 
&quot;The man and woman have to love each other.&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; the bug-eyes one said. &quot;The male and the other female 
then.&quot;

&quot;But we don&#39;t,&quot; Lisa started.

&quot;Love...&quot; Ranma added but trailed off when the image from earlier 
appeared around them and displayed a very clear recording of Ranma and 
Lisa professing their love for each other. The bug-eyed alien sat back, 
looking smug and raised an eyebrow.

&quot;Show us, or this female dies!&quot; Dolza ordered and squeezed enough to 
make Akane whimper.

Ranma and Lisa looked at each other. Lisa nodded slightly and licked her 
lips nervously. Ranma unzipped his flight suit and pulled his arms out 
of the sleeves. He carefully removed the overly tight sports bra, which 
was actually something of a relief. With the upper part of his flight 
suit hanging around his waist he approached Lisa who was looking very 
shy and vulnerable.

He pulled Lisa to him and began to slowly caress her. First her arms and 
her back, and then around front to stroke her breasts. Lisa let out a 
little moan of pleasure. Ranma unzipped the front of her flight suit and 
slowly slid it down her arms. He began to stroke the bare skin he had 
revealed. He massaged her breast again through her bra, gently tweaking 
her nipples. Her hands had begun to stroke his powerfully built upper 
body as well. He pulled her close and leaned in, taking her lips in a 
deep passionate kiss.

They had been trying so hard to lose themselves in the pleasure of each 
others touch to forget they were doing this in front of an audience that 
they nearly missed it when the gathered Zentradi began to freak out in 
disgust at what they were seeing. They were brought back to reality to 
the howls of revulsion and horror the Zentradi were making.

&quot;Stop this,&quot; Dolza demanded, having released Akane during the first 
shock of the kiss. &quot;You must stop this at once!&quot;

&quot;That was disgusting,&quot; the large metal-faced one said as Lisa and Ranma 
separated.

&quot;That was &#39;sex&#39;?&quot; the bug-eyed one asked.

&quot;Oh no, that was just foreplay,&quot; Vicki said helpfully with a smug grin 
as she watched the Zentradi squirm uncomfortably. &quot;That was just 
kissing, part of getting prepared for sex. Sex is when the man gets 
aroused and his penis gets hard. Once the woman is ready, prepared by 
the foreplay, he sticks his penis in her vagina and works it in and 
out.&quot;

By now the Zentradi were looking positively green...even those that 
weren&#39;t positively green naturally.

&quot;Stop, I wish to hear no more,&quot; the metal-faced one moaned.

&quot;Yes, take them away,&quot; Dolza ordered. &quot;I think I&#39;m going to be sick.&quot;

&quot;Geez,&quot; Ranma commented, slipping the top of his flight suit back on and 
stuffing his bra in the pocket. &quot;Talk about a world-class case of 
repression...&quot;

Lisa giggled and slipped back into the top of her flight suit.

(oO\O/Oo)

&#39;Man this is easier than I thought,&#39; Max thought to himself as he 
maneuvered his battloid through the corridors of the Zentradi ship in 
his commandeered uniform.

Max had slipped back aboard the ship through a hole left from previous 
battle damage, after being blown out of the bay they had been fighting 
in. He had thought the jig was up when the soldier had opened the 
compartment he was hiding in, but Max was able to subdue the alien and 
take his uniform to use as a disguise. Thus far he had passed several 
others of the Zentradi soldiers and no one had questioned him.

Up in the distance, Max spotted two more of the soldiers pushing a cart 
of some sort. Something on the cart caught his eye and he zoomed in on 
it with the optical scanners. It was a stroke of luck. He had found his 
captured teammates.

Max discreetly followed the pair until they reached a compartment. They 
placed the small humans inside and closed the door. Max looked on as the 
pair took up guard beside the door. He would have to wait for at least 
one of them to leave before he made his move. He settled in for a long 
wait.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;I was thinking,&quot; Ranma said with a mischievous grin.

&quot;I thought I smelled hair burning,&quot; Lisa teased as she snuggled into 
Ranma&#39;s side where they were sitting on the floor with their backs to 
the wall.

&quot;Ha ha,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Anyway, I was thinking we might have a new weapon 
to use against these Zentradi.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Lisa asked interestedly.

&quot;Yup, all we have to do is anytime they attack start broadcasting 
pornographic videos and watch them run,&quot; Ranma chuckled.

&quot;Oh you,&quot; Lisa laughed and playfully punched him in the side.

Akane came over and knelt on the floor in front of them, looking down.

&quot;Were you two really going to...&quot; she trailed off unable to say the 
words.

&quot;Make love,&quot; Lisa supplied and Akane nodded.

&quot;...in front of all those alien perverts just to save me?&quot; she finished.

&quot;Well, we were going to try,&quot; Ranma admitted. &quot;I don&#39;t know if it would 
have worked. Not that making love to Lisa is not my favorite thing in 
the universe, but I don&#39;t know if I could have performed for an 
audience.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for what I said about you,&quot; Akane said. &quot;I really have no 
right to judge you. This is twice you&#39;ve saved my life and I&#39;ve been 
watching you. You may look like a guy right now, but you move and talk 
like a woman still.&quot; Ranma blushed in shame.

&quot;Yeah, well, like I said, I&#39;m not a guy anymore,&quot; Ranma said sadly. 
&quot;I&#39;ve lived as a woman for too long. Even when I was a guy all the time, 
Pop never let me be around people long enough to learn any social skills 
as a guy. When I finally got away from him, I finally started to develop 
socially, only because I was a girl all the time, I learned female 
social skills.&quot;

&quot;It really doesn&#39;t matter to you that he...she...changes, does it?&quot; 
Akane asked Lisa.

&quot;Whatever the body, it&#39;s always my Ranma,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Ever since the 
Academy, she has always been my best friend. When my fianc&eacute; Karl was 
killed on Mars and Ranma came back into my life, I wasn&#39;t sure what I 
felt for her. I was attracted to guys, but I felt a deep connection to 
her. I slowly realized that I was attracted to her female body as much 
as this one. Maybe more so since she&#39;s much more confident as a woman.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m happy for you both,&quot; Akane said sadly. &quot;I wish I could find someone 
to love me like that.&quot;

&quot;Someday you will, Akane,&quot; Ranma said, reaching out and taking her hand. 
&quot;I think if I had come with Pop to meet your family I would have loved 
you. You&#39;re a good person Akane. A little short tempered, but a great 
person. I already thought of you as a friend, but now that you know, if 
you can accept me, you can be one of my best friends. I don&#39;t have many. 
Basically, Vicki, Claudia Grant, Roy Fokker, and, of course, Lisa. Tia 
knew as well before she died. She and Vicki stood by me while the rest 
of the Roses took a while to come to terms with it when they found out.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that, Ranma,&quot; Akane said.

&quot;Thanks, Akane,&quot; Ranma said giving her hand a squeeze before letting go. 
&quot;Now how about we think of a plan to get out of here?&quot;

&quot;I have an idea,&quot; Lisa said, grinning lecherously.

&quot;Do tell,&quot; Ranma grinned.

&quot;Well, you saw how they reacted when we kissed,&quot; Lisa explained. &quot;All we 
have to do is wait for a guard to open the door and we start kissing. 
While he&#39;s stunned we make a break for it.&quot;

&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;I thought you&#39;d like that plan,&quot; Lisa batted her eyelashes at him and 
Akane giggled.

&quot;Blimey,&quot; Vicki shook her head and laughed. &quot;I&#39;m going to have to get 
bloody dentures if I have to spend too much more time around the two of 
you.&quot;

It was another half an hour before they heard some noises at the door. 
Ranma and Lisa got into position in the center of the room and began 
making out. Akane and Vicki stood to either side of the door and got 
ready to run for it.

The door slid open to reveal a frozen Zentradi soldier.

(oO\O/Oo)

Max had been waiting about an hour before he saw one of the guards 
leave. He peered around the corner and the other guard gave a mighty 
yawn. &#39;Great,&#39; Max thought. &#39;He&#39;s not very alert. Now&#39;s my chance.&#39;

Max moved into the corridor and walked along until he got in front of 
the guard. He spun around and delivered a haymaker to the surprised 
guard&#39;s chin. Max tapped the door controls and the door slid open.

Max could only stand in shock as he looked at Commander Hayes making out 
with some guy. Where the hell did the guy come from? The Zentradi must 
have captured others. Then he stated to notice things about the guy, 
like the fact he was wearing a pink and white flight suit that looked 
too small and the fact that his black hair was in a French braid. This 
was definitely weird. Then he heard Vicki&#39;s voice.

&quot;Come on Mum, Commander, it&#39;s working, let&#39;s get out of here,&quot; she 
yelled and she and Akane ran into the door way.

&quot;Wait, it&#39;s me, Max,&quot; Max said.

Everybody stopped.

&quot;Max?&quot; Vicki said looking up at him. Max pulled his hat back a little to 
reveal his battloid head. &quot;Bloody marvelous,&quot; Vicki laughed.

&quot;Come on lets get out of here,&quot; Max said. &quot;Commander Hayes, who&#39;s your 
new boy friend? And where&#39;s Mom?&quot; Lisa could almost here a hint of 
disapproval in his voice.

&quot;It&#39;s a long story, Max,&quot; Lisa said.

&quot;He is Ranma, Max,&quot; Akane said.

&quot;Damn, what did they do to you, Mom?&quot; Max said, horrified.

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you the whole story when we have more time,&quot; Ranma said. 
&quot;Right now we need to move out.&quot;

Max dragged the guard in to the cell and placed Ranma and Lisa in one 
pocket and Akane and Vicki in the other. They left the cell and began 
walking down the hall, passing the other guard that was returning. The 
guard got past them and noticed his partner wasn&#39;t at his post.

&quot;Hey you!&quot; the guard yelled whirling about and leveling his weapon. 
&quot;Stop right there!&quot;

But Max was already running. The guard opened fire and shots streaked 
pass them down the corridor, a few of them going through Max&#39;s Veritech.

&quot;Guardian mode, Max,&quot; Ranma yelled.

&quot;Right!&quot; Max called back and switched to guardian mode to get more 
speed.

Streaking down the corridor they smashed through a window. Ranma briefly 
identified Dolza and metal-face diving to the floor as the Veritech 
ripped through the air over them and flew through the control room and 
into another corridor. Now there was a platoon of Zentradi on their 
heels firing at them down the corridor.

&quot;The elevator!&quot; Max said. &quot;We&#39;ll lose them by going to another level.&quot;

They flew down the corridor toward the elevator, which was just opening. 
The soldier inside had to dive out as the gunfire peppered where he had 
just been standing. Max brought the Veritech to a halt inside the 
elevator and slowly lifted the guardian&#39;s arm to the switch.

&quot;I&#39;m losing power and overheating, somebody has to hit the switch,&quot; Max 
called.

&quot;Roger,&quot; Ranma yelled and jumped out onto the arm and ran toward the 
switch. He hit the switch and the elevator door shut in the face of lead 
pursuing Zentradi.

As the elevator descended, Max popped the canopy.

&quot;This thing&#39;s gonna blow real soon,&quot; he said.

&quot;We&#39;ll just have to find our way out on foot then,&quot; Lisa said.

&quot;Right,&quot; Max said as he jumped to the ground with a laser rifle.

The elevator door opened and the five of them rushed out, only to 
scatter when a Zentradi tried to dive on them. Ranma, Lisa, and Max went 
one way and Vicki and Akane went the other. The Zentradi was just 
getting up when the Veritech blew, killing him.

As Ranma, Lisa, and Max wandered through the corridors looking for a way 
out, Ranma explained about his condition. They found themselves looking 
into a room with large tanks with smaller tanks in front of them. It 
looked as though there were Zentradi in the large tanks, but in the 
smaller human sized tanks, copies of the larger aliens seemed to be 
forming.

&quot;I guess if I&#39;m seeing this, I can believe your story, Mom,&quot; Max 
chuckled.

&quot;That must be why they all look the same,&quot; Lisa opined. &quot;They&#39;re 
clones.&quot;

&quot;But what do you suppose is going on there?&quot; Ranma wondered. &quot;It looks 
like they are being shrunk down to human size.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Lisa admitted as she took video of the tanks with her 
micro video recorder.

Their speculation was interrupted by the appearance of a soldier and 
they decided to fade before they were spotted. After wandering the 
corridors for a while they found themselves in an armory. They hid 
behind a rack of rifles to rest for a bit.

&quot;Man, this is really weird seeing you like this, Mom,&quot; Max shook his 
head. &quot;Are you sure you started out as a guy? I mean because, you 
definitely look like a guy, but there&#39;s no question it&#39;s a woman behind 
the wheel so to speak.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I was a guy for the first 16 years of my life, Max,&quot; Ranma 
grinned ruefully.

&quot;That&#39;s hilarious,&quot; Max said. &quot;Miss Macross, the most desirable female 
on the ship, used to be a man. Well at least now I know why you made me 
wear the pink flight suit,&quot; Max laughed.

&quot;Well, if I had to, then I don&#39;t see why you couldn&#39;t,&quot; Ranma chuckled. 
&quot;But that&#39;s only a small part of it. It was an esprit de corps thing. I 
wanted to make sure you got accepted since a lot of those women were 
fond of the idea of an all female squadron. If I let you wear a 
different flight suit from everyone else then it would be like you were 
ashamed to wear the unit colors and thus ashamed to be part of the unit. 
They would have resented you for that.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Max said. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t mind, really. I&#39;m proud to be part of 
your unit and we do seem to be a tighter nit unit than the others. Do 
all of them know about you?&quot;

&quot;No, just the original five, you, and Akane,&quot; Ranma sighed. &quot;I guess I&#39;m 
going to have to tell them when we get back. I went for nearly seven 
years without being changed by accident and now it&#39;s happened twice in 
less than six months. I&#39;m tired of having to explain things to people 
that are already pissed off because they found out by accident.&quot;

&quot;I can understand that,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;That&#39;s not a bad idea. I want to be 
there as well to explain that this is classified information.&quot;

&quot;You got it, Love,&quot; Ranma said.

Just then a huge hand came down and grabbed Lisa.

&quot;Gotcha, Micronian,&quot; the soldier laughed.

&quot;Lisa!&quot; Ranma yelled and charged the Zentradi.

The Zentradi kicked Ranma, knocking him back into the rack of rifles 
causing them to collapse on him.

&quot;Ranma!&quot; Lisa yelled, seeing Ranma buried under the rifles.

The Zentradi turned toward the door but he didn&#39;t get far when a rifle 
shot rang out. Ranma had picked up one of the giant rifles and was 
holding it aimed while Max was pulling the trigger. Five shots rang out 
hitting the soldier center mass. The alien convulsed and dropped Lisa.

Lisa yelled as she fell toward the floor, but then she found herself in 
Ranma&#39;s arms as he had leaped into the air and caught her. They landed 
lightly and Lisa hugged him tightly in relief. However, more soldiers 
came running at the sound of the rifle fire and the trio had to run for 
their lives with the Zentradi in hot pursuit.

As they ran out on to a catwalk, the soldiers began to open fire. The 
floor of the catwalk began to disintegrate under the rifle fire and the 
three fleeing humans fell though. Ranma pulled Lisa to him and used his 
aerial martial arts skills to direct their fall. He bounced off of pipes 
and walls slowing their fall until they landed lightly beside a large 
puddle of water. Max wasn&#39;t so lucky. He had no way to slow his fall but 
he landed in the water. He was knocked out by the impact but appeared 
okay otherwise. Lisa went out and got him, so that he could see Ranma&#39;s 
transformation when he came to.

&quot;Man, for all their high-tech equipment, they sure let this place get 
run down,&quot; Ranma commented as they waited for Max to wake up.

&quot;It&#39;s almost as if they don&#39;t know how to fix their own ships,&quot; Lisa 
said. &quot;Have you noticed, that all we&#39;ve seen are soldiers, no civilians, 
or technicians or anything?&quot;

&quot;They seem to be a society of only warriors,&quot; Ranma admitted. &quot;I wonder 
how many planets they&#39;ve destroyed, how many lives they taken?&quot;

&quot;They probably don&#39;t even know,&quot; Lisa said.

&quot;I&#39;ve trained all my life to be a warrior, but even I think it&#39;s pretty 
pathetic that all they know is war,&quot; Ranma said contemptuously.

&quot;I can understand their way,&quot; Lisa commented. &quot;I&#39;m like that in a lot of 
ways.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re nothing like them, Lisa,&quot; Ranma said firmly. &quot;They are brutal, 
barbaric killers.&quot;

&quot;But still, I&#39;ve come from over a hundred years of military tradition,&quot; 
Lisa pointed out. &quot;My family has always been a military family. My 
father always said &#39;Where there is a battle being fought there&#39;s a life 
being lived&#39;.&quot;

&quot;In a way I can understand that saying,&quot; Ranma commented. &quot;But I don&#39;t 
believe in the glorious battle concept. In battle, defending others, I 
feel my purpose is being served, but I hate it. I hate taking life. I 
understand that it&#39;s necessary, but battle is a horrible, ugly thing. 
There is no glory in watching your friends get taken from you. There is 
no glory in having the blood of others on your hands. Anyone that thinks 
that is fucked up. I don&#39;t feel alive in battle. I feel alive when I&#39;m 
together with you or with my friends, but mostly you.&quot;

Lisa hugged Ranma and snuggled up to him. They sat quietly together for 
a while.

Max groaned as he began to come to. &quot;Oww, what happened?&quot;

&quot;We fell,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;The water broke your fall.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Max said sitting up. &quot;Man, I hurt. Any idea where we are?&quot;

&quot;Nope, none,&quot; Ranma chuckled.

&quot;Situation unchanged then,&quot; Max said.

&quot;Here, Lisa managed to find your glasses,&quot; Ranma said passing them over.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Max said putting them on.

&quot;Now are you ready for something completely different?&quot; Ranma smirked.

&quot;What would that be?&quot; Max asked.

&quot;Well, I waited until you were awake before I changed back to my female 
form,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;I thought you might like to see it.&quot;

&quot;By all means,&quot; Max said.

&quot;Okay now watch closely,&quot; Ranma said and stepped over to the water.

He cupped his hands and brought the water to his face, splashing 
himself. As Max watched his body seemed to flow like the water and form 
itself into a smaller form and the hair changed from black to fiery red. 
When it finished, the whole process had taken a second or less, but his 
familiar CO was back before him.

&quot;Amazing,&quot; Max said in wonder. Ranma laughed.

&quot;Okay, now turn around and don&#146;t look,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Flight suits are 
kinda rough on unprotected breasts. I have to put my bra back on.&quot;

Max turned around and Ranma unzipped her flight suit shrugging out of 
the top and removing the bra from the pocket she had placed it in 
earlier. She quickly slipped it on and adjusted it noting the Lisa had 
no compunction at all with watching her avidly. She gave the brunette a 
smile and slid her arms back into the flight suit before zipping it up.

&quot;Okay, I&#39;m decent,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;More like delectable,&quot; Lisa smirked, causing Ranma to giggle.

&quot;I have to admit,&quot; Max grinned, &quot;I like you much better this way.&quot;

&quot;Yeah? Me too,&quot; Ranma laughed. &quot;Now let&#39;s get moving or we&#39;ll never get 
out of here.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Whoa, look at all those ships,&quot; Max said in awe.

&quot;Yeah, there must be a million of them,&quot; Ranma said, knowing this was 
only part of the total fleet. They had seen a lot more ships on the way 
inside this place. &quot;We&#39;d never be able fight off this many.&quot;

&quot;We have to get back to Earth and make sure it never comes to that,&quot; 
Lisa said firmly.

Just then they heard footsteps behind them. They quickly ducked around 
the doorway and pressed themselves against the wall.

&quot;Where do you think we are?&quot; a familiar female voice said.

&quot;How the bloody hell should I know?&quot; another familiar woman replied.

&quot;Hey guys,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Fancy meeting you here.&quot;

&quot;Mom!&quot; Akane said. &quot;You&#39;re back!&quot; She hugged the redhead.

&quot;Yeah, we found some water,&quot; Ranma said, laughing. &quot;I&#39;m feeling much 
better now.&quot;

&quot;Looking much better too,&quot; Akane grinned.

&quot;Funny, that&#39;s just what Max said,&quot; Ranma smirked.

&quot;So have you guys come up with an idea of how we&#39;re going to get out of 
here?&quot; Vicki asked.

&quot;Well, that cruiser over there taking on supplies looks like it&#39;s going 
somewhere,&quot; Lisa suggested. &quot;How about we get on it?&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Ranma said.

The five humans made their way to the conveyor passing supplies to the 
cruiser and waited for the guard to turn his back. As soon as he did 
they jumped on the conveyor and were carried onto the ship. Jumping off 
they made their way to the hanger bay and hid.

&quot;Now that we&#39;re here, how do we get back to the SDF-1?&quot; Vicki asked.

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t see why four shit-hot pilots like yourselves can&#39;t figure 
out how to work one of those pods over there,&quot; Lisa suggested.

The four Wild Roses looked at each other and grinned.

It took them most of the fold to figure out how to get in to the thing. 
They had commenced defold as the four Roses were still figuring out the 
flight controls. Ranma brought the pod online and the view screen came 
up to reveal a guard standing in the bay. The noise of the pod powering 
up had attracted his attention.

&quot;We&#39;ve been discovered,&quot; Lisa said urgently. &quot;Do something.&quot;

Max moved his stick and pressed the button, firing one of the energy 
beams and taking out the guard. Ranma and Akane managed to bring the 
thing to its feet.

&quot;Now how do we get out of here?&quot; Lisa asked.

&quot;Leave that to us, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Max grinned and winked at Vicki who returned 
it. They both opened up with the pods weapons and blew a hole in the 
side of the ship. Ranma and Akane managed to move the thing out of the 
hole and they were free. Piloting the thing wasn&#39;t easy and they were 
very lucky that nobody was really trying to shoot at them. They were 
flying like a wounded duck.

Lisa tried tuning the radio to the SDF-1&#39;s frequency. She stumbled 
across a channel playing a Minmei song. They paused to listen for a 
minute.

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s Minmei,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;She must have made her singing debut 
while we were gone.&quot;

&quot;That means we&#39;re close to home!&quot; Lisa cheered. It was an unspoken fear 
that they would end up in some other system far from home with no way to 
get back.

&quot;Well, maybe you better get the SDF-1 on that thing before we get shot,&quot; 
Ranma suggested with a smile.

&quot;Roger,&quot; Lisa grinned and went back to tuning. &quot;This is Lisa Hayes and 
Elements of the Wild Rose Squadron. We have escaped the Zentradi and are 
in a commandeered battle pod. Request assistance.&quot;

&quot;Lisa is it really you?&quot; Claudia&#39;s voice came over the radio. &quot;Oh thank 
god.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Claudia,&quot; Lisa said happily. &quot;It&#39;s me and the rest of Wild Rose 
Alpha Flight. We all survived.&quot;

&quot;Outstanding,&quot; Claudia said happily. &quot;I&#39;ve sent some very eager folks 
out to help you.&quot;

&quot;Roger,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;We&#39;re the pod flying like a lame duck.&quot;

Soon a group of pink and white Veritechs approached then and grabbed on, 
flying them toward home.

As the humans were making good their escape, a new type of Zentradi 
mecha blasted its way through the Earth forces with terrible skill. It 
swiftly approached the SDF-1 and tore a hole in the hull. The mecha 
quickly deposited its cargo inside and sealed the hole before flying off 
in the confusion.

The object inside the hull popped open and three human sized figures 
emerged.

&quot;Hey, alright!&quot; one said. &quot;Miriya got us here. I can&#39;t wait to start 
spying.&quot;

&quot;But first we need some Micronian uniforms,&quot; another said.

&quot;What are we waiting for, let&#39;s go!&quot; the third said.
