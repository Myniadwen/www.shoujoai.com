<h1>Almost Foolproof</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/devildan.html">Devil Dan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>      On a nice early winter Sunday a rather unlikely couple was walking 
down a lively shopping street in Tokyo. Walking off in front was a girl 
wearing a rather extravagant dress in the shades of magenta and pink 
with a dark-blue jacket. She had short dark-gray hair and her gray eyes 
where shining with happiness and pride. A short distance behind her was 
a boy with pointy black hair wearing white trousers, a brown-green 
jacket and a cardboard box filled with cute little stuffed animals of 
the sort you might find in an UFO-catcher. The boy&#39;s brown eyes looked 
more serious.
      &quot;What are you going to do with all of these!?&quot; The boy asked.
      The girl stopped and turned around. When the boy finally caught up 
with her, she took a green stuffed kawako. She cuddled it to her face. 
&quot;Aren&#39;t they cute? Soft and fuzzy!&quot;
      The boy seemed to be angry. &quot;Come on! We got other things to worry 
about! I&#39;m flat broke! I don&#39;t even have money for the train home!&quot;
      The girl shoved the kawako into the boy&#39;s face, then held it 
before him moving it&#39;s head as if it was talking. She spoke in a higher 
tone. &quot;Don&#39;t be so grouchy. That&#39;s why you&#39;re called &#39;Dateless&#39;!&quot;
      &quot;Don&#39;t you get it? We can&#39;t even go home now!&quot;
      The girl stopped smiling. She took the box from the boy. &quot;I get 
it! I&#39;ll find a way.&quot;
      The boy just blinked twice.
      They walked for a bit in silence until the girl suddenly stopped. 
&quot;I&#39;ve got an idea!&quot; From nowhere she produced a white sheet and a big 
piece of paper that she folded into a makeshift fan. She spread the 
sheet on the sidewalk, put down the box and sat beside it. She arranged 
a couple of the stuffed toys around her and hit the ground with her fan 
to get the attention of bystanders. &quot;Hurry, hurry! Step right up!&quot; She 
shouted. &quot;Such cute toys for only 500 yen!&quot; In seconds a group of men 
gathered around her and the boy. &quot;Do you have the guts? Just 500 yen! 
Win a game of janken and I&#39;ll throw in a kiss! Come one, come all!&quot;
      The boy was on one knee before her. &quot;Ai, the &quot;kiss&quot; is going 
overboard.&quot; He didn&#39;t manage to say anything else as he was pulled back 
trough the wall of men standing around.
      &quot;I&#39;m yer first customer!&quot; A man kneeled down before her holding a 
five hundred yen piece. &quot;You ain&#39;t lyin&#39; about the kiss? I win, I get a 
kiss?&quot;
      Ai took the coin. &quot;Thanks!&quot; And gave him a pink stuffed animal.
      Then they played. &quot;Jan-Ken-Pu!&quot; They shouted in unison and at &quot;Pu&quot; 
each made a gesture with their hand. Ai&#39;s was scissors and the man&#39;s was 
paper. Ai won. &quot;Thank you!&quot; She made a &quot;V&quot; with her hand and smiled a 
cute smile that only a video girl managed. Suddenly everyone wanted to 
try. Shouts of &quot;Jan-Ken-Pu!&quot; filled the air, five hundred yen coins 
filled a small box and the box containing stuffed toys was emptying.
      The pointy-haired boy was looking on. &#39;Seems that Ai knows, what 
she&#39;s doing.&#39; He thought. &#39;I wonder, how she manages to win all the 
time.&#39;
      Then Ai threw one five hundred yen piece to him. &quot;Yota, go get us 
some tea, will&#39;ya?&quot;
      He caught the coin &quot;Uh.. Hai!&quot; And he walked off looking for the 
nearest vending machine.
      Off course Ai wasn&#39;t stupid enough to bet on luck. As a video girl 
she was made to know men&#39;s minds. It was easy to tell what they would 
choose. Her plan was foolproof. Well... almost foolproof. That showed 
when there where only two toys left. The green kawako she was playing 
with earlier and a blue teddy bear.
      &quot;I&#39;ll try next.&quot;
      Ai looked up after the voice. Standing before her was a boy with 
short blonde hair and blue eyes. He wore a school uniform consisting of 
blue trousers and a brown jacked. On the jacket was a black star with an 
infinite-symbol in it and the name of a school under it. He looked just 
like the hero of a shoujo manga. Handsome and cute at the same time. 
Just the type most girls would die for. He kneeled down, gave Ai a coin 
and took the blue bear.
      They both raised their right hand to play. There Ai froze. &#39;I... I 
can&#39;t tell what he&#39;s going to choose!&#39; There was no turning back, so she 
brought her hand down choosing paper. The boy had scissors.
      &quot;I win.&quot; He smiled. &quot;Now to collect my prize.&quot; He leaned a little 
forward.
       &#39;Is this going to be my first kiss?&#39; Ai thought. She looked 
around. There was no escape. &#39;Well... I&#39;ll have to take it like a man... 
I mean girl.&#39; She leaned forward. Her heart started pounding. When her 
face was close enough to his, she closed her eyes. And she waited... and 
waited. Then she heard a chuckle. She opened her eyes to see the boy 
holding himself from breaking into laughter. Ai frowned. &quot;What is it?&quot;
      &quot;Oh nothing.&quot; The boy laughed out loud. That frown was just too 
cute.
      In the meantime a girl with long aquamarine hair and blue eyes 
made her way trough the crowd. She wore a similar uniform to the boy&#39;s. 
Only that hers had a green skirt instead of trousers and her jacket had 
a black sailor collar and a green bow in front. And she carried a violin 
case. She looked at Ai, combined her expression with what she had heard 
from the crowd and knew what was going on. She smiled. The men around 
her were trying not to drool. &quot;Haruka, stop teasing the girl.&quot;
      The blonde boy, Haruka, stood up and went over to the green haired 
girl. &quot;I was just having a little fun. Here.&quot; He gave her the bear he 
had bought.
      &quot;Thank you.&quot; She accepted the toy and admired it.
      Haruka put a hand around her waist and looked at Ai. &quot;Sorry, but I 
already have a girlfriend.&quot;
      Ai couldn&#39;t help but stare at them. They were such a lovely 
couple. He was the shoujo manga hero and she was his destined love. The 
video girl just hoped Yota would be a little bit more like him. &quot;Th.. 
That&#39;s all right.&quot; She managed to get out.
      Haruka turned back to his girlfriend. &quot;Come on Michiru. We have 
reservations.&quot; With that said they made their way back trough the crowd.
      By then Yota was back with two cans of tea. He handed one to Ai. 
&quot;Aren&#39;t you finished yet?&quot;
      &quot;I&#39;m finished. Let&#39;s go.&quot;

Author&#39;s notes: It just occurred to me that Ai&#39;s plan had one flaw. What 
if a woman wanted to play? So I wrote this bit. It&#39;s set into the anime, 
because Ai&#39;s rock-scissors-paper game wasn&#39;t in the manga. I hope you 
enjoyed it. Please review at FanFiction.net or email me.

Ja ne!
