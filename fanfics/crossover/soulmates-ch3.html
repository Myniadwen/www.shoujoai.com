<a href="../crossover/soulmates-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Samus went to sit on one of the benches that littered the park-like 
enclosure. She sat and stretched her arms out over the back of the 
bench, leaned back and looked up at the stars through the clear dome. 
Nicole paced back and forth a few feet away, nervously tapping her 
fingers on her thigh. The tension in the air was obvious to both of 
them. Nicole stole a quick glance at Samus then looked away quickly as 
Samus looked to her then away herself. She bounced her knee while Nicole 
continued to pace. 
 
&quot;I um...&quot; they said in unison then shut up as they realized the other 
was talking. But they both forgot what they were going to say and the 
uncomfortable silence continued on. Samus tilted her head back and 
closed her eyes trying to focus her thoughts elsewhere. Nicole however 
dwelled on it. 
 
&#39;What was it that just happened between us? Was I just imagining it or 
did she feel it too? She must have.&#39; What to do? Should she say 
something? But what? She couldn&#39;t think of anything... she&#39;d been alone 
for months and she had become unaccustomed to talking. She preferred 
action to words anyway. Nicole sat down on the bench next to her so that 
Samus&#39; outstretched arm was behind her shoulders. 
 
Samus&#39; eyes snapped open and she looked to Nicole a bit. What was she 
doing!? Samus&#39; heart skipped a few beats; she essentially had her arm 
around Nicole. What was this? Nicole smiled nervously at her then turned 
her head away and sat there for a bit, again tapping her fingers on her 
thigh. Then, finally working up the courage, she cautiously reached for 
Samus&#39; hand that was over her shoulder; lightly just laying her fingers 
across the back of Samus&#39; fingers at first, and then gently closing her 
hand around them. Samus turned her head away and froze; her entire body 
didn&#39;t move an inch, like she was a statue. She fought to control the 
trembling in the limb that Nicole held. Nicole now firmly took Samus&#39; 
hand in hers, palm to palm. Samus turned to Nicole again, she looked 
desperately confused, even a little frightened. This, even the simplest 
of human contact, was clearly new territory for her. Nicole gave her 
hand a reassuring squeeze. Forcibly suppressing her fear and 
apprehension Samus squeezed back. Nicole couldn&#39;t help but smile at the 
small accomplishment. 
 
Nicole had only really intended it to go as far as that, however, what 
had started innocently enough quickly snowballed into something else, 
because Samus now found her arm unconsciously sliding off the back of 
the bench and around Nicole&#39;s shoulders. Almost immediately and without 
thought Nicole leaned over and rested her head on Samus&#39; shoulder. Samus 
tensed up when she realized what had just happened; Nicole&#39;s soft, warm 
body rested against hers. She looked down at Nicole, feeling light 
headed. Nicole&#39;s loose brown hair obscured her face. Samus now 
inexplicably felt she absolutely needed to see her face. Her right hand 
came up to Nicole&#39;s head; and she ran her fingers slowly across her 
forehead, brushing aside the loose strands of hair, then allowed her 
hand to trail down the side of her face. Nicole looked up at her 
questioningly and her soft brown orbs met Samus&#39; piercing azure gems; it 
was like they fell into a trap, unable to escape each other&#39;s gaze. 
Samus had never been this close to another person before. Why did she 
feel this way; not in control? Normally she was in complete control of 
her emotions; calm, cool, collected, some would even call her stone 
cold. But now she was a maelstrom in side; experiencing a spinning, 
swirling, dizzying sensation, staring at Nicole like that. 
 
Samus drew closer and closer to Nicole, compelled by some irresistible 
force. She paused when she felt Nicole&#39;s breath on her, but only for a 
moment. With mouths slightly agape and eyes intently locked on each 
other, Samus nervously closed the remaining distance, and gingerly took 
Nicole&#39;s lower lip between her own lips, whilst Nicole took Samus&#39; upper 
lip between hers. They pursed their lips together softly, held that 
position for but a second, then ever so slowly slid apart from one 
another, maintaining eye contact the entire time. With their faces still 
less than an inch apart Samus stared dumbfounded into Nicole&#39;s eyes, a 
flood of emotions she&#39;d never felt before threatened to completely 
overwhelm her. Nicole was feeling quite flustered herself. Unable to 
take it any longer Samus pulled back and away; sliding to the end of the 
bench, she turned her back to Nicole. 
 
&quot;I... Sorry, I... I shouldn&#39;t have... I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Samus spoke in a 
quiet, nervous voice. 
 
&quot;Don&#39;t apologize.&quot; Nicole slid up next to her again. She took Samus by 
the chin and turned her head around so they were facing each other 
again. &quot;It&#39;s ok, don&#39;t be afraid.&quot; she spoke softly. Their eyes met 
again and Nicole leaned in for more, not content with that brief 
contact. Samus attempted to speak but was unable to force any air from 
her lungs. Nicole took Samus&#39; hand in hers, and placed her other hand 
around the back of Samus&#39; neck. &quot;It&#39;s ok.&quot; Nicole repeated reassuringly 
as she drifted closer. 
 
Samus had never been this nervous in her life; the anticipation of 
facing a horde of Space Pirates, or the prospect of plunging head first 
into a pool of boiling lava and trusting her suit would protect her 
somehow paled in comparison to this. Samus knew this was what &#39;normal&#39; 
people did, and she was fairly sure she wanted to, but she still wasn&#39;t 
fully capable of accepting the reality of the fact that it was her doing 
these things and having these feelings. It was like it was something 
exclusively for those other &#39;normal&#39; people and had no place in the life 
of someone like her. 
 
That thought train was thoroughly derailed when Nicole finally kissed 
her again. Their lips meeting with the softest of pressure, kissing ever 
so slowly, both still very timid about the situation; Samus still deeply 
confused. She was attacked by a slew of new emotions that she didn&#39;t 
even have words for, as well as new physical sensations; her brain 
racing to incorporate, to understand it all. Yet at the same time she 
didn&#39;t want to think, to analyze, she just wanted to let it be. Those 
feelings that threatened to overwhelm her earlier finally did and she 
gave herself over to them. She leaned back against the bench, sighed 
softly and relaxed. Closing her eyes, she shut out the rest of the 
world, the only sensation was Nicole&#39;s lips on hers and the heart 
pounding in her chest. And for a moment that&#39;s all there was. 
 
Though the moment then ended when Nicole&#39;s lips were no longer there. 
Samus opened her eyes and slowly came back to reality, she now heard the 
whooshing sound that had distracted Nicole. The airlock at the far end 
of the dome opened revealing her ship docked inside. 
 
Samus stood from the bench now feeling a little embarrassed, she looked 
at Nicole with a nervous smile. &quot;We, uh... we should... go now.&quot; 
 
&quot;Oh...all right...&quot; Nicole sighed, disappointed. Why couldn&#39;t that ship 
have taken longer to get there? 
 
&quot;Need help carrying that?&quot; Samus said referring to the pieces of 
Nicole&#39;s armor lying in a pile on the floor. 
 
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Nicole nodded. 
 
They collected the bits of her armor, one by one tossing them into the 
ships top hatch. Samus jumped in the hatch first, Nicole jumped in after 
her. As she landed, instinctively, Samus partially caught her, with her 
arms winding up around Nicole&#39;s waist. 
 
&quot;Uh, thanks...&quot; Nicole said. 
 
&quot;Yeah... no problem,&quot; Samus said uneasily as she released Nicole. 
 
She climbed into the pilot&#39;s seat and lifted the ship off and left the 
station once and for all. She set course for the Federation&#39;s capital 
world and engaged the ship&#39;s autopilot. Since the pilot&#39;s seat was the 
only place to sit Nicole stood leaning against the wall, though she had 
to lean to the side a little and duck because the ceiling wasn&#39;t very 
high. A while passed in silence as Nicole stood there. They occasionally 
traded glances and timid smiles at each other. A long tense moment 
passed before finally Samus spoke. 
 
&quot;You don&#39;t have to stand. You&#39;ll get a crick in your neck.&quot; 
 
&quot;I&#39;ll be fine. Besides there&#39;s no place to--&quot; Nicole didn&#39;t have a 
chance to finish as Samus had grabbed her by the arm and pulled her into 
her lap. Nicole was a little startled at first but she relaxed and 
accepted it. Samus hugged her from behind and rested her chin on her 
shoulder. 
 
&quot;This is... all right?&quot; Samus asked. 
 
Nicole turned her head to the side to face Samus. &quot;Yeah... it&#39;s ok,&quot; she 
said and stared at Samus with those beautiful brown eyes of hers. 
 
She couldn&#39;t resist that look Nicole gave her; Samus was drawn in and 
kissed her delicately once again. Nicole sighed softly and reached up 
behind Samus&#39; head as she kissed back. At that point they really started 
to get into it; what was gentle and exploratory, more experimenting than 
anything else, quickly changed to something more passionate and 
intimate. Nicole pulled Samus by the back of the head, firmly pressing 
into her as they began deep open mouth kisses. 
 
Nicole turned over, kneeling in the chair and straddling Samus. She held 
Samus&#39; face gently between her hands, tilted her head up slightly and 
resumed kissing her passionately. Soon, wandering hands began groping, 
massaging, and slipping beneath clothing. Breaths became deep and 
labored, a thigh pressed against a place it shouldn&#39;t have, and kisses 
were not just on the lips any longer. Nicole started pulling Samus&#39; top 
off. 
 
&quot;Wait.&quot; Samus said breathlessly, breaking their kiss. She put her hands 
on Nicole&#39;s shoulders and held her away a little. &quot;What... what are we 
doing? This is... very sudden ...we hardly know each other.&quot; 
 
Nicole looked down seeming to ponder this fact. &quot;I&#39;ve always lived life 
in the moment; I know... I can tell you&#39;re the same. For people like 
us... there might not always be a tomorrow.&quot; Samus timidly nodded in 
agreement, yet looked away not making eye contact. &quot;You don&#39;t want to? 
...it&#39;s ok... I get it...&quot; 
 
&quot;I- I do... I do want to... it&#39;s just, well... I never... I&#39;ve never 
done anything like this...&quot; Her eyes cast downward, &quot;It&#39;s pathetic, I 
know...&quot; she sighed, &quot;...I ...I hadn&#39;t even kissed anyone before.&quot; 
 
Nicole smiled and caressed her face &quot;I know... me neither... This is... 
It&#39;s all completely new to me too.&quot; 
 
&quot;You&#39;re kidding, right? You... you just seem so confident.&quot; 
 
&quot;Well I just know what I want.&quot; 
 
&quot;What-- what is it you want?&quot; 
 
&quot;Right now... You.&quot; 
 
Samus half smiled at that and allowed Nicole to start kissing her again, 
and this time when Nicole tried to remove her clothing Samus didn&#39;t 
object. 
 
------ 
 
Nicole awoke to a beeping sound; where was she? She looked around still 
groggy... a ship? Suddenly she realized she was half naked. &quot;What 
the...&quot; She sat up in the bed... or was it a chair? Then she realized 
she wasn&#39;t the only one in the chair. She was sitting on top of another 
woman who also happened to be only partially clothed. &quot;Uh...&quot; Slowly the 
previous night&#39;s events came back to her as she became more alert. 
&quot;Samus?&quot; A smile crept across her face as she recalled all the things 
they had done. She looked out the ship&#39;s window to see where they were. 
The ship had set down on a landing pad beside a small structure. There 
were many other similar buildings scattered about the landscape, set 
amongst lush trees. On the horizon was an expansive cityscape of 
countless skyscrapers; ships formed endlessly flowing streams going to 
and from the city. 
 
Nicole&#39;s stirring and the continued beeping woke Samus as well. &quot;It&#39;s 
Kortalth, the Federation&#39;s capital world.&quot; Samus said, seeing Nicole 
looking out the window. She sat up and put her hand on Nicole&#39;s 
shoulder. &quot;I live here. This is my house.&quot; 
 
&quot;Oh...&quot; 
 
&quot;So... Nicole, what are you going to do now?&quot; 
 
&quot;I guess I don&#39;t really know.&quot; 
 
&quot;I mean this is a whole new world for you.&quot; 
 
&quot;Yeah...&quot; 
 
&quot;Everyone you knew and everything you were part of is long since gone. 
So... where will you go? How will you live?&quot; 
 
&quot;I guess I&#39;ll... find something... start over. Maybe I&#39;ll do what you 
do. It&#39;s probably all I&#39;m cutout for anyway.&quot; 
 
&quot;You&#39;d be good at it... uh... It could take sometime to get started with 
that. What will you do till then?&quot; 
 
&quot;Hmm... I&#39;ll be alright. You don&#39;t have to worry about me.&quot; 
 
&quot;Well, you can... stay here if you want.&quot; 
 
&quot;Hey, listen...&quot; Nicole slid Samus&#39; hand off her shoulder and scooted 
off of her and onto the edge of the chair. &quot;...about last night... It 
was great but--&quot; 
 
&quot;Yeah, no, it&#39;s ok, I get it. It was what it was, but that&#39;s all, 
nothing more.&quot; Samus said quickly with a nervous vibration in her voice, 
while scratching the back of her neck. 
 
&quot;Right, let&#39;s not make anything out of it that it wasn&#39;t. Ok?&quot; 
 
&quot;I know. I wasn&#39;t... I didn&#39;t mean anything like that... uh...&quot; Samus 
said glancing to the side. &quot;It&#39;s just that you have no place to go 
really, no job, no money, so... just stay here until you get yourself 
together, that&#39;s all, ...just a temporary thing.&quot; 
 
Nicole still seemed unsure. 
 
&quot;I&#39;m not even here that much.&quot; Samus added a bit hastily. &quot;I live on 
this ship mostly.&quot; 
 
Nicole seemed to think it over some then finally relented. &quot;Just a 
temporary thing,&quot; she said nodding her acceptance. She really did have 
no place to go after all. 
 
Samus showed Nicole in, and gave her the tour of the place, if it could 
be called a tour that is; the house was fairly small. The front door 
opened onto the kitchen, which served as a hallway of sorts to the rest 
of the house. Beyond that was a single room, with a bed in one corner 
and a desk and computer in the other. On the far wall was the door to 
the bathroom. There was a large bay window by the bed with a view of the 
city. 
 
&quot;Hmm... It suits you,&quot; Nicole commented. 
 
&quot;Eh... It&#39;s not much I know. I&#39;d get a bigger place but I don&#39;t even use 
this one that much to begin with. ...Uh... I have to go out again, I&#39;ll 
be back tonight. Use whatever you need.&quot; 
 
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; 
 
&quot;I need to report back to the Federation what I found to complete my 
job... I...&quot; Samus paused, apparently thinking something over. &quot;It&#39;ll 
probably be alright, but they might want to question you... I don&#39;t 
know, they could make trouble for you, but maybe not. Just be aware of 
the possibility.&quot; 
 
&quot;Oh... yeah ok. Thanks.&quot; 
 
&quot;I... I could not tell them about you.&quot; 
 
&quot;No. You don&#39;t have to--&quot; 
 
&quot;Right, yeah. That was stupid. I don&#39;t know why I said that... I&#39;ll see 
you later.&quot; 
 
&quot;Mmh...&quot; Nicole nodded. 
 
And with that Samus was out the door. 
 
Nicole sighed. &#39;Inviting me to live with her, offering to lie to protect 
me... I hope she isn&#39;t getting any funny ideas... This was probably a 
mistake.&#39;
