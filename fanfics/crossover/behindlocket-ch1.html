<h1>Behind the Locket</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Standing out as a beacon in a run-down dangerous-looking part of town 
was a singular-looking building. Gathered in front of it were several 
women standing in line waiting to get in, and on the building itself was 
an animated neon sign which opened to reveal two women in a loving 
embrace.

It was of course the famed lesbian nightclub Arisugawa&#39;s Locket, 
existing simultaneously between several different realities and even 
timelines as a safe haven for lesbian women of every shape, size, and 
animation style.

As the sun sets and the doors to the locket are opened, in the alley 
behind the Locket, our story begins.

Mildred Mcgillicutty opened her eyes and let out a yawn as she crisply 
pulled the newspapers she used for a blanket off and proceeded to crawl 
out of her cardboard box. The blonde was smartly dressed in the same 
light blue dress she&#39;d been wearing since &#39;87, a torn red sweater over a 
Milli Vanilli T-shirt (the factory dumpster she&#39;d found it in was full 
to overflowing with the shirts after the whole lip-synching fiasco), a 
pair of scuffed red low-heeled pumps and a brown knit hat.

Reaching back into the box, she retrieved a bottle in a paper bag and 
expertly twisted the lid off for a swig. She then looked over to a 
nearby dumpster and smiled, &quot;Hey, Edna,&quot; she called over, &quot;Get yer lazy 
arse up!&quot;

There was a stir within the dumpster, then a woman slightly taller than 
Mildred with short-cropped hair popped out from under the garbage with a 
yawn. Edna Berskowsky smoothly removed a banana peel from her brunette 
head of hair as she proceeded to scratch her rear. She wore an old pair 
of checkered trousers she&#39;d found in a garbage can once outside a senior 
citizens home, some worn tennis shoes, and a tattered Toronto Maple 
Leafs shirt.

&quot;Any left,&quot; the brunette asked dashingly as she pointed to Mildred&#39;s 
bottle. The more feminine bag lady obliged her by passing it over, 
&quot;Don&#39;t swill all the hooch this time,&quot; she warned, &quot;Same some for me 
too.&quot;

Edna placed the bottle to her lips and took a swig. Passing it back to 
Mildred, she then crawled gingerly out of the dumpster, dusted herself 
off, and smiled. &quot;And how are you doing tonight, Mildred my love?&quot;

Mildred blushed cutely, &quot;There you go, trying to butter me up so you can 
get beneath my pants again.&quot;

&quot;Actually,&quot; Edna quipped, &quot;You&#39;re wearing a skirt. I&#39;m the one with the 
pants.&quot;

Mildred rolled her eyes, &quot;Whatever,&quot; she said as she finished off the 
bottle. &quot;Aaaaah, booze is good food,&quot; she exclaimed happily. &quot;So, 
what&#39;ll we do tonight?&quot;

&quot;Well, I was thinking we could go around collecting bottles for the 
deposit fee until we have maybe eight or ten dollars, then going to an 
all-night convenience store where we can grab some chips and maybe some 
of that cheapo wine they sell in the boxes. We can then head off to the 
park, find a nice secluded spot for a moonlight picnic&#133;&quot;

&quot;Oh, Edna,&quot; Mildred gushed, &quot;I never knew you were so romantic!&quot;

Just then, the back door to the locket opened and a rather intimidating 
woman with blue hair stepped out.

&quot;Hey you two!&quot; Ryoko yelled angrily as Alpha now also stepped out back, 
&quot;How many times do I have to tell you two vagrants to stop loitering?&quot;

&quot;Geez it, it&#39;s the heat!&quot; Edna cried as she grabbed Mildred&#39;s hand, 
&quot;C&#39;mon!&quot;

&quot;Right behind you, love!&quot; Mildred responded as the two raced off out of 
the alley and into the night.

Alpha tilted her head, visibly confused. &quot;Wow, I&#39;ve never seen anything 
like that before.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll get used to it,&quot; Ryoko responded as she crossed her arms, &quot;In a 
Shanejayell story, even the bag ladies are lesbians!&quot;</pre>
