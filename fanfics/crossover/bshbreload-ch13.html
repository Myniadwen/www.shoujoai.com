shadows, the pink haired vampire meeting the younger
blonde&#39;s eyes.

Nanami smiled slightly, her regal expression faintly
amused. &quot;But I didn&#39;t even ask for anything yet,&quot; she
said dryly.

&quot;She knows about us and the vampires,&quot; Anthy said as
the dusky skinned, purple haired girl continued with
some annoyance, &quot;and wants to help.&quot; She noted the
tension in Utena&#39;s body, the vibration of stressed
flesh, and for a moment wished she could soothe her
somehow...

&quot;This isn&#39;t just a vampire we&#39;re dealing with,&quot; Utena
sounded frustrated, &quot;she&#39;s....&quot;

&quot;Kanae Ohtori,&quot; Nanami said promptly, &quot;the daughter of
the school&#39;s head. She supposedly came here from
Europe, but I couldn&#39;t find any documentation on her
past a certain point. I did find evidence of a bloody
massacre at the last location she was at, however.&quot;

&quot;Sounds lovely,&quot; Anthy frowned.

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Juri agreed, the orange haired vampire
studying Nanami thoughtfully. &quot;Why did you research
her?&quot;

&quot;I talked to Miki,&quot; Nanami shrugged, &quot;once I
understood Akio was the vampire who started this,
looking into his fiancee seemed only logical.&quot;

&quot;Kanae is an elder vampire,&quot; Utena said patiently, &quot;I
have no idea what she might be capable of.&quot; Actually
her saying that Kanae was an elder vampire was just a
guess, but her ability to tolerate sunlight was
frightening to say the least.

&quot;She might also be the one ultimately responsible for
what happened to my brother,&quot; Nanami said with a quiet
sort of intensity. She looked up to boldly meet
Utena&#39;s eyes, &quot;I&#39;m going, even if I have to follow
you.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t that cute,&quot; Juri looked amused. &quot;another puppy
to follow Utena.&quot;

&quot;Utena...&quot; Anthy started.

&quot;No,&quot; Utena moved like a shot, her body a blur. Nanami
barely had a chance to gasp as Utena swept her into
her arms, looking down into those wide eyes.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Nanami squeaked.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Utena bet forward to kiss her neck, her
licking tongue bringing forth a startled moan from
Nanami. She sucked, bringing blood to the surface of
the smaller girl&#39;s skin, then bit firmly. Blood
gushed, spurting into Utena&#39;s mouth and she drank
hungrily, the fire spilling through her. Reluctantly
she pulled away a moment later, licking her lips as
she met the stunned girl&#39;s gaze, &quot;Sleep,&quot; she
commanded and Nanami slumped, out cold.

&quot;Are you sure that was the right thing to do?&quot; Anthy
asked as she, Utena and Juri left the old dorm as a
group, walking out into the darkness together.

&quot;No,&quot; Utena answered uncomfortably, thinking of the
young woman they had left with the slumbering Kozue,
&quot;but I won&#39;t let another innocent die, either.&quot;

&quot;And that&#39;s why you aren&#39;t bringing any of your
followers too,&quot; Anthy noted.

&quot;How noble of you,&quot; Juri sounded amused, striding
across the lawn like some kind of great cat. &#147;I need
to go do something,&#148; she said to Utena after a moment.

Utena looked at her questioningly, then a light seemed
to dawn behind her eyes. The pink haired girl nodded
as she said seriously, &#147;But be back soon, OK?&#148;

Without another word, Juri was gone, faded away into
the darkness. She raced across the nearly silent
campus, soon arriving at her own dorm. She slipped
inside the building like some kind of ghost, startling
Ruka. &#147;Juri, back home already?&#39; Ruka said, the blue
haired man clearly surprised to see her returning so
soon.

&#147;I&#39;m going back out,&#148; Juri answered him flatly. She
met his eyes with concern as she ordered, &#147;If I don&#39;t
return, take Shiori and flee Ohtori. It will be far
too dangerous for you to remain.&#148;

&#147;But,&#148; Ruka started to ask her, only to have her
disappear on him once again. &#147;Good luck, Juri,&#148; he
whispered.



Standing outside of the burnt out shell of a building
Utena could feel it, an icy shiver of cold running
into her very bones. She knew there were vampires
hiding here, lots of them. &#147;How many did you think you
saw?&#39; she asked Anthy quietly.

&#147;It was too dark to be sure,&#148; Anthy answered
regretfully. &#147;More than ten, at least,&#148; she sighed,
&quot;but other than that I just don&#39;t know.&quot; The stake in
her hand felt good, and she pulled another out to pass
to Utena, &quot;Here.&quot;

&#147;Thanks,&#148; Utena answered.

&#147;Gee, can I have one, too?&#148; Juri asked from right
behind them, her rich voice laden with pure amusement.

Anthy moved like a shot, spinning around and striking
so that the stake in her hand was suddenly poised
directly above Juri&#39;s vulnerable heart. The two of
them stood there motionless for a few moments, then
Anthy flipped the stake around, handing it to Juri
blunt end first.

&#147;Try not to hurt yourself with it,&#148; Anthy murmured.

Utena watched them and sighed, wondering if trying to
get these two to work together had been such a good
idea after all. &#147;Let&#39;s go,&#148; she said shortly, leading
them into the building. The first room was empty,
moonlight streaming in from the holes in the roof.

Anthy put her hand on the inner door, throwing a
glance back at the two vampires behind her as she
said, &#147;Be ready.&#148; She pulled the door open, and then
swiftly stepped back, giving Juri and Utena some room
to move.

Utena leapt forward, seeing the figure laying there
still and silent on the floor. `At least there&#39;s no
scent of spilled blood,&#39; she though to herself, a bit
relieved. Wakaba&#39;s chest rose and fell slowly, her
breathing that of someone fast asleep. Utena looked up
as Anthy and Juri walked in after her, and felt her
heart chill. The vampires Anthy had seen lined the
walls of the small room, all of them standing and
waiting for some reason.

&#147;Get Wakaba out of here,&#148; Utena told Anthy quietly.

&#147;Sorry, Utena,&#148; Juri noted as her eyes swept around
the room, &#147;but they&#39;re blocking the door out, too.&#148;

Anthy hefted her stake, looking at the young men that
were moving to surround them. &#147;I don&#39;t see any women
in here,&#148; she murmured softly.

Utena left Anthy kneeling down by Wakaba and stood,
looking around her calmly. &#147;Where is Kanae?&#148; she asked
the vampire boys grimly.

&#147;Right here,&#148; the woman&#39;s voice answered them. The
thin, green haired young woman languidly strolled out
into the center of the room, gazing at all of them
curiously before turning to Utena to ask, &#147;You&#39;re the
one, aren&#39;t you?&#148;

&#147;The one, what?&#148; Utena answered her. She noticed the
men shifting, spacing out so that they were evenly
spread around the four of them and braced herself for
battle.

&#147;The one who slew my Akio-sama,&#148; Kanae answered
levelly.

Utena silently signaled for the others to be ready as
she met Kanae&#39;s unnerving eyes and said, &#147;Yes, I was.&#148;

&#147;Die,&#148; Kanae hissed, and as one the vampires charged.

Juri swiftly grabbed one by the throat, driving the
stake home into it&#39;s heart and then turning to slay
another, then another. A vampire nearly managed to
jump her as she was occupied with a struggling one,
when Anthy drove a stake through it. &#147;Thank you,&#148; Juri
said to her with a smile.

&#147;Don&#39;t thank me. I did it for her,&#148; Anthy nodded
towards Utena, &#147;not you.&#148; She turned and threw a
stake, it cutting through the air to drive home into
another vampire. She killed them so efficiently,
simple and precise motions that ended vampires.

Utena stopped another vampire lunging for the sleeping
Wakaba and staked him coldly. Again and again the
vampire boys fell, dropping like flies around them as
the three of them efficiently dealt the final death to
them. And in the background, Kanae waited.

The final vampire fell, and Kanae still stood there
silently watching them, looking almost like a statue
in the murky room. &#147;What is she waiting for?&#148; Juri
hissed angrily.

Almost as if she had been waiting for that cue, Kanae
was suddenly just a blur, picking up Anthy and then
casting her up hard against the wall. The girl barely
had a chance to cry out in surprise before she made a
wet thump as she hit, falling silent to the ground.

&#147;Anthy!&#148; Utena cried out.

Juri barely even got her guard up when Kanae was upon
her as well. Their eyes met in a silent battle of
wills, both of them standing rigidly still. Juri bit
her bottom lip, a sluggish trickle of blood running
down from the corner of her mouth as they fought on
silently. Then, her eyes rolled up in her head and she
slumped to the ground bonelessly.

&#147;Alone at last,&#148; Kanae murmured with amusement.

Utena stood and faced her, meeting the green haired
girl&#39;s eyes with her own blue ones. &#147;Do your worst,&#148;
Utena invited her calmly.

&#147;I intend to,&#148; Kanae answered.

The air in the room itself seemed to dance with an
electric charge as they gazed at each other. Their
wills clashed like swords, invisibly tangling in the
air between them. Neither of them moved or swayed for
long minutes, still like statues.

&#147;Is that... all you&#39;ve got?&#148; Utena managed to ask.

&#147;It can&#39;t be,&#148; Kanae finally murmured after a moment.
She looked at Utena in an expression of wonder, her
eyes wide, &#147;I cannot break your will.&#148; A slight smile
touched her lips, &#147;I&#39;ve finally found someone worthy.&#148;

&#147;Worthy?&#148; Utena asked, hefting the stake in her hand.

&#147;To face me in battle, of course,&#148; Kanae smiled, and
charged. She was fast, unearthly so, but Utena made
herself match her speed and met her blow for blow.
Fangs gleaming, they leapt around the little room,
meeting with savage force.

`Anthy might be dying,&#39; Utena thought grimly, `I have
to...&#39;

&#147;Distracted,&#148; Kanae smiled at her coldly, hammering
Utena down to the ground with a single massive blow of
a hand.

Kanae watched curiously as Utena lay on the floor. She
forced herself up to her knees and spat out some
blood, feeling something inside her torn and broken.
`If I don&#39;t win,&#39; she realized, `we are all dead.&#39; She
rose on shaky legs, then stood up, ready to face her
again.

A warmer smile came from Kanae as she purred, &#147;Your
will is impressive.&#148; Kanae met Utena&#39;s eyes, trying to
compel her with her will, &#147;Serving me would be so much
easier, Utena. Give in,&#148; she looked over to where
Anthy lay, &#147;and I&#39;ll give her to you as your reward.&#148;

Something seemed to happen behind Utena&#39;s eyes, almost
like a switch being thrown. &#147;She&#39;s not yours to give,&#148;
she snarled, and attacked with a new fury.

Kanae tried to defend herself, avoiding and blocking
some of Utena&#39;s blows, but found herself giving up
ground again and again. `That&#39;s it,&#148; Kanae oddly
murmured. Loudly, &#147;I&#39;ll kill her, Utena! I&#39;ll kill
them all if you let me!&#148;

&#147;No,&#148; Utena growled out, a feral side of her nature
now fully unleashed. Again and again she attacked,
bones breaking and flesh tearing as Kanae suffered
under strike under strike.

Kanae met Utena&#39;s eyes, and she was startled by the
clarity that was now visible in Kanae&#39;s eyes. &#147;Thank
you,&#148; she murmured, then charged right at Utena at top
speed. Utena raised the stake in her hand
automatically, and Kanae skewered herself on it
deliberately.

&#147;Why?&#148; Utena managed to gasp out as she suddenly took
Kanae&#39;s weight, easing her down to the damp floor.

&#147;I never wanted this life,&#148; Kanae said to her softly,
&#147;I&#39;m glad it&#39;s finally over.&#148; She slumped to the
floor, the life flowing right out of her.

Utena looked down at her in surprise, then she
remembered she had other things to deal with. &#147;Anthy,&#148;
she said her name, shaking her gently.

&#147;Utena,&#148; Anthy smiled at her weekly. Blood soaked the
front of her uniform, and Utena realized that Kanae
had ripped the girl&#39;s throat out even as she threw
her. &#147;I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t more help,&#148; she managed, then
faded out.

&#147;Don&#39;t you dare die on me,&#148; Utena cried out, but it
was useless. She looked around her wildly, then her
eyes fixed on the stunned Juri, and a forbidden idea
suddenly occurred to her. `Anthy may not forgive me,&#39;
Utena thought, `but I don&#39;t care.&#39;

&#147;Utena?&#148; Juri managed as Utena shook her awake.

&#147;I need you to turn Anthy,&#148; Utena said intensely.

&#147;What?&#148; Juri blinked at her in surprise.</pre>
