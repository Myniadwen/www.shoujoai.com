Miyabi smiled happily as the formally dressed redhead
swayed closely with the lovely younger blonde out on
the dance floor. &quot;Thank you for coming here with me
tonight,&quot; she said softly, gently holding her close.

&quot;My pleasure,&quot; Tina Foster answered softly, snuggling
close to her. She looked up at Miyabi, &quot;How long were
you going to wait to tell me?&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t going to be able to hold out very much
longer,&quot; Miyabi admitted with a wry smile. She gave
Tina a faintly scolding look, &quot;Especially with you
running around in those tight tops and short shorts.&quot;

&quot;Why do you think I was wearing them?&quot; Tina asked
impishly, running her hands over Miyabi&#39;s back.

&quot;You little minx,&quot; Miyabi muttered in surprise.

Tina lay her head on Miyabi&#39;s shoulder, savoring the
taller woman&#39;s sweet presence. &quot;You weren&#39;t noticing
me otherwise,&quot; she purred.

&quot;Oh I was noticing,&quot; Miyabi said a bit ruefully as she
held Tina close, &quot;I was just too terrified to do
anything about it.&quot;

Tina looked up, stroking Miyabi&#39;s cheek with one hand.
&quot;You don&#39;t need to be afraid of me,&quot; she murmured,
drawing her down into a kiss.

&quot;I&#39;ll be damned,&quot; Ryouko murmured from where she
handled the bar, the blue haired space pirate looking
amused, &quot;I figured her for a closet case.&quot;

&quot;You think?&quot; Minagi asked with a grin, watching the
two women nearly making out on the dance floor. She
cheek scars and mildly gentler eyes were the only
difference between her and her twin Ryouko.. that, and
the lip print still on her cheek.

&quot;From the way she acted on her last visit,&quot; Ryouko
shrugged casually. She finally had to point out the
mark on Minagi&#39;s cheek, &quot;Either Sasami&#39;s getting
affectionate or you&#39;ve got a girlfriend on the side.&quot;

&quot;Eep,&quot; Minagi blushed, rubbing at her cheek. &quot;I went
back to visit Sasami,&quot; she confessed, &quot;and we got a
bit carried away.&quot;

Ryouko grinned rakishly, &quot;Trust me, I know how that
feels. I intend to haul Ayeka into a back room later
and ravage her.&quot; She noticed a familiar woman waving
up the bar and excused herself, &quot;Gotta go.&quot;

&quot;Two cans of beer, please,&quot; Ritsuko Akagi smiled, the
blonde scientist leaning casually against the counter.
Her white labcoat fluttered over her simple uniform
and her manner surprisingly relaxed as she turned to
her companion.

Misato Katsuragi grinned, &quot;Thanks love.&quot; She put her
hand over Ritsuko&#39;s, squeezing gently, &quot;I hope no one
gave you trouble over the roses I sent over to your
lab.&quot;

&quot;No, though I think Maya is feeling a bit jealous of
my good fortune,&quot; Ritsuko answered her with amusement.

Misato had some suspicions over what Maya was really
jealous about, but she firmly kept her mouth shut. &quot;I
have a surprise waiting at home for you, too,&quot; she
added softly.

&quot;Ooh,&quot; Ritsuko&#39;s eyes lit up. &quot;Too bad we have
Shinji-chan living with us now,&quot; she purred, &quot;I
remember how we spent last Valentine&#39;s day.&quot;

&quot;Still,&quot; Misato let a finger stroke along Ritsuko&#39;s
collar, &quot;getting the spilled chocolate syrup out of
the living room carpet was tough.&quot;

&quot;Worth it, though,&quot; Ritsuko answered, kissing her
gently.

Keiko fought back a smile, the boyish brown haired
woman fighting back a blush over listening in. She
moved over to where a regular was sitting at one of
the tables, then over to where girl-type Ranma and her
harem were eating together. Finally she spotted two
women sitting at the corner table and headed over to
see if they needed anything.

Both were younger than average, one with blue hair
verging on black and the other with brown, her eyes
the most unusual shade of red. &quot;Is there anything I
can get you?&quot; Keiko asked them brightly. A second&#39;s
pause, &quot;Though I can&#39;t bring you alcohol without
identification.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; the dark blue haired girl smiled faintly
before looking over at her companion questioningly,
&quot;Shiziru?&quot;

&quot;You pick Natsuki,&quot; Shiziru answered, her red eyes
surprisingly gentle, &quot;I trust you.&quot;

Natsuki smiled back, meeting her eyes for a long
moment, &quot;Thanks.&quot; Turning back towards Keiko she
briskly ordered two of the lunch specials and sodas
for them both.

&quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; Keiko bowed before bouncing off.

&quot;I was a little surprised that you knew about a club
like this,&quot; Natsuki murmured to Shiziru after Keiko
dropped their meals off.

Shiziru smiled faintly, &quot;I have to confess I phoned a
information line, actually.&quot; She looked amused, &quot;So
how did Mai take hearing about us?&quot;

Natsuki looked more amused than anything else, &quot;I
don&#39;t think she was terribly surprised, really.
Especially after how you behaved at that picnic she
and Yuichi were having.&quot;

Shiziru took a small drink of her soda, &quot;Sorry love.&quot;
Her eyes twinkled merrily, &quot;I just have a hard time
with self control around you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m so damn shy about it all,&quot; Natsuki
confessed softly. She was still felt awkward about her
and Shiziru showing their affections in public,
despite how strongly she might feel about the other
woman.

Shiziru flashed a smile as she reached out to gently
squeeze Natsuki&#39;s hand. &quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; she said
warmly, &quot;in fact I think your blushing makes you look
cuter.&quot;

Natsuki blushed, &quot;Shiziru!&quot; Deciding it was best to
change the subject a little she asked, &quot;Were you
serious about staying in school to be with me?&quot;

&quot;Not quite the way you think,&quot; Shiziru smiled gently,
&quot;Fuka offers advanced courses in preparation for
university as well as some courses at that level. It
won&#39;t hurt and may help me quite a bit, so don&#39;t feel
guilty.&quot;

Natsuki smiled faintly, &quot;And here I was preparing to
argue with you.&quot;

&quot;Never,&quot; Shiziru chucked, her eyes warmly
affectionate.

Arisugawa Juri felt a certain degree of amusement as
she checked in with May, glad to see a mix of old and
new faces in the crowds. &quot;How are we doing?&quot; the
orange haired beauty asked, her simple black tuxedo
hugging her body.

&quot;Busy, but that&#39;s normal for today,&quot; May chuckled, her
brown hair bouncing on the back of her maid&#39;s uniform.
The cyberdoll looked at Juri curiously, &quot;Is Setsuna
coming in today?&quot;

&quot;Actually I&#39;m taking her out to dinner afterward,&quot;
Juri admitted with a grin, &quot;then home to bed...
eventually.&quot;

May blushed cutely, &quot;Keiko&#39;s promisingly me much the
same.&quot;

Juri chuckled softly. &quot;Remind everyone that I&#39;m
closing the Locket for tomorrow,&quot; she said, &quot;so they
can take a day off with their sweeties.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got a notice up in the back,&quot; May nodded, &quot;and I
think I&#39;ve told all them, too.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Juri nodded, &quot;then I&#39;d better mingle for a
bit.&quot; A grin, &quot;I hope you and Keiko have a good time
tonight!&quot;

Sitting on a couch by the library Alpha was taking a
break, the green haired android smiling sweetly at her
companion. &quot;I was so glad to see you here,&quot; she said
happily, reaching out to gently take her hand.

Kokone smiled back, the pink haired android squeezing
her fingers. &quot;Your last letter mentioned you were
working in a club,&quot; she answered, &quot;I wanted to be sure
you were all right.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s really different than the cafe,&quot; Alpha admitted,
&quot;but it&#39;s interesting.&quot; She looked up to meet Kokone&#39;s
eyes, &quot;I missed you.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Kokone admitted with a blush, her hand
gently stroking Alpha&#39;s.
