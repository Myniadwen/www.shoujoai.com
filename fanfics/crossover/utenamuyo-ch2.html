<h1>Utena Muyo! or No Need for Utena! (part 2 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/utenamuyo-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Miki looked down at the script wide eyed. &quot;Look, I know I volunteered 
to help build the sets,&quot; he whimpered softly, &quot;but building a set for 
Tsunami?&quot; He slapped the script on to the table, &quot;And Ryo-Ohki? What&#39;s 
a Ryo-Ohki?&quot;

&quot;But Miki-kun,&quot; Nanami batted her eyes at him as she looked up at him 
and said sweetly, &quot;Anthy will be there.&quot;

A pause, and Miki gulped before saying, &quot;Anthy?&quot;

Keiko nodded cheerfully, &quot;Yes, she&#39;s be playing Ayeka.&quot; She smiled, 
&quot;And I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be very impressed with you if you do this.&quot;

Miki looked down at the script with a sigh, picked it up, and wandered 
off muttering softly, &quot;I&#39;ll get to it then.&quot;

Once he was gone Nanami said under her breath, &quot;He is so whipped.&quot; Her 
three cronies solemnly nodded their agreement.

There was a soft knock on the door, and Shiori came in, pulling a 
sniffling Wakaba behind her. &quot;I can&#39;t work with her,&quot; she ranted, 
&quot;she&#39;s such a klutz!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why she&#39;s perfect for Mihoshi,&quot; Keiko beamed.

&quot;See? I&#39;m perfect,&quot; Wakaba boasted, making poor Shiori sweatdrop.
Juri lay back on the stone bench, pretending that she was laying on a 
bed. She smiled seductively up at Utena, &quot;Welcome home, Tenchi.&quot;

Utena gulped visibly, clapped her hands together, and mimed praying.

&quot;Well done, Utena-sama!&quot; Anthy exclaimed.

Utena winced visibly, &quot;That again.&quot;

&quot;Chu!&quot; Chu-chu exclaimed.

&quot;No,&quot; Anthy knelt down to the little mouse, &quot;you need to go, Myah!&quot;

&quot;Myah?&quot; Chu-chu managed in his Ryo-Ohki costume.

Juri smoothly got up, &quot;I guess that&#39;s enough for now.&quot; Juri looked 
over at the blushing Utena, &#39;She&#39;s kind of cute that way.&#39;

Anthy smiled and bowed, &quot;I enjoyed out scene together.&quot;

Utena sweatdropped as she squeaked out, &quot;What, where Ayeka&#39;s torturing 
Ryouko and she ends up enjoying it?&quot;

&quot;Hai,&quot; Anthy beamed.

Juri chuckled softly, and in a singsong sort of voice quoted Ryouko&#39;s 
line, &quot;Actually, I&#39;m more of a sadist.&quot;

Utena blushed furiously. Under her breath she muttered, &quot;Who on Earth 
picked out this to be a school play, anyway?&quot;

Nanami, strangely, sneezed for no reason.

&quot;Bless you,&quot; Touga remarked absentmindedly.

&quot;Big brother,&quot; Nanami sighed, large throbbing hearts appearing in her 
eyes.

Touga sighed, and left the lunch table.

&quot;I&#39;m the greatest scientific genius in the universe,&quot; Nanami practiced 
her line while on her way back to classes, startling random passerby. 
&quot;Hmm, not quite mad enough,&quot; she muttered to herself softly.

&quot;Mad angry?&quot; the voice asked.

&quot;No, mad insane,&quot; she muttered softly, then suddenly stopped. &#39;Who 
said that?&#39; she looked all around her, but saw nothing but two shadows 
against a wall. She sweatdropped, shook her head, and walked off.

Once she was gone, Shadowplay girl A-ko muttered, &quot;I want to be in the 
play!&quot;

Shadowplay girl B-ko patted her on the shoulder, &quot;But there&#39;s no way.&quot;
Miki looked in shock at his set building crew. &quot;How did they talk you 
all into doing this?&quot; he asked, wide eyed.

Touga glared at him as if it was all his fault, &quot;My darling sister 
Nanami said she&#39;s tell my next date I have an STD.&quot;

&quot;Keiko has taken the precious exchange diary I share with my darling 
Anthy,&quot; Saionji muttered, &quot;and will not return it unless I help you.&quot; 
He stood up straight and pointed to the sky as he loudly declared, 
&quot;Anthy, I love you!&quot;

&quot;You keep an exchange diary?&quot; Miki sweatdropped.

&quot;My reasons for being here are my own,&quot; Akio sniffed.

&quot;Anthy quivered her chin and cried at you, didn&#39;t she?&quot; Touga asked.

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Akio admitted.

&quot;Well, lets get to work,&quot; Miki sighed.

&quot;Work?!&quot; all three men exclaimed, and Miki sweatdropped visibly.
