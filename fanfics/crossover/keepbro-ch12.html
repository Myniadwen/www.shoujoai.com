<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/keepbro-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Ash, May, Misty, Kari, Brock, Miyu, Chisato, Himeno, Mawata, Davis, 
Willis and Richie where all hanging round outside flat buildings at 
11:00 at night they all seemed to have a good time. 

&quot;Hey guys&quot; Ash shouted out. &quot; I got something to tell you&quot; 

&quot;Okay guys&quot; Davis boomed in Grinal&#39;s voice while holding a can of beer &quot; 
we&#39;re all silent for Ash&quot; 

&quot;Oh shut up Grinal&quot; Kari replied 

&quot;We already know this bit Ash&quot; Misty moaned holding Vodka. 

&quot;Only you and Kari know this&quot; Ash replied, &quot;It&#39;s got something to do 
with May,&quot; 

Then Willis took a quick but accurate look at May then pointed at Ash 
knowing what he was going to say &quot;May&#39;s pregnant with ya kid&quot; 

&quot;Yeah!&quot; Ash replied &quot;that was what I was gonna say.&quot; 

Chisato and Himeno dashed over to May in an exited way, 

&quot;Oh my God you&#39;re pregnant,&quot; Chisato screamed out 

&quot; How long have you been pregnant for?&quot; Himeno screeched out 

&quot;I don&#39;t have a clue&quot; May replied giggling 

&quot;They&#39;ve been having lots of it&quot; Richie shouted out, &quot; Sparky and I can 
here you from the ground floor doing your humping business&quot; 

&quot;Well&quot; Willis started &quot; May looks about four or five months pregnant to 
me&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s as skinny as a rake,&quot; Davis shouted out. 

&quot;Well her breasts are really huge.&quot; Willis explained 

&quot;YOU PERVERT&quot; Davis shouted out 

&quot;Just let me explain&quot; Willis complained. &quot;Like I said her tits are 
humongous and the way she dresses makes her look very skinny, any way 
during pregnancy tits get bigger, plus they get bigger when you 
breastfeed if you choose to do so, pile on the pounds a bit but hey this 
means...&quot; then Willis went over to Ash and said &quot;...Ash, you are one 
hell of a lucky guy&quot; 

&quot;Willis you&#39;re a pervert&quot; Davis shouted out. 

&quot;EVERY ONE!&quot; Richie shouted out &quot;WILLIS IS A PERVERT! HE LOVES BIG 
BOOBS&quot; 

&quot;ABOUT 55MM THE MINIMUM&quot; Davis shouted out 

The crowds bursted with laughter AS Chisato and Himeno tried to ask May 
what was her fashion secrets. 

Meanwhile at a hotel near where the gang was hanging about from Gary and 
Jun where in a their room as they could still hear the racket they are 
making. Jun wearing nothing but her underwear dangerously had her arm 
round Gary. 

&quot;You are so handsome Gary&quot; Jun laughed 

&quot;And you are so getting so getting my nerve&quot; Gary replied pushing Jun 
away 

&quot;Hey&quot; Jun hissed, &quot;What&#39;s gone over you&quot; Jun asked as she walked to Gary 
who had his back to her. 

&quot;Tasha&quot; Gary replied, &quot; She&#39;s been on my mind a lot. &quot;How I&#39;m hurting 
her.&quot; 

&quot;For gods sake Gary&quot; Jun replied placing her arm over him, he didn&#39;t 
look at her &quot;soon we&#39;ll be away from your wife, not even the press can 
see you, ya can marry me&quot; 

&quot;A marriage is based on love and trust&quot; Gary replied &quot;and that&#39;s how I 
feel about Tasha&quot; 

&quot;You can&#39;t trust me&quot; Jun snapped. 

&quot;No&quot; Gary stubbornly snapped 

&quot;Why not&quot; Jun begged shedding a tear 

Gary slowly turned his head to face Jun, &quot;Because...you slept with my 
cousin&quot; 

&quot;What Matt,&quot; Jun replied, &quot; that was just a one night stands&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t think I can trust you now&quot; Gary replied 

&quot;Hey&quot; Jun hissed as she put her clothes back on &quot; I&#39;ve found a place, 
you said you needed to get away and you said you love me&quot; 

&quot;Oh fuck off&quot; Gary spat as he pushed Jun to the window pulling the 
window curtain away. Jun cried. She stood up, 

&quot;I done all this for you&quot; she cried &quot;and you throw it all back at me in 
the face&quot; 

Gary came over; he was crap at handling with crying girls. 

&quot;Hey&quot; Gary replied holding Jun&#39;s hand &quot;I&#39;m just stress out for the 
minute, being married to a monarch is not as easy as its portrayed in 
the paparazzi, when you&#39;ve found a place ring me&quot; 

Gary placed his hands on hers and kissed passionately out the window 
ignoring the noise. 

They where both unaware, that Ash and May could see them out the window 
while their drunken friends continued to muck about.&nbsp;

Then two police women in a van that just pulled over and got out of the 
van near where the gang where. 

&quot; Well&quot; Davis shouted out &quot; it&#39;s the famous police duo Natsumi and 
Miyuki&quot; 

&quot;SEXY&quot; shouted out Richie. 

&quot;Ok &quot; Miyuki announced, &quot;You&#39;re all under arrest&quot; 

&quot; That includes you two as well Ash and May&quot; Natsumi replied. 

&quot;What for?&quot; Davis shouted out &quot;we&#39;re just kids trying to have a good 
time&quot;&nbsp;

Misty and Kari ran escaped and quietly ran away. 

&quot;For disturbing the peace,&quot; Natsumi replied, &quot;Under-age drinking is 
well&quot; 

&quot;Ok&quot; Miyuki &quot; every one in the car I&#39;m taking you home with a warning 
this time do it again and you&#39;ll be in prison&quot; 

&quot;Yes miss&quot; they all replied apart from May.&nbsp;Who felt queasy that was the 
reason why thy where always late for morning registration at school, she 
imploded on the car floor Ash luckily halted her and laid her on his 
shoulder, 

&quot;Are you okay May?&quot; Ash whispered 

&quot;Hope that didn&#39;t hurt the baby&quot; May replied 

Natsumi and Miyuki closed the door straight way then drove to the 
ambulance. Natsumi opened the van door helped Ash get May out of the van 
when they where both out Natsumi closed the door tight so no one else 
could escape.
