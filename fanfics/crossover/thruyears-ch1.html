<h1>Through the Years (part 1 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ecoldiron.html">Elwin Blain Coldiron</a><br> </h2>
<pre>AUTHOR&#39;S NOTES &#150; This will be a first for me. It will be the first time 
that I have stepped outside the world of Tenchi Muyo! fanfiction (my 
usual forte) to write a primarily Hellsing fanfiction, as well as making 
it a crossover with Gunsmith Cats.

The Hellsing element of this story will be a fusion of sorts. I&#39;m 
adapting some elements of the Hellsing OVA in an alternate universe, 
with a little bit of the television series thrown in to keep it 
interesting... plus some changes in order to make some parts of the 
story fit. If I seem to be drifting away from the core elements of both 
stories, I would appreciate you letting me know so that I can keep it 
straight.

P.S. I&#39;m seriously thinking about making this a three-way yuri/shoujo-ai 
relationship between Sir Integra, Seras and Rally. Let me know what you 
think... in other words, R&amp;R!

PRELUDE - A COMMAND CENTER OUTSIDE JOLIET, ILLINOIS...

The scene was quite hectic at the hastily-constructed tent city near a 
farm, the morning sun gradually coming up on the horizon. A combination 
of HAZ-MAT workers along with armed soldiers raced between tents, 
receiving assignments, then dispersing to them. A lot of the activity 
centered around a larger tent, which was set in-between the assortment 
of decontamination showers.

Outside the encampment, a Rolls-Royce drove up to the gate. The guard 
approached the driver, then was shown identification papers, afterwhich 
he waved the car through. The Rolls then drove up to the main tent, 
whereas a well-dressed and distinguished gentleman exited the rear door 
and proceeded to the entrance.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; an individual, obviously a National Guard general, called 
out at the gentleman, &quot;but only authorized personnel are allowed in 
here.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s quite alright, General. I have the proper credentials right 
here.&quot; The gentleman produced a series of documents to an aide, who then 
handed them to the general.

The general perused the documents, then satisfied that they were in 
order, addresses the gentleman. &quot;So... Sir Hugh Islands, what can we do 
for you?&quot;

Sir Islands assessed the situation inside the tent, then said, &quot;I was 
contacted by my contacts within your Homeland Security department and 
was told that a situation was occurring here. Might I inquire as to what 
is going on?&quot;

Feeling a little flustered that an outsider... an outsider that was a 
foreign national, knew about such a sensitive situation, the general 
address Sir Islands with, &quot;Well, whatever you&#39;ve been told, I can assure 
you that we have thing well taken care of. Now if you&#39;ll kindly...&quot;

&quot;Well taken care of, is it?&quot; Sir Islands interrupted, sounding offended. 
&quot;Well, from what I&#39;ve observed, it seems to be more of a combat 
situation rather than a chemical leak as the public was led on to 
believe. Now, could you kindly drop the pretenses and give me what 
REALLY is transpiring... or do I have to contact your President and go 
over your head to do it? Mind you, I have interrupted my holiday in your 
country when my contacts told me of what happened. I would appreciate a 
straight answer.&quot;

Finally admitting defeat, the general sighed and said, &quot;Very well. 
Twelve hours ago, several members of D.E.A. and the Illinois State 
Patrol approached the farmhouse we&#39;re surrounding in order to serve a 
search warrant on suspicion that a meth-lab was being operated on the 
premises. As the warrant was being served, the officers and the D.E.A. 
officials were attacked and killed. As a result, several members of the 
I.S.P.&#39;s Special Weapons and Tactics were dispatched and attacked as 
well... and were killed, strangely enough by the officers called to 
serve the warrant.&quot;

Sir Islands took all this in, all the well nodding. When the general 
finished, he looked at him and said, &quot;Well... this is just as we 
suspected. Very well, have your men pull back at least two kilometers 
from this spot.&quot;

&quot;NOW WAIT A MINUTE...&quot; the general yelled.

&quot;Afterwhich, the aid your State Department requested from the British 
government will deal with this matter right away.&quot; Sensing the general&#39;s 
growing hostility, Sir Islands changed the tone of his speech. &quot;General, 
I sympathize with your situation, but the fact remains that your men are 
ill-equipped to handle what is transpiring in that house. If you charge 
into there with guns blazing, you will only compound what is happening 
by creating more of those creatures. Now the sun is coming up, so at 
least we have some time before they arrive. I suggest you have your men 
set up a perimeter around the farmhouse, mostly to keep innocent people 
out, but also as a fall-back position in case something goes wrong.&quot; He 
then presented the general with additional papers. &quot;These are 
authorizations by your superiors to allow representatives from my 
government to act on behalf and the benefit of the United States of 
America, the trusted allies of Her Majesty.&quot;

Still fuming, the general took the papers and thumbed through them. 
Finally calming down, he looked at Sir Islands and replied, 
&quot;Everything&#39;s in order, so I guess that your government may proceed.&quot; He 
still looked irritated as he continued, &quot;This is so galling... to have 
the rug pulled-out from under you. We&#39;ve could&#39;ve handled it, you know.&quot;

&quot;If you knew what I knew... and do not worry, you will be briefed about 
it,&quot; Sir Islands said, &quot;then I believe you would reassess that claim.&quot;

O&#39;HARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, CHICAGO, SIX HOURS LATER...

Captain Kevin Delany stood on the tarmac of the cargo terminal, waiting 
for the incoming flight to stop and offload... whatever he was called to 
observe. He hated these milk-runs and thought he had better things to do 
right now. However, the higher-ups in Chicago P.D. thought it would be a 
good idea to observe this international flight that had just came in 
from St. John&#39;s.

&quot;Kevin! How&#39;s it going?&quot; a voice called out from behind. Delany turned 
to see Lieutenant Roy Coleman walk up behind him.

&quot;Roy. I thought you be off by now,&quot; Delany said.

&quot;I would be, but Lt. Francis got notified about a domestic dispute and I 
was called to fill in for him.&quot; He then looked at the huge cargo jet 
coming to a full stop. &quot;Excuse me... but is that an R.A.F. plane?&quot; 
Coleman pointed out on the livery of the jet, which bore the markings of 
the British Royal Air Force.

&quot;Yeah. They made a fueling stop-over in St. John&#39;s in Newfoundland 
before coming here,&quot; Delany answered as the rear door dropped on the 
jet. &quot;I wonder what the hell the Brits are doing here?&quot;

As Delany continued to muse, a flatbed carrier then exited the jet, 
carrying on its back two rather large crates, both of them had what 
appeared to be red-and-black shields on their sides. Delany leaned over 
to get a look at the writing on the shields, &quot;&#39;Hellsing?&#39; &#39;We&#39;re on a 
mission from God&#39;? What the heck is this, some international bible sales 
persons that dragged a military transport to do their work?&quot; he rasped 
irritably. He waved over a guard, then asked him, &quot;What the heck are in 
these things anyway?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t know,&quot; the soldier said. &quot;I&#39;m only here to guard the cargo.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Delany grumbled. &quot;Well if you don&#39;t mind, I would like to have 
a look at those? Is that allowable?&quot;

&quot;It is NOT,&quot; another voice &#150; a woman&#39;s &#150; called out from behind. Both 
men turn around to see what appeared to be a woman in a gray-green men&#39;s 
business suit... and wearing an unusual tie with a silver crucifix in 
the center of it. She had pale blonde hair, blue eyes with glasses on 
them, ruddy skin, and had an unlit cigar in her mouth. &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; she 
began in a British-sounding voice, &quot;those packages are top-secret... so 
I would thank you not to open them.&quot;

Delany glowered at the woman. &quot;Pardon me, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s any 
of your business, Miss...&quot;

&quot;The name is Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, Detective. And 
yes, it is MY business... and none of yours.&quot;

Coleman didn&#39;t like the looks of what was happening. A seasoned veteran, 
he could recognize the growing rage within Delany. Coleman knew that 
Delany&#39;s temper often resulted in brutality charges against the 
department, which kept Internal Affairs busy trying to investigate them. 
&quot;Kevin,&quot; he began, &quot;you really shouldn&#39;t be going at her. We&#39;re still 
trying to clean up the last mess you...&quot;

&quot;NONE OF MY BUSINESS!?!?&quot; Delany roared. &quot;LISTEN TO ME, YOU LIMEY BITCH, 
THE SAFETY OF THIS CITY IS MY BUSINESS!! NOW LET ME GET A LOOK AT THOSE 
CRATES BEFORE...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve been outvoted on that matter, Detective,&quot; a new 
figure said, walking up and standing beside Sir Integra. He then flashed 
a badge at the two and said, &quot;Harold Lewis, Homeland Security. The 
Federal Government has a crisis at hand. And since Sir Integra possesses 
the only means to stop it, the President asked the Queen herself to 
enlist her organization&#39;s help. Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, we&#39;ll take 
possession from here.&quot;

Delany glared at Sir Integra hostilely, for which the former had a smug 
look at the detective as she walked off. &quot;Why you little...&quot; he growled 
as he began to charge her, only to have Coleman hold him back from 
behind.

&quot;KEVIN!! DON&#39;T DO IT!!! YOU&#39;LL ONLY HAVE INTERNAL AFFAIRS ALL OVER YOUR 
ASS AGAIN!!!&quot; Coleman yelled as he struggled to reign Delany in.

&quot;IT&#39;LL BE WORTH IT, NOW LET ME GO, ROY!!!&quot; Delany shot back, but 
Coleman, as well as other C.P.D. officers, continued to hold him back.

While this was going on, the Homeland Security official glanced over to 
Sir Integra and whispered, &quot;I do apologize for that outburst. I assure 
you that he is NOT the norm of police in this country.&quot;

&quot;There is nothing to apologize for, Mr. Lewis,&quot; Sir Integra. &quot;I just did 
not want those crates opened prematurely, that is all.&quot; They went on to 
where the crates were loaded onto an Army truck, which was supervised by 
what appeared to be an elderly black-haired gentleman. &quot;Walter, have the 
crates been secured?&quot;

The gentleman &#150; Walter C. Dolnez &#150; turned to Sir Integra and replied, 
&quot;They have, Sir Integra. It will be a few minutes before we can depart.&quot;

&quot;Make sure everything is ready when we deploy near Joliet,&quot; the 
pale-haired woman said. &quot;You will accompany them to the departure site, 
then notify me when ready.&quot;

&quot;Indeed I shall,&quot; Walter said, then directed the soldiers loading the 
crates to be cautious about a refrigerated cooler that went with the 
crates, as well as several large cases.

Lewis and Sir Integra then proceeded to a waiting car, where they got in 
to proceed out. Looking back at the two detectives, which Delany 
appeared to have calmed down, Sir Integra turned to Lewis and said, 
&quot;Kevin was his name, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

Lewis looked at a profile of Delany and nodded. &quot;Miracle he&#39;s still 
working for Chicago P.D., with all the brutality complaints on him. 
Whenever Delany gets his Irish up, it can only mean trouble.&quot;

Sir Integra nodded silently as the car started up. However, her brow 
furrowed as she thought, &#39;Irish... that usually means a Catholic, if I 
read the demographics of this area correctly. That could be trouble if 
word of our involvement got out.&#39;

LATE AFTERNOON...

&quot;You&#39;re kidding, Roy?&quot; Irene &quot;Rally&quot; Vincent said, sitting in the living 
room. &quot;You actually had to rope in &#39;Bruiser&#39; Delany?&quot; She, along with 
&#39;Minnie&#39; May Hopkins, blonde-haired explosives expert, sat on the couch 
in the house the two shared and chatted with Coleman. Also present was 
Becky &#39;the Nose&#39; Farrah, information expert. The four of them sat near a 
coffee table, enjoying take-out pizza while discussing the events which 
delayed Coleman from visiting.

&quot;No shit, Rally,&quot; Coleman said, who leaned back on the chair offered. 
&quot;He wanted to jump in and pound those two to a pulp. It took us a while 
to calm him down.&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s one way to prevent an international incident, isn&#39;t it?&quot; 
Becky said between bitefulls of pizza. &quot;Do you think this has anything 
to do with that chemical spill near Joliet?&quot;

&quot;Now wait a minute,&quot; May offered up, &quot;since when does an agent from 
Homeland Security accompany a British expert on a simple chemical spill? 
We&#39;ve got HAZ-MAT people who can handle it here.&quot;

&quot;Now that you&#39;ve mentioned it,&quot; Rally said, scratching her chin, &quot;it 
does seem odd that Homeland Security would get involved in a spill.&quot; She 
looked at Coleman and said, &quot;Roy, do you think that terrorists might be 
involved?&quot;

&quot;Possibly,&quot; Coleman offered, &quot;which would explain the chemical spill 
story... and the foreign help.&quot;

&quot;If it is,&quot; Becky added, &quot;it would explain why they would cover-up such 
a thing... mainly to avoid a panic.&quot; She then looked at Rally and 
growled, &quot;And speaking of cover-ups, are you still covering up the fact 
that you still owe me $300 for that last favor you wanted me to help you 
with?&quot;

Rally sweatdropped as she look at Becky. &quot;Oh... that,&quot; she sputtered. 
&quot;Well... I&#39;m... still waiting for the money from the bondsman, that&#39;s 
all.&quot;

&quot;I bet,&quot; Becky grumbled, not sounding convinced.

&quot;Becky, she&#39;s telling the truth!&quot; May said. &quot;The bondsman&#39;s going 
through the paperwork so that he can pay Rally.&quot; Returning to Coleman, 
she added, &quot;Did you ever get that British woman&#39;s name, Roy?&quot;

&quot;Just a little, mostly her last name,&quot; Coleman said. &quot;For some reason, 
that name sounds familiar. I think it was... Hellsing.&quot;

&quot;Hellsing?&quot; Rally gasped, a look of recognition on her face. She then 
leaned over to Coleman and asked, &quot;Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, 
am I right, Roy?&quot;

Coleman nodded, a little surprised at Rally&#39;s reaction. &quot;That&#39;s right... 
but how did you know that?&quot; Rally didn&#39;t immedietly answer. Instead, she 
headed upstairs. &quot;What was that all about?&quot; Coleman asked.

&quot;I&#39;m just as in the dark as you are, Roy,&quot; May answered.

Rally returned from upstairs, carrying what appeared to be a photo 
album. Running through the pages, she came up to one particular 
photograph. &quot;There,&quot; she finally said, showing the picture to Coleman. 
&quot;Is she the one?&quot;

The photograph was an old Polaroid, which showed a smiling 9 year-old 
Rally standing next to what appeared to be an equally-smiling older 
teenaged girl with pale blonde hair and wearing a white blouse and long 
pleated green skirt and wearing a silver crucifix. Coleman looked at the 
picture and said, &quot;Yeah it is... only a little older.&quot;

&quot;You actually met that girl?&quot; Becky said.

&quot;You never told me that, Rally,&quot; May added. &quot;How did you meet her?&quot;

Rally set down the album on the coffee table, leaned back in her chair 
and began with, &quot;It was about ten years ago, right after Mum was 
murdered. Dad wanted to take her back to England for her funeral, so I 
went with him. Mind you, I was still upset at the time.&quot;

&quot;How can I blame you?&quot; Becky said. The others nodded in agreement.

Rally smiled at her friends and continued, &quot;All of a sudden, Dad 
announced that he had some business in London that he had to take care 
of. I suspect that it was to make arrangements for the funeral... or to 
find out more about Mum&#39;s killer, so he dropped me off at an old friend 
of his. They were a wealthy family that lived on the outskirts of the 
city and were well-connected with the Royal Family... and their last 
name was Hellsing. I was a little intimidated by the whole thing and 
didn&#39;t know what to expect...&quot;

FLASHBACK...

The trip from Heathrow Airport to this mansion outside London was short, 
but for the little girl sitting in the back seat, it didn&#39;t matter. 
Rally was all cried-out when she arrived at the Hellsing mansion, 
staring numbly... but not without curiosity... at the well-manicured 
lawns of the estate, which was built inside the ruins of an old keep. 
But as before, it didn&#39;t matter. Her mother was gone and nothing could 
change that harsh fact.

Her father exited first, walking up to a gray-haired and bearded 
gentleman and immedietly struck-up a conversation. After a few minutes 
of talking, he walked up to Rally and said, &quot;Irene, I&#39;m going to going 
out for a few days, mostly to make arrangements for the funeral. I&#39;ve 
kindly asked Sir Arthur here,&quot; he nodded at the gentleman, &quot;to take you 
in while I&#39;m gone.&quot;

&quot;But Daddy,&quot; Rally piped up, &quot;why do you have to leave? I want to stay 
with you.&quot;

&quot;I know, Irene,&quot; her father answered, &quot;but there are some other things I 
need to take care of as well. And frankly... some of those places is 
where a little girl like you shouldn&#39;t go to. Now I won&#39;t be long, two 
days at the least, three of five at the most. In the meantime, I want 
you to enjoy yourself and pay attention to what Sir Arthur says.&quot;

Rally sighed discouragily but said, &quot;Yes, Daddy.&quot;

&quot;Very good, sweetheart.&quot; Rally&#39;s father then hugged her and planted a 
small kiss on her forehead as a black-haired elderly gentleman, 
obviously the family butler, removed Rally&#39;s luggage and had it taken 
inside the mansion with help from the staff. Once that was done, he got 
inside the black Rolls-Royce and departed. Rally simply stood and waved 
goodbye and the car drove from the estate.

A few minutes later, Rally was escorted by Sir Arthur Hellsing inside 
the mansion, where the little girl looked in awe at the inside. &quot;Wow,&quot; 
was all she could say as her eyes took in the sight of the old house; 
the walnut walls, the various paintings that decorated them, not to 
mention the size of the place. It was bigger than their home in Chicago.

&quot;You seem impressed, are you young lady?&quot; Sir Arthur finally said, 
smiling.

&quot;Y-yes sir,&quot; Rally answered bashfully, looking at the elderly gentleman.

&quot;No need to feel embarrassed,&quot; Sir Arthur chuckled. &quot;Now, I&#39;m a very 
busy man and I want you to know that if you need anything, feel free to 
ask Walter here about it,&quot; he pointed at the black-haired butler.

&quot;Arthur,&quot; another gentleman, entering the foyer of the mansion near the 
three, &quot;there&#39;s something I need to discuss with you.&quot;

&quot;In a minute, Richard.&quot; Sir Arthur then turned to Rally and explained, 
&quot;You&#39;ll have to excuse me. It seems my younger brother has something to 
tell me.&quot; He then turned to Walter and said, &quot;Could you show Miss 
Vincent to her room, Walter?&quot;

&quot;Indeed I shall, Sir Arthur,&quot; Walter answered, bowing. &quot;Come this way, 
Miss Vincent,&quot; he said to Rally as he picked up her suitcase. Bashfully, 
the young girl complied and followed the butler.

They had only gone a short distance before Rally noticed a set of stairs 
that appeared to go down. Intrigued, the black-haired girl paused to 
peer into the gloom that seemed to envelop the landing below. &quot;Excuse 
me, Miss Vincent,&quot; Walter called out.

Snapping out of her trance, Rally swung her head around and saw the 
butler glowering at her firmly. &quot;What?&quot; she squeaked out.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid that way is off-limits to young girls like you,&quot; Walter 
added.

&quot;W-what?&quot; Rally stammered, wondering if she did something wrong.

&quot;Walter?&quot; a new voice called out. Soon, a teenaged young woman in pale 
blonde hair swooped down and comforted Rally. &quot;Now do not go scolding 
her, Old Friend. She just got here and is unfamiliar with the place.&quot; 
Bending down, she looked at Rally and said, &quot;You will have to forgive 
Walter here. He didn&#39;t mean to go off on you like that. He was just 
worried about you. Beside, I am not allowed to go down there, either, so 
I would not let that trouble you.&quot;

Rally felt relieved. &quot;Oh,&quot; she said. &quot;Well... I wasn&#39;t really worried... 
uh... Miss... uh...&quot;

&quot;Oh how rude of me, I have not introduced myself. My name is Integra 
Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing. I am the daughter of Sir Arthur Hellsing.&quot;

&quot;Well thank you,&quot; Rally said. Looking to Walter, she nodded and added, 
&quot;Thank you for telling me that. I&#39;ll remember in the future.&quot;

&quot;Why thank you, Miss Vincent. I was glad we came to an understanding on 
this matter,&quot; Walter said. &quot;Miss Integra,&quot; he added, turning to the 
teenager, &quot;what about your studies with your father? You should be 
getting ready for that.&quot;

&quot;Oh that is alright, Walter. Me and Father had already taken care of 
that this morning,&quot; Integra answered. &quot;So, Miss Vincent,&quot; she asked the 
girl, &quot;shall I accompany you to your room?&quot;

&quot;Why sure!&quot; Rally said, smiling. &quot;But I was wonder Miss Hellsing... 
could you call me Rally?&quot;

&quot;Why certainly,&quot; Integra said, &quot;if you will call me Integra.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a deal!&quot; Rally said, gleefully accompanying the two upstairs.

INTERRUPTING FLASHBACK...

&quot;And that was how I first met Integra,&quot; Rally said, taking a break to 
relax.

&quot;Wow... that was interesting, Rally,&quot; May said, she, Becky and Coleman 
obviously impressed with the story. &quot;Kinda makes the life I led a little 
boring.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t go that far,&quot; Rally smirked.

Coleman scratched his bearded chin as he looked at his friend and said, 
&quot;So how long you stayed at the Hellsing estate, Rally?&quot;

&quot;For about three days,&quot; she answered, her blue eyes twinkling. &quot;During 
that time, me and Integra were almost inseparable... except when she had 
to study with her father, that is. We went on a picnic together... along 
with Walter, got to know the countryside... even walked on an old Roman 
road near the estate.&quot; Then the smile left Rally&#39;s face as she continued 
with, &quot;Then came Mum&#39;s funeral, which meant we had to go home.&quot;

RESUMING FLASHBACK...

&quot;I wish we didn&#39;t have to go so soon, Integra,&quot; Rally said sadly. The 
funeral had ended two hours ago, and now Walter was preparing her for 
the trip home. Integra, along with Rally&#39;s father, sat nearby as the 
young girl was being fussed over.

&quot;I know, Rally,&quot; Integra said. &quot;To tell you the truth... I could use the 
company right now.&quot; She paused a bit, looking a little sad. &quot;Father&#39;s 
been ill of late, and I am afraid that he will soon be leaving us.&quot;

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Rally gasped. &quot;You mean... he&#39;s going to die?&quot;

Integra nodded sadly, brushing a tear from her eye. &quot;Do not worry about 
me, Rally. I still have Uncle Richard to lean upon. God willing, I will 
get through this, just like you got through the loss of your mother.&quot;

&quot;Uh... Irene,&quot; Rally&#39;s father said, &quot;could you stay with Integra for a 
bit. I&#39;d like to talk to Walter for a bit.&quot; He nodded to Walter, who had 
finished with Rally and came aside him. &quot;So what do you think, Walter?&quot; 
he whispered.

&quot;To put it frankly, Mr. Vincent,&quot; Walter whispered back, &quot;I do not trust 
Richard at all with Integra&#39;s welfare. He was waiting for a long time 
for Sir Arthur to die and I dread to think what will happen if he finds 
out that Integra is to inherit the Hellsing leadership.&quot;

Rally&#39;s father nodded, adding, &quot;All the same, it&#39;s best you keep an eye 
on her for a while. Wouldn&#39;t want anything to happen to her.&quot; Walter 
nodded again as he returned to Rally, picking up a Polaroid camera. 
&quot;Tell you what, Irene,&quot; he said. &quot;How about I give you and Integra here 
a memento of your stay here?&quot;

Smiling, Rally agreed and soon the two girls posed together as her 
father snapped-off two pictures and handed the girls one each. As soon 
as the photos developed, both girls assessed their individual poses. 
Then saying their final goodbyes, Rally and her father left the Hellsing 
estate, with Rally waving goodbye to Integra, who was standing alongside 
Walter as the car drove off.

END FLASHBACK...

&quot;And so I left England and returned home,&quot; Rally concluded. &quot;Later, I 
found out from Dad that Sir Arthur died not long after we left... and a 
week later her uncle Richard died as well.&quot;

&quot;Boy, that&#39;s strange,&quot; Becky said. &quot;I would think someone like him would 
be around still.&quot; She then paused and added, &quot;By the way, if this 
Integra is in the United States, do you think you might look her up?&quot;

&quot;Doubtful,&quot; Rally sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t even know if she&#39;ll remember me, 
being it was a long time ago.&quot;

&quot;Well anyway,&quot; Coleman added, getting up, &quot;I for one would like to see 
her again and apologize for Kevin&#39;s behavior. I gotta get home. Talk to 
you later.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;ve got to get home, myself,&quot; Becky said, also getting up and 
following Coleman to the door. As she was making her way out the door, 
she piped up with, &quot;Now remember Rally, you owe me $300.&quot;

Fighting the urge to strangle Becky, Rally forced a smile and said, 
&quot;Uh... yeah I&#39;ll remember, Becky. Thanks a lot.&quot; As soon as the door 
closed, the smile faded as she growled under her breath, &quot;Fucking 
bloodsucker!&quot;

&quot;I agree,&quot; May added, walking up to her friend. &quot;Becky just has no 
patience.&quot;

&quot;I know, I know,&quot; Rally added, &quot;but lately it seems a lot of the crooks 
around here must&#39;ve gotten smarter and are appearing in court. There 
isn&#39;t as many bail jumpers these days.&quot; She then turns to May and 
reluctantly said, &quot;Do you think... you can ask Kenny if he can lend us a 
few hundred... at least until business picks up?&quot;

&quot;I wish I could,&quot; May glumly said, &quot;but I got a call from him today and 
he had to leave town all of a sudden. Something about... waiting until 
things cool off with that spill near Joliet. I guess he didn&#39;t want to 
get blamed for anything if something blows up.&quot;

&quot;Great,&quot; Rally groaned, her shoulders slumping.

JOLIET, NEAR SUNSET...

The car carrying Agent Lewis and Sir Integra finally made the stop at 
the reestablished command center, which was moved two kilometers further 
back as per Sir Islands&#39; request. Stepping inside, she walked up and 
greeted her old friend. &quot;It is nice seeing you again, Sir Islands,&quot; she 
began. &quot;I trust your holiday was not ruined too much.&quot;

&quot;Not as bad as I feared, Sir Hellsing,&quot; the gentleman answered, 
&quot;although this American general is a little perturbed about having an 
outsider run his show.&quot;

&quot;Well it looks like we are going to ruin his day even further,&quot; Sir 
Integra added, finally lighting up the cigar she had in her mouth. 
Finally deciding to address the general, she walked up and said, &quot;So... 
shall we get started, General?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; the general began, &quot;you could begin by telling me what the hell 
is going on in that farmhouse and why my men are not going in.&quot;

&quot;Very well, I&#39;ll get to the point,&quot; Sir Integra began. &quot;That farmhouse 
that your men tried to assault is the den of a vampire. The men of your 
Drug Enforcement Agency and Illinois State Patrol had been killed by 
this vampire and turned into ghouls, as well as the S.W.A.T. members 
later dispatched.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sir Islands told me that and I still find it hard to believe,&quot; the 
general said. &quot;What I don&#39;t know is how in the world are you going to 
solve that problem.&quot;

&quot;Have patience, General,&quot; the blonde woman said, exhaling a puff of 
smoke. &quot;As we speak, the solution is at this moment being deployed.&quot; She 
then reached for a cellphone, press a number on the speed dial, and as 
soon as the connection was made and answered, she said, &quot;Have you 
reached the deployment point, Walter?&quot; she then activated the speaker.

&quot;We have indeed, Sir Integra,&quot; Walter&#39;s voice came over the other end.

&quot;Very well. Proceed with the operation.&quot; She then hung up. &quot;Well, 
gentlemen,&quot; she added, &quot;all we have to do now is sit back and wait for 
results.&quot;

&quot;Well... no disrespect or anything...&quot; the general said, &quot;but what 
exactly are you going to use against this... vampire and those ghouls?&quot;

&quot;If you want to know,&quot; Sir Integra said, smiling, &quot;then I will tell 
you... but you might be surprised about the answer.&quot;

&quot;Oh shit,&quot; one of the soldiers hauling the crates at the deployment 
sight groaned, rubbing his sore arms, &quot;just what IS this weapon we&#39;re 
supposed to be deploying in the first place?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re telling me,&quot; his fellow said, also rubbing his arms. &quot;That last 
one was about as heavy as a load of bricks!&quot;

&quot;Provided you open these crates in the next few minutes,&quot; Walter 
grumbled, handing the two a pry bar each, &quot;you will be able to see for 
yourselves. Now I suggest you get busy, the sun&#39;s almost down.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; the first soldier said, working in the heaviest crate.

&quot;You know, Pete,&quot; the second soldier said as he worked the lid off, 
&quot;from what ol&#39; Alfred said,&quot; pointing his head at Walter, &quot;you would 
think we&#39;re setting free vampires.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, Al,&quot; Pete said, starting on his crate, &quot;or it could be a 
high-tech fly swatter for all it&#39;s...&quot;

&quot;HOLYSONOFAWHATTHEFUCK!!!&quot; Al screamed, rapidly stumbling away backwards 
from his crate. Sure enough, inside was what appeared to be a coffin 
constructed in oak, a wooden crucifix nailed to its lid. Working 
gingerly, Pete undid the second crate, which held another coffin. 
However, this coffin was black, trimmed in silver, and with strange 
writing on its lid.

&quot;What the hell is this?&quot; Pete whimpered as he saw the black coffin... 
then he screamed as the lid was opened on its own accord.

The figure that exited the coffin was tall... a male with a red 
trenchcoat, a charcoal-gray suit, shin-high riding boots and white 
gloves... and he stood up and looked at the trembling soldier, his red 
eyes appearing to drill holes into his soul. The figure looked around, 
surveying his surroundings, then picked up a broad-brimmed red hat and 
turned to Walter. &quot;So,&quot; he said in a rich baritone voice, &quot;this is the 
United States. Not much to it, eh Walter?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s only a small portion of the country, Alucard,&quot; the butler said, 
taking what appeared to be a blood packet from the refrigerated cooler 
he picked-up from the truck.

&quot;Oh... is that right, Angel of Death?&quot; the red-clad vampire said, taking 
the blood packet from Walter. He then pulled the top from the silicon 
hose and began drinking the blood as if it was a juice box. &quot;If at all 
possible, I would like to see the rest of the country. Wouldn&#39;t that be 
an adventure?&quot;

&quot;I am certain it would be that, Alucard,&quot; Walter answered dryly.

Recovering slightly from his shock, Pete leaned over to Walter and 
whispered, &quot;Excuse me... but is he what I believe he is?&quot;

&quot;Indeed he is,&quot; the butler replied. &quot;I must ask you and your friend here 
not to reveal what you&#39;ve seen tonight.&quot;

&quot;Are you kidding?&quot; Al said, joining the others. &quot;If we told them what 
they are, we&#39;re libel to be thrown in the looney bin.&quot;

Walter nodded, then turned to Alucard and said, &quot;I do believe we better 
wake up the other part of our team soon. I&#39;ll get your weapons ready.&quot;

Alucard grinned evilly as he disposed of the empty blood pack, then 
picked up another pack and walked over to the other coffin. &quot;Police 
Girl,&quot; he said, gently knocking on the lid, &quot;it&#39;s time to get up.&quot;

&quot;Alright, Master, alright. Just give me a moment, okay?&quot; a female voice 
from inside the coffin said. The lid then opened up, and to the two 
soldiers&#39; surprised, out came what appeared to be a beautiful young 
woman with blonde hair, blazing red eyes and wearing what appeared to be 
a bright yellow miniskirt uniform which showed off her 
more-than-generous figure. &quot;This is bloody inconvenient,&quot; she griped, 
stretching herself. &quot;There&#39;s got to be a better way to fly overseas than 
to be stuck in a box on the trip.&quot;

&quot;Even a vampire like myself must sleep in a coffin when flying over 
water, Police Girl,&quot; Alucard answered, smiling as he put on a pair of 
orange-yellow sunglasses. &quot;By the way, I hope that you&#39;re hungry.&quot;

&quot;More like famished, if appearances are correct, &quot; Walter said, peering 
inside the girl &#150; Seras Victoria&#39;s coffin. Inside was the spent remains 
of two blood packs, as well as the insulated bag they were kept in. As 
the butler bent down to clean up the leavings, he glanced at the lid and 
happened to see a picture of Sir Integra, sitting regally, taped to the 
inside. Not saying a word, Walter hastily closed the lid, then walked 
over to Alucard and said in a low voice, &quot;She did it again... still 
fawning over Sir Integra.&quot;

&quot;A girl can dream, can she?&quot; Alucard smiled back, then walked over and 
gave Seras the blood pack, for which she drained quickly. The red-clad 
vampire&#39;s smile grew bigger. A short time ago, he had to virtually 
threaten Seras to drink her blood. Now she was willingly drinking it, 
which more than increased her strength. &quot;So, Police Girl,&quot; he finally 
said to her, &quot;are you ready for a little mayhem tonight?&quot;

&quot;More than ready, Master,&quot; Seras answered, almost eagerly.

&quot;That&#39;s the spirit,&quot; Alucard agreed, then turned to the butler and said, 
&quot;Walter, can you give us a brief description of the situation we&#39;re 
going to be facing?&quot;

Walter then proceeded to bring Alucard and Seras up-to-speed on the 
situation at the farmhouse. Afterwards, he motioned to the two soldiers 
to bring forth two cases from the truck. The smaller of the cases was 
brought before Alucard. &quot;You already have your weapons, Alucard, so this 
case contains the necessary ammunition you need. Miss Victoria,&quot; he 
turned to Seras, &quot;we did bring your Harkonnen cannon along with us, but 
for this mission it was deemed that &#39;rate of fire&#39; was more important 
take-down ability.&quot; The larger case was opened to reveal the machine gun 
she used when she joined the Hellsing Organization.

&quot;It&#39;s perfect, Walter,&quot; Seras answered. &quot;Thank you.&quot; All of a sudden, 
she happened to see the two soldiers staring at her... only not in fear. 
&quot;What are you two doing?&quot; she asked in an annoyed voice.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Pete started, sounding like a kid with his hand caught in the 
cookie jar, &quot;nothing really.&quot;

&quot;Yeah-yeah,&quot; Al added, &quot;nothing at all!&quot;

&#39;Why do I have the feeling I&#39;ve run into a bloody bunch of perverts,&#39; 
Seras thought to herself, her left eyebrow twitching uncontrollably as 
she gave the two a doubtful look.

Alucard just chuckled and telepathically told his fledgling, &#39;Just 
showing their appreciation for beauty, Police Girl. Don&#39;t be too hard on 
them.&#39; Then just as quickly, he said aloud, &quot;Well, shall we be going?&quot; 
Seras nodded, more than eager to get away from the soldiers&#39; stares.

Walter then got on his cellphone and informed Sir Integra that the two 
has set out. &quot;Yes, Sir Integra. We&#39;ll do that soon.&quot; After hanging up, 
he turned to the soldiers and said in a voice a tone louder than he 
normally used, &quot;Gentlemen, I suggest we return the coffins into the 
vehicle and get ourselves to the British Embassy extension in Chicago. 
Now let us get to it.&quot;

Reluctantly, the two stopped staring at Seras in order to comply. 
However, Pete told Al quietly, &quot;I don&#39;t care if she IS a vampire... I&#39;d 
do that girl in an instant.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Al answered. &quot;She&#39;s a total babe.&quot;

Walter simply shook his head and adjusted his monocle, wondering if they 
would feel the same if they really knew what Seras was.

The area around the farmhouse looked as if Hell had ascended from the 
depths and placed itself upon the earth. Among the wrecked vehicles and 
discarded weapons, there appeared to be rotting pieces of the I.S.P.&#39;s 
S.W.A.T. team and the D.E.A. agents strewn around the grounds... and 
some of those pieces looked as if they were chewed upon. Seras looked 
around the horrifying sight, her face screwed in distaste. &quot;Disgusting,&quot; 
she whispered. &quot;You would think that ghouls would have better table 
manners than this... but it&#39;s all the same, Master, no matter how many 
times I see it.&quot;

Alucard didn&#39;t answer, instead continuing onward. Suddenly, he held out 
his gloved hand and stopped in his tracks. Seras quickly complied. In 
front of them, a group of ghouls... some of them wearing police 
uniforms... were shambling towards the two vampires, their eyes glowing 
as they stumbled onward. &quot;Situation C,&quot; Alucard atoned, &quot;releasing 
control art restriction to level 3.&quot; He then quickly drew from his coat 
his .454 Casull... &#39;Joshua&#39; and took aim.

Seras also acted quickly, slamming a clip into her machine gun and 
making sure her machete, which was strapped to her belt, was handy. The 
two then struck, Alucard blasting away one ghoul at-a-time. His 
fledgling also attacked, the Draculina cutting down another group of 
ghouls to pieces. During this battle, Seras leapt upwards and overhead 
the ghouls, firing in mid-air. She didn&#39;t bother aiming, yet she 
accurately cut-down the ghouls she shot.

Alucard grinned hugely as he saw Seras dispatch so many ghouls in that 
manner. &#39;Yes, Police Girl,&#39; he thought to himself, &#39;that&#39;s the way to do 
it... feel the darkness, but RULE the darkness, do not let the darkness 
rule you!&#39; Seeing a few more ghouls, the red-clad vampire then switched 
guns... his &#39;Jackal&#39; gun... and with a single shot destroyed those few 
remaining. Thus the way was clear as he strode inside the farmhouse.

The FREAK that had inhabited the farmhouse looked like your average 
meth-head... gaunt, pale, with long hair and teeth that were decaying, 
although the fangs he had were still intact. &quot;So you got past those pigs 
I turned, you motherfucker!&quot; he snarled. &quot;Well looks like you&#39;ve hit the 
motherfuckin&#39; jackpot... &#39;cause I&#39;m gonna rip your motherfuckin&#39; head 
and shit down your motherfuckin&#39; neck!&quot; However, the FREAK never got the 
chance... on account of Alucard opening fire with the &#39;Jackal&#39;. The 
red-clad vampire had to admit that this FREAK was a strong one... he 
emptied an entire clip into him and all he was able to accomplish was 
disable him. Grinning, Alucard prepared to drive his hand into the 
pseudo-vampire&#39;s heart.

&quot;MASTER!!!&quot; Seras&#39; voice called out. Distracted, Alucard turned to see 
his fledgling, who body was covered with blood and gore from her 
previous battles. Machete in hand, her red eyes glowing brightly and a 
psychotic look on her face, she snarled, &quot;Let me kill him! Those men he 
turned in ghouls were fellow officers of mine! Their deaths have to be 
avenged! I beg of you, let me have him! His head is mine!&quot;

Mildly surprised, Alucard noticed that the FREAK was slightly recovering 
from the shooting he gave him. But a bright grin came over his face as 
he said, &quot;By all means, Police Girl... the kill is yours.&quot;

The FREAK, surprised at being spared, just glared at Seras and smirked, 
&quot;A god-damned skirt... killing me? Well go ahead, you fuckin&#39; little 
whore... I dare you!&quot; He drew a switchblade and added, &quot;Who knows? Maybe 
after I cut you to pieces, I&#39;ll strip you down and fuck you where you 
stand!&quot;

&quot;SHUT UP!!!&quot; Seras shrieked as she charged at the FREAK. The fake 
vampire dodged the first slash, but could not avoid the remaining 
slashes... which were at a speed that was not possible for the FREAK to 
copy. In the span of two seconds, his arms and one of his legs were cut 
to pieces.

Injured, bleeding and obviously angry, the FREAK precariously stood on 
his one remaining leg. Seras then dropped the machete she used and 
slowly crept up to him, her psychotic grin enhanced with a wild look in 
her glowing eyes. &quot;You... fuckin&#39;... little... freak...&quot; the FREAK 
managed to sputter, rage in his eyes.

&quot;For the last time, you damned bloody murderer...&quot; Seras growled in a 
low voice, then drew back her right arm and thrust in into the FREAK&#39;s 
chest as she yelled, &quot;SHUT UP!!!&quot; A look of surprised came over the 
FREAK&#39;s face, seeing Seras&#39; arm sticking into his chest and exiting from 
his back. Then he exploded into a bloody cloud, pieces of his body 
dropping on the young vampire as she continued to grin. Then the grin 
fell from Seras&#39; face as she collapsed on her knees, panting in 
exhaustion. &quot;Bloody jackass,&quot; she managed to say.

Then Seras jumped as Alucard applauded behind her. &quot;Bravo,&quot; he said, a 
big smile on his face. &quot;Police Girl, you have done me proud! I&#39;ve never 
seen such malice from in all the time you&#39;ve embraced the dark! In my 
eyes, you are truly a powerful vampire!&quot;

&quot;Oh please, Master, you&#39;re embarrassing me,&quot; Seras bashfully said, 
getting up. Looking at her soiled uniform, she added, &quot;Oh bloody hell, 
I&#39;ve made another mess of myself. I just know Walter is going to be 
unhappy about cleaning another of my uniforms.&quot;

&quot;Oh I don&#39;t think Walter would mind cleaning up after you,&quot; Alucard 
said, placing his hand on her shoulder. &quot;And I think this little 
adventure will help you impress Sir Integra as well.&quot;

&quot;MASTER, DON&#39;T SAY THAT!!!&quot; Seras yelled, her pale face turning 
beet-red.

Alucard simply grinned. He already knew the truth about his little 
fledgling... she was in love with their master. If Seras had a 
heartbeat, the red-clad vampire knew that it would be beating a 
mile-a-minute whenever she saw Sir Integra, but was to bashful to 
proclaim her love for her. However, Alucard was in no mood to spoil 
whatever Seras felt for the master of the Hellsing Organization; he&#39;ll 
simply let things progress in their natural manner.

However, before saying anything, Alucard bent over where the FREAK 
originally stood... and picked up a small rectangular piece from the 
floor. Then something else caught his eye... what appeared to be an 
injection vial that was on a table. &quot;Come,&quot; he said to Seras, &quot;it&#39;s time 
we made our way to the base camp.&quot;

&quot;Er... right,&quot; Seras stammered, still feeling embarrassed by Alucard&#39;s 
insinuation.

It was a half-hour since the soldiers guarding the command center 
reported hearing gunshots coming from the farmhouse. Now the watch 
reported two figures &#150; one of them apparently armed &#150; was walking down 
the road. Quickly, several soldiers made their way to the road and drew 
down upon the two.

Sir Integra, Sir Islands, Agent Lewis and the National Guard general 
exited the command tent, hearing the news. Using a night-vision scope, 
Sir Integra was able to identify Alucard and Seras &#150; although they had 
no body heat, the infrared illuminator on the scope clearly showed them. 
Leaning to the general, she whispered her findings, which made him call 
out, &quot;Hold your fire!&quot;

The soldiers relaxed, allowing Alucard and Seras to pass. The two 
vampires then proceeded to the four. &quot;The limited power release has been 
completed,&quot; Alucard said to Sir Integra. &quot;The target FREAK has been 
eliminated... and the ghouls he produced have been mercifully silenced.&quot; 
Looking to Agent Lewis, he added, &quot;I&#39;m afraid that open casket funerals 
for the dead officers may not be possible, but I&#39;m certain you can 
identify the remains.&quot;

&quot;I expected as much, if what Sir Integra told me was true, Alucard,&quot; 
Lewis said. &quot;My thanks for resolving this situation.&quot;

&quot;And mine as well,&quot; Sir Integra added.

&quot;I&#39;ll have you to know,&quot; Alucard continued, &quot;that it was the Police Girl 
herself had eliminated the FREAK responsible for this mess.&quot; He grinned 
evilly as he said, &quot;She was wonderful, a most magnificent hunter I must 
add.&quot;

Surprised, Sir Integra turned to the young vampire and said, &quot;Captain 
Victoria... is this true?&quot;

Blushing, Seras managed to say, &quot;Uh... yes, Sir Integra... although I 
could use a shower and a change of uniform because of it.&quot;

&quot;Well rest assured,&quot; Sir Integra added, smiling, &quot;you will get both as 
soon as you and Alucard arrive at the Embassy extension in Chicago.&quot;

&quot;There is one more thing,&quot; Alucard added, holding out his hand. &quot;We had 
discovered these on the premises where that FREAK was hiding.&quot; It was 
the rectangular object and the vial.

&quot;Damn,&quot; the Hellsing master said under her breath, &quot;not another of those 
chips?&quot; Then her attention turned to the vial. &quot;Agent Lewis,&quot; she said, 
handing the vial to the Homeland Security agent, &quot;do you have any idea 
what this is?&quot;

&quot;Offhand... no,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ll have this analyzed at D.E.A. to find out 
what it is.&quot;

&quot;Please make sure I am informed of this, for I am afraid our stay in 
your country may have to be extended because of this matter.&quot; She also 
handed the chip to Lewis and added, &quot;I will provide your agency with we 
have got on this in exchange.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll let you know what I find... and thank you, Sir Hellsing,&quot; Lewis 
said before departing.

Finally turning to Sir Islands, Sir Integra said, &quot;Well, I will take 
over this matter. I leave you to the rest of your holiday, my friend.&quot;

&quot;My thanks, Sir Integra,&quot; Sir Islands replied, shaking her hand.

Departing the base camp, Sir Integra watched as Alucard and Seras were 
helped into a covered truck. Her car would escort the truck to the 
extension office of the British Embassy in Chicago, where hopefully 
Walter has gotten provisions ready for all of them. As she got into the 
back seat, she reached into her vest pocket... where she pulled out an 
old Polaroid picture of herself as a teenager and a young Rally Vincent. 
&#39;Who knows?&#39; she thought to herself, &#39;maybe tomorrow I will have a 
chance to visit an old friend.&#39;</pre>
