----------

Nervousness was wracking Michiru&#39;s nerves as she followed the two 
gleaming eyes dragging her further away from the campsite and deeper in 
the thick bush of the forest. Of course, she was confident in her 
fighting abilities. After all, she was an ogress, which roughly meant 
that everything could be on her menu, except maybe rocks... and 
cockroaches... and skunks of course...

Alright, there were a few exceptions, but she was positive that she 
could handle a mere puss! Yeah! I was going to be a walk in the breeze!

Well... Okay, she had to admit Haruka was a damningly good-looking, 
fluffy and deliciously charming puss, but just a puss non-the-less! One 
head, two arms, two legs - Michiru&#39;s eyes twitched - a... tail, eight... 
breasts, golden silk-like fur, incredibly cute ears that would flatten 
themselves on her head when she so adoringly pouted...

&#39;Who am I kidding?&#39; She chastised herself while grabbing her head in 
despair. &quot;I&#39;m doomed!&quot;

The air itself was thick with anticipation as she ambled on the slightly 
damp carpet of moss, so thick actually that Michiru was sincerely 
surprised it could still slide down her throat without choking her... 
Much... At last, she erupted in a fairly large glade, silvery moonlight 
bathing it in gentle greys and dark shadows. A river cut through its 
length, lapping its grassy banks, its stream inviting to a tempting dip 
in its depths. But, as she locked her gaze with Haruka&#39;s, now wasn&#39;t the 
time to indulge in such pleasures... Her foe was calmly waiting a few 
paces away from her, leaning on a large boulder by the river. Her 
striking figure was bathed in the same shades of grey and black as her 
surroundings while her glinting eyes attentively followed each and every 
curve... err, movement of the ogress.

&quot;So, my preciousssss... I see you finally decided to come and confront 
me?&quot;

Michiru raised an eyebrow &quot;Your... preciousssss? That&#39;s... cheesy... And 
what&#39;s with the &#39;sss&#39;?&quot; The look of rapt attention on Haruka&#39;s face 
was... unsettling to say the least...

Haruka just shrugged, the glint in her eyes intensifying with amusement. 
&quot;Well, you can&#39;t attract mice with kerosene...&quot;

&quot;Err, didn&#39;t the right proverb involve bees and vinegar?&quot;

&quot;What can I say? I&#39;m a cat after all, I prefer eating up mice than bees, 
although I could make an exception with such an alluring bee as 
yourself...&quot; Replied the cat coolly, her voice taking a feral tone.

Michiru melted away like cheese in a Swiss fondue.

&#39;Oh damn! She got me here!&#39; She straightened up, angry at finding 
herself so easily distracted. &quot;Flattery won&#39;t help you winning this 
fight...&quot; She lied, but then smirked. &quot;Come here and bring it on, or are 
you just talk?&quot; She shifted to a fighting stance.

Haruka detached herself from the boulder and unsheathed her razor-sharp 
sword in one fluid motion. &quot;Be careful with what you ask for, pretty 
lady...&quot; She mock saluted.

They slowly began to turn around each other, appraising their opponent 
with practiced eyes as they exchanged gauging jabs. Actually, Michiru 
noticed, Haruka&#39;s eyes seemed to appraise something altogether different 
from her fighting skills... She let her gaze drop to where the giant 
cat&#39;s gaze had fastened itself and suddenly felt a fierce blush spread 
from her heaving chest all the way to her cheeks.

Haruka took advantage of the opening, grabbed one of the young ogress&#39;s 
wrists, twisted it and attempted to take her down. Michiru, seeing the 
danger, wrenched her arm free and jumped out of the way. Not without 
spraining her wrist a little though. Michiru winced. Damn the cat was 
fast! She really was dangerous! Michiru looked up, expecting to find a 
smug look on her foe&#39;s face. She was startled to find a curious mix of 
worry and annoyance instead.

Why would Haruka feel that way? Did she really think she could beat her 
in just a single move? How arrogant! Anger rose within the ogress. Sure, 
she wasn&#39;t by far the toughest of her kind, but she could still hold her 
own in a fight. And she was going to prove it right now!

Michiru took a deep breath and gathered her power &quot;MUD SUBMERGE!&quot; Her 
attack wasn&#39;t very powerful. She was horrified to find that she just 
couldn&#39;t bring herself to hurt the giant cat, which was bad, considering 
she highly doubted her opponent would have such qualms.

&quot;You&#39;ll have to try harder and faster if you want to make me feel it!&quot; 
Haruka taunted while safely dancing away from the magical blast.

Michiru smirked. So, that was how it was going to be? &quot;You want me to 
come harder on you? I&#39;ll give you just what you want!&quot;

&quot;Oooohh ! Sounds promising!&quot;

She&#39;d just have to use the big sticks for... this... one......... 
Err.... The young ogress resisted the urge to smack her head on a nearby 
boulder. &#39;Why, oh why does my brain have to keep coming up with 
troubling images like that? It was so totally unfair!&#39; She lamented 
internally. She came out of her funk in time to barely dodge a leg sweep 
and get out of the way once again.

&quot;You seem very intend on having me on my back!&quot; She said, more to gain 
some time than anything else. Hard as she tried, she couldn&#39;t find any 
weakness in her opponent&#39;s guard, proving once again that Haruka&#39;s 
reputation as a skillful fighter wasn&#39;t usurped.

Haruka smirked. &quot;Well of course, that would certainly be one of the ways 
I would have you...&quot; She chuckled at the startled blush spreading once 
again on her lovely ogress&#39;s cheeks. &quot;What can I say? I&#39;m an assassin. 
I&#39;m certainly no gentleman, you know that. So if you leave yourself... 
wide open... I will take advantage...&quot;

Michiru was shocked. &quot;You would dare to force yourself on me?&quot;

&quot;Forcing myself on you? I wouldn&#39;t need to... This isn&#39;t forcing.&quot;

&quot;How arrogant of you! You think I&#39;m just going to surrender for your 
pretty eyes? If you do something to someone that they are in the 
impossibility to resist, then it&#39;s forcing them!&quot;

Haruka chuckled and began circling around the ogress like the predator 
that she was. &quot;I never forced anyone. Well, at least I never forced a 
woman to do something she didn&#39;t want...&quot; She amended. The circles were 
becoming smaller as the puss&#39;s voice grew low and tempting. &quot;Besides, I 
could ask you the same question. What about the spell you cast on me?&quot;

&quot;The spell... What spell?&quot; Momentarily distracted by the unexpected 
change of subject, Michiru was helpless to counter Haruka&#39;s sudden 
attack and soon found herself tackled on the ground, a tall form above 
her hindering each of her movement. Not that she really wanted to move. 
She found her treacherous body liking very much being where it was, 
trapped between the fresh grass of the river banks and the warm furry 
body of her enemy, the smell of this summer night enveloping the both of 
them.

&quot;This is a fight, yet, you were lost in your little fantasies the whole 
time. I&#39;m not blind. I&#39;ve seen the way you look at me. You don&#39;t want to 
fight me.&quot; The low voice turned into an amused purr that sent little 
shivers in Michiru&#39;s body. &quot;What you want of me is very different and 
way sweeter... This is why you cast this spell on me, isn&#39;t it? I don&#39;t 
know how you knew who I was back then, in the tavern, nor how you did 
it, but since then, all I can think about is you. The way you look, the 
way you sound, the way you smell... The way you feel... I have tried, 
the gods know I have, to put it aside, to complete my mission 
regardless, but I simply can&#39;t stand hurting you. I&#39;m so well ensnared 
that I don&#39;t even want to be freed of this spell. I&#39;m attracted to you 
like dirt to a toddler. I can, no, I want to give it to you. To give it 
all. I want to be yours and I want you to be all mine. You know you want 
to give in also. Come with me, I could make you happy beyond reason. 
Come on, what would be so wrong about that? Give me a chance?&quot; The last 
was said pleadingly and would have won the ogress over even if she 
hadn&#39;t added brokenly. &quot;Or free me and face the consequences honorably.&quot;

Michiru&#39;s voice caught in her throat, her heart was racing so fast it 
was a wonder it hadn&#39;t burst out yet. It was everything she&#39;d hoped 
someone would tell her one day. Well, except for the toddler part maybe. 
Although, if that meant she wanted children, she would be quite happy as 
well to have some. Not right away, of course, they had time after all, 
but she could easily imagine herself holding a small green furry bundle 
in her arms. Although, maybe they would adopt...

A small, tender smile slowly brightened her face as she gazed in those 
fascinating green orbs. &quot;You&#39;re right and so wrong at the same time.&quot; 
She watched the confusion playing so close to her with childish 
enjoyment. &quot;You&#39;re right when you say this is what I want, that you&#39;re 
what I want. However, where you&#39;re wrong... Well, even if I wanted to 
set you free I couldn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know of any love spell. If I did, I 
wouldn&#39;t be here, which would have been a real pity, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

Haruka&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;You mean to say... I&#39;m really in love with you? 
All the lovey-dovey mushy stuff I just sprouted wasn&#39;t induced by some 
sort of magically romantic stupor?&quot;

&quot;Err... Yes, I&#39;m afraid love was the only magic involved here... Nothing 
surnatural, although it does feel like it is... Maybe Cupid had a hand 
in this.&quot;

&quot;Oh gods! I&#39;m really doomed, aren&#39;t I?&quot; That was said with a shy smile, 
which left a feeling that doom wasn&#39;t such a bad thing after all.

&quot;Funny you would say that, it was exactly what I was thinking before 
coming here. But you know what? I don&#39;t care. I don&#39;t care about my 
family, I don&#39;t care about my kin anymore. As long as you are by my 
side.&quot; Michiru laughed at the light blush appearing on Haruka&#39;s cheeks, 
which she stroked gently. &quot;You&#39;ll get used to all this mushiness...&quot; She 
grinned. &quot;Eventually...&quot;

Haruka grinned back. &quot;Yeah, eventually...&quot; Relaxing completely, the 
sandy-furred cat took the time to lose herself in tender blue orbs, 
before ever so slowly leaning down, enjoying every second of it. Her 
gaze irresistibly drifted to inviting lips...

Neither of them noticed the small stampede careening their way until it 
was too late. Shock was what took them. Actually it was more something 
like SHOCK! Yes, complete and utter SHOCK when they found themselves 
unexpectedly dumped in the icily embrace of the river instead of warm 
arms. When cold water filled their mouth instead of hot tongues.

Michiru, being the good swimmer that she was, quickly and efficiently 
kicked her way up, only to find her new-found lover flailing her arms 
erratically. Obviously, the cat didn&#39;t know how to swim and was 
panicking. The young ogress swiftly swam behind her and grabbed her by 
the shoulders. That wasn&#39;t such a good idea since in her panic, Haruka 
struggled harder and brought them both under. When they broke the 
surface again, they were both panting heavily and spluttering. Michiru 
turned around and faced the terrorized feline. She cupped Haruka&#39;s face, 
forcing her to focus on her while tying to soothe her. &quot;Haruka! Shhh! 
Please calm down. I&#39;m here. Everything&#39;s okay&quot; She repeated over and 
over until the cat settled down.

Haruka&#39;s breath was still raged but at least she&#39;d considerably calmed 
down, even if Michiru could still see the terror in this green eyes. 
&quot;Mi-Michiru... I hate water! I hate it! I don&#39;t know how to swim. I&#39;m 
gonna drown here! Take me out of this, please!&quot; The feline whimpered.

The young ogress sighed. Apparently, she wasn&#39;t about to do watersports 
with her anytime soon. Too bad, she&#39;d always dreamed about diving in the 
fascinating aquatic depths with a trusted buddy. &quot;Now Haruka, you may 
not have noticed it, but you&#39;re tall enough to stand in the river...&quot;

Silence fell, save for the now far away stampede, and crickets, and a 
few unconcerned owls...

&quot;Err...&quot;

Haruka stood upright and indeed found that her feet touched bottom.

&quot;See, it isn&#39;t so bad...&quot; Michiru had wrapped her arms around Haruka&#39;s 
neck.

Haruka nodded. &quot;It isn&#39;t, but I&#39;d still rather be out of this if you 
don&#39;t mind...&quot; With that she headed for the river bank, grabbed 
Michiru&#39;s bottom and lifted her out of the water before following her on 
the dry land. Michiru let a mock outraged squeak at the action, but soon 
found her lips too occupied to express her feeling about Haruka&#39;s casual 
manhandling of her body.

&quot;Err... Haruka, why are you licking my face?&quot;

The cat interrupted her activity, and her steadily growing purr, 
puzzled. &quot;Well, you&#39;re all wet... I thought... I mean, I just swore I&#39;d 
protect you, I don&#39;t want you to catch a cold or something... hum...&quot; 
Haruka fiddled with some grass nervously &quot;Or maybe my tongue is too 
rough... I&#39;m sorry if I made you uncomfortable...&quot;

Michiru remained silent a long time, considering The giant cat gravely. 
She thought long and hard and finally came to the only reasonable 
conclusion: &#39;To hell with everything!&#39;

Michiru shifted until she straddled Haruka&#39;s long legs. &quot;No, Haruka, 
your tongue isn&#39;t too rough. As a matter of fact, I quite enjoy the 
feeling of it, and...&quot; She reached over, gently rubbing behind Haruka&#39;s 
ears whose purring instantly got louder &quot;... I would like it very much 
if you would help me getting... dried...&quot;

Haruka smirked her trademark cocky smirk &quot;My lady&#39;s wishes are my 
command...&quot;

&quot;However, this seems hardly fair. I should put my hands where my mouth 
is and... reciprocate the favor. After all, I can&#39;t have you do all the 
work... And you&#39;re so drenched, your hair are all flattened.&quot;

&quot;Well, you&#39;re quite wet yourself, though I do like the way your cloth 
stick to your lovely curves...&quot; Haruka replied mischievously. Suddenly 
she seemed to remember something. &quot;By the way, what was that? I seem to 
remember female screams then all of a sudden we were in the water...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t know either. But whatever it was, it probably have 
something to do with all these arrows...&quot; The glade was now indeed 
covered with sharp arrows. She shrugged, dismissing the subject. 
&quot;Anyway, I think we have better things to do right now instead of 
wondering about some crazy boar hunt party...&quot;
