<h1>Keep Thy Brother Safe (part 1 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Angelica Lilac was not a graceful princess; She was a murderer, a 
prostitute. A huge taste of incest, a taste of divorce, a criminal and a 
mother, She willingly confessed that in trail when she drowned her dead 
lover&#39;s sister Floryte publicly. 

Angelica Lilac clamped in her cell, hoping her criminal masterminds 
would get her out of this cell. She waited patiently with the evil smirk 
on her face knowing someone will come. She expected lots of visitors; 
most of the people whom she had sex with. She heard the riot outside her 
cells, louder than a football pitch. Angelica was all used to this, it 
was just as she thought it would be; it suited her lifestyle perfectly. 
Also her niece Tasha visited every month. 

She got the utter revenge on her school bully Delia, whom ran away with 
Angelica&#39;s nephew, killed her lover Shelito Paz who killed her son and 
planned to murder her brother. If her niece Tasha (who is now queen) 
hadn&#39;t of met that boy Gary (who was now Tasha&#39;s husband) Angelica would 
have never been able to plan her nephew&#39;s reunion of his long lost 
father king Rage (who died of tumour). Angelica was also involved with 
the monk assassination and the murders of Dr Spoona and Mr Paykei. 
Angelica had a quick fling with &#39;Jado the fighting king&#39; before she went 
to prison. However she had an affair with a young boy of 17 called Brock 
Slate. Brock was one of her nephew&#39;s dearest friends. 

Angelica had told her nephew when he visited her in prison, about her 
stepdaughter; Miyu:&nbsp;she was a vampire; Angelica&#39;s husband was a vampire. 
Miyu was Zelda&#39;s daughter. Zelda was Queen now. She was Angelica&#39;s 
sister in law. 

Angelica waited. Waited for her Valliant criminal bloody princes to 
rescue her out of this cell.&nbsp;

So she could terrorise again, meet the men and not be stuck with women 
for the rest of her life in a cold hard prison that she had been living 
in for the past four or five months 

Angelica suddenly heard screaming, clashing and banging, at first she 
thought it was the prison officers where doing their old raping habits 
until she opened the door, weird looking creatures attracted the 
prisoners and officers and led them to their deaths, a tall black boy 
walked with pride, a stubborn face hoping he had picked the right 
prison. It was Brock 

&quot;Angelica&quot; Brock roared he and Angelica the only people alive in the 
destroyed prison &quot; Angelica&quot; he cried again &quot; I came back for you&quot; 

Angelica stood out of her cell she grooved her way back into the young 
boy&#39;s arms she replied &quot;Takeshi&quot; Angelica smiled using Brock&#39;s Japanese 
name for the romantic effect &quot;you have proved yourself worthy by coming 
here today. How&#39;s my lovely family?&quot; 

&quot; Fine&quot; Brock replied, &quot;Ash and May are at school meanwhile Tasha rules 
the way your brother would approve of&quot; 

Angelica&#39;s face seemed concerned. Her niece, nephew and stepdaughter all 
seemed more important than her own remaining son Roy. 

For Roy She shed no tear, she shown no sorrow, she had no remorse, to 
keep up her morale.&nbsp;On the other hand she supported many criminal 
organisations, no one tried to help her out of here. Nobody. 

&quot;What is the matter?&quot; Brock asked calmly. Angelica squeezed Brock&#39;s left 
cheek; he felt no pain whatsoever, after 

&quot; I am just disappointed&quot; Angelica moaned &quot;at my other friends&quot; Angelica 
released Brock&#39;s left cheek, a red mark clearly shown. &quot;Why I thought 
they would save me, the villainous gang &#39;Jado the fighting king&#39;s gang&#39; 
the Dead Dance Villains. &quot; 

&quot; I returned&quot; Brock whispered to her ear &quot;because I love you&quot; 

Angelica felted his right arm finely connect to her neck. &quot;Takeshi,&quot; 
Angelica smeared &quot;stay with me, forever&quot; 

&quot;Your wish is my command&quot; Brock replied
