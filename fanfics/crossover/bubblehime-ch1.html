<h1>Bubblegum Hime (part 1 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Taken from the orientation guide to Fuka Academy: Fuka
is a advanced institution of learning, where students
can pursue their interests freely. Along with the best
in technological support we are situated in the Fuka
region, where peace and tranquility reign above all...

BOOM!

The explosion lit up the hills above Fuka academy as
the figure staggered, smoke pouring out from it&#39;s
steely shell. The Bio-mechanical creation Orphan
raised it&#39;s misshapen head, howling it&#39;s rage to the
sky as it forced itself forward once more.

&quot;Well that didn&#39;t work,&quot; Yukino Kikukawa said as the
silvery armored woman stood on a rise. The high tech
armor molded to her body like a second skin, covered
in diamond like scales that glittered in the
starlight.

Mai Tokhia soared over head, the wings or her red gold
armor shimmering like fire. &quot;Should I try another
fireball?&quot; she asked, the talon like gloves of her
armor flickering as the flame throwers charged up.

&quot;No,&quot; Yukino said, &quot;let&#39;s try another tactic.&quot; Her
armor seemed to shed several of the diamond like
scales, the silvery shapes swiftly zipping off as she
added, &quot;I&#39;ll use Diana&#39;s remote drones to survey the
damage.&quot;

The silvery diamonds swirled all around the hulking
creature in a graceful dance, cataloging the damage
even as the armored girls followed it. Soon Yukino had
a catalog of fractures and weak points, even as the
creature determedly tried to make it&#39;s way down the
hill to the peacefully waiting Academy itself.

&quot;Natsuki?&quot; Yukino called.

The sound of a wolf&#39;s howl echoed in the distance as
the icy silver colored figure leaped from the shadows,
a deadly looking cannon mounted on each arm. &quot;I&#39;m
here,&quot; she said to her coldly, &quot;what now?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve tried fire,&quot; Mai guessed, &quot;so now we do ice?&quot;

&quot;Precisely,&quot; Yukino agreed.

&quot;Duran,&quot; Natsuki gave a feral smile as she pointed one
arm cannon at the creature and ordered, &quot;load silver
cartridge! Fire!&quot; The weapon&#39;s arm mount hummed and
clicked as it loaded a bullet then fired, the
projectile racing through the air as it opened, icy
shards spreading out to sweep over the Orphan.

The crystal shards tore at the Orphan&#39;s armored flesh,
making it howl in pain as already stressed armor and
artificial flesh was put through yet another pounding.
Finally the outer shell broke, revealing the pulsing,
organic heart of the beast.

&quot;Now, Mikoto...&quot; Yukino started.

&quot;I believe,&quot; the smooth voice cut her off, &quot;I&#39;ll step
in.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Mai exclaimed, spinning about in midair on her
armor&#39;s jets.

The purple armored figure burst from the darkness,
racing right by them as she leapt gracefully for the
attack. The long, brown haired woman&#39;s suit looked
almost serpentine in design, with interlocking layers
of protective plates and wielding a fearsome looking
blade. She leapt up and over the struggling creatures
flailing claws and struck, plunging her blade home
into it&#39;s living heart and silencing it forever.

&quot;Hold it,&quot; Natsuki moved swiftly, blocking the woman
as she leveled her cannons on her and demanded, &quot;who
are you and where did you get that Hime armor?&quot;

The armored woman smiled at her charmingly as she put
up her naginata-like blade to her shoulder. &quot;I am
called Kiyohime,&quot; she answered Natsuki sweetly, &quot;and
know that I am always watching out for you.&quot;

Before anyone could respond to that stunning
announcement the mystery woman was gone, bounding off
into the night faster than they could react. &quot;Yukino,&quot;
Mai asked as she descended to their side, &quot;how could
there be another Hime?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Yukino said with a frown as she called
back her armor&#39;s remote drones, &quot;and where did Mikoto
go?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; the black armored figure stumbled
out of the darkness as Mikoto hauled her heavy sword,
&quot;I fell asleep.&quot;

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Yukino sighed. She flipped up her helm to
run at tired eyes, &quot;Everyone head home, de-armor and
set up the chargers. We&#39;ve had a busy night with three
Childe and we&#39;re probably low on juice.&quot;

&quot;Right, right,&quot; Natsuki frowned as she flipped her
wolf-like helm back into place then headed off on her
own.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Mai picked up Mikoto and took off, the two
trailing a shimmering tail of fire across the night
sky.

Tiredly Yukino headed off, traveling in a more
secretive manner back to her dorm. Leaping through the
woods she silently reached the dorms, then bounded up
to the balcony of the room she shared.

&quot;About time you got home,&quot; Haruka Suzushiro said
briskly as the blonde opened the sliding door to the
balcony and helped Yukino inside.

&quot;Sorry, Haruka,&quot; Yukino smiled as they entered, first
peeling off the helm of her suit, then getting the
back pack off with Haruka&#39;s help.

&quot;Any problems?&quot; Haruka asked as she tried to sound
casual, but there was concern in the taller girl&#39;s
eyes.

&quot;We were fine,&quot; Yukino reassured her as she began to
pull the segments of her armor off. A frown, &quot;There
was only one odd thing...&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Haruka unhooked the arm unit from the central
piece, peeling the armor down over Yukino&#39;s arm with
care.

&quot;There was a stranger dressed in Hime armor,&quot; Yukino
revealed as she stripped her leggings off, &quot;one I&#39;ve
never seen before.&quot;

Haruka grabbed a robe as Yukino slipped the cental
piece off, &quot;So, is Mashiro up to something again?&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t surprise me,&quot; Yukino said as she donned the
robe, &quot;I&#39;ll analyze the sensor data, see if I can
determine the pilot&#39;s identity.&quot;

&quot;But not tonight,&quot; Haruka said firmly, &quot;you&#39;re tired
and need your sleep.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Haruka,&quot; Yukino looked up at her with a
shy smile.

Haruka blushed slightly. &quot;Come on,&quot; she said as she
gently drew the girl towards their waiting bed.

The next morning the birds sand as an early morning
meeting of the Fuka Student Council came to order.
Shizuru Fujino yawned descretely, covering her mouth
carefully as she sweetly drawled, &quot;Pardon me.&quot;

&quot;The anti-Orphan squad is giving a report,&quot; Haruka
growled, &quot;you could at least act like you&#39;re paying
attention.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I am,&quot; Shizuru smiled sweetly as the brown haired
woman continued, &quot;I just had a later night than I&#39;m
used too.&quot;

&quot;Humph,&quot; Haruka sat back grumpily as Yukino continued
her report.

&quot;Three Orphan were successfully subdued,&quot; Yukino
revealed, &quot;and the armor Mashiro provided is working
quite effectively.&quot;

&quot;Though we could use more suits,&quot; Mai jumped in from
where she, Natsuki and a dozing Mikoto sat by Yukino.

&quot;There was one unusual event,&quot; Yukino ignored the
interruption with a sigh, &quot;there was a fifth Hime, a
woman calling herself Kyohime.&quot; She looked up to sweep
the leaders of the student council with her eyes, &quot;You
wouldn&#39;t know anything about it, would you?&quot;

Reito Kanzaki smiled charmingly as the black haired
man poured tea, &quot;You don&#39;t think we&#39;d keep things from
you?&quot;

&quot;Hell yes,&quot; Natsuki grumbled.

&quot;I&#39;m hurt,&quot; Shizuru batted her eyes innocently.

&quot;Zzzruk,&quot; Mikoto snored before Mai elbowed her gently.
&quot;What?&quot; the younger black hair girl blinked owlishly.

&quot;Try to stay awake,&quot; Mai whispered, &quot;and I&#39;ll feed you
lunch.&quot;

&quot;Yay,&quot; Mikoto beamed, &quot;lunch!&quot;

&quot;That concludes my report,&quot; Yukino said as she sat
down.

&quot;I&#39;ll approach Mashiro about more of the Hime armored
suits,&quot; Shizuru said, &quot;as well as ask about the
mystery woman in armor.&quot; She looked around the group,
&quot;Is that all? Then I declare the meeting closed.&quot;

&quot;About time,&quot; Natsuki said with a scowl.

&quot;Oh Natsuki?&quot; Shizuru purred as Natsuki was about to
flee.

Natsuki froze, the look in her eyes like a fawn facing
a wolf. &quot;Yes?&quot; she asked warily.

Shizuru smiled as she walked over to Natsuki&#39;s side,
&quot;I was wondering if you&#39;d like to join me for lunch?&quot;

&quot;Well, I...&quot; Natsuki started, &quot;Eeeek!&quot; Batting
Shizuru&#39;s hand away from her bottom she squeaked,
&quot;Shizuru, not in front of the others!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Natsuki,&quot; Shizuru smiled with false
innocence, &quot;I got carried away.&quot;

&quot;She gets more perverted every year,&quot; Haruka shook her
head as the rest of the student council got out of
there as fast as possible.

&quot;Poor Natsuki,&quot; Mai agreed as they closed the door to
the classroom behind them.

To be continued...?

Notes: Based off of several fan drawing of the Hime in
armor based off their Childe&#39;s designs, including
those of Serio555 on deviantart. Also a tip of the hat
to Dan Wisner as sounding board for various plot
points. :) Not sure if it&#39;ll be continued.
