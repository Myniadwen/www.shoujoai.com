<h1>Silly Assed Utena X-Over Fic (part 12 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/sillyass-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Ami looked up in honest surprise at the attractive young woman who was 
standing in her doorway, before finally recovering enough to actually 
invite her inside. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she blushed fiercely, escorting her to a 
chair.

&quot;No problem,&quot; Juri said with a casual wave, &quot;I should have called 
ahead.&quot; The orange haired beauty took the seat like it was her very 
own throne, claiming it for herself totally. She looked like royalty, 
too, dressed in the special uniform of the student council.

&quot;So what can I do for you?&quot; Ami asked.

The captain of the fencing team and newly elected leader of the 
student council looked vaguely uncomfortable. &quot;I&#39;m here about your 
add,&quot; Juri explained.

&quot;My add?&quot; Ami blinked. &#39;Did Usagi and the others put that personal ad 
in, the way they keep joking?&#39; she worried.

&quot;For the tutoring,&quot; Juri reminded her gently.

&quot;Right,&quot; Ami nodded with a little blush. She had put the ad up in the 
hopes of making a bit of spending money, but she hadn&#39;t gotten any 
responses so far. &quot;What did you need help with?&quot; Ami asked her 
curiously.

&quot;Literature and Maths, mostly,&quot; Juri sighed. &quot;With my student council 
work and the fencing, I&#39;ve fallen way behind,&quot; she admitted.

&quot;I should be able to help you with those,&quot; Ami nodded thoughtfully.

&quot;Do you have any references?&quot; Juri inquired.

&quot;You have seen my posted test scores, right?&quot; Ami asked pointedly. 
Even after her and the other Senshi&#39;s rather odd arrival here, her 
scores had stayed high.

&quot;Highest in the school, right alongside Miki&#39;s,&quot; Juri nodded. She 
looked over at Ami, &quot;The only thing you didn&#39;t ace was philosophy. Why 
was that?&quot;

&quot;The answer to one of the questions was debatable,&quot; Ami shrugged.

Juri chuckled softly at that. She produced a cheque with a flourish, 
&quot;This should cover our first five sessions. That way, we can see how 
it goes.&quot;

Ami shook her hand, sealing the agreement. &quot;I&#39;ll try not to let you 
down.&quot;

Juri shook the hand gently, looking down thoughtfully at Ami. &#39;This is 
a really bad idea,&#39; was what was running through her head at that 
moment.

Juri returned to her dorm, flopping down on her bed. &#39;I should have 
just asked Miki,&#39; she admitted. She closed her eyes, and the cute blue 
haired young woman appeared before her eyes.

Stumbling across the ad up on the billboard earlier that day had been 
quite the stroke of luck. Juri wasn&#39;t close to failing, yet, but she 
didn&#39;t want to take any chances. And Ami really was great 
academically, everyone agreed on that.

&#39;Problem is, that isn&#39;t the main reason I want to hire her,&#39; Juri 
admitted. Almost as soon as she had seen the young woman in glasses 
studying, she had wanted to get to know her. Finding out she was a 
friend of her friends Haruka and Michiru should have helped, but 
didn&#39;t really.

Her next idea had been putting notes in Ami&#39;s locker. A bit juvenile, 
but it was a classic move. She had written Ami three of them, and had 
been planning to reveal her identity with her fourth one, when Haruka 
had casually pointed something out to her. Ami threw out any love 
letters she received without reading them!

Thankfully, Ami had been hanging around the fencing club lately. At 
least that gave them something to talk about, whenever Juri got the 
chance. But the girl was so focused on her classes Juri rather 
suspected that Ami didn&#39;t even notice her.

&#39;I hope studying together at least helps me break her barriers down,&#39; 
Juri thought. She smirked, &#39;At least I&#39;ll get to look at her for 
awhile.&#39;

Juri dozed off, thinking of how cute Ami looked with her glasses on.

The next morning, in the dining hall, and breakfast was being served. 
&quot;You&#39;re tutoring Arisugawa?&quot; Haruka looked over the teacup at Ami 
thoughtfully.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ami nodded. The Senshi were having their breakfasts together, 
before splitting up to go to classes. It was one of the good points of 
being stuck here in Ohtori.

Rei and Minako exchanged a thoughtful glance, then Rei asked her, 
&quot;Have you considered Juri&#39;s reputation?&quot;

&quot;What reputation?&quot; Ami looked surprised.

&#39;Of course she wouldn&#39;t know,&#39; Mamoru thought, looking at the bookish 
girl fondly.

&quot;She&#39;s got a bit of a reputation as a playboy,&quot; Minako said gently.

&quot;Really?&quot; Ami squeaked.

&quot;I&#39;d take that with a grain of salt,&quot; Michiru said smoothly.

&quot;Why?&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;Most of those stories are being spread by Juri&#39;s ex-girlfriend,&quot; 
Haruka shrugged.

&quot;But she does have girlfriends,&quot; Minako nodded thoughtfully.

&quot;So do half the people here,&quot; Usagi chuckled, throwing a sidelong 
glance at Rei.

They talked for a while longer, then split up to go to their classes. 
&#39;Juri had a girlfriend,&#39; Ami mused, considering the famous duelist. 
She had thought her unapproachable, coolly remote even as she was so 
terribly beautiful.

Ami didn&#39;t want to think about it, but it haunted her throughout the 
day. The sun began to set, and the chime to her dorm room rang right 
on time. &quot;Hello, Juri,&quot; Ami smiled up at her.

A slight smile teased at Juri&#39;s lips, making Ami wonder about what she 
might be thinking. &quot;Good evening, Ami,&quot; Juri smiled at her warmly.

&quot;Let&#39;s look at your books,&quot; Ami gestured them to the table. The two 
settled down to work, and Ami let herself be lost in her work.

Juri was mildly astonished at how Ami casually organized Juri&#39;s work. 
Problems that had looked almost insurmountable were broken into easily 
manageable pieces.

&#39;Now if only she would notice me,&#39; Juri despaired. They had ran 
through the first five sessions, and academically Juri had improved 
dramatically. Selfishly, Juri booked another five, hoping that her 
personal life might improve, too.

Ami bent over the table, looking at her papers intensely. &quot;You&#39;re cute 
when you concentrate,&quot; Juri found herself saying.

Ami&#39;s head jerked up, her eyes wide, and Juri almost panicked. Then 
Ami smiled slightly, asking, &quot;Was that a pass?&quot;

Juri played along, &quot;I don&#39;t know, was that a catch?&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Ami smiled. She took a breath, &quot;I was wondering, would you 
like to come over for dinner one night?&quot;

In her head, Juri was jumping up and down and cheering, but outwardly 
she tried to stay calm. &quot;Sure, I&#39;d love to,&quot; Juri smiled.
