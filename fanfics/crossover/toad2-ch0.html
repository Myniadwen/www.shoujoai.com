<h2>Interlude:  The Dance of Shadows</h2>
<p>Zhu Shu watched Shan Pu walk down the hall towards the  stairs and sighed.  That had been far  harder than she had thought it would be.   Shan Pu’s eyes had barely left her the entire time she had helped her  dress, and the unspoken desire had nearly been more than she could stand.  Her heart had screamed at her to accept the  invitations from Ranma and Shan Pu to join them as another wife, but she knew  too well the disaster that awaited if she had.   She was happy her friend was on her way to her engagement, she just  wished…<p>
  She turned and looked at the formal Mandarin gown laid  out on her bed. She really should put it on and go down to join the ceremony,  but she just couldn’t summon the will to.   Her mind whirled with too many conflicting emotions: happiness,  jealousy, relief, despair… ever since she had merged chi with Akane, she had  felt like she was dancing along a razorblade.   The chaotic whirlwind of Akane’s passions had nearly shattered the iron  control she had been forced to build following Ying-Ying’s death, the sole  defense she had against the overwhelming grief…<p>
  She sat on the edge of the bed and picked up the small  framed picture Kasumi had given her of their kiss on the subway.  Her first day with the Tendos had been so  chaotic… and yet…  Kasumi had made her  feel so welcome, despite the way she had surprised her the night before.  The eldest Tendo sister had forged a friendship  with her that Zhu Shu cherished.  As  desirable as she found Kasumi, there was no feeling of tension between  them.  Kasumi knew Zhu Shu’s preferences,  knew Zhu Shu thought she was sexy, and simply accepted it, so it had become a  non-issue.  Kasumi had been there when  she’d needed advice on how to deal with Akane, and had even actively helped.<p>
  But this? This was something Zhu Shu couldn’t bring  herself to lay at Kasumi’s feet.  How  could she burden her with such chaos? No, it would not do to expose such a  fountain of light to the darkness that had consumed her soul with Ying-Ying’s  death, or the delicate balance she had achieved to survive.  <p>
  Until Akane…<p>
  She shut the thought out as she stood and went to her  closet, choosing a few simple dresses.   She had to go away… she needed time to think, to figure out which of the  emotions rampaging in her head were really hers… to try and find some way to  regain the emotional control the chi merger had nearly shattered.<p>
  After she had packed the dresses, she reached behind  her back and drew her swords.  She  removed the ribbons, then picked up her pack and the small sword stand Rei had  given her, heading down to the dojo, and the Tendo family shrine.<p>
  The peace that washed over her as she stood beneath it  helped her calm her raging thoughts. She needed that calm… she needed a counter  to the chaos her life had become.<p>
  As she set the swords down and draped her signet ring  over them, she realized where she should go… where she could find enough peace  to think.<p>
  She prayed to the Dragon to watch over the Tendos  while she was away, and she felt the comforting sense of his presence… It gave  her the strength to push her mental storm back and gain at least a little  equilibrium. <p>
  Control. How had she lost control? She had only intended  to prepare Ranma for Shan Pu, and to guide him to happiness with Akane. How had  she allowed herself to become so entangled?   In the momentary peace of the shrine, she had to admit that the chi  merger had only intensified what had already been happening.  She had been slowly losing her emotional  armor before it had turned her soul into a battlefield. <p>
  She found herself looking at the small duck nameplate  Akane had on her door. She’d been so engrossed in her musings, she had wandered  back upstairs - more evidence of her loss of control - but she had her answer.<p>
  Akane… the unexpected fiancée… the wild card.<p>
  Akane, the girl who had found the chinks in the armor  she’d built around her heart… the girl who had stolen away that heart… the girl  who had nearly driven her to abandon her duty, her honor, to throw away the  very things that had allowed her to go on living once Ying-Ying had died. <p>
  And yet… it was never to be. She was Ranma’s fiancée,  and soon to be Shan Pu’s.  She could  never be hers, not in any honorable way.    Not in any way that would not lead to a despair she would never wish to  see on Akane’s face.  No… it was better  to spare her that fate.<p>
  Back downstairs. She stood in the shadows to see Ranma  accepting Shan Pu’s betrothal, noting the jealous look on Akane’s face.  She sighed, hoping Akane would not cause Shan  Pu too many problems for a few days.  She  just needed to regain her equilibrium before the wall fell and allowed the  black flood of her grief to once more drown her in it’s cold embrace. <p>
  Outside. she walked down the street, not really going  in any particular direction, just wandering, led by the swirls of her thoughts  and the maelstrom of the emotions she’d inadvertently drawn from Akane.<p>
  Why had they merged chi?  Other than the ceremonial joining with Shan  Pu as her blood-sister, and the bonds she had with her swords, only Ying-Ying  had merged with her.  It had been so  wondrous, so joyous a bonding between them, eagerly tying their lives together  in their love and joy at sharing that love.   Yet for all the ecstasy of shared sensations, they had not shared each  others memories and emotions.  What had  made Akane so different?<p>
  She passed Ryouga, determinedly heading for the dojo.  She figured he might find it next week, as he was heading in exactly the wrong  direction. She smiled. She could sympathize with the lost boy - she had felt  like she was lost all the time recently too, wandering aimlessly through a  blizzard in the dark.  <p>
  Why had Ranma had to go and ask her to marry him?  Why hadn’t he just left their friendship  alone?  She had never meant for him to  learn of her love. <p>
  Her heart ached, and the loneliness threatened to  overwhelm her.<p>
  Alone. She’d been alone for too many years… ever since  Ying-Ying… until she came to Japan, where everyone cared for her.<p>
  The aloneness had been easier to bear when no-one  cared, when no-one knew about her heartache and failure but her aunt and  grandfather. The caring all her friends showed her had thrown the loneliness  into sharp relief, and brought back the whispers of her grief.  That it had not already poured from the  cracks in her wall of control and drawn her back screaming into the abyss was a  wonder she couldn’t explain.  <p>
  Footsteps… behind her. She stopped and turned. <p>
  A shadowy figure walked up the street towards her, her  features lost in the twilight. The dying rays of the sun twinkled off the  headpiece of her long golden staff, the ruby seeming to draw the light in and  burn. Long silver hair swirled about her ankles along with the long white robe trimmed  in red and black. Zhu Shu blinked.  As  she drew closer, that sense of familiarity grew stronger.<p>
  “Who are you?” she asked.<p>
  “A messenger, My Little Mouse with the eyes of a  Dragon.”<p>
  Recognition came. She had seen her nearly four years  ago… after…<p>
  The memory swept across her, of the day she had  succumbed to the blackness, had lost herself in the torrent and been dragged  under.  The wind had played through her  hair as she stood on the cliff where they had so often come to get away from  the village, where they had… The grief had been so overwhelming and it would  never end… could never end.  All she had  wanted to do was see Ying-Ying again. She had stepped forward…<p>
  …And awoken in her bed to the kind face before her,  all memory of how she had gotten there missing, lost in a golden fog.  Only the echo of Ying-Ying’s voice in her  ears.<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;I am here. Always and forever, I  am here.&gt;&gt;</em><p>
  That echo had allowed her to wall away the despair, to  face the world once more and somehow make it through.  There was nothing the world could throw at  her worse than the loss of Ying-Ying.<p>
  But she had not done it on her own.  When she had awoken, she had the Dragon  tattoo on her back.<p>
  “I remember you.” Zhu Shu said slowly. “You came the  day…”<p>
  “The Dragon claimed you.” the old woman finished. “Yes.  That was the first of our meetings. There have been others, in dreams.”<p>
  “Why are you here?”<p>
  “As I said, I am being a messenger.”<p>
  “And what is the message?” Zhu Shu looked at her  curiously. Was that a faint trace of green in her hair?<p>
  “The Wheel of Souls has spun out once more that which  once was. Look to the past to find the answers of the future. Be strong Dragon’s  Child, for the future you choose may affect more than just yourself. The game  has just begun. You may face many dangers and many foes, yet behind them all is  the same enemy. Choose your destiny with care, Little Mouse.” She turned to go.<p>
  “Wait!” Zhu Shu called. “Who are you?”<p>
  The old woman turned. “We will meet again soon  enough.   I must come to you twice more  in the flesh ere my onus to you is done and you meet me, for <em>my</em> first time anyway. I have not always  looked as I do now.” A sad sigh came from her lips. “I fear I must apologize  for my actions when I first meet you. I… regret them very much. I hope you will  remember that, after…” She turned and continued down the street.<p>
  Zhu Shu wanted to run after her, to ask her what her  puzzling words meant, but she couldn’t move her feet. Then, she was gone, lost  in the shadows…<p>
  A wave of dizziness washed over her as she sat up, suddenly  aware she was laying on a bus stop bench. She couldn’t remember how she had  gotten there. A golden haze once more lay over her memories of the last several  hours. She had been walking in the early afternoon and now?  A glance at a bank clock down the street  showed it to be after midnight.<p>
  She shook her head. Such a strange dream. <p>
  She stood and looked around, realizing the street  looked vaguely familiar, then turned around and realized why. Behind her, steps  rose up to a hilltop covered in cherry trees around a shrine. She was where she  had been heading: Hikawa Shrine.<p>
  Dismissing the disquieting vision, she climbed the  steps to the first place in Japan  she’d actually felt comfortable at and quietly opened the shrine doors. The  main shrine was quiet, the still glowing embers of the fire dimly illuminating  the room. Zhu Shu nodded to herself.    Stepping within was an almost palpable relief as she felt the peace of  the shrine envelope her and lessen the roar of her inner storm.<p>
  Stepping into the shrine’s center, she mentally laid  out a dragon mandala on the floor, fixing its boundaries in her mind’s eye and  ensuring there were no obstructions within it’s confines. Satisfied, she  finally closed her eyes and saw only the mandala as she drew out her ribbons  and began to dance.</p>
