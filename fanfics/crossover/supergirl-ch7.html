<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 7 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/supergirl-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre> Helena Wayne and Oracle appeared together, the dark haired young woman 
looking around her in awe. A view port nearby showed the airless surface 
of the moon, the stars twinkling off in the distance. &quot;Incredible,&quot; she 
murmured softly.

&quot;Welcome to the Watchtower,&quot; Oracle smiled up at Helena from her 
holographic wheelchair. &quot;Shall we go look for your new teammates?&quot; she 
asked.

&quot;I think I should be dressed appropriately first,&quot; Helena grinned.

Helena pulled the black bundle of cloth from her backpack and stripped 
herself efficiently down to only her bra and panties. The tight black 
pants went on first, then the black top with a purple bird emblem right 
over her breasts. The purple belt, gloves and boots were pulled on 
swiftly, then the black mask and cape settled on her shoulders.

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Kestrel smiled at Oracle after she had packed her regular 
clothes into the backpack she had carried and stowed it away in a nearby 
locker.

Oracle looked up at her thoughtfully as they moved through the 
corridors, &quot;May I ask why you chose the name Kestrel?&quot;

&quot;Just wanted to be another Bird of Prey,&quot; Kestrel smiled down at her, &quot;I 
thought I should choose a name in tribute to my two moms.&quot;

Oracle nodded thoughtfully, &quot;That&#39;s what I thought.&quot; The hologram 
flickered a moment as her attention shifted away for a moment, &quot;It looks 
like they&#39;re having fun blowing stuff up in the training room again.&quot;

The two kept talking as they walked together, soon coming up to a blonde 
young woman looking through a view port rather worriedly. D-ko looked up 
upon hearing their aproach and her eyes widened before she cried out, 
&quot;Intruder!&quot; She pointed her bare arms at Kestrel and suddenly a series 
of weapons popped out of her arms, laser beams targeting Kestrel.

The black clad woman coiled her slim body, getting ready to move at a 
moment&#39;s notice, but before she could take any action Oracle quickly 
came into D-ko&#39;s line of sight to shout, &quot;Don&#39;t shoot, she&#39;s a friend!&quot;

&quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; and D-ko popped the weapons away.

Oracle sighed softly, &quot;Kestrel, meet D-ko.&quot;

You could see the eyebrow being raised even under the mask as Kestrel 
echoed, &quot;D-ko?&quot; She tentatively offered her gloved hand and the blonde 
girl smiled and shook it vigerously.

&quot;Nice to meet you, Kestrel,&quot; D-ko said sweetly.

There was the muffled sound of an explosion, and Kestrel whirled around, 
looking about her cautiously, &quot;What was that?&quot;

Oracle calmly gestured her over to the view port, &quot;Take a look.&quot; D-ko 
and Kestrel joined her there, looking inside at the two combatants.

The tall redhead just wore a T-shirt and shorts, silver bracers gleaming 
on each arm. She burst with vitality, her eyes sparking with energy and 
a impish grin on her face. A near hit had left her clothes smoking, but 
she looked like she was having a great time.

The blue haired girl chased after her, her silvery bathing suit 
glittering. Her wristband cannons shot streams of bullet fire and energy 
bolts at her opponent, both of them maneuvering around the large chamber 
as they looked for any advantage. An exultant grin lit up fer face, a 
bit of blood trickling from the corner of her mouth.

Kestrel looked over at D-ko and Oracle, &quot;Are they trying to kill each 
other?&quot;

&quot;Nah, they do this all the time,&quot; D-ko shrugged.

&quot;And nobody&#39;s died yet,&quot; Oracle smiled wryly. She projected her voice 
into the chamber, &quot;A-ko, B-ko, we&#39;ve got company.&quot;

&quot;A-ko? B-ko? That explains D-ko, I guess,&quot; Kestrel sighed.

Not long afterward all five of them had gathered in the primary meeting 
room to talk. They sat around the round table, the JLA shield 
prominently displayed at the center. There had been some hesitation with 
the symbol marked seats, but A-ko soon picked the chair marked with 
Superman&#39;s shield, B-ko took Steel&#39;s, and Kestrel sat down on Batman&#39;s. 
Just above the table, the holographic Oracle mask floated, waiting for 
questions or comments.

&quot;Nice to meet you, Kestrel,&quot; A-ko said. She had changed to her Supergirl 
costume, her experession much more serious than before.

&quot;We were planning to contact you,&quot; B-ko smiled, her helmet sitting by 
her chair, &quot;but I guess Oracle was a step ahead of us.&quot; A small band aid 
rested on the corner of her mouth, placed there with loving care by 
D-ko.

&quot;She usually is,&quot; Kestrel laughed. She reached up to pull her hood back, 
her vshort dark hair falling gently into her eyes as she said, &quot;My real 
name&#39;s Helena Wayne. I&#39;m looking forward to getting to know you.&quot;

&quot;You already know ours,&quot; A-ko grinned, then she grasped her necklace and 
concentrated. Her hair darkened and straightened, &quot;But I&#39;m also known as 
Laurel Kent.&quot;

Oracle spoke up suddenly, &quot;We&#39;ve recieved a message from Maggie Sawyer.&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot; B-ko sat up straight even as her helmet clicked into 
place.

A image of Maggie Sawyer appeared, &quot;A being has appeared in the middle 
of Metropolis demanding that Superman face him and restore his honor.&quot;

&quot;Name?&quot; A-ko asked.

&quot;Sounded like Kalibak,&quot; Maggie answered.

Her mask back on Kestrel said, &quot;We&#39;ll be there as soon as we can.&quot;

&quot;Oracle, give us a briefing,&quot; B-ko said as she led the charge to the 
teleporters,

&quot;A son of the New God Darkseid,&quot; Oracle reported, &quot;physically very 
powerful, but not very inteligent. Fought Superman several times, both 
alone and with the help of his father&#39;s forces.&quot;

They climbed into the teleport tubes even as A-ko said to Oracle, &quot;Get 
us as near to the action as you possibly can.&quot;

The Watchtower disapeared, and a rooftop materialized around them.

&quot;Steel, give Kestrel a lift,&quot; A-ko said, fully in her Supergirl mode, 
&quot;I&#39;ll get there on my own.&quot; With that, she began bounding from roof to 
roof, right towards the fire and noise in the distance.

Steel snagged Kestrel&#39;s arm and they were off, flying right behind 
Supergirl. They passed over a taller building and saw the brutish 
figure, muscles bulging under his armor breastplate. Hair sprouted all 
over him, and his face was misshapen and ugly. Behind him, a sort of 
hole in space gaped open, and insect-like green armored figures emerged.

Oracle&#39;s voice camew over B-ko&#39;s radio, &quot;That&#39;s Kalibak, all right. 
Those things behind him are parademons, troopers from Darkseid&#39;s 
forces.&quot; A pause, &quot;D-ko is coming down.&quot;

&quot;Supergirl, Kalibak&#39;s yours,&quot; Kestrel said grimly, &quot;Steel and I will 
keep the parademons off your back.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Steel agreed, and they charged forward.

&quot;Where is Superman?!&quot; Kalibak roared.

Supergirl dodged his first clumsy blow, rocking his head back with a 
roundhouse blow, &quot;Sorry, he&#39;s busy at the moment. Will I do?&quot;

An enraged bellow was the only answer Kalibak gave.</pre>
