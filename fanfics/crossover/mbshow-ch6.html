<h1>The Mireille Bouquet Show (part 6 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/mbshow-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;And now,&quot; a familiar monotone voice said to loud applause, &quot;It&#39;s time 
once again for the Mireille Bouquet Show. Tonight&#39;s a very special 
political roundtable discussion on the war in Iraq, and the 
international strain between the US, France, and Central America. And 
now, here&#39;s the host of our show; Mireille Bouquet.&quot;

The audience grew louder as the beautiful blonde Corsican walked out on 
stage. She bowed happily to the crowd. &quot;Thank you so much,&quot; she said 
with a grin, &quot;And now, let&#39;s hear it for my co-host. She&#39;s the peanut 
butter to my jelly, Kirika Yumura!&quot;

The audience once again erupted into loud applause as the quiet young 
woman came out on stage. She opened her mouth to say something, but 
before she could the purple-haired &quot;mail-girl&quot; in the Groucho glasses 
and green cloak came out with a large bouquet of long-stemmed roses and 
handed them to the surprised Japanese woman.

&quot;For you,&quot; the mail-girl explained, adding &quot;From your truest fan.&quot;

As Kirika blushed sweetly at the unexpected gift, Mireille narrowed her 
eyes with a frown, &quot;Any flowers delivered to the mail-room for me?&quot; she 
asked, trying to keep any hint of jealousy out of her voice.

&quot;Just one,&quot; the purple-haired woman explained as she passed it over.

&quot;Well, I suppose I should be grateful,&quot; she said resentfully, &quot;After 
all, quality is more important than quantity and... Hey! This isn&#39;t a 
flower; it&#39;s a dandelion. They&#39;re weeds.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; the mail-girl said with a smile, &quot;That&#39;s all you get.&quot;

&quot;Humph, figures. By the way, have you had any luck yet tracing whoever&#39;s 
been sending me those prank letters yet?&quot;

&quot;Nope,&quot; she answered, adding &quot;It&#39;s a complete mystery.&quot;

&quot;Figures. Kirika, let&#39;s head over to the set and... Kirika?&quot;

The young Japanese woman wasn&#39;t listening; she was holding the bouquet 
in her arms as if it were an infant, a sweet smile gracing her face as 
she inhaled its fragrance.

&quot;KIRIKA!&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; the brunette asked as she finally looked away from the flowers 
and over at the sour host.

&quot;It&#39;s time to start the show! Now get rid of the flowers and get over 
there in your seat by my desk!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; the mail-girl said tenderly to the young co-host, &quot;I&#39;ll 
put your flowers in your dressing room for later.&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika nodded to her with a smile, adding &quot;Thanks.&quot;

The mail-girl then turned to Mireille, &quot;Would you like me to put your 
dandelion in your dressing room?&quot;

&quot;Oh shut up,&quot; the blonde muttered as she turned away and stormed over to 
her desk. She was shortly thereafter joined by Kirika, who sat in the 
seat next to her.

&quot;Mireille, is everything okay?&quot; the young co-host asked.

&quot;Oh, just peachy. I&#39;m the star of the show, but I get nothing but stupid 
prank letters and dandelions while you get roses and letters telling you 
how great you are, I...&quot; her voice died off as she saw Kirika looking 
down at the floor, &quot;(sigh) I&#39;m sorry. I suppose I should be happy that 
everyone else finds you as special as I do,&quot; she said as she reached out 
and stroked the younger woman&#39;s hair.

Kirika smiled cutely as she leaned into the hand. &quot;Mmm...&quot; she purred 
softly, &quot;Then you&#39;re not mad about the flowers?&quot;

Mireille smiled back at her co-host, &quot;Of course not, I...&quot;

&quot;Or all the fanmail I get talking about how cute and adorable I am?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot;

&quot;Or that box of chocolates a fan sent me last week? Or those French teen 
magazines I&#39;m always featured in? Or...&quot;

&quot;Kirika,&quot; Mireille said through gritted teeth as she narrowed her eyes, 
&quot;Let&#39;s wait until we&#39;re off the air to talk about all your fans, shall 
we?&quot; she then turned back to the camera and put on her best fake smile, 
&quot;And now, a word from our newest sponsor.&quot;

-Commercial Break-

As the beginning strings of Vivaldi&#39;s The Four Seasons starts to play in 
the background, the inside of a women&#39;s clothing store comes into view. 
As the camera shows various dresses on hangers and glimpses of the 
lingerie section, a woman&#39;s voice comes in.

&quot;Style, sophistication, elegance. Whether it&#39;s a night out on the town 
or that first date with someone special, you&#39;ll find what you&#39;re looking 
for here, at The Silky Doll.&quot;

The camera now pans to an elegantly-dressed woman with long silvery hair 
standing before a display of evening gowns, &quot;Hello, I&#39;m Sylia Stingray, 
owner and proprietor here at this lovely clothing establishment located 
in the heart of Mega Tokyo. We have an extensive line of lingerie and 
clothing for the woman on the go, guaranteed to impress and delight both 
the senses and the pocketbook.&quot;

&quot;And look here,&quot; Sylia said as she walked over to the left a bit where a 
nervous-looking young blonde was standing, &quot;Here we have a customer. 
Tell us your name and what brings you to The Silky Doll.&quot;

&quot;H... Hello.&quot; The young woman stuttered out, &quot;Yes, I am a customer, and 
definitely not a friend or employee of Sylia&#39;s who was forced into being 
here today. My name is Nene Romanova, and I shop here for the panties, 
as well as the...&quot; the blonde&#39;s voice drifted off. Sylia raised an 
eyebrow and gave her a look.

&quot;Psst,&quot; she whispered out the side of her mouth, &quot;Come on; finish the 
line.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; Nene answered back a bit too loudly, &quot;Linna&#39;s holding the 
next cue card upside down, I...&quot; she was cut off as a red-faced Sylia 
covered her mouth with her hand.

&quot;Where is she?&quot; an angry woman shrieked from off-camera. Nene&#39;s eyes 
suddenly went wide with fear.

&quot;Oh poop!&quot; the blonde cried out as she suddenly ran off, an angry biker 
chick running through the store after her.

&quot;I&#39;ll kill you!&quot; the biker growled, &quot;You gave that idiot Leon one of the 
photos of me in that damned pink dress from the bet, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Aaa! Sylia, Linna, help me!&quot; the blonde screamed. As the sounds of 
yelling and objects crashing to the ground continued in the background, 
Sylia looked back at the camera and sweat dropped as she attempted to 
salvage the situation.

&quot;Um... He, he... Yes, everyone comes here, from cute blonde computer 
geeks to homicidal butch rock stars. So remember to visit The Silky Doll 
on your next visit to Mega Tokyo. I&#39;ll look forward to seeing you then,&quot; 
she added as The Four Seasons once again started playing.

-End Commercial Break-

Mireille and Kirika looked at the monitor, then at one another, then 
back at the monitor again.

&quot;What in the hell was that?&quot; Mireille asked in disbelief, &quot;That was 
quite possibly the most unprofessional piece of garbage I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve obviously never seen reruns of this show,&quot; the mail-girl said as 
she walked back out onto the set.

&quot;What?&quot; Mireille asked.

&quot;Oh, nothing,&quot; she answered, smirking behind her Groucho glasses, 
&quot;Here&#39;s the latest batch of letters for this week&#39;s viewer mail.&quot;

&quot;Humph, thanks,&quot; Mireille murmured as she took the letters from the 
mail-girl. &quot;And it looks like the first letter is for you Kirika.&quot;

&quot;Mmm. &#39;Dear Kirika, everyone knows you shared a kiss with that smart, 
cute, talented and beautiful assassin Chloe. You&#39;re now with that much 
older bleached-blonde though...&#39;&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot;

&quot;&#39;...So what I and all the other fans out there would like to know is; 
when did you two first kiss?&#39; Well, I can still remember it like it was 
yesterday,&quot; Kirika said with a dreamy look in her eyes, &quot;We&#39;d returned 
from the mansion two weeks before, and...

-Flashback-

Kirika wiped the small bit of sweat from her brow as she hurried around 
the small apartment. Mireille would only be out shopping for a little 
while longer, and she needed everything to be perfect for when the 
blonde came back.

She&#39;d used the Corsican&#39;s computer while she was alone to look up how to 
set up a romantic dinner. It took all the younger assassin&#39;s nerve to 
even try this, but after all she and Mireille had been through, her 
feelings for her had evolved. She wanted to show her what she now meant 
to her, and she wanted to get it right. With checklist in hand, she ran 
around trying to make everything perfect.

Step 1- Romantic lighting is your friend: tapered candles in a darkened 
mood always set the right tone for the rest of your romantic evening.

Kirika looked all over the apartment, and eventually ended up using a 
large quilt she found in Mireille&#39;s bedroom closet. She draped it across 
the window, darkening the room. Next she looked around for tapered 
candles. All she was able to find was one citronella candle for keeping 
away mosquitoes, a birthday candle in the shape of the number two, and a 
lilac-scented candle in a jar. Shrugging her shoulders, she placed them 
around the room and lit them. In spite of the rather overpowering scent 
they gave off, they did give the room a warm look.

&quot;There now,&quot; she said, smiling happily as she looked back at the 
checklist she got off the internet.

Step 2- A red or purple table cloth will help set the mood; both colors 
are associated with passion.

Kirika thought long and hard about that one. Then she remembered the 
time the two of them were hired to kill a matador. She ran to a small 
chest by Mireille&#39;s side of the bed and, opening it, pulled out the bull 
fighter&#39;s red cape he&#39;d used in the ring. She then ran back into the 
living room and draped it over the grand piano, placing the citronella 
candle on top. She then looked at her handiwork and smiled.

&quot;Mmm,&quot; she muttered to herself self-satisfactorily.

Step 3- Use fine china plates to show that special someone how much she 
means to you.

Kirika looked, but could only find one set of dishes in the apartment. 
Deciding they would have to do, she placed them on top of the 
bullfighter&#39;s cape, and checked to make sure the dinner she was fixing 
was coming along well. She wasn&#39;t entirely sure what type of food would 
be considered romantic, but seeing as how the only thing she seemed to 
remember about cooking was how to make stew and rice, she hoped that 
would be romantic enough.

As the meal was finally ready, she heard the sounds of a key unlocking 
the door to the apartment, and smiled.

Mireille entered her apartment and immediately made a face as the 
pungent smells of lilacs and citronella assaulted her nose. The room was 
darkly lit by three candles, and as she looked around trying to figure 
out what was going on and why a dead matador&#39;s cape was draped over the 
grand piano, Kirika walked in from the kitchen wearing a yellow 
sundress.

&quot;Mireille,&quot; she began nervously, &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;Ow!&quot; the blonde yelled as she stubbed her toe in the dark room, &quot;Damn 
it,&quot; she growled as she turned on the light switch next to her, &quot;What in 
the hell&#39;s going on in here?&quot;

Kirika&#39;s face fell, &quot;I... I was trying to...&quot;

&quot;Yuck, it stinks in here,&quot; Mireille continued to complain as she pulled 
the quilt down from the window. She then opened the window, blew out the 
candles, and began to fan the smoke out with a piece of paper she found 
lying nearby, &quot;Good grief, what on earth were you doing in here? I 
swear, I leave you alone in the apartment for two hours and...&quot; it was 
then that something on the paper she was using caught her eye. She 
brought it up and quickly looked at it.

&quot;&#39;How to create a romantic evening,&#39;&quot; she read. She then looked once 
again around at the apartment. &quot;Oh...&quot; she murmured as she finally 
understood what Kirika had tried to do. She turned back to her roommate 
and saw the younger Japanese woman looking away from her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the brunette said in a low voice as a tear traveled down 
one cheek, &quot;It was stupid of me. I just thought that, after the mansion 
and everything...&quot;

Mireille came over to Kirika and took her in her arms. &quot;Kirika,&quot; she 
said softly, &quot;You didn&#39;t have to do all this.&quot;

The younger woman looked up at her with a surprised expression, &quot;I... I 
didn&#39;t?&quot;

Mireille smiled as she wiped Kirika&#39;s tear away with her index finger, 
&quot;Of course not. Back when I was approached by my uncle, I killed him 
instead of you. And when you went to the mansion I came for you, even 
after I found out you killed my parents. And when we were at the 
mansion, you killed Chloe instead of me. I even saved you from that pit 
instead of letting you fall to your death. Now if all that isn&#39;t love I 
don&#39;t know what is.&quot;

Kirika smiled happily back at Mireille as she tentatively leaned 
forward. The blonde leaned forward as well, closing the gap as their 
lips came together. After several minutes they broke the kiss, both 
women looking lovingly at one another as the scent of citronella and 
lilac continued to whiff out the open living room window. Finally, 
Kirika&#39;s face took on a puzzled look as something occurred to her.

&quot;Mireille,&quot; she asked, &quot;If we&#39;ve felt this way about one another all 
this time, why are we only telling each other now?&quot;

&quot;Meh, blame it on the writers,&quot; the blonde answered with a shrug, &quot;They 
thought it would be better to create a sense of ambiguity about us. You 
know, sort of let the audience fill in the blanks,&quot; she added before 
bringing her lips back to Kirika&#39;s...

-End Flashback-

&quot;And that&#39;s the first time we kissed,&quot; Kirika said fondly.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Mireille nodded with a smile as she reached over to take Kirika&#39;s 
hand in hers, &quot;I remember that, I...&quot;

&quot;It was also the first time we made love.&quot;

&quot;Um... Yes,&quot; Mireille said a bit uncomfortably, &quot;Well that&#39;s a bit more 
information than we...&quot;

&quot;And the second, and the third,&quot; Kirika continued, &quot;Oh, and it was also 
the first time you set up that trapeze in the bedroom and pulled out 
that Lil&#39; Bo Peep costume for me to wear, and the first time you wore 
that leather corset, and...&quot;

&quot;YES, THANK YOU KIRIKA, THAT&#39;S ENOUGH!&quot; the blonde yelled, &quot;Right, 
before we get kicked off the air due to mature content, maybe I should 
read my fan letter... And before anyone out there says anything, I&#39;ve 
taken the precaution of having the mail-girl screen my letters, so no 
more prank ones are going to get through,&quot; she said smugly, &quot;Now then, 
&#39;Dear Mireille, does your face hurt?&#39; What? No, why? &#39;Because it&#39;s 
killing me!&#39; Aaaaargh! And it&#39;s signed &#39;Anita Hoare,&#39; eh? Damn it, these 
were supposed to be screened!&quot;

&quot;Um, Mireille,&quot; Kirika muttered.

&quot;What in the hell kind of goofballs do we have working in the mailroom 
anyways? I...&quot;

&quot;Mireille, the show,&quot; Kirika reminded.

&quot;(sigh) Right, the show. Today ladies and gentleman we have a very 
special show for all of you. A political roundtable that will look at 
the war in Iraq from a global standpoint,&quot; Mireille explained as both 
she and her co-host stood up and moved over to the side of the stage, 
where a large table stood with three people already sitting around it.

&quot;Now then, over to my right are two retired military officers who 
actually served in the elite corps known as &#39;G.I. Joe&#39;, Lady Jaye and 
Scarlet.&quot;

The two women, wearing civilian clothing, nodded out to the audience who 
clapped respectfully. Mireille smiled at them, and then turned back to 
the camera, &quot;And over to my left, sitting next to Kirika, is a gentleman 
originally from Cuba who I&#39;m told recently moved to Miami, Florida, 
where he&#39;s gone into some sort of business, Mr. Tony Montana,&quot; the 
camera panned over to show Kirika giving an odd look to a man in a white 
business suit with a briefcase opened before him. &quot;Um, Mr. Montana,&quot; 
Mireille said, &quot;Could you please close your briefcase so we can all see 
you?&quot;

Tony closed the case as he quickly wiped off a conspicuous white 
substance from underneath his nose, &quot;Oh, sorry magn,&quot; he said, &quot;I didn&#39;t 
realize we were on the (bleep)ing air, magn.&quot;

Mireille winced a bit as she looked back at the camera, &quot;Um... I wish to 
apologize in advance for Mr. Montana&#39;s language. Apparently the part of 
Cuba he came from didn&#39;t teach him very proper etiquette...&quot;

&quot;Hey, what the (bleep) you (bleep)ing mean by that, huh?&quot; Tony asked as 
he sat back in his chair.

&quot;Not to worry though; we promise to try and edit out any foul language 
during this discussion. Now then,&quot; Mireille said with a smile, &quot;The 
topic on hand is the war in Iraq and how it&#39;s strained international 
relations, particularly between the US and France. Before we go any 
further though, exactly why did you two retire from G.I. Joe?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Lady Jaye began, her short brunette hair framing her attractive 
face as she spoke, &quot;After the whole fiasco with finding Cobra-La and 
discovering Cobra Commander was actually a giant snake, I decided that 
was enough craziness for me. Besides, my relationship with one of my 
fellow officers, Flint, was somewhat on the rocks, and before I&#39;d 
entered the military I was thinking of being an actress anyways.&quot;

&quot;That,&quot; Scarlet added, her long red hair pulled back in a ponytail, &quot;And 
those morons out at the Pentagon actually decided to promote Big Lobe to 
C.O. status.&quot;

&quot;I see...&quot; Mireille said thoughtfully, &quot;Getting back on topic, as a 
French woman I&#39;m intrigued by some of the resentment in the US against 
the French at the moment. Such as boycotting French wines, calling 
French fries &#39;freedom fries&#39;...&quot;

&quot;And don&#39;t forget the anti-French jokes,&quot; Scarlet put in.

&quot;Anti-French jokes?&quot; Mireille asked as she cocked her head to the side.

&quot;Sure,&quot; the redhead answered, &quot;You know, like, &#39;How many Frenchmen does 
it take to defend Paris? No one knows; it&#39;s never been attempted 
before.&#39;&quot;

Mireille gave the former Joe a dirty look, &quot;I see,&quot; she hissed, &quot;You 
know, we also have anti-American jokes. Like &#39;What do you call someone 
who can speak two languages? Bilingual. What do you call someone who 
speaks only one language? American.&#39;&quot;

Now it was Scarlet&#39;s turn to look angry, &quot;Oh really... &#39;Why does the US 
need the French on their side in the war in Iraq? So the French can show 
the Iraqis how to surrender.&#39;&quot;

&quot;&#39;Did you hear about the two US soldiers who...&#39;&quot;

&quot;Ladies, ladies, please,&quot; Lady Jaye interrupted, &quot;This isn&#39;t the way to 
carry on. I think if you&#39;ll both take a step back and look at things 
more civilly you&#39;ll see that insults aren&#39;t going to help resolve 
anything. Don&#39;t you agree Kirika?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Oh, mmm.&quot;

&quot;Mmm?&quot; Scarlet asked, &quot;Does that mean yes or no?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m assuming it means yes,&quot; Lady Jaye answered as she looked at Kirika 
once again, &quot;Right?&quot;

&quot;Mmm.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Montana,&quot; Mireille began as she turned to her left, &quot;You&#39;ve been 
strangely quiet over there. As a Cuban American, what&#39;s your take on the 
war in Iraq, President Bush&#39;s foreign policy decisions, and the 
political...&quot;

&quot;Okay, magn,&quot; Tony interrupted, &quot;I tell you one time magn, one time! I 
love the (bleep)ing US of (bleep)ing A, magn. But those (bleep)ing 
filthy cockroaches, those (bleep) (bleep) politicians magn, and those 
bankers magn, they (bleep)ing...&quot;

&quot;Holy cow!&quot; Scarlet exclaimed, &quot;Do you have turret&#39;s syndrome or 
something?&quot;

&quot;(bleep) you, you want a (bleep)ing piece of me, you...&quot;

&quot;(sniff) (sniff) Mireille?&quot; Kirika asked, &quot;Do you smell smoke.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I do,&quot; the blonde answered, &quot;I think it&#39;s coming from the machine 
that&#39;s used to bleep out Tony Montana&#39;s foul language. It was never 
designed to edit out this level of cursing.&quot;

&quot;Kirika?&quot; Lady Jaye asked, &quot;You&#39;ve been mostly silent during all this. 
What&#39;s your impression of George W. Bush?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Kirika said regretfully, &quot;But I don&#39;t do impressions.&quot;

&quot;Time and time again your President Bush has said that you&#39;ve &#39;turned 
the corner&#39; in Iraq,&quot; Mireille said, trying desperately to keep the show 
on topic, &quot;And it seems like time and again he&#39;s lied.&quot;

&quot;Now that&#39;s not fair,&quot; Scarlet countered, &quot;Yes our president has had 
setbacks, but...&quot;

&quot;(SNORT)&quot;

The four women at the table turned to Tony, who once again had his 
briefcase opened. &quot;Mr. Montana!&quot; Mireille growled out angrily, &quot;If 
you&#39;re doing what I THINK you&#39;re doing...&quot;

Tony closed the briefcase, his upper lip and the tip of his nose once 
again coated in the same mysterious white powdery substance as before, 
&quot;Hey, listen here you (bleep)ing Corsican cockroach!&quot; he yelled as he 
stumbled to his feet, &quot;You don&#39;t know who I is, do you?&quot; he asked as he 
pointed at himself, &quot;I&#39;m the (bleep) ing American dream, magn, I...&quot;

&quot;Why do you keep calling the host &#39;magn&#39;?&quot; Lady Jaye asked, &quot;She&#39;s a 
lady; show a bit of respect.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Scarlet added, &quot;And while you&#39;re at it, you might want to think 
about bathing once in a while.&quot;

Kirika looked from the two former members of G.I. Joe to Mireille, who 
had an agitated look on her face, &quot;Mireille, what is it? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;My bat,&quot; the blonde answered anxiously as she looked around, &quot;I can&#39;t 
find my baseball bat!&quot;

&quot;You want to (bleep)ing insult me, you (bleep)ing filthy cockroaches? Do 
you?&quot; he yelled as he pulled out a large semi-automatic from his jacket, 
&quot;Say hello to my little friend!&quot;

&quot;Holy (bleep)!&quot; Scarlet exclaimed as she grabbed Lady Jaye&#39;s arm and 
yanked her under the desk. Mireille likewise grabbed Kirika and dove for 
cover under the round table.

&quot;Just great,&quot; Mireille griped as Tony jumped on top of the table, &quot;I&#39;m 
stuck under a desk while a coke-crazed maniac has taken over my show.&quot;

&quot;What do you know,&quot; Scarlet quipped, &quot;At the first sight of a gun, the 
French once again cower.&quot;

&quot;Why you...&quot;

&quot;Ladies,&quot; Lady Jaye said as the sound of gunfire was heard above them, 
&quot;We&#39;re all cowering in fear at the moment, so knock it off!&quot;

Scarlet sighed, &quot;You&#39;re right Jaye,&quot; she said reluctantly. She then 
turned to Mireille and held out a hand, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. Friends?&quot;

Mireille smiled as she took the offered hand, &quot;Friends,&quot; she answered.

&quot;You see,&quot; Lady Jaye said, &quot;The Americans and the French CAN get along 
when it really counts.&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika added.

Scarlet looked from the young Japanese woman to Mireille, &quot;Okay, 
seriously, I don&#39;t get it. What in the hell does &#39;Mmm&#39; mean?&quot;

&quot;Hey you (bleep) (bleep)ing (bleep) cockroaches (bleep)ers, magn! Come 
out here, you (bleep)s want a piece of me? Do you? I&#39;ll (bleep) 
(bleep)...&quot;

&quot;We have more pressing problems,&quot; Lady Jaye said, &quot;Like how we&#39;re going 
to get out of this alive.&quot;

&quot;Damn it, where&#39;s my baseball bat?&quot; Mireille growled as the camera 
panned from the group of four women huddled under the table to the 
backstage area where the mail-girl in the Groucho glasses was holding 
the bat behind her back as she whistled innocently. The camera then 
panned back over to the set.

&quot;How you (bleep)ing like me now you (bleep)ing cockroaches?&quot; Tony 
screamed as he shot more rounds into the air.

&quot;Okay, look,&quot; Mireille said, &quot;We are not just a bunch of helpless women 
here. We are two former elite US military officers and two former 
assassins...&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika put in.

&quot;Like she said, &#39;Mmm,&#39;&quot; Scarlet affirmed, adding, &quot;We need a plan.&quot;

&quot;Kirika,&quot; Mireille said hopefully, &quot;You have an uncanny gift of being 
able to make a weapon out of practically anything...&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika answered, &quot;I&#39;ve been meaning to talk to you about that. 
Some teacher in the US learned about that gift of mine and said he was 
interested in learning more about me and my talent.&quot;

&quot;A teacher in the US?&quot; Lady Jaye asked.

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika nodded, &quot;His name&#39;s Professor Xavier, and...&quot;

&quot;Later hon,&quot; Mireille interrupted, &quot;Is there anything you can think of 
right now to get us the hell out of this?&quot;

Kirika looked around from under the table, and spotted one of the stage 
lights near the table, &quot;Mmm,&quot; she said as she suddenly ran out from 
underneath the table to try to reach the light. Before she could though, 
a bullet hit the floor directly in front of her, stopping her in her 
tracks. She turned around and looked into Tony&#39;s crazed eyes.

&quot;That&#39;s (bleep)ing it!&quot; he yelled, &quot;I&#39;m going to (bleep)ing blow your 
(bleep)ing brains all over this studio,&quot; he said as he aimed his gun at 
her, &quot;I&#39;m...&quot; his voice died off as all the lights in the studio 
suddenly went off.

-BANG!-

&quot;AAAAA!&quot;

The lights then came back on. Kirika was unharmed, but Tony Montana was 
now lying face down on the table with fifty razor-sharp knives in his 
back. Slowly, a blonde head peeped out from under the table.

&quot;I think she got him,&quot; Mireille said as she and the others stood up. 
They walked over to Kirika, who was currently being looked after by the 
mail-girl.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; the mysterious young woman in the green cloak said as she 
pushed her Groucho glasses back up the bridge of her nose, &quot;Tony won&#39;t 
hurt you...&quot;

&quot;Kirika!&quot; Mireille exclaimed as she wrapped her arms around the younger 
woman, &quot;You did it, you...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Kirika answered as she shook her head, &quot;I didn&#39;t kill Tony. I 
don&#39;t know who did.&quot;

&quot;Really, but... Hey!&quot; the blonde said as she noticed the mail-girl, 
&quot;You&#39;re not supposed to be on set during taping. And you failed to 
screen an insulting letter I received earlier.&quot;

&quot;Are all your shows like this?&quot; Lady Jaye asked Kirika.

&quot;Mmm.&quot; The brunette answered.

&quot;Again with the &#39;Mmm&#39;,&quot; Scarlet groaned as she clutched the sides of her 
head, &quot;You&#39;re making my head hurt.&quot;

&quot;Well, so much for a political round table discussion,&quot; Mireille said as 
she rolled her eyes, &quot;Oh well. Tune in next time when our guests will be 
Vampire Hunter D, Speed Racer, and that evil sorcerer and enemy of 
Smurfs everywhere, Gargamel. Till then, bye.&quot;

End Notes- Linna, Sylia, Nene, Priss and the Silky Doll all come from 
Bubblegum Crisis 2040, Scarlet and Lady Jaye are from G.I. Joe (I went 
with the cartoon version because I&#39;m more familiar with it than the 
comic book one), Tony Montana is from the film Scarface, and of course 
the Professor Xavier that Kirika makes reference to is Professor X of 
the X Men.</pre>
