<h1>Megatokyo Burning (part 7 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a>

<a href="../crossover/megaburn-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>        &quot;Welcome home,&quot; May smiled warmly, the beautiful young brown 
haired woman reaching out to take her lover&#39;s coat.

        Keiko smiled back, her gray streaked brown braid bouncing 
against her back. She was an older woman, nearly eighty, but modern 
technology and care had kept her youthful energy. &quot;Thanks, love,&quot; she 
sighed softly.

        &quot;How was your day?&quot; May asked as the two of them walked inside.

        &quot;Lousy,&quot; Keiko flashed a tired smile. She sat down in her 
favorite chair in the living-room, sitting back with a groan.

        &quot;What happened?&quot; May asked as she helped pull her lover&#39;s shoes 
off.

        &quot;Bioware&#39;s main competitor Re-genex was attacked last night,&quot; 
Keiko said, running her hand through her hair, &quot;and I think my bosses 
may be responsible.&quot;

        May stopped in surprise, &quot;You&#39;re serious?&quot;

        &quot;Very,&quot; Keiko sighed. She met May&#39;s eyes and smiled down at her 
wryly, &quot;I&#39;m just not sure what, exactly, to do about it.&quot;

        May set the shoes aside then sat down beside Keiko, snuggling 
close to her. &quot;Is this a theory or can you prove it?&quot; she asked gently.

        &quot;My research team was handed a data packet today,&quot; Keiko said 
softly, &quot;the coding on the files indicates it was from Re-genex.&quot;

        &quot;Oh dear,&quot; May sighed.

        &quot;I could try to go to the police with the information,&quot; Keiko 
mused, &quot;but Bioware has a lot of pull in the city, they might be able to 
get out from under it.&quot; She puffed out a sigh, &quot;Leaving me swinging in 
the wind.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll do whatever I can to protect you,&quot; May promised as she 
took her hand, gently cradling Keiko&#39;s hands in her own.

        &quot;Thanks love,&quot; Keiko smiled back at her, &quot;but you have no idea 
what sort of resources that they can bring to bear.&quot;

        May frowned, her thoughts racing. After a few moments she 
offered, &quot;Then let&#39;s go see Juri.&quot; She smiled at Keiko&#39;s surprise, &quot;The 
Locket has friends, both in the city and beyond, and I know that Juri 
would stand by you.&quot;

        Keiko laughed softly, stroking May&#39;s cheek as she said, &quot;I must 
be getting stupid as I&#39;m getting older, not to think of that.&quot; She 
pushed herself up, pulling her shoes on once again as she said, &quot;Let&#39;s 
go over to Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.&quot;

        The black haired young woman who was leaning up against the wall 
by the door looked oddly familiar, but only on the surface. The slim 
figure nodded to them with a smile, &quot;Keiko, May, good to see you 
tonight.&quot;

        &quot;Cyber Six,&quot; May nodded with a warm smile. She tilted her head 
to the side, &quot;What are you doing out here?&quot;

        &quot;Juri asked me to play door woman tonight,&quot; Cyber Six said 
calmly, a large black panther resting nearby. She smiled slightly, &quot;Rei 
had one of her premonitions again.&quot;

        &quot;Never a good sign,&quot; Keiko noted. She looked over at Cyber Six 
thoughtfully and asked, &quot;Is Juri here tonight?&quot;

        &quot;She and Setsuna,&quot; Cyber Six agreed. She dropped her voice, &quot;And 
Hotaru is here crying in her beer because she hasn&#39;t seen Chibi-Usa in 
so long.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; May said as the two headed inside.

        &quot;Welcome to the Locket,&quot; Sasami beamed up at them, the eternally 
youthful princess of Jurai dressed in a borrowed school girl&#39;s uniform.

        &quot;Hey Sasami,&quot; Keiko waved to her casually as they headed on 
through the dancing crowds towards the bar.

        &quot;Been a long time,&quot; Minagi smiled, the blue haired woman pouring 
drinks with her usual style. Except for the scars on her cheeks she 
could have passed for her sister Ryouko, off on an diplomatic trip to 
Jurai. &quot;What&#39;ll it be?&quot; she asked.

        Keiko and May made their orders and May leaned forward to ask, 
&quot;So where&#39;s Juri tonight?&quot;

        Minagi delivered the two drinks, setting them down on the bar in 
front of the two women. &quot;Juri&#39;s got a table near the back,&quot; she nodded 
towards the read of the bar, &quot;but I think she was hoping to spend some 
time with Setsuna.&quot;

        &quot;I think she&#39;ll understand,&quot; Keiko said with a sigh. The two of 
them grabbed their drinks and moved off into the crowd, being careful 
not to spill anything.

        Arisugawa Juri and Setsuna Meiou were an odd pair on the 
surface, something heightened once you got to know them. Coming from a 
wealthy family Juri had become a Duelist at Ohtori, eventually acquiring 
a fragment of the fabled power of miracles. The orange haired woman had 
founded this bar based on a obligation to a deceased Aunt, but had found 
a place for herself here.

        Setsuna Meiou was an enigma, the beautiful black haired nurse 
and caregiver. She seemed to have a normal history but it was a lie, 
instead she was the guardian of Time, Sailor Pluto. Last survivor of a 
bygone age she was a living legend, one who had found an unexpected love 
with the beautiful woman who sat across from her.

        &quot;I hate to interrupt,&quot; May murmured, watching the two of them 
talking intently, smiles lighting up the two ladies faces.

        Keiko sighed, &quot;Me, too. But I think we&#39;re going to have to.&quot;

        Arisugawa Juri looked up as they approached, her smile warmly 
welcoming. &quot;May, Keiko,&quot; she rose, hugging May then Keiko as she quietly 
said to her, &quot;I&#39;ve been worried about you.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Keiko gave a crooked smile, once again surprised by 
her former boss&#39; warmth.

        Setsuna reached over to tug two chairs over to the table as she 
said, &quot;Grab a seat.&quot; She gave them a thoughtful look, &quot;I think it&#39;s 
important?&quot;

        &quot;How did you...?&quot; May blinked.

        &quot;She&#39;s good at reading people,&quot; Juri said calmly. She waited 
till they got their chairs before asking, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

        Keiko sighed softly, running through what she knew and the 
theories that had come out of it. She finished with, &quot;... I&#39;m worried 
going to the police will be pointless.&quot;

        &quot;Leon McNicol&#39;s running the AD Police these days,&quot; Setsuna 
called up the information easily, &quot;he&#39;s not one to bend to pressure.&quot;

        &quot;Problem is,&quot; Juri noted, &quot;he&#39;s answerable to the mayor and city 
council, all of whom are mired in corruption these days.&quot;

        &quot;And the corporations all but run the city these days,&quot; Keiko 
added glumly, &quot;if they want something they can usually get it.&quot;

        &quot;Isn&#39;t Nene Romanova running the computer crimes division in the 
AD Police?&quot; Juri asked thoughtfully, her mind clearly working.

        Setsuna nodded thoughtfully, &quot;Yes, I think so.&quot;

        &quot;Her friend Priss comes in here pretty often with Urd,&quot; Juri 
said with a impish little grin, &quot;we can pass the information to her then 
she can give it to Nene.&quot;

        &quot;That could work,&quot; May turned to Keiko eagerly.

        Keiko nodded thoughtfully, &quot;Not a bad plan at all. I&#39;ll need to 
get out a copy of the files but I should be able to do that on my shift 
tomorrow.&quot;

        &quot;Is it dangerous?&quot; Juri asked with a frown.

        &quot;No,&quot; Keiko shook her head, &quot;I&#39;m a trusted, high clearance level 
employee. I&#39;ve left with data packets before, it should be fine.&quot;

        &quot;Good,&quot; Setsuna said, but she still looked bothered.

        &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; May asked.

        Juri answered instead, &quot;Rei had one of her visions again, but it 
wasn&#39;t very specific. A big threat coming, lots of damage, but not much 
else in details.&quot;

        Setsuna gave them a wry smile, &quot;Most of the time threats to the 
Senshi don&#39;t impact normal people too much, so I wouldn&#39;t worry.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll be careful,&quot; Keiko said firmly, &quot;just in case.&quot;
