<h1>Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Revolution (part 24 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/revolution-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>Releena Peacecraft smiled grimly as she thought about
the upcoming meeting while she finished her
preperations, the brown haired young woman carefully
tying her long hair into a braid. A simple suit hugged
her slim but athletic form, the white fabric gleaming
with carefully placed gold highlights.

&#39;A bit much,&#39; Releena adjusted her gold tie, &#39;but I
guess it&#39;ll do.&#39;

With that Releena left the quarters she shared with
Arisugawa Kuri and headed down the hall, her aide
falling into place beside her. Sylvia Noventa was a
recent arrival, and oddly the daughter of a Earth
general. However, his betrayal by his own superiors
coupled with her own disillusionment lead her to the
colonies.

Sylvia&#39;s dyed red hair flowed in the gentle breeze as
she said, &quot;The representatives of the current Earth
United government and the neutral nations are waiting
in meeting room one, ma&#39;am.&quot; She hesitated, &quot;You
should know...&quot;

&quot;My brother is there?&quot; Releena guessed as they went
through a passage into a lower gravity region, the two
floating until they left the area.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Sylvia agreed. &quot;Is that going to be a
problem?&quot;

&quot;I should be fine,&quot; Releena said as they reached a new
door, two ceremonial guards waiting there. &quot;Ambassador
Releena Peacecraft and guest,&quot; she announced them,
passing over her identification.

The guard scanned it, his military cap shading his
eyes then handed them back as he crisply said, &quot;All
clear, Miss Peacecraft.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Releena tucked the papers away as the
door hissed open.

The guards and papers were a compromise the colonies
hammered out with the Earth forces. While not a
Embassy, exactly, the rooms they would be meeting in
would be treated a neutral territory, allowing for
hopefully frank discussions between various parties.

&#39;Of course,&#39; Releena thought as she scanned the room,
&#39;the attack by the mystery Gundam suit two days ago
isn&#39;t helping encourage honesty in any of us.&#39;

Sitting in chairs around the table were three men,
each one about as far apart politically as you could
get. Milliardo Peacecraft was there representing the
former kingdom of Sanc and other still independant
nations, a pale blond haired warrior who ironically
represented pacifist ideals. Trinoi Levinski was there
as a representative of the OZ organization, presumedly
chosen because he was both well respected yet also
expendable. Finally Marquis Weridge represented the
newly formed World Government, a attempt by the
Romafeller foundation to unify the world.

&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; Releena nodded as she took her seat and
asked politely, &quot;I believe you asked to see me?&quot;

&quot;Representative,&quot; Trinoi started, the old soldier
leaning forward, &quot;what the hell are you people doing,
unleashing a new Gundam?&quot;

&quot;We aren&#39;t doing anything,&quot; Releena answered him
mildly, &quot;in fact, I believe this may be a internal OZ
matter.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Weridge asked, the nobleman
looking at her sharply.

&quot;We intercepted certain communications transmitted
from Fortress Barge before it was destroyed,&quot; Releena
started.

&quot;How dare you...&quot; Trinoi tried to sound offended, but
there was a certain respect now showing in the older
man&#39;s eyes.

&quot;We are in a state of open conflict,&quot; Releena reminded
him, &quot;besides, the Barge was broadcasting their
message on emergency bands.&quot;

&quot;So what did you pick up?&quot; Milliardo calmly brought
then back on topic, his blue eyes narrowed
thoughtfully.

&quot;It appears the mystery Gundam is being piloted by a
OZ officer,&quot; Releena revealed as her assistant passed
her a print out of the broadcast, &quot;a Colonel Une.&quot;

There was a moment of dead silence as they processed
that. &quot;I presume you knew this?&quot; Weridge asked the OZ
officer flatly.

&quot;We are still trying to determine if Une was some kind
of colony plant,&quot; Trinoi answered them a bit
defensively.

&quot;Don&#39;t make me laugh,&quot; Milliardo said dryly to his
former comrade in arms, &quot;you and I know better than
that.&quot;

Releena had to nod, &quot;I had my differences with Une,
but in my experience she seemed fiercely loyal to OZ.&quot;
Shaking herself she addressed the group, &quot;So as long
as the mystery suit only attacks OZ targets, it&#39;s not
the colony&#39;s problem.&quot;

&quot;The question being, will she continue to just attack
OZ facilities in space, or does she have a larger
agenda in mind?&quot; Weridge wondered aloud.

&quot;A very good question,&quot; Releena hid a smile, knowing
that her family&#39;s old friend clearly had a point. &#39;But
until Une does do something more, the colonies can&#39;t
act,&#39; she mused.

&quot;Now,&quot; Milliardo smiled, &quot;I was wondering if the
involved parties had reviewed the Sanc kingdom&#39;s
latest peace proposal?&quot;

&quot;Preposterous,&quot; Trinoi scoffed, &quot;Oz admit to
committing war crimes? Responsible officers
surrendering to face trial at the international court?
It&#39;s a joke.&quot;

&quot;Not to the dead of the Sanc kingdom,&quot; Milliardo
reminded them, &quot;or any of the other innocents trampled
on in OZ&#39;s persuit of power and control.&quot;

&quot;Politically, we couldn&#39;t get behind such a motion,&quot;
Weridge said a bit uncomfortably.

&#39;Because Romafeller sponsored or profited from much of
that illegal activity,&#39; Releena thought, &#39;and your
World Government is heavily tied to them.&#39; Aloud she
said, &quot;While the colonies would not dream of
interfering with the internal matters of a sovereign
nation, the Sanc representative has a point.&quot;

&quot;You would side with him, considering,&quot; Trinoi
grumbled.

&quot;There is no love lost between me and Milliardo, sir,&quot;
Releena speared him with a frosty gaze, &quot;if you had
dome your research you would know that.&quot;

Trinoi met her gaze a moment, then nodded choppily,
&quot;My apologies.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Releena tried to relax a bit, aware of
how stiff her surge of anger made her. &quot;More
importantly,&quot; she continued in more normal tones, &quot;If
there is to be peace between the colonies and Earth,
we would also demand similar conditions to the Sanc
proposal.&quot;

&quot;First, the colonies would be expected to cease
hostilities,&quot; Weridge said firmly.

&quot;Ask OZ to do that first,&quot; Releena answered him dryly,
&quot;all the colonies have done so far is actively protect
ourselves from their attacks.&quot;

Weridge adjusted his tie, his black suit likely
uncomfortable in the warm lights as he said, &quot;The
presence of a military force in space is provocative,
until you disarm we cannot be certain of our own
safety.&quot;

&quot;Your damn Operation Meteor proved that,&quot; Trinoi
added.

&quot;Operation Meteor targeted OZ instilations rather than
the civilian targets you&#39;ve traditionally hit,&quot;
Releena noted. She smiled, &quot;But getting back on topic,
we colonies cannot feel safe or secure with OZ ready
to take over at a moments notice.&quot;

&quot;Stalemate,&quot; Milliardo noted after a moment, &quot;until
one or both of you are willing to make a gesture of
good faith, we won&#39;t be going anywhere.&quot;

&quot;Do you have a suggestion?&quot; Weridge asked curiously.

&quot;As we are all aware, Colonel Catalonia has been
operating in orbit, launching assaults against the
Colonies,&quot; Milliardo said smoothly. &quot;Why not command
her to cease hostilities for the time being, to show
your commitment to the peace process?&quot;

Trinoi looked at him a moment, &quot;I&#39;ll pass that
suggestion on to my superiors.&quot; He looked around, &quot;I
think we&#39;re done for today, excuse me.&quot; With that he
collected his aide and was gone out the door.

&quot;He doesn&#39;t have the authority to do that,&quot; Weridge
noted after a moment, &quot;and I doubt Catalonia would
acknowledge such a order anyway.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s that out of control?&quot; Releena noted in
surprise.

&quot;She had powerful patrons in Romafeller when I was
still Zechs,&quot; Milliardo noted, &quot;I doubt that&#39;s changed
now.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Weridge noted with a sigh.</pre>
