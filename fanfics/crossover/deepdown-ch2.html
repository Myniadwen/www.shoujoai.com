	&quot;Makoto, though I do appreciate you coming to the hospital with me, I hope 
you don&#39;t realize that I require it of you.  You should be out having fun 
like other teenagers.  Appreciate your freedom now.&quot;  Setsuna smiled 
adoringly at the young girl beside her, silently encouraging her.

	Kicking a pebble down the sidewalk, Makoto looked towards a group of 
teenagers passing on the other side of the street. &#39;It must have been them 
who gave the thought to Setsuna.&#39;  She took a deep breath, preparing her 
answer carefully, so that her guardian could understand and wouldn&#39;t bother 
her about it anymore.

	&quot;I&#39;m not a normal kid Meioh-san.  Perhaps I was never meant to be,&quot; 
stealing another glance at the teens, she continued, &quot;and besides, the older 
folks in the hospital get a kick out of me.  I like listening to their 
stories and they like telling them to me.&quot;

	Setsuna nodded, feeling that Makoto was putting her foot down about this.  
Even though it was only the young girls third visit to the hospital, she&#39;d 
already made many friends; not only with the older men and women, but the 
kids as well.  Makoto knew her way around people like Setsuna knew sewing... 
and that was saying a lot!

	The guardian had noted that ever since the chestnut haired girl came to 
live with her, she&#39;d had an uncanny sense of everyone she met or even just 
passed by on the street.  Setsuna was good at people watching, predicting 
others moods and being able to anticipate others actions before they even 
knew.  But, she conceded, was nowhere near what Makoto Kino was.

	&#39;And at such a young age...&#39;

	&quot;It&#39;s going to rain.&quot;

	Magenta eyes widened slightly, shaken from deep thought.

	Looking up, Setsuna took in the partly cloudy, but sunny skies.

	&quot;Not to disagree with you, Makoto, but the sky appears to tell otherwise,&quot; 
replied the older woman.

	Makoto closed her eyes and appeared to sniff the air with her ears.  She 
allowed the atmosphere to envelop her for a moment and then opened her eyes 
slowly again, bringing them to rest on her guardian.

	Smirking, the teen countered, &quot;We&#39;ll see.&quot;

---------------------------------------------

	The inside of the hospital was in a far less cheery disposition than the 
outside.  Doctors and nurses were in frenzy, running in all directions at 
once it seemed.  Makoto gave Setsuna a questioning glance and the dark 
haired woman could only shrug in response.  After making their way to the 
elevator, Setsuna found a nurse and began to quietly converse about the 
affair of the hospital. Meanwhile, the tall teen stood waiting patiently for 
the elevator to make it to their floor.

	&quot;You&#39;re Kino Makoto, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

	Without turning her eyes from the numbers atop the elevator doors, Makoto 
replied sternly, &quot;I am.&quot;

	The young girl seemed to be taken aback by the response and took a few 
moments of evening her breathing before going on.

	&quot;We go to the same school.  You&#39;re in my advanced science class.&quot;

	&quot;Science hmm?  That class is full of,&quot; as Makoto talked, she turned to face 
the young girl beside her, and paused a moment, before continuing, &quot;... 
idiots.&quot;

	&quot;Oh.&quot;  The blue haired girl looked shyly to the floor at a loss for words.

	Makoto took the moment to take in the sight before her.  Neatly cropped 
blue hair, held back by a barrette, lay neatly across the other girls head, 
shaping to the curves and falling almost perfectly behind and in front of 
her ears.  Though the taller girl could not see her face, she did see a pair 
of rimless glasses threatening to fall off the other girl&#39;s nose.

	Her clothes were also neatly pressed; a white button-up, long-sleeved shirt 
and a navy blue skirt that fell just past her knees.  Down her smooth legs, 
Makoto could see a pair of humble and yet pristinely white sneakers, the 
laces flawlessly tied up.

	She looks just the opposite of me...

	Looking up finally, the shorter girl spoke, &quot;I... I just wanted to introduce 
myself.  You&#39;re still new at the school and I thought you might not know 
many people yet.  My name is Mizuno Ami.&quot;

	&quot;I know who you are.&quot; Makoto answered quickly.

	Just after she&#39;d said that, Makoto regretted it.  Baby blue eyes looked 
slightly hurt and looked down again.  Makoto stared into those eyes for what 
seemed like an eternity during that second in time.  She didn&#39;t know why she 
was feeling bad for being so rude with the girl, as she was like this with 
everyone.

	&#39;She&#39;s different.&#39;

	The tall girl stopped staring at her short companion and looked to the 
left, in order to hide the shock from the thought that passed through her 
brain.  Ami didn&#39;t appear to notice this, or if she did, overlooked it.  The 
shy genius raised her eyes again, nodded and took another deep breath before 
speaking again.

	&quot;You&#39;re visiting the patients again, I see.&quot;

	Green eyes turned back to blue quickly, &quot;Yes.  Your mom works in the ER 
doesn&#39;t she?&quot;

	Makoto was doing anything to kill off the odd pauses the two were 
experiencing.  She didn&#39;t know why, but she felt slightly uncomfortable 
around the other girl.  It wasn&#39;t a bad feeling though, this was something 
else, something she&#39;d definitely not felt before.

	Nodding, Ami smiled softly, happy that Makoto didn&#39;t snap at her again.

	&quot;Makoto, our elevator is here, let&#39;s get going.&quot;

	Makoto looked to see her guardian standing in the doorway of the elevator 
and saw several people glaring at her.

	Snorting out of annoyance, she turned back to the small girl, &quot;I guess I&#39;ll 
see you around.&quot;

	&quot;It was nice talking to you, Kino-san.&quot; Ami turned and bowed gracefully to 
Setsuna.  &quot;Nice seeing you Meioh-san.&quot;

	The guardian smiled kindly and nodded her head at the blue haired girl, 
&quot;Say hello to your mother for me Ami-Chan.&quot;

	&quot;Will do.&quot;

	Makoto entered the elevator, glaring at the people giving her dirty looks 
for holding them up.  As she turned, she stared back out through the closing 
doors at this &#145;Mizuno Ami&#39;.  Once again, blue eyes met with emerald and 
Makoto couldn&#39;t turn away until the doors were shut.
