<h1>Jetiendo (part 34 of 38)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/jetiendo-ch33.html">Back to Part 33</a><pre>Ash and May wanted a simple wedding for Valentines Day, the students 
where having absolutely none of that; it has to be grand.

Ant and Dec told them all to make a list f what would make the perfect 
wedding, as Ant checked the class&#39;s work he was surprised.

&quot;I&#39;m surprised no one has mentioned booze&quot; Ant smiled,

&quot;Now using most of our plans &quot; Dec announced &quot;we&#39;ll use it for the 
wedding&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve behaved so well, &quot; Ant, said, &quot; you can pack up and go&quot;

&quot;Class dismissed,&quot; Dec said

The class left as soon as possible. TK was running to Kari as soon as 
possible, he got more than he bargained for he caught Kari and Misty 
kissing near him.

TK was horrified hoping it was just a friend-to-friend kiss like girls 
occasionally do, it wasn&#39;t, and it was a full tongue lesbian kiss, 
Kari&#39;s face turned white with pleasure, TK turned around ran away, his 
white hat fell off and landed at Misty&#39;s feet. As the kiss halted Kari 
spotted TK&#39;s hat, she picked it up slightly

&quot; T.K knows&quot; Kari moaned bitterly looking at her stomach where her baby 
was resting,

TK was banging his head on the wall, what have I done wrong to deserve 
this? I don&#39;t know who I detest the most Kari or myself. Wait a minute I 
did deserve it I took her away from Davis, I slapped her across the 
face, I raped her, I.... wait a minute she&#39;s carrying my child, yes, 
That fucking ginger twat who barely wears any clothes, Misty 
Waterflower, she&#39;s 3 years older than her. Fucking hell, I don&#39;t have a 
fucking clue, Kari I don&#39;t give a shit about you any more, you bisexual 
bloody.... I wish.... Matt was here,

To his wish Matt came in wondering what the noise was about,

&quot;TK&quot; Matt cried watching his brother cause self-harm; TK was upset.

&quot;I lost her, &quot; TK said with his head down, &quot;I lost her for someone else, 
this time it&#39;s eternal,&quot;

&quot;Someone else&quot; Matt asked, &quot;She cheated on you? Kari of all people she 
wouldn&#39;t do that with another boy&quot;

TK started staring at his brother&#39;s feet &quot;you&#39;re right &quot; he groaned &quot; 
she wouldn&#39;t do that with another boy, and NEVER while she&#39;s pregnant &quot;

&quot;Well&quot; Matt smiled &quot;why are you getting so bloody cocked up about it?&quot;

&quot; Because&quot; TK replied at his elder brother &quot; she kissed a girl&quot;

&quot;Hey&quot; Matt replied, &quot;Girls do that all the time friend-to-friend&quot;

&quot;I only wish that it was true&quot; TK hissed &quot; SHE WAS ALL OVER HER&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t let her go&quot; Matt announced &quot; Kari&#39;s carrying your child, and she 
hasn&#39;t said anything about splitting up, you need eachother, anyway I&#39;ll 
tell Tai, he&#39;ll give Kari a bit of common sense &quot;

&quot;Thanks&quot; TK said
