<h1>Night Angels Omakes (part 5 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ecoldiron.html">Elwin Blain Coldiron</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/niteangelo-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>The young lady with neck-length black hair made her way through the ruined streets of 
London, mindful of the descending sun. She could have made this trip earlier, if she didn&#39;t 
have to stand in a very long queue for groceries for the week, and now she nervously 
navigated through the burned-out cars and debris to her objective - the local chemist&#39;s 
store. Once she reached the door, she tapped on it gently, to let the elderly man who ran 
the store she was there.

&quot;What has taken you so long, Bridgett?&quot; the chemist - Angus McGregor, asked, a concerned 
tone in his voice. &quot;It&#39;s almost sunset, lass... perfect time for those ruffians roaming the 
streets nowadays to show up!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mr. McGregor,&quot; the young woman, Bridgett Healy, replied, &quot;but I needed to get my 
groceries for the week, but I had to wait in the queue at the relief centre for about three 
hours for my turn, along with everyone else. Seems that the shipment of supplies was 
hijacked and they had to wait for another supply. Anyway, were you able to get my 
prescription for tranquilizers filled? I&#39;m sorry I won&#39;t be able to pay you for it right 
now; the banks are not open yet.&quot;

Mr. McGregor chuckled, patting the girl&#39;s head, &quot;Don&#39;t worry your little heart, Bridgett. 
Your family has been coming to me ever since you were a babe-in-arms. I know since the 
attack, times are tough. You can pay me whenever you get the chance.&quot; He then reached into 
the shelves behind him and handed the girl a small bag. &quot;By-and-by, how are you dealing with 
your parents&#39; deaths?&quot;

Bridgett&#39;s face showed a sad look. &quot;It&#39;s a struggle... but I&#39;m getting through,&quot; the 
dark-haired girl said. &quot;Would like to find someplace else, though. The house may have 
survived the attack, but it&#39;s so empty without Mum and Dad around, and I&#39;m not sure if I 
wish to stay there anymore. I wish I could sleep better, though, then I wouldn&#39;t need these 
tranquilizers.&quot; She then headed for the door, adding, &quot;Anyway, I had better get back before 
the gangs show up. I&#39;ll see you... AHHHHHHHHHH!!!&quot; Just as she opened the door, four 
leather-clad males rushed through, two of them grabbing Bridgett as another aimed a gun at 
Mr. McGregor.

&quot;&#39;Bout time you&#39;ve opened th&#39; door, y&#39; little bitch!&quot; the gun-wielding thug, one who sported 
a blonde Mohawk, snarled. &quot;Alright ol&#39; man, &#39;ow about &#39;andin&#39; ov&#39;r th&#39; OxyContin!&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; the old chemist demanded, only to get pistol-whipped for his 
trouble.

&quot;Don&#39; give us any fuckin&#39; guff, Gramps, y&#39; know wot we mean! Now shut yer gob, get behind 
th&#39; counter an&#39; give us all yer OxyContin!&quot;

Getting back to his feet, Mr. McGregor wiped the blood from his face and sputtered, &quot;I-I 
don&#39;t dispense OxyContin! It&#39;s too risky!&quot;

&quot;No OxyContin?&quot; the thug repeated, incredulous. &quot;Th&#39;t&#39;s bloody ridiculous! Yer a fuckin&#39; 
chemist, y&#39; should &#39;ave it!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t dispense opiate-based pain pharmaceuticals stronger than codeine in this 
establishment!&quot; Mr. McGregor pleaded. &quot;No OxyContin, and no Percoset, Percodan or Roxicodone 
either! Didn&#39;t you read the sign?&quot; He pointed to a sign in the window, clearly stating what 
he said.

The Mohawked thug just shrugged and answered, &quot;I can&#39;t read!&quot; Then he shot the old man twice 
in the head, causing Bridgett to scream in horror.

&quot;NOOOOOO!!!! MR. MCGREGOR!?!?!&quot; Then she was silenced when the thug not holding her 
back-handed her... hard.

&quot;Shut up, bitch!&quot; one of the thugs snarled.

&quot;Say Stig,&quot; another, a spiky redhead, said as the Mohawked shooter began opening bottles of 
rubbing alcohol and emptying them all over, as well as on the body, &quot;just what are w&#39; 
supposed t&#39; do with th&#39;s bird?&quot;

&quot;Put &#39;er in th&#39; car, Reg,&quot; Stig replied, lighting a Molotov cocktail. &quot;When w&#39;re a good 
distance away from &#39;ere, w&#39;ll think o&#39; somthin&#39;.&quot; He then threw the bottle against the wall, 
the gasoline inside igniting as it scattered around the alcohol-soaked shop.

Hurrying away from the burning shop, the four stuffed a groggy Bridgett inside the back of a 
waiting sedan, the young girl watching in horror as flames licked the open door. Slamming 
the doors, the car then sped-off - unaware that other eyes were watching them from the 
rooftops.

XXX

She was wearing an outfit her friends/lovers, the vampires Irene &#39;Rally&#39; Vincent and Seras 
Victoria had given her on her twentieth birthday - a skin-tight non-reflective black 
jumpsuit, the collar open in such a way that had exposed her generous cleavage. When she 
first wore the suit, Moria Hedgley felt a little embarrassed about it, despite the 
assurances of her late father Kenneth that it reminded him of a character from an old 
television show. However, she had to admit that the outfit allowed her to move with greater 
flexibility than normal clothes and was more durable than others she wore - and she took 
advantage of this as she morphed herself into her mid-level form, still human but also 
wolf-like, which afforded her greater stamina and agility for the chase.

She had taken up many skills when she had became a part-time agent of the Hellsing 
Organization - one of these was parkour, or free-running, and Moria used that skill to 
follow the car, making sure she was not spotted. Leaping off roofs and building walls with a 
grace the most accomplished traceur (male) or traceuse(female) of the sport could envy, she 
tracked the car for a good five kilometers, where it backed into a blind alleyway. 
Positioning herself near the entrance, Moria watched with rapt interest, at the same time 
briefly concentrating.

The four thugs forcibly pulled Bridgett from the car, the girl clearly terrified. &quot;&#39;Ell, wot 
are w&#39; gonna do, Stig?&quot; one of the four, a greasy black-haired one, asked. &quot;Th&#39; guys back at 
th&#39; ware&#39;ouse was expectin&#39; t&#39; bring back OxyContin! &#39;Ow are w&#39; gonna explain t&#39; Holly about 
it?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39; worry, Nigel,&quot; Stig explained. &quot;Th&#39; night&#39;s still young, an&#39; there are still plenty o&#39; 
chemists t&#39; hit. &#39;E can wait a little longer.&quot; He then leered over Bridgett and added, &quot;But 
in th&#39; meantime,&quot; he started tearing at her blouse, &quot;w&#39; can &#39;ave a little fun with &#39;er!&quot; 
Soon, the remaining thugs began pawing at her, tearing off various parts of her clothing.

In the meantime, Bridgett was in a blind panic, horrified at the thought of being violently 
raped by four strangers. &quot;NOOOO!!! PLEASE LET ME GOOO!!&quot; she pleaded, &quot;NOOOO!!! NOOOOO!!!!&quot;

&quot;LET HER GO, BASTARDS!!!&quot; Both hoods and potential victim turned around as Moria, quickly 
shifting to her human form, bounded off the roofs and landed at the alley&#39;s entrance. Since 
the light was behind her, Moria was grateful that her silver-gray fur couldn&#39;t be seen as it 
retreated - at least until she wanted them to see it. &quot;You&#39;ve been terrorizing this city for 
far too long,&quot; she announced, &quot;and tonight, it&#39;s going to end! However, being that I&#39;m a 
practicing Christian, I&#39;ll offer you this: repent your sins against the citizens of this 
city and I might consider leaving you be!&quot; All she got was a round of raucous laughter from 
the thugs. &quot;Just what do you think is so funny?&quot; she demanded in an annoyed voice, her right 
eyebrow twitching.

&quot;Fer y&#39;r information, y&#39; stupid bitch,&quot; Stig laughed, still holding Bridgett, &quot;God &#39;as taken 
a dump on th&#39;s shitty burg, if y&#39; &#39;aven&#39;t see it! Almost all th&#39; pigs are dead, which means 
w&#39; can do anythin&#39; w&#39; please, whenever w&#39; please!&quot; Waving his hand around, he announced, 
&quot;Th&#39;s is a whole new world w&#39;re livin&#39; in, sister - one without th&#39; annoyin&#39; rules th&#39;t w&#39;re 
put in place by th&#39; ol&#39; fogies runnin&#39; t&#39;is town before they got killed!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not entirely true!&quot; Moria countered. &quot;The military is currently making sure order is 
still in this city! True, they&#39;re few in number and are currently overburdened with that 
task, so they cannot be everywhere - which is why someone like myself and others has taken 
upon ourselves to make sure disreputable types like you four idiots cannot run roughshod 
over my precious London!&quot; At the same time, however, Moria maneuvered herself around the 
five until her back was to the bricked wall. &#39;That&#39;s it, Moria,&#39; she thought to herself, 
&#39;let those four bloody savages holding that poor girl think you&#39;ve gone completely bonkers, 
moving away from your escape path!&#39; She also took note at the mens&#39; leering looks. &#39;I would 
wager that these wankers are the type to think with their GONADS rather than their BRAINS by 
the way they&#39;re eyeing my body!&#39; she mentally added with a smile. &#39;Makes the hunt all the 
better!&#39;

&quot;Is th&#39;t so?&quot; Nigel said smugly. &quot;Stig, make sure this bitch doesn&#39;t go anywhere,&quot; 
indicating to Bridgett as he, as well as two others, advanced towards Moria. Quickly, Mike, 
a youth with sandy brown hair and Reg raced forward and grabbed Moria by her arms as Nigel 
walked in front of her... just as she expected. &quot;I believe th&#39;t before w&#39; take care o&#39; th&#39; 
little one,&quot; he said, &quot;w&#39; should warm ourselves up with th&#39; likes o&#39; you!&quot; He eyed Moria&#39;s 
large breasts hungrily. &quot;Wi&#39; those big tits o&#39; yours, I believe w&#39; can be ready for more!&quot;

&quot;Is that what you believe?&quot; Moria countered defiantly, lightly stamping the back of her 
right heel, which produced a barely-perceptible metallic click. &quot;Well, I believe I may prove 
you wrong!&quot; And with that, she forcefully brought-up her right foot until it connected with 
the underside of Nigel&#39;s groin - hard! A look of shock then came over his face as the tip of 
her boot impacted.

&quot;Aw shit!&quot; Mike, the thug to Moria&#39;s right, groaned. &quot;Looks like Nigel got &#39;is nuts kicked! 
Well, I guess it&#39;s my turn then while &#39;e recovers!&quot;

&quot;Mike... look at Nigel&#39;s face!&quot; Reg said, noticing a look of pain that was unlike that of 
one whose testicles were kicked. What they failed to notice, though, was there was a bit of 
blood dripping from the impact site.

&quot;Find it interesting, gents?&quot; Moria asked, smiling sweetly. &quot;Then you&#39;ll love this!&quot; She 
then twisted her foot around and upward, blood spraying from where Nigel was kicked, the 
thug falling to the ground with a loud scream.

&quot;Y&#39; BITCH!!!&quot; Mike snarled, looking at Moria poisonously. &quot;WOT DID Y&#39; DO T&#39; &#39;IM!?! DID Y&#39; 
CASTRATE NIGEL!?!&quot;

&quot;Worse than that,&quot; Moria answered, stamping the back of her right heel to retract the 
five-inch knife blade protruding from the boot tip, &quot;I&#39;ve severed his femoral artery! His 
death should occur within a few seconds!&quot; Indeed, Nigel quivered for a few seconds before 
finally relaxing, his last breath coming as a raspy gasp.

Stig, still holding Bridgett, was in shock seeing his companion die. Then his shock turned 
to rage. &quot;Y&#39; FUCKIN&#39; BITCH!!!!&quot; he yelled as he shot Moria in the open space between her 
breasts. Bridgett screamed briefly, but stopped when she saw that Moria didn&#39;t fall. 
Instead, the black-clad woman, whose head was down, just trembled on her feet, the 
through-and-through wound healing quickly as it did.

&quot;You bloody bastards!&quot; Moria snarled, finally lifting her head. The four were shocked to see 
her emerald-green eyes became bluish-white - and even more shocked to see fangs in her 
teeth. &quot;I was going to offer you how you wish to die - quick and painless or slow and 
agonizing. But with that stupid little stunt you pulled, you&#39;ve already made your choice... 
slow and agonizing it is!&quot;

&quot;Reg,&quot; Mike said, nervously looking at a rapidly-transforming Moria, &quot;look at th&#39; bitch&#39;s 
eyes!&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Reg added, noticing fur sprouting from Moria, &quot;I&#39;m totally gobsmack at th&#39;s! Let&#39;s 
get out o&#39; &#39;ere!&quot; Quickly, Reg released her left arm and ran for all his worth. However, 
this caused the young werewolf to grab Mike with it and spinning him around to face her. The 
young thug screamed, seeing her head transforming into one looking like a wolf.

If she could, Moria would be smiling, noticing that Mike&#39;s bladder chose that moment to lose 
control, if the smell of fresh urine wafting into her lupine nostrils was of any indication. 
With a great howl, she lunged, clamping her large jaws onto his face - and ripping it off! 
Still screaming, blinded by his own blood, Mike tried to run, only to get his right arm 
ripped-off. Stumbling, the thug fell to the ground as Moria proceeded to tear him limb from 
limb.

During this orgy of slaughter, Stig and Reg - with Bridgett behind them - took advantage of 
the distraction and ran from the alley, cut-off from the car by the carnage behind them. 
&quot;Wot are y&#39; doin&#39; runnin&#39; wit&#39; us, bitch!?!&quot; Stig managed to yell at the girl, who was able 
to keep her torn clothes on her body.

&quot;It&#39;s not that I like being with the likes of you!&quot; Bridgett shouted back as she ran. &quot;It&#39;s 
just that I don&#39;t have any desire to die!&quot;

&quot;Y&#39;ll get no argument there!&quot; Reg added. &quot;Stig, w&#39; better split-up and get back t&#39; th&#39; 
ware&#39;ouse!&quot; Stig didn&#39;t answer, instead nodding and going in another direction. Reg, with 
Bridgett on his tail, continued on the same path... until a black-gloved hand grabbed his 
right arm and pulled him into a fire-damaged building.

Curious about what happened, Bridgett stopped in her tracks - and nearly screamed. Inside, 
Rally, her entire Hellsing uniform coal black, had her fangs sunk deeply into Reg&#39;s neck, 
draining the very life from him. Reg, for his part, could only utter a strangled gurgle 
before going limp in the dusky vampire&#39;s arms. Rally then craned her head, ecstatic upon 
feeling the infusion of fresh, warm blood coursing into her body, with all the memories and 
experiences it carried, before she violently tore Reg&#39;s head from his body, to prevent him 
from rising as a ghoul.

Watching all this, Bridgett tried to will herself to run, but the terror of the moment 
seemed to have paralyzed her legs. Then she saw Rally look at her, the blazing orange-red of 
her eyes seeming to burrow into her very soul. &quot;So... what do you think about what I did to 
your boyfriend... you little bitch!&quot; she growled, a hungry smile on her face.

Hearing the very menace of Rally&#39;s voice, Bridgett realized her mistake of following Reg in 
the first place - the vampire seemed to think she was in alliance with the punk! &quot;Y-y-y-you 
don&#39;t seem to understand...&quot; she managed to stammer.

&quot;Really, do you think I expect to believe all that after your friends killed the Hellsing 
family&#39;s chemist?&quot; Rally snarled, grabbing Bridgett by both shoulders.

Moria, in the meantime, had finished reducing Mike to a pile of broken body parts and torn 
viscera. Satisfied, she allowed herself to return to human form, her battle outfit 
concealing the spattered blood of her victim.

Then, as if she heard a bell in the distance, the werewolf turned to the alley entrance. &quot;Oh 
my god!&quot; Moria said to herself, racing for the street. &quot;I better stop Rally before she makes 
a grave mistake!&quot;

XXX

&quot;Please, you have to understand!&quot; Bridgett pleaded, finding herself staring at Rally&#39;s 
glowing eyes, the pupils narrowed into thin slits. &quot;I had no part of the matter! I was only 
running with him because I didn&#39;t wish to be killed by that wolf woman!&quot;

All she got was a cruel smirk from Rally. &quot;You know,&quot; she purred at the struggling girl, &quot;I 
really should thank Moria for not killing you. The week&#39;s events had left me very hungry!&quot; 
Bridgett continued to plead, but screamed when she felt Rally&#39;s fangs sink deeply into her 
neck.

But just as she took two massive swallows of blood, Rally stopped and pulled back, shocked. 
&quot;Oh... fuck! You... you weren&#39;t lying!&quot; she gasped, a look of horror on her face.

Bridgett, woozy from loss of blood, looked at the vampire, who was in shock of what she did. 
&quot;Please... I have no wish to die,&quot; she said in a low voice. &quot;I don&#39;t want to die.&quot;

Rally could only shake her head, bloody tears streaming from her eyes. &quot;No... no! What 
have... what have I done?&quot; she managed to choke-out.

&quot;RALLY!!! DON&#39;T HURT THAT GIRL!!!&quot; Turning, Rally saw Moria race inside, a look of concern 
on her face - which was replaced by shock upon seeing the puncture marks on the girl&#39;s neck. 
&quot;Oh no! Rally... you didn&#39;t...?&quot;

&quot;Huh? What?&quot; Then Rally regained her composure briefly. &quot;Oh... don&#39;t worry Moria, she&#39;s 
still alive.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what I&#39;m concerned about!&quot; Moria said. &quot;What... what if your bite changes this 
girl into a ghoul?&quot;

Rally shook her head. &quot;There&#39;s no way it&#39;ll happen,&quot; she answered glumly. &quot;She&#39;s still a 
virgin. I could tell when I...&quot; She then noticed that Bridgett had flinched seeing Moria. 
&quot;Hey, are... are you going to be alright?&quot; she asked, looking at the young girl.

&quot;I... just don&#39;t want to die,&quot; was all Bridgett could say.

&quot;And you won&#39;t die. I guarantee it... Bridgett,&quot; Rally said.

Now Bridgett was confused. &quot;How... how did you know my name?&quot; she asked, confused.

&quot;Your blood told me, just as it told me that you were innocent of Mr. McGregor&#39;s death,&quot; 
answered the dusky vampire in a soothing voice, whose eyes began to glow brighter. &quot;Now what 
I want you to do is to go to sleep - and dream of happier times. I&#39;ll let you know when to 
wake-up.&quot; Immedietly, the girl felt her eyelids becoming heavier, then closing altogether as 
she slumped into Rally&#39;s arms. &quot;Moria,&quot; she said, &quot;could you carry her to the car?&quot;

&quot;Yes, my lovely,&quot; Moria replied, taking the sleeping girl and carrying her a short distance 
to the Cobra, which was parked in a nearby alley. As she gently positioned Bridgett into the 
cramped back seat, she couldn&#39;t help to notice Rally&#39;s sour mood and was worried if she 
would lash-out because of her mistake.

The explosion came quickly. Rally was standing next to a wrecked light standard while Moria 
was busy with Bridgett. Quite suddenly, the vampire slammed the back of her fist into it, 
bending it at the impact site. &quot;DAMMIT, I REALLY SCREWED-UP THIS TIME!!!&quot; she yelled to no 
one in particular. &quot;INTEGRA&#39;S GOING TO HAVE MY ASS FOR THIS!!!&quot;

Finished with her task, Moria raced behind Rally, embracing her from behind. &quot;Rally dear,&quot; 
she began, &quot;I sure Sir Integra will understand the situation once we explain it to her.&quot;

Rally still wasn&#39;t convinced. &quot;Moria, you&#39;ve worked for Integra long enough to know that she 
doesn&#39;t tolerate screw-ups,&quot; she said, &quot;especially if a vampire commits it!&quot; The bloody 
tears resumed as Rally added, &quot;And besides... I&#39;ve hurt an innocent human! Do you really 
expect me to forgive myself for that?&quot;

&quot;Give it time, Rally,&quot; Moria replied, finding a tissue to clean Rally&#39;s face, &quot;that&#39;s all I 
can say.&quot; Once satisfied, she then asked, &quot;Why don&#39;t I drive? You look really out of it.&quot;

Still feeling a bit glum, Rally managed a small smile as she gave Moria the keys to the 
Cobra. &quot;Yeah, why not?&quot;

As she got into the driver&#39;s seat, another thought came to Moria&#39;s head. &quot;Too bad you didn&#39;t 
get a chance to find-out where those gangsters are holed-up. Could make our job eradicating 
them easier.&quot;

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry about that, Moria,&quot; Rally answered as she seated herself besides her 
friend/lover. &quot;When I drank that punk&#39;s blood, I found their address through it. I&#39;ve 
already contacted Master mentally about the location and she&#39;s headed there right now. But 
she said she&#39;ll wait until near sunrise before starting.&quot; The dusky vampire smiled, &quot;She 
told me, &#39;It&#39;s best to wait until the rest of the rats return to the nest before wiping them 
out&#39;.&quot;

&quot;How brutally efficient Seras is,&quot; Moria said, starting the car. Turning to face Rally, she 
saw that the dusky vampire was again in telepathic communication with her master, which was 
followed by a look of relief. &quot;I take it that you&#39;ve just received good news,&quot; she asked.

Rally nodded, smiling. &quot;Master told Integra about my little gaffe here,&quot; she said, looking 
into the back seat where Bridgett was sleeping. &quot;Integra said not to worry too much about 
it; just get the girl to the mansion, then to the task at hand. She&#39;ll think of something 
afterwards.&quot; Moria didn&#39;t reply, but smiled nonetheless as she put the Cobra into gear.

THE WAREHOUSE DISTRICT, NEAR SUNRISE...

&quot;... But I&#39;m tellin&#39; y&#39; th&#39; truth, Holly!&quot; Stig pleaded to his boss, a youth with a 
multi-colored hairdoo, &quot;Th&#39;s bitch up and turned into th&#39;s wolf thing an&#39; tore Mike t&#39; bits 
after she killed Nigel with th&#39; knife in &#39;er boot!&quot;

The occupants of the abandoned warehouse, which numbered at least over two hundred, just 
laughed as Stig related his tale. &quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Holly said, lounging of several crates, &quot;all 
th&#39;s t&#39; explain away why th&#39; four o&#39; y&#39; could get away from knockin&#39; over a couple o&#39; 
chemists.&quot; Lowering his head, he just covered his eyes with his hand before grumbling, 
&quot;Fuck! An&#39; I was lookin&#39; forward t&#39; gettin&#39; high tonight!&quot; Then he remembered something. &quot;Y&#39; 
hear anythin&#39; from Reg yet?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Now th&#39;t y&#39; mentioned it,&quot; Stig began, &quot;&#39;E is a bit late.&quot; Going to the access leading to 
one of the Underground&#39;s tunnels, he added, &quot;I&#39;ll see if &#39;e made it out.&quot; He soon 
disappeared inside.

A few minutes passed before one of the thugs inside walks up to Holly and asks, &quot;So, what d&#39; 
y&#39; think about Stig&#39;s story?&quot;

Holly just shrugged. &quot;Th&#39; guy&#39;s good in a fight - but he&#39;s also a bloody retard!&quot; he said. 
&quot;Th&#39;t story o&#39; &#39;is &#39;s a bit &#39;ard t&#39; swallow. If y&#39; ask me, I&#39;d say Stig and th&#39; others got 
wasted an&#39; th&#39; others O.D.&#39;ed, so &#39;e &#39;ad t&#39; make-up t&#39;is bit o&#39; bullshit t&#39; explain it.&quot; He 
might have added more... but as soon as the doors of the warehouse closed for the night, the 
shadows inside seemed to writhe on their own accord, covering the walls as they did.

&quot;Oi... wot gives?&quot; one of them called-out.

&quot;Indeed, what gives gentlemen?&quot; another voice, a female one replied. Everyone turned to the 
source, only to see Seras, wearing her blood-red Hellsing uniform, walk towards them, an 
evil smile on her face. &quot;The whole lot of you have had an easy time of it with your 
mischief, after Millennium wrecked this city... but no more!&quot;

There were a few snickers from the group as Holly asked, &quot;An&#39; just wot th&#39; fuck d&#39; y&#39; think 
y&#39;re are, you little bitch?&quot;

&quot;Your death, what else?&quot; Seras replied, still smiling.

&quot;Oi...d&#39; y&#39; see what I DON&#39;T see about &#39;er?&quot; the punk near Holly said in a trembling voice.

Holly nodded. &quot;Yeah... &#39;er left arm!&quot; In the darkness, the nebulous ebony mass that replaced 
the No-Life Queen&#39;s left arm was invisible in the blackness she created... which was perfect 
for her.

Seras picked her targets; twenty of the punks behind Holly, which she used her darkwing to 
form tendrils -which they couldn&#39;t see in the darkness - and quickly lashed-out and sliced 
them to pieces. Before Holly could react, Seras was upon him, her fangs penetrating his 
neck, quickly draining his blood before she used them to rip his head off - much like 
Alucard had done to the Rio S.W.A.T. team that attacked him and her more than two weeks ago!

From then on, it was a one-sided slaughter, the thugs trying to no avail to kill Seras, only 
to be killed themselves either by getting their blood drained or their bodies being torn or 
cut to pieces. And throughout it all, Seras maniacally laughed seeing the carnage she was 
wreaking. &quot;Can you see it, Master?&quot; the No-Life Queen gleefully called-out as she tore more 
bodies. &quot;Can you see these humans being slaughtered by me? I imagined you thought it 
impossible!!&quot;

&#39;On the contrary, I knew you had it in you... you just needed the push to do it, Seras.&#39; 
Seras paused briefly - the voice of Alucard was sounding within her head. &#39;You do me proud, 
my Police Girl! You&#39;ve truly become the ultimate killing machine to be feared by living and 
undead alike!&#39;

&#39;I&#39;m glad you think so, Master,&#39; Seras mentally replied, smiling as she ripped a thug&#39;s head 
from it&#39;s shoulders.

&#39;But Seras,&#39; Alucard further added, &#39;I suggest you don&#39;t get TOO greedy in killing these 
pathetic humans, for I suspect that your apprentice may want her share when she arrives 
right about... now!&#39;

As if on cue, Rally landed next to Seras, still dressed in her black Hellsing uniform. &quot;I 
hope you haven&#39;t killed all of them, Master,&quot; she said, a murderous look on her face. &quot;I 
have a need to get-out a few frustrations I developed tonight... and these assholes are the 
perfect outlet for it!&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry too much, my dear Rally,&quot; the No-Life Queen replied. &quot;There&#39;s still plenty 
of them around, so...&quot; But before she could finish, Rally raced into the surviving throng - 
and the amount of violence she unleashed was even more than what Seras had done! &#39;Oh dear!&#39; 
she thought to herself, shocked at Rally&#39;s viciousness. &#39;I... I guess the incident earlier 
is still weighing heavily on her mind!&#39;

&#39;A fair assumption to be sure, Police Girl,&#39; came the disembodied reply from Alucard. Seras 
didn&#39;t reply, instead joining Rally in the massacre.

However, even a vampire cannot be in all places at once. Three of the thugs had somehow 
managed to find the door to the warehouse and were now frantically trying to get clear. 
&quot;Fuck!&quot; one of them gasped. &quot;Didn&#39;t expect TH&#39;T ONE!&quot;

&quot;Y&#39; said it!&quot; another said. &quot;It&#39;s a bloody miracle w&#39; w&#39;re able t&#39; get outta th&#39;t one!&quot;

The third then turned to the first and asked, &quot;D&#39; y&#39; think th&#39;t was one o&#39; th&#39; bitches in 
Stig&#39;s story?&quot;

&quot;&#39;Ho cares if she is, I&#39;m just fuckin&#39; glad I&#39;m not th&#39; one gettin&#39; me arse handed t&#39; me on 
a platter!&quot; the first thug said.

&quot;Well wotever, let&#39;s see if w&#39; can find th&#39;t other gang...&quot; But before he could complete his 
sentence, the second thug got caught by a blackish blur, followed by blood spraying from his 
throat.

&quot;BARRY!!!&quot; Quickly, the other two stopped in their tracks to check on their companion. 
Barry&#39;s throat had been opened up to a depth of two inches, what remained of his larynx 
hanging out of the wound.

&quot;If you ask me,&quot; Moria&#39;s voice came from behind the surviving two, &quot;the little bugger got 
off easy!&quot; Both them turned. Moria, in her transitional human/wolf form, licked the blood 
from her clawed fingers. &quot;I would&#39;ve preferred him to die slowly and painfully, but he was 
running too quickly to do so.&quot; She then eyed the remaining two predatorily, adding, &quot;So now 
you gents, on the other hand, will have to do!&quot; She then laughed, &quot;After all, it isn&#39;t a 
true massacre if there are survivors ambling about, now is it?&quot;

The last thing the two thugs saw was Moria charging towards them, grinning from 
ear-to-furred ear.

SUNRISE, THE NEXT EVENING...

The reason why Bridgett had visited Mr. McGregor&#39;s shop was to drop-of a prescription for 
tranquilizers the doctor she visited, Dr. Trevelyan, had given her. During the massacre 
Millennium had instituted, she and her parents had been caught-up in the chaos that 
resulted, and were in the streets when Iscariot arrived - and Archbishop Enrico Maxwell 
announced that the citizens of London were to be executed as heretics!

The first barrage Iscariot&#39;s elite corp of paladins unleashed had killed Bridgett&#39;s parents 
instantly. Bridgett, who was only slightly wounded, somehow managed to remain still next to 
her mother&#39;s lifeless body as the paladins began shooting whoever survived. She might have 
been next if Alucard hadn&#39;t chosen that moment to make his appearance and obliterated the 
priests with his familiars.

For the days after that, it was a struggle for Bridgett. The family house survived the 
onslaught, but she found it hard sleeping there, as if waiting for the attackers to come 
back. And when she did sleep, it just meant dealing with horrible nightmares, with the 
undead and living attackers distorted in the most unthinkable ways.

But this night was different. For the first time in many nights, Bridgett&#39;s dreams were 
pleasant, often happy slideshows of holidays past. For instance many scenes of Mother 
preparing the annual Christmas goose with all her favorite trimmings, or her father teaching 
her how to fire a handgun, despite her mother&#39;s half-hearted objections. There were also 
scenes of the family annual trips to the Dover coast, and the three of them marveling on the 
waters of the English Channel crashing around the white chalk cliffs. There were also scenes 
of the family exploring England and Wales&#39; prehistoric past, sites that long proceeded the 
Romans&#39; invasion of these islands.

&#39;Bridgett... you can wake-up now.&#39;

Slowly, Bridgett opened her eyes, somehow surprised by her new surroundings. She wasn&#39;t in 
her bedroom, instead awakening in a somewhat-disheveled, yet tastefully decorated, bedroom. 
Turning her head, she looked over and saw the sun - and was surprised to see it was setting, 
not rising.

She then turned her head the other way. She saw Rally, in her yellow Hellsing uniform.

&quot;AAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!&quot;

&quot;You are too loud!&quot; Surprised at this new voice, Bridgett bolted upward and saw a dusky, 
exotically-beautiful, pale blonde-haired woman in a grayish-green business suit looking at 
her. &quot;I do not care about the circumstances of your presence here! You are still English! 
Have some manners!&quot;

This was almost too much to bear! Trying to comprehend, Bridgett decided to have a closer 
look at her host. As observed before, she was wearing a somewhat-masculine suit, and the 
black eyepatch she wore over her left eye only seem to add an air of mystery - or maybe a 
sense of strength - to this odd woman. &quot;Uh... pardon me,&quot; she began, finally noticing she 
was wearing silk pajamas, &quot;but... I was wondering... who are you? And... where am I?&quot;

&quot;I never thought you asked,&quot; the strange woman said. &quot;I am Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates 
Hellsing, and you are at my mansion.&quot;

Bridgett just looked at her host oddly. &quot;Sir... Hellsing?&quot; she asked.

&quot;It does sound odd, a woman with a masculine title, but I will make it clear to you in due 
time.&quot; Sir Integra then indicated to Rally, who had a sullen look on her face. &quot;Right now, 
my friend here would like to have a word-or-two with you.&quot;

Bridgett cringed, recognizing the vampire that attacked her and drank her blood. But before 
she could do anything, she heard Rally mutter, &quot;I&#39;m... sorry.&quot;

&quot;Pardon?&quot; the black-haired girl asked, blinking.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I attacked you last night,&quot; Rally said, sounding contrite. &quot;I saw you running 
with that thug and thought you were his girlfriend. I only found-out when I tasted your 
blood. I...&quot; Rally nearly choked on her words, bloody tears forming from her eyes, &quot;I acted 
rashly. I should&#39;ve thought before...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s alright,&quot; Bridgett said, cutting Rally off. &quot;Like you said, you thought I was an 
acquaintance of those monsters, so it&#39;s understandable.&quot;

&quot;If truth be told,&quot; Moria added, entering the room, &quot;I, as well, bear some blame for the 
misunderstanding.&quot; Moria&#39;s clothing was changed: she was now wearing the same garb the late 
Walter C. Dolnez wore, the sole exception a knee-length pleated gray skirt instead of 
slacks. &quot;Sir Integra,&quot; she said, indicating a tray she was carrying, which held a carafe of 
ice water, an amber bottle - and two file folders, &quot;it&#39;s time for your antibiotics.&quot;

Briefly, Sir Integra chuckled. &quot;I guess there is no escaping Dr. Trevelyan&#39;s responsibility 
for me,&quot; she said. Bridgett blinked, remembering the doctor who gave her the prescription. 
&quot;One moment, please?&quot; She then opened the bottle, extracting a tablet, which she swallowed 
with a glass of water Moria poured her.

It was then that Bridgett recognized the label on the bottle. &quot;That... that was from Mr. 
McGregor&#39;s shop!&quot; she exclaimed.

&quot;How observant of you,&quot; Sir Integra added, setting down the glass. &quot;Angus McGregor was a 
good friend of my father, Sir Arthur Hellsing, and once served the Hellsing Organization for 
a brief time before he was injured. It was out of gratitude that my father had financed his 
attendance in college to obtain his chemist&#39;s license.&quot;

&quot;He never told me that part of his life,&quot; Bridgett said, impressed. &quot;All I know of him was 
that he and his wife were good friends of my family.&quot; A tear in her eye rolled down her 
cheek as she continued, &quot;Mum told me he was there at my Christening, and he was an active 
member our local church. And last year, when his wife died, my family attended her funeral. 
I recall there was quite a few people there. Like there was this one woman who...&quot; She then 
looked at Sir Integra closely, which caused her eyes to light-up. &quot;YOU were there at her 
funeral, also!&quot;

&quot;Indeed I was,&quot; Sir Integra agreed, a tone of sadness in her voice. &quot;And just this morning, 
I was called by the army to identify his burned corpse that was pulled for his shop. Mind 
you, it was a very unpleasant task.&quot; She then composed herself and added, &quot;Now, for the 
reason why you are here, it is because I have an offer for you.&quot;

&quot;Me?&quot; Bridgett repeated, confused.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the Hellsing leader answered as Moria handed her one of the folders. &quot;The recent 
tragedy has depleted my household staff and I was wondering if you would help replenish it 
as one of the maids here.&quot; She went over the paperwork in the folder with a practiced eye 
and added, &quot;Thankfully, the cleaning service you worked for part-time is still in operation 
and I had your records brought over. A very impressive resume, I must add.&quot;

&quot;I... I guess,&quot; Bridgett gushed modestly.

&quot;And that is not all,&quot; Sir Integra added. &quot;Through your blood, Rally has told me about your 
current living arrangements... as well as the tragedy you suffered as a result of Iscariot&#39;s 
outrage against the English people. In exchange for your services to my household, I am 
willing to offer you my hospitality.&quot; She then looked at the girl directly, &quot;Believe me... I 
know the feeling of not having family to live with. And I can tell you that I can use your 
company.&quot;

Bridgett thought over Sir Integra&#39;s offer very carefully, then said, &quot;But that also means 
that...&quot; she looked at Rally and Moria uneasily, &quot;... that I have to share a roof with... 
her,&quot; she pointed to the dusky vampire, then at Moria, &quot;and this wolf woman?&quot;

&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; Moria interjected. &quot;My name is Moria Hedgley, not &#39;wolf woman&#39;. And 
since I&#39;m to be your direct supervisor, I would thank you to remember my name, Miss Healy. 
Do I make myself clear?&quot; Taken aback, Bridgett nodded.

&#39;What did I tell you, Moria?&#39; Rally mentally said, smiling. &#39;You&#39;re a natural for this job!&#39;

&#39;Oh please, Rally,&#39; Moria added, also smiling, &#39;you&#39;re being way too generous in your 
assessment of my skills.&#39;

&#39;But you do it so well, my dear.&#39;

During this time, Bridgett was looking at Rally and Moria, a confused look on her face. 
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; she began, &quot;but I noticed you two are talking but your lips were not moving. 
How in the world are you doing this?&quot; Shocked, Rally and Moria looked at Bridgett, then at 
each other. After a while, the dusky vampire had an uncomfortable look on her face, with her 
werewolf lover looking sympathetic.

Sir Integra also noticed. &quot;I see,&quot; she said. &quot;Well, I am certain Rally could explain this... 
trait to you in due time.&quot; Looking at the other folder on the tray, she looked to Moria and 
added, &quot;That would be the intelligence report on the other gang, is it not?&quot;

&quot;It is, Sir Integra,&quot; answered Moria, &quot;but I would suggest waiting until Seras has arrived.&quot;

&quot;Then you won&#39;t have to wait too long, Moria dear,&quot; Seras&#39; disembodied voice replied, 
followed by the No-Life Queen walking through the wall of the bedroom. Although surprised by 
this newcomer, Bridgett held her ground. Although the orange-red eyes of Seras seemed to 
bore through her soul, the young girl didn&#39;t flinch, eyeing the red-clad vampiress equally. 
&quot;You may be frightened by my appearance,&quot; Seras began, smiling, &quot;but you&#39;re able to conceal 
it well. Mind you, though, since we&#39;re going to be sharing the same roof, you&#39;re going to 
have to expect more of the same.&quot;

Bridgett nodded. &quot;Um... what&#39;s happened to your arm?&quot; she asked, pointing to the shifting 
ebony mass in place of Seras&#39; left arm.

&quot;A long story. As soon as you&#39;re comfortable here, I&#39;ll tell you... but not now.&quot; Seras then 
shifted her attention to Sir Integra. &quot;You called me, master of my master?&quot;

&quot;Indeed I have, Seras.&quot; Sir Integra then turned to Moria. &quot;Go on.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Moria opened the folder. &quot;First of all, we were complimented on the quickness 
of last night&#39;s mission, although we did receive one complaint from a regimental commander 
about the state the bodies were in, commenting that several of his men ended-up nauseous as 
a result of seeing them, as well as two of them becoming violently ill.&quot; She took note of 
Sir Integra&#39;s single blue eye rolling up in exasperation, and the Hellsing leader may have 
added her comments before, &quot;However, I did tell the commander that, rather than complain to 
us, then he should take-up his argument to recruiting, as they should&#39;ve avoided the whole 
affair by not selecting candidates for the army from the local nursery school.&quot; That got a 
few snickers from Rally and Seras, and even Bridgett enjoyed a laugh.

&quot;Exactly what I would have said. Brilliant, Moria,&quot; Sir Integra commented.

&quot;Why thank you, Sir Integra.&quot; Moria&#39;s expression then became grave. &quot;I also have the results 
of your other request - finding out the strength and organizational structure of the second 
target.&quot; She then gave Sir Integra several papers. &quot;As you are aware, you had concerns that 
the second &#39;super-gang&#39; may be better organized than the group of anarchists we dispatched 
of last night.. I received the report from Intelligence this past hour... and as you feared, 
they are much stronger than previously believed.&quot;

&quot;That bad, huh?&quot; muttered Rally, concerned.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Moria continued through the report. &quot;They seem to have an almost military-like 
efficiency to their attack, as well as how well guarded their &#39;headquarters&#39;, is.&quot;

&quot;Not &#39;lair&#39;? Isn&#39;t that too much credence?&quot; asked Seras.

&quot;I know that&#39;s giving these criminals far too much credit, but that&#39;s the best MI-5 has on 
them.&quot; A few more pages, &quot;Rather than engaging in the chaos the previous super-gang indulged 
in, these punks are attacking aid transports supplying the relief centres around the city.&quot;

&quot;Which would include the relief centre I tried to get supplies before setting-out to Mr. 
McGregor&#39;s place,&quot; Bridgett added, looking thoughtful.

&quot;Right.&quot; Moria then scratched her chin going over the facts. &quot;The thing I, as well as MI-5, 
is confused with is the amount of food, fuel, and warm clothing that has been stolen - in 
the amount of several tonnes! Not something your average survivalist group would engage 
in... which means they have something else in mind for the supplies.&quot; She then returned her 
gaze to Sir Integra, &quot;What has everyone concerned is that the military is considering 
doubling the guard around the supply convoys entering the city and the relief centres, which 
would subtract from order-keeping patrols within the city - which in-turn would afford some 
of the minor gangs still about a greater amount of latitude to do whatever they wish!&quot; Sir 
Integra turned around, taking in this new information. Rally, Seras and Moria all exchanged 
looks at each other, while Bridgett seemed deep in thought, oblivious to the four&#39;s 
activities.

&quot;I should have expected this!&quot; Sir Integra finally growled, turning around. &quot;It was not bad 
enough that the infernal Major, may he burn in Hell for all eternity, sent his FREAKs out 
against this city; even worst when Archbishop Maxwell, the same to him, took advantage of 
the situation to initiate his damned crusade!&quot; A look of fury came over the Hellsing 
leader&#39;s face, &quot;This war isn&#39;t over... the tactics have only changed! There may be no 
FREAKs, ghouls or priests to cause chaos... now that bloated Nazi pig has our own citizens 
at each other&#39;s throats!&quot; She then diverted her attention to the three women in front of 
her. &quot;Rally... Seras... Moria! Prepare yourselves! We are going to end this before this gets 
out of hand!&quot;

&quot;We?&quot; Rally seemed shocked.

&quot;Yes! I know Dr. Trevelyan will not approve because of my condition, but I plan to accompany 
you in the attack! Moria,&quot; she turned to the butler, &quot;have my gun, my sword, and my battle 
gear at the ready! We will show these brigands the TRUE meaning of blood... and... 
TERROR!!!&quot;

&quot;Sir Integra?&quot; The four women&#39;s attention was then focused on Bridgett, who for some reason 
had a determined look on her face. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind, I wish to accompany you!&quot;

&quot;Bridgett,&quot; Rally began uneasily, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t do it if I were you.&quot;

&quot;I agree with my childe,&quot; Seras added. &quot;We will be doing things that you might find 
frightening or appalling! It&#39;s best that you stay...&quot;

&quot;I DON&#39;T CARE!!&quot; Bridgett yelled, catching everyone off-guard. &quot;I&#39;ve seen my beautiful 
London torn apart by monsters too terrifying to behold! I&#39;ve also laid beside my dead mum as 
killer priests who began killing survivors after raking them down! I was also nearly raped 
by a group of murderers - and through a mistake by a dark angel,&quot; she looked at Rally - 
almost affectionately - &quot;was liberated from it! If I can live through that, then I believe I 
can survive a raid against those who&#39;ll tear my city apart further!&quot;

Sir Integra weighed Bridgett&#39;s words carefully. &quot;Rally did say you can fire a gun, so I 
believe there is no harm in you accompanying us.&quot; She then turned around, &quot;Moria, it is time 
we better prepare!&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sir Integra!&quot; The pretty butler accompanied her employer out of the room.

Seras also made her way out. &quot;I&#39;ll see if I can find a uniform for our little friend to 
wear.&quot; She eyed Rally and added, &quot;I suppose you have an adequate that she could use?&quot;

&quot;That I do, Master,&quot; Rally agreed, and watched as the No-Life Queen melted into the shadows.

&quot;Totally wicked!&quot; Bridgett breathed, seeing the way Seras disappear. She then looked over at 
Rally and added, &quot;I really mean what I said... there was blame in all fronts regarding what 
happened to me, so it was understandable you thought of me as one of those thugs.&quot; She then 
sat herself up and looked at the dusky vampire. &quot;So, your name is Rally, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Well... yeah,&quot; Rally agreed.

&quot;Good. Like that blonde vampire and Miss Hedgley said, I should be getting used to the likes 
of you.&quot; Looking at Rally&#39;s uniform, she added, &quot;So... aren&#39;t you going to change into that 
black outfit I saw you in earlier?&quot;, indicating to Rally&#39;s yellow uniform.

&quot;Oh that? Well, now that you&#39;ve mentioned it...&quot; Rally then closed her eyes as shadows 
encompassed her body. Soon, the yellow, white, and brown portions of the uniform were the 
same coal black. &quot;What do you think, Bridgett?&quot; she asked.

Bridgett was impressed. &quot;Now that... is wicked!&quot; For the strangest reason, the fear she felt 
originally with this vampire was replaced with fascination. &quot;One thing I do want answered 
before your blonde friend returns... how were you able to talk with Miss Hedgley without... 
talking?&quot;

Again, Rally felt uncomfortable, but sat down at the foot of Bridgett&#39;s bed. &quot;It&#39;s a good 
thing you&#39;re seated right now,&quot; she said, &quot;so I think I&#39;d better explain why... although I&#39;m 
a little confused on HOW.&quot; She then looked into Bridgett&#39;s eyes and added, &quot;But I have a 
feeling you might now like it much.&quot;
